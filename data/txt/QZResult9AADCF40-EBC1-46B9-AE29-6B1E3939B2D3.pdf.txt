Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and loss of the tumor suppressors Ink4a/Arf. Efforts at modeling GBM using wild-type EGFR in mice have
proven unsuccessful. Here, we present a unique mouse model of wild-type EGFR-driven gliomagenesis. We used a
combination of somatic conditional overexpression and ligand-mediated chronic activation of EGFR in
cooperation with Ink4a/Arf loss in the central nervous system of adult mice to generate tumors with the
histopathologic and molecular characteristics of human GBMs. Sustained, ligand-mediated activation of EGFR
was necessary for gliomagenesis, functionally substantiating the clinical observation that EGFR-positive GBMs
from patients express EGFR ligands. To gain a better understanding of the clinically disappointing EGFR-targeted
therapies for GBM, we investigated the molecular responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment in
this model. Geﬁtinib treatment of primary GBM cells resulted in a robust apoptotic response, partially conveyed
by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling attenuation and accompanied by BIMEL expression. In
human GBMs, loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor PTEN are a common occurrence. Elimination
of PTEN expression in GBM cells posttumor formation did not confer resistance to TKI treatment, showing that
PTEN status in our model is not predictive. Together, these ﬁndings offer important mechanistic insights into the
genetic determinants of EGFR gliomagenesis and sensitivity to TKIs and provide a robust discovery platform to
better understand the molecular events that are associated with predictive markers of TKI therapy. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiformes (GBM) are classiﬁed on the basis
of histopathologic features, clinical presentation and molecular characteristics (reviewed in refs. 1, 2). The hallmark features
of GBM are uncontrolled cellular proliferation, extensively
diffuse inﬁltration, and a propensity for hypoxia and necrosis
that engenders robust angiogenesis and a perennial resistance
to therapeutic intervention. The epidermal growth factor

receptor (EGFR) plays a crucial role in GBM pathogenesis
(3). The importance of this pathway is highlighted by the fact
that wild-type EGFR (EGFRWT) and its ligands are over
expressed and activated in more than 65% of GBM tumors
(4–6). While initiation of this tumor subtype requires the
overexpression of EGFRWT along with the concomitant loss
of the Cdkn2a (p16INK4A/p19ARF) tumor suppressor locus (7),
the role of EGFR signaling in tumor maintenance and sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is less well studied,
especially in animal models. Most of our knowledge of EGFR
signaling is based on in vitro studies of acute, ligand-mediated
activation of the receptor within minutes. This paradigm
differs from clinical observations, as EGFR is thought to be
chronically active in GBM because of autocrine/paracrine
expression of ligands including EGF, TGFa, and HB-EGF
(8–11). As such, studies based on clinically relevant mechanisms of response to EGFR inhibition remain largely unexplored,
especially in an in vivo model system.
The oncogene addiction hypothesis stipulates that a cancer
cell is physiologically dependent on the continued activity of an
oncogene for maintenance of the malignant phenotype (12).
Although the mechanistic details of oncogene addiction are
likely to be cancer speciﬁc, it appears that oncogenic kinases
transduce excessive survival signals through pathways that are

Ligand Requirement for EGFR-Driven Tumorigenesis

controlled by canonical growth and survival pathways [e.g., Akt
and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)]. Treatment of
oncogenically addicted cancer cells with kinase-inhibitory
drugs suppresses these signals, resulting in an oncogenic shock
characterized by the cessation of proliferation through a
variety of mechanisms including growth arrest, differentiation,
senescence, and apoptosis (reviewed in ref. 13). In vitro based
studies show that inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases in
GBM can lead to the rapid onset of apoptosis, suggesting that
GBMs also experience this addiction to oncogenic stimuli (14),
although the mechanistic details of oncogene addiction in
GBMs remain ill deﬁned.
The use of EGFR TKIs for GBM treatment has proven
surprisingly ineffective, resulting in gains of a few months of
progression-free survival, with no signiﬁcant gain in overall
survival (reviewed in ref. 15). Retrospective studies show that
patients who responded to TKI therapy had tumors harboring
EGFRvIII mutant receptors and an intact PTEN gene, whereas
the nonresponding patients had PTEN-null tumors (16, 17).
This ﬁnding led to the suggestion that loss of PTEN uncouples
PI3K–Akt signaling from the control of EGFR activity. By
freeing tumors from their addiction to oncogenic EGFR, PTEN
deletion may provide a means of resistance to TKI therapy.
However, these observations were not sustained in follow-up
phase I/II trial studies (18, 19) showing a vast complexity in the
molecular mechanisms of EGFR TKI therapy response.
Overcoming resistance to targeted therapeutics in patients
will require an in-depth understanding of the molecular
mechanisms of tumor cell resistance. Accurate and realistic
model systems can serve as a surrogate paradigm to predict
clinical testing, representing a rapid, inexpensive, and powerful
approach to this problem. However, there are currently no
mouse models of malignant glioma that use EGFRWT as an
oncogenic driver of tumorigenesis, making such studies impossible (20). Here we describe and validate a novel genetically
engineered mouse (GEM) model of EGFRWT-driven GBM. We
established that a strict spatiotemporal expression of EGFRWT
and chronic autocrine stimulation with a ligand, combined
with the loss of clinically relevant tumor suppressor genes
efﬁciently induces gliomagenesis. Using this novel mouse
model, we reveal that these GBM tumor cells are oncogenically
addicted to EGFR. Treatment with an EGFR TKI results in a
rapid BIMEL-mediated apoptotic response. We further show
that loss of PTEN posttumor formation does not uncouple
PI3K–Akt survival signaling from EGFR control and does not
induce TKI resistance. These ﬁndings are consistent with the
clinical observation that PTEN status is not a predictor of
EGFR TKI sensitivity.

Materials and Methods
EGFR conditional mice and procedures
Procedures were carried out in accordance with Tufts University's recommendations for care and use of animals and
were maintained and handled under protocols approved by
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Conditional expression of EGFRWT was achieved as previously
described (21). Viral vector construction, production, and

stereotactic injections are described in Supplementary Materials and Methods section.
Histology and immunodetection
Brains were either used to isolate primary cultures or
processed for histology (Supplementary Materials and Methods). Immunodetection of cytologic markers by immunohistochemistry and proteins were carried out using antibodies
and standard protocols (see Supplementary Materials and
Methods).
Survival assays and inhibitor treatments
Cell viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion and
XTT assays. Cells were treated with geﬁtinib (LC Labs) or
PD325901 (LC Labs) for 16 to 24 hours and the total number of
cells was reported.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using the 2-tailed,
unpaired Student t test in Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software).

Results
Ligand-mediated activation of wild-type EGFR in the
context of tumor suppressor loss in mice induces tumors
with histopathologic characteristics of human GBM
Many studies have reported the presence of autocrine and/
or paracrine expression of EGFR and its ligands in GBM tumors
(8–11). We validated these observations using The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) public database by conducting a gene
set enrichment analysis in GBMs with an ampliﬁed EGFR gene
locus that overexpress wild-type and point-mutant EGFR
versus non–EGFR-expressing tumors to determine whether
EGFR ligands are indeed preferentially expressed in EGFRpositive tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1C). Our analysis
reveals that human tumors that overexpress EGFR preferentially have a relatively high expression of EGF ligand than GBM
tumors with low EGFR expression levels (P ¼ 0.000076). These
results, combined with previously reported evidence of ligand–
receptor coexpression in GBM, show that physiologically relevant overexpression of EGFR is associated with ligand expression. This strong correlation between ligand and receptor
overexpression suggests that EGFRWT signaling can be chronically active in GBMs.
We recently supported these observations experimentally
in vivo by showing that overexpression of EGFRWT alone is
insufﬁcient to promote gliomagenesis (21). To model EGFRWTdriven GBM in mice, we developed a strategy to coexpress
TGFa, an EGFR ligand expressed in human GBMs (8, 11, 22–
26), and EGFRWT in the adult mouse brain. We used a Cre/Lox
conditional EGFRWT transgenic strain in which overexpression
of human EGFRWT is Cre-dependent (21). Robust EGFRWT
expression is triggered by the removal of a ﬂoxed translational
and transcriptional stop cassette (LSL), which attenuates the
activity of an artiﬁcial ubiquitous promoter (CAG). To simultaneously express Cre recombinase and TGFa, we created a
bicistronic lentiviral vector that expresses TGFa and Cre
(TGFa–IRES–iCre). A construct expressing eGFP in lieu of

Figure 1. Activated EGFR cooperates with loss of tumor suppressor genes to form brain tumors that have characteristics of GBM. A, schematic
representation of the pTyf lentiviral transducing vectors. This bicistronic vector is derived from a previously described self-inactivating virus (46) modiﬁed to
contain the human TGFa cDNA followed by a poliovirus1 IRES and improved Cre (iCre) cDNA (50) driven by the human elongation factor-1a (EF1a) promoter.
For control experiments, TGFa is replaced with the eGFP gene. The presence of a central polypurine tract (cPPT)-DNA FLAP element upstream of the multiple
cloning site signiﬁcantly improves the transduction efﬁciency in central nervous system tissues (48, 49). B, survival rate (Kaplan–Meier) analysis of conditional

IRES–iCre and monitored for survival over time. C, photomicrograph of a hematoxylin and eosin–stained coronal section of a TGFa–EGFRWT;InkD2/3/ brain
tumor. Scale bar, 2.0 mm.

TGFa serves as a control vector (eGFP–IRES–iCre; Fig. 1A). We
induced the coexpression of TGFa (or eGFP) and EGFRWT by
conducting stereotactic intracranial injections of matched
titers (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B) of TGFa–IRES–iCre
and eGFP–IRES–iCre viruses in cohorts of conditional CAG–
LSL–EGFRWT;InkD2/3/ compound mice and monitored
tumor formation and survival over time. Mice coexpressing
EGFRWT and TGFa in a p16Ink4a/p19Arf null background developed brain tumors with a median survival of 10 weeks postinjection (Fig. 1B). Neither expression of EGFRWT in the
absence of ligand, nor expression of TGFa in the absence of
transgenic EGFRWT resulted in tumor formation in p16Ink4a/
p19Arf null mice, supporting the hypothesis that receptor and
ligand coexpression are required for EGFRWT-driven gliomagenesis in mice.
TGFa–EGFRWT;InkD2/3/ tumors share many histopathologic features with human GBMs (Fig. 1C). They are highly
cellular, very proliferative (numerous mitoses), and are composed of cells displaying pleomorphic nuclei present on a
ﬁbrillary background (Fig. 2A). In addition, the tumors include
giant multinucleated cells and areas of pseudopallisading
necrosis, both prominent features of human GBM (Fig. 2B and
C). Moreover, these tumors are highly inﬁltrative with leptomeningeal spread (Fig. 2D) and diffuse inﬁltration into normal
parenchyma (Fig. 2E). Tumor cells are also found in the
perivascular space and can be observed at signiﬁcant distance
from the bulk mass (Fig. 2F). Immunohistochemical staining of
TGFa–EGFRWT;InkD2/3/ tumors for EGFR revealed robust
membrane expression, whereas staining for markers associ-

ated with astrocytic (glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein and S100)
and neuronal (NeuN) differentiation revealed that the neoplastic cells express markers of astrocytic lineage (Fig. 2G). In
addition, the levels of EGFR expression seen in these tumors
are similar to those observed in human GBMs with an ampliﬁed EGFR locus (Supplementary Fig. S3) and these cells
recapitulate growth and histopathologic features of the original tumors when orthotopically allografted in mice (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B).
Signaling through constitutively activated EGFRWT in
GBM cells
Signaling events resulting from a chronic activation of
EGFRWT in GBM have yet to be studied in detail. To understand
EGFRWT signaling events in this context, we established a
series of primary cultures from TGFa–EGFRWT;InkD2/3/
tumors. These primary cultures are stable, show unrestricted
growth in low serum conditions (Supplementary Fig. S5), and
produce and secrete TGFa (Supplementary Fig. S6A). This
TGFadriven growth is markedly reduced when the cultures
are incubated with an antiTGFa antibody (Supplementary
Fig. S6B) thus indicating that TGFa–EGFRWT-driven signaling
is sufﬁcient to support tumor cell growth and maintenance. We
next used these primary GBM cells to ascertain the effects of
EGFR inhibition on cell growth and signaling.
To decipher EGFR signaling in our GBM tumor cultures,
we surveyed EGFR's phosphotyrosine levels by immunoblot
analysis. The phosphorylation levels of the canonical tyrosine
residues 845, 1,045, 1,068, 1,148, and 1,173 decreased

dramatically upon EGFR kinase inhibition (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the levels of pTyr992 increased upon geﬁtinib treatment.
Next, we determined the levels of activation and the effect of
EGFR inhibition on the canonical EGFR signaling pathways
driven by MAPK and PI3K–Akt. We found that the MAPK
pathway (Mek1/2–Erk1/2) is highly active in TGFa–EGFRWT;
InkD2/3/ tumor cells and inhibition of EGFR with geﬁtinib
dramatically reduces Mek1/2–Erk1/2 signaling (Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, the PI3K–Akt pathway is not activated in TGFa–
EGFRWT;InkD2/3/ tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S7).
We then ascertained the effect of EGFR kinase inhibition on
cell growth. We ﬁrst calculated the IC50 values for geﬁtinib
using an in vitro cell growth assay (Supplementary Fig. S8) and
determined that treatment with 10 mmol/L of geﬁtinib for 24
hours results in maximal growth inhibition. Geﬁtinib treatment of TGFa–EGFRWT;InkD2/3/ tumor cultures (T1–T3)
resulted in a 50% to 80% reduction in viability (Fig. 4A). We
surmised that the decrease in viability might be because of an
increased rate of apoptosis. Using ﬂow cytometry, the levels of
apoptosis in TGFa–EGFRWT;InkD2/3/ tumor cultures, as
measured by the percentage of cells expressing cleaved caspase-3, increased dramatically after 24 hours of geﬁtinib
treatment (Fig. 4B and C). This increase in apoptosis is
conﬁrmed by detecting the presence of cleaved PARP (Fig.
4D) and can be observed as early as 4 hours after geﬁtinib
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S9). A similar apoptotic

response was brought about by identical concentrations of
erlotinib (data not shown).
To validate these results, we treated animals with actively
growing orthotopically allografted TGFa–EGFRWT;InkD2/3/
GBM cells with erlotinib and assessed tumor response (Fig. 5A–
C). Within 48 hours of treatment, the levels of phospho-EGFR are
no longer detectable, the levels of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)
incorporation in GBM cells are drastically decreased and there is
a marked increase in the number of apoptotic cells as measured
by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) assay (Fig. 5A–C).
Elevation of BIMEL expression upon attenuation of EGFR
signaling
Acute inhibition of constitutively activated EGFR using TKIs
has been shown to result in an apoptotic response that is
mediated by an increase in the expression of the proapoptotic
protein BIM (27) as a result of the attenuation of MAPK
signaling (28, 29). To gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for the EGFR TKI–mediated apoptosis observed in our
EGFRWT-driven tumor cell cultures, we measured the expression of BIM in cells treated with geﬁtinib or the Mek1/2
inhibitor PD325901 and carried out cell growth assays.
Figure 6A and B show that inhibition of EGFR causes
an increase in the expression of the long form of BIM (BIMEL)
and that BIMEL expression is partly mediated by the

more modest apoptotic response as measured both molecularly and physiologically.
Modulation of PTEN expression in established tumor
cultures has no therapeutic consequence
Loss of function of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN is a
common occurrence in GBM tumors. Originally, studies in
patients indicated that GBM tumors with an intact PTEN were
more sensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitors than those with PTEN
deﬁciencies (16). However, these observations were not sustained in follow-up studies suggesting that PTEN status has
little predictive value for EGFR TKI treatment response. To
determine whether PTEN contributes to the sensitivity of our
GBM tumor cell cultures to EGFR kinase inhibition, we eliminated PTEN expression in our TGFa–EGFRWT;InkD2/3/
tumor cells using a potent short hairpin RNA (Supplementary
Fig. S10) and analyzed these cultures for their sensitivity to
geﬁtinib treatment.
Elimination of PTEN expression in these cells resulted in the
activation of the PI3K–Akt signaling axis as measured by the
appearance of activated Akt (Fig. 7A). However, this newly
acquired PI3K–Akt signaling remains dependent on the activity of EGFR, as geﬁtinib treatment completely eliminated Akt
phosphorylation. PTEN knockdown in TGFa–EGFRWT;InkD2/
3/ tumor cells did not result in an increased resistance to
geﬁtinib treatment, as measured by similar levels of apoptosis
in control and PTEN knockdown cells when ascertained by
immunoblot (Fig. 7A) or cell viability assay (Fig. 7B).

Discussion
Numerous in vitro studies showed that overexpression of
EGFRWT leads to cellular transformation only in the presence

7202

Cancer Res; 71(23) December 1, 2011

of ligands (30–36). This requirement for coexpression of receptor and ligand for oncogenic transformation is also exempliﬁed
in animal models where simple overexpression of nonmutant
EGFR in different tissues, including glia, results in hyperplasia
rather than tumor formation (37–39). We have recently shown
that somatic overexpression of EGFRWT in the central nervous
system of mice is incapable of forming glioma (21). Moreover,
autocrine/paracrine coexpression of EGFR and its ligands EGF,
TGFa, or HB-EGF has been shown in various human tumors,
including gliomas (8–10, 22–26, 40), an observation that we
validated using the TCGA public database. Together, these
studies propose the notion that physiologically relevant overexpression of EGFRWT is not an oncogenic event in and of itself
and that coexpression of a ligand may be required to initiate
tumorigenesis. In this report, we present experimental data
that support this hypothesis by showing for the ﬁrst time the
need for an EGFR ligand (TGFa) to initiate GBM tumor
formation with EGFRWT in the context of p16Ink4a/p19Arf
nullizygosity in the mouse.
Expression of TGFa in gliomas is well established
(8, 11, 22–26, 32, 33) and it has been shown that there are
no differences between EGF- and TGFa-stimulated EGFR
signaling events (41), thus offering a compelling rationale
for its use in our studies. Moreover, soluble EGFR ligands
are produced as membrane-bound propeptides that are
proteolytically cleaved to release an active ligand from
their membrane tethers. We found that mature, active TGFa
but not EGF (data not shown) can be expressed from
an artiﬁcial cDNA corresponding to the postproteolytic
product.
Our GEM model offers a unique system to study the potential effects that TGFa may exert on the parenchyma. It is
conceivable that the expression of exogenous TGFa inﬂuences
the tumor microenvironment in a way that would promote
GBM cell growth. Given the emergence of data showing the
importance of the microenvironment on tumor behavior (42),
it is likely that TGFa impacts tumor growth beyond its
autocrine role and our model represents a relevant stage to
research this phenomenon.
GBM tumors are now categorized into 4 subgroups
termed proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal, based
on well-deﬁned molecular characteristics (recently reviewed
in ref. 1). The combination of EGFR overexpression and
Cdkn2a loss is found in nearly 65% of all GBMs and is a key
molecular component that deﬁnes the classical GBM subgroup (6). Our knowledge of EGFR signaling is mostly
derived from in vitro studies of acute, short-term stimulation
of the receptor with exogenous ligands. Although informative in many respects, including the establishment of EGFR
signaling networks (3), this paradigm falls short in clinical
relevancy in that it does not address signaling events that
emanate from chronically activated receptors. More importantly, these short-term in vitro studies are inadequate to
determine the cellular effects of inhibition of a chronically
active receptor. Our model, which is based on relevant
genetic aberrations, recapitulates hallmark histopathologic
features of GBMs including uncontrolled cellular growth,
massive invasion, and inﬁltration of tumor cells in

Activation of EGFR leads to the creation of phosphotyrosine (pTyr) residues on the receptor itself and on substrate
proteins. These pTyr sites are beacons for a host of SH2 and
PTB domain-containing signaling proteins capable of

surrounding normal parenchyma and pseudopallisading
necrosis. Moreover, our model establishes a clinically relevant baseline upon which studies of oncogenic EGFRWT
signaling can be carried out.

phosphotyrosine-dependent sequence-speciﬁc recognition
and binding, resulting in the transmission of highly precise
signals (reviewed in ref. 43). Knowledge of these sites is an
invaluable tool in determining the signaling events that
emanate from a receptor. In our studies, the inhibition of
EGFR kinase activity with geﬁtinib resulted in a drastic
decrease in the levels of the canonical pTyr residues we
surveyed, with the exception of pTyr992, which was
increased. Decreases in levels of phosphorylation at tyrosine
residues 1,068, 1,148, and 1,173 are expected to result in an
attenuation of MAPK signaling (44). Tyrosine 845 is a target
of Src family kinases (44) and a reduction in the levels of
phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 845 indicate a reduction
in Src activity. Phosphorylation on tyrosine 1,045 creates a
binding site for the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl (44). A decrease in
the levels of phosphorylation on tyrosine 1,045 would possibly lead to a lower rate of receptor degradation.
EGFR pTyr992 is a substrate for the tyrosine phosphatase
SHP-2 (45). The observed increase of pTyr992 levels upon
geﬁtinib treatment may result from a shift in the balance
between the activities of EGFR and SHP-2. On the other hand,
binding of a high afﬁnity SH2 or PTB domain–containing
protein to pTyr992 may be increased upon geﬁtinib treatment,
which would then result in protection of this residue from the
activity of phosphatases. Regardless of the mechanism
involved, phosphorylation on Tyr992 creates a binding site for
the SH2 domains of phospholipase C-g, RAS-GAP, and Vav2
(45–47). Our results suggest that a sustained increase in
signaling from these effector proteins in our cells may result
from geﬁtinib treatment. Alternatively, other as of yet unidentiﬁed signaling molecules may be recruited and activated by
this increase in pTyr992. We show that inhibition of a chronically activated receptor has different consequences than that
of an acutely stimulated receptor. Under these clinically relevant parameters, there is a renewed interest in studying
downstream signaling upon inhibition of EGFR kinase activity.

Ligand Requirement for EGFR-Driven Tumorigenesis

The canonical Mek1/2–Erk1/2 and PI3K–Akt signaling axes
are well-described effector pathways for EGFR. We show that
in our tumor cells, MAPK signaling is used by EGFR (Fig. 3).
However, to our surprise, we did not detect PI3K–Akt activation (as measured by the levels of phospho-Akt). This result is
surprising given the long-standing notion that EGFR strongly
signals through PI3K. Perhaps in the chronic setting of our in
vivo GBM model, tumor cells select for non–PI3K-dependent
prosurvival signals. The cells from this tumor model are
addicted to EGFR activity for maintenance, as inhibition of
EGFR with geﬁtinib results in a rapid (4–8 hours) induction of
apoptosis, which is associated with the appearance of BIMEL
expression. We further show that the increased BIMEL expression is partly mediated by MAPK activity as inhibition of
Mek1/2 leads to a partial apoptotic response and attenuated
BIMEL expression as compared with geﬁtinib treatment. These
results indicate that EGFR signals through additional, as of yet
unidentiﬁed pathways that when inhibited, feed into the
mechanism of BIMEL expression. BIM is a proapoptotic protein
known to interact with and inhibit the antiapoptotic activity of
Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1 (reviewed in ref. 29). Our observations
are reminiscent of examples in non–small cell lung cancers
(NSCLC) that are addicted to oncogenic EGFR, where TKI
treatment results in apoptosis (reviewed in ref. 48). The
mechanistic details connecting loss of EGFR kinase activity
and initiation of apoptosis still remain unclear but reported
data in NSCLC suggest that the apoptosis is mediated by a Mcl1/Bim axis (49).
Loss of PTEN is commonly associated with GBMs. Molecularly, loss of PTEN is thought to uncouple PI3K activity from
the control of EGFR, thus rendering tumor cells insensitive to
EGFR TKI therapy. However, this simplistic molecular view of
PTEN function does not harmonize with clinical data and
reveals the complexities associated with PTEN-modulated
signaling events. Here, we show that eliminating PTEN posttumor formation does not uncouple PI3K from EGFR and does

not confer resistance to EGFR TKI treatment. Our results are in
line with the clinical observations that PTEN status does not
predict response to EGFR TKI treatment.
The results presented here show that chronic activation of
EGFRWT is necessary for gliomagenesis and that the resulting
tumors are addicted to EGFR activity. Our model is the ﬁrst
EGFRWT glioma model, which provides a paradigm for studies
of signaling events in the clinically relevant context of human
GBMs with ampliﬁcation and overexpression of wild-type,
nonmutated EGFR. Loss of PTEN posttumor formation does
not confer resistance to TKI therapy, reafﬁrming that patient
selection for EGFR TKI therapy may not be based on PTEN
status alone.
