Abstract
Gene expression proﬁling aimed at classifying and prognosing breast cancer has yielded signatures with little, if
any, concordance. However, expression arrays used in these studies do not discriminate alternate RNA splice
isoforms that vary widely in cancer and may resolve this problem. In this study, we proﬁled splice isoforms in a
panel of tamoxifen-sensitive and -resistant cell lines, deﬁning a novel variant (BQ323636.1) of the nuclear receptor
corepressor 2 (NCOR2) that was associated with tamoxifen resistance. Overexpression of this variant in a
tamoxifen-sensitive cell line induced its resistance to tamoxifen. We conﬁrmed our initial ﬁndings from cell lines
in 77 breast tumors from a Chinese cohort, where BQ323636.1 expression was higher in tamoxifen-resistant
patients than tamoxifen-sensitive patients. For patients who were estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and had
received tamoxifen treatment, higher BQ323636.1 expression level correlated with distant metastasis. High
expression level of BQ323636.1 was found to be associated with poorer overall and disease-free survival for
patients who had received tamoxifen treatment. Notably, higher BQ323636.1 versus NCOR2 wild-type ratio was
also associated with negative ER and progesterone receptor (PR) status, and triple-negative status (ER/PR/
HER2 receptor status). Mechanistic investigations showed that under conditions of tamoxifen exposure,
BQ323636.1 suppressed the transcriptional activity of ERa, exhibiting promoter-regulating functions. Our
ﬁndings highlight a novel splice variant of the ERa corepressor NCOR2 as a candidate biomarker in breast
cancer that not only predicts tamoxifen response but may be targeted to overcome tamoxifen resistance. Cancer

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most prevalent female cancer worldwide. About 70% of breast cancers express estrogen receptor
(ER), a member of the nuclear hormone family of intracellular receptors. Estrogen binds to the ligand-binding domain
of the ER and induces conformational change in protein
structure for dimerization that is favorable for subsequent
interaction with coactivator molecules (1). The activated ER
then transactivates estrogen-responsive genes and induces
subsequent cell response.

Tamoxifen, a selective ER modulator, is commonly used as
ﬁrst-line adjuvant treatment to prevent cancer recurrence for
ER-positive (ERþ) breast cancers. It reduces the annual breast
cancer mortality by one-third and disease recurrence by almost
half (2). In breast tissues, tamoxifen acts as an antagonist of ER,
competes with estrogen for binding to ER, blocks the transcription activation activity of ER, and arrests cancer cells in
the cell cycle. However, almost half of the patients with
prolonged tamoxifen treatment will fail to respond to tamoxifen over time and develop disease recurrence eventually, that
is, acquired tamoxifen resistance (3) for reasons as yet unclear.
Postulated mechanisms are loss of ER expression, aberrant
changes in coregulators, dysregulation of receptor tyrosine
kinase signaling or cell survival signaling, and apoptosis (4).
Numerous gene expression proﬁling studies (5–10) have
been done by different research groups with the aim of
improving prognostication and classiﬁcation of breast cancers,
including tamoxifen responsiveness, to assist the selection of
patients for the most appropriate adjuvant systemic therapies.
However, each of the studies provided gene lists showing very
little concordance in gene identity.
Alternative splicing is a key posttranscriptional mechanism for generating multiple protein products from a single
gene, occurring in perhaps 40% to 60% of human genes.
Alternatively spliced isoforms of a given protein can display

A Novel NCOR2 Variant Associated with Tamoxifen Resistance

different and even antagonistic biologic functions. Microarray chips detect a small fragment of each gene transcript
and unless speciﬁcally designed, are unlikely to discriminate the expression of all possible isoforms for most of
the genes studied. Over or reduced expression of some gene
isoforms that have different functions from their wild-type
might account for differences in gene identity between the
different gene expression proﬁle models. In recent years,
various studies have revealed a number of alternatively
spliced variants that are associated with cancers (11, 12).
Splicing microarray proﬁling in prostate cancer found that
30% splice variants of 222 prostate cancer–related genes
had signiﬁcant changes in expression between tumors and
normal samples (13). A number of alternative spliced
variants that distinguished tumors from normal tissues
have also been identiﬁed in ovarian and breast cancers
(14, 15).
We postulated that alternatively spliced variants may play
a role in tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer and conducted
custom designed splice variant proﬁling on a panel of breast
cancer cell lines with differential response to tamoxifen treatment. A novel splice variant of the gene NCOR2 was identiﬁed
that was differentially expressed between parental tamoxifensensitive and -derived resistant breast cancer cell lines. The
variant was further validated to signiﬁcantly correlate with
tamoxifen resistance and poor survival in breast cancers.
Subsequent functional studies were carried out to elucidate
the underlying role of this splice variant in tamoxifen
resistance.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and ZR-75-1 were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection and were
authenticated by short tandem repeat proﬁling. MCF7 was
cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 ng/mL human recombinant insulin
and ZR-75-1 was cultured in Improved Minimum Essential
Medium (IMEM) supplemented with 5% FBS. LCC2 and AK-47
were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Clarke (Georgetown University Medical School, Washington, D.C.; ref. 16). LCC2, a
tamoxifen-resistant cell line derived from MCF7/LCC1 by
stepwise in vitro selection of prolonged tamoxifen treatment
was cultured in IMEM supplemented with 5% charcoalstripped FBS and AK47, derived from ZR75-1, was cultured in
IMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS.
Human breast cancer samples
Primary tumors were collected from 77 patients diagnosed with breast cancer between the years 1993 and
2001 at Queen Mary Hospital (Hong Kong, China). Five- to
10-year clinical follow-up data and clinicopathologic information were available. The protocol was approved by the
Institutional Review Board (UW 06-379 T/1404). Histologic
sections of all cases were reviewed by a pathologist. Sections
containing at least 70% of invasive carcinoma were used for
total RNA extraction.

www.aacrjournals.org

Total RNA extraction
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used for total RNA extraction. Breast cancer frozen tissues were cut in 20-mm thick
cryostat sections for total RNA extraction.
SpliceArray proﬁling
SpliceArray proﬁling was conducted by ExonHit Therapeutics, Inc. Custom designed 4  44K microarray slides from
Agilent Technologies were used. The probe sets were designed
to detect the wild-type forms as recommended in National
Center for Biotechnology Information RefSeq and all possible
alternatively spliced forms. Each alternative splice event can be
modeled with a short and a long form. The reference sequence
of this gene can be either the short form or long form,
depending on the alternative splice event type, and the alternatively spliced variant will be the other form.
A panel of breast cancer cell lines with differential response
to tamoxifen was used in the SpliceArray proﬁling, as shown in
Supplementary Table S1A. The cell lines were treated at
tamoxifen concentrations 0 mmol/L, 0.1 mmol/L, and 1
mmol/L for 5 days before RNA extraction. Every sample was
cultured and sampled in triplicate. All RNA samples went
through quality control before cDNA synthesis and Cy3 dye
labeling.
SpliceArray proﬁling analysis was conducted using Partek
Genomics Suite. Analysis was conducted on each cell line
cDNA sample individually. The probe intensity data were
Log2 transformed then quartile normalized to make the distribution of probe set intensities for each array similar within
the set of arrays. Low or nonexpressed probe sets were ﬁltered
out if all samples' intensity values fell below the predetermined
Log2-based value.
Statistical analysis
For data obtained from the array proﬁling, a two-way
ANOVA model was used to conduct statistical tests on the
ﬁltered probe set level intensities between each cell line sample
group to generate P values and fold change values. "Top hit lists"
were generated with P  0.05 and fold change  1.8 as the cutoff,
representing signiﬁcant differences between the samples being
compared. Clustering of the proﬁling data was conducted using
Cluster 3.0 (17) and visualized using Java TreeView (18).
In vivo correlation analysis was based on the clinicopathologic characteristics of the 77 Chinese breast cancer samples
collected from Queen Mary Hospital as described above. The
expression levels of splice variant BQ323636.1 were analyzed
against the tamoxifen responsiveness of the patients with
breast cancer and other clinicopathologic features by independent sample t test. Survival analyses were done by Kaplan–
Meier estimates and Cox regression model. P values of less than
0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Real-time quantitative PCR
Up to 5 mg of total RNAs were reverse transcribed into cDNA
by SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time
PCR reaction was carried out with the ABI 7900HT Fast Realtime PCR system. For TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR

(qPCR), a standard curve was set up for quantiﬁcation. The
reaction volume was 15 mL in 96-well plate and 10 mL in 384well plate. The reaction consisted of 1 TaqMan Universal PCR
Master Mix, No AmpErase UNG (Applied Biosystems), 0.1
mmol/L 6-carboxyﬂuorescein-labeled TaqMan MGB probe,
0.4 mmol/L forward and reverse primers, and 2 mL cDNA. The
2-step thermal cycling method consisted of 95 C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 seconds, and 60 C for
60 seconds. The primer and TaqMan probe sequences used
were presented in Supplementary Table S2.
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed and SDS-PAGE was conducted as previously described (19). Harvested cells were lysed in protein
lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) containing 1  Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride. Twenty micrograms of each protein sample
were separated by SDS-PAGE using 8% gel. The proteins then
were transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membrane
(Millipore) and probed with monoclonal antibody against
NCOR2 (A01, Abnova), ERa (HC-20, Santa Cruz Biotech),
6xHis-tag (9F2, Wako), and b-actin (AC-74, Sigma). Secondary antibodies were: horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
anti-rabbit antibody (P0448, Dako) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated afﬁniPure anti-mouse antibody (Jackson
ImmnunoResearch Laboratories).
MTT assay
Cells were seeded at a density of 1.5  104 in 96-well plates.
On the day of conducting MTT assay, cells were incubated with
culture medium containing 10% MTT (USB, Affymetrix) stock
solution (5 mg/mL) at 37 C for 4 hours. After incubation, the
medium was discarded and replaced with 100 mL isopropanol
with 4 mmol/L HCl and 0.1% NP-40 to dissolve the purple
precipitates. Extinction of the samples was measured by the
Inﬁnite 200 microtiter plate reader (Tecan) at 570 nm with a
reference wavelength at 750 nm. Background MTT readings
were subtracted from the samples.
Plasmids
pcDNA3.1-BQ323636.1 was constructed by inserting the
human variant BQ323636.1 cDNA into pcDNA3.1(þ) (Invitrogen). pcDNA3.1-6xHis-BQ323636.1 was constructed by Dr. Tori
Chan, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. pcDNA3.1ERa was constructed by inserting full-length human ERa
cDNA into pcDNA3.1(þ). The luciferase reporter ERE-E1b-Luc
was a gift from Dr. Carolyn Smith (Baylor College of Medicine,
Houston, TX; ref. 20) and ERE-TK-Luc was a gift from Dr. HungYing Kao (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH;
ref. 21).
Transient transfection and luciferase assay
The ERE ﬁreﬂy reporter and pRL-SV40 were cotransfected
with pcDNA3.1-ERa and pcDNA3.1-BQ323636.1 or its empty
vector into HeLa cells with Lipofectamine 2000 transfection
reagent (Invitrogen). Cells grown to 90% conﬂuence were
grown in Opti-MEM I-reduced serum medium without phenol
red before transfection. The cells were transfected with desired

amount of DNA or Lipofectamine 2000 reagent following the
manufacturer's instruction. Six hours after transfection, the
medium was changed to complete medium and incubated at
37 C with 5% CO2.
After ligand treatment for 24 hours, the activities of ﬁreﬂy
and renilla luciferases were measured sequentially using dualluciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to manufacturer's protocol. The intensities of ﬁreﬂy and renilla luminescence were recorded by Inﬁnite F200 (Tecan). Background
readings were subtracted from the samples.

Results
Eleven splice variants that were differentially expressed
between tamoxifen sensitive and resistant breast cancer
cell lines were selected for validation
To identify the alternatively spliced variants that correlate with tamoxifen resistance status in breast cancer,
custom designed SpliceArray proﬁling was conducted.
Breast cancer–related genes involved in cell signaling, cell
proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and invasion, 417 in
total, were chosen for proﬁling study. These 417 genes had
a total of 4,088 evidence events investigated that were
represented by 21,249 evidence probes. The evidence event
refers to all the known and predicted alternative splice
events identiﬁed in publicly available sequence databases
of the gene.
A panel of breast cancer cell lines with differential response
to tamoxifen was used in the SpliceArray proﬁling (Supplementary Table S1A). AK 47 (ER-negative) can still respond to
tamoxifen treatment; however, it is more resistant to tamoxifen compared with its parental cell line ZR-75-1 (ERþ) as its
IC50 was much higher (Supplementary Fig. S1). Cell line RNA
samples were prepared in independent triplicates. The expression level of each alternatively spliced variant is expressed as
the probe intensities of long form versus short form ratio. A
large number of splice variants that had expression levels
correlating with ER status or tamoxifen responsiveness status
in the panel of breast cancer cell lines screened were observed
(data not shown). To identify the signiﬁcant and meaningful
splice variants that are truly involved in tamoxifen resistance,
splice variants that fulﬁlled at least one of the criteria below
were selected:
(i) At basal level, they were differentially expressed (fold
change >1.8, P < 0.05) between tamoxifen-sensitive
(TamS) and tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) cell lines in
both 2 pairs, that is, MCF7 versus LCC2; ZR75-1 versus
AK47;
(ii) Under tamoxifen treatment, they had opposite trend of
change (fold change >1.8, P < 0.05) between TamS and
TamR cell lines in both pairs;
(iii) At basal level, they were differentially expressed (fold
change >1.8, P < 0.05) between ERþ and ER cell lines.
The signiﬁcant fold change cutoff was set at 1.8, as this is the
minimum difference that may be detected by TaqMan realtime quantitative PCR. Using these criteria, 11 splice variants of

Figure 1. Fold changes of the validated splice variants' expression levels
by qPCR. Fold changes of the validated splice variants in MCF7/LCC2
(gray bars) and AK47/ZR75-1 (black bars) cell line pairs were presented in
log2 scale. Negative fold changes represent upregulation of the
variant, whereas positive fold changes represent downregulation of the
variant. Data are expressed as mean  SD of 3 independent experiments.

5 genes were selected (Supplementary Fig. S2) and subjected to
validation by qPCR. The validation results were summarized in
Supplementary Table S1B and the fold changes of their long
versus short form ratio within the cell line pairs are illustrated
in Fig. 1. At basal level (without tamoxifen treatment), 4 splice
variants were validated in MCF7/LCC2 cell line pair and 5
splice variants were validated in ZR75-1/AK47 cell line pair
(Fig. 1).
One of the splice variants of TGF-b1, BF756452.1, with a
novel alternative splice acceptor site of 41 bps at the 50 end
upstream of exon 10 and a novel stop codon that leads to early
termination of the protein before exon 10 was downregulated
the most in both cell line pairs. The other splice variant
BU149200.1, with a novel intron of 139 bps within the last
exon, was the most upregulated variant in both cell line pairs.
The splice variants of TGF-b1 validated from our study are
being further investigated, but are outside the context of this
article.
Splice variant of ERa, AX066402.1, with a deletion of the ﬁrst
151 amino acids at the N-terminal of the protein due to exon 1
skipping had the relative large fold change in AK47/ZR75-1 cell
line pair. However, because both the variant and the ERa wildtype had very low or no expression in ER cell lines, its
functional signiﬁcance in ER cells was limited, thus it was
not chosen for functional studies.
Besides the 3 variants introduced above, fold change of
BQ323636.1, a novel variant of nuclear receptor corepressor
2 (NCOR2), was signiﬁcantly upregulated in AK47 compared
with ZR75-1 (2.5-fold in log2 scale). Exon 11 skipping in this
splice variant leads to early termination of the protein product.
Considering the known biologic functions of the genes validated in this study, NCOR2 was the most likely to bear
functional relationship with tamoxifen resistance. It interacts
with ERa when ERa is complexed with tamoxifen and
represses the transcriptional activity of ERa. It has been shown
to be directly involved in the antagonist activity of tamoxifen
on ERa. Therefore, its splice variant, BQ323636.1, may play an
important role in tamoxifen resistance and was selected for
further analysis.

Differential expression of a novel splice variant of NCOR2
between tamoxifen-sensitive and -resistant breast
cancer cell lines
By SpliceArray proﬁling, we had identiﬁed a novel alternatively spliced variant BQ323636.1 that was signiﬁcantly differentially expressed in both MCF7/LCC2 and ZR75-1/AK47 cell
line pairs both at basal level and under tamoxifen treatment
(Supplementary Table S1B). BQ323636.1 has exon 11 skipped in
mature mRNA, which results in early termination of its protein
product, retaining only the N-terminal of the NCOR2 wild-type
protein (Fig. 2A). To validate the differential expression of
splice variant BQ323636.1 between TamS and TamR cell lines
at the mRNA level, real-time TaqMan qPCR was conducted on
a new batch of cell line mRNA samples in triplicates. Primers
were designed to speciﬁcally target either this splice variant or
the NCOR2 wild-type form (NM_006312; Fig. 2B).
In the ZR75-1/AK47 cell line pair, qPCR results expressed as
long versus short form (Fig. 2C, i), showed consistent results as
in the SpliceArray proﬁling. To represent the expression level of
BQ323636.1 in relation to that of its wild-type BQ323636.1
versus wild-type ratio (BQ/WT ratio), that is, the short versus
long form, is shown in Fig. 2C, ii. Consistent with SpliceArray
proﬁling data, the BQ/WT ratio was signiﬁcantly higher in
AK47 cell line (derived TamR) compared with its ZR75-1 cell
line (parental TamS) by about 2-fold, both at basal level and
under tamoxifen treatment. However, qPCR validation was
unable to show signiﬁcant differential expression of
BQ323636.1 variant between the MCF7 and LCC2 cell line pair
(data not shown). This may imply that the biologic role of
BQ323636.1 in tamoxifen resistance involves loss of ER
expression.
In addition, we also examined the expression level of the
variant alone (Fig. 2C, iii) or wild-type alone (Fig. 2C, iv).
Differential expression of BQ323636.1 was only observed under
tamoxifen treatment, but not at basal level. This difference was
however not observed for the NCOR2 wild-type. The differential
expression of BQ323636.1 only under tamoxifen treatment for
an ER TamR cell line suggests its potential functional role of
this variant in presence of tamoxifen.
Expression of splice variant BQ323636.1 correlated with
tamoxifen response status in cell lines
The protein product of the variant BQ323636.1 was predicted to be a truncated protein product of 362 amino acids
with molecular mass of 42.6 kDa. Its amino acid sequence
corresponds to the N-terminus of NCOR2 wild-type protein,
with only the last 10 amino acids before the stop codon
translated from exon 12 out of frame (Fig. 2A).
If the differential expression of BQ323636.1 observed
between ZR75-1 and AK47 has a functional role in biologic
processes, such differential expression is also expected at the
protein level. A NCOR2 polyclonal antibody (A01, Abnova)
targets the ﬁrst 1–111 amino acids of wild-type NCOR2 and
was used to detect the protein product of BQ323636.1 in
Western blot analysis. This antibody can detect the wild-type
NCOR2 at size 250 kDa and the variant at size 42.6 kDa,
respectively. Between protein size 40 and 50 kDa, a protein
band was observed in both ZR75-1 and AK47, identiﬁed as the

was signiﬁcantly higher than in ZR75-1 compared with that of
wild-type. At basal level, such difference was also observed, but
not as signiﬁcant as under tamoxifen treatment.
To investigate whether the upregulation of BQ323636.1 was
the cause of tamoxifen resistance, BQ323636.1 was transiently
transfected into ERþ, tamoxifen-sensitive cell line ZR-75-1,
and MTT assays were conducted to assess the proliferation of
cells in response to tamoxifen treatment. The decrease in cell
proliferation observed under tamoxifen treatment was slower
in BQ323636.1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3B) than that of the
vector control over a range of drug concentrations. This
difference was statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) under 15
mmol/L tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 3C), indicating that the
variant can mediate tamoxifen resistance in ERþ cells as well.
BQ323636.1 expression correlated with tamoxifen
resistance, poor prognosis, and poor survival in Chinese
patients with breast cancers
To reveal the clinical signiﬁcance of this variant in vivo, we
investigated for possible correlation of BQ323636.1 expression

with clinicopathologic parameters in 77 breast cancer samples.
BQ323636.1 mRNA expression was examined by TaqMan realtime qPCR and analyzed between clinical parameter groups
using independent sample t test. Tamoxifen resistance was
deﬁned as those patients treated with tamoxifen only in the
adjuvant setting who subsequently developed relapse or distant metastasis. Consistent with the observation in cell lines,
the BQ323636.1 expression level was signiﬁcantly higher in
tamoxifen resistant (TamR) patients than those who were
sensitive (TamS) to tamoxifen treatment (P ¼ 0.006; Fig.
4A). The BQ/WT ratio showed similar trend, though not
statistically signiﬁcant (Supplementary Table S3).
Consistently, in 37 patients who were ERþ and had received
tamoxifen treatment, higher BQ323636.1 expression level was
signiﬁcantly associated with development of distant metastasis (P ¼ 0.048; Fig. 4B). However, BQ323636.1 expression level
was not signiﬁcantly correlated with chest wall/breast relapse
(P ¼ 0.453; Supplementary Fig. S4). This might be due to limited
sample size, as among the 37 patients, there were only 27
patients whose relapse statuses were available.
Survival analysis was conducted to investigate the correlation between the variant's expression level and the clinical
outcomes of the patients with breast cancer. Among the 77
patients, 37 patients, who had received tamoxifen treatment,
were dichotomized by the BQ323636.1 expression level (cutoff

ZR75-1 and AK47 with vehicle (EtOH) treatment or 1 mmol/L tamoxifen

ZR75-1 and AK47 under 1 mmol/L tamoxifen treatment. The Western

was measured by MTT assay. When ZR-75-1 cells were overexpressing
BQ323636.1 or a vector control (B), the decrease in cell proliferation
observed under tamoxifen treatment was slower over a range of drug
concentrations in BQ323636.1-overexpressing cells compared with the

expression level was associated with both poorer overall survival
(P ¼ 0.041; Fig. 4C) and poorer disease-free survival (P ¼
0.008; Fig. 4D). This association remained signiﬁcant after being
adjusted by tumor size, tumor grade, HER2 and PR status of the
patients (Table 1), and analyzed by multivariate Cox regression
model (HR ¼ 11.8989; P ¼ 0.030 for overall survival; HR ¼ 10.764;
P ¼ 0.038 for disease-free survival; Table 2). Though there were
only 37 patients included, these signiﬁcant ﬁndings would
support the relevance of this variant in acquiring resistance
among patients who have received tamoxifen treatment.

BQ323636.1 modulates ERa transcriptional activation
activity
As tamoxifen directly targets ERa in breast cancer cells, we
next investigated whether BQ323636.1 modulates ERa transcription activation activity when ERa is bound by estrogen
(activated ERa) or tamoxifen (inactivated ERa).
Studies elucidating the role of NCOR2 on ERa transcription
activity have been conﬂicting depending on the luciferase
reporter used. Using the ERE-TK-Luc reporter, NCOR2 acted
as a corepressor for ERa-mediated transcription (21, 22),
whereas on the ERE-E1b-Luc reporter, it was shown that
NCOR2 was required for full ERa transcriptional activity
(20). We therefore used both luciferase reporters in turn to
test the modulation of BQ323636.1 on ERa-mediated transcription activation (Fig. 5).
When ERa was unliganded (treated with vehicle EtOH),
BQ323636.1 overexpression signiﬁcantly suppressed the
transcription on both ERE-E1b and ERE-TK promoters. On
E2 treatment, BQ323636.1 overexpression exhibited opposing
effects on luciferase activity between ERE-E1b and ERE-TK
promoters. On ERE-E1b promoter, overexpression of
BQ323636.1 induced signiﬁcant decrease in transcription
activity (Fig. 5A); whereas on ERE-TK promoter, signiﬁcant
increase in the transcription activity was seen (Fig. 5B). On the
basis of previous reports of NCOR2 functions on ERE transcription, that is, as a coactivator on ERE-E1b promoter and a
corepressor ERE-TK promoter, BQ323636.1 seems to exert the
opposite effect in modulating ERa transcriptional activation
activity compared with wild-type NCOR2.
In the presence of tamoxifen, regardless of whether E2 was
present, BQ323636.1 consistently exhibited suppression effect
on ERE transcription for both EREs. Overexpression of
BQ323636.1 decreased luciferase activity by 70% for ERE-E1b
promoter and by 50% for ERE-TK promoter. In conclusion,
BQ323636.1 was shown to be able to modulate the transcriptional activation activity of ERa, indicating its functional
importance in breast cancer.

Discussion
Our SpliceArray proﬁling identiﬁed a novel splice variant
BQ323636.1 of NCOR2 that had signiﬁcantly higher expression

tamoxifen-sensitive cell line ZR75-1, both at mRNA level and
protein level. In vitro, overexpression of the variant in tamoxifen-sensitive cell line ZR-75-1 induced its resistance to tamoxifen. In vivo, it consistently correlated with tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer samples. Higher expression of
BQ323636.1 was associated with tamoxifen resistance and,
consequently, poorer overall and disease-free survival. Higher
expression of BQ323636.1 was associated with negative ER and
PR status and metastasis; higher BQ323636.1 to wild-type ratio
was associated with de novo negative ER status, and triplenegative status — all features representing poor response to

breast cancer.
NCOR2, also commonly known as SMRT (the silencing
mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor),
was initially discovered as the suppressor for retinoic acid
and thyroid hormone receptors (23). As ERa is a critical
ligand-activated transcription factor in breast cells controlling multiple important cell signaling pathways, its transcription activation on its target genes is strictly regulated
by coactivators and corepressors. There are more than 23
corepressors of ERa identiﬁed that bind to different functional domains of ERa and suppress the activity of ERa

A Novel NCOR2 Variant Associated with Tamoxifen Resistance

through various mechanisms (24). NCOR2, together with its
homologous gene NCOR, are the best characterized corepressors for ERa and interact with ERa in the presence of
antagonist, that is, tamoxifen (25–27). When tamoxifen acts
as an antagonist in the cell context, it binds to ERa and
induces ERa to undergo conformational change that is more
favorable for the binding of corepressors rather than coactivators (28, 29), so as to suppress the transcriptional activation activity of ERa.
We therefore investigated whether BQ323636.1 also regulated ERa transcription activation activity by luciferase assay.
On E2 treatment, BQ323636.1 was observed to exhibit an
opposite effect in modulating ERa transcriptional activation
activity compared with wild-type NCOR2. For ERE-E1b promoter, on which NCOR2 was reported to act as a coactivator
when E2 was present (25, 30), overexpression of BQ323636.1
signiﬁcantly suppressed ERE-E1b transcription. For ERE-TK
promoter, on which NCOR2 was reported to be a corepressor
(22), overexpression of BQ323636.1 signiﬁcantly promoted
ERE-TK transcription. However, under tamoxifen treatment,
regardless of whether E2 was present, BQ323636.1 consistently
suppressed the transcription on both ERE-E1b and ERE-TK
promoters. Therefore, when ERa is liganded with E2, the effect
of NCOR2 and BQ323636.1 on its transcriptional activation
activity is promoter-speciﬁc. Regardless of whether NCOR2
wild-type acts as a coactivator or corepressor on the ERE
promoter, BQ323636.1 exerts an effect opposite to that of its
wild-type. However, once tamoxifen is applied, BQ323636.1

Splice variant BQ323636.1 skips exon 11 but retains the Nterminal 362 amino acids (42.6 kDa) of the NCOR2 wild-type
protein, corresponding to the ﬁrst repression domain RD-1
(Supplementary Fig. 6A). NCOR2 is a large protein (250 kDa)
with its N-terminus interacting with other transcriptional
corepressors to regulate transcription and its C-terminus
binding to nuclear receptors, that is, ERa (Supplementary Fig.
6B). At the N-terminus of NCOR2, amino acids 1–316 interact
with other transcription corepressors such as GPS2 (G protein
pathway suppressor 2; ref. 21) and TBLR1 (transducin b-like 1
X-linked receptor 1; ref. 31; Supplementary Fig. 6B). The 2 SANT
motifs, corresponding to amino acids 432–489 and amino acids
611–669, are critical components of a deacetylase activation
domain (DAD) that bind and activate HDAC3. The repression
domain RD-3 interacts with HDAC 4 and HDAC5, and the
repression domain RD-4 interacts with HDAC3, GPS2, and
TBLR1. As the SANT motifs important for NCOR2-HDAC3
interaction are missing in BQ323636.1 protein product, the
modulation of BQ323636.1 on ERa transcriptional activity may
not be through histone deacetylases (HDAC) but through the

interaction with other corepressors, possibly GPS2 or TBLR1.
The variant may compete with NCOR2 wild-type for binding to
these protein partners and thus inhibit the function of its wildtype to facilitate the development of tamoxifen resistance
(Supplementary Fig. S7). More comprehensive functional studies will be needed to elucidate the role of this variant in
tamoxifen resistance.
If BQ323636.1 is functionally important, its corresponding
amino acid sequence should be highly conserved among
different species. Indeed, the protein product of BQ323636.1
(highlighted by the frame in Supplementary Fig. 6C), was
the most conserved region in NCOR2 with above 90%
similarity across all 7 species. This implies that BQ323636.1
contains the most important functional domain in NCOR2
protein.
Very low mRNA expression level of BQ323636.1 compared
with the NCOR2 wild-type was observed in previous qPCR
results; however, in Western blot analysis, the protein level of
BQ323636.1 was rather high, similar, or even higher than its
wild-type form. Therefore, there may be some posttranscriptional mechanisms promoting the translation of BQ323636.1 or
protecting it from degradation. A phosphorylation site at
Ser2410 on NCOR2 has been reported to be the recognition

254

Cancer Res; 73(1) January 1, 2013

motif to export NCOR2 out of the nucleus for proteasomemediated degradation (32). This phosphorylation site is deleted in BQ323636.1, which may protect it from protein degradation, whereas the NCOR2 wild-type that contains the phosphorylation site is recognized to undergo protein degradation.
This may be a possible explanation for the relatively high
protein expression of BQ323636.1 observed in breast cancer
cell lines.
By revealing the clinical signiﬁcance and the underlying
function of BQ323636.1 in tamoxifen resistance and breast
tumor progression, splice variant BQ323636.1 may be developed as a potential prognostic biomarker for tamoxifen
treatment response and furthermore as a novel therapeutic
target to overcome tamoxifen resistance in clinical application. Tamoxifen resistance is a complex outcome involving
several mechanisms and pathways. It is unlikely that any
single gene or mechanism confers tamoxifen resistance. In
this study, we showed that alternatively spliced variants may
also play a critical role in tamoxifen resistance, which is an
important perspective that was neglected often in previous
tamoxifen resistance studies. By integrating splice variant
that is signiﬁcant in causing tamoxifen resistance with other
previous well-characterized targets, a combination set of
more effective therapeutic targets may be developed as a
novel therapy to overcome this clinical obstacle in breast
cancer.
