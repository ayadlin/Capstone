BACKGROUND: The current study was a phase 2 open–label study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of
single-agent sorafenib in the treatment of advanced HCC patients in a hepatitis B–endemic Asian population.
METHODS: Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) received sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg
twice daily in 4-week cycles. Tumor response was assessed every 3 cycles using Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors criteria. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were enrolled in the study and were treated with sorafenib for at least 12 weeks. The median age was 56 years (range, 28-79 years). Approximately 90% had hepatitis B virus–related HCC. Thirty-six (71%) patients had underlying Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, 13 (26%) Child-Pugh
B, and 2 (3%) Child-Pugh C. Four (8%) patients achieved partial responses, and 9 (18%) patients had stable
disease for at least 12 weeks. The median overall survival was 5 months (range, 4-17 months). Patients without
extrahepatic spread, particularly without lung metastasis (P<.01), are more likely to benefit from sorafenib
treatment. The most common toxicities were diarrhea (67%), malaise (55%), and hand-foot-skin reaction
(54%). The majority of patients had transient liver function derangement. Patients with and without underlying portal vein thrombosis had similar therapeutic benefits and likewise shared a similar treatment-related
toxicity profile with sorafenib treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent sorafenib demonstrates good efficacy
and acceptable tolerability in treating an advanced HCC patient population in a hepatitis B–endemic area.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide.1 There is great geographic heterogeneity in the incidence of HCC across the world, with the majority of cases found in Asian
countries because of the high prevalence of endemic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.1 Although the long-term

Phase 2 Study of Single-agent Sorafenib/Yau et al

survival of patients with early HCC amenable to surgical
treatment has improved in recent years, the prognosis of
patients with advanced HCC remains dismal. Therefore,
effective systemic therapies are urgently needed to
improve the survival of advanced HCC patients. HCC is
an aggressive, largely chemoresistant cancer with poor
prognosis. To our knowledge, there is no convincing evidence to date that systemic chemotherapy improves overall survival in advanced HCC patients.2 Single-agent
doxorubicin has been shown to produce a response rate of
approximately 10% to 15%, but with no proven survival
benefit.3 Because of the disappointing results of systemic
therapy for advanced HCC, researchers have shifted their
interests toward novel molecular-targeted agents.
Many molecular pathways play a pivotal role in the
development and growth of HCC.4 Promising results
have been shown in targeting the antiangiogenic pathways
and the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, blocks tumor
growth by its antiangiogenic properties and by targeting
tumor cell proliferation pathways, particularly the Raf/
MAPK/ERK pathway.5 In the pivotal phase 3 randomized trial of sorafenib treatment in patients with advanced
HCC conducted in Western patients,6 patients treated
with single-agent sorafenib were shown to have a 44%
increase in overall survival (OS) compared with placebo
(hazards ratio, 0.69; P ¼ .00058). However, in that study,
only patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis were included,
and very few (6%) of them had HBV-related HCC. Furthermore, most recruited patients had favorable clinical,
biochemical, or radiologic parameters. Moreover, the preliminary results of the phase 3 study conducted by Cheng
demonstrated an OS of 6.2 months in patients who
received single-agent sorafenib for the treatment of
advanced HCC in an Asian population.7 Nevertheless,
similar to the design of the Sorafenib HCC Assessment
Randomized Protocol Trial (SHARP) study,6 it only
included Child-Pugh A patients with favorable clinical parameters. However, in daily clinical practice in most Asian
countries, the patients with advanced HCC who are
encountered are HBV carriers with suboptimal liver function, often Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis. Even if they have
Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, there are often some adverse tumor factors, such as underlying portal vein thrombosis
(PVT). These patient populations are under-represented

in the SHARP and Asian trial, and the efficacy and tolerability of single-agent sorafenib in these ‘‘real practice’’
patients are largely unknown.
We conducted a single-arm, phase 2 open-label
study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of singleagent sorafenib in the treatment of advanced HCC
patients presenting at our center between November 2006
and January 2008.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This was a phase 2, open-label, single-arm study conducted at Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong
Kong. It was an investigator-initiated study and approved
by the local ethic committee. Written consent was
obtained from the patients before enrollment.
Patients’ Eligibility
The diagnosis of HCC was based on increased serum afetoprotein level >400 ng/mL and typical imaging
appearance according to the criteria of the European Association of Study of the Liver.8 Histology was only
obtained by either fine–needle aspiration or biopsy in the
case of diagnostic uncertainty.
Patients with advanced HCC who were not amenable to surgical resection, liver transplantation, or locoregional therapies were eligible to enter the current study.
However, they had to have measurable lesions by computed tomography (CT) scan.
Treatment Regimen and Disease
Assessment
All patients received single-agent sorafenib at a dose of 400
mg twice daily in 4-week cycles for at least 12 weeks.
Patients were observed regularly every 2 weeks when they
were receiving sorafenib. During the follow-up period after
they were discontinued from sorafenib, assessment was performed every 4 weeks. Disease assessment was performed
by CT scan approximately every 3 cycles (ie, 12 weeks).
Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography with choline-acetate as radioisotope were performed
in the case of diagnostic uncertainty. Response was determined by independent radiologists and classified according
to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria.9
429

Original Article

In this study, response was classified as complete response
(CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease. Patients who had achieved CR, PR, or SD
were defined as achieving clinical benefits. Only patients
who achieved clinical benefits continued sorafenib for
another 3 cycles until radiologic evidence of disease progression or unacceptable treatment toxicities.
Dose Modification
Dose modifications were required for drug-related toxicities. For grade 3 of 4 toxicities, sorafenib was withdrawn
until the toxicities improved to grade 2 or lower (grading
determined according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria). Afterward, sorafenib was reintroduced at a dose of 200 mg twice daily for 5 days and
escalated back to 400 mg twice daily if well tolerated. Otherwise, sorafenib was continued as 200 mg twice daily.
Endpoints
The primary endpoint of the study was OS and the secondary endpoints included progression-free survival
(PFS), tumor response rate, and drug tolerability.
Statistical Analysis
Survival analysis was computed by the Kaplan-Meier
method. PFS was calculated from the date of commencement of sorafenib to the date of documented progression
or death. OS was calculated from the date of commencement of sorafenib to the date of death or last follow-up.
Chi-square or Mann-Whitney U tests were used to
assess potential clinical factors that might predict clinical
benefit with sorafenib treatment. Potential predictive factors explored included age, sex, hepatitis B status, Eastern
Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status, ChildPugh group, presence of vascular invasion, presence of extrahepatic disease, presence of lung metastasis, and prior
systemic treatments.

demographic data of these patients. The median age was
56 years (range, 28-79 years), and 88% were men. The
majority of them had good performance status (95% had
an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, 5% had an
ECOG performance status of 2). Forty-six (90%) patients
were chronic hepatitis B carriers. In contrast, only 3 (6%)
patients were chronic hepatitis C carriers. Hepatitis C serology was not available in 3 patients. One patient was a
carrier of both hepatitis B and C viral infection. Thirty-six
(71%) patients had underlying Child-Pugh A cirrhosis,
13 (26%) patients had Child-Pugh B cirrhosis, and 2
(3%) had Child-Pugh C cirrhosis. All patients had
advanced HCC at the time of enrollment, and nearly half
of them had extrahepatic metastases. The lung was the
most common site of distant metastasis and was present in
20 (39%) patients, whereas PVT was present in
22 patients. Twelve patients had undergone prior liver
resection for HCC, and only 1 patient had undergone
liver transplantation. Four (8%) patients had received
prior systemic therapy for advanced HCC.
Treatment Efficacy
The median duration of sorafenib treatment was 3
months (range, 2.5-16 months), and 17 (33%) patients
had the dose reduced by half during the treatment cycles
because of treatment-related toxicities. Table 2 shows the
efficacy results of the study. The overall response rate was
8%. There were no CRs observed, 4 (8%) patients had
achieved PR, and another 9 (18%) patients had SD for at
least 3 months. Therefore, 13 (26%) patients derived clinical benefits from sorafenib treatment.
Survival Analysis
The overall median PFS and OS were 3 months (range, 317 months) and 5 months (range, 3-17 months), respecCancer

tively (Fig. 1). Of the 13 patients who had demonstrated
clinical benefits with sorafenib treatment, the median duration of treatment was 6 months (range, 3-16 months).
Their median PFS and OS were 6 months (range, 317 months) and 10 months (range, 4-17 months), respectively. There was no statistical significant difference in OS
between the responder and patients who had SD (13 vs
8 months; P ¼ .3). In contrast, with respect to the
38 patients who did not achieve clinical benefits with sorafenib, their median PFS and OS were 3 months and
5 months, respectively. Of note, there were significant differences in PFS (6 months vs 3 months; P ¼ .001) and
OS (10 months vs 5 months; P ¼ .006) between patients
who demonstrated clinical benefits with sorafenib and
patients who did not (Fig. 2).

Factors Predictive of Clinical Benefits With
Sorafenib
Table 3 lists the results of univariate analysis of potential
clinical factors predictive of clinical benefits with sorafenib treatment. Age, sex, ECOG performance status, hepatitis B carrier status, Child-Pugh group, invasion of major
vessels and no prior systemic treatment did not predict
clinical benefits with sorafenib. The absence of extrahepatic metastasis (P ¼ .045), in particular the absence of
lung metastasis (P<.01), significantly predicted clinical
benefits with sorafenib treatment.

Treatment-related Toxicities
Tables 4 and 5 show the details of treatment-related nonhematologic and hematologic toxicities, respectively, in
the patients. With regard to nonhematologic toxicities, diarrhea (67%) was the most commonly encountered toxicity, followed by malaise (55%) and hand-foot skin
reaction (HFSR) (54%). Moreover, the commonest grade
3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicities were diarrhea and
HFSR, which occurred in 20% and 16% of patients,
respectively. Hemorrhagic complications occurred in
3 patients, including epistaxis in 1 patient and upper gastrointestinal bleeding in 2 patients. With respect to hematological toxicities, thrombocytopenia (73%) was the
commonest toxicity and was also the most frequently
encountered grade 3 of 4 toxicity (10%). Table 6 shows
the details of derangement in biochemistry of the patients
on sorafenib. Notably, all patients except 1 had transient
liver function derangement. Aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) elevation was the most frequently affected liver biochemistry parameter and also the most common grade 3
toxicity, followed by bilirubin elevation. Grade 4 AST elevation was observed in 4% of patients, and grade 4 bilirubin elevation was observed in 6% of patients. In all these
patients with grade 4 liver toxicities, the liver function
gradually improved after sorafenib was discontinued.

Outcomes of Patients With PVT
Among 22 patients with PVT, there were 20 male and
only 2 female patients. The median age was 53 years
(range, 32-68 years). Seven patients had clinical benefits
with sorafenib; among them, 4 patients had PR, and the
other 3 patients demonstrated SD. Thus, 32% of patients
with PVT achieved clinical benefits with sorafenib treatment. There were no significant differences between

fairly good efficacy and acceptable tolerability in treating
advanced HCC patients in a hepatitis B–endemic area.

Original Article

The 8% response rate and 18% disease-stabilization rate
achieved in this study is encouraging and is comparable to
the results reported in the phase 2 study conducted by
Abou-Alfa et al10 and the phase 3 randomized controlled
trial (SHARP study).6 Although the disease-stabilization
rate of 35% is higher in the Asian study, this rate refers to
disease stabilization for more than 28 days, which is in
sharp contrast to the disease-stabilization rate of at least
3 months in the current study. Conversely, both PFS
(3 months) and OS (5 months) of patients in the current
study are apparently inferior to the survival reported in
the aforementioned phase 2 study conducted by AbouAlfa et al10 and the SHARP study.6 This is expected, as
the study population is different, and most patients enrolled in our study had poor overall prognosis because of
advanced tumors (such as PVT) or Child-Pugh B/C cirrhosis. Such patients were mostly excluded from the
SHARP and Asian studies.
In the SHARP study, 602 patients with biopsy-proven advanced HCC were recruited, and the median OS of
patients on sorafenib and placebo was 10.7 months and
7.9 months, respectively. Conversely, in the Asian study, a
total of 226 patients were recruited and randomized in a
2:1 fashion. The median OS of patients receiving sorafenib and placebo was 6.2 months and 4.1 months, respectively. In fact, the outcomes of patients in the Asian study
were worse than patients in the SHARP study because of
the enrollment of more patients with worse prognosis.
Notably, the study population in the current trial has even
poorer prognosis than the Asian study because the median
OS of this patient population in our historical cohort is
only 2.3 to 2.6 months.11 Impressively, the PFS of
3 months and OS of 5 months achieved in the current
study are still comparable with the findings of the Asian
study and are far better than our historical results.
More importantly, in patients who have achieved
clinical benefits with sorafenib, there was a 4-fold increase
in overall survival when compared with our historical
cohort. Interestingly, even in patients who did not demonstrate any clinical benefits with sorafenib, OS was substantially better compared with our historical cohort
results. It may suggest that even those patients who had no
demonstrable clinical benefits with sorafenib might have
some survival benefit from the treatment. This is an interesting phenomenon that has been observed recently in
using targeting agents in the treatment of other solid
434

tumors.12 With respect to patients with PVT, they did
derive similar benefits from sorafenib when compared
with patients without PVT. This finding further supports
the finding from the SHARP study9 that advanced HCC
patients with macrovascular invasion also benefit from
sorafenib treatment. Notably, the 5–month OS achieved
in patients with PVT in the current study is impressive,
because in the literature this patient population usually
has very short survival and grave prognosis.13
With regard to potential clinical or biological factors
for predicting the possibility of clinical benefits of sorafenib treatment, it has been shown that pretreatment tumor
phosphorylated ERK levels were correlated with time to
tumor progression in the phase 2 trial conducted by
Abou-Alfa et al.10 However, in patients with advanced
HCC amenable only to systemic therapy, tumor tissue is
generally not available. To our knowledge, no other clinical, biochemical, or radiologic parameters are available to
date to guide the use of sorafenib in patients with
advanced HCC. Interestingly, in the current study, we
have demonstrated that the presence of extrahepatic
involvement, in particular the presence of lung metastasis,
was significantly associated with no clinical benefit with
sorafenib treatment. This may be partly explained by the
finding that the presence of lung metastasis is a poor prognostic factor for advanced HCC patients.14 It signifies
high tumor load in advanced HCC patients that renders
the patients refractory to sorafenib treatment. This provocative finding implies that sorafenib suggests the best
therapeutic benefit in patients with locally advanced
HCC. However, this important finding needs to be further validated in future studies. The identification of clinical factors predictive of clinical benefits is of particular
importance in view of the high cost of sorafenib and
potential toxicities associated with sorafenib.
In the SHARP study, approximately 52% of
patients were reported to have grade 3 or 4 treatmentrelated toxicities, and the commonest adverse events were
diarrhea (39%) and HFSR (21%).6 Similarly, the most
commonly encountered toxicities in the present study
were also diarrhea (67%) and HFSR (54%). Notably,
there were higher incidences of malaise (55%), alopecia
(37%), and rashes (29%) associated with sorafenib treatment in our study cohort. Moreover, greater than half of
the patients encountered grade 1 or 2 hematologic toxicities. This might be partly attributed to the finding that
Cancer

most of the patients have some degree of pancytopenia
associated with underlying cirrhosis at baseline. Nevertheless, there was no grade 3 or 4 leukopenia associated with
sorafenib treatment in this study, and there was a far lower
incidence of neutropenia in patients treated with sorafenib
than in patients treated with single-agent doxorubicin or
combination chemotherapy.15
Compared with the results of the reported studies,6,16,17 there was a notably high incidence of liver function derangement in our present patient cohort. These
results were most likely related to a high proportion of
patients with suboptimal baseline liver function as a result
of more advanced cirrhosis in this study. The most common liver function derangement observed was the change
in transaminase levels. Overall, there were only few cases
of grade 4 liver dysfunctions, mainly in term of AST and
bilirubin levels. Nonetheless, the majority of the liver
derangements were transient and improved after stopping
sorafenib. In fact, the mechanism of sorafenib-induced
hepatotoxicity is still poorly elucidated and understood. It
may be partly accounted for by the inhibition of
UGT1A1 enzyme, which is responsible for hepatic bilirubin glucuronidation, by sorafenib.18 Furthermore, there
are recent reports regarding the reactivation of hepatitis B
infection in chronic hepatitis B carriers who received targeted therapy alone for the treatment of underlying malignancy.19,20 Thus, it is possible that the administration of
sorafenib will likewise lead to the reactivation of the
underlying hepatitis B infection and result in worsening
liver function, because most patients with advanced HCC
in Asia are chronic hepatitis B carriers. Therefore, in view
of these findings, vigilant liver function monitoring is advisable in patients with suboptimal baseline liver function
on sorafenib treatment.
Thus far, based on the SHARP study that recruited
mainly Child-Pugh A cirrhotic patients, sorafenib is only
recommended for treatment of advanced HCC patients
with underlying Child-Pugh A cirrhosis.21 However, in
the current study, we demonstrated that there was no significant difference in clinical benefits from sorafenib in
the treatment of Child-Pugh A or Child-Pugh B/C
patients. Moreover, the results of the current study demonstrated that Child-Pugh B/C patients were not associated with higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 treatmentrelated toxicities from sorafenib when compared with
Child-Pugh A patients. A recent retrospective subgroup

analysis study conducted by Abou-Alfa et al18 did demonstrate similar findings to our present study. However, in
that study, patients with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis fared
worse than those with Child-Pugh A, with more frequent
worsening of underlying cirrhosis. Therefore, more
mature results are needed from other ongoing studies
before generalized recommendation is made for sorafenib
use in Child-Pugh B or C patients.
The major limitation of the current study is its nonrandomized design, and we could only compare the
results with a historical cohort in our center. Moreover,
quality of life is not included as part of the assessment in
the current study. Nevertheless, the results from other
studies6,16 are only applicable to a highly selected ChildPugh A population with good favorable parameters. Our
results are more likely to reflect the results of ‘‘real life’’ situations in using sorafenib to treat advanced HCC patients
than the aforementioned studies.
In conclusion, to our knowledge this is the first
study in the literature that demonstrates good efficacy and
reasonable tolerability of sorafenib in treating an advanced
HCC patient subpopulation from a hepatitis B–endemic
Asian population. Moreover, in this study, we have demonstrated that the presence of lung metastasis predicts
poor response to sorafenib in advanced HCC patients.
