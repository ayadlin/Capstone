Abstract
Perifosine is an alkylphospholipid exhibiting antitumor activity as shown in both preclinical studies and clinical trials.
This activity is partly associated with its ability to inhibit Akt
activity. It has been shown that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis plays a critical role in regulation of
cell proliferation and survival primarily through functioning
both downstream and upstream of Akt. The current study
reveals a novel mechanism by which perifosine inhibits Akt
and the mTOR axis. In addition to inhibition of Akt, perifosine inhibited the assembly of both mTOR/raptor and
mTOR/rictor complexes. Strikingly, perifosine reduced the
levels of Akt and other major components including mTOR,
raptor, rictor, 70-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase, and 4E-binding
protein 1 in the mTOR axis by promoting their degradation
through a GSK3/FBW7-dependent mechanism. These results
thus suggest that perifosine inhibits the mTOR axis through
a different mechanism from inhibition of mTOR signaling by
classic mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin. Moreover, perifosine substantially increased the levels of type II light chain
3, a hallmark of autophagy, in addition to increasing poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, suggesting that perifosine
induces both apoptosis and autophagy. The combination of
perifosine with a lysosomal inhibitor enhanced apoptosis
and inhibited the growth of xenografts in nude mice, suggesting that perifosine-induced autophagy protects cells
from undergoing apoptosis. Collectively, we conclude that
perifosine inhibits mTOR signaling and induces autophagy,
highlighting a novel mechanism accounting for the anticancer activity of perifosine and a potential strategy to enhance
the anticancer efficacy of perifosine by preventing autophagy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(23):8967–76]

Introduction
Perifosine is an orally bioavailable alkylphospholipid exhibiting
antitumor activity in various preclinical models. Currently, perifosine is being tested in phase II clinical trials (1, 2) and has shown
single-agent partial responses in certain types of cancer such as

renal cell carcinoma (3, 4). In the preclinical settings, perifosine
in combination with other antitumor agents such as the PDK1 inhibitor, UCN-01 (5), histone deacetylase inhibitors (6), and the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide (7) show synergistic antitumor
effects.
Like other alkylphospholipids, perifosine targets cell membrane
and induces growth arrest and apoptosis (1, 8, 9). The mechanisms
by which perifosine exerts its antitumor effect have not been fully
elucidated, although it inhibits Akt (8, 10) and mitogen-activated
protein kinase activation (11) while inducing c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinase activation (11). Recent studies have shown that inhibition
of Akt at least partly accounts for the tumor-inhibitory activity
of perifosine (12, 13).
Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling is frequently activated
in various types of cancers and hence represents a major
cell survival pathway. Its activation has long been associated
with malignant transformation and apoptotic resistance (14, 15).
One well-known downstream signaling of phosphoinositide 3kinase/Akt is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (mTOR/raptor complex), which is phosphorylated (or
activated) in response to stimuli that activate the phosphoinositide
3-kinase/Akt pathway (16, 17). However, the recent discovery of the
mTOR/rictor complex as an Akt Ser473 kinase also places mTOR upstream of Akt (18).
mTOR, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase–related serine/theronine
kinase, plays a central role in regulating cell growth, proliferation,
and survival, partly by regulation of translation initiation,
through interactions with other proteins such as raptor (forming
mTOR complex 1, mTORC1) and rictor (forming mTOR complex
2, mTORC2; refs. 17, 19, 20). The best characterized downstream
effectors of mTORC1 are the 70-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase
(p70S6K) and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1; ref. 17). In response to mitogenic stimuli
or nutrient availability, mTOR/raptor complex is activated (21),
leading to phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 and the subsequent enhanced translation of mRNAs that are critical for cell
cycle progression and proliferation (e.g., c-Myc and cyclin D1;
ref. 17). Thus, mTOR signaling has emerged as an attractive cancer therapeutic target (17, 22). The potential applications of
mTOR inhibitors for treating various types of cancer have been
actively studied both preclinically and clinically. The most encouraging result from a recent clinical trial is that the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 improved overall survival among patients with
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (23).
Autophagy is a cellular lysosomal degradation pathway that is
essential for regulation of cells survival and death to maintain cellular homeostasis (24, 25). One of the key regulators of autophagy
is mTOR, which is the major inhibitory signal that shuts off autophagy in the presence of growth factors and abundant nutrients

(25). Accordingly, inhibition of mTOR signaling (e.g., by the mTOR
inhibitor rapamycin) induces autophagy (26).
We showed previously that perifosine decreases the levels of total Akt in some human lung cancer cell lines (12). The present
study followed up this interesting observation in a detailed way
and investigated whether perifosine also inhibits the mTOR axis
while inhibiting Akt signaling. We found that perifosine inhibited
both mTOR/raptor and mTOR/rictor complexes through a different mechanism from the classic mTOR inhibitor rapamycin by facilitating the degradation of the major components in the mTOR
axis, thus reveling a unique mechanism by which perifosine inhibits mTOR signaling. Correspondingly, we found that perifosine induced autophagy as well.

Materials and Methods
Reagent. Perifosine was supplied by Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, dissolved in PBS, and stored at −20°C. Rapamycin was purchased from LKT
Laboratories, dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mmol/L, and
stored at −80°C. Other chemicals including MG132, cycloheximide, LiCl,
SB216763, NH4Cl, and chloroquine were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Akt, mTOR, raptor, p-Akt (S473), p-Akt (T308), pp70S6K (T389), p70S6K, p-4E-BP1 (T37/46), 4E-BP1, and poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP), respectively, were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma.
Goat polyclonal mTOR (FRAP; N-19) and mouse monoclonal c-Myc
(9E10) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit
polyclonal rictor (BL2178) antibody was purchased from Bethyl Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal cyclin D1 antibody (clone DCS-6) was purchased
from Dako. Rabbit polyclonal microtubule-associated protein light chain
3 (LC3) antibody (NB100-2220) was purchased from Novus Biologicals.
Cell lines and cell culture. The human lung cancer cell lines used in
this study were described previously (27). HCT116-FBXW7+/+ and HCT116FBXW7−/− cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein (The Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine). These cell lines were grown in
monolayer culture in RPMI 1640 or McCoy's medium supplemented with
glutamine and 5% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
consisting of 5% CO2 and 95% air.
Cell survival assay. Cells were cultured in 96-well cell culture plates and
treated the next day with the agents indicated. Viable cell number was estimated using the sulforhodamine B assay as described previously (27).
Detection of apoptosis. Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V staining
using Annexin V-PE apoptosis detection kit purchased from BD Biosciences following the manufacturer's instructions. PARP cleavage was also
detected by Western blotting as an additional indicator of apoptosis.
Western blot analysis. Preparation of whole-cell protein lysates and
Western blot analysis were described previously (28, 29).
Immunoprecipitation. mTOR complexes or rictor were immunoprecipitated with goat polyclonal mTOR (FRAP; N-19) antibody or with rictor
antibody (Bethyl Laboratories) according to the same procedure described
previously (18, 30). At the end, the samples containing an equal amount
(20-50 μg) of whole-cell protein lysates and immunoprecipitates from 1
to 2 mg cell lysates captured with protein A-Sepharose were analyzed by
Western blotting.
Lung cancer xenografts and treatments. Animal experiments were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory
University. Five- to 6-week-old (∼20 g body weight) female athymic (nu/nu)
mice were ordered from Taconic and housed under pathogen-free conditions in microisolator cages with laboratory chow and water ad libitum.
H460 cells at 5 × 106 in serum-free medium were injected s.c. into the flank
region of nude mice. When tumors reached certain size ranges (∼300
mm3), the mice were randomized into four groups (n = 6 per group)
according to tumor volumes and body weights for the following treatments:
vehicle control, perifosine (15-10 mg/kg/d o.g.), chloroquine (50 mg/kg/d
i.p.), and the combination of chloroquine and perifosine. Tumor volumes
were measured using caliper measurements once every 2 days and calcu-

lated with the formula: V = π(length × width2) / 6. After a consecutive 14day treatment, the mice were sacrificed with CO2. The tumors were then
removed and weighed.
Statistical analysis. The statistical significance of differences in tumor
sizes or weights between two groups was analyzed with two-sided unpaired
Student's t tests when the variances were equal or with Welch's corrected
t test when the variances were not equal by use of GraphPad InStat 3 software. Data were examined as suggested by the same software to verify that
the assumptions for use of the t tests held. Results were considered to be
statistically significant at P < 0.05.

Results
Perifosine decreases the levels of p-Akt and total Akt and
inhibits mTOR complex assembly in human lung cancer cells.
In this study, we used four human lung cancer cell lines with different sensitivities to perifosine. The sensitivities of these cell lines
to perifosine are H460 > H358 > H157 > H226 (Fig. 1A). On treatment with perifosine, we detected a concentration-dependent decrease of p-Akt (S473) levels in these cell lines. As well, total Akt
levels were also decreased in perifosine-sensitive cell lines. The degrees of reduction in p-Akt (S473) and Akt levels in these cell lines
were tightly associated with cell sensitivities to perifosine (Fig. 1B).
For example, perifosine substantially decreased the levels of both
p-Akt (S473) and Akt in H460 cells, which are the most sensitive to
perifosine but only weakly reduced p-Akt (S473) levels in H226
cells, which are the most resistant to perifosine (Fig. 1B). The reduction of Akt levels occurred early within 2 h and was sustained
up to 16 h post perifosine treatment (Fig. 1C). We also detected the
effects of perifosine on Akt phosphorylation at T308 in these lung
cancer cell lines. Perifosine decreased Akt T308 phosphorylation in
H460 and H358 cell lines but not in H157 and H226 cell lines under
the tested conditions (see Supplementary Fig. S1). It seems that
Akt S473 site is more susceptible than Akt T308 site to inhibition
by perifosine. Nonetheless, these results indicate that perifosine
not only inhibits Akt phosphorylation but also decreases the levels
of total Akt in human lung cancer cells.
Given that mTOR can function both downstream and upstream
of Akt and mTOR/rictor acts as an Akt Ser473 kinase (18), we next
examined whether perifosine affects the assembly of mTOR complexes. To this end, we immunoprecipitated mTOR complexes with
mTOR antibody from cell lysates exposed to perifosine or rapamycin, which is known to inhibit mTOR complexes (30, 31), and then
detected individual components in the precipitates by Western
blot analysis. In H157 cells, we detected less amounts of both raptor and rictor in the immunoprecipitates from cell lysates treated
with either perifosine or rapamycin compared with control cell lysates, indicating that perifosine inhibited assembly of both mTOR/
raptor and mTOR/rictor complexes. In H460 cells, we observed
similar results. Additionally, we detected decreased levels of mTOR
in the immunoprecipitate exposed to perifosine as well. Interestingly, we did not find alterations of either mTOR or raptor levels
in whole protein lysates from perifosine-treated H157 cells; however, both mTOR and raptor levels were deceased in whole protein
lysates from perifosine-treated H460 cells. In whole-cell lysates
from both H157 and H460 cells treated with perifosine, rictor levels
were reduced (Fig. 1D). These results clearly indicate that perifosine inhibits the assembly of both mTOR/raptor and mTOR/rictor
complexes possibly though decreasing the levels of mTOR, raptor,
and/or rictor in some cell lines.
Perifosine decreases the levels of major proteins in the
mTOR axis in human lung cancer cells. Given that perifosine

Perifosine Inhibition of mTOR Signaling

Figure 1. Perifosine inhibits Akt (B and C) and assembly of mTOR complexes (D) in human lung cancer cell lines with different sensitivities to perifosine (A). A, indicated
cell lines were treated with different concentrations of perifosine (PRFS) ranging from 1 to 20 μmol/L. After 24 h, cells were subjected to sulforhodamine B assay
for estimating the viable cells. B and C, indicated cell lines were treated with the increased concentrations of perifosine (0-15 μmol/L) for 8 h (B) or with 5 μmol/L
perifosine for the given times. Cells were then subjected to preparation of whole-cell protein lysates and subsequent Western blot analysis. D, indicated cell lines were
treated with solvent control (Ctrl), 10 μmol/L perifosine, or 10 nmol/L rapamycin (Rap). After 6 h, cells were harvested for preparation of whole-cell protein lysates
and subsequent immunoprecipitation with mTOR antibody. The indicated proteins were detected with Western blotting.

decreased the levels of mTOR, raptor, and rictor in H460 cells during the immunoprecipitation-Western blotting analysis as presented above, we then questioned whether these alterations
occurs commonly in human lung cancer cell lines. Thus, we treated
the four lung cancer cell lines with different sensitivities to perifosine with different concentrations of perifosine for 8 h and then
detected the levels of several key proteins including their phosphorylation in the mTOR axis. As presented in Fig. 2A, the levels
of mTOR, p-mTOR, raptor, rictor, p70S6K, p-p70S6K, 4E-BP1, and

p-4E-BP1 were decreased in H460, H358, and H157 cells but were
either not or only minimally reduced in H226 cells. It appeared that
the degrees of reduction of these proteins were tightly associated
with cell sensitivities to perifosine. Like Akt, the reduction of
mTOR, raptor, and rictor occurred early at 2 h post-perifosine
treatment in H460 cells; however, these reductions happened relatively late at either 8 or 16 h after perifosine treatment in H157
cells (Fig. 2B). Collectively, perifosine decreased the levels of multiple key proteins in the mTOR axis in human lung cancer cells.

Perifosine Inhibition of mTOR Signaling

The degrees of reduction of these proteins in different cell lines are
tightly associated with cell sensitivities to perifosine.
By further conducting a short kinetic analysis of reduction in
p-Akt, Akt, mTOR, raptor, and rictor, we found that p-Akt reduction
occurred at 15 min post-perifosine treatment, whereas the reduction of Akt, mTOR, raptor, and rictor happened at 30 min or even
later after perifosine treatment (Fig. 2C), suggesting that inhibition
of p-Akt precedes reduction of Akt, mTOR, raptor, and rictor.
Because perifosine inhibits the mTOR axis, we further examined
the effects of perifosine on modulation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc, two
oncogenic proteins known to be regulated by mTOR signaling (32).
As presented in Fig. 2A, cyclin D1 levels were decreased in H460,
H358, and H157 cells but not in H226 cells on treatment with perifosine. c-Myc levels were decreased in all of these four cell lines
when exposed to perifosine. As well, the reduction degrees of both
cyclin D1 and c-Myc by perifosine in these cell lines were associated with cell sensitivities to perifosine. For example, perifosine decreased the levels of both proteins to the lowest in H460 cells but
only weakly or minimally in H226 cells.
Perifosine decreases the levels of Akt and mTOR axis proteins through promoting their degradation. It was recently reported that some proteins including mTOR, raptor, and p70S6K
can be regulated through proteasome-mediated protein degradation (33, 34). Therefore, we reasoned whether perifosine induces
degradation of these proteins. Thus, we treated both H460 and
H358 cells with perifosine in the absence and presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and then detected the levels of some key
proteins in the mTOR axis. As shown in Fig. 3A, perifosine decreased the levels of Akt, mTOR, raptor, and rictor in both cell
lines as presented above. The presence of MG132 could prevent
these proteins from reduction by perifosine, suggesting that perifosine decreases the levels of these proteins through facilitating
proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Moreover, we determined whether perifosine increased ubiquitination of these
proteins using rictor as an example. By Western blotting, we detected the highest levels of ubiquitinated proteins in the whole protein lysates from cells exposed to perifosine and MG132 compared
with others treated with solvent, perifosine, or MG132 alone
(Fig. 3B), suggesting that perifosine increases protein ubiquitination. By immunoprecipitation-Western blotting, we specifically detected rictor ubiquitination in cells exposed to perifosine. Similar to
what we observed in whole protein lysates, the highest levels of ubiquitinated rictor were detected in cells exposed to perfosine combined with MG132 in comparison with cells treated with perifosine
or MG132 alone (Fig. 3B). These results together suggest that perfosine induces ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of proteins such as rictor in the mTOR axis.
Additionally, we performed cycloheximide chase assay to determine whether perifosine decreases the stability of mTOR, raptor,
rictor, and Akt. As presented in Fig. 3C, the levels of these proteins
in PBS control cells were not reduced within the tested time ranges
but were substantially decreased as the time increased postaddition of cycloheximide in perifosine-treated cells. The half-lives
of these proteins in perifosine-treated cells were <60 min (mTOR,
raptor, and rictor) or <90 min (Akt). Thus, it is clear that perifosine
decreases the stability of these proteins, further supporting the
conclusion that perifosine facilitates the degradation of some key
proteins in the mTOR axis.
Perifosine induces the degradation of key proteins in the
mTOR axis through a GSK3/FBXW7-dependent mechanism.
It has been recently shown that mTOR can undergo FBXW7-

www.aacrjournals.org

dependent, proteasome-mediated degradation. We thus asked
whether FBWX7 is involved in perifosine-induced degradation of
mTOR and its associated proteins. To this end, we took advantage
of paired isogenic HCT116 cell lines, in one of which FBXW7 is genetically knocked out (35). We compared the effects of perifosine
on the degradation of several key component in the mTOR axis
between HCT116-FBXW7+/+ and HCT116-FBXW7−/− cell lines. As
shown in Fig. 4A, perifosine decreased the levels of mTOR, raptor,
rictor, and Akt in a concentration-dependent manner in HCT116FBXW7+/+ cells but not in HCT116-FBXW7−/− cells, indicating that
perifosine induces a FBXW7-dependent degradation of some key
proteins in the mTOR axis. Given that GSK3 is often involved in
phosphorylation of the substrates of FBXW7, an essential step
for FBXW7-mediated protein ubiquitination and degradation
(36), we next questioned whether GSK3 is involved in perifosineinduced, FBXW7-dependent degradation of proteins in the mTOR
axis. As presented in Fig. 4B, perifosine decreased the levels of
mTOR, raptor, rictor, and Akt in H460 cells as shown above; however, it failed to do so in the presence of the GSK3 inhibitor, LiCl,
or SB216763. These data indicate that perifosine-induced degradation of the proteins in the mTOR axis is GSK3-dependent. Collectively, we conclude that perifosine induces degradation of some
key proteins in the mTOR axis through a GSK3/FBXW7-dependent
mechanism.
Perifosine induces autophagy in human lung cancer cells.
Our above findings clearly show that perifosine inhibits mTOR signaling. Given that mTOR signaling is critical for regulation of autophagy (25), we next determined whether perifosine induces
autophagy. In this study, we detected the levels of LC3-II for monitoring autophagy because it is essential for formation of autophagosome and has been widely used for estimating the abundance of
the autophagosome or autophagy (37). As presented in Fig. 5A,
perifosine potently increased the levels of LC3-II in perifosinesensitive cell lines (e.g., H460 and H358) but weakly or minimally
in the perifosine-resistant cell lines (e.g., H226). The potency of
perifosine in inducing LC3-II in these cell lines was H460 > H358
> H157 > H226. We noted that both H157 and H226 have higher
basal levels of LC3-II than H460 and H358 cells. Depending on
the cell lines, perifosine-induced increase in LC3-II could occur
at 2 h (H460 cells) or after 4 h (H157) and could be sustained up
to 24 h in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). Because LC3-II itself
is degraded by autophagy and its increase is due to the accumulation of the autophagosome by blockage of autophagic degradation
(37), we further determined whether perifosine indeed induces
autophagic flux. To this end, we compared the modulatory effects
of perifosine on LC3-II levels in the absence and presence of the
lysosomal protease inhibitor NH 4Cl as recommended (37). As
shown in Fig. 5C, the presence of NH4Cl, which blocks autophagic
degradation, further increased the levels of LC3-II compared with
those in cells exposed to perifosine alone, indicating that perifosine
indeed induces autophagic flux. Collectively, we conclude that
perifosine induces autophagy.
Moreover, we detected PARP cleavage as an indication of
apoptosis in the same cell lines exposed to perifosine. As reported
previously (12), perifosine induced PARP cleavage in perifosinesensitive cells (e.g., H460) but not in perifosine-resistant cell lines
(e.g., H226). PARP cleavage was detected and accompanied with an
increase in LC3-II (Fig. 5A and B). These results indicate that perifosine induces autophagy while triggering apoptosis.
Inhibition of autophagy enhances the apoptosis-inducing
activity and anticancer efficacy of perifosine. Autophagy plays

addition, the same lysates were also subjected

a critical role in regulation of cell survival or death (38). To
determine whether induction of autophagy by perifosine is a survival or death mechanism, we looked at the effects of perifosine
on cell survival and apoptosis in the presence of a lysosomal
protease inhibitor in several human lung cancer cells. As shown
in Fig. 6A (top), the combination of perifosine with either NH4Cl
or chloroquine was more effective than perifosine alone in decreasing the survival of H157 cells. Similar results were generated
in H358 and H226 cell lines as well (data not shown). In agreement, the combination of perifosine with NH4Cl or chloroquine
was also more potent than perifosine alone in inducing apoptosis
evidenced by increased Annexin V–positive (e.g., apoptotic) cells
(Fig. 6A, middle) and PARP cleavage (Fig. 6A, bottom). As
we observed in Fig. 5C, the presence of either NH4Cl or chloroquine further increased LC3-II levels (Fig. 6A, bottom). These data

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (23). December 1, 2009

indicate that perifosine-induced autophagy represents a prosurvival
mechanism, the inhibition of which drives more cells to die of
apoptosis.
We next tested whether inhibition of autophagy enhances the
anticancer activity of perifosine in vivo. Given that H157 cells do
not form colonies on soft agar (American Type Culture Collection
data sheet) and do not grow well as a xenograft in mice,1 we tested
the in vivo effect of perifosine combined with autophage inhibition
in H460 xenografts, an aggressive tumor model. Before the experiment, we confirmed the effect of perifosine combined with chloroquine on the growth of H460 cells in cell cultures. In agreement
with findings in H157 cells, the combination of perifosine and

for involvement of FBXW7 and GSK3 in
perifosine-induced degradation of several
proteins in the mTOR axis. Perifosine
inhibits Akt, resulting in GSK3 activation,
which phosphorylates mTOR and facilitates
ubiquitination and degradation of mTOR by
FBWX7. As a consequence, mTOR
complexes will be destabilized and proteins
associated with these complexes will be
degraded.

chloroquine was more effective than perifosine alone in decreasing
the survival of H460 cells (Fig. 6B, top). In the H460 xenograft
model, treatment with the perifosine and chloroquine combination
significantly (P < 0.05) decreased both tumor size (Fig. 6B, middle)
and tumor weight (Fig. 6B, bottom) compared with vehicle control
treatment. Perifosine alone treatment showed a trend to decrease
tumor size and weight but did not achieve statistical significance
under the tested schedule (Fig. 6B, middle and bottom). These data

thus provide in vivo evidence for enhancement of the anticancer
efficacy of perifosine by preventing autophagy.

Discussion
Our previous study has shown that perifosine inhibits Akt
in human lung cancer cells; this event contributes in part to
perifosine-induced apoptosis (12). In the current study, we further

show that perifosine not only inhibited Akt phosphorylation but also
decreased the levels of total Akt in perifosine-sensitive cell lines,
which appears to be an early event because we could detect Akt
reduction even at 15 min post-perifosine treatment (Figs. 1 and
2). Given that perifosine decreased the levels of p-Akt (S473) more
profoundly than total Akt levels in some cell lines (e.g., H226 and
H157), we believe that perifosine inhibit Akt through both suppressing Akt phosphorylation and reducing total Akt levels at least in
our cell systems. It has recently been shown that mTOR/rictor

complex functions as an Akt Ser473 kinase (18). In this study, we
found that perifosine clearly inhibited the assembly of not only
mTOR/rictor but also mTOR/raptor as rapamycin did (Fig. 1).
Thus, it is possible that perifosine inhibits mTOR/rictor, resulting
in further inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. In this study, we also
observe that perifosine decreased the levels of c-Myc and cyclin D1
likely due to inhibition of mTOR/raptor signaling because these
two proteins are well known to be regulated by mTOR/raptor
signaling (32).

Perifosine Inhibition of mTOR Signaling

The intriguing novel finding in this study is that perifosine
decreases the levels of several key components in the mTOR
axis including mTOR, rictor, raptor, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1 through
promoting ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated protein degradation
based on the following lines of evidence: (a) Perifosine decreased
the levels of mTOR, rictor, raptor, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1. The
activity of perifosine on reducing the levels of these proteins is
decreased as the sensitivities of the tested cell lines to perifosine
drops (Fig. 2). (b) The presence of the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 prevented perifosine-induced reduction of mTOR, raptor,
and rictor as well as Akt (Fig. 3A). (c) Perifosine increases protein
ubiquitination because we detected the highest levels of ubiquitinated proteins in whole-cell protein lysates exposed to perifosine
in the presence of MG132 and the highest levels of ubiquitinated
rictor from the same lysate (Fig. 3B). (d) Perifosine decreases the
stability of mTOR, raptor, rictor, and Akt because perifosine shortened the half-lives of these proteins in the cycloheximide chase
assay (Fig. 3C). Therefore, it appears that perifosine inhibits mTOR
axis through destroying the major components in the mTOR axis;
such a mechanism is obviously different from that by which rapamycin inhibits mTOR signaling. Although it has been described in
some studies that perifosine inhibits mTOR signaling (e.g., inhibition of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation; refs. 13, 39), our
study is the first to show that perifosine induces degradation of
the major components in the mTOR axis, leading to inhibition of
the mTOR axis.
The remaining question is how perifosine is able to simultaneously induce degradation of a group of key proteins in the mTOR
axis. A recent study has shown that mTOR can be degraded
through a FBXW7-dependent mechanism (33). In our study, we
have shown that perifosine induced degradation of mTOR, raptor,
rictor, and Akt is FBXW7-dependent because deficiency in FBXW7
prevents the degradation of these proteins by perifosine (Fig. 4A).
Moreover, we have shown that perifosine-induced degradation of
mTOR, raptor, rictor, and Akt is also GSK3-dependent because the
presence of the GSK3 inhibitor (e.g., LiCl or SB216763) abolished
the ability of perifosine to reduce the levels of these proteins
(Fig. 4B). Collectively, we conclude that perifosine induces the
degradation of several key proteins in the mTOR axis through a
GSK3-dependent and FBXW7-mediated mechanism. Given that
the majority of FBXW7 substrates are phosphorylated by GSK3
(36), our findings also warrant further study on the role of GSK3
in FBXW7-mediated mTOR degradation.
Because these proteins are tightly associated with mTOR, it is
possible that the individual proteins in the mTOR complexes
will be stabilized and induction of one or two key components
in the complexes may result in simultaneous degradation of
other components in the complexes. Indeed, mTOR and raptor
have been shown to stabilize each other in the complex (40).
Our data clearly show that inhibition of Akt phosphorylation
occurs before the reduction of mTOR, raptor, rictor, and Akt
(Fig. 2C). Given that FBXW7 is the E3 ubiquitin E3 ligase that
is responsible for mTOR degradation (33), it is likely that Akt
inhibition by perifosine causes GSK3 activation (dephosphorylation) as we have shown previously (12), which in turn phosphorylates mTOR and triggers FBXW7-mediated degradation of mTOR.
As a consequence, other proteins such as raptor, rictor, and Akt
that are tightly associated with mTOR are degraded as well
(Fig. 4C). Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that some
of these proteins are also directly subjected to FBXW7-mediated
degradation because perifosine increased rictor ubiquitination in

our study. Nonetheless, our findings warrant further investigation
in these directions.
Interestingly, a recent study reported a similar phenomena that
activation of forkhead box protein O1 in mouse myoblasts results
in degradation of several mTOR pathway components including
mTOR, raptor, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1 (34). It is well known that forkhead box protein O1 is a transcriptional factor known to be phosphorylated or inhibited by Akt (41). We showed previously that
perifosine inhibits Akt as well as GSK3 and forkhead box protein
O1 phosphorylation in these lung cancer cell lines (e.g., H157 and
H460; ref. 12). Thus, whether perifosine inhibits Akt, leading to
forkhead box protein O1 activation (dephosphorylation), which
in turn triggers the degradation of some key proteins in the mTOR
axis, needs further investigation as well.
Given the critical role of mTOR signaling in regulation of autophagy, it may not be surprising to find that perifosine induces
autophagy evidenced by increased levels of LC3-II in cells, particularly those sensitive to perifosine, when exposed to perifosine
(Fig. 5). Our current and previous (12) studies have shown that
perifosine induces apoptosis in these lung cancer cells. Thus, it
is clear that perifosine induces autophagy while inducing apoptosis. We noted that the abilities of perifosine to induce both apoptosis and autophagy are positively associated with increased cell
sensitivities to perifosine. However, the basal levels of LC3-II in
perifosine-resistant cells (e.g., H226) were higher than those in
perifosine-sensitive cells (e.g., H460) and minimally increased by
perifosine. Because autophagy can be either a prosurvival or a
death mechanism depending on the circumstances (24, 25), the intriguing question for us is whether induction of autophagy by perifosine in our cell systems is a death or survival mechanism. In our
study, the presence of the lysosomal protease inhibitors such as
chloroquine and NH4Cl enhanced the ability of perifosine to decrease cell number and increase apoptosis (Fig. 6). Moreover,
the combination of perifosine and chloroquine was more potent
than perifosine alone in inhibiting the growth of lung cancer xenografts in mice (Fig. 6). Collectively, these results indicate that autophagy is more likely a prosurvival mechanism that protects cells
from perifosine-mediated apoptosis. Accordingly, inhibition of autophagy with a lysosomal protease inhibitor such as chloroquine
potentiates the apoptosis-inducing and anticancer activities of
perifosine. Thus, our findings in this study may suggest a strategy
in the clinic to enhance the anticancer efficacy of perifosine by
combining perifosine with an autophagic inhibitor particularly
when single-agent activity of perifosine in many common solid
tumors was not encouraging (3).
