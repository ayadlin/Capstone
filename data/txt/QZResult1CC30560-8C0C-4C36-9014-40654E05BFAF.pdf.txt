Abstract
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a nonreceptor protein tyrosine
kinase and key modulator of integrin signaling, is widely
expressed in different tissues and cell types. Recent evidence
indicates a central function of FAK in neoplasia where the
kinase contributes to cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis
and anoikis, invasiveness, and metastasis. FAK, like other
signaling kinases, is dependent on the chaperone heat shock
protein 90 (Hsp90) for its stability and proper function. Thus,
inhibition of Hsp90 might be a way of disrupting FAK
signaling and, consequently, tumor progression. FAK is
expressed in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions
and metastatic cervical carcinomas but not in nonneoplastic
cervical mucosa. In SiHa, a cervical cancer cell line with
characteristics of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the
stable expression of dominant-negative FAK-related nonkinase decreases anchorage independence and delays xenograft growth. FAK-related nonkinase as well as the Hsp90
inhibitor 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin both negatively interfere with FAK signaling and
focal adhesion turnover. Short-term 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin treatment prolongs survival
in a SiHa lung metastasis model and chronic administration
suppresses tumor growth as well as metastatic spread in
orthotopic xenografts. Taken together, our data suggest that
FAK is of importance for tumor progression in cervical cancer
and that disruption of FAK signaling by Hsp90 inhibition
might be an avenue to restrain tumor growth as well as
metastatic spread. [Cancer Res 2009;69(11):4750–9]

Introduction
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a nonreceptor protein tyrosine
kinase involved in integrin signaling, fulfills complex biological
tasks that require its kinase activity as well as its scaffolding
function (1). Recent reports highlight the significance of FAK in
neoplasia where it has been implicated in cell proliferation,
protection from apoptosis and anoikis, migration, invasion, cell
spreading, adhesion, and angiogenesis, thereby influencing each
step of the metastatic cascade (2). This functional diversity and the

finding that FAK is overexpressed in different tumors have led to an
increasing interest in the integrin-FAK-Src signaling complex as
potential target for therapeutic intervention (3–5). The expression
of the COOH-terminal, noncatalytic domain of FAK, termed FAKrelated nonkinase (FRNK) (ref. 6), has been instrumental for the
exploration of the cellular functions of the kinase as well as the
therapeutic potential of FAK inhibition.
Notably, not only Src but also FAK has been described as ‘‘client’’
of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), which is responsible for
maintaining the functional conformation of a range of signaling
kinases (7). Hsp90 is abundant and active intracellularly as a
flexible dimer. Each monomer consists of an ATPase containing Ndomain, which is connected to the M-domain by a flexible, charged
linker and followed by the COOH-terminal dimerization domain.
Substrate specificity and chaperone function are regulated by an
array of cofactors, and an increased activity of the entire complex
in cancer cells has been held responsible for the relative tumor
specificity of Hsp90 inhibitors (8). The uniqueness of the NH2terminal ATP-binding pocket is the structural cause for the binding
of benzoquinone ansamycins, which mimic the kinked conformation of ATP inside this pocket (9). Geldanamycin was the first
compound of this group and initially recognized for its cytotoxicity
and ability to revert the phenotype of v-Src-transformed cells (10).
Because of instability and hepatotoxicity, semisynthetic derivatives
were developed. 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin and
the water-soluble 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) have entered clinical trials. 17-Allylamino17-demethoxygeldanamycin is most advanced in clinical testing
and encouraging results have been reported (11–13). Efforts are
currently directed toward the development of fully synthetic Hsp90
inhibitors with improved solubility and side effect profile (14) and
toward resolving problems associated with resistance mechanisms
such as the heat shock response (15).
Recent studies have shown that Hsp90 contributes to cell
migration and, in malignancies, to tumor progression (16, 17).
These studies focused mainly on the secreted Hsp90a isoform.
However, Hsp90 also maintains the stability of intracellular kinases
in charge of cell motility. Thus, inhibitors of Hsp90 should suppress
not only tumor growth but also invasion and metastasis. Although
cancer of the uterine cervix can be detected at early stages through
screening, therapeutic options for metastatic disease are currently
limited to cisplatin and radiation (18). In this study, we provide a
rationale for FAK targeting in cervical cancer. Using stable
FRNK expression as a model, we show that interference with
FAK signaling decreases tumor growth and metastatic colonization. Importantly, we provide evidence that pharmacologic
inhibition of Hsp90 leads to decreased FAK signaling and,

consequently, displays growth-inhibitory and antimetastatic effects
similar to FAK inhibition alone.

Materials and Methods
Patient tissue and histology. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissues of 20 cases each of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion
(HGSIL) and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the uterine
cervix with one paired lymph node metastasis were selected from files of
the Institute of Pathology Leipzig (1997-2007). Ethics approval was obtained
from institutional committees at the University of Leipzig (protocol
037-2007) and the University Health Network (protocol 06-0804-T).
Histology was examined by a senior pathologist (L-C.H.) and a pathologist-in-training (J.S.). Eighteen HGSIL, 20 SCC, and 18 metastasis contained
sufficient tissue for scoring. Nonneoplastic epithelium was present in
5 HGSIL and 11 SCC. Immunohistochemistry was scored for intensity
(0-3; Supplementary Fig. S1) and percent area was estimated for each
intensity level. Both values were multiplied to give a histology score
(H-score: 0-300).
Reagents, cells, and viruses. Geldanamycin (Biomol) was dissolved in
DMSO at 10 mmol/L and stored at -20jC. 17-DMAG (NSC707545) was
supplied by the National Cancer Institute, stored at -20jC, and dissolved in
water or saline before use. SiHa and ME180 cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection and cultured as recommended. DsRed2
fluorescently labeled SiHa cells were obtained from Dr. R.P. Hill (University
of Toronto). Absence of Mycoplasma was confirmed using Hoechst
33342 staining (Sigma-Aldrich) and MycoAlert Detection kit (Lonza). FRNK
cDNA, a gift from Dr. M.D. Schaller (University of North Carolina), was
subcloned into a retroviral vector (pBMN-I-GFP; Addgene plasmid 1736;
http://www.stanford.edu/group/nolan/plasmid_maps/pmaps.html) and
stable cell lines were generated using an amphotrophic Phoenix-MMULV
system provided by Dr. G.P. Nolan (Stanford University). Vector-control cells
were generated using the empty construct. GFP-expressing cells were
isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting resulting in a f98% enriched
population. FRNK expression was monitored by reverse transcription-PCR
and immunoblotting. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen) and reverse transcribed with SuperScript II (Invitrogen). An
equivalent of 10 ng cDNA, SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems),
and the Mx3000P PCR system (Stratagene) were used to amplify FRNK and
RPL15 housekeeping control. For primer sequences, see Supplementary
Information.
In vitro assays. Migration and invasion were assessed as described (19).
Human fibronectin (5 Ag/mL; BD Biosciences) or epidermal growth factor
(50 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) served as chemoattractants. Cells were used
after 4 h serum withdrawal. 17-DMAG was added into the bottom chamber
for up to 24 h. Cells on the opposite filter surface were stained with DiffQuik (Dade Behring) and counted at 250 magnification in one random
field/quadrant (migration) or the entire filter (invasion). Colony formation
was tested with 100 and 250 cells per 10 cm dish (triplicates). Colony
number and size were determined after 3 weeks. Anchorage-independent
growth was tested in soft agar, and 2 a-MEM was mixed with select agar
(Invitrogen) to form a 1% (w/v) base and a 0.4% top layer in 6-well plates.
Cells (1  104) were embedded into the top layer. Cultures were stained
with neutral red (Sigma-Aldrich) after 3 weeks and images were taken using
a Leica MZFLIII stereomicroscope. Colony number and size were
determined using Image Pro 3D Analyzer version 6.3.0.512 (Media
Cybernetics).
Immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was done as described (20). Nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were probed with the
antibodies listed in Supplementary Information. Signal detection after
secondary antibody incubation (GE Healthcare/Amersham) was done with
SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce). Signal quantification was done using (a)
Typhoon 9410 (GE Healthcare) with ECL Plus and Image Quant 5.2 software
or (b) Odyssey Infrared System (LI-COR Biosciences) with IRDye800
antibodies (Rockland).
Immunohistochemistry. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin, paraffin embedded, and processed as 4 Am sections. Mouse lungs

were in situ formalin-instilled before dissection. Archival patient tissue was
processed alongside SiHa and ME180 xenograft sections for internal control.
After microwave antigen retrieval in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0;
10 min), antibodies were incubated overnight. For antibodies and dilutions,
see Supplementary Information. Image analysis was done with in-house
image analysis tools based on IDL 6.3 as described (21).
Immunofluorescence. Cells were grown for 24 to 48 h on type I collagen
(100 Ag/mL; BD Biosciences)-coated coverslips before drug exposure for
24 h. After fixation with 4% formalin and permeabilization with 0.1% (v/v)
Triton X-100, primary antibodies in 1% (v/v) bovine serum albumin/PBS
were incubated for 1 h. For antibodies and dilutions, see Supplementary
Information. Clone 77/FAK used for immunofluorescence was generated
with an immunogen not overlapping with FRNK (amino acids 354-533).
Secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 555 was incubated
together with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin for 30 min and coverslips were
mounted with ProLong Gold containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(Invitrogen). Confocal images were acquired using an Olympus IX81
microscope and Fluoview FV1000 software.
Animal xenografts. Female SCID mice aged 6 to 12 weeks were bred and
housed at the Ontario Cancer Institute animal facility. Experiments were
done according to regulations of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.
Subcutaneous and orthotopic cervical xenografts were done as described
(20, 22). To determine a limited dose-response relationship, orthotopic
xenografts were established over 4 weeks and treated with four doses of 10
or 30 mg/kg 17-DMAG at 12 h intervals. Mice were killed and tumors were
sampled 4 h after the last treatment. For chronic administration, 17-DMAG
was given by intraperitoneal injection three times a week at 25 mg/kg as
described (23) starting 4 h after implantation. Controls received saline. Mice
were killed when control tumors approached f1 cm diameter. Tumors
were removed and remaining organs were examined for DsRed2-positive
metastases using a Leica MZFLIII fluorescence stereomicroscope. Subsequently, the retroperitoneum was dissected. Interval levels (200 Am) were
cut to confirm lymph node and organ metastasis by histology. Experimental
lung metastases were initiated by tail vein injection. Cell viability in
suspension remained >95% by ViaCount Assay (Guava Technologies) until
all injections were completed. Four doses of 30 mg/kg 17-DMAG
intraperitoneally were given at 12 h intervals, the first dose at f30 min
before tail vein inoculation. Mice were monitored for distress and isolated if
sickness occurred. Sick mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxia if there was
no clinical improvement.
Animal computer tomography (microCT). Development of lung
disease was monitored by serial microCT. Images were acquired on a GE
Locus Ultra microCT (80 kVp, 50 mA, voxel size: 150 Am) and analysis was
conducted on GE Microview (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). Mice were
maintained under isoflurane anesthesia during image acquisition.
High-performance liquid chromatography. 17-DMAG drug tissue
concentrations were measured in xenograft tumors using a highperformance liquid chromatography method as described previously (20).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done using Mann-Whitney
test and ANOVA. Two-tailed P values < 0.05 were considered significant.
Kaplan-Meier survival data were compared using the log-rank test.
GraphPad Prism version 5.01 software was used.

Results
FAK is overexpressed in HGSIL and cervical SCC. Previous
research indicated that FAK overexpression is an early event in
cancer development (24). We aimed to reproduce these results in
our own cohort. Because transition from a preinvasive state toward
a more aggressive lesion is often associated with loss of cell-cell
adhesions, we also examined E-cadherin. Adjacent squamous
epithelium without intraepithelial neoplasia or signs of human
papillomavirus infection was scored for comparison. We observed
an increase of FAK expression from essentially unstained nonneoplastic epithelium to HGSIL and metastatic cancer. HGSIL and
cancer displayed mostly weak to moderate staining with some

exceptions, for example, strong focal FAK expression at the
invasion front or in a diffusely infiltrating carcinoma with partial
E-cadherin loss (Fig. 1). E-cadherin expression was strongest in
nonneoplastic epithelium and reduced or lost in HGSIL and
metastatic cancer. Differences in H-scores were only significant
between nonneoplastic epithelium and all other categories,
suggesting that both FAK expression and E-cadherin loss are
indeed early events during tumorigenesis.
FRNK decreases anchorage independence, migration, and
focal adhesion signaling. To test if FAK is active in cervical cancer
cells, we generated FRNK-SiHa, a cell line with stable expression of
FRNK. The SiHa cell line was selected because of low E-cadherin
expression and nuclear positivity for Snail1, suggesting a less
differentiated phenotype compared with other cervical lines such
as ME180 (data not shown). Both SiHa and ME180 cells, however,

retain human cytokeratin expression (AE1/AE3). Cell growth in
monolayer culture over 5 days and colony formation were not
significantly affected in FRNK-SiHa (data not shown), but
anchorage-independent growth assays showed significantly smaller
FRNK-SiHa colonies (Fig. 2A).
Migration and invasion of FRNK-SiHa were tested with
fibronectin as chemoattractant. Migration was decreased by
40% and consistent with a diminished fibronectin response
(Fig. 2B). Invasion was decreased by 40% to 60% (data not shown)
but failed to reach statistical significance likely due to the weak
stimulatory effect of fibronectin. Basal phosphorylation levels of
FAK Y397 (autophosphorylation) and Y861 and Y925 (Src-dependent)
were reduced in FRNK-SiHa (Fig. 2C). Paxillin Y118 was 50%
decreased similar to p130Cas Y165, Y249, and Y410, indicating an
inhibited downstream signaling due to FRNK. Paxillin Y31 remained

unaffected. No difference was seen for Akt and extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation (data not shown). Treatment
with 10 Amol/L nocodazole for 4 h with subsequent washout was
used to examine focal adhesion dynamics (25). A f2-fold increase
of FAK Y397 and Y925 in vector-control but not in FRNK-SiHa cells
(Fig. 2D) suggested a decreased focal adhesion turnover.
FRNK and 17-DMAG similarly interfere with focal adhesion
turnover. To determine the effect of Hsp90 inhibition on basal
phosphorylation and total protein levels of FAK, monolayer
cultures were treated with increasing doses of geldanamycin and
17-DMAG, and 100 nmol/L of either compound caused a profound
decrease in FAK Y397 and a somewhat less noticeable decrease in
FAK protein after 24 h (Fig. 3A). Paxillin and the established client
Akt responded with a profound decrease of either protein level.
Hsp70 was already induced at 10 nmol/L concentration, indicating

that the heat shock response precedes client protein destabilization. Next, we addressed the question if 17-DMAG was able to
cause a blunting of stimulated FAK signaling. Figure 3B shows a
dose-dependent suppression of the response to epidermal growth
factor. FAK activity was suppressed below baseline if the treatment
was extended >20 h. Consequently, 17-DMAG also decreased SiHa
cell migration against epidermal growth factor (Fig. 3C). A similar
suppression of fibronectin stimulation was observed, albeit at
lower overall phosphorylation levels (data not shown).
To examine if altered FAK signaling was reflected by changes in
cell and focal adhesion morphology, SiHa cells were treated with
100 nmol/L geldanamycin or 17-DMAG and double-labeled for
actin and either FAK, paxillin, or vinculin. Drug-treated cells were
compared with FRNK-SiHa, wild-type, and vector-control cells for
cell area and focal adhesion length. FRNK-SiHa and Hsp90

confirmed our results (data not shown). Immunofluorescence for
FAK using clone77 antibody produced a diminished labeling of
focal adhesions in FRNK-SiHa (Fig. 4C and D), consistent with a
displacement of endogenous FAK. Together, these results suggest
that Hsp90 inhibition suppresses focal adhesion turnover in a
manner similar to FRNK.
FRNK delays tumor growth and lung metastasis formation
in SiHa xenograft models. Next, we determined if the suppressed
FAK activity in FRNK-SiHa would translate into changes in tumor
formation and metastatic potential. To screen for a potential
difference, FRNK-SiHa and vector-control cells were initially grown
in opposite flanks of single mice. This was repeated six times
starting from separate cultures for each injection. All mice, except
for one outlier, showed delayed tumor development for FRNK-SiHa.
To confirm this result, wild-type, FRNK-SiHa, and vector-control
cells were inoculated into flanks of individual mice showing a
significantly delayed tumor formation with FRNK (Fig. 5A). To
further examine metastatic potential and growth of these
xenografts, we implanted a fragment of each dissected xenograft
into the cervix of a recipient mouse. Due to extensive necrosis in
large wild-type and vector-control tumors and the small size of
FRNK-SiHa donors on the contrary, a high variability was seen with
the resulting orthotopic xenografts and tumor weight differences
were not significant. However, there was a trend toward smaller
tumors with FRNK-SiHa (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Three distant
retroperitoneal tumor deposits were found in each of the wild-type
and vector-control groups by histology (250 Am levels) but none in
FRNK-SiHa (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Finally, to address the effect
of FRNK on metastatic colonization, each cell line was tail vein
injected into 5 mice per group. Development of lung disease was
monitored over 3 months with four microCT imaging sessions.
There were three early unscheduled deaths, one in each group. The
remaining mice showed a trend toward lower disease burden in
FRNK-SiHa, with 1 of 4 FRNK-SiHa versus 3 of 4 wild-type and 4 of
4 vector-control mice that developed extensive lung disease
(Supplementary Fig. S5C).
17-DMAG suppresses in vivo FAK signaling, tumor growth,
and metastasis. Proceeding from earlier results (20), we wished to
examine if 17-DMAG treatment can cause a detectable suppression
of FAK signaling in vivo. Mice harboring orthotopic xenografts were
treated with two different dose levels of 17-DMAG by either oral
gavage or intraperitoneal injection four times in 12 h intervals.
Because decreased phosphorylation often seems to precede client
degradation (23), we focused on two FAK phosphorylation sites
(Y397/Y861) as well as Akt S473 (Fig. 5B). Immunoblotting revealed a
statistically significant FAK Y397 down-regulation and Hsp70 upregulation at 30 mg/kg 17-DMAG. Drug tissue concentrations for
oral versus intraperitoneal application were consistent with a
reported oral bioavailability of f50% (Supplementary Fig. S6A). No
difference was noted between ME180 and SiHa xenografts at the
same dose level. Because the FAK Y861 antibody distinctly labels cell
membranes, we stained control and 30 mg/kg treated SiHa
xenografts by immunohistochemistry to confirm our immunoblot
results. One control specimen was excluded due to tissue
disaggregation, which interfered with membrane staining and
image analysis (Supplementary Fig. S6B). The remaining specimens
revealed, as by immunoblotting, a 40% reduction in FAK
phosphorylation (Fig. 5C).
To examine the consequences of short-term Hsp90 inhibition, we
initiated a lung metastasis model (Fig. 6A). Progression of lung
disease was monitored by microCT. We observed a significant

survival advantage in the 17-DMAG-treated group versus control.
Most mice were euthanized because of terminal lung disease.
Figure 6B and Supplementary Fig. S7A and B show representative
microCT images. By autopsy, we also detected four tumor-embolic
kidney infarcts (three in controls and one in 17-DMAG) and two
cases of bowel ischemia (one in control and one in 17-DMAG;
Supplementary Fig. S7C). Two controls developed hind-leg paresis
presumably due to peripheral emboli because no brain abnormality
was found. Eight treated mice lived to the end of the experiment
without signs of disease.
Finally, we addressed whether chronic administration of 17DMAG could suppress tumor growth and metastasis. DsRed2
fluorescent SiHa cells were used for easier detection of metastases
from orthotopic xenografts. 17-DMAG was given as a total of

15 treatments and all mice were killed on day 33. There was a 64%
decrease in mean tumor weight in the 17-DMAG group (Fig. 6C)
but no change in body weight, suggesting that the treatment was
well tolerated (Fig. 6D). Seven of 10 controls but none of the treated
mice had detectable metastases. Histology confirmed a total of
10 metastases [4 retroperitoneal deposits partially with adjacent
lymph node, 3 metastases to the diaphragm, and 1 each in liver,
stomach, and kidney (Supplementary Fig. S8)].

Discussion
FAK has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target, particularly
in the context of tumor invasion and metastasis (2, 5). Its
overexpression occurs as an early event during tumorigenesis

and has been described in different cancer entities including SCC
of mucosal surfaces (24, 26–30). Increased FAK expression in precursor lesions and frankly invasive cervical cancer is an intriguing
finding because an inverse relationship between p53 and FAK has
been reported, which is consistent with p53 instability due to human
papillomavirus E6 viral protein as essential etiologic factor (31, 32).
Ochel and colleagues first described FAK as a Hsp90 client (7), and
recent research has highlighted the dependence of the kinase on
intact Hsp90 chaperone action in vitro (23). However, few data
on FAK inhibition in cervical cancer and the potential of Hsp90
inhibitors to target FAK function in vivo are available to date. Thus,
we examined the consequences of compromised FAK signaling
using FRNK and 17-DMAG in different models of cervical cancer.
FRNK has been used extensively to elucidate FAK functions
(33, 34), and based on its conditional expression, van Nimwegen
and colleagues (35) showed that FAK was required for the early
phase of lung metastasis formation. Thus, transient inhibition of

FAK at specific stages of the metastatic cascade might interrupt a
process that is the most frequent cause of death in the cancer
host. To pursue this path, we first determined the FAK expression
in our own patient cohort, which showed a significant increase of
FAK in HGSIL and cancer compared with nonneoplastic epithelium. Stable expression of FRNK in SiHa, a cell line with epithelialto-mesenchymal transition characteristics, did not affect proliferation in monolayers but suppressed anchorage-independent
growth. This is in line with previous reports that found no change
of in vitro or even in vivo growth with FRNK depending on cell
context (33, 35, 36). Decreased anchorage-independence in SiHaFRNK is likely a consequence of altered FAK signaling as shown
previously in classic experiments with FAK-/- cells (37). Enlarged
focal adhesions and stress fiber formation are potentially due to a
decreased Rac activity downstream of p130Cas, which may shift the
balance toward Rho/ROCK (38). Changes consistent with these
observations were also found after pharmacologic Hsp90 inhibition

17-DMAG Targets FAK and Tumor Progression

Figure 6. 17-DMAG decreases disease
burden in two SiHa metastasis models.
A, 17-DMAG improves the survival in a
lung metastasis model after injection of 1
 106 cells into the tail vein. B, two
microCT imaging sessions (days 79-85
and 98-102 post-inoculation) illustrate the
delayed lung metastasis formation in one
treated compared with one control mouse.
The control shows nodular metastases
predominantly in the right lung and
progression to extensive disease. The
treated animal has no detectable
metastases during CT1 and developed
three nodules in the left posterior lung
apparent on CT2 (arrowheads).
Anatomically equivalent scan sections are
shown from both sessions. Histologic
correlation is shown in Supplementary
Fig. S7. C, 25 mg/kg 17-DMAG three
times a week intraperitoneally significantly
decreases orthotopic tumor growth and
prevents metastases (Supplementary Fig.
S8). D, no significant difference in body
weight was noted between 17-DMAG and
controls. An early transient decrease in
body weight (days 1-5) was due to
postoperative stress.

with 17-DMAG. Although essentially correlative, our data support
the notion of FAK as an important client within the focal adhesion
complex. Because Hsp90 function is inextricably interwoven with
the stability of a host of clients, destabilization of other
promigratory molecules may contribute to the observed effect.
However, it has been argued that the pleiotropism of Hsp90
inhibitors may result in a more sustained drug response; indeed, a
compromised FAK function might less likely be bypassed by an
increased Src activity in that context (39). Preclinical and clinical
testing of small-molecule FAK inhibitors will provide further
mechanistic insights into this matter.
17-DMAG significantly decreased but did not abolish FAK
phosphorylation in our xenografts. Yet, we hypothesized that a
short-term treatment during a critical phase of tumor progression,

that is, escape from anoikis and extravasation, could be effective in
preventing the metastatic colonisation of a target organ. Indeed,
17-DMAG treatment resulted in a survival advantage and lower
disease burden consistent with the proposed role of FAK during the
early phase of the metastatic process (35). This is encouraging
considering the short plasma half-life of 17-DMAG, which might
limit the exposure of circulating cells to effective drug concentrations (40). Although Hsp90 and extracellular Hsp90a undoubtedly contribute to cell migration and metastasis (16, 41), there has
recently been some controversy due to prometastatic effects of
Hsp90 inhibition observed in other models (42, 43). For 17-DMAG,
there are only few reported studies that address antimetastatic
activity based on different models reflecting parts of the metastatic
cascade (44, 45). Thus, we tested 17-DMAG in a spontaneously

metastasising SiHa orthotopic xenograft model and were able to
show suppressed primary tumor growth and abolished metastasis.
Although our results show efficacy against xenograft growth and
metastasis in SiHa, they do not strictly distinguish between these
two processes. However, during this work, we also generated a
FRNK-expressing variant of the keratinizing cell line ME180 using
the same expression system. Although equivalent levels of FAK and
FRNK were determined in monolayer cultures of SiHa and ME180,
the latter cell line did not show a delayed xenograft growth in
response to FRNK. Also, the number of metastases from orthotopic
ME180 xenografts did not lower significantly after chronic 17DMAG treatment despite a 54% decreased mean tumor size (data
not shown). A lower FAK phosphorylation (Fig. 5B, lane 1 versus
lane 6), likely due to lower FAK expression in xenografts
(Supplementary Fig. S9), was noted for ME180 and left us to
speculate that Hsp90-independent mechanisms may play a role in
these xenografts. Indeed, FAK has been linked to the acquisition of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition features (46, 47). By contrast,
amoeboid invasion is likely independent from FAK (48).
While this work was in progress, the clinical development of
17-DMAG by Kosan Biosciences (June 2008: Bristol-Myers Squibb)
was terminated. Several fully synthetic Hsp90-inhibitory compounds currently under development are expected to have better
side-effect profiles (14). An enhancement of cervical cancer cell
radiosensitivity by Hsp90 inhibition has been shown previously (49)
and should be further pursued using those compounds. Notably,
Hsp90-inhibitory and heat shock-modulating effects have recently
also been recognized for cisplatin (50).

In summary, we show here that FAK is a potential therapeutic
target in metastatic SCC of the uterine cervix, the function of which
can be compromised by pharmacologic inhibition of Hsp90 both
in vitro and in xenografts. Interference with FAK function suppressed
tumor growth and metastatic colonization in two different model
systems of poorly differentiated SCC. Additional work is needed to
elucidate the function(s) of Hsp90 during tumor progression and to
examine the efficacy of its inhibitors in the context of cancer with
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition features.
