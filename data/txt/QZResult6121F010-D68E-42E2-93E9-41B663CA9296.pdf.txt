ABSTRACT
Tamoxifen therapy resistance constitutes a major cause of death in patients with
recurrent estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. Through high resolution
mass spectrometry (MS), we previously generated a 4-protein predictive signature
for tamoxifen therapy outcome in recurrent breast cancer. ANXA1 and CALD1, which
were not included in the classifier, were however the most differentially expressed
proteins. We first evaluated the clinical relevance of these markers in our MS cohort,
followed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining on an independent set of tumors
incorporated in a tissue microarray (TMA) and regression analysis in relation to time
to progression (TTP), clinical benefit and objective response. In order to assess which
mechanisms ANXA1 and CALD1 might been involved in, we performed Ingenuity
pathway analysis (IPA) on ANXA1 and CALD1 correlated proteins in our MS cohort.
ANXA1 (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22–2.75; P = 0.003)
and CALD1 (HR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.04–2.36; P = 0.039) based patient stratification
showed significant association to TTP, while IHC staining on TMA showed that both
ANXA1 (HR = 1.82; 95% CI: 1.12–3.00; P = 0.016) and CALD1 (HR = 2.29; 95%
CI: 1.40–3.75; P = 0.001) expression was associated with shorter TTP independently
of traditional predictive factors. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the majority
of proteins correlated to ANXA1 also correlated with CALD1. IPA indicated that ANXA1
and CALD1 were associated with ER-downregulation and NFκB signaling. We hereby
report that ANXA1 and CALD1 proteins are independent markers for tamoxifen therapy
outcome and are associated to fast tumor progression.

INTRODUCTION

tamoxifen has been the first choice for decades, both in the
adjuvant and in the recurrent setting [1]. In the adjuvant
setting, tamoxifen significantly increases patient survival and
decreases the risk of metastasis occurrence [2]. In recurrent
ER positive breast cancer, approximately 50% of patients

all breast malignancies. Treatment options of patients with
such tumors include targeted anti-hormonal drugs, of which

treated with tamoxifen manifests intrinsic drug resistance,
while the other half experiences acquired resistance during
therapy [3, 4]. Many studies have described mechanisms
of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer patients, such as
the upregulation of ER transcriptional co-activators [5] or
the expression of ER isoforms [6], the activation of several
tyrosine kinase pathways such as PI3K/MAPK [7], or the
dysregulation of tamoxifen metabolizing enzymes [8].
Acquired mutations in the ligand-binding domain of ESR1
protein (e.g. p.Tyr537Ser) during endocrine treatment have
also been associated with constitutive agonistic activity of the
receptor and the unresponsiveness to anti hormonal therapies
[9–11]. Furthermore, gene expression analyses have been
performed to derive biomarkers predictive of tamoxifen
therapy outcome in both the adjuvant and the recurrent
settings [12, 13]. So far, none of these markers have found
clinical application due to non-optimal study design, lack
of extensive sample validation, or difficulty in developing
assays into an accurate and standardized format [14, 15].
Proteomics-based technologies have shown to
enable expansion of the depth of biomarker investigation
[16], adding new layers of information to the clinical and
biological profiling of diseases [17–19]. Advancements
in liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS)
instruments now enable almost full coverage of the proteincoding genome, and quantitation of even slight changes
in protein expression [20, 21]. Furthermore, targeted MS
techniques provide accurate and absolute quantitation
of target analytes, making them suitable for both
biomarker verification and clinical diagnostics [22, 23].
In our laboratory, we have developed a tissue proteomics
biomarker discovery pipeline combining laser capture
microdissection with high resolution MS analysis and

label free quantitation for the analysis of breast carcinomas
[24, 25], allowing us to not only establish a robust platform
for biomarker discovery but also dissect the underlying
biological mechanisms in epithelial tumors. Through this
pipeline, we previously analyzed a cohort of snap frozen
ER positive primary tumors and developed a 4-protein
signature – comprising PDCD4, CNG, OCIAD1, and
G3BP2 – predicting poor outcome to tamoxifen treatment
with 86.7% sensitivity and 41.5% specificity  [26].
However, the 4 proteins included in the classifier did not
display extreme differential levels between tamoxifen
outcome groups, suggesting that other factors may be
involved in tamoxifen treatment outcome. In order to
address this, we combined our initial MS cohorts and
assessed which proteins manifested the highest change in
expression between patient groups. The top candidates were
selected based on significance after statistical evaluation
of their abundance levels between patient groups, and
their association to TTP was assessed in MS analyzed
samples. Furthermore, IHC analysis of an independent
cohort of tumors incorporated in a TMA provided further
marker verification. In order to assess which pathways the
top molecules were involved in, correlation and pathway
analyses were performed. A schematic representation of the
study`s workflow is reported in Figure 1.

filtering for missing values (Figure S2), a total of 20 out of
235 tumor tissues displayed ANXA1 positivity (Figure 3A).
ANXA1 presence was significantly associated with shorter
TTP in both univariate (HR = 2.99; 95% CI: 2.14 – 4.16;
P  < 0.001) and multivariate (HR  =  1.82; 95% CI: 1.12
– 3.00; P = 0.016) Cox regression analyses (Table  1;
Figure 4A). CALD1 positivity (Figure 3B) was observed in
21 out of 259 patients and Cox regression analysis showed
a significant positive correlation with shorter TTP both in
univariate (HR = 2.43; 95% CI: 1.52 – 3.89; P < 0.001) and
multivariate (HR = 2.29; 95% CI: 1.40 – 3.75; P = 0.001)
analyses (Table 2; Figure 4B). In addition to this, we
analyzed whether the associations of ANXA1 and CALD1
with TTP were independent of each other in the subset
of 235 tumor tissues for which both measurements were
available. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that
both ANXA1 (HR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.16 – 3.10; P = 0.010)
and CALD1 (HR = 2.29; 95% CI: 1.40 – 3.74; P = 0.001)
were independently correlated to TTP (Table  S4).
Furthermore, in order to evaluate whether ANXA1 and
CALD1 could be used in combination we merged IHC
stainings into four categories: positive/positive, positive/
negative, negative/positive, and negative/negative. ANXA1
and CALD1 staining only were observed in 17 and 16

(i.e. t test) was performed on all 1,960 quantified proteins
(Table S1) in our 112 patient MS cohort (Clinical and
histo- pathological characteristics are reported in Table S2).
Based on significance levels, ANXA1 (t test P < 0.001;
fold change = 1.90) and CALD1 (t test P < 0.001; fold
change = 2.06) proteins were selected as top candidates
(Figure 2A and Figure S1). In addition to this, survival
analysis was performed on ANXA1 and CALD1-stratified
patients, with TTP as endpoint. A significant difference
was observed between patients who displayed high levels
(based on median expression) of ANXA1 (HR = 1.83;
95% CI: 1.22 – 2.75; P = 0.003) and CALD1 (HR = 1.57;
95% CI: 1.04 – 2.36; P = 0.039) proteins (Figure 2B).
These data show that ANXA1 and CALD1 are positively
associated to faster disease progression after tamoxifen
treatment in ER positive recurrent breast cancer.

Validation of ANXA1 and CALD1
as independent markers using
immunohistochemistry
In order to further confirm our findings, ANXA1 and
CALD1 protein levels were assessed through IHC staining
on an independent cohort of 408 FFPE tumor tissues
derived from patients that received tamoxifen as first

Fold ratio = 1.90; left) and CALD1 (t test P = 0.00019; Fold ratio = 2.06; right) were highly differentially expressed in the poor outcome
group. Stratification of patients according to median protein level showed that a significant difference was observed between ANXA1 (left)
and CALD1 (right) protein levels (Panel B).

co-expression of the two markers. For all three positive
categories (i.e. ANXA1 positive/CALD1 negative; ANXA1
negative/CALD1 positive; ANXA1 positive/CALD1
positive) an association with shorter TTP was found
(Table S5, Figure S3). However, due to the low amount
of tumors comprised in each category, further verification
is needed to assess whether ANXA1 and CALD1 can be
used in combination to effectively identify fast progressing
breast carcinomas.

association of ANXA1 staining to clinical benefit to

logistic regression analysis (Table S8). No association
was found between CALD1 staining and objective

showed significant association with the type of response,
while ANXA1 displayed only borderline significance,
combination of ANXA1 and CALD1 stainings was
not performed using tumor response as the endpoint of
tamoxifen therapy. Overall, these data suggest a significant
relationship between ANXA1 and CALD1 positivity and
early tumor progression after tamoxifen treatment for
recurrent ER positive breast cancer.

signaling (Z-score = 3.00; Fisher P = 9.59E– 10; Table S12),
pointing out that molecules involved in inflammation might
be correlated to tamoxifen poor outcome. Upstream analysis
showed that ER signaling was downregulated (Z-score =
–2.111; Fisher`s P = 1.39E–07; Table S13), suggesting a
link between ANXA1 and CALD1 related proteins in the
disruption of ER signaling. Molecular interaction analysis
indicated that both CALD1 and ANXA1 were comprised
in a network along with proteins involved in cellular
movement and immune response (Focus molecules:
28; P-score = 48; Figure 5B). This network comprised
proteins belonging to the extracellular matrix (e.g. APOE;
COL4A2) and proteins involved in cell movement (e.g.
MYL12B) and cell adhesion (e.g. ICAM1). Molecule
activity prediction based on proteins Log ratios pointed
out that molecules in the network were not only involved
in ER down-regulation, but were also associated with

As ANXA1 and CALD1 showed to be highly
expressed in the poor outcome patient group, Pearson
correlation analysis of abundance levels of all proteins
in the MS dataset to ANXA1 and CALD1 expression
was performed. After selection of only highly correlated
proteins, correlation analysis yielded a total of 115 (e.g.
SERPINH1) and 110 (e.g. Vinculin) proteins correlated to
ANXA1 and CALD1, respectively. Of these, 73 (i.e. more
than 60% in both lists) correlated with both ANXA1 and
CALD1 levels (Tables S10 and S11 Figure 5A), suggesting
that these proteins presented a shared biology. In the light
of this we merged the two correlated protein lists and
performed pathway analysis of ANXA1 and CALD1 and
their associated proteins through IPA software. Canonical
pathway analysis showed activation of acute phase response

the activation of the focal adhesion kinase and NFκB
pathways. Overall, these data suggest that ANXA1 and
CALD1, along with their correlated proteins, are associated
with down-regulation of ER signaling and the activation
of inflammation response mechanisms. However, further
verification in breast cancer model systems are required to
confirm these hypotheses.

outcome group. Furthermore ANXA and CALD1 have
already been described as cell migration and markers of
an epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) –like phenotype
in ER negative breast cancer cell line models [29, 30],
though their role in ER positive tumors still needs to be
functionally elucidated.
In order to confirm our MS findings, we performed
IHC stainings of both ANXA1 and CALD1 in an
independent cohort of FFPE ER positive tumor tissues
captured in a TMA to assess the clinical relevance of
these markers. Our regression analyses showed that not
only ANXA1 (HR = 1.82) and CALD1 (HR = 2.40)
stainings were significantly associated with shorter TTP
independently of traditional predictive factors, but also
contributed in stratifying patient groups independently
of each other. Combination of IHC stainings suggested
that ANXA1 and CALD1 could be used in concert to
discriminate patients who would suffer from fast disease
progression after first line tamoxifen, however the
relatively small size of these groups implies that further
verification in a larger patient cohort is necessary. Though
association of CALD1 to breast cancer therapy outcome
has been poorly assessed so far, ANXA1 expression was
previously associated to BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and
prediction of high mortality risk in Her2+ patients [30].

DISCUSSION
Resistance to tamoxifen is still a major cause
of death in patients with ER positive recurrent breast
cancer [27]. The advanced state of current proteomic
technologies allows profiling of biological samples for
discovery of disease biomarkers [28]. Indeed also in
recurrent ER positive breast cancer, using our dedicated
tissue proteomics workflow, we developed and validated
a 4-protein signature predictive of tamoxifen treatment
outcome [26]. Despite the fact that our predictor is capable
of discriminating patient groups displaying good and poor
outcome to tamoxifen therapy, the 4 signature proteins
alone are unlikely capable of addressing the full extent of
resistance mechanisms. Out of a panel of 1,960 proteins,
ANXA1 and CALD1 constituted the top 2 significant
proteins and were shown to be overexpressed in the poor

Figure 3: Immunohistochemical stainings of ANXA1 and CALD1 proteins. Breast carcinomas included in the TMA displayed
either ANXA1 positivity or negativity (A). Strong ANXA1 staining was found ubiquitously in stromal cells (black arrows) and was not
taken into account in the survival analysis. CALD1 IHC staining was found at the membrane and cytoplasm of both carcinoma and stromal
cells, but the latter was not taken into account for survival analyses (B).

Our data might suggest an additional role of ANXA1 and
CALD1 in disease progression after tamoxifen therapy of
ER positive recurrent breast cancers.
In order to better investigate which proteins and
molecular pathways were connected to ANXA1 and
CALD1, we performed pathway analysis on a cohort
of ER positive tumors which were previously analyzed
by high resolution MS. Proteins that were found to be
correlated to ANXA1 and CALD1 levels were associated
not only with inflammatory response (canonical pathway
analysis), but also with activation of the NFκB pathway,
downregulation of ER signaling and focal adhesion
(molecule activity prediction). Similar findings were
reported before as ANXA1 has been shown to be
associated with increased metastatic potential in MCF-7

breast cancer cell lines following downregulation of ER
and the expression of basal markers (e.g. vinculin) [31].
Moreover, studies on breast cancer cell line models have
shown that constitutive activation of the NFκB pathway
leads to downregulation of ER signaling [32], which can
have a prominent role in tamoxifen resistance, if not in
a generalized anti-hormonal therapy unresponsiveness. In
another study elucidating the role of ANXA1 in relation
to NFκB activation, it was shown that its interaction with
the IKK complex led to the constitutive activation of this
pathway, promoting metastasis and decreasing survival
in an intracardiac metastatic model [33]. The constitutive
activation of NFκB signaling in cancer cells favors not
only cell survival, but also the acquisition of a more
malignant phenotype [34]. ANXA1 was also associated

with acquisition of an EMT-like phenotype in ER negative
breast cancer cell line models through activation of TGFβ
signaling [28]. Although pathway analysis did not show a
direct activation of the TGFβ pathway, cross-talk between
TGFβ and NFκB has already been described in various
forms of cancer, in which one pathway modulates the

other via activation of binding proteins [35] or of microRNAs [36]. In contrast, it has been shown that expression
of ANXA1 was related to inhibition of NFκB in pancreatic
and colon cancer cell lines [37], while in Adriamycinresistant bladder cancer, ANXA1 has been reported to
be downregulated [38]. In the light of this, ANXA1 may

be associated with the constitutive activation of NFκB
signaling in a tissue-specific manner, which would on
one side lead tumor cells to become estrogen-independent
and on the other side promote a more aggressive and
mesenchymal-like phenotype, though further studies
need to be performed in order to confirm this function.
Nonetheless, a possible novel treatment option for ANXA1
positive, tamoxifen resistant tumors would consist of
blocking antibodies, which have already shown efficacy
in inhibiting migration and invasion rates in pancreatic
carcinoma cells [39].
CALD1 is an actin-, calmodulin- and myosinbinding protein that has been described as a cell motility
suppressor by stabilizing stress fibers through F-actin
binding [40, 41]. Despite its role in downregulating cell
motility by cytoskeletal rearrangements, CALD1 has
also been described as a key component in TGFβ-driven
EMT via its overexpression [42]. In addition to this,
downregulation of ER in MCF7 cells has been linked
to the upregulation of CALD1, concomitantly with
the acquisition of a new phenotype that encompasses
increased growth rates, loss of cell-to-cell adhesion and
a redistribution of the cytoskeletal components, resulting
in increased motility [31]. In addition to this, CALD1
interaction with cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iβ has
been shown to regulate cell invasion and migration in
breast cancer cell lines [29]. Similar to ANXA1, also
CALD1 has been shown to display opposite roles in cancer
and invasion, since its expression has been associated to
reduced cell invasion in colon cancer cell lines [43]. In
this perspective, CALD1 may be another key effector
in cytoskeletal rearrangements and the acquisition of a
rapid spreading tumor phenotype in breast tissue, while
countering those effects in other tissue types.
As both ANXA1 and CALD1 have been reported
to be expressed in basal-type breast cancers, which are
characterized by downregulation of ER and its responsive
genes [44], and the fact that only a minority of the ER
positive tumors that were captured in the TMA displayed
expression of these markers, it is possible that these
proteins may enable further stratification of ER positive
breast malignancies. In the perspective of tamoxifen
resistance, ANXA1 and CALD1 may be involved in the
activation of the NFκB pathway, which would promote
cell survival by blocking intrinsic (mitochondrialmediated) and extrinsic (death receptors-mediated)
apoptotic signals and render cancer cells independent of
estrogens. In addition to this, the acquisition of a rapidly
spreading and fast growing tumor cell phenotype would
result in a faster tumor progression, and probably an
estrogen-independent phenotype.
We have here shown that ANXA1 and CALD1
are associated with tamoxifen therapy clinical outcome
in recurrent ER positive breast cancer. Expression of
these proteins not only correlates with shorter TTP
independently of traditional predictive factors, but
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

these markers also contributed independently of one
another. In other words, ANXA1 and CALD1, alone or
in combination, are able to identify groups of patients
that would less likely benefit from tamoxifen therapy. In
addition to this, pathway analysis suggested that ANXA1
and CALD1 are likely linked to the downregulation of ER
signaling and acquisition of a more malignant phenotype
with EMT-like features. Blocking such pathways would
probably constitute an effective additional or substitutive
therapy in patients expressing such markers, however
further functional studies should be performed in order
to determine causal effects of these proteins in these
signaling cascades.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
MS dataset
A total of 112 ER positive tissues were analyzed
by high resolution MS after LCM-based breast
carcinoma cell enrichment, as previously described
[26]. MaxQuant (version 1.2.2.5; search engine:
Andromeda) [45, 46] results of Orbitrap. RAW data
deposited in ProteomeXchange via PRIDE repository
(dataset identifiers: PXD000484 and PXD000485) [47]
from previously described sets [26] were imported in
Microsoft Excel and normalized for inter-batch effects
using ComBat algorithm in R environment [48] allowing
10 minimum observations across all samples. Outcome
to tamoxifen treatment was defined based on TTP, with
a 6 months cutoff: patient whose tumors progressed
within (≤) 6 months after start of therapy were defined
as poor outcome, while progression after (>) 6 months
was defined as good outcome. This set comprised
67 good and 47 poor outcome patients, respectively.
Protein differential expression between patient groups
was tested by t test (two sided test, unequal variances
assumed) in Microsoft Excel. Top candidates were
selected based on t test P and their relation to TTP was
confirmed by survival analysis through survival analysis
of patients stratified according to median level of protein
expression.

TMA dataset
A total of 447 FFPE tissues collected from Erasmus
MC and regional hospitals were incorporated in a TMA.
For statistical analysis only ER positive tumors from
patients who did not receive any adjuvant hormonal
therapy were included. Furthermore, patients who showed
no tumors after histological revision or manifested disease
progression before (≤) 3 weeks after start of therapy were
excluded. In addition, tumors that were comprised in the
MS sets were also excluded. This led to the inclusion of
a total of 408 ER positive tumors, of which response data
were collected according to the standard International
3106

Oncotarget

Union Against Cancer criteria [49]. Eleven (2.70%) and
51 (12.50%) patients showed complete remission (CR)
and partial remission (PR), respectively. Two hundred
and five patients showed no change (NC) of disease,
of whom 35 (8.58%) displayed NC for less (≤) than 6
months, while 170 (41.66%) showed NC for longer (>)
than 6 months (defined as stable disease [SD]). A total of
141 (34.56%) patients displayed progressive disease (PD).
Clinical benefit was defined as CR + PR + SD patients
(n = 232; 57%), while objective response was defined as
CR + PR only (n = 62; 15%). This retrospective study
used coded primary tumor tissues, in accordance with the
Code of Conduct of the Federation of Medical Scientific
Societies in the Netherlands (http://www.federa.org/codesconduct). Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker
Prognostic Studies were followed where possible [50].

for 45 min at room temperature. A washing cycle with PBS
was performed for 5 min and a 1:15 solution of DAB+
chromogen in DAB+ substrate buffer was added, following
incubation in the dark for 10 min. Slides were then washed
in tap water for 5 min, stained with hematoxylin/eosin
for 1 min each and dehydrated again through sequential
washings in 50%–70%–100% ethanol and xylene of 5
min each. Cover glasses were mounted with Pertex and
slides were left to dry. ANXA1 and CALD1 stained tissue
sections were scored only for quantity of stained carcinoma
cells due to the fact that all stained tumors displayed strong
staining intensity. Scoring was performed by an experienced
researcher in a blind manner, and triplicate scores were
assessed and validated by a second experienced researcher,
who was extensively trained by a specialized breast
pathologist. Fibroblasts, endothelial cells and leukocytes
displayed strong ubiquitous ANXA1 and CALD1 stainings
as well, while adipocytes only stained for ANXA1 (Figure
S4A-S4B). Only staining in breast carcinoma cells were
taken into account for further analyses. Slides were
digitalized and analyzed using Slidepath software (Leica
Microsystems, Solms, Germany).

Tissue micro-array
TMA was prepared using an ATA 27 (Beecher
Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). 447 paraffin-embedded
primary, ER positive breast cancer tissues derived from
patients who received tamoxifen as first-line therapy for
recurrent disease were used to prepare the TMA. Tissue
cores of 0.6 mm were taken from each tissue paraffin block
and transferred in triplicate into a TMA recipient block.
For each tumor tissue sample, three different areas of the
tumor were taken as biological replicates. TMA slides were
digitalized and analyzed using Slidepath software (Leica
Microsystems, Solms, Germany).

Statistical analysis of IHC staining results
Staining scores of TMA incorporated tissues were
filtered for missing data, stringently excluding cores for
which triplicate measurement was not available (e.g. due
to loss of core during staining procedure or not enough
[< 35] carcinoma cells observed in at least one core),
leading to a set of 317 tissue samples for ANXA1, a list
of 259 tissues for CALD1, and a list of 235 tissues for
both ANXA1 and CALD1 (Figure S2). Due to the fact that
tumor tissues displayed high quantities of stained breast
carcinoma cells, both ANXA1 and CALD1 were scored
as either absent or present. Association of ANXA1 and
CALD1 stainings with TTP or response data were tested
by Cox and logistic regression, respectively. Patient age,
disease free interval, dominant site of relapse, progesterone
receptor (PgR) positivity, HER2 overexpression, and
degree of tumor differentiation (Bloom-Richardson) were
included in all regression analyses. With the exception of
disease-free survival (to correct for prognosis), variables
that did not display any significant association with TTP or
any response criteria were excluded from the multivariate
regression models. Cox regression, logistic regression,
HRs, OR, and 95% CIs were calculated in Stata (v 13.1;
Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA).

Immunohistochemistry
Five µm sections of FFPE tissues captured on
the TMA were incubated at 60°C and washed in xylene
(3 × 5 min) for de-paraffination. Washings with decreasing
concentrations of ethanol were used to re-hydrate tissues
as follows: 100% ethanol (1 × 5 min, 2 × 2 min), 70%
ethanol (1 × 2 min), 50% ethanol (1 × 2 min), distilled
water (1 ×  2  min). Incubation with DAKO (Agilent
Technologies Inc, Glostrup, Denmark) antigen retrieval
solution diluted 1:10 in MilliQ water was performed at
95°C for 40 min. Slides were then cooled down to room
temperature and washed with PBS (3 × 5 min). Slides
were first incubated with 0.003% H2O2 in PBS to block
endogenous peroxidase (10  min) and subsequently with
blocking solution consisting of 5% BSA in PBS for
30 min. Anti-ANXA1 (Clone ID: 29/Annexin I;
Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY, USA) and
anti-CALD1 (Clone ID: TD107; Enzo Life Sciences
Inc., Farmingdale, NY, USA) mouse monoclonal primary
antibodies were diluted 1:2000 (ANXA1) and 1:400
(CALD1), respectively, in DAKO Antibody Diluent,
and slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
Slides were then washed with PBS, and DAKO Envision®
secondary antibody (labeled polymer HRP -Mouse, 200 µl
per slide) solution was added to each slide and incubated

Extraction of proteomics data and pathway
analysis
ANXA1 and CALD1 levels were correlated with the
rest of the quantified dataset through Pearson correlation. The
distribution of correlation coefficients was analyzed by Z-score;
cutoffs were selected according to the following formula:
Z-score cutoffs = mean ± 1.96 * (standard deviation)
3107

Oncotarget

Z-score transformed correlation coefficients that
fell below (< mean – 1.96 * [standard deviation]) or
above (> mean + 1.96 * [standard deviation]) the cutoffs
were selected as highly correlated proteins. IPA® (IPA,
Qiagen, Redwood City, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) was
performed selecting Uniprot identifiers and Log10 ratios
as input data (no ratio cutoff was selected). Pathway
analysis was run using Ingenuity Knowledge Base as
reference database. Analysis was run with the following
options enabled: homo sapiens was selected as species;
human tissues and breast cancer cell lines were selected
as protein expression sites; Mutation and Data Sources
options were kept as default (i.e. All). Interaction networks
were generated including endogenous chemicals and
maintaining other options as default (i.e. number of
Molecules per network: 35; number of Networks per
analysis: 25). Networks that showed the highest P-score
(i.e. P-score = −Log10 [Fisher`s P]) were subjected to
Molecule Activity Predictor in IPA.
