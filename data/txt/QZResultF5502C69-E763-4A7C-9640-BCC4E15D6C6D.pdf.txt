ABSTRACT:
Epigenetic therapy is emerging as a potential therapy for solid tumors. To
investigate its mechanism of action, we performed integrative expression and
methylation analysis of 63 cancer cell lines (breast, colorectal, and ovarian) after
treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacitidine (AZA). Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis demonstrated significant enrichment for immunomodulatory
pathways in all three cancers (14.4-31.3%) including interferon signaling, antigen
processing and presentation, and cytokines/chemokines. Strong upregulation of
cancer testis antigens was also observed. An AZA IMmune gene set (AIMs) derived
from the union of these immunomodulatory pathway genes classified primary tumors
from all three types into “high” and “low” AIM gene expression subsets in tumor
expression data from both TCGA and GEO. Samples from selected patient biopsies
showed upregulation of AIM genes after treatment with epigenetic therapy. These
results point to a broad immune stimulatory role for DNA demethylating drugs in
multiple cancers.

INTRODUCTION

methyltransferases (DNMTs). In recent years, inhibitors
of DNMTs (DNMTis) have emerged as therapeutic
targets for treatment of myeloid malignancies as well as
cutaneous T cell lymphoma. FDA approval was given to
the DNMT inhibitor 5-azacitidine (AZA) for treatment of
myelodysplastic syndrome in 2004 [2]. Several groups,
including ours, have focused on the therapeutic potential
of DNMT inhibitors in the treatment of solid tumors
with exciting early possibilities seen in non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) [3] and reversal of chemotherapy

Cancers are now recognized as being driven
by widespread changes in the epigenome including
changes in DNA methylation and chromatin packaging
[1]. Changes in DNA methylation include global
loss of methylation and focal gain of methylation at
promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes leading to
transcriptional silencing [1]. DNA methylation, a covalent
modification of DNA, is mediated by a family of DNA

resistance in ovarian cancers [4]. Recently, our group has
also seen exciting robust clinical responses in a small
number of patients with NSCLC who received therapy
to break immune tolerance after epigenetic therapy with
AZA, along with an HDAC inhibitor (HDACi), entinostat
[5].
Much of our above clinical trial work was driven
by our pre-clinical studies that showed how low doses
of DNMTis may avoid off-target effects, mimic doses
seen by patients’ tumor cells, and reprogram and inhibit
tumor cells, including cancer stem-like cells [6]. We
have now investigated, first using this pre-clinical
paradigm, the global response of 63 cultured cell lines
to transient, low-dose AZA in three common human
cancers (breast, colorectal and ovarian) by studying the
expression and methylation changes at multiple time
points. We demonstrate that AZA can upregulate a defined
set of immunomodulatory pathways (based on Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)) in all three cancer types and
we derive a gene panel reflecting this which we term AZA

IMmune genes (AIMs). We show how this panel divides
primary human cancers in all three cancer types, and other
cancer such as NSCLC and melanoma, into a “low” and
“high” AIM signature. Importantly, increased expression
of AIM genes could also be seen in subsets of patients
treated with AZA in breast and colorectal clinical trials, in
a comparison of pre- and post- treatment biopsy samples,
suggesting that epigenetic treatment causes enrichment,
in vivo, of immunomodulatory genes. Our data shows
that the AIM gene panel stratifies patients with common
human cancers into an immune low and immune enriched
group and suggests that patients with low expression of
AIM genes would benefit from epigenetic therapy when
combined with immunotherapy.

RESULTS
We explored further our understanding of the
global pathway changes after treatment with low doses

of the DNMTi AZA in cell lines from multiple common
human cancers. A total of 63 cancer cell lines (26 breast,
14 colorectal, and 23 ovarian) were treated with lowdose (500 nM) AZA for three days. DNA and RNA
were isolated at multiple time points following initial
drug application and analyzed for genome-wide changes
in DNA methylation (Illumina Infinium 450K) and
gene expression (Agilent 44K Expression Array). We
used these genomic data to identify the most enriched
pathway alterations as analyzed by GSEA [7] (Fig. 1,
Fig. S1) focusing upon the ~top 30% of all upregulated
and downregulated gene sets. GSEA analyses of AZA
inducible genes identified 80 upregulated gene sets and
52 downregulated gene sets that were common between
the three cancer types (Fig. 1a,b; Fig. S1). These gene sets
could be broadly divided into four categories including
cell cycle control (cell cycle, mitosis, meiosis), DNA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

replication (DNA replication and packaging, transcription),
mRNA splicing and translation, and immune response
(Fig. 1c,d; Table S1a,b). The majority of the immune
gene sets showed upregulation by AZA (15/16 gene sets
or 93.7%) except for the “systemic lupus erythematosus”
gene set, which also showed downregulation (Table
S1a,b). We thus focused the remainder of our analysis on
those immune gene sets that only showed upregulation in
response to AZA.
The abovementioned 15 upregulated immune gene
sets (Fig. 1c) were classified as interferon signaling,
antigen presentation, chemokine and cytokine signaling,
inflammation, and influenza (Fig. 1c, Table 1). These
immune pathways were activated in almost every cell
line in response to AZA and did not cluster with a specific
subtype of cancer (for example, receptor status in breast
cancers, CpG Island Hypermethylator Phenotype (CIMP)
589

[8], or histologic subtype) (Fig. 1e). Overall immune
pathway upregulation was highest in ovarian cancers
(31.3%) followed by breast (16.9%) and colorectal
(14.4%) (Fig. 1f). We compared these 80 upregulated gene
sets from our three cancer types to 14 lung cancer cell lines
that had been treated with the same AZA dosing schedule
[5]. Interestingly, 76/80 (95%) of the gene sets common
to breast, colorectal, and ovarian cell lines (Fig. 1a) were
also upregulated in the lung cancer cell lines. In addition,
23.3% of significantly upregulated pathways in the lung
cancer cell lines were also immune related. This suggested
to us that AZA drives common signaling pathways in many
solid tumor types and immunomodulatory pathways are a
significant fraction of these AZA upregulated pathways.
Immune genes from these 15 common upregulated
immune gene sets characterized by greater than twofold
expression changes were then categorized as an AZA
IMmune Gene set (AIM, Table 1). The expression values
for these AIM genes, comprised of 317 genes from 63
cancer cell lines (breast, colorectal and ovarian) are

shown arranged by the respective immune gene sets (Fig.
S2). The plots detail the cell lines with the greatest gene
expression changes in response to AZA and rectangles
have been placed on these cell lines used for subsequent
validation studies (Fig. S2).
The canonical effects of AZA have been described
as demethylation of promoter regions and subsequent
expression of the silenced gene [9, 10]. Many of the
pathway changes in response to AZA, such as increased
expression of immune genes, may be the result of
downstream events elicited by a small number of hubs
related to promoter DNA demethylation and associated
gene upregulation [11]. We investigated hub networks
in our current pan-cancer analyses by first searching,
in a genome-wide analysis using the Infinium 450K
methylation platform, for genes that have AZA-induced
demethylation of cancer-specific, DNA hypermethylated,
CpG islands associated with proximal promoter regions.
The total number of such demethylated genes in the cell
lines from breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers was

162 (Fig. S3a). A subset of these genes (4.9%) showed
demethylation and reexpression in all three cancer types
including PYCARD, B3GALT4, CARD9, EID3, TSPYL5,
IFF01, FERMT3, and AC5. The highest percentages of
these demethylation and reexpression events were again
seen in immune genes; 26%, of the 162 genes were
categorized as immune related (Fig. S3b,c). Overall
immune gene demethylation and reexpression was again
highest in ovarian cancer cell lines (53.8%) followed by
colorectal (42.8%) and breast (30.7%) cancer cell lines
(Figure S3b). Of note, amongst these 162 genes, 8 (4.9%)
were also in our AIM gene set (BNIP3, HERC5, ICAM1,
IRF7, MX1, MST1R, PSMB8, TCRIG1) with IRF7, a
member of the interferon regulatory factor family of
transcription factors [5, 12] in particular being notable for
being a canonical demethylated and reexpressed gene.

in the array (HCC1569 and ZR751 for breast cancer,
COLO201 and HT29 for colorectal cancer, and A2780 and
TYKNU for ovarian cancer) (Fig. S2). We concentrated on
key genes for individual steps in the associated immune
pathways and especially for the interferon response as
selected by the array data (Fig. 2a, b). Many AIM genes
are part of or downstream of the interferon response
(including antigen presentation and cytokines/chemokines)
[13]. Each chosen gene validated in the qRT-PCR assays
for AZA-induced reexpression (Fig. 2c).
GSEA analysis identified antigen processing and
presentation as key pathways upregulated by AZA (Fig.
1c, Fig. 3a); these are among the interferon regulated genes
in the type I interferon response [14]. Antigens and antigen
presentation genes were upregulated in representative cell
lines from each tumor type and in DKO cells (Fig. 3b).
Upregulation of selected genes was validated by qRT-PCR
(Fig. 3c) and represent regulation by AZA at most every
step of antigen presentation, in all three cancer types (Fig.
3a).
It is especially noteworthy that the DKO cell line

2b, Fig. S2) induces significant upregulation for most
AIM genes (Fig. S4a,c). To determine whether this was
specific to DNMT inhibitors, we also treated cells with
an HDAC inhibitor (TSA) that has been used extensively
in our laboratory. We show that TSA also upregulates
subsets of AIM genes but not as uniformly or robustly
as DKO cells or AZA treated cells (Fig. S4a,b,c). This
activation of AIM genes appears to be in response to
epigenetic agents and not the result of a general cell stress
response that could be elicited by chemotherapeutics such
as carboplatin. Treatment of the ovarian cancer cell line
A2780, for 72 hours with 500 nM carboplatin does not
lead to overexpression of AIM genes IFI27, IRF7, IL15,
or MAGEB2, all of which are increased in AZA-treated
cells (Fig. S4d).
Demethylation and upregulation of cancer testis
antigens by AZA has been previously described [15-18].
Cancer testis antigens are critical to tumor immunology,
but GSEA does not have a well-defined cancer testis
antigen gene list. Thus we created a gene set from the
well-annotated CTdatabase [19] and ran GSEA on the
63 cell lines using the same cutoffs for significance as

in Figure 1. The cancer testis antigens were significantly
enriched in many cell lines, and were only upregulated by
AZA (Fig. S5). The upregulation of cancer testis antigens
was again seen in all three cancer types although this was
more pronounced for colorectal (64.3% of cell lines) and
ovarian (39.1%) and less so for breast (19.2%) cancers.

AIM Gene Signature in Primary Cancers:
It is critical to know how all of the above work
performed in cultured cancer cells may relate to primary
cancers. We thus examined how basal levels of the AIM
genes might reveal clustering of hundreds of primary
samples in publicly available gene expression data sets
from breast [20], colorectal [21], and ovarian [22] cancers
in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) (Fig. 4) (TCGA datasets
included 536 breast, 155/69 colon/rectal and 590 ovarian
cancers, and for GEO the breast, colorectal and ovarian
datasets contained 177,188 and 185 cancers, respectively).
Significantly, each cancer type, in each database, clustered
into sub-groups that have very concordant “low” or “high”

Figure 4: The AIM 317 gene panel clusters TCGA and GEO tumors into high and low immune signatures. Tumors from

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cluster into “high” and “low” immune groups based on the AIM genes. The bars on the far left show
the five sets of AIM genes driving the clustering, interferon, antigen, cytokines/chemokines, inflammation and influenza. The shades of
blue bars at the top denote tumor vs. normal, stage, and receptor status for breast cancer, CIMP, stage, and colon vs rectum for colon/rectum

expression of the 317 AIM genes (Fig. 4). For the TCGA
data, no correlation was observed with clinical stage or
tumor subtype in either breast, colorectal or ovarian
cancers (Fig. 4a,b,c). These clinical parameters were less
well defined in GEO. We also did not see an association
of AIM gene expression with breast cancer subtype (ER+,
HER2+, triple negative) (Fig. 4a,d). Because of the
smaller number of colon cancers in TCGA, both colon
and rectal cancer expression data were combined for the
AIM analysis and we found that there was no distinct
cluster associated with either tissue type (colon or rectal).
However, higher AIM gene expression did appear to
associate with a large percentage of colorectal tumors that
had a high CIMP status [23] (Fig. 4b).
The low basal levels of the AIM genes in primary
cancers of all three types suggests what has been termed
a cancer immune evasion phenotype [24, 25], which
can be reversed by AZA treatment. Our previous data in
NSCLC with a less comprehensively annotated gene set
had also suggested this [5]. We thus examined our AIM
gene panel in the TCGA data set for NSCLC. Remarkably,
TCGA expression data from lung cancers showed similar
clustering of AIM gene sets into a “high” and “low”
expression cluster (Fig. S6a). We examined our AIM

profile in the TCGA melanoma database since excitement
over targeting immune tolerance for solid tumors has been
particularly high for this disease. Again, an intriguing
clustering of AIM gene sets into a “high” and “low”
expression cluster is seen (Fig. S6b).
To address the question of whether AIM genes
are re-expressed in vivo, we queried RNA from patients
with triple negative breast cancer [26] and colorectal
cancer receiving combination epigenetic therapy with
AZA and an HDAC inhibitor, entinostat, with the AIM
panel. We examined biopsies obtained from patients preand post- (8-weeks) epigenetic therapy. GSEA analysis
of expression data from paired patient biopsies revealed
that 32.7% (33/101) of the GSEA gene sets upregulated
in breast cancers were immune related while colorectal
cancers contained 11.9% (56/469) upregulated immune
gene sets (Fig. 5a). Strikingly, of the 15 common
upregulated immune gene sets from the 63 AZA treated
cancer cell lines (Fig. 1c), 11 immune gene sets were
upregulated in biopsies from both breast and colorectal
patients after 8 weeks of therapy. The 317 AIM genes
derived from our cell line experiments were used to query
the expression data from the paired biopsies, and AIM
genes were upregulated by AZA in the post treatment

tissue (Fig. 5b,c). For example, breast cancer patient #5
showed increased expression of AIM genes at 8 weeks of
AZA/entinostat therapy and this increase was maintained,
if not increased, in a 6 month biopsy (Figure 5b). This
patient showed significant fold change expression for
the interferon signaling (α/β and γ) gene sets in the AIM
panel (Fig. 5d). Similarly breast cancer patients 1 and 4
also showed strong increases in the AIM gene panel and
again for interferon signaling expression in response to
combination epigenetic therapy with AZA and entinostat
(Fig. 5b,d). Colorectal cancer patients 2, 5 and 6 showed
increases in AIM gene expression in the 8 week post
biopsy (Fig. 5c) especially for individual AIM gene sets
such as antigen presentation (Fig. 5e).

would then provide a rich roadmap for a biomarker
strategy that might track, and help personalize, such a
scenario. Second, for the above biomarker implications,
although the patient numbers are low and immunotherapy
was not given, we have provided evidence that genes in
our AIM panel are upregulated by epigenetic therapy in
patient tumor biopsy samples for two of the cancer types
studied, breast and colorectal cancer.
A question that remains to be answered in our study
is the role that AZA plays in regulating the observed
changes in gene expression signatures. Classically, this
drug blocks DNA methylation, and this could lead to reexpression of promoter methylated and silenced genes
[1]. While we believe this certainly is contributing to the
immune response observed, most of the AIM genes do not
have canonical CpG island promoters.
Many key pathway changes for anti-tumor
responses, and perhaps most gene expression changes
including AIM genes, may lie downstream of a
hub triggered in a cancer cell by classic promoter
demethylation. Furthermore, for the low AZA doses
employed, we see significant overall DNA demethylation
(Fig. S3) and specific events for key genes in our immune
pathways (Fig. S3). A key example in this work with high
correlation to AIM gene responses and to events in the
interferon pathway in our previous study of NSCLC [5] is
the transcription factor gene, IRF7.
This will especially hold true for the low doses
of AZA that are used in clinical trials with epigenetic
therapy [11]. Low doses of AZA which we have shown are
effective in solid tumors [6] may not reexpress all densely
hypermethylated genes as high doses of demethylating
agents can. Interestingly, most of the immune genes in
our AIM panel do not have CpG island promoters and
the epigenetic mechanism controlling their re-expression
is not clear. However the increase in gene expression
could be related to the scaffolding actions of DNMT1 and
how AZA-induced degradation of this methyltransferase
could affect the binding of other chromatin regulators,
thereby leading to chromatin remodeling and increased
transcription [33]. The targeted role of AZA on degrading
DNMTs is highly reflected in the very similar responses
of these AIM genes to genetic depletion of DNMTs in the
DKO cells (Fig. S4).
Our preclinical studies using AZA initially derived
the AIM gene panel from cultured epithelial cancer cells,
and although it seems likely that the increased immune
signature in patient biopsies treated with AZA/entinostat
is coming from the tumor cells, the immune signature
may also be influenced by drug effects on stroma, and
infiltrating immune cells. HDAC inhibitors have been
shown to have effects on the host immune system [34].
Our preclinical TSA data shows that in epithelial cells
HDAC inhibitors also regulate a significant number of
immune genes. A compelling question remains about the
relative contributions of each drug type to regulation of

DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated a response to an
epigenetic agent, the DNA demethylating drug AZA, in
three common solid tumors. This is an important issue
because AZA is FDA approved for MDS, and given at
low doses which preserve on-target effects and minimize
off-target ones, its promise for efficacy in solid tumors is
emerging [4-6, 11]. In our preclinical studies of cell lines
from breast, colorectal, and ovarian tumors, transient, lowdose AZA alters many pathways key for tumorigenesis
including cell cycle and mitotic pathways [27, 28],
mRNA splicing and translation [29], transcription and
DNA replication [27, 28]. However, the dominant effect
was an upregulation of immunomodulatory pathways. The
importance of these findings to the emerging possibility of
a role for epigenetic therapy for sensitizing patients with
cancer to immunotherapy has been stressed throughout our
manuscript.
Importantly, we have highlighted two ways in which
our cell culture data have key relationships to primary
tumors for not only the three cancer types studied but also
for NSCLC and melanoma. First, the AIM gene panel
we have generated clusters basal expression levels for
hundreds of primary samples across five tumor types and
multiple expression databases into high and low immune
gene expression groups. With the close relationship of
the involved genes to key immune pathways such as
interferon responses to inflammation, viral challenge, etc.,
low levels of the AIM genes represent cancers with what
has been termed an immune evasion signature [24, 25].
In fact, previous studies have described immune enriched
subtypes in several types of solid tumors including triple
negative breast cancer [30], colon cancer [31], and an
“immunoreactive subtype” of serous ovarian carcinoma
[32].
Taken together, these data show that solid tumors
can be described as immune low or immune enriched and
suggests that patients with low expression of immune
AIM genes might benefit most from receiving epigenetic
therapy prior to immunotherapy. Our pan-cancer data

gene expression in epithelial versus host immune cells.
These results suggest why a combination of AZA and an
HDACi, as used in our ongoing NSCLC trials [3, 5], may
be an optimal approach in the clinic.
Our current findings showing a universal
upregulation of immune genes by epigenetic drugs
in multiple solid tumor types indicate a strong
immunomodulatory role for these drugs in cancers. Our
derived AIM gene panel identifies the subset of patients
with a low basal immune gene expression signature that
may derive the greatest benefit from epigenetic priming
for immune therapy.

Patients were recruited to clinical trials
NCT01349959 (breast cancer) and NCT01105377 (colon
cancer). Patients received 40 mg/m^2 5-azacitidine
subcutaneously on days 1-5 and 8-10 and 7 mg oral
entinostat on days 3 and 10. Courses were repeated
every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
or unacceptable toxicity. RNA was isolated from pre(baseline) and post-treatment (8 weeks) biopsies and
analyzed with the Agilent 44K Expression Array.

Bioinformatics

METHODS

All data were analyzed using R: A Language and
Environment for Statistical Computing [35]. Expression
normalization of cell line data was performed using the
package Limma as previously described [9,36]. Data was
normalized within each tumor type (breast, colorectal, and
ovarian). These normalized values were then analyzed
utilizing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis by the Broad
Institute and data packages (C5BP, Reactome, KEGG)
[7]. Pathways enriched with a false discovery rate less
than 0.25 and normalized enrichment score (NES) > 2.15
(upregulated gene sets), or < -2.15 (downregulated gene
sets) were chosen. These criteria represented the ~top 30%
of all upregulated gene sets as determined by the NES
score. Pathways common among breast, colorectal, and
ovarian cancer were identified. Pathways were manually
curated into specific categories. AIMs were defined
by intersection of all genes from the enriched GSEA
gene sets with over 2 fold upregulated genes after AZA
treatment for any cell line, any time point. Genes were
defined as demethylated if they met the following criteria:
had a high basal β value > 0.5 and a ∆β (AZA-Mock) < -0.25,
were expressed at low basal levels in the untreated cells
(lower than 50% of the expression quantile) and expressed
at higher levels in the AZA treated cells (> 2-fold). For
β values, the only gene probes included in the analysis
were those that recognized the CpG island within the
promoter. Demethylated/re-expressed genes had to meet
both demethylation and reexpression criteria at least in
one cell line. TCGA HumanMethylation27K level 3 data
was downloaded, standard deviation of Infinium β-values
across all primary cancer samples were calculated, and
the top one thousand most variable probes were chosen
for hierarchical cluster analysis [23]. Based on the
dendrogram and overall methylation status, primary cancer
samples were classified as CIMP high, CIMP intermediate
and CIMP low.

Cell Line Treatments
63 cell lines (26 breast cancer, 14 colorectal cancer,
23 ovarian cancer) were used in these experiments. Breast
cell lines included BT20, BT474, CAMA1, EFM19,
MDA453, MDA468, MDA361, MCF7, MDA231, T47D,
HCC1500, and HCC1187 obtained from the American
Type Tissue Collection; HCC1419, HCC38, EFM192A,
HCC1569, HCC1937, HCC1954, MDA175, MDA415,
MDA436, SUM149, SUM159, SKBR3, ZR751, and
ZR7530 from Dr. Dennis Slamon. All cells were
maintained under recommended conditions. Colorectal
cell lines were all obtained from the American Type Tissue
Collection and were maintained under recommended
conditions. These included CACO-2, Colo201, Colo205,
Colo320, DLD1, HCT116, HT29, Lovo, RKO, SK-CO1,
SNUC-1, SW48, SW480, and SW620. Ovarian cell lines
were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Dennis Slamon
and included A2780, CAOV3, DOV13, EFO27, ES2, Hey,
HEYC2, Kuramochi, OAW28, OAW42, OV167, OV2008,
OV90, OVCA429, OVCA432, OVMANA, OVCAR3,
OVCAR5, OVKATE, PEO14, SKOV3, TOV112D,
and TykNu; these were maintained under the ATCC
recommended conditions.
Cell lines were treated with 500 nM of AZA or
carboplatin (Sigma; St. Louis, Missouri) for 72 hours
while in log-growth phase, changing the media and drug
every 24 hours for AZA treatment. To select an appropriate
chemotherapy control, the carboplatin dose that had the
similar growth inhibitory effect to 500 nM AZA after 10
days was used to treat the cells. Cells were harvested at 1,
3, 7, 10, 14, 21, or 28 days following initial application
of drug. DNA and RNA were obtained using standard
protocols [6]. RNA from 63 cell lines was sent for the
Agilent 44K Expression Array and DNA from 53 cell lines
was sent for the Illumina 450K Methylation Array [6].

After total cellular RNA was extracted using the
Trizol method (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California),
RNA concentration was determined using the Nanodrop
machine and software (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Rockville, Maryland). 1 µg total RNA was used to
generate cDNA with the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription
Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands). Quantitative reverse
transcription PCR (q-RT-PCR) of CD274, DDX58,
HLA-C, IFI6, IFI27, IL-15, IRF7, IRF9, MAEL, and
MAGEB2 mRNA was performed using TaqMan assays
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) and the Applied
Biosystems 7500 Fast real-time PCR system and software.
Human β-actin mRNA was used as the endogenous control
[37]. The ΔΔCT method was used to calculate relative
expression levels. All qRT-PCR assays were carried out
in triplicate and then repeated with new cDNA synthesis.
Minus RT controls (reverse transcriptase negative cDNA
synthesis reactions) were performed for at least one
sample per plate.
