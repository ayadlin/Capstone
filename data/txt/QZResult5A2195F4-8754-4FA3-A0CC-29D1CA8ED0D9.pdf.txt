Abstract
Androgen receptor (AR) is known to be overexpressed in
castration-resistant prostate cancer. To interrogate the
functional significance of the AR level, we established two
LNCaP cell sublines expressing in a stable fashion two to four
times (LNCaP-ARmo) and four to six times (LNCaP-ARhi)
higher level of AR than the parental cell line expressing the
empty vector (LNCaP-pcDNA3.1). LNCaP-ARhi cell line grew
faster than the control line in low concentrations, especially in
1 nmol/L 5A-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Microarray-based
transcript profiling and subsequent unsupervised hierarchical
clustering showed that LNCaP-ARhi cells clustered together
with VCaP cells, containing endogenous AR gene amplification
and overexpression, indicating the central role of AR in the
overall regulation of gene expression in prostate cancer cells.
Two hundred forty genes showed >2-fold changes on DHT
treatment in LNCaP-ARhi at 4 h time point, whereas only 164
and 52 showed changes in LNCaP-ARmo and LNCaPpcDNA3.1, respectively. Many androgen-regulated genes were
upregulated in LNCaP-ARhi at 10-fold lower concentration of
DHT than in control cells. DHT (1 nmol/L) increased
expression of several cell cycle–associated genes in LNCaPARhi cells. ChIP-on-chip assay revealed the presence of
chromatin binding sites for AR within F200 kb of most of
these genes. The growth of LNCaP-ARhi cells was also highly
sensitive to cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, roscovitine, at
1 nmol/L DHT. In conclusion, our results show that overexpression of AR sensitizes castration-resistant prostate
cancer cells to the low levels of androgens. The activity of
AR signaling pathway is regulated by the levels of both ligand
and the receptor. [Cancer Res 2009;69(20):8141–9]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common male malignancy in many
western countries (1, 2). The growth and the differentiation of
normal prostate epithelial cells as well as development of prostate
cancer are dependent on androgens (3). Androgen ablation, the
gold standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer, initially
inhibits tumor growth but ultimately fails and leads to emergence
of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which has also been

called as androgen-independent prostate cancer. However, a recent
clinical trial on abiraterone indicated directly that CRPC is still
androgen-dependent (4). It has been shown that CRPC cells
upregulate the expression of many of enzymes involved in
steroidogenesis, suggesting that cancer cells themselves produce
androgens during androgen withdrawal (5–7). In addition, the
experimental models of CRPC have shown that many of the
androgen-regulated genes are upregulated in CRPC (8–11).
Androgen action is mediated by the androgen receptor (AR;
ref. 12). It has been shown that AR is overexpressed in vast majority
of CRPC (13, 14). In addition, f30% of CRPC carry AR gene
amplification (15). Somatic mutations of AR in prostate cancer
have also been extensively studied. The mutations seem to be rare
in untreated tumors but are found in 10% to 30% of tumors treated
with antiandrogens, such as flutamide and bicalutamide (16, 17).
Receptor mutations may broaden the ligand specificity converting
even the antagonist effect of antiandrogens to agonist one (10, 18).
It has also been suggested that crosstalk between AR signaling and
other pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, and Akt pathways, takes place,
especially in androgen-depleted environment (12). In addition,
alterations in the expression of AR coregulators have been suggested, but not proven, to be involved in the progression of
prostate cancer (19). Functional evidence that AR is involved in the
emergence of CRPC was presented by Chen and colleagues (20)
who showed that ectopic expression of a high AR content was
sufficient to transform androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells
to androgen-independent ones. Also, Kokontis and colleagues (21)
have shown previously that adaptation of LNCaP cell line to low
levels of androgens is associated with increased expression of endogenous mutant AR. Together with the findings that AR overexpression is common in CRPC, the experimental data suggest that
the overexpression of this receptor is a key mechanism for the
progression of prostate cancer.
To mimic the conditions of high AR expression in CRPC, we have
established a cell line model by a stable transfection of AR into an
androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. Two sublines
with moderate (LNCaP-ARmo) and high (LNCaP-ARhi) levels of AR
overexpression were produced. The model cell lines were
subsequently used to examine the influence of AR levels on cell
growth and expression of downstream genes of the AR signaling
pathway. The aim was to investigate whether AR overexpression
hypersensitizes cells to the low levels of androgens, as we have
suggested previously (15), as well as to identify the candidate
downstream genes that are involved in the emergence of CRPC.

Figure 1. A, relative expression levels of AR
mRNA (AR/TBP) as measured by Q-RT-PCR. The
AR mRNA level is f13 times higher in LNCaPARhi and 4 times higher in LNCaP-ARmo cells
than in controls (parental LNCaP and LNCaPpcDNA3.1). Mean F SE of three replicates.
B, Western analysis of the AR protein levels.
LNCaP-ARhi cells had 4- to 6-fold and LNCaPARmo cells had 2- to 4-fold higher AR protein
levels than control cells (LNCaP and LNCaPpcDNA3.1). Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein levels
were quantified by ImageJ software program and
normalized against pan-actin (loading control).
The combined fold change is also shown.
PC-3 cells were used as a negative control.

Either pcDNA3.1(+) empty expression vector (Invitrogen) or pcDNA3.1(+)
inserted with the AR coding region [accession #_M23263; digested with SalI
and NheI from pSG5 expression vector and subcloned pTarget vector
(Invitrogen) and finally into NotI/BamHI site in pcDNA3.1] were stable
transfected into LNCaP with Lipofectamine Plus transfection reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfected
clones were selected with 400 Ag/mL geneticin (G418; Invitrogen), and
several clones were expanded. AR mRNA level was determined by using
Northern blot analysis and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR
(Q-RT-PCR). Subsequently, dozen clones, showing the highest overexpression of AR mRNA, were analyzed further for their AR protein levels using
Western blotting. Finally, two clones, expressing moderately (LNCaP-ARmo)
and highly (LNCaP-ARhi) increased levels of AR protein, were selected for
further analyses. Cells transfected with an empty vector (LNCaP-pcDNA3.1)
were used as a control. The transfected cells were cultured in medium
containing geneticin (200 Ag/mL). DuCaP and VCaP cells were kindly
provided by Dr. Jack Schalken (Radboud University Nijmegen Medical
Center) and grown under the recommended conditions. LAPC4 cell line was
kindly provided by Dr. Charles Sawyers (Sloan-Kettering Institute) and
cultured under the recommended conditions.
Before each experiment with hormone exposure, cells were grown in
charcoal-stripped serum (CSS; Hyclone) in medium without phenol red for
4 days. Subsequently, the medium was replaced for the experiment with that
containing various concentrations of 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT; Steraloids) or roscovitine (Calbiochem, EMD Chemicals).
Cell proliferation assays. After 3 days of incubation in charcoalstripped serum medium, the cells were trypsinized, counted, and placed in
12-well dishes in charcoal-stripped serum medium with desired concentration of DHT. The amount of cells at each time point was analyzed using
Alamar Blue reagent (AbD Serotec) and luminometric detection using a
fluorometer (Wallac 1420 Victor; Perkin-Elmer). Alternatively, the cells were
trypsinized and the number of cells was calculated with Beckman Coulter
Z2-series particle counter according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Each experiment was done in quadruplicate for DHT-induced growth

analysis and in triplicate for roscovitine exposures. For the relative growth
curves, the luminometric values or the number of the cells in each well in
each follow-up day were divided by the mean values or number at day 1.
Q-RT-PCR. Subconfluent cells were collected from dishes and their total
RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out from total
RNA using AMV reverse transcriptase (Finnzymes) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The primers for Q-RT-PCR were designed with
Primer3 program.3 Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
SYBR Green II-Fast Start kit (Roche Diagnostics) and Light Cycler apparatus
(Roche Diagnostics) were used for Q-RT-PCR essentially as described
previously (13). TBP (TATA box binding protein) mRNA was used as a
reference. The specificity of the reactions was confirmed, in addition to the
melting curve analysis, with 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.
Western blot. The soluble cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were
extracted from subconfluent cells using the modified method of Dignam
and colleagues (22). Both cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (12.5 Ag each)
were separated in 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore). After blocking, membranes were
incubated with the primary antibody (mouse anti-AR 441 and mouse antipan-actin, clone ACTN05; NeoMarkers), washed, and incubated with the
secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate;
DAKO). After washing, the protein bands were visualized on autoradiography film (Kodak) using chemiluminescence detection (Western Blotting
Luminol reagent; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Intensity differences were
quantified by ImageJ image analysis software program.4 Equal loading was
confirmed by staining with antibody against pan-actin.
Microarray analysis. Microarray hybridizations were done in the
Finnish DNA Microarray Centre at Turku Centre for Biotechnology. First,

300 ng total RNA of each sample was transcribed in vitro, biotinylated and
amplified with Illumina RNA TotalPrep Amplification kit (Ambion), and
hybridized to Illumina Sentrix HumanRef-8_V2 Expression BeadChip according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The probes of Illumina HumanRef-8 v2
chip are based on the content from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information RefSeq database 1, release 17 containing >22,000 well-annotated
transcripts. The data were analyzed with GeneSpring Analysis Platform
version GX 7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). First, lowest signal value was set to be
3-fold higher compared with negative control (water) signals. All individual
values below that were set to this lowest signal value.
For unsupervised hierarchical clustering, samples were normalized per
chip by the 50th percentile and per gene by the median. Average linkage
method was used for clustering, and the similarities were estimated with
Pearson’s correlation. For the analyses of DHT dose responses, data were
normalized with repeated median polishing per chip and gene. Subsequently, signal values in each treatment were divided by the signal value of
the 0 nmol/L DHT treatment of the same cell line at the same time point.
To identify differently expressed genes in the faster-growing LNCaP-ARhi
cells at 1 nmol/L DHT, the data were normalized with intensity dependent
Lowess normalization. Twenty percent of the data were used to calculate
the Lowess fit at each point. This curve was used to adjust the control value
(LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 or LNCaP-ARmo were used as control samples for
LNCaP-ARhi) for each measurement. For ontology classifications, all gene
ontology lists containing at least 10 genes with P < 0.001 (hypergeometric
P value without multiple testing correction) in either LNCaP-pcDNA3.1, or

LNCaP-ARmo, or LNCaP-ARhi were filtered and organized with GeneSpring
Ontology browser.
The array data were submitted using MIAMExpress to the ArrayExpress
database (accession number E-MEXP-2286).
ChIP-on-chip assays. ChIP-on-chip assays were done with anti-AR antibody (BJ14-AR3; ref. 23) in nontransfected LNCaP-1F5 cells that were cultured in the absence of hormone for 4 days and then exposed to 100 nmol/L
DHT or vehicle for 2 h. The immunoprecipitation enriched and input
chromatin samples were amplified by ligation-mediated PCR followed by
fragmentation and labeling of DNA. Three micrograms of samples from
input and immunoprecipitated samples were hybridized to Affymetrix
whole-genome tiling arrays (GeneChip Human Tiling 2.OR Array Set;
Affymetrix). The regions enriched for AR-binding sites were identified by
MAT algorithm (24) and mapped to the most recent human genome
sequence (Hg18), and sites that were enriched above input were scored at a
P value of 10 4. These AR-binding sites were then subsequently mapped to
the differentially expressed genes in the AR overexpression model.

Results
Establishment of AR-overexpressing LNCaP. Two AR-overexpressing clones were selected for experiments. These were
LNCaP-ARmo, with f4-fold higher AR mRNA and f2- to 4-fold
higher AR protein level, and LNCaP-ARhi, with 13-fold higher AR

Figure 3. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of mRNA expression in DHT-treated LNCaP-AR and VCaP cells. LNCaP-ARhi cells cluster together with VCaP cells
(except 0 mol/L DHT treated), and LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 cells together with LNCaP-ARmo cells.

mRNA and 4- to 6-fold higher AR protein level, than those in the
control LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 cells (Fig. 1). Immunofluorescence
staining showed that the AR protein is located in nucleus when
cells are grown in the presence of androgens (Supplementary
Fig. S1). In addition, overexpression of AR seemed to enhance
the nuclear transport after DHT exposure. The most intense
nuclear staining was seen in the LNCaP-ARhi cells after 1 h exposure
to 10 nmol/L DHT.
Growth curve analyses. The proliferation rates of these cells
were analyzed in the presence of various DHT concentrations. The
growth of LNCaP-ARhi cells was stimulated with lower concentrations of DHT than control LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 or LNCaP-ARmo
cells (Fig. 2). Especially, in the presence of 1 nmol/L DHT, LNCaPARhi cells grew clearly faster than LNCaP-ARmo or LNCaPpcDNA3.1 cells (P < 0.01). The cells overexpressing AR were also
capable of growing better in charcoal-stripped serum medium
without DHT (Fig. 2E). However, the growth finally plateaued in all
cell lines.
Expression profiling. For genome-wide expression profiling,
LNCaP-ARhi, LNCaP-ARmo, and LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 cells were
grown in the presence of various DHT concentrations (0, 1, 10,
and 100 nmol/L), and total RNA was extracted at 4 and 24 h time

points. In addition, VCaP cells that contain endogenous AR gene
amplification and strong overexpression of AR (ref. 24; Fig. 1) were
treated and analyzed in a similar fashion. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of androgen-regulated transcripts revealed that VCaP
and LNCaP-ARhi cells clustered together, whereas androgendependent transcripts of LNCaP-ARmo cells clustered together
with those of LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 cells (Fig. 3).
More genes were upregulated than downregulated in the LNCaPAR cells by DHT. Venn diagrams for upregulated and downregulated genes are shown in Fig. 4. In LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 cells,
expression of 52 and 118 genes was changed >2-fold at any DHT
concentration compared with vehicle at 4 and 24 h, respectively. In
LNCaP-ARmo and LNCaP-ARhi, the number of genes with altered
expression was higher; in ARmo 164 and 379 at 4 and 24 h time
points, respectively, and in ARhi 240 and 475 at 4 and 24 h time
points, respectively (P < 0.0001, m2 test). In VCaP cells, expression
of 430 genes was changed >2-fold at the 4 h time point and 428
genes at the 24 h time point. The upregulated and downregulated
genes by DHT exposure in LNCaP-pcDNA3.1, LNCaP-ARmo,
LNCaP-ARhi, and VCaP are listed in Supplementary Tables S2 to S5.
Next, we analyzed gene ontology categories for all genes
upregulated and downregulated at 24 h of DHT treatments. In

LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 cells, DHT upregulated transcripts belonged to
the following five gene ontology categories (at least 10 upregulated
genes with P < 0.001): intracellular signaling cascade, cell cycle, cell
division, protein metabolism, and DNA metabolism (Supplementary Table S6). In LNCaP-ARhi and LNCaP-ARmo cells, the same
five gene ontology categories were also upregulated as those in
LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 cells, but the number of upregulated genes was
significantly higher in each category. In addition, six other main
ontologies were enriched in LNCaP-ARmo and/or LNCaP-ARhi
cells. These categories were lipid metabolism, secretory pathway,
cell organization and biogenesis, chromosome segregation, response to endogenous stimulus, and cell proliferation (Supplementary Table S6). Ontologies that showed highly significantly (P <
0.0001, m2 test) more upregulated genes in LNCaP-ARhi cells
compared with LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 or LNCaP-ARmo cells were genes
associated with mitotic cell cycle, regulation of progression through
cell cycle, organelle organization and biogenesis, cellular protein
metabolism, and DNA metabolism (Supplementary Table S6). Of
upregulated ontologies, intracellular signaling cascade, cell cycle,
and lipid metabolism were also upregulated significantly (P < 0.01)
already at 4 h time point. Only one ontology category, apoptosis, was
significantly upregulated at 4 h time point but not at 24 h time point.
The downregulated genes were not enriched in any of the categories
with more than two genes in any of the cell lines.
When upregulated ontologies were examined separately at various DHT concentrations (Fig. 5), particularly DNA metabolism, cell
cycle, cell organization and biogenesis, cell division, and intracel-

lular signaling cascade were found to be highly significantly
upregulated in LNCaP-ARhi cells already in 1 nmol/L DHT
concentration (Fig. 5A). At 10 and 100 nmol/L DHT concentrations,
the same ontologies were upregulated but with higher number of
genes. At 10 and 100 nmol/L DHT concentrations, cell cycle, DNA
metabolism, lipid metabolism, cell organization and biogenesis, cell
division, and chromosome segregation were highly significantly
upregulated also in LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 or LNCaP-ARmo cells. The
number of upregulated genes in these categories were, however,
always highest in LNCaP-ARhi cells. The most significantly
upregulated ontologies in LNCaP-ARmo cells were lipid metabolism and secretory pathway.
Expression of known AR target genes. Expression of wellknown AR target genes, such as PSA, TMPRSS2, NKX3-1, and
TMEPAI, was found to be increased by 4- to 10-fold in LNCaP-ARhi
and LNCaP-ARmo compared with LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 at 4 and 24 h time
points (Fig. 6). Likewise, expression of well-known downregulated
AR target genes, such as PAP and PSMA, was attenuated more in
LNCaP-ARhi and LNCaP-ARmo cells than in control cells. On
average, for an equal level of upregulation of genes, a 10-fold higher
DHT concentration was required for LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 cells than for
LNCaP-ARhi or LNCaP-ARmo cells. Q-RT-PCR of PSA and six
selected genes, unknown previously to be regulated by androgens,
confirmed the microarray data (Supplementary Fig. S2).
LNCaP and VCaP cells contain genetic rearrangements affecting
Ets transcription factors, ETV1 and ERG, respectively (25, 26). In
VCaP cells, ERG expression was upregulated by androgens

(Supplementary Fig. S3). Unfortunately, Illumina RefSeq8-v2 probes
for ETV1 failed to detect any expression. However, Q-RT-PCR
analysis showed >2-fold increase of ETV1 mRNA (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Of Ets family members, only ELK4 mRNA level was increased with androgens in LNCaP-ARhi cells at 24 h time point
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The ELK4 gene is known to be an AR
target in human prostate cancer cells with association to cell growth
in vitro (27).
Kokontis and colleagues (21) have shown previously that LNCaP
cells overexpressing endogenous AR show higher expression of
MYC in low levels of androgens, and the expression is decreased in
lower concentrations of the androgens than in the parental cell
line. In similar fashion, here the highest MYC expression was found
in VCaP and LNCaP-ARhi cells in the low DHT levels, and the

expression was decreased in higher concentrations of DHT
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
Identification of candidate AR downstream genes. Because
the LNCaP-ARhi cells gained a growth benefit in vitro with 1 nmol/L
DHT concentration compared with LNCaP-ARmo cells or empty
vector–transfected LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 cells, we were particularly
interested in the genes that are upregulated or downregulated in
LNCaP-ARhi cells at 1 nmol/L DHT. Expression of 173 genes were
found to be altered >2-fold (127 upregulated and 46 downregulated)
in LNCaP-ARhi cells and compared with LNCaP-pcDNA3.1
or LNCaP-ARmo cell at 24 h after DHT exposure (Supplementary
Table S7). Of these genes, we examined whether any of the
upregulated genes were expressed in VCaP cells to the same
or higher level than in LNCaP-ARhi cells. Ninety-nine such genes

were found (Supplementary Table S8), and 66 of those were also >2fold upregulated with 1.0 nmol/L DHT compared with vehicletreated LNCaP-ARhi cells. The expression of 56 of these 66 genes
were also >1.5-fold upregulated by DHT already at 4 h time point in
LNCaP-ARhi. These genes were determined using Oncomine
Research Edition.5 Almost all of them (51 of 56, 91%) showed
significantly upregulated expressions in prostate cancer, at least, in
one of the data sets, and 49 of 56 (88%) genes were upregulated, at
least, in two independent sets in metastasized prostate cancer
compared with primary prostate cancers (Supplementary Table S9).
ChIP-on-chip analysis of genome-wide AR binding in LNCaP-1F5
cells after a 2 h DHT exposure indicated that a majority of these 56

genes (34 of 56, 61%) possessed AR-binding site within a 200-kb
window from transcription start sites of the genes (Supplementary
Table S9). Two of 34 had an AR-binding site in the proximal
promoter, 15 of 34 had an AR-binding site within -100 kb upstream
of transcription start site, and 16 of 34 had AR-binding sites
downstream of transcription start site. Eight of 34 had AR-binding
site both upstream and downstream of transcription start site. The
androgen response elements within the AR-binding sites were
analyzed using MotifMatch (28). Using a high cutoff score of 9 and
with a strict 3-bp spacing for typical class I canonical androgen
response element (AGAACAnnnTGTTCT), we could find a
canonical androgen response element in following genes: NDC80,
NCAPG, FANCI, C12orf48, PRIM1, IQGAP3, KIF20A, CDC2, HMGB2,
SPAG5, TK1, PRC1, MCM4, and PCNA.

Effect of roscovitine on growth of LNCaP-AR cells. Because
the expression of both CDC2 (alias CDK1) and CDK2 were increased in 1 nmol/L DHT, especially in LNCaP-ARhi, and the genes
have AR-binding site according to ChIP-on-chip data, the effect of
CDK1/2 inhibition was tested. The growth of LNCaP sublines was
assayed in different concentrations of CDK1/2 inhibitor roscovitine
and DHT. The growth of LNCaP-pcDNA3.1, LNCaP-ARmo, and
LNCaP-ARhi cells was significantly (P < 0.001, unpaired two-tailed
t test) inhibited with 15 Amol/L roscovitine in 10 nmol/L DHT
(Supplementary Fig. S5). The LNCaP-ARhi cells showed the growth
inhibition also by 7.5 Amol/L roscovitine (P = 0.0002). In addition, the
growth of LNCaP-ARhi (P = 0.0253), but not LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 or
LNCaP-ARmo, was suppressed by roscovitine in 1 nmol/L DHT.

Discussion
AR is a key protein in both development and progression of
prostate cancer. It is expressed in almost all prostate carcinomas
from the beginning of the disease to the castration-resistant stage
(8, 13, 14). The standard treatment of advanced prostate cancer is
hormone ablation. Although androgen withdrawal attenuates ARmediated signaling and initially prevents tumor growth, several
changes occur in AR action during the treatment that lead to
reactivation of AR signaling and eventually to emergence of the
lethal form of the disease, the CRPC (12). One of the key mechanisms in the emergence of CRPC is amplification of the AR gene
leading to overexpression of AR protein (13, 15). This suggests that
CRPC cells are not androgen-independent but may be hypersensitive
to low androgen level. To study the functional consequences of AR
overexpression and the role of the AR level in more detail, we generated
two LNCaP cell lines that overexpressed AR to different levels.
AR overexpression seemed to increase the ability of prostate
cancer cells to grow and proliferate in the absence of or at a low
concentration of DHT. The level of AR affected the growth in
different androgen concentrations. The LNCaP-ARhi cells with the
highest level of AR expression had the fastest growth rate, whereas
the growth of LNCaP-ARmo cells was between that of the LNCaPARhi and the control cells (LNCaP-pcDNA3.1). Both LNCaP-ARhi
and LNCaP-ARmo were also able to grow longer in the medium
without androgens. Instead, control cell proliferation ceased after
the first week. The data indicate that increased expression of AR
sensitized the growth of the cells to low hormone concentrations.
Even a modest increase in AR expression level can help tumor cells
to proliferate at a low androgen concentration as has also been
suggested previously by Chen and colleagues (20). Kokontis and
colleagues (21) have shown previously that androgens have
biphasic effect on the growth of LNCaP cells. Androgens stimulate
the growth, but in higher concentrations the induction of
proliferation is diminished. In addition, they showed that, in the
LNCaP cells overexpressing endogenous AR on adaptation to
growth in low levels of androgens, the repression of proliferation
takes place in lower androgen levels than in parental cell lines. Here,
we found similar AR level-dependent biphasic effect of androgens
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Thus, the optimal level of growth induction is dependent on the level of both ligand and the receptor.
Several microarray studies have addressed androgen regulation
of gene expression in LNCaP cells (20, 29, 30). However, the data in
these studies are only partially concordant. Reasons for the
discrepant findings could be different time points used, different
ligands, different ligand concentrations, and heterogeneity of the
LNCaP cells themselves in different laboratories. For example, in

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (20). October 15, 2009

our data, several genes, such as TNFRSF10B, APRIN, TNFAIP3, and
SGK, which were upregulated strongly at the 4 h time point,
showed very little, if any, upregulation anymore at 24 h. An
important aspect is also that AR in the parental LNCaP cells is
mutated allowing other steroids and even antiandrogens, such as
flutamide, function as agonist (18). To alleviate these problems, we
transfected wild-type AR cDNA into LNCaP cells and used the
natural ligand at two different time points with four different
concentrations. In our experimental model, we cannot fully separate
the effect of wild-type and mutated AR. However, at least in LNCaPARmo and LNCaP-ARhi cells, the majority of AR is wild-type. Thus,
the differences between these two sublines can be assumed to be due
to the different levels of the expression of wild-type AR.
In our models, the number of androgen-responsive genes was
clearly associated with AR expression level. LNCaP-ARhi cells possessed more androgen-responsive genes than LNCaP-ARmo cells
that, in turn, had more those genes than LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 cells. We
analyzed also VCaP cells, which contain high-level amplification of
the AR gene leading to strong (up to 12-fold) overexpression of AR
protein (ref. 24; Fig. 1). Its growth is androgen-sensitive (31).
Interestingly, the number of the androgen-responsive genes in VCaP
cells was even higher than in LNCaP-ARhi. In unsupervised
hierarchical clustering, VCaP and LNCaP-ARhi cells clustered together
despite that they are different cell lines with different genetic
backgrounds. This indicates a very strong influence of AR to the
genome-wide expression of prostate cancer cells. Of the well-known
androgen-regulated genes, such as PSA and TMPRSS2, induction of
gene expression took place at a 10-fold lower concentrations of DHT in
LNCaP-ARhi and LNCaP-ARmo cells than in LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 cells.
Thus, it seems that the level of AR sensitizes the cells to androgens not
only in terms of growth but also by increasing number of genes
responding to DHT.
Because the growth advantage in LNCaP-ARhi cells was
especially prominent at 1 nmol/L DHT, we were interested in
genes whose expression was altered at that concentration. Because
VCaP cells are also androgen-sensitive and contain AR gene amplification, we postulated that androgen target genes that are important
for progression of CRPC should be detected in both LNCaP-ARhi and
VCaP cells. All in all, 56 genes were induced in 1 nmol/L DHT in
LNCaP-ARhi (but not in LNCaP-ARmo or LNCaP-pcDNA3.1) already
at 4 h and were also highly expressed in VCaP. According to Oncomine data resource, 51 of 56 (91%) of these genes have been shown to
exhibit significant upregulation in primary prostate cancer and/or
metastatic prostate cancer samples (Supplementary Table S9).
Unfortunately, the Oncomine data from studies comparing directly
hormone-naive and castration-resistant cancers were not available for
all of those genes. The list of genes consists of cell cycle genes, for
example, CDK1, CDK2, cyclin B, cyclin E, and aurora kinase A and B. All
of them are known to have an effect on cell proliferation or
chromosome condensation and be upregulated in prostate cancer.
ChIP-on-chip assay revealed that the majority (61%) of these genes have
AR-binding sites within a 200-kb window from transcription start sites.
Our experiments with roscovitine, a CDK1/2 inhibitor, showed that
LNCaP-ARhi cells were more sensitive to the inhibition than the
LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 and LNCaP-ARmo, indicating the importance of
these androgen-regulated genes for the growth benefit of the ARoverexpressing cells. Because it has been shown previously that
CDK1 phosphorylates and stabilizes AR (32), there may be a positive
feedback mechanism between expression of AR and CDK1.
Previous studies have shown that increased AR expression is
associated with the growth of castration-resistant cancers and with

transformation of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells to
androgen-independent ones (10, 20, 21). In addition, association of
AR expression level with cell invasion has also been suggested (11).
These studies have been performed with different cell lines or
xenograft models. In our LNCaP-AR model cells, high AR level was
significantly associated with increased proliferation at a low androgen concentration and with an increased number of genes being
associated to cell cycle and DNA replication. The finding that only
LNCaP-ARhi cells showed the growth advance, and high number of
cell proliferation associated genes that were androgen-responsive, is
in good agreement with observations that clinical CRPC often have
>10-fold overexpression of AR (13, 14).
The results also indicated that AR can have an effect on different
cellular processes depending on the receptor level. In LNCaP-ARmo
cells, the number of responding genes associated with cell cycle
was not increased; instead, genes in other ontology categories, such
as lipid, sterol, and cholesterol biosynthesis, were highly significantly enriched. For example, the androgen-regulated lipid metabolism genes reviewed by Chen and colleagues (33) were all
androgen-regulated, at least, in one of the cell line used in our data.
Of those lipid metabolism genes, especially DHCR24, FASN,
HMGCS1, LDLR, PPAP2A, and SCAP were strongly androgenupregulated in LNCaP-ARmo. Also, the ontology category of secretory
pathway, including endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport genes,
showed higher number of responsive genes in LNCaP-ARmo
compared with LNCaP-ARhi. These observations suggest that the
amount of AR may also have other effects rather than simple
sensitization of cells to lower levels of androgens.

In conclusion, increased expression of AR seems to sensitize
prostate cancer cells in multiple ways and give them several
biological benefits during hormone ablation. High AR protein level
helped the cells to sustain and increase their proliferation in environment with no androgen or a low androgen concentration. Microarray analyses of AR-regulated genes gave further evidence for the
biological benefits of AR overexpression. They showed enhanced
expression of several cell cycle–associated genes at 1 nmol/L DHT,
especially in LNCaP-ARhi cells. In addition, expression of genes
associated with biosynthesis of lipids and other cellular structures
was elevated in LNCaP-ARhi cells. AR expression level seemed also to
predict the activity of AR; the more AR expression, the more
androgen responsive genes. Further studies are warranted to
investigate whether the genes upregulated at low androgen
concentrations could functions as drug targets for CRPC treatment.
