ABSTRACT
We defined the stem cell profile of K562 line, demonstrating the expression of
the Embryonic Transcription Factors Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and Nanog. This profile was
associated with a high vulnerability to the physiological oxidizable substrate pyruvate.
remarkably, this substrate was shown to be innocuous, even at the highest doses,
to normal differentiated cells. This vulnerability is based on a complex metabolic
trim centered on the cellular redox state expressed by the NADP/NADPH ratio
geared by the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Flow cytometry revealed that the
inhibition of this chain by antimycin A produced cell accumulation in the S phase of
cell cycle and apoptosis. This block negatively interferes with the aerobic synthesis of
purines, without affecting the anaerobic synthesis of pyrimidines. This imbalance was
reproduced by using two antifolate agents, LY309887 and raltitrexed (TDX), inhibitors
of purine or pyrimidine synthesis, respectively. All this revealed the apparent paradox
that low doses of TDX stimulated, instead of inhibiting, leukemia cell growth. This
paradox might have significant impact on therapy with regard to the effects of TDX
during the intervals of administration, when the drug concentrations become so low
as to promote maintenance of dormant cancer cells in hypoxic tissue niches.

cells (ESC) [6] within the bulk of highly anaplastic tumors
of any hystogenesis whatever [3, 4]. These cells can be
identified from their expression of embryonic transcription
factors (ETF), whose physiological role is the silencing
of differentiation genes, and thus the maintenance of the
undifferentiated embryonic state [7–11]. ESC originate at
the gastrula stage under hypoxic conditions and migrate
into adult tissues, becoming the adult stem cells after
drastically reducing their self-renewal and plasticity. The
ectopic finding of ESC in an adult tissue is now regarded as
a potential warning that a cancer is about to begin or return,
while the presence of ESC within a tumour is a crucial sign
of severe anaplasia [12–14].

INTRODUCTION
Modern cancer chemotherapy include agents which
interfere with intricate fundamental metabolic networks
[1, 2]. The fact that these networks are often not thoroughly
defined may make it difficult to predict the effects of a
therapeutic strategy. A further difficulty derives from the
necessity of exploring the effects of therapeutic agents
in hypoxia, because cancer stem cells have a tendency to
adapt to, and survive in, these environmental conditions
[3, 4], implying high resistance to radio- and chemotherapy [5]. Recently, crucial information in this field has
been obtained with the identification of embryonic stem

Metabolic studies [3, 4, 15] carried out in our
laboratory employing the highly anaplastic Yoshida’s
ascites hepatoma AH130 cells revealed the basis of
cancer adaptation to hypoxia. We demonstrated that the
very same metabolic features responsible for this process
are accompanied by the susceptibility to a powerful
cytotoxic effect exploited by physiological factors,
such as pyruvate, tetrahydrofolate (FH4) and glutamine.
This paradox is also found in human anaplastic tumors
with a totally different histogenesis, and reflects a
complex metabolic interference of these agents with
purine metabolism. This interference culminates in
the impairment of the amplification of the purine base
pools which is required to fulfil the G1/S transition of
cell cycle. Such an impairment implies an inadequate
mitochondrial apparatus, like that characterizing the
hypoxia-adapted cells surviving in the dormant state
by means of a glycolysis-oriented metabolism [15,
16]. This trim was first discovered by Warburg in 1923
in cancer cells, describing the aerobic glycolysis: this
metabolic pathway consists of the arrest of aerobic
utilization of glucose at the level of pyruvate, which is
mostly exported upon reduction to lactate [15, 17, 18].

This is a tremendous waste of the energy which could be
produced by the aerobic degradation of glucose to H2O
and CO2 through the Krebs cycle and the mitochondrial
respiratory chain. We demonstrated that in this metabolic
configuration the addition of an excess of pyruvate will
lead to the saturation of respiratory chain at the expense
of the re-oxidation of crucial cytosolic dehydrogenation
steps geared by the NADP/NADPH ratio [3, 4]. Indeed,
the reducing equivalent (H+ or electrons) derived from
these dehydrogenations cannot be disposed of through
the metabolic shuttles [19] leading to the respiratory
chain (see Scheme 1). This sequence will inhibit the
growth of any type of anaplastic cancer, through a
ten-fold reduction of the cellular NADP/NADPH
ratio, that is, at the same level in anaerobiosis as in the
presence of antimycin A, a powerful specific inhibitor
of the respiratory chain [4, 15]. The pyruvate inhibition
is removed by the addition of preformed purine bases
(adenine or guanine) as well as by folate (F), indicating
that its mechanism is mediated by the impairment of the
NADP-dependent dehydrogenation of methylen-FH4
(CH2-FH4) to methenyl-FH4 (CH-FH4), catalyzed by the
CH2-FH4-dehydrogenase [3, 4, 19].

Scheme 1: Role of the cellular redox state in the control of purine synthesis. The core of this metabolic network is the

cell redoxstate expressed by the cytosolic NADP/NADPH ratio. This ratio regulates the transfer of reducing equivalents (H+) from the
methylen-tetrahydro-folate (CH2-FH4) to methenyl-tetrahydro-folate (CH-FH4). This NADP-dependent reaction (generating NADPH) is a
limiting step of the synthesis of purine ring required for the amplification of purine pools indispensable for G1-S transition. A fundamental
role in the regulation of NADP/NADPH ratio is played by folate, whose anaerobic reduction to FH4 by dehydrofolate-reductase (DHFR)
generates NADP, compensating the anaerobic restriction of this factor. Whatever the mechanism increasing cytosolic NADPH, including
pyruvate, glutamine through the glutaminolytic pathway, or the inhibition of DHFR by an excess of FH4, the cytosolic NADPH increase
has an inhibitory effect on cell recruitment into S, unless it is removed by the shuttle mechanisms, which discharge the cytosolic reducing
equivalents onto the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This role of the shuttles accounts for the fact that the activity of the chain is crucial
for the G1/S transition, which is impaired by a specific inhibitor like antimycin A or by anaerobiosis. A similar inhibition can be brought
about out in air whenever the chain, although not inhibited, is saturated by reducing equivalents produced by oxidizable substrates of the
Krebs cycle, mostly pyruvate. This inhibitory effect of pyruvate accounts for the crucial role of its disposal of by the reduction to lactate,
and the consequent exportation into the environment, in hypoxia-adapted cancer cells in air (the aerobic glycolysis, traditionally named the
Warburg’s effect).

In the present study, we tested the antitumor activity
of pyruvate on Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) cells
of the K562 stabilized line [20]. A high percentage of
these cells expresses ETF and exhibited a high sensitivity
to pyruvate. Thus, K562 cells turned out to be suitable
for establishing whether and how much CML is subjected
to the same metabolic network previously described
in Yoshida’s hepatoma cells [3, 4]. We answered to
these questions positively, taking advantage of two
antifolate selective inhibitors of the synthesis of purine
or pyrimidine DNA precursors, such as LY309887
[21, 22] and raltitrexed (TDX) [22], respectively. These
compounds  display potent activity against human
leukemia cells [23–26], and may turn out to be effective
agents for the clinical treatment of leukemia [27].
LY309887 is a folate analogue that selectively inhibits
glycinamide-ribonucleotide-formyl-transferase (GARFT)
[28], while TDX selectively targets thymidylate-synthase
(TS) [29]. Our experiments revealed that the reductive
shift of the hypoxic NADP/NADPH ratio determines the
imbalance of the purine/pyrimidine ratio, altering the
correct base assembly into DNA by DNA-polymerase.
These results made it possible to observe and explain

the apparent paradox that, in hypoxic conditions, low
concentrations of TDX stimulate, instead of inhibiting,
K562 cell growth.

RESULTS
The pluripotent stem cell profile of the K562 cell
line: ETF expression
Fig. 1 shows that up to 60–70% of the K562 cell
population expresses four fundamental ETF, such as
Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and Nanog. These ETF are so crucial
for the maintenance of the ESC undifferentiated phenotype
that their transfection is sufficient to reprogram adult
differentiated cells, of any histogenesis whatever, down to
the pluripotent state [8, 9]. We previously found that ETF
expression in tumors is associated with vulnerability to
pyruvate, a phenomenon which represents the hallmark of
the adaptation of ESC to hypoxia, and that the detrimental
effect of pyruvate on cell number in culture increases in
proportion to the level of tumor anaplasia, being maximal
for AH130 cells [3, 4]. The underlying metabolic scenario
was deepened as described hereunder.

K562 cell growth inhibition by pyruvate or in
hypoxia and the effects of folate addition

shortage in the absence of medium renewal. When cultures
were incubated in hypoxia, cell growth was abolished
[30–34]. Fig. 2C shows that, at day 21 of incubation in
hypoxia but not in air, folate addition markedly increased
the total cell number in comparison to the value obtained
for the respective untreated control. It is worth noting
that relatively low concentrations of folate determined a
maximal increase of cell number in hypoxia-incubated
cultures.

Fig. 2A shows that pyruvate concentrationdependently reduced K562 cell number in day-7 cultures
incubated in air. Thus, K562 cells seem sensitive to
pyruvate similarly to AH130 cells. This similarity allows
allows to evaluate K562 cells with respect to the metabolic
analysis performed on AH130 cells. As summarized in
the Introduction, the pyruvate inhibition of cell growth
is removed by the addition of purine bases or folate to
cultures. On this basis, we determined the effects of folate
on the growth kinetics of K562 cells incubated in air or
severe hypoxia (0.1% O2 in the incubation atmosphere). In
air, the cell population grew up to 9 × 105 cells/ml at day 7
and declined thereafter to reach a steady-state at about
4–5 × 105 cells/ml at days 14–21 (Fig. 2B). This decline
is due to cell crowding, with the consequent nutrient

Effects of antimycin A on the cytosolic NADP/
NADPH ratio in K562 cells
Fig. 3 shows that the treatment with antimycin A
(6 × 10−6M), an inhibitor of complex III of mitochondrial
respiratory chain, of cultures incubated in air for 4 days
produced a drastic reductive shift (Fig. 3A), resulting in
a marked decrease of the NADP/NADPH ratio (Fig. 3B).

Effects of purine synthesis inhibition and
adenine on the total number and cell cycle
distribution of K562 cells

We had previously shown that this shift is abolished by
folate addition [4] through the reaction F + NADPH →
FH4 + NADP. Provided folate is abundant, this anaerobic
reaction supplies the NADP necessary for the activity
of cytosolic dehydrogenases, including CH2-FH4dehydrogenase, which allows purine synthesis in hypoxia
[4] (see Scheme 1). Altogether, these data suggested that
K562 cell recruitment into the cycling state is geared by
the NADP/NADPH ratio as a function of respiratory chain
activity or folate supply.

LY309887, a specific inhibitor of purine synthesis,
markedly reduced the total number of cells at day 7 of
incubation in air (Fig. 5A), well in keeping with the
effects of antimycin A shown above. Such a reduction was
abolished by the addition of adenine to LY309887-treated
cultures. These effects are also evident from Fig. 5B–5E,
which shows that the cell cycle distribution changes
induced by the inhibitor at day 4 (D vs C) were abolished
in the presence of adenine (E). This effect implies that the
endogenous pyrimidine pool is per se able to sustain K562
cell growth, once the insufficient endogenous purine pool
is amplified by the addition of adenine.

Effects of antimycin A on total number and cell
cycle distribution of K562 cells
Fig. 4A shows that cell growth occurring in air was
markedly inhibited following antimycin A addition. This
inhibition was apparently independent of the stabilization
of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF), which is driven via the
activation of specific sensors of low oxygen tension [35].
The effects of antimycin A on cell cycle, as determined by
flow cytometry, are shown in Fig. 4B–4F. In control cultures,
when cell population attains the steady state (C, D), cell
percentage progressively increases in the G1 phase of cell
cycle and decreases in S, undergoing evident apoptosis at
day 7 (D). In antimycin A-treated cultures, a marked cell
accumulation in S was already evident at day 4 (E), followed
by a further increase and massive apoptosis at day 7 (F).
Thus, the antimycin A block of respiratory chain interfered
with cell transition through cell cycle. These data are very
similar to those reported by Hastak [36], showing that the
imbalance of pyrimidine pools by N-(phosphonacetyl)L-aspartate (PALA) produces base misincorporation into
DNA during the first S phase, which is sufficient to bring
about cell death during the second cell cycle.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Effects of antimycin A on the A/T and G/C ratios
The above data must be interpreted in the light
of the available information about the close association
between DNA synthesis and turnover and the balance of
various deoxy-nucleotide-triphosphate (dNTP) pools [36].
It is because of this close association that any imbalance
between purines and pyrimidines will produce a high ratio
of base misincorporation of these precursors into DNA,
generating mutations. Up to a certain limit, these mutations
can be repaired by an efficient p53, whereas they induce
cell apoptosis when the DNA “house keeper” is deleted.
We found that p53 is totally deleted in K562 as well as
AH130 cells [3], implying that in these cells any serious
alteration of the purine/pyrimidine ratio, such as that
caused by a restricted purine synthesis or the impairment
of respiratory chain by pyruvate or antimycin A [3, 4, 15],

will promote lethal apoptosis. Consistently, as shown in
Fig. 6A, antimycin A brought about a 14-fold decrease
of the adenine/thymine ratio (A/T) in AH130 cells,
whereas it only halved the guanine/cytosine ratio (G/C).
This indicates that antimycin A determined a major effect
on the purine pool (adenine and guanine), with a minor
effect on the pyrimidine pool (thymine and cytosine). This
conclusion was confirmed by the experiments reported
in Fig. 6B, which shows the concentration/response
relationship of the artificial amplification (at time 0 of
incubation) of the purine or pyrimidine pools to K562 cell
number (at day 7) in the presence of antimycin A. Purines
determined an increase of cell number by up to almost
60%, while pyrimidines produced only negative effects.
Purine addition determined an increase up to 0.25 mM
and a marked decline at higher concentrations. Pyrimidine
addition determined a decrease of K562 cell number over
the whole range of concentrations (0–0.30 mM).
These results led us to draw the following
inferences: a) the purine pools are made deficient by
the block of respiratory chain (antimycin A), accounting
for the reduction of cell number in culture with respect
to control; this reduction is reverted by base addition;
beyond a well-defined limit, the increase of purine pools
becomes detrimental, despite a good adenine/guanine
balance; this limit is evidently attained when the ratio
purine/pyrimidine is optimal; b) the pyrimidine pools are
optimal, or at least sufficient, for maximal growth in the
presence of antimycin A, so that their further amplification
is only detrimental, even at minimal concentrations. Thus,
in summary, the optimal growth conditions for K562 cells
in air are guaranteed by a well-defined purine/pyrimidine
ratio; this equilibrium is altered by hypoxia, where the

oxygen-dependent purine synthesis is depressed, leaving
the pyrimidine pools unaltered.

Effects of purine or pyrimidine synthesis
inhibition in air in the absence or the
presence of antimycin A
The above data and inferences suggested to us to
compare the effects of specific inhibitors of purine or
pyrimidine synthesis, such as LY309887 or raltitrexed
(TDX), respectively, on the recruitment of K562 cells to
growth. Fig. 7A shows the concentration/response effects
of LY309887 or TDX on the total number of viable K562
cells in cultures incubated in air for 7 days. LY309887
started to inhibit cell growth at 10−9 M, reaching the
maximal effect around 5 × 10−8M; this indicates an
extreme sensitivity of purine pools to this inhibitor. On
the other hand, the inhibition brought about by TDX
started only at 5 × 10−8 M, to reach the maximum at almost
10−7M, indicating that K562 cells are at least ten times
more sensitive to the restriction of purines than to that
of pyrimidines. In other words, the endogenous purine
pool of these cells in air is insufficient to bring about cell
cycling upon exposure to even minimal concentrations
of LY309887. By contrast, the pyrimidine pool remains
sufficient for the maximal growth in the presence of
relatively high concentrations of TDX.
The crucial role played by the balance of DNA
base pools emerged from the experiments reported in
Fig. 7B–7D, where the concentration/response effects
of TDX on viable cell number in the absence or the
presence of antimycin A were compared. Fig. 7B, 7C
shows the effects of TDX on the time-course of K562

cell number in cultures incubated in air in the absence (B)
or the presence (C) of antimycin A. TDX concentrationdependently inhibited cell growth in air, whereas, in the
presence of antimycin A, TDX produced an unexpected
stimulation of cell growth in the range 10−8 to 5 × 10−8M.
This counterintuitive result indicates that a modest
inhibition of pyrimidine pool by low concentrations of
TDX stimulated cell growth by attenuating the marked
disequilibrium between the purine and pyrimidine pools.
This phenomenon is even more clearly shown in Fig. 7D,
where the data relative to the effects of TDX on viable cell
number at day 7 of incubation are reported as percentages
of the relative control (TDX-untreated, incubated in the
presence or the absence of antimycin A). Such a paradox
makes it predictable that TDX could have a detrimental
impact on therapy, promoting the growth resumption of
dormant cancer stem cells hidden in hypoxic niches [37]
(see Discussion).

The results of this study led us to conclude that K562
cells are a CML cell population endowed with an epigenetic
and metabolic trim that parallels the neoplastic progression
of a number of malignant tumors of different histogenesis.
This trim characterizes the tumor converging phenotype
[15], whose essential feature is an extreme morphological
and metabolic simplification centered on a high nucleus/
cytoplasma ratio and a poor, easily-saturated, mitochondrial
apparatus. This feature, which may well be responsible for
cancer radio- and chemio-resistance, resembles the one we
described for ESC expressing ETF [38, 39], whose energetic
metabolism, based on aerobic glycolysis, is vulnerable to
pyruvate, as outlined in the Introduction. We showed that
this metabolic configuration predisposes to unbalance the
purine/pyrimidine ratio, leading to cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis [36], a tendency that is realized in hypoxia.

Scheme 2 shows the biochemical pathways
implicated in DNA base synthesis [40], which share
CH2-FH4 as the initial metabolite and set in motion no less
than three syntheses, those of: (1) purines; (2) pyrimidines;
(3) methionine and acetylCoA derivatives of methyl-FH4
(CH3-FH4). Pathway (3) leads to the anaerobic synthesis of
CH3-FH4 through the reduction of CH2-FH4 by the NADPHdependent CH2-FH4-reductase, producing NADP. Pathway
(2) consists of the anaerobic conversion of dUMP to dTMP
catalysed by thymidylate-synthase (TS), in which CH2FH4
acts as a co-substrate, one-carbon unit donor. Pathway (1)
generates the purine pools through the RedOx pathway,
so-called to indicate its dependence on the NADP/NADPH
conversion [40]: this pathway, in fact, requires NADP at
two crucial steps: a) the oxidation of CH2-FH4 to CH-FH4
catalyzed by the CH2-FH4-dehydrogenase; b) the conversion
of CH-FH4 to formyl-FH4 (10-HCO-FH4) catalyzed by
the CH-FH4-cyclohydrolase. Both a) and b) reactions are
strictly NADP-dependent, requiring a high NADP/NADPH
ratio, so that they are inhibited when the respiratory chain
is blocked by antimycin A or saturated by pyruvate. This
inhibition can be removed by the addition of folate through

the reaction F  + NADPH → FH4 + NADP catalyzed
by the dihydrofolate-reductase (DHFR). Thus, it seems
straightforward to assume that hypoxia or antimycin A block
purine synthesis, while they favour pyrimidine synthesis
via the maintenance of CH2FH4 levels. On this assumption,
one would expect either treatment to generate an imbalance
between the two types of bases, altering the DNA synthesis
operated by DNA-polymerase, which requires a strict
equilibration of their ratio. More important still, we were
able to show that, in the absence of this equilibrium, a
high level of misincorporations occurs, likely to generate
mutation and hence apoptotic cell death [36, 41].
With regard to cancer chemotherapy, the biochemical
network summarized in Scheme 2 needs to be better
characterized. In this respect, the K562 cell line emerged
as a suitable model to study the response of blast-crisis
CML cells to “antifolate” drugs such as LY309887 or TDX.
This biochemical network, on the other hand, is of general
relevance to determine the role of cells expressing ETF in
the onset and development of cancer. In this respect, it is
worth pointing out that ESC are physiologically generated
in the gastrula, an early embryo stage characterized by

hypoxia. Indeed, the occurrence of ESC-like cells in the
tumor bulk is generally supposed to derive from their
capacity to home in hypoxic tissue niches, where they can
survive indefinitely in a dormant state [37]. These cells can
be generated in the bulk of tumors through the epigenetic
reprogramming of adult cells triggered and sustained in the
course of neoplastic progression [13], which indeed consists
of an uncontrolled drift to DNA mutations called chromatin
plasticity. Yamanaka and Hochedlinger demonstrated that
the absence of efficient p53 leads to chromatin instability,
that strongly facilitates epigenetic reprogramming down to
ESC [41–45]. Thus, the expression of ETF in the bulk of
tumors, whatever their origin, represents a powerful drive
to progression to an anaplastic phenotype. This evolution
is the main factor determining the risk of relapses, which
are impossible to prevent by the traditional antineoplastic
treatments. At the same time, however, the ESC-like cells
might consent a selective antitumor therapy based on their
specific vulnerability to pyruvate, FH4 and glutamine, for
which we here proposed the acronym of CCPF (CancerCytotoxic Physiological Factors). According to our
studies, via a strong reductive shift of NADP/NADPH
ratio, CCPF impair the aerobic purine synthesis through
the aerobic utilization of CH2-FH4 in the assembly of the
10-HCO-FH4 in the purine ring (pathway (1) of Scheme 2).
The extraordinary advantage of this approach lies in the fact
that CCPF, being physiological factors, are devoid of any
general toxicity for human beings.
In the light of all above, the results presented in this
paper are relevant to cancer therapy. Indeed, LY309887 or
TDX would be able to kill the bulk of the tumor but not to
interfere with the ETF-expressing stem cell compartment.
Furthermore, the use of inhibitors point of pyrimidine
synthesis, such as TDX, might generate the paradoxical
effect demonstrated in this paper, namely, the restoration
within the hypoxic stem cell niches of a more favourable
equilibrium between the two types of DNA bases, thereby
favouring the recruitment of dormant cells into the cycling
state. The low inhibitor concentrations driving this effect
correspond to the plasmatic levels which are usually
reached at the end of each treatment cycle and during
the necessary therapeutic intervals. This may represent a
serious limit to the use of TS inhibitors On the other hand,
it is also worth to be taken into consideration the possibility
that the paradoxical effect of TS inhibitors turn out useful
to rescue cell sensitivity to anti-proliferative agents if one
were to adopt a combination therapy protocol.

Experiments were established with cells rescued
from maintenance cultures, plated at 5 × 105/ml and
incubated for 24 hours ("intermediate" passage) at 37°C
in a water-saturated atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and
95% air, before the final replating into 24-well dishes.
Incubation in severe hypoxia was carried out in a watersaturated atmosphere containing 0.1% O2, 5% CO2,
95% N2, in a gas-tight incubator/manipulator (Ruskinn
Concept 400 or Don Whitley Scientific DG250 anaerobic
workstation) flushed with the above preformed gas
mixture. Such a workstation allows easy entry and exit of
materials and sample manipulation without compromising
the hypoxic environment. Controls of experiments in
hypoxia have been carried out incubating cells in air,
which is considered a standard condition for cell culture.
However, it is worth pointing out that incubation in air
generates an artificial hyperoxic condition which has
nothing to do with the real situation occurring in even the
best-oxygenated tissue environment [46].
Yoshida’s ascites hepatoma AH130 cells were
maintained and cultured as previously described [3].
Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion,
diluting cell suspension 1:1 with a 1% wt/vol trypan blue
solution (Sigma-Aldrich). The number of total and viable
cells was counted in a Bürker hemocytometer.

Immunofluorescence
Cell suspension was cytocentrifuged at 800 rpm
for 15 min and cells processed essentially as previously
described [3] and assayed with the following antibodies:
rabbit anti-Nanog, 1:800; mouse anti-Klf4, 1:800; rabbit
anti-Sox2, 1:800; rabbit anti-Oct3/4, 1:1000 (Stemgent).
Cells were then incubated with Cy3-conjugated antimouse, or fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (Chemicon) at 1:800 dilution. Cell nuclei were
stained with Hoechst 33258, 1:2000 (Sigma-Aldrich).

HPLC
Organic extracts were obtained from 107 cells with
75% ultrapure acetonitrile plus 25% 10 mM KH2PO4 at
pH 7.4. The extracts were completely dehydrated and
suspended in 20 μl of running buffer and analyzed in
a Perkin Helmer Series 200, UV/VIS Detector HPLC
apparatus, as previously described [4].

Flow cytometry

MATERIALS AND METHODS

To determine cell cycle distribution, 5 × 105 cells were
centrifuged for 6 min at 1,200 rpm, resuspended in 500 μl
of propidium iodide (PI) solution (trisodium citrate 0.1%
w/v, NP40 0.1% w/v, PI 50 μg/ml) (Merck, Biosciences,
Calbiochem respectively) and incubated for 30 min at 4°C in
darkness. Cells were then subjected to flow cytometry (BectonDickinson FACS-Canto) and data analyzed, to determine cell
cycle distribution, by the Mod fit LT software [3].

Cells and culture conditions
K562 cells were cultured in 24-well dishes
(EuroClone) at 3 × 104 /ml (2 ml/well) in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin,
50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (all from
EuroClone, Paignton, U.K., http://www.euroclone.net/).
