ABSTRACT
In addition to spliceosome gene mutations, oncogene expression and drug
resistance in AML might influence exon expression. We performed exon-array analysis
and exon-specific PCR (ESPCR) to identify specific landscapes of exon expression that
are associated with DEK and WT1 oncogene expression and the resistance of AML
cells to AraC, doxorubicin or azacitidine. Data were obtained for these five conditions
through exon-array analysis of 17 cell lines and 24 patient samples and were extended
through qESPCR of samples from 152 additional AML cases. More than 70% of AEUs
identified by exon-array were technically validated through ESPCR. In vitro, 1,130 to
5,868 exon events distinguished the 5 conditions from their respective controls while
in vivo 6,560 and 9,378 events distinguished chemosensitive and chemoresistant
AML, respectively, from normal bone marrow. Whatever the cause of this effect, 30 to
80% of mis-spliced mRNAs involved genes unmodified at the whole transcriptional
level. These AEUs unmasked new functional pathways that are distinct from those
generated by transcriptional deregulation. These results also identified new putative
pathways that could help increase the understanding of the effects mediated by DEK
or WT1, which may allow the targeting of these pathways to prevent resistance of
AML cells to chemotherapeutic agents.

INTRODUCTION

mutations such as refractory with ring sideroblasts and
thrombocytosis with SF3B1 mutation [19], as well as
AML with trisomy 13 and SRSF2 mutation [20]. Thus,
accounting for AS patterns in cancer is becoming an
important challenge because specific AS events may
represent useful biomarkers while the development of
spliceosome- [21] and AS-specific [22, 23] therapeutic
tools are in progress. Here we investigated whether the
expression of certain oncogenes and the resistance of AML
cells to anti-cancer drugs might be associated with specific
exon expression patterns. We used exon array analysis
confirmed by exon-specific PCR (ESPCR) to evaluate
AML cells expressing various amounts of either DEK or
WT1 and AML cells that show sensitivity or resistance
to AraC, doxorubicin (DXR) or azacitidine (AZA). Data
gathered from cell lines were confirmed in patient-derived
samples in which exon-arrays confirmed by exon-specific
RT-PCR permitted the identification of specific exon
expression patterns that are putatively involved in disease
phenotypes and responses to treatment.

Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) represents
a heterogeneous spectrum of myeloid malignancies that
harbor a constellation of chromosomal abnormalities
and gene mutations as well as transcriptional, proteomic,
metabolomic and epigenetic modifications. These
abnormalities have enabled better understanding of disease
mechanisms and generated diagnostic and prognostic tools
that rely on key therapeutic targets. Intensive anthracycline
and cytarabine (AraC)-based combination chemotherapy
has been the backbone of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
treatment for nearly forty years [1]. In patients for whom
such intensive treatment is unsuitable, hypomethylating
agents can prolong survival [2]. However, for both of these
therapeutic approaches resistance can be an issue. For
example, the expression and activity of the ATP Binding
Cassette B1 (ABC-B1; MDR1/Pgp) gene is significantly
correlated with the response to intensive chemotherapy
(IC) and disease outcome [3].
Beyond transcriptional modifications, recent
reports from exon-array analyses have shown a significant
deregulation of splicing in cancers, with approximately
one-third of expressed genes being abnormally spliced in
AML compared to normal CD34+ bone marrow cells [4].
These splicing events can be caused by numerous factors
such as spliceosome mutations [5], histone acetylation/
methylation, DNA CpG methylation and oncogene
expression [6]. WT1 and DEK are two oncogenes that
are regularly expressed in AML cells and both interact
with splicing machinery. WT1 physiologically influences
alternative splicing (AS) through interactions with
WTAP, RBM4 and the U2AF1/U2AF2 heterodimer,
which is involved in splice acceptor site recognition
by the splicing machinery [7–9]. In addition, WT1
mediates transcriptional repression of the splicing factor
kinase SRPK1 to alter mRNA splicing [10]. In line
with this evidence, Cunningham et al. recently showed
that WT1 regulates murine hematopoiesis via altered
VEGF splicing [11]. DEK was first discovered after the
identification of the translocation t(6;9) (p23;q34) in a
subset of AML patients [12], and further studies showed
a critical role for DEK in normal granulopoiesis and in
tumor development [13]. DEK is involved in chromatin
remodeling and may also influence mRNA splicing. In
fact, like WT1, DEK interacts with U2AF35/U2AF65 to
regulate splice acceptor site recognition by the splicing
machinery [14].
In AML, some spliceosome gene mutations are
associated with a specific pattern of AS [15], whereas
in solid tumors certain isoform switches associated
with tumor development are independent of somatic
mutations  [16]. Specific patterns of AEUs have been
associated with tumor aggressiveness and response
to treatment [17, 18], while certain hematological
malignancies harbor a specific pattern of spliceosome

RESULTS
Oncogene-associated exon expression profile in
AML cells
WT1 and DEK are frequently overexpressed
in AML and can interfere with spliceosome activity
[7–11, 14]. We hypothesized that the expression of these
two oncogenes might influence exon expression patterns
in AML cells. We thus used Affymetrix HTA2 exon
arrays to examine the exon expression profiles of three
AML cell lines (MOLM13, Kasumi-1 and KG1) that had
normal or knocked-down levels of WT1 or DEK gene
expression. shRNA-WT1 significantly reduced the level
of WT1 mRNA and protein expression in the three cell
lines (Figure S1A) and similar results were obtained
with DEK (data not shown). Microarray data were crosscompared between the cell lines and only statistically
significant modifications (p < 0.05) were selected.
Computational analyses of exon arrays and annotation
of exon events were carried out as previously described
[24] and as detailed in the Methods section. Figure 1A
shows the distribution of quantitative and qualitative gene
modifications in cells stably knocked down for either
WT1 or DEK expression as compared to cells treated with
control PLKO vector. For WT1, 1, 573 AEU events were
identified across 1, 200 genes, of which 495 (41%) were
altered at the whole gene expression level (Figure 1A).
For DEK, 1, 130 AEU events were identified among 934
genes, with 188 (20%) altered at the level of whole gene
expression (Figure  1A). The distribution of alternative
splicing events was significantly different between DEK
and WT1 expression ( p = 0.008, Pearson’s Chi-squared
test, Figure 1B). Notably, the proportions of alternative
last exon (p = 0.009), acceptor (p < 10−4), intron-retention

by both oncogenes. These 20 genes displayed the same
deregulation with either WT1 or DEK expression.
Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed to
gain insight into the functional significance of either
full gene or exon expression profiles that distinguish
PLKO- from shRNA-infected cells. As shown in
Figure 1C, D, large subsets of enriched genes were
related to pathways that are known to be affected in

(p = 0.004) and promoter (p = 0.021) were significantly
different between the two cell categories. Cells knocked
down for either DEK or WT1 were found to share 99 exon
events with the same regulation that were harbored by
83 genes (Supplementary Table 1). Among these genes,
24 and 36 were found to be transcriptionally deregulated
by DEK and WT1, respectively (Supplementary Figure 2),
including 20 genes that were transcriptionally modified

AML cells. DEK and WT1 displayed common and
specific functional pathways with respect to both AS
and whole gene expression. Six functional pathways,
which represented 37.5% and 43% of DEK- and WT1associated exon pathways, respectively, were found to
be shared by the two cell categories (Figure 1C, 1D).
Fourteen of the 16 pathways (87.5%) generated by
AS in cells knocked down for DEK were distinct
from those induced by whole transcriptional changes
(Figure 1B). The proportion was 13/14 (93%) in cells
knocked down for WT1 (Figure 1C). Thus, AS analysis
unmasked numerous functional pathways that were
undetectable through whole gene expression analysis.
To validate exon array-predicted exon usage at the
technical level, ESPCR was carried out for 65 mRNAs.
Of these 65 array-predicted exon usages, 46 (71%) were
validated by ESPCR (Figure 1D, Table 1; Supplementary

Figure 3). Together these results suggest that in AML
DEK and WT1 oncogenes trigger distinct landscapes of
AEU events that have putative implications for disease
development and response to chemotherapy.

Exon expression profiles in chemoresistant
AML cells
The combination of AraC and doxorubicin
represents the backbone of AML induction chemotherapy
(IC), while AZA is an effective alternative for treating
AML in elderly patients. Thus, the sensitivity of K562,
K562/AraC and K562-R7 cells to AraC and doxorubicin
was assessed with a trypan blue dye exclusion assay
(Supplementary Figure 4). Azacitidine sensitivity of
the SKM1 cell preparations used here was previously
verified with an MTT assay [25]. In AraC-resistant

and hsa04512:ECM-receptor interaction) that represented
25%, 31% and 14% of AraC-, DXR- and AZA-associated
pathways, respectively.

between shDEK cells, shWT1 cells, AraC-, DXR- and
AZA-resistant cells and fresh AML samples from SG1,
respectively (Supplementary Tables 5–9). The values were
55 (0.6%), 39 (0.4%), 153 (1.6%), 120 (1.3%), and 323
(3.4%) for SG3 and these differences were not statistically
significant. Despite the absence of quantitative differences
in the frequency of drug-associated exon events between
SG1 and SG3, there was a distinct qualitative event
distribution between the two groups (Supplementary
Tables 7–9). Hence, none of the AraC- or DXR-associated
events identified in the diagnosis samples were shared by
SG1 and SG3 (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). In contrast,
88 AZA-resistance-specific exon events were shared
between the SG1 and SG3 samples. For AraC-associated
exon events, GO analysis identified no functional pathway
in samples from the SG1 group, while several functional
pathways involved in cancer, leukemia and drug resistance
were identified in SG3 samples (Figure 3E). For DXRassociated exon events, GO analysis identified three
pathways in SG1 samples (hsa04110: Cell cycle, hsa00052:
Galactose metabolism, and hsa04144: Endocytosis) and
two pathways in SG3 samples (hsa04810: Regulation of
actin cytoskeleton and hsa05200: Pathways in cancer).
For AZA-associated exon-events GO identified 7 and
19 pathways in SG1 and SG3 samples, respectively
(Figure  3E). We next investigated whether the mRNA
of genes that are frequently mutated in AML are misspliced in these cell lines and patient-derived samples. We
randomly selected 40 genes that are frequently mutated in
AML (Supplementary Table 10) [27, 28] and found that
13 of these genes (32.5%) were mis-spliced in at least one
leukemic condition. As a control, we randomly selected
from the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ge
ne/?term=acute+myeloid+leukemia) 40 mRNAs that are
expressed in AML cells. Five of these genes (12.5%) were
mis-spliced in at least one leukemic condition (p = 0.03,
Pearson’s Chi-squared test).

Exon-array analysis of fresh bone marrow
samples derived from patients with
chemo-sensitive versus -resistant AML
Exon array analysis was performed with 24 samples
derived from 17 patients treated with AraC-anthracyclinebased IC (protocol ALFA 07–01 [26]). Patients were
distributed in two groups (PG1 and 2) and samples
were divided into three groups (SG1–3) (Table 2). PG1
corresponded to patients who achieved a prolonged
complete remission (CR) (> 4 years) and who were in
persistent CR at the time of their last follow-up. PG2
corresponded to patients with primary resistant disease.
SG1 and SG2 corresponded to samples harvested from
patients in the PG1 group at the time of diagnosis and CR,
respectively. SG3 corresponded to the diagnosis samples
from PG2 cases. SG2 samples served as negative controls
and their exon expression was compared with the SG1 and
SG3 samples. For SG1 samples, 6, 560 AEU events were
identified across 2, 911 genes, of which 2, 233 (77%) were
altered at the level of whole gene expression (Figure 3A).
The values were 9, 378, 3, 738 and 2, 973 (79%) for SG3
samples, which corresponded to AML with induction
failure (Figure 3A). With the exception of exon/ALE events
that were significantly more frequent in SG3 samples
(267/6, 560 versus 451/9, 378, p =  0.027, Fisher exact
test), the distribution of AEU types did not significantly
differ between the two AML types (Figure 3B). Figure 3
(3C-3E) represents the distribution of the functional
pathways generated by AEU and transcriptional events
in samples derived from the SG1 and SG3 groups. For
SG1, 15 of the 19 pathways (79%) generated by AS were
distinct from those generated by whole transcriptional
changes (Supplementary Figure 5A). For SG3 the values
were 13 and 16 (81%) (Supplementary Figure 5B). SG1
and SG3 shared nine exon pathways, or 47% and 56% of
the SG1 and SG3-associated pathways (Figure 3C-D). We
next evaluated the distribution of oncogene- and drugassociated AEUs and pathways between samples from
the SG1 and SG3 groups. Thirty-three (0.5%), 38 (0.6%),
77 (1.2%), 77 (1, 2%) and 216 (3.3%) exon events were
shared at the gene, exon position, and regulation levels

Quantitative exon-specific PCR analysis of
ex-vivo identified AEUs in cells derived from
AML patients
The above results identified either common or
specific AEUs in AML cells displaying specific biological
or clinical leukemic features. Of note, numerous AEUs
corresponding to previously unknown putative disease
markers and therapeutic targets were identified in the
absence of whole gene transcriptional changes. Moreover,

were identified through exon-microarrays, including

Figure 3: (Continued ) E. Pathway analysis for genes that were qualitatively modified in both AZA-resistant cells and SG1- (top) or
SG3- (bottom) derived samples.
mRNA from the TET2 gene and four ATP transporters,
were analyzed in detail in AML cell lines as well as in
bone marrow samples derived from 152 AML and 37
normal bone marrow samples. TET2 is a dioxygenase
that catalyzes the conversion of 5-methylcytosine
to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and promotes DNA
demethylation [29]. TET2 somatic mutations occur in
7–23% of AMLs and 25% of myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS), and are distributed across the entire coding
sequence without clustering into obvious hot spots [30].
These mutations decrease TET2 enzymatic activity by
producing truncations or affecting its catalytic activity
[29]. Little is known about TET2 exon expression
patterns in AML, although exon-array analyses performed
here and confirmed by ESPCR and qESPCR identified
an AEU event involving TET2 exon 2 in AraC-resistant
K562/AraC cells and in SG1 samples that were derived
from patients who achieved a prolonged CR with IC. Two
sets of qESPCR primers were designed to amplify the two
alternative splicing events identified in TET2 mRNA by
FASTERDB (Figure 4A). In addition, whole TET2 gene
expression was quantified through RT-PCR amplification
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of TET2 exon 10 sequences. K562/AraC cells carried
no significant change at the whole TET2 transcription
level while exon-array analysis showed no significant
changes in mRNA splicing for the remaining TET2 gene
exons in AraC-resistant versus -sensitive cells (Figure 4
and not  shown). In vivo, the level of TET2 exon 2
expression was significantly lower in the 152 AML cases
tested compared to the 37 control bone marrow samples
derived from healthy donors (Figure 4B, p < 10−4, MannWhitney test) and this change occurred in the absence
of significant alterations in TET2 exon 10 expression
(Figure 4B). These results confirm that the skipping of
TET2 exon 2 identified through exon-arrays is a bona fide
AEU event in patient-derived samples. Meanwhile, exonarray experiments confirmed by ESPCR identified AEU
events in 13 ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
gene mRNAs in DEK- and WT1-expressing cells, as well
as in AraC-, DXR-, AZA-resistant cells and SG1 and SG3
patient samples. We designed specific PCR primer pairs
in order to amplify 4 AEUs that exon microarrays and
ESPCR identified in the mRNA of four ABC transporter
genes, namely ABC-A2, -A3, -A5 and -C3 upon WT1

expression in cell lines (Supplementary Figure 1). WT1
expression was quantified in the six cell lines and also in
152 AML bone marrow samples and 37 marrow samples
from healthy donors (Supplementary Figure 7). As with
TET2 AS analysis, for each ABC transporter mRNA two
sets of qESPCR primers were designed to amplify the
two alternative splicing events identified by FASTERDB
(Figure 5). This assay provided an estimated relative
expression level for two isoforms for each of the four
ABC transporters. Microarray and qESPCR analyses

cells (Supplementary Figure 8). qESPCR was carried
out with bone marrow samples derived from 152 AML
patients and 37 healthy bone marrow donors. For each
exon event, non-parametric bivariate correlation analyses
determined that there was a statistically significant
correlation between WT1 expression and the distribution
of the four ABC transporter isoforms in AML but not in
the control samples (Figure 5). The correlation between
WT1 and ABC-A3 and -A5 isoform expression was
in parallel with that from fresh AML samples and the
three cell lines (Figure 5A). For ABC-A2 isoforms
(Figure 5B), a correlation was present between AML
and Kasumi-1 cells that was opposite that for AML
and MOLM13 or KG1 cells. For ABC-C3 (not shown),
expression levels in AML and MOLM13 or KG1 were
similar but the opposite was true for AML and Kasumi-1
cells. The two TET2 isoforms identified in SG1 samples

and AraC-resistant cells were not associated with WT1
expression in each of the three cell lines as shown by
microarray and qESPCR (Figure 5C). In contrast to ABC
transporter AEUs, no correlation was found between
WT1 expression and the distribution of the two TET2
isoforms in fresh AML samples (Figure 5C). Thus, these
results identify a specific and significant correlation
between WT1 expression and alternative splicing of the
ABC transporters ABC-A2, -A3, -A5 and -C3 in AML
samples.

patterns of exon-array-evidenced AEU, which were
validated by ESPCR analysis of more than 60 AEUs.
Regardless of the conditions, our results identified several
mis-spliced mRNAs that are related to oncogenes or
tumor suppressors as illustrated by GO analysis, which
implicated several AEU-associated pathways consistent
with AML development, persistence and resistance to
treatment.
Analyzing oncogene-associated AEUs revealed
that DEK and WT1 triggered specific and common
AEU events. Regarding the event type, the proportion
of alternative last exon, acceptor, intron-retention and
promoter was significantly different between cells
expressing DEK or WT1. However, whether these
differences arise from different kinds of molecular
interplay between the two factors and the splicing
machinery remains to be investigated. In addition, 99 exon
events were found to be shared between the two cell types.
Interestingly, for both DEK (80%) and WT1 (59%), the
majority of identified AEU events involved genes that
were unmodified at the whole gene transcription level.
Accordingly, exon expression analysis unmasked several
important pathways, including those involved in ABC
transporters, tight junctions, actin cytoskeleton regulation
and the MAPK signaling pathway.
Drug resistance is a major concern in AML
management. In vitro drug resistance appeared to
generate a significantly higher number of exon events
than oncogene expression. Exon array-based analysis of
drug-resistant cells showed that AraC-, DXR- and AZAresistant cells show significantly distinct patterns of
exon expression. Both AEU types and the targeted genes
differed markedly between cells that were resistant to
AraC, DXR and AZA. The proportion of mRNAs carrying
AEUs in the absence of whole gene transcriptional
changes was significantly lower with drug resistance than
either DEK or WT1 expression with 32%, 37% and 49%
for AraC, DXR and AZA, respectively. However GO
analysis showed that these latter exon events unmasked
new important functional pathways (Figure 2), with
more than 80% being distinct from those generated by
whole gene transcription changes. Cells resistant to
the pyrimidine analogs AraC and AZA shared 13 exonassociated functional pathways whereas cells that are
resistant to the intercalating agent DXR and either AraC or
AZA shared only six exon-associated functional pathways.
Numerous AEUs distinguished AML samples from
control bone marrow samples. These AEUs involved
about 3,000 genes, with 20% unmodified at the whole
gene transcription level. In contrast to the different kinds
of analyzed cell lines, no important fluctuations in the
distribution of AEU types appeared between samples
derived from the SG1 and SG3 groups, with the only
significant difference being the distribution of exon/ALE
events between the two sample groups. About 80% of
AML-associated functional pathways were distinct from

DISCUSSION
AS occurs in 95% of all multi-exonic genes and
can promote cell growth and survival in cancer [17, 31].
Accordingly, AS can lead to loss-of-function of tumor
suppressors, activation of oncogene pathways, immune
escape and resistance to treatment [32]. These events all
occur in AML [4]. Several reports have found somatic
mutations that occurred in splicing factors in AML, yet
their frequency is significantly lower than that observed
in other myeloid malignancies such as myelodysplastic
syndromes [6]. In addition to spliceosome gene mutations,
numerous abnormalities acquired by AML cells might
disturb AS. They include epigenetic changes such as CpG
methylation and histone modifications, which can interfere
with RNA polymerization and AS as well as DEK and
WT1 gene expression. Given this context, we wanted to
assess the effect of DEK, WT1 and chemoresistance on
the pattern of exon expression in AML. To this end we
designed AML cell lines expressing low versus high levels
of DEK and WT1 and used K562 and SKM1 cells that are
resistant or sensitive to AraC, DXR or AZA. Twenty-four
clinical samples derived from two groups of patients having
distinct outcomes following IC were also analyzed with
exon-arrays. The exon-array analysis of these 41 samples
could be validated by ESPCR in 45/65 tested AEU events
while 152 AML diagnosis samples and 37 control bone
marrow samples were analyzed by qESPCR for TET2,
ABC-A2, -A3, -A5 and -C3 isoform expression. This
study identified both in vitro and in vivo-specific patterns
of exon expression as they relate to oncogene expression
and resistance to the main agents used to treat AML.
A recent study investigated exon expression in
samples from newly-diagnosed AML patients using
exon-array analysis [4]. This work gave consistent
results with two cohorts of 31 and 36 patients analyzed
by exon-array, and showed that about 30% of expressed
genes are abnormally spliced in AML. Although not
confirmed through ESPCR, the results suggested that
certain AEUs involved mRNAs that were related to
several oncogenes, tumor suppressor proteins, splicing
factors and heterogeneous-nuclear-ribonucleoproteins, as
well as proteins involved in apoptosis, cell proliferation
and spliceosome assembly. Here we assessed the exon
expression in several situations that provided distinct

those associated with whole gene transcription changes,
yet six and five pathways were specific to cells derived
from patients with chemosensitive and chemoresistant
AML, respectively. However, the proportion of oncogenes
and drug resistance-associated-AEUs was not significantly
different between cells derived from resistant and
chemosensitive AML, although the qualitative distribution
of drug-associated AEUs was clearly distinct between the
two cell categories. Assuming that AEU plays a role in the
resistance of AML to IC, these results suggest that such
effects would depend more on a propitious combination
of AEU than quantitative fluctuations of individual exon
events. Consistent with this line of thinking, AML cells
derived from newly diagnosed patients who subsequently
showed drug resistance and treatment failure were found to
be significantly enriched in AEUs involving prognostically
relevant genes [27, 28].
ESPCR and qESPCR are useful tools for validating
exon-array data at a technical level and for analyzing exon
events on a large scale. Having observed the skipping
of TET2 exon 2 in AraC-resistant AML cells and in
diagnosis samples from patients with chemosensitive
disease, we were interested to check the status of
the TET2 exon 2 in our series of 152 AML samples.
qESPCR demonstrated that TET2 exon 2 is expressed at
significantly lower levels in AML samples compared to
normal bone marrow cells, which occurred in the absence
of notable changes in the expression of the full TET2
gene. Moreover, there are approximately 50 known human
ABC transporter genes encoding proteins that translocate
solutes and drugs across cellular membranes. In addition
to ABC-B1 (MDR1/Pgp)-mediated chemoresistance [33,
34], genetic polymorphisms [35] as well as functional
[36] and transcriptional [37] analyses have shown that
an increasing number of ABC transporters, including
ABC-A3, ABC-C1, ABC-C3 and ABC-G2, can cause
resistance to cancer chemotherapeutic agents [3, 38–40].
For the four ABC transporters examined here (ABC-A2,
-A3, -A5 and -C3), we found altered splicing concurrent
with WT1 expression in vitro. qESPCR quantification
validated this correlation between WT1 expression and
exon events in vivo for these four AEUs. As with TET2,
these differences occurred in the absence of significant
correlations between the expression of the full ABC-A2,
-A3, -A5 and -C3 genes and WT1.
In conclusion, the present study showed for the
first time that in addition to splicing factor mutations,
additional AML features such as oncogene expression
and drug exposure can modify the landscape of exon
expression. These changes involve numerous genes that
are unmodified at the whole gene transcription level, and
unmasked exon-specific functional pathways. Future
studies are needed to determine how oncogene expression
and drug resistance can trigger these specific patterns and
to validate how exon expression patterns affect protein
function, as would be the case for ABC transporter drug

efflux activity. Such validation will prompt exploration
of the specific triggers of certain AS events with spliceswitching oligonucleotides that can inhibit AS and may
represent a promising tool for treating disease-associated
exon skipping [22, 23]. Previous reports have suggested
that certain splicing events, such those involving WT1
[41], TP53 [42], HOXA9 [43], BAALC [44], VEGF
[45] or BCL-X [46], might influence disease outcome
in intensively treated AML. The present identification of
numerous AEUs that are specifically associated with drug
resistance in vitro and treatment failure in vivo prompts
further evaluation of their prognostic implications and
potential use as biomarkers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient population and samples
The medical ethics committee of the Hospices
Civils de Lyon approved this study. Informed consent was
obtained from patients and healthy volunteers in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki and institutional guidelines.
The experimental cohort consisted of 17 patients treated
with French acute leukemia group (ALFA) protocol ALFA0701 [26] who were selected based on treatment response
and outcome. As summarized in Table x, these patients were
distributed into two groups with respect to IC response
and outcome. The first group included seven patients who
achieved prolonged relapse-free complete remission (CR, >
4 years) without known relapse at the time of last followup. The second group included 10 patients with primary
resistance to IC. Bone marrow cells were collected at the
time of diagnosis and, in patients from the first group, at the
time of complete remission. The validation cohort consisted
of 226 AML patients diagnosed at Lyon’s or Saint Etienne
university hospital. Control cells corresponded to bone
marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs, 37 samples) derived
from bone marrow donors.

Cell lines
The human AML cell lines Kasumi-1, MOLM13
and KG1 were purchased from ATCC (American Type
Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured
in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA)
containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (PAA
Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria), 1% L-glutamine
and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St.
Louis, MO, USA). The cell lines have been authenticated
by ATCC. These three cell lines are representative of
the main AML subtypes: Kasumi-1 harbors a t(8;21)
translocation, MOLM13 was derived from an AMLM5a patient and KG1 cells originated from the bone
marrow of a 59-year-old male AML patient. The SKM1
cell line was established from the peripheral blood of
a 76-year-old Japanese man with acute monoblastic

normalized using quintile normalization. The background
correction and probe selection were performed as previously
described [49].

Exon-specific polymerase chain
reaction (ESPCR)
Splicing events were annotated on the FASTERDB
database and primers were designed to encompass
alternative splicing events using Primer 3. PCR reactions
were performed using the Herculase II Fusion DNA
Polymerase (Agilent Technologies) in 30–35 cycles and
the resulting products were analyzed by agarose gel
electrophoresis. Primer sequences are available on request.
Samples were analyzed in duplicate.

RNA interference and lentivirus
For WT1 RNA interference, a pool of 4
validated shRNA sequences purchased from Sigma
(5′-CCGGGCAGCTAACAATGTCTGGTTACTCGAG
TAACCAGACATTGTTAGCTGCTTTTTG-3′,
5′-CCGGGCATCTGAGACCAGTGAGAAACTCGAG

AGGTGGCTCCTAAGTTCATCTTTTTG-3′,
5′-CCGGTATAAGTACTAGATGCATCACCTCGAG
GTGATGCATCTAGTACTTATATTTTTG-3′) were used.
Lentiviral particles were generated by transfection of
lentiviral plasmids and packaging mix (purchased from
Sigma) into HEK-293-T cells using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). Supernatants containing viral particles
were harvested between 36–72 h after transfection and
purified for use in WT1 knock-down experiments. The
empty PLKO.1 vector was used as a negative control.
For lentiviral infection, 1.5 × 106/mL MOLM13, KG1
or Kasumi-1 cells were incubated with recombinant
lentiviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 1:5 for 72 h.
The same procedure was used for DEK RNA interference
with the four validated shRNA sequences. Sequences are
available on request.

Quantitative exon-specific polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR)
cDNA was amplified by qPCR using a Bio-Rad
Chromo4: CD002161 device and 20 μl reactions with iQ
SYBR Green PCR Supermix (BioRad) and 10 μM of each
appropriate primer. The expression of the housekeeping
gene Gus (NM_000181) was used as an internal control.
A melting curve (65–92°C) was generated at the end of
each run to verify primer specificity. The Pfaffl method
was used for relative quantification [50]. Primer sequences
are available on request.
