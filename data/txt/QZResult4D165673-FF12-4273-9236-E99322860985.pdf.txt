BACKGROUND: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is up-regulated in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
Nevertheless, inhibition of mTOR is ineffective in inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, likely because of the compensatory upregulation of the androgen receptor (AR) pathway. METHODS: Patients who were eligible for this study had to have progressive
CRPC with serum testosterone levels <50 ng/dL. No prior bicalutamide (except to prevent flare) or everolimus was allowed. Treatment included oral bicalutamide 50 mg and oral everolimus 10 mg, both once daily, with a cycle defined as 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (30% reduction) from baseline. A sample size of 23 patients would have
power of 0.8 and an a error of .05 (1-sided) if the combination had a PSA response rate of 50% versus a historic rate of 25% with
bicalutamide alone. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled. The mean age was 71.1 years (range, 53.0-87.0 years), the mean
PSA level at study entry was 43.4 ng/dL (range, 2.5-556.9 ng/dL), and the mean length of treatment was 8 cycles (range, 1.0-23.0
cycles). Of 24 patients, 18 had a PSA response (75%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-0.90), whereas 15 (62.5%; 95% CI, 0.41-0.81)
had a PSA decrease 50%. The median overall survival was 28 months (95% CI, 14.1-42.7 months). Fourteen patients (54%; 95% CI,
0.37-0.78) developed grade 3 (13 patients) or grade 4 (1 patient with sepsis) adverse events that were attributable to treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of bicalutamide and everolimus has encouraging efficacy in men with bicalutamide-naive CRPC, thus
warranting further investigation. A substantial number of patients experienced everolimus-related toxicity. Cancer 2016;122:1897-904.

INTRODUCTION
Over 80% of patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer (CaP) have localized disease, with treatment options between the
2 standard forms of curative therapy: radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. Approximately 1=3 of patients who receive
local therapies will have a biochemical recurrence.1,2 Some of these patients can be salvaged with either radiotherapy or
(rarely) surgery, depending on previous therapy received. The remaining patients with recurrent CaP and those who present
with metastatic CaP are usually treated with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), which initially is highly effective.3 However, most patients will develop castration-resistant CaP (CRPC) within 18 to 24 months.4 Second-line therapy with an
androgen receptor (AR) modulator, such as bicalutamide, is associated with a response rate around 25% and a duration of
response of a few months.3,5 Although new medications, such as enzalutamide and abiraterone, have been approved after
bicalutamide, long-term survival is extremely rare. Most patients will become resistant to the treatment, and at least 27,000
patients die each year from this disease.6 Therefore, there is a substantial need to improve upon new treatment options.
Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain castration-resistance, such as overexpression of AR, AR mutation,
autocrine or paracrine production of androgen, and alternative signaling pathways, among others. We previously reported
up-regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in CRPC cell lines and in CaP cells treated with
ADT.7 mTOR is a key serine-threonine kinase that regulates protein synthesis, cell growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, and
survival. However, a previous study demonstrated that inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway also up-regulated the AR

signaling pathway.7 This compensatory mechanism
explained why an mTOR inhibitor alone has little therapeutic effect in CRPC.8 We observed that inhibition of the
mTOR signaling pathway up-regulated the AR signaling
pathway, which compensated for the therapeutic effect of
an mTOR inhibitor.7 In addition, bicalutamide inhibited
AR transcriptional activity stimulated by rapamycin without affecting inhibition of the mTOR pathway.
Simultaneous treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and the AR inhibitor bicalutamide apparently enhanced
growth inhibition by rapamycin in both androgendependent and independent sublines of LNCaP cells,
although bicalutamide had no effect on the growth of
CRPC cells as a single agent. Similar synergistic effects of the
combination of an AR antagonist and an mTOR antagonist
also were observed with in vivo xenograft models.9-11
A similar concept of targeting the estrogen receptor
(ER) and mTOR pathways was used in the treatment of
breast cancer with everolimus, in which sensitivity to hormone therapy was restored by reestablishing levels of ER
and ER-inducible target genes. This resulted in the
enhancement of sensitivity to tamoxifen and prevention
of the development of resistance to hormone therapy by
inducing apoptosis in long-term hormone-deprived
cells.12 Efficacy had been established from the Initial
Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus-2 (BOLERO-2)
study, which evaluated the addition of everolimus to an
aromatase inhibitor, exemestane, in postmenopausal
women with ER-positive/human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who were refractory to nonsteroidal
aromatase inhibitors.13
On the basis of these preclinical studies and a similar
concept from the BOLERO-2 study, we evaluated the
combination of bicalutamide and everolimus (RAD001;
an mTOR inhibitor) in treating CRPC. We hypothesized
that simultaneous blockade of the mTOR and AR pathways would be synergistic against CRPC cells and that
this could be demonstrated in a clinical trial. The primary
objective of this trial was to determine the prostatespecific antigen (PSA) response rate of bicalutamide plus
everolimus in the treatment of CRPC after the first-line
ADT. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
National Clinical Trial NCT00814788.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility

Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were aged
>18 years, had a histologically or cytological confirmed
1898

diagnosis of CaP, and had castration levels of testosterone
(<50 ng per deciliter or 1.7 nmol/L) within 3 months
before registration. Patients were required to have CaP
that was deemed castration-resistant by: 1) progression of
unidimensionally measurable disease assessed within 42
days before initial administration of drug, 2) progression
of evaluable but not measurable disease assessed within 42
days before the initial administration of drug for PSA
evaluation and for imaging studies, or 3) at least 2 consecutive rises in PSA measured at least 1 week apart. Patients
who had biochemically recurrent or metastatic prostate
cancer (M0 and M1) were eligible. Patients must have
remained on ADT; and they were required to have an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
of 0 to 2, adequate vital organ function, and adequate
bone marrow function.
Exclusion criteria for the study included: any hormone therapy other than ADT (except to prevent flare) or
mTOR inhibitors. Patients with the following conditions
also were excluded from this study: uncontrolled, serious,
concurrent illness; receiving antiretroviral therapy for
human immunodeficiency virus infection; and any major
surgery or significant traumatic injury within the previous
4 weeks of the start of study drug. Patients who were
receiving chronic, systemic treatment with corticosteroids
or another immunosuppressive agent also were excluded.
A complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the protocol (see online supporting information).
Study Design and Treatment

This clinical trial was originally designed as a phase 1b,
lead-in safety trial followed by a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial in patients with
CRPC. Because there was an administrative delay in
obtaining matched placebo tablets, this trial was converted to a single-arm phase 2 trial comparing results with
a historic control of bicalutamide as second-line hormone
therapy. During the lead-in safety trial, 8 patients were
recruited at oral bicalutamide 50 mg daily plus oral everolimus 10 mg once daily. Each cycle was defined as 4
weeks. At each cycle, patients were evaluated clinically for
side effects and response, and they underwent laboratory
testing (PSA, complete blood count, and comprehensive
metabolic panel). Lactate dehydrogenase measurement
was not part of the trial. If patients had measurable
lesions, then imaging studies were performed every 2
cycles. If patients did not have any measurable lesions,
then imaging studies were not required unless clinically
indicated. After 4 cycles, patients were followed every
2 cycles (8 weeks). After no grade 3 toxicities were

included for the final analysis. Secondary objectives were
to evaluate the time to treatment failure and overall survival of patients with CRPC who received treatment with
bicalutamide plus everolimus and to assess the toxicity of
bicalutamide and everolimus.

observed during the first 4 weeks, the trial entered phase
2; 8 patients who were recruited in the lead-in safety phase
were included in the final efficacy analysis (Fig. 1).
Study Endpoints

The primary objective of the trial was to determine the
PSA response rate of bicalutamide plus everolimus in
the treatment of CRPC after first-line ADT. The PSA
response rate was defined as a 30% reduction in the PSA
level from baseline. A 30% reduction was selected as the
principal response discriminant (instead of 50% according to the criteria of Bubley et al) because of data from the
Southwest Oncology Group 9916 trial of docetaxel/estramustine versus mitoxantrone/prednisone, which demonstrated that the 30% level met the Prentice criteria for
survival surrogacy.14 However, patients who experienced
a reduction 50% in PSA level, according to the Bubley
et al criteria,15,16 also were recorded in the database and
Cancer

June 15, 2016

We used the PSA Working Group consensus criteria16
combined with radiographic studies to determine the proportion of patients with a PSA decline and the time to
progression. Response and progression were evaluated in
this study using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) criteria.17 PSA criteria for response
and progression were based on the PSA Working Group
consensus criteria.16 PSA declines of at least 30% with no
other evidence of disease progression were recorded for
each cohort. We also recorded PSA responses that were at
least a 50% decline. Progressive disease was defined by
any of the following criteria: 1) a 25% increase in the size
of all soft tissue masses and/or the appearance of new
lesions, 2) the need for radiation therapy, and 3) 2 consecutively increasing PSA measurements by >50% of the nadir PSA for patients with a PSA response or by >25% of
the nadir or baseline (whichever is lower) PSA for patients
without a PSA response. At baseline, PSA tests; computed
tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; bone
scans; and a clinical disease assessment for palpable lesions
were performed. Postbaseline imaging studies and PSA
tests were performed every 8 weeks. The study used version 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events for toxicity and
adverse event reporting.
Statistical Analysis

All patients who received any study drugs were assessable
for toxicity and disease response. In total, 24 patients were
included in the analyses. The objective of the primary
analysis was to calculate the PSA decrease from baseline
and to determine PSA responses 30%. Sample size was
determined with the hypothesis that the addition of everolimus would increase the PSA response rate from 25%
with bicalutamide alone (historic control) to 50% with
the bicalutamide and everolimus combination.18 In total,
24 patients were needed with a power of 0.8 and a Type I
error a of .05 (1-sided) to detect this difference. Descriptive summary values (mean, standard deviation,
minimum, maximum) were completed for quantitative
variables (age, PSA at baseline and follow-up, and treatments completed) along with frequency percentages for
categorical variables (treatment, treatment frequency, best

response, survival status, ethnicity, race). The observed
proportion, with exact 95% confidence interval (CI), was
calculated for each response level: complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Overall survival and progression-free survival were estimated
using the Kaplan-Meier method. The percentage PSA
decrease from baseline was defined at each follow-up as
100% 3 (baseline PSA 2 PSA at nadir)/baseline PSA.
The number and proportion of patients whose PSA
decrease was 30% for at least 1 follow-up were calculated as the primary response, and the number of those
who had a PSA decrease >50% was calculated as a secondary response. The number of adverse responses was
summarized by type and severity.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

In total, 24 patients were recruited from February 20,
2009 to January 4, 2013 and received treatment with
the bicalutamide and everolimus combination. Patientsâ€™
baseline demographic data are summarized in Table 1. All
treated patients were included in the assessment of efficacy
and toxicity and in the survival analyses. The mean patient
age was 71.1 years (range, 53.0-87.0 years), and the mean
number of treatments completed was 8 cycles (range, 123 cycles). The mean PSA level at study entry was 43.4
ng/dL (range, 2.5-556.9 ng/dL). The maximum percentage PSA decrease was calculated as the baseline PSA value
minus the nadir PSA value divided by the baseline PSA
value. On average, the patients had received 2.7 years
(range, 1-6 years) of ADT before entering the clinical trial.
Bone and lymph nodes were the most frequent sites of
metastasis. Fourteen patients had bone metastases,
and 3 had lymph node involvement only (58% and
13%, respectively). Three patients had both bone and
lymph node metastases (13%). Two patients (8%) had
nonmetastatic CRPC with biochemically recurrence only.
Furthermore, only 1 patient (4%) had received 1 previous
chemotherapeutic regimen with docetaxel-based chemotherapy. It should be noted that 20 of 24 patients (83%)
received further treatments (hormone and/or chemotherapy) after disease progression; 5 patients (21%) received
2 lines of a chemotherapy regimen, and 16 (67%)
received further hormone manipulation. At the time of
data collection cutoff on July 31, 2013, 4 patients (17%)
ultimately had progressive disease, 2 (8%) were removed
from the trial because of excessive toxicities, 1 (4%) was
removed because of unrelated renal artery stenosis, 5
(21%) decided to withdraw from the study, 2 (8%) died

receiving treatment. Among these patients, 87% were of
Caucasian descent, 4% were Asian, and 8% were African
American.
Efficacy

First, we determined the PSA response. Of 24 patients, 18
(75%; 95% CI, 0.53-0.90) had a maximum PSA decrease
30% according to the proposed study protocol (Fig. 2).
The range of response duration for these 18 patients was
from 0 to 21.6 months (median, 5.6 months) compared
with 3.2 months in a reported historic cohort that
received bicalutamide alone.19 Of these 18 patients, the
duration for the 30% PSA drop ranged from 0.3 to 34
months; the earliest starting time was at 0.3 months after
baseline. Of the 24 patients, 15 (62.5%; 95% CI, 0.410.81) had PSA decrease 50%.
In addition to the PSA response, we also evaluated the
response according to RECIST criteria (Table 2). Of all 24
patients, 1 (4%) had a complete response (95% CI, 0.1%21%), 4 (17%) had a partial response (95% CI, 5%-37%),
14 (58%) had stable disease (95% CI, 37%-78%), 4
(17%) had progressive disease (95% CI, 5%-37%), and 1
(4%) had missing values (Table 2).
For updated survival status with data cutoff on February 2015, 11 patients (46%) were still alive, and 13
(54%) had died. Two patients died of other causes, and
11 died of progressive disease. The Kaplan-Meier curve
(Fig. 3, top) reveals that the median overall survival was

Figure 2. This is a waterfall plot of prostate-specific antigen(PSA) response for all patients. Of 24 patients who were treated
on the study, 18 patients (75%; 95% confidence interval, 0.530.90) had a maximum PSA decrease 30%, and 15 (62.5%; 95%
confidence interval, 0.41-0.81) had a PSA decrease 50% (only
23 patients plotted as 1 patient did not have 2 time-point PSA
values before disenrollment from the trial).

28 months (95% CI, 14.1-42.7 months), and the median
progression-free survival was 9.4 months (95% CI, 4.025.0 months) (Fig. 3, bottom) compared with 5.8 months
for bicalutamide alone in the historic cohort.18
Two patients (8%) did not have measurable disease
except for rising PSA values at study entry and did not
have follow-up imaging studies as specified by the protocol. On the basis of the protocol, progression-free survival
was defined as the time between registration and disease
progression or death that included PSA progression.
Therefore, both patients were included in the final
progression-free survival analysis. Five patients had early
withdrawal from the clinical trial: 1 withdrew the consent
form, 1 declined follow-up imaging, 1 died from narcotic
overdose, and 1 was lost to follow-up and had an aortic
aneurysm repair, resulting in automatic withdrawal from
the study.
Toxicities

All patients who received treatment were evaluated for
toxic effects. All observed toxicities are summarized in
Table 3. Thirteen of 24 patients (54.2%; 95% CI,
0.328-0.745) had grade 3 toxicity, and 1 of 24 (4.2%;
95% CI, 0.001-0.211) had grade 4 toxicity. Two patients
discontinued treatment secondary to toxicity. Most hematologic toxicities were mild, with 1 episode of grade 3 neutropenia, 2 episodes of grade 3 anemia, and 1 episode of
grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Two patients developed grade
3 lymphopenia while on treatment. One patient had grade
Cancer

June 15, 2016

4 nonneutropenic sepsis, and 1 had nonneutropenic grade
3 pneumonia.
Of the nonhematologic toxicities (Table 3), the
most common adverse events were grade 3 oral mucositis
(4 patients) and hyperglycemia (2 patients). These symptoms improved after an everolimus dose reduction. Other
significant toxicity included 1 patient with grade 3 pneumonitis attributed to everolimus and another with a grade
3 thromboembolic incident.
We also investigated the association between grade
2 hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia and PSA and RECIST response. The Fisher
exact test indicated that there was no association between
those grade 2 toxicities in terms of a PSA response of
30% or 50% (P 5 1.0) because of the small sample size of
7 patients. According to RECIST criteria, all 5 patients
who had grade 2 or 3 hyperglycemia achieved stable disease. There was 1 patient each with grade 2 hypertriglyceridemia and grade 2 hypercholesteremia.
DISCUSSION
This single-institution, single-arm, phase 2 study with a
lead-in safety phase was conducted to assess the efficacy
and tolerability of everolimus combined with bicalutamide in 24 men who had CRPC. The trial indicated
encouraging clinical activity, with a PSA response (a
decrease 30%) observed in 75% patients who received
the combination therapy of an AR agent (bicalutamide)
and an mTOR inhibitor (everolimus). However, this regimen also was associated with significant toxicity: 14 of 24
patients (58.3%) experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicity.
The results of this study contrast with what was
reported in an earlier clinical trial by Nakabayashi et al,20
who observed that adding everolimus for disease that was
resistant to bicalutamide was ineffective in patients with
CRPC. The major difference between these 2 trials is that
31 patients (86%) in the earlier trial had previously received
treatment with bicalutamide for a median duration of 7.4
1901

months when everolimus was added.20 The response rate
to bicalutamide alone in patients with CRPC was <25%,
and the duration of response to bicalutamide was 3.1
months.19 Therefore, in the trial by Nakabayshi et al, by
the time everolimus was added, almost all patients had already developed resistance to bicalutamide. In other words,
functionally, in their clinical trial, the treatment was equivalent to inhibiting the mTOR pathway as a single modality.
Considering our previous findings that inhibition of the
mTOR pathway up-regulated the AR pathway and PSA
production, it was not surprising that only 2 of 36 patients
had a PSA response 50%. A more recent study reported a
PSA response rate (a 50% decrease from baseline) of
56.9% with bicalutamide alone for patients with nonmetastatic CRPC.21 Only 2 patients (8%) in our population
had nonmetastatic CRPC. Therefore, the response rate of
our patients should be closer to that of the historic control
cohort (25%).3,5
The response rate observed in the current study was
comparable to that observed with newer agents targeting
the androgen signaling pathway. In a study with abiraterone in patients with chemotherapy-naive CRPC, a PSA
1902

reduction 50% from baseline was observed in 62% of
patients.22 In another study with enzalutamide in a similar
population of chemotherapy-naive patients with CRPC, a
PSA decline 50% from baseline was observed in 78% of
patients.23 However, despite the addition of enzalutamide
to the repertoire of treatment for CRPC, the drug was not
yet available in much of the world; and, because of cost, it
may not be available to many patients. Therefore, this
bicalutamide and everolimus combination would be a
potentially cost-effective option.
One major strength of this bench-to-bedside clinical
trial is the design, which was based on our previous, strong
preclinical studies. Everolimus is a novel oral derivative of
rapamycin. At the cellular and molecular levels, mTOR is a
key and highly conservative serine-threonine kinase; it is present in all cells and is a central regulator of protein synthesis
and, ultimately, cell growth, cell proliferation, angiogenesis,
and cell survival. Studies in both cancer cell lines and animal
models have demonstrated that treatment with rapamycin
delays but does not completely prevent tumor growth.24,25
Incomplete growth inhibition with rapamycin is because of
the stimulation of AR expression and transcriptional activity

in CaP cells lines.26 Rapamycin-induced AR transcriptional
activity promotes cell growth in CaP, and inhibition of this
activity prevents the recurrence of cell growth observed in the
presence of rapamycin. This activity is observed in both
androgen-dependent and androgen-independent sublines of
CaP cells, although bicalutamide has no effect on the growth
of CRPC cells as a single agent.
Although this clinical trial demonstrated promising
clinical activity, the protocol was also associated with significant toxicity. Fifty-eight percent (14 of 24 patients)
developed grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Most of these toxicities
were attributed to everolimus, because the patients

profile of everolimus in this study is similar to that
reported in the treatment of patients with kidney cancer,
more patients develop grade 3 and 4 toxicities (58.3% vs
19%).27 One possible explanation is that more patients at
an advanced age were recruited for this study. The median
age of patients in this study was 71.1 years (range, 53.087.0 years), compared with 61 years in the kidney cancer
trial. Another possibility is that ADT and antiandrogen
receptor therapy sensitize patients to everolimus. A third
possibility is that bicalutamide has changed the drug metabolism of everolimus. Both bicalutamide and everolimus are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4
(CYP3A4), and competitive inhibition can occur when
the 2 drugs are combined.28
Increases in serum glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol at toxicity grade 2 have been associated with
response and outcome in other cancers.29-31 These
changes were considered a pharmacodynamics measure
for mTOR pathway inhibition and might have potential
implications for vascular risk in these patients. In our
study, there were too few patients in each category to draw
any conclusion about the correlation between responses to
grade 2 hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia,
and hyperglycemia. With this limited number of patients,
further analysis may not yield any meaningful conclusion.
Like most phase 2 clinical trials, 1 major limitation
of this study is its small sample size. Hence, any random
events can dramatically change the final response rate.
However, the patient number was decided based on the
preclinical data and historic controls. All patients were enrolled based on eligibility criteria to avoid selection bias.
Even with this small number of participants, the response
data suggest that this combination is indeed effective in
CRPC.
In summary, combination therapy with everolimus
and bicalutamide represents a promising new area of treatment for patients with bicalutamide-naive CRPC. A
randomized phase 3 trial with everolimus in combination
with antiandrogen therapy in CRPC is warranted. However, because of significant toxicity, modification of the
study design is needed. One option is to reduce the everolimus dose, because toxicity improved in the vast majority
of patients after the everolimus dose, but not the bicalutamide dose, was reduced. Because newer antiandrogen
therapies with abiraterone and enzalutamide are more
effective than bicalutamide in CRPC, a modified clinical
trial design with everolimus in combination with abiraterone or enzalutamide can also be considered.
