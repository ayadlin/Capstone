ABSTRACT
Side population (SP) cells are an enriched source of cancer-initiating cells with
stemness characteristics, generated by increased ABC transporter activity, which
has served as a unique hallmark for multiple myeloma (MM) stem cell studies. Here
we isolated and identified MM SP cells via Hoechst 33342 staining. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that SP cells possess abnormal cell cycle, clonogenicity, and high
drug efflux characteristics, all of which are features commonly seen in stem cells.
Interestingly, we found that bortezomib, As2O3, and melphalan all affected apoptosis
and clonogenicity in SP cells. We followed by characterizing the miRNA signature of
MM SP cells and validated the specific miR-451 target tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) gene
to reveal that it activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in MM SP cells. Inhibition of
miR-451 enhanced anti-myeloma novel agents’ effectiveness, through increasing cells
apoptosis, decreasing clonogenicity, and reducing MDR1 mRNA expression. Moreover,
the novel specific PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling inhibitor S14161 displayed its prowess
as a potential therapeutic agent by targeting MM SP cells. Our findings offer insights
into the mechanisms regulating MM SP cells and provide a novel strategy to overcome
resistance to existing therapies against myeloma.

marker is still one of the most controversial issues. Side
population (SP) cells, first described by Goodell et al.[9],
are a subset of enriched progenitor cells exhibiting stemlike phenotypes with a distinct low Hoechst 33342, which
has been widely used as a unique source for studying CSC
when specific markers are unavailable. Even though a few
studies have previously explored the stem-like properties
and tumorigenicity of SP cells in comparison to the main
population (MP) cells, an understanding of MM SP cells
remain elusive [5, 10-13].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of regulatory
non-coding RNAs approximately 22 nucleotides in
length and function primarily by targeting specific
mRNA sequences [14]. MiRNAs have emerged as
important regulators of CSCs, which lead to the initiation,
development, and progression of many cancers [15, 16].

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal B-cell
malignancy with terminally differentiated plasma cells.
Despite remarkable progress made in the biology and
treatment of the disease, it is still incurable [1, 2]. It has
long been postulated that a small population of cancer
stem cells (CSCs) persist in bone marrow niches resulting
in the development of refractory clones and disease
relapse [3].
Previous groups have successively described various
CSC phenotypes in MM, including CD138-/CD34- with
memory B-cells (CD19+/CD27+) [4, 5], CD138-/CD19+
cells with cytoplasmic light chain-restricted (LCR) cells
[6], CD19-/CD45low-/CD38high/CD138+ [7], and
CD138+ cell [8]. However, the distinct myeloma CSC

The signaling pathway components regulating normal
stem cell self-renewal are commonly aberrantly activated
in many human cancers, serving as potential therapeutic
targets. The signaling pathways are ideal candidates
for miRNA-mediated regulation due to the sharp dosesensitive nature of regulatory effects [17]. In the case of
MM SP cells, however, miRNAs serving as nodes of the
cell signaling pathways are yet defined. Therefore, the
goal of this study was to identify and investigate stemlike cell properties of MM SP cells through modulating
miRNAs involved in the relevant signaling pathways so to
advance development of novel and effective MM therapies
targeting SP cells.

We next examined the self-renewal capacity of
SP cells. We found SP cells to have high clonegenicity,
requiring only 200 cells/plate to successfully grow into
colonies (Fig. 1B). After 14 days in culture, SP cells
generated larger and around 3 times as many the number
of colonies derived from MP cells either in NCI-H929
or KMS-11 cell lines, demonstrating that SP cells have a
stronger self-renewal and proliferative abilities.
In MM, the immunophenotyping of CSC is still
a controversial topic [4, 5, 12, 13]. We stained the cells
with CD38, CD138, CD20, and CD19 antibodies to
characterize the immunophenotypes of NCI-H929 and
KMS-11. Consistent with previous studies [13], we
observed both CD138- and CD138+ expression on SP and
MP cells, with no significant difference in expression level
between the two populations. We found no significant
difference in CD20 and CD19 expression between SP and
MP cells (Fig. 1C).
ABCB1 (MDR1), ABCC1 (MRP1), ABCC2
(MRP2), ABCC4 (MRP4), and ABCG2 (BRCP) are the
main transporters in multidrug resistance (MDR) family
known to possess the ability to exclude drugs as well as
being present in CSCs. We detected expression of these
transporters in SP and MP sorted from NCI-H929 and
KMS-11 cells. ABCG2 transcripts were significantly
enhanced in SP cells in comparison to MP cells in both
myeloma cell lines. However, the expressions of ABCB1
was slight enhanced in SP cells compared to MP sorted
from NCI-H929 cells, while ABCC1, ABCC2, and
ABCC4 were somewhat reduced in both cell lines (Fig.
1D). And then, the ABCG2 protein expression level
were confirmed by western blot assay (Fig. 1D). This
observation is consistent with the concept of ABCG2
transporter being the most specific SP marker from the
MDR family [18].
Recently, detection of ALDH activity has been
touted as a marker of hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells [19]. To determine whether SP cells contain the
high ALDH expression as well, we used the fluorescent
Aldefluor assay to exam ALDH activity. We observed a
significantly increase in Aldefluor activity in NCI-H929
SP cells (57.8 %) and KMS-11 SP cells (24.7%) than
compared to corresponding MP cells (Fig. 1E).
To evaluate tumorigenicity of SP cells in mice,
a total of 1X105 of SP or MP cells was injected
subcutaneously into NOD/SCID mice with 6 mice per
group per time points. We observed two out of six mice
injected with SP cells developed subcutaneous tumors
with great tumor mass, whereas mice injected with MP
cells did not develop any tumor (Fig. 1F). These results,
combined with our previous studies, showed only a
40% tumor formation rate in NCI-H929 cells. We thus
speculated that the tumorigenicity of NCI-H929 derives
from SP cells since only SP fractions eventually developed
tumors with the latency and tumor mass being consistent
with previously reported data [8, 13].

RESULTS
SP cells existed in MM cell lines and primary MM
cells
To isolate and provide evidence that the SP cells
exist in myeloma cells, we analyzed a panel of cell lines,
including NCI-H929, RPMI 8226, KMS-11, LP-1, U266,
and SKO, as well as seven primary myeloma cells with
Hoechst 33342 staining. Cells were also incubated in the
presence of verapamil (100 μM), a chemical inhibitor of
the ABC protein family of transporters, which inhibits the
efflux of Hoechst as the negative control for SP cell. The
MM cell lines were found to contain of SP cells, presented
as a distinct ‘‘tail’’ in the flow cytometry analysis
(Supplemental Fig. 1A and 1B), from 0.5%~10.3% and
patients’ samples ranged a minor population of SP from
0.04%~2.0% (Supplemental Fig. 1C and 1D). We then
utilized NCI-H929 and KMS-11 cell lines, both of which
showed a reliable and stable detected SP cell population,
to further investigate the functional characteristics of SP
cells.

SP cells endowed with distinct stem cell
characteristics in MM
SP cells have inherent properties that distinguish
them from MP cells from their less-differentiated
progeny. To determine if MM stem-like cells exist in a
relatively quiescent state, SP and MP cells isolated from
the NCI-H929 and KMS-11 cell lines were examined
for their cell cycle status. We found that NCI-H929 SP
cells contained a significantly higher percentage cells
in G1/G0 phase (58.19%) compared to MP cells, which
only contained 8.77% of cells in G1/G0 phase (Fig. 1A).
Approximately 35.71% and 6.1% of SP cells were in S and
G2 phases, respectively, compared to 57.74% and 33.49%
in MP cells. Similarly, a high percentage cells in G1/G0
phase were detected in SP cells in comparison to MP cells
of KMS-11 cell line (Fig. 1A).

SP cells exhibit drug resistance

at least two-fold and statistically significant difference (p
< 0.05) in expression, 43 miRNAs were identified in total.
Ten of which were upregulated and 33 were downregulated
in SP cells compared with those in MP cells (Table 1). Of
these potential distinct miRNA expression pattern, miR451, miR-144 and miR-150, were of interest because
they have been reported to be involved in pathological
mechanism of CSCs [20, 21]. The expression of these
three miRNAs were further confirmed by qRT-PCR based
on 2-ΔΔCt methods (Fig. 3).

To determine whether classical or novel clinically
active agents mediate SP cell viability, SP or MP cells
were treated with anti-myeloma drugs bortezomib, As2O3,
dexamethasone, melphalan, or doxorubicin with increasing
concentrations for 24 and 48 hours. Cell viability was then
measured by CCK8 assays. As shown in Fig. 2A, active
agents significantly decreased the viability of SP and MP
cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We observed
at least two-fold a half-maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) concentration in inhibitory rates of SP cells
compared to MP cells in all test drugs. This may be one
of the obvious triggers for relapse, since conventional
treatment fails to affect the active stem-like MM cells.
To determine the effects of these agents on reducing
the number of SP cells, we assessed the SP and MP
fraction after 48 hour treatment with the various drugs.
We found that As2O3 and melphalan could significantly
decrease the percentage of SP cells. However, in contrast
to Nara’s study, which may be due to the different
myeloma cell type, bortezomib only slightly reduced SP
fraction even in relatively high concentrations (Fig. 2B)
[8]. Dexamethasone and doxorubicin did not affect SP
cells. All these drugs decreased MP fraction compared to
control.
We next evaluated the effect of the drugs on growth
of SP cells. Similar results from NCI-H929 and KMS11 SP and MP cells were obtained. Approximately 50%
decrease in colony number and formation were observed
in presence of bortezomib and As2O3, while nearly no
colony formation in cells treated with melphalan (Fig.
2C). These results indicate that these drugs hampered
growth of potential SP cells, whereas SP and MP cells
was unchanged by treatment with dexamethasone or
doxorubicin.
Subsequently, we evaluated the effects of the drugs
on the SP cell cycle. None of the drugs altered the cell
cycle distribution in SP cells compared to controls (data
not shown). Apoptosis by using annexin V-binding assay
in SP cells treated by bortezomib, As2O3, or melphalan
increased dramatically in a time- and dose-dependent
manner, whereas dexamethasone or doxorubicin treatment
failed to induce apoptosis in SP cells (Fig. 2D). Therefore,
we speculated that the ability of bortezomib, As2O3,
or melphalan to decrease clonogenicity to confer drug
resistance in SP cells was derived from apoptosis.

Differential expression of miRNAs regulated
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways in SP cells
It is well known that genes do not work in isolation.
Instead, complex molecular networks and cellular
pathways are often involved in disease pathogenesis [22,
23]. We therefore performed pathway analysis of the
predicted targets using KEGG to define the biological
networks affected by differentially expressed miRNAs
and their targets in SP cells. The list of the top pathways
highly related to SP cells ranked by the enrichment p <
0.005 is presented in Supplemental Table 1 (FDR < 0.05).
Out of all these pathways, which have been successively
reported to play a determinant role in CSCs, PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling appears to act as a crucial pathway in
disease progression and development of therapeutic
resistance [24, 25]. However, the role of PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling in the maintenance of myeloma CSCs
has not been clarified. We next confirmed the fidelity
and reliability of the representative target genes located
in PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by western blot analysis.
Our results showed PI3K/Akt/mTOR proteins, p-S6
and p-P70S6K, to be significantly upregulated in SP
cells compared with those of MP cells (Supplemental
Fig. 2). Therefore, we speculated that PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway may be regulated by specific miRNAs to exert its
biological effects in MM SP cells.

miR-451 enhanced the potentiated drug synergism
effect in SP cell
To evaluate whether any of the 43 aberrantly
expressed miRNAs previously identified in SP cells
could target the core regulators in PI3K/Akt/mTOR, we
used computational methods to predict the TSC1 and
CAB39 which might be targeted by miR-451, expression
in this pathway. Notably, miR-451 has been previously
confirmed to be upregulated in SP cells (Fig. 3) and
shown to maintain CSC properties in other diseases [21].
To examine the effects of miR-451 in MM SP cells, qRTPCR confirmed a remarkable downregulation of miR-451
expression in SP cells after transfection of the mature
sequence of miR-451 inhibitor (miR-451-inh) at 100nM
(Supplemental Fig. 3).

Unexpectedly there was no difference in cell
proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle status, or clonogenicity
between SP and MP cells from NCI-H929 and KMS11 at any time point after transfection of miR-451-inh
oligonucleotides (data not shown). Intriguingly, miR-451
might have a potential anti-myeloma SP cell synergistic
effect against CSC characteristics with bortezomib, As2O3,
and melphalan treatments when SP cells were transduced
with miR-451 inhibitor. Similar results were observed
from NCI-H929 and KMS-11 cell lines for after 48 hour
treatment. Representative NCI-H929 SP cells results are
shown in Figure 4. In apoptosis assay, SP cells transfected
with miR-451-inh showed a significant increase in
apoptosis compared to treatment with each agent alone,
indicating that the reduced levels of miR-451 enhanced
the efficiency of bortezomib, As2O3, or melphalan on SP
cells (Fig. 4A, p < 0.05). Similarly, combination of miR451-inh with anti-myeloma drugs significantly decreased
colony formation compared to treatment with each agent
alone, indicating that the low levels of miR-451 restrained
SP cell proliferation (Fig. 4B, p < 0.05).
One of the underlying mechanisms for such
drug synergism effect might be associated with ABC
transporters. As shown in Fig. 4C, qRT-PCR data shows
a near 50% decrease of ABCB1 in sorted SP cells after
treatment with miR-451-inh compared to controls. Only
slight changes were detected in ABCG2, ABCC2 and
ABCC4 mRNA expression of SP cells (Supplemental Fig.
4). These results suggests that miR-451 enhanced the drug
synergistic effect in SP cells might contribute to affect the
ABC transporter pump function by regulating its family,
especially in ABCB1, but further function research is
needed to confirm this result.

whether abnormally expressed miR-451 could target
TSC1, which has a highly conserved binding site in the
3’UTR of TSC1 predicted by miRanda, and TargetScan,
a luciferase reporter assay was used to study. The activity
of TSC1 luciferase was blocked by overexpression of
miR-451 compared with control. This was abrogated
by mutation at the miR-451 binding site, demonstrating
a direct effect of miR-451 on the 3’UTR of TSC1 (Fig.
5A). Furthermore, inhibition of miR-451 led to an increase
in transcription and translation of TSC1 in SP cells (Fig.
5B and 5C). Moreover, inhibition of miR-451 reduced
downstream effectors, phospho-S6 and phospho-4EBP1,
by inhibiting PIK3/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in SP
cells (Fig. 5D).

A novel mTOR inhibitor agent S14161 targets
MM SP cells specificity
From the results so far, it is clear that the PIK3/
Akt/mTOR pathway may be important for maintaining
SP cell features. To confirm this, we examined the effect
of inhibiting PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway on SP cells.
Rapamycin, a specific classical inhibitor of mTOR, was
firstly tested for its ability to reduce the SP fraction in
NCI-H929 cells. Treatment with rapamycin at 5μM for
three days, resulted in a significant decrease in SP fraction,
from 1.54% to 0.28% (Supplemental Fig. 5). Recently, a
small chemical compound, S14161, was identified as
a PI3K inhibitor. S14161 displayed no gross toxicity at
concentrations up to 500 mg/kg in vivo, making it a good
candidate for use in myeloma and leukemia treatment
in preclinical activity [26]. Thus, we were in particular
interested in testing S14161 against SP cells. As shown
in Fig. 6A, S14161 drastically reduced the SP fraction
within NCI-H929 cells in a dose-dependent manner
after 72-hour treatment. The ability of the S14161 to
decrease the SP fraction was at least partially due to its
ability to preferentially inhibit the SP cells. To support
this, we treated NCI-H929 SP and MP cells with S14161
(0~12.5μM) for 24 and 48 hours and evaluated MM cell
viability using CCK-8 assay. The SP cells treated for 24

miR-451 targeted TSC1 gene to regulate PIK3/
Akt/mTOR signaling in SP cells
The putative corresponding target TSC1 was of
particular interest due to its known function in a wide array
of cellular processes through negative control of mTORC1
involving the PIK3/Akt/mTOR regulation. To evaluate

cell lines (Fig. 6B). We further observed that SP cells
after treatment with 2.5~7.5μM S14161 for 24 or 48
hours, showed increased apoptosis rate in a time- and
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6C). In addition, S14161
dramatically reduced the colony forming capacity of SP
cells in comparison to control (Fig. 6D). Because S14161
decreased levels of D-cyclins, we tested the effects of
S14161 on cell-cycle progression. In contrast to previous
report [26] and MP cells data from our study (not shown),
we measured that S14161 at 5μM induced SP cell cycle
arrest at G2/M phase, with a corresponding reduction in
the number of G0 quiescent cells in a time-dependent
manner (Fig. 6E), which might be mediated others
mechanism to effect cell cycle on SP cells. Furthermore,
S14161 exhibited synergistic apoptotic effect when
administered in conjunction with miR-451 (Fig. 6F).

Taken together, the effect of the PI3K inhibitor S14161
in SP cells and the synergistic activity with the miR-451
inhibitor support the notion that S14161 may have potent
activity not only in myeloma cells also in MM SP cells.

DISCUSSION
Although there are several viewpoints on the stemlike properties within MM cells, the definitive MM CSCs
phenotype/markers are still under investigation [27]. In
this study, we used the eff﻿﻿lux of Hoechst dye to identify
the SP phenotype and isolate MM cancer stem-like cells.
We first identified SP cells which remained
consistently a small between various experiments
and over a panel of myeloma cells. As expected, no
distinctive phenotypic features were identified between
SP and MP cells. Consistent with previous studies [5,

10, 13], we observed CSC properties (i.e. cell cycle
status, clonogenicity, and high drug efflux capacity) in
SP cells. In cell cycle analysis, SP cells contain larger
percentage of quiescent population than MP cells, which
may be one of the reasons for the SP-induced drug
resistance. Furthermore, we confirmed that SP cells
contain clonogenic cells with high proliferative ability,
a distinguished property of CSCs for producing lessdifferentiated progeny and undergoing self-renewal [5],
resulting in generation of a significant proportion of cells
in comparison with MP cells. Although the proliferation
rates were low compared to others reports [8, 13], it might
be due to the low amount of SP cells used per plate for
colony formation assay. Moreover, we still observed a
significantly higher tumorigenicity in SP cells compared
to MP cells through our in vitro experiments and in vivo

study of SP cell tumorigenicity, though with limited data
due to the rare numbers of SP cells from FACS. Combined
with previous studies [5, 13], we have generated a
solid foundation in confirming SP cells as a source of
tumorigenicity of myeloma for CSC studies.
Many studies have demonstrated CSCs as an
important cause of drug resistance and relapse due to
their regulation of ABC activity in drug efflux [5, 10, 13].
Similarly, we observed an elevated expression of ABCG2
in SP cells, confirming ABCG2 as a molecular marker of
SP phenotype [18]. We also observed high levels of ALDH
activity in SP cells, which has been previously shown to
also be high in myeloma stem-like cells [5, 28]. However,
ALDH was not an eligible marker for myeloma CSCs
in our study since over 50% of SP cells fail to meet the
criteria for being defined as CSCs.

The CSC hypothesis states that a small subset of
cells with in a cancer population is intrinsically more
resistant to therapy than the rest of the tumor cells [6].
Previous studies have reported CD138-/CD19+/CD20+/
CD27+ MM stem cells to be resistant to dexamethasone,
lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide and bortezomib [5].
However, in other studies, MM SP cells were susceptible
to lenalidomide [13] or bortezomib treatment [8]. Here
we expanded the drug resistance analysis to a panel of
active clinical agents and showed that SP cells were more
resistant to bortezomib, As2O3, dexamethasone, melphalan,
and doxorubicin compared to MP cells. Notably, we
show SP cells to be susceptible to bortezomib, As2O3,
and melphalan treatment as seen from the decreased
SP fraction, significantly increased SP cells apoptosis,
as well as the lowered percentage of SP population and
clonogenicity at clinically achievable concentrations.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to characterize and compare miRNA signatures of MM SP
cells with MP cells. Of the abnormally regulated miRNAs,
we looked at the molecular mechanisms involved in miR451-mediated effects. Cells expressing miR-451 has
been demonstrated to exhibit CSCs properties in colon
carcinoma [21, 29]. Although miR-451 has yet been
proven directly effective against myeloma SP cells in
proliferation, apoptosis, or self-renewal, we found miR451 to potentiate the effects of bortizomib, As2O3, and
melphalan through enhancing apoptosis and inhibit clonal
sphere formation in SP cells.
We further found that treatment with miR-451
inhibitor decreased the expression of MDR1 mRNA
expression in MM SP cells, which may confer its
synergistic effects. Previous study reported that miR-451
increased MDR1 expression in parental cell line A2780
[30]. Taken together, our results suggests that the effects
of miR-451 on MDR1 expression appear to modulate antimyeloma agents’ effectiveness by inhibiting the expression
of certain transcriptional factors involved in suppressing
MDR1 gene activation. The precise mechanisms require
further investigation.
Until now, several pathways, such as the hedgehog
[10] and Notch pathways [6], have been shown to be
involved with maintaining myeloma stem cell properties.
The role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in the maintenance
of CSCs has been addressed in other tumors, but the
conclusions of these reports are controversial [25, 31].
We identified the effects of miR-451 on the activation of
the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and its downstream targets
to stimulate stemness features through direct targeting
of TSC1. Disruption of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling by
constitutive miR-451 expression alters the activity of
pathways downstream of TSC1, including reduced S6
and 4EBP1 phosphorylation. Thus, miR-451 targets TSC1
to mediate PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, which plays an
essential role in myeloma stem cell biology.
A novel specific inhibitor, S14161, inhibits
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

D-cyclin transactivation via the PI3K signaling pathway
to exert anti-myeloma activity [26], while displaying
no gross toxicity at concentrations up to 500 mg/kg in
an in vivo assay, making it a probable drug candidate.
More importantly for myeloma SP cells, S14161 exerted
multiple actions including directly decreasing SP fraction,
inhibiting SP proliferation, increasing apoptosis, inducing
cell cycle progression, as well as synergizing with low
miR-451 expression. Taken together, these suggest a
significant potential target for myeloma stem and cancer
cell therapeutics. The overexpression of D-cyclins
contributes to the pathogenesis and chemoresistance of
MM [32]. Our previous studies have demonstrated the
ABCG2 activity of SP cells and the MDR1 mediated
miR-451 effects. Collectively, we believe that S14161 may
down-regulate D-cyclins via a MDR pathway mediated
by ABCG2 or MDR1, which controls or bypasses these
events to affect SP features.
In summary, our results demonstrate that MM SP
cells exhibit stemness, and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
is activated in SP cells. Regulating TSC1 expression by
miR-451 and related downstream targets (Fig. 6G) may be
relevant to the pathophysiology of the disease, and miR451 may serve as a potential therapeutic target.
