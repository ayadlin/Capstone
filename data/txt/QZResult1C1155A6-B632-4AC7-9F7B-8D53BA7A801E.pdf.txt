ABSTRACT
Lenalidomide modulates the host immune response against myeloma via
multiple actions. Although these effects have been elucidated in vitro, the central
action of lenalidomide-mediated anti-myeloma immune response in vivo is not
clear. To investigate its immune action in vivo, we selected the murine myeloma cell
line 5TGM1, which is resistant to direct tumoricidal effects of lenalidomide in vitro
and in immunodeficient mice, but sensitive to lenalidomide treatment in 5TGM1bearing immunocompetent mice. Depletion of CD4+ T cells, but not NK cells, B cells,
or CD8+ T cells, deprived lenalidomide of its therapeutic effects on 5TGM1-bearing
immunocompetent mice. Lenalidomide significantly increased the numbers of IFNγ-secreting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but had no effects on NK cells and B cells in this
mouse model. Lenalidomide slightly decreased the number of CD25+Foxp3+ T cells
but increased perforin expression in CD8+ T cells in vivo. Using this mouse model
for investigation of anti-tumor immune action of lenalidomide, we demonstrated
that lenalidomide facilitated a type-1 anti-tumor immune response in vivo. The CD4+
T cell subset may play a critical role in the lenalidomide-mediated anti-myeloma
immune response in vivo.

their cytokine secretion but also by decreasing IL-6
secretion in vitro. [4, 5] Lenalidomide synergistically
enhances antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
in myeloma cells. [6] All in vitro preclinical studies
suggest these dual tumoricidal and immunomodulatory
activities for lenalidomide. However, the principal
action of lenalidomide in the anti-myeloma immune
response in vivo is unclear.
The 5TGM1 myeloma cell line was initially
derived from a murine myeloma cell line, 5T, that
originated spontaneously from C57BL/KaLwRij mice
[7]. After i.v. injection of 5TGM1 cells into C57BL/
KaLwRij immunocompetent mice, 5TGM1 myeloma
cells thrived and migrated to bone marrow. Similar
to myeloma patients, the 5TGM1 myeloma mouse

INTRODUCTION
Lenalidomide (CC-5013, Revlimid) has been
approved by the Food and Drug Administration to
treat patients with multiple myeloma because it has
potent anti-myeloma activities and a better toxicity
profile than thalidomide. Lenalidomide’s anti-myeloma
mechanisms include tumoricidal, immunomodulatory,
anti-inflammatory, and anti-angiogenic properties.
The direct tumoricidal effect of lenalidomide occurs
through caspase activation and apoptosis induction.
[1] It also disrupts the stromal cell-enriched tumor
microenvironment
and
inhibits
angiogenesis.

not only by activating T and NK cells and increasing

model presented with monoclonal gammopathy and
demonstrated marrow replacement, focal osteolytic
bone lesions, hind limb paralysis, and occasional
hypercalcemia [8].
Our preliminary data showed that 5TGM1 cells
were resistant to lenalidomide in vitro and in severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice but were
sensitive to lenalidomide in an immune responsedependent manner in immunocompetent C57BL/
KaLwRij mice in vivo. Therefore, 5TGM1-bearing
C57BL/KaLwRij mice were taken as an ideal model
for investigating the anti-myeloma immune action of
lenalidomide in vivo. Here, we found that lenalidomide
failed to prolong the survival of mice after CD4+ T cell
but not CD8+ T cell, B cell, or NK cell depletion and
this was associated with a stronger Th1 response. These
results suggest that CD4+ T cells are indispensable
to a lenalidomide-mediated anti-myeloma immune
response in vivo.

5TGM1-bearing C57BL/KaLwRij mouse is an
ideal model to study the immunomodulatory
effect of lenalidomide in vivo
Due to the complicated antitumor activity of
lenalidomide, separating its effects into tumoricidal and
immunomodulatory activities is difficult, which hampers
study of its direct immunomodulatory effects in vivo.
We wanted a murine myeloma model that is resistant
to lenalidomide’s tumoricidal effect but sensitive to its
immunomodulatory effect. Through in vitro treatment
with lenalidomide of different myeloma cell lines and
analysis of proliferation and apoptosis (data not shown),
we decided to focus on 5TGM1 murine myeloma cells.
Lenalidomide at concentrations up to 100 μM for 72 hours
didn’t induce growth inhibition or apoptosis in 5TGM1
myeloma cells (Figure 1).

A 7-day culture with 100 μM lenalidomide did not
affect 5TGM1 growth or apoptosis (data not shown).
Because lenalidomide had no direct cytotoxicity on
5TGM1 cells in vitro, we next determined whether
lenalidomide had any effect on the tumor cells in vivo.
As shown in Figure 2A–2C, lenalidomide inhibited
tumor growth and prolonged survival of 5TGM1-bearing
C57BL/KaLwRij mice. Notably, 2/12 mice treated with
lenalidomide were tumor-free at post-inoculation day 90
(Figure 2B–2C, P < 0.05). However, in immunodeficient
B6-SCID mice, which lack T and B cells, lenalidomide
treatment failed to inhibit tumor growth (Figure 2D–2E,
P  >  0.05) or prolong survival of tumor-bearing mice
(Figure 2F, P > 0.05). That lenalidomide had no
direct tumoricidal effect on 5TGM1 cells in vitro
and inhibited myeloma growth in immunocompetent
but not immunodeficient mice indicates that the host
immune system must play an important role in the
anti-myeloma activity of lenalidomide in vivo and this

activity can be studied in the 5TGM1-bearing C57BL/
KaLwRij model.

NK cells are not the major effector cells for antimyeloma activity of lenalidomide in vivo
Therefore, we first investigated the importance
of NK cells in lenalidomide-mediated anti-myeloma
activity in vivo. Our study in B6-SCID mice showed that
lenalidomide had no obvious anti-myeloma effects in vivo
(Figure 2D–2F). As these SCID mice have functional NK
cells but no T and B cells, this result suggested that NK
cells may not be important for lenalidomide-mediated antimyeloma activity in vivo. After NK cells were depleted in
5TGM1-bearing C57BL/KaLwRij mice, lenalidomide still
retarded tumor growth and prolonged survival (Figure 3,
P < 0.05). Together with the finding that lenalidomide
had an anti-myeloma effect in immunocompetent but
not in B6-SCID mice, which have NK cells, these results

injections of lenalidomide (25 mg/kg/day) or equal volume of DMSO for 21 consecutive days. Serum samples were collected weekly,
and tumor burden was monitored by measuring circulating IgG2b M-protein. Concentration curves of serum IgG2b M-protein from mice

demonstrated that NK cells are not the main effector cells
of lenalidomide action in vivo.

We found that lenalidomide significantly
increased IFN-γ secretion in both CD4+ and CD8+
T cells in 5TGM1-bearing mice (Figure 5E–5F). When
lenalidomide was combined with PMA/ionomycin,
synergistic effects on IFN-γ production by CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells and expression of perforin by CD8+ T
cells were observed (Figure 5G–5H). Interestingly,
lenalidomide and PMA/ionomycin also stimulated CD8+
but not CD4+ T cells to secrete significantly more IL-4
(Figure 5G). Lenalidomide alone slightly decreased the
percentage of CD25+Foxp3+CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells
(Figure 5I). Taken together, these data clearly showed that
lenalidomide enhances the type I anti-myeloma CD4+ and
CD8+ T cell responses in vivo.

CD4+ T cells mediate the pivotal anti-myeloma
activity of lenalidomide in vivo
Next, we investigated whether the lenalidomide
immunomodulatory effect depends on T or B cell activity.
Depleting CD4+T cells significantly enhanced tumor
growth and shortened survival (Figure 4A, 4B and 4E;
P < 0.01, vs. isotype control). Depleting CD8+ T cells or
B cells did not significantly affect tumor growth or survival
(Figure 4A, 4C, 4D and 4E, P > 0.05, vs. isotype control).
These in vivo results demonstrated that CD4+ T cells but not
CD8+ or B cells are crucial in the lenalidomide-mediated
anti-myeloma immune response in vivo.

DISCUSSION

Lenalidomide facilitates a T-cell dependent type
I response in 5TGM1-bearing mice

Lenalidomide, a second-generation immunomod­
ulatory drug, exhibits antitumor activity. Lenalidomidecontaining therapeutic regimens resulted in higher
response and improved outcomes in the patients with MM
relapse or with refractory MM [10, 11]. Previous studies
demonstrated that lenalidomide had a direct tumoricidal
role by inducing apoptosis and blocking tumor cell
proliferation [12, 13]. Recent in vitro studies showed
that lenalidomide bound to cereblon and then selectively
degraded specific transcription factors — the Ikaros family
zinc finger proteins 1 and 3 (IKZF1 and IKZF3) — which
were necessary for myeloma survival [14, 15]. However,
it is essential to investigate how lenalidomide modulates
the immune response in vivo. Considering the complicated
effects of lenalidomide on tumor cells and immune
cells, the mechanistic study of immunomodulation is
limited by the availability of a suitable tumor model that
can separate these two effects. In the current study, we
found that a murine myeloma cell line, 5TGM1, was

To further understand how lenalidomide affects
immune cell function in vivo, 5TGM1-bearing mice were
sacrificed 1 week after the final lenalidomide injection
and the splenocytes were harvested, analyzed directly or
restimulated ex vivo (see below) before assay.
First the percentages of splenic CD4+ T cells, CD8+
T cells, NK cells, and B cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry. As Figure 5A shows, the percentages of both
CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells increased about 2-fold vs.
vehicle control (P < 0.01). NK cells and B cells showed
no change (P > 0.05).
After restimulation of splenocytes with lenalidomide
for 72 hours ex vivo, the B cell population showed no
significant change even when treatment was combined
with LPS (Figure 5B–5C; P > 0.05). The total number of
NK cells, including IFN-γ-secreting and IL-4-secreting
NK cells, decreased (Figure 5D; P < 0.01).

totally resistant to lenalidomide toxicity in vitro. Most
importantly, we found that lenalidomide inhibited tumor
growth and prolonged the survival of 5TGM1-bearing
C57BL/KaLwRij mice; however, it failed to inhibit tumor
growth of 5TGM1-bearing SCID mice. Those results
demonstrated that lenalidomide affect 5TGM1-bearing
mice survival in an immune response-dependent manner
only. This 5TGM1 myeloma model facilitates study of the
immunomodulatory role without the direct tumoricidal
effect of lenalidomide in vivo.
By depleting different cell populations in the
5TGM1-bearing immunocompetent mice separately,
we found that CD4+ T cells play a critical role in the
lenalidomide-mediated antitumor immune response.
Under different types of stimulation, CD4+ T cells will
differentiate into different populations, including Th1,
Th2, Th9, Th17, TfH, and regulatory T cells, to mediate
different immune responses. Lenalidomide potentiated
T cell activation in a costimulatory manner in vitro [16].
IL-2 is T cell activation hallmark and its transcription was
suppressed by IKZF3, which bound to the IL-2 promoter
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

directly [17]. Lenalidomide promoted IKZF3 degradation,
thus releasing the suppressive effect of IKZF3 on IL-2
transcription and promoting T cell activation [14, 15].
Our data showed that lenalidomide enhanced IFN-γ
production in CD4+ T cell in vitro and in vivo, suggesting
an increased Th1 response after lenalidomide treatment.
Th1 polarized immune responses are associated with
CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells and
induce tumor regression. After lenalidomide treatment,
CD8+ T cells produced more IFN-γ and perforin, which
is consistent with the enhanced Th1 response. The
cytotoxic effect of CD8+ T cells can be inhibited through
recruitment and/or conversion of natural or adaptive Tregs.
Our data showed that the number of Tregs was somewhat
decreased in tumor-bearing C57BL/KaLwRij mice after
lenalidomide treatment. An in vitro study by Luptakova
et al demonstrated that lenalidomide resulted in T cell
polarization toward a Th1 phenotype characterized by
increased IFN-γ secretion of T cells while decreasing
the number of Tregs [18], which is consistent with our
in vivo data.

The exact molecular mechanism by which
lenalidomide regulates CD4+ T cell activation and
polarization is not clear. In the absence of CD28
stimulation, lenalidomide induced IL-2, IFN-γ and
TNF-α secretion [19], suggesting that lenalidomide may
activate T cells by mimicking the costimulatory signaling.
Furthermore, LeBlance et al found that lenalidomide
increased tyrosine phosphorylation in the CD28 receptor
intracellular domain in the absence of costimulatory
molecules [20].
Although cereblon is essential for lenalidomidemediated direct tumoricidal activity against myeloma,
it also mediated T cell activation by lenalidomide
or its analogues because knockdown of cereblon in
primary human T cells abrogates drug-induced IL-2
expression  [21]. Furthermore, lenalidomide promoted
the cereblon-dependent destruction of Ikaros proteins
[15]. IKZF1 (Ikaros) directly bound to the promoter
region of T-bet, the master regulator of Th1 cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

differentiation, and suppressed IFN-γ production
and promoted Th2 polarization [22]. IKZF2 (Helios)
directly bound to Foxp3 promoter and up-regulated
Foxp3 expression, which results Treg differentiation
[23]. IL-2 transcription was suppressed by IKZF3
through binding of its promoter. Thus, although it is not
known whether lenalidomide can degrade IZKF2 as well
as IZKF1 and IZKF3, it seems that lenalidomide can
promote T cell activation by down-regulation of IZKF1,
polarize Th1  response by degradation of IZKF3, and
may slightly decrease Treg by down-regulation of the
Ikaros family.
Previous studies showed that lenalidomide activated
NK cells and enhanced NK cell function in MM patients,
and its effects on NK cells were dependent on CD4+T cells
and IL-2 secretion [24, 25]. Our results demonstrated that
NK cells were not a therapeutic target of lenalidomide.
Therefore, lenalidomide may affect NK cell function in
the presence of CD4+ T cells.

scintillation beta-counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical
Sciences, Shelton, CT). The data are expressed as the
percentage of the DMSO control value.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

An annexin V-binding assay was used to detect the
induction of apoptosis. Cells were seeded in 48-well plates
with different concentrations of lenalidomide for 72 hours.
To quantify the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis,
cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and then resuspended in 1X binding buffer
at 1 × 106 cells/mL. Subsequently, 100 μl cell suspension
solution was transferred into a 5-mL tube and 5 μl annexin
V and PI were added. The tubes were gently vortexed and
incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
Then 300 μl 1X binding buffer was added and analyzed
immediately using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The number of apoptotic cells
was determined by counting annexin V-positive cells.

Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center approved the study.
The 5TGM1 myeloma cell line was derived from 5T
murine myeloma that spontaneously arose in C57BL/
KaLwRij mice and was cultured in Iscove’s modified
Dulbecco’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals),

by ELISA.

Drugs and reagents
Lenalidomide was provided by Celgene (Summit,
NJ) and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a
stock concentration of 0.5 M. FITC-conjugated annexin
V was purchased from Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame,
CA). Propidium iodide (PI), lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
ionomycin, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Atlanta
Biologicals (Norcross, CA). 3H-thymidine was purchased
from Amersham (Arlington Heights, IL).

Flow cytometry
An aliquot of freshly isolated cells from the spleen
of lenalidomide/DMSO treated C57BL/KaLwRij mice
was incubated with fluorescent isothiocyanate (FITC)-,
phycoerythrin (PE)-, or allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CD4, CD8, B220, or
NK1.1 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) for 30 minutes at 4°C,
and then washed twice and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Another aliquot of freshly isolated cells was incubated with
1 μM lenalidomide or DMSO (vehicle control) with and
without LPS (100ng/mL) or ionomycin (1 μg/mL) plus
PMA (300 ng/mL) at 37°C for 72 hours. These cells were
then subjected to CD4, CD8, B220, or NK1.1 cell surface
staining, and then treated using a Cytofix/Cytoperm kit
(BD Biosciences) for intracellular staining for IL-4, IFN-γ,
perforin or Foxp3 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA).

In vivo therapeutic effect of lenalidomide
Mice were challenged intravenously with 2 × 106
5TGM1 myeloma cells. Three weeks later, when myeloma
growth was established, mice received intraperitoneal
lenalidomide (25 mg/kg) or equal volume vehicle
control daily for 21 consecutive days. Tumor burden
was monitored by measuring serum IgG2b M-protein by
ELISA. Mice were euthanized when moribund or when
hind-leg paralysis developed.
