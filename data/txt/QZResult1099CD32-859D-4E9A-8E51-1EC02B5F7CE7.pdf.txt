Abstract
Therapy resistance and poor outcome in prostate cancer is
associated with increased expression of cyclin D1. Androgens
promote DNA double-strand break repair to reduce DNA damage,
and cyclin D1 was also shown to enhance DNA damage repair
(DDR). In this study, we investigated the signiﬁcance of cyclin D1
in androgen-induced DDR using established prostate cancer
cells and prostate tissues from cyclin D1 knockout mice. We
demonstrate that endogenous cyclin D1 further diminished the
dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-dependent reduction of gH2AX foci
in vitro. We also show that cyclin D1 was required for the
androgen-dependent DNA damage response both in vitro and

in vivo. Furthermore, cyclin D1 was required for androgenenhanced DDR and radioresistance of prostate cancer cells. Moreover, microarray analysis of primary prostate epithelial cells from
cyclin D1-deﬁcient and wild-type mice demonstrated that most of
the DHT-dependent gene expression changes are also cyclin D1
dependent. Collectively, our ﬁndings suggest that the hormonemediated recruitment of cyclin D1 to sites of DDR may facilitate
the resistance of prostate cancer cells to DNA damage therapies
and highlight the need to explore other therapeutic approaches in
prostate cancer to prevent or overcome drug resistance. Cancer Res;

Introduction

implanted in mice (4), and cyclin D1/ mice were resistant to
transgenic tumors induced by Ras in either the skin or the
mammary gland (5, 6). Furthermore, cyclin D1 heterozygote
mice are resistant to gastrointestinal tumorigenesis induced by
the APC gene (7). Cyclin D1 participates in several noncanonical functions, promoting angiogenesis (8), cellular invasion,
and migration (9–13).
Cyclin D1 regulates the activity of more than 30 transcription
factors (14). Recently, approximately 90% of estrogen receptormediated gene expression in the mammary gland was shown to
be determined by cyclin D1 (15). The mechanism by which
cyclin D1 inhibits gene expression involves the recruitment of
cyclin D1 to transcription factor–binding sites in the context of
local chromatin, associated with the recruitment of histone
deacetylase (HDAC), which contributes to the transcriptional
repression of differentiation-inducing genes (16, 17). HDAC1,
2, 3, and 5 bind to cyclin D1 and HDACs are recruited in the
context of the local chromatin to deacetylate histone 3 lysine 9
(H3K9), which occurs contemporaneous with the recruitment
of HP1a and SUV39 (18). ChIP-ChIP studies using proximal
promoter regions on tiled arrays demonstrated cyclin D1 occupied proximal promoter elements including both E2F and nonE2F sites. Genome-wide ChIP-Seq identiﬁed cyclin D1-binding
sites at both proximal and distal genomic sites with enrichment
amongst genes regulating chromosomal stability (19). Cyclin
D1 induces gene expression in vivo, in addition to reporter
assays (1, 20). Although cyclin D1 has been shown to regulate
synthetic androgen receptor (AR)-responsive reporter genes in
transformed cells, the role of cyclin D1 in regulating global
gene expression induced by the AR in primary prostate epithelial cells was previously unknown.
In early studies downregulation of cyclin D1 was shown to be
necessary for PCNA relocation and repair of DNA in response to
UV-induced DNA damage (21). In subsequent studies, cyclin D1

The cyclin D1 gene governs diverse functions implicated in
the onset and progression of tumorigenesis. As the regulatory
subunit of a holoenzyme formed through heterodimerization
with CDK4/CDK6, cyclin D1 governs G1–S phase progression
of cultured cells through phosphorylation of the pRb protein.
In addition, cyclin D1-dependent kinases phosphorylate NRF-1
to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis (1, 2). The expression of
cyclin D1 is induced by growth factors, oncogenes, and cellular
stress, and the abundance of cyclin D1 is rate-limiting in the
growth of a variety of human malignancies (3). Cyclin D1
overexpression promotes the growth of multiple tumor types.
Cyclin D1 antisense abrogated the growth of breast tumors

was shown to bind DNA damage repair (DDR) proteins including
BRCA1 (22). Using gH2AX as a marker of DNA damage and comet
assays to assess repair of damaged DNA, endogenous cyclin D1
was shown to enhance DDR (23). Cyclin D1/ MEFs showed
enhanced apoptosis in response to UV irradiation (24). In addition, cyclin D1 induces the expression of, and binds, Rad51 and
serves to recruit DNA repair factors to chromatin. The recruitment
of DNA repair factors was shown to be enhanced by cyclin D1, but
not the related cyclin D1b isoform (23). In contrast, breast cancer
cells overexpressing cyclin D1 showed enhanced apoptosis in
response to g-irradiation, suggesting cell-type–speciﬁc differences
in response to DNA damage (23, 25).
In order to determine the signiﬁcance of endogenous cyclin
D1 in androgen-induced DNA repair in vitro and in vivo, prostatic
cancer cells and ventral prostates from cyclin D1/ gene knockout animals were deployed. These studies identify a novel role
for cyclin D1 in the DNA damage response in normal and
malignant prostate epithelial cells. Microarray-based gene
expression analysis demonstrated that endogenous cyclin D1
is required for androgen-dependent gene expression. In LNCaP
cells, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment reduced the number
of gH2AX foci and was contingent upon cyclin D1 abundance
since shRNA to cyclin D1 ablated the DHT mediated reduction
in gH2AX foci. Using a direct measure of DNA repair, we
demonstrate DHT-induced DNA repair is cyclin D1 dependent.
Finally, tethering cyclin D1 to local chromatin was sufﬁcient to
induce the DDR in the presence of AR.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and DNA transfection
Cell lines were authenticated by examination of morphology
and growth proﬁle and were mycoplasma-free. LNCaP cells
(ATCC; Passage ¼ 26) were maintained in RPMI containing 1%
penicillin/streptomycin supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Life Technologies). NIH2/4 cells (a gift from Dr. T.
Misteli, NCI, Bethesda, MD) were cultured in DMEM containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin supplemented with 10% FBS.
The NIH2/4 (parental, NIH3T3) stable cell line has 256 repeats
of the lac operator sequence (lacO) stably integrated into
chromosome 3. The NIH2/4 stable cell line was transfected
using the Nucleofector kit for immortalized cell lines (Amaxa,
Nucleofector R). All cell lines were cultured for less than 6
months. Mouse primary prostate epithelial cells (PEC) were
prepared from the ventral prostate of FVB cyclin D1/ and FVB
cyclin D1þ/þ mice (26, 27). The ventral prostate was rinsed three
times in PBS containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin and gentamicin. The tissue was ﬁnely chopped in a 6-cm cell culture plate
with a sterile razor blade and suspended in 1.5 mL of collagenase
blend type L (0.5 mg/mL) and placed at 37 C in a 5% CO2
incubator for 16 hours. Cells were then transferred to a polypropylene tube and washed three times with 5 mL of PBS, centrifuging
at 2,000 rpm for ﬁve minutes between washes. Pellets were
resuspended in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS,
insulin 5 mg/mL, EGF 10 ng/mL, hydrocortisone 1 mg/mL, transferrin 5 ng/mL, bovine pituitary extract 30 mg/mL, 1% penicillin/
streptomycin, and 1% gentamicin (growth medium). Cells were
plated in 10-cm culture dishes and placed at 37 C in a 5% CO2
incubator for 4 hours, during this period ﬁbroblasts will attach
and supernatant containing epithelial cells withdrawn and plated
onto 10 cm poly-lysine coated dishes. Growth media was changed
every 48 hours.

Chemicals and reagents
Experimental procedures with transgenic mice were approved
by the ethics committee of Thomas Jefferson University
(Philadelphia, PA). Cyclin D1/ mice were in the FVB strain
(24). Murine prostate epithelial cells were isolated from prostate
glands and maintained as previously described and analyzed after
25 passages with at least three lines of each genotype (28). FACS
analysis for Ki-67 and BrdUrd-positive cells (29) was conducted, as
previously described (30). The DHT was used at physiologic
concentration of 10 nmol/L (Sigma).
siRNA transfection
The siRNA to cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and control
siRNA were transfected using oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells
were seeded at 60% density in 6-well plates, washed once in PBS
followed by transfection. Control siRNA or cyclin D1 siRNA
(80 nmol/L) was used to treat cells in phenol red free, serum
and antibiotic-free RPMI. Cells were arrested by starvation in 0.1%
FBS or 5% charcoal-stripped medium for 72 hours. Cells were
stimulated with either 10% serum or DHT at physiologic concentrations for 24 hours.
RNA extraction from prostate epithelial cell samples
RNA was extracted from epithelial cells using the RecoverAllTotal Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems) followed by
RQ1 DNase I (Promega Inc) mediated removal of contaminating
DNA from RNA preparations followed by RNA clean-up using
RNAEasy Kit (Qiagen Inc). RNA was labeled for hybridization
with affymetrix chip-420_2.0 as previously described (15).
Microarray analysis methods
We used quantile normalization of the chip intensities as our
preferred method of normalization (31). The limma package (32)
was utilized to perform the analysis of the microarray experiments
with P values for each gene measuring the degree of association
between gene expression and phenotype. We used the Bonferonni
correction, which would consider an association signiﬁcant if the
P value is less than /m, where m is the number of genes tested
and  is the nominal Type I error level. The false discovery rate,
which is the expected proportion of false positives (33), was also
used (data ﬁles submitted to GEO- GSE57867). Pathway analysis
of differentially regulated genes was conducted in DAVID using
the PANTHER database resource (34, 35).
Immunoﬂuorescence
NIH2/4-AR cells stably expressing AR were serum deprived
(0.05% serum) for 24 hours before transfection (Lipofectamine
2000) with Cherry-LacR-NLS-MCD1, Cherry-LacR-NLS-Cyclin
D1, or Cherry-LacR-NLS. Following 5 hours after transfection
media were changed to DMEM containing 10% charcoal/dextran–treated FBS serum plus and minus DHT (10 nmol/L) for 24
hours. Slides were ﬁxed with 10% formalin for 10 minutes at
room temperature. The slides were then treated with 0.2% Triton
X-100 for 5 minutes at room temperature and blocked with 2%
BSA overnight at 4 C. The primary antibodies used were mouse
monoclonal anti-phospho-Histone H2AX (Ser139; clone
JBW301; Millipore Corporation; 1/1,000) and AR (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; 1/200).
DNA repair assays

Hope, Duarte, CA; ref. 36). DR-GFP is used to quantify

homology-directed repair (HDR) in transient transfection of
LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells were cultured in DMEM containing
penicillin and streptomycin (100 mg of each/liter) and supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were infected with lentiviral
particles shRNA vector or shRNA cyclin D1 (pTRIPZ system).
Positive cells were selected using puromycin (2 mg/mL) for 2
weeks. Puromycin resistance clones were pooled. To analyze
the efﬁciency of HDR LNCaP (pTRIPZ shVector and shcyclin
D1) cells were cultured in phenol red-free DMEM with 10%
charcoal/dextran–treated FBS and 2 mmol/L glutamine and 1
mmol/L doxycycline for 24 hours. Then the cells were transiently cotransfected with DR-GFP and pCbA-Sce (provided by Dr.
Jeremy M. Stark) using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At
the same time, the cells were treated with DHT (10 nmol/L) or
vehicle (ethanol) control. Twenty-four and 48 hours after
transfection, the cells were changed with fresh DHT or vehicle
control. The cells were cultured for 3 days to allow completion
of repair, then the percentage of GFP-positive (GFPþ) cells were
analyzed by FACS analysis. The GFP expression plasmid in the
same backbone, pCAGGS-NZEGFP was used as a transfection
efﬁciency control. The empty vector pCAGGS-BSKX was used as
a negative control.

shRNA transduction and clonogenic assay
LNCaP cells were stable transduced with either pTRIPZ lentiviral-inducible vector shRNA control (shRNA-Ctrl) or shRNA
against CCND1 (shRNA-CCND1) and seeded 24 hours before
induction of shRNA. Expression of shRNA-Ctrl and shRNACCND1 was induced by treating cell with doxycycline (1 mg/mL)
for 72 hours and then seeded in cell culture ﬂasks (2.5  105). The
following day, cells were irradiated with 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, or 3
grays. After 14 days, colonies were stained with crystal violet
solution and counted. The clonogenic survival fraction was set
to the cell plating efﬁciency.
Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance between the numbers of gH2AX foci in
the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP stably transduced either with
shRNA-Ctrl or shRNA-CCND1 in the presence of DHT or vehicle

Cyclin D1 promotes DHT-dependent DNA synthesis and is
required for DHT-induced reduction of gH2AX foci in prostate
cancer cell lines
DHT induced cell proliferation of LNCaP cells compared with
vehicle control cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A), consistent with a
previous report (37). In order to examine the requirement for
cyclin D1 in prostate cancer cellular proliferation, LNCaP cells
were treated with either cyclin D1 siRNA or control siRNA. The
DNA synthetic phase was reduced 50% upon transduction with
cyclin D1 siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
In view of the ﬁnding that liganded AR promotes homologous
DNA Repair and that cyclin D1 inhibits AR activation through
binding the C-terminal region of AR in the C-terminus of cyclin
D1 (38), we determined the role for cyclin D1 in DHT signaling
and the DNA damage response in LNCaP cells. Histone H2AX
phosphorylation on Serine 139 producing gH2AX is a sensitive
marker for DNA double-strand breaks (39). Large foci of gH2AX
are important for the accumulation and retention of DSB repair
factors (40). We assessed the assemblage of nuclear repair foci
containing gH2AX in LNCaP cells transduced with either inducible cyclin D1 shRNA or control shRNA vector and treated with
DHT (10 nmol/L; Fig. 1A). gH2AX foci were reduced after 30
minutes of DHT treatment (P< 0.001; Fig. 1B). Cyclin D1 shRNA
abrogated the DHT-mediated reduction of gH2AX foci. Thus,
cyclin D1 is required for the androgen-dependent attenuation of
the DNA damage response (Fig. 1C).
In view of the ﬁnding that endogenous cyclin D1 reduces
gH2AX foci in vitro, we conducted IHC staining for evidence of
cyclin D1 reduction of DNA damage in the prostate gland in vivo.
As a well-established marker of the DNA damage response, we
conducted IHC staining for gH2AX assessing the ventral prostate
of cyclin D1/ versus cyclin D1þ/þ littermate controls after castration and DHT replacement (Fig. 2A and B). Basal level gH2AX
was increased in cyclin D1/ versus cyclin D1þ/þ mice (P< 0.05).
DHT reduced gH2AX in vivo (P< 0.01) but the effect of DHT on the
DDR was abrogated in the cyclin D1/ mice. Thus endogenous
cyclin D1 is required for DHT-mediated reduction of DNA damage in the prostate in vivo.

experimental conditions a two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test were performed. For the DNA repair rate in
LNCaP cells stable for either shRNA-Ctrl or shRNA-CCND1, the
surviving fraction was analyzed by a two-way ANOVA followed by
the Bonferroni post hoc test. All data are expressed as mean  SEM.

At 3 Grays cyclin D1 promoted clonogenic survival of LNCaP cells

In order to understand the role of cyclin D1 in prostate
epithelial cell-dependent gene expression, we deployed primary
murine prostate epithelial cell cultures that express wild-type AR.
We next conducted immunoﬂuorescence on the PECs from cyclin
D1/ and cyclin D1þ/þ cells with cytokeratin 8 (CK8) and
cytokeratin 5 (CK5). CK8 positive and CK5 negative are luminal
in origin, CK5/CK8 double positive are intermediate cells and
CK8 negative, and CK5 positive are basal cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2). The data demonstrate that the predominant cell lineage is
luminal in origin. The primary PECs from either wild-type or cyclin

(10 nm; Fig. 4A and B). Western blot analysis demonstrated a
complete absence of cyclin D1 in cyclin D1/ cells (Fig. 4C). In the
wild-type cells, the addition of DHT induced AR abundance;
however, the relative abundance of the AR was not induced by
DHT in cyclin D1/ cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
In order to determine whether cyclin D1 promoted DHT-dependent DNA repair through a transcriptional program a genome-wide
analysis of the genes regulated by endogenous cyclin D1 in primary
prostate epithelial cells was conducted. An analysis of the genes
regulated by DHT in cyclin D1þ/þ (883 genes) and cyclin D1/
PECs (24 genes) reveals that 93% of the genes regulated by DHT
are dependent upon cyclin D1 (Fig. 4D and E and Supplementary
Data Set S1). In cyclin D1þ/þ PECs, most of the genes (64%) were
downregulated in response to DHT. Using PANTHER functional
annotation identiﬁed the pathways regulated by DHT in cyclin
D1þ/þ cells (Fig. 4F). Many of the pathways inhibited by DHT in a
cyclin D1-dependent manner are associated with cell growth and
proliferation, cell cycle, development, signal transduction, and
growth factor signaling. We next asked whether there is any clinical
relevance of the cyclin D1-dependent gene signature. Signatures
were tested for prognostic value as described previously (41). We

Cyclin D1 inhibits DHT-dependent recruitment of repair
factors to chromatin
Previous studies had shown that stable association of DDR
factors with chromatin ampliﬁed the DDR signal via an ATM
and DNA-PK-mechanism (42). Cyclin D1 is tethered to chromatin in a similar manner (23). In order to examine the role of
DHT in the recruitment of DDR factors to chromatin, we used a
LacR system. The cDNAs encoding DNA repair factors or cyclin
D1 were fused to the Escherichia coli lac-repressor (LacR) and
tagged with Cherry-red ﬂuorescent protein. These expression
plasmids were examined in an NIH3T3 cell line that contains
256 repeats of the LacO stably integrated into chromosome 3
(NIH 2/4; Fig. 5A). The NIH 2/4 cells were transduced by
retrovirus encoding the AR to produce the androgen-responsive
cell line NIH 2/4-AR (Fig. 5B). Recruitment of this chimeric
protein Cherry-lacR-NLS-Cyclin D1 compared with CherryLacR-NLS control vector demonstrated that the total number
of gH2AX foci was reduced by expression of cyclin D1 (P <
0.001; Fig. 5C). Transfection with the positive control expression plasmid encoding the DNA repair factor fusion CherrylacR-NLS-MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1) was sufﬁcient to activate the DDR as demonstrated by
gH2AX-positive foci at the lacO site (Fig. 5D and E). Phosphorylation of H2AX at the LacO site was substantially
enhanced in the presence of cyclin D1 and DHT (P< 0.001;
Fig. 5D, F and G).

Discussion
The current studies demonstrate that DHT induced recruitment
of cyclin D1 to sites of DNA damage associated with a reduction in
the formation of gH2AX repair foci. The recruitment of the DNA
repair protein MDC1 was unaffected by DHT. Cyclin D1 reduced
the number of gH2AX repair foci both in primary prostate
epithelial cells in vivo and in transformed LNCaP cells. Consistent
with these ﬁndings, cyclin D1 promoted DNA repair mediated via
homology directed repair in a DHT-dependent manner. The
contemporaneous induction of DNA synthesis and cellular division with the induction of DNA repair by cyclin D1 may contribute to DNA damage therapy resistance in prostate cancer cells.
In human prostate cancer cells, the abundance of cyclin D1 is
induced by growth factors and siRNA to cyclin D1 reduced
ErbB2-mediated DNA synthesis in LNCaP cells (43). Cyclin D1
enhanced cellular proliferation in two studies (44, 45) and
inhibited proliferation in another study (46). Cyclin D1 physically associates with the AR in IP-Western blot analysis and
forced overexpression of cyclin D1 is capable of inhibiting AR
reporter gene activity (38). The difference between our results,
in which endogenous cyclin D1 enhanced cell proliferation and
DNA synthesis, contrasts with ﬁndings of cyclin D1 cDNA
overexpression in LNCaP cells (46). These differences therefore
may relate to the experimental approach in which we have
examined the role of endogenous cyclin D1 rather than assessing the effect of cyclin D1 overexpression.
In the current studies, DHT promoted the DNA damage signaling assessed by gH2AX foci in the prostate in vivo and in LNCaP
cells in tissue culture. Recently, Polkinghorn and colleagues (47)
demonstrated that AR signaling promoted expression of genes
that enhance DNA repair. Using gH2AX foci and a comet assay as a
marker of DNA damage androgen depletion decreased DNA
repair in LNCaP cells. The decreased DNA repair of irradiated

336 Cancer Res; 76(2) January 15, 2016

LNCaP cells treated with antiandrogens was associated with
reduced colony survival by clonogenic assay. Finally, in assays
to directly measure nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and
homologous repair, there was signiﬁcantly decreased NHEJ in the
antiandrogen-treated LNCaP cells; however, there was no change
in homologous repair. More recently, Goodwin and colleagues
(48) demonstrate that AR signaling promoted DNA repair in a
castrate resistance prostate cancer model (C4-2 cells). When C4-2
cells were challenged with DNA damage, AR was activated and AR
recruitment to genes that regulate DNA repair was promoted,
leading to repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. However, in
cyclin D1þ/þ PECs we did not observe changes in gene expression
by microarray analysis consistent with DHT induction of DNA
repair. We note that most of the genes in the PEC microarray of
DHT-dependent gene expression changes are cyclin D1 dependent. This observation in PECs is similar to the 17b-estradiol–
stimulated cyclin D1-dependent gene expression changes in the
mouse mammary gland (49). Genome-wide expression proﬁling
conducted of 17b-estradiol-treated castrated virgin mice deleted
of the ccnd1 gene demonstrated that cyclin D1 determines estrogen-dependent gene expression for 88% of estrogen-responsive
genes in vivo. In the case of PECs, we observed that 97% of the
genes are dependent on cyclin D1 (Supplementary Table S1).
Over the last two decades, a substantial body of evidence has
suggested that cyclin D1 plays a direct role in transcriptional
regulation. Cyclin D1 physically associates with, and regulates the
transcriptional activity of more than 30 transcription factors,
including neuroD, myoD, CEBPb, PPARg, and estrogen receptor.
Previous studies examined transcriptional regulation of the cyclin
D1 target genes, LPL, aP2 (18), and miR17/20 (50). ChIP-ChIP
demonstrated cyclin D1 and p300 together occupied genes in
close proximity to the transcriptional start site, and wholegenome ChIP-Seq demonstrated enrichment of cyclin D1 at genes
that regulate mitosis and chromosomal instability in close proximity to the transcriptional start site (19, 51). Together, these
studies are consistent with a model in which cyclin D1 functions
to regulate transcription in a cdk-independent manner.
DNA damage induces a step-wise change in chromatin structure, which participates in maintaining genomic integrity (52)
and chromatin topology impacts the genotoxic stress responses.
Hyper-condensed chromatin is associated with lower efﬁciency of
DNA repair and more compact chromatin leads to DNA-damage
resistance (53). In the current studies, endogenous cyclin D1
enhanced DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Cyclin D1
reduced the number of DNA lesion assessed by gH2AX repair
foci in vitro and in vivo in a DHT-dependent fashion. Cyclin D1 is
recruited to sites of DNA damage in a DHT-dependent manner.
These ﬁndings are consistent with a role for cyclin D1 in promoting DNA repair.
