ABSTRACT
Background: Treating drug-resistant sarcomas remains a major challenge. The
present study aimed to identify a novel therapy for drug-resistant sarcomas based
on metabolic errors involving argininosuccinate synthetase1 (ASS1).
Results: ASS1 expression was reduced in Dox-resistant sarcoma cells.
Immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR showed an inverse correlation between
ASS1 and P-gp expressions. The inhibition of cellular proliferation with G1-arrest was
shown to lead to autophagy with arginine deprivation. In addition, the combination
of an autophagy inhibitor plus arginine deprivation was more effective than arginine
deprivation alone. In cells with suppressed ASS1 expression, P-gp expression was
upregulated as compared to that in negative controls.
Discussion: These results indicate that the reduced ASS1 expression in Doxresistant sarcomas may contribute to drug resistance in association with the
expression of P-gp. ASS1 deficiency is a potential target for novel drug therapies.
The combination of arginine-deprivation therapy and an autophagy inhibitor may
have anti-tumor effects in refractory sarcomas.
Methods: We assessed the expressions of ASS1 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in
clinical specimens and cell lines of osteosarcoma (KHOS), doxorubicin (Dox)-resistant
osteosarcoma (KHOSR2), epithelioid sarcomas (ES-X and VAESBJ) and alveolar soft part
sarcoma (ASPS-KY). Each cell line was cultured in arginine-containing and argininefree media. Cell growth was assessed using an XTT assay and flow cytometry. We
analyzed the induction of autophagy in arginine-free medium. Moreover, we assessed
the expression of P-gp after suppressing ASS1 in Dox-sensitive cells (MCF-7 and
KHOS) and after transfecting ASS1 into Dox-resistant cells (ES-X, VAESBJ, ASPS-KY
and KHOSR2).

sarcomas initially have or develop resistance to currently
available chemotherapeutic agents and this remains
a major clinical challenge. In particular, alveolar soft
part sarcoma (ASPS) and epithelioid sarcoma (ES) are
characterized by being soft-tissue sarcomas unresponsive
to the antitumor drug regimens presently used in
clinical settings. ASPS, which was initially described by

INTRODUCTION
The prognosis of patients with sarcomas has
improved since the introduction of chemotherapy in the
1980s [1]. Doxorubicin (Dox) is one of the key agents
currently used to control advanced bone and soft-tissue
sarcomas [2, 3]. However, some bone and soft-tissue

Christopherson in 1952, is a very rare soft-tissue sarcoma
of unknown histogenesis that most commonly occurs in
adolescents and young adults [4]. In previous reports,
ASPS was noted to be a soft-tissue sarcoma in which
cytotoxic chemotherapy had little effect [5]. Although
complete excision of the primary tumor is the only
curative treatment option [6, 7], most patients already
have metastatic dissemination (especially to the lungs
and brain) at the time of diagnosis. In such inoperable
cases, the outcomes are very poor [8]. ES, which was first
proposed by Enzinger in 1970 [9], tends to develop in the
hands and fingers of young adults [10]. It predominantly
affects the subcutaneous tissues, fasciae or the tendon
sheaths of the hands and forearms [9, 11]. The prognosis
of ES patients is reported to be relatively poor because
ES is characteristically resistant to chemotherapy [7, 8,
11], metastasizes to the regional lymph nodes and has a
local recurrence rate of 65% or higher [10]. In contrast,
osteosarcoma (OS) is the most frequent primary malignant
bone tumor in children and young adults. The introduction
of preoperative combined chemotherapy in the last three
decades has significantly improved the survival rate of
OS patients to approximately 70% [12]. However, the
outcomes of OS patients who show a poor response to
chemotherapy remain unfavorable due to their high risk
of developing distant metastasis. Thus, the identification
of a potential target that would allow the development
of novel therapeutic options remains an urgent issue in
efforts to improve the outcomes of patients with drugresistant sarcomas.
Metabolic dysregulation is often critical to the
growth and progression of cancer [13]. Recently,
argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) has attracted
interest as a potential therapeutic target based on the
advantages of using arginine auxotrophy. ASS1 is one of
the metabolic enzymes required for the biosynthesis of
arginine, a semi-essential amino acid, through the urea
cycle. Reduced ASS1 expression is frequently detected in
various human cancers including sarcomas [14–23].
In the present study, we investigated whether
reduced ASS1 expression is a potential therapeutic target
in refractory sarcomas and the relevance of the association
between ASS1 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expressions.

and KHOS to be Dox-sensitive cells. In contrast, VAESBJ,
ES-X, ASPS-KY, and KHOSR2 were found to be Doxresistant cells.

Expressions of P-gp and ASS1 in Dox-resistant
sarcoma cells
P-gp plays an important role in drug transport
and is related to chemotherapy resistance in various
malignancies. Thus, we confirmed P-gp expression levels
using the real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
method. In comparison to Dox-sensitive cells (MCF-7
and KHOS), P-gp mRNA expression was upregulated in
all Dox-resistant cells (VAESBJ, ES-X, ASPS-KY and
KHOSR2 cells) (Figure 1A). It is noteworthy that KHOSR2
cells showed the highest expression of P-gp.
The expression of ASS1 was also confirmed in each
cell line by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (Figure
1B). The ASS1 mRNA expression levels were reduced
in Dox-resistant as compared to Dox-sensitive cells.
Similarly, ASS1 protein expression was shown to be
upregulated by Western blotting (Figure 1C).
To assess the clinical relevance of the association
between ASS1 and P-gp expressions, we confirmed these
expressions immunohistochemically in an independent
cohort from patients with ASPS, ES and OS (Figure 1D,
Table 2). Of the 15 OS patients, 5 patients showed good
and 10 poor responses to chemotherapy. While ASS1
expression was negative in all ASPS and ES samples
(Figure 1Da and Figure 1Dc), P-gp expression was positive
in all samples (Figure 1Db and Figure 1Dd). As to the OS
patients, ASS1 expression was positive in 80% (4/5) of
good responders (Figure 1De) and in 10% (1/10) of poor
responders. P-gp expression was positive in 40% (2/5) of
good responders and in 90% (9/10) of poor responders
(Figure 1Dh). In summary, Dox-resistant sarcomas
showed higher P-gp and lower ASS1 expression than Doxsensitive cells.

Cell growth inhibition caused by arginine
deprivation in Dox-resistant sarcomas
XTT assays were conducted to observe cell growth
in arginine-containing and arginine-free media. No
obvious changes were detected in response to arginine
deprivation in either MCF-7 or KHOS cells. In contrast,
the Dox-resistant cells in which the expression of ASS1
was relatively reduced showed cell growth inhibition in
response to arginine deprivation (Figure 2A).
To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the cell
growth inhibition associated with arginine deprivation, a
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was
carried out. The FACS analysis revealed the MCF-7 and
KHOS cells that cultured in arginine-containing medium
to not differ significantly from those cultured in argininefree medium. An increase in the proportion of cells in

Cytotoxic effects of Dox on sarcoma cells
To evaluate the cytotoxicity of Dox, XTT assays
were performed for MCF-7 and sarcoma cells. The 50%
inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for colony formation
are shown in Table 1. The IC50 values for MCF-7 and
KHOS cells were 0.09μM and 0.22μM, respectively. The
IC50 values for the KHOSR2, VAESBJ, ES-X, and ASPSKY cells were approximately 0.98μM, 13.03μM, 5.52μM
and 10.91μM, respectively. These results revealed MCF-7

Chloroquine (CQ) inhibits autophagy and
augments the cell death induced by arginine
deprivation

the G1 phase and a decrease in the proportion of those in
the G2-M phase were observed in the Dox-resistant cells
when cultured in arginine-free medium. These results
indicate arginine deprivation to induce G1 arrest in Doxresistant sarcoma cells with low levels of ASS1 expression
(Figure 2B).

XTT assays were conducted to determine whether
the growth of Dox-resistant cells was promoted by
arginine-free medium, arginine-containing medium with
CQ (10μM) or arginine-free medium with CQ. The cells
grown in arginine-containing and arginine-free media with
CQ were compared, and cell growth inhibition was found
to be far more marked in those grown in arginine-free
medium with CQ (Figure 4).

Arginine deprivation caused autophagy in Doxresistant sarcoma cells
The levels of p62 and LC3-I/II expression
were investigated by Western blotting to examine the
relationship between autophagy and arginine deprivation.
In Dox-resistant sarcoma cells, the autophagic changes
were detectable based on the time-dependent degradation
of p62 and the conversion of cytosolic LC3-I/II to the
lipidated form (Figure 3). Given these observations, we
can reasonably speculate that arginine deprivation caused
the autophagic change in Dox-resistant sarcoma cells.

compared to that in controls (Figure 5A, 5B). In Doxresistant sarcoma cells in which P-gp expression had been
suppressed, however, ASS1 mRNA expression did not
change (Supplementary Figure S1A-S1D). Dox-resistant
cells which had been transfected with ASS1 showed no
change in P-gp mRNA expression. (Supplementary Figure
S1E-S1H).

To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies
examined whether or not ES and ASPS are resistant to
chemotherapy in vitro. We confirmed these cells to be
Dox-resistant in vitro, based on the IC50 of Dox being
significantly higher in these cells than in Dox-sensitive
cells (MCF-7 and KHOS) (Table 1).
Drug resistance in cancer is frequently associated
with P-gp overexpression. P-gp is the gene product of
the MDR protein 1 genes (MDR1, ABCB1) and a drug
efflux pump that prevents the intracellular accumulation
of anthracycline drugs [28, 29]. P-gp overexpression is
associated with poor outcomes in patients with OS and
soft-tissue sarcomas [30, 31]. Thus, P-gp expression
was examined in each of these cells. P-gp expression
was elevated in Dox-resistant cells as compared to Doxsensitive cells (Figure 1A).
ASS1 is one of the metabolic enzymes required
for the biosynthesis of arginine through the urea cycle.

DISCUSSION
Dox is a key drug for treating OS and soft-tissue
sarcomas and belongs to the family of anthracycline
antitumor agents [24–26]. However, in the clinical setting,
we often encounter patients whose sarcomas have become
Dox-resistant due to the development of multidrug
resistance (MDR). Therefore, the development of MDR
remains a major challenge in managing patients with OS
and soft-tissue sarcomas including ASPS and ES [27].

Arginine is widely recognized as a semi-essential amino
acid that can be taken up extracellularly when cells cannot
produce arginine autonomously [32, 33]. ASS1-deficient
cancers rely on extracellular arginine, due to arginine
auxotrophy [34]. Arginine deiminase (ADI) was developed
from a mycoplasma-derived enzyme as a novel anticancer
enzyme to induce arginine deprivation [35]. Pegylated
arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) is pegylated to reduce its
immunogenicity and cause tumor cell death by selectively
inducing arginine deprivation. Based on the advantages of
using arginine auxotrophy in tumors, arginine deprivation
has been investigated as a novel therapeutic strategy
aimed at disrupting cancer metabolism [14–16, 20, 21,
36–40]. With regard to sarcomas, in OS, reduced ASS1
expression is not only a novel predictive biomarker for the
development of metastasis, but also a potential target for
pharmacologic intervention [22]. ASS1 deficiency due to
promoter methylation is associated with poor outcomes of
patients with myxofibrosarcoma and ADI-PEG20 has been
suggested as a possible therapeutic target [23]. However,
the expression and roles of ASS1 in Dox-resistant
sarcomas have not yet been investigated. In the present
study, we confirmed ASS1 expression to be reduced in all

Dox-resistant sarcoma cells (Figure 1B, 1C). Furthermore,
we also demonstrated the association between ASS1 and
P-gp expressions in clinical samples of ASPS, ES and
OS (Figure 1D). In all ASPS, ES and chemo-resistant OS
samples, ASS1 expression was essentially negative, but
P-gp expression was positive except 1 chemo-resistant
OS sample (Table 2). Interestingly, our results suggest an
inverse correlation between the expressions of ASS1 and
P-gp in both cell lines and clinical samples. Because ASS1
expression was reduced in Dox-resistant sarcoma cells, we
conducted cell proliferation assays for each of the cells
examined under arginine-deprivation conditions. Doxresistant sarcoma cells in arginine-free medium showed
inhibited cell growth with G1 arrest, while the growth
was unaffected in arginine-containing medium (Figure 2,
Table 3). These findings raise the possibility that arginine
deprivation may be a new therapeutic target in patients
with Dox-resistant sarcomas.
Generalized amino-acid deprivation has been
suggested to induce autophagy [41]. Similarly, arginine
deprivation promoted autophagy as a means of survival
in ASS1-deficient cancers [42, 43]. Autophagy, which
involves the self-digestion of cells that are subjected to

stress and starvation, is an important cellular catabolic
process for survival [44, 45]. In this study, arginine
deprivation appeared to induce autophagy in Doxresistant cells (Figure 3). Therefore, we hypothesized
that autophagy inhibition in response to arginine
deprivation might serve as the basis for developing
novel therapies for Dox resistant sarcomas. CQ, which
is used for the treatment of malaria, is known to be an
autophagy inhibitor that blocks the fusion of lysosomes
[15, 46]. We conducted cell proliferation assays in
Dox-resistant cells by combining CQ with arginine
deprivation. This combination was found to inhibit cell
growth more effectively than arginine deprivation alone
(Figure 4). These findings raise the possibility of using
this combination as a novel therapy for Dox-resistant
sarcomas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report to describe autophagy induction, in sarcoma cells,
in response to arginine deprivation.
Although the reason for reduced ASS1 expression
in certain types of cancer that generally have a poor
prognosis remains to be elucidated, reduced ASS1
expression has been noted to be associated with resistance
to chemotherapy. In pancreatic cancer, reduced ASS1
expression predicts unfavorable tumor behaviors such as
lymph node metastasis, local invasion and resistance to
gemcitabine-based chemotherapy [17]. In ovarian cancer,
the loss of ASS1 expression specifically confers resistance
to platinum-based chemotherapy [47]. We hypothesized
that ASS1 expression in Dox-resistant sarcoma might be
associated with resistance to chemotherapy because the
level of P-gp expression showed an inverse correlation
with that of ASS1. In this study, P-gp expression was
significantly enhanced by suppressing that of ASS1 in
Dox-sensitive cells (Figure 5A, 5B). However, ASS1
expression was not enhanced by suppressing that of P-gp
in Dox-resistant cells (Supplementary Figure S1A-S1D).
In cells transfected with ASS1, P-gp expression was not
reduced (Supplementary Figure S1E-S1H). The inverse
correlation between ASS1 and P-gp expressions in both
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell lines (Figure 1A–1C, Figure 5A–5B) and clinical
samples (Figure 1D) raise the possibility that ASS1
expression contributes to chemotherapy resistance in
association with the expression of P-gp in Dox-resistant
cells, although the correlation between ASS1 and P-gp
expressions may not be direct.
The present study has limitations. First, we cannot
conclude that our in vitro results are applicable to in vivo
settings (animal experiments). Furthermore, the drug
resistance associated with P-gp expression may be only
one of several factors contributing to drug resistance.
Thus, we need to design future studies to identify other
factors possibly contributing to the development of drug
resistance.
In conclusion, we demonstrated ASS1 expression to
be reduced in Dox-resistant sarcoma cells. We hypothesize
that this reduction contributes to the development of
drug resistance, which is known to be related to P-gp
expression. Our results also suggest that the reduced
ASS1 expression might serve as a target for novel
pharmacological interventions, even in patients with
Dox-resistant sarcomas. As the induction of autophagy
in response to arginine deprivation may have a prosurvival role in patients with ASS1-deficient sarcomas,
the combination of arginine deprivation therapy with
autophagy modulators might potentiate anti-tumor effects
in patients with drug-resistant sarcomas. We anticipate that
validation of these results will lead to clinical applications
in the treatment of refractory bone and soft-tissue
sarcomas.

(Massachusetts General Hospital, MA, US). The breast
cancer cells (MCF-7) were obtained from Exploratory
Oncology Research, National Cancer Center Hospital
(Tokyo, Japan).
The VAESBJ and ASPS-KY cells were cultured
in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, US). The ES-X
cells were cultured in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's
Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The MCF-7,
KHOS and KHOSR2 cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All of the cells were
incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). In addition, the VAESBJ cells were
cultured with Non-Essential Amino Acids (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Arginine-free medium was used as a
substitute for arginine deprivation therapy in the present
study. Arginine-free medium was prepared by the Cell
Science & Technology Institute (Miyagi, Japan) and was
supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum
(Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Dox was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Chloroquine (CQ) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (MO, USA). To analyze the
cytotoxicity of Dox and CQ, MCF-7, VAESBJ, ES-X and
KHOS cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density
of 3,000 cells per well and then incubated for 24 h. The
ASPS-KY and KHOSR2 cells were seeded into 96-well
plates at a density of 4,000 cells per well. Incubation was
continued for 72 h after Dox treatment, at which point 100
μl of the medium were replaced with fresh medium.

Cellular proliferation was examined employing
an XTT-based colorimetric assay according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, each of the cells was
cultured in 96-well plates. After incubation periods
of 1, 4 and 7 days, a Cell Proliferation Kit XTT based
Colorimetric Assay (Biological Industries, Kibbutz BeitHaemek, Israel) was added to each well and incubation
was continued for 6 hours at 37°C. Optical density was
measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a 96-multiwell
microplate reader (TECAN, Mannedorf, Switzerland).

Real time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using a Pure Link RNA
Mini kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the synthesis
of cDNA, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed
using a Super Script VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The primers and TaqMan probes for
18S rRNA, ASS1 and P-gp were obtained from Applied
Biosystems (TaqMan Gene Expression Assays). The
amplification data, measured as increases in reporter
fluorescence, were collected using a 7500 Fast Real-Time
PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The mRNA expression
level relative to the internal control (18S rRNA gene) was
calculated using the comparative threshold cycle method.

Western blotting
The cells were cultured in a 75 cm2 flask until they
reached approximately 80% confluence. Total cellular
protein was extracted by scraping the cells into M-PER™
Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). The cellular proteins were centrifuged at
15000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C, and then placed on ice
for 30 minutes. The protein concentration was measured
using a BSA protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). Tenmicrogram portions of the protein samples were separated
by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto the membranes. After
blocking at room temperature for 1 h with skim milk,
incubation with primary antibodies against β-actin (1:1000
dilution Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), SQSTM1 / p62
(1:500 dilution, Abcam), ASS1 (1:500 dilution, Abnova,
Neihu District, Taipei), and LC3-I/II (1:1000 dilution,
Abcam) and the relevant secondary antibodies (AntiMouse IgG antibody and Anti-Rabbit IgG antibody) (GE
Healthcare Japan, Tokyo, Japan), was continued at room
temperature for 1 h. Blots were detected using enhanced
chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents
(Bio-Rad).

Patients and tumor samples
With institutional review board (IRB) approval (IRB
No.2004-050), all samples were obtained by biopsy from
the primary tumor sites of 2, 3 and 15 patients with ASPS,
ES and OS, respectively, at the National Cancer Center
Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) between 2011 and 2016. With
regard to OS, the response to chemotherapy was classified
as good if the extent of tumor necrosis was at least 90%.

Immunohistochemical analysis
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of
ASPS, ES and OS were deparaffinized and dehydrated.
The sections were then subjected to antigen retrieval in
an autoclave. The sections were incubated with mouse
monoclonal antibody against ASS1 (Abnova, Neihu
District, Taipei) at a 1:200 dilution and P-Glycoprotein /
MDR-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hudson, NH, USA) at
a 1:1000 dilution. Staining was visualized using the DAB
detection system (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA).

each well of a 96-well plate (Coaster, Cambridge, MA,
USA). The following day, the cell monolayer was washed
with pre-warmed sterile phosphate-buffered saline. The
cells were transfected with the appropriate siRNA using
Lipofectamine transfection reagents (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol.
Twenty-four hours later, the culture medium of the
transfected cells was replenished. Total protein and RNA
were extracted at 72 hours after transfection.
