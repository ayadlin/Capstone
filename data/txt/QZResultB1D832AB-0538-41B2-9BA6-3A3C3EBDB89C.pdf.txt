ABSTRACT
Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, but aggressive endocrine malignancy
with a generally poor clinical outcome. There is no effective therapy for advanced
and metastatic ACC. In our study, we found that an existing drug (rottlerin) exerted
its tumour-suppressive function in ACC. Specifically, rottlerin inhibited cellular
proliferation of ACC cell lines (NCI-H295R and SW-13) in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. We also found that rottlerin induced cell apoptosis and promoted G0/G1
cell cycle arrest in ACC cell lines. The cellular migration and invasion of ACC cell lines
were decreased after treatment with rottlerin. Further, the molecular expression of
lipoprotein receptor related protein 6 (LRP6) and β-catenin were down-regulated in
rottlerin-treated ACC cells, which indicated that Wnt/β-catenin signaling was involved
in the tumour-suppressive function of rottlerin. To further confirm the anti-tumour
function of rottlerin, a nude mouse ACC xenograft model was used. The xenograft
growth curves and TUNEL assays demonstrated that rottlerin inhibited proliferation
and induced apoptosis in the ACC xenograft model. Furthermore, we verified that
rottlerin down-regulated the expression of LRP6 and β-catenin in vivo. The ACC cell
line and xenograft mouse model data indicated that rottlerin significantly inhibited
proliferation and induced apoptosis of ACC cells, likely via suppression of the Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway. Our study indicated the potential therapeutic utility of
rottlerin as a novel and potential chemotherapeutic agent for ACC.

INTRODUCTION

ACC. The combination of a cytotoxic drug and mitotane is
recommended as first-line therapy in advanced ACCs, but
the poor therapeutic efficiency (< 40%) and severe side
effects limits clinical utility [4]. Therefore, new agents for
ACC treatment are urgently required.
Rottlerin(1-[6-[(3-acetyl-2,4,6-trihydroxy-5methylphenyl)methyl]-5,7-dihydroxy-2,2dimethyl-2H1-benzopyran-8yl]3-phenyl-2-Propen-1-one),also known
as mallotoxin, is a natural plant polyphenol.Rottlerin
is a traditional Indian medicine previously used as an
antagonist of fertilization and treatment for cestode and
trematode infections [5]. In recent years, rottlerin has
been shown to regulate several cell processes, including
cell circle regulation, cellular proliferation, apoptosis,

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, but
typically aggressive malignancy with an estimated
annual incidence of 0.7–2.0 cases per million population.
ACCs are highly aggressive with a poor prognosis and
an overall survival rate at 5 years of only 25%–50% in
most series [1, 2]. Until recently, radical surgical resection
has been the only potentially curative option for ACC;
however, approximately 40% of patients initially present
with distant metastases. Even after seemingly complete
removal of the tumor, recurrences occur in approximately
60%–80% of ACC patients [3]. Unfortunately, there is no
effective therapy for patients with advanced or recurrent

autophagy, and migration [6]. Numerous studies have
demonstrated that rottlerin plays an important role in antitumor activity in several cancers like prostate cancers
and pancreatic cancer,and has great potential as a novel
chemotherapeutic agent. Other studies have shown that
rottlerin suppresses tumor cell survival in breast cancer,
likely via suppression of the Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway
[7]. Within the adrenal cortex, the Wnt/β-catenin cascade
is involved in adrenal development and differentiation [8].
Indeed, abnormal functioning of the Wnt/β-catenin signal
pathway may lead to adrenal tumourigenesis [9, 10]. In
patients with ACC, β-catenin activation is associated with
decreased overall survival. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway
is expected to be an efficient targeting strategy for the
treatment of ACC [11, 12]. Therefore, we sought to
investigate the potential role and preliminary mechanisms
of rottlerin in tumor cell proliferation, migration, and
invasion in ACC cell lines and an ACC xenograft
mouse model. In addition, we explored the potential
therapeutic utility of rottlerin as a novel and potential
chemotherapeutic agent for ACC.

the rottlerin-treated group compared with the control and
DMSO groups. After treatment with 2.5 μM rottlerin for
48 h, the percentage of apoptotic cells reached 13.0% in
the NCI-H295R cells and 10.9% in the SW-13 cells. After
treatment with 5 μM rottlerin for 48 h, the percentage of
apoptotic cells reached 43.3% in the NCI-H295R cells and
38.3% in the SW-13 cells. The results suggest that rottlerin
induces apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The results
of AO/EB staining support these conclusions regarding
morphology changes. The apoptosis rate increased in
the rottlerin-treated group compared with the control
and DMSO groups with AO/EB staining (Figure 2B,
*p < 0.05). The apoptosis rate in the 5μM rottlerin-treated
group was higher compared to the 2.5μM rottlerin-treated
group (Figure 2B, *p < 0.05).

Rottlerin caused cell cycle arrest of ACC cells
in vitro
Rottlerin inhibited cellular proliferation and may
also be involved with cell cycle arrest. Therefore, we
investigated the effect of rottlerin on the cell cycle of ACC
cells using flow cytometry analyses. After treatment with
5 μM rottlerin for 48 h, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest occurred
in ACC cells (Figure 1C). The percentage of cells in the
G1 phase was 85.14% in NCI-H295R cells and 81.88% in
SW-13 cells, which was significantly increased compared
with the control group (Figure 1D, *p < 0.05).

RESULTS
Rottlerin inhibits ACC cell proliferation in vitro
To investigate the effects of rottlerin on ACC, we
first evaluated whether or not rottlerin decreases viability
in ACC cell lines. NCI-H295R and SW-13 cells were
treated with rottlerin at the indicated concentration for 24,
48, 72, 96, and 120 h. It was shown that rottlerin inhibited
proliferation of ACC cells in a time- and dose-dependent
manner (Figure 1A). At a concentration of 4 μM, rottlerin
inhibited approximately 44.0% and 43.2% of NCI-H295R
and SW-13 cells, respectively, after treatment for 48 h.
In contrast, when exposed to 8μM rottlerin for 72 h, the
inhibition ratio (1-viable cell%) was up to 70% in SW13 cells and 80% in NCI-H295R cells. The 5-day growth
curves showed that the growth of rottlerin-treated cells
was relatively slower than cells not treated with rottlerin in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1B). The 48-h IC50 was
5.02 μM in NCI-H295R cells and 4.87 μM in SW-13 cells.

Rottlerin inhibited cell invasion and migration of
ACC cells
Invasion and migration are related to the malignant
features of ACCs [13]. To determine if rottlerin inhibits
cell invasion and migration of ACC cells, we performed
transwell invasion and migration assays. In the rottlerin
treatment group, the invasion of ACC cells was impaired
by rottlerin (5 μM); significantly fewer cells migrated to
the lower side of the transwell chamber membrane than
the control group (Figure 2C, *p < 0.05).
The results of wound healing assay demonstrated that
the migration rate of SW-13 cells was significantly reduced
by rottlerin (5 μM) compared with the control group
(Figure 3A). The 24 h migration rate was significantly
decreased in SW-13 cells (Figure 3C, *p < 0.05).

Rottlerin induced ACC cell apoptosis in vitro
To further elucidate the mechanism by which
rottlerin inhibits cellular growth in ACC cells, we
determined whether or not rottlerin induces apoptosis in
ACC cells. Flow cytometry was performed to show the
apoptosis rate of ACC cells after treatment with rottlerin
at the indicated concentration (5 μM [approximately the
48 h IC50] and 2.5 μM [approximately half of the 48 h
IC50]). The percentage of apoptosis (early apoptosis plus
late apoptosis) was identified in NCI-H295R and SW13 cells after rottlerin treatment (Figure 2A). The results
showed an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in

Rottlerin inhibited tumor growth in vivo
To investigate the effect of rottlerin on anti-tumor
activities in vivo, we established a SW-13 xenograft tumor
model in nude mice. With the administration of rottlerin
for 4 weeks, tumor sizes and body weight were measured
every 4 days. Assessment of tumor volume showed that the
rottlerin-treated groups had delayed tumor growth compared
to the control group and the group treated with DSMO
(Figure 4A). There was no significant weight differences

the control and DMSO-treated groups in vivo (Figure 5,
*p < 0.05). Moreover, in the higher dose-treated group
(rottlerin 4 mg/kg), the expression of β-catenin, LRP6,
and p-LRP was lower than the lower dose-treated group
(rottlerin 2 mg/kg).

among the groups and there was no toxicity or side effects
in the mice after 4 weeks of treatment (Figure 4B). Then,
mice were sacrificed and the xenografts were extirpated. As
shown in Figure 5, tumors were smaller in the experimental
groups than the control and DSMO groups, and tumors
were smaller in the rottlerin 4 mg/kg group than the rottlerin
2 mg/kg group. The mean volume of the tumors decreased
from 3.23 cm3 (control) and 3.35 cm3 (DMSO) to 1.56 cm3
(rottlerin 4 mg/kg) and 1.94 cm3 (rottlerin 2 mg/kg); the
difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). TUNEL
assays were performed to assess the anti-tumor activity of
rottlerin in vivo (Figure 4C). The TUNEL assays indicated
that the rottlerin-treated groups had higher apoptotic rates
compared with the control and DMSO-treated groups.

DISCUSSION
There is no effective treatment for patients with
locally advanced and metastatic ACC. Development of
effective treatment or novel agents for patients with locally
advanced and metastatic ACC is significant [14]. Rottlerin,
which is extracted from Mallotus philippinensis, is a
polyphenol that has been used as an ant-helminthic or a
fertilization antagonist. Rottlerin has been used in humans
for many years, has a good safety profile, and exhibits
little toxicity, even after long-term exposure [5]. Recently,
rottlerin has been shown to exhibit anti-neoplastic activity
in several cancers, including breast, prostate, colorectal,
and pancreatic cancers [7, 15, 16] by inhibiting various
cellular pathways known to play important roles in
carcinogenesis,like Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and
mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
signaling.however, its antineoplastic activity in ACC has
rarely been studied.
Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays an important role in
embryonic development and can lead to tumor formation
when aberrantly activated [14, 17]. The Wnt pathway
has been examined in relation to many cancers, such as
leukemia, melanoma, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer

Rottlerin suppressed the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
pathway
To determine if rottlerin suppresses the Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway in ACC, and to elucidate
the mechanism by which rottlerin mediates ACC cell
apoptosis, some signaling molecules in the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway were examined. Based on result of Western
blotting, We can conclude that rottlerin reduced the
expression of β-catenin, LRP6, and p-LRP in ACC cells
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3B).
Furthermore, we performed H&E (Figure 4D) and
immunohistochemistry staining in xenograft tissues, and
the results showed that rottlerin also down-regulated the
expression of β-catenin, LRP6, and p-LRP compared with

Figure 1: (A) Rottlerin both inhibited proliferation of ACC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. (B) Growth curve of NCI-H295R

[18]. Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway occurs in
ACC and is frequently caused by activating mutations of
the gene encoding Wnt/β-catenin [18]. Therefore, blocking
the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is expected to be an efficient
targeting strategy for the treatment of ACCs [4]. Recent
studies have reported that rottlerin blocks the Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway in some cancers, including
colorectal, prostate, and breast cancers [7].
In this study, we examined the effect of rottlerin
on ACC cells. The results showed that rottlerin inhibited
proliferation, induced apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle
arrest, and decreased invasion and mobility of ACC cell
lines. Furthermore, the results of animal experiments
showed that rottlerin inhibited tumor growth in vivo, and
there was no obvious toxic effect in nude mice. The results
showed that rottlerin has anti-neoplastic activity in ACC,
and could serve as a novel agent for the treatment of ACC.
We then turned to study the mechanism underlying
the antineoplastic activity of rotterlin against ACC. We
detected the expression of several key components of
the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in ACC cell lines
and xenografts of nude mice treated with rottlerin. Based
on Western blot and immunohistochemistry staining, the

expression of β-catenin, LRP6, and p-LRP6 was downregulated after treatment with rottlerin. We deduced that
rottlerin plays a role as an anti-tumor agent in ACC related
to Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway,likely via suppression
of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
β-catenin, which is encoded by the CTNNB1
gene, is a key component of this signaling pathway
and has multiple functions, including mediation of cell
adhesion and signal transduction [19, 20]. β-catenin
combines with a variety of proteins to regulate cell
proliferation and differentiation, which is critical for
embryonic development and tumorigenesis [21]. In ACC,
accumulation of β-catenin has frequently been noted,
indicating activation of the Wnt signaling pathway.
Mutations in β-catenin have been associated with a poor
prognosis in patients with ACC, and higher-grade ACC is
associated with higher β-catenin expression [22]. In our
study,β-catenin was down-regulated by rottlerin in ACC
cells, both in vitro and in vivo.
LRP6, an indispensable co-receptor for the Wnt
signaling pathway, is a member of the low-density
lipoprotein receptor family, which interacts with the
seven transmembrane receptor of the Frizzled (Fzd)

for 48h was higher compared with the lower concentration groups (*p < 0.05). (C) The transwell invasion and migration assay showed that

family to activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
[23]. LRP6 is expressed in human cancer cell lines and
up-regulated in human malignant tissues [24], and LRP6
silencing weakens Wnt/β-catenin signaling and inhibits
cell proliferation and tumor growth in breast and prostate
cancers [25]. LRP6 is readily expressed in ACC cells
[26], but there has been limited research involving LRP6
in ACC. In our study, LRP6 and its phosphorylated form
(p-LRP6) were down-regulated by rottlerin in ACC cells,
both in vitro and in vivo.
Blocking the Wnt signaling pathway is not the
only mechanism underlying rottlerin anti-tumor activity.
Some studies have indicated that rottlerin decrease
carcinogenesis by impacting the mammalian target
of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling [27].
Furthermore, rottlerin inhibits the markers of angiogenesis
(COX-2, VEGF, VEGFR, and IL-8), and metastasis
(MMP-2 and MMP-9), thus blocking production of
tumorigenic mediators in the tumor microenvironment
[28]. Rottlerin also inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal
transition by up-regulating E-cadherin [29, 30]. According
to these studies, we know that the anti-neoplastic activity
of rottlerin is a multiple-signal pathway. The anti-tumor
activity of rotterlin against ACC warrants further study.
The recommended chemotherapy regimens for
ACC are etoposide +doxorubicin+cisplatin+mitotane
(EDP/M) or streptozotocin+mitotane (Sz/M). Whatever the
chemotherapy regimen, mitotane is a key agent; however,
the effective rate of treatment is only approximately 40%.
Moreover, mitotane has intense side effects, thus limiting
its clinical use [31, 32]. In this study, we attempted to

identify a novel agent which suppresses ACC more
efficiently and safer than traditional therapy. Based on our
results, rottlerin is a novel and potential chemotherapeutic
agent for ACC based on multiple signal pathway-related
anti-neoplastic activity.
Further studies should involve clinical trials better
defining the anti-neoplastic activity of combination
rottlerin and traditional chemotherapeutics or cytotoxic
drugs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture
The ACC cell lines, NCI-H295R and SW-13,
were purchased from the Cell Repository of the Chinese
Academy of Science and originated from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA).
The NCI-H295R cell line was cultured in DMEM
(GIBCO, Grand Island, NY,USA), supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (MPBIO, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
in a standard humidified incubator at 37°C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere. The SW-13 cell line was cultured in L15
media (GENOM, Shanghai, China) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum in a standard humidified incubator
at 37°C in an atmosphere without CO2.

Drugs and antibodies
R00ottlerin was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO, USA). Rottlerin was dissolved in dimethyl

sulfoxide (DMSO; GIBCO) at 10mM and stored in
dark at 4°C. The final concentrations of rottlerin used
for different experiments were prepared by diluting the
stock solution with media solution. The antibodies used
for Western blotting and immunohistochemistry staining
were as follows: anti-LRP6 and anti-p-LRP6 antibodies
were purchased from Affinity Bioscience (Cincinnati, OH,
USA); and anti-β-catenin antibody was purchased from
ABCAM (San Francisco, CA, USA).

NCI-H295R and SW-13 cells were cultured
in 6-well plates and treated with rottlerin in the dark
(concentration : 5 μM and 2.5 μM ). The control group was
not treated with rottlerin and a DMSO treated-group was
established as well. After incubation for 48 h, cells were
harvested, washed with PBS twice, resuspended in binding
buffer, stained with an annexin-V/PI solution (Dojindo) at
room temperature, then analyzed using a FACScan system
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).

Cell viability

Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB)
staining

NCI-H295R and SW-13 cells were plated at a
density of 2000 cells/well in flat bottom 96-well plates
(100μl media per well). After 24 h, cells were treated
with rottlerin at various concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and
8 μM) in the dark. Cell viability was measured after
24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h using the Cell Counting Kit
8 (Dojindo, Osaka, Japan) with a microplate reader at
450 nm. All experimental concentrations were assessed
in triplicate.The half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) was calculated with GraphPad Prism 5.

Morphologic assessment of apoptotic cells was
performed using the AO/EB staining method. NCIH295R and SW-13 cells were cultured in 6-well plates
(5 × 104 cells/ml). After a 24-h incubation, the cells were
treated with rottlerin in the dark (concentration = 5 μM
and 2.5 μM) for 48 h. After washing twice with PBS, the
cells were stained with 1ml of AO/EB (Sigma Aldrich)

microscope.Five hundred cells were counted under a
microscope (magnification  = 200×). The apoptosis rate
was calculated using the following formula: apoptosis
rate = (early apoptotic cells + late apoptotic cells)/the total
number of cells.The nuclei of early apoptotic cells had a
bright green fluorescence, the late apoptotic cell nuclei
had a bright orange fluorescence, and the nuclei of normal
cells had a ground glass-like dim green fluorescence.

pre-treated with the respective concentrations of rottlerin
(5 μM) for 24 h. The cells (1 × 105) in 0.2 ml of culture
medium without fetal bovine serum were added to the
upper chamber. The lower chamber was filled with 0.6 ml
of complete medium containing 30% fetal bovine serum.
After a 24 h incubation,cells remaining on the upper side
of the transwell membrane were removed using a cotton
swab.The membrane was washed with ice cold PBS
twice.Cells that invaded the underside were fixed with
4% formaldehyde, stained with crystal violet, and counted
in five randomly selected fields under a microscope
(magnification of 200×).
We also measured the migration rate using a wound
healing assay.SW-13 cells were plated in 6-well plates
(1 × 106cells/ml); after attachment the cells were scratched
using a sterile pipette tip.The experimental group was
treated with 5μM rottlerin. The cells were photographed
at various time points (0, 12, and 24 h; magnification =
100×). The migration rate at 24 h was calculated using the
following formula:migration rate = (1-the width of the cell
wound at 24 h/the width of the cell wound at 0 h)%.

Cell cycle analyses by flow cytometry
NCI-H295R and SW-13 cells were plated in 6-well
plates. After a 24 h incubation, the cells were treated with
rottlerin in the dark (concentration = 5 μM and 2.5 μM)
for 48 h. The cells were collected, washed twice in cold
PBS, mixed in 300 ml of 1×binding buffer, and incubated
at room temperature for 15 min with propidium iodide
(PI), NP-40, and RNaseA (Beyotime, Shanghai, China).
The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry and the
percentage of cells in the different phases was calculated
using ModFit LT software (Verity Software House).

Investigation Committee of the General Hospital of
Guangzhou Military Command. Mice were housed in a
standard animal laboratory with free access to water and
food. The mice were kept under constant environmental
conditions with a 12 h light-dark cycle. SW-13 cells
were (3 × 106 cells) suspended in 200 μl of serum-free
culture medium and inoculated subcutaneously in the flank
region of nude mice. Tumors were permitted to grow to
approximately 4mm, and mice were randomized into 4
treatment groups (control, DMSO, rottlerin 4 mg/kg, and
rottlerin 2 mg/kg) with 5 mice per group. All the mice were
injected intraperitoneally daily for 4 weeks. Rottlerin was
dissolved in DMSO, and diluted with normal saline (NS).
The control group was injected with 0.5 ml of NS and
the DMSO group was injected with 0.45 ml of NS mixed
with 50 μl of DSMO. The rottlerin groups were injected
with rottlerin (4 mg or 2 mg per kilogram). The mouse
weights and tumor volumes were monitored every 4 days.
Using Vernier calipers, the tumor volume was calculated
according to the following formula: A × B × B/2, where
A is the length of the tumor and B is the width. After
4 weeks, the mice were euthanized and the xenografts
were removed from the animals. Tumor tissues were
fixed in 10% formalin solution and paraffin-embedded.
The sample sections were prepared for hematoxylin and

treated for 15 min at 37°C with proteinase K (15 mg/ml in
10 mM Tris/HCl [pH 7.4–8.0]). Endogenous peroxidases
were blocked using 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol
at room temperature for 10 min. The tissue sections were
then analyzed with an in situ Cell Death Detection KitPOD (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. The reaction was visualized
using microscopy. Cell numbers of five randomly selected

in the dark (concentrations = 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 μM) for 48 h.
The cells were washed twice with PBS solution, then lysed
with RIPA Lysis Buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) and a
protease inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
Protein concentrations were determined with a Pierce BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime). Equivalent amounts of total
protein (60 μg) were boiled and electrophoretically separated
on a 10% polyacrylamide gel at 80 volts. The proteins were
transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The
membranes were blocked for 60 min with a 5% milk solution
prepared in PBS. The membranes were incubated overnight at
4°C with 1:500 (anti-p-LRP6 and anti-LRP6) or 1:3000 (antiβ-catenin) dilutions of the primary antibodies. The membranes
were washed three times for 5 min each with Tween 20
(1:1000 dilution in PBS) and incubated for 45 min with
the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(1:5000 dilution). The membranes were washed with Tween
20-PBS three times for 10 min each and were developed using
an Odyssey two-color infrared laser imaging system. The
signal generated by β-actin was used as an internal control.

Immunohistochemistry staining
Tumor tissues sections from paraffin-embedded
tumors were de-paraffinized and rehydrated using xylene
and ethanol, and immersed in 3% hydrogen peroxide
solution for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase.
Sections were boiled for 30 min in 10 mM citrate buffer
solution (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. Slides were
incubated for 45 min with 5% bovine serum albumin
and incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-LRP6, antip-LRP6, and anti-β-catenin antibodies. The specimens
were incubated for 45 min at 37°C with the appropriate
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized
using the DAB Detection Kit (BOSTER, Shanghai, China)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. All sections
with immunohistochemical staining were observed and
the pictures of 6 randomly selected but homogeneous in
staining and cell numbers fields (400×) were photographed
by an Olympus microscope (IX-70 OLYMPUS, Japan)
under high power view. The integrated optical density
(IOD) in each image was measured with the same setting
for all the slides, and the results were analyzed with
Image-ProPlus 6.0 software[33].

Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS17.0
software and all the data from at least three experiments
are presented as the mean ± S.D. The statistical difference
between the means was analyzed with a Student’s t-test or
one-way ANOVA. Compared with the control, a p < 0.05
was considered to be statistically significant.
