BACKGROUND. The combination of palonosetron and aprepitant is safe and effective in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced emesis (CIE). The purpose of
this pilot study was to ascertain the effectiveness of 1-day versus 3-day aprepitant in the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting in patients who

METHODS. This study was institutional review board-approved and informed consent was obtained before this study was begun. This was a pilot, single-institutreatment arms. All groups received palonosetron 0.25 mg intravenously on Day

on Day 1 and placebo on Days 2–3. Arm C received placebos on Days 1–3. The
primary endpoint was to evaluate the proportion of patients with acute and
delayed emesis within each group.

RESULTS. Seventy-five patients were included in the analysis. The study commenced with 3 groups; however, an interim analysis displayed unacceptable
emesis events in Arm C, and this group was terminated. There were no significant differences between Arms A and B for emesis, nausea, or the use of breakthrough antiemetics. In Arms A and B, 93% of patients were emesis-free from
Days 1–5 compared with only 50% in Arm C.

CONCLUSIONS. From this pilot study of patients who were receiving palonosetron,
aprepitant, and dexamethasone for highly emetogenic chemotherapy, a single
dose of aprepitant displayed similar effectiveness compared with 3-day aprepitant. Cancer 2008;112:2080–7.  2008 American Cancer Society.

ith the availability of palonosetron and aprepitant, the control
of acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced emesis (CIE) has
improved significantly. In comparison to ondansetron and dolasetron, palonosetron appears to be similar or to have enhanced efficacy in the prevention of acute and delayed CIE.1–3
Aprepitant is a substance P/neurokinin-1 (NK1)-receptor antagonist approved for use in combination with a 5-HT3–receptor antagonist and dexamethasone for acute and delayed CIE prevention. A
3-day oral aprepitant regimen in combination with ondansetron
plus dexamethasone has displayed effectiveness against acute
and delayed CIE associated with anthracycline-based breast cancer

regimens or cisplatin-containing regimens compared
with ondansetron antiemetics alone.4–9
The original, older formulation of aprepitant, L754,030, was evaluated in a single-day versus a 5-day
regimen.10 There were no significant differences in
the prevention of emesis in the acute or delayed setting. With the current United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved aprepitant formulation, there is a lack of data in a single-dose format.
Therefore, our study was designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of single-dose aprepitant on Day 1 of
chemotherapy versus 3-day aprepitant in combination with palonosetron and dexamethasone in
patients who were receiving highly emetogenic regimens.

Days 2 and 3. Arm C involved palonosetron 0.25 mg
intravenously and dexamethasone 18 mg orally on
Day 1. The dexamethasone and aprepitant were
encapsulated to maintain blinding among the 3
arms. On Days 1–3, placebo resembling aprepitant
was administered. All patients in the 3 study arms
received dexamethasone 8 mg orally daily on Days
2–4, and all received palonosetron 30 minutes before
chemotherapy and aprepitant or placebo 60 minutes
before chemotherapy. The primary efficacy endpoint
was the proportion of patients with emesis in the
acute (Day 1) and delayed (Days 2–5) phases after
chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints included assessment of prevention of acute and delayed nausea and
the use of breakthrough antiemetics. Complete
response was defined as no emesis nor use of breakthrough antiemetics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
The institutional review board approved this pilot,
single-institution, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparative trial. Eligible patients
were 18 years of age or older with histologically or
cytologically confirmed malignant disease and an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–2. The highly emetogenic regimens included cisplatin 50 mg/m2 or breast cancer
regimens that included anthracycline and cyclophosphamide combinations (eg, AC 5 doxorubicin,
cyclophosphamide; FEC 5 fluorouracil, epirubicin,
cyclophosphamide; TAC 5 docetaxel, doxorubicin,
cyclophosphamide). Patients were either chemotherapy-naive or chemotherapy non-naive with the last
chemotherapy separated by at least 3 weeks; however, study criteria demanded that they not have
greater than grade 1 nausea. Other exclusion criteria
included any patient who experienced an episode of
emesis within 24 hours before the start of chemotherapy or who had documented primary or secondary brain neoplasm, and any patient who was
receiving radiation to abdomen or pelvis, medications with known antiemetic activity, or medications
known to induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes (eg,
phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin).
After informed consent was obtained, the
patients were randomized to receive 1 of 3 regimens.
On Day 1, Arms A and B received a single dose of
palonosetron 0.25 mg intravenously and dexamethasone 12 mg orally before receiving highly emetogenic
chemotherapy. In Arm A, patients received the FDAapproved 3-day regimen of aprepitant 125 mg orally
on Day 1 followed by 80 mg orally per day on Days 2
and 3. Patients in Arm B received aprepitant 125 mg
orally on Day 1 followed by matching placebo on

Efficacy Parameters
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of
patients with emesis in the acute (Day 1) and
delayed (Days 2–5) phases after chemotherapy. A single emetic episode was defined as emesis separated
by less than a 5-minute interval. The secondary endpoints were the amount of breakthrough antiemetics
administered and the severity of nausea during the
120-hour study period. Breakthrough antiemetic
medications were defined as medications used to
treat CIE that did not respond to the initial prophylactic antiemetic regimen. Nausea severity was evaluated by using a 100-mm visual analog scale available
in the patient diary. Nausea was defined by a
patient’s report of a feeling in the stomach that he/
she may vomit. The 100-mm visual analog scale ranged from 0, defined as ‘‘no nausea’’, to 100, defined
as ‘‘the worst nausea possible.’’ If patients ranked
their nausea <5 mm , it was considered ‘‘no nausea’’
and if ranked <25 mm, it was considered ‘‘no significant nausea’’. Patients had a diary to document the
number of emetic episodes, breakthrough nausea
medications, and nausea severity during the 120hour observation period after the infusion of chemotherapy. A study coordinator provided follow-up
communications with the patients to ensure adherence to the required diary documentation and with
the study medications.
Statistical Analyses
After the first 50 patients were randomized, an
unplanned interim analysis was completed because
of reports from the study coordinator that patients
were experiencing severe emesis. It was found that
all of the patients experiencing emesis were in Arm

halted, and the protocol was amended with the removal of Arm C. The descriptive statistics of patients
in Arm C will be presented, but this study group will
not be included in the statistical comparison among
groups.
The demographic data of study participants were
reported by using descriptive statistics. Baseline
comparisons of demographic data were performed
using chi-square or Fisher Exact tests for categorical
data and 2-sided, 2-sample t tests for continuous
data. When the continuous data were strongly
skewed, the Wilcoxon nonparametric procedure was
used. To assess the main specific aim, the Fisher
Exact test was used to compare the proportion of
patients with no emetic episodes between the 2
treatment arms. The secondary objectives of the
study were reported by using descriptive statistics

and were compared by using the 2-sided, 2-sample t
test. When secondary outcomes data were skewed,
the Wilcoxon nonparametric test was used. The
designated level of statistical significance was <.05.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Patients were evaluated between June 2005 and May
2007. Eighty-two patients were randomized to receive
a treatment. Three patients refused or failed screening, 2 patients did not receive antiemetics as randomized, and 2 patients did not receive chemotherapy
on the study day. For the study, 75 patients
remained. All treatment groups received palonosetron 0.25 mg, whereas 29 patients received the 3-day
aprepitant regimen, 30 patients received a singledose aprepitant, and 16 patients received placebo. As

described in the statistics section, only Arms A and B
were statistically compared. For the complete
response endpoint, 1 patient in Arm A versus 3
patients in Arm B did not return their patient diaries;
therefore, those patients were excluded. All patients
included in the analysis had 100% adherence to the
study’s medication regimen.
Table 1 lists the demographic data for 75
patients. There were no statistically significant differences between Arms A and B. The most common
malignancy types included breast carcinoma (44.8%
vs 56.7% in Arms A and B, respectively), lung (20.7%
vs 10%), and head and neck (13.8% vs 23.3%). The
majority (100% vs 93%) of patients were chemotherapy naive. There were no differences in body surface
area, ECOG scores, history of motion sickness, and

pregnancy-induced vomiting among the different
patient groups. The types of chemotherapy and their
median doses were similar among groups, except the
cyclophosphamide dosage (Table 2). The median
doses of cyclophosphamide were 500 mg/m2, 600
mg/m2, and 600 mg/m2, respectively, for the aprepitant 3-day, aprepitant 1-day, and placebo groups
(P 5 .04).

The proportion of patients without emesis during the
first 24 hours was similar between Arms A and B

Other Efficacy Endpoints and Safety
The incidence of overall nausea, significant nausea
(>25 mm on the 100-mm visual analog scale), and
the severity of nausea was not different among the
3 arms (Table 4 and Fig. 2). In addition, the frequency of rescue antiemetics was also similar
among the 3 groups (Table 5). During the first 24
hours, complete response (shown in Table 6 and
Fig. 3) was similar between Arms A and B (66.7% vs
70.4%; P 5 .77). This effect carried over to the
delayed phase in which 63% of Arm A and 59% of
Arm B displayed no emesis or use of breakthrough
medications. Only 55.6% of Arm A and 51.9% of
Arm B patients displayed a complete response during both phases (P 5 .78). There were no reports of
serious adverse events that were related to study
medication.

DISCUSSION
The current pilot study suggests that a single 125-mg
dose of aprepitant provides similar effectiveness
compared with the traditional 3-day regimen. When
aprepitant was used in combination with palonosetron and dexamethasone, it provided protection
against emesis in more than 90% of patients during
the 5-day study period. This finding is similar to that
of other aprepitant-containing antiemetic studies.
The use of aprepitant has been shown to be
effective in preventing acute and delayed emesis in
patients who are receiving cisplatin and, also, anthracycline-containing therapies. In 1999, Navari and
colleagues10 published a comparison trial with the
original aprepitant formulation, L-754,030, combined
with granisetron and dexamethasone. Their Group 1
patients received L-754,030 400 mg orally on Day 1
and then aprepitant 300 mg orally on Days 2–5,
while Group 2 received only L-754,030 400 mg orally
on Day 1. All groups received granisetron plus dexamethasone in which Group 3 did not receive L754,030. There were no differences between emetic
episodes or the number of rescue medications used
in acute-emesis and delayed-emesis phases between
Groups 1 and 2. However, compared with Group 3,
the results were significantly in favor of the L-754,030
Groups 1 and 2.
Similar observations were reported by Van Belle
and colleagues11 who compared NK-1 receptor antagonist combinations with ondansetron and dexamethasone in patients who were receiving cisplatinbased chemotherapy regimens. Their Group 1
patients received the intravenous prodrug formulation of aprepitant (L-758,298) 100 mg on Day 1 followed by L-754,030 300 mg orally on Days 2–5.
Group 2 received L-758,298 100 mg intravenously on

Day 1 followed by placebo on Days 2–5, while Group
3 received ondansetron 32 mg intravenously on Day
1 followed by placebo on Days 2–5. All 3 groups
received dexamethasone before chemotherapy on
Day 1. There was a significant decrease in the number of emetic episodes during the delayed phase

(Days 2–5) in both Groups 1 and 2 compared with
Group 3. However, there was no statistical difference
in the proportion of patients without emesis during
the delayed phase between Groups 1 and 2.
Since the publication of both the Navari and Van
Belle studies, L-754,030 (original aprepitant) has
been reformulated the into a nanoparticle (NanoCrystal; Elan, Dublin, Ireland) colloidal-dispersion
formulation. Unfortunately, further studies using single-dose aprepitant were not subsequently conducted
using the current reformulated, FDA-approved product. A study by Wu and colleagues12 demonstrated in
a Beagle (dog model) that the nanoparticle formulation increased bioavailability, had faster absorption,
and eliminated food effects on absorption compared
with the original, conventional, micronized aprepitant formulation.
Recently published in abstract form, a singlearm, open-labeled study evaluated the 5-day effectiveness of aprepitant 285 mg in a single daily
dose before moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.13
Patients received palonosetron 0.25 mg intravenously
plus dexamethasone 20 mg orally and aprepitant 285
mg orally as a single dose. All 32 patients had breast

cancer and received an anthracycline-cyclophosphamide combination regimen. The complete response
(no emesis and no rescue antiemetics) was 78% in
the acute phase, 59% in the delayed phase, and 50%
overall. Patients without emesis were 100% in the
acute period and 97% for the delayed and overall
periods. In addition, 75% of patients in the acute
phase, 62% in the delayed phase, and 56% overall
did not have significant nausea (<25 mm on visual
analog scale). It is unknown if this larger aprepitant
dose will have any effect on the drug-interaction profile against the potentially susceptible chemotherapy
agents such as cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin.
The regimen of palonosetron and aprepitant has
demonstrated effectiveness in breast cancer patients
who are receiving anthracycline-containing regimens.14 Results in the current trial mirror those
results published elsewhere. It would be interesting
to inquire whether similar results would be seen by
using another 5-HT3–receptor antagonist. A recent
abstract described the receptor-interaction differences between different 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.15
In that trial, palonosetron exhibited competitive and
allosteric interactions with the 5-HT3 receptor. However, ondansetron and granisetron displayed only
competitive antagonism of the 5-HT3 receptor. In
theory, this interaction could explain the increased
efficacy in emesis control between palonosetron and
other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.
Several design characteristics of our clinical trial
are worth examining. First, this was a randomized,
placebo-controlled trial, which limits the potential
for bias to influence results. Second, we chose to
enroll a population of high-risk patients who were
receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. These
groups of patients were mainly breast cancer patients
(54.7%) and patients who were receiving high-dose
cisplatin (45.3%). In the palonosetron and placebo
Arm C, most patients were breast cancer patients
(68.8%) and also possessed more adverse prognostic
factors (eg, history of motion-induced and pregnancy-induced sicknesses) compared with the other
2 groups. The 5 patients who received cisplatin also
received a higher median dose of cisplatin (100 mg
vs 75 mg, 80 mg) compared with the aprepitant
Groups A and B, respectively. It is unknown whether
all of these disparities can explain the reason for a
poorer outcome in delayed-emesis control compared
with the aprepitant arms. Nevertheless, because of
higher rate of failures with Arm C, this study group
was subsequently closed.
It is interesting to note that there is a trend for
larger complete response with the 3-day aprepitant
regimen versus the single-dose regimen in the

delayed and combined phases but not in the acute
phase. The differences are not statistically significant;
however, this issue will have to be addressed in a
larger trial. There was no significant difference in the
primary objective of the trial. The prevention of
emesis throughout the acute and delayed phases was
achieved in 92.9% of the 3-day aprepitant versus
92.6% in the single-day aprepitant arm.
The control of nausea was achieved in similar
fashion between the 2 aprepitant arms. However,
there was a trend toward better significant nausea
prevention on Days 4–5 with the 3-day Arm A versus
the single dose. In the 3-day arm, 88.5% versus
69.2% did not have significant nausea as defined by
<25 mm on the visual analog scale (P 5 .09). It is
unlikely that there is a true difference present
because previously published data has not found a
disparity. According to its package insert, aprepitant
fails to demonstrate improved efficacy over placebo
for the prevention of nausea (overall and significant
nausea) in acute or delayed phases.16
In conclusion, the current study has demonstrated that a single dose of aprepitant 125 mg has
similar effectiveness as the 3-day aprepitant regimen.
These findings are similar to previous, older formulation, aprepitant studies, which compared a single
dose to 5 days of aprepitant therapy. In addition, the
use of a single 125 mg dose would equate to lower
drug cost with similar effectiveness for highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimens. With this combination of palonosetron and aprepitant, greater than
90% of patients can be emesis-free during Days 1–5
after chemotherapy.
