Abstract

Author Manuscript

β-arrestins 1 and 2 are multifunctional adaptor proteins originally discovered for their role in
desensitizing seven-transmembrane receptor signaling via the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide
binding proteins. Recently identified roles of β-arrestins include regulation of cancer cell
chemotaxis and proliferation. Herein we report that β-arrestin1 expression regulates breast tumor
colonization in nude mice and cancer cell viability during hypoxia. β-arrestin1 robustly interacts
with nuclear hypoxia-induced factor 1α (HIF-1α) that is stabilized during hypoxia and potentiates
HIF-1-dependent transcription of the angiogenic factor VEGF-A. Increased expression of βarrestin1 in human breast cancer (infiltrating ductal carcinoma or IDC and metastatic IDC)
correlates with increased levels of VEGF-A. While the anti-angiogenic drug thalidomide inhibits
HIF-1-dependent VEGF transcription in breast carcinoma cells, it does not prevent HIF-1α
stabilization, but leads to aberrant localization of HIF-1α to the perinuclear compartments and
surprisingly stimulates nuclear export of β-arrestin1. Additionally, imatinib mesylate that inhibits
release of VEGF induces nuclear export of β-arrestin1-HIF-1α complexes. Our findings suggest
that β-arrestin1 regulates nuclear signaling during hypoxia to promote survival of breast cancer
cells via VEGF signaling and that drugs that induce its translocation from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm could be useful in anti-angiogenic and breast cancer therapies.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

β-arrestin1 (aka arrestin2) and β-arrestin2 (aka arrestin3) are ubiquitously expressed
multifunctional signaling adaptor proteins originally discovered for their role in
desensitizing seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs or 7TMRs)
(Lefkowitz & Shenoy, 2005). β-arrestins regulate both GPCR and non-GPCR pathways,
under normal as well as pathological conditions including cancer (Lefkowitz et al., 2006).
The two β-arrestin isoforms share roughly 70% sequence identity and in general perform
similar functions in GPCR regulation (for example, receptor desensitization) (Lefkowitz &
Shenoy, 2005). Studies utilizing siRNA-mediated depletion and individual isoform repletion
of β-arrestin1/2 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts have revealed differential roles in the
extent of their endocytic and signaling functions with respect to some GPCRs and the two
isoforms can sometimes function in a reciprocal manner to regulate GPCR signaling
(DeWire et al., 2007). Of the two β-arrestin isoforms, β-arrestin2 is excluded from the
nucleus due to the presence of a Nuclear Export Signal (NES), that is absent in β-arrestin1
(Kang et al., 2005; Scott et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2003).

Author Manuscript

Previous studies indicate that both β-arrestins play a crucial role in mitogenic signaling and
chemotaxis of cancer cells (Alvarez et al., 2009; Buchanan et al., 2006; Dasgupta et al.,
2006; Ge et al., 2004; Girnita et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009; Raghuwanshi et al., 2008; Rosano
et al., 2009; Zou et al., 2008). In a human colorectal carcinoma cell line, β-arrestin1
mediated c-Src activation was found to be necessary for the transactivation of the growth
factor receptor EGFR and downstream AKT activation as well as for cellular chemotaxis in
vitro (Buchanan et al., 2006). Transgenic overexpression of β-arrestin1 leads to rapid tumor
progression and increased angiogenesis in mice (Zou et al., 2008). β-arrestin2 facilitates the
rapid endocytosis of vascular endothelial cadherin in response to vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) stimulation leading to endothelial cell permeability (Gavard &
Gutkind, 2006). β-arrestin2 also mediates endocytosis and downregulation of transforming
growth factor-beta type III receptor and low levels of this receptor are correlated with cancer
invasiveness (Mythreye & Blobe, 2009). Recent studies have shown that β-arrestin2
specifically acts as a repressor of androgen receptor activity in prostate cancer cells
(Lakshmikanthan et al., 2009) and β-arrestin2 KO mice display enhanced lung tumor
metastasis (Raghuwanshi et al., 2008). Thus, there is increasing evidence that β-arrestin1 is
associated with cell invasion and proliferation in multiple types of tumors, while β-arrestin2
is bifunctional and promotes or represses specific cancers. While the overexpression of βarrestin1 accelerates tumor progression in mice, it is unclear whether endogenous β-arrestin1
expression and/or activity are correlated with malignancy.

Malignant transformation of breast tumors involves up-regulation of angiogenic factors
resulting from tumor hypoxia. Additionally, localized hypoxia in tumors renders them
resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. The hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is
recognized as the master transcriptional switch during hypoxia, and activates >100 genes
crucial for the cellular adaptation to low oxygen tension (Semenza, 2007). The HIF-1
transcription factor is a heterodimer consisting of the oxygen-regulated HIF-1α subunit and
oxygen-insensitive HIF-1β subunit (aka aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator,
ARNT) (Wang et al., 1995). Under normoxia, HIF-1α is hydroxylated at specific proline

residues, which leads to its ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase and tumor suppressor
pVHL (Maxwell et al., 1999). Consequently, HIF-1α subunit is continuously degraded by
the 26S proteasome. During hypoxia, prolyl hydroxylation does not occur and hence HIF-1α
is not ubiquitinated and degraded. Stabilized HIF-1α translocates into the nucleus,
heterodimerizes with HIF-1β to form a functional transcription factor and binds to specific
promoter regions known as hypoxia responsive elements (HRE) to induce transcription of
many genes especially those required for angiogenesis (e.g. VEGF), cell survival (e.g.
insulin-like growth factor, IGF2), glucose metabolism (e.g. glucose transporter, GLUT1)
and invasion (e.g. transforming growth factor α, TGFα) (Semenza, 2007). It is also
suggested that optimal HIF-1 activity requires p300 binding (Arany et al., 1996) and might
involve other juxtaposed transcriptional elements such as AP-1 (Kvietikova et al., 1995).

Herein, we report a novel interaction between β-arrestin1 and HIF-1α occurring in breast
carcinoma cells and further show that this interaction is crucial for HIF-1 dependent gene
transcription. We find a positive correlation between β-arrestin1 and VEGF-A expression
levels in metastatic human breast cancer tissues, suggesting that β-arrestin1-dependent
signaling during adaptation to hypoxia regulates breast tumor metastasis.

RESULTS
β-arrestin1 is up-regulated in invasive breast carcinoma

Author Manuscript

In the human genome, the β-arrestin1 gene maps to chromosome locus 11q13, which is often
amplified in breast cancer (Chuaqui et al., 1997; Letessier et al., 2006). While β-arrestin1
overexpression promotes tumor growth in mice (Zou et al., 2008), transcriptome and gene
profiling studies do not identify an increase in β-arrestin mRNA in breast cancer (Ma et al.,
2003; Minn et al., 2005; Niida et al., 2009). On the other hand, we have found a dramatic
increase in β-arrestin1 protein levels in invasive breast carcinoma cells (MDAMB-231)
when compared with non invasive cells (HEK-293) and normal breast epithelial cells (Hs
578Bst, ATCC) (Fig 1A–C). β-arrestin2 is also expressed in MDAMB-231, but at much
lower levels than in both HEK-293 and Hs 578Bst. Additionally in the above noninvasive
cells, β-arrestin2 is the more abundant isoform.

We next analyzed the β-arrestin1 protein levels in normal and cancer tissue cores
(MaxArray™human breast carcinoma tissue microarray slides) by immunostaining with antiβarrestin1 antibody (A1CT). About 70% of the IDC tissue sections analyzed had increased
levels of β-arrestin1 and its expression was significantly higher in IDC than in normal breast
specimens (Fig 1D–E). Qualitatively similar immunostaining patterns were obtained with a
second β-arrestin1 specific antibody (BD Biosciences), but very weak signals were observed
with secondary antibody alone or with the anti-β-arrestin2 A2CT (Fig S1). Hence, the βarrestin isoform detected in these tissues is predominantly β-arrestin1.
β-arrestin knockdown retards colonization and growth of breast carcinoma cells in
experimental metastasis assays
Previous studies have indicated that both β-arrestins 1 and 2 are required for chemotaxis of
breast cancer cells (Ge et al., 2004), thereby suggesting that both isoforms might regulate

spread of cancer in vivo. Accordingly, we transfected MDAMB-231 cells stably expressing
luciferase (231-luc) with either control siRNA or β-arrestin1/2 specific siRNA, injected the
cells via tail vein into female nude mice, and performed bioluminescence imaging
(Xenogen™ in vivo imaging systems) to track metastatic spread of cancer. After tail vein
injections, we detected and quantified the signals in vivo over a period of 5 weeks using the
Living Image acquisition and analysis software (Living Image®, Xenogen). Although the
uptake of both control and β-arrestin1/2 knockdown cells in the lungs was similar at 24
hours, stable lung colonization was observed only in control-treated mice but not in mice
that received β-arrestin-depleted cells (Fig 2A–B). Aliquots of cells used for the injection
were immunoblotted for β-arrestin1/2 levels and analyzed for luciferase expression. As
depicted in Fig 2C–D, β-arrestin1/2 knockdown cells had 15–20% more luciferase activity
than control cells and β-arrestins 1 and 2 were completely knocked down. Additionally, we
tested the effect of β-arrestin1 knockdown on the metastatic spread of murine breast cancer
cells (4T1) that cause more aggressive tumor metastasis than MDAMB-231 cells in nude
mice models. Tail-vein injection of 4T1 cells depleted of β-arrestin1 expression (~80%
knockdown) led to delayed tumor growth and an increase in the survival of nude mice (Fig
2E–F). These data corroborate previous reports that β-arrestins 1 and 2 are critical for tumor
metastasis, and identify that β-arrestins1 and/or 2 are required for viability of breast cancer
cells in vivo. Additionally, the experiments with 4T1 cells convey a critical role for βarrestin1 in breast cancer progression.
β-arrestin1 expression is critical for the viability of breast carcinoma cells under hypoxic
stress

To discern whether expression of β-arrestins 1 and 2 affects cancer cell viability, we
performed CellTiter-Glo® (Promega) luminescent cell viability assay on breast carcinoma
cells transfected with siRNA targeting no mRNA (control), β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2. This
assay is based on the quantification of the cellular ATP present, which indicates the presence
of metabolically active cells. Under normoxia, no significant differences were observed
between control and β-arrestin knockdown cells suggesting that the general cell viability is
unaffected by the depletion of β-arrestin1 or 2. Interestingly, when we treated the cells for
24 hours with 100 μM Cobalt Chloride (CoCl2) a well-accepted hypoxia mimetic (Wang &
Semenza, 1995), or induced hypoxia by growing cells in low (1%) oxygen, cell viability was
significantly reduced in β-arrestin1- but not β-arrestin2- depleted cells when compared with
cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig 3). It is known that cancer cells undergo genetic
and adaptive changes that allow their survival in a hypoxic environment. Above findings
suggest that β-arrestin1 expression facilitates cell survival during hypoxia by influencing
adaptive gene programming via its signaling roles.

β-arrestin1 interacts with the oxygen-regulated transcription factor HIF-1α
Based on the effect of β-arrestin1 knockdown on cell survival during hypoxia (Fig 3), and on
the knowledge about its nuclear localization and nuclear function in forming a complex with
p300 that regulates HIF-1 activity (Arany et al., 1996, Kang et al., 2005), we hypothesized
that β-arrestin1 could be modulating the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α, thus regulating
the survival of breast carcinoma cells during hypoxia.

To assess whether the β-arrestin-HIF-1α interaction occurs in cells expressing endogenous
amounts of the two proteins, we prepared extracts from MDAMB-231 cells that were treated
with vehicle or CoCl2 and tested the interaction by immunoprecipitation and
immunoblotting. β-arrestin1 was detected in HIF-1α IPs but not in IPs with control IgG (Fig
4A). β-arrestin-HIF-1α binding was also detected in β-arrestin IPs isolated from nuclear
extracts of MDAMB-231 cells after CoCl2 treatment (Fig 4B). Furthermore, we detected
colocalization of β-arrestin1 and HIF-1α in the nuclei of CoCl2-treated MDAMB-231 cells
upon immunostaining and confocal microscopy (Fig 4C). The exclusive cytoplasmic
distribution of β-arrestin2 is attributed to the presence of a nuclear export signal (NES) that
is absent in β-arrestin1 (Scott et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2003). Introduction of this NES in βarrestin1 (βarr1Q394L) changes its subcellular distribution to be totally cytoplasmic (Wang
et al., 2003). When we compared β-arrestin1, β-arrestin1Q394L and β-arrestin2 for their
binding to HIF-1α, only the wild type β-arrestin1 formed a robust complex with HIF-1α (Fig
4D–E). These findings establish that both β-arrestin1 and HIF-1α interact in the nuclear
compartment of breast cancer cells during hypoxia.
β-arrestin1 regulates the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α

To test if the above β-arrestin1-HIF-1α interaction has functional consequences, we
analyzed the effect of β-arrestin1 expression on HIF-1-mediated transcription during
hypoxia. One of the most characterized HIF-dependent genes is the potent endothelial
mitogen, VEGF-A, which regulates endothelial cell proliferation and blood vessel formation
in both normal and cancerous tissues (Liu et al., 1995). The VEGF-A gene contains a HRE
in its 5′ UTR (untranslated region) and hypoxia induces a rapid and sustained increase in
VEGF-A mRNA levels. To assess if HIF-1-dependent VEGF induction involves β-arrestin,
we used a luciferase reporter system in which hypoxia-responsive elements (5XHRE)
derived from the 5′ UTR of the human VEGF gene is ligated upstream of the firefly
luciferase gene (Fig 5A). 5XHRE reporter transfection alone led to some basal promoter
activity in MDAMB-231 cells. Nonetheless, treatment of cells with CoCl2 or reduced
oxygen levels (1%) significantly increased the luciferase activity (Fig 5B). This hypoxiainduced increase was not observed in cells with β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin1/2 knockdown
whereas β-arrestin2 depletion did not significantly change reporter activity (Fig 5B–C).
These data suggest that HIF-1 dependent transcriptional activity during hypoxia is regulated
specifically by β-arrestin1 expression in MDAMB-231 cells. Additionally, we tested HIF-1α
mediated transcriptional activity under β-arrestin1 null and replete conditions in a βarrestin1/2 double knockout cell line (Kohout et al., 2001). Although we found a 1.8 fold
CoCl2-induced increase in HIF-1 transcriptional response in these β-arrestin null fibroblasts,
restoration of β-arrestin1 expression led to a dramatic increase (6–7 fold) in HIF- mediated
transcription during hypoxia (Fig 5D–E). Thus, β-arrestin1 augments HIF-1 directed
transcription and there could be potential β-arrestin1-dependent signals with vital roles
during hypoxia.
Increase in VEGF levels in invasive ductal carcinoma correlates with increase in βarrestin1 levels
Because we observed an increase in β-arrestin1 expression in IDCs (Fig 1), and because βarrestin1 expression correlated with HIF-1 transcriptional activity in MDAMB-231 cells

(Fig 5), we wondered if this would be reflected in the levels of either HIF-1α or the
downstream target of HIF-1, VEGF-A, in IDCs. We analyzed β-arrestin1 and VEGF protein
expression by immunostaining with the antibodies anti-β-arrestin1 (A1CT) and anti-VEGFA (mouse monoclonal C-1), followed by respective secondary antibodies, one conjugated to
Alexa Fluor® 488 and the other to Alexa Fluor® 594 (see methods). A representative set of
confocal images for normal, IDC and metastatic IDC is shown in Fig 6A. The data acquired
for β-arrestin1 and VEGF immunostaining for normal breast (n=10 tissue samples, 22
images), IDC (n=79 tissue samples, 112 images) and metastatic carcinoma in lymph node
(n= 7 tissue samples, 12 images) is summarized as bar graphs in Fig 6B. Although VEGF
expression varied from undetectable to very high levels among the different cancer samples,
overall both β-arrestin1 and VEGF levels were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in IDC
samples than in normal breast tissues. Despite various immunostaining attempts with
available HIF-1α antibodies, we were unable to detect a specific signal for this protein in
these breast tissue arrays. Additionally, although there was no direct relationship between
the increase in β-arrestin1 and presence of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor or
expression of p53 in these IDC samples (Supplementary Table 1), we found a positive
correlation between β-arrestin1 expression and VEGF-A (Fig 6C). These findings suggest
that an increase in β-arrestin expression could enhance HIF-1 dependent transcription of
VEGF-A in neoplastic and metastatic breast cancer.
Inhibition of VEGF secretion by anti-angiogenic compounds results from a disruption of βarrestin1-HIF-1 signaling

The immunomodulatory drug thalidomide was previously shown to suppress angiogenesis,
although the mechanism was not unknown (D’Amato et al., 1994; Figg, 2006; Holaday &
Berkowitz, 2009). It was further suggested that thalidomide inhibits secretion of VEGF from
tumors and bone marrow stromal cells leading to decreased endothelial cell migration and
adhesion (Dredge et al., 2002; Vacca et al., 2005). When we treated MDAMB-231 cells with
thalidomide, we saw a complete inhibition of hypoxia-induced HIF-1-dependent
transcription as measured by 5XHRE luciferase reporter activity (Fig 7A). Paradoxically,
HIF-1α stabilization during hypoxia was not affected and similar amounts of HIF-1α were
detected in cell extracts with or without thalidomide treatment (Fig 7B). However, when we
analyzed β-arrestin1 distribution in thalidomide-treated cells we observed a predominant
cytoplasmic translocation of endogenous β-arrestin1 from the nucleus and only 10–15%
protein remained in the nucleus as assessed by immunostaining (Fig 7C). Furthermore,
while hypoxia induced a robust HIF-1α and β-arrestin1 colocalization in the nuclear
compartment, addition of thalidomide under hypoxia resulted in relocation of β-arrestin1HIF-1 complexes to the perinuclear compartments (Fig 7D). Additionally, the tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, which has been shown to exhibit anti-angiogenic effects
(Vlahovic et al., 2006) caused a similar mislocalization of β-arrestin1-HIF-1α into
perinuclear compartments (Fig 7D). However, unlike thalidomide, treatment of
MDAMB-231 cells with imatinib inhibited the accumulation of HIF-1α during hypoxia (Fig
7E). These data strongly suggest that β-arrestin1-HIF-1 interaction in the nucleus is required
for inducing VEGF transcription and secretion in carcinoma cells. Moreover, drugs that can
cause nuclear export of β-arrestin1 could prove useful in reducing gene transcription during
hypoxia and serve as inhibitors of breast cancer angiogenesis.

DISCUSSION
Recent studies have indicated that in addition to the neoplastic role played by GPCRs and G
proteins in a variety of cancers (Daaka, 2004), β-arrestins may also play a crucial role in the
progression of colorectal, ovarian and lung cancer in mice (Buchanan et al., 2006;
Raghuwanshi et al., 2008; Rosano et al., 2009). We have found that β-arrestin1 regulates
breast cancer cell survival during hypoxia through a novel interaction with the transcription
factor, HIF-1. Additionally, our analyses of human breast tumors indicate that an up
regulation of β-arrestin1 correlates with an increase in VEGF-A, a key regulator of tumor
angiogenesis. Our data also establishes that nuclear export of β-arrestin1 disrupts HIF-1dependent transcription of VEGF-A, and that formation and localization of β-arrestinHIF-1α complexes could be fundamental for cell survival during hypoxia.

Author Manuscript

Thus far, few studies have addressed the mechanistic role of β-arrestins in promoting nuclear
transcription (Kang et al., 2005). However, its role in inhibiting nuclear transcription has
dominated among the spectrum of its recently discovered functions (DeWire et al., 2007).
The finding that β-arrestin1 binds and potentiates HIF-1 activity provides an exciting and
unexpected view of how signal transduction during hypoxia might be regulated. We propose
that β-arrestin1 acts as a scaffolding protein for recruiting and stabilizing HIF-1 and thus
regulating gene transcription during hypoxia. Whether this involves binding of β-arrestin1
with other co-factors to promote HIF-1α and HIF-1β dimerization or whether β-arrestin1
prevents binding of repressor elements that inhibit HIF-1 activity remains to be determined.
Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate a novel role of β-arrestin1 in promoting expression of
the HIF-1 transcriptional target VEGF-A.

VEGF-A belongs to a family of cytokines that bind to and activate VEGF receptors to
stimulate proliferation, migration and recruitment of endothelial cells (Ferrara et al., 2003;
Leung et al., 1989). VEGFA-VEGFR2 interaction plays a crucial role in both developmental
and pathological angiogenesis and there is increased expression of these molecules in many
solid tumors. The importance of targeting tumor angiogenesis was suggested in early 1970’s
(Folkman et al., 1971) and has since led to cancer drugs targeting this pathway, such as
Bevacizumab (a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds VEGFA), VEGF-Trap (soluble
fusion proteins of extra cellular domains of VEGFRs1 and 2 and the Fc portion of human
IgG), Sunitinib (VEGFR and RTK inhibitor) (Holaday & Berkowitz, 2009). These
molecules bind either the VEGF ligand or its receptor and thus prevent signal transduction
that is required for endothelial cell proliferation and subsequent angiogenesis. Previous
studies have also shown that thalidomide (that has re-emerged as a drug for multiple
myeloma) and imatinib (that inhibits c-Abl and other tyrosine kinases) reduce the
accumulation of VEGF as well as inhibit tumor angiogenesis and growth, although the exact
mechanism was not known (Beppu et al., 2004; D’Amato et al., 1994; Ebos et al., 2002;
Figg, 2006; Holaday & Berkowitz, 2009; Vlahovic et al., 2006),. Our studies reveal that
these latter two compounds prevent β-arrestin1-HIF1α interaction in the nuclear
compartment during hypoxia and inhibit VEGF transcription. In summary, our findings
strongly suggest that β-arrestin1 has a pro-angiogenic role in breast carcinoma, and
predictably, drugs that inhibit its nuclear activity or stimulate nuclear export could be useful
in inhibiting breast cancer angiogenesis and metastasis.

Binding between endogenous or overexpressed β-arrestin and endogenous HIF-1α was
analyzed by immunoprecipitation after chemical cross-linking using Dithio-bismaleimidoethane (DTME, Pierce). Monolayers of MDAMB-231 cells on 150 mm dishes
were incubated in 21% O2 (normoxia), 1% O2 (hypoxia) or treated with 100 μM CoCl2
(hypoxia-mimetic) for 5 hours. Next the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline
(pH 7.5) containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) (PBS/HEPES) and incubated in PBS/HEPES
along with 2mM DTME (dissolved in 50% DMSO) on a rotator platform at room
temperature. After 30 min, excess crosslinker was removed by washing the cells twice with
PBS/HEPES and cells scraped into 1 mL RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors. After
rotating the cell extracts at 4 oC for 1–2 hours, clarified cell extracts were subjected to

immunoprecipitation. To isolate nuclear proteins for IP, first cells were subjected to lysis
with a hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5
mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF). Lysed cells were incubated on ice for 10 min and NP40 was
added (final 0.3%) after which nuclei were precipitated by centrifugation. The nuclei were
washed once with PBS, nuclear proteins were solubilized in RIPA buffer and used for
immunoprecipitation. To immunoprecipitate β-arrestin, 2 μg anti-β-arrestin antibody (K-16,
SantaCruz) and protein A/G conjugated agarose were mixed with 800 μg of cellular protein.
To isolate HIF-1α IPs, 3 μg of anti-HIF-1α antibody, ProteinA/G conjugated agarose and
800 μg of cellular protein were used. To test the role of NES in HIF-1 binding,
MDAMB-231 cells were transfected with β-arrestin1-Flag, β-arrestin1 (Q394L)-Flag or βarrestin2-Flag (5 μg/150 mm dish) with Lipofectamine2000 reagent. 48h after transfection,
cells were exposed to hypoxia as above and harvested in RIPA buffer. Soluble cell extracts
weremixed with anti-Flag M2 agarose beads and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific
binding in the IPs was eliminated by repeated wash and centrifugation steps. Samples were
eluted with SDS-sample buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to

Cells were plated on collagen-coated35-mm glass bottom plates and incubated in 21% O2
(normoxia), 1% O2 (hypoxia) or treated with 100 μM CoCl2 (hypoxia-mimetic) for 5 hours.
Following this, cells were fixed with 5% formaldehyde dilutedin PBS containing calcium
and magnesium, permeabilizedwith 0.08% Triton X-100™ (cat# T-9284, Sigma) in PBS
containing 2% bovine serum albuminfor 30 min and incubated with appropriateprimary
antibody O/N at 4°C, followed by the respective secondary antibody. To label β-arrestin1,
anti-β-arrestin1 antibody (A1CT) was used at 1:300 dilution in 2 % BSA followed by Alexa
Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L). HIF-1α was detected with a mouse monoclonal
anti-HIF-1α antibody (1:300 dilution) followed by Alexa Fluor® 594 goat anti-mouse IgG
(H+L). Confocal images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning microscope
usingmultitrack sequential excitation (488 and 568 nm) andemission (515–540 nm, GFP;
585–615 nm, Texas Red) filter sets using either 100X or 40 X oil immersion objectives.

Breast tissue sections on Zymed MaxArray Human Breast Carcinoma (60 cancer cores plus
1 normal tissue) and IMGENEX HISTO-Array tissue microarray slides (50 cancer cores
plus 10 normal) were deparaffinized and rehydrated. After this the sections were incubated
in a blocking buffer (3% BSA) in a humidified chamber. β-arrestin1 and HIF-1α were
immunostained as above. To detect β-arrestin2, anti-β-arrestin2 antibody A2CT (1:250
dilution) was used. VEGF-A was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody followed by
Alexa Fluor® 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) and nuclei were labelled with DRAQ5
(Alexis Corporation). Confocal images were acquired in a random order for different
samples in a tissue microarray by high-resolution confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510, and
40X or 100X oil immersion objective). Sections that were stained only with secondary

antibodies served as negative controls. Pixel intensities for different fluorophore signals in
each image were determined with the MetaMorph software.
Luciferase Reporter Assay
MDAMB-231 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmid alone or with different
siRNA oligonucleotides (control, βarr1, βarr2 or βarr1/2) using Lipofectamine 2000. 48
hours later transfected cells were plated on 24-well dishes. Next day cells were serumstarved for 1–2 h and incubated at 1% O2 or treated with 100 μM CoCl2 for 5h. After this,
cells were lysed, collected and assayed using a Luciferase Reporter Assay Kit (Promega)
according to the included protocol.
Viability Assays

Author Manuscript

MDAMB-231 cells were transfected with control, βarr1 or βarr2 siRNA and 48h after
transfection were split into 24-well dishes. Cells were incubated at 1% O2 or treated with
100 μM CoCl2, after which the ATP content was measured with CellTiter-Glo®
luminescent cell viability assay kit (Promega) according to the included protocol.
In Vivo measurements

Author Manuscript

Adult female nude mice used in the animal studies were purchased from Charles River. All
animal experiments complied with Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee guidelines. 1 × 106 MDAMB-231-luciferase cells or 50,000 4T1-luciferase cells
were used per tail vein injection. A highly sensitive cooled CCD camera mounted in a lighttight box (IVIS; Xenogen), was used to perform bioluminescent imaging on animals that
were anesthetized with 1–3% isoflurane. The acquisition and analysis software Living
Image® (Xenogen) controlled Imaging and quantification of signals. Prior to imaging each
animal was injected with D-luciferin at 100 mg/kg i.p. Light emitted from the
bioluminescent tumors cells was detected by the IVIS camera system, integrated, digitized,
and displayed. Regions of interest (ROI) from displayed images were marked surrounding
regions with luminescence and quantified as total photons/s using Living Image® software
(Xenogen). Since the imaging was noninvasive, the same animals were analyzed for tumor
growth up to 30–35 days after which animals had to be euthanized for humane reasons.

A) Indicated amounts of cell extracts of MDAMB-231 and HEK-293 cells were analyzed by
Western blotting using the rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-β-arrestin1 (A1CT, top panel)
and anti-β-arrestin2 (A2CT, middle panel) generated against carboxyl terminal domains of
β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2, respectively. The two antibodies have five-fold more affinity
toward the cognate antigen isoform than the other (Kohout et al., 2001). The bottom panel
shows relative amounts of ERK 1 and 2 (as a loading control) in the lysate samples. B)
Indicated amounts of cell extracts of MDAMB-231 and normal breast epithelial cells (Hs
578Bst, ATCC) were immunoblotted for β-arrestins with A1CT antibody (top panel) and
ERK (lower panel). C) Protein bands were quantified from three to four independent
experiments, normalized to protein (μg) input and plotted as bar graphs. ** p < 0.01,

A) Breast carcinoma cells with stable luciferase expression (231-luc) were transfected with
control (targeting no mRNA) or βarr1/2 targeting siRNA and then injected into nude mice
50h later. The spread of luciferase-tagged cells was determined by in vivo bioluminescence
imaging after D-luciferin i.p. injection. The time course of luminescence representing tumor
growth is shown in panel ‘A’. One representative mouse each from ‘control cells’ group and
‘βarrestin-depleted cells’ group are shown for the indicated time points. B) Quantification of
luminescence from 14 mice injected with cells transfected with control siRNA-cells versus
14 mice that received cells depleted of β-arrestins using the Living Image acquisition and

respective aliquots of control and βarr1/2-depleted cells that were used for injections, as
assayed with a luminometer. D) Western blot analyses of lysates of respective samples of
injected cells. The top bands are nonspecific bands, which also serve as loading controls. E)
For survival rate, mice (n = 7 for control and n = 8 for β-arrestin1-depleted) were injected
with 4T1 cells via tail vein as described above and observed up to 35 days. Mice injected
with cells depleted of β-arrestin1 displayed increased survival (P = 0.0006, Log-rank test)
compared with mice injected with cells expressing normal amounts of β-arrestin1. F) An
aliquot of 4T1 cells transfected with either control or β-arrestin1 siRNA was immunoblotted
with A2CT antibody.
