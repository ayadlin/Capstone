Temozolomide for Recurrent
Intracranial Supratentorial
Platinum-Refractory Ependymoma
Marc C. Chamberlain, MD and Sandra K. Johnston, PhD, RN

BACKGROUND: To the authors’ knowledge, there currently is no standard therapy for platinum-resistant
ependymoma; hence, a need exists for new therapies. In the current study, a retrospective evaluation of
temozolomide (TMZ) in adults with recurrent, supratentorial, platinum-refractory, World Health Organization grade 2 ependymoma was performed, with an objective of determining 6-month progression-free
survival (PFS). METHODS: A total of 25 patients, ages 28 to 63 years, with recurrent ependymoma were
treated. All patients had previously been treated with surgery, radiotherapy, and platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin in 15 patients and carboplatin in 10 patients). Nine patients underwent repeat surgery.
Patients were treated at the time of second recurrence with TMZ (5 consecutive days), once every 4 weeks,
which was defined as a single cycle. Neurologic evaluation was performed every 4 weeks and neuroradiographic assessment every 8 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 68 cycles of TMZ (median, 2 cycles; range,
1-6 cycles) was administered. TMZ-related toxicity included leukopenia (7 patients; 1 with grade 3 [grade
was determine according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 3.0]), constipation
(6 patients; none with grade 3), fatigue (5 patients; none with grade 3), anemia (2; none with grade 3),
thrombocytopenia (2; none with grade 3), and deep vein thrombosis (2; none with grade 3). One patient
(4%) demonstrated a partial radiographic response, 9 (36%) had stable disease, and 15 (60%) developed
progressive disease after 2 cycles of TMZ. Time to tumor progression ranged from 1 to 7 months (median,
2 months). Survival ranged from 2 to 8 months (median, 3 months). The 6-month and 12-month PFS were
2% and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: TMZ in this dose schedule demonstrated little efficacy in a cohort

Ependymomas are tumors that arise from the ependymal cells of the cerebral ventricles, the central canal of the spinal cord, and cortical rests.1-10 Although uncommon, ependymomas constitute 8% to
10% of brain tumors in children and 1% to 3% of brain tumors in adults. Approximately 60% of ependymomas occur in children who are aged <16 years and 25% occur in children aged <4 years.7-10 The
World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors separates ependymomas into subependymomas (WHO grade 1), myxopapillary ependymomas (WHO grade 1), ependymomas (WHO grade 2),

and anaplastic ependymomas (WHO grade 3).1-10 Ependymoblastomas are considered a different type of tumor
and are classified as embryonal primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs).
Optimal management of grades 2 and 3 ependymomas includes surgical resection and evaluation of the
extent of central nervous system involvement using both
cerebrospinal fluid cytology and craniospinal contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).1-19 Subsequent treatment depends on the extent of residual disease
as defined by postoperative MRI. In instances of measurable residual disease, reoperation should be considered
because the survival of patients with ependymomas is significantly improved by the performance of a complete surgical resection. In patients not considered for further
surgery and with residual disease, limited-field radiotherapy is usually administered. The role of craniospinal irradiation in patients with local disease and no evidence of
metastasis is controversial, because the majority of tumor
recurrences are local and occur at the site of the primary
tumor.1-22 To the best of our knowledge, no clear role for
adjuvant chemotherapy has been demonstrated to
date.5,8,23-28 When administered, chemotherapy for
ependymomas has been administered primarily to children aged <3 years as adjuvant therapy and to patients
with recurrent disease who are not considered surgical or
irradiation candidates for salvage therapy.5,8,23-28
Recurrent ependymomas are managed by reoperation of tumors that are surgically accessible, by radiotherapy if not previously administered, and by salvage
chemotherapy.5,8,23-32 The role of stereotactic radiotherapy is evolving and is increasingly used for recurrent
ependymoma after either reoperation or as a stand-alone
therapy.33,34 Because salvage chemotherapy is not curative, no standard therapy exists and a variety of chemotherapy agents and drug schedules have been investigated.
The primary objective of this retrospective analysis
was to observe whether temozolomide (TMZ) as a single
agent given every 4 weeks could significantly delay disease
progression in adult patients with neuroradiographically
recurrent, intracranial, WHO grade 2 ependymomas as
determined by 6-month progression-free survival (PFS).
Twenty-five adult patients with recurrent, supratentorial,
WHO grade 2 ependymomas who were previously treated
with surgery, radiotherapy, and platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) were evaluated retrospectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The retrospective analysis was performed at the University
of Southern California, Norris Cancer Center, and the
University of South Florida H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center
and Research Institute. The study analysis commenced in
January 2000 and closed in July 2008. The retrospective
analysis was conducted without industry support, and approval and funding for the off-label use of TMZ was
obtained from the patients’ insurance carrier. Patients
were apprised of the nonstandard of care treatment and
agreed to TMZ treatment after disclosure of potential
risks and benefits.
Objectives and Endpoints
The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of
TMZ in the treatment of patients with platinum-refractory, recurrent, supratentorial ependymoma. The primary
endpoint was 6-month PFS. Secondary endpoints
included overall survival (OS), time to disease progression, and response. Toxicity was evaluated in all eligible
patients receiving at least 1 cycle of TMZ.
Eligibility
Patients had a histologically proven WHO grade 2, intracranial, supratentorial ependymoma that was determined
to be recurrent neuroradiographically. Patients must have
developed disease progression after definitive radiotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin). Patients could not have received >1 salvage
chemotherapy regimen. Patients could not have received
prior TMZ therapy. Patients were required to have radiographically measurable intracranial disease. Adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic functions were required
before the administration of TMZ.
All patients were aware of the neoplastic nature of
their disease and agreed to treatment after being informed
of the procedures to be used, experimental nature of the
therapy, alternatives, potential benefits, side effects, risk,
and discomforts.
Drug Schedule
TMZ was administered to all patients at a dose of 150 to
200 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days regardless of

antiepileptic drug. TMZ was administered orally and at
night. Concurrent dexamethasone was permitted for the
control of neurologic signs and symptoms. TMZ was
administered with oral antiemetic premedication (ondansetron or granisetron). Post-TMZ antiemetics were permitted on an as-needed basis.
A cycle of therapy was operationally defined as 28
days, during which TMZ was administered on Days 1 to
5. Treatment with TMZ was repeated every 28 days from
Day 1 provided that all hematologic toxicity from the previous cycle had resolved to grade 2, and all nonhematologic toxicity had recovered to grade 1. If recovery had
not occurred by Day 28, the subsequent cycle of TMZ
was delayed until these criteria were met. All toxicities
were rated according to the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0).
Only a single TMZ dose escalation was permitted
(from the starting TMZ dose of 150 mg/m2/day to 200
mg/m2/day). Dose reduction for toxicity was by 25% in
patients with grade 3 toxicity and only 1 dose reduction
was allowed. Patients having a grade 3 toxicity of any type
after 1 dose reduction discontinued TMZ as did patients
delayed >2 weeks from the next scheduled chemotherapy.
Methods of Evaluation
Laboratory tests (complete blood counts and metabolic
panel) were obtained before the start of TMZ therapy and
at Day 21 of each cycle. Neurologic examination was performed every 4 weeks, and contrast-enhanced cranial
MRI was performed every 8 weeks after 2 cycles of TMZ.
Neuroradiographic response criteria as defined by
Macdonald et al were used.35 In patients with stable disease or those who achieved a partial or complete response,
2 additional cycles of TMZ were to be administered, after
which patients were assessed again as described. Patients
were continued on TMZ therapy until the documentation
of progressive disease, at which time patients were
removed from TMZ and were either monitored or offered
alternative therapy.
PFS and OS were defined as the time from the first
day of treatment with TMZ until disease progression or
death. Patients were removed from TMZ treatment if
there was progressive disease, the development of unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal, or noncompliance with
treatment requirements.

Design
The primary objective of this retrospective analysis was to
determine whether TMZ could delay disease progression
in adult patients with recurrent supratentorial ependymoma. The median survival and time to disease progression, and the associated 95% confidence intervals (95%
CIs) were computed. Kaplan-Meier plots were constructed to display the estimated probabilities of OS and
time to disease progression.

RESULTS
Patient Populations
Twenty-five (15 men and 10 women) patients ages 28 to 63
years (median, 49 years) with recurrent, intracranial, supratentorial, WHO grade 2 ependymoma (original pathology
was reviewed and confirmed in all cases by the participating
institutions) were treated with TMZ (Table 1). Recurrent
ependymoma was defined by objective neuroradiographic
disease progression (>25% increase in tumor size) compared with prior baseline neuroradiographic images using
the criteria reported by Macdonald et al.35 All neuroradiography was locally reviewed by 2 neuroradiologists blinded to
treatment and by the participating neuro-oncologist
(M.C.C.). All patients underwent cranial MRI, demonstrating progressive disease within 2 weeks of TMZ administration. Nine patients (36%) underwent a reoperation
(subtotal resection in 3 patients) in which repeat tumor histology was consistent with WHO grade 2 ependymoma.
Notwithstanding reoperation, residual disease was measurable (median tumor volume, 2 cm3) in all patients. The 6
patients with a complete re-resection subsequently developed
disease progression and had radiographically measurable
disease.
Patients presented at the time of tumor recurrence
with the following signs and symptoms: increased intracranial pressure as manifested by increasing headache
(n ¼ 14), worsening seizures (n ¼ 8), altered mental status
(n ¼ 4), progressive hemiparesis (n ¼ 4), new onset
homonymous hemianopsia (n ¼ 2), and gait ataxia (n ¼ 1)
Patient performance status using the Karnofsky scale
ranged from 60 to 100 (median, 80) at the time of documented tumor recurrence and the initiation of TMZ therapy. Tumor locations are delineated in Tables 1 and 2.

Prior treatment is shown in Tables 1 and 2. All
patients had previously been treated with upfront limitedfield radiotherapy using conventional fractionated radiotherapy in which 1.8 to 2.0 grays (Gy) was administered
daily, with a median tumor dose of 54 Gy (range, 50 Gy54 Gy). Twelve patients (48%) were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy at the time of first disease recurrence.

All patients were treated with TMZ after failure of
platinum-based therapy (Tables 1 and 2) as demonstrated
by neuroradiographic disease progression (in all patients)
or clinical disease progression (60% of patients). All
patients began TMZ at the time of the third disease recurrence (after initial surgery and radiotherapy, reoperation,
or stereotactic radiotherapy at the time of first recurrence
and platinum-based chemotherapy at the time of second
recurrence), with a median time to the initiation of TMZ
after initial surgery of 46 months (range, 18-111 months).
A total of 68 cycles of TMZ were administered. A minimum of 1 cycle of TMZ was administered to each patient
with a median of 2 cycles (range, 1-6 cycles). TMZ was
administered at the prescribed dose in all patients. No
other antiglioma agents aside from dexamethasone were
used. Oral dexamethasone was used concurrently in
12 patients and was increased in 6 patients with clinical
disease progression. The dose of dexamethasone was
decreased in 3 patients with a neuroradiographic response
and as patient clinical status permitted.
No patients received further chemotherapy after disease progression occurred while they were receiving
TMZ, and all progressed rapidly (median survival of 3
months after the initiation of TMZ) and died of complications of their primary brain tumor.

Toxicity
Toxicity was recorded for all grades for all patients by type
using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0).
A total of 68 TMZ treatment cycles were administered.
The following TMZ-related toxicities were recorded:
leukopenia (7 patients; 1 with grade 3), constipation
(6 patients; none with grade 3), fatigue (5 patients; none
with grade 3), anemia (2; none with grade 3), thrombocytopenia (2; none with grade 3), and deep vein thrombosis
(2; none with grade 3). There were no treatment-related
transfusions, episodes of febrile neutropenia, or treatment-related deaths.

Response
All patients were assessable for response and survival. After
1 to 2 cycles of TMZ, 15 patients (60%) demonstrated
progressive disease and discontinued therapy. Seven
patients (28%) received 4 cycles of therapy. At the

conclusion of TMZ, the Karnofsky performance status
ranged from 40 to 70, with a median of 60 in the
entire group. Patients who failed to respond to TMZ
were offered alternative or supportive therapy. Survival in
the entire cohort ranged from 2 to 8 months, with a median of 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.56months-3.44 months)
(Fig. 1). The probability of survival at 6 months and 12
months was 2% and 0%, respectively. All patients had
died at the time of last follow-up, and all deaths were
directly attributable to the effects of progressive intracranial tumor.
No patients demonstrated a complete response,
1 patient (4%) achieved a neuroradiographic partial
response (95% CI, <1%-21%), and 9 patients (36%)
demonstrated stable disease (95% CI, 20%-56%). In
patients with a neuroradiographic response or stable disease (10; 40%), the median time to tumor progression
was 5.5 months (range, 4 months-8 months) (95% CI,
3.8 months-6.24 months). The dose of dexamethasone
was able to be reduced in 3 patients (12%), and in
1 patient (4%), dexamethasone was discontinued.
There was no association observed between response
to TMZ and response to the prior platinum-based regimens. In addition, no difference was noted with regard to
the pretreatment tumor volume in patients with either a
partial response to TMZ or stable disease compared with
patients with progressive disease.

To our knowledge, the management of recurrent ependymoma has not received much attention in the literature,
despite the factthat the disease will recur in the majority of
patients. Because recurrent ependymoma is difficult to
manage, and multiple recurrences after intervention with
further surgery or chemotherapy are common, Stafford
et al treated 12 patients (with a total of 17 tumors) with
stereotactic radiosurgery.34 Of the 12 patients, 11 had
previously been treated with external beam radiotherapy
and all patients had undergone previous resection. The
median marginal tumor dose was 18 Gy (range, 12 Gy24 Gy). The median OS was 3.4 years (range, 1.4 years-5
years) with 2 in-field, 1 marginal, and 2 distant failures.
Two patients developed treatment-related complications
after radiosurgery. These results appear superior to salvage
chemotherapy, and indicate that this modality of therapy
may offer the best palliation in patients with recurrent
ependymoma not otherwise considered for reoperation. A
similar approach was taken in the management of this
cohort of adult patients with recurrent ependymoma as
reflected by re-resection being performed in 36% and the
administration of stereotactic radiotherapy in 48% of
patients.
To the best of our knowledge, the literature regarding
treatment with chemotherapy for recurrent ependymoma
is meager and is comprised of studies in both children and
adults. Goldwein et al reported on 36 patients with recurrent intracranial ependymoma, in which 33 were treated
with reoperation, 12 received stereotactic radiotherapy,
and all received chemotherapy.7 The median time to disease recurrence was 2.8 years, and in the majority, recurrence was either local (78%) or local with concomitant
distant metastasis (14%). Twenty-nine (80%) of the initial
cohort developed a second disease recurrence, in which a
local component to the recurrence was observed in 80%.
The 2-year OS and PFS rates were 29% and 23%, respectively. Considering only first recurrence, the 2-year actuarial survival was 39% and the median survival was 17
months. The median PFS was 12 months. Among 36
evaluable patients and 37 chemotherapy regimens, there
was 1 partial response (3%), 7 stable disease patterns
(20%), and 29 cases of disease progression (80%). In
patients with responding or stable disease, the median duration of response was 9 months (range, 3 months-23
months). Cisplatin was believed to be the most active agent

among the 4 commonly used chemotherapeutics (cisplatin,
procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine).
In a single-institution retrospective review by Chiu
et al, 12 children with recurrent ependymoma were
treated with a variety of chemotherapy regimens, including procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV regimen) and mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone, and
procarbazine (MOPP regimen).4 All but 2 patients developed disease progression in <6 months. Two long-term
responding children were described; in both patients, the
PCV regimen was administered and was associated with a
neuroradiographic partial response.
In a phase 2 study of daily oral etoposide in children
with recurrent brain tumors, Needle et al reported that, of
5 children with ependymoma who were treated with etoposide, there was 1 complete response, 1 partial response,
2 stable disease patterns, and 1 case of disease progression.27 In a similar study, Chamberlain reported on
12 patients with recurrent ependymoma treated with
chronic oral etoposide.29 Two patients demonstrated a radiographic response (both partial), and 4 demonstrated
stable disease for a median duration of response of
7 months.
In what to our knowledge is the largest study of
dose-intensive chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation performed to date, Grill et al reported
on 16 patients using a regimen of high-dose busulfan and
cyclophosphamide.23 Toxicity, mainly gastrointestinal
and cutaneous, was severe and resulted in 1 toxicityrelated death. Of the 15 patients evaluated, there were no
radiographic responses and 10 (66%) patients had a stable
disease pattern. The median duration of stable disease was
7 months (range, 5 months-8 months).
In a study from the Children’s Cancer Group,
Mason et al treated 15 children with recurrent ependymoma with dose-intensive chemotherapy (thio-TEPA,
etoposide, and carboplatin) followed by autologous bone
marrow transplantation.29 Five children died of treatment-related complications, 8 children died of progressive
disease (median survival after transplant, 6 months), and
1 child died of unrelated causes. Only a single child
remained alive and without tumor progression at the time
of last follow-up.
Brandes et al retrospectively evaluated 28 adult
patients with recurrent ependymoma who were treated
with either a platinum-based or nitrosourea-based

regimen.30 They reported higher response rates with platinum-based therapies (30% vs 13%) but no difference
with respect to PFS (median, 10 months). Gornet et al, in
a small series of 16 patients, also compared platinumbased with nitrosourea-based chemotherapy for recurrent
ependymoma and reached similar conclusions.31 Lastly,
in a phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy of TMZ in recurrent pediatric brain tumors by the Children’s Oncology
Group, 14 patients with recurrent ependymoma were enrolled (12 of whom were evaluable), in whom no responders were noted.32 Five patients manifested stable disease as
their best response, but all developed disease progression
within 6 months.
These studies indicate that chemotherapy has a very
modest effect in the setting of recurrent disease and that no
chemotherapy regimen has clear superiority over another,
albeit there is a trend toward higher response rates in
patients treated with platinum-based regimens. In addition,
dose-intensive chemotherapy offers no advantages over conventional-dose chemotherapy in the treatment of recurrent
intracranial ependymomas. This small retrospective analysis
of adults with recurrent supratentorial ependymoma suggests that, in patients previously treated with platinumbased chemotherapy, further therapy with TMZ used in
the standard dose schedule provides very little efficacy. Alternative schedules of TMZ or its administration before
platinum-based chemotherapies may be more efficacious in
patients with recurrent ependymoma and warrant further
study. Targeted therapy, directed at presumed ependymoma cancer stem cells or at overexpressed epidermal
growth factor receptor, represents a novel and alternative
noncytotoxic therapy for recurrent ependymoma that to
our knowledge remains as yet untested.36
