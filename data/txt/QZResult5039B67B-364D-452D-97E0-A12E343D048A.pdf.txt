ABSTRACT
In study, the expression patterns and functional differences between an original
glioma cell population (U251 and U87) and sublines (U251-P10, U87-P10) that were
selected to be migration-prone were investigated. The expressions levels of VEGF
and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were increased in the migrationprone sublines as well as in samples from patients with high-grade glioma when
compared to those with low-grade glioma. In addition, cells of the migration-prone
sublines showed increased expression of the oncogenic microRNA. miR-21, which was
also associated with more advanced clinical pathological stages in the patient tissue
specimens. Treatment of U251 cells with an miR-21 mimic dramatically enhanced the
migratory activity and expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. Furthermore, treatment
with curcumin decreased the miR-21 level and anti-apoptotic protein expression,
and increased the expression of pro-apoptosis proteins and microtubule-associated
protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II) in U251 cells. The migration-prone sublines showed
decreased induction of cell death markers in response to curcumin treatment. Finally,
U251-P10 cells showed resistance against curcumin treatment. These results suggest
that miR-21 is associated with regulation of the migratory ability and survival in
human glioma cells. These findings suggest novel mechanisms of malignancy and new
potential combinatorial strategies for the management of malignant glioma.

INTRODUCTION

3]; this property is geneally referred to as intratumoral
heterogeneity. The cancer stem cell hypothesis is a
prevailing model to explain intratumoral heterogeneity [4,
5]. Indeed, most human cancers contain distinct cellular
subpopulations with different genetic alterations and
behaviors [6]. Several studies have combined genetic
and molecular approaches to evaluate the phenotypic

Human tumors tend to contain a variety of cellular
subpopulations with different characteristics and
behaviors with respect to cellular activities involved
in gene expression, morphology changes, metabolism,
proliferation, drug responsiveness, and motility [1www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

differences between different grades of glioma [7]. For
example, Cheng et al. [8] checked for the presence of
cell subpopulations among U251 and U87 glioma cell
by using a reproducible method for investigating the
invasive behavior of cells. The use of a three-demensional
experimental model for detecting changes in proliferation
markers reflecting heterogeneity in glioma is a valuable
approach toward drug development. The subpopulations
identified in glioma showed differences with respect to
their sensitivity toward chemotherapy agents, which was
also observed by Shapiro et al. [9]. Furthermore, Xu et
al. [10] pointed out that development of cell resistance
to bevacizumab anti-angiogenic therapy might be due
to upregulation of angiogenic pathways or genomic
constitution changes. In our current study, we selected
U251 sublines and investigated the heterogeneity of these
different cell lines in the resulting tumor with respect
to control of cell motility and survival. The property of
intratumoral heterogeneity has long been associated with
tumor metastatic potential and therapeutic resistance
[11]. Indeed, the intratumoral heterogeneity of malignant
glioma has been reported to be responsible for the high
frequency of therapeutic failure [12, 13]. These findings
indicate that it is important to understand the heterogeneity
of glioma in order to develop more effective treatment
strategies.
Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small
non-coding RNAs of 20-25 nucleotides that target
the 3′-untranslated region of target mRNAs to induce
translational silencing and negatively regulate protein
expression. MiRNAs play pivotal roles in a wide range
of biological processes such as proliferation, apoptosis,
metabolism, development, and differentiation [14].
MiRNA expression profiling in human cancers has
revealed signatures that are closely associated with
the diagnosis, staging, progression, prognosis, and
responsiveness to therapies [15]. In particular, miR-21
has been shown to be overexpressed in several tumors,
including glioma and breast cancer [16, 17]. miR-21 has
been reported to regulate cellular contractility and the
extracellular matrix composition, so that its overexpression
leads to enhanced cell invasion and metastasis [18]. In
addition, previous clinical studies demonstrated that
increased miR-21 expression was positively associated
with more advanced stages and poorer survival in kidney
and colon cancer patients [19, 20], whereas treatment
of antisense miR-21 to prostate cancer cells resulted in
increased sensitivity to apoptosis and inhibition of cell
invasion [21].
Curcumin, a phyto-polyphenolic pigment derived
from turmeric (Curcuma longa), has been suggested as
a potential anti-cancer agent for many tumor types [22].
It has been used to suppresses inflammation, induces
apoptosis, reduces invasion and angiogenesis, and
sensitizes tumor cells to therapeutic agents. Curcumin has
been shown to inhibit tumor progression by modulating
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a large number of molecules and signal transduction
pathways [23, 24]. A recent report showed that
downregulation of miR-21 was linked to the anticancer
functions of curcumin, and that restoring miR-21
expression antagonized curcumin-induced apoptosis [25].
Previous studies demonstrated that treating malignant
glioblastoma cells with curcumin altered the expression
of Bcl-2, pro-caspase-3, and pro-caspase-9, as well as the
apoptosis pathway [26].
Mechanism by which miRNAs can regulate
apoptosis is through the activation of caspases and death
receptor (DR) signal transductions [27]. DR4 and DR5
induce apoptosis upon binding to their ligand, tumor
necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL).
miR-21 was shown to inhibit TRAIL-dependent apoptosis
by suppressing the expression of caspase-3 in glioma cells
[28]. Moreover, suppression of miR-21 was shown to be
involved in the Smoothened inhibitor-induced activation
of DR4 or DR5, subsequently induces apoptosis, and
reduced cell viability in glioblastoma [29].
In this study, we evaluated differences between
parental glioma cells and selected migration-prone subline
cells with respect to migration abilities, oncogenic miR-21
expression, and cytotoxic sensitivities. In particular, miR21 was upregulated in migration-prone subline cells, and
was found to regulate the expression of the Bcl-2 family
and apoptosis-related proteins. Thus, understanding the
role of miRNAs in regulating intratumoral heterogeneity
will provide novel insights into the molecular basis of
cancers, and might help to identify new biomarkers for
cancer diagnosis and therapy.

RESULTS
The migration-prone sublines and parental cells
exhibited differential migratory abilities and
protein expression profiles
The migration-prone subline cells were selected
from two different glioma cell lines, U251 and U87,
and designated as U251-P10 and U87-P10, respectively.
The migratory activities of U251, U87, U251-P10, and
U87-P10 cells were examined using wound-healing and
transmigratory assays. In the wound-healing model, the
U251-P10 and U87-P10cells exhibited enhanced healing
ability compared with U251 and U87 cells (Figure 1A).
As shown in Figure 1B, U251-P10 and U87-P10 cells
also showed increased cell mobility and migrated more
easily through the membrane pores of cell culture inserts
compared with U251 and U87 cells, respectively. The
mobility of the cells of migration-prone sublines was
approximately 3.2- and 3.5-fold higher than that of U251
and U87 cells, respectively. Protein analysis showed
that the expression levels of two invasive-associated

molecules, VEGF and intracellular cell adhesion molecule
1 (ICAM-1), were higher in U251-P10 cells than in U251
cells (Figure 1C). We further investigated the VEGF and
ICAM-1 mRNA expression levels from samples of patients
with low-grade and high-grade glioma. Real-time PCR
showed a significantly higher level of VEGF mRNA in the
high-grade samples compared with the-low grade samples
(Figure 1D). In addition, a higher level of ICAM-1 mRNA
expression was also observed in glioma samples classified
as high grade (Figure 1E). Our data indicated that upregulation of VEGF and ICAM-1 is associated with the
pathological features of gliomas migration. Thus, elevated
expression of VEGF and ICAM-1 in migration-prone cells
may be involved in the autocrine or paracrine functions
that subsequently enhance migration.

miR-21 has been reported to be highly expressed
in malignant tumors and to play a role in the regulation
of cell migration. Therefore, we compared the miRNA
and protein expression profiles between migrationprone subline cells and parental cells. For both U251
and U87 cells, the migration-prone subline cells showed
higher expression levels of oncogenic miR-21 than the
parental cells (Figure 2A). This same difference in miR21 expression was also observed between low-grade and
high-grade human glioma samples, in which miR-21
expression was significantly elevated in the high-grade
glioma samples (Figure 2B). We further investigated
the involvement of miR-21 in cell motility. As shown in
Figure 3A, the U251 cells demonstrated a 2.5-fold increase
in migration activity after being transfected with miR-21
mimic. Furthermore, transfection with an miR-21 inhibitor

attenuated the migration activity of the migration-prone
U251-P10 cells (Figure 3B). These data demonstrated
a correlation between cell motility and oncogenic miR21 expression. Moreover, the protein expression levels
of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, pro-caspase-9, and pro-caspase-3
were upregulated in U251-P10 cells compared to U251
cells (Supplementary Figure 1). We then assessed the
correlation of the expression of these proteins with miR21 expression. U251 cells were transfected with either a
miRNA negative control or miR-21 mimic. The expression
levels of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, BclxL, pro-caspase-9, and pro-caspase-3 were upregulated
after transfection with the miR-21 mimic in U251 cells
(Figure 3C). Collectively, these results, combined with the
elevated miR-21 expression in migration-prone subline
cells and high-grade human glioma samples, indicated that
miR-21 may play an important role in cancer progression.

miRNAs are important molecules in cancer
initiation and progression. As described above, the
heterogeneity between U251 and U251-P10 cells could be
attirbuted to differential expression of oncogenic miR-21.
Therefore, we next examined the effect of the anti-cancer
drug curcumin on miR-21 expression in these cell lines.
The expression of miR-21 was down-regulated in cells
treated with curcumin (Figure 4A). As shown in Figure
4B, curcumin treatment to U251 cells also resulted in
reduced expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, pro-caspase-9, and
pro-caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely,

and caspase-3 proteins were up-regulated after curcumin
treatment, indicating that curcumin induces a pro-apoptosis
pathway (Figure 4C). Furthermore, the protein expression
levels of Bcl-2, pro-caspase-9, and pro-caspase-3 were all
increased in U251-P10 cells when compared with U251
cells (Figure 4D), and this difference was maintained even
in the presence of 20 µM or 40 µM curcumin (note the
asterisk in Lane). In addition, U251-P10 cells showed
reduced expression of LC3-II and the cleaved forms of
PARP and caspase-3 after treatment with curcumin. These
findings suggest that cells of the migration-prone subline
U251-P10 had lower sensitivity to curcumin-induced cell
death than U251 cells.

tissues [30]. Dysregulated miR-21 expression was
observed in glioblastoma samples and tumor-associated
blood vessels compared with non-neoplastic brain tissue
[14, 31]. Furthermore, clinical reports revealed that
elevated miR-21 expression correlated with tumor grade
and was associated with poorer overall survival in glioma
patients [32]. Moreover, miR-21 was demonstrated to
act as a key regulator of multiple pathways that mediate
cancer cell proliferation [33] and survival [34]. For
example, miR-21 overexpression contributes to the
reduced expression of apoptosis-related genes [35]. In
this study, we demonstrated that miR-21 expression is
correlated with the migration abilities as well as cytotoxic
sensitivities of glioma cells. These results indicate the
potential value of miR-21 as a biomarker for therapy
and a prognostic factor for glioma patients, which may
contribute to improved assessment of survival probability
and treatments. Thus, our study on the functional
difference of gliomas provides a new perspective for the
development of prognostic biomarkers to anticipate cancer
progression. Furthermore, the correlation between miR21 expression and cell motility mediatingcould provide
insight into the association of diverse protein expression
profiles with different clinicopathological parameters in
gliomas.
The present study indicates that curcumin
sensitizes glioma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis
through activating both the extrinsic and intrinsic
apoptosis pathways. Accumulating evidence suggests that
knockdown of miR-21 triggers caspase activation, leading
to increased cell death and inhibition of tumor cell growth
by modulating the expression of apoptosis-associated
proteins [36, 37]. It is believed that the heterogeneity of
a tumor might contribute to its ability to overcome the
host defense response against invasion and metastasis,
leading to the development of resistance to anticancer
drugs [38]. A previous report showed that inhibition of
miR-21 expression decreased matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP) activities, which reduced the motility and invasion
of glioma cells [39]. MiR-21 is also known to contribute
to glioma’s resistance to chemotherapy by targeting
tumor suppressor genes such as FBXO11 and PDCD4
[40-42]. Several studies have documented a role for miR21 in protecting glioma cells from chemotherapy drugs
via regulation of Bcl-2 and caspase-3 activity [43, 44].
For example, Cheng et al. [8] evaluated the differences
between spheroids generated from two different cell lines
in terms of their proliferative activities and the caspase
expression. Subpopulations of cells existing in the
spheroid cores were identified, which appeared to have a
survival advantage in response to treatment. This suggests
that high levels of miR-21 and anti-apoptosis proteins are
important factors for the regulation of chemosensitivity
in glioma.
A few studies have investigated the prognostic
value of DR4 and DR5 expression levels in other tumor

Migration-prone subline cells exhibited lower
cytotoxic sensitivities to curcumin-induced cell
death through DR
We next evaluated the responses of U251 and
U251-P10 cells to induction of extrinsic cell death signals.
As shown in Figure 5A, flow cytometry revealed that
the expression of both DR4 and DR5 was enhanced by
curcumin treatment in a dose-dependent manner in U251
cells. In addition, curcumin induced the expression of DR4
and DR5 to a greater extent in U251 than in U251-P10
cells, leading to an increased ratio of U251:U251-P10
cells (Figure 5B). The activation of DR pathways plays
a critical role in a variety of drug-induced apoptotic cell
death pathways. Therefore, we further studied whether
the variation in curcumin induced cell death rates
between U251 and U251-P10 cells might be attributed to
differences in the activation of DR pathways. As shown
in Figure 5C, curcumin treatment reduced cell viability in
both U251 and U251-P10 cells. Interestingly, curcumin
was more cytotoxic to U251 cells than to U251-P10 cells,
as determined with MTT assays. Moreover, U251 cells
that were pretreated with TRAIL showed significantly
elevated curcumin-induced cell death, whereas this
augmentation of curcumin-induced cell death was not
statistically significant in U251-P10 cells (Figure 5C).
These results, along with the data shown in Figure 4,
indicated differences between U251 and U251-P10 subline
cells with respect to the response to the induction of cell
death in both the intrinsic pathway and extrinsic pathway.
In addition, the DR expression level differed among
various grades of malignant human glioma specimens. As
shown in Figure 5D, DR expression showed an increased
tendency in human glioma tissue specimens at more
advanced grades (i.e., grades III and IV).

DISCUSSION
Previous studies have shown that miR-21 expression
is higher in malignant cells and tumor microenvironment
components compared with those of adjacent non-tumor

types [45, 46]. The DR5 expression level decreased as
clinical staging progressed in patients with laryngeal
squamous cell carcinoma, but an increase in DR5
expression was associated with advanced clinical stage
in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma [47]. Stronger
DR5 tumor staining was associated with an adverse
prognosis in non-small-cell lung cancer [48] and breast
cancer [49]. Malignant glioma cells have been found to
mainly express DR5, and an inverse relationship between
the DR4 mRNA expression level and WHO grade has
been reported in various astrocytic tumors [50]. Indeed,
Jos et al. [50] stated that DR4 and DR5 expression in
cell lines cannot accurately reflect the heterogeneous
phenotype of primary GBM tissue. Rieger et al. [51]
reported that induced DR expression may be a response
of the defense system of glioma cells to mediate tumor
immune escape. However, DR expression may also
have a decisive role in determining TRAIL-induced DRmediated apoptotic signaling [52, 53]. In this study, we
showed that human glioma cells express DR4 and DR5
proteins (Supplementary Figure 2A) and that malignant
human glioma specimens express DR5 (Figure 5D).
Moreover, clinical studies determined that treatment
with conatumumab (an anti-DR5 agent) in breast cancer
patients could be considered safe [54], and improved
the survival rate in phase II studies of colorectal cancer
patients [55]. Therefore, these profiles of DRs and
their ligands could be important for predicting the

responsiveness of malignant gliomas to treatment with
TRAIL and chemotherapy drugs in future clinical trials.
Tumor cell migration is essential for invasion and
dissemination into surrounding tissues. Growth factors
and other chemotactic agents can mediate cell migration
and proliferation during tumorigenesis. We previously
established a cancer cell model with high migratory ability,
and revealed that the migration-prone sublines showed
both higher migration and invasion activity [56, 57]. We
found more prominent expression of glial cell line-derived
neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in migration-prone cells,
which also showed higher levels of MMP-13 expression
[58]. In the current study, we further confirmed that after
10 rounds of selection, the migration-prone U251-P10
cells expressed higher levels of MMP-13 (Supplementary
Figure 2B). We also previously performed in vivo glioma
xenograft experiments, and demonstrated that U251 cells
inoculated in the brains of nude mice grew as noninvasive
solid tumor masses (ball-like) with negligible localized
invasion and a small tumor size. In contrast, the cells of
the migration-prone subline U251-P10 grew in the mouse
brains with a diffuse tumor boundary and fingerlike
protrusions [57]. Thus, the present in vitro experiments
confirmed these in vivo findings, suggesting that
migration-prone subline cells show increased migratory
activity compared with parental cells.
In summary, this study identified functional
differences between migration-prone subline cells and

parental cells. miR-21 expression was upregulated in both
the migration-prone cells as well as in samples from highgrade glioma patients. Furthermore, the expression levels
of the migration-related molecules VEGF and ICAM1 were also increased in malignant gliomas. Enforced
expression of miR-21 in parental cells via transfection
with an miR-21 mimic restored the expression of the
anti-apoptotic proteins pro-caspase-9 and pro-caspase-3.
Taken together, these findings demonstrate that altering
the expression of oncogenic miR-21 and migration- and
apoptosis-related proteins could restore curcumin-induced
cell death. These observations suggest that the extent of
intratumoral heterogeneity in glioma influences cell
migratory activity as well as the expression of intrinsic
and extrinsic apoptotic proteins. Therefore, altering the
migratory activity and regulating the levels of intratumoral
heterogeneity might be a potential strategy for treating
glioma. Further functional studies on potential molecular
markers may provide novel therapeutic strategies for
specifically targeting cellular invasion and metastasis to
effectively treat malignant gliomas.

Memorial Hospital, and all subjects provided informed
written consent before their enrollment. The tumor
tissue specimens were acquired from patients who
had been diagnosed with glioma and had undergone
surgical resection at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.
The pathological grades (on a scale of I to IV) of each
glioma specimen were verified through histological
examination between February 2005 and November 2012
by a neuropathologist according to the World Health
Organization criteria. The tissue samples for miRNA or
mRNA examination were sharply excised, placed in sterile
tubes, and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. The
samples were stored at -80°C until analysis.

Immunohistochemistry
The protocol for immunohistochemistry was
performed as described in our previous report [59].
Briefly, tissue specimens on glass slides were rehydrated
and quenched for endogenous peroxidases with hydrogen
peroxide. After being deparaffinized, the sections were
blocked by incubation in PBS containing 3% bovine
serum albumin. The anti-DR5 primary antibody was
applied to the slides at a dilution of 1:50, followed
by overnight incubation at 4 °C. After several washes
with PBS, the samples were incubated with the biotinconjugated secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:50.
Bound antibodies were detected with the ABC reaction kit
(Vector Laboratories; Burlington, CA, USA), developed
with diaminobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich), and counterstained
with hematoxylin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Primary antibodies specific for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
PARP, pro-caspase-3, pro-caspase-9, and β-actin were
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA). Primary antibodies were also obtained against
cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA, USA), DR4 and DR5 (Imgenex, San Diego, CA,
USA), and LC3-I/II (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO,
USA). Curcumin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO, USA). The miRNA negative control, and miR21 mimics and inhibitors were acquired from Ambion Life
Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Transmigratory assay
A transmigratory activity assay was performed as
described previously [59, 60]. Briefly, cells in serum-free
medium were seeded onto the upper chambers with 8-µm
pore size polycarbonate filters (Corning, NY, USA). The
cells were then incubated for 24 h at 37°C in a humidified
incubator. Non-migrated cells remaining on the upper
surface of the filters were removed by wiping with a
cotton swab. Cells that penetrated through the pores and
migrated to the underside of the filters were stained with
0.05% crystal violet solution containing 20% methanol.
The number of stained cells was counted in three random
fields per well under a light microscope and images of the
migrated cells were acquired with a digital camera.

Cell culture
U251 and U87 human brain glioma cells were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained in 75-cm2 flasks
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM). All
cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin,
and were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2 and 95% air.

for 48 h. MiR-21 mimic, miRNA negative control, or
inhibitor were pre-mixed with LF2000 in OPTI medium
(Invitrogen) for 20 min before application to the cells. An
equal volume of medium containing 10% FBS was added
4−6 h later. After 24 h of incubation, LF2000-containing
media were replaced with fresh serum-free media.

Establishment of the migration-prone sublines
Subpopulations of glioma cells were selected
according to their differential migration ability using the
previously described cell culture insert system [61]. After
24 h of migration, cells that had penetrated through the
pores and migrated to the underside of the filters were
trypsinized, harvested and cultured for 2 days for a second
round of selection. After 10 rounds of selection, the
subline was designated as the migration-prone subline of
U251-P10 or U87-P10 cells.

Flow cytometry
Glioma cells were cultured in six-well plates. Cells
were treated with vehicle or curcumin for 8 h, washed with
PBS, and trypsinized at 37°C. The cells were fixed for 10
min in 4% paraformaldehyde and then rinsed with PBS
followed by incubation with anti-DR4 or -DR5 antibodies
for 1 h. After a brief wash, the cells were incubated
with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary
antibody for 1 h and analyzed by flow cytometry using
FACSCalibur with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was extracted from glioma cells using
TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and
was quantified using the Biodrop spectrophotometer
(Cambridge, UK). The expression levels of miR-21 were
detected using quantitative real time-PCR and the TaqMan
MicroRNA Assay kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA) as described in the manufacturer protocols.
Two micrograms of total RNA from each sample was
reverse-transcribed using the TaqMan MicroRNA
Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). PCR
amplifications were performed in final volumes of 20
μL using TaqMan Universal PCR Master mix. The
amplifications were initiated by incubation at 95°C for 10
min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for
60 s. The expression of U6 RNA was used as an internal
control to normalize the expression levels of miRNAs.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined using an MTT assay.
Cells on a 96-well plate were treated with curcumin for
24 h. The media were removed and the cells were washed
with PBS followed by incubation with MTT (0.5 mg/
mL) for 2 h at 37°C. The MTT reagent was then replaced
with dimethyl sulfoxide (100 μL per well) to dissolve the
formazan crystals. This process was facilitated by mixing
the samples on a shaker at room temperature for 10 min,
and then the absorbance at 550 nm was determined using
a microplate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT).

Statistical analysis

Western blotting

Statistical analysis was performed using the
software Graphpad Prism 4.01 (GraphPad Software
Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The values are presented
as mean ± SEM. The significance levels of differences
between the experimental group and control groups were
assessed using the Student’s t-test. Statistical comparisons
of more than two groups were performed using one-way
analysis of variance with the Bonferroni post-hoc test. The
difference was considered significant if the p-value was <
0.05.

Proteins were extracted from samples as described
previously [62] resolved by electrophoresis, and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The membranes were
incubated for 1 h with 4% dry skim milk in PBS to block
non-specific bindings, followed by incubation overnight
at 4°C with primary antibodies. After three washes in
PBS with Tween-20, the membranes were incubated with
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots
were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using
Kodak X-OMAT LS films (Rochester, NY, USA).
