Abstract
Sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2) may have utility as a prognostic marker in inﬂammatory diseases such as
cancer in which it has been rationalized as a candidate therapeutic target. Here, we show that SK2 has an
oncogenic role in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by inﬂuencing expression of MYC. Genetic ablation
of SK2 impaired leukemia development in a mouse model of ALL and pharmacologic inhibition extended
survival in mouse xenograft models of human disease. SK2 attenuation in both the settings reduced MYC
expression in leukemic cells, with reduced levels of acetylated histone H3 within the MYC gene associated
with reduced levels of MYC protein and expression of MYC-regulated genes. Our results demonstrated
that SK2 regulates MYC, which has a pivotal role in hematologic malignancies, providing a preclinical proof
of concept for this pathway as a broad-based therapeutic target in this setting. Cancer Res; 74(10); 2803–15.

Introduction
Sphingosine kinases (SK) 1 and 2 catalyze the synthesis of
sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) from sphingosine (1). Overexpression of SK1 has indisputable tumor-promoting properties (2) and has been associated with poor survival in patients
with solid tumor (3–5), resistance to imatinib in chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML; refs. 6–8), and to daunorubicin in
acute myeloid leukemia cells (9). In contrast, the role of SK2 in
cancer is less clear. While overexpression suppressed cell
growth and induced apoptosis (1), knockdown of SPHK2 in
glioblastoma cells inhibited proliferation more effectively than
knockdown of SPHK1, and SPHK2-deﬁcient breast cancer cells
proliferated poorly in vivo (5, 10, 11). SK2 has basal activity that
is enhanced by extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)–
mediated phosphorylation (12), placing it downstream of the
signaling pathways frequently activated in malignancies,
including B-Raf, Ras, Jak, and Flt3 (13, 14), all of which can
activate ERK (15).
S1P is best known for its extracellular effects mediated
through G protein–coupled receptors, S1P1 to S1P5. S1P can

also act intracellularly by direct modulation of histone
deacetylase (HDAC) activity and the ubiquitin ligase activity
of tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 2
(TRAF2; ref. 1). In the nucleus, SK2 binds directly to HDACs
where locally produced S1P inhibits HDAC1 and 2, increasing acetylation of histone H3 on Lys9, H4 on Lys5, and H2B on
Lys12 (16). Gene expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 and
transcriptional regulator c-fos is subsequently increased,
providing an explanation for the reported growth-inhibitory
effects of SK2.
The Myc proto-oncogene protein (c-Myc) is overexpressed
across a diverse range of human cancers (17), including
hematologic malignancies, playing a role in both tumor
initiation and maintenance (18). In acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL), the role of c-Myc has not been extensively
explored; however, translocations involving MYC have been
reported in some cases (19, 20). Normally MYC expression is
tightly controlled by transcriptional regulatory motifs in its
proximal promoter region (21); however, epigenetic modiﬁcations can also inﬂuence the expression of MYC, including in ALL (22).
We demonstrate that a gene signature consistent with
increased SK2 activity is present in ALL patient diagnostic
samples and that SK2 protein is overexpressed and activated in
ALL cells. Inhibition of SK2 kills B-lineage ALL cells and
synergizes with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and with
imatinib in Philadelphia chromosome–positive (Phþ) cells in
vitro. SK2 inhibition reduced expression of MYC mRNA, protein, and c-Myc target genes. Reduced association of acetylated
histone H3 with MYC was observed, a ﬁnding consistent with
the effect being mediated by the role of SK2 in histone
acetylation. In vivo, SK2 inhibition showed signiﬁcant antileukemic effects in a human xenograft model of ALL, and
enhanced the efﬁcacy of imatinib, resulting in increased

Generation of gene signatures
Gene signatures were generated using normalized data (GenomeStudio) from cell lines treated with 60 mmol/L (ALL1, TOM1,
and NALM6) or 80 mmol/L (REH) ABC2924640 for 24 hours.
Data were ﬁltered using a differential expression (Diff) P value
of < 0.01 or 2-fold regulation followed by principal component
analysis (Qlucore; P < 0.005; false discovery rate < 0.01). The
validation cohort was generated using 80 mmol/L ABC294640treated 2032, 1345, 2070, 1809, and LK63 cells. Hierarchical
clustering was performed using the GenePattern website and
the Pearson or Spearman correlation for the column distance
measure and Pairwise complete-linkage method, on data normalized for each row and centered on the mean. Heat maps
were generated using Java Treeview. The signal intensity for
genes was extracted from GSE28497. The mean of the log2
-transformed data of the upregulated genes was calculated and
the signature intensity was expressed as the change in this value
in patient samples relative to that in the normal controls.
S1P quantitation and Western blotting
S1P concentrations in mouse plasma and cell lysates were
determined using an S1P ELISA Kit (Echelon Biosciences Inc.)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western blotting
was performed as previously described (24).

Flow cytometry, viability, and proliferation assays
Viability was measured using propidium iodide (PI) and
Annexin V–FITC (BD Biosciences) staining and proliferation
was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation both as previously described (25). Intracellular caspase-3 staining was performed as previously described (26), using FACSCanto or
LSRFortessa ﬂow cytometers (BD Biosciences).
Assessment of drug interactions
Cells were cultured alone or with IC50 concentrations of
agents to be tested when used singly and viability was assessed
by ﬂow cytometry. The proportion of surviving cells expected if
no interactive effects were observed was calculated according
to the method of Webb (27).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Protein was cross-linked to DNA for 10 minutes at 37 C with
1% formaldehyde and then quenched with 125 mmol/L glycine.
Cells were lysed in 1% SDS, 10 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L TrisHCl, pH 8.0 for 10 minutes on ice and sonicated using ﬁve 1minute cycles at 40% amplitude with 60% duty from a Branson
sonicator. Lysates were clariﬁed by centrifugation at 10,000 g
for 10 minutes at 4 C and diluted 10-fold in IP buffer [0.5% NP40; 50 mmol/L Tris, pH 8; 120 mmol/L NaCl; 0.5 mmol/L PMSF;

precleared for 1 hour at 4 C with protein G magnetic beads
(Invitrogen) and then incubated with primary antibody and
protein G magnetic beads overnight at 4 C. Beads were
sequentially washed with IP buffer, high-salt wash buffer (IP
buffer containing 500 mmol/L NaCl), lithium wash buffer (250
mmol/L LiCl; 0.5% NP-40; 1% sodium deoxycholate; 1 mmol/L
EDTA, and 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and Tris/EDTA (10
mmol/L Tris and 1 mmol/L EDTA, pH 8.0). The protein–DNA
complexes were eluted with 1% SDS in 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3 at
room temperature for 15 minutes, cross-links were reversed in
50 mmol/L NaCl at 65 C for 6 hours, and DNA was puriﬁed
using QIAquick PCR columns (Qiagen).
PCR, quantitative PCR, and quantitative real-time PCR
BCR/ABL was ampliﬁed from genomic DNA using Takara
Taq HS (Takara Bio Inc.) and primers speciﬁc for the e1a2
transcript of BCR/ABL and Sphk2 using primers (see Supplementary Data). Products were separated on agarose gels and
stained with ethidium bromide (Amresco; BCR/ABL) or Midori
Green (Nippon Genetics) and visualized using Molecular Imager Gel Doc XR (Bio-Rad).
RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, and quantitative
RT-PCR performed using SYBR Green Real-Time PCR Master
Mix (Invitrogen). Products were normalized to glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and analyzed on RotorGene software. Further details are in Supplementary Data and
Supplementary Table S2.

Induction of BCR/ABL–positive ALL in mice. pMSCV
retroviral vectors containing a 50 -LTR–driven p185 BCR/ABL
and internal ribosome entry site (IRES) enhanced GFP (provided by Dr. C. Mullighan, St Jude Children's Research Hospital,
Memphis, TN) were used to generate helper-free retrovirus
after transient transfection of HEK293T cells using FuGENE 6
Transfection Reagent (Roche). B-cell progenitors were isolated
by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis from
wild-type (WT) and B6N.129S6-Sphk2tm1Rlp (SK2/; Prof.
R. Proia, Bethesda, MD) C57Bl6 mouse bone marrow (BM;
Supplementary Fig. S2). The number did not signiﬁcantly differ
between WT and SK2/ mice (Supplementary Fig. S3). B-cell
progenitors were transduced with four additions of retroviral
supernatants over 24 hours on OP9 murine BM stroma in the
presence of 20 ng/mL interleukin (IL)-3, 30 ng/mL IL-7, 20
ng/mL SCF, and 10 ng/mL Flt-3 ligand (R&D Systems). Transduced cells were injected into sublethally (5 Gy) irradiated
WT mice (ARC). The transduction efﬁciency of WT and
SK2/ B-cell progenitors using the p185 BCR/ABL viral particles was 13.2  4.3% and 13.6  3.8, respectively.

ABC294640 (xenografts 1345 and 1999), or vehicle (PBS) were
administered daily for 21 days by intraperitoneal injection and
the animals were sacriﬁced. The percentage of human cells in
the peripheral blood (assessed weekly), BM, and spleen was
assessed by ﬂow cytometry as described (28). Total leukemia
was calculated on the basis of the BM from one femur
representing 5.8% of the total BM and a blood volume of 80
mL/kg of body weight.
For survival studies, mice engrafted with ALL as above were
treated for 21 days with 100 mg/kg of ABC294640 when
approximately 1% leukemia was detected in the blood. Animals
were sacriﬁced as required due to deteriorating health scores.
Statistical analysis
The expression of the gene signatures in ALL cells was
performed using the Mann–Whitney test. The fractional product method (27) was used to discriminate between synergistic
and antagonistic effects of drug combinations with a value of
>0.1 indicating antagonism and <0.1 indicating synergy.
Comparisons between two groups were performed using the
Student t test and between multiple groups using ANOVA
analysis. A level of signiﬁcance of < 0.05 was deemed significant. For survival studies, Kaplan–Meier analysis was performed and a log-rank test used to determine signiﬁcance with
Bonferoni's correction for multiple comparisons.

Results
Pharmacologic inhibition of SK2 reduces ALL cell
proliferation and survival in vitro and induces caspaseindependent cell death
Here, we show that ABC294640 reduced SK2 activity and
S1P production in leukemic cell lines but did not affect SK1
activity or protein expression (Fig. 1A and Supplementary
Figs. S1 and S4A). SK2 inhibition consistently reduced cell
proliferation (Fig. 1B and data not shown), and induced cell
death (Fig. 1C) in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1E) with
IC50 values at 24 hours being signiﬁcantly higher than those
measured at later time points (P < 0.001, ANOVA test with
repeated measures). Furthermore, SK2 inhibition also
induced cell death in patient ALL cells (Fig. 1D) while IC50
concentrations for normal BM mononuclear cells and B-cell
progenitors were not achieved even after 72 hours (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Inhibition of SK2 resulted in externalization of phosphatidylserine (Fig. 1F); however, a transition from Annexin
Vþ/PI (early apoptosis) to Annexin Vþ/PIþ (late apoptosis)
was not clear (Fig. 1F). Apoptotic cells, as deﬁned by nuclear
condensation and apoptotic bodies on examination by light
microscopy, were largely absent in ABC294640-treated cultures (Supplementary Fig. S6) despite cleavage of caspase-3
(Fig. 1G). Although caspase inhibition signiﬁcantly inhibited
apoptosis induced by doxorubicin, it did not signiﬁcantly
reduce ABC294640-induced cell death (P ¼ 0.18; n ¼ 8; Fig.
1H). Although LC3-I was processed to LC3-II following SK2
inhibition (Fig. 1I), the autophagy inhibitor 3MA did not
diminish ABC294640-induced cell death (Fig. 1J), despite

reducing LC3 processing (data not shown). Overall, cell
death following SK2 inhibition was largely caspase-independent and lacked morphologic features of apoptosis.
Although autophagy was occurring following ABC294640
treatment, this was not the mechanism of cell death.
SK expression in ALL
To establish a gene signature for activation of SK2, we
treated ALL cell lines with the SK2-speciﬁc inhibitor
ABC294640 and analyzed gene expression by microarray. A
Diff P value ﬁlter produced a list of 12 probes representing 11
genes, and principal component analysis identiﬁed 40 probes
representing 35 genes (Fig. 2A). Notably, a gene signature
could not be generated from cells treated with the SK1speciﬁc inhibitor SK1-I (29) and the genes regulated by the
SK2 inhibitor were not altered in cells treated with the SK1
inhibitor SK1-I (Supplementary Fig. S7), demonstrating speciﬁcity of the signature to SK2. Regulation of selected genes
was conﬁrmed by quantitative real time (qRT-PCR; Supplementary Fig. S8). Both SK2 gene signatures segregated control and ABC294640-treated cell lines using hierarchical

clustering and Qlucore software (Fig. 2A and data not shown)
and were validated using an additional ﬁve cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S9). In contrast, these signatures could not
separate cells treated with SK1-I from control-treated cells
(Supplementary Fig. S7). The SK2 signatures were used to
interrogate a large publicly available gene expression dataset
obtained from pediatric patients with ALL at the time of
diagnosis (GSE28497; ref. 30). SK2 activity signatures were
higher in ALL samples (P ¼ 0.001 and P ¼ 0.027; Fig. 2B and
data not shown) than normal B-cell progenitors. The SPHK2
gene was not overexpressed; however, increased SK2 protein
was detected (Fig. 2C) with increased phosphorylation, suggesting increased enzymatic activity (Fig. 2C). Together,
these data show activation of SK2 without increased gene
expression.
SK2 inhibition in ALL inhibits expression of MYC and cMyc–regulated genes
To determine the mechanism by which inhibition of SK2
induced cell death in ALL, we undertook microarray analysis
of control and ABC294640-treated cells at the earlier time

(log2 fold change, 0.73; P ¼ 0.001) while TSC22D3 and
TRIB3 were within normal limits. MYC remained signiﬁcantly decreased at 24 hours in all nine cell lines and metacore
analysis identiﬁed c-Myc as the transcription factor most
signiﬁcantly associated with the changes in gene expression
in these cell lines (P < 1.0e250; z-Score ¼ 90.57; g-Score ¼
93.07; Supplementary Table S3). Downregulation of MYC
expression was conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3C), but was
not observed following treatment with the SK1-selective
inhibitor PF543 (Supplementary Fig. S10). c-Myc protein
was also markedly reduced by ABC294640 (Fig. 3D) and was
also decreased following knockdown of SK2 by siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S11). Despite recent reports of increased
Sphk1 expression in the absence of Sphk2 (31), SPHK1 gene
expression was not increased by SK2 inhibition as determined by microarray analysis.
We questioned whether changes in c-Myc–regulated
genes could segregate SK2 inhibitor–treated ALL cells from
their respective controls. To this end, we extracted three
previously published c-Myc gene signatures (22, 32, 33) from
the original and the validation microarray data sets. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering separated the SK2 inhibitor–
treated cells from control-treated cells (Fig. 3E and Supplementary Fig. S12). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
demonstrated a signiﬁcant negative enrichment of both the
Bild and Schuhmacher c-Myc signatures in SK2-inhibited
cells. The speciﬁcity of this effect was apparent from the lack
of any consistent association between NF-kB or PI3K/AKT
pathway members or SP1 targets (Fig. 3F and Supplementary
Table S4) and the absence of these signatures in SK1-I–
treated cells (P ¼ 0.17 and 0.08, respectively; Supplementary
Fig. S10). This suggests that regulation of MYC plays a
signiﬁcant role in the response of ALL cells to SK2 but not
SK1 inhibition. Interrogation of the GSE28497 data set using
the Schuhmacher and colleagues' (33) c-Myc signature found
c-Myc targets to be increased in diagnostic patient samples
(P ¼ 0.019) consistent with the overexpression of MYC in
these patient samples (Fig. 3G).

SK2 inhibition reduces the association of histone H3
acetylated on lysine 9 with the MYC promoter
It has been reported that SK2 binds to HDAC in the
nucleus and that locally produced S1P inhibits HDAC activity, resulting in increased acetylation of histones including
histone H3 on Lys9 (H3K9ac; ref. 16). We conﬁrmed these
data, showing that SK2 inhibition reduced the amount of
S1P associated with HDAC2 (Supplementary Fig. S13A).
ENCODE/Broad (34) report that H3K9ac associates with
MYC (Fig. 4A) and using ChIP followed by qPCR of MYC
promoter elements, SK2 inhibition was found to reduce the
association of MYC with H3K9ac (Fig. 4B). In support of a
role for c-Myc suppression in ALL cell death following SK2
inhibition, the c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4 induced cell death
in ALL cell lines in a time-dependent manner similar to that
observed following SK2 inhibition (Fig. 4C). Exogenous
expression of MYC also provided a degree of resistance to
ABC294640 (Supplementary Fig. S13B). The association of
NME1 and NUP62 promoters (Fig. 4D) with H3K9ac was

Supplementary Fig. S14).

Concurrent Bcr/Abl and SK2 inhibition produces
synergistic effects in Phþ ALL
New therapies for ALL will almost certainly be used in
combination with established chemotherapy regimens. No
signiﬁcant interactive effects between SK2 inhibition and
vincristine or doxorubicin were observed, with the fractional product method showing at best additive effects (Fig. 5A
and Supplementary Fig. S14). In contrast, synergistic cell
death was observed at all time points when inhibition of SK2
was combined with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
(Fig. 5B).
Imatinib inhibited proliferation, but had little effect on the
viability of Phþ ALL cell lines (Fig. 5C and D). However, known
resistance-inducing mutations in BCR/ABL were not detected.
Resistance to imatinib-induced cell death was overcome by
concurrent SK2 inhibition and clear synergistic interactions

SK2 inhibition is effective in a human xenograft model of
B-lineage ALL
Intraperitoneal injection of nonobese diabetic/severe
combined immunodeﬁcient (NOD/SCID) IL2g c/ mice with
ABC294640 reduced plasma S1P concentrations by 23% after
2 hours, with a further decrease (45%) by 6 hours, and levels
remained signiﬁcantly suppressed for at least 24 hours
(Supplementary Table S5). This indicates that ABC294640
signiﬁcantly inhibits SK2 activity, reducing S1P plasma levels
in vivo, consistent with the ﬁndings by Beljanski and colleagues (35). NOD/SCID IL2g c/ mice engrafted with human
ALL cells were treated with 100 mg/kg/day ABC294640 or
vehicle by intraperitoneal injection for 21 days, after which
all animals were sacriﬁced. The percentage of ALL cells in the

signiﬁcantly reduced in xenograft 1999 only (Fig. 6A–C, top).
Average absolute levels of leukemia in the BM of SK2
inhibitor–treated mice were reduced by between 40% and
60% (P  0.004; Fig. 6A, bottom). Reductions in the blood
were between 60% and 67% (P < 0.002) and in the spleen by
38% and 79% (P < 0.0001) for xenografts 1999 and 1345 (Fig.
6B and C, bottom). Overall, inhibition of SK2 decreased the
level of disease in all xenografts between 40% and 78% (P 
0.00005; Fig. 6E). No overt toxicity was noted, with the
murine white blood cell (WBC) count being higher in SK2
inhibitor–treated animals bearing xenograft 1999 (P ¼ 0.018),
consistent with reduced disease, and not signiﬁcantly different in the other xenografts (Fig. 6D).
Inhibition of SK2 signiﬁcantly slowed the increase in
circulating ALL cells, prolonging the survival of mice bearing
xenograft 1999 (P ¼ 0.0012; Fig. 6F and G) from a median of
30 days for control mice [95% conﬁdence intervals (CI), 29–
30 days] to 41 days (95% CI, 32–38 days) for the treated
group. Concurrent inhibition of SK2 and Bcr/Abl with imatinib also signiﬁcantly improved the survival of mice
engrafted with a Phþ ALL (2070; Fig. 6G). In this experiment,

the median survival of control mice was 49 days (95% CI,
47.5–50.5 days) with imatinib extending survival to a median
of 65 days (95% CI, 63.4–96.6 days). Concurrent inhibition of
SK2 further extended the survival to a median of 104.5 days
(95% CI, 91.1–117.9 days; P ¼ 0.004 compared with imatinib
alone and P ¼ 0.044 compared with ABC294640 alone).
SK2 contributes to ALL development in mice
Twenty-two of 29 mice receiving BCR/ABL–transduced Bcell progenitors from WT animals developed ALL, with a
median survival of 42 days (95% CI, 32–52 days). Absence of
SK2 reduced the incidence of BCR/ABL–driven ALL to 16 of 29
animals (median survival of 58 days; 95% CI, 47–69 days; P ¼
0.002; Fig. 7A). In contrast with reports by Liang and colleagues
(31), the absence of SK2 did not result in increased SK1
expression (Supplementary Fig. S4B). The presence of BCR/
ABL and the expected deletion of Sphk2 were conﬁrmed by PCR
in all murine leukemias examined (Fig. 7B and C). All leukemias
demonstrated a B-cell progenitor phenotype (Fig. 7D), with the
majority being pre-B-ALL, lacking CD43 expression. Lymphoblasts were present in blood ﬁlms and livers from all animals

The oncogenic role of SK1 has been demonstrated in a range
of malignancies; however, the role of SK2 in cancer is largely
unknown. Overexpression of SK2 can be proapoptotic via
binding to BclXL (36) and by its role in sphingolipid metabolism,
resulting in increased levels of proapoptotic ceramide (37).
Recently, sphingolipid metabolism was shown to be required
for activation of BAK and BAX and apoptosis induction (38).
However, recent studies have demonstrated a role for SK2 in
tumor promotion (11, 35) and demonstrated that inhibition of
SK2 can inhibit the in vitro and in vivo growth of the myeloid
leukemia cell line, U937 (39). We examined the effects of Sphk2
deletion in the development of BCR/ABL–driven ALL, and SK2
inhibition in ALL cells in vitro and in vivo. Despite a recent
report showing increased SK1 in Sphk2/ mice (31), SK1 was
not increased in Sphk2/ ALL cells or following SK2 inhibition
(Supplementary Fig. S4). We also explored the mechanism by
which SK2 inhibition mediates its anticancer activity, revealing
suppression of c-Myc as a key mechanism.
A role for SK2 in ALL biology was suggested by the presence
of a gene signature consistent with increased SK2 activity in a
large cohort of pediatric ALL samples collected at diagnosis.
This was supported by the reduced incidence of ALL in a BCR/
ABL–driven model of murine ALL in the absence of Sphk2,
suggesting that SK2 plays a role in disease initiation in this
setting. However, the efﬁcacy of SK2 inhibition in established
human leukemia indicates that it is also important in disease
progression. Overall, this is the ﬁrst report demonstrating the
importance of SK2 in ALL.
Although overexpression of SK2 has been reported to produce antiproliferative effects and result in cell death, it is clear
that SK2 can also promote cell growth. The reasons for these
discrepant effects are not entirely clear. The subcellular localization of SK2 may be important for the ultimate function of
this enzyme (40). A recent study showed that siRNA knockdown of SPHK2 inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation
despite increasing S1P production (41), speaking strongly to
the importance of the localized activity of these enzymes over
global S1P production. When associated with the endoplasmic
reticulum, SK2 induced apoptosis via production of ceramide
(42), whereas translocation to the cytoplasm resulted in survival-promoting effects in colon cancer cells (43). SK2 also has
demonstrated protective effects at the mitochondria following
ischemia reperfusion injury in a number of tissues including
cardiomyocytes (44). In this study, it seems that the nuclear
localization of SK2 and its known effects on histone H3HDAC1/2 (16) were the dominant mechanism of action. In

ALL cells, SK2 increases expression of oncogenic c-Myc, presumably through localized SIP production, promoting survival
and proliferation. Consistent with this, ALL patient samples
have increased MYC expression, increased expression of cMyc–regulated genes, and are killed by c-Myc inhibition.
Furthermore, exogenous expression of MYC resulted in a
degree of resistance to SK2 inhibition by ABC294640.
SK2 inhibition has been associated with both caspasedependent (45) and -independent cell death (46), with autophagy being involved in the latter. Autophagy also has cell
survival roles (47) and although SK2 inhibition induced autophagy in ALL cells, this was not the cause of cell death, a
situation similar to that following FTY720 exposure (48).
Consistent with the lack of apoptosis, genes involved in apoptosis were not overrepresented in the microarray data (data
not shown). Inhibition of SK2 has been shown to synergize with
chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer cell lines in vitro, via
inhibition of NF-kB–mediated survival signals (49). However,
our attempts at combining conventional chemotherapeutic
agents such as vincristine and doxorubicin were disappointing,
with no signiﬁcant synergy seen. The lack of an effect on NF-kB
signaling in ALL cells when SK2 is inhibited (Supplementary
Table S4) may explain this result. We, therefore, turned our
attention to the biologic response modiﬁer bortezomib, after
reports of efﬁcacy in lymphoid malignancies (50, 51), and found
the combination of ABC294640 with this agent to be superior to
conventional drugs. In addition, inhibition of SK2 also synergized with imatinib in Phþ disease, reminiscent of work
published with SK1 inhibitors (7). Overall, this suggests that
combination treatments including SK2 inhibitors may have
potential as therapeutic strategies.
A major novel ﬁnding in this study is the downregulation of
the MYC gene and c-Myc target genes as a result of SK2
inhibition. This effect on MYC expression was speciﬁc for SK2
with SK1 inhibition failing to inﬂuence expression of MYC or cmyc target genes in ALL cells. Increased MYC and c-Myc target
gene expression in ALL samples from patients and the ability of
a c-Myc inhibitor to kill ALL cells provides evidence for a role
for c-Myc in ALL cell biology. These data potentially explain the
often opposing roles of SK2 in cell growth and survival,
inhibiting growth and survival via effects on p21 and fos, while
promoting these features by increasing expression of c-Myc.

They also highlight a potentially underappreciated role of cMyc in ALL biology and identify potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of ALL and other c-Myc–driven
malignancies.
