recent lawsuit brought against the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) demanding far wider early access to experimental
medications after the completion of phase 1 trials by patients with
terminal illnesses in a setting in which there are no known effective
therapeutic options has stimulated considerable public discussion
regarding the right of individuals to personally exert strong influence over such management decisions versus the responsibility of
government to ensure both the safety and efficacy of available treatments.1,2
Somewhat lost in this understandably highly emotionally
charged debate is the issue of the actual level of risk to patients that
might be associated with a policy of permitting individuals with an
advanced malignancy to receive anticancer agents prescribed by
their oncologists after the drugs have completed only limited phase
1 testing. Thus, an appropriate question to ask is how well do early
phase 1 trial results predict the dosages and schedules of antineoplastic agents that are ultimately used routinely in oncologic practice based on further documentation of safety and efficacy?
It would not be reasonable to propose that a simple global answer can be provided in response to this inquiry, at least partially
because of the fact that a large percentage of drugs that complete
phase 1 testing never actually enter clinical practice, either secondary to inadequate efficacy or unacceptable toxicity demonstrated in
subsequently conducted trials. However, it is possible to at least
explore this issue by examining existing data related to antineoplastic drugs that are currently in oncologic practice, and specifically
situations in which there is considerable reported experience using
the agent outside the setting of ‘‘registration-type trials.’’
This documentation of a nonregistration trial experience is particularly relevant to the question being addressed in this commentary
because it is well-recognized that registration-type trials, with their
often highly restrictive eligibility criteria, may not be representative
of the population of individuals who are likely to receive the agent

once it enters routine oncologic practice.3–5 Such differences may include older patient age, poorer performance status, the presence of clinically significant
comorbid medical conditions, and more extensive
prior therapy with an associated clinically relevant
negative impact on normal organ function (eg,
diminished bone marrow reserve or symptomatic
neuropathy).
In the current discussion, for the reasons stated
above, it is reasonable to assume that the decision to
permit wider access to new anticancer agents after
the completion of only phase 1 trials will almost certainly result in the administration of such therapies
to a substantial population of individuals who would
not have been eligible for such ‘‘registration-type’’
testing.

REGIMENS BASED ON EARLY PHASE 1 TRIAL
RESULTS VERSUS THE CURRENT USE OF SPECIFIC
ANTINEOPLASTIC DRUGS IN THE TREATMENT OF
EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CANCER
To explore this issue, an analysis was undertaken of
the experience with several phase 1 trials involving
antineoplastic agents that subsequently became
‘‘standard drugs’’ used in the management of ovarian
cancer.
For several reasons, ovarian cancer was selected
for examination in this exercise. First, because of
its inherent sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy,
ovarian cancer has played a central role in the development of multiple, widely used antineoplastic
agents.6,7 Second, extensive experience using these
drugs in the management of ovarian cancer has permitted the establishment of a reasonably robust
peer-reviewed literature that describes clinically acceptable changes from the dosages and schedules

defined in the original studies that resulted in approval of the agent by regulatory agencies. As previously stated, the aim of investigators and practicing
oncologists in exploring, and subsequently routinely
using, these modifications has been to maintain efficacy while reducing the toxicity that was observed
when the drug entered widespread clinical use.
Finally, the impact of any change in the current
regulations that will permit the substantially
expanded availability of antineoplastic agents that
have only been tested in the phase 1 setting will be
highly relevant to patients with ovarian cancer. Prolonged survival (>1–2 years) is not uncommon in
women with ovarian cancer who develop disease recurrence after primary chemotherapy.7,8 In this setting, such patients (who frequently maintain an
acceptable performance status for extended periods
of time) may receive multiple antineoplastic agents,
which are likely to be delivered sequentially.9 As a
result, it is reasonable to speculate that a decision to
permit widespread access to drugs that have only
completed phase 1 evaluations may become a routine component of ovarian cancer management, at
least for a subset of patients with this malignancy.

RESULTS
Based on the considerations noted earlier, 5 antineoplastic agents were selected for inclusion in this
analysis (Table 1). All are FDA approved for the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer, and an extensive
experience exists with their use in the malignancy either as single agents or as a component of combination chemotherapy regimens.
Because phase 1 trials are fundamentally designed to explore a variety of rational dosing, scheduling, and drug delivery (eg, oral, intravenous, or

subcutaneous) strategies, rather than to attempt to
firmly document the ‘‘single best’’ or ‘‘optimal’’ approach, there would be no inherent reason to believe
any particular phase 1 trial regimen should be
selected over another in an expanded access program. Therefore, in the current exercise, 1 or 2 published regimens from a phase 1 trial involving each
drug have simply been selected and contrasted with
current ovarian cancer treatment programs using the
agent that have been reported in the peer-reviewed
medical literature (Table 1).10–32

DISCUSSION
Several of the modifications to the doses and schedules of the analyzed agents from the phase 1 setting
to their current routine use in oncologic practice are
highly clinically relevant and have the potential to
substantially change both the drug’s toxicity profile
as well as its overall risk of serious treatment-related
side effects.
For example, reducing the single-agent dose of
liposomal doxorubicin from 60 mg/m2 to 40 mg/m2
(on an every 4-week schedule) will unquestionably
decrease the risk of the development of grade 3
hand-foot syndrome and stomatitis,29–32 and the
modified dose of 5-day topotecan (1.0–1.25 mg/m2
from 1.5–2.0 mg/m2), or delivering the drug on a 3day or weekly schedule, will lower the risk of severe
bone marrow suppression.19–28 In addition, the current intravenous cisplatin dose used in patients with
ovarian cancer (50–75 mg/m2) will certainly be associated with less emesis, nephrotoxicity, and peripheral neuropathy compared with a program of 150
mg/m2 delivered during each treatment cycle.10–12
It is important to acknowledge the limitations of
this analysis, which clearly reveal major differences
between the dosages/schedules ‘‘recommended for
future testing’’ in the phase 1 setting and what is
currently routinely used in clinical practice (at least
in the U.S.). First, although the potential for serious
side effects associated with the specific phase 1 regimens highlighted in Table 1 will certainly be greater
than that anticipated for the stated modified treatment programs, some patients will likely be able to
successfully receive the drugs in the doses/schedules
defined in the early-phase studies without experiencing excessive toxicity. Second, some of the increased
toxicities might be prevented (or at least ameliorated)
by currently available supportive care medications
(eg, antiemetics or bone marrow colony-stimulating
factors). Third, although it was quite appropriate to
include the 5 antineoplastic agents selected for evaluation in this analysis, other drugs might have been

chosen in which less substantial differences would
have been observed between the 2 periods with regard
to the evolution of their use in a particular malignancy. Finally, even for the 5 selected agents, current
routine usage may differ between ovarian cancer
patients and individuals with other malignancies.
The intent of this exercise has not been to diminish, in any manner, the extraordinary importance
of the phase 1 testing of antineoplastic agents in
defining future developmental studies, but rather to
clearly demonstrate that even for drugs that are subsequently documented to play a major role in cancer
management, the recommended dosing/schedules in
phase 1 trials may be quite different from those ultimately shown to be appropriate for routine use outside the setting of a well-designed and conducted
clinical trial. To simply assume otherwise may place
patients at risk for serious treatment-related morbidities.
