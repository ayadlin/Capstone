ABSTRACT
Drug resistance to sorafenib is common in patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma(HCC). We examined the effects of a combination  of sorafenib and
fluvastatin on HCC using in vitro and in vivo models. The dual treatment induced
apoptosis and reduced cellular viability in HCC more effectively than either drug
alone. The combination treatment also inhibited activation of hepatic stellate cells,
whereas single drug treatments did not. On a molecular level, combined treatment
inhibited activation of the MAPK and NF-κB pathways via Toll-like receptor 4 in HCC
cells. Combined treatment also inhibited expression of stromal cell-derived factor 1α
in HCC cells, which further inhibited the MAPK pathway in hepatic stellate cells. These
results suggest that a combination of sorafenib and fluvastatin may be a promising
therapeutic strategy for patients with advanced HCC.

INTRODUCTION

treatment. Thus, agents that can potentiate the anti-tumor
activity of sorafenib without significant systemic toxicity
need to be identified.
Fluvastatin, a member of the statin family, is
widely used as a lipid-lowering drug. In addition to its
cholesterol-lowering activities, fluvastatin has selective
anti-cancer effects, such as the induction of tumor cell
apoptosis in specific cancer cell lines (e.g., glioma and
breast cancer cell lines) [5, 6]. Fluvastatin has also been
suggested to have therapeutic potential for the treatment
of HCC [7]. Notably, fluvastatin was shown to increase the
cytotoxicity of sorafenib in melanoma cells [8].However,
the effects of a combination of sorafenib and fluvastatin in
HCC have not been reported.
We hypothesized that co-administration of sorafenib
and fluvastatin would have synergistic anti-tumor efficacy
against HCC compared to treatment with either drug alone.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
prevalent malignancies worldwide, and is the 5th and 7th
most common cancer in men and women, respectively [1].
As HCC is characteristically refractory to current drug
treatments, it is imperative to identify effective therapies
for the treatment of advanced HCC.
Sorafenib was the first multikinase inhibitor to
improve the overall survival of patients with advanced
HCC. This drug inhibits tumor cell proliferation
and angiogenesis and increases tumor cell apoptosis
in HCC [2]. However, sorafenib only increases the
survival time by a few months [3], and has a variety of
adverse effects, including dermatological, digestive
and cardiovascular toxicity [4]. These toxic effects may
prompt the modification or discontinuation of sorafenib

Effects of sorafenib plus fluvastatin on fibrosis
and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in
HCC

In the present study, we investigated whether simultaneous
treatment with low-dose sorafenib and fluvastatin would
have synergistic anti-tumor effects in HCC cells and in an
animal HCC model. The molecular pathways underlying
these effects were also explored.

Masson staining was performed to detect liver
fibrosis in the rat HCC model. As shown in Figure 3A,
DEN treatment induced notable accumulation of collagen
in the livers of control rats compared with normal rats
(P < 0.05). The accumulation of collagen in the liver
was not reduced by monotreatment, but was significantly
reduced by the co-treatment (Figure 3A). High α-smooth
muscle actin (α-SMA) expression in the liver was observed
in the control and monotherapy groups, while co-treatment
significantly reduced α-SMA expression (Figure  3B).
Similar results were found for the hepatic expression of
COL1A1, COL3A1 and Fibronectin (Figure 3C).
We next assessed the in vitro effects of sorafenib
and fluvastatin on the activation of HSCs. Low doses
of sorafenib and fluvastatin had no effect on the
proliferation, apoptosis or activation of HSCs (data not
shown). However, the supernatants of control HCC cells
significantly stimulated the activation of HSCs, while
the supernatants of dual-treated HCC cells inhibited the
activation of HSCs (Figure 3D). These results indicated
that the combination treatment attenuated liver fibrosis
and inhibited the activation of HSCs in HCC to a greater
extent than monotherapy.

RESULTS
Synergistic anti-tumor effects of sorafenib and
fluvastatin in vivo
Low doses of sorafenib (10 mg/kg) and fluvastatin
(10 mg/kg) were used in a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)induced HCC rat model. The visible tumor nodules were
reduced in the livers of rats of the combination group
(P < 0.05, Figure 1A and 1B), but not of either of the
single-treatment groups, compared with the control group
(vehicle treated HCC rats). Survival analysis indicated that
the survival time were longer in rats given the dual therapy
than in those given the single-agent treatments (P < 0.05,
Figure 1C). The serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels
were also lower in the combination group than in the other
groups (P < 0.05, Figure 1D). None of the rats displayed
weight loss, bleeding in the skin or major organs, or
significant hepatic or kidney injury (Figure 1E and 1F).
These data suggested that the combination treatment more
effectively inhibited tumor development in the rat HCC
model than monotherapy.

Combination treatment significantly inhibits the
expression of TLR4 in HCC

The dual treatment is superior in inhibiting
tumor proliferation and increasing apoptosis

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) contributes to
HCC initiation and progression, as well as liver
fibrosis [9]. TLR4 was overexpressed in human HCC
tissues compared to normal liver tissues (P < 0.05,
Supplementary Figure  2A). The mRNA and protein
levels of TLR4 in HCC tissues were significantly lower
in co-treated rats than in singly-treated rats (P < 0.05,
Figure 4A and 4B). Moreover, TLR4 expression in HCC
tissues correlated positively with PCNA-positivity in the
rat model (Figure 4C). In HCC cell lines (HepG2 and
SK-Hep-1 cells), lipopolysaccharide(LPS) stimulated
the expression of TLR4 in a dose-dependent manner
(Supplementary Figure 2B). TLR4 expression was
significantly lower in HCC cell lines administered
the combination treatment than in cells treated with
a single agent (P < 0.05, Figure  4D). Dual treatment
also reduced NF-κB p65 subunit binding to the TLR4
promoter, as determined by a binding activity assay
(Figure 4E). Further analysis revealed that ectopic TLR4
expression reversed the reduced cell viability following
co-treatment (Figure 4F). These data suggested that
sorafenib plus fluvastatin significantly inhibited
expression of TLR4 in HCC.

The effects of sorafenib and fluvastatin on the
viability and apoptosis of HCC cells were evaluated both
in vivo and in vitro. In the rat HCC model, a TUNEL
assay revealed greater tumor necrosis in the combination
group than in the other groups (P < 0.05) (Figure 2A).
Cell proliferation was significantly lower in the
combination group than in the control and monotherapy
groups (P < 0.05, Figure 2B), as indicated by assays of
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells.
In HCC cell lines, sorafenib reduced cell viability in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 2C), but fluvastatin at
1 μM had no significant anti-tumor effects (Supplementary
Figure 1). The combination of sorafenib and 1μM
fluvastatin reduced cell proliferation to a greater extent
than sorafenib alone (P < 0.05, Figure 2C). Low doses of
sorafenib (1 μM) or fluvastatin (1 μM) had no effect on
the apoptosis of HepG2 cells, as assessed by Annexin V/
propidium iodide (PI), while the combination treatment
significantly increased the level of apoptosis (Figure2D).
These results indicated that the dual therapy was more
effective than monotherapy in inhibiting proliferation and
inducing apoptosis in HCC.

pathways by TLR4 in HCC

of ERK and p38 were also significantly inhibited in the
co-treatment group (Figure 5D). Moreover, ectopic TLR4
expression reversed the inhibition of the MAPK and NF-κB
pathways caused by co-treatment (Figure 5E, 5F and
Supplementary Figure 3B). These data suggested that
sorafenib and fluvastatin synergistically inhibited the
activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways by TLR4
in HCC.

NF-κB and MAPK are important proteins
downstream of TLR4 that are critical stimulators of
proliferation and inhibitors of apoptosis in HCC [10].
We further investigated whether sorafenib and fluvastatin
would inhibit the NF-κB and MAPK pathways in HCC.
In the rat HCC model, the phosphorylation of ERK and
the nuclear translocation of p65 in liver tissues were
significantly lower following co-treatment than following
single drug administration (Figure 5A and 5B). In HCC cell
lines, low doses of sorafenib or fluvastatin had no effect
on p65, whereas co-treatment significantly suppressed the
nuclear protein level of p65 (Figure 5C). The activity of
the NF-κB p65 subunit in the nucleus exhibited similar
results in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA; Supplementary Figure 3A). The phosphorylation

Dual treatment inhibited the activation of HSCs
by reducing stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α
expression in HCC
The SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis has been shown to
directly stimulate HSCs differentiation to myofibroblasts
in HCC by activating the MAPK pathway [11]. Inhibition
of ERK with U0126 prevented the recombinant-SDF1α (rSDF-1α)-induced upregulation of α-SMA and
Fibronectin in HSCs, which confirmed that SDF-1α/

MAPK can stimulate HSCs (Supplementary Figure 4A).
We then investigated whether sorafenib and fluvastatin
influenced SDF-1α levels. In the rat model, SDF-1α
expression was increased in HCC tissues of the control
group, while co-treatment significantly diminished the
upregulation of SDF-1α (Figure 6A and 6B). In HCC
cell lines, the secretion of SDF-1α was also significantly
inhibited by co-treatment (Figure 6C). Chromatin

immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that
fluvastatin and sorafenib synergistically inhibited the
binding of NF-κB p65 subunit to the SDF-1α promoter
(Figure 6D). These data suggested that sorafenib plus
fluvastatin significantly inhibited SDF-1α expression in
HCC cells.

(Supplementary Figure 4B). Culture supernatants from
treated HCC cells were used to culture HSCs. The
supernatants of HepG2 cells activated the MAPK pathway
as well as the expression of Fibronectin and α-SMA in
HSCs, whereas blocking SDF-1α with neutralizing
antibody inhibited these effects (Supplementary Figure
4C). In addition, HSCs cultured with supernatants from
specific SDF-1α-silenced HepG2 cells had significantly
lower Fibronectin and α-SMA expression compared to
those cultured with supernatants from control HepG2
cells (Figure 6E and Supplementary Figure 4D). Similar
results were obtained in SK-Hep-1cells (data not shown).
These data confirmed the involvement of SDF-1α in the
activation of HSCs. The supernatants of dual-agent-treated
HCC cells inhibited ERK phosphorylation and Fibronectin
and α-SMA expression in HSCs, while rSDF-1α reversed
these inhibitory effects (Figure 6F). Our data suggested

that sorafenib plus fluvastatin inhibited the expression
and secretion of SDF-1α, which subsequently blocked the
MAPK pathway and suppressed the activation of HSCs.

DISCUSSION
Drug resistance to sorafenib is common in patients
with HCC. There is a growing need to explore combination
treatments with sorafenib to enhance the anti-tumor
effects on HCC. Fluvastatin has been suggested to have
therapeutic potential for the treatment of HCC [7]. In the
present study, we hypothesized that combining sorafenib
and fluvastatin would maximize the therapeutic effects of
these treatments. We used a low dose of sorafenib to assess
its potential synergistic effects with fluvastatin [12]. We
demonstrated that the combination treatment was superior
to either drug treatment alone in promoting apoptosis and

inhibiting proliferation in HCC, both in vivo and in vitro.
In combination, these drugs also exhibited clear synergism
in inhibiting liver fibrosis and activating HSCs. To our
knowledge, this is the first report disclosing the synergistic
effects of co-treatment with sorafenib and fluvastatin in HCC.
As an essential cell surface protein for LPS
recognition, TLR4 can activate HSCs and promote liver
fibrosis [13].TLR4 activation is central to the progression of
hepatic fibro-inflammatory disease and carcinoma [14–16].
High expression of TLR4 in HCC tissues has been shown
to be strongly associated with early recurrence and poor
survival in patients [17].Consistent with a previous study
[18], we found that TLR4 expression was greater in
human HCC samples than in normal liver samples. The
combination of sorafenib with fluvastatin significantly
reduced Tlr4 mRNA and protein levels in HCC cells, both
in vitro and in vivo. These synergistic effects may have
been due to the inhibition of p65 binding to the TLR4
promoter.
The NF-κB and MAPK pathways are major
stimulators of proliferation and inhibitors of apoptosis in
HCC. Consistent with previous studies [15, 19, 20], we

found that LPS/TLR4 signaling activated the NF-κB/
MAPK pathways. Moreover, co-treatment synergistically
inhibited the LPS/TLR4-activated NF-κB/MAPK
pathways in HCC cells.
The interaction between HCC cells and HSCs is
central to tumor progression. HCC cells secrete cytokines
and chemokines to promote the activation of HSCs, while
activated HSCs also produce chemokines to promote
tumor cell proliferation and migration [21]. A recent
study demonstrated that HSCs induce HCC resistance to
sorafenib [22].This indicates the potential involvement
of tumor fibrosis in the development of resistance to
sorafenib in HCC. Sorafenib has dual effects on HSCs and
liver fibrosis in HCC progression. Despite its inhibitory
effect on hepatic fibrogenesis, sorafenib may activate the
SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway and increase tumor-associated
fibrosis in HCC [11, 23]. Fluvastatin has been shown
to attenuate hepatic steatosis-induced liver fibrosis by
inhibiting the paracrine effects of hepatocytes on HSCs
[24]. However, the effect of fluvastatin on liver fibrosis
in HCC has never been determined. In our study, low
doses of sorafenib or fluvastatin alone could not attenuate

fibrogenesis in HCC, while dual treatment significantly
alleviated  fibrosis by inhibiting the activation of HSCs
both in vivo and in vitro.
SDF-1α is a potent chemoattractant for fibrocytes
and thus contributes to liver fibrosis. The SDF-1α/
CXCR4 pathway directly induces HSC differentiation
and proliferation by activating MAPK to increase tumorassociated fibrosis [11]. Consistent with recently reported
findings, we found that SDF-1α was overexpressed in
HCC and could activate HSCs by stimulating the MAPK
pathway. Sorafenib has been shown to elevate SDF-1α/
CXCR4 in a mouse HCC model [23]. However, in our
DEN-induced rat HCC model, sorafenib treatment did
not alter the expression of SDF-1α in HCC cells. This
difference may have been due to the low dose of sorafenib
used in our study. Single treatment with fluvastatin also
had no effect on SDF-1α expression in HCC. However,

dual treatment significantly inhibited the expression of
SDF-1α by preventing the binding of p65 to the SDF-1α
promoter in HCC cells. Our data indicated that sorafenib
plus fluvastatin inhibited the expression and secretion
of SDF-1α in HCC cells and subsequently reduced the
activation of HSCs by inhibiting the MAPK pathway.
In conclusion, the combination of sorafenib and
fluvastatin significantly inhibited cellular proliferation
and promoted apoptosis in HCC by inhibiting the TLR4activated NF-κB and MAPK pathways. Dual treatment
also significantly alleviated tumor-associated fibrosis
and inhibited the activation of HSCs by blocking the
expression and secretion of SDF-1α in HCC cells, and
subsequently inhibited the MAPK pathway in HSCs
(Figure 6G). Our results indicate that the combination of
sorafenib and fluvastatin may be a potential therapeutic
strategy for patients with advanced HCC.

obtained from Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,
Chinese Academy of Sciences. Cells were maintained
in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
and incubated in humidified air containing 5% CO2 at
37°C. Cultures were transfected with Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions for the following experiments.
To obtain conditioned media for the culture of LX-2 cells
for specific experiments, we treated HepG2 and SK-Hep-1
cells with sorafenib/fluvastatin for 24 h and washed them
three times with PBS. After routine culture of the cells for
48 h, the supernatants were collected.

Chemicals
For in vitro experiments, sorafenib (Selleck
Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA) and fluvastatin (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) were dissolved in DMSO. For in vivo
experiments, sorafenib was dissolved in a Cremophor
EL-ethanol solution (50:50, Sigma Cremophor EL :95%
ethyl alcohol) and diluted with distilled water [7], while
fluvastatin was dissolved in distilled water.

Animal studies

Cell viability assay

All protocols for animal care and use were approved
by the Animal Care Committee of the Southern Medical
University. Male Wistar rats received intraperitoneal
injections of DEN (Sigma) at 50 mg/kg weekly for
12 weeks. At the end of three months of DEN injection,
three rats were randomly chosen and killed to ensure the
development of hepatocellular carcinoma, as confirmed by
pathological analysis. Rats were then submitted to daily
gavage administration of either 10 mg/kg sorafenib (Group
Sor), 10 mg/kg fluvastatin (Group Flu), a combination
of both substances (Group Sor+Flu), or vehicle (Group
Con). Vehicle-injected normal rats were used as controls
(Group Nor). After 8 weeks of drug treatment, rats were
sacrificed for analysis (n = 6) or continuously treated
as indicated for survival analysis(n = 12). Malignant
liver nodules ≥ 3 mm in diameter were counted by two
independent investigators. Liver tissue and serum samples
were collected for later analysis.

HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates (2000 cells/well) and were treated with fluvastatin
or sorafenib for 72 h. The relative numbers of viable cells
were detected by CCK8 reagents (DingGuo Bio, Beijing,
China) [26].

TUNEL assay
Apoptotic cells in HCC tissues from rats were
analyzed with a Click-iT™ TUNEL Colorimetric IHC
Detection Kit (Thermo Fisher,  Hudson, NH, USA) in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. TUNELstained apoptotic cells were counted in five randomly
selected microscopic fields.

Apoptosis assay
Pretreated HCC cells were stained with an Annexin
V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/PI apoptosis detection kit
(BD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Stained cells were analyzed
by FACSCalibur.

Human tissue samples
The use of human samples was approved by the
patients and the ethics committee of Nanfang Hospital,
Southern Medical University. Fifty liver tumor tissue samples
from patients with HCC at Nanfang Hospital were confirmed
by pathology. Thirty normal liver tissue samples were also
collected. The patients’ characteristics are shown in Table 1.

Gene expression analysis
Total RNA was extracted and cDNA was
synthesized according to standard protocols. The cDNA
was further PCR-amplified by specific primers with an
All-in-One qPCR Mix kit (GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD,
USA). Gapdh was used as a housekeeping gene. The
primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
IHC staining was performed with standard protocols
[25]. Specific primary antibodies against TLR4, phosphoERK (p-ERK), p65, α-SMA (Abcam, Cambridge, UK),
and SDF-1α (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA)
were used. The results are expressed as the percentage
of positively stained cells in five randomly selected
microscopic fields counted by two independent researchers.

Western blotting
Protein extracts were obtained through standard
protocols [27]. Western blot analyses were performed as
described previously [27]. Specific primary antibodies
against COL1A1, COL3A1, Fibronectin, α-SMA, ERK,
IκB, phospho-IκB, JNK, phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), TLR4, p-ERK, p65 and

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

A (Santa Cruz) were used as loading controls for total
protein and nuclear protein, respectively.

The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

ELISA

FUNDING

Rat serum AFP levels were determined by ELISA
(Bio-Swamp, Shanghai, China) per the manufacturer’s
instructions. The NF-κB nuclear concentrations and SDF1α levels in the culture supernatants of treated HCC cells
were also detected by ELISA (Abcam).

This work was supported by the Postdoctoral
Research Funding of Guangzhou Women and Children’s
Medical Center [5001-2150172], the Guangdong
Natural Science Foundation [2016A030310254], China
Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M600648] and
National Natural Science Foundation [81602646].

Luciferase reporter assay
Lipofectamine 2000 was used to transfect HepG2
cells with a pGL3 [luc/SV40] reporter plasmid containing
the promoter sequence of hTLR4, or a pGL4.74 [hRluc/TK]
control plasmid. Cells were subsequently incubated with
different agents for 24 h. The firefly and Renilla luciferase
activities of the cell extracts were measured with a DualLuciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison,
WY, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
