BACKGROUND: CD22 expression occurs in >90% of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Inotuzumab ozogamicin, a
CD22 monoclonal antibody bound to calicheamicin, is active in ALL. METHODS: Patients with refractory-relapsed ALL received treatment with inotuzumab. The first 49 patients received single-dose, intravenous inotuzumab at doses of 1.3 to 1.8 mg/m2 every 3 to 4
weeks. In the next 41 patients, the schedule was modified to inotuzumab weekly at a dose of 0.8 mg/m2 on day 1 and at a dose of
0.5 mg/m2 on days 8 and 15, every 3 to 4 weeks, based on higher in vitro efficacy with more frequent exposure. RESULTS: Ninety
patients were treated; 68% were in salvage 2 or beyond. Overall, 17 patients (19%) achieved a complete response (CR), 27 (30%) had
a CR with no platelet recovery (CRp), and 8 (9%) had a bone marrow CR (no recovery of counts), for an overall response rate of 58%.
Response rates were similar for single-dose and weekly dose inotuzumab (57% vs 59%, respectively). The median survival was 6.2
months overall, 5.0 months with the single-dose schedule, and 7.3 months with the weekly dose schedule. The median survival was
9.2 months for patients in salvage 1 (37% at 1 year), 4.3 months for patients in salvage 2, and 6.6 months for patients in salvage 3 or
later. The median remission duration was 7 months. Reversible bilirubin elevation, fever, and hypotension were observed less frequently on the weekly dose. In total, 36 of 90 patients (40%) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Veno-occlusive disease
was noted in 6 of 36 patients after stem cell transplantation (17%), was less frequent after the weekly schedule (7%), and with less
alkylators in the preparative regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Inotuzumab single-agent therapy was highly active, safe, and convenient in
patients with refractory-relapsed ALL. A weekly dose schedule appeared to be equally effective and less toxic than a single-dose

INTRODUCTION
Modern multiagent combination chemotherapy regimens in adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) result in complete response (CR) rates of 80% to 90% and long-term survival rates of 35% to 50%.1-3 Improvement of adult ALL therapy is unlikely to result from further intensification therapy, because the current regimens are already associated with
significant toxicities.
Leukemic ALL cells express cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) (a B-lymphocyte antigen) in approximately 50% of
patients, and CD22 (an inhibitory receptor for B-cell receptor signaling) and CD19 (a B-lymphocyte antigen) in 90% of
patients. This provides opportunities to use new monoclonal antibodies in ALL, alone or in combinations with chemotherapy or with other monoclonal antibodies. Rituximab as a single agent had minimal activity in ALL but improved survival when combined with chemotherapy in CD20-positive ALL.4-8 This encouraged investigational therapies with other
monoclonal antibodies directed against ALL surface markers.9,10
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a CD22 monoclonal antibody bound to calicheamicin, a natural product of Micromonospora echinospora, which is significantly more toxic than cytotoxic chemotherapy.11 Inotuzumab binds CD22 with subnanomolar affinity and is rapidly internalized, delivering the conjugated calicheamicin intracellularly. Calicheamicin binds

to the minor DNA groove, causing double-strand DNA
breaks, resulting in cell apoptosis. A phase 2 study of single-dose inotuzumab 1.3 to 1.8 mg/m2 every 3 to 4 weeks
in patients with refractory and relapsed ALL resulted in a
bone marrow CR rate of 57%. Adverse events included
fever, brief episodes of hypotension, and liver function
abnormalities.12 Preclinical studies suggested that lower
dose, more frequent schedules of inotuzumab may
improve anti-ALL efficacy and reduce toxicities. This
resulted in amending the study to change the inotuzumab
dose schedule to weekly 0.8 mg/m2 on day 1 and 0.5 mg/
m2 on days 8 and 15 every 3 to 4 weeks for the same total
dose of inotuzumab 1.8 mg/m2 per course. In this report,
we update our experience in 90 patients with refractory
and relapsed ALL who received weekly inotuzumab
(n 5 41) and the previously reported (and now updated)
single-dose inotuzumab (n 5 49).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group

Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of refractory or
relapsed pre-B ALL were eligible. Eligibility criteria were
identical for the single-dose and weekly inotuzumab
schedules.12 Inclusion criteria were an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status from 0 to 3;
adequate liver function (bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL and liver
enzymes 3 times the upper limit of normal, unless considered because of leukemia) and renal function (creatinine 2.0 mg/dL); adequate cardiac function (those with
New York Heart Association class 3 or an ejection fraction <45% were excluded). Exclusion criteria included
allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in the previous
4 months, pregnant or breast-feeding women, and
patients with known hepatitis B disease.
This was a single-institution study conducted at The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The
study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review
Board, in compliance with institutional guidelines.
Patients signed informed consent in compliance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Therapy

Patients received single-dose inotuzumab from 1.3 to
1.8 mg/m2 as a short, intravenous infusion once every 3 to
4 weeks. Weekly inotuzumab was given at a dose of
0.8 mg/m2 on day 1 and 0.5 mg/m2 on days 8 and 15, for
a total dose of 1.8 mg/m2 per course. Courses were
repeated every 3 to 4 weeks. Patients received the recommended premedication with oral acetaminophen 650 mg,
Cancer

intravenous diphenhydramine 10 to 25 mg, and intravenous hydrocortisone 25 mg.
Inotuzumab was given as a short infusion over 1
hour. Courses were given every 3-4 weeks, depending
on the recovery of the counts and of the bone marrow
status on days 21 and 28. Briefly, if the bone marrow
studies revealed persistent or increasing leukemia on
days 21 and 28, then patients received a subsequent
course of inotuzumab regardless of peripheral counts.
If the blasts were reduced or were <5% by days 21
through 28, patients received a subsequent course only
after recovery of the counts to at least pretreatment levels. Persistent thrombocytopenia was not a condition
to delay therapy. In contrast to the previous study with
single-dose inotuzumab,12 the weekly dose schedule
study did not include the addition of rituximab for
patients who had stable disease or who had no
improvement or progression after 2 courses of inotuzumab. Patients who achieved a CR or a bone marrow
CR after 1 or 2 courses of therapy were allowed to
receive 2 additional courses of therapy, for a maximum
of 4 cycles. Additional treatments were based on
response and liver toxicities in the previous 4 cycles.
Patients who achieved any response also could continue
on treatment for up to 8 cycles. Subsequent cycles of
inotuzumab were given at the same dose. Patients with
grade 3 or worse toxicity and a favorable response to
therapy could receive inotuzumab in subsequent cycles
at a 25% dose reduction. Patients who developed central nervous system (CNS) leukemia on inotuzumab
and who had a positive response were allowed to continue on therapy and receive CNS-directed intrathecal
chemotherapy after an assessment of the patient’s benefit:risk ratio.
Patients received antibiotics, antifungals, and antiviral agents according to institutional guidelines. Antifungal
azoles prophylaxis was delayed for at least 24 hours after
the completion of inotuzumab. Patients with rapid
increases in white blood cell counts could receive hydroxyurea or a short course of steroids at the beginning of the
first cycle.
Suitability for allogeneic SCT was assessed in all
patients. Whenever possible, eligible patients were considered for allogeneic SCT after achieving at least a bone
marrow CR. Minimal residual disease (MRD) status was
assessed by 6-color multiparameter flow cytometry of
abnormal ALL surface antigen expression levels, according
to standard protocols. The panel included 15 antigens:
CD10, CD13, CD15, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD25,
CD33, CD34, CD38, CD45, CD52, CD58, CD66c,

and CD81. One million cells were stained with a stainlyse-wash technique, and 200,000 cells were analyzed per
sample on FacsCanto II instruments (BD Biosciences,
San Diego, Calif). Data were analyzed with FCS Express
3 software (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, Calif). Negative status was defined as the presence of <1024 lymphocytic cells.
Statistical Considerations

Response criteria were standard. A CR was defined as the
disappearance of all disease with bone marrow blasts
5%, neutrophils 1.0 3 109/L, and a platelet count
>100 3 109/L. A bone marrow CR with incomplete
recovery of platelets (CRp) was defined as a CR but without
platelet recovery to 100 3 109/L. A bone marrow CR
with incomplete recovery (CRi) was defined as CR but
without recovery of platelets to 100 3 109/L or recovery
of neutrophil counts to 109/L. Survival and response
duration were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Early stopping rules for both single-dose and weekly
inotuzumab were planned for futility if the
CR 1 CRi 1 CRp 1 partial response of total treated was
0 of 10 patients, 1 of 17 patients, 2 of 24 patients, 3 of
31 patients, and 4 of 37 patients. Overall, 40 patients
were planned to receive single-dose inotuzumab. This was
expanded to 60 patients because of high efficacy. However, the schedule was modified to a weekly schedule,
which was approved by the institutional review board and
modified after 49 patients had received single-dose inotuzumab. In total, 90 patients, including 41 patients on
weekly inotuzumab, were planned to receive treatment.
When analyzing the weekly and single-dose inotuzumab study groups, the chi-square method was used to
compare parameters. Univariate analyses were conducted
using standard methods.

Response

The 49 patients who received single-dose inotuzumab
were accrued between June 2010 and March 2011, and
the 41 patients who received weekly inotuzumab were
accrued between March 2011 and September 2012. The
median patient age in the entire study group was 39.5
years (range, 4-84 years); 25 patients (28%) were aged
60 years, and 6 patients (7%) were aged 18 years.
Nine patients (10%) had a performance status of 2 or 3.
Twenty-nine patients (32%) received inotuzumab as first
salvage treatment (Salvage 1), 34 patients (38%) received
it as Salvage 2, and 27 patients (30%) received it as Salvage 3. Ten patients (11%) had undergone prior alloge-

Overall, 17 patients (19%) achieved a CR, 27 patients
(30%) had a CRp, and 8 patients (9%) had a CRi. Thirtyfour patients (38%) had resistant disease, and 4 patients
(4%) died within 4 weeks of starting therapy. Thus,
responses were observed in 52 of the 90 patients who
received treatment, for an overall response rate of 58%.
Response rates with weekly and single-dose inotuzumab
were similar (Table 2). The median number of cycles was
2 (range, 1-6 cycles) with weekly and 2 (range, 1-5 cycles)
with single-dose inotuzumab.

at the start of therapy and had sufficient metaphases for
analysis at morphologic CR. Among these, a cytogenetic
CR was observed in 26 patients (90%). The rate of cytogenetic CR by morphologic responses was as follows: 8
cytogenetic CR/9 morphologic CR (89%); 11 cytogenetic
CR/13 morphologic CRp (85%); and 7 cytogenetic CR/7
a morphologic CRi (100%). Multiparameter flow cytometric studies for MRD were performed in 50 patients
who achieved a morphologic bone marrow CR. Negative
MRD status was observed in 36 of 50 responding patients
(72%). Considering the total study group, negative MRD
status was achieved in 17 of 41 patients who received
weekly inotuzumab (41%) and in 19 of 49 patients (39%)
who received single-dose inotuzumab (P value not significant). The rate of MRD-negative status according to morphologic response was as follows: 14 MRD-negative/17
CR (82%); 19 MRD-negative/25 CRp (76%); and 3
MRD-negative/8 CRi (38%).
Most patients who achieved a CR obtained it early
(there were 14 CRs after 1 course and 3 CRs after 2 or
more courses). Among the patients who achieved a CRp,
16 achieved it after 1 course, and 11 achieved it after 2 or
more courses. Among the patients who achieved a CRi, 1
achieved it after 1 course, and 7 achieved it after 2 or more
courses.
In the total study group, lower response rates
were observed among patients who had Philadelphia
chromosome-positive ALL and those who had translocation t(4,11) (38%-40% vs 57%-81% for others;
P 5 .047). The response rate was also lower in patients
who were treated in Salvage 2 or later (48%-50% vs
76% in Salvage 1; P 5 .056) (Table 3). Considering
the small numbers, the trends of associations were similar with the weekly and single-dose inotuzumab
schedules.

Outcome

The median overall survival of patients who received inotuzumab was 6.2 months (Fig. 1). Censoring for the time
of allogeneic SCT revealed similar survival, suggesting a
lack of benefit from allogeneic SCT. The median survival
was 5.0 months with the single-dose schedule and 7.3
months with the weekly schedule. The median remission
duration was 7 months (1-year rate, 42%). Survival by salvage number, response to treatment, and MRD status
among responders is illustrated in Figure 2A-C for the
entire study group of 90 patients. Patients who received
treatment in Salvage 1 had a median survival of 9.2
months and an estimated 1-year survival rate of 37%. The
median survival was 13.1 months for patients who
achieved a CR, 7.4 months for those who achieved a
CRp 1 CRi, and 3.1 months for those who had resistant
disease. Although survival did not differ between MRDpositive patients (n 5 14) and MRD-negative patients
(n 5 36; median survival, 7.8 months vs 7.9 months,
respectively; 1-year survival rate, 9% vs 32%, respectively;
P 5 .48), remission duration tended to favor MRD-negative patients (median remission duration, 5.1 months vs
11.5 months, respectively; P 5 .25). There were no differences in these 3 parameters according to whether patients
received weekly or single-dose inotuzumab.

Pharmacokinetic Studies

Measurements of inotuzumab levels were conducted at
the end of infusion, 3 hours after the end of infusion, and
on days 7 and 8. Patients who achieved a bone marrow
CR had lower clearance rates and higher area under the
curve (AUC) levels compared with patients who failed to
achieve a response (Fig. 3A and B). Higher inotuzumab
peak levels were observed with single-dose inotuzumab
(data not shown), but inotuzumab peak levels did not correlate with response rates. (Fig. 3C).
Treatment Side Effects

With weekly inotuzumab, previously observed, prominent
side effects associated with single-dose inotuzumab were less
frequent, in particular, fever and hypotension within 48
hours of drug administration and liver function abnormalities. With weekly inotuzumab, 2 patients experienced grade
1 or 2 bilirubin elevations, and no patients had grade 3 bilirubin elevations. Grade 1 or 2 elevations of liver enzymes were
observed in 9 patients, and grade 3 elevations were observed
in 2 patients. All were reversible within 1 or 2 weeks. Singledose inotuzumab was associated with persistent liver function
abnormalities in 2 of 49 patients, but no such occurrences
were noted with weekly inotuzumab. (Table 4)
Feasibility of Subsequent Allogeneic Stem Cell
Transplantation

The median follow-up was 4 months (range, 1-19 months)
on weekly inotuzumab and 21 months (range, 5.4-28
2732

months) on single-dose inotuzumab. Among the 41
patients who received weekly inotuzumab, 14 patients
(34%) were able to proceed to allogeneic SCT (6 related
donors, 5 match unrelated donors, 2 haploidentical related
donors, and 1 cord donor). Among the 49 patients who
received single-dose inotuzumab, 22 patients (45%) were
able to proceed to allogeneic SCT (7 related donors, 14
unrelated donors, and 1 mismatched cord donor).
Currently, 9 of 14 patients on weekly inotuzumab and 4 of
22 patients on single-dose inotuzumab remain in remission
and alive after undergoing allogeneic SCT. The median
time from the start of inotuzumab therapy to allogeneic
SCT was 11 weeks (range, 5-25 weeks), and the median
time from the end of inotuzumab therapy to allogeneic
SCT was 5 weeks (range, 2-14 weeks). With the current
follow-up, 13 patients remain alive without evidence of disease. Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) was observed in 1 of 14
patients who underwent allogeneic SCT after weekly inotuzumab and in 5 of 22 patients who underwent allogeneic
SCT after single-dose inotuzumab. This also may be related
to the preparative regimen: VOD was observed in 5 of 13
patients who received a preparative regimen that included 2
alkylating agents but in only 1 of 21 patients who received a
regimen that included 1 alkylating agent (P 5 .02).

schedules, weekly (n 5 41) and single-dose (n 5 49), we
identified inotuzumab as 1 of the most potent anti-ALL
agents. Overall, 58% of patients achieved a bone marrow
CR. There was no difference in the response rate according to whether patients received weekly or single-dose inotuzumab. Despite the achievement of deep levels of
remission, as determined by cytogenetic CRs and negative
MRD status, response durations were brief, and the median overall survival was 6.2 months (1-year survival rate,
20%). Thus monoclonal antibody therapy with inotuzumab, and with monoclonal antibodies (blinatumomab)
that target other ALL surface markers (CD19), have demonstrated very promising anti-ALL activity with bone
marrow CR rates from 50% to 75%, depending on the
patient and the leukemia characteristics. These monoclonal antibodies potentially offer the first highly active
modalities that produce bone marrow CR rates equivalent
or superior to those observed with intensive chemotherapy
but without the notorious toxicities of the latter. Compared with our historic experience using intensive chemotherapy in 292 patients with refractory-relapsed ALL, the
CR1CRi rate with inotuzumab in this study was 47%
versus 29% overall. In Salvage 1, the CR1CRi rate was
61% versus 40%; in Salvage 2, the CR1CRi rate was
44% versus 16%; and in Salvage 3 or later, the CR1CRi
rate was 37% versus 16%.13,14 In the future, combining
different monoclonal antibodies or using combinations of
chemotherapy with monoclonal antibodies may prolong
survival in ALL salvage and improve the cure rate in
patients with newly diagnosed ALL.
Lower response rates were observed among patients
known historically to have more refractory disease, including patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL
and those with ALL and t(4,11), as expected. Similarly,
response rates were lower in patients who received
inotuzumab in Salvage 2 or later compared with Salvage
1. However, even among the worst patient categories,
inotuzumab was able to produce a bone marrow CR rate
substantially higher than what is expected with intensive
chemotherapy, although these responses have been
transient.
Single-dose inotuzumab therapy has been associated
with liver function abnormalities, occasional VOD after
allogeneic SCT, and transient febrile and hypotensive
episodes. These were less frequent with the weekly schedule of inotuzumab and were probably related to the peak
levels of inotuzumab. Peak inotuzumab levels were not
associated with differences in the response rate, whereas
inotuzumab cumulative AUC levels, which were equivalent with weekly and single-dose inotuzumab, were

Grade 1 and 2 side effects were significantly lower with weekly inotuzumab in relation to drug-related fever (P <.0001), increased bilirubin (P 5.01), and
increased liver enzymes (P 5 0.001). No significant differences were observed in grade 3 and 4 side effects with weekly versus single-dose inotuzumab
schedules.

associated with significant differences in the bone marrow
response rate. Thus, the weekly versus single-dose clinical
experience, supported by pharmacokinetic studies, indicates that weekly inotuzumab is as effective and is less
toxic than single-dose inotuzumab. On the basis of these
experiences, a pivotal trial of weekly inotuzumab versus
intensive chemotherapy in patients with refractory and
relapsed ALL in first or second salvage is ongoing.
Despite the high response rates observed,
responses were not durable, and median survival was
modest. However, the responses obtained with inotuzumab allowed >40% of patients to proceed to allogeneic SCT, compared with only 17% of patients who
achieved a CR with intensive chemotherapy in our historic experience (5% of the total salvage population).14
This suggests that, with proper modifications of the
preparative regimens and perhaps with combinations of
inotuzumab and chemotherapy before SCT, in the
future, we may achieve long-term disease-free survival
in a substantial proportion of patients using sequential
combined modality strategies and allogeneic SCT.
Future studies will also evaluate inotuzumab in combination with chemotherapy to improve the cure rates in
newly diagnosed patients with adult ALL.
