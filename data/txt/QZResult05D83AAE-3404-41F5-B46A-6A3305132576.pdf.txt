ABSTRACT
T helper (Th) cell imbalance plays important roles in tumor development and
their effects in Multiple myeloma (MM) remain unclear. In the present study, we
investigated the levels and clinical significance of Th22, Th17 and Th1 cells in
patients with MM. Th subsets were examined by flow cytometry. Plasma IL-22,
IL-17A and IFN-γ concentrations were measured by ELISA. AHR and RORC mRNA
expression was examined by RT-PCR. Here, we found that the frequency of Th22
cells was significantly elevated in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) of
newly-diagnosed MM patients, and recovered in complete remission patients after
chemotherapy. The circulating Th17 cells accompanied by IL-17A levels were also
up-regulated in MM patients and decreased after remission. We also found that there
was a significantly positive correlation between Th22 and Th17 cells in MM patients.
Moreover, the frequencies of Th22 and Th17 cells were higher in stage III than in
stage I+II of MM. Our data demonstrated that Th22 and Th17 cells might be important
therapeutic targets in multiple myeloma and could facilitate the effect of antitumor
immunotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

(RORC), was identified on the basis of producing IL17A but not IFN-γ [4]. Th22 is a more recently identified
human inflammatory Th subset, which is characterized by
abundant secretion of IL-22 and TNF-α, but not IFN-γ,
IL-4 or IL-17A [5]. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) has
been considered to be the key transcription factor of Th22
subset and is involved in IL-22 expression [6]. Both Th17
and Th22 are proved to be involved in the pathophysiology
of autoimmunity and tumorigenesis. Before the discovery
of Th17 and Th22 cells, inflammatory CD4+ T cell studies
in diseases mainly focused on Th1 cells, which produce
IFN-γ as their signature cytokine [7].
Abundant evidences about Th17 have focused on
patients with autoimmune diseases while there are very
few studies on cancer patients, and the specific role
of Th17 in cancer is debatable [8]. In the case of MM,
the previous researches associated with Th17 and IL-17

Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the
clonal expansion of plasma cells and the systemic damage
caused by monoclonal protein [1]. The pathogenesis of
MM is complex and heterogeneous, which involves a
series of genetic and immunological alterations. Many
abnormalities of T cell number or function have been
observed in patients with MM. However, the precise
mechanisms and biologic basis for these abnormalities
remain unclear [2, 3].
Accumulating evidences have demonstrated that T
helper (Th) cells play critical roles in the development
and progression of inflammatory diseases, autoimmune
diseases and malignant tumors. Th17, a novel CD4
subset, which expresses the lineage-specific transcription

were contradictory. Prabhala et al observed significantly
increased Th17 and IL-17A in MM which promoted MM
cell growth as well as suppressed immune responses
[9]. Alexandrakis et al [10] and Shen CL et al [11] also
demonstrated increasing levels of Th17 and IL-17 in
association with higher disease stage, and suggested that
IL-17 plays a role in promoting angiogenesis and disease
progression in MM. However, Braga et al. considered that
Th17 may promote immune responses in MM patients [2].
As for the conflicting results, another research explained
that the suppressing or promoting effect of higher IL-17
in MM may be due to the balance between IL-17A and
IL-17E [12]. Therefore, the mechanisms of Th17 immune
abnormalities in MM remain elusive.
Th22 cells have been shown to be important in
the pathogenesis of many autoimmunity diseases. Our
and other studies demonstrated that Th22 were elevated
in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) [13],
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [14], ankylosing
spondylitis (AS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [15].
However, up to now, there is no data available with
regard to the roles of Th22 and related cytokines in the
pathophysiology of MM. In addition, the relationship of
Th22 with Th17 or Th1 in MM patients is still unclear and
remains to be clarified.
Therefore, in order to identify and describe
the possible roles of Th22 and Th17 subsets in the
pathogenesis of MM, we investigated the proportions of
pure Th17 (CD4+ IFN-γ-IL-17A+IL-22- T cells), pure Th22
(CD4+IFN-γ-IL-22+IL-17A- T cells) as well as Th1 cells
(CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells) in the peripheral blood and bone
marrow by flow cytometry, concentrations of plasma IL17A, IL-22 and IFN-γ by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) along with the mRNA expression levels of
RORC, AHR in Chinese patients with MM. We evaluated
their clinical relevance and relationship with therapy.
Furthermore, their correlation with disease severity was
also assayed in this study.

Both peripheral and bone marrow Th22 cells
were elevated in newly-diagnosed MM patients
and recovered after complete remission
The typical dot plots of Th22 cells in representative
MM patients and healthy controls were shown in Fig. 1
I-M. Compared with healthy controls (1.04±0.61%), the
frequency of peripheral Th22 was observably elevated
in ND patients (1.87±0.96%, P=0.048), NR patients
(1.68±0.49%, P=0.025) or RP patients (2.03±0.34%,
P=0.011). Furthermore, a significant decrease of
peripheral Th22 was seen in CR patients (1.17±1.29%)
after chemotherapy compared with ND (P=0.003), NR
(P=0.046) or RP (P=0.032) patients (Fig. 2D). Meanwhile,
we further analyzed the frequency of Th22 cells in BM
and found there was a remarkable increase in ND patients
(2.04±1.43%, P=0.022) compared with those in controls
(0.68±0.27%). The frequency of Th22 in CR patients
(1.08±0.86%) was lower than that in ND patients but still
higher than controls (Fig. 2E). No significant difference of
Th22 was found between PB and BM in MM patients or
controls (Fig. 2F).
As for PB plasma IL-22, there was no significant
difference between each group (ND: median, 61.34, range:
50.31-79.49 pg/ml; CR: median, 65.23, range: 49.66145.34 pg/ml; NR: median, 63.93, range: 49.01-112.46
pg/ml; RP: median, 65.23, range: 56.15-76.25 pg/ml;
controls: median, 58.10, range: 47.71-75.60 pg/ml) (Fig. 3
E and Table1). Similarly, the levels of BM plasma IL-22 in
ND, CR MM patients and controls were not significantly
different (ND: median, 59.72, range: 49.00-67.18 pg/ml,
P>0.05; CR: median, 56.47, range: 53.56-67.82 pg/ml,
P>0.05; control: median, 61.02, range: 53.56-62.64 pg/
ml) (Fig. 3F).
No correlation was identified between peripheral
Th22 frequency and circulating IL-22 level.

Circulating Th17 cells accompanied by IL-17A
levels were up-regulated in MM patients and
decreased after remission

PB plasma IL-17A in NR patients (median, 3.26; range,
1.04–5.14 pg/ml), RP patients (median, 2.20; range, 0.90–
4.63 pg/ml) and controls (median, 2.73; range, 0.95–5.57
pg/ml) were lower than those in ND patients, no statistical
significance was observed (Fig. 3C and Table1). As for the
BM plasma IL-17 level, a statistical increase was found
in ND patients compared with healthy controls (Fig. 3D).
However, no correlation was found between Th17
cells and plasma levels of IL-17A both in PB and BM of
MM patients.

Peripheral Th17 cells were markedly increased
in patients with ND MM ( 2.32±0.45%) than those in
control group (1.63±0.16%, P=0.048). Additionally, the
percentages of Th17 cells in NR patients (2.52±1.58%) or
RP patients (2.49±2.22% ) were also higher compared to
controls, but did not reach statistical difference (P>0.05).
Moreover, the frequency of Th17 cells in CR patients
(1.34±0.73%, P=0.013) was significantly decreased
compared with ND patients (Fig. 2A). Meanwhile, we
also evaluated the frequency of Th17 cells in the BM
microenvironment of MM patients, and the results
showed that Th17 percentage in ND patients was higher
(2.6 ± 2.7%) than that in CR patients (1.43±1.30%) or in
control groups (1.25±0.40%), but did not reach statistical
difference (P>0.05) (Fig. 2B). Additionally, we compared
Th17 cells between PB and BM in MM patients or
controls, and no statistical difference was found (Fig. 2C).
The levels of IL-17A in PB and BM were measured
by ELISA. Compared with ND patients (median, 4.67;
range, 0.99-8.78 pg/ml), PB plasma IL-17A level was
significantly decreased in CR patients (median, 2.22;
range, 0.86–7.32 pg/ml, P=0.004). Although the levels of

In these experiments, we also examined the
frequencies of CD4+ IFN-γ-IL-17A+IL-22+ T cells in
MM patients. The percentage of circulating CD4+IFN-γIL-17A+IL-22+ T cell was significantly increased in ND
(0.40±0.20%), NR (0.52±0.04%) and RP (0.77±0.58%)
patients compared with healthy controls (0.13±0.04%).
In addition, in CR patients (0.24±0.09%), the percentage
of this double-positive cells was markedly decreased than
those in ND patients but still higher than those in healthy
controls (Fig. 1I-M).

P>0.05). However, as for the BM plasma IFN-γ level,
a statistical increase was only found in CR patients
compared with healthy controls (Fig. 3A, 3B and Table 1).

For peripheral Th1 cells, as shown in Fig. 1 D-H
and Fig. 2G, no significant difference was observed
between each group (ND: 18.96±9.55%, P>0.05; CR:

DISCUSSION
Multiple myeloma is characterized by the
uncontrolled proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells in
the bone marrow. Although bortezomib combined with
chemotherapy and transplantation is relatively effective
treatment, MM continues to be an incurable disease with
fatal outcome for the majority of patients at advanced
stages. Therefore, exploration of novel therapeutic
modalities should be pursued [16].
The host immune system dysfunction has a pivotal
role for plasma cells and is responsible for some clinical
manifestations of MM [17, 18]. Recently, the aberrance
of T helper cells has been described to be involved in the
pathogenesis of MM patients. However, the biologic basis
of this dysfunction remains ill-defined. So in this study,
we examined the frequencies of Th22, Th17 and Th1 cells

The relationships between the frequency of
Th1/Th17/Th22 cells and various clinicopathological
characteristics across the study population are shown in
Table 2. There was no relationship between the proportion
of Th1/Th17/Th22 cells and patient age or gender. There
is also no relationship between Th1/Th17/Th22 cells and
MM subtype.

Th22 as well as Th17 cells up-regulated with the
increase of MM clinical stage
We further analyzed the relationship between
Th1/Th17/Th22 cells and tumor stage. As shown in Fig.
5A, peripheral Th17 significantly increased in stage III

and the concentrations of plasma IL-22, IL-17A and IFN-γ
along with specific transcription factor expression in MM
patients and healthy controls.
Compared with the well-known Th1, Th2 and
Th17, Th22 is a newly-identified Th subset with a
specific phenotype and distinct function. IL-22 was also
secreted by activated Th1, Th17, NK cells, NKT cells
and lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells [19]. Th22 and
IL-22 were recently reported to play important roles
in chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis [19]. So
far, there is little data with regard to the Th22 cells and
related cytokines in the onset and development of MM.
Recently, Giulia et al. found that IL-22+IL-17-IL-13+ T
cells increased in PB and BM of stage III and RP MM
patients compared with asymptomatic or stage I/II patients
and controls. They also found a fraction of MM cell lines
and primary tumors aberrantly expressed IL-22RA1 and
demonstrated that IL-22 induced STAT-3 phosphorylation,
cell growth, and resistance to drug. They concluded that
Th22 cells increase in poor prognosis MM and promote
tumor cell growth and survival [20]. In the present study,
we identified a notably expanded Th22 population in PB
and BM microenvironment of MM patients compared
with healthy controls. Moreover, the frequency of Th22
cells in MM patients who achieved complete remission
was significantly reduced after chemotherapy, which
indicated that chemotherapy may partly ameliorate this
Th22 turmoil. These suggested that measurement of
Th22 frequency may be useful in evaluating therapeutic
effect. Similarly, our results also demonstrated that Th22
percentage in stage III was significantly higher than that
in stage I+II patients, while Th22 percentage in stage I+II
patients was also higher that in healthy controls. These
findings suggest that there was a significant relationship
between Th22 and clinical tumor stage, and further prove
the potential pathogenesis of Th22 in MM.
The expression level of cytokine IL-22 and specific

transcription factor AHR has not been investigated in MM
until today. IL-22 belongs to the IL-10 cytokine family
and is a less well-defined tissue-instructing cytokine [21].
However, inconsistent with the Th22 in MM patients,
our results demonstrated that IL-22 level either in PB or
BM of MM patients was comparable with that of healthy
controls, and no correlation with peripheral Th22 was
found. This phenomenon may indicate that the unilateral
increased frequency of Th22 contributes little to the IL22 production on account of IL-22 is not exclusively
produced by Th22 cells. While, in accordance, the
mRNA expression of AHR was elevated in MM patients
compared with healthy controls, notwithstanding there
was no significant difference, this may be due to the
limited sample numbers. Obviously, further researches of
larger sample size are needed to explain the specific roles
of Th22 cells in MM patients.
By far, the impact of Th17 and associated cytokines
on cancer development is still under debate. Although
multiple reports indicate that Th17 can promote anticancer
immunity, others have argued that these cells may exhibit
tumor-promoting properties [8]. Currently, there are a
few reports indicate an increase of Th17 cells in the PB
and BM of MM patients, which are in accordance with
our findings [10, 12, 22]. The increase of Th17 in MM
patients may be caused by the increased proinflammatory
cytokines, and eventually lead to Th17 polarization in
MM milieu. Th17 expansion along with increased related
cytokines suppressed immune responses, protected
myeloma cells from CTL attack, and promoted their
survival and growth [17]. In our study, Th17 increased in
ND, NR or RP MM patients, and reduced after achieving
complete remission. Similar to Th22, Th17 was also
correlated with tumor stage, which was consistent with
Shen’s study [11]. These suggested that measurement of
Th17 frequency might be related to tumor burden and may
be useful in evaluating therapeutic effect.

Th17 cells remained significantly higher in stage III patients compared with that in stage I+II patients or healthy controls. (B) Circulating

IL-17 cytokines, IL-17A to IL-17F, are emerging as
critical players in host defense responses and inflammatory
diseases. Th17 is the predominant cell-type to produce IL17A and IL-17F, while there are still other multiple cell
types expressing IL-17A [23]. In our study, in line with the
increased Th17 cells, plasma IL-17A was elevated in ND
patients and reduced after achieving CR. The increased
IL-17A along with elevated Th17 in the current study
may contribute to the pathogenesis of MM. As for RORC
expression, no statistical difference was found between
MM patients and controls, which may be because we
detected the expression of RORC in the total lymphocytes
rather than CD4+ T cells.
In our study, there existed a positive correlation
between peripheral Th22 and Th17 subset in ND MM
patients, implying that differentiation of Th22 and Th17
may be induced in an influential manner in MM. This coelevated frequency of Th22 and Th17 suggested that these
two Th subsets may play a synergistic role in leading to
a dramatic increase in the over-exuberant inflammatory
immune reaction in MM patients.
Numerous evidences suggest Th1 cells have been
linked to the development of autoimmune inflammatory
processes [14]. Regarding the specific roles of Th1
and related cytokines IFN-γ in MM, the results were
controversial. One study reported decreased Th1 responses
with IFN-γ production [24, 25], while another report found
that the levels of Th1 and IFN-γ were significantly higher
in ND MM patients than controls [22]. However, our
results were in disagreement with those above observation
of decreased or increased Th1 responses in MM patients.
In contrast to the results of Th22 and Th17, no statistical
difference was shown in Th1 between patients with MM
and controls. Meanwhile, statistical correlation between
Th1 and Th22 or Th17 was not found in this study.
In conclusion, our study revealed for the first time
that the proportion of Th22 and Th17 was increased in
patients with MM. Moreover, there exited a significantly
positive correlation between Th22 and Th17. In addition,
there was a significant relationship between the proportion
of Th22 or Th17 cells and clinical tumor stage. Taken
together, our results indicate that Th22 and Th17 cells may
represent important potential immunotherapeutic targets in
MM. Further researches including in vitro or animal model
studies are needed to understand their detailed roles in the
pathobiology of MM.

diagnosis of multiple myeloma was based on the
International Myeloma Working Group criteria [26]. The
patients were classified according to the international
staging system for multiple myeloma [27]. The patients
were divided into four groups: 16 newly-diagnosed
(ND) patients (3 females and 13 males; median age,
63; range, 40–80 years), 20 complete remission (CR)
patients (10 females and 10 males; median age, 65;
range, 37–72 years), 10 non-remission (NR) patients (4
females and 6 males; median age, 51; range, 40–80 years)
and 9 relapsed-refractory (RP) patients (2 females and 7
males; media age, 57; range, 42–74 years). Twenty-three
healthy PB donors (9 females and 14 males; median age,
43; range, 32-59 years) were also included in the study.
Ten hematological normal BM transplant donors (3
females, 7 males; median age, 45; range, 36-55 years)
were used as BM controls. In our study, CR is deﬁned as
conﬁrmed negative immunoﬁxation of serum and urine,
and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and
plasma cells ≤5% in bone marrow. The criteria to define
CR also include normal free light chain (FLC). This study
was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Qilu
Hospital, Shandong University, China. Informed consent
was obtained from all patients before enrollment in the
study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Treatment regimen
Newly-diagnosed MM patients were treated with
21-day cycles of bortezomib/ thalidomide/dexamethasone
(BTD) chemotherapy regimens: bortezomib 1.3mg/m2 on
days 1, 4, 8, and 11 by subcutaneous injection, thalidomide
200mg/day given orally and dexamethasone 20 mg on
days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 via intravenous infusion.

Flow cytometric analysis of Th22, Th17 and Th1
cells
Intracellular cytokines were studied by flow
cytometry to reflex the cytokine-producing cells. Briefly,
heparinized whole blood (100 μl) with an equal volume of
Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium
was incubated for 4 h at 37oC in 5% CO2 in the presence
of 2.5 ng/ml of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), 1mg/
ml of ionomycin, and 1.7mg/ml of monensin (all from
Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA, USA). PMA and
ionomycin are pharmacologic T-cell activating agents
that mimic signals generated by the T-cell receptor (TCR)
complex and have the advantage of stimulating T cells
of any antigen specificity. Monensin is used to block the
intracellular transport mechanisms, thereby leading to an
accumulation of cytokines in the cells. After incubation,
the cells were stained with PE-CY5 conjugated antihuman CD4 monoclonal antibody at room temperature
in the dark for 20 min. The cells were next stained with

analyzed the proportion of pure Th17 cells (CD4+ IFNγ-IL-17A+IL-22- T cells), pure Th22 cells (CD4+IFN-γIL-22+ IL-17A- T cells) as well as Th1 cells (CD4+IFN-γ+
T cells) in CD4+ lymphocytes.

of cytokines. The levels of IL-22 (Cat: BMS2047), IL17A (Cat: BMS2017) and IFN-γ (Cat: BMS228) were
measured by ELISA following the manufacturer’s
instructions (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). The lower
detection limits were as follows: IFN-γ, 0.99pg/ml; IL17A, 0.5 pg/ml; IL-22, 5 pg/ml.

Statistical analysis
All of the data were given as mean ± SD or median
(range). Statistical significance of Th22, Th17 and
Th1 cells, and plasma IL-22, IL-17A as well as IFN-γ
among MM patients in different groups was determined
by ANOVA, and difference between two groups was
determined by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test
(q test) unless the data were not normally distributed,
in which case Kruskal-Wallis test (H test) and Nemenyi
test were used. The Pearson or Spearman correlation
test was used for correlation analysis depending on data
distribution. All tests were performed by SPSS 17.0
system. P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Determination of the expression of RORC and
AHR
The total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Approximately, 1 μg of total RNA from each
sample was used to synthesize cDNA with Prime Script
RT reagent Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Dalian, China). Reverse
transcription reaction was done at 37 °C for 15 min,
followed by 85 °C for 5 s. Real-time quantitative PCR
was conducted using an ABI Prism 7500 Real-time PCR
system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in
accordance to the manufacturer’s instructions. The realtime PCR contained, in a final volume of 10 μl, 5 μl of
2× SYBR Green Real-time PCR Master Mix, 1 μl of
cDNA, 3.2 μl of ddH2O and 0.4 μl of the forward and
reverse primers. The primers were shown as follows:
RORC Forward 5’-CAA TGG AAG TGG TGC TGG TTA
G-3’, Reverse 5’-GGG AGT GGG AGA AGT CAA AGA
T-3’; AHR Forward 5’-CAA ATC CTT CCA AGC GGC
ATA-3’, Reverse 5’-CGC TGA GCC TAA GAA CTG
AAA G-3’. All experiments were conducted in triplicate.
The PCR products were analyzed by melt curve analysis
and agarose gel electrophoresis to determine product
size and to confirm that no by-product was formed. The
results were expressed relative to the number of GAPDH
transcripts used as an internal control. GAPDH was
analyzed using the following primers: Forward 5’-GCT
CTC TGC TCC TCC TGT TC-3’, Reverse 5’-GTT GAC
TCC GAC CTT CAC CT- 3’. Relative gene expression
level (the amount of target, normalized to endogenous
control gene) was calculated using the comparative Ct
method formula 2 –ΔCt.
