Abstract
Ampliﬁcation of the transcription factor MYCN is associated with poor outcome and a multidrug-resistant
phenotype in neuroblastoma. N-Myc regulates the expression of several ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
genes, thus affecting global drug efﬂux. Because these transporters do not confer resistance to several important
cytotoxic agents used to treat neuroblastoma, we explored the prognostic signiﬁcance and transcriptional
regulation of the phase II detoxifying enzyme, glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1). Using quantitative real-time
PCR, GSTP1 gene expression was assessed in a retrospective cohort of 51 patients and subsequently in a cohort of
207 prospectively accrued primary neuroblastomas. These data along with GSTP1 expression data from an
independent microarray study of 251 neuroblastoma samples were correlated with established prognostic
indicators and disease outcome. High levels of GSTP1 were associated with decreased event-free and overall
survival in all three cohorts. Multivariable analyses, including age at diagnosis, tumor stage, and MYCN
ampliﬁcation status, were conducted on the two larger cohorts, independently showing the prognostic
signiﬁcance of GSTP1 expression levels in this setting. Mechanistic investigations revealed that GSTP1 is a
direct transcriptional target of N-Myc in neuroblastoma cells. Together, our ﬁndings reveal that N-Myc regulates
GSTP1 along with ABC transporters that act to control drug metabolism and efﬂux. Furthermore, they imply that
strategies to jointly alter these key multidrug resistance mechanisms may have therapeutic implications to
manage neuroblastomas and other malignancies driven by ampliﬁed Myc family genes. Cancer Res; 72(4); 845–53.

Introduction
Neuroblastoma is a solid tumor of embryonal neural crest
origin and is the most common extracranial solid tumor of
early childhood, accounting for 15% of all cancer related deaths
in children (1). Patients diagnosed over one year of age often
have disseminated, metastatic disease, often with MYCN
ampliﬁcation. While neuroblastomas typically respond to initial therapy regardless of risk group (2), the majority of patients
with high-risk disease relapse with tumors that are refractory
to treatment. There are no salvage regimens known to be
curative for these patients (3). We have previously shown that
the ATP-binding cassette transporter C1 (ABCC1), a key component of phase III detoxiﬁcation, is a powerful independent
prognostic marker in neuroblastoma (4, 5). Consistent with
this observation, ABCC1 is able to efﬂux a wide range of
chemotherapeutics (6), including many agents of importance
in neuroblastoma therapy. However, several important chemotherapeutic agents to which resistance is observed, including cisplatin and cyclophosphamide, are not substrates of
ABCC1. Amongst the well-characterized contributors to multidrug resistance in other types of tumors are cellular

detoxiﬁcation pathways. In particular, the phase II conjugating
enzyme glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) is upregulated in
a wide range of tumors and high GSTP1 expression is often
associated with multidrug resistance (7–9). GSTP1 catalyses
the conjugation of reduced glutathione to otherwise harmful
electrophilic compounds, including cytotoxic drugs, and can
sequester a range of nonsubstrate ligands (10). In addition to
these roles, GSTP1 has been proposed to inhibit the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway through direct
interaction with c-jun-NH2-kinase 1 (JNK1), decreasing sensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis (11). We have, therefore,
extended our studies to investigate the prognostic value of
this gene in neuroblastoma.
Here, we show that GSTP1 expression is an independent
prognostic indicator of clinical outcome in primary neuroblastoma and, like ABCC1, is a direct transcriptional target of the NMyc oncoprotein. The regulation of multiple components of
drug metabolism pathways has implications for understanding
drug insensitivity in patients with neuroblastoma with MYCN
ampliﬁcation and potentially in other malignancies with
increased expression of Myc family proteins.

Materials and Methods
Patient tumor samples
All patient material used for gene expression analyses has
been previously described (5, 12). In brief, a small discovery
cohort of 51 primary tumors from previously untreated
patients was obtained from either the Sydney Children's
Hospital, Sydney, Australia or the Neuroblastoma Tumor
Bank of the Pediatric Oncology Group, USA ("SCH/POG"
cohort; ref. 12) and a large validation cohort of 207 patients
enrolled onto COG Neuroblastoma Biology Study 9047 was
obtained from the Tumor Bank of the Children's Oncology
Group, USA ("COG" cohort; ref. 5). The study was approved
by the individual Institutional Review Boards, and informed
consent was obtained for patients registered on the study.
Publicly available data for GSTP1 expression from a customized oligonucleotide microarray data set of primary tumors
from 251 patients with neuroblastoma from the German
Neuroblastoma Trials NB90-NB2004 were also analyzed as a
second independent validation cohort ("Oberthuer cohort";
GSTP1 probe ¼ A_23_P202658). The patient cohort and
microarray study are previously published (13). A summary
of patient data for each cohort is provided as Supplementary
Tables S1–S3.

When medium palpable tumors (1 cm2) were detected, they
were resected, measured, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for
subsequent analysis. All experimental procedures were
approved by the University of New South Wales Animal Care
and Ethics Committee and were conducted under the Animal
Research Act, 1985 (NSW, Australia) and the Australian Code
of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientiﬁc
Purposes (1997).
Real-time PCR methods
For tumor samples, total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated
from human and mouse tumor material using a guanidinium
thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (4) and
cDNAs were synthesized from 1 mg of RNA using random
hexanucleotide primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus
(MMLV) reverse transcriptase. Gene expression was determined by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) using either a Prism 7700
or 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems)
with the following oligonucleotide primers and probes:
human GSTP1, b-2 microglobulin (B2M) and MYCN and
mouse Gstp1, Gstp2 (the 2 mouse genes corresponding to
human GSTP1) and B2m. All sequences are shown in Supplementary Table S4.
For cell lines, RNA samples were prepared with Tri-Reagent
(Sigma-Aldrich) and treated with DNase (DNAfree; Ambion).
Reverse transcription and PCR were conducted by a SuperScript reverse transcription-PCR kit (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was
carried out with iQ SYBR Green Supermix and the iQCycler
thermocycler (BioRad) with primers and probes for human
MYCN, GSTP1, NUC, and GUSB. All sequences are shown in
Supplementary Table S4.
Gene expression levels were determined using the DDCt
method, normalized to the B2M control, and expressed relative
to a calibrator (18).

Treatment
Treatments subsequently administered to patients were
speciﬁc to their disease stage, age, and tumor biology and
have been previously described for each of the SCH/POG (4),
COG (5), and Oberthuer cohorts (14).

Western blot analysis
Frozen tissue (50 mg) was pulverized on dry ice with a
mortar and pestle in 500 mL lysis buffer (2 PBS, 1% NP-40,
0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing a
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were
centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a benchtop centrifuge and the
supernatants retained and quantitated by BCA assay (Pierce).
Samples (20 mg) were electrophoresed on a 4% to 20% SDSPAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (GE
Healthcare). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk
powder in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, then
incubated with an anti-GSTP1 antibody (mouse monoclonal
3F2C2, Abcam) followed by a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody. Membranes were developed with
Supersignal reagent (Pierce), visualized on ﬁlm and quantitated relative to a-tubulin by densitometry with QuantityOne
software (BioRad).

TH-MYCN mouse tumor samples
The TH-MYCN transgenic mouse model of neuroblastoma,
which has the expression of the human MYCN oncogene
targeted to mouse neuroectodermal cells via the rat tyrosine
hydroxylase promoter, has been previously described (15–17).

Human neuroblastoma cell lines and culture
SH-EP Tet-21N cells (19) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated tetracycline-free FBS, whereas BE(2)-C and LA-N-5 cells were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 20% FBS and

50 mg/mL gentamycin. For MYCN repression, SH-EP Tet-21N
cells were treated with 2 mg/mL tetracycline for the indicated
time. Cell lines were obtained from: Manfred Schwab (SH-EP
Tet-21N), German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell
Cultures BE(2)-C, and Deborah Tweddle (LA-N-5) between
1997 and 2005 and were systematically validated for MYCN
copy number and expression of speciﬁc markers such as
MYCN, upon receipt and during usage by Dr. Giuliano Della
Valle who runs the cytogenetic facility, Department of Biology,
University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
The promoter region of GSTP1 was analyzed using bioinformatics techniques to identify putative N-Myc–binding sites,
including the canonical E-box sequence CACGTG and other
noncanonical sequences such as CATGTG and CACGCG.
Promoter regions from 2,000 to þ2,000 base pairs with
respect to the transcription start site were considered for
analysis. To test binding of N-Myc, quantitative chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was carried out as previously
described (20, 21) using either SH-EP Tet-21N cells cultured
in the absence of tetracycline (presence of N-Myc), BE(2)-C, or
LA-N-5 cells. Antibodies used in this study were: IgG (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology; sc-2027); N-Myc monoclonal antibody
B8.4.B (22), and Max C-17 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc197). Speciﬁc pairs of primers used for quantitative ChIP are
listed in Supplementary Table S5.

Statistical analysis
The relationship between levels of target gene expression
and patient survival was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier
method with curves analyzed by log-rank test. Standard
errors were calculated according to the method of Peto and
Peto (23). Comparisons of outcome between subgroups in
multivariable analyses were conducted using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The relationship
between levels of target gene expression was analyzed
using the Spearman rank correlation. Differences in target
gene expression between samples were assessed using a 2sided Student t test. Statistical analyses were conducted
using either Stata (StataCorp) or SPSS (IBM). Event-free
survival (EFS) time was calculated from the time of enrolment onto the relevant study, or from diagnosis (SCH
samples), to the time of the ﬁrst occurrence of an event
(relapse, progressive disease, secondary malignancy, or
death) or to the date of last contact if no event occurred.
Death was the only event considered for the calculation of
overall survival time. All samples were deidentiﬁed, and
researchers who conducted the gene expression analysis
were blinded to all clinical characteristics and outcome of
the subjects.
Tumors were categorized as having high expression of
GSTP1 based on a range of cutoff points, including the
median, upper quartile, and upper decile PCR values. The
statistical methodology used to identify the optimal cutoff

Results
Prognostic signiﬁcance of GSTP1 in primary human
neuroblastoma
To assess the prognostic signiﬁcance of GSTP1 expression
in neuroblastoma, we initially used RT-PCR to analyze its
expression in a small cohort of 51 primary untreated tumors.
When patients were dichotomized around the median RTPCR value, high expression of GSTP1 was signiﬁcantly associated with poorer EFS (P ¼ 0.002, Fig. 1A) with 5-year
survival rates of 92%  5.4% and 51%  11% for tumors with
low and high GSTP1 expression, respectively, and also signiﬁcantly associated with poorer overall survival (P ¼
0.006, Fig. 1B), with 5-year survival rates of 96%  3.9% and
63%  10% for tumors with low and high GSTP1 expression,
respectively. Furthermore, GSTP1 expression was signiﬁcantly higher in tumors with MYCN ampliﬁcation than in
nonampliﬁed tumors (Fig. 1C, P ¼ 0.024). To verify that

GSTP1 gene expression accurately reﬂected expression at the
protein level, we conducted Western blotting on 6 representative tumor samples, 3 with high GSTP1 gene expression
and 3 with low gene expression (Fig. 1D). Protein levels were
found to correlate strongly with gene expression in these
samples (Fig. 1E; r ¼ 0.96, P ¼ 0.002). Full-length Western
blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. S1.
Next, we extended these observations to 2 large patient
cohorts. In the ﬁrst, we analyzed GSTP1 expression by RT-PCR
in 207 primary tumors (COG cohort). In the second, we
analyzed publicly available microarray data (13) for GSTP1
expression in 251 primary tumors (Oberthuer cohort).
In the COG cohort, high GSTP1 expression was associated
with worse outcome when patients were dichotomized around
either the median or upper quartile RT-PCR values, although
this failed to reach statistical signiﬁcance at these cutoff points
(not shown). However, at the upper decile, high GSTP1 expression was signiﬁcantly associated with reduced EFS (P ¼
0.002; Fig. 2A). The 5-year EFS rate for patients with high
GSTP1 expression was 52%  11% compared with 75%  3.3%
for low GSTP1 expression. The prognostic signiﬁcance of
GSTP1 was also examined for patients with tumors lacking

NOTE: Variables adjusted for in the multivariable analysis included tumor stage (1, 2, and 4S vs. 3, 4), age at diagnosis (<12 months

MYCN ampliﬁcation. While these patients would be expected
to have a relatively favorable outcome compared with patients
with MYCN ampliﬁcation, high levels of GSTP1 expression
remained predictive of poorer outcome with a 5-year EFS rate
of 60%  13% compared with 80%  3% for patients with low
GSTP1 expression in their tumors (P ¼ 0.025; Fig. 2B). Similarly,
within poor prognosis patients (INSS stage 3 and 4), high levels
of GSTP1 expression identiﬁed a subset with particularly poor
outcome and a 5-year EFS rate of only 31%  14% compared
with 52%  6% for patients with low GSTP1 expression (P ¼
0.022; Fig. 2C). In each case, similar effects were observed for
overall survival (not shown).
Within the Oberthuer cohort, GSTP1 was strongly associated
with EFS at the upper decile (P < 0.001; Fig. 2D) and also at the
upper quartile and median (not shown). At the upper decile,
the 5-year EFS rates for patients with high GSTP1 expression
were 24%  13% compared with 74%  3% for low GSTP1
expression. In patients with tumors lacking MYCN ampliﬁcation, 5-year EFS rates were 26%  20% and 78%  3% for those
with high and low GSTP1 expression, respectively (P < 0.001, Fig.
2E). For those with poor prognosis (stage 3 and 4), high GSTP1
expression was associated with signiﬁcantly worse outcome
with 5-year EFS rates of 15%  12% and 55%  6% for high and
low GSTP1 expression, respectively (P ¼ 0.007; Fig. 2F). Within
the stage 4 patients only, EFS was not signiﬁcantly different for
those with low and high GSTP1 expression in their tumors (P ¼
0.227), however, overall survival rates retained signiﬁcance (P
¼ 0.049) with 5-year survival rates of 51%  8.5% and 37% 
14% for high and low GSTP1 expression, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Multivariable analysis was conducted to determine whether
GSTP1 expression had prognostic signiﬁcance independent of
established prognostic indicators for neuroblastoma. Tumor
stage (1, 2, or 4S vs. 3 or 4), age at diagnosis (<12 months vs. 12
months), MYCN status (ampliﬁed vs. single copy), and dichotomized GSTP1 expression were tested in a Cox proportional
hazards model (Table 1). In the COG cohort, GSTP1 expression

www.aacrjournals.org

retained independent prognostic signiﬁcance for EFS [HR ¼
2.6; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 1.2–5.5; P ¼ 0.011] and overall
survival (HR ¼ 2.21; 95% CI 1.0–4.8; P ¼ 0.047). Likewise in the
Oberthuer cohort, GSTP1 expression retained prognostic signiﬁcance for both EFS (relative risk ¼ 2.0; 95% CI 1.1–3.8; P ¼
0.029) and overall survival (relative risk ¼ 2.3; 95% CI 1.1–4.9;
P ¼ 0.024). Finally, in a multivariable analysis for stage 4
patients only, including GSTP1 expression and age, GSTP1
expression approached signiﬁcance for overall survival (relative risk ¼ 2.1; 95% CI 0.99–4.6; P ¼ 0.054), but was not
signiﬁcant for EFS (Supplementary Table S6).
Expression of GSTP1 correlates with MYCN in
neuroblastoma tumors
As ampliﬁcation of the transcription factor MYCN is a common feature of poor outcome in neuroblastoma, and GSTP1
expression was higher in MYCN-ampliﬁed tumors than in those
without MYCN ampliﬁcation (Fig. 1C), we sought to determine
whether GSTP1 expression was regulated by MYCN. First, we
assessed the correlation between GSTP1 expression and MYCN
expression in the COG cohort after conducting RT-PCR analysis
to determine relative MYCN expression levels. Using the Spearman rank correlation, GSTP1 levels were found to correlate with
MYCN expression in both tumors with MYCN ampliﬁcation (r ¼
0.61, P ¼ 0.003; Fig. 3A) and those without (r ¼ 0.73, P < 0.001; Fig.
3B). We also extended this analysis to the TH-MYCN transgenic
mouse model of neuroblastoma (15), where the human MYCN
transgene is expressed in cells of neuroectodermal origin by use
of a tyrosine hydroxylase promoter. Using RT-PCR analysis,
MYCN levels were found to correlate particularly closely with
the expression of mouse Gstp1 (r ¼ 0.91, P < 0.001; Fig. 3C).
Similar results were observed for Gstp2 (not shown). Finally, we
assessed the expression of GSTP1 using RT-PCR at various time
points after tetracycline-induced suppression of exogenous
MYCN expression in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-EP Tet21N (19). GSTP1 expression was decreased after tetracycline
exposure, along with MYCN (not shown).

Figure 3. GSTP1 gene expression correlates with that of MYCN.
Expression of GSTP1 correlates with that of MYCN in tumors from the
COG cohort either with MYCN ampliﬁcation (A), or without (B), whereas
Gstp1 expression correlates with that of the MYCN transgene in tumors
from the TH-MYCN mouse neuroblastoma model (C). The relationships
were analyzed using the Spearman rank correlation.

Collectively, these data support regulation of GSTP1 expression by N-Myc in cultured neuroblastoma cell lines, human
neuroblastoma tumors, and tumors from a biologically relevant mouse model of neuroblastoma.
N-Myc directly regulates GSTP1 expression
In light of these results, we assessed whether N-Myc
directly regulates GSTP1 expression. The promoter region

850

of GSTP1 was examined bioinformatically for putative NMyc–binding sites within 2,000 bp on either side of the
transcriptional start site. Two canonical (CACGTG) and 4
noncanonical (CACGCG, CATGTG) E-box sites were identiﬁed over 5 distinct regions of the promoter (Fig. 4A). Next,
we used ChIP assays to examine the physical association of
N-Myc with each of the identiﬁed regions using the 3
independent human neuroblastoma cell lines SH-EP Tet21N, LA-N-5, and BE(2)-C. In each cell line, the GSTP1
promoter was directly bound by N-Myc, as well as its
dimerization partner Max, at a noncanonical E-box proximal
to the putative transcriptional start site (Fig. 4A). The fold
enrichment for GSTP1 was comparable with that of APEX1,
a well-known N-Myc target gene (25) indicating that the
N-Myc/Max complex is strongly bound to the promoter.
Finally, to determine whether N-Myc directly activates
GSTP1 transcription, we cloned the GSTP1 promoter upstream
of a luciferase reporter gene and tested activity in SH-EP Tet21N cells as a function of N-Myc expression. Luciferase activity
was found to be dependent on N-Myc expression for the GSTP1
reporter construct, as for ABCC1, a positive control (26; Fig.
4B). Together, these data show that GSTP1 is a direct transcriptional target of N-Myc in neuroblastoma cells.

Cancer Res; 72(4) February 15, 2012

Using 3 independent patient cohorts, we have shown that
high expression of GSTP1 is a marker of poor prognosis in
primary neuroblastoma. Furthermore, when included in multivariable analyses with the established prognostic indicators
of age at diagnosis, MYCN ampliﬁcation status and tumor
stage as variables, GSTP1 expression retained independent
prognostic signiﬁcance. This result raises the possibility that
GSTP1 contributes to the clinical behavior of neuroblastoma,
consistent with its known roles in drug resistance and tumor
biology. Whereas neuroblastomas typically respond to initial
therapy regardless of risk group (2), the majority of patients
with high-risk disease relapse with tumors that are refractory
to treatment. It is as yet unclear whether this reﬂects the
acquisition of multidrug resistance following exposure to
chemotherapy, as a result of induction of one or more of the
mechanisms which have previously been implicated as mediating multidrug resistance in neuroblastoma, such as MRP1
overexpression (5) or p53 mutation (27), or the selection and
expansion of preexistent multidrug resistant tumor clones, as
we have previously described for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (28). Future studies involving matched pairs of pre- and
posttreatment tumor samples would be valuable to determine
whether levels of GSTP1 or other drug resistance–associated
genes are elevated at relapse compared with levels at the time
of diagnosis.
We also provide evidence that GSTP1 is a direct transcriptional target of N-Myc. First, expression of GSTP1 correlates
with that of MYCN in both human tumors and the tumors
derived from the TH-MYCN mouse neuroblastoma model.
Second, the N-Myc protein, in complex with its dimerization
partner Max, directly interacts with a noncanonical E-box
proximal to the putative transcriptional start site of GSTP1.

Expression and Regulation of GSTP1 in Neuroblastoma

Figure 4. GSTP1 is a direct transcriptional target of N-Myc. A, N-Myc associates with the GSTP1 promoter. Quantitative ChIP was applied to the
neuroblastoma cell lines BE(2)-C, LA-N-5, and SH-EP Tet21N cells expressing MYCN. Relative enrichment is compared with the preimmune serum. The
results represent the mean SE of 5 independent ChIP experiments in which each region was ampliﬁed by RT-PCR in triplicate. Bent arrow, transcription start
site; gray arrow, canonical E-box; black arrow, noncanonical E-box; and black boxes, amplicons. The chromosome and coordinates (bp) are also
given. Quantitative ChIP for APEX1 in BE(2)-C cells is also shown. B, N-Myc regulates GSTP1 in a luciferase reporter assay. Fireﬂy luciferase activity
was determined following transient transfection of either a GSTP1 or ABCC1 reporter construct into SH-EP Tet21N cells. Cells were either not treated
(NT; MYCN ON) or treated with tetracycline for 24 or 48 hours (TET 24 h or TET 48 h; MYCN OFF). Cloned regions are shown at left, with bent arrows
denoting the transcription start site, the cloned DNA region (bp) indicated below the promoter map and fragment coordinates expressed relative to the
transcription start point. The results are the means of the relative ﬂuorescence units (RFU)  SE of 3 independent transfections.

Finally, repression of MYCN expression reduces activity in a
luminescent reporter assay using the GSTP1 promoter. Notably, both the multidrug transporter ABCC1, a phase III detoxiﬁcation component that can efﬂux a number of glutathione-

www.aacrjournals.org

conjugated chemotherapeutic agents (29) and ABCC4, which
can efﬂux both irinotecan and topotecan (12), are also independently prognostic of neuroblastoma outcome (4, 5, 12, 30)
as well as directly regulated by N-Myc (26). MYCN ampliﬁcation

Fletcher et al.

can, therefore, contribute to multidrug resistance in neuroblastoma through the upregulation of a suite of drug resistance
genes covering a range of chemotherapeutic drugs. While
previous in vitro studies suggest cooperativity between ABCC1
and GSTs (31, 32), GSTP1 has a relatively weak afﬁnity for many
anticancer drugs (7), implying that these proteins do not
necessarily form sequential steps for the detoxiﬁcation of a
particular drug.
It is notable that of the 2 cohorts analyzed by RT-PCR, GSTP1
expression was signiﬁcantly associated with poor outcome
when dichotomized around the median RT-PCR value in the
initial SCH/POG 51 sample cohort, whereas in the larger COG
cohort, the association between high GSTP1 expression and
poor outcome was evident but not signiﬁcant at this cutoff point
and in fact did not achieve prognostic signiﬁcance until the data
were dichotomized around the upper decile RT-PCR value. One
contributing factor for this difference is most likely due to the
differences between the patient characteristics of the 2 cohorts.
Speciﬁcally, in the retrospectively accrued SCH/POG cohort of
51 tumors, 23.5% of tumors were MYCN ampliﬁed and 55% were
INSS stage 3 or 4 (12), whilst in the prospectively accrued COG
cohort (5), only 10.1% of tumors were MYCN ampliﬁed and 42%
were INSS stage 3 or 4. The underrepresentation of MYCN
ampliﬁed, advanced stage tumors in the COG cohort can be
related to the frequent diagnosis of stage 4 disease based on
bone marrow sampling rather than tumor biopsy in that cohort,
as we have previously described (5). As GSTP1 is transcriptionally regulated by N-Myc, and given the strong correlation
between MYCN ampliﬁcation and GSTP1 overexpression, it is,
therefore, not surprising that GSTP1 expression is more predictive of outcome in a cohort with a higher proportion of MYCNampliﬁed tumors and less predictive in a cohort where MYCNampliﬁed tumors are underrepresented. Indeed, those MYCN
ampliﬁed patients lost to the COG cohort would most likely only
further strengthen the association between high GSTP1 expression and poor patient outcome evident in that cohort. The
distributions of RT-PCR values for each cohort are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S3.
The identiﬁcation of GSTP1 as an N-Myc target gene also has
importance for malignancies with high expression or ampliﬁcation of c-Myc. N-Myc and c-Myc share a common set of
target genes and are functionally interchangeable in the mouse
(33). Furthermore, GSTP1 was one of a large number of genes
identiﬁed as potential c-Myc transcriptional targets in a highthroughput ChIP study (25) and GSTP1 is transcriptionally
regulated by c-Myc in osteosarcoma cell lines (G. Perini,
manuscript in preparation). Finally, as Gstp1 is tightly coupled
to MYCN expression in neuroblastomas arising in TH-MYCN
mice, this is likely to be a suitable preclinical model in which to
assess the efﬁcacy of GSTP1 inhibitors.

While the most familiar role for GSTP1 is the conjugation
of reduced glutathione to cytotoxic drugs, GSTP1 may
possess other functions that contribute to chemoresistance,
including inhibition of JNK1 (34) and activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK; ref. 35). In addition to
potential roles in mediating drug resistance in neuroblastoma, GSTP1 could potentially impact other tumor properties through its ability to conjugate the cyclopentenone
prostaglandins 15d-D12,14-PGJ2 and PGA2 (36), leading to
their export through ABCC1 and ABCC3 (37) and its ability
to sequester 15d-D12,14-PGJ2 in the cytosol independently of
conjugation (38). Both mechanisms may prevent cyclopentenone prostaglandins from binding to the nuclear localized
gamma isoform of the peroxisome proliferator–activated
receptor (PPAR-g), activation of which is antiproliferative,
prodifferentiation, and proapoptotic (39) in cancer cells. In
neuroblastoma, activation of PPAR-g by 15d-D12,14-PGJ2 has
been shown to induce apoptosis (40) and differentiation (41).
While we cannot exclude these additional functions in our
experiments, analysis of microarray data available for the
Oberthuer cohort did not reveal any evidence of an association between GSTP1 expression and that of JNK1 (MAPK8),
ERK1 (MAPK1) or PPARg (PPARG; Supplementary Fig. S4), or
with pathways associated with these genes (data not shown).
GSTP1 is upregulated in numerous human tumors and high
GSTP1 expression is associated with chemoresistance (7–9). To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to reveal the prognostic
signiﬁcance of GSTP1 expression in neuroblastoma and the
ﬁrst to show that GSTP1 is a direct transcriptional target of the
MYCN oncogene, which is frequently ampliﬁed in poor outcome neuroblastoma. These observations have signiﬁcance
both for MYCN-ampliﬁed neuroblastoma and for other diseases with ampliﬁcation of Myc family oncogenes.
