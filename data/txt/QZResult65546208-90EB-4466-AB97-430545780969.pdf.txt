Abstract
Targeting the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and ubiquitin-like signalling
systems (UBL) has been considered a promising therapeutic strategy to treat cancer,
neurodegenerative and immunological disorders. There have been multiple efforts
recently to identify novel compounds that efficiently modulate the activities of
different disease-specific components of the UPS-UBL. However, it is evident that
polypharmacology (the ability to affect multiple independent protein targets) is a basic
property of small molecules and even highly potent molecules would have a number
of “off target” effects. Here we have explored publicly available high-throughput
screening data covering a wide spectrum of currently accepted drug targets in order
to understand polypharmacology of small molecules targeting different components
of the UPS-UBL. We have demonstrated that molecules targeting a given UPS-UBL
protein also have high odds to target a given off target spectrum. Moreover, the off
target spectrum differs significantly between different components of UPS-UBL. This
information can be utilized further in drug discovery efforts, to improve drug efficiency
and to reduce the risk of potential side effects of the prospective drugs designed to
target specific UPS-UBL components.

Introduction

of the targeted protein (the case of polyubiquitination)
[5]. Our current understanding, however, is much
wider: there are diverse, nondegradative functions of
protein ubiquitylation including the regulation of DNA
repair,transcription, mRNA metabolism and splicing
[1, 6-10]. Moreover, the 26S proteasome is subject to
ubiquitination by itself, which affects its activity [11].
In addition, protein ubiquitylation is regulated tightly by
complex mechanisms and is a reversible process: ubiquitin
molecules can be removed by deubiquitylating enzymes
(DUBs) [12].
Recently a number of regulatory cascades very
similar to UPS have been discovered, the ubiquitin like
modifiers (UBL) [13, 14]. By marking proteins with
ubiquitin-like conjugates, the cell regulates activity
of multiple downstream proteins and, thus, controls
many important regulatory pathways. The structure of
enzymological reactions that are involved in protein

The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) is essential
for the turnover and biological function of most proteins
[1-3]. In short, ubiquitin is a protein with 76 amino acids,
which is activated in an ATP-dependent manner by a
ubiquitin-activating enzyme commonly referred to as E1.
In the next step ubiquitin is transferred by an ubiquitinconjugating enzyme (commonly referred to as E2) that,
together with an ubiquitin-protein ligase (commonly
referred to as E3), specifically attaches ubiquitin to a target
protein through the amino group of a lysine residue [4].
The targeted protein can be polyubiquitylated (the addition
of several ubiquitins to a single lysine residue in a protein)
or multiubiquitylated (addition of single or several
ubiquitin(s) to several lysines in one protein). Initially,
protein ubiquitylation was considered only in the context
of signalling for 26S proteasome-mediated degradation

modifications by ubiquitylation is analogous to that
used by ubiquitin-like cascades. One of the best studied
ubiquitin-like proteins is small ubiquitin-related modifiers
SUMO [15]. The conjugation of SUMO to target proteins
regulates cell-cycle control, nuclear transport and the
response to viral infections [16]. Three SUMO isoforms
are currently known in man with functionally distinct
roles. At present, about a dozen different ubiquitin-like
cascades have been described with varying degrees of
completeness [17].
Destabilization of the normal UPS function as well
as defects in functionality of UBL signalling cascades
have been shown to be linked to multiple pathological
conditions such as cancer and neurodegenerative
disorders [17, 18]. Although our understanding of the
role of the UPS-UBL in various complex diseases is far
from complete, there are examples of successful drug
developments targeting the system. Bortezomib is the
first drug targeting the UPS (inhibition of the proteasome)
that was approved by the FDA for treatment of multiple
myeloma in 2003 [19]. The selectivity of proteasome
inhibition for killing tumour versus normal cells (normal
cells also experience some toxic effects due to abnormal
function of the proteasome) by Bortezomib was somewhat
surprising. The commonly accepted explanation for this is
that tumour cells (in particular white blood cells normally
responsible for producing antibodies) have higher
concentrations of aberrant proteins that are constantly
degraded by the UPS making them more sensitive to the
effects of proteasome inhibition [17, 18].
The success of Bortezomib along with our increasing

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

understanding of the UPS-UBL and its potential role in
human diseases has provoked significant interest in the
development of drugs that can target specific components
of the UPS-UBL pathways, thus modifying UPS-UBL
function [18]. The current trend is the development of
compounds targeting specific proteins of the UPS [20].
There have been multiple efforts recently to develop highthroughput screening (HTS) assays to identify drugs that
modulate the activity of different components of ubiquitin
or ubiquitin-like cascades [21-23]. In the public domain,
we were able to find more than a dozen of such HTS (see
Table 1), with each reporting thousands of molecules to
be efficient modulators and, therefore, each reporting
thousands of potential drug leads to act on specific UPS
or UBL components.
The current process of drug discovery and
subsequent (pre-)clinical development involves several
stages; identification of molecules that act on a specific
target is only the first step in this timely process. In
the next step selected drug candidates are subjected to
various tests to investigate potential off targets which
would predefine their specific toxicity or side effects
[24]. On the one hand, selection of many drug candidates
obviously increases the chances to find the one with
optimized safety parameters; on the other hand, testing
many drug candidates towards a whole spectrum of
potential off targets is virtually impossible. At this stage,
it is imperative to introduce some rationale for selecting
potential risk factors (such as defining the most probable
off target effects) and, therefore, to optimize the number
of tests needed. This rationale could be introduced by

mining of publicly available HTS screens covering a wide
spectrum of potential drug targets in various complex
diseases.
In this article we are going to review several
recently published high-throughput screening assays
that aimed to identify potential drug leads targeting
different components of the UPS-UBL (see Table 1).
Furthermore, we provide comparative analyses of these
screens versus the large number (> 1000) of HTS targetoriented screens publicly available in the PubChem
repository. The possibility of such comparison arises
from the lucky coincidence that the chemical libraries
used in most of these screens are very similar, i.e. screens
done independently by different labs with biologically
independent assays (targets) share a significant number of
the same screened molecules. This allows one to compute
for UPS (UBL) targets the cross target correlation versus
the spectrum of other targets available in PubChem: the
odds of molecules to target any protein from the spectrum
if the molecule targets the UPS (UBL). Therefore, for each
UPS (UBL) target we obtain a list of top off targets which
have high odds to be targeted by potential drug leads. We
also provided analyses of discovered top potential off
targets on the subject of drug efficiency and drug safety
issues.

PubChem BioAssay data model, results of HTS target
oriented assays, in simple terms, could be interpreted as
a subset of small molecules reported to inhibit (in rare
cases activate) the targeted protein. The abundance of
this information (> 1000 independent assays) from the
PubChem BioAssay repository could be integrated on a
large scale to derive binding spectra for approximately half
of the million molecules across several hundred proteins.
Many of these molecules have been tested in UPS (UBL)
assays. Let us denote KA to be the number of active
molecules (molecules exhibiting activity in the assay at
relevant concentrations) in the HTS UPS (UBL) assay
and as KB the number of inactive molecules. For each off
target protein “Z” we count the number (kA) of the active
molecules (from the UPS assay) which target “Z” (have
been reported in the other HTS assay as active versus “Z”)
and kB is the number of inactive molecules which target Z.
Odds for the molecules (to be active) targeting “Z” is (kA/
kB) while the same odds for the molecules which do not
target “Z” is ((KA-kA)/(KB-kB)). The odds ratio is (kA/kB)
/ ((KA-kA)/(KB-kB)) and indicates the increase/decrease of
odds for a molecule to target “Z” while targeting the UPSUBL protein. Significance of the odds ratio is computed
using X2- distribution and the adjustment of p-values for
multiple testing (each target one hypothesis) is done using
the FDR procedure [26-29].

UBC13 Polyubiquitin Inhibitors

enzyme which is only active as a heterodimer with another

(UCH37)

E2 enzyme and produces polyubiquitin chains exclusively
linked at lysine residue 63 of ubiquitin. Ubc13 specifically
ubiquitinates Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated
Factors (TRAFs), a family of adapter proteins. Ubc13mediated ubiquitination of TRAFs is recognized as a
critical step in signalling by TNFRs during the innate and
acquired immune responses [30]. Inhibition of Ubc13
is considered as a potential strategy for development of
novel immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory agents as
well as agents for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases
[31]. In vitro high-throughput screening assays based on
the principal of time-resolved fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (TR-FRET) have been developed to
identify potential inhibitors of Ubc13 activity [32].
Terbium-ubiquitin and fluorescein-ubiquitin have been
used to generate a FRET reaction. In total, a library of 328
071 compounds were screened and 1540 were reported as
active (efficiently inhibiting Ubc13 at clinically relevant
concentrations).
The top ten potential off target activities for the
molecules inhibiting Ubc13 are presented in Table 2.
For example, the ability of a molecule to inhibit Ubc13
significantly increases the odds (~ 40 fold) for the
molecule to additionally inhibit APAF1. In total, 2314 (406
+ 1908) molecules which were tested in the Ubc13 screen
demonstrated the potential to inhibit APAF1 and 406 of
them exhibited potent inhibition of Ubc13 while 1908 did
not. Observed odds for a molecule to inhibit Ubc13 in the
screen is ~ 0.006 (1538/ 223822), while observed odds for
the molecules experimentally validated to inhibit APAF1
is approximately 40 times higher ~ 0.21 (406/1908).
Thus, we observe a strong association between Ubc13 and
APAF1: molecules targeting one protein have a reasonable
chance to target the other as an off target.
Recent evidence has implicated the E3 ligase
activity of TRAFs in the pathogenic aggregation of mutant
proteins in neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington
disease [33]. Instead of conventional polyubiquitination,
TRAF6 promotes atypical ubiquitination (with the Ubc13
as the E2) of mutated misfolded proteins and, thereby,
prevents them from degradation [34, 35]. Recently APAF1
dominant negative inhibition was tested for its antiapoptotic effect on degenerating nigrostriatal neurons in
a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
model of Parkinson’s disease and was shown to inhibit
MPTP toxicity [36]. Thus, both Ubc13 and APAF1 are
potential therapeutic targets in Parkinson’s disease but
with different mechanism of action. Our analysis reveals
that Ubc13 and APAF1 are frequently targeted together
by small molecules as observed from the available HTS
screens. This makes the Ubc13 and APAF1 pair an
attractive multitarget for development of therapeutics with
polypharmacological mechanisms of action in Parkinson’s
disease.

Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) represent a group
of cysteine proteases that cleave the isopeptide bond
between ubiquitin and its conjugated proteins [37]. The
HTS assay (PubChem Id 588478) aims to identify small
molecule inhibitors of human UCH37, which is tightly
associated with the proteasome. Specifically, this screen
sought to identify small molecules that inhibit the increase
in fluorescence resulting from the UCH37 mediated
cleavage of a fluorescent substrate, ubiquitin-7-amido-4methylcoumarin (Ub-AMC). In total, a library of 329843
small molecules was screened and 1078 molecules were
reported as active (efficiently inhibiting UCH37 at low
concentration).
The top ten potential off target activities for the
molecules inhibiting UCH37 are presented in Table 3.
For example, the ability of a molecule to inhibit UCH37
significantly increases the odds (~ 30 fold) for the
molecule to inhibit TDP2 (tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase
2). In total, 965 (119 + 846) molecules tested in the assay
have been reported in other HTS screens as efficient
inhibitors of TDP2 and 119 of them demonstrated potent
inhibition of UCH37 in the assay. Observed odds for a
molecule to inhibit UCH37 in the screen is ~ 0.005 (2130/
238331), while observed odds for the molecules known
to inhibit TDP2 is approximately 30 times higher ~ 0.14
(119/846). Thus, we observe strong association between
UCH37 and TDP2: molecules targeting one protein have
a reasonable chance to target the other as an off target.
Human USPs are considered as novel targets
for therapeutic intervention in a number of human
cancers, including prostate, colon and breast cancer as
well as acute lymphoblastic leukemia [38]. TyrosylDNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) is implicated in
topoisomerase-mediated repair of DNA damage. As a drug
target, TDP2 is hypothesized to mediate drug resistance to
topoisomerase II inhibition by etoposide [39]. Therefore,
inhibition of TDP2 is proposed as a promising approach
to overcome intrinsic or acquired resistance to topo IItargeted drug therapy. The observed properties of screened
small molecules to inhibit both targets could be exploited
for the design of multitarget agents. Considering that the
mechanisms of drug action for UCH37 and TDP2 differ
significantly, the potential for drugs targeting both of them
is likely to be more efficient than targeting independent
mechanisms in the cancer cell. Therefore, multi-target
drugs affecting several cancer mechanisms represented
by UCH37 and TDP2 could be more efficient. On the
other hand, TDP2 has been reported to be essential for
normal neural function and is required to maintain normal
levels of several gene transcripts in the mouse brain
during development [40]. Therefore, targeting TDP2 has
increased odds to be associated with neurological side
effects.

inhibition of SUMO1-mediated PPI. Observed odds for a
molecule to inhibit SUMO1-mediated PPI in the screen
is ~ 0.0045 (1091/241605), while observed odds for the
molecules known to inhibit MBD2 is approximately 100
times higher ~ 0.45 (82/176). Thus, we observe a strong
association between MBD2 and SUMO1-mediated PPI:
again, molecules targeting one have a reasonable chance
to target the other one as an off target.
Among the top potential off targets for the molecules
inhibiting SUMO1-mediated PPI we can see proteins
commonly associated as drug targets against cancer.
For example, MBD2 belongs to the family of methylCpG binding proteins [42]. MBD2 mediates epigenetic
gene silencing and thus is an attractive target in cancer
treatment for reactivation of apoptotic genes as a primary
therapeutic mechanism. Another off target WRN is RecQ
DNA helicase that participates in suppression of DNA
hyper-recombination and repair. WRN was considered as
a cancer therapeutic target in hypopharyngeal carcinomas,
which have the worst prognosis among head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with a rapidly
rising incidence [43]. It has been shown that WRN is
highly expressed in HNSCC, and that siRNA-mediated
silencing of the gene suppressed carcinoma cell growth
in vitro. Therefore, there are several potential off targets
for the molecules inhibiting SUMO1-mediated PPI which
are potential anticancer targets. As has been already
mentioned, this knowledge could be utilized for the
development of multitarget drugs and which may therefore
provide therapeutic intervention affecting multiple
independent anticancer mechanisms.
On the other hand, there are two potential off targets
which seem better avoided. The HKDC1 (HexoKinase

Targeting SUMOylation has become an important
drug discovery trend considering the number of HTS
assays developed (see table 1). Targeting SUMOylation
has been considered as a drug discovery strategy to
overcome cancer cell resistance to chemo and radiation
therapy [41]. In particular, some studies specifically
search for small molecule inhibitors of protein-protein
interactions mediated by SUMO. The rationale in
developing an HTS assay “identification of SUMO1mediated protein-protein interactions” was a demand for
discovery of small molecules that can specifically act as
“chemical modulators” of SUMO-mediated signaling.
The assay was developed on the principal of timeresolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TRFRET) based on a N-terminal-fluorescein tagged-SUMO
1 specific sequence peptide. The binding event brings the
fluorescein acceptor moiety in close proximity to the Tbdonor to allow time-resolved lanthanide fluorescence from
the terbium. In total, a library of 362962 small molecules
was screened and 1206 molecules were reported as active
(efficiently inhibiting SUMO1-mediated protein-protein
interactions (PPI) at low concentrations).
The top ten potential off target activities for the
small molecule inhibitors of PPI mediated by SUMO
are presented in Table 4. For example, the ability of a
molecule to inhibit MBD2 significantly increases odds (~
110 fold) for the molecule to inhibit SUMO1-mediated
PPI. In total, 258 (82 + 176) molecules tested in the assay
have been reported in other HTS screens as efficient
inhibitors of MBD2 and 82 of them demonstrated potent

Domain Containing I) gene encodes mammalian
hexokinase. Hexokinases (HKs) catalyse the first step in
glucose metabolism and play a major role in regulating
the metabolic fate of glucose in the tissues where they
are expressed. The dysregulation of glucose is commonly
associated with Type 2 diabetes, and activation of
HKDC1 is considered as a potential target for diabetes
therapeutics while inhibition of HKDC1 could lead to
the undesired inhibition of glucose metabolism [44]. Rap
guanine nucleotide exchange factor (the gene is known as
RAPGEF3, but the protein is usually referred to as EPAC)
is closely involved in the regulation of cAMP signaling.
EPAC has been implicated in playing important roles in
major human pathological conditions such as diabetes
and heart disease and EPAC is now considered as a new
regulator of cardiac physiopathology [45]. Although
its effects are much less well known than the classical
cAMP effector, PKA, several studies have investigated
the cardiac role of EPAC, providing evidence that EPAC
modulates intracellular Ca(2+) levels. In one of the
first analyses, it was shown that EPAC can increase the
frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations in cultured
rat cardiomyocytes. Considering that drugs targeting
EPAC have increased chances to lead to unexpected
cardiac side effects, it would be better to select drug leads
with SUMO1-mediated PPI activities that do not possess
activity towards RAPGEF3 gene products to minimize
these risks.

endopeptidases or isopeptidases [47]. The importance of
SENPs as drug targets is emphasised by the evidence that
SUMOlation regulates cell fate decisions by regulating
p53, mdm2, and PML activity [41, 48]. A number of
assays covering SENP1, SENP6, SENP7 and SENP8 have
been developed recently (see table 1). The objective of the
assays was to identify small molecule inhibitors specific
for SENP6, SENP7 and SENP8. The assays utilized
an RLRGG-aminoluciferin peptide substrate and used
SENP8-dependent deconjugation of the aminoluciferin,
which serves as a substrate for the coupled luciferase. In
total, libraries covering ~ 300000 small molecules were
screened versus the SENP family and several thousand
molecules were reported as active (efficiently inhibiting
SENP proteases at low concentration). Table 5 reports
the top 10 ten potential off target activities for the small
molecule inhibitors of SENP6.
The ability of a molecule to inhibit SENP6 observed
in the assay was very strongly correlated with the ability
of the molecule to inhibit other SENP family members:
SENP7 and SENP8. This could be partially explained
by technical bias. The assays are based on Caspase-3
dependent deconjugation of the aminoluciferin, which
serves as a substrate for the coupled Ultra-GloTM
luciferase. Therefore, molecules inhibiting CASP3 will
also provide an artefactual signal in the assay. For this
reason several control assays have been carried out in
order to deprioritize compounds that inhibit Caspase-3.
As it can be seen from table 5, the majority of molecules
detected in the initial screen for potential SENP inhibitors
are also Caspase-3 inhibitors. Considering the numbers,

*** Molecules that have no experimentally validated targets are not accounted in the table
we can see that more than 80 percent of active molecules
are non-specific in relation to either CASP3 or other
family members.
As in previous cases, there a number of off target
activities which can be utilized for development of
multitarget drugs as well as some specific off targets
which are better to be avoided. For example, the molecules
inhibiting the SENP family seem to have increased odds
(~23 fold) to reactivate p53. Lack of p53 expression or
expression of mutant p53 is common in human cancers
and is associated with increased tumor growth and
resistance to therapies [49, 50]. Significant efforts toward
pharmaceutical reactivation of defective p53 by small
molecules are considered as an independent anticancer
therapeutic strategy [51-54]. Indeed, reactivated p53
can lead to tumor destruction [55]. Therefore, selecting
drug candidates for the next developmental stages from
SENPs screens where reactivation of p53 is a potential off
target activity would increase the chances of developing
potent anticancer agents that target independent anticancer
mechanisms.
On the other hand, those molecules inhibiting the
SENP family seem to have increased odds (~140 fold) to
inhibit PKM (pyruvate kinase, muscle). Pyruvate kinase
is a key glycolytic enzyme which is expressed as several
isoforms in many cell types (liver, pancreatic cells, small
intestine and so on). PKM has been reported to have
important roles in many diseases including cancer and
PKM polymorphisms have been shown to be associated
with type 2 diabetes [56]. Considering the complicated
and controversial role of PKM in human diseases, it would
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

be better to avoid potential drug leads that additionally
target PKM.

Discussion
There have been significant efforts in recent
years to discover small molecular potent inhibitors
of ubiquitin–proteasome or ubiquitin-like signalling
systems including a number of high-throughput screening
projects which reported thousands of potential drug lead
molecules efficiently targeting disease specific UPS-UBL
components in vitro [18, 20-22]. A critical step in drug
discovery is a selection of those drug leads that have
better chances of success in clinical trials [57]. Selected
molecules are subjected to a number of preclinical tests
to address potential issues with pharmacodynamics,
pharmacokinetics, ADME properties and potential
toxicity. Considering the low rate of success in current
drug discovery, any rationale for improving the selection
process of drug leads that increases the chances of
avoiding further safety [58] or efficacy issues [59-61] is
of paramount importance.
It is now commonly accepted that polypharmacology
(the ability to affect multiple independent protein
targets) is a basic property of small molecules [60, 6264]. Therefore, understanding the potential off target
spectrum of molecules targeting UPS(UBL) is of
practical importance [65, 66]. Here we have explored the
abundance of publicly available high-throughput screening
assay data in order to understand polypharmacology of
small molecules tested in UPS-UBL high-throughput
9652

screens (Table 1). To do this, we interrogated (> 1000)
HTS target oriented screens available in the public domain
(PubChem repository [25]), which cover a wide spectrum
of commonly accepted drug targets for various diseases.
The opportunity of such statistical analysis stems from the
fact that the chemical libraries used in most of these highthroughput screens share a significant number of common
molecules. Thus we computed for each UPS(UBL)
target the off target spectrum by counting the number
of molecules which are reported to be active/inactive
between a pair of assays (UPS-UBL assay versus off target
assay) and thus computed the shift in odds for a molecule
to target a specific component of the UPS while being
experimentally validated to target another given protein.
For each UPS(UBL) target we derived the list of top off
targets (off target spectrum) which have high odds to be
targeted by potential UPS(UBL) drug leads.
Polypharmacology of a small molecule could be
either beneficial (co-targeting of certain proteins could
increase efficiency) or the opposite (co-targeting of
certain proteins could lead to undesired side effects). Here
we have demonstrated that information for potential off
targets for molecules targeting different UPS components
could be utilized to design multi-target drugs, which are
able to affect independent disease specific mechanisms.
For example, from the HTS data we observed a strong
correlation between drugs targeting Ubc13 and APAF1.
Both targets could be potentially implicated in treatment
of the pathogenic aggregation of mutant proteins in
neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntingtons disease,
although targeting different mechanisms. This observation
(pharmacological association between Ubc13 and APAF1)
can be utilized in future efforts to identify potent drug
leads that inhibit both targets and, therefore, by affecting
two independent mechanisms in neurodegenerative
diseases the potential efficacy of the multitarget therapy
is enhanced.
Finally, we have demonstrated that information
for potential off targets for molecules targeting different
UPS components could be utilized to reduce risks
associated with potential side effects of drug leads. Among
pharmacologically associated off targets for different UPS
targets there are multiple proteins known to be associated
with various disease conditions such as cardiovascular or
diabetes. For design of anticancer agents, for example,
these types of off targets should be avoided as inhibition
or activation of these proteins might have undesirable
corresponding side effects.

There is no conflict of interest.
