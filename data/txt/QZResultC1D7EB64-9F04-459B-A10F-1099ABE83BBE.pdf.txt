Abstract
Pancreatic stellate cells (PSC), which are implicated in desmoplasia in pancreatic cancer, enhance the
malignancy of cancer cells and confer resistance to established treatments. We investigated whether the
antiﬁbrotic agent pirfenidone can suppress desmoplasia and exert antitumor effects against pancreatic cancer.
Primary PSCs were established from pancreatic cancer tissue obtained during surgery. In vitro, pirfenidone
inhibited the proliferation, invasiveness, and migration of PSCs in a dose-dependent manner. Although supernatants of untreated PSCs increased the proliferation, invasiveness, and migration of pancreatic cancer cells
(PCC), supernatants of pirfenidone-treated PSCs decreased these effects. Exposure to PCC supernatant increased
the production of platelet-derived growth factor-A, hepatic growth factor, collagen type I, ﬁbronectin, and
periostin in PSCs, which was signiﬁcantly reduced by pirfenidone. Mice were subcutaneously implanted with
PCCs (SUIT-2 cells) and PSCs into the right ﬂank and PCCs alone into the left ﬂank. Oral administration of
pirfenidone to these mice signiﬁcantly reduced tumor growth of co-implanted PCCs and PSCs, but not of PCCs
alone. Pirfenidone also decreased the proliferation of PSCs and the deposition of collagen type I and periostin in
tumors. In mice with orthotopic tumors consisting of PCCs co-implanted with PSCs, pirfenidone suppressed
tumor growth, reduced the number of peritoneal disseminated nodules, and reduced the incidence of liver
metastasis. Pirfenidone in combination with gemcitabine more effectively suppressed orthotopic tumor growth
compared with pirfenidone or gemcitabine alone. In conclusion, our ﬁndings indicate that pirfenidone is a
promising antitumor agent for pancreatic cancer, owing to its suppression of desmoplasia through regulating
PSCs. Cancer Res; 73(7); 2345–56. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is characterized by excessive desmoplasia, which contributes to the aggressive behaviors of pancreatic
cancer and resistance to traditional therapies through tumor–
stromal interactions (1). Pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) have
been identiﬁed in the interlobular areas and in peri-acinar
lesions of the pancreas and are responsible for generating
extensive ﬁbrosis in pancreatic diseases (2, 3). PSCs are activated by various stimuli and transform from quiescent cells to
myoﬁbroblast-like cells expressing a-smooth muscle actin
(SMA; ref. 4). In pancreatic cancer, PSCs are activated by
tumor–stromal interactions, including by direct contact with

pancreatic cancer cells (PCC) and paracrine growth factors
secreted from PCCs including TGF-b1, platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF), basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF), and
VEGF (5–8). Activated PSCs also secrete various growth factors, including PDGF, bFGF, TGF-b1, and connective tissue
growth factor (CTGF), to stimulate PCCs via paracrine pathways and also activate PSCs via autocrine pathways. Activated
PSCs can also produce abundant extracellular matrix (ECM)
and generate preferable microenvironments for PCCs. In vivo
studies revealed that PCCs co-implanted with PSCs showed
signiﬁcant augmentation of tumor growth and very excessive
desmoplasia (8–10). Excessive ECM deposition around tumor
cells was reported to inhibit the distribution and penetration of
anti-cancer drugs by decreasing tumor vascularity and constructing physical barriers (11, 12). These data suggest that
desmoplasia consisting of PSCs and ECM provides a signiﬁcant
contribution to the malignant behaviors of cancer cells and
resistance to established therapies, particularly for pancreatic
cancer. Therefore, new strategies targeting desmoplasia are
needed to improve the treatment paradigm of pancreatic
cancer.

safety proﬁle in patients with IPF (13, 14). IPF is a chronic,
progressive, and often fatal inﬂammatory lung disease that
results in the proliferation of ﬁbroblasts and deposition of ECM
in the interstitium and alveolar spaces of lung (15). In animal
models of lung ﬁbrosis, pirfenidone inhibited ﬁbrosis and
downregulated TGF-b, PDGF, and collagen synthesis (16–
18). In liver ﬁbrosis models, pirfenidone suppressed the proliferation of hepatic stellate cells, TGF-b mRNA expression, and
the production of collagen type I (19, 20). These reports suggest
that pirfenidone exerts antiﬁbrotic effects by inhibiting ﬁbroblasts and the production of TGF-b, PDGF, and collagen type I.
To date, however, no studies have analyzed the effects of
pirfenidone on PSCs derived from pancreatic cancer tissues.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether
pirfenidone could suppress desmoplasia in pancreatic cancer.
We assessed the effects of pirfenidone on human PSCs and
tumor–stromal interactions between PCCs and PSCs. We also
investigated the effects of pirfenidone on pancreatic cancer
xenografts co-implanted with PCCs and PSCs.

Materials and Methods
Cell isolation and culture conditions
We established human PSCs from pancreatic cancer surgical
specimens using the outgrowth method described by Bachem
and colleagues (3, 6), and cells were maintained as previously
described (21). We conﬁrmed that the PSCs exhibited a ﬁbroblast-like morphology and were immunohistochemically positive for a-SMA and glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP),
markers of PSCs, and were negative for cytokeratin, an epithelial cell marker (Supplementary Fig. S1). All of the established PSCs were used between passages 3 and 8. The use of
pancreatic cancer surgical specimens was approved by the
Ethics Committee of Kyushu University (Fukuoka, Japan) and
was conducted according to the Ethical Guidelines for Human
Genome/Gene Research enacted by the Japanese Government
and the Helsinki Declaration. We also used 2 human pancreatic
cell lines in this study; SUIT-2 and MIA PaCa-2 cells [Japan
Health Science Research Resources Bank (JCRB), Osaka,
Japan]. Both cell lines were propagated and frozen immediately
after arrival. The cells revived from the frozen stock were used
within less than 3 months. Cell lines were regularly authenticated and matched short tandem repeat DNA proﬁles of the
original cell lines by JCRB. The cells were maintained as
previously described (21).
Pirfenidone and gemcitabine preparation and treatment
For in vitro studies, pirfenidone was purchased from SigmaAldrich. The powder was dissolved in sterile water at 60 C to a
concentration of 10 mg/mL and frozen at 20 C until use. For
in vivo studies, we purchased Pirespa tablets from Shionogi &
Co. and gemcitabine from Eli Lilly & Company. The tablets
were crushed using a pestle and mortar, and dissolved in sterile
water to a pirfenidone concentration of 200 mg/mL. Pirfenidone was orally administered to nude mice (BALB/c nu/nu;
Kyudo Co.) using a ﬂexible gastric tube (KN-349, Natsume
Sisakusyo Co. Ltd.) at a dose of 500 mg/kg. Gemcitabine was
dissolved in PBS and intravenously injected into nude mice at a
dose of 40 mg/kg.

Production of conditioned media of PCCs and PSCs
We produced conditioned media of PSCs and PCCs using
serum-free Dulbeccos' Modiﬁed Eagle's Media (DMEM) to
exclude the effects of growth factors present in serum for the
following experiments. Conﬂuent (70%) SUIT-2 cells (SUIT-2SN) and 100% conﬂuent PSCs (PSC-SN) were cultured in
serum-free DMEM for 24 or 48 hours, respectively. In experiments designed to analyze the effects of pirfenidone on PSCs,
100% conﬂuent PSCs were cultured in serum-free DMEM
containing 0.3 mg/mL pirfenidone for 48 hours (pirfenidone-treated PSC-SN). The resulting conditioned media were
used to stimulate PCCs and PSCs. Proteins secreted into the
supernatant were also examined. The conditioned media were
centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1,000 rpm after collection and
stored at 80 C until use.
Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was evaluated by measuring the ﬂuorescence intensity of propidium iodide (PI), as previously
described (22). PSCs and PCCs were seeded in 24-well
tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson Labware) at a density
of 1  104 or 2  104 cells/well, respectively. The cells were then
cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 hours. After
conﬁrmation of cellular adhesion to the plates, the medium
was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS plus
pirfenidone at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/mL.
To analyze cell proliferation following stimulation with conditioned medium, the medium was replaced with SUIT-2-SN,
PSC-SN, or pirfenidone-treated PSC-SN containing 1% FBS
plus 0 or 0.3 mg/mL pirfenidone. Cell proliferation was evaluated after culture for 72 hours using PI assays. A separate well
containing the same medium and the same concentration of
pirfenidone was used to provide a baseline PI signal as a
control. The difference in intensity between each sample well
and the control well was calculated.
Matrigel invasion and migration assays
Cell invasion was measured by counting the number of cells
that invaded through Matrigel-coated Transwell chambers
with 8-mm pores (BD Biosciences). The Transwell inserts
were coated with 20 mg/well Matrigel (BD Biosciences). PSCs
(3  104 cells) and PCCs (5  104 cells) were resuspended in 250
mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS plus pirfenidone at concentrations of 0, 0.1, or 0.3 mg/mL and were placed in the upper
chamber. The upper chamber was then placed in a 24-well
culture dish containing 750 mL of the same medium with the
same concentration of pirfenidone as used in the upper
chamber. The migration of PSCs and PCCs was assessed
using uncoated Transwell inserts. Separate batches of cells
were cultured with SUIT-2-SN, PSC-SN, or pirfenidone-treated PSC-SN containing 2% FBS plus 0 or 0.3 mg/mL pirfenidone to assess the effects of PSC and PCC supernatant
stimulation on migration and invasion. After incubation for
48 hours for invasion or 24 hours for migration, the invaded
and migrated cells were ﬁxed with 70% ethanol, stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and counted in 5 random
ﬁelds at a magniﬁcation of 100 under a light microscope.
The results are expressed as the mean number of invaded

cells per ﬁeld. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate
wells and repeated 3 times.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR was
carried out as previously described (23). We designed speciﬁc
primers for a-SMA, periostin, FGF-2, and 18S rRNA using
Primer 3 software (http://primer3.sourceforge.net/). The primers used for collagen type I, ﬁbronectin, TGF-b1, PDGF-A,
PDGF-B, CTGF, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), VEGF, and
18S rRNA were purchased from Takara Bio Inc. The primer
sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Western blotting analysis
Protein was extracted from PSCs using PRO-PREP
(iNtRON biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The supernatants were concentrated using an
Amicon Ultra-10 ﬁlter unit (Millipore) at 4,000 rpm for 60
minutes, and Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Single-Use Cocktail (Thermo Scientiﬁc) was added to each
sample. The supernatants were stored at 80 C until use.
Cell lysate protein (20 mg) and supernatant (30 mg) were
fractionated on 4% to 15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Gel
(Bio-Rad Laboratories) and transferred to Trans-Blot Turbo
Mini PVDF Transfer Packs (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using a
Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer Starter System (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 C with
anti-TGF-b1 (sc-146; 1:200), anti-PDGF-A (sc-128; 1:200),
anti-PDGF-B (sc-127; 1:200), anti-CTGF (sc-101586; 1:200),
anti- HGF (sc-13087; 1:200), anti-VEGF (sc-152; 1:200), antiFGF-2 (sc-79; 1:200), anti-collagen type I (sc-8783; 1:1,000),
anti-ﬁbronectin (sc-6952; 1:1,000), anti-periostin (sc-67233;
1:1,000) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-a-SMA
(1:500; DAKO); or anti-a-tubulin (05-829; 1:1,000;
Millipore) antibodies and then probed with horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Immunoblots were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence with a ChemiDoc XRS System (Bio-Rad
Laboratories), and the density of each band was measured
using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
In vivo experiments
To analyze the effects of pirfenidone on PSCs in vivo,
SUIT-2 cells (1  106) suspended in 100 mL DMEM and PSCs
(1  106) and SUIT-2 cells (1  106) in 100 mL DMEM were
subcutaneously transplanted into the left limb and the right
limb of 6-week-old female nude mice, respectively. One
week after implantation, we randomly divided the mice
into 2 groups (15 mice/group) and orally administered them
with either 500 mg/kg pirfenidone or sterile water as a
control daily for 35 days. We also analyzed the effects of
pirfenidone alone or in combination with gemcitabine
on orthotopic implantation models. Nude mice were orthotopically implanted with SUIT-2 cells (5  105) and PSCs
(5  105) in 50 mL DMEM into the tail of the pancreas. One
week after implantation, the mice were randomized into 4
groups: control group, pirfenidone group, gemcitabine
group, and pirfenidone plus gemcitabine group. We orally

www.aacrjournals.org

administrated 500 mg/kg pirfenidone or sterile water as a
control daily and injected gemcitabine at a dose of 40 mg/kg
or PBS as a control via the tail vein once weekly for 35 days.
Twelve mice were used in each group. The mice were
sacriﬁced on day 35, and all orthotopic tumors were excised
and weighed. Tumor volume was calculated using the following formula: p/6  (L  W  W), where L ¼ the largest
tumor diameter and W ¼ the smallest tumor diameter.
The presence of peritoneal dissemination was evaluated by
counting the number of nodules larger than 1 mm in size
disseminated within the peritoneum. The presence of liver
metastasis was evaluated by counting the number of nodules
larger than 1 mm in size on the surface of the liver. All mouse
experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of
Kyushu University.
Immunohistochemistry
In vivo tumor tissues were immunostained as previously
described (23) with following primary antibodies: mouse
monoclonal anti-a-SMA (1:500; DAKO), rabbit polyclonal
anti-periostin (sc-67233; 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
mouse monoclonal anti-cytokeratin 19 (sc-376126; 1:100), and
rabbit polyclonal anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA;
ab2426; 1:500; abcam). The a-SMA–positive cells were counted
in 3 ﬁelds at a magniﬁcation of 100 under a light microscope.
The PCNA index (%) was calculated as (PCNA-positive tumor
cells/all tumor cells)  100 in 3 ﬁelds at a magniﬁcation of
100 under a light microscope.
Sirius red staining and measurements
Sections were stained using a Picrosirius Red Staining Kit
(Polysciences Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions.
The Sirius red–stained area was measured using Adobe Photoshop CS (Adobe Systems Incorporated) by selecting stained
ﬁbers in three ﬁelds at a magniﬁcation of 100 under a light
microscope.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as means  SD. Comparisons between
groups were evaluated by one-way ANOVA test followed by the
Tukey–Kramer multiple comparisons test. Values of P < 0.05
were considered statistically signiﬁcant in all analyses. All
statistical analyses were conducted using JMP 8.01 software
(SAS Institute).

Results
Pirfenidone decreases the proliferation, invasion, and
migration of PSCs
Pirfenidone inhibited the proliferation of PSCs in a dosedependent manner (P < 0.05, Fig. 1A). Although pirfenidone
also inhibited PCCs, SUIT-2 cells, and MIA PaCa-2 cells in a
dose-dependent manner, low concentrations of pirfenidone, particularly 0.3 mg/mL, showed greater inhibitory
activity on PSCs than on PCCs. Pirfenidone signiﬁcantly
decreased the invasion and migration of PSCs at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/mL but did not affect PCCs (P <
0.05, Fig. 1B–E). These data indicate that PSCs are more

SN. Stimulation with SUIT-2-SN signiﬁcantly increased the
proliferation (P < 0.05, Fig. 2A), invasiveness (P < 0.05, Fig.
2B and C), and migration (P < 0.05, Fig. 2D and E) of PSCs.
Pirfenidone signiﬁcantly decreased these effects of SUIT-2-SN
on the proliferation, invasiveness, and migration of PSCs (all P
< 0.05). These results suggest that pirfenidone suppresses PSCs
by disrupting the tumor–stromal interactions.
Pirfenidone inhibits the stimulatory effects of PSC
supernatants on PCCs
To determine the effects of pirfenidone on the tumor–
stromal interactions between PSCs and PCCs, we prepared
PSC supernatant (PSC-SN), PSC-SN supplemented with pirfenidone (PSC-SN þ pirfenidone), and pirfenidone-treated PSCSN. PSC-SN increased the proliferation of PCCs (SUIT-2 cells
and MIA PaCa-2 cells, P < 0.05, Fig. 3A). In contrast, pirfenidone-treated PSC-SN did not enhance the proliferation of PCCs
compared with PSC-SN and PSC-SN þ pirfenidone. Similarly,
pirfenidone-treated PSC-SN decreased the ability of PSCs to
enhance the invasiveness and migration of PCCs (P < 0.05, Fig.
3B–E). These ﬁndings suggest that pirfenidone may suppress
the production of factors involved in tumor–stromal interactions in PSC-SN.
Pirfenidone decreases the mRNA and protein expression
of genes involved in tumor–stromal interactions in PSCs
To assess the mechanism by which pirfenidone suppresses
tumor–stromal interactions, we determined the expression of

www.aacrjournals.org

the major factors involved in these interactions by qRT-PCR
and Western blotting of whole-cell lysates and PSC-SN. PSCs
derived from pancreatic cancer tissues secreted PDGF-A, HGF,
FGF-2, CTGF, and ECM proteins including collagen type I,
ﬁbronectin, and periostin. Treatment with pirfenidone significantly reduced the protein and mRNA expression of PDGF-A,
HGF, and periostin in PSCs (Fig. 4). Next, we analyzed the
effects of SUIT-2-SN and pirfenidone on PSC protein production and tumor–stromal interactions. Exposure to SUIT-2-SN
considerably enhanced the synthesis and secretion of PDGF-A,
HGF, collagen type I, ﬁbronectin, and periostin, which were
inhibited by pirfenidone. Pirfenidone also decreased mRNA,
but not protein, a-SMA expression in PSCs. These ﬁndings
indicate that pirfenidone disrupts tumor–stromal interactions
by suppressing the synthesis and secretion of factors involved
in these interactions, particularly PDGF-A, HGF, periostin,
collagen type I, and ﬁbronectin.
Pirfenidone inhibits subcutaneous tumor formation in
vivo in mice co-transplanted with SUIT-2 cells and PSCs
To examine the effects of pirfenidone on PCCs and PSCs in
vivo, we transplanted nude mice with SUIT-2 cells and PSCs
into the right ﬂank and SUIT-2 cells alone into the left ﬂank
(Fig. 5A). One week after implantation, we started oral administration of pirfenidone daily for 5 weeks, whereas a control
group was administered with sterile water. In the control
group, tumor growth was much greater with co-implantation

of SUIT-2 cells and PSCs compared with SUIT-2 cells alone (P <
0.05, Fig. 5A and B). The tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells coimplanted with PSCs showed marked desmoplasia with larger
Sirius red–positive areas and more a-SMA–positive cells than
the tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells alone (P < 0.05, Fig. 5C–E;
Supplementary Fig. S2). Treatment with pirfenidone signiﬁcantly suppressed the growth of tumors consisting of SUIT-2
cells co-implanted with PSCs compared with that in the
control group (P < 0.05, Fig. 5B). Pirfenidone also reduced the
Sirius red–positive area and the number of a-SMA–positive
cells in tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells co-implanted with
PSCs (P < 0.05, Fig. 5C–E). In contrast, tumor growth of SUIT-2
cells alone was not signiﬁcantly different between the pirfenidone-treated and control groups. Pirfenidone signiﬁcantly
reduced the PCNA index in tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells
co-implanted with PSCs (P < 0.05, Fig. 5F). However, the PCNA
index was not signiﬁcantly different between the control group
and the pirfenidone group in tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells
alone (P ¼ 0.98, Fig. 5F). Periostin expression was only detected
immunohistochemically in the control tumors consisting of
SUIT-2 cells co-implanted with PSCs (Fig. 5C). These ﬁndings
suggest that, at the concentration used in this experiment,
pirfenidone indirectly, rather than directly, targets pancreatic
cancer cells (i.e., SUIT-2 cells) by suppressing the growth/
proliferation of PSCs and by suppressing ECM deposition.

The inhibitory effects of pirfenidone on the growth and
metastasis of tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells coimplanted with PSCs are enhanced by combination
treatment with gemcitabine
We next investigated the effects of pirfenidone alone or in
combination with gemcitabine on growth and metastasis of
orthotopic tumors in mice. The administration of pirfenidone
and gemcitabine was started 1 week after tumor implantation.
Pirfenidone signiﬁcantly inhibited the growth of orthotopic
tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells co-implanted with PSCs, as
observed in mice with subcutaneous tumors (P < 0.05, Fig. 6A
and B; Supplementary Fig. S3B). Although gemcitabine alone
inhibited the growth of orthotopic tumors consisting of SUIT-2
cells co-implanted with PSCs, the suppressive effects were
signiﬁcantly greater when gemcitabine was administered in
combination with pirfenidone (P < 0.05). Immunohistologic
studies showed that pirfenidone signiﬁcantly suppressed the
desmoplastic reactions in orthotopic tumors whereas gemcitabine did not (P < 0.05, Fig. 6C and D; Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Although the orthotopic mice showed evidence of peritoneal
dissemination and liver metastasis, pirfenidone decreased the
number of peritoneal disseminated nodules and the incidence
of liver metastasis. These suppressive effects of pirfenidone
where signiﬁcantly enhanced by combination with gemcitabine (P < 0.05, Fig. 6E and F; Supplementary Fig. S3C; Table 1).

Figure 4. Effects of pirfenidone on gene and protein expression levels of growth factors and ECM proteins associated with tumor–stromal interactions. PSCs
were untreated or treated with pirfenidone, SUIT-2-SN, or SUIT-2-SN þ pirfenidone. mRNA expression levels were normalized to 18S rRNA expression
and are presented as the fold change in gene expression relative to control PSCs. Protein expression of growth factors was analyzed by Western blotting
of the supernatants of PSCs. Western blotting of ECM proteins and a-SMA was conducted using whole-cell lysates and the supernatant of PSCs.
a-Tubulin was used as a control to conﬁrm equal protein loading in each well for analysis of cell lysates. The densitometric data are presented as the fold
change relative to control PSCs.

These ﬁndings suggest that pirfenidone can suppress tumor
growth and metastasis of orthotopic tumors consisting of
SUIT-2 cells co-implanted with PSCs and that combination
treatment with gemcitabine has synergistic effects on these
tumors.

Discussion
We showed that PSCs increased the biologic activities
and augmented the production of PDGF-A, HGF, collagen
type I, ﬁbronectin, and periostin through tumor–stromal
interactions with PCCs. In addition, we found that pirfenidone strongly suppressed the activities of PSCs by disrupt-

ing the tumor–stromal interactions and signiﬁcantly inhibited the production of these factors. These factors play
critical roles in the tumor–stromal interactions in pancreatic cancer. PDGF was reported to induce the proliferation
and migration of PSCs through paracrine and autocrine
pathways (24–27). We previously reported that irradiated
stromal ﬁbroblasts increased the invasiveness of PCCs
through the HGF–c-Met pathway (21). Ide and colleagues
(28) reported that HGF secreted from ﬁbroblasts under
hypoxic conditions increased the invasiveness of PCCs.
ECM components, including collagen type I, ﬁbronectin,
and periostin, were reported to augment the proliferation

Figure 6. Antitumor effects of pirfenidone and/or gemcitabine on orthotopic pancreatic cancer mouse models. SUIT-2 cells and PSCs were co-implanted into
the tail of the pancreas of nude mice (n ¼ 12 mice/group). Starting 1 week after orthotopic implantation of SUIT-2 cells and PSCs, mice were intravenously
injected with gemcitabine weekly and orally administered with pirfenidone daily for 5 weeks. A, representative photographs showing the effects of gemcitabine

alone but not in mice treated with gemcitabine alone. E, representative photographs showing metastasis in the peritoneal cavity of mice after the indicated

and migration of PCCs and enhance their resistance to anticancer drugs (29–33). Consistent with these reports, PSC-SN
greatly increased the malignant potential of PCCs. Meanwhile pirfenidone-treated PSC-SN decreased the ability of
PSCs to enhance the invasiveness and migration of PCCs in

our study. The antitumor effects of pirfenidone may involve
suppression of the biologic activation of PSCs and attenuation of the tumor–stromal interactions by suppressing the
production of PDGF-A, HGF, collagen type I, ﬁbronectin,
and periostin.

Figure 5. Antitumor effects of pirfenidone on subcutaneous tumor formation in vivo. SUIT-2 cells plus PSCs (right ﬂank) or SUIT-2 cells alone (left ﬂank) were

daily for 5 weeks. A, representative micrographs after 5 weeks of treatment. B, time course of tumor growth. C, histologic evaluation of desmoplastic activity.
Periostin was expressed in tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells co-implanted with PSCs in the control group but not in pirfenidone-treated tumors. D, Sirius red
staining was more intense in tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells co-implanted with PSCs than in tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells alone. Pirfenidone
signiﬁcantly decreased the Sirius red–positive area in tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells co-implanted with PSCs. E, the number of a-SMA-positive
cells was higher in tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells co-implanted with PSCs than in tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells in the control group.
Pirfenidone decreased the number of a-SMA–positive cells in tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells co-implanted with PSCs. The a-SMA–positive cells in
tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells alone probably originated from the host, and their number was decreased by pirfenidone. F, the PCNA index (%) was
decreased by pirfenidone in tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells co-implanted with PSCs but not in tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells alone.  , P < 0.05.

For the ﬁrst time, we found that pirfenidone signiﬁcantly
suppressed the production of periostin by PSCs. Periostin,
originally called osteoblast-speciﬁc factor 2, is a 93.3-kDa
secreted protein involved in the recruitment and attachment
of osteoblast precursors in the periosteum (34, 35). Periostin is
predominantly expressed in collagen-rich ﬁbrous connective
tissues in several organs, where it regulates collagen ﬁbrillogenesis (36). Recent studies have revealed that periostin is
overexpressed in the stroma of several types of cancer including ovarian cancer, non–small cell lung cancer, colon cancer,
prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer (37). Periostin promoted tumor growth and metastasis and was associated with poor
prognosis of patients with these cancers. Erkan and colleagues
(33) reported that once PSCs are activated by PCCs, the PSCs
remained active via an autocrine periostin loop, and produced
excessive ECM creating a tumor-supportive microenvironment. Recently, periostin was reported to maintain cancer
stem cells by increasing Wnt signaling and facilitate metastatic
colonization (38). Zhu and colleagues reported that a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to periostin could inhibit ovarian
tumor growth and metastasis in mice (39). These ﬁndings
indicate that periostin provides a signiﬁcant contribution to
ﬁbrogenesis and the malignant behaviors of cancer cells. These
ﬁndings also suggest that the antitumor effects of pirfenidone
are partly mediated by inhibition of periostin production.
Therefore, inhibition of periostin production may be new
mechanism explaining the antiﬁbrotic effects of pirfenidone.
In this study, PSCs signiﬁcantly increased the growth of a
pancreatic cancer xenograft and induced excessive desmoplasia in tumor tissues, as previously reported (6, 8–10). We
revealed that oral administration of pirfenidone signiﬁcantly
suppressed in vivo tumor growth, but only when SUIT-2 cells
were co-implanted with PSCs. Pirfenidone did not affect tumor
growth of SUIT-2 cells alone. Histologically, the tumors excised
from pirfenidone-treated nude mice showed a considerable
reduction in the number of a-SMA–positive cells (i.e., PSCs),
Sirius red–positive area, and periostin expression. These ﬁndings suggest that the antitumor effects of pirfenidone in vivo
include suppressed PSC proliferation and the production of
stromal components. These effects of pirfenidone might contribute to the decreased rates of peritoneal dissemination and
liver metastasis of orthotopic tumors consisting of SUIT-2 cells
co-implanted with PSCs by suppressing the tumor–stromal
interactions. Extensive deposition of ECM components forms a
barrier that prevents the penetration of antitumor drugs and

2354

Cancer Res; 73(7) April 1, 2013

generates a hypovascular microenvironment that limits drug
delivery (11). Therefore, researchers have started to focus on
pharmacologic agents that can suppress stromal formation.
Olive and colleagues (12) reported that a hedgehog signaling
inhibitor improved the delivery of gemcitabine to PCCs by
decreasing ﬁbrotic deposition and increasing intratumoral
density in KrasLSL.G12D/þ, p53R172H/þ, PdxCretg/þ mice,
which are engineered to spontaneously generate pancreatic
cancers resembling those in humans. Although our orthotopic
pancreatic cancer mice models did not show strong resistance
to gemcitabine, the combination of pirfenidone and gemcitabine signiﬁcantly suppressed the growth of SUIT-2 cells coimplanted with PSCs compared with treatment with gemcitabine alone. Histologic examination of the orthotopic tumors
revealed that pirfenidone, but not gemcitabine, decreased
desmoplastic reactions, as observed in subcutaneous tumors.
These results suggest that co-administration of gemcitabine,
which targets cancer cells, and pirfenidone, which targets
desmoplastic activity, have synergistic antitumor effects.
Therefore, this combination may represent an ideal treatment
strategy for pancreatic cancer associated with excessive
desmoplasia.
In conclusion, the present study revealed that pirfenidone
inhibits the biologic activity of PSCs. Pirfenidone also inhibited
the production of PDGF-A, HGF, collagen type I, ﬁbronectin,
and periostin, factors that play important roles in tumor–
stromal interactions in pancreatic cancer. Pirfenidone and
gemcitabine had synergistic antitumor effects on pancreatic
cancer xenografts. Therefore, combining pirfenidone with
traditional anticancer drugs such as gemcitabine may offer
a promising treatment strategy for pancreatic cancer.
