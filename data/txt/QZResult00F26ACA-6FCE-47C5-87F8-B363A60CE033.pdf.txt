BACKGROUND. Decitabine, a hypomethylating agent, is active and has been approved
for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia. Intensive chemotherapy is an accepted form of therapy for patients with
higher risk MDS. The comparative efficacy of these 2 forms of treatment in MDS is
unknown. The objective of the current study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity
profiles of decitabine and intensive chemotherapy in MDS.

METHODS. The authors compared lower intensity decitabine therapy (n ¼ 115
patients) with intensive chemotherapy (as it is used in acute myeloid leukemia
[AML]) in patients with higher risk MDS. Two comparisons were made with a cohort
of 376 historic patients (from 1995 to 2005): The first comparison included a subcohort of 115 patients (Group A) who matched the 115 decitabine study patients

RESULTS. The complete remission (CR) rate according to AML criteria was 43% with
decitabine, 46% with intensive chemotherapy in Group A, and 52% with intensive
chemotherapy in Group B. Compared with Group A, mortality at 6 weeks was 3%
with decitabine versus 13% with intensive chemotherapy (P ¼ .006) and, at 3 months,
7% with decitabine versus 23% with intensive chemotherapy (P ¼ .001). Survival was
better with decitabine versus intensive chemotherapy in Group A (median survival:
22 months vs 12 months; P < .001). A multivariate analysis of survival in all 491
patients who received decitabine or intensive chemotherapy (Group B) selected decitabine as an independent, favorable prognostic factor for survival (P ¼ .006; hazard
ratio, 0.74) after accounting for the independent prognostic effect of pretreatment
factors.

CONCLUSIONS. In this analysis, decitabine was associated with a survival advantage
compared with intensive chemotherapy in patients with higher risk MDS. Future
studies should evaluate prospectively the results of decitabine versus intensive
chemotherapy in this setting. Cancer 2007;109:1133–7.

yelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous disorders
characterized by a hypercellular bone marrow with dysplastic
changes and peripheral cytopenias.1,2 Several prognostic models,
including the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), have
been proposed to account for the heterogeneity in MDS.3–5 Prognostic
factors include the percent of bone marrow blasts, cytogenetic
abnormalities, the degree and number of cytopenias (according to the
IPSS), and others.6 Patients with higher risk MDS, usually with 5%

blasts or in the IPSS intermediate-high risk group,
have a poor survival.5 Standard therapies in higher risk
MDS include intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic
stem cell transplantation (SCT).7–9 Because the median age of patients with MDS is from 65 years to
70 years, allogeneic SCT is possible in only a minority
of patients. Intensive chemotherapy may result in
complete remission (CR) rates of 40% to 60% but is
associated with considerable morbidity and with mortality rates of 20% to 40%, depending on the definition
of induction mortality (eg, at 4 weeks vs 8 weeks).
Hypomethylating agents like decitabine and 5-azacytidine have shown positive results in MDS and chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).10–12 They are
considered lower intensity therapies and have been
associated with low treatment-related mortality as a
consequence of myelosuppression.
The long-term prognosis in MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been related to improvements
in rates of complete remission (CR). However, prognosis also is related to the composite effects of a treatment’s capacity to induce CR and its adverse effect on
mortality. Responses other than CR may improve prognosis through the induction of quality responses that
improve cytopenias.
To our knowledge, no studies to date have compared the long-term results of lower intensity chemotherapy (eg, hypomethylating agents) with results from
AML-type intensive chemotherapy in higher risk MDS.
This is the focus of the current analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Decitabine Study Group and Therapy
Adults with a diagnosis of MDS or CMML who were
referred to The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from November 2003 through July 2006 were
offered decitabine therapy on study (Protocol ID030180) after informed consent was obtained according to
institutional guidelines. Eligibility criteria included 1)
age 16 years, 2) a diagnosis of MDS (IPSS intermediate- or high-risk) or CMML, and 3) normal organ function, including creatinine 2 mg/dL and bilirubin 2
mg/dL. Patients who had received prior intensive chemotherapy with cytarabine 1 g/m2 were not eligible.
The diagnosis of CMML was based on the typical
morphologic picture, including unexplained leukocytosis >12 3 109/L that lasted for 3 months, excluding
other myeloproliferative disorders, and the presence of
109/L monocytes.
Patients were randomized to receive decitabine on
1 of 3 schedules: 1) 20 mg/m2 intravenously over 1 hour
daily for 5 days; 2) 20 mg/m2 daily for 5 days given in
2 subcutaneous doses daily; or 3) 10 mg/m2 intravenously over 1 hour daily for 10 days. All patients

received the same decitabine total dose per course, 100
mg/m2. Details of therapy, monitoring, dose modifications, antibiotics prophylaxis, growth factors support,
other supportive care measures, statistical design, and
results of the Bayesian randomization have been published in detail.12,13 The Bayesian design selected decitabine 20 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 5 days as
the schedule associated with the highest likelihood of
achieving CR, as reported previously.12
The study group has accrued a total of 115 patients.
The characteristics of these patients are shown in Table 1.

Historic Control Group Treated With Intensive Chemotherapy
To evaluate the results of decitabine versus intensive
chemotherapy, we analyzed the details of patients with
higher risk MDS who had received intensive AML-type
chemotherapy during a reasonably comparable period,
ie, since 1995. We excluded from the historic control
group patients who did not fit the decitabine protocol
eligibility criteria (performance status of 3 or 4, creatinine >2.0 mg/dL, and bilirubin >2.0 mg/dL). In total,
376 historic controls were identified. These patients
received AML-type chemotherapy according to the
frontline AML study of the period, as detailed previously.7 The regimens used were anthracyclines plus
high-dose cytarabine (156 patients), topotecan plus
high-dose cytarabine with or without cyclophosphamide (138 patients), clofarabine or fludarabine plus
high-dose cytarabine (36 patients), other cytarabine
regimens (18 patients), and noncytarabine regimens
(28 patients).7 Our previous analysis indicated that
these regimens produced equivalent results.7
The comparisons of the decitabine study group
were performed in 2 different analyses. In the first analysis, we matched each patient who received decitabine to
1 patient from the historic control group who received
intensive chemotherapy. Patients were matched for 1)
age (5 years), 2) chromosomal abnormalities, and 3)
IPSS risk group prior to therapy. This historic control
group (Group A) included 115 patients. One hundred
eleven patients in the decitabine group and 111 patients
in the historic control group were matched completely
on those 3 criteria, and the other 8 patients were
matched as best as possible (with 2 of 3 features matching). In the second analysis, we compared the decitabine
study group with the whole cohort of 376 historic
patients with higher risk MDS who received intensive
chemotherapy in 1995 (Group B).
Response Criteria and Statistical Considerations
To allow comparisons of the decitabine results with
other agents/regimens, the response rate of the decitabine trial were updated using the International Working
Group (IWG) modified response criteria.14,15 However,

* The P values refer to differences between the decitabine group and either of the 2 historic control groups.

when comparing CR rates with the historic experience,
the AML response criteria were used, because these
were the only responses coded for the historic control
group that received intensive chemotherapy.16 Survival
was dated from the start of therapy.

RESULTS
The characteristics of the decitabine study group are
detailed in Table 1 and are compared with the 2 historic
intensive chemotherapy groups. Because of the selection of historic Group A, as expected, the characteristics
of the 2 groups were similar, except that a higher percentage of patients in the historic group had >10%
blasts (57% vs 43%; P ¼ .05). Patients who received
receiving decitabine therapy had comparable CR rates
according to the AML criteria (43% vs 46% for the control group; P ¼ .69) but had a significantly lower 6-week
mortality rate (3% vs 13%; P ¼ .006) and 3-month mor-

tality rate (7% vs 23%; P ¼ .001). Survival was significantly better with decitabine overall (median survival,
22 months vs 12 months; 2-year survival, 47% vs
24%; P <.001) (Fig. 1A) and according to age groups
(ages <60 years and 60 years). In younger patients
(aged <60 years), the 2-year survival rates were 63%
versus 32% (P ¼ .02). In older patients (aged 60
years), the 2-year survival rates were 40% versus
20% (P ¼ .001).
In the second analysis, several pretreatment characteristics of the patients in decitabine study group and
in historic control Group B differed (Table 1). According
to the AML criteria, the CR rates were 43% versus 52%,
respectively (P ¼ .09), and the respective 6-week mortality rates were 3% versus 12% (P ¼ .002). Survival was
significantly better with decitabine overall (2-year
survival, 47% vs 21%; P < .0001) (Fig. 1B) in older
patients (2-year survival, 40% vs 17%; P < .001) and in

younger patients (2-year survival, 63% vs 28%; P ¼ .002)
(Fig. 2A,B). A multivariate analysis that included pretreatment characteristics selected the following as
independent poor prognostic factors: chromosome 5 or
7 abnormalities (P < .01), thrombocytopenia (P < .01),
and older age (P < .01). After accounting for these
characteristics, therapy with decitabine remained an
independent favorable prognostic factor for survival
(P ¼ .006; hazard ratio, 0.74).

Overall Response to Decitabine by the IWG Modified Criteria
Response to decitabine among the 115 treated patients
according to the IWG modified criteria was a complete
response in 40 patients (35%), a partial response in
2 patients (2%), a bone marrow complete response in
12 patients (10%), a bone marrow complete response
and hematologic improvements in 14 patients (12%),
and hematologic improvements in 12 patients (10%;

1 lineage improvement in 8 patients; 2 or 3 lineage
improvements in 4 patients).
Among 87 patients with red cell transfusion dependence or hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL, 40 patients
(46%) improved their hemoglobin levels by 1.0 g/dL
or became transfusion independent. Among 83 patients
with pretreatment platelet counts <100 3 109/L, 41
patients (49%) ultimately achieved platelet counts
100 3 109/L. According to the IWG response criteria,
50 of 83 patients (60%) with pretreatment platelet
counts <100 3 109/L had a platelet response, with
either an increase from <20 3 109/L to >20 3 109/L
and an increase 100% (10 of 19 patients; 53%) or
an absolute increase in the platelet count 30 3 109/L
(40 of 64 patients; 62%) that lasted for 2 months.
Cytogenetic abnormalities were present pretreatment
in 69 of 115 patients who received decitabine. A complete cytogenetic response was observed in 24 of 69
patients (35%), and a partial cytogenetic response was
observed in 11 additional patients (16%).

Decitabine vs Chemotherapy in MDS/Kantarjian et al.

DISCUSSION
In this study, lower intensity therapy with decitabine
was associated with better outcome compared with intensive chemotherapy in patients with higher risk MDS.
Although the CR rate was lower with decitabine, the
early (6-week) mortality rates (3% vs 13%; P ¼ .002) and
the 3-month mortality rates (7% vs 23%; P ¼ .001) were
significantly lower. This resulted in a significantly better
overall survival with decitabine in a comparison with a
matched historic control group that received intensive
chemotherapy (Fig. 1) and in a multivariate analysis
using a larger historic control group that received intensive chemotherapy in the modern era (hazard ratio for
decitabine vs intensive chemotherapy, 0.74; P ¼ .006).
The survival benefit was not confined to older patients
(possibly reflecting a high mortality with intensive
chemotherapy) but was also observed in younger
patients. This may indicate a role for decitabine maintenance after intensive chemotherapy in younger
patients with higher risk MDS or AML, as part of noncross-resistant sequential combination strategies.
To provide comparisons with other recent antiMDS strategies, we updated the decitabine results in
115 patients treated so far by using the IWG modified
response criteria. Overall, 35% of patients achieved CR,
and 70% had an objective response. It is noteworthy
that significant cytopenias were improved in approximately 50% to 60% of patients with MDS. These results
compared favorably with those reported with either
decitabine (CR rate, 9%) or 5-azacitidine (CR rate, 7%)
in previous randomized trials.10,11 This may reflect the
dose intensity of the current decitabine approach versus the decitabine randomized study. Because of major
differences in study groups, the comparative efficacy of
decitabine versus 5-azacitidine needs to be evaluated in
a randomized trial for patients with MDS.
In summary, the results from the current analysis
suggest a survival benefit of decitabine as lower intensity hypomethylating therapy compared with AML-type
intensive chemotherapy in patients with higher risk
MDS. Future studies should evaluate prospectively the
results of decitabine versus intensive chemotherapy in
MDS.
