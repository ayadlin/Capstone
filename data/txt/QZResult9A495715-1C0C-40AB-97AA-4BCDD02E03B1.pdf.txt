YAP-Induced Resistance of Cancer Cells to Antitubulin Drugs
Is Modulated by a Hippo-Independent Pathway

Abstract
Although antitubulin drugs are used widely to treat human cancer, many patients display intrinsic or
acquired drug resistance that imposes major obstacles to successful therapy. Mounting evidence argues that
cancer cell apoptosis triggered by antitubulin drugs relies upon activation of the cell-cycle kinase Cdk1;
however, mechanistic connections of this event to apoptosis remain obscure. In this study, we identiﬁed the
antiapoptotic protein YAP, a core component of the Hippo signaling pathway implicated in tumorigenesis, as
a critical linker coupling Cdk1 activation to apoptosis in the antitubulin drug response. Antitubulin drugs
activated Cdk1, which directly phosphorylated YAP on ﬁve sites independent of the Hippo pathway.
Mutations in these phosphorylation sites on YAP relieved its ability to block antitubulin drug-induced
apoptosis, further suggesting that YAP was inactivated by Cdk1 phosphorylation. Notably, we found that YAP
was not phosphorylated and inactivated after antitubulin drug treatment in taxol-resistant cancer cells. Our
ﬁndings suggest YAP and its phosphorylation status as candidate prognostic markers in predicting
antitubulin drug response in patients. Cancer Res; 74(16); 4493–503. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Antitubulin drugs, including paclitaxel (taxol), docetaxel,
and vinblastine, have widely been used for the treatment of a
variety of human cancers such as breast and ovarian cancers,
non–small cell lung cancer, and head and neck cancer (1–3).
These drugs can directly bind to b-tubulin and either promote
or reduce b-tubulin polymerization, which changes the stability of microtubules (4). The change in microtubule stability can
subsequently exert a mitotic block by altering kinetochore
tension, which can activate the spindle assembly checkpoint,
resulting in mitotic delay and subsequent apoptosis (5).
Although antitubulin drugs kill cancer cells and can sometimes
effectively suppress tumor growth in patients with cancer, a
signiﬁcant proportion of tumors is either intrinsically resistant
to antitubulin drugs or later develop resistance after primary
therapy, leading to disease relapse and patient mortality, which
is a major obstacle to successful cancer treatments (2, 6).
Therefore, identiﬁcation and characterization of cellular genes
or signaling pathways responsible for antitubulin drug resistance are critical for successful treatment of cancers. In

addition, although tremendous progress has been made
toward identifying the genes involved in antitubulin drug
response, surprisingly, the signaling pathways by which antitubulin drugs cause mitotic arrest and cell death are poorly
deﬁned.
YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional
coactivator with PDZ-binding motif) are paralogs of WW
domain-containing transcriptional coactivators, which share
60% similarity and activate many transcriptional factors
important for the development of various tissues in mammals
(7, 8). Recently, TAZ and YAP have been identiﬁed as oncogenes
and major components of an emerging Hippo signaling pathway that plays important roles in regulating animal size, cell
proliferation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, stem cell renewal and
differentiation, neuronal growth, and mechanotransduction in
both Drosophila and mammals (8–12). In this novel pathway,
mammalian homologs of Drosophila Hippo, Mst1, and Mst2
phosphorylate and activate tumor suppressors and kinases
LATS1 and LATS2, which in turn inactivate YAP and TAZ by
phosphorylating multiple sites (ﬁve sites for YAP and four sites
for TAZ) with consensus sequence of HxH/R/KxxS/T (H,
histine; x, any amino acid; R, arginine; K, lysine; S, serine; T,
threonine; Mst1/2!LATS1/2!YAP/TAZ). These core components also interact with many upstream (e.g., NF2, RASSF1A,
and FAT4) and downstream (e.g., CTGF, Cyr61, and BMP4)
cellular genes, forming a complex Hippo signaling pathway.
Recently, we and others have identiﬁed YAP and TAZ as
important players in response of breast cancer cells to apoptosis induced by antitubulin drug taxol (13, 14). It has been
shown that overexpression of YAP or TAZ in MCF10A mammary cells causes transformation, epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (EMT), and resistance to taxol, whereas knockdown
of TAZ in MDA-MD231 breast cancer cells sensitize these cells

to taxol (14). However, whether YAP and TAZ overexpression causes resistance of cancer cells to other antitubulin
drugs is unclear. In addition, the upstream signaling pathways or genes modulating YAP/TAZ in response to taxol
remains to be identiﬁed. In this study, we have discovered
that YAP is speciﬁcally phosphorylated by Cdk1/Cyclin B
kinase after antitubulin drug treatment independent of the
upstream Hippo signaling pathway. We have provided
strong evidence that phosphorylation of YAP by Cdk1/Cyclin
B inhibits YAP-induced resistance of cancer cells to antitubulin drug treatment.

in HeLa cells, a set of shJNK1 or shJNK2 in pTRIPZ lentiviral
vector targeting different sequences of JNK1 or JNK2 mRNA
(Open Biosystems) were screened (data not shown), and the
cells infected with lentivirus expressing shJNK1/JNK2 with
the best knockdown were used for functional studies. To
establish CDK1 knockdown cell lines in HeLa cells, shCDK1
(Supplementary Table S2) was subcloned from pGIPZ into
pTRIPZ lentiviral vector. To establish MCF10A cells overexpressing YAP and its phosphorylation site mutants, MCF10A
cells were infected by lentivirus expressing WPI vector, YAPWT-HA, YAP-5SA-HA, or YAP-5SD-HA at similar multiplicity of
infection.

Materials and Methods

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR were as described (15).

Plasmid construction and site-directed mutagenesis
Plasmid construction and site-directed mutagenesis were
performed as described in (15).
Cell culture and treatments of cells by chemotherapeutic
drugs, kinase inhibitors, and anoikis
Cell culture was as described (15). HeLa cells were treated
with antitubulin drugs (Supplementary Table S1) for various
times, followed by protein extraction and Western blot analysis. For dose-dependent YAP phosphorylation, HeLa cells
were treated with increasing concentration (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5,
10, 50, 100, and 500 nmol/L) of taxol for 24 hours, followed by
protein extraction and Western blot analysis. For kinase
inhibitor treatments, HeLa cells were pretreated with inhibitors for CDK, JNK, p38, GSK, MEK, DYRK, and mTOR (see
Supplementary Table S1 for details) for 2 hours, followed by
treatment with these inhibitors for 22 hours in the presence of
100 nmol/L taxol.
To test whether YAP phosphorylation is due to loss of
anchorage of cells after antitubulin drug treatment, HeLa
cells were plated onto a 60-mm plate coated with poly-HEMA
(20 mg/mL; Sigma) and incubated at 37 C for 24 hours. The
ﬂoating cells were then collected for protein extraction and
Western blot analysis.

Antibodies, Western blot analysis,
coimmunoprecipitation, immunostaining
The antibodies used in this study were purchased and used
as listed in Supplementary Table S3. Rabbit anti-phospho-YAPS367 polyclonal antibody was produced by injection of conjugated phospho-peptide (KQNPVSpSPGMSQ) into rabbit

spectrometry
HeLa cells were treated with 100 nmol/L taxol for 24 hours.
Floating cells were collected and extracted for protein with
1% NP40 lysis buffer. About 30 mg of protein lysate were
immunoprecipitated with anti-YAP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) polyclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitated YAP was
subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with commassie
blue. The phosphorylated YAP band was cut and identiﬁcation of YAP and phosphorylated YAP peptides was performed
as described (16).

B mRNA (siCyclin B) were purchased from Dharmacon (Supplementary Table S2; Thermo Fisher). An siRNA with scrambled sequence (siControl) was used as a negative control. HeLa
cells were transfected with 50 nmol/L of siRNAs using RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Two days posttransfection, cells were treated with 100
nmol/L Taxol for 24 hours, followed by protein extraction and
Western blot analysis.

24 hours. Interestingly, band-shifts of YAP and TAZ were
detected in ﬂoating (F) cells, which are mitotic arrested
[decreased phosphorylated Y15-Cdk1 (pCdk1)] and apoptotic
[increased cleaved PARP (cPARP)] cells, rather than adherent
(A) live cells (high pCdk1 and low cPARP; Fig. 1A and B).
Besides band-shift, levels of TAZ rather than YAP were gradually decreased with time after taxol treatment (Fig. 1A). The
band-shifts of both YAP and TAZ can be reversed after treatment of protein lysates from taxol-treated HeLa cells with calf
intestine phosphatase (CIP; Fig. 1C), suggesting that the bandshifts of YAP and TAZ after taxol treatment are due to
phosphorylation. To further examine whether YAP and TAZ
changes are speciﬁc for taxol drug, we examined the status of
YAP and TAZ after treatment of HeLa cells with a wide variety
of chemotherapeutic drugs. YAP phosphorylation is only
detected in antitubulin drug-treated cells, which speciﬁcally
caused reduced pCdk1, whereas TAZ phosphorylation/degradation was found in cells treated by almost all of the drugs, as
indicated by increased apoptotic marker cPARP (Fig. 1D).
These results clearly demonstrated that YAP is speciﬁcally
phosphorylated during mitotic arrest and apoptosis induced
by antitubulin drugs in HeLa cells. To further explore whether
YAP phosphorylation is dependent of drug dose, we treated

www.aacrjournals.org

HeLa cells with increasing concentration of taxol. As expected,
increasing YAP phosphorylation was detected with the
increase of taxol drug concentration, which is correlated with
increasing levels of cPARP and decreasing levels of pCdk1
(Fig. 1E), especially when taxol concentration is higher than 10
nmol/L. Because antitubulin drugs can disrupt microtubule
and cause loss of cell adhesion on the cell culture plate and
previous studies have shown that the Hippo pathway plays
important roles in anoikis (17), we tested whether YAP phosphorylation is due to loss-of-anchorage of cells during antitubulin drug treatment. Interestingly, although both taxol
treatment and incubation of cells on HEMA-coated plate
induced apoptosis as indicated by increased cPARP, the YAP
band-shift/phosphorylation is only detected after taxol treatment (Fig. 1F), suggesting that YAP phosphorylation is not due
to loss-of-anchorage of cells after antitubulin drug treatment.
Next, we also tested to see whether YAP phosphorylation is
speciﬁc for HeLa cells and found that YAP is phosphorylated in
a wide variety of human cancer cells after taxol treatment
(Fig. 1G), suggesting that YAP phosphorylation after antitubulin drug treatments occurs in various tissues. Finally, we
showed that YAP is phosphorylated after taxol treatment only
in taxol-sensitive (SK-BR3) cells rather than its taxol-resistant

counterpart (Sk-BR3-TR; Fig. 1H). Together, these ﬁndings
strongly suggest that YAP can be speciﬁcally phosphorylated
in apoptotic cells in a wide variety of cell types after treatment
with antitubulin drugs such as taxol and vinblastine other than
drugs such as doxorubicin and cisplatin.
Phosphorylation of YAP is Hippo independent
Next, we examined the expression of other Hippo core
components and kinases Mst1, Mst2, LATS1, and LATS2.
Except for LATS2, phosphorylation of Mst1/2 (pMst) and
LATS1 (pLATS1), which normally activate their kinase activity,
is signiﬁcantly increased (Fig. 2A). Because our previous studies showed that LATS1 inactivates YAP by phosphorylating ﬁve
sites (15), we examined whether increased phosphorylation/
activity of LATS1 is responsible for YAP phosphorylation after
taxol treatment by testing the levels of phosphorylated S127
(pS127) of YAP using anti-phospho-YAP-S127 antibody. Surprisingly, after taxol treatment, the levels of YAP-p127 gradually decreased after taxol treatment (Fig. 2B). Because LATS1/2
can phosphorylate YAP at ﬁve sites (15, 18), it is possible that
LATS1 may phosphorylate YAP on other sites rather than S127.
To test this possibility, we transfected WT YAP (YAP-HA) or
YAP mutant with ﬁve LATS phosphorylation site mutations
(YAP-5SA-HA) into HeLa cells. Unexpectedly, both YAP-HA
and YAP-5SA-HA mutant are phosphorylated after taxol treatment (Fig. 2C). To exclude the possibility that LATS1 may

4496

Cancer Res; 74(16) August 15, 2014

phosphorylate other sites besides the Hippo-dependent ﬁve
phosphorylation sites on YAP after taxol treatment, we treated
LATS1/ MEF with taxol. Western blot analysis clearly
showed that YAP was still phosphorylated after taxol treatment (Fig. 2D). In addition, transient knockdown of LATS1
alone in HeLa cells by two different siLATS1 (siLATS1-A and
siLATS1-B) or knockdown of both LATS1 and LATS2 by siRNAs
also cannot block taxol-induced YAP phosphorylation (Fig. 2E
and F). Moreover, YAP can be still phosphorylated after taxol
treatment even when both Mst1 and Mst2, two major upstream
kinases of LATS, were simultaneously knocked down (Fig. 2G).
Together, our data convincingly demonstrate that antitubulin
drugs induce YAP phosphorylation independent of the
upstream Hippo signaling pathway and suggest that other
kinase (s) may be responsible for YAP phosphorylation after
antitubulin drug treatment.
Identiﬁcation of YAP phosphorylation sites
To identify the kinase (s) phosphorylating YAP, we ﬁrst
attempted to map the YAP phosphorylation sites. Immunoprecipitated YAP from protein lysate extracted from taxoltreated HeLa cells was subjected to mass-spectrometric identiﬁcation of phospho-peptides. Four YAP phosphorylation
sites including S128, S138, S289, and S367 were identiﬁed and
all of these sites contain a "SP" motif (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S1). To conﬁrm these potential phosphorylation

sites, we constructed plasmids expressing various deletions
and mutations of YAP (Fig. 3B and C) and transfected them
into HeLa cells. Mutations of both S128 and S138 into alanines
(A, S128A/S138A) rather than a single mutation alone (S128A
or S138A) abolish taxol-induced YAP1-150-HA phosphorylation (Fig. 3B and C, top). Although mutation of S289 or S367
alone (S289A or S367A) only has minor effect, mutation of
both sites (S289A/S367A) dramatically decreases YAP203-400HA phosphorylation. Because S289A/S367A double mutants
were unable to completely abolish YAP203-400-HA phosphorylation, it is possible that another phosphorylation site not
identiﬁed by mass spectrometry may exist. By scanning YAP
sequence, we identiﬁed another potential phosphorylation
site, S217, which also contains "SP" motif within YAP203-400
sequence (Fig. 3B). Triple mutation S217A/S289A/S367A
completely abolishes YAP203-400 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C,
middle). Consistent with mass spectrometry analysis, mutation of S367 (S367A) rather than T412 (T412A), which also
contains a "TP" motif, completely abolishes the phosphorylation of YAP300-504-HA. Together, through YAP deletion/
mutation analysis, we have identiﬁed ﬁve novel YAP sites

(YAP2L, a longer isoform of YAP, is used in the present study.
Refer to Supplementary Table S4 for corresponding positions
in other YAP isoforms) that are signiﬁcantly phosphorylated
after taxol treatment. We have further tested these ﬁve
phosphorylation sites individually or in combination using
full-length YAP. Mutation of only S367 rather than other ﬁve
phosphorylation sites signiﬁcantly but not completely
reverses YAP-HA phosphorylation and band-shift, whereas
mutation of all of the ﬁve phosphorylation sites (5SA-TX)
completely abolishes YAP phosphorylation after taxol treatment (Fig. 3D). To further conﬁrm this result in vivo, we raised
antibody against the major YAP phosphorylation site, S367.
The puriﬁed anti-pS367-YAP antibody speciﬁcally recognizes
phosphorylated WT YAP rather than YAP-S367A with S367
mutation (Fig. 3E). YAP phosphorylation on S367 (pS367) is
signiﬁcantly increased in ﬂoating apoptotic rather than adherent live HeLa cells after taxol treatment (Figs. 1A and 3F). In
addition, we found that YAP-pS367 is signiﬁcantly increased in
Sk-BR3 cells rather than taxol-resistant SK-BR3-TR cells after
taxol treatment (Fig. 3G). In summary, we have successfully
identiﬁed 5 "SP" motif-containing phosphorylation sites that

are responsible for YAP phosphorylation/band-shift after taxol
treatment.
Identiﬁcation of Cdk1 as a novel upstream kinase
phosphorylating YAP after taxol treatment
Because all of the ﬁve YAP phosphorylation sites contain a
"SP" motif, we used PhosphoNet Kinase Predictor program to
predict potential kinase(s) phosphorylating these motifs. Seven
potential kinases with high prediction score were selected as
candidate kinases. By using inhibitors for each speciﬁc kinase
(Supplementary Table S1), we found that inhibition of JNK or
CDK kinase completely abolishes YAP phosphorylation after
taxol treatment (Fig. 4A). Because inhibitors sometimes have
nonspeciﬁc activity, we directly knocked down both JNK1 and
JNK2, two major JNK family members, using doxocyclineinducible shJNK1 and shJNK2. As shown in Fig. 4B and C, YAP

was still phosphorylated after knockdown of both JNK1 and
JNK2 (both JNK1 and JNK2 have two isoforms/bands), suggesting that JNK is not the kinase responsible for YAP phosphorylation. Supporting our unexpected data, previous studies
showed that the widely used "JNK" inhibitor used in our study,
SP600125, can in fact inhibit Cdk kinase nonspeciﬁcally (19).
Because Cdk inhibitor also abolishes YAP phosphorylation
(Fig. 4A), it is possible that Cdk kinase, speciﬁcally Cdk1/Cyclin
B, a kinase complex well known to be involved in taxol-induced
mitotic arrest and apoptosis (20, 21), may be essential for YAP
phosphorylation. We ﬁrst used several general Cdk inhibitors
(ROS, Pur A, OLO II) and a Cdk1-speciﬁc inhibitor (RO-3366) to
test whether they can block taxol-induced phosphorylation.
Signiﬁcantly, treatment of HeLa cells with all of these inhibitors
completely abolishes taxol-induced YAP phosphorylation
(Fig. 4D). Second, to eliminate the possibility of nonspeciﬁc

effects caused by Cdk1 inhibitors, we transiently knockdown
Cdk1 by siCdk1 or doxocycline-inducible shCdk1 alone or in
combination. Surprisingly, although Cdk1 was knocked down
signiﬁcantly by siCdk1 or shCdk1, YAP was still partially
phosphorylated, suggesting that residual Cdk1 may still be
able to phosphorylate YAP. However, Cdk1 knockdown by
combined effect of siCdk1 and shCdk1 plus doxocycline can
completely abolish taxol-induced YAP phosphorylation (Fig.
4E). Similarly, inactivation of Cdk1/Cyclin B kinase complex by
knocking down Cyclin B with siCyclin B also abolishes taxolinduced YAP phosphorylation (Fig. 4F). Our in vitro kinase
assays also showed that puriﬁed Cdk1/Cyclin B kinase can
directly phosphorylate puriﬁed YAP-GST rather than GST
control in vitro (Fig. 4G, left and center). This result was further
conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis of the same blot using antiphospho-YAP-S367 antibody (Fig. 4G, right) and in vitro peptide kinase assay in which WT containing S128 site rather than
its mutant S128V peptide was signiﬁcantly phosphorylated by
Cdk1/Cyclin B in vitro (Fig. 4H). Altogether, our studies clearly
demonstrated that Cdk1 is indeed the critical kinase phosphorylating YAP during antitubulin drug response. Next, we
would like to know whether Cdk1 is also responsible for TAZ

phosphorylation. Although only S128 in YAP is conserved in
TAZ, there are other ﬁve potential "SP" or "TP" sites in TAZ that
could be phosphorylated by Cdk1 after taxol treatment. To test
this possibility, we have ﬁrst tested TAZ phosphorylation/
degradation after Cdk1 knockdown. Interestingly, TAZ phosphorylation/degradation is signiﬁcantly blocked in Cdk1
knockdown HeLa cells after taxol treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). In addition, mutation of all potential Cdk1 phosphorylation sites containing "SP" or "TP" motif in TAZ (TAZ6SA) also signiﬁcantly block taxol-induced TAZ phosphorylation/degradation (Supplementary Fig. S2B), suggesting that
TAZ may be also phosphorylated by Cdk1.
Effect of YAP phosphorylation on its transactivating
activity
We have previously shown that interaction and activation of
transcription factor TEAD4 is essential for TAZ-induced taxol
resistance in mammary cells (14). To examine the effect of
YAP phosphorylation on its function, we have performed Co-IP
analysis of YAP and TEAD4 in the absence and presence
of taxol treatment (Fig. 5A and B). In the absence of
taxol treatment, HA-tagged YAP strongly interacts with

FLAG-tagged TEAD4 in vivo in HeLa cells. Although treatment
of HeLa cells has no effect on the levels of both YAP-HA and
TEAD4-FLAG (for better quantiﬁcation, high percentage of
SDS-PAGE was run for Western blot analysis to eliminate YAPHA band-shift in taxol-treated protein lysate), taxol treatment
signiﬁcantly reduced the interaction of YAP-HA with TEAD4FLAG (Fig. 5A). However, this disruption of YAP-TEAD4 interaction was rescued after inactivation of Cdk1 by Cyclin B
knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S3A). In addition, taxol treatment was unable to disrupt interaction between phosphorylation-deﬁcient YAP-5SA-TX and TEAD4 (Supplementary Fig.
S3B), suggesting that phosphorylation of YAP after taxol
treatment is essential for its reduced interaction with TEAD
after taxol treatment. To directly conﬁrm that YAP phosphorylation reduces its interaction with TEAD4, we also constructed YAP mutants that change all ﬁve serine phosphorylation sites to either "A"s (YAP-5SA-TX, inactivating mutation)
or aspartic acid (YAP-5SD-TX, mimicking phosphorylation).
YAP-5SA-TX is used to distinguish it from the LATS phosphorylation mutant YAP-5SA (Fig. 2C). Consistent with taxol treatment experiment, although similar levels of WT (YAP-HA) and
mutant YAP were detected in cells, interaction of TEAD4-FLAG
with YAP-5SD-TX-HA is signiﬁcantly weaker than that with
YAP-HA or YAP-5SA-TX-HA (Fig. 5B), suggesting that taxolinduced YAP phosphorylation may reduce its ability to interact
with and activate transcription factor TEAD. To conﬁrm that
reduced interaction of YAP with TEAD after phosphorylation
causes its decreased cotransactivating activity, we ﬁrst established MCF10A mammary cells stably expressing WPI lentiviral
vector, WT, or mutant YAP. Previous studies have shown that
overexpression of YAP in MCF10A cells causes increased
expression of CTGF and Cyr61 mRNA through interaction
with and activation of transcription factor TEAD (15, 22). As
expected, compared with WPI control, overexpression of YAPWT or YAP-5SA signiﬁcantly activates mRNA levels of its
downstream transcriptional targets CTGF and Cyr61 in
MCF10A cells (Fig. 5D). Although similar level of YAP and its
mutants was expressed (Fig. 5C), signiﬁcantly reduced levels of
CTGF or Cyr61 mRNA were detected in YAP-5SD-TX-MCF10A
(Fig. 5D). Together, these experiments clearly demonstrate that
phosphorylation of YAP by Cdk1 after taxol treatment reduced
its ability to interact with transcription factor TEAD and transactivate its downstream genes important for taxol response.
Effect of YAP phosphorylation on its ability to inhibit
antitubulin drug-induced apoptosis
Previous studies have shown that overexpression of YAP
inhibits taxol-induced apoptosis in MCF10A cells (13). To test
whether YAP phosphorylation has any effect on its ability to
reduce taxol-induced apoptosis, we have established MCF10A
cells stably expressing WPI vector, YAP-WT, YAP-5SA-TX, or
YAP-5SD-TX (Fig. 5C). Most interestingly, although both YAPWT and YAP-5SA-TX cause morphologic changes from
epithelial (normal cell–cell contact, high epithelial marker
E-cadherin, and low mesenchymal marker vimentin) to mesenchymal phenotype (loss of cell–cell contact, reduced Ecadherin, and increased vimentin) as previously observed
(13), YAP-5SD-TX mutant fails to cause signiﬁcant morpho-

logic changes (Fig. 6A–C). Most signiﬁcantly, consistent to
morphologic changes, analysis of apoptosis by Western blot
analysis of cPARP and Trypan blue exclusion assay all showed
that compared with WT and YAP-5SA-TX, YAP-5SD-TX has
signiﬁcant decreased ability to inhibit apoptosis induced by
both taxol and vinblastine (Fig. 6D and E), two commonly used
antitubulin drugs for cancer treatments. On the other hand,
YAP-WT and YAP-5SD-TX have similar antiapoptotic effect in
response to non-antitubulin drug, cisplatin (Supplementary
Fig. S4), suggesting that YAP is only phosphorylated and
inactivated during antitubulin drug response.

Discussion
Although tremendous progress has been made toward our
understanding of the roles of the Hippo pathway in tumorigenesis, size control, and stem cell renewal and differentiation
(8–11), its function in chemotherapeutic drug response is
largely unknown (23). We and others have recently provided
initial evidence that the core components of the Hippo pathway, LATS1/2, YAP, and TAZ, may be involved in the response
of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs such as taxol (14, 24–
26). However, the upstream signaling pathway(s) or gene(s)
transducing signals from drug treatment to the Hippo pathway
remain elusive. In this study, we have shown for the ﬁrst time
that Cdk1 is a novel kinase responsible for inactivation of YAP
during antitubulin drug-induced apoptosis. We found that YAP
is speciﬁcally phosphorylated in ﬂoating apoptotic cells rather
than adherent survival cells after antitubulin drug treatment
(Fig. 1A and B). Signiﬁcantly, we have shown that activated
Cdk1 can directly phosphorylate YAP both in vitro and in vivo,
which subsequently caused reduced cotransactivating and
antiapoptotic activity of YAP. Although many genes have been
identiﬁed to affect the sensitivity of cancer cells to antitubulin
chemotherapeutics and it is well known that aberrant activation of Cdk1/Cyclin B is critical for antitubulin drug-induced
apoptosis (20, 21), only a few genes are identiﬁed to be directly
phosphorylated and regulated by Cdk1/Cyclin B (21, 27).
Therefore, our studies provide the ﬁrst biologic evidence that
the Hippo core component YAP is a sensor for Cdk1 kinase
activity and a critical link coupling Cdk1 activation to antitubulin drug-induced apoptosis.
Although the Hippo pathway (Mst1/2-LATS1/2-YAP/TAZ)
has been shown to play important roles in many biologic
processes, mounting evidence suggested that Hippo-independent pathways upstream of YAP/TAZ might be also important.
For example, it was recently shown that YAP and TAZ are
activated by cell shape, cytoskeletal, and mechanical cues
independent of its upstream kinases Mst1/2 and LATS1/2
(11, 28, 29). Therefore, it has been suggested that YAP and
TAZ are central players of the Hippo pathway and different
stimuli may induce various biologic changes by regulating
YAP/TAZ through multiple signaling pathways (30). In this
study, we have identiﬁed another novel Hippo-independent
pathway modulating YAP. In this pathway, antitubulin drugs
induce microtubule tension by causing increased microtubule
polymerization or depolymerization (2, 21), which subsequently causes increased Cyclin B levels (Fig. 4F) and activation of

Cdk1 kinase (Fig. 1D). Activated Cdk1 in turn phosphorylates
YAP on ﬁve sites (S128, S138, S217, S289, and S367), which
inactivate YAP function as a transcriptional coactivator and an
antiapoptotic protein, leading to apoptotic cell death.
Although TAZ is a paralog of YAP and has overlapping
function in various biologic functions (8), it is still unclear
why YAP and TAZ have different response to antitubulin drug
treatment. As shown in Fig. 1D, while YAP is phosphorylated
only in mitotic arrested and apoptotic cells as indicated by
reduced pCdk1 and increased cPARP, TAZ is phosphorylated
and degraded in all apoptotic cells induced by almost all of the
chemotherapeutics used independent of mitotic arrest, suggesting that YAP and TAZ may function differently in response
to taxol. In addition, we also found that TAZ phosphorylation/
degradation is signiﬁcantly blocked in Cdk1 knockdown HeLa
cells after taxol treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2A). These
ﬁndings suggest that TAZ may be involved in apoptosis in
Cdk1-dependent and/or Cdk1-independent pathways.
Most interestingly, three (S138, S289, and S367) out of ﬁve
Cdk1 phosphorylation sites in YAP identiﬁed in our studies
have already been identiﬁed previously in a mass spectrometry
mapping of YAP phosphorylation sites under physiologic
conditions (31). Because Cdk1/Cyclin B kinase complex is also
activated during G2–M phase of the cell cycle, it is possible that
YAP is phosphorylated by Cdk1 during mitosis. It will be very
interesting to further study whether YAP is differentially

www.aacrjournals.org

phosphorylated during mitosis and under microtubule damage induced by antitubulin drugs. Moreover, we have found
that phosphorylation of YAP abolishes its ability to induce
morphologic changes such as EMT indicated by reduced Ecadherin and enhanced vimentin (Fig. 6A–C). Because there is
a strong link between EMT and drug resistance (32), it is
possible that phosphorylation and inactivation of YAP by Cdk1
may compromise its ability to trans-activate another transcription factor that suppresses E-cadherin and induces EMT.
Moreover, because EMT plays important roles in stem cell
renewal, cell migration, anoikis, invasion, and metastasis
(33, 34), it will be also interesting to further explore how
phosphorylation of YAP under physiologic condition regulates
these important biologic processes.
In this study, we have established YAP as an antiapoptotic
protein important for antitubulin drug resistance. We have
shown that overexpression of YAP-WT and its phosphorylation mutant YAP-5SA-TX rather than its phosphomimic
mutant YAP-5SD-TX causes resistance of MCF10A mammary
cells to both taxol and vinblastine (Fig. 6D and E). Compared
with YAP-WT, similar resistance to antitubulin drugs was
found for YAP-5SA-TX in MCF10A cells. Because high levels of
both YAP-WT and YAP-5SA-TX are expressed in MCF10A
cells, most of the overexpressed YAP-WT and YAP-5SA-TX
proteins may not be phosphorylated and inactivated by
endogenous Cdk1, which protects MCF10A cells from

undergoing apoptosis. On the other hand, most of the phosphorylation mimicking YAP-5SD-TX proteins are already
inactivated and have compromised antiapoptotic activity,
which results in reduced protection from antitubulin druginduced apoptosis. In addition, by using established taxolresistant SK-BR3 breast cancer cells and their counterparts,
we have found that YAP is not phosphorylated after taxol
treatment in drug-resistant SK-BR3 cells (Figs. 1H and 3G),
suggesting that resistance to Cdk1-induced YAP phosphorylation may be also important for taxol resistance in breast
cancer. These ﬁndings have important clinical implications.
Further examination of the relationship between the levels
and phosphorylation status of YAP and the survival of clinical
cancer patients before and after treatment with antitubulin
drugs using tissues derived from patient with cancer will
ﬁnally establish YAP and pYAP as prognostic biomarkers for
predicting the sensitivity of patients with cancer to antitubulin drugs and potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of drug-resistant patients with cancer in the future.
