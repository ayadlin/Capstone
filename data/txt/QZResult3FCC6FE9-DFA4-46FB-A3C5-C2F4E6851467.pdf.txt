Abstract
Trastuzumab treatment has improved the overall survival of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer patients.
However, many of these patients will eventually become resistant to treatment. The mechanisms that contribute to resistance to trastuzumab are unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that targeting of the
FKHR transcription factor FOXO1A in HER2-overexpressing breast tumor cells can overcome the trastuzumab
resistance in vitro. We have shown that overexpression of HER2 leads to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and subsequent inactivation of FOXO1A in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer
cells SKBR3, BT474, and MCF7-HER2. In wild-type SKBR3 and BT474 cells, trastuzumab downregulates active
Akt and increases FOXO1A expression that leads to increase in p27kip1 and decrease in cyclin D1 and finally
inhibits cell proliferation. In contrast, the effect of trastuzumab was eliminated by the reduction of FOXO1A in
HER2-overexpressing cells with constitutively active Akt1 (SKBR3/AA28 and BT474/AA9). The downregulation
of FOXO1A resulted in nuclear export of p27kip1. Blocking the constitutively active Akt by a specific Akt/
protein kinase B signaling inhibitor-2 (API-2) significantly increased FOXO1A expression and rendered the
cells more responsive to trastuzumab-induced growth inhibition. Reactivation of FOXO1A by stable or transient transfection also restored the growth-inhibitory effects of trastuzumab in SKBR3/AA28, BT474/AA9, and
MCF7-HER2 cells. Knocking down FOXO1A by small interfering RNA resulted in reducing trastuzumabinduced growth inhibition. In summary, trastuzumab can inhibit proliferation of HER2-overexpressing breast
cancer cells by reactivating FOXO1A through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. FOXO1A may therefore serve
as a target for HER2-overexpressing breast tumors. Cancer Res; 70(13); 5475–85. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Overexpression of HER2 has been shown in 20% to 30% of
patients with breast cancer. The overall survival and the time
to relapse for patients whose tumors overexpress HER2
are significantly shorter (1, 2). The malignant phenotypes
are also enhanced with HER2 overexpression (3, 4). Clinical
and translational studies from our own laboratory and others
have shown that an increased level of plasma HER2 in breast
cancer patients is associated with poor outcome and reduction in disease-free survival (5). HER2-overexpressing tumors
are more likely to be resistant to treatment with tamoxifen
and standard chemotherapy (6–8).
Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is designed to target the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor and block its function
(9). In patients with metastatic breast cancer who over-

express HER2, trastuzumab has been found to be clinically
beneficial as first-line chemotherapy (10, 11). However, the
response rates to trastuzumab monotherapy range from
12% to 34% for a median duration of 9 months only (12). Although current treatment regimens combining trastuzumab
with the taxane paclitaxel (13, 14) or docetaxel (15) increase
response rates, >70% of patients with overexpressing
HER2, however, show no response to treatment (16). Many
possible mechanisms have been proposed to account for
the therapeutic effects of trastuzumab (17), including
down-modulation of the HER2 receptor (9), interaction with
immune system and enhancing cytotoxic activity of tumorspecific CTLs (9, 18), activation of apoptotic signals (19),
and inhibition of HER2 receptor downstream signal transduction pathway (9, 20).
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its associated protein kinase B (Akt) pathway have been shown to be
one of the important downstream signaling pathways that
play a critical role toward antiapoptosis and pathogenesis
of cancer (21). The activation of Akt results in the downstream regulation of target molecules: glycogen synthase
kinase-3 (GSK-3; ref. 22), caspase-9 (23), proapoptotic Bcl-2
family member Bad (24), and FOXO (forkhead box O; forkhead members of the O subclass) family of transcription
factors (21). The final outcome may result in cellular proliferation or antiapoptosis (25, 26). The FOXO family of transcription factors, consisting of FOXO1, FOXO3a, FOXO4,
and FOXO6, is a direct phosphorylation target of the protein
kinase Akt (27, 28).

The cell lines derived from patients who were resistant to
trastuzumab treatment have shown upregulation of Akt (29).
Activation of Akt followed by loss of p27kip1 could be one of
the mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance (30). FOXO1A has
been suggested as a tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer (31). Data suggest that FOXO1A is inactivated due to
chromosomal deletion and/or transcriptional downregulation (31). It plays a positive role in cell differentiation by interacting with other signaling pathways (31–33). The present
study was designed to understand the role of Akt mediation
of FOXO1A in response to trastuzumab treatment and
mechanisms of trastuzumab actions in inhibiting the HER2
receptors and their downstream events.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and antibodies
The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology; heregulin β-1 was bought from
NeoMarkers, and trastuzumab was received as a gift from
Genentech. The following antibodies were used and their
source is indicated: anti–phospho-Akt (pAkt; Ser473), antiAkt, anti–phospho-GSK-3β (pGSK-3β), and p27kip1 from Cell
Signaling Technology; anti-phosphotyrosine, anti–cyclin D1,
anti-ErbB2-Neu, and anti–c-erbB3 from Oncogene Science;
FOXO1A antibody from Abcam; and anti–β-actin from Sigma.
Cell lines and cell culture
Human breast cancer cell lines SKBR3 and BT474 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Unless
otherwise stated, monolayer cultures of SKBR3 and BT474
cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal
bovine serum. MCF7-HER2 and MCF7-neo cells (MCF7 cells
transfected with HER2 and empty vector) were kind gift from
Dr. Kent Osborne (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX).
SKBR3/AA28 and BT474/AA9 cells were generated by
transfection of Myr-Akt1 in SKBR3 and BT474 cells; SKBR3/
DN9 and BT474/DN5 cells were created by transfection of
dominant-negative Akt1 in SKBR3 and BT474; and SKBR3/
V33 and BT474/V were generated by transfection of
pUSEamp(+) vector in SKBR3 and BT474 (Supplementary
Figs. S1-2).
The transfected cells were maintained in growth media
with 400 μg/mL G418.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with iCycler iQ
Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using SYBR Green Master Mix (Qiagen). The mRNA levels of
Akt1, HER2/neu (HER2), and FOXO1A were quantified by
measuring the threshold cycle (Ct) and adjusted with the
level of 18S for each sample.
Overexpressing FOXO1A
Overexpressing FOXO1A was done by either transient
transfection or stable transfection of the 2-kb pcDNA3 Flag
FKHR (pcDNA3 Flag FOXO1A; Addgene plasmid 13507;
ref. 33) into the cells. Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen)

5476

was used for transfection following the manufacturer's
instruction.
Short hairpin RNA/small interfering RNA transfection
The HER2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and negative control shRNA were expression Arrest shRNA constructs, cloned
into pSHAG-MAGIC2c (pSM2c) retroviral vector, and purchased from Open Biosystems (Supplementary Fig. S1). The
plasmid DNA was prepared by using a kit for plasmid DNA
extraction (Ultrapure, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transfection was performed by using
Arrest-in transfection reagent (Open Biosystems) following
the manufacturer's instructions.
The FOXO1A was knocked down by transfecting chemically synthesized small interfering RNA (siRNA) of FOXO1A (ID
s5259; Ambion) into the cells. The siPORT NeoFX reagent
(Ambion) was used for transfection following the manufacturer's instructions.
The HER2 and FOXO1A mRNA expression after shRNA/
siRNA knockdown were determined by quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) at 48 to 72 hours of transfection.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
Cells were either treated with trastuzumab at 10 μg/mL
for 72 hours or preincubated with different PI3K or Akt inhibitors for 16 hours and then treated with trastuzumab. The
growth medium containing trastuzumab was refreshed every
24 hours. For immunoblot analysis, total protein (30–50 μg)
from cell lysates was used, and for immunoprecipitations,
250 μg of protein from whole-cell lysates were used.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence was performed by incubating the
slides with FITC or Texas red fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 minutes and then mounted with
Vectashield mounting medium. The cells with positive staining were counted in five different areas under a fluorescence
microscope and adjusted with total number of cells using
DigiPro software (Labomed, Inc.).
Statistical analysis
The values were expressed as mean ± SD and/or mean fold
change. The statistical significances of mean values among
different cell lines were determined by one-way ANOVA first
and then by Student's t test. P value of ≤0.05 was considered
significant for ANOVA test. P value of ≤0.01 was considered
significant for Student's t test.

Results
FOXO1A expression is regulated by PI3K/Akt pathway
We first examined the constitutive expression of FOXO1A
in HER2-overexpressing cells SKBR3 [estrogen receptor
(ER) negative], BT474 (ER positive), and MCF7-HER2 (ER
positive); HER2 moderately expressing cells MCF7 (ER positive); and nontumorigenic breast cells MCF12A. The constitutive expression of FOXO1A was lower in all breast cancer
cells than that in nontumorigenic breast cells MCF12A.

FOXO1A Is a Target for HER2-Overexpressing Breast Tumor

HER2-overexpressing cells SKBR3, BT474, and MCF7-HER2
had lower FOXO1A compared with HER2 moderately expressing cells MCF7 (Fig. 1A). Conversely, the pAkt was higher in
the HER2-overexpressing cells than that in MCF7 (Fig. 1A,
bottom). We then used SKBR3 cells to examine the regulation of FOXO1A gene expression by different growth factors.
FOXO1A expression decreased significantly in response to
heregulin (HRG) treatment. Similarly, epidermal growth factor (EGF) also reduced FOXO1A expression compared with
untreated cells (Fig. 1B). EGF can lead to an efficient signaling complex that can enhance PI3K signal transduction pathway (34). In contrast, FOXO1A expression did not change
significantly in response to insulin-like growth factor-I
(IGF-I). Similarly, Fig. 1C shows that HRG induces phosphorylation of HER3 receptor and formation of HER3/HER2 protein complex and further phosphorylates HER2 receptor in
SKBR3 cells. This results in activation of pAkt, whereas total
Akt levels did not change (Fig. 1C). The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin increased FOXO1A expression significantly (Fig. 1A).

Surprisingly, LY294002 (40 μmol/L), another PI3K inhibitor,
did not restore FOXO1A expression significantly. Figure 1C
confirms that wortmannin treatment completely blocks pAkt
expression and inhibits HRG-induced SKBR3 cell proliferation (Fig. 1D).
Effect of downregulating HER2 gene on pAkt and
FOXO1A expression
Faltus and colleagues (35) showed that silencing the HER2 gene
by siRNA/shRNA inhibits proliferation of HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells. Using a similar approach, we transfected
shHER2 into SKBR3 cells and tested the hypothesis that
downregulation of HER2 receptors results in decrease in
pAkt and increase in FOXO1A expression. As expected, after
72 hours of shHER2 transfection, HER2 mRNA level decreased in SKBR3 cells and this was associated with decrease
in HER2 extracellular membrane receptor expression
(Fig. 2A). SKBR3 cells transfected with shHER2 showed a decrease in pAkt but not total Akt (Fig. 2B). Nontransfected

in five different areas and adjusted with positive β-actin labeling cells. D, left, immunofluorescence with FITC-labeled anti-HER2 antibody indicated
increased HER2 membrane receptor (green, indicated by white arrows) in MCF7-HER2 cells.

SKBR3 cells had FOXO1A expression mainly in the cytoplasmic and membrane regions (Fig. 2C, left, a–c). However, on
shHER2 transfection, there was a significant increase in nuclear uptake of FOXO1A (Fig. 2D, left, d–f). FOXO1A nuclear
protein expression increased by ∼25% after silencing HER2
gene with shHER2 (Fig. 2C, right).
To further confirm these results, pAkt and FOXO1A expression was examined in MCF7-overexpressing HER2 cells,
MCF7-HER2, and compared with MCF7 transfected with
empty vector, MCF7-neo cells. Figure 2D shows that MCF7HER2 cells had significant increase in HER2 receptor and

upregulated pAkt expression than that in MCF7-neo. The
phosphorylated FOXO1 was increased and total FOXO1A
was decreased in MCF7-HER2 compared with MCF7-neo
(Fig. 2D).
Data from Fig. 2 suggest that FOXO1A expression is inversely related to active Akt (pAkt), suggesting that tumors
with activated Akt will have low levels of FOXO1A and this
may contribute to resistance to therapy. The elevated Akt1
kinase activity has been shown to be important for development and proliferation of human cancers, including breast
cancer (25). Several laboratories have used either transient

FOXO1A Is a Target for HER2-Overexpressing Breast Tumor

Akt transfection (36) or stably transfected Akt cell models. To
understand the mechanisms associated with decrease in
FOXO1A in relation to increased Akt1 in HER2-overexpressing
cells, we created stable cell transfectants with either myrAkt1
(active Akt1) or K179M (dominant-negative mutant) Akt1
(DNAkt1). The empty vector, pUSEamp(+), was also transfected. The stable transfectants have been confirmed by RTPCR and sequencing analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Protein
level of Akt1 expression was also analyzed by Western blot
analysis with antibodies against pAkt (Ser473) and total Akt
for all positive clones. SKBR3 transfected with myrAkt1 clones

(SKBR3/AA28, SKBR3/AA29, and SKBR3/AA9) showed a significant increase in pAkt (Ser473) compared with vectortransfected clone (SKBR3/V33) or dominant-negative K179M
Akt transfectants (SKBR3/DN8 and SKBR3/DN9) but did not
change in total Akt expression (Supplementary Fig. S2). Similar to investigations on wild-type SKBR3 cells (Fig. 2), we examined FOXO1A and p27kip1 protein expression in SKBR3
cells with activated Akt (SKBR3/AA28) and treated with
shHER2. Figure 3A shows that FOXO1A protein expression
decreased significantly in SKBR3/AA28 and increased in
SKBR3/DN9 slightly compared with SKBR3 and SKBR3/V33

cells. Immunohistochemistry analysis further confirmed loss
of nuclear FOXO1A in SKBR3/AA28 (Fig. 3A, bottom).
Decrease in FOXOA1 in Akt activated cells results
in decreased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor
protein p27
p27kip1, a member of the Kip family of cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors, plays an important role in cell cycle arrest
(37). Its promoter activity has been associated with FOXO1A
and FOXO3 (38, 39). Cytoplasmic translocation of p27kip1 has
been increasingly recognized to be associated with an aggressive phenotype of tumors, whereas nuclear expression confers a more favorable outcome (40). Data from our current
study show that total p27kip1 protein expression was significantly decreased in SKBR3/AA28 cells (Fig. 3B). As shown in
Fig. 3B, p27kip1 was present in both nuclear and cytoplasm of
SKBR3/V33 and SKBR3/DN9 cells. In contrast, p27kip1 was
exclusively localized in the cytoplasm of SKBR3/AA28 cells
(Fig. 3B).
To further confirm if FOXO1A influences the expression of
p27kip1, the full-length FOXO1A gene was transfected into
MCF7-HER2 cells. The FOXO1A mRNA level was significantly
increased in the FOXO1A-transfected MCF7-HER2 cells
(MCF7-HER2/FOXO1A), and FOXO1A in MCF7-HER2/FOXO1A
cells was exclusively located in the nucleus (Fig. 3C). Figure
3C shows that the p27kip1 protein was mainly expressed in
the nucleus in MCF7 cells; however, it was translocated in
both nuclear and cytoplasmic space in MCF7-HER2 cells.
Overexpressing FOXO1A in the MCF7-HER2 cells (MCF7HER2/FOXO1A) restored the nuclear expression of p27kip1
protein (Fig. 3C).
Effect of shHER2 transfection on HER2 mRNA, HER2
protein, and pAkt expression on SKBR3/AA28 cells
Our data from Fig. 3D confirm downregulation of HER2
mRNA and HER2 receptor protein by shHER2 treatment. However, in contrast to the SKBR3 cells (Fig. 2B), pAkt expression
in SKBR3/AA28 cells (Fig. 3D) did not decrease significantly.
Sensitivity to trastuzumab was affected by the
reduction of FOXO1A and activation of Akt
SKBR3 cells with pAkt overexpression (SKBR3/AA28)
showed activated levels of pGSK-3β and cyclin D1 (Fig. 4A).
These cells did not respond to trastuzumab. In contrast,
wild-type SKBR3, vector-transfected SKBR3 (V33), and dominant-negative Akt (DN9) cells responded favorably to trastuzumab, with respect to downregulation of pAkt, pGSK-3β,
and cyclin D1 (Fig. 4A). Cell growth measured by MTT assay
further confirmed that unlike vector-transfected (SKBR3/
V33) and dominant-negative Akt-transfected (DN9) cells,
SKBR3/AA28 cells were relatively resistant to time-dependent
trastuzumab treatment (Fig. 4A, right). Similar results were
observed in BT474 cells transfected with myrAkt1 (BT474/
AA9) and dominant-negative Akt1 (BT474/DN5). As shown
in Fig. 4B, BT474/AA9 showed less response to trastuzumab
treatment with respect to downregulation of pAkt and cell
growth inhibition compared with BT474/V (vector transfection only) and BT474/DN5.

Figure 4C confirms that trastuzumab-resistant (SKBR3/
AA28 and BT474/AA9) cells did not show a difference in
FOXO1A mRNA and protein expression on trastuzumab
treatment. In contrast, wild-type SKBR3 and BT474 cells responded to trastuzumab with a significant increase in both
mRNA and protein expression of FOXO1A. Next, we examined if p27kip1, a universal cell cycle inhibitor, was associated
with FOXO1A expression in trastuzumab-responsive and
trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cells. Figure 4D shows that in
wild-type SKBR3 cells, p27kip1 was upregulated together with
FOXOA1 in response to trastuzumab treatment. In contrast,
p27kip1 expression did not change in trastuzumab-resistant
SKBR3/AA28 cells.
Effect of trastuzumab after inhibiting the
PI3K/Akt pathway
Figure 5A shows that pAkt expression was blocked completely in wild-type SKBR3 cells treated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or API-2. API-2 has been reported to be a
highly selective inhibitor of Akt signaling in human tumor
cells with aberrant Akt, leading to decrease in cell growth
and induction of apoptosis (41). Trastuzumab partially
downregulated pAkt. However, in combination with
LY294002, the pAkt expression was completely blocked. Similarly, alone or in combination with API-2, the pAkt expression was completely blocked. However, neither LY294002
(Fig. 5B) nor wortmannin (data not shown) caused significant inhibition of pAkt and pGSK-3β in SKBR3/AA28 cells.
Subsequently, addition of trastuzumab in combination with
LY294002 also had no effect on pAkt and pGSK-3β. However,
treatment with API-2 caused a partial downregulation of
both pAkt and pGSK-3β (Fig. 5B). Addition of trastuzumab
with API-2 completely inhibited pAkt and pGSK-3β. Figure
5C shows that API-2 treatment can significantly upregulate
FOXOA1 mRNA levels in both wild-type SKBR3 and trastuzumabresistant SKBR3/AA28 cells. These observations provide
further evidence that by inhibiting pAkt, FOXOA1 gets upregulated and makes these cells more responsive to trastuzumab (Fig. 5D).
Overexpressing FOXO1A restored the sensitivity of
trastuzumab in HER2- and pAkt-overexpressing cells
Figure 6A shows that FOXO1A mRNA level increased by
3.1-fold in SKBR3/AA28 cells transfected with full-length
FOXO1A gene for 3 days compared with cells transfected
with empty vector only. MTT growth assay in Fig. 6A (left)
showed that SKBR3/AA28 cells transfected with pcDNA3 vector alone did not change the cell growth between treated and
untreated cells. However, cells transfected with FOXO1A
showed increased sensitivity to trastuzumab, and its sensitivity to trastuzumab was at the same level as wild-type SKBR3
cells. We also investigated if transfecting FOXO1A gene in
wild-type SKBR3 (HER2-overexpressing cells) would have
any additional benefit with reference to trastuzumab sensitivity and HER2 mRNA levels. After clonal selection, quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm the presence of FOXOA1.
Figure 6A shows that FOXOA1 mRNA levels increased by
3.0-fold in FOXO1A transfectant SKBR3/FOXO1A-3 cells

indicated day (A) and in BT474, BT474/AA9, and BT474/DN5 cells at day 3 (B). Each time point is mean of six determinations. *, P < 0.05, compared

compared with vector only–transfected cells (SKBR3/
pcDNA3). Furthermore, MTT assay showed that after 3 days
of trastuzumab treatment, cell growth was inhibited by 18%
in SKBR3; however, this inhibition increased to 31% in
FOXOA1-transfected SKBR3/FOXO1A-3 cells (Fig. 6A, left).
An interesting outcome of FOXOA1 transfection in HER2overexpressing SKBR3 cells was the significant downregulation of HER2 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2). To further
show that the importance of FOXOA regulation is not specific to SKBR3 cell line only, the full-length FOXO1A gene was
also transfected into the relatively resistant trastuzumab
cells, BT474/AA9. Figure 6B shows that cell growth was significantly inhibited by trastuzumab, consistent with increase

in FOXO1A mRNA expression in the BT474/AA9 cells transfected with FOXO1A. In contrast to BT474/AA9 cells, the
BT474/DN5 cells were more sensitive to trastuzumab. However, the BT474/DN5 cells became less responsive to trastuzumab after FOXO1A knockdown. The FOXO1A expression
was significantly decreased in BT474/DN5 cells transfected
with siRNA-FOXO1A, and trastuzumab was not able to inhibit the cell growth in the FOXO1A knockdown BT474/DN5
cells (Fig. 6B). Similar experiments were performed in
MCF7-HER2 cells. Figure 6C shows that cell growth inhibition was increased by trastuzumab in MCF7-HER2 with
full-length FOXO1A transfection and decreased in the knockdown FOXO1A MCF7-HER2 cells (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Activation of PI3K/Akt pathway and subsequent inactivation of FOXO transcription factors have been observed in different cancers (27, 31). Recent clinical and translational
studies from our laboratory and others have clearly shown
that breast cancer patients with HER2-positive tumors have
greater potential to increase pAkt expression in their tumors
(42–44). An increase in tissue pAkt expression in HER2overexpressing breast cancer patient leads to poor disease
outcome with significant decrease in 5-year disease-free survival rate (42). Hence, therapeutic targeting of the PI3K/Akt
pathway offers the opportunity to improve disease-free and
overall survival in these HER2-overexpressing breast cancer
patients. Current targets for PI3K/Akt are fairly effective
in vitro but show significant toxicity in vivo. Hence, there is
a need to identify additional or alternate targets associated
with PI3K/Akt signaling cascade.
FOXO transcriptional factors, especially FOXO3 and
FOXO1, are regulated by PI3K/Akt pathway (45). Deregula-

tion of FOXO3 or FOXO1 has been found in different cancers,
including breast, prostate, chronic myelogenous leukemia,
glioblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and leukemia (27, 45).
The deregulated FOXOs have been reported to contribute
to resistance to paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cisplatin treatment (46–48).
Our current study clearly shows that FOXO1A is regulated
by the PI3K/Akt pathway in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Overexpression of active Akt leads to decrease in
FOXO1A expression and nuclear export of p27kip1. Trastuzumab blocks HER2 receptor and downregulates pAkt and
downstream molecules. The downregulation of pAkt by trastuzumab results to reactivation of FOXO1A that leads to increase in p27kip1, culminates in decrease in cell cycle protein
such as cyclin D1, and finally inhibits cell proliferation. Trastuzumab, however, was not able to completely downregulate
the activated pAkt in SKBR3/AA28 and BT474/AA9. Trastuzumab also failed to increase FOXO1A in those cells and,
consequently, p27kip1 expression in SKBR3/AA28. With respect to cell proliferation, SKBR3/AA28 and BT474/AA9 cells

showed lesser sensitivity to trastuzumab. In contrast,
cells expressing dominant-negative Akt1 (SKBR3/DN9 and
BT474/DN5) showed more sensitivity to growth inhibition
by trastuzumab.
In addition to the PI3K inhibitors, we also examined the
effect of Akt/protein kinase B inhibitor-2 (API-2) on inhibition of pAkt in HER2- and Akt1-overexpressing SKBR3
cells. API-2 was first identified to inhibit cell growth in
Akt2-transformed but not empty vector LXSN-transfected
NIH3T3 cells (49, 50). Later, it was shown to suppress pAkt
level without inhibition of PI3K (41). Here, we report that
API-2 inhibits pAkt expression significantly in SKBR3/AA28

and caused downregulation of FOXO1A, resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation.
Our data show that inactivation of FOXO1A by activated
Akt increases breast cancer cell survival and inhibits the apoptotic properties of trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing
cells. To address the question that overexpression of FOXO1A
can overcome resistance or increase sensitivity to trastuzumab, we used stable transfection as well as transient transfection strategies that overexpressed FOXO1A into both
SKBR3 and SKBR3/AA28 cells. We observed significant
increase in sensitivity to trastuzumab-induced growth inhibition in both SKBR3 and SKBR3/AA28 cells transfected with

Figure 6. Overexpressing FOXO1A restores the sensitivity of trastuzumab. Full-length FOXO1A gene was transiently transfected into SKBR3/AA28 (A),
BT474/AA9 (B), and MCF7-HER2 (C) cells for 72 h and stably transfected into SKBR3 (A) cells. The FOXO1A was knocked down by transfected
siRNA-FOXO1A into BT474/DN9 (B) and MCF7-HER2 (C) cells for 72 h. The mRNA level of FOXO1A in the transfectants was determined by quantitative
RT-PCR with FOXO1A primers and adjusted by 18S. Each bar was mean of three determinations. *, P < 0.05, compared with untransfected cells using
ANOVA analysis. Cell growth in the same transfectants treated with and without trastuzumab was examined by MTT assay and compared with untreated
cells. Each bar was mean of six determinations. *, P < 0.05, compared with untreated cells using ANOVA analysis.

FOXOA1. To further confirm that the treatment with trastuzumab leading to decreased HER2-mediated cell proliferation is associated with FOXO1 regulation and is not only
specific to ER-negative cell line SKBR3, we overexpressed
FOXO1A into HER2-overexpressing cells with ER-positive
BT474/AA9 and MCF7-HER2 cells. A significant increase in
sensitivity to trastuzumab-induced growth inhibition was observed in both BT474/AA9 and MCF7-HER2 cells transfected
with FOXO1A. In contrast, the BT474/DN5 and MCF7-HER2
cells with siRNA knockdown FOXO1A became resistant to
trastuzumab. Furthermore, SKBR3 cells with stable FOXOA1
transfection showed a significant decrease in their HER2
mRNA levels compared with vector only–transfected and parental SKBR3 cells. This observation suggests that FOXO1A
may transcriptionally regulate HER2 gene expression in
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. The mechanism(s)

by which FOXO1A transcription factor may regulate HER2
gene needs to be investigated further.
