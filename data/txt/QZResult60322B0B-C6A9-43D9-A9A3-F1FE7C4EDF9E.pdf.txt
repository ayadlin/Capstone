BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to evaluate the maximum tolerable dose of weekly gemcitabine
administered simultaneously with radiation and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). METHODS: Patients with stage IIIA/B NSCLC received concurrently 63 grays radiation and 20 mg/m2
cisplatin Day 1 to 3 in Weeks 1 and 5, plus weekly gemcitabine at escalating doses (150-700 mg/m2) on Fridays after
radiation to avoid radiosensitization. The authors assessed dose-limiting toxicities according to Common Toxicity
Criteria. The primary endpoint was maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine. Tumor resectability, survival, and
disease-free survival (DFS) were also determined. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were accrued, of whom 95% received
radiation and 66% cisplatin as above. Weekly doses of gemcitabine were escalated to 700 mg/m2. Grade 3 dysphagia
and 1 case of fatal, probably treatment-related pulmonary deterioration established the MTD of gemcitabine at
550 mg/m2 weekly. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery, and histopathological complete regression was documented in 26% of these patients. Overall, median actuarial survival and DFS were 23.8 and 12.4 months, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine at doses up to 550 mg/m2 weekly can be given simultaneously with radiation and
cisplatin to patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Radical resection thereafter is feasible. The impact of this aggresC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Despite progress in the treatment of locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), most patients still have an

unfavorable prognosis. Escalation of overall treatment intensity1-4 and the combination of different treatments modalities
might improve outcome.5 Enhanced toxicity may, however, compromise the simultaneous application of different
aggressive modalities.
Cisplatin has been shown to improve outcome of patients with locally advanced NSCLC who receive radiotherapy,6-8 and primary radiochemotherapy has become standard treatment for such patients. More recently, single-agent
gemcitabine yielded encouraging response rates at favorable toxicity.9,10 Gemcitabine also has radiosensitizing effects,11,12
but there have been reports of substantial toxicity when gemcitabine was administered simultaneously with radiation.13
Here we demonstrate that 6 weekly doses of gemcitabine at 550 mg/m2 can be given concomitant with 63 grays
(Gy) radiation and cisplatin (20 mg/m2 given Day 1 to 3 in Weeks 1 and 5) to patients with locally advanced NSCLC.

chest and abdomen, bone scan, lung function and blood
tests. Tumor stage was determined according to the 1992
criteria of the International Union Against Cancer. The
study was conducted in a single center and had a phase 1/
2 dose escalation design.
The protocol was conceptualized in 1999 at the
Flims Workshop ‘‘Methods in Clinical Cancer Research’’
in collaboration with the Federation of European Cancer
Societies, the American Association for Cancer Research,
and the American Society of Clinical Oncology. It was
approved by the local ethics committee, and written
informed consent was obtained from each patient.
Objectives
The primary objective was to determine the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine given simultaneously with potentially curative radiation and cisplatin.
Secondary objectives were surgical resectability, overall
survival, and disease-free survival (DFS).
Study Procedures
We administered gemcitabine intravenously weekly over
30 minutes for 6 weeks during radiotherapy; the drug was
given on Fridays after the radiation dose for that day.
Gemcitabine was escalated after treatment of cohorts of 3
consecutive patients if they did not experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and if they had been observed for at
least 6 weeks after treatment (to detect radiation-induced
pneumonitis). The first cohort received 150 mg/m2. Subsequent cohorts were scheduled for 225, 300, 350, 400,
450, 500, 550, 625, 700, and 775 mg/m2. Dose-limiting
adverse events (AEs) were defined by grade 3 nonhematologic or grade 4 hematologic toxicity. If a DLT
was observed, we stopped gemcitabine but continued
radiation and cisplatin when clinically appropriate. If
there was 1 patient with DLT at a given dose level, the
cohort was increased to 6 patients. The MTD was defined
as the dose for the current cohort if DLT occurred in 1 of
6 or 2 of 6 patients or as the dose of the previous cohort if
DLT occurred in 2 of 6 or in 2 of 3 patients.
During radiotherapy, patients were assessed weekly
for clinical side effects, and laboratory values (blood
count, creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium, liver function
tests) were determined. Follow-up visits were performed
at 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks after completion of radiation
therapy, at 3-month intervals for the following 2 years,
and every 6 months thereafter. Follow-up focused on pulmonary and upper gastrointestinal abnormalities and on
tumor status. Chest x-rays were mandatory at each visit,

4834

and additional tests were performed at the discretion of
the physician.
Radiation/Cisplatin Treatment
Three-dimensional CT-based planning was performed,
and radiation was administered using multiple fields. The
clinical target volume (CTV) encompassed the primary
tumor (gross tumor volume) and usually the ipsilateral
nodal regions 10, 7, and 5 and bilateral regions 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, and 7.14 Additional regions were included when tumor
involvement was suspected. CTV was expanded to
planning target volume by 5 mm in all directions, except
to the lungs, where it was 2 mm. Anterior/posterior and
oblique beam paths were applied. Radiation oncologists
and thoracic surgeons discussed all planning to direct, if
possible, beams to lung lobes eventually scheduled for
resection and to define areas where respectability might be
limited. Radiation was delivered at 5  1.8 Gy/wk with
6 MeV and 18 MeV energy photons. The primary tumor
and enlarged nodes received 59.4 Gy, and gross disease
where resectability was limited received 63 Gy. Nodes not
involved by CT scan were treated with 50.4 Gy; 42 Gy
were allowed to the spinal cord and 15 Gy to 25% of lung
tissue.
The protocol originally scheduled 2 courses of
cisplatin, 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 to 5 in Weeks 1 and 5.
Pronounced hematologic toxicity led us to reduce cisplatin to 2 3-day courses at 20 mg/m2 after treatment of the
second patient.
Surgery
All patients were re-evaluated within 3 weeks after radiochemotherapy. Potentially operable patients had repeat
mediastinoscopy to exclude persisting N2 disease and
underwent lobectomy or pneumonectomy.
Statistical Analysis
All patients entered into the study after the protocol
amendment restricting cisplatin to 3-day courses were
analyzed for safety and efficacy. AEs were graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria. The duration of a
graded AE was determined from occurrence to resolution,
to worsening, or—in 1 case grade 2—to end of radiochemotherapy. The MTD was determined according to
the dose escalation schedule described above. Survival and
DFS times were calculated from diagnosis. DFS was
defined as time to tumor progression or death, whichever
occurred first. Progression was assumed when lesions
increased by >20% (largest diameter) as compared with

summarize other observations.

RESULTS
Patient Demographics
Forty-two eligible patients were enrolled and treated in
the Clinic for Radiotherapy at Freiburg University Clinic
from July 2000 to July 2006. Forty patients completed
radiochemotherapy. Complete follow-up until June 2009
was available for 41 patients. Patients’ demographics, disease, and baseline characteristics are detailed in Table 1.

Compliance to Protocol
Forty (95%) patients received radiation therapy as per
protocol with a total dose of 63 Gy. Two patients, 1 with
early metastases in the brain and 1 with dissemination to
cervical nodes and bones, stopped radiation at 50.4 and
54.0 Gy, respectively. Mean duration of radiotherapy was
49.5 days (median, 50; range, 37-62). Twenty-eight
(66%) patients received cisplatin as per (revised) protocol
(2 cycles of 3  20 mg/m2); 34 (81%) patients received
at least 5, 34 (86%) received 4, and 42 (100%) received
3 doses of cisplatin. Gemcitabine dose escalation was
stopped after the 700-mg/m2 cohort. Patients in all
cohorts received at least 3 doses of gemcitabine. Six and 4
patients in the 625-mg/m2 and 700-mg/m2 cohorts,
respectively, received 4 doses (Table 2).

Expansion of Treatment Cohorts
Cohorts were expanded 4 because of occurrence of
grade 4 thrombocytopenia (cohort: 150 mg/m2) and
grade 3 dysphagia (cohorts: 450, 625, and 700 mg/m2);
the latter lasted 12, 24, and 12 days and required intravenously feeding. One patient of cohort 625 mg/m2 had
leukopenia grade 4 that was not confirmed in a subsequent test and therefore not considered to be dose
limiting.
Early Deaths
Four patients died within 3 months after completing
radiochemotherapy, 2 from newly diagnosed brain
metastases. One 66-year-old patient with mild pre-existing cardiac disease died 6 weeks after radiation. He
had stage IIIA squamous cell carcinoma of the upper lobe,
and received radiation and cisplatin per protocol and

6  150 mg/m2 gemcitabine. Grade 2 nausea was
monitored for 7 days. Incomplete pneumonectomy (R2)
was performed within 5 weeks. Acute respiratory distress
syndrome developed, and the patient died 9 days after
surgery. The cause of death was considered to be related
to the surgical intervention, but might have been exacerbated by prior radiochemotherapy. A 58-year-old woman
with pre-existing moderate chronic obstructive lung and
mild hypertensive heart disease had stage IIIB paratracheal
adenocarcinoma, and received radiation per protocol,
3  20 mg/m2 cisplatin and 4  625 mg/m2 gemcitabine.
Grade 2 leukopenia and dysphagia were recorded for
2 and 7 days, respectively. She died 7 weeks after completing radiochemotherapy. Progressive pulmonary deterioration was reported by her general physician but only after
patients in the next cohort had completed treatment.
Additional examinations or autopsy of this patient were
not performed. We could not exclude radiation pneumonitis. Given this event, and the emergence of grade 3
dysphagia in cohorts at doses of 625 and 700 mg/m2
gemcitabine, we terminated further dose escalations.
Toxicity

4836

dysphagia and 1 suspected pneumonitis leading to death
in patients of the 625-mg/m2 cohort led us to define
MTD of weekly gemcitabine at 550 mg/m2.
Most patients suffered mild to moderate nausea and
dysphagia. Hematologic, liver, and renal toxicities were
mild to moderate. Overall, we observed pulmonary AEs
in 3 patients, and 2 of them died early (see above).
Another 54-year-old man with pre-existing mild gastrointestinal disease and stage IIIB centrally located adenocarcinoma received radiochemotherapy per protocol and
6  400 mg/m2 gemcitabine. Grade 3 leukopenia, grade
1 nausea, and dysphagia lasting 1, 7, and 17 days, respectively, were noted. Although not scheduled initially for
surgery, pneumonectomy with complete removal of
tumor was performed within 5 weeks without major
complications. Progressive fibrosis developed in the
remaining upper lobe of his lung and the patient needed
continuous oxygen. He died after 15 months from
esophageal bleeding.
Resectability
Sixteen of 42 patients had persisting N2 disease after
radiochemotherapy or were medically not operable.
Surgery revealed myocardial infiltration by cancer in
1 patient; he was primarily staged as IIIA and underwent

exploratory thoracotomy only. Resection of tumor and
mediastinal nodes was performed in 25 patients at a mean
time of 35 days after radiation (median, 32 days; range,
13-136). Complete removal of tumor (R0) was feasible in
11 of 13 patients with stage IIIA and 9 of 12 patients with
stage IIIB disease. R1 or R2 resections were documented
for 1 of 13 and 1 of 13 patients with stage IIIA disease and
for 2 of 12 and 1 of 12 with stage IIIB disease, respectively. Histopathological complete regression was found
in 6 (24%) of 25 patients, 3 of 13 and 3 of 12 with stages
IIIA and IIIB, respectively.
Clinical Outcome
Survival

Seven patients are alive at the time of writing this
report, 6 without active disease. Median actuarial survival
was 23.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.5-31) months
for all patients (Fig. 1), 24.3 (95% CI, 15.5-31) months
for those with stage IIIA, and 23.0 (95% CI, 15.4-43.3)
months for those with stage IIIB disease. Surgery was
associated with better survival (27.2; 95% CI, 25.7-53.6
vs 16.8; 95% CI, 9.1-24.6 months, median; P ¼ .02),
particularly when complete resection was achieved (R0 vs
R1 vs R2: 36.6; 95% CI, 15.8-84.7 vs 15.7; 95% CI, 9.01 vs 10.5; 95% CI, 3.7-1 months, median; P ¼ .48).
Patients with complete histopathological regression had a
median survival of 42.4 (95% CI, 11.4-1) months, compared with 25.0 (95% CI, 15.4-84.8) months for those
who did not, and median actuarial survival for patients
receiving 2600 mg/m2 gemcitabine was 23.1 (95% CI,
13.9-25.4) months as compared with 32.6 (95% CI,
11.4-53.6) months for those receiving higher doses. These
trends were not significant, as would be expected from the
limited number of patients included in this small trial.
DFS

Median DFS was 12.4 (95% CI, 8.9-17.9) months
(Fig. 1). Again, surgery was associated with better DFS
(14.5; 95% CI, 10.9-24.4 vs 8.3; 95% CI, 5.0-17.9
months, median; P ¼ .03), especially after complete resection (R0 vs R1 vs R2: 19.9; 95% CI, 10.9-29.4 vs 11.5;
95% CI, 8.8-1 vs 3.6; 95% CI, 3.2-1 months, median;
P ¼ .004).
Patterns of Disease Recurrence

Twenty-seven patients had recurrent disease.
Locoregional recurrence occurred at a mean of 19 months
(median, 18; range, 3-54) in 11 patients, 5 without
distant metastasis. Sixteen patients with dissemination

experienced persistent locoregional control. Surgery was
associated with reduced locoregional recurrence (4 of
26 vs 7 of 16; P ¼ .04). Metastasis was diagnosed at a
mean of 13 months (median, 11; range, 2-55) in 22
patients. Surgery was not associated with change in the
incidence of metastases (14 of 26 vs 8 of 16). We observed
first dissemination in brain, lung or pleura, liver, supraclavicular nodes, esophagus, adrenals, and bones of 10, 4, 4,
1, 1, 1, and 1 patients, respectively. Four patients had recurrence in the brain only. One of them died without
receiving further therapy. Resection and cranial irradiation were performed for the others. They were still alive at
56, 84, and 97 months, 2 without active disease or further
treatment.

DISCUSSION
Here we show that 6 weekly doses of gemcitabine at
550 mg/m2 can be given concomitant to aggressive radiochemotherapy to patients with locally advanced NSCLC
who might undergo resection. A 3-year follow-up should
be sufficient to substantiate the overall feasibility and
possible efficacy of this approach.
We intended to increase the overall treatment intensity by combining aggressive locoregional with efficient systemic treatment. Therefore, we aimed not to radiosensitize
with gemcitabine,16 but applied the drug on Fridays after a
weekly radiation course to cover the weekend radiation
breaks, a schedule that has been carried out previously.17
When administered in this way, the MTD of gemcitabine

4837

Original Article

totaled 3300 mg/m2 for a 6-week radiation/cisplatin course
and exceeded previous reports (400,18 900,19 1200,16
1500,20 1800,21 2250,22 or 240023 mg/m2).
One should, however, apply caution when comparing our data to other trials. Radiation, chemotherapy, and
surgery differ between protocols, and clinical effects
of multimodal treatments are sensitive to even minor
modifications of 1 modality. For instance, different
cytostatic compounds22 or radiation techniques19 significantly affect the MTD of gemcitabine in concomitant
radiochemotherapy.
Gemcitabine treatment concomitant to radiochemotherapy mostly coincides with hematotoxicity and adverse
reactions in lung tissue (incidence: 2%,18,21,24 14%,23
17%,20,22 24%,25 30%,26 and 33%16) and the esophagus
(incidence: 6%,16 10%,18,24 17%,26 25%,16,20 33%,19,25
43%,22 and 52%23). These data are comprehensively
reviewed elsewhere.27 We too noticed impressive esophageal
toxicity. Although documented for only 7% of our patients,
increasing and persisting dysphagia finally led us to stop
escalating gemcitabine. Furthermore, we observed 2 serious
pulmonary toxicities, both possibly related to radiochemotherapy. One pulmonary death was closely linked to the
study procedure, and another patient developed pulmonary
fibrosis requiring continuous oxygen. A third and fatal
episode of pulmonary toxicity was considered to be related
to the surgical intervention. Our 3-dimensional planning,19
narrow safety margins, and positioning of beam paths to
regions that were subsequently resected may have limited
radiation burden to healthy lung and possibly circumvented
more pronounced toxicity. All other side effects that we
observed were mild to moderate.
Although this study was not designed for efficacy,
and a selection of patients with more favorable characteristics is always possible in this type of trial, our exploratory
outcome analysis is encouraging. Overall, median survival
time was 24 months, 27.2 months for patients on whom
we operated. This compares to 15.7 to 30 months in
larger series,3,28-31 and mirrors the data of concomitant
gemcitabine-radiochemotherapy trials reporting median
survival times of 13,19,22,32 17,23,25,26 20,20 21,16,21 and
25 months.18,24 Of note, 60% of our patients were able to
undergo additional tumor resection, including almost
50% of those with stage IIIB disease. Exploratory analysis
suggests that they may have benefited from improved
locoregional tumor control and survival. This correlates
well with previous publications.3,31
Despite acceptable local cancer control, aggressive
locoregional treatment does not prevent distant meta-

4838

stasis. More effective systemic treatments are therefore
needed. Our findings suggest that gemcitabine doses close
to those used for systemic treatment of metastatic
disease33 can be given concomitantly with radiation and
cisplatin. But the overall impact of this dose awaits further
clarification. Ten of our patients developed brain metastases. Early brain screening, therefore, is necessary before
advising aggressive local treatment. Furthermore, a
prophylactic brain irradiation for patients with NSCLC
should be reassessed.34,35
Several aspects of our multimodal approach may
deserve emphasis: 1) we directed the radiation to lung
segments scheduled for resection to decrease radiation
exposure to lung tissue remaining after surgery; 2) retaining on aggressive use of radiation/cisplatin, we gradually
increased gemcitabine to intensify overall therapy; and 3)
we scheduled gemcitabine for weekends to bridge the
regular treatment gaps of radiotherapy; consequently, we
could not take advantage of its radiosensitizing properties.
We conclude that aggressive treatment with radiation/cisplatin and concomitant gemcitabine can be given
to patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Radical resection thereafter is feasible. The impact of increased overall
treatment intensity on metastasis and survival warrants
further evaluation.
