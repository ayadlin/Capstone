ABSTRACT
There are few effective treatments for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
We present a patient with recurrent GBM who achieved a prolonged response to
treatment with afatinib, an irreversible ErbB family blocker, plus temozolomide. A
58-year-old female patient was diagnosed with multifocal primary GBM. After surgical
resection, first-line therapy comprised radiotherapy and temozolomide. Following
disease progression after 3 temozolomide cycles, the patient entered a phase I/II
clinical trial of afatinib (20–40 mg daily for 28 days) plus temozolomide (50 mg/m2
every 21/28 days). Next-generation sequencing analysis of the brain tumor specimen
was performed. At the last assessment, 63 treatment cycles had been completed and
the patient had survived for ~5 years since recurrence. Significant disease regression
was observed after 5 cycles and was maintained during long-term follow-up. Adverse
events were consistent with the known tolerability profile of afatinib and were
managed by treatment interruption/dose reduction. The patient had several epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) aberrations, including gene amplification and EGFRvIII
positivity. Three somatic mutations were identified, including an unprecedented
extracellular-domain substitution (D247Y). The patient has survived ~6-fold longer
than normally expected in patients with recurrent GBM. The complex EGFR genotype
may underlie sustained response to afatinib plus temozolomide.

As GBM is highly heterogeneous, optimal
treatment tailored to the individual is difficult [5].
Nevertheless, several potential prognostic factors of
survival have been identified and include the patient’s
age, and performance status, tumor location, and extent
of surgical resection [7]. Furthermore, developments in
genomic technology have facilitated the identification of
molecular markers that could potentially drive treatment
decisions. For example, methylation status of the gene
encoding O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT) predicts response to temozolomide-based
regimens in elderly patients [8]. Molecular studies have
also identified markers that provide insights into the

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent,
highly malignant primary tumor of the central nervous
system [1], accounting for approximately 12–15% of all brain
tumors [2]. The current standard of care is temozolomide plus
radiotherapy [3]. However, almost all GBMs recur after firstline therapy and few second-line options have been identified
that provide sustained clinical benefit [4]. Consequently, most
patients die soon after tumor recurrence; median overall
survival after disease progression is approximately 6–9
months [4, 5]. However, a small proportion of patients can
survive for considerably longer [6].

pathogenesis of GBM and potentially identify rationale for
drug targets. For example, heritable genetic aberrations of
the ErbB family of receptors, particularly the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), has been implicated in
GBM progression [9]. Overexpression of EGFR has been
identified in 50–60% of GBM cases and is generally
thought to confer poor prognosis [10–12], particularly in
the presence of the EGFRvIII mutation [13].
To date, clinical trials with targeted agents in
patients with GBM have been disappointing. For example,
bevacizumab and cilengitide have been investigated in a
first-line treatment setting, but these studies failed to show
improvements in survival [14–16]. Furthermore, despite
the likely role of EGFR in the pathogenesis of disease,
reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and
erlotinib) do not appear to be effective for recurrent GBM
[17–19]. Recently, a phase I/II study assessed afatinib, a
potent irreversible ErbB family blocker, with or without
protracted temozolomide, in patients with recurrent GBM
[20]. The rationale for this study was the observation
that afatinib inhibits proliferation of cells with EGFR
mutations that are commonly found in GBM, including
EGFRvIII and R108K [21, 22]. Furthermore, unlike
erlotinib and gefitinib, cytochrome P450 metabolism of
afatinib is negligible [23], thus facilitating combination
with chemotherapy or some anti-epileptic drugs. Also,
clinical studies have shown afatinib to be effective in
several tumor types, notably non-small cell lung cancer
including patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib
or erlotinib [24–28]. Unfortunately, the phase I/II study
demonstrated that afatinib monotherapy, and afatinib plus
temozolomide, had limited activity in unselected patients
with recurrent GBM. However, certain selected patient
populations (including patients with high levels of EGFR
vIII immunoreactivity, EGFR amplification, or PTEN

loss) appeared to have promising response and durable
progression-free survival.
Here, we present a patient with multifocal recurrent
GBM who demonstrated a remarkable response to
treatment with afatinib plus temozolomide. We undertook
broad molecular analysis on this patient’s tumor to assess
possible mechanistic explanations for the sustained
clinical benefit that was observed. Informed consent has
been obtained.

CASE PRESENTATION
This right-handed, 58-year-old, previously healthy
female patient presented in October 2009 with constant
right frontal headache, mild weakness of the left side, gait
disturbance, and behavioral changes (anger, forgetfulness).

Radiological analysis
Three lesions were identified from radiological
assessment (Figure 1). These included a right frontal lesion
(4.0 × 3.7 × 4.9 cm) with surrounding edema and mass effect
on the adjacent right frontal horn (9 mm to the left of midline);
a subcortical left basal frontal area lesion (maximum diameter
1.3 cm) with thick marginal enhancement and central cystic/
necrotic appearance, and a left inferior frontal gyrus lesion
evident in T2 and Flair images.

Surgical resection
Subtotal resection of the right frontal lesion was
performed in October 2009. Postoperative reduction in
tumor size was evident upon radiological assessment
(Figure 1). The patient was diagnosed with multifocal
glioma and pathological findings were consistent with

Adverse events

GBM World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV.
Tumor MGMT promoter and isocitrate dehydrogenase
1 (IDH1) status were determined to be methylated and
wild-type, respectively. Two weeks following surgery,
the patient developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in
the right lower extremity and a pulmonary embolism.
Consequently, the patient was treated with heparin
followed by low molecular weight heparin. Within
10 days, she had fully recovered from the DVT.

In total, the patient experienced four incidences
of grade III adverse events that were considered to be
at least probably related to second-line treatment: one
incidence of maculopapular rash and three incidences of
paronychia. The maculopapular rash occurred during the
third cycle and was managed with a 2-week interruption
of treatment followed by a dose reduction (afatinib from
40 to 30 mg p.o. daily; temozolomide from 140 to 90 mg
p.o. daily). Grade III paronychia occurred during cycle
16, cycle 20 (leading to a dose reduction of afatinib
from 30 to 20 mg p.o. daily), and cycle 36 (leading to a
treatment interruption of 7 weeks). Dose reductions led
to marked improvement in symptoms.
Other drug-related adverse events included grade I
nausea and vomiting (cycle 1; managed with anti-emetics),
grade II diarrhea (cycle 1; managed with loperamide),
grade I rash (cycles 1 and 2; managed with hydrocortisone
cream), weight loss, and fatigue.
The patient’s neurologic and physical status were
stable (Karnofsky Performance Status > 90) throughout
second-line treatment.

Treatments administered
First-line treatment, initiated in November 2009,
comprised the STUPP protocol: radiotherapy (60 Gy
over 6 weeks; intensity modulated radiotherapy [IMRT])
with concurrent oral temozolomide (75 mg/m2 daily
for 42 days), followed by adjuvant temozolomide
150–200 mg/m2 every 5/28 days [29]. The patient
tolerated the concurrent treatment well. However, in
February 2010, disease progression was observed by
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 3 cycles of
adjuvant temozolomide (increase in left frontal lesion
with mass effect; Figure 1).
Second-line treatment, initiated in April 2010, was
determined according to participation in a clinical trial of
afatinib with or without daily temozolomide. The patient
was randomized to the combined afatinib (20–40 mg
daily for 28 days) and temozolomide (50 mg/m2 orally
[p.o.] every 21/28 days) arm. After 1 cycle of second-line
treatment, MRI revealed minimal decrease in lesion size.
After 5 cycles, significant disease regression was observed
and maintained in subsequent assessments to 54 months
(Figure 2). A full spine MRI performed in November 2014
showed no evidence of metastases in the cervical, thoracic
or lumbar regions and the most recent MRI (January 2015)
showed stable disease. At the time of writing (April 2015),
the patient had completed 63 cycles and treatment was
ongoing.

Molecular analysis
DNA was isolated from a brain tumor specimen from
the primary resection and subjected to FoundationOne™
next-generation sequencing [30]. The entire coding
sequence of 236 cancer-related genes, plus 47 introns
from 19 genes often rearranged or altered in cancer, was
assessed. Fifteen cancer-related gene alterations were
evident.
A number of EGFR aberrations were observed
(Table 1). The patient was positive for EGFR amplification
(estimated copy number of 60) and was likely positive for
the EGFRvIII mutation (the extent of the EGFRvIII variant
is difficult to quantify with next-generation sequencing).

patient. In independent analysis, the MGMT promoter was
found to be methylated.

It is not unusual to observe amplification of both wildtype EGFR and EGFRvIII in the same tumor; EGFRvIII is
rarely observed in isolation [31]. Two subclonal somatic
mutations were observed (2% of reads), P596L and
G598V. Both of these mutations have previously been
identified in patients with GBM [21]. Interestingly, an
additional unprecedented variant of unknown significance
was observed in the extracellular domain of EGFR
(D247Y; 89% of reads). This could potentially be a rare
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), but could also be
a somatically acquired allele that may possibly be linked
to the observed clinical response to afatinib.
Other genetic aberrations of interest included a null
mutation in PTEN and deletion of CDKN2A and B, all of
which are common genetic features of GBM. A number of
other genes were found to have single base-pair changes,
including BAP1, BCORL1, C170rf39, CDH1, EPHA5,
ESR1, GRIN2A, and MAP3K1. It is likely that all of these
aberrations represent rare heterozygous SNPs without
any functional relevance (Table 1). Of note, several other
common molecular genetic features of GBM, such as
mutations in TP53, NF1, and IDH1, were absent in this

AFATINIB IN MOUSE XENOGRAFT
MODELS OF GBM
The anti-tumor activity of afatinib has been
evaluated in two different glioblastoma models derived
from adult patients. These experiments were performed
before trial initiation with the aim of illustrating that
afatinib could have single-agent activity in glioblastoma
models. Of note, both models have some degree of genetic
similarity with the tumor profile of the patient described
in this report (likely positive for EGFRvIII mutation
and positive for EGFR amplification). The GB218
glioblastoma model is characterized by the presence of
EGFRvIII mutation. In this model, monotherapy treatment
(44 days) with afatinib (10, 7.5 or 5mg/kg/day) or erlotinib
(50mg/kg/day) resulted in tumor growth inhibition (TGI)
of 60.0, 69.3, 46.9, and 52.2%, respectively (Figure 3A).
These doses are below the usual maximum tolerated doses

in mice. GB218 also displayed sensitivity to temozolomide
(50 or 25 mg/kg/day) resulting in complete suppression of
tumor growth (TGI = 103.4%). The GB138 glioblastoma
model is characterized by EGFR gene copy number
gain (EGFR amplification). In this model, monotherapy
treatment (28 days) with afatinib (10 or 7.5 mg/kg/day) or
erlotinib (40mg/kg/day) resulted in TGI of 91.5, 81.8 and
72.7%, respectively (Figure 3B). Temozolomide (25 mg/
kg/5 days on - 2 days off) resulted in complete suppression
of tumor growth (TGI = 110.5%).

(n = 39). Nevertheless, subanalysis suggested that
patients with certain molecular characteristics may
benefit from combination therapy versus temozolomide
monotherapy. For example, median progression-free
survival was 2.7 versus 1.0 months in patients with
EGFR amplification, and 2.7 versus 1.9 months in
patients with PTEN loss. The present patient exhibited
characteristics associated with a stronger afatinib
response: EGFR amplification, EGFRvIII positivity,
and a null mutation in PTEN. Our preclinical data in
mouse xenograft models demonstrate that tumors with
these EGFR aberrations are sensitive to tyrosine kinase
inhibitors.
We have undertaken broad molecular analysis of
the patient to try to more clearly define the molecular
aberrations that could potentially identify patients who
might achieve significant clinical benefit from afatinib
plus temozolomide. The patient’s overall molecular
pathology was largely consistent with the ‘classical
GBM’ subtype proposed by Verhaak, et al. [32], which
is characterized by EGFR amplification and a lack of
abnormalities in TP53, NF1, PDGFRα, and IDH1. It
is possible that EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII
positivity could underlie the encouraging response to
afatinib plus temozolomide. However, 3 additional
EGFR aberrations were also identified. Two of these
aberrations, P596L and G598V, were clonally rare
within the tumor and are therefore unlikely candidates
for driving response to combination therapy. However,
the third aberration, D247Y, appeared to be clonally
amplified in the tumor and could therefore conceivably
contribute to the observed response to afatinib plus
temozolomide. Interestingly, this aberration affects
the extracellular domain of EGFR. A previous study
has shown that variants in the extracellular domain are

DISCUSSION
This case report describes a sustained clinical
and radiographic response in a patient with recurrent
multifocal GBM. Since progression on first-line
therapy, the patient has survived for 60 months,
approximately 6 times longer than the median overall
survival generally observed in patients with recurrent
GBM. It is not possible to say with certainty that
these striking observations are solely attributable to
treatment with afatinib and temozolomide. Moreover,
pseudo-progression cannot be definitively excluded
because the tumor is MGMT-methylated and disease
progression was observed only 4 months after
chemoradiation treatment.
This patient was participating in a clinical trial
of afatinib with or without temozolomide for recurrent
GBM (NCT00727506) [20]. The main finding of this
study was that afatinib has limited effect on survival
in unselected patients. Overall, median progressionfree survival in patients treated with afatinib plus
temozolomide (n = 39) was 1.5 months versus
1.9 months in patients treated with temozolomide only

relatively common in patients with GBM (13.6%) and
confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
[21]. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that
the complex EGFR genotype comprising extracellular
aberrations in concert with focal amplification and the
EGFRvIII mutation may underlie the observed sensitivity
to afatinib and temozolomide. This hypothesis may be
tested further in a suitable in vitro model. Moreover, it
would be interesting to assess patients who have been
treated with the combination in the phase I/II trial for
EGFR extracellular aberrations. It is important to note
that the tumor specimen sequenced was from initial
resection, prior to any treatment; as such, the profile may
have evolved upon exposure to subsequent therapies,
but we cannot speculate on the nature of any treatmentdriven evolution.
Adverse events in this case were manageable and
in line with previous studies of the safety profiles of
afatinib and temozolomide, including the GBM trial [20,
24, 26, 33]. In relation to safety, the GBM study also
reported a lack of pharmacokinetic interactions between
afatinib and temozolomide [20], supporting a strategy of
co-administration of these drugs.
In conclusion, we describe a novel extracellular
EGFR mutation in a recurrent GBM patient who
demonstrated uncharacteristically prolonged survival
following afatinib plus daily temozolomide. Studies to
confirm the criteria for predicting afatinib response, and
to determine the optimal dosing regimen, are awaited
with interest.
