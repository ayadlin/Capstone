ABSTRACT:
Myelosuppression and gastrointestinal damage are common side effects of
cancer treatment limiting efficacy of DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs. The
Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) agonist Entolimod has demonstrated efficacy in mitigating
damage to hematopoietic and gastrointestinal tissues caused by radiation. Here, using
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) treated mice as a model of chemotherapy-induced side effects,
we demonstrated significant reduction in the severity of 5-FU-induced morbidity and
increased survival accompanied by the improved integrity of intestinal tissue and
stimulated the restoration of hematopoiesis. Entolimod-stimulated IL-6 production
was essential for Entolimod’s ability to rescue mice from death caused by doses
of 5-FU associated with hematopoietic failure. In contrast, IL-6 induction was not
necessary for protection and restoration of drug-damaged gastrointestinal tissue
by Entolimod. In a syngeneic mouse CT26 colon adenocarcinoma model, Entolimod
reduced the systemic toxicity of 5-FU, but did not reduce its antitumor efficacy
indicating that the protective effect of Entolimod was selective for normal, nontumor, tissues. These results suggest that Entolimod has clinical potential to broaden
the therapeutic window of genotoxic anticancer drugs by reducing their associated
hematopoietic and gastrointestinal toxicities.

INTRODUCTION

of Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and has demonstrated
tissue protective effects against multiple types of insults.
Entolimod treatment rescued lethally irradiated mice and
non-human primates from HP, GI and cutaneous acute
radiation syndromes by preventing radiation-induced
loss of HP stem cells and early progenitors in the bone
marrow, rescuing proliferating stem cells in crypts of the
small intestine, and reducing the severity of dermatitis
and mucositis [7, 8]. Entolimod also demonstrated tissue
protective efficacy in mouse models of renal ischemiareperfusion injury [9] and Fas-mediated hepatotoxicity
[10], indicating that its protective effects are not restricted
to radiation-induced damage. Importantly, Entolimod
does not protect tumors from radiation therapy, but rather

Severe adverse side effects continue to be a major
challenge of use of many conventional anticancer drugs.
These include gastrointestinal (GI) damage with such
symptoms as diarrhea, vomiting, GI mucositis and body
weight loss, and hematopoietic (HP) damage causing
leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, myelosuppression leading
to immunosuppression and uncontrolled bacteremia [14]. These toxicities frequently prevent administration of
sufficiently effective drug doses and can severely affect
quality of life or even be fatal [4-6].

derivative of bacterial flagellin that functions as an agonist

suppresses tumor growth through stimulation of antitumor
immune responses [8, 10-12]. TLR5 agonistic agents like
Entolimod have a notable advantage over other TLR
agonists that have been considered for clinical use (TLR3,
4 and 7 [13]) in that the specific profile of cytokines
induced following TLR5 stimulation does not include
those that can lead to a harmful uncontrolled “cytokine
storm”, such as IL-1 and TNF [13, 14].
Entolimod’s mechanism of action involves TLR5dependent NF-B- (and STAT3-) mediated induction of
multiple factors that suppress apoptosis, scavenge reactive
oxygen species (ROS), and induce tissue regeneration.
Given the similarity in toxicities induced in normal
GI and HP tissues by radiation and DNA-damaging
chemotherapeutic drugs and the potent efficacy of these
Entolimod-induced mechanisms in reducing radiation
damage, we expected that Entolimod might demonstrate
similar protective effects in the context of genotoxic
chemotherapy. Therefore, in this study, we focused on
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), a DNA-damaging anticancer
drug commonly used alone or in combination with other
chemotherapeutics for treatment of a number of different
types of cancer including colon, stomach, head and neck,
breast, etc. [15-21]. High-dose continuous treatment with
5-FU causes DNA damage in proliferating cells through
inhibition of thymidylate synthase, a key component of
DNA synthesis and repair pathways. In addition to tumors,
HP and GI cells demonstrate 5-FU sensitivity [22, 23].
Hematological toxicity of 5-FU involves p53-mediated

induction of ribosomal stress, which blocks translation
[24, 25]. In addition, 5-FU stimulates inflammatory
responses that cause additional damage through
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and secretion
of IL-1 and TNF [3] which may be mediators of a p53independent mechanism of 5-FU toxicity in the small and
large intestine [22]. Inhibition of IL-1 activity in small
intestinal tissue was shown to prevent 5-FU-induced GI
injury [26]. IL-6 is another cytokine found to be associated
with toxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs [3]; however,
it has also been reported to protect intestinal tissues from
toxic doses of 5-FU [27].
In this study, we demonstrated significant
protective effects of Entolimod on the toxicity of 5-FU
in two mouse strains, BALB/c and C57BL/6. IL-6 was
defined as an essential component of the mechanism by
which Entolimod protects mice against an HP but not GI
damage. Importantly, the protective effect of Entolimod
against 5-FU toxicity was selective to normal tissues as
demonstrated in the mouse model of colon cancer.

RESULTS
Effect of Entolimod on 5-FU-induced mortality in
mice
To determine whether Entolimod is capable of
protecting normal tissues from the toxicity of 5-FU, we

used two mouse strains, BALB/c and C57BL/6, which
differ in their sensitivity to 5-FU. Mice were administered
5-FU alone or in combination with subsequent Entolimod
treatment using different doses and schedules. Toxicity
was assessed by monitoring body weight loss and
mortality.
In BALB/c mice, we found that injection of 100 mg/
kg 5-FU induced only transient body weight loss without
mortality, but that a single injection of 200 mg/kg 5-FU
caused severe weight loss and 80-100% mortality within
2 weeks after 5-FU injection (Fig. 1A and B). The kinetics
of body weight loss showed an initial drop in mean body
weight during the first 3-5 days after injection, partial
improvement by day 7-8, and then a second drop with no
recovery. A higher dose of 5-FU (400 mg/kg) caused more
rapid single-phasic body weight loss and death of 100%
of animals within 7 days. At both tested doses of 5-FU,
administration of Entolimod (two s.c. injections given 24

and 48 h after 5-FU) significantly reduced body weight
loss and prevented mouse mortality. With 200 mg/kg
5-FU + Entolimod, mean body weight loss was minimal
(<10%) and all mice survived to the end of the 30 day
observation period. With 400 mg/kg 5-FU + Entolimod,
the initial 5-FU-induced drop in mean body weight was
observed, but this was reversed at Day 5, and on Day
30, mean body weight was restored to normal and 80%
of animals were alive. Improved resistance of BALB/c
mice to 5-FU-induced toxicity was also observed when
Entolimod was applied 24 h (single injection), or 1, 48 and
96 h (three injections) after 200 mg/kg 5-FU as evidenced
by substantially reduced weight loss and an increase in
30-day survival to 90% (versus 0% in the group given
5-FU alone) (Supplementary Fig. S1). Under the same
conditions, two injections of Entolimod given 1 h and 24
h post-5FU prevented weight loss and mortality in only
3/10 mice, a statistically non-significant benefit.

mg/kg (B) followed by three s.c. Entolimod (1 µg/mouse) injections 1, 48 and 96 h post-5-FU. Mean concentrations (K/µl peripheral blood)

C57BL/6 mice were more resistant to 5-FU toxicity
than BALB/c mice. Administration of 200 mg/kg 5-FU
to C57BL/6 mice was not lethal, but caused transient
body weight loss (only about 10-15%) with complete
recovery by Day 10 (data not shown). However, 400 mg/
kg 5-FU, which caused early death of BALB/c mice by
day 7, was lethal for majority of C57BL/6 mice by day
15 (Fig. 1C). Toxicity with similar kinetics was observed
after three injections of 100 mg/kg 5-FU given 24 h apart,
with severe weight loss and death occurring about 2 weeks
post-treatment (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Fig. S2A-B).
With both toxic regimens of 5-FU treatment, injection of
Entolimod (1 µg/mouse) 24 and 48 h after injection of the
last fraction of 5-FU resulted in significant reduction of
body weight loss and improved survival. With addition of
Entolimod to 400 mg/kg 5-FU treatment, 30-day survival
was increased from 10% to 70% (p=0.0079, Fig. 1C).
Similarly, when Entolimod was given to mice treated with
3x100 mg/kg 5-FU, mortality was significantly delayed.
Mean survival time was increased from 11.5 days to 14
days (p= 0.0002) and 30-day survival was increased from
0% to 30%. The ability of Entolimod to reduce 5-FUassociated mortality was confirmed to be TLR5-specific
since the effect was not observed in similarly treated
TLR5 knockout mice (Supplementary Fig. S2C).

induced HP damage, we next evaluated whether Entolimod
specifically reduces HP damage caused by 5-FU. As shown
in Figure 2, treatment of BALB/c mice with 200 or 100
mg/kg 5-FU resulted in rapid elimination of practically all
types of blood cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes
and platelets, correlating with lethality observed within
11-14 days after 5-FU administration. Entolimod treatment
after 200 mg/kg 5-FU did not significantly ameliorate
5-FU-induced depletion of blood cell populations as
observed on Days 7 and 11 post-5-FU (Fig. 2A). However,
in contrast to mice treated with 200 mg/kg 5-FU alone,
mice treated with Entolimod after 200 mg/kg 5-FU
administration showed gradual recovery of hematopoiesis
leading to complete restoration of normal WBC and
neutrophil levels by Day 14 and improved mouse survival.
With sub-lethal doses of 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg 5-FU
(Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S3, respectively), mice
treated with Entolimod after 5-FU consistently displayed
more rapid recovery of peripheral blood cell populations
than mice given 5-FU alone. In some cases in response to
5-FU with or without Entolimod, surviving mice displayed
temporary overcompensation for the loss of HP cells:
numbers of lymphocytes, neutrophils and platelets were
higher in treated mice than in intact controls at the day 1415 time-points (Fig. 2B), but normalized by day 21 (data
not shown).
The effect of Entolimod treatment on 5-FU-induced
HP damage in BALB/c mice was also assessed through
morphological analysis of H&E-stained bone marrow
(BM) sections (Fig. 3). This showed that application
of 200 mg/kg 5-FU resulted in severe aplasia of the
BM, with near-complete absence of HP cells, remnants
of stromal cells, expanded sinusoids and hemorrhage

by Entolimod and is known to involve HP damage and

observed in BM sections prepared on Day 3 (72 h) after
5-FU administration. Treatment with Entolimod (1 µg/
mouse) 24 and 48 h after 200 mg/kg 5-FU had no or very
little beneficial effect on BM morphology at this time
point. In both 5-FU-treated mice and those given 5-FU
in combination with Entolimod, the BM was drastically
depopulated in contrast to BM samples from mice treated

with Entolimod alone or intact mice which displayed
normal morphology with a meshwork of bony spicules,
open areas with active hematopoiesis and sinusoids filled
with erythrocytes.
At Day 7, the BM of mice treated with 200 mg/kg
5-FU alone contained only single HP and stromal cells that
were rounded and detached from each other (indicative

of necrosis and necrobiosis). In addition, hemorrhage
and an abundant fat component were observed in these
BM samples. In contrast, the BM of mice injected with
Entolimod after 200 mg/kg 5-FU showed signs of HP
recovery including islets of preserved HP cells with
prevalent hyperplastic megakaryocytes suggesting that
Entolimod promotes recovery of hematopoiesis in the

BM and restoration of peripheral HP cell populations after
5-FU-induced damage.
Taken together, these data demonstrate that 5-FU
causes severe myelosuppression, neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia which likely contribute to the lethality
of the treatment in BALB/c mice. Furthermore, Entolimod
promotes recovery of hematopoiesis in the BM and

Previous studies in mice have shown that 5-FU
can induce GI damage in the small and large intestines,
causing diarrhea and body weight loss leading to
mortality [26, 28, 29]. To assess the effect of Entolimod
treatment on the GI toxicity of 5-FU, we compared tissue
morphology in H&E-stained transverse sections of small
and large intestines from untreated “intact” mice and
mice treated with different regimens of 5-FU with or
without Entolimod. Specific morphological features were
evaluated, including (a) the height and width of villi of

(Fig. 4). 5-FU-induced injury was most pronounced in the
crypt layer, with smaller and more dense crypts, scarce
and degranulated Paneth’s cells, abnormal differentiation
and maturation of the crypt epithelium, absence of goblet
cells, and enlarged and vesicular nuclei. As expected, the
observed toxicity was dose- and time-dependent, with
greater damage observed after treatment with 400 mg/kg
5-FU versus 200 mg/kg 5-FU and at day 3 versus day 7
indicating GI recovery at the latter time point. However,
after 400 mg/kg 5-FU, crypt damage remained significant
even at day 7. In addition to the above described changes

in the crypts, severe 5-FU-induced injury was seen in
the surface epithelium of the villi, in the lamina propria
and in the submucosa. For both tested 5-FU doses,
Entolimod injection at 24 and 48 h post-5-FU led to
significant mitigation of 5-FU-induced damage to the
small intestine mucosa and morphology closer to normal
(Fig. 4A-C). The most dramatic evidence of this was the
preservation of secretory Paneth’s cells in the crypts of
all mice treated with Entolimod in addition to 5-FU. The
beneficial effect of Entolimod was clearly illustrated by
the near-complete restoration of normal small intestine
morphology on day 7 after 5-FU injection in Entolimodtreated mice, while those given 5-FU alone showed severe
damage with no signs of recovery at the same time point.
In addition, the average overall GI injury scores obtained
by semi-quantitative scoring of the stained tissue sections
confirmed efficacy of Entolimod in reducing small
intestine toxicity of 200 or 400 mg/kg doses of 5-FU at
both day 3 and day 7 (Fig. 4C).
Similar analysis of the morphology of the large
intestine (colon) in BALB/c mice after 200 mg/kg or 400
mg/kg 5-FU treatment showed dose-dependent injury
of the colonic mucosa on day 3 and 7 post-5-FU, with
atrophic and degenerative changes observed mainly in the
crypt cells (e.g., loss of mucin globules, loss of distinct
boundaries between adjacent cells, disappearance of the
apical cytoplasm, and extended crypt lumens) (Fig. 5).
Treatment of 5-FU-injected mice with Entolimod led to
improved preservation of crypt cells and mucin globules
and overall closer-to-normal morphology in the large
intestine. The beneficial effect of Entolimod on 5-FUinduced large intestine injury at day 3 and day 7 post5-FU was found to be statistically significant for groups
treated with high dose (400 mg/kg) 5-FU (Fig. 5C).
The GI toxicity of 5-FU and potential mitigative effect
of Entolimod were examined further by determining
the number of mitoses per crypt (“mitotic index”) in
transverse small intestine sections as an indicator of the
proliferative capacity/health of the crypts (Fig. 4D). 5-FU
administration (200 or 400 mg/kg) was found to cause a
dose-dependent reduction in mitotic index on day 3 postinjection. At both 5-FU dose levels, Entolimod treatment
ameliorated the drop in mitotic index on day 3 (although
only significantly so with 400 mg/kg 5-FU). By day 7
after 200 mg/kg 5-FU injection, the mitotic index was
restored to normal in both mice treated with 5-FU alone
and those treated with 5-FU+Entolimod; however, on day
7 after 400 mg/kg 5-FU injection, efficacy of Entolimod in
promoting restoration of the small intestine mitotic index
was evident. The mitotic index on day 7 in mice treated
with Entolimod after 400 mg/kg 5-FU was the same as
in intact mice, while that in mice treated with 5-FU alone
remained ~50% lower than normal (Fig. 4D).
Taken together, the results of these direct analyses
of the GI tract demonstrate that Entolimod counteracts the
GI toxicity of 5-FU, primarily by stimulating regeneration

of damaged GI tissue.

5-FU toxicity can be mediated by the development
of inflammation following from induction of proinflammatory cytokines and ROS formation in GI
tissues. In particular, IL-1 has been identified as an
essential mediator of 5-FU GI toxicity [26]. Natural
mechanisms by which IL-1 activity can be suppressed
include increased production of soluble IL-1 receptor
and/or IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN) proteins [34].
Notably, IL-1RN expression was previously shown to
be induced in the colon of flagellin-treated mice and to
contribute to the amelioration of colitis in the treated
mice [14]. Here, we found that the plasma concentration
of soluble IL-1 receptor was significantly elevated in
mice treated with Entolimod alone or following 5-FU as
compared to untreated “intact” mice (Supplementary Fig.
S6A). In addition, upregulation of IL-1RN expression
in the small intestine was detected following Entolimod
treatment of mice (Supplementary Fig. S6B). These
data suggest neutralization of IL-1 activity as a possible
mechanism underlying Entolimod-mediated mitigation of
5-FU toxicity in GI tissues. Additionally, our finding that
production of the antioxidant enzyme SOD2 in the small
intestine was increased following Entolimod treatment of
mice presents neutralization of ROS as another possible
mechanism involved in the protective effects of Entolimod
against 5-FU-induced tissue damage (Supplementary Fig.
S6C, [35]).

Role of IL-6 in the protective effects of Entolimod
against 5-FU toxicity
The NF-B-regulated cytokine IL-6 is strongly
upregulated in response to Entolimod treatment [30].
IL-6 is a candidate mediator of the tissue protective
effects of Entolimod since it is known to have protective
and hematopoiesis stimulating properties (particularly
for the thrombocytic lineage) [30-33]. Induction of IL-6
by Entolimod was previously shown to be critical for
mitigation of HP acute radiation syndrome and prevention
of death in mice after total body irradiation [30]. Here,
we found that Entolimod injection also causes induction
of IL-6 in 5-FU-treated mice. A strong Entolimoddependent spike in plasma levels of IL-6 (58-fold over the
level observed with vehicle treatment) was observed in
BALB/c mice at 7 days after 200 mg/kg 3-FU treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S4). In order to determine whether
Entolimod-induced IL-6 plays a role in the drug’s ability
to protect mice against 5-FU toxicity, we compared the
effects of Entolimod treatment on 5-FU-associated body
weight loss, mortality and morphological GI damage
in IL-6-KO mice versus wild type (WT) BALB/c mice.
IL-6-KO and WT mice displayed similar sensitivity to 3
different does of 5-FU as determined by body weight loss
and survival (100, 150 and 200 mg/kg) (data not shown).
However, while Entolimod was able to rescue WT mice
from death induced by 200 mg/kg 5-FU, it did not reduce
the lethality of the same dose of 5-FU in IL-6-KO mice
(Fig. 6A). In contrast, with a higher dose of 5-FU (400
mg/kg), Entolimod treatment did provide some survival
benefit to IL-6-KO mice, increasing mean survival time
from 8 to 10 days (P<0.001) (Fig. 6C). This improvement
in survival of IL-6-KO mice dosed with 400 mg/kg 5-FU
was associated with Entolimod-mediated recovery of body
weight after initial 5-FU-induced weight loss (Fig. 6B),
consistent with mitigation of GI damage in KO animals
with preservation of crypt cells in small intestine and
higher mitotic index (Fig. 6D and Supplementary Fig.
S5) as in WT animals (Fig. 4B and D). Entolimod did
not, however, prevent mouse lethality and all KO mice
treated with 400 mg/kg 5-FU + Entolimod died by day
13 post-5-FU (Fig. 6C). Using a sub-lethal dose of 5-FU
(100 mg/kg), we confirmed that Entolimod-mediated
acceleration of HP recovery was absent in IL-6-KO mice
(Fig. 6E) in contrast to WT mice (Fig. 2B). Together with
the knowledge that in BALB/c mice 200 and 400 mg/
kg doses of 5-FU induce primarily HP and GI damage,
respectively, these data demonstrate that IL-6 production is
an essential mechanism of Entolimod-mediated restoration
of hematopoiesis after 5-FU treatment, but is not required
for mitigation of GI toxicity under the same conditions.
In addition to its direct cytotoxic effects,

Entolimod does not protect tumors from 5-FU
Clearly, use of Entolimod to improve anticancer
chemotherapy by reducing its adverse side effects requires
that the protective effects of the drug are strictly limited
to normal (non-tumor) cells and tissues. Since 5-FU is
commonly used as a single agent or in combination with
other chemotherapeutic drugs to treat colorectal cancer
[36, 37], we used the mouse CT26 colorectal carcinoma
model to test the effect of Entolimod on tumor sensitivity
to 5-FU. CT26 cells do not express TLR5 and their
growth as s.c. tumors is not suppressed by Entolimod
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7) [10]. CT26 tumors
were, however, sensitive to 5-FU treatment as expected,
showing 5-FU dose-dependent reduction of tumor growth
(Fig. 7A). Inclusion of Entolimod in the treatment regimen
with either 100 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg 5-FU did not have
any significant effect on 5-FU-induced tumor suppression
(Fig. 7A).
Entolimod treatment also did not significantly
change survival of tumor-bearing mice treated with
100 mg/kg 5-FU; 100% of mice in these two groups
were euthanized by Day 29 after tumor cell inoculation
due to tumors reaching the size endpoint or developing
ulcerations (Fig. 7B). In contrast, 100 % of mice injected
with 200 mg/kg 5-FU without Entolimod died due to
5-FU toxicity by Day 27 post tumor cell implantation
(Day 23 post 5-FU injection), while those treated with

the combination of 200 mg/kg 5-FU and Entolimod
experienced significantly less toxicity. Tumor-bearing
mice given Entolimod after 200 mg/kg 5-FU displayed
less weight loss (Fig. 7B) and significantly prolonged
survival (Fig. 7C) compared to those treated with 200
mg/kg 5-FU alone. Moreover, 2 of the 10 mice treated
with 200 mg/kg 5-FU+Entolimod survived tumor-free for
the entire period of observation (>60 days). These results
illustrate that treatment of CT26 tumor-bearing mice with
Entolimod in combination with 5-FU reduced the systemic
toxicity of 5-FU without affecting its antitumor efficacy.

that the protective/ regenerative effects of the drug
could potentially reduce the antitumor efficacy of the
chemotherapy. However, in numerous experiments with
multiple mouse tumor models (e.g., colon adenocarcinoma
CT26, breast 4T1, etc.), we have never observed any
stimulation of tumor growth or induction of tumor
recurrence by Entolimod treatment [7, 8, 10]. In the
current study, mice bearing syngeneic CT26 tumors were
protected from the systemic toxicity associated with 5-FU
treatment by injection of Entolimod, but Entolimod did
not reduce the tumor suppressive effect of 5-FU. The
difference between normal and tumor cell responses to
Entolimod is likely due to the fact that most tumor cells
commonly acquire impairment of pathways controlling
cell cycle and DNA repair (e.g., p53), frequently resulting
in constitutively active NF-B and STAT3 [38, 44, 45] thus
making TLR5 stimulation ineffective. In addition to its
failure to protect tumors from radiation and chemotherapy,
Entolimod actually demonstrates antitumor efficacy in
itself. This has been shown for subcutaneously growing
TLR5-positive tumors as well as tumors growing in
TLR5-positive tissues (e.g., liver) regardless of the TLR5
status of the tumor cells [8, 10]. The tumor suppressive
effects of Entolimod appear to be due to induction of
cytokines leading to development of antitumor immune
responses [11, 12]. Therefore, we have multiple reasons
to expect that Entolimod has strong potential to improve
the therapeutic index of anticancer chemotherapeutics by
mitigation of chemotherapy-induced adverse side effects
in hematopoietic and gastrointestinal tissues without
reducing tumor suppression.

DISCUSSION
Our previous work showing that the TLR5 agonist
Entolimod rescues mice and non-human primates
from lethal irradiation by protecting and stimulating
regeneration of HP and GI tissues [7] suggested that the
drug might have similar protective effects in the context
of genotoxic chemotherapy. Systemic administration
of Entolimod leads to NF-B- and STAT3-mediated
induction of numerous bioactive factors including antiapoptotic proteins, scavengers of ROS, cytokines and antiinflammatory agents which can contribute to protection of
normal tissues from the damaging effects of radiation- or
drug-related genotoxicity [10, 38]. For example, one of
the strongest responders to Entolimod treatment IL-6 is
known to have protective properties through activation of
the STAT3 signaling [31, 39-42].
Here, using 5-FU as a model, we show that
Entolimod is indeed capable of reducing the toxicity of
genotoxic chemotherapy to GI and HP tissues resulting
in overall improvement in health and survival of treated
mice. Entolimod did not prevent 5-FU-induced depletion
of HP cell populations, but did accelerate their recovery to
normal levels in an IL-6-dependent manner. This suggests
that Entolimod does not directly interfere with 5-FU HP
toxicity, but rather reduces the severity of damage and
stimulates tissue regeneration. In the GI tract, Entolimod
treatment both reduced the extent of 5-FU-induced damage
and promoted tissue recovery, but Entolimod-stimulated
IL-6 production was not responsible for these effects.
Elevated levels of the antioxidant enzyme SOD2 and
IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN) detected in the small
intestine and inhibitory soluble IL-1 receptor detected
in the plasma of Entolimod-treated mice suggest that
reduction of ROS activity and inhibition of IL-1-mediated
inflammation may contribute to the Entolimod’s ability to
reduce the GI toxicity of 5-FU [26]. The latter possibility
is consistent with previous work showing that induction of
IL-1RN in intestinal epithelia and macrophages following
flagellin-mediated TLR5 stimulation was important for
limiting inflammatory responses to Salmonella infection
and reducing inflammasome-associated colitis [14, 43].
A major potential concern with applying Entolimod
to reduce the toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs is

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
BALB/c and C57BL/6 female mice, 10-14 weeks
old (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used
in the study. IL-6 deficient mice C.129S2-IL6tm1/kopf/J
(BALB/c background) were originally purchased from
Jackson Laboratory; TLR5 knockout mice B6.129P2Tlr5tm1Aki (C57BL/6 background) were a generous gift of
Dr. Shizuo Akira (University of Tokyo, Japan); mice of
both strains were bred at Roswell Park Cancer Institute
(RPCI). All animal experiments followed protocols
approved by the RPCI IACUC.

Reagents
EntolimodTM , a TLR5 agonistic agent [7] was
obtained from Cleveland BioLabs, Inc. (Buffalo, NY).
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was purchased from Sigma (St.
Louis, MO).

(H&E) staining and analyzed in a blinded fashion
by a trained pathologist using ImagePro software
(at 10x magnification unless otherwise stated).
Pathomorphological changes in intestinal sections were
scored as: 4 – Severe; 3 – Markedly abnormal; 2 –
Moderate; 1 – Mild l; or 0 – Normal, with intermediate
non-integer scores assigned based on the pathologist’s
judgment. The mitotic index was determined by counting
the mitotic figures in crypt cells of the small intestine
using light microscopy at 100× magnification. The mitotic
index is calculated in longitudinally sectioned crypts as
an average value per crypt in each treatment-group (4
samples per mouse, 3 mice/group).

Murine colon undifferentiated carcinoma CT26 cells
(ATCC) were cultured in RPMI media with 10% FBS,
standard supplements (2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100mol/L
nonessential amino acids) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin
(Invitrogen) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.

In vivo model of 5-FU toxicity
Mice were weighed and randomly divided into
treatment groups. 5-FU was diluted in DMSO (40%) and
injected i.p. (100 or 200 mg/kg / 200 l/ injection). High
dose 5-FU (400 mg/kg) was given as two i.p. injections of
200 mg/kg 6 h apart. Entolimod (1 g/ 100 l) was injected
s.c. at the indicated times after the first 5-FU injection.
When mice were given three i.p. injections of 5-FU
(100 mg/kg/day, once/day), Entolimod (1 µg/mouse) was
injected 24 and 48 h after the last 5-FU injection. DMSO
(40%) and PBS were used as vehicle controls for 5-FU and
Entolimod, respectively. Mice were monitored daily or at
least 3 times a week for survival and signs of morbidity,
including changes in body weight.

Statistical analysis
Differences in body weight loss (expressed as
percent initial body weight) between groups were
analyzed by two-way (time and treatment) repeated
measures ANOVA; differences in histomorphological
scores of tissue damage and mitotic index were analyzed
by Student’s t-test (two-tailed, unequal variances);
differences in survival kinetics (mean survival time)
were analyzed by log-rank test using GraphPad Prism
software; differences in discrete blood cell populations
between treatment groups were determined using twotailed unpaired Student’s t-test. Significance level was set
at P <0.05.

In vivo model of 5-FU antitumor therapy
CT26 tumor cells (5x105 /100 µl PBS) were injected
s.c. into syngeneic BALB/c mice (2 flanks/mouse). When
tumors reached ~5 mm in diameter, mice were randomly
divided into 5 treatment groups. 5-FU (100 or 200 mg/kg)
was injected i.p. with Entolimod (1 µg/ 100 µl) or PBS
injected s.c. 1, 48 and 96 h after 5-FU. A group of mice
injected with vehicle solutions was used as an “untreated”
control. Tumors were measured by two diameters with a
digital caliper every second day. Tumor volume (V) was
calculated as: V= x d12 x d2, where d1< d2. Mice were
euthanized according to IACUC protocol when signs of
morbidity were observed or tumors reached about 13 mm
in diameter or developed ulceration.
