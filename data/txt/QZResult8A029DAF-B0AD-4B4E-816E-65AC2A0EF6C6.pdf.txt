ABSTRACT
The quest to develop novel antimitotic chemotherapy agents has led to the
generation of several small molecule inhibitors targeting Plk1, a protein kinase
required for multiple aspects of cell division. Previous studies have shown that upon
exposure to Plk1 inhibitors, cells enter mitosis, delay briefly in prophase and then
arrest in mitosis due to an inability to undergo centrosome separation. Here, we show
that four different classes of Plk1 inhibitor block mitotic entry in several cancer cell
lines and non-transformed RPE-1 cells. The proportion of cells that arrest in G2 is
cell line and concentration dependent, and is subject to non-genetic heterogeneity.
Following inhibitor washout, the G2 block is alleviated and cells enter mitosis but
then fail to complete cell division indicating that most Plk1 inhibitors are not fully
reversible. An exception is CYC140844; in contrast to five other inhibitors examined
here, this novel Plk1 inhibitor is fully reversible. We discuss the implications for
developing Plk1 inhibitors as chemotherapy agents and research tools.

into mitosis, centrosome maturation, bipolar spindle
formation, kinetochore-microtubule attachment, activation
of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome, resolution
of sister chromatid cohesion, and cytokinesis [12–17].
Plk1 is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors and
is often an indicator of poor patient prognosis [11, 18].
Consistent with a pro-tumorigenic role, overexpressing
Plk1 activates FoxM1, stimulating transcription of
several mitotic regulators favoring cell proliferation [19].
Moreover, constitutive expression of Plk1 transforms
NIH 3T3 fibroblasts [20], while inhibiting Plk1 induces
cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis [21, 22].
To explore Plk1’s potential as an anti-cancer
drug target, several small molecule inhibitors have
been developed and a number are undergoing clinical
evaluation [23–25]. However, while our understanding
of Plk1 biology is well advanced, the long-term
fate of cells exposed to Plk1 inhibitors is less clear.
Therefore, we set out to examine cell fate in response
to Plk1 inhibitors using a single-cell-based time-lapse
microscopy approach that previously revealed extensive
intra- and interline variation when cancer cells are
exposed to microtubule toxins [26].

INTRODUCTION
Antimitotic agents, including the taxanes, are used
extensively to treat breast and ovarian cancer as well as
various leukemias [1]. All clinically relevant antimitotic
agents inhibit microtubule dynamics, and while this has
potential to impact multiple aspects of tumor biology,
microtubule function is particularly important during
cell division when the mitotic spindle apparatus is
assembled [2, 3]. In cell culture and breast cancers,
disrupting spindle function causes mitotic failure, in
turn reducing proliferative potential [1, 4, 5]. However,
patient responses to antimitotic agents are unpredictable,
resistance is common, and toxicity in the form of
neuropathies can be problematic [6–8]. To address these
limitations, a plethora of second generation antimitotic
agents have been developed, including excellent
drugs targeting mitotic kinesins, such as Eg5/KSP and
Cenp-E, and mitotic kinases, such as Plk1, Aurora A and
Aurora B [9–11].
Plk1, a member of the polo-like kinase family,
regulates multiple cell cycle processes, including DNA
replication, recovery from G2 checkpoint arrest, entry

return to interphase without completing cell division [31].
Accordingly, while 25% of the BI 2536-treated DLD-1
cells arrested then died, 32% underwent slippage (Fig. 1D,
blue lines). As observed with HeLa, 30% of the DLD-1
cells failed to enter mitosis. The mitotic behavior of the
RPE-1 cells was similar to the cancer cells; 43% arrested
then died while 9% slipped, albeit after much longer
arrest periods (25.5 hours on average vs. 5.5 hours and
12.0 hours in HeLa and DLD-1 respectively). Once again
however, a substantial proportion, 47%, never entered
mitosis, remaining in interphase for the duration of the
experiment (Fig. 1D). Thus, as we showed previously with
taxol, nocodazole and the Eg5 inhibitor AZ138 [26], the
Plk1 inhibitor BI 2536 gives rise to intra- and interline
variation, with cells either undergoing death in mitosis or
slippage following a prolonged mitotic arrest. However, in
contrast to the aforementioned drugs, BI 2536 also blocks
mitotic entry in a substantial proportion of cells.

100 nM BI 2536 induces a penetrant polo
phenotype
When asynchronous populations of various cell
lines are exposed to Plk1 inhibitors, cells undergo mitotic
arrest exhibiting the prototypical “polo” phenotype that
arises when centrosomes fail to separate [27–30]. To
define the long-term fate of these cells, we first focused on
the pioneer Plk1 inhibitor, BI 2536 [27]. To determine the
minimal drug concentration required to induce a penetrant
polo phenotype, HeLa cells were exposed to increasing
concentrations of BI 2536 for two hours and spindle
morphology analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy
(Fig. 1A). At concentrations of 5 nM and below, cells
were capable of assembling bipolar, metaphase spindles.
However, at 10 nM and above, metaphase figures were
rare and polo spindles became increasingly prevalent. At
100 nM, more than 90% of mitotic cells were classified as
polo, so this concentration was chosen as a starting point
for further experiments.

When cells commit to mitosis in the presence of
BI 2536, entry is delayed
Previously, BI 2536 was shown to induce a brief
prophase delay [27]. We therefore asked whether cells
that did commit to mitosis experienced a delay by plotting
the cumulative mitotic entry frequency (Fig. 1E). Curves
derived from the control populations rose sharply and
plateaued just short of 100%, demonstrating that the
vast majority of cells entered mitosis within 12 hours.
Consistent with a substantial proportion of cells failing
to enter mitosis, the curves derived from drug-treated
populations plateaued well below 100%. However, the
curves were also substantially shallower, indicating that
when cells did commit to mitosis, entry was delayed.
Consistent with mitotic entry being required for antimitotic
induced apoptosis, the cumulative cell death frequency
curves also plateaued well below 100% (Fig. 1E). Thus,
these observations confirm that when cells enter mitosis
in the presence of BI 2536, entry is delayed and that
following mitotic entry, subsequent cell cycle progression
is blocked leading to cell death. However, because a
substantial proportion of BI 2536-treated cells fail to enter
mitosis, they are protected from the apoptotic response
that is typically induced by antimitotic agents.

BI 2536 blocks mitotic entry in transformed and
non-transformed cells
To define the long-term fate of Plk1 inhibition,
HeLa cells expressing a GFP-tagged histone H2B were
synchronized using a single thymidine block, released for
four hours, then exposed to 100 nM BI 2536 (Fig. 1B).
One hour later, the cells were subjected to fluorescence
time-lapse microscopy for 72 hours. Image sequences
were then analyzed manually; 100 randomly selected
cells were tracked and chromatin morphology used to
monitor mitotic progression and apoptosis. To represent
the data in a manner that facilitates comparative analyses
without obscuring the complexity, we plotted fate
profiles as described previously ([26] and see Fig. 1C).
Note that unless stated otherwise, zero hours represents
when a cell entered mitosis. In the absence of BI
2536, 70% of the cells underwent three cell divisions
during the 72 hour period, indicating that the imaging
conditions were relatively benign (Fig. 1D). In the
presence of BI 2536 a substantial proportion of cells
underwent mitotic arrest with a polo phenotype, followed
several hours later by apoptosis (Fig. 1D, red lines),
consistent with previous observations [27]. However,
only 43% of cells entered mitosis, arrested and died;
52% of the cells never entered mitosis during the
72 hour period (Fig. 1D, yellow lines). To determine if
other cell lines behave similarly, we analyzed DLD-1
cells, a diploid, chromosomally stable colon cancer line,
and hTERT-immortalized non-transformed RPE-1 cells.
DLD-1 cells are slippage prone [26], i.e. following a
prolonged mitotic arrest, they tend to exit mitosis and

BI 2536 induces a penetrant mitotic entry block
in RKO cells
While testing the effect of BI 2536 on various
cell lines, we noticed that mitotic entry was profoundly
affected in RKO cells, with more than 90% of the
population failing to enter during the 72-hour imaging
period (Fig. 2A). We therefore chose RKO cells as a
model system for further analysis. To determine whether
the mitotic entry failure was a synthetic effect due to the

combination of the thymidine-based synchronization and
Plk1 inhibition, we repeated the experiment using an
asynchronous population, i.e. without the thymidine block
and release. Under these conditions, the vast majority of
cells still failed to enter mitosis (Fig. 2A). Similarly, to
determine whether the fluorescent imaging procedure
was inducing a synthetic effect, we used phase-contrast
imaging to follow cell fate. When synchronized RKO
cells were exposed to 100 nM BI 2536 and analyzed by
phase-contrast imaging, greater than 95% of cells failed to
enter mitosis (Fig. 2A). Thus, the failure to enter mitosis
does not appear to be a consequence of damage induced
by either the thymidine synchronization or the fluorescent
imaging. Interestingly, 24% of cells in the asynchronous
population entered mitosis, indicating that RKO cells are
capable of entering mitosis in the presence of BI 2536.
To explore this further, we reduced the drug concentration
to 25 nM. Under these conditions, 76% of cells entered
mitosis and arrested, with 44% undergoing death in
mitosis and 26% undergoing slippage followed by postmitotic apoptosis (Fig. 2A, green lines). This suggests
that while penetrant Plk1 inhibition blocks mitotic entry
in RKO cells, partial inhibition allows mitotic entry but
then disrupts spindle assembly to an extent sufficient to
trigger mitotic arrest. Analysis of the cumulative mitotic
entry frequencies confirmed this (Fig. 2B). At 100 nM
BI 2536, mitotic entry was almost completely blocked,
while at 25 nM, mitotic entry was delayed but approached
75%. These observations raise an interesting paradox,
highlighted by the cumulative death frequencies (Fig. 2B).
Specifically, the higher concentration of BI 2536 protected
cells from apoptosis by blocking mitotic entry. By
contrast, the lower drug concentration permitted mitotic
entry thus leading to extensive apoptosis. These results
reveal that different levels of Plk1 activity are required for
different aspects of cell division; specifically more activity
is required to assemble a bipolar spindle than is required
to enter mitosis.

stained positive for Cenp-F, while the cytoplasm stained
strongly for Cyclin B1 (Fig. 3). By 48 hours, cells positive
for Cenp-F and Cyclin B1 dropped to approximately 60%
and at later time points the nuclei seemed unusually large
(not shown). One possibility is that following a prolonged
G2 delay, the cells skipped mitosis altogether, returning to
interphase and thereby triggering degradation of Cenp-F
and Cyclin B1. A similar phenomenon has been described
following Cdk1 inactivation in HT1080 cells [35]. Mitotic
skipping has also been observed in MCF7 cells treated
with ionizing radiation [36]. While further analysis will
be required to confirm whether or not BI 2536-treated
cells can skip mitosis, the simplest explanation for our
observations is that at the 24 hour time point, the cells are
indeed arresting in G2.

Mitotic entry in the presence of BI 2536 is
subject to non-genetic heterogeneity
Within a population of HeLa cells, approximately
half entered mitosis in the presence of BI 2536, while the
other half arrested in G2 (Fig. 1D). While this difference
might be explained by genetic variation in the population,
we previously showed that cell fate following prolonged
mitotic arrest is subject to non-genetic heterogeneity [26].
Specifically, when we followed pairs of daughter cells
exposed to an Eg5 inhibitor, their fate was often different;
while one sister underwent death in mitosis, the other
underwent slippage. Because genetic drift between
newly formed daughters is expected to be minimal, these
different behaviors are better explained by non-genetic
heterogeneity. We therefore asked whether the ability to
enter mitosis in the presence of BI 2536 was subject to
non-genetic heterogeneity. Asynchronous, untreated GFPH2B HeLa cells were analyzed by time-lapse microscopy
to identify pairs of the daughter cells (Fig. 4). 100 nM
BI 2536 was then added and imaging continued for a
further 72 hours. Daughter pairs were tracked to determine
whether they entered mitosis or arrested in G2. Of 39 pairs,
in 18 cases both daughters entered mitosis, arrested then
died (Fig. 4). In 13 cases, both daughter cells arrested in
interphase. However, in eight cases, one daughter entered
mitosis and died while the other never entered mitosis.
Thus overall, approximately half the population underwent
each fate, consistent with the data in Fig. 1D. However,
while 79% of the daughter pairs underwent the same fate,
21% exhibited different responses. This different behavior
could be explained by stochastic genetic variation,
e.g. arising via chromosome missegregation, but a more
likely explanation is that stochastic variation in the
stability of the networks regulating entry into mitosis
renders cells differentially sensitive to Plk1 inhibition.
Consistent with this notion, the duration of G2 arrest
following DNA damage prior to Plk1-dependent recovery
is also subject to non-genetic heterogeneity [37].

BI 2536 blocks cells in late G2
In light of Plk1’s known ability to regulate
progression into mitosis, we reasoned that the cell cycle
block induced by BI 2536 was likely to be in late G2. To
test this we analyzed two G2 markers, namely Cenp-F and
Cyclin B1. Cenp-F levels rise in S-phase, accumulating in
the nucleus, reaching a maximum in G2 before degradation
during late mitosis [32, 33]. Cyclin B1 increases in late
S-phase, accumulating in the cytoplasm, then translocates
into the nucleus at the onset of mitosis, followed by
degradation at anaphase [34]. RKO cells were exposed to
100 nM BI 2536 for 24–48 hours, then fixed and stained
to detect Cenp-F, Cyclin B1 and the DNA. Consistent
with the BI 2536 inducing a G2 arrest, at the 24 hour
time point, 80% of the nuclei were relatively large and

this we asked whether the G2 arrest induced by BI 2536

Following DNA damage, Plk1 activity is required

is reversible. Asynchronous RKO cells were treated with
100 nM BI 2536 for six hours then the drug washed out
and replaced with fresh media. At hourly time points,
the cells were fixed and stained to detect histone H3
phosphorylated on serine 10 to determine the mitotic
index. As an additional control, we analyzed cells treated
with the Eg5 inhibitor monastrol, which like BI 2536
prevents centrosome separation and thus induces a mitotic
arrest, but unlike BI 2536 does not influence mitotic
entry [39]. In the untreated population, the mitotic index
remained constant at approximately 2.5% (Fig. 5A). In the
monastrol-treated culture, the mitotic index rose to ~13%
within 6 hours, consistent with mitotic entry followed by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell cycle arrest. Consistent with blocking mitotic entry,
the mitotic index of the BI 2536-treated population fell to
less than 1%. Strikingly, following washout of BI 2536,
the mitotic index rose sharply, climbing to ~22% within
6 hours. Thus, the G2 block induced by BI 2536 can be
alleviated by drug washout.

Following washout of BI 2536, cells arrest in
mitosis
To determine whether RKO cells could complete
mitosis following washout of BI 2536, we performed cell
fate profiling. In the absence of drugs, the vast majority of
36477

Oncotarget

RKO cells underwent three cell divisions during a 72-hour
imaging period (Fig. 5B). When continuously exposed
to monastrol, virtually all the cells arrested in mitosis;
34% eventually divided, 34% died in mitosis and 26%
underwent slippage. However, following washout after
a six hour monastrol exposure, the vast majority of cells
underwent three cell divisions, demonstrating that cells can
in principle fully recover. When continuously exposed to
BI 2536, the vast majority of RKO cells arrested in G2,
consistent with the data in Fig. 2A. When BI 2536 was
washed out after a six hour exposure, virtually all the
cells entered mitosis (Fig. 5B), consistent with the data in
Fig. 5A. Strikingly however, these cells did not complete
mitosis; 93% of the population arrested in mitosis for
an average of 17 hours, with 49% then dying in mitosis
and 43% undergoing slippage. Of those that slipped, the
vast majority then died in the subsequent interphase.
Flow cytometry analysis confirmed this: twelve hours
following washout after a six hour BI 2536 exposure, most
cells had a 4n DNA content, consistent with a failure to
complete cell division (Fig. 5C). In line with Plk1’s known
function, we reasoned that the mitotic arrest following
washout of BI 2536 was most likely due to the inability
to assemble a bipolar spindle. To test this we analyzed
spindle morphology following washout of BI 2536. RKO
cells were treated with 100 nM BI 2536 for six hours, the
drug washed out and the cells then fixed six hours later.
Consistent with the data in Fig. 5A, the mitotic index
increased following washout (Fig. 5D). Moreover, 50% of
these cells displayed the polo phenotype and metaphases
and anaphases were rare (Fig. 5D). By contrast, following
a monastrol washout, monopolar figures were rare
and metaphases and anaphases were readily apparent
(Fig. 5D). Thus, the immunofluorescence analysis, the
flow cytometry profiles and the time-lapse imaging all
paint a consistent picture; following washout of BI 2536,
the G2 block is alleviated and cells enter mitosis, but
cell division is blocked due to the inability to assemble a
functional spindle.

to analyze other Plk1 inhibitors, reasoning that if the
second explanation was correct then the inability to fully
recover from washout should be a common feature of all
Plk1 inhibitors.

Full recovery following washout of the novel
Plk1 inhibitor CYC140844
CYC140844, a pyrimidodiazepinone, is a novel,
selective Plk1 inhibitor (Fig. 6A, S1 and see ref. [40]). In
enzyme assays, CYC140844 inhibits Plk1, Plk2 and Plk3
with IC50 values of 36, 113 and 702 nM respectively. When
used at a single concentration of 10 μM, CYC140844 did
not inhibit Akt, Aurora A, Cdk1/Cyclin B1, Cdk2/Cyclin
E, Cdk7/Cyclin H, Cdk9/Cyclin T1, Flt3, Lck or VEGFR1
by more than 50%. When asynchronous HeLa cells were
exposed to CYC140844, the predicted polo phenotype
manifested, with 500 nM required to yield a penetrant
effect (Fig. 6B). Time-lapse imaging of synchronized
RKO cells showed that 50 nM induced a prolonged
mitotic arrest, with 35% of cells eventually dividing
normally, 34% undergoing death in mitosis and 16%
undergoing slippage (Fig. 6C). At 500 nM, CYC140844
potently blocked mitotic entry. Thus, as with BI 2536,
apoptosis induction by CYC140844 was more efficient
at the relatively lower concentration that permitted
mitotic entry (Fig. 6D). Importantly, when CYC140844
was washed out following a six hour exposure, cells not
only entered mitosis but also successfully completed cell
division. Indeed, following washout, the vast majority of
the population divided three times and 48% completed
four divisions (Fig. 6C). Consistent with full recovery,
flow cytometry showed that 12 hours following washout
the vast majority of cells had 2n DNA content, indicating
successful cell division (Fig. 6E). Thus, in contrast to
BI 2536, RKO cells appear to recover fully from a
transient exposure to CYC140844. This suggests therefore
that the inability to fully recover following transient BI
2536 exposure is not due to an execution point issue but
rather because it does not washout well enough to allow
full restoration of Plk1 activity.

Two possibilities could explain incomplete
recovery following washout of BI 2536

Analysis of different Plk1 inhibitors

To explain why RKO cells failed to complete
division following washout of BI 2536, we considered
two possibilities. The first was that the drug simply
failed to washout completely so that Plk1 activity was
not fully restored; note that the phenotype following
washout of 100 nM BI 2536 (Fig. 5B) is not dissimilar
to that observed in the continuous presence of 25 nM
(Fig. 2A). The second possibility is that following
washout, Plk1 activity is fully restored but the cell
cycle has passed a potential execution point where
Plk1 activity primes the cell for spindle assembly. To
distinguish between these two possibilities, we set out

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Because the reversibility characteristics of BI 2536
and CYC140844 are clearly rather different, we asked
whether other commercially available Plk1 inhibitors
behaved like BI 2536 or CYC140844. We focused on four
different inhibitors, namely BI 6727, MLN0905, RO3280
and TAK-960 [30, 41–43], comparing them directly
with CYC140844. RKO cells were analyzed in both the
continuous presence of inhibitor and following washout
after an eight hour exposure. 500 nM BI 6727 induced
a penetrant interphase block, and following washout
the vast majority of cells arrested in mitosis (Fig. 7A).

Thus, like BI 2536, BI 6727 does not wash out well. Most
cells treated with 4 μM MLN0905 entered mitosis then
arrested, with 62% then dying. While only 16% of the
MLN0905-treated cells failed to enter mitosis, we were
reticent to increase the drug concentration further due to
the possibility of off-target effects. However, following
washout, the profile was very similar indicating that
MLN0905 also does not wash out well. Like CYC140844
and BI 6727, 4 μM RO3280 induced a penetrant interphase
block. In addition, when cells did commit to mitosis,
entry was substantially delayed (Fig. 7A). Note that in
the fate profiles shown in Fig. 7, zero hours represents
when imaging started, allowing visualization of the time
to mitotic entry. Following washout, the timing of mitotic
entry was advanced but now virtually all the cells arrested
in mitosis, followed by either death or slippage. 3 μM
TAK-960 behaved similarly, inducing an interphase block
in 32% of cells and substantially delaying mitotic entry in
the rest. Upon washout, mitotic entry was advanced but
then the vast majority arrested in mitosis, again followed
by either death or slippage. Thus, of all the Plk1 inhibitors
we analyzed, the only one compatible with full recover
following washout is CYC140844.

Thus, while inhibiting Aurora A further delays mitotic
entry in Plk1-deficient cells that commit to mitosis, it does
not increase the proportion that block in late G2.

Combining BI 2536 with the Wee1 inhibitor MK1775 alleviates the mitotic entry block
Plk1 promotes mitotic entry by phosphorylating
and activating Cdc25 phosphatases (reviewed in [46]).
This in turn leads to dephosphorylation of Cdk1 on T14
and Y15, thereby alleviating Wee1-mediated inhibition
of Cdk1/Cyclin B1. We reasoned that if the mitotic entry
block induced by BI 2536 was due to inhibition of Plk1mediated activation of Cdc25, then inhibition of Wee1
should alleviate the block and facilitate mitotic entry. To
test this we treated cells with the Wee1 inhibitor MK-1775
[49]. RKO cells treated with 100 nM MK-1775 completed
cell division apparently normally (Fig. 9). Consistent with
observations described above, 250 nM BI 2536 blocked
mitotic entry in 72% of cells and substantially delayed it in
the remaining 28% (Fig. 9). Strikingly, upon simultaneous
exposure to BI 2536 and MK-1775, 94% of cells entered
mitosis and moreover, they did so sooner than those that
entered in the presence of BI 2536 alone (13.9 versus
30.8  hours, Fig. 9). All the cells that entered mitosis
underwent a prolonged arrest, followed by either death in
mitosis or slippage, indicating that inhibiting Wee1 cannot
bypass the need for Plk1 during mitosis. Interestingly,
MK-1775 did not fully restore the timing of mitotic entry
(13.9 versus 5.4 hours), possibly reflecting the activity of
additional Plk1 targets responsible for Cdk1 inhibition
such as Myt1 [46]. Nevertheless, these observations
suggest that the mitotic entry block induced by BI 2536 is
due to a failure to activate Cdc25.

Combining BI 2536 and MLN8054 does not
exacerbate the mitotic entry block
Aurora A cooperates with Plk1 to activate Cdk1
and drive mitotic entry [44–46]. Therefore, we set out to
determine whether inhibition of Aurora A exacerbated the
mitotic block induced by Plk1 inhibition. To do this, we
returned to cell lines that exhibited a mixed response to
BI 2536, namely HeLa and DLD-1 and asked whether
simultaneous inhibition of both kinases increased the
proportion of cells that arrested in G2. First, we treated
HeLa cells with the Aurora A inhibitor MLN8054 [47],
alone and in combination with BI 2536. As expected, 2 μM
MLN8054 disrupted normal mitotic progression [48],
but did not delay mitotic entry (Fig. 8A, 8B). Somewhat
surprisingly, combining MLN8054 with BI 2536 did not
increase the proportion of cells that blocked in interphase
(Fig. 8A). Also, of the cells that did commit to mitosis,
MLN8054 did not enhance the delay induced by BI 2536
(Fig. 8B). In DLD-1 cells, combining MLN8054 with BI
2536 also did not increase the proportion of cells blocked
in interphase (Fig. 8C). However, the time to mitotic
entry did appear to be lengthened (Fig. 8C, note that as in
Fig. 7, for the fate profiles shown in Fig. 8C, zero hours
represents when imaging started). Indeed, quantitation
shows that on average, BI 2536-treated cells took
18.2 hours to enter mitosis while cells exposed to both
BI 2536 and MLN8054 took 26.0 hours (Fig. 8D). While
not statistically significant, most likely due to the sample
size, this is consistent with prior observations showing that
co-inhibition of Plk1 and Aurora A delays mitotic entry [46].

DISCUSSION
We show here a paradoxical relationship between
Plk1 inhibitor concentration and the induction of cell
death, whereby lower concentrations are more effective
at inducing apoptosis. This paradoxical relationship has
been observed before. When Raab and colleagues treated
HeLa cells with BI 2536 at concentrations up to 100 nM,
they observed potent apoptosis induction [49, 50].
At higher concentrations however, mitotic markers
were less abundant and up to ~20% of cells survived.
Our observations provide a simple explanation for this
paradox: at higher concentrations, Plk1 inhibitors block
mitotic entry thereby protecting cells from the apoptosis
induction that typically follows a prolonged mitotic arrest.
Six different Plk1 inhibitors, representing four different
classes, all block mitotic entry, suggesting that this
phenotype is unlikely due to a common off-target effect.
Indeed, Plk1’s ability to drive mitotic entry is a wellcharacterized function, conserved from yeast to man. In

the fission yeast S.pombe, Cdk1/Cyclin B1 becomes active
on the spindle pole in late G2 where it activates the Plo1
kinase [51]. This triggers a feedback loop that enhances
Cdc25 and suppresses Wee1, in turn driving further
activation of Cdk1/Cyclin B1 and mitotic entry. In human
cells, Plk1 is activated on the centrosome many hours
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

before mitotic entry [52]. This is mediated by Bora which
induces a conformational change in Plk1, facilitating
Aurora-A-mediated phosphorylation of Plk1’s T-loop [46].
Via feedback on Cdc25 and Wee1, active Plk1 then helps
drive Cdk1/Cyclin B1 activation and mitotic entry. In
C.elegans, Cdk1 phosphorylates Bora/SPAT-1, enhancing

its ability to bind Plk1 [53]. This latter observation closes
the circle, giving rise to a model whereby low-level
activation of Cdk1 triggers a Plk1-dependent feedback
loop which then drives mitotic entry.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Our observations are consistent with this model.
If the mitotic entry block we observe is due to penetrant
inhibition of Plk1, and if Aurora A acts upstream of Plk1,
then inhibiting Aurora A when Plk1 is fully blocked is

predicted to have no effect. Indeed, at 100 nM BI 2536,
~50% of HeLa cells arrest in G2 and co-inhibition of
Aurora A does not increase this. Of the ~50% cells that
do enter mitosis, co-inhibiting Aurora A extends the
mitotic entry delay, indicating that when Plk1 is not
fully blocked, Aurora A does promote the feedback loop.
A corollary is that when Plk1 is not fully blocked, coinhibition of Aurora A does not shut down the network,
indicating that Aurora is either not an essential component
of the feedback network or that it was not fully inhibited
in our experiments. Consistent with either possibility,
2 μM MLN8054 in isolation had no effect on mitotic entry
timing.
The Cdk1 �Aurora A �Plk1 network exerts mitotic
entry control at the post-translational level. However,
Plk1 also promotes mitosis by regulating gene expression.
Plk1 phosphorylates the forkhead transcription factor
FoxM1 which in turn upregulates genes required for
G2 progression and mitosis, including mitotic cyclins,
the kinetochore protein Cenp-F and Plk1 itself [19, 54].
Thus, the Plk1-FoxM1 positive feedback maintains tight
transcriptional control of mitotic entry. The ability of
Plk1 inhibitors to either block cells in G2 or delay mitotic
entry could therefore be a combination of inhibiting the
transcriptional and/or post-translational controls. However,
why some cells block in G2 and others only delay mitotic
entry is unclear. Indeed, the variation we observe, both
between cell lines and within the same line, is striking. In
RKO, the proportion of cells that block in G2 increases
with increasing inhibitor concentration, approaching
>90%. However, in HeLa cells, the proportion that arrests
in G2 plateaus at ~50%. Thus, while the extent of the
G2 block is titrateable, the plateau differs from line to
line, indicating interline heterogeneity. While this may
be due to genetic differences between the lines, we also
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

observed intraline variation; specifically, daughter cells
subjected to identical environmental conditions often
behaved differently upon exposure to Plk1 inhibitors.
This intraline variation appears to be another example of
non-genetic heterogeneity [26], suggesting that the mitotic
entry feedback networks described above are differentially
sensitive to Plk1 inhibition. Why this is the case is unclear,
but interestingly the rate of Plk1-dependent recovery from
DNA damage is highly variable [37], further supporting
the notion that the mitotic entry feedback networks are
subject to stochastic variation.
Our observations also suggest that different levels
of Plk1 activity are required to drive progress through
different stages of the cell cycle; while a relatively low
level is required to promote mitotic entry, a higher level
is required to assemble a bipolar spindle. Because five
out of the six Plk1 inhibitors we analyzed are not fully
reversible, this gives rise to an interesting phenomenon
following Plk1 inhibitor washout; specifically, the mitotic
entry block is alleviated but cells then arrest in mitosis
due to an inability to assemble a functional spindle, in
turn leading to apoptosis, either in mitosis or following
slippage. This observation has important clinical
implications, because it suggests that Plk1 inhibitors may
be able induce apoptosis even when cells do not pass
through mitosis during the time period where the drug
reaches maximal plasma concentration. If this is the case,
then the less-reversible inhibitors may be more effective.
By the same token however, this may also increase the
toxicity towards dividing non-tumor cells. Of the six Plk1
inhibitors we analyzed, CYC140844 stands out because
it does appear to be fully reversible. In contrast with the
others, while CYC140844 induces a potent G2 arrest,
following washout the population was indistinguishable
from the control. CYC140844 could therefore be a useful
36484

cell synchronization tool. Indeed, when we treated an
asynchronous population of RKO cells with 500  nM
CYC140844 for eight hours, ~80% of the cells entered
mitosis within four hours of washout. By contrast, it took
over 9 hours for a similar number of control cells to enter
(Fig. 7B). Optimization of this approach, and for example
combining it with a prior G1/S block-and-release, could
result in a highly effective synchronization regime.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

were pre-extracted in PEM-T buffer (100 mM PIPES,
1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 90
s. Cells were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PEM-T for
10 minutes, quenched in PBS-glycine for 20 minutes and
stained with the following primary antibodies: rabbit antiphospho-histone H3 (Ser10) 1:500 (Millipore) and TAT-1
mouse anti-tubulin 1:200 (Woods et al 1992). Secondary
antibodies (1:500) used were: Cy2 conjugated donkey antirabbit and Cy3 conjugated donkey anti-mouse (both from
Jackson Immunoreseach).

Cell lines and small molecules

Time-lapse imaging

TA-HeLa, DLD-1, RKO and RPE-1 cells
expressing GFP-tagged histone H2B were as described
[26]. All cell  lines were cultured in DMEM plus 10%
fetal calf serum (LifeTechnologies), 2 mM glutamine,
100 U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin (Lonza).
All lines were grown at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2
incubator. Small molecule inhibitors dissolved in DMSO
were as follows: BI 2536 (Boehringer Ingelheim);
monastrol (Sigma); CYC140844 (Cyclacel Ltd.);
BI 6727, MLN0905 (Axon MedChem), RO3280, MK1775 (Selleck Chemicals); TAK-960 (R&D Systems);
MLN8054 (Millennium Pharmaceuticals). Thymidine
(Sigma), dissolved in water and filter sterilized was used
at 2 mM.

For time-lapse microscopy, cells were seeded in
96-well μClear plates (Greiner) at 1.3 x 104 cells per well
in a volume of 100 μl. Synchronization was performed
by adding thymidine at a final concentration of 2 mM
four hours post-seeding then removed 16 hours later by
washing three times with PBS followed by adding fresh
media. Four hours after thymidine washout, additional
media containing inhibitor(s) was added and imaging
then started one hour later. Fluorescence imaging was
then performed using a Pathway Bioimager 855 (BD
Biosciences), BD Attovision software and a 20x/0.30
UPlan FLN objective. 96-well plates were housed in a
customized chamber to maintain a constant temperature
of 37°C and a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Images
were collected every 5 min as a 2 x 2 montage using an
Orca ER camera (Hamamatsu) with a 0.1 s exposure time.
For analysis of daughter pairs, imaging was performed
for 24 hours in drug-free media prior to addition of fresh
media containing inhibitor. Image sequences were then
viewed using NIH ImageJ software. Cells were tracked
manually and behavior determined by visual inspection of
GFP histone H2B morphology. Timing data was analyzed
and sorted using Microsoft Excel then cell fate profiles and
other graphs created using GraphPad Prism.

Immunofluorescence
To determine the cell cycle phase of interphasearrested cells, 1.4 x 105 cells were seeded onto 19 mm
UV-sterilized glass coverslips, cultured in the presence
of 100 nM BI 2536, then fixed in 1% formaldehyde
in PBS for five minutes (Cenp-F) or in ice-cold 50:50
methanol:acetone for 10 min at −20°C (Cyclin B1).
Following washes in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST),
formaldehyde-fixed cells were quenched in glycine pH 8.5
for 20 min then incubated for 30 minutes with combinations
of primary antibodies diluted in PBS-glycine (CENP-F)
or PBST (Cyclin B1 coverslips) as follows: sheep antiCenp-F SCF1.1 1:1000 [55]; and mouse anti-Cyclin B1
(Upstate) 1:1000. Following washes in PBST, the cells
were incubated with appropriate combinations of the
following secondary antibodies, all diluted 1:500 in PBST:
Cy3 conjugated donkey anti-mouse and Cy3 conjugated
donkey anti-sheep (both from Jackson Immunoreseach).
Following washes in PBST, the cells were stained with
Hoechst 33258 at 1 μg/ml in PBST and mounted in 90%
glycerol, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. Cells were viewed on an
Axioskop 2 microscope (Zeiss), images captured using
a CoolSnap HQ CCD camera (Photometrics) driven by
Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). To determine
spindle morphology, cells were seeded on coverslips
as described above and inhibitors added at the required
concentration for 3 hours. To visualize microtubules, cells

Flow cytometry
To determine the DNA content and mitotic index
by flow cytometry, cells were cultured in 10 cm dishes in
the presence of the appropriate inhibitors. Culture media
was then collected and the remaining cells harvested by
trypsinisation. Cells were then pelleted and washed in
PBS before finally being resuspended in 150 μl PBS plus
350 μl 100% ice-cold ethanol. Cells were then stored
at −20°C for at least 16 hr. Fixed cells were washed
twice in PBS and incubated with rabbit anti-phosphohistone H3 (Ser10)(Millipore) diluted 1:1000 in PBS for
1 hour at 4°C. Following a PBS wash, cells were then
incubated with a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody
(Jackson Immunoresearch) for one hour at 4°C. Cells
were again washed in PBS and resuspended in 500 μl
PBS containing 40 μg/ml propidium iodide, 50 μg/ml
RNase A. Samples were then incubated in the dark at
