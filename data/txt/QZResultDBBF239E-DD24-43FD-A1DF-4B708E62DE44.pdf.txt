ABSTRACT
IRE1α is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane signaling protein
and a cellular stress sensor. The protein harbors a cytosolic dual kinase/
endoribonuclease activity required for adaptive responses to micro-environmental
changes. In an orthotopic xenograft model of human glioma, invalidation of IRE1α
RNase or/and kinase activities generated tumors with remarkably distinct phenotypes.
Contrasting with the extensive angiogenesis observed in tumors derived from
control cells, the double kinase/RNase invalidation reprogrammed mesenchymal
differentiation of cancer cells and produced avascular and infiltrative glioblastomas
with blood vessel co-option. In comparison, selective invalidation of IRE1α RNase
did not compromise tumor angiogenesis but still elicited invasive features and vessel
co-option. In vitro, IRE1α RNase deficient cells were also endowed with a higher ability
to migrate. Constitutive activation of both enzymes led to wild-type-like lesions. The
presence of IRE1α, but not its RNase activity, is therefore required for glioblastoma
neovascularization, whereas invasion results only from RNase inhibition. In this model,
two key mechanisms of tumor progression and cancer cell survival are functionally
linked to IRE1α.

signals depending on the magnitude or duration of the ER
stress [1–4].
The characteristics and domain organization of
IRE1 are essentially conserved in eukaryotes [5–7]. Upon
accumulation of misfolded proteins in the lumen of the
ER, IRE1α proteins undergo a transition from inactive
monomeric forms to active oligomers [2, 6–8], leading
to trans-autophosphorylation and RNase activation [2,
3, 6,  7]. Mammalian IRE1α RNase domain cleaves a
variety of RNAs, a process named “regulated IRE1dependent decay” (RIDD) [9, 10], and also initiates by
a different mechanism the selective and unconventional

INTRODUCTION
Inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1) is
an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident type I
transmembrane protein and a sensor of the Unfolded
Protein Response (UPR). The protein harbors both
intrinsic Ser/Thr kinase and endoribonuclease (RNase)
activities in its cytoplasmic domain. IRE1α is ubiquitously
expressed in mammalian tissues and is an essential stress
sensor at the convergence point of numerous signal inputs
handled by cells. It coordinately regulates anabolic and
catabolic processes and also conveys survival or death

cytoplasmic splicing of the X-box binding protein-1
(XBP1) mRNA  [11]. The spliced XBP1 mRNA is
translated into a transcription factor involved in the
modulation of the UPR and adaptive response to stress,
including ischemia [11–13]. A second signal transduction
cascade mediated by IRE1α relies upon the recruitment
of the multifunctional adaptor protein TRAF2, leading to
the activation of JNK and NF-κB transduction pathways
[1, 14, 15].
IRE1α was shown to contribute to tumor
development through its RNase activity [13, 16–19]. Nonrandom somatic mutations of IRE1α were also reported in a
variety of neoplastic tissues [20]. Moreover, inactivation of
IRE1α by using dominant-negative approaches or siRNAmediated knockdown led to the decrease of pathological
angiogenesis in a human glioblastoma xenograft model
and also drove mesenchymal differentiation and invasive
mechanisms [21]. The latter observation is of particular
interest, as the mesenchymal profile characterizes a major
subclass of high-grade gliomas frequently observed upon
recurrence [22, 23].
Interestingly, angiogenesis and invasiveness are
functionally linked and, to a certain extent, mutually
exclusive [24]. Most importantly, inhibition of
angiogenesis may favor malignant cell dissemination
into the surrounding normal tissues, which represents an
insidious and devastating feature of glioma development
[24–26]. It is therefore crucial to clarify the nature of the
molecular inter-relationships linking these two processes
in order to optimize antitumor therapy.
Here, we examined in more details the contribution
of IRE1α kinase and RNase activities in glioblastoma
angiogenesis and invasion. Inducible and selective
invalidation of either or both catalytic activity was
achieved in malignant cells, and the resulting effects were
analyzed in an orthotopic mouse xenograft model. Several
key parameters of high-grade glioma progression were
monitored, such as the recruitment of new blood vessels,
infiltration of cancer cells and apoptosis. We show that
the selective inhibition of IRE1α RNase activity favors
glioblastoma invasion and blood vessel co-option. In
addition, we establish a correlation between the presence
of a functional IRE1α kinase domain and the occurrence
of tumor angiogenesis.

S1AB). Wild-type IRE1α protein was also expressed in
control cells (Figure S2A). Sustained expression of the
three mutants did not impede tumor cell viability and
neither PERK/eIF2α nor ATF6 branches of the UPR were
activated in these conditions. Indeed, neither eIF2α nor
phospho-eIF2α protein levels were significantly altered
following incubation with doxycycline (Figure S1D).
Similarly, ectopic expression of the different IRE1α
protein mutants did not induce the translocation of a
FLAG-tagged ATF6α protein from the ER membrane into
the nucleus, as observed upon stress condition (Figure S3).
Under doxycycline treatment, expression of IRE1αK599A and IRE1α-Y892A protein variants were readily
detected, whereas that of IRE1α-K907A protein was not
(Figure 1B). In addition, IRE1α phosphorylation at Ser724
(p-IRE1), a marker of protein trans-autophosphorylation,
was observed in cells expressing the Y892A RNase mutant
and was also present at a much lower level in K599A
mutant cells (Figures 1B and 1D). In comparison, IRE1α
kinase activity was not detectable in cells expressing the
IRE1α-K907A mutant (Figures 1B, 1D), even though both
endogenous and ectopic IRE1α transcripts were present
in these cells (Figure S1B). IRE1α RNase activity was
monitored using the splicing of pre-XBP1 mRNA as
readout (Figure 1C). As expected, substitutions of aminoacids residues at positions 599, 892 and 907 by alanine
resulted in a substantial inhibition of XBP1 splicing
(>90%) (Figures 1C and 1D). Thus, expression of each of
the three variants strongly impaired IRE1α RNase activity
toward the splicing of XBP1 mRNA.

Expression of IRE1α kinase and RNase variants
in tumor cells reduces tumor growth and
improves mouse survival
U87-K599A, U87-Y892A, U87-K907A and U87LUC cells were implanted in the brain of RAG2/γc mice.
Doxycycline was delivered in vivo in drinking water for
half of the animals and glioblastoma progression was
monitored at days 17, 27 and 37 by measure of the intratumoral luciferase activity (Figure 2). No difference
in malignant growth was observed with U87-LUC
control cells in the presence or absence of doxycycline
(Figure  2A). In comparison, glioblastomas expressing
either the K599A or Y892A variants exhibited a ≈10fold volume reduction under doxycycline treatment from
day 17 to day 37, and a ≈100-fold volume reduction was
obtained with the K907A mutant at day 37. Congruent
with growth measures, median survival of mice engrafted
with cells expressing IRE1α-K599A, IRE1α-Y892A
or IRE1α-K907A mutations increased respectively by
5  (12%), 7 (14%) and 48 (109%) days as compared to
their cognate controls without doxycycline (Figure 2B).
Mutations invalidating either the IRE1α kinase
or RNase therefore led to decreased glioblastoma
growth and to improved outcome, the best effect being
obtained with the K907A mutant. Higher median survival

Production and characterization of IRE1α
catalytic mutants
Three catalytic mutants of IRE1α were generated
by site-directed mutagenesis, including a kinaseinactive variant (K599A) and two endoribonucleaseinactive variants (Y892A and K907A) (Figure 1A). U87
glioblastoma cells were transduced with an inducible TetON vector expressing the different IRE1 mutants or GFP

immunoprecipitation using anti-IRE1 protein antibodies. IRE1α was revealed by immunoblotting using either antibodies against phospho(Ser724)-IRE1α (p-IRE1) or against total IRE1α (IRE1). β-actin was used as internal control. Pixel intensities of IRE1α proteins normalized

showing a greater mitotic index (~15%) than cells

and loosely cohesive lesions (Figures  3Ab and 3Ae).
These tumors were also diffuse, poorly delineated, and
elaborated an invasive network by colonizing perivascular
areas of normal blood vessels (white arrows) from the
immediate vicinity of the tumor core up to distal sites
(Figures 3Ab and 3B). In comparison, U87-K599Aderived glioblastomas exhibited intermediate features of
invasion, with a lower penetrance (~60% of the tumors
presented infiltrative contours; Figure 3Ac and 3C) and
no detectable vessel co-option. Finally, U87-K907Aderived glioblastomas that did not significantly express
IRE1α were essentially avascular, developed at a much
slower rate, and presented typical features of invasion
with perivascular cuffing (Figures 3Ad, 3Ae, 3B and
3C). The re-arrangement of the tumor shape observed in
U87-Y892A- and U87-K907A-derived tumors confirmed
our previous observations in glioblastomas deficient for
IRE1α signaling [21].
Triple immunofluorescence staining was then
performed to better characterize the vascular pattern of
these tumors (Figure 4A). Proliferative blood vessels
and vessel density were quantified by labeling endoglin
(ENG) and CD31, respectively, and their expression ratios
(ENG vs. CD31) in tumors were compared to values
obtained from the cerebral vascular bed (Figures  4B
and S6). These markers were expressed at a low level

The morphology of tumors formed by cells
expressing IRE1α variants was examined by
immunofluorescence microscopy at day 28 (K599 and
Y892A mutants) or at day 42 (K907A mutant) postimplantation. In the absence of doxycycline (Figures 3Aa
and S5), all tumors exhibited typical characteristics of
compact, homogenous, well-delineated and aberrantly
vascularized tissues. The phenotype was also observed
in tumors overexpressing an ectopic IRE1wt protien
(Figure  S2). Under doxycycline treatment, the IRE1αY892A mutation generated bulky, highly vascularized

in the quiescent brain vasculature. In comparison,
control neoplasms as well as U87-K599A- and
U87-Y892A-derived tumors were highly angiogenic, as
depicted by positive CD31 and ENG staining. A robust
NG2 proteoglycan immunoreactivity, a consistent
marker of high-grade gliomas [27], was also observed.
Localized angiogenic “hot spots” were detected within
U87-Y892A-derived tumors (Figure 4A, green circle)
and were sometimes regionally distinguished at a distance
of only a few micrometers from vessel-co-opted areas
(orange circle). Comparatively, U87-K907A-derived
tumors were essentially avascular (Figure 4Bab). Thus,
inhibition of the neovascularization process was only
detected in IRE1α mutants deficient for both kinase and
RNase activities (Figures 4A–4B). Notably, the nonangiogenic and co-opted phenotype of U87-K907Aderived tumors was maintained over time (up to 78 days
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

post-implantation; Figure S6). Hence, no redundant
angiogenic signaling emerged from invalidation of both
catalytic domains of IRE1α in this time interval.

IRE1α RNase deficient glioblastomas exhibit
mesenchymal features
The diffuse phenotype of IRE1α-deficient
glioblastomas was prominent in U87 cells expressing
Y892A and K907A variants. Infiltrative cells were
elongated and tumor tissues showed a fibrous aspect,
as compared to control tumors (Figure 5A). To evaluate
changes in the gene expression program in these tumors,
qPCR analyses were carried out on a selection of
representative mesenchymal markers whose up-regulation
was previously observed in cells deficient for IRE1α
signaling [21]. Glioblastomas expressing IRE1α variants

proteins involved in invasion (Figure 5B). Collagens
(COL1A1, COL3A1 and COL5A1) and the collagen

increased in the presence of doxycycline. In addition,
both U87-Y892 and U87-K907-derived tumors displayed

[22, 23]. Consistently, elevated YKL-40 immunoreactivity
was observed in glioblastomas expressing IRE1α variants
(Figure 5C, upper panel), except for few U87-K599Aderived tumors. The fluorescent signal in U87-Y892Aderived tumors in the presence of doxycycline was about
twice higher than in control tumors and a 20% increase
was observed in U87-K907A-derived tumors (Figure 5C,

not found statistically different from control tumors.

that simulated ischemia. Migration of individual cells
under a gradient of serum/glucose was recorded in

behavior in vivo, cells expressing IRE1α-Y892A and
IRE1α-K907A variants were endowed with a better
ability to move toward higher concentrations of serum/

was measured in the presence of doxycycline relative

enhanced in wild-type U87-MG cells treated with the

its possible contribution to the neovascularization and
invasive processes. If relevant, deletion of this segment
would be expected to negatively interfere with the

mutant was thus generated exhibiting a 10 aminoacids
deletion in its C-terminus, from the glutamate residue
at position 967 to the end (IRE1α-ΔE967 mutant)

glioma vascularization and invasion. Notably, permanent

in this malignancy. Intense microvascular proliferation
correlates with higher histologic grades of gliomas [25],
an observation which has led to the development of
efficient anti-angiogenic strategies aimed at blocking the
disease progression. However, these treatments may also
stimulate the invasive growth behavior of glioblastoma
cells, thereby leading to relapses with diffuse patterns and
perivascular growth [24, 26]. The cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying these distinct effects are not well
understood.
IRE1α, the most conserved stress sensor of the UPR,
is a single-pass transmembrane protein of the ER. Under
cellular stress, allosteric triggering of IRE1α leads to its
trans-autophosphorylation and RNase activation [2, 3,
6, 7]. IRE1α downstream signal transduction then involves
a set of distinct mechanisms including i) activation of
JNK and NF-κB, ii) IRE1α RNase-mediated RNA decay
(RIDD) of RNA and iii) unconventional splicing of XBP1
mRNA [1, 2, 9, 10, 14, 15].
The role of IRE1α signaling in cancer progression
remains to be fully clarified. The IRE1α/XBP1
transduction axis clearly contributes in tumor development

DISCUSSION
High-grade gliomas represent the most common
primary brain neoplasms in human and are associated
with a poor clinical outcome [25]. Important efforts have
therefore been developed in order to better understand the
pivotal roles of pathological angiogenesis and invasiveness

mediating the adaptive response to ischemia [29]. Such
a beneficial response to stress may however adversely
support tumor resistance to chemotherapies [30, 31].
To this end, both pro- and anti-neoplastic properties of
the ER-stress are being currently considered for new
therapeutic avenues [2, 30, 31]. As such, functional
blockade of IRE1α produced ambivalent antitumor
effects in a glioblastoma xenograft model by inhibiting
angiogenesis and concurrently inducing cancer cell
migration [18, 21].
In order to evaluate more precisely the implication
of IRE1α in these distinct outcomes, we examined in this
work the effects of single amino-acid substitutions in
IRE1α catalytic domains on glioblastoma development.
To this end, one mutant was designed to invalidate IRE1α
kinase activity (K599A) whereas two others (Y892A and
K907A) targeted IRE1α RNase domain.
As expected, expression of the Y982A RNase
mutant abolished XBP1 splicing under ER stress.
The protein variant also exhibited an elevated rate of
autophosphorylation, consistent with its high level of
expression [8, 32]. In vivo, expression of the Y892A
mutant constrained glioblastoma progression but did
not impede the formation of new blood vessels, whose
general architecture was not different from that of control
tumors. However, as compared with massive and welldelineated U87 control tumor bulks, glioblastomas
expressing the IRE1α-Y892A mutant were invariably
diffuse and harbored two distinct features of invasion:
a short-range infiltration at the immediate periphery
of glioblastoma cores, and an extensive blood vessel
co-option with formation of distal perivascular tumor
microsatellites. These two modes of dissemination were
also recognized within the core of IRE1α-Y892A gliomas,
therefore suggesting that they might reflect an intrinsic
property of tumor cells rather than a reaction to the microenvironmental selection pressure. Thus, blockade of the
IRE1α RNase induced a major phenotypic switch towards
a pro-invasive mode.
The dual phenotype of IRE1α-Y892A glioblastomas
indicates that the formation of new blood vessels does not
preclude cancer cell dissemination or co-option. Such a
mixed phenotype has been reported in other preclinical
models [33], and high-grade glioma cells of mesenchymal
subtype also elicit both infiltrative and angiogenic
characters [22, 23]. Similarly, invasive/co-optive IRE1α
dominant-negative glioblastomas concomitantly exhibited
a highly vascularized pattern when producing ectopic
interleukin-6 [21].
Expression of the second RNase mutant K907A
resulted in glioblastoma cells that are essentially deficient
for IRE1α. In vivo, this mutant recapitulated the main
characteristics obtained by using either IRE1α silencing
or IRE1 dominant-negative constructs [21]: avascular
and infiltrative tumors were obtained and the growth
rate of malignant cells was dramatically lower. Hence,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

both U87-Y892A and U87-K907A cells promoted
the development of infiltrative glioblastomas and also
exhibited a higher velocity in vitro. This result is in
agreement with the higher potential of wild-type tumor
cells to migrate in culture in the presence of 4 μ8C, a
small-molecule IRE1α inhibitor.
Similar analyses were also performed with the
K599A mutant. In our experimental conditions, a low
level of auto-phosphorylation was still observed (see
also ref. [5]). Likewise, a minor splicing of XBP1 was
detected upon tunicamycin treatment in ~20% of our
assays, which correlates with the low RNase activity
detected in cells expressing the same mutant under
thapsigargin treatment [34]. These effects presumably
resulted from the endogenous activity of the wildtype IRE1α protein, although the existence of positive
crosstalks from cytoplasmic kinases to IRE1α could not
be excluded [35, 36]. The fact that remnant functions of
IRE1α still exist in cells expressing the IRE1α-K599A
mutant is also consistent with in vitro experiments
showing that dephosphorylated or kinase dead IRE1α
from yeast or human still exhibited low RNase activity
following oligomerization [8, 32]. This residual IRE1α
activity provided a rationale to the fact that glioblastomas
expressing IRE1α-K599A mutant exhibited moderate
infiltrative features: diffuse lesions had lower penetrance
(~60%), grew less compact than control tumors and no
co-option was observed. Besides, the vascularization
pattern in these tumors was similar to that observed in
wild-type tumors.
Invasiveness was shown to correlate with the
overexpression of matrix proteins in the mesenchymal
glioma subtype [22, 23]. Since abrogation of the IRE1α
RNase activity reprograms cells towards a motile
behavior, we therefore considered the production of matrix
proteins in this glioma model. Clearly, cells expressing
IRE1α RNase mutants heightened the expression of ECM
markers characteristic of glioblastoma malignancy or
invasion, including fibrillar collagens, the collagen crosslinker LOX and the proteins THBS1, YKL-40, DCN and
LAMA4 [22, 23, 37]. These results are consistent with
the mesenchymal gene expression signature associated to
U87 cells in culture or in preclinical models, either after
blockade of IRE1α function [21] or following treatments
with anti-angiogenic agents [38, 39]. This suggests that the
inhibition of signaling events downstream of IRE1α RNase
activity, involving the cytosolic RNA decay (RIDD)
and/or XBP1 mRNA splicing [9, 12], might contribute to
mesenchymal transformation. The inhibition of IRE1αmediated cleavage of mRNAs encoding the invasion
marker SPARC and other ECM candidate targets [9, 18],
as well as of microRNAs [40] functionally associated
to tumor invasiveness [41–43], could participate to this
phenotypic switch.
The functional analysis of IRE1α mutants in
this glioblastoma model provides evidence of two
distinct contributions of IRE1α in pathological invasion
24930

Site directed mutagenesis and expression of

and angiogenesis, respectively. Indeed, invalidation
of the RNase activity was sufficient for triggering
invasiveness. In addition, our data suggest a permissive
role of IRE1α, but not of its RNAse activity, in glioma
neovascularization. IRE1α kinase activity was found to
express selective functions in animals and plants [14, 15,
44, 45] and therefore represents an attractive candidate for
regulating blood vessel formation. Indeed, in the absence
of its RNase domain, the IRE1α cytosolic moiety still
has the ability to recruit the adaptor protein TRAF-2,
which represents a potential contributor to angiogenesis
through activation of JNK and NF-kB-dependent signaling
pathways [14, 15]. How this system is modulated in vivo,
however, remains an open question.
Finally, it should be emphasized that glioblastomas
expressing any of the IRE1α mutations reported here
developed at a slower rate than the control lesions, the
overall survival of implanted animals being consistently
prolonged in each case. We showed that apoptosis was
not the primary cause of the decrease in tumor growth.
This  effect resulted at least in part of a lower mitotic
index, which agreed well with the positive correlation
reported between the activity of the IRE1α/XBP1 branch
and tumor cell proliferation [16, 21, 29, 34].
In conclusion, our results suggest that IRE1α
is a major molecular integrator of angiogenesis and
mesenchymal differentiation under the control of
biological and chemical stimuli. From the clinical
perspective, an appealing anti-tumor combination would
be to maintain IRE1α RNase activity (anti-invasive effect)
while blocking kinase functions (anti-angiogenic effect).
Interestingly, such a prospect was recently substantiated
in vitro by using either ATP-competitive small molecules
inhibitors [3, 46] or invalidation mutants of the protein
kinase active site [47] that potently activate IRE1α
endoribonuclease. Nevertheless, the relevance of such
approaches has to be appreciated in a biological context,
considering the fact that the IRE1α/XBP1 branch was
also reported to signal angiogenesis in other malignancies
[13]. Understanding and delineating IRE1α-dependent
downstream pathways involved in tumor cell infiltration
and blood vessel proliferation should help to consider new
therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of malignant
gliomas.

Human IRE1α cDNA was obtained from the
plasmid pEDhIRE1 kindly provided by R. Kaufman. The
residues lysine-599, tyrosine-892 and lysine-907 were
substituted by alanine using the Quickchange II XL sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Agilent). Mutants truncated
in the C-terminal segment of IRE1 (proline-965 and
glutamate-967) were generated by introducing a stop
codon in the IRE1α ORF at these positions. A HindIII/
XhoI fragment of pcDNA3.1-hIRE1 was replaced with
the homologous mutated fragments. IRE1α-mutated
sequences were confirmed by sequencing and subcloned
into the lentiviral vector pTRIP-DU3-TRETight (Genomic
Platform, Université P. Sabatier, Toulouse, France) to
obtain pTRIP-hIRE1 -K599A, -Y892A, -K907A, -ΔP965
and -ΔE967 constructs. The Tet-ON empty vector and
the same vector expressing GFP (pTRIP-GFP) were
also used. Vectors were transduced in a polyclonal
U87-MG cell population expressing luciferase (U87-LUC
cells). Proteins were expressed under the control of the
doxycycline promoter.

Cell culture
Cells were grown in DMEM, 4.5 g/L glucose
supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine, and
antibiotics. Gene expression under the dependence of the
Tet-ON promoter was induced in culture by adding 2 μg/ml
doxycycline for two days (K599A, Y892A and K907A
mutants) or for seven days (ΔP965 and ΔE967 mutants).

ATF6α activation assay
Measure of ATF6α activation was performed as
previously reported [48]. Cells were transiently transfected
with FLAG-ATF6α and incubated for 24 h with or without
2 μg/ml doxycycline. U87 control cells over-expressing
IRE1α wild-type protein (IRE1wt) or bearing the empty
vector (EV) were analyzed following incubation for 3 h
with or without DTT. FLAG-ATF6α protein and calnexin
(CNX) were revealed simultaneously by using antiFLAG mouse antibodies and anti-CNX rabbit antibodies,
respectively, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor
488-labeled anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 568-labeled
anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies.

DMEM containing 1.5 mg/ml of collagen I without serum
and glucose. Microplates were then filled with DMEM
medium with or without 10% FBS, 1 mg/ml glucose
and 2 μg/ml doxycycline. Time-lapse microscopy was
carried out in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C
using a Zeiss observer Z1 videomicroscope (Carl Zeiss)
and photomicrographs were taken at constant intervals of
15 min for 12 h. Four to six different fields were recorded
for each condition using the AxioVision Rel 4.8 software.
Quantitative image analysis of cell motility tracking was
processed using the ImageJ software (25 ≤ n ≤ 50; cells
per field). Statistical significance was evaluated by using
a non-parametric t-test for comparison between different
culture conditions in a single mutant, and by one-way
ANOVA when comparing each pair of mutants.
