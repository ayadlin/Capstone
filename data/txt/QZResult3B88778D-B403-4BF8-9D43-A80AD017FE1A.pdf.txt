ABSTRACT
B7 family proteins are important immune response regulators, and can mediate
oncogenic signaling and cancer development. We have used human triple-negative
breast cancer cell lines with different expression levels of B7-H3 to evaluate its
effects on the sensitivity to 22 different anticancer compounds in a drug screen.
API-2 (triciribidine) and everolimus (RAD-001), two inhibitors that target the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway, showed enhanced inhibition of cell viability and proliferation
in B7-H3 knockdown tumor cells compared to their B7-H3 expressing counterparts.
Similar inhibition was seen in control cells treated with an anti-B7-H3 monoclonal
antibody. In B7-H3 overexpressing cells, the effects of the two drugs were reduced,
supported also by in vivo experiments in which B7-H3 overexpressing xenografts
were less sensitive to everolimus than control tumors. In API-2 and everolimustreated B7-H3 overexpressing cells, phospho-mTOR levels were decreased. However,
phosphorylation of p70S6K was differentially regulated in B7-H3 cells treated with
API-2 or everolimus, suggesting a different B7-H3-mediated mechanism downstream
of mTOR. Both API-2 and everolimus decreased the glycolysis of the cells, whereas
knockdown of B7-H3 decreased and B7-H3 overexpression increased the glycolytic
capacity. In conclusion, we have unveiled a previously unknown relationship between
B7-H3 expression and glycolytic capacity in tumor cells, and found that B7-H3 confers
resistance to API-2 and everolimus. The results provide novel insights into the
function of B7-H3 in cancer, and suggest that targeting of B7-H3 may be a novel
alternative to improve current anticancer therapies.

INTRODUCTION

These proteins can be divided into three groups, according
to the signals they transduce during T cell activation: I)
co-stimulatory (e.g. B7-1 and B7-2); II) inhibitory
(e.g. B7-H1); and III) co-stimulatory/inhibitory (e.g.
B7-H3 and B7-H4) [2, 3]. The B7 proteins are mostly
expressed in the plasma membrane and interact with

The B7 family of immune receptors is considered
essential in the regulation of the adaptive immune system,
but its members are also expressed in non-hemopoietic
tissues and are emerging as important players in cancer [1].

receptor partners in T and NK cells, which mediate their
immune modulatory functions, but their partners in nonhemopoietic cells are mostly unknown [4–6].
B7-H3 is overexpressed in many types of
carcinomas (including breast, colorectal, pancreas, prostate
and lung cancer), and in sarcomas and melanomas [7–12],
but is not expressed, or expressed at low levels, in most
normal cells or tissues [13, 14]. Interestingly, a new breast
cancer detection approach was recently reported by using
B7-H3-targeted ultrasound molecular imaging [15]. It has
been suggested that B7-H3 plays a role in immune evasion
of breast cancer [16]. However, the precise molecular
basis for the functional role of B7-H3 in cancer remains
unclear. In this context, we have identified an oncogenic
non-immunological role of B7-H3 in melanoma and
breast cancer, which promotes metastasis and resistance
to chemotherapy. These effects could be exerted through
regulation of proteins in the JAK2/STAT3 signaling
pathways, as well as by modulating the expression of
cytokines and other metastasis-associated genes [12, 17].
Around 15% of all breast cancers do not express
estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/Neu), and are classified
as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This type of
breast cancer is amongst the most aggressive types, with
poor overall survival, mainly due to the lack of specific
therapies. Thus, more efficient therapeutic options for
TNBC patients are needed. B7-H3 expression is elevated
in TNBC, and high expression has been associated with
tumor progression and metastasis, as well as with shorter
recurrence-free survival [18–22]. B7-H3 has emerged as
a new potential target in TNBC and other cancer types,
and its targeting by monoclonal and bispecific antibodies
(MGA271; MacroGenics, MGD009; MacroGenics, H89;
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) are currently
being studied in several phase I clinical trials in
patients with B7-H3-positive cancers, including TNBC
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01391143, NCT0191893, NCT02
381314, NCT02475213, NCT01099644, NCT01502917,
NCT00089245) [23, 24].
In this study, we have assessed the role of B7-H3
in the viability of human TNBC cell lines, and performed
a drug screening to evaluate the effect of a panel of
different anticancer compounds. We found that the effect
of API-2 (triciribidine) and everolimus (RAD-001), two
small molecule inhibitors targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway, was partially dependent on B7-H3 expression.
API-2 and everolimus, as well as decreased expression of
B7-H3, reduced the rate of glycolysis. Our data support
the notion that targeting B7-H3 may a valuable adjunctive
approach to improve breast cancer therapy.

Decreased expression and inhibiton of B7-H3
increases the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to
AKT/mTOR inhibitors API-2 and everolimus
We have previously established MDA-MB-435 and
MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell lines with stable knockdown
of B7-H3 expression (shB7-H3) or scrambled (TR33 here
referred to as shSCR) via short hairpin RNA (Figure 1A,
left and middle panels), as described previously [17]. We
have now also generated MDA-MB-231 cell lines stably
overexpressing B7-H3 (Figure 1A, right panel). Growth,
measured as cell confluence of parental, and control vector
or shSCR cells was similar (Supplementary Figure S1).
B7-H3 knockdown decreased cell proliferation as measured
by MTS after 3 days of culture (Figure 1B, and as reported
previously [17, 25]). Moreover, growth of shB7-H3
MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-231 cells, measured as cell
confluence during 3–4 days was significantly decreased,
whereas a slight significant increase was observed in
B7-H3 cells (Figure 1C).
The B7-H3 knockdown and control cell variants
were screened for cell viability using a library of
22 compounds. The screening revealed that several
drugs showed significantly different efficacy in
B7-H3 knockdown compared to control cells in both the
MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. All drug
concentrations and relative drug responses are listed in
Supplementary Table S1. Interestingly, two small molecule
inhibitors targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway:
API-2 (Triciribidine, AKT inhibitor) and everolimus
(mTOR inhibitor) showed a weak, though significant,
enhanced growth inhibitory effect in B7-H3 knockdown
cells (shB7-H3), compared to the control cells (shSCR)
(Figure 2A). This was observed using a) cell viability
assay in the drug screening (CTG, Figure 2A, left panels);
b) cell proliferation assay (MTS, Figure 2A, right panels);
and c) cell growth assay (measured as cell confluence,
Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S2A). Furthermore,
overexpression of B7-H3 diminished the inhibitory
effect on proliferation (Figure 3A) and cell confluence
(Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure S2C).
We tested if we could see similar effect on cell
growth of parental MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231
cells by targeting B7-H3 using an inhibitory antiB7-H3 monoclonal antibody (BRCA84D). As shown in
Figure 2C, both parental MDA-MB-435 and MDAMB-231 cell confluence were reduced in the presence of the
anti-B7-H3 (α-B7-H3), similar to that of knocking down
B7-H3 (Figure 2B). Additionally, α-B7-H3 pre-treated
cells showed significant enhanced growth inhibitory effect
of API-2 and everolimus, compared to the control treated
cells (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure S2B).

Immunoblot analysis showed that the protein
expression levels of B7-H3 did not change after drug
treatment of the cell variants (Figures 2D and 3C). Western
blot band intensities are shown in panels next to the blots.
Neither of the two drugs induced changes in the cellular
localization of B7-H3 assessed by immunofluorescence
(data not shown).

in these animals (data not shown). Overexpression of B7-H3
by itself did not change the in vivo growth rate of the
cells (Figure 3D, top panel). Everolimus showed a clear
antitumor effect in the mice carrying MDA-MB-231 control
vector xenografts. In the B7-H3 overexpressiong xenografts,
however, no significant effect of everolimus was seen
(Figure 3D, bottom panel). These results are in line with the
in vitro data. We did not see changes in the morphology of
the tumors. The difference in average tumor volume (mm2)
of the treated versus control xenografts assessed at each time
point became statistically significant from day 42 until the
end of the experiment (*p values at each time point were
between 0.0212 and 0.0363). Together the results strengthen
the conclusion that B7-H3 plays an important role in the
sensitivity of breast cancer cells to everolimus.
We also tested MDA-MB-435 B7-H3 knockdown
and control cells in vivo, by s.c. injection in nude mice
treated intraperitoneally with API-2 (5 mg/kg, twice a
week). However, in this experimental setting we did not
see any inhibitory effect of API-2 on tumor growth in vivo
(data not shown).

Increased expression of B7-H3 confers resistance
of breast cancer cells to everolimus in vivo
Next, we examined whether the observed in vitro
effects of the inhibitors could be confirmed in vivo. MDAMB-231 B7-H3 knockdown, overexpression, and control
cells were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) in nude mice. The
animals were treated with everolimus (5 mg/kg, three times
a week for the first three weeks and thereafter twice a week
for 4 weeks) administered by gavage when the tumors had
reached a mean diameter of 5 to 6 mm. In MDA-MB-231
shB7-H3 cells, the tumor inhibitory effect of knocking
down B7-H3 by itself impeded the analysis of drug effects

overexpressing cells showed a significantly increased
phospho-p70S6K level (Figure 4A, right panel).
However, in everolimus-treated MDA-MB-231 cells we
observed decreased phospho-p70S6K levels in B7-H3

API-2 and everolimus reduce the glycolysis of
breast cancer cells

everolimus decreased basal glycolysis in MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 5B). Together, these results show that API-2
and everolimus decrease the intracellular basal glycolysis
in MDA-MB-231 cells, as has been previously found in
other cancer cells [29, 30]. In MDA-MB-435 cells treated
with API-2 we observed slightly lower L-lactate and
ECAR levels, yet not significant (data not shown).

We did not observe differences in cell cycle
distribution or cell death by apoptosis nor necrosis in
the B7-H3 cell variants upon treatment with the API-2
and everolimus inhibitors (data not shown), and looked
therefore into other mechanistic explanation of the
observed antiproliferative effect. Since members of AKT/
mTOR/p70S6K pathway is known to be master regulators
of aerobic glycolysis in normal tissue as well as in cancer
cells [27, 28], we wanted to test whether the two inhibitors
had any effect on metabolism. Hence, we measured the
L-lactate levels in cell media as a readout of the intracellular
glycolytic activity. We observed significantly reduced
L-lactate levels in MDA-MB-231 cells upon treatment with
both API-2 and everolimus (Figure 5A, upper panel). The
same wells were stained with crystal violet, and show equal
amount of cells in all conditions (Figure 5A, lower panel).
Further ExtraCellular Acidification Rate (ECAR)
was measured as a readout of the basal glycolysis using the
Seahorse technology, and confirmed that both API-2 and

Decreasing expression of B7-H3 reduces
glycolytic capacity of breast cancer cells treated
with API-2 and everolimus
Next, we analyzed the effect of B7-H3 expression
on glycolysis, and in MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231
B7-H3 knockdown cells the glycolytic capacity was
decreased (Figure 5C and 5D, left panels), while cells
with overexpressed B7-H3 had higher glycolytic capacity
(Figure 5E, left panel). Importantly, as shown in Figure 1B
and 1C, overexpressing B7-H3 in MDA-MB-231 cells
had weak impact on cell proliferation, suggesting that the
effect of B7-H3 on glycolytic capacity is independent of
the proliferative rate of the cells.

Since both the inhibitors and decreased B7-H3
expression reduced the basal glycolysis and glycolytic
capacity, respectively, we tested if we could observe an
additive effect on the glycolytic capacity. Upon treatment
with API-2 the glycolytic capacity in shSCR MDA-MB-435
cells was higher than in the shB7-H3 cells (Figure 5C,

right panel). Also, the glycolytic capacity in API-2- or
everolimus-treated MDA-MB-231 shSCR cells was
higher than in treated shB7-H3 cells (Figure 5D, middle
and right panels). The opposite effect was observed in the
B7-H3 overexpressing cells where glycolytic capacity was
increased compared to the control vector cells (Figure 5E,

middle and right panels). Together, these results
demonstrate that B7-H3 knockdown decreases glycolytic
capacity in breast cancer cells, in addition to the decrease
in glycolysis induced by API-2 and everolimus. These
results suggest independent mechanisms of inhibition
of glycolysis, supporting the notion that a combinatorial
approach of inhibiting both B7-H3 and glycolysis (e.g.
mTOR/AKT/p70S6K) pathway would be beneficial.

Together, these results suggest that API-2 and everolimus
inhibition together with B7-H3 knockdown would act in
concert by putative different mechanisms.
Several B7 family members have emerged as feasible
therapeutic targets in cancer immunotherapy [36–38],
including B7-H3 in breast cancer [39, 40]. Regardless of its
regulatory immunological functions, non-immunological
roles for B7-H3 in tumor biology have also been identified.
We have shown that B7-H3 expression correlated
with increased migration and invasion in vitro [25],
which was confirmed by in vivo studies showing a
decreased metastatic potential in nude mice injected with
B7-H3 knockdown cancer cells [12]. In addition, we
reported a connection between the expression of B7-H3
and the resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug Paclitaxel
in breast cancer cells [17]. These results, together with
our current findings on the B7-H3-mediated resistance to
small molecule inhibitors, may indicate a more general
association between B7-H3 expression and drug resistance
in cancer. Hence, we speculate that B7-H3 protein could be
both a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target.
The B7-H3 dependent effect on API-2- and
everolimus-sensitivity seems to be linked to the glycolytic
capacity of the cells. Thus, we observed decreased
glycolysis in the tumor cells treated with API-2 or
everolimus, in line with recent reports in other human
cancer cells, as well as with the connection between
AKT/mTOR/p70S6K signaling in cancer and glycolysis
[29, 30, 41]. Moreover, we found that B7-H3 increased the
glycolytic capacity of TNBC cells. These changes linked
to B7-H3 expression are not exclusive to breast cancer cell
lines as similar results were obtained with melanoma cell
lines (data not shown). The molecular basis of the link
between cell metabolism and drug resistance mediated
by B7-H3 needs to be explored. Interestingly, we have
previously found a correlation between B7-H3 expression
and STAT3 signaling, a protein that has emerged as a
master regulator also of glycolysis [42].
In summary, our results show that B7-H3 expression
confers resistance of breast cancer cells to anticancer
therapies. In addition, we have unveiled a role for B7-H3
in cell metabolism. Further identification of signaling
molecules/pathways and metabolic regulators influenced
by B7-H3 will be important in defining the role of B7-H3
in glycolysis, drug resistance and cancer metastasis.

DISCUSSION
B7-H3 is highly expressed in various breast cancer
cell lines and tumors, including in TNBC [18–22],
correlating with cancer progression and poor outcome.
In addition, B7-H3 expression has also been linked to
resistance to chemotherapeutic agents [17, 31]. Here,
we performed a compound screen using human TNBC
cell lines and found that cell responsiveness to API-2
(triciribidine) and everolimus (RAD-001), two inhibitors
targeting proteins in the AKT/mTOR pathway, was
increased under conditions with low B7-H3 expression.
We observed a weak, but significant increase in the
in vitro antiproliferative effect of API-2 and everolimus
in B7-H3 knockdown cells, as well as in anti-B7-H3
antibody treated cells. The effect of B7-H3 expression on
drug response was further strengthened by in vivo results
showing significantly reduced effect of everolimus on
B7-H3 overexpressing MDA-MB-231 xenografs.
To our knowledge, this is the first time that B7-H3
is linked to decreased sensitivity to targeted therapy with
small molecule inhibitors. Inhibitors of proteins in the
AKT/mTOR pathway, including everolimus, are currently
being tested in the clinic as new therapeutic agents in
breast cancer patients [32–34]. Our results suggest a link
between B7-H3 expression and sensitivity to API-2 and
everolimus inhibitors. In this regard, a recent report on
non-small cell lung cancer relates poor prognosis to the
up-regulation of B7-H3 by ILT-4 through PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway [35]. Our analysis on the phosphorylation
status on proteins from the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
indicates a differential effect on mTOR and the mTORdownstream target p70S6K. This suggests a different
B7-H3-mediated mechanism of API-2 and everolimus on
breast cancer cell sensitivity downstream of mTOR .
B7-H3 expression did not alter activation of the
AKT/mTOR pathway, but the high B7-H3 expression
levels in the tumor cells increased cell survival and
glycolysis (Supplementary Figure S3, left panel). B7-H3
expression was not altered by the presence of
API-2 or everolimus inhibitors, but their inhibitory effect
on both cell growth and glycolysis was dependent on
the endogenous expression levels of B7-H3. Inhibition
was enhanced by B7-H3 knockdown or antibody
targeting, while increased levels of B7-H3 counteracted
this inhibition (Supplementary Figure S3, right panel).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, plasmids, immunoblot, antibodies
and reagents
MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cell variants
were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, and
2 mM L-glutamine. The mammalian expression plasmid to

generate stable cell lines pCDNA6-B7-H3, was obtained
by subcloning from pIRES-B7-H3 cut with NheI/SacII
(NEB), and stable cell lines were selected with 10 μg/ml
Blasticidin (Gibco) for three weeks. Whole cell protein
extracts were prepared by total cell lysis and Western
blots were preformed as described previously in [19, 43].
Antibodies used were: B7-H3 (AF1027, R&D), tubulin
(CP06, Millipore), and pAKT (#4060), AKT (#9272),
pmTOR (#2971) and pp70S6K (#9206) (all from Cell
Signaling). B7-H3 monoclonal antibody (BRCA84D) was
kindly provided by MacroGenics. Protein concentrations
from total cell lysates was measured using The Pierce®
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA).
API-2 (Triciribidine, Sigma-Aldrich), and everolimus
(RAD-001, Sigma-Aldrich and Invivogen) were used
at different concentration, during the indicated times.
DMSO was always used as a control, at the same final
concentration as in resuspended and diluted drugs.
Western blot band intensities were quantified using
ImageJ software from two-three independent biological
experiments ± S.D.

In vitro proliferation and cell confluence assay

Drug screening

Four groups of 10 female Balb/c nude mice, bred
and used at the nude rodent facility at the Oslo University
Hospital, The Norwegian Radium Hospital. The animals
were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions,
and food and water were supplied ad libitum. Animal
experiments were done according to protocols approved
by the animal care and use committee and were in
compliance with the guidelines on animal welfare of the
Norwegian National Committee for Animal Experiments.
When the animals were 6 to 8 weeks of age, 2 × 106
cells in 0.2 mL PBS were injected s.c. in both flanks of
nude mice. For therapy experiments, a stock solution of
everolimus in DMSO (28 mM) was dissolved in 0.5 %
methylcellulose and when the mean tumor diameter was
between 5 to 6 mm 5 mg/kg of the drug was administered
by gavage three times a week for the first three weeks and
thereafter twice weekly. The control mice received only
the DMSO in 0.5 % methylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich).
Tumor diameters were measured 2–3 times per week.
Tumor volume was calculated by the formula 0.5 × length
× width2 and growth curves constructed, and the data is
presented as average tumor volume ± S.E.M.

Cells (1 × 104 cells) were plated in 96-well culture
plates in media with or without API-2 or everolimus and
incubated for indicated time points. Cell proliferation was
determined by CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay Kit (MTS, Promega Corp, Madison,
WI, USA). Cells were processed 72 h post-treatment.
Absorbance was measured at 490 nm using Wallac Victor2
1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer, USA). The data
is presented as the average absorbance ± S.D. corrected
for background from one representative experiment. Cell
proliferation assays were performed in at least triplicate
wells three times for each cell line at separate days. Cell
confluence was measured growing the cells in IncuCyte
FLR or IncuCyte ZOOM Kinetic Imaging System (Essen
BioScience) that estimate cell growth and number. Cells
were scanned every three-hour during the times indicated.
The data is presented as cell confluence ± S.D.

In vivo studies

The cell lines were screened for a library of
22 compounds (Supplementary Table S1). The compounds
were printed in seven dilutions (0.34 pM – 20 µM) with
two technical replicates using a Hamilton robot (Hamilton
Robotics Inc., Reno, NV, USA) in 384-well plates
(Corning Inc., NY, USA). The cell lines MDA-MB-435
(shSCR and shB7-H3) and MDA-MB-231 (shSCR and
shB7-H3) were seeded in 384-well plates using 500–900
cells per well. Cells in suspension were dispensed to each
well by a Multidrop Reagent dispenser Combi (Thermo
Fischer Scientific, USA). The screening was conducted for
five days, and cell viability was measured using CellTiterGlo® assay (CTG, Promega Corp, Madison, WI, USA)
where luminescence signal was read by a MicroBeta
TriLux (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The drug
screening was performed twice for each cell line variant,
and the reproducibility of the duplicate screens was
evaluated with respect to their correlation in a scatter plot
(Supplementary Figure S4). A high correlation, ranging
from 0.87–0.91, showed that the replicate screens were
similar and thus biologically representative. Cell viability
was converted into relative response using the average of
the lowest concentrations of all compounds as control. The
relative response was further corrected through compoundwise normalization to the average response of the three
lowest concentrations. Drug responses were plotted in
GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA, USA) and IC50 (half maximal inhibitory
concentration) values were obtained for compounds that
showed effect. The EC50 values of API-2 and everolimus in
the cell variants are presented in Supplementary Table S2.

Extracellular lactic acid levels and acidification
rate
Glycolysis Cell-Based Assay Kit (Cayman
chemicals) was used to measure extracellular L-lactic
acid levels according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cell
number was measured by crystal violet (0.05%) staining,
resuspended in 1% SDS. Luminescence was measured at
490 nm using Wallac 1420 (PerkinElmer, USA) with the
MicroBeta Windows Workstation (PerkinElmer, USA)

± S.D. XF96 Glycolysis stress test was performed using
Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer XF96e to measure
the ExtraCellular Acidification Rate (ECAR) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were seeded in Seahorse
plate 48 hours after splitting, and cultured overnight
to 80% confluence. One hour before measurement,
the culture medium was replaced with cellular assay
medium (Seahorse Bioscience) supplemented with
2 mM glutamine, and incubated for 1 hour in a CO2-free
incubator. And assay was performed according to Seahorse
protocols with the final concentrations of 10 mM glucose,
1 µM of oligomycin and 100 mM of 2-Deoxy-D-glucose
(2-DG). Seahorse assays were performed in at least
triplicate wells in three independent experiments for each
cell line and condition at separate days ± S.D.
