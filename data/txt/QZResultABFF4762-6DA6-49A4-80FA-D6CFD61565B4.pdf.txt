ABSTRACT
Less than a third of adults patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are
cured by current treatments, emphasizing the need for new approaches to therapy.
We previously demonstrated that besides playing a role in drug-resistant leukemia
cell lines, multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4/ABCC4) regulates leukemia cell
proliferation and differentiation through the endogenous MRP4/ABCC4 substrate,
cAMP. Here, we studied the role of MRP4/ABCC4 in tumor progression in a mouse
xenograft model and in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) differentiation. We found a
decrease in the mitotic index and an increase in the apoptotic index associated with
the inhibition of tumor growth when mice were treated with rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor)
and/or probenecid (MRPs inhibitor). Genetic silencing and pharmacologic inhibition
of MRP4 reduced tumor growth. Furthermore, MRP4 knockdown induced cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis in vivo. Interestingly, when LSC population was isolated, we
observed that increased cAMP levels and MRP4/ABCC4 blockade resulted in LSCs
differentiation. Taken together, our findings show that MRP4/ABCC4 has a relevant
role in tumor growth and apoptosis and in the eradication of LSCs, providing the basis
for a novel promising target in AML therapy.

INTRODUCTION

also known as members of the C-family of ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) drug transporters, was classically focused
on their role in cancer chemotherapy, particularly on their
ability to confer clinical drug resistance [4]. However,
the pathophysiological actions of these proteins are
quite diverse, and transport of cytotoxic xenobiotics as a
defense mechanism appears not to be the only important
evolutionarily conserved function. Moreover, while
several members of the ABC family are established
as drug transporters, others also mediate transport of
intracellular substances that have relevant functions in
cancer biology [5]. In particular, MRP4/ABCC4 is the
main transporter for cAMP, a relevant signaling molecule
that controls cellular proliferation, differentiation, and
apoptosis, especially in hematopoietic development [6-8].
Interestingly, MRP4/ABCC4 expression decreases during

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous
clonal disorder where early hematopoietic cells fail to
differentiate and do not undergo programmed cell death
or apoptosis. AML is most common in the elderly, but it
represents 15-20% of childhood acute leukemias [1]. In
the last decades, chemotherapy has been the treatment of
choice for AML but one of the major complications is that
the current drugs are highly toxic and poorly tolerated,
especially by older patients [2]. Furthermore, despite
the high-dose chemotherapy, only 20-30% of patients
with AML are cured, emphasizing the need for new
therapeutical approaches [3].

leukocyte differentiation, promoting cAMP accumulation
in differentiated cells [9]. In accordance, comparison of
different AML subtypes showed that the highest level of
MRP4/ABCC4 is expressed in the least differentiated
subtypes [10].
In recent years, emerging evidence suggests that
leukemic stem cells (LSCs) lie at the heart of posttreatment relapse and chemoresistance. Thus, the search
for effective LSC-directed therapy by targeting their
specific properties such as self-renewal, overexpressed
cell-surface proteins or aberrant differentiation is a critical
challenge [11]. In particular, the increasing recognition
that molecules involved in stem cell differentiation have
a key role in carcinogenesis prompts our investigation in
this direction. Previous studies have shown that various
ABC transporters are highly expressed in LSCs as part of
their self-protection capabilities [12].
In the last years our research has been focused on
the regulation of cAMP levels with potential implication
in the differentiation and/or cytotoxicity of hematopoietic
cancer cells. In this regard, we reported that MRP4/
ABCC4 regulates intracellular cAMP levels in AML
cell lines and contributes to cell proliferation and
differentiation [13]. Based on these findings, the aim of
the present work was to advance into the knowledge of

MRP4/ABCC4 as a potential new therapeutic target for
AML. For this purpose, we evaluated the role of this
transporter in tumor progression in a mouse xenograft
model and in the temporal resolution of cAMP response
in LSCs differentiation. Here, we show that MRP4/
ABCC4 blockade strongly reduced tumor growth inducing
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vivo. In addition, we
found that increased cAMP levels and MRP4/ABCC4
inhibition resulted in LSCs differentiation. Altogether,
these findings show that MRP4/ABCC4 has a relevant
role in tumor growth and apoptosis and in the eradication
of LSCs, providing the basis for a novel promising target
in leukemia therapy.

PDE4 and MRP inhibition significantly decreases cell
proliferation in diverse AML cell lines [13]. Thus, to
evaluate the effect of cAMP regulation on leukemia cell
proliferation in vivo, a human AML model was established
by subcutaneously injecting Swiss nu/nu mice with U937
cells. When tumors were palpable, mice were treated
with intraperitoneal injections of probenecid (MRP
inhibitor, 50 mg/kg), rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor, 1.5 mg/
kg), probenecid+rolipram or with vehicle 5 times per week
for 2 weeks. Tumors were measured 3 times per week and
volumes calculated. Interestingly, all treatments showed
inhibition of tumor growth, a significant smaller tumor
volume was achieved in probenecid and/or rolipramtreated animals as compared with vehicle-treated mice
after 2 weeks (P<0.01; Figure 1A-B).
Next, the tumor morphology was evaluated in H&Estained sections, with emphasis on tissue organization as
a whole (evaluated at low magnification), the presence
of neo-vascularization (new, heterogeneous, one layer
endothelial vessels), the cytological characteristics

of tumor cells, mitosis and apoptosis. Control tumors
exhibited a solid monomorphic sheet with no necrotic or
hemorrhagic areas, while treated tumors showed variable
necrotic areas (Figure 2A). A significant decrease in the
mitotic index was observed in mice treated with rolipram,
probenecid, and rolipram with probenecid. Moreover, the
latter treatment was even more effective in decreasing
the number of mitosis compared with mice treated with
rolipram or probenecid alone (Figure 2B). In addition, as
shown in Figure 2C, a significant increase in the apoptotic
index was observed in mice treated with all compounds.
Hence, the mitotic and apoptotic indexes correlated with
the effect of PDE4 and/or MRPs inhibition on tumor
growth.

MRP4 knockdown decreases tumor growth in vivo
As MRP4 is the main transporter for cAMP and
this signaling molecule has important implications in

hematopoietic cell proliferation we aimed to evaluate
whether MRP4 played a role in vivo in AML tumor
growth. Nude mice were injected with U937 cells
expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against MRP4
(MRP4-shRNA) or scrambled, used as a control. The
generation and characterization of these cells with
stable MRP4-knockdown has been previously reported
by us [13] and tested by western blot and cAMP assay
just before mice injection (Supplementary Figure 1).
In order to compare this molecular approach with the
most effective pharmacological treatment (Figure 2), a
third group of mice carrying U937-scramble tumor was
treated with both rolipram and probenecid (1.5 mg/kg and
50 mg/kg, respectively) 5 times per week for 2 weeks.

Remarkably, silencing of MRP4 strongly reduced tumor
growth likewise the pharmacological treatment (Figure
3A-B).
To provide further evidence that MRP4 knockdown
was effective in vivo, following 2 weeks MRP4
expression was assessed by western blot in scramble,
rolipram+probenecid and MRP4-shRNA tumors. As
expected, a significant reduction in MRP4 protein levels
was observed in MRP4-shRNA tumors as compared with
scramble tumors. However, MRP4 expression was similar
in rolipram+probenecid and scramble tumors, although
we have previously reported that rolipram and probenecid
increase intracellular cAMP levels [13], (Figure 3C).

MRP4 knockdown decreases the mitotic index

dramatic up-regulation in both groups (Figure 4D).
Collectively, these results indicate that MRP4 blockade
or rolipram+probenecid treatment, triggers cytostasis by
inducing G1 phase arrest.

After two weeks, tumors were excised and their
morphology evaluated in H&E-stained sections. MRP4shRNA tumors developed vast necrotic areas, and
evident neo-vascularization; no significant histological
differences were observed between this group and
the rolipram+probenecid-treated mice (Figure 4A).
Furthermore, tumors from MRP4-shRNA mice showed
a significant decreased mitotic index as compared with
control mice, although no differences were observed with
mice treated with both rolipram and probenecid (Figure
4B).
Next, we assessed in vivo the effect of
silencing MRP4 or inhibiting MRPs and PDE4 on the
expression of key regulators of G1 phase progression
including cyclinD1 and p21Waf1/Cip1. As shown in
Figure 4C, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed a
decreased cyclin D1 expression in MRP4-shRNA and
rolipram+probenecid tumors compared with the scramble
shRNA. In accordance, the levels of p21 exhibited a

MRP4 knockdown induces apoptosis in vivo
Cyclic AMP plays a central role in several cellular
processes like proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis
[6,8]. The human U937 promonocytic leukemia cell line
can be forced to differentiate into monocytes under the
appropriate treatment [14]. In a previous paper, we reported
that MRP pharmacological inhibition as well as specific
MRP4 knockdown induced U937 cell differentiation by
increasing cAMP intracellular levels [13]. Therefore,
in the present study we evaluated cell differentiation in
tumors from mice treated with rolipram and probenecid
and with MRP4-shRNA. No significant differences
were observed on the expression of the differentiation
markers CD11b, CD14, CD88 (data not shown). As
cAMP-elevating agents may trigger differentiation and/
or apoptosis, we next quantified apoptosis by TUNEL
staining. Figure 5A depicts a complete field for tumors

MRP4 is expressed in isolated LSCs

from scramble, rolipram+probenecid and MRP4-shRNA
groups. In both cases, the number of apoptotic cells was
significantly higher than in the scramble shRNA control
group (Figure 5A, right graph).
Caspase-3 is a very important regulator of apoptosis
in response to a variety of stimuli. In accordance with
TUNEL results, the inhibition of MRP and PDE4 as
well as MRP4 specific knockdown, induced caspase-3
cleavage-mediated activation (Figure 5B). In line
with these findings, an increased expression of Bax, a
proapoptotic protein, was detected in the MRP4-shRNA
and rolipram+probenecid tumors. However, while MRP4
knockdown tumors presented a uniform staining, the
rolipram+probenecid group exhibited heterogeneous
stained sections. This difference observed in Bax
expression correlates well with the different approaches
used to inhibit MRP4 (Figure 5C).
Taken together, these findings show that both
pharmacological treatment and MRP4 knockdown induce
apoptosis but not cell differentiation in tumors in vivo.

Results so far indicate that MRP4 is involved in
tumor growth and apoptosis, suggesting that MRP4
might be a new target for AML treatment. Based on these
observations and the increasing recognition that relapse of
AML reflects the failure of current therapies to effectively
target leukemic stem cells (LSCs), we aimed to isolate
LSCs in the U937 AML cell line. However, in these cells
the LSC population was less than 0.1%, supporting that
the U937 cell line is not a good model to study LSCs (data
not shown). It was recently reported that KG-1a, a human
undifferentiated AML cell line, is a suitable cellular model
to study LSCs [15]. Therefore, in order to confirm the
presence and percentage of LSCs (CD34+CD38-) in the
KG-1a cell line, cells were stained with a combination of
CD34-PE and CD38-PECy5 antibodies and then analyzed
by flow cytometry. Results showed that KG-1a cells
contained more than 70% of CD34+CD38- cells (Figure
6A, left panel). Then, CD34+CD38- and CD34+CD38+
populations (LSCs and non-LSCs, respectively) were
sorted from the cell line using FACS. Post-sorting cell
purity revealed that the LSCs-sorted population was
99% pure (Figure 6A, right panel). Four sortings were

performed and the percentage of LSCs was always higher
than non-LSCs (68±9% vs 26±5%; p<0.01) (Figure
6B). To further characterize the CD34+CD38- sorted
population, cells were stained with CD123 antibody given
that CD123 (IL-3 receptor α chain) is a unique marker
for human AML stem cells [16]. As shown in Figure 6C,
a high percentage of the CD34+CD38- sorted population
expressed CD123.
AML stem cells have been shown to express
various ABC transporters conferring resistance to a broad
spectrum of chemotherapeutic drugs [12]. In order to
validate MRP4/ABCC4 as a new target for the eradication
of LSCs, we assessed the presence of this transporter in
the sorted populations. MRP4/ABCC4 protein expression
in the CD34+CD38- population was shown by flow
cytometry (Figure 6D).

proliferation rate was observed in CD34+CD38- cells
cultured in IMDM compared to the cells in GBGM, a
medium developed for the culture of hematopoietic stem
cells[17] . However, after 7 days in culture in IMDM,
CD34+CD38- cells tended to differentiate into the
CD34+CD38+ population, while in GBGM they retained
their undifferentiated phenotype (Supplementary Figure 2).
Subsequently, we employed GBGM to determine the effect
of cAMP modulators and/or MRP4/ABCC4 inhibitor, on
CD34+CD38- cells using non-cytotoxic concentrations
of the compounds. LSCs differentiation was assessed by
CD38 and CD11b expression in the presence of 10 μM
forskolin (FK; direct adenylyl cyclase activator), 50 μM
MK-571 (MK; MRP4/ABCC4 inhibitor), either alone or
in combination, for 48 h. As shown in Figure 7A, FK or
MK induced CD38 expression. Moreover, co-incubation
with both agents yielded significantly higher levels of this
marker.
To gain more insight into LSCs differentiation, the
myelomonocytic lineage marker CD11b was evaluated.
Neither FK nor MK alone induced expression of this
differentiation marker in the LSC population. However,
cells treated with both FK and MK enhanced CD11b
surface expression (Figure 7B).
Present findings indicate that MRP4/ABCC4 might
be a new target for LSCs eradication in AML by inducing
their differentiation.

Since MRP4/ABCC4 is involved in the regulation
of cAMP levels, which are critical for leukemic cell
differentiation, we further analyzed its role in LSCs
differentiation. First, in order to maintain the LSC
population undifferentiated in culture we determined
the optimal culture conditions. A marked increase in

DISCUSSION

patients with AML and higher levels of this protein were
detected in the less differentiated FAB subtypes M0 and
M1; however, its expression has no influence on treatment
outcome using AraC [9,10]. Recently, frequent copy
number alterations of MRP4/ABCC4 were observed in
de novo AML and variable expression of this transporter
was detected among AML subtypes from 155 pediatric
patients [23]. In addition to cancer, this transporter appears
to be involved in the development and progression of
pulmonary arterial hypertension, a severe vascular disease
[24]. Thus, this transporter has recently emerged as a new
promising target for these pathologies.
MRP4/ABCC4 has specificity for a wide range
of endogenous substrates. It is the major cAMP efflux
transporter, a cyclic nucleotide involved in the regulation
of cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis
[25,26]. Indeed, previously we demonstrated that besides
playing a role in drug-resistant leukemia cell lines,
MRP4/ABCC4 regulates leukemia cell proliferation
and differentiation through the endogenous MRP4/
ABCC4 substrate, cAMP [13]. Unlike other ABC family

The study of ABC transporters was classically
focused on their role in cancer chemotherapy, particularly
on their ability to confer resistance to a wide range of
chemotherapeutic agents [4]. However, while several
members of the ABC family are established as drug
transporters, others also mediate transport of endogenous
substances that have relevant functions in cancer biology
[5]. A number of clinical studies have correlated ABC
transporter levels with malignant progression and a more
aggressive phenotype. In particular, current evidences
suggest that MRP4/ABCC4 is implicated not only in
chemotherapy resistance, but also in cancer biology.
In this respect, recent studies have shown that MRP4/
ABCC4 is overexpressed in several solid tumors such as
prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, aggressive
primary neuroblastoma, and pancreatic cancer [18-22].
Increased MRP4/ABCC4 levels have been significantly
associated with poor clinical outcome in neuroblastoma. It
has been reported that MRP4 is expressed in blast cells of

members, little is known about this transporter and its role
in leukemia progression, independent of its drug efflux
properties. To our knowledge, present findings provide
for the first time strong evidence that MRP4/ABCC4 is
involved in tumor growth, differentiation and/or apoptosis
in AML.
Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are crucial in
leukemia initiation, progression, metastasis and relapse.
Therapeutic approaches targeting mature leukemic cells
may clinically improve the disease, although they are
unlikely curative if LSCs are not targeted or are resistant
to the therapy. Hence, new treatments should be tested on
this population. Tumors are the primary source for cancer
stem cells (CSCs), although cancer cell lines are attractive
alternative sources given that they are not contaminated
with normal stem cells [27]. On the other hand, stem cells
in tissues are usually in a very small number, which makes
it rather difficult to identify and further to isolate them.
In this study we detected LSCs (CD34+CD38-) in the
undifferentiated AML cell line KG-1a and revealed that
they represent approximately 70% of the cell population,
whereas in other AML cell lines they are less than 1% and
in AML patients around 0.01% to 0.09% [11,28]. Previous
studies reported that LSCs isolated from the KG-1a cell
line have LSC-specific features, including self-renewal
capacity [15]. In accordance, the present study showed that
the CD34+CD38- sorted population expresses CD123, a
stem cell-specific marker in AML. These findings support
that the KG-1a cell line is a suitable model to isolate and
study LSCs.
The high expression of ABC transporters involved
in the extrusion of chemotherapeutic compounds was
proposed to be a major mechanism of drug resistance in
LSCs [12]. Interestingly, when different AML subtypes
were compared, the least differentiated subtypes expressed
the highest level of MRP4/ABCC4 [10]. Moreover,
mRNA of this transporter was previously detected in LSCs
from untreated AML patients [12]. We found that MRP4/
ABCC4 is expressed at protein level in the CD34+CD38KG-1a sorted population. Incomplete eradication of LSCs
is likely to result in disease relapse and one approach to
interfere with LSCs is to force them into differentiation.
An example of the effectiveness of differentiating agents
to eliminate CSCs is all-trans-retinoic acid that has been
successfully used in promyelocytic AML3 subtype [29].
In addition, factors that increase cAMP levels augment
the ability of this therapy to induce differentiation in
blast cells [30]. Here, we evaluated differentiation in
the LSC population by measuring the expression of the
differentiation-specific antigens CD38 and CD11b. It is
well known that the KG1a cell line fails to respond to
several differentiating agents including phorbol esters,
but in the present study when cAMP production was
stimulated by forskolin, MRP4/ABCC4 inhibition induced
CD38 expression and significantly enhanced CD11b
surface expression. To our knowledge, this is the first
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

study linking MRP4/ABCC4 to cell differentiation in a
LSC population.
Furthermore, we showed in vivo that the
administration of rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor) with
probenecid (MRP inhibitor) decreased tumor growth,
which induced cytostasis and apoptosis. Consistent with
this pharmacological approach, similar results were
obtained when MRP4 was silenced by shRNA. These
findings bring up the question why the in vivo MRP4/
ABCC4 inhibition caused cell death if there are living
cells that express no MRP4/ABCC4. However, in analogy,
it was shown that although most cells do not express
Bcr-Abl, its blockade induces apoptosis in Bcr-Abl
addicted leukemias. Thus, Bcr-Abl expression causes the
accumulation of pro-apoptotic signals that are released by
Bcr-Abl inhibition [31,32]. Similarly, in the present study
MRP4/ABCC4 blockade increased cAMP levels resulting
in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
The signaling pathway mediated by cAMP has
emerged as a key regulator of blood cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis in malignant cell populations
[33]. While cAMP induces monocytic differentiation of
HL-60 cells it triggers apoptosis in normal and leukemic
thymocytes and in the myeloid leukemia cell line IPC-81
[6,34]. Thus, the relative balance between growth arrest,
apoptosis and differentiation apparently depends on cAMP
levels and the cellular context. Besides, differentiation
and apoptosis can be triggered either independently or
combined. We previously reported that increased cAMP
levels induce differentiation in AML cell lines [13]. In
the present work we show that cyclic nucleotide elevation
also favored differentiation in LSCs, although it enhanced
apoptosis in vivo. The distinct biological responses may
be attributable to the different experimental models used
in this study, in vitro versus in vivo. Furthermore, the
fact that apoptosis could have been preceded by early
differentiation in mice cannot be excluded.
The present study provides direct evidence in
vivo and in vitro that MRP4/ABCC4 is involved in the
regulation of LSCs differentiation as well as in tumor
growth and apoptosis. In addition, clinical studies
showed that MRP4/ABCC4 is highly expressed in blast
cells of childhood and adult AML and higher levels
of this transporter were observed in less differentiated
AML subtypes [10,35]. Thus, our study, supported by
these previous reports using patient samples, contributes
to validate MRP4/ABCC4 as a new target for AML
treatment.
Just recently, a considerable body of evidence
indicates that MRP4/ABCC4 is implicated in the
development of cancer, supporting its role as a novel
therapeutic target [5,36]. Thus, MRP4/ABCC4 inhibition
should be considered as a new alternative strategy for
cancer treatment, either alone or in combination with
chemotherapeutic drugs. To date, no pharmacological
inhibitors have been identified that exclusively target

MRP4/ABCC4. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of this
transporter will require the design of potent and specific
novel compounds than those available. On the other hand,
a promising emerging technology to inhibit MRP4/ABCC4
is gene silencing using small interfering RNAs, including
shRNA [37]. At the present time, for efficient delivery and
stable knockdown of target genes in hematopoietic cells,
retroviral vectors are an attractive tool [38]. In our study, a
retroviral vector for MRP4/ABCC4 stable knockdown was
successfully used. However, further studies are necessary
to examine delivery conditions, biosafety and clinical
applicability of shRNA as a biomedical tool in leukemia
treatment.

days with rolipram (R, phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor,
1.5 mg/kg), probenecid (P, MRP inhibitor, 50 mg/kg),
rolipram+probenecid (R+P) or with vehicle (control,
DMSO, 0.15 ml/kg) for 16 days.

Molecular approach

Six-week-old female nude (nu/nu, University of La
Plata Animal Facility) mice were used. All animal care and
experimental procedures complied with the Institutional
guidelines and the United Kingdom Coordinating
Committee on Cancer Research Guidelines for the Welfare
of Animals in Experimental Neoplasia [39,40].

This experiment was performed with U937 cells
expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against MRP4
(U937-shMRP4) or scrambled shRNA (U937-scramble) as
previously reported [13]. Swiss nu/nu mice were injected
with 10 x106 cells of U937-shMRP4 or U937-scramble.
A third group of mice carrying U937-scramble tumor was
treated every 2 days with rolipram+probenecid (R+P, 1.5
mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, respectively) for 13 days.
In both experiments, tumors were measured using a
Vernier Caliper and tumor volumes were calculated with
the formula 4 x 3-1 x π x minor radius2 x major radius [41].
At the end of the experiments, animals were euthanized,
and tumor samples removed and frozen at -80ºC for
western blots or formalin-fixed for immunohistochemistry
studies.

Cell culture, sorting and cell differentiation

Morphological studies

Human U937 and KG-1a leukemia cells were
cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2
in RPMI 1640 or IMDM, respectively, containing 10%
FCS (Invitrogen).
Fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) was
performed using standard protocols. Briefly, cells were
incubated with mouse anti-human CD34-PE and mouse
anti-human CD38-PECy5 (Beckman Coulter) for 30 min
at 4°C, washed twice in PBS, analyzed and sorted using
an Epics Altra Cell Sorter Flow Cytometer (Beckman
Coulter). Gating on forward and side light scatter was used
to exclude dead cells and debris.
In order to evaluate differentiation of the LSC
population, after sorting CD34+CD38- cells were cultured
in GBGM (Clear Cell Technologies) 10% FCS and treated
with 10 µM forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 µM MK571 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 48 h.

The morphological features of both tumor
parenchyma (cellular type, grade of differentiation and
growth pattern) and stroma (blood vessels, fibrosis and
inflammatory infiltrate) were evaluated in hematoxylineosin (H&E) stained slides. Mitosis and apoptosis were
counted in a 5 μ H&E stained sections by direct evaluation
of 10 and 15 high power fields (HPF), respectively, using
600 x magnification, and expressed as the mean ± SEM
of the percentage of the ratios between the total number
of events (mitosis or apoptosis) and the total cell number
per HPF. Mitotic figures were identified morphologically
by the condensed ‘‘hairy’’ aspect of the chromosomes.
Apoptosis was evaluated by identifying an eosinophilic
cytoplasm, cell shrinkage with condensation, peripheral
clumping or fragmentation of nuclear chromatin and by
the presence of apoptotic bodies [42]. In selected tumor
sections apoptosis was determined by TUNEL [terminal
deoxynucleotidyltransferasa (TdT)-mediated dUTP biotin
nick end labeling-technique] following manufacturer’s
instructions (Apoptag® peroxidase in situ apoptosis
detection kit, Merck Millipore, MA).

Biotechnology, CA) or Bax (1:50 Santa Cruz) antibodies
using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique
(Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, CA). The
reactions were developed with 3-3’diaminobenzidine
(DAB) as described [43]. After immunohistochemistry,
the specimens were lightly counterstained with 10%
hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted.

The characterization of the LSC population
and its differentiation was evaluated by direct
immunofluorescence staining using different combination
of the following monoclonal antibodies: CD34-FITC,
CD34-PE, CD38-PECy5, CD123-PE, CD11b-PE
(Beckman Coulter). Mouse IgG antibodies were used as
isotype controls.
MRP4/ABCC4 protein expression was detected by
indirect immunofluorescence staining using the affinity
purify polyclonal anti-human MRP4 antibody (1/50) [46].
The secondary antibody used in 1/200 dilution was goat
anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488 (Invitrogen). Incubations with
antibodies were performed in PBS 2% FCS for 45 min
at 4°C. Cells were washed twice with PBS 4% FCS and
resuspended in PBS. Incubation without MRP4 antibody
was performed as a negative control.
Data were acquired using a CyAn ADP Flow
Cytometer (DakoCytomation, Beckman Coulter) and
analysed using FlowJo software (Treestar).

Isolation of membrane vesicles from U937 cell line
According to El-Sheikh et al [44], cells were
harvested by centrifugation and the pellets resuspended
in ice-cold homogenization buffer [0.5 mM sodium
phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4] supplemented with
protease inhibitors and shaken at 4°C for 60 min. Lysed
cells were centrifuged at 4°C at 100.000g for 30 min, and
the pellets were homogenized in ice-cold TS buffer [10
mM Tris-HEPES and 250 mM sucrose, pH 7.4] using a
tight fitting Dounce homogenizer for 30 strokes. After
centrifugation at 500g at 4°C for 20 min, the supernatant
was centrifuged 4°C at 100.000g for 60 min. The resulting
pellet was resuspended in TS buffer and passed through a
27-gauge needle 30 times. Aliquots of crude membrane
vesicles were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C
until assayed. Protein concentration was determined by a
Bio-Rad protein assay kit following the manufacturer’s
instructions.

cAMP assay
Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium at a
density of 1 x 106 cells/ml and exposed to 25 µM forskolin
and 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine at different time
points as indicated in the corresponding figure legend.
Following centrifugation for 3 min at 3000 g at 4°C, 1 ml
ethanol was added to supernantants (extracellular cAMP)
and pellets (intracellular cAMP). Ethanol was dried and
residues resuspended in 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1%
BSA for further cAMP determination. Cyclic AMP content
was determined by competitive radio-binding assay for
PKA using [3H]cAMP, as previously described [47].
The standard curve was performed using eight cAMP
concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 90 pmol. Duplicate
samples in at least three independent experiments were
analyzed.

Western Blot Assay
Isolated tumors were homogenized with a polytron
to obtain total fractions for Western Blot as previously
described [45]. Similar amounts of protein extracts,
as determined by Lowry, were loaded into each lane,
separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes. The residual binding sites
were blocked with 5% non-fat powdered milk in PBS
containing 0.05% Tween 20, and membranes were
incubated in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 with
antibodies to p21 (1:300), Caspase-3 (1:1500) (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), MRP4 (1/50, Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and α-tubulin (1:5000,
Cell signaling Technology, Beverly, CA) overnight at 4
ºC. All subsequent washes were performed with the same
buffer. Reactivity was developed using an anti-rabbit or
anti-mouse polyclonal antibody linked to horseradish
peroxidase (Vector) and developed by enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) following the manufacturer’s
instructions (Amersham, GE Healthcare Lifesciences,
Pittsburgh, PA).

Statistical analysis
Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism
5.0 via an unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s comparison test.
Differences were considered to be significant at p<0.05.
