Abstract
Tumor hypoxia is known to activate angiogenesis, anaerobic glycolysis, invasion, and metastasis. However, a
comparative analysis of the potentially distinct functions of hypoxia in primary tumor growth and organspecific metastasis has not been reported. Here, we show distinct hypoxia kinetics in tumors generated by
the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer sublines with characteristically different primary tumor growth rates and organotropic metastasis potentials. Hypoxia-induced angiogenesis promotes both primary tumor growth and
lung metastasis but is nonessential for bone metastasis. Microarray profiling revealed that hypoxia enhances
the expression of a significant number of genes in the lung metastasis signature, but only activates a few bone
metastasis genes, among which DUSP1 was functionally validated in this study. Despite the different mechanisms by which hypoxia promotes organ-specific metastasis, inhibition of HIF-1α with a dominant-negative
form of HIF-1α or 2-methoxyestradiol reduced metastasis to both lung and bone. Consistent with the extensive functional overlap of hypoxia in promoting primary tumor growth and lung metastasis, a 45-gene hypoxia
response signature efficiently stratifies breast cancer patients with low or high risks of lung metastasis, but not
for bone metastasis. Our study shows distinct functions of hypoxia in regulating angiogenesis and metastasis
in different organ microenvironments and establishes HIF-1α as a promising target for controlling organotropic metastasis of breast cancer. Cancer Res; 70(10); 3905–14. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Metastasis to vital organs such as bone, lung, liver, and
brain is responsible for the vast majority of breast cancer
deaths (1). It has been well recognized that metastatic seeding and growth is determined by both the intrinsic genetic
properties of tumor cells and the local characteristics of
the stromal microenvironment (1, 2). Functional genomic
analyses of the in vivo selected organotropic variants of
breast cancer cell lines have led to the identification of distinct sets of organ-specific metastasis genes to bone, lung,
and brain (3–5). Understanding the organ-specific functions

of metastasis-related signaling pathways may provide new
opportunities for therapeutically targeting metastasis in different organs.
Hypoxia has been increasingly recognized to play a central
role in different stages of tumor progression (6). Signaling
responses to hypoxia are mediated mainly through the
hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), including HIF-1, HIF-2, and
HIF-3 (7). Among them, HIF-1 is best characterized as being
responsible for the regulation of many hypoxia-inducible
genes. HIF-1 is composed of the hypoxia-responsive subunit,
HIF-1α, and the constitutively expressed subunit, HIF-1β.
Under normoxia, the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD)
domain of HIF-1α is hydroxylated, facilitating the binding
of the von Hippel-Lindau E3 ubiquitin ligase and subsequent
proteosome-mediated degradation of HIF-1α. When oxygen
levels become limited, HIF-1α is free of hydroxylation and
escapes degradation. Accumulated HIF-1α enters the nucleus, forms a transcription complex with HIF-1β, and drives
transcription of downstream genes (8).
HIF-1α overexpression is correlated with distant metastasis
and poor prognosis for breast cancer patients (9). Furthermore, HIF-1α overexpression was more frequently observed
in metastases than in primary tumor of breast cancer, suggesting an active role of HIF-1α in regulating metastatic progression (9). The functions of hypoxia and HIF-1α in promoting
metastasis may overlap with its functions in primary tumor
growth, for example, the enhancement of angiogenesis. However, hypoxia is also known to promote metastasis-specific
functions, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastatic seeding (10). The distinct functions of

hypoxia in promoting metastasis to different organs have not
been thoroughly investigated. Here, we integrate in vivo hypoxia imaging, functional inactivation of HIF-1α, and transcriptomic analysis to investigate the distinct functions of hypoxia
in tumor growth and metastasis in the recently developed
organotropic metastasis models of breast cancer.

microarray samples with metastasis information were obtained from Minn and colleagues (4). Hierarchical clustering
was performed using the GeneSpring GX 7.3 software (Agilent Technologies).

Results
Organotropic MDA-MB-231 variants SCP2 and LM2
display differential HIF-1α hypoxic response pattern in vitro
and in vivo. MDA-MB-231 sublines with distinct metastasis
organotropisms were previously isolated by in vivo selection
in xenograft metastasis models in mice (3, 4, 16). We chose to
use the bone-tropic subline SCP2 and the lung-tropic subline
LM2 to perform our study because of their distinctive proclivities to metastasize to different target organs: Following
intracardiac injection, SCP2 forms osteolytic bone lesions
much more efficiently than LM2, whereas following i.v. injection, LM2 generates numerous lung metastasis nodules but
SCP2 rarely forms any (Fig. 1A; ref. 11). SCP2 and LM2 have
similar growth rates in vitro (11). Interestingly, SCP2 and
LM2 display significant differences in primary tumor growth
when injected into mammary fat pads. Although LM2 forms
rapidly growing and well-vascularized primary tumors, SCP2
gives rise to tumors of much smaller size (Fig. 1B). The distinct growth and metastatic properties of the two cell lines
that share a closely related genetic background allow us to
comparatively investigate the potential organ-specific contribution of hypoxia to the growth of primary tumor and metastases in different organs.
First, we evaluated the hypoxic response of SCP2 and LM2
in vitro. HIF-1α protein was not detectable by immunoblotting in either subline under ambient oxygen conditions
(∼21%), but became highly abundant under low-oxygen conditions (1%; Fig. 1C). LM2 showed a noticeably stronger
response to hypoxia in vitro. To investigate the status of hypoxia and HIF-1α in tumor tissues, we detected hypoxia with
Hypoxyprobe (Supplementary Fig. S1) and performed IHC of
HIF-1α on primary tumors formed by LM2 and SCP2, lung
metastasis formed by LM2, and bone metastasis formed by
SCP2 (Fig. 1D). All tumor samples were harvested at the end
of the in vivo experiments shown in Fig. 1A and B. Hypoxia
was detected in primary tumors and metastases formed by
both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting hypoxia as
the cause for in vivo HIF-1α activation, although we cannot
rule out the influence of other signaling pathways on the
HIF-1α level. In primary tumors, HIF-1α was positively
stained in cell nuclei for both LM2 and SCP2 tumors with
an appreciably stronger staining in SCP2 tumors (Fig. 1D,
top). Considering the intrinsically weaker HIF-1α response

www.aacrjournals.org

in SCP2 in vitro (Fig. 1C), the more intense HIF-1α staining
of SCP2 tumors suggested that these tumors experienced
more hypoxia stress. Consistently, bone metastases formed
by SCP2 have a stronger HIF-1α staining than lung metastases formed by LM2 (Fig. 1D, bottom). It was also noted that
LM2 lung metastases contained prominent intratumoral
blood vessels whereas SCP2 bone metastases contained
very few.
SCP2 and LM2 display different intracellular hypoxia
kinetics during primary tumor growth. HIF-1α immunostaining only shows tumor cell responses to the hypoxia condition at a static time point. To analyze dynamic changes in
the hypoxia response by tumor cells longitudinally in vivo,
we adopted a recently developed approach of real-time of
HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylase activity using the reporter construct ODD-Fluc (17). When the ODD peptide is fused with
firefly luciferase (Fluc), the stability of ODD-Fluc fusion
protein mimics that of HIF-1α and serves as an accurate
reporter of the intracellular HIF-1α level and an indirect
reflection of hypoxia activity (17). Unlabeled SCP2 and LM2
were stably transfected with either a constitutively expressed
Fluc reporter or the ODD-Fluc reporter. To test the sensitivity of the reporter in detecting hypoxia response in vivo, we
used the hypoxia mimetic CoCl2 to create acute hypoxia-like
conditions in tumors. We first detected dose-dependent and
time-dependent stabilization of HIF-1α, as well as a dosedependent increase of ODD-Fluc activity, by CoCl2 treatment
in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S2). Next, we determined the
efficacy of the reporter system in vivo by treating mammary
tumor–bearing mice with a single dose of CoCl2. Tracking
the Fluc activity with BLI after the injection showed peak
luciferase signals at 20 hours posttreatment for ODD-Fluc
sublines, indicating response kinetics similar to the in vitro
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3). As a negative control,
the Fluc-labeled sublines showed little fluctuation of BLI signals after CoCl2 treatment.
After validating the ODD-Fluc hypoxia reporter system
in vivo, we characterized the dynamic changes of hypoxia
activity during the primary tumor development of SCP2
and LM2. To quantify the unit cellular response to hypoxia,
the ODD-Fluc sublines were further labeled with a constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase (Rluc; ref. 11). Previous
work has shown no cross-reactivity of Rluc and Fluc to their
noncorresponding substrates, D-luciferin and coelenterazine
(14). The dual-luciferase imaging system allowed direct comparison of relative hypoxia activity of tumors with different
sizes by normalizing Fluc (absolute hypoxia signaling
strength) to Rluc (tumor size). When Fluc/Rluc ratio was plotted at different time points after tumor inoculation, distinct
hypoxia response kinetics of SCP2 and LM2 were observed
(Fig. 2A). At the early phase of tumor growth (day 18), LM2
cells experienced higher hypoxia stress as LM2 showed greater
normalized Fluc signal than SCP2. However, at later time
points (day 34 and 41), a more hypoxic environment was
detected in SCP2 tumors than in LM2 tumors. This result is
consistent with the end point HIF-1α IHC analysis (Fig. 1D).
Both groups of primary tumors harvested at the end of the
experiment contained necrotic centers as revealed by H&E

staining (Fig. 2B). However, LM2 tumors showed a much
thicker growth zone than SCP2 tumors, suggesting the ability
of LM2 tumors to sustain continuous growth. This was
confirmed by Ki67 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) stainings (Fig. 2C).
LM2 tumors contained significantly more Ki67- positive nuclei
than SCP2 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4). Neither of the
tumors showed significant levels of apoptosis in the nonnecrotic regions. Taken together, these results suggested that
LM2 cells possess an overall proliferation advantage over
SCP2 cells in primary tumors. In general, continuous tumor
growth is dependent on adequate oxygen and nutrient supply
provided through blood circulation. Therefore, we determined
whether intratumoral blood vessel density was different in the
two tumors. Both CD31 IHC and in vivo dextran labeling
showed that vessels in LM2 tumors were more abundant
and with larger inclusion areas, whereas those in SCP2 tumors
were fewer and narrower (Fig. 2D). Because functional tumor
angiogenesis is largely triggered by hypoxia stress, and hypoxia
level, in turn, is alleviated by the successful formation of

neovasculature, the hypoxia kinetics observed in SCP2 and
LM2 primary tumors may reflect the stronger angiogenic
response of LM2 cells to hypoxia.
Differential dynamics of hypoxia in organ-specific
metastases of SCP2 and LM2. To investigate the potential
differences in hypoxic activities in organotropic metastasis,
SCP2 and LM2 cells harboring the dual-reporter system were
subjected to in vivo bone and lung metastasis assays. During
the progression of bone metastasis, we observed that the
trends of normalized Fluc activity in SCP2 and LM2 were
quite similar to those in the primary tumors: the Fluc/Rluc
signal ratio decreased continuously in LM2 bone metastasis
compared with a sustained high level of hypoxia in SCP2
bone metastasis (Fig. 3A). Again, the difference of the
hypoxia reporter activity at the end of the experiment was
consistent with the end point HIF-1α IHC analysis (Fig. 1D).
Because SCP2 failed to generate any detectable lung metastasis signal, we could only analyze the hypoxia activity kinetics
for LM2 lung metastasis. The normalized Fluc curve also
showed a continuous decrease (Fig. 3B).

Because the trends of hypoxia kinetics were consistent
between metastases and primary tumors formed by LM2
and SCP2, we hypothesized that the different angiogenic
properties of the two cell lines might also explain the different hypoxic dynamics seen in metastases. Indeed, CD31
staining showed very few blood vessels in SCP2 bone metastases, whereas LM2 bone metastases, although much less frequent, possessed rich pools of vasculature (Fig. 3C). Similarly,
LM2 cells recruited conspicuous blood vessels when forming
lung metastases (Fig. 3D). SCP2 did not generate any appreciable tumor mass in the lung to allow for a similar analysis.
It is unclear how SCP2 was able to generate fast-growing
osteolytic bone metastases without necrosis despite the lack
of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. The relatively small size of
bone metastases and the unique characteristics of the bone
microenvironment may allow SCP2 tumors to sustain growth
and avoid necrosis despite the lack of productive angiogenesis. Nonetheless, HIF-1α accumulation in SCP2 may have
angiogenesis-independent functions in promoting bone metastasis. Likewise, hypoxia response in LM2 may have lung
metastasis–promoting functions beyond the activation of
angiogenesis. Inhibition of HIF-1α function in vivo was

necessary to test the pleiotropic effect of hypoxia in tumor
growth at different organs.
Pharmacologic and dominant-negative inhibitions of
HIF-1α compromise growth of primary tumors and
metastases. 2ME2 downregulates HIF-1α, inhibits the HIFinduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activation
and angiogenesis, and has been used in vivo to block HIF-1α
activity (18–20). Treating cells under hypoxia with 2ME2
abolished the induction of HIF-1α in vitro (Fig. 4A). Therefore, 2ME2 was tested for its effect on primary tumors and
metastases. 2ME2 significantly reduced the growth of LM2 primary tumors, but had little effect on SCP2 tumors (Fig. 4B).
Because SCP2 tumors generally stop expanding after reaching
a certain size (<100 mm3), we cannot directly determine
whether 2ME2 would inhibit SCP2 tumor growth if SCP2 grew
to a similar size as LM2. Nevertheless, this result indicated
that 2ME2 could inhibit the growth of well-vascularized tumors. IHC confirmed lower HIF-1α levels in LM2 and SCP2
tumors after treatment with 2ME2 (Supplementary Fig.
S5A–B). Microvessel density and architecture analysis by
CD31 IHC showed narrower vessels in LM2 tumors by 2ME2
treatment, although 2ME2 did not seem to significantly affect

vessel density (Supplementary Fig. S5C; Fig. 4B). Consistently,
2ME2 did not affect the already compressed vessels in SCP2
tumors (Fig. 4B). Overall, these results suggest that the
primary effect of 2ME2 on primary tumor growth is through
targeting the function of HIF-1α in angiogenesis.
If angiogenesis were also the primary contribution of
HIF-1α to promote metastasis development, we would
expect that 2ME2 could reduce LM2 lung metastasis burden but have relatively little effect on SCP2 bone metastasis. To our surprise, both LM2 lung metastasis and SCP2
bone metastasis were significantly inhibited by 2ME2 treatment (Fig. 4C–D), suggesting angiogenesis-independent
functions of HIF-1α in promoting bone metastasis. Likewise, we also cannot rule out the possibility of nonangiogenic functions of HIF-1α and hypoxia in promoting lung
metastasis.
One potential caveat of using 2ME2 to inhibit HIF-1α is
the potential nonspecific effects. To block the function of
HIF-1α more specifically, a FLAG-tagged dominant-negative
(DN) form of HIF-1α (21) was stably expressed in SCP2 and
LM2 (Fig. 5A), and the cell lines were subjected to in vivo
analysis of tumor growth and metastasis. We observed simi-

lar effects of DN-HIF-1α on primary tumor and metastasis
growth as 2ME2 treatments (Fig. 5B–D). LM2 primary tumor
growth was inhibited by DN-HIF-1α, whereas SCP2 growth
was unaffected within the tested period (Fig. 5B). LM2 lung
metastasis and SCP2 bone metastasis were both significantly
inhibited (Fig. 5C and D). These results further confirm that
inhibition of HIF-1α reduces tumor growth in a siteindependent manner.
Hypoxia activates organ-specific metastasis genes. To
identify hypoxia target genes that may play a role in promoting organ-specific metastasis, LM2 and SCP2 were cultured
under ambient (21%) or low-oxygen (1%) condition for 6 or
24 hours before microarray profiling. Gene set enrichment
analysis was used to examine the enrichment for gene sets
representing the general HIF-1 target genes (22), lung metastasis gene signature (LMS; ref. 4), and bone metastasis gene
signature (3) by the hypoxic condition. The bone metastasis
gene signature and LMS include genes that are upregulated
in the highly metastatic cells (candidate metastasis enhancers) and those downregulated in highly metastatic cells
(candidate metastasis suppressors). The upregulated and
downregulated subsets were tested separately. With an

FDR q-value of 0.2 as the significance cutoff (more stringent
than the recommended 0.25), hypoxic LM2 and SCP2 both
were enriched for the general HIF-1α targets (Supplementary
Fig. S6A–C), such as VEGF (Supplementary Fig. S6D), indicating that both cells were able to turn on the canonical
HIF-1α transcription programs. Although VEGF is activated
by hypoxia at a slightly stronger level in LM2 than in SCP2,
this could not fully account for the dramatic differences in
angiogenesis in the two tumors. SCP2 may possibly express
a strong antiangiogenic factor(s) that buffers the proangiogenic activity of HIF-1α–induced factors. When metastasis
gene signatures were tested in gene set enrichment analysis, the upregulated subset of the LMS, but not the downregulated subset, was found to be significantly enriched in
hypoxic LM2 transcriptome (Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Fig. S6A–C). This finding suggests that hypoxia
may have lung metastasis–promoting functions beyond the
activation of angiogenesis. Among genes in the LMS,
ANGPTL4, an essential gene in lung metastasis formation
(23), has the strongest response to hypoxia (Supplementary
Fig. S6D).

www.aacrjournals.org

The hypoxic SCP2 gene profile did not enrich for either the
upregulated or the downregulated subset of the bone metastasis gene signature (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary
Fig. S6A–C). Nevertheless, several putative bone metastatic
genes were activated by hypoxia, including CXCR4 and DUSP1
(Supplementary Fig. S6D). Hypoxic responses of these two
genes were much weaker or absent in LM2 cells. The functional importance of CXCR4 in bone metastasis has been
established before (24, 25). DUSP1 is overexpressed in breast
carcinomas and implicated in breast cancer chemoresistance
(26). We previously identified DUSP1 as one of the 11 mostly
significantly upregulated genes in the bone-metastatic sublines of MDA-MB-231 (3). Northern blot analysis confirmed
the dramatic overexpression of DUSP1 in bone-tropic cells
(Supplementary Fig. S7A). However, the functional importance of DUSP1 in bone metastasis had not been investigated.
Using shRNA-mediated gene silencing, we knocked down
DUSP1 expression in SCP2 and observed a significant decrease in bone colonization (Supplementary Fig. S7B and
C). Furthermore, when we examined the potential clinical
importance of DUSP1 in bone metastasis by analyzing its

expression level in a published microarray data set (4), higher
DUSP1 level in primary tumors was detected in patients with
bone metastases but not lung metastasis (Supplementary
Fig. S7D). Taken together, these results suggest that hypoxia
has an organ-specific metastasis-promoting function in addition to its well-appreciated role in eliciting angiogenesis.
Hypoxia response signature for lung metastasis prognosis.
HIF-1α overexpression and hypoxia-induced gene expression
changes have been associated with poor prognosis and metastasis of breast cancer patients (27, 28). However, the prognostic value of the hypoxia gene signature in organ-specific
metastasis has not been investigated. To test this, we compared the expression profiles of LM2 or SCP2 in normoxic or
hypoxic conditions and identified differentially expressed
genes as hypoxia response signatures for each cell line (see
gene lists in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). LM2- and
SCP2-specific hypoxia response signatures were used to per-

form unsupervised hierarchical clustering of tumor samples
in the Minn and colleagues data set (4), which contains
organ-specific metastasis status of all patients in a 5-year
follow-up period. Both the LM2 and SCP2 hypoxia signatures
were able to segregate patients into two major clusters with
distinctively different outcomes in lung metastasis, whereas
the same signatures were not able to identify patients with
high risk for bone metastasis (Supplementary Figs. S8 and
S9). This result suggests that different MDA-MB-231 variants
may share a common hypoxia transcriptomic program that
can be used to predict organ-specific metastasis to lung.
Indeed, using the overlapped hypoxia gene signature containing 45 genes with 70 probe sets (Supplementary Table S5), we
successfully classified patients into two subgroups with
distinct incidence rates for lung metastasis but not bone metastasis (Fig. 6A). Kaplan-Meier curve analyses further confirmed that patients with tumor samples harboring positive

Functions of Hypoxia in Organ-Specific Metastasis

hypoxia signatures displayed significantly higher risks of
developing lung metastasis than patients without this signature (P = 0.0003 by log-rank test; Fig. 6B). Importantly,
the two subgroups of patients as classified by the common
hypoxia gene signature did not show any statistical significance in the risk of developing bone metastasis (P = 0.3037).
Taken together, our 45-gene hypoxia response signature
showed prognostic power for lung metastasis but not for
bone metastasis.

Discussion
A major bottleneck in metastasis research has been the
lack of tools to investigate tumor-stromal interactions in
real-time in living animals. Recent development of noninvasive real-time imaging methods for various signaling pathways has greatly improved our understanding of their
in vivo activities during the development of cancer (14, 17,
29, 30). In this study, we adopted and engineered a dual
luciferase imaging system to understand the dynamics of
intratumoral hypoxia stress in primary tumors and metastases, as well as the effect of hypoxia on tumor growth in
different organ microenvironments. Using such an imaging
approach, we found that the intracellular hypoxia kinetics
correlated with angiogenic abilities at both the primary site
and the distant organs. This finding is consistent with the
canonical paradigm of the relationship between hypoxia
and angiogenesis.
The distinct behaviors of LM2 and SCP2 in primary tumor
growth raise an interesting question: Would growth of one
cell line be influenced by the presence of the other cell line?
We addressed this question by labeling LM2 and SCP2 with
different luciferases and coinjecting it into mammary glands
at variable ratios. When total cell number injected was kept
constant (1 × 106), the tumor volume declined as the fraction
of LM2 in the mixture decreased (Supplementary Fig. S10A),
consistent with the fact that LM2 is more tumorigenic in
mammary glands than SCP2. Surprisingly, when each cell line
was detected separately by BLI and normalized to the initial
injection amount, decreased LM2 growth potential corresponded to its lower percentage in the implanted mixture,
whereas SCP2 showed the opposite trend (Supplementary
Fig. S10B–D). Perhaps the most striking observation was that
at week 3 after tumor implantation, the absolute number of
SCP2 cells (measured by Fluc BLI) in tumors initiated by the
10% SCP2/90% LM2 mixture became higher than that in
tumors containing 50%, 90%, and 100% of SCP2 during the
initial implantation (Supplementary Fig. S10C, right). This
result suggested that the net output of balancing the angiogenic activity (factors from both LM2 and SCP2, e.g., VEGF)
and the antiangiogenic activity (unidentified factor produced
by SCP2) favors SCP2 growth but suppresses LM2 growth,
compared with their respective homogenous tumors. An important implication of this finding is that the primary tumor
growth properties of SCP2 and LM2 are substantially influenced by the tumor microenvironment instead of being completely dominated by the cell autonomous mechanisms.

It is interesting to note the apparent lack of extensive angiogenesis in the aggressive bone metastases generated by SCP2
confirmed by CD31 IHC, von Willebrand factor IHC, or dextran
labeling (data not shown). This finding is in contrast to previous studies showing the positive CD31 staining in bone metastases formed by MDA-MB-231 and linking the HIF-1α activity
in bone metastasis directly to angiogenesis (20, 21). We believe
the difference can be explained by the heterogeneous nature of
the parental MDA-MB-231 cell line. By using the relatively
homogenous organotropic sublines, we were able to discover
pleiotropic functions of hypoxia in promoting bone- and lungspecific metastasis beyond regulating angiogenesis.
Intriguingly, although the inhibition of HIF-1α reduces
both bone and lung metastases, the hypoxia response signature is prognostic of lung but not bone metastasis in breast
cancer patients. This paradox could be explained by the different mechanisms through which hypoxia contributes to
tumor growth at the different organs. Development of lung
metastasis and the growth of the primary tumors both rely
on productive angiogenesis in response to hypoxia. Such a
function could be selected for in the primary tumor during
tumor progression and consequently promote lung metastasis after tumor dissemination. Furthermore, the LMS genes
are highly enriched in hypoxic conditions. As HIF-1α expression has been found to progressively increase during human
breast carcinogenesis (31), elevated HIF-1α may induce the
activation of LMS genes, such as ANGPTL4, in highly aggressive breast carcinoma. Such activation may subsequently
prime tumor cells to effectively generate pulmonary metastases. Thus, it is not surprising that the hypoxia response signature correlates with higher risk of lung metastasis. On the
other hand, only a limited number of genes (such as CXCR4
and DUSP1) among the hypoxia response signature contribute directly to bone metastasis, whereas many other common hypoxia-regulated genes, including various angiogenic
factors, may have relatively little direct influence on bone
metastasis. Therefore, the overall hypoxia response gene signature was not able to stratify patients for risk of bone
metastasis based on the gene expression profiles of their primary tumors. Nevertheless, this finding does not exclude the
targeting of HIF-1α as a viable strategy for the treatment of
bone metastasis, as our current study clearly indicated the
inhibitory effect of DN-HIF1α or 2ME2 on bone metastasis.
Overall, we showed the pleiotropic functions of hypoxia/
HIF-1α at different stages of breast cancer progression and
metastasis (Fig. 6D). In the primary tumor, hypoxia-induced
angiogenesis promotes neovascularization and continuous
expansion of the tumor mass. Furthermore, hypoxia transcriptional program may enhance the expression of LMS
genes, which empowers departing tumor cells with the ability
to effectively colonize the lung microenvironment. On the
other hand, although hypoxia-induced angiogenesis seems
to be noncritical for the aggressive growth of bone metastasis
in the cell system studied, hypoxia does contribute to bone
metastasis by activating the expression of a few bone metastasis genes, such as DUSP1 and CXCR4. Therefore, HIF-1α in
breast cancer may be targeted to control the metastasis in
multiple distant organs.
