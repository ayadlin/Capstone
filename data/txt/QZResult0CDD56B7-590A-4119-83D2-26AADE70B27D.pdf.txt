ABSTRACT:
Oncogenic alterations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling
are frequently observed in lung cancer patients with worse differentiation and poor
prognosis. However, the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
is currently limited in selected patients with EGFR mutations. Therefore, in this study,
we investigated the potential molecular mechanism that contributes to cell viability
and the response of gefitinib, one of the EGFR-TKIs, in lung cancer models with widetype EGFR (wtEGFR). Interestingly, we found that EGF-induced EGFR endocytosis
is existed differently between gefitinib-sensitive and -insensitive lung cancer cell
lines. Suppressing EGFR endocytos decreased cell viability and increased apoptotic
cell death in gefitinib-insensitive lung cancer with wtEGFR in vitro and in vivo. In
addition, we found that Rab25 was differentially expressed in between gefitinibsensitive and -insensitive lung cancer cells. Rab25 knockdown caused the changed
EGFR endocytosis and reverted the gefitinib response in gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer
with wtEGFR in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest a novel insight
that EGFR endocytosis is a rational therapeutic target in lung cancer with wtEGFR, in
which the combined efficacy with gefitinib is expected. Furthermore, we demonstrated
that Rab25 plays an important role in EGFR endocytosis and gefitinib therapy.

INTRODUCTION

monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) [8] and small-molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [9, 10]. mAbs act by
binding to the EGFR extracellular region and compete
with its ligands, whereas TKIs were designed to reversibly
bind the ATP-binding site of the cytoplasmic kinase
domain of EGFR, thereby inhibiting its TK activity.
Gefitinib is a selective EGFR-TKI and was the first
approved for clinical use as an orally administered drug
for patients with lung cancer [9, 11]. The malfunction in
EGFR TK activity caused by gefitinib results in obstruction
of cellular signaling mediated mainly through the RASRAF-MEK-ERK and the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathways.
This eventually leads to decreased cell proliferation and
increased apoptosis [12]. Apoptotic cell death induced by
gefitinib is accompanied by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest with

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a
transmembrane growth factor receptor with tyrosine
kinase (TK) activity that controls cell proliferation and
survival [1, 2]. Cellular activity of EGFR is dysregulated
by several mechanisms including gene mutation, copy
number variation, and protein overexpression [3, 4].
Oncogenic alterations in EGFR are frequently reported
in patients with lung cancer and are implicated in the
pathogenesis of the disease such as increased tumor
proliferation, poor differentiation, and a worse prognosis,
indicating that EGFR is an important therapeutic target
in lung cancer [4-7]. Based on previous reports, EGFRtargeted drugs have been developed as two major types:

down-regulation of CDKs/cyclins [13] and anti-apoptotic
proteins [12]. Moreover, gefitinib alone or in combination
with other chemotherapy shows clinically meaningful
antitumor activity in patients with advanced lung cancer
[14-16]. However, the therapeutic efficacy of gefitinib
increases noticeably in patients with lung cancer who
have somatic mutations in the EGFR TK domain such
as deletions in exon 19 or a point mutation (L858R) in
exon 21 [17, 18]. However, the frequency of patients with
EGFR mutations in unselected lung cancer is 10-40%,
depending on the ethnicity of the study population [19,
20]. In other words, most of patients with lung cancer have
wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR) which generally exhibits no
response to gefitinib treatment [21]. Nevertheless, 10 ~
20% patients with lung cancer without EGFR mutations
therapeutically benefit from gefitinib, implying that EGFR
mutations may not be the sole determinants of gefitinib
efficacy [22, 23]. However, the potential molecular
mechanism that expands the clinical benefit of gefitinib in
patients with lung cancer and wtEGFR remains unclear.
Binding of ligands to EGFR induces translocation
of EGFR from the plasma membrane to the intracellular
region independently of its phosphorylation-mediated TK
activation [24, 25]. Ligand-induced EGFR endocytosis is
mainly mediated by clathrin- and non-clathrin mediated
endocytosis [26]. In particular, dynamin, which is a
guanosine 5’-triphosphatase (GTPase), functions as a
key regulator in both EGFR endocytic pathways [27].
Furthermore, the change in EGFR endocytosis caused
by dynamin depletion attenuates EGFR activation and
degradation. [28]. Actually, EGFR endocytosis and its
endosomal-mediated sorting are thought to be a cellular
mechanism to induce degradation and termination of
activated EGFR signaling or as a recycling mechainsm
to return to the cell surface for continued signaling
[29]. However, some reports show that the intracellular
translocation of EGFR regulates the EGFR signaling
pathway, consequently affecting cell growth and survival
[30, 31]. The impaired EGFR endocytic pathway is
implicated in carcinogenesis, as it potentially results in
uncontrolled signal transduction [24, 32]. However, the
therapeutic relevance of EGFR endocytosis in lung cancer
has not been investigated.
In this study, we examined the phenotypic and
molecular differences between gefitinib -sensitive and
-insensitive lung cancer cells with wtEGFR using in vitro
and in vivo models and found a potential relationship
between gefitinib response and EGFR endocytosis. We
also demonstrated that suppressing EGFR endocytosis
could aeffect cell viability and the gefitinib response
in gefitinib-insensitive lung cancer with wtEGFR.
Additonally, we also confirmed that Rab25 is associated
with EGFR endocytosis and the gefitinib response.

Effects of gefitinib on cell survival and EGFR
signaling in lung cancer cells with wtEGFR
We first proflied gefitinib response in the eight lung
cancer cell lines (H1703, Calu-1, H441, H522, SNU-1327,
SNU-2292, H358 and Calu-3) with wtEGFR. Six of the
eight lung cancer cell lines (H1703, Calu-1, H441, H522,
SNU-1327 and SNU-2292) were relatively insensitive to
gefitinib (IC50>10 μM) compared to the other two lung
cancer cell lines (H358 and Calu-3) (IC50<10 μM) (Figure
1A). To examine further differential effects of gefitinib
between these lung cancer cell lines, H358 and H1703
cells were chosen as gefitinib-sensitive and -insensitive
cells, respectively. In the following comparative
experiments, H358 cells exhibited morphological changes,
retarded wound healing and G0/G1 arrest of the cell
cycle after gefitinib treatment but H1703 cells did not
show any changes in cell phenotype following gefitinib
treatment (Figure 1B-D). We next investigated whether the
differential effects of gefitinib between these lung cancer
cell lines were associated with activation status of the
EGFR signaling pathway. Interestingly, phosphorylation of
EGF-induced EGFR was inhibited by gefitinib treatment
in both H358 and H1703 cells regardless of the gefitinib
response (Figure 1E). In gefitinib-insensitive H1703 cells,
we also profiled the activation statues of multiple EGFR
phosphorylation sites that regulate various downstream
cellular signaling pathways. As shown in Figure 1F, seven
of ten phosphorylation sites (Tyr845, Tyr1086, Tyr1148,
Tyr1173, Ser1046/1047, and Ser1070) were activated by
EGF stimulation, but all EGFR phosphorylated sites were
blocked by gefitinib treatment. Moreover, phosphorylation
of AKT and ERK, well-known downstream molecules
in the EGFR signaling pathway, was also inhibited by
gefitinib in both H358 and H1703 cells (Figure 1G).
Similar results were detected in the other six lung cancer
cell lines (Data not shown). These results suggest the
existence of an unknown mechanism that regulates the
response to gefitinib in lung cancer with wtEGFR.

EGFR endocytosis is associated with the gefitinib
response in lung cancer with wtEGFR
Some reports show the possibility that ligandinduced internalization of EGFR, one of its degradation
processes, is a potential molecular mechanism that
controls cellular signaling independent of its kinase
activity [25, 29, 33]. Therefore, we investigated whether
the cellular distribution of EGFR correlates with the
different responses to gefitinib between gefitinib-sensitive
and -insensitive cells using immunofluorescence staining.

As shown in Figure 2A, EGFR was localized within the
intracellular region forming a punctate structure after EGF
stimulation in both H358 and H1703 cells. However, this
spatial change of EGFR induced by EGF stimulation was
suppressed after gefitinib treatment in gefitinib-sensitive
H358 cells but not in gefitinib-insensitive H1703 cells. The
distinguished profile of EGFR distribution between these
two lung cancer cell lines was confirmed by fluorescence
intensity plot analysis (Figure 2A, right panel) and in other
lung cancer cell lines (Supplemental Figure S1).
To further examine whether the differential status
of EGFR distribution between gefitinib-sensitive and
-insensitive cells resulted from dysregulation of EGFR
endocytosis, we determined the frequencies of EGFinduced EGFR endocytosis by flow cytometry with
fluorescent-conjugated EGF. As shown in Figure 2B, the
frequency of internalized EGF in H358 cells increased

gradually in a time-dependent manner and then decreased
after gefitinib treatment. In contrast, EGF internalization
in H1703 cells was not reduced after gefitinib treatment
compared to that of H358 cells (Figure 2B). These results
suggest that EGFR endocytosis may be one of potential
mechanisms to explain the different responses to gefitinib
between gefitinib-sensitive and -insensitive cells in lung
cancer with wtEGFR.

Antitumor effects by inhibiting EGFR endocytosis
in vitro and in vivo
Based on previous results, we hypothesized that
regulating EGFR endocytosis could reverse the response
to gefitinib in gefitinib-insensitive cells. To test the
hypothesis, we used two inhibitors of EGFR endocytosis;

difference in EGFR cellular distribution after gefitinib treatment was profiled by immunoflurescence staining. Cells were pretreated with

dynasore and dynole 34-2, which are known potent
inhibitors of dynamin, a key molecule in the EGFR
endocytic pathways. As shown in Figure 3A, EGFinduced EGFR spatial changes were effectively blocked
after treatment with dynasore or dynole 34-2 in gefitinibinsensitive H1703 cells. Moreover, dynasore or dynole
34-2 significantly reduced cell viability in combination
with gefitinib compared to those in treatment with the
drugs or gefitinib alone (Figure 3A and Supplemental
Figure S2). Next, we examined the frequencies of
apoptotic cells and expression statues of apoptosis-related
proteins to evaluate whether the decreased cell viability
was related to apoptotic cell death. As shown in Figure
3C, treatment with either dynasore or dynole 34-2 caused
apoptosis in gefitinib-insensitive H1703 cells and the
proportion of apoptotic cells increased substantially in a
combined treatment with the EGFR endocytosis inhibitors
and gefitinib. Moreover, the increased apoptotic cell
death induced by the EGFR endocytosis inhibitors was
accompanied by upregulation of cleaved PARP and downregulation of Mcl-1, survivin, XIAP and livin (Figure 3D).
The expression changes in these apoptosis-related proteins
were higher in the combined treatment with EGFR
endocytosis inhibitors and gefitinib than that of the other
single treatment.
We then evaluated the anti-tumor efficacy of an

EGFR endocytosis inhibitor in vitro using a mouse
xenograft model. Gefitinib-insensitive SNU-1327 cells
were injected subcutaneously into athymic nude nu/nu
mice. When the average size of tumors reached 100-200
mm3, the mice were treated intraperitoneally with either
dynasore or gefitinib alone, or a combined treatment of
dynasore and gefitinib. As shown in Figure 4A, mice
treated with the combination of dynasore and gefitinib
showed significantly the most inhibited efficacy of tumor
formation compared to mice treated with each drug
alone, and showed the same results as those of observed
in vitro. In addition, we observed that the lowest number
of proliferating cells and highest number of apoptotic
cells were found in tumors from mice treated with the
combination of dynasore and gefitinib (Figure 4B). These
findings suggest that suppressing EGFR endocytosis
can play a role to overcome the therapeutic limitation of
gefitinib in lung cancer with wtEGFR.

Rab25 expression is related to EGFR endocytosis
and the gefitinib response in lung cancer with
wtEGFR
EGFR endocytosis is a complex cellular process
which includes many modulating proteins [29]. Therefore,

EGFR endocytosis-related effector or regulator proteins
can be used as molecular markers to improve the
therapeutic efficacy of gefitinib in lung cancer with
wtEGFR. To demonstrate the hypothesis, we attempted
to identify differentially expressed genes related to EGFR
endocytosis using a genome-wide gene expression assay in
gefitinib-sensitive H358 and -insensitive H1703 cells. We
found six downregulated genes and two upregulated genes
between these two lung cancer cell lines (Supplemental
Table S1). Different expression statuses of selected genes
were validated by real time-polymerase chain reaction
analysis (Data not shown). Rab GTPases (Rab25 and
Rab17) exhibited the most distinct gene expression
profile among the selected genes. Basically, Rab25 are
key regulators in endosomal trafficking and recycling
back to the plasma membrane of EGFR [34]. Therefore,
we subsequently monitored the endosomal distribution
status of EGFR in H358 and H1703 cells after EGF
stimulation. As shown in Figure 5A, EGFR was localized
in early and recycling endosomes after EGF stimulation

in H358 cells expressing Rab25. In contrast, EGFR was
only localized in early endosomes of H1703 cells with no
Rab25 expression. To further investigate whether Rab25
expression affects EGFR endocytosis, we transfected
siRab25 or the scrambled (Scr) control into H358 cells
with Rab25 expression. The change of EGFR endocytosis
was analyzed by monitoring the internalized proportion
of fluorescent-conjugated EGF by flow cytometry. As
shown in Figure 5B, internalized EGF increased and then
decreased following gefitinib treatment in Scr-transfected
cells. However, this inhibition of EGF internalization by
gefitinib was less prominent in siRab25-transfected cells
than that in Scr-transfected cells.
Next, to evaluate whether the expression status
of Rab25 is associated with the response to gefitinib in
lung cancer with wtEGFR, we performed a comparative
analysis between Rab25 expression and IC50 values to
gefitinib in eight lung cancer cell lines. As shown in Figure
5C, gefitinib-insensitive cells (H1703, SNU-2292, Calu1, H441, SNU-1327 and H522) showed relatively low

expression levels of Rab25 compared to that in gefitinibsensitive cells (H358 and Calu-3) (p < 0.05). These results
suggest that Rab25 functions significantly in EGFR
endocytosis and the response of gefitinib in lung cancer
with wtEGFR.

(Figure 6B and C). Moreover, induction of G0/G1 cell
cycle arrest caused by gefitinib was smaller in siRab25transfected cells than that in Scr-transfected cells (Figure
6D).
To further investigate the changes in the gefitinib
response by inhibiting Rab25 expression in vivo, H358
cells stably transfected with shRab25 or shScrambled
control (Scr) were injected subcutaneously into athymic
nude nu/nu mice. When the average size of tumors reached
100-200 mm3, the mice were divided into four groups:
Scr/DMSO, Scr/gefitinib, shRab25/DMSO, and shRab25/
gefitinib, and treated intraperitoneally with gefitinib or
DMSO. As shown in Figure 7A, although tumor growth
in the shScr/gefitinib and shRab25/gefitinib mice groups
was delayed after gefitinib treatment, the inhibitory effect
of tumor growth caused by gefitinib was higher in the
shScr/gefitinib mice groups than in the shRab25/gefitinib
mice groups. In addition, the anti-proliferative effect and
apoptosis induced by gefitinib was relatively reduced in

Inhibiting Rab25 expression reverses the response
to gefitinib in vitro and in vivo
To demonstrate whether regulating Rab25
expression affects sensitivity to gefitinib, we tranfected
siRab25 or Scr into gefitinib-sensitive H358 cells
expressing Rab25. As shown in Figure. 6a, morphological
changes induced by gefitinib were relatively reduced in
siRab25-transfected cells compared with those in Scrtransfected cells.The inhibitory effect of gefitinib on
cell viability also decreased significantly in siRab25transfected cells compared to those in Scr-transfected cells

shRab25/gefitinib mice groups compared to those in shScr/
gefitinib mice groups (Figure 7B). These results support
the above findings that the status of Rab25 expression is
associated with the response to gefitinib in lung cancer
with wtEGFR.

confirmed that EGFR phosphorylation was suppressed
after gefitinib treatment in all lung cancer cell lines
with wtEGFR regardless of responsiveness to gefitinib.
Furthermore, the mutual relationship between the gefitinib
response and the oncogenic changes of EGFR such as gene
amplification and overexpression remains controversial.
Therefore, solely targeting EGFR phosphorylation may
not be sufficient to inhibit EGFR-mediated signaling in
lung cancer without EGFR mutations, indicating that we
do not fully understand EGFR signaling in lung cancer.
Based on previous reports and our findings, we attempted
to identify other EGFR-related cellular mechanisms in
lung cancer with wtEGFR that were associated with cell
survival and the gefitinib response independently of its TK
activity.
Interestingly, we observed that EGF-induced
EGFR endocytosis progressed continuously in gefitinibinsensitive cells regardless of gefitinib treatment, whereas
it was suppressed by gefitinib in gefitinib-sensitive
cells. We also demonstrated that the difference between
these cell lines was correlated with EGFR endocytosis.
Although EGFR endocytosis caused by ligand binding
has been generally known as a process of down-regulation
and degradation for its signal activation, EGFR was
occasionally localized in intracellular organelles such as
mitochondria and nucleus for cell survival and growth
[30, 31]. Furthermore, EGFR signaling is also regulated
by the endosomal trafficking before receptor degradation

DISCUSSION
In this study, we described a novel association
between gefitinib, one of the EGFR-TKIs, and EGFR
endocytosis in the treatment of lung cancer with
wtEGFR using in vitro and in vivo models. Gefitinib
was initially developed because improper activation of
EGFR signaling appears frequently in lung cancer [2,
3]. However, contrary to expectations, the therapeutic
efficacy of gefitinib was observed at a very low frequency
in all patients with lung cancer, and the improved survival
benefit of gefitinib treatment was mostly detected in the
specifically selected patients with lung cancer who have
EGFR mutations [23]. In other words, patients with
wtEGFR, which includes most of the patients with lung
cancer, could not expect treatment efficacy from gefitinib.
The pharmacological activity of gefitinib is derived from
suppressing phosphorylation-mediated TK activity in the
EGFR signaling pathway [9]. However, some reports
showed disputable results that growth inhibition does
not occur in gefitinib-insensitive cells, although EGFR
phosphorylation is blocked by gefitinib [35-37]. We also

via interaction with various adaptors or signaling
molecules [25, 29]. Thus, EGFR endocytosis might be a
potent mechanism which contributes to the therapeutic
limitation of gefitinib in gefitinib-insensitive lung cancer
with wtEGFR. Evidence supporting this hypothesis
was detected during endocytosis of Met which is one of
the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) with EGFR [38].
That research showed that oncogenic changes of Met
endocytosis could be caused by mutations in its kinase
domain leading to increased tumorigenicity. Indeed,
obstructing Met endocytosis with inhibitors results in
tumor regression and reversion of the Met-TKI response.
Surprisingly, we also found that suppressing EGFR
edndocytosis with inhibitors (dyansore and dynole 34-2)
resulted in reduced cell viability and increased apoptotic
cell death in gefitinib-insensitive lung cancer cells with
wtEGFR, and that inhibitory effect was more enhanced in
combination with gefitinib. In particular, dynasore showed
a significantly enhanced anti-proliferative effect and
apoptotic cell death in mice xenografted with gefitinibinsensitive lung cancer cells with wtEGFR. These results
suggest that EGFR endocytosis is a rational target for

treating lung cancer with wtEGFR and the efficacy of the
combination of its inhibitor and gefitinib is expected.
The molecular mechanism regulating the EGFR
endocytic pathway is very complex and tightly controlled
by a variety of proteins [25, 33] However, dysfunction of
these mediators is currently implicated in human cancers
[24, 39]. Therefore, we hypothesized that changed
expression of genes related to EGFR endocytosis might
be concerned with the different response of gefitinib
treatment in lung cancer with wtEGFR. Using a genomewide expression assay, we identified differentially
expressed genes between gefitinib-sensitive and
-insensitive lung cancer cells. Based on their biological
processes and molecular functions, Rab25 was selected as
a potential molecular factor associated with the response
to gefitinib treatment. Rab small GTPases including Rab25
play an important role in intracellular vesicle trafficking
of RTKs [40]. Rab25, a member of the RAB11 subfamily,
specifically controls the return of internalized RTKs
to the cell surface [41]. The relationship between the
role of Rab25 and tumorigenesis remains controversial.

Rab25 have been detected in ovarian and breast cancer
[42], whereas they function as a tumor suppressor in
colon cancer [43]. However, the precise role of Rab25
in lung cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we
determined that Rab25 regulated EGFR endocytosis, and
its expression status was significantly correlated with
the response of gefitinib in lung cancer with wtEGFR.
Moreover, we demonstrated that silencing Rab25 reversed
the sensitivity to gefitinib in gefitinib-sensitive lung
cancer cells expressing normally. The effects of Rab25
knockdown on tumor proliferation and apoptosis were also
confirmed in mice xenografted with gefitinib-sensitive
lung cancer cells with wtEGFR. Therefore, our findings
indicate that Rab25 plays a crucial role in EGFR signaling
in lung cancer with wtEGFR.
Although we confirmed meaningful EGFR
endocytosis clues that could contribute to treating lung
cancer without appropriate therapeutic options, this
study had some limitations. First, there is no drug which
specifically targets EGFR endocytosis and is approved
for clinical use. Actually, the endocytosis inhibitors used
in this study inhibit the internalization of other RTKs as
well as EGFR, because the RTK endocytosis mechanism
exists in the cell membrane and is a common process
induced after binding of their ligands [44]. However,
EGFR endocytosis is the most reasonable target among
the RTKs as oncogenic changes from EGFR signaling
mostly occur lung cancer compared to those of other RTK
signaling. Second, we did not evaluate Rab25 function in
patients with lung cancer and wtEGFR who did not have a
response to gefitinib. Therefore, further studies are needed
to investigate the relevance of Rab25 in clinical samples.
In conclusion, we provided novel insights that EGFR
endocytosis is important for treating lung cancer with
wtEGFR in in vitro and in vivo models, suggesting that it
is a promising target to improve therapeutic efficacy when
its inhibitor and EGFR-TKI are administered together.
In addition, we identified that EGFR endocytosis-related
Rab25 expression is crucially considered when patients
with lung cancer and wtEGFR are treated with gefitinib.

Cell lines and cell culture
The lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (Calu-3, H441,
and H522), squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (H1703
and Calu-1), and the bronchial alveolar carcinoma cell
lines (H358) were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Additional lung
adenocarcinoma cell lines (SNU-1327 and SNU-2292)
were obtained from the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul,
South Korea). H358, H1703, Calu-1, H441, H522, SNU1327, and SNU-2292 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Calu-3 cells
were cultured in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. All cultured cells were incubated in a
humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.

MTT assay
After drug treatment, cells were mixed with 20 µl
of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) (Sigma) solution (5 mg/ml in 1x PBS)
in each well and further incubated for 4 h at 37°C. The
medium was removed and 200 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) (Sigma) was added in each well. Absorbance
was detected at 540 nm with an iMark microplate reader
(c). Results are presented as a relative percent surviving
normalized to untreated control cells. The experiment
was repeated independently three times. IC50 values were
determined using the microplate reader software Softmax
Pro (Molecular Devices Cooperation Corp., Sunnyvale,
CA).

Fluorescent-conjugated EGF uptake

The membranes were blocked and further incubated
overnight at 4°C with appropriate primary antibodies. The
membranes were washed and incubated for 1 h at 4°C with
appropriate secondary antibody and visualized on X-ray
film using the ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents
(Amersham). Band density was analyzed with Quantityone™ image analysis software (Bio-Rad).

EGFR internalization was analyzed by modified
flow cytometry with fluorescent-conjugated EGF. Briefly,
the cells were washed with 1× PBS after EGF stimulation
and further washed with an acid solution (0.5% acetic
acid, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 3.0) for 5 min at 4°C. The cells were
then trypsinized and resuspended in FACS buffer. The
status of fluorescent- conjugated EGF uptake was analyzed
using FACS Calibur and Cellquest software (Becton
Dickinson). The percentage of cells with internalized EGF
was analyzed using WinMDI 2.9 software (The Scripps
Institute,. La Jolla, CA).

Propidium iodide (PI) staining
The cells were harvested and washed twice with
cold 1× PBS, then fixed in cold 70% ethanol for 2 h at
4°C. After the ethanol solution was removed, the cells
were stained with PI staining solution (40 μg PI/100
μg RNase A/1 ml PBS) for 1 h at 37°C. The status of
PI- stained DNA content was analyzed using FACS
Calibur and Cellquest software (Becton Dickinson). The
percentage of cells in the sub-G1, G1, S, and G2/M phases
was analyzed with WinMDI 2.9 software (The Scripps
Institute, La Jolla, CA).

Apoptotic cell death assay
Apoptotic cell death was measured with an FITC
Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences,
San Diego, CA), according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, the cells were harvested after drug treatment
and washed with cold 1× PBS twice, resuspended in
1× binding buffer, and counted at a concentration of 1
× 106 cells/mL. Aliquots (100 μL) of resuspended cells
were transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube and incubated
with FITC Annexin V (5 μL) and PI (5 μL) for 15 min
at room temperature in the dark. Finally, 500 μL of 1×
binding buffer was added to each tube and the cells were
then analyzed by FACS Caliber (Becton Dickinson,
Hertfordshire, UK). The percentage of FITC Annexin
V-positive cells was analyzed using WinMDI 2.9 software
(The Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA).

EGFR phosphorylation antibody array
The phosphorylation status of 10 different
EGFR sites was simultaneously detected by EGFR
phosphorylation antibody array (RayBiotech, Norcross,
GA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
membranes were exposed to photographic X-ray films.
Signal intensity was quantified by Quantity-one™ image
analysis software (Bio-Rad). The relative expression
levels of the phosphorylated EGFR sites were normalized
to total EGFR signal in each membrane.

Whole genome expression assay

Immunofluorescence staining

A gene expression profile of H358 and H1703
lung cancer cells was obtained using the genome-wide
HumanHT-12 v4 Expression Bead Chip arrays (Illumina,
San Diego, CA). Briefly, total RNA was isolated using
TRIZOL reagent and quantified using an ND-1000
spectrophotometer (Nano-Drop, Wilmington, DE). After
RNA amplification, labeling, hybridization, scanning
and statistical analysis of samples were performed
by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea). Array data export
processing and analysis was performed using Illumina
Genome Studio v2009.2. The quality of the hybridization
and overall chip performance were monitored by visually
inspecting both internal quality control checks and the raw
scanned data and normalized by quantiles.

Cells were cultured on 18-mm cover glasses and
washed with ice-cold 1× PBS. After drug treatment,
the cover glass was fixed with 4% PFA/1× PBS for 15
min at 37°C, and washed three times with 1× PBS-T,
and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100/1× PBS for
30 min at room temperature. All of the following steps
were performed in the dark. After blocking with 5%
BSA/1× PBS-T, the cover glass was incubated with the
appropriated antibodies in 5% BSA/1× PBS-T overnight at
4°C. The next day, the cover glass was washed three times
with 1× PBS-T and incubated with fluorescent conjugated
secondary antibodies in 5% BSA/1× PBS-T for 1 h at
room temperature and couterstained with DAPI (Sigma)
for 10 min at room temperature. After washing, the cover
glass was dried and mounted using fluorescent mounting
medium (Dako, Carpenteria, CA). Fluorescence images of
cells were captured under an Olympus BX51 microscope
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with DP70 digital
camera and DP Manager software.

siRab25 (5’-GGA GCU CUA UGA CCA UGC U-3’) were
synthesized at Bioneer (Daejeon, Korea). Transfection of
cells with siRNAs was performed using LipofectAMINE
2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Stable knockdown of Rab25 expression was
established by shRNA transfection. H358 cells (2 × 105
cells/well) were seeded and incubated for 24 h prior to
viral infection. After replacing the culture medium with
a Polybrene/media mixture, the cells were incubated with
shScrambled control (Scr) and Rab25 shRNA lentiviral
particles (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA)
overnight. The next day, the culture medium was replaced
with complete growth medium, and stable clones
expressing shRNA were selected via further incubation
with puromycin (1 μg/mL).

Results are expressed as mean ± standard error.
Multiple comparisons were performed using one-way
ANOVA with SPSS ver. 12.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL).
Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.

Male athymic nude (nu/nu) mice (20g, 6 weeks
old) were purchased from Nara Biotech (Seoul, Korea).
Lung cancer SNU-1327 (5 × 106 cells) and H358 (1
× 107 cells) were injected subcutaneously into the
flanking regions of mice together with Matrigel (1:1)
(BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium). When the
tumor reached a size of 100-200 mm3, the mice were
treated intraperitoneally with appropriate drugs (details
in the Figureure legends) and randomly divided into four
groups (five mice per group). Tumor diameters were
measured with calipers twice per weekly for ≥ 5 weeks.
Tumor volumes were calculated with the following
formula: volume (mm3) = width2 × length/2. The mice
were sacrificed, and tumor tissues were collected for
histological analysis. Hematoxylin and eosin stain or
immunohistochemistry staining was performed on the
tumor sections. Immunostaining for Ki67 was carried
out using the Polink-2 HRP Plus Broad DAB Detection
System (GBI Labs, Mukilteo, WA) with a monoclonal
mouse antibody to human Ki67 (Dako, Carpenteria,
CA). Apoptotic cells were determined by using the
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end
labeling assay (Millipore, Temecula, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The stained images were
captured under an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan) equipped with DP70 digital camera and the
DP Manager software. Staining results were evaluated by
pathologists according to the immunodetection of stain
intensity. All mice procedures were performed according
to the Institutional Animal Care and Use and IRB
committees (KUIACUC-2013-80) at the Korea University
(Seoul, Korea).
