Abstract
AHA1 (activator of HSP90 ATPase) is a cochaperone of the
ATP-dependent molecular chaperone, HSP90, which is involved in the maturation, stabilization/degradation, and
function of oncogenic proteins. HSP90 operates in a multimeric complex driven by the binding and hydrolysis of ATP.
Treatment of cells with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) results in the degradation
of client proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. As
AHA1 increases the ATPase activity of HSP90, we hypothesized
that modulation of AHA1 expression could influence the
activity of client proteins and/or the cellular response to 17AAG. We show that the basal expression of AHA1 is different
across a panel of human cancer cell lines, and that treatment
with 17-AAG resulted in sustained AHA1 up-regulation.
Increasing the expression of AHA1 did not affect the sensitivity
to 17-AAG, but did increase C-RAF activity and the levels of
phosphorylated MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 without affecting total
levels of these proteins or of client proteins C-RAF, ERBB2, or
CDK4. Conversely, small interfering RNA–selective knockdown
of >80% of AHA1 expression decreased C-RAF activity and
reduced the levels of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
Moreover, the AHA1 knockdown resulted in a significant (P <
0.05) increase in sensitivity to 17-AAG, due in part to a 2- to
3-fold increase in apoptosis. These results show that the
reduction of AHA1 levels could decrease the phosphorylation
of key signal transduction proteins, and for the first time,
separate the activation and stabilization functions of HSP90.
Furthermore, AHA1 knockdown could sensitize cancer cells to
17-AAG. We conclude that modulation of AHA1 might be a
potential therapeutic strategy to increase sensitivity to HSP90
inhibitors. [Cancer Res 2008;68(4):1187–96]

Introduction
HSP90 is a unique and essential molecular chaperone in all
eukaryotic cells (1). It forms the core component of a multimeric
chaperone complex that regulates the balance of stabilization,
activation, and degradation of client proteins including numerous
transcription factors and kinases. Client protein binding to HSP90
promotes conformational states that permit their phosphorylation
or interactions with specific cognate ligands such as steroid

hormones (2). Of note, HSP90 plays an especially important role
when cells are under stress (3). HSP90 is required to maintain the
conformational stability and function of a number of key oncogenic
client proteins, e.g., C-RAF, CDK4, and ERBB2 which are involved in
signaling pathways crucial for the development and maintenance
of the malignant phenotype (2, 4). By chaperoning otherwise
relatively unstable proteins (5, 6), HSP90 can enable these signaling
proteins to remain poised for activation (7). Furthermore, in cancer
cells, HSP90 allows proteins with activating but potentially
destabilizing mutations to continue to function rather than being
degraded, and hence supports malignant transformation and
progression (8–13).
AHA1 (activator of HSP90 ATPase) is a cochaperone of HSP90
which has been identified in our institution (14). It interacts with
HSP90 along with other cochaperones including HOP/Sti1 (15),
P50/Cdc37 (16), P23/Sba1 (17, 18), CyP40/Cpr6 (19), and Cpr7 (20).
These various accessory proteins, and others, interact in a chaperone cycle driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis (21, 22). The
ATP binding state of HSP90 determines which combination of
cochaperones is bound at particular stages of the cycle, and the
ATPase activity of HSP90 controls the rate of the chaperone cycle
(22, 23). The intrinsic ATPase activity of human HSP90 is relatively
low (24) compared with HSP90 counterparts from other organisms
such as yeast (21, 25). However, the cochaperone AHA1 increases
the ATPase activity of human HSP90 in biochemical assays,
suggesting that it may play a significant role in the ATP-driven
HSP90 chaperone cycle in the cell (14).
HSP90 is an important target for cancer drugs because its
inhibition causes the depletion of client proteins involved in tumor
cell proliferation, survival, and indeed, all the hallmark traits of
malignancy (26, 27). Therapeutic selectivity of HSP90 inhibitors
can result from the exploitation of oncogene addiction and
dependence on the stress response (28). HSP90 inhibitors block
the NH2-terminal ATP pocket of HSP90 and thereby inhibit the
essential hydrolysis step in the chaperone cycle (29), leading to the
degradation of multiple oncogenic proteins by the ubiquitinproteasome pathway (30, 31). Phase 1 trials with the first-in-class
HSP90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) provided proof of principle for HSP90 inhibition in human
tumors and showed, in our own study, prolonged stable disease in
two patients with advanced malignant melanoma (32). Activity was
also seen in combination studies in breast cancer and multiple
myeloma (33). 17-AAG causes the induction of HSP72 and the
depletion of client protein levels (e.g., C-RAF, CDK4, ERBB2), which
represents the molecular signature of HSP90 inhibition (34). As
AHA1 increases the ATPase activity of HSP90, understanding
the effects of AHA1 on HSP90 and its client proteins in cancer cells
and determining whether AHA1 is involved in cellular sensitivity to
17-AAG is therefore of great interest.

Cancer Research

We hypothesized that modulation of AHA1 expression could
affect the activity of HSP90 and influence the response of cancer
cells to 17-AAG. We have used both overexpression and small
interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown models to alter AHA1 protein
expression in cancer cells. We show that modulation of AHA1
levels could alter the activity of representative HSP90 client
proteins and the phosphorylation status of key signaling proteins
MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and AKT without affecting the total levels of
these proteins or of the client proteins C-RAF, ERBB2, or CDK4. We
also show that the depletion of AHA1 increases cellular sensitivity
to 17-AAG. The results suggest that AHA1 is involved in regulating
the activation status, but not the stability, of several signal
transduction proteins and also indicate that AHA1 levels may play
a role in cellular response to HSP90 inhibitors. In addition, our
findings support the consideration of targeting AHA1 as a potential
therapeutic strategy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Human cancer cell lines were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (LGC Promochem). All lines were grown in DMEM
(Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with 10% (FCS; Invitrogen), 2 mmol/L
of L-glutamine, and 1 nonessential amino acids in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37jC. All lines were free of Mycoplasma (VenorGeM
mycoplasm PCR detection kit; Minerva Biolabs).
Transfection with siRNA oligos. The siRNA oligos were synthesized
by Dharmacon Research, Inc. The siRNA oligos corresponded to
nucleotides 390 to 409 and 428 to 446 of the human AHA1 coding region
(GenBank accession no: XM_012111). Controls were designed with the
central 4 bp of the active oligo sequences inverted. To minimize off-target
effects, all sequences were BLAST-searched against the human genome
sequence to ensure V75% homology matches to other genes. HSF-1 oligos
used were the siGENOME smartpool M-012109-00 (Dharmacon Research).
Oligos were transfected into HCT116 human colon cancer cells using
oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Cell growth inhibition studies. The sulforhodamine B assay (SRB) was
used as described (35). The IC50 was calculated as the drug concentration
that inhibited cell growth by 50% compared with vehicle controls (<0.1%
DMSO).
Western blotting. Protein extraction, Western blotting, and antibodies
used are described in the Supplementary Data.
Kinase assays. C-RAF (Upstate) and AKT (Cell Signaling Technology,
Inc.) immunoprecipitation-kinase assay kits were used as described in the
Supplementary Data. The resultant immunoprecipitated client-chaperone
complexes were analyzed by Western blotting.
Morphologic analysis. Cells transfected with siRNA oligos were
incubated with 1 mg/mL of RNase A and 1 mg/mL of propidium iodide
for 30 min at 37jC. Samples were mounted on microscope slides and
images collected using a Leica SP confocal microscope (Leica).
Vector construction and transfection. A derivative of the biscistronic
plasmid vector pEFIRES-P (36) known as F1005 was used to express the
open reading frame of AHA1 (14), kindly provided by Dr. Chris Prodromou,
The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom (Fig. S1). The
resultant AHA1-containing F1007 vector or the empty vector F1005 were
transfected into the HCT116 and HT29 colon cancer cell lines using the
cationic liposome-mediated transfection (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxyl)propyl]NNN-trimethylammoniummethyl sulfate) method (Roche Diagnostics) as
described in the Supplementary Data.
Statistical analysis. The single-factor ANOVA test was used to compare
the IC50 values determined by SRB assay. Paired t tests were used for the
statistical analysis of data from cell-counting experiments combining siRNA
against AHA1 and 17-AAG treatment. In all analyses, P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Pearson’s correlation was used to
compare basal AHA1 expression and IC50 values.

Results
Differential expression of AHA1 and sensitivity to 17-AAG in
human cancer cell lines. A panel of human cancer cell lines
including five different tumor types was selected for initial analysis.
Constitutive protein expression of AHA1, HSP90, and HSP72 was
determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). There were reproducible
differences (three independent repeats) in the expression of all
three proteins across the various cancer cell lines. However, there
was no obvious relationship between the levels of AHA1 and those
of HSP90 and HSP72. For example, the HT29 and HCT116 colon
cancer cell lines express high levels of HSP72, but the former
exhibits low expression of AHA1, whereas the latter has high levels.
Similar differences can be seen in the melanoma and ovarian
cancer lines (Fig. 1A).
The IC50 values for 17-AAG in these cancer cell lines, as
determined in the NCI60 cell line panel,1 were compared with the
relative basal levels of AHA1 as measured by densitometry. There
was no correlation between sensitivity to 17-AAG and basal AHA1
protein expression (r 2 = 0.00002448, P = 0.9878). These results
suggest that AHA1 expression alone does not explain the sensitivity
to 17-AAG. This is not surprising as many factors are involved in
the response to HSP90 inhibitors (37), including the expression of
other heat shock proteins and cochaperones such as HSP72 and
HSP27 (37). To control for the effects of other factors, we therefore
investigated the role of AHA1 in isogenic overexpression and
knockdown models (see below).
Induction of AHA1 by 17-AAG via HSF-1. A smaller group
of human cancer cell lines, i.e., HCT116 (colon), HT29 (colon),
and A2780 (ovarian) cells, were selected for further studies based
on their different levels of constitutive AHA1 and HSP90
expression (Fig. 1A). When HCT116 cells were treated with 5
IC50 of 17-AAG (108 nmol/L) over 96 h, AHA1 was induced as
early as 8 h and remained up-regulated at 96 h when compared
with control cells (Fig. 1B). A rapid induction of HSP72 and a
depletion of C-RAF were also observed, consistent with the
molecular signature of HSP90 inhibition (34). Recovery of C-RAF
was seen, and in some experiments (e.g., Fig. 1B), expression at
72 and 96 h was higher than at baseline. Treatment of HT29 and
A2780 cells with 17-AAG resulted in similar AHA1 induction to
that seen in HCT116 cells (data not shown). Interestingly,
however, nontumorigenic PNT2 human prostate epithelial cells
did not show the induction of AHA1 expression when treated
with an equimolar concentration of 17-AAG over 96 h, although
HSP72 was induced and C-RAF depleted followed by recovery
(Fig. 1C).
The AHA1 gene contains heat shock element (HSE) sites in its
promoter (14), suggesting that the induction observed in cancer
cells could be regulated by HSF-1. Consistent with this hypothesis,
siRNA knockdown of HSF-1 in both A2780 (Fig. 1D) and HCT116
cells (Fig. S2) resulted in decreased AHA1, HSP72, and HSP27
induction following 17-AAG treatment, with no effect on the levels
of these proteins in the vehicle-treated controls.
Increased expression of AHA1 enhances the phosphorylation of signal transduction proteins. A stable AHA1 overexpression model was successfully developed in the HT29 cell line,
which has low constitutive levels of AHA1 (Fig. 1A). The resultant
clones had significantly increased AHA1 expression compared

AHA1 Knockdown Increases Sensitivity to 17-AAG

Figure 1. Constitutive expression of AHA1 and molecular effects of 17-AAG on protein expression. A, representative Western blot of constitutive AHA1, HSP90,
and HSP72 protein expression levels in a panel of human cancer cell lines. Levels shown were reproducible in three independent repeats. B, HCT116 human colon
cancer cells were treated with 108 nmol/L of 17-AAG over a time course of 96 h. C, PNT2 nontumorigenic human prostate epithelial cells were treated with 108 nmol/L
of 17-AAG over a time course of 96 h. D, A2780 human ovarian cancer cells were transfected with HSF-1 siRNA oligos, nonspecific control oligos, or were
mock-transfected. Twenty-four hours after the transfections, the cells were treated with 5 IC50 17-AAG (60 nmol/L). HSF-1, AHA1, C-RAF, HSP72, and HSP27 levels
were detected by Western blotting. GAPDH was included as loading control in all experiments.

with the parental HT29 cell line, as detected by Western blotting
(Fig. 2A). The empty vector control clones (E and H) had levels of
AHA1 expression similar to those of the parental cell line (Fig. 2A).
Clones 2 and 3 with f10-fold and 3.5-fold more AHA1 than
parental HT29 cells, respectively, were selected for further investigation. There was no significant difference in growth rates between
parental, empty vector, and overexpressing cells, with doubling
times of f24 h in all cases (data not shown). Overexpression of
AHA1 did not affect the levels of HSP90 or the commonly studied
client proteins C-RAF or CDK4 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, however,
there was an increase in the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and
ERK1/2 in the AHA1-overexpressing HT29 clones 2 and 3 compared
with the parental and empty vector controls, but no change in the
total levels of these proteins (Fig. 2B). The extent of phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 was in proportion with the degree of
overexpression of AHA1 in the two clones.
Next, we investigated the possible cause of the increased MEK1/
2 and ERK1/2 activation seen with overexpression of AHA1.
Following immunoprecipitation of C-RAF from the AHA1-overexpressing HT29 cells, we showed increased kinase activity of
C-RAF, using recombinant MEK1 as a substrate, compared with
the empty vector controls (Fig. 2C), providing an explanation for
the enhanced phosphorylation of the downstream kinases. The
immunoprecipitated complex in which the activated C-RAF was
present was associated with increased levels of AHA1 but similar

www.aacrjournals.org

levels of HSP90 compared with the control. Thus, the results
suggest that the enhanced C-RAF activation is due to the greater
level of AHA1 present in the immunoprecipitated HSP90/C-RAF
complex, resulting in increased MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the cell.
The activation of another HSP90 client protein was investigated.
Phosphorylation of AKT was relatively difficult to detect in HT29
cells. However, Fig. 2D shows that in HCT116 cells overexpressing
AHA1, there was an increase in phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473
with no change in total AKT or of the 3-phosphoinositide–
dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) that phosphorylates AKT. The
AKT immunoprecipitated from the AHA1-overexpressing HCT116
cells was shown to have increased kinase activity using
recombinant GSK3h as a substrate (Fig. 2C). The immunoprecipitated activated AKT complex contained higher levels of AHA1
but similar levels of HSP90 compared with the control in an
analogous way to the result noted above for activated C-RAF.
Because there was no change in PDK1 expression, it could be
hypothesized that PDK1 activity may also be increased with AHA1
overexpression, leading to greater AKT phosphorylation and
activation.
Taken together, the results indicate that overexpression of AHA1
increases the phosphorylation of the signal transduction proteins
MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and AKT in the cell, without affecting the
respective total protein levels. This was explained by the increased

association of AHA1 with the HSP90/client protein complex,
resulting in enhanced kinase activity of C-RAF and AKT.
Increased expression of AHA1 does not affect cellular
sensitivity to 17-AAG. Next, the effects of AHA1 overexpression
on the cellular sensitivity of HT29 cells to 17-AAG was evaluated by
SRB assay. Expression of AHA1, HSP72, and representative client
proteins C-RAF and CDK4 was also determined by Western
blotting. The higher levels of AHA1 in the overexpressing clones
compared with the controls were maintained but not obviously
further induced following treatment with 17-AAG (Fig. 3).
Depletion of C-RAF and CDK4 together with up-regulation of
HSP72 confirmed the same molecular signature of HSP90
inhibition by 17-AAG in both AHA1-overexpressing and control
cells. Table 1 shows that increased expression of AHA1 had no
significant effect on the sensitivity of HT29 cells to 17-AAG
(ANOVA, P > 0.05). In addition, no difference was seen in the

sensitivity to 17-AAG of HCT116 cells overexpressing AHA1 when
compared with the empty vector controls (P > 0.05; Table 1).
siRNA knockdown of AHA1 decreases the phosphorylation
of signal transduction proteins. To complement the overexpression studies, an siRNA knockdown approach was also used.
The effects of two different 21-mer oligonucleotides that were
designed to target distinct regions of the AHA1 sequence were
determined in HCT116 cells, which have relatively high constitutive
AHA1 levels (Fig. 1A). The active siRNA oligonucleotides [oligo 1
(O1) and oligo 2 (O2)] successfully knocked down >80% of AHA1
protein expression, as measured by Western blotting and
densitometry, at 48 and 72 h posttransfection (Fig. 4A). Controls
were designed for each of the active oligos with a 4 bp central
invert (IC1 and IC2). Mock-transfected (control 1) and lipid-free
transfected (control 2) controls were also included. The control
oligos and transfection controls had no effect on AHA1 expression

Figure 2. Overexpression of AHA1 protein and effects on the expression and activation status of selected proteins in human cancer cells. AHA1 protein expression was
detected using Western blotting. A, HT29 human colon cancer clones expressing the F1007 vector containing the AHA1 open reading frame (clones 1–10 ) and
HT29 clones expressing the empty vector F1005 (E and H ). Parental HT29 cell line (WT) was also included. His-tagged recombinant AHA1 protein produced in bacteria
(rAHA1 ) was included as a positive control; the different mobilities were due to the His-tag. B, wild-type HT29 cells and selected HT29 clones transfected with
either the overexpression vector F1007 (2 and 3) or empty vector control clones (E and H ) were harvested and the constitutive levels of C-RAF, CDK4, phosphorylated
MEK1/2 and total MEK2, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 and total ERK2 were assayed by Western blotting. C, selected HT29 and HCT116-overexpressing clones
and empty vector controls were used to assay C-RAF and AKT kinase activity, respectively, using immunoprecipitation kinase assays. Immunoprecipitated C-RAF
kinase activity was measured by the extent of phosphorylation of an inactive MEK1 protein; C-RAF acted as a loading control. Recombinant C-RAF protein (rRAF ) was
included as a positive control. Immunoprecipitated AKT kinase activity was measured by the extent of phosphorylation of inactive GSK3h protein; AKT acted as a
loading control. AHA1 and HSP90 were also determined using the corresponding antibodies. D, wild-type HCT116 human colon cancer cells and selected HCT116
clones transfected with either the overexpression vector F1007 (C, G, and N) or empty vector control clones (2 and 3) were harvested and the constitutive levels of
HSP90, PDK1, phosphorylated AKT, and total AKT were assayed by Western blotting. GAPDH was included as loading control.

Figure 3. Effect of AHA1 overexpression on
molecular marker changes in response
to the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG in HT29 human
colon cancer cells. HT29 parental cells and cells
transfected with either the AHA1 overexpression
vector F1007 or the empty vector control were treated
with isoeffective concentrations of 17-AAG, either
60 or 120 nmol/L, corresponding to 10 and 20 IC50
(Table 1), and harvested at 24 h. Control cells
were treated with vehicle alone (V). AHA1, C-RAF,
CDK4, and HSP72 protein expression was measured
using Western blotting. GAPDH was included
as loading control.

at 48 or 72 h (Fig. 4A), indicating that the silencing of AHA1 was a
specific effect of the targeted siRNA oligos. The selectivity of the
siRNA oligonucleotides was also shown by the fact there was no
effect on the expression of HSP90, HSP72 (Fig. 4A), or cochaperones CDC37 or P23 (data not shown).
In addition to having no effect on other chaperones and
cochaperones (see previous paragraph), knocking down AHA1
protein expression over a 72-h time course also had no effect on the
levels of client proteins C-RAF, CDK4, or ERBB2 (Fig. 4A). However,
a decrease in the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 proteins
was observed when AHA1 was knocked down, with no change in the
levels of total MEK2 or ERK2 (Fig. 4B). In addition, a reduction in
the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated C-RAF was also observed
in the cells with decreased AHA1 (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the
immunoprecipitated complex with the less active C-RAF contained
a decreased level of AHA1 but comparable levels of C-RAF and
HSP90 compared with the controls (Fig. 4C). Taken together with
the overexpression data, which gave the entirely complementary
result (Fig. 2C), these data suggest that AHA1 is involved in
regulating the activation status, but not the stability of signal
transduction proteins such as C-RAF and AKT.
siRNA knockdown of AHA1 increases the cellular sensitivity
to 17-AAG. siRNA knockdown of AHA1 in HCT116 cells treated

with 5 IC50 17-AAG for 48 h resulted in significantly greater
sensitivity to 17-AAG, as shown by a 2- to 3-fold increase in
detached cells when compared with both inactive inverted controls
and mock-transfected controls (P < 0.05; Fig. 5A). Similar results
were obtained in the A2780 ovarian cell line in which the increase
in detached cells was 3- to 6-fold (P < 0.02; Fig. S3). The cellular
sensitivity following AHA1 depletion evaluated by SRB assay
showed a significant decrease in IC50 value with the active oligos
compared with all the controls (ANOVA, P < 0.05; Fig. 5B). The
results suggest that when AHA1 levels become limiting, cellular
sensitivity to HSP90 inhibition by 17-AAG is increased.
Western blotting was used to assess the expression of relevant
proteins under the same experimental conditions as the sensitivity
studies. Knockdown of AHA1 was confirmed in samples transfected
with the active siRNA oligos, with no detectable change in any of
the control samples (Fig. 5C). Cells treated with 17-AAG also
showed an induction of HSP72 and depletion of C-RAF regardless
of AHA1 silencing. Of note, the siRNA against AHA1 completely
blocked the induction of AHA1, as well as reducing the endogenous
expression (Fig. 5C).
Figure 5D shows that nuclear fragmentation, which is indicative
of apoptosis, was observed in all the detached cell populations but
not in the attached cells. Western blotting also showed PARP

Figure 4. Effects of AHA1 knockdown by siRNA on client proteins in HCT116 colon cancer cells. HCT116 human colon cancer cells were transfected with either
active siRNA oligos against AHA1 (O1 and O2 ) or the inverted control oligos (IC1 and IC2) or were mock transfected (C1 ). A, 48 and 72 h after transfection,
the constitutive levels of AHA1, HSP90, HSP72, C-RAF, CDK4, and ERBB2 were assayed by Western blotting. B, 56 h after transfection, the levels of AHA1,
C-RAF, phosphorylated MEK1/2 and total MEK2, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 and total ERK2 were assayed by Western blotting. GAPDH was included as a loading
control in A and B. C, the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated C-RAF was assayed in HCT116 cells transfected with either an active (O1 ) or inactive oligo (IC1)
or mock-transfected control cells. Immunoprecipitated C-RAF kinase activity was measured by the extent of phosphorylation of an inactive MEK1 protein; C-RAF
acted as a loading control. AHA1 and HSP90 present in the complex with C-RAF were determined with the appropriate antibodies.

cleavage in the detached but not in the attached cells (Fig. 5C).
Cleaved PARP was present in a small number of detached cells in
the control population, indicating a low endogenous level of
apoptosis (f2.5% detached cells). Figure 5A shows a statistically
significant 2- to 3-fold increase to 7% detached apoptotic cells after
siRNA knockdown of AHA1 (P < 0.05). Thus, the increase in cell
sensitivity to 17-AAG caused by a reduction in AHA1 expression,
as measured by SRB assay, was accompanied by an increase in
apoptosis.

Discussion
In conjunction with its cochaperones, which operate together in
a chaperone cycle, HSP90 is involved in chaperoning a large array
of client proteins.2 As well as controlling the stabilization/
degradation balance for client proteins, HSP90 maintains its
clients in conformational states that facilitate activation events,
such as ligand binding and phosphorylation, and thereby regulates
signal transduction (2). ATP hydrolysis by HSP90 is important to
drive the chaperone cycle and to enable controlled chaperone
function (21). Changes in the conformation of HSP90 and in the
binding of cochaperones have been reported to affect the rate of
hydrolysis, depending on the stage of the cycle (22, 38). For
example, CDC37 binds to the NH2-terminal domain of HSP90 in
the early complex state, causing steric hindrance of the NH2terminal ATP binding site to facilitate client protein loading
(16, 39). AHA1, however, binds to the middle domain of HSP90 (40).
Structural studies of yeast Aha1 indicate that upon binding to
Hsp90, Aha1 facilitates a conformational switch in the g-phosphate
binding loop of Hsp90 (41). The switch from the retracted and
inactive state to the extended conformation of this loop enables
the catalytic Arg380 residue in the yeast Aha1 to access the ATP
bound to the NH2-terminal of yeast Hsp90, resulting in increased
ATPase activity (14, 40).

Although regulation of the ATPase cycle of HSP90 by its
cochaperones is well defined, the current understanding of how the
ATPase cycle of HSP90 is coupled to activation and/or stabilization
of its client proteins in the cell is very limited. To gain greater
insight into the role of AHA1 in human cancer cells and to
investigate its potential therapeutic effect, the present studies have
focused on two aspects of AHA1 biology and pharmacology. First,
we looked at the effect of manipulating the levels of AHA1 in
cancer cells on the activity of HSP90, as determined by client
protein levels and the phosphorylation status of key signaling
proteins that lie on oncogenic pathways downstream of representative oncogenic client proteins. Second, we determined the effects
of altering AHA1 levels on the cellular sensitivity to the first-inclass HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG, which is currently in phase 2 clinical
trials (33).
Initial investigation of the relationship between the basal
expression of AHA1 in several human cancer cell lines showed
that a range of levels were present. However, there was no obvious
relationship between the levels of AHA1 and the expression of
HSP90 and the cochaperone HSP72. Furthermore, there was no
correlation between basal expression of AHA1 and sensitivity to
17-AAG. This is not surprising as many genes and proteins affect
sensitivity to HSP90 inhibitors such as 17-AAG (37). For example,
the levels of the antiapoptotic heat shock protein and cochaperone
HSP72 affect 17-AAG sensitivity (42), and we show here that AHA1
and HSP72 levels are not related (Fig. 1A). Based on constitutive
AHA1 expression levels, HT29 and HCT116 human colon cancer
cell lines, together with A2780 human ovarian cancer cells, were
selected for further investigation. HT29 cells had the lowest
expression of AHA1 in the panel, whereas HCT116 and A2780
represent lines with relatively high levels (Fig. 1A).
When the function of HSP90 is impaired by pharmacologic
inhibition of the chaperone’s intrinsic ATPase activity, the role of
HSP90 shifts from stabilization to degradation, resulting in a
depletion of the client protein via the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway (43). Interestingly, despite its role in the activation of

HSP90 ATPase activity (14), our results show that siRNA
knockdown of AHA1 by f80% had no effect on the expression
of the representative HSP90 client proteins C-RAF, ERBB2, or CDK4
in HCT116 cancer cells (Fig. 4). In addition, overexpression of AHA1
by 3.5- to 10-fold had no effect on the expression of these HSP90
client proteins (Fig. 2B). The results suggest that AHA1 is not
essential for the stabilization of the kinase clients investigated.
Intriguingly, however, our results show that modulation of AHA1
does affect the phosphorylation and activation of important
oncogenic signal transduction proteins in cancer cells. Thus, we
have shown that siRNA knockdown of AHA1 in HCT116 cancer
cells results in a decrease in phosphorylated, activated forms of
MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 which could be explained by a reduction in
the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated C-RAF, but no change
in the total amounts of any of these proteins (Fig. 4). In complementary studies in HT29 cancer cells, overexpression of AHA1
resulted in an increase in the phosphorylated forms of MEK1/2
and ERK1/2 associated with an increase in the kinase activity of
immunoprecipitated C-RAF, again with no change in the total
amounts of the corresponding proteins (Fig. 2B and C). Taken
together, the siRNA knockdown and overexpression data are
consistent with a model in which AHA1 plays a role in regulating
the ERK1/2 pathway by modulating C-RAF activity, but without
affecting the amount of HSP90 client proteins. Further evidence
that AHA1 may be involved in client protein activation rather than
stability was provided by the observed increase in AKT phosphorylation and immunoprecipitated AKT catalytic activity when AHA1
was overexpressed in HCT116 cells, once more with no change in
the corresponding total protein level (Fig. 2C). Because the total
levels of PDK1 were also unchanged (Fig. 2D), the results suggest
that the activity of this AKT-activating kinase may also be
increased by AHA1 overexpression.
To investigate the potential mechanism by which AHA1
modulation affected the activation of the client proteins C-RAF
and AKT, we carried out immunoprecipitation experiments to
determine the amount of AHA1 that was associated the respective
client protein-HSP90 complex. The results showed that less AHA1
was associated with client protein in the siRNA knockdown model
whereas more AHA1 was associated with C-RAF and AKT in the
overexpression model (Figs. 2C and 4C). In contrast, the amount of
HSP90 associated with client proteins was constant. These results
therefore support a model in which AHA1 regulates the activation
status of C-RAF and AKT, but is not required, or is needed to a
lesser extent, for the stability of these client proteins.
Previous studies have suggested that AHA1 may increase the
activity of the glucocorticoid receptor, which is a non–kinase client
protein, as measured by a reporter gene assay in both W303 yeast
cells and HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cells (44). Furthermore, using cellular phosphotyrosine profiling in yeast, a decrease
in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins by V-SRC was observed
when the Aha1 gene was deleted in yeast (14). Taken together, the
results suggest that AHA1 may operate in the cell not to regulate
the balance of stabilization versus degradation of client proteins,
but rather, to control the activity of certain client proteins.
It is likely, although not definitively proven, that the activation of
client proteins occurs via the stimulation of HSP90’s ATPase
activity in the HSP90/AHA1/client protein complex. On the other
hand, we cannot rule out alternative or additional effects of AHA1.
However, because activation of HSP90 ATPase activity is the only
known biochemical function of AHA1, we propose that this is the
most likely hypothesis to explain the findings.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (4). February 15, 2008

The results we have seen here with the modulation of AHA1
expression are different from those seen in equivalent studies with
other HSP90 cochaperones in cancer cells. Thus, knockdown of
HSP72 and HSC70 in the same HCT116 cell model resulted in
decreased expression of client proteins C-RAF, CDK4, and ERBB2,3
an effect not seen with AHA1 silencing. In addition, knockdown of
CDC37 in these models also resulted in decreased expression of
kinase client proteins C-RAF and CDK4.4 Further studies are
required to investigate the effects of the large number of additional
HSP90 cochaperones.
The first-in-class HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG binds to the NH2terminal ATP pocket of HSP90, thus inhibiting its activity (29).
Treatment with this drug has been shown to cause cell cycle
arrest and cytostasis in adherent cell populations, with a
concomitant increase in detached apoptotic cells (45). In the
present study, we showed that when HCT116 colon cancer cells
were treated with 17-AAG, the levels of AHA1 protein were
elevated (Fig. 1B). This was also observed with A2780 ovarian
cancer cells (46) and HT29 colon cancer cells (data not shown).
Interestingly, AHA1 induction was not observed in the nontumorigenic human prostate cell line PNT2 at equivalent drug
concentrations, although HSP72 was induced and client proteins
depleted (Fig. 1C). Malignant cells are known to be more
dependent on HSP90 due to the oncogenic stress and microenvironmental conditions found in tumors (47). As a result,
HSP90 is present with its cochaperones in superchaperone
complexes in cancer but not ‘‘normal’’ cells (48). HSP90 inhibitors
can bind with higher affinity to these superchaperone complexes,
providing an explanation for the therapeutic window observed
between normal and tumor cells (48), and the decreased
induction of stress-regulated proteins, as observed here for
AHA1.
It is well established that induction of HSP72 occurs at the
mRNA and protein level in response to HSP90 inhibitors (49). In
stressed cells, heat shock proteins are up-regulated to protect
the cell from unfavorable conditions by preventing protein aggregation, aiding protein folding, and supporting protein trafficking
(47). For stress-induced transcription to occur, activation of
HSF-1 is required, which once phosphorylated, can bind to
HSEs in the promoters of heat shock protein genes (47). HSEs
are characterized as multiple tandem inverted repeats of the
short consensus sequence 5¶-nGAAn-3¶ (50). The yeast Aha1
promoter contains three HSEs (14, 51) and both yeast and
human genes are induced when cells are exposed to heat shock
(14). Further confirmation that HSF-1 regulates the induction of
AHA1 was provided by our demonstration of decreased induction of AHA1 after treatment of HCT116 human colon cancer
cells with 17-AAG when HSF-1 levels were depleted by siRNA
(Fig. 1D). The present studies show that induction of AHA1
by 17-AAG is less extensive than is seen with HSP72, which
contains four HSEs in its promoter (52). Nevertheless, despite
the more limited response to 17-AAG compared with HSP72, the
induction of the HSP90-activating protein AHA1 could potentially represent a protective mechanism for the cancer cell
through the activation of HSP90 and potentially other unknown
mechanisms. We show here that siRNA to AHA1 decreased basal

AHA1 Knockdown Increases Sensitivity to 17-AAG

expression and completely blocked its induction by 17-AAG,
without affecting client protein expression levels. Furthermore,
we also developed overexpression models for AHA1 in both low
and high basal expression cancer cell lines. We therefore investigated the effect of modulating AHA1 on the sensitivity of cancer
cells to 17-AAG.
Overexpression of AHA1 did not significantly (P > 0.05) affect
the sensitivity to the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG in either of the two
human colon cancer cell lines tested (HT29 and HCT116).
Importantly, however, depletion of AHA1 by siRNA increased the
sensitivity of cancer cells to 17-AAG (Fig. 5A). HCT116 colon
cancer cells showed a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the
number of detached apoptotic cells (2- to 3-fold) after 17-AAG
treatment when AHA1 was depleted (Fig. 5A). These detached
cells were shown to be apoptotic by morphology (nuclear
fragmentation) and the appearance of cleaved PARP (Fig. 5C
and D), as distinct from the corresponding attached cells which
had normal morphology and intact PARP (Fig. 5C and D). This
significant sensitization to 17-AAG, as a result of AHA1 depletion,
was also observed to an even greater extent (3- to 6-fold) in the
A2780 ovarian cancer cell line (P < 0.02; Fig. S3). A corresponding
increase in sensitivity to 17-AAG was observed in the SRB growth
inhibition assay in HCT116 cells after AHA1 levels had been
depleted (P < 0.05; Fig. 5). The SRB assay is sensitive to drug
effects on cell number via apoptosis and other mechanisms,
including cytostasis. Our previous detailed studies have shown
that 17-AAG exhibits both apoptotic and cytostatic (cell cycle
arrest) effects in HCT116 cells (45). Further studies are required
to dissect out the precise contributions of changes in apoptosis
and cytostasis to the increased sensitivity of cancer cells to 17AAG following AHA1 knockdown. These studies could include the
analysis of additional apoptotic markers in the adherent
population of treated cells. It is, however, clear that AHA1 does
increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to 17-AAG, as measured
either by the SRB assay or by apoptosis biomarkers. The fact that
depletion of AHA1 by f80% increases the sensitivity of cancer
cells to 17-AAG, whereas overexpression does not affect the
sensitivity, indicates that expression above a certain threshold
has no further effect on cellular responsiveness to HSP90
inhibition.
The precise molecular mechanism by which depletion of AHA1
sensitizes cells to HSP90 inhibition remains to be established.
The effect is not mediated by a direct effect on HSP90-dependent
stabilization of kinase clients because levels of C-RAF, ERBB2,
and CDK4 were not depleted further by AHA1 knockdown as
compared with the effect of 17-AAG alone (Fig. 4). The protective
effect of AHA1 may relate to the ability we have identified for
this cochaperone to activate the ERK1/2 mitogen-activated
protein kinase and AKT signal transduction pathways that
regulate cell survival. Alternatively, or in addition, the protective
effects of AHA1 could occur via similar effects on other kinases
or ligand-activated clients. Published studies investigating the
Hsp90 complex in yeast have shown that mutations which
disrupt the binding of cochaperones to the complex or depletion
of a cochaperone can increase sensitivity to the HSP90 inhibitor
geldanamycin (53, 54). In particular, loss of the yeast cochaperone Sti1 (the functional equivalent of the mammalian HOP)
resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity to geldanamycin.
HOP has been reported to displace geldanamycin from the
HSP90-inhibitor complex (55). Depletion of Sti1/HOP would
prevent this from occurring, which could explain the increased

www.aacrjournals.org

drug sensitivity. Mutational analysis of Hsp90 in yeast has also
shown that certain key mutations could increase the sensitivity
to geldanamycin and radicicol. Of note, a mutation in Hsp90
which dramatically reduced the in vitro ATPase activity of the
purified protein was shown to cause significantly increased
sensitivity to geldanamycin (54). Furthermore, the cochaperone
cyclophilin 40 (CyP40), another component of the Hsp90
chaperone complex which can (to a more limited extent than
Aha1) increase the ATPase activity of Hsp90 (14), has also been
shown to affect the sensitivity of yeast to geldanamycin. CyP40
has two functional homologues in yeast, Cpr6 and Cpr7. Yeast
strains lacking Cpr7 are reported to be hypersensitive to
geldanamycin (53). Together with the results presented here,
these data suggest that the levels of cochaperones may affect the
cellular sensitivity to HSP90 inhibitors and that modulation of
HSP90 ATPase activity via interactions with various cochaperones that affect this activity may in turn affect therapeutic
responses to HSP90 inhibitors.
A model can be suggested to explain our observations that
depletion of AHA1 increases sensitivity to 17-AAG whereas
overexpression has no effect. We propose that the induction of
AHA1, upon treatment with 17-AAG, represents a protective
mechanism within the cell which increases HSP90 activity and
limits the effects of the inhibitor. According to this model, the
maximum protective effect that AHA1 can have in the cell has
already been achieved by the extent of AHA1 induction seen upon
treatment with 17-AAG. Therefore, no additional protective benefit
to the cells is obtained by artificially overexpressing AHA1.
However, when AHA1 levels are reduced by siRNA, the protective
response is attenuated, resulting in the observed increase in
sensitivity to 17-AAG. Our results support the consideration of
potential therapeutic approaches to enhance the activity of HSP90
inhibitors either by depleting AHA1, for example, by RNA
interference, or by identifying small molecule inhibitors of the
HSP90-AHA1 interaction (56). It is important to note, however,
that care will have to be taken to determine the effect of AHA1
depletion in malignant versus normal cells. We believe that this
will best be determined in the context of the whole animal.
However, there is potential for therapeutic selectivity towards
malignant cells based on their greater dependence on HSP90, the
much higher proportion of HSP90 that is present with cochaperones in a superchaperone complex, and the increased sensitivity
to 17-AAG of this chaperone complex that is present in cancer
cells (48).
In summary, our results show that modulation of the levels of
the HSP90 ATPase–activating protein AHA1 affects the activation
status of client proteins and that depletion of AHA1 could
increase cellular sensitivity to the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG.
Because HSP90 inhibitors continue to show promise in early
clinical trials, this work should stimulate further research into
AHA1.
