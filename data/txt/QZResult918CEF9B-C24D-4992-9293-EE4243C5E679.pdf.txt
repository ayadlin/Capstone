Abstract
B1 Integrin signaling has been shown to mediate cellular
resistance to apoptosis after exposure to ionizing radiation
(IR). Other signaling molecules that increase resistance
include Akt, which promotes cell survival downstream of B1
integrin signaling. We previously showed that B1 integrin
inhibitory antibodies (e.g., AIIB2) enhance apoptosis and
decrease growth in human breast cancer cells in threedimensional laminin-rich extracellular matrix (lrECM) cultures and in vivo. Here, we asked whether AIIB2 could
synergize with IR to modify Akt-mediated IR resistance. We
used three-dimensional lrECM cultures to test the optimal
combination of AIIB2 with IR treatment of two breast cancer
cell lines, MCF-7 and HMT3522-T4-2, as well as T4-2 myr-Akt
breast cancer colonies or HMT3522-S-1, which form normal
organotypic structures in three-dimensional lrECM. Colonies
were assayed for apoptosis and B1 integrin/Akt signaling
pathways were evaluated using Western blot. In addition, mice
bearing MCF-7 xenografts were used to validate the findings in
three-dimensional lrECM. We report that AIIB2 increased
apoptosis optimally post-IR by down-regulating Akt in breast
cancer colonies in three-dimensional lrECM. In vivo, addition
of AIIB2 after IR significantly enhanced tumor growth
inhibition and apoptosis compared with either treatment
alone. Remarkably, the degree of tumor growth inhibition
using AIIB2 plus 2 Gy radiation was similar to that of 8 Gy
alone. We previously showed that AIIB2 had no discernible
toxicity in mice; here, its addition allowed for a significant
reduction in the IR dose that was necessary to achieve
comparable growth inhibition and apoptosis in breast cancer
xenografts in vivo. [Cancer Res 2008;68(11):4398–405]

Introduction
Radiation therapy is an effective modality used for breast cancer
treatment; however, tumor resistance and recurrences remain
significant clinical problems (1). Increasing evidence indicates that
in addition to DNA damage, multiple cellular mechanisms such as
cell interactions with neighboring cells and the microenvironment
fundamentally influence cell fate in response to ionizing radiation
(IR; ref. 2). Indeed, single doses of IR to single cells could modify
cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions and
confer heritable epigenetic traits (3).

Adhesion to ECM has long been known to modify radiation
sensitivity in several cell types, including cancer. Integrins, a major
class of transmembrane molecules that mediate adhesion and cellECM interactions, are aberrantly expressed in many cancer cell
types and are up-regulated post-IR (4, 5). In particular, h1 integrins
have been found to be up-regulated by clinically relevant doses of
IR in cancer cell lines (4) and in human mammary epithelial cells in
three-dimensional laminin-rich extracellular matrix (lrECM) cultures (3, 5). h1 integrins have been implicated in mediating
resistance to IR (6–10). However, the role of h1 integrins as a
strategic molecular target in conjunction with IR has not been fully
investigated.
h1 Integrins belong to a family of heterodimeric receptors whose
ligands are arginine-glycine-aspartic acid–containing ECM molecules (11). Acting largely as mechanoreceptors, h1 integrins
transmit biochemical cues that can facilitate multiple cellular
fates downstream, including apoptosis and survival (12). Increase
in h1 integrins seem to enhance cancer cell viability by promoting
survival and confer resistance to chemotherapy in several tumor
cell types (10, 13, 14). In addition, we have shown previously that in
a subset of patients with early-stage breast cancer, high h1 integrin
expression is associated with poor overall survival, indicating that
this subgroup of patients may benefit from more aggressive and
targeted therapy (15).
Cancer cell resistance to IR has been shown previously to be
mediated via Akt, a serine threonine kinase that lies immediately
downstream of phoshatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and the
integrin signaling pathways (16, 17). h1 integrin has been shown
to enhance cancer cell survival via the PI3K pathway in lung cancer
(10) and in normal fibroblasts (18) in culture. We have shown
previously that h1 integrin inhibitory antibodies selectively induce
apoptosis in breast cancer cells but not nonmalignant acini in
three-dimensional lrECM cultures; these findings were validated
in vivo with no toxicity to animals (19), indicating that h1 integrin
is a highly promising therapeutic target. In this report, we used the
three-dimensional lrECM assay and in vivo models of breast cancer
to test the hypothesis that h1 integrins may facilitate IR-induced
resistance by promoting Akt-mediated survival.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Nonmalignant human mammary epithelial cells, HMT-3522
(S-1), were originally derived from a woman with fibrocystic breast disease
(20), and were cultured in H14 medium (21). S-1 cells were propagated on
plastic in medium containing 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF).
Also derived from the same parental line, malignant HMT-3522 (T4-2) cells
were propagated on collagen type I–coated flasks in the absence of EGF
(21). T4-2 wild-type cells that were either stably transfected with a
constitutively active myristoylated Akt (T4-2 myr-Akt) or empty vector
control (T4-2 vc) were a gift from Hong Liu [University of California San
Francisco (UCSF)]. Human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, was obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection. Three-dimensional lrECM

cultures consisted of cells trypsinized from monolayer cultures and plated
on top of commercially available gel produced from Englebreth-HolmSwarm tumors (Matrigel; BD Sciences). Cell lines were maintained in H 14
medium as described previously (19) and transferred to the modified threedimensional lrECM assay (19). This is referred to as day 0. Cultures were
exposed to IR and/or AIIB2 on day 6 of culture after acinar formation for
nonmalignant S1 cells and on days 4 and 5 of culture, sequentially for
malignant cell lines. AIIB2 was added to culture medium on alternate days.
All cultures were analyzed 72 h after the first treatment.
AIIB2. h1 Integrin function-blocking antibody, clone AIIB2, was originally
a purchased gift from Carolyn Damsky (UCSF). AIIB2 is a rat monoclonal
IgG1 that was isolated from a human choriocarcinoma hybridoma that
specifically binds h1 integrin extracellular domain (22–24). Prior experiments using F(ab¶)2 fragments of enzyme-digested AIIB2 indicated that the
epitope-binding portion of the antibody was active and resulted in downmodulation of h1 integrin–mediated signaling (21, 25).
Apoptosis and proliferation assays in three-dimensional lrECM.
Proliferating cells from three-dimensional lrECM cultures were detected by
indirect immunofluorescence of Ki-67 nuclear antigen. Samples taken from
cultures were fixed onto glass slides using methanol/acetone and blocked in
10% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber.
Slides were then incubated in primary rabbit antibody against Ki-67, clone
MIB-1 (Novocastra Laboratories), for 1 h. After washing in PBS, FITCconjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (The Jackson Laboratory) was
applied for 1 h in a dark humidified chamber. Slides were then washed and
counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) before mounting
with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Apoptosis was
assayed by detecting terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) in samples taken from three-dimensional lrECM
cell culture using a commercially available kit (In Situ Cell Death Detection
Kit, Fluorescein; Roche). Samples from cultures were fixed onto glass slides
in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1%
sodium citrate. After washing, cells were incubated in TUNEL reaction
mixture at 37jC for 60 min and mounted.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. S-1 and T4-2 cells grown
on tissue culture plastic were harvested using 0.25% trypsin. After
resuspending cells in DMEM/F-12 medium containing trypsin inhibitor,
cells were spun down and washed in 5% fetal bovine serum and 0.1%
sodium azide in PBS on ice. Cells were incubated first in dilute primary
Annexin V antibody (Trevigen) for at 4jC for 30 to 60 min, then washed and
incubated with a fluorescein-conjugated IgG secondary antibody (1:100) for
30 to 60 min. After washing, the pellet was immediately suspended in 1%
paraformaldehyde. Cells were analyzed using a Beckman-Coulter EPICS XLMCL Analyzer. System II Data Acquisition and Display software, version 2.0,
was used for data analysis.
Colony-forming assays. T4-2 and S-1 cells were propagated on twodimensional culture as previously described (21). After reaching 50% to 70%
confluence, culture flasks were exposed to IR (Sham, 2, 4, or 8 Gy). Six hours
later, they were trypsinized and replated onto 35-mm per well dishes and
allowed to grow for 10 to 12 days. Dishes were treated with crystal violet
and colonies with >50 cells were counted. Six wells per condition were
plated for n = 3 experiments. Plating efficiencies and surviving fractions
were estimated based on binomial probability distribution.
Western immunoblot. To release cells from three-dimensional lrECM,
cultures were first treated with ice-cold PBS/EDTA [0.01 mol/L sodium
phosphate (pH 7.2) containing 138 mmol/L sodium chloride and 5 mmol/
L EDTA] and then lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer as
previously described (21). Protein was aliquoted onto reducing SDS gels in
equal amounts and separated using low voltage current. Protein bands
were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen), and blots
were blocked with 5% nonfat milk. Blots were probed with antibodies as
listed below, then washed, incubated with secondary antibody, and
exposed to X-ray film. Antibodies used included h1 integrin, clone 18
(Oncogene); FAK, clone 77 (BD Transduction Laboratories); phospho-FAK,
clone 14 (BD Transduction Laboratories); AKT, clone 7 (BD Transduction
Laboratories); phospho-AKT (Cell Signaling); phospho-h1 integrin (Biosource); TSC-2 clone c-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA);

phospho-Thr 1462-TSC-2 (Cell Signaling); h actin: clone AC-15 (Sigma);
secondary enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) anti-rabbit IgG/ECL, antimouse IgG (Amersham).
Tumor growth and toxicity assessment in vivo. Female BALB/c nu/
congenic mice were obtained from Simonsen Laboratories and kept in a
controlled animal barrier at five per cage with water and chow as needed.
After 1 week, animals were injected s.c. with 107 MCF-7 cells into the
posterior rear flank. Estradiol pellets were inserted s.c. above the tail for
animals bearing MCF-7 xenografts. AIIB2 antibody or nonspecific rat IgG
was injected into the i.p. cavity biweekly beginning on day 7 to 8 after cell
implantation, before or after IR exposure. Before irradiation, animals were
restricted in a Lucite container and the upper hemi-torso was shielded
using 1.0-cm-thick cerrobend. IR was delivered to the exposed tumor and
posterior hemi-torso using a 250 kVP source. Biweekly tumor dimensions
(width, height, and depth) were recorded. At the time of sacrifice, animals
were euthanized, and tumors were harvested and either immediately snap
frozen or fixed in formalin. Animals were monitored for toxicity by
measuring weight, assessing overall activity, and performing necropsy. All
experimental procedures were received before approval by the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory Animal Welfare and Safety Committee.
Detection and quantification of Ki67 and TUNEL on in vivo tumor
sections. We have developed methods to detect dual immunofluorescence
of Ki-67 and TUNEL (adapted from Schafer and colleagues; ref. 26) in
paraffin-embedded tissues that will allow simultaneous evaluation of the
patterns of proliferation and apoptosis in situ. Five-micrometer sections
from each tumor were baked in a 60jC oven for 30 min, dewaxed in xylene,
and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by heating slides in 10 mmol/L sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for
45 min at 95 to 97jC. After cooling for 30 min at room temperature,
sections were washed and then blocked in 10% goat serum/PBS for 1 h.
Primary antibody against Ki67 (vector) is diluted in 10% goat serum/PBS,
applied to the slide, and incubated overnight at 4jC. Slides were washed
and incubated with Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
(Molecular Probes) and diluted in 10% goat serum/PBS for 40 min at room
temperature. Slides are subsequently washed and labeled with DAPI.
Primary antibody was withheld from negative controls.
After verification of staining, coverslips were removed and sections were
washed thoroughly with PBS. All samples were permeabilized in freshly
prepared 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate in H2O for 10 min at room
temperature. Slides were then blocked for 1 h in 3% bovine serum albumin,
20% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and washed with PBS.
To detect apoptosis, we used In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein
(Roche). A TUNEL reaction mixture of label and enzyme solution was
incubated on each slide for 1 h in a dark, 37jC incubator. Negative controls
were incubated with label solution only. After washing in PBS, slides were
labeled again with DAPI, mounted with Vectashield. Lymph node tissue was
used as a positive control for both Ki67 and TUNEL staining.
After staining, fluorescent images were acquired on a Zeiss Axioplan 2
Imaging microscope and AxioCam camera. Five representative images will
be obtained for each tumor using a 40 oil objective and 10 eyepiece for a
total magnification of 400. All final images consist of a composite of three
different exposures: DAPI (nuclei), FITC (TUNEL), and Cy3 (Ki67).
MetaMorph software was used to quantify the number of positive versus
total nuclei present in each image composite. For each image, a DAPI
‘‘mask’’ was created by accounting for all the nuclei from the DAPI exposure
that fit within an established size-exclusion variable. Using the mask as a
template, cells with an overlapping signal in rhodamine for Ki67-positive
nuclei are classified as positive or negative according to a threshold for
signal intensity that is predetermined by eye. The advantages of this
automated counting system are increased accuracy and decreased observer
subjectivity. The potential limitation is that the signal intensity threshold is
set and those nuclei that have positive but dim staining was not included.
The error is systematic and still small compared with other biases
introduced with manual counting. To minimize this potential error, signal
intensities are set using negative and positive controls for batches of slides
stained at the same time using the same reagents. Thus, each batch is
processed independently. TUNEL-positive nuclei were manually verified to

account for the variation in morphology of apoptotic cells, including
chromosomal condensation, blebbing, and cell shrinkage.
Confocal microscopy. A Zeiss LSM 410 inverted laser scanning confocal
microscope equipped with an external argon/krypton laser was used to
acquire immunofluorescence images from thin sections of three-dimensional lrECM cultures and breast cancer xenografts. A Zeiss Fluor 40
(1.3 numerical aperture) objective was used, and images were captured at
the colony mid-section for three-dimensional lrECM cultures and breast
cancer xenografts. The relative immunofluorescence intensity of images was
standardized by comparing only slides that were processed simultaneously
under identical conditions.
Statistical analysis. For Ki-67 and TUNEL counts in three-dimensional
lrECM, each culture condition (e.g., each dose of AIIB2 or IgG and each
dose of IR in both sequences) was compared in pair-wise fashion and
m2 statistics were calculated for significant differences between groups.
A P value of <0.05 was considered to be an association that had a 95%
probability of not being due to chance alone.
We estimated the numbers of animals needed for each experiment based
on our prior experience with the MCF-7 xenograft models (19). The
coefficient of variation for tumor volume using MCF-7 xenograft tumors
is f0.4. Assuming equal sample sizes and a two-sample Student’s t test, we
estimated that eight mice per group were needed to have 80% power (with a
type 1 error of 5%) to detect a difference of 60% in mean volume between
groups. In our first experiment, we started with 14 animals per group with
planned animal sacrifice at different time points for biochemical analysis so
that at 4 wk, 8 animals per group would be remaining. Repeat verification
experiments were done with n = 8 animals per group (data not shown). For
tumor volume data, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used
for analysis at each time point. For each dose of AIIB2 or control IgG in vivo,
a two-sided pair-wise Student’s t test or m2 comparison was used to analyze
differences between TUNEL and Ki-67 expression. MINITAB (Minitab, Inc.)
statistical software was used for all calculations.

Results
B1 Integrin inhibition and IR are proapoptotic in malignant
breast cell colonies and nonmalignant cells in two-dimensional, but not in acini-like structures in three-dimensional,
lrECM. The original three-dimensional assay developed by
Petersen and Bissell laboratories (26) consisted of breast cells
suspended in a lrECM. Under these conditions, nonmalignant and
malignant cells can be rapidly and robustly distinguished from
each other (26). We modified this assay to use as a screen for novel
therapies and showed that it could be used as a surrogate to
discriminate between normal and malignant tissue response to h1
integrin inhibitory antibody in vivo (19).
In the present study, we used the modified three-dimensional
lrECM assay to compare apoptotic response of malignant colonies
and nonmalignant acini to IR with and without h1 integrin
inhibitory antibody. We treated the preformed S1 and T4-2
structures with 8 Gy IR or 0.08 mg/mL h1 integrin inhibitory
antibody (AIIB2) alone or in combination, where AIIB2 was added
to the culture medium for 24 hours and the medium was changed
before IR exposure. The T4-2 cultures exhibited significantly more
apoptosis compared with S-1 cultures (4.8% versus 0.75%, P < 0.05)
after a single dose of 8 Gy, and the response was enhanced with
the addition of AIIB2 (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In contrast, on
standard two-dimensional tissue culture plastic, fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis for TUNEL or Annexin V showed
that both nonmalignant S-1 and malignant T4-2 cells had similar
apoptotic responses to 8 Gy of IR (20% versus 14.2%, P > 0.05),
which were both enhanced with the addition of AIIB2 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Furthermore, cellular reproductive capacity
following IR exposure (0–8 Gy) assessed by colony forming assays

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (11). June 1, 2008

showed even more radiosensitivity in S1 compared with T4-2 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2).
B1 Integrin inhibition administered after IR optimally
enhances apoptosis associated with a down-regulation of Akt
activity in three-dimensional lrECM. IR has been shown to upregulate h1 integrin expression in lung cancer cells in twodimensional (nonmalignant cells were not tested in this study) and
breast cell lines in three-dimensional lrECM (3, 5). Because we
found previously that continuous AIIB2 treatment for 72 hours
compared with 24-hour exposure was more effective in killing
cancer cells, with little or no effect on S-1 colonies (19), we added
AIIB2 to the medium each time the medium was changed until
cultures were harvested (Fig. 1A). This protocol significantly
increased apoptosis in T4-2 breast cancer cells in three-dimensional lrECM post-IR (>80% increase, P < 0.05; Fig. 1C) without
significantly affecting S-1 nonmalignant acini (Fig. 1B).
Using two-dimensional cultures of small-cell lung cancer and
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines (did not include normal
controls), others have shown that h1 integrin mediates resistance
to apoptosis after cytotoxic insults, an effect mediated by a number
of mechanisms, including up-regulation of Akt signaling (10, 13).
Akt is a serine-threonine kinase that acts immediately downstream
of PI3K as a mediator of cell survival post-IR (27–29). Akt activity
was up-regulated following IR in T4-2 breast cancer cells in threedimensional lrECM measured by the increase in phosphorylation of
serine 473 on Akt (p-S473 Akt) using Western blots. Up-regulation
post-IR (2-fold post 8 Gy IR) was dose dependent (Fig. 1E),
indicating that IR induced an increase in Akt activity that could
potentially be targeted by h1 integrin inhibitory antibodies. To
address this possibility further, we assayed three-dimensional
lrECM cultures for levels of p-S473 Akt after exposure either to IR
and control IgG antibodies or a combination of IR and AIIB2 with
the latter applied both before and after IR. We found that downregulation of Akt activity occurred when AIIB2 was administered
post-IR (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, Akt activity after 6 hours of AIIB2
treatment alone did not decline once the cancer cells had already
formed colonies (Fig. 1C).
To determine whether these findings were generalizable to other
breast cancer cell lines, we used MCF-7 cells, a widely used model
for breast cancer. In addition to determining the optimal sequence
of therapy, we treated three-dimensional lrECM cultures with AIIB2
both before and after exposure to IR (Fig. 2A). Compared with
colonies that were treated with IR and a nonspecific antibody
control, colonies treated with combined IR and AIIB2 in either
sequence showed an appreciable decrease in total cell numbers
(data not shown) and a significant (>70% increase, P < 0.05) in
apoptosis (assayed by TUNEL) compared with IR alone (Fig. 2B).
The observed differences with untreated control were larger when
IR was given before AIIB2; however, the data did not reach
statistical significance to a level of 95% certainty in two of four
experiments. We further verified the down-regulation in Akt
activity associated with h1 integrin inhibition post-IR (Fig. 2C).
IR-induced Akt effects could be overcome by application of
B1 integrin inhibitory antibody. To evaluate whether apoptosis
induced by h1 integrin inhibition or IR operated directly through
Akt signaling, we used T4-2 cells transfected with a constitutively
activated, myristoylated form of Akt (myr-Akt; refs. 30, 31; the
construct was a kind gift of R. Roth; ref. 32) Fig. 3A. We measured
apoptosis using TUNEL in T4-2 myr-Akt colonies after either IR
alone or in combination with 0.08 mg/mL AIIB2—the dose used
previously to induce apoptosis in several breast cancer cell lines in

three-dimensional lrECM (19). In contrast to T4-2 vector controls,
which showed increased apoptosis after IR plus 0.08 mg/mL AIIB2,
T4-2 myr-Akt colonies were refractory to this treatment (Fig. 3B).
We reasoned that if Akt activity was responsive to h1 integrin
signaling, then increasing h1 integrin inhibition could abrogate
Akt signaling even in myr-Akt cells. A 3-fold increase in AIIB2
(0.24 mg/mL) elicited a 2-fold increase in apoptosis in T4-2 myrAkt cells in an IR dose-dependent manner in three-dimensional
lrECM (Fig. 3C). To determine if this apoptotic response correlated
with down-regulation of Akt signaling, we measured p-S473 Akt
and phosphorylated threonine 1462 TSC-2 (p-Thr1462 TSC-2), a
downstream target of Akt activity (32). Concordant with the results
observed in MCF-7 cells, Akt was up-regulated 6 hours after IR
alone in T4 myr-Akt (Fig. 3D). Moreover, treatment with these
higher doses of AIIB2 corresponded to down-regulation in p-S473
Akt and p-Thr1462 TSC-2. Taken together, these data strongly
suggest that IR resistance is in part mediated by activation of h1
integrin and a subsequent increase in Akt signaling both of which
could be abrogated by h1 integrin inhibition.
Combining B1 integrin inhibition with IR treatment in vivo
allows reduction of the effective dose of IR. Given the promising
results in three-dimensional lrECM, we asked whether these data
could be validated in vivo. Following implantation of MCF-7 cells
into the rear flank of female athymic nu/ mice (n = 14 per
group), animals were subsequently randomized to receive either
IR and control IgG, IR followed by AIIB2 or AIIB2 followed by IR,
as described in Materials and Methods (Fig. 4A). Overall, the
addition of AIIB2 to IR-enhanced tumor growth inhibition
compared with either treatment alone (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Remarkably, we found that animals that received 2 Gy followed by
AIIB2 had similar tumor growth inhibition to those that received
8 Gy with control antibody (P < 0.014; Fig. 4B). We measured
apoptosis at 24 hours after the final treatment in each group and
found that tumors treated with 2 Gy plus AIIB2 also had a higher
rate of apoptosis compared with other groups (data not shown).
To verify whether Akt activity was down-regulated by combined
treatment as we had observed in three-dimensional lrECM, we
assayed whole tumor cell lysates for evidence of Akt activity by
probing for phosphorylation of S473 Akt. Again, the in vivo results
replicated the findings in three-dimensional culture: We observed
an increase in AKT activity associated with IR dose, which was
down-modulated by the addition of AIIB2 after IR (Fig. 4C).

Discussion
Here, we report promising results combining h1 integrin
inhibitory antibody with IR to decrease the total effective radiation
dose and to maximize the efficacy of treatment by sensitizing the
tumor, but not normal organs, to IR. Our increasing awareness of
the global effects of IR on tissues, and the role of the
microenvironment on modifying cellular response to IR (2, 33),
are pointing to the necessity of reducing IR effective doses if at all
possible by advancing our knowledge and providing novel
therapeutic targets. h1 Integrin plays a multifaceted role in cancer
progression and resistance to cytotoxic treatment including IR.
We have shown previously that the h1 integrin inhibitory antibody,
AIIB2, can revert the malignant phenotype of cells in threedimensional lrECM (21) and enhance breast cancer cell death in

xenografts while sparing nonmalignant acini in culture and normal
organs in vivo (19). Here, we show that AIIB2 post-IR selectively
enhances apoptosis in breast cancer cells but not nonmalignant
acini in three-dimensional lrECM organotypic cultures, and that
antibody combined with low doses of IR can achieve similar
inhibition in tumor growth to single, but much larger doses of IR
in vivo. In addition, we find that enhanced apoptosis after
combined treatment is associated with down-modulation in Akt
signaling, again both in three-dimensional cultures and in vivo.
Importantly, when we assayed for apoptosis and reproductive
death in standard two-dimensional tissue culture, we were unable
to discriminate between malignant and nonmalignant cells. These
data corroborate our previously published data on treatment with
single chemical agents (19, 34) and indicate that the intrinsic
radiosensitivity of both normal and cancer cells are modified also
in the context of the three-dimensional structures. Importantly, we
verify here that the three-dimensional lrECM assay is a useful and
faithful surrogate for predicting differences in normal and
malignant tissue response in vivo.
We had shown previously that IR induces heritable and global
changes in cell-ECM interactions, and specifically in h1 integrin
expression, in human mammary epithelial cells cultured in three-

dimensional lrECM. We also have observed activation of h1
integrins in breast cancer cells post-IR,4 corroborating reports by
others of integrin activation in irradiated tumors (4, 5, 35). We
reasoned that if h1 integrin was up-regulated by IR, then AIIB2
would be more effective post-IR than pre-IR because of increased
epitope accessibility to antibody binding. To test whether there was
an optimal sequencing of treatment, we used the three-dimensional lrECM assay where cancer cells were cultured to form
tumor-like colonies and then treated with either AIIB2, 24 hours
before IR or 24 hours post-IR. Both sequences resulted in
significantly greater cell death (P < 0.05) compared with IR alone
without significant toxicity to nonmalignant cells. Although there
was a trend that favored sequencing IR followed by AIIB2, this did
not achieve a statistical significance between the two treatment
regimens over multiple repeated experiments. One of the likely
reasons for this finding is that the magnitude of effect of AIIB2
alone was greater than a measurable difference attributed solely
to the sequence of treatment. Importantly, AIIB2 was maintained
continuously in the three-dimensional lrECM cultures as it would

be also in vivo. Studies that examined the effect of sequencing PI3K
inhibitor, LY294002, in breast cancer cells in two-dimensional
culture (36) reported an optimal increase in apoptosis after
combined IR and LY when LY was given both pre- and post-IR.
However, the effects of the inhibitor and IR in nonmalignant cells
were not reported. Another group (37) showed that LY294002 given
pre-IR in HeLa cells was significantly better than post-IR. These
results are not directly comparable with ours because the culture
models and mechanism of action of Akt pathway inhibition are
different in two-dimensional and three-dimensional models;
however, they indicate that sequencing may play an important
role in optimally delivering combined treatments based on the
mechanisms of interaction of the inhibitor and IR and the context
in which IR and the drug are delivered.
PI3K inhibitors have long been known to sensitize to, or work in
combination with, IR to enhance apoptosis in several cancer cell

types in cultured cell lines. Akt is emerging as a central mediator of
resistance both from studies showing the radiosensitizing effect of
PI3K inhibition (5, 38) and as a major effector of PI3K, the activity
of which is modified by multiple cell surface receptors, including
growth factors and integrins. In our three-dimensional lrECM
model, AIIB2 post-IR resulted in down-regulation of Akt signaling,
which was associated with enhanced apoptosis.
Our data complement those of others who showed that survival
of bladder cancer cells harboring a mutation in ras was significantly
decreased after combined treatment with LY294002 and IR,
although these investigators reported no significant benefit of LY
alone either in two-dimensional cultures or in vivo (16, 39). Others
also have reported a synergistic effect of LY294002 and IR for
glioblastoma multiforme xenografts (27). Although dose-limiting
toxicity and pharmacokinetics limit LY294002 as a viable drug in
humans, these studies highlight the importance of targeting Akt in

Figure 4. IR (2 Gy) followed by AIIB2 is more effective than AIIB2 or 2 Gy alone.
A, experimental schema: MCF-7 xenograft-bearing mice (n = 14) were
randomized to receive either IR plus control antibody, IR plus AIIB2, or AIIB2 plus
IR. B, comparison of tumor growth curves shows that 2 Gy IR!AIIB2 resulted
in greater time to tumor progression (400 mm3) than 2 Gy alone (*, log-rank
P < 0.014) and was similar in efficacy to 8 Gy alone. C, Western blot shows that IR

conjunction with IR. In addition, Akt has been shown to be a
promising target in cancer cells downstream of integrins and
growth factor pathways post-IR (17). Thus, multiple pathways at the
cell surface converge at Akt via PI3K, a central mediator of cancer
cell survival, which may be targeted simultaneously to enhance
therapeutic efficacy. Our data point to the existence of an IRdependent survival pathway mediated by Akt that is downmodulated with h1 integrin inhibition. It is quite possible that IR
affects polarity pathways involving Rac 1 (32), which was shown also
to affect radiation-induced apoptosis (40, 41).
Of note, h1 integrin is ubiquitously expressed, and, thus, there
are many potential targets for AIIB2 in vivo, in both malignant and
normal tissue (42). We previously showed that AIIB2 was not toxic
in vivo at doses up to 20 mg/mL/kg. Thus, although the antibody
may recognize nontumor targets, our data indicated that the

context of h1 integrin expression, for example, within an organized
structure, determined the apoptotic response to the antibody, as
we showed in three-dimensional lrECM (19). In our present studies,
we focused on whether the combination of IR and AIIB2 produced
an antitumor growth effect and whether this therapy was toxic to
animals. Further studies are warranted to explore other potential
therapeutic targets for AIIB2 in malignant tissue, including
neoangiogenic vasculature (42).
We found that the addition of AIIB2 treatment to IR in vivo
resulted in significant improvement in inhibition of tumor growth
by allowing a much smaller dose of IR (2 Gy) but reaching the same
end point of higher doses of IR alone (8 Gy). To our knowledge, this
is the first report of a h1 integrin inhibitor used in conjunction with
IR in a therapeutic context in vivo. There was a modest
improvement in tumor growth inhibition associated with the
addition of AIIB2 to 8 Gy compared with 8 Gy alone. However,
improvement on 2 Gy of radiation was considerable. These data
suggest that there may be an IR dose threshold above which the
addition of AIIB2 has decreasing value in enhancing tumor cell
death. We acknowledge that the doses and single fractions used in
these experiments may not be the optimal dosing and sequencing
in humans and that these data do not establish a synergistic
relationship between h1 integrin inhibition and IR; however, these
data provide proof of principle that the combination of h1 integrin
inhibition and IR are a promising novel strategy for breast cancer
radiotherapy.
Several questions remain unanswered and are currently
undergoing active investigation by others and us. Clinically,
fractionated IR is used to minimize normal tissue damage. It is
unclear how h1 integrin inhibitory agents may be optimized with
fractionated therapy, and to what degree the total necessary IR
dose may be modified to achieve maximal tumor control. A role for
h1 integrin– and Akt-mediated resistance post-IR is an active area
of investigation. Our data indicate that there are alternate
pathways that act in the presence of IR that could promote
survival via Akt. Together, our findings show great promise for the
combination of h1 integrin inhibitory agents and IR and provide a
rationale for combining multiple agents that target the Akt/PI3K
pathway post-IR.
