Abstract
Many tumors are believed to be maintained by a small number of cancer stem–like cells, where cure is thought
to require eradication of this cell population. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of acute promyelocytic
leukemia (APL) before and during therapy with regard to disease initiation, progression, and therapeutic
response. This investigation used a mathematical model of hematopoiesis and a dataset derived from the North
American Intergroup Study INT0129. The known phenotypic constraints of APL could be explained by a
combination of differentiation blockade of PML–RARa–positive cells and suppression of normal hematopoiesis.
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) neutralizes the differentiation block and decreases the proliferation rate of
leukemic stem cells in vivo. Prolonged ATRA treatment after chemotherapy can cure patients with APL by
eliminating the stem-like cell population over the course of approximately one year. To our knowledge, this study
offers the ﬁrst estimate of the average duration of therapy that is required to eliminate stem-like cancer cells from
a human tumor, with the potential for the reﬁnement of treatment strategies to better manage human
malignancy. Cancer Res; 74(19); 5386–96. 2014 AACR.

Major Finding
By combining a mathematical model of hematopoiesis
with data from a large randomized trial of acute promyelocytic leukemia, this study offers the ﬁrst determination of
the average duration of therapy required to eliminate all
stem-like cells in a human tumor.

Introduction
The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis states that at the root
of most (perhaps all) tumors, there is a population of cancer
stem cells that is not only able to renew itself but also gives rise

to the bulk of the tumor cell population (26–29). These CSCs
are essential for the origin and the continued growth and
maintenance of the tumor. As a consequence, these cells are an
important target of therapy, as it is thought that eradication of
such cells is necessary for a potential cure of the tumor. Various
models have been developed that address this hypothesis from
a theoretical perspective and there is increasing evidence for its
support from animal models of cancer. Although CSCs were
initially isolated from patients with acute leukemia (26–29),
they have now been identiﬁed in virtually all types of tumors. It
is therefore important to understand the dynamics of these
cells under therapy and whether they can be eradicated,
leading to cure of the disease and long-term survival of
patients. Here, we utilize data from a clinical trial of therapy
for APL to understand the dynamics of leukemic stem cells
under therapy. We use a mathematical/computational model
of hematopoiesis together with quantitative data from the
North American Intergroup Study INT0129 (30, 31) to determine the probability that the leukemic stem cells are eradicated at a certain time under this treatment regimen. APL was
chosen for a number of reasons: (i) the disease is well deﬁned
with most patients having the translocation t(15q22;17q12),
leading to PML–RARa oncogene activation (14–16), (ii) the
tumor burden can be quantitated using quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR; refs. 31, 32), (iii) targeted therapy in the form of
all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is available and highly effective
(33, 34), (iv) the availability of serial quantitative data on
disease burden from a large randomized clinical trial that
allows us to investigate the effects of ATRA treatment and
chemotherapy separately (31, 32, 35), and (v) the availability of
a mathematical/computational model of hematopoiesis that
has already been utilized to understand the dynamics of

Dynamics of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia

Quick Guide to Equations and Assumptions
Our multicompartment model of hematopoiesis has been described elsewhere, but here we describe it brieﬂy for clarity
(Fig. 1; refs. 1–6). Cells in a given compartment i with probability ei differentiate and produce two cells that migrate to the next
downstream compartment ði þ 1Þ or self-renew and increase compartment i by one cell with probability 1  "i . Here,
"compartments" are not understood as physical spaces but as an accounting tool to keep track of the replication and differentiation
of each cell. Proliferation rates ri are intrinsic for each compartment and with ri < riþ1 . Parameters describing cells in non–stem cell
compartments i > 0 are ﬁxed, by allometric scaling arguments (1) and data from human hematopoiesis and are given by "hi ¼ 0:85,
rhi ¼ ðg h Þi rh0 with g h ¼ 1:26. Thus, the rate of proliferation increases exponentially with the compartment [subscripts refer to the
compartment, whereas superscripts refer to healthy (h) or cancerous (c) cells]. In the stem cell compartment i ¼ 0,
N0 ¼ 400; "h0 ¼ 0:5, and rh0 ¼ 1=365 days (7–10). Undisturbed, the above system reaches a steady state, where cell numbers
ﬂuctuate around an average cell count. In the absence of disease, the steady state for each compartment is given by
Nih ¼

N0h ð2"Þi1
:
g i ð2"  1Þi

Under this parameter setting, we need 32 compartments to represent hematopoiesis with a daily output of approximately
3:5  1011 cells (1–6). This can be viewed as an almost continuous differentiation process of cells (Fig. 1).
Because of the high cell turnover rates, the dynamics of normal cells in such hierarchies can be captured by a linear system of
differential equations (5, 6). An arbitrary number of mutations can be described analytically by similar equations if mutated cells
proliferate independently (5, 6). We model the dynamics of normal and leukemic cell lineages by such systems of differential
equations. The equations for normal cells follow from the inﬂux and output of healthy cells in each compartment and are derived as

cells into compartment i þ 1 at rate "hi rhi Nih , leading to a change in number arising from processes within the compartment of

Here, l denotes the compartment where the cancer-driving mutation occurs, i.e., the leukemic stem–like cells. Compartments
upstream of l are not affected by this mutation and proliferate independently (Fig. 1). However, the proliferation of healthy cells,
Nih , in and downstream of compartment l is potentially inhibited by the leukemic cells, Nic . This interference is modeled by Hill
functions (11). In the absence of malignant cells, homeostasis is normal, but proliferation of healthy cells is suppressed with
increasing numbers of leukemic cells (12).
The dynamics of leukemic cells can be described by the following set of equations

In the absence of therapy, the number of leukemic cells in the compartment of origin grows exponentially for eic < 0.5, leading
to an even faster growth in downstream compartments. Leukemic cells proliferate independently of healthy cells as evidenced
by observations in animal models of disease (13). The leukemia-driving cells occupy compartment l (Fig. 1, bottom). Thus,
leukemic cells can only be found in and downstream of compartment l. In addition, the leukemic cell proliferation properties differ
signiﬁcantly from those of healthy cells.

Model Constraints
1. Phenotype: Because PML–RARa expression reduces differentiation and enhances self-renewal of cells (13–17), we supposed
that "c < "h ¼ 0:85. Generally, APL is associated with pancytopenia due to a reduction in bone marrow output. Therefore, we
adjusted our parameters to reduce the cells in compartment 31 to 10% to 20% of normal while ensuring that the

intramedullary compartments were hypercellular. ATRA reverses the differentiation block and, therefore, "c ! 0:85. In vitro,
ATRA slows down the rate of replication of leukemic cells by at least a factor of 0.61 (18). While chemotherapy kills the
majority of cancer cells, the proliferation properties of surviving cancer cells remain unchanged.
2. Time to diagnosis and origin of the disease: The disease must start from a single leukemic stem cell in keeping with the clonal
origin of cancer. Using data from Guibal and colleagues (13), we inferred that the minimum time for diagnosis in mice is
approximately 120 days. Using our previously described allometric scaling relationship (19, 20) comparing timescales

respectively, we could determine that the minimum time from the appearance of the ﬁrst leukemic stem cell in humans to
diagnosis is more than 872 days. An animal model of APL suggests that the disease may originate in a colony-forming unit,
granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM cell; ref. 13), which in our model would reside in compartments 13 to 15. A limited study
of three patients also suggests that CD34þCD38 cells do not have the t(15q22;17q12), typical of the disease (21).
Clonal burden in bone marrow: The average tumor burden of leukemic stem cells at the time of diagnosis is approximately
1% of the tumor population present in the bone marrow (22), and the leukemic cells represent 65% to 98% of the marrow
cellularity (23).
The average time for the bone marrow to appear normal after therapy with ATRA is 38 days (range, 25–90 days; ref. 23).
Patients treated with ATRA alone for induction often have an increase in their leukocyte count that peaks between 12 and
14 days after initiation of therapy (23).
Time to relapse: If patients are treated with ATRA alone until they have a morphologic remission, they relapse on average
after approximately 110 days (45–300; ref. 24, 25).
ATRA does not alter the dynamic properties of normal hematopoietic cells.

mutations in other hematologic disorders (1–6). In the following, we provide a brief summary of the clinical trial, a description of the mathematical model together with the justiﬁcation
of the constraints used to determine the model parameters,
followed by a description of the data ﬁtting and presentation of
results. Details of the mathematical model as well as the
clinical trial are provided in Materials and Methods. In summary, our mathematical model contains a ﬁxed number of
compartments that represent different stages of cell differentiation. At each stage, cells proliferate with a ﬁxed rate ri and
differentiate into the next downstream compartment with
probability "i . This general framework allows us to describe
normal hematopoiesis as well as the initiation and progression
of different types of leukemia, deﬁned by changes in proliferation and differentiation parameters of malignant cells. As a
result, we provide an estimate of the timescale with which a
leukemic stem cell population is eliminated in humans.

Patients and Methods
Clinical trial INT0129
The North American Intergroup trial of ATRA in APL was
initially reported in 1997 with subsequent updates
(30, 36, 37). Patients were recruited from centers afﬁliated
with the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, the Southwest
Oncology Group, and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group. Brieﬂy, patients with newly diagnosed APL were
randomly assigned to induction therapy either with combination chemotherapy: daunorubicin (45 mg/m2 daily on
days 1–3) and cytosine arabinoside (100 mg/m2 by continuous infusion for 7 days; N ¼ 191) or ATRA alone (45 mg/m2
orally in two divided doses daily) that could be given for up
to 90 days (N ¼ 188). Pediatric patients less than 3 years of

5388

Cancer Res; 74(19) October 1, 2014

age were treated with the same protocol, but with appropriate
dose modiﬁcations. Subsequently, patients who achieved a
complete remission with induction therapy received two cycles
of consolidation: the ﬁrst cycle was identical to the initial
induction chemotherapy regimen while the second cycle consisted of high dose cytosine arabinoside (2 g/m2 every 12 hours
for 4 days) with daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 daily on days 1 and 2.
The patients were subsequently randomized to observation or
maintenance therapy with ATRA (45 mg/m2 orally in two
divided doses daily) for up to 1 year. Fifty-four patients who
received induction with ATRA were randomized to maintenance with ATRA, whereas 56 patients initially treated with
chemotherapy went on ATRA maintenance after the second
randomization. Patients had serial measurement of the PML–
RARa oncogene as previously described (31, 32, 35). Our
mathematical/computational model was ﬁtted to this serial
data, after normalization of PML–RARa to GAPDH with the
pretreatment copy number value of PML–RARa/GAPDH normalized to 1. Serial collection of blood samples for qRT-PCR
quantiﬁcation was not mandatory for the trial and as a result
the data set is incomplete in this respect.
Parameter estimation
We use the initial condition of 1 leukemic stem cell in
compartment l with the described constraints to numerically
solve the deterministic equations from above for each compartment using standard numerical procedures implemented
in Mathematica. Throughout this process, we assume that the
effect of ATRA on leukemic cells is constant. Each numerical
solution gives the disease scenario arising from a given set of
model parameters. In our case, we had to determine four key
parameters: (i) the proliferation rate and (ii) differentiation
probability in the compartment of the cancer-initiating cell

(rc15 and "c15 ) and (iii) the proliferation rate and (iv) differentiation probability of cancer cells in the bone marrow (rc1625
and "c1625 ). We then performed an extensive parameter search,
varying these four parameters within a wide range compatible
with the phenotypic constrains of the disease (i.e., rc15 > rh15 and
"c15 < "h15 as well as rc1625 < rh1625 and "c1625 < "h1625 ). We
compared the properties of the modeled disease scenario to
the restrictive phenotypic constrains of the disease (points i–
vii) described above. If the model prediction deviated in a
single point from the phenotypic constraints, the parameter
set was discarded. This resulted in a restricted set of parameters for the disease in the absence of therapy.
We assumed that therapy with either ATRA or chemotherapy was started as soon as a diagnosis was made. The proliferation and differentiation parameters of the leukemic cells
were altered to ﬁt the available response data in case of ATRA
therapy. Chemotherapy was implemented as a single catastrophic event, in which the majority of cancer and healthy
cells are killed, but the proliferation properties of the surviving
cancer cells remain unchanged. Healthy cells are not affected
by ATRA therapy and thus their dynamic properties are only
indirectly altered by the response of the leukemic cells to
therapy.

Stochastic simulations
We inferred the distribution of extinction times of leukemic
stem–like cells by performing stochastic simulations implemented by a Gillespie algorithm (38), based on an agent-based
representation of our hierarchical organization (5). We used
parameter estimations from our deterministic ﬁtting procedure, and therefore parameters were ﬁxed during all stochastic
simulations. We performed in total 104 independent stochastic
simulations and recorded the time until all cancer stem–like
cells went extinct, leading to a distribution of cancer stem–like
extinction times.

Results
Dynamics of untreated APL
Initially, we had to determine the time course and dynamic
properties of the leukemic stem and progenitor cells taking into
account the constraints that we identiﬁed from the literature,
in particular the known biology of the disease (Fig. 1; refs. 13–
17, 21, 23). Given that PML–RARa expression leads to a block in
differentiation, we had to impose a lower probability for the
differentiation of leukemic cells compared with healthy cells
"cl < "h ¼ 0:85 in our model. The leukemic stem cell in APL may

arise in a CFU-GM cell (13, 21), and therefore l ¼ 15 was chosen
as the founding compartment of APL in our hierarchical
model, based on our prior results (1, 39). We estimated that
the minimum time between the onset of the ﬁrst leukemic
stem cell and disease was 872 days (13, 19, 20), where disease
was deﬁned as a reduction in bone marrow output to
approximately 20% of normal, leading to cytopenias that
are typical for this leukemia. At the same time, the bone
marrow compartments will be expanded and the marrow
appears hypercellular. The parameter estimates that led to
the best ﬁt to the data are presented in Table 1.
Our ﬁts suggest that the leukemic stem cells replicate faster
and self-renew with a higher probability than normal CFU-GM
cells in the same compartment. Even based on their higher selfrenewal capacity alone, they have a considerable ﬁtness advantage compared with the normal progenitor cells. If we count
the number of offspring cells produced by a mutant cell in a
given compartment and compare it with the number of
offspring of a normal cell, we obtain for relative ﬁtness in our
mathematical model (fj; ref. 40),
fj ¼

1  "hj "cj

:

This translates into a relative ﬁtness advantage of 6.9
compared with normal CFU-GM (17). Moreover, our ﬁtting
suggests that the leukemic progenitor cells (downstream of
the leukemic stem cells) have an extremely high ﬁtness
advantage (based on the virtual absence of normal cells in
the circulation), estimated at 75 compared with their normal
counterparts (normalized to 1) due to the block in differentiation (and enhanced self-renewal). These estimates provide a vivid explanation of the rapid disease progression and
early high lethality associated with this disease before the
advent of ATRA therapy.
Dynamics of disease under chemotherapy treatment
We implement chemotherapy treatment as a single catastrophic event, in which the majority of both leukemic and
healthy cells are killed instantly. The proliferation parameters

5390

Cancer Res; 74(19) October 1, 2014

of surviving cells remain unchanged after chemotherapy treatment. Therefore, we only need to infer a single parameter (the
fraction of killed cells under chemotherapy) to determine the
dynamics of patients with APL under chemotherapy from our
mathematical model. We vary the fraction of killed cells and ﬁt
the resulting dynamics to the serial qRT-PCR data of the
fraction of patients treated with chemotherapy in the INT0129
trial. Our best parameter estimates (see Figs. 2 and 3) suggest
that only 0.3% of all cancer cells survived, compatible with
more than 2 log kill of leukemic cells. However, this also implies
that approximately 105 leukemic stem cells survive and relapse
is to be expected. This prediction is conﬁrmed by observations
from the follow up of the INT0129 trial were the risk of relapse
of chemotherapy-treated patients (without ATRA maintenance) was high. Note, that the characteristic peak of bone
marrow output, 10 to 12 days after ATRA treatment, does not
occur with chemotherapy (Fig. 2A vs. C).
Dynamics of disease under therapy with ATRA
ATRA alters the behavior of leukemic cells by (i) inducing
differentiation and (ii) slows down the rate of replication of
leukemic stem cells. Fitting of our model to serial RT-PCR data
from the INT0129 trial (Figs. 2 and 3A) provides an estimate for
the leukemic cell parameters under therapy as reported
in Table 2. We consider that therapy starts immediately after
diagnosis or 870 days from the appearance of the ﬁrst leukemic
stem cell. We assume that the differentiation probabilities
return to normal under ATRA therapy. The proliferation rates
within the bone marrow, g ATRA
1625 , are ﬁxed by the time until the
bone marrow output peaks. The proliferation rate of cancer

due to the exponential growth characteristics of hematopoiesis, and is thus difﬁcult to estimate from the data. However, it
is a crucial parameter to assess the probability of relapse. For

such a slowdown effect. Our proliferation rates in compartment i scale via ri ¼ ðg Þi r0: .

Extinction time of leukemic stem cells
Our model is in line with in vivo mouse experiments (13) that
before the initiation of therapy, the leukemic stem cell population ði ¼ 15Þ, increases exponentially (Fig. 3B). Thus, at the

On average the time for clonal extinction under ATRA
treatment is approximately 312 days (0.36  870 days).
However, this time increases exponentially with the number
of cells at diagnosis, and, therefore, continued therapy with
ATRA is a prerequisite to cure this disease. These results are
compatible with clinical observations and justify the need
for maintenance therapy for approximately 1 year that
seems to lead to a cure in many patients as treated in the
INT0129 trial (Fig. 3D).

For our parameters, we obtain 4  107 leukemic stem cells

Figure 3. A, response of APL cells to ATRA treatment inferred from the North American Intergroup trial (dots) and our model predictions (line, R ¼ 0.54, model
parameter as in Tables 1 and 2). A peak in tumor burden (here after 7–10 days) of ATRA treatment is typical of APL and is caused by the rapid differentiation of
APL progenitor cells. B, dependence of the height of the bone marrow peak on the time of disease diagnosis. Later diagnosis results in a higher bone

50 days after treatment initiation and declines to normal levels afterwards. D, estimated probability of patients being cured (gray line) under continuous ATRA
treatment inferred from stochastic individual-based computer simulations (see Materials and Methods for details; parameters as in A). The black dot
corresponds to the deterministic extinction time (here after 312 days) of the leukemic cancer stem–like cells given by equation (3). Because of the inherent
stochastic nature of the proliferation properties of the cancer stem–like cells, only 42% of patients are cured after 312 days of ATRA treatment and we
expect 58% of the patients with remaining APL stem–like cells in the bone marrow. After one year of ATRA treatment (gray dot), approximately 92% of patients
had no remaining cancer stem–like cells left.

is caused by the remaining cancer stem and progenitor cells
after therapy as well as the selection of mutant cells resistant to
therapy through a variety of mechanisms, including mutations
in the LBD domain of RARa, increased ATRA catabolism,
abnormal trafﬁcking of ATRA to the nucleus, the presence of
cytoplasmic retinoic acid binding protein, and overexpression
of BP1 (42, 43). Thus, the question of whether and when
treatment eradicates all cancer stem cells is critical. As intrinsic cell properties, such as the exact time of cell proliferation or
differentiation, are stochastic, one naturally expects the actual
extinction time of the leukemic stem cell pool to differ in
patients (44, 45). To obtain the distribution of these extinction
times under ATRA treatment, we implemented a computational representation of the mathematical model (see Materials and Methods) by utilizing standard Gillespie algorithms
(38) and ran exact individual-based stochastic simulations on
this model. We assumed that the initial decline from approximately 4  107 to 105 leukemic stem cells under ATRA
treatment follows the deterministic equations. We performed

5392

Cancer Res; 74(19) October 1, 2014

104 independent realizations of the stochastic simulations
initialized with 105 leukemic stem cells under ATRA treatment
that use the parameter estimations from Tables 1 and 2 and
recorded the extinction times of the leukemic stem cell pool.
The probability of leukemic stem cell eradication under ATRA
therapy that lasted less than 200 days is negligible (Fig. 3D
and Fig. 5). Only 42% of patients would be expected to be cured
after 312 days (deterministic extinction time), imposing a high
risk of relapse for over half of the patients. However, after one
year of ATRA treatment up to 92% of patients are free of
leukemic stem cells according to this model and therefore
"cured" of their disease.

Discussion
If we hope to better treat cancer, with emerging therapeutic
approaches, a detailed understanding of cancer initiation,
cancer progression, and response to treatment is essential.
Here, we combine a mathematical/computational approach

Figure 4. A, disease dynamics for a single patient treated with ATRA (R ¼ 0.95). B, disease dynamics of a single patient treated with chemotherapy (R ¼ 0.61).
The initial response to ATRA treatment is well described by our model prediction (blue line). However, this patient did not receive maintenance therapy
and ﬁnally relapsed 861 days after the initial treatment. In contrast, the patient treated with chemotherapy had an initial response to therapy, but progressed in
between cycles of chemotherapy. This variation could be caused by stochastic effects of cell proliferation together with a varying number of surviving
cancer stem–like cells per treatment.

with clinical trial data of treatment response of patients with
APL to ATRA therapy and/or chemotherapy. This approach
allows us to model leukemia progression from the occurrence
of the ﬁrst leukemic stem cell until the potential elimination of
the last cancer stem cell under treatment and thus provides
a detailed understanding of all phases of APL under two
different treatment regimes. At least one murine model of
APL suggests that the disease originates in a CFU-GM cell
(13, 22) and thus within the lower half (here compartment
15) of our hierarchical model. We acknowledge that there is
still some disagreement on the true origin of the leukemic
stem cell in APL (21, 46, 47), partly based on the animal
model used (46, 48) and it is likely that other mutations in
addition to the t(15q22;17q12) are required for APL to
develop (49). Although the cancer stem cell hypothesis is

increasingly accepted, and cancer-initiating (stem) cells
have been isolated from many tumors, the ﬁeld is still
somewhat controversial (27–29). Several possible explanations exist for the divergent results observed vis-a-vis the
presence, frequency, surface marker expression, and functional properties of these putative cells, including (i) the
animal model used for engraftment that provides the
complex microenvironment for cells to survive and grow,
(ii) genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity between tumors, (iii)
stage of the tumor, and others (47–49). However, the
presence of cellular hierarchies within acute leukemia is
less controversial and a critical component of our modeling
approach.
We ﬁnd that an interaction of leukemic and healthy cells is
sufﬁcient to explain the known phenotypic constrains of APL.
The bone marrow in APL usually appears hypercellular at
diagnosis, but a fraction of patients may have a hypocellular
bone marrow at diagnosis. This can be explained by the
suppression of healthy cells combined with a differentiation
block of APL cells in the bone marrow.
Our model of acute promyelocytic leukemia also reveals that
bone marrow failure syndromes are not necessarily due to
failures of the normal hematopoietic stem cell pool. They can
also occur by suppression of the proliferation of normal cells by
leukemic cells, for example, due to competition for cytokines.
This also implies that hematopoiesis returns to normal after
the eradication of the malignant cells as is typical for many
acute leukemias and is in line with our model as well as recent
observations in vivo (12).
Our model suggests that, in addition to the block of differentiation, APL stem–like cells have an increased proliferation
rate, and thus they have a signiﬁcant ﬁtness advantage (6.9 to
normal CFU-GM cells with 1.0) compared with normal cells.
Despite this ﬁtness advantage, the disease progresses slowly

Figure 5. The insets show the distribution of remaining APL stem cells for (A) 90 days of continued ATRA treatment and (B) 340 days of continued ATRA
treatment due to stochastic individual-based simulations with the parameters from Tables 1 and 2. After 340 days of ATRA treatment, almost 60% of
patients are expected to be cancer stem cell–free and thus potentially cured. The main panels shows the expected relapse time of patients where elimination of
cancer stem cells was not achieved, depending on the size of the remaining pool of cancer stem cells. These relapse times correspond well with observations
in clinical studies.

initially, as cells accumulate in the bone marrow, but only
weakly affect the output of normal hematopoietic cells (17).
The output of fully differentiated healthy cells only starts to
decrease slowly approximately 600 days after the occurrence of
the ﬁrst leukemic stem cell and diagnosis typically occurs after
approximately 870 days (2.4 years). This is substantially shorter
than the timescale for the clinical development of chronic
myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma or solid malignancies
such as colon cancer (3, 50).
We ﬁnd that chemotherapy provides a signiﬁcant initial
response but is unlikely to cure the disease, as a substantial
fraction of leukemic stem–like cells is expected to survive
treatment and leads to relapse of the disease. Indeed, we ﬁnd
several patients in the INT0129 trial that underwent three
cycles of chemotherapy (per protocol) but relapsed in time
intervals of approximately 100 to 300 days.
The model suggests that ATRA has differential effects on APL
stem–like cells compared with leukemic cells further downstream within its hierarchy. ATRA removes the differentiation
block and increases the proliferation rate of APL cells in the
bone marrow. This leads to a rapid expansion of most APL
progenitor cells and causes the typical bone marrow peak after
10 to 13 days of ATRA treatment. The bone marrow will appear
free of APL blasts after approximately 20 days. However, cure
requires the extinction of all APL stem–like cells. We ﬁnd, in line
with in vitro studies, that ATRA decreases the proliferation rate
of leukemic stem–like cells to 0.4 compared with untreated
leukemic stem–like cells and thus slows down the eradication
of APL stem–like cells. Thus, despite a fast initial response,
continued ATRA therapy is necessary to reduce the risk of
relapse. Our model suggests that, in the absence of additional
mutations, ATRA therapy for one year would result in a high
likelihood of eradication of all leukemic stem–like cells and thus
a cure in many patients. This is compatible with long-term
follow-up of patients on the INT0129 trial, where only 3.3% of

5394

Cancer Res; 74(19) October 1, 2014

patients who achieved complete remission experienced a late
relapse (deﬁned as occurring >3 years after diagnosis; ref. 37).
Our model in its current form does not consider the intrinsic
heterogeneity present in most leukemias or the emergence of
mutant subclones that may lead to relapse of the disease. Such
extensions of the model may be possible in the future but
require more detailed knowledge about the structure of the
tumor. Regardless, our modeling also illustrates the impact of
stochastic effects on the response to treatment, and in part
explains why outcomes can be vastly different between patients
with similar disease status at diagnosis, even without considerations of tumor evolution. However, our model suggests that
continued ATRA treatment can eventually eradicate all leukemic stem–like cells and thus potentially cure APL, and provides
for the ﬁrst time a time scale for the in vivo eradication of
leukemic stem–like cells in humans.
