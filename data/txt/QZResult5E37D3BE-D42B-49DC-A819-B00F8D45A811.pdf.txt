Abstract
The abundance of the multimeric vacuolar ATP-dependent proton pump, V-ATPase, on the plasma membrane
of tumor cells correlates with the invasiveness of the tumor cell, suggesting the involvement of V-ATPase in tumor
metastasis. V-ATPase is hypothesized to create a proton efﬂux leading to an acidic pericellular microenvironment
that promotes the activity of proinvasive proteases. An alternative, not yet explored possibility is that V-ATPase
regulates the signaling machinery responsible for tumor cell migration. Here, we show that pharmacologic or
genetic reduction of V-ATPase activity signiﬁcantly reduces migration of invasive tumor cells in vitro. Importantly, the V-ATPase inhibitor archazolid abrogates tumor dissemination in a syngeneic mouse 4T1 breast tumor
metastasis model. Pretreatment of cancer cells with archazolid impairs directional motility by preventing
spatially restricted, leading edge localization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as well as of
phosphorylated Akt. Archazolid treatment or silencing of V-ATPase inhibited Rac1 activation, as well as
Rac1-dependent dorsal and peripheral rufﬂes by inhibiting Rab5-mediated endocytotic/exocytotic trafﬁcking
of Rac1. The results indicate that archazolid effectively decreases metastatic dissemination of breast tumors by
impairing the trafﬁcking and spatially restricted activation of EGFR and Rho-GTPase Rac1, which are pivotal for
directed movement of cells. Thus, our data reveals a novel mechanism underlying the role of V-ATPase in tumor
dissemination. Cancer Res; 72(22); 5976–87. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer is a major cause of mortality primarily because of
tumor metastasis (1). The vacuolar (V)-ATPase is emerging as a
prominent player in the invasiveness of cancer cells (2, 3).
Consistently, pharmacologic inhibition of V-ATPase has been
proposed as a strategy to oppose metastatic processes (3–5).
V-ATPases are ATP-dependent proton pumps ubiquitously
expressed and thought to regulate the pH in endomembrane
systems. V-ATPase comprises 2 major domains: the cytoplasmic V1 domain, which consists of 8 subunits (A–H),
mediates ATP hydrolysis; the membrane-bound V0 subunit is

composed by subunits a, d, e, and the proteolipids c, c0 , and c00 .
The c subunits form an Hþ-binding rotor ring that transports
protons from the cytoplasm to the endosomal/lysosomal
lumen or the extracellular space (6, 7).
Few speciﬁc small molecule inhibitors of V-ATPase have
been developed and their binding properties have been extensively studied (8). The archazolids are a novel group of VATPase inhibitors, ﬁrst isolated from cultivated myxobacteria
Archangium gephyra (9). Like the known V-ATPase inhibitors
baﬁlomycin A1 or concanamycin, archazolids bind to the V0
subunit c of V-ATPase. However, the molecular mechanism of
their inhibitory action is different. Archazolids do not penetrate in between 2 c subunits, but most likely bind to the
membrane facing side of a single subunit c (10). Archazolids
potently inhibit V-ATPase activity (IC50: nanomolar range)
exerting little or no effects on Naþ/Kþ-ATPases and mitochondrial F-ATPases (8). To date, archazolid A, B, and F have
been isolated from their natural producer and archazolid A and
B have also been successfully chemically synthesized (9, 11–13).
It has been observed that the abundance of V-ATPase on the
plasma membrane correlates with an invasive phenotype of
tumor cells (3, 4). In addition, cell surface V-ATPase activity has
been postulated to create an acidic extracellular microenvironment, which is required for the activation of proteases
known to be important for tumor cell invasion (14). Consistent
with this, V-ATPase blockade reduces the activity of matrix
metalloproteinase MMP-9, albeit it increases MMP-2 in vitro

Cell Migration Defect by V-ATPase Inhibition

(4). Besides plasma membrane-localized V-ATPase, also intracellular V-ATPase may be involved in proteolytic activation
of proteases acting within the lysosome or facilitating the
trafﬁc of secretory vesicles containing MMPs or cathepsins
to the cell surface (2, 4, 15). Most of the work on V-ATPase in
tumor cell invasion has focused on the impact of this proton
pump on matrix degradation, whereas little has been done to
assess whether V-ATPase may also inﬂuence the signaling
leading to tumor cell motility and migration.
Cell migration is the result of a complex interplay of signaling machineries. Among these signaling axes, those emanating
from growth factor receptors, such as EGFR, are important for
directed migration, whereas Rho-GTPases, a subgroup of the
Ras superfamily of GTPases, regulate cell morphology, and
actin cytoskeleton, and are, therefore, indispensable for controlling the machinery of cell migration (16–18).
Here, we report that the V-ATPase inhibitor archazolid
hinders the migration of invasive cancer cells in vitro and in
vivo. We suggest that V-ATPase contributes to spatially
restricted activation of migratory transducers such as EGFR
and Rac1, which is required for the acquisition of polarized and
directed tumor cell migration.

Material and Methods
Compounds
Archazolid A was puriﬁed and isolated as described previously (9), archazolid B was synthesized chemically as described (ref. 12; Supplementary Fig. S1A). Both compounds
were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and show similar
bioactivity (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The following antibodies
were used: actin, cortactin and Rab5A (Santa Cruz), antipAkt/Akt, pEGFR/EGFR (cell signaling technologies), antiRac1 (Millipore), goat–anti–rabbit-488, goat–anti-mouse-488
and goat–anti-mouse-633 (AlexaFluor, Life technologies),
goat–anti-rabbit (Dianova), goat–anti-mouse IgG2b (Biozol).
Phalloidin rhodamine was purchased from Sigma.
Cell culture
The human breast cancer cell line SKBR3 was provided in
2009 by Dr. B. Mayer (University of Munich, Munich, Germany).
Cells were tested every 6 months for their estrogen receptor,
PgR, Her2, and EGFR status. Hela cells were from American
Type Culture Collection and routinely tested for Mycoplasma
contamination with MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit
(LONZA) and cell cross-contamination with StemElite ID
System (Promega). SKBR3 were maintained in McCoy's (PAA)
medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf
serum (FCS, Biochrom AG) and 1% glutamine. Hela cells were
grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% South American serum (EuroClone) and
1% L-glutamine. 4T1-Luc cells were recently (< 6 months)
purchased from Caliper (Alamenda, CA) and cultivated in
RPMI with 10% FCS.
Immunocytochemistry/ﬂow cytometry
SKBR3 cells were seeded on IBIDI-m-slides (IBIDI, Martinsried, Germany), ﬁxed with 4% formaldehyde (15 minutes, RT)
and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS. Antibodies

were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS containing 0.1%
Triton. For uptake of EGF-rhodamine (Invitrogen) archazolid
treated as well as control, cells were starved for 2 hours and
incubated for 5 to 15 minutes with EGF-rhodamine and
analyzed by confocal microscopy (LSM 510 Meta; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
For analysis of EGFR and Her2 on the plasma membrane
SKBR3 cells were treated with archazolid (10 nmol/L, 24
hours), trypsinized, washed with ice cold HEPES buffered
saline, labeled anti–EGFR (Fig. 2) antibody and AlexaFluor488-trastuzumab, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3)
and analyzed with FACScan ﬂow cytometer.
Rac1 activation assay
Rac1 was induced in cells treated with archazolid (24
hours, DMEM media) by adding epidermal growth factor
(EGF 100 ng/mL) for 2 minutes followed by a pull-down
assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc).
Western blot
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes using tank blotting. For the detection of protein levels, the ECL detection system (Amershan
Pharmacia Biotech) or the Odyssey Infrared Imaging system
version 2.1 (LI-COR Biosciences) was used.
Quantitative real-time PCR
The ABI 7300 RealTime PCR system with the TaqMan
Universal PCR Mastermix (Life Technologies Corporation) was
used. Probe and primers for the V-ATPase subunit c (ATP6L)
and GAPDH (housekeeping gene) were supplied as mix (Life
Technologies Corporation). Fluorescence increase was analyzed using the ABI 7300 system software. Calculation of
relative mRNA was done according to Pfafﬂ (19).
Measurement of apoptosis
Apoptotic cell death was quantiﬁed as described (20) permeabilizing cells, staining with propidiumiodide (50 mg/mL)
and analysis by ﬂow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton
Dickinson).
siRNA transfection
1  106 SKBR3 cells were transfected with control siRNA or
siRNA targeting ATP6L (Thermo Scientiﬁc Dharmacon) using
the Amaxa system. Downregulation of ATP6L was proved by
real-time PCR.
Liposome-based cell transfection (Fugene)
The Fugene transfection reagent (Roche) was used to transfect plasmids: pCMV-BamHI, pCMV-Rab5, pGFP-Rac1-C1,
1014, pRaichu-CRIB (CFP-CRIB-YFP/PAK-CRIB), pCDNA3Rac1-HA [wild-type Rac1 (RacWT)], and pCDNA3-RacQ61LHA [constitutive active Rac1 (RacQL)].
Boyden chamber assay
Cells were treated with archazolid at a conﬂuence of 70% for
24/16 hours. 1  105 cells were suspended in media without

FCS and added on top of the Boyden chamber membrane
(Corning). Culture medium with 10% FCS was added on the
bottom of the membrane. Chambers were incubated at 37 C,
5% CO2 for 4 hours. Migrated cells were ﬁxed and stained with
crystal violet/methanol. Cells not migrated were removed with
a q-tip. Pictures (10 magniﬁcations) were taken and migrated
cells were counted and normalized to control cells (100%
migration). For control purpose, cells were not exposed to
FCS gradient (Co, 0% migration).
Chemotaxis
SKBR3 cells (5  106) were seeded with media containing
2% FCS on IBIDI chemotaxis m-slides and allowed to attach
for 16 hours. FCS gradient and chemotaxis analysis was conducted as described before (21).
Cell adhesion/xCelligence
4  104 SKBR3 cells/well were allowed to adhere on ﬁbronectin coated IBIDI m-slides (30 minutes, 37 C) and ﬁxed with
4% paraformaldehyde. Pictures were taken using the Axiovert,
Zeiss, and number of adhered cells was counted.
For impedance/adherence time measurement 5  103 cells/
well were seeded in the respective electrode plate (xCelligence,
Roche, E-Plate 16). Cell impedance was monitored and adhesion time analyzed using the manufacturer's software (Software RTCA 1.2.1).
In vivo experiments
Twenty female BALB/cByJRj mice (Janvier) were housed in
individually ventilated cages with a 12 hours day/night cycle and
food and water ad libitum. Mice were inoculated with 1  105
4T1-Luc cells via the tail vein. Twenty-four and 4 hours before
tumor cell injection the treatment group (n ¼ 10) was medicated with 1 mg/kg archazolid (5% DMSO/PBS) intravenously.
On day 8, after tumor cell inoculation bioluminescence imaging
of the mice was conducted under anesthesia (2% isoﬂurane in
oxygen) using the IVIS Lumina system with Living Image
software 3.2 (Caliper Life Sciences) 15 minutes after intraperitoneal injection of 6 mg Na-luciferin (Promega). Mice were
sacriﬁced through cervical dislocation; lungs were harvested,
weighed, and imaged. Regions of Interest (ROI) were deﬁned
and the total signal per ROI was calculated as photons/second/
cm2 (total ﬂux/area). All animal experiments were conducted
according to the guidelines of the German law for protection of
animal life and approved by the local ethics committee.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were conducted at least 3 times in duplicates/triplicates. Results are expressed as mean value  SEM.
One-way ANOVA/Dunnett and individual students t tests were
conducted using GraphPadPrism. P values less than 0.05 were
considered as signiﬁcant.

Results
Archazolid inhibits cell migration

MB 231 as well of the pancreatic cancer cell line L3.6pl using
either Boyden chamber (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. S2A) or
wound healing-type of assays (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Importantly, archazolid, at all the concentrations and timepoints
tested, had no effects on cell survival (Fig. 1A, Supplementary
S2A bottom right). Archazolid affects chemotaxis of SKBR3
cells exposed to a diffusive gradient of FCS (0%–10%; Fig. 1B).
Whereas control cells move toward the highest FCS concentration, cells treated with archazolid clearly display reduced
directional migration (expressed as y-forward migration
index). Only slight alterations in the cumulative distance and
in the velocity of cell movement are observed suggesting that
directed migration rather than cell mobility is mainly affected
by archazolid.
Archazolid affects EGFR cellular distribution and cell
polarization
Growth factor receptors, including the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), play a crucial role in directed cell
migration as conﬁrmed by using an EGFR inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S4). Whereas the amount of EGFR protein on the
cell surface increased upon archazolid treatment (24
hours; Fig. 2A left, Supplementary Fig. S3), the total amount
of EGFR was unchanged (Fig. 2A right) and was still able to be
activated as indicated by phosphorylation at Tyr 1068,
although the extent and kinetic of activation were slightly
decreased (Fig. 2A bottom). Conversely, we observed dramatic
changes of EGFR surface distribution after archazolid treatment by confocal microscopy analysis of notpermeabilized
cells. In control cells, EGFR localizes and is enriched at the
leading edge of migrating cells. In archazolid-treated cells, in
contrast, EGFR was distributed all over the cell surface and
failed to accumulate along the leading edge extending in the
direction of migration. This altered cellular distribution of
EGFR likely reﬂects archazolid inhibition of lamellipodia
extension as revealed by antiactin staining (Fig. 2C left).
Furthermore, the localization of the microtubule-organizing
center (MTOC) was affected. Whereas in control cells the
MTOC is localized at the very front of the nucleus in the
direction of migration, the MTOC of archazolid treated cells
was randomly positioned with respect to the nucleus and the
front of migration (Fig. 2C right).
We tested if archazolid affects EGFR internalization and
trafﬁcking, which may in turn control EGFR signaling to actin
remodeling. EGFR is rapidly internalized upon ligand binding.
However, in archazolid treated cells EGFR internalization was
signiﬁcantly delayed (Fig. 3A) paralleled by a delay in maximal
activation and a signiﬁcant reduction in the duration of Akt
signaling in archazolid treated cells (Fig. 3B). Likewise for
EGFR, the polarized distribution of activated Akt in migrating
cells was signiﬁcantly impaired (Fig. 3C).
Archazolid inhibits rufﬂe formation by preventing Rac1
activation
Cells that attach and spread on ECM substrates are known
to activate signaling pathways and undergo morphologic
changes in their shape and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton that recapitulate events typical of migratory cells (22).

contrast to control, archazolid-treated cells were signiﬁcantly
less efﬁcient in spreading and failed to form prominent actin
rich peripheral lamellipodia and rufﬂes.
Lamellipodia extension and rufﬂe formation are primarily
controlled by the Rho GTPase Rac1, which localizes to leading
edges to promote these migratory structures. Thus, we tested
whether archazolid may affect either the localization or activation (or both) of Rac1. Confocal analysis of freshly adherent
control cells showed a distinct localization of Rac1, which, as
expected, accumulated at the cell periphery where actin-rich

lamellipodial sheets are localized. Archazolid completely abrogated the distribution of Rac1 to the plasma membrane most
likely because the peripheral enrichment of ﬁlamentous actin
(rufﬂes) also disappears upon archazolid treatment (Fig. 4B,
right). A similar picture was observed in migrating cells in a
scratch assay. Under these conditions, archazolid inhibited the
formation of wound–directed, Rac1-, cortactin-, and F-actin–
positive polarized lamellipodia (Fig. 4D). All these morphologic
phenotypes can be easily accounted by a direct inhibitory
effect of archazolid on Rac1 activation. Consistent with this

hypothesis, EGF–induced Rac-GTP levels were signiﬁcantly
reduced by archazolid treatment (Fig. 4C), suggesting that
pathways leading to the activation of this GTPase are a primary
target of archazolid action. This is further supported by overexpression of either RacWT or RacQL, which could both rescue
the inhibition of migration caused by archazolid (Fig. 4F).
Downregulation of V-ATPase subunit c inhibits
migration and Rac1 activation
Archazolid binds to the V-ATPase subunit c. To unequivocally establish that the effects of archazolid are because of the
inhibition of V-ATPase subunit c, we genetically silenced the V0
subunit c (ATP6L) using siRNA. Downregulation of ATP6L
impaired both cell migration and polarized lamellipodia and
rufﬂe formation observed in a scratch wound healing assay
(Fig. 5A and B). This effect is not cell type speciﬁc, as pancreatic
cancer cells L3.6pl were equally inhibited by silencing of ATP6L
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Notably and similar to archazolid,
silencing of ATP6L inhibited both the activation of Rac1 (Fig.
5C) and its accumulation at the leading edge of migrating
SKBR3 cells because of loss of rufﬂes (Fig. 5B, right). These
results support the hypothesis that the V-ATPase subunit c
plays a crucial role during the migration process by critically
participating in the activation of Rac1.

V-ATPase-inhibition affects Rab5-induced Rac1
activation
Recently, the recycling molecule Rab5 has been reported to
play an important role in the activation of the Rac1–mediated
actin remodeling and cell migration (23). In keeping with these
observations, we show that Rab5 is sufﬁcient to induce the
formation of Rac1-dependent actin-rich migratory structures,
including circular dorsal rufﬂes and peripheral rufﬂes (Fig. 6A).
Thus, we tested whether archazolid interfered also with Rab5evoked morphologic changes. Both, peripheral and circular
dorsal rufﬂe formation was signiﬁcantly reduced in Rab5expressing Hela cells after 24 hours of archazolid treatment
(Fig. 6A). Similarly, Rab5-mediated activation of Rac1 (Fig. 6B
left) was signiﬁcantly inhibited by archazolid treatment (Fig.
6B right).
In Rab5-expressing, untreated cells, Rac1 can, as previously reported (23), localize to enlarged early endosomes
[revealed by the presence of the early endosome antigen-1
(EEA1)] (Fig. 6C left). Treatment with archazolid, however,
prevented the accumulation of Rac1 on Rab5 vesicles, as
revealed both by directly monitoring Rac1 cellular distribution (Supplementary Fig. S6) or using a Rac1 biosensor
(PAK-CRIB) that speciﬁcally binds to activated Rac1 (Fig.
6C right).

Archazolid inhibits metastasis in vivo
To extend the relevance of the inhibitory effects of archazolid on chemotactic migration and cell invasion, we next
tested whether this drug was effective in impairing cancer
dissemination in xenograft mouse models. To this end, we used
the 4T1-Luc syngeneic metastatic mouse breast cancer model
(24–27). This model is based on the 4T1-Luc mouse mammary
tumor cell line, which when injected intravenously disseminates to distant organs, homing to lungs, liver, bone, and brain
over a short period of time. These cells are engineered to
express a luciferase reporter to enable real time monitoring of
developing tumor by live imaging. Under these conditions,
mock treated, 4T1-injected animals formed easily detectable
lung metastases, which were drastically inhibited by intrave-

Discussion
This study gives evidence for a role of V-ATPase in
tumor metastasis and reveals novel molecular
mechanisms of its action, which are depicted in a
cartoon (Supplementary Fig. S8)
It has been reported for breast and pancreatic cancer cells
that the abundance of V-ATPase on the plasma membrane
correlates with an invasive phenotype (3, 28–31). Our observation that V-ATPase is localized on the plasma membrane of
the invasive cancer cell line SKBR3, but not in the nontumor

is consistent with this notion. Genetic knock down of ATP6L
leads both to the disappearance of V-ATPase at the leading
edge of breast cancer cells as well as to a signiﬁcant decrease
of their migratory activity extending and corroborating data
by Lu and colleagues using hepatocellular carcinoma cells
(32).
With respect to the mode of action of V-ATPase in cancer
metastasis, one currently accepted model invokes that VATPase, highly concentrated on the cell surface, may provide
a localized proton efﬂux, thus generating an acidic extracellular microenvironment, which is, in turn, favorable for the
activation of a variety of proinvasive proteases (4, 33).

Our work unveils an alternative mode of action for VATPase. We propose that V-ATPase regulates the signaling
machinery responsible for tumor cell migration. More specifically, we showed that V-ATPase inhibition by archazolid
impairs spatial restriction of migratory signaling molecules
such as Rac1 and EGFR, which is pivotal for directed and
polarized cell movement.
Spatial restriction of signaling, achieved by redistributing
signaling molecules to conﬁned areas of the plasma membrane
(e.g., leading edge) upon chemotactic stimuli, has emerged as
essential for directed cell migration (17). Within this context,
endocytosis has been recently proposed to serve as an integrated trafﬁcking network to direct where signaling molecules

are activated and is thus important for virtually all polarized
functions, ﬁrst and foremost cell migration (34). Consistently
endo/exocytic cycles of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as
EGFR, are essential for guided motility (35, 36). EGFR is also
a potent guidance receptor, which induces actin remodeling
leading to the formation of various migratory protrusions such
lamellipodia (peripheral rufﬂes) or dorsal surface circular
rufﬂes, an obligatory step for 2-dimensional cell motility
(16). Own experiments using an EGFR inhibitor support this
notion (Supplementary Fig. S4).
V-ATPase inhibition by archazolid in migrating tumor cells
alters EGFR localization, reduces its internalization, and
impairs EGFR downstream signaling by ablating Akt activation
and preventing its accumulation at the leading edge. These
combined effects, ultimately, impact on the ability of cells to
polarize. Not surprisingly, the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a major
role in the migratory programs of cells (17).
Notably, a general inﬂuence of V-ATPase inhibition on
internalization as well as recycling processes has been reported

before (37, 38). This ﬁnding was also conﬁrmed for archazolid,
which inhibits uptake of dextran, but not of transferrin/transferrin-R after short time of treatment, however, abrogates
transferrin/transferrin-R uptake after prolonged exposure
(Supplementary Fig. S10A and S10B).
About mechanisms underlying V-ATPase action on internalization/recycling, it is important to know that endosomes
and lysosomes, where recycling and degradation takes place,
are acidiﬁed by V-ATPases (39). The acidic pH is pivotal for the
dissociation of ligands from its receptors and degradation/
recycling processes (35). Increase of pH induced by baﬁlomycin, for example, has been shown to affect the delivery of
endocytosed molecules to late endosomes or lysosomes in
some, but not all cell lines tested (37, 40, 41). We analyzed
SKBR3 cells by transmission electron microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S10C) and found considerably more and enlarged
multivesicular bodies (MVB) in cells after archazolid treatment. MVBs are degradative endosomal organelles, mediating
trafﬁcking between early and late endosomes (40, 42).

Interestingly, this phenomenon was also described in a study
focusing on the involvement of V-ATPase activity in Notch
Signaling (42). As an even more acidic pH is necessary for
lysosomal degradation process, V-ATPase inhibition by archazolid might inhibit the ﬁnal fusion with lysosomes, halting the
degradative, and probably also recycling routes, leading to
enlargement of MVBs. Likely these "high pH" MVB are inefﬁcient degradative factory that may trap cargos and endosomal
associated molecules that would otherwise be routed to recycling pathways for subsequent round of signaling. Ultimately,
this may result in an impaired delivery of internalized molecules, such as EGFR, to the proper location on the plasma
membrane preventing their proper and sustained activation.
Similar alteration in trafﬁcking of endosomal membrane associated molecules recycling back to the plasma membrane may
also occur for impaired activation of Rac1, which after archazolid treatment, is no longer able to enter the Rab5-mediated
endosomal routes for subsequent delivery back to the plasma
membrane. How changes in endosomal pH affect Rac1 recruit-

ment to these organelles is unclear at this stage. One possibility
is that local changes of the pH at the plasma membrane, where
Rac1 or its GEFs are primarily localized and activated, are
required for Rac1 (or its activators) to subsequently enter
endocytic organelles. Indeed similar reduction of Rac1 in
endosomes could be observed after interference with clathrin
(23) suggesting that plasma membrane localized Rac may
follow a canonical endocytic routes that may require local
changes of pH to be effective. Whether this is indeed the case
remains, however, to be tested in future investigations.
Whatever the case, impaired endocytic trafﬁc induced by VATPase is hypothesized to affect the spatially restricted activation of Rac1, a central regulator of actin remodeling and cell
migration (17, 43). Consistently, archazolid treatment or
silencing the V0 subunit c of the V-ATPase, the binding site
of archazolid, abrogate Rac1-dependent F-actin remodeling, Factin–mediated formation of rufﬂes or lamellipodia as well as
the recruitment of active Rac1 to these migratory structures.
These results also show that archazolid exerts its effect by

speciﬁcally targeting V-ATPase, or more precisely of the V0
subunit c.
Spatial restriction of Rac1 signaling has been shown to
depend on Rab5 endo/exocitic cycles (23). Rab5, in addition
to be a master regulator of endocytosis (44) by controlling
the biogenesis and fate of early endosomes, was also shown
to be sufﬁcient to promote, through Rac1, the formation of
a diverse set of migratory protrusions, including lamellipodia and circular dorsal rufﬂes (23). Notably, archazolid
robustly inhibits all these structures. These effects are
accompanied by loss of Rac1 from endosomal membrane,
which results in reduced delivery of this GTPase to cell
protrusion, and impaired directional migration. Thus, archazolid appears to interfere both with endocytic trafﬁcking
of Rac1 as well as EGFR. Whether EGFR needs to be
internalized and recycled to trigger Rac1 internalization
and activation or the 2 events are occurring at the same
time independently of each other remains to be addressed
in future work.
Finally, as in vivo data on V-ATPase inhibitors are very
limited, we like to point to the fact that effects of archazolid
in cell culture are recapitulated in a mouse model of tumor
dissemination. This indicates that pharmacologic interference
with V-ATPase represents a viable strategy both to decipher
functions of this enzyme in cancer progression as well as to
prevent the acquisition of migratory and invasive properties,
ultimately leading to metastasis.
