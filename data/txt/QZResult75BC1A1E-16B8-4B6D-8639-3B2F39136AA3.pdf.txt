BACKGROUND: Internal tandem duplication of FMS-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3-ITD) is well known to be involved in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression, but FLT3-ITD–negative AML cases account for 70% to 80% of AML, and the mechanisms underlying their
pathology remain unclear. This study identifies protein tyrosine phophatase PRL-3 as a key mediator of FLT3-ITD–negative AML.
METHODS: A total of 112 FLT3-ITD–negative AML patients were sampled between 2010 and 2013, and the occurrence of PRL-3 hyperexpression in FLT3-ITD–negative AML was evaluated by multivariate probit regression analysis. Overexpression or depletion of endogenous PRL-3 expression with the specific small interfering RNAs was performed to investigate the role of PRL-3 in AML progression.
Xenograft models were also used to confirm the oncogenic role of PRL-3. RESULTS: Compared to healthy donors, PRL-3 is upregulated more than 3-fold in 40.2% of FLT3-ITD–negative AML patients. PRL-3 expression level is adversely correlated to the overall survival of the AML patients, and the AML relapses accompany with re-upregulation of PRL-3. Mechanistically, aberrant PRL-3
expression promoted cell cycle progression and enhanced the antiapoptotic machinery of AML cells to drug cytotoxicity through
downregulation of p21 and upregulation of Cyclin D1 and CDK2 and activation of STAT5 and AKT. Depletion of endogenous PRL-3
sensitizes AML cells to therapeutic drugs, concomitant with apoptosis by upregulation of cleaved PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase) and apoptosis-related caspases. Xenograft assays further confirmed PRL-3’s oncogenic role in leukemogenesis. CONCLUSIONS:
Our results demonstrated that PRL-3 is a novel independent crucial player in both FLT3-ITD–positive and FLT3-ITD–negative AML

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by a differentiation block and the accumulation of immature cells, resulting in the failure of normal hematopoiesis1 with series of somatic genetic alterations leading to a complicated and heterogeneous disease.2,3 It is believed that the pathogenesis of AML typically requires at least 2 genetic lesions: one which
impairs differentiation, such as the AML1-ETO mutation; and the other which promotes proliferation, for instance such
as that afforded by the activated KIT or FMS-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) mutation which is detected in approximately
20% of AML.3 Although insights into the genetic alterations could lead to the improved diagnosis and therapy for AML
patients with poor prognosis, the therapeutic outcomes in AML still remain unsatisfactory. Most patients ultimately
relapse and long-term survival is seen in approximately 30% to 40% of younger AML patients aged less than 60 years, but
only 5% to 10% in the elderly patients aged 60 years and older.4-6 The conventional cytarabine-based therapy in conjunction with stem cell transplantation is not suitable to all patients, due to the unselective damage to normal tissue cells and
the immunological rejection problems, respectively.7 To improve the therapeutic efficiency to AML patients, it is necessary to thoroughly understand the underlying mechanism and to identify more genes as potential biomarkers and targets
for the individualized AML diagnosis and treatment.

PRL-3 Promotes FLT3-ITD–Negative AML Progression/Qu et al

Protein tyrosine phosphatase of regenerating liver 3
(PRL-3, PTP4A3) is one of the members of the cysteinebased protein tyrosine phosphatases,8 and is highly
expressed in various solid tumors as a biomarker, including colon, breast, ovary, liver, stomach tumors.9-14 Moreover, PRL-3 has been demonstrated to play important
roles in cancer cell proliferation, motility, metastasis, invasiveness, and tumor angiogenesis.15-18 Growing evidence
has indicated that high PRL-3 expression is an adverse
prognostic factor for recurrence, overall survival, and
disease-free survival.19-21 Our previous study suggested
that PRL-3 as a metastasis-associated phosphatase, is
involved in reinforcing PI3K/Akt activation, consequently
promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.22 PRL-3 is
also reported as a regulator of H3K9 methylation by affecting the activities of JMJD1B and JMJD2B in colorectal tumorigenesis.23 PRL-3 overexpression is also seen in
hematopoietic malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and multiple myeloma.24,25 In addition, PRL3 is involved in leukemogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia as a downstream target of BCR-ABL signaling pathway.26 Besides, PRL-3 protein is upregulated in 47% of
AML cases with internal tandem duplication of FLT3
(FLT3-ITD), as a downstream effector of FLT3-ITD to
confer therapeutic resistance through upregulation of
STAT and antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein,27 or by FLT3ITD-STAT5 signaling pathways.28 However, whether
PRL-3 independently participates in FLT3-ITD–negative
AML progression is not known. FLT3-ITD–negative leukemia is the major subgroup of AML and accounts for up
to 70% to 80% of all cases,29 the effective treatment to this
subgroup will definitely improve the overall AML therapy
efficiency.
In this study, we screened PRL-3 expression in clinical FLT3-ITD–negative AML samples and analyzed the
relationship of PRL-3 expression in clinical variables and
evaluated the prognostic value of PRL-3 in FLT3-ITD–
negative AML. Meanwhile, the effects of PRL-3 in cell
proliferation, cell cycle, cellular apoptosis, drug resistance,
and leukemogenesis were thoroughly investigated.

groups, including the de novo group of 86 cases and the
relapsed/refractory group of 26 cases. The main clinical
features of the patients are listed in Table 1. Meanwhile,
16 healthy donors were recruited, which was approved by
the medical ethical committee of the University. Complete remission is defined as  5% leukemic blast cells in
the bone marrow. Relapse is defined as the recurrence
of  5% blasts in the bone marrow. Disease-free survival
(DFS) was considered from the diagnosis to the relapse or
death for any cause, with observation censored for patients
last known to be alive without report of relapse.

RESULTS
PRL-3 Is Upregulated in FLT3-ITD–Negative
AML Patients and Cells

PRL-3 was shown to be upregulated in FLT3-ITD positive AML as its downstream effector.27 In order to explore
whether PRL-3 aberrantly expresses in the FLT3-ITD–
negative AML, we evaluated PRL-3 mRNA expression in
112 FLT3-ITD–negative AML patients by quantitative
RT-PCR. Compared to the 16 normal healthy donors,
the PRL-3 mRNA expression was overall increased in the
bone marrow blast cells of AML patients (median 13.464

versus 5.542, P 5 .002, Fig. 1A), and the averaged value
of PRL-3 expression of 16 healthy donors was 6.223,
compared to the averaged value of 18.670 seen in the 112
patients. We defined the average expression level (18.670)
of AML cases as a cutoff threshold to classify the patients
into 2 groups, designated as low and high PRL-3 expression. Of them, 45 individual cases (40.2%) showed high
PRL-3 expression. Additional analysis indicated that the
26 relapsed/refractory AML patients expressed higher
PRL-3 than did the 86 newly diagnosed patients (median
of 21.110 versus 11.076, P < .001, Fig. 1B). Furthermore, in 30 AML patients, the PRL-3 expression level at
their first complete remission was significantly lower than
that observed when they were initially diagnosed (median,
12.115 versus 20.717, paired t test, P < .001, Fig. 1C).
Accordingly, PRL-3 protein expression level is obviously
higher in a majority of AML patients than that observed
in healthy donors (Fig. 1D), confirming the results of
PRL-3 mRNA expression. Meanwhile, we observed that
PRL-3 protein was not only detected in FLT3-ITD–
positive cell lines MOLM-13 and MV4-11, but also in
FLT3-ITD–negative cell lines, especially in ML-1 (Fig.
1E). PRL-3 protein in ML-1 cells was further stained by
immunofluorescence (Fig. 1F). Thereafter, endogenous
PRL-3 in ML-1 was silenced to characterize its function
in this study. All above results demonstrated that PRL-3 is
generally upregulated in FLT3-ITD–negative AML.
PRL-3 Promotes FLT3-ITD–Negative Cell
Proliferation

To examine the possible roles of PRL-3 in AML occurrence,
especially in the AML cell proliferation, we ectopically
expressed PRL-3 and its phosphatase-dead mutant (C104S)
in FLT3-ITD–negative cell lines U937 and ML-1. Meanwhile, the endogenous PRL-3 was silenced in ML-1 cells.
Immunoblotting results confirmed the ectopic expression of
PRL-3 in these 2 stable cell lines (Fig. 2A,B); furthermore,
depletion of endogenous PRL-3 was also successful (Fig.
2C). Cell proliferation assays showed that PRL-3 rather
than its phosphatase-dead mutant PRL-3 (C104S) promoted the proliferation of U937 and ML-1 cells, compared
with the control cells (Vector) (P < .05; Fig. 2D,E). Conversely, depletion of endogenous PRL-3 significantly suppressed ML-1 cell proliferation (P < .05; Fig. 2F),
indicating that PRL-3 can enhance AML cell proliferation.
Overexpressing PRL-3 led to clearly more colonies,
compared to cells expressing either PRL-3(C104S) or the
empty vector (Vector) in both U937 and ML-1 cells (Fig.
2G,H), whereas PRL-3 depletion in ML-1 cells significantly blocked colony formation (P < .01, Fig. 2I), demCancer

onstrating that PRL-3 can promote cell proliferation and
tumorigenesis.
PRL-3 Enhances FLT3-ITD–Negative AML Cell
Cycle

To evaluate the effect of PRL-3 on the FLT3-ITD–
negative cell cycle progression, flow cytometry analysis
was performed. PRL-3 overexpression clearly enhanced
cell cycle progression by lowering the cell population in
G0/G1 phase and increasing that in S phase in U937 and
ML-1 cells (Fig. 3A,B). By contrast, knockdown of PRL3 arrested cell progression in G0/G1 phase and decreased
cell population in the S phase (P < .05, Fig. 3C). These
results indicate that silencing PRL-3 in the AML cells
could inhibit cell growth. To explore the underlying
mechanism of PRL-3 in AML cell proliferation, we
checked the expression of the cell cycle regulatory molecules. The results showed that overexpression of PRL-3
upregulated CDK2 and Cyclin D1 expression, and
decreased p21 expression (Fig. 3D), indicating that PRL3 may be an important player in cell cycle regulation.
PRL-3 Exerts Antiapoptosis and Drug
Resistance

To further investigate the effect of PRL-3 in drug therapy
of the AML, PRL-3 overexpressing U937 and ML-1 cells
were treated with Ara-C for 72 hours. PRL-3 overexpression counteracted the drug sensitivity of AML cells to AraC, but the PRL-3 mutant (C104S) did not (Fig. 4A,B). In
addition, knockdown of the endogenous PRL-3 obviously
sensitized cells to the cytotoxicity of the drug (Fig. 4C).
PRL-3 effects on drug resistance and cell apoptosis was further explored. Aberrant upregulation of wild-type PRL3
but not its mutant form sufficiently neutralized Ara-C and
daunorubicin (DNR)-induced apoptosis (P < .05, Fig.
4D,E). As expected, PRL-3 depletion significantly sensitized cells to death by this drug (P < .05, Fig. 4F). Given
that PRL-3 is implicated in antiapoptosis,31 the expression
of apoptosis-related proteins were checked. Upon Ara-C
treatment, the apoptotic proteins PARP, caspase-9, and
caspase-3 were clearly activated in ML-1 cells where the
expression of endogenous PRL-3 was silenced by siRNA
(Fig. 4G). Because PRL-3 can activate STAT5 to confer
antiapoptosis effect in FLT3-ITD positive AML cell,27 we
asked if PRL-3 functions in FLT3-ITD–negative cells in a
similar manner. Our immunoblotting results showed that
PRL-3 can effectively enhance STAT5 phosphorylation
(Fig. 4H). Moreover, activation of PI3K/AKT pathway is
well known to be involved in survival, the phosphorylation
status of AKT and its downstream effectors were checked

in these FLT3-ITD–negative AML cells. In line with our
observation in other solid tumor cells,22 PRL-3 overexpression could activate AKT to some extent, rather than the
further downstream effectors, including 4E-BP1 and
p70S6K in both ML-1 and U937 cells (Fig. 4H). Taken
together, all above results demonstrate that PRL-3 exerts

formation by ML-1 cells when assayed at the 20th day after subcutaneous inoculation (Fig. 5A and Supporting
Fig. S1A). To further characterize the molecular events in
these cancer cells, wild-type and PRL-3–silenced ML-1
cells were evaluated by immunoblotting with other
markers and the results showed that endogenous PRL-3
depletion can efficiently decrease Ki67 expression (Supporting Fig. S2) whereas increases Bax expression (SupCancer

formation may be due to the blocked cell proliferation in
vivo. By contrast, overexpressing PRL-3 markedly
enhanced tumorigenesis in the nude mice only on the

obtained in U937 cells (Fig. 5C and Supporting Fig.

PRL-3 Is an Independent Factor for
FLT3-ITD–Negative AML Progression

To confirm our results regarding the clinical relevance of
PRL-3 in AML pathogenesis, the relationships of PRL-3
expression to various clinical features indicated and summarized in Table 1, in which patients with poor risk was
29.5% of the total enrolled cases. Further association analysis of PRL-3 to other clinical features was assessed individually. PRL-3 expression is significantly correlated with
FAB category (P 5 .002), CD7 expression (P 5 .017)
(Table 2). PRL-3 was more highly expressed in M4/M5
FAB category than in non-M4/M5. PRL-3 mRNA
expression in patients with CD7 positivity was higher
than in CD7 negativity. There was no statistically significant difference in PRL-3 expression by WBC count, cytogenetic risk or CD56 expression. Taken together, our
results show that PRL-3 could be considered as an independent factor for the diagnosis and prognosis, regardless
of other features, including the status of FLT3-ITD.

of the patients in the PRL-3 high-expression group was
only 16.3%, whereas the survival rate in the PRL-3 lowexpression group is up to 53.5% in the 40-month period
from the first remission (Fig. 6), demonstrating that PRL-3
is inversely well-correlated to the overall survival of FLT3ITD–negative AML patients (P 5 .001, n580).
We also investigated the association between the
clinical features and DFS, and performed univariate and
multivariate Cox regression analysis. The DFS was statistically significantly correlated with PRL-3 expression, age,
CD34 expression, CD7 expression, and cytogenetic risk
(Table 3). Multivariate analysis showed that PRL-3
expression (hazard ratio [HR] 5 1.609; P 5 .035), cytogenetic risk (HR 5 2.143; P 5 .014), and CD34 expression (HR 5 2.089; P 5 .000) were also independent

PRL-3 Expression Level Is Inversely Correlated
to Patient Survival

To examine the prognostic significance of PRL-3 expression, we performed a follow-up study on 80 patients with
de novo AML, with 3-fold of the averaged PRL-3 expression level (18.670) in healthy donors as a cutoff value. Of
these 80, 27 patients were classified into the PRL-3 highexpression group (PRL-3 expression  18.670) and 53
patients in the low-expression group (PRL-3
expression < 18.670). Disease-free survival (DFS) was then
performed with the Kaplan-Meier method. The DFS rate

predictors for DFS, respectively, but no CD7 expression.
Therefore, PRL-3 could be a novel independent prognostic factor.
DISCUSSION
FLT3-ITD–negative AML accounts for 70% to 80% of
all AML cases,29 but the mechanism of its occurrence and
progression still remain elusive. In this study, we provided
several lines of evidence demonstrating that like FLT3ITD, phosphatase PRL-3 alone can also enhance the
AML progression by promoting leukemia cell proliferation and antiapoptosis ability even under cytotoxic drug
stress. In vivo xenograft results of PRL-3 in AML pathogenesis also confirmed this conclusion, because PRL-3
depletion significantly blocked the invasiveness of the
assayed AML cells (Fig. 5D,E), indicating that PRL-3
plays an important role in AML progression. In line with
this, the relevance analysis of the clinical AML cases
revealed that PRL-3 expression level is adversely correlated
to patients’ overall survival, emphasizing its independent
role in AML progression.
Accumulated evidence indicates that FLT3-ITD
functions in approximately 20% of AML as driver mutations, and screening FLT3-ITD could benefit to select the
more accurate prognostic criteria and therapeutic strategies.32,33 PRL-3 as a downstream effector of FLT3-ITD
and STAT5 is upregulated in approximately 47% of this
positive AML subgroup, rather than the FLT3-ITD–
negative group,27,28 indicating that PRL-3 just functions
in a supplementary or accessory alliance with FLT3-ITD
to drive AML pathogenesis. By contrast, in our study, we
found that PRL-3 mRNA and protein expression are upregulated more than 3-fold in 40.2% of the FLT3-ITD–
negative AML compared to that of the healthy donors,
and PRL-3 attenuation obviously delayed the AML progression in nude mice, indicating that PRL-3 could be

another novel promoter of AML pathology, independent
of FLT3-ITD status. The observation of higher PRL-3
expression in refractory/relapsed AML reinforced this
notion (Fig. 1B). Moreover, PRL-3 mRNA expression is
associated with a poor prognosis in both univariate and
multivariate analysis for DFS, because the survival rate in
PRL-3 high group is much less than that in the low group,
which are consistent with the function of PRL-3 in FLT3ITD–positive cases.28 Therefore, the notion that PRL-3
expression was unchanged in FLT3-ITD–negative AML
cases28 seems invalid, due to the distinct analysis. Ignoring
the key function of PRL-3 would not benefit FLT3-ITD–
negative AML prognosis and therapy.
Mechanistically, PRL-3 promotes cell proliferation
and migration by downregulating Csk, leading to Src activation.34 We have also demonstrated that PRL-3 initiates
tumor angiogenesis by recruiting vascular endothelial cells
instead of its mutant.15 In this study, we reproducibly
showed that elevated PRL-3 expression promotes FLT3ITD negative AML cell proliferation, rather than the catalytically inactive PRL-3 (C104S) mutant, uncovering
PRL-3’s phosphatase-dependent function in AML progression. PRL-3 depletion induces G1 arrest and sensitizes
the AML cells to anticancer drugs. By contrast, PRL-3 upregulation decreased the sensitivity to cytotoxic agents
and shielded the cell apoptosis even under direct cytotoxic
stress. Therefore, our results further suggest that PRL-3
per se can be another novel causal factor for AML progression, as PRL-3 silencing can succeed against the AML
pathogenesis in vivo, which is consistent with the clinical
relevance of PRL-3 to AML prognosis (Fig. 6 and Table
3). Collectively, our findings indicate that PRL-3 may
play critical roles in cell proliferation and drug resistance
by antiapoptosis and enhancement of cell proliferation in
FLT3-ITD–negative AML progression, thus PRL-3
should be also considered as a therapeutic target.

Original Article

Regarding the promotion of cell proliferation and
the apoptosis evasion by PRL-3, the involved detailed
questions that how PRL-3, as a non–transcription factor,
upregulates the expression of cell cycle–related cyclin D1,
CDK and suppresses P21 to enhance AML cell cycle
needs to be further investigated. Similarly, the association
analysis of PRL-3 mRNA expression to the clinical feature
showed that PRL-3 expression is correlated to CD7
expression in FLT3-ITD–negative AML (Table 2), indicating that PRL-3 could synergize with CD7 to promote
AML progression. However, the multivariant analysis of
disease-free survival of FLT3-ITD negative AML showed
that PRL-3 expression is significantly correlated to the
disease-free survival, but not CD7 expression (Table 3),
hinting that PRL-3 plays dominant role in the AML progression than CD7 does. Therefore, the CD7 expression
could be somehow regulated by PRL-3 in FLT3-ITD–
negative AML to certain extend, as PRL-3 is involved in
NF-jB activation35 and other pathways,17 or in proteosome degradation36 or epigenetic chromatin modification23 to regulate a particular gene expression. Whether
PRL-3 is interplaying with CD7 together or functioning
independently is worth investigating clearly.
Given that PRL-3 is also upregulated in FLT3ITD–negative AML, it seems that PRL-3 could be upregulated by several other factors apart from FLT3-ITD in
AML. Results presented in this study show that PRL-3
overexpression can activate STAT5 (Fig. 4H) in FLT3ITD–negative AML cells, which may in turn upregulate
PRL-3 expression, as reported.28 Moreover, the wellknown tumor suppressor p53, which is frequently
mutated in various solid tumors37 and AML,2 has been
shown to directly regulate PRL-3 at the transcriptional
level.38 PRL-3 is a downstream effector of BCR-ABL signaling pathway in chronic myeloid leukemia,26 and
PCBP1 also regulates PRL-3 at the translational level,39
all which could also be involved in PRL-3 upregulation in
FLT3-ITD–negative AML. The exact underlying mechanism will be subsequently characterized in future studies.
