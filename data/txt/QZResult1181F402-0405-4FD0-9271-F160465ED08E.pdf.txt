Abstract
High-grade serous cancer (HGSC), the most common subtype of ovarian cancer, often becomes resistant to
chemotherapy, leading to poor patient outcomes. Intratumoral heterogeneity occurs in nearly all solid cancers,
including ovarian cancer, contributing to the development of resistance mechanisms. In this study, we examined
the spatial and temporal genomic variation in HGSC using high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism
arrays. Multiple metastatic lesions from individual patients were analyzed along with 22 paired pretreatment and
posttreatment samples. We documented regions of differential DNA copy number between multiple tumor
biopsies that correlated with altered expression of genes involved in cell polarity and adhesion. In the paired
primary and relapse cohort, we observed a greater degree of genomic change in tumors from patients that were
initially sensitive to chemotherapy and had longer progression-free interval compared with tumors from patients
that were resistant to primary chemotherapy. Notably, deletion or downregulation of the lipid transporter LRP1B
emerged as a signiﬁcant correlate of acquired resistance in our analysis. Functional studies showed that reducing
LRP1B expression was sufﬁcient to reduce the sensitivity of HGSC cell lines to liposomal doxorubicin, but not to
doxorubicin, whereas LRP1B overexpression was sufﬁcient to increase sensitivity to liposomal doxorubicin.
Together, our ﬁndings underscore the large degree of variation in DNA copy number in spatially and temporally
separated tumors in HGSC patients, and they deﬁne LRP1B as a potential contributor to the emergence of
chemotherapy resistance in these patients. Cancer Res; 72(16); 4060–73. 2012 AACR.

Genomic change is a hallmark of tumor progression, associated with defects in checkpoint control and DNA repair mechanisms (1, 2). Somatic mutations arising during tumor development generate intratumoral heterogeneity, which underlie
within-patient differences in tumor morphology, growth, and
therapeutic response. The degree of intratumoral heterogeneity
is a reﬂection of mutation rate, emergence of clones with a
selection beneﬁt, and genetic drift in the population (3, 4).
Intratumoral heterogeneity has been reported in a number
of solid cancers, leukemia and lymphoma (5, 6), and has been
identiﬁed by analysis of individual genes such as TP53 and
ERBB2 (7), using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; ref. 8)
or microsatellite analysis (7) of a small number of loci. More
recently, complex DNA copy number microarrays and nextgeneration sequencing techniques have provided powerful
techniques for exploring clonal diversity, tumor evolution, and
development of treatment resistance. For example, chromosomal structural information from next-generation sequencing has been used to track dispersal of pancreatic metastases to
different organs and estimate time course of disease (9, 10).
Genomic variation has been observed between samples collected at presentation and recurrence in breast cancer (11),

acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; refs. 12, 13), and cervical
cancer (14). Analysis of individual sectors of solid tumors, ﬂow
cytometry sorting (8, 15, 16), and single-cell sequencing (17)
have identiﬁed distinct populations of tumor cells within
individual patient samples. These studies provide insight into
rates of genomic change in an evolving cancer and, importantly, help deﬁne genes associated with tumor progression
and treatment failure (18).
Ovarian cancer is a histologically diverse disease, with highgrade serous cancer (HGSC) accounting for approximately
65% of deaths. Most women with advanced HGSC are initially
responsive to treatment, but majority relapse with disease that
becomes progressively less responsive to chemotherapy (5).
HGSC show considerable DNA copy number change (19), with
high rates of genomic instability (20) and somatic TP53 mutation (21, 22). Intratumoral heterogeneity has been observed in
HGSC using microsatellite probes and SNP markers in cancerassociated genes (7). A study comparing loss of heterozygosity
patterns in primary and metastatic HGSC found a complex
rather than sequential pattern of clonal evolution (23). Selection of preexisting minor genetic subpopulations has been
associated with emergence of drug-resistant disease (5).
Several molecular events associated with emergence of
treatment resistance in ovarian cancer have recently been
identiﬁed. Intragenic BRCA1/2 mutations, resulting in partial
restoration of defective germ line alleles, have been observed in
tumors following platinum-based chemotherapy and emergence of resistance (24). Cells lines derived from pre- and posttreatment patient samples have identiﬁed HDAC-4–regulated
STAT1 activation (25) and DNA-PK mediated activation of AKT
(26) as inﬂuencing sensitivity of HGSC to platins. Whether other
mechanisms exist to inﬂuence development of treatment resistance and how intratumoral heterogeneity relates to clinical
outcome in ovarian cancer remains to be explored.
Here we examine spatial and temporal diversity in HGSC
using high-resolution SNP arrays, multiple metastatic lesions
from individual patients, and paired pre- and posttreatment
samples. We ﬁnd considerable spatial variation in DNA copy
number changes in multiple tumor biopsies, associated with
differential gene expression. In the paired primary and relapse
cohort, we observe a greater degree of genomic change in
tumors from patients that were initially responsive compared
with tumors from patients resistant to primary chemotherapy.
We identify deletion and downregulation of LRP1B associated
with acquired resistance in both a discovery and independent
validation data set. Functional in vitro studies support the
conclusion that LRP1B, a member of the lipid transporter
family, is involved in emergence of resistance to liposomal
doxorubicin in HGSC.

Patients and Methods
Patient cohorts
Human tissue use had Institutional Ethics Review Board
approval from all participating centers and informed consent
was obtained from all study participants.
Patients in this study were recruited from the Australian
Ovarian Cancer Study (www.aocstudy.org), a population-based
study, between 2002 and 2011 (27). Details of patient accrual,

collection of clinical data, pathologic review, and biospecimen
processing have been described previously (27). Details of
primary surgical and paired pretreatment and relapse cohorts
are provided in Supplementary Methods.
Genomic analysis
DNA and RNA samples were processed according to manufacture's protocol for Affymetrix SNP6.0 Mapping arrays and
Affymetrix GeneST 1.0 arrays, respectively. DNA copy number
was obtained as described previously (19). Information on
normalization and analysis is available in Supplementary
Methods. DNA copy number and gene expression data are
available at National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession numbers
GSE38787 and GSE38734, respectively.
Genomic distances between 2 tumor samples from the
same patient were determined by identifying regions of copy
number change (Log20.3 and 0.3 for gains and losses, respectively), where a contiguous genomic region was considered a
genome-altering event. The number of distinct genomic events
was considered the distance between any pair of genomes. Two
genomic regions were considered distinct if, and only if, at least
one breakpoint was greater than a threshold (100,000 bps).
Pairwise distance between samples were used to construct a
phylogenetic tree for each individual using the "neighborjoining" tree estimation (28).
Quantitative real-time PCR
Measurement of expression of coding genes was carried out
using SYBR green quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase
PCR (qRT-PCR) assay (Applied Biosystems) as previously
described (29). qRT-PCR conditions are provided in Supplementary Methods.
Cell culture, transfection, and drug sensitivity assays
IGROV1 and OVCAR4 cells were obtained from the National
Cancer Institute Repository. Kuramochi cells from Japan
Health Science Research Bank, and JHOS3 cells from Riken
BioResource Centre. Cell lines authenticated by short tandem
repeat (STR) loci proﬁling (November 2011). Culture conditions are described in Supplementary Methods.
Transfection of stable cell lines. LRP1B domain IV–containing minireceptor (mLRP1B) with HA-tag (30) was provided
by Guojun Bu (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and
transfected into IGROV1 and OVCAR4 cells. Stable transfectants were selected and maintained with 400 and 200 mg/mL
G418, respectively.
siRNA transfection. ON-Target plus individual siRNAs,
siRNA pools, and transfection reagents were obtained from
Dharmacon (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc) and transfections carried out as previously described (29) and detailed in Supplementary Methods. Cell viability was determined using CellTiter
96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) as previously described (29).
Proliferation assay. LRP1B overexpressing cells were
seeded, 1  105 cells/well in 6-well plates, and cell numbers
determined daily for 4 days by Countess (Invitrogen). Each
experiment was carried out in triplicate, at least 3 times.

be used to infer clonal relationships (10). We therefore sought
to explore the extent of DNA copy number changes between
different metastatic sites from the same patient collected at
primary surgery. Affymetrix SNP6.0 arrays were used to obtain
high-resolution estimates of DNA copy number change in
primary and multiple metastatic sites from 4 patients (Supplementary Methods). Data were normalized and segmented
(Supplementary Methods) to deﬁne discrete regions of DNA
copy number change and allow estimation of genetic heterogeneity between tumor deposits.
Although the majority of regions of DNA copy number
change was shared among different tumor deposits within
a given patient, none of the primary and metastatic tumor
genetic proﬁles was identical (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1).

Analysis of Acquired Chemoresistance in Ovarian Cancer

We used phylogenetic tree analysis to calculate the most
parsimonious relationship between tumor deposits from a
patient (Fig. 1B). The number of new genomic events between
most disparate samples within each patient and fraction of all
focal copy number changes was 117 (29%; patient 11242), 334
(63%; patient 8479), 114 (25%; patient 6496), and 93 (26%;
patient 7899), showing that even when small subsets of metastatic deposits are analyzed, substantial copy number variation is apparent.
Many regions of differential copy number change within a
patient coincide with known regions of copy number change
in HGSC (Supplementary Table S1; refs. 19, 32) and therefore
may affect oncogenic drivers allowing tumor cells to adapt to
tissue-speciﬁc requirements. To investigate further, we
obtained RNA expression proﬁles using Affymetrix Gene ST1.0
arrays of the most genomically distinct samples within a
patient (Fig. 1C). Regions of differential copy number change
between tumor deposits were associated with correspondingly
large-scale changes in gene expression (Fig. 1D; Supplementary
Fig. S1A and B).
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering resulted in primary
tumors and abdominal deposits segregating. GeneGo pathway
analysis of differentially expressed genes between primary
tumors and deposits (Fig. 1C) revealed 4 of the top 10 pathways
related to cytoskeleton remodeling and cell adhesion (Supplementary Table S2).
Genomic change between paired primary and recurrent
ovarian tumors is associated with initial treatment
response
Abdominal distention, due to accumulation of ﬂuid (ascites)
and suspended tumor cells, often develops in women with
HGSC following relapse. Paracentesis of ascites provided a
source of tumor material to explore the variation that occurs
between primary and relapse samples. We obtained paired
HGSC samples from 22 patients who had previously been
treated with platinum-based and, in many cases, other chemotherapy regimens (Table 1; Supplementary Table S3). Patients
were divided into 3 cohorts (Supplementary Methods), primary–relapse sensitive (S-S cohort, N ¼ 2, 3–5 lines of chemotherapy), primary sensitive–relapse resistant (S-R cohort, N ¼
11, 2–8 lines of chemotherapy), and primary resistant–relapse
resistant (R-R cohort, N ¼ 9, 2–6 lines of chemotherapy).
Clinical characteristics of the cohorts, including patient age,
International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage,
histopathologic grade, and extent of residual disease following
debulking surgery were well-balanced, with no statistically
signiﬁcant difference between any tested variable except for
progression-free survival (PFS; P < 0.0001, Log-rank test) and
overall survival (OS; P < 0.001, Log-rank test; Table 1).
Extensive differential DNA copy number change was
observed between paired primary and relapse ovarian tumors,
however, this seemed to be independent of time between
sample collection (Fig. 2A), suggesting that degree of change
is not simply a function of a constant rate of genomic drift. We
then divided cases based on response to initial treatment and
chemotherapy at the time of sampling. Although there was a
trend toward a greater degree of genomic change in the S-R

www.aacrjournals.org

cohort compared with R-R patient tumors, this was not
signiﬁcant (P < 0.11, Fig. 2B). Germ line BRCA1 or BRCA2
mutation has been shown to strongly inﬂuence treatment
response and OS and can confound analysis of outcomes in
sporadic ovarian cancer patients (33). When we excluded
cases in our series known to harbor pathogenic germ line
(N ¼ 4) or somatic (N ¼ 1) BRCA1 mutations (Supplementary
Table S4; ref. 34), we observed signiﬁcantly more differential
DNA copy number change between S-R versus R-R pairs (P <
0.005). This did not seem to be due to a greater exposure to
cytotoxic therapy, as we found no relationship between
number of lines of chemotherapy and extent of genomic
change (Fig. 2C).
Recurrent chromosomal aberrations at 10q25.2, Xp11.4,
and 2q21.2 are associated with acquired resistance
The availability of paired samples allowed us to explore
recurrent genomic changes speciﬁcally associated with emergence of chemotherapy resistance. We began by examining 19
known cancer oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes associated with common regions of gain or loss in HGSC, including
MYC, PAX8, and CDKN2A. In addition, we tested DNA copy
number change and gene expression of 19 literature-derived
candidate genes either identiﬁed through induction of chemotherapy resistance in vitro but have not been analyzed using
human samples or not validated with independent clinical data
sets (Supplementary Fig. S2). These genes included ANXA3 (35),
ANXA11 (36), ATP7A and ATP7B (37, 38), ERCC1 (39), and
ERCC5 (40). Candidate genes were also tested in an independent unmatched cohort of 92 primary tumor and 43 relapse
ascites samples (Table 2). We found no association between
any known oncogenes, tumor suppressors, or candidate genes
and emergence of resistance (Supplementary Fig. S3).
We then analyzed genome-wide copy number change data,
seeking regions speciﬁcally ampliﬁed or deleted in S-R versus
the R-R cohort (Supplementary Figs. S4–S5). Analysis of 11 S-R
pairs identiﬁed the fraction of new genomic events in the
recurrent samples ranged from 6% to 65% with a total of 85
discrete regions of ampliﬁcation and 125 deletions in the
recurrent samples not present in the primary tumors (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). Three regions were recurrently
present in 3 or more samples in the S-R but not R-R samples,
including copy number gain at 10q25.2 (27%, 3 of 11 samples,
containing ACSL5, GPAM, GUCY2G, HABP2, LOC143488, NRAP,
TCFL2, TECTB, VTI1A, and ZDHHC6) and loss at 2q21.2 (36%,
4 of 11, containing LRP1B) and Xp11.4 (27%, 3 of 11, containing BCOR).
We considered whether recurrently altered regions could
be a function of the different tissue types used for primary
(solid tumor) and relapse (ascites) samples. It is unlikely any
recurrent regions of copy number change seen in S-R samples reﬂected genomic alterations speciﬁcally required by
suspended ascites cells, however, as R-R samples also
involved paired solid and suspended tumor material. As a
further control, we compared copy number change in 4
tumor and ascites pairs, in which both were collected at
primary surgery. Discrete regions of copy number change
were observed between paired samples (Supplementary Fig.

however, none were associated with 10q25.2, Xp11.4, or

Loss of LRP1B gene expression is associated with
acquired treatment failure
We next sought to understand the implications of genomic
changes associated with acquired resistance, focusing on the
most common region of change, 2q21.2. Comparison of tumors
showed a minimum common region of deletion of 0.19Mb,
encompassing exons 12–22 of the low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) receptor–related protein 1B (LRP1B) gene (Fig. 3A;
Supplementary Fig. S7). Intragenic deletion of LRP1B is common in solid cancers (41), resulting in frameshift and translation of truncated, inactive protein (42–44). More recently,
missense mutations have been reported (32) and, consistent

with a role as a tumor suppressor, these do not seem to cluster
to particular regions of the protein.
qRT-PCR was carried out to measure LRP1B mRNA expression in the 22 paired samples from the discovery set (Fig. 3B).
Pair-wise comparisons of gene expression were made between
R-R and S-R pairs. Primary tumor–primary ascites were included as additional controls for differences in tissue composition.
Within the S-R cohort, a signiﬁcant reduction in LRP1B
expression was observed in relapse-resistant ascites compared
with matched primary sensitive tumors, as well as to R-R pairs
(P < 0.0001, paired t test; Fig. 3B). No signiﬁcant reduction in
expression was observed in relapse-resistant ascites compared
with matched primary resistant tumors (P ¼ 0.61, paired t
test; Fig. 3B).
An independent unpaired data set of 92 primary tumor and
43 recurrent ascites HGSC samples (Table 2) were used to

serous histology, with either low (IGROV1, OVCAR4) or high
(Kuramochi, JHOS3) LRP1B gene expression and no evidence of
copy number change involving LRP1B.
Due to the large open reading frame of LRP1B (13,797 base
pairs with 91 exons), we used a previously reported fully
functional minigene, mLRP1B4 (30). IGROV1 and OVCAR4,
which showed low LRP1B expression (Supplementary Fig. S8),

Stable transfectants were selected and mLRP1B4 expression
conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4A). Consistent with previous
reports (45), cells expressing mLRP1B4 grew signiﬁcantly
slower than parental and vector control in both the IGROV1
cells (P < 0.005, Fig. 4B) and OVCAR4 cells (P < 0.0005, data not

Ectopic expression of LRP1B increases drug sensitivity to
liposomal doxorubicin but not doxorubicin
Acquired drug resistance has variously been attributed to
enhanced DNA repair, decreased drug inﬂux, increased drug
efﬂux, reduced drug activation, enhanced drug inactivation,
changes in drug–target interaction, inhibition of apoptosis, and
enhanced EGFR MAPK/ERK signaling (46, 47). As a member of
the LDL receptor family, LRP1B has been suggested to play a
role in endocytosis of certain drugs (48), including liposomally
modiﬁed agents, such as liposomal doxorubicin (CAELYX).
Given the proposed role of LRP1B in drug endocytosis and
association of LRP1B deletion with acquisition of resistance,

we examined the effect of ectopic expression of LRP1B on drug
sensitivity. We carried out a dose–response analysis to characterize the effect of doxorubicin and liposomal doxorubicin
following transfection in IGROV1 and OVCAR4 cells (Fig. 4C–
H). No difference in dose response or IC50 was observed
between IGROV1 (Fig. 4C and G) or OVCAR4 (Fig. 4E and
G) parental, pcDNA3 vector alone, and mLRP1B4-transfected
cells following treatment with doxorubicin. However, a statistically signiﬁcant shift in the dose–response curve was
observed in IGROV1 and OVCAR-4 pcDNA3-HA-mLRP1B4–

Discussion
Our work provides the most extensive high-resolution analysis to date of genomic variation in spatially and temporally
separated tumor deposits recovered from individual patients
with HGSC. Consistent with a previous report using microsatellite markers (23), we found considerable genomic difference
between individual abdominal deposits within a patient. It is
perhaps not surprising that substantial copy number differences can be found between metastatic deposits, given the high
degree of DNA copy number change that commonly occurs in
HGSC (19, 32, 49). Whether the variants observed were preexisting in the primary tumor or represent de novo genomic
change arising after dissemination can be addressed by generating precise breakpoint information using next-generation
DNA sequencing and highly sensitive PCR assays (12).
HGSC tumor cells disseminate rapidly through the abdomen
from the ovary or fallopian tube, as the surface of these tissues
are contiguous with the peritoneal space. Although shedding is
unlikely to present the same biologic obstacle to spread as
invasion through tissue planes, the genomic change we
observed might partially reﬂect selection for speciﬁc growth
requirements within the peritoneum. For example, it has been
recently shown that adipocytes modulate growth of HGSC and
seem to promote establishment on the omentum (50). The
hypoxic environment of the peritoneal space may create
additional selective pressures. DNA copy number is an important determinant of gene expression in HGSC (51) and consistent with this, we see global effects on gene expression
associated with regions of copy number change. Analysis of
regions of differential copy number change and gene expression revealed signaling pathways plausibly linked to peritoneal
dissemination and establishment of metastatic foci. Additional
samples are needed to determine whether the variation we see
in deposits reﬂects selection of driver or passenger events.
We used paired samples, collected pre- and posttreatment,
to investigate genomic change over time and in response to
chemotherapy, contrasting patients who were initially responsive with those with a short PFS. Paired material is a powerful
means of identifying genes that may confer resistance in
HGSC, especially given the difﬁculty of discerning driver
events among the high degree of genomic change already
present in primary samples. Previously, a small set of cell lines,
derived from pre- and posttreatment tumors assisted in
identiﬁcation of HDAC4/STAT1 (25) and DNA-PK/AKT activation (26) as mechanisms associated with emergence of
platinum resistance. Analysis of relapse samples has also
shown that reversion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germ line mutations following therapy seems to be a common mechanism
associated with reduced platinum sensitivity (24) in BRCA
mutation carriers.

4070

Cancer Res; 72(16) August 15, 2012

Cooke and colleagues (5) found few DNA copy number
changes between paired pre- and postneoadjuvant treatment
(3 cycles) samples, whereas we found substantial genomic
change between tumor material collected pretreatment and
that obtained months to years later. We observed signiﬁcantly
greater genomic change in sensitive–relapse pairs than in
patients who were resistant from the outset, possibly reﬂecting
the requirement for selection of a subpopulation of resistant
cells in initially sensitive cases. Less genomic copy number
change was observed in BRCA1 mutation–positive cases, perhaps because small intragenic deletions can be sufﬁcient for
emergence of resistant clones (24). Our studies made use of
relapse ascites, with tumor cells isolated using anti-EpCAM–
coated magnetic beads. Although most tumor cells are likely to
express the EpCAM marker, we are aware that other cell
populations, particularly a stem cell population, could be lost
during puriﬁcation and subsequent analyses. However, copy
number events occurring in tumor-initiating cells should be
propagated during differentiation. We also considered whether
our analysis would be confounded by copy number events
required for prevention of anoikis in tumor cells suspended in
ascites ﬂuid and controlled for this possibility by use of R-R and
primary tumor/primary ascites cohorts. Our studies involved
women who developed malignant ascites and thus may represent a subset of all patients with HGSC. Ascites is common at
presentation in ovarian cancer and especially so in progressive
disease (52); therefore, our analysis is likely to be broadly
applicable to HGSC patients.
The most frequent genomic change we observed in S-R pairs
was at 2q21.2, with recurrent deletion focused at LRP1B.
Although the number of samples was small, several lines of
evidence favor LRP1B as the driver of the 2q21.2 event, including interstitial deletions in some cases, loss of RNA expression,
and functional data that were consistent with patient data.
LRP1B is a member of the LDL receptor family and is among the
top 10 genes mutated in human cancer (41). Its large size and
location near the FRA2F fragile site (53) may contribute to a
high mutation rate as a passenger event; however, several
observations favor LRP1B being a bona ﬁde driver mutation
in human cancer, including a very high frequency of homozygous deletions (54), frequent point mutation in lung cancer (55,
56) and melanoma (57), and promoter methylation in esophageal (58), oral (59), thyroid (60), and gastric cancer (45).
Although located adjacent to a fragile site, FRA2F is the least
sensitive fragile site in the aphidicolin fragility assay and scored
highest in a computational measure for homozygous deletion
selection pressure (54). In vitro data also supports a role for
LRP1B as a tumor suppressor with LRP1B interacting with
uPAR to inhibit cell migration (61). Overexpression of LRP1B
inhibits cell growth and colony formation in vitro and tumor
formation in nude mice (45).
A mouse mammary tumor model of Trp53/Brca1 mutation
was found to have internal deletion of Lrp1b at exons 4–11 (62).
In this study, we identiﬁed internal deletions of LRP1B with a
minimal amplicon boundary targeting a region of 0.19Mb,
encompassing exons 12–22. Similar to our ﬁndings, an analysis
of a panel of human cancer cell lines revealed an internal
homozygous deletion rate of 4.2%, some of which generated

in-frame fusions and others that resulted in truncated protein
(62). Copy number analysis of our cases suggests a heterozygous loss; however, analysis of gene expression shows a very
substantial reduction in all cases and in some, almost complete loss of LRP1B expression. Importantly, we validated
expression loss in resistant samples from patients who were
initially responsive to treatment using an independent data
set. Furthermore, LRP1B loss does not seem to be a general
feature of ascites, as it was not identiﬁed in R-R and primary
tumor/primary ascites cohorts. Gain and loss of function
experiments in vitro were consistent with in vivo data, with
the effect speciﬁc to liposomal doxorubicin treatment. In
these studies, doxorubicin acts as a valuable control, especially
given the effect that alteration of LRP1B expression has on cell
growth and division.
LRP1B binds to ﬁbrinogen and apoE-containing ligands (63)
and importantly, several studies have suggested that LDL
receptor family members are involved in uptake of anionic
liposomes and drugs (48, 64). Primary chemotherapy treatment was predominantly a combination of carboplatin/paclitaxel while relapse patients were exposed to a variety of
agents, one of the most common being liposomal doxorubicin.
Of note, all patients with LRP1B deletion in our series received
liposomal doxorubicin treatment, with no clinical response
observed. We propose that against a background of high
mutation frequency, cells with LRP1B loss may be readily
selected for during liposomal doxorubicin treatment, providing an additional opportunistic advantage to the tumor. As
such, testing for LRP1B loss in the clinical setting may be a
useful predictor of response to liposomal doxorubicin,
although the assay would need to be sensitive enough to detect
rare existing clones that could rapidly contribute to the emergence of resistance. The large size of the LRP1B gene will add
additional challenges to mutation scanning. An investigation
of a possible role of LRP1B in resistance to other chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in late-stage ovarian cancer
treatment is warranted.
To date most studies investigating acquired chemoresistance in ovarian cancer have been undertaken in vitro, with few
studies validated in patient material. However, a number of
mechanisms of resistance have been identiﬁed recently using
samples from women with recurrent disease, including
HDAC4/STAT1 activation (25), DNA-PK/AKT activation (26),
and BRCA1/2 germ line mutation reversion (24). Due to high
degree of intratumoral heterogeneity and the large number of

chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in the relapse setting in HGSC patients, it is likely that there will be multiple
mechanisms of acquired resistance. Our data indicates that
LRP1B loss contributes to the emergence of resistance to
chemotherapy, speciﬁcally to liposomal doxorubicin.
