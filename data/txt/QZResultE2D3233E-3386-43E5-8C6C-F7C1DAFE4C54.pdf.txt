Abstract
Fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme responsible for the
de novo synthesis of fatty acids, is highly expressed in ovarian
cancers and most common human carcinomas. Inhibition of
FAS and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
have been shown to be cytotoxic to human cancer cells in vitro
and in vivo. In this report, we explore the cytotoxic mechanism
of action of FAS inhibition and show that C93, a synthetic FAS
inhibitor, increases the AMP/ATP ratio, activating AMPK in
SKOV3 human ovarian cancer cells, which leads to cytotoxicity.
As a physiologic consequence of AMPK activation, acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (ACC), the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid
synthesis, was phosphorylated and inhibited whereas glucose
oxidation was increased. Despite these attempts to conserve
energy, the AMP/ATP ratio increased with worsening cellular
redox status. Pretreatment of SKOV3 cells with compound C,
an AMPK inhibitor, substantially rescued the cells from C93
cytotoxicity, indicating its dependence on AMPK activation.
5-(Tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid, an ACC inhibitor, did not
activate AMPK despite inhibiting fatty acid synthesis pathway
activity and was not significantly cytotoxic to SKOV3 cells.
This indicates that substrate accumulation from FAS inhibition
triggering AMPK activation, not end-product depletion of fatty
acids, is likely responsible for AMPK activation. C93 also
exhibited significant antitumor activity and apoptosis against
SKOV3 xenografts in athymic mice without significant weight
loss or cytotoxicity to proliferating cellular compartments
such as bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, or skin. Thus,
pharmacologic FAS inhibition selectively activates AMPK in
ovarian cancer cells, inducing cytotoxicity while sparing most
normal human tissues from the pleiotropic effects of AMPK
activation. [Cancer Res 2007;67(7):2964–71]

cancers (2). Fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme responsible for
the de novo synthesis of fatty acids, has emerged as a potential
therapeutic target for human cancer. FAS catalyzes the condensation of malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA to produce long-chain fatty
acids (3). High levels of FAS expression have been found in ovarian
cancer (4, 5) and in most human solid tumors (6). The up-regulation
of FAS expression in cancer cells has been linked to both mitogenactivated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways through the sterol regulatory binding element binding protein
1c (7–9). FAS protein expression denotes poor prognosis in breast
and prostate cancer (10–15) and is found elevated in the blood of
cancer patients (16, 17). Inhibition of FAS activity is selectively
cytotoxic to human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (13, 18–21)
including human ovarian cancer xenografts (20, 22).
The mechanism linking inhibition of FAS activity to cancer cell
death remains an active area of investigation. Because endogenously synthesized fatty acids in cancer cells are incorporated
predominantly into phospholipids (23), it was hypothesized that
FAS inhibition reduced available fatty acids for structural lipid
synthesis in these cells. However, FAS inhibition induced apoptosis
whereas pharmacologic inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase
(ACC), the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid synthesis, was far
less toxic and actually protected cancer cells from FAS inhibition
(18, 24). These findings implicated the accumulation of FAS
substrates such as malonyl-CoA, rather than the depletion of endproduct fatty acids, as contributing to cancer cell death. In addition
to fatty acid synthesis, a number of other pathways have been
found to modulate cytotoxicity following FAS inhibition including
p53 (25, 26), HER2/neu (27, 28), and Akt (20, 29). Whereas these
pathways may alter the response of cancer cells to FAS inhibition,
the link between FAS enzyme inhibition and cancer cell death
remains elusive.
C75, a synthetic mammalian FAS inhibitor (30), provided much
of the in vivo evidence of the selective antitumor activity of
pharmacologic FAS inhibition (13, 18, 19). Treatment, however, was
limited by anorexia and weight loss (18, 31). While investigating the
mechanism of action of C75-induced weight loss, we discovered
that, in addition to FAS inhibition, C75 also stimulated carnitine
palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) activity, leading to substantially
increased fatty acid oxidation (32–35). CPT-1 is the rate-limiting
transporter of long-chain acyl-CoAs into the mitochondria for
oxidation. These studies raised the possibility that increased fatty
acid oxidation could be responsible for at least part of the
anticancer effect of C75. However, in vitro studies of fatty acid
oxidation (24) and short interfering FAS RNA treatment of cancer
cells (21) have established that FAS is the target of C75-induced
cytotoxicity in cancer.
Although FAS seems to be the target of C75 for cancer
cytotoxicity, the mechanism involved in the induction of anorexia

FAS Inhibition and AMPK Activation

involves the increase of fatty acid oxidation through CPT-1
stimulation, as well as the reduction of hypothalamic neuropeptide-Y expression (31). Further studies showed a pivotal role for
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the mechanism of C75induced anorexia (36, 37). AMPK is activated in cells as a response
to metabolic stresses that lead to the depletion of cellular ATP
levels and thus the increase in AMP/ATP ratio (38, 39). The
involvement of AMPK in the hypothalamic response to C75 (37) led
to the hypothesis that the antitumor effect of FAS inhibition could
also be mediated through changes in AMPK activation.
Thus, we and our collaborators sought to synthesize smallmolecule FAS inhibitors that retain antitumor activity without
inducing weight loss or stimulating fatty acid oxidation, which led
to the development of C93 (40). In this study, we used human
SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells to explore the role of AMPK in the
cytotoxic mechanism of action of FAS inhibition using C93.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, chemicals, and antibodies. SKOV3 human ovarian cancer
cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA),
were cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. C93 and compound C were obtained from FASgen, Inc.
(Baltimore. MD). 5-(Tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA) was synthesized by
C.A. Townsend (Department of Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University,
Baltimore, MD). C93, compound C, and TOFA were added to the cultures
from 5 mg/mL stock solutions in 100% DMSO to give the indicated
concentrations and the final DMSO concentration in cultures was V0.2%.
Antibodies to pACC, pAMPK, AMPK, and h-actin were obtained from Cell
Signaling (Danvers, MA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to human FAS were
obtained courtesy of FASgen.
To generate AMPK isoform–specific antibodies, rabbits were immunized
with a peptide corresponding to amino acids 339 to 358 (DFYLATSPPDSFLDDHHLTR) of rat AMPKa1 or amino acids 352 to 366
(MDDSAMHIPPGLKPH) of a2 (41, 42). The keyhole limpet hemocyanin/
GGG–conjugated peptides were injected to produce antibodies. The
peptide-specific affinity-purified antibodies were used for SAMS peptide
AMPK activity assay.
Cell viability assay. To measure the cytotoxicity of specific compounds
against cancer cells, 9  103 SKOV3 cells were plated per well onto 96-well
plates. Following overnight culture, the compounds, dissolved in 100%
DMSO, were added to the wells in 1-AL volume at specified concentrations.
Vehicle controls were run for each experiment. Each condition was run in
triplicate.
After 24 or 72 h of incubation, cells were incubated for 4 h with the 2,3bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner
salt (XTT) reagent as per manufacturer’s instructions (Cell Proliferation Kit
II, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Plates were read at A 490 and A 650 on
a SpectraMax Plus Spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).
Three wells containing the XTT reagent without cells served as the plate
blank. XTT data were reported as A 490
A 650. Averages and SEs were
computed using SOFTmax Pro software (Molecular Devices). The LC50 for
each compound was defined as the concentration of drug leading to a 50%
reduction in A 490
A 650 compared with controls. LC50 was calculated by
linear regression, plotting the FAS activity as percent of control versus drug
concentrations. Linear regression, best-fit line, r 2, and 95% confidence
intervals were determined using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA).
Purification and assay of rat FAS. Frozen livers from rats induced for
FAS production were obtained from Pel-Freeze Biologicals (Rogers, AR).
Purification of FAS was adopted from Smith and Abraham (43) with minor
modifications. An analogous protocol was used to isolate the human
enzyme from a cultured ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell line provided by FASgen.
The specific activity and steady-state kinetic constants for overall FAS
activity were similar to those reported in the literature for the rat (44) and

human (45) enzyme. Overall FAS activity was monitored spectrophotometrically by following the oxidation of NADPH at 240 nm [e = 6,220 (mol/L) 1
cm 1] in the presence of the physiologic substrates malonyl-CoA and acetylCoA, as previously reported (43). Inhibition was monitored by varying
concentrations of test compound in the overall FAS assay and IC50 values
were determined by regression analysis (sigmoidal dose response) of the
inhibition data (SigmaPlot, Point Richmond, CA).
Fatty acid synthesis. Fatty acid synthesis was measured by incorporation of [U-14C]acetate into lipids as described (18). Briefly, SKOV3 cells were
cultured in 24-well plates at 5  104 per well and incubated overnight. After
the addition of drugs or vehicle alone as indicated, cells were pulse labeled
with [U-14C]acetate, 1 ACi/well for 30 min to 2 h. Each condition was run in
triplicate. Lipids were Folch extracted, counted for 14C, and data were
expressed as percent of control.
Fatty acid oxidation. Fatty acid oxidation was measured by isolation of
acid soluble products as described (46). Briefly, 2.5  105 cells were plated
onto 24-well plates. Following overnight culture, cells were incubated with
drug for 60 min at 37jC for specified doses. The medium was removed
and 250 AL of reaction buffer [100 Amol/L [U-14C]palmitate (1.42 ACi),
200 Amol/L carnitine in serum-free medium with appropriate concentration
of drug] were added for 30 min. The reaction was stopped with 50 AL of
2.6 N HClO4 and neutralized with 50 AL of 4 N KOH. Cells were incubated at
60jC for 30 min and 75 AL of 1 mol/L sodium acetate and 50 AL of 3 N
H2SO4 were added. Cells were centrifuged at 1,000  g for 7 min and
extracted with 1:1 chloroform/methanol. The aqueous phase was counted
for 14C. Each condition was run in triplicate; data were expressed as percent
of control.
Glucose oxidation. Glucose oxidation was measured in SKOV3 cells as
described (47). Briefly, 106 adherent SKOV3 cells were treated with C93 in
Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer containing 1% bovine serum
albumin and 5 mmol/L glucose (47) at concentrations and times indicated.
For the final 30 min of each treatment, 0.5 ACi/mL [U-14C]glucose was
added. Reactions were stopped with 7% HClO4, and 400 AL of benzethonium
hydroxide were injected in the center well. After 2 h at 37jC, complete
oxidation was quantified by measuring the amount of 14C in the center well
by liquid scintillation counting. Each condition was run in triplicate; data
were expressed as percent of control.
Western blot analysis. Cells were homogenized in lysis buffer consisting
of 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mmol/L sucrose, 5 mmol/L sodium
pyrophosphate, 50 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L
DTT, 0.5 mmol/L benzamidine, 50 Ag/mL leupeptin, and 50 Ag/mL soybean
trypsin inhibitor. SDS was added to a concentration of 0.2% and proteins
were separated on 4% to 15% polyacrylamide gradient gels and transferred to
a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane. Blots were probed with anti-pAMPK,
anti-AMPK, anti-FAS, or anti–h-actin. Samples for pACC immunoblots
were run on separate 5% polyacrylamide gels.
Measurement of adenine and pyridine nucleotides. Both adenine and
pyridine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP, NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH)
were measured concomitantly using high-performance liquid chromatography as described (48). Briefly, 1  106 SKOV3 cells were plated onto
60-mm dishes and treated as described. Pyridine and adenine nucleotides
were extracted with alkali before high-performance liquid chromatography
analysis. Cell extracts and purified nucleotide controls (Sigma) were
separated and quantified using an Agilent 1100 running ChemStation
software as follows: 50 AL of the supernatants were loaded onto an LC-18
column and absorbance at 254 nm was measured. The two eluants were
buffer A: 0.1 mol/L KH2PO4, 8 mmol/L tetrabutylammonium hydrogen
sulfate, pH 6.0; and buffer B: 70% buffer A in methanol. The following
gradients were carried out: 0 to 2.5 min, 100% A; 2.5 to 5.0 min, 80% A; 5.0 to
10.0 min, 60% A: 10.0 to 13.0 min, 0% A (100% B), for 5 min. The flow rate
was 1.5 mL/min. Data were expressed as ratios of redox couples or as
absorbance at 254 nm.
Measurement of AMPK activity. AMPK activity was measured by
carrying out the SAMS peptide assay as described (36, 49). SKOV3 cells were
plated onto six-well dishes and three wells were used per condition.
AMPKa1 or AMPKa2 isoforms were immunoprecipitated in the presence of
isoform-specific antibodies coupled to protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz

Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitates were washed and
kinase activity was assessed by incorporation of 32P into the synthetic SAMS
peptide substrate (Princeton Biomolecules, Langhorne, PA). Each sample
was corrected for protein concentration and triplicate assays were reported
as percent of control.
Animal studies. All animal experiments were done in accordance with
guidelines on animal care and use established by the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Female athymic nude BALB/c mice (8–10 weeks) were purchased from
Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN) and housed in a pathogen-free
facility. Animals were treated once or twice daily with i.p. injections of C93,
with 50 mg/kg dissolved in 50 AL of 100% DMSO, or with vehicle alone as
specified. For i.p. xenografts, 5  107 SKOV3 cells were injected. After seven
days, C93 was administered i.p. at 50 mg/kg daily in DMSO every fifth day for
4 weeks. Wet tumor weight was obtained at necropsy. For flank xenografts,
2  106 SKOV3 cells were injected and treatment commenced when tumors
reached 100 mm3. C93 was administered i.p. at 50 mg/kg twice a day in 100%
DMSO on each day except days 6 and 13. Tumor volume and animal weights
were measured daily.

Results
C93 inhibits FAS and is cytotoxic to SKOV3 cells but does
not increase fatty acid oxidation or induce weight loss. C93
emerged from a screen of potential inhibitors assayed against
homogenous FAS isolated from rat liver and ZR-75-1 human breast
cancer cells. The development of C93 accomplished the pharmacologic elimination of CPT-1 stimulation while preserving FAS
inhibition. Thus, C93 does not substantially affect weight loss or
feeding behavior as seen with C75 (40, 50). Highlighted in Table 1
are key features of C93 compared with C75 and TOFA, an inhibitor
of ACC (51). Both C93 and C75 inhibit FAS, but C93 is 2-fold more
effective in pathway inhibition and >3-fold more toxic to SKOV3
cells. Importantly, C93 does not stimulate CPT-1 or increase fatty
acid oxidation as does C75. As a result, C93 induced a 1.4% weight
loss in lean BALB/c mice with a single i.p. 60 mg/kg dose,
compared with a 15% weight loss with a single i.p. 30 mg/kg dose of
C75. Similar to our previous report (18), ACC inhibition with TOFA
was less cytotoxic than FAS inhibition. TOFA, although >25-fold
more effective in pathway inhibition than C93 in SKOV3 cells, was
16-fold less effective as a cytotoxic agent against SKOV3 cells
compared with C93. Thus, inhibition of the fatty acid synthesis
pathway by FAS is substantially more efficacious compared with
inhibition by the physiologic rate-limiting enzyme ACC.
C93 rapidly inhibits fatty acid synthesis and activates AMPK.
To establish the time course of events following C93 treatment of
SKOV3 cells, we first determined how rapidly C93 inhibited fatty
acid synthesis by measuring the incorporation of [14C]acetate into

lipids (Fig. 1A). Initially, C93 inhibited fatty acid synthesis pathway
activity by f60% relative to vehicle control by 30 min
posttreatment. By 160 min posttreatment, fatty acid synthesis
activity decreased to 40% of the control. We next measured ATP
and AMP levels to assess cellular energy status over the same time
course. Using the same concentrations of C93 and culture
conditions, a significant elevation in the AMP/ATP ratio occurred
within 30 min of C93 treatment (Fig. 1B). The AMP/ATP ratio
continued to increase to >2-fold compared with control at 180 min
posttreatment. Concomitant with the increase in the AMP/ATP
ratio, C93 treatment enhanced AMPK phosphorylation detected
by immunoblot within 30 min of treatment persisting through
180 min (Fig. 1C). AMPK phosphorylation was accompanied by
phosphorylation of one of its target proteins, ACC, detected 120
min posttreatment. The activation of AMPK has been shown to
phosphorylate and inhibit ACC, thus reducing fatty acid synthesis
pathway activity, thereby preserving ATP (52). Thus, ACC
phosphorylation may be responsible for the continued reduction
in FAS pathway activity at 160 min post C93 treatment seen in Fig.
1A. Recently, AMPK activation has been reported to reduce FAS
expression (53). Whereas changes in FAS expression would be
unlikely to account for the rapid reduction in pathway activity,
nonetheless, an immunoblot showed no change in FAS protein
expression compared with the h-actin control during the course of
C93 treatment (Fig. 1C).
Increased AMPK phosphorylation denotes increased AMPK
activity. To confirm the biological significance of the AMPK
phosphorylation and directly measure AMPK activity, SAMS
peptide activity assays were done (Fig. 1D ). In the inset,
immunoblots of SKOV3 cells showed predominance of the a2
isoform over the a1 isoform. Using antibodies selective for the a2
isoform, an f150% increase in AMPK activity was noted at 30 min
following C93 treatment, which continued to increase to >200% of
control by 120 min posttreatment. Taken together, these data
strongly suggest that C93 treatment rapidly activates AMPK in
SKOV3 cells.
C93 increases glucose oxidation while reducing both NAD+/
NADH and NADP+/NADPH ratios. Whereas AMPK activation
reduces the activity of anabolic pathways to preserve energy
expenditure, it concomitantly increases the activity of catabolic
pathways in an attempt to replenish ATP levels. Figure 2A shows
that following C93 treatment, SKOV3 cells significantly increased
glucose oxidation compared with controls within 60 min of
treatment. However, despite the increased glucose oxidation noted
at 60 min posttreatment, the AMP/ATP ratio did not improve
(Fig. 1B). In addition to the increasing AMP/ATP ratio, Fig. 2B

FAS Inhibition and AMPK Activation

Figure 1. C93 inhibits fatty acid synthesis
and increases the AMP/ATP ratio,
activating AMPK in SKOV3 cells. A, C93
inhibited fatty acid synthesis within 30 min
of treatment with further inhibition occurring
160 min posttreatment (two-tailed t tests).
B, the AMP/ATP ratio increased within
30 min following C93 treatment
(P < 0.0001). The overall P value was
calculated by one-way ANOVA analysis;
P values for all individual time points were
calculated with time 0 as the control value
using Dunnett’s posttest. C, immunoblot
showing AMPK and ACC phosphorylation
30 and 120 min following C93, respectively.
There was no change in FAS expression.
D, following C93 treatment, AMPK activity,
as measured by SAMS peptide assay,
increased as compared with vehicle
control (two-tailed t tests). AMPK activity
paralleled AMPK phosphorylation as
shown in (C ). Immunoblots showed that
SKOV3 cells predominantly express the
a2 AMPK isoform (insets ; *, P < 0.05;

shows that following C93 treatment, the NAD+/NADH ratio
declined, indicating a failure of the cell to maintain a positive
redox balance.
FAS uses the reductive power of NADPH in the synthesis of fatty
acids with the oxidation of 14 mol of NADPH per mole of fatty
acid synthesized. Thus, inhibition of FAS might be expected to
increase, at least transiently, NADPH levels. Figure 2C shows
that NADPH levels indeed increased within 5 min following C93
treatment without a substantial change in the NADPH/NADP+
ratio (Fig. 2D). After 60 min, however, the NADPH/NADP+ ratio
begins to decline, which may reflect the overall waning in reductive
biosynthesis activity that follows AMPK activation (52).
Compound C rescues C93-induced cytotoxicity. If AMPK
activation contributes to C93 cytotoxicity, blocking AMPK
activation with compound C, an AMPK inhibitor (37, 54), should
blunt the cytotoxic effect of C93 treatment. Figure 3A represents
three separate experiments in which SKOV3 cells were treated with
C93 alone, C93 combined with a 1-hour pretreatment with
compound C, or compound C alone. Compound C pretreatment
substantially reduced the cytotoxicity of C93 assayed 24 h posttreatment. Treatment with compound C alone at the same
concentration had no significant cytotoxic effect on SKOV3 cells.
These data suggest that AMPK activation plays a substantial role
in the cytotoxic mechanism of action of C93.
TOFA does not activate AMPK and is not toxic to SKOV3
cells at a concentration that substantially inhibits fatty acid
synthesis. Because ACC inhibition has been shown to be less
cytotoxic to human cancer cells than inhibition of fatty acid
synthesis at FAS (18), we hypothesized that TOFA treatment would
not increase AMPK phosphorylation. In Fig. 3B, TOFA treatment at
5 Ag/mL, a concentration that dramatically reduced fatty acid
synthesis (Table 1), did not substantially affect AMPK phosphor-

ylation. In contrast, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-h-Dribofuranoside (AICAR), an activator of AMPK, caused substantial
AMPK phosphorylation in SKOV3 cells at 1 mmol/L (Fig. 3B,
lane A).
Because TOFA does not activate AMPK, we next compared TOFA
with C93 and AICAR in a cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 3C). After 24 h,
C93 reduced the viability of SKOV3 cells to 75% of vehicle control,
whereas TOFA, at a concentration that substantially inhibits fatty
acid synthesis pathway activity, did not significantly affect cell
viability. AICAR, an activator of AMPK, was also substantially
cytotoxic. Thus, C93 and AICAR, which both activate AMPK, were
cytotoxic to SKOV3 cells, whereas TOFA was not. These data
further substantiate that (a) AMPK activation is cytotoxic to
human cancer cells (55); (b) inhibition of ACC with TOFA does not
lead to increased AMPK phosphorylation, consistent with previous
experiments using cultured neurons (36); and (c) inhibition of fatty
acid synthesis does not activate AMPK.
C93 inhibits the growth of the SKOV3 xenograft. Whereas
C93 is effective as a cytotoxic agent against SKOV3 cells in vitro, we
did a pilot studies of C93 to asses the antitumor activity of C93
in SKOV3 xenograft–bearing mice. In the SKOV3 i.p. xenograft
model (ref. 20; Fig. 4A), the five informative C93-treated animals
had an average tumor volume of f14 g compared with 110 g for
the vehicle controls. Three of the treated animals had no identifiable residual tumor. No significant weight loss was identified.
There were peritoneal adhesions in the C93-treated animals
bearing i.p. xenografts. In this group, three animals were lost due
to gastrointestinal trauma during i.p. injections.
Figure 4B illustrates the antitumor effect of C93 on a s.c. xenograft
of SKOV3 cells in athymic mice. C93 inhibited tumor growth 3-fold
compared with vehicle controls (P < 0.0001, repeated measures twoway ANOVA analysis; GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows). At

the conclusion of the study, the control animals weighed 97.5 F 1.2%
of pretreatment weight compared with 95.0% F 2.5% for the C93treated animals (not significant; P > 0.050, two-tailed t test). Thus,
nonoptimized treatment of the SKOV3 xenograft with C93 produced
a significant antitumor response without significant weight loss.
Histopathologic analysis of C93 SKOV3 xenografts showed extensive
tumor cytotoxicity characterized by acute inflammation (Fig. 4C,
arrows) compared with vehicle control (Fig. 4D). Necropsy of
the animals at the conclusion of both studies showed no gross or
microscopic evidence of cytotoxicity to proliferating cell compartments including skin, gastrointestinal tract, or bone marrow (data
not shown).

Discussion
With the extensive array of human cancers that express high
levels of FAS and the numerous studies documenting the cytotoxic
effects of FAS inhibition both in vitro and in vivo (6), FAS holds
promise as a new drug target for cancer therapy. Whereas our
initial studies with C75, a synthetic FAS inhibitor (30), showed
significant antitumor activity against human xenografts, treatment
was limited by dramatic weight loss (18, 31, 56). We and our
collaborators sought to understand the mechanism responsible for
C75-induced weight loss to determine if it was (a) common to all
FAS inhibitors, (b) unique to C75, (c) due to action at a second drug
target, or (d) the result of nonspecific sickness behavior. It now
seems that C75-induced weight loss occurred predominantly from
increased fatty acid oxidation via stimulation of CPT-1, rather than
solely through FAS inhibition (57). The pharmacologic separation

of CPT-1 stimulation from FAS inhibition led to the development of
C93, which affords substantial anticancer cytotoxicity in vitro and
in vivo without the weight loss seen with C75 treatment.
C93 also allowed the further pursuit of the cytotoxic mechanism
of action of FAS inhibition. The involvement of AMPK in the
hypothalamic response to C75 (37) and studies linking AMPK
activation to cell cycle arrest in transformed cells (55) led us to
hypothesize that AMPK may be involved in the cytotoxic response
of FAS inhibition. AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of
catalytic subunit a1 or a2 and regulatory h and g subunits, which
function as a serine/threonine kinase (58). Once activated by
phosphorylation, AMPK inactivates anabolic biosynthetic enzymes
for cholesterol synthesis, such as hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA
reductase, and for fatty synthesis, such as ACC, curbing ATP
utilization (38, 52). Concomitantly, AMPK stimulates catabolic
processes that enhance ATP production such as glucose uptake,
glycolysis, and fatty acid oxidation (59–62).
AMPK itself has been proposed as a therapeutic target for cancer
(55, 63, 64). AMPK activation has been shown to induce cell cycle
arrest in transformed cell lines such as HepG2 (55, 65) and in
nontransformed vascular smooth muscle cells (66). In a recent
study, AICAR treatment reduced cell proliferation in a number of
cancer cell lines in vitro including C6 rat transformed glioma,
MCF-7 human breast, and PC3 human prostate (55). AICAR
produced an S-phase arrest likely mediated by p21, p27, and p53
proteins and inhibition of Akt activation. In vivo treatment of C6
glioma cells in rats with AICAR reduced tumor mass and cell
proliferation. Importantly, AICAR inhibited proliferation of LKB /
mouse embryo fibroblasts showing independence of the LKB

cancer suppressor gene (55). Whereas these studies indicate a link
between cancer cell growth and the status of AMPK activation,
nonselective activation of AMPK in the whole organism may not
be suitable for therapy due to the pleiotropic effects of AMPK
activation (67).
FAS inhibition was first linked to AMPK activation through
studies with C75 in neurons and the central nervous system
(36, 37). In primary cultures of cortical neurons, C75 and cerulenin,
a natural product FAS inhibitor (68), initially activated AMPK
within minutes followed by inactivation over hours with no
evidence of cellular injury. In addition, ACC inhibition with TOFA
failed to show a change in AMPK activation (36). In the
hypothalamus, C75 rapidly inactivated AMPK, leading to anorexia.
AICAR reversed the effect of AMPK whereas compound C, an
AMPK inhibitor, mimicked the effect of C75 (37). Thus, feeding
behavior, FAS activity, and AMPK activation were involved in the
hypothalamic control of food intake. Because C75 was shown to
inhibit the growth of human cancer cells, we hypothesized that
AMPK may also be involved in the cytotoxic effect of FAS inhibition
on cancer cells (13, 18–21).
The increased NADPH levels following C93 treatment suggests
that significant inhibition of FAS occurs within minutes of

Figure 3. Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, rescued SKOV3 cells from C93
cytotoxicity; TOFA, an ACC inhibitor, did not activate AMPK. A, SKOV3 cells
pretreated with compound C were not susceptible to C93-induced cytotoxicity.
B, immunoblot showed that treatment of SKOV3 cells with TOFA did not
activate AMPK. C, both C93 and AICAR, AMPK activators, were significantly
cytotoxic whereas TOFA failed to induce significant cytotoxicity compared
with vehicle-treated controls (two-tailed t tests: *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01;
***, P < 0.001; Prism 4.0, GraphPad Software).

treatment. We detected significant inhibition of the fatty acid
synthesis pathway within 30 min of C93 treatment with the lag
time likely due to the limitations of [14C]acetate metabolic labeling
of lipids. FAS inhibition was followed by a significant reduction in
the AMP/ATP ratio also within 30 min of treatment. If an increase
in the AMP/ATP ratio is biologically significant enough to signal an
energy poor state, it should also activate AMPK through
phosphorylation. Both by immunoblot and SAMS peptide assay,
AMPK was activated within 30 min following C93 treatment. Thus,
C93 rapidly inhibited FAS and induced an energy-poor state in the
cancer cells with activated AMPK.
If the downstream signal transduction pathways are intact in
SKOV3 cells, AMPK activation should reduce anabolic pathways
and enhance catabolism. Two hours after C93 treatment, ACC was
phosphorylated and fatty acid synthesis was further reduced, likely
representing inhibition of ACC activity due to its phosphorylation.
Within 60 min posttreatment, glucose oxidation was significantly
increased. Thus, AMPK activation phosphorylated and inhibited
ACC to reduce fatty acid synthesis while increasing catabolic
glucose oxidation. Interestingly, AMPK activation has been shown
to suppress FAS expression in primary cultured hepatocytes (53)
and in androgen-independent (DU145 and PC3) and androgensensitive (LNCaP) cells (64). Whereas chronic AMPK activation
may change the phenotype of cancer cells including FAS
expression, it is unlikely that the rapidity of the changes following
C93 treatment could be explained by reduced FAS expression
because the half-life of the enzyme in cancer cells is f12 h (data
not shown). Indeed, over the course of these experiments, no
changes in the FAS expression were identified by immunoblot.
Although the increased AMP/ATP ratio following C93 treatment
activated AMPK and increased glucose oxidation, the AMP/ATP
ratio continued to increase. Moreover, the oxidative potential of the
cells reflected in the NAD+/NADH ratio declined steadily 30 min
posttreatment. Thus, although glucose oxidation increased, it was
unable to compensate for the loss of ATP. The declining NAD+/
NADH ratio indicated a diminished capacity to further increase
catabolism in response to the increasing AMP/ATP ratio. The
anabolic redox couple NADP+/NADPH was also substantially
affected by C93 treatment. Within 10 min of treatment, NADPH
levels were significantly elevated, perhaps reflecting the rapid
inhibition of FAS leading to substrate accumulation. By 60 min,
however, the NADPH/NADP+ ratio began decreasing, which could
impede macromolecular synthesis. Indeed, potent inhibition of
DNA replication and S-phase progression in human cancer cells
was noted with both cerulenin and C75 treatment (24, 25).
If AMPK activation is responsible for triggering cytotoxicity,
prior treatment with compound C to block AMPK activation
should blunt the cytotoxic effect of FAS inhibition. Indeed,
pretreatment with compound C substantially rescued SKOV3
cells from C93 treatment. AMPK inactivation with compound C
had no significant cytotoxic effect on SKOV3 cells. These data
implicate AMPK activation in the cytotoxic mechanism of action of
pharmacologic FAS inhibition with C93.
Prior studies from our laboratory with human breast cancer cells
showed that FAS inhibition was substantially more cytotoxic than
ACC inhibition (18). These data suggested that substrate accumulation, not end-product ( fatty acid) depletion, was responsible for
the cytotoxicity. In SKOV3 cells, although the IC50 for pathway
inhibition with TOFA was >25-fold less than C93, the TOFA LC50 for
SKOV3 cells was 16-fold greater. Moreover, TOFA treatment did not
lead to AMPK phosphorylation. C93 and AICAR, both AMPK

with no cytotoxicity detected with TOFA.
To determine the efficacy and any potential toxicity of C93
in vivo, we treated i.p. and s.c. SKOV3 xenograft–bearing athymic
mice with C93 in two pilot studies. In the i.p. SKOV3 xenograft
model (20), C93 daily i.p. treatment (50 mg/kg) substantially
reduced tumor growth compared with vehicle controls with
no identifiable disease in three animals. We next studied s.c.
SKOV3 xenografts, escalating the dose to twice-daily C93
treatment for 2 weeks. The C93-treated mice had a 3-fold
reduction in tumor growth compared with vehicle controls.
Histopathology of the xenograft 4 h after treatment showed
evidence of ongoing cytotoxicity characterized by foci of acute
inflammation. No cytotoxic effect on other proliferating cell
compartments such as skin, gastrointestinal tract, or bone
marrow was noted.

The pharmacologic inhibition of FAS with C93 causes rapid
energy depletion, AMPK activation, and substantial cytotoxicity
in vitro. Pilot studies in the SKOV3 xenograft showed significant
antitumor effect without evidence of significant toxicity or weight
loss. Because FAS is up-regulated in cancer cells but not in normal
human tissues (69), pharmacologic FAS inhibition may provide a
means to selectively activate AMPK and induce a cytotoxic
response in ovarian cancer while sparing most of normal human
tissues from the pleiotropic effects of AMPK activation.
