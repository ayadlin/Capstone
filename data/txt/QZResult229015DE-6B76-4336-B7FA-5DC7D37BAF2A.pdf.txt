VEGF-A Silencing and Enriches Stem-like Cancer
Cells in Melanoma

Abstract
The basis for resistance to VEGF inhibition is not fully understood despite its clinical importance. In this study, we examined
the adaptive response to VEGF-A inhibition by a loss-of-function
analysis using plasmid-based shRNA. Tumor xenografts that
initially responded to VEGF-A inhibition underwent an adaptation in vivo, leading to acquired resistance. VEGF-A blockade in
tumors was associated with HIF1a expression and an increase in
CD144þ vasculogenic mimicry (VM), leading to formation of
channels displaying Tie-1 and MMP-2 upregulation. CD133þ and
CD271þ melanoma stem-like cells (MSLC) accumulated in the
perivascular niche. Tumor xenografts of melanoma cell populations that were intrinsically resistant to VEGF-A blockade did not
exhibit any of these features, compared with nontarget control

counterparts. Thus, melanomas that are initially sensitive to
VEGF-A blockade acquire adaptive resistance by adopting VM
as an alternate angiogenic strategy, thereby enriching for deposition of MSLC in the perivascular niche through an HIF1adependent process. Conversely, melanomas that are intrinsically resistant to VEGF-A blockade do not show any evidence
of compensatory survival mechanisms that promote MSLC
accumulation. Our work highlights the potential risk of antiVEGF treatments owing to a selective pressure for an adaptive
resistance mechanism that empowers the development of stemlike cancer cells, with implications for how to design combination therapies that can improve outcomes in patients. Cancer

Introduction

EphA2, Tie-1, and MMP-2 (10–13). VM channels provide an
alternate mechanism for nutrient supply and act as a potential
access point for metastases, and thus correlate with tumor aggressiveness and patient mortality (10). Gene-expression analysis has
revealed that VM-engaging melanoma subsets express genes associated with undifferentiated embryonic-like cells, suggesting the
participation of melanoma stem-like cells (MSLC) with the phenotypic plasticity to serve an endothelial function (8–18). In
agreement with these ﬁndings, we previously demonstrated that
CD133þ MSLCs colocalize to CD144þ VM-engaging melanoma
subsets in a perivascular MSLC niche (19). Thus, in response to
VEGF inhibition, MSCLs with the intrinsic ability to differentiate
and form VM channels may be selected. Although experimental
evidence to validate this proposal is limited, treatment of human
breast cancer xenografts with bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody, resulted in an increase in the cancer stem-like cell population (20). Furthermore, Wang and colleagues (21) showed that
blocking VEGF-A or its receptor, VEGFR-2, inhibited the maturation of tumor endothelial progenitors into endothelium, but
did not prevent the transendothelial differentiation of CD133þ
glioblastoma cells.
Despite speculation that VM induction and MSLC maintenance
might affect the effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapies, little
research supports this claim, and the mechanisms of adaptive
resistance following VEGF-A inhibition remain largely unknown.
In this study, we examined the adaptive response of WM1617,
C8161, and A2058 melanoma cell lines to VEGF-A inhibition in
the context of VM niche morphogenesis and MSLC subsets. We
hypothesized that tumors overcome VEGF-A inhibition by promoting niche morphogenesis through VM induction and MSLC
enrichment. Better understanding of the adaptive response to
VEGF-A inhibition will provide valuable insights for designing

Human malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer due
to its ability to metastasize and its resistance to conventional
anticancer treatments. Angiogenesis supports melanoma tumor
growth and metastasis by supplying the tumor with oxygen and
nutrients and providing tumor cells with an entry route into
circulation (1). Given that the key proangiogenic factor is considered to be VEGF-A, anti-VEGF therapies for the treatment of
melanoma have been studied extensively (2, 3). Unfortunately,
despite showing initial antitumor effects in a subset of patients,
anti-VEGF strategies achieved limited efﬁcacy in patients due to
the rapid development of resistance (3–6). This adaptive resistance is associated with increased invasion and metastasis of
cancer cells (6).
It has long been speculated that to escape anti-VEGF therapies,
tumors may use alternative vascularization mechanisms, including vasculogenic mimicry (VM; refs. 7–9). VM is a phenomenon in
which tumor cells mimic endothelial cells by undergoing transendothelial differentiation, characterized by their increased
expression of vascular markers, such as CD144 (VE-cadherin),

Loss of VEGF Induces Melanoma Niche Morphogenesis

new approaches to treat melanoma through effective combination therapies.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Melanoma cell lines, WM1617, WM983C, 1205Lu (obtained
from Dr. M. Herlyn at the Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA), and
C8161 (a kind gift from Dr. M.J.C. Hendrix at the Stanley Manne
Children's Research Institute, Northwestern University, Chicago,
IL), and A2058 cells (obtained from ATCC) were cultured as
previously described (22). All cell lines were tested within 6
months using the PowerPlex 18D system (Promega BioSciences).
VEGF-A knockdown in melanoma cells
VEGF-A silencing in WM1617, C8161, and A2058 melanoma
cells was achieved by SureSilencing shRNA pGeneClip plasmids
(SABiosciences). Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stable transfectants
were selected with 600 mg/mL G418 (Gibco Laboratories) and
subsequently subcloned to select the most efﬁcient knockdown
cells. VEGF-A knockdown (VEGF-A KD; sh1) and VEGF-A KD
(sh2) denote two independent shRNA sequences targeting
VEGF-A.
ELISA assay
Cell lysates were extracted in RIPA buffer (Pierce) and quantiﬁed by a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Equal amounts (100 mg) of protein were
subjected to the Human VEGF-A ELISA Kit (R&D Systems)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. In separate experiments for baseline VEFG-A measurement, tissue culture supernatant was collected from melanoma cells in serum-free medium
(5 mL/2  106 cells over a period of 14 hours) and subjected to the
Human VEGF-A ELISA Kit.
Growth assay
Growth assays were conducted in 6-well plates. Cells were
plated at the density of 10,000 cells per well. Cells were counted
after 4, 7, and 10 days. Each cell line was plated in triplicate and
the experiment was repeated at least three times with consistency.
Data presented represent results from one experiment, and data
were analyzed using the Student t test.
Soft agar assay
Three-dimensional soft agar clonogenic assays were conducted
in 6-well plates as previously described (23). Cells were plated at
the density of 10,000 cells per well. Colonies with more than ﬁve
cells were counted in 20 randomly chosen ﬁelds (100) after 10
days using an inverted microscope and the percentage of colony
formation was calculated. Each cell line was plated in triplicate
and the experiment was repeated three times with consistency.
The represented data are compiled from the independent repeats,
and data were analyzed using the Student t test.
Tubule formation assay for VM in vitro
Cells were plated at the density of 10,000 cells per well in 96well plates coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Luminal area
per ﬁeld (40) was observed after 24 hours using an inverted
microscope and analyzed using ImageJ software (National Insti-

www.aacrjournals.org

tutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Each cell line was plated in
triplicate, and the data were analyzed using the Student t test.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
RNA from melanoma cells and frozen tumor xenografts was
extracted using an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed
using the SuperScript III RT cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time quantitative
PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed subsequently on a StepOnePlus
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using human-speciﬁc primers. The primer sequences were as follows: CD133
forward 50 -TTCTTGACCGACTGAGAC-30 and reverse 50 -CCAAGCACAGAGGGTCAT-30 ; CD144 forward 50 -ATATGTCAGTGATGACTA-30 and reverse 50 -CTTACCAGGGCGTTCAGG-30 ; CD271
forward 50 -ACTCACTGCACAGACTCT-30 and reverse 50 -GAAGCTTCTCAACGGCTC-30 ; MMP-2 forward 50 -TTTCCATTCCGCTTCCAGGGCAC-30 and reverse 50 -TCGCACACCACATCTTTCCGTCACT-30 (24); Tie-1 forward 50 -CACGACCATGACGGCGAAT-30 and reverse 50 -CGGCAGCCTGATATGCCTG-30 (25); and
GAPDH forward 50 -CGACCACTTTGTCAAGCTCA-30 and reverse
50 -AGGGGAGATTCAGTGTGGTG-30 . All samples were run in
triplicate and normalized to the housekeeping gene, GAPDH.
Data were analyzed using the 2DDCt method (26).
Western blotting
Cell lysates and xenograft tissue homogenates were extracted in
RIPA buffer (Pierce) and quantiﬁed by a BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Equal amounts
(40–100 mg) of protein were subjected to electrophoresis and
transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were probed overnight
at 4 C with mouse anti-CD133 (Miltenyi Biotech Inc.; clone
W6B3C1) at 1:200, rabbit anti-CD271 (Alomone) at 1:1,000,
rabbit anti-CD144 (Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:1,000, or
mouse anti–b-actin (Abcam) at 1:5,000 followed by probing with
the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch). Immunoreactive bands
were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent
Substrate (Pierce). Densitometry measurements were performed
using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
MD); b-actin was used as a loading control.
Melanoma xenografts and in vivo tumorigenicity
Mice are maintained under pathogen-free conditions in an
American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care-accredited facility at the Boston University Medical Center,
under the supervision of the Laboratory Animal Science Center
and its staff of veterinarians and support personnel. To determine
the effects of VEGF-A downregulation on tumorigenicity, 2  105
WM1617 or A2058 melanoma cells transfected with control or
VEGF-A shRNA constructs were injected s.c. in the dorsal skin of
each severe combined immune-deﬁciency (SCID) mouse (CB17;
Taconic Laboratory; 5 mice/condition). In a separate experiment,
to ensure the generation of sizable VEGF-A KD xenografts for
various analyses, 2  106 WM1617, C8161, or A2058 control
or VEGF-A KD melanoma cells were injected per mouse
(5 mice/group). Tumor volume was monitored and determined
as the volume of ellipsoid: 4/3p(width/2length/2height/2).
Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA. Melanoma
xenografts were harvested when tumors reached 1 cm3. Xenografts

were subjected to various analyses, including immunoﬂuorescence, qRT-PCR, and Western Blot analyses.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Consecutive frozen melanoma xenograft sections were subjected to double indirect immunoﬂuorescence according to standard protocols. The primary antibodies used were rabbit antihuman CD144 (Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:100, biotinylated
anti-human CD133 (Miltenyl Biotec Inc.) at 1:20, rabbit antihuman CD271 (Alomone) at 1:100, and rat anti-mouse CD31
(BD Biosciences) at 1:50. The secondary antibodies used were
FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Accurate Chemical &
Scientiﬁc Corporation) at 1:100, FITC-conjugated mouse antibiotin IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:100, and TRITC-goat
anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:100. For control,
isotype-matched immunoglobins (Vector Laboratories) were
used in place of the primary antibody. Sections were mounted
with Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and
examined under a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope equipped with
FITC and TRITC ﬁlters (Nikon) and a Mercury-100W lamp (Chiu
Technical Corporation). Host angiogenesis (mCD31þ) and
human melanoma–derived VM channels (hCD144þ) were quantiﬁed as measured by luminal area per ﬁeld (100) using ImageJ
software, and data were analyzed using the Student t test.

PCR array
RNA from melanoma cells and frozen tumors was extracted
using an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). The RT2 Proﬁle pathway-focused
PCR array speciﬁc for human angiogenesis were purchased from
SABiosciences. The complete gene lists for the PCR arrays are
available on the SABioscience's website (http://www.sabiosciences.com/). Web-based software provided by the supplier was
used to analyze the PCR data.
Statistical analysis
Differences between two groups were analyzed using the Student t test. Differences between more than two groups were
analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Two-sided P values of less than
0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

Results
VEGF-A silencing in melanoma by plasmid-based shRNA
Using ELISA, we screened ﬁve melanoma cell lines, including
WM1617, WM983C, 1205Lu, A2058, and C8161 cells, for
VEGF-A expression. On the basis of this screening, the amounts
of secreted VEGF-A in the tissue culture supernatant (Fig. 1A
left) correlate with those of the cytoplasmic fraction in cell
lysates (Fig. 1A, right), and WM1617, C8161 and A2058 cells
exhibited the highest level of VEGF-A expression (Fig. 1A).

VEGF-A KD retards tumorigenicity in WM1617 but not C8161

Given that WM1617 VEGF-A KD (sh1), C8161 VEGF-A KD
(sh1), and A2058 VEGF-A KD (sh1) cells exhibited the greatest
VEGF-A KD efﬁciency, we chose to use these cells for our in vivo
studies. In two separate tumorigenicity assays in which mice were
injected with 2  106 (Fig. 3A) 2  105 (Supplementary Fig. S2A)
melanoma cells, VEGF-A KD signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) retarded

VEGF-A KD attenuates WM1617 and C8161 but not A2058
melanoma cell growth in vitro
To explore the effect of VEGF-A KD on cell proliferation in vitro,
we performed two-dimensional (2D) growth assays. VEGF-A KD
led to a decrease in WM1617 and C8161 cell growth (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. S1B). In contrast, VEGF-A KD in A2058 cells
did not modulate cell growth (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig.
S1B). These results highlight the differential effect of VEGF-A KD

on cell growth in different melanoma cell lines. In addition to 2D
growth assays, we examined anchorage-independent growth
using soft agar colony formation assays. VEGF-A KD did not alter
soft agar colony formation in WM1617, C8161, or A2058 cells
compared with nontarget control cells (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S1C). Furthermore, VEGF-A KD did not modulate VM
tubule formation in vitro, as measured by VM luminal area, in
WM1617 (P ¼ 0.490), C8161 (P ¼ 0.587), or A2058 (P ¼ 0.118)
cells (Fig. 2C).

Thus, we chose these cell lines to explore the functional role of
VEGF-A with regard to tumor growth and niche maintenance.
To test the biologic signiﬁcance of VEGF-A, we generated stable
VEGF-A KD in WM1617, C8161, and A2058 cells using two
independent plasmid-based shRNAs (sh1 and sh2). ELISA
revealed VEGF-A KD at the protein level in WM1617, C8161,
and A2058 cells in vitro compared with control cells expressing
nontarget shRNA (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1A). Quantitative RT-PCR veriﬁed downregulation of VEGF-A message
levels in vitro (Fig. 1C).

suggest that in the experimental setting WM1617 cells mirror the
initial responders in the clinic; that is, some melanomas are
initially sensitive to VEGF-A silencing, but subpopulations of
cells eventually develop adaptive resistance and survive (4–6).
In contrast, VEGF-A KD did not affect C8161 or A2058 tumor
growth in vivo, suggesting that C8161 and A2058 cells are intrinsically resistant to VEGF-A silencing and reﬂect the disease in
clinical nonresponders to anti-VEGF therapy (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2B). The efﬁciency of VEGF-A KD was veriﬁed in
WM1617, C8161, and A2058 xenografts using ELISA (Fig. 3B).
VEGF KD promotes VM and enriches MSLCs in WM1617 but not
C8161 or A2058 melanoma xenografts
To explore the biologic signiﬁcance of VEGF-A KD on niche
morphogenesis and MSLC homeostasis, we analyzed expression
of the VM marker, CD144, and the stem cell markers, CD133 and
CD271, in xenografts by real-time qRT-PCR using human-speciﬁc
primers and by Western blot analysis. We observed an increase in
both the message (Fig. 4A) and protein (Fig. 4B) levels of CD144,
CD133, and CD271 in VEGF-A KD WM1617 xenografts compared with their nontarget control counterparts, suggesting that
VEGF-A KD promotes VM and enriches the MSLC phenotype.
Interestingly, although we did not observe an increase in CD144
message levels in VEGF-A KD C8161 xenografts compared with
their nontarget control counterparts, we did observe an increase in
CD133 and CD271 message levels (Fig. 4A); however, VEGF-A KD
C8161 xenografts did not exhibit changes in CD144 or CD271
protein levels (Fig. 4B). VEGF-A KD A2058 xenografts did not
exhibit changes in CD144, CD133 or CD271 message levels or
CD144 or CD271 protein levels (Fig. 4A and 4B). Attempts to
examine CD133 in VEGF-A KD C8161 or A2058 xenografts using
Western blot analysis were unsuccessful due to sensitivity issues
(Fig. 4B).

Multilabel immunoﬂuorescence staining conﬁrmed that VEGFA KD WM1617 xenografts exhibit increased CD144þ VM-like
melanoma channel formation as measured by CD144þ luminal
area (P ¼ 0.0003; Fig. 5A), whereas no signiﬁcant change in mouse
CD31þ blood vessel formation was observed (P ¼ 0.074; Fig. 5A).
Thus, WM1617 VEGF-A KD xenografts exhibit a signiﬁcant
increase in the percentage of human tumor–derived VM channels
(hCD144þ) versus host angiogenesis (mCD31þ; P ¼ 0.0003; Fig
5A). In contrast, VEGF-A KD C8161 xenografts did not display
a change in CD144þ VM-like melanoma channel formation
(P ¼ 0.269), mouse CD31þ blood vessels (P ¼ 0.134) or the
percentage of human tumor–derived VM vessels versus host angiogenesis (P ¼ 0.417; Supplementary Fig. S3A, left). VEGF-A KD
A2058 xenografts also did not display a change in CD144þ VM-like
melanoma channel formation (P ¼ 0.946), mouse CD31þ blood
vessels (P ¼ 0.059) or the percentage of human tumor–derived VM
vessels versus host angiogenesis (P ¼ 0.287; Supplementary Fig.
S3A, right). PAS staining further conﬁrmed that VEGF-A KD
increases VM channels as measured by tubular length in WM1617
xenografts (P ¼ 0.0008), but not in C8161 xenografts (P ¼ 0.384)
or A2058 xenografts (P ¼ 0.624; Supplementary Fig. S4). Consistent with these ﬁndings, VM-associated genes, such as Tie-1 and
MMP-2 were signiﬁcantly upregulated in WM1617 but not C8161
or A2058 VEGF-A KD xenografts compared with the control
xenografts in an angiogenesis pathway-speciﬁc qRT-PCR array
(data not shown). These results were further validated by qRTPCR (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Immunoﬂuorescence staining also conﬁrmed the increase in
CD133þ and CD271þ MLSCs in the perivascular niche in close
association to CD144þ melanoma cell–lined VM channels in
VEGF-A KD WM1617 xenografts (Fig. 5A). No increase in
CD133þ or CD271þ MLSCs was observed in VEGF-A KD
C8161 or A2058 xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Collectively, these data suggest that WM1617 cells, which are initially
sensitive to VEGF-A silencing, eventually acquire adaptive

VEGF-A KD increases VM and MSLC markers in WM1617 melanoma xenografts. A, expression proﬁling by qRT-PCR revealed concomitant CD144, CD133,
and CD271 upregulation in WM1617 VEGF-A KD (sh1) xenografts compared with nontarget controls. A concomitant increase in CD133 and CD271, but
not CD144 was also observed in C8161 VEGF-A KD (sh1) xenografts compared with nontarget controls. No change in CD144, CD133, or CD271 expression was
observed in A2058 VEGF-A KD (sh1) xenografts compared with nontarget controls. No change in these markers was observed in WM1617, C8161, or
A2058 VEGF-A KD (sh1) cells compared with nontarget controls in vitro;  , P < 0.05. B, cell lysates (the forth panel) and xenograft homogenates (the
ﬁrst three panels) prepared from WM1617, C8161, and A2058 VEGF-A KD (sh1) and nontarget control melanoma cells were subjected to Western blotting.
b-Actin served as internal loading control. A signiﬁcant increase in CD144, CD133, and CD271 was observed in WM1617 VEGF-A KD (sh1) xenografts
compared with the nontarget controls (top, far left) as determined by densitometry (bottom, far left); no change in these markers was observed
in WM1617 VEGF-A KD (sh1) cells compared with nontarget controls in vitro (far right);  , P < 0.05. No change in CD144 or CD271 expression was observed in
C8161 or A2058 VEGF-A KD (sh1) xenografts (middle) or cells in vitro (far right) compared with nontarget controls. Unfortunately, despite maximal
loading (100 mg protein/lane) and prolonged exposure (overnight), the expression of CD133 was under the detection limit in both C8161 and A2058 xenografts
and cells in vitro (WM1617 lysate was included as a positive control). †, four out of ﬁve xenograft pairs generated were examined by Western blotting

resistance and survive through increased VM formation and MSLC
enrichment. In contrast, the C8161 and A2058 cells are intrinsically resistant to VEGF-A silencing and, therefore, fail to show
adaptive compensatory mechanisms.
WM1617 tumors compensate for VEGF-A KD by VM induction
possibly through an HIF1a-mediated mechanism
Of note, given that numerous studies have demonstrated that
HIF1a regulates VM and the cancer stem cell–like phenotype (27),
we observed an increase in HIF1a in WM1617 VEGF-A KD
xenografts but not in A2058 VEGF-A KD xenografts in an angiogenesis pathway-speciﬁc qRT-PCR array (data not shown). We
veriﬁed these results using qRT-PCR (Fig. 6A and Supplementary
Fig. S3B). Western blot analysis conﬁrmed an increase in HIF1a
protein levels in WM1617 VEGF-A KD xenografts (Fig. 6B).
Attempts to examine HIF1a expression in C8161 and A2058
VEGF-A KD xenografts were unsuccessful due to sensitivity issues.

Discussion
As melanomas are heterogeneous in the clinical setting, some
melanomas initially respond to anti-VEGF therapy, but eventually
develop clinical resistance, the so-called "initial responders,"
whereas other melanomas are intrinsically resistant and do not
respond to anti-VEGF therapy (4–6). In accord with frequent

www.aacrjournals.org

clinical relapses in "initial responders" following anti-VEGF treatments, we show that VEGF-A silencing initially inhibits WM1617
melanoma xenograft growth in vivo; however, tumors eventually
develop adaptive resistance and overcome VEGF-A inhibition.
Conversely, mirroring the clinical disease in nonresponders to
anti–VEGF-A therapy, we found that C8161 and A2058 cells are
intrinsically resistant to VEGF-A silencing. Compensatory survival
pathways in the initial responders to anti-VEGF therapies have
had a negative impact on their clinical effectiveness; however, the
mechanisms responsible for the adaptive resistance to anti–VEGFA therapies are largely unknown. Our studies reveal that VEGF-A
inhibition in WM1617 xenografts leads to an increase in CD144þ
melanoma cell–lined VM channels and associated VM markers,
Tie-1 and MMP-2, providing evidence that VM induction results
from an adaptive response to VEGF-A inhibition. C8161 and
A2058 xenografts, which were intrinsically resistant to VEGF-A
silencing, failed to show adaptive compensatory mechanisms and
did not exhibit an increase in VM formation. Taken together, our
data suggest that some melanomas develop adaptive resistance to
VEGF-A inhibition by increasing VM, an alternate vascularization
mechanism to angiogenesis, which is essential in supplying
tumors with oxygen and nutrients to support tumor growth (10).
The role of VEGF signaling in regulating VM has been
widely studied, however, it remains controversial. Initial

reports demonstrated that VEGF-A stimulation did not affect VM
(28). Consistent with these reports, VEGF neutralizing antibody
bevacizumab failed to modulate VM formation in glioblastoma
cells in vitro, and AG28262, a selective inhibitor of VEGFR-1, R-2,
and R-3, did not modulate glioblastoma-derived VM channels in
vivo (29, 30). Conversely, VEGF-A downregulation abolished VM
in osteosarcoma cells in vitro and VEGFR-2 downregulation
reduced VM formation in glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo
(30–33). In melanoma, VEGFR-1 expression on MSLCs has been
shown to promote tumor growth via increased VM formation
(34). As stated above, our data demonstrate that VM is increased in
some melanomas following VEGF-A inhibition. Such discrepancies of the role of VEGF signaling in modulating VM formation
may reﬂect cell type- and/or cell line-speciﬁc differences, and
emphasize the importance of the cellular context in determining
the response to VEGF-A inhibition.
VM and stem cell signaling pathways are intertwined in the
tumor microenvironment (35). Gene-expression analysis has
revealed that VM-engaging melanoma subsets express genes associated with undifferentiated embryonic-like cells, suggesting the
participation of MSLCs with the phenotypic plasticity to serve an
endothelial function (10–15, 36). Furthermore, we previously
demonstrated that CD133þ MSLCs colocalize to CD144þ
VM-engaging melanoma subsets in a perivascular MSLC niche,
and Valyi-Nagy and colleagues (37) showed that VM-forming uveal
melanoma cells preferentially express the stem cell marker CD271þ
(19). Parallel to these reports, we found that VM induction following VEGF-A inhibition leads to a concurrent increase in CD133þ
and CD271þ MSLCs in the perivascular niche of WM1617 xeno-

grafts, but not in C8161 or A2058 xenografts, suggesting that some
melanomas adapt to VEGF-A inhibition through enrichment of
MSLCs, which exhibit the intrinsic ability to differentiate and form
VM channels. Highlighting the importance of the microenvironment in supporting VM induction and MSLC maintenance, we did
not observe changes in (i) CD144, CD133 or CD271 expression, (ii) VM induction, or (iii) growth in soft agar following
VEGF-A KD in WM1617 cells in vitro. These observations
support the view that the dynamic niche microenvironment is
imperative in providing the essential cues for cell fate determination, including the phenotypic and functional rendering
of VM channels and MSLC enrichment (19, 35, 38–40).
As a result of pruning the tumor vasculature, anti-VEGF therapies lead to an increase in hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment (41, 42). Emerging evidence suggests that therapy-induced
hypoxia may be a contributing factor to the disappointing clinical
results of anti-VEGF strategies (41, 42). Hypoxia, either in the
transient or persistent state, is a hallmark of cancer. HIF1a, the
main mediator of hypoxia has been shown to regulate pathways
involved in the maintenance of the cancer stem cell–like phenotype, angiogenesis and VM (27, 43, 44). Of note, melanomas with
high VM capability also display increased HIF1a expression levels
(45). Here, we report that VEGF-A inhibition in WM1617 xenografts leads to a concomitant increase in VM and HIF1a, suggesting that hypoxia-induced HIF1a expression may be one important in vivo environmental cue promoting VM induction and
MSLC maintenance (Fig. 6C; ref. 27). Parallel to our ﬁndings,
tumors from glioblastoma multiforme patients treated with bevacizumab, an anti–VEGF-A antibody, exhibit an increase in HIF1a

expression (46). Furthermore, daily administration of topotecan,
an HIF1a inhibitor, in combination with bevacizumab synergistically attenuates tumor growth and angiogenesis in a glioma
xenograft model (47). Future work should further examine
whether HIF1a downregulation prevents the increase in VM
induction and MSLC maintenance following VEGF-A inhibition
in melanoma.
In summary, our work reveals that, although VEGF-A silencing
attenuates WM1617 cell growth in vivo, tumors compensate for
VEGF-A KD by adopting VM, thereby promoting perivascular
MSLC niche morphogenesis and MSLC enrichment potentially
via an HIF1a-mediated mechanism. In contrast, C8161 and
A2058 cells are intrinsically resistant to VEGF-A silencing and,
therefore, fail to show adaptive compensatory survival mechanisms. Our ﬁndings are critical in understanding the mechanisms
of adaptive resistance in some melanomas following treatment
with anti-VEGF agents. Future work should examine the speciﬁc
signaling pathways involved in the adaptive response to VEGF-A
inhibition. Uncovering the speciﬁc effectors of VM-induction and
MSLC maintenance will be essential in discovering novel therapeutic targets to treat melanoma through combination therapies
that simultaneously target angiogenesis and the MSLC niche.
