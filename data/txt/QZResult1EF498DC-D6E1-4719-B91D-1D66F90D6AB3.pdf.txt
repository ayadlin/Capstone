BACKGROUND. Tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) gene mutations of the epidermal
growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) have proven to be clinically significant in
nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in adenocarcinoma. However,
TKD mutations together with deletion mutations in the extracellular domain of
EGFR (EGFRvIII) have not been fully investigated in NSCLC except for adenocarcinoma. The present study sought to gain further insight into the significance of
EGFR mutations in NSCLC by focusing on nonadenocarcinoma NSCLC.

METHODS. EGFR TKD mutations were investigated using direct sequencing and
mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and EGFRvIII mutations
were examined using reverse transcriptase-PCR in samples from 42 NSCLC
patients and 6 NSCLC cell lines excluding adenocarcinoma.

RESULTS. EGFR TKD mutations were detected in 1 of 7 (14%) squamous-cell carcinomas with an adenocarcinoma component and 2 of 4 (50%) adenosquamous
carcinomas. In contrast, EGFR TKD mutations were not identified in 24 pure
squamous-cell carcinomas without any adenocarcinoma component, 7 large-cell
carcinomas, or 6 cell lines. EGFRvIII was detected solely in 1 of 7 large-cell carcinomas (14%), but not in 31 squamous-cell carcinomas, 4 adenosquamous carcinomas, or 6 cell lines.

CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that EGFR TKD mutations are found in
NSCLCs with an adenocarcinoma element. Patients with such lesions are thus
considered

arious mutations within the epidermal growth factor receptor
gene (EGFR) have recently been found in nonsmall-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC).1–17 These mutations tend to cluster in the tyrosine
kinase domain (TKD) of the gene. The potential impact of EGFR
mutations in NSCLC has attracted substantial attention from
researchers and clinicians because the presence of mutations may
critically influence the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs),
such as gefitinib and erlotinib, against lung cancer. Numerous studies have suggested that gefitinib is more effective against tumors
harboring EGFR mutations than against tumors without such

mutations, and similar results have been reported for
erlotinib, although these hypotheses have yet to be
confirmed in randomized controlled studies.1–3,6–9,11
These types of mutations are widely recognized as
occurring more frequently in adenocarcinomas than
in tumors of other histology.2–17 The frequency of
EGFR TKD mutations in NSCLC except for adenocarcinoma is reported to be generally low (Table 1). These
results lead clinicians to refrain from using gefitinib on
patients with nonadenocarcinoma NSCLC. However, a
subset of nonadenocarcinoma NSCLCs has been
reported as harboring EGFR mutations in several studies.2–5,7–11,14,16,17 These findings prompted us to
investigate whether nonadenocarcinoma NSCLCs with
EGFR mutations display any specific clinical features.
Deletion of exons 2–7 in EGFR gene (EGFRvIII),
which is often found in glioblastoma,18 has also been
identified in a subset of NSCLC patients, although the

frequency of this mutation appears to vary (Table 2).19–22
EGFRvIII is also a possible target of TKIs, and revealing
the presence of EGFRvIII mutation in NSCLC is thus
considered clinically relevant.22 However, EGFRvIII
has not been investigated in NSCLC as intensively as
EGFR TKD mutations. We previously reported that,
similar to patients in Western countries, EGFRvIII is
very rare in lung adenocarcinoma among Japanese.23
The present study also investigated EGFRvIII in nonadenocarcinoma NSCLC to elucidate whether EGFRvIII
has any contribution to tumorigenesis for this type of
lung cancer.
Furthermore, overexpression of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) has also been shown to be
related to EGFR mutations23 and susceptibility to
TKIs in NSCLC.11 We therefore investigated EGFR
expression in these samples to explore whether this
has any impact on nonadenocarcinoma NSCLC.

EGFR Status in Nonadenocarcinoma NSCLC/Ohtsuka et al.

Overall, this study was intended to reveal whether
nonadenocarcinoma NSCLCs contain EGFR abnormalities and can thus be possible targets of molecular
therapy. We demonstrate herein that EGFR TKD mutations are not rare in NSCLCs with an adenocarcinoma
component and EGFRvIII can be found in patients
with large-cell carcinoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
A total of 96 consecutive Japanese patients with NSCLC
underwent surgery in the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Kyorin University Hospital between May 2001
and March 2003. Postoperative diagnoses were made
by trained pathologists. Patients diagnosed with squamous-cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or
large-cell carcinoma were enrolled for further analysis.
Pathological diagnosis was based on the criteria of the
World Health Organization classification system.24
Briefly, squamous-cell carcinoma comprises tumors
with <10% adenocarcinoma component. In particular,
squamous-cell carcinoma without a detectable adenocarcinoma component was termed ‘pure squamouscell carcinoma’ in this study. Adenosquamous carcinoma comprises tumors with a 10% to 90% adenocarcinoma component. Adenocarcinoma comprises
tumors with a >90% adenocarcinoma component, and
patients with this diagnosis were excluded from the
present study. After surgery, some patients underwent
chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy with various regimens, including gefitinib therapy in 5 patients with recurrence. Written informed consent to analyze tissue
DNA, RNA, and protein was obtained from each
patient before operation. Results of molecular analyses
on these patients have not previously been reported.
Patient Data
Clinical data were obtained from in- and outpatient
medical records. The following criteria were used to
classify smoking status: never smoker, patients who
had smoked <100 cigarettes in their lifetime; former
smoker, patients who had stopped smoking 12
months before diagnosis; and current smoker.
Cell Lines and Clinical Samples
Lung squamous-cell carcinoma cell lines EBC-1, LK2,
and Sq-1 and large-cell carcinoma cell lines 86-2 and
Lu99 were obtained from the Cell Resource Center
for Biomedical Research, Tohoku University (Sendai,
Japan). Squamous-cell carcinoma cell line RERF-LCAI was purchased from Riken Bioresource Center
(Tsukuba, Japan). Lung adenocarcinoma cell lines
NCI-H1650 and H1975, which have been reported to

743

show delE746-A750 and L858R, respectively, were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and used as positive controls for
EGFR TKD mutations.25 The glioblastoma cell line
U87MGDEGFRSH, which has been reported to show
EGFRvIII, was kindly donated by Professor Webster
K. Cavenee (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research,
San Diego) and was used as a positive control for
EGFRvIII mutation.26 Tumor samples and visually
normal lung tissues distant from the tumor were immediately frozen after resection and preserved at
808C. Visually normal lung tissues were confirmed
as containing no tumor component on pathological
examination. DNA, RNA, and protein were extracted
from these samples and cell lines according to methods previously described.23

Direct Sequencing of EGFR TKD
Mutations of EGFR in lung cancer cluster within
exons 18–21, a main portion of TKD.1,2 Direct
sequencing analysis of EGFR from exons 18–21 using
genomic DNA was therefore performed, as previously
reported,23 for all NSCLC samples, including the 8
NSCLC cell lines.
EGFR TKD Mutation-Specific PCR
Lung cancer samples are frequently intermingled
with large amounts of normal tissue. In addition,
several NSCLC cell lines tested herein reportedly harbor an L858R mutation in only a minor population
of cells (1%–10%). The sensitivity of sequencing analysis, which usually needs >30% mutant DNA, was
thus insufficient to detect mutations in such contaminated tumor samples. A mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method that we
previously developed was thus used to detect the
major EGFR TKD mutations with high sensitivity.
This method can simultaneously detect delE746A750 and L858R, which together account for approximately 70% of EGFR TKD mutations, with a low percentage of mutant DNA (2.5% for delE746-A750 and
0.25% for L858R) being detectable. The precise
method has been described elsewhere.27 In brief,
PCR was performed with 100 ng of extracted DNA
and primers specific for delE746-A750 and L858R
were added together with the PCR mix. PCR conditions were as follows: 958C for 5 minutes; then
45 cycles of 958C for 30 seconds, 568C for 30 seconds,
and 728C for 30 seconds; followed by a final 10 minutes at 728C. Consequently, a 153-bp band and a
104-bp band are detected in samples containing
delE746-A750 and L858R, respectively. For the detection of delT751-K758, we set up PCR amplifying the
area of DNA including this deletion. This PCR can

extracted from both squamous-cell carcinoma and
adenocarcinoma components.

Analysis of EGFRvIII
EGFRvIII is generated by total deletion of exons 2–7
(801 bp) in the extracellular domain of the EGFR
gene. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is reportedly useful in detecting this deletion in glioblastoma,18 and was thus used in this study. For
detecting the 801-bp deletion, tumor cDNA and primers were subjected to 40 cycles of PCR amplification. PCR primers used were as follows: sense, 50 GTA TTG ATC GGG AGA GCC G-30 ; antisense, 50 -GTG
GAG ATC GCC ACT GAT G-30 .23 In addition, direct
sequencing was used to confirm the presence of
EGFRvIII in samples showing positive results according to RT-PCR. The sense primer for RT-PCR was also
used as a primer for sequencing analysis.

Statistical Analysis
The significance of differences in categorical data
was tested using the v2 test or Fisher exact test.

Western Blotting
Western blotting was used to analyze expression of
EGFR protein rather than immunohistochemistry, as
the results of the latter method are considered less
quantitative and reproducible than the former.28 For
EGFR Western blotting analysis, 100 lg of tumor or
normal lung protein was used. Protein samples were
subjected to Western blotting analyses using antiEGFR polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biologicals,
Santa Cruz, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The level of expression in each tumor
was determined as follows: (0), very weak or no
EGFR band (170 kD), similar to normal lung; (1), easily visible band; and (2), very strong band similar to
levels of b-actin. An EGFR expression level of 1 or 2
was defined as indicating EGFR overexpression.23
Microdissection
To elucidate which component includes EGFR TKD
mutations in tumors containing both adenocarcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma components,
separate mutational analysis of each component was
performed using microdissection techniques. For adenosquamous carcinomas and squamous-cell carcinomas with an adenocarcinoma component, a
trained expert pathologist performed laser capture
microdissection using LM200 (Arcturus, Mountain
View, CA) and manual microdissection of both squamous-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma component on 8 lm-thick hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)stained, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded histology
sections. DNA was extracted from each microdissected tissue by incubation with proteinase K
(200 lg/mL) for 24 hours at 378C, and EGFR TKD
mutation-specific PCR was performed using DNA

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Postoperative pathological examinations revealed 42
nonadenocarcinoma NSCLCs (31 squamous-cell carcinomas, 7 large-cell carcinomas, and 4 adenosquamous carcinomas) among 96 NSCLC tumors. The 31
squamous-cell carcinomas comprised 24 pure squamous-cell carcinomas (77%) and 7 squamous-cell
carcinomas with an adenocarcinoma component
(23%). Patient characteristics in the present study are
summarized in Table 3. Patients comprised 39 men
(93%) and 3 women (7%) with a median age of 73
years (range, 40–84 years), and 30 current smokers
(71%), 8 former smokers (19%), and 4 never smokers
(10%).
EGFR Mutations in Cell Lines
Sequencing analysis revealed delE746-A750 mutation in H1650 and L858R mutation in H1975, as previously reported.23 In contrast, no squamous-cell
carcinoma cell lines or large-cell carcinoma cell
lines displayed EGFR TKD mutations even according
to mutation-specific PCR (data not shown). The absence of L858R mutations in squamous-cell carcinomas tested in the present study (LK2, EBC-1, Sq-1,
and RERF-LC-AI) was inconsistent with the previous
study demonstrating that these lines harbor the
L858R mutation in various proportions of cells (LK2,
1%; EBC-1 and Sq-1, 10%; RERF-LC-AI, 100%).29 RTPCR and direct sequencing revealed the EGFRvIII
mutation only in the U87MGDEGFRSH glioblastoma cell line, but not in any lung cancer cell lines
(Fig. 1).
EGFR TKD Mutations in Patient Samples
EGFR mutations in TKD found in patient samples in
this study are summarized in Table 3. Mutations
within exons 18–21 were found in 1 of 31 squamouscell carcinomas (3%; including 7 squamous-cell carcinomas with an adenocarcinoma component), and
in 2 of 4 adenosquamous carcinomas by direct
sequencing. No cryptic mutations were detected by
mutation-specific PCR in tumor samples negative
for mutations by direct sequencing. Case 33 had
both delT751-K758 and I759N mutations, although
the biological significance of the latter mutation is

squamous-cell carcinoma with TKD mutation displayed an adenocarcinoma component. These findings indicate that all mutated cases were tumors
with an adenocarcinoma component, and none of
the 24 ‘pure squamous-cell carcinoma,’ cases
showed TKD mutation (Table 3). When the squamous-cell carcinoma with an adenocarcinoma com-

ponent and adenosquamous carcinoma were

have TKD mutations. The difference in frequency
of TKD mutations between tumors with or without an adenocarcinoma component was significant
(P ¼ .007). No large-cell carcinomas contained an
adenocarcinoma component or displayed TKD mutations. In addition, no significant correlations between

EGFR Expression in Patient Samples
EGFR overexpression was present in 25 of the 31 squamous-cell carcinomas (81%), 3 of 4 adenosquamous
carcinomas (75%), and 7 of 7 large-cell carcinomas
(100%) (Fig. 3, Table 3). EGFR TKD mutations were
identified in 3 of the 35 samples with EGFR overexpression (9%) and 1 of 7 samples without overexpression
(14%). No significant correlation was noted between
EGFR overexpression and mutation (P ¼ .421).

DISCUSSION
This study analyzed EGFR gene mutations in detail in
nonadenocarcinoma NSCLCs. Most strikingly, EGFR
TKD mutations were found exclusively in tumors with

an adenocarcinoma component, including adenosquamous carcinomas. Although many studies have
reported that EGFR TKD mutations are exceptional in
squamous-cell carcinoma, our results suggest that
these mutations are not very rare in squamous-cell
carcinoma with an adenocarcinoma component and
adenosquamous carcinoma. Whereas no reliable data
appear to be available regarding the frequency of
squamous-cell carcinomas with an adenocarcinoma
component, adenosquamous-cell carcinoma reportedly comprises 3% of all NSCLCs.30 Our results suggest that a substantial portion of nonadenocarcinoma
NSCLCs may harbor an EGFR mutation, and thorough
histologic investigation to identify an adenocarcinoma
component or genetic analyses to identify EGFR mutations are warranted for squamous-cell carcinomas.
Previous studies investigating EGFR mutations
have not precisely described whether the squa-

FIGURE 3. Analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein expression by Western blotting. EGFR protein expression was classified into 3 levels:
(2), (1), and (0). Three representative samples (each corresponding to expression level (2), (1), and (0), respectively) together with a normal lung sample representing expression level (0) and the cell line H1650 representing level (2) are shown on the same blot. Expression of b-actin of the corresponding samples is
shown below.

mous-cell carcinomas analyzed included an adenocarcinoma component, and many have even failed
to separately analyze adenosquamous carcinomas.
Actually, concordant with our results, studies discriminating adenosquamous carcinomas from squamous-cell carcinomas have uniformly shown that
only the former type of tumors harbor mutations.14,16 In the present study, microdissection
analysis was performed to explore whether these
mutations are restricted to an adenocarcinoma
component. Consistent with the previous report,31
EGFR TKD mutations were found in both adenocarcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma components.
These findings may suggest that squamous-cell carcinomas with an adenocarcinoma component are
intrinsically different from pure squamous-cell carcinomas, and that an EGFR TKD mutation might
have occurred in common progenitor cells destined
to become both cell types in these tumors. However, the possibility remains that these findings are
simply the result of artifacts due to contamination
between the 2 cell types during analyses. Further
studies are required to investigate biological differences between pure squamous-cell carcinomas and
squamous-cell carcinomas with an adenocarcinoma
component.
In addition to implications in tumorigenic
mechanisms of EGFR TKD mutations, these results
are also clinically important because patients with
EGFR TKD mutations may be susceptible to TKI
treatment. To date, no studies have precisely analyzed gefitinib sensitivity for squamous-cell carcinoma with an adenocarcinoma component. Similar
to adenocarcinomas with mutations, the squamouscell carcinoma component of these types of tumors
with mutations may be susceptible to gefitinib therapy regardless of histology. Because of the small
number of patients treated using gefitinib in this
cohort, the efficacy of gefitinib could not be analyzed

in our patients. Future studies with large subject
populations will clarify this issue.
RT-PCR analysis of the extracellular domain of
EGFR revealed that, similar to adenocarcinomas analyzed previously,23 EGFRvIII is very rare in nonadenocarcinoma NSCLCs. In contrast, several reports
have demonstrated that as much as 32% of NSCLCs,
irrespective of histology, show this type of mutation.19,21 This discrepancy may be attributable to the
methods applied to detect EGFRvIII. The quality of
antibody might influence rates of this mutation in
previous studies using immunohistochemistry with
EGFRvIII antibody. Most recently, a study investigating EGFRvIII in a large number of patients using RTPCR has shown that, consistent with our results, this
mutation is very rare in NSCLCs and found only in
nonadenocarcinomas. These findings indicate that
EGFRvIII contributes to tumor development in only
a minor subset of NSCLCs.
In addition to EGFR mutations, we also analyzed
EGFR protein expression in nonadenocarcinoma
NSCLCs using Western blotting. EGFR protein overexpression was found in 35 of 42 nonadenocarcinoma NSCLCs (83%). Patients in our cohort thus
showed a higher frequency of EGFR protein overexpression than those in a previous meta-analysis,28
which may be because of differences in ethnicity.
Whereas we have previously reported that EGFR
overexpression is strongly correlated with TKD mutations in adenocarcinomas,23 no such correlation was
demonstrated in the present study for nonadenocarcinoma NSCLCs. This may be explained by differences in the histology of the tumors, although a
definitive conclusion cannot be reached because of
the small number of patients with TKD mutations in
the present study. One recent report suggests that
EGFR protein overexpression contributes more
strongly to TKI susceptibility than EGFR TKD mutations.11 Although gefitinib has failed to show clinical

efficacy in nonadenocarcinoma NSCLC patients,32
other TKIs such as erlotinib or anti-EGFR antibody
drugs may prove beneficial for tumors with EGFR
overexpression.
In conclusion, we clarified that a subset of nonadenocarcinoma NSCLCs contains EGFR mutations.
In particular, EGFR TKD mutations are not rare
events in NSCLCs with an adenocarcinoma component. These molecular abnormalities will not only
provide insights into the tumorigenesis and oncologic properties of these tumors, but will also render
them possible targets for molecular therapies.
