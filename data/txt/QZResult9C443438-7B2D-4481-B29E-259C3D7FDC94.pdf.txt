Abstract
Restoration of the p53 pathway, namely by reactivation of mutant (mut) p53,
represents a valuable anticancer strategy. Herein, we report the identification
of the enantiopure tryptophanol-derived oxazoloisoindolinone SLMP53-1 as a
novel reactivator of wild-type (wt) and mut p53, using a yeast-based screening
strategy. SLMP53-1 has a p53-dependent anti-proliferative activity in human wt
and mut p53R280K-expressing tumor cells. Additionally, SLMP53-1 enhances p53
transcriptional activity and restores wt-like DNA binding ability to mut p53R280K.
In wt/mut p53-expressing tumor cells, SLMP53-1 triggers p53 transcriptiondependent and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways involving BAX, and wt/mut
p53 mitochondrial translocation. SLMP53-1 inhibits the migration of wt/mut
p53-expressing tumor cells, and it shows promising p53-dependent synergistic effects
with conventional chemotherapeutics. In xenograft mice models, SLMP53-1 inhibits
the growth of wt/mut p53-expressing tumors, but not of p53-null tumors, without
apparent toxicity. Collectively, besides the potential use of SLMP53-1 as anticancer
drug, the tryptophanol-derived oxazoloisoindolinone scaffold represents a promissing
starting point for the development of effective p53-reactivating drugs.

reactivation represents a highly effective strategy in cancer
treatment [1].
The majority of p53 mutations are missense,
preferentially localized in the DNA binding domain. They
can be classified as structural (e.g., R175H, Y220C) or
DNA contact (e.g., R273H, R280K) based on whether
or not they lead to a profound protein conformational
change, respectively. However, both types of mutations
prevent the p53 binding to DNA, leading to the loss of
wild-type (wt) p53 transcriptional activity [1–4].
Additionally, TP53 mutations may lead to the acquisition

Introduction
The p53 transcription factor finely regulates the
expression of genes with central roles in cellular processes
including DNA repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis [1, 2].
Compelling evidence has demonstrated that inactivation
of the p53 pathway is required for tumor development
and maintenance. In fact, in all human cancers bearing
p53, this protein is inactivated by binding to endogenous
inhibitors, such as murine double minute (MDM)2,
or by mutation of the TP53 gene [1, 2]. Therefore, p53

of gain-of-function (GOF) activities, responsible for more
aggressive tumor phenotypes with increased invasive
and metastatic potential, high chemoresistance, and poor
prognosis [3–5]. Moreover, high levels of mutant (mut)
p53 are often found in tumors due to a reduced MDM2
expression, and consequent impairment of p53 degradation
[3]. Collectively, these observations support that mut p53
is a promising therapeutic target against a wide range of
aggressive tumors [3–5].
To date, few small-molecule reactivators of mut p53
have been identified. Actually, due to its structural nature,
the restoration of wt-like function to mut p53 has been
challenging. Moreover, for most of the reported mut p53
reactivators, unfavorable pharmacokinetics and toxicity
profiles have been described [6]. In fact, so far, only the
PRIMA-1 derivative, APR-246, has reached clinical trials
[1–3]. Therefore, more pharmacological alternatives for
mut p53 reactivation are still required.
In this work, the enantiopure tryptophanol-derived
oxazoloisoindolinone SLMP53-1 (Figure 1A) was
identified as a new reactivator of wt and mut p53R280K.
This compound revealed in vitro and in vivo p53-dependent
antitumor activity, both alone and combined with
conventional chemotherapeutics, against tumors bearing
wt/mut p53.

of the replacement of the phenyl moiety (present in our
first set of compounds [10]) by an indole moiety. Among
the compounds tested, SLMP53-1 behaved as an activator
of wt p53 and reactivator of mut p53R280K (Figure 1B
and 1C). Actually, at 10 µM (lowest concentration, from
a range of 1–50 µM, that caused a maximal effect; data
not shown), SLMP53-1 increased the wt p53-induced yeast
growth inhibition and restored the wt-like growth inhibitory
effect to mut p53R280K (in about 79%; Figure 1B),
without interfering with the growth of control yeast (data
not shown). Consistently, 10 µM SLMP53-1 increased the
S- and G2/M-phases cell cycle arrest in wt p53-expressing
yeast, and reestablished the wt-like cell cycle arrest in mut
p53R280K-expressing yeast (Figure 1C). Interestingly,
1–50 µM SLMP53-1 did not interfere with the growth of
mut p53Y220C-expressing yeast (Figure 1B).
A previous work [13] corroborated the conservation
in yeast of the p53 transcriptional activity, and established
its correlation with p53-induced growth inhibition using
pifithrin-α (PFT-α; known selective inhibitor of p53
transcriptional activity [14]). Accordingly with previous
results [13], in the present work, the treatment of yeast
cells expressing wt p53 with 5 µM PFT-α reduced the wt
p53-induced growth inhibition by 68.0 ± 1.1% (n = 4).
Additionally, in the presence of 5 µM PFT-α, 10 µM
SLMP53-1 increased the wt p53-inhibitory effect by only
5.8 ± 0.8% (n = 4; relative to PFT-α only). A similar result
was obtained with yeast cells expressing mut p53R280K.
In fact, in these cells, 10 µM SLMP53-1 induced a mut
p53 inhibitory effect of 2.5 ± 1.1% (n = 4; relative to
PFT-α only). These results established a correlation
between the activation of p53 transcriptional activity
by SLMP53-1 and its cytotoxicity in yeast, since in the
presence of a p53 transcriptional inhibitor, the activity of
SLMP53-1 was abolished.

Results
Identification of SLMP53-1 as activator of wt p53
and reactivator of mut p53R280K from a yeast
screening of a library of tryptophanol-derived
oxazoloisoindolinones
A yeast-based screening assay, consisting of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing human wt
p53 or mut p53 (R280K or Y220C; two of the most
prevalent forms of human mut p53 [7]), was developed
to search for mut p53 reactivators (Figure 1B). This assay
was established based on the yeast growth inhibitory
effect induced by wt p53, but not by mut p53 [8]. Based
on this phenotypic readout, mut p53 reactivators would
reestablish the wt p53-dependent growth inhibition. Since,
to date, mut p53R280K reactivators remain unknown, the
mut p53Y220C reactivator PhiKan083 [9] was used to
attest the efficacy of the yeast assay (Figure 1B). In yeast,
50 µM PhiKan083 restored the wt p53-induced growth
inhibition to mut p53Y220C (in about 63%; Figure 1B).
This yeast assay was thereafter used to evaluate the
effect of synthesized enantiopure tryptophanol-derived
oxazoloisoindolinones on wt and mut p53 activity. These
compounds were synthesized following our interest in
enantiopure biologically active amino alcohol-derived
compounds [10–12], and on our previous discovery
of phenylalaninol-derived oxazoloisoindolinones with
in vitro p53-dependent antitumor activity [10]. With this
new library, we intended to study the effect on p53 activity

Growth inhibitory effect of SLMP53-1 on wt
p53- and mut p53R280K-expressing tumor cells
is mediated by a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest
and/or apoptosis
The growth inhibitory potential of SLMP53-1, and
the contribution of the p53 pathway to its activity, were
ascertained in p53+/+ and p53−/− HCT116 tumor cells. A
significant difference between the GI50 (concentration
for 50% of maximal growth inhibition) values obtained
in p53+/+ (~16 µM) and p53−/− (~34 µM) HCT116 cells
indicated an involvement of p53 in the growth inhibitory
effect of SLMP53-1 (Figure 2A). Conversely, no
significant differences were observed between the GI50
values of PRIMA-1 in p53+/+ and p53−/− HCT116 cells
(Figure 2A). In our experimental conditions, the GI50 value
of PhiKan083 in HCT116 cells was higher than 150 µM.
The SLMP53-1 growth inhibitory effect
was associated with G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest
(Figure 2B), and apoptosis (Figure 2C) in p53+/+, but

not in p53−/−, HCT116 cells. The enhancement of PARP
cleavage by 16 µM SLMP53-1 in p53+/+, but not in p53−/−,
HCT116 cells further corroborated the activation of a p53dependent apoptotic pathway (Figure 2D).
Consistent with the yeast results, SLMP53-1 also
inhibited the growth of mut p53R280K-expressing
MDA-MB-231 cells with a GI50 value similar to that
obtained in HCT116p53+/+ cells (~16 µM; Figure 2E).

Moreover, it presented a much lower growth inhibitory
activity against mut p53Y220C-expressing HuH-7 cells
(Figure 2E). When compared to PRIMA-1, SLMP53-1
presented a higher potency in MDA-MB-231 cells, but
was less potent against mut p53Y220C-expressing HuH-7
cells (Figure 2E). In our experimental conditions, the GI50
values of PhiKan083 in MDA-MB-231 and HuH-7 cells
were higher than 150 µM.

SLMP53-1 triggers a p53-dependent
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in wt p53- and
mut p53R280K-expressing tumor cells

Interestingly, in MDA-MB-231 cells, despite not
interfering with cell cycle progression (Figure 2F), 16 µM
SLMP53-1 stimulated cell death, as revealed by the
increase of late apoptosis (Figure 2G) and PARP cleavage
(Figure 2H).

In HCT116p53+/+ and MDA-MB-231 cells, 16 µM
SLMP53-1 led to mitochondrial membrane potential
(∆ψm) dissipation and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
generation (Figure 4A). Consistent with p53-dependence,
these effects were not observed in 16 µM SLMP53-1treated HCT116p53−/− cells (Figure 4A). Additionally, in
HCT116p53+/+ (Figure 4B) and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4C)
cells, 16 µM SLMP53-1 triggered BAX, wt p53 (Figure 4B)
and mut p53R280K (Figure 4C) mitochondrial
translocation, and led to cytochrome c (cyt c) release to
cytosol (Figure 4B and 4C). Altogether, these results
showed that SLMP53-1 induced a p53-dependent
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in both wt p53- and mut
p53R280K-expressing tumor cells.

SLMP53-1 selectively activates p53
transcriptional activity and reestablishes mut
p53R280K DNA binding ability
The effect of SLMP53-1 on wt p53 and mut
p53R280K activity was investigated by analysis of the
expression levels of proteins encoded by p53 target genes
in HCT116p53+/+, HCT116p53−/−, and MDA-MB-231 cells.
In HCT116p53+/+ cells, 16 µM SLMP53-1
increased the p53, MDM2, p21, PUMA and BAX
expression levels (Figure 3A). Instead, the levels
of these proteins were not significantly changed in
HCT116p53−/− cells treated with 16 µM SLMP53-1,
supporting the p53-dependent activity of this molecule
(Figure 3A). Additionally, 16 µM SLMP53-1 increased
the mRNA levels of CDKN1A (p21) and TNFRSF10B
(KILLER) in HCT116p53+/+ cells (Figure 3B).
The selective activation of p53 transcriptional activity by
SLMP53-1 was further reinforced by a dual-luciferase
gene reporter assay using p53+/+ and p53−/− HCT116
cells transfected with p21- or MDM2-luciferase reporter
vectors. At 16 µM and 32 µM (2 × GI50), SLMP53-1
increased the expression of the two p53 reporters in
HCT116p53+/+ cells, while no effect was observed in
HCT116p53−/− cells (Figure 3C).
In MDA-MB-231 cells, 16 µM SLMP53-1 increased
MDM2, PUMA and BAX protein levels, with no apparent
increase of p53 protein levels (Figure 3D). The lack of
mut p53 protein stabilization was already reported for
other mut p53 reactivators, and has been attributed to a
reestablishment of the MDM2-mediated p53 degradation
[15]. Moreover, consistent with the lack of effect on cell
cycle progression, 16 µM SLMP53-1 did not affect p21
protein levels (Figure 3D).
The restoration of mut p53R280K DNA binding
ability by SLMP53-1 was assessed by TransAM DNA
binding assay, using MDA-MB-231 cells. The results
revealed a dose-dependent enhancement of the amount of
p53 bound to DNA by SLMP53-1 relative to cells treated
with DMSO only (Figure 3E).
To further demonstrate that the SLMP53-1 effects
were dependent on mut p53R280K in MDA-MB-231 cells,
mut p53R280K was knocked-down by p53siRNA. In cells
transfected with non-specific siRNA (siRNA-NS; control),
16 µM SLMP53-1 increased the protein levels of PUMA,
BAX and cleaved PARP, as observed in non-transfected
cells (Figure 3F). As expected, these SLMP53-1
effects were efficiently abolished by mut p53 silencing
(Figure 3F).

SLMP53-1 inhibits the migration of wt p53- and
mut p53R280K-expressing tumor cells
The results obtained in the wound healing assay showed
that the GI10 concentration (4 µM) of SLMP53-1 reduced
the migration of HCT116p53+/+ and MDA-MB-231 tumor
cells (Figure 5A and 5B). These results were corroborated
by the chemotaxis cell migration assay, in which the GI25
concentration (7 µM) of SLMP53-1 led to over 50%
reduction of HCT116p53+/+ cell migration compared to
DMSO only (Figure 5C). A similar result was obtained with
the constitutively more motile MDA-MB-231 cells treated
with 16 µM SLMP53-1 (Figure 5C). These data showed that
SLMP53-1 inhibited the in vitro migration of both wt p53- and
mut p53R280K-expressing tumor cells.

SLMP53-1 sensitizes wt p53- and mut
p53R280K-expressing tumor cells to conventional
chemotherapeutics in a p53-dependent manner
We investigated whether SLMP53-1 increased the
sensitivity of HCT116p53+/+ and MDA-MB-231 tumor
cells to conventional chemotherapeutics. For that, a low
concentration of SLMP53-1, with no significant growth
inhibitory effects (GI10 of 4 µM), was combined with
increasing concentrations of doxorubicin and etoposide.
In HCT116p53+/+ cells, SLMP53-1 showed synergistic
effects with all tested concentrations of chemotherapeutics
(Q > 1.15), although the most pronounced effects were
obtained with doxorubicin (Figure 6A). Conversely, no
synergistic effects were observed between SLMP53-1 and
the chemotherapeutics in HCT116p53−/− cells (Figure 6B).
As in HCT116p53+/+ cells, synergistic effects between
SLMP53-1 and all tested concentrations of doxorubicin
and etoposide were also observed in MDA-MB-231
cells (Q > 1.15) (Figure 6C). Interestingly, pronounced
synergistic effects between 4 µM SLMP53-1 and the

lowest tested concentrations of doxorubicin (0.19 µM)
and etoposide (0.38 µM) were also evident regarding total
apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells (Q > 1.15; Figure 6D).
Altogether, these results show p53-dependent synergistic
effects of SLMP53-1 with conventional chemotherapeutics.

concerning hematological data, just a small increase on
the reticulocytes number was observed in the vehicle
group compared to saline group, with no alterations
between the SLMP53-1 and vehicle groups. Altogether, no
apparent toxic side effects were observed for SLMP53-1
on the tissues most commonly affected by conventional
chemotherapeutics.
In order to assess the proliferation and apoptotic
status of tumors, immunohistochemistry and TUNEL
staining were performed for tumor tissues (Figure 8).
Both HCT116p53+/+ and MDA-MB-231 tumors, treated
with SLMP53-1, showed low Ki-67-positive staining
(indicative of a low proliferative status), when compared
to tumors treated with vehicle (Figure 8). Additionally, a
marked increase of BAX expression levels in SLMP53-1treated tumor tissues, compared to vehicle, was observed
(Figure 8). In addition, a pronounced increase of nuclei
DNA fragmentation upon SLMP53-1 treatment was
observed (Figure 8). On the other hand, a uniform pattern,
characterized by high levels of Ki-67 and low levels
of BAX expression and DNA fragmentation, between
HCT116p53−/− tumors treated with SLMP53-1 and vehicle
was obtained (Figure 8).

SLMP53-1 has no in vitro toxicity in
non-tumorigenic cells
The potential genotoxicity of SLMP53-1 was
investigated using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus
assay. At 16 µM, SLMP53-1 did not increase the number
of micronuclei in lymphocytes when compared to DMSO
only (Figure 7A). Additionally, 16 µM SLMP53-1
induced only 5.6 ± 3.2% (n = 5) growth inhibition
in non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells, showing that
this concentration is not toxic to normal cells.
Furthermore, unlike in tumor cells, in MCF10A cells,
the growth inhibition induced by SLMP53-1 at GI50
concentration (42.4 ± 2.9 µM, n = 5) was associated with
G0/G1-cell cycle arrest (Figure 7B), but not with apoptosis
(Figure 7C).

SLMP53-1 has potent in vivo antitumor activity
with no evident toxicity

Discussion

To evaluate the in vivo antitumor potential
of SLMP53-1, mice xenograft models carrying
HCT116p53+/+, HCT116p53−/−, or MDA-MB-231
tumor cells were used. The results revealed that four
intraperitoneal administrations (twice a week) of 50 mg/kg
SLMP53-1 were highly effective, blocking the growth of
HCT116p53+/+ tumors (Figure 7D) compared to control
(vehicle). Most importantly, SLMP53-1 had no effect
on HCT116p53−/− tumor xenografts, corroborating its
p53-dependent antitumor activity (Figure 7D). Potent
antitumor activity was also established for MDA-MB-231
tumors, confirming the in vivo efficacy of SLMP53-1
against mut p53R280K-expressing tumors (Figure 7D).
No significant loss of body weight or morbidity signs were
observed in treated mice compared to control, throughout
the experimental period (Figure 7E).
Considering the common chemotherapeutic side
effects, some primary toxicity signs potentially triggered
by SLMP53-1 were investigated in Wistar rats. For
that, the organs relative weight (trophism), as well as
biochemical and hematological data were analyzed
for three rat groups (saline, vehicle and SLMP53-1)
(Supplementary Table 1). No differences between the
three groups on relative weight of liver, kidneys, heart and
lungs were observed. Concerning biochemical data, only
a slight decrease of urea in the vehicle group compared
to saline group, and a slight decrease of uric acid and
albumin in the SLMP53-1 group compared to vehicle
group were observed. Hence, no evident liver or kidney
toxicity was detected in SLMP53-1-treated group. Finally,

From the analysis of a chemical library of novel
enantiopure tryptophanol-derived oxazoloisoindolinones
[16], the small-molecule SLMP53-1 was identified as a
new reactivator of wt p53 and mut p53R280K. Considering
the relevance of the absolute stereochemical configuration
of biologically active compounds, the enantiomer
of SLMP53-1 was also synthesized (Figure 1A).
Interestingly, this enantiomer was inactive in yeast and
exhibited a much lower growth inhibitory effect against
wt/mut p53 bearing tumor cells compared to SLMP53-1
(data not shown). These results highlight the relevance
of the stereochemistry at positions C-3 and C-9b for the
activity of SLMP53-1.

(a DNA contact mutant without major structural
alterations), associated with the absence of effect on
structural mut p53Y220C, lead us to hypothesize some
preference of SLMP53-1 for the wt-like conformation of
p53. Further studies are underway to analyze the activity
of SLMP53-1 on other mut p53s.
Contrary to PRIMA-1, SLMP53-1 showed a
p53-dependent tumor growth inhibitory activity. In fact,
the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and the
enhancement of p53 transcriptional activity by SLMP53-1
in wt p53-expressing HCT116 tumor cells were
completely abolished in p53-null HCT116 cells. In turn,
SLMP53-1 showed a much higher cytotoxicity against
mut p53R280K-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells than
PRIMA-1 (with previously reported cytotoxicity against
this tumor cell line [17]). In these tumor cells, SLMP53-1

restored the wt-like sequence-specific DNA binding ability
to mut p53R280K, with subsequent up-regulation of p53
target genes. Curiously, in mut p53R280K-expressing
cells, the SLMP53-1-induced growth inhibition was only
associated with apoptosis, and not with cell cycle arrest.
These results highlight key genetic differences between
tumor cells associated with distinct p53 status (wt/mut).

The pathophysiological relevance of the
mitochondrial p53 function on apoptotic cell death has
been emphasized in several studies [18]. In response to
stress, a fraction of p53 translocates to mitochondria,
where it binds with Bcl-2 family proteins inducing
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
(MOMP), cyt c release, and subsequent apoptosis [18].

The mitochondrial function of mut p53 is still unclear.
Interestingly, mut p53 has been reported to localize
constitutively at mitochondrial outer membrane due to
its intrinsic cellular stabilization. Despite this, the mut
p53 apoptotic activity is compromised by its inability to
bind to Bcl-2 and trigger MOMP [18, 19]. In this work,
SLMP53-1 triggered a mitochondrial p53 apoptotic
pathway in wt p53-expressing tumor cells, involving ∆ψm
dissipation, p53 and BAX mitochondrial translocation,
as well as cyt c release. Similar events were triggered by
SLMP53-1 in mut p53R280K-expressing tumor cells,
supporting the translocation of a functionally active mut
p53 to mitochondria.
It is interesting to note that SLMP53-1 treatment
induced a p53-dependent ROS generation, which may
result from the stimulation of both pro-oxidant and
mitochondrial p53 functions. Actually, SLMP53-1
enhances the expression of BAX and PUMA, which
besides a connection with the p53 mitochondrial pathway
are also strongly involved in its pro-oxidant function [20].
Collectively, the results obtained indicate that
SLMP53-1 is a “double hit” reactivator of p53-mediated
apoptosis, stimulating both the transcription-dependent
and mitochondrial-mediated p53 functions.
Considered the main cause of morbidity and
mortality in cancer patients, tumor cell invasion and
metastization are central issues in cancer treatment
[21, 22]. The pivotal role of p53 in the prevention of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition and migration is widely
recognized [22]. Accordingly, mut p53 has been associated
to prometastatic functions not only due to the loss of p53
function, but also to the GOF related to p63 inhibition, a
well-known suppressor of tumorigenesis and metastasis
[22]. Low doses of SLMP53-1 potently inhibited the
migration of wt/mut p53-expressing cells, which sustains
the reactivation of wt p53, as well as of mut p53 through
reestablishment of its wt function and possible inhibition
of its GOF.
Drug combination may minimize drug side effects,
while increasing tumor suppressor activity [23]. Since
the majority of conventional chemotherapeutics, as
etoposide and doxorubicin, depend on a functional p53
pathway, combination with p53 reactivators is expected
to enhance their efficacy. Indeed, at low doses, SLMP53-1
showed p53-dependent synergistic effects with both
chemotherapeutic agents in wt/mut p53-expressing
tumor cells. Therefore, combination of SLMP53-1 with
chemotherapeutics revealed great therapeutic potential,
particularly against multidrug-resistant tumor cells, like
triple-negative breast cancers.
The toxicity of standard chemotherapeutics remains
a therapeutically limiting problem. Herein, SLMP53-1
was shown to be non-genotoxic. Additionally, despite
activating wt p53, at the GI50 concentration obtained in
tumor cells, SLMP53-1 was not cytotoxic against wt
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

p53-expressing normal MCF10A cells. The minimal
cytotoxic effects of p53 reactivators on normal cells have
been attributed to their lower susceptibility to apoptotic
stimuli when compared to tumor cells with a constitutive
activation of a DNA damage signaling pathway [24–26].
This leads normal cells to respond to p53 reactivators with
cell cycle arrest (cytostatic effect), instead of cell death
(cytotoxic effect) [27, 28]. Actually, this was observed in
normal cells with SLMP53-1 at 3 × GI50 concentration
used in tumor cells. SLMP53-1 can thus be exploited in
p53-based cyclotherapy, in which normal cells are
protected from the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutics by
induction of cell cycle arrest.
Assays in xenograft mice models reinforced the
p53-dependent in vivo antitumor activity of SLMP53-1.
In fact, SLMP53-1 potently suppressed the growth of
wt p53- and mut p53R280K-expressing tumors through
inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis,
without interfering with the growth of p53-null tumors.
Additionally, SLMP53-1 had no apparent toxic side effects
on tissues most commonly affected by chemotherapy, such
as kidneys, liver and bone marrow.
In conclusion, several evidences are provided in
this work supporting the anticancer therapeutic potential
of SLMP53-1, both alone and combined with conventional
chemotherapeutics. To our knowledge, this is the first
report of a pharmacological reactivator of mut p53R280K.
Besides its potential applicability in cancer therapy,
SLMP53-1 is a starting point for the development of new
effective derivatives targeting mut p53s.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain CG379) was
transformed using the standard lithium acetate method
[8]. For expression of human proteins, cells (routinely
grown in minimal selective medium) were diluted to
0.05 OD600 in induction selective medium containing 2%
(w/w) galactose, 1% (w/w) raffinose, 0.7% (w/w) yeast
nitrogen base without amino acids from Difco, and a
mixture of all the amino acids required for yeast growth
(50 μg/mL) except leucine (for pTS76) or tryptophan
(for pLS89). Cells transformed with the empty vector
(pTS76 or pLS89) were used as control yeast. Yeast
cells were incubated at 30°C under continuous orbital
shaking (200 r.p.m.), in the presence of 0.1 – 50 μM of
compounds or 0.1% DMSO only, for approximately 30 h
(time required by control yeast, incubated with DMSO
only, to achieve 0.4 OD600). In the experiments with PFT-α,
yeast cells expressing wt/mut p53 were incubated with
5 μM PFT-α alone and combined with 10 μM SLMP53-1,
or DMSO only for approximately 30 h. Yeast growth was
analysed by counting the number of colony-forming units
(CFU), after 2 days incubation at 30°C, on Sabouraud
Dextrose Agar from Liofilchem.

Yeast cell cycle analysis
Yeast cell cycle progression was analyzed basically as
described [29]. Briefly, 1 × 107 cells were fixed in 70% (v/v)
ethanol, incubated with 250 µg/mL RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 1 mg/mL Proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by
10 µM Sytox Green Nucleic Acid from Invitrogen and flow
cytometry analysis.

concentrations of doxorubicin (9.38 – 750 nM) or etoposide
(0.38 – 6.00 µM). The effect of combined treatments on
cell growth was analyzed after 48 h incubation, using the
SRB assay, and is expressed by the combination index
(Q), calculated as reported [30], which indicates: Q < 0.85,
antagonism; 0.85 < Q < 1.15 additive effect; Q > 1.15, synergy.

Dual-luciferase reporter assay in human tumor
cell lines
Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed
basically as reported [29, 31]. Briefly, about 5 × 104
cells/well of HCT116 tumor cell line were incubated in
24-well plates for 24 h. Cells were thereafter transfected
at approximately 80% confluence using the Myrus LT-1
reagent, and according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Specifically, 350 ng of the reporter vectors containing
either the p21 (pGL3-1138) or the MDM2 (pGL3-MDM2)
promoter were used along with 50 ng of the control
pRLSV40 plasmid introduced to normalize the transfection
efficiency. After transfection, cells were treated with the
GI50 and 2 × GI50 concentration of SLMP53-1 (or DMSO
only), for 16 h. Cells were harvested, and the luciferase
assay was carried out using the dual-luciferase reagent.
The p53 transcriptional activity is directly proportional
to the luciferase activity (measured by the emitted light
intensity) as described [29].

Analysis of cell cycle and apoptosis in human cell lines
HCT116, MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A cell lines
were incubated in 6-well plates, at a final density of 1.5 × 105
cells/well (for HCT116 cell line) and 2.3 × 105 cells/well (for
MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A cell lines), for 24 h. Cells were
thereafter treated with SLMP53-1 or DMSO only for 24 h. For
cell cycle analysis, cells were stained with propidium iodide
(PI; Sigma-Aldrich) followed by flow cytometric analysis, as
described [30]. For apoptosis analysis, cells were analyzed
by flow cytometry using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis
Detection Kit I from BD Biosciences according to the
manufacturer’s instructions; synergistic effects of combined
treatments between the GI10 concentration of SLMP53-1 (or
DMSO only) and 0.19 µM doxorubicin or 0.38 µM etoposide,
in MDA-MB-231 cell lines, were analyzed (determination of
Q value) as described in the SRB assay.

RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA from tumor cell lines was extracted using
the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). About 1 µg of RNA was used for
cDNA synthesis using M-MuLV reverse transcritptase and
RevertAid cDNA Synthesis kit (ThermoFisher) in 20 μL
final volume, and following manufacturer’s instructions.
qPCR assays were performed in a 384-well plate format
on a CFX Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System
(Bio-rad), starting with 25 ng of cDNA, as previously
described [32]. The 2X KAPA SYBR® FAST qPCR Kit
(Kapa Biosystems) and specific primers, purchased from
Eurofins (MWG), were employed. GAPDH, B2M and
ACTB were used as reference genes.

Western blot analysis
Whole protein extracts (from yeast and human
cells), and mitochondrial/cytosolic fractions from human
cell lines were prepared as described [30]. Western blot
analysis was performed as described [30] using a mouse
monoclonal anti-p53 (DO-1), anti-MDM2 (SMP14),
anti-BAX (2D2), anti-PUMA (B-6), anti-PARP (C2–10),
and anti-cytochrome c (A8) antibodies followed by an
anti-mouse horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibody. For p21 detection, membranes
were probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-p21 (C–19)
antibody, followed by an anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody. For loading control, membranes
were stripped and reprobed with a mouse monoclonal
anti-yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1p) or anti-GAPDH
(6C5) antibodies. For analysis of mitochondrial and
cytosolic fractions, membranes were reprobed with
the loading controls mouse monoclonal anti-COX IV
(F-8) and anti-GAPDH (6C5) antibodies, respectively.
With the exception of anti-Pgk1p (Alfagene), all antibodies

Active Motif, and the protein concentration was measured
using NanoDrop 1000 from Thermo scientific. The p53
DNA binding ability was evaluated using the TransAM p53
Transcription Factor Assay Kit from Active Motif,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
equal amount of total nuclear protein was loaded into a

as kit positive control.

followed by addition of 500 μL medium containing 10%
FBS to the lower chamber. Cells that migrated through
the 8 μm pore membranes were eluted, lysed and stained
with a green-fluorescence dye that binds to cellular nucleic
acids. The number of migrated cells is proportional to the
fluorescence signal measured using the Bio-Tek Synergy
HT plate reader at 480/520 nm (ex/em).

Transfection of p53 siRNA
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with 100 nM
of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against p53
(SMARTpool p53) and negative nonspecific siRNAs
(Non-targeting Pool) from Thermo Scientific/Dharmacon
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following the
manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 h transfection,
cells were treated with GI50 concentration of SLMP53-1
(or DMSO only) for 24 h.

Genotoxicity studies by micronucleus assay
Genotoxicity was analyzed by cytokinesis-block
micronucleus assay in lymphocytes as described [34].
Fresh peripheral blood samples were collected from healthy
volunteers into heparinized vacutainers. Blood samples,
suspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS,
were treated with the GI50 concentration of SLMP53-1,
DMSO only or 1 μg/mL cyclophosphamide (known
mutagenic agent; positive control; Sigma-Aldrich) for 44 h.
Cells were thereafter treated with 3 μg/mL cytochalasin B
(cytokinesis preventive; Sigma-Aldrich) for 28 h.
Lymphocytes were isolated by density gradient separation
(Histopaque-1077 and -1119; Sigma-Aldrich,), fixed in
3:1 methanol/glacial acetic acid, and stained with Wright
stain (Sigma-Aldrich). For each sample, 1000 binucleated
lymphocytes were blindly scored using a Leica light optical
microscope (Wetzlar); the number of micronuclei per 1000
binucleated lymphocytes was recorded.

Analysis of ∆ψm dissipation and ROS generation
Analyses of ∆ψm dissipation and ROS generation
were performed as previously reported [30]. Briefly, about
1.5 × 105 cells/well (for HCT116 cell line) and 2.3 × 105
cells/well (for MDA-MB-231 cell line) were incubated in
6-well plates for 24 h. Cells were thereafter treated with
the GI50 concentration of SLMP53-1 (or DMSO only) for
8 h (for HCT116 cell line) or 16 h (for MDA-MB-231 cell
line) in ∆ψm analysis, and for 24 h in ROS analysis. Then,
cells were stained with 5 μM Cell-ROX Green Reagent
from Life Technologies (in ROS analysis) or with 1 nM
DiOC6(3) from Alfagene (in Δψm analysis) for 30 min at
37ºC; followed by flow cytometry analysis.

In vivo antitumor and toxicity assays
Animal experiments were conducted according to
the European Council Directives on Animal Care and
to the National Authorities. The BALB/c Nude mice
and Wistar rats were purchased from Charles-River
Laboratories and housed under pathogen free conditions
in individual ventilated cages. For toxicity assays, Wistar
rats were treated with 50 mg/kg SLMP53-1, vehicle
(DMSO) or saline solution (control) by intraperitoneal
injection, twice a week during two weeks. After the
four administrations, samples of blood and organs
(kidneys, liver, heart and lungs) were collected for
toxicological analysis. Each group was composed of five
animals. Xenograft tumor assays were performed with
HCT116p53+/+, HCT116p53−/− and MDA-MB-231 human
tumor cell lines. Briefly, 1 × 106 HCT116 cells (in PBS) or
5 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells (in PBS/BD Matrigel Matrix
High Concentration, 1:1; BD Biosciences) were inoculated
subcutaneously in the dorsal flank of each mice. Tumor
dimensions were assessed by caliper measurement
and their volumes were calculated [tumor volume
= (length × width2) / 2]. Treatment was started when
tumors reached volumes of approximately 100 mm3
(which occurred 14 days after the grafts). Mice were
then treated twice a week with 50 mg/kg SLMP53-1 or
vehicle (control) by intraperitoneal injection during two
weeks. Tumor volumes and body weights were monitored

In vitro migration assays
Cell migration was analyzed using the Wound
Healing Scratch assay (as described in [33]) and the QCM
24-Well Fluorimetric Chemotaxis Cell Migration Kit
(8 µm), from Merck Millipore. In the Wound Healing
Scratch assay, about 5 × 105 cells/well of HCT116 p53+/+ and
MDA-MB-231 cell lines were grown to confluence in 6-well
plates for 24 h. Using a sterile 200 μL tip, a fixed-width
wound was created in the cell monolayer and the GI10
concentration of SLMP53-1 (or DMSO only) was
added to medium. Cells were thereafter photographed
using the Moticam 5.0MP camera with Motic’s AE2000
inverted microscope with 400x magnification at different
time-points of treatment until complete closure of the

twice a week until the end of the treatment. Animals were
sacrificed by cervical dislocation at the end of the study.
After sacrifice, tumors were removed and photographed.
Human endpoints were established namely euthanasia
in case of tumors reached 1500mm3, or if the animals
presented any signs of morbidity. The following number of
animals was used: HCT116p53+/+ and HCT116p53−/− cell
lines (Control-6, Treatment-6), MDA-MB-231 (Control-6,
Treatment-6).

Data were analyzed statistically using the GraphPad
software. Differences between means were tested for significance
using the Student’s t-test (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).

Immunohistochemistry
Tumor tissues were fixed in 10% formalin,
embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 µm, and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) or antibodies, following
standard methodologies. Briefly, after deparaffination and
rehydration, antigen retrieval was performed by boiling
the sections for 20 min in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0).
The slices were then held for 20 min at room temperature.
After dewaxing and blocking the endogenous peroxidases
with UltraVision Hydrogen Peroxide Block, sections
were treated with UltraVision Protein Block solution,
both from Lab Vision Thermo Scientific. Incubation with
primary anti-Ki-67 (SP6) and anti-BAX (6A7) antibodies,
from Pierce Thermo Scientific, was performed for 2 h,
at room temperature. Immunostaining was carried out
using the UltraVision Quanto Detection System HRP
DAB kit, from Lab Vision Thermo Scientific, according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Tissue sections were
counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin from Thermo
Scientific, dehydrated, clarified and mounted. The
primary antibody was replaced by 10% non-immune
serum for negative controls. Finally, images were
obtained using the Motic’s AE2000 inverted microscope
(400 × magnification) with the Moticam 5.0 MP camera.
