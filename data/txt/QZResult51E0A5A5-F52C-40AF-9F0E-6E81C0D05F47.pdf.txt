ABSTRACT
The approval of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor AZD2281 in
2014 marked the successful establishment of the therapeutic strategy targeting
homologous recombination repair defects of cancers in the clinic. However, AZD2281
has poor water solubility, low tissue distribution and relatively weak in vivo anticancer
activity, which appears to become limiting factors for its clinical use. In this study, we
found that mefuparib hydrochloride (MPH) was a potent PARP inhibitor, possessing
prominent in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity. Notably, MPH displayed high water
solubility (> 35 mg/ml) and potent PARP1/2 inhibition in a substrate-competitive
manner. It reduced poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) formation, enhanced γH2AX levels,
induced G2/M arrest and subsequent apoptosis in homologous recombination repair
(HR)-deficient cells. Proof-of-concept studies confirmed the MPH-caused synthetic
lethality. MPH showed potent in vitro and in vivo proliferation and growth inhibition
against HR-deficient cancer cells and synergistic sensitization of HR-proficient
xenografts to the anticancer drug temozolomide. A good relationship between the
anticancer activity and the PARP inhibition of MPH suggested that PAR formation
and γH2AX accumulation could serve as its pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Its high
bioavailability (40%~100%) and high tissue distribution in both monkeys and rats
were its most important pharmacokinetic features. Its average concentrations were
33-fold higher in the tissues than in the plasma in rats. Our work supports the further
clinical development of MPH as a novel PARP1/2 inhibitor for cancer therapy.

such instability [2, 3]. It has been shown that germline
defects in 58 of 450 DDR genes are linked to inher­ited
cancer predisposition or to cancer-associated syndromes
[3]. It has been estimated that approximately half of
high-grade serious ovarian cancer harbors homologous

recombination repair (HR) defects that also occur in other
cancers including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancer
[2]. Therefore, targeting DNA-repair defects has been
extensively investigated as an approach for cancer therapy
[3, 4]. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are a
family of enzymes that catalyze the polymerization of
ADP-ribose units from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD+) on target proteins. Among this family, PARP1
and PARP2 are essential to base excision repair (BER)
[5]. Inhibition of PARP has been undoubtedly the focus
of this strategy in recent years [6]. Approval of the
PARP1/2 inhibitor AZD2281 (also known as olaparib) for
the treatment of BRCA-deficient ovarian cancer in 2014
marked the successful establishment of such a therapeutic
strategy for cancer in the clinic [3].
However, although the current PARP inhibitors,
including the approved one (AZD2281; also known
as olaparib) and those at late-stage clinical trials, i.e.,
rucaparib (AG-014699), veliparib (ABT-888), niraparib
(MK4827) and talazoparib (BMN673), can elicit potent
PARP inhibition, particularly at molecular levels, all of
them have very low water solubility (< 1 mg/ml) [7]. This
feature might be unfavorable for making their formulations
and for their absorption and distribution in the human
body. As an example, the solubility of AZD2281 is
only 0.1 mg/ml in aqueous media that is independent of
pH [8]. Its licensed capsule formulation (50 mg) contains
a relatively high proportion of surfactants, needs to be
stored strictly at 15~30°C and even at this condition
has a relatively short shelf-life of 1.5 years. Moreover,
patients need to take 16 capsules each day (400 mg bid).
AZD2281 has an average Vd of 40.3 L in humans [9],
1.18 L/kg in rats and 1.3 L/kg in dogs [10], indicating
that tissues, especially its potentially-targeted tissues, has
comparatively low drug exposure and concentrations.
Moreover, AZD2281 is hard to go through the bloodbrain barrier [9] and is a substrate of the drug transporter
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) [11], further limiting its uses in
some tumors, such as malignant glioma (a high proportion
of which harbors HR defects due to PTEN mutations)
and P-gp-overexpressed tumors. These characteristics of
AZD2281 are not conducive to its clinical uses and are
likely to restrict its therapeutic effectiveness.
Therefore, improving pharmaceutical properties such
as water solubility of candidate drugs with sufficiently
potent capability to inhibit PARP will be an important
strategy for the development of new PARP inhibitors.
Based on this consideration, huge efforts were made
[12,  13] and finally, mefuparib hydrochloride (MPH;
Figure 1A), a new potent, PARP 1/2 inhibitor with high
water-solubility was obtained. Its preclinical study has been
completed and its clinical trials will be conducted soon.
Here we present the major preclinical
pharmacological results of MPH with special attention
to its pharmacokinetics (PK)-pharmacodynamics (PD)
relationships. MPH has excellent water solubility
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(> 35 mg/ml, 350-fold higher than that of AZD2281) and
can be made into common tablet formulations. We show
its PARP1/2 inhibition, selectivity, anticancer activity and
PD biomarkers in both in vitro and in vivo models. We also
report its PK characteristics including metabolic species
differences, major PK parameters and tissue distribution,
favorably supporting its potential therapeutic uses.

RESULTS
MPH is a potent inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2
MPH has a novel chemical structure designed
by using benzofuran as a core structure via a privileged
structure strategy and adopting an intramolecular hydrogen
bond (pseudo bicyclic ring) instead of a fused amide bond.
MPH has excellent water solubility (> 35 mg/ml) and
stability (no detectable changes for more than 2 years at
room temperature). MPH showed potent inhibition against
PARP1 [IC50: 35.89 nM (Figure 1B; ELISA assays) or
3.2 nM (Supplementary Table S1; biotinylated NAD+based assays)] and PARP2 [IC50: 1.9 nM (Supplementary
Table S1)]. It revealed high selectivity of PARP1/2, more
than 406 fold over other major nuclear PARPs including
PARP3, TNKS1, TNKS2 and PARP6 (Supplementary
Table S1). Though MPH inhibited PARP1/2 about 2~4-fold
less potently than the approved inhibitor AZD2281, it
displayed much higher selectivity of PARP1/2 over the
other examined PARP family members (Figure 1B; and
Supplementary Table S1).
Mechanistic studies indicated that MPH inhibited
the catalytic activity of PARP1 in a substrate (NAD+)competitive manner (Figure 1C) and thus reduced the
formation of the resulting PAR (Figure 1D). Chinese
hamster V-C8 cells have an impaired capacity of the HR
pathway due to a deficiency in BRCA2 [21–23]. Relative
to wild-type V79 cells, V-C8 cells are extremely sensitive
to PARP inhibitor [22]. Furthermore, the treatments with
MPH, just as with AZD2281, caused the accumulation
of DSB marked by the increased levels of γH2AX in the
BRCA-deficient V-C8 (BRCA2−/−) and MDA-MB-436
(BRCA1−/−) cells in a concentration-dependent manner, but
not in the BRCA-proficient V79 cells (Figure 1E). When
exposed to gradient concentrations of MPH, consequently,
V-C8 cells but not V79 cells came into typical G2/M arrest
(Figure 1F) and subsequent apoptosis (Figure 1G).
All these data collectively indicate that MPH is a
potent inhibitor of PARP1/2 with excellent structural
novelty and water solubility.

MPH elicits selective killing in HR-deficient cells
both in vitro and in vivo: a proof of concept
PARP1/2 inhibition causes synthetic lethality in HRdeficient cells [22]. To further conduct proof-of-concept
studies with MPH, we used a well-characterized isogenic

system consisting of Chinese hamster lung fibroblast
cells: V-C8 (BRCA2−/−), V79 (wild-type) and V-C8+H13
(BRCA2 genetically complemented with the 13th
chromosome) cells [23]. In vitro assays showed that MPH
elicited cell killing in V-C8 46.85- and 97.56-fold more
potently than in V79 and V-C8+H13 cells, respectively.
By contrast, AZD2281 caused 25.64- and 22.31-fold more
potent cell killing in the BRCA2−/− cells than in V79 and
V-C8+H13 cells, respectively, indicating that MPH has
higher selectivity than AZD2281 in this case (Table 1). In
nude mice subcutaneous xenograft models, consistently,
MPH displayed dose- and time-dependent killing on V-C8
xenografts accompanied by complete disappearance of
some xenografts, especially in the high-dose group. The
positive control AZD2281 revealed similar killing, and
its effect at 100 mg/kg each day was between those of
MPH at 80 mg/kg and 180 mg/kg every other day. At all
the tested doses, MPH or AZD2281 did not cause death
or significant body-weight loss of the animals during the
experiment (Figure 2A). In sharp contrast, the similar
treatments with MPH or AZD2281 did not inhibit the
growth of V79 xenografts (Figure 2B). The data prove
the concept that MPH can cause the synthetic lethality
selectively in HR-deficient cells.
To clarify whether the anticancer activity of MPH
is dependent on its PARP1 inhibition, we constructed a
PARP1-deficient cell line using the transcription activatorlike effector nuclease technique (TALEN) technique in
Ewing sarcoma RD-ES cells (Supplementary Figure S1A).
As expected, the knockout of PARP1 impaired the cellular
sensitivity to MPH. The IC50 value of MPH increased 5-7
fold in the PARP1-deficient RD-ES cells when compared
with that in the corresponding wild-type cells and the
similar changes were seen with AZD2281 (Supplementary
Figure S1B). Our data indicated that MPH inhibits the
growth of HR-deficient cancer dependent on its PARP
inhibition activity.

30 mg/kg each day was between those of MPH at 40 mg/kg
and 80 mg/kg every other day (Figure 2C). The results
indicate that MPH possesses the potential to kill human
HR-deficient cancers. We further evaluated the potentiated
efficacy of MPH on DNA damaging agent temozolomide
(TMZ) in vivo. MPH alone even at 160 mg/kg every other
day did almost not affect the growth of HR-proficient
SW620 xenografts in nude mice. When combined,
it potentiated the growth-inhibitory effects of TMZ
(2 mg/kg) (Figure 2D). Specifically, the combination
groups of 160 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg revealed more than
1 of combination ratios (2.8 and 2.0, respectively)
(Supplementary Table S2), indicating that MPH is
synergistic with TMZ in their in vivo anticancer activities.
To further evaluate the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy
of MPH, a subcutaneous BR-05-0028 breast patientderived xenograft (PDX) model was used to test the
treatment regimen of MPH as a single agent (BR-05-0028
with BRCA1 mutated at exon10:c.C1630T:p.Q544X;
established and kept by WuXi AppTec, Shanghai, China).
When given at 160 mg/kg once every other day, MPH
inhibited the growth of the PDX without obvious loss of
body weight (Figure 3A–3C).
Together, those data reveal the anticancer potential
of MPH alone or in combination.

MPH suppresses PAR formation in HR-deficient
Capan-1 cells and MDA-MB- 436 xenografts:
Pharmacodynamic analyses
In the nucleus, the majority of PAR formation
is catalyzed by PARP1/2 [25]. We have shown above
that MPH is a PARP1/2 inhibitor, displaying its in vitro
and in vivo anticancer activity. To further confirm the
PARP1/2 target engagement following the exposure
of MPH, we conducted pharmacodynamic analyses at
cellular and xenograft levels. The exposure of BRCA2deficient pancreatic cancer Capan-1 cells to the DNA
damaging agent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced large
amounts of PAR formation in the cells (the upper left
panel, Figure 4A). Pretreatments with MPH inhibited
the H2O2-induced PAR formation in a concentrationdependent manner with an average IC50 of 69.87 nM, and
when at concentrations > 1 µM, MPH could completely
prevent the formation of PAR (the upper right panel and
the lower panel, Figure 4A). The data indicate that MPH
could inhibit the catalytic activity of its molecular targets
PARP1/2 in the cellular system. This conclusion is further
strengthened by its direct inhibition on PAR formation in
the cell-free system (Figure 1D) and its induction of DSB
accumulation in HR-deficient V-C8 and MDA-MB-436
cells (Figure 1E).
To do the in vivo pharmacodynamic analyses, we
determined the concentrations of MPH in the plasma and
MDA-MB-436 xenografts in nude mice at different times
post oral administration of MPH at 40, 80 or 160 mg/kg

MPH inhibits growth and proliferation of HRdeficient cancer cells and sensitizes HR-proficient
cancer cells to anticancer drugs
We then examined the ability of MPH to suppress
growth and proliferation of 11 cancer cell lines harboring
well-characterized different deficiencies in the HR
pathways, including BRCA1−/−, BRCA2−/−, PTEN−/− and
EWS-FLI1 [24] (Table 1). MPH exerted potent in vitro
proliferation-inhibitory effects on these cancer cells
derived from different human tissues with an average
IC50 of 2.16 µM (0.12 µM ~ 3.64 µM), which is 2.58-fold
more potent than AZD2281 (Table 1). Similarly, in the
in vivo MDA-MB-436 (BRCA1−/−) xenograft model, MPH
significantly inhibited the growth of the xenografts in doseand time-dependent manners with complete disappearance
of 1/2 xenografts in the high-dose group. In the same
model, the effect of the positive control AZD2281 at

(Figure 4B). The doses were the same as those used to test
its in vivo anticancer activity (Figure 2). Its concentrations
were shown to have good dose- and time-dependency.
The concentrations in the plasma rapidly reached the peak
following the MPH administration (Tmax: 0.5~2 h) but later
in the xenografts (Tmax: 3~6 h). However, the exposure of
MPH in the xenografts was above 20-fold higher than
that in the plasma in each dose group (Supplementary
Table S3). Consistently, at the same time-point and the
same dose, the concentrations in the xenografts were
higher than those in the plasma (Figure 4B). At 0.5 h,
the concentrations of MPH in the groups of 40, 80 and
160 mg/kg were 1274, 1626 and 3939 ng/ml in the
plasma and 7740, 9667 and 21786 ng/g in the xenografts,
respectively. They were approximately equivalent to
3.78, 4.83 and 11.70 µM in the plasma and 22.98, 28.70
and 64.69 µM in the xenografts. In contrast, at 2 h, its
concentrations were 1058 (3.14), 1655 (4.91) and 2686
(7.98) ng/ml (µM) in the plasma and 13242 (39.32), 21457
(63.71) and 39139 (116.21) ng/g (µM) in the xenografts,
respectively (Figure 4B). Therefore, at these two time
points, all the determined concentrations of MPH were
higher than that at which MPH could inhibit PARP1/2.
We thus evaluated PARP inhibition at 0.5 and 2 h
following MPH administration in the low (40 mg/kg)
and high (160 mg/kg) -dose groups by functional assays
for PAR formation in peripheral-blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) and MDA-MB-436 xenograft tumor cells
in nude mice. In both PBMC and xenograft tumor cells,
MPH resulted in rapid and dramatic inhibition of PARP,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

as shown by more than 90% reduction at 0.5 h and
almost complete disappearance of PAR formation at
2 h (Figure 4C and 4D). Consistently, in the BRCA1deficient MDA-MB-436 xenograft tumor cells, the levels
of γH2AX, a DSB marker, increased in time- and dosedependent manners (Figure 4E). The results indicate that
at the in vivo experimental doses, MPH could rapidly
reach the effective therapeutic concentrations and lead to
significant PARP inhibition, which is quickly coupled with
downstream induction of DSB in xenografts.

Pharmacokinetic characteristics of MPH in
animals
To choose proper animals to investigate the in vivo
pharmacokinetic characteristics of MPH, we compared
its metabolic stability and its metabolite profile in liver
microsomes from different species of animals, including
mouse, rat, dog and monkey with those in human liver
microsomes. The data showed that MPH was the stablest
in the monkey liver microsomes with a remaining
amount of about 90% and the most instable in the dog
liver microsomes with nearly no remaining amount
after 60-min incubation. In human, rat and mouse liver
microsomes, MPH following 60-min incubation remained
78.5%, 46.3% and 63.6%, respectively (Figure 5A). This
phenomenon was further reflected in its metabolite profile:
after the same-time incubation in liver microsomes, its
metabolites increased by the order of monkey, human,
mouse, rat and dog although their metabolite spectrums

these data, we selected rat and monkey to the subsequent
pharmacokinetic studies.
Following its single-dose oral administration
of different doses in both rat and monkey (Figure 5C;

Supplementary Table S4), MPH was rapidly absorbed with
average plasma Tmax of 2~4 h. The plasma concentrations
and exposure increased over the increasing doses.
Importantly, the plasma Cmax in both animals at the doses of
20 mg/kg or above was higher than 1 μM, a concentration

at which MPH could almost completely inhibit the
catalytic activity of PARP1/2 (Figure 4A). MPH had high
bioavailability (above 40%) (Supplementary Table S4, S5)
and seemed to increase over the increasing doses, possibly
because its metabolism was saturated at higher doses.
MPH displayed a longer average t1/2 in monkeys (2.5 h)
than in rats (1.2 h) and its plasma concentrations could
not be detected after 24 h in monkeys but within 12 h
in rats, indicating its slower elimination in the former
(Figure 5A and 5B).
In rats after being given 20 mg/kg orally, MPH
was extensively distributed to all the 18 detected
tissues, in which its concentrations were average-33fold higher than that in the plasma at the 3 h -time point
post its administration (Figure 5D). Among these tissues
compared with the plasma at 3 h, lung got the highest
MPH concentration (188-fold) and the fat tissue had the
lowest (7-fold); the concentration of MPH in the brain also
reached a high level of 10-fold, indicating that MPH easily
enters into the brain tissue through the blood-brain barrier.
Notably, the tissues corresponding to those in human,
from which cancers harboring HR-deficiency have been
reported, including ovary, pancreas, colon and uterus, also
had high MPH distribution, higher than that in the plasma
by 35, 33, 18, and 19 times, respectively (Figure 5D).
MPH had its Tmax of 3 h post its administration, and then
reduced over the time, with average concentrations of
28%, 8% and lower than 1% of its Cmax at 6-h, 8-h and
24-h time points, respectively.

Following its oral administration at 10 mg/kg
in monkeys, 6 metabolites of MPH could be detected
(Figure 5E). M1 and M2, which were respectively
generated via amide hydrolysis and oxidative deamination
of MPH, were its 2 major direct metabolites, accounting
for 52.18% and 1.86% of the total amount of all the
metabolites and MPH itself in the plasma at the 3-h time
point. M3 (a secondary metabolite of M1 via glucuronate
conjugation) to M6 accounted for 4.18%, 0.24%, 0.72%
and 1.63% at the same time point, respectively. At the
12-h time-point post the MPH administration, only MPH
itself, M1 and M2 could be detectable in the plasma, with
average remaining amounts of 6.79%, 3.13% and 23.54%
of their corresponding plasma amount at 3 h, respectively.
MPH that was not metabolized and its metabolites were
basically excreted via feces and urine.
The above data show that MPH possesses good
pharmacokinetic characteristics in animals, and especially
its high distribution in the potentially therapeuticallytargeted tissues greatly favors the treatment of
HR-deficient cancers with MPH.

DISCUSSION
We here present MPH as a novel PARP1/2 inhibitor
with good pharmacokinetic characteristics. MPH has
a novel chemical structure consisting of a privileged
structure benzofuran carrying an intramolecular hydrogen
bond to keep a pseudo bicyclic pharmacophore. MPH

possesses high stability and appropriate lipophilicity, and
the salification with hydrochloride confers its high water
solubility. These features offer its high bioavailability and
facilitate to make its formulations for uses in humans,
which confer prominent advantages upon MPH especially
in considering the related problems of the majority of
PARP inhibitors currently approved or under late-stage
clinical trials arising from their poor water solubility.
MPH displays potent PARP1/2 inhibition, which
can be effectively translated into its biological effects
including reducing in vitro and in vivo PAR formation,
and inducing DSB (marked by γH2AX) accumulation and
subsequently causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in
HR-deficient (e.g., V-C8 and MDA-MB-436) rather than
HR-proficient (e.g., V79) cells. Although at molecular
levels, MPH inhibits PARP1/2 2-4-fold less potently than
the approved PARP inhibitor AZD2281, it causes 2.58-fold
more potent in vitro proliferative inhibition than the latter
in HR-deficient cancer cells and approximately equipotent
in vivo growth inhibition in HR-deficient xenografts. This
difference possibly arises from better solubility and higher
permeability of MPH. The difference is further supported
by the fact that oral administration of MPH yields higher
concentrations and greater exposure (more than 20-fold)
in the xenografts than in the plasma in MDA-MB-436
xenograft models. At this condition, PARP1/2 in PBMC
and tumor cells in the xenografts can be inhibited nearly
totally and DSB accumulation progressively increases in
tumor cells in the xenografts, which forms the basis of the
in vivo anticancer activity of MPH.
MPH shows better selectivity at either molecular
or cellular levels than AZD2281. This selectivity can be
further turned into single-agent growth inhibition of MPH
in the HR-deficient xenografts (e.g., V-C8 and MDAMB-436) but not in the HR-proficient xenografts (e.g.,
V79 and SW620). Additionally, MPH in combination with
TMZ elicits synergistic growth inhibition on HR-proficient
SW620 xenografts in nude mice. In fact, the synergism of
MPH with TMZ is similar to that of other PARP inhibitors
under clinical trials [11]. All the results suggest that MPH
has the potential to exert more selective anticancer effects
than AZD2281 in the clinic.
MPH also shows prominent advantages in its
pharmacokinetics. MPH can be absorbed nearly completely
with high bioavailability (40%~100%). Its distribution is
very wide and in rats, its average concentrations in the
tissues can be 33-fold higher than those in the plasma.
Especially importantly, the potential tissues therapeutically
targeted by MPH including ovary, pancreas, colon and
uterus also have much greater concentrations than the
plasma. Relatively slow metabolism in monkeys that
have the most similar metabolic characteristics to humans
also favors cancer therapy with MPH. Therefore, these
pharmacokinetic features lay an excellent basis for the
therapeutic uses of MPH in humans.
Collectively, MPH is a new PARP1/2 inhibitor with
high water solubility and structurally different from all the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PARP inhibitors approved and in clinical trials. Its potent
PARP1/2 inhibition can be effectively translated into its
selective killing on HR-deficient cancers and synergistic
sensitization of HR-proficient cancers to anticancer drugs.
Its excellent solubility facilitates to make its formulations
and favors its oral absorption. Its high distribution in
tissues and especially in those potentially targeted tissues
further supports its potential anticancer uses. Together, our
results indicate that MPH is promising in its future clinical
development.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Synthesis and purification of MPH
Mefuparib
employed
privileged
structure
benzofuran as the scaffold and utilized an intramolecular
hydrogen bond to mimic the fused amide bond as
the bioactive pharmacophore [14]. The free base of
mefuparib (5-fluoro-2-(4-((methylamino) methyl)phenyl)
benzofuran-7-carboxamide; Figure1A) was synthesized
from methyl 5-fluoro-3-iodosalicylate and 1-(4-ethynyl)N-methylmethanamine in two steps. Methyl 5-fluoro-2-(4((methylamino)methyl)phenyl)benzofuran-7-carboxylate
was prepared by a cascade reaction in the presence of
Pd(PPh3)2Cl2/CuI and then ammonolyzed with ammonia
methanol solution to give the target compound [15].
The free base was converted to monohydrochloride in
ethanol with concentrated hydrochloric acid and then
recrystallized to give the pure product MPH (> 98.4%,
HPLC). MPH has high water solubility (> 35 mg/mL)
and appropriate lipophilicity (ClogP 2.99). Details of the
design and structure-activity relationships for MPH and its
analogs will be reported elsewhere soon.

Drugs, reagents and antibodies
AZD2281 was purchased from LC Laboratories
(Woburn, MA). Temozolomide (TMZ) was from Jiang
Su Tasly Diyi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (Huaian, Jiangsu,
China). The drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and stored at –20 °C. Z-VAD.fmk, JC-1, RNase
and propidium iodide (PI) were from Beyotime Institute
of Biotechnology (Haimen, Zhejiang, China). All other
chemical reagents were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
Antibodies against β-actin and caspase-3 were from
Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and antibodies
against PAR, γH2AX and histone H3 came from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Cell culture
Chinese hamster cell lines V-C8, V79 and
V-C8+H13 were gifts from Prof M Zdzienicka (Leiden
University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Human
glioblastoma cell lines U-87 MG and U251 were
purchased from the Shanghai Institutes for Biological
4165

Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. All other
cell lines were from the American Type Culture Collection.
The cells were periodically authenticated by morphologic
inspection and tested for Mycoplasma contamination. The
cells were cultured according to the suppliers’ instructions.

mice, respectively. After 1~2 passages in nude mice, the
well-grown xenografts were cut into 1.5-mm3 fragments
that subsequently were transplanted s.c. into the right
flank of nude mice. When xenografts reached a volume
of 100–200 mm3 (230-240 mm3 for V79), the mice were
randomized to control and treated groups and received
the corresponding treatments as indicated. The doses and
the administration time interval of MPH were determined
according to its preliminary experimental results that
showed more potent growth inhibition of MPH in the
V-C8 xenograft models when the same total dosing
amount of MPH was orally administrated once every
other day rather than once each day. The size of xenografts
and the body weight of mice were measured individually
twice per week. The xenografts were measured for the
maximal width (X) and length (Y) and the volume (V)
was calculated as (X2Y)/2. Relative tumor volume (RTV)
was calculated as Vt / V0, where V0 and Vt were the volume
before and after treatments, respectively. The in vivo
anticancer activity was judged by their T/C (%) values.
T/C (%) was calculated as (TRTV / CRTV)×100%, where TRTV
and CRTV represented the RTV of the treatment and the
vehicle group, respectively.
The anticancer activity of MPH against patientderived xenografts (PDX) was determined by WuXi
AppTec (Shanghai, China). The human breast PDX BR05-0028, containing a BRCA1 gene mutation [BRCA1
(NM 007294): exon10 C1630T (Q544X)]. When the
xenografts grew to approximately 150 mm3, the animals
were randomized into various groups and treated as
indicated.
The experiments abided by institutional ethical
guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee in our
institute.

PARP inhibition assays in cell-free systems
The inhibition of the tested compounds on PARP1
enzymatic activity in a cell-free system was determined
by ELISA as reported previously [13]. A similar assay in
which NAD+ was used at gradient concentrations was done
to analyze whether MPH inhibited PARP1 in a substrate
(NAD+)-competitive manner. And a similar but amplified
100-ml reaction system containing 100 μg/ml PARP1,
800 μM NAD+, 30 μg/ml DNA and 1 mg/ml histone was
used to detect the inhibition of PAR formation by the
standard Western blotting. The selective inhibition of
the tested drugs on the PARP family members including
PARP1, PARP2, PARP3, TNKS1, TNKS2 and PARP6
was measured by biotinylated NAD+-based luminescence
assays by BPS Bioscience (San Diego, CA).

Assays for γH2AX accumulation in cultured cells
γH2AX accumulation in the cells exposed to MPH
or AZD2281 was assayed by immunofluorescence-based
laser confocal microscopy or Western blotting as described
previously [16].

Flow cytometry
V-C8 and V79 cells following treatments with MPH
for 24 h (for cell cycle arrest) or 48 h (for apoptosis) were
analyzed by PI-staining-based (for cell cycle arrest) or
AnnexinV-FITC and PI-staining-based (for apoptosis)
flow cytometry as described previously [16, 17].

In vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic studies
In the in vitro pharmacodynamic assay, brca2deficient Capan-1 cells were grown on 96-well black
microplates at the density of 104 cells/well. The cells were
pretreated with MPH and treated with H2O2 as indicated
and then analyzed for the intracellular PAR formation at an
IN Cell Analyzer 2000 (GE Healthcare) just as described
previously [13].
The in vivo pharmacodynamic assay was conducted
by using a brca1-deficient MDA-MB-436 xenografts
model in nude mice as described above. After the singledose oral administration of MPH, the blood and xenografts
of mice were taken for determining the concentrations of
MPH and the levels of PAR formation and/or γH2AX
accumulation at the indicated time points. The liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) was used to measure the concentrations of
MPH in the plasma and xenografts of mice. The levels
of PAR formation in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) and tumor cells in the xenografts were evaluated
by using the similar protocols as reported previously and

Proliferative inhibition assays
Cells cultured in 96-well plates were treated
with PARP inhibitors alone or in combination with the
indicated anticancer drugs for 3 days (Chinese hamster
cells and Ewing sarcoma cells) or 7 days (all the other
cells). Then the cells were subjected to the Cell Counting
Kit 8 (CCK8) assays (Chinese hamster cells, Ewing
sarcoma cells, HCC1937 and MDA-MB-436 cells) or
by Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays (all the other cells)
as described previously [18, 19]. The inhibition rate (%)
was calculated as: [1-(A450treated/A450control)] × 100%. The
averaged IC50 values (mean ± SD) were determined with
the Logit method from three independent tests.

In vivo anticancer activity experiments
V-C8, V79, MDA-MB-436 and SW620 xenografts
were established by inoculating 5 × 106 cells s.c. in nude

present [9]. The levels of γH2AX accumulation in tumor
cells in the xenografts were determined by Western
blotting and β-actin was used as the internal control.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Pharmacokinetic studies

No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.

The metabolic stability and metabolite profiles of
MPH were analyzed by using liver microsomes of different
species (BD Gentest, Woburn, MA) as indicated. Assays
were conducted in a 100-µl volume containing 100 mM
potassium phosphate buffer (PBS, pH7.4), 0.5 mg/ml liver
microsomal protein (the corresponding inactivated liver
microsomal protein was used in the control group), 3.0 µM
MPH and 1.0 mM NADPH. Following the incubation at
37°C for the indicated time (for the metabolic stability
analysis) or 60 min (for the metabolite profile analysis),
reactions were terminated by addition of 100 µl icecold acetonitrile. LC-MS/MS was used to measure the
remaining MPH in the metabolic stability analysis while
UPLC-UV/Q-TOF MS was used to identify the metabolite
profile of MPH as described previously [20].
SD rats and cynomolgus monkeys were used to
do the in vivo pharmacokinetic studies. Following MPH
administration, blood and tissues were collected at the
indicated time and analyzed for the MPH concentration
by LC-MS/MS. The plasma MPH concentration-time
data were analyzed with the noncompartmental method
(Phoenix, version 1.3; Pharsight, Mountain View, CA) to
derive pharmacokinetic parameters. The metabolites in the
monkey plasma were analyzed by UPLC-UV/Q-TOF MS.
The metabolite data were collected with Analyst® TF V1.6
(AB Sciex Inc., Framingham, MA) and Masslynx V4.1
(Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) and analyzed with
PeakView® V1.2 and MetabolitePilot V1.5 (AB Sciex).
