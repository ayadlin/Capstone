ABSTRACT
One of the signaling components involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
progression is the focal adhesion adaptor paxillin. Hydrogen peroxide inducible
clone-5 (Hic-5), one of the paralogs of paxillin, exhibits many biological functions
distinct from paxillin, but may cooperate with paxillin to trigger tumor progression.
Screening of Hic-5 in 145 surgical HCCs demonstrated overexpression of Hic-5
correlated well with intra- and extra-hepatic metastasis. Hic-5 highly expressed in
the patient derived HCCs with high motility such as HCC329 and HCC353 but not in
the HCCs with low motility such as HCC340. Blockade of Hic-5 expression prevented
constitutive migration of HCC329 and HCC353 and HGF-induced cell migration of
HCC340. HCC329Hic-5(-), HCC353Hic-5(-), HCC372Hic-5(-), the HCCs stably depleted
of Hic-5, exhibited reduced motility compared with each HCC expressing Scramble
shRNA. Moreover, intra/extrahepatic metastasis of HCC329Hic-5(-) in SCID mice
greatly decreased compared with HCC329Scramble. On the other hand, ectopic Hic-5
expression in HCC340 promoted its progression. Constitutive and HGF-induced Hic-5
expression in HCCs were suppressed by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers
catalase and dithiotheritol and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125. On
the contrary, depletion of Hic-5 blocked constitutive and HGF-induced ROS generation
and JNK phosphorylation in HCCs. Also, ectopic expression of Hic-5 enhanced ROS
generation and JNK phosphorylation. These highlighted that Hic-5 plays a central
role in the positive feedback ROS-JNK signal cascade. Finally, the Chinese herbal
derived anti-HCC peptide LZ-8 suppressed constitutive Hic-5 expression and JNK
phosphorylation. In conclusion, Hic-5 mediates ROS-JNK signaling and may serve as
a therapeutic target for prevention of HCC progression.

by intrahepatic metastasis (about 80%) or extrahepatic
metastasis (about 20%) [1]. Therefore, prevention of
metastasis is essential for HCC management. To address
the issue, the suitable targets within the molecular pathways
leading to HCC metastasis are needed to be identified.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
common deadly cancers worldwide. The poor prognosis
of HCC is due to high recurrence rate mainly caused

The tumor microenvironment of HCC contains a lot
of metastatic factors including transforming growth factor
β (TGFβ) [2] and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) [3, 4],
which are capable of triggering HCC metastasis. Paxillin,
one of the adaptor molecules critical for integrating the focal
adhesion signaling [5–7], is known to be involved in HCC
progression triggered by HGF [8, 9], integrin engagement
[10] or overexpression of P21-activated protein kinase [11].
Within the paxillin superfamily, Hic-5 is the most
homologous to paxillin, with minor differences in the
number of N-terminal LD domains [5]. However, many
biochemical properties, regulatory mechanisms and
molecular functions of Hic-5 are rather different from those
of paxillin [12]. Upon integrin engagement or growth factor
stimulation, paxillin becomes phosphorylated, primarily
on Tyr 31 and 118 [5, 6] or Ser 178 [13], mediating signal
transductions for cell spreading and motility. Although there
are tyrosine phosphorylation sites on Hic-5 such as Y38,
Y60 between LD1 and LD2 domain [for review 12, 33], the
aforementioned phosphorylating events of paxillin (at Y31,
118) do not occur on Hic-5, due to the lack of cognate
tyrosine/Ser residues. On the other hand, expression of Hic5 but not paxillin can be stimulated by TGFβ [14] or ROS
[15], required for its biological activation. In spite of these
discrepancies, Hic-5 was also capable of triggering tumor
progression as paxillin, although via distinct molecular
pathways [16]. Moreover, Hic-5 may cooperate with paxillin
to regulate metastasis of breast cancer [17]. However, the
role of Hic-5 in HCC has not been clarified thus far.
In this study, we found Hic-5 could be a potential
prognosis maker and therapeutic target for prevention
of HCC. On the signaling level, Hic-5 mediates the
sustained ROS-JNK signaling required for triggering HCC
progression.

dramatic elevation of Hic-5 in most of the HCCs with
positive PXN(p-Y31) (Supplementary Figure S1, lower
panel). To ascertain that the cross-reacted band was indeed
Hic-5 but not other proteins related to paxillin, we further
screened the expression of Hic-5 compared with leupaxin,
another member of paxilin family with molecular weight
slightly lower than 50 kD [5], in more HCC samples. As
demonstrated in the Western blot of Hic-5 (Figure 1A upper
panel), overexpression of Hic-5 (50 kD) can be observed in
6 HCCs but not the normal counterparts, whereas no band
can be clearly observed in the same HCCs by Western blot
of leupaxin (Figure 1A lower panel). Further, by screening
145 HCCs we found PXN(p-Y31) and Hic-5 increased in
about 40.7% and 48.3% tissues respectively. Moreover,
about 34.5% HCC tissues exhibited simultaneous elevation
of both proteins (Supplementary Figure S2). Whether Hic-5
indeed expressed within the HCCs was examined in situ. As
demonstrated in Figure 1B, IHC of Hic-5 on tissue sections
of two Hic-5 overexpressing HCCs, denoted as HCC-Hic-5
I and HCC-Hic-5 II, revealed that Hic-5 was distributed
within the tumor (but not non-tumor) region as indicated
by hematoxylin/Eosin (H.E.) stain on the parallel tissue
sections. In contrast, IHC using IgG as control revealed
negative staining in the same region.
Further, the correlations of increased expression
of Hic-5 and PXN(p-Y31) with metastatic potential of
HCCs were analyzed. As shown in Table 1, 83.3%, 100%
and 84.2% of HCCs with positive intrahepatic metastasis
(I.M.), extrahepatic metastasis (E.M.) and total metastasis
(T.M.), respectively, exhibited higher expression of
Hic-5. In contrast, Hic-5 was higher in only 43.3%, 46%
and 42.9% of HCCs with negative I.M., E.M. and T.M,
respectively. Statistical analysis revealed that high Hic-5
expression in HCCs correlated well with I.M. (p = 0.001),
E.M. (p = 0.01) and T.M. (p = 0.001) (Chi-square test,
SPSS 16.0, N = 145) (Table 1). Also, the association of
high Hic-5 with E.M. was confirmed by Fisher’s Exact test
(p = 0.011) (Table 1). In comparison, the correlations of
PXN(p-Y31) with I.M. (p = 0.004) and T.M. (p = 0.008)
were slightly poor than those of Hic-5 (Chi-square test,
SPSS 16.0, N = 145) (Table 2). In addition, the correlations
of PXN(p-Y31) with E.M. was insignificant (p = 0.186).

RESULTS
Detection of Hic-5 as a HCC progression marker
Initially, we investigated whether Tyr31 phosphory­
lated paxillin [PXN (p-Y31)] can be a marker of HCC
progression by examining the status of PXN(p-Y31) in
HCC tissues obtained from surgery in TUZ CHI Hospital. In
the pilot study using Western blot analysis, about 40.7% of
the HCCs exhibited significant elevation of PXN(p-Y31) in
tumor tissues, compared with that in the normal counterpart
(Supplementary Figure S1, upper panel). Surprisingly, one
more intensive band (around 50 kD) beneath PXN(p-Y31)
(63–68 kD) can be observed in most of the HCCs screened
as positive (Supplementary Figure S1, upper panel). We
suspected this to be a protein belonging to the paxillin
superfamily that strongly cross-reacted with the Ab
against PXN(p-Y31). According to a previous report [5],
Hic-5, one of the paxillin paralog with molecular weight
most close to 50 kD, was suggested as the most possible
candidate. Strikingly, Western blot of Hic-5 demonstrated

Validating the role of Hic-5 in HCC progression
using patient derived cell lines
We further focused on investigating whether Hic-5
plays an essential role in the progression of HCC. Initially,
we compared the expression of Hic-5 in several patientderived HCC cell lines, the phenotypes of which such as
cell motility have been characterized [20]. As shown in
Figure 2A, Hic-5 markedly expressed in most of the HCCs
such as HCC329, HCC353, HCC365 and HCC372 with
average to high motility, slightly expressed in HCC363
with average motility but not in the non-motile HCC340
and HCC374 [20]. Notably, HCC329, the most motile

included. As shown in Figure 2B, Hic-5 can be induced in
HCC340 by 25 nM HGF to 3.8-fold at 16 h and increased
to 8.0-fold at 24 h. Also, 50 nM TPA can induce Hic-5
expression to 4.0-fold at 16 h, which sustained until 24 h
in HCC340. Consitently, both HGF and TPA can induce
cell migration of HCC340 to 2.0 and 2.7-fold, respectively
(Figure 2C). Similarly, HGF induced migration of
HCC363 and HepG2 to 3.8- and 2.0-fold, respectively
(Figure 5D), consistent with the HGF-induced Hic-5
expression in HepG2 and HCC363 (Supplementary Figure
S3 and data not shown). However, HGF didn’t induce Hic5 expression in HCC374 at 24 h, although cell migration
of HCC374 can be induced by HGF at 48 h (data not
shown).
Whether Hic-5 was required for constitutive and
inducible cell migration of HCC were investigated by
transient RNA interference. As demonstrated in Figure 3A,
motility of HCC329 and HCC372 greatly decreased after
transfection with Hic-5 siRNA for 48 h by 60%, compared
with the control siRNA group. The efficiency of Hic-5
siRNA was verified by the reduction of Hic-5 (by 85–92%)
in both HCCs transfected with Hic-5 siRNA (Figure 3B).
On the other hand, cell migration of HCC340 and HepG2
induced by HGF was decreased by prior transfection

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the cells with Hic-5 siRNA by 73% and 100%,
respectively, compared with the control siRNA group
(Figure 3C). The efficiency of Hic-5 siRNA was validated
by that HGF-induced Hic-5 expression in HCC340 and
HepG2 transfected with Hic-5 siRNA decreased by 84%
(Figure 3D) and 99% (Figure 7D), respectively, compared
with the control siRNA group. To examine whether Hic-5
is sufficient for triggering cell migration of HCC, a Hic-5
cDNA plasmid, TGFB1I1, driven by the CMV promoter
was employed. Remarkably, cell migration of HCC340,
transfected with TGFB1I1 for 48 h increased to 3.0-fold,
compared with the vector group (Figure 3E). Figure 3F
demonstrated the dramatic increase of Hic-5 expression
(to 7.5-fold) in cell transfected with TGFB1I1. Taken
together, Hic-5 was essential for cell migration of HCCs.
To validate the role of Hic-5 in HCC progression,
HCC329, HCC372 and HCC353 (the HCCs with
high Hic-5) stably depleted of Hic-5, denoted as
HCC329Hic-5(-), HCC372 Hic-5(-), and HCC353
Hic-5(-), respectively, were established by infection of
the cells with a pseudoviral particle containing Hic-5
shRNA sequence inserted within a lentiviral vector. For
comparison, each HCC was infected with the scramble
shRNA to obtain HCC329Scramble, HCC372Scramble

and HCC353Scramble, as negative controls. As
demonstrated in Figure 4A, Hic-5 expression
decreased in HCC329Hic-5(-), HCC372Hic-5(-), and
HCC353Hic-5(-) by 89%, 91% and 75%, respectively, in
comparison with that of each HCC expressing scramble
shRNA. Consistently, motility of HCC329Hic-5(-),
HCC372Hic-5(-),
andHCC353Hic-5(-)
greatly
decreased by 52%, 91% and 35%, respectively, in
comparison with that of each HCC3xxScramble (Figure

coated cultured insert demonstrated that invasiveness
of HCC329Hic-5(-) decreased by 50% compared
with that of HCC329Scramble (Supplementary
Figure S4). Similar result was observed in migration
assay using cultured insert without matri-gel coating
(Supplementary Figure S4). Thus, Hic-5 was essential
for motility and invasiveness of the HCC. Further, the
role of Hic-5 in metastatic capability of HCCs was
investigated using the most motile HCC329 in a SCID
mice model established previously [20]. The cells
(as concentrated pellet) were injected into the middle
lobe of liver followed by observation of the growth of
primary tumor on middle lobe and metastatic loci on left
or right lobe. As demonstrated in Figure 4C, HCC329
cells developed a substantial tumor in the middle lobe
of liver two month after injection. Moreover, multiple
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

loci of intra-hepatic metastasis (IM) can be observed on
the right liver lobe, but with much less loci appearing
on the left lobe. Surprisingly, a big white tumor was
also observed on the abdomen (Fisher’s exact test, SPSS
p < 0.05, N = 3), indicative of extra-hepatic metastasis
(Figure 4C). In contrast, in the mice inoculated with
HCC329Hic-5(-), not only that the growth of primary
tumor in the middle lobe of liver greatly decreased but
also that no metastatic loci can be observed on both
left and right lobe (Fisher’s exact test, SPSS p < 0.05,
N = 3) (Figure 4C). Moreover, HE staining of primary
tumor (in the middle lobe) and metastatic lesion (in
the right lobes) from mice inoculated with parental
HCC329 showed characteristic hepatoma tissue in
the form of trabeculae and cords with an irregular
and dense tissue organization and deep stained nuclei
(Figure 4D). Also, the extra-hepatic metastatic lesion
on abdomen exhibited a more irregular and dense tissue
organization composed of smaller tumor cells with deep
stained nuclei. Surprisingly, a lot of unidentified whitecolored, hard, longitudinal tissues were intercalated
within the extra-hepatic metastatic tumor (Figure 4D).
In contrast, very homogenous and regular architecture
characteristics of the normal liver tissue were observed
in the normal region of middle liver lobe from mice
inoculated with HCC329Hic-5(-) or the normal region

metastatic capability of HCC329 was validated by more
than 6 reproducible animal experiments (Fisher’s exact
test, SPSS p < 0.05, N = 8), 3 of which are demonstrated
in Supplementary Figure S5A. Remarkably, prominent
intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastasis were
observed in livers and abdomens, respectively, of mice
injected with HCC329Scramble, in contrast with the
dramatically reduced HCC progression in mice injected
with HCC329Hic-5(-). Thus Hic-5 was required for

of HCC329 in SCID mice. In addition, metastatic
capability of other non-Hic-5 expressing HCCs such as

that of HCC329 (Supplementary Figure S5B).

initially identified to be one of the clones in ROSinduced expression screen [15]. Moreover, ROS
signaling was known to be essential for progression

we investigated whether Hic-5 expression is ROSdependent. As demonstrated in Figure 5A, treatment

15%, 35% and 62%, at 4, 8, and 24 h, respectively.
Similarly, the antioxidant dithiotheritol (DTT) (0.5 mM)
decreased Hic-5 expression by 30%, 60% and 75%, at
4, 8, and 24 h, respectively. Consistently, CAT and DTT
suppressed cell migration of HCC329 by 40% and 60%,
respectively (Figure 5B). Also, treatment of HCC353
and HCC372 with CAT and DTT for 24 h significantly
decreased Hic-5 expression by 42–70% (Supplementary
Figure S6A), consistent with the suppression of cell
migration by 40–80% (Supplementary Figure S6B).
Moreover, CAT and DTT blocked HGF-induced Hic-5
expression in HCC340 by 70% (Figure 5C), consistent
with the suppression of HGF-induced HCC340 cell
migration by CAT and DTT by 80–100% (Figure 5D).
In addition, CAT and DTT also blocked HGF-induced
cell migration of HCC363 and HepG2 by 30–50% and
50–80%, respectively (Figure 5D). ROS assay using
DCF-DA labeling verified that treatment of CAT and
DTT for 9–12 h decreased ROS generation by 45%
and 80%, respectively in HCC329 (Supplementary
Figure  S7). Taken together, ROS was required for
constitutive and HGF-induced Hic-5 expression and
cell migration of HCCs. On the other hand, H2O2 and
the superoxide (O2−2) generator tert-butyl hydroperoxide
(TBHP) induced Hic-5 expression in HCC340 by 2.5
and 4-fold, respectively, (Figure 5E), consistent with
the 2.0–2.2-fold increase of cell migration (Figure 5F).
These results demonstrated that ROS was also sufficient
for triggering Hic-5 expression and HCC cell migration.

(Supplementary Figure S8). In contrast, constitutive
ERK phosphorylation was only marginally observed
in HCC329 and not influenced by both DTT and CAT
(data not shown). The suppressive effect of both ROS
scavengers on MAPK activation was further examined
in HGF-treated HCCs. As demonstrated in Figure 6B,
JNK phosphorylation gradually increased during HGF
treatment from 4 to 24 h, with the maximal induction
by 6.0 fold at 24 h in HCC340. Remarkably, the HGFinduced JNK phosphorylation at 24 h can be blocked
by CAT and DTT by 25% and 90%, respectively
(Figure 6B) in HCC340. Similarly, HGF-induced
JNK phosphorylation at 24 h can be blocked by CAT
and DTT by 40% and 95%, respectively in HepG2
(Supplementary Figure S9). On the other hand, HGF
induced transient ERK phosphorylation during 4–8 h
which decreased after 16–24 h, and was not influenced
by CAT and DTT at 24 h (not shown). Notably, the
extent of HGF-induced JNK phosphorylation during
16–24 h was the most prominent within the time course,
coinciding with that of HGF-induced Hic-5 expression
in HCC340 (Figure 2B). Since JNK was a well known
downstream signal kinase responsible for transcriptional
regulation, we investigated whether JNK activation is
also required for Hic-5 expression. As was expected, the
JNK inhibitor SP600125 (SP) suppress Hic-5 expression
in HCC329 (Figure 6C), HCC372 and HCC353
(Supplementary Figure S6A, lane 4 in both panels) at
24 h by 62%, 85% and 79%, respectively. Moreover,
HGF-induced Hic-5 expression in HCC340 (Figure 6D)
and HepG2 (data not shown) can be totally suppressed
by SP as efficiently as the c-Met inhibitor JNJ38877605.
In contrast, it was slightly suppressed by PD98059, (the
inhibitor of MEK, upstream kinase of ERK) and not
influenced by worthmannin (the inhibitor of PI3-AKT)
(Figure 6D). In addition, SP effectively prevented HGFinduced cell migration of HCC340, HCC363 and HepG2
(Figure 5D). Taken together, ROS-JNK cascade was
required for both constitutive and HGF-induced Hic-5
expression.

JNK is the downstream effector of ROS required
for Hic-5 expression
In our previous studies, ROS-dependent activation
of MAPK including Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and
extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), well
known to mediate tumor progression [24, 25], were
required for progression of HepG2 induced by TPA
and HGF [8, 9, 19, 21, 22]. Moreover, JNK activation
was required for constitutive migration of HCC329
[20]. Thus we investigated the relationship of ERK
and JNK with ROS-Hic-5 cascade. As demonstrated
in Figure 6A, constitutive JNK phosphorylation was
suppressed by DTT in HCC329 at 8 h by 74% while
CAT didn’t exhibit suppressive effect as DTT at this
time point. However, in a more extended time course
study (Supplementary Figure S8), CAT significantly
suppressed JNK phosphorylation at 24 h (but not at
8 h) by 55% in HCC329. This suggests that CAT had
to take longer time than DTT for suppressing JNK
phosphorylation in HCC329, probably due to the
slower uptake of CAT. Moreover, CAT suppressed
JNK phosphorylation at 8 h as DTT by 60–63% in
HCC353, and the extent of inhibition exerted by both
ROS scavengers was also higher (by 78–82%) at 24 h

Hic-5 expression was essential for ROS
generation and JNK phosphorylation
One interesting study demonstrated that Hic-5 may
directly associate with TRAF4/p47phox complex required
for NADPH oxidase activation, and suggested a role of
Hic-5 in triggering ROS generation in focal adhesion
for cell migration [26]. Thus, it is tempting to observe
whether Hic-5 was also essential for ROS generation in
HCC. As demonstrated in Figure 7A, HCC329Hic-5(-),
HCC372Hic-5(-) and HCC353Hic-5(-) exhibited decreased
ROS generation by 30%, 70% and 35%, respectively,
compared with each HCCScramble. On the other hand,

1.8, 4.9 and 2.2-fold (Figure 7B). In addition, blockade of
Hic-5 expression by siRNA prevented HGF-induced ROS
generation at 6 h in HepG2 (Figure 7C). Together, these
indicated that Hic-5 also acted upstream of ROS. Since
JNK is down stream of ROS, we further investigated

whether Hic-5 was essential for JNK activation. As
demonstrated in Figure 4A, phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK)

Hic-5 plays a critical role in HCC progression

HGF-induced JNK phosphorylation at 24 h in HCC340
and HepG2 by 66% and 90%, respectively (Figure 7D).
On the other hand, overexpression of Hic-5 significantly
increased JNK phosphorylation to 2.1-fold in HCC340
(Supplementary Figure S10). Thus Hic-5 was also required
for constitutive and HGF-induced JNK activation, and
sufficient for triggering JNK activation in HCCs.
Collectively, ROS-JNK signaling can be both
upstream and downstream of Hic-5, suggesting that Hic-5
may be responsible for establishing a positive feedback
signal circuit for cell migration of HCC as elucidated in
“Discussion”.

The involvement of Hic-5 in tumor progression
has been mentioned previously. Hic-5 expression can
be induced by TGFβ leading to epithelial mesenchymal
transition (EMT), cell migration, and invasion [27].
Furthermore, ectopic expression of Hic-5 is sufficient to
promote normal mammary cells to undergo EMT [27].
In addition, the melanoma cell depleted of Hic-5 exhibit
decreased cell motility and metastatic activity in vivo [28].
One recent report demonstrated the upregulation of Hic5 in HCCs overexpressing proline-rich tyrosine kinase
2 (Pyk2) [29], which is known to be involved in HCC
metastasis [30, 31]. Also TGF-β, which is responsible for
triggering HCC progression [32, 33], can induce Hic-5
expression for malignant transformation [27]. In the present
study, we further demonstrated that Hic-5 is essential for
cell migration (Figure 3) and metastasis (Figure 4) of HCC.

LZ-8 suppressed Hic-5, p-JNK and ROS
generation
We further investigated whether the ROS-Hic-5-JNK
pathway can be a potential therapeutic target for preventing
HCC progression. Our recent report demonstrated that
LZ-8 (also known as Lingzhi-8 or Reishi), a medicinal
peptide purified from the Chinese herbal drug Ganoderma
lucidium, prevented HCC progression of HCC329 in vitro
and in vivo [20]. Interestingly, LZ-8 (at 0.5, 2.5 and 5.0
μg/ml) greatly suppressed constitutive Hic-5 expression
and JNK phosphorylation in HCC329 by 85–60% in a dose
dependent manner (Figure 8A). LZ-8 also decreased ERK
phosphorylation in HCC329 by 40% at all concentrations.
Consistently, treatment of 2.5 μM LZ-8 for 0.5, 1.5, 6 and
12 h suppressed constitutive ROS generation in HCC329
by 40–55% (Figure 8B). On the other hand, LZ-8 totally
decreased the HGF-induced Hic-5 expression (Figure
5C), JNK phosphorylation (Figure 6B) and cell migration
(Figure 5D) of HCC340. Interestingly, increased Hic-5
expression coupled with JNK phosphorylation in HCC340
transiently transfected with Hic-5 expressing vector can be
totally suppressed by LZ-8 (Supplementary Figure S10). In
addition, LZ-8 can also prevent the increased cell migration
of HCC340 transiently transfected with Hic-5 expressing
vector for 48 h (data not shown). Taken together, ROS-Hic5-JNK signaling can be blocked by LZ-8 in HCC.

Hic-5 mediates positive feedback ROS-JNK
signaling
The diverse roles of Hic-5 in regulating signal
transduction in various systems has been intensively
studied [for reviews, 12, 16]. Previously, Hic-5 was
found to promote TGFβ-induced signaling by binding
to and inactivating the inhibitory Smads, Smad3 [34]
and Smad7 [35] leading to enhanced TGF-β/Smad2/
MAPK signaling required for EMT. Hic-5 also served as
a scaffold protein that specifically activates the MAPK
cascade [36]. Also, ROS signaling is capable of triggering
Hic-5 gene expression [15] and nuclear translocation
[37]. It was well established that ROS was essential for
triggering tumor progression via a lot of signal cascades
including MAPK [for review, 38]. For example, ROS may
activate JNK to trigger EMT [39] known to be a critical
step for tumor metastasis. One recent study demonstrated
Nox2-dependent ROS-JNK signaling is essential for
HGF-induced mobilization of endothelial progenitor
cells (EPCs), involved in proangiogenesis and tumor
progression [40]. In the present study, we found Hic-5
expression is closely related with ROS-JNK signaling
during HCC progression. On the one hand, ROS generation
and JNK phosphorylation were required for constitutive
and HGF-induced Hic-5 expression (Figure 5, 6). On the
other hand, not only that Hic-5 expression is required for
constitutive and HGF-induced ROS generation (Figure
7A, 7C) but also that ectopic Hic-5 expression was
sufficient for triggering ROS generation (Figure 7B) and
JNK phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S10). Taken
together, Hic-5 can be both upstream and down of ROSJNK, suggesting it plays the central role in establishing a
positive feedback and sustained ROS and JNK signaling
(see Scheme in Figure 9). The ROS and JNK signaling
are known to be closely associated with sustained signal

DISCUSSION
Hic-5 is a potential marker of HCC progression
Previous studies demonstrated that Hic-5 over­
expressed in a varieties of invasive/metastatic cancers,
including breast, lung, and prostate tumors and was
emerging as a potential prognostic marker [16]. In
the present study, we further demonstrated the direct
correlation of Hic-5 with HCC metastasis in 145 HCCs
(Table 1). The association of Hic-5 with HCC metastasis
and the feasibility of Hic-5 as a HCC prognosis marker
are worthy of further validation by screening more HCC
samples.

transduction for a lot of patho-physiological processes. For
example, ROS are responsible for signal cross talks that
triggers sustained MAPK activation and cell migration
[41]. Also, ROS is critical for positive feedback loop
triggering the sustained activation of Akt, which lead to
mesangial cell hypertrophy and diabetic nephropathy [42].

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

On the other hand, sustained JNK signaling was required
for Cylindromatosis (CYLD) (a deubiquitination enzyme)
induced c-MYC expression and histone H3 methylations
for HCC progression [43]. The detailed mechanism for
Hic-5 to mediate sustained ROS-JNK signaling and HCC
progression is worthy of further investigation.

Hic-5 is a more ideal target for prevention of
tumor progression

However, target therapy aiming at paxillin seems unfeasible
due to its ubiquitous tissue expression playing essential role for
diverse biological functions [16]. In contrast, Hic-5 is enriched
only in certain tissue such as smooth muscle and large intestine
[16], thus may be a more suitable therapeutic target.

According to previous studies, both Hic-5 and paxillin
are promising therapeutic targets for anti-HCC progression.

Figure 9: Proposed model for Hic-5-mediated sustained ROS-JNK signaling. Based on inhibitor studies, ROS generation and JNK

phosphorylation were required for constitutive and HGF-induced Hic-5 expression (Figure 5–6). Also, ectopic Hic-5 expression was sufficient
for triggering ROS generation (Figure 7B) and JNK phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S10). Taken together, Hic-5 can be both upstream
and down of ROS-JNK. It can be proposed that the ROS triggered-JNK activation can induce transcriptional upregulation of Hic-5. The Hic-5
protein induced in turn activates Rac-1/NADPH oxidase dependent ROS generation [26] and JNK phosphorylation thus sustaining the signal
transduction and Hic-5 expression. Accordingly, Hic-5 may play a central role in mediating the positive feedback ROS-JNK signaling circuit.

LZ-8 suppressed HCC progression via blocking
ROS-Hic-5-JNK signaling

suppressed ROS generation that block Hic5-MAPK signaling
is worthy of further investigation.
In conclusion, we found the paxillin paralog Hic5 plays an essential role in signal transduction for HCC
progression and may serve as a promising prognosis
marker and therapeutic target for management of HCC.

In previous studies, LZ-8 was found to be both an
immunomodulatory [44] and anti-tumor agent [45, 46].
On the signal level, LZ-8 may suppress the protein kinase
C-dependent pathway [47] known to be involved in HCC
progression triggered by HGF-c-Met [8]. Recently, we also
found LZ-8 suppress HCC progression via blocking c-Met or
c-Met-independent MAPK signaling [20]. In this study, we
further found LZ-8 suppressed constitutive and HGF-induced
expression of Hic-5 coupled with decrease of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) generation and phosphorylation of JNK and
ERK in HCCs. The detailed mechanisms for how LZ-8

(Hsinchu, Taiwan). HCC tissues were collected during
HCC surgery at Tzu Chi Hospital with patient’s
consents, approved by the Research Ethics Committee
in Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital (IRB 10162). The tissues were snap frozen at –80°C before
being harvested for Western blotting or sectioning for
immunohistochemical analysis. HGF was obtained from
Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). TPA, dithiotheritol,
catalase and SP600125, PD98059 and JNJ38877605
were from Sigma (Milwaukee, DC, USA). Antibodies
for Hic-5, phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK), phosphorylated
ERK (p-ERK) and GAPDH were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (California, USA). Antibody
for Hic-5 was also obtained from GeneTex (Irvine, CA,
USA). Hic-5 expression plasmid (TGFB 1I1) was from
OriGene Technologies, Inc. (Washington, DC, USA).
LZ-8 was from Yeastern Biotech Co., Ltd. (Taipei,
Taiwan).

After appropriate treatments, cells that had migrated or
invaded through the matrigel to the underside of the insert
membrane were stained with 0.3% crystal violet. The cells
on the topside of the insert membrane were rubbed with a
cotton swab. The migrated/invaded cells on the underside
were imaged using phase contrast microscopy with 200X
magnification.

Western blot
Western blots were performed according to our
previous studies [8, 9]. The band intensities on the blots
were quantified using Image J software.

Flow cytometric analysis for ROS generation
ROS assay was performed as described in our
previous report [19]. Each determination is based on the
mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 5,000 cells.

Establishing patient-derived hepatocellular
carcinoma cell lines

RNA interference and establishment of cells
stably depleted of Hic-5

Clinically derived HCC cell lines were established
from parts of HCC tissues obtained from surgery with
patient’s consents, approved by Buddhist Tzu Chi general
hospital Research Ethic Committee (IRB 101-62). Briefly,
HCC tissues were pretreated with collagenase and
cultivated on the mitomycin C-treated NIH3T3 feeder
layer for 4 to 6 passages to select the HCC cell lines.
Homogenous HCC cell populations with the sustained
proliferation ability (over 20 passages) were obtained. The
characteristics of the HCC tumor cell lines were validated
by detecting HCC tumor makers, such as Glypican 3
(GPC3) [18], after more than 40 passages.

Hic-5 expression was transiently knocked down
by transfection of the cells with 25 nM Hic-5 siRNA
(Thermo Scientific, Dharmacon, US) for 48 h, according
to the manufacture’s protocol. To obtain stable clones
expressing Hic-5 shRNA, lentiviral plasmids encoding
shRNA for Hic-5 were packaged into 293T cell.
Subsequently, the viral particle-containing mediums
were used to infect HCCs followed by selection with
puromycin for 2–3 weeks.

Establishing hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis
in SCID mice

Immunohistochemistry

The metastasis of HCC was established using
Nod SCID mice as previously [8, 9]. All the mice were
males, 8 weeks old, and had an average body weight
of 35–40  g HCC cells (2 × 106) were suspended in
100 μl DMEM and directly injected into the subserosa
of the middle liver lobe under anesthesia. Two to four
months after inoculation, the mice were sacrificed for
examining the primary tumor growth on middle liver
lobe and secondary tumor foci on left and right lobes.
Nodules with diameters exceeding 0.1 to 0.2 cm on the
left or right lobes were denoted as secondary tumor
foci. Intrahepatic metastasis was defined if a minimum
of two secondary tumor foci can be observed in the left
and/or right liver lobes. Extrahepatic metastasis was
defined by tumors appearing in organs other than the
liver. During animal experiment, which was approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at Tzu Chi University (No. 102080), regulations
relevant to the care and use of laboratory animals were
followed.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for Hic-5 was
performed according to the standard protocols established
by the Research Centre for Hepatology at Tzu Chi
Hospital.

Wound healing migration assay
Wound healing migration assay were performed
according to our previous studies [8, 9]. Quantitation
of cell motility was performed by counting the cells
that have migrated into the blanking area using Image
J software.

Transwell migration/invasion assay
Cells were seeded on a 24-well transwell
migration insert with (for invasion) or without (for
migration) matrigel coating (Nalge Nunc International,
Rochester, NY, USA) in a complete medium for 24 h.
