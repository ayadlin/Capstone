Abstract

Author Manuscript

Choline kinase-α expression and activity are increased in multiple human neoplasms as a result of
growth factor stimulation and activation of cancer-related signaling pathways. The product of
choline kinase-α, phosphocholine, serves as an essential metabolic reservoir for the production of
phosphatidylcholine, the major phospholipid constituent of membranes and substrate for the
production of lipid second messengers. Using in silico screening for small molecules that may
interact with the choline kinase-α substrate binding domain, we identified a novel competitive
inhibitor, N-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)-2-[[5-(4-ethylphenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl]sulfanyl] acetamide
(termed CK37) that inhibited purified recombinant human choline kinase-α activity, reduced the
steady-state concentration of phosphocholine in transformed cells, and selectively suppressed the
growth of neoplastic cells relative to normal epithelial cells. Choline kinase-α activity is required
for the downstream production of phosphatidic acid, a promoter of several Ras signaling
pathways. CK37 suppressed MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling, disrupted actin cytoskeletal
organization, and reduced plasma membrane ruffling. Finally, administration of CK37
significantly decreased tumor growth in a lung tumor xenograft mouse model, suppressed tumor
phosphocholine, and diminished activating phosphorylations of ERK and AKT in vivo. Together,
these results further validate choline kinase-α as a molecular target for the development of agents
that interrupt Ras signaling pathways, and indicate that receptor-based computational screening
should facilitate the identification of new classes of choline kinase-α inhibitors.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Evidence for the requirement of choline kinase-α activity in cancer has been obtained from
observations that choline kinase-α expression is elevated in many tumor types and that this
increase correlates with poor prognosis in both lung and breast cancer patients (Iorio et al.,
2005; Ramirez de Molina et al., 2002a; Ramirez de Molina et al., 2002c). siRNA silencing
of choline kinase-α mRNA expression reduces intracellular phosphocholine, which in turn
decreases cellular proliferation and promotes differentiation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells (Glunde et al., 2005). Furthermore, pro-oncogenic stimuli, including insulin, plateletderived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, prolactin, estrogens
and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, each have been found to stimulate choline kinase-α
activity and increase intracellular phosphocholine (Chung et al., 2000; Glunde et al., 2008;
Jimenez et al., 1995; Ko et al., 1986; Neeman and Degani, 1989; Uchida, 1996; Warden and
Friedkin, 1985).

Choline kinase executes the first committed step within the cytidyl diphosphocholine
(Kennedy) pathway, which allows for the production of the major membrane lipid
component phosphatidylcholine (PC). The phospholipase D mediated catabolism of PC
yields diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid, which each have been shown to be significant
lipid second messengers involved in several signaling pathways (Exton, 1990; Hancock,
2007; Rizzo and Romero, 2002). Phosphatidic acid binds to the amino-terminal Pleckstrin
homology domain of the Ras specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Sos with high
affinity and specificity and promotes the recruitment of Sos to the plasma membrane (Zhao
et al., 2007). Phosphatidic acid also binds to Raf-1 via a 36 amino acid region within the
kinase domain and promotes its recruitment to the plasma membrane where it is activated by
direct interaction with Ras (Rizzo et al., 1999; Rizzo et al., 2000; Scales and Scheller, 1999;
Zhao et al., 2007). Accordingly, phosphatidylcholine-derived phosphatidic acid functions in
part as a mediator of the Ras signaling pathway and thus the choline kinase metabolite
phosphocholine may be essential for the amplification of growth factor signaling cascades
required for survival and growth. We recently demonstrated that siRNA-mediated inhibition
of choline kinase-α suppressed both MAPK and AKT signaling, and that the addition of
phosphatidic acid rescued ERK1/2 activation (Yalcin et al., 2009). In independent studies,
Chua et al. also established that choline kinase-α is required for the activation of AKT in
breast carcinoma cells (Chua et al., 2009). Taken together, these studies indicate that choline
kinase-α activity may be essential for tumor progression not only for the production of
essential phospholipids required for membrane synthesis, but also for the activation of
downstream oncogenic signaling pathways.
Hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) is a known competitive inhibitor of choline kinase that has
structural homology to choline. HC-3 and several of its derivatives have been found to
inhibit cancer cell proliferation (Hernandez-Alcoceba et al., 1999; Hernandez-Alcoceba et

al., 1997; Rodriguez-Gonzalez et al., 2003). One HC-3 derivative in particular, termed
MN58b, inhibits endogenous choline kinase activity and suppresses breast cancer, colon
cancer, and epidermoid carcinoma xenograft growth in vivo (Hernandez-Alcoceba et al.,
1999; Hernandez-Alcoceba et al., 1997; Ramirez de Molina et al., 2004a; RodriguezGonzalez et al., 2003). The pre-clinical activities of HC-3 derivatives against xenografts
coupled to the recently identified requirement of choline kinase for MAPK and AKT
signaling provide substantial rationale for efforts to discover new classes of choline kinase
antagonists.

Herein, we report the in silico identification and biological verification of a novel small
molecule inhibitor of choline kinase-α that suppresses survival signaling and tumorigenic
growth in mice. Our data support the targeting of choline kinase-α as an approach for the
development of therapeutics for cancers that rely on Ras signaling, and demonstrate the
utility of computational screening as a valid means of identifying novel choline kinase-α
inhibitors.

Results
Computational Screening for Small Molecule Inhibitors of Choline Kinase-α

Author Manuscript

We used the recently described X-ray structure of human choline kinase-α (Malito et al.,
2006) to conduct an in silico screen of the ZINC Library to identify potential choline kinaseα interacting compounds. Fifty compounds were identified, scored, ranked, and analyzed
based on their association potential with the active site within choline kinase-α. We
physically tested the 16 best-score compounds for their ability to inhibit choline kinase-α
activity in HeLa cell lysates. Only one of the screened compounds, N-(3,5dimethylphenyl)-2-[[5-(4-ethylphenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl]sulfanyl] acetamide (termed
CK37), significantly inhibited choline kinase-α activity and Figure 1a illustrates its potential
interaction within the substrate-binding domain of choline kinase-α.
CK37 Inhibits Recombinant Choline Kinase-α

Author Manuscript

We then used bacterially expressed recombinant human choline kinase-α to assess the effect
of CK37 on purified choline kinase enzymatic activity. As illustrated in Figure 1b, CK37
exposure resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of choline kinase-α activity. Since CK37
was identified as a potential competitive inhibitor for the choline binding pocket of choline
kinase-α, we examined the competitive effect of choline on the activity of 25μM CK37
against choline kinase-α. We found that increasing the concentration of choline completely
reversed the inhibition of choline kinase-α by CK37 (Figure 1c). These data suggest that
CK37 is a competitive inhibitor of choline kinase by targeting the choline binding site. To
our knowledge, this is the first choline kinase competitive inhibitor that has been identified
through in silico molecular modeling of the choline binding site within the enzyme.
CK37 Decreases Endogenous Choline Kinase Activity and the Steady-State Concentration
of Downstream Choline Metabolites
To investigate the capacity of CK37 to suppress choline kinase activity in whole cells, HeLa
cells were incubated with several concentrations of CK37 in the presence of 14C-labeled

choline. As shown in Figure 2a, CK37 inhibited endogenous choline kinase activity at 1μM
and had the greatest effect at 10μM (61.7% ± 9.7%). Interestingly, choline uptake was
suppressed in the presence of CK37 suggesting that decreased flux through choline kinase
may limit the upstream transport of choline. In support of this interpretation, we also
observed decreased choline uptake and phosphocholine production in HeLa cells that had
been transfected with α-choline kinase-α siRNA that we have previously characterized
(Yalcin et al., 2009) (Figure 2b). Together, these results support the conclusion that CK37
inhibits choline kinase-α and the putative role that choline kinase-α may play in regulating
choline uptake. We next analyzed the steady-state concentration of phosphocholine by 1DNMR in HeLa cells treated with 10μM and 50μM CK37. As illustrated in Figure 2c, CK37
caused a dose-dependent decrease in the phosphocholine concentration in as little as one
hour. We postulated that decreased phosphocholine production via inhibition of choline
kinase-α would result in a decrease in the steady-state concentration of downstream choline
metabolites. Lipids from HeLa cells that had been treated with 10μM or 50μM CK37 for 12
hours were methanol extracted and analyzed by ion mass spectrometry. The concentrations
of phosphatidylcholine and the potent second messenger phosphatidic acid were reduced by
CK37 after twelve hours (Figure 2d). Together, these data suggest that CK37 is able to
suppress intracellular choline kinase activity and cause a reduction in the steady-state
concentration of both plasma membrane and second messenger phospholipids.
CK37 Attenuates MAPK and PI3K/AKT Signaling

Author Manuscript

Phosphatidic acid is a downstream product of the Kennedy pathway, which is initiated by
the phosphorylation of choline by choline kinase. Phosphatidic acid has been found to be
required for the recruitment of a specific Ras guanine-nucleotide exchange factor, Sos, as
well as Raf-1 to the plasma membrane (Rizzo et al., 1999; Zhao et al., 2007). In a recent
study, we found that selective inhibition of choline kinase-α expression reduced
phosphatidic acid and disrupted downstream MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling (Yalcin et al.,
2009). Given that CK37 reduced intracellular phosphatidic acid, we postulated that this
compound also may disrupt signaling through MAPK and PI3K/AKT. As shown in Figure
3(a&b), exposure to 10μM CK37 for 12 hours decreased activating phosphorylations of
ERK1/2 and AKT, whereas total ERK1/2 and AKT levels remained unchanged.
Importantly, viability and cell number at this early time-point were identical between the
vehicle control and CK37 exposure groups (data not shown).
CK37 Disrupts the Actin Cytoskeleton and Membrane Ruffling

Author Manuscript

Phosphatidic acid has also been observed to stimulate actin polymerization, and these actin
stress fibers have been demonstrated to be required for prolonged MEK activation (Ha and
Exton, 1993; Roovers and Assoian, 2003). To investigate cytoskeletal arrangement in
response to CK37 treatment, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy on HeLa cells
using the small molecule phalloidin, which specifically binds to polymerized F-actin, and an
antibody for the focal adhesion protein vinculin. We found that, in the absence of CK37,
HeLa cells displayed extensive polymerization of F-actin, which is directly anchored to the
membrane at vinculin containing focal adhesion points (Figure 4a, see Vehicle). However,
incubation with 10μM CK37 disrupted the localization of focal adhesion points as well as
the appearance of actin stress fibers (Figure 4a). Since CK37 altered the cytoskeletal

organization and was found to decrease the main lipid component of the cellular lipid
bilayer, phosphatidylcholine, we investigated the effects of CK37 on the plasma membrane.
Electron microscopy revealed substantial membrane extensions and ruffling in both HeLa
(Figure 4b, see Vehicle) and MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown). However, incubation
with 10μM CK37 markedly attenuated these membrane structures, as evident in Figure 4b.
Transfection with the choline kinase-α siRNA caused a similar disruption of the actin
cytoskeleton and membrane ruffling as observed after CK37 exposure (Figure 4a&b). These
data support the conclusion that the structural changes caused by CK37 may be directly
related to the inhibition of choline kinase-α activity caused by CK37.
CK37 Selectively Reduces Cancer Cell Proliferation By Targeting Choline Kinase

Author Manuscript

We examined the sensitivity of six neoplastic cell lines from both solid and hematologic
origins to CK37 and found that incubation with CK37 caused a dose-dependent suppression
of cell growth in all six tumor cell lines (Figure 5a; IC50 values: 5 - 10μM; 48 hours). We
next transiently transfected HeLa cells with a plasmid encoding the choline kinase-α open
reading frame and examined the effects on the cytostatic activity of CK37. As demonstrated
in Figure 5b, over-expression of choline kinase-α conferred resistance to the effects of
CK37 compared to vector control cells (IC50: Vector, 4.3μM; +CK, 52μM). These results
demonstrate that the cytostatic activity of CK37 is dependent on the level of choline kinaseα expression. We then compared the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 mammary carcinoma
cells, which have an activating mutation of K-ras (von Lintig et al., 2000) to normal
untransformed mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). The transformed MDA-MB-231 cells
were >5-fold more sensitive to CK37 than the HMECs (compare 50μM HMEC vs. 10μM
MDA-MB-231, Figure 5c).

Author Manuscript

Anchorage-independent growth is a hallmark for tumorigenicity of neoplastic cells. We
examined the ability of CK37 to suppress HeLa anchorage independent growth in soft agar.
CK37 attenuated HeLa soft agar colony formation at 5μM by 86% (Figure 5d&e: Control,
2506 ± 158; +5μM CK37, 360 ± 77). This concentration is below that which is necessary for
comparable effects on cell proliferation (>10μM) suggesting that anchorage-independent
growth may be especially sensitive to choline kinase-α inhibition.
CK37 Treatment Suppresses In Vivo Tumor Growth, Phosphocholine Production, and
Activating Phosphorylations of ERK and AKT

Author Manuscript

In order to define a non-toxic dose of CK37 for use in vivo, we intraperitoneally injected
C57Bl/6 mice with 0.06, 0.07, and 0.08 mg/g of CK37. We observed no clinical signs of
distress at any of the three doses. C57Bl/6 mice bearing Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC)
xenografts (mean baseline mass = 143 ± 14 mg) were given intraperitoneal injections of
0.08 mg/g CK37 daily for eight days. As shown in Figure 6a, CK37 administration
suppressed established tumor growth by 48% compared to the vehicle control group
(Vehicle, 1039.6 ± 60.5; + CK37 566.2 ± 67.1). We then measured phosphocholine levels in
tumors from both vehicle or treated animals, and found that CK37 administration caused a
51% reduction in tumor phosphocholine compared to tumors from control animals (Figure
6b: Vehicle, 0.027 ± 0.005; + CK37, 0.0145 ± 0.001). Our in vitro analysis revealed
suppression in the MAPK and AKT pathways upon CK37 treatment, and we and others have

established that choline kinase-α is required for the activation of MAPK and AKT signaling
(Chua et al., 2009; Yalcin et al., 2009). We confirmed that LLC ERK and AKT activation
was suppressed by CK37 in vitro as demonstrated in HeLa cells (data not shown). We then
performed immunohistochemistry for activating phosphorylations of both ERK (T202/
Y204) and AKT (S473) on LLC tumors from vehicle and CK37 treated animals. We
observed a marked decrease in the activation of ERK and AKT in tumors extracted from
CK37-treated mice (Figure 6c). Quantitative analysis of phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT
revealed a decrease in positive cells of 43% and 50%, respectively, in CK37 treated tumors
(Figure 6 d&e). Together, these data suggest that CK37 mediated suppression of tumor
growth may be due in part to disruption of survival signaling.

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Metabolomic analyses of human adenocarcinomas have identified a 10-20 fold increase in
the steady-state concentration of phosphocholine relative to adjacent normal tissues
(Ackerstaff et al., 2003; Degani et al., 1986; Eliyahu et al., 2007; Glunde and Bhujwalla,
2007; Onodera et al., 1986). The high concentration of phosphocholine observed in
neoplastic tissues is due in large part to the growth factor activated Ras and PI3K signaling
cascades which stimulate choline kinase via the Rho GTPases (Ramirez de Molina et al.,
2005; Ramirez de Molina et al., 2002b; Ramirez de Molina et al., 2004b). Phosphocholine
serves as an essential metabolic reservoir for the production of phosphatidylcholine, the
major phospholipid constituent of membranes and substrate for the production of lipid
second messengers (Aoyama et al., 2004; Kent, 1995). In particular, phosphatidic acid,
generated from the cleavage of phosphatidylcholine by the Ras and PI3K target
phospholipase D2 (Buchanan et al., 2005), has emerged as a key upstream and downstream
activator of Ras signaling (Foster and Xu, 2003; Hancock, 2007; Rizzo and Romero, 2002).
Phosphatidic acid activates and amplifies Ras signaling by: (i) recruiting the guanine
nucleotide-exchange factor Sos (Zhao et al., 2007) and the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 to
the plasma membrane (Rizzo et al., 1999; Rizzo et al., 2000); (ii) stimulating endosome
formation necessary for MAP kinase activation (Rizzo and Romero, 2002); and (iii)
activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase (Fang et al., 2001; Toschi et
al., 2008). Taken together, these studies suggest that phosphocholine may be an essential
metabolic hub not only for membrane phospholipid synthesis but also for the amplification
of neoplastic signaling cascades required for survival and growth.

Author Manuscript

In a previous study, we demonstrated that the steady-state concentration of phosphocholine
is increased in H-RasV12-transformed human epithelial cells relative to normal human
epithelial cells (Yalcin et al., 2009). We then found that siRNA silencing of choline kinase
expression in HeLa cells abrogated the high concentration of phosphocholine, which in turn
decreased phosphatidic acid and signaling through both the MAPK and PI3K/AKT
pathways. This simultaneous reduction in survival signaling resulted in a marked decrease in
the anchorage-independent survival of HeLa cells in soft agar and athymic mice.
Importantly, combination therapies targeting both PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling
pathways may be a more effective strategy than single pathway disruption in patients with
advanced cancers (Kinkade et al., 2008; McCubrey et al., 2007; Salmena et al., 2008).
Given that selective inhibition of choline kinase disrupted both pathways, we expected that

small molecule antagonists of choline kinase may have activity against a broad range of
human cancers propagated by a diverse combination of signaling pathway mutations.
In the current study, we conducted a computational screen for small molecule inhibitors of
choline kinase using the recently solved crystal structure of choline kinase (bound
phosphocholine was used for the ligand-based protomol generation). We identified a lead
compound that (i) inhibits choline kinase activity and the steady-state concentration of
phosphocholine in transformed cells; (ii) is selectively cytotoxic to transformed epithelial
cells relative to normal epithelial cells; (iii) decreases ERK and AKT-activating
phosphorylations; and (iv) suppresses the growth of xenografts in vivo. These studies
indicate that in silico screening of available compound databases has great utility for the
identification of small molecule antagonists of metabolic enzymes.

Author Manuscript

Neoplastic cells have a substantial need for membrane phospholipids as a result of both
rapid cell proliferation and an increased rate of endosome formation required for growth
factor signaling (Li et al., 1997; Vieira et al., 1996) and the secretion of microvesicles or
exosomes (Iero et al., 2008). For example, cancer cell derived vesicular organelles are
elevated in the plasma, ascites and pleural effusions of cancer patients and are believed to be
involved in cell-cell communication and immune suppression (Iero et al., 2008). As a result
of such high endosome formation and exosome secretion, we anticipate that neoplastic cells
require enhanced de novo phospholipid synthesis relative to normal cells. The observation
that CK37 reduced the steady-state concentration of phosphatidylcholine, plasma membrane
ruffling and tumorigenic growth indicates that disruption of de novo phospholipid synthesis
may be an effective anti-tumor strategy.

Author Manuscript

The specter of high toxicity caused by pharmacological targeting of choline kinase was
recently raised by the observation that homozygous genomic deletion of choline kinase-α
causes early embryonic lethality (Wu et al., 2008). However, heterozygous choline kinase
knockout mice develop normally without pathology despite decreased choline kinase
expression and intracellular phosphocholine in the liver (Wu et al., 2008), suggesting that
untransformed wild-type cells may be able to tolerate a large reduction in choline kinase
activity in vivo. Our observations that CK37 is selectively toxic to transformed cells,
attenuates survival signaling and inhibits tumor growth at a non-toxic dose indicates that
small molecule antagonists of choline kinase-α may yield favorable therapeutic indices in
phase I trials of advanced cancer patients.

The human choline kinase-α -2 X-ray structure 2CKQ was used as the target structure. The
water molecules were stripped from the structure and the target site was the area
surrounding the bound phosphocholine. The phosphocholine molecule was stripped but was
used to create a ligand-based protomol, with proto_thresh set at 0.2 and proto_bloat at 1, for

HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma (CCL2), A549 lung adenocarcinoma (CCL-185), Lewis lung
carcinoma (CRL-1642), malignant melanoma (A375: CRL-1619), and MDA-MB-231 breast
adenocarcinoma (HTB-26) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). These cells were cultured in DMEM (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Hyclone) and 50μg/mL gentamicin sulfate (Invitrogen). Jurkat leukemia cells
(ATCC: TIB-152) were cultured in RPMI (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine

were grown in mammary epithelial basal medium (Lonza) supplemented according to
manufacturer's protocol. All cell lines were maintained at 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Recombinant Enzyme and In vitro Choline Kinase Activity

Author Manuscript

Choline kinase-α activity was assayed by recombinant enzyme and in intact HeLa cells
using previously described methods (Hernandez-Alcoceba et al., 1997). For recombinant
choline kinase-α, assays were performed in kinase assay buffer (100mM Tris-HCl, 100mM
MgCl2, 10mM ATP, and 2μM methyl[14C]-choline chloride (50-60μCi, mmol). For
substrate competition assays, recombinant enzyme was assayed in the presence of several
concentrations of choline chloride with or without 25μM CK37. In each case, reactions were
carried out at 37°C for one hour and immediately stopped by addition of TCA to a final
concentration of 16%. The TCA soluble fraction was then washed 3× with four volumes of
water saturated ethyl ether, and dried under vacuum. Metabolites were separated by thin
layer chromatography using 60 Å silica gel plates and a liquid phase consisting of 0.9%
NaCl: methanol: ammonium hydroxide (50:70:5; V:V:V). Radioactive images from three
separate experiments were resolved by PhosphorImager screening and densitometry was
performed using Image Quant software.
For in vitro HeLa cell labeling, cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells / mL and incubated with
different concentrations of CK37 for 48 hours. Methyl[14C]-choline chloride was added 24
hours before cell harvest, and cells were extracted and analyzed as described above.
Densitometry units were normalized to total protein levels for each sample.
NMR Analysis of Intracelluar Phosphocholine Levels

Author Manuscript

Cells were extracted with cold TCA as previously described (Fan et al., 2008), lyophilized
and redissolved in 0.35 mL D2O containing 90 mM DSS. NMR spectra were recorded at 20°
C, 14.1 T on a Varian Inova spectrometer equipped with an inverse triple resonance cold
probe. 1-D 1H spectra were recorded with 256 transients, an acquisition time of 2 sec and a
recycle time of 5 sec, and referenced to a known concentration of DSS. Peak areas of the
phosphocholine resonance at 3.22 ppm, valine, lactate and threonine methyl resonances and
DSS were measured using the Varian VNMR software. Where necessary, small corrections
for partial saturation were made as described previously using measured T1 values (Fan et
al., 2008). The concentration of phosphocholine was then estimated from the ratio of its

an internal standard whose concentration does not change significantly over time (Fan et al.,

Lipidomic Analysis of Choline Metabolites
Lipidomic analysis was performed as a fee for service by the Kansas Lipidomics Research
Center at Kansas State University. Briefly, cell lipids were extracted in methanol, dried
under continuous nitrogen, and then sent for analysis. The Kansas Lipidomics Research

ERK1/2 and AKT Phosphorylation

Author Manuscript

HeLa cells were treated in the absence or presence of several concentrations of CK37 for the
indicated time points. Protein extraction and Western blotting was performed as described
previously (Telang et al., 2006). Blots were probed for p-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204), p-AKT
(S473), total ERK1/2, and total AKT (Cell Signaling, Danvers MA). Densitometry of
immunoreactive bands was performed using Quantity One software to calculate the ratio of
phosphoprotein / total protein of each target protein.
siRNA Transfection, Actin/Cytoskeleton and Focal Adhesion Immunofluorescence

Author Manuscript

HeLa cells were grown on slide coverslips and treated in the absence or presence of 10μM
CK37 for 48 hours. siRNA transfections were performed as previously described using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's
instructions (Yalcin et al., 2009). The final siRNA concentration was 30nM, and the
following siRNA specific for choline kinase-α was used: 5′GACUGUGGUCCAUUGUACAA-GCCAA-3′ (Invitrogen #CHKAHSS140690). Staining
of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion points was performed following the
manufacturer's protocol (Millipore). Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
permeabilized with addition of 0.1% Triton X. The vinculin focal adhesion protein was
visualized using α-vinculin antibody followed by α-rat AlexaFluor 488 secondary antibody.
F-actin was assayed by addition of TRITC-conjugated phalloidin. Immunofluorescence
images were generated using the Olympus BX51WI confocal microscope with Fluoview

postfixed in cacodylate-buffered 1% osmium tetroxide for one hour, dehydrated through a
series of graded alcohols, and embedded in LX-112 epoxy plastic (Ladd Research
Industries). 80 μM sections were cut on a LKB 8800 ultratone utilizing a diamond knife,
mounted on 200 mesh copper grids, stained with uranium acetate and lead citrate, and
viewed with a Phelps CM 12 electron microscope operating at 60KV.

In vitro CK37 Cell Growth Inhibition

Author Manuscript

All cell lines were plated at 1 × 105/mL in the appropriate medium. For suspension cells,
CK37 was added immediately to the medium, whereas CK37 treatment was initiated the
following day for adherent cell lines. For the choline kinase-α over-expression experiment,
HeLa cells were transiently transfected with vector alone or choline kinase-α expression
plasmid (pIRES-neo-CK), and CK37 was added to the medium 48 hours post-transfection.
In all cases, cells were collected 48 hours after treatment, and cell number and viability were
determined by trypan blue exclusion. The IC50 for each experiment was calculated as the
CK37 concentration needed for 50% of vehicle-treated cell growth. The data represented are
the mean ± STD from triplicate measurements from three independent experiments.
Soft Agar Colony Formation

Author Manuscript

HeLa cells were plated at a density of 25 × 103 cells per 60-mm plate with 3mL bottom agar
(0.6%) and 2mL top agar (0.3%) in normal growth medium. Cells were fed every three days
by addition of a new layer of top agar which contained several concentrations of CK37.
After 14 days of growth, colonies were counted from random 1cm squared sections of each
plate.
In Vivo Study

Author Manuscript

Exponentially growing Lewis lung carcinoma cells were collected, washed twice, and
resuspended in PBS (1 × 107/mL). C57Bl/6 female mice (20 g) were injected s.c. with 0.1
mL of the suspension. Body weight and tumor growth were monitored daily throughout the
study. Tumor masses were determined by measurement with Vernier calipers using the
formula: mass (mg) = [width2 (mm) × length (mm)] / 2 (Taetle et al., 1987). Mice with
established tumors (between 130 and 190 mg) were randomized into vehicle control or
CK37 treated groups. Vehicle control groups received i.p. injections of 50 μL DMSO,
whereas treated groups received 0.08 mg/g CK37 in 50 μL DMSO at the indicated time
points. All protocols were approved by the University of Louisville Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. Phosphocholine levels in resected tumors were measured by TCA
extraction of frozen tumor sections and subsequent analysis by 1D-NMR as described
above. Phosphocholine levels were normalized to the stable metabolite valine and to the dry
weight of the TCA extracted tumor section. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed
on paraffin embedded tumor sections by IHCtech, LLC (Aurora, CO) using p-AKT (S473)
(Novacastra, United Kingdom) and p-ERK (T202/Y204) (PhosphoSolutions, Aurora, CO) as
well as the corresponding isotype control antibodies. The intensity of immunoreactive cells
in a 400× field image was graded in a blinded fashion as weakly positive (1), moderately
positive (2), or strongly positive (3).

Statistics
Statistical significance for choline kinase-α inhibition, growth and soft agar colony
formation inhibition, and in vivo studies between control and CK37 treatment was
determined by a two-sample, nonparametric, two-tailed t-test using Graph Pad Prism version
3.0 (Graph Pad Software). p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
