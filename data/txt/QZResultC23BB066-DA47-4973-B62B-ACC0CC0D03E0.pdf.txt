Abstract
Although cancer stem cells have been well characterized in numerous
malignancies, the fundamental characteristics of this group of cells, however, have
been challenged by some recent observations: cancer stem cells may not necessary
to be rare within tumors; cancer stem cells and non-cancer stem cells may undergo
reversible phenotypic changes; and the cancer stem cells phenotype can vary
substantially between patients. Here the current status and progresses of cancer
stem cells theory is illustrated and via providing a panoramic view of cancer therapy,
we addressed the recent controversies regarding the feasibility of cancer stem cells
targeted anti-cancer therapy.

A BRIEF VIEW OF ANTICANCER
THERAPY

Even in developed countries such as Australia, cancer
mortality rates have not changed significantly during
the near 30 years spanning from 1982 to 2011 [5]. The
classical cancer theory may underpin this unchanged
cancer mortality rates.

First initiated in 1946, nitrogen mustard was used
as a chemotherapeutic agent for cancer therapy [1]. By
the early 1990s, anti-cancer drug development had been
transformed from a low-budget, Government-supported
research effort to a high-stakes, multi-billion dollar
industry [2]. This trend continued for the following 20
years. In 2014, it was reported that anticancer drugs
accounted for 10.8% of the total market share of the
pharmaceutical industry with 100 billion US dollars [3].
In sharp contrast to the rapid development of anticancer
drugs, it is reported that cancer has surpassed heart disease
to become the number one cause of death worldwide [4].

STOCHASTIC CANCER THEORY MAY BE
OVERLY SIMPLISTIC
For decades, anti-cancer therapy has been directed
by the clonal evolution (stochastic) theory (Figure 1) [6].
This theory proposes that cancer derives from normal
somatic cells which undergo at least five genetic mutations
[7] before they possess all of the ten cancer hallmarks such
as enhanced proliferation, reduced capacity to undergo

apoptosis and inhibition of differentiation [8]. However,
this classical theory is far from being satisfactory. First, it
is difficult to explain the phenomenon of higher incidence
of some cancers in the first few years of human life relative
to adult years. And it has been suggested that cancer may
not simply be driven by the accumulation of mutation
with age [9]. Furthermore, since differentiated somatic
cells have a limited life span, it would be theoretically
impossible for any given cell to acquire all the necessary
mutations [10]. A more reasonable explanation contends
that it is likely that the initial mutational hit the cell
confers the capacity of unrestrained proliferation, which
provides cells with a sufficiently long lifespan to acquire
the remaining mutations [11]. Following this logic, it
would be reasonable to expect that the status of all cancer
cells in a tumor would be similar and in principle, each
viable tumor cell is equally capable of forming a new
tumor (Figure 1). However, this hypothesis is paradoxical
to a well-known phenomenon - usually more than 10,000
cancer cells are required to reproducibly initiate tumors in
immunocompromised mice [12, 13]. Recent developments
in cancer stem cell (CSC) theory suggest that the classical
theory of cancer initiation and progression may be overly
simplistic [14].

in a tumor [15]. As shown in Figure 2, these cells share
several key properties with normal stem cells [16]. The
first such property is self-renewal. CSCs are built to last
a lifetime and possess the ability to renew themselves
indefinitely with an undifferentiated state. The second
property is asymmetric division, which, in addition to
self-renewal, is responsible for giving rise to differentiated
daughter cells which make up the bulk of the tumor
and are characterized by rapid propagation and limited
or no proliferative potential in the case of progenitor
and bulk cancer cells, respectively. Understanding this
phenomenon is important for cancer therapy, as it means
that the contribution of these daughter cells to the longterm sustenance of the tumor is negligible [17]. In a
tumor, only CSCs are able to initiate tumors as they are
solely capable of self-renewal and unlimited replication
[18]. Third, CSCs are resistant to electromagnetic and
chemical insults. This is mainly because of their infrequent
replication [19], heightened activation of DNA repair
mechanisms (resulting in a lower apoptotic rate) [20],
active drug efflux system [21, 22] and increased defences
against reactive oxygen species [23].
The CSC theory is not an entirely new concept,
having previously been discussed and investigated for
decades [24]. The major reason for it becoming one of
the hottest topics in current cancer research [25] lies in
the explanation it provides for the poorly understood
phenomena observed in both in the clinic and laboratory.
From the perspective of the CSC theory, CSCs are the
prime sources of tumor recurrence and metastasis, as
they confer resistance to traditional electromagnetic and
chemical insults by various strategies. The cancer will
re-occur months or years after treatment. Thus, most of

A REVOLUTIONARY ANTI-CANCER
STRATEGY PROMISED BY CSC THEORY
The CSC theory is based on experimental evidence
that the status of different cancer cells in a tumor is
not equal, similar to that of normal tissues, with some
rare undifferentiated CSCs at the top of the hierarchy
responsible for maintaining the whole population of cells

Figure 1: Schematic of clonal evolution model. Each cancer cell in tumors harbours similar tumorigenic capacity and the progression
of tumour follows the Darwin’s theory of evolution. Of note, the red rim of every cancer cell in this diagram illustrates that they all originated
from a single cancer cell (red cell in A). A., radiation/carcinogens/viruses-induced mutations in a single normal cell (red) transforms it into
a neoplastic cell, conferring selective growth advantages over adjacent normal cells. B., the cancer cell proliferates to produce a cell clone
(Clone 1) and at the same time, due to genetic instability, various new clones (Clone 2, 3, 4, 5) are generated. C., those clones that cannot
survive selective pressures such as hypoxia, hypoalimentation and chemotherapy are eliminated. Occasionally a colony (Clone 5) acquires
survival advantage proceeds and cells from this clone expand to become the predominant population until an even more competitive variant
emerges. D., this stepwise evolution continues in response to survival pressures throughout the tumor progression, eventually additional
mutations endow a group of new cancer cells (Clone 6) with aggressive phenotype, leading to metastasis.

the metastatic cancers are hardly curable with current
anti-cancer treatments (which mainly target the bulk
cancer cells), even when the initial response to radiation
or chemotherapy is encouragingly robust. And in the
laboratory, the rarity of CSCs in a tumor dictates that a
huge amount of cancer cells are needed to initiate tumors
in animal models. Another reason why the CSC theory
has generated such enthusiasm is because of the hope that
a new anti-cancer strategy may emerge - aiming not at
reducing tumor bulk, but rather at targeting the beating
heart of the tumor, the CSCs [26].

DOES CSC HAVE TO BE RARE?
According to the classical CSC theory, only
exceedingly rare CSCs in tumors have the capacity to
initiate tumors. For example, a frequency of less than
0.0001% has been reported in acute myelocytic leukaemia
(AML) [14, 31, 32]. Surprisingly, some recent research
findings suggested that the proportion of stem cell-like
cancer cells in a tumor could be as high as one in four
[31, 33-35], which challenged one of the basic principles
of CSC theory - the hierarchical relationship among cells
in a tumor.
Currently, three methods that originally developed
for the analysis of adult stem cells including mammosphere
assay, cell surface marker expression assay, in vivo tumor
initiating assay (coupled with limited dilution assay) have
been commonly employed for CSC related assessment
(see Box 1). Among them, the in vivo tumor initiating
assay, which involves xenotransplantation of sorted
cancer cells (based on specific cell surface markers)
into immunodeficient mice [36], has been regarded as
the single “gold standard” to define human CSCs. The
controversial results regarding the frequency of CSCs
may have caused by the different research models and
experimental setup employed by different research groups.
For example, in the paper “Tumor growth need not be
driven by rare cancer stem cells”, Kelly et al. reported that
at least 10% of the bulk tumor cells in several transgenic
mouse models of leukaemia and lymphoma were capable
of initiating malignant growth upon transplantation into
mice [33]. However, transplanting mouse tumor cells
into histocompatible mice recipients obviously does not
meet the “gold standard”(transplanting human cells to
immunodeficient mice) and therefore could not speak
for human CSCs. In Quintana’s experiment [31], human
melanoma cells were transplanted into immunodeficient
mice. However, instead of employing commonly used
NOD/SCID mice, non-obese diabetic, experiments were
conducted with severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/
SCID) Il2rg-/- mice.
Undoubtedly, the current in vivo tumor initiating
models used to assess CSCs is a suboptimal “gold
standard” with intrinsic limitations [37]. For example,
the mouse tissues to which human cancer cells are
transplanted provide a different microenvironment to the
original environment from where they arise. In recent
years, although improvements to the xenotransplant
models have dramatically increased their sensitivity and
reliability (see Box 2), it is still accepted that the variations
in animal models used for CSC assessment affect the CSC
frequency measured quantitatively but not qualitatively
[17]. Keeping this in mind, it is unsurprising to see
differences in CSC frequency reported among studies in

CONTROVERSIES OVER CURRENT CSC
THEORY
The CSC theory is possibly the most controversial
topic in current biomedical research - it is even hard to
reach an absolute consensus on the most basic issue of
how to name this group of cells. In recent 10 years various
names such as CSC, stem cell-like cancer cell, tumorinitiating cell and tumor-propagating cell have been
suggested by different research groups. In fact, this is
why in many occasions the CSC theory is also referred to
the CSC hypothesis [28]. However, it is understandable
considering our understanding of CSCs is still not
complete and generally based on the understanding of
normal stem cells. Currently, the controversy over the
CSC theory focuses mainly on the origin and frequency of
CSCs as well as their phenotypic and functional properties
[29].

HOW CAN DORMANT CSCS MAINTAIN
A CERTAIN POPULATION SIZE IN
TUMORS?
A logically paradoxical concept regarding CSC
theory is that CSCs have to be dormant to be resistant to
therapy yet have to proliferate together with normal cancer
cells to maintain a certain proportion size in tumors. This
contradiction has long been explained by the introduction
of the concept of “cancer stemloids”. According to this
explanation, not all CSCs in tumors are proliferating selfrenewing cancer cells. While true CSC is shielded from
selective pressure and unable to drive tumor progression,
cancer stemloids undergo clonal selection, accumulate
mutations and eventually drive tumor progression [27].
Actually, this explanation is theoretically important as
it provides a basis to design therapies to selectively kill
proliferating self-renewing CSCs without killing normal
stem cells. This is because currently reported CSC markers
are often expressed on normal stem cells as well. The
proliferating yet self-renewal status of cancer stemloids
distinguishes them from the quiescent normal stem cells.

conditions, differentiated epithelia tissues including
skin, mammary gland and intestine could display
regenerative activities [46, 47] - a main property of stem
cells. Notably, the 2012 Nobel Prize has been awarded to
investiga­tors who demonstrated that mature, specialized
cells can be reprogrammed to become immature cells
capable of developing into all tissues of the body [48,
49]. Considering the great impacts of hypoxia [50],
acidic stress [51] and nutrient deprivation [52] on tumor
microenvironment, it should come as no surprise to see a
certain extent of plasticity between CSCs and bulk cancer
cells.
Given the potential plasticity of CSCs, it has been
contended that “only if the CSC phenotype is a stable
trait, will it be advantageous to selectively target CSCs
as a cancer treatment” [17]. Certainly, the plasticity of the
CSC state adds complexity to both CSC regulation and
cancer in general. However, from the perspective of cancer
therapy, what’s more important is to verify if CSCs exist
and if they are the root of tumor recurrence and metastasis.
In contrast, it is not that important as to where CSCs come
from. If there is anything to be learned, it is that both CSCs
and the bulk cancer cells should be targeted to cure cancer
(Figure 2) [53]. Actually, this is exactly why almost all of
the current clinical trials aimed at CSCs are combined with
traditional tumor treatment [19].

which different animal or cancer cell models had been
employed. Since it is ethically impossible to transplant
cancer cells to human bodies, this debate will most likely
remain unsolved in the near future. The different results
in CSC frequency may also result from the heterogeneous
feature of tumors. As has been reported, even strictly
defined normal tissue stem cells showed different
differentiation and self-renewal capacities in accordance
with different sites or stages of development [38, 39].
Considering the even higher heterogeneity present among
tumors, it is actually expected to see a certain degree of
difference in the CSC frequency.
Recently, based on observations that there may be
a large proportion of CSCs in tumors, some researchers
questioned the necessary of the CSC-targeted anticancer
therapy [40]. Obviously, there are flaws with this
argument. First, according to the analyses above, the
data on CSC frequency itself is affected by different
experimental setting and the heterogeneous status of tumor
and therefore debatable. Second, it should be emphasized
that the fundamental hypothesis underlying the CSC
theory is based on the phenomenon of the existence of
purified single cells with tumor-initiating capacity rather
than the absolute frequency of them [41]. It follows that
the frequency of CSCs within a tumor is irrelevant to the
concept of whether a tumor adheres to the CSC theory.
Even if it is true that therapeutic resistant CSCs make up
a large proportion in some types of tumor, the therapeutic
implications of CSCs would remain the same and from
another perspective, it would only indicate that controling
CSCs will be more urgent and more challenging than
previously expected.

ARE CSC MARKERS RELIABLE?
CSC markers are cell surface proteins associated
closely with specific phenotypic and transcriptional
profiles of CSCs [54]. In recent years, with various CSC
markers being reported in various types of cancers, CSC
markers hold great potential in not only clinical diagnosis
and basic cancer research but also in developing CSC
targeted anti-tumor therapies[55, 56], as detailed in recent
reviews [25, 57].
However, it should be noted that thus far there is no
uni­versal marker for CSCs identified. All of the currently
described CSC markers can be detected not only on CSCs
but also, more or less, on normal stem cells or normal
cancer cells or even normal tissues [25, 57, 58], leading
concerns of “The markers that have been used so far to
define CSCs constitute unlikely candidates for antibody
therapy given that they are usually broadly expressed in
healthy tissue” [16] and “relying on markers will fool you
[29]”. These comments imply that “CSC markers should
be detected only on CSCs” and “there should be a CSC
marker expressed on many types of CSCs”. In reality,
since current understanding suggests CSCs probably
originate from either normal stem cells or bulk cancer
cells, it is conceivable that CSCs share certain degree of
protein expression pattern with the cells they come from.
Moreover, considering the extensive heterogeneity even
in a single tumor, it is unrealistic to expect a marker to
be observed on many kinds of CSCs. Different CSC may

THE IMPLICATION OF CONVERSION
BETWEEN NON-CSCS AND CSCS?
Early understanding of CSC theory has suggested
that CSCs arise from normal stem cells [42]. This is
because the majority of cancers develop in epithelia that
undergo substantial cell turnover. In epithelial tissues,
only stem cells remain in the body and proliferate for long
enough to accumulate the number of mutations required
to develop into cancer. However, recent studies suggest
that the state of CSCs is quite plastic, such that they can
arise from a progenitor or even normal cancer cell that has
acquired the capacity for sustained self-renewal through
mutation, epigenetic change, or both [24, 37, 43, 44].
Indeed, this plasticity has been demonstrated in human
colon cancer cells by simply retrovirally introducing a
set of defined factors (OCT3/4, SOX2 and KLF4) [45].
This observed plasticity of CSCs challenged another basic
hypothesis of CSC theory - unidirectional development,
and raised the question of “how can a CSC truly be a stem
cell if non-CSCs can become CSCs? [29]”
In fact, this phenomenon is not exclusively observed
in CSCs. As reported several times, under certain

have different CSC markers. However, once a marker
can be confirmed to be overly expressed on CSCs, such a
marker can be exploited for targeted cancer therapy, even
if it is only expressed on one type of CSC, or it is also
expressed at a low level in other tissues [57].
Compared with the specificity of CSC markers,
the stability of CSC markers represent an even bigger
obstacle for CSC diagnosis and treatment. Recently, it has
been reported that the cell populations (defined by surface
marker/marker combination) meeting the gold standard of
CSC assessment (in vivo tumor initiating assay) has not
proved to be singular or even stable [59]. For instance, in
earlier studies it was recorded that the AML CSCs were
confined in CD34+CD38− population as confirmed through
in vivo tumor initiating assay. However, subsequent
experiments observed that CD34+CD38+ AML cells also
demonstrated similar CSC activity [60-62]. In other cases,

similar phenomena of coexisting or unstable CSC markers
have also been observed in several of human solid tumors
[63-66] and human acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) [67].
The instability of CSC markers may have resulted from
the well-established notion that the malignant tumor cells
with aberrant gene expression regulation are capable of
altering developmental control and/or the stability of the
expression of cell surface markers. This is especially true
when studies were conducted in vitro [68].
Taken together, while CSC markers are informative
to understand the population being studied and promising
for active targeting, they alone cannot define CSCs [29].
Given the current lack of specificity and instability in
certain cases, the reliability of any CSC marker in specific
application settings (CSC analysis or targeted treatment)
has to be tested experimentally via the in vivo tumorinitiating assay.

Figure 2: Schematic of current cancer stem cell theory. Cancer stem cells are solely capable of self-renewal and unlimited

replication and responsible for maintaining the whole tumour. Cancer stem cells show plasticity so that under certain microenvironment,
normal cancer cells can convert to cancer stem cells. During tumour progression, different cancer stem cell clones coexist, which are abide
by the principle of evolution. A., a cancer stem cell forms due to mutations in normal stem cells, progenitor cells and/or differentiated
cells; B., the created cancer stem cell divides asymmetrically and generates daughter cancer stem cells and differentiated bulk cancer cells
that can acquire mutations subsequently. At the same time, a new cancer stem cell can be created from mutated cancer stem cell or bulk
cancer cell; C., different types of cancer stem cells coexist and are responsible for the observed tumor heterogeneity. D., conventional
chemotherapy kills bulk cancer cells but largely leaves chemo-resistant cancer stem cells untouched, leading to tumor relapse. E., killing
the cancer stem cells leads to gradual tumour regression, during which new cancer stem cells may converted from mutated bulk cancer cells
and cause tumour relapse; F, targeting both cancer stem cells and the bulk cancer cells may result in eventual tumor eradication.

STRATEGIES FOR CSC TARGETING

stem cells have been studied intensively.
By far the most exploited signaling pathways
associated with the self-renewal of CSCs are the
Hedgehog signalling, Notch signalling and Wnt/β-catenin
signalling pathways, [77, 80]. Several agents targeting
these pathways have shown promising preclinical results
and are currently under investigation in phase I and II
clinical trials [19, 81]. Actually, Vismodegib, a Hedgehog
inhibitor approved for basal cell carcinoma treatment has
made its way into clinic in 2012 [82]. Targeting Notch
signaling pathway, a pathway best known for shaping
embryonic development, also demonstrated potential in
regulating CSC fate in various types of cancers, including
both solid tumors and leukaemia [72]. Indeed, different
Notch inhibitors such as γ-secretase inhibitors and
monoclonal antibodies have been evaluated in the past
few years [72, 83-85]. In 2014, OncoMed’s Tarextumab,
a Notch pathway targeted monoclonal antibody attracted
attention, in a safety study for pancreatic cancer - a disease
in which traditional chemotherapy rarely helps, the
combinatorial treatment of Tarextumab and conventional
chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in the stabilization
or shrinkage of the tumor over periods of as long as 12
months in 83% of 29 patients [86]. At present, a phase II
trials has been commenced for Tarextumab in pancreatic
and lung cancers [19].
As for promoting the differentiation of CSCs, bone
morphogenic protein (BMP) and oncostatin M (OSM)
are among the mostly studied signalling pathways.
Encouraging results have been reported recently. For
example, through the stimulation of BMP signalling
in colorectal CSCs by BMP4 (a natural ligand of MBP
receptor), Lombardo et al. observed not only increased
terminal differentiation but also enhanced chemo-

As hoped, a win in the clinic will solve many of
the controversies regarding the CSC theory [19]. In
recent years, despite expensive failures in earlier clinical
trials and fundamental discrepancies about CSC theory,
a new round of “gambling” has been launched, with
more than sixty CSC-targeted reagents currently being
registered for clinical trials [19]. For CSC therapy, the
enhanced drug-resistance and microenvironment (niche)
of CSCs represent feasible targets and have been intensely
exploited. Our knowledge of tumor genetic and signalling
pathways collected in the past decades including the
increased understanding of various oncogenic derivatives,
adhesion molecules, antibody-accessible surface
components, signalling intermediates, survival pathway
elements, chromatin modifiers and metabolic targets
provides valuable tools and targets in this area [69-75].
Generally, CSC targeted therapies can be classified
according to the therapeutic strategies employed as
detailed below.

“DESTEMMING” CSCs
Although the strategy of “destemming” CSCs [76]
includes two aspects, either promoting CSC differentiation
into non-CSCs or inhibiting their self-renewal property,
the ultimate aim is the same - “exhausting dormant CSCs”
(Figure 3).
With mounting evidence suggesting that there
are similarities between normal stem cells and CSCs in
terms of their self-renewal and differentiation signaling
pathways [77-79], several critical signaling pathways
involved in self-renewal and differentiation of normal

challenged based on the fact that despite considerable
efforts, rare clinical benefit of inhibitors to such proteins
has been realized [97], implicating a mechanism of
redundancy and/or complexity in this area.
Although the active survival pathways have not
been characterized in detail in CSCs, the deregulation of
both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways
have been reported in this population of cells [98]. For
example, the overexpression of the Bcl-2 family, a group
of anti-apoptotic proteins related to the critical step of
intrinsic apoptotic cascade (mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization) have been observed in most types of
CSCs [99, 100]. Accordingly, Bcl-2 inhibitors such as
ABT-199, ABT-737 and TW-37 have shown prominent
CSC targeting capacity. According to a recent report, as
a single agent, ABT-737 alone was able to inhibit the
frequency of CSCs and reduce CSCs content in treated
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) as well as solid tumors
such as lung and breast cancers [100-103]. On the other
hand, targeting extrinsic apoptosis pathway, especially
TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), is also
showing promising results [104]. In addition to directly
using TRAIL as a drug, engineering of mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) for TRAIL delivery represents a novel
therapeutic option. After systemic injection, TRAILexpressing MSCs was observed to be able to localize to
the site of the tumor and successfully eliminate metastatic
CSCs [98, 105].
As another important aspect of apoptotic machinery,
the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family has been
regarded as the last protective measure against apoptosis
since it prevent both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis by
inhibiting caspase activity [106]. Among the eight human
homologues of IAP family, survivin and XIAP have
received more attention in recent years, with more than
30 survivin- and XIAP-based anti-cancer preparations
undergoing clinical trials [107]. From the perspective
of CSC targeted therapy, survivin is quite unique. First,
different from other IAP family members and Bcl-2 family
members, survivin specifically overexpresses in human
cancers and dose not express in most adult tissues, which
makes it an attractive target for anticancer therapy [106];
second, together with Hiwi, hTERT genes, survivin has
been proposed to be an important stem cell-associated
gene and the co-expression of all of these three genes has
been shown to result in a significantly increased risk of
tumor-related death in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma
[108]; last, enrichment of survivin has been described
in different types CSCs including AML, glioblastoma,
liver, breast and astrocytoma. Via suppression of survivin,
prominent induction of apoptosis of CSCs was observed in
breast and liver cancer as well as in recurrent glioblastoma
[109-113].

sensitivity of CSCs [87]. The phenomenon of chemosensitization was also detected following the activation of
OSM signalling in breast [88-90] and liver CSCs [91]. All
of these results indicate that the combinatorial treatment of
signal transduction and conventional chemotherapy may
aid in eradicating CSCs [90]. Recently, the importance of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of
rapamycin (P13K/mTOR) signalling pathway in regulating
the balance between proliferation and differentiation of
CSCs was revealed [92]. Some inhibitors targeting this
pathway have been showing promise in CSC targeted
therapy, with some dual inhibitors undergoing clinical
trials with advanced breast, ovarian and small-cell lung
cancers [92].
What should be taken into account is that since these
signaling pathways are shared by both CSCs and normal
stem cells, and these pathways auto-regulate and interact
with many other pathways, any global adjustment of these
pathways will likely disturb the function of normal stem
cells and cause potential toxicity. For example, in the late
2000s, the U.S. National Cancer Institute together with
commercial partners conducted small-scale safety trials
of reagents aimed at CSC signaling pathways (including
Hedgehog and Notch) and observed serious side effects
on normal stem cells [19]. Therefore, considerable
caution must be exercised when evaluate the full effects
of intervention with any single pathway [93].

DIRECTLY
TARGETING
DRUG
RESISTANCE MECHANISMS OF CSCs
CSCs are best characterized by enhanced drugresistance, which could be derived either directly from
their previous generations or through accumulation of the
constant genomic and epigenetic mutations [94]. While
both promoting differentiation and inhibiting self-renewal
can destem CSCs and eventually increase the chemosensitivity of CSCs, molecules or pathways directly
related to drug resistance of CSCs such as multidrug
resistance proteins and anti-apoptotic pathways have also
been explored.
Accumulating evidence suggests that some
protecting mechanisms of normal SCs such as MDR
transporters also operate in CSCs. These transporters,
belonging to ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, are wellknown to be able to pump exogenous small molecules
out of cell membrane and therefore cause resistance to
a wide range of conventional drugs. Furthermore, some
transporters such as ABCB5 has been used as CSC marker
for melanoma CSCs [95]. In fact, the overexpression of
ABCB2, also known as breast cancer resistance protein
(BRCP1), was recently shown to be responsible for
chemo-resistance of glioblastoma CSCs to a variety of
agents including Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, Etoposide, and
Temozolomide [96]. However, the role of these drug efflux
pumps in modulating drug resistance of CSCs has been

is able to enhance the entry of CXCR4+ cells into the
bone marrow [122]. Recently, several effective CXCR4
antagonists have been developed to immobilize CSCs and
sensitize them to traditional chemotherapies [123, 124],
with Plerixafor (AMD3100) and some T14003 analogs
being tested in clinical trials for leukaemia [122].
Pioneered by Judah Folkman back in 1971 [125],
targeting of angiogenesis has long been a hot point
in cancer research. However, the benefit of targeting
angiogenesis upon inhibiting CSCs was studied just
recently. Encouraging results were collected from earlier
studies designed to explore the CSC targeting capacity
of clinically available antiangiogenic drugs such as
Bevacizumab, Sunitinib, and Lenalidomide. For example,
via treating U87 glioma bearing mice with bevacizumab,
Calabrese et al. observed decreased microvasculature
density and tumor growth, in addition, the authors
observed a reduction in the number of CD133+/nestin+
CSCs [126]. At the same time, very similar results on
glioblastoma were also observed by other investigators
[127]. But the hope of employing ready-made
antiangiogenic drugs to deal with CSCs was shattered
when accumulating clinical and preclinical evidence
indicated that the benefits of antiangiogenic agents to
the long-term overall survival of patients was negligible
[128, 129]. Furthermore, new research using preclinical
models suggest that antiangiogenic agents actually
increase invasive and metastatic properties of cancer
cells and even worse, both Sunitinib and Bevacizumab,
two of the most frequently used antiangiogenic agents,
adversely increased the population of CSCs in malignant
tumors [130]. In light of these limitations, the approval of
Bevacizumab for treatment of advanced breast cancer has
recently been revoked by U.S. FDA [131]. These adverse
effects are understandable. By inhibiting the growth of
new tumor vasculatures, the harsh environment (hypoxia
and hypoalimentation) created by antiangiogenic agents
pushes the relevant cancer cells/CSCs down towards an
extreme path - death or evolve into a more malignant state.
With the activation of critical molecules for CSC survival
such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and Akt/β-catenin
regulatory pathway [130], these antiangiogenic agents
in fact create a microenvironment in which the survival
advantage of CSCs was enhanced. Therefore, it is now
suggested that angiogenesis-targeted treatment alone may
not be sufficient to improve patient outcome. Rather, it
is imperative to combine antiangiogenic agents with CSC
targeted treatments [130].
However promising it may be, CSC niche associated
studies do not come without concerns. First, it is still
unclear how particular cells in the CSC niche contribute
to the behaviour of CSCs and how their influence on
CSCs are mediated at a molecular level [132]; second,
further studies are needed to investigate whether, and to
what extent, CSCs contribute to important features of
their microenvironment through autocrine or paracrine

The concept of the CSC niche is derived from the
understanding of the normal stem cell niche, in which
normal stem cells have discrete locations in tissues and
are regulated by its microenvironment [114]. Similarly,
CSCs in tumors are in a complicated ecosystem consisting
of bulk cancer cells, various endothelial, hematopoietic,
stromal fibroblast and perivascular/vascular cells. As a
component of this system, the CSCs are heavily influenced
and supported by their surrounding environment [115].
In fact, the overall fitness of any cell (CSC/non-CSC)
in a tumor is modulated by its microenvironment. This
is because the interaction of the tumor components
inevitably causes metabolic inconsistency within a tumor
and results in topical nutrient deprivation, hypoxia or
other survival pressure [50-52]. These survival stress in
turn pushes all the surrounding cells towards a status best
fitting its particular microenvironment and eventually
creates the well-known heterogeneous property of tumors
[115]. Specifically for CSCs, the frequently observed
discrepancies in drug sensitivity between in vitro and in
vivo treatments provide evidence that the niche in which
a CSC is located pivotally determines its response to a
given treatment [116]. And when the cell phenotype
was studied, it was discovered that the epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CSCs, which usually
results in more aggressive and metastatic phenotype, was
affected considerably by their niche [117]. The implication
of all these is that the niche of CSCs directly affects the
drug sensitivity and mobilization of CSCs and therefore
represents a potential target for CSC-directed therapy.
In recently years, the influences of adhesion
receptors, cytokine receptors, membrane-bound cytokine
ligands, and various chemotactic factors upon the status
of CSCs have been studied [114]. These results, along
with the previously described cellular components of
CSC niche such as endosteum cells in the bone marrow,
perivascular/vascular cells and tissue macrophages [118],
provide us with precious opportunities to develop CSC
niche-targeted therapies. Among them, focal adhesion
kinase (FAK) is one of the mostly investigated targets in
both academia and industry [119, 120]. Also known as
protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2), FAK is an enzyme that
plays an important role in cell adhesion, spread, motility,
invasion, metastasis, survival, angiogenesis, and EMT.
Many believe that blocking FAK could not only directly
eradicate CSCs but also prevent these rare cells within
primary tumors to travel through the bloodstream and seed
metastases [19]. Several orally available FAK inhibitors
such as VS-6063 and VS-4718 have shown promise in
counteracting CSCs in recent clinical trials [121]. Another
promising targets is CXCR4, which is expressed on many
types of cancer cells and works as a receptor for stromal
cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1; also termed CXCL12). As a
niche-derived chemo attractant for CXCR4+ cells, SDF1

It has never been easy to cure diseases such as
cancer. Over the past 60 years, too many inspiring
discoveries and techniques for cancer treatment have
eventually been shown to be relatively less useful in the
clinic [19]. Admittedly, the current CSC theory remains
contentious and the controversies may remain in the next
few years. However, CSC-targeted therapy does provide
us with a new and promising opportunity to treat tumor
cells that are resistant to current therapies and responsible
for recurrence and treatment failure. Furthermore, the
concept of CSC-targeted therapy is feasible as evidenced
by many of the encouraging results obtained in recent
CSC-related clinical trials. With better understanding of
the fundamental biology of CSCs, improved functional
assessment models and achievements in biotechnology
such as gene expression profiling, next generation
sequencing and high content screening, we are closer to
achieving the goal of eradicating CSCs.

[142], which provides the basis for the most popular in
vitro CSC assay - mammosphere or tumorsphere forming
assay [143]. Recently, this assay has been commonly
employed in various CSC-associated studies and often
serves as a surrogate for the in vivo tumor initiating assay.
The tumorsphere forming assay involves the dissociation
of cultured cells or tumours into a single cell suspension
and subsequent culture on non-adherent substrata in the
presence of serum-free media supporting the growth of
CSCs until they form organized cellular spheres, each
containing at least 50 cells. Of note, since progenitor
cells are able to proliferate several times, the formation of
primary tumorspheres is in fact the measure of a collective
activity of CSCs and progenitor cells. Therefore, to
accurately evaluate CSCs, primary tumorspheres should
be harvested, dissociated into single cells, and passaged to
create a ‘second’ generation or even tertiary tumorsphere
to exhaust the self-renewal capacity of progenitor cells
[144]. Another method for CSC assessment is based on the
specific phenotypic and transcriptional marker profiles of
CSCs [54]. In practice, this method is very straightforward
and cost-effective and therefore more clinically applicable.
In recent years, with the increasing number of CSC related
cell surface markers reported in various types of cancers,
this method holds great potential in not only clinical
diagnosis and basic cancer research but also in developing
CSC-targeted anti-cancer therapies.

Current CSC assessment models

Limitations and progression of CSC assessment
models

Because of the similarities between CSCs and
normal stem cells in their primary characteristics (selfrenewal and multipotent differentiation), methods
developed originally for analysis and characterization
of adult stem cells have been transferred to CSCs. The
in vivo tumor initiating assay is by far the single gold
standard for CSC analysis. This approach involves
demonstrating the tumor initiating capacity of cells that
are directly isolated from tumors to produce new tumors
in immunocompromised mice. It was firstly conducted to
enumerate CSCs in ALL [135], AML [136] and chronic
myeloid leukaemia (CML) [137]. Later, its application was
extended to solid human tumors including breast cancer
[13], colon cancer [138, 139], ovarian cancer [66], lung
cancer [140] and head and neck cancer [141]. However,
the in vivo tumor initiating assay is not only expensive
but also time consuming, with a standard assessment
taking as long as 6 months or even longer. Therefore,
a reliable in vitro assay model is required to efficiently
and cost-effectively define CSCs. In 1992, Reynolds and
colleagues developed an in vitro technique termed the
neurosphere assay to quantify activity of neural stem cells

Although cell surface marker analysis represents
a convenient CSC assessment method, its reliability
relies on a prerequisite that the employed CSC markers
must show sufficient stability, generality and specificity.
However, considering the phenotypic and genomic
heterogeneity shown in tumors even with a similar
histological appearance and grade, it is inevitable to see
unstable cell surface marker expression patterns among
CSCs [25, 57]. As a result, in the past decade, although
various surface marker combinations (rather than a
single marker) have been successfully used to detect or
isolate CSCs in various types of tumors, to standardize
this method in clinical application is still a considerable
challenge [57].
Compared with surface marker analysis,
tumorsphere formation assay is comparatively more
reliable. However, concerns regarding this method has
been raised given the fact that it is after all conducted
in an artificial and less physiological in vitro setting. A
typical test period for tumorsphere assay lasts one to
several weeks, during which the tested cells are likely

mechanisms, or by creating clonal niche components
[133]; last, similar to the strategy of targeting destemming
signaling pathways, CSCs share similar niches with
normal stem cells, and therefore potential side effects
associated with targeting CSC niche have to be considered
and circumvented [134].

to undergo abnormal differentiation and transform into a
clinically irrelevant state [133]. In addition, the artificial
cell culture conditions could unavoidably cause no
growth of the tested cells [145]. Consequently, it is widely
accepted that the tumorsphere forming assay, although
shows comparative advantages in in vitro tests, itself is not
sufficient for deducing clinically meaningful predictions
[143]. For solid evidence of the presence of CSCs, the
functional in vivo tumor-initiating assay is irreplaceable.
As for the in vivo tumor-initiating assay, although
immunocompromised mice have been commonly
employed, to what extent the results collected from
mice faithfully reflect the CSC properties of cancer cells
in patients is unclear [94]. First, the relatively shorter
lifespan of mice poses the question of how faithfully
the results collected from mouse models reflect the
clinical outcomes. Applying secondary recipients or
long lifespan animal models represent potential solutions
for this problem [94]. Second, the altered setting of
transplanted tumor cells, including the species difference
and the changed microenvironment weigh heavily
against the reliability of this assay both phenotypically
and genetically [114]. In this respect, the application
of genetically modified humanized mouse models has
provided a solution to at least partly solve this problem
[146-150]. Apart from using modified animal models,
orthotopic injection of cancer cells into the targeted
organs and supplementing human stromal elements are
also beneficial and these have become common practice
in recent years [41, 151]. Third, the absence of immunesurveillance in the immunocompromised mouse model
compromises its reliability in mimicking the normal in
vivo environment. Accordingly, the mimicry of natural
immune surveillance mechanisms can be partly achieved
through injection of specific immune effector cells
[152]. Cells used for in vivo tumor initiating assay add
another layer of complication. Of note, instead of using
cells directly derived from patients, cell lines have been
frequently used in CSC studies. Although these cell linebased results are commonly translated to the types of
cancers they dissociated, the extent to which the behaviour
of such cell lines reflecting the clinical tumor cells is
highly debatable. To solve this problem, patient-derived
primary cells have been confirmed to be an ideal choice.
However, it should be noticed that since the in vitro cell
culture system provides cells with a dramatically different
microenvironment from the original tumors from which
they derived, the primary cells should not be continuously
cultured in vitro and amplification of these cells via
xenograft can improve the reliability of this gold standard
assay [29].
A recent study led by Jacobsen and coworkers
illustrated a genetic analysis-based novel CSC assessment
method to directly analyse CSCs in the human body.
Through backtracking of all identified somatic genetic
lesions in the bulk bone marrow, the existence of rare and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

distinct human CSCs was confirmed in myelodysplastic
syndrome patients [37]. This study, though elaborate, not
only provided direct evidence of the existence of rare
CSCs but also provided a genius strategy to bypass the
ethical barrier of transplanting cancer cells into humans.
