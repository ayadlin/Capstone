Responsiveness of Tumor Cells to Topoisomerase
II-Targeting Drugs

Abstract
Topoisomerase II (TOP2)-targeting poisons such as anthracyclines and etoposide are commonly used for
cancer chemotherapy and kill tumor cells by causing accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). Several
lines of evidence indicate that overexpression of TOP2A, the gene encoding topoisomerase IIa, increases
sensitivity of tumor cells to TOP2 poisons, but it is not clear why some TOP2A-overexpressing (TOP2A-High)
tumors respond poorly to these drugs. In this study, we identiﬁed that TOP2A expression is induced by DLX4, a
homeoprotein that is overexpressed in breast and ovarian cancers. Analysis of breast cancer datasets revealed
that TOP2A-high cases that also highly expressed DLX4 responded more poorly to anthracycline-based
chemotherapy than TOP2A-high cases that expressed DLX4 at low levels. Overexpression of TOP2A alone in
tumor cells increased the level of DSBs induced by TOP2 poisons. In contrast, DLX4 reduced the level of TOP2
poison-induced DSBs irrespective of its induction of TOP2A. DLX4 did not stimulate homologous recombination–
mediated repair of DSBs. However, DLX4 interacted with Ku proteins, stimulated DNA-dependent protein kinase
activity, and increased erroneous end-joining repair of DSBs. Whereas DLX4 did not reduce levels of TOP2
poison-induced DSBs in Ku-deﬁcient cells, DLX4 stimulated DSB repair and reduced the level of TOP2 poison–
induced DSBs when Ku was reconstituted in these cells. Our ﬁndings indicate that DLX4 induces TOP2A
expression but reduces sensitivity of tumor cells to TOP2 poisons by stimulating Ku-dependent repair of DSBs.
These opposing activities of DLX4 could explain why some TOP2A-overexpressing tumors are not highly sensitive
to TOP2 poisons. Cancer Res; 73(2); 1000–10. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are the most lethal form of
DNA damage and are primarily repaired by 2 pathways. The
homologous recombination (HR) pathway is a high-ﬁdelity
repair mechanism that uses the sister chromatid as a template.
The canonical nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway is
initiated by the binding of Ku heterodimers to DNA ends,
which recruit the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein
kinase (DNA-PK) to form a complex that enables ligation of
DNA ends with little or no homology (1, 2). Cells that are
defective in the HR or NHEJ pathways are highly sensitive to
poisons that target topoisomerase II (TOP2; refs. 3–6). TOP2 is
an enzyme that induces transient DSBs to relieve torsional
stress imposed on DNA during replication (7). Of the 2 mam-

malian TOP2 isoforms, TOP2a is essential for cell growth (7).
TOP2 poisons such as etoposide and anthracyclines (e.g.,
doxorubicin and epirubicin) are commonly used as anti-cancer
drugs. TOP2 poisons trap the enzyme in a complex with DNA at
a step after DSBs have occurred, thereby causing DSBs to
accumulate to lethal levels (8). Experimental studies have
shown that overexpressing TOP2a in cells increases TOP2
poison–induced cell death, whereas downregulating TOP2a
decreases sensitivity (9–11). On the other hand, there have
been conﬂicting studies about the clinical value of TOP2a in
predicting responsiveness to TOP2 poisons. The TOP2A gene
that encodes TOP2a maps to 17q21-22, a region that is
ampliﬁed in about 12% of breast and ovarian cancers (12,
13). Whereas several studies have reported that TOP2A ampliﬁcation identiﬁes patients with cancer who respond favorably
to anthracycline-based chemotherapy (13, 14), others have
found the TOP2A status has no predictive value (15–17).
However, a molecular explanation for the discordance between
these experimental and clinical studies has not been identiﬁed.
Homeobox genes constitute a gene superfamily encoding
transcription factors (often termed homeoproteins) that control developmental patterning (18–20). Increasing evidence
indicates that aberrant expression of many homeobox genes
in tumors deregulates cell proliferation and cell survival (19,
20). For example, the homeobox gene CDX2 inhibits cell
proliferation and is downregulated in many colon cancers

DLX4 Induces TOP2a but Reduces Sensitivity to TOP2 Poisons

(21, 22). Overexpression of SIX1 in ovarian cancers confers
resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (23), whereas loss of
BARX2 in ovarian cancers is associated with cisplatin resistance (24). However, only few bona ﬁde transcriptional targets
of homeoproteins have been identiﬁed, and the mechanisms of
these regulatory factors in tumorigenesis remain poorly
understood.
The DLX4 gene (also reported as DLX7, BP1) is a member of
the DLX family of homeobox genes that controls diverse
developmental processes including skeletal patterning and
neurogenesis (25). DLX4 is absent from most normal adult
tissues but is frequently expressed in breast and ovarian
cancers (26, 27) and also in lung cancers and leukemias (28,
29). We previously identiﬁed that DLX4 inhibits gene responses
that are central to the TGF-b cytostatic program (30) and also
stimulates tumor angiogenesis by inducing expression of
ﬁbroblast growth factor-2 and VEGF (27). Others have found
that DLX4 is more highly expressed in a doxorubicin-resistant
subclone of MCF-7 breast cancer cells than in the parental cell
line (26), raising the possibility that DLX4 also modulates
sensitivity to speciﬁc chemotherapeutic agents. In this study,
we identiﬁed that TOP2A is a transcriptional target of DLX4 but
that induction of TOP2A by DLX4 is not associated with
increased sensitivity to TOP2 poisons. DLX4 was found to
interact with Ku proteins, stimulate Ku-dependent repair of
DSBs, and reduce levels of DSBs induced by TOP2 poisons.
These apparently opposing activities of DLX4 could explain
why some tumors have elevated TOP2A expression but are not
sensitive to TOP2 poisons.

purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Plasmids
All short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) and cDNAs encoding Ku80
and TOP2a–GFP fusion protein were purchased from OriGene
Technology. pUC19 plasmid was purchased from Invitrogen.
BRCA1 and I-SceI plasmids (31) and full-length and truncated
DLX4 expression plasmids (30) have been previously described.
pGL2 plasmids containing wild-type TOP2A promoter
sequences were provided by William Beck (University of
Illinois, Chicago, IL). The motif ATATAAAAG in the TOP2A
promoter (nucleotides 127 to 119) was mutated to ACAGAGACG by using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies).
Cell lines
Parental MDA-MB-468 and XR-V15B cells, authenticated by
short tandem repeat (STR) analysis, were purchased from

www.aacrjournals.org

American Type Culture Collection and passaged within 6
months of receipt. Parental TOV112D cells (provided by JuSeog Lee, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) and
U2OS cells were also tested by STR analysis. The stable þDLX4
MDA-MB-468 and U2OS DR-GFP reporter cell lines are
described in our previous studies (30, 31). Cell lines were
cultured in the following media supplemented with 10% FBS
and penicillin/streptomycin: MDA-MB-468 (RPMI-1640),
U2OS (McCoys 5A), XR-V15B [Dulbeccos' Modiﬁed Eagles'
Media (DMEM)], and TOV112D (1:1 mixture of MCDB 105
medium and Medium 199). Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) was used for transfecting cell lines.
Cell viability and cell death assays
Cells were plated in 96-well plates (2,000/well) and incubated for 2 days with drugs at concentrations ranging from 104 to
104 mmol/L. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay (Roche).
IC50 values were calculated from the average of dose–response
curves obtained in 3 independent experiments. Cell death was
measured by assaying mono- and oligonucleosomes in cell
lysates by using Cell Death Detection ELISA (Roche).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase
reporter assays
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were conducted by using the ChIP Assay Kit (Upstate Biotechnology).
Sheared chromatin was incubated with DLX4 Ab and DNA
puriﬁed from precipitated protein–DNA complexes. A 375-bp
fragment of the TOP2A promoter was ampliﬁed by using the
following primers: forward, 50 -GAAGCTAAGGCTCCCATTCC30 ; reverse, 50 -CGTCCAGAAGAACCAATCGT-30 . As a negative
control, a 166-bp glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) fragment was ampliﬁed using the following primers:
forward, 50 -TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG-30 ; reverse, 50 -TCGAACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA-30 . Cells were cotransfected
with pGL2 ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter plasmids and with pRLCMV Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) for normalizing transfection efﬁciency. Luciferase activities were
assayed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay Kit
(Promega).
Comet assay
DSBs were measured by neutral comet assay using the
Comet Assay Kit (Trevigen). Comet images were captured by
ﬂuorescence microscopy. Tail moments (percentage of DNA in
tail  tail length) were quantiﬁed using CometScore software
(www.autocomet.com). For each cell line, 3 independent
assays were conducted where comet tails were analyzed in a
minimum of 50 randomly selected cells in each assay.
HR assay
Cells of the U2OS DR-GFP reporter cell line were transfected
with I-SceI plasmid to generate a DSB within the SceGFP
reporter gene. At 1 day thereafter, cells were transfected with
empty vector, DLX4, or BRCA1 plasmids and cultured for 2
days. Repair of the DSB was assayed by PCR and ﬂow cytometric analysis of GFP ﬂuorescence intensity as previously
described (31).

Nonidet P-40, 2 mmol/L EDTA. DNA-PK assays were conducted by using the SignaTECT DNA-PK Assay System
(Promega).
Bioinformatic analysis
DLX4 and TOP2A transcript levels in tumors were analyzed
in publicly available gene expression datasets as described in
Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted using STATISTICA6 software (StatSoft Inc.). Statistical signiﬁcance of data was
assessed by 2-tailed Student t test unless noted otherwise.
Data represent mean  SD. Signiﬁcance of differences in gene
expression between groups of patients was assessed by Mann–
Whitney U test. Fisher exact test was used for evaluating
differences in response rates between groups. P > 0.05 was
considered not signiﬁcant.

Results
DLX4 overexpression in tumor cells selectively decreases
TOP2 poison sensitivity
Increasing evidence indicates that various homeobox genes
modulate responsiveness of cells to diverse antiproliferative
and apoptotic signals (23, 24, 30). We initially investigated the
possibility that DLX4 modulates the sensitivity of tumor cells
to commonly used chemotherapeutic agents by using a MDAMB-468 breast cancer cell line that we transduced with DLX4 in
earlier studies (30). Expression of DLX4 signiﬁcantly reduced
sensitivity of MDA-MB-468 cells to doxorubicin (P ¼ 0.005) but
did not alter sensitivity to paclitaxel (microtubule disruptor), 5ﬂuorouracil (pyrimidine analogue), or cyclophosphamide
(alkylating agent; Supplementary Table SI). Similar results
were obtained when DLX4 was overexpressed in U2OS osteosarcoma cells (Supplementary Table SI). These ﬁndings suggest that DLX4 overexpression selectively decreases TOP2
poison sensitivity.
DLX4 induces TOP2A promoter activity and TOP2a levels
Because downregulation of TOP2a has been reported to
reduce sensitivity to TOP2 poisons (10, 11), we evaluated
whether DLX4 inhibits TOP2a expression. Contrary to our
expectation, enforced expression of DLX4 induced TOP2a
levels (Fig. 1A). Conversely, TOP2a levels decreased when
endogenous DLX4 was knocked down by shRNAs that targeted
2 different sites in DLX4 but were not affected by nontargeting
shRNA (Fig. 1B). When breast cancer cases in 2 independent
cohorts were stratiﬁed according to expression of DLX4 in
tumors, levels of TOP2A transcripts were found to be significantly higher in DLX4-high than in DLX4-low tumors in each of
these cohorts [the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, P ¼
0.0001; Van de Vijver dataset (32), P ¼ 0.0012; Fig. 1C]. TOP2A
transcript levels were also higher in DLX4-high than in DLX4low tumors in TCGA datasets of ovarian and lung cancers
(ovarian cancers, P ¼ 0.022; lung cancers, P ¼ 0.028; Supplementary Fig. S1). Because homeoproteins are thought to
function as transcription factors (18), we evaluated the effect
of DLX4 on TOP2A promoter activity in luciferase reporter
assays. DLX4 stimulated TOP2A promoter activity through a
region located between positions 162 and 90 relative to the
transcription start site (P ¼ 0.006; Fig. 1D). Binding of endogenous DLX4 to this region was detected by ChIP (Fig. 1E). An
AT-rich motif located within the responsive region is homologous to the DLX4-binding site in the b-globin promoter that is
the only well-characterized target of DLX4 (33). Mutation of the
AT-rich motif signiﬁcantly reduced the ability of DLX4 to
stimulate TOP2A promoter activity (P ¼ 0.004; Fig. 1D).
Together, our ﬁndings indicate that TOP2A is a transcriptional
target of DLX4 but that DLX4 reduces TOP2 poison sensitivity
irrespective of its induction of TOP2A.
DLX4 is associated with reduced responsiveness to
anthracycline-based chemotherapy
Several studies have published datasets of transcriptional
proﬁles of breast cancers linked to outcomes following anthracycline chemotherapy in combination with 5-ﬂuorouracil,
cyclophosphamide, and/or a taxane (34–37). Because DLX4

DLX4 Induces TOP2a but Reduces Sensitivity to TOP2 Poisons

DLX4-overexpressing MDA-MB-468 and U2OS cell lines (A) and TOV112D cells transfected with empty vector, nontargeting shRNA and shRNAs targeting
2 different sites of DLX4 (shA-DLX4 and shB-DLX4; B). C, breast cancer cases from the TCGA project (n ¼ 537) and study of Van de Vijver and
colleagues (ref. 32; n ¼ 295) were stratiﬁed according to DLX4 expression in tumors, where DLX4 transcript levels in each dataset were deﬁned as high
(> upper quartile) and low (< lower quartile). Signiﬁcance of differences in TOP2A transcript levels (log2 scale) between upper and lower quartile subgroups was
evaluated by Mann–Whitney U test. D, U2OS cells that lacked DLX4 (white bar) or expressed DLX4 (black bar) were transfected with pGL2 luciferase
reporter plasmids containing the indicated regions of the TOP2A promoter. Wild-type (capitals) and mutated (small case) sequences of the DLX4-binding site
(white box) are indicated. Shown are average relative luciferase activities of 3 independent experiments. E, detection of binding of endogenous DLX4 to the

did not affect sensitivity of tumor cells to 5-ﬂuorouracil,
cyclophosphamide, or paclitaxel (Supplementary Table SI), we
analyzed 4 independent breast cancer datasets to gain insight
into the relationship between DLX4 and TOP2A expression and
anthracycline sensitivity. Cases in each cohort were classiﬁed
into groups according to levels of DLX4 and TOP2A transcripts
in tumors. Response rates of a given group were found to be
consistent across all 4 cohorts (Table 1). Because the sizes of
several groups were too small to compare in an individual
cohort, response rates were compared between groups of cases
from the 4 cohorts combined. The response rate was higher in
the TOP2A-high group than in the TOP2A-low group (P ¼
0.00001; Table 1). However, the response rate was lower in the
subgroup of TOP2A-high cases that were also DLX4-high than
in the subgroup of TOP2A-high cases that were DLX4-low (P ¼
0.043; Table 1). These ﬁndings raise the possibility that TOP2Ahigh tumors that also highly express DLX4 respond to anthracyclines more poorly than TOP2A-high tumors that have low
levels of DLX4 expression.

DLX4 reduces DSBs and cell death induced by TOP2
poisons
To determine whether tumor cells that highly express both
TOP2A and DLX4 are less sensitive to TOP2 poisons than tumor
cells that highly express TOP2A but not DLX4, we initially
evaluated levels of doxorubicin-induced cell death in MDAMB-468 cells in which TOP2a alone was overexpressed (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and in which TOP2a was induced by
DLX4 (Fig. 1A). As compared with vector control cells, cell
death was increased in cells that overexpressed TOP2a alone
(P ¼ 0.005) but was reduced in cells that overexpressed DLX4
(P ¼ 0.009; Fig. 2A). To conﬁrm our ﬁndings, we evaluated cell
death in TOV112D ovarian cancer cells in which TOP2a was
knocked down by TOP2A shRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S2B)
and in which TOP2a was downregulated by DLX4 knockdown
(Fig. 1B). Doxorubicin-induced cell death was reduced when
TOP2a was knocked down by TOP2A shRNAs (P ¼ 0.02) but
was increased when DLX4 was knocked down (P ¼ 0.009; Fig.
2B). Similar results were obtained when TOV112D cells were

treated with etoposide (Fig. 2B). As compared with vector
control MDA-MB-468 cells, higher levels of doxorubicininduced DSBs were detected by neutral comet assays in
MDA-MB-468 cells that overexpressed TOP2a (P ¼ 0.006),
whereas lower levels were detected in cells that overexpressed
DLX4 (P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 2C). Conversely, levels of DSBs were
reduced in TOV112D cells when TOP2a was knocked down
(P ¼ 0.008) but were increased when DLX4 was knocked down

notwithstanding its induction of TOP2a, inhibits TOP2 poison–induced cell death by reducing accumulation of DSBs.

DLX4 Induces TOP2a but Reduces Sensitivity to TOP2 Poisons

HR-mediated repair of DSBs, we used a U2OS cell line that
stably expresses a DR-GFP reporter cassette. Transient expression of the restriction enzyme I-SceI in this cell line induces a
DSB within the SceGFP gene. Repair of the DSB by HR is
facilitated by using the adjacent iGFP gene (encoding a truncated GFP) as a template and results in restoration of GFP
expression by the SceGFP gene (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Restoration of GFP expression (measured as percentage of
GFPþ cells) was compared when DLX4 and BRCA1, a wellcharacterized regulator of HR, were expressed in the reporter
cell line (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Restoration of GFP expression was markedly increased by BRCA1 (from 5.3% to 17.1%
GFPþ cells) but not by DLX4 (from 5.3% to 5.9% GFPþ cells;
Supplementary Fig. S3C). PCR ampliﬁcation was conducted to
conﬁrm increased repair of the SceGFP gene in cells when
BRCA1 but not DLX4 was overexpressed (Supplementary Fig.
S3D). These ﬁndings indicate that DLX4 does not stimulate
HR-mediated repair of DSBs.
Whereas HR is a high-ﬁdelity repair mechanism, repair of
DSBs by end-joining is error-prone (1, 2). To investigate the
effect of DLX4 on end-joining, nuclear extracts of vector

control U2OS cells and U2OS cells that expressed FLAG-tagged
DLX4 (þDLX4) were assayed for the ability to rejoin an EcoRIcut DSB within the lacZ gene of pUC19 plasmid DNA. Frequency and efﬁcacy of plasmid repair were measured by the
formation of blue colonies (correct repair) and white colonies
(misrepair) following transformation of E. coli (Fig. 3A). As
compared with vector control U2OS extracts, extracts of
þDLX4 U2OS cells exhibited an overall increase in repair
activity, but this increase was due to a higher frequency of
misrepair (P ¼ 0.004; Fig. 3B). This increase in misrepair was
inhibited when extracts were depleted of FLAG-tagged DLX4
by using antibodies to FLAG (P ¼ 0.005; Fig. 3C). To conﬁrm
that DLX4 stimulates erroneous repair, we sequenced pUC19
DNA isolated from individual white colonies. Representative
examples of sequences surrounding the EcoRI-cut DSB and
tracts of nucleotide microhomology identiﬁed around breakpoint junctions are shown in Supplementary Fig. S4A. As
compared with assays using vector control U2OS extracts, the
size of deletions surrounding the DSB were signiﬁcantly larger
in assays using þDLX4 U2OS extracts (P ¼ 0.009; Fig. 3D). To
conﬁrm our ﬁndings, we conducted end-joining assays using

extracts of TOV112D cells that were transfected with nontargeting and DLX4-speciﬁc shRNAs. Knockdown of endogenous
DLX4 reduced the frequency of misrepair (P ¼ 0.018; Fig. 3E)
and also reduced the size of deletions surrounding the DSB
(P ¼ 0.007; Fig. 3F; Supplementary Fig. S4B). These ﬁndings
indicate that DLX4 stimulates erroneous end-joining repair of
DSBs.
DLX4 interacts with the NHEJ machinery and stimulates
DNA-PK activity
To determine the mechanism by which DLX4 stimulates
end-joining repair, we initially evaluated the effect of DLX4 on
expression of components of the canonical NHEJ machinery.
DLX4 did not alter expression levels of Ku70 (also known as
XRCC6), Ku80 (also known as XRCC5, Ku86), DNA-PKcs,
XRCC4, or DNA ligase IV (Fig. 4A). DLX4 also did not affect
interactions between Ku70 and Ku80 (Fig. 4B). Furthermore,
DLX4 neither affected binding of Ku proteins to DNA ends nor
the interaction of DNA-PKcs with Ku-DNA complexes (Fig. 4C).
On the other hand, DLX4 increased DNA-PK activity (P ¼
0.011; Fig. 4D). Interaction of FLAG-tagged DLX4 with DNAPKcs was not detected in the absence of DNA and only weakly
detected in the presence of DNA (Fig. 4E). However, interactions of FLAG-tagged DLX4 with Ku70 and with Ku80 were
strongly detected both in the absence and presence of DNA
(Fig. 4E). Interactions of endogenous DLX4 with these NHEJ
proteins were conﬁrmed in immunoprecipitation assays using
extracts of TOV112D cells (Fig. 4F). We compared the abilities
of full-length and truncated FLAG-tagged DLX4 proteins to
interact with Ku70 and Ku80 (Fig. 4G). The N-terminal transcriptional activation (TA) domain of DLX4 did not interact
with Ku70 or Ku80 (Fig. 4H). However, deletion of the DNAbinding homeodomain of DLX4 (DLX4-DHD) abolished Kubinding ability (Fig. 4H), indicating that DLX4 interacts with Ku
proteins through its homeodomain. As compared with vector
control U2OS cells, error-prone end-joining was signiﬁcantly
increased in U2OS cells that expressed full-length DLX4 (P ¼
0.004) but not in cells that expressed the DLX4-DHD form (Fig.
4I). These ﬁndings indicate that DLX4 interacts with Ku
proteins and stimulates DNA-PK activity and that the ability
of DLX4 to stimulate end-joining repair of DSBs depends on its
interaction with Ku proteins.
The ability of DLX4 to reduce levels of TOP2 poison–
induced DSBs is Ku dependent
In subsequent experiments, we investigated whether the
ability of DLX4 to reduce levels of TOP2 poison–induced DSBs
is due to its stimulation of Ku-dependent NHEJ activity. We
ﬁrst evaluated the effect of DLX4 on end-joining repair of DSBs
in Ku-deﬁcient cells. Cells of the Ku80-deﬁcient cell line XRV15B (38) were transfected with Ku80 and/or DLX4 (Fig. 5A).
Very little end-joining activity was detected in vector control
XR-V15B cells (Fig. 5B). Reconstitution of Ku80 in XR-V15B
cells increased end-joining activity (P ¼ 0.02), but expression of
DLX4 alone had no stimulatory effect (Fig. 5B). In contrast,
DLX4 increased end-joining activity in XR-V15B cells that were
reconstituted with Ku80 (P ¼ 0.003; Fig. 5B). Expression of
DLX4 alone in XR-V15B cells did not reduce the levels of DSBs

1006

Cancer Res; 73(2) January 15, 2013

induced by doxorubicin (Fig. 5C). However, signiﬁcantly lower
levels of doxorubicin-induced DSBs were detected when DLX4
was expressed in XR-V15B cells that were reconstituted with
Ku80 (P ¼ 0.004; Fig. 5C). Together, our ﬁndings support a
model in which DLX4 induces TOP2A expression but reduces
levels of TOP2 poison–induced DSBs by interacting with Ku
proteins and stimulating Ku-dependent end-joining repair of
DSBs.

Discussion
TOP2A has been the most extensively studied gene for
determining responsiveness to TOP2 poisons, but there have
been conﬂicting studies about its clinical value as a predictive
marker (13–17). Reasons that have been proposed to explain
this discordance include differences in techniques that evaluated the TOP2A status in tumors and the possible importance
of co-ampliﬁcation of HER2 (17). In this study, we identiﬁed
that TOP2A is a transcriptional target of DLX4, a homeoprotein
that is overexpressed in various types of tumors including
breast and ovarian cancers. Our study supports prior experimental evidence that overexpression of TOP2A alone
enhances sensitivity of cells to TOP2 poisons whereas downregulating TOP2A increases resistance (9–11). However, notwithstanding its induction of TOP2A, DLX4 inhibited levels of
TOP2 poison–induced DSBs and cell death. These apparently
opposing activities of DLX4 might provide a molecular explanation as to why some tumors have elevated levels of TOP2A
expression but respond poorly to TOP2 poisons.
The importance of NHEJ in repairing TOP2 poison–induced
DNA damage has been supported by several studies. NHEJdeﬁcient cells are highly sensitive to TOP2 poisons (3, 6) and
inhibition of DNA-PK activity increases sensitivity to TOP2
poisons (5). Our studies showed that DLX4 does not stimulate
HR-mediated DSB repair but interacts with Ku proteins and
stimulates end-joining repair of DSBs in a Ku-dependent
manner. DLX4 did not stimulate end-joining in the absence
of its Ku-interacting domain. Whereas levels of end-joining
activity and TOP2 poison–induced DSBs were not affected by
DLX4 in Ku-deﬁcient cells, DLX4 stimulated DSB repair and
reduced the level of TOP2 poison–induced DSBs when Ku was
reconstituted in these cells. These results support a model in
which DLX4 inhibits accumulation of TOP2 poison–induced
DSBs by stimulating the canonical NHEJ pathway but not
alternate Ku-independent end-joining pathways (2). DNAPKcs is activated when recruited to DNA-bound Ku complexes
(1). Because DLX4 neither stimulated expression of NHEJ
components, Ku70-Ku80 dimerization, the binding of Ku proteins to DNA nor the interaction of DNA-PKcs with Ku-DNA
complexes, it is as yet unclear how DLX4 stimulates DNA-PK
activity. Because DLX4 can bind Ku proteins in the absence of
DNA, it is possible that this binding induces conformational
changes in Ku-DNA complexes that enhance DNA-PK activity.
This suggests that DLX4 stimulates DNA repair in a nontranscriptional capacity. There is evidence that some homeoproteins have nontranscriptional functions (39, 40). However, the
possibility that DLX4 might also regulate transcription of genes
that control DNA-PK activity cannot at this present time be
excluded.

DLX4 Induces TOP2a but Reduces Sensitivity to TOP2 Poisons

interactions of endogenous DLX4 with Ku proteins and DNA-PKcs were assayed by immunoprecipitation in TOV112D extracts (not treated with benzonase).
G, Western blot analysis of FLAG-tagged proteins containing full-length DLX4 (FL), transactivation domain (TA), homeodomain (HD), and C-terminal tail (C)

formation in end-joining assays using extracts of U2OS cells that were transfected with empty vector, full-length DLX4, and a truncated form lacking the

Several other homeoproteins, such as CDX2 and HOXB7,
have been reported to interact with Ku proteins (41, 42).
Interestingly, CDX2 inhibits DNA repair in intestinal cells
(41). HOXB7 has been reported to stimulate DNA repair
(42), but it is not known whether HOXB7 promotes correct

or erroneous repair. An intriguing ﬁnding of our study is that
DLX4 increases both the frequency and magnitude of erroneous end-joining. NHEJ depends on DNA ends being held in
alignment and in proximity for end-processing and ligation to
occur (1). Ku proteins not only serve as "scaffolding" proteins to

bring DNA ends together but also have lyase activity (43). DLX4
did not block ligation but caused larger deletions at breakpoint
junctions. The interaction of DLX4 with Ku proteins might
alter alignment of DNA ends and also end-processing. On the
other hand, it is possible that binding of CDX2 to Ku proteins
sterically blocks alignment or processing of DNA ends so that
ligation does not occur. The opposite effects of DLX4 and CDX2
on end-joining might be due to different conformational
changes in Ku-DNA complexes.
An implication of our ﬁnding that DLX4 increases endjoining inﬁdelity is that DLX4 overexpression in tumor cells
might promote genomic instability. The role of NHEJ in
maintaining genomic stability is unclear. Deﬁciency in NHEJ
components has been reported to increase chromosomal
aberrations (44, 45), but NHEJ has also been found to promote
genomic rearrangements (46). We observed large deletions in
end-joining assays using control TOV112D cells (Fig. 3F). This
suggests that TOV112D cells have constitutively overactive
NHEJ and is consistent with ﬁndings that this cell line has

1008

Cancer Res; 73(2) January 15, 2013

numerous chromosomal aberrations (47). Several studies indicate that error-prone repair is increased in tumors. Leukemic
cells exhibit higher NHEJ activity and misrepair frequency than
normal hematopoietic cells (48, 49). CDX2 inhibits end-joining
in intestinal cells and is downregulated in colon cancers
(22, 41). The susceptibility of Cdx2þ/ mice to intestinal cancer
has been attributed, in part, to increased genomic instability
(21). Conversely, DLX4 stimulates erroneous end-joining and is
overexpressed in tumors. Because the precise functions of
DLX4 in normal development are not known, it is not clear
how its DNA repair activity is related to its developmental
functions. One possibility is that the ability of DLX4 to stimulate repair of DSBs might have evolved as a protective
mechanism against the potentially lethal effects of its induction of TOP2a.
The DLX4 and TOP2A genes are both located on 17q21-22
region, a region that is ampliﬁed in about 12% of breast and
ovarian cancers (12, 13). However, DLX4 levels are elevated in
more than 50% of breast and ovarian cancers (26, 27), indicating that DLX4 overexpression is not solely due to gene
ampliﬁcation. TOP2a levels in breast cancers also do not
correlate with TOP2A gene copy number (50). The frequency
of co-ampliﬁcation of DLX4 and TOP2A is not known, but coampliﬁcation might account for elevated expression of both
genes in a subset of tumors. Our ﬁndings that DLX4 induces
TOP2a levels could explain, at least in part, why TOP2a levels
are elevated in tumors in which the TOP2A gene is not
ampliﬁed. Deletion of TOP2A also occurs in 6% to 14% of
breast cancers (13, 14, 16) and could explain why a subset of
tumors that highly express DLX4 have low TOP2A mRNA levels.
TOP2a levels are regulated by other mechanisms in addition to
transcription (17). Further investigation of TOP2a protein
levels in tumors is therefore needed. On the basis of our
ﬁndings, evaluation of DLX4 levels in tumors that have elevated
TOP2a protein levels but respond poorly to TOP2 poisons
warrants further investigation.
In summary, our study identiﬁes 2 opposing activities of
DLX4 in inducing TOP2A expression and stimulating repair of
DSBs that could explain why some TOP2A-overexpressing
tumors respond poorly to TOP2 poisons. Our study also
supports increasing evidence that homeoproteins confer survival advantages to tumor cells by diverse mechanisms. Further studies of DLX4 and other homeoproteins that control
DNA repair and cell survival could provide important insights
into predicting responsiveness of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents.
