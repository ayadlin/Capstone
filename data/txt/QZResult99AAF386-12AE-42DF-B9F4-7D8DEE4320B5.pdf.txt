Metastatic Basal Cell Carcinoma in the Era of Hedgehog
Signaling Pathway Inhibitors
Glen J. Weiss, MD1,2 and Ronald L. Korn, MD, PhD3

BACKGROUND: Inhibition of the hedgehog signaling pathway (HHSP) for the treatment of locally advanced basal cell carcinoma
(BCC) and metastatic BCC (mBCC) has produced promising results. Typically, mBCC is not taken into consideration during the
workup of a patient with multifocal metastatic disease who has a history of BCC. The objective of the current review, in which the
authors evaluated the time from the first BCC diagnosis to metastasis, location of disease, and radiographic features, was to contribute to the general knowledge and awareness among providers, patients, and support groups about mBCC and to provide an outlook
for the future of treatments for mBCC. A literature review on mBCC and a review of records from patients with mBCC who presented
to Virginia G. Piper Cancer Center Clinical Trials (an oncology clinical trials center) were conducted. The clinical and radiographic findings of 22 patients with mBCC who were evaluated at that center from the initiation of smoothened (SMO) antagonist trials were analyzed along with a review of BCC epidemiology and pathogenesis, the HHSP, and current and future treatments for this rare
presentation of the most common malignancy. The results indicated that, in the last 5 years, there has been a plethora of new
agents targeting SMO, a key component of the HHSP that, for the majority of patients with mBCC, may be a good match for targeting tumor genetic vulnerability. Like with other targeted therapy for uncommon malignancies, such as chronic myelogenous
leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, the authors anticipate that there will be clinical development of next-generation
HHSP inhibitors to combat mBCCs that are nonresponsive to or progress on current SMO antagonists. Cancer 2012;118:5310-9.

INTRODUCTION
In the last several years, inhibition of the hedgehog signaling pathway (HHSP) for the treatment of locally advanced basal
cell carcinoma (BCC) and metastatic BCC (mBCC) has led to a potential revolutionary change in how advanced BCC is
treated. Patients with unresectable and/or mBCC are now personally seeking or being referred for clinical trial evaluation
involving inhibitors of smoothened (SMO). Whereas BCC of the skin is the most common malignancy with over 1.4 million cases per year in the United States alone,1-3 mBCC is rare with an estimated incidence of <0.003% to 0.5%.4
Consideration of mBCC often is not included in the typical workup of a patient with multifocal metastatic disease
who has a history of BCC. It is our hope that the current review, which includes evaluation of the timing from first BCC
to metastasis, disease location, and radiographic features of the patients, will contribute to general knowledge about
mBCC and awareness among providers, patients, and support groups along with providing an outlook for the future of
treating mBCC. This review focuses on the clinical and radiographic findings in 22 patients with mBCC who were evaluated at an oncology clinical trials center after the advent of clinical trials with a SMO antagonist, along with a discussion
of BCC epidemiology and pathogenesis, the HHSP, and current and future treatments for this rare presentation of the
most common malignancy.
Basal Cell Carcinoma Overview

BCC is the most common malignancy and is a skin cancer. It is believed that BCC originates from the basal layer of the
epidermis, the interfollicular epidermis, and the hair follicle. By using mouse models, investigators demonstrated that
multiple epithelial compartments in skin can form BCC-like tumors, and the subtype of BCC can be manipulated,
depending on which epithelial compartment is altered.5 It is estimated that approximately 65% to 75% of nonmelanoma
skin cancer treated in the United States is BCC1,2; and, in 2006, 2.2 million nonmelanoma skin cancers were treated.3

Metastatic Basal Cell Carcinoma/Weiss and Korn

Approximately 95% of individuals are diagnosed
with BCC between ages 40 and 79 years.6 BCC is much
more common in Caucasians than individuals of African
descent or dark-skinned populations.6 The incidence is
approximately 30% higher in men than in women.7
Close to 90% of BCCs occur in the head and neck
region, and risk factors include fair skin pigmentation,
radiation (ultraviolet and/or ionizing), exposure to arsenic
or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, immunosuppression, scars, and certain genetic syndromes, such as nevoid
BCC syndrome (NBCCS).8 A previous personal history
of BCC leads to an increased risk of developing BCC in
the future. BCC rates also are higher in individuals who
live closer to the equator,7,9 in the United States, and in
other countries, such a Australia,10 in contrast to Northern European countries like Finland, which have a relatively lower incidence of BCC.11
Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome

NBCCS is a rare, autosomal-dominant, multisystem disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 57,000 to 256,000 individuals. It results from germline mutations in the Patched
gene (PTCH1) located on chromosome 9q22.3.12,13 Not
all patients with NBCCS have detectable PTCH1 mutations, suggesting the presence of mutations in other components of the HHSP.14 NBCCS is more common in
Caucasians but has been reported in individuals of African12 and Asian decent.15 Characterized by a wide range
of developmental abnormalities and a predisposition to
neoplasms, the main clinical manifestations of NBCCS
include early onset of multiple BCCs (median age, 20
years),12 odontogenic keratocysts of the mandible, palmar
and plantar pitting, craniofacial anomalies, and skeletal
abnormalities.13 Approximately 5% to 10% of individuals with NBCCS may develop medulloblastoma.13 An
individual with NBCCS may have hundreds to thousands
of BCCs treated, yet their life expectancy does not differ
much from that of individuals without NBCCS.13
A diagnosis of NBCCS requires satisfactory clinical
evidence of either 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor
criteria.16 The radiographic diagnostic workup for
NBCCS may include the following: a skull x-ray or
computed tomography (CT) scan to identify calcified falx
cerebri16; panoramic films to identify odontogenic keratocysts17; and chest, hand, and/or foot x-rays to identify
other skeletal abnormalities.16
Basal Cell Carcinoma Aggressiveness: Histology
Dependent

Many histologic variants of BCC have been characterized.
Two main categories exist that subdivide BCC by their
Cancer

aggressiveness. BCCs with nonaggressive growth patterns
include nodular, superficial, and adnexal variants; whereas
BCC with aggressive growth patterns include metatypical/
basosquamous, morpheaform, infiltrating, sclerosing, and
micronodular variants.6,18,19 It is noteworthy that, in
mouse models, postnatal induction of the glioblastoma
protein 2 (GLI2) activator in telogen follicle stem cells
leads to the development of nodular BCC-like skin
tumors.5 However, when the GLI2 activator is induced in
the interfollicular epidermis or epidermis from hairless
skin, superficial BCC-like tumors arise.5 In contrast to superficial BCCs, the hair follicle is a potential site of origin
for nodular BCC in mice.5 In addition, the level of GLI2
activator can drive the development of nodular BCC-like
tumors.5
Human BCC may also contain an admixture of histologies that fit into both growth pattern categories.
Nearly all mixed category BCC originate in the head and
neck region.18 Because there are mixed category BCC in
humans and hair follicle stem cell progeny migrate into
the epidermis during wound healing, murine models suggest an explanation of this with the possibility of nodular
BCC tumors expanding upward to involve the epidermis
as a superficial BCC.5 Detailed description and images of
distinct features of BCC variants are beyond the scope of
this review.6,8,19
In recurrent mixed category BCCs, it is the aggressive growth pattern variant that appears to predominate
the patient’s disease course.18 The incidence of mixed category BCC can range from 11% to 43%. In >85% of
these tumors, the aggressive growth pattern features may
be unsuspected.18 In other words, it is believed that the
patient has a BCC variant with only nonaggressive growth
pattern features based on the initial histopathologic assessment. This can lead to inadequate initial therapy, resulting in recurrent BCC and causing additional morbidity.
Of the multiple modalities that can be used to treat primary BCC, each possesses differing rates of success (no
BCC recurrence). Mohs’ micrographic surgery has the
highest rate of success, with a recurrence rate up to 3.3%
rate.18
Metastatic Basal Cell Carcinoma

mBCC is exceedingly rare: The most conservative estimated rate is approximately 0.0028% or 28 cases per
1,000,000 BCC diagnoses, but the incidence has been
cited as high as 0.5%.4 Thus, annually, the most conservative estimated rate of mBCC is approximately 40 cases per
year in the United States.2,3,20 Nearly all reported cases of
mBCC have been in Caucasians, and few individuals of

a
To be considered mBCC, all 3 criteria must be met.

African or Asian decent diagnosed with mBCC have been
reported in the literature.21-23
In 1951, diagnostic criteria for mBCC were defined
by Lattes and Kessler24 (Table 1). In mBCC, squamous
features/differentiation appear to be more frequent than
in primary BCC. However, as long as there are elements
of BCC in the pathologic specimen, the diagnosis should
remain classified as mBCC rather than metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.25 mBCC can spread through subcutaneous infiltration, hematologically, or, in approximately
70% of cases, through the lymphatic system.4,27 Nearly
all histologic variants of BCC have been reported in
mBCC based on recent data from mixed category BCC18
and >80% of mBCC originate from primary BCC of the
head and neck.25 Thus, we wonder whether nonaggressive
variants may transform to aggressive histologic variants
during disease progression. We suspect that the undetected aggressive growth pattern in most mBCCs may
explain why nonaggressive histologies, such as superficial
or nodular types, have been associated with mBCC.
Future research may clarify this issue.
Features of the Metastatic Basal Cell Carcinoma
Patient Cohort

In total, 22 individuals with mBCC were evaluated
(Tables 2 and 3). The majority of these patients traveled a
distance even as much as >3300 miles (1 way). Of the 22
patients, there were 18 were men, and 10 patients had
other family members with BCCs. Five of these individuals had confirmed NBCCS. The median age at first BCC
diagnoses was approximately 43 years (range, 14-68
years). The majority of patients had primary BCC originating in the head and neck region.
Of 14 patients with primary BCC who had pathology reports that could be classified by variant, 1 patient
had nonaggressive growth pattern features (nodular), 6
patients fulfilled the mixed category classification, and 7
patients had aggressive growth pattern features. The
median time to developing mBCC was approximately 9
years (range, 1-48 years). The median age of the patients
5312

with mBCC was approximately 56 years (range, 46-89
years). Only 5 of 22 patients had no tumor or previous
treatment-related symptoms at the time of their initial
consultation. All but 1 patient had received previous
BCC-related therapy, including surgery, radiotherapy,
and/or chemotherapy. The sites of frequent mBCC
involvement included lymph nodes, lung, skin, and bone.
Other less common involved sites included pleura, liver,
and brain. These results are similar to those reported in
case series reviews (see Table 3) with a few exceptions.
Our cohort had a higher prevalence of men with mBCC
and a lower percentage with primary BCC involving the
head/face; however, this may be because of our relatively
smaller sample size. Finally, our cohort had a higher prevalence of lymph node and lung involvement, possibly
because of improved imaging modalities compared with
series reports preceding the 1990s. Imaging modalities
like CT and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron
emission tomography (PET)/CT scanning now allow for
more accurate assessment of disease extent of mBCC than
ever before.
Radiographic Findings of Metastatic Basal
Cell Carcinoma
Computerized tomography

All CT imaging features were assessed before
patients received SMO antagonist therapy. Most patients
with mBCC who were evaluated by CT scans had multiple sites of disease (Fig. 1a-f). Only a limited number
of organ systems had metastases identified, as noted in
Table 4. BCC metastases had variable appearances on CT
imaging. Individual metastatic lesions ranged in size from
a few millimeters to several centimeters. The CT densities
of the tumor lesions generally were solid, but necrosis and
cystic changes were not uncommon.
Most metastatic disease either was centered within
the skin and surrounding soft tissue and lymphatic system
or spread hematogenously to the lungs, pleura, or bone.
It is noteworthy, however, that the frequency of liver
involvement was relatively low (1 patient had multiple liver
metastases that measured approximately 1 cm in greatest
dimension, and the other patient had small-volume serosal
liver metastases) compared with lung and bone involvement. The attributes of mBCC that potentiated differential
spread by lymphatics in 1 patient or through blood circulation in another have yet to be elucidated.
Skin and soft tissue involvement fell into 3 pattern
types on CT imaging, including 1) an infiltrative pattern
with loss of adjacent soft tissue planes (N ¼ 5), 2) a nodular pattern with relatively well preserved tumor margins

(N ¼ 3), or 3) a mixed pattern (N ¼ 1). The necrosis
within lesions sometimes was observed, particularly in
tumors with a nodular pattern.
Pulmonary disease on CT scans ranged from multiple lesions (1-3 metastases) to widespread parenchymal
disease. The lesions tended to form coalescent masses in
the lungs. Most lesions had spiculated margins, especially
when they were large, whereas the smaller lesions (<1 cm
in greatest dimension) tended to be more rounded and
well defined. Central necrosis often was observed within
the larger lesions, but cavitation was rare. All pulmonary
segments were involved without a propensity for the right
or left lung. Volume loss occasionally was observed in the
setting of conglomerate lesions, suggesting a component
5314

of fibrosis and retraction. Pleural disease was noted in
18% of patients, usually in the form of moderate-to-large
effusions. Nodular pleural disease was noted in 1 patient.
Bone lesions were identified in 8 of 22 patients
(36%). Their appearance on CT scans varied from subtle
osteolytic lesions (observed only on retrospect with PET/
CT imaging in 1 patient), to mixed osteolytic and osteoblastic changes (similar to those noted in more common
tumors, such as breast cancer), to destructive processes
with a soft tissue component in 4 patients.
Lymph node involvement included predominately the
neck (N ¼ 6), axilla (N ¼ 5), and chest lymph node stations
(N ¼ 8). Multiple lymph node station involvement was common (10 of 14 patients). The lymph nodes tended to have
infiltrating margins and/or central low density on Hounsfield
CT measurements, suggesting necrosis. Hyperenhancement
was rare on contrast-enhanced CT images (N ¼ 1).
Positron emission tomography/computed
tomography imaging

All PET/CT imaging features were assessed before
patients received SMO antagonist therapy. Very little is
known about the FDG metabolic behavior of BCC metastasis. In theory, PET/CT images should be able to provide
information that is complementary to that provided by
conventional imaging techniques because of the functional
nature of PET/CT scanning and whole-body surveys for
disease. Hypermetabolic primary BCC originating in the
head and neck region has previously been reported.28
In our cohort, we noted that patients who underwent PET/CT imaging had hypermetabolic activity in
BCC lesions (Fig. 2a-e). Indeed, at least 1 hypermetabolic
lesion was observed in every patient who had a baseline
PET/CT scan before the initiation of SMO antagonist
therapy. The peak FDG activity, measured as the maximal
standardized uptake value (SUVmax), ranged from 1.9 to
16.8 (mean SUVmax, 7.3). Typically, this value was 2 to 4
times above background tissue metabolism. The distribution of FDG-avid disease within organ systems was nearly
identical to that observed on contrast-enhanced CT
images in those patients who underwent both types of
imaging examinations. However, hepatic disease was not
observed on PET/CT images in the 1 patient who had
serosal disease on a CT scan. This may be because of the
relatively small size and serosal nature of this patient’s
hepatic disease. PET/CT images tended to demonstrate
more disease in bone and soft tissues compared with contrast-enhanced CT images, likely because of whole-body
coverage with PET/CT scanning and the often subtle
changes in the osseous structures involved in bone metastasis.

Radiographic evidence of skin involvement was observed either as a single site or as multifocal sites with concurrent basal cell carcinoma involvement of a metastatic site.

Contrast-enhanced CT images tended to demonstrate more
disease in the lung, especially in lesions that measured <7
mm. Failure to detect very small lung parenchymal lesions is
a known limitation of PET/CT imaging. Nevertheless,
PET/CT screening for patients with mBCC may be helpful
to fully evaluate disease burden and to potentially measure
therapeutic response.

Staging Workup and Treatment

The tumor, lymph node, metastasis (TNM) staging system is used commonly for most malignancies. A TNM
staging system endorsed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is available.29 When possible, for
locally advanced BCC and mBCC, the TNM staging may
enable better prognostication as newer systemic treatment
modalities become commercially available and as awareness about advanced BCC increases.
Molecular Pathogenesis of Metastatic Basal
Cell Carcinoma

Similar to primary BCC and NBCCS, the main genetic
aberration in mBCC is most commonly the result of
mutations or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the tumor
suppressor PTCH1.30 In addition, mutations in smoothened (SMO) or mutations or LOH of PTCH2 also can
lead to basal cell carcinogenesis.31-33 Together, these
perturbations account for up to 95% of basal cell carcinogenesis.32,33 In addition, TP53 gene mutations are
identified in >50% of BCCs, although these probably

are related to disease progression rather than carcinogenesis.32 PTCH1, PTCH2, and SMO are all components
of the HHSP, which has several therapeutics currently in
clinical development.
The Hedgehog Signaling Pathway

Targeting of the HHSP as an anticancer therapy is a fairly
recent concept. The impetus that led to the HHSP discovery and characterization began with the initial observation
of severe holoprosencenphaly and other congenital malformations in newborn lambs after pregnant ewes consumed California corn lily (Veratrum californicum) in
1962.34 The cause of these teratogenic effects was a chemical aptly named cyclopamine.35 Whereas normal HHSP
signaling is involved in cell growth and congenital development,36,37 is has been proposed that dysregulated
HHSP signaling involves nearly 25% of malignancies.36 Ensuing research led to the demonstration that
cyclopamine or synthetic HHSP pathway inhibitors
potentially could be useful to inhibit HHSP signaling
in malignancy.38
The main ligand that activates the HHSP pathway is
Sonic.33,39,40 Signaling is initiated when Sonic binds to its
receptor, PTCH1, and inactivates it.33,39,40 A series of
events ensue, including disinhibition of the transmembrane domain protein SMO. SMO migrates to primary
cilia and enables GLI activator,41 leading to transcriptional up-regulation of target genes.42 Without HHSP
ligand signaling, PTCH1 remains activated, inhibiting
SMO, leading to GLI repressor, such that HHSP target
5316

gene transcription is blocked (for further details, see Weiss
and Von Hoff, 201033).
In cancers with PTCH1-activating and/or SMOactivating mutations, HHSP signaling is ligand-independent (Type I system) and, thus, does not require Sonic
binding to PTCH1. Tumors comprising the Type I system include BCC, medulloblastomas, and rare variants of
rhabdomyosarcoma.33,40 The HHSP ligand-dependent
autocrine cancers (Type II system) include breast, pancreas, lung, prostate, upper gastrointestinal, melanoma,
and colorectal cancers.33,40 The HHSP ligand-dependent
paracrine cancers (Type III system) include colorectal,
pancreas, and prostate cancers.33,40
For the most part, in the pre-HHSP inhibitor era,
treatment largely has been disappointing, with a median
survival of 8 months (range, 0-192 months).25 By using
cisplatin-based therapy, some individuals have enjoyed
prolonged disease-free survival.43-46
Targeting the Hedghog Signaling Pathway With
Smoothed Antagonists

Targeting the HHSP in cancer therapeutics is an active field
in drug development. Recently, vismodegib (GDC-0449)
was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for
treating BCC that has recurred after surgery or that has
advanced locally or metastasized. There are now at least 7
additional SMO antagonists in various stages of clinical trial
development, including BMS-833923, IPI-926, LDE-225,
PF-04449913, LEQ506, TAK-441, and LY2940680. The
most impressive and positive, life-altering results from these
therapeutic trials in patients with metastatic cancer have

been document in mBCC. At least 2 SMO antagonists have
undergone phase 2 evaluation in advanced BCC trials.47
The first human results in advanced/mBCC demonstrating a response to vismodegib were published in
2009.30 Overall, this agent is well tolerated with primarily
mild-to-moderate side effects, including dysguesia, hair
loss, and muscle cramps.48 Subsequently, the single-arm
phase 2 results of vismodegib in mBCC (N ¼ 33) recently
were announced, and the agent demonstrated a 30%
response rate and a median progression-free survival of
9.5 months.49 Results for LDE225, the other SMO antagonist in phase 2 trials for advanced BCC, are still too early
to report. However, in the phase 1 study, 5 patients with
advanced BCC attained at least a partial response, and at
least 2 patients were on therapy for >4 months.50
In total, 20 patients with mBCC in this cohort
(Table 2) received treatment with SMO antagonists. The
best response achieved was a partial response in 8 patients
(for a representative example, see Fig. 3a,b), stable disease
in 10 patients, and 2 patients had progressive disease as
their best response to an SMO antagonist.
Other Drugs Targeting the Hedgehog Signaling
Pathway

Other naturally occurring agents or drugs that have been
approved for the treatment other diseases have demonCancer

strated the ability to inhibit HHSP inhibition in preclinical studies.51 Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is a fat-soluble
vitamin that can inhibit SMO and has greater potency
than cyclopamine in vitro.52 In preclinical models, drugs
that inhibit GLI1 or forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1),
which are downstream of SMO, also have been reported.
By targeting downstream of SMO, in theory, mBCC
tumors that lack sensitizing genetic aberrations that would
be responsive to SMO antagonists or mBCC tumors that
develop resistance to SMO antagonists may derive benefit
from these agents. Agents that target GLI1 include
GLI antagonist 61 (GANT61)53 and arsenic trioxide.54
AY9944, a diamine substructure of GANT61 and an
inhibitor of the enzymatic activity and transcriptional
inducer of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (Dhcr7), can
attenuate HHSP signaling when there is up-regulation of
endogenous Dhcr7.55 Thus, other Dhcr7 modulators,
such as the antidepressant imipramine and antipsychotics
like clozapine, chlorpromazine, and haloperidol; can
regulate HHSP signaling.55 Itraconazole, an antifungal
agent, also inhibited GLI in a reporter assay.56 In fact, a
trial of oral or topical itraconazole in nonmetastatic BCC is
underway (National Clinical Trial NCT01108094).
Agents that target FOXM1 include thiazole antibiotics like
siomycin A and proteosome inhibitors like bortezomib.51
Statins and human 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme

Review Article

A reductase inhibitors, which are approved to prevent and
treat heart disease by lowering blood cholesterol, also were
able to reduce HHSP target gene transcription and pathwaydependent proliferation in medulloblastoma in vitro.57
In conclusion, during the last 5 years, there has been
a plethora of new agents targeting SMO, a key component
of the HHSP. For the majority of mBCCs, SMO antagonists should be a great context in which to match a
targeted agent to tumor genetic vulnerability. The emergence of disease progression in mBCC caused either by
selection for resistant tumor clones or by the development
of acquired resistance is a real clinical problem for patients
with mBCC.33,57 Like in other targeted therapies for
uncommon malignancies, such as chronic myelogenous
leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, it is likely
that next-generation HHSP inhibitors will be introduced
to combat mBCC in patients who are nonresponsive
or who progress on current SMO antagonists. With
improved awareness of mBCC, we hope that, at the least,
patients who have this very rare cancer are considered for
referral to a cancer center that is investigating SMO antagonists in mBCC or in advanced solid tumors.
