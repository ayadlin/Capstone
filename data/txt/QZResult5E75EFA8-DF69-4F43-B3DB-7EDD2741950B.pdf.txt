Abstract
5,10-Methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFS) regulates
the flow of carbon through the one-carbon metabolic network,
which supplies essential components for the growth and
proliferation of cells. Inhibition of MTHFS in human MCF-7
breast cancer cells has been shown to arrest the growth of
cells. Absence of the three-dimensional structure of human
MTHFS (hMTHFS) has hampered the rational design and
optimization of drug candidates. Here, we report the
structures of native hMTHFS, a binary complex of hMTHFS
with ADP, hMTHFS bound with the N5-iminium phosphate
reaction intermediate, and an enzyme-product complex of
hMTHFS. The N5-iminium phosphate captured for the first
time in our crystal structure unravels a unique strategy used
by hMTHFS for recognition of the substrate and provides
structural basis for the regulation of enzyme activity. Binding
of N10-substituted folate analogues places Y152 in the middle
of the channel connecting ATP binding site with the substrate
binding pocket, precluding the positioning of ;-phosphate for
a nucleophilic attack. Using the structures of hMTHFS as a
guide, we have probed the role of residues surrounding the
active site in catalysis by mutagenesis. The ensemble of
hMTHFS structures and the mutagenesis data yield a coherent
picture of the MTHFS active site, determinants of substrate
specificity, and new insights into the mechanism of inhibition
of hMTHFS. [Cancer Res 2009;69(18):7294–301]

Introduction
The folate-dependent one-carbon metabolic network supplies
carbon for the synthesis of purines, thymidine, and amino acids
(Fig. 1; refs. 1, 2). Because these components are essential for the
growth and proliferation of cells, the folate-dependent one-carbon
metabolic network is a prime target for the development of
anticancer therapeutics (3, 4). Several enzymes functioning in the
network have been targeted successfully for the treatment of
carcinomas. Methotrexate, one of the most successful antifolate to
be administered in cancer chemotherapy (5), inhibits a key enzyme

of the one-carbon metabolic network, dihydrofolate reductase,
which catalyzes the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate.
Similarly, colorectal and pancreatic cancers are routinely treated by
administration of the pyrimidine analogue 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),
which inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS; ref. 6). TS converts
deoxyuridylate to deoxythymidylate using a carbon donated by
5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (Fig. 1). This conversion is essential
for DNA synthesis (7). To increase the clinical efficiency of the
treatment, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate is often coadministered along
with 5-FU. The beneficial effect of administering 5-formyltetrahydrofolate during the therapy with 5-FU is a consequence of the
5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFS)–catalyzed
conversion of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate, which is further metabolized to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (Fig. 1). Lower levels of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
have been shown to increase the dissociation of 5-FU from the
ternary complex of TS and decrease the effectiveness of the
pyrimidine analogue (8, 9). 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate is
also synthesized by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT)
during conversion of serine to glycine. The activity of SHMT
is regulated indirectly by MTHFS because the substrate of MTHFS,
5-formyltetrahydrofolate, inhibits SHMT (10–12). Glycinamide
ribonucleotide transformylase and phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide transformylase, two other enzymes of the onecarbon network, use carbons from 10-formyltetrahydrofolate
for the synthesis of purines and have also been targeted for
the treatment of carcinomas (13, 14).
MTHFS catalyzes the initial irreversible conversion of 5formyltetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate (15). The
reaction is ATP dependent and is subject to feedback inhibition by
the product (16–18). Previous studies using nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy and isotope exchange methods have
shown that the reaction proceeds via the formation of two
intermediates (19). A nucleophilic attack by the formyl group of
5-formyltetrahydrofolate on the g-phosphate of ATP results in the
formation of the first N5-iminium phosphate intermediate. This
part of the reaction is reversible. The second nucleophilic attack is
intramolecular and is mounted by N10 of the N5-iminium
phosphate on N5, resulting in the formation of a tetrahedral
intermediate—phosphoimidazolidine. Phosphoimidazolidine is
eventually broken down to the product 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate by phosphate elimination. The last step of the reaction
imparts irreversibility to the overall reaction catalyzed by MTHFS.
To date, relatively little is known about the structural basis for the
mechanism of catalysis. The crystal structures of a ternary complex
of MTHFS from Mycoplasma pneumoniae (mpMTHFS) with ADP
and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (20) and a binary complex of MTHFS
from Bacillus anthracis (bMTHFS) with ADP (21) have been

reported. Although the ATP has been depicted as hydrolyzed and
modeled as ADP and inorganic phosphate in the mpMTHFS
structure, the substrate 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, rather than the
product 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate, has been modeled in the
active site. In addition, part of the 5-formyltetrahydrofolate moiety
has been assigned zero occupancy. The overall structure of
mpMTHFS and bMTHFS is similar, suggesting that MTHFS adopts
a highly conserved fold. Attempts have been made to gain
structural insights into inhibition of MTHFS based on steady-state
kinetics and molecular modeling of a murine MTHFS (mMTHFS;
refs. 22, 23). However, the interpretation of results is limited by the
accuracy of the model of mMTHFS, which was generated by using a
template that shares very low sequence identity.
Human MTHFS (hMTHFS) shares <28% sequence identity with
structures of MTHFS homologues deposited in Protein Data Bank
(PDB; ref. 24). In addition, several aspects of the structural basis for
the mechanism of catalysis are unknown. What are the determinants of ligand specificity? Which residues are essential for
catalysis? What is the structural basis for inhibition of hMTHFS
by folate analogues? To begin to address these issues and provide a
framework for the rational design of MTHFS inhibitors that could
aid cancer chemotherapy, we have determined the structures of
native hMTHFS, hMTHFS bound with ADP, hMTHFS in complex
with an N5-iminium phosphate intermediate, and an enzymeproduct complex of hMTHFS. Using the structures as a guide,
essential residues have been mapped by site-directed mutagenesis.
The structural and mutagenesis data unravel the determinants of
substrate specificity and provide new insights into the mechanism
of inhibition of hMTHFS.

Materials and Methods
Production of hMTHFS. MTHFS was amplified from human brain
cDNA library using the following primers: 5¶-TACTTCCAATCCAATGCTATGGCGGCGGCAGCGGT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TTATCCACTTCCAATGTTAAGCTGTTGACGAGTCT-3¶ (reverse). The PCR product was ligated into
pMCSG7 vector (25). Tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease-cleavable NH2terminal hexa His-tagged hMTHFS was produced in Escherichia coli BL21

DE3 cells. Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37jC until the
A 600nm reached 0.8. The culture was first cooled at 4jC for 45 min followed
by induction at 16jC with 0.2 mmol/L isopropyl-L-thio-B-D-galactopyranoside for 20 h. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by
sonication. Initial purification was carried out using Ni-affinity chromatography. His-tag was cleaved by treating the protein with TEV protease. Uncut
protein and the TEV protease were removed by a second round of Niaffinity chromatography. The protein was buffer exchanged into 20 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mmol/L NaCl, and 5 mmol/L h-mercaptoethanol
using a Superdex G75 size exclusion column. After concentration, the
protein (15–20 mg/mL) was immediately screened for crystallization.
MTHFS assay. The hMTHFS activity was measured by a Hitachi U-2010
spectrophotometer using [6S ]-5-formyltetrahydrofolate (Sigma) as a
substrate (23). hMTHFS was incubated with 0.5 mmol/L substrate in 400
AL of 50 mmol/L MES (pH 6.0), 20 mmol/L MgCl2, and 5 mmol/L ATP at
30jC for 2 min. The amount of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate formed at the
end of incubation period was quantitated by measuring the absorbance at
360 nm. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of 5,10methenyltetrahydrofolate formed per minute under the assay conditions.
All assays were performed in triplicates under identical conditions with
appropriate controls. The protein concentration was estimated by reading
the absorbance at 280 nm. An extinction coefficient of 16,055 mol/L 1 cm 1
was used to calculate the amount of protein in mg/mL.
Site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenesis was carried out using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer’s instructions. All the mutations were verified by sequencing the entire
length of the clone. Mutant and wild-type hMTHFS were expressed,
purified, and assayed under identical conditions.
Crystallization. Crystallization screening was done at 16jC using the
Mosquito (TTP Lab Tech) crystallization robot. Hanging drops (0.6 AL)
contained equal amounts of protein and mother liquor was equilibrated
against 50 AL of reservoir solution. After screening 400 conditions of
commercially available sparse matrix screens, crystals appeared within 2 d
in a solution containing 100 mmol/L HEPES (pH 6.6), 20 mmol/L
MgCl26H2O, 20 mmol/L NiCl26H2O, and 20% (w/v) PEG 3350. The crystals
belonged to space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions: a = 48.70 Å,
b = 145.12 Å, c = 59.21 Å; a = 90.00j, b = 90.00j, c = 90.00j.
Crystals for the binary complex of hMTHFS with ADP were obtained by
mixing the protein with 5 mmol/L ATP before setting up crystallization
drops. Crystals for the N5-iminium phosphate–bound hMTHFS and
enzyme-product complex of hMTHFS were obtained by mixing the protein

with 5 mmol/L 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and 5 mmol/L ATP before setting
up crystallization drops. Crystals harvested after 48 h revealed density for
N5-iminium phosphate, whereas crystals harvested after 72 h contained the
product 10-formyltetrahydrofolate in the active site. Crystals for all
the complexes were obtained under the same conditions as that of the
native hMTHFS.
Structure determination. Crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen before
diffraction testing and data collection. Native diffraction data were collected
at a wavelength of 0.979 Å at beamline 19-ID [Advanced Photon Source
(APS), Argonne National Laboratory]. Data were indexed and scaled to 1.9 Å
resolution using HKL2000 (26). The structure was solved by molecular
replacement with BALBES (27) using the structure of mpMTHFS (PDB code
1U3G) as a search model. The asymmetric unit consists of 1 molecule of
MTHFS with a solvent content of 49.8%. Data for the complexes of hMTHFS
were collected using an in-house FRE+ copper rotating anode and an
R-AXIS IV++ detector (Rigaku). A 1.8 Å resolution data set for the enzymeproduct complex was collected at APS. The structures of the complexes
were solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (28) using the native
structure as a search model. All the final models were refined using PHENIX
refine (29) and Refmac (30). Five percent of the unique reflections were
assigned in a random fashion to the ‘‘free’’ set for calculation of the free
R-factor (Rfree); the remaining 95% of the reflections constituted the
‘‘working’’ set for the calculation of the R-factor (R; ref. 31). Manual
adjustments to the model were done using COOT (32). Details of data
collection and refinement statistics are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
The quality of the final model was validated using MOLPROBITY (33).
The coordinates and structure factors of the native, ADP-bound, N5iminium phosphate–bound, and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate–bound hMTHFS
have been deposited in the PDB under the accession code 3HXT, 3HY6,
3HY4, and 3HY3, respectively.

Results
Overall structure of hMTHFS. The final model of the
apoenzyme consists of 197 residues (Table 1). Six amino acids,
L21-A23 and E187-D189, are disordered and could not be traced.
The secondary structural elements of hMTHFS are arranged in a
single domain with a three-layer, a/h/a, sandwich architecture and
a topology similar to the Rossmann fold (Fig. 2A and B). The

overall structure consists of a highly twisted sheet made up of eight
h strands flanked by a helices on either side. hMTHFS is made up
of five a helices. Whereas helices a2 and a3 are stacked against
four parallel h strands at the center, a5 is seen stacked on the
opposite side of the sheet. Interestingly, helix a1 is positioned
almost perpendicular to a2 and is close to the edge of the sheet.
Part of a1 is seen protruding out of the main body of the protein,
suggesting that it may be involved in protein-protein interactions.
The symmetry-generated intermolecular contacts introduced
during crystal packing involve residues from a1. Helix a4 is seen
inserted between strands h3 and h4, with a long loop connecting
a4 with h4. Such an insertion is not observed in the structure of
mpMTHFS. However, the overall structure of MTHFS from different
sources is similar.
To gain insights into the architecture of the ATP binding site,
hMTHFS was mixed with ATP before setting up crystallization
drops. Electron density for the purine ring and the sugar moiety
of the ATP was weak and only the phosphates could be modeled
accurately (Fig. 2A and C). In the crystal structures of
mpMTHFS and bMTHFS, the adenosine and sugar are lying on
the surface and have very little contact with the protein. On the
other hand, the phosphates are buried deep inside the protein
and are involved in extensive ionic interactions. The structure of
hMTHFS bound with phosphates (referred to as ADP-bound
hMTHFS) is almost identical to the structure of the apoenzyme.
The ATP used for cocrystallization experiments has been
hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate, as a result of
which a diphosphate and an inorganic phosphate have been
modeled in the structure. Residues E187-D189, which could not
be traced in the structure of the apoenzyme, are well ordered in
the structure of ADP-bound hMTHFS. These residues are close
to the ATP binding site, with D189 forming a hydrogen bond
with the O1 oxygen atom of the a-phosphate and a coordinate
bond with the magnesium atom. In addition, D189 is now
forming a salt bridge with K10. These new interactions observed
in the structure of hMTHFS in complex with ADP help stabilize

the loop (A174-D193) region, part of which is disordered in the
structure of the apoenzyme.
To gain a better understanding of the structural basis for
substrate binding and the underlying mechanism of catalysis, we
cocrystallized hMTHFS with ATP and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate.
Interestingly, analysis of the electron density for the 5-formyltetrahydrofolate substrate, coupled with the results of a search for
the anomalous signal of phosphate, revealed a phosphate group
covalently linked to the carbon atom belonging to the formyl group
of the 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. During the course of the cocrystallization (carried out at 16jC for 48 hours), the formyl group of the
substrate seems to have completed a nucleophilic attack at the gphosphate of the ATP, resulting in the formation of the N5-iminium
phosphate reaction intermediate, which was fortuitously trapped
inside the crystal used for data collection. The structure of
hMTHFS bound with the N5-iminium phosphate is similar to the
structures of the apoenzyme and ADP-bound complex of hMTHFS.
A notable difference is the movement of the side chain of Y83,
which has implications on the catalysis (Fig. 2D).
The structure of the enzyme-product complex of hMTHFS was
obtained by harvesting the crystals produced during the cocrystallization of hMTHFS with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and ATP after
72 hours. Except for the conformation of the side chains of Y83,
F85, and Y152, the overall structure of the enzyme-product
complex of hMTHFS is similar to the native, ADP-bound, and
N5-iminium phosphate–bound hMTHFS (Fig. 2D).
Folate binds in a spherical pocket. The pterin ring of the N5iminium phosphate moiety sits in the center of a large spherical
binding pocket formed by residues F55, L56, S57, M58, E61, P81,

Y83, M90, W109, P135, R148, K150, Y152, and Y153 (Fig. 3A). The
short helix (a4) and a long loop inserted between strands h3 and
h4 act like a cap and are seen partially covering the active site.
W109 is positioned above the pterin ring and seems to be closing
the lid on the active site. The distance between the two aromatic
rings is >7 Å, suggesting that W109 and the pterin ring do not
interact. The conformation of the pterin ring is not planar. It is
raised at the C6 position along the vertical axis (Fig. 3B). The
twisting of the pterin ring probably helps bring the reacting
functional groups in close proximity and adjust their orientation.
The carboxyl oxygens of E61 are interacting with the N3 and amine
nitrogens of the pterin ring. This interaction is of interest because
the glutamic acid at this position is conserved in all the orthologs
of MTHFS (Supplementary Fig. S1). M90 forms a hydrogen bond
with the N8 nitrogen of the pterin ring. Numerous hydrophobic van
der Waals contacts are observed between the pterin ring and
the aromatic side chains of F55, Y83, P135, Y152, and Y153.
Interestingly, the conformation of the aromatic ring of Y83 is
distinctly different in the structures of native hMTHFS and N5iminium phosphate–bound hMTHFS (Fig. 2D). The side chain
swivels and occupies an upright position, which allows the pterin
ring to dock in the binding pocket. This movement of the side
chain of Y83 in turn displaces the side chain of F85 away from the
binding pocket.
Further, the binding pocket is large enough to accommodate the
pABA moiety of the substrate, which is almost perpendicular to the
pterin ring. W109 and K150 form hydrogen bonds with the pABA
ring. The glutamate protrudes out of the binding pocket through a
circular hole at the top and is lying on the surface of the protein.

Adjacent to the hole is a large patch of positively charged potential,
which may be involved in the binding of polyglutamates (Fig. 2C).
ATP binding site. hMTHFS contains an ATP binding site, which
is distinct but in proximity to the substrate binding site (Figs. 2C
and 3A). Based on the position of the phosphates, ATP binds in a
positively charged cleft region between strand h6 and helix a5.
The a- and h-phosphates are tethered in the ATP binding cleft by
coordinate bonds with magnesium on one side and cohesive ionic
bonds on the opposite side. K10 forms an ionic bond with the O2
atom of the a-phosphate, whereas R14 forms an ionic bond with
the O1 atom of the h-phosphate. These residues are important for
the docking of the ATP. The g-phosphate forms two ionic bonds
with R145. This interaction is critical for the correct orientation of
the g-phosphate in order for it to be able to mount a nucleophilic

attack on the substrate and may also be essential for the
stabilization of the intermediate. The ATP binding cleft is
connected to the spherical tetrahydrofolate binding site internally
through a channel such that the g-phosphate of the ATP molecule
is positioned close to the N5 atom of the pterin ring (Fig. 3C).
Enzyme-product complex. The structure of the enzymeproduct complex was determined by delaying the harvest time of
crystals obtained during cocrystallization of hMTHFS with 5formyltetrahydrofolate and ATP. The overall structure of the
hMTHFS bound with product is almost identical to the other
structures of hMTHFS. Notably, the conformation of the side chains
of Y83 and Y152 is distinctly different (Fig. 2D). In the structure of
the N5-iminium phosphate–bound hMTHFS, we have seen that the
aromatic ring of Y83 moves by 120j to make way for the substrate

to dock (Fig. 2D). In the enzyme-product complex, the aromatic
ring of Y83 moves further 125j and is now seen forming a 2.4 Å
hydrogen bond with the side chain nitrogen of N88. As a
consequence of this movement, the aromatic ring of Y152 is
displaced by 100j (Fig. 2D). The side chain of F85 seen displaced in
the N5-iminium phosphate–bound hMTHFS structure returns back
to its original position (Fig. 2D).
An interesting aspect of the study of the enzyme-product
complex of hMTHFS was the analysis of the electron density for the
product. The density was not continuous between the N5 and N10
atoms, and therefore, the product 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate
could not be modeled. Instead, a formyl group could be modeled
accurately in the extra density seen at the N10 position, suggesting
the presence of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate rather than 5,10methenyltetrahydrofolate in the active site of hMTHFS (Fig. 3D).
5,10-Methenyltetrahydrofolate has been reported to degrade nonenzymatically to 10-formyltetrahydrofolate previously (1, 34).

www.aacrjournals.org

Increasing the expression of MTHFS in SHSY-5Y cells increased
the levels of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to as much as 90% of the
total cellular folate with a concomitant decrease in the levels of
5-formyltetrahydrofolate, suggesting that MTHFS may be able to
catalyze the conversion of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate to 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (35). This is the first structural evidence for the
synthesis of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate from 5-formyltetrahydrofolate by hMTHFS.
Structure-function analysis. Using the structures of hMTHFS
as a guide, we selected and probed the role of residues surrounding
the substrate and ATP binding site in catalysis by site-directed
mutagenesis (Table 1). Wild-type and mutant hMTHFS were
purified to homogeneity before testing the activity under identical
conditions. We interpret and discuss the results of mutagenesis in
light of the structures of hMTHFS, mpMTHFS, and bMTHFS.
Equivalent positions for the hMTHFS residues in mpMTHFS and
bMTHFS have been identified by superimposing the structures of

mpMTHFS and bMTHFS over the structure of hMTHFS. We
extrapolate our findings to other orthologs of MTHFS by aligning
the primary amino acid sequences obtained by running a PSIBLAST search (36) for homologues of hMTHFS (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Mutating K10, R14, or R145 to alanine decreased the
enzyme activity dramatically (Table 1). The structure of hMTHFS in
complex with ADP reveals that these residues are forming
hydrogen bonds with the phosphates, implying that they are
important for the binding of ATP. As expected, the D154A
mutation almost completely abolished enzymatic activity. The
OD1 and OD2 oxygens of D154 are hydrogen bonded to the
magnesium ion and are part of the octahedral coordination shell of
magnesium. This interaction is critical because the magnesium ion
is hydrogen bonded to a- and h-phosphates of the ATP, which
participates in the catalysis. K10, R14, R145, and D154 occupy
identical positions in the hMTHFS, mpMTHFS, and bMTHFS
structures. K10 and R14 are highly conserved, whereas R145 and
D154 are absolutely conserved among orthologs of MTHFS
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, MTHFS tethers the phosphates of
ATP using a highly conserved mechanism. The role of residues F55,
E61, Y83, M90, Y153, M58, and R148 surrounding the pterin ring of
tetrahydrofolate was investigated by mutating them to alanine
(Table 1). Interestingly, the E61A and Y153A mutations almost
completely abolished the enzymatic activity. In the structure of
hMTHFS bound with N5-iminium phosphate, the carboxyl oxygens
of E61 are interacting with the C2 amino group and the N3
nitrogen. These interactions are probably critical for anchoring the
substrate in the binding pocket. Y153 is positioned below the pterin
ring and defines the bottom edge of the binding pocket. Both E61
and Y153 are seen occupying identical positions in hMTHFS,
mpMTHFS, and bMTHFS structures and are absolutely conserved
in MTHFS orthologs (Supplementary Fig. S1). Although the M90A
and R148A mutations did not abolish the enzymatic activity
completely, >50% of the activity was compromised, indicating that
the longer side chains at this position could increase the efficiency
of catalysis of hMTHFS. M90 is replaced by an isoleucine in
mpMTHFS. Interestingly, R148 has been changed to a phenylalanine and a tyrosine in mpMTHFS and bMTHFS, respectively. The
arginine at this location is not highly conserved among the
orthologs of MTHFS. Notably, the orthologs have only two choices
at this position: an aromatic amino acid or an arginine
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Because R148 is close to the pABA ring,
replacing it with an aromatic amino acid could initiate stacking
interactions with the pABA ring and promote the nucleophilic
attack of N10 on the N5-iminium phosphate. The F55A mutation
resulted in >45% loss in enzyme activity (Table 1), suggesting that a
hydrophobic residue may be essential at this position for efficient
catalysis. F55 is replaced by a tyrosine in mpMTHFS and a
threonine in bMTHFS. Sequence alignment results reveal that this
position is occupied by a hydrophobic residue in the orthologs of
MTHFS. Y83 and M58 do not seem to be essential for catalysis
because the enzyme activity did not decrease after mutating
either of them to alanine. A valine is present at the position of
Y83 in mpMTHFS, whereas a cysteine occupies an equivalent
position in the structure of bMTHFS. M58 is replaced by an
isoleucine in mpMTHFS. In the structure of native hMTHFS,
F85 and W109 form a cap over the active site. The decrease in
activity for the F85A mutation was only marginal. W109A
mutation resulted in over 60% loss in activity (Table 1). These
residues probably assist in isolating the reactants from the
solvent during catalysis. A serine replaces the phenylalanine in

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (18). September 15, 2009

mpMTHFS, whereas a lysine is seen at a similar position in
bMTHFS. W109 is part of a long insertion (E96-G117), which is
not seen in mpMTHFS. A tyrosine is present at a similar
location in the bMTHFS. Further, the Y152A mutation lowered
the enzyme activity by over 75% (Table 1). Y152 is close to the
pterin ring and may be important for the correct orientation of
the ring or the integrity of the binding pocket. The position of
the side chain of Y152 is different in the native and enzymeproduct complex structures of hMTHFS, suggesting a role for
Y152 in product release. Y152 is conserved in the mpMTHFS
and bMTHFS. A majority of the orthologs of MTHFS have a
tyrosine at this position, with an occasional occurrence of
phenylalanine (Supplementary Fig. S1). The K150A mutation did
not have any effect on enzyme activity, suggesting that K150 is
not essential for catalysis. K150 is replaced by a glycine in the
bMTHFS.

Discussion
Determinants of ligand specificity. An interesting aspect of
the native hMTHFS is the location of the side chain of Y83 inside
the binding pocket. The aromatic ring of Y83 sterically obstructs
the placement of the pterin ring inside the pocket (Fig. 2D). In the
structure of the N5-iminium phosphate–bound hMTHFS, the side
chain of Y83 has moved by 120j, allowing the placement of the
pterin ring inside the pocket. Obviously, the Y83 somehow
recognizes the substrate and moves. Such a mechanism of
substrate binding offers greater selectivity by occluding functional
groups that are not compatible or those that cannot be
‘‘recognized’’ by the side chain of Y83. Mutating Y83 to alanine
had no effect on enzyme activity, suggesting that the role of Y83 is
dispensable.
Structural basis for inhibition of hMTHFS by N10substituted folate analogues. hMTHFS has been reported to be
feedback inhibited by 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (22). Analysis of
the structure of the enzyme-product complex of hMTHFS reveals
that the synthesis or binding of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate places
the formyl group of N10 within van der Waals radii of Y83.
Therefore, to avoid steric clashes, Y83 moves by 125j from its
position seen in the N5-iminium phosphate reaction intermediatebound hMTHFS (Fig. 4A and B). The movement of Y83 displaces
Y152, which moves away from Y83 to avoid steric clashes. This
places Y152 in front of the channel connecting the ATP binding
site with the substrate binding pocket. Y152 blocks the channel,
obstructing any further nucleophilic attacks by the g-phosphate of
ATP (Fig. 4A and B). More importantly, the Y152 could preclude
the positioning of the g-phosphate of ATP within hydrogen
bonding distance of N5 owing to steric hindrance. Therefore,
tetrahydrofolates with N10 substitutions can act as potential
inhibitors of MTHFS activity (23). Our study provides for the first
time the structural basis for this inhibition. The structure of the
N5-iminium phosphate–bound hMTHFS not only contributes
toward the unraveling of the basis for this inhibition but also
helps explain why Y83 may be unobtrusive during catalysis
of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate. This
further underscores the importance of having reaction intermediates while studying reaction mechanisms.
In conclusion, the structures of hMTHFS determined by
us provide a clear picture of the folate and ATP binding pockets.
The snapshot of the N5-iminium phosphate–bound hMTHFS
accounts for the first intermediate formed during the conversion

Structure of Human MTHFS

of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate. The
structure of the enzyme-product complex of hMTHFS reveals
new features of hMTHFS-mediated catalysis. This study provides
for the first time structural evidence for the synthesis of
10-formyltetrahydrofolate from 5-formyltetrahydrofolate by
hMTHFS. From our structural studies, we can begin to rationalize
the basis for inhibition of hMTHFS by 10-formyltetrahydrofolate
and N10-substituted antifolates. We have identified amino acids
critical for catalysis by site-directed mutagenesis. The structural,
mutagenesis, and primary sequence analysis data of MTHFS
orthologs suggest a highly conserved mechanism of catalysis. The
structures of the essential hMTHFS reported here open up
new opportunities for rationally designing antifolates or small
molecules to combat the proliferation of cells.
