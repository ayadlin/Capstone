autophagy. Most of the time, necrosis-like PCD involves specialized
caspase-independent signaling pathways, but in some cases,
caspase-dependent signaling pathways have also been observed
(1). Necrosis can be regarded as a controlled mechanism, which is
involved in physiologic processes, such as embryogenesis, normal
tissue renewal, and immune response (2). Necrosis has also been
implicated in cancer therapy (3), although more investigations are
still needed to establish the role of such a cell death (4).
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a–related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL) is a potential anticancer agent that induces
apoptosis in cancer cells but not in most normal cells (5).
Depending on the cell type, death receptor triggering can induce
apoptosis or necrosis (6, 7) and, depending on the stimulation of
both apoptosis and necrosis, can occur in the same cell (8). Many
reports have shown that death receptor ligation induces
programmed necrosis under specific experimental conditions, such
as intracellular ATP depletion (1, 9) and caspase inhibition (10, 11),
or in caspase-8 deficient cells (12). More recently, a murine
recombinant TRAIL molecule has been reported to naturally
induce a caspase-independent necrosis in TRAMP-C2 murine
prostate adenocarcinoma cells (13).
The necrotic program induced by death receptors is dependent
on the receptor-interacting protein RIP1 (10). RIP1 protein
contains three domains, including an NH2-terminal serine/
threonine kinase domain, an intermediate domain, and a COOHterminal death domain (14). RIP1 has been involved both in
nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) activation (15, 16) and in cell death
induction (10, 17, 18). Whereas the death domain and the
intermediate domain of RIP1 are involved in NF-nB activation,
the kinase domain of RIP1 is dispensable (see ref. 19 for review).
However, this kinase domain is necessary for FasL-, TRAIL-, and
TNF-induced caspase-independent necrosis (10).
We have recently reported that, under acidic extracellular
conditions, TRAIL induces a caspase-dependent necrosis-like cell
death (20). An acidic extracellular environment is often a
characteristic of solid tumors (21), and evidence indicates that it
might modulate the tumor response to chemotherapy in vivo (22).
Furthermore, the role of pH in cell death is now well recognized
(23). A recent work has shown that sensitization of human prostate
or colon cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis under acidic
extracellular conditions was dependent on mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (24). We show here that, under acidic extracellular pH
(pHe 6.5) conditions, HT29 human colon cancer cells are sensitized
to TRAIL through a necrosis-like cell death, which is dependent
on caspase activation. In contrast, under physiologic pHe (7.4)
conditions, TRAIL induces a typical apoptotic cell death. Moreover,
degradation of RIP1 by geldanamycin pretreatment, small RNA
interference inhibition of RIP expression, and transfection of

Abstract
Tumor necrosis factor-A–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) is a potential anticancer agent that induces apoptosis
in cancer cells but not in most normal cells. How tumor
physiology, particularly acidic extracellular pH (pHe), would
modify sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL-induced cell death
is not known. We have previously shown that cancer cells,
resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis at physiologic pHe (7.4),
could be sensitized to TRAIL at acidic pHe (6.5). However, at
this acidic pHe, cell death was necrotic. We show here that, in
spite of a necrosis-like cell death morphology, caspases are
activated and are necessary for TRAIL-induced cell death at
acidic pHe in HT29 human colon cancer cells. Furthermore, we
observed that, whereas receptor-interacting protein (RIP) was
cleaved following TRAIL treatment at physiologic pHe (7.4), it
was not cleaved following TRAIL treatment at acidic pHe (6.5).
Moreover, RIP degradation by geldanamycin or decrease
expression of RIP by small RNA interference transfection
inhibited TRAIL-induced necrosis at acidic pHe, showing that
RIP was necessary for this necrotic cell death pathway. We
also show that RIP kinase activity was essential for this cell
death pathway. Altogether, we show that, under acidic pHe
conditions, TRAIL induces a necrosis-like cell death pathway
that depends both on caspases and RIP kinase activity. Thus,
our data suggest for the first time that RIP-dependent necrosis
might be a major death pathway in TRAIL-based therapy in
solid tumors with acidic pHe. [Cancer Res 2007;67(1):218–26]

Introduction
Cell death mainly occurs through two forms of cell death:
apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptosis, also called ‘‘programmed cell
death’’ (PCD), is characterized by the activation of caspases
(cysteine proteases). Dying by apoptosis is an active process
requiring energy in the form of ATP. At the opposite, necrosis is a
passive process resulting from a bioenergetic catastrophe characterized by an important ATP depletion incompatible with cell
survival. Accidental necrosis is characterized by cellular swelling,
cytoplasm vacuolation, and plasma membrane breakdown. However, since several years, alternative, nonapoptotic forms of PCD
have been described and classified as programmed necrosis or

alone or in combination with 3 Ag RIP-expressing pMSCV plasmids. RIP
wild-type (WT), RIP K45R, and RIP D138N plasmids were generated by PCR
amplification and checked by sequencing. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with TRAIL at acidic pHe and analyzed by flow
cytometry 24 h later to determine the percentage of propidium iodide–
stained cell among the GFP-positive cells.
Cell morphology. Cells were fixed by dropwise addition of glutaraldehyde and analyzed according to standard conditions. After fixation, the
specimens were rinsed several times with PBS followed by postfixation with
1% osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer for 1 h. After a further rinsing
again with PBS for 15 min, the tissue specimens were dehydrated through a
series of graded ethyl alcohols from 70% to 100%. Cells were then embedded
in DMP30 Eponate for 24 h at 60jC.
Measurement of caspase activities. Cell lysates (50 Ag) obtained in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 1 mmol/L paramethylsulfonide, 1 mmol/L benzamidine] were
incubated for 30 min at 37jC in a caspase assay buffer [100 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.0), 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mmol/L DTT]
containing 20 Amol/L of either IETD-AFC or DEVD-AMC (Calbiochem).
Caspase activities were measured by monitoring fluorescence continuously
in a dual luminescence fluorimeter (SpectraMax Gemini XS, Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using specific excitation and emission wavelength
for each peptide. Enzyme activities were determined as initial velocities and
expressed as relative intensity/minute/milligram protein compared with
control.
NF-KB activity measurement. NF-nB activation was measured with the
TransAM NF-nB p65 kit (Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium). The kit is an
ELISA assay based on measurement of p65 binding activity to specific
consensus DNA sequence. Briefly, nuclear extracts were purified as follows:
cells were washed with PBS supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors and
then resuspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mmol/L HEPES, 5 mmol/L NaF,
10 Amol/L Na2MoO4, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA). Cells were then kept on ice for
15 min before addition of 10% NP40 (0.5% final). After a 30-s centrifugation,
the nuclear pellet was resuspended in complete lysis buffer and rocked for
30 min on ice. After a 10-min centrifugation at 14,000  g, protein
concentration was determined on the supernatant by Bradford assay.
Nuclear extract (10 Ag) was added per ELISA well, incubated with anti-p65
primary antibody for 2 h, washed, and incubated with the secondary
peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 h. After three washes, the developing
solution was added for 10 min. Absorbance at 450 nm was finally read with
a spectrophotometer (iEMS, Labsystem, BMG Labtech Sarl, Champigny sur
Marne, France).
Western blot analysis. After treatment, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer
[150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% (v/v) SDS, 0.5% (v/v)
sodium deoxycholate, 100 Amol/L paramethylsulfonide, 1 Ag/mL pepstatin,
2 Ag/mL leupeptin] at 4jC and then boiled for 3 min. Proteins (50 Ag) were
separated on a polyacrylamide sodium dodecylsulfate–containing gel and
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, Orsay, France). After
blocking nonspecific binding sites for 1 h at room temperature by 5% (w/v)
skimmed milk in PBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TPBS), membranes were
incubated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4jC with the
different antibodies. Membranes were then washed twice with TPBS and
incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or antirabbit antibodies. Revelation was done by chemiluminescence.
ATP concentration measurement. ATP concentration was measured
with the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega,
Charbonnières, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, after treatment, cells were lysed in the provided buffer and the
luminescent substrate was added. Luminescence was measured with a
fluorimeter/luminometer (SpectraMax Gemini XS). In parallel, cell viability
was determined by a methylene blue colorimetric assay (25) in additional
wells where cells have not been lysed but have been fixed in ethanol. ATP
concentration was next expressed as percentage of ATP measured in
untreated cells per cell number.
Measurement of intracellular superoxide anion by flow cytometry.
DHE was used to detect intracellular superoxide anion production. After

kinase-dead RIP-expressing vectors inhibited TRAIL-induced necrosis under acidic extracellular conditions. Altogether, these data
therefore show that, under acidic extracellular conditions, TRAIL
induces a necrosis-like cell death that depends on both caspases
and RIP1 kinase activity. This new TRAIL-induced necrosis-like
PCD pathway may account for TRAIL-induced cell death in solid
tumors with acidic pHe.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and antibodies. The recombinant human soluble Flagtagged TRAIL was from Alexis Biochemicals (Coger, Paris, France).3
Propidium iodide, anti-Flag M2, and membrane-permeable calpain inhibitor
E64d were from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). The
dihydroethidium (DHE) and Hoechst 33342 were from Molecular Probes
(Invitrogen, Abingdon, United Kingdom). TransFectin lipid and Bradford
reagents were from Bio-Rad (Marnes-la-Coquette, France). Mouse anti-RIP
was from PharMingen (BD Biosciences, Le Pont de Claix, France). The
rabbit polyclonal anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was from
Roche (Roche Diagnostics France S.A., Meylan, France). The rabbit antiphosphorylated InB-a and the rabbit anti-InB-a were from Cell Signaling
(Ozyme, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France). The mouse monoclonal antiheat shock protein constitutive 70 (HSC70) and the rabbit polyclonal antiglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody were from
Santa Cruz (Tebu, Le Perray en Yvelines, France). The rat anti-heat shock
protein 90 (HSP90) was from Stressgen (Tebu). The anti-Flag M2 was used
to cross-link the ligand TRAIL, leading to the formation of oligomers that
are more effective to induce cell death. Briefly, 50 ng/mL of the soluble Flagtagged TRAIL were incubated with 2 Ag/mL anti-Flag M2 for 5 min at room
temperature before cell treatment. The caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-fmk),
the caspase inhibitor negative control (z-FA-fmk, an inhibitor of cathepsin
D), geldanamycin, CA-074-Me (cathepsin B inhibitor IV), calpain inhibitor
III, and InB-a phosphorylation inhibitor Bay 117085 were from Calbiochem
(France Biochem, Meudon, France).
Cell culture conditions and cytotoxic assay. The HT29 human colon
carcinoma cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Rockville, MD) and cultured in Eagle’s MEM (Eurobio, Les Ulis,
France) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS (Life Technologies, Cergy
Pontoise, France) and glutamine (2 mmol/L) under a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
To modify the value of pHe, a culture medium without sodium hydrogenocarbonate (Eurobio) was used. To set the pHe of this medium to either
7.4 or 6.5, we next supplemented it with 23 or 3 mmol/L sodium hydrogenocarbonate, respectively, in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Microscopic detection of apoptosis or necrosis was carried out in both
floating and adherent cells recovered after TRAIL treatment using nuclear
chromatin staining with 1 Ag/mL Hoechst 33342 and 1 Ag/mL propidium
iodide for 15 min at 37jC. Apoptotic cells (i.e., with condensed blue
chromatin or fragmented blue nuclei) or necrotic cells (i.e., with red nuclei)
were counted in comparison with total population (n = 300 cells).
Cell transfection. HT29 cells (400,000) seeded in six-well plate were
transfected with either nonspecific (nontargeting siRNA1, Dharmacon,
Ozyme, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France) or RIP siRNA (siGENOME siRNA
gene ID 8737, Dharmacon) by using TransFectin according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 100 nmol/L siRNA was applied in a
final volume of 1 mL Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). For Western blot
analysis, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. For cell death
experiment, following 16-h transfection period, cells were treated with
TRAIL at acidic pHe for 24 h.
Plasmid transfections were done using Amaxa nucleofector (Amaxa
GmbH, Cologne, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, trypsinized cells were resuspended in provided supplemented buffer
and transfected with 3 Ag of green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmids

treatment, floating and adherent cells (0.5  106) were recovered and
incubated in medium without FCS containing 5 Amol/L DHE for 15 min
at 37jC. Dye oxidation (increase in FL-2 fluorescence) was measured using
a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Le Pont-De-Claix, France)
with excitation and emission settings at 488 and 530 nm, respectively.
A positive control was obtained by incubating cells with menadione
(1 mmol/L). Superimposition of control and menadione histograms
allowed to define a gate for calculating the percentage of cells producing
superoxide anion.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were carried out using the
unilateral Student’s t test considering the variances as unequal. The
significance is shown as follows: *, P V 0.05; **, P V 0.02; and ***, P V 0.01.

apoptosis (Fig. 1B). In contrast, at pHe 6.5, HT29 cells became very
sensitive to TRAIL and a 24-h TRAIL treatment induced f80% of
necrosis-like cell death characterized by red cells with the loss of
plasma membrane integrity and the absence of chromatin
fragmentation (Fig. 1A and B). We next did kinetics of TRAIL
treatment. We observed that TRAIL-induced necrosis-like cell
death occurred very rapidly and independently of apoptosis
induction because 20% of red cells were detected without any
detection of apoptotic cells after a 4-h TRAIL treatment at acidic
pHe (Fig. 1B). Moreover, TRAIL induced 80% of necrosis-like cell
death without any apoptosis induction after a 24-h TRAIL
treatment at pHe 6.5 (Fig. 1B). TRAIL-induced cell death at acidic
pHe was also characterized by a high reactive oxygen species
generation, with f60% of positive cells stained with the DHE
probe (Fig. 1C), and by ATP depletion (Fig. 1D), both of which
representing characteristics of necrosis. In the first 8 h, intracellular
ATP level quickly decreased in HT29 cells treated with TRAIL at
acidic pHe in comparison with low ATP depletion observed in
HT29 cells treated with TRAIL at physiologic pHe (Fig. 1D). To
study if TRAIL-induced necrosis-like cell death at pHe 6.5 was a
reversible process, we did experiments where HT29 cells were
treated with TRAIL at pHe 6.5 during increased periods (2, 4, 6,
and 8 h) before restoration of physiologic pHe until 20 h. Under
these experimental conditions, only restoration of pHe to

TRAIL Induces RIP-Dependent Necrosis under Acidic pHe

Figure 2. TRAIL-induced cell death at acidic pHe is a reversible process and is dependent on caspase activation. A, HT29 cells were treated with TRAIL at
acidic pHe for the indicated times before restoration of physiologic pHe by addition of sodium hydrogenocarbonate to reach a final concentration of 23 mmol/L.
Percentages of apoptosis and necrosis-like cell death were estimated 20 h after TRAIL treatment at acidic pHe. Points, mean (n = 3); bars, SD. B, electron microscopy

20 Amol/L), cathepsin B inhibitor (CA-74-Me ; 25 Amol/L), or E64d (10 Amol/L). Percentage of necrosis was determined as in Fig. 1. Columns, mean (n = 3);
bars, SD. D, caspase activation was measured in lysates from cell treated with TRAIL for the indicated times at physiologic pHe (7.4) or at acidic pHe (6.5) by using
IETD-AFC (Caspase-8 ) or DEVD-AMC (Caspase-3 ) peptide substrates and expressed as arbitrary units (AU ). One representative of three independent experiments.

24 h (Fig. 2D). In contrast, at pHe 7.4, caspase-8 and caspase-3
activation was lower than at pHe 6.5 (Fig. 2D). These results
suggested that TRAIL induced a caspase-dependent necrosis-like
cell death at pHe 6.5.
TRAIL treatment induces RIP1 expression, which is not
cleaved under acidic pHe conditions. We next did kinetics of
TRAIL treatment in HT29 cells under both physiologic and acidic
pHe conditions. Western blot analysis showed that the expression
of RIP1 protein was increased in HT29 cells treated with TRAIL
but more quickly at acidic pHe ( from 4 to 24 h) than at physiologic
pHe ( from 8 to 24 h; Fig. 3A). Interestingly, RIP1 was cleaved on
TRAIL treatment at pHe 7.4 but not at pHe 6.5 (Fig. 3A). The
cleavage of RIP1 following TRAIL treatment at pHe 7.4 was caspase8 dependent because pretreatment with z-IETD-fmk, a caspase8 inhibitor, prevented this cleavage (Fig. 3B).
TRAIL induced a necrosis-like cell death at pHe 6.5 that
depends on RIP1 kinase activity. Pretreatment with geldanamycin, a HSP90 function inhibitor, reverted TRAIL-induced necrosislike cell death to apoptosis at acidic pHe (Fig. 4A). As it has been
shown that disruption of HSP90 function by addition of
geldanamycin results in degradation of RIP1, we studied by
Western blot analysis the expression of RIP1 following TRAIL
treatment under both physiologic and acidic pHe conditions in
HT29 cells. Concomitant with the inhibition of TRAIL-induced
necrosis-like cell death by geldanamycin, RIP1 expression was

physiologic value (7.4) during the first 4 h after TRAIL treatment at
pHe 6.5 restored TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2A). Finally, to fully
characterize the mode of TRAIL-induced cell death at acidic pHe,
we did an electron microscopic analysis. We observed that, after a
24-h TRAIL treatment at acidic pHe, cells were swollen with
increased cytoplasmic vacuolation, breakdown of plasma membrane and nuclear envelop, no or weak chromatin condensation,
and no nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 2B). On the contrary, at physiologic pHe, we clearly observed nuclear condensation and maintenance of plasma membrane integrity after a 24-h TRAIL treatment
(Fig. 2B). All these data suggested that TRAIL induced a
programmed necrosis-like cell death at acidic pHe.
Caspases are activated and necessary for TRAIL-induced
necrosis-like cell death at acidic pHe (6.5). We have previously
described that TRAIL-induced necrosis-like cell death at acidic pHe
was dependent on caspases (Fig. 2C; ref. 20). Because other
proteases, such as calpain or cathepsins, could be involved in
necrosis, we tested inhibitors of these proteases. None of these
inhibitors of calpain or cathepsins was able to inhibit TRAILinduced necrosis-like cell death at acidic pHe or to induce cell
death at physiologic pHe (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, we observed that
both initiator caspase-8 and effector caspase-3 were activated
because IETD-AFC and DEVD-AMC, peptide substrates that
mimic caspase-8 and caspase-3 target sites, respectively, were very
rapidly cleaved on TRAIL treatment at acidic pHe from 4 h until

been involved in NF-nB activation (15, 16, 26), we used an ELISA
assay based on p65 binding activity to specific consensus DNA
sequence to detect NF-nB activation following TRAIL treatment
at both physiologic and acidic pHe. This assay showed that
NF-nB was activated in HT29 cells treated with TRAIL but much
more efficiently at acidic pHe than at physiologic pHe (Fig. 6A).
Consistent with these data, we observed a transient InB-a
phosphorylation at both physiologic and acidic pHe from 2 to
4 h on TRAIL treatment (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, InB-a was
degraded in HT29 cells treated with TRAIL at acidic pHe
(Fig. 6B). TRAIL-induced NF-nB activation at pHe 6.5 was
inhibited by geldanamycin pretreatment, suggesting the implication of RIP1 in this activation (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, pretreatment with z-IETD-fmk, a caspase-8 inhibitor, had no effect on
TRAIL-induced NF-nB activation at pHe 6.5 (Fig. 6C), whereas
it inhibits TRAIL-induced necrosis-like cell death at pHe 6.5
(Fig. 2C), suggesting that NF-nB activation was dispensable for
TRAIL-induced necrosis at pHe 6.5. This was confirmed by using
Bay 117085, a specific NF-nB inhibitor. Indeed, pretreatment
with this inhibitor had no effect on TRAIL-induced necrosis-like
cell death at acidic pHe (Fig. 6D). Altogether, these data suggest
that NF-nB signaling is not essential to TRAIL-induced necrosis
at pHe.

Discussion
We have previously described that, under acidic pHe (6.5)
conditions, TRAIL induced a necrosis-like cell death in human
HT29 colon cancer and HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cell lines. This
cell death seemed to be dependent on TRAIL-R1/TRAIL-R2 death
receptors and caspases and was partially inhibited by Bcl-2
expression (20). We investigated here the molecular mechanisms
involved in this caspase-dependent necrosis-like cell death. We
observed by electron microscopy analysis that, at acidic
pHe, TRAIL-treated HT29 cells presented an enlarged cytoplasm,
breakdown of plasma membrane, and nuclear envelop with
chromatin condensation in some extent but no nuclear fragmentation in contrast to what was observed at physiologic pHe.
These morphologic characteristics of necrotic cells (27) further
confirmed that, at acidic pHe, TRAIL induced a necrosis-like PCD
in HT29 cells. Whereas TRAIL induced a caspase-independent
necrosis in TRAMP-C2 murine prostate adenocarcinoma cells
(13), TRAIL induced a caspase-dependent necrosis-like cell death
at pHe 6.5 in HT29 human colon cancer cells because
pretreatment with caspase inhibitors z-VAD-fmk or z-IETD-fmk
completely inhibited this form of cell death (20). This observation suggested that TRAIL-induced necrosis-like cell death
at pHe 6.5 required caspase activation as well as the TRAIL
apoptotic death pathway. Activation of caspases was confirmed
by measuring the released fluorescence after the cleavage of
fluorescent peptide substrates mimicking caspase-8 and caspase3 target sites. Caspase-8 and caspase-3 activations were observed
to be greater in HT29 cells after TRAIL treatment at acidic pHe
(6.5) than at physiologic pHe (7.4). The very high level of caspase
activation in TRAIL-treated HT29 cells at acidic pHe (6.5) might
be accounted for cytosolic acidification (20). Indeed, several
caspases are targets for cytosolic acidification and their
activation is facilitated by acidic pHe (23). All these data are in
accordance with some reports describing caspase-dependent
FasL-induced necrosis (28) or other caspase-dependent necrosislike cell death pathways (29, 30).

highly decreased in TRAIL-treated HT29 cells after geldanamycin
pretreatment (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the observation that
geldanamycin pretreatment led to a switch from TRAIL-induced
necrosis-like cell death to apoptotic cell death at acidic pHe
(Fig. 4A), PARP cleavage was restored under these conditions
(Fig. 4B). The quantitative analysis of PARP cleavage (band at
85 kDa) showed that the cleavage of PARP was detected in HT29
cells treated with TRAIL at pHe 7.4 after or not a geldanamycin
pretreatment and only in HT29 cells treated with TRAIL at pHe 6.5
after a geldanamycin pretreatment when apoptosis was restored
(Fig. 4A and B). We next did RNA interference experiments with
RIP1 small interfering RNAs (siRNA). We observed that transfection
with RIP1 siRNAs completely reduced RIP protein expression in
HT29 cells (Fig. 5A) and induced a significant (f30 %) inhibition of
TRAIL-induced necrosis-like cell death at pHe 6.5 (Fig. 5B). This
transfection did not modify the low level of necrosis induced by
TRAIL at pHe 7.4 (Fig. 5B). On the contrary, transfection with
nonspecific siRNAs had effect neither on cell death induction nor
on RIP protein expression (Fig. 5A and B). We further did transient
transfection with both kinase-dead RIP-expressing vectors (RIP
K45R and RIP D138N) and RIP WT to evaluate TRAIL-induced
necrosis under acidic conditions. These experiments showed that
the functional RIP kinase domain was necessary for TRAIL-induced
necrosis because expression of the kinase-dead RIP constructs
induced f60% inhibition compared with the WT construct
(Fig. 5C).
TRAIL-induced NF-KB activation at acidic pHe (6.5) is not
essential for necrosis-like cell death induction. As RIP1 has

TRAIL Induces RIP-Dependent Necrosis under Acidic pHe

induced degradation reversed TRAIL-induced necrosis-like cell
death to apoptosis at acidic pHe. Accordingly, the use of RIP1
siRNAs by transient transfection inhibited TRAIL-induced necrosislike cell death at pHe 6.5. Moreover, transient transfections of RIP
kinase-dead mutants using plasmids encoding either a mutant in
which the conserved lysine in the kinase subdomain II was
mutated (RIP K45R) or which has been mutated within the
phosphotransferase loop of subdomain VI (RIP D138N) strongly
inhibited TRAIL-induced necrosis-like cell death. Both mutants
were shown to lack the kinase activity (33) and to also inhibit Fasinduced necrosis (10). Because HT29 cells exhibit very low
endogenous RIP protein level, our results suggest that RIP
kinase-dead mutant expression has behaved as a dominantnegative protein. It has recently been shown that RIP is necessary
for disruption of the interaction between cyclophilin D and anion
nucleotide translocator leading to a decrease in ATP and
subsequently to necrosis (34). However, the implication of RIP
kinase activity in this pathway has not yet been determined. We
have also observed a decrease in ATP concentration following
TRAIL treatment under acidic extracellular conditions, and
because TRAIL-induced necrosis can partially be inhibited by
Bcl-2 expression (20), our findings emphasize the possibility that
RIP might target the mitochondria. However, the target of RIP
kinase activity has not thus far been identified.

We also did kinetics to study RIP1 expression in HT29 cells after
TRAIL treatment under both physiologic and acidic pHe conditions. We showed that RIP1 expression levels were very low in
HT29 cells but highly increased on TRAIL treatment at both acidic
or physiologic pHe. However, the kinetics of RIP1 induction in
HT29 cells were faster after TRAIL treatment at acidic ( from 4 to
24 h) compared with physiologic pHe ( from 8 to 24 h). Induction of
RIP has already been described in lipopolysaccharide-treated
lymphocytes (19) or oltipraz-treated HT29 and HCT-116 cells
(31). However, the molecular mechanisms of such an induction
remain unknown. It has also been previously described that RIP1
could be cleaved by caspase-8 and that the COOH-terminal
cleavage product of RIP1 was an inducer of apoptosis and an
inhibitor of NF-nB signaling (32). Here, we observed that a caspase8-dependent cleavage product of RIP1 was generated during
stimulation by TRAIL at pHe 7.4, which correlated with the
induction of apoptosis and with a low level of NF-nB activation in
HT29 cells. In contrast, RIP1 was not cleaved after TRAIL treatment
at pHe 6.5, a finding that correlated with the induction of necrosis
and the strong activation of NF-nB in HT29 cells. These data
therefore suggested that TRAIL-induced necrosis-like cell death at
pHe 6.5 might depend on RIP1 expression. To test this hypothesis,
we used geldanamycin, known to induce degradation of RIP1
protein (17). Using geldanamycin, we could show that RIP1-

TRAIL-induced necrosis and restored TRAIL-induced
apoptosis with PARP cleavage at acidic pHe. A, HT29 cells
were treated with TRAIL (50 ng/mL cross-linked with
2 Ag/mL anti-Flag M2) or not for 24 h at physiologic pHe
(7.4) or at acidic pHe (6.5) after a 1-h pretreatment or not
with geldanamycin (GA; 0.5 or 1 Amol/L). Percentage

as in Fig. 1. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SD. B, HT29
cells were treated or not for 24 h with TRAIL after a
1-h pretreatment or not with geldanamycin (1 Amol/L), and
Western blot analysis of PARP and RIP expression was
done as described in Materials and Methods. The relative
cleaved PARP expression was expressed in arbitrary
units as percentage of absorbance measured in untreated
cells. Anti-human HSP90 was used as a control of
protein loading. One representative of three independent

residues, which remains to be identified (36). Moreover, selective
processing of substrates by caspase-8 at pHe 6.5 could also account
for the absence of RIP1 cleavage similarly to what was previously
described following T-cell receptor stimulation (37). It is interesting
to notice that, whereas RIP was not cleaved at pHe 6.5 on TRAIL
treatment, Bid was cleaved in its truncated form (data not shown).
This cleavage of Bid could account, at least in part, for the
implication of caspase activation in this necrotic pathway.
In some cellular systems, necrosis-like cell death has already
been reported to occur downstream of mitochondria (38). Our data
suggest that TRAIL-induced necrosis-like cell death at pHe 6.5
could occur upstream of mitochondria at the level of caspase8 because z-IETD-fmk, a caspase-8 inhibitor, completely blocked
TRAIL-induced necrosis-like cell death at pHe 6.5, whereas Bcl-2
expression in HT29 cells partially inhibited this cell death (20).
TRAIL is usually described as an apoptosis inducer. A recent
study has shown that TRAIL could induce a caspase-independent
necrosis-like cell death in TRAMP-C2 murine prostate adenocarcinoma cells (13). We showed for the first time that TRAIL induced
RIP1- and caspase-dependent necrosis-like cell death in HT29
cells at acidic pHe. It has also been shown that death receptor
could induce necrosis-like cell death under certain circumstances
(1, 10–12). Nevertheless, necrosis-like PCD signaling is still poorly
understood. We observed here that RIP1 is necessary for necrosislike cell death induced by TRAIL under acidic extracellular
conditions. Thus, the apoptosis/necrosis switch under acidic
pHe condition is an early decision in the signaling of cell death
because it was possible to revert the necrotic signaling pathway by
restoring a physiologic pHe only until 4 h after TRAIL treatment at
acidic pHe.
As RIP1 is also essential for NF-nB activation, we have studied
NF-nB activation after TRAIL treatment at acidic and physiologic
pHe as well as its involvement in TRAIL-induced necrosis-like
cell death at pHe 6.5. We showed here that the level of NF-nB
activation was very high in HT29 cells treated with TRAIL at
pHe 6.5 and was dependent on RIP1 expression because geldanamycin pretreatment completely inhibited NF-nB activation.
However, NF-nB activation was dispensable for TRAIL-induced
necrosis-like cell death at pHe 6.5. Moreover, z-IETD-fmk, an
inhibitor of caspase-8, which inhibited TRAIL-induced necrosislike cell death at pHe 6.5, did not inhibit NF-nB activation, suggesting that activation of NF-nB was not mediated by caspase-8
unlike what has been reported in other cell systems (26, 39). We
also observed that, at pHe 6.5, TRAIL treatment induced
IL-8 production (data not shown). As IL-8 production is usually
associated with inflammation, it is interesting to notice that
necrosis induced by TRAIL at acidic pHe could happen in a
proinflammatory context, which could be beneficial for stimulation of an antitumor immune response (2). It has also been
proposed that cell death through necrosis could be more
immunogenic than cell death through apoptosis (40).
As pHe of solid tumors is in most cases acidic (22), this new
TRAIL death pathway may have an important effect on TRAIL
efficiency in cancer therapy. We tested in this study an pHe
value that can be observed in vivo. HT29 colon tumors
xenografted in mice exhibit an acidic extracellular environment
3 or 4 weeks after cell injection (41) that could make it possible
for TRAIL to induce a necrosis-like cell death in vivo. However,
Ashkenazi et al. (42) have reported a typical apoptosis with
PARP cleavage in HCT-116 human colon tumors xenografted in
mice after TRAIL treatment. It is important to note that TRAIL

Surprisingly, RIP1 was not cleaved when the level of caspase8 activation was very high, suggesting either the subcellular
compartmentalization of caspase-8 or RIP1 or the inaccessibility
of the substrate RIP1. However, fractionation of HT29 cell lysates
in subcellular fractions (cytosolic, membrane, nuclear, and
cytoskeletal) after TRAIL treatment at acidic or physiologic pHe
did not show any particular subcellular compartmentalization
of caspase-8 or RIP1 at pHe 6.5 (data not shown). Modification
of RIP1 rendering the caspase cleavage site inaccessible might
be another possibility; about that point, it is worth noting that
phosphorylation of serine residues adjacent to the caspase-3
cleavage site of presinilin-2 has been reported to protect the
protein from cleavage (35). However, until now, RIP1 kinase has
been shown to autophosphorylate itself at serine/threonine

treatment began only 10 days after s.c. injection of HCT-116
cells, which could explain that, in this study, TRAIL mainly
triggered an apoptotic pathway in HCT-116-derived tumors.
Nevertheless, the relevance of this new cell death pathway
induced by TRAIL for cancer therapy requires further in vivo
investigations. In conclusion, our data suggest that TRAIL would
be more efficient for the treatment of solid tumors exhibiting an
acidic pHe.
