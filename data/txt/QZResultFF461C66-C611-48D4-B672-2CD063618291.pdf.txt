Abstract
TET-mediated 5-methyl cytosine (5mC) oxidation acts in epigenetic regulation, stem cell
development, and cancer. Hu et al. now determine the crystal structure of the TET2 catalytic
domain bound to DNA, shedding light on 5mC-DNA substrate recognition and the catalytic
mechanism of 5mC oxidation.

Substantial amounts of 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5hmC) have been observed in murine
embryonic stem cells and brain. The three Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET1-3) proteins have
been identified to act as 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)- and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases to
catalyze the oxidation of 5mC to 5hmC. TET dioxygenases can further oxidize 5hmC to 5formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC) in genomic DNA. 5caC can then be
recognized by thymine DNA glycosylase in DNA demethylation processes (Kohli and
Zhang, 2013). In this issue, Hu et al. (2013) determine the crystal structure of the TET2DNA complex to elucidate how TET dioxygenses may mediate 5mC oxidation and the
impact of TET2 clinical mutations.
Most missense TET2 mutations are in the catalytic domain. Hu et al. show that clinical
mutations found in human cancers decrease catalytic activity by affecting the 5mC
recognition, DNA interaction, and 2-OG/Fe(II) interactions in vitro and in vivo. Frequent
mutations of TET2 in leukemia suggest that TET2 helps regulate hematopoiesis and that
mutations impact cancer development. Although multiple mutations may be needed to cause
the clinical phenotype (Delhommeau et al., 2009), the TET2 structural analysis helps define
the connection between these mutations and disease phenotypes.

TET1−3 share similar catalytic activities and conserved C-terminal catalytic domains, which
contain a Cys-rich region and double-strand β-helix (DSBH) domain. The structure of TET2
catalytic domain with dsDNA reveals 5mC-DNA substrate recognition with bound Fe(II)
and Noxalylglycine [NOG, a 2-OG analogue]. The interesting intramolecular interaction of
Cys-rich and DSBH domains includes an unexpected domain swap between these domains.
This feature helps create a unique holder for DNA substrate recognition, in which both the
Cys-rich and DSBH domains bind DNA.

Only two other 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase-DNA complex structures, human ABH2 and
E. coli ALKB, have been previously known. Human ABH2 dioxygenase can repair by
oxidative demethylation several different methylated DNA modifications (1mA, 3mC, 1mG,
and 3mT) (Yi et al., 2012). Due to the instability of base-pairing, the methylated base is
flipped out. ABH2 uses Phe102 to probe the base lesion on DNA and Phe102 intercalates
into the duplex stack to ensure the methyl group is positioned in the catalytic cavity (Figure
1A) (Yang et al., 2008). According to this tipping mechanism (Figure 1A), the Phe102 tip
constantly probes for base-pair instability as DNA slides through the ABH2 protein.
Similarly, TET2 dioxygenase uses Tyr1294 to probe for base pair instability and this residue
intercalates into the duplex stack when a methylated cytosine is found. Mutation of Tyr1294
results in decreased activity. Hu et al. show that there is no binding difference between
5mCpG-DNA and 5CpG-DNA, implying that the methyl group does not impact DNA
binding. TET2 seems unlikely to discriminate 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC in the active site as long
as the 5mC derivatives are positioned correctly in the catalytic pocket next to Fe(II) and 2OG.

A different strategy is employed by E. coli AlkB dioxygenase, which detects base-pairing
instability by a squeezing mechanism. AlkB squeezes three bases of the lesion strand at a
time. Unstable base-pairs will flip out and gain stability by binding into the active site, with
subsequent repair occurring (Figure 1B) (Yang et al., 2008). Hu et al. show TET2 has a
greater preference to oxidize 5mCpG DNA than 5mCpC or 5mCpA. This suggests basepairing adjacent to the lesion is critical for activity. However, the crystal structure of TET2
did not show the sharp DNA bend made by AlkB. So TET2 does not employ the squeezing
mechanism to interrogate the lesion base but the tipping mechanism (Figure 1C). Yet, the
double mutations of TET2 Met1293 to Ala and Tyr1294 to Ala decrease DNA binding and
catalytic activity implicating these residues in CpG specificity. So it would be interesting to
see if the mutation of Tyr1294 to Phe can maintain the DNA binding and activity as a mimic
to ABH2.

Together ABH2-, AlkB-, and TET2-DNA complexes show the shared feature that the
modified base is sandwiched by an aromatic residue (Phe, Tyr, or Trp) and a cation residue
(His or Arg). In the analogous case of alkyltransferase-like protein (Atl1), Atl1 distinguishes
guanine from alkylated guanines using Arg69 cation-π interaction to probe the electrostatic
potential surface of O6-alkylguanine in the active site (Wilkinson et al., 2012). Arg1261 is
shown in TET2 structure to interact with co-substrate NOG and is critical for activity.
Furthermore, it may play another role to distinguish the methylated cytosine from cytosine
(Figure 1C). We therefore suggest a testable hypothesis in which Arg1261 cation-π stacking
electrostatic interactions may help distinguish 5C from other 5mC derivatives as analogous
π stacking acts in distinguishing alkyl-G within its large pocket in Atl1. This sophisticated
recognition approach could minimize detection and repairing errors and help maximize the
accuracy of DNA demethylation, which is critical in gene regulation and cell development.
TET proteins play a crucial role in the maintenance of 5hmC. But how do TET proteins find
specific genes? TET1 and TET3 contain an N-terminal CXXC domain, which preferentially
binds CpG-rich DNA. TET1 and TET3 may use the CXXC domain to search CpG DNA.
TET2 lost its N-terminal CXXC domain during evolution; however, due to a chromosomal
inversion event, a neighboring gene in vertebrates named IDAX (also known as CXXC4)
contains the CXXC domain and targets TET2 (Ko et al., 2013). So IDAX interactions with
TET2 may allow it to search CpG DNA for its 5mC substrates (Ko et al., 2013).
Interestingly, an analogous partnership is seen for ABH3 dioxygenase: the ASCC3 helicase
couples with the ABH3 to promote 3mC-DNA demethylation. ASCC3 opens dsDNA
(Dango et al., 2011) to allow ABH3 to search for DNA damage (Dango et al., 2011;
Sundheim et al., 2006). The crystal structure of TET2 opens doors for both understanding

and predicting the role of TET proteins in gene regulation and cell development. It will be
exciting to see how the CXXC domain interacts with TET proteins and how TET proteins
regulate gene expression.
