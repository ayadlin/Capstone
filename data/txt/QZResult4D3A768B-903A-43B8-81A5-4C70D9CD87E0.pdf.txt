BACKGROUND. A long-term follow-up was conducted of 18 patients with a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma treated with a combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine (CVD).

METHODS. The study design was a nonrandomized, single-arm trial conducted at
a government medical referral center. Eighteen patients with metastatic malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma were studied. After controlling symptoms of catecholamine excess, patients were treated with cyclophosphamide at
750 mg/m2, vincristine at 1.4 mg/m2, and dacarbazine at 600 mg/m2 on Day 1
and dacarbazine at 600 mg/m2 on Day 2, every 21 to 28 days.
RESULTS. Combination chemotherapy with CVD produced a complete response
rate of 11% and a partial response rate of 44%. Median survival from a landmark
was 3.8 years for patients whose tumors responded to therapy and 1.8 years for
patients whose tumors did not respond (P 5 .65). All patients with tumors scored

well tolerated with only grade I/II toxicities.

CONCLUSIONS. Combination chemotherapy with CVD produced objective tumor
responses in patients with advanced malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. In this 22-year follow-up there was no difference in overall survival between
patients whose tumors objectively shrank and those with stable or progressive disease. However, patients reported improvement in symptoms, had objective
improvements in blood pressure, and had tumor shrinkage that made surgical
resection possible. The authors conclude that CVD therapy is not indicated in every
patient with metastatic pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, but should be considered in the management of patients with symptoms and where tumor shrinkage
might be beneficial. Cancer 2008;113:2020–8.  2008 American Cancer Society.

atecholamine-secreting tumors—pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas—are rare neoplasms that arise from chromaffin
tissue of the adrenal medulla and the sympathetic ganglia. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas occur in 2 to 8 people per
million and <1% of patients with hypertension.1-8 The peak incidence occurs during the fourth and fifth decades of life.9 Lacking
reliable morphological or histological criteria, the diagnosis of
malignancy depends on clinical behavior.10-12 Depending on the
genetic background and location, 3% to 36% of pheochromocytomas/

paraganglioma are malignant.13-16 The rate of malignancy is much higher in patients with paraganglioma
who have mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase
subunit B.17-22
Most presenting signs and symptoms of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma result from catecholamine excess, with patients often presenting with
paroxysms of severe hypertension or tachycardia.
However, about 20% to 30% of patients can be asymptomatic or present with only mild hypertension.23-26
The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma
is confirmed by biochemical evidence of elevated catecholamine and metanephrine production, usually
corroborated by radiologic studies.10,23,24,27
The most effective method of treatment for pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma is surgical resection.28-30
Patients with surgically resected benign pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma have an overall survival equal to
an age-matched normal population. However, patients
with malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma
have a 5-year survival <50% that of age-matched controls.31-34
A combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine,
and dacarbazine (CVD) is often used as initial chemotherapy for malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, based on a study that reported a high response
rate and improvement in symptoms.35 Cognizant of
the paucity of long-term follow-ups, we now report a
22-year follow-up of 18 patients with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, including 14 in the original
report, treated with CVD at a single institution.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
From August 1983 to December 1995, 18 patients with
malignant pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma confirmed by pathology and clinical course consented to
receive chemotherapy. Eligibility requirements were
described previously.35 Fourteen patients enrolled in
the original study and 4 additional patients who met
eligibility criteria and were treated similarly are
included in this analysis. All patients had metastatic
disease. Additional criteria for entry included elevated
plasma or urinary catecholamines, metanephrines, or
vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA); measurable disease, no
previous chemotherapy, recovery from previous radiation therapy, including targeted radiotherapy with 131Imetaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG); adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] >3.5 3
109/L and platelet count >100 3 109/L), renal function,
and hepatic function, with Karnofsky performance status >30%. Patients had to be able to provide informed
consent and to be accessible for follow-up.

Drug Therapy
Before starting CVD, various drugs were administered
to control symptoms of catecholamine excess and
maintain a normal blood pressure and heart rate. Initial treatment consisted of oral phenoxybenzamine,
an a-adrenergic blocker, in doses up to 240 mg/day,
usually in combination with a b-adrenergic blocker,
propranolol or atenolol. If the blood pressure
remained elevated, up to 2.0 g/day metyrosine, a catecholamine synthesis inhibitor, was administered
orally. Some patients also received a1-adrenergic or
calcium channel blockers to achieve adequate blood
pressure control. The combination chemotherapy regimen consisted of intravenous cyclophosphamide
(750 mg/m2), vincristine (1.4 mg/m2), and dacarbazine (600 mg/m2) on Day 1 and dacarbazine alone
(600 mg/m2) on Day 2 every 21 to 28 days. The cyclophosphamide doses were adjusted according to the
ANC nadir in the previous cycle, and ANC <500 was
the goal to be achieved for the myelosuppression.
Treatment Evaluation
Patients had an initial complete history and physical
examination with laboratory studies and received
antihypertensive and analgesic therapy. At least 2
separate 24-hour urine collections were obtained for
baseline catecholamines, metanephrines, and VMA
determination. Initial radiologic and nuclear medicine studies included chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis,
bone scan, and whole-body 131I-MIBG scan. Laboratory tests were repeated every 3 to 4 weeks throughout the treatment. Radiology and nuclear medicine
studies were repeated every 6 to 16 weeks, if the
original studies were abnormal.
Tumor response was based on the sum of the
products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable tumors and graded as complete response
(complete regression of all clinical evidence of disease), partial response (at least 50% reduction), minimal response (at least 25% but not greater than 50%
reduction), no change, and progression (the appearance of a new lesion or an increase in the size by
25%). Biochemical response was based upon the
24-hour urinary catecholamines, metanephrines, and
VMA, as reported previously.35
Statistical Methods
Survival durations were calculated in 3 different
ways: 1) from date of diagnosis until date of death or
last follow-up; 2) from on-study date until date of
death or last follow-up; and 3) to estimate survival
for patients whose tumors responded to treatment
versus those whose tumors did not respond, a land-

mark analysis was done in which a date 3 months after starting therapy was selected as the starting point
for survival, because this would permit an unbiased
conditional estimate of the survival for these 2
groups of patients.36 In each case, the Kaplan-Meier
method was used to estimate the probability of survival as a function of time. The Mantel-Haenszel
method was used to determine the statistical significance of the difference between a pair of KaplanMeier curves; the P value reported is from a 2-tailed
test.37,38

Patient 1
In 1991, a 42-year-old man presented with recurrent
episodes of hematuria, hypertension, palpitations, diaphoresis, and headaches. CT scan revealed a 5.5 3
7.5 3 8.0-cm mass invading the urinary bladder
posteriorly with right-sided hydronephrosis. Biopsy
obtained via cystoscopy revealed a paraganglioma
with many mitotic figures in the urinary bladder. The
tumor was felt to be unresectable, and he was trea-

ted with 9 fractions of radiotherapy (RT) (1900 centigrays) without response.
The patient was referred for chemotherapy. His
blood pressure was 142 over 92 mm Hg on phenoxybenzamine 20 mg twice a day, metyrosine 50 mg 3
times a day, verapamil 240 mg daily, and Maxzide 25
mg daily. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before
chemotherapy showed an enhancing mass in the
posterior wall of the urinary bladder confluent with
the prostate (Fig. 1 Pre-CVD). A 24-hour urinary test
showed catecholamine at 889 lg (normal range 0115 lg/24 h), metanephrines at 8.8 mg (normal range
<0.9 mg/24 h), and VMA at 25 mg (normal range
2-10 mg/24 h). A 131I-MIBG scan showed increased
activity in the bladder area.
The patient began CVD chemotherapy in July
1992, and after 2 cycles an MRI scan showed a
decrease in the tumor size. After 6 cycles, urinary
catecholamines had decreased to 43 lg, metanephrines to 3.8 mg, and VMA to 10.1 mg, and the
product of the perpendicular diameters was less than

CVD for Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma/Huang et al

20% of the original value (Fig. 1 Post-CVD). In
February 1993 the patient underwent a radical cystectomy with an ileal conduit. Postsurgery, urinary
catecholamines, metanephrines, and VMA returned
to normal.
Regular follow-ups were unremarkable until
March 1997, when multiple lung metastases and a
0.5-cm lesion in the right fourth rib were found on a
CT scan. The patient reported increasing symptoms
of catecholamine excess, and was hypertensive, with
24-hour urinary catecholamine of 298 lg, metanephrines of 1.8 mg, and VMA of 10.2 mg. He was
restarted on phenoxybenzamine at 20 mg, with
improvement in symptoms and normalization of
blood pressure, and serial CT scans showed slowed
progression of disease. In December 1999 the patient
developed increasing right rib pain with an enlarging
lesion at the fourth rib. He underwent radiofrequency ablation of the rib metastasis and did well
until April 2001, when symptoms again increased,
and CT showed new pelvic, rectum, and sigmoid
masses. Therapy with CVD was restarted, but continued disease progression, especially in the liver, led to
his death in August 2002.

Patient 2
A 48-year-old woman was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma in 1985 when she presented with palpitations, headache, sweating, and hypertension.
Evaluation showed a left adrenal mass that was
resected. She did well until 1988, when she developed bone pain, and a bone scan found increased
uptake in the thoracolumbar spine. With symptomatic treatment, she did well until 1990, when multiple pulmonary metastases were found, and she was
referred for chemotherapy.
At initial evaluation blood pressure was 140 over
98 mm Hg on 50 mg atenolol, 250 mg metyrosine,
and 10 mg phenoxybenzamine twice daily. A 24-hour
urine showed elevated catecholamines (470 lg),
metanephrines (l3 mg), and VMA (15.5 mg). CT scan
showed multiple pulmonary nodules and osteolytic
lesions in T11-12 and L1-5. Bone scan showed metastatic lesions involving the spine, pelvis, skull, and
ribs. A 131I-MIBG scan showed diffuse, increased
uptake in the thoracolumbar area.
The patient was started on CVD in September
1990, and her first cycle was complicated by cardiogenic shock after the administration of the chemotherapy. Cycles 2 and 3 administered in the intensive
care unit were associated with transient hypotension,
and after a fourth inpatient cycle, she went on to
receive 62 cycles as an outpatient. After 6 cycles, her
performance status improved, and the intensity of

bone scan lesions were reduced, and after 25 cycles
vincristine was discontinued because of neurotoxicity. With further therapy, the patient continued to
have stable disease. However, because of continued
stress, chemotherapy was stopped in February 1995
when the 24-hour urinary catecholamine was 113 lg,
metanephrines 5.4 mg, and VMA 8.8 mg, and 131IMIBG and bone scan showed marked improvement.
She did well off chemotherapy until March 2001,
when she received palliative RT for a right shoulder
bony metastasis, but otherwise proceeded with evidence of gradual disease progression until July 2002,
when she died suddenly. An autopsy revealed an unusual variant of anomalous coronary circulation consisting of a single left coronary ostium giving rise to
an attenuated right coronary artery passing intramurally through the anterior aortic wall, representing
the predisposing cause of death. Additional autopsy
findings included the multifocal bilateral lung metastases and a single liver metastasis. Although a complete survey of the skeleton was not undertaken, no
bony disease was identified in the vertebral column.

All patients had metastatic disease. Nine patients
had a diagnosis of paraganglioma. Six patients had
previous treatment to localized sites with radiation.
Commonly used antihypertensives included phenoxybenzamine, propanolol, atenolol, prazosin, and
clonidine.

Tumor and Biochemical Response
As of July 2007, all patients were evaluable for tumor
and biochemical responses, as shown in Table 3. Two

(11%) patients had a complete tumor response, 8
(44%) had a partial tumor response, and 3 (16%) had a
minimal response. Biochemical responses were seen
in 13 (72%) of the patients, including all patients with
complete, partial, and minimal tumor responses.
Among the patients whose tumors responded to the
treatment, although most responded after 2 to 4
cycles, in 1 patient a tumor response was not recorded
until after Cycle 6. The median duration of response is
20 months (Table 4). The median potential follow-up
is now 22 years. One patient remains alive, and 1 was

CVD for Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma/Huang et al

lost to follow-up after 5 years. There are 16 confirmed
deaths. As shown in Figure 2, the median survival for
all patients from the on-study date is 3.3 years. Median
survival from date of diagnosis is 6.5 years. Median
survival from the landmark date (3 months after starting chemotherapy) is 3.8 years for patients whose
tumors had a complete or partial response to chemotherapy and 1.8 years for the rest. The 2-tailed logrank P value for the comparison of the 2 curves,
according to response category, is .65.

Treatment Tolerability and Toxicity
As one might expect, patients whose tumors
responded favorably remained on study longer.
Patients whose tumors were scored as complete or
partial response received a mean of 27.4 cycles of
CVD and a median of 23. In the patients whose
tumors did not respond to CVD treatment, the mean
and median numbers of treatment cycles were 8.75
and 5.5, respectively. Initially, cyclophosphamide
doses were escalated; however, if a patient had a nadir ANC less than 0.5 3 109/L on 3 measurements or
a platelet count less than 25 3 109/L, the dose in the

subsequent cycle was reduced 20% to 50%. The
chemotherapy dose administered as a percentage of
that planned was 80.0%, 74.7%, and 80.7% for cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine, respectively, in those whose tumors were scored as
complete or partial response, and 81.3%, 78.4%, and
93.4% in those without a tumor response or with
only minimal shrinkage. The median dose of cyclophosphamide administered in the first 5 cycles compared with that in cycles beyond 5 were 100% and
76% of the planned dose for those patients whose
tumors responded to therapy and 100% and 69% of
the planned dose for those whose tumors were
scored as not responding. The percentage for vincristine in patients with a response is similar to patients
without a response. One patient received 43 cycles of
vincristine at a full dose of 1.4 mg/m2 every cycle,
for a cumulative dose of 60 mg/m2. Another patient
received 36 cycles of vincristine at close to full dose
without significant neurological side effects, and 2
other patients received 21 cycles at almost full dose.

As reported previously,35 the common toxicities
encountered were myelosuppression, peripheral neuropathy, and gastrointestinal toxicity. Four episodes
of hypotension in the first 3 cycles of treatment were
observed, and they occurred 3 to 5 days after treatment started. In 1 patient, described above as Patient
2, hypotension occurred in the setting of cardiogenic
shock; otherwise all other episodes were easily corrected with volume replacement. Overall the treatment was well tolerated.

DISCUSSION
Up to about 36% of all catecholamine-secreting tumors
are malignant,13-16 with local invasion or distant metastasis the only reliable clues of malignancy. The most
effective treatment remains surgical resection. Although
prognosis in confirmed malignancy is difficult to predict, the average 5-year survival with metastases is
approximately 50%.30,33,39,40 Although pharmacological
control of catecholamine excess and judicious RT provide symptomatic relief and improve well-being, these
measures are eventually inadequate, underscoring the
need for systemic therapies. We describe the long-term
follow-up of 18 patients with pheochromocytoma/
paraganglioma treated with CVD and make recommendations for managing these patients, who are often very
difficult to manage medically.
The literature suggests there are 2 subsets of
patients with malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma with distinct clinical courses and outcomes.32,34,41,42 Approximately half have a relatively
rapid course, dying within 4 to 5 years of diagnosis.32
The remaining half present a more indolent course
and live 20 or more years without cytotoxic therapy.
Twelve of our patients had an aggressive course, with
early mortality and significant morbidity as a result
of tumor dissemination. By comparison, 6 presented
a more indolent course, living more than 10 years,
including 2 for more than 20 years.
The CVD regimen was originally chosen because
its component drugs were effective in neuroblastoma.43,44 As reiterated here, the regimen is active in
patients with malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. Fifty-five percent of patients had a tumor
response, and 72% had a biochemical response. The
median duration of response was 20 months. Four
patients previously treated with radiation had objective tumor or biochemical responses, which is somewhat surprising because most in vitro and in vivo
models would predict some degree of cross-resistance between radiation and both cyclophosphamide
and alkylating agents, such as dacarbazine, although
a lack of cross-resistance has also been noted.45-47

The biochemical response correlated closely with
tumor response determined by standard criteria and
mediated objective improvements in performance
status and blood pressure. Biochemical markers were
useful in confirming tumor response, relapse, and
progression in all the patients except 1. Pending confirmation, it can be argued that serial urine collections may be as sensitive if not more so in following
patients whose tumors secrete catecholamines,
obviating the need for at least some imaging studies.
In addition, functional imaging studies such as 131IMIBG scintigraphy and 18F-fluorodopamine positron
emission tomography can help clarify whether abnormalities seen on CT scan retain active tumor cells.
For example, an 18F-fluorodopamine scan showed residual disease in the mediastinum and abdomen of
the patient who is still alive 32 years after diagnosis
and 18 years after commencing chemotherapy.
As previously reported, CVD was well tolerated, as
evidenced by the ability to administer a median of 23
cycles to patients with an objective response. Side
effects occurred without significant sequelae and
were generally not dose limiting, except in 2 patients
in whom vincristine was discontinued after 3 and 25
cycles because of peripheral neuropathy. One patient
had cardiogenic shock after receiving chemotherapy—a result of tachyphylaxis after massive catecholamine discharge—and was treated with intravenous
phentolamine. Oncologists should be aware that several drugs (Table 5), including several commonly used
in oncologic practice, are contraindicated in patients
with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma.48 Episodes
of massive spontaneous catecholamine discharge

CVD for Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma/Huang et al

after drug administration argue for the administration
of the first cycle with close monitoring, possibly in
collaboration with an endocrinologist.
Should CVD be administered routinely to
patients with unresectable pheochromocytoma? The
median survival from the landmark date 3 months
after starting chemotherapy is 3.8 years for patients
with objective tumor responses and 1.8 years for
nonresponders. However, the 2-tailed log-rank P
value for the comparison of the 2 curves, according
to response category, was .65. Thus, based upon
long-term follow-up, there is no statistically significant difference in overall survival (OS) between
patients whose tumors responded to therapy compared with those whose tumors did not respond. The
lack of statistical significance in OS may be attributed to the small number of patients treated with
CVD. In the absence of larger numbers, we would
argue that an appropriate strategy would be to treat
patients with CVD if their disease is symptomatic, either because of difficulty controlling the symptoms
of catecholamine excess pharmacologically or as a
result of painful metastases. We would also propose
one may try this therapy in a neo-adjuvant approach
to render a tumor amenable to surgical resection, as
was achieved in Patient 1. But we would not advocate at present that all patients receive CVD in the
face of metastases. The long-term survival of many
patients with metastases counsels a prudent
approach guided by the clinical course. We would
argue that patients with an indication for starting
therapy who benefit from CVD continue therapy
indefinitely, provided the patient is tolerating the
therapy well and symptomatic improvement has
been obtained.
As for patients previously treated with CVD, we
would note anecdotally that in several patients reinstitution of CVD has been ineffective, even when
therapy had been discontinued without evidence of
progressive disease. Other chemotherapy regimens
tested in small numbers of patients with various
response rates include cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil,49
etoposide, carboplatin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and adriamycin,50 a modified CVD regimen
adding an anthracycline,51 and oral temozolomide.52
Administration of these regimens should be balanced
against recommending enrollment in a clinical trial,
the option we encourage.
Finally, we would note that recent advances
identifying genetic factors predisposing to pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma might further clarify the
clinical behavior and response to therapy. It would
not be surprising to find that genetic factors underlie
a better or worse prognosis or response to chemo-

therapy. Unfortunately, enrollment of our patients in
the distant past precluded a genetic analysis.
In summary, this report shows that CVD provides
effective palliation in patients with progressive,
advanced malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma without a clear impact on OS. Most patients
with an objective response were clinically better in
the opinions of treating physicians and had
decreased requirements or discontinuation of blood
pressure medications. We recommend that this effective, well-tolerated regimen be reserved for patients
with metastases with symptoms not controlled medically, patients with unresectable disease in an
attempt to render their disease resectable, and
patients with rapidly growing tumors. Further investigations should identify therapies that will result in
higher response rates and perhaps increased survival.
