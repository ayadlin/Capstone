he report of prognostic factors in patients with anterior skull
base sarcoma undergoing craniofacial resection by Gil et al. is a
subanalysis of the data accrued by the International Collaborative
Study Group.1 These data were collected retrospectively from
patients who were treated between 1956 and 2000, from 17 different
treatment sites, and only from those patients who were deemed
candidates for craniofacial resection using institution-speciﬁc (nonstandardized) selection criteria. Therefore, the data cannot be generalized to the full population of patients with primary sarcoma
affecting the skull base. Other signiﬁcant drawbacks to the study by
Gil et al. were the lack of centralized pathologic review and the
ﬁnding that 63 of 146 patients (43%) had tumors that could not be
classiﬁed pathologically. Although this has been a well-recognized
problem in other reports of head and neck and skull base sarcomas,
the particularly high incidence of unclassiﬁed tumors in their report
further hampers the generalization of its conclusions.2–4 This having
been said, there is no question that their report conﬁrms many of
the ﬁndings of previous reports (referenced in Gil et al.) on sarcomas of the head and neck and skull base. Speciﬁcally, it supports
the determination by the International Consensus Symposium on
the diagnosis and treatment of adult soft tissue sarcoma that wide
surgical resection with negative margins is the treatment of choice
for soft tissue sarcoma of the head and neck.5
Adjuvant radiotherapy, although it was received by only 34% of
the cohort reported by Gil et al., did not affect disease-speciﬁc survival statistically. In the series reported by Prabhu et al., 62% of
their 63 patients with primary skull base sarcoma received postoperative radiotherapy, but those authors also were unable to identify a statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁt in either progression-free
survival or overall survival.3 However, single-institution, randomized
trials have demonstrated improved local control with the addition
of radiation to surgical resection for patients with extremity soft tissue sarcoma.6,7 Therefore, in my opinion, it is reasonable to consider the addition of postoperative radiation in high-grade soft
tissue sarcomas of the skull base given the necessarily close margins
of resection that typically are achieved.
Much less clear is the role, if any, of adjuvant or neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, either in efforts to affect survival or in organ-sparing

approaches. A multi-institutional cohort analysis of
anthracycline-based preoperative or postoperative
chemotherapy for advanced-stage soft tissue sarcoma revealed a statistically signiﬁcant, inferior overall survival8; whereas other studies identiﬁed small,
high-risk subsets of patients who may have a survival improvement with the use of preoperative,
anthracycline-based chemotherapy.9 The overall
consensus, however, is that the clinical beneﬁt from
adjuvant, anthracycline-based chemotherapy, if it
exists, is small; and, when the signiﬁcant toxicities
of treatment are considered, the therapeutic ratio
is even smaller.10 The results of organ-sparing approaches with these agents also are not inspiring.
In 1 report, preoperative treatments with either
anthracycline- and/or ifosfamide-based, preoperative
chemotherapy resulted in a 34% response rate but a
decrease in the scope of anticipated surgery in only
13% of patients. Of the 26% of patients who progressed on chemotherapy, 9% had disease progression signiﬁcant enough to increase the scope of
surgery.11 The use of adjuvant chemotherapy, as
recommended aptly by Gil et al., should be reserved
for clinical trials or palliative settings in patients
with inoperable tumors or metastatic disease.
Much work remains to be accomplished if we
are going to make an impact on the outcome of
patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the skull base.
International collaborations, like the one that produced the report by Gil et al., are essential as are the
formation of cooperative groups and collaborations
with industry to study newer agents.12 Trials based
on individual pathologic subtypes will be necessary
and can be accomplished only with the cooperative
efforts of investigators around the globe. I commend
Gil et al. and the International Collaborative Study
Group for taking important steps to achieve these
goals.
