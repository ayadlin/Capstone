ABSTRACT
Acquired resistance to lapatinib, an inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 kinases, is
common. We found that reactivation of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 occurred within 24
hours of lapatinib treatment after their initial dephosphorylation. This was associated
with increased expression of NRG1 in cells treated with lapatinib. Exogenous NRG1
partially rescued breast cancer cells from growth inhibition by lapatinib. In addition,
both parental and lapatinib-resistant breast cancer cells were sensitive to SGP1, which
inhibits binding of NRG1 and other HER3 ligands. Addition of pertuzumab to lapatinib
further inhibited NRG1-induced signalling, which was not fully inhibited by either
drug alone. In animal model, a combination of pertuzumab to lapatinib induced a
greater tumor regression than either lapatinib or pertuzumab monotherapy. This novel
combination treatment may provide a promising strategy in clinical HER2-targeted
therapy and may inhibit a subset of lapatinib-resistant breast cancer, although the
group of patients that will respond to this therapy requires further stratification.

INTRODUCTION

emtansine (T-DM1, an antibody-drug conjugate) and
lapatinib (TKI) were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and the European Medicines Agency and
are now used in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.
Trastuzumab is also used in HER2-positive gastric
patients.
Pertuzumab is a humanised mAb that binds to the
dimerisation domain (subdomain II) of the extracellular
region of HER2, preventing its dimerisation with other
HER receptors and thus inhibiting the HER signalling
pathway [6, 7]. In preclinical studies, pertuzumab
was found to inhibit NRG1-induced growth [8] and
morphogenesis in vitro, and trigger rapid tumour
regression in NRG1-dependent xenograft model [9]. The
combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab was shown
to be synergistic in inhibiting the survival of HER2overexpressing breast cancer cell line BT-474 [10]. In

The human epidermal growth factor receptor
(HER, also known as ErbB) family consists of four
transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases, EGFR,
HER2, HER3 and HER4 [1]. Dysregulation of the
HER signalling pathway has been implicated in various
epithelial cancers; for example, breast cancer, head and
neck, and lung cancers [2]. Overexpression of HER2
protein and/or amplification of the HER2 gene occurs in
around 20% of breast cancer patients and correlates with
adverse prognosis and poor clinical outcome [3, 4]. HER2
overexpression correlates with tumour size, lymph node
positivity, high tumour grade and aneuploidy [5]. There
are two main types of HER2-targeted therapy: monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
[3]. Trastuzumab, pertuzumab (mAbs), trastuzumab

conjunction with chemotherapy, this combination has
been shown to prolong PFS compared to trastuzumab
in metastatic breast cancer as first line treatment [11]
and improve pathological complete response (pCR)
when used as a neoadjuvant therapy in early breast
cancer [12]. Therefore, the FDA has approved the use
of the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab with
chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer and early HER2overexpressing breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.
Lapatinib is a small molecule chemical inhibitor
designed to target the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of
EGFR and HER2 [13, 14]. Lapatinib reversibly binds
to the ATP-binding pocket of the TKD and prevents
phosphorylation [14]. It has been proven successful in
inhibiting the phosphorylation of HER receptors and its
downstream targets such as Akt and MAPK [14, 15],
and slowing down tumour growth in vitro and in vivo
[13, 14]. Lapatinib is used in patients with advanced
HER2-positive breast cancer that have progressed
after previous trastuzumab containing regimens and its
efficacy as a single targeted therapy with chemotherapy
has been shown [16, 17]. Lapatinib in combination with
trastuzumab and chemotherapy has been reviewed in
neoadjuvant studies such as CHER-LOB [18], NSABP
B-41 [19] and neoALTTO trials [20]. Recently, a metaanalysis of six randomised trials had concluded that
lapatinib in combination with chemotherapy achieved
a lower pCR and higher risk of toxicity compared to
trastuzumab with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant
setting [21]. Furthermore, a phase III study reported in
the 2012 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual
Meeting found that, metastatic HER2-positive breast
cancer patients who received lapatinib and chemotherapy
had shorter PFS than those receiving trastuzumab and
chemotherapy [22].
Several models have been proposed to explain
the resistance to lapatinib in HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer. Lapatinib derepresses FOXO3a, which
stimulates oestrogen receptor (ER) transcription and leads
to the co-dependence on ER and HER2 signalling [23].
Lapatinib activates ER-induced overexpression of AXL,
which stimulates downstream PI3K/Akt pathway and
promotes survival [24]. Derepression of FOXO3a also
upregulates HER3 [25]. Lapatinib triggers a calcium stress
response that activates RelA, which inhibits apoptosis
[26]. Recently, Xia et al. reported that NRG1 autocrine
stimulation of EGFR/HER3 signalling mediates acquired
lapatinib resistance [27], although the exact mechanism
was not elucidated.
Here, we report that NRG1 stimulation activated
HER3 and HER4 signalling despite the inhibition incurred
by lapatinib. However, a novel combination of HER2targeted therapies, lapatinib and pertuzumab, inhibited
these NRG1-stimulated HER signalling pathways. The
anti-tumour activity of this drug combination was verified
in vitro and in vivo and was confirmed to be more efficient
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

than either drug alone.

RESULTS
Lapatinib could not sustain the inhibition of
HER receptor signalling and upregulates NRG1
expression
To assess the acute response that may counteract
lapatinib inhibition, we treated two commonly used
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, SK-BR-3
and BT-474, with lapatinib for 24 hours. After 4 hours of
lapatinib treatment, the phosphorylation of EGFR, HER2
and HER3 in both cell lines was reduced. However, these
receptors started to rephosphorylate after 8 to 24 hours
whilst on treatment (Fig. 1A and B). In SK-BR-3 cells,
the phosphorylation of downstream effectors of the HER
signalling pathway, MAPK and Akt, were inhibited
by lapatinib after 1 hour, but started to recover after 24
hours of lapatinib treatment (Fig. 1A). In BT-474 cells,
the dephosphorylation and reactivation of Akt correlated
with its upstream HER3 receptor in a similar way to
SK-BR-3, but it was more robust and rapid in BT-474.
However, phospho-MAPK followed a different pattern
(Fig. 1B). The phosphorylation of MAPK decreased to an
undetectable level after 1 hour of treatment; however, it
rose to near basal level at 4 hours and decreased again
from 8 to 24 hours.
Xia et al. (2013) reported a model of acquired
lapatinib resistance, in which EGFR/HER3 signalling was
induced by NRG1 autocrine stimulation [27]. However,
the short-term effect of lapatinib on NRG1 expression
was not shown. We hypothesised that the reactivation
of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 as well as the downstream
pathways during the first 24 hours of lapatinib treatment
could be mediated by NRG1. We showed that lapatinib
treatment in 100 nM and 250 nM for 8 hours induced
an increasing trend of NRG1 mRNA expression in SKBR-3 cells (Fig. 1C), although the increase was not
statistically significant. In BT-474 cells, NRG1 mRNA
level increased significantly after the cells were treated
with 250 nM lapatinib for 8 hours (p<0.05) but not with
100 nM lapatinib (Fig. 1D). We further confirmed that
there was a small but statistically significant increase in
NRG1 protein expression upon lapatinib treatment using
ELISA. In SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells, both 100 nM and
250 nM lapatinib increased NRG1 expression in the cell
lysates (Fig. 1E and F, all p <0.0001 compared to DMSO).
However, NRG1 level in the medium was too low to be
detected by ELISA (data not shown).

addition of SGP1 to lapatinib was more effective than
lapatinib alone in the parental BT-474 cells and not SKBR-3 cells, although this was not more effective than
SGP1 alone in BT-474 cells (Fig. 2A and B). We generated
lapatinib-resistant cell lines from HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3 and BT-474 by chronic
lapatinib treatment up to the concentration of 250 nM over
10 months. The resistant cell lines had reduced sensitivity
to lapatinib treatment (Suppl. Fig. 1). In the resistant
cells, there was an increase of cell number when lapatinib
was withdrawn in BT250LR cells (Fig. 2D) but not in

Since NRG1 level was shown to be increased
during the first 8 hours of lapatinib treatment (Figure 1E
and F) and it has also been shown to mediate acquired
lapatinib resistance [27], we assessed the effect of HER3
monoclonal antibody, SGP1, that could block HER3
ligands from binding the receptors [28] in both parental
and lapatinib-resistant SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells. SGP1
alone or lapatinib alone reduced the cell number of the
parental SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells significantly (both

SK250LR cells (Fig. 2C). SGP1 with or without lapatinib
withdrawal could reduce the cell number significantly in
both resistant cells (Fig. 2C and D). Thus, we showed that
both parental and resistant SK-BR-3 and BT474 cells were
sensitive to SGP1, which inhibits binding of NRG1 and
other HER3 ligands.

lapatinib decreased the cell number significantly
(p<0.0001 compared to DMSO in both cell lines), but the
addition of NRG1 to lapatinib treatment recovered the
cell number to the control level (p<0.0001 compared to
lapatinib alone in both cell lines) (Suppl. Fig. 2A and B).
The above results provided evidence that NRG1, a HER3
ligand, rescues HER2-overexpressing cell lines SK-BR-3
and BT-474 cells from the inhibitory effect of lapatinib.

resistance, no effective treatment option has been
proposed [27]. NRG1 is a ligand for HER3 and HER4,
and the release of NRG1 and other HER ligands could
induce HER2 dimerisation with other HER receptors [1].
This is supported by a report that lapatinib could increase
HER2/HER3 and EGFR/HER2 dimerisation [29]. Thus,

we hypothesised that the HER2 dimerisation inhibitor,
pertuzumab, could inhibit NRG1-mediated HER receptor
signalling induced by lapatinib treatment [30].
In serum-free media, lapatinib inhibited
phosphorylation of all HER receptors and the downstream
Akt and MAPK in both parental cell lines (Fig. 3A and B).

When the cells were stimulated by NRG1, lapatinib could
still inhibit phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2; however,
there was an increase in phosphorylation of HER3, HER4,
MAPK and Akt compared to lapatinib alone. These results
suggested that NRG1 stimulation could partially reverse
the inhibition induced by lapatinib. We showed that
pertuzumab alone did not inhibit any HER receptors nor
downstream targets analysed in both SK-BR-3 and BT474 cells; however, in the presence of NRG1 stimulation,
pertuzumab inhibited phospho-EGFR, phospho-HER2 and
phospho-HER4 (Fig. 3A and B). This result indicated that
pertuzumab inhibited as well as decreased NRG1-induced
HER3 activation ligand-induced HER signalling in these
cells.
When the cells were stimulated by NRG1, the
combination of lapatinib and pertuzumab inhibited
phospho-HER3, phospho-HER4, phospho-Akt and
phospho-MAPK more than lapatinib alone. Both

phospho-HER3 and phospho-HER4 were inhibited to
levels comparable to no NRG1 stimulation in SK-BR-3
cells (Fig. 3A). Phospho-Akt and phospho-MAPK in SKBR-3 cells were still higher than basal levels when NRG1stimulated cells were treated with the combination (Fig.
3A); however, in BT-474 cells, both downstream effectors
were completely inhibited (Fig. 3B). This experiment
showed that the combination of lapatinib and pertuzumab
could inhibit NRG1-stimulated HER signalling pathways,
which were not completely inhibited by either drug alone.

pertuzumab in vitro
The additive effect of the combination of lapatinib
and pertuzumab on the inhibition of NRG1-stimulated

have improved anti-tumour activity. In total cell counting
experiments, the combination of lapatinib and pertuzumab
(blue line) was shown to reduce total cell number more
than lapatinib alone at any concentration (red line) and
pertuzumab alone (green dashed line) in both SK-BR-3
and BT-474 cells (Fig. 3C and D). The difference between
the combination and lapatinib alone was significant in
both SK-BR-3 (p<0.001) and BT-474 (p<0.0001) cells,
suggesting the combination effect of the two drugs may
be additive.
The additive effect of the drug combination was
further confirmed by an apoptotic assay. Although the
combination of lapatinib and pertuzumab induced the
highest percentage of apoptotic cells in both cell lines,
the change was only statistically significant compared to

lapatinib alone (+IgG control) in BT474 but not SK-BR-3
cells (Suppl. Fig. 3A and B and Suppl. Fig. 4). However,
the combination was significantly more effective than
pertuzumab alone in both cell lines. In order to further
understand the differences between the two cell lines, the
effect of the drug combination was investigated in the
lapatinib-resistant cell lines as below.

Effect of the combination of lapatinib and
pertuzumab in lapatinib-resistant cell lines
The drug combination was tested on lapatinibresistant cell lines SK250LR and BT250LR to understand
whether this could overcome acquired lapatinib resistance.

before being immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. Reproducible representative results of at least three independent experiments are
shown. (C) SK250LR and (D) BT250LR were either continuously treated with 250 nM lapatinib treatment (solid bars, Cont) or had
withdrawal of the drug (hollow bars, 7DW) for 7 days before they were re-seeded to 24-well plates. Cells were then treated with DMSO
or 250 nM lapatinib for 3 days, and then trypsinised and counted. The percentage of cell number was normalised to the cells treated with
lapatinib continuously and then no drug for 3 days (Cont-No drug). Three independent experiments were performed with three technical
replicates. (Error = SD; ****p<0.0001).

Pertuzumab slightly reduced cell number (p<0.01)
compared to the DMSO (+ IgG control) only when
lapatinib was withdrawn in SK250LR cells but there was
no statistically significant difference between all other
groups (Fig. 4A), indicating that pertuzumab was not very
effective in SK250LR cells. This is consistent with the
apoptotic assay, which showed that pertuzumab did not
cause any change in the percentage of apoptotic cells with
or without lapatinib in SK250LR cells (Fig. 4C and Suppl.
Fig. 5A to F). In BT250LR cells, withdrawal of lapatinib
resulted in a statistically significant higher number of
cell count compared to those with continuous lapatinib
treatment (p<0.0001, Fig. 4B). Pertuzumab significantly
reduced cell number of BT250LR whether or not lapatinib
was present (both p<0.0001), which is consistent with
the apoptotic assay (Fig 4D, Suppl. Fig. 5G to L). These
experiments showed that lapatinib-resistant cell line
BT250LR was sensitive to pertuzumab with or without
continuous lapatinib treatment, but not SK250LR.

recovered to similar level of untreated BT-474 cells, but
phospho-MAPK was still below the basal level. There was
no difference in the expression levels of EGFR, HER2
and HER3 before and after 7D-lapatinib withdrawal.
The reintroduction of 250 nM lapatinib after 7 days of
withdrawal (7DW-250 nM Lap) caused a decrease in the
cell number of BT250LR cells-7DW compared to DMSO
control (p<0.0001), which was more than those which
were continuously treated with lapatinib (Cont-250 nM
Lap) (Fig. 5D). This indicates that the cells were only
transiently adapted to lapatinib, and removing lapatinib
from BT250LR cell line reverted its resistance resulting
in BT250LR-7DW becoming more sensitive to lapatinib.
By comparing the differences in HER signalling
profile between SK250LR and BT250LR cell lines, it is
suggested that BT250LR cells responded to pertuzumab
treatment because they were still dependent on the HER2
signalling, whilst SK250LR cells had downregulation of
HER2 and decreased pHER2 levels, suggesting a shift of
dependency from HER2 signalling and hence being less
sensitive to pertuzumab.

Lapatinib-resistant SK-BR-3 lost its dependence
on HER2 signalling pathway

Effect of the combination of lapatinib and
pertuzumab in vivo

In previous experiments, the resistant cells were
continuously treated with lapatinib until being seeded
for cell counting experiments. To investigate the reasons
for SK250LR cell line not responding to the combined
anti-HER2-targeted therapy, lapatinib was removed from
the lapatinib-resistant cell lines for 7 days (7D) before
further western blot and cell counting experiments. The
HER signalling profile of these 7D-lapatinib-withdrawn
cells was compared to cells that were continuously treated
with lapatinib and untreated parental cells. In SK250LR
cells, phospho-EGFR, phospho-HER2 and phosphoHER4 did not reactivate after lapatinib was removed for
7 days (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the expression levels of
EGFR and HER2 decreased after 7D-lapatinib withdrawal,
indicating that the cells might have developed permanent
changes in the cell biology, in which they were no longer
dependent on EGFR and HER2 signalling. In fact, the cell
counting experiments revealed that SK250LR cells were
still insensitive to lapatinib even after 7 days of lapatinib
withdrawal (Fig. 5C). HER3 and Akt were slightly
rephosphorylated (Fig 5A). They appeared to correlate
with each other, as Akt is the main downstream effector
of HER3. Phospho-MAPK significantly increased in
SK250LR cells after 7D-lapatinib withdrawal; however,
this change was not correlated to the phosphorylation any
of the HER receptors.
In BT250LR cells, all the HER receptors and
downstream proteins rephosphorylated after lapatinib
was removed for 7 days (Fig. 5B). The levels of phosphoEGFR, phospho-HER2, phospho-HER4 and phospho-Akt
in BT250LR after 7-day withdrawal were even higher
than those in untreated BT-474 cells. Phospho-HER3

The anti-tumour efficacy of the drug combination
was further tested in a BT-474 mouse xenograft model. In
the clinical setting, a lower dose of lapatinib has been used
when combined with trastuzumab (+/− chemotherapy)
due to possible additional toxicity and expected increased
efficacy. For example, in the neoALTTO trial, a 1500 mg
lapatinib dose was used for the lapatinib group but 1000
mg was used when combined with trastuzumab [20]. To
demonstrate the additive effect of the drug combination,
we also used a lower dose of lapatinib, which did not
reduce tumour size in this experiment (Fig 6A). The
results in the pertuzumab treated group varied, with two
tumour regressed but another two progressed. All tumours
in the combination treatment group regressed and this
change was significantly different from the vehicle group
(p<0.05) and the lapatinib group (p<0.01). The above
results suggested that the combination of lapatinib and
pertuzumab outperformed either monotherapy in vivo.
Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to
detect all the HER receptors and their phosphorylated
forms as well as the expression of Ki-67 and cleaved
caspase-3 in the xenografted tumours. The tumours that
received combination treatment expressed significantly
higher levels of HER4 than all other treatment groups (p
<0.05) (Fig. 6C). There was no significant difference in
phospho-HER4 among all treatment groups (not shown);
however, since the combination treatment group had
high HER4 expression, the ratio of pHER4:HER4 in the
combination group was significantly lower than that of
the vehicle control group (p<0.05) (Fig. 6B). Although

trastuzumab has been shown to downregulate HER2
[31], there was no decrease of HER2 level by lapatinib or
pertuzumab or their combination in vivo (Suppl. Fig. 6).
There were also no significant differences in other protein
markers between the different groups (Suppl. Fig. 6).
The results of IHC staining were also compared

with the regression status of the tumours. The regressed
tumours had significantly reduced ratio of pEGFR:EGFR
(p<0.05) (Fig. 6D) and pHER4:HER4 (p<0.001) (Fig. 6E)
compared to the tumours without regression, suggesting
the inhibition on EGFR and HER4 might be the cause of
tumour regression. There was also higher expression of

volume was normalised to the tumour volume on day 0. (B-E) Indicated HER receptors and their phosphorylated forms (shown in the ratio

cancer.
HER4 expression levels were high in the tumours
treated with the combination of lapatinib and pertuzumab,
suggesting HER4 may mediate the effect of the drugs
on tumour regression. HER4 has been implicated in
both favourable and poor prognosis [38], but the cellular
functions of HER4 vary among different isoforms as well
as its localisation [39]. Our lab has previously shown
that HER4 cleavage and nuclear translocation mediates
acquired resistance to trastuzumab; and nuclear HER4 but
not cytoplasmic HER4 is associated with poor outcome
in HER2-positive breast cancer [40]. Therefore, further
analysis of HER4 isoforms as well as its proteolytic
cleavage and localisation may be required to understand
the correlation of HER4 expression and lapatinib-induced
tumour regression. There was no significant difference in
the expression of Ki-67 and cleaved caspase-3 between
the combination group and other different treatment
groups in the BT-474 xenograft experiment, although the
combination group was the most effective in inhibiting
tumour growth. This could be because the analysed
tumours are the residual tumour cells that were either
innately resistant or had developed acquired resistance to
the treatment(s). There is also a possibility that the tumour
regression may not be caused by the difference in growth
rate or apoptosis between the groups. The other potential
mechanisms to consider include vessel growth inhibition,
changes in vessel perfusion and ADCC which could be
induced by pertuzumab [41].
Total cell counting and apoptotic assays showed that
SK250LR cell line was not sensitive to the combination
treatment of lapatinib and pertuzumab. The innate
resistance to pertuzumab may be due to the permanent
change in cell biology such that they are no longer
dependent on EGFR and HER2 signalling. However, the
BT250LR cell line was still dependent on HER2 signalling
and responded to pertuzumab treatment. Our data shows
that the combination of lapatinib and pertuzumab or
pertuzumab alone may be effective in a subset of lapatinibresistant cancers, which could be further confirmed in vivo
by testing in a BT250LR xenograft model.
One limitation of our study was that it was
carried out in only two cell lines, SK-BR-3 and BT474, although the lapatinib-resistant variants of these 2
cell lines were included. These two cell lines appeared
to have different mechanisms of acquired resistance to
lapatinib. Therefore, more acquired lapatinib-resistant
cell lines could be generated from other lapatinibsensitive HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines to
further understand the difference mechanisms of acquired
lapatinib resistance. A recent report showed that antiHER3 monoclonal antibody was synergistic with lapatinib
in PC9ZD, a gefitinib-resistant lung cancer cell line which
harbours the T790M mutation [42]. As we have shown
that the NRG1/HER3 pathway was one of the mechanisms
of acquired lapatinib resistance in HER2-overexpressing

DISCUSSION
NRG1 has been implicated in lapatinib resistance
[27] as well as overcoming the inhibitory effect of
gefitinib [32] and trastuzumab [33] treatment in
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Our study
demonstrated that the NRG1 protein expression levels
increased in response to lapatinib treatment in HER2overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, and lapatinib could
not sustain its inhibition of HER receptor signalling. The
use of SPG1 antibody suggested that HER3 ligands may
contribute to lapatinib resistance. Moreover, we showed
that pertuzumab could enhance response to lapatinib in
BT-474 cells and xenograft models.
A very recent study revealed that high NRG1
expression predicts a decreased recurrence-free survival
in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer patients compared
to patients with low NRG1 expression [27], suggesting
the clinical importance of NRG1. Although their study
aimed to demonstrate the role of NRG1 autocrine
signalling in the acquired lapatinib resistance, they
combined the data of all patients receiving chemotherapy,
tamoxifen or systematically untreated; therefore, this
analysis could not address the association between
NRG1 expression and lapatinib response. To date, there
is only one published clinical trial involving lapatinib
(EGF104911) that measured NRG1 level in tumours by
immunohistochemistry (IHC), but they did not mention
any correlation between NRG1 and clinical benefits
from lapatinib monotherapy [34]. We propose for further
studies to be done to validate NRG1 as a predictive
biomarker for lapatinib sensitivity. Since ADAM10 and
17 have been shown to play a role in mediating acquired
resistance to trastuzumab through the shedding of HER
ligands [33, 35], it may be important to assess the role of
ADAM 10 and 17 proteases as well as other HER ligands
in mediating lapatinib resistance in HER2-positive breast
cancer.
The addition of pertuzumab to lapatinib inhibited
the phosphorylation of HER3 and HER4, suggesting that
HER3 and HER4 still preferentially bind to HER2 even in
the presence of lapatinib. However, the phosphorylation of
downstream MAPK and Akt was not completely inhibited.
This may be caused by the residue kinase activity of the
HER receptors, or the dimerisation of HER3 and HER4
with EGFR or each other. Thus, it may be important to
assess the different dimerisation patterns in relation to
lapatinib treatment and resistance [36]. Since neratinib
could overcome trastuzumab resistance [37] and lapatinib
resistance [27], it will be interesting to assess whether
the combination of pertuzumab and neratinib will also
be additive in vitro and in vivo for HER2-positive breast

breast cancer cell lines, this pathway might also have
a potential role in breast cancer cells that have innate
resistance to lapatinib. Thus, it would be important to
assess the role of HER3 ligands and the effect of HER3
monoclonal antibodies in combination with lapatinib in
a larger panel of lapatinib-sensitive and innate-resistant
breast cancer cell lines.
It may also be important to consider other pathways
which may affect HER receptor signalling and lapatinib
sensitivity. For example, a recent report showed that
neurotensin (NTS) and its high affinity receptor (NTSR1)
enhances EGFR, HER2, and HER3 activation, but
lapatinib could reduce the tumour growth of breast cancer
cells overexpressing NTS and NTSR1 [43]. Therefore,
it could be interesting to further assess the cross-talk
between neurotensinergic and the HER pathways in
relation to lapatinib sensitivity and resistance. It may also
be useful to use a high-throughput combinatorial drug
screening approach to identify compensatory pathways
that mediate lapatinib resistance and to target them with
other targeted agents in combination with lapatinib to
overcome its resistance and to achieve durable clinical in
order benefit [44].
Although lapatinib plus pertuzumab may be a
useful combination strategy for anti-HER2 therapy, it
will require further comparison with trastuzumab plus
pertuzumab or trastuzumab plus lapatinib or the triple
combination in preclinical models and in future human
patient trials. Furthermore, since this study was initiated,
the roadmap for anti-HER2 treatments has changed. For
metastatic breast cancer, the combination of pertuzumab
and trastuzumab with docetaxel chemotherapy is now
recommended as the first-line treatment. T-DM1 is
increasingly used as the second-line anti-HER2 treatment
since EMILIA trial showed that T-DM1 was superior to
lapatinib plus capecitabine in prolonging progression-free
and overall survivals, and it caused less toxicity in HER2positive breast cancer patients previously treated with
trastuzumab and a taxane [45]. This means that lapatinib
with capecitabine is increasingly being used as a thirdline anti-HER2 treatment for metastatic breast cancer.
Although we showed that pertuzumab and lapatinib could
potentially be useful in the setting of lapatinib resistance,
this is uncertain in the context of patients who have
previously failed three lines of anti-HER2 treatments,
namely pertuzumab and trastuzumab with docetaxel
followed by T-DM1 and lapatinib with capecitabine. This
will needs to be tested in preclinical models first. However,
the combination may still be potentially useful for patients
who have started on lapatinib containing regimen first and
have not had pertuzumab.
In summary, we have found that lapatinib could
not sustain the inhibition of HER receptor signalling.
This is correlated with an increased upregulation of
NRG1 expression in HER2-overexpressing cells. Both
the parental and lapatinib-resistant SK-BR-3 and BT-474
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells were sensitive to SGP1, which inhibits the binding
of NRG1 and other HER3 ligands. The exogenous NRG1
stimulation diminished the inhibitory effect of lapatinib in
HER2-overexpressing cells. The addition of pertuzumab
to lapatinib inhibited NRG1-stimulated HER3 and HER4
signalling in both SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells, although the
additive effect was only seen in the parental and resistant
BT-474 cells as well as BT-474 xenograft models. This
novel combination treatment may provide a promising
strategy in clinical HER2-targeted therapy and may inhibit
a subset of lapatinib-resistant breast cancer, although the
group of patients that will respond to this therapy requires
further stratification.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
Human breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3 and
BT-474 were obtained from cell services at Cancer
Research UK (Lincoln’s Inn Fields laboratory), which
has a stringent quality control in cell authenticity and has
incorporated short-tandem repeat (STR) profiling for cell
line validation. Lapatinib-resistant cell lines SK250LR
and BT250LR were generated by chronic exposure of
increasing concentration of lapatinib from 25 nM, 50
nM, 100 nM to 250 nM for 10 months, then the cells
were maintained in 250 nM lapatinib. Fresh lapatinib
was replaced every 3 days. Lapatinib was purchased from
Selleck Chemicals. Pertuzumab was generously provided
by Roche. SGP1 antibody was obtained from Cancer
Research Technology.
Recombinant NRG1 was obtained from SigmaAldrich. Human non-specific IgG control was purchased
from R&D Systems.

SDS-PAGE and Western blotting
The procedures of SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting have been previously described [33, 35]. Primary
antibodies to EGFR (1:5000), phospho-HER2 (Y1221/22)
(1:1000), HER2 (1:10000), phospho-HER3 (Y1289)
(1:1000), HER3 (1:10000), phospho-Akt1/2 (S473)
(1:1000), Akt1/2 (1:5000), phospho-p42/44-MAPK
(T202/Y204) (1:1000), p42/44-MAPK (1:5000) and
β-actin (1:2500) were from Cell Signalling Technology.
Antibodies recognising phospho-EGFR (Y1173) (1:1000)
and phospho-HER4 (Y1056) (1:1000) were obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-HER3 (1:10000) antibody
was purchased from Abcam. HRP-conjugated antirabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:10000) was purchased
from Life Technologies. After antibody incubation, the

the indicated agents. Cell proliferation was monitored
by IncuCyte Kinetic Live Cell Imaging System (Essen
BioScience). High quality phase-contrast images of 16
fields in each well were taken in 6-hour interval for 4
days (SK-BR-3 and SK250LR) or 7 days (BT-474 and
BT250LR). Culture medium and drugs were replaced on
day 2 and day 5. The metric of monolayer confluence was
measured by IncuCyte software package Confluence v1.5
and used as a surrogate for cell number. The growth rate
of cells was calculated by plotting the log of confluence
against time. The percentage growth rate is calculated with
respect to DMSO control.

ELISA detection of NRG1 was performed using the
Human NRG1-β1/HRG1-β1 DuoSet kit (R&D Systems)
and the procedures were done according to manufacturer’s
protocol. A six-point standard curve was produced using
a 2-fold serial dilution of a standard of 4000 pg/ml NRG1
and plotted using a fourth order polynomial function in
GraphPad Prism 6. The concentration of NRG1 in each
sample was calculated using the standard curve and
normalised with the protein concentration as a surrogate
for cell number.

Cell proliferation assay

RNA silencing

Approximately 10,000 cells per well (for SK-BR-3
and SK250LR) or 20,000 cells per well (for BT-474 and
BT250LR) were seeded in triplicate on 24-well tissue
culture plates, allowed to adhere and enter log phrase
overnight. Each triplicate was treated with the indicated
agents for 3 days. Culture medium was discarded. Cells
were washed with PBSA twice and then detached from
the well with 500 μl of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution.
Trypsinised cells were diluted using Coulter Isoton II
diluent and counted using a Coulter Z2 particle counter
(Beckman Coulter); only the cell population with the size
of 13–27 μm was counted.

project license of Dr. Ji-Liang Li (PPL 30/2771) as per
previous xenograft experiment [46]. At the age of 5–6
weeks, approximately 5×106 BT-474 cells in 1:1 matrigel/
RPMI 1640 medium were injected subcutaneously
into the mammary fat pad of the mice under general
anaesthesia induced by isoflurane. The diet of the mice
was supplement by 5ug/ml β-estradiol and 0.04% (v/v)
Baytril in drinking water from 2 days before tumour cell
implantation until the end of experiment. The xenograft
tumour size was monitored twice a week before treatment.
When the tumour size of more than 40% of mice reached
100–150 mm3 (length×width×height×0.52), the mice
were randomised into 4 treatment groups: a) TWEEN80
(control for lapatinib) and PBSA (control for pertuzumab),
b) lapatinib and PBSA, c) TWEEN80 and pertuzumab, d)
lapatinib and pertuzumab, and they received treatment for
3 weeks. Lapatinib was administered 5 times per week at
50 mg/kg body weight, half of the standard dose [47, 48],
by oral gavage. Pertuzumab was administered once per
week at 12mg/kg body weight for the first week and 6mg/
kg body weight afterwards by intraperitoneal injection [49,
50]. The mice were sacrified when the geometric mean
diameter ([length + width]÷2) of the tumour exceeded 15
mm or animal welfare was compromised. The mice were
euthanised by cardiac puncture under isoflurane general
anaesthesia and death confirmed by neck dislocation.
Residual tumours were removed and were immediately
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 48 hours and
stored in 70% ethanol at 4°C until being processed at the
Oxford Centre for Histopathology Research. Paraffinembedded tumours were sectioned into 4 µm slides.

the manufacturer’s protocol and applied to the slides for
1 to 10 minutes (depending on the antibody used), then
washed with tap water. Haematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich)
counterstain was applied to the tissue sections for 30
seconds and then washed with tap water. Finally, the tissue
sections were mounted with Aquatex agent (VWR).
Primary antibodies for EGFR (1:50), phosphoHER2 (Y1221/22) (1:320), HER2 (1:400) and phosphoHER3 (1:1600) were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology. Phospho-EGFR antibody (1:50) was obtained
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. HER3 antibody (1:1000)
was obtained from Abcam. Phospho-HER4 antibody
(1:100) was obtained from Novus Biologicals. HER4
antibody (1:200) was obtained from Thermo Scientific.
Scoring of IHC staining was performed independently by
two authors, WL and IR, based on the intensity of staining
and the percentage of cells stained with a particular
intensity. The score of each intensity band was calculated
by multiplying the intensity score with the percentage
of cells in such intensity (e.g. if 20% of cells have 3+
intensity, the score of would be 60). The total score of
a sample is the sum of the scores of individual intensity
bands; for example, a tumour sample, which has 60% of
tumour cell with strong (3+) intensity, 20% of cells with
moderate (2+) intensity and 20% of cells with weak (1+)
intensity, has a total score of 3×60 + 2×20 + 1×20 = 240.
The maximum score of a sample is 300 and the minimum
is 0.

Immunohistochemistry staining

Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad
Prism 6. For experiments involving multiple treatment
groups and technical replicates (e.g. total cell counting
and ELISA), the data were analysed using matched
two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc correction.
For experiments involving multiple treatments without
technical replicates (e.g. western blot densitometry and
FACS), the data were analysed using matched one-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc correction. To compare
dose-dependent effect on different groups (e.g. lapatinibsensitive and -resistant cell lines), the parameters of the
best-fit line/curve were compared using extra sum-of
-squares F test. Comparison of two groups (regression vs.
non-regression) was performed using unpaired t-test.

Statistical analysis

The tissue sections were incubated at 60°C for
10 minutes and then were immediately washed twice in
histo-clear solution (National Diagnostics) for 5 minutes
each. Then they were rehydrated twice with 100% ethanol
for another 5 minutes each, followed by 70% ethanol
for 5 minutes and finally tap water for 5 minutes. The
rehydrated tissue sections were put in a vessel containing
1× Target retrieval solution (Dako) or EDTA pH8.0 buffer
(according to antibody manufacturer’s protocol). The
vessel was heated to 125°C for 2 minutes in a pressure
cooker. Once the cooker de-pressurised, the tissue sections
were rinsed in water and kept in PBS until blocking. The
samples were blocked with normal horse serum (available
from ImmPRESS kit, Vector Laboratories) at RT for 30
minutes. Primary antibodies diluted in normal horse serum
were applied to the slides and incubated at 4°C overnight.
The tissue sections were washed in PBS for 5 minutes.
Mouse or rabbit secondary antibodies (available from
ImmPRESS kit, Vector Laboratories) were applied and
incubated at RT for 30 minutes. The tissue sections were
washed in PBS for 5 minutes. ImmPACT DAB peroxidase
substrate (Vector Laboratories) was diluted according to
