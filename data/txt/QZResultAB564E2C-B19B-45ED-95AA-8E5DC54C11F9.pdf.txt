Abstract
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are now the mainstay of treatment in many types
of cancer. However, their benefit is frequently short-lived, mandating the search for safe
potentiation strategies. Cycles of fasting enhance the activity of chemo-radiotherapy in preclinical
cancer models and dietary approaches based on fasting are currently explored in clinical trials.
Whether combining fasting with TKIs is going to be potentially beneficial remains unknown.
Here we report that starvation conditions increase the ability of commonly administered TKIs,
including erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, crizotinib and regorafenib, to block cancer cell growth,
to inhibit the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and to strengthen
E2F-dependent transcription inhibition. In cancer xenografts models, both TKIs and cycles of
fasting slowed tumor growth, but, when combined, these interventions were significantly more
effective than either type of treatment alone. In conclusion, cycles of fasting or of specifically
designed fasting-mimicking diets should be evaluated in clinical studies as a means to potentiate
the activity of TKIs in clinical use.

Introduction

(ALK) TKIs are successfully employed in NSCLC with
translocated ALK [2]. HER2 TKIs, such as lapatinib,
are used in breast cancer with amplified HER2 [3] while
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR)
TKIs and multitarget TKIs are commonly employed in
renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, thyroid
cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and in
previously treated colorectal cancer [4-7]. In sensitive
tumors, disease remissions can frequently be achieved
with these agents. However, patients will sooner or later
face relapses due to the emergence of resistant cancer cell
clones and eventually succumb to their disease [2-4, 8].
Thus, there remains a critical need for strategies to safely
increase the effectiveness of TKIs [8].
Recent discoveries indicate that an important

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are now the
mainstay of treatment in several types of cancer. By
interfering with the tyrosine kinase activity of mutated
or overexpressed oncogenes, such as Epidermal Growth
Factor Receptor (EGFR) or Human Epidermal Growth
Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), or by simultaneously blocking
multiple signaling pathways that are relevant to cancer
(or to cancer angiogenesis), these drugs target biological
functions that cancer cells are critically reliant on,
ultimately causing cancer cell death and tumor shrinkage
[1]. EGFR TKIs have a proven superiority over standard
chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
with mutated EGFR and Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase

Achilles’ heel of many types of cancer cells is their
inability to adapt to starvation [9, 10]. While healthy
cells respond to nutrient and growth factor deprivation by
activating maintenance and stress response mechanisms
that make them more resistant to different types of insults,
including chemotherapy, this type of response is frequently
compromised in cancer cells, primarily as a consequence
of aberrant oncogene activation [9, 10]. Instead of
reducing the activity of growth promoting signalling
pathways and protein synthesis, starved cancer cells
may boost both processes, ultimately facing metabolic
imbalance and becoming prone to oxidative stress, caspase
activation, DNA damage, and apoptosis [9]. In pre-clinical
models, cycles of fasting were found to be per se sufficient
to slow tumor growth, matching in some cases the efficacy
of chemotherapy, and to synergize with chemotherapeutics
and radiotherapy when applied in combination with them
[9, 11, 12]. Another possible advantage of administering
chemotherapy during fasting is that its overall tolerability
appears to be increased, potentially allowing to administer
higher doses of chemotherapeutics without severe toxicity
[10, 13, 14].
Several clinical trials are currently studying
the effects of fasting or of fasting-mimicking diets in
patients undergoing chemotherapy (NCT01304251,
NCT01175837,
NCT00936364,
NCT01175837,
NCT01802346, NCT02126449). Preliminary clinical
observations indicated that this type of dietary
interventions are feasible and can be safely introduced
[14]. In 2009, Safdie and colleagues reported on a series of
ten patients diagnosed with a variety of malignancies who
voluntarily fasted prior to (48-140 h) and/or following (556 h) chemotherapy (an average of 4 cycles of various
chemotherapy drugs in combination with fasting) [14].
More recently, evidence of potential beneficial effects
of fasting in patients receiving chemotherapy in terms of
reduced risk of leukopenia has been reported [13]. In the
light of these results, further evaluations of the potential of
these approaches, both at the preclinical and at the clinical
level, are warranted [15, 16].
The purpose of this preclinical study was to
determine whether administering TKIs during fasting
would increase their efficacy and to investigate the
mechanisms underlying these effects.

FBS) would potentiate the growth-inhibiting activity of
TKIs in current clinical use, including the EGFR TKIs
erlotinib (Tarceva) and gefitinib (Iressa), the ALK TKIs
crizotinib (Xalkori) and TAE684, the HER2/EGFR TKIs
lapatinib (Tykerb) and CP724714, and the multitarget TKI
regorafenib (Stivarga) (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure
1). These compounds were tested in appropriate cellular
models, which included the NSCLC cells with mutated
EGFR, HCC827, the NSCLC cells carrying the EML4ALK translocation, H3122, the breast cancer cells with
amplified HER2, BT474 and SKBR3, and the regorafenibsensitive colorectal cancer cells HCT116, by measuring
viability with the MTS-based assay CellTiter96 Aqueous
1. After a four-day treatment, starvation conditions were
sufficient to slow cancer cell growth in SKBR3, BT474,
and HCT116 cells (Figure 1D-F), but not in HCC827
and H3122 cells (Figure 1A-C), although extending the
starvation period from four to six days visibly affected
cell growth in the latter two cell lines, too (Figure 1G,
H). In all of the cellular models, a synergistic potentiation
of the TKI activity by starvation was readily evident
and was documented by the calculation of CIs (Figure
1A-I, Supplementary Figure 1A, B). Measuring cell
viability with an alternative assay, the sulforhodamine B
colorimetric assay [17], yielded similar results and readily
revealed a cooperation between starvation conditions and
TKIs, too (data not shown).
Notably, the potentiation of TKI activity was
apparently not at the cost of a loss in specificity, since
starved breast cancer cells without HER2 amplification
(MDA-MB-231 cells) were still insensitive to lapatinib
and NSCLC without mutated EGFR or translocated
ALK (A549 cells) remained insensitive to erlotinib and
crizotinib despite starvation (Supplementary Figure 1C-E).

Evidence for a key role of MAPK signaling
inhibition in the potentiation of TKI activity by
starvation
In cancer cells with mutated receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) or oncogenes with kinase activity,
growth is typically driven by the constitutive activation
of downstream signaling cascades, such as the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [18]. Inhibition
of these pathways by TKIs is typically rapid, but frequently
short-lived, given the activation of compensatory
feedback mechanisms which limit the efficacy of the
TKIs themselves [19]. We monitored the phosphorylation
status of ERK as a reading frame for the activity of the
MAPK signaling cascade in cells treated with TKIs
with or without starvation. Experiments performed with
crizotinib and lapatinib demonstrated a striking reduction
of phospho-ERK after a 1-h treatment [Figure 2A and
[20]]. However, prolonged exposure to the TKI would
typically result in a recovery in ERK phosphorylation,

which returned to baseline levels, or even topped them, by
24 h of exposure in all of the cell lines tested (Figure 2AB). Starvation caused a reduction in ERK phosphorylation
in some cell line (BT474, SKBR3, and HCT116), but not
in H3122 and HCC827. However, in every instance, the
combination of starvation plus TKI was the most effective
at maintaining ERK phosphorylation inhibition in cancer

cells (Figure 2A-B). Therefore, these findings are in line
with those from the viability assays and suggest that the
cooperation between TKIs and starvation conditions may
rely on the ability of the latter to prevent compensatory or
alternative mechanisms that can bypass signaling cascade
inhibition by TKIs.
We subsequently, reasoned that, if this were the

case, a constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling
pathway would prohibit or, at least, reduce, the observed
potentiation of TKI activity by starvation. Thus, we
engineered HCC827, HCT116, and H3122 cells to
overexpress either a wild type HRAS allele or HRAS
V12 (Figure 3A-C) and treated these cells with gefitinib,
regorafenib, or crizotinib with or without starvation,
respectively. As shown for H3122 cells, expressing
HRAS or HRAS V12 indeed led to higher levels of
phosphorylated ERK in response to crizotinib alone or to
crizotinib coupled to starvation conditions (Figure 3D).
Interestingly, we found that the expression HRAS alleles
sensitized two out of three cancer cell lines (H3122 and
HCC827) to starvation, while HCT116 cells were not
sensitized, possibly because this cell line already harbors a
mutated KRAS, which may make these cells less affected
by the genetic manipulation that we performed (Figure
3E-G). However, in all of the cell lines, both HRAS and
HRAS V12 blunted the anti-proliferative activity of the
TKIs, both alone and in combination with starvation,
indicating that inhibition of the MAPK pathway indeed
plays a key role in mediating the antitumor effects of TKIs
in both conditions (Figure 3E-G).

To gain further insights into the mechanisms
underlying the potentiation of TKI activity by starvation
we chose H3122 cells and compared the effects of
crizotinib, starvation and their combination in terms
of global gene expression as detected by standard gene
expression microarrays. Six different comparisons were
performed (starvation vs. control, crizotinib vs. control,
starvation vs. crizotinib, crizotinib plus starvation
vs. control, crizotinib plus starvation vs. starvation,
and crizotinib plus starvation vs. crizotinib) and the
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were quantified
as summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Here, it is
noteworthy that, while all of the treatments (or their
combinations) changed gene expression (vs. control cells)
by over a thousand genes (2,308 DEGs for starvation;
1,305 DEGs for crizotinib; 2,676 DEGs for crizotinib plus
starvation) comparing starvation vs. crizotinib yielded a
much lower number of DEGs (568), suggesting that the
two types of treatment have similar biological effects in
cancer cells. In line with this notion, according to a GO
analysis, cells treated with crizotinib and starved cells
shared most of the top, common GO categories (Table 1
and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3) while only two GO
categories appeared to be unique of starved cells and of

cells exposed to crizotinib. Specifically, it emerged that, in
starved cells, down-regulated DEGs clustered in categories
related to cell cycle control and DNA damage response
(Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2), while up-regulated
DEGs were only loosely convergent in categories
related to endoplasmic reticulum functionalities. The
same analysis conducted in crizotinib-treated cells gave
similar results, being the top categories of down-regulated
DEGs the same as in the previous analysis (Table 1 and
Supplementary Table 2), while, again, up-regulated DEGs
were not convergent in any ontological category. Notably,
when considering only the down-regulated DEGs that
were present in the top four affected canonical pathways,
the overlap between starvation and crizotinib was almost
complete, with 48 out of 53 genes represented in the top
three pathways modulated by starvation (vs. control)
being also present in the top four pathways modulated by
crizotinib (vs. control) (Supplementary Table 3). Therefore
these analyses indicated that starvation and treatment with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

crizotinib share core transcriptional effects.
In order to determine what starvation would add
to the TKI in terms of gene expression regulation, we
compared the arrays corresponding to crizotinib alone to
those corresponding to crizotinib plus starvation. Also in
this case, the number of DEGs (264) was found to be very
limited, which is in line with the notion that both types
of treatment likely act on the same genetic and molecular
mechanisms. We reasoned that these 264 DEGs could
represent a core of genes that may explain the stronger
anti-proliferative effect exerted by combined crizotinib
and starvation compared to crizotinib alone. Using
functional enrichment we observed that the DEGs of cells
treated with crizotinib and starvation clustered in canonical
pathways within the area of cell cycle control and DNA
damage (Supplementary Table 4). Among these genes,
it is worth to notice the presence of important cancer
genes such as E2F1, E2F2, and RAD51, which combined
starvation and crizotinib down-regulated to a higher extent

compared to these treatments alone (Supplementary Table
4). Notably, the effect of crizotinib, starvation and their
combination on E2F1, E2F2, and RAD51 could be readily
verified by QPCR (Figure 4A).
In the attempt to identify upstream regulators that
could be responsible of the en masse gene co-regulation
exerted by crizotinib plus starvation (vs. crizotinib alone),
the family group of E2f factors (E2F1-6) was found as the
most likely key proteins causing the observed changes in
gene expression (Figure 4B and Supplementary Table 5).
This prediction is based on the fact that many of the genes
known to be experimentally modified by these proteins
and transcription factors were overrepresented in our
gene lists in a statistically significant fashion. Specifically,

according to this type of analysis, gene expression
modulation by combined crizotinib and starvation (vs.
crizotinib) could be attributed to the activation of E2F6,
a dominant negative inhibitor of other E2F family
members [21], and of RB1, and to inhibition of the cell
cycle promoting factors E2F1 and E2F4 [22]. Consistent
with these findings, a reduction in phosphorylated
RB that was more pronounced in cells treated with the
combination crizotinib plus starvation as compared to
crizotinib or starvation alone could be detected in H3122
by immunoblotting (Figure 4C). Finally, in cell cycle
experiments, we found that, while crizotinib, starvation,
and their combination all caused an accumulation of
cells in the G1/0 phase of the cell cycle, the reduction

in the cells proceeding to S and G2/M phase was more
pronounced when the two treatments were given together.
Moreover, combining crizotinib with starvation increased
the rate of hypodiploid cell nuclei, which is consistent with
an increase in cell death (Figure 4D, E). Therefore, taken
together, these findings are consistent with the observation
that inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway by TKIs is
made stronger and more durable by starvation (Figure 2)
and that such inhibition plays a key role in the activity of
combined TKI plus starvation (Figure 3).

with no difference in terms of efficacy between the two
approaches (Figure 5 A, B). However, the combination
TKI+fasting was more effective than either type of
treatment alone (Figure 5A, B). Notably, as observed in
vitro, the combination of fasting with crizotinib was the
only intervention to result in a significant reduction in
phospho-ERK levels, whereas fasting alone was found
to increase phospho-ERK in vivo, too (Figure 5C).
Notably, although fasted mice did exhibit transient weight
losses, they fully recovered their weight between one
cycle and the next one (Figure 5D). Similar results were
obtained with regorafenib in xenografts of the colorectal
cancer cell line, HCT116 (Figure 6). After a three-week
treatment, both regorafenib and cycles of fasting achieved
a substantial reduction in tumor growth compared to the
controls (Figure 6A, B). However, again, combined fasting
and regorafenib were significantly more active than either
type of treatment alone. Finally, also in this animal model,

Fasting potentiates TKI activity in vivo
Based on these premises, we sought for the proof-ofconcept that starvation would increase the efficacy of TKIs
also in vivo, using, to this end, well-established xenografts
cancer models. In H3122 xenografts, both cycles of
fasting and crizotinib effectively reduced tumor growth

specifically designed fasting-mimicking dietary regimens
in combination with TKIs in oncology, which could
replace much more toxic and less effective chemotherapy
treatments.
Notably, compared to standard chemotherapy, TKIs
typically have a lower toxicity and their administration
rarely leads to gastrointestinal side effects with
consequently reduced food intake and weight loss [1-4].
Thus, patients that are on chronic treatment with TKIs
appear to be particularly well-suited for undergoing
cycles of fasting (or of fasting-mimicking diets). In
addition, because fasting was shown in earlier studies
to promote cell cycle inhibition and to activate powerful
self-protection mechanisms in normal cells [10], its use in

Discussion
In this study, we show for the first time that TKIs
that are commonly administered for treating solid tumors
become potentiated in their activity by starvation. We
also demonstrate that starvation increases the efficacy
with which TKI block cell signaling via the MAPK
cascade and consequently affect gene expression. These
results are of special relevance since they suggest
possible new applications for short-term fasting or for

combination with TKIs has the potential to reduce even
further the toxicity of these inhibitors while broadening
their range of activity. Therefore, coupling cycles of
starvation with TKIs may be more feasible in a clinical
context and allow a much better control of the disease.
The mechanism underlying the synergy between
starvation, on the one hand, and TKIs, on the other,
appears to be, at least in part, an inhibition of the signaling
cascades controlled by aberrantly activated oncogenes (i.e.
MAPK signaling), which is much more pronounced when
the two interventions are combined than when they are
administered separately. In line with this notion are the
results of our microarray studies, which showed a strong
overlap between the effects of starvation and crizotinib
in terms of changes induced in the gene expression
profile, and a synergy between the two interventions
for the inhibition of E2F transcription factor-controlled
transcription [22]. Formally, the demonstration of a key
role for the inhibition of MAPK signaling in the activity of
TKIs and of TKIs combined with starvation was obtained
in cell lines engineered with wild type or oncogenic
HRAS, since both HRAS alleles were able to partially
reverse the effect of the TKI (alone and in combination
with starvation) on cancer cell viability. Notably, it is
possible that other mechanisms in addition to MAPK
signaling inhibition also contribute to the synergistic
potentiation of TKI activity by starvation, both in vitro
and in vivo. Addressing this possibility may increase
our understanding of this effect and also allow a better
selection of the patients who are going to benefit the most
from this combination.
Incidentally, of interest was also the observation
that, in H3122 and HCC827 cells overexpressing HRAS
alleles, starvation alone inhibited cell growth to a higher

extent as compared to control cells. These findings suggest
that, even if resistant to TKIs (administered in combination
with starvation or not), cancer cell clones overexpressing
HRAS are likely to be strongly affected by fasting (or
fasting-mimicking diets), which could potentially avoid
the expansion of TKI-resistant, HRAS overexpressing
cells [20] or, at least, delay such an occurrence.
Dietary interventions that are less drastic than
fasting, such as calorie restriction or protein restriction
have previously been reported to achieve some of the
benefits of fasting itself, namely, a partial protection from
the toxicity of chemotherapy [23]. Whether they are also
sufficient to achieve anticancer effects on established
tumors or to potentiate the activity of anticancer agents
is debated [23-26]. Addressing the effects of calorie or
protein restricted regimens in combination with TKIs is
going to be of extreme importance in the definition of the
optimal diet that, when combined with these agents, will
maximize their effectiveness [27].
In conclusion, our study shows that administering
TKIs under starvation conditions achieves optimal
anticancer effects by providing a full and durable inhibition
of the MAPK cascade and, consequently, of E2F-mediated
transcription. This work highlights a possible new
application for fasting (or for specifically designed fastingmimicking diets) in oncology in combination with TKIs
which has the potential to reduce toxicity to the host while
enhancing the efficacy of the therapy. Further validation
of these preclinical observations in clinical studies should
be considered.

Methods

Cell cycle analysis
For cell cycle analysis, adhering cells were
resuspended in a buffer containing 0.1% Na citrate, 0.1%
Triton-X, and 50 µg/ml propodium iodide. Thereafter, the
isolated cell nuclei were analyzed by flow cytometry using
a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson, Milan, Italy).

Cell lines and reagents
SKBR3, BT474, HCT116, HCC827 and Phoenix
cells were purchased from ATCC (LGC Standards
S.r.l., Milan, Italy). H3122 cells were a kind gift of
Dr. Sacha Rothschild (University Hospital of Basel,
Switzerland). Cells were passaged for less than 6 months
before resuscitation for this study. These cell lines were
authenticated at ATCC by analysis of eight short tandem
repeat loci (CSF1PO, D13S317, D16S539, D5S818,
D7S820, TH01, TPOX, and vWA) and of the Amelogenin
gene (see the provider’s web page). Cells were maintained
in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS,
penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml)
(LifeTechnologies, Italy). Regorafenib, crizotinib, erlotinib
and gefitinib were purchased from Selleck Chemicals
while lapatinib was a kind gift of GlaxoSmithKline.
Puromycin and the protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
were purchased from Sigma Aldrich S.r.l. (Milan, Italy).

Retroviral transduction
pBABE-puro (PBP), PBP-HAS and PBP-HRAS
V12 were purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA,
USA). For retroviral transduction, 1 × 106 Phoenix cells
were plated in 60 mm Petri dishes and allowed to adhere
for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were transfected with 4 μg
plasmid DNA using TransIT-293 (Mirus Bio, Madison,
WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Viral
supernatants were harvested after 36, 48, 60 and 72h and
used to infect H3122 cells (3 × 105), HCT116 (2.5 × 105)
cells and HCC827 cells (3.5 × 105) in 100 mm Petri dishes
in the presence of 5 μg/ml protamine sulfate. Successfully
infected cells were selected using 1 μg/ml puromycin.

Viability assay

Immunoblotting

4x103 BT474, 3x103 SKBR3, 1.7x103 H3122,
1.5x103 HCT116 or 2.5x103 HCC827 cells/well were
plated in 96 well plates in regular medium containing 10%
FBS. 24 h later, the cell medium was removed, cells were
washed twice with PBS and then incubated either in the
same medium or in starvation medium (1% FBS, 0.5 g/l
glucose and antibiotics). 24 h later cells were stimulated
(or not) with lapatinib, CP724714, crizotinib, regorafenib,
gefitinib, or erlotinib. Viability was determined 72 h later
by CellTiter96 Aqueous1 (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

For protein lysate generation from cultured
cells, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then
manually scraped in the presence of 50-200 μl lysis
buffer (25mM Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8; 2mM DTT; 2mM
1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N´,N´-tetraacetic acid; 10%
glycerol; 1% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were incubated
on ice for 15 min with 10 sec vortex shaking every five
min. Finally, lysates were spun at 10.000 g for 2 min
at 4°C. Supernatants were recovered and either used
immediately or stored for subsequent use. Protein lysates
from primary tumors were obtained by mechanically
homogenizing the tumors using a mortar and a pestle
in cold PBS supplemented with anti-protease and antiphosphatase cocktails. After homogenization samples
were washed twice in cold PBS and the pellets were
used for lysate preparation. Protein concentration was
determined according to standard Bradford assay. Proteins
(35 µg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a
PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore S.p.A.,
Vimodrone, Italy), and detected with the following
antibodish: anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) (#4058, Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-AKT
(#9272, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-p44/42
MAPK (ERK1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) (#4377, Cell
Signaling Technology), anti-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2)
(#9102, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-Rb
(Ser807/811) (#9308, Cell Signaling Technology), antiRb (#9309, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-HRAS
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz

Sulforodhamine B staining
4x105 BT474, 3x105 SKBR3, 1x105 H3122, 5x104
HCT116, or 2 x105 HCC827 cells were plated in 60 mm
Petri dishes in regular medium. 24 h later, the cell medium
was removed, cells were washed twice with PBS and
were incubated either in regular medium or in starvation
medium. 24 h later cells were treated or not with lapatinib,
crizotinib, regorafenib, gefitinib, or erlotinib. 5 days later,
cell medium was removed and cells were cultured for two
additional days in regular culture medium. Thereafter,
the culture plates were fixed with cold 3% trichloroacetic
acid at 4°C for 30 minutes, washed with cold water and
dried overnight. Finally, the plates were stained with 0.4%
sulforodhamine B (SRB) in 1% acetic acid, washed four
times with 1% acetic acid to remove unbound dye, dried
overnight and photographed.

Quantity One SW software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc)
using standard ECL.

to the manufacturer’s instructions. 1 µg RNA was
reverse transcribed in a final volume of 50 µl using
High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Life
Technologies, Monza, Italy). 5 µl of the resulting
cDNA were used for qPCR with a 7900 HT Fast RealTime PCR (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies,
Monza, Italy). Primer sequences were as follows: E2F1:
FW 5′- ATGTTTTCCTGTGCCCTGAG -3′; REV
5′- ATCTGTGGTGAGGGATGAGG -3′; E2F2: FW
5′- CTCTCTGAGCTTCAAGCACCTG -3′; REV 5′CTTGACGGCAATCACTGTCTGC -3′; RAD51: FW
5′- TCTCTGGCAGTGATGTCCTGGA -3′; REV 5′TAAAGGGCGGTGGCACTGTCTA -3′. mRNA levels
were detected using SYBR Green GoTaq® qPCR Master
Mix (Promega Italia S.r.l., Milan, Italy) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression was normalized
to housekeeping gene expression (β-Actin). Comparisons
in gene expression were calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method.

Gene expression microarray and functional
analyses
For total RNA isolation, cells were lysed in RLT
buffer and RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Mini Kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Quiagen,
GmbH Hilden, Germany). RNAs were hybridized in
quadruplicate on Agilent Human GE 4x44K V2 Microarray
(G2519F-026652) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Hybridized microarray slides were scanned with the
Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner G2505C at a 5 μm
resolution with the manufacturer’s software (Agilent
ScanControl 8.1.3). The scanned TIFF images were
analyzed numerically and background-corrected using the
Agilent Feature Extraction Software (version 10.7.7.1),
according to the Agilent GE1_107_Sep09 standard
protocol. The output of Feature Extraction was analyzed
with the R software environment for statistical computing
(http://www.r-project.org/) and the Bioconductor library
of biostatistical packages (http://www.bioconductor.org/).
Low signal Agilent probes, identified by a repeated “not
detected” flag across the majority of the arrays in every
condition, were filtered out from the analysis. Signal
intensities across arrays were normalized with the quantile
normalization algorithm. DEGs were determined adopting
a double threshold based on 1) the magnitude of the change
(log2 fold change >1 and <-1 for induced and repressed
genes, respectively); 2) the statistical significance of the
change, measured with a moderated t-test (p-value <0.05)
implemented in the Bioconductor Limma package. The
DAVID resource was used for enrichment analysis of
the DEGs lists, using annotations from Gene Ontology
(http://www.thegeneontology.org), KEGG (http://www.
genome.jp/kegg/), and PFAM (http://pfam.sanger.
ac.uk/). The significance of gene lists over-representation
was determined using a p-value threshold of 0.05. The
Ingenuity Pathway Analyses (IPA) resource was also used
for enrichment analysis of the transcriptome DEGs lists.
The IPA Ontologies are derived from manually curated
collections of experimental data and are utilized to infer
functional enrichment of different type of relationships.
The significance of gene list over-representations was
determined using a Fisher exact p-value threshold of
0.05. All microarray data are available through the Gene
Expression Omnibus database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/) using the accession number GSE62663.

Animal experiments
All mouse experiments were performed in
accordance with the relevant laws and institutional
guidelines for animal care and use following approval by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Advanced Biotechnology Center (Genoa, Italy; protocol
#355). Six to eight week old female BALB/c athymic
(nu+/nu+, n=24) mice were acquired from Charles Rivers
Laboratories (Paris, France). Mice were housed in airfiltered laminar flow cabinets with a 12 -hour light cycle
and food and water ad libitum. Mice were acclimatized
for 2 weeks. 5 x 106 H3122 cells or 2 x 106 HCT116 cells
were injected subcutaneously. Treatment was initiated
when the tumors appeared as established palpable masses
(~2 weeks after the injection). In each experiment, mice
were randomly assigned to one of four arms (with 6-8
mice per treatment arm): control - normal diet; TKI
-normal diet with 3 cycles of TKI (25 mg/kg/day crizotinib
in 0.5% hydroxypropylmethycellulose, 0.1 % Tween 80;
or 7 mg/kg/day regorafenib 30% 1,2 Propylenglykol, 30%
PEG400, 10% Kolliphor 188, via oral gavage for 5 days
a week, Mon-Fri); fasting [water only, for 48h (Sun-Tue)
for three cycles at 1-week intervals]; fasting+TKI. Body
weight and tumor volume were recorded daily. Tumor
volume was calculated using the formula: tumor volume=
(w2 × W) x π/6, where “w” and “W” are “minor side” and
“major side” (in mm), respectively. Mice were sacrificed
after three weeks of treatment. Tumor masses were
isolated, weighted, and used for protein lysate preparation
and subsequent immunoblotting experiments.

5 (GraphPad Software) using one-way ANOVA for
multiple-group comparison or unpaired t-test for twogroup comparison. p values below 0.05 were considered
significant. The cooperative index (CI) was calculated as
the sum of the specific cell deaths induced by the single
agents divided by the specific cell death in response to
the combination. CI values <1, = 1 and >1 indicate a
synergistic, additive or infra-additive effect respectively
