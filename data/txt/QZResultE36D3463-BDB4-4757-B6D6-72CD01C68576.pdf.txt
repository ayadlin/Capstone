ABSTRACT
Frequent genetic alterations discovered in FGFRs and evidence implicating some
as drivers in diverse tumors has been accompanied by rapid progress in targeting
FGFRs for anticancer treatments. Wider assessment of the impact of genetic changes
on the activation state and drug responses is needed to better link the genomic
data and treatment options. We here apply a direct comparative and comprehensive
analysis of FGFR3 kinase domain variants representing the diversity of pointmutations reported in this domain. We reinforce the importance of N540K and
K650E and establish that not all highly activating mutations (for example R669G)
occur at high-frequency and conversely, that some “hotspots” may not be linked to
activation. Further structural characterization consolidates a mechanistic view of FGFR
kinase activation and extends insights into drug binding. Importantly, using several
inhibitors of particular clinical interest (AZD4547, BGJ-398, TKI258, JNJ42756493 and
AP24534), we find that some activating mutations (including different replacements
of the same residue) result in distinct changes in their efficacy. Considering that
there is no approved inhibitor for anticancer treatments based on FGFR-targeting,
this information will be immediately translatable to ongoing clinical trials.

Recent applications of deep sequencing technologies
have resulted in the discovery of frequent alterations
in FGFR molecules; the alterations include pointmutations, overexpression and fusion genes [7–9]. Very
recent analysis of about 5000 solid tumors provided a
comprehensive picture of the FGFR alterations in cancer
[10], generally consistent with the data combined from
individual, smaller studies reported previously (examples
include [11–17]). Based on these studies it is likely that
FGFR aberrations occur in about 7% of solid tumors
and almost every type of malignancy examined has been
associated with FGFR aberrations; most commonly
affected were urothelial, breast, endometrial, squamous

INTRODUCTION
Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors
(FGFR1-4) regulate a wide range of physiological processes
including embryogenesis, wound healing, inflammation
and angiogenesis as well as adult tissue homeostasis [1,
2]. Importantly, aberrant FGF/FGFR signaling has been
linked to several developmental syndromes and a broad
range of human malignancies [3, 4]. The involvement in the
pathology of many cancer types provides a strong rationale
for development of effective agents for these targets;
consequently, there is a large ongoing effort to develop
FGFR inhibitors as anticancer treatments [5, 6].

quantitatively. Furthermore, it is not clear how different
primary or acquired mutations can affect responses to
the emerging clinically promising inhibitors, including
a number of nonselective and selective TKIs. Because
all currently tested TKIs inhibit receptor kinase activity
by interfering with the binding of ATP or substrates of
the tyrosine kinase domain, mutations occurring within
this domain are likely to be particularly relevant in this
context. With these aims in mind, here we describe the
effect of FGFR KD mutations on kinase activity, using
a comprehensive panel, and distinct signatures of drug
efficacy for different activating FGFR variants.

lung cancers and ovarian cancer. The most frequently
detected aberration appears to be gene amplification,
in particular amplification of FGFR1, resulting in
overexpression. Rearrangements resulting in fusion
proteins (the most frequent being FGFR3TACC3-fusion)
have been so far observed in smaller numbers compared to
amplifications and mutations. Point-mutations have been
detected in all FGFRs and are likely to represent about one
third of all aberrations; they appear to be more frequent in
FGFR3 and FGFR2 compared with FGFR1 and FGFR4.
The field of FGFR targeting has progressed
rapidly in recent years especially owing to the further
evaluation of nonselective and the development of novel
FGFR-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), many
of which are currently in clinical trials [6]. The most
clinically advanced compounds are nonselective TKIs
(including ponatinib, brivanib, nintedanib, lenvatinib,
dovitinib and lucitanib) that also have inhibitory activity
against some other RTKs (such as VEGFRs). However,
accumulative side effects and a modest efficacy of some
of these compounds towards FGFRs have prompted the
development of selective and highly potent FGFR TKIs,
including AZD4547, BGJ-398 and JNJ42756493 [18–20].
It is also becoming apparent that optimal therapeutic
application of FGFR inhibitors requires knowledge of the
molecular profiles of populations that will benefit most
from these drugs. Data providing information about the
rates and types of FGFR aberrations in a variety of cancer
types, as summarized above, will no doubt help to aid
design of clinical trials.
The next rate-liming step to understand the clinical
implications of such abundant genomic data, however,
is the wider assessment of the causative role of these
alterations found in cancer; the impact on protein function,
including activation state and drug responses, needs to be
assessed. In particular, point mutations occur in all regions
of the receptor molecules including extracellular, transmembrane and kinase domains of FGFR1-4, suggesting
diverse outcomes and mechanisms [7, 9]. Several preclinical studies focusing on some of the frequently
observed mutations demonstrated their oncogenic
potential. For example, FGFR3 extracellular S249C
substitution that occurs in more than 70% of urothelial
tumors harboring mutations has been shown to enhance
receptor phosphorylation, downstream signaling, saturation
density in urothelial cells and to induce transformation
of mouse fibroblasts [21]. Furthermore, viability and
proliferation of some cancer cell lines with the FGFR3
S249C substitution was compromised by FGFR inhibitors
including the FGFR-specific AZD4547 compound [22].
Among FGFR kinase domain (KD) cancer mutations,
another FGFR3 activating mutation, K650E, has been
most extensively characterized [14, 21, 23]. However,
to our knowledge, there is to date no comprehensive
study in which different FGFR cancer variants have been
directly compared and the impact of mutations assessed

RESULTS
Reported mutations in FGFR KD
To obtain a comprehensive insight into mutations
affecting the intracellular portion (and in particular KD)
of FGFRs, we compiled missense mutation data and
performed multiple sequence and structure-based analyses
(Figure 1, Supplementary Table S1).
The intracellular portion (residues 397-806 for
FGFR3) comprises the juxtamembrane region, KD and
C-terminal regions. The number of observed mutations
at each residue within the intracellular portion of FGFR3
was compiled from several cancer databases (COSMIC,
TCGA, ICGC and BioMuta) covering all cancer types
(Figure 1A, top). Considering the high degree of similarity
between FGFR1-4, the same analysis was also performed
for all FGFRs and displayed using amino acid numbering
for FGFR3 (Figure 1A, bottom). Two frequently mutated
positions (“hotspots”) were identified in FGFR3 KD in
cancer (K650 and G697) and a third (corresponding to
N540 in FGFR3) was revealed only when considering
all FGFRs (Figure 1A). The most frequent amino acid
replacements at the position corresponding to FGFR3
K650 were E and M while others such as N, Q and T were
observed less frequently. For the position corresponding
to FGFR3 N540, the most frequent mutation was to K
compared to S, D or H. The frequent replacement G697C
was reported only for FGFR3 (Figure 1A).
It has been previously highlighted that a number of
cancer mutations, in particular in FGFR2 and FGFR3, have
also been described in various developmental syndromes
such as bone dysplasia [4]. Positions mutated in FGFR3
in this type of dysplasia (Figure 1B top) included not only
one of the hotspots observed in FGFR3 in cancer (K650)
(Figure 1A top) but also the N540 hotspot position (Figure 1A
bottom). N540 FGFR3 mutations in bone dysplasia reflect
the overall picture of FGFR1-4 mutations in cancer with
the replacement N540K being the most frequently observed
[24](Figure 1B top). A distinct pattern of cancer mutations
in FGFR1-4 can reflect differences in cancer types and their
etiology, with FGFR3 mutations being most prevalent in a
single cancer type (i.e bladder cancer) [7–9].

Comparison of positions mutated in bone dysplasia
in all FGFRs with those reported for FGFR3 in cancer
(Figure 1B, bottom) highlighted common residues
including I538, N540, K650 and R669. With respect to
the secondary structure (Figure 1C), I538 and N540 are
in the αC-β4 linker, K650 in the activation (A)-loop and
R669 in αEF-β12 linker. The hot spot position G697 has
not been observed in bone dysplasia in any of FGFRs and
is present within the αF- αG linker.
A number of crystal structures of FGFR KD in
non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms have
been reported [25]. The 3D-structures highlighted the
features that undergo substantial changes and play a key
role in the activation process; of particular importance is
the A-loop and so called “molecular brake” (Figure 1D,
Supplementary Figure S1). When positions of FGFR3
cancer mutations are highlighted in the FGFR KD
structure, one hot spot (K650) and 9 other residues are
present within the A-loop while R669 is in its vicinity.
Residues N540 and I538 are part of the molecular brake.
In a broader context, linking genetic data with
the functional outcome remains a challenge and the
accuracy is such that most predictions should be seen
as complementary to - rather than a replacement for experimental evaluation [26, 27]. In addition to ranking
based on observed mutation frequencies, there are
a number of bioinformatics tools that can assess the
possible impacts of a mutation (Supplementary Table S1A,
Supplementary Figure S2). Many algorithms assume that
mutations affecting protein function occur at evolutionarily
conserved sites and the meta-predictor CONsensus
DELeteriousness score (Condel) combines several of these
[28]. More sophisticated predictors make use of available
protein structures (such as SAAP, that predicts outcomes
using multiple features, or 3D-clustering). Some structurebased tools allow prediction of the energetic impacts of
mutations; we used FOLDX [29] to predict changes in
stability for all possible FGFR3 KD mutations and ranked
them. Stability differences between active and inactive KD
can predict mutations expected to shift equilibrium from
inactive to active conformations.
We used these tools for analysis of all reported
intracellular FGFR3 cancer mutations and also included
some common mutations found in other FGFRs or in bone
dysplasia. Based on this, we constructed a representative
panel for experimental evaluation that covers different
structural elements of the KD, frequencies, cancer types
and different prediction outcomes (Table 1). The panel
includes about 47% of all intracellular residues reported
to be mutated in FGFR3 in cancer.

replacements at positions corresponding to FGFR3 K650
and mutation corresponding to FGFR3 N540K [14, 21,
23, 30, 31]. Some comparisons of mutations found in
the context of bone dysplasia have also been reported
[32–34]. However, very few studies compared a panel of
cancer mutations or directly and quantitatively measured
kinase activity; no such studies have been applied to
FGFR3 KD.
Isolated FGFR KDs undergo auto-phosphorylation
on several tyrosine residues and this property correlates
well with the kinase activity towards natural and
synthetic substrates. We used purified proteins of 26
FGFR3 KD variants to directly compare the impact of
different mutations on FGFR3 KD auto-phosphorylation
(Figure 2A). The most frequent mutations at the hotspot
positions, K650E and N540K, resulted in a large increase
(up to 45-fold) in auto-phosphorylation. Interestingly, at
both positions, the mutations observed less frequently,
K650N and N540S, were also less activating. However,
surprisingly, the most activating mutation in this assay
was a non-hotspot mutation R669G. Another replacement
at this position, R669Q, also resulted in an increase
of auto-phosphorylation. The least activating among
variants that increased FGFR3 KD auto-phosphorylation
more than 7-fold was the I538V mutation. Results from
further analysis of these activating variants in a substrate
phosphorylation assay (Figure 2B, top panel) were
generally consistent with the auto-phosphorylation data
(Figure 2A).
Several other mutations, including V555M,
D641G and D641N resulted in an increase of autophosphorylation up to 7-fold (Figure 2A) and a similar
increase in substrate phosphorylation (Figure 2B, middle
panel). The V555M mutation, unlike other mutations
in this panel, is an acquired resistance mutation to an
FGFR inhibitor (AZ12908010) where the gatekeeper
residue, V555, is replaced by a larger side-chain residue
[22]. Gatekeeper mutations have been described in many
kinases and several studies have shown an associated
increase in kinase activity [35–37].
Twelve out of 26 analyzed mutations had very little
or no effect on FGFR3 KD activity (Figure 2A and 2B,
bottom panel). The number of observations in cancer
for most of these mutations is low with the exception of
G697C that represents one of the hotspots (Figure 1A).
Two mutations, D617G and G637W, completely
abolished kinase activity (Figure 2A and 2B, bottom
panel). Both residues are strongly conserved among
protein kinases and some of the replacements of these
residues in various kinases have been tested and shown
to result in inactivation [38, 39]. D617 is the key catalytic
residue and part of the HRD motif in the C-loop, while
G637 resides in the A-loop as a part of the DFG motif. The
DFG motif is surprisingly frequently mutated in the cancer
kinome [38]. However, a G to W replacement has not been
observed and tested previously and, as shown in Figure 2B

in cancer as well as in FGFR2 in bone dysplasia
(Supplementary Table S1). To assess the mechanism
that underpins activation, we first analyzed the R to
G replacement in the context of FGFR1 KD that is
more amenable to crystallography compared to FGFR3
KD. As shown in Figure 4B, R675G FGFR1 KD
variant also has higher activity compared to the WT.
X-ray data collection and refinement statistics for the
R675G FGFR1 KD 3D structure are summarized in
Supplementary Table S2.
Comparison of this new FGFR1 R675G KD
structure (Figure 4C, top) with inactive (apo) FGFR1
KD (PDB: 4UWY) and active, FGFR1-3P (pdb 3GQI)
(Figure 4C, bottom) structures shows that FGFR1 R675G
KD differs from the inactive form and adopts a fold with
great similarity to the active KD. Notably, in the inactive
FGFR1 KD there is direct hydrogen bonding between
R675 and H650 from the A-loop; in addition, R675
is found to share a tight van der Waals interaction with
active site tyrosine Y653 and H650 (Figure 4C, bottom
left inset). These interactions are disturbed and broken in
R675G mutant (Figure 4C, top inset), thus favoring the
A-loop to adopt an open conformation as found in the
active FGFR1-3P (Figure 4C, bottom right inset). In turn,
this open conformation of the A-loop leads to several
rearrangements of various control elements in the KD –
including ordering of spine residues, dissociation in the
molecular brake interacting residues, repositioning of the
αC-helix and movement of the N-lobe toward the C-lobe.
To gain further insight into the activation mechanism
of the R669G mutation in FGFR3, we performed NMR
studies in which we compared the backbone amide
chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) associated with the
R669G mutation with those of the WT FGFR3 KD. Our
results show that in addition to localized differences
around the mutation, there are other differences in distant
elements, consistent with a broader conformational change
(Supplementary Figure S3). Of particular note are the
significant CSPs in the αC-β4 loop and at the C-terminal
end of the αC-helix, which likely report on the release of
the molecular brake by the R669G mutation. The CSPs
in helix αG and in the αF-αG linker also suggest altered
interactions with the αEF helix and the activation loop,
consistent with promotion of an active conformation.
Previous structural studies of FGFR2 KD
highlighted a long-range allosteric communication linking
the kinase hinge, the αC-helix and the A-loop [41]. It
was also illustrated that some A-loop mutations (such as
FGFR3 K650E), by forcing an active conformation of the
loop, can change via this allosteric network the position of
the αC-helix and also dissociate the molecular brake [23,
41]. We suggest a similar allosteric mechanism for FGFR1
R675G and corresponding FGFR3 R669G mutation that is
in this case triggered by the loss of inhibitory interactions
in the vicinity of the A-loop that involve the R675/669
residue.

(bottom panel), also results in kinase inactivation. In
general, the importance of these inactivating mutations
for cancer development remains unclear and specifically
for FGFRs it could be linked to their suggested, contextdependent tumour protective functions [40].
From these direct measurements of kinase activity
it seems that a considerable number of mutations reported
so far result in kinase activation to some degree and
that replacements that cause activation are not limited
to hotspot positions (Figures 2A and 2B). However,
the comparison of a highly activating K650E and
phosphorylated WT FGFR3 KD suggests that even these
mutations do not fully convert mutated molecules to their
active conformations (Figure 2C).
It could be expected that some mutations that map to
the KD do not affect kinase activity directly as measured
under conditions in vitro. In particular, the hotspot G697C
mutation which does not have an effect in such assays
(Figure 2A and 2B, bottom panel) could impact on
FGFR3 function in a way that can only be detected in a
cellular setting. To test this possibility, a stably transfected
FGFR3 G697C NIH3T3 cell line was compared with
cell lines expressing two other hotspot variants, K650E
and N540K, and the WT FGFR3 cell line (Figure 3). In
contrast to cell lines expressing FGFR3 K650E and N540K
mutations, FGFR3 G697C NIH3T3 cell line did not
show a transformed phenotype (Figure 3A) or anchorage
independent growth (Figure 3B); there was no detectable
increase in downstream phosphorylation events and levels
of phospho-FGFR were comparable to the WT (Figure 3C).
Analysis of the FGFR3 R669G NIH3T3 cell line
has shown that despite low expression levels, downstream
signaling appeared to be enhanced as well as FGFR3
phosphorylation (Figure 4A).
Comparison of our experimental data (Figure 2)
with the assessments obtained using bioinformatics
tools (Supplementary Table S1B and S1C) suggests
that considering multiple methods together can
provide insight into the influences of many panel
mutations. Condel predicts three pathogenic mutations
(E466K, D617G and G637W) that either reduce
protein production or completely inactivate the kinase.
Stabilization of active kinase is indicated by FOLDX
with good specificity, but low sensitivity. However, most
highly activating or moderately activating mutations
have supporting evidence from either FOLDX or
clustering (Supplementary Table S1B, Supplementary
Figure S2). In particular, although not a hotspot, R669
is within an identified cluster of observed A-loop cancer
mutations.

Structural insights into drug binding

[44]. To help rationalize functional differences between
these compounds we generated the structure of FGFR1
in complex with JNJ42756493 by soaking the compound
into preformed crystals of FGFR1 KD in which there
are two molecules of FGFR1 in the crystallographic
asymmetric unit. The two monomers are highly similar,
exhibiting rmsd values of 0.39 Å over 280 Å and 0.09 Å
over 39 Å within 6 Å of the JNJ42756493 binding site.

Several recent structural studies revealed binding
pockets of some selective (BGJ-398 and AZD4547) and
non-selective (TKI258 and AP24534) FGFR inhibitors
in complexes with FGFR1 KD [37, 42, 43]. For the
FGFR-selective inhibitor JNJ42756493 there is much less
reported information despite its promise for clinical use

Further discussion will therefore refer to the structure of
monomer A. The overall structure of FGFR1 KD bound to
JNJ42756493 is shown in Figure 5A.
JNJ42756493 occupies the ATP-binding cleft of
FGFR1 largely as expected on the basis of previous
complexes between FGFR1 and other type-I inhibitors (e.
g. BJG-398, AZD4547, PD173074 and TKI258) and where
the activation loop clearly exhibits a DFG-in conformation.
The quinoxaline core of JNJ42756493 is observed to form a

single hydrogen bond to the hinge region via the main chain
amide of A564 while the dimethoxyphenyl ring is orientated
perpendicular to the quinoxaline core and occupies the
hydrophobic pocket located behind the gatekeeper residue
(V561). One of the methoxy oxygen atoms is involved in
a hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen atom of the
DFG aspartate (D641). The methyl pyrazole solubilizing
group extends away from the hinge region towards the
solvent channel and does not make any specific interactions

with the protein. A structural comparison of various drug
compounds (JNJ42756493, BGJ-398, AZD4547, TKI258
and AP24534; Supplementary Figure S4) bound to FGFR1
KD clearly indicates that a unique feature of JNJ42756493
is the amide side chain which extends into the region of the
binding site normally occupied by the a-phosphate of ATP
where it forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of D641.
In addition the terminal isopropyl group of this side chain
also makes good van der Waals interactions with the protein
in a shallow pocket formed by the side chains of N628,
L630, A640 and D641 that has previously been referred
to as the “pit” region [45]. Interestingly this indentation
in FGFR1 has previously been found to be occupied
by a methyl isoxazole moiety in a series of compounds
containing a pyrazole core (PDB numbers: 4F64, 4F65,
4NK9, 4NKA and 4NKS). The side chain modification
to JNJ42756493 therefore likely makes a significant
contribution to its overall binding strength and specificity.
Considering that JNJ42756493, BGJ-398, AZD4547,
TKI258 and AP24534 are all in clinical trials, structural
comparison of their binding to FGFR KD (Supplementary
Figure S4) will contribute to understanding their clinical
differences.

described in FGFR3 (V555M) [22, 37]. The question
of how primary mutations in FGFR KDs, in particular
activating mutations, affect drug efficacy has not been
addressed directly although studies of FGFR2 resistance
mutations to TKI258 using BaF3 cells suggested this
possibility [46]. However, with a number of FGFR
inhibitors now in clinical trials it is important to establish
accurately their comparative efficacies towards different
FGFR variants.
We performed measurements of Ki for AZD4547,
BGJ-398, TKI258, JNJ42756493 and AP24534
using purified FGFR3 KD WT and variants R669G,
K650E, N540S, N540K, V555M and I538V (Figure
6, Supplementary Table S3). Ki values for the WT
FGFR3 KD show the first direct comparison of these
compounds (Figure 6A); several previous studies
focused on a single drug [18, 19, 47]. JNJ42756493 is
the most effective (Ki about 2 nM), closely followed
by AZD4547 (Ki about 4.5 nM) while another FGFRspecific inhibitor BGJ-398 has a Ki value similar to
pan-kinase inhibitors TKI258 and AP24534 (within the
range 65-95 nM) (Figure 6A, Supplementary Table S3).
Mutations selected for this study include the gatekeeper
(V555M) and several other activating mutations that
are in the vicinity of the ATP binding pocket (N540S,
N540K and I538V); R669G and K650E mutations are
further away – however, they could have an allosteric
effect (Figure 6B).
The impact of each mutation on drug binding is
expressed as a fold-difference in Ki compared to the

DISCUSSION

FGFR3 KD WT (Figure 6C). Highly activating R669G
and, in particular, hotspot mutation K650E had moderate
effects on the efficacy of all inhibitors; all changes for
K650E were within 4–fold (Figure 6C, Supplementary
Table S3). In contrast, mutations at the hotspot position
N540 had a more pronounced effect (up to 23-fold) and
most affected the compounds with low Ki values, with
the N540K substitution affecting AZD4547 more and
N540S affecting JNJ42756493 more. As expected, the
gatekeeper V555M mutation, conferring resistance to
AZ12908010 (similar to AZD4547), had an impact on
the efficacy of AZD4547 (about 20-fold). The change
in efficacy of JNJ42756493 due to V555M mutation
was even greater (about 200-fold) representing the
biggest change observed in this panel. Interestingly, as
we reported previously [37], the affinity of TKI258 for
V555M was higher compared to the WT. Residue I538
is in contact with N540 in the 3D structure [41] and the
mutation I538V had substantial effect (up to 40-fold) on
all inhibitors.
We further compared the effect of the two
most potent FGFR-specific inhibitors AZD4547 and
JNJ42756493 on hotspot mutations K650E and N540K
in NIH3T3 cell lines. As previously reported [37] and
shown in Supplementary Figure S5 NIH3T3 cells stably
transfected with the “empty” expression vector are only
marginally affected by FGFR inhibitors. An NIH3T3
cell line expressing FGFR3TACC3-fusion protein
was used for comparison with the K650E and N540K
NIH3T3 cell lines because the FGFR3 KD in this fusion
has the WT sequence and, furthermore, this cell line
has similarly transformed phenotype (Figure 6D). For
the WT KD, AZD4547 and JNJ42756493 cellular IC50s
reflect the in vitro differences of about 2-3 fold (Figure
6D, left and Supplementary Table S3). The K650E and
N540K variants reduce efficacy of both compounds
with the larger impact by the N540K mutation also
showing a considerable difference between AZD4547
and JNJ42756493 for this mutant (Figure 6D, middle
and right).
Some of the differences between the effects of
tested inhibitors on activating FGFR variants (Figure 6)
are consistent with observations from structural
studies. Based on the crystal structure of FGFR1 KD
V561M, the interactions of the inhibitors within the
ATP-binding pocket, and their chemical structures
(Supplementary Figure S1), it is expected that the efficacy
of the JNJ42756493 towards FGFR3 V555M would
be particularly affected. Contributing factors include
the higher rigidity of this compound, compared with
AZD4547 and BGJ-398, and the nature of occupancy of
the ATP-binding pocket resulting in higher affinity (Figure
5, Supplementary Figure S1). In general, 3D structures
alone are not sufficient to fully understand the mode and
strength of drug binding [48] highlighting the importance
of direct measurements performed here.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Many clinically relevant cancer mutations were
identified based on recurrence rates. However, this
strategy cannot be readily applied to alterations that occur
in a minority of tumors or to situations where different,
rare mutations create the same neoplastic phenotype via
different mechanisms. In fact, some of these mutations
are of functional significance and likely constitute drivers,
therapeutic targets or mechanisms of therapy resistance
[49]. Here we have applied a direct comparative analysis
of FGFR KD variants that represent the diversity of all
mutations found in cancer and characterized their impact
on kinase activity; for a subset of activating mutations we
have also established their responsiveness to several drugs
of particular clinical interest.
Our data reinforce the importance of frequently
observed mutations at positions corresponding to FGFR3
N540 and K650 that occur in different FGFRs and in a
range of cancer types as well as in bone dysplasia (Figures
1–3, Supplementary Table S1) [7, 9, 24]. In particular,
replacements N to K and K to E at the respective positions
are highly activating in vitro and transforming in NIH3T3
cells (Figures 2 and 3). In contrast, we have not been
able to provide supporting evidence for an activating
nature of FGFR3 mutation G697C (Figure 2 and 3). A
relatively high number of observations of this mutation
highlight FGFR3 G697C as another hotspot mutation
(Figure 1). However, all observations of FGFR3 G697C
were reported in a single study of oral squamous cell
carcinomas (OSCC) [50]. It is possible that the activating
potential of this mutation could be context dependent and
involve interaction with another component(s) present in
this type of epithelial cells. Interestingly, another study
examining a comparable number of OSCC cases from
a different population failed to detect FGFR3 G697C,
arguing that this mutation is unlikely to be common
even in this cancer type [51]. It is also conceivable that
the occurrence of this mutation in a specific population
could be unrelated to FGFR activation and involvement
in OSCC. Further studies, focusing on FGFR3 G697C in
epithelial cells rather than on comparative analysis shown
here, would be needed to confirm this possibility.
A number of non-hotspot mutations have an
impact on kinase activity, mainly resulting in moderate
activation (Figure 2). At least some of these mutations
are likely to have clinical relevance and they include a
gatekeeper mutation (FGFR3 V555M) and a mutation
(corresponding to FGFR3 I538V) also identified
in a developmental disorder (hypochondroplasia)
(Supplementary Table S1). The importance of mutations
resulting in a lower degree of activation has been
illustrated in developmental disorders, linking these
mutations to less severe syndromes [52]; it is also
possible that they could contribute to generation or
progression of tumors or may be selected for after the

selective pressure of anti-FGFR treatments. Moreover,
we have established that an infrequent cancer mutation
corresponding to R669G in FGFR3, also found in bone
dysplasia, greatly enhances kinase activity of FGFR
(Figures 1 and 2). One observation that could be related
to its low reported frequency in cancer is the finding of
low expression levels of this mutation in transfected
mammalian cells (compared to FGFR3 N540K, K650E
or WT) (Figure 4) that might compromise its impact
or could require additional changes in cancer cells
to increase its stability or expression. Nevertheless,
structural studies of this mutation in the context of
FGFR1 KD (R675G) are fully consistent with its
activating potential. Furthermore, we here reveal a
new feature of FGFR KD that stabilizes the inactive
conformation which, when disrupted by mutations,
can result in activation – namely, a set of interactions
in the vicinity of the A-loop that involve R669/675
(Figure 4). Our new structural insights also consolidate
observations resulting from structural studies of several
other activating variants including FGFR2 N549H/T
mutations in the molecular brake, FGFR2 K659N
and FGFR3 K650E in the A-loop and FGFR1 V651M
gatekeeper mutation affecting the regulatory spine [23,
37, 41]. Although R669/675 and these other mutations
affect different regions in FGFR KD, the local structural
changes trigger alterations in FGFR KD allosteric
networks resulting in a shift towards conformations
resembling an active form of phosphorylated kinase.
Combined with several recent structural studies
of inhibitory compounds bound to FGFR KDs [37, 42,
43], our crystal structure of the JNJ42756493/FGFR1
KD complex provides a detailed picture of common
features and key differences in the extent and nature
of their binding interactions (Figure 5, Supplementary
Figure S4). While these structures provide an important
basis for understanding and improving the function of
FGFR inhibitors, there are also limitations, in particular
understanding the consequence of specific FGFR
mutations requires direct experimental assessment.
Indeed, our direct measurements of Ki values in vitro
and evaluation of effects in cells show a complex picture
where different mutations, including replacements
of the same residue, can have very profound effects
on the efficacy of some inhibitors but not on others
(Figures 6C and 6D). In the case of FGFR3 acquired
gatekeeper mutation (V555M), this is illustrated by
about 200-fold reduction in efficacy for JNJ42756493
and an increase in efficacy for TKI258 (Figure 6C).
Considering a good correlation between in vitro and in
vivo effects of FGFR inhibitors in our previous study
[37], these data are likely to be relevant for a cellular
setting. Consistent with the in vitro data, we have
observed loss of efficacy for PD173074 with the effect
of TKI258 retained following introduction of FGFR3
V555M mutation in a cell line originally responding to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

both drugs [37]. Because JNJ42756493 is also effective
towards FGFR4 [20], these findings could be important
when considering the use of JNJ42756493 as a first-line
treatment; primary, activating mutations corresponding
to gatekeeper replacements have been reported in
rhabdomyosarcoma (FGFR4 V550L and V550E) and
in breast cancer (FGFR4 V550M) [16, 38]. Another
example that could inform the use of FGFR-selective
inhibitors in the clinic is the effect of the hotspot
N540K mutation on JNJ42756493 and AZD4547 that
shows a larger impact on AZD4547 both in vitro and
in cells (Figures 6C and 6D). Differential responses
(response to TKI258 and AP24534 compared with
reduced sensitivity to PD173074) due to the mutation
corresponding to N540K, introduced in FGFR2 in the
context of the JHUEM-2 cancer cell line, have been
previously observed [46].
For aberrations where the FGFR KD retains the WT
sequence (such as overexpression and a number of fusion
proteins) the efficacy of both JNJ42756493 and AZD4547
could be expected to be high, as we illustrate here using
the WT protein in vitro and FGFR3TACC3-fusion in cells
(Figures 6A and 6D). More broadly, previous assessments
of efficacy of several FGFR-specific inhibitors in separate
studies have shown a good response in cancers with gene
amplification of the FGFR WT or fusion proteins; these
studies were based on available panels of cancer cell lines
and tumor xenografts [22, 42, 53–55]. However, there are
only a few cancer cell lines harboring point mutations in
the FGFR KD with just two mutations being represented,
FGFR3 K650E and FGFR2 N550K. Due to various
changes that co-occur with FGFR mutations in each of
these cell lines, it was difficult to assess and compare
their responses and obtain conclusive data. Therefore,
our studies of drug efficacy performed in vitro and in
stable cell lines, complement and expand these previous
assessments and reveal differential, drug-specific impacts
of different FGFR KD mutations.

For the cell viability assay in the presence of
FGFR inhibitors, NIH3T3 cells transfected with the
stated FGFR3 variants were plated in 96-well plates,
1000 cells per well. Twenty-four hours later the cells
were treated with various concentrations of kinase
inhibitor. Forty-eight hours later, fresh inhibitor was
added and the cells incubated for 72 hours. Cell viability
was measured through the addition of CellTiter-Glo
(Promega) and luminenscence measured with a standard
luminometer plate reader. Data were normalised and
fitted to a log(inhibitor) vs. response curve (three
parameters) with GraphPad Prism.
