ABSTRACT
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the most invasively malignant
human cancers and its incidence increases year by year. Effective therapeutics against
them needs to be developed urgently. In this study, a kind of angiopep-2 modified
and intelligently particle size-reducible NPs, Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP, was designed for
accomplishing both high accumulation and deep penetration within tumor tissues. On
one hand, for improving the cancerous targeting efficiency of NPs, angiopep-2 was
anchored on the surface of NPs to facilitate their accumulation via binding with low
density lipoprotein-receptor related protein (LRP) overexpressed on TNBC. On the
other hand, for achieving high tumor retention and increasing tumor penetration, an
intelligently particle size-reducible NPs were constructed through fabricating gelatin
NPs (GNP) with doxorubicin (DOX) loaded dendrigraft poly-lysine (DGL). In vitro
cellular uptake and ex-vivo imaging proved the tumor targeting effect of Angio-DOXDGL-GNP. Additionally, the degradation of large-sized Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP by matrix
metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) led to the size reduction from 185.7 nm to 55.6 nm.
More importantly, the penetration ability of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP after incubation
with MMP-2 was dominantly enhanced in tumor spheroids. Due to a combinational
effect of active targeting and deep tumor penetration, the tumor growth inhibition
rate of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP was 74.1% in a 4T1 breast cancer bearing mouse model,
which was significantly higher than other groups. Taken together, we successfully
demonstrated a promising and effective nanoplatform for TNBC treatment.

around tumor sites, reducing the concentration of
chemical drugs delivered by NPs and compromising
the therapeutic effect. Secondly, after accumulating
around tumors, NPs faced vastly diffusional hinderance
due to the presence of the compressed intratumoral
blood and lymphatic vessels and the dense collagenrich extracellular matrix (ECM). Therefore, they were
always unable to access into the nonvascularized and
anoxic regions within deep tumor parenchyma, and
the cancerous cells of core area are still aggressively
survived, resulting in chemotherapeutic bland and latent
crisis for tumor metastasis and regeneration [8, 9]. Based
on these considerations, the development of novel NPs

INTRODUCTION
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which does
not express or express low levels of estrogen receptor,
progesterone receptor and HER2/neu, is one of the most
invasively malignant human cancers and its incidence
increases year by year [1, 2]. Currently, there only exist
few standard therapies for TNBC [3]. The development
of nanoparticles (NPs), as tools of nanomedicine, has
made significant advances towards TNBC treatment [4].
Unfortunately, the therapeutic efficiency of NPs is
usually unsatisfied [5–7]. Firstly, the targeting ability of
conventional NPs is too low to effectively accumulate

for TNBC is still urgently needed and the above two
issues should be addressed.
For improving the tumor targeting efficiency of
NPs, a variety of ligands are modified on the surface of
NPs in favor to actively tumorous accumulation [10–12].
Considering the overexpression of LRP1 on TNBC cells,
the corresponding peptide, angiopep-2 was employed
to decorate NPs to endow our NPs with active TNBC
targeting ability [13]. Furthermore, size-alterable NPs are
constructed for overcoming the diffusional hinderance
within tumors. Compared with small-sized NPs, NPs
with larger size (100–200 nm) usually possessed higher
tumor accumulation abilities [14, 15], but their diffusional
abilities within tumor were severely impeded by the dense
ECM and high tumor interstitial pressure, thus yielding
a heterogeneous distribution in solid tumors [16, 17]. In
contrast, small-sized NPs displayed superior permeability
within tumor tissues but largely restricted by fast clearance
in vivo [18–21]. Thus size-reducible NPs were developed
for addressing the low tumor accumulation and limited
tumor penetration. Taking together, angiopep-2 modified
and intelligently size-reducible NPs were developed to
effectively deliver drugs to TNBC.
In our study, Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP with coreshell nanostructure, were designed to integrate the active
tumor targeting and size-shrinkable property. As shown
in Figure 1, the core was composed of gelatin NPs (GNP)
degraded by MMP-2, while the shell was made up of DGL
linked with DOX and angiopep-2. During blood circulation,
Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP could effectively accumulate
around in tumor sites through passive and active tumor
targeting [22, 23]. Then the core of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP
was dissembled when exposed to MMP-2 overexpressed
in TNBC [24–26] and released the small-sized AngioDOX-DGL-PEG, facilitating the delivery of NPs to the
core area to kill more viable cells [24, 27]. Specifically, in
consideration of the uniformly small size (4 ~ 7 nm) and
structural modifications for specific biomedical applications,
DGL was employed as the small-sized carriers linked with
angiopep-2 [28–30]. Moreover, with the aim to examine
the ability of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP’s targeting effect and
therapeutic effect, DOX was attached to DGL via a pHsensitive cis-aconitic anhydride bond [31, 32]. In deed, our
in vitro and in vivo results indicated that Angio-DOX-DGLGNP possessed notable tumor accumulation and penetration
abilities, thus maximizing antitumor effect.

the primary amino of DOX was 3328 cm−1 and 3523 cm−1,
while cis-aconitic anhydride-doxorubicin (CAD) was
in 3423 cm−1 consistent with the absorption band of the
secondary amino groups, indicating the formation of
amide bond and successive synthesis of CAD (Figure S1A
and  S1B). In NMR spectra of Angio-PEG-DGL, the
solvent peak of D2O was found at 4.65 ppm. The repeat
units (-O-CH2-CH2-O-) of PEG presented as a sharp peak
at 3.4–3.6 ppm (Figure S1C). The methylene protons of
branching units of DGL had double peaks between 1 ppm
and 2 ppm. The peaks between 6.7 ppm and 7.3 ppm
proved the existence of angiopep-2. Finally, the activated
carboxyl groups of CAD were grafted on the amino groups
of Angio-DGL-PEG via amide linkage to obtain the final
product: Angio-DOX-DGL-PEG.
The particle size of Angio-DOX-DGL-PEG
and Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP were 35.1 ± 1.7 nm and
185.7 ± 3.2 nm respectively with a narrow distribution.
The drug content of Angio-DOX-DGL-PEG and AngioDOX-DGL-GNP were 10.32 ± 0.3% and 4.82 ± 0.2%,
respectively. As determined by MTT (Figure S2), the
constructed DGL-GNP was safer than DGL, suggesting
the carrier was biocompatible.

In vitro release of DOX
The in vitro release of DOX from Angio-DOXDGL-GNP was performed at pH 7.4, 6.0, 5.0 and 3.0
(Figure S3). The drug release rate obviously increased
as reduction of pH value. Little amount of DOX released
at pH 7.4 and the cumulative release amount was
less than10% after 24 h, suggesting the stability of cisaconitic anhydride bond under neutral pH. When the pH
decreased to 5.0, the 24 h cumulative release amount was
nearly 85%, indicating the acidic sensitivity of cis-aconitic
anhydride bond.

Degradation of GNPs triggered by MMP-2
Particle size of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP notably
decreased from 185.7 nm to 55.6 nm in the presence of
MMP-2, which was attributed to the degradation of gelatin
in Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP (Figure 2). Moreover, the
zeta potential of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP increased from
+1.65 mV to +7.48 mV, which may facilitate the cellular
uptake in tumor sites. However, the diameter of AngioDOX-DGL-PEG remained stable and the transmission
electron microscope (TEM) image also proved the same
shrinkable properties. More importantly, the degradation
of the GNP core by MMP-2 facilitated the release of smallsized Angio-DOX-DGL-PEG at tumor sites, which can
largely decrease the diffusional hinderance. All the results
suggested Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP could  accomplish
large-to-small shrinkage in response to MMP-2, thereby
penetrating into the core area in tumor sites.

in vivo tumors, such as poor drug penetration, free of
microvessel, changed protein expression and activity
and gradients of oxygen tension and nutrients [35, 36].
The distribution of different formulations in superficial
sections of 4T1 MCTs was observed. MCTs treated with

4T1 cells, which are extremely aggressive, highly
tumorigenic and metastatic, is selected as a model for
TNBC [2, 33, 34]. The multicellular tumor spheroids
(MCTs) were employed to evaluate the penetration

In vitro cellular apoptosis assay

Angio-DOX-DGL-PEG exhibited higher intensity in
all slices than that of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP, implying
that smaller-sized particles possessed better penetrating
efficiency. Moreover, Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP (with
MMP-2) displayed the similar penetration ability as
small-sized Angio-DOX-DGL-PEG, which was largely
attributing to the size shrinkable properties of AngioDOX-DGL-GNP in presence of MMP-2 (Figure 3A). By
comparison, Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP was located at the
edge of MCTs, while the fluorescence of Angio-DOXDGL-GNP pre-incubated with MMP-2 distributed more
extensively and penetrated much deeper in the distance
of 100 μm than that of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP groups
(Figure 3B). For better evaluated the permeability of NPs,
the penetrating percentage (fluorescent intensity of inner
region to edge region) at 130 μm depth was introduced
to determine the penetrating efficiency (Figure 3C). After
pre-treatment with MMP-2, the penetrating efficiency
of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP in MCTs was apparently
improved. The results confirmed that Angio-DOX-DGLGNP possessed better penetration ability after incubation
with MMP-2 and the reduction of particle size was
beneficial for enhancing penetrating  efficiency through
the tumor spheroids experiments.

As demonstrated in Figure 5, the apoptosis of 4T1
cells induced by Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP was higher
than that by DOX-DGL-GNP, suggesting angiopep-2
modification could enhance the antitumor effect. However,
the apoptosis percentage of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP was
not higher than that of Angio-DOX-DGL-PEG, which was
because the particles directly contacted with cells and this
study could not reflect the difference between particles
with different sizes.

In vivo tumor distribution and penetration
To test the biodistribution and tumor targeting
of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP in vivo, a murine 4T1
xenograft model of TNBC was established and a realtime fluorescence imaging technique was applied. At
24 h post-injection, the large-sized Angio-DOX-DGLGNP exhibited a stronger fluorescent signal at tumor site
than small-sized Angio-DOX-DGL-PEG (Figure 6, S4),
which attributed to the enhanced tumor retention effect.
More importantly, the fluorescent intensity of AngioDOX-DGL-GNP in tumor region was higher compared
with that of other groups, validating the significant tumor
targeting effect of angiopep-2 (Figure 7). Accordingly, it
was demonstrated that Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP had a high
accumulation in tumor sites as a result of a combination
of the passive and active targeting mechanisms. To
further visualize the distribution of NPs, the tumor
slices was stained with CD34 and LRP-1 (Red) and the
distribution of DOX (green) was captured (Figure 7–8).
The fluorescent intensity of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP was
remarkably higher than other groups, which benefited
from better tumor targeting and penetration effect.
Although many of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP colocalized
with microvessel, there were also fluorescence distributed
in the area free of vessel (Figure 8), suggesting the AngioDOX-DGL-GNP could penetrate deeper in tumor than
other groups.

In vitro cellular uptake study
In order to validate the enhanced cellular uptake of
Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP, 4T1 cells were incubated with
these NPs for 2 h. The fluorescent intensity of AngioDOX-DGL-GNP was significantly stronger than that
of DOX-DGL-GNP, which confirmed that Angio-DOXDGL-GNP possessed stronger ability of entering into
tumor cells (Figure 4A and 4C).

In vitro cellular uptake mechanism
Different inhibitors were utilized to conduct the
endocytosis inhibition assay. 4°C and sodium azide
were employed to deplete cellular ATP in order to
explore the impact of energy on the cellular uptake.
Colchicine, chlorpromazine and filipin were chosen to
block macropinocytosis-mediated, clathrin-mediated and
caveolin-mediated endocytosis respectively and polylysine was chosen as positive charge inhibitor [39, 40].
Ligands on the surface of NPs also correlate with the
internalization of NPs. Our data exhibited that various
mechanisms were involved in the uptake process. The
cellular uptake was remarkably reduced under 4°C and
sodium azide, implying that the endocytosis of AngioDOX-DGL-GNP was energy-correlated. Moreover,
the rate of uptake was also significantly inhibited by
colchicine, chlorpromazine and angiopep-2, indicating
that macropinocytosis, clathrin- and receptor-mediated
endocytosis were involved in the cellular uptake of AngioDOX-DGL-GNP.

In vivo therapy studies
To demonstrate the feasibility of Angio-DOXDGL-GNP for cancer treatment in vivo, the therapeutic
efficacy of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP compared with several
other NPs was evaluated in 4T1 tumor bearing mice. The
rate of tumor growth was suppressed to different degree
after intravenous administration of various formulations
compared with the control group (Figure 9). Angio-DOXDGL-GNP exerted a noticeably higher effect on tumor
inhibition compared with non-targeted NP (DOX-GNP,
DOX-DGL-GNP) and small-sized Angio-DOX-DGLPEG, which mainly ascribed to better tumor retention
effect combined with the active target ability provided by
angiopep-2. More importantly, Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP

cannot only accumulate more efficiently at tumor sites
via active targeting but also penetrate deeper within the
tumor. During the entire treatment period, no noticeable
alteration of mice body weight was observed in all groups
except DOX group, which was due to the high toxicity
of free DOX. Moreover, the images of tumor slices
using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining presented
a massive cancer cell remission after administration of
Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP (Figure 9E), suggesting AngioDOX-DGL-GNP could induce more apoptosis tumor
cells. The histologic images of main tissues stained by
H&E showed that DOX induced the necrosis of heart
with acute inflammatory cells infiltration (Figure 10). In
contrast, no noticeable changes of Angio-DOX-DGLGNP groups were visualized in comparison with control
group, indicating the application of them in vivo was safe.
Taking together, the Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP significantly
enhanced tumor targeting efficacy and possessed better
antitumor efficacy and low side effect.

[16, 27, 37, 38]. Among them, size-reducible NPs hold
most attention for its incomparable advantages such
as high accumulation and superior tumor penetration
[37, 39]. For example, Daniel S. Kohane reported a phototriggered NPs undergoing large-to-small size shrinkage
from 150 nm to 40 nm [27]. In another study, Fukumura
designed a QDs-GNP with shrinkable size triggered by
MMP-2, thus releasing small-sized QDs for deep tumor
penetration [24, 40].
In our study, significantly higher cellular uptake
of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP was observed in 4T1 cells
indicating that angiopep-2 modifying facilitated the
cellular uptake of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP. Furthermore,
size shrinkage NPs were designed to overcome the
hinderance of tumor region, thus maximizing the
antitumor effect. In our study the degradability of GNP
core was evaluated by monitoring the size change of
nanocarrier after incubation with MMP-2. The results
showed that the size of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP could
reduce from 185.7 nm to 55.6 nm, indicating GNP could
be degraded into small fragments by MMP-2 as previous
study showed [41, 42]. In vivo imaging experiment also
demonstrated that Angio-DOX-DGL-GNPs accumulated
in tumor tissues more efficiently via EPR effect and active
targeting in 4T1 tumor bearing mice. Our study expected
that after the GNP core were degraded by MMP-2, the
released small-sized Angio-DOX-DGL-PEG penetrated
into the regions away from the tumor blood vessels to
kill more cancer cells. However, the penetration ability
of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP in vivo wasn’t satisfied which
may due to the sensitivity to MMP-2 degradation, but

DISCUSSIONS
Many factors in vivo constitute challenging
hurdles for TNBC treatment such as high interstitial
fluid pressure, dense stromal tissue, complex interaction
with fibroblasts and tumor cells, thus conventional NPs
were not homogeneously distributed in tumor sites and
just achieved compromising therapeutic effects. Many
strategies were addressed to eradicating the bland area
of chemotherapy such as size-reduction, depletion of
ECM and pulsed high intensity focused ultrasound

in the evaluation of anti-TNBC effect in 4T1 grafted
model, Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP exhibited the highest
tumor growth inhibition rate than other groups, implying
that Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP accomplished our targets to
some extent. An ideal enzyme-responsive multistage NPs
should been rapidly degraded into small-sized NPs after
they accumulated in tumor sites, therefore small-sized
NPs penetrated into the core of tumor sites and released
the anticancer drug, leading to killing more tumor cells.
In fact, when the NPs reached the tumor sites by EPR
effect, the multistage NPs were degraded into small NPs
in accompany with penetration. The smaller the particle
size of NPs shrank, the deeper the NPs penetrated.
Certainly, further research was also needed for us to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

increase the responsiveness of our NPs in the future. More
importantly, in the aspect of the in vivo application of
safety of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP, no significant weight
change and hematoxylin and eosin staining results proved
that these nanocarrier were of biological safety, which was
corresponded with other researches [43, 44].

at the ratio 1: 8 (molar ratio) in pH 8.0 PBS for 2 h in

molecular weight cutoff membrane at 4500 g for 30 min.
Drug content was quantified by hydrolyzing the
glycosidic bond between the doxorubicinone and amino
sugar at acidic condition and determining the released
doxorubicinone. Different formulations (0.1 mL) was
mixed with 2.5 M HCl (0.8 mL) and methanol (1 mL), and
the mixture was incubated at 50°C for 1.5 h. The generated
doxorubicinone was analyzed by HPLC (WelchromR
C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm,5 mm particle size, Agilent
1200 series), 0.01 M KH2PO4 : acetonitrile : acetic acid
= 45 : 55 : 0.27 (v/v/v), 1.0 mL/min, 30°C, 490  nm).
A  standard curve of doxorubicinone was generated by
hydrolyzing free DOX at the same condition, then the
amount of DOX conjugation were obtained and the drug
loading efficiency were finally calculated.

3 days. Then MCTs were selected with uniform size
and then incubated with different formulations for 12 h.
Subsequently, the MCTs were rinsed thrice with cold PBS
followed by fixation of 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min
and placed in 96-well plates for confocal microscopy.

In vitro cellular uptake study
The cellular uptake of different formulations was
evaluated by fluorescent microscope, 4T1 were seeded at
a density of 5 × 104 cells/well on 6-well plates containing
square coverships for 24 h. After achieving 70%–80%
confluence, various samples (12.5 μg/mL, DOX equal)
was added to each well and incubated for 2 h. Then the
coverships were washed trice with PBS followed by fixing
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then staining
with DAPI to identify the nuclei for 5 min. Finally,
the coverships were visualized and photographed by
fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Japan).
4T1 cells were plated in 6-cell plates at a density
of 1 × 105 cells per cell and cultured for 24 h. Cells were
treated with DOX, DOX-DGL-PEG, Angio-DOX-DGLPEG, DOX-DGL-GNP and Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP at a
final DOX concentration of 12.5 μg/mL. After incubation
for 2 h, the cells were washed three times with cold PBS,
trypsinized and resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS. Then
the  fluorescent intensity was tested by flow cytometry
(BD, USA).

In vitro release
As the linker between DOX and DGL was a
pH-sensitive linker, cis-aconitic anhydride bond, in vitro
release profiles of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP (equivalent
to 0.1 mg DOX) were performed in 40 mL of PBS
(pH 7.4, 6.0, 5.0 and 3.0) medium at 37°C and 50 rpm.
The samples were sealed in a dialysis bag (MW 3500). At
predetermined intervals, 1 mL of released media was taken
away and the corresponding fresh medium was added. The
amount of released DOX was measured by fluorescence
spectrophotometer. Each drug release test was performed
thrice. Each drug release test was performed thrice.

Cellular uptake mechanism study
In order to study the uptake mechanism of
Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP, 4T1 cells were pre-incubated
with various endocytosis inhibitors including polylysine (400  μg/mL), sodium azide (0.651 mg/mL),
chlorpromazine (10 μg/mL), filipin (5 μg/mL) meanwhile
the inhibition of free angiopep-2 (250 μg/mL) for 30 min
and the effect of temperature (4°C) was also studied. Then
the inhibitors were withdrawn from the wells and the
cells were treated with Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP. After 1 h
incubation, the solution was discarded and the cells were
washed with ice-cold PBS twice and responded in 0.4 mL
PBS. The fluorescence intensity was determined by flow
cytometer (Cytomics™ FC 500, Beckman Coulter, Miami,
FL, USA).

Degradation of GNP triggered by MMP-2 in vitro
MMPs, especially MMP-2 and MMP-9, are
associated with the invasion, progression angiogenesis and
metastasis of many human cancers. The expression levels
of MMPs were found to be relatively high in breast cancer,
liver cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer and ovarian cancer,
whereas they are minimally expressed in healthy tissue
[48–51]. To investigate the enzyme-sensitivity of AngioDOX-DGL-GNP, 0.5 mL of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP
(0.4 mg) was incubated with 0.5 mL of MMP-2 in HEPES
(460 ng). At prearranged time intervals, the particle size
and zeta potential of the NPs were immediately determined
by a dynamic light scattering detector (Nano-ZS, Malvern,
UK). The morphology of Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP before
or after MMP-2 incubation was observed via TEM (JEM100CX, JEOL, Japan).

Cell apoptosis assay
The apoptosis of 4T1 cells was determined by using
Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Doshido, Japan).
Briefly, the 4T1 cells were plated in 6-well plates at a
density of 1 × 105 cells per cell and cultured for 24 h. Then
the cells were treated with different formulations at DOX
concentration of 12.5 μg/mL. After incubated at 37°C for
24 h, the cells were harvested, washed by PBS twice and
suspended in 500 μL of binding buffer. 5 μL of Annexin

Penetration assay using MCTs
4T1 cells were seeded into 96-well plates precoated with sterile agarose solution (2%, m/v) at a density
of 8 × 103 cells per well. Subsequently, the MCTs were
monitored with optical microscope in order to assure
that they form intact spheres and ready to use after

Statistical analysis

V-FITC and 5 μL of propidium iodide (PI) were added into
the cell suspension for 15 min incubation, respectively.
The cells were immediately analysed by flow cytometry
(BD, USA).

All data were displayed as mean ± SD. Statistical
difference between two groups were performed by
Students t-test. P value < 0.05 and < 0.01 were considered
indications of statistical difference and statistically
significant difference respectively.

In vivo imaging and tumor distribution
Animals were performed in accordance with
national regulations and approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Sichuan University.
4T1 tumor-bearing mice were randomly into 5 groups
and intravenously administrated with different
formulations at a dose of 5 mg/kg DOX (equal) per
mouse via the tail vein. 24 hours after administration,
the mice were sacrificed and the major organs were
further visualized. Images were taken on Bio-Real
Quick view 3000 (Geneway International, Australia)
and the fluorescence intensities were analyzed by Living
Image Software.
After dehydration with sucrose solution, the tumors
were embedded and frozen in OCT embedding medium
(Leica, Germany), frozen slices of 16 μm thickness were
prepared with cryotome Cryostat (Leica, Germany).
Subsequently, the slices were stained with rabbit mAb to
LRP1 antibody (1:100) overnight, followed by staining
with secondary antibody Cy3-conjugated Affinipure Goat
Anti-Rabbit IgG(H+L) and 0.5 μg/mL of DAPI at room
temperature. After washing with PBS trice, the slices
were immediately examined by a confocal microscope
at corresponding excitation wavelength (LSM710, Carl
Zeiss, Germany). At the same time, the slices were stained
with Rab mAb to CD34 antibody (1:100) and Alexa
Fluor 594-conjugated Affinipure Donkey Anti-Rabbit
IgG secondary antibody with a procedure established
previously. Then the distribution was determined by
a confocal microscope above at corresponding excitation
wavelength.

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP was designed
to overcome the limitations of current NPs such as low
targeting efficiency and poor penetration ability. Based on
the enhanced accumulation of angiopep-2 mediated active
targeting and size-reduction of enhanced penetration
efficacy, Angio-DOX-DGL-GNP significantly inhibited
tumor growth and provided a promising nanoplatform for
TNBC treatment.

In vivo therapy studies
The therapy studies were conducted in 4T1 tumor
models. Briefly, 4T1 cells (5 × 105) were injected into
the right flank of BALB/c mice (20 ± 2). BALB/c mice
bearing 4T1 tumor were randomly divided into six
groups (n = 6) and treated with different formulations at
a dose of 5 mg/kg of DOX and saline via intravenously
injection at an interval of 2 days for 4 times, respectively.
The tumor size and body weight of mice were recorded
at the meantime and the tumor volume was calculated
using the formula: Tumor volume = (width2/length)/2. At
the end of the experiment, all the mice were killed and
the main organs were isolated. Finally the tumors were
imaged and weighed. For HE staining, formalin-fixed
tissues were embedded in paraffin blocks and observed
by optical microscope (Axiovert 40 CFL, Carl Zeiss,
Germany).
