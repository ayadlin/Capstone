Abstract
We use hepatic cellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common human cancers, as a model to delineate
the landscape of promoter hypomethylation in cancer. Using a combination of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and hybridization with comprehensive promoter arrays, we have identified approximately 3,700
promoters that are hypomethylated in tumor samples. The hypomethylated promoters appeared in clusters
across the genome suggesting that a high-level organization underlies the epigenomic changes in cancer. In
normal liver, most hypomethylated promoters showed an intermediate level of methylation and expression,
however, high-CpG dense promoters showed the most profound increase in gene expression. The demethylated
genes are mainly involved in cell growth, cell adhesion and communication, signal transduction, mobility, and
invasion; functions that are essential for cancer progression and metastasis. The DNA methylation inhibitor, 5aza-20 -deoxycytidine, activated several of the genes that are demethylated and induced in tumors, supporting a
causal role for demethylation in activation of these genes. Previous studies suggested that MBD2 was involved in
demethylation of specific human breast and prostate cancer genes. Whereas MBD2 depletion in normal liver
cells had little or no effect, we found that its depletion in human HCC and adenocarcinoma cells resulted in
suppression of cell growth, anchorage-independent growth and invasiveness as well as an increase in promoter
methylation and silencing of several of the genes that are hypomethylated in tumors. Taken together, the findings
define the potential functional role of hypomethylation in cancer. Cancer Res; 71(17); 5891–903. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
DNA methylation is a chemical modification of DNA involved
in gene expression programming (1). One of the hallmarks of
cancer is aberrant DNA methylation. Three types of aberration
in the DNA methylation machinery occur in cancer: hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, aberrant expression of
DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and other DNMTs, as well as
hypomethylation of unique genes and repetitive sequences (2–
4). The role of increased DNMT1 activity and DNA hypermethylation in cancer has been well studied and has been the focus of
anticancer therapeutics. Studies have shown that overexpression of DNMT1 and deregulation of the proper cell-cycle–

coordinated expression of DNMT1 cause cellular transformation (5). On the other hand, knockdown of dnmt1 by antisense
oligonucleotide inhibitors blocks cancer growth (6), and knockout of dnmt1 protects mice from colorectal cancer (7). The main
mechanism of action of DNMT1 inhibitors was believed to be
inhibition of DNA methylation and activation of tumor suppressor genes that were silenced by DNA methylation (8),
although inhibition of DNMT1 could also induce tumor suppressor genes such as p21 by a DNA methylation independent
mechanism (9). The first DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (AC) (Vidaza; ref. 10) was recently approved by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (11). Vidaza is now considered a new and
promising approach to cancer therapy.
DNA demethylation in cancer is extensive and therefore was
believed to mainly involve hypomethylation of repetitive
sequences. Though its role in genes encoding proteins was
unclear and the main focus in the field in the last 2 decades has
been on the role of hypermethylation of tumor suppressor
genes, a few screens for hypomethylated genes in different
cancers have revealed several that were characteristically
unmethylated in different types of cancer (12, 13). DNMT
inhibitors cause DNA demethylation leading to induction of
prometastatic genes such as HEPARANASE (14) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU; ref. 15) and metastasis suggesting a possible role for hypomethylation in cancer
metastasis. We previously proposed that the methylated

DNA-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) was required for
expression and demethylation of PLAU and another prometastatic gene MMP2 (15, 16). MBD2 depletion by antisense
oligonucleotides resulted in silencing of these genes and inhibition of invasiveness and metastasis of breast and prostate
cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and PC3, in nude mice (15).
These data suggest that demethylation of protein-coding
genes might play an important role in cancer progression
and metastasis. To understand the potential role of hypomethylation in cancer it is essential to delineate the landscape of
hypomethylation in cancer samples. We therefore focused here
on one of the most common cancers, hepatic cellular carcinoma
(HCC) and examined the landscape of promoter demethylation
in tumor samples. We mapped the hypomethylated sites to the
genome to determine how they are distributed across the
genome. We defined the functional pathways that are subject
to hypomethylation in liver cancer using GO and KEGG databases. To determine how demethylation in liver cancer compares to demethylation in other cancers, we collected and
analyzed published methylation profiles of other cancers.
To investigate the role of hypomethylation and its mechanisms in cancer, we used HCC cell line HepG2 and liver
adenocarcinoma cell line SkHep1 as model systems. In particular, we knocked down MBD2 in these cell lines and measured the resulting effect on cell growth, cell invasiveness, and
expression of genes shown to be hypomethylated in liver
cancer and in primary human liver cells overexpressing
MBD2. At each step, we show that our results are consistent
with the hypothesis that hypomethylation in liver cancer
targets promoters of specific genes encoding functional pathways required for cell growth and invasion and that partial
reversal of this process results in reversal of tumor growth and
invasiveness in liver cancer cells but not in normal liver cells.

patients provided written informed consent, and the Ethics
Committee from Chinese National Human Genome Center at
Shanghai approved all aspects of this study.
Cell culture and transfection with siRNA directed to
MBD2
Human HCC HepG2 cells and adenocarcinoma SkHep1
cells were authenticated by DNA profile using the short
tandem repeat, cytogenetic analysis (G-banding, FISH), flow
cytometry, and immunocytochemistry and obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (HB8065 and HTB52,
respectively, ATCC) in December 2007 and December 2008,
respectively. Human untransformed hepatocytes (normal
hepatocytes, NorHep) derived from adult human liver were
authenticated by tests for cytochrome P450 and albumin and
obtained from Celprogen (33003-02) in September 2007, June
2009 and January 2011. After resuscitation of the received
frozen cell ampule, the third, fourth, and fifth passage of cells
was frozen, and only these frozen verified stocks were used for
further experimental studies up to the twelfth passage (1–2
months). All cell lines were routinely verified by morphology
and growth rate. HepG2 and SkHep1 cells were maintained in
MEM medium (Gibco, Invitrogen, Life Technologies) supplemented with 2 mmol/L glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), 10% FBS
(Gibco), 1 U/mL penicillin and 1 mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco).
NorHep cells were maintained in human hepatocyte cell
culture complete medium (Celprogen). Cells were grown
and transfected with siRNA as described in Supplementary
Methods. The following siRNAs (50 nmol/L final concentration,
Dharmacon, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used in this study:
control siRNA (siCtrl, antisense strand: 50 -UCGCCUAGGCUGCCAAGGCUU-30 ) and human MBD2 siRNA (siMBD2,
antisense strand: 50 -UUACUAGGCAUCAUCUUUCUU-30 ).

real-time PCR (qPCR) reactions were done as described in
Supplementary Methods using primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. The proteins were immunoblotted with an antiMBD2 antibody at 1:1,000 dilution, followed by a secondary
anti-rabbit IgG antibody at 1:4,000 dilution. The anti-MBD2
antibody was developed in our laboratory and is specific for 2
MBD2 isoforms, A and B. The membranes were blotted with
an anti-b–actin antibody as loading control (Sigma–Aldrich).
See Supplementary Methods for further details.
Pyrosequencing
Bisulfite conversion was done as previously described (17).
Specific bisulfite converted promoter sequences were amplified
with HotStar Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) using biotinylated
primers listed in Supplementary Table S2. The biotinylated
DNA strands were pyrosequenced in the PyroMark Q24
instrument (Biotage, Qiagen) as previously described (18). Data
were analyzed using PyroMark Q24 software.
Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and promoter
methylation microarrays
Purified DNA from cancerous samples and normal adjacent
samples as well as HepG2 and NorHep cells was enriched for
methylated DNA using the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) protocol developed by Cedar's group (19). The
labeled input and bound DNA samples were hybridized to a
custom designed 244 K promoter tiling array (Agilent Technologies) that contained probes covering all transcription
start sites at intervals from 800 bp upstream to 200 bp
downstream of all genes described in Ensembl (version 44)
and within 250 bp of approximately 400 microRNAs from
miRBase, all at 100 bp-spacing. The array covered 36,957
transcription start sites corresponding to 18,468 genes. All
the steps of hybridization, washing, and scanning were done
following the Agilent protocol for ChIP-on-chip analysis. The
methods for analysis of promoter methylation microarray are
included in Supplementary Methods.
Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation
Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qChIP) was
done as previously described (ref. 20; see Supplementary
Methods for further details). ChIP DNA was used as a template
for qPCR. A total of 25 ng of bound and input DNA was used as
starting material in all conditions. Level of MBD2 binding was
expressed as (Bound-IgG)/Input. Primers used for ChIP validation are depicted in Supplementary Table S3.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis for pyrosequencing and qPCR data was
done using unpaired and paired t tests. Each value represents
the mean  SD of 2 or 3 independent experiments. The results
were considered statistically significant when P < 0.05.

Results
Promoter DNA hypomethylation is widespread in HCC
It has been well established that global demethylation of
repetitive sequences such as Line1 repeats is a hallmark of

several cancers including HCC (21). It was generally assumed
that DNA demethylation in cancer occurs mainly in repetitive,
CpG-sparse regions of the genome (22) in contrast to DNA
methylation that targets CpG-rich islands in promoters and
first exons (23). To delineate the scope and landscape of
differential DNA methylation between cancer and adjacent
normal tissue in the promoters of genes, we subjected DNA
prepared from 11 patients with HCC at low to high differentiation stage and a HCC cell line HepG2 and a nontransformed primary human liver cell line (NorHep) to MeDIP and
hybridization to a custom-designed 244 K promoter tiling
array. Hierarchical clustering of the 500 of the most variable
promoters in this data set separates cancer from adjacent
normal samples (Fig. 1A). Contrary to the usual emphasis
on gene promoter hypermethylation in cancer, there are
approximately an equal number of promoters that are hypermethylated (3,517 corresponding to 1,894 genes) and hypomethylated (3,689 corresponding to 1,974 genes). Surprisingly,
the NorHep cell line is included in the clustering with the
tumor samples and the HepG2 HCC cell line (Fig. 1A). This
suggests that a significant fraction of the gene promoters
whose DNA methylation levels classifies tumors also undergo
methylation changes when nontransformed cells are placed in
culture media. Nevertheless, a careful examination of the
differences in DNA methylation between normal cultured
hepatocytes and HepG2 HCC cells identifies approximately
3,800 differentially methylated promoters that distinguish
NorHep from HepG2 cells. Because many of these gene
promoters also differentiate liver tumor tissue from adjacent
normal tissue, methylation changes in these promoters are
likely critical for the state of cellular transformation and cell
invasiveness as will be elaborated below. The array data was
validated by pyrosequencing (methylation arrays) and qPCR
(expression arrays) of several genes as described in Supplementary Methods (Supplementary Fig. S1). We ruled out the
possibility that the demethylation observed in our pyrosequencing assays reflects either mutations of C to T or deletions (see Supplementary Results for further details,
Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S4).
Methylation profiles were compared with gene expression
profiles for the same patients. Overall, genes that are highly
expressed in tumors have lower promoter methylation in both
normal liver tissue (Fig. 1C) and HCC (Fig. 1D) suggesting that
there is an inverse correlation between promoter DNA methylation and gene expression in both normal and cancer tissues.
Opposed to this overall correlation is a significant fraction
of lowly expressed genes with lower promoter methylation
levels and a few highly expressed genes with high promoter
methylation.
Hypomethylation targets functional pathways critical
for cancer growth and metastasis
From our gene expression and promoter methylation profiles, we identified 230 genes whose promoters contain
reduced methylation levels and whose expression levels are
elevated in cancer and 322 genes whose promoters contain
increased methylation levels and whose expression levels are
reduced in cancer (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Table S5). For

convenience, we call the first set of genes "epigenetically
induced" and the latter set "epigenetically suppressed." These
results support the hypothesis that promoter hypomethylation might play as important role in modulating gene expression levels in cancer as promoter hypermethylation.
Functional analysis reveals that the epigenetically induced
genes are enriched in pathways which were reported before to
drive cellular transformation, cancer growth, angiogenesis,
and cancer metastasis (Supplementary Fig. S3A). It may
suggest that these genes are important for liver cancer development and progression, however, this needs to be confirmed
in future molecular studies. Further details about these pathways are included in Supplementary Results. In contrast,

5894

epigenetically suppressed genes are enriched in signaling
cascades that are well known to be suppressed/attenuated
in cancer. Most of the identified pathways are responsible for
regulation of proliferation, cell-cycle progression, apoptosis
and adhesion, all which are essential for normal cell function
and integration (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
In general, the epigenetically induced genes are enriched in
biological processes that are known to be critical for tumor
progression, survival and motility, differentiation, transcription regulation, and signal transduction (Table 2). Many of the
epigenetically induced genes in these critical processes are
known to play a role in cancer while at least 20 of these genes,
to our knowledge, play unknown roles (Tables 2 and 3,

Supplementary Results). These 20 genes are enriched in
biological processes such as histone binding, positively regulating MAPK pathway, methyltransferase activity, and involvement in base-excision repair, suggesting that these new
candidates play a role in liver cancer and are regulated by
epigenetic mechanisms.
To determine causal relationship between promoter hypomethylation and activation of these genes in HCC, we determined whether the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-20 deoxycytidine (5-azaCdR) would induce these genes in a primary hepatocyte (NorHep) cell culture. We examined by qPCR
the expression of 84 genes following 5-azaCdR treatment of
NorHep including 65 with high CpG-dense promoters (see
Supplementary Results for a rationale for choosing these
genes). Seventy-one of the 84 examined genes were induced
upon treatment with 5-azaCdR at 1.0 mmol/L concentration for
either 5 or 20 days (Supplementary Table S6, Supplementary
Fig. S4B). As expected, 5-azaCdR treatment of NorHep cells led
to global hypomethylation (Supplementary Fig. S4A) and a

decrease in promoter methylation of MMP2, NUPR1, PLAU, and
S100A5 genes (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Using microarray data
for each patient, we also found a correlation between promoter
hypomethylation and gene induction for 230 genes epigenetically induced in HCC samples (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P 
0.005) indicating that promoter hypomethylation does have
impact on the increase in gene expression (see Supplementary
Results for details and Supplementary Fig. S4D).
Properties of genes demethylated in liver cancer
We first identified promoters that are hypomethylated in
HCC compared with normal liver cells. We then compared the
state of methylation of all genes that are targeted for hypomethylation in HCC with the state of methylation of these
genes in several normal tissues (24). The heatmap in Figure 2A
reveals that the promoters that are hypomethylated in HCC
exhibit tissue-specific methylation patterns in normal tissues
that is consistent with a role for these genes in cellular
differentiation.

DNA Hypomethylation in Liver Cancer

It has been previously suggested that while hypermethylation in cancer targets CpG island-containing promoters,
hypomethylation occurs mainly in sparsely distributed CpGs
(22, 23). We therefore tested whether there was any discrimination for CpG sparse sequences among the hypomethylated
promoters. All promoters were divided into 3 CpG density
groups, high (HCP, 37%), intermediate (ICP, 25%), and low
(LCP, 38%; Fig. 2B; ref. 25). Our analysis indicates that hypomethylation targets promoters with a wide range of CpG
densities, which is consistent with the broad scope of DNA
hypomethylation seen in liver cancer (Fig. 2C). As expected the
hypomethylated promoters with high CpG density are also
highly expressed in tumors (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P ¼ 1.05
 109; Fig. 2D), and hypomethylation of these promoters in
tumors is correlated with the most profound increase in gene
expression in HCC as compared with normal liver (average
expression differences are > 0, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P ¼
1.37  105; Fig. 2E). We therefore focused on this gene set for
further analysis. Our data suggest that CpG rich promoters
that are hypomethylated in HCC are methylated at an intermediate level in normal liver (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P ¼
1.32  1038) (Fig. 2F, Supplementary Fig. S5), although there
are exceptions (see Supplementary Table S7 for a list of genes
that are heavily methylated in normal liver and hypomethylated in HCC).
Early reports of changes in DNA methylation in cancer
focused on extreme on-off changes. Indeed, there is a small
fraction of gene promoters demethylated in HCC that have
little or no expression in normal liver and are highly expressed
having their promoters hypomethylated in tumors (Supplementary Fig. S5, right panel). This group includes genes that
are overexpressed in many types of human malignancies such
as members of MAGE and GAGE families, metalloproteinases
and amino acid transporters (26). However, the global picture
emerging from our study is that hypomethylation in HCC
takes place in promoters that, in normal tissue, are already
partially hypomethylated (P  5.8  106; Wilcoxon rank-sum
test that these promoters have lower than average methylation levels) and whose corresponding genes are quite active (P
 4.2  105; Wilcoxon rank-sum test that these genes have
higher than average expression). This suggests that overall
induction of gene expression and hypomethylation in liver
cancer modulates an existing program rather than switching
on genes by promoter demethylation. On the other hand, we
cannot rule out the possibility that "normal" liver tissue from
HCC patients consists of heterogeneous cell populations
comprising normal and cancer cells which may affect the
results.
A common demethylation signature in liver, breast, and
ovarian cancer
As the hypomethylation events in liver cancer affect basic
pathways in cancer growth (Supplementary Fig. S3A), we
reasoned that several of these events occur in other cancer
types as well. To test this, we obtained published tumor and
normal methylation profiles for breast, ovarian, and colorectal
cancers (27, 28) and computed the methylation differences
(tumor over normal) in the 500 most demethylated gene

www.aacrjournals.org

promoters in liver cancer. As expected, although these differences are mainly tumor type specific, several genes are hypomethylated in all selected cancers (Fig. 3A and B). In further
analysis, we omitted colorectal cancer since its methylation
profiles covered fewer promoters, and we identified 42 gene
promoters that are hypomethylated in liver, ovarian, and
breast cancers (Supplementary Table S8). For further details
about genes that are hypomethylated in different types of
cancer see Supplementary Results. Interestingly, although the
identity of a specific member of a gene family is cell-type
specific, we found that the involvement of a few gene families
such as MAGE, SNORA, KIAA, is common to several cancers.
We suspect that this might be a general rule for other gene
families, pathways, and processes.
Clustering of DNA hypomethylation in liver cancer
Having shown that hypomethylated promoters in liver
cancer share several common functions relevant to cancer,
we then asked whether the distribution of these hypomethylated promoters in the genome exhibited evidence of some
higher-level organization. First, we examined the distribution
of hypomethylated promoters at the chromosomal level. We
noticed overrepresentation of hypomethylated promoters in 7
chromosomes as shown in Figure 3C (Wilcoxon rank-sum test,
P ¼ 8.25  105). Second, we asked whether the hypomethylated promoters are randomly distributed or whether they
form clusters. Several such clusters are identified in Figure 3C.
Clustering of differentially hypermethylated promoters in
cancer was previously reported in a study comparing breast
cancer to normal samples; these clusters were frequently
found at gene family clusters (29). Several of our clusters
are similarly found at gene family clusters that were previously
shown to be important in cancer. Further details about
identified hypomethylated clusters are included in Supplementary Results. Beyond local clusters of genes, differential
promoter methylation shows evidence of long-range dependencies; in fact, these dependencies are statistically significant
(P < 0.05) up to a distance of 15 Mbp (Fig. 3D). This indicates a
highly large-scale organization of DNA hypomethylation in
HCC.
Invasiveness of liver cancer is dependent on MBD2
expression
To test whether epigenetic regulators could play a causal
role in HCC through induction of the genes delineated in this
study, we first examined whether the expression of any of the
known epigenetic proteins is altered in the tumor samples.
Among genes implicated in regulation of DNA methylation,
MBD2 showed the highest induction of expression in the HCC
samples (Fig. 4A). MBD2 was previously shown to be involved
in the activation and demethylation of PLAU and MMP2 in
breast and prostate cancer cell lines (15, 16). Interestingly, our
results indicate that MBD2 expression correlates with the
extent of hypomethylation in the individual HCC samples
(Fig. 4A, right panel). Although we cannot determine causality
in human clinical samples, we can determine whether or not
MBD2 plays a causal role in cellular transformation and
invasiveness using a human liver cell culture model. We

showing the differential state of methylation (cancer-normal) in liver, ovarian, breast, and colorectal cancers of a list of promoters that are hypomethylated in
HCC. The order of genes in the heatmap is shown in Supplementary Table S12. B, Venn diagram showing overlap between the hypomethylated gene
promoters in 3 human cancers listed in Supplementary Table S9. C, chromosomal views of the methylation difference between HCC and normal liver.
Chromosomes with extensive hypomethylation in HCC are shown. Microarray data were visualized in the UCSC genome browser (44). The tracks show
differences in mean methylation between 11 HCC samples and normal liver samples. Downward peaks (below the 0 line) represent lower mean methylation in
HCC versus normal liver. The horizontal line represents the 0 point where there is no difference in methylation between the groups. Clusters of gene families
that are hypomethylated in cancer are indicated for chromosomes 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, X. Other chromosomes did not exhibit long range DNA
hypomethylation. D, differential methylation in cancer correlates up to megabase distances along the genome. By examining methylation differences in all 500
kbp regions a given length apart, we showed that adjacent differential methylation is correlated up to distances of several mega-base pairs. The pink rectangle
represents the 95% CI of the background distribution created by randomly permuted probes.

therefore depleted MBD2 in the liver cancer cell lines, HepG2
and SkHep1, as well as nontransformed normal liver cells
(NorHep) to compare the effects of MBD2 depletion in cancer
cells to that in normal cells. Depletion of MBD2 expression in
the liver cancer cell lines (Fig. 4B and C, mRNA; protein) was
followed by inhibition of the rate of cancer cell growth
(Fig. 4D), anchorage-independent growth and cell invasiveness (Fig. 4E and F).
Reduction of MBD2 in SkHep1 cells dramatically reduced
cell viability prompting us to examine whether MBD2 depletion triggered apoptosis. We observed a 3-fold increase in
apoptosis rate in HepG2 and SkHep1 cells on day 9, and when
SkHep1 cells were split during the experiment the rate of
apoptosis increased 8-fold on day 6 (Fig. 4G). A possible

5898

Cancer Res; 71(17) September 1, 2011

explanation for this heightened rate of apoptosis is the fact
that MBD2 depletion resulted in downregulation of an apoptosis inhibitor, BIRC3, by 80% and 65% in HepG2 and SkHep1,
respectively (Fig. 4G). In untreated SkHep1 cells compared
with NorHep, BIRC3 is 10-fold more expressed (Fig. 4G), a fact
that might be related to the higher sensitivity of this cell line to
MBD2 depletion.
Contrary to cancer cells, NorHep cells that were treated
with siMBD2 proliferated at almost the same rate as control
cells and there was no significant effect on invasiveness or
anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 4D, E, and F). The basis
for this difference is probably a consequence of the fact that
there are 2 known isoforms of MBD2, MBD2A initiating at an
upstream ATG and MBD2B initiating at a downstream ATG.

DNA Hypomethylation in Liver Cancer

Figure 4. Regulation of cancer growth and invasion by MBD2 in HCC cell lines; selectivity for cancer versus nontransformed cells. A, expression of
genes that are implicated in regulation of epigenetic modifications in liver cancer samples compared with matched adjacent normal tissues. A chart in the right
panel shows a correlation between MBD2 upregulation and average level of hypomethylation in HCC patients. MBD2 expression is higher in HCC samples
that show more profound DNA hypomethylation. The x-axis shows the average level of hypomethylation in every patient that represents the mean
hypomethylation of 9 genes: AKR1B10, CENPH, MMP2, MMP9, MMP12, NUPR1, PAGE4, PLAU, and S100A5 as determined by pyrosequencing. The mean
hypomethylation in each gene was calculated by dividing the percentage of methylation in normal adjacent tissue by the percentage of methylation in matched
cancer sample. The y-axis shows a fold change in MBD2 expression in every patient that was calculated by dividing MBD2 expression in cancer sample by
MBD2 expression in normal adjacent tissue based on array data. B and C, MBD2 expression quantified by qPCR (B) after first (I), second (II), and

split and after third transfection (on day 9) when cells were cultured without passaging. H, expression of a set of genes in NorHep after MBD2 knockdown.
Contrary to cancer cells, MBD2 depletion in NorHep does not suppress the selected genes. All results represent mean  SD of 2 or 3 independent

As shown in Figure 4C, the cancer cell lines selectively express
higher levels of the B isoform while the normal liver cell
expresses the A isoform predominantly. Our data suggest that
a similar difference exists at the mRNA level, that the mRNA
encoding isoform B is elevated in the cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S6A). In accordance with this hypothesis,
specific knockdown of the MBD2A isoform in HepG2 cells
did not affect cell growth and invasive capacities (Supplementary Fig. S6B–E). Furthermore, because the MBD2B
isoform was previously reported by us to act as a cytosine
DNA demethylase (30), the MBD2B isoform may be responsible for the cancer-specific effects of MBD2 depletion. However, further experiments are required to investigate this
hypothesis.
Given that MBD2 depletion in cancer cells reduces cell
growth and invasiveness, we then asked whether or not
MBD2 could play a role in inducing the epigenetically
induced genes in HCC. Among the 230 genes epigenetically
induced in HCC and another 188 genes that were either
hypomethylated or induced in both HCC and HepG2, we
found 82 genes that were implicated in pathways and
biological processes important for regulation of cellular
transformation and migration (Supplementary Table S9).
Moreover, an experimental upregulation of many of these
genes has reportedly led to increased growth and aggressiveness. Of these selected genes, we identified 15 genes that
were suppressed after MBD2 knockdown in HepG2 and/or
SkHep1 cells (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S7B). Most of these
15 genes are overexpressed in HepG2 and/or SkHep1
untreated cells compared with NorHep (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S7A). Consistent with the observation that MBD2
depletion had little effect on NorHep cell growth and invasion, depletion of MBD2 in NorHep cells did not silence (or
induction in the case of S100A5) the genes that were suppressed in the cancer cell lines by siMBD2 (Fig. 4H).
MBD2 was previously shown to act as both a transcriptional
repressor and an activator of gene expression, and several
studies from our lab suggested that it promoted demethylation of its target-activated genes (31). MBD2 might therefore
regulate these hypomethylated genes in liver cancer either by
interacting with the chromatin at the gene regulatory
sequences to activate them or indirectly by suppressing genes
that in turn negatively regulate the genes that we found
epigenetically induced in liver cancer. We therefore asked if
MBD2 binds the promoter regions of 4 of the genes (MMP2,
PLAU, S100A5, and NUPR1), whether depletion of MBD2
reduces any such binding, and whether MBD2 depletion
changes their methylation status as tested by pyrosequencing
(Fig. 5). Our data show that MBD2 binds these promoters, that
MBD2 depletion results in reduced MBD2 binding (Fig. 5), and
that MBD2 depletion results in 2 to 5-fold increase in methylation at certain CpG sites (see Figure 5B–E for the exact
position of the CpGs that change). We further showed that
MBD2 upregulation in NorHep cells leads to induction and
hypomethylation of several of these genes (see Supplementary
Methods and Supplementary Results for details, Supplementary Fig. S8). These studies support the hypothesis that MBD2
regulates several of the genes, that are activated and hypo-

methylated in HCC and liver cancer cell lines, and therefore
likely conducts a similar role in liver cancer.

Discussion
The hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoters of tumor
suppressor genes has been the focus of attention in the study of
the role of DNA methylation in cancer. This focus has guided as
well therapeutic approaches to DNA methylation in cancer.
Unsurprisingly, the first DNA methylation drug that the FDA
approved for cancer therapy was 5-aza-cytidine, a DNA methylation inhibitor (11). Although it has been known for more than
2 decades that cancer cell DNA is globally hypomethylated
when compared with normal DNA, DNA hypomethylation of
promoters in cancer has not attracted much attention. It was
generally believed that areas with sparsely distributed CpGs
such as repetitive sequences and satellite DNA are hypomethylated (22). It was therefore suspected that global hypomethylation is mainly involved in structural-nuclear functions such as
chromosomal stability but not in promoter function in contrast to hypermethylation. Indeed there is pharmacological and
genetic evidence that chromosomal and genomic stability
might be compromised by global hypomethylation (32, 33).
The immunodeficiency, centromeric region instability, and
facial anomalies syndrome (ICF) is a genetic disease caused
by DNMT3B mutation resulting in hypomethylation of pericentromeric DNA and chromosomal instability (34).
There have been periodic reports of promoters that were
hypomethylated in cancer (35, 36); however, it is generally
accepted that the weight of the balance is tilting toward
hypermethylation of tumor controlling genes. Our study
shows that promoter hypomethylation is as broadly distributed as promoter hypermethylation suggesting a central role
for promoter hypomethylation in cancer growth and metastasis. A bioinformatic analysis of promoter hypomethylation
suggests that it targets some of the cardinal pathways involved
in cancer growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S3A, Table 2). The functional pathways affected by
hypomethylation are fundamentally different from those
affected by hypermethylation (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Owing to the fact that DNA methylation is known almost
exclusively as a repressive regulatory mark, it is perhaps
unexpected to find that only a fraction of the genes whose
promoters were hypomethylated show significant increase in
gene expression. Hypomethylation might be conditioning
these genes to be expressed only in response to specific
triggers. A good example of conditioning of genes by epigenetic programming is the programming of responsivity to
glucocorticoid hormones by DNA demethylation in glucocorticoid responsive genes (37).
Changes in DNA methylation of CpG rich promoters in
cancer involve both hypermethylation as is widely accepted
and hypomethylation (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, in contrast to the
common "stereotype," the genes that are hypomethylated in
HCC exhibit a broad range of methylation levels in normal
liver. The global picture emerging from our study is that
hypomethylation in HCC occurs in genes that are characterized by an intermediate level of methylation and expression in

normal liver (Supplementary Fig. S5). Nevertheless, as previously shown there is a small subset of genes that undergo
dramatic off-on changes in methylation in HCC (see Supplementary Fig. S5, right panel).
Hypomethylation is organized not only at the functional
level through hypomethylation of several members of specific
functional gene pathways but also at the structural level by
clustering of hypomethylated gene promoters in regions and

chromosomes (Fig. 3C). The clustering of hypomethylated
promoters in gene families is consistent with the hypothesis
that there is a yet unknown common mechanism that targets
members of the same family to become hypomethylated in
liver cancer perhaps through a common cis-acting element. It
is unclear what mechanism is responsible for coordinated
hypomethylation of multiple promoters from different gene
families residing in regions that span up to 15 MB of sequence

(Fig. 3D). Large-scale functional relationships in gene clusters
such as the beta globin gene cluster were studied for decades
(38) and it is known that large-scale regions such as imprinted
genes clusters are regulated by long-acting cis-acting elements
such as CTCF (39, 40). Although the mechanisms are yet to be
elucidated, the genome-scale response seen here suggests an
organized response rather than multistep selection of random
events. Understanding the fundamental players coordinating
such responses is obviously critical for identifying targets for
cancer therapeutics.
The apparent functional and spatial organization of the
demethylation events suggests a common factor responsible
for hypomethylation and activation of these genes. We have
previously shown that MBD2 plays a causal role in the activity
and state of methylation of PLAU and MMP2 in breast and
prostate cancer cell lines (15, 16). We took advantage of
human liver cancer cell lines as experimental models for
testing the hypothesis that several of the genes that are
activated and hypomethylated in HCC in the patients are
regulated by MBD2. Although MBD2 has been shown to serve
as a repressor of methylated genes in several instances (41),
our data (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S7B, Supplementary
Fig. S8) suggest that it acts as an activator of critical genes
that are hypomethylated in liver cancer. MBD2 was previously
shown to associate with transcriptional activation complexes.
It is interesting to note that MeCP2, the prototype of methylated DNA binding proteins (42) and the prime repressor of
methylated promoters, was recently shown to also act as an
activator of gene expression and the switch between repressor
and activator was found to be a serine phosphorylation event
(43). We previously suggested that MBD2B is associated with
DNA demethylase activity, which could explain the involvement of MBD2 in demethylation and activation of these genes.
Our pyrosequencing data (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S8)
suggest indeed that several CpG sites in several gene promoters have their methylation levels changed upon MBD2 depletion and upon MBD2 overexpression. However, we cannot rule
out that observed CpG demethylation may be an indirect
consequence of the transcriptional activation of promoters by
MBD2. Importantly, depletion of MBD2 not only silences the
expression of at least 15 of the genes induced in liver cancer
(Supplementary Fig. S7A and B), but it also blocks the transformation and invasive properties of the cell (Fig. 4D, E, and F).
It also increases apoptosis in the cancer cells but not in
nontransformed liver cells (Fig. 4G). The effects of MBD2
depletion in liver cancer cells could be explained by the fact
that depletion of MBD2 silences genes known to be involved in
metastasis and apoptosis (Fig. 4G and Fig. 5A). Taken
together, the data provide support not only for the involvement of MBD2 as a master regulator of some of the genes

activated in liver cancer but also for the hypothesis that
hypomethylation and activation of this set of genes play a
causal role in cancer, particularly in cancer metastasis.
A remarkable observation is the exquisite specificity of the
effect of MBD2 depletion on cancer cells. One possible explanation is that MBD2 depletion results in silencing of genes that are
activated in cancer. Because these genes are silenced already in
normal cells, MBD2 depletion would have no impact on these
genes. A possible explanation for the fact that this set of genes is
hypomethylated in HCC but not in normal liver cells is that
cancer cells express a specific isoform MBD2B which is abundant in HCC. It is clear from our results that the putative targets
of MBD2A are not involved in driving cancer cell growth and
invasive capacities since MBD2A depletion does not result in
significant changes in growth rate, anchorage-independent
growth and invasiveness in cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S6).
There are several implications of these studies for cancer
therapeutics. First, our data raise the concern that demethylating drugs that are currently being used in cancer therapy
might have adverse effects due to activation of oncogenes and
prometastatic genes. Second, our data suggest that targeting
the DNA demethylation machinery might serve as a new
approach to liver cancer and cancer therapy. Third, MBD2
inhibition has potential as an anticancer therapeutic strategy
targeting some of the cardinal processes that lead to activation and demethylation of these genes in liver cancer. The
exquisite specificity of MBD2 depletion to cancer cells as far as
both gene expression and cell biology effects are concerned
supports the idea that MBD2 depletion could serve as a
strategy for specifically silencing critical genes in liver cancer
and stopping cancer growth and metastasis.
