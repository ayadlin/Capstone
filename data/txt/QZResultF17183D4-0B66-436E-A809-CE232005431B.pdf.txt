Abstract
The Bcl-2 family of proteins consists of both antiapoptotic and
proapoptotic factors, which share sequence homology within
conserved regions known as Bcl-2 homology domains.
Interactions between Bcl-2 family members, as well as with
other proteins, regulate apoptosis through control of mitochondrial membrane permeability and release of cytochrome c.
Here we identify a novel regulator of apoptosis that lacks
Bcl-2 homology domains but acts by binding Bcl-2 and
modulating its antiapoptotic activity. To identify regulators
of apoptosis, we performed expression profiling in human
primary fibroblasts treated with tumor necrosis factor-A
(TNF-A), a potent inflammatory cytokine that can regulate
apoptosis and functions, at least in part, by inducing
expression of specific genes through NF-KB. We found that
the gene undergoing maximal transcriptional induction
following TNF-A treatment was G0-G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2),
the activation of which also required NF-KB. We show that
G0S2 encodes a mitochondrial protein that specifically
interacts with Bcl-2 and promotes apoptosis by preventing
the formation of protective Bcl-2/Bax heterodimers. We
further show that ectopic expression of G0S2 induces
apoptosis in diverse human cancer cell lines in which
endogenous G0S2 is normally epigenetically silenced. Our
results reveal a novel proapoptotic factor that is induced by
TNF-A through NF-KB and that interacts with and antagonizes
Bcl-2. [Cancer Res 2009;69(17):6782–9]

Introduction
Apoptosis has been implicated in a variety of biological processes including normal development, tissue homeostasis, and
defense against pathogens (reviewed in ref. 1). Over the past
decade, interest in apoptotic mechanisms has been greatly stimulated by the discovery that deregulation of cell death contributes
to several human pathologies including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and degenerative diseases (reviewed in refs. 2, 3).
A key component of the apoptotic machinery is a proteolytic
system involving a family of cysteine proteases called caspases.

Two pathways leading to caspase activation have been characterized: the extrinsic pathway, which involves the so-called "death
receptors," and the intrinsic pathway, which involves the release
of proapoptotic proteins from the mitochondria. Commitment
to apoptosis is governed by proteins of the Bcl-2 family, which
are defined by the inclusion of one or more Bcl-2 homology
domains (reviewed in refs. 2, 4). The BH3 domain, for example, is
a potent "death domain" that is critical for heterodimerization
with other Bcl-2 family proteins. The Bcl-2 family includes both
antiapoptotic members, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and proapoptotic members that either resemble Bcl-2 (e.g., Bax and Bak) or
bear only the BH3 interaction domain (e.g., Bid, Bad, Bim, Noxa,
and Puma). Although the precise mechanism by which Bcl-2 proteins function is under investigation, it is clear that they regulate
the release of proteins from the mitochondria that induce apoptosis.
A well-studied example of the extrinsic pathway is that induced
by the inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a;
reviewed in ref. 5). TNF-a promotes apoptosis through binding
to its cell surface receptor, TNFR1, leading to the activation of
downstream signal transduction pathways. Signaling through
TNFR1 elicits rapid activation of two major heterodimeric transcription factors, activator protein-1 (also called c-Jun) and NF-nB.
NF-nB can either inhibit or induce apoptosis depending on
cell type, extent of NF-nB activation, and nature of the apoptotic
signal (reviewed in ref. 6). For example, NF-nB has been shown
to antagonize TNF-a–induced apoptosis by activating survival
factors such as cellular FLICE inhibitory protein, cellular inhibitors
of apoptosis cIAP1 and cIAP2, and TNFR-associated factors TRAF1
and TRAF2. NF-nB also up-regulates several antiapoptotic Bcl-2
family members and inhibits the intrinsic mitochondrial-dependent
apoptosis pathway following DNA damage. By contrast, NF-nB can
promote cell death, for example, when cells are cultured under
conditions of serum withdrawal or treated with UV irradiation.
Consistent with the ability of NF-nB to exhibit both proapoptotic
and antiapoptotic activities, NF-nB does not always function as an
oncogene and in some cases can act as a tumor suppressor (6).
Based on these considerations, we hypothesized the existence of
novel, NF-nB–dependent, TNF-a–inducible modulators of apoptosis. Here we perform expression profiling in human primary
fibroblasts to identify new TNF-a target genes that encode
regulators of apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Expression profiling. Early (<10)–passage primary foreskin fibroblasts
(PFF; American Type Culture Collection) were treated with 25 ng/mL TNF-a
or PBS for 16 h, and poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated using an Oligotex Direct
mRNA Midi Kit (Qiagen). mRNA (2 Ag) was used to generate cDNA using
an oligo(dT) T7 primer and Superscript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen).

G0S2 Interacts with and Antagonizes Bcl-2

Figure 1. G0S2 is a NF-nB–dependent downstream target of
TNF-a that encodes a mitochondrial protein. A, G0S2 expression
was analyzed by Northern blot (left) or immunoblotting (right ) in
TNF-a–treated PFFs. GAPDH and tubulin were monitored as
loading controls. B, RT-PCR analysis monitoring G0S2 expression
in TNF-a–treated PFFs infected with Ad-LacZ or Ad-InB-SR. C,
top, immunofluorescence of G0S2-HA–expressing H1299 cells
stained with an a-HA antibody (left ) or Mitotracker (middle ). Right,
merged images. Bottom, immunofluorescence of H1299 cells
expressing EGFP-G0S2 or empty vector (EGFP-C1). Cells were
visualized for GFP (left ) or Mitotracker (middle ). D, biochemical
fractionation. Whole-cell extracts prepared from TNF-a–treated
PFF cells were separated into mitochondrial (Mito ) and
cytoplasmic (Cyto ) fractions and immunoblotted for G0S2, Aurora
A (a cytoplasmic protein), or cyclooxygenase IV (COX IV ; a
mitochondria marker).

The cDNA was in vitro transcribed using the T7 Megascript Kit (Ambion).
The resulting cRNA was fragmented by heating at 94jC for 30 min and
hybridized against Affymetrix Hu6800 and Hu35K microarrays, which were
scanned and analyzed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite software. Raw data
have been submitted to the Array Express repository.3
G0S2 expression analysis. For Northern blots, 1 Ag poly(A)+ mRNA
was loaded per lane and hybridized with a random primer-labeled probe
for G0-G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH). For immunoblotting, PFFs were treated with TNF-a, and
16 h later, whole-cell extracts were made by lysing cells in 1 Laemmli
buffer. Blots were probed with a G0S2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (generated
by Covance Laboratories by immunizing rabbits with purified, recombinant
His-tagged G0S2 produced in Escherichia coli) or tubulin monoclonal
antibody (Sigma) followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated a-Ig secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences).
Reverse transcription PCR analysis. PFFs were infected with Ad-LacZ
or Ad-InB-SR and treated with TNF-a (25 ng/mL) or PBS. Twenty-four hours
later, total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and used to
perform reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). For the demethylation experiments, cells were treated with 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A as
described previously (7).
Plasmid and adenovirus construction. G0S2 was cloned by RT-PCR
amplification using poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from TNF-a–treated PFFs.
The PCR product, including the sequence for the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope,
was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA-G0S2-HA.
Plasmids expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-G0S2
and G0S2-enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (EYFP) were derived
by subcloning the G0S2 sequence from pcDNA3-G0S2-HA into pEGFP-C1
(Clontech) or pEYFP (Clontech), respectively. To generate GFP-tagged G0S2
deletion mutants, truncated G0S2 sequences were PCR amplified and cloned
into pEGFP-C1. Point mutations in G0S2 were generated using the

QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) using pcDNA3-G0S2-HA as the
template. All clones were confirmed by restriction digest analysis and DNA
sequencing.
To construct plasmids expressing NH2-terminal FLAG-tagged Bcl-2
family members, the corresponding cDNAs (obtained from Stanley
Korsmeyer) were PCR amplified and cloned into p3XFLAG-myc-CMV-26
(Sigma). To construct the plasmid expressing Bax-V5, Bax cDNA was
PCR amplified and cloned into pcDNA4-V5/V5HisA (Invitrogen). Plasmids
expressing Bcl-2-enhanced cyan fluorescence protein (ECFP) and Bad-ECFP
were generated by cloning PCR-amplified cDNAs into pECFP-C1.
Adenovirus vectors expressing wild-type G0S2 (Ad-G0S2) or the
G0S2(R57A,D58A) mutant, both containing a single HA epitope at the
COOH terminus, were generated using the AdEasy XL Adenoviral Vector
System (Stratagene). Adenovirus vectors Ad-LacZ (8) and Ad-InB-SR (9)
have been described previously. Target cells were infected with adenovirus
vectors at f80% confluence at a multiplicity of infection of 35 plaqueforming units/cell.
Immunofluorescence and fluorescence microscopy. H1299 cells
(American Type Culture Collection) were transfected using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche). Thirty-six hours later, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS), permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 (in PBS), and
stained with an a-HA monoclonal antibody (Sigma) followed by a-mouse
Ig Texas red–conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) or
Mitotracker (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). Cells were visualized with a Zeiss
Axiophot2 fluorescence microscope using Axiovision 3.1 software.
Biochemical fractionation. Mitochondria were isolated from TNF-a–
treated PFFs using the ApoAlert Cell Fractionation kit (Clontech).
Immunoblotting was done using antibodies to G0S2, Aurora A (Novus
Biologicals), and cyclooxygenase IV (BD Clontech).
Coimmunoprecipitations. For cotransfection experiments, f2  107
cells were cotransfected with appropriate plasmids, and 24 h later, cells
were harvested and lysed in 1% CHAPS as described previously (10).
Following centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with 20 AL
equilibrated EZview Red a-HA beads or a-FLAG M2 affinity beads (Sigma)
for 4 h at 4jC. Beads were washed three times in 1% CHAPS and bound

proteins were eluted. Immunoprecipitated material and whole-cell extracts
were blotted and probed with a-FLAG M2 (Sigma), a-HA (Sigma), a-EGFP
(Clontech), or a-V5 (Invitrogen) monoclonal antibodies. For adenovirus
experiments, HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection) were infected,
and 24 h later, mitochondria were isolated as described above and lysed in
1% CHAPS. G0S2 was immunoprecipitated using EZview Red a-HA beads,
and immunoblotting was done using a-Bcl-2 (BD Pharmingen) and a-HA
monoclonal antibodies.
GST pull-down assays. In vitro translation of G0S2 was done using the
T7 TnT Quick-Coupled In vitro Translation System (Invitrogen) using the
plasmid pcDNA3-G0S2-HA. The GST-Bcl-2 fusion protein, in which the NH2terminal domain (amino acids 1-20) of Bcl-2 was deleted, was expressed in
E. coli from pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham) as described previously (11). GST or
GST-Bcl-2 (1 Ag) immobilized on 10 AL glutathione-Sepharose was
incubated with 10 AL in vitro translated G0S2 for 4 h at 4jC in GST lysis
buffer. Pull-downs were washed four times with lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris
(pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, 0.05% Triton
X-100], analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and visualized using a Fujifilm FLA-5000
PhosphorImager system.
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Twenty-four hours after
cotransfection, HCT116 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were
transferred to poly-lysine–coated glass slides and examined using a Leica
confocal laser scanning microscope system (TCS SP2 AOBS; Leica
Microsystems). The 458 nm laser-line was used to excite the focused cells,
and the images were captured with a liquid-cooled CCD camera. Digitized
microscope images were analyzed to select a region of interest in a single
cell to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. Spectra were recorded from three
cells and the spectra were averaged and plotted. To record ECFP emission
spectra, the ECFP donor in the selected region of interest of a single cell was
excited with the 405 nm laser-line to avoid leak-through of ECFP emission
over EYFP emission, and emission spectra were generated by scanning the
region of interest eight times with 10 nm spectral resolution and recorded
using Leica confocal software. To record EYFP emission spectra, the EYFP
fluorophore was excited by the 488 nm laser-line.

Apoptosis assays. Cells were stained using the Annexin V-PE Apoptosis
Detection Kit-I (BD Pharmingen) and analyzed using a Guava Personal
flow cytometer (Guava Technologies). UV treatment of HeLa/Bcl-2 and
HeLa/Neo cells (generated by stable transfection with plasmids expressing
FLAG-Bcl-2 or empty vector [p3XFLAG-myc-CMV-26; Sigma)] was done
by irradiating cells for 30 s in a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene). For luciferasebased assays, H1299 cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3-luciferase
(12) and appropriate plasmids. For experiments in primary cells, PFFs were
treated with camptothecin in the presence or absence of TNF-a (25 ng/mL).
After 72 h, cells were trypsinized, washed with cold PBS three times,
stained, and analyzed as described above.
RNA interference. PFF cells were stably transduced with a G0S2
short hairpin RNA (source location V2LHS-114719) or a nonsilencing
short hairpin RNA (5¶-TCTCGCTTGGGCGAGAGTAAG-3¶) obtained from
Open Biosystems.
Analysis of G0S2 expression in tumor samples. Human samples
of normal lung, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma were
obtained from the University of Massachusetts Cancer Center Tissue Bank.
Gene expression levels were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR using
Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG with Rox (Invitrogen) and
the following primers: G0S2 ( forward 5¶-GGCCTGATGGAGACTGTGTG-3¶
and reverse 5¶-CTTGCTTCTGGAGAGCCTGT-3) and GAPDH ( forward
5¶-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC-3¶ and reverse 5¶-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-3¶). For each sample, GAPDH provided an internal normalization
control. The average G0S2 expression level in the 10 normal samples was
assigned as 1.

G0S2 Interacts with and Antagonizes Bcl-2

Figure 3. G0S2 induces apoptosis in transformed cells dependent on interaction with Bcl-2. A, H1299 and HCT116 cells were infected with Ad-G0S2 or Ad-LacZ or
mock-infected, and cell death was monitored by Annexin V-PE staining. B, top, schematic representations of GFP-tagged G0S2 deletion mutants; bottom, H1299

presence or absence of TNF-a. Of the 33,000 genes represented on
the microarray, 138 showed increased expression and 27 showed
decreased expression by z4-fold on TNF-a treatment (Supplementary Table S1). As expected, this approach identified numerous
genes known to be induced by TNF-a including TNFAIP2, TNFAIP3,
and TNFAIP6 (13) as well as VCAM1 (14) and PTSG2 (also known as
COX2; ref. 15).
The gene most highly induced following TNF-a treatment was
G0S2, which encodes a protein of unknown function. Northern blot
analysis indicated that GOS2 is widely expressed in normal human
tissues and is present at particularly high levels in peripheral blood,
skeletal muscle, and heart (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To verify the results of the microarray experiment, we analyzed
GOS2 mRNA and protein levels in PFFs following TNF-a treatment.
The Northern blot of Fig. 1A (left) confirms that G0S2 was
transcriptionally up-regulated in PFFs following TNF-a treatment.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that G0S2 induction could
be detected as early as 1 h and reached maximal levels by 4 h following TNF-a treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2). Immunoblot analysis showed that, like mRNA levels, G0S2 protein levels were also
up-regulated in PFFs following TNF-a treatment (Fig. 1A, right).
To determine whether TNF-a–mediated induction of G0S2 was
dependent on NF-nB, we monitored G0S2 expression in cells

www.aacrjournals.org

infected with an adenovirus expressing a super repressor form of
InB (Ad-InB-SR), which blocks NF-nB activation (16, 17). The
RT-PCR analysis of Fig. 1B shows that G0S2 induction by TNF-a
was abrogated in PFFs expressing Ad-InB-SR but not a control
adenovirus expressing LacZ (Ad-LacZ). Collectively, these results
indicate that G0S2 is induced by TNF-a through activation of
NF-nB.
TNF-a also induced expression of cIAP1 and cIAP2, two known
NF-nB target genes (18), with kinetics comparable to that of G0S2,
whereas expression of another reported NF-nB target gene, Bcl-xL
(19), was not induced by TNF-a treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2).
G0S2 is a mitochondrial protein. As a first step toward
elucidating the function of G0S2, we determined its subcellular
localization. H1299 non–small cell lung cancer cells were transfected
with a plasmid encoding a COOH-terminal HA-tagged version
of G0S2 (G0S2-HA) and the protein was detected by indirect
immunofluorescence using an a-HA antibody. Figure 1C (top left)
shows that G0S2-HA displayed a staining pattern that was characteristic of the mitochondria, which was confirmed by colocalization
with the mitochondrial dye Mitotracker (Fig. 1C, top middle and
right). The localization pattern was not a consequence of the
COOH-terminal epitope tag, as a NH2-terminal EGFP-tagged version of G0S2 also localized to the mitochondria (Fig. 1C, bottom).

Biochemical fractionation experiments and subsequent immunoblot analysis using an a-G0S2 antibody confirmed that endogenous
G0S2 was present in the mitochondria (Fig. 1D).
G0S2 directly interacts with the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2.
The mitochondrial localization of G0S2, in conjunction with the
well-established role of NF-nB in apoptosis, prompted us to test
whether G0S2 interacts with one or more members of the Bcl-2
family. HEK293 embryonic kidney cells were cotransfected with
plasmids expressing G0S2-HA and a FLAG-tagged Bcl-2 family
member. G0S2-HA was immunoprecipitated using an a-HA
antibody and the immunoprecipitate was analyzed for the Bcl-2
family member by immunoblotting with an a-FLAG antibody.
Figure 2A shows that, of the proteins tested, only Bcl-2 was readily
detectable in the G0S2 immunoprecipitate. Significantly weaker
interactions were also detected between G0S2 and the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, which were evident only on
overexposure of the autoradiogram (data not shown).
To confirm the association between G0S2 and Bcl-2, HeLa cells
were infected with Ad-G0S2 (in which G0S2 was epitope tagged at
the COOH terminus with HA), and G0S2 was immunoprecipitated
from the mitochondrial fraction using an a-HA antibody and
the immunoprecipitate was analyzed for endogenous Bcl-2 using
an a-Bcl-2 antibody. Figure 2B shows that Bcl-2 was present in the
immunoprecipitate from Ad-G0S2–infected cells but not from
control cells infected with Ad-LacZ. In vitro GST pull-down assays
using purified GST-tagged Bcl-2 and in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled G0S2 confirmed that the interaction between G0S2
and Bcl-2 was direct (Fig. 2C).
Finally, to determine whether G0S2 directly interacted with Bcl-2
in vivo, we used a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay.
Plasmids expressing ECFP fused to the COOH terminus of Bcl-2 or
Bad (Bcl-2-ECFP or Bad-ECFP, respectively) and EYFP fused to the
COOH terminus of G0S2 (G0S2-EYFP) were transiently transfected

into HCT116 colorectal cells in pairwise combinations, and the cell
lines were analyzed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The
results of Fig. 2D show that a fluorescence resonance energy
transfer signal was observed in cells expressing Bcl-2-ECFP and
G0S2-EYFP, consistent with the results of Fig. 2A to C, but not in
cells expressing Bad-ECFP and G0S2-EYFP. Collectively, the results
of Fig. 2 indicate that G0S2 directly interacts with Bcl-2 both
in vitro and in vivo.
G0S2 induces apoptosis in transformed cells dependent on
interaction with Bcl-2. The above findings raised the possibility
that G0S2 could have proapoptotic or antiapoptotic activity. We
therefore tested whether ectopic expression of G0S2 could induce
apoptosis in transformed cells. H1299 and HCT116 cells were
infected with Ad-G0S2 or Ad-LacZ and 36 h later stained with
Annexin V-PE. Figure 3A shows that, in both cell lines, expression
of Ad-G0S2 induced pronounced apoptosis, whereas little or no cell
death was observed in Ad-LacZ–infected or mock-infected cells.
G0S2 expression and induction of apoptosis could be detected
by 20 h post-infection and the level of apoptosis increased over
72 h (Supplementary Fig. S3).
To examine whether the ability of G0S2 to induce apoptosis and
to interact with Bcl-2 were related activities, we sought to generate
G0S2 mutants that were abrogated for their ability to interact with
Bcl-2. We first delineated the region of G0S2 required for Bcl-2
interaction using a panel of G0S2 deletion mutants in which
fragments of G0S2 were fused to the COOH terminus of GFP
(Fig. 3B, top). The coimmunoprecipitation experiments of Fig. 3B
(bottom) show that only constructs harboring the central region of
G0S2 (amino acids 33-67) interacted with Bcl-2.
We next constructed a series of point mutants in the central
region by mutating pairs of amino acids to alanine (Fig. 3C, top).
Figure 3C shows that mutations in amino acids 35 to 46 retained
association with Bcl-2 at a level comparable with that of wild-type

Figure 4. G0S2 promotes apoptosis by preventing Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization. A, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing G0S2-HA,

stably expressing Bcl-2 or vector (Neo ) were treated with UV; top right, HeLa/Bcl-2 and HeLa/Neo cells were infected with Ad-LacZ or Ad-G0S2 and monitored for

G0S2 protein. However, mutations in amino acids 50 to 58 reduced
interaction with Bcl-2; in particular, the G0S2 mutant derivative in
which arginine 57 and aspartic acid 58 were mutated to alanine
(R57A,D58A) was dramatically reduced for Bcl-2 interaction.
We then tested whether the G0S2(R57A,D58A) mutant was
impaired for apoptotic activity. H1299 cells were infected with an
adenovirus expressing wild-type G0S2 or the G0S2(R57A,D58A)
mutant, and apoptosis was monitored by staining with Annexin VPE. Figure 3D shows that the ability of G0S2(R57A,D58A) to induce
apoptosis was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type
protein. The reduced ability of G0S2(R57A,D58A) to interact with
Bcl-2 and induce apoptosis was not a result of mislocalization of
the protein, as the mutant protein retained mitochondrial
localization (Supplementary Fig. S4). These results indicate that
interaction with Bcl-2 is required for G0S2 to induce apoptosis.
G0S2 promotes apoptosis by preventing Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization. We next investigated the mechanism by which G0S2
induces apoptosis. Bcl-2 mediates its survival function, at least in
part, by heterodimerizing with Bcl-2 family members, such as Bax
(20), and countering their proapoptotic activity. The coimmunoprecipitation experiment of Fig. 4A shows that addition of G0S2
inhibited the ability of Bcl-2 and Bax to coimmunoprecipitate,
suggesting that G0S2 inhibits Bcl-2 function by preventing the
formation of protective Bcl-2/Bax heterodimeric complexes.
A prediction of this model is that, in the presence of G0S2, Bcl-2
would be unable to carry out its antiapoptotic function. To test this
idea, HeLa cells stably expressing either Bcl-2 (HeLa/Bcl-2) or, as a
control, vector (HeLa/Neo) were infected with Ad-G0S2 or AdLacZ. Figure 4B shows, as expected, that overexpression of Bcl-2
protected HeLa cells from UV-induced apoptosis (left) but failed to
protect HeLa cells from G0S2-mediated apoptosis (right).
As an alternative experimental approach, we used a cotransfection strategy. In this experiment, apoptosis was monitored using an
assay in which luciferase activity serves as a proxy for cell death

(12). H1299 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing
luciferase and, as an apoptotic stimulus, Bax. Figure 4C shows, as
expected, that expression of Bax alone induced cell death as
evidenced by a dramatic reduction in luciferase activity compared
with that observed in cells transfected with empty vector.
Coexpression of Bcl-2 and Bax prevented the reduction in
luciferase activity, consistent with previous studies showing that
expression of Bcl-2 can inhibit Bax-induced apoptosis (20, 21).
Significantly, expression of G0S2 together with Bax and Bcl-2
resulted in a level of luciferase activity comparable with that
obtained on expression of Bax alone, indicating the antiapoptotic
activity of Bcl-2 was inhibited. Collectively, the results of Fig. 4
indicate that G0S2 induces apoptosis by inhibiting the ability of
Bcl-2 to form antiapoptotic Bcl-2/Bax heterodimers.
G0S2 sensitizes primary cells to undergo apoptosis. The
finding that G0S2 could induce apoptosis in transformed cells
prompted us to ask whether G0S2 also had a proapoptotic effect
in primary cells. As has been observed in previous studies (see,
for example, refs. 16, 22), we found that treatment of primary
fibroblasts, such as PFFs, with TNF-a did not induce apoptosis (see
below). However, we tested whether TNF-a treatment sensitized
cells to apoptosis. Toward this end, PFFs were treated with a series
of low concentrations of the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin, a
known inducer of apoptosis, in the presence or absence of TNF-a.
The results of Fig. 5A indicate that TNF-a treatment resulted
in increased apoptosis, indicating that the net effect of TNF-a
treatment is proapoptotic.
To determine whether G0S2 was responsible for the proapoptotic activity of TNF-a, we performed a RNA interference
experiment. The results of Fig. 5B indicate that short hairpin
RNA–mediated knockdown of G0S2 (Supplementary Fig. S5)
abrogated the ability of TNF-a to increase the level of camptothecin-induced apoptosis. Thus, G0S2 is a TNF-a–inducible gene
required for sensitizing PFFs to undergo apoptosis.

Finally, we asked whether ectopic expression of G0S2 was
sufficient to sensitize PFFs to undergo apoptosis. PFFs were
infected with Ad-G0S2 or Ad-LacZ and 24 h later challenged with
various doses of camptothecin. The results of Fig. 5C show that
ectopic expression of G0S2 resulted in a higher level of apoptosis,
whereas little or no cell death was observed in control Ad-LacZ–
infected cells. Thus, G0S2 is sufficient to sensitize primary cells to
undergo apoptosis in response to DNA damage.
G0S2 is epigenetically silenced in human cancer cell lines.
Many genes that negatively regulate cell survival are epigenetically
silenced in human cancers through promoter hypermethylation
(reviewed in ref. 23). Notably, the G0S2 promoter contains a CpGrich island (24), suggesting that it may undergo epigenetic silencing. To test this hypothesis, we monitored G0S2 expression in
a panel of human cancer cell lines before and after treatment
with the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine and the
histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. The RT-PCR results
of Fig. 6A show that G0S2 expression was induced by 5-aza-2¶deoxycytidine/trichostatin A treatment in all human cancer cell
lines examined but not in normal PFFs. Cell lines in which
G0S2 was highly induced were also analyzed for G0S2 protein by
immunoblotting; as expected, in all cases, 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine/
trichostatin A treatment resulted in a substantial increase in
G0S2 protein levels (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that the
G0S2 gene is epigenetically silenced in a variety of human cancer
cell lines.

Several of the cell lines in which G0S2 was epigenetically repressed
were derived from non–small cell lung cancers. We therefore analyzed
whether G0S2 expression was down-regulated in a panel of non–small
cell lung tumors. The quantitative RT-PCR results of Fig. 6C indicate
that G0S2 expression was down-regulated >5-fold in 70% of lung
adenocarcinoma samples and 90% of lung squamous cell carcinoma
samples analyzed. In addition, a search of the Oncomine cancer
profiling database (25) revealed that G0S2 was frequently downregulated in a variety of other solid tumors (Supplementary Fig. S6).

Discussion
Here we have shown that the G0S2 gene is induced in human
primary cells by TNF-a treatment in a manner that depends on
NF-nB. Moreover, we found that G0S2 induces apoptosis in human
cancer cell lines and sensitizes primary cells to undergo apoptosis.
G0S2 induces apoptosis by directly interacting with Bcl-2 and
preventing its ability to heterodimerize with Bax.
We found that the G0S2 gene is epigenetically silenced in several
human cancer cell lines and is down-regulated at high frequency in
non–small cell lung cancers. Our results are consistent with those
of a previous study, which found that the G0S2 promoter is
hypermethylated in approximately one-third of primary head and
neck squamous cell carcinomas (26). The proapoptotic activity of
G0S2 and its epigenetic repression in tumors and human cancer
cell lines raise the possibility that G0S2 is a tumor suppressor

gene. Consistent with this idea, we found that short hairpin
RNA–mediated knockdown of G0S2 promoted oncogene-induced
transformation (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Our results fit in well with several studies that have identified
other TNF-a–inducible proapoptotic NF-nB targets such as TIEG
and IEX-1 (27, 28). Interestingly, in some cell types, activation of
NF-nB is required to mediate toxicity of cancer therapeutic agents.
For example, activation of NF-nB is required for cell death induced
by doxorubicin and its analogues (29, 30). Similarly, cellular
resistance to vincristine has been shown to be mediated by
inhibition of NF-nB activation (31). Taken together, these data
suggest that in some cancer types NF-nB activation may enhance
the activity of conventional chemotherapies. It may therefore be
beneficial to determine if silencing of G0S2 correlates with low
response of tumors to chemotherapy or poor patient outcome.
