ABSTRACT
Genomic profiles of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs)
are still insufficiently understood, and the genetic alterations associated with drug
responses have not been studied. Here, we performed whole exome sequencing of
12 GEP-NETs from patients enrolled in a nonrandomized, open-labeled, single-center
phase II study for pazopanib, and integrated our results with previously published
results on pancreas (n = 12) and small intestine NETs (n = 50). The mean numbers of
somatic mutations in each case varied widely from 20 to 4682. Among 12 GEP-NETs,
eight showed mutations of more than one cancer-related gene, including TP53, CNBD1,
RB1, APC, BCOR, BRAF, CTNNB1, EGFR, EP300, ERBB3, KDM6A, KRAS, MGA, MLL3,
PTEN, RASA1, SMARCB1, SPEN, TBC1D12, and VHL. TP53 was recurrently mutated in
three cases, whereas CNBD1 and RB1 mutations were identified in two cases. Three
GEP-NET patients with TP53 mutations demonstrated a durable response and one small
intestinal grade (G) 1 NET patient with BRAF V600E mutation showed progression after
pazopanib treatment. We found BRAF V600E (G1 NET from rectum and two G3 NETs
from colon) and BRAF G593S (G2 NET from pancreas) missense mutations (9.1%)
in an independent cohort of 44 GEP-NETs from the rectum (n = 26), colon (n = 7),
pancreas (n = 4), small intestine (n = 3), stomach (n = 3) and appendix (n = 1)
by Sanger sequencing. All tumor specimens were obtained before chemotherapy. In
conclusion, BRAF V600E mutation is likely to result in resistance to pazopanib but may
be a potentianally actionable mutation in metastatic GEP-NETs patients.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, the FDA approved a few targeted agents
for pancreatic NETs including sunitinib, a multi-tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, and everolimus, an inhibitor of the
PI3K-Akt-mTOR signal pathway [8]. In pancreatic NET,
sunitinib was compared to a placebo in a phase III trial of
171 pancreatic NET patients, and the median progressionfree survival was significantly prolonged in the sunitinib
arm (11.4 versus 5.5 months) [9]. Based on these data,
sunitinib was approved in the US for the treatment
of progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic NET. In
randomized controlled trials, everolimus demonstrated

Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEPNETs) are relatively rare tumors accounting for about 0.5%
of all human cancers [1–6]. Their incidence is significantly
increasing based on data from recent population-based
studies, and this phenomenon is explained by increased
awareness of the disease entity and increased detection by
advanced diagnostic modalities [1–6]. However, there has
been no significant improvement in clinical outcome over
the same period based on UK and US databases [7].

a 65% decrease in the risk for tumor progression in
pancreatic NETs [7] and a 23% decrease in patients with
non-pancreatic NETs [9]. In an analysis of 159 patients
with NETs, everolimus showed a response rate of 7.7%
with a progression-free survival of 12 months [10].
We recently conducted a phase II trial for
pazopanib in metastatic GEP-NET patients [11]. Our
phase II study demonstrated an objective response rate
of 18.9% (7 of 37, 95% CI 8.0 – 35.2) and a disease
control rate (CR + confirmed PR + stable disease) of
75.7% (28 of 37, 95% CI, 58.8 – 88.2) in metastatic
GEP-NETs. Through this trial, we observed that a
small subset of NET patients responded to pazopanib
for > 6 months. Recently, pancreatic NETs were
characterized as having recurrent somatic mutations in
MEN1, DAXX, ATRX, TSC, and PTEN on the basis of
exome sequencing of 10 pancreatic NETs [12]. Small
intestinal NETs showed recurrent somatic mutations
and deletions in CDKN1B by whole exome and whole
genome sequencing of 50 small intestinal NETs [13].
However, in another study of 48 small intestinal NETs
by exome sequencing, recurrent mutations were not
identified. Rather, 197 single nucleotide variations in a
preponderance of cancer-related genes were identified;
33% of small intestinal NET patients showed PIK3/Akt/
mTOR pathway alteration, and 72% had therapeutically
actionable genomic alterations [13]. The understanding of
genomic profiles in GEP-NETs is still incomplete and the
genetic alterations associated with drug responses have
not been extensively studied. In this study, we performed
whole exome sequencing of 12 GEP-NETs from patients
enrolled in a nonrandomized, open-labeled, single-center
phase II study of pazopanib [11].

primary NET from the small intestine, which was further
confirmed by Sanger direct sequencing. To exclude the
possibility of the occurrence of mixed adenocarcinoma,
neuroendocrine features, or both, we performed an
independent pathology review in terms of architecture,
tumor grade, and chromogranin, synaptophysin, and
CD56 immunoreactivity by IHC (Supplementary Table 1).
All of the pathological features corresponded to
GEP-NET, rather than mixed adenocarcinoma with
neuroendocrine features.
The patient with BRAF V600E mutation was
52 years old and had a metastatic grade 1 neuroendocrine
tumor. The primary mass originated from the duodenum
and had metastasized to multiple and distant lymph
nodes at diagnosis. The patient received capecitabine
and oxaliplatin as a palliative first-line treatment. After
disease progression following the first-line therapy,
the patient was enrolled in the pazopanib clinical trial.
Before starting pazopanib, mutational profiles of the
primary tumor tissue were evaluated. After two cycles of
pazopanib therapy, the follow-up computed tomography
(CT) scan revealed tumor growth corresponding to
disease progression based on RECIST 1.1 criteria
(Figure 3A). Hence, this small intestinal NET patient
with BRAF V600E mutation showed tumor progression
after pazopanib treatment, although at the time of
clinical trial enrollment, the genomic information was
not available to the clinician because this trial was not a
genome-selected trial.
We also identified the TP53 mutation in a patient
with a dramatic response to pazopanib. The patient
had a grade 3 neuroendocrine carcinoma with gastric
primary tumor location and extensive abdominal lymph
node and peritoneal seeding nodule involvement.
After failing to respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy,
the patient was treated with pazopanib. After 2 cycles
of pazopanib, the patient presented stable disease per
the RECIST 1.1 criteria (Figure 3B). At 4 months, CT
evaluation (after 4 cycles) revealed definite radiologic
tumor shrinkage corresponding to a partial response
based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria (Figure 3B), which
lasted for > 6 months.

RESULTS
Genomic profiling identifies the BRAF V600E
mutation in pazopanib non-responder and the
TP53 mutation in pazopanib responder patients
The mean number of somatic mutations varied
widely from 20 to 4682, and the mutation counts for each
case are shown in Figure 1. One case with 4682 somatic
mutations showed a mutation in MLH1 and additional
missense mutations (ATR, PARP2, RBBP8, and RIF1)
and splice site (XPC) mutations in DNA repair-related
genes, and was thus classified as having a “hypermutated”
phenotype. Among 12 samples, eight showed mutations of
more than one of the cancer-related genes (TP53, CNBD1,
RB1, APC, BCOR, BRAF, CTNNB1, EGFR, EP300,
ERBB3, KDM6A, KRAS, MGA, MLL3, PTEN, RASA1,
SMARCB1, SPEN, TBC1D12, and VHL) described by
Lawrence et al. [24] (Figure 2). TP53 was recurrently
mutated in three cases, whereas CNBD1 and RB1
mutations were identified in two cases. In our data set,
we found the presence of BRAF V600E mutation in one

BRAF mutations in an independent cohort
Next, we surveyed the presence of the BRAF
V600E mutation in an independent cohort of 44 GEPNET patients. We included GEP-NETs from the rectum
(n = 26 consisting 19 G1, 4 G2 and 3 G3), colon (n = 7
consisting 6 G3 and one G1), pancreas (n = 4, G2), small
intestine (n = 3 consisting one G3 and 2 G2), stomach
(n = 3 consisting 2 G3 and one G1) and appendix (n = 1,
adenocarcinoid). We found BRAF V600E (G1 NET from
rectum and two G3 NETs from colon) and BRAF G593S
(G2 NET from pancreas) missense mutations (9.1%)
in an independent cohort of 44 GEP-NETs by Sanger

sequencing. The cohort consisted of GEP-NET from
rectum (n = 27), colon (n = 6), pancreas (n = 4), small
intestine (n = 3), stomach (n = 3) and appendix (n = 1). All
G1 and G2 NETs were positive for synaptophysin while
rectal NETs and G3 NETs were negative for chromogranin
(Figure 4). The pathology and immunohistochemical
staining of the four NETs with BRAF V600E or G593S
mutation are shown in Figure 4 (G1, 1-cm rectal NET;
G2, 8.5 cm pancreatic NET; G3, 6.5 cm colon NET; and G3,
3.2 cm colon NET).

(q value, 0.49) frequently occurred in the pancreas, i.e.,
in three of four amplification samples (Supplementary
Tables 1 and 2). Fourteen CNV genes (MCL1, DNMT3A,
MLJ1, MYD88, NOTCH1, HRAS, AKT1, TSC2, CREBBP,
MARK3, CDH1, TP53, RARA, and BCL2) that may
potentially be actionable are illustrated in Figure 2.

MAPKAPK5 mutation in an exceptional
responder to pazopanib
Whole exome sequencing results in two cases
showed an exceptional response to pazopanib. In
these two cases, we could not find mutations in any of
the 272 recurrently mutated genes. Furthermore, we
investigated the mutation status of genes in four pathways
(hsa04010, MAPK signaling pathway; hsa04020, calcium
signaling pathway; hsa04060, cytokine-cytokine receptor
interaction; hsa05200, pathways in cancer) involved in
the primary mechanism of action of pazopanib. We found
a novel p.I16fs MAPKAPK5 mutation involved in the
MAPK signaling pathway in a patient with pancreatic
NET (Supplementary Figure 2).

Copy number variations in GEP-NET
The copy number profile of Korean GEP-NETs
clearly demonstrates a difference in CNV pattern for
each primary organ (Supplementary Figure 1). The
copy number of pancreatic NET relatively fluctuated
interchromosomally. In contrast, there was no concordance
of arm-level copy number in small intestinal NET
(Supplementary Table 2). Our copy number results are
similar to those of a previous small intestinal NET study
[13]. Moreover, arm-level amplification of 19q13.31

constructed a gene interaction network based on
recurrently mutated genes with sequencing data from 72
GEP-NETs from three datasets [12, 13]. TP53 (n = 6),
CDKN1B (n = 5), MEN1 (n = 5), RB1 (n = 4), ATM
(n = 4), and TP53BP1 (n = 4) were frequently mutated
genes. CDK1B mutation was identified only in small
intestinal NET, whereas MEN1 mutation was identified in
pancreatic NET. These genes are related to the cell cycle,
Wnt, E2F transcription factor, and DNA damage pathways.
Overall, 46 of 72 samples (64%) had at least one mutation
in cancer-related genes.
Importantly, we found one BRAF V600E mutation
in small intestinal NET that did not respond to pazopanib
and further confirmed that 3 (6.8%) of 44 GEP-NET
patients harbored the BRAF V600E mutation. BRAF
V600E is an actionable mutation in melanoma with
significantly prolonged survival when a BRAF inhibitor
is administered in patients with this mutation [25], but it is
not actionable in colorectal adenocarcinoma. To exclude
the possibility of mixed histology of adenocarcinoma
and NET, we performed an independent pathology
review and confirmed that all of the NET cases were not
adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation.
Hence, BRAF V600E is a novel mutation found in NET
that could potentially confer clinical benefit in this
subset of patients. BRAF V600E mutations have been
reported as oncogenic mutation or resistant mutation
to drugs in melanoma [26, 27] and thyroid cancer [28],
GIST [29], hairy cell leukemia [30], multiple myeloma
[31], and pediatric metanephric tumors [32]. The clinical
implications of the BRAF V600E mutation in metastatic
GEP-NET should thus be evaluated in clinical trials.
Three GEP-NET patients with TP53 mutations
demonstrated a durable response to pazopanib, either
as PR or achievement of stable disease (Figure 2).
The tumor suppressor gene TP53 is mutated in many

As our GEP-NETs included various primary organs,
we integrated our results with previously published results
for pancreatic and small intestinal NETs [12, 13]. Most of
the mutated genes did not overlap among the three datasets,
suggesting different genomic alterations according to the
primary location of the tumor (Supplementary Figure 3).
In this analysis, we found 272 recurrently mutated genes
irrespective of the organ, and we used those recurrently
mutated genes to construct a gene interaction network.
Finally, a network of 65 genes and 89 interactions
was generated after genes that did not pass the GSEA
test were trimmed (Supplementary Figure 4 and Table 2).
Genes related to cell cycle, Wnt signaling, E2F tran­
scription factor network, DNA damage, p53 pathway,
EGFR signaling, FGFR signaling, ERBB2 signaling,
PDGFR signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways were
mostly associated with these genes (Table 2). TP53 was
the gene with the most recurrent mutations, as mutations
were observed in 6 cases in various organs (Figure 5).
CDKN1B mutation was found in five cases of small
intestinal NET, whereas MEN1 mutation was found in
five cases of pancreatic NET. Mutations of RB1, ATM, and
TP53BP1 were each identified in four cases. Overall, 46 of
72 samples (64%) had at least one mutation in at least one
cancer-related gene [24]. The overall mutational profile of
all GEP-NETs, including ours, is presented in Figure 5.

sequencing of 12 GEP-NETs from patients enrolled

(n = 3), PTEN (n = 2), and TSC2 (n = 2). In a validation set
of 68 cases, MEN1 was mutated in 44% cases, and DAXX
and ATRX, which interacts with DAXX to form a chromatin
remodeling complex, were mutated in 25% and 18% cases,
respectively, with a mutually exclusive pattern. Another
important finding was that at least one gene involved in
the mTOR pathway, such as TSC2 or PTEN, was mutated
in 14% of cases. This finding is consistent with observed
clinical responses in pancreatic NET patients with the
recently approved mTOR inhibitor everolimus [8].
Banck et al. [13] performed exome sequencing of 48
small intestinal NETs and identified 197 protein-altering
somatic single nucleotide variations with a preponderance
of cancer-related genes such as FGFR2, MEN1, HOOK3,
EZH2, MLF1, CARD11, VHL, NONO, and SMAD1.
However, most of these mutations were not recurrently
identified. Using an integrated approach combining
mutational and copy number data, Banck et al. found

cancer types, and various TP53 mutations (missense,
frameshift [fs], or nonsense [*], leading to gain or loss
of function) have been identified during tumorigenesis
and metastasis [26]. Cancer cells with mutated TP53 have
accelerated tumor growth associated with increased VEGF
expression and neovascularization [27], which represents
an important survival pathway [7, 8], resulting in a
therapeutic advantage of anti-angiogenesis inhibitors in
TP53 mutant cancer patients [28]. Although our findings
should be confirmed in larger patient cohort, we postulate
that GEP-NET patients with TP53 mutation may have
enhanced angiogenesis that may be treated using an antiangiogenesis inhibitor, such as pazopanib.
Only a few reports have described the sequencing
data of GEP-NETs, and most of them were performed for
NETs from a specific organ. Jiao et al. [12] performed
exome sequencing in 10 pancreatic NETs and found
recurrently mutated genes as follows: MEN1 (n = 5), DAXX

that 33% of small intestinal NET patients showed PIK3/
Akt/mTOR pathway alteration and 72% had therapeuti­
cally actionable genomic alterations. Francis et al. [13]
identified mutations of 1,230 genes by whole-exome and
whole-genome sequencing of 50 small intestinal NETs.
Approximately 90% of mutations were not recurrently
mutated, and only CDKN1B was recurrently mutated
in 10% of patients. Moreover, only a small number of
mutated genes overlapped with previously reported small
intestinal NETs or pancreatic NETs, suggesting different
genomic alterations according to the primary location of
the tumor or that many of the observed mutations were
passenger and not driver mutations.
In our data sets where our results were combined
with previously published results [12, 13], we confirmed
that most of the mutated genes did not overlap among the
three datasets, including ours. Therefore, we constructed a
gene interaction network of 65 genes and 89 interactions
using 272 recurrently mutated genes. As a result,
traditional cancer-associated pathways, such as cell cycle,
Wnt signaling pathway, E2F transcription factor network,
DNA damage, p53 pathway, EGFR signaling, FGFR
signaling, ERBB2 signaling, PDGFR signaling, and PI3KAkt signaling pathway were mostly associated with the 65

genes. Notably, 46 of 72 samples (64%) showed at least
one mutation of these 65 genes, suggesting that about twothirds of GEP-NET patients may have a benefit from a
drug targeting these pathways.
In this study, we found that a novel MAPKAPK5
mutation involved in the MAPK signaling pathway
affected the mechanism of action of pazopanib in a
pazopanib responder. MAPKAPK5 is known to be involved
in tumor suppression, angiogenesis, and cytoskeletal
remodeling through interaction with a variety of substrates
and is associated with neurological processes, including
neurosecretion [33]. However, MAPKAPK5 mutations
have not been documented in GEP-NET. Our results will
facilitate the identification of biomarkers for the pazopanib
response and will form the basis for a further large-scale
genomic study.
The limitation of this study is that it was performed
in a relatively small number of samples from various
primary organs. To overcome this limitation, we tried to
integrate our results with previously published data of
pancreatic and small intestinal NETs. To our knowledge,
the current study is the first using NET samples from
patients enrolled in a clinical trial to identify genetic
alterations associated with drug responses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

using the Integrated Genomics Viewer (http://www.
broadinstitute.org/igv/). Copy number variation (CNV)
was analyzed by GISTIC 2.0 [20], and we investigated
GEP-NET CNV genes from drug targets defined in a
previous study [21].

Patient characteristics and sample preparation
We performed whole exome sequencing of 12
GEP-NET tumor specimens from patients enrolled in a
nonrandomized, open-labeled, single-center phase II
study after obtaining written informed consent, and
the samples were processed using protocols approved
by the Institutional Review Boards [11]. We extracted
DNA from fresh tumor tissue (n = 2) and formalinfixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue (n = 10) as
previously described [14]. The primary sites of GEPNETs included rectum (n = 3), pancreas (n = 4), small
intestine (n = 2), stomach (n  = 1), and unknown primary
sites (n = 2), and all the cases had hepatic metastasis at
presentation. An independent pathologic review by an
expert gastrointestinal pathologist (G.L.) is summarized
in Supplementary Table 1. The histological grade was
categorized as follows: carcinoid tumors and well
differentiated NETs were classified as Grade 1 tumors,
atypical carcinoid and well-differentiated neuroendocrine
carcinomas were classified as Grade 2 tumors, and poorly
differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas were classified
as Grade 3 tumors [15]. For validation of the BRAF
mutation in an independent cohort, we extracted DNA
from 44 primary GEP-NETs (> 1cm in size or > Grade 2)
and Sanger-sequenced them as previously described [16].
All research involving human participants have been
approved by SMC Institutional Review Board (IRB), and
all clinical investigation has been conducted according to
the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Mutational gene interaction network and gene set
enrichment analysis
To investigate the genetic characteristics of GEPNET, we integrated our mutation profiles with previously
published data for pancreatic NETs (n = 10) [12] and small
intestinal NETs (n = 50) [13]. To compose the gene set,
silent mutations were eliminated and then recurrently
mutated genes (mutations in greater than or equal to 2)
were selected. As a result, 136 genes were entered as a
gene set.
The interaction network was constructed from
the input gene set by ReactomeFI of Cytoscape [22,
23] [PMID: 20482850, PMID: 14597658]. Gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) for the reactome pathway
was performed within a cutoff FDR of ≤ 0.01. Finally, the
interaction network was trimmed to only include genes
that passed the GSEA and first neighbors of GSEA genes.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDINGS
We would like to express our gratitude to Dr. Joshua
Francis and Dr. Matthew Meyerson at the Department
of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA, and Broad Institute
of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142,
USA, for genomic profiling of our tumor specimens,
genomic analysis and helpful scientific advice. This work
was partially supported by a grant from the Korean Health
Technology R & D Project, Ministry of Health & Welfare,
Republic of Korea (HI14C3418).

Whole exome sequencing (WES) and data analysis
Sequencing data were generated using a protocol
that has been detailed previously [13, 17]. Briefly, exonic
regions were captured using the Agilent V2 capture probe
set and sequenced by 76-bp paired-end reads using an
Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument. A median of 129,621,217
total reads was generated for each sample, 97.72–99.28%
reads of which were aligned to the target exome using
the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) [15], resulting in a
median coverage of each base of 100X.
Downstream sequencing analysis was performed
as previously described [13, 17]. Before mutation and
indel calling, sequencing reads were locally realigned
to improve the detection of indels and decrease the
number of false-positive SNVs caused by misaligned
reads, particularly at the 3′ end as previously described
[13, 17]. For mutation detection, > 14 reads in the tumors
and > 8 reads in the normal samples were necessary to
call candidate somatic base substitutions, and indels were
detected using MuTect [18]. Germline mutations were
detected using the UnifiedGenotyper [19]. All somatic
mutations were manually reviewed and visually confirmed
