Abstract
Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed in
normal human prostate epithelium and is highly up-regulated
in prostate cancer. We previously reported a series of novel
small molecule inhibitors targeting PSMA. Two compounds,
MIP-1072, (S)-2-(3-((S)-1-carboxy-5-(4-iodobenzylamino)pentyl)ureido)pentanedioic acid, and MIP-1095, (S)-2-(3-((S)-1carboxy-5-(3-(4-iodophenyl)ureido)pentyl)ureido)pentanedioic
acid, were selected for further evaluation. MIP-1072 and
MIP-1095 potently inhibited the glutamate carboxypeptidase
activity of PSMA (K i = 4.6 F 1.6 nmol/L and 0.24 F 0.14 nmol/L,
respectively) and, when radiolabeled with 123I, exhibited high
affinity for PSMA on human prostate cancer LNCaP cells (K d =
3.8 F 1.3 nmol/L and 0.81 F 0.39 nmol/L, respectively). The
association of [123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095 with PSMA
was specific; there was no binding to human prostate cancer
PC3 cells, which lack PSMA, and binding was abolished
by coincubation with a structurally unrelated NAALADase
inhibitor, 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid (PMPA).
[123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095 internalized into LNCaP
cells at 37°C. Tissue distribution studies in mice showed
17.3 F 6.3% (at 1 hour) and 34.3 F 12.7% (at 4 hours) injected
dose per gram of LNCaP xenograft tissue, for [123I]MIP-1072
and [123I]MIP-1095, respectively. [123I]MIP-1095 exhibited
greater tumor uptake but slower washout from blood and
nontarget tissues compared with [123I]MIP-1072. Specific
binding to PSMA in vivo was shown by competition with
PMPA in LNCaP xenografts, and the absence of uptake in PC3
xenografts. The uptake of [123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095 in
tumor-bearing mice was corroborated by single-photon
emission computed tomography/computed tomography
(SPECT/CT) imaging. PSMA-specific radiopharmaceuticals
should provide a novel molecular targeting option for the
detection and staging of prostate cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy
and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in
the United States (1). In 2009, it is estimated that 192,000 men will
be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 27,000 men will die of the

disease (1). Current diagnosis is typically through digital rectal
exam and blood prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. Since the
introduction of serum PSA screening, prostate cancer incidence
rates have increased dramatically as have the number of men being
treated for the disease (2). However, 20% to 30% of men with
prostate cancer have serum PSA levels within the reference range,
resulting in false negatives (3, 4), whereas others have elevated
serum PSA levels due to conditions other than prostate cancer (i.e.,
benign prostatic hyperplasia), resulting in false positives and
unnecessary biopsies (5). Because elevated serum PSA levels do not
always correlate with disease, there is skepticism regarding the
value of broad-based PSA testing with regard to predicting surgical
cures (6). Initial results from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and
Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial showed that annual PSA testing
for 6 years and annual digital rectal exam testing for 4 years
(performed in the same years as the first four PSA tests) did not
reduce the number of deaths from prostate cancer through a
median follow-up period of 11.5 years. These results suggest that
many men were diagnosed with, and treated for, cancers that
would not have been detected in their lifetime without screening
and, as a consequence, were exposed to the potential harms of
unnecessary treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy (7).
Therefore, accurate initial diagnosis and determination of the
extent of disease continues to be a major challenge for selecting
appropriate treatment options, monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions, and detecting disease after recurrence. New
agents that will more accurately diagnose and stage prostate
cancer, as well as monitor therapy, will enable improved treatment
planning and result in improved patient outcome.
Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), also known as folate
hydrolase I or glutamate carboxypeptidase II, is a transmembrane,
750 amino acid, type II glycoprotein that is primarily expressed in
normal human prostate epithelium but is overexpressed in prostate
cancer, including metastatic disease (8–10). PSMA is an Nacetylated-a–linked acidic dipeptidase (NAALADase) with reactivity
toward poly-g-glutamyl folates and has the capability of sequentially
removing the poly-g-glutamyl termini of dipeptides (11, 12). Because
PSMA is expressed by virtually all prostate cancers and its expression
is further increased in poorly differentiated, metastatic and
hormone-refractory carcinomas (9), it is a very attractive target for
prostate cancer imaging and therapy.
PSMA was originally identified as the ligand of the monoclonal
antibody 7E11-C5, marketed as ProstaScint (Capromab Pendetide),
with a histologic profile that showed a high degree of specificity for
the LNCaP human adenocarcinoma cell line (10). ProstaScint is not
in widespread use in part because it targets the intracellular domain
of PSMA (amino terminus) and is believed to bind mostly necrotic

portions of prostate tumors and not to viable tumor cells (13, 14).
More recently, radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies that bind to the
extracellular domain of PSMA have been developed and have
been shown to accumulate in PSMA-positive prostate tumor
models in animals (15). Early promising results from clinical
trials have shown the utility of PSMA as a diagnostic and
therapeutic target (16, 17). Although monoclonal antibodies hold
promise for tumor detection and therapy, there have been
limited clinical successes outside of lymphoma because of their
long circulating plasma half-lives and low permeability in solid
tumors, particularly in metastases to the bone. Lower molecular
weight small molecules, with higher permeability in solid tumors,
will likely have an advantage. In addition, small molecules will
likely display improved pharmacokinetics in normal tissues
compared with intact immunoglobulins, making lesion detection
more conspicuous.
Recently, Maresca and colleagues (18) described the design
and synthesis of a series of small molecule inhibitors of PSMA
with the potential to diagnose and stage prostate cancers
through commonly used molecular imaging modalities such as
single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Here, we
evaluate two of the most potent radioiodinated compounds,
[123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095, for their ability to bind to
PSMA and localize to PSMA expressing tumors in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis and radiolabeling of MIP-1072 and MIP-1095. The
synthesis of MIP-1072 (S)-2-(3-((S)-1-carboxy-5-(4-iodobenzylamino)pentyl)
ureido)pentanedioic acid and MIP-1095 (S )-2-(3-((S )-1-carboxy-5-(3(4-iodophenyl)ureido)pentyl)ureido)pentanedioic acid, along with the
radiolabeling precursors trimethyltin-MIP-1072 and trimethyltin-MIP-1095,
and their subsequent radiolabeling with 123I were described previously (18).
Briefly, radiolabeling was accomplished by iododestannylation of the
trimethylstannyl precursors (S)-di-tert-butyl 2-(3-((S)-1-tert-butoxy-1-oxo6-(4-(trimethylstannyl)benzylamino)hexan-2-yl)ureido)pentanedioate and
(S)-di-tert-butyl 2-(3-((S)-1-tert-butoxy-1-oxo-6-(3-(4-(trimethylstannyl)phenyl)ureido)hexan-2-yl)ureido)pentanedioate with 50 to 100 mCi of [123I] NaI
using acidic oxidizing conditions to form [123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095,
respectively, in moderate radiochemical yields (50–70%) in as little as
10 min. The radioiododestannylation afforded the 123I-labeled tri-tert-butyl
esters that were purified using simple C18 Sep Pak columns and
deprotected with trifluoroacetic acid to afford the desired radioiodinated
inhibitors in >95% radiochemical purity. The specific activity was
determined to be z4,000 mCi/Amol.
NAALADase inhibition by MIP-1072 and MIP-1095. The ability of
nonradiolabeled MIP-1072 and MIP-1095 to inhibit the NAALADase activity
of PSMA was tested in LNCaP cell lysates as previously described (19) with
minor modifications. Briefly, LNCaP cells were collected, washed in
0.32 mol/L sucrose, and lysed in cold 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5%
Triton X-100. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000  g to remove insoluble
material, then aliquoted and stored frozen at 80jC. LNCaP cell lysate
(100 Ag) was added to 10 Amol/L 3H-N-acetylaspartylglutamate (3H-NAAG;
Perkin-Elmer) in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mmol/L CoCl2, 32 mmol/L
NaCl in the presence of 1 to 10,000 nmol/L test compounds. After 30 min,
the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of cold 0.25 mol/L
KH2PO4. The assay mixture was applied to an AG 50W-X4 cation exchange
column (200–400 mesh, H+ form; Bio-Rad Laboratories), and eluted with
3 mol/L KCl. Eluates were counted for determination of the amount of 3Hglutamate liberated. Inhibitory constants (K i) were calculated from the IC50
values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (20).
Cell culture. Human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP (PSMA positive)
and PC3 (PSMA negative), were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. PC3 cells transfected with either PSMA (PC3 PIP) or plasmid

www.aacrjournals.org

alone (PC3 flu) were obtained from Dr. Warren Heston (Cleveland Clinic,
Cleveland, OH) and maintained as previously described (21). LNCaP cells
were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Hyclone) in a humidified incubator at 37jC/5% CO2. PC3
cells were maintained in F12K Nutrient Mixture Kaighn’s Modification
Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a
humidified incubator at 37jC/5% CO2. Cells were removed from flasks for
passage or for transfer to 12-well assay plates by incubating them with
0.25% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen).
Direct binding. LNCaP cells and PC3 cells (3  105 cells per well in 12well plates in duplicate) were incubated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature with 3 nmol/L
[123I]MIP-1072 or [123I]MIP-1095 alone, or in the presence of 10 Amol/L
nonradiolabeled iodinated test compound, or 10 Amol/L 2-(phosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic acid (PMPA; Axxora), a structurally unrelated
NAALADase inhibitor. Cells were washed and counted in an LKB Wallac
Model 1282 automated g-counter (Perkin-Elmer).
Saturation binding. The affinity constant (K d) of MIP-1072 and MIP1095 was determined by saturation binding analysis. LNCaP cells (3  105
cells per well in 12-well plates in triplicate) were incubated for 1 h with 30
to 300,000 pmol/L [123I]MIP-1072 or [123I]MIP-1095 in HBS [50 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.9% sodium chloride] at 4jC. Nonspecific binding was
determined by adding 10 Amol/L nonradiolabeled MIP-1072 or MIP-1095.
Cells were then washed and the amount of radioactivity was measured on a
g-counter. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between total
binding and nonspecific binding. The K d and maximum number of binding
sites (Bmax) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using
GraphPad Prism software.
Internalization. LNCaP cells (3  105 cells per well in 12-well plates in
duplicates) were incubated in HBS with 100 nmol/L [123I]MIP-1072 or
[123I]MIP-1095 for 0 to 2 h at 4jC and 37jC. At the indicated time, the media
was removed and the cells were washed with a mild acid buffer [50 mmol/L
glycine, 150 mmol/L NaCl (pH 3.0)] at 4jC for 5 min. Cells were then
centrifuged at 20,000  g for 5 min. The supernatant (containing cell
surface bound radioactivity) and the cell pellet (containing internalized
radioactivity) were counted on a g-counter (22).
Inoculation of mice with xenografts. All animal studies were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the
guidelines set forth by the USPHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. Mice were housed under standard conditions in
approved facilities with 12-h light/dark cycles and given food and water
ad libitum. Male athymic NCr-nu/nu mice were purchased from Taconic.
Mice were anesthetized by an i.p. injection of f0.5 mL/mouse avertin
(19 mg/mL). For inoculation in mice, LNCaP or PC3 cells were resuspended
at 107 cells/mL in a 1:1 mixture of cell culture medium/Matrigel (BD
Biosciences). Each mouse was injected in the right flank with 0.25 mL of
the cell suspension. Mice were used for tissue distribution studies when the
tumors reached approximately 100 to 400 mm3. Male severe combined
immunodeficient mice (Charles River Laboratories) were implanted with
1 to 5  106 cells suspended in HBSS (Sigma-Aldrich) behind the left
shoulder (PC3 PIP) and right shoulder (PC3 flu).
Mouse tissue distribution. A quantitative analysis of the tissue
distribution of [123I]MIP-1072, [123I]MIP-1095, or ProstaScint (Cardinal Health)
was performed in separate groups of male NCr-nu/nu mice bearing LNCaP
or PC3 cell xenografts administered via the tail vein as a bolus injection
(f2 ACi/mouse at a specific activity of >1,000 mCi/Amol) in a constant
volume of 0.05 mL. The animals (n = 5/time point) were euthanized by
asphyxiation with carbon dioxide at 0.25, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h after injection.
To examine specificity, other mice (n = 5) were coinjected with 50 mg/kg
PMPA and sacrificed at 2 h. Tissues were dissected, excised, weighed wet, and
counted in an automated g-counter. Tissue time-radioactivity levels expressed
as percent injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) were determined.
SPECT/CT imaging. All in vivo experimental procedures were
undertaken in compliance with United States laws governing animal
experimentation and were approved by the Johns Hopkins University
IACUC. Male Fox Chase severe combined immunodeficient mice were each
implanted with either 5  106 LNCaP cells, or 5  106 PC-3 PIP (PSMA+)

and PC-3 flu (PSMA-) cells on opposite flanks. When the tumors reached
approximately 5 to 7 mm in diameter, mice were anesthetized using 1%
isoflurane gas in oxygen flowing at 0.6 L/min before and during
radiopharmaceutical injection. Mice were injected via the tail vein with
1 mCi of either [123I]MIP-1072 or [123I]MIP-1095 at a specific activity of
>1,000 mCi/Amol. Mice bearing LNCaP tumors were imaged 4 h postinjection and mice bearing PC-3 PIP or flu tumors were imaged at
2 h postinjection. A Gamma Medica X-SPECT scanner equipped with two
opposing low-energy 0.5-mm aperture pinholes and tunable computed
tomography (CT) was used for all scans. Mice were scanned over 180j in
5.5j, 45-s increments. A CT scan was performed before scintigraphy for both
anatomic coregistration and attenuation correction. Data were reconstructed and fused using commercial software from Gamma Medica, which
includes a 2D-OSEM algorithm.

Results
MIP-1072 and MIP-1095 are potent inhibitors of NAALADase.
The ability of MIP-1072 and MIP-1095 to inhibit the glutamate
carboxypeptidase activity of PSMA was tested in LNCaP cellular
lysates by monitoring the hydrolysis of 3H-NAAG. The K i values for
MIP-1072 and MIP-1095 were 4.6 F 1.6 nmol/L and 0.24 F 0.14
nmol/L, respectively, indicating that both MIP-1072 and MIP-1095
are potent inhibitors of NAALADase enzymatic activity. The greater
potency of MIP-1095 compared with MIP-1072 is consistent with

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

competitive binding data (18). The structurally unrelated PSMA
inhibitor, PMPA, was included as a positive control and displayed a
K i of 2.1 F 0.1 nmol/L, in agreement with the K i determined by
Tiffany and colleagues (23).
[123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095 bind to cells expressing
PSMA and are internalized. LNCaP and PC3 cells were incubated
with [123I]MIP-1072 or [123I]MIP-1095 to examine the specificity for
PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells. Both compounds bound to
LNCaP cells but not to the PSMA-deficient PC3 cells. Binding to
LNCaP cells was inhibited by either nonradiolabeled compound or
the structurally unrelated PSMA inhibitor, PMPA (Fig. 1A).
Saturation binding analysis was conducted to determine the
affinity of [123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095 for PSMA expressed
on LNCaP cells. Cells were incubated with 30 to 300,000 pmol/L
[123I]MIP-1072 or [123I]MIP-1095 to determine K d and Bmax
(Fig. 1B). Consistent with the order of potency of the NAALADase
inhibition assay, MIP-1095 was found to have greater affinity for
PSMA than MIP-1072 (K d = 0.81 F 0.39 nmol/L and 3.8 F
1.3 nmol/L, respectively). The Bmax obtained with MIP-1072 was
found to be 1,490 F 60 fmol/106 cells (0.9  106 sites/cell)
and the Bmax obtained with MIP-1095 was found to be 1,680 F
110 fmol/106 cells (1  106 sites/cell), consistent with the value
obtained with the ProstaScint antibody (12).

PSMA Inhibitors as Molecular Imaging Pharmaceuticals

To determine if [123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095 are
internalized into LNCaP cells by endocytosis, cells were
incubated with [123I]MIP-1072 or [123I]MIP-1095 for up to 2 h at
4jC and 37jC, and washed with a mild acid buffer to remove
compound that is bound to the cell surface. Figure 1C depicts
the total binding (dashed lines) of [123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP1095 and the acid insensitive binding, or internalized compound
(solid lines) to LNCaP cells. The results showed a timedependent increase in radioactivity associated with the cellular
pellet at 37jC but not at 4jC, indicating internalization in a
temperature-dependent manner. These results were confirmed by
a saturation binding analysis at 37jC, which showed an elevation
in the apparent Bmax of both compounds, indicating internalization (data not shown).

[123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095 localize to PSMA-expressing
tissues in vivo. The tissue distribution of [123I]MIP-1072 and
[123I]MIP-1095 was assessed in NCr-nu/nu mice bearing LNCaP
xenografts and the results are illustrated in Table 1. The radiolabel
was detected at varying levels in all tissues examined and generally
decreased over time. At 24 hours, blood and nontarget tissues were
at or below the limits of detection in mice injected with [123I]MIP1072 or [123I]MIP-1095. As anticipated, [123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP1095 uptake and exposure was greatest in the kidney, which has been
shown to express high levels of NAALADase (9), and in PSMApositive LNCaP xenografts. Peak kidney accumulation for [123I]MIP1072 was 159 F 46%ID/g at 2 hours and peak LNCaP xenograft
accumulation was 17.4 F 6.3%ID/g at 1 hour. Peak kidney
accumulation for [123I]MIP-1095 was 88.7 F 23.8%ID/g at 2 hours

and peak LNCaP xenograft accumulation was 34.3 F 12.7%ID/g at 4
hours. Clearance from the LNCaP xenograft between 1 and 24 hours
was slower with [123I]MIP-1095 than with [123I]MIP-1072 (P < 0.05).
There was no significant difference in the level of [123I]MIP-1095 in
the LNCaP xenograft between 1 and 24 hours (P > 0.06). [123I]MIP1095 showed a slower clearance from blood and most organs compared with [123I]MIP-1072 (P < 0.05 for blood, heart, lungs, liver,
spleen, kidneys, stomach, intestines, and testes between 1 and
8 hours) with a greater proportion of [123I]MIP-1095 cleared via the
hepatobiliary route when compared with [123I]MIP-1072. Little
uptake was detected in the brain, which exhibits high NAALADase
activity (23), indicating that [123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095 do
not cross the blood-brain barrier. Minimal deiodination was observed
for both compounds as the thyroid contained <1% of the total injected
dose at all time points. Because mouse prostates do not express PSMA
(24, 25), their prostates were not included in the analysis.

The tissue distribution of the radiolabeled antibody, ProstaScint,
was compared with [123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095 (Table 2).
Clearance of ProstaScint from blood and nontarget tissues was
much slower than what was observed for the small molecules.
LNCaP xenograft tumor tissue continued to accumulate ProstaScint over time with peak accumulation of 31.4 F 20.7%ID/g at the
72-hour time point (the latest time point studied). Unlike [123I]MIP1072 and [123I]MIP-1095, ProstaScint did not accumulate in kidney
tissue to an appreciable extent consistent with previously reported
data (15, 26) despite the fact that immunohistochemistry and
reverse transcription-PCR have shown PSMA to be expressed in the
proximal tubules of kidney (9, 27). This may be due to the fact that
ProstaScint binds an internal epitope of PSMA (13, 14), or, because
of their size, antibodies do not penetrate tissues well and are not
filtered by glomeruli. Despite the high accumulation in the LNCaP
xenograft, the widespread use of ProstaScint as a diagnostic

imaging agent is confounded by the high accumulation in
nontarget tissues. This is evident in the poor tumor/blood and
tumor/skeletal muscle ratios at the time points measured (Table 3).
[123I]MIP1072 and [123I]MIP-1095 exhibit tumor/blood and tumor/
skeletal muscle ratios >100 after only a few hours, whereas the
tumor/blood ratio of ProstaScint reached 3 only after 72 hours, the
final time point of the analysis.
Consistent with the tissue distribution studies, SPECT/CT
imaging at 4 hours after injection of [123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP1095 revealed high uptake and selectivity for PSMA-expressing
tissues: kidney and LNCaP tumor (Fig. 2, top). Additionally,
[123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095 detected PC3 PIP (PSMA +) but
not PC3 flu (PSMA ) tumors by SPECT/CTat 2 hours after injection
(Fig. 2, bottom), indicating that the uptake is specific to PSMA and is
not related to blood flow or permeability differences between cell

lines. As anticipated, high uptake was also observed in the kidneys,
which express PSMA.
[123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095 bind specifically to PSMA
in vivo. To examine the specificity of targeting PSMA in vivo, NCrnu/nu mice bearing either LNCaP or PC3 xenografts were
coinjected with [123I]MIP-1072 or [123I] MIP-1095 and 50 mg/kg
of the PSMA inhibitor, PMPA. Both [123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP1095 localized to PSMA-expressing LNCaP tumors but not to the
PSMA-deficient PC3 tumors. In addition, binding to the LNCaP
tumor xenografts and the kidneys was blocked by coinjecting the
mice with 50 mg/kg PMPA (Fig. 3).

Discussion
We describe here the preclinical evaluation of two novel potential
radiopharmaceuticals, [123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095, which

were designed to target PSMA in prostate cancer cells and tissue.
PSMA is expressed in normal prostate, brain, kidney proximal
tubules, and intestinal brush border membranes. Importantly,
expression is dramatically up-regulated in poorly differentiated,
metastatic and hormone-refractory carcinomas (9) as well as after
androgen deprivation therapy (28) and in lymph node metastases
(29). The function of PSMA in prostate cancer is unclear, although it
is reported to play a role in tumor invasiveness (30). It has been
reported that increased expression of PSMA in primary prostate
cancer correlates with other adverse traditional prognostic factors
and independently predicts disease outcome (31, 32). Numerous
studies have shown its utility as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic
target with a >90% prevalence in disease (9, 33). Additionally, PSMA
is expressed in the endothelial cells of tumor neovasculature of many
solid tumors (21, 27), indicating that it may have utility as a
diagnostic or therapeutic molecular target in cancers other than
prostate.
Several imaging modalities are currently being collectively used
for the diagnosis, staging, and prognosis of prostate cancer
metastases. Conventional cross-sectional imaging with CT and
magnetic resonance imaging rely on anatomic changes (lesions,
>1 cm) often resulting in missed lymph node metastases. Nodal
enlargement due to metastases occurs relatively late in the
progression of prostate cancer, and therefore, neither CT nor
magnetic resonance imaging is effective at detecting the oftenmicroscopic lymph node metastases. Radionuclide bone scans are
commonly used for monitoring bone metastases. However, false
positives are common as a result of inflammation, previous bone
injuries, and arthritis, and are especially problematic in older men
(34). Therefore the need exists for new methodologies of not only
detecting the primary tumor, but metastatic lesions as well.
Molecular imaging, which relies on signal from a radiotracer that
binds specifically to a biochemical marker on tumor cells rather

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

than anatomic features, may provide a means to detect both
primary cancer and metastases. SPECT and positron emission
tomography are two methods commonly used to provide
biochemical information through molecular imaging. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose is a glucose analogue that is readily taken up by
hypermetabolic cancer cells and is an efficient means to detect
many solid tumors (35–37), but is not effective in most primary
prostate tumors and metastases due to the low glycolytic rate of
prostate cancer (38, 39). Thus, we have undertaken an effort to
improve the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer by developing
molecules that target a cancer-specific biochemical marker, PSMA,
for imaging by conventional SPECT technology.
[123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095 were shown here to bind
specifically and with high affinity to PSMA (+) LNCaP cells but not
to PSMA ( ) PC3 cells. Both compounds internalized in prostate
cancer cells that express PSMA in a time-dependent, acidinsensitive manner. Because cellular internalization was shown at
37jC but not 4jC, it is believed that it occurs via the endocytotic
pathway. Recently, other PSMA-specific inhibitors (40) and antibodies (12) have been reported to be internalized through
endocytosis as well. The saturation binding and NAALADase
inhibition studies revealed an f5-fold greater affinity of MIP-1095
over MIP-1072. This is likely a result of additional hydrophobic
contacts outside of the PSMA binding pocket. The elucidation of
the cocrystal structure of PSMA with both substrates and inhibitors
revealed that electrostatic interactions between the carboxylic
acids of the glutamic and aspartic acid residues and Arg 534/
Arg536, and Asn519 of PSMA are critical for binding (41). In
addition, there is a hydrophobic pocket accessory to the active site
that may be exploited in the rational design of inhibitors. This
information led us to design inhibitors based on a glutamate-ureaX heterodimer structural motif where X corresponds to an a amino
acid. These molecules contain the three carboxylic acid groups

required for binding to PSMA. The urea functional group interacts
with the Zn2+ containing active site and the side chains of Tyr552
and His553. Substantial differences in affinity have been reported
for other halogenated glutamate-urea-lysine heterodimers of this
series as a consequence of the nature of the halogen and position of
the halogen on the aryl ring (18). Several other glutamate-urea-X
dimers with high affinity and selectivity for PSMA-expressing cells
and xenografts have also been described (42–48).
[123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095 exhibited peak LNCaP tumor
uptake of 17.3 F 6.3 (at 1 hour) and 34.3 F 12.7 (at 4 hours) % ID/g,
respectively. However, high uptake was also observed in the mouse
kidneys, which could be blocked by the structurally unrelated
PSMA inhibitor, PMPA, indicating that the uptake was mediated by
specific binding to PSMA. Several reports have confirmed that
PSMA is expressed in the mouse kidneys (25, 49), and similar
results have been shown with other agents targeting PSMA (43–46).
Neither compound accumulated in the brain to an appreciable
extent indicating that they do not cross the blood-brain barrier and
are unlikely to interfere with the physiologic NAALADase activity of
glutamatergic neurotransmission. In this regard, most imaging
radiopharmaceuticals do not elicit pharmacologic responses as the
actual mass of compound administered is typically at tracer levels.
In addition, although PSMA is expressed in the human prostate
and kidneys, a defined physiologic role has yet to be established so
it is difficult to predict the effect that [123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP1095 may have a priori.
As ProstaScint is the only Food and Drug Administration–
approved imaging agent used exclusively for the detection of
prostate cancer, we sought to compare the tissue distribution
of [ 123 I]MIP-1072 and [ 123 I]MIP-1095 with ProstaScint in
LNCaP-bearing xenograft mice. All three compounds localized to
PSMA-expressing LNCaP xenografts but with very different
pharmacokinetic profiles. [123I]MIP-1072 is cleared more rapidly
from target and nontarget tissues and primarily through urinary
excretion, whereas [123I]MIP-1095 is cleared by both urinary and
hepatobiliary routes. The differences in the clearance profiles do
not seem to be related to metabolism as both compounds are
stable in liver microsomes and blood plasma (data not shown).
ProstaScint, like most antibodies, clears from the blood very slowly
with peak accumulation in the LNCaP xenograft at the latest time
point studied, resulting in a low tumor/background ratio and
prolonged total body exposure to radiation. One other disadvantage of ProstaScint is that it targets the intracellular domain of
PSMA (13, 14), and because antibodies do not readily cross the cell
membrane; it is thought that it binds only to necrotic cells of
prostate tumors. More recently, however, anti-PSMA monoclonal
antibodies that target an extracellular domain of PSMA, e.g., J591,
have entered into clinical trials (50). We have designed small
molecules with affinities similar to that of ProstaScint and J591, but
with enhanced ability to diffuse into the extravascular space and
with faster blood clearance. [123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095
retain high accumulation in PSMA-expressing xenografts as evident

by the tissue distribution results and the SPECT/CT images. Thus,
we believe radiolabeled small molecule radiopharmaceuticals that
bind PSMA offer the preferred approach. Nonetheless, ProstaScint
and J591 have validated PSMA as an excellent target for the
molecular imaging of prostate cancer.
Although the initial focus here is on using [123I]MIP-1072 and
123
[ I]MIP-1095 for the detection of prostate cancer, it may be
possible to substitute 123I with 131I for targeted radiotherapy of
prostate cancer. 131I is commonly used in the treatment of thyroid
cancer as it emits high-energy (606 keV) h particles capable of
ablating tumors. Of course, the potential for radiotherapy will
depend upon the dose to nontarget tissues, in particular, the
kidneys, which based on the data presented here are likely to be
dose limiting. PSMA has been shown by immunohistologic
techniques to be expressed in human kidneys (9, 27). However,
there is no information on the level of expression in human kidneys
compared with mouse kidneys. A phase I clinical trial is currently
under way to evaluate [123I]MIP-1072 and [123I]MIP-1095 in
patients with metastatic prostate cancer. If the extrapolated
dosimetry data from this trial implies that the radiation to
nontarget organs and tissues is tolerable, radiolabeling either MIP1072 or MIP-1095 with 131I could be a powerful tool in the
eradication of prostate cancer, whereby patients with positive
[123I]MIP-1072 or [123I]MIP-1095 diagnostic scans may then be
treated with the same compound radiolabeled with 131I.
In conclusion, there currently exists a grave unmet medical need
for new imaging modalities to assist physicians in selecting
appropriate treatment regimens for prostate cancer and improving
patient outcomes. We believe that the widespread availability of
low-molecular-weight radiopharmaceuticals such as [123I]MIP-1072
and [123I]MIP-1095, which may be capable of detecting both the
primary prostate cancer as well as soft tissue and bone metastases,
will not only satisfy this critical unmet need, but could alter the
current paradigm for the detection and staging of prostate cancer
and offer a unique opportunity to follow response to systemic
therapies by noninvasive external imaging. Patient management
would be significantly improved as these molecular imaging
pharmaceuticals are designed to track specifically both the location
and progression of prostate tumor metastases through their PSMA
expression.
