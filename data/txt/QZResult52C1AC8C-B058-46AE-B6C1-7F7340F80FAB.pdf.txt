BACKGROUND: It is well known that 1a,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25[OH]2D3) restrains cell proliferation and induces
differentiation and apoptosis in normal and tumor cells. The authors of this report recently demonstrated that
1,25(OH)2D3 effectively inhibits the proliferation of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cell lines. The antitumor activity and
the underlying mechanism of 22-oxa-D3, an analog of vitamin D, in mice and in tissue cultures from patients with
CCA were further explored in the current study. METHODS: Cell growth and cell cycle distribution were examined in
CCA cells by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry. Mice
were injected subcutaneously with 4  106 CCA cells at both flank sides and intraperitoneal injections with phosphate-buffered saline or 22-oxa-D3(15 lg/kg/day) for 17 days thereafter. Tumors were removed the next day. The
expression levels of cyclin D1 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 were determined by Western blot analysis
and immunohistochemistry. Growth inhibition of 22-oxa-D3 in fresh tissue samples from patients with CCA was analyzed by using a histodrug response assay. RESULTS: 22-Oxa-D3 effectively suppressed the growth of CCA cell lines
in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. 22-Oxa-D3 arrested CCA cells at G1 phase to S phase by the suppression of cyclin D1 expression and the up-regulation of p21. Supplementation of 22-oxa-D3 to CCA-inoculated mice
significantly inhibited tumor growth without hypercalcemia or serious side effects. The treatment also induced cellular
apoptosis in tissue samples from patients with CCA. CONCLUSIONS: 22-Oxa-D3 effectively suppressed tumor growth
in CCA-inoculated mice and induced cellular apoptosis in tissue samples from patients with CCA. The current data encourage further investigation of 1,25(OH)2D3 or its analogues as therapeutic agents in the treatment of patients with

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), an aggressive and lethal cancer, arises from biliary epithelium within either the
intrahepatic or the extrahepatic biliary tract. The global incidence of CCA is low compared with that of hepatoma, although
the rates of mortality and incidence of CCA have been noted increasingly worldwide.1 Because CCA is difficult to diagnose
at an early stage, almost all patients with CCA present with advanced, incurable disease. Even in patients who have undergone complete surgical resection, the recurrence rate remains quite high; consequently, the low 5-year survival rate ranges
from 0% to 40%.2,3 Therefore, novel treatment strategies directed against this malignancy constitute an urgent need.
Apart from the regulation of calcium homeostasis, it has been demonstrated that 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3(1,25[OH]2D3), the active form of vitamin D, controls the differentiation and proliferation of many human cancer cells,
including cancers of the breast,4 prostate,5 liver,6 and colon.7 Several clinical trials using 1,25(OH)2D3 either as a single agent
or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs have indicated the effectiveness of vitamin D in controlling tumor

growth.8,9 The clinical application of this compound is
limited, however, because of its hypercalcemia-inducing activity.10 For this reason, various synthetic vitamin D3 compounds with reduced calcemic activity have been
developed. A vitamin D analog, 22-oxa-1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (22-oxa-D3), has reduced calcemic activity but
strong action for controlling cell proliferation and
differentiation.11,12
In a previous report on up-regulation of the vitamin
D receptor (VDR) in tumor bile duct epithelium from
patients with CCA, we reported that supplementation
with 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly reduced the proliferation
of CCA cells in a dose-dependent manner.13 Moreover,
the action of 1,25(OH)2D3 depended on the basal level of
cellular VDR. In the current study, we demonstrated further that 22-oxa-D3 can significantly suppress the growth
of CCA cells in inoculated mice without a hypercalcemic
effect. The effectiveness of 22-oxa-D3 in controlling the
growth of primary tissue cultures from patients with CCA
also was demonstrated, and we explored the molecular
mechanism by which 22-oxa-D3 controlled the growth of
CCA cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines
Two CCA cell lines, KKU-M213 and KKU-M214, were
established as described previously.14 Cells were cultured
in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium supplemented with
10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 C in a 5%
CO2 atmosphere.
Cell Cycle Analysis
CCA cells (50,000 cells per well) were seeded in a 6-well
plate and treated with either 1 lM 22-oxa-D3 or vehicle
(0.05% ethanol) as a control for 3 days. Cells were scraped
into culture medium, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol
overnight at 4 C. After centrifuging for 5 minutes at 1500
revolutions per minute, the cells were resuspended in 5 mL
fluorescence-activated cell sorting washing medium (3%
FCS/PBS) and centrifuged as described above. Cell pellets
were resuspended in 1 mL of 1 lg/mL propidium iodine
and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. DNA content in each cell was analyzed on an LSR II flow cytometer
(BD Bioscience, San Jose, Calif). Data were analyzed using
FlowJo software (Tree Star, San Carlos, Calif).

3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide Assays
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assays were applied to test cell viability.
Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 3  103 cells per
well in a 96-well dish. The cells were incubated either
with 0.05% ethanol or with different concentrations of
22-oxa-D3(0.25 lM, 0.5 lM, 1 lM, and 2 lM) at 37 C
in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days.
Subsequently, 10 lL MTT (0.5 mg/mL final concentration) were added to each well. After 4 hours of additional
incubation, 100 lL of 0.01 N HCl in isopropanol were
added to dissolve the crystals. The absorption values at
570 nm were determined with an automatic enzymelinked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Tecan Austria
GmbH, Salzburg, Austria).
In Vivo Assay
NOD/Scid/Jak3 deficient (NOJ) mice were established by
backcrossing Janus kinase 3 (Jak3)-deficient mice with the
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) NOD.Cg.Prkdcscid strain for 10 generations.15 NOJ male mice (ages
8-10 weeks) were housed and monitored in the animal
research facility according to institutional guidelines. All experimental procedures and protocols were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Kumamoto University. Mice were injected subcutaneously with
4  106 KKU-M213 cells or KKU-M214 cells in the flank
on both sides. Then, the mice (n ¼ 5 mice per group)
received intraperitoneal injections of either PBS or 22-oxaD3(15 lg/kg per day) for 17 days thereafter. Tumors were
removed 18 days after inoculation.
Serum Calcium Determination
To determine the effect of active vitamin D compounds
on serum calcium, blood samples from CCA-inoculated
mice that were treated with either placebo or 22-oxa-D3
were collected at the end of treatment. Serum calcium levels were measured using a colorimetric method (AquaAuto Kainos Ca; Kainos Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan)16
according to the manufacture’s instruction.
Western Blot Analysis
CCA cells were lysed with NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM
Tris, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 1% NP-40), and the whole
cell lysate was separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.17 The electrophoresed
proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidine fluoride membranes (GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) and were detected

with a specific primary antibody using the enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) Western Blotting Detection
System (GE Healthcare Bio-Science, Buckinghamshire,
United Kingdom). The primary antibodies used were as
follows: anti-VDR (1:500 dilution; C-20), anticyclin D1
(1:250 dilution; H-295; both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif), p21 (1:250 dilution; EA10;
Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, Calif), and
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
(1:5000 dilution; MoAb374; Chemicon, Temecula, Calif).
Quantification of the Western blots was performed using
GelPro 32 (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, Md). Relative
density was evaluated and normalized with GAPDH.
Immunohistochemistry
Expression of cell cycle-related genes was detected on
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from CCAinoculated mouse tissues according to the standard
immunohistochemistry technique. Briefly, deparaffinized
tissue sections were blocked with 3% H2O2 and nonimmune horse serum for 30 minutes and then heated in 10
mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0, in a boiling pressure chamber
for 4 minutes. The slides were reacted at room temperature overnight with either 1:200 anti-VDR (C-20), 1:50
anticyclin D1 (H-295), 1:100 anti-p21 (EA10), or 1:200
antiproliferating nuclear antigen (anti-PCNA) (PC-10;
Chemicon) and 1:2000 peroxidase at room temperature
for 1 hour. The peroxidase activity was observed using
diaminobenzidine tetrahydroxychloride solution (DAB;
Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) as the substrate. The sections
were counterstained with hematoxylin.
Histoculture drug response assay
Liver tissues from patients with intrahepatic CCA (n ¼
10) were obtained after surgery. The research protocols
were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee, Khon Kaen University (HE471214), and informed
consent was obtained from each patient before surgery.
The histoculture drug response assay (HDRA) was
used as an in vitro drug-sensitivity test. Collagen sponge
gels manufactured from pig skin were purchased from
Sumitomo Pharma (Osaka, Japan). Cancerous portions of
specimens were minced into pieces, and approximately 10
mg were placed on the prepared collagen sponge gels in a
24-well microplate with 1 lM or 2 lM 22-oxa-D3 dissolved in RPMI-1640 medium containing 20% FCS. Tissues on sponge gels that were incubated in culture medium
alone served as controls. Plates were incubated at 37 C in a
5% CO2 atmosphere for 4 days. Thereafter, tumor tissues

Cancer

were fixed in buffered formalin and processed into paraffin-embedded tissues according to standard protocol.
Terminal deoxynucleotide transferasemediated 20 -deoxyuridine, 50 -triphosphate
nick-end labeling assay
Histologic analysis of DNA fragmentation was used to
identify apoptotic cells in the paraffin sections of the
HDRA. In situ terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated 20 -deoxyuridine, 50 -triphosphate nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) was done using the DeadEnd Colorimetric
TUNEL System (Promega, Madison, Wis). TUNEL-positive cells were quantified in at least 4 high-power fields (at
40 magnification) from each randomly selected tissue section. The protocol was approved by the Human Research
Ethics Committee, Khon Kaen University (HE471214),
and informed consent was obtained from each participant.
Statistical Analysis
The results of multiple observations are presented as the
means  standard deviation of at least 3 separate experiments. Statistical significance was determined with the
Student t test. P values < .05 were considered significant.

RESULTS
22-Oxa-D3 Suppressed the Growth of CCA
Cells by Induced Cell Cycle Arrest at G1 to S
Phase
The antitumor activity of 22-oxa-D3 in 2 CCA cell lines
(KKU-M213 and KKU-M214) was investigated. CCA
cells were treated with various concentrations of 22-oxaD3(0.25 lM, 0.5 lM, 1 lM, and 2 lM) or with 0.05%
ethanol a as control. The percentage of viable cells, as
determined by the MTT assay, indicated that supplementation with 22-oxa-D3 significantly decreased the growth
of both CCA cell lines in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (P < .001) (Fig. 1).
22-Oxa-D3 Arrested Cells at G1 Phase
Next, we investigated the effect of 22-oxa-D3 on cell cycle
distribution by flow cytometry with propidium iodine
staining. KKU-M213 and KKU-M214 cells that were
treated with 1 lM 22-oxa-D3 caused an accumulation of
cells in G1 phase compared with controls that were treated
with vehicle alone (Fig. 2A). Approximately 50% to 56%
of control cells were accumulated at G1 phase, whereas
accumulation increased to 67% to 71% after the cells were
incubated with 22-oxa-D3 for 72 hours (Fig. 2B).

The CCA cell lines KKUM213 and KKU-M214 were cultured in the presence of 22-oxa-D3(0.25 lM, 0.5 lM, 1.0 lM, and 2.0 lM). Cells cultured with 0.05%
ethanol at each time point were used as controls (100%). 22-Oxa-D3 significantly inhibited the growth of CCA cell lines in a dosedependent and time-dependent manner. Data are expressed as the means  standard deviations for triplicate assays. A single asterisk indicates P < .05; double asterisks, P < .01.

S phase of the cell cycle was undertaken. Expression levels
of the cell cycle-regulated genes cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 as well as VDR were analyzed by Western blot analysis. The addition of 1 lM 22oxa-D3 significantly suppressed cyclin D1 expression,
whereas treatment induced the up-regulation of VDR and
p21, the cyclin-dependent kinase that inhibits progression
of the cell cycle from G1 phase to S phase (Fig. 2C).
22-Oxa-D3 Inhibits the Growth of CCAInoculated Mice Without Hypercalcemia
To investigate whether the growth-suppressing activity of
22-oxa-D3 could be demonstrated in vivo, the CCA cell
lines KKU-M213 and KKU-M214 were implanted subcutaneously into NOJ knockout mice, and 22-oxa-D3(15
lg/kg/day) was injected intraperitoneally into a group of
mice every day for 17 days. For comparison, CCA-inoculated mice supplemented with PBS were used as controls.
The efficient intervention of growth inhibition by
22-oxa-D3 on primary tumors was obviously in the mice.
Figure 3A,B demonstrates clearly that the tumor sizes and
tumor weights from 22-oxa-D3–treated mice were
reduced significantly compared with those in the placebotreated mice (P < .01). Mice that received 22-oxa-D3 did
not have signs of morbidity during treatment. Their body
weight (Fig. 3C) and serum calcium levels (Fig. 3D) were
not affected by the treatment with 22-oxa-D3.
In this study, we also investigated the mechanism by
which 22-oxa-D3 exerts antitumor activity. The expression
of cell cycle-related genes, p21, cyclin D1, PCNA and

5538

VDR in tumor tissues from CCA-inoculated mice was
determined by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B). Figure 4 reveals that comparing
the results from immunohistochemistry and Western blot
analyses of tumor tissues from the treated mice with the
results from placebo mice, supplementation with 22-oxaD3, significantly reduced the expression of cyclin D1 and
up-regulated the expression of p21. Consequently, the
expression of PCNA, which is used as a proliferative index,
was reduced in tumors from the treated mice. Increased
expression of VDR in the treated group also was noted.
22-Oxa-D3 Stimulated Apoptosis and
Necrosis in CCA Patient Tissues
The HDRA is representative of an in vitro drug-response
assay for anticancer agents. Several clinical studies have
revealed that inhibition rates obtained from HDRA can
predict the clinical responses to chemotherapy of corresponding patients. In the current study, HDRA was performed on 3 tissue samples from patients with CCA.
Figure 5A reveals that culturing tumor tissues in the presence of 1 lM or 2 lM 22-oxa-D3 for 4 days significantly
induced cell death, as determined by TUNEL assay. The
percentages of apoptotic cells observed in control tissues
were 21.76%  16% compared with 34.72%  21% and
40.27%  19%, respectively, in tissues that were incubated with 1 lM and 2 lM 22-oxa-D3. Increased apoptosis of CCA tissues that were treated with 22-oxa-D3 was
significant (P < .05) (Fig. 5B). The results indicate that
22-oxa-D3 has an antitumor effect in human CCA tissues.

DISCUSSION
In the past 2 decades, an increasing body of evidence has
demonstrated 1,25(OH)2D3 effectively inhibits the proliferation of a variety of malignant cells.18 In our previous
report, we observed that the overexpression of VDR in
CCA tissues was a good prognostic indication.13 The
addition of 1,25(OH)2D3 to CCA cell cultures effectively
inhibited the growth of CCA cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. In the current study, we demonstrated further that supplementation with 22-oxa-D3, an analog of
1,25(OH)2D3, suppressed the growth of CCA cell lines in
culture, in CCA-inoculated mice, and in histocultures of
patient tissues. This preclinical study indicates the potenCancer

tial of using 22-oxa-D3 in a clinical trial of patients
with CCA.
A pitfall of using 1,25(OH)2D3 is its hypercalcemiainducing activity, which limits its application in clinical
practice. To provide alternatives, various synthetic vitamin D3 compounds with reduced calcemic activity have
been developed. An analog of vitamin D3, 22-oxa-D3, has
been synthesized to reduce hypercalcemia-inducing activity and to enhance differentiation-inducing and antiproliferative effects. In the current study, we used 22-oxa-D3
to clarify the growth-inhibitory effects of vitamin D on
CCA, and 22-oxa-D3 significantly suppressed the growth
of 2 CCA cell lines in a dose-dependent and time-

dependent manner. We demonstrated that the mechanism by which 22-oxa-D3 inhibited the growth of CCA
cell lines was the induction of cell cycle arrest at G1 to S
phase through up-regulation of p21 and suppression
of cyclin D1. This observation is in accordance with previous reports in cancers of the breast,11,19,20 pancreas,12,21
and thyroid.22
In our current study, the suppression of tumor
growth by 22-oxa-D3 was demonstrated clearly in CCAinoculated mice by decreased tumor weights and sizes
without creating significant hypercalcemic effects or other
serious side effects. The results from our immunohistochemical study and Western blot analyses of the tumor tissues obtained from these mice agreed well with the in
vitro results in CCA cell lines, indicating that 22-oxa-D3
enhanced the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor p21WAF and suppressed the expression of cyclin
D1. These modifications may reduce the proliferation
rate of tumor cells, as indicated by the reduction of
PCNA-positive cells in tumor tissues from 22-oxa-D3treated mice. These results are supported by several studies

5540

indicating that 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogs can inhibit
tumor growth. The antitumor activity of 22-oxa-D3 was
more obvious in our mouse model than in cell cultures.
The enhancement of 22-oxa-D3 activity and its role in
suppressing tumor growth in vivo can be explained by the
finding that, apart from inducing cell cycle arrest as a
result of enhanced expression of the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors p21WAF1 and p27Kip1,23,24, a variety of
mechanisms, including the regulation of angiogenesis,25
increased apoptosis,26 and reduced tumor invasiveness,25,27 reportedly responsible for the actions of
1,25(OH)2D3. These latter 3 mechanisms could not be
demonstrated in our CCA cell culture studies. The multiple actions of 22-oxa-D3 in vivo, however, could be demonstrated in the mouse model and may be responsible for
the impressive suppression of tumor growth that we demonstrated in our mice. Further studies may reveal more
significant applications for synthetic 22-oxa-D3 compounds in the clinical management of patients with CCA.

the body. It is believed that the histoculture method has
advantages over other methods that use single-cell suspensions and that the high value of HDRA results in its good
predictability for clinical responses. Several clinical studies
that included cancers of the gastrointestinal tract,28
ovary,29 and breast30 as well as head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma31 revealed that inhibition rates obtained
from HDRA predicted clinical responses to chemotherapy with excellent results. In the current study, we investigated the effectiveness of 22-oxa-D3 in surgically resected
specimens from patients with CCA. The antitumor activity of 22-oxa-D3 in those specimens was confirmed by
HDRA. Culturing CCA tissues in the presence of 22-oxaD3 for 4 days enhanced apoptosis approximately 2-fold
compared with that in controls. The effect of 22-oxa-D3
on apoptosis was evident in CCA tissues that were cultured in the presence of 22-oxa-D3 but not in cell cultures.
This discrepancy may be explained in part by the finding
that 22-oxa-D3 also may affect tumor stromal cells surCancer

rounding the tumor tissues. It is well accepted that stromal cells have a supporting role in tumor growth.32
The effect of vitamin D on apoptosis has been
reported in many tumor models, including breast cancer,33,34 colon cancer,35 and prostate cancer.36,37 Vitamin
D and its analogs induce cell apoptosis by regulating the
expression of apoptosis protein, Bcl family, p53, and telomerase. Decreased expression of the antiapoptotic protein
Bcl-2, increased expression of proapoptotic protein Bax,
and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria may
underlie the action of vitamin D.37,38 A key regulator of
apoptotic cell death, p53, also is up-regulated after vitamin D treatment.39,40 In addition, vitamin D inhibits the
expression of telomerase, an enzyme that adds a specific
DNA sequence repeat to the 30 end of DNA strands,
resulting in cell death.41,42
In the current investigation, we noted that supplementation with 22-oxa-D3 also up-regulated the expression of VDR, a receptor that is necessary for the genomic
action of vitamin D. This observation is was evident in
cell cultures, in the mouse model, and in the HDRA. It
also has been demonstrated that the antitumor growth

5541

Original Article

activity of 1,25(OH)2D3 is depends on VDR, and CCA
cells with high VDR expression are more sensitive to
1,25(OH)2D3 treatment.13 Therefore, increasing VDR
expression as a result of 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment should
be beneficial in patients with CCA.
In summary, the current results provide strong
encouragement for further investigation of 1,25(OH)2D3
or its analogue, 22-oxa-D3, in the treatment of patients
with CCA. The only disadvantage of using 1,25(OH)2D3
in clinical practice is its hypercalcemic effect, which can
be minimized by using its analogues, such as 22-oxa-D3.
1,25(OH)2D3 has been used either alone or in combination with anticancer drugs in many trials. A phase 2 clinical trial of 1,25(OH)2D3 in combination with
conventional chemotherapeutic drugs has been initiated
at the Srinagarindh Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon
Kaen University, Thailand.
