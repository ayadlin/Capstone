Abstract
The objective of this study was to determine whether dietary
energy restriction (DER) affects the pattern of gene expression
in three interrelated energy metabolism pathways: glycolysis,
gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle. Mammary carcinogenesis was initiated by the i.p. injection of female SpragueDawley rats with 50 mg of 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea per
kilogram of body weight. Five days following 1-methyl1-nitrosourea administration, animals were fed ad libitum
or 80% or 60% of the ad libitum intake. Epithelial cells were
harvested from histologically confirmed adenocarcinomas
(adenocarcinoma epithelial cell; ACEC) and uninvolved
mammary gland (mammary gland epithelial cells; MGEC)
via laser capture microdissection, whereas isolated RNA
was arrayed on Affymetrix R230 2.0 genome chips. Principal
components analysis revealed complete separation of the
patterns of gene expression between ACEC versus MGEC.
Further examination of the data set revealed an up-regulated
pattern of expression in the ACEC of genes involved in
glycolysis, whereas gluconeogenesis was suppressed. In
general, genes involved in the citric acid cycle were not differentially expressed; however, pyruvate dehydrogenase expression was down-regulated and lactate dehydrogenase
expression was increased in ACEC versus MGEC. Collectively,
the observed patterns of expression were consistent with the
Warburg effect. DER exerted no effect on the Warburg pattern
of gene expression or on other aspects of these energy metabolism pathways. These findings imply that efforts to target
the Warburg effect for cancer prevention are mechanistically
distinct from those modulated by DER and provide a rationale
for the combination of approaches that target basic defects
in energy metabolism and energy-sensing pathways for the
prevention of breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(24):12018–25]

Introduction
The ability of dietary energy restriction (DER) to reproducibly
and dose-dependently inhibit the carcinogenic process in multiple
organ sites is well established (1–3). To date, efforts to elucidate the
mechanisms that account for inhibitory activity have focused
either on the identification of the cellular processes affected, i.e.,
proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis, or on the systemic
factors that may mediate protective activity, primarily insulin-like
growth factor-I, adrenal cortical steroids, and adipokines such as

leptin (4, 5). Until recently, little attention had been given to the
possibility that intracellular events involving energy metabolism
might be prominent in accounting for DER mediated protection
despite the well-recognized changes in glucose metabolism known
to occur during the development of cancer (6). Although emerging
evidence indicates that DER modulates the activity of energysensing molecules and the signaling pathways that they regulate,
there have been no investigations of its effects on the genes
involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle
(CAC).
In 1920, Warburg made the observation that tumor cells, unlike
their normal counterparts, use glycolysis instead of mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation for energy production even when oxygen
is present (the Warburg effect; ref. 7). Although the reasons for this
switch to aerobic glycolysis remain unclear, emerging evidence
points to the involvement of hypoxia -inducible factor 1a as well
as oncogenes such as Akt and tumor suppressor genes such as
succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase (8–11). Moreover,
associated defects in the regulation of genes involved in glycolysis
and oxidative phosphorylation seem to contribute to both early
events during tumor promotion and tumor maintenance as well as
advanced changes including the development of metastatic
potential (12–14).
Given the central role that changes in energy metabolism play
during carcinogenesis, the present study was initiated to first
determine if differential patterns of gene expression existed in
epithelial cells excised from mammary glands (mammary gland
epithelial cells; MGEC) and mammary carcinomas (adenocarcinoma epithelial cell; ACEC) via laser capture microdissection (LCM).
The focus of these analyses was on genes involved in three
interrelated pathways: glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and CAC which
are diagrammed in Fig. 1. Having determined that differential
patterns did exist, we then proceeded to investigate the effects of
DER on these altered patterns of expression. On the one hand, we
argued that DER, via limiting glucose availability, might induce the
pattern of gene expression in mammary carcinomas to be more
like that observed in epithelial cells from the mammary gland.
Alternatively, DER might exacerbate effects causing even greater
differences in the pattern of expression within or between these
populations of epithelial cells.

Materials and Methods
Carcinogen administration and diets. Sprague-Dawley rats were
obtained from Taconic Farms at 20 days of age. At 21 days of age, rats
were injected with 50 mg of 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea/kg body weight (i.p.) as
previously described (15). For the first week of the study, rats were housed
three per cage in solid-bottomed polycarbonate cages equipped with a food
cup. Thereafter, rats were individually housed for the duration of the study.
The animal room was maintained at 22 F 1jC with 50% relative humidity
and a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Five days following carcinogen injection, all

and 2:00–5:00 p.m.), 7 days per week in order to reduce possible
confounding due to intergroup variation in meal timing, meal number,
and duration of fasting between meals. Rats in the control group were

allowed access to an unlimited amount of diet each meal whereas rats in
the DER groups were given a restricted amount of their diet each meal.
A modified AIN-93G diet formulation was used as previously described (16).
The diet fed to 20% or 40% DER rats was formulated to insure an intake of
all nutrients equivalent to the control group whereas limiting total dietary
energy by reducing carbohydrate. All rats were palpated thrice a week for
detection of mammary tumors beginning at 19 days post-carcinogen
administration. The work reported was reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted according to
the committee guidelines.
Experimental design and sample collection. Preliminary studies were
provided as a basis for statistical power calculations which indicated that
seven chips would provide an adequate biological sample for each
treatment condition of interest. To obtain the required samples, animals
in each treatment group were euthanized sequentially when a palpated
mammary tumor with a diameter of f0.5 cm was detected. Tumors of this
size were used to minimize the presence of necrosis, which adversely affects
RNA quality. Overall, mammary gland and mammary carcinomas were
evaluated from seven different animals per treatment group. This resulted
in 14 samples from each group (control, 20% DER and 40% DER), i.e., seven
epithelial cell samples from mammary glands and seven epithelial cell
samples from mammary adenocarcinomas. The 42 samples evaluated were
collected from 21 animals because a mammary gland and adenocarcinoma
pair was excised from the same animal. Because of the potent inhibitory
activity of DER against mammary carcinogenesis, which decreases cancer
incidence, prolongs cancer latency, and slows tumor growth, it required
12 weeks (study duration) for a sufficient number of tumor-bearing animals
to occur in the 40% DER group.
Following inhalation of gaseous carbon dioxide and cervical dislocation,
rats were then skinned and the skin was examined under translucent light
to locate mammary tumors. The tumors were excised and snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen. The contralateral abdominal inguinal mammary gland chain
was excised, prepared as a whole mount on transparency film, and snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were stored at 80jC. A representative
section of frozen mammary gland near the lymph node region in gland 4 was
selected for LCM. Tissue scrapes from frozen sections of both mammary
gland and tumor were done to verify sample RNA integrity prior to LCM.
All sections were also examined histologically before LCM. Only mammary
adenocarcinomas and mammary glands confirmed to be free of pathologies
were evaluated. Animals from each group were evaluated sequentially to
determine if they met these criteria based on time of tumor detection;
providing an unbiased approach for selecting the animals used for analysis.
LCM. Tumor and mammary gland cryosections were cut at 7 and 10 Am,
respectively, and stored frozen at 80jC in nuclease-free slide boxes. Slides
were removed one at a time from a slide box stored under dry ice and
dehydrated using nuclease-free HistoGene (Molecular Devices) reagents
according to the following modified protocol: 75% ethanol, water, 75%
ethanol, 95% ethanol, and 100% ethanol all for 30 s each followed by xylene
for 1 min and air-drying for 1 min. LCM was performed using an AutoPix
instrument (Molecular Devices). Dehydration and LCM was limited to
30 min or less for each sample collected. A total of four caps were collected
for each tumor and eight caps for each mammary gland.
RNA isolation. RNA in the epithelial cells dissected from mammary
gland and mammary carcinomas via LCM were isolated using PicoPure
RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus Bioscience). Briefly, the epithelial cells were
incubated with 30 AL of extraction buffer in a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube
at 42jC for 30 min before centrifuging at 800  g for 2 min. The RNA was
isolated using an RNA purification column following the manufacturer’s
instructions (Arcturus Bioscience).
Total RNA quantity and integrity. The total RNA concentration of each
sample was determined using a NanoDrop ND-3300 Fluorospectrometer
(NanoDrop). The assay measured the fluorescence of RiboGreen dye at
525 nm following excitation at 470 nm. RNA concentration was computed
based on a standard curve. The integrity of RNA was examined using an
Experion analyzer (Bio-Rad) with Experion RNA HighSens Analysis Kit.
RNA amplification and labeling for microarray. The Ovation Biotin
RNA amplification and labeling system from NuGEN Technologies, Inc., was

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

used for amplification and labeling. The Ovation Biotin System is powered
by Ribo-SPIA Technology, a rapid, simple, and sensitive RNA amplification
process. A detailed protocol is described in the users guide kit and was used
without modification. The total of 3 to 5 Ag of RNA per sample was
amplified. Briefly, first-strand cDNA was prepared from 20 ng of total RNA
using a unique first-strand DNA/RNA chimeric primer and reverse
transcriptase. The primer has a DNA portion that hybridizes to the
5¶ portion of the polyadenylate sequence. This resulted in a cDNA/mRNA
hybrid molecule containing a unique RNA sequence at the 5¶ end of the
cDNA strand. Fragmentation of the mRNA within the cDNA/mRNA
complex created priming sites for DNA polymerase to synthesize a second
strand, which included DNA complementary to the 5¶ unique sequence from
the first-strand chimeric primer. This resulted in the formation of a doublestranded cDNA with a unique DNA/RNA heteroduplex at one end. SPIA
amplification was achieved using a SPIA DNA/RNA chimeric primer, DNA
polymerase, and RNase H in a homogeneous isothermal assay that provided
highly efficient amplification of DNA sequences. RNase H was used to
degrade RNA in the DNA/RNA heteroduplex at the 5¶ end of the first cDNA
strand. This resulted in the exposure of a DNA sequence that was available
for binding a second SPIA DNA/RNA chimeric primer. DNA polymerase
then initiated replication at the 3¶ end of the primer, displacing the existing
forward strand. The RNA portion at the 5¶ end of the newly synthesized
strand was again removed by RNase H, exposing part of the unique priming
site for initiation of the next round of cDNA synthesis. The process was
repeated, resulting in rapid accumulation of cDNA with sequence complementary to the original mRNA. The single-stranded cDNA generated
during the amplification process was fragmented by an enzymatic reaction
that produced product mostly <250 bases with an average length ranging
from 50 to 100 bases. The fragmented product was labeled with biotin using
a chemical attachment method described in the guide. Targets containing
amplified, fragmented, and biotin-labeled cDNA generated using the
Ovation Biotin System were prepared for analysis on GeneChip Rat
Genome 230 2.0 Arrays according to the Affymetrix GeneChip expression
analysis technical manual (revision 4). Components and supply sources
used in the hybridization cocktail were specified in the manual. To prepare
the target for a single array, 2.2 Ag of fragmented, biotin-labeled, and amplified cDNA was mixed at room temperature with the volumes of hybridization cocktail components indicated in the manual. Water was added to
bring the final volume to 220 AL. The hybridization cocktail was heat denatured at 99jC for 2 min immediately before loading the solution into arrays.
Hybridization, washing, and staining of the Affymetrix GeneChip
Rat Genome 230 2.0 Arrays. Hybridization was performed by incubating
200 AL of the above hybridization cocktail to the Affymetrix GeneChip
arrays (Affymetrix, Inc.). Hybridization occurred at 45jC for 16 h using
a GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix). After hybridization,
the hybridization solutions were removed and the arrays washed and
stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin using a GeneChip Fluidics Station
450 (Affymetrix). Arrays were read at a resolution of 2.5 to 3 Am using the
GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix).
Statistical analyses. The effects of treatment on cancer latency were
evaluated by life table analysis (17). Raw expression values from the
Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 chip were analyzed using Partek software
(Partek Incorporated). Raw intensity values were imported by setting up
robust multiarray analysis background correction, quartile normalization,
and log transformation. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed as implemented in Partek as it is an excellent method for
visualizing high-dimensional data. To identify pathway-specific effects, gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used (the Broad Institute/Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in addition to multivariate ANOVA (18).
Descriptive statistics for individual genes between MGECs and mammary
tumor cells or among different DER groups were computed using Systat
software (version 12).

PCA. The expression data from the 42 Affymetrix chips
were normalized using the robust multiarray analysis algorithm
in Partek version 2.0. Those data were then subjected to PCA. As

shown in Fig. 2A, at the whole-chip level, there was complete
separation of expression patterns for RNA isolated from epithelial
cells captured from mammary carcinomas versus mammary glands.
Although differences were also discernable among levels of DER
within either the mammary gland or mammary carcinomas, the
distinctions were less pronounced (Fig. 2B and C, respectively).

GSEA. The analysis of the microarray data was broken into two
components: (a) the comparison of patterns of expression between
mammary glands and mammary carcinomas; and (b) the
comparison of patterns of gene expression associated with DER.
Mammary gland versus mammary carcinomas. The specific
hypothesis tested using GSEA was that there would be differential
transcriptional regulation of genes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the CAC in mammary glands versus mammary
carcinomas. To test this hypothesis, the genes involved in each
metabolic pathway were compiled and run simultaneously in
GSEA. The heat maps showing the consistency of expression for
each gene on each chip for glycolysis, CAC, and gluconeogenesis
are shown in Fig. 3A, B, and C, respectively. The overall P value for
a differential regulation of these pathways between mammary
gland and mammary carcinomas at the 10% false discovery rate
was P < 0.037. That analysis indicated a dominant up-regulation
of genes involved in glycolysis in mammary carcinomas relative
to mammary glands; whereas gluconeogenesis was suppressed in
that the principal regulatory protein, phosphoenolpyruvate carb-

oxykinase, was dramatically down-regulated. In general, most
genes involved in CAC were not differentially expressed in mammary gland versus mammary carcinomas but with two important
exceptions. Transcript levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase were
significantly lower and levels for lactate dehydrogenase were
markedly higher in mammary carcinomas versus mammary gland.
To further evaluate and quantify the differences observed, the
normalized expression data were analyzed by multivariate ANOVA.
Table 1 contains a list of the genes investigated and the mean
level of expression for each gene. The overall multivariate Hotelling statistics for the hypothesis test for differential expression
between mammary gland and mammary carcinomas were: glycolysis, P = 1.69  10 12; CCA, P = 1.26  10 11; and gluconeogenesis, P = 9.77  10 6.
The effects of DER in mammary glands and mammary
carcinomas. The heat maps generated within GSEA and shown in
Fig. 3 also contain information about the level of DER to which
each animal was exposed and consequentially from which each
chip was generated. However, the current version of GSEA only

permits comparisons between two treatment conditions. Therefore,
the effects of DER on gene expression were evaluated by
multivariate ANOVA. Figure 4 shows bar graphs for each gene in
glycolysis, CAC, or gluconeogenesis grouped according to mammary gland or carcinoma for each level of DER. Visual inspection
of those data provided no evidence that DER has an effect on
transcriptional regulation of glycolysis in epithelial cells from the
mammary gland. On the other hand, there was a pattern of
decreased gene expression with increasing DER in mammary
carcinomas. Nonetheless, statistical analyses of these data failed to
support an effect on gene expression associated with DER.

Discussion
The work reported in this article elucidated three aspects of our
understanding of mammary carcinogenesis and the effects of DER
in the 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea–induced model system in the rat: (a)
substantiation of marked differences in patterns of gene expression
in the ACEC versus MGEC captured via LCM; (b) identification of
specific alterations in transcriptional regulation of genes involved
in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and CAC; and (c) determination of
a general lack of effect of DER on these alterations at the level of
transcription. These data provide a rationale for exploring distinct
approaches to inhibition of carcinogenesis via DER versus the
modulation of energy metabolism. Each point is discussed in turn
in the following paragraphs.
Mammary carcinoma versus MGECs. As shown in Fig. 2, there
was complete distinction between patterns of gene expression

www.aacrjournals.org

characterized at the chip level between ACEC and MGEC. To our
knowledge, there have been no previous reports of differential
patterns of gene expression using RNA from laser-captured cells
from mammary tissue in the 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea model, or
more generally, in chemically induced models for breast cancer in
the rat. The complete separation of patterns of expression observed
provided the rationale for the additional analyses that were
performed.
Energy metabolism. Although the Warburg effect has been
reported to be observed in the majority of human tumors (14),
there has been limited investigation of this topic in autochthonous
model systems for breast cancer. Hence, the data presented shows
that 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea–induced mammary carcinogenesis
models the human disease in previously unappreciated ways.
Specifically, not only was glycolysis observed to be up-regulated in
ACEC versus MGEC, but there were also shifts in expression of
both pyruvate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase that were
consistent with effects observed in the human disease. Moreover,
these patterns were consistently observed across a large number
of animals. In addition, there has been limited study of effects of
carcinogenesis on other genes involved in either gluconeogenesis
or CAC. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1, the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which catalyzes a key regulatory
step in gluconeogenesis was down-regulated in ACEC. Although
this is consistent with the effects of DER on glucose metabolism in
this model system (19), these differences have not been previously
reported. Levels of DER that have marked cancer-inhibitory activity
have been reported to exert many effects; however, even in studies

in other model systems in which expression arrays have been used,
there has been no mention of whether DER modulates the Warburg
effect. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1, little evidence was found
to support the hypothesis that DER affects this aspect of energy
metabolism at the level of gene transcription. Initially, this finding
was somewhat surprising in view of the well-known effects of DER
on circulating levels of glucose as we have previously reported;
however, these findings do not rule out the possibility of regulation
via effects on either mRNA translation or posttranslational
modification of proteins and consequent effects on their activities.
In this regard, the present findings in fact help eliminate candidate
molecular processes and serve to focus research on key proteins
and their activities.

Combinatorial approach to cancer prevention. As noted in
refs. (20, 10), there is currently considerable interest in the potential
targeting of alterations in energy metabolism observed in tumors
cells therapeutically. Specifically, efforts to target pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in order to induce
tumor cell death and to inhibit the development of metastatic
potential have been proposed (21, 22). However, as noted in
ref. (14), emerging evidence has indicated that these changes may
occur at an early stage in tumor development. Hence, we propose
that this needs to be investigated and that agents such as
dichloroacetate, which is already in clinical use for the treatment of
lactic acidosis (23), might have potential use to prevent the
development of cancer and not just to kill established tumor cells.

Transcriptional Regulation of the Energy Metabolism

Similarly, applying the lessons learned in the cancer chemoprevention field suggests the potential value of a multipronged
approach to blocking tumor development. Hence, investigating
agents like oxamic acid, which inhibits the activity of lactate
dehydrogenase, should be considered in combination with agents
that target the metabolic disregulation resulting from the
inhibition of pyruvate entry into mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (24). We have dubbed agents that reverse the induction
of the Warburg affect to prevent cancer: energy metabolism
modulatory agents (EMMA).
The work reported here is important in another way. Our
laboratory has been engaged in identifying energy restriction
mimetic agents (ERMA), for the prevention of cancer. Before the
work reported herein, we argued that ERMA might be preventing
cancer via targeting events associated with altered energy metab-

olism, specifically the Warburg effect. At least at the transcriptional
level, this does not seem to be the case, but rather, prototypic ERMA
such as 2-deoxyglucose seem to be inhibiting carcinogenesis by
activating AMP-activated protein kinase (6). If the pathways by
which ERMA and EMMA inhibit carcinogenesis are distinct, it will
offer the previously unappreciated opportunity to combine these
approaches to target fundamental and highly conserved facets of
energy metabolism to prevent the development of cancer.
