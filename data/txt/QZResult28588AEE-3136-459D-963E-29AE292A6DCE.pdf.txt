Abstract
Dysregulated bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) may contribute to the development and progression of renal
cell carcinoma (RCC). Herein, we report that BMP-6 promotes the growth of RCC by interleukin (IL)-10–mediated
M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). BMP-6–mediated IL-10 expression in macrophages
required Smad5 and STAT3. In human RCC specimens, the three-marker signature BMP-6/IL-10/CD68 was
associated with a poor prognosis. Furthermore, patients with elevated IL-10 serum levels had worse outcome after
surgery. Together, our results suggest that BMP-6/macrophage/IL-10 regulates M2 polarization of TAMs in RCC.

Introduction
Kidney cancer is the seventh most common cancer with an
estimated 58,240 new cases and 13,040 deaths in 2010 (1).
Histologically, the most common type of kidney cancer is clear
cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC; 80%–85%; ref. 2). As with most
solid malignancies, localized RCC are usually cured with
surgery. However, approximately 30% of the patients with
clinically localized RCC eventually recur after resection.
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) comprise the largest
family within the TGF-b superfamily. Although originally
reported as factors that induce bone and cartilage formation
(3), BMPs have been shown to be critical for development
(4–6). More recently, we and others have reported that BMPs
regulate the immune system as BMP-6 inhibits B- and T-cell
proliferation (7, 8) and activates macrophages (9, 10). In the
context of RCC, BMP-4, -6, and -7 are often overexpressed (11,
12), whereas BMP antagonist Sclerostin domain–containing-1
(SOSTDC1) is downregulated (13). At the same time, we
observed that human RCC cells frequently have a loss of
expression of BMP receptors (11), suggesting a paracrine role
for BMP-6 in RCC.

Macrophages are an essential component of the host
defense system and have critical roles in both innate and
adaptive immune responses (14). In solid malignancies, a
large number of macrophages is usually found inﬁltrating
the tumor. These tumor-associated macrophages (TAM;
refs. 15, 16) are recruited from the circulating peripheral
blood monocytes by chemotactic factors and chemokines
(17, 18). When tumor cells arise, macrophages are capable of
mounting an antitumor response (19). However, the decision to mount an antitumor response is in part regulated by
the balance of pro- and anti-inﬂammatory factors present
within the tumor microenvironment (14, 20). Indeed, a body
of evidence suggests that macrophages in tumors can
promote cancer progression and metastasis by stimulating
angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cellular migration and
invasion (21).
One cytokine that has been suggested to play a role in
regulating macrophages is interleukin (IL)-10, a type II cytokine. IL-10 is produced by monocytes, activated macrophages,
and a subtype of dendritic cells (22). In cancers, additional
sources of IL-10 include the alternatively activated M2 macrophages and TAMs (23, 24). Because the major stimulus for the
IL-10 expression is inﬂammation, IL-10 plays a major role in
the negative feedback loop that prevents uncontrolled
inﬂammation (25). In solid tumors, IL-10 has been detected
in a number of malignancies (26). Recently, it has been
suggested that a local production of IL-10 results in a tumor
microenvironment that favors cancer cell survival and metastases (23, 27). In RCC, IL-10 and IL-10 receptor expression has
been correlated with increased incidence of metastasis (28).
Nevertheless, the clinical signiﬁcance of IL-10 and the mechanism of its induction in cancers remain largely unknown. In
this study, we report that BMP-6 in murine RCC cell lines is
protumorigenic and involves IL-10–mediated M2 polarization of TAMs.

BMP-6 Induces M2 Polarization of Macrophages in RCC

Materials and Methods
Animal studies
Balb/c and IL-10KO mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were
inoculated subcutaneously with BMP-6/RenCa and BMP-6/
RAG cells. For BMP-6 induction, drinking water containing 2
mg/mL of doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) in 5% sucrose was used.
For adoptive transfer of macrophages, 5  106 cells were
injected directly into tumors. Unless indicated, 5 animals were
used per group.
Cell culture
RAW 264.7, RenCa, and RAG were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection and routinely maintained
in as recommended by the manufacturer. To obtain murine
peritoneal macrophages (PMf), thioglycollate (Sigma-Aldrich)
was dissolved in dH2O and injected intraperitoneally into mice.
Animals were sacriﬁced 3 days later and PMfs were isolated
from the peritoneal lavage and cultured as described (29).
Primary human peripheral blood monocytes (hPBMC) were
purchased from STEMCELL Technologies, Inc. The STAT3
inhibitor WP1066 (EMD Chemicals) was used at 10 mg/mL.
BMP-6 was obtained from R&D Systems.
BMP-6–inducible murine renal cell carcinoma cell lines
Human BMP-6 cDNA was cloned into the tetracyclineinducible vector pLenti4/Dest (Invitrogen). Simultaneously,
RenCa and RAG were infected sequentially with the tetracycline repressor virus followed by pLenti4/BMP-6 virus.
Reverse transcriptase PCR
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and
reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out using the
One-step SuperScript RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was completed as recommended. For all primers, the
annealing temperature was 55 C. Primer sequences are shown
in Supplementary Table S1.
Immunoblot
Cells were harvested using the Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology). After centrifugation, electrophoresis was
carried out with 30 mg of protein using 12% SDS-PAGE gel and
analyzed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo
Scientiﬁc).
Antibodies
The following antibodies were used in this study: mouse IL10 (VWR), human IL-10 (R&D Systems), b-actin (Sigma),
human BMP-6 blocking antibody (R&D), human BMP-6
(Abcam), Myc (Sigma), mouse STAT3, mouse phospho STAT3
(Cell Signaling), Smad 5 (Cell Signaling), phospho Smad 5 (Cell
Signaling), Smad 1/5 (Santa Cruz), phospho Smad 1/5 (Cell
Signaling), mouse CD206 (Serotec), human CD206 (BD), mouse
CD163 (Santa Cruz), human CD163 (Abcam), human GAPDH
(Santa Cruz), and human ki67 (Abcam).
Luciferase assay
Luciferase assay was conducted using the Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega) as per manufacturer's pro-

www.aacrjournals.org

tocol. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). All experiments were repeated at least 3 times.
Transient transfection of BMP receptors
RAW 264.7 cells were plated onto 6-well plates and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at 1 mL/mL was used to transfect 1
mg/mL of plasmids.
RNA knockdown studies
Sequences of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and construction
of expression system have previously been published (9, 29).
Knockdown of STAT3 and STAT4 was carried out using siRNA
(Qiagen).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
EZ-ChIP Kit (Millipore) was used. Cells were harvested,
ﬁxed, and incubated with the indicated antibodies. Then DNA
was sonicated and puriﬁed with spin column and analyzed
with PCR.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot
NE-PER (Thermo Scientiﬁc) was used to separate cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. After preclearing with protein
A sepharose (GE healthcare), indicated primary antibody
was added to the lysate and incubated at 4 C. Antibody was
pulled down with protein A sepharose and washed with icecold lysis buffer and proteins were analyzed by immunoblot
analysis.
ELISA
IL-10 and BMP-6 levels in the culture media and serum were
measured using an ELISA Kit (R&D Systems). The indicated
values represent the average of 4 separate measurements.
Clodronate liposome
Clodronate- and PBS-loaded liposomes were kindly provided by Clodronate Liposomes.org. Mice were injected with 0.2
mL of either clodronate liposomes (ﬁnal dose of 25 mg/kg) or
PBS liposomes every 4 days intraperitoneally or intratumorally.
Human RCC tissues, serum immunohistochemistry, and
confocal microscopy
Seventy-four formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded human
RCC tissues were obtained from Chungbuk National University (Cheongju, Korea), whereas human clear cell RCC
tissue array containing 50 cases were purchased from Imgenex. Serum samples were available in 56 of the patients from
Chungbuk National University. The sections were processed
using a routine laboratory procedure and counterstained
with hematoxylin. The results were interpreted by 2 independent investigators who were blinded to each other's
reading.
Statistical analysis
Student t test and Pearson correlation were conducted.
Clinical data were evaluated using Kaplan–Meier and multivariate Cox analysis. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
BMP-6 is protumorigenic in RCC cells
Because published studies have suggested the dysregulation
of BMPs in RCC (11, 13), tetracycline-inducible human BMP-6
expression system based on lentivirus was established in a
murine RCC cell line, RenCa. Human BMP-6 cDNA was chosen
to track the expression of exogenous BMP-6. Previously, the use
of human BMP-6 in mouse has been validated (9, 29). Because
RenCa cells were originally derived from Balb/c mice, syngeneic tumors can be established in immunocompetent animals.
A representative result showing the inducibility of BMP-6
mRNA and protein by tetracycline is shown in Fig. 1A and
B. One clone with a relatively high inducible level of BMP-6 was
designated as RenCa/BMP-6. When BMP-6 expression was
induced in RenCa/BMP-6 in tissue culture (Tetþ), no significant effect on cellular proliferation was observed (Fig. 1C).
However, in Balb/c mice, the induction of BMP-6 (doxyþ)
showed a signiﬁcantly faster tumor growth without a noticeable change in histopathology (Fig. 1D). This protumorigenic

effect of BMP-6 only in vivo implicates a paracrine mechanism.
Along this line, it has recently been reported that BMPs
regulate immune effector cells including macrophages (9,
10). To investigate whether macrophages mediate the protumorigenic effect of BMP-6 in RCC, clodronate liposome was
used to selectively remove macrophages (30). The efﬁcacy of
clodronate liposome in removing macrophages was conﬁrmed
in RenCa/BMP-6 syngeneic tumor model (Supplementary Fig.
S1A and S1B). As predicted, protumorigenic effect of BMP-6
was completely blocked with clodronate liposome (Fig. 1E). In
these tumors, clodronate liposome had no effect on BMP-6
induction by doxycycline (Supplementary Fig. 1C).
Next, the identical tetracycline-inducible BMP-6 system was
developed in another murine kidney cancer cell line, RAG.
The best clone with inducible BMP-6 expression was designated RAG/BMP-6. When RAG/BMP-6 was subcutaneously
inoculated into Balb/c mice, induction of BMP-6 (doxyþ)
signiﬁcantly enhanced tumor growth (Supplementary Fig.
S2). Furthermore, clodronate liposome injection reversed the

weeks after the induction of BMP-6 (Fig. 2C). When these mice
were rechallenged with RenCa/BMP-6 and RenCa, no tumors
developed (data not shown). To examine the histopathologic
changes of the tumors during regression in IL-10KO mice,
doxycycline administration was started when the tumor size
reached 5 mm in diameter. All tumors were harvested 2 weeks
later. Hematoxylin staining showed a dramatic increase in
neutrophil inﬁltration and extensive tumor necrosis in tumors

oncogenic effect of BMP-6. These results collectively
suggest that the protumorigenic activity of BMP-6 requires
macrophages.
Macrophages mediate the protumorigenic effect of
BMP-6 via IL-10
When the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was
treated with BMP-6, multiplex PCR revealed that BMP-6
upregulated the expression of a number of cytokines including
IL-10. When RAW 264.7, murine PMfs, THP-1 (human monocyte cell line), and hPBMC were treated with BMP-6, IL-10
mRNA and protein were induced in a concentration- and timedependent manner (Fig. 2A and B); quantitative RT-PCR (qRTPCR) in RAW 264.7 is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3A. IL-10
mRNA induction by BMP-6 was detected as early as 1 hour and
peaked at 24 hours in PMfs. ELISA revealed that the concentration of IL-10 in the conditioned media exceeded 120 pg/mL
when RAW 264.7 was treated with 100 ng/mL BMP-6 (Supplementary Fig. S3B). This level of secreted IL-10 was comparable with that when macrophages were stimulated with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
To evaluate the role of IL-10 in vivo, IL-10 knockout (IL10KO) mice were used. After inoculation, BMP-6 expression
was induced (doxyþ) when tumors became palpable. The
results surprisingly showed not only a retardation of tumor

BMP-6 induces IL-10 expression in macrophages via
BMP-RII and ALK2/3
To determine the mechanism of IL-10 induction by BMP-6, we
used the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (ActD) and the
translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). IL-10 induction was
blocked only by actinomycin D in both RAW 264.7 and PMfs
(Fig. 3A). To expedite the dissection of the signaling pathway
involved in BMP-6–induced IL-10 expression, we next constructed a luciferase reporter vector containing the IL-10 promoter (IL-10-Luc). When IL-10-Luc was transiently transfected
into RAW 264.7, BMP-6 increased luciferase activity approximately 2.5-fold within 6 hours (Supplementary Fig. S3C).

BMPs signal through a heteromeric complex of type I and II
receptors. When each of the 3 known BMP type II receptors
were cotransfected with IL-10-Luc into RAW 264.7, only BMPRII overexpression increased IL-10 promoter activity upon
treatment with BMP-6 (Fig. 3B). Conversely, knockdown
experiments using shRNA (9) showed the suppression of
luciferase activity only when BMP-RII was targeted (Fig. 3C).
To identify the functional BMP type I receptor(s), constitutively active mutant constructs were used. Macrophages
express only 2 of the 3 known BMP type I receptors—ALK2
and 3 (9). Overexpression of constitutively active ALK2 and 3
(CA-ALK2 and CA-ALK3, respectively) increased the luciferase
activity more than 10-fold (Fig. 3D). When ALK2 and 3 were
knocked down using shRNA (9), BMP-6 no longer induced
luciferase activity (Fig. 3E). These results collectively suggest
that BMP-RII along with ALK2 and 3 are the functional BMP-6
receptors that mediate IL-10 induction in macrophages.
IL-10 induction requires Smad5
Following the activation of receptors, the canonical BMP
signaling requires receptor-mediated Smads (R-Smads; Smad1,
5, and 8) and co-Smad (Smad4). When the Smad-dependent
pathway was blocked in RAW 264.7 with dominant-negative
Smad4 (Smad4DN), IL-10 induction by BMP-6 was completely
blocked (Fig. 4A). When each of the R-Smads was overexpressed in RAW 264.7, only Smad5 transfection increased
luciferase activity upon treatment with BMP-6 (Fig. 4B). This
activation of IL-10 promoter by BMP-6 was then blocked when
Smad5 was knocked down using shRNA (Fig. 4C; ref. 29). Serial
deletion of IL-10 promoter subsequently showed that the BMP6 response element within IL-10 promoter is located between
588 and 800 bp 50 to the transcription start site (Fig. 4D).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed that
Smad5 bound to the 588 to 800 region of IL-10 promoter
(Fig. 4E).
STAT3 is required for IL-10 induction
Analysis of IL-100 s BMP-6–responsive region revealed no
consensus Smad-binding element. However, one STAT-binding motif was identiﬁed. Previously, it has been reported that
STAT5 interacts with Smad2 of the TGF-b signaling pathway
(31). Of the known subtypes of STATs, STAT3 has been
reported regulate IL-10 expression (32). Accordingly, immunoblot was carried out to determine the phosphorylation
status of STAT3 after treating RAW 264.7 with BMP-6. The
results showed increased phosphorylation of STAT3 (pSTAT3)
within 30 minutes after BMP-6 treatment (Fig. 5A). Blocking
STAT3 with the small-molecule inhibitor WP1066 (33) completed neutralized IL-10 induction by BMP-6 (Fig. 5B). Next,
studies using dominant-negative STAT3 (STAT3DN) and
small-interfering RNA (siSTAT3) also showed a complete
abrogation of IL-10 induction by BMP-6 in RAW 264.7 (Fig.
5C and Supplementary Fig. S4A). When RAW 264.7 was transiently transfected with siSTAT3 and IL10-Luc, BMP-6 no
longer increased luciferase activity (Supplementary Fig.

IL-10-Luc were overexpressed in RAW 264.7, BMP-6 increased
the luciferase activity signiﬁcantly (Fig. 5D). Surprisingly, overexpression of STAT4 repeatedly blocked the activation of IL-10
promoter by BMP-6.
Next, ChIP assay showed that STAT3 bound to the 588 to
800 bp region of IL-10 promoter (Fig. 5E). Because Smad5
also bound to the same region, we subsequently tested whether
STAT3 interacts with Smad 5. When each of the myc-tagged

Figure 4. A, when RAW 264.7 was transfected with the dominant-negative Smad4 (Smad4DN), the BMP-6–induced IL-10 mRNA induction was completely
blocked. B, each of the 3 R-Smads (Smad1, 5, and 8) was cotransfected with IL-10-Luc into RAW 264.7. When treated with BMP-6 (100 ng/mL), only
Smad5 overexpression signiﬁcantly increased IL-10 promoter activity.  , statistically signiﬁcant. C, each of the 3 R-Smads was knocked down with shRNA in
RAW264.7. When cotransfected with IL-10-Luc reporter and treated with BMP-6 (100 ng/mL), shRNA targeting Smad5 was the most efﬁcient blocker
of BMP-6–induced IL-10 promoter activity. D, promoter deletion analysis showed that the most signiﬁcant decrease in the BMP-6–induced IL-10 promoter
activity was observed when the region between 800 to 588 bp 50 upstream of the transcription start site was deleted. E, ChIP assay showed that
Smad5 bound to the 800 to 588 bp region of IL-10 promoter in a ligand-dependent manner. As a control, exon 3 of IL-10 gene was ampliﬁed.

R-Smads was expressed in RAW 264.7, immunoprecipitation
against endogenous STAT3 pulled down Smad5, whereas
immunoprecipitation against myc-Smad5 precipitated out
STAT3 (Supplementary Fig. S4C). The physical interaction
between endogenous Smad5 and STAT3 in macrophages,
when stimulated by BMP-6, was then conﬁrmed (Fig. 5F).
Consistent with the known functions of Smad5 and STAT3,
confocal immunoﬂuorescence microscopy showed that both
STAT3 and Smad5 translocate to the nucleus of RAW 264.7
when treated with BMP-6 (Supplementary Fig. 4D). This BMP6–induced nuclear translocation of STAT3 was still detected in
RAW 264.7 even when Smad5 was knocked down (Supplementary Fig. S4E). The reverse experiment revealed that the nuclear
translocation of Smad5 still occurred when STAT3 was
knocked down (Supplementary Fig. S4F). Subsequently, coimmunoprecipitation of STAT3 and Smad5 was observed only in
the nuclear fraction (Fig. 5G). In the absence of exogenous
BMP-6, low levels of STAT3 and Smad5 were coimmunoprecipitated out in RAW 264.7, likely suggesting a low basal level of
expression of BMPs.
In RenCa/BMP-6 tumors, immunoblot conﬁrmed the presence of both phosphorylated STAT3 and Smad1/5 (Fig. 5H).
Subsequently, immunoﬂuorescence microscopy showed the
colocalization of pSTAT3, pSmad1/5, and F4/80 (murine
macrophages; Fig. 5I). Interestingly, the induction of BMP-6
showed a signiﬁcantly higher number of macrophages within

the tumors. These results conﬁrm that both Smad5 and STAT3
are phosphorylated in macrophages upon BMP-6 induction in
vivo.
BMP-6 induces M2 macrophage polarization via IL-10
IL-10 induces M2 polarization of macrophages that leads to
local immunosuppression (19). When RAW 264.7 was cocultured with RenCa, there was a 10-fold increase in positive M2
marker (CD206þ/CD163þ) cells (3.8% vs. 40%;Fig. 6A). This
increase in M2 polarization was partially reversed when
RenCa/RAW 264.7 coculture was treated with BMP-6 or IL10–neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 6A). When RAW 264.7 and
hPBMC were treated directly with 100 ng/mL of BMP-6 for 3
days, there was a 4-fold increase in M2 cells (0.8% vs. 3.8% for
RAW 264.7 and 3.8% vs. 16.7% for hPBMC; Fig. 6B). The
induction of M2 polarization by BMP-6 was again partially
inhibited by anti-IL-10 antibody.
Adoptive transfer of macrophages
Although BMP-6 activates macrophages and induces the
expression of type I proinﬂammatory cytokines including IL-6
and IL-1b (29, 34). Results of the present study suggest that
the immunosuppressive effect of IL-10 seems to overcome the
proinﬂammatory effects of IL-6 and IL-1b and mediates the
overriding biologic effect of BMP-6 that results in tumor
growth in RCC. Therefore, the disruption of IL-10 production

Figure 5. A, RAW 264.7 was treated with BMP-6 (100 ng/mL) and immunoblot was carried out. The results showed a dramatic increase in phosphorylated
STAT3 within 15 minutes (0.25 hour) of BMP-6 treatment. B, inhibition of STAT3 with WP1066 (10 mg/mL) showed the abrogation of IL-10 induction by
BMP-6 in RAW 264.7. WP1066 did not inhibit the LPS-induced IL-10 expression. C, transfection of dominant-negative STAT3 (STAT3DN) or siRNA-targeting
STAT3 blocked the induction of IL-10 by BMP-6 in RAW 264.7. The knockdown of STAT4 (siSTAT4) had no signiﬁcant effect on IL-10 mRNA.
D, when RAW 264.7 was cotransfected with either STAT3 or STAT4 and IL-10-Luc reporter and treated with BMP-6 (100 ng/mL), the overexpression of STAT3
signiﬁcantly increased IL-10 promoter activity. Interestingly, STAT4 transfection repeatedly blocked the activation of IL-10 promoter.  , statistically signiﬁcant.
E, ChIP assay showed that STAT3 bound to the BMP-6–responsive region (800 to 588 bp) within the IL-10 promoter in RAW 264.7. As control, exon 3 of IL10 gene was ampliﬁed. F, immunoprecipiation against STAT3 pulled down Smad5. Conversely, immunoprecipitation against Smad5 pulled down STAT3. G,
immunoprecipitation was carried out in cytosolic and nuclear fractions from RAW 264.7. Coimmunoprecipitation of Smad5 and STAT3 was observed in
the nuclear fraction. The low level of STAT3 immunoprecipitated out with Smad5 in the nucleus in the absence of BMP-6 stimulation likely reﬂects
the basal leakage of BMP-6. H, in RenCa/BMP-6 tumors, there was a signiﬁcant increase in phosphorylated levels of STAT3 and Smad5 in samples obtained
from mice with BMP-6 induction (Doxyþ). I, confocal immunoﬂuorescence microscopy revealed that both pSTAT3 and pSmad1/5 colocalized to
macrophages (F4/80þ), especially in tumors harvested from Doxy(þ) mice.

by macrophages in the context of BMP-6 may tip the balance of
local immune response in favor of inﬂammation that may lead
to the activation of host immune system and tumor regression.
To investigate this possibility, we again used the RenCa/BMP-6
tumor model in Balb/c mice following macrophage depletion
with intraperitoneal injection of clodronate liposome (Fig. 6C).
When wild-type (WT) macrophages were adoptively transferred intratumorally, the induction of BMP-6 led to a dramatic
increase in tumor growth. In contrast, the injection of IL-10KO
macrophages not only blocked the protumorigenic effect of
BMP-6 but also decreased the rate of tumor growth signiﬁ-

cantly. The modest level of IL-10 detected in animals administered clodronate liposome is likely due to the recovery of
native macrophages by the end of the experiment. Hematoxylin staining showed a dramatic increase in neutrophil inﬁltration and necrosis in tumors injected with IL-10KO macrophages (Fig. 6D).

Figure 6. A, ﬂow cytometry showed M2 polarization (CD206þ or CD163þ) when RAW 264.7 was cocultured with RenCa. This M2 polarization was reversed partially
when the cells were treated with neutralizing antibodies to either BMP-6 or IL-10.  , statistically signiﬁcant. B, RAW 264.7 and hPBMC were treated with BMP-6 (100
ng/mL). Flow cytometry again showed a dramatic increase in M2 polarization of both cell types. This increase in M2 fraction induced by BMP-6 was blocked
partially by IL-10–neutralizing antibodies.  , statistically signiﬁcant. C, endogenous TAMs were depleted with clodronate liposomes in 40 Balb/c mice. When
WT-macrophages (WT Mf) were injected into the tumors, induction of BMP-6 (WT/doxyþ) resulted in a dramatic increase in tumor growth rate when compared
with the control group (WT/doxy). In contrast, the adoptive transfer of macrophages derived from IL-10KO mice led to a signiﬁcant decrease in tumor
growth with or without BMP-6 induction; however, BMP-6 induction resulted in the most signiﬁcant decrease in tumor growth rate. RT-PCR showed a decreased
IL-10 mRNA level in the IL-10KO macrophages group (IL-10KO Mf). The low level of IL-10 expression detected in the IL-10KOMf/Doxyþ group reﬂects the
repopulation of tumors by endogenous macrophages as clodronate liposome was injected only once at the beginning of the experiment. D, hematoxylin
staining showed an increase in neutrophil inﬁltration and tumor necrosis when IL-10KO Mfs were adoptively transferred into tumors overexpressing BMP-6.

IL-10, and CD206 is shown in Fig. 7A. Confocal immunoﬂuorescence microscopy revealed that in samples that were BMP6–positive, CD68, IL-10, and CD206 frequently colocalized (Fig.
7B). When each marker was analyzed individually in the
context of tumor stage, grade, and size, only CD68 and
BMP-6 correlated with grade, whereas BMP-6 was associated
with stage (Supplementary Fig. S5A). When cumulative
survival rate was examined, higher tumor stage and grade
were associated with poor prognosis (Supplementary Fig.
S5B and S5C); this conﬁrms the validity of our samples.
Subsequent analysis of the 4 markers failed to show any

association with outcome (Supplementary Fig. S5D). However, when each of the 4 markers were examined collectively
or in various combinations, being positive for 3 markers
(BMP-6, CD68, and IL-10) was associated with decreased
cumulative survival (Fig. 7C); CD206 status did not add any
further prognostic value. Next, a multivariate Cox analysis
showred that the 3-marker signature (BMP-6/CD68/IL-10)
was an independent predictor of cumulative survival (Supplementary Table S2). When ELISA was carried out with
serum banked from 56 patients, BMP-6 levels were not high
enough for detection. However, IL-10 serum level more than

Figure 7. A, examples of human clear cell RCC specimens that were positive by immunohistochemistry for BMP-6, IL-10, macrophages (CD68þ), and M2
polarization (CD206) are shown. B, confocal immunoﬂuorescence microscopy was used to colocalize BMP-6, IL-10, macrophages (CD68þ), and M2
polarization (CD206þ) in human RCC tissues. BMP-6 and IL-10 frequently colocalized with CD68. C, the prognostic value of BMP-6, CD68, IL-10, and
CD206 was studied in 124 patients with clear cell RCC using Kaplan–Meier analysis. Having the 3-marker signature (BMP-6/CD68/IL-10) was associated with
a decreased cumulative survival. D, serum levels of IL-10 were correlated with the rate of 5-year metastasis in 56 patients with clear cell RCC. In
patients with IL-10 serum levels more than 1 pg/mL, there was a signiﬁcantly higher rate of metastasis (P ¼ 0.022). E, proposed model for BMP-60 s
protumorigenic effect in RCC. BMP-6 produced by tumor activates TAMs and induces the type II cytokine IL-10 expression via Smad5 and STAT3 interaction.
IL-10, then, induces M2 polarization of TAMs and suppresses the local antitumor immune response, thus leading to tumor proliferation and progression.

1 pg/mL was associated with an increased incidence of
metastasis over a 5-year period (Fig. 7D).
Taken together, we propose that clear cell RCC–derived
BMP-6 stimulates the expression of the anti-inﬂammatory type
II cytokine IL-10 in TAMs via a physical interaction between
Smad5 and STAT3. IL-10, in turn, induces M2 polarization of
TAMs and suppresses the local antitumor immune response
(Fig. 7E).

Discussion
Because many types of solid tumors have elevated expression levels of BMPs, it has been proposed that BMPs may be
oncogenic (35). Consistent with this hypothesis, we have
observed that the overexpression of BMP-6 has a protumorigenic effect in 2 murine RCC cell lines. This oncogenic activity
of BMP-6 though, was seen only in vivo, suggesting that BMP-6
stimulates RCC proliferation via a paracrine mechanism.
Common paracrine mechanisms of carcinogenesis include
immunomodulation and angiogenesis. Results of the present

3612

Cancer Res; 73(12) June 15, 2013

study showed that BMP-6 stimulates TAMs to produce IL-10, a
type II cytokine that suppresses inﬂammation (36). The induction of IL-10 by BMP-6 was associated with M2 polarization of
macrophages. This observation is consistent with the report
that IL-10 induces M2 polarization of macrophages (14).
Because M2 macrophages have poor antigen-presenting
capacity and suppress T-cell activity (35), the protumorigenic
effect of BMP-6 is likely mediated by IL-10–induced M2 polarization of TAMs. Indeed, the removal of either macrophages or
IL-10 reversed the protumorigenic effect of BMP-6. In short,
these results suggest that BMP-6 induces tumor growth by
altering the tumor microenvironment in favor of anti-inﬂammation and local immune suppression. The possibility remains
though that BMP-6 may also induce angiogenesis via a yet-tobe identiﬁed mechanism.
In the context of IL-10KO mice, BMP-6 induction resulted in
a dramatic tumor regression. Because these mice developed no
tumors when rechallenged, BMP-6 induces antitumor immune
response in the absence of IL-10. Mechanistically, we have

BMP-6 Induces M2 Polarization of Macrophages in RCC

observed that BMP-6 also induces the expression of the
proinﬂammatory type I cytokines IL-6 and IL-1b in macrophages (29, 34). Accordingly, in the absence of IL-10 acting as a
counterweight, the balance of the effect of BMP-6 in vivo may
be skewed toward inﬂammation and antitumor response.
Consistent with this concept, the adoptive transfer of macrophages from IL-10KO mice retarded BMP-6–induced tumor
growth. Therefore, blocking IL-10 may be an effective therapy
in a subgroup of patients with RCC with dysregulated BMP-6/
IL-10.
Canonical BMP signaling requires a heterotetrameric complex of type I and II receptors. To date, 3 each of type I and II
receptors have been reported (37). Although these receptors
are promiscuous, there is an optimal receptor combination for
each BMP as it has been shown that there are coreceptors that
are relatively speciﬁc for BMP-2 and -4 (38). In the context of
BMP-6/IL-10, BMP-RII, along with ALK2 and 3, efﬁciently
transduced BMP-6 signal. Whether there is a BMP-6–speciﬁc
coreceptor remains to be studied.
Intracellularly, both Smad5 and STAT3 are necessary for IL10 induction by BMP-6. ChIP showed that both Smad5 and
STAT3 bind to the same region within the IL-10 promoter.
Because the IL-10 promoter contains STAT3 but not a consensus Smad-binding element, it is likely that STAT3 interacts
directly with the DNA, whereas Smad5 is a cofactor for the
transcriptional activation of IL-10 by BMP-6. Further studies
are necessary to verify this concept.
In patients with clear cell RCC, BMP-6, CD68, IL-10, and
CD206 had no prognostic value individually. This observation
is consistent with the report that BMP-6 in clear cell RCC
tissues does not predict outcome (12). Notwithstanding,
patients who had the 3-marker signature composed of BMP6, CD68, and IL-10 were more likely to die from RCC. Interestingly though, CD206 (M2 macrophages) did not add any
further prognostic value. This is likely due to colinearity as the
presence of IL-10 and macrophages (CD68) were consistently
associated with CD206. These observations suggest that the
effect of BMP-6 in RCC is dictated by the tumor microenvironment and that IL-10 may be a surrogate marker of the
protumorigenic effect of BMP-6.
Results of the present study implicate IL-10 as a new
biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in RCC. Specifically, elevated serum levels of IL-10 were associated with
increased risk of metastatic RCC. On the therapeutic front,
an adoptive transfer of IL-10KO macrophages resulted in a
dramatic tumor regression. Therefore, serum IL-10 levels may

eventually be used to identify patients who are best candidates
for targeting BMP-6/IL-10 loop. We are planning to test this
concept in patients with clear cell RCC using AS101, a smallmolecule inhibitor of IL-10 (39).
It should be pointed out that elevated tissue levels of IL-10
mRNA have been correlated with poor prognosis in patients
with RCC (40). Herein though, IL-10 alone did not predict
outcome. The underlying reason for this difference is unclear.
Possible explanations include the different methodologies
used to detect IL-10—immunohistochemistry versus RT-PCR.
Further studies are needed to clarify this discrepancy.
In conclusion, BMP-6 is protumorigenic in RCC. This oncogenic effect of BMP-6 is mediated by macrophage-derived IL10, which leads to M2 polarization of TAMs. At the molecular
level, BMP-6 induces IL-10 expression in macrophages via a
direct interaction between STAT3 and Smad5 in the nucleus. In
patients with clear cell RCC, the 3-marker signature BMP-6/
CD68/IL-10 predicted decreased cumulative survival after
surgery, whereas elevated serum IL-10 levels were associated
with increased risk of metastasis. Taken together, these results
show a novel mechanism of M2 polarization of TAMs in RCC
that involves the BMP-6/IL-10 axis and provides the proof-ofprinciple for developing a personalized immunotherapy based
on serum IL-10 level.
