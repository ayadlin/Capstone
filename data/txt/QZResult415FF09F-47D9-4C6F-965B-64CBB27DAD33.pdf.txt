Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive, metastatic
disease with limited treatment options. Factors contributing to the metastatic
predisposition and therapy resistance in pancreatic cancer are not well understood.
Here, we used a mouse model of KRAS-driven pancreatic carcinogenesis to
define distinct subtypes of PDAC metastasis: epithelial, mesenchymal and quasimesenchymal. We examined pro-survival signals in these cells and the therapeutic
response differences between them. Our data indicate that the initiation and
maintenance of the transformed state are separable, and that KRAS dependency is
not a fundamental constant of KRAS-initiated tumors. Moreover, some cancer cells
can shuttle between the KRAS dependent (drug-sensitive) and independent (drugtolerant) states and thus escape extinction. We further demonstrate that inhibition
of KRAS signaling alone via co-targeting the MAPK and PI3K pathways fails to induce
extensive tumor cell death and, therefore, has limited efficacy against PDAC. However,
the addition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors greatly improves outcomes,
reduces the self-renewal of cancer cells, and blocks cancer metastasis in vivo.
Our results suggest that targeting HDACs in combination with KRAS or its effector
pathways provides an effective strategy for the treatment of PDAC.

Introduction

revealed an average of ~45 mutations per tumor, three
to six of which are driver gene mutations, while the
remaining are passenger mutations that confer no survival
advantage [3-6]. The four most frequent mutations in
PDAC include KRAS (>90%), CDKN2A (>90%), TP53
(~70%), and SMAD4 (~50%), which are considered
to be founder mutations and have been implicated in
the metastatic process [3-6]. Pancreatic cancers with
high metastatic capacity are further subdivided into two
genetic groups: KRAS/TP53 double mutant and KRAS/
TP53/SMAD4 triple mutant. These mutations are thought
to arise sequentially, resulting in the development of
increasingly aggressive cancer phenotypes [7, 8]. Even
with this genetic information, unanswered questions
remain about critical drivers of metastatic progression, and
whether some driver mutations make metastatic cancer a
certainty and render it less responsive to treatment. Given
the increasing recognition that pancreatic cancers tend to

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the most
common form of pancreatic cancer, is a highly aggressive
disease characterized by an insidious onset and low
survival rate. About 80% of patients with PDAC present
with locally advanced or metastatic disease [1, 2]. The
two main obstacles in the treatment of PDAC are late
diagnosis and therapy resistance of the tumor. The efficacy
of therapies in metastatic cancer is further limited by
frequent acquisition of multidrug resistance. Most patients
with metastatic pancreatic cancer are considered incurable
and rarely survive more than one year [1, 2]. The origins
of pancreatic cancer, the feasibility of early detection, and
the identity of genes and pathways responsible for the
acquisition of malignant (metastatic) phenotype have yet
to be determined.

spread early [9], there is an urgent need to quantitatively
assess therapy resistance and site-specific outgrowth of
disseminated cells. Only with this knowledge will we be
able to combat the disease.
These goals have previously been challenging
because of the difficulty of detecting small tumor cell
populations. To overcome this limitation, we developed a
genetically tractable in vitro model system to investigate
the origins and evolution of pancreatic cancer cells. As
a proof of concept, we isolated the main epithelial cell
types from which PDAC originates and characterized
their propensity to form metastases [10, 11]. In this
study, we explore the relative importance of oncogenic
KRAS signaling pathways for tumor maintenance and
in conferring therapy resistance. Our analysis reveals
that oncogenic KRAS dependency can be relinquished in
KRAS-initiated tumors, and that some cancer cells can
shuttle between the KRAS-dependent (drug-sensitive) and
independent (drug-tolerant) states. We further demonstrate
that therapeutic targeting of KRAS signaling alone has
limited efficacy against PDAC. However, clinically
available drugs, used at clinically achievable doses,
can be effective against PDAC when co-administered
with epigenetic modifiers, such as inhibitors of histone
deacetylases. Our data suggest that targeting HDACs in
combination with KRAS effector pathways provides an
effective strategy for the treatment of PDAC.

1A, B). Class B cell lines (CLB) are adenocarcinomas
exhibiting a pure epithelial morphology and the
EpCAM+CD24+CD44+CD133+ phenotype (Fig. 1A,
B). Class C carcinomas (CLC) are morphologically
heterogeneous
and
comprise
interconvertible
EpCAM+CD133+ epithelial and EpCAM-CD133mesenchymal cells (Fig. 1A, 1B). Based on these
features, class C tumors represent reversible epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT). Western blot analysis
confirmed that CLA carcinomas were Vimentin (VIM)
positive, KRT19/CDH1 negative, while CLB carcinomas
were VIM negative, KRT19/CDH1 positive (Fig. 1C).
Injection of CLA, CLB or CLC cell lines into nude
mice led to the development of tumors maintaining the
histological appearance of their parental neoplasms (Fig.
1A). CLB clones are representative of the predominant
form of human metastatic PDAC [12] and hence we
focused our analysis mainly on this cell type.

Oncogenic KRAS signaling in primary and
metastatic PDAC
Signaling through the RAS/MAPK and
PI3K pathways plays a causative role in pancreatic
carcinogenesis [1, 2]. To assess the contribution of these
pathways to PDAC maintenance, we evaluated the growth
of the different subtypes in defined serum-free medium
for epithelial cells, in the presence of exogenous growth
factors, or under non-adherent culture conditions that
mimic cancer cell dissemination [10]. Analysis confirmed
that the KRAS oncogene activates the MAPK signaling
(as assessed by phosphorylated ERK1/2) and PI3K/PDK1
signaling (as assessed by phosphorylated PDK1), but not
PI3K/AKT signaling (Fig. 1C). Addition of various growth
factors further potentiated MAPK/ERK signaling, and
activated AKT in epithelial type CLB carcinomas, but not
in mesenchymal type CLA carcinomas (Fig. S2). Similar
analysis of human PDAC cell lines also revealed robust
phosphorylation of PDK1, but only weak phosphorylation
of AKT (AKT-T308 and AKT-S473) (Fig. 1D and Fig.
S2). These data suggest that PI3K/PDK1-mediated
signaling may play an AKT-independent role in mediating
the effects of oncogenic KRAS in pancreatic cancer. We
also noted the absence of conspicuous ERK activation in
three out of six KRAS mutant PDAC cell lines (CFPAC1,
MiaPaCa2 and PANC1) when cultured in serum-free
conditions, suggesting that in these cells KRAS oncogenes
may no longer maintain their proliferation (Fig. 1D). These
results align with previously published data showing that
PDAC cell lines harboring KRAS mutations can differ in
their dependence on oncogenic KRAS [13-15]. They also
help explain why PDAC progression is strongly aided
by elements of the tumor microenvironment, including
growth factors and cytokines [16-18]. However, the core

morphological and phenotypic heterogeneity
Using genetically engineered mice carrying
KRAS and p53 mutations, we recently identified two
main epithelial cell types from which PDAC originates
and characterized their propensity to form metastases
[10, 11]. The population of less mature cells bears the
phenotype of EpCAM+CD24+CD44+SCA1- (referred to
as SCA1-) that distinguishes them from a more mature
population of EpCAM+CD24+CD44+CD133+SCA1+
cells (referred to as SCA1+) (Fig. S1). The majority of
tumors derived from SCA1- cells showed features of
undifferentiated (sarcomatoid) carcinoma, whereas the
histology of tumors derived from SCA1+ cells exhibited
a pattern of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (Fig. S1).
To explore factors contributing to PDAC heterogeneity
and therapeutic outcomes, we established clonal cell lines
from the respective metastatic foci. The cell lines were
assessed for the expression of pancreatic duct specific
genes (PDX1, KRT19) and epithelial cell markers
(EpCAM, CDH1, CD133). We categorized the cell
lines into three groups. Class A cell lines (referred to as
CLA) are the pure spindle cell carcinomas exhibiting the

valid therapeutic targets for the treatment of PDAC, and
these are maintained in our cell system.

carcinomas (Fig. 3A). In contrast, ≥10% of CLA and CLC
carcinoma cells remained viable regardless of the intensity
or duration of treatment (Fig. S5). Likewise, combined
MEK and PI3K inhibition only modestly diminished the
viability of the suspended (dormant) tumor cells (Fig. S5).
These findings indicated that inhibition of these two KRAS
effector pathways was insufficient to cause extensive cell
death and prompted us to investigate additional treatment
options.
To that end, we treated our cells grown either
in 2D or 3D conditions with MEK/PI3K inhibitors in
combination with more than 20 other drugs directed
against known KRAS effectors, such as the RAF/
MAPK, SAPK/JNK and PDK1/AKT pathways, as well
as other targets, such as DNA methyltransferases, BET
bromodomains and histone deacetylases (Fig. S4). From all
of these drugs, PDAC cell lines were found to be acutely
susceptible to a MEK/PI3K/HDAC inhibitor combination
(Fig. 3A). Thus, combined inhibition of MEK and PI3K
decreased proliferation by less than 90%, with only mild
induction of cell death. In contrast, combined blockade
of MEK/PI3K/HDAC inhibited proliferation by >99%
with massive apoptosis (Fig. 3A and Fig. S4). Intermittent
treatment with low doses of these drugs further reduced
cell survival, as only a small minority of tumor cells
(~10-5) resumed proliferation after drug withdrawal (Fig.
3B, C). These findings align with previous data showing
that HDAC inhibitors are able to induce apoptosis in
multiple cell types, and that pharmacological inhibition
of the MAPK and PI3K pathways enhances the apoptotic
effects of HDAC inhibition [20-22]. Among the tested
compounds, the strongest cytotoxic effects were obtained
with GSK1120212, BEZ235 and trichostatin A (TSA).
This drug combination was equally effective in killing
proliferating and non-proliferating (dormant) cells (Fig.
3D, 3E), and importantly, cancer cells were more sensitive
to drug-induced cell death than normal cells (Fig. 3F).
We therefore used this drug combination as a tool to
investigate the resistance mechanism(s) of KRAS mutant
cancer cells and the feasibility of targeted therapies for
pancreatic cancer.
We extended these analyses to a panel of
human PDAC cell lines that contain activating KRAS
mutations but vary in their KRAS dependency [13, 14].
Combinations of MEK and PI3K inhibitors exhibited
marked cytostatic but not cytotoxic effects on all cell
lines tested. On the other hand, addition of TSA induced
extensive apoptosis in KRAS-dependent AsPC1, HPAFII
and BxPC3 cell lines but not in KRAS-independent
CFPAC1, MiaPaCa2 and PANC1 cell lines, which were
resistant to the induction of cell death even at high
concentrations of the drugs (Fig. S6). We also evaluated
the effects of inhibitors in a panel of eight human lung
cancer cell lines. Four of these cell lines (H23, H358,
H727 and A549) have activating KRAS mutations, while
other cell lines contain wild-type KRAS and are not

An in vitro system to study tumor dormancy and
the switch to metastatic growth
To mimic cancer cells when they disseminate, we
used a 3D non-adherent culture system. An outstanding
feature of pancreatic cancer cell lines is their ability to
exist in suspension as sphere-like clusters (CLA and CLC
carcinomas) or epithelial sheets (CLB carcinomas) (Fig.
2A). These non-adherent conditions shift them to a nonproliferative dormant state, in which they exist for long
periods of time (≥1 month) without loss of viability (Fig.
2B, 2C). These changes are coupled with the suppression
of MAPK/ERK and SMAD2/3 signaling, yet PI3K/
PDK1 signaling is unperturbed (Fig. 2D and Fig. S3).
Phosphorylation of RAF1 at S338, which is a critical
step in ERK activation, is inhibited in suspended cancer
cells (Fig. 2E). Constitutively active RAF1 (RAF22W)
and BRAF (BRAFV600E) were both capable to rescue
activation of ERK in non-adherent conditions (Fig. 2E).
However, even with forced activation of RAF and ERK
in suspended cells we were unable to relieve MYC downregulation and cell growth inhibition (Fig. 2E). Thus,
suspension not only inhibits RAF1, but also MAPK
signaling downstream of ERK. This dormant state was
reversible, as cells from suspensions could readily attach
to an appropriate surface and reacquire their malignant
phenotype characterized by the persistent activation of the
MAPK/ERK/MYC signaling cascade (Fig. 2F and Fig.
S3). Hence, we conclude that the growth of pancreatic
cancer cells in vitro can be suspended (although not
completely abrogated) through loss of cell attachment or
combined MAPK/ERK/MYC inhibition.

PDAC cells are acutely susceptible to a MEK/
PI3K/HDAC inhibitor combination
The above findings led us to assess the therapeutic
value of blocking MAPK and PI3K signaling in pancreatic
tumor cells. To identify optimal therapeutic strategies, we
first screened our tumor cell lines for growth inhibition
and cell death after exposure to chemical inhibitors of
MEK (PD0325901 and GSK1120212), PI3K (BEZ235
and GDC0941), PDK1 (OSU03012), and AKT (MK2206)
at clinically achievable doses of ~ 0.1 μM. Treatment
with an inhibitor of a single pathway, e.g. MAPK, led to
enhancement of other pathways, as noted by others [19]
(Fig. S4). Combined targeting of MEK and PI3K blocked
the activation of both the MAPK and PI3K pathways and
caused growth inhibition and cell death more effectively
than any of the other treatments (Fig. 3A). The cells
most susceptible to the induction of apoptosis were CLB

Combined MEK/PI3K/HDAC inhibition prevents
lung metastasis in vivo

RAS-activated (Fig. S6). We found that all lung cancer
cells with mutant KRAS were sensitive to BEZ/GSK/
TSA inhibition (Fig. S6). Moreover, the addition of TSA
induced apoptosis in KRAS-mutant cell lines but not in
KRAS wild-type EBC1, PC9, H1650, or HCC366 cell
lines, which were less strongly affected (Fig. S6). These
data indicate the BEZ/GSK/TSA inhibitor combination
is selectively toxic to KRAS-dependent cancer cell lines,
regardless of tumor cell type.

We tested the combinations of GSK1120212,
BEZ235 and TSA for their potential to suppress metastasis
in vivo. Nude mice were injected intravenously with 2 x
104 CLB carcinoma cells. Two weeks after the injection of
tumor cells, mice were treated daily for 7 days with vehicle
or drugs at doses of 1 mg/kg/day and sacrificed 4 weeks
later. Earlier work has determined that as few as 104 cells
were sufficient to induce lung tumors within 4 weeks after
injection [10]. The chosen drug doses were on the low
end of effective when used alone or in combination with

other drugs (~2 mg/kg daily for GSK1120212; ~40 mg/
kg for BEZ235; ~10 mg/kg for TSA) [23-25]. Multiplicity
of lung metastatic foci was then determined for each
group of mice. Vehicle-treated mice had an average of
10±2 metastatic foci in the lungs per mouse, while mice
that received the two drug combination of BEZ/GSK had
an average of 8.1±1.7 foci in the lungs (Fig. 4A, 4B). In
contrast, there were no observable metastases in mice
treated with the BEZ/GSK/TSA inhibitor combination
(Fig. 4A, 4B). There were early concerns about possible
toxicity of the triple-drug regimen, as MEK and PI3K
inhibitors both induce skin rash. As expected, the common
side effects associated with dual MEK/PI3K inhibition
were skin rash and acneiform eruptions. Remarkably,
however, administration of TSA alleviated these adverse
effects as we noted no weight loss, toxicity or other side
effects during BEZ/GSK/TSA treatment. These results
imply that combination therapy with BEZ/GSK/TSA can
reduce or prevent cancer metastasis in an in vivo model
system, and that the drug combination is likely to be
reasonably tolerated.

of these drug-tolerant cells had also lost activation of at
least one of the two pathways (i.e., MAPK and PI3K)
and had less than half of control levels of MYC (Fig.
5B). Gene expression data from public databases (http://
www.broadinstitute.org/gsea) were compared to identify
gene expression signatures predictive of response to drugs
targeting MEK and PI3K, as well as the response to TSA.
The genes regulated by RAS/MAPK and PI3K signaling
did not overlap with TSA responsive genes, suggesting
that MEK, PI3K and HDAC inhibitors do not act similarly
on gene expression. However, we observed a modest but
significant overlap among MYC target genes and TSA
responsive genes, suggesting that TSA may antagonize
MYC function (Fig. S8), consistent with the low levels
of MYC protein observed after the triple drug treatment.
In sum, these drug-tolerant residual cells shunted into an
alternative pathway by activating (or repressing) genes that
regulate cell survival, differentiation, and transformation.
Because differentiation into cells with mesenchymallike phenotypes was evident in all cases, we reasoned that
the persistent presence of this mesenchymal phenotype
is consistent with a non-mutational, and therefore,
possibly reversible mechanism of drug tolerance. Indeed,
it was reported that proliferating drug-tolerant cells
can be drug-sensitized by drug-free passaging [26]. We
found that drug-tolerant cells propagated in drug-free
media reacquired their original drug sensitivity after
≥30 population doublings. The drug-tolerant phenotype
was relinquished due to the reacquisition of KRAS
dependency combined with the hypersensitivity to growth
factors (e.g., IGF1), as judged by ERK phosphorylation
(Fig. 5D). Notably, consecutive treatment cycles, each
followed by a recovery period of 1 month, showed that
similar proportions of tumor of cells were killed with each
treatment cycle (Fig. 5E). Thus, transient MEK/PI3K/
HDAC inhibition does not cause resistance to pathwaytargeted drugs. However, small populations of cancer cells
can shuttle between the KRAS dependent (drug-sensitive)
and independent (drug-tolerant) states and thus escape
extinction.

Transient inhibition of MEK/PI3K/HDAC activity
prevents the development of drug resistance
Acquired drug resistance is a major problem in
cancer therapy. To investigate whether transient inhibition
of MEK/PI3K/HDAC activity can lead to the development
of drug resistance, we adopted a short-term (2-day)
treatment with the drugs (BEZ/GSK/TSA), followed by
a recovery period of 1 month. Longer treatment resulted
in almost complete elimination of CLB carcinoma cells.
We consistently observed that the surviving populations
produced slowly proliferating progeny that resembled
dormant cells. While the majority of drug-tolerant cells
originating from CLA carcinomas retained their aggressive
tumorigenic phenotype (Fig. 4C), all drug-tolerant cells
originating from CLB carcinomas were markedly distinct
from the parental cells, as they lost their epithelial
morphology, assuming the features of EMT, and were less
tumorigenic compared with controls upon subcutaneous
or tail vein injection (Fig. 4D, 4E and Fig. S7). Allelespecific PCR revealed the presence of the mutant (but not
of the WT) KRAS allele in all surviving clones examined
(Fig. 5A). KRAS expression levels remained essentially
unchanged in all of the treatments (Fig. 5B and Fig. S8).
However, RAF1 and PI3KCB protein levels were 1020% of those in untreated controls (Fig. 5B and Fig. S8).
The catalytically active, phosphorylated forms of ERK,
PDK1 and AKT were reduced accordingly (Fig. 5B and
Fig. S8). Most strikingly, these drug-tolerant cells were
able to proliferate and grow into tumors in the absence
of RAS-induced stabilization of MYC (Fig. 5B, 5C).
In a separate screen, we examined drug-tolerant clones
arising from CLA carcinomas. We found that nearly all

Drug tolerance is randomly acquired by
individual cells within the population
The above data imply either that a population
of rare pre-existing cells with KRAS independencyconferring mutations can outgrow drug-sensitive cells,
or that the drug-tolerant phenotype can emerge de novo
in individual cells within the population. To distinguish
between these possibilities, we measured phenotypic
switching in CLB carcinoma cells that were treated with
the combinations of two (BEZ/GSK) or three drugs
(BEZ/GSK/TSA). We found that drug-tolerant cells
with mesenchymal differentiation but no identifiable
epithelial features accumulated gradually, after two

weeks of the treatment, with varying efficiencies for
two different drug regimens (Fig. S8). We next analyzed
phenotypic conversion of individual cells. To that end,
CLB carcinoma cells were treated with the GSK/BEZ/
TSA inhibitor combination and, after 10 days of recovery,
single-cell sorted by FACS based on EpCAM-positive
enrichment. At 4 weeks post treatment, we scored 55%
of clones as mostly epithelial (EpCAM-positive), 15%
as mostly mesenchymal (EpCAM-negative) and 30% as
bi-phenotypic (Fig. S9). The preponderance of epithelial
or mixed-lineage survivors in this set of experiments is
explained by the adopted mild treatment regimen. In sum,
although we cannot rigorously exclude the possibility that
rare pre-existing mutant cells acquire and then relinquish
their KRAS-independent phenotype, our results suggest
that KRAS mutant cells can be reprogrammed, at least in
vitro, and that the process of drug-induced reprogramming
can temporarily reduce or abolish their oncogenic KRAS
dependency.

tissue restricted [29], it is tempting to speculate that the
dependency of mutant KRAS tumors on MYC function
can be circumvented by alternative modules rather than
single genes. It was reported that activation of the PI3K
pathway [30], loss of CDKN2A [31], or amplifications of
the genomic locus containing YAP1, a downstream target
in the Hippo signaling pathway and an activator of the
AP1 and E2F transcriptional programs, enable bypass of
KRAS addiction [32, 33]. However, in our drug-tolerant
cells we found no evidence of up-regulation (stabilization)
and nuclear accumulation of YAP1, AP1 (FOS and
JUN) or E2Fs (E2F1, E2F3, E2F4) (Fig. 5B). CDKN2A
expression also remained unchanged (Fig. 5B), suggesting
the presence of alternative mechanisms, which lead to a
phenotype reminiscent of dormancy, drive recurrent
colony formation upon removal of the drugs, and which
involve reversible activation and inactivation of three
known pathways (MAPK, PI3K, SMAD) under conditions
of drug-induced stress.

Dormancy is a plausible mechanism of drug
tolerance in cancer cell populations

Discussion
The mutated KRAS oncogene is found in
approximately 90% of cases of PDAC, and generally
in about 30% of human cancers [34]. There has been a
strong effort to devise strategies targeting KRAS itself
or pathways downstream. Although this approach has
an immense potential, no successful therapy for treating
KRAS-driven cancers has emerged recently. One of the
problems with anticancer drugs is their toxicity and narrow
therapeutic window. Another is the genetic and phenotypic
heterogeneity common to most human cancers. This
heterogeneity affects the signaling pathways involved in
tumor growth and poses a formidable challenge for cancer
treatment [34]. Recently, it was discovered that tumors
with KRAS mutations can differ in their dependence on
oncogenic KRAS [13, 14]. It follows that, while targeting
KRAS or its effector pathways provides a rational
mechanism-based approach, a reasonable alternative is to
identify pathways that are not directly regulated by KRAS
but whose inactivation is lethal in cancer cells that harbor
mutant KRAS. The main objective of this study was to
explore cell-autonomous vulnerabilities of pancreatic
cancer cells with KRAS mutations and identify treatments
that kill these cells rather than stop or slow down their
growth. Based on our findings we propose that combined
targeting of HDACs and key KRAS effector pathways
(MEK and PI3K) provides an effective strategy for
targeting PDAC.
Our data indicate that therapeutic targeting of
KRAS signaling alone via inhibition of the MAPK and
PI3K pathways has limited efficacy against PDAC, as it
induces cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effects. Because
many ongoing trials have adopted co-targeting the KRASmediated MAPK and PI3K signaling as the prevalent
therapeutic approach, we have explored cancer-specific

Our results show that therapeutic targeting of KRAS
signaling via inhibition of MAPK/PI3K pathways has
limited efficacy against PDAC metastasis. The addition of
HDAC inhibitors improves the outcome by a factor of at
least 100, and just as importantly, only a small proportion
of cancer cells (~0.001%) retain the ability to self-renew.
Further improving treatment efficacy and safety requires
understanding how HDAC and MEK/PI3K inhibition
interact to produce a lethal effect, or possibly how HDAC
inhibitors change the state of the cells, such that they
become more vulnerable to KRAS inhibition. To address
these questions, we assessed gene expression profiles
of untreated controls, stressed cells (ST), which were
exposed either to TSA or combinations of two (BEZ/GSK)
or three drugs (BEZ/GSK/TSA), and drug-tolerant cells
(DT) that resumed proliferation after drug treatment (Fig.
5B). Analysis of stressed cells revealed acute changes
in the MAPK/ERK, PI3K/PDK1 and TGFB/SMAD
signaling modules mentioned above (Fig. 5B). Likewise,
drug-tolerant cells showed reduced expression of RAF1,
BRAF, TBR2, the ERBB family of receptors and MYC
(Fig. 5B), suggesting that alterations at these nodes could
play a protective role under conditions that are lethal to the
majority of the population. We found that the combined use
of MEK/PI3K and HDAC inhibitors enhances apoptosis,
as evidenced by induction of CASP3 activation and PARP
cleavage (Fig. 5F). Moreover, the strong MYC, SOX9, and
EGFR effects can also be attributed to the addition of TSA
(Fig. 5B). Given that there are no functional equivalents
of the myc family of proto-oncogenes that can substitute
for MYC in control of cell proliferation and malignant
transformation [27, 28], and that N-MYC expression is

vulnerabilities associated with epigenetic deregulation.
We have investigated the effects of potent MEK inhibitors,
such as GSK1120212, the PI3K inhibitors, such as
BEZ235, and the HDAC inhibitors, such as TSA, on cell
viability and apoptosis induction in metastatic PDAC
cell lines maintained in 2D culture (i.e. monolayers in
tissue culture), 3D culture (i.e. spheroids in suspension)
or in vivo as tumor xenografts. Because of their relative
specificity toward cancer cells, HDAC inhibitors represent
a class of cancer treatment agents that are reasonably
well tolerated [35]. The data from our proof-of-principle
experiments suggest that targeting HDACs in combination
with the major KRAS effector pathways provides an
effective strategy for targeting PDAC. Overall, these
data indicate that the epigenetic changes established in
KRAS mutant cancers makes them insensitive to killing
by RAS pathway inhibitors, while disrupting the balance
between acetylation and deacetylation sensitizes them to
the treatment. The triple drug combination was found to
be effective in vivo in suppressing metastatic growth while
exhibiting no apparent toxic effects compared with the less
effective two drug combination. Our study explicitly set
out to model clinically relevant drug exposures. Although
caution is warranted in extrapolating these results to
the human disease insofar as there is no corroborating
clinical evidence, the results from this study establish a
new paradigm for pancreatic cancer treatment. The results
emphasize the potential utility of therapeutic regimens
that target the epigenetic state of cancer cells. Questions
remain about the type of cell death mechanisms and
possible improvement of the treatment.
Genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC have
demonstrated that continuous KRAS signaling is required
for both progression and maintenance of PDAC [36-38].
However, preclinical trials in mice indicate that while
suppression of KRAS signaling prevents tumor initiation
and progression, it fails to eradicate established tumors
[34, 39]. Our results align with previously published
data showing a strong link between tumor cell dormancy,
various degrees of EMT and KRAS independence [13, 32,
33]. Our data also imply that the survivors that remain
are those rare cells in the population that stochastically
move away from dependency on the KRAS activity and
gain a growth advantage when the cancer is targeted by
the drug combination. The dormant nature of drug-tolerant
cells that emerge after the combination drug treatment is
supported by their ability to reversibly inactivate MAPK
and PI3K signaling under conditions of drug-induced
stress. We estimate that pancreatic cancer cells bearing
KRAS mutation can maintain the KRAS “independent”
phenotype for ≥ 30 population doublings. According to
these estimates, each cancer cell will generate ≥ 230 (i.e.
~109) of KRAS-independent offspring. Considering that
a tumor reaching the size of 1 cm3 is commonly assumed
to contain 109 cells or less, this points to the fact that the
KRAS-independent phenotype is durable and strong. We
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

know of some genetic alterations, such as CDKN2A loss
and YAP1 amplifications [31-33], that can confer a high
degree of RAS independence and therapy resistance.
However, because these lesions can be excluded in our
system, further examination of the effect of MEK/PI3K/
HDAC inhibitors in the mesenchymal subsets of PDAC,
which are less KRAS dependent, will be important.
Notwithstanding these limitations, our results and those
reported for other cancer systems [22, 40] suggest that
the combined use of epigenetic drugs with agents that
target KRAS or its effector pathways can provide a more
effective treatment for metastatic cancer.

Materials and Methods
Mammalian cells and reagents
Parental and metastatic KrasG12D p53KO PDAC
cell lines, the latter of which were established from the
respective lung and lymph node metastatic foci, were
described previously [10, 11]. Unless otherwise specified,
cells were grown on gelatinized plates in CnT-17 media
(CellnTec). Single cell suspensions were cultured in
ultralow attachment 6-well plates (Corning) with CnT17 media. Human cell lines were cultured in RPMI or
DMEM media supplemented with 5% FBS and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin, as recommended by ATCC. For
long-term cell proliferation assays, cells were seeded
into 6-well plates (105 cells per well) and cultured both
in the absence and presence of drugs as indicated below.
Inhibitors targeting FAK (PF562271), RAF (TAK632),
IGF1R (OSI906 and GSK1904529A) (all from ApexBio),
MEK (PD0325901 and GSK1120212), PI3K (BEZ235 and
GDC0941), PDK1 (OSU03012), AKT (MK2206), HDAC
(PXD101, SAHA, TSA) (all from Selleckchem.com)
were prepared as 100 μM stocks in DMSO. Cells were
treated with various concentrations of the compounds for
3 days, followed by a 1 day drug-free recovery period,
and their proliferation was determined by Coulter counter.
For intermittent inhibition, cells were subjected to three
rounds of 3 day treatment, each followed by a 3 day drugfree period, over the course of 18 days. Cell viability
was measured using propidium iodide (PI) staining. We
used replication-defective retroviral vectors encoding
MYC, constitutively active mutants of Kras4BG12D,
RAF122W, and BRAFV600E. Recombinant retroviruses
were produced as previously described [10].

Tumorigenicity in mice
All animal studies were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at Stony Brook
University. Nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously or
into the tail vein with 104 cells in 100 μl of OPTI-MEM.

We defined tumor latencies as the period between injection
of tumorigenic cells into mice and the appearance of
tumors of ≥1 mm in diameter. The survival end point
was a tumor diameter of 1 cm. P ≤ 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Mouse tissue was harvested and
processed as described before [10]. Two pathologists
read and scored the slides independently. Treatment with
GSK1120212 (1 mg/kg), NVP-BEZ235 (10-40 mg/kg),
TSA (1-5 mg/kg) or their combination (at the same dose
as monotherapy) was started two weeks after tail vein
injection with cancer cells. For in vivo dosing, drugs were
suspended in 0.5% PEG (Sigma) and 0.2% Tween 80 in
distilled water. Drugs were administered once a day by
intraperitoneal injection for 5 consecutive days. Mice
were sacrificed and examined for the growth of metastatic
tumors 1 month after administration of drugs.

Expression analysis
For flow cytometry, cells were lifted with Accutase
(Sigma), stained with antibodies to EpCam, SCA1 (Ly6A/E), CD24, CD44, and CD133 (BD Pharmingen or
eBioscince), and analyzed using FACSCalibur (BD)
with CellQuest software. For RNA isolation, cells were
harvested with TrIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA
synthesis for qRT-PCR was performed using SuperScript
cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). PCR primers for
genotyping and detecting the WT and KrasG12D alleles
were as follows: 5’- tccaacacagatgttcttaggctac and
5’-tccgaattcagtgactacagatgtacagag. PCR products were
separated on a 2% agarose gel. Successful recombination
(single LoxP site) yields a ~340-bp product (~300-bp in
WT Kras allele). Western blotting was performed using
antibodies against PDX1 (562160, BD), CDH1 (610181,
BD), MYC (N-262, Santa Cruz), KRAS (F234), IGF1R
(C20, Santa Cruz), PDK1 (3062), P-PDK1 (S241), AKT
