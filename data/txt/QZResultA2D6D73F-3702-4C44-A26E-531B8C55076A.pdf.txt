Abstract
The marine natural chamigrane-type sesquiterpenoid, dactylone, is closely related to secondary metabolites of some
edible species of red algae. In the present study, the effect of
dactylone was tested on the mouse skin epidermal JB6 P+ Cl41
cell line and its stable transfectants as well as on several
human tumor cell lines, including lung (H460), colon (HCT116), and skin melanomas (SK-MEL-5 and SK-MEL-28). This
natural product was effective at nontoxic doses as a cancerpreventive agent, which exerted its actions, at least in part,
through the inhibition of cyclin D3 and Cdk4 expression and
retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) phosphorylation. The inhibition of these cell cycle components was
followed by cell cycle arrest at the G1-S transition with
subsequent p53-independent apoptosis. Therefore, these data
showed that application of dactylone and related compounds
may lead to decreased malignant cell transformation and/or
decreased tumor cell proliferation. [Cancer Res 2007;67(12):5914–20]

Introduction
Consumption of various types of seafood has been suggested to
be responsible for the low incidence of cancer in Japan and other
countries whose inhabitants traditionally consume high levels of
marine organisms. Many kinds of seafood are known to contain the
low molecular weight natural products, which may be found only
from these specific sources. However, a possible role of the
secondary metabolites, besides fatty acids, from seafood (1) in this
phenomenon has been insufficiently studied.
Halogenated chamigrane sesquiterpenoids represent a characteristic group of marine natural products that may be found only in
red algae and mollusks feeding on them (2, 3). A variety of these
secondary metabolites were identified in different species of algae
belonging to the genus Laurencia, including those used as food
condiments by the Japanese, Hawaiians, and other distinct
populations. However, the anticancer properties of these compounds have not yet been examined.
Halogenated sesquiterpenoid dactylone [10-bromo-h-chamigren-4-one, IUPAC: (6S,10R)-10-bromo-3,11,11-trimethyl-7-methylidenespiro[5,5]undec-2-en-4-one; Fig. 1A] was isolated from the sea
hare Aplysia dactylomela along with two other sesquiterpenoids
(4–7). The chemical structure of the dactylone (Fig. 1A) is closely
related to the known sesquiterpenoids from Laurencia spp. (3, 8).

Here, we report the cancer-preventive properties of dactylone,
including some details regarding the molecular mechanism of this
action.

H460, colon HCT-116, and skin melanoma SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-5 cancer
cell lines were obtained by American Type Culture Collection and were
cultured in monolayers at 37jC and 5% CO2 in RPMI, McCoy’s, and MEM,
respectively, containing 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 units/mL
penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. RSK2-deficient and wild-type RSK2
human lymphoblasts were cultured at 37jC with 5% CO2 in RPMI medium
containing 20% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and
100 Ag/mL streptomycin. Information regarding the genetic background of
these cell lines is available online.3
Cell viability assay. The effect of dactylone on cell viability was
evaluated using MTS reduction into its formazan product. The JB6 P+ Cl41
mouse epidermal cell line and its stable transfectants, JB6 Cl41 dominantnegative mutant (DNM)-JNK1, DNM-p38, DNM-ERK2, and RSK2-deficient
and wild-type RSK2 human cells, and human lung cancer H460 cells were
cultured for 12 h in 96-well plates (6,000 per well). The media were then
replaced with corresponding media containing 0.1% FBS and dactylone at
various concentrations in a total volume of 0.1 mL and the cells were
incubated for 22 h. Then, 20 AL of the MTS reagent were added into each
well and MTS reduction was measured 2 h later spectrophotometrically at
492 and 690 nm as background using the Multiskan MS microplate reader
(Labsystems).

Dactylone Anticancer Activity

Figure 1. Dactylone suppresses JB6 cell transformation and human tumor cell phenotype expression. A, the chemical structure of dactylone. The experiments
were carried out as described in Materials and Methods. At nontoxic concentrations, dactylone suppressed malignant transformation of JB6 P+ Cl41 cells (A ) and
phenotype expression of human lung cancer H460 cells (B ), human colon cancer HCT-116 cells (C ), and human melanoma SK-MEL-5 cells (D ) in soft agar. Results are
shown as a percentage of untreated control cells. Columns, mean from six samples of two independent experiments; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05, significant decrease in

phenotype expression assay. For evaluation of the anticancer effects of
dactylone in various human cancer cell lines using a phenotype expression
assay, no additional stimulus was required. EGF (10 ng/mL) was used for
stimulating neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ Cl41 cells. The assay was
carried out in six-well tissue culture plates. Human H460, HCT-116,
SK-MEL-5, or mouse JB6 P+ Cl41 cells (8  103/mL) were treated with
various concentrations of dactylone in 1 mL of 0.33% basal medium Eagle
(BME) agar containing 10% FBS over 3 mL of 0.5% BME agar containing
10% FBS and various concentration of dactylone. The cultures were
maintained in a 37jC, 5% CO2 incubator for 1 week. Cell colonies were then
scored using a LEICA DM IRB inverted research microscope (Leica
Mikroskopie und Systeme GmbH) and Image-Pro Plus software, version
3.0 for Windows (Media Cybernetics). Data for INCC50 (inhibition of the
number of colonies C50) of dactylone were obtained from anchorageindependent transformation or phenotype expression assays, using
regressions that were built by the computer program Statistica 6.0 (StatSoft,
Inc.).
Cell cycle assay. Cell cycle arrest at G1-S phase induced by dactylone
was studied by flow cytometry. JB6 P+ Cl41 and SK-MEL-28 cells were plated
(8  105/10-cm dish) in 5% (JB6 cells) or 10% (SK-MEL-28 cells) FBS/MEM
and allowed to attach overnight. Then, the cells were starved in 0.1% FBS/
MEM for 36 h and followed by incubation for 1 h with various
concentrations of dactylone. Five percent ( JB6 cells) or 10% FBS
(SK-MEL-28 cells) were added to each dish, except control cells, and cells
were incubated for another 16 h. After treatment with dactylone, cells were
washed with PBS and harvested with 0.025% trypsin in 5 mmol/L EDTA in

www.aacrjournals.org

PBS. Trypsinization was stopped by adding 2 mL of 5% FBS in PBS. The
obtained suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 rpm (170 rcf) for 5 min, and
cells were resuspended in 0.4 mL of PBS. Then, 1 mL of ice-cold ethanol was
added and cells were fixed at 20jC for at least 2 h. After washing with
PBS, cells were stained with 20 Ag/mL of propidium iodide and RNase
(200 Ag/mL) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. DNA content was
analyzed by a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer (BD
Biosciences). The population of cells in each cell cycle phase was
determined using ModFIT LT software (Verity Software House, Inc.).
Western blot analysis. The effect of dactylone on the intracellular levels
of phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated kinases and selected proteins in
JB6 Cl41 and human tumor cells was studied using Western blot analysis.
Phosphorylation of ERKs, JNKs, and p38. JB6 Cl41 cells were plated
(1  106/10-cm dish) in 5% FBS/MEM and allowed to attach overnight.
Then, the cells were starved in 0.1% FBS/MEM for 24 h and incubated with
100 Amol/L dactylone for various times or with one concentration of
dactylone for 15 min if phosphorylation of ERKs or p38 kinase was studied
or for 30 min if phosphorylation of JNKs was studied. Then, cells were
washed with PBS and disrupted with 200 AL radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer (1 PBS, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS,
1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L aprotinin, and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The samples were sonicated and centrifuged at 15,000  g
for 15 min. The quantity of protein was measured by the Bradford method
(10) and normalized against controls. The samples were heated to 95jC for
5 min, cooled on ice, and centrifuged at 15,000  g for 5 min. The samples
(30 Ag) were then resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting analysis of

phosphorylated ERK1/2, JNK1/2, or p38 kinases was carried out using
specific antibodies against phosphorylated sites of ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204),
JNK1/2 (Thr183/Tyr185), or p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), respectively.
Determination of intracellular levels of cyclin D3, Cdk4, or
phosphorylated Rb protein. JB6 Cl41 cells were plated (1  106/10-cm
dish) in 5% (JB6 Cl41 cells) or 10% FBS/MEM (SK-MEL-28 cells) or 10% FBS/
RPMI (H460 cells) and allowed to attach overnight. Then, the cells were
starved in 0.1% FBS/MEM (JB6 Cl41 or SK-MEL-28 cells) or 0.1% FBS/RPMI
(H460 cells) for 36 h. Human RSK2-deficient (RSK2 ) or wild-type RSK2
cells were plated (1  106/10-cm dish) in 10% FBS/RPMI and then starved
in 0.1% FBS/RPMI for 36 h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with
various concentrations of dactylone for 1 h, and then 5% FBS (JB6 Cl41
cells) or 10% FBS (other cells) was added to each dish except control cells,
and the cells were incubated for another 24 h. After incubation with
dactylone, cells were washed with PBS and disrupted as described above.
Then, the samples (30 Ag) were resolved by 8% (12% for cyclin D3 protein or
Cdk4) SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting analysis of cyclin D3 protein, Cdk4, or
phosphorylated Rb tumor-suppressor protein was carried out using specific
antibodies against cyclin D3 protein or Cdk4, or against phosphorylated
sites of the Rb protein (Ser780, Ser795, Ser807/811), respectively.
Assessment of the effect of dactylone on p53, activator protein, and
nuclear factor-KB–dependent transcriptional activities. The effect of
dactylone on p53-, AP-1– or nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)–dependent
transcriptional activity in mouse JB6 Cl41 cells was evaluated using the
luciferase method. Viable JB6 Cl41 PG-13 (p53), AP-1, or NF-nB cells
(6  103) suspended in 100 AL 5% FBS/MEM were added into each well of
a 96-well plate. Plates were incubated for 24 h and then treated with
various concentrations of dactylone in 100 AL of 0.1% FBS/MEM. After
incubation with dactylone for 24 h, the cells were disrupted for 1 h at
room temperature with 100 AL/well of lysis buffer [0.1 mol/L potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L DTT, 2 mmol/L
EDTA]. Then, 30 AL of lysate from each well were transferred into a plate
for luminescent analysis and luciferase activity was measured using
100 AL/well of the luciferase assay buffer [1 mmol/L D-luciferin (pH 6.1–6.5),
40 mmol/L Tricin, 2.14 mmol/L magnesium carbonate hydroxide pentahydrate (MgCO3)4  Mg(OH)2  5H2O, 5.34 mmol/L MgSO4  7H2O,
66.6 mmol/L DTT, 1.06 mmol/L ATP, 0.54 mmol/L CoA, and 0.2 mmol/L
EDTA (pH 7.8)] and the Luminoscan Ascent Type 392 microplate reader
(Labsystems).
Apoptosis assessed by flow cytometry. The induction of early and late
apoptosis by dactylone was analyzed by flow cytometry using the Becton
Dickinson FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences). JB6 P+ Cl41 or
SK-MEL-28 cells (3  105 per dish), were grown in 6-cm dishes for 12 h in
5% FBS/MEM (JB6 P+ Cl41) or 10% FBS/MEM (SK-MEL-28 cells). Then, cells
were starved in 0.1% FBS/MEM for 12 h (JB6 P+ Cl41 cells) or 24 h (SK-MEL28 cells). Cells were then treated with dactylone in 0.1% FBS/medium for
72 h (JB6 P+ Cl41 cells) or 24 h (SK-MEL-28 cells). After treatment with
dactylone, the medium was collected and attached cells were harvested
with 0.025% trypsin in 5 mmol/L EDTA in PBS. Trypsinization was stopped
by adding 2 mL of 5% FBS in PBS. Cells were washed by centrifugation at
1,000 rpm (170 rcf) for 5 min and processed for detection of early and late
apoptosis using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide staining according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, cells (1  105–5  105) were
collected after centrifugation, and resuspended in 500 AL of 1 binding
buffer (Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit, Medical & Biological
Laboratories). Then, 5 AL of Annexin V-FITC and 5 AL of propidium iodide
were added, and the cells were incubated in the dark at room temperature
for 5 min and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Results
Cytotoxic and cancer-preventive properties. The MTS
method was applied to examine the potential cytotoxicity of
dactylone. Dactylone was shown to be nontoxic against mouse
epidermal JB6 P+ Cl41 cells and human lung cancer cells H460 at
doses of <150 and 200 Amol/L, respectively. To determine the effect

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

of dactylone on cell transformation or phenotype expression,
which are shown by colony formation of JB6 P+ Cl41 or various
human tumor cells, we used the standard anchorage-independent
malignant transformation or phenotype expression assay (soft
agar; refs. 11–20). To assess whether dactylone could prevent
tumor promoter–induced neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ Cl41
cells, we used EGF (10 ng/mL) as a promoter of colony formation.
The results showed that dactylone exhibited cancer-preventive
properties at noncytotoxic doses. Specifically, a 50% inhibition
of EGF-induced colony formation (INCC50) by dactylone was

cell cycle progression may be mediated, at least in part, by
ERKs.
Drug-induced apoptosis. The cell cycle data suggested that
dactylone might induce programmed cell death or apoptosis.

Figure 3. Dactylone induces apoptosis in JB6 P+ Cl41 (A) or human skin
melanoma SK-MEL-28 cells (B). The induction of apoptosis by dactylone in JB6
P+ Cl41 or human melanoma (SK-MEL-28) cells was analyzed by flow cytometry
using the Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer, as described in
Materials and Methods. Columns, mean from four samples of two independent

achieved at a concentration of 45.4 Amol/L (Fig. 1A). Similar effects
were observed for suppression of phenotype expression of several
human tumor cell lines. For example, the INCC50 for inhibition
values of phenotype expression of lung cancer H460 cells (Fig. 1B),
colon tumor HCT-116 cells (Fig. 1C), and skin melanoma SK-MEL-5
cells (Fig. 1D) were 92.4, 70.5, and 99.2 Amol/L, respectively. This
suggested that dactylone suppressed phenotype expression of
these cancers, and at least one of them, H460, at noncytotoxic
doses.
Cell cycle analysis. Next, we evaluated probable mechanisms
to explain the anticancer action of dactylone, and, in particular,
to evaluate its effect on cell cycle progression. JB6 P+ Cl41
(Fig. 2A), SK-MEL-28 (Fig. 2B), or JB6 DNM-ERK (Fig. 2C) cells
were synchronized at G0 by serum deprivation, restimulated with
FBS, and then treated for 16 h with increasing concentrations
of dactylone. Results of flow cytometry analysis showed that
dactylone induced cell cycle arrest in both JB6 P+ Cl41 and SKMEL-28 cells at the G1-S transition similar to serum deprivation.
Dactylone at 40 Amol/L significantly prevented the JB6 P+ Cl41
cell transition from G1 to the S phase; at 60 Amol/L, it
completely blocked cell cycle progression at the G1-S (Fig. 2A).
In contrast, in DNM-ERK cells (Fig. 2C), dactylone (10–60 Amol/L)
intensified the transition of cells from G1 to S phase. Based on
these data, we suggest that the effect of this compound on the

dactylone on the intracellular levels of phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated
ERKs (A ), p38 (B), or JNKs (C ) in JB6 P+ Cl41 cells was studied using Western
blot analysis as described in Materials and Methods. Dactylone induced
phosphorylation of ERKs, p38 kinase, and JNKs at 50 Amol/L in JB6 P+ Cl41
cells. The optimal time for induction of ERKs and p38 phosphorylation was
15 min, whereas the optimal time of JNKs phosphorylation was f30 min.

Figure 5. Dactylone suppresses cyclin D3 and Cdk4 protein levels and phosphorylation of the Rb protein. The dose-dependent effects of dactylone on the
intracellular levels of cyclin D3, Cdk4, and phosphorylation of Rb in JB6 P+ Cl41 cells (A), melanoma SK-MEL-28 and H460 lung cancer cells (B ), JB6 Cl41
DNM cells (C ), and RSK2-deficient and wild-type RSK2 cells (D) were studied using Western blot analysis, as described in Materials and Methods. Dactylone
treatment decreased expression of cyclin D3 and Cdk4 (A) and inhibited phosphorylation of the Rb protein of JB6 P+ Cl41 cells at Ser780, Ser807/811, and Ser795
(A) in a dose-dependent manner. The same inhibition was observed in human melanoma SK-MEL-28 and lung cancer H460 cells (B ). Interestingly, dactylone
was significantly less effective in suppressing Rb phosphorylation in JB6 Cl41 ERK2 DNM cells compared with p38 DNM or JNK1 DNM JB6 Cl41 cells (C ), indicating
the important role of ERKs in mediating the dactylone effect. This effect was also significantly diminished in RSK2 (Coffin-Lowry Syndrome) patient cells
compared with wild-type RSK2 cells (D ). Representative blot from three independent experiments for each protein.

Induction of apoptosis by dactylone was evaluated by flow
cytometry using Annexin V–FITC and propidium iodide staining.
We found that dactylone induced a dose-dependent apoptosis of
JB6 P+ Cl41 (Fig. 3A) at nontoxic concentrations but also in human
tumor melanoma (SK-MEL-28) cells (Fig. 3B). All these data
supported the idea that the cancer-preventive action of dactylone
may be explained, at least in part, by its ability to inhibit the cell
transition from G1 to S phase and induce apoptosis.
Effect of dactylone on the phosphorylation of key signaling
proteins. Several studies have shown earlier that ERK phosphorylation and activation can induce cell cycle arrest (21–23). In our
study, we showed that dactylone (50 Amol/L) induces phosphorylation of all the major MAP kinases, including ERKs (Fig. 4A), p38
(Fig. 4B), and JNKs (Fig. 4C) in JB6 P+ Cl41 cells. ERKs and p38
phosphorylation was induced rapidly by 100 Amol/L dactylone
(maximal by 15 min), whereas JNK phosphorylation was maximally
induced by f30 min. These data were in agreement with our
preliminary findings, which showed that dactylone may stimulate

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

intracellular processes such as cell cycle arrest mediated, at least in
part, through ERKs.
Based on the results of the cell cycle assay, we also studied the
effect of various doses of dactylone on the expression of cyclin D3,
Cdk4, and the phosphorylation of the Rb tumor suppressor protein,
which regulate progression through the G1-S checkpoint of the cell
cycle (Fig. 5). Results indicated that dactylone treatment decreased
expression of cyclin D3 and Cdk4 in JB6 P+ Cl41 cells (Fig. 5A).
Dactylone also suppressed phosphorylation of the Rb protein of JB6
P+ Cl41 cells at Ser780, Ser807/811, and Ser795 (Fig. 5A) in a dosedependent manner. Similar inhibitory effects by dactylone were
also observed in the human tumor SK-MEL-28 and H460 cell lines
(Fig. 5B).
Additional evidence supporting an active role of the ERK
signaling pathway in mediating the dactylone-induced inhibition of
Rb phosphorylation with subsequent cell cycle arrest at the G1-S
transition was obtained comparing the effects of dactylone on JB6
P+ Cl41 wild-type, DNM-ERK2, DMN-p38, and DNM-JNK1 cells

Dactylone Anticancer Activity

(Fig. 5C). Interestingly, at concentrations up to 100 Amol/L,
dactylone had no effect on phosphorylation of Rb in DNM-ERK2
cells. In contrast, Rb phosphorylation was suppressed by dactylone
in DNM-p38 and DNM-JNK1 cells. The inhibitory effect of
dactylone was also significantly diminished in RSK2 (Coffin
Lowry Syndrome patient) cells compared with wild-type RSK2 cells
(Fig. 5D). RSK2 is a key downstream target of the ERK signaling
pathway (24).
Influence of dactylone on p53-dependent transcriptional
activity. The effect of dactylone on p53-dependent transcriptional
activity was assessed with JB6 P+ Cl41 cell lines stably expressing a
luciferase reporter gene controlled by a p53 DNA-binding sequence.
We found that dactylone at a nontoxic concentration (100 Amol/L)
inhibited p53-dependent transcriptional activity in JB6 P+ Cl41 cells
by f2-fold (Fig. 6A). The significance of the decreased p53 nuclear
factor–dependent transcriptional activation induced by dactylone
was verified using nonparametric statistical method MannWhitney U test (computer program Statistica 6.0, StatSoft). The
tumor-suppressor p53 protein plays a critical role in apoptosis and
an increase of p53 protein production followed by apoptosis is a
common characteristic effect of cancer-preventive agents such as
resveratrol (25), black tea extract (26), and many others. However,

in our case, we did not observe an increase in p53 protein levels,
although apoptosis was induced by dactylone.

Discussion
Our data showed that dactylone is representative of a new group
of natural cancer-preventive agents. To the best our knowledge,
this is the first marine terpenoid metabolite used at noncytotoxic
doses that inhibited cell transformation of normal mouse cells as
well as suppressed the phenotype expression of various human
cancer cell lines. Further details regarding a probable molecular
mechanism of action were also elucidated. Results reported here
showed that dactylone induced G1-S cell progression arrest and
apoptosis of tumor cells; decreased Rb protein phosphorylation at
Ser795, Ser780, and Ser807/811 sites; and inhibited expression of cyclin
D3, Cdk4. Active, hypophosphorylated Rb is a potent negative
regulator of cell cycle progression from G1 into and through S
phase (27–30). A possible mechanism of dactylone antitumor
action is shown in Fig. 6. Several other previously reported cancerpreventive agents seem to act in a manner similar to dactylone. For
example, like dactylone, inositol hexaphosphate, a dietary constituent found in rice, was reported to decrease cyclin-dependent
kinase (Cdk) 4 and cyclin D1 protein levels and also showed an
inhibitory effect on Rb phosphorylation at Ser780, Ser807, and Ser811,
causing G1 arrest and apoptotic death of human prostate
carcinoma LNCaP cells (31). However, in contrast to many
proapoptotic drugs, dactylone did not increase p53 transcriptional
activity. Similar cases have been previously reported in the
scientific literature. For example, in PC-3 cells, indole-3-carbinol
from fruit and vegetable diets inhibited Rb phosphorylation and
induced G1 cell arrest leading to apoptosis independently of the
p53 responsible element (32). Flavone, a parent compound of
dietary flavonoids, inhibited proliferation, migration, and capillary
tube formation of human endothelial cells through the downregulation of the hyperphosphorylated form of the Rb protein
without an effect on the expression of p53 (33). However, the
significance of the dactylone-associated decrease in p53 transcriptional activity as it related to the observed cancer-preventive
effects of dactylone remains unclear. Similar to many other
anticancer agents, the action of dactylone may be mediated at
least partially through the MAP kinase signaling pathways.
Actually, dactylone activates phosphorylation of all the primary
MAP kinases. However, some of our results, including the absence
of G1-S transition arrest and the lack of inhibition of Rb protein
phosphorylation in JB6 Cl41 ERK2 DNM cells, support the idea that
ERKs play one of the main roles in the cellular response to
dactylone application. Although this role also requires further
investigation, other reports indicated that ERK1/2 and p38 may
cooperate to induce G1 cell cycle arrest (34).
All these results, as well as results from others, showed that
marine chamigrane sesquiterpenoids (exemplified by dactylone),
constituents of some exotic kinds of seafood, represent a
prospective group of natural products as cancer-preventive and
antitumor agents. Indeed, some marine brominated chamigrane
sesquiterpenoids isolated from Laurencia spp. were reported
(35, 36) to produce a novel profile of differential cytotoxicity in the
National Cancer Institute in vitro screening system and were more
cytotoxic to certain cell lines in the colon cancer subpanel at
concentrations 10- to 100-fold lower than the average cytotoxic
concentration observed in other tumor subpanels. Quite possibly,
similar effects such as prevention of cell transformation,

suppression of tumor cell proliferation, or cell cycle arrest
followed by apoptosis might be observed with the dietary use of
some red algae. These actions may be accompanied by some other
useful effects of the halogenated sesquiterpenoids such as a
potent antibacterial activity against antibiotic-resistant bacteria
and inhibition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (37–41), antiviral
activity against herpes simplex virus-1 (42), and anthelmintic
properties (43) previously indicated for these types of natural
products. These effects may explain, in part, some of the useful
properties attributed to seafood gleaned from public opinion.
Taking into account that the majority of neoplasms seem to have
aberrations in the retinoblastoma pathways due to hyperactivation
of Cdks (44), the observation that dactylone might be a new
structural type of intracellular inhibitor of cyclin D3, Cdk4, and

inhibitors among natural products of this chemical series and
their synthetic analogues may lead to the creation of new highly
