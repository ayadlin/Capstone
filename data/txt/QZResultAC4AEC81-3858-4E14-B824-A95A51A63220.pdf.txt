ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Single-agent EGFR inhibitor therapy is effective mainly in patients
with lung cancer and EGFR mutations. Treating patients who develop resistance,
or who are insensitive from the outset, often because of resistant mutations, other
aberrations or the lack of an EGFR mutation, probably requires rational combinations.
We therefore investigated the outcome of EGFR inhibitor-based combination regimens
in patients with heavily-pretreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) referred to a
Phase I Clinic.
Methods: We reviewed the electronic records of patients with NSCLC treated
with an EGFR inhibitor-based combination regimen: erlotinib and cetuximab; erlotinib,
cetuximab and bevacizumab; erlotinib and dasatinib; erlotinib and bortezomib; or
cetuximab and sirolimus.
Results: EGFR mutations were detected in 16% of patients (21/131). EGFR
inhibitor-based combination regimens were administered to 15 patients with EGFRmutant NSCLC and 24 with EGFR wild-type disease. Stable disease (SD) ≥6 months/
partial remission (PR) was attained in 20% of EGFR-mutant patients (3/15; two
with sensitive mutations and secondary resistance to prior erlotinib, and one with
a resistant mutation), as well as 26% of evaluable patients (5/19) with wild-type
disease. One of three evaluable patients with squamous cell histology achieved SD
for 26.5 months (EGFR wild-type, TP53-mutant, regimen=erlotinib, cetuximab and
bevacizumab).
Conclusions: Eight of 34 evaluable patients (24%) with advanced, refractory
NSCLC evaluable for response achieved SD ≥6 months/PR (PR=3; SD ≥6 months=5)
on EGFR inhibitor-based combination regimens (erlotinib, cetuximab; erlotinib,
cetuximab and bevacizumab; and, erlotinib, bortezomib), including patients with
secondary resistance to single-agent EGFR inhibitors, resistant mutations, wild-type
disease, and, squamous histology.

INTRODUCTION

included an EGFR inhibitor combination (Patients and
Methods and Table 2).
Of the remaining six EGFR-mutant NSCLC
patients, one patient was treated on a clinical trial that did
not include an EGFR inhibitor, one patient was referred to
hospice, one patient died soon after being seen, and three
patients were treated with single-agent erlotinib by their
primary oncologist or on study.

Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) signaling pathway is known to play a significant
role in the pathophysiology of non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC)[1]. It may also be important in other tumors[2].
Aberrant activation of the signaling pathway may occur
due to mutations in exons 18 through 21, which encode
part of the tyrosine kinase domain and are bundled around
the ATP-binding pocket of the enzyme[1-4]. There is
a broad literature on the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors
in NSCLC[3-6] . Although many patients with EGFRmutant NSCLC respond to EGFR inhibitors initially, they
eventually develop resistance to treatment. Therefore,
combination approaches to overcome resistance is an area
of active clinical research[7, 8].
The role of EGFR inhibition in patients with wildtype EGFR and lung cancer has been debated. Studies
with erlotinib show increased survival in unselected
patients with lung cancer,[9] though there is a general
consensus that patients with sensitive EGFR mutations
are most likely to benefit[3, 4]. Recently, preclinical
studies have demonstrated that EGFR can signal via
a kinase-independent pathway[10], suggesting a role
for combining EGFR kinase inhibitors and antibodies.
Furthermore, preclinical models suggest that several
molecules synergize with EGFR inhibitors, including the
multikinase inhibitor dasatinib[11] and the proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib[12]. Herein, we report our experience
with EGFR-based combination regimens in patients with
advanced, heavily-pretreated NSCLC referred to a phase
I clinic, including those with secondary resistance to
erlotinib, resistant mutations, and EGFR wild-type disease.

Patients treated with EGFR inhibitor-based
combinations
Patient characteristics of the 15 EGFR mutationpositive and 24 EGFR wild-type NSCLC patients treated
with EGFR inhibitor-based combination regimens are
summarized in Table 1.

Co-existing mutations in 15 EGFR-mutant
patients treated with EGFR-based regimens

RESULTS

Simultaneous mutations in other genes were
assessed when tissue was available. Two of seven EGFR
mutation-positive patients (29%) assessed had a PIK3CA
mutation. One patient (case #15, Table 2) had an E545K
mutation in exon 9 of the PIK3CA gene in addition to the
EGFR mutation (T847I in exon 21; unknown sensitivity
to EGFR inhibitors). A second patient (case #5, Table 2)
had an E542K mutation in exon 9 of the PIK3CA gene
in addition to two known sensitive EGFR mutations
(L858R and G873E) in exon 21. No patient that underwent
treatment with an EGFR inhibitor-based combination had
a KRAS mutation (though one patient who was not treated
had a G12C mutation in addition to a resistant EGFR
[D761N] mutation in exon 19).

EGFR mutations

Other mutations in EGFR wild-type patients
treated with EGFR-based regimens

Twenty-one of 131 NSCLC patients (16%) tested
had EGFR mutations. Twenty-five EGFR mutations were
present in those 21 individuals. Four patients had two
EGFR mutations. Ten of the 25 EGFR mutations were
present in exon 19; three in exon 20; and, 12 in exon 21.
Of the four patients who had two EGFR mutations, three
of them had two EGFR mutations in exon 21 and 1 patient
had an EGFR mutation in exon 19 and exon 20. Deletions
in exon 19 (n = 9) and the L858R substitution mutation
in exon 21 (n = 7) were the two most common types of
mutations.

Two of 13 patients (15%) with EGFR wild-type
disease assessed for PIK3CA mutation had an E545K
mutation in exon 9 of the PIK3CA gene (cases #15 and 23,
Table 3). Two of 20 patients (10%) with EGFR wild-type
evaluated for KRAS mutation had a G12D mutation (cases
#20 and 21, Table 3). Of the two patients with EGFR
wild-type disease evaluated for TP53 mutation, one had
an R196 mutation in exon 6 (case #1, Table 3) and the
other had a V157F mutation in exon 5 (case #19, Table 3).

Responses to EGFR inhibitor-based combinations

Treatment

Three of 15 evaluable (20%) patients attained
either PR (n=2; cases #2 and 5, Table 2) or SD ≥6

Fifteen of the 21 patients (71%) with an underlying
EGFR mutation were enrolled in five clinical trials that

months (n=1; case #10, Table 2). Six patients came off
study prior to post-treatment imaging evaluation due to
clinical progression (all of whom were arbitrarily graphed
as 20% progression in Figure 1). One patient (case #2,
Table 2) achieved a PR (33% decrease; duration=13+
months) on erlotinib/cetuximab despite having a known
EGFR-resistant mutation (insertion in exon 20)[13]. This
patient had previously received two lines of standard
chemotherapy but had not received prior EGFR inhibitor
therapy. TTF on the last standard treatment before referral
to phase I was 2.0 months. A second patient (case #5,
Table 2) with two known EGFR-sensitive mutations
(L858R and G873E in exon 21) and a PIK3CA mutation
(E542K in exon 9) had a PR (55% decrease; duration=9+
months) on erlotinib/cetuximab/bevacizumab. This patient
had received six lines of prior therapy including singleagent erlotinib (TTF=14.3 months). TTF on the last
standard treatment before referral was 4.5 months. A third
patient (case #10, Table 2) with a known EGFR-sensitive
mutation (L858R) in exon 21 attained SD for 10+ months
on erlotinib/bortezomib. This patient had received six lines
of prior therapy including single-agent erlotinib (TTF =
5.5 months). TTF on the last standard treatment before
referral was 5.9 months.

based combination regimen after referral, two patients
(17%) achieved either PR (n=1; case #5, Table 2;
duration=9+ months) or SD≥6 months (n=1; case #10,
Table 2; duration=10+ months) on this study. Of the three
patients who achieved SD ≥6 months/PR on this study,
two patients (67%; cases #10 and #5) had received prior
erlotinib therapy as single-agent and had progressed. The
TTF on the EGFR inhibitor-based combination therapies
on this study is ongoing at 10+ and 9+ months vs. 5.5 and
14.3 months respectively on prior single-agent erlotinib.
For the 12 EGFR-mutant patients who received prior
EGFR inhibitors, median TTF on their EGFR inhibitorbased combination regimen after referral was 2 months
as compared to 8 months on a prior EGFR inhibitor
(p=0.044)

Responses to EGFR inhibitor-based combinations
in NSCLC patients with EGFR wild-type disease
Of the 24 patients with EGFR wild-type disease
(Table 3) treated on the same protocols as listed above,
19 were evaluable for response to treatment. Five patients
were not evaluable for response, as restaging had not
yet occurred at the time of this analysis. Overall, 5 of
19 evaluable patients (26%) had either a PR (n=1, case
#12, Table 3; duration = 4.1 months) or SD ≥6 months
(n=4; cases #1, 6, 9, and, 10; duration = 26.5 9.2, 6.5,
and 11.0 months respectively). All of them were treated
on erlotinib/cetuximab/bevacizumab. The median TTF

on EGFR inhibitor-based combinations in phase I clinical
trial program is statistically longer (3.3 months; 95% CI,
1.2-5.4 months) compared to median TTF on last standard
therapy (2.3 months; 95% CI, 1.8-2.8 months; p=0.045;
Figure 3). Four of five patients with SD ≥6 months/PR had
not received prior EGFR inhibitors. One patient (case #6,
Table 3), who had previously received erlotinib as a singleagent for 6.2 months and had progressed, had SD for 9.2
months on erlotinib/cetuximab/bevacizumab. One of five
patients who achieved SD ≥6 months/PR had squamous

therapy, but not an EGFR inhibitor. TTF on last therapy
before referral was 1.0 month.

Responses in NSCLC patients with other
simultaneous mutations
PIK3CA:
Of the two EGFR mutation-positive patients with
a simultaneous PIK3CA mutation, one patient (case
#5, Table 2) with an E542K mutation in exon 9 of the
PIK3CA gene in addition to two sensitive EGFR mutations
(L858R and G873E in exon 21), achieved a PR (-55%)
for 9+ months on erlotinib/cetuximab/bevacizumab. The
other EGFR mutation-positive patient (T847I in exon
21; unknown sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors) with a coexisting E545K mutation in exon 9 of the PIK3CA gene
(case #15, Table 2), had progressive disease in 0.4 months
on erlotinib and dasatinib.
Of the two EGFR wild-type NSCLC patients with
a E545K mutation in exon 9 of the PIK3CA gene, one
patient (case #15, Table 3) has ongoing SD at 3+ months
on erlotinib/cetuximab/bevacizumab; the other patient
(case #23, Table 3) had SD for 3 months on erlotinib/
dasatinib.

Responses in NSCLC patients with squamous cell
histology
A total of three evaluable patients treated on EGFR
inhibitor-based combinations had squamous cell histology,
two of whom had EGFR wild-type disease (cases #1 and
14, Table 3), and one of whom had an EGFR mutation
(case #15, Table 2). One of the two patients with wildtype EGFR (case #1, Table 3) attained SD for 26.5
months on erlotinib/cetuximab/bevacizumab. This patient
had received two lines of standard therapy, but was not
previously treated with an EGFR inhibitor. TTF on the
last standard therapy prior to this study was 2.4 months.
A second patient with wild-type EGFR (case #14, Table
3) had progressive disease after 2.1 months on erlotinib/
cetuximab/bevacizumab. This patient had received only
one line of standard therapy (not an EGFR inhibitor) and
the TTF was 4.2 months. The third patient was EGFR
mutation-positive (case #15, Table 2; T847I, unknown
sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors) and also had an additional
PIK3CA mutation (E545K in exon 9); this patient had
progressive disease within one month on erlotinib and

KRAS/TP53:
The two EGFR wild-type patients with a KRAS
mutation (cases #20 and 21, Table 3) were not evaluable
as they had not reached the post-treatment assessment.
None of the 19 evaluable patients with EGFR wild-type
had a KRAS mutation. Of the two EGFR wild-type patients
with a TP53 mutation, one patient (case #1, Table 3) had
prolonged SD for 26.5 months on erlotinib/cetuximab/
bevacizumab; the other patient (case #19, Table 3) had PD
after 0.5 months on erlotinib/cetuximab.

DISCUSSION

Overall Survival

The identification of molecular aberrations and
selection of therapy to ‘match’ these aberrations is gaining
momentum as a preferred treatment approach[14-24]. In
the Phase I setting, studies have sought to validate this
approach across a range of mutation types, and to support
broad genomic testing.
EGFR mutations, frequently observed in patients
with NSCLC, activate the kinase activity of EGFR, leading
to upregulation of downstream survival pathways[25, 26].
In our study, EGFR mutations in exons 18-21 were present
in 21 of 131 patients (16%) with NSCLC. Despite the
dramatic initial responses to single-agent EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in EGFR mutation-positive
NSCLC patients, 70% of them relapse within one year of
initiation of therapy[7, 8, 27]. It has been reported that
kinase-independent activity of EGFR prevents autophagic
cell death, perhaps accounting for progression of disease
despite treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors [10]. It is
conceivable that combining EGFR kinase inhibitors with
EGFR antibody may therefore overcome resistance. Based
on preclinical studies, other strategies to augment EGFR
inhibition includes use of bortezomib in combination with
EGFR kinase inhibitors due to its growth inhibitory and
pro-apoptic effects on cancer cell lines[12] and dasatinib
in combination with EGFR kinase inhibitor as in vitro data
from NSCLC cell lines demonstrates that Src inhibition
may enhance the antitumor activity of EGFR inhibition in
the presence of EGFR mutations[11].
In our study, eight of 34 evaluable patients (23%)
treated with EGFR inhibitor-based combinations
achieved SD ≥6 months/PR. Those individuals include
EGFR mutation-positive patients with a de novo resistant
mutation (n=1); EGFR mutation-positive (sensitive
mutation) and prior secondary resistance to EGFR
inhibitors (n=2); and, EGFR wild-type disease (n=5;
including a patient with squamous cell histology).

The median OS of 15 EGFR mutation-positive
patients treated on EGFR inhibitor-based regimens from
the date of start of therapy was 4.7 months (95% CI, 3.5
– 5.9 months).The one year survival rate was 31% (95%
CI, 22.3-41.1%). At the time of analysis, 12 of 15 patients
were dead. The median OS of 24 EGFR wild-type patients
treated on the same regimens was 3.8 months (95% CI,
0.6-7.0 months).

combinations can be active in patients with wild-type
disease[39, 40]. All these patients received erlotinib/
cetuximab/bevacizumab. Previously, modest antitumor
activity has been reported in 4 of 13 NSCLC patients with
wild-type EGFR (31%) on gefitinib and cetuximab[41].
We also noted anecdotal activity in patients with
squamous cell histology. Of the three evaluable patients
with squamous cell histology who were treated with EGFR
inhibitor-based regimens, two patients had EGFR wildtype disease (cases #1 and 14, Table 3) and one patient
was EGFR-mutant (case #15, Table 2). One patient (TP53mutation positive; case #1, Table 3) with EGFR wild-type,
squamous cell histology achieved SD for 26.5 months on
erlotinib/cetuximab/bevacizumab after progression on
two prior therapies. Limited data exists regarding patients
with squamous cell histology treated with EGFR inhibitors
because these patients typically have EGFR wild-type
disease[42]. In one study [43], 121 patients with squamous
cell carcinoma of the lung were treated with single-agent
erlotinib. Thirty seven of 69 evaluable patients achieved
PR/SD; however, the duration of response or molecular
aberrations was unknown. In another study[44], 1,125
NSCLC patients including 190 patients with squamous
cell carcinoma were randomized to either chemotherapy
alone or to cetuximab plus chemotherapy. A survival
advantage was observed in 557 NSCLC patients treated
with cetuximab plus chemotherapy; however, information
on which of these responders had squamous cell histology
was not reported. Finally, one responsive patient was
noted to have a TP53 mutation. Recent retrospective data
analysis posits longer progression-free survival for TP53mutant patients on bevacizumab-based regimens[45].
The activity noted in these subtypes of NSCLC
is hypothesis-generating; however, sample size is a
significant limitation of this study. The heterogeneity
of combination treatments and the retrospective nature
of the analysis must also be considered. Therefore, any
interpretation of these results needs to be approached
with caution. Furthermore, the antitumor activity seen
in two patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC (cases #5
and 10, Table 2), who had progressed on prior treatment
with erlotinib after initial response, may be due to the retreatment effect that occurs in patients with EGFR mutant
disease with reintroduction of an EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor after a drug holiday[38]. However, in the latter
case (case #10, Table 2), the TTF is ongoing and at least
double the TTF on prior EGFR inhibitor therapy.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that treatment
with EGFR inhibitor-based combination therapies was
associated with SD ≥6 months/PR in subtypes of heavily
pretreated advanced NSCLC not traditionally associated
with response to EGFR inhibitors, including 1 of 2 patients
with a de novo EGFR-resistant mutation; 2 of 12 patients
(17%) with an EGFR-sensitive mutation and secondary
EGFR resistance after a period of initial response; 5 of 19
evaluable patients (26%) with EGFR wild-type disease;

Of the 15 EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC patients
treated on EGFR inhibitors, three (20%) had SD ≥6
months/PR (cases #2, 5 and 10, Table 2). One patient
with a known EGFR-resistant mutation (insertion in exon
20; case #2, Table 2) has an ongoing PR (33% decrease)
at 13+ months on therapy with erlotinib and the EGFR
antibody cetuximab. Indeed, there is preclinical data
demonstrating superiority when EGFR kinase inhibitors
are combined with EGFR antibody in regard to antitumor
effect[28, 29]
A second patient (case #5, Table 2) with two known
EGFR-sensitive mutations (L858R and G873E in exon 21)
attained a PR (55% decrease) for 9+ months on erlotinib/
cetuximab/bevacizumab. Interestingly, this patient
also had a PIK3CA mutation (E542K in exon 9) in the
downstream signaling pathway which is a known resistant
mechanism to EGFR inhibition[30]. The PIK3CA mutation
may explain why the patient had previously developed
secondary resistance to single-agent erlotinib. Preclinical
studies have demonstrated antitumor activity with PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor combinations in gefitinib-resistant
PIK3CA-mutant NSCLC cell lines[31]. Clinical trials
with dual blockade of PI3K and mTOR are underway[32,
33]. The response seen in this patient on erlotinib/
cetuximab/bevacizumab may be due to synergistic effect
of simultaneous EGFR and vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) inhibition, as demonstrated in preclinical
models, including EGFR inhibitor-resistant cell lines[34]
and in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer[35],
and NSCLC[36, 37]. A third patient (case #10, Table 2)
with a known EGFR-sensitive mutation (L858R), with
previous response to single agent erlotinib and subsequent
resistance, has ongoing SD (26% decrease) for 10+
months on erlotinib and bortezomib. There is preclinical
evidence that dual blockade of proteasome activity and
EGFR function by combining bortezomib plus cetuximab
has synergistic antitumor activity[12]. Patients treated
with erlotinib may also benefit from re-treatment[38],
so this could also explain the observation of prolonged
stable disease, at least in part. However, the TTF on prior
erlotinib was 5.5 months, while the current TTF is 10+
months, suggesting that the longer current TTF could
not be due to erlotinib alone. These observations indicate
that combining treatment with drugs that target different
signaling pathways may help patients who had progressed
on single-agent targeted therapy after a period of initial
response.
Unexpectedly, patients with EGFR wild-type
disease were also noted to have salutary effects on
EGFR inhibitor-based combination therapies. Five of 19
evaluable NSCLC patients with wild-type EGFR treated
on the same EGFR inhibitor-based regimens attained SD
≥6 months/PR. The median TTF on EGFR inhibitor-based
regimen (3.3 months) was significantly longer than the
median TTF on their last standard therapy (2.3 months;
p=0.045; Figure 3). These data suggest that EGFR-based

may be warranted.

suggesting complementary pathway inhibition. The
trials
included
erlotinib/cetuximab/bevacizumab
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00543504); erlotinib/
cetuximab (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00895362);
erlotinib/bortezomib
(ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier:
NCT00895687); erlotinib/dasatinib (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT00895128); and cetuximab/sirolimus
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00940381). Treatment
was chosen based on trial availability and physician and
patient preference. Treatment continued until disease
progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Treatment
was carried out according to the specific requirements of
the treatment protocols selected. Assessments, including
history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluations,
were done as specified in each protocol, typically before
the initiation of therapy, weekly during the first cycle,
and then, at a minimum, at the beginning of each new
treatment cycle.

METHODS
Patients
We investigated the EGFR mutation status of
131 consecutive patients with NSCLC referred to the
Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics (Phase
I Clinical Trials Program) at The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) beginning January
1, 2009. The study and all treatments were conducted
in accordance with the guidelines of the MD Anderson
Institutional Review Board.

Response assessment

Tissue samples and mutation analyses

Efficacy was assessed from computed tomography
(CT) scans and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/
or positron emission tomography (PET) scan at baseline
before treatment initiation and then every 2-3 cycles (6–12
weeks), depending on the protocol. All radiographs were
read in the Department of Radiology at MDACC and
reviewed in the Department of Investigational Cancer
Therapeutics tumor measurement clinic. Responses were
categorized per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 [46] criteria and were reported as
best response. Complete response (CR) was defined as
the disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable
disease; partial response (PR) was defined as at least
a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of
measurable target lesions; progressive disease (PD) was
defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest
diameter of measurable target lesions, or unequivocal
progression of a non-target lesion, or the appearance
of a new lesion; and stable disease (SD) was defined as
neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient
increase to qualify for PD. A waterfall plot was used to
illustrate the anti-tumor activity observed in patients
evaluable for response.

EGFR mutations were investigated in archival
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks or
material from fine needle aspiration biopsy obtained from
diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures. All histologies
were centrally reviewed at MDACC. EGFR mutation
testing was done in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendment–certified Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory
within the Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine
at MDACC.
DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue by using a QIAmp DNA Minikit (Qiagen
Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. EGFR exons 18-21 sequence were analyzed
in both sense and antisense directions for the presence of
mutations using nested PCR followed by direct sequencing
of the nested PCR amplicons. The nested-PCR was done
using the primers and annealing conditions as described
by Lynch et al[3]. The nested PCR amplicons were
purified using the Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification
Kit, followed by cycle-sequencing using BigDye
Terminator Kit v1.1 (ABI, Foster City, CA) on ABI Prism
3130 Genetic Analyzer, according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Whenever possible, in addition to EGFR, we
tested for other mutations such as PIK3CA (codons 532 to
554 in exon 9 and codons 1011 to 1062 in exon 20), KRAS
(codons 12, 13, and 61) and TP53 (exons 4 to 9).

Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics, including demographics,
EGFR mutation status and prior treatment with an
EGFR inhibitor were summarized using frequencies and
percentages. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was defined
as the time interval between the start of therapy and the
date of disease progression or death, whichever occurred
first. Patients who were alive and had not failed treatment
were censored at the time of their last follow-up. The

Treatment and evaluation
EGFR inhibitors included the small molecule
inhibitor erlotinib and the antibody cetuximab. Rationale
for the trials was based on preclinical work demonstrating
synergistic or additive effects and/or clinical work

Kaplan-Meier method [47] was used to estimate TTF and
log-rank tests [48] were performed to compare subgroups
of patients. All tests were two-sided, and P <0.05 was
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses
were carried out using SPSS (version 19.0; SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA).
