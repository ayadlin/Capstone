Abstract
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), potent cytotoxic drugs
covalently linked to antibodies via chemical linkers, provide
a means to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy by
targeting the drug to neoplastic cells while reducing side
effects. Here, we systematically examine the potential targets
and linker-drug combinations that could provide an optimal
ADC for the treatment for non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma. We
identified seven antigens (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD72,
CD79b, and CD180) for potential treatment of non–Hodgkin’s
lymphoma with ADCs. ADCs with cleavable linkers mediated
in vivo efficacy via all these targets; ADCs with uncleavable
linkers were only effective when targeted to CD22 and CD79b.
In target-independent safety studies in rats, the uncleavable
linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity, presumably due to the
reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into
the circulation. Thus, our data suggest that ADCs with
cleavable linkers work on a broad range of targets, and for
specific targets, ADCs with uncleavable linkers provide a
promising opportunity to improve the therapeutic window for
ADCs in humans. [Cancer Res 2009;69(6):2358–64]

Introduction
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), cytotoxic drugs linked to
antibodies through specialized chemical linkers, provide a method
to target cytotoxic drugs to a tumor and minimize normal tissue
damage, thereby increasing the effectiveness and reducing the
toxicity of chemotherapy. The design of an ideal ADC is a
dichotomy requiring tight linkage between the cytotoxic drug and
the antibody to prevent nonspecific drug release while the agent is
in circulation, yet appropriate release of the drug when the ADC
reaches the tumor. The specific release of the cytotoxic drug is
critical to the safety of the ADCs because the cytotoxic drug
must be hundreds-fold more potent than the drugs used in typical
systemic chemotherapy to be effective in the context of an ADC
(1–3). To accomplish this specificity, specialized linkers between
the antibody and drug have been designed that are cleaved only in

a specific microenvironment found in or on the target tumor cell.
Examples include linkers that are cleaved by acidic conditions,
reducing conditions, or proteases (4–6). Another option is to have
stable linkers that are not cleaved, but rather, coupled to antibodies
against tumor antigens that are internalized and then degraded,
releasing the drug attached to the conjugating amino acid within
cells (7, 8). Thus, the active metabolite(s) and amounts of active
drug released should be substantially different for the cleavable
linker ADC and this could affect the safety and efficacy of the
ADCs.
Another factor that has been less explored is the interaction of
the linker type and the target. In vitro data suggest that the biology
of the target, in particular, the extent of trafficking to the lysosomal
compartment, will influence the effectiveness of the ADC (7–10).
In vivo, the situation is even more complex; the extracellular
microenvironment, and the intracellular trafficking of the target,
the longer exposure times (weeks instead of days), in combination
with the linker-drug used, will determine where, to what extent,
and in what form the cytotoxic drug is released and thus which
linker-drug combinations are both effective and safe.
This work focuses on four linker-drug combinations that all
result in the release of cytotoxic metabolites that inhibit
microtubule polymerization. We used two maytansinoid linkerdrugs consisting of N(2¶)-deacetyl-N(2¶)-(3-mercapto-1-oxopropyl)maytansine (DM1) with one of two different linkers that are
conjugated to the antibody through lysines; the disulfide linker
N -succinimydyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)-pentanoate (SPP), which
releases drug through the reduction of a disulfide bond (11); or
the thioether linker succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (MCC), which is uncleavable such that the
antibody must be degraded to release the active drug lysine-MCCDM1 (8). The other two ADCs are based on auristatins, which are
mitotic inhibitors derived from dolastatin 10: monomethylauristatin E, linked to antibody cysteines by maleimidocaproyl-valinecitrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (MC-vc-PAB-MMAE); and
monomethylauristatin F, linked to antibody cysteines by maleimidocaproyl (MC-MMAF). MC-vc-PAB-MMAE ADCs release free,
membrane-permeable MMAE when cleaved by proteases such as
cathepsin B (12). In contrast, MC-MMAF ADCs are uncleavable, like
MCC-DM1, and must be internalized and degraded within a cell,
releasing cysteine-MC-MMAF as the active drug (7).
The development of ADCs for the treatment of non–Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (NHL) provides a unique opportunity to develop ADC
treatments for an important unmet medical need and as a model
system to understand ADCs. NHL is responsive to chemotherapy,
unconjugated antibody therapies, and radioconjugate therapies,

Antibody-Drug Conjugates Targeted to NHL

suggesting that these tumors are accessible by antibody-based
therapies and would be responsive to cytotoxics delivered by an
ADC. Furthermore, clinical experience with rituximab (chimeric
IgG1 anti-CD20), which greatly reduces the number of normal as
well as malignant B cells without serious side effects, suggests that
expression of an ADC target on normal B-cells and the consequent
elimination of normal B cells is not a major safety concern (13).
There are a number of potential ADC targets whose expression is
limited to the B-cell compartment and that are expressed on NHLs.
This abundance of targets with appropriate expression patterns
allow for a unique opportunity to study the effect of the target on
ADCs. We identified seven potential antigens with the appropriate
B cell–specific expression patterns and tested the efficacy and
safety of four different linker-drug formats. This combinatorial
approach allowed us to elucidate some general principles for the
development of ADCs, as well as identifying two targets that are
responsive to ADCs with a wide range of linker-drugs and therefore
hold the most promise for the treatment of NHL with ADCs.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and ADCs. Anti-CD19 (B496, mIgG1; Biomeda), anti-CD22
(RFB4; Leinco), and anti-CD180 (MHR73-11, mIgG1; from eBioscience) were
purchased and further purified on protein A-Sepharose and MonoQ resins
to reduce endotoxin levels. The anti-CD21 (THB-5, mIgG2a) hybridoma was
obtained from American Type Culture Collection and anti-CD79b (SN8,
mIgG1) hybridoma was obtained from Ben Seon (Roswell Park Cancer
Institute), and the antibodies from these were produced and purified as
described below. Anti-CD22 (10F4v3, huIgG1), anti-CD72 (10D6.8.1, mIgG1),
anti-gp120 (mIgG1), and trastuzumab (huIgG1) were generated at Genentech, Inc., using previously described methods (14–16). Hybridoma supernatants were harvested and purified by affinity chromatography ( fast
protein liquid chromatography; Pharmacia) as previously described (17).
Purified antibodies were sterile-filtered (0.2 Am pore size; Nalgene) and
stored at 4jC in PBS. MCC-DM1, MC-MMAF, and MC-vc-PAB-MMAE ADCs
were made as previously described (12, 18). The SPP conjugates were
prepared the same as the previously described for the MCC conjugates
except that the purified antibody was buffer-exchanged into a solution
containing 50 mmol/L of potassium phosphate and 2 mmol/L of EDTA
(pH 6.0). SPP was dissolved in 100% ethanol and added to the antibody
solution to make a final SPP/antibody molar ratio of 8:1, resulting in final
DM1:antibody ratios of 3:1 to 4:1.
Xenograft models. All animal studies were performed in compliance
with NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
Genentech. Cells for implantation were washed and suspended in HBSS
(Hyclone) and inoculated subcutaneously into the flanks of female CB17
ICR severe combined immunodeficiency mice (7–16 weeks of age from
Charles Rivers Laboratories), in a volume of 0.2 mL/mouse. When mean
tumor size reached the desired volume, the mice were divided into groups
of 8 to 10 mice with the same mean tumor size and dosed intravenously via
the tail vein with ADCs or antibodies. ADC doses were either measured as
the mass of the conjugated cytotoxic small molecule drug per surface area
of the mouse (e.g., 300 Ag antibody-linked DM1/m2 of mouse), or as a
constant mass of ADC per mass of the mouse (e.g., 5 mg of ADC/kg mouse).
In general, the drug loads on the antibodies in any given experiment were
similar (three to four drug molecules per antibody), so these two measures
could be considered equivalent.
Antibody internalization studies. B-cell lines were incubated for 3 or
20 h at 37jC with 1 Ag/mL test antibody, along with FcR block (Miltenyi),
and 25 Ag/mL of Alexa 647-transferrin (Invitrogen), the latter to label the
recycling compartment and confirm cell viability. The incubations were
carried out in RPMI culture medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (Hyclone), 1% L-glutamine (Invitrogen) in the presence of 10 Ag/mL
leupeptin (Roche), and 5 Amol/L of pepstatin (Roche) to inhibit lysosomal

degradation. Primary antibodies were then detected postfixation using Cy3
anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson), and processed and photographed as previously described (18).
Rat safety and pharmacokinetic studies. Rat studies were conducted
at Genentech in compliance with NIH guidelines for the care and use of
laboratory animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. Female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 75 to 80 g were
randomized on the basis of weight into groups of six animals each. On study
day 1, animals were given a single intravenous dose of vehicle or anti–CD22MC-vc-PAB-MMAE, anti–CD22-SPP-DM1, anti–CD22-MCC-DM1, or anti–
CD22-MC-MMAF at 2,000 Ag/m2 conjugated cytotoxin (f20 mg/kg ADC),
which was the highest tolerated dose for anti–CD22-SPP-DM1. This dose
was chosen for all compounds in order to assess relative toxicities. The dose
of the cytotoxin, 2,000 Ag/m2, based on body surface area was about 7-fold
higher than the dose used in the efficacy studies in mice. Serum chemistry
and hematology variables were measured pre-dose, on day 5, and on day 12,
and included alanine aminotransferase (ALT), amylase, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK),
g-glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, sodium, potassium, chloride,
calcium, inorganic phosphorous, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose,
total protein, albumin, cholesterol, triglycerides, total bilirubin, WBC count,
RBC count, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, hematocrit, mean
corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, RBC
distribution width, mean platelet volume, platelet count (PLT), absolute
segmented neutrophils (NEUT), absolute lymphocytes, absolute monocytes,
absolute eosinophils, and absolute basophils. Clinical observations and
body weights were also monitored throughout the study.
For pharmacokinetic studies, Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 225 to 250 g
were randomized into groups of four animals each. Rats were dosed with
10 mg/kg of anti–CD22-SPP-DM1 or anti–CD22-MCC-DM1 via the jugular
vein catheter. Blood samples (300 AL) were collected for pharmacokinetic
analysis at 0 (pre-dose) and 3 min; 1, 6, and 24 h; and 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 21, 28,
and 35 days post-dose. Serum samples were analyzed for total antibody and
ADC concentration via ELISA. Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated
with WinNonlin (version 5.0.1, Pharsight Corporation).

Results
Efficacy of uncleavable linker ADCs shows more target
dependence than cleavable linker ADCs. We identified seven
antigens, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD72, CD79b, and CD180 the
expression of which is largely restricted to the B-cell compartment
and are expressed in the majority of NHLs (Table 1; data not
shown; refs. 19–24). Antibodies were identified that were reported,
or found by ourselves (data not shown), to bind cognate antigen in
flow cytometry assays. Using these antibodies, we identified cell
lines that expressed each target and grew reliably with high take
rates in mouse xenograft models. The models shown were not
selected to be responsive to the test agents.
We made SPP-DM1 and MCC-DM1 conjugates of all the
antibodies and tested their efficacy in vivo. We found that all of
the SPP-DM1 (cleavable linker) conjugates (red lines, Figs. 1 and 2)
were effective in the relevant xenograft models as compared with a
control ADC (trastuzumab or anti–gp-120, black lines) that did not
bind the cell line of interest (Figs. 1 and 2). The absence of activity
with control conjugates indicates that the activity seen with the
targeted conjugates is specific, for example, it is not due to
systemic release of free drug. In several cases, tumors were not only
inhibited, but also completely regressed by certain ADCs. These
data indicate that all of these surface antigens are potentially
effective targets for ADCs. The cleavable SPP-DM1 conjugates
worked even with antibodies against targets that are very poorly
internalized such as CD20, CD21, and CD72 (Fig. 3), suggesting
that SPP-DM1 ADCs have broad efficacy and are relatively

By contrast, only the ADCs targeted to CD79b and CD22
were effective with the uncleavable linker MCC-DM1 conjugates
(blue lines, Figs. 1D and 2B).

In light of the relative specificity for the MCC-DM1 ADCs

models and found that all four ADCs were able to regress or
eliminate the tumors (Fig. 4).
CD79b and CD22 are expressed only in the B-cell compartment
and are both expressed on the surface of most NHL cells (21, 23).
Furthermore, ADCs targeted against CD22 or CD79b worked with
all linker-drug combinations tested, suggesting that these two
antigens are particularly robust and attractive targets.
ADCs with uncleavable linkers exhibit reduced toxicity in
rats when compared with cleavable linkers. ADCs with
uncleavable linkers might be expected to be better tolerated than
ADCs with cleavable linkers, as they should release less drug into
systemic circulation, reducing the risk of toxicity (7, 8). However,
this may not necessarily be the case, as even uncleavable linker
ADCs are metabolized and may result in bioconcentration of the
cytotoxin or its metabolites. We therefore evaluated the toxicity of
ADCs with uncleavable and cleavable linker-drug combinations in
rats. We used anti-CD22 conjugated to the maytansinoids, SPPDM1 (cleavable) and MCC-DM1 (uncleavable); and the auristatins,
MC-vc-PAB-MMAE (cleavable) and MC-MMAF (uncleavable), as
these linker-drug combinations are already in or likely to soon
enter the clinic for indications other than NHL (25). The anti-CD22

www.aacrjournals.org

antibody does not bind rat CD22 (data not shown), so the results
should reflect the systemic toxicity of ADCs in general, rather than
the effects of targeting the ADC to specific tissues. Rats were
chosen for these safety studies instead of mice, as it has been
shown that mice are unusually tolerant of some small molecule
tubulin inhibitors (26), and indeed, we observed no weight loss or
other adverse effects of ADC dosing in our mouse models. Rats
were given a single intravenous dose of each ADC at 2,000 Ag
conjugated cytotoxic drug/m2 (f20 mg ADC/kg) and were
observed for 12 days. Only anti–CD22-SPP-DM1 had a negative
effect on body weights (Fig. 5A), indicative of toxicity. Hematology
and serum chemistry, evaluated 5 and 12 days post-dosing,
identified hepatic and hematologic toxicities in the two cleavable
linker groups, anti–CD22-SPP-DM1 and anti–CD22-MC-vc-PABMMAE. Specifically, serum liver enzymes, ALT and AST, and
cholesterol (data not shown) levels were mildly and transiently
increased 5 days post-dosing in these cleavable linker groups. By
contrast, no elevations were seen over baseline or over historical
reference ranges for the groups given anti–CD22-MCC-DM1 and
anti–CD22-MC-MMAF (Fig. 5B; Table S1). In addition, g-glutamyl
transferase and total bilirubin were elevated in the group given

anti–CD22-SPP-DM1 (data not shown). The two groups given the
cleavable linkers also developed decreases in WBC and absolute
neutrophil counts on day 5 (Fig. 5B; Table S1) and decreases in RBC
mass, hemoglobin, and hematocrit on day 12 (data not shown).
Decreases in platelet counts were observed 5 days post-dosing in
the group given anti–CD22-SPP-DM1 and 12 days post-dosing in
the group given anti–CD22-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE (Fig. 5B; Table S1).
In contrast, the ADCs with uncleavable linkers, MCC-DM1 and
MC-MMAF, caused no significant hematologic effects compared
with the control group, suggesting that they are much better
tolerated than ADCs with cleavable linkers. All other clinical
pathology variables (see Materials and Methods) in the ADC-dosed
groups were no different from the vehicle-dosed control group.
Pharmacokinetics of cleavable and uncleavable linker ADCs.
We hypothesized that the ADCs with uncleavable linkers, anti–
CD22-MCC-DM1 and anti–CD22-MC-MMAF, were better tolerated
because they released smaller amounts of free drug or small
molecule metabolites. Another possible reason is that the
uncleavable linker ADCs were cleared faster resulting in less
exposure to the ADC and metabolites. To test these ideas, we
performed pharmacokinetic assays on the four ADCs, measuring

total antibody (which includes both the ADC and the unconjugated
antibody) and drug-conjugated antibody. We found that the total
antibody clearance was similar for both cleavable and uncleavable
conjugates, suggesting that the type of linker has a minimal effect
on the metabolism of the antibody (Fig. 5C and D). However,
whereas the (drug-loaded) uncleavable linker conjugates cleared
with similar kinetics as the total antibody, the cleavable linker
conjugates lost drug more quickly, particularly SPP-DM1. This
suggests that the cleavable linker ADCs release more free cytotoxic
drug (or metabolites thereof) into the circulation. The correlation
of drug loss from the antibody to hepatic and hematologic
toxicities with the cleavable linker ADCs suggests that the reason
that the uncleavable linkers are better tolerated than their
cleavable counterparts is their decreased systemic release of free
drug.

Discussion
We examined seven potential ADC targets for the treatment of
NHL, and in all cases, the cleavable-linker ADC SPP-DM1 was

effective in xenograft models. Our observation that SPP-DM1 ADCs
have activity even when the antibodies to the targets are poorly
internalized seems to be a general characteristic of cleavable-linker
ADCs with membrane-permeable drugs. For example, CD21 is
poorly internalized (Supplemental Fig. S1; Fig. 3), yet anti–CD21MC-vc-PAB-MMAE was effective in our model. Similarly, others
have shown an anti–CD20-AcBut-calicheamicin, which also
recognizes a poorly internalized target (Fig. 3) and uses an acidcleavable linker, is effective in a xenograft model, whereas anti–
CD20-amide-calicheamicin with an uncleavable linker is not (27).
A likely mechanism that would explain why cleavable linkers
are broadly effective and less sensitive to the biology, particularly
the trafficking, of the target, is that following antibody binding, the
linker is cleaved in the extracellular space and free drug
subsequently permeates the cell to reach it’s target. One line of

evidence for this mechanism is shown in Supplemental Fig. S1;
anti–CD21-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE is efficacious, but substitution of
MMAF for MMAE on this conjugate results in an inactive ADC.
MMAF is a more potent drug than MMAE, but is charged and
relatively membrane-impermeable (7); thus, the efficacy of the
MMAE conjugate in this experiment must be due to extracellular
cleavage of the linker followed by cell permeation of the liberated
drug. Although the data presented suggest that cleavable linkers
are broadly active, our data also show that the cleavable linkers are
a double-edged sword; such ADCs are more toxic in an acute
setting. Still, cleavable-linker ADCs are likely to be the format of
choice for many targets, particularly those with less internalization,
lower copy number, or heterogeneous tumor expression (5).
Indeed, the only marketed ADC, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, has
an acid-cleavable linker (28).

We and others (7) have hypothesized that uncleavable linker
ADCs would be safer than ADCs with cleavable linkers. We tested
this in a general way by using a rat model system in which the
antibody was not targeted to any rat antigen, and found that,
indeed, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity
compared with their cleavable counterparts. The faster decrease in
the amount of cleavable linker ADC compared with the total
antibody suggests that this is due to the release of free drug or
linker-drug metabolite(s). In the context of safety, it is also
important to note that there are differences in the metabolites that
arise from cleavable and uncleavable linkers. For example, the
reported metabolite of Ab-MCC-DM1 is lysine-MCC-DM1, a
charged molecule that is relatively impermeant to cells (8). If
released into the circulation, this molecule would presumably
permeate normal tissues to a lesser extent than free DM1, for
example. Thus, the increased safety of uncleavable linkers observed
in this study could be a combination of both reduced drug release
as well as differing properties of the metabolites.
Although cleavable SPP-DM1 resulted in efficacy in vivo when
conjugated to antibodies to all seven NHL targets, uncleavable
linker MCC-DM1 ADCs were only effective when targeted to two
of them, CD22 and CD79b. These data suggest that ADCs
targeted to CD22 and CD79b would be effective with a wide
range of linker-drugs. However, it remains possible that the
other antigens we tested could also be effective targets for
uncleavable linker ADCs because different antibodies to the
same target can sometimes lead to different efficacies (18), and
other linker-drug combinations could result in greater efficacies
than MCC-DM1. Thus, the right combination of antibody, linker,
and drug could lead to an efficacious uncleavable ADC directed
to one of the other antigens. CD19 and CD180, which are highly

internalized, would seem to be the most promising antigens in
this regard.
The work presented here suggests that anti–CD22-MCC-DM1,
anti–CD22-MC-MMAF, anti–CD79b-MCC-DM1, and anti–CD79bMC-MMAF are excellent candidates for the treatment for NHL.
We have recently detailed the efficacy of anti–CD79b-MCC-DM1
and anti–CD79b-MC-MMAF (18) and found that these ADCs have
significant efficacy in xenograft models of NHL. Our data also
show that anti-CD22 and anti-CD79b ADCs with uncleavable
linkers have potent efficacy and acceptable safety profiles in
animal studies, and suggest that for specific targets, uncleavable
linkers provide an opportunity to improve the therapeutic index
of ADCs. It will be important to assess if the differences reported
here are supported by additional future toxicology studies in a
binding species and for extended dosing periods as anticipated
for clinical use.
