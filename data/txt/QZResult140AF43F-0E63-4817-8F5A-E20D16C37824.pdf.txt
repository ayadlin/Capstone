Abstract
Timosaponin A-III (TAIII), a saponin isolated from the
rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides, exhibits potent
cytotoxicity and has the potential to be developed as an
anticancer agent. Here, we provide evidence that TAIII
induces autophagy in HeLa cells followed by apoptotic cell
death. TAIII-induced autophagy was morphologically characterized by the formation of membrane-bound autophagic
vacuoles recognizable at the ultrastructural level. TAIIItreated cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)–
labeled microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3
(LC3) displayed punctate fluorescence indicative of LC3
recruitment to the autophagosome. This was associated
with the conversion of LC3-I (the cytosolic form) into LC3-II
(the lipidated form located on the autophagosome
membrane). TAIII treatment also induced mitochondrial
dysfunction involving overproduction of reactive oxygen
species and reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential
accompanied by induction of mitochondrial permeability
transition. Prolonged exposure to TAIII resulted in cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation, events that
signified the onset of apoptotic cell death. TAIII-induced
autophagy preceded apoptosis, as evidenced by early
autophagic vacuole formation, GFP-LC3 translocation,
and LC3-II increase in the absence of caspase-3 cleavage.
Notably, TAIII-mediated apoptotic cell death was potentiated
by treatment with autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine
or small interfering RNA against the autophagic gene beclin
1. These findings suggest that TAIII-elicited autophagic
response plays a protective role that impedes the eventual
cell death. In terms of structure-activity relationship, the
sugar chain in TAIII is indispensable to the drug action, as
the sugar-lacking aglycone sarsasapogenin did not induce
autophagy and exhibited weaker cytotoxicity. [Cancer Res

components, is a traditional Chinese medicine reported to be
efficacious in treating diabetes and inhibiting platelet aggregation
(3). A notable saponin isolated from A. asphodeloides is timosaponin A-III (TAIII), a spirostanol saponin consisting of a
disaccharide moiety attached to the C3 position of the aglycone
sarsasapogenin (Fig. 1A). Sarsasapogenin does not have the double
bond at C5 and C6 and structurally resembles the aglycones of
dioscin and polyphyllin D, which were previously reported to
exhibit anticancer activities (1, 2). TAIII was shown to suppress
arachidonic acid–induced superoxide generation in human neutrophils (4) and increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in
endothelial cells (5). Nevertheless, the anticancer potential of TAIII
has not been explored.
The mode of cytotoxic action of anticancer drugs often
involves the induction of programmed cell death (PCD).
Apoptosis (type I PCD) is characterized by chromatin condensation, nuclear breakdown, DNA fragmentation, and activation of
caspases. Autophagy (type II PCD) is a highly conserved process
in eukaryotic cells from yeast to mammals (6). In autophagy,
bulk cytoplasm including cellular organelles such as mitochondria, fractured endoplasmic reticulum, and peroxisomes is
sequestered by a phagophore, which encloses and develops into
a double- or multi-membrane autophagosome. On fusion with
lysosome, the autophagosome further develops into an autolysosome, where the cellular constituents are degraded by lysosomal
hydrolases (7). Autophagy is recognized as a cellular process by
which the cytoplasmic materials such as damaged organelles or
long-lived proteins are degraded and recycled into energy and
nutrients when cells are stressed by hypoxia (8), radiation (9, 10),
chemical insults (11–14), or nutritional deprivation (15). The
importance of autophagy is also reflected by its involvement in
human pathologies such as muscular disorders (16), aging (17),
and neurodegenerative diseases (18). A number of anticancer
drugs such as arsenic trioxide (11), tamoxifen (19), and mTOR
inhibitor rapamycin (20) are, in fact, effective autophagy-inducing
agents.
Here we show for the first time that TAIII induced autophagy in
HeLa cells, followed by mitochondria-dependent apoptotic cell
death. TAIII-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, as shown by
increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduction of
mitochondrial membrane potential (Dw m), induction of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), release of cytochrome c, and
activation of caspase-3, seems to be instrumental in triggering
autophagy/apoptosis. The inhibition of autophagy by treatment
with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or beclin 1 small interfering RNA
(siRNA) sensitized the cells to apoptosis, revealing that TAIIIinduced autophagy is protective in nature and precedes the
apoptotic cell death. Our findings suggest that TAIII is a potent
cytotoxic saponin that can be added to the emerging list of
autophagy-inducing agents with potential to be developed as
cancer chemotherapeutic agents.

whereas the aglycone sarsasapogenin (SSG) exhibits relatively weaker cytotoxic
effect to HeLa cancer cells. A, TAIII consists of hydrophobic (spirostanol
aglycone, sarsasapogenin) and hydrophilic (disaccharide) moieties. B, the
cytotoxic effects of TAIII in HepG2, MCF-7, SUNE-1, and HeLa cancer cell lines
and the cytotoxic effect of sarsasapogenin in HeLa cells after 48-h incubation
were determined using MTT assay. *, P < 0.05, compared with the IC50 of TAIII
treatment in HeLa cells.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. All reagents were of analytic grade (purity > 98%) and were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. unless otherwise specified.
TAIII and cyclosporin A were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, Ltd. TAIII was purified before biological use. TAIII and
sarsasapogenin dissolved in DMSO were used as stock solutions. Cell
culture medium constituents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.
Cell Proliferation Kit I (MTT) was purchased from Roche. The antibody
against microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) was from
Abgent; antibodies against Beclin 1, caspase-9, caspase-3, and cytochrome c
were from Cell Signaling Technology; the antibody against actin was from
Abcam.
Cell lines and cell culture. HeLa, HepG2, and MCF-7 cell lines were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in
minimum essential medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%),
nonessential amino acids (0.1 mmol/L), L-glutamine (2 mmol/L), penicillin
(100 units/mL), and streptomycin (100 Ag/mL). SUNE-1 was provided by
Prof. S.W. Tsao (Department of Anatomy, The University of Hong Kong,
Hong Kong, SAR, China) and maintained in supplemented RPMI 1640.
Cultures were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2
at 37jC.
Cell viability assay. Cells (8  103 per well) were seeded in
supplemented culture medium (100 AL/well) in 96-well plates and
incubated for 24 h. Then the medium was replaced with a drug-containing

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (24). December 15, 2008

medium, and the cells were further incubated for 24 to 48 h. All experiments
were run in parallel with controls (0.2% DMSO) and the cell viabilities were
evaluated by MTT assays. The absorbance of formazan formed was
measured at 580 nm by a microplate analyzer (Perkin-Elmer Fusion a-FP).
Transmission electron microscopy. HeLa cells treated with DMSO,
TAIII, or sarsasapogenin were collected by trypsinization, washed twice
with PBS, and then fixed with 0.5 mL of ice-cold glutaraldehyde (2.5% in
0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) at 4jC overnight. After washing, cells
were postfixed in OsO4 (0.5 mL, 1%) and embedded in Polybed resin.
Ultrathin sections were doubly stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate
and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (208S Philips).
Examination of LC3 translocation. HeLa cells (1  105) were plated in
35-mm glass-bottomed dishes with supplemented culture medium and
incubated for 24 h. Cells were transfected with green fluorescent protein
(GFP)–labeled LC3 (1 Ag) using the GeneJuice transfection reagent
(Novagen) and incubated for another 24 h for the expression of GFP-LC3
fusion protein. The localization of LC3 in transfected cells was examined by
fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 200M).
Immunoblotting. TAIII-treated HeLa cells were lysed with a solution
containing Tris-HCl (100 mmol/L, pH 6.8), SDS (4% w/v), glycerol (20%), and
dithiothreitol (20 mmol/L), supplemented with protease inhibitor and
nuclease mix. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000  g for 30 min. Equal
amounts of the protein (50 Ag) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5%) and
transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilion-P). The
membrane was blocked with a buffer containing Tris (10 mmol/L, pH 7.4),
NaCl (150 mmol/L), Tween 20 (0.1%), and bovine serum albumin (5%) and
then incubated with the primary antibodies at 4jC overnight. The
membrane was washed and treated with appropriate secondary antibody
for 2 h. The immunoreactivities were detected with the enhanced
chemiluminescence plus kit (GE Healthcare). Cytosolic fractions for
cytochrome c detection were obtained with a reagent kit (Pierce). Actins
were probed to ensure equal protein loading.
Determination of ROS levels. Intracellular ROS were determined by
measuring the intracellular oxidation of nonfluorescent dihydrorhodamine123 (DHRh-123) to green fluorescent rhodamine-123 (Rh-123). Cells (8  103
per well) were cultured in 96-well black-bottomed plates for 24 h. TAIII was
added for the indicated time points. Cells were washed once with HBSS and
incubated with DHRh-123 (5 Amol/L) in HBSS for 30 min. After washing, the
cell-associated fluorescence was measured with a microplate analyzer with
excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 530 nm, respectively.
Determination of superoxide dismutase and catalase activities.
Experiments were done according to the manufacturer’s protocols
(Cayman). Briefly, HeLa cells (1  106) were seeded in 100-mm dishes
with supplemented culture medium and incubated overnight. Cells treated
with DMSO or TAIII were harvested at the specified time, washed with PBS,
and pelleted by centrifugation at 500  g for 5 min. The cell pellet was
sonicated in 1 mL of ice-cold buffer [50 mmol/L potassium phosphate
(pH 7.0) containing 1 mmol/L EDTA] and centrifuged at 10,000  g at 4jC
for 15 min. The supernatant was collected for protein determination and
superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase analyses.
Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (#y m). The
mitochondrial membrane potential probe, Rh-123, is taken up by
mitochondria and fluoresces in a Dw m-dependent manner. Cells (8  103
per well) were cultured in 96-well black-bottomed plate for 24 h. TAIII was
added for the indicated time intervals. Cells were washed once with HBSS
and then incubated with Rh-123 (1 Amol/L) in HBSS for 30 min. After
washing, Rh-123 fluorescence was measured using a microplate analyzer
with excitation and emission wavelengths at 488 and 530 nm, respectively.
Localization of mitochondrial ROS and detection of MPT. HeLa cells
(4  105) were cultured in glass-bottomed dishes with supplemented culture
medium and incubated for 24 h. Cells were treated with DMSO or TAIII
(10 Amol/L) for 6 h and stained with MitoTracker Red (50 nmol/L, Molecular
Probes) for 2 min at 37jC and washed. For ROS localization, cells were
stained with 2¶,7¶-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA; 15 Amol/L) for 2 min
at 37jC. For MPT detection, cells were incubated with calcein-AM (1 Amol/L,
Molecular Probes) and CoCl2 (5 mmol/L) for 15 min at 37jC. After washing
with PBS, cell images were examined under a fluorescence microscope.

TAIII Induces Autophagy Followed by Apoptosis
Excitation and emission wavelengths were, respectively, 551 and 576 nm for
MitoTracker Red and 490 and 525 nm for DCFDA and calcein-AM.
Beclin 1 siRNA transfection. Briefly, HeLa cells (5  105 per well) were
seeded in six-well plates and incubated overnight. Random siRNA or beclin 1
siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1.25 Ag/well) was transfected using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
After 48 h, cells were collected, followed by immunoblot analysis, 4¶-6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, or cell viability determination.
DAPI staining. Beclin 1 siRNA–transfected HeLa cells were treated with
DMSO or TAIII for 24 h. Both attached and floating cells were pooled, rinsed
with PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol for 20 min, and then stained with DAPI
(1.0 Ag/mL) for 15 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then
mounted onto slides. Cell morphology was examined under a fluorescence
microscope. Moderately fluorescent and round nuclei were considered
normal. Bright and condensed/fragmented nuclei were regarded as
apoptotic.
Statistical analysis. Data were expressed as the mean F SE of three
determinations. Statistical analyses were done by using two-tailed Student’s
t test. P V 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
TAIII is cytotoxic to cancer cells. TAIII exhibited cytotoxicity
toward a panel of carcinoma cell lines including hepatocellular
carcinoma cells (HepG2), human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7),
human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells (SUNE-1), and human
cervical epithelioid carcinoma cells (HeLa). The IC50 values ranged
from 8.5 to 10.1 Amol/L after 48-hour incubation as determined by
MTT assay. Sarsasapogenin was somewhat less cytotoxic with an
IC50 of 56.4 Amol/L for HeLa cancer cells (Fig. 1B).
Autophagic vacuoles are observed in TAIII-treated cells.
Inspection of TAIII-treated cells under a light microscope revealed
the presence of microscopic vacuoles, which formed as early as 12
hours posttreatment (Fig. 2A). The number and size of the
vacuoles increased progressively with the treatment time. The
formation of vacuoles mediated by TAIII was not confined to
HeLa cells but was also observed in HepG2 and SUNE-1 cancer
cells. However, vacuoles were hardly observed in HeLa cells
treated with sarsasapogenin. The ultrastructural details in TAIIItreated cells at 48 hours posttreatment were further examined by
transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 2B). The formation of
vacuoles was apparent when compared with DMSO control or
sarsasapogenin-treated cells. The majority of vacuoles resemble
autophagic vacuoles (autophagosomes and autolysosomes) and
some of these presumably are membrane bound and contained
cytoplasmic contents (21). These features are distinct from
apoptotic cells, which are expected to exhibit cell shrinkage,
nuclear fragmentation, and chromatin condensation (15). Careful
examination of the transmission electron microscopy images
revealed that some cells simultaneously possessed morphologies
typical of both autophagy (autophagic vacuoles) and apoptosis
(apoptotic nuclear condensation).
TAIII induces cellular translocation of LC3. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast atg8, is essential for autophagosome
formation (22). The intracellular localization of LC3 in autophagic
vacuoles induced by TAIII can be studied by transient transfection
of cells with an expression plasmid of GFP-LC3 (23, 24).
Fluorescence microscopic examinations were done at different
time points to trace the redistribution of LC3 during autophagosome and autolysosome formations. In the DMSO control and
sarsasapogenin-treated cells (Fig. 2C), GFP-LC3 was found
predominantly as diffuse green fluorescence in the cytoplasm.
However, in TAIII-treated cells, characteristic punctate fluorescent

www.aacrjournals.org

patterns were observed, indicating the recruitment of GFP-LC3
during autophagosome formation (9, 14, 22). The punctate feature
representing the autophagosome gradually faded and finally
vanished, presumably due to the fusion of autophagosome with
lysosome (23), resulting in less GFP-LC3 located on the membrane.
The incidence of autophagy induced by TAIII was quantified
(Fig. 2C). The number of cells with punctate green fluorescence
increased significantly with the treatment time of TAIII, indicating
that TAIII mediated autophagy in a time-dependent manner.
TAIII induces LC3-II accumulation. LC3 exists in two forms.
LC3-I residing in the cytosol is posttranslationally modified to the
membrane-bound LC3-II, which is a structural component
essential for autophagosome formation during autophagy (22).
Immunoblot analyses of proteins from TAIII-treated cells revealed
the presence of two bands, LC3-I and LC3-II (Fig. 2D). Weak bands
corresponding to LC3-I were found in the DMSO controls whereas
LC3-II was undetectable. The modification of LC3-I to LC3-II
correlating to the extent of autophagosome formation (22) was
observed as early as 12 hours posttreatment with 10 Amol/L TAIII.
The degree of LC3-I to LC3-II conversion was initially low but
significantly enhanced thereafter. The total LC3 expression levels
were higher when TAIII treatment was prolonged or the dosages of
TAIII were increased.
The increase in LC3-II expression can be associated with either
an enhanced formation of autophagosome or an impaired
autophagic degradation (25). To differentiate these two possibilities, LC3-II expression was assessed in the presence of bafilomycin
A1, an inhibitor of V-ATPase that interferes with the fusion of
autophagosome and lysosome and hence blocks the autophagic
degradation including that of LC3-II (25). As shown in Fig. 2D, cells
treated with TAIII or rapamycin, a prototypical autophagy inducer,
had their LC3-II further accumulated in the presence of
bafilomycin A1. These observations supported that the increased
LC3-II expression mediated by TAIII was a consequence of
exacerbated autophagosome formation. More importantly, these
findings also indicated that TAIII might induce a complete
autophagic flux.
TAIII induces oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is mediated by
excessive ROS such as superoxide anion radical (O2 ) and hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2). The accumulation of these oxygen-derived species
has been reported to promote cell death during autophagy and/or
apoptosis (26–29). To examine whether oxidative stress was
involved in TAIII-stimulated autophagy, we measured the intracellular ROS levels over a 48-hour period using cell permeable probe
DHRh-123. As shown in Fig. 3A, untreated cells showed relatively
constant basal levels of ROS whereas the TAIII-treated cells showed
time- and dose-dependent elevations in ROS production. When
cells were pretreated with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC),
ROS production was substantially inhibited.
SOD and catalase activities are up-regulated during TAIII
treatment. The balance between ROS production and the capability
of antioxidant defense system determines the extent of oxidative
stress. SOD and catalase are essential enzymatic antioxidants
capable of removing O2  and H2O2, respectively. In this work,
significant increases in SOD activities were evident during the course
of TAIII treatment (Fig. 3B). Catalase activities were also correspondingly increased (Fig. 3B). However, overproduction of ROS was
still observed (Fig. 3A) and the cellular antioxidant capacity seemed
to be overwhelmed and oxidative stress might result.
NAC inhibits TAIII-mediated autophagy. The excessive ROS
production has been suggested to play a role in the initiation of

autophagy (17, 26). Hence, the antioxidative effect of NAC on TAIIImediated autophagy was examined. The formation of microscopic
vacuoles in TAIII-treated cells was significantly attenuated in the
presence of NAC (Supplementary Fig. S1). NAC treatment also
inhibited TAIII-mediated LC3-II expression as shown in Fig. 3C,
providing evidence that ROS might stimulate the onset of autophagy.
Mitochondria are the sources of ROS generation. The source
of ROS production in TAIII treatment is unclear but likely originated

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (24). December 15, 2008

from mitochondrial respiratory activities. Therefore, the intracellular localization of ROS was examined by doubly staining cells with
mitochondria-specific fluorescent marker MitoTracker Red and
DCFDA. DCFDA is cell permeable and reacts preferentially with
H2O2 to give fluorescent 2¶,7¶-dichlorofluorescin (DCF; ref. 26). As
shown in Fig. 3D, TAIII-treated cells exhibited green punctate
fluorescence of DCF whereas untreated cells showed substantially
weaker signals. The merged DCF and MitoTracker Red image in

TAIII Induces Autophagy Followed by Apoptosis

TAIII-treated cells showed a perfect overlap of fluorescence signals
indicated by the orange coloration. These observations suggested
that mitochondria were the sites of ROS overproduction.
TAIII decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential
(#y m). Autophagic activity is involved in the removal of damaged
organelles such as mitochondria (17, 21). To test whether
mitochondrial perturbation was associated with TAIII-mediated
autophagy, the mitochondrial membrane potential was measured
using Rh-123, which is a lipophilic cation taken up by mitochondrial inner membrane and fluoresces in proportion to Dw m. As
shown in Fig. 4A, the control showed fairly constant Dw m values
whereas TAIII induced a time- and dose-dependent decrease in
Dw m, evident as early as 2 hours posttreatment. Pretreatment with
NAC did not affect the loss of Dw m (data not shown). These
findings suggested that TAIII-mediated loss of Dw m was an early
event and independent of ROS production.
TAIII induces MPT. The loss of Dw m may indicate an increase
in MPT (30–32), which causes an increase in the membrane
permeability to solutes with molecular mass <1.5 kDa. To test
whether induction of MPT was associated with TAIII-mediated
reduction in Dw m, cells were treated with TAIII for 6 hours and the
MPT was detected by an established method involving fluorescence
staining with MitoTracker Red, calcein-AM, and CoCl2 (33). In this

method, calcein-AM is used as a membrane-permeable probe that
can freely enter mitochondria. The exit of green fluorescent calcein
from mitochondria, after being cleaved by intracellular esterases, is
allowed only through the induction of MPT. Co2+ ions cannot
readily enter mitochondria, but can be present in the cytoplasm
and nucleus and quenches the calcein fluorescence therein as a
result of Co2+-calcein complex formation. In the presence of Co2+,
predominately the fluorescence of calcein trapped in mitochondria
is imageable. Thus, as depicted in Fig. 4B, mitochondria in
untreated cells accumulated calcein and were recognized as
filamentous green fluorescence. The calcein signals in untreated
cells could also be colocalized with the MitoTracker Red–labeled
mitochondria, yielding a greenish-yellow coloration when the two
images were merged. However, TAIII treatment resulted in loss of
mitochondrial calcein fluorescence. In addition, the calcein and
MitoTracker Red signals in TAIII-treated cells did not overlap well
and the merged image was predominately MitoTracker Red signals.
These observations could be interpreted as leakage of calcein from
the mitochondria (33) resulting from induction of MPT by TAIII
treatment. When cells were cotreated with TAIII and cyclosporin A,
an inhibitor of MPT (28), the mitochondrial calcein was largely
retained. Collectively, these observations illustrated that TAIII
induced cyclosporin A–sensitive MPT.

Figure 3. TAIII induces oxidative stress, which contributes to autophagy in HeLa cells. A, ROS levels were determined by fluorescence changes due to intracellular
oxidation of nonfluorescent DHRh-123 to green fluorescent Rh-123. The addition of NAC (4 mmol/L, pretreated for 1 h) inhibited ROS generation. Data are expressed
as fold increases relative to control at time 0. *, P < 0.05, compared with TAIII treatment (10 Amol/L) at the corresponding time points. B, SOD and catalase
activities were determined for cells treated with 10 Amol/L TAIII. * and **, P < 0.05, compared with corresponding control. C, Western blot analysis of LC3-I and
LC3-II expressions in cells treated with 10 Amol/L TAIII for 24 h in the absence or presence of NAC (4 mmol/L, pretreated for 1 h). D, cells treated with 10 Amol/L TAIII
for 6 h were doubly stained with MitoTracker Red and DCFDA. The cell images were observed under a fluorescence microscope. Magnification, 40.

Figure 4. TAIII perturbs HeLa cell mitochondrial activities, which contributes to autophagy. A, changes of Dw m in cells treated with 5 Amol/L or 10 Amol/L of TAIII
were measured as the fluorescence intensity of Rh-123 loaded to the cells. Control value at time 0 is set at 100%. *, P < 0.05, compared with the control at the
corresponding time point. B, cells treated with 10 Amol/L TAIII for 6 h in the absence or presence of cyclosporin A (CsA ; 2 Amol/L, pretreated for 1 h) were loaded
with MitoTracker Red, calcein-AM, and CoCl2 and then imaged by fluorescence microscope. Magnification, 40. C, Western blot analysis showing that the conversion
of LC3-I into LC3-II mediated by TAIII (10 Amol/L, 24 h) was reduced upon cyclosporine A treatment (2 Amol/L, pretreated for 1 h). D, Western blot analyses
showing cytochrome c release into cytosol in cells treated with 10 Amol/L TAIII and caspase-3 expression in cells treated with 5 to 15 Amol/L of TAIII.

Cyclosporin A inhibits TAIII-mediated autophagy. The
collapse of Dw m (Fig. 4A) in association with induction of MPT
(Fig. 4B) in TAIII treatment seemed to be an early event leading to
induction of autophagy. Therefore, the MPT inhibitory effect of
cyclosporin A on autophagy was investigated. The formation of
microscopic vacuoles in TAIII-treated cells was markedly reduced
in the presence of cyclosporin A (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Immunoblot analysis revealed that the conversion of LC3-I into
LC3-II in TAIII-treated cells was also inhibited by cyclosporin A
(Fig. 4C). These results indicated that the TAIII-elicited autophagy
might be associated with an induction of MPT.
Cytochrome c is released and caspase-3 is cleaved after
prolonged treatment with TAIII. Induction of MPT may lead to
mitochondrial swelling, outer membrane rupture, and eventual
release of intermembrane proapoptotic inducing factors such as
cytochrome c (30). This is followed by the activation of caspase-9,
which in turn mediates the cleavage of other executioner caspases
(31). As shown in Fig. 4D, cells treated with TAIII (10 Amol/L)
exhibited a time-dependent release of cytochrome c into cytosol.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (24). December 15, 2008

The release was most evident after prolonged drug treatment
(48 hours). In addition, the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3 in
TAIII-treated cells was undetectable initially but could be detected
after a 48-hour incubation (Fig. 4D), in coincidence with the release
of cytochrome c. These results showed that TAIII treatment
eventually caused apoptosis via an intrinsic mitochondrial
pathway. It is noteworthy that caspase-3 cleavage could be
considered as a late event (f 48 hours) during the TAIII treatment,
following the early induction (12 hours) of autophagic responses
such as autophagic vacuole formation (Fig. 2B ), GFP-LC3
recruitment (Fig. 2C), and LC3-II increase (Fig. 2D).
Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA potentiates TAIII-mediated
apoptotic cell death. The interconnection between TAIII-induced
autophagy and apoptosis was further investigated using autophagy
inhibitor 3-MA. 3-MA is a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor that
exerts its autophagy-inhibiting effect before the formation of
autophagosome during the early stages of autophagy (34). As
depicted in Fig. 5A (and Supplementary Fig. S3), treatment of cells
with 3-MA was effective in inhibiting the GFP-LC3 recruitment to

autophagosome. 3-MA at 10 mmol/L was only slightly toxic
(Fig. 5B) but exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on autophagosome formation, as also noted in previous studies (35–38).
However, the IC50 of TAIII after a 24-hour treatment decreased 5fold from 15.9 to 2.9 Amol/L in the presence of 3-MA (Fig. 5B). At
this early time point, HeLa cells pretreated with 3-MA followed by
TAIII not only showed cell shrinkage (Supplementary Fig. S3) but
also exhibited significant cleavages of the proapoptotic caspase-9
and caspase-3, whereas cells exposed to either compound alone did
not (Fig. 5C). Collectively, these results suggested that 3-MA
inhibited TAIII-mediated autophagy and it also sensitized the cells
to the cytotoxic actions of TAIII with induction of apoptosis.
Inhibition of autophagy by beclin 1 siRNA increases the
cytotoxic sensitivity of cells to TAIII. The gene product of
beclin 1, also known as the mammalian orthologue of yeast
autophagic gene atg6, is a component of class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex essential for autophagosome formation
(35). In this study, the role of autophagy in the TAIII-mediated
cytotoxicity was studied by knocking down the beclin 1
expression using siRNA. The expression of Beclin 1 was markedly
suppressed in HeLa cells transfected with beclin 1 siRNA but not
those with random siRNA (Fig. 6A). Accordingly, cells transfected
with beclin 1 siRNA showed much reduced level of autophagosome formation after TAIII treatment when compared with those
transfected with random siRNA (Fig. 6B; Supplementary Fig. S4),
indicating that beclin 1 promoted TAIII-induced autophagy.
Notably, the IC50 of TAIII was significantly decreased from 16.4
to 11.2 Amol/L by beclin 1 siRNA but not affected by random
siRNA (IC50, 15.7 Amol/L; Fig. 6C). The degree of apoptosis was
also determined by DAPI staining (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Apoptotic cell demise with condensed or fragmented nuclei was
most remarkable in beclin 1 siRNA–transfected cells treated with
TAIII. Quantification of apoptotic cell corpses showed that the
incidence of apoptosis after TAIII treatment was 3-fold more in
beclin 1 siRNA–transfected cells when compared with random
siRNA control (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these findings suggested
that the cytotoxic effect of TAIII was potentiated by downregulation of beclin 1 with enhancement of apoptosis. These
observations supported the notion that autophagy mediated by
TAIII was protective in nature.

Apoptosis was not induced in arsenic trioxide–treated human
glioma cells until autophagic cell death was inhibited by
bafilomycin A1 (11). In contrast, autophagy was triggered only
when apoptosis was blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor in both
neurons and HeLa cells (40).
Inhibition of autophagy by treatment with 3-MA (Fig. 5) or
siRNA against autophagic gene beclin 1 (Fig. 6) enhanced the
apoptotic cell death, suggesting that TAIII-mediated autophagy has
a cytoprotective role in nature. The role of autophagy in cancer
cells has emerged as an important topic of intense debate, with
opinions split on whether it acts as a self-defensive or a selfdestructive mechanism. Cancer cells undergoing nutrient starvation (7), hypoxia (8), ionizing radiation (9, 10), temozolomide (12),

Discussion
A. asphodeloides is listed in Chinese Pharmacopoeia and has
been widely used in China and Japan for medicinal purposes due to
its rich content of saponins (3, 4). In the present study, we report
that the naturally occurring saponin TAIII from A. asphodeloides is
a strong inducer to autophagy (Fig. 2) as well as to apoptosis (Fig.
4). These two processes, autophagy and apoptosis, although
mechanistically different, are sequentially triggered by TAIII via
the mitochondria-dependent pathway (Figs. 3 and 4). From the
literature, the switch between autophagy and apoptosis is
complicated and poorly defined. Autophagy and apoptosis can be
induced in response to cellular stresses in a number of ways such
that the induction of autophagy/apoptosis can occur sequentially,
simultaneously, or in a mutually exclusive manner (11, 14, 39, 40). It
has been shown through a gene expression profiling approach that
autophagy and apoptosis occurred concomitantly, wherein multiple apoptotic genes were up-regulated together with autophagic
genes (39). Defensive autophagy was induced in sulforaphanetreated human prostate cancer cells to antagonize apoptosis (14).

and sulforaphane (14) treatments manifested the defensive role of
autophagy in contrast to the destructive role displayed by arsenic
trioxide– (11), resveratrol- (13), tamoxifen- (19), and ceramideinduced (41) autophagy. All these arguments about the role of
autophagy in cancer cells have received supports (6, 21). Shintani
and Klionsky (15) suggested that the consequences of autophagy
are dependent on the physiologic contexts.
In this study, TAIII treatment markedly induced ROS
production, which has been suggested to be essential for both
autophagy and apoptosis (26, 27). The origin of the TAIIImediated overproduction of ROS (Fig. 3A) is unclear but may be
related to the drug-induced dysfunction of mitochondria, which
were the major sites of intracellular ROS production (Fig. 3D).
On the other hand, a rapid loss of Dw m (Fig. 4A) was also
detected early during the TAIII treatment, paralleled by the
activation of MPT (Fig. 4B). The mechanism by which TAIIIinduced mitochondrial membrane destabilization may be due to
the membrane-perturbing property of this spirostanol saponin
(42, 43). The hydrophobic aglycone (sarsasapogenin) in TAIII
probably aids in traversing the membrane and affects the
mitochondrial functions (44). The accumulation of ROS and
activation of MPT during TAIII treatment may jointly initiate
autophagic response as suggested by the observations that
antioxidant (NAC) or MPT inhibitor (cyclosporin A) suppressed
the autophagy induction (Figs. 3C and 4C). Although the signal
transduction pathway leading to activation of autophagy is not
fully resolved, it has been reported that ROS, particularly H2O2,
are signaling molecules essential for starvation-induced autophagy. The cysteine protease HsAtg4 has been shown to be a direct
target for oxidation by H2O2 (26).
According to Lemasters’s model (28, 29), the promotion of MPT
is a crucial factor controlling the cellular fate by adopting
autophagy or apoptosis. Therefore, we hypothesize that during
the early stages of TAIII treatment, the degree of MPT induced is
relatively low, and thus self-defensive autophagy occurs for

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (24). December 15, 2008

turnover of damaged mitochondria. However, after TAIII treatment
is prolonged or the dosage is increased, the augmented MPT
attains a ‘‘threshold,’’ at which time autophagy is extensive and
followed by apoptosis. The defensive effect exerted by autophagy is
then diminished and the extent of apoptosis increases (compare
Figs. 2B and 4D). In this respect, autophagy seems to retard the
occurrence of apoptosis. This notion is further supported by our
findings that the inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA or more
specifically by beclin 1 siRNA increased cell sensitivity to TAIIImediated apoptosis (Figs. 5 and 6). Beclin 1, probably the first
identified mammalian gene with a role in mediating autophagy
(35), is monoallelically deleted in 40% to 75% of sporadic human
breast cancers and ovarian cancers (45). On the other hand, Beclin
1 protein has been reported to form complex with antiapoptotic
protein CED-9/Bcl-2, and on its down-regulation by siRNA,
apoptosis is triggered (37). Hence, Beclin 1 seems to be a tumor
suppressor having a role in connecting autophagic and apoptotic
machineries. The release of cytochrome c into the cytosol in TAIIItreated cells (Fig. 4D) owing to the disruption of mitochondrial
membrane signals the onset of apoptosis. The released cytochrome
c binds to the adaptor molecule Apaf-1 to form the apoptosome
complex that activates caspase-9, leading to cleavage of caspase-3
(Fig. 4D), the ‘‘executioner’’ protease of apoptosis (30, 46). The
release of cytochrome c is therefore a critical point, after which
autophagy progresses irreversibly to apoptosis.
The connectivity between autophagy and apoptosis in TAIII
treatment is regulated by mitochondrial activities (Figs. 3 and 4).
Overproduction of ROS, disruption of mitochondrial membrane,
induction of cyclosporin A–sensitive MPT, and cytochrome c
release are all consistent with the inner mitochondrial membrane
being the possible molecular target of TAIII (44). Molecular
docking has been used to investigate the possible interactions
between TAIII/sarsasapogenin and the inner membrane-associated components of the MPT pore, such as cyclophilin D.
Preliminary data show that TAIII can be docked into cyclophilin

D whereas sarsasapogenin cannot. Sarsasapogenin lacks sugar
moiety, and this may possibly explain its insignificant induction of
autophagy and relatively weak cytotoxicity. Further experiments
are warranted to examine the presumed interaction between
TAIII/sarsasapogenin and cyclophilin D.
In conclusion, our study showed that the natural substance TAIII
is an autophagy- and apoptosis-inducing agent to cancer cells.
However, such dual properties possessed by TAIII have not been
reported for other saponins such as dioscin and polyphyllin D. This
represents a challenging task for medicinal chemists to work out
the relationship between saponin structures and bioactivities. The
interaction of saponin with mitochondrial membrane components
will be of particular interest.
