ABSTRACT
Chromosome instability (CIN) in solid tumours results in multiple numerical and
structural chromosomal aberrations and is associated with poor prognosis in multiple
tumour types. Recent evidence demonstrated CEP17 duplication, a CIN marker, is a
predictive marker of anthracycline benefit. An analysis of the BR9601 and MA.5 clinical
trials was performed to test the role of existing CIN gene expression signatures as
predictive markers of anthracycline sensitivity in breast cancer.
Univariate analysis demonstrated, high CIN25 expression score was associated
with improved distant relapse free survival (DRFS) (HR: 0.74, 95% CI 0.54-0.99, p
= 0.046). High tumour CIN70 and CIN25 scores were associated with aggressive
clinicopathological phenotype and increased sensitivity to anthracycline therapy
compared to low CIN scores. However, in a prospectively planned multivariate analysis
only pathological grade, nodal status and tumour size were significant predictors of
outcome for CIN25/CIN70. A limited gene signature was generated, patients with low
tumour CIN4 scores benefited from anthracycline treatment significantly more than
those with high CIN4 scores (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.56, p = 0.001). In multivariate
analyses the treatment by marker interaction for CIN4/anthracyclines demonstrated
hazard ratio of 0.35 (95% CI 0.15-0.80, p = 0.012) for DRFS. This data shows CIN4
is independent predictor of anthracycline benefit for DRFS in breast cancer.

RESULTS

breast cancer. Significant resources have been devoted
to developing markers that may predict anthracycline
benefit (HER2, TOP2A, Ch17CEP and TIMP1) with
limited success [5-9]. To date Ch17CEP (duplication of
the peri-centromeric α-satellite region of chromosome
17) and TOP2A are the only markers that have shown
consistent results across a number of clinical trials [7-9].
The functional pathways related to anthracycline benefit
in Ch17CEP/TOP2A altered tumours remain unknown.
Research from our group has linked the predictive effect
of CEP17 in vivo to chromosome instability (CIN), which
itself is predictive of anthracycline benefit in the BR9601
trial [10] and in preclinical models.
CIN is a phenotype description of genomic
instability at the karyotypic level that results in multiple
alterations in chromosomal number or structure. Multiple
mechanisms drive CIN, including compromised spindle
assembly checkpoint (SAC), sister chromatid cohesion
defects, additional centrosomes and abnormal spindle
kinetochore attachments. Pre-mitotic mechanisms may
also include defects in DNA repair and replication
pathways. CIN is associated with poor prognosis in many
patients with solid tumours [11-12]. Critically for the
current study, cell lines with high CIN phenotype enter
mitotic catastrophe if challenged with anthracyclines,
possibly as a result of defective SAC and other G2/M
checkpoints [13]. In silico analysis has identified two
mRNA signatures associated with CIN, “CIN25” and
“CIN70”, as predictive of prognosis in a number of
cancer datasets [14]. Furthermore high CIN70 signature
expression was associated with paclitaxel resistance in
ovarian cancers [15]. The CIN70 signature incorporates
many genes whose mRNA expression levels correlate with
proliferation, and have a role in the cell cycle [11].
Our work and that of others support a link
between SAC dysregulation, a potential cause of CIN,
CIN itself [10] and markers of CIN [7-9] and benefit
from anthracycline containing polychemotherapy in
vivo. Preclinical evidence linking CIN to anthracycline
sensitivity support our hypothesis that CIN provides a
potential clinically useful and relevant means of selecting
those patients who are likely to benefit from anthracycline
containing chemotherapy. Successful validation of such
an approach would further support the selective use of
anthracycline based chemotherapy and provide a viable
diagnostic approach to support such selective use.
To further validate the role of existing CIN gene
expression signatures as markers of anthracycline
sensitivity we assessed these gene expression signatures
in a prospectively planned and powered retrospective
analysis of two pivotal clinical trials (BR9601 and
MA.5). In addition we identified a new minimal gene
set encapsulating the predictive value of these assay
and validated its ability to stratify patients according to
anthracycline benefit using clinical outcome.

Correlation
of
CIN25
and
70
and
clinicopathological parameters with clinical
outcomes
We successfully analysed 282 of 321 (87.9%) and
421 of 440 (95.7%) tumours from BR9601 and MA.5,
respectively. High CIN25 and CIN70 scores were defined
as above the median as previously described. In univariate
analysis using continuous clinicopathological biomarkers,
high CIN25 and CIN70 scores were associated with
younger age (p < 0.0001), high tumour grade (p < 0.0001),
PgR negativity (p < 0.0001) and ER negativity (p <
0.0001) but not with tumour size, nodal status or HER2
status.

CIN signatures as prognostic markers for OS and
DRFS
In a preplanned analysis the prognostic significance
of CIN25 and CIN70 was tested on the entire patient
cohort, irrespective of allocated adjuvant chemotherapy or
trial. No significant association between CIN70 expression
and DRFS (HR: 1.14, 95% CI 0.91-1.43, p = 0.273) or
OS (HR: 1.14, 95% CI 0.88-1.45, p = 0.278) was evident.
By contrast, tumours with high CIN25 scores were
associated with reduced DRFS (HR: 1.43, 95%CI 1.111.67, p = 0.004, Figure 2A) and OS (HR: 1.45, 95%CI
1.14-1.85, p = 0.003, Figure 2B). After multivariate
analysis and adjustment for nodal status, grade, size, age,
HER2, ER and PgR status, a high CIN25 score was not an
independent predictor for DRFS or OS.

CIN signatures as predictive markers of
anthracycline benefit
In a preplanned analysis no significant differential
benefit in either DRFS or OS from E-CMF treatment
was demonstrated in univariate analysis between patients
whose tumours had high or low CIN70 expression (Table
1).
In univariate analysis, patients whose tumours had
high CIN25 gene expression scores had an increased
DRFS (HR: 0.74, 95%CI 0.54-0.99, p = 0.046) when
treated with E-CMF compared with patients treated with
CMF alone (Table 1); a similar association was seen
with respect to OS, although this did not reach statistical
significance (HR: 0.76, 95%CI 0.56-1.05, p = 0.095).
Conversely, there was no apparent differential benefit of
E-CMF vs. CMF in patients with low CIN25 scores for
DRFS (HR: 0.85, 95%CI 0.61-1.21, p = 0.374) or OS (HR:
0.87, 95%CI 0.61-1.29, p = 0.535). A multivariate analysis

with adjustment for size, nodal status, ER, pathological
grade, HER2, CIN25, treatment and CIN25 by treatment
interaction showed only pathological grade, nodal status,
tumour size and CEP17 to be significant predictors of
outcome (Table 1).
The hazard ratio for the treatment by marker effect
of CIN25 was 0.86 (95% CI 0.54-1.36, p = 0.519) for
DRFS and 0.86 (95% CI 0.53-1.40, p = 0.549) for OS
(Table 1).

no significant benefit from E-CMF treatment versus CMF
treatment was demonstrated in patients whose tumours
were grade 3 and had low CIN25 gene expression (Table
1). No significant benefit from adjuvant E-CMF versus
CMF was demonstrated in patients with grade I and II
tumours irrespective of CIN25 gene expression scores
(Table 1).
The uncorrected hazard ratio for treatment by
marker effect of CIN25 in grade III tumours was 0.81
(95% CI 0.45-1.46, p = 0.479) for DRFS and 0.78 (95%
CI 0.42-1.43, p = 0.413) for OS (Table 1).

CIN signature as a biological marker for
anthracycline therapy in grade III patients

CIN4 as a predictor for anthracycline benefit

Previous research identified a significant association
between CIN gene expression and grade III tumours
[9]; therefore, an exploratory analysis was performed in
patients with grade III tumours. In univariate analysis,
patients with grade III tumours that had high CIN25 gene
expression scores had longer DRFS (HR: 0.66, 96%CI
0.46-0.94, p = 0.021) and OS (HR: 0.70, 95%CI 0.491.00, p = 0.05) when treated with E-CMF than those
treated with CMF alone (Figure 3, Table 1). By contrast,

In order to select a minimal set of genes that reflects
CIN we used the merged clinical cohort (containing both
BR9601 and MA.5) and applied a bootstrap aggregation
approach to allow a training and validation approach to be
tested (see methods).
A CIN4 score was generated using the expression
values of 4 genes, HDGF, KIAA0286, RFC4 and MSH6,
weighted by their regression coefficients. Patients with

cancers that have a low CIN4 score had superior DRFS
(HR 2.72, 95%CI 1.48-5.02, p = 0.001) and OS (HR
2.00, 95%CI 1.09-3.69, p = 0.03) when treated with the
anthracycline compared to CMF alone (Figure 4). In
multivariate analysis, the hazard ratio for treatment marker
effect of CIN4 was 0.35 (95% CI 0.15-0.79, p = 0.01) for
DRFS and 0.35 (95%CI 0.15-0.80, p = 0.01) (Table 2).

gene panel and a combination of expression clustering,
bootstrap aggregation and Cox regression modelling, we
were able to identify a set of 4 genes, HDGF, KIAA0286,
RFC4 and MSH6 which were significantly predictive of
anthracycline benefit. Our study demonstrated that high
CIN4 score was associated with improved DRFS in
patients treated with anthracycline therapy.
There are a number of multigene signatures
associated with prognosis available commercially [21],
some of which are being tested in prospective randomized
trials such as “Microarray in Node-Negative Disease May
Avoid Chemotherapy Trial” (MINDACT) [22] and “Trial
Assigning Individualised Options for Treatment (Rx)”
(TAILORx) [23]; both studies are assessing whether it
is possible to avoid the use of chemotherapy in patients
predicted not to benefit. However, no signatures that
are specifically associated with benefit from specific
chemotherapy agents have been validated to level I
evidence as described by Simon et al [24]. At this point
it still remains largely unclear which subpopulation of
patients will benefit from adjuvant anthracycline therapy
and which patients are being treated unnecessarily.
Therefore a validated diagnostic test is urgently required
to identify which subgroup of patients should be treated
with anthracycline and which should be offered alternative
therapies. The CIN4 signature identified in this study is a
credible candidate to address this specific challenge.
Our CIN4 gene signature differs from existing
candidates in being an independent predictor of
anthracycline benefit. Interestingly, three of the four
genes in our CIN4 signature are involved in DNA repair/
DNA-binding activity. Anthracyclines are thought to
exert their actions by intercalation with DNA, generation
of free radicals and crosslinking DNA to proteins [25].
Therefore, dysregulation of genes involved in DNA repair
may plausibly lead to anthracycline sensitivity. To validate
this gene signature in an independent dataset with 80%
power at the p = 0.05 level would require only 300 patients
treated in an adjuvant anthracycline trial. In conclusion
we have demonstrated that a 4 gene signature, related to
CIN, represents an independent predictor of anthracycline
sensitivity.

DISCUSSION
Chromosome segregation is a tightly orchestrated
process and when this process goes awry CIN and
aneuploidy results [16]. The original CIN signature
produced by Carter and colleagues used aneuploidy as a
surrogate marker for CIN and both this and mRNA CIN
signatures were associated with poor prognosis in multiple
cancers [11-12]. Furthermore, a study performed by Szasz
and colleagues identified a four gene signature, AURKA,
FOXM1, TOP2A and TPX2 from the CIN70 signature
based on the high level of correlation with histological
grade and in silico expression [17]. Their four gene score
was able to stratify grade 2 breast cancer patients into
good and poor prognostics cohorts even better than Ki67
and the mitotic index [17]. CIN has also been linked to
sensitivity to specific chemotherapy agents, including
anthracyclines [10]. In this study we examined the role
of CIN gene signatures as predictive biomarkers for
anthracycline benefit in breast cancer.
In a prospectively planned molecular analysis
of two retrospective anthracycline trials univariate
analyses and an analysis including stratification by
grade, data for the CIN25 signature further supported
our hypothesis that CIN is associated with anthracycline
sensitivity in early breast cancer. However we were
unable to demonstrate statistically significant predictive
value for the predefined CIN25 and CIN70 signatures
in multivariate regression analyses, when correcting
for conventional prognostic markers and including the
previously validated CEP17 predictive biomarker [10-7].
Several studies have demonstrated correlations between
grade and chromosomal instability [10-18-19]. Moreover,
low and intermediate grade tumours have fewer structural
genomic aberrations and numerical aberrations in whole
chromosomes [18-20], perhaps reflecting a reduced
incidence of CIN. This may explain why, in our study
there appeared to be benefit from the addition of an
anthracycline in patients with high grade tumours and high
CIN25 signature but not those with grade 1 and 2 tumours.
To validate the observed effect of CIN25 as a predictor of
anthracycline sensitivity in an independent dataset with
80% power at the p = 0.05 level we would require a 2470
patients.
We also used a training and validation approach to
derive a novel, minimum 4 gene signature “CIN4” (US
patent number 62/024,729) as a predictive biomarker
for anthracycline benefit. Using genes within the CIN70

cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, methotrexate 50 mg/
m2 and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2) every 21 days, and
E-CMF (4 cycles of epirubicin 100 mg/m2 every 21 days
followed by 4 cycles of the same CMF regimen ); patient
characteristics are shown in supplementary data (Figure
1, Supplementary Table 1). The protocol was approved
by central and local ethics committees, and each patient
provided written informed consent prior to randomization.
For the current analysis, tissue blocks were retrieved and
RNA was extracted. The primary outcomes of the BR9601
study were RFS and OS, however distant relapse free
survival was also reported .

reading, counts for each RNA species were extracted and
analyzed. The nCounter CodeSet contains two types of
built-in controls: positive controls (spiked RNA at various
concentrations to assess the overall assay performance)
and negative controls (probes for background calculation).
The raw data were normalized to the standard curve
generated via the nCounter system spike-in controls
present in all reactions.

Statistics
The SPSS (v20) statistical package was used for
statistical analysis. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival
were used for analysis of distant relapse free (DRFS)
and overall survival (OS). The Cox’s proportional hazard
model was used to obtain hazard ratios for relapse or
death. When comparing outcomes between the treatment
arms within the groups of patients identified by biomarker
expression, p-values were not calculated for sub-groups
to avoid multiple testing and bias where one group was
much smaller than the other. The Cox model was instead
used to identify statistically significant interactions (p <
0.05) between biomarkers and outcome on the different
treatments (treatment by marker effect), in models that
also included biomarker status (marker effect) and
treatment, as covariates. For the CIN25 and CIN70
signatures values were dichotomised around the median
as previously described and a combined, preplanned
treatment by marker analysis was performed using results
from both the BR9601 and MA5 clinical trial cohorts.

MA.5 trial
The MA.5 trial randomized 716 premenopausal
women with node-positive breast cancer to receive
either adjuvant CEF or CMF (Figure 1, Supplementary
Table 1). The CEF regimen consisted of 6 cycles of
epirubicin 60 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 500 mg/
m2, both delivered intravenously on days 1 and 8, and oral
cyclophosphamide 75 mg/m2 daily on days 1 through 14.
Patients randomized to the CEF regimen also received
antibiotic prophylaxis throughout. The CMF regimen
consisted of 6 cycles of methotrexate 40 mg/m2 and 5-FU
600 mg/m2, both delivered intravenously on days 1 and
8, and oral cyclophosphamide 100 mg/m2 daily on days
1 through 14. The MA.5 protocol was approved by the
institutional review board at each participating center
and registered as NCI-V90-0027 on cancer.gov. Written
informed consent was obtained from each woman.

Development of a 4 gene predictive signature

RNA extraction

The combined BR9601/MA5 cohort was split to
two groups according to the randomized treatment. Using
Affinity propagation clustering (R package apcluster1),
the 70 genes were clustered into 9 groups according to
their expression profiles (Supplementary Figure 2). A
multivariate Cox model was fitted for each gene, adjusting
for clinical variables including HER2, ER, PgR, tumour
size, grade and nodal status. The top genes from each
expression cluster, with the most significant p-value in
the anthracycline treated cohort and a non-significant
CMF cohort, were selected to make a list of 21 genes
(Supplementary Figure 1). The number of genes selected
from each cluster was weighted by the size of the cluster;
as a result, more genes were selected for large clusters
compared to small clusters (Supplementary Table 4). Each
cluster had to be represented at least once even if the gene
in that cluster was not significant. The gene breakdown
for clusters 1-9 was as follows: CDC2; KIF20A; HDGF;
MDUFAB1, CDC3A; CDC6, MAD2L1, NXT1, TOPK;
FEN1, CCT5; DKC1, ECT2; KIAA0286, MCM2, RFC4,
MSH6; ch.TOG, CNAP1, TOP2A, RRM1 (Supplementary
Table 4). From this list, all possible combinations of 2,

Total RNA from FFPE tissue samples (2 x 10µM
full sections) were extracted using the RecoverAll Total
Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturers protocol and concentrations
were determined using the NanoDrop ND-1000
spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies).

Gene expression analysis
RNA (400ng) was used with the nCounter system,
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (NanoString ®
Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA). In brief, 5µl of RNA
was hybridized at 96oC overnight with the NanoString
Codeset. Probes for the analysis of test genes and controls
were synthesized by NanoString technologies, including
probes for the 70 genes of interest and 6 normalising genes
(Supplementary Table 2). All 76 genes and controls were
assayed simultaneously in multiplexed reactions. After
probe hybridizations and NanoString nCounter digital

3, 4 and 5 gene signatures were examined (210, 1330,
5985, and 20349 combinations respectively). Using
bootstrapped aggregation (bagging), each combination
was bootstrapped 100 times, with the median area
under the curve (AUC) noted as the bagged variable. In
each bootstrap, the treatment cohort was split into 60%
training and 40% test sets [26-27-28-29]. The AUC was
calculated from the test sets (R package survivalROC2)
(Supplementary Table 5). The gene signature selected
had the greatest AUC for a treatment by marker effect in
both the training and validation approaches and included
four genes, HDGF, KIAA0286, RFC4 and MSH6, termed
the CIN4 signature. A multivariate Cox regression was
fitted using the four genes, adjusting for the same clinical
variables mentioned above (Supplementary Table 6). A
CIN4 score was generated using the expression values of
the four genes, weighted by their regression coefficients.
