Abstract

Author Manuscript

MicroRNAs contribute to the pathogenesis of many forms of cancer, including the pediatric
cancer neuroblastoma, but the underlying mechanisms leading to altered miRNA expression are
often unknown. Here, a novel integrated approach for analyzing DNA methylation coupled with
miRNA and mRNA expression data sets identified 67 epigenetically regulated miRNA in
neuroblastoma. A large proportion (42%) of these miRNAs were associated with poor patient
survival when under-expressed in tumors. Moreover, we demonstrate that this panel of
epigenetically silenced miRNAs targets a large set of genes that are over-expressed in tumors from
patients with poor survival in a highly redundant manner. The genes targeted by the epigenetically
regulated miRNAs are enriched for a number of biological processes, including regulation of cell
differentiation. Functional studies involving ectopic over-expression of several of the
epigenetically silenced miRNAs had a negative impact on neuroblastoma cell viability, providing
further support to the concept that inactivation of these miRNAs is important for neuroblastoma
disease pathogenesis. One locus, miR-340, induced either differentiation or apoptosis in a cell
context dependent manner, indicating a tumor suppressive function for this miRNA. Intriguingly,
it was determined that miR-340 is up-regulated by demethylation of an upstream genomic region
that occurs during the process of neuroblastoma cell differentiation induced by all-trans retinoic
acid (ATRA). Further biological studies of miR-340 revealed that it directly represses the SOX2
transcription factor by targeting of its 3’ UTR, explaining the mechanism by which SOX2 is downregulated by ATRA. Although SOX2 contributes to the maintenance of stem cells in an

undifferentiated state, we demonstrate that miR-340 mediated down-regulation of SOX2 is not
required for ATRA induced differentiation to occur. In summary, our results exemplify the
dynamic nature of the miRNA epigenome and identify a remarkable network of miRNA/mRNA
interactions that significantly contribute to neuroblastoma disease pathogenesis.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a well established class of small RNA sequences which downregulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level through targeting regions of sequence
complementarity in mRNA 3’ UTRs (1). The dysregulation of miRNA expression
contributes to many aspects of tumor pathogenesis in virtually all forms of cancer, including
the paediatric cancer neuroblastoma (2, 3), with several miRNAs having demonstrated
oncogenic or tumor suppressor functions (4-12). Mechanisms leading to the dysregulation of
miRNAs in these tumors involves chromosomal imbalances (13, 14), along with overexpression of the MYCN transcription factor in clinically aggressive disease subtypes (9, 13,
15, 16). Here, we investigate whether DNA hypermethylation of miRNA regulatory regions
contributes towards their transcriptional silencing in neuroblastoma. The epigenetic
silencing of protein coding genes is a significant mechanism of down-regulating tumor
suppressor functions in these tumors (17-21), and a number of tumor suppressor miRNAs
are known to be regulated by DNA methylation in other forms of cancer (22-26).

Author Manuscript

In this report, we use a novel integrated analysis approach involving DNA methylation
profiling, coupled with miRNA and mRNA expression data, to identify an extensive set of
epigenetically regulated miRNAs in neuroblastoma tumors. We show how this set of
epigenetically regulated miRNAs targets a multitude of genes which are over-expressed in
tumours from patients with poor survival with extensive redundancy. Functional analysis of
ectopic over-expression of several epigenetically silenced miRNAs in neuroblastoma cell
lines further supports their tumor suppressive nature.

Author Manuscript

One of the major biological processes regulated by the genes targeted by the epigenetically
modulated miRNAs is cell differentiation. Differentiation is important in the treatment of
high stage neuroblastoma patients as they receive 13-cis retinoic acid at the end stage of
therapy to eliminate minimal residual disease, and a related compound, all-trans retinoic
acid (ATRA) induces some neuroblastoma cell lines to differentiate (27). Previously, we
showed that neuroblastoma cell lines treated with ATRA undergo genome-wide DNA
methylation alterations at the promoter regions of functionally relevant genes as a
consequence of miRNA mediated inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity (6). Here,
we demonstrate that DNA methylation changes occurring during ATRA induced
differentiation also include 5’ regulatory regions of tumor suppressor miRNAs. Specifically,
we show that down-regulation of the SOX2 during ATRA induced differentiation is

mediated by a miRNA that is up-regulated and over-expressed as a consequence of
demethylation following ATRA treatment.
Our results provide novel insight on genome-wide DNA methylation as a mechanism of
silencing an extensive network of tumor suppressor miRNAs that redundantly target genes
which are over-expressed in tumours from patients with poor survival.

RESULTS
Identifying epigenetically silenced miRNAs in primary neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines

Author Manuscript

Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was carried out on DNA samples isolated
from 18 primary neuroblastoma tumors (Supplementary Table S1) and Kelly, SK-N-AS and
SK-N-BE cells to assess the methylation status of up-stream regions of miRNAs. MeDIP
enriched DNA was hybridized to custom tiling arrays spanning 50 kb up-stream and 20 kb
down-stream of 528 miRNA loci. Integrated analysis was restricted to 298 miRNA loci for
which qPCR expression data was available. The experimental design is presented in Figure
1a.

Author Manuscript

Analysis of DNA methylation was performed within 10 kb up-stream of each pre-miRNA
based on predicted transcriptional start sites and putative promoter regions for the majority
of miRNAs (28). Statistically significant DNA methylation peaks within this region were
identified and the mean probe score within the region covered by the peaks was calculated
for every locus in each sample, allowing quantification of DNA methylation levels. Next,
we identified the DNA methylation peak mapping closest to the pre-miRNA sequence where
the levels of methylation exhibited a significant inverse correlation (Spearman’s r <-0.40, p
<0.05) with the expression level of the respective miRNA. In total, 67 miRNA were
identified with a DNA methylation peak in which the mean methylation score was
significantly inversely correlated with expression across the set of tumors (Supplementary
Table S2).

Author Manuscript

Two dimensional hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out on the tumors based on both
expression of the 67 methylation-sensitive miRNAs and the methylation levels of the peak
mapping closest to the pre-miRNA (Figure 1b). Several studies have used the presence of
histone marks or RNA polymerase II binding sites to predict the positions of miRNA
transcriptional start sites (TSS) (29-32), and it is of interest that 28 (42%) of the DNA
methylation peaks identified in our study either overlap or map within -2kb or +500 bp of a
predicted TSS (Supplementary Table S2). In eight instances miRNA forming parts of
genomic clusters had nearly identical expression patterns in the tumors, consistent with them
being regulated by the same methylated up-stream site.
A recent report has shown that the majority of DNA methylation for protein coding genes
occurs in regions known as CpG shores, which are regions within 2 kb of a CpG island
(CGI) (33). Similar to protein coding genes, the majority of methylation peaks for miRNAs
were located in CpG shores as opposed to CGI, with the frequency of methylation peaks
decreasing as distance from the CGI increased (Figure 1c).

DNA methylation status was also validated for several loci in four tumors and two cell lines
(Kelly and SK-N-BE) by EpiTYPER analysis which allowed quantitative assessment of
methylation at selected loci. There were statistically significant (p < 0.05) positive
correlations between the two data sets (Supplementary Figure S1).
Clinical relevance and functional validation of miRNAs regulated by DNA methylation

Author Manuscript

Remarkably, 42% (n = 28) of the epigenetically regulated miRNAs were significantly
associated with either lower event-free (EFS) or overall (OS) patient survival when underexpressed in 237 neuroblastoma tumors (Figure 1b; Supplementary Figure S2). This
represents a significant enrichment for prognostically relevant miRNA among those that are
epigenetically silenced. Treatment of Kelly SK-N-AS, SHSY-5Y and SK-N-BE with the
demethylating agent 5’-aza-2 deoxycytidine (5’-Aza) revealed that 30 out of the 67 miRNAs
had significantly increased expression in one or more cell lines (for both biological
replicates >1.5 fold increase; p <0.05)(Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure S3), providing
functional validation of DNA methylation as a regulatory mechanism. Among the miRNAs
that were associated with poor patient survival when under-expressed in tumors, 53%
(16/30) could be reactivated by 5’ Aza.
The impact of ectopic over-expression of three epigenetically silenced miRNAs, miR-195,
miR-196a, and miR-497 on the viability of Kelly, NB1691, SK-N-BE, or SK-N-AS
neuroblastoma cells was assessed. Cell lines transfected with these miRNAs exhibited
significantly decreased cell viability by 96 hours post-transfection (Supplementary Figure
S4), further underscoring the importance of these miRNAs as tumor suppressors.

Author Manuscript

Although the majority of the 67 epigenetically regulated miRNAs were hypermethylated and
inactivated in poor prognosis tumours, 10 were hypermethylated in favourable tumors and
over-expressed in tumours from patients with poor OS/EFS (Figure 2b and Supplementary
Figure S2).
Identification of gene targets of epigenetically regulated miRNA

Author Manuscript

In order to identify potential mRNA targets of the methylation sensitive miRNAs, a panel of
42 primary neuroblastoma tumors with both miRNA (TaqMan qPCR) and mRNA
(Affymetrix Exon array) expression data was analyzed to identify mRNAs inversely
correlated with the 67 epigenetically regulated miRNAs. In total, 1,250 mRNAs had
expression patterns that were significantly inversely correlated to at least one miRNA, and
had 3’UTRs that were significantly enriched for predicted target sites from the set of 55
miRNA (Supplementary Table S3). The number of miRNAs predicted to bind to an mRNA
was significantly positively correlated with the level of inverse expression (P <2.2e-16, r
=0.64) (Figure 2a). For the 3’ UTR of CDK6, four of the 16 predicted miRNA target sites
(miR-29b, -29c, -195 and let-7b) have been experimentally validated in other studies
(34-37).
Microarray mRNA data from an independent set of 88 tumors (http://R2.amc.nl) was then
used to determine if the genes targeted by the miRNAs had any significant correlations with
poor OS when over-expressed in tumors. Remarkably, 56% (n =35) of the top 5% of our

predicted target genes were over-expressed in tumors from patients with lower OS (Figure
2a, Supplementary Table S4). In contrast, only 14% (n = 9) of genes in the bottom 5% were
over-expressed in tumors from patients with lower OS (Supplementary Table S4),
representing a statistically significant skewing (p=8.8e-05). The relationships between genes
from the top 5% grouping (i.e., greatest number of miRNA target sites) and the
epigenetically regulated miRNAs are depicted in Figure 2b.
Gene ontology analysis carried out on the entire set of 1,250 target genes demonstrated
enrichment for a number of biological processes, including regulation of cell differentiation,
an effect that is induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment of some neuroblastoma
cell lines (Figure 2c).

ATRA treatment results in functionally significant DNA de-methylation of miRNA
regulatory regions

Author Manuscript

We previously reported that neuroblastoma cell lines exhibit a substantial de-methylation of
promoter regions for protein coding genes following ATRA treatment (6), leading us to
consider the possibility that similar epigenetic alterations might occur at promoter regions of
miRNAs. MeDIP microarray analysis, along with miRNA expression analysis was carried
out on ATRA treated and untreated SK-N-BE cells. Twenty miRNAs had up-stream regions
(<10 kb from the pre-miRNA) which were de-methylated and up-regulated >1.5 fold
(p<0.05) following ATRA treatment. Twenty-four miRNAs were hypermethylated and
down-regulated >1.5 fold post-ATRA treatment. Analysis of miRNA expression in an
independent cell line (SHSY-5Y) following ATRA treatment indicated that four of the demethylated miRNAs and nine of the hypermethylated were over or under-expressed
following 7 days of ATRA exposure, respectively, indicating that some of the methylation
changes are a consistent feature of differentiation. None of the hypermethylated miRNAs
were correlated with patient EFS or OS, and among the de-methylated miRNAs, only
miR-340 was significantly re-expressed in both cell lines following ATRA treatment (Figure
3a). This miRNA was also significantly associated with poor OS and EFS when underexpressed in 237 primary NB tumors (Figure 3b, c). There were four distinct methylation
peaks (Figure 3d) within 10 kb up-stream of miR-340, with all peaks having varying levels
of de-methylation in response to ATRA treatment. miR-340 was identified as an
epigenetically regulated miRNA in primary tumors (Figure 1b) and was significantly upregulated after 5’-Aza treatment in both SK-N-BE and SHSY-5Y (Figure 1b and
Supplementary Figure S3).
Functional effects of miR-340 over-expression

Author Manuscript

Given that miR-340 is functionally inactivated by DNA methylation in neuroblastoma,
mature miR-340 mimics or a negative control were transfected into SK-N-BE, SHSY-5Y
and Kelly cells to elucidate the biological effects. Following transfection, over-expression of
miR-340 was validated by qPCR (Supplementary Figure S5). miR-340 over-expression
resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability for each cell line (Figure 4a), and also
significantly impeded colony forming ability (Figure 4b).

miR-340 was up-regulated in SK-N-BE and SHSY-5Y following ATRA treatment, but not
in Kelly. It is intriguing that the phenotypic response of Kelly cells to ATRA is apoptosis
(38), while both SK-N-BE and SHSY-5Y are well known to undergo neural differentiation.
We therefore decided to test the hypothesis that ectopic over-expression of miR-340 has
different phenotypic consequences in these cell lines. As illustrated in Supplementary Figure
S6a, miR-340 over-expression in Kelly resulted in the cells becoming rounded and detached.
A significant increase in apoptosis was confirmed by FACS analysis of P.I./annexin V
stained cells (Supplementary Figure S6b,c). In contrast, SK-N-BE cells at 7 days post
miR-340 transfection had increased neurite extensions (Supplementary Figure S7a) and
miR-340 transfection yielded no change in the number of apoptotic cells relative to the
negative control (Supplementary Figure S7b,c). PI staining followed by FACS analysis of
SK-N-BE cells transfected with miR-340 or negative control sequences revealed an
accumulation of cells in S-phase and a significant decrease in the G2-phase of the cell cycle
(p=0.03) at 96-hours post-transfection (Figure 4c), indicating a block during S-phase. The
expression of three markers of differentiation (SOX2, PAX6 and TUBB3) at 7 days post
miR-340 transfection of SK-N-BE and SHSY-5Y cells was also assessed. Consistent with
ATRA induced differentiation, both SOX2 and PAX6 had significantly decreased mRNA
levels in the transfected cells at 7 days post miR-340 transfection (Supplementary Figure
S8a,b). However, there was no change in the levels of TUBB3 at this time point in either cell
lines (Supplementary Figure S8c). Interestingly, SOX2 over-expression in the n = 88 tumor
set is significant for poor OS and EFS with one probe (Supplementary Figure S8d,e),
consistent with findings at protein level (39).
miR-340 directly targets the 3’-UTR of SOX2 transcription factor

Author Manuscript

As described in the preceding section, SOX2 mRNA was down-regulated at 7 days post
miR-340 transfection (Supplementary Figure S8a). SOX2 was also determined to be
significantly down-regulated at 3 days post miR-340 transfection at mRNA (Figure 5a) and
protein level (Figure 5c). The down-regulation of SOX2 in ATRA treated cells (Figure 5b)
is inversely correlated with the up-regulation of miR-340 (Figure 3a). As a potential
explanation for this inverse relationship, we determined that the 3’-UTR of SOX2 contained
three predicted miR-340 binding sites (TargetScan) (Figure 5d).

Author Manuscript

To validate miR-340 targeting of SOX2, we cloned the complete 1.1 kb 3’ UTR of SOX2
into a luciferase reporter vector, psi-CHECK2. Co-transfection of miR-340 mimics and psiCHECK2-SOX2-3’UTR significantly reduced luciferase activity, and mutation of all three
miR-340 binding sites abrogated the negative effect of miR-340 on luciferase activity
(Figure 5e). The mutation of individual binding sites did not abrogate the effects of miR-340
on luciferase expression, and two of the three double mutant constructs failed to diminish
luciferase activity. However, the mutation of binding sites 2192 and 2137, with binding site
1910 remaining active, abolished the effect of miR-340 on luciferase activity, similar to the
triple deletion mutant, indicating that the 1910 binding site has no functional effect. We
conclude that miR-340 directly targets two binding sites in the SOX2 3’ UTR.
In order to confirm if the up-regulation of miR-340 is responsible for the down-regulation of
SOX2 in response to ATRA, a locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense-miR-340 sequence was

transfected into SK-N-BE cells 24 hours prior to ATRA treatment, resulting in a substantial
reduction in miR-340 (Supplementary Figure S9a) and an increase in SOX2 protein levels
within 96 hours post-ATRA treatment (Supplementary Figure S9b). SK-N-BE cells with
increased SOX2 levels had extensive neurite outgrowth within 5 days after ATRA treatment
(Supplementary Figure S9c) and exhibited a decrease in cell growth that was comparable to
negative controls (Supplementary Figure S9d). We conclude that up-regulation of miR-340
is responsible for reducing SOX2 levels during ATRA induced differentiation of SK-N-BE
cells, but that the maintenance of SOX2 protein levels is insufficient to block differentiation
from occurring.

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript

This study is the first attempt to investigate DNA methylation as a possible mechanism for
the dysregulation of miRNA expression in neuroblastoma. Our integrated analysis of DNA
methylation with miRNA and mRNA expression data sets permitted the identification of a
large set of epigenetically regulated miRNAs with significantly enriched target sites in the 3’
UTRs of genes over-expressed in unfavourable tumor subtypes. This integrated approach
identified miRNAs which have never been associated with DNA methylation (n = 41), along
with 26 miRNAs that were previously validated as epigenetically regulated in other forms of
cancer, as summarized in review articles (24, 26). Overall, 22% (67/298) of the miRNAs
examined in our study were sensitive to the effects of DNA methylation. Dudziec et al.
demonstrated that hypermethylation of miRNAs in bladder cancer is more frequent in CpG
shores than CpG islands (40), and our results in neuroblastoma are consistent with this
finding.

Author Manuscript

Our results establish that multiple epigenetically regulated miRNAs often target the same
mRNA at a higher than expected frequency, indicating significant targeting redundancy.
mRNAs that are targeted by multiple miRNAs exhibited more pronounced inverse
expressional correlations with the targeting miRNAs, thus confirming this relationship at a
functional level. This is consistent with experimental findings that targeting of mRNAs by
more than one miRNA can have an additive or even a synergistic impact on reducing mRNA
levels (41, 42). It should be noted that a microarray based approach will not detect miRNA/
mRNA interactions that result in translational inhibition without mRNA degradation.
However, some groups have reported that miRNA/mRNA interactions that result in mRNA
degradation have a greater negative impact on protein levels than do interactions resulting
only in translational inhibition (43, 44).

Author Manuscript

Remarkably, a high proportion of both the methylated miRNAs (42%) and their associated
mRNA targets (56% of the highly redundantly targeted mRNAs) are highly associated with
poor clinical outcome when under and over-expressed in tumors, respectively. Thus, a
relatively high proportion of epigenetically inactivated miRNAs and their mRNA targets
show promise as prognostic candidate clinical markers. Prior functional studies have
indicated that several of the hypemethylated miRNAs, including miR-let-7, 10a, -10b, -101,
-184, -335, and -542-5p negatively impact neuroblastoma cell viability or migration, both in
vitro and in vivo (4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 45, 46). As demonstrated in this report, epigenetically
silenced miR-340, -195, -196a, and -497 negatively impact neuroblastoma cell viability

when ectopically over-expressed in cell lines. Many of the genes targeted by the
epigenetically regulated miRNA panel have known oncogenic functions in either
neuroblastoma or other forms of cancer. For example, AKT2 is predicted to be targeted by 9
epigenetically regulated miRNAs and the importance of AKT2 expression for neuroblastoma
cell survival has been previously demonstrated (5, 8, 11). LIN28B, a well established
oncogene that promotes cell transformation (47, 48), is a predicted target of 9 epigenetically
regulated miRNAs. CDK6 over-expression is important in many cancers and had 16
predicted target sites from the miRNAs.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The direct targeting of SOX2 by miR-340 has been demonstrated in this report. SRY box
containing (SOX) transcription factor family members act sequentially in regulating the
maintenance and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. Bergsland et al (49) demonstrated
that both SOX2 and SOX3 pre-bind many genes in embryonic stem cells and neural
progenitor cells, which can only be activated by binding of SOX11 at a later developmental
stage. In response to ATRA, SOX2 levels decrease while SOX3 and SOX11 levels increase
(49, 50). Here, we demonstrate that the decrease in SOX2 expression is mediated by
miR-340 targeting. Although SOX2 is vital to maintaining normal stem cells and cancer
stem cells in an undifferentiated state (50, 51), and can restore stem cell properties when cotransfected with other transcription factors into a variety of mature cell types (52), we
demonstrate that a decrease in SOX2 levels is not sufficient to deter ATRA induced
differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. This is not surprising given the very large number of
miRNAs and genes whose transcript levels are altered in response to ATRA. In contrast,
Jankowski et al demonstrated that SOX11 expression is required for neurite outgrowth and
survival of murine Neuro2a following ATRA treatment (49). siRNA inhibition of these cells
in the absence of ATRA also increased apoptotic cell death. This is consistent with our
finding that SOX11 is over-expressed in unfavourable tumour subtypes, and provides a
rationale for why 13 miRNAs targeting this mRNA sequence are inactivated by DNA
methylation.
miR-340 regulates a very large number of target mRNA sequences, so it seems likely that
the impact of ectopic-over expression of miR-340 on neuroblastoma cell differentiation and
apoptosis is not mediated solely through SOX2 targeting. The pleiotropic effects of miR-340
is supported by the fact that over-expression causes SK-N-BE and SHSY-5Y cells to
differentiate, and Kelly cells to undergo apoptosis. miR340 also has an impact on breast
cancer cell migration and invasion through targeting the MET oncogene, indicating that it is
a tumor suppressor of broad importance in multiple forms of cancer (53).

Author Manuscript

In summary, our findings support extensive epigenetic silencing of miRNAs that target a
large repertoire of genes that are over-expressed in unfavourable neuroblastoma tumours
with substantial redundancy. Our study also underscores the significance of cross talk
between these miRNAs and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in the process of
neuroblastoma cell differentiation.

methanol and stained with crystal violet.
Cell Cycle and apoptosis analysis
Cells were harvested 96 hrs post-transfection with the miRNA mimics or negative control
and subsequently fixed using 70% ethanol. The fixed cells were stained using PI/triton
X-100/RNase solution and the cells were FACS sorted using the BD LSR-II Analyzer
(Becton, Dickinson and Company, NJ, USA). Cell cycle analysis was performed using the
FlowJo tool (http://www.flowjo.com/index.php). Apoptosis was measured using ANNEXIN
V staining (8).
Cloning of 3’-UTR of SOX2 and luciferase assays

Author Manuscript

A 1.1 kb DNA fragment containing the entire SOX2 3’UTR was PCR amplified from
genomic DNA using flanking primers (Supplementary Table S6), cloned into the pCR4TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), and subsequently sub-cloned into
psiCHECK2 vector (Promega) to generate psi-SOX2-3’UTR. The resultant clone was
sequenced verified (GeneBank Accession No:JQ231229) and used to create the deletion
mutants for miR-340 binding sites using the GeneTailor mutagenesis system (Invitrogen).
Luciferase assays were performed as previously reported (8).

Integration of miRNA expression and methylation data

Author Manuscript

Discrete genomic regions prone to methylation (having a peak in at least one sample) were
selected. The mean probe score across these regions was used to indicate the methylation
level at that location in each sample. This enabled the study to focus on all regions that
undergo methylation in neuroblastoma as opposed to solely GpG Islands. 67 miRNAs with
expression significantly inversely correlated (Spearman) to peaks ≤10kb up-stream were
selected. Two-way hierarchical clustering was performed using the integrated (additive)
methylation and expression similarity matrix (see Supplementary Figure S8). In the heatmap
high expression and low methylation of a miRNA is coloured red (vice versa green); a
conflict where both are high or low is coloured black.
Target prediction of methylation sensitive miRNAs

Author Manuscript

An integrated matrix was compiled of 56 miRNAs (56/67 expressed in ≥10 samples) and all
mRNAs that had significant inverse correlation (over 42 matched tumor samples) and a
predicted 3’UTR binding site (TargetScan v5.1). mRNAs with significant overrepresentation of predicted target sites (Chi-square) were retained (thus nullifying biases
such as 3’UTR length). The bipartite network graph in Figure 2b was generated using Java
software package jgraphx v1.8.5.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Experimental miRNA data presented are based on mean replicate values and error bars
indicate either standard deviation or the standard error of mean. Statistical tests used
include: two-tailed, unpaired T-test, Spearman’s Rank correlation and Pearson’s correlation.
Statistics, clustering, heatmap and scatter plots were generated by R statistical programming
language v2.13.0. Kaplan Meier plots were generated using the median or quartile split and
the log rank test using the R2 database (http://R2.amc.nl/).

Figure 1. Identification of methylation sensitive miRNA

Author Manuscript

(a) Flowchart representing study design. (b) Integrated heatmap and two-dimensional
hierarchical clustering for 67 methylation sensitive miRNAs. Tumors are clustered
horizontally while miRNA are clustered vertically. Characteristics of the tumors are
displayed at the top of the heat map. The heat map is based on both levels of miRNA
expression and levels of DNA methylation at each locus, with a key to the color coding
presented in the upper left corner. The colored vertical bar on the left designates miRNAs
from the same cluster which display similarity in expression levels due to being under the
control of a common upstream site of methylation. The table on the right designates
miRNAs that are associated with poor OS/EFS when under-expressed in tumours (black, n =
28) or over-expressed in tumors (grey, n = 10). miRNAs that are up-regulated in response to
the demethylating agent, 5-aza-cytidine, in four different cell lines are designated in the
table. (c) The distribution of all methylation peaks within 10kb of CpG Islands. The majority
of peaks occur within regions defined as CpG shores.
