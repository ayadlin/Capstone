Abstract
VEGF-C and VEGF-D were identiﬁed as lymphangiogenic growth factors and later shown to promote
tumor metastasis, but their effects on carcinogenesis are poorly understood. Here, we have studied the effects
of VEGF-C and VEGF-D on tumor development in the murine multistep chemical carcinogenesis model of
squamous cell carcinoma by using a soluble VEGF-C/VEGF-D inhibitor. After topical treatment with a tumor
initiator and repeated tumor promoter applications, transgenic mice expressing a soluble VEGF-C/VEGF-D
receptor (sVEGFR-3) in the skin developed signiﬁcantly fewer squamous cell tumors with a delayed onset
when compared with wild-type mice or mice expressing sVEGFR-3 lacking the ligand-binding site. Epidermal
proliferation was reduced in the carcinogen-treated transgenic skin, whereas epidermal keratinocyte
proliferation in vitro was not affected by VEGF-C or VEGF-D, indicating indirect effects of sVEGFR-3
expression. Importantly, transgenic mouse skin was less sensitive to tumor promoter–induced inﬂammation,
with reduced angiogenesis and blood vessel leakage. Cutaneous leukocytes, especially macrophages, were
reduced in transgenic skin without major changes in macrophage polarization or blood monocyte numbers.
Several macrophage-associated cytokines were also reduced in transgenic papillomas, although the dermal
macrophages themselves did not express VEGFR-3. These ﬁndings indicate that VEGF-C/VEGF-D are
involved in shaping the inﬂammatory tumor microenvironment that regulates early tumor progression.
Our results support the use of VEGF-C/VEGF-D–blocking agents not only to inhibit metastatic progression,
but also during the early stages of tumor growth. Cancer Res; 73(14); 4212–21. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common
human cancer. The basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) subtypes constitute the majority of NMSCs.
High-risk populations for the development of NMSC can be
identiﬁed and may beneﬁt from preventive strategies.
Although angiogenesis is required for the progression of
solid tumors beyond a critical size, the role of lymphatic vessels
in primary tumor growth has not been studied in detail. VEGFC and VEGF-D activate VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) signaling
that is critical for the growth of lymphatic vessels, a process
known as lymphangiogenesis (1, 2). Besides constitutive
expression on lymphatic vessels, VEGFR-3 is also expressed
in angiogenic blood vessel sprouts (3). Thus, VEGFR-3 signaling may also modulate the growth of blood vessels (angiogenAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; and 2Translational Cancer Biology Program, Biomedicum Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland

esis). Indeed, inhibition of ligand-induced VEGFR-3 signaling
was found to reduce angiogenesis in some tumor types, with a
stronger effect when combined with VEGFR-2 inhibition (4). In
its proteolytically processed form, the VEGFR-3 ligand VEGF-C
can also activate VEGFR-2, although less potently than the
strongly angiogenic VEGF-A. In contrast, the mouse VEGF-D
does not activate VEGFR-2 (5).
In a previous study, high VEGF-C expression in SCC led to
enhanced tumor lymphangiogenesis and metastasis but did
not affect tumor incidence; possible effects on tumor growth
rate were not studied (6). In contrast, antibody-mediated
VEGFR-3 blockage was reported to decrease the growth rate
of several transplanted carcinomas (7, 8). For tumor growth, a
permissive tissue microenvironment is required. Inﬂammation
and angiogenic factors derived from tissue inﬁltrating inﬂammatory cells act to promote tumor growth (9). Tumor-associated macrophages may polarize toward antitumor immune
responses or protumor functions such as the production of
VEGF-A. A role for VEGFR-3 activation in promoting the
recruitment of proangiogenic tissue macrophages was previously suggested in a subcutaneously growing mouse melanoma model (10, 11).
In this study, we investigated the effects of the expression of
a soluble form of VEGFR-3 (sVEGFR-3) on the development of
chemically induced squamous cell tumors in mouse skin.
SVEGFR-3, consisting of domains 1 to 3 of human VEGFR-3
fused to the Fc-part of human IgG, was expressed under the

Blocking VEGF-C and VEGF-D Inhibits Skin Carcinogenesis

keratin 14 (K14) promoter in the skin of transgenic mice (12).
These transgenic mice lack cutaneous lymphatic vessels but a
normal blood vasculature has been previously described in
these mice (12). We used a two-step chemical carcinogenesis
model of SCC (13) to study the effects of VEGFR-3 ligand
blockage on early tumor initiation and growth. As in this model
tumors develop after 10 weeks of treatment, long-term VEGF-C
and VEGF-D blockade was implemented through constitutive
transgenic expression of sVEGFR-3.
Surprisingly, we found that squamous tumor development
was signiﬁcantly reduced in sVEGFR-3 transgenic mice. Several aspects of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the
levels of pro-inﬂammatory mediators, were also found altered
by the blockage of VEGF-C/VEGF-D. By studying early tumor
growth, we found that although VEGFR-3 expression was
restricted to lymphatic vessels, VEGFR-3 ligand inhibition
reduced tumor incidence via diverse effects on angiogenesis,
blood vascular leakage, and the inﬂammatory tissue microenvironment. Together, these ﬁndings indicate a potential of
VEGFR-3 inhibition in cancer chemoprevention and therapy.

Materials and Methods
Transgenic mice
All mouse experiments were approved by the Veterin€
aramt of
the Kanton Zurich. K14-VEGFR-3 domain 1 to 3—Fc transgenic
mice [FvB-TgN(K14-VEGFR-3d1-3-Fc)] express a sVEGFR-3 in
the basal epidermal keratinocytes of the skin (12). K14-VEGFR-3
domain 4 to 7—Fc transgenic [FvB-TgN(K14-VEGFR-3d4-7-Fc),
referred to here as "control transgenic"] mice were generated
similarly. Hemizygous transgenic but not control transgenic
mice show a phenotype of mild edema of the legs (paws), tail,
and snout.
Chemical carcinogenesis
An established multistep chemical carcinogenesis protocol
was followed to induce SCCs of the skin (13). Female wild-type
FvB-strain mice were shaved on their back skin in isoﬂurane
anesthesia at 8 weeks of age. Two days later, mutations in DNA
were induced by topical application of 50 mg of the tumor
initiator 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) in acetone
(200 mL) on the back skin of mice anesthetized with ketamine–
medetomidine. Subsequently, 5 mg of the promoter 12-Otetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in 200 mL acetone was
applied once per week on the back skin of mice anesthetized
with ketamine–medetomidine. The mice were shaved under
isoﬂurane anesthesia 2 days before TPA treatment. In a ﬁrst
long-term study, tumor growth and malignant transformation
were observed in 35 transgenic and 35 wild-type mice. Tumors
were scored weekly in a blinded manner and mice were
sacriﬁced by overdose of anesthetic 6 weeks after SCC development. Skin samples from the carcinogen treatment area
(back) and untreated control area (abdomen), papillomas,
carcinomas, and serum were collected. Short-term DMBA-TPA
treatment (DMBA followed by 5, 14, or 15 weekly TPA treatments) was used to study tumor initiation, inﬂammation, and
early tumor growth. Blood vascular leakage was imaged noninvasively (as described later) 24 to 30 hours after 3 or 14 TPA
treatments. The mice were sacriﬁced overdose of anesthetics

www.aacrjournals.org

48 to 52 hours after the last TPA treatment and the treated back
skin was collected. For gene expression analyses, macrophages
were isolated by ﬂuorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) from
the treated back skin (as described in Supplementary Methods)
24 hours after the ﬁfth TPA treatment. TPA-treated back skin
was also collected 6 hours after 14 weekly TPA treatments for
analysis of TNF-a levels. To further investigate vascular leakage, inﬂammation was induced in ear skin by application of 0.5
mg TPA (in 20 mL acetone) weekly on one ear under ketamine–
medetomidine anesthesia. The other ear was left as an untreated control. VEGFR-3, CD68, CD11b, MECA32, and podoplanin
were immunostained in ears collected 48 hours after single
TPA treatment and in untreated ears.
Immunoﬂuorescence staining of tissue sections
Tissue cryosections were blocked using immunomix (5%
nonimmune donkey serum, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA),
and 0.05% NaN3 in PBS with 0.3% Triton X) or antibody diluent
(Zytomed). Primary antibodies and analyses are described in
Supplementary Methods. AlexaFluor conjugated secondary
antibodies (Invitrogen) and Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) nuclear stain were used.
Measurement of blood vascular leakage
Vascular leakage was quantiﬁed by dynamic imaging using
an IVIS Sprectrum (Caliper Life Sciences) after a tail vein
injection of a pegylated near-infrared dye to anesthetized mice
(14). A detailed description of the method is given in the
Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analyses
A two-tailed Student t test was used for comparisons of
continuous variables between two groups. For comparisons
between three groups, one-way ANOVA with Tukey or Dunnett
posttest was used. For comparison of tumor incidences, the
two-tailed Fisher exact test was used.

Results
Reduced tumor development in sVEGFR-3 transgenic
mice
A previously described chemical carcinogenesis protocol
was used to generate tumors in wild-type and in K14VEGFR-3 transgenic mice (13). Serum concentrations of the
sVEGFR-3 protein were 17  11 ng/mL in untreated transgenic
mice, whereas a strong upregulation was found after 21 weeks
of DMBA-TPA treatment (309  60 ng/mL; Supplementary Fig.
S1A), due to activation of the K14 promoter in the hyperplastic
epidermis. The untreated dermis of transgenic mice was
signiﬁcantly thicker than that of wild-type littermates (406
 25 mm vs. 270  36 mm, respectively, P ¼ 0.006), whereas no
major differences in epidermal thickness were found (Fig. 1A).
In contrast, the epidermis of transgenic mice was signiﬁcantly
thinner than that of wild-type mice after 21 weeks of the
DMBA-TPA treatment (19  2.5 mm vs. 26  4.7 mm, respectively, P ¼ 0.04; Fig. 1A).
Tumor growth was scored weekly, and over 1-mm-diameter
tumors were counted. Morphologically heterogeneous, aggressive, and inﬁltrative tumors over 5 mm in diameter were scored

as SCC. Surprisingly, tumor incidence, that is the proportion of
mice bearing at least one tumor, was signiﬁcantly smaller in
the transgenic mice and they developed signiﬁcantly fewer
papillomas per mouse when compared with the wild-type mice
(Fig. 1B–D). The growth rates of established tumors did not
differ signiﬁcantly between the wild-type and transgenic mice
and the malignant conversion rate was unaffected (Fig. 1E;
Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C). To investigate the possibility
that the smaller tumor incidence in transgenic mice was
caused by the Fc-part of the sVEGFR-3 fusion protein, we
generated another transgenic mouse line (called control transgenic from here on). These mice express a sVEGFR-3 protein
where the VEGF-C/VEGF-D binding domains 1 to 3 have been
replaced by domains 4 to 7 that are not involved in ligand
binding. Control transgenic mice showed no apparent phenotype, their cutaneous lymphatic vasculature seemed normal in
immunoﬂuorescence stainings (data not shown), and SCC
growth was similar to that of wild-type mice (Fig. 1F).
Because of the delayed incidence and reduced tumor growth
in the transgenic mice expressing the VEGF-C and VEGF-D
inhibitor, we next investigated whether VEGF-C or VEGF-D
exerts direct effects on the survival and proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes. EGF stimulated the proliferation of
cultured keratinocytes, whereas VEGF-C, VEGF-D, or BSA did
not have any signiﬁcant effects (Supplementary Fig. S1D). We
thus considered it unlikely that the blockage of VEGF-C and

4214

VEGF-D by sVEGFR-3 would directly inhibit tumor cell proliferation in transgenic mice.
Attenuated angiogenesis in DMBA-TPA–treated skin
and tumors of K14-VEGFR-3 transgenic mice
Previous studies have shown that the chemical carcinogenesis treatment activates angiogenesis in the skin (6, 15). To
study the effects of sVEGFR-3 on angiogenesis, blood vessel
areas were quantiﬁed by immunoﬂuorescence staining for the
endothelial markers MECA32 and CD31. Compared with wildtype mice, the blood vessel area was slightly smaller in the back
skin and in tumors of transgenic mice (Fig. 2A). After DMBA
and 14 weekly TPA applications, the blood vessel density in the
skin of transgenic mice was signiﬁcantly lower than in the
treated skin of wild-type mice (Fig. 2B). In tumor-bearing mice
(21 weeks of treatment, followed by an average period of 10
weeks), the blood vessel density was also lower in the TPAtreated skin of transgenic mice than in wild-type mice,
although the differences did not reach statistical signiﬁcance
(Fig. 2C). The intratumoral blood vessel density was variable
due to the highly heterogeneous morphology typical of squamous cell tumors. The trend toward smaller vessel density in
papillomas and SCCs of transgenic mice was statistically
signiﬁcant when the data for papillomas and carcinomas were
combined (transgenic 2.5  1.7 vs. wild-type 4.3  2.4 area
percentage, P ¼ 0.01; Fig. 2C).

Blocking VEGF-C and VEGF-D Inhibits Skin Carcinogenesis

Blood vessel permeability is increased under inﬂammatory
conditions and in tumors. Dynamic assessments of vascular
leakage were made using a pegylated near-infrared dye
injected intravenously. We ﬁrst measured vascular leakage
in untreated and TPA-treated ears for easy comparison of
anatomically identical areas of the skin, thus providing a
better identiﬁcation of changes caused by the treatment.
Signiﬁcantly less leakage of the tracer was found in the
untreated ears of transgenic mice than in wild-type mice
(P ¼ 0.0063; Fig. 3B). After three weekly TPA treatments,
strongly increased leakage rates were detected in the ears of
wild-type mice (P ¼ 0.0003; Fig. 3B). In contrast, the leakage of
the tracer was signiﬁcantly lower in treated transgenic mice
(P < 0.0001). Lower leakage rates were also observed in the
back skin of transgenic mice when compared with wild-type
mice (P ¼ 0.0002 and 0.0058 after 3 and 14 TPA treatments,
respectively).

Less DMBA-TPA–induced skin inﬂammation in
K14-VEGFR-3 transgenic mice
A striking difference was observed in the degree of cutaneous inﬂammation between transgenic and wild-type mice
at 4 weeks of DMBA-TPA treatment (Fig. 3A). The wild-type
mice displayed pronounced scaling and redness of the shaved
skin, whereas transgenic mice showed only little redness and
a few hairless patches. We therefore next analyzed blood
vascular leakage, leukocyte recruitment, and inﬂammatory
cytokines in the treated skin of transgenic and wild-type
mice.

Reduced macrophage recruitment in the skin of
K14-VEGFR-3 transgenic mice
Cutaneous inﬂammation involves recruitment of inﬂammatory cells to the skin. Markedly, fewer CD45þ leukocytes were
observed in the untreated and DMBA-TPA treated skin of
transgenic mice when compared with wild-type mice (P ¼
0.006 and 0.06, respectively; Fig. 4A and B). Leukocyte densities
in papillomas of transgenic mice were also somewhat less than
in papillomas of wild-type mice whereas no major differences
were found in SCCs.
To further characterize the leukocyte inﬁltrates, the skin
and tumor sections were stained using the leukocyte markers
CD11b (monocytes, granulocytes, macrophages, and mast
cells), F4/80 (M2 macrophages, eosinophils), and CD68
(macrophages). CD11bþ leukocytes were signiﬁcantly less
abundant in untreated abdominal skin and treated back skin
(both P < 0.05) of transgenic mice than in wild-type mice (Fig.
5A and B). The CD11b leukocyte counts were decreased in
transgenic papillomas and carcinomas when compared with
DMBA-TPA–treated transgenic skin; however such trend was
not found in wild-type mice. Thus, the density of CD11bþ
cells was signiﬁcantly lower in the SCCs of transgenic mice
than of wild-type mice (P ¼ 0.04; Fig. 5B). The F4/80þ cells
could not be reliably counted as individual cells, but the
tissue area % stained for F4/80 was smaller in untreated
abdominal skin and treated back skin of transgenic mice (P ¼
0.054 and 0.0019, respectively; Fig. 5C). In the dermis, high
CD68 expression is restricted to macrophages whereas dendritic cells express lower levels of this marker (16). Staining
untreated and treated skin for CD68 conﬁrmed that there
were fewer macrophages in transgenic skin (P ¼ 0.0012 and
0.0078, respectively; Fig. 5D).
There were fewer CD68þ cells in the DMBA-TPA–treated
back skin (6 weeks of treatment) of transgenic mice than in
control transgenic mice or wild-type mice (P < 0.05; Fig. 5E).
Therefore, the low cutaneous CD68þ cell counts in the
transgenic mice were speciﬁcally associated with the blockage of VEGF-C and VEGF-D. Accordingly, lower levels of
TNF-a, an important proinﬂammatory cytokine secreted by
macrophages, were detected in the DMBA-TPA–treated skin

of transgenic mice than in wild-type or control transgenic
mice (P < 0.01; Fig. 5F). The relative blood leukocyte or
monocyte counts in wild-type and transgenic mice did not
differ signiﬁcantly (P ¼ 0.11 and 0.63, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S2).
We next quantiﬁed T-cell populations in DMBA-TPA–treated skin because a deﬁciency of CD4þ helper T cells has
previously been reported to attenuate tumor development in
human papilloma virus gene 16 transgenic mice, whereas a
deﬁciency of CD8þ cytotoxic cells had less inﬂuence on tumor development, possibly delaying tumor growth (17). Signiﬁcantly fewer CD4þ and CD8þ cells were found in the DMBATPA–treated transgenic skin compared with similarly treated
wild-type and control transgenic skin (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Fig. S3). These results were conﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometric
analysis of the cells (Fig. 6B).
Macrophage M1/M2 polarization is not altered by the
K14-VEGFR-3 transgene
The tumor microenvironment has profound effects on the
"polarization" of tumor-associated macrophages to antitumor
(M1 or classically activated) or protumor (M2 or alternatively activated) effector cells. M1 macrophages secrete the antiangiogenic interleukins (IL)-12 and IL-23, kill microorganisms
and tumor cells, and present antigens, efﬁciently activating
antitumor immunity, whereas M2 macrophages potentiate
tissue remodeling, secrete VEGF-A and MMP-9 and thereby
activate angiogenesis and facilitate tumor metastasis (18). We
analyzed cutaneous cytokine levels to characterize the polarization of the immune system and angiogenic signaling in
the tumor microenvironment of DMBA-TPA–treated skin and
tumors. Several macrophage-associated cytokines were selected on the basis of preliminary screening using cytokine arrays
and many of these cytokines were found at lower levels in the
papillomas of transgenic mice (Supplementary Table S1).
Lower levels were also observed for MCP-1 (CCL2), MIP-1a,
and IL-16. To address possible differences in the pro- or

4216

Cancer Res; 73(14) July 15, 2013

antitumor polarization of the tumor microenvironment,
VEGF-A, IL-12 (p40), IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 were quantiﬁed in
the skin of mice treated for 14 weeks. No major differences
were found except for the antiangiogenic M1 cytokine IL-12
that was detected at higher levels in the transgenic than wildtype skin.
Next, macrophage polarization was analyzed by cell surface marker expression on CD45þ, CD11bþ cells, and in RNA
isolated from CD45þ, CD11bþ, F4/80þ positive cells obtained
from the back skin of mice treated with DMBA-TPA for 5
weeks (Supplementary Fig. S4). The percentage of macrophages expressing the M2 surface markers Tie2 and CD206
was similar in transgenic and wild-type skin. However, macrophages from transgenic skin expressed lower levels of the M2
"angiogenic" macrophage marker Tie2 (Supplementary Fig.
S4A and S4B). No signiﬁcant differences were observed in the
levels of Vegf, Lyve-1, Tnfa, Il-10, or Tie2 mRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Thus, we conclude that the polarization of
cutaneous macrophages does not differ between transgenic
and wild-type mice.
Hypothetically, the decreased macrophage density in the
skin of transgenic mice could be explained by blockage of
possible chemotactic effects of VEGF-C and/or VEGF-D on
VEGFR-3 expressing macrophages (10, 11). However, in double
staining for the macrophage markers CD11b and CD68 with
VEGFR-3, no VEGFR-3 expression was observed in cutaneous
macrophages in untreated or DMBA-TPA–treated skin or SCCs
(Fig. 7; Supplementary Fig. S5). Furthermore, Vegfr3 mRNA
levels were below the detection limit in isolated skin-derived
macrophages (data not shown). VEGFR-3 expression was not
observed in blood vessels 48 hours after a single TPA treatment
but VEGFR-3 was expressed in cutaneous blood vessels after
long-term DMBA-TPA and on some peritumoral blood vessels
(Supplementary Fig. S5).
The expression of the VEGF coreceptors neuropilins (Nrp)
was analyzed next. Expression of Nrp-2 was observed in
vascular endothelium and in the epidermis (Supplementary

in the dermis, and in the tumor interstitium. CD68-expressing
cutaneous macrophages did not express Nrp-1 or Nrp-2 in
untreated or DMBA-TPA–treated skin or tumors.

Discussion
In this study, we show that transgenic VEGFR-3 ligand
blockage decreases the development and growth of cutaneous
papillomas and SCCs in a mouse chemical carcinogenesis
model. Importantly, VEGF-C or VEGF-D did not exert direct
effects on the proliferation of isolated epidermal cells. This is in
line with previous results showing that high expression of
VEGF-C in the epidermis of transgenic mice did not promote
skin carcinogenesis (6). However, VEGF-C and VEGF-D blockage inﬂuenced the vascular and inﬂammatory tissue microenvironment that is required for efﬁcient tumor development,
pinpointing to novel effects of VEGF-C and/or VEGF-D on
critical components of the tumor microenvironment in the
chemically induced SCC model.
We found that the density of blood vessels was reduced in
the skin and in tumors of transgenic mice in which VEGF-C
and VEGF-D were blocked. This is consistent with the
ﬁnding that VEGFR-3 may provide angiogenic signals when
expressed in blood vessel endothelium (4, 19). Activation of
angiogenesis facilitates tumor growth by provision of oxygen
and nutrients, whereas activation of lymphangiogenesis
facilitates tumor dissemination (1). Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis are induced in human cutaneous SCCs (20,
21). This is accompanied by increased expression of genes
associated with lymphangiogenesis, such as VEGF-C, Nrp-2,
and VEGFR-3, in peritumoral skin (20). However, in contrast

www.aacrjournals.org

to blood vessels, lymphatic vessels are not known to directly
affect primary tumor growth. The observed blood vascular
effects of sVEGFR-3 may be explained by inhibition of VEGFC–induced VEGFR-2 activation, and VEGFR-2/VEGFR-3
heterodimers in blood vascular endothelium (22). Blood
vascular VEGFR-3 expression was detected in long-term
DMBA-TPA–treated skin and in tumors but not in untreated
skin or TPA-promoted skin. Therefore, the observed reduction of angiogenesis in the skin of the transgenic mice may
be mediated mainly through inhibition of VEGF-C/VEGFR-2
interactions, in particular as mouse VEGF-D does not bind
to mouse VEGFR-2 (5).
VEGFR-3 ligand blockage also potently reduced inﬂammation, which is thought to be mediated mainly by VEGFR-3–
independent angiogenic signaling via VEGF-A produced by
macrophages. Although blood vascular VEGFR-3 expression
was not observed in the untreated skin, the transgenic mice
showed reduced blood vascular leakage that was increased
after the DMBA-TPA treatment. Indeed, high expression levels
of VEGF-C may increase blood vascular permeability, most
likely via VEGFR-2 signaling (23, 24). Importantly, however, the
lack of lymphatic vessels increases interstitial pressure in
transgenic mice (25), which can counteract blood vascular
leakage. This is likely to restrict the extravasation of inﬂammatory mediators reducing, for example invasion of inﬂammatory cells, and other tumor-promoting molecules such as
ﬁbrinogen (26).
Under physiological conditions, lymphatic vessels transport
ﬂuid, soluble factors, and cells to the lymph nodes. Antigen
presenting cells (APC, such as activated dendritic cells from the
skin) travel through the lymphatic vessels to the draining

lymph nodes, where they induce acquired immune responses.
In addition, soluble antigens drained to the lymph nodes by the
lymphatic vessels are taken up by lymph node–resident B cells
and APCs for mounting of an acquired immune response. A
chronic immune response may establish a protumorigenic
tissue microenvironment and augment squamous tumor
growth in the skin.
In the multistep chemical carcinogenesis SCC model used
here, tumor growth is initiated by topical application of DMBA
and promoted by weekly topical application of TPA, which
induces epigenetic changes, inﬂammation, and hyperprolifera-

tion of basal keratinocytes (27). Simultaneously, the transcription of TNF-a is upregulated (28) and activates the classical
signs of inﬂammation, including redness (blood vessel dilatation) and swelling (increased blood vascular permeability),
resulting in continuous recruitment of inﬂammatory cells to
the treated skin (27). After only three applications of TPA, the
skin of transgenic mice seemed less inﬂamed than the skin of
similarly treated wild-type mice. This led us to investigate
potential changes in cutaneous inﬂammation following
VEGFR-3 ligand blockage, as a possible reason for reduced
tumor development and growth in the transgenic mice. Indeed,

in transgenic mice with VEGFR-3 ligand blockage, the densities
of macrophages and T cells were reduced in untreated and
DMBA-TPA–treated skin. This may be due to decreased antigen delivery to the skin draining lymph nodes in the sVEGFR-3
transgenic mice that have defective cutaneous lymphatic
vessels. Because previous studies have shown that mice deﬁcient of CD4þ T cells have a decreased incidence of SCC (17),
this suggests that the decreased inﬂammation, including fewer
CD4þ T cells, decreased the tumor growth promotion.
Because monocytes chemoattracted to tumor tissue produce angiogenic factors, monocyte and macrophage densities
were studied in more detail. In contrast to the short-lived, socalled inﬂammatory monocytes, resident monocytes may give

rise to the Tie2-expressing monocyte subset, which can potently promote tumor growth by secretion of angiogenic factors
(29). The M2-activated subpopulation of tumor-associated
macrophages may also express Tie2 (30). Despite a modest
reduction of cell surface expression of Tie2 on transgenic
macrophages and high IL-12 expression in DMBA-TPA–treated skin, no major differences were observed in the polarization of macrophages of wild-type and transgenic skin after the
DMBA-TPA treatment. Thus, the mere reduction of macrophage density seen in the transgenic skin may account for the
reduced tumor numbers.
Direct effects of VEGFR-3 ligand blockage are unlikely to
explain for the reduced density of macrophages in the skin

of the transgenic mice, because VEGFR-3 was not expressed
by macrophages in untreated or DMBA-TPA–treated skin.
VEGFR-3 expression in macrophages may depend on the
tissue because expression was previously reported on
macrophages in subcutaneously growing melanoma xenotransplants (10). Macrophage inﬂammatory protein 1a
(MIP-1a) and MCP-1 (CCL2), important macrophage chemoattractants, were among the several macrophage-associated cytokines found at lower levels in the transgenic skin
and in transgenic papillomas. The DMBA-TPA–induced
inﬂammatory response includes elevated expression of
MIP-1a (31), whereas MCP-1 is expressed by lymphatic
endothelial cells (32). Thus, the lack of lymphatic vessels
likely contributed to the reduced MCP-1 levels and reduced
macrophage numbers in transgenic skin.
In contrast to the chemical carcinogenesis model used in
this study, previously published studies on the blockage of
VEGFR-3 signaling in cancer have used local injections of
millions of tumor cells (7, 8, 33–36). This is quite different
from the situation in human cancer. In particular, in tumor
transplantation models, premalignant progression is circumvented by the selection and ampliﬁcation of malignant cells in
culture already before they are in contact with the tissue
microenvironment. In contrast, in more than 20% of human
cancers, inﬂammation may act as a critical promoter of tumor
growth and progression (37). In the chemical carcinogenesis
model, tumor growth requires a permissive tissue microenvironment, which is simulated by inﬂammation, induced by TPA.
These features of the chemical carcinogenesis model allow the
analysis of possible effects on early tumor growth in a cutaneous tissue microenvironment similar to the early development of NMSC in humans. To block VEGF-C and VEGF-D
during more than 10 weeks of the chemical carcinogenesis
treatment, we ﬁrst tested viral gene delivery, but this failed to
yield high sVEGFR-3 levels in the skin. We thus decided to use
the constitutive K14/sVEGFR-3 transgenic model in which the
sVEGFR-3 levels are upregulated by the carcinogenesis treatment, because of the increased expression of keratin14 by the

hyperplastic epidermal keratinocytes. It would be of interest
to investigate, in future studies, an inducible sVEGFR-3 transgene to restrict expression of the inhibitor to the carcinogenesis treatment period.
Because of the advantages of the chemical carcinogenesis model, we were able to show novel pleiotropic effects of
VEGF-C and VEGF-D blockage in the tumor tissue microenvironment. Our new observations on inhibition of angiogenesis, blood vascular leakage, and the protumorigenic
inﬂammatory tissue microenvironment support the use of
VEGFR-3 ligand blockage not only to target tumor metastasis but also at early stages of tumor growth.
