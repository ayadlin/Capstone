Abstract
Approximately 30% of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC)
harbor molecular alterations in PI3K/mTOR signaling, but
therapeutic inhibition of this pathway has not been effective.
We hypothesized that intrinsic resistance to TORC1/2 inhibition is driven by cancer stem cell (CSC)-like populations that
could be targeted to enhance the antitumor action of these
drugs. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by
which PI3K/mTOR inhibitors affect the stem-like properties of
TNBC cells. Treatment of established TNBC cell lines with a
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor or a TORC1/2 inhibitor increased the
expression of CSC markers and mammosphere formation. A
CSC-speciﬁc PCR array revealed that inhibition of TORC1/2

increased FGF1 and Notch1 expression. Notch1 activity was
also induced in TNBC cells treated with TORC1/2 inhibitors
and associated with increased mitochondrial metabolism and
FGFR1 signaling. Notably, genetic and pharmacologic blockade
of Notch1 abrogated the increase in CSC markers, mammosphere formation, and in vivo tumor-initiating capacity induced
by TORC1/2 inhibition. These results suggest that targeting the
FGFR–mitochondrial metabolism–Notch1 axis prevents resistance to TORC1/2 inhibitors by eradicating drug-resistant CSCs
in TNBC, and may thus represent an attractive therapeutic
strategy to improve drug responsiveness and efﬁcacy. Cancer

Introduction

lates S6K and 4EBP1, signal transducers involved in RNA translation and protein synthesis, while TORC2 phosphorylates and
activates Akt, a major effector of PI3K signaling (8). Inhibitors of
PI3K/mTOR, TORC1/2 and TORC1, are currently being developed in breast cancer patients (9). Preclinical studies using
patient-derived and cell line–generated TNBC xenografts suggest
an antitumor effect of PI3K/mTOR (4) and mTOR inhibitors (10).
However, clinical efﬁcacy of these drugs in patients with TNBC has
been limited.
Recent publications have implicated various mechanisms of
resistance to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, such as BEZ235. These
mechanisms included activation of JAK2/STAT5, STAT3, and
eiF4E in various tumor models (11, 12). The PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 binds to the kinase domain of mTOR, thus potently
inhibiting both TORC1 and TORC2 complexes in addition to
PI3K (13, 14). Cancer stem cells (CSC) are a subpopulation of
drug-resistant cells with self-renewing and tumor-initiating capacities (15, 16). Based on these concepts, we ﬁrst identiﬁed that
resistance to BEZ235 was driven more by TORC1/2 inhibition
than PI3K inhibition and, second, we asked whether this resistance was due to the survival of a CSC-like population. We
hypothesized that TORC1/2 inhibition promotes the survival of
CSCs and, therefore, targeting molecular pathways utilized by
these CSCs should enhance the antitumor effect of these inhibitors against TNBC cells. We show herein that TORC1/2 inhibition
results in activation of Notch 1, which, in turn, increases CSCs.
Further, we show that Notch1 activation is dependent on FGFR1
and mitochondrial activity. These results point to an intrinsic
limitation of TORC1/2 inhibitors in TNBC but also suggest that
combinations of TORC1/2 inhibitors with antagonists of the
FGFR–mitochondrial metabolism–Notch1 axis are worthy of
clinical investigation in appropriately selected tumors.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for approximately 15% of all breast cancers and is considered the most
virulent clinical subtype of this neoplasm. Most of these tumors
exhibit a basal-like gene expression signature (1). Patients with
metastatic TNBC respond transiently to chemotherapy but almost
invariably progress and exhibit a poor prognosis (2). Currently
there are no approved targeted therapies in TNBC, underscoring
the need to identify pathogenic pathways in this breast cancer
subtype. Genomic and proteomic studies have identiﬁed PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathway alterations in the basal-like subtype of breast
cancer, of which, approximately 80% are TNBC (3–6). However,
therapeutic blockade of this pathway with single-agent inhibitors
has not been effective.

Targeting TORC1/2 and Notch1 Abrogates Tumor Initiation

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
All cell lines were obtained from the ATCC and cultured
according to the instructions provided by ATCC for no longer
than 6 months. Cell lines were tested and authenticated by short
tandem repeat (STR) proﬁling by the ATCC. The human Notch1
intracellular domain (hNICD) construct was a gift from Linzhao
Cheng , Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore,
MD (Addgene plasmid #17626; ref. 17). RBP-Jk ﬁreﬂy luciferase
lentiviral particles were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The 4X-CSL
luciferase plasmid was a kind gift from Raphael Kopan, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO (Addgene
plasmid #41726; ref. 18). BEZ235, MLN128, RAD001 (everolimus), and GSI-IX were obtained from SelleckChem. Lucitanib
was provided by Clovis Oncology. Paclitaxel and oligomycin A
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The Hes1 ﬁreﬂy luciferase
plasmid was a kind gift from Scott Hiebert (Vanderbilt University,
Nashville, TN).
Viability assays
Cells were seeded in 96-well black plates and treated with
inhibitors or siRNAs. At variable time points, 10 mL of Alamar
Blue reagent was added to each well. Plates were incubated at
37 C for 4 hours in the dark. After 4 hours, the plates were read in a
GloMax Multi Detection plate reader.
Flow cytometry of stem cell markers
The ALDEFLUOR assay (Stemcell Technologies) was performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines to identify
cells with high ALDH activity. Cells were passed through a 35-mm
ﬁlter, suspended in Aldeﬂuor assay buffer þ BODIPY-aminoacetaldehyde (BAAA) and incubated for 45 minutes at 37 C in the
presence or absence of the ALDH inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB). CD44-APC (BD Biosciences), PROCR-PE (BD
Biosciences), ESA-FITC (BD Biosciences), CD24-PE (BD Biosciences), and CD133-APC (Biolegend) antibodies were incubated
with single cells in PBS/1% FbS for 30 minutes at 4 C. Cells were
stained with propidium iodide (PI) or 7-AAD to exclude nonviable cells. For experiments using cells transfected with GFP-tagged
hNICD, CD44-APC was used to detect the CSCs. GFP analysis by
FACS analysis was used to verify transfection of the hNICD
construct. The CSC markers representing tumor-initiating populations in the cell lines used and their respective references are
given in Table 1.
Mammosphere assay
Single-cell suspensions were seeded in 6-well ultra-low attachment plates (Corning) in serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 20
ng/mL EGF (R&D Systems) and 1 B27 (Life Technologies). Fresh
mammosphere media were added every 3 days. Mammosphere
number and volume were determined using the GelCount mamTable 1. CSC markers that represent tumor-initiating populations in the cell lines

malian cell colony counter (Oxford Optronix). For microscopic
images of mammospheres the original magniﬁcation of the
images is  40 (4  10). For generation of secondary mammospheres, primary mammospheres were enzymatically (0.05%
Trypsin) and mechanically digested by pipette tituration, imaged
to assess dissociated single cells, counted and re-seeded in
mammosphere media.
Immunoblot analysis
Cell monolayers were washed and then lysed with RIPA lysis
buffer (150 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mmol/L NaF, 120 mmol/L
NaCl, 100 mmol/L sodium vanadate, and 1 protease inhibitor
cocktail; Roche). Lysates (40 mg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes; these were ﬁrst incubated with primary antibodies at 4 C overnight or at room temperature for 2 hours followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated
anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) for 1 hour at room temperature. Immunoreactive
bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo
Scientiﬁc). All antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology
with the exception of FGFR1, which was obtained from Abcam.
RNA interference
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates or 10-cm dishes. The following day, cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides
mixed with Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Life Technologies). Notch1,
TFAM, JAG1, Rictor, and Raptor siRNA oligonucleotides were
obtained from Dharmacon. FRS2 and FGFR1 siRNA was obtained
from Ambion.
Dye exclusion assay
Cells were grown in monolayer up to 70% to 80% conﬂuence,
treated with 10 mmol/L Cell Tracker Green dye (Life Technologies), and incubated in serum-free media for 30 minutes at 37 C,
after which media were replaced with regular growth media for
additional 45 minutes. Cells were then trypsinized and seeded at
20% conﬂuence. Cells were analyzed by FACS on days 1 and 10
for FITC expression.
Quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was harvested using the RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen) and used to
synthesize cDNA (iSCRIPT cDNA synthesis kit, Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR reactions were performed using SYBR Green Master Mix (Bio-Rad) and the Bio-Rad
IQ5 cycler. Relative mRNA levels were standardized to GAPDH
mRNA levels. The Stem Cell, Cancer Stem Cell, and Mitochondrial
Metabolism PCR Arrays (SA Biosciences), containing primers for
84 pathway-speciﬁc genes each, were performed according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression was veriﬁed in cells
independently using primers from SA Biosciences.
Nanostring analysis
RNA was extracted from formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded
blocks of tumor biopsies obtained from patients before and after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Nanostring Analysis was performed
as previously described (19).
Luciferase reporter assays
Cells were transiently transfected for 5 hours with the RBP-Jk,
4X-CSL or Hes1 ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter (SA Biosciences), each

with a CMV Renilla luciferase reporter. Media were changed
and cells were treated with BEZ235 or MLN128 for 17 to 48
hours. Cells were lysed and the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay
(Promega) was performed according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Luciferase readings were determined using the GloMax Multidetection System (Promega), and the ratio of ﬁreﬂy
luciferase to Renilla luciferase was calculated.
Transmission electron microscopy
SUM159 cells were treated with vehicle, 250 nmol/L BEZ235,
or 100 nmol/L MLN128 for 48 hours, processed for transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and imaged in the Vanderbilt Cell
Imaging Shared Resource-Research Electron Microscopy facility.
Embedding. Samples were ﬁxed in 2.5% gluteraldehyde in 0.1
mol/L cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 at room temperature for 1 hour
and then transferred to 4 C overnight. Samples were next washed
in 0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer and incubated for 1 hour in 1%
osmium tetraoxide at room temperature, followed by another
wash with 0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer. Subsequently, the samples
were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series and three
exchanges with 100% ethanol, followed by two exchanges with
pure propylene oxide (PO). Samples were then serially inﬁltrated
with 25% Epon 812 resin and 75% PO (1:3) for 30 minutes at
room temperature, with 50% Epon 812 resin and 50% PO (1:1)
for 1 hour at room temperature, and then inﬁltrated once more
with 50% Epon 812 resin and 50% PO (1:1) overnight at room
temperature. The samples were subsequently inﬁltrated with
100% Epon 812 resin for 48 hours and then allowed to polymerize at 60 C for an additional 48 hours.
Sectioning and Imaging. Thick sections (500 nm to 1 mm) of the
embedded samples were collected using a Leica Ultracut microtome. Sections were contrast stained with 1% toluidine blue and
imaged with a Nikon AZ100 microscope. Ultra-thin sections (70–
80 nm) were cut and collected on 300-mesh copper grids and
post-stained with 2% uranyl acetate and then with Reynold's lead
citrate. Samples were imaged on the Philips/FEI Tecnai T12
electron microscope at various magniﬁcations.
In vivo studies
All animal experiments and procedures were done in accordance with a protocol approved by the Vanderbilt University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Athymic female
mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley) were inoculated with 5  106
SUM159 or 8  106 MDA468 cells mixed with Matrigel (1:1) in
the #4 mammary gland. Ten days (for SUM159) or 3 weeks (for
MDA468) later, mice bearing tumors measuring 75 mm3 were
randomized to treatment with vehicle, MLN128 (1 mg/kg 3 times
weekly p.o.), GSI-IX (10 mg/kg, 3 days on, 4 days off, i.p), or both
drugs. Tumor diameters were serially measured with calipers and

mouse weight determined 2 times weekly. Tumor volume in mm3
was calculated by the formula: volume ¼ length/2  width2.
Xenograft dissociation
Xenografts were collected and tumor fragments either ﬂash
frozen in liquid N2 or ﬁxed in 10% formalin followed by embedding in parafﬁn. In some cases, xenografts were harvested and
rinsed in PBS, mechanically minced with sterile blades in DMEM/
F12/5% FBS and antibiotics/antimycotics in C-tubes (Miltenyi
Biotech), and then incubated with 1 Collagenase/Hyaluronidase þ 0.2 mg/mL DNAseI for 30 minutes at 37 C. Dissociated
cells were passed through 70- and 35-mm ﬁlters and separated
from debris using a Ficoll-Paque gradient. Cell viability was
veriﬁed by trypan blue exclusion before inoculation into
tumor-free nude mice.
Statistical analysis
Statistical differences were determined using the Student t test.
For the NanoString analysis of RNA from paired tumor biopsies,
paired t tests were utilized. For animal studies, the differences
between treatment groups were determined by the Mann–Whitney test with Bonferroni post hoc corrections. For the in vivo
limiting dilution assay, extreme limiting dilution assay (ELDA)
analysis was performed, and the difference between groups was
recorded as described previously (20). A P value of <0.05 was
considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
TNBC cell lines display CSC properties following inhibition of
TORC1/2
Treatment of SUM159, BT549, and MDA231 TNBC cells with
each the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 and the TORC1/2
inhibitor MLN128 decreased growth and expression of activated mTOR substrates S6 ribosomal protein and 4EBP-1 (Fig. 1A
and B). Following a 3-day treatment with BEZ235 and MLN128
but not with the TORC1 inhibitor RAD001, surviving SUM159,
BT549, and MDA231 cells were enriched for the following CSC
markers as determined by FACS: ALDHþ, CD44hi/PROCRþ,
and PROCRþ/ESAþ, respectively (Fig. 1C). These are established markers of tumor-initiating populations in these cell
lines (Table 1). Consistent with the induced changes in CSC
markers, cells surviving BEZ235 and MLN128 treatment exhibited increased mammosphere formation (Fig. 1D). Treatment
with the pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 did not increase CSC
markers in SUM159 and BT549 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
This result coupled with the effects induced by BEZ235 and
MLN128 suggested that TORC1/2 inhibition but not PI3K
inhibition was causally associated with CSC induction. Another
feature of CSCs and tumor-initiating cells is increased nuclear
dye/label retention (21, 22). Using a dye retention assay, we
observed that 40% and 20% of cells treated 10 days with

Persistent TORC1/2 inhibition drives Notch1 signaling and a CSC-like phenotype. A, SUM159 and B, BT549 cells were treated with progressively higher concentrations
(50–300 nmol/L) of BEZ235 (BEZR) and MLN128 (MLNR) over a period of 8 weeks. FACS analysis for the CSC markers was quantiﬁed (SUM159:  , P ¼ 0.0002;

treatment are shown (magniﬁcation, 40). E, immunoblot analysis of SUM159 and BT549 BEZR and MLNR cells was performed using the indicated
antibodies. F, SUM159, BEZR, and MLNR cells were transfected with the HES1-Fireﬂy Luciferase and CMV-Renilla constructs. The Dual Luciferase Assay was
performed after 48 hours as described in Materials and Methods ( , P < 0.0001;   , P ¼ 0.03). G, SUM159 CTL, BEZR, and MLNR cells were cultured in the
continuous presence of vehicle or their respective inhibitor or taken off drug selection for 72 hours, followed by immunoblot analysis for NICD, C-MYC, and
JAG1. Error bars, mean  SEM.

BEZ235 and MLN128, respectively, retained the Cell Tracker
dye compared with <5% of untreated cells (Supplementary Fig.
S1B). These results suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of
TORC1/2 in TNBC cells results in the survival of a cell population with CSC-like features.
Inhibition of TORC1/2 increases Notch1 signaling
In order to identify genes associated with CSCs surviving
TORC1/2 inhibition, we used a Cancer Stem Cell–speciﬁc PCR
array. SUM159 cells were treated with MLN128 for 48 hours and
assessed for changes in CSC gene expression. Notch1, Jagged1
(JAG1), POUF51 (OCT4), MUC1, and MYC expression was
increased >2-fold upon MLN128 treatment, with Notch1 being
the top hit with a near 4-fold induction (Fig. 2A). Supporting the
array data, treatment of six TNBC cell lines with each BEZ235 and
MLN128 for 72 hours induced Notch1 mRNA levels anywhere

www.aacrjournals.org

from 2- to >20-fold as measured by qPCR (Fig. 2B). Using a
separate Stem Cell–speciﬁc PCR array to conﬁrm these ﬁndings,
both Notch1 and JAG1 were induced >1.5-fold upon BEZ235
treatment of SUM159 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In the Stem
Cell PCR array, a 10-fold increase in FGF1 mRNA was observed,
which was conﬁrmed in SUM159 and BT549 cells treated with
each BEZ235 and MLN128 for 3 to 48 hours (Supplementary Fig.
S2B and S2C). A similar induction of FGF1 mRNA was seen in
MLN128-treated CAL51, CAL120, and MDA468 but not in
MDA231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D and S2E). Concurrent
with the induction of Notch1 mRNA, BEZ235 and MLN128
treatment increased expression of the active Notch1 intracellular
domain (NICD). Drug-induced NICD expression was ablated by
the g-secretase inhibitor GSI-IX, which prevents the cleavage of
full-length Notch1 (Fig. 2C). In addition, protein expression of
the Notch ligand JAG1 was increased in BEZ235- and MLN128-

treated TNBC cells (Fig. 2D). Drug-induced Notch1 activation was
associated with increased expression of the classical Notch target
genes HES1 and HEY2 (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, BT549, MDA468,
and SUM159 cells transfected with a NICD-responsive transcriptional reporter displayed increased reporter activity upon 17- to
48-hour treatment with BEZ235 and MLN128 (Supplementary
Fig. S2F and S2G). MLN128-induced treatment was time dependent, being detected at 24 hours and increasing up to 72 hours
(Fig. 2F). To genetically replicate TORC1/2 inhibition, we downmodulated Rictor (TORC2) and Raptor (TORC1) expression with
siRNA. Dual knockdown of Rictor and Raptor augmented NICD
expression and the ALDHþ population in SUM159 cells; these
were not observed with Rictor or Raptor siRNA alone (Fig. 2G).
These data suggest that TORC1/2 inhibition induces expression of
CSC genes Notch1 and Jag1, the stem cell gene FGF1, and activates
Notch signaling.
Next, we investigated whether chronic inhibition of TORC1/2
also induces a CSC phenotype and Notch1 activity. SUM159 and
BT549 cells were maintained in gradually increasing concentrations (50–300 nmol/L) of BEZ235 and MLN128 for a period of 2
months. BEZ235- and MLN128-resistant (BEZR and MLNR)
SUM159 and BT549 cells displayed increased CSC markers (Fig.
3A and B) and mammosphere-forming capacity compared with
untreated control cells (Fig. 3C and D). This was associated with
increased expression of NICD, JAG1, and the Notch1 transcriptional target c-MYC (Fig. 3E), and HES1 luciferase reporter activity
(Fig. 3F) in BEZR and MLNR cells compared with their respective
untreated controls. BEZR and MLNR cells withdrawn from their
respective inhibitor for 72 hours continued to exhibit higher levels
of NICD, JAG1, and c-MYC (Fig. 3G). These results suggest that,
similar to acute treatment, chronic inhibition of TORC1/2 in
TNBC cells sustains a surviving population of CSCs with activated
Notch.
Finally, we examined whether a similar enrichment of Notchactivated CSCs occurred with other anticancer therapies. Other
studies with TNBC cells have suggested that cells resistant to
chemotherapy exhibit cancer stem-like features (19, 23). RNA
extracted from 17 matched primary breast tumor biopsies before
and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was subjected to Nanostring
analysis. Notch1 and JAG1 mRNA expression was signiﬁcantly
higher in post-chemotherapy, drug-resistant tumors (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Paclitaxel is one of the most commonly used
chemotherapeutics in TNBC. Consistent with the primary breast
tumor data, paclitaxel treatment of SUM159 cells increased NICD
expression (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The combination of paclitaxel with each BEZ235 and MLN128 inhibited SUM159 growth
more potently than each drug alone (Supplementary Fig. S3C).

However, the cells surviving the combination displayed increased
ALDH positivity and mammosphere formation (Supplementary
Fig. S3D and S3E). The combination of paclitaxel and MLN128
induced an increase in NICD expression in SUM159 cells, which
was abrogated with a g-secretase inhibitor (Supplementary Fig.
S3F). These data also suggest that TORC1/2 inhibitors and anticancer chemotherapeutics result in a resistant Notch1-driven CSC
population.
Blockade of Notch1 decreases the CSC population induced by
TORC1/2 inhibition
To establish a causal association between Notch1 activity and
the CSCs induced by TORC1/2 inhibition, we blocked Notch1
both genetically and pharmacologically. Knockdown of Notch1
using two siRNAs decreased BEZ235 and MLN128-induced CSCs
in both SUM159 and BT549 lines as determined by FACS (Fig. 4A
and B). Notch1 downmodulation also decreased the ALDHþ
population in SUM159 MLNR cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A)
and abrogated MLN128-induced NICD expression in SUM159
cells (Fig. 4C). In both SUM159 and BT549 cells, Notch1 knockdown with two siRNAs completely blunted MLN128-induced
mammosphere formation (Fig. 4D and E). Furthermore,
siRNA-mediated downmodulation of the Notch1 ligand JAG1
decreased MLN128-induced NICD expression and mammosphere formation (Supplementary Fig. S4B). These results suggest
that genetic targeting of Notch1 and its ligand JAG1 abrogate the
surviving CSC population following TORC1/2 inhibition.
To pharmacologically block Notch, we employed the g-secretase inhibitor GSI-IX (GSI). Using FACS, treatment with GSI-IX
markedly decreased SUM159 and BT549 CSCs induced by acute
MLN128 treatment (Fig. 4F and Supplementary Fig. S4C) as well
as SUM159 MLNR CSCs induced by chronic MLN128 treatment
(Fig. 4G). To examine the effect of Notch inhibition in vivo, nude
mice were injected with SUM159 cells in the #4 mammary gland.
Once tumors reached 75 mm3, mice were randomized to
treatment with (i) vehicle, (ii) MLN128, (iii) GSI, or (iv) MLN128
þ GSI. After 28 days, MLN128 treatment reduced tumor growth
by 60% compared with vehicle-treated tumors; the combination
of MLN128 and GSI did not enhance the anti-tumor effect of
MLN128 alone (Fig. 4H). Immunoblot analysis of MLN128treated tumor lysates displayed increased NICD and JAG1 expression, which were undetectable in tumors treated with MLN128
and GSI (Fig. 4I). Next, we performed a limiting dilution assay to
assess the tumorigenic capacity of cancer cells in the treated
xenografts. Tumors from all four treatment groups were harvested
after 28 days; single cells were prepared and injected in limiting
dilutions (50–5,000) into tumor-free mice. SUM159 cells from

MLN128-treated xenografts displayed a >4-fold greater tumorigenic potential in vivo compared with cells from vehicle-treated
xenografts (P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 4J). This increase in CSC frequency was
markedly reduced in cells from tumors that had been treated with
MLN128 þ GSI (P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 4J). A similar experiment was
performed with MDA468 cells. MLN128 treatment decreased
growth of MDA468 xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S4D) but
enriched for a tumorigenic CSC population in residual drugresistant tumors. This population was markedly reduced in
MLN128þGSI-treated tumors (P ¼ 0.00001; Supplementary Fig.
S4E). These results suggest TORC1/2 inhibition enriches a
Notch1-dependent tumor-initiating population
Notch1 activity induced upon TORC1/2 is dependent on
mitochondrial metabolism
To explore mechanisms by which TORC1/2 inhibitors enrich a
Notch1-dependent CSC population, we examined metabolic
alterations associated with the induction of Notch1 activity and
CSCs. A link with cellular metabolisms is suggested by a recent
study in pancreatic cancer showed that cells surviving MEK
inhibition or KRAS depletion displayed increased mitochondrial
metabolism and tumorigenic potential (24). SUM159 and BT549
cells treated with MLN128 expressed increased levels of the
mitochondrial stain Mitotracker Red, which is used as readout
of mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 5A). To determine
whether the increased Mitotracker Red staining was due to
increased mitochondrial biogenesis, we performed TEM of
MLN128-treated SUM159 cells. In MLN128-treated cells, we
observed increased mitochondrial number and increased microlipophagy (lipid droplet fusions; Supplementary Fig. S5A). Similar results were obtained with BEZ235-treated cells (data not
shown). In addition to increased mitochondrial mass, BEZ235
and MLN128 treatment increased the expression of the mitochondrial DNA transcription factor, Transcription factor A mitochondrial (TFAM; Fig. 5B). To extend on this induction of TFAM,
we performed a Mitochondrial Metabolism PCR Array using
SUM159 and BT549 cells. Polycistronic mitochondrial transcripts
from both the H1 and H2 promoter sites of the Heavy (H) strand
of the mitochondrial genome were increased >2-fold after 3 and
48 hours of MLN128 treatment compared with vehicle-treated
cells (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Fig. S5B and S5C). TFAM has been
shown to be critical for the production of transcripts from the
mitochondrial H strand promoter (25). ATP synthase complex
subunits are critical for utilizing the mitochondrial membrane
potential alteration during oxidative phosphorylation to generate
ATP (26). Expression of the ATP synthase complex subunits
(ATP5G2 and ATP5J2) were also upregulated >2-fold in both
MLN128-treated SUM159 and BT549 cells (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Fig. S5B and S5C).
To determine if the induction of TFAM and oxidative phosphorylation played a role on CSC induction, we combined
MLN128 with two different TFAM siRNAs or with Oligomycin
A (ATP synthase inhibitor). TFAM siRNA and Oligomycin A
decreased the ALDHþ population and NICD induced by MLN128
(Fig. 5D and E). TFAM siRNA also enhanced the inhibition of
SUM159 cell viability induced by each BEZ235 and MLN128
compared with each drug alone (Supplementary Fig. S5D). To
further support that the inhibition of mitochondrial activity and
of oxidative phosphorylation blocked the induction of CSCs
upon treatment with the TORC1/2 inhibitor by trumping Notch
activation, we rescued Notch1 activity with a GFP-expressing

448 Cancer Res; 76(2) January 15, 2016

human NICD vector (Fig. 5F). In SUM159 cells cotreated with
MLN128 and Oligomycin A, transfection of GFP-hNICD restored
the induction of CD44hi expression and mammosphere formation (Fig. 5G). Next, we treated BT549 cells with MLN128 and
TFAM siRNA in the presence or absence of a control vector or
hNICD. TFAM knockdown decreased MLN128-induced CD44hi
cells, but transfection of hNICD restored the CD44hi fraction
(Supplementary Fig. S5E). These results suggest that TORC1/2
inhibition augments mitochondrial biogenesis, transcription,
and metabolism, which are important for CSC survival and
Notch1 activity.
MLN128-mediated Notch1 activity is dependent on FGFR
signaling
With the link between mitochondrial metabolism and Notch
activity, we next inquired whether induction of the stem cell gene
FGF1 (Supplementary Fig. S2) participated in the interaction of
these pathways. In a panel of ﬁve TNBC cell lines, acute treatment
with MLN128 increased levels of full-length and/or the cleaved
form of FGFR1 (Fig. 6A). FGFR2, 3, and 4 were undetectable by
immunoblot analysis, with the exception of CAL51 (FGFR2,
FGFR3). However, MLN128 did not alter FGFR2 and FGFR3
expression in CAL51 cells (data not shown). We next determined
whether FGFR1 expression was necessary for MLN128-induced
NICD expression and mitochondrial activity. FGFR1 siRNA
decreased NICD and TFAM induction in both MLN128-treated
SUM159 and BT549 cells (Fig. 6B). Further, MLN128-treated
SUM159 cells displayed increased Mitotracker Red expression,
which was signiﬁcantly decreased by FGFR1 siRNA (Fig. 6C).
Menadione, which decreases mitochondrial potential, was used
as a positive control for Mitotracker expression. FGFR1 siRNA also
reduced the MLN128-induced CD44hi BT549 cell population;
this effect of MLN128 was restored by exogenous expression of
hNICD (Fig. 6D). To assess whether FGFR activation was also
involved, we used the FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
lucitanib (27, 28) and siRNA targeted against the FGFR adaptor
protein FRS2. FRS2 knockdown by RNAi was conﬁrmed by qPCR
(Fig. 6F). In both SUM159 and BT549 cells, MLN128-induced
NICD expression was abrogated by both FRS2 siRNA and by
lucitanib treatment (Fig. 6E). Similar results were observed with
MDA468 cells treated with MLN128 and lucitanib (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Additionally, FRS2 siRNA decreased MLN128induced TFAM expression (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Lucitanib
treatment also abrogated MLN128-induced ALDHþ SUM159
cells and CD44hi/CD24lo MDA468 cells (Fig. 6G). These observations suggest that FGFR activity plays a causal role in mediating
mitochondrial and Notch1 activity as well as the induction of
CSCs upon TORC1/2 inhibition (Fig. 6H).

Discussion
In this study, we observed that TORC1/2 inhibition resulted in
decreased survival/growth of TNBC cancer cells both in vitro and in
vivo but spared a population with CSC-like properties and
enhanced Notch1 activity. Both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of Notch1 blunted the CSCs induced upon inhibition of
TORC1/2. This CSC-like population that survives TORC1/2 inhibition is driven by a FGFR1–TFAM–Notch1 signaling axis. Activation of Notch1 was not limited to TNBC as inhibition of
TORC1/2 in head and neck cancer and ovarian cancer cells also
resulted in activation of Notch1 (data not shown). From a clinical

Targeting TORC1/2 and Notch1 Abrogates Tumor Initiation

perspective, these ﬁndings underscore a limitation of TORC1/2
inhibitors in cancer because of their ability to induce a signaling
nexus that drives the survival of cells with stem-like and tumorinitiating properties. TORC1 inhibition with rapamycin increases
the lifespan of mice by increasing the self-renewal and hematopoiesis of hematopoietic stem cells (29). Chronic rapamycin
treatment, which by disrupting the raptor/mTOR complex also
inhibits TORC2 (30), has been shown to increase animal lifespan
by enhancing stem cell survival (31). These observations combined with our ﬁndings suggest that TORC1/2 inhibition results
in sustenance of a stem cell-like population. This is also important
because the pathways used to prevent aging can be exploited as
molecular targets, which, once inhibited, would also limit expansion of a CSC population.
In this study, we provide evidence that TORC1/2 inhibition
promotes the survival of cells with increased mitochondrial mass
and metabolism, which are required for the maintenance of CSCs.
A report in pancreatic cancer illustrated that KRAS loss results in
the survival of cells with increased mitochondrial metabolism
(24). Additionally, the KRAS-deﬁcient surviving cells were tumorigenic and sensitive to inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation.
Another study showed that conditional loss of TFAM in keratinocytes decreased two Notch1 transcriptional targets Hes1 and
Hey2 (32). Therefore, a tumorigenic population of cells can utilize
a mitochondrial-dependent Notch1 axis to survive anticancer
therapies. However, the exact mechanism by which oxidative
phosphorylation or mitochondrial biogenesis regulates Notch1
activation warrants further investigation.
FGF1 expression was potently induced in several TNBC cell
lines upon inhibition of TORC1/2. This is consistent with a recent
report by Wilson and colleagues that showed that FGFR ligands
can blunt the efﬁcacy of several kinase inhibitors across multiple
oncogene-dependent tumor cell lines (33). Another report
showed that treatment of HER2þ breast cancer cells with the
HER2 inhibitor lapatinib increased the expression of FGFR1 as a
mechanism of lapatinib resistance (30). In the study herein,
both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of FGFR decreased
MLN128-induced TFAM expression and mitochondrial metabolism (Fig. 6). The link between FGFR1 and mitochondrial activity
is consistent with a report using FGFR1-ampliﬁed lung cancer and
leukemia cell lines. In this study, FGFR1 was shown to localize in
mitochondria and phosphorylate pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
1 (PDHK1). The inactivating phosphorylation of PDHK1 results
in activation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which, in
turn, drives the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and favor
oxidative phosphorylation (34). In multiple TNBC cell lines we
observed increased expression of the cleaved form of FGFR1 upon
MLN128 treatment. This cleaved form of FGFR1 has been shown
to localize in the nucleus and mitochondria, where it mediates

oxidative phosphorylation and induces cellular invasion (34, 35).
Thus, activation of Notch1 via increased mitochondrial metabolism may be a key event in resistance to anticancer therapies. The
mechanism by which FGFR1 regulates TFAM expression remains
to be investigated.
In summary, we have identiﬁed a mechanism by which
TORC1/2 inhibitors sustain a Notch1-dependent tumorigenic
population with CSC traits. We propose that this mechanism
explains at least in part the limited clinical activity of these drugs as
single agents. As a result, therapeutic targeting of Notch1 may be a
promising direction to limit this tumor-initiating population and
potentially enhance the antitumor effect of TORC1/2 inhibitors in
TNBC. Additionally, we have shown that Notch1 is activated via a
FGFR1–TFAM-dependent mechanism introducing additional
molecular targets (Fig. 6H) that can be exploited in clinical trials
in tumors with alterations in the PI3K/mTOR pathway.
