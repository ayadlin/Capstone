ABSTRACT:
The tumor suppressor gene, Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), is frequently mutated in
the most common form of kidney cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC). In
hypoxic conditions, or when there is a VHL mutation, the hypoxia inducible factors,
HIF1α and HIF2α, are stabilized and transcribe a panel of genes associated with
cancer such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet derived
growth factor (PDGF), and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Recent studies in clear cell
kidney cancer have suggested that HIF2α, but not HIF1α, is the critical oncoprotein
in the VHL pathway. Therefore, targeting HIF2α could provide a potential therapeutic
approach for patients with advanced CCRCC. Since iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) is
known to inhibit the translation of HIF2α, we investigated whether Tempol, a stable
nitroxide that activates IRP1 towards IRE-binding, might have a therapeutic effect on
a panel of human CCRCC cells expressing both HIF1α and HIF2α. We first evaluated
the protein expression of HIF1α and HIF2α in 15 different clear cell renal carcinoma
cell lines established from patient tumors in our laboratory. Tempol decreased the
expression of HIF2α, and its downstream targets in all the cell lines of the panel.
This effect was attributed to a dramatic increase of IRE-binding activity of IRP1.
Several cell lines were found to have an increased IRP1 basal activity at 20% O2
compared to 5% O2, which may lower HIF2α expression in some of the cell lines in a
VHL-independent manner. Taken together our data identify Tempol as an agent with
potential therapeutic activity targeting expression of HIF2α in VHL-deficient clear
cell kidney cancer and illustrate the importance of studying biochemical processes
at relevant physiological O2 levels.

INTRODUCTION

of the VHL gene is associated with ubiquitination and
degradation of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) through
an oxygen-sensing mechanism [5,6]. In normoxia, HIF1α
and HIF2α are hydroxylated by prolyl-hydroxylases
in an iron-dependent manner. This post-translational
modification allows recognition of HIF by the VHL
complex and leads to its degradation by the proteasome
[7,8]. However, in the absence of oxygen, or in the

In the United States, an estimated 64,770 new
cases of kidney cancers will be diagnosed in 2012 and
about 13,570 people will die of this disease [1]. The
most common type of kidney cancers, clear cell renal
cell carcinoma (CCRCC), is associated with mutations
of the VHL gene [2,3,4]. In normal tissues, the product

All of the cells expressed HIF2α, but some, including 7860 [7], UOK111, UOK121 and UOK151 did not express
HIF1α or expressed a shorter 75kDa splice isoform.
Interestingly although expressed in UOK154, HIF2α
protein levels were low relative to other VHL-deficient
cells.

presence of a mutated VHL gene, HIF1α and HIF2α
are stabilized and induce the expression of a panel of
transcriptional target genes such as VEGF, PDGF, and
GLUT1, supporting the metabolic shift that underlies
CCRCC tumorigenicity [9]. Even in presence of oxygen,
clear cell kidney cancer cells with VHL gene mutation
display a “pseudo-hypoxic” phenotype. Although the
degradation of both HIF1α and HIF2α are regulated by
VHL [10,11], HIF2α has been thought to be the dominant
oncoprotein in VHL-deficient CCRCC cells [12,13,14]. It
was also recently suggested that HIF1α may function as a
tumor suppressor gene in VHL-deficient clear cell kidney
cancer [15]. However, despite the proposed critical role
of HIF2α in VHL-deficient CCRCC tumorigenesis, only a
few HIF2α inhibitors have been described [16,17].
A molecular link between HIF2α expression and
iron availability has recently been reported [18]. HIF2α,
but not HIF1α, has an iron-responsive element (IRE) in the
5’ untranslated region (UTR) of its mRNA. Thus, when
the cells are deficient in iron, the iron regulatory proteins
(IRPs) repress the translation of HIF2α protein by binding
to its 5’IRE. In addition, Ghosh et al. have recently
shown that a stable nitroxide, Tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl) partially restored the
phenotypes of IRP2 knockout mice by activating the IRE
binding activity of IRP1 and thus partially compensating
for the loss of IRP2 [19].
In this report, using a panel of VHL-deficient
CCRCC cell lines that express increased either HIF1α or
HIF2α or both, we investigated whether Tempol inhibits
the translation of HIF2α by inducing the IRE binding
activity of IRP1 and whether Tempol might be a potential
targeted therapy for CCRCC.

Tempol decreases HIF2α protein expression and
inhibits its downstream targets.
We then assessed the effect of Tempol on HIF1α
and HIF2α protein levels. Tempol decreased HIF1α /
HIF2α levels in 786-0 cell line, which expresses only
HIF2α [7], and in UOK220 cell line, which expresses both
HIFα isoforms (Figure 2). The reduced form of Tempol
(Tempol-H), which was used as a negative control, had
no effect on either HIF1α or HIF2α expression (Figure
2). To further investigate the effect of Tempol on HIFα
activity and pathway, we assessed the level of nuclear
HIF2α following Tempol treatment (5mM, 24h; Figure
3A, supplementary figure 1). Using 30μg of nuclear
extracts and similar to that observed in the previous
experiment, Tempol significantly decreased the level of
nuclear HIF2α, suggesting that its transcriptional activity
was also compromised. The effect of Tempol on nuclear
HIF1α expression was, however, not consistent in all of
the cell lines (Figure 3, supplementary figure 1). We then
evaluated the expression of HIF2α downstream targets
following Tempol’s treatment. In 786-0 and UOK220
cells, both CA-9 expression and VEGF secretion, two
known HIF2α targets and therapeutic targets for CCRCC
[20,21], were found to be decreased after 24h of treatment
with 5mM Tempol (Figure 3B-C). Also, since HIFα is
known to play a role in regulating tumor cells metabolism,
we asked whether Tempol might have a metabolic effect
on 786-0 cells. As shown in Figure 3D and consistent
with our observation that Tempol’s effect on HIFα is
mainly on HIF2α, Tempol (24h, 5mM) did not affect the
extra-cellular acidification rate of 786-0 cells (ECAR), a
surrogate for lactate secretion. This is consistent with other
published works, such as the recent paper of Chiavarina et

HIF1α and HIF2α expression in CCRCC cell lines.
We first characterized the HIFα status of 15 RCC
cell lines with mutated VHL gene (Figure 1 and Table 1).

following inhibition of the proteasome with velcade (1µM,
24h). As shown in figure 5B, using 20μg of whole cell
lysates, Tempol still decreased HIF2α protein expression,
suggesting that Tempol’s effect on HIF2α happened at
the translational level. Because HIF2α expression and
iron availability have recently been linked [18] and that
Ghosh et al. have shown that Tempol is able to activate
the IRE binding activity of IRP1[19], we thus investigated
Tempol’s effect on iron availability and IRP1 activity. We
measured the amount of Fe2+ in cells following Tempol
treatment as the nitroxide agent Tempol is able to lower
Fe2+[23]. As shown in Figure 5C, Tempol significantly
decreased the amount of available Fe2+. In addition,
Tempol increased IRP1 activity in a panel of CCRCC
cell lines (Figure 5D-E), which inversely correlated with
HIF2α expression (Figure 5F, R2=1). Taken together these
data suggest that Tempol regulates HIF2α expression at the
translational level by increasing the IRE binding activity
of IRP1. Interestingly, the basal level of IRP1 activation
was highly increased in most of the cell lines at 21% O2
(Table 2) [24], suggesting that the O2 environment of the
cell culture in vitro also affects HIFα expression in VHLdeficient cells.

al which shows that HIF1α and not HIF2α is important for
glycolysis in a breast cancer model [22]. Further, the effect
of Tempol on HIF2α expression and on its downstream
targets was highly reproducible since it was also observed
in 12 other CCRCC cell lines displaying various HIF1α
and HIF2α expression patterns (Figure 4 and Figure 1).
Thus, our data suggest that Tempol is a potent HIF2α
inhibitor, regardless of the HIF1α status of the CCRCC
cell line studied.

Tempol’s effect on IRP1 activity correlates with
HIF2α.
To further investigate Tempol’s mechanism of action
and how it decreases HIF2α expression, we first assessed
whether Tempol might have an effect on HIF2α at a
transcriptional level. We quantified HIF2α mRNA levels
following Tempol treatment by semi-quantitative RT-PCR.
As shown in Figure 5A, 24h of Tempol treatment did not
significantly change the mRNA expression of HIF2α.
Then,in order to assess whether Tempol might have an
effect on HIF2α by inducing its degradation, we evaluated
the effect of Tempol (5mM, 24h) on HIF2α expression

the development of other type of tumors [27,28]. However,
to date, only few HIF2α inhibitors have been identified. In
this report, we identified the nitroxide Tempol as a potent
HIF2α inhibitor, with promising anti-tumor effects in a
panel of CCRCC tumor cell lines.
Mutations occurring on the VHL gene are a critical
event leading to CCRCC development in both sporadic
and hereditary forms of kidney tumors. This lack of VHL
function leads to the stabilization of both HIF1α and
HIF2α proteins as well as to an increase in DNA damage
[10,11,29]. Although the expression of both HIF1α and
HIF2α is similarly regulated by VHL, their roles in
tumor development, tumor metabolism, and response to
therapy are sometimes contrasted [12,22,30,31]. Thus,
although our goal was to identify a new HIF2α inhibitor,
we characterized the expression status of both HIF1α and
HIF2α in 15 VHL-deficient clear cell kidney cancer cell
lines and assessed the effect of Tempol on both HIFα
isoforms. Regardless of the differences in HIF1α and
HIF2α expression between CCRCC cell lines, Tempol
decreased the expression and function of HIF2α in all the
cell lines. Surprisingly, Tempol also decreased the protein

Due to the observed effect of Tempol on HIF2α,
CA9 and VEGF, all previously reported therapeutic targets
for CCRCC tumors, we investigated whether Tempol
might have an anti-tumor effect in CCRCC cells. Cell
cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that 48h treatment with
Tempol is cytotoxic to CCRCC cells in vitro (Figure 6A),
that Tempol inhibits the formation of colonies of 786-0
cells (Figure 6B), and inhibits the proliferation of CCRCC
cells 786-0 and UOK220 (Figure 6C). Also, Tempol
treatment (5mM) decreased by 50% the ability of 786-0
cells to form anchorage-independent colonies, a marker
of tumor transformation assessed by soft-agar colony
formation assay (6D).

DISCUSSION
Targeting HIF2α is of particular interest in cancer
therapy since HIF2α is the transcription factor of
numerous genes that have been involved not only in the
development of CCRCC growth [20,21,25,26] but also in

Figure 2: Tempol decreases HIFα expression. A. To assess the effect of Tempol on HIFα expression in CCRCC cells, 786-0

cells were treated with several concentrations of Tempol for 24h or 48h before to be subjected to whole protein lyses, SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting for both HIFα isoforms. As previously reported 786-0 cells do not express HIF1α protein [7]. The CCRCC cell line
UOK220 cell was used as a positive control for HIF1α and HIF2α antibodies. The reduced form of Tempol (hydroxy-Tempol, T-H) was also
used as a negative control. B. A similar treatment regiment using Tempol was made using UOK220 cell line, a CCRCC cell line expressing
both HIF1α and HIF2α. We used untreated lysates of 786-0 as a negative control for the HIF1α antibody and as a positive control for the
HIF2α antibody. The reduced form of Tempol (hydroxy-Tempol, T-H) was also used as a negative control.

cell lines. As HIF1α does not have an IRE-binding domain,
the reasons underlying Tempol’s effect on HIF1α remain
unknown, especially as it was inconsistent throughout
the panel. Also, further work will be necessary to assess

whether this effect on HIF1α might be beneficial or not for
the survival of the tumors. Nevertheless, Tempol’s effect

Cell lines and cell culture
The UOK cell lines (UOK-111, 115, 121, 122, 127,
130, 139, 140, 143, 150, 151, 154, 161, and UOK220)
were established in the Urologic Oncology Branch
(National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) [32]. 786-0 and

confluence.

element in the 5’-UTR of HIF2α mRNA regulating
HIF2α translation (but not HIF1α) links HIF2α and iron
metabolism. This also opens new therapeutic strategies to
selectively target HIF2α. When Ghosh and collaborators
demonstrate that Tempol is able to activate the IRE
binding activity of IRP1[19], we thus hypothesized that
Tempol might also be able to inhibit HIF2α translation.
In this report, we demonstrated that the decrease in
expression of HIF2α following Tempol treatment
significantly correlated with an increased activation of
IRP1, reinforcing the link between IRP1 activity and
HIF2α expression. Moreover, Tempol treatment decreased
CCRCC cells viability, clonogenicity, proliferation, as well
as anchorage-independent growth. Thus, by regulating
the iron metabolism of CCRCC cells, Tempol may have
a potential therapeutic value for cancers dependent on
HIF2α for growth and survival, such as CCRCC tumors.
Interestingly, at 21%O2, most of the CCRCC cell
lines (with the exception of UOK150) were found to
have an artificially high level of IRP1 activity (Table2).
This suggests that culturing CCRCC cells at 21%O2 may
artificially lower HIF2α expression in a VHL-independent
manner by oxidizing the [4Fe-4S] center in aconitase,
and therefore, activating the IRE-binding form of IRP1.
These findings highlight the importance of working in an
in vitro condition that properly recreates the in vivo tumor
environment [24].
Although significant progress in understanding the
genetic basis of kidney cancer has been made over the
past twenty years, there is still a need for the development
of effective forms of therapy for patients with advanced
kidney cancer. Since the identification of the VHL gene,
seven novel agents that target the VHL pathway have
been approved by the FDA. However, there are few
complete responses to these agents and most patients
develop resistance to therapy and develop progressive
disease. Targeting HIF2α with an agent such as Tempol
has the potential to inhibit the oncoprotein critical to clear
cell kidney cancer carcinogenicity. The findings in this
work may provide the foundation for the development
of effective forms of therapy for this and other HIF2αdependent cancers.

Chemical agents
Tempol and hydroxyl-Tempol were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO).

Immunoblotting
Ten to thirty micrograms of protein was loaded
in 4-20% polyacrylamide gels (Biorad, Hercules, CA).
After elelectropheresis, the proteins were transferred on
PVDF membranes before being blocked with 5% fat-free
milk for at least 1h. Primary antibodies were incubated
over-night at 4°C. After serial washes with TBS-Tween,
Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies
(Sigma-Aldrich) were incubated 1-2h before development
with the ECL protein detection system (Pierce, Rockford,
IL). Goat anti-HIF2α antibody was obtained from R&D
Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rabbit antibodies against
β-actin, and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) were from Cell
Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Mouse HIF1
antibody was from BD Transduction (San Jose, CA). All
the antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution.

Cell cytotoxicity
Cell cytotoxicity was measured using the
tetrazolium
salt
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), as previously
described [33]. Briefly, 5,000 cells were seeded into 96well plate and treated as described in the results or figure
legends. After 48 hrs, the MTT salt was added into the
media (1:10) and incubated for 2 hrs at 37°C. During that
time, metabolically active cells transformed the yellow
MTT salt into purple formazan crystals. The media was
then removed and the crystals were solubilized in 100 µl
of DMSO. Data were read at 570nm. Cell survival was
assessed by the clonogenic assay. Exponentially growing
cells were exposed to Tempol (0.1 -5.0 mM) for 24-72
hr. Following treatment, cells were trypsinized, counted,
plated, and incubated for 10-14 days. Colonies were fixed

Lysate (x µl) containing 10 µg of total protein was added
to (12.5-x) µl of bandshift buffer containing 25 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 40 mM KCl. The samples were
incubated for 5 min at room temperature (RT) with 12.5 µl

WM, Klausner RD. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 247-255.

The ability of 786-0 cell line to form anchorageindependent colonies was assessed by soft-agar colony
formation assay. Two layered agarose gels of 0.5%
(bottom) or 0.4% (top) low melting agarase gels were
pored into 60mm dishes. Two hundred thousands 7860 cells were added to the top layer and cultured until
colonies were formed (about 3 weeks). Colonies with
a diameter of > 0.1 mm were then counted in 5 random
high-power fields using a phase contrast microscope.
