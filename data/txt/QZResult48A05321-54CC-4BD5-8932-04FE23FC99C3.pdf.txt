BACKGROUND. It is unclear whether new treatment modalities have improved the
survival of follicular lymphoma patients. Some data show that there has been no
improvement in survival in the last 3 decades of the 20th century, whereas the
results of recent retrospective studies suggest that evolving therapy has improved
the outcome for follicular lymphoma patients.

METHODS. To evaluate the impact of evolving therapies for follicular lymphoma,
particularly the introduction of rituximab, the overall survival (OS), failure-free
survival (FFS), and survival after recurrence (SAR) was analyzed in 438 advancedstage follicular lymphoma patients enrolled in consecutive Gruppo Italiano Studio Linfomi (GISL) trials between 1988 and 2004.

RESULTS. A stepwise improvement in FFS and a significant reduction in the hazard
ratio was observed with succeeding studies. Cox regression analysis showed an
improvement over time for OS, with a decline in the hazard ratio particularly
evident in the group treated with rituximab. Furthermore, the SAR significantly

ollicular lymphoma is the second most frequent form of nonHodgkin lymphoma in the Western world, accounting for 22% of
all cases.1 Treatment options for treatment-naive or recurring follicular lymphoma patients are still controversial, ranging from ‘‘watch
and wait’’ to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. However,
none of these treatments has demonstrated the potential to cure follicular lymphoma patients. It is also unclear whether new treatment
modalities have improved the survival of follicular lymphoma

patients. Some data show that there has been no
improvement in survival in the last 3 decades of the
20th century,2 whereas the results of recent retrospective studies3–5 suggest that evolving therapy has
improved the outcome for follicular lymphoma
patients.
Over the past 18 years the Gruppo Italiano Studio Linfomi (GISL) has conducted a series of Phase II
clinical trials in previously untreated or recurring follicular lymphoma patients. Patients enrolled in these
trials received anthracycline- and/or fludarabinebased regimens. Recently, the introduction of rituximab has considerably modified treatment strategies.
Since 1998 the GISL has performed a series of Phase
II studies utilizing rituximab in combination with
interferon (IFN) or chemotherapy. In the current
study we analyzed the overall survival (OS), failurefree survival (FFS), and survival after recurrence
(SAR) in various groups of patients to evaluate the
impact of evolving therapy including the introduction of rituximab.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between 1988 and 2004, 691 patients with indolent
lymphoma were enrolled in various GISL trials. To
address a uniform patient population in this study,
189 patients with indolent non-follicular lymphoma
were excluded. Furthermore, 64 patients with recurrence treated with rituximab 1 IFN were excluded
from this analysis because they were entered into the
M39008 Roche-sponsored trial (GISL FOLREC01) and
follow-up data were not available.6 Thus, for the purpose of this study we identified 438 advanced-stage
(IIB, III, and IV) patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of follicular lymphoma (grades 1, 2,
and 3) who had either previously untreated (307
patients) or recurring (131 patients) disease. The
number of patients in each group, the regimens, and
the time spans are summarized in Table 1. The baseline patient characteristics for each group are reported
in Table 2. Briefly, naive patients were treated in
groups 1–4 with 1 of following regimens: ProMECECytaBOM (methylprednisolone, cyclophosphadime,
epidoxorubicin, etoposide, citarabine, bleomycin, vincristine, and methotrexate)7; BACOP (bleomycin,
epidoxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
prednisone)8; BACOP1FND (BACOP plus fludarabine,
mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone)9; or BACOP1FR
(BACOP fludarabine 1 rituximab).10 Patients who
experienced recurrence were placed in groups 5 and 6
based on treatment with or without rituximab; specifically, with CHOP (cyclophosfamide, doxorubicine, vincristine, and prednisolone) or FC (fludarabine and

At the end of chemotherapy, involved field radiotherapy (IF-RT) was allowed to treat residual masses
or at the site of previous bulky or extranodal disease,
in either treatment-naive or relapsed patients, at the
treating physician’s discretion.

Statistical Analysis
All eligible patients entered into each of the previously described treatment groups were included in
the analysis. Clinical parameters were prospectively
registered at the time of the patient’s entry into each
study. OS was measured from the date of registration
until last follow-up or death from any cause. FFS was
calculated from the date of registration until disease
progression, relapse, or disease- or treatment-related
death. SAR was measured from the time of first recurrence until the last follow-up, or death from any
cause. Survival curves were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method.12 Fisher exact and chi-square
tests were used to asses differences in the distribution of clinical features among the different treatment groups. To analyze the association between
variables and OS, FFS, and SAR, Cox univariate and
log rank tests were used. The Cox regression model13
was utilized to determine the effect of multiple variables on OS and FFS. The proportionality of risk was
checked in all Cox regression analyses.
We used 2-sided P-values <.05 as moderate evidence against the null hypothesis.
The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI)14 was calculated for 281 (92%) of
the 307 untreated follicular lymphoma patients.

RESULTS
A total of 438 previously untreated (n ¼ 307) or
relapsed (n ¼ 131) follicular lymphoma patients who
met the defined eligibility criteria were included in this
analysis. Parameters with significant differences
among groups were age >60 years, clinical stage III-IV,
>4 nodal sites, FLIPI score, bulky disease (lymph node
mass with a maximum diameter >5 cm), and extranodal sites >1 (Table 2). By univariate analysis, we
observed a significant negative impact (P <.05) on FFS
and OS for age >60 years, elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, >4 nodal sites, and clinical stage III-IV that is
consistent with the FLIPI model. We also observed a
significant negative impact for B symptoms, elevated
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and low albumin
levels. More than 1 extranodal site affected only FFS,
whereas elevated beta-2 microglobulin only affected
OS. All of these parameters, which are not included in
the FLIPI model, are strictly associated with FLIPI score
(q between 0.24 and 0.30, P < .002). Furthermore, we
observed a significant positive impact (P ¼ .007) on
FFS for IF-RT treatment. Thus, to evaluate the effect of
variables with a significant impact on FFS we performed a Cox regression analysis adjusting for the
FLIPI model and IF-RT treatment. To evaluate the
effects on OS, we adjusted only for the FLIPI model.

FFS According to Treatment Program
The median FFS among the 307 untreated patients
was 60 months (Fig. 1). Median FFS times for
patients in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 40, 64, and 58
months, respectively. The median FFS for patients in
group 4, which included rituximab, has not yet been
reached after a median follow-up of 25 months
(range, 4 months to 46 months).
FFS curves according to treatment regimen are
shown in Figure 2. The curves for groups 2 and 3
overlap substantially after 36 months with a 4-year
FFS of 55% and 59%, respectively. The 4-year FFS for
groups 1 and 4 was 42% and 80%, respectively. The
FFS improved from group 1 to group 4 with evolving
treatment, and the overall P-value was <.05 for all
curves. After adjusting for FLIPI score and IF-RT
treatment, Cox regression analysis confirmed a sequential improvement over time as demonstrated by
a statistically significant decline in the hazard ratio
from group 1 to group 4 (Table 3).
OS According to Treatment Group
After a median follow-up of 58 months, the median
survival among all 307 previously untreated patients
has not been reached (Fig. 1). The 4-year estimates
of OS were 76%, 87%, 82%, and 97% in groups 1, 2,

DISCUSSION
Until a few years ago, there was a general consensus
that the outcome of low-grade lymphoma has not
changed over the last 30 years. For example, the
analysis of 25 years experience at Stanford University
in managing follicular lymphoma demonstrated no
survival improvement.2 However, this review ended
in 1992, before treatment with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab became available. Contrasting experiences were recently reported3–5
suggesting a stepwise improvement in FFS and OS
with the introduction of new treatment options over
the past few years.
The results of these studies prompted the current
analysis to assess the outcome of follicular lymphoma patients entered into GISL trials. The results
reported here summarize and update previous treatment strategies utilized at GISL between 1988 and
2004. We observed a stepwise improvement of FFS,
with the 4-year FFS estimate increasing from 42% to
82% from groups 1 to 4, respectively, and a significant reduction in the hazard ratio over succeeding
studies. After adjusting for the FLIPI score, the Cox
regression analysis showed an improvement over
time for OS, with a decline in the hazard ratio from
group 1 to group 4, demonstrating that the outcome
improvement is related to treatment and not confounded by a different distribution of clinical parameters among groups.
It is worth noting that in the group 4 patients
treated with rituximab, improvements in FFS and OS
were particularly evident, with reductions in the
hazard ratio for FFS and OS of 76% and 91%, respec-

2081

tively, in comparison with the ProMECE-CytaBOM
group, and of 51% and 71%, respectively, in comparison with the BACOP/FND group (Table 3). The difference for group 4 was statistically significant (except
for OS in group 2) in comparison with groups 1, 2, and
3 treated with chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, the
SAR according to salvage treatment showed a statistically significant improvement in the group of patients
treated with chemotherapy 1 rituximab in comparison with chemotherapy alone (Fig. 3). These data suggest that survival improvement is due, at least in part,
to an improvement in salvage therapy, and in particular to the introduction of rituximab in combination
with chemotherapy.
Further, the results of recently reported controlled studies in either previously untreated15–17 or
recurring18,19 follicular lymphoma patients demonstrated that the addition of rituximab to several different chemotherapies induces an improvement in
survival.
Finally, although conclusions between nonrandomized groups may depend on differences in observed and unobserved prognostic features, we
believe that the results of the multivariate analysis,
after adjusting for all parameters with an impact on
FFS and OS, suggest that rituximab therapy has a
favorable effect on the prognosis of follicular lymphoma
In summary, our data show that FFS and OS
have significantly improved in advanced-stage follicular lymphoma patients treated in GISL protocols
over the past 18 years. These improvements are
related to evolving front-line and salvage therapies,
and in particular to the introduction of rituximab in
combination with chemotherapy.
