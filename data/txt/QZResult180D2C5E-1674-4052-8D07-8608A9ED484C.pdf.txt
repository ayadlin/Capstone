ABSTRACT
We have previously shown that a specific promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid
receptor alpha (PML-RARA) DNA vaccine combined with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)
increases the number of long term survivors with enhanced immune responses
in a mouse model of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). This study reports the
efficacy of a non-specific DNA vaccine, pVAX14Flipper (pVAX14), in both APL and
high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS) models. PVAX14 is comprised of novel
immunogenic DNA sequences inserted into the pVAX1 therapeutic plasmid. APL mice
treated with pVAX14 combined with ATRA had increased survival comparable to
that obtained with a specific PML-RARA vaccine. Moreover, the survival advantage
correlated with decreased PML-RARA transcript levels and increase in anti-RARA
antibody production. In HR-MDS mice, pVAX14 significantly improved survival and
reduced biomarkers of leukemic transformation such as phosphorylated mitogenactivated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) 1. In both
preclinical models, pVAX14 vaccine significantly increased interferon gamma
(IFNγ) production, memory T-cells (memT), reduced the number of colony forming
units (CFU) and increased expression of the adapter molecule signalling to NF-κB,
MyD88. These results demonstrate the adjuvant properties of pVAX14 providing
thus new approaches to improve clinical outcome in two different models of myeloid
malignancies, which may have potential for a broader applicability in other cancers.

on the importance of adjuvants as crucial components of
successful vaccines. Furthermore, recent studies have been
focused on strategies to improve the immunogenicity of
DNA vaccines [4, 5].
Targeted therapies for hematological malignancies
have matured since the advent of all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA) to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)
[6]. APL is a specific subtype of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) characterized by the t(15;17) translocation
resulting in a PML-RARA (for promyelocytic leukemiaretinoic acid receptor alpha) fusion protein. Boosting
the immune system of leukemia patients in complete
remission offers a novel approach. In previous studies, we
demonstrated that a specific PML-RARA DNA vaccine,
when combined with ATRA, improved survival over
treatment with ATRA alone, with a protective effect that
was B and T-cell mediated [7, 8, 9].
However, most hematological malignancies
lack specific oncoproteins, making specific DNA
immunotherapies inappropriate. This is particularly the
case for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), characterized
by ineffective hematopoiesis leading to blood cytopenias,
frequent progression to AML, and which generally remain,
despite recent therapeutic progress with azacitidine
(AZA), incurable. Allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT),
whose efficacy largely relies on immunotherapy, remains
the only curative treatment of MDS [10]. Nevertheless,
only very few high risk (HR)-MDS patients may benefit
from allogeneic SCT due to the median age and the need
of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatible donor.
Immunotherapeutic approaches in HR-MDS can take
advantage of the immune surveillance elicited by the MDS
malignant clone in MDS patients. Indeed, MDS, before
it transforms into AML, is characterized by an increased
apoptosis of hematopoietic precursors, potentially
resulting in tumor antigens being presented to the immune
system and evoking an adaptive immune response.
Activated T cells and clonal T-cell expansions are found
in some MDS patients [11, 12] with reported decreased
frequencies of regulatory T-cells, further documenting the
role of immune surveillance [11].
In order to develop a DNA adjuvant approach to
enhance endogenous anti-tumor immune response we
designed a pVAX1-based DNA vaccine. In this study,
we characterized a non-specific vaccine, designated
pVAX14Flipper (pVAX14) and we evaluated its potential
therapeutic effects in two different preclinical models of
myeloid malignancies.

Impact of the pVAX14 vaccine on survival and
tumor burden of APL and HR-MDS mice
To assess the efficacy of the pVAX14 vaccine, we
first used, as a proof of concept, the APL mouse model
[13] where we previously identified and documented the
enhanced survival induced by the specific vaccine PMLRARA in combination with ATRA compared with either
ATRA alone or ATRA+pcDNA3 empty vector [8]. In the
APL preclinical model (protocol in Figure 1A, upper
part) treatment with ATRA alone controlled disease up to
50 days. Survival of the APL mice treated by ATRA in
combination with the specific PML-RARA as well as with
the non-specific pVAX14 was significantly (p < 0.0001
and p < 0.0014, respectively) superior to that of the mice
treated by ATRA alone (Figure 1B, Supplementary Table
S1). As we previously reported with the specific vaccine
[7] a significant reduction of bone marrow (BM) APL
blasts and increase in presence of differentiated cells was
also observed in ATRA+pVAX14-treated mice on day
160 (Figure 1C). After day 50 relapses were seen with
the recurrence of thrombocytopenia (Figure 2A). As in
our PML-RARA published study [14], the low levels of
PML-RARA transcripts of the ATRA+pVAX14-treated
mice (Figure 2B) correlated with the achieved survival
advantage and with rescue of thrombocytopenia in some of
the mice (Figure 2A). The combined results of enhanced
survival, MRD, platelet monitoring and the clearance of
BM APL blasts demonstrated that in this APL preclinical
model the non-specific pVAX 14 had an anti-leukemic
effect.
Using a similar protocol in the HR-MDS preclinical
model [15] (Figure 1A, lower part), treatment with
pVAX14 significantly extended survival compared to
placebo-treated mice (Figure 1D, p < 0.0001) with a
reduction of BM blast cells by day 40 (Figure 1E). As
shown in Figure 2C and 2D, some of the pVAX14-treated
MDS mice had a recovery of platelet counts, which
correlated with increased survival and no significant
changes in circulating blasts (Mac-1+/Gr-1lo). We have
been looking for objective parameters of controlled
MDS disease and we took advantage of our data showing
disease-associated changes in one of the MEK isoforms.
As shown in Figure 2E, when MEK1 profiles were
analysed using the Nanopro assay, we have been able to
identify the MEK1 isoform (peak 1 arrowed) present only
in HR-MDS mice. This MEK1 isoform showed qualitative
changes (dephosphorylation) when spleen samples from
HR-MDS mice treated with pVAX14 were analysed
(Figure 2E - peak 2 arrowed). Thus our data showed that
treatment with a non-specific pVAX14 vaccine can have a
pronounced effect on the survival of HR-MDS mice.

homology to a known protein in Genbank databases
(Supplementary Table S3).
The potential immunogenicity of the 10 peptides
synthesized to cover the 6 ORFs was tested in normal
FVB/N mice. Mice received peptide injections as
illustrated in the protocol (Figure 3C) and sera were
harvested on day 35 (D35) and assayed for Ig production.
Only 4 of the 10 peptides induced a significant increase
of Ig (Figure 3C); these were peptides 1, 2, 5-1 and 5-2
(the latter two are overlapping peptides of ORF 5). Of
note, no significant signs of adverse effects were observed
after peptide injections or in the pVAX14-treated mice
as compared to controls (Supplementary Figure S1B).
In normal FVB/N mice, apart from PB memory T-cells
(memT) as expected of DNA (Supplementary Figure S1C),
injections of pVAX14 did not differ significantly from
the placebo treatment: i.e. no significant differences in
interferon gamma (IFNγ) producing cells (Supplementary
Figure S1D) and the adapter MyD88 expression
(Supplementary Figure S1E).

When used as a vaccine in combination with
ATRA in the APL model antibodies to all of the predicted
peptides were observed in the sera of some of the mice
(Figure 4A). Three out of 8 treated mice (mouse nos. 6,
7, 8) had detectable antibodies to all 10 peptides, 3 had
some antibodies to certain peptides (mouse nos. 1, 2, 3)
and 2 mice failed (mouse nos. 4, 5) to mount an antibody
response.
As we have previously reported with the specific
vaccine [8,9] the combination of ATRA+pVAX14
significantly increased the production of anti-RARA
antibodies compared with ATRA alone. To identify the
impact of pVAX14 on the production of anti-RARA
antibodies sera from mice treated with ATRA alone or
combined to pVAX14 were tested by ELISA (Figure
4). Our results show that like the specific vaccine
ATRA+pVAX14 significantly increases the production of
anti-RARA antibodies (Figure 4B, p < 0.0003).

DISCUSSION

In order to determine markers of clinical outcome
of pVAX14 treatment, we have compared the level of
IFNγ producing cells, memT and MyD88 expression in
placebo- and pVAX14-treated APL and HR-MDS mice.
We have also evaluated the cytotoxic effects of CD3+ cells
originated from pVAX14-vaccinated animals against APL
and HR-MDS BM precursors.
We have previously shown [7, 8] an increase in
IFNγ production in APL mice treated with the ATRA and
specific vaccine after stimulation with either irradiated
APL cells or PMLRARA specific peptides. As shown
in Figure 5A, pVAX14 in combination with ATRA also
increased the numbers of IFNγ producing cells in both
APL stimulated by APL cells (Figure 5A) or specific
PML-RARA peptides (data not shown). Treatment with
pVAX14 significantly increased the number of IFNγ
producing cells in the HR-MDS preclinical model (Figure
5B; p < 0.05).
Percentages of memT were significantly higher in
ATRA+pVAX14-treated APL (Figure 5C; p < 0.05) as
well as HR-MDS (Figure 5D; p < 0.01) mice compared
with control (ATRA in APL and placebo in HR-MDS)
mice. The memT levels of pVAX14 and PML-RARAtreated groups were similar (Supplementary Figure S2A).
To evaluate the cytotoxic activity of T cells against
precursor cells, we applied assays described by Quintarelli
et al [17] of APL or HR-MDS BM targets and CD3+
spleen cells from ATRA- or ATRA+pVAX14-treated
APL and placebo- or pVAX14-treated HR-MDS mice,
respectively. CD3+ cells co cultured with diseased BM
were assessed for colony-forming capacity. As shown in
Figure 5, CD3+ cells from ATRA+pVAX14-treated APL
(Figure 5E) and pVAX14-treated HR-MDS (Figure 5F)
had specific cytotoxic effects against APL and HR-MDS
precursors, which resulted in a consistent and significant
reduction of CFU compared to the culture of CD3+
cells from ATRA-treated APL or placebo-treated HRMDS mice. These APL-derived effectors had no effect
on normal FVB/N BM CFUs (Supplementary Figure
S2B). Furthermore depletion of CD4+ cells of APL long
term survivors showed that these cells were required to
maintain remissions (Supplementary Figure S2C).
Transcript levels of MyD88, an adaptor molecule
downstream of toll-like receptor (TLR)s signalling were
significantly higher in APL mice (Figure 5G) treated with
pVAX14+ATRA compared to mice treated with ATRA
alone (p < 0.0002) as well as in the pVAX14-treated group
of HR-MDS mice (Figure 5H) compared to the placebotreated control (p < 0.05).
Taken together, in two different preclinical
models of myeloid malignancies (APL and HR-MDS)
the survival advantage induced by the pVAX14 vaccine
was concomitant with increases in IFNγ producing cells,
memT, leukemic precursor-specific CD3+ cells and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

As we had previously reported with the specific
PML-RARA in the APL model [8], the non-specific
pVAX14 in the APL and also in HR-MDS preclinical
models was shown to be effective in controlling disease
and prolonging survival. Whether for the PML-RARA
specific DNA vaccine in the APL model [7, 8, 14, 9] or
the pVAX14 non-specific DNA vaccine in both models,
the responses obtained were those known for DNAbased immunotherapy. These include activation of
T-cell mediated responses measured by the inhibition of
leukemic progenitor growth accompanied by increased
IFNγ production, memT, upregulation of MyD88 and in
the case of the transplantable APL model, relapse of longlived mice after CD4+-cell depletion. We had previously
shown with the specific vaccine PML-RARA the benefit
of its combination with ATRA, not only on improving
survival but also in enhancing biomarkers of response [7].
In the APL mouse, prolonged survival was
correlated with PML-RARA MRD reduction and reduction
of BM blasts. As this is a transplantable model long term
survivors were obtained and some of these were followed
up to 2 years, close to the lifespan of a mouse. For the HRMDS transgenic mouse model treated with pVAX14 alone,
we took advantage of novel biomarkers of the disease
we have efficiently used in another novel therapeutic
approach [18], and showed that RAS signaling protein
dephosphorylation of MEK detected by NanoPro was
restored. Despite the persistence of disease as detected
by no change overall of the PB Mac1+/Gr-1lo population,
treatment with pVAX14 reduced the BM blasts enabling
the mice to cope with their disease and prolonged lifespan. As this is a transgenic mouse model the mice
inevitably relapsed once the protective effects were lost
and the cells expressing the transgenes expanded.
Vaccination strategies employed in anti-leukemia
immunotherapy to date have fallen largely in two
categories. Firstly, vaccines against known antigens or
epitopes which are peptide-based, such as PR1, a 9-mer
peptide of proteinase-3 with high predicted binding and
Wilm’s Tumor (WT)-1 are shown to lead to specific T-cell
responses in myeloid leukemia patients [19]. Secondly,
vaccines using primarily whole cells such as leukemic
dendritic cells, cell lysates and tumor cell lines modified
to produce cytokines have been reported in AML clinical
trials [20, 21, 22, 23]. For example, administration of
autologous dendritic cells (DC) loaded via electroporation
with WT-1 mRNA resulted in complete remission in 50%
of AML patients in a phase I/II study [24].
However, targeted vaccine approaches have
limitations. Peptide-induced immune responses towards
cells expressing only one epitope do not induce memory
of the anti-tumor immune responses, explaining why the

effects are short-lived. Likewise, cell based therapies
such as modified dendritic cells are specific to each
individual [25, 26]. DNA vaccines are not restricted to
a given epitope or to a given individual. DNA vaccines
have the disadvantage of being weak inducers of antitumor
effects on their own (reviewed in [27]), and require being
associated with agents that enhance immune response and/
or delivery. Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) has often been added to vaccines or used
as a vaccine itself [28, 29, 30] and electroporation with the
DNA injection has been effectively used to boost immune
responses [1]. The DNA encoding an immunogenic
peptide is taken up by either the muscle cells or antigen
presenting cells (APCs); so this is analogous to an in
vivo transfection [3]. The muscle cell then processes the
sequences and antigen is released, seen by B and T-cells
to induce both humoral and cytotoxic T-cell responses
[3]. That we observe antibody responses to each of the
peptides following pVAX14+ATRA treatment of APL cells
supports the production of a humoral response following
pVAX14 DNA injections. Clinical trials with DNA
plasmids have shown enhancement of specific immune
responses including antibody production, proliferation
of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, antigen-dependent
cytotoxicity, and cytokine secretion [31]. Many DNA
plasmids harbour CpG motifs in their sequence, which
signal through TLR9, leading to the induction of antigen
presentation through major histocompatibility complex
(MHC)-I, MHC-II molecules, co‑stimulatory molecules
expression and cytokine secretion [31]. CpG containing
oligonucleotides have been used in clinical trials [32,33],
but the ease of manufacture and stability of plasmids
make them attractive tools with increased signalling
towards NF-κB as observed with upregulation of MyD88
upon treatment with pVAX14. Furthermore, our construct
contains 5 ORFs, which we show to be transcribed and
encoding immunogenic peptides, to which vaccinated APL
animals develop antibodies.
In our previous studies, we had highlighted the
documented effects of Vitamin A and ATRA on the
immune system such as increased proliferation of T
lymphocytes [34, 35], increased synthesis of Igs by B
lymphocytes [36], and the induction of differentiation of
dendritic cells to enhance antigen presentation [37]. More
recently, ATRA has been shown to suppress myeloid
derived suppressor cells [38]. We showed that a specific
vaccine in combination with ATRA rescued 50% of the
APL mice from relapse and death unlike DNA or ATRA
alone where all the mice relapsed and died; this protective
effect was T and B-cell mediated [7, 8, 9]. This stresses the
importance of ATRA as an immunomodulator.
Tumor associated antigens have not yet been
identified for all tumors and in hematological disorders
multiple factors may be involved and major oncogenic
proteins have not yet been identified impeding the transfer
of the concept. Non-specific boosting of the anti-tumor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

response has been used in clinical practice as early as
bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG); a BCG based vaccine
has been shown to protect against cancers [39]. In AML,
the combination of histamine and interleukin-2 (IL-2) has
been shown to stimulate immune responses and achieve
prolonged survival in a Phase III study, however, side
effects were limiting [40]. The pVAX14 DNA approach
appears thus a potential alternative approach. DNA
vaccines are well tolerated and offer a good alternative
to control progression to leukemia and to prevent relapse
[41].
Although past history has shown the good tolerance
of DNA vaccines, regulations are in place to ensure that
vaccine manufacture provides a safe product. Preclinical
studies have shown that DNA vaccines are unlikely
to cause systemic auto-immune disease, and that at the
administered doses, integration has so far not been an
issue. Preliminary toxicology test of pVAX14 in rodents
suggest absence of toxicity (data not shown). PVAX14
comprises the pVAX1 backbone, which has no mutations
and this vector is already used in clinical practice with no
reported adverse effects [42].
We hypothesize that the pVAX14 construct is acting
as an adjuvant, boosting pre-existing immune responses
initiated by the antigens from the malignant cells as
evidenced by the increase in anti-RARA antibodies in
the APL model and consequent reduction in PML-RARA
transcripts. It has been shown that chemotherapy such as
anthracyclins can induce immunogenic cell death ([43] and
reviewed in [44]) and azacitidine, the standard treatment
for HR-MDS patients is also an immunomodulator [45].
Extended survival obtained in the HR-MDS model
together with dephosphorylation of the RAS signalling
protein MEK shows its effect in this mouse model. Only
a phase I trial in humans will provide the required data of
safety and efficacy; however, our data confirm progress
in the field of anti-tumor immunotherapy and underscore
the potential of a non-specific DNA vaccine to control
myeloid diseases in preclinical models. The efficacy of
a vaccine is determined by the magnitude, duration and
quality of the immune response it induces. Depending
upon the disease, both the innate and adaptive arms of the
immune system may contribute to protection. Despite the
biological heterogeneity of different cancers, which may
influence the immune system in different ways, adjuvants
such as DNA, may have efficacy in a variety of cancers
where immunogenic apoptosis has been induced by either
the pro-apoptotic features of the disease or by previous
therapy or in combination with an immunomodulator.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Experiments - Paris Nord C2EA-121, approval no. 2014IUH006).

Plasmids (pcDNA3PML-RARA, pVAX1 and
pVAX14)

Tissue and cell preparation
Differential blood counts were obtained using
an automated hematology analyzer (Cell Dyn, Abbott
Diagnostics, France or MedoniCA620, Stockholm,
Sweden). White PB cells were analyzed by flow cytometry
as previously described [15] (FACS Calibur, Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, California, USA). BM was obtained
by flushing long bones with RPMI media (L-Glutamine
200 mM, 2% Fetal Bovine Serum, penicillin/
streptomycin). PB and BM smears were prepared
according to standard hematological techniques. The cells
were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 400
g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml
of PBS. Cell counting was performed in the presence of
Nigrosine or trypan blue (0.4%), which is taken up by dead
cells. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in sterile
PBS for transplants injected intravenously (IV). Murine
spleen cells were harvested and disrupted in RPMI.

The specific pcDNA3PMLRARA-FrC (PML-RARA)
construct previously reported by us [7, 8, 9] included
the pcDNA3 vector, which is now limited on clinical
use due to its ampicillin resistance. PVAX1 is a plasmid
vector designed to be consistent with the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) requirements (Docket no. 96N0400, 1996) and accepted for clinical trials as based on
kanamycin resistance for selection. We thus engineered a
construct, consisting of the DNA plasmid vector pVAX1,
with an inserted novel nucleotide sequence of 824 bp,
which arose as a recombination between part of the
kanamycin resistance gene (nucleotides1226-1701) and
the pVAX1 adjacent sequence (nucleotides 873-1225)
inverted and reversed so that the antisense strand became
the sense strand in reverse, hence we named this construct
pVAX14Flipper (pVAX14). The insert recombined into
the BamHI site of the multiple cloning site fused in
frame to the pVAX1 backbone to create an open reading
frame (ORF) and abolishing the bovine growth hormone
polyadenylation site (BGH poly A). The clone was
sequenced using the Genomic and Sequencing Platform
of Institut Cochin (Paris) and the insertion was stable.

APL model
A transplantable APL model derived from transgenic
mice with the PML-RARA breakpoint cluster region 1
(bcr1) of APL was used and treated with ATRA (5mg,
Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, Florida, USA)
as previously described [13]. Sampling was done on days
indicated in the Figure legends. Disease was monitored
by clinical and blood measurements and by PML-RARA
mRNA for minimal residual disease (MRD). As we had
observed previously that depletion of CD4+ cells resulted
in relapses, CD4+ cells were depleted in long term
survivors (120 days) by injecting anti-CD4 antibodies
weekly as we previously described [7].

Expression of open reading frames (ORFs)
Plasmid DNA (20 mg or 15 mg) was introduced
into monkey kidney cells (COS) or human Phoenix
cells via electroporation or calcium phosphate as per
manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma). After 48 h incubation
at 37o C under 95% air/5% CO2, cells were harvested
and RNA extracted immediately. Gene expression
was calculated for each probe set (Table S2) using the
comparative Delta Delta Ct (ΔΔCt) method [46] of empty
vector or pVAX14-vector against the untransfected RNA,
all normalized against ABL as the house keeping gene.

HR-MDS model
Mutant neuroblastoma-Rasheed sarcoma virus
cellular homologue (NRAS)D12 with a substitution
of aspartic acid at amino acid position 12 and B cell
lymphoma 2 (BCL-2)-mediated HR-MDS mice as we
previously described were used [15]. Briefly, NRASD12
mice were crossed with hemizygote mouse mammary
tumor virus long terminal repeat (MMTV) transactivator
(tTA) mice (MMTVtTA) mice. Tetracycline inducible
BCL-2 mice (TetoBCL-2.1 line) [15] were crossed with
hemizygote MMTVtTA mice. The double transgenic
MMTVtTA/NRASD12 mice were then crossed with the
MMTVtTA/TBCL-2 mice to generate MMTVtTA/TBCL-2/
NRASD12 mice. The disease is described as similar to HRMDS in patients [15]. The mice were bred and genotyped

Animal models and treatment protocols
BM and spleen cells were prepared as previously
described [8]. All mice were of the Friend leukemia
Virus B strain from the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) (FVB/N) and were maintained under pathogen
free conditions in the barrier facilities of the Institut
Universitaire d’Hématologie. Procedures involving
animals and their care conformed to institutional
guidelines that comply with national and international
laws and policies and were authorized by the local
ethical committee (Committee on the Ethics of Animal

using standard husbandry and PCR techniques as described
previously [15]. PB BCL-2 expression was performed by
flow cytometry using the human specific fluorescence
isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated anti-BCL-2 antibody
using manufacturer’s protocols (BD Pharmingen, San
Diego, CA, USA). PB was labelled with the homing cell
adhesion molecule (Mac-1) conjugated to phycoerythrin
(PE) and GPI-linked myeloid differentiation marker (Gr1) conjugated to FITC obtained and used according to the
Manufacturer’s protocols (BD Pharmingen, San Diego,
CA, USA). All measurements were performed using BD
FACS Calibur or Facs Canto flow cytometer. Analysis
was performed using the Cellquest software. Mice were
followed for disease by measuring blood counts (Medonic
CA620, Stockholm, Sweden) and PB BCL-2 and increased
Mac1+/Gr1lo levels, within which the blast cell population
is located and recruited to trial once the platelet counts fell
below 1300 x103/mm3 at 3-6 months of age. This reduction
in platelet count and their recovery upon treatment tracks
the disease well and correlates with survival [15]. This
disease is transplantable and was assessed by IV injection
of spleen cells (107) of diseased mice into lethally
irradiated (5 Grays twice with an interval of 4 hours)
FVB/N syngeneic recipients [7, 15, 8, 14].

mouse MyD88 cloned by our laboratory were used to
generate the standard curves. The reference gene used was
mouse Abl, which was cloned by our laboratory. Target
genes were ran for each sample in triplicate. In order
to quantify the samples, a standard curve was software
generated according to the Ct obtained with the diluted
plasmids. The copy number of the gene of interest for
each sample was determined as a function of the detected
fluorescence extrapolated from the standard curve. The
pVAX14+ATRA-treated group was stratified according
to survival below or above the median of individual
protocols.

Isoelectric focusing protein analyses (NanoPro)
Splenocytes (1x106) were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer and subjected
to a nanofluidic proteomic immunoassay (NIA) run on the
NanoPro1000 [48] (ProteinSimple, Santa Clara, CA) using
mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated
kinase kinase (MEK) antibodies. Proteins were separated
according to their isoelectric point (ip). Protein (0.1 mg/ml
of lysate) in a final volume of 15µl was loaded in a 384well plate with 5-8 gradient ampholyte mix. Antibodies
were diluted in ProteinSimple antibody diluent: mitogenactivated protein kinase (MEK1 (Upstate 07-641,
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Actin (BD Bioscience,
Paris, France) was used as a control for protein loading.
Samples were run in triplicate.

Vaccination protocol
For normal (FVB/N), APL and HR-MDS mice,
2x50µg DNA in the vehicle [Hepes buffered saline
solution (HBSS)] was injected intramuscularly (IM) in
each of the quadriceps every 20 days for 3 cycles. Blood
samples were collected at different time points to monitor
disease and biomarkers. Control mice were treated with
IM injections of the vehicle.
For APL 104 cells were transplanted by IV injection
into syngeneic 6-8 week old FVB/N mice. During the
course of the study, two lines derived from transgenic
mice (935 and 909), which gave identical APL-like
diseases, were used. Treatment of the APL model: ATRA
21-day slow release pellets (5 mg) (Innovative Research
of America, Sarasota, Florida, USA) were administered
on day 6 after injection of APL cells. Control APL mice
were treated with IM injections of HBSS [8]. Sampling
was done on days indicated in the legends. Mice were
monitored by clinical and blood measurements to monitor
disease, as previously and PML-RARA mRNA for MRD
detection.

Immunogenicity of ORF predicted peptides
sequences
	 Peptides encoded by the sequences delineated
(ORFs 1-6, Supplementary Figure S1A) were synthesized
as shown (Supplementary Table S3) and tested for
immunogenicity in normal FBV/N mice. As ORFs 5
and 6 were 60-mers, 3 overlapping peptides for each
were synthesized. Briefly, plates coated with each of the
peptides were cultured with sera from peptide treated mice
and immunoglobulin (Ig) G production was measured.

Evaluation of biomarkers
Anti-RARA or anti-pVAX14 peptide antibody
levels were measured by ELISA using a method described
previously [8].
Briefly, for RARA antibody detection sera from
vaccinated APL mice were added to plates coated with
recombinant RARA protein. Each test was performed in
duplicate. Specific absorbance (SA) was calculated by the
difference between the absorbance measured in the wells
coated with GST-RARA and the wells coated with control
GST. To minimize inter-assay variations, the specific

absorbance of each serum was divided by the specific
absorbance (SA) of 9α MAb (RAR - 9A6 Euromedex,
Mundolsheim) diluted 1/5000, to give the ratio SA/9α and
this ratio was then divided by the median ratio obtained in
control mice (ATRA alone).
For each synthetic peptide, 3 FVB/N mice were
immunized by one subcutaneous injection with 100µg of
peptide in 100 µl V/V phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/
Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA), and three injections
intraperitoneal one week, three weeks and 30 days
later with the same peptide without CFA (see protocol
illustrated on Figure 1C). Sera were collected before
immunization and four days after the last injection and
were tested by ELISA. 96-well ELISA microplates were
coated with diluted peptides (500 ng per wells) for 2hrs
at 37°C (dilution was performed in 50mM carbonate/
bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.5). For the antibodies generated
by pVAX14+ATRA, day 60 sera from mice (protocol
illustrated on Figure 1A) were used. After coating the
microplates were washed five times in PBS/0.05% Tween
20 and incubated 1h at room temperature with 50 µl per
well of PBS containing bovine serum albumin (BSA).
Microplates were washed five times (washes and dilution
were performed in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) and
incubated 90 min at 37°C with 50 µl serum 1:50 diluted
(each serum in triplicate). After washing, the microplates
were incubated 90 min with 50 µl per well of peroxidaseconjugated goat anti mouse immunoglobulin (Jackson)
diluted 1:20,000. The microplates were washed five times
and peroxidase activity was revealed by adding 100 µl
per well of either Sigmafast OPD for the sera generated
with peptides (optical density (OD) as a measure of Ig
production was measured using a Dynatech, MR5000
(Labsystem, Cergy, France) at a wavelength of 495 nm) or
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (BD Bioscience®) for the sera
generated by pVAX14+ATRA (OD was measured using a
Dynatech, MR5000 at a wavelength of 450 nm versus 550
nm). The reaction was stopped 3 to 20 min by addition of
25µl of 2.5N H2SO4 per well. The pVAX14+ATRA values
were normalized to the ATRA values by subtracting the
mean of 3 ATRA treated mice assayed in triplicate from
the mean of each sample of pVAX14+ATRA values
assayed in triplicate. For each of the 10 peptides covering
the 6 ORFs of pVAX14 SA was measured.

Peroxidase (SVa-HRP) and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole
(AEC) substrate (Becton Dickinson) followed by image
analysis. Irradiated (25 Gy) APL spleen cells (0.25x106
per 106 LN) or PML-RARA peptide (2 μmolar per 106
LN) [ASGAGEAAIETQSSS (15-mer)] were used to
stimulate effectors from treated APL mice as spontaneous
release was similar to healthy mice. Relative numbers
of IFNγ producing cells were calculated by subtracting
the unstimulated values from the stimulated numbers.
Spontaneous release of HR-MDS lymph node cells were
assayed without the need for stimulating as in a transgenic
model the transgenes continue to be expressed and the
lymph nodes were stimulated in vivo.

Measurement of memory T-cells (memT) by flow
cytometry
The determination of percentage of the homing
cell adhesion molecule (HCAM) or CD44hi/CD62Llo or
L-selectin population within the CD4+ as a measure of
memT was undertaken on peripheral blood (PB) of the
mice. The antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences
(Paris, France). Samples were measured using a BD FACS
Canto flow cytometer and at least 10,000 events were
collected from each sample. Data were processed using
the BD FACS Canto II Software.

CFU assay
A modified method previously described [17,49] to
assess the effects of CD3+ effectors on BM progenitors
were applied. Briefly, BM cells from diseased mice with
high percentage of blasts were used as targets. CD3+
enriched cells from the spleen of treated mice using CD3
magnetic beads from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany) were co-cultured with BM from normal FVB/N
or diseased mice. Colonies from APL BM were picked and
PML-RARA bearing cells were confirmed by PCR (data
not shown). The ratio of CD3+ effector cells (E) to BM
target (T) for culture in Methocult® media as recommended
by the manufacturer (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver,
Canada). This assay kit contained rm-Stem Cell Factor,
rmIL-3, rhIL-6 growth factors and insulin and transferrin.
Briefly 106 BM cells were centrifuged and resuspended
in 0.5 ml Iscove’s media supplemented with 2% heat
inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM glutamine, 5
UI/ml penicillin and 300 mg/ml streptomycin. 0.3 ml of
cells was added to 3 ml of Methocult® and 1 ml (2x104)
was plated per 35 mm dish (in triplicate). Cultures of BM
from diseased mice and enriched CD3+ spleen cells from
treated mice were plated at an effectors to target (E:T)
ratio of 2.5:1, 5:1 and 10:1 and incubated for 7 days at 37°
C, 5% CO2 in air and > 95% humidity. Identification and
counts of colonies on day 7 were done according to the
technical manual of the manufacturer. The optimal ratio

Interferon gamma (IFNγ) production
IFNγ producing cells were measured using an
Elispot kit according to the manufacuters’ instructions
(Becton Dickinson (BD, Berges, France). Briefly, lymph
nodes were harvested at different time points after the
DNA injections as indicated in Figure legends. Lymph
node cells (LN, 106) were incubated overnight in wells
coated with anti-IFNγ-antibody. Biotinylated anti-mouse
IFNγ (2 μg/ml) was used to detect the captured IFNγ.
Spots were visualized using Streptavidin-Horse Radish
