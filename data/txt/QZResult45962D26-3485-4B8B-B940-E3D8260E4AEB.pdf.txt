BACKGROUND: Marqibo, a sphingosomal/cholesterol encapsulation of vincristine sulfate has targeted,
increased, and sustained delivery of vincristine to tumor tissues. A phase 2, open-label, single-arm, and multinational study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of Marqibo as a single agent in patients with multiply
relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). METHODS: Eligible patients had relapsed or
refractory de novo or transformed aggressive NHL and prior treatment with at least 2 multiagent chemotherapy
regimens. Marqibo was administered at 2 mg/m2, every 2 weeks, for a maximum of 12 cycles or until toxicity or
disease progression. RESULTS: One hundred and nineteen patients were enrolled and treated on trial. Ninetysix had histological confirmed de novo (N ¼ 89) or transformed (N ¼ 7) aggressive NHL. Median number of
cycles was 4 (median dose/cycle 4 mg). Overall response (CR and complete response unconfirmed and PR)
was 25% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17, 35), CR and complete response unconfirmed confirmed by external
reviewers was 5%. Median overall survival was 6.6 months (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 95% CI, 4.7, 9.8). Grade 3
of 4 neurotoxicity occurred in 32% of patients. All patients had prior neurotoxic agents, and 85% had baseline
residual neuropathy symptoms (grades 1-2) from prior treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Marqibo is an active agent
in patients with heavily pretreated aggressive NHL, and tolerated at approximately twice the dose intensity
of standard vincristine. Its activity supports further investigation as a substitution for vincristine in combiC 2009 American Cancer Society.

50%-60% of patients diagnosed with aggressive NHL
will ultimately fail therapy and require palliation.1 Currently, there is no standard approach to patients who are
no longer candidates for curative strategies. New treatment approaches are needed.
Vincristine, a vinca alkaloid, interacts with tubulin
and leads to the disruption of microtubules comprising
the mitotic spindle apparatus, resulting in metaphase
arrest in dividing cells.2,3 The length of exposure is critical
to the efficacy of phase-specific agents such as vincristine.
The cytotoxicity of vincristine has been shown to be
related to both extracellular concentration and duration
of exposure.4 A novel formulation of vincristine encapsulated in a liposomal vesicle composed of sphingomyelin
and cholesterol (Marqibo, Hana Biosciences) was
designed with the goal of increasing time of exposure to
vincristine.5,6 Marqibo has extended plasma circulation
compared with free vincristine and passively targets vincristine to tumors by extravasation through the fenestrations that typify tumor neovasculature.5-7
In this report, we present the results of a phase 2,
open-label, single-arm, and multinational study performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Marqibo
as monotherapy in patients with multiply relapsed or
refractory aggressive NHL. These data indicate that
Marqibo is an active agent in these patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
One hundred nineteen patients from 42 centers were enrolled between May 2000 and September 2002. Adult
patients (defined as persons 18 years of age or older) were
considered for inclusion in this single-arm, open-label
study if they had histologically confirmed de novo or
transformed aggressive NHL as defined by the WHO.8
The following histologies were included in the definition
of aggressive NHL: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with
sclerosis, including primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, immunoblastic B-cell lymphoma, T-cell rich Bcell lymphoma, anaplastic large B-cell lymphoma; peripheral T-cell not otherwise specified; and anaplastic large
null-/T-cell lymphoma. Written informed consent was
obtained in all cases. Two independent pathologists retrospectively performed central pathology review on all
3476

patients. Eligible patients had to meet the following inclusion criteria: failed 2 or more previous combination chemotherapy regimens (at least 1 anthracycline-containing);
had at least a minimal response to first-line therapy;an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of less than or equal to 3; absolute neutrophil
count (ANC) greater than or equal to .5  109 /L and platelets of at least 50  109 /L (unless decreased because of
bone marrow involvement); total bilirubin less than 2
times upper limits of normal (ULN); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase less than or equal
to 4 times ULN; and at least 1 measurable lesion greater
than 2 cm in 1 dimension.
Major exclusion criteria were as follows: HIV-positive
serology; prior allogenic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation; radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy
or corticosteroids within 4 weeks of study enrollment;
active CNS lymphoma or AIDS-related lymphoma; neuromuscular impairment or grades 3 or 4 sensorimotor neuropathy related to previous chemotherapy.
Other exclusion criteria are as follows: patients
receiving therapy with phenytoin or drugs known to inhibit or induce hepatic drug metabolism by cytochrome
P450 isoenzymes in the CYP3A subfamily; patients with
any previous malignancies with less than a 5-year complete remission interval (except curatively resected basal
cell carcinoma or curatively resected in situ carcinoma of
the uterine cervix); patients with history of neurologic disorders unrelated to chemotherapy; major surgery within 4
weeks before enrollment; and patients who were pregnant
or lactating.

Treatment
Patients received Marqibo at 2 mg/m2 as an infusion over
1 hour, every 2 weeks. There was no dose capping.
Patients received up to 12 cycles of Marqibo in the absence of toxicity or progressive disease. Treatment did not
exceed 12 cycles unless it was determined that a patient
might obtain a benefit from continued treatment. Determination of potential patient benefit was based on the
consensus opinion of the Sponsor, Medical Monitor, and
the Investigator. Dose reductions for Marqibo-associated
grade 3 and grade 4 toxicities were carried out in .2 mg/
m2 decrements. A maximum of 3 10% dose reductions
were allowed.

Endpoints
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the objective response rate, defined as the percentage of patients
whose best response was complete response (CR), complete response unconfirmed, or partial response (PR). Secondary endpoints include duration of response and
overall survival time.
Evaluation of Response
Tumor assessments were made by imaging studies and
physical exams, performed at baseline (defined as within
3 weeks of initiation of treatment), after every 4 cycles
of treatment, and at 2, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after the last
cycle of Marqibo. The investigators determined patient
responses, and then an independent review panel reviewed
each case. The patient’s best response was determined by
the independent review panel according to International
Workshop Response Criteria.9 The independent review
panel members were blinded to investigator response evaluation. After completion of the study, patients were followed on an ongoing basis to document survival. The last
date of patient follow-up was June 24, 2004.

received the study drug and met all prospectively defined
inclusion criteria. Median duration of response (defined
as the time from the first documentation of response to
first documentation of relapse or progression) and overall
survival (defined as the time from the date of the first
study dose to the date of death) as well as their associated
95% CIs were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method,
respectively, for the ITT, aggressive NHL, and PP populations. Standard descriptive statistics were used to analyze
baseline demographics and disease characteristics and presented for both populations.
Safety analysis

All patients who received at least 1 dose of the study
drug were included in the safety analysis, which evaluated
the events that occurred from the initiation of the study
drug through 30 days after the discontinuation of study
drug. The severity of adverse events and laboratory abnormality was graded in accordance with the National Cancer
Institute toxicity criteria grading scale. In addition, the
Kaplan-Meier method was also used to estimate the median dose to grade 3 or 4 neuropathy.
Sample Size Determination

Statistical Methods
Efficacy analysis

The primary efficacy endpoint would be summarized as the proportion of patients who achieved overall
response (CR, complete response unconfirmed, or PR)
based on the independent review panel review in the
intention-to-treat (ITT) population. An exact 2-sided
95% confidence interval (CI) was to be constructed
around the estimated proportion. The ITT population
included all patients who received at least 1 dose of Marqibo (n ¼ 119). Of these, 96 had histologically de novo or
transformed aggressive NHL confirmed by the Central
Pathology Review and constituted the aggressive NHL
population. This histologic group was the primary group
of interest and for which the protocol was designed.
Patients without response data (missing data) would be
treated as failures to achieve overall responses.
As a secondary analysis, the overall response rate and
its 2-sided exact 95% CI would be summarized for the per
protocol (PP) and aggressive NHL population. The PP
population comprised histologically eligible patients who
Cancer

The study sample size was determined to ensure that
the half-width of the 95% CI to be less than 10% and
required a maximum of 100 patients. With a sample size
of 100 patients, the half-width of the 95% CI would be
no larger than 9.8% no matter what response rate is
observed. This is based on the finding that for a given confidence level, the maximum width of the CI occurs when
the response rate is 50%.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
One hundred and nineteen patients were enrolled and
treated with Marqibo. An independent central pathology
panel subsequently reviewed all cases, and 96 patients
(81%) were determined to have histologically eligible
large cell lymphoma de novo or transformed. Histologically ineligible patients (n ¼ 23) were predominantly
patients with follicular cell lymphoma or small cell lymphoma that did not meet the criteria for transformation
according to the reviewers. An additional 19 patients were

ineligible because they failed to meet all prospectively
defined inclusion criteria, and, thus, 77 patients met all
protocol criteria for eligibility. Patient ineligibility for
each criterion were not mutually exclusive and patients
were excluded for: inappropriate number of prior combination chemotherapy regimens (n ¼ 5); inappropriate
prior anthracycline based therapy (n ¼ 4); lack of minor
response to first chemotherapy regimen (n ¼ 3); disease
without at least 1 measurable lesion greater than 2 cm in 1
dimension (n ¼ 8); prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy,
immunotherapy, or alternative cancer treatment within 4
weeks before study entry (n ¼ 1); missing baseline; and at
least 1 postbaseline tumor assessment (n ¼ 6). Therefore,
77 histological eligible patients met all prospectively
defined inclusion criteria and are evaluable. These patients
comprised the per protocol (PP) population.
Patient characteristics at study entry are listed in Table 1 for all 3 populations defined above (ITT, aggressive
NHL, and PP). Similar baseline demographic and baseline disease characteristics were observed for the 3 populations. Patients had widespread disease with high tumor
burden at baseline. Forty-eight percent of the ITT population had advanced disease (high-intermediate to high
International Prognostic Index scores) at baseline. The
patients in this study had experienced multiple relapses
and had received extensive prior treatments with multidrug chemotherapeutic regimens (median of 3 prior lines
of treatments). Most patients had disease that was resistant
to their last treatment. Approximately one third of
patients relapsed after autologous stem cell transplantation. At baseline, 78% of patients were anemic, 40% had
thrombocytopenia, 15% had neutropenia, and 33% had
ANCs <1.5  109 /L or platelets <100  109 /L. In general, patients in this study had few treatment options
available and many were unable to tolerate further treatment with myelosuppressive drugs.

Tumor Response
The primary efficacy endpoint in this study was objective
response rate (Table 2). The objective response rate for
the ITT population was 25% (95% CI, 18, 34) and was
approximately 2.3-fold greater in patients with sensitive
disease (objective response rate ¼ 41% [95% CI, 26, 58])
compared with those who were resistant (objective
response rate ¼ 18% [95% CI, 10, 28]) to their last treat3478

ment regimen. The response by histology was as follows:
27% (24 of 89) for de novo large cell lymphoma; 0% (0
of 7) for transformed lymphoma, and 26% (6 of 23) for
indolent (follicular þ small lymphocytic) lymphoma.
Response rates were similar in all 3 populations
(ITT, aggressive NHL, and PP) in patients with sensitive
disease, compared with those who were resistant to their
last treatment regimen. Response rates also appeared to be
higher in patients that had received fewer previous treatment regimens in all groups. Objective response rate did
not differ based on age, sex, or prior autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) in the ITT population.

Response Duration
Based upon the independent review panel review, approximately 2 of 3 of patients did not have evidence of progression and their data were censored in the analysis at the last
contact. The reason the patients are censored is that they
proceeded to subsequent treatment, including additional
investigational drugs or stem cell transplantation. Thus,
the median duration of response cannot be adequately
assessed. However, at the time of the last documented
progression, which occurred at 85 days after initiation of
the study drug, the Kaplan-Meier estimate for the probability of remaining in response was 52%. This suggests
that the median duration of response is approximately 12
weeks, although this analysis is limited by the high proportion of responders that went on to other treatments.

Survival
All patients were followed for survival. As of the last survival update, 61% and 64% of the patients died in the
ITT population and PP population, respectively. The estimated median survivals were similar between the 2 populations: 6.9 months (95% CI, 4.8, 11.7) for the ITT
population and 6.6 months (95% CI, 4.8, 13.1) for PP
population, based on the Kaplan-Meier analysis (Fig. 1).
One-year overall survival rates were 33% and 61%,
respectively, for patients who had not and had achieved
overall response in the ITT population (Fig. 2). Patients
who had disease that was sensitive to the last qualifying
therapy had a median survival of 13.1 months, versus 5.1
months for patients with resistant disease in the ITT
population (Fig. 3).

Safety
All patients who received at least 1 study dose in this study
(n ¼ 119) are eligible for safety evaluation. The median
number of cycles received was 4 (range, 1, 20). Sixty-nine
(58%) patients received 4 or more cycles of therapy, including 11 (9%) patients who received 10 or more cycles of
Marqibo. The median total dose (as the sum of study dose
across all cycles) delivered was 7.9 mg/m2 (range, 1.9, 39.6).
No treatment-related deaths occurred on study.
Adverse events were typically grade 1 and 2. Treatment
withdrawal due to adverse events occurred in only 15% of
patients. Dose modifications occurred in 24% of patients,
and dose delays were required by 20% of patients. Of the
24 patients who had dose delays, 18 were discontinued

from treatment without receiving another dose of Marqibo. Treatment was discontinued because of progressive
disease in 8 patients and neuropathy in 7 patients. Neuropathy was the main reason for discontinuation or modification of Marqibo treatment. Common grade 3 and 4
adverse events are listed in Table 3.
Grade 3 neuropathy occurred in 29% of patients, all
of whom had baseline neuropathy grade 2. Grade 4 neuropathy was seen only in 3% of patients, and they also had
grade 2 neuropathy at baseline. In general, patients on
trial experienced neurotoxicity that was characterized as 1
grade worse than their baseline assessment. The projected
median cumulative dose of Marqibo resulting in grade 3
of 4 neurotoxicity was 21 mg/m2 (95% CI, 10, 31), which

equates to approximately 11 cycles of Marqibo. Most
patients who responded to Marqibo showed clinically evident tumor responses after 1 dose of Marqibo.
The incidence of grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicity
is noted in Table 3. Grade 4 neutropenia was seen in 9
patients who at baseline are normal (6 pts) and already
had grade 1 (2 pts) and grade 3 (1 pt) neutropenia. Bone
marrow involvement at baseline and prior ABMT
increased the risk of developing myelosuppression. The
use of hematologic growth factor and transfusion support
while receiving Marqibo was less than 22% (filgrastim
13%, erythropoietin 22%, transfusions 19%). Febrile
neutropenia was reported in 3% of patients.

DISCUSSION
Marqibo is the encapsulation of vincristine in lipid vesicles
composed of sphingomyelin and cholesterol called optisomes.5 It is the unique composition of optisomes that allows
them to effectively contain lipophilic drugs like vincristine. In
preclinical studies, Marqibo provided a targeted, increased,
and sustained delivery of vincristine to tumor tissue.5,6 This
delivery resulted in prolonged availability and activity of vincristine and greater anticancer properties than free vincristine
in preclinical solid tumor and lymphoma models.
The results of this study indicate that single-agent
Marqibo is an active agent in patients with relapsed or
refractory aggressive NHL. An objective response rate of
25% was observed in this study population that comprised
heavily pretreated patients with few therapeutic options and
with multiply relapsed or refractory disease. Moreover, 5%

of patients receiving Marqibo had complete responses (CR
and complete response unconfirmed). Greater objective
response rate was observed in patients with sensitive disease.
Patients with sensitive disease had an approximately 3-fold
greater objective response rate than those who were refractory or resistant to their last qualifying therapy.
When Marqibo was administered at approximately
twice the dose intensity of standard free vincristine (2 mg/
m2 over 1 hour every 2 weeks with no upper dose limit),
patients in this study exhibited a similar toxicity profile to
standard vincristine.2,10 Neurotoxicity was the most common adverse event, with severe (grade 3 or 4) neurotoxicity noted in only 32% of patients. The projected median
cumulative dose of Marqibo resulting in grade 3 of 4
neurotoxicity, however, was 21 mg/m2 (95% CI, 10, 31),
which equates to approximately 11 cycles of Marqibo.
Marqibo thus has a good tolerance profile, given that all
patients had prior exposure to neurotoxic drugs (eg, vincristine), that 85% of patients at study entry had residual
3481

Original Article

neurologic abnormalities from their prior treatments, and
that Marqibo was administered without dose limitation. In
fact, 86% of patients had received between 2 and 5 prior
chemotherapy regimens containing known neurotoxins.
Constipation was commensurate with vincristine exposure
and was clinically managed with stool softeners. Severe myelotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and alopecia were rare.
This phase 2 trial used a rigorous external review
design and a larger number of patients than other studies
of single-agent therapies in patients with aggressive
NHL.1 The use of an independent review panel in this
unblinded single-arm study provided an objective assessment of response9 and alleviated any potential investigator
bias. The independent review panel also ensured that
response criteria were consistently applied in the individual institutions in this multicenter trial. In all cases, the
concordance between independent review panel and investigator observations was excellent (>85%).
To address the complex histology of aggressive
NHL and variability between study sites, a retrospective
central pathology review of patient histological diagnoses
was performed.
Investigators determined histological eligibility for
entry into the study based upon review of patient pathology reports on site. All cases were subsequently reviewed
by 1 of 2 independent pathologists after patient enrollment in the study. The rate of histologic eligibility (81%)
reflects the complex histology of aggressive NHL.
This study demonstrates clinically relevant activity of
Marqibo in patients with relapsed aggressive NHL and with
poor prognoses. Furthermore, Marqibo has a safety profile
comparable to free vincristine when administered at approximately twice the dose intensity. Although it remains to be
seen what effect Marqibo will have in other types of cancers
and in combination with other agents, data suggest that
objective response rate greater than 95% are achieved when
Marqibo is used in CHOP and R-CHOP regimens in place
of generic vincristine in previously untreated patients with
aggressive NHL.11-13 Overall the data suggest that Marqibo
has potential as a nonmyelosuppressive option in patients
with aggressive NHL for whom other therapeutic options
have been exhausted.
