ABSTRACT
Nanoemulsions have been widely applied to dermal and transdermal drug delivery.
However, whether and to what depth the integral nanoemulsions can permeate into
the skin is not fully understood. In this study, an environment-responsive dye, P4, was
loaded into nanoemulsions to track the transdermal translocation of the nanocarriers,
while coumarin-6 was embedded to represent the cargoes. Particle size has great
effects on the transdermal transportation of nanoemulsions. Integral nanoemulsions
with particle size of 80 nm can diffuse into but not penetrate the viable epidermis.
Instead, these nanoemulsions can efficiently fill the whole hair follicle canals and
reach as deep as 588 μm underneath the dermal surfaces. The cargos are released
from the nanoemulsions and diffuse into the surrounding dermal tissues. On the
contrary, big nanoemulsions, with mean particle size of 500 nm, cannot penetrate the
stratum corneum and can only migrate along the hair follicle canals. Nanoemulsions
with median size, e.g. 200 nm, show moderate transdermal permeation effects among
the three-size nanoemulsions. In addition, colocalization between nanoemulsions and
immunofluorescence labeled antigen-presenting cells was observed in the epidermis
and the hair follicles, implying possible capture of nanoemulsions by these cells. In
conclusion, nanoemulsions are advantageous for transdermal delivery and potential
in transcutaneous immunization.

INTRODUCTION

to emerging of a series of passive and active strategies.
The passive strategies employ penetration enhancers [79], nanocarriers [10-13] and prodrugs [14, 15] to improve
dermal permeation, whilst the active strategies damage the
SC barriers using physical tools, such as tape stripping,
microneedles, iontophoresis, electroporation, sonophoresis
and jet injection [2, 16]. Considering the availability of
instruments and patient compliance, nanocarriers are
preferable to the physical tools.
Besides delivery of chemical drugs, skin has
been increasingly realized as an outstanding route to

Skin is an attractive route for both local and
systemic delivery of drugs [1-4]. However, the stratum
corneum (SC), a ‘bricks and mortar’ structure, prevents
entry of harmful xenobiotics as well as most therapeutic
compounds into the body [5]. The lipophilic and intact
SC layers allow only small (< 500 Da) and moderately
lipophilic molecules (logP 1-3) to diffuse through
passively [6]. Irrespective of dermal or transdermal
delivery, it is essential to overcome the SC barriers, leading

stimulate robust immunity [17]. Because of continuous
exposure to external pathogens, skin develops competent
immune systems to elicit immune responses in case the
physical barrier is damaged due to nicks and cuts. Both
Langerhans cells that reside in the viable epidermis and
dendritic cells that locate in the dermal layer are potent
antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which capture and
present pathogen-derived antigens to induce adaptive
immune responses [17-19]. Due to the dense population
of APCs in the skin, transcutaneous immunization (TCI)
is endowed with superior immunogenicity as well as
analgesia compared with systemic and intramuscular
immunization [20]. Similarly, overcoming the SC barriers
is full of challenges, especially for biomacromolecules
such as vaccines. Polymeric nanoparticles were recently
applied to encapsulate immunologic active materials for
TCI [21-25]. However, due to poor dermal permeation into
the rigid structure, tape stripping or iontophoresis should
be combined to facilitate transdermal delivery [21-23,
26]. Besides, adjuvants are necessary to be combined with
nanoparticles to generate efficient immune responses [24].
Nanoemulsions are aqueous dispersed ultrafine oil
droplets stabilized by surfactants and co-surfactants, with
a normal size less than 500 nm [27]. It should be noted that
nanoemulsions are different to microemulsions, because
the latter are referred to thermodynamically stable isotropic
liquids formed by mixing oil, water, and surfactants
together [28]. Due to the fluidic microstructure, high
solubilizing capacity for lipophilic drugs and excellent
skin affinity, nanoemulsions show superior transdermal
efficiency to rigid nanoparticles [3, 29]. In addition, the
compositions of nanoemulsions, i.e. oils, surfactants
and co-surfactants, are frequently applied as penetration
enhancers, improving skin permeability by altering lipid
structure and fluidity of SC [30, 31]. Several topical
preparations based on nanoemulsions have been approved
for clinical use, e.g. Estrasorb® (estradiol), Flexogan®
(methy salicylate), Oxalgin nanogel® (diclofenac sodium)
and Ameluz® (5-amino levulinic acid). Nanoemulsions
were utilized as antigen and immunopotentiator carrier for
TCI recently [32]. However, in vivo fate of nanoemulsions
post dermal administration has not been fully understood.
A fundamental issue is whether the integral nanoemulsions
can permeate into and across the skin barriers [33]. In
other words, if the nanoemulsion components along can
enhance the transdermal delivery, what is the significance
of the nanoemulsion structure? Furthermore, a key issue
in TCI is whether, and to what extent, these nanocarriers
can penetrate into the skin and deliver vaccines to APCs.
However, a literature search always gives paradoxical
findings. Some studies attribute enhanced dermal
permeation to the penetration of integral nanoemulsions
into the depth of the skin via intercellular as well as
intracellular routes [34-36]. Others believe that the
encapsulated drugs are released from the nanoemulsions
and diffuse through the SC, while the compositions of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

nanoemulsions decreased the SC barriers by extracting
the SC lipids as well as denaturing the proteins of
keratinocytes [37-39].
This difficult situation owes much to the lack of
functional approaches to identify nanoparticles against
the physiological background due to the small size of
the nanocarriers. Electron microscopy observation and
fluorescence-based imaging are adopted to fulfil this
purpose [40]. Due to similarity in compositions, it is
basically impossible to discriminate nanoemulsions
from dermal lipids. Although fluorescence labelling
provides important information on the dermal penetration
of nanoemulsions [29, 34-36, 41], the images merely
demonstrate the distribution of the label which may
diffuse out of the nanoemulsions while moving through
the skin [33]. Furthermore, dermatopharmacokinetic
analysis of the nanoemulsion components across the skin
depth was adopted to answer the question [33]. However,
to our best knowledge, there are still no direct evidences
indicating the penetration of nanoemulsions into the skin
depth. Environment-responsive probes provide excellent
opportunities to discriminate the nanocarriers from signals
of free probes in vivo [40].
Recently, our group developed a series of nearinfrared (NIR) fluorescent probes with a BODIPY or
aza-BODIPY structure to track the in vivo fate of integral
nanoparticles [42-44]. The distinct feature of these
probes is the sensitive aggregation-caused quenching
(ACQ) effects upon contact with water through π-π
stacking. These probes are highly hydrophobic and thus
can be tightly embedded into either lipid or polymeric
nanoparticles, where they emit intense fluorescence
signals when being well dispersed. On the contrary, the
fluorescence quenches immediately upon release from
nanoparticles due to degradation of the matrix. These
probes also display typical characteristics of the BODIPY
family, e.g. high quantum yields, superior stability and pH
insensitivity, which enable themselves to survive the harsh
in vivo environments. In addition, since water is ubiquitous
in the whole body, this on/off signal switching provides
accurate and sensitive signaling to track nanoparticles
throughout the whole body [40]. This rationale is also
applicable to dermal conditions. Due to the ability of the
skin to control water loss, water content equals to 75%
of the epidermis, while even the comparatively dry SC
contains 15% water [45]. The occlusive effects from the
nanoemulsion film on the surface can further improve the
skin hydration [46].
In this study, the dermal penetration features of
nanoemulsions with particle size of 80 (NE-80), 200
(NE-200) and 500 (NE-500) nm are studied, respectively,
by adopting the ACQ probe, P4 (Supplementary
Figure 1), to track their in vivo behaviours. DAPI and
immunofluorescence were used to stain normal cells
and APCs for confocal laser scanning microscope
(CLSM) observation, respectively. Specific attention is

prepared, respectively (Figure 1A, 1B and 1C). The PDIs
are all less than 0.25, indicating a narrow size distribution.
As observed by TEM, all of the nanoemulsions are
spherical with smooth surfaces (Figure 1A, 1B and 1C).
The observed particle sizes are coincident with the results
measured by Zetasizer.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Preparation of nanoemulsions

Since it is accepted that particle size plays a key role
in in vivo performance of nanoparticles, nanoemulsions
with mean particle size of 80, 200 and 500 nm were

The stability of the nanoemulsions in different

irrespective of the particle size of the nanoemulsions
and the type of the medium (Supplementary Figure 2),
indicating negligible leakage of the loaded P4 probe.
The reason for this is mainly attributed to the high
hydrophobicity of P4 molecules. Besides, the particle
size of NE-80 and NE-200 is kept unchanged during the
incubation of 48 h (Supplementary Figure 2). But due to
the larger size of NE-500, variation on particle size of NE500 during incubation is a little bit higher than the smaller
ones (Supplementary Figure 2).

Figure 3). Since SC is full of lipids and P4 molecule is
highly hydrophobic, the rekindling of the fluorescence is
mainly ascribed to the dissolve of P4 in the lipids of SC.
Thus the fluorescence only appeared in the layer of the SC.
This indicates the rationality of using ACQ probes, e.g.
P4, to track the transdermal delivery of nanoemulsions.

Vertical sections
As observed from the vertical sections, none of
the nanoemulsions could efficiently penetrate across the
intact skin (Figure 2). The red fluorescence of NE-500
only appeared on the surface of the viable epidermis
during the whole experimental period, indicating that
NE-500 cannot penetrate the SC (Figure 2). Even though,
the fluorescence intensity is faint, which may be ascribed
to the poor permeability of larger nanoemulsions.
However, although being retained in the SC in the first
4 h post administration, NE-80 started to permeate into
the viable epidermis from 8 h post administration (Figure
2). Nonetheless, NE-80 cannot permeate into the dermis
all along. At 36 h post administration, only a diffusion
gradient can be observed in the viable epidermis (Figure

In vivo transdermal penetration
To visualize the overall transdermal translocation of
nanoemulsions, DAPI was used to stain nucleus of dermal
cells. It should be noted that the outermost edge of the
stained tissue represents the viable epidermis instead of
the SC, because SC is composed of dead cells without
nucleus. During the whole experimental period, almost no
fluorescence signals can be observed from skin samples
treated by P4 quenched solution except that only faint
fluorescence signals were observed on the surface of the
viable epidermis, e.g. the SC, at 36 h (Supplementary

slides were stained with DAPI.

2), indicating that the amount of nanoemulsions that enter
into the viable epidermis is still limited. It is suggested
that nanoemulsions are disintegrating upon penetrating
through the SC, while the components penetrate the
SC with different extents and rates [33, 47]. Since the
components may increase the fluidity of the SC lipids,
they facilitate dermal permeation [48]. Therefore, up to 8
h post administration, small amount of NE-80 that survive
the SC start to enter into the viable epidermis. However,
at 48 h post administration, the fluorescent intensity
in the viable epidermis is reduced to negligible levels
due to degradation and/or absorption of the penetrated
nanoemulsions; and the fluorescence is mainly found
on the surface of the viable epidermis. The transdermal
efficiency of NE-200 is at the average level among the
three nanoemulsions. NE-200 enter into the viable
epidermis at 36 h post administration, as indicated by
the weak P4 fluorescence (Figure 2). But the colocalized
regions present blue fluorescence as observed in the
merged channel, indicating that the permeated amount of
NE-200 is very limited.
In comparison with the poor penetration across
epidermis, it is easier for nanoemulsions to enter into
the hair follicles (Figure 2). NE-80 was found filling
the whole hair follicles from the openings to the roots,
indicating excellent trans-follicular permeation. On the
contrary, NE-500 cannot efficiently permeate into the
whole hair follicles, but migrate along the hair follicles
to the deeper site along with time (Figure 2). At the first
24 h of the experiment, the fluorescence signals can only
be observed in the upper parts of the hair follicles. Until

36 h, NE-500 permeate into the whole hair follicles,
while the nanoemulsions are found depositing in the root
of the hair follicles at 48 h. Since the nanoemulsions are
not monodispersed, the trans-follicular transportation is
mainly ascribed to the small size population in NE-500.
Coumarin 6 (C6), emitting green fluorescence, was
used to mimic the cargos delivered by the nanoemulsions
which emits red fluorescence. Therefore, the distribution
of the green fluorescence is the same with that of the
nanoemulsions. But interestingly, the penetration
depth of the green fluorescence is deeper than the red
fluorescence, which is ascribed to the release of C6 from
nanoemulsions and the diffusion of the C6 molecules.
And the components of the nanoemulsions facilitate the
diffusion [47]. It should be noted that the thermodynamic
activity of the cargos in the nanoemulsions is the driving
force for the release and penetration of the molecules
into the skin [49]. The thermodynamic activity varies in
accordance with the physicochemical properties of the
cargo molecules. Results from C6 cannot be expanded to
all drug molecules. In this regard, nanoemulsions may be
advantageous for treatment of dermal diseases instead of
systemic diseases that require transdermal delivery.

Horizontal sections
In order to further characterize the penetration depth
of the nanoemulsions, continuous horizontal sections of
skin samples 24 h (Figure 3) and 48 h (Supplementary
Figure 4) post administration were performed,

respectively. The results obtained from the horizontal
sections corroborate that from the vertical sections.
Ideally, the skin samples shall be flat and parallel to the
section plane. But they provided curved surfaces actually.
Therefore, fluorescence signals observed in the first slide
of NE-80 treated skin samples present like contour lines,
instead of a plane. Due to the same reason, fluorescence
“contour lines” can be seen in the edge of some slides at
deeper locations, which actually come from the viable
epidermis. In addition, the fluorescent signals are scattered
as circles in the subsequent slides of deeper sites instead
of contiguous. The fluorescent areas are attributed to the
hair follicles, indicating that the nanoemulsions cannot
penetrate across the whole skin tissues but through the
hair follicles. Nonetheless, the trans-follicular permeation
of NE-80 is superior to both NE-200 and NE-500. NE-80
can reach the depth of 588 μm below the surface of the
skin, whereas the other two can only reach the maximum
of 504 μm. Besides, as observed in the slides of 48 h, both
NE-200 and NE-500 deposited in segments instead of the
whole hair follicle (Supplementary Figure 4).

The vertical sections of skins treated by
nanoemulsions post administration are observed using
CLSM under magnification folds of 20 × (Figure 5 and
Supplementary Figure 5). APCs mainly reside among
the keratinocytes and the peri-follicular sites. Therefore,
these areas are stained as blue. It should be noted that the
circular blue regions in the slides are attributed to the hair
follicles. Since NE-80 is superior in dermal permeation,
the red, green and blue signals overlap in these areas and
show pinkish blue. It is also observed that the pinkish
blue colour deepens gradually along with time and turns
into deep blue at around 8 - 24 h (Figure 5). An intact
hair follicle is captured in the slide of 12 h, which is full
of red fluorescence of NE-80 (Figure 5). However, only
the peri-follicular sites are stained to pinkish blue. All
of these results indicate that NE-80 may be taken up by
APCs that reside in the keratinocytes layer and the perifollicular sites. On the contrary, almost no co-localization
sites are found between NE-200/NE-500 and the APCs
both in the keratinocytes layer and the peri-follicular
sites (Supplementary Figure 5). Although the small size
population in NE-200/NE-500 do penetrate into the hair
follicles, the amount is very limited. Thus, even if the
penetrated nanoemulsions were captured by the perifollicular APCs, the colour change is negligible.

TCI by nanoemulsions
Besides delivery of chemical drugs, nanoemulsions
that penetrate into the viable epidermis and accumulate
in hair follicles may be potent for TCI due to capture
by APCs (Figure 4). Epidermis contains keratinocytes
and Langerhans cells. Keratinocytes play a major
immunological role as well by producing cytokins,
chemokines and antimicrobial peptides in response to
challenges [50]. They also belong to APCs. Langerhans
cells comprise 1-3% of epidermis cells though, they cover
nearly 20-25 % of the surface area due to the meshwork
structure [17, 51], allowing them to uptake antigens that
they encounter. The trans-follicular route has long been
negligible, because hair follicles cover only 0.1% of the
skin surface. However, the hair follicle is a promising
target for TCI without compromising the skin barrier [21],
which was firstly proved by the differences between hairy
and nude mice on immune response to topical application
of DNA vaccines [52]. The hair follicle provides both a
rich pool of peri-follicular APCs and a permeable sites due
to the absence of a SC barrier in the lower follicular orifice,
facilitating antigen uptake (Figure 4) [20]. Recently,
polymeric nanoparticles, smaller than 200 nm, have been
found penetrating into the hair follicles and being captured
by peri-follicular APCs [21-24]. But the skin should be
pretreated with cyanoacrylate stripping to reduce the
barrier due to the poor skin penetration of polymeric
nanoparticles. Similarly, nanoemulsions that reside in
epidermis and peri-follicular sites may be captured by
APCs and are potent for TCI (Figure 4). Therefore, APCs
are labeled by immunofluorescence staining to evaluate
the potential interaction with nanoemulsions.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Horizontal sections
Similarly, continuous horizontal sections on
skin samples 24 h (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure
6) post administration were performed. Still, the red
fluorescence observed in the slides is scattered in circular
regions (Figure 6), indicating that the nanoemulsions
enter into the skin mainly by trans-follicular route instead
of trans-epidermal route. Faint green signals can also
be found in the surrounding areas outside the circular
regions, because of the diffusion of C6 molecules that
are released from the nanoemulsions. Nonetheless, NE80 show superior trans-follicular efficiency to NE-200/
NE-500. NE-80 show stronger fluorescence intensity
than the other two nanoemulsions with deeper penetration
depth to 588 μm (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure
6). Moreover, the edge of the hair follicles are stained
by pink blue as observed in the merged channel for skin
samples treated by NE-80, implying the possible capture
of nanoemulsions by the peri-follicular APCs. However,
concerning the NE-200/NE-500 treated skin samples,
the red fluorescent signals from the nanoemulsions are
mainly surrounded by the blue signals from the perifollicular APCs (Supplementary Figure 6). The reason for
this phenomenon is primarily ascribed to the less amount
of NE-200/NE-500 accumulated in the hair follicles.
Although the nanoemulsions can be captured by the peri38220

follicular APCs, it cannot lead to obvious colour change
in the merged channel.
In summary, the ACQ probe, P4, can be used to
track the transdermal translocation of nanoemulsions.
Nanoemulsions can diffuse into but not efficiently
penetrate the viable epidermis. The trans-follicular route
is the primary route that nanoemulsions permeate into
the deep sites of the skin. The cargos can be released
from the nanoemulsions and diffuse into the surrounding
dermal tissues where nanoemulsions reside. Particle size
plays a significant role in the dermal translocation of
nanoemulsions. Small nanoemulsions, such as 80 nm,
can permeate into the viable epidermis as well as fill in
the whole hair follicles, whereas bigger nanoemulsions,
such as 500 nm, cannot efficiently penetrate the SC and
only migrate along the hair follicles. Nanoemulsions with
median size, such as 200 nm, exhibit moderate transdermal
delivery effects among the three-size nanoemulsions.
Furthermore, co-localization between nanoemulsions
and APCs in the viable epidermis and peri-follicular sites
implies possible capture of nanoemulsions by APCs.
In conclusion, nanoemulsions, especially smaller than
200 nm, are advantageous for dermal drug delivery and
potential in transcutaneous immunization.

dichloromethane to form the oil phase. The aqueous phase
was a solution of Kolliphor® HS 15 (3.0 g dissolved in
35 mL water). Under magnetic stirring, the oil phase was
instilled into the aqueous phase and mixed for 10 min.
The mixture was emulsified by high-speed shearing
(Scientz Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) under 10000
rpm for 10 s to form the crude emulsion. The crude
emulsion was subjected to different processes to obtain
nanoemulsions of different particle sizes. Nanoemulsions
of 80 nm (NE-80) and 200 nm (NE-200) were prepared
by homogenization (AH 100 D; ATS Engineering Inc,
Brampton, ON, Canada) under 1000 bar for 3 min and 120
bar for 2 min, respectively. Membrane emulsifier (Senhui
Microsphere Technology (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., China) was
used to prepare nanoemulsions of 500 nm (NE-500) by
sequentially extruding the crude emulsions through a
membrane tube with a pore size of 1.2 μm at 1.6 MPa for
4 cycles and 0.8 μm at 1.8 MPa for 2 cycles.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The mean particle size and polydispersity index
(PDI) of nanoemulsions were measured using a Malvern
Zetasizer Nano® (Malvern Instruments, Malvern UK) with
a 4 mW He-Ne laser at 633 nm under ambient temperature.
Prior to the measurement, the samples were diluted by 10
folds using Milli-Q water and balanced for 120 s in the
instrument. Triplicate measurements were performed for
each sample.

The fluorescent intensity was measured by Cary Eclipse
spectofluorometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc. US) at
an excitation wavelength of 651 nm and an emission
wavelength of 662 nm.

The process to the slide in immunofluorescence
staining is the same as DAPI staining, except that the
slide was put in citrate buffer solution at 95 °C for 20
min, following removal of PFA. After three washes in
pH 7.4 PBS, the slide was mounted with donkey serum
and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Following
removal of the serum with three washes in pH 7.4 PBS,
the slide was incubated with 0.5% Tween-20 solution for

The experiments were approved by the institutional
ethical committee and performed in compliance with the
institutional guidelines at School of Pharmacy, Fudan
University. SD rats (Male, 180-200 g) were raised in
rooms controlled at 23 ± 1°C and 55 ± 5% relative
humidity as well as 12 h light/12 h dark time cycles.
Standard laboratory chow diet and tap water were

We thank Mr. Chuguang Zhang at Shanghai
Dermatology Hospital for help with section.

The skins were split into four equal blocks.
The skins were embedded in the OCT compound.
Both horizontal and vertical cryosections of 7 μm
were performed. For vertical section, cutting was
performed from dermis towards SC to avoid artefacts
of nanoemulsions translocation. Continuous horizontal
sections were performed, starting from SC, one slice out of
every 12 sections was collected. These slices were further
subjected to either DAPI or immunofluorescence staining.

GRANT SUPPORT
This study was financially supported by National
Natural Science Foundation of China (81573363,
81690263 and 21372063), Shanghai Commission of
Science and Technology (14JC1490300) and Natural
Science Foundation of Shanghai (16ZR1403500).

DAPI staining
The slides were rinsed sequentially with pure water
twice (5 min each) and pH 7.4 PBS thrice (5 min each).
PFA, 4 %, was instilled on the surface of the slide and
incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After this, PFA
was removed by washing with pH 7.4 PBS. Then the slide
was stained by DAPI solution, 5 μg/mL, for 20 min. After
removal of DAPI, the slide was mounted by buffered
glycerol.
