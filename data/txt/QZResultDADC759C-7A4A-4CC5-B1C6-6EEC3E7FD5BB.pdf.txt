ABSTRACT
Background: Multi-drug resistance (MDR) remains a significant obstacle to
successful chemotherapy treatment for osteosarcoma patients. One of the central
causes of MDR is the overexpression of the membrane bound drug transporter
protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is the protein product of the MDR gene ABCB1.
Though several methods have been reported to reverse MDR in vitro and in vivo when
combined with anticancer drugs, they have yet to be proven useful in the clinical
setting.
Results: The meta-analysis demonstrated that a high level of P-gp may predict poor
survival in patients with osteosarcoma. The expression of P-gp can be efficiently blocked
by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated
Cas9 system (CRISPR-Cas9). Inhibition of ABCB1 was associated with reversing drug
resistance in osteosarcoma MDR cell lines (KHOSR2 and U-2OSR2) to doxorubicin.
Materials and Methods: We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the
relationship between P-gp expression and survival in patients with osteosarcoma.
Then we adopted the CRISPR-Cas9, a robust and highly efficient novel genome editing
tool, to determine its effect on reversing drug resistance by targeting endogenous
ABCB1 gene at the DNA level in osteosarcoma MDR cell lines.
Conclusion: These results suggest that the CRISPR-Cas9 system is a useful tool
for the modification of ABCB1 gene, and may be useful in extending the long-term
efficacy of chemotherapy by overcoming P-gp-mediated MDR in the clinical setting.

cases are either resistant to chemotherapy or acquire
resistance during treatment [5].
Overcoming drug resistance is one approach to
improving the survival rate of osteosarcoma patients
[6]. The development of drug resistance is associated
with multiple mechanisms. One of the major causes of
multi-drug resistance (MDR) is the overexpression of the
membrane bound drug transporter protein P-glycoprotein
(P-gp) [7, 8]. P-gp is the protein product of the MDR gene
ABCB1 (ABC subfamily B member 1, also know as MDR1) and acts as an energy-dependent drug efflux pump
that requires two ATPs to pump out many structurally
unrelated chemotherapeutic drugs [8]. A direct correlation
between P-gp expression levels and the degree of drug

INTRODUCTION
Osteosarcoma is one of the most common malignant
tumors of bone, which mainly affects children and
adolescents [1]. Current treatment for osteosarcoma
involves surgical resection and multi-agent chemotherapy
[1]. The advancement in intensive chemotherapy has
significantly improved the 5-year survival rate from
20% with surgery alone to approximately 60-70% when
combined with chemotherapy [2]. However, systemic
relapses still occur in 40% of patients, which are mostly
linked to chemotherapy drug resistance [3]. Increasing
drug dosage in histologically poor responders has not
improved their outcome [4]. Nearly 50% of osteosarcoma

resistance has been established in osteosarcoma cell
lines [7, 9]. Several studies have tried to investigate the
relevance of P-gp expression in osteosarcoma progression,
but the results remain controversial [10-21]. For example,
a previous study showed there was no correlation between
MDR1 mRNA expression and disease progression in
patients with osteosarcom [10]. However, another study
found positive immuno-staining for P-gp is an independent
risk factor for a poor outcome of osteosracoma patients
[21]. In our previous study, we also found expression of
P-gp is significantly predictor in patients with stage IIB
osteosarcoma [17]. These data suggest that further study is
required to clarify the prognostic value of P-gp expression
in osteosarcoma. Meta-analysis uses a statistical approach
that systematically combines the results from previous
multiple research studies to obtain a conclusion [22].
Strategies for reversing and preventing MDR
by targeting ABCB1 have been studied extensively in
different MDR model systems, including in osteosarcoma,
but have shown limited clinical potential [7-9]. A possible
approach to circumvent MDR is the co-administration of
inhibitors/compounds that inhibit the transport activity
of MDR transporters [7, 9, 23]. Four generations of P-gp
inhibitors have been developed [24], including verapamil,
cyclosporine A (CsA), reserpine, dexverapamil, PSC883, VX710, XR9576 (tariquidar), R101933 (laniquidar),
flavonoids, and a natural product, curcumin [25]. Other
substances, such as a new synthetic rifampicin derivative,
DiBenzRif, have recently been described to limit P-gp
ATPase activity by enhancing membrane fluidity at subtoxic concentrations and consequently inhibiting the
pump [26]. Our previous studies have demonstrated that
the small molecular compound NSC23925 could reverse
P-gp-mediated MDR in ovarian cancer by stimulating
P-gp ATPase activity [27]. Furthermore, we evaluated the
effects of NSC23925 on preventing the development of
MDR in osteosarcoma and in ovarian cancer. Our studies
noted that NSC23925 may prevent the development of
MDR by specifically inhibiting the overexpression P-gp in
both osteosarcoma and ovarian cancer [7, 28]. In addition,
we confirmed that the small molecule inhibitors A-770041
and NSC77037 may function to reverse P-gp-mediated
chemotherapy drug resistance [23, 29]. Though these
inhibitors have been reported to reverse MDR in vitro and
in vivo when combined with anticancer drugs, they have
yet to be proven useful in the clinical setting.
Recently, the CRISPR-Cas9 system, a novel genome
editing tool, has been implemented in a multitude of model
organisms and cell types [30]. The CRISPR-Cas9 system
uses Cas9, which complexes with single guided RNA
(sgRNA), to cleave DNA 3-4 base pairs upstream of a
protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) and generate doublestrand breaks (DSBs) in a sequence-specific manner [30].
The DSBs are then repaired either by non-homologous
end joining (NHEJ)-mediated error-prone DNA repair
or homologous directed repair (HDR)-mediated errorwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

free DNA repair [30]. The former repair can generate
small insertion and deletion mutations at the target sites.
These mutations can disrupt and abolish the function of
target genes or genomic elements. HDR-mediated errorfree DNA repair requires a homology-containing donor
DNA sequence as the repair template, which leads to
precise gene correction or replacement [30]. It is evident
that the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology has
revolutionized the field of genetic engineering and holds
the potential to overcome many of the limitations of earlier
techniques to carry out deletions, insertions, translocations,
and inversions at specific sites in the DNA of cells [30].
Due to the controversial discussions on the
relevance of P-gp expression in osteosarcoma, in this
study, we first explore the correlation between P-gp
expression and osteosarcoma prognosis through a metaanalysis of published case-control studies. Then, we
adopted the CRISPR-Cas9 system to specifically inhibit
ABCB1 at the DNA level in osteosarcoma MDR cells,
and further determined the effects of ABCB1 knockout
on reversing drug resistance in osteosarcoma MDR cells.

RESULTS
Results of meta-analysis
Eligible studies
A total of 707 studies were identified after
searching in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science for
publications on prognostic role of P-gp expression in
osteosarcoma. The titles, publication types and abstracts
were initially evaluated and the full texts were further
reviewed. Finally, 11 studies that met the inclusion
criteria were considered qualified for the present metaanalysis. Figure 1 showed the flow diagram of candidate
study selection in our study.
Characteristics of included studies
We collected the essential Data from the enrolled 11
studies which were conducted between 1995 and 2016. A
total of 723 participants from different territories involving
the United States, Dermark, Italy, Korea, Japan and Canada.
The sample size of the included study ranged from 19 to
149 patients. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was widely
applied to detect the expression of P-gp. Included studies
in this meta-analysis referred to evaluate P-gp expression
for prognostic outcome in osteosarcoma. The main features
of these 11 studies were summarized in Table 1.

inhibits P-gp expression

Publication bias

The CRISPR-Cas9 and green fluorescent protein
(GFP) fusion protein expression vector U6gRNACas9+2A-GFP guide by ABCB1 sgRNA was abbreviated
as ABCB1-Cas9-GFP (Figure 3). To determine the
transfection efficiency of ABCB1-Cas9-GFP or pEGFP-N3
plasmids into KHOSR2 and U-2OSR2 cells, fluorescence
expression was evaluated by a fluorescence microscope.
As illustrated in Figure 4A, GFP was detected in
KHOSR2-pEGFP-N3,
KHOSR2-ABCB1-Cas9-GFP,
U-2OSR2-pEGFP-N3, and U-2OSR2-ABCB1-Cas9-GFP
cells, which suggested that KHOSR2 and U-2OSR2 cells
were successfully transfected with ABCB1-Cas9-GFP or
pEGFP-N3.
CRISPR-Cas9 precisely enables specific genomic
locus manipulation by providing sgRNA. To evaluate
whether CRISPR-Cas9 complexed with ABCB1 sgRNA
could inhibit P-gp expression, Western blotting was
performed. The results demonstrated that P-gp protein

Potential publication bias was assessed by Begg’s
funnel plot and Egger’s test [31, 32]. Among 11 cohorts
evaluating survival outcome, no obvious asymmetry was
observed in Begg’s funnel plots, and the Begg’s test results
also showed no potential publication bias (P = 0.213 >
0.05). The Egger’s test results also showed no potential
publication bias (t =1.14, P =0.282>0.05).
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis investigates the influence
of each individual study on the overall meta-analysis
estimate, which computes the pooled HRs by omitting
one study in each turn. The results of sensitivity analysis
show whether the studies are convincing and stable. In the
leave-one-out sensitivity analyses for P-gp expression in
osteosarcoma, it demonstrated that all data assessing the
prognostic role of high P-gp expression in patients with
osteosarcoma were stable as the endpoint.

expression was significantly inhibited in KHOSR2 cells
transfected with ABCB1-Cas9-GFP. P-gp expression
of KHOSR2 was repressed 11.34 ± 1.93 fold (p < 0.01)
(Figure 4B & 4C). In the U-2OSR2 cells transfected with
ABCB1-Cas9-GFP, P-gp expression was also significantly
inhibited. P-gp expression of U-2OSR2 was repressed 5.80
± 1.25 fold (p < 0.05) (Figure 4B & 4C). Furthermore,
as expected, Cas9 protein was expressed in KHOSR2
and U-2OSR2 cells transfected with ABCB1-Cas9-GFP
(Figure 4B). These data revealed that P-gp expression
was efficiently repressed in MDR osteosarcoma cell lines
transfected with ABCB1-Cas9-GFP.

After ABCB1 was knocked out by CRISPR-Cas9,
we found that doxorubicin exhibited an increase in antiproliferative activity in KHOSR2-ABCB1-Cas9-GFP and
U-2OSR2-ABCB1-Cas9-GFP cells in a dose-dependent
manner, while cisplatin showed no significant difference
in anti-proliferative activity in the ABCB1 knockout cells
compared with that of the control cells (Figure 5). Notably,
when the delivery of doxorubicin concentration was 1.0
μM, growth inhibition was observed in KHOSR2 cells
with or without transfection with pEGFP-N3, and when

KHOSR2 cells and the KHOSR2 cells transfected with

1.43 μM, respectively, which was reduced to 0.05 μM
when the cells were transfected with ABCB1-Cas9-GFP.
Likewise, the MDR cell line U-2OSR2 and U-2OSR2
cells transfected with pEGFP-N3 displayed a similar
trend-the IC50 of doxorubicin was 0.95 μM and 1.25 μM,
respectively, which decreased to 0.02 μM when the cells

that expression of P-gp can be efficiently blocked by
the CRISPR-Cas9 system and inhibition of ABCB1 was
associated with reversing drug resistance in osteosarcoma
MDR cell lines (KHOSR2 and U-2OSR2) to doxorubicin.
However, down regulation of P-gp had no effect on
chemosensitivity to cisplatin in the ABCB1 knockout cells
compared with the control cells.
Previously, we observed that MDR1 siRNA
loaded dextran nanoparticles can efficiently suppressed
P-gp expression in drug resistant osteosarcoma cell
lines. However, RNAi based techniques can achieve
only temporary and partial knockdown of transcribed
mRNA, but not genomic DNA [9]. In this study, we
adopted the CRISPR-Cas9 system to knockout ABCB1
in osteosarcoma MDR cell lines. The position of ABCB1

sgRNA that lies next to a PAM sequence. Compared to
RNAi, the advantages of the CRISPR-Cas9 system include
the fact that CRISPR-Cas9 is an exogenous system that
does not compete with endogenous processes and that it
functions at the DNA level to target transcripts, which
results in knockdown or complete elimination of gene
function [30]. Furthermore, the mechanism of CRISPRCas9 that directly blocks transcription is distinct from
that of RNAi, for which knockdown of gene expression
requires the destruction of already transcribed mRNAs
prior to their translation [33, 34]. In addition, CRISPRCas9 could provide a larger targetable sequence space in
which promoters of the gene may also be targeted [30].
Thus, CRISPR-Cas9 is a novel genome editing tool for
switching gene expression at the DNA level [30].
CRISPR-Cas9 guided gene targeting is highly
specific [33, 35]. To evaluate the specificity of CRISPRCas9 on a genome-wide scale, scientists performed
whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq)
of Cas9-transformed cells with and without sgRNA coexpression [33]. In the presence of the sgRNA targeted to
red fluorescent protein (mRFP), the mRFP transcript was
the sole gene that exhibited a decrease in abundance [33].
Furthermore, scientists also performed RNA-seq on cells
with different sgRNAs that target different genes. None
of these experiments showed significant changes in other

genes besides the target gene [33]. In our study, the results
showed that CRISPR-Cas9 guided by ABCB1 sgRNA
markedly decreased P-gp expression in osteosarcoma
MDR cell lines, whereas pEGFP-N3 had no effect on
KHOSR2 or U-2OSR2 cell lines. Knockout of ABCB1
by CRISPR-Cas9 restored the sensitivity of osteosarcoma
MDR cell lines to doxorubicin, but not to cisplatin. These
studies imply that sgRNA guided gene targeting and
regulation is highly specific and ABCB1 sgRNA guided
CRISPR-Cas9 can specifically knock out ABCB1.
Robust gene editing has been observed in both
reporter genes and endogenous genes by CRISPRCas9 system [36]. CRISPR-Cas9 is capable of inducing
loss of function (LOF) and gain of function (GOF)
mutations in vitro and in vivo. In our study, by delivering
the combination of ABCB1 sgRNA and Cas9 with
Lipofectamine® 3000 Reagent, P-gp protein expression
was significantly silenced. There are several factors that
affect repression efficiency. Firstly, the DNA carrier could
influence the transfection efficiency and gene expression.
In some studies, common lentiviral constructs were used
to express both Cas9 and sgRNAs to achieve stable long
term gene knockdown [36]. They observed 5- to 15-fold
repression of both reporter genes and endogenous genes
in human [36]. In our study, transfection of sgRNA-Cas9
into KHOSR2 and U-2OSR2 cells was performed with

Figure 5: After ABCB1 was knocked out by CRISPR-Cas9, doxorubicin exhibited an increase in anti-proliferative
activity in MDR osteosarcoma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner A, B. while cisplatin showed no significant difference in
anti-proliferative activity in the ABCB1 knockout cells compared with that of the control cells C, D. In the KHOSR2 cells alone, KHOSR2
cells transfected with pEGFP-N3, and KHOSR2-ABCB1-Cas9-GFP cells, the IC50 of doxorubicin was 1.71 μM, 1.43 μM, and 0.05 μM,
respectively. Likewise, the U-2OSR2 cells alone, U-2OSR2 transfected with pEGFP-N3, and U-2OSR2-ABCB1-Cas9-GFP cells, the IC50
of doxorubicin was 0.95 μM, 1.25 μM, and 0.02 μM respectively.

Lipofectamine® 3000 Reagent, and P-gp expression was
repressed 5.80- to 11.34-fold. This is comparable to the
efficiency of existing gene editing techniques, such as
RNAi or transcription activator-like effector nucleases
(TALENs) [30, 36]. Secondly, it is important for silencing
efficiency that the location of the sgRNA target sequence
be adjacent to the gene [33]. In a study, scientists noted
that repression by CRISPR-Cas9 was inversely correlated
with the target distance from the transcription start site
[30]. The same results were shown by another group, and
in their studies, efficient activation of endogenous genes
could be achieved by three to five sgRNAs binding within
a 300 bp region upstream of the transcription start site
[35]. Using additional sgRNAs to target further upstream
or downstream regions did not significantly improve the
level of induction. Their data suggest that only a small
number of sgRNAs targeting the proximal promoter is
sufficient to activate endogenous genes [35]. In our study,
we adopted sgRNA binding at the fifth exon of the ABCB1
gene, which was able to knockout ABCB1 efficiently.
Interestingly, while this manuscript was in the preparation,
another group has used CRISPR-Cas9 to targeting ABCB1
in canine kidney II cell line. This study also showed canine
ABCB1 can be efficiently knocked out by CRISPR-Cas9
[37].
In summary, we demonstrated that overexpression
of P-gp could predict poor survival in patients with
osteosarcoma. Our finding indicates that CRISPR-Cas9
is a powerful gene editing technology that can knockout
ABCB1 successfully. ABCB1 knockout could restore the
sensitivity of osteosarcoma MDR cell lines to doxorubicin.
These results suggest that the CRISPR-Cas9 system
will be useful in extending the long-term efficacy of
chemotherapy by reversing P-gp-mediated MDR in the
clinical setting.

also performed a search for references of retrieved articles
in order to identify other potentially eligible studies. The
language was limited to English. Overlapping data from
the same authors were excluded from our meta-analysis.
Two independent reviewers firstly searched
potentially relevant studies by reading the titles and
abstracts and then further checked by reading the full texts
and assessed for inclusion. Other two senior reviewers
double checked these extracted articles for a second time.
Disagreements were resolved by discussion among these
reviewers and consultation with another senior reviewer.
Eligibility criteria
Studies were considered eligible according to
following criteria: (i) patients with osteosarcoma was
studied; (ii) the associations between P-gp expression
and survival outcome of patients were investigated; and
(iii) sufficient data was provided to estimate RRs and
corresponding 95%CIs.
Articles were excluded if they met the following
criteria: (i) reviews, case reports, comments, conference
abstracts, animal studies and laboratory studies; (ii) studies
of non-dichotomous data; (iii) lack of crucial information
to estimate RR and 95% CI.
Quality assessment
Two investigators critically assessed the quality of
all the included studies based on the critical guidelines
of the Dutch Cochrane Centre proposed by MOOSE
for prognostic meta-analysis [38]. The key points of
the review checklist included the following: (i) clear

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Meta analysis
This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance
with the standard guidelines of Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) 2009 Checklist (http://www.prismastatement.

Studies in Epidemiology group (MOOSE) [38].

General characteristics of the eligible articles in the
meta-analysis were collected: name of the first author,
year of publication, case number, origin of population,
detection methods and prognosis outcome.
RRs with their 95% CIs were extracted according to
the following methods [39]. Reported results for survival
in included studies were considered eligible. In most
instances, the total number of observed death cases and
the number of samples in each group or the valuable data
provided by the authors were extracted to calculate RRs.
If only Kaplan–Meier curves are available, data were
extracted from the graphical survival plots to estimate the
RRs following the previously described method [39]. If

The pEGFP-N3 plasmid was purchased from Clontech
Laboratories, Inc. (Mountain View, CA, USA). Plasmids
were purified using QIAGEN Plasmid Mega Kits

needed, we sought original data directly from the authors
of the relevant studies. All the results extracted according
to the above methods were compared, and disagreements
were discussed among all the authors to resolve with
consensus. The pooled RRs with their 95% CIs and P
values were reported as the results, with an RR >1 being
associated with elevated risk of mortality.
The association of P-gp expression with prognostic
outcome in osteosarcoma was estimated by using RR and
their associated 95% CI for each study. Heterogeneity
of combined RRs was assessed by Cochran’s Q test and
Higgin’s I2 statistic [40]. Heterogeneity was considered
statistically significant as P<0.05 or I2 > 50%. A fixed
effect model (Mantel-Haenszel test) was applied in the
absence of between-study heterogeneity (P ≥ 0.05 or I2 ≤
50 %) [41], while the random effect model (Der Simonian
and Laird method) was applied if significant heterogeneity
was observed (P < 0.05 or I2 > 50 %) [42].
The Begg’s funnel plot and Egger’s bias indicator
test were used to evaluate the potential publication bias
among the included studies [38,39]. P<0.05 in all the
two-sided statistical tests was regarded as significant.
No corrections were made for multiple comparisons. All
analyses were conducted using the STATA package version
12.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA).

instructions. Briefly, U-2OSR2 and KHOSR2 cells were
seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1.0×105 cells/
mL and 7×104 cells/mL, respectively, with 1 mL of
cells per well. After 24 h, Opti-MEM® Medium was
used to rinse the cells three times and 1 mL of serumfree medium was added for cell culturing. Then, 1.5 μl
of Lipofectamine® 3000 Reagent was diluted in 50 μl of
Opti-MEM® Medium, and a master mix of 1 μg DNA in
50 μl of Opti-MEM® Medium was prepared with 2.0 μl
P3000™ Reagent. Next, the diluted DNA was added to the
tube of diluted Lipofectamine® 3000 Reagent (1:1 ratio).
After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, the DNAlipid complex was added to the cells. After incubation
for 48 h, the positive cells successfully transfected with
ABCB1 sgRNA-Cas9-GFP plasmid were sorted by flow
cytometry and the cultures were expanded for further
study; untransfected cells were used as controls.

In vitro studies
Human osteosarcoma MDR cell lines
The osteosarcoma MDR cell lines U-2OSR2
(established by selection with doxorubicin) and KHOSR2
(established by selection with doxorubicin) were previous
reported by our laboratory [9, 29, 43, 44]. These cell lines
with high level of P-gp were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented
with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100μg/
mL streptomycin (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY,
USA). Cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2-95% air
atmosphere and passaged when near-confluent monolayers
were achieved using trypsin-EDTA solution.

Fluorescence microscope observation
To observe the transfection efficiency of ABCB1Cas9-GFP or pEGFP-N3 plasmid expression into the
U-2OSR2 and KHOSR2 cells, fluorescence analysis used
to determine the GFP expression levels in the transfected
cells. Briefly, U-2OSR2 and KHOSR2 cells were seeded
in 12-well plates at a density of 1.0×105 cells/ml and
7×104 cells/ml, respectively, with 1 mL of cells per well.
The cells were then transfected with ABCB1-Cas9-GFP
or pEGFP-N3 plasmid. After incubation for 48 h, the
cells were evaluated under fluorescence. Osteosarcoma
MDR cells were then visualized on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U
fluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments, Inc., NY)
equipped with a SPOTRT digital camera from Diagnostic
Instruments, Inc. (Sterling Heights, MI).

Drugs
Doxorubicin and cisplatin were provided by the
pharmacy at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer
Center. The stock solutions of doxorubicin were prepared
according to the manufacturer’s specifications and stored
at -20°C.
CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid design and purification
The CRISPR-Cas9 and green fluorescent protein
(GFP) fusion protein expression vector U6gRNACas9+2A-GFP guide by ABCB1 sgRNA (abbreviated
as ABCB1-Cas9-GFP) was purchased from Horizon
Discovery (DNA 2.0 Inc., CA, USA). GFP was coexpressed from the same mRNA as the Cas9 protein
via a 2A peptide linkage, which enabled tracking of

Western blotting
After transfection of the ABCB1-Cas9-GFP plasmid,
expression of the P-gp protein in KHOSR2 and U-2OSR2
cells was evaluated by Western blotting. Protein lysates

from osteosarcoma cells were extracted using 1× RIPA
Lysis Buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA,
USA). The protein concentrations were determined by
Protein Assay Reagents (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
and a SPECTRAmax Microplate Spectrophotometer from
Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The primary
monoclonal antibodies for ABCB1 (1:1000 dilution)
and Cas9 (1:1000 dilution) were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Secondary
antibodies IRDye®800CW or IRDye®680LT were
purchased from LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE, USA).
Western blotting analyses were carried out as previously
described12. Membrane signals were scanned using the
Odyssey infrared imaging system and analyzed using
Odyssey 3.0 software (LI-COR Biosciences, NE, USA).
Relative expression values were normalized assigning the
value of the cells in control groups to 1.0.

COMPETING FINANCIAL INTEREST

MTT assay

The authors declare no competing financial interests.

The MTT assay was performed to estimate the
drug resistance profile of the tested cells to doxorubicin
and cisplatin. Briefly, KHOSR2 or U-2OSR2 cells
transfected with or without pEGFP-N3 or ABCB1-Cas9GFP were seeded into 96-well culture plates at a density
of 3×103 cells per well. The cells were then treated with
increasing concentrations of doxorubicin or cisplatin
for five days. Afterwards, 20 µL of MTT (5 mg/mL in
PBS, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) was
added to each well and the plates were incubated for an
additional four hours. Finally, the resulting formazan
product was dissolved with acid (HCl)-isopropanol and
the absorbance at a wavelength of 490nm was read on
a SPECTRAmax Microplate Spectrophotometer from
Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Experiments
were done in triplicate. Dose-response curves were fitted
using GraphPad PRISM 5 software (GraphPad Software,
La Jolla, CA).

Statistical analysis
GraphPad PRISM 5 software (GraphPad Software,
La Jolla, CA) was used to statistically analyze the data.
The differences between groups were also evaluated using
the two-sided Student’s t-test. Errors were SD of averaged
results, p values <0.05 were considered statistically
significant between means, and p values <0.01 were
accepted as a significant difference between means.
