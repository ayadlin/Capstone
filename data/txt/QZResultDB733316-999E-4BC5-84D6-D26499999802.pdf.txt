ABSTRACT
Image-guided drug delivery is of great clinical interest. Here, we explored a
direct way, namely CEST theranostics, to detect diamagnetic anticancer drugs simply
through their inherent Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI signal,
and demonstrated its application in image-guided drug delivery of nanoparticulate
chemotherapeutics. We first screened 22 chemotherapeutic agents and characterized
the CEST properties of representative agents and natural analogs in three major
categories, i.e., pyrimidine analogs, purine analogs, and antifolates, with respect to
chemical structures. Utilizing the inherent CEST MRI signal of gemcitabine, a widely
used anticancer drug, the tumor uptake of the i.v.-injected, drug-loaded liposomes was
successfully detected in CT26 mouse tumors. Such label-free CEST MRI theranostics
provides a new imaging means, potentially with an immediate clinical impact, to
monitor the drug delivery in cancer.

INTRODUCTION

central role. Currently, there is an extensive investment
in the development of molecular imaging techniques that
can assess the effectiveness of drug delivery to the tumor
[4]. One technical hurdle for the implementation of these
approaches, however, is the requirement to chemically or
physically attach imaging probes to the drug molecules or
drug carriers, which may hamper clinical translation.
In this present study, Chemical Exchange Saturation
Transfer (CEST) MRI [5-7] is utilized to directly detect
non-chemically labeled chemotherapeutic agents. CEST
contrast agents, unlike the commonly used T1 and T2
contrast agents, do not rely on the use of paramagnetic
labels (i.e., Gd, Fe, or Mn), which makes the use of
highly biocompatible, diamagnetic compounds possible.
As shown in Figure 1, CEST MRI contrast is generated
by the continuous application of RF saturation pulses
at the resonance of exchangeable protons in the CEST
agent and results in saturated protons (protons with nulled
NMR signal), which, due to the nature of the proton

Cancer still remains one of the most formidable
diseases to cure. Currently, curing unresectable cancers
mainly relies on chemotherapies, but the clinical outcome
is discouraging, and the patients’ quality of life is often
poor due to the severe adverse effects. Achieving effective
anticancer drug therapy requires not only a certain level of
effectiveness of an anticancer drug against specific types
of cancer cells, but also the ability to deliver enough of the
drug to exceed a threshold effective level of activity over
the full anatomic extent of the cancer cell population. The
heterogeneity of the tumor often results in unpredictable
outcomes in individual patients [1, 2]. Thus, it is essential
to develop tools with which to assess whether drugs are
delivered to the tumor at an adequate concentration and
subsequently adjust the treatment plan accordingly, a
so-called “personalized medicine” strategy [3], in which
non-invasive imaging modalities are expected to play a

exchange, are continuously transferred to the surrounding
water, resulting in the saturation of a significant portion
of the water MR signal. Practically, the requirement for
a diamagnetic compound to be CEST MRI-detectable
is to have water-exchangeable protons with a slow-tomoderate exchange rate (i.e., kex <<Δω, where kex is the
exchange rate and Δω is the frequency difference between
the chemical shifts of a given exchangeable proton and
the water protons) and an offset sufficiently far from the
water proton resonance to avoid interference of large
direct saturation effects, which are often the case for a
wide array of medically relevant compounds, including
glucose [8, 9], glutamate [10] and peptides [11], proteins
[12], pyrimidine compounds [13] and even therapeutic
bacterial cells [14]. Based on our previous studies on
the relationship between CEST properties and chemical
structures, we hypothesized that CEST MRI could be used
for the label-free detection of many anticancer drugs using
their inherent exchangeable protons, in hydroxyl (OH),
amide(NH), and amine (NH2) groups.

gemcitabine (dFdC), cytarabine (araC), decitabine (Dec),
and azacitidine (Aza), which are either approved or in
clinical trials, and their natural analog deoxycytidine
(dC). As shown in Figure 2a, all drugs have a chemical
structure similar to that of deoxycytidine. Our in vitro
results showed that, as expected, all of these anticancer
drugs (in PBS solution, pH = 7.4 and 37°C) exhibited two
strong CEST MRI signals, around 2.0-2.4 ppm and 1.0
ppm, corresponding to the amino and hydroxyl protons
respectively. In Figures 2b-2d, CEST signals are shown
in both Z-spectra (solid lines), in which the water proton
signal is plotted as a function of saturation frequency, and
in MTRasym plots (dotted lines), a more quantitative metric
defined by: MTRasym = (S-Δω - SΔω)/S0, where S-Δω and SΔω
are the MRI signal intensities after saturation at negative
and positive values of the offset frequency Δω from the
water proton frequency (set at 0 ppm by convention); S0 is
the intensity in the absence of a saturation pulse. Maximal
MTRasym values of 0.119±0.007 and 0.129±0.025 could be
achieved for 20 mM dFdC at offsets of 2.2-2.3 ppm and
+1.0 ppm, respectively, when a continuous wave RF (B1 =
3.6 µT and tsat = 4 sec) saturation pulse was used.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The pH dependence of CEST MRI signal of
cytidine-based anticancer drugs

Cytidine analogue anticancer drugs can be
directly detected by CEST MRI

We measured the CEST contrast of gemcitabine in a
pH range from 2 to 9, as shown in Figure 3. We also used
the frequency-labeled exchange (FLEX) transfer method

To test our hypothesis, we first examined the
four widely used cytidine analogue anticancer drugs,

Figure 1: The principle of CEST MRI detection of anticancer drugs, such as gemcitabine. Exchangeable protons on the drug

molecules can transfer RF saturation to the protons of surrounding water (top row), resulting in a decrease in MRI signal. Continuously
applying RF pulses leads to the saturation of more water protons, generating a detectable MRI contrast called Chemical Exchange Saturation
Transfer (CEST) contrast (bottom row).

Sensitivity of the CEST MRI detection

as previously described [13, 15] to determine the exchange
rate of the amine protons of dFdC at different pH. The
results revealed a strong pH effect on the CEST contrast
of hydroxyl protons. For example, the CEST MRI signal
of OH protons increases dramatically (> 2 times) when
the pH drops from pH 8 to pH 6. In contrast, the CEST
contrast of NH2 is relatively stable in pH range from 6.5
to 7.5. For this reason, we chose the CEST MRI signal
of NH2 (i.e., ~2.3 ppm in the pH range of 6.5 to 7.5) for
quantifying dFdC. Similar pH dependences for other drugs
were observed (Figure S2).
Interestingly, at pH 3, the CEST contrast of OH is
completely gone while that of NH2 is shifted from 2.2 ppm
to 3.4 ppm (Figure 3b). The pKa of the amine protons
of dFdC was estimated to be 4.3 (Table S1, calculated
using Advanced Chemistry Development (ACD/Labs)
Software V11.02). Hence, the shift of amine CEST is
likely due to the protonation of NH2 (pKa = 4.3) and the
protonated NH3+ having a new chemical shift at ~ 3.4 ppm.
However, it may stem from the OH protons of sugar [9].
The exact assignment of this chemical shift is still under
investigation.

To evaluate the minimal concentration for using
CEST MRI to detect gemcitabine, we performed
CEST MRI on the samples containing gemcitabine
at a concentration ranging from 0.5 mM to 20 mM. To
mimic the in vivo baseline magnetization transfer effect,
we also prepared samples in 1% or 2% agarose gel. The
results are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows that the
MTRasym values at 2.3 ppm and 1.0 ppm, for NH2 and OH
protons respectively, have a very good linearity in the
concentration below 10 mM, indicating that the MTRasym
can be used directly to quantify concentration. Figure 4b
shows the CEST signal of NH2 protons of dFdC at low
concentrations (i.e., 0.5 to 2 mM) in 1% and 2% agarose
gel phantoms. Interestingly, agarose gel itself has a small
but detectable CEST signal, suggesting it may be a better
phantom to determine the minimum detection sensitivity
by mimicking the in vivo condition.
We used two methods to determine the minimum
detection sensitivity. First, we performed a statistical

analysis (the two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test, n = 3)
to determine the minimum concentration of gemcitabine
that can generate a significant difference in CEST signal
between just agarose gel and gemcitabine containing
agarose gel. As shown in Figure 4c, a significant
difference could be achieved for samples containing 1
mM or higher gemcitabine but not those containing 0.5
mM gemcitabine. The P values were determined to be
0.0007 and 0.0106 for 1 mM gemcitabine in 1% and 2%
agarose gel respectively, with both showing significant
differences (i.e., P < 0.05) compared to the reference gel
samples. Second, we also adapted a previously published
contrast-to-noise Ratio (CNR)-based approach [16] to
determine the detection threshold in the presence of
systemic noise. As shown in Figure 4d, when a ∆CNR
threshold of 2√2 was used [16], the minimum detection
sensitivity was estimated to be <1 mM for PBS samples

and 1-2 mM for gel samples. It should be noted that the
estimation of CEST detectability is affected by the choice
of CNR threshold and CNR thresholds in different range
(i.e., 0.6-2) have been reported previously [17, 18]. When
a ∆CNR threshold = 1 was used, for instance, the detection
limit was estimated to be 0.5 mM for gemcitabine in 1%
agarose gel. In comparison, the typical detectability for
small molecular Gd-based contrast agents is in the range
of hundreds μM to mM [19] and that of 19F MRI is in the
range of tens of mM [20]. Our study suggests that CEST
MRI can provide a similar detectability as those imaging
contrast generation strategies.
It also should be noted that the results shown in
Figure 4 were acquired using a 3.6 µT, 3-second CW
saturation pulse at a spatial resolution of 130x130 µm2.
Because the saturation parameters significantly affect
the MTRasym, a new, saturation-parameter-independent

to determine the detectability (or sensitivity) of a CEST
agent.

an experimental tumor model. The liposomal dFdC was
prepared using a procedure described previously [21, 22]
and a liposomal formulation (DPPC: cholesterol: DPPEPEG = 55:45:5) [23], with an additional 0.5% rhodamineB-PE (fluorescent dye). The starting solution contained
50 mg/ml gemcitabine hydrochloride (pH ~ 3). The size
of formed liposomes was measured to be ~120 nm using
a dynamic light scattering Nanosizer. The encapsulation
rate was estimated as ~30.8%, using the UV absorbance at
268.8 nm of dFdC. Our in vitro drug release assay showed
that the initial release of dFdC was very rapid, i.e., ~34%
of loaded dFdC within the first three hours of dialysis. The
concentration of intra-liposomal dFdC was then stable and
only decreased 4.4% over a period of 24 hours (Figures
S4). As shown in Figure 6, the encapsulation of dFdC in
liposomes doesn’t have a noticeable impact on the CEST
properties, as evidenced by the similarity between the
shape of the MTRasym plot of liposomal dFdC and that of
free form, at both pH 7.4 and pH 3.0.
We then performed CEST MRI on CT26 tumorbearing mice before and after the injection of liposomal
dFdC. To enhance the intratumoral accumulation of
systemically administered liposomes, mice also received
a co-treatment of TNF-α, which was shown previously
to increase the tumor permeability substantially [24, 25].
Figure 7 shows that liposomal dFdC could be readily
detected in TNF-α-treated CT26 tumors five hours after
a tail vein injection of 20 mg lipid/kg b.w. (c.a. 80 mg
dFdC/kg b.w.) and TNF-α (1 µg per mouse). A relatively
uniform elevation of CEST MRI signal at 3.2 ppm was
conspicuous at five hours after the injection (Figure 7a).
The accumulation of liposomal dFdC in the tumor resulted
in a net increase of 0.015 in MTRasym (Figures 7b and 7c)
as compared to that before the injection. The average
increase of CEST contrast in the three tumors studied
(Figure 7d) was 0.022±0.012 (the paired two-tailed
Student’s t test: P < 0.05, n = 3). The CEST MRI detection
of tumor uptake of liposomal dFdC was validated using
fluorescence imaging (Figures 7f, S7&S8). Our results
suggest that our approach is capable of directly monitoring
delivery of nanoparticulate chemotherapeutics. Moreover,

CEST MRI can be used to detect antitumor drugs
in other categories
We then expanded our approach to other antitumor
drug categories. Among the twenty-two anticancer
drugs (Table S4) that we investigated, antifolates (e.g.,
methotrexate and the drug modulator folinic acid) and
purine analogs (e.g., fludarabine) showed good CEST MRI
detectability (Figure 5). These results imply that CEST
MRI can be used to detect any drug that has exchangeable
protons (amides, amines, and hydroxyls) at the appropriate
exchange rate, hence has a widespread application.
Compounds sharing similar chemical structures
showed similar CEST signals, indicating the possibility
to predict the CEST properties based on the chemical
structure of a given drug, as suggested in previous studies
[13]. Thus, the properties of exchangeable protons
can be substantially affected by surrounding chemical
modification, which results in changes in the CEST signal.
For example, when pyrimidine is replaced by triazine, the
NH2 protons of decitabine (Dec) and azacitidine (Aza)
show much stronger CEST effects (i.e., MTRasym (2.3
ppm) = 0.23 and 0.31, respectively) than that of dC (i.e.,
MTRasym (2.1 ppm) = 0.12). In contrast, the CEST signal
of hydroxyl protons appears to be mainly affected by the
number of protons.

Use CEST MRI to monitor liposome-mediated
drug delivery to the tumor
The direct visualization of drugs using CEST MRI
should allow the label-free tracking of a nanoparticle drug
delivery system. To demonstrate this, we encapsulated
gemcitabine into liposomes (i.e., liposomal dFdC) and
used CEST to monitor the tumor uptake of liposomes in

as TNF-α is being investigated clinically for improving
the drug delivery of chemotherapy [26], this approach
may also be useful for assessing the tumor responses to
the combination of nanomedicine and TNF-α or other
vascular-targeting treatment.
The capability to directly track drug-loaded
nanoparticles without additional imaging labels is expected
to be very helpful for both pre-clinical development and
the clinical use of nanoparticulate chemotherapeutic
agents. There are more than 45 nanoparticulate drug
formulations that have been clinically approved, and at
least 200 products are currently in Phase I-III clinical
trials [27]. If some of them can be tailored into theranostic
(therapeutic and diagnostic [28]) systems via the proposed
CEST MRI method, they can be used directly in the clinic
to stratify patients and enable personalized medicine.

Moreover, the high local concentration of the drugs
loaded in the nanoparticle carriers also helps to boost
the sensitivity of CEST, potentially can be used to lessen
the requirement of low mM concentration drugs for the
CEST MRI detection. Thus our application should have
a great impact to nanomedicine in addition to traditional
chemotherapies. One limitation of our method is that it
is currently unable to detect small molecular drugs at
therapeutic concentrations (e.g. ~ µM). We will continue
to work on improving the detectability of the proposed
approach with the help of novel CEST techniques [19, 29,
30] in an effort to broaden application. Another technical
challenge is the translation of our methods developed
on 9.4 T and 11.7T small animal scanners to clinical 3T
scanners. While currently many groups are working on this
issue and there are indeed a handful of recently developed

successfully translated, this will need to be demonstrated
for the approach suggested here.

50:45:5) [23] with an additional 0.5% rhodamine-BPE (fluorescent dye) were dissolved in chloroform (2
mL). The solvent was removed in vacuum to give a thin
lipid film, which was hydrated by shaking in 50 mg/
ml gemcitabine hydrochloride (pH ~ 3) at 50 °C for 2
h. The vesicle suspension was sonicated for 30 seconds
and then extruded successively through 0.4 and 0.1 μm
polycarbonate membranes to obtain the final liposomes
with low polydispersity at the desired size. The average
size and polydispersity index were then measured by
dynamic light scattering experiments on a Zetasizer Nano
ZS90 (Malvern Instruments, Southborough, MA). The
liposomes were then filtered through Sephadex G-50 gel
columns (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburg, PA)
twice to remove unloaded drugs, and stored at 4 °C prior
to use. The average size of liposomes was measured as
~120 nm and final lipid concentration was about 20 mg
lipid /ml.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
MRI
In vitro CEST images were acquired on a 9.4T
Bruker Avance system equipped with a 15 mm sawtooth
RF coil. A modified RARE sequence (TR = 6.0 sec,
effective TE = 43.2 ms, RARE factor = 16, slice thickness
= 0.7 mm, FOV = 14x14 mm, matrix size = 128x64,
resolution = 0.11x0.22 mm2, and NA = 2) [16] including
a magnetization transfer (MT) module (one CW pulse,
B1 = 3.6 μT (150 Hz), 3 sec) was used to acquire CEST
weighted images from -10 ppm to 10 ppm (step = 0.2 ppm)
around the water resonance (0 ppm) [32]. The absolute
water resonant frequency shift was measured using the
WAter Saturation Shift Reference (WASSR) [33] method
modified with Lorentzian analysis. The same parameters
as in CEST imaging were used except TR = 1.5 sec,
tsat = 500 ms, B1 = 0.5 μT (21.3 Hz) and the saturation
frequency swept from -1 ppm to 1 ppm (step = 0.1 ppm).
In vivo images were acquired on an 11.7 T Bruker
Biospec horizontal bore scanner (Bruker Biosciences,
Billerica, MA) equipped with a 23 mm Circular Polarized
MRI transceiver volume coil. The same imaging scheme
described above was used with the addition of a fat
suppression pulse (3.4 ms hermite pulse, offset = -3.5
ppm). The acquisition parameters were: TR = 5.0 sec,
effective TE = 6 ms, RARE factor = 10, tsat = 3 sec, B1
= 3.6 μT (150 Hz), slice thickness = 1 mm, acquisition
matrix size = 128x64, FOV = 20x20 mm, and NA = 2.
Due to the B0 field inhomogeneity, we incremented the
saturation offset ± 1 ppm (0.1 ppm steps) with respect to
water for B0 mapping.
Data processing was performed using customwritten scripts in MATLAB (Mathworks, Waltham, MA).
CEST spectra were calculated from the mean of an ROI
placed over each sample after B0 correcting the contrast
on a per voxel basis. The CEST signal was quantified
using MTRasym at particular offsets of interest (i.e. Δω =
+2.2 ppm) using the definition: MTRasym = (S-Δω - S+Δω)/
S0, where and S [-Δω, +Δω] is the water signal intensity in the
presence of saturation pulse at offsets ±Δω, and S0 is the
water signal intensity in the absence of saturation pulses.

Animals
All experiments conducted with mice were
performed in accordance with protocols approved by the
Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC). CT26 (CRL-2638) murine
colorectal adenocarcinoma cells were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown
in McCoy’s 5A Medium (Invitrogen/Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine
Serum (FBS, HyClone, Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Five million CT26 cells
were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of
female BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks; Harlan, Indianapolis,
IN; ~20 g in weight), and allowed to grow for ~10 days.
Ten days after implantation, mice (n = 3, each group)
received a tail vein injection of 100 mg lipid/kg b.w.
(c.a. 80 mg gemcitabine/kg b.w.) with or without TNF-α
(1 µg per mouse). TNF-α was reconstituted freshly
before administration in doubly- distilled H2O at 100 μg/
mL and diluted into 0.1% (w/v) BSA in PBS at a final
concentration of 10 μg/mL. Liposomal gemcitabine was
injected within a few minutes thereafter. The CEST images
were acquired at 4-5 hours after the injection.

Fluorescence imaging
Fluorescence imaging was performed and analyzed
using a Spectrum/ CT IVIS® in vivo imaging system with
the Living Image® software (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA).
Fluorescence signal (emission = 620 nm, excitation = 570
nm) was quantified as radiant efficiency.

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we have demonstrated a labelfree imaging approach to “see” drugs directly, namely
CEST theranostics. We screened a wide array of
chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and confirmed the CEST
MRI contrast of the drugs and their nontoxic analogs
in three major categories: pyrimidine analogs, purine
analogs, and antifolates. We also showed that CEST
MRI could be used synergistically with nanomedicine to
transform currently available therapeutics directly into
theranostics, which enabled the first successful CEST MRI
detection of the tumor uptake of liposomal gemcitabine
without need for synthetic imaging labels. These results
imply that we can potentially transform many currently
available drugs, including those already in the clinic and
those still under pre-clinical development, to be MRIdetectable theranostic agents, WITHOUT any radioactive-,
paramagnetic-, or super-paramagnetic-based labeling.
