23), bile acid production (FGF-19) and glucose utilization
(FGF-21). Hormonal FGFs require co-receptors such and
α-Klotho or β-Klotho to bind and signal via FGFRs [2].
FP-1039 (also known as HGS1036 or GSK3052230)
is designed around FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1). FP-1039
consists of the FGFR1 extracellular domain fused to the
Fc domain of human IgG1. The Fc domain confers a
number of favorable characteristics to FP-1039 including
excellent pharmacokinetics. FP-1039 binds only to select
FGFs – with the highest affinity for the “classical FGFs”
that have been implicated in tumor growth. As described
in our recent paper [3], FP-1039 does not bind to the
hormonal FGFs. Accordingly, FP-1039 targets the “bad”
FGFs that drive cancer growth and at the same time avoids
inhibition of the hormonal FGFs and potential related
toxicities (Fig. 1).
Several companies are targeting the FGF-FGFR
signaling pathway for cancer therapeutics [4]. This
includes small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which
inhibit the signaling of the intracellular kinase domain;
they tend to have broad specificity across FGF receptors
and consequently block most FGF receptor signaling. In
some instances they also inhibit other classes of receptors
(e.g., VEGF receptors). Importantly these pan-FGFR
inhibitors also block the activity of the hormonal FGFs
which may have unwanted side effects. For example,
AZD4547 has reported hyperphosphatemia in 25 of 69

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have been
implicated in multiple aspects of cancer development
and growth for over 20 years [1]. Research has shown
that FGFs have a role in a) directly promoting cancer cell
growth, b) tumor angiogenesis, and c) more speculatively,
the survival of a group of cancer cells called “tumor stem
cells” that are particularly difficult to target with current
therapies. Therefore, inhibition of the FGF pathway has
“multiple ways to win” as a cancer therapeutic.
The FGF family is large: it has 22 different ligand
members (the FGFs) that bind to 4 different receptors
(the FGFRs). FGFRs are type 1 transmembrane receptors
containing a large extracellular domain that bind FGFs,
a transmembrane domain and an intracellular signaling
domain that contains a tyrosine kinase domain. Many
ligands of the FGF family have been implicated in the
initiation, promotion and maintenance of cancer. We term
these cancer-related FGFs “the classical FGFs”. They play
essential roles during normal embryonic development,
but their roles are less important during normal adult life.
During cancer development some tumors hijack the FGF
pathway, thereby increasing the levels of expression of
many FGF family members to promote growth and tumor
metastasis.
A sub-group of the FGF family termed the hormonal
FGFs has a more homeostatic role in the adult that includes
regulating phosphate levels, vitamin D metabolism (FGF-

treated patients in a recently reported Phase 1clinical trial
[5]. Similar phosphate elevations have also been reported
in preclinical toxicology studies of small molecule
FGFR inhibitors [6]. These side effects may potentially
be minimized by a low-phosphate diet, with drugs that
remove phosphate from the blood (chelation therapy),
or stopping the FGF inhibitor drug for a period of time.
Other companies have tried to specifically target individual
FGF receptors using monoclonal antibodies, although in
some cases this has met with unexpected toxicity, as was
previously shown with a monoclonal antibody directed
against FGFR1 that resulted in rapid weight loss in animal
models [7]. Hyperphosphatemia and weight loss have
not been observed with FP-1039 [8]. While targeting
individual FGF ligands may have anti-tumor efficacy in
the absence of toxicity (e.g., FGF-2), FP-1039 has the
advantage in that it is capable of blocking multiple FGFs
that have been implicated in cancer. As such, FP-1039 has
the potential for therapeutic benefit in a broader context
than antibodies that targeting a single FGF.
As a result, FP-1039 is getting closer to the goal of
treating the right patient with the right drug for the right
target. First, FP-1039 has the ability to target and inhibit
only “the classical FGFs” and not the hormonal FGFs, thus
avoiding potential toxicities associated with pan-FGFR
inhibition. Secondly, the direct action against a family
of ligands that have been shown to promote tumor cell
growth and in parallel inhibit tumor blood vessels, allows
clear identification of the target and patient. Our work
has shown that FP-1039 is particularly effective against
tumor models that harbor amplification of the FGFR1
gene. Such amplifications have been observed in lung
cancer, including squamous non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), as well as
breast cancer. The presence of the FGFR1 amplification
may provide a biomarker to identify patients that will be
particularly sensitive to therapy by FP-1039 and therefore,
add to the list of drugs that offer a precision medicine
approach to cancer therapy.
