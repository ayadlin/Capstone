Abstract
Cellular senescence is emerging as an important in vivo anticancer response elicited by multiple stresses, including currently used chemotherapeutic drugs. Nutlin-3a is a recently
discovered small-molecule antagonist of the p53-destabilizing
protein murine double minute-2 (MDM2) that induces cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells with functional p53.
Here, we report that nutlin-3a induces cellular senescence in
murine primary fibroblasts, oncogenically transformed fibroblasts, and fibrosarcoma cell lines. No evidence of druginduced apoptosis was observed in any case. Nutlin-induced
senescence was strictly dependent on the presence of functional p53 as revealed by the fact that cells lacking p53 were
completely insensitive to the drug, whereas cells lacking
the tumor suppressor alternative reading frame product of the
CDKN2A locus underwent irreversible cell cycle arrest.
Interestingly, irreversibility was achieved in neoplastic cells
faster than in their corresponding parental primary cells,
suggesting that nutlin-3a and oncogenic signaling cooperate
in activating p53. Our current results suggest that senescence
could be a major cellular outcome of cancer therapy by
antagonists of the p53-MDM2 interaction, such as nutlin-3a.

Introduction
The tumor suppressor p53 is among the most important antitumoral defenses in mammalian cells. This is reflected by the fact
that the large majority of malignant tumors have acquired mutations that impair the functionality of p53. All together, approximately half of all human malignancies harbor mutations in p53 (1).
The remaining tumors usually contain alterations in the two main
regulators of p53 stability [i.e., amplification of the negative p53
regulator murine double minute-2 (MDM2) or loss of the MDM2
inhibitor alternative reading frame product of the CDKN2A locus
(ARF); refs. 1–3]. In agreement with the high frequency of
aberrations in the ARF/MDM2 regulatory pair, we and others have
recently shown that ARF is critical in mice for p53-dependent
tumor suppression (4, 5).
The importance of ARF for p53-dependent cancer protection
suggests that ARF-mimicking drugs could have therapeutic activity
in p53-proficient cancers. Nutlin-3a was recently discovered as a

small molecule that binds MDM2 at the pocket used for interaction
with p53 (6–8). Hence, nutlin-3a prevents MDM2 from recognizing
p53 and, consequently, it results in stabilization of p53 and
activation of the p53 pathway. p53 is thought to acquire full transcriptional activity by the concurrence of two effects: stabilization, usually achieved by inhibition of MDM2, and posttranslational
modifications produced by stress signaling cascades (1). Cancer
cells, and even normal cells under in vitro culture conditions, are
subject to intrinsic and extrinsic stresses, generally presenting high
constitutive levels of DNA damage signaling; therefore, it is not
surprising that stabilization of p53 by nutlin-3a suffices to trigger
p53 transcriptional activity. Moreover, it is also possible that simple
stabilization of p53, in the absence of stress signaling, could be
sufficient to activate a p53 transcriptional response (9, 10). The
rationale for using MDM2 antagonists in cancer treatment is
twofold (8). First, malignant cells have constitutive stress signals,
particularly DNA damage signaling (11, 12), which presumably will
contribute to enhance the p53 activation upon treatment with a
p53-stabilizing drug. In this regard, additional infliction of damage
to tumor cells by standard genotoxic chemotherapy is known to
enhance the effects of nutlin (13–17). Second, normal cells, by
having intact checkpoints and low stress signaling, are thought to
undergo a mild and transitory p53-dependent cell cycle arrest
after treatment with nutlin, and this transient arrest, in fact,
may protect normal cells from the toxicity of standard chemotherapy (18, 19). The latter approach implies that nutlin, by
protecting normal tissues, could increase the therapeutic window
to standard chemotherapy even in the treatment of p53-deficient
tumors.
The study of the cellular responses elicited by nutlin has been
restricted mainly to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis; however, the
ability of nutlin to induce cellular senescence has remained unexplored. Cellular senescence is emerging as a particular type of cell
cycle arrest of high relevance for tumor suppression and chemotherapy response (20–23). Indeed, there are indications that senescence may play an important role in tumor regression induced by
standard genotoxic chemotherapy (24, 25). Cellular senescence is
triggered by a multitude of stresses and, in general, it requires the
engagement of the Rb and p53 tumor suppressor pathways (26).
A main feature that distinguishes cellular senescence from other
forms of cell cycle arrest is the irreversibility of this phenomenon.
Full engagement of the Rb and p53 pathways results in chromatin
remodeling that includes the heterochromatinization of genes
important for proliferation (27–29). In this manner, cellular senescence is a terminal stage that prevents further proliferation of the
cell, even if the initial causative stress is eliminated or transient.
As we have discussed elsewhere (22), the fact that senescent cells
are viable in vitro for long periods of time does not necessarily
imply a long-term residence time in the context of the organism.
In this regard, it has recently been shown that the induction of

Induction of Senescence by Nutlin-3a

tumor senescence by p53 is followed by clearance of the senescent
cells by the innate immune system, which results in tumor
regression (30, 31). Here, we have taken advantage of genetically
defined mouse cells, either primary or neoplastically transformed,
to examine the ability of nutlin-3a to induce senescence.

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from E13.5
embryos of wild-type (wt), ARF-null (32), p53-null (33), or p21-null (34)
genotype were obtained as previously described (35) and grown in the
presence of atmospheric oxygen and in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone). In all experiments, low-passage
(<3 passages) MEFs were used. Oncogenic Ras (H-RasV12) was ectopically
expressed from vector pLPC-puro and cells were retrovirally transduced
following standard procedures (36). Infected cells were selected with
1.5 Ag/mL puromycin for 2 to 3 days as described (37). Murine fibrosarcoma
cell lines were obtained from tumors induced with 3-methyl-cholanthrene
as previously described (38). On observation of overt tumors, mice were
sacrificed and tumors were excised and processed as follows. The tumor
mass was immersed briefly in PBS with antibiotics. Small pieces of the
tumor mass were minced in DMEM plus 10% FBS with scissors and allowed
to attach to 60-mm-diameter dishes. Clonal cell lines were established from
tumor outgrowths after four to six passages. Nutlin-3a and nutlin-3b were
provided by Hoffman-La Roche, Inc..
Colony formation assays. Cells (104) were seeded in 10-cm-diameter
plates and treatment was initiated the following day by addition of nutlin-3a
or nutlin-3b (5 Amol/L). The drug was added only at the beginning of the
treatment. One week later, cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde and stained
with Giemsa. For reversibility studies, cells were exposed to the drug for
1 week, followed by another week in the absence of the drug.
Proliferation assays. Cells (5  104) were plated in 3.5-cm-diameter
plates and, 24 h later, 5 or 10 Amol/L of nutlin-3a or nutlin-3b was added.
For direct cell counting, attached cells were trypsinized and counted using
a Neubauer chamber slide. Reversibility was evaluated by exposing the cells
to the drug for variable periods of time, as indicated, followed by a recovery
period of 3 days in the absence of the drug. For S-phase and sub-G0-G1
quantification, both floating and attached cells were fixed in 70% ethanol,
resuspended in PBS, and treated with RNase A. Propidium iodide was added
to the cells and cell cycle profiles were analyzed by flow cytometry in a
FACScalibur instrument (BD Biosciences) and using the ModFit software
(Verity Software House).
Senescence-associated B-galactosidase staining. Cells (5  104) were
plated in 3.5-cm-diameter plates and treated for 1 week with nutlin-3a or
nutlin-3b (10 Amol/L). For senescence-activated h-galactosidase (SA-hGal)
staining, we used Senescence-hGal Staining Kit (Cell Signaling Technology)
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunoblots. Whole-cell protein extracts were obtained using RIPA
buffer. For immunoblotting, we used the following primary antibodies: antip53 (NCL-p53-CM-5p, Novocastra), anti–phospho-Ser18 p53 (Cell Signaling
Technology), anti-p21 (p21-C-19-G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MDM2
(2A10, Abcam), and anti–h-actin (clone AC-15, Sigma). Protein levels were
visualized after incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase followed by detection with
enhanced chemiluminescence plus (Amersham).

Results
Nutlin-3a induces p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in primary MEFs. Normal primary MEFs have a limited proliferation
potential under standard culture conditions (i.e., 20% oxygen and
10% serum) due to the accumulation of oxidative and mitogenic
stress (39, 40). The main molecular barrier activated by ‘‘in vitro
culture’’ stress in murine fibroblasts is the ARF/p53 pathway and,
accordingly, ARF-null or p53-null MEFs have an indefinite
proliferative potential in culture (32, 41). Culture stress can be

evaluated by plating cells at low density and scoring their ability to
form colonies. We began our studies on nutlin by evaluating its
effect on colony formation. In the presence of nutlin-3a, primary
ARF-null MEFs lost their capacity to form colonies whereas p53null MEFs were completely insensitive (Fig. 1A). Wild-type MEFs,
as expected, could not form colonies either in the absence or
presence of nutlin-3a. To better define the antiproliferative effect
of nutlin-3a, we carried out short-term proliferation assays. Cell
proliferation was measured directly by cell counting (Fig. 1B)
and by cytometry to measure the proportion of cells in S phase
(Fig. 1C). Nutlin-3a was a potent proliferation inhibitor for wt and
ARF-null MEFs, whereas it had no effect on the proliferation of
p53-null MEFs. As a control, the enantiomer nutlin-3b, which has
150-fold less activity compared with nutlin-3a (7), did not affect the
proliferation of MEFs (Fig. 1B and C). Noteworthy, cell numbers for
wt and ARF-null MEFs remained essentially constant in the
presence of nutlin-3a, suggesting that the drug has a cytostatic
effect on these cells (see Fig. 1B). In this regard, cytometric
analyses did not show evidence of apoptosis in any of the
genotypes on prolonged exposure to nutlin-3a (data not shown).
The activation of p53 by nutlin-3a was confirmed by immunoblot
analysis that showed stabilization of p53, increased p53 phosphorylation at Ser18, and increased levels of the p53 downstream targets
MDM2 and p21 (Fig. 1D). It is known that p21 is an important,
although not essential, mediator of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest
(42). In line with this, we observed that p21-null MEFs arrest
efficiently on treatment with nutlin (Supplementary Fig. S1A),
although the irreversibility of the arrest has slower kinetics
compared with wt MEFs (see below). Together, these results
indicate that nutlin-3a inhibits the proliferation of primary MEFs in
a p53-dependent manner.
Nutlin-3a induces p53-dependent arrest in MEFs expressing
oncogenic Ras. Primary ARF-null MEFs and p53-null MEFs are
permissive to Ras-driven proliferation, whereas wt MEFs undergo a
permanent proliferative arrest, termed oncogene-induced senescence, which is dependent on the activation of the ARF/p53
pathway (43). We wondered whether the presence of oncogenic
signaling would affect the response of cells to nutlin. Primary MEFs
of different genotypes were retrovirally transduced with H-RasV12
and the resulting cells were tested for their sensitivity to nutlin.
The ability of ARF-null/Ras MEFs to form macroscopic colonies
was completely abrogated in the presence of Nultin-3a, whereas
p53-null/Ras MEFs were not affected by the presence of the
drug (Fig. 2A). As expected, wt/Ras MEFs were unable to form
colonies even in the absence of nutlin due to the activation of
oncogene-induced senescence. In short-term assays, the proliferation of ARF-null/Ras MEFs was completely blocked by nutlin-3a,
whereas p53-null/Ras MEFs proliferated in the presence of the
drug (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, Ras-infected wt or p21-null
MEFs had a severely impaired proliferation due to oncogenic stress,
and the residual proliferation disappeared in the presence of
nutlin-3a (see Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S1B). As it was the
case with primary MEFs, the drug seemed to have a cytostatic
effect and no evidence of apoptosis was observed in any of the
Ras-expressing cells regardless of the functionality of the ARF/p53/
p21 pathway (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2C, the stabilization and activation of p53 was confirmed by immunoblot
analysis in MEFs after selection of retrovirally infected cells (i.e.,
before the onset of oncogene-induced senescence in wt/Ras MEFs).
A strong accumulation of p53 and phospho-Ser18 p53 was evident
in wt/Ras and ARF-null/Ras cells treated with nutlin-3a, together

with increased levels of p21 and MDM2. In summary, we conclude
that nutlin-3a blocks Ras-driven proliferation of MEFs in a p53dependent manner.
Nutlin-3a induces p53-dependent senescence. The activation
of the p53 pathway, either by strong DNA damage or by oncogenic
stress, is known to result in an irreversible cell cycle arrest termed
senescence (44, 45). We asked whether the cell cycle arrest
produced by nutlin in primary MEFs and Ras-infected MEFs had
features of senescence. First, nutlin-3a induced a p53-dependent
morphologic change in primary MEFs (not shown) and in Rasinfected cells (Fig. 3A, left), which is compatible with senescence

(i.e., large and flat cells). Moreover, both primary and Ras-infected
ARF-null MEFs treated with nutlin-3a became positive for the
widely used senescence marker SA-hGal (Fig. 3A, right; ref. 46). As a
first approach to evaluate the irreversibility of the arrest induced by
nutlin, we carried out colony formation assays in which cells were
exposed to the drug for 1 week and then were incubated for an
additional week in the absence of the drug. Both primary and Rasinfected ARF-null MEFs were unable to form colonies under these
conditions (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the arrest induced by nutlin is
irreversible after 1 week of exposure to the drug. To estimate the
minimal exposure time required to trigger an irreversible cell cycle

arrest, cells were treated for various time periods and then observed for their ability to resume proliferation. In the case of
primary wt MEFs, 1 day of treatment was sufficient to produce an
irreversible arrest (Fig. 3C). ARF-null MEFs also underwent an
irreversible arrest but this required longer exposure time (4 days;
see Fig. 3C). As anticipated, p53-null MEFs were insensitive to
the drug. Finally, in the case of p21-null MEFs, complete irreversi-

which we interpret as evidence of the involvement of p21 in the
establishment of p53-dependent senescence. The same type of
analysis was done with Ras-expressing MEFs (Fig. 3D). Again, p53null/Ras MEFs were insensitive to nutlin, whereas ARF-null/Ras
MEFs turned out to be extremely sensitive. It is interesting to note
the difference between primary ARF-null and ARF-null/Ras MEFs

with regard to the time required to achieve irreversibility. In the
case of ARF-null/Ras MEFs, the time for irreversibility was significantly shortened compared with primary ARF-null MEFs (1 day
versus 4 days, respectively; see Fig. 3C and D). This differential
sensitivity to nutlin likely reflects a cooperative effect between the
drug and oncogenic Ras, the latter known to activate p53 by
multiple pathways including the generation of DNA damage (47, 48).
Nutlin-3a induces p53-dependent senescence in murine
fibrosarcoma cell lines. In the light of the previous results, we
wondered whether nutlin-3a would also be able to produce p53dependent senescence in fibrosarcoma cell lines. For this, we
generated primary fibrosarcomas in wt and ARF-null mice by
intramuscular injection of a well-known carcinogen, 3-methylcholanthrene. The resulting fibrosarcomas were excised and used
to derive fibrosarcoma cell lines. The status of p53 was determined
by DNA sequencing to identify point mutations and by Northern
blot to identify those cases in which expression is completely lost
(not shown); similarly, the status of ARF was determined by
Northern blot to identify those fibrosarcoma cell lines that had
completely lost the expression of ARF (not shown). Based on these

analyses, we selected a total of seven cell lines (see Fig. 4A). Some
of these cell lines retained functional p53 but had lost the
expression of ARF (p53wt;ARFsilenced, line 1); others were generated
in ARF-null mice and retained functional p53 (p53wt;ARF / ,
lines 2–4); and, finally, others lacked functional p53 (p53mut;ARFwt,
lines 5 and 7; p53mut;ARFsilenced, line 6). We evaluated the effect of
nutlin-3a in these malignant cells and found that the drug
selectively induced cell cycle arrest in the p53-proficient cell lines
(lines 1–4) but not in the p53-deficient cell lines (lines 5–7; Fig. 4A).
As another control, we also obtained fibrosarcoma cell lines from
p53+/ mice, which in all cases had lost p53 expression while
retaining ARF (i.e., p53 / ;ARFwt), and, as anticipated, these cell
lines were completely insensitive to the drug (data not shown).
Once more, apoptosis was not observed in any of the cell lines
evaluated (data not shown). Activation of the p53 pathway in the
p53-proficient cell lines was confirmed by immunoblot analysis
(Fig. 4B). After establishing that nutlin-3a induces p53-dependent
cell cycle arrest in murine fibrosarcoma cells, we wondered
whether this arrest had features of senescence. On exposure to
nutlin-3a, the four p53-proficient cell lines (lines 1–4) gave positive

staining for SA-hGal, whereas the others (lines 5–7) remained
negative and maintained their neoplastic morphology (Fig. 5A).
More importantly, we evaluated the irreversibility of the druginduced arrest and we found that 2 days of treatment was sufficient
to produce a complete and irreversible arrest in most of the p53proficient cell lines (lines 1–3), with the only exception of line 4,
which required 4 or 6 days of treatment before undergoing
irreversible arrest (Fig. 5B). In summary, we conclude that, in
murine fibrosarcoma cell lines, nutlin-3a induces a strong and
irreversible arrest with features of senescence and in a manner that
is strictly dependent on the functionality of p53.

Discussion
Here, we have examined the response to nutlin-3a in a variety of
genetically defined mouse cells. Primary MEFs, oncogenically

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (15). August 1, 2007

transformed fibroblasts, and murine fibrosarcoma cell lines were
all shown to undergo a robust irreversible cell cycle arrest with
features of senescence on exposure to nutlin-3a. In all cases, the
induction of senescence was strictly dependent on the presence of
functional p53. Remarkably, as previously noted (6–8), the
proliferation of cells lacking p53 was essentially unaffected even
after long periods of exposure (1 week; see Figs. 1A and 2A). The
fact that primary p53-null fibroblasts were insensitive to the drug
further reinforces the concept that p53 is the only relevant target
of nutlin. In the case of oncogenically transformed ARF-null
fibroblasts, the exposure time required for irreversible cell arrest
(1 day; see Fig. 3E) was significantly shorter than the time required
in nontransformed primary ARF-null cells (4 days; Fig. 3D). In the
case of fibrosarcoma cell lines, the exposure time required for
irreversibility was more variable, but in three of four cell lines,
irreversibility was achieved after 2 days of drug treatment (Fig. 5B).

Induction of Senescence by Nutlin-3a

We interpret this as evidence of cooperation between nutlin and
oncogenic signaling in p53 activation. These results, derived from
direct comparison of primary and oncogenically transformed cells
of the same origin, provide a strong support to the notion that
MDM2 antagonists are more effective against cancer cells than
against normal cells.
It is noteworthy that no apoptosis was observed in any of the
cells of fibroblast origin used in our study. It has previously been
shown that normal fibroblasts are generally resistant to p53dependent apoptosis and usually undergo cell cycle arrest and/or
senescence after p53 activation. Our results indicate that this
property is retained in fibrosarcoma cell lines. Amplification of the
MDM2 gene and overexpression of the protein is particularly
frequent (f30%) in soft-tissue sarcomas (1). Moreover, it has been
shown that among p53-wt cancer cell lines, those that overexpress
MDM2 are the most sensitive to nutlin-3a treatment (49). This
observation has been interpreted as evidence that the overexpression of MDM2 is the only alteration in the p53 pathway of

these cells, leaving intact other signaling cascades both upstream
and downstream of p53 (49). Determination of the status of
MDM2 and p53 is necessary to predict the response of tumors to
nutlin-based chemotherapy. In summary, it is reasonable to
speculate that tumor senescence may play an important role in
the chemotherapy of soft-tissue tumors with MDM2 antagonists
like nutlin-3a.
