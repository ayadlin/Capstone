BACKGROUND: Aldoxorubicin, a prodrug of doxorubicin, covalently binds to serum albumin, allowing for the administration of much
higher doses of doxorubicin in a previous clinical study. The current phase 1B/2 study evaluated the safety of aldoxorubicin, including
preliminary efficacy and safety of its maximum tolerated dose (MTD). METHODS: Patients aged 18 to 70 years with recurrent/refractory malignant solid tumors received aldoxorubicin at a dose of 230 mg/m2, 350 mg/m2, or 450 mg/m2 (170 mg/m2, 260 mg/m2, or
335 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalents, respectively) by intravenous infusion once every 21 days for up to 8 consecutive cycles.
RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were enrolled, including 17 patients (68%) with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS). The MTD of
aldoxorubicin was 350 mg/m2; dose-limiting toxicities included grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 febrile neutropenia (NCI CTCAE
v4.0). Drug-related adverse events included myelosuppression, nausea, fatigue, alopecia, stomatitis, vomiting, and oropharyngeal
pain. No clinically significant cardiac toxicities were reported. Seven patients (28%) had elevated serum troponin levels while taking
part in the study, but these elevations were not clinically significant or associated with cardiac findings. A partial response was
achieved in 20% of patients, and stable disease was reported in 40% of patients. The median progression-free survival was 4.80
months, and the median overall survival was 11.25 months. Among patients with STS who were treated at the MTD (13 patients),
a partial response was achieved in 38% and stable disease in 46%; the median progression-free survival was 11.25 months and the median overall survival was 21.71 months. CONCLUSIONS: Aldoxorubicin at a dose of 350 mg/m2 administered once every 21 days for up
to 8 cycles was found to be acceptably safe and demonstrated preliminary efficacy in patients with advanced solid tumors, including

INTRODUCTION
An estimated 11,410 individuals in the United States were diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma in 2013.1 In 39% of newly
diagnosed cases, the cancer is found to have spread regionally (24%) or distally (15%), with corresponding 5-year relative
survival rates of 61% and 18%, respectively.2
Doxorubicin-based chemotherapy is a standard of care for patients with advanced, unresectable, or metastatic soft
tissue sarcoma.3 Although effective in the treatment of a variety of cancers, including advanced soft tissue sarcoma,4-8 the
advantages of doxorubicin monotherapy and dose-intensive, doxorubicin-based combination regimens are mitigated by
dose-related toxicities, particularly cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure.9,10 Even when the total cumulative dose
of doxorubicin is limited, late-onset cardiotoxicity has been observed.11,12 The administration of dexrazoxane may provide
cardioprotection in patients receiving cumulative doses of doxorubicin-based therapy of 300 mg/m2 but requires careful
observation.13 Consequently, high-dose or long-term treatment with doxorubicin is not generally feasible.
Aldoxorubicin is a prodrug of doxorubicin that is derivatized at its C-13 keto-position with a thiol-binding spacer
molecule (6-maleimidocaproic acid hydrazide) (Fig. 1A).14,15 When aldoxorubicin enters the bloodstream, this spacer

J Control Release. 2008;132:171-183.15 (B) The following are the steps involved in its mechanism of action. Step 1: aldoxorubicin (red
square with linker/spacer) is infused into the patient. Step 2: the maleimide spacer rapidly reacts with the thiol group of cysteine-34

of the tumor leads to cleavage of the hydrazine linker, thereby releasing the doxorubicin drug payload at the site of the tumor.

molecule rapidly and covalently binds to only the most reactive thiol group in human plasma, the cysteine-34
amino acid of endogenous albumin. The albumin-bound
doxorubicin is then carried to the tumor, and doxorubicin
is released in the acidic environment of the tumor via
cleavage of an acid-sensitive hydrazine bond between the
drug and the carrier (Fig. 1B).14,15

that of doxorubicin, and the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) of aldoxorubicin in dogs was 3 times that of
doxorubicin.16 Furthermore, the exposure of rats to
aldoxorubicin was associated with less clinical and histopathological evidence of cardiotoxicity compared with
equimolar dosing of doxorubicin,17 which might be
explained by other experiments demonstrating lower
accumulation of aldoxorubicin in organs, including the
heart, compared with native doxorubicin.15

Original Article

In a phase 1 study of aldoxorubicin in patients with
advanced solid tumors, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of
mucositis and neutropenia were observed at the MTD
(340 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalents) and at the recommended dose of 260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalents. It is
important to note that no clinical signs of cardiotoxicity
were observed, even among patients in the higher dose
groups. Partial remission was observed in 3 patients,
including 1 with a soft tissue sarcoma (liposarcoma) and 2
with solid organ tumors (small cell lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer, respectively).18
Since then, a new formulation of aldoxorubicin has
been developed. The current study evaluated the safety of
the new formulation of aldoxorubicin in an abbreviated
phase 1B/2 dose escalation study, as well as the preliminary
efficacy and safety of aldoxorubicin at its MTD in patients
with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who had developed disease progression while receiving prior chemotherapies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

The current study was a phase 1B, open-label study to
evaluate the safety of the new formulation of aldoxorubicin administered at doses of 230 mg/m2, 350 mg/m2, and
450 mg/m2 (170 mg/m2, 260 mg/m2, and 335 mg/m2
doxorubicin equivalents, respectively) by intravenous
infusion on day 1 of every 21-day cycle for a maximum of
6 consecutive cycles (later amended to 8 cycles). The new
formulation of aldoxorubicin no longer uses a bulking
agent or a viscosity-reducing agent. It also has fewer buffering agents and no longer needs pH adjustment or cold
storage at 5 C before infusion. The diluent was simplified
to a 50:50 mix of ethanol:water, the use of which allows a
2-hour window for reconstitution and drug delivery at
room temperature. The primary endpoint was to evaluate
treatment-related toxicities and determine the MTD, and
the secondary endpoint was to determine the objective
response rate (ORR) using version 1.1 of the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) after
treatment with aldoxorubicin. Escalation to the next dose
level occurred if fewer than 2 of 5 or fewer than 4 of 8
patients experienced a DLT (grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic
toxicity, excluding alopecia and nausea/vomiting; platelet
count <25,000 cells/mL or neutrophil count <500 cells/
mL lasting >7 days; and/or associated with a fever
>38.5 C) after completing cycle 1 and before starting
cycle 2 of study treatment. If at least 2 of 5 or at least 4 of
8 patients experienced a DLT, then 3 additional patients
were enrolled at that dose level. If 2 of the 3 additional
patients experienced a DLT, the previous dose level would
572

be defined as the MTD. After establishment of the MTD,
the MTD cohort was expanded to a total of 18 patients to
provide additional safety information. This study, clinical
trial identifier NCT01337505,19 was conducted in accordance with current US Food and Drug Administration
regulations, International Conference on Harmonisation
Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki, and other applicable regulations
and guidelines.
Patients

Patients were aged 18 to 70 years with malignant solid
tumors that had recurred or were refractory to standard
therapy; had stable brain metastases, if present on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans
during screening; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status of 0 to 2; had a life expectancy
>12 weeks; were not pregnant or lactating (women
patients only); had received no palliative surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or radiotherapy within 4
weeks of the screening visit, and had no exposure to any
investigational agent within 30 days of the screening visit;
had adequate liver and bone marrow function; had no clinically evident congestive heart failure worse than New York
Heart Association functional class II; had no serious, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, no history or signs of
active coronary artery disease, and no serious myocardial
dysfunction or left ventricular ejection fraction <45% of
predicted; had no active, clinically significant, serious infection, including human immunodeficiency virus, that
required treatment; and had undergone no major surgery
within 3 weeks of the first dose of the study drug. All
patients provided written informed consent.
Safety Assessments

At baseline and on day 1 of each cycle, safety monitoring
(including adverse events [AEs]), physical examination, serum chemistry (including troponin I), complete blood
count, urinalysis, and electrocardiography were performed.
Additional cardiac monitoring by echocardiography or
multigated acquisition scan was performed at baseline, on
days 28 and 85, and during the follow-up period. AEs were
graded using a descriptive scale within the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0.
Efficacy Assessments

At baseline, on days 28 and 85, and during the follow-up
period, tumor measurements were made. Objective
response was evaluated using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Measurable reductions in tumor dimensions from baseline values

response. Complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and a partial response (PR)
was defined as a 30% decrease from baseline in the sum
of the longest diameter of all target lesions and no new
lesions. After a PR or CR was confirmed, tumors were
measured every 3 months until the end of the study.
Statistical Analysis

Patients who had received at least 1 dose of the study drug
were included in the primary safety analyses. Patients who
had received at least 1 dose of study drug and had undergone at least 1 postdose tumor assessment were evaluable
for tumor response. ORR, as well as the rates of CR, PR,
stable disease (SD), and progressive disease, were estimated by the percentage of patients meeting the criteria
for each level of response. Kaplan-Meier analyses were
used to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

patients in the 350 mg/m2 dose group, which was later
expanded to a total of 18 patients (cohort 2); and 2
patients in the 450 mg/m2 dose group (cohort 3). One of
the 2 patients initially enrolled in cohort 3 completed 1
cycle at the 450 mg/m2 dose level and subsequently completed 7 cycles at the 350 mg/m2 dose level. The other
patient in this cohort was withdrawn from the study after
the first cycle because of liver failure secondary to disease.
Demographics and baseline characteristics of the
study patients are summarized in Table 1. Cohorts differed with regard to sex and racial demographic characteristics, but other patient and disease characteristics were
similar across cohorts. Seventeen patients (68%) had a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma, most commonly of the leiomyosarcoma histologic subtype (12 patients). Twentythree patients had received a median of 3 prior chemotherapy regimens (range, 1-7 regimens); of these, 12
patients (52%) had received prior doxorubicin, pegylated
liposomal doxorubicin, and/or epirubicin.

a
One patient initially received a dose of 450 mg/m2 in cycle 1 and subsequently received a dose of 350 mg/m2 in cycles 2 through 8.
b
Includes 1 death.

The median number of cycles completed was 4
cycles (range, 1-8 cycles) for the entire safety population.
For each cohort, the median number of cycles completed
was 2 cycles (range, 2-5 cycles) in cohort 1, 6 cycles
(range, 1-8 cycles) in cohort 2, and 1 cycle in cohort 3.
Patients with soft tissue sarcoma in cohort 2 (13 patients)
completed a median of 8 cycles (range, 2-8 cycles).
No DLT was observed in cohort 1. Of the first 6
patients enrolled in cohort 2, 1 patient experienced DLTs
(dehydration, sepsis, and neutropenia). The first 2
patients in cohort 3 experienced DLTs (grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 febrile neutropenia), and the principal investigator deemed it unsafe to enter more patients at this
dose level. The MTD was determined to be 350 mg/m2
(or 260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalents).
A summary of study drug-related treatment-emergent
AEs (TEAEs) is shown in Table 2, and the incidences of
study drug-related TEAEs are shown in Table 3. Myelosuppression (mostly grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, mostly grade 1-3
thrombocytopenia, and mostly grade 1 or 2 anemia) was the
most common study drug-related AE observed during treatment. Fatigue, alopecia, gastrointestinal-related events (nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, constipation, and
gastroesophageal reflux disease), and stomatitis-related events
(mouth ulcerations, oral pain, and oropharyngeal pain) were
common study drug-related, nonhematologic AEs. These
nonhematologic AEs were mostly grade 1 or 2 in severity.
A total of 6 patients (1 patient in cohort 1, 4 patients in
cohort 2, and 1 patient in cohort 3) discontinued the study
drug because of a TEAE. For 2 of these patients (both of
whom were in cohort 2), the TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation (grade 2 hypophosphatemia and grade 2 pyelonephritis and grade 3 fatigue, respectively) were not
considered by the investigator to be causally related to the
study drug. For the other 4 patients (1 patient in cohort 1, 2
patients in cohort 2, and 1 patient in cohort 3), the TEAEs
574

leading to discontinuation (grade 3 fatigue, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, grade 5 septic shock, and grade 3 anemia and grade
3 neutropenia, respectively) were considered by the investigator to be causally related to the study drug. The patient who
experienced septic shock as a TEAE had received 1 dose of
the study drug in cohort 2. This patient died, and the cause of
death was listed as severe sepsis, septic shock secondary to urinary tract infection, and severe neutropenia. It should be
noted that this patient had been hospitalized with sepsis and a
urinary tract infection just 5 days before study enrollment.
Cardiac Safety Evaluations

A comparison of echocardiographic parameters at the time
of screening and study completion revealed no clinically significant changes in any cohort for any echocardiographic parameter over the course of the study. Cardiac safety
evaluations demonstrated that no patients experienced a
decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction <45% of predicted. One patient in the group treated with a dose of
450 mg/m2 experienced a prolongation in the QTc interval
to >500 milliseconds but was withdrawn from the study after the first cycle because of liver failure secondary to disease.
Seven patients (28%) had elevated serum troponin levels
(0.016 ng/mL or 1.5 times the upper limit of normal)
at 1 or more time points during the study, including 1
patient with elevated levels at the time of screening but not
during the study, and 6 with elevated levels (range, 0.0160.30 ng/mL) during the study. All incidences of increased
serum troponin observed during the study either were
deemed not clinically significant (5 times the upper limit
of normal) or were not assessed for clinical significance.
Tumor Response Evaluations

Best overall responses in the total population are summarized in Table 4. The overall response rate was 20%,

Septic shock that resulted in death (grade 5) occurred in one patient.

patient in cohort 3 who had a PR achieved this response
after 1 cycle at a dose of 450 mg/m2 and 5 cycles at the
dose level of 350 mg/m2. The median PFS for the total
population was 4.80 months (Fig. 2A), and the median
OS was 11.25 months (Fig. 2B).
Best responses for the 13 patients with soft tissue sarcoma in cohort 2 who received aldoxorubicin at the MTD
are summarized in Table 5 and Figure 3. Twelve of these
13 patients had received prior chemotherapy, including 7
patients who had received prior doxorubicin, epirubicin,
and/or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and had experienced either no response or disease progression on prior
therapy. Of 8 patients with evidence of tumor shrinkage
while receiving aldoxorubicin, 5 had exhibited no objective response to prior anthracycline therapy (Fig. 3). During treatment with aldoxorubicin, 9 of the 13 patients had
achieved either a PR or SD lasting at least 4 months. For
these 13 patients, the median PFS was 11.25 months (Fig.
2C) and the median OS was 21.71 months (Fig. 2D).
DISCUSSION
This phase 1B/2 study of a modified formulation of
aldoxorubicin in patients with advanced solid tumors
Cancer

February 15, 2015

established the MTD of aldoxorubicin as 350 mg/m2
(equivalent to 260 mg/m2 doxorubicin) administered every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles. At this dose and administration schedule of aldoxorubicin, cumulative doses of
>2000 mg/m2 of doxorubicin equivalents have been
achieved, which is >3.5 times the peak cumulative dose of
standard doxorubicin, with no evidence of clinically significant acute cardiac abnormalities. These observations
suggest that therapy with aldoxorubicin could allow for
much higher doxorubicin dose equivalents to be used in
the treatment of patients with cancer, either alone or as
part of high-dose chemotherapy combinations, without a
commensurate increase in acute cardiotoxicity. To the
best of our knowledge, the longer-term effects of aldoxorubicin on cardiotoxicity are unknown at this time.
Major grade 3/4 hematologic AEs reported with
aldoxorubicin dosing included neutropenia and thrombocytopenia that generally resolved before the start of the
next cycle. We hypothesize that the high frequency of hematologic AEs may be attributable to the release of doxorubicin from aldoxorubicin in the relatively acidic
environment of the bone marrow, although the current
study was not designed to examine that hypothesis.

at a dose of 350 mg/m2 (maximum tolerated dose; 13 patients). Asterisk indicates those patients who had received prior therapy
with doxorubicin, epirubicin, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.

Frequent nonhematologic AEs included nausea, fatigue,
alopecia, stomatitis, vomiting, and oropharyngeal pain.
The majority of study drug-related, nonhematologic
TEAEs occurring in any cohort were mild to moderate in
severity (grade 1/2). Compared with native doxorubicin,
treatment with aldoxorubicin did not result in any unexpected AEs. It is of considerable importance to note that
no clinically significant cardiac toxicities were observed
with aldoxorubicin treatment in the current study. Safety

All 25 patients in the current study were evaluable
for tumor response. Among the total population, the
ORR was 20%, the SD rate was 40%, and the overall disease control rate was 60%. Among patients with soft tissue
sarcoma who were treated in cohort 2 at the MTD (13
patients), the ORR was 38% and the SD rate was 46%.
Of these 13 patients, 9 (69%) had a PR or SD lasting 4

cohort of patients with soft tissue sarcoma. The preliminary efficacy of aldoxorubicin shown in the current study
in patients with soft tissue sarcoma, the majority of whom
had either failed to respond or developed disease recurrence after prior chemotherapies, exceeded prior efficacy
findings of single-agent anthracycline in similar populations, in which response rates have been reported to range
from 12% to 23%.20-22 However, it should be noted that
the current study involved only a single site.
Targeted delivery of anticancer agents is a highly
sought-after goal of cancer therapy. Albumin is viewed as
a tumor-selective drug carrier because serum albumin
accumulates in tumor tissue,23 possibly as a source of
energy and nutrition for tumor growth.24 The pathophysiology of tumor tissue, characterized by hypervascularization, enhanced vascular permeability, and impaired
lymphatic drainage, allows macromolecules such as serum
albumin to accumulate passively in tumor tissue and
become retained.
Nanoparticle albumin-bound (“nab”) technology
has already proven effective as a means to deliver chemotherapeutic agents. For example, nab-paclitaxel, which is
currently approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer, locally advanced or metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer, and metastatic pancreatic cancer,25
can be administered at an MTD of 300 mg/m2, which is
approximately twice the usual dose range of paclitaxel
(135-200 mg/m2).26 Although nab-chemotherapy can be
effective, the use of circulating albumin as a drug carrier
may have certain advantages over synthesized drugalbumin conjugates or complexes.15 First, this precludes
the need for commercial albumin, which may keep the
cost of drug manufacturing relatively lower. Second,
aldoxorubicin binds covalently to albumin in the bloodstream and is not released unless in an acidic environment.
In contrast, albumin in nab-chemotherapy is not covalently linked to nanoparticles and can dissociate at the
time of infusion. Third, the organic chemistry principles
applied to generate albumin-binding drugs are straightforward, thereby highlighting the potential to apply these
principles to generate albumin-binding versions of an
array of drugs. Finally, the pharmaceutical products of
albumin-binding drugs can be analyzed with comparable
ease.
The results of the current study have demonstrated
that aldoxorubicin is reasonably safe when administered
at a dose of 350 mg/m2 as a 30-minute intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to 8 consecutive
cycles. Aldoxorubicin is currently under investigation in
larger, prospectively designed clinical studies, particularly
578

those involving patients with soft tissue sarcoma or other
anthracycline-sensitive cancers.
