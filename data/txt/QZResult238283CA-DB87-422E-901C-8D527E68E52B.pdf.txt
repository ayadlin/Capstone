Abstract

Introduction

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been posited as a
potential anticancer target. The synthetic antitumor alkyllysophospholipid analogue edelfosine accumulates in the ER
of solid tumor cells. This ER accumulation of the drug leads
to the inhibition of phosphatidylcholine and protein
synthesis, G2-M arrest, depletion of ER-stored Ca2+, Bax
up-regulation and activation, transcriptional factor growth
arrest and DNA damage–inducible gene 153 up-regulation,
caspase-4 and caspase-8 activation, and eventually to
apoptosis. Edelfosine prompted ER stress apoptotic signaling, but not the survival unfolded protein response.
Edelfosine also induced persistent c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinase (JNK) activation. Gene transfer–mediated overexpression of apoptosis signal–regulating kinase 1, which
plays a crucial role in ER stress, enhanced edelfosineinduced JNK activation and apoptosis. Inhibition of JNK,
caspase-4, or caspase-8 activation diminished edelfosineinduced apoptosis. Edelfosine treatment led to the generation of the p20 caspase-8 cleavage fragment of BAP31,
directing proapoptotic signals between the ER and the
mitochondria. bax / bak / double-knockout cells fail to
undergo edelfosine-induced ER-stored Ca2+ release and
apoptosis. Wild-type and bax / bak / cells showed similar
patterns of phosphatidylcholine and protein synthesis
inhibition, despite their differences in drug sensitivity.
Thus, edelfosine-induced apoptosis is dependent on Bax/
Bak-mediated ER-stored Ca2+ release, but phosphatidylcholine and protein synthesis inhibition is not critical.
Transfection-enforced expression of Bcl-XL, which localizes
specifically in mitochondria, prevented apoptosis without
inhibiting ER-stored Ca2+ release. These data reveal that
edelfosine induces an ER stress response in solid tumor
cells, providing novel insights into the edelfosine-mediated
antitumor activity. Our data also indicate that mitochondria are indispensable for this edelfosine-induced cell death
initiated by ER stress. [Cancer Res 2007;67(21):10368–78]

Synthetic alkyl-lysophospholipid analogues (ALP), from which
1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET-18OCH3, edelfosine) is their prototypic compound, represent a
promising class of oral anticancer drugs that do not target the
DNA (1–3). Recent in vitro and in vivo data (4, 5) have prompted
renewed interest in the study of their antitumor properties and
underlying mechanisms. The antitumor action of edelfosine relies
on its ability to induce apoptosis in a wide spectrum of tumor cells
(1, 6), involving c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) persistent
activation (7) and mitochondria (8). Edelfosine induces a rapid
apoptotic response in leukemic cells through coclustering of Fas/
CD95 death receptor and lipid rafts, independently of Fas/CD95
ligand (5, 9, 10). Edelfosine targets mainly lipid rafts in hematologic
malignancies and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in solid tumor
cells (10, 11), hence showing different targets in distinct tumor cell
types.
ER has been recently shown to modulate cell death. When the
functions of the ER are severely impaired, the organism protects
itself by getting rid of the damaged cells through apoptosis. ER is
composed of a system of connected membranous tubules and
vesicles along which protein and phospholipid synthesis occur and
intracellular calcium levels are regulated. Thus, disruption in Ca2+
homeostasis, inhibition of protein glycosylation, accumulation of
misfolded proteins, and inhibition of phosphatidylcholine could all
challenge the function of the ER-Golgi network resulting in ER
stress, and excessive ER stress leads to apoptosis (12, 13). The ER
stress response includes: induction of the transcription factor
CCAAT/enhancer binding protein–homologous protein (CHOP),
a.k.a. growth arrest and DNA damage–inducible gene 153
(GADD153), activation of JNK through the apoptosis signal–
regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), and activation of the ER-localized
caspase-12 in murine systems or caspase-4 in human cells (12–15).
Some anticancer chemotherapeutic agents have been shown to
induce ER stress, including the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
(16), the Hsp90 inhibitors, geldanamycin and 17-allyl-aminogeldanamycin (17), cisplatin (18), and cannabinoids (19). However,
these agents target ER-mediated processes rather than the ER
itself, leading indirectly to ER stress. We have recently found that
edelfosine accumulates predominantly at the ER in a number of
solid tumor cells (11). Now, we report here that the accumulation
of edelfosine at the ER of solid tumor cells alters ER functions,
leading to ER stress and eventually to apoptosis.

inhibitor SP600125 were from Calbiochem. Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester
( fura-2/AM) was from Molecular Probes. Cycloheximide, tunicamycin, and
histamine were from Sigma.
Cell culture and bcl-xL transfection. Human cells were grown in
DMEM (HeLa) or RPMI 1640 (A549) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FCS, 2 mmol/L of L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and
100 Ag/mL of streptomycin at 37jC in 5% CO2 humidified air. HeLa cells
(1–2  105) were transfected with 2 Ag of pSFFV-bcl-xL or pSFFV-Neo
expression vector (1), using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies). Transfected clones were selected by growth in the presence of 500 Ag/mL of G418
(Sigma) and monitored by Western blotting using the 2H12 anti–
29 kDa Bcl-XL monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences PharMingen).
Wild-type and bax / bak / double-knockout (DKO) SV40-transformed
mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), as well as single knockout bax / or bak /
MEFs, kindly provided by S.J. Korsmeyer (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
Boston, MA; ref. 20), were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS,
2 mmol/L of L-glutamine, 0.1 mmol/L of nonessential amino acids, 50 Amol/L of
h-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL of streptomycin.
ASK1 transfection. HeLa cells (5  105) were seeded and transfected
with 6 Ag of ASK1 wild-type (pcDNA3.1-ASK1), kindly provided by H. Ichijo
(University of Tokyo, Japan), or with empty pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen),
using the cationic polymer transfection reagent jetPEI (Qbiogene). Transfected clones were selected by growth in the presence of 500 Ag/mL of G418
and monitored by Western blotting using an anti–155 kDa ASK1 rabbit
polyclonal antibody (dilution 1:500; eBioscience).
Apoptosis and cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle analysis and quantitation
of apoptotic cells (hypodiploidy) were determined by flow cytometry as
previously described (21).
Phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Cells (2–3  106) were washed with
PBS and incubated with 1 ACi/mL of [methyl-14C]choline chloride
(Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min in FCS-free culture medium. Labeled
cells were washed thrice with PBS, resuspended in the presence or absence
of edelfosine in complete culture medium for the indicated times, and
analyzed for phosphatidylcholine synthesis as described previously (11).
Radioactive lipids were visualized using a Fujifilm BAS-MS PhosphorImager
and identified using internal controls. Spots corresponding to labeled
phosphatidylcholine were quantitated by laser densitometry.
Protein synthesis. Cells (2–2.5  106) were washed with PBS and
incubated in FCS- and methionine-free medium for 15 to 20 min. Before
labeling with 0.5 ACi/mL of [35S]methionine (Amersham) for the indicated
times, cells were incubated in the absence (negative control) or presence of
10 Amol/L of edelfosine or 75 Amol/L of cycloheximide (positive control).
After one wash with PBS/2% bovine serum albumin and twice with PBS,
cells were lysed in 25 mmol/L of Hepes (pH 7.7), 0.3 mol/L of NaCl,
1.5 mmol/L of MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/L of EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mmol/L of
h-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mmol/L of sodium orthovanadate for 20 to
30 min at 4jC. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. After
centrifugation, samples were resuspended in 100 AL of Tris-HCl at 0.5 mol/L
(pH 9.0), and radioactivity incorporation into precipitated proteins was
measured with a scintillation counter.
RT-PCR. Five micrograms of total RNA was primed with random
hexamers and reverse-transcribed with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen) in a 20 AL volume. The generated cDNA was amplified by using
primers for human gadd153/chop ( forward 5¶-CATTGCCTTTCTCTTCGGAC-3¶ and reverse 5¶-GCCACTTTCCTTTCATTCTCC-3¶), and b-actin
( forward 5¶-CTGTCTGGCGGCACCACCAT-3¶ and reverse 5¶-GCAACTAAGTCATAGTCCGC-3¶). The PCR profile was as follows: 95jC for 30 s; 56jC
(gadd153/chop) or 65jC (b-actin) for 30 s; 72jC for 90 s. After 30 cycles,
shown to be at the linear phase of amplification, the expected PCR products
(379 bp for gadd153/chop, and 254 bp for b-actin) were size-fractionated
onto 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.
Solid phase JNK assay. A fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase
and c-Jun (amino acids 1–223) was used as a substrate for JNK activity as
described previously (22).
Western blot. Cells (4–5  106) were lysed with 60 AL of 25 mmol/L
Hepes (pH 7.7), 0.3 mol/L of NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L of MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/L of

EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mmol/L of h-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmol/L of
sodium orthovanadate supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 Ag/mL aprotinin, 20 Ag/mL leupeptin).
Fifty micrograms of proteins were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels,
transferred to nitrocellulose filters, blocked with 5% (w/v) power defatted
milk in TBST [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.1%
Tween 20] for 90 min at room temperature, and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature or overnight at 4jC with specific antibodies: R-20 anti–30 kDa
CHOP/GADD153 (1:250 dilution) and H-129 anti–78 kDa Grp78/BiP (1:500
dilution) rabbit polyclonal antibodies, N-15 anti–50 kDa caspase-4 (1:250
dilution) goat polyclonal antibody that also detects the p20 subunit, C-20
anti–55 kDa caspase-8 (1:500 dilution) goat polyclonal antibody that also
recognizes the p20 subunit, C-15 anti–28 kDa BAP31 (1:500 dilution) goat
polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); CM1 anti–18 kDa active
caspase-3 (1:5,000 dilution) rabbit polyclonal antibody, and 2H12 anti–29
kDa Bcl-XL (1:500 dilution), 6A7 anti–21 kDa Bax (1:500 dilution), and G3172 anti–24 kDa Bak (1:500 dilution) monoclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences
PharMingen); AC-15 anti–42 kDa h-actin (1:5,000 dilution) monoclonal
antibody (Sigma); and anti–40 kDa eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF2a;
1:1,000 dilution) rabbit polyclonal antibody and 119A11 anti–40 kDa
phosphorylated eIF2a (Ser51; 1:1,000 dilution) rabbit monoclonal antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology). Signals were developed using an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham).
Flow cytometry detection of intracellular proteins. Cells were fixed
and permeabilized by means of the Fix & Perm cell permeabilization kit
(CALTAG Laboratories) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells
were then incubated with monoclonal antibodies against the active forms of
Bax (clone 6A7; BD Biosciences PharMingen) and Bak (clone Ab-1;
Calbiochem) at 1:50 dilution in PBS for 15 min at room temperature,
washed with PBS, stained for 15 min with Cy2-conjugated antimouse IgG at
1:50 dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), and analyzed in
a Becton Dickinson fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)Calibur flow
cytometer. Data are shown as the mean fluorescence intensity, which was
corrected for unspecific staining by subtracting the fluorescence of cells
stained with negative controls. P3X63 myeloma culture supernatant, kindly
provided by F. Sánchez-Madrid (Hospital de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain),
and an isotype-matched nonrelevant IgG monoclonal antibody were used as
negative controls, leading to virtually identical background values.
Single cell calcium measurement. Cells were loaded with the cellpermeable fura-2/AM by incubation in standard medium (145 mmol/L
NaCl, 5 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L CaCl2, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L Hepes;
pH 7.4) for 40 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with
standard medium for 10 min at room temperature and mounted in a cell
chamber on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope under continuous
perfusion. Single cell fluorescence was excited at 340 and 380 nm using a
Cairn monochromator (100 ms excitation at each wavelength every 2 s) and
images of the fluorescence emitted above 500 nm obtained with a 40 Fluar
objective were recorded by a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (Hamamatsu,
Japan). Single cell fluorescence records were rationed and calibrated into
cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration values off-line as described previously
(23) using Metafluor program (Universal Imaging). Experiments were done
at 37jC using an on-line heater from Harvar Apparatus. Cells were perfused
with standard medium containing 1 mmol/L of CaCl2 or with Ca2+-lacking
medium (0 mmol/L Ca2+) that contained 0.5 mmol/L of EGTA in
substitution of Ca2+. Edelfosine and histamine were added to the perfusion
medium at the indicated final concentrations from stock solutions. Aqueous
stock solutions of 10 and 1 mmol/L edelfosine were used. Different
solutions were changed by means of a multichannel perfusion system.

Results
Edelfosine inhibits phosphatidylcholine and protein synthesis. We have recently found that the edelfosine fluorescent
analogue PTE-edelfosine, which has been previously shown to
preserve the apoptotic features of the parental edelfosine in a
number of different cell types, is located in the ER of distinct
cancer cell lines derived from human malignant solid tumors,

ER Stress in Edelfosine Antitumor Action

including human cervix epitheloid carcinoma HeLa and human
lung carcinoma A549 cells (11). Owing to the accumulation of
edelfosine in the ER, we investigated whether an alteration in ER
homeostasis could be involved in the antitumor action of this drug.
Edelfosine induced apoptosis in HeLa and A549 cells after a
rather long incubation time following a cell cycle arrest in G2-M
(Fig. 1A). Because ER is responsible for the synthesis of proteins
and lipids, we first analyzed the effect of the drug on both
phosphatidylcholine and protein synthesis. Cells were incubated
with [14C]choline for 30 min, followed by exhaustive washing, and
incubation in the absence or presence of edelfosine for different

times, thus avoiding any effects that edelfosine might have on
the uptake of choline into the cells (24). We found that edelfosine
inhibited [14C]choline incorporation into the phosphatidylcholine
pool in both HeLa and A549 cells (Fig. 1B). These results are
in agreement with previous studies showing inhibition of
phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis by this drug at the phosphocholine cytdilyltransferase (CCT) step (25). Edelfosine also inhibited
protein synthesis in both HeLa and A549 cells (Fig. 1C).
Cycloheximide, used at a concentration that prevented protein
synthesis (Fig. 1C), induced a slight apoptotic response which
was increased following its combination with edelfosine

Figure 2. ER stress in edelfosine-treated HeLa cells. A, top, cells were untreated (C ) or treated with 10 Amol/L edelfosine for the indicated times and chop/gadd153
gene expression was assessed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Cells treated with 25 Amol/L of tunicamycin (Tm ) for 3 h were used as a positive control. PCR amplification

or 100 Amol/L of z-IETD-fmk for 1 h, and then incubated in the absence or presence of 10 Amol/L of edelfosine (EDLF ) for 24 h, and analyzed by flow cytometry
to evaluate apoptosis (top ) or by immunoblotting using specific antibodies (bottom ). Untreated control cells (CONT ) were run in parallel. C, cells untreated (C ) or
treated with 10 Amol/L of edelfosine for the indicated times were analyzed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies for the indicated proteins. D, conformational
changes in Bax and Bak were determined as described in Materials and Methods in untreated control cells and following treatment with 10 Amol/L of edelfosine for
the indicated times. h-Actin was used as a loading control in Western blot analyses. B (top ) and D, columns, means; bars, SE (n = 3). Blots are representative of

then incubated in the absence or presence of 10 Amol/L of edelfosine (EDLF ) for 16 h, and analyzed for apoptosis and JNK activation. The migration position of
GST-c-Jun-1-223 is indicated. Untreated control cells (C ) were run in parallel. Columns, means; bars, SE (n = 3). B, ASK1 protein expression was analyzed by

of edelfosine for different times and assayed for JNK activation. The migration position of GST-c-Jun-1-223 is indicated. Representative of three experiments. D,
cells were treated with 10 Amol/L of edelfosine (EDLF ) for 24 h and analyzed for apoptosis. Untreated control cells (Cont ) were run in parallel. Columns, means; bars,

(Supplementary Fig. S1). Edelfosine induced the phosphorylation of
eIF2a (Fig. 1C, right), thereby mediating translational repression
(26). Protein synthesis inhibition prevents the constant accumulation of newly synthesized proteins into the ER when ER itself
and/or protein folding conditions are compromised. Our data
indicate that edelfosine affects both phospholipid and protein
homeostasis.
Edelfosine induces the release of ER-stored Ca2+. Because ER
is the main Ca2+ cellular store, we analyzed the effect of edelfosine
on ER calcium release. Treatment of HeLa cells with edelfosine for
15 min reduced histamine-induced calcium release from intracellular stores by f45% (integral of calcium wave; Fig. 1D, left). A 60min pretreatment with edelfosine completely prevented histamineinduced Ca2+ release (Fig. 1D), indicating that the ER-Ca2+ stores
had been depleted during drug treatment. Short drug treatments
(V15 min) were carried out in the microscope chamber while
recording calcium changes (upper and medium records) in Ca2+free (0 Ca2+) medium containing 0.5 mmol/L of EGTA to prevent
any possible effect of edelfosine on calcium entry. Some experiments were done in the presence of 0.2 mmol/L of Mn2+ as a
calcium surrogate rendering identical results (data not shown),
thus, ruling out calcium entry in these conditions. When we did
longer drug treatments (>30 min), cells were incubated in standard
medium with 10 Amol/L of edelfosine to avoid Ca2+ store depletion
due to protracted incubations in 0 Ca2+ medium. Then, cells were
mounted in the microscope chamber to measure cytosolic Ca2+ as
above. In these cases, cells were initially perfused with standard
medium, and then with 0 Ca2+ medium to stimulate the cells with
histamine (Fig. 1D, bottom left). We also observed a small increase
in the cytosolic calcium baseline with long drug pretreatments, 15
to 60 min (Fig. 1D, left; data not shown), indicating that Ca2+ stores

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

are being emptied. In time course assays, we found that edelfosine
caused a gradual calcium discharge from the ER up to its total
depletion in HeLa cells. In Fig. 1D (right), we represent the
amplitude of the calcium peak with histamine as cytoplasmic-free
Ca2+ concentration (nmol/L) versus the time of edelfosine
treatment, showing an exponential decay of histamine-induced
calcium release when drug incubation times are increased. These
data indicate that edelfosine affects Ca2+ homeostasis.
Edelfosine induces ER stress. We next examined the effects of
edelfosine on a number of ER stress–associated markers. RT-PCR
and immunoblotting analyses showed that edelfosine induced the
expression of transcription factor CHOP/GADD153 at both mRNA
and protein levels (Fig. 2A). The N-glycosylation inhibitor
tunicamycin was used as a positive control for ER stress (27).
Because ER is not only responsible for protein synthesis, but also
for initial posttranslational protein modification, folding and
export, disturbances in the ER lead to the accumulation of
misfolded proteins. Cells trigger a specific survival signaling in
response to ER stress, known as the unfolded protein response
(UPR; ref. 13), which mainly involves the expression of Grp78/BiP
chaperone, trying to enhance the ER protein folding capacity.
Edelfosine did not up-regulate Grp78/BiP (Fig. 2A). Thus, these
results suggest that edelfosine induces an apoptotic signal without
unleashing the typical UPR. In this regard, inhibition of phosphatidylcholine synthesis has been reported to induce CHOP/
GADD153 without any change in Grp78/BiP protein levels (28).
Caspase-12 mediates ER stress–induced apoptosis in murine
cells, but human cells do not possess a functional caspase-12 gene
(29). Because human caspase-4 is a potential homologue of murine
caspase-12, we analyzed whether caspase-4 was involved in
edelfosine-induced cell death. Caspase-4 was cleaved to its active

form in HeLa cells following protracted incubation times with
edelfosine and after the triggering of apoptosis (see Figs. 1A and
2A). However, caspase-8 and caspase-3 were activated before the
onset of the apoptotic response (Fig. 2A). BAP31, an integral
membrane protein of the ER that is a caspase-8 substrate (30),
was cleaved into a p20 fragment following edelfosine treatment

(Fig. 2A). The p20-BAP31 protein has been shown to direct
proapoptotic signals between ER and mitochondria (31).
We also found that preincubation of HeLa cells with the
caspase-4 inhibitor z-LEVD-fmk and the caspase-8 inhibitor zIETD-fmk diminished edelfosine-induced apoptosis by 42% and
65%, respectively (Fig. 2B, top), when used at concentrations that

prevented caspase activation (Fig. 2B, bottom). Caspase-8 inhibition
almost completely abrogated the p20-BAP31 fragment generation
(Fig. 2B, bottom right). Our data suggest that caspase-4 contributes
to the apoptotic response mediated by ER, but it does not
participate in the early triggering of apoptosis signaling.
ER stress has been shown to induce the activation of Bax and
Bak leading to conformational changes that expose previously NH2

(32). Activation of these proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members can be
detected by using anti-Bax (clone 6A7) and anti-Bak (clone Ab-1)
monoclonal antibodies that recognize the NH2-terminal epitopes of
human Bax and Bak, respectively, and thereby their corresponding
active forms. These antibodies have been previously used to show
the activation of Bax and Bak in response to distinct apoptotic
stimuli (32, 33). Interestingly, edelfosine treatment induced an
increase in the Bax protein expression level, without affecting the

protein levels of Bak and of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member
Bcl-XL (Fig. 2C). We also found that treatment of HeLa cells with
edelfosine promoted a significant activation of Bax, whereas Bak
was weakly activated (Fig. 2D).
ASK1-mediated JNK activation in edelfosine-induced apoptosis. Previous studies indicate that ASK1-mediated JNK
activation is crucial for ER-induced apoptosis (14). Edelfosine
has been reported to induce persistent JNK activation before the
onset of apoptosis (7). Pretreatment of HeLa cells with the
specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 reduced edelfosine-induced JNK
activation and apoptosis (Fig. 3A). We stably transfected HeLa
cells with wild-type ASK1 (Fig. 3B) and found that ASK1
overexpression enhanced edelfosine-induced JNK activation
(Fig. 3C) and cell death (Fig. 3D). These data are in concordance
with the notion that ASK1/JNK signaling is involved in ER stress–
induced apoptosis.
Absence of Bax and Bak inhibits edelfosine-induced
apoptosis. Although the function of Bcl-2 family proteins is best
characterized at the mitochondrion, some of these proteins also
localize to the ER affecting its membrane permeability and
regulating apoptosis (32). ER stress responses induce conformational changes and oligomerization of Bax and Bak on the ER,
initiating apoptosis (32), and bax / bak / DKO MEFs are
resistant to ER stress–mediated apoptosis (20). DKO cells were
completely resistant to edelfosine even when used at high
concentrations (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S2A and B) and
showed an accumulation of cells in G2-M phase following
edelfosine treatment (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S2B). Edelfosine
induced apoptosis at a similar extent in wild-type MEFs and MEFs
individually deficient in either Bax or Bak, requiring the absence of
both Bax and Bak to prevent cell death (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
This is in agreement with the redundant roles of Bax and Bak on
apoptosis, entailing the knockdown of both proteins to abrogate
ER stress–mediated apoptosis (34).
Phosphatidylcholine was weakly and similarly inhibited in either
wild-type or DKO cells (Fig. 4B). Edelfosine inhibited protein
biosynthesis in both wild-type and DKO cells (Fig. 4C). These data
suggest that inhibition of phosphatidylcholine and protein
biosynthesis is not critical for the apoptotic response triggered
by edelfosine.
Overexpression of Bax and Bak promotes Ca2+ mobilization from
the ER to the mitochondria during apoptosis (35). Bax and Bak
have been shown to alter Ca2+ homeostasis in response to ER stress
(34). On these grounds, we analyzed the ER-stored Ca2+ depletion
in wild-type versus DKO cells following edelfosine treatment. We
found that incubation of wild-type MEFs with edelfosine led to an
almost total depletion of ER-stored Ca2+ after 15 min of incubation
(Fig. 4D, left). Cells were perfused with 0 Ca2+ medium containing
1 Amol/L of edelfosine and then stimulated with 100 Amol/L of
histamine. Calcium release in this condition was 73% smaller than
in control edelfosine-free conditions. Edelfosine was used at
1 Amol/L because MEFs were detached at higher drug concentrations. Calcium was gradually increased in the cytosol, being
slowly released from the Ca2+ stores upon edelfosine incubation
(see inset in Fig. 4D, left). However, the absence of Bax and Bak in
DKO cells blocked edelfosine-induced ER-stored Ca2+ depletion,
and thereby, Ca2+ could be released by histamine (Fig. 4D, right).
Edelfosine failed to promote Ca2+ release in DKO cells even after 60
min of incubation (data not shown). These data suggest that
edelfosine-induced apoptosis is dependent on Bax/Bak-mediated
Ca2+ release from ER.

Bcl-XL overexpression protects cells from edelfosineinduced apoptosis. To study the role of mitochondria in edelfosine-induced cell death, we stably transfected HeLa cells with the
expression vector pSFFV-bcl-xL , containing the human bcl-xL open
reading frame, or with control pSFFV-Neo plasmid. HeLa cells
transfected with the pSFFV-Neo plasmid behaved similarly to wildtype HeLa cells (data not shown). HeLa cells expressed endogenous
Bcl-XL, but Western blot analysis showed a much higher expression
of Bcl-XL protein in bcl-xL –transfected HeLa cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Gene transfer–mediated overexpression of Bcl-XL
prevented apoptosis in edelfosine-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 5A).
Bcl-XL–transfected HeLa cells were accumulated in the G2-M phase
following edelfosine treatment (Fig. 5A), and after 4 days of
incubation, most of the cells were arrested in G2-M phase without
induction of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Edelfosine
inhibited both phosphatidylcholine and protein synthesis in BclXL–transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 5B and C), similarly to wild-type
HeLa cells (Fig. 1B and C). Edelfosine caused a total calcium
discharge from the ER of Bcl-XL–transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 5D),
an effect that is similar to that observed in wild-type HeLa cells
(Fig. 1D). The middle and bottom traces of Fig. 5D show that the
basal calcium levels are higher in edelfosine-treated cells than in
untreated control cells (300 versus 100 nmol/L Ca2+), which is
compatible with Ca2+ being released from the ER. Because Bcl-XL
protein specifically localizes and acts on mitochondria (36), our
results suggest that the apoptotic signals triggered by edelfosine at
the ER converge on the mitochondria.

Discussion
Here, we report for the first time that the ALP prototype
edelfosine affects ER functions which lead to ER stress and
apoptosis in human solid tumor cells. Edelfosine promotes a
number of changes in ER-regulated homeostatic processes leading
to the triggering of sundry ER-derived apoptotic events that
eventually converge on the mitochondria.
Edelfosine inhibits phosphatidylcholine synthesis in solid tumor
cells. Previous reports have shown that phosphatidylcholine
biosynthesis is blocked by edelfosine through the inhibition of
CCT (25). CCT catalyzes the rate-limiting step in de novo
phosphatidylcholine synthesis in higher animal cells, and its
activity is modulated by the stored curvature strain energy in lipid
membranes (37). Class II lipids, like diacylglycerol and unsaturated
phosphatidylethanolamines, tend to form aggregates in which the
polar/apolar interface bends toward the polar environment leading
to a curvature disposition. The flattening of these lipids at the cell
membrane leads to a stored curvature elastic strain that is released
by the partitioning of CCT into the membrane, and thereby, class II
lipids activate CCT. By contrast, class I lipids, such as ALPs, are
characterized by their ability to form aggregates in which the
polar/apolar interface curves away from the polar region and
inhibit CCT (37, 38). However, the similar patterns of phosphatidylcholine inhibition observed in both sensitive HeLa cells and
drug-resistant Bcl-XL–transfected cells as well as in wild-type and
drug-resistant bax / bak / DKO cells suggest that phosphatidylcholine inhibition is not essential for the apoptotic cell death
induced by edelfosine. This is in agreement with recent evidence
showing that the inhibition of phosphatidylcholine synthesis is
not the primary pathway in the induction of apoptosis by the
ALP hexadecylphosphocholine, as assessed by comparison of
hexadecylphosphocholine-induced apoptosis in CHO cells versus

Figure 6. Schematic model of ER involvement in edelfosine-induced apoptosis. This is a schematic diagram designed to portray one currently plausible
mechanism of how edelfosine induces apoptosis via ER stress. Edelfosine is incorporated into the tumor cell and accumulates in the ER, leading to the inhibition
of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and protein synthesis, and to G2-M arrest. Edelfosine also induces Bax/Bak-mediated ER-stored Ca2+ depletion, Bax up-regulation
and activation, CHOP/GADD153 up-regulation, ASK1-dependent JNK-persistent activation, and caspase-4 and caspase-8 activation with the generation of the
p20-BAP31 fragment. All of these events may lead to apoptosis through a mitochondrial-dependent process. The caspase inhibitors z-LEVD-fmk and z-IETD-fmk,
and the JNK inhibitor SP600125, reduce, only in part, the edelfosine-induced apoptosis, suggesting that these processes are acting in parallel. Protection of
mitochondria by Bcl-XL overexpression fully restrains cell death, indicating that the ER-triggered apoptotic signaling pathways converge on the mitochondria.

CHO-MT58 cells that contain a genetic defect in CCT and
phosphatidylcholine synthesis (39). Likewise, farnesol-induced
apoptosis has also been shown to be uncoupled from farnesolmediated inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis (40).
Edelfosine has also been reported to inhibit phosphatidylcholine
synthesis at a similar rate in both sensitive MCF-7 and resilient
A549 tumor cell lines, A549 cell proliferation being unaffected (41).
Hexadecylphosphocholine-induced apoptosis is prevented by the
addition of either lysophosphatidylethanolamine or lysophosphatidylcholine, despite the fact that only lysophosphatidylcholine is
able to attenuate the effect of the drug on phosphatidylcholine
synthesis (39). This suggests that a more general disturbance in
membrane structure, rather than a specific alteration in phosphatidylcholine metabolism, underlies ALP-induced apoptosis (39). In
this regard, edelfosine accumulates in lipid rafts (10, 42), modifying
membrane lipid composition and protein function (43). Thus, ALPs
could induce a general disturbance in the membrane structure or
bilayer packing, which may lead to membrane leakage or
destabilization.
The results reported here indicate that edelfosine inhibits
protein synthesis, a hallmark of ER stress. UPR is triggered as a
cellular survival response to ER stress. The balance between Grp78/
BiP, a UPR hallmark, and CHOP/GADD153 expression is considered
to lead to either cell survival or cell death in ER stress. Less
susceptibility to cell death upon activation of the UPR may
contribute to the tumor progression of solid tumors. Here, we
found that edelfosine induced CHOP/GADD153 expression, whereas Grp78/BiP protein levels remained unaffected, tipping the
balance in favor of an ER stress–induced cell death. Our study
shows that edelfosine induces a number of ER stress markers,
including CHOP/GADD153 up-regulation. Interestingly, Fas/CD95
death receptor is involved in the antitumor action of edelfosine in
tumor cells (5, 9, 10, 21), and Fas/CD95-induced apoptosis has been
reported to be mediated by CHOP/GADD153 (44). Thus, a putative

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

link between Fas/CD95 and ER could be envisaged in the action of
edelfosine in cancer cells. In addition, the accumulation of
edelfosine in lipid rafts (10, 42), together with the edelfosineinduced coclustering of Fas/CD95 in lipid rafts in leukemic cells
(5, 9, 10, 45), and recent evidence suggesting the existence of lipid
rafts in the ER (46, 47), might link the involvement of lipid rafts and
ER in the antitumor action of edelfosine.
Our data suggest that edelfosine-induced JNK activation is
mediated by ASK1. Caspase-4 was activated after the onset of
apoptosis in edelfosine-treated HeLa cells, suggesting that caspase-4
enhances the apoptotic response, but it is not required for the
triggering of cell death. These data square with recent evidence
showing that caspase-4 activation detected in ER stress–induced
apoptosis is not the result of an initiating event, but it occurs further
downstream in the apoptotic cascade (48). However, caspase-8 and
caspase-3 were activated before the onset of apoptosis following
edelfosine treatment. Caspase-8 cleavage of BAP31 at the ER leads to
the generation of a p20 fragment that directs proapoptotic signals
between ER and mitochondria, resulting in an early discharge of Ca2+
from the ER and its concomitant uptake into the mitochondria, which
prompts mitochondrial fission and cytochrome c release to the
cytosol (31). Our present data show that edelfosine induces the
cleavage of BAP31 with the formation of proapoptotic p20 fragment
and causes a gradual ER-stored Ca2+ release up to its total depletion in
HeLa cells. Edelfosine-induced apoptosis and ER-stored Ca2+ discharge were totally prevented in DKO cells. These data suggest that
edelfosine-induced apoptosis is dependent on Bax/Bak-mediated
Ca2+ release. Thus, our results indicate that Ca2+ signaling is essential
for the mechanism of action of edelfosine, likely regulating the link
between ER and mitochondria, and in this way, influencing the
sensitivity of mitochondria to other stress signals. Overexpression of
Bcl-XL, which specifically localizes and acts on the mitochondria (36),
blocks the apoptotic response induced by edelfosine without affecting
G2-M arrest or Ca2+ discharge from the ER. This indicates that the

ER Stress in Edelfosine Antitumor Action

apoptotic signals set off by edelfosine at the ER converge on the
mitochondria.
Our data from wild-type and DKO cells indicate that edelfosine
inhibition of phosphatidylcholine and protein biosynthesis is not
critical for the apoptotic response induced by edelfosine and is
independent of the mechanism related with Bax/Bak. Edelfosine
treatment leads to a conformational change of Bax. This
conformational change has been coupled to its activation and
precedes Bax translocation to the mitochondria and/or ER,
which may lead to a lesion of the organelle membrane integrity
(32, 49). In addition, edelfosine increased the protein levels of
Bax, whereas the protein levels of the antiapoptotic Bcl-XL and
proapoptotic Bak were not altered. Thus, the accumulation of
edelfosine in the ER leads to Bax activation and to higher levels
of Bax protein level, suggesting a major role for Bax in the
edelfosine-induced apoptotic response. Our previous (1) and
present data indicate that edelfosine does not modify the
expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL genes, whereas
Bax is up-regulated. Thus, the ratio of antiapoptotic to
proapoptotic molecules such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL/Bax, which
constitutes a rheostat that sets the threshold of susceptibility to
apoptosis, is shifted in favor of apoptosis induction following
edelfosine treatment. The apparent lack of significant activation
of Bak in drug-treated cells, despite the fact that cells deficient in
both bax/bak are required for edelfosine resistance, might be due
to either a faulty experimental approach to detect the appropriate activating Bak conformational change or to a rather different and complex regulation of Bak in apoptosis that involves
the preexistence and alteration of several protein complexes (50).
Figure 6 depicts a model for the involvement of ER in edelfosineinduced apoptosis in solid tumor cells based on our current data.
Unlike several anticancer drugs that induce ER stress in an indirect
way, edelfosine accumulates in the ER of solid tumor cells (11). This
drug accumulation leads first to the inhibition of phosphatidyl-

choline and protein synthesis by inhibiting CCT and promoting
eIF2a phosphorylation. These events promote G2-M arrest, but fail
to induce per se an apoptotic response. In addition, edelfosine
induces Bax/Bak-mediated ER-stored Ca2+ depletion, Bax upregulation and activation, CHOP/GADD153 up-regulation, caspase4 and caspase-8 activation, p20-BAP31 fragment generation, and
ASK1-dependent JNK-persistent activation. The fact that prevention of caspase-8, caspase-4, or JNK activation inhibits only in part
edelfosine-induced apoptosis indicates that these processes are
triggered in a rather parallel way. In contrast, Bcl-XL overexpression
totally blocks cell death, indicating that these parallel apoptotic
pathways converge on the mitochondria as the ultimate step to
rendering an apoptotic outcome. Our data on the ER Ca2+ release
exerted by edelfosine in wild-type cells, but not in bax / bak /
doubly deficient cells, suggests that Bax and Bak play an important
role in the proapoptotic mechanism of the drug, involving the
release of the ER Ca2+ pool with subsequent sensitization of
mitochondria. Taken together, our findings indicate that accumulation of edelfosine in the ER results in profound alterations of the
organelle functions, followed by transcriptional and biochemical
changes that eventually lead to apoptosis through a mitochondrion-mediated process.
