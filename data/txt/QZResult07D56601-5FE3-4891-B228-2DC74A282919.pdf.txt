ABSTRACT
High SERPINE1 expression is a common event in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC); however, whether it plays a role in determining clinical outcome
remains still unknown. We studied SERPINE1 as a prognostic marker in two HNSCC
patient cohorts. In a retrospective study (n = 80), high expression of SERPINE1 was
associated with poor progression-free (p = 0.022) and cancer-specific (p = 0.040)
survival. In a prospective study (n = 190), high SERPINE1 expression was associated
with poor local recurrence-free (p = 0.022), progression-free (p = 0.002) and cancerspecific (p = 0.006) survival. SERPINE1 expression was identified as an independent
risk factor for progression-free survival in patients treated with chemo-radiotherapy
or radiotherapy (p = 0.043). In both patient cohorts, high SERPINE1 expression
increased the risk of metastasis spread (p = 0.045; p = 0.029). The association
between SERPINE1 expression and survival was confirmed using the HNSCC cohort
included in The Cancer Genome Atlas project (n = 507). Once again, patients showing
high expression had a poorer survival (p < 0.001). SERPINE1 over-expression in
HNSCC cells reduced cell proliferation and enhanced migration. It also protected cells
from cisplatin-induced apoptosis, which was accompanied by PI3K/AKT pathway
activation. Downregulation of SERPINE1 expression had the opposite effect.
We propose SERPINE1 expression as a prognostic marker that could be used to
stratify HNSCC patients according to their risk of recurrence.

and chemotherapy have improved organ preservation and
patient quality-of-life [3]. However, 5-year survival has not
markedly changed in the last two decades due to the high rate
of loco-regional relapse and the development of metastasis
or secondary tumors [1, 4]. Classical clinicopathological

features are insufficient to predict clinical outcome or to
identify patients that will benefit from standard treatment
regimens. Therefore, the development of new predictive
biomarkers could help to classify this heterogeneous group
of tumors and improve treatment decision-making [5].
Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is a
frequent event during neoplastic transformation of
epithelial cells and it is also associated with tumor
malignancy, cell migration and invasion [6, 7]. The
plasminogen activator (PA) system plays a central role in
this process, in particular by regulating ECM proteolysis
and degradation [8]. SERPINE1 (PAI-1) is the main
regulator of the PA system, and it is also involved in signal
transduction, tumor growth, invasion and metastasis [9].
It is the main inhibitor of the plasminogen activators
tPA and uPA. Plasminogen activators (PA) stimulate the
production of plasmin that in turn activates the fibrinolytic
pathway and extracellular matrix degradation, leading
to enhanced tumor cell migration [10, 11]. In several
tumor types, SERPINE1 expression is up-regulated and
it has been described as a poor prognostic marker [9, 12].
Besides its prognostic value, SERPINE1 expression has
been validated as a marker for therapy decision making in
patients with node-negative breast cancer [13, 14].
Previous studies pointed out that SERPINE1
expression increases during malignant transformation of
squamous mucosa [15–19]. Gene expression profiles in
HNSCC show that SERPINE1 is commonly over-expressed
in primary tumors and lymph node metastasis [20–25].
However, the prognostic value of SERPINE1 in patients
with HNSCC is still unknown. Although some studies
have suggested an association between high SERPINE1
expression and poor prognosis [16, 20, 26–28], other authors
have not found evidences of such an association [15, 18, 29,
30]. Inconclusive data reported to date could be related to
small sample sizes or short follow-up data, and differences
in patient characteristics or in the endpoint used to measure
clinical outcome. Larger studies in patients with an accurate
and longer clinical follow-up are therefore still necessary to
establish the prognostic value of SERPINE1 in HNSCC.
On this basis, we studied the prognostic value of
SERPINE1 expression, analyzing a retrospective (n = 80)
and a prospective (n = 190) cohorts of HNSCC patients.
We analyzed SERPINE1 expression in a third patient
cohort obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database
(n = 507). We also analyzed the effect of SERPINE1
expression on proliferation, migration and apoptosis
induction in HNSCC cell lines.

with 68 months of median follow-up, were included in
the retrospective immunohistochemical analysis (Table 1).
Tumor cells showed membrane and cytoplasmatic
positivity for SERPINE1 (Supplementary files,
Figure S1). Tumor-adjacent normal tissue and stromal
tissue areas were negative or showed negligible staining
(Supplementary files, Figure S1).
Twenty-nine biopsies showed high SERPINE1
immunostaining intensity (3), 25 showed intermediate
intensity (2), and 26 displayed low or negative staining
(1) (Figure 1A). The percentage of SERPINE1 positive
cells was similar in all samples (80–95%).
We observed a significant association between
SERPINE1 immunostaining intensity and metastatic
recurrences after treatment (p = 0.045) (Table 1). The rate
of metastatic recurrences after treatment in patients with
high SERPINE1 staining was higher than in patients with
moderate or low staining.
SERPINE1 staining intensity was significantly
associated with progression-free survival (PFS)
(Figure  1C) and cancer-specific survival (CSS)
(Figure 1D). Patients bearing tumors with high SERPINE1
staining intensity (3) had a shorter progression-free (PFS)
(p = 0.022) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) (p = 0.040)
than patients with tumors showing intermediate (2) or low
(1) staining. There was a trend towards association between
SERPINE1 staining intensity and local recurrence-free
survival (LRFS), but this did not reach significance
(p = 0.108) (Figure 1B). Only one oropharyngeal tumor
was HPV positive in this patient cohort and was classified
in the high SERPINE1 expression group. After performing
an analysis that excluded this case we found that patients
with high SERPINE1 expression continue having a
significantly shorter progression-free survival than low
expressing patients (p = 0.015) (Supplementary files,
Figure S2).

High SERPINE1 mRNA expression increases the
risk of metastases development and is associated
with poor outcome
Following the positive association found in the
retrospective IHC study, we analyzed SERPINE1 mRNA
expression in 190 tumor biopsies obtained from an
independent cohort of HNSCC patients with 37 months of
median follow-up (Table 2). We also analyzed SERPINE1
expression in 24 normal mucosa samples obtained from
areas without visible lesions.
SERPINE1 expression was significantly higher in
tumor tissue than in normal mucosa samples (p < 0.001)
(Figure 2A). Classification and regression-tree analysis
method (CART) was used to establish the best cutoff to distinguish two groups of patients depending on
SERPINE1 mRNA tumor levels and their probability
of relapse (SERPINE1-mRNA level < or > 0.8). One
hundred and fourteen patients had tumors with a
SERPINE1 expression above the established threshold

(high expression), whereas 76 patients had tumors
with low SERPINE1 expression. The rate of metastatic
recurrences was significantly higher in the group of
patients with tumors expressing high levels of SERPINE1
(p = 0.029), thus confirming the results obtained in the
IHC analysis (Table 2). Alcohol consumption (p = 0.036)
and local recurrence (p = 0.028) were also associated with
SERPINE1 expression.
Patients with high SERPINE1 tumor expression
had shorter LRFS (p = 0.022), PFS (p = 0.002) and CSS
(p = 0.006) than patients with low SERPINE1 expression
(Figure 2). Multivariate Cox model analysis showed that
SERPINE1 expression (HR 1.73, 95%CI 1.02–2.92,
p  = 0.042), tumor size (HR 2.18, 95%CI 1.29–3.70,
p = 0.004) and node involvement (HR1.88, 95%CI
1.13–3.16, p = 0.016) were independent risk factors for
progression-free survival (Table 3). Moreover, tumor
size (HR 1.78, 95%CI 0.99–3.18, p = 0.050) and node
involvement (HR 2.23, 95%CI 1.22–4.07, p = 0.009) were
identified as independent risk factors for survival (Table 3).
There was a clear trend towards significance in the
association between high SERPINE1 expression and poor
patient survival (HR 1.78, 95%CI 0.98–3.23, p = 0.057),
however the differences observed among groups, did not
reach statistical significance in the multivariate analysis.
Multivariate Cox analysis, excluding patients treated with
surgery, showed that SERPINE1 expression (HR 1.92,
95%CI 1.03–3.59, p = 0.043) and tumor size (HR 2.39,
95%CI 1.29–4.39, p = 0.005) were independent risk
factors for progression-free survival in patients receiving
radiotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy as the main treatment
option (Table 3).
HPV status was analyzed in patients with
oropharyngeal cancer treated at Hospital de la Santa
Creu i Sant Pau (HSCSP). Thirty-five tumors were
HPV negative, 9 HPV positive and HPV status was
not available in 20 patients. SERPINE1 maintained its
value as a marker of progression-free survival, when
we analyzed the mRNA data from the prospective
RT-PCR patient cohort, after excluding patients with
oropharyngeal HPV positive tumors or oropharyngeal
tumors which HPV status was unknown (Supplementary
files, Figure S2). Patients with high SERPINE1 expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

had a significantly progression-free survival than patients
with low SERPINE1 expression (p = 0.015).
We analyzed SERPINE1 expression in a subgroup
(n = 69) of patients included in the prospective study
by immunohistochemistry. Again, SERPINE1 staining
intensity was significantly associated with progressionfree survival (PFS) (p = 0.016) and cancer-specific
survival (CSS) (p = 0.028), confirming the results obtained
by RT-PCR (Figure 2E–2H).

SERPINE1 expression was associated with poor
survival in a third cohort of HNSCC patients
included in The Cancer Genome Atlas database
We analyzed SERPINE1 expression in an
independent cohort of HNSCC patients having RNA
sequencing results from 520 primary tumors and 44
mucosa samples recorded in The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) database. SERPINE1 expression was
significantly higher in tumor than in mucosa samples
(p < 0.001) (Figure 3A). Kaplan -Meier curves showed
that patients with high SERPINE1 tumor expression had
shorter survival than patients with low SERPINE1 tumor
expression (p < 0.001) (Figure 3B).
Univariate Cox model analysis showed that
overall survival was significantly lower in patients
whose tumors expressed high level of SERPINE1 than
in patients with low SERPINE1 expression (HR:2.03,
95%CI 1.32–3.10, p = 0.01). Multivariate Cox analysis
showed that SERPINE1 expression (HR:1.73, 95%CI
1.05–2.79, p  =  0.027) and pathologic N classification
(HR:1.58, 95%CI 1.09–2.31, p = 0.017) were identified
as independent risk factors for death in this HNSCC
patient cohort (Table 4). Other clinical variables such as
sex, tumor size and age were not associated with patient
survival (Table 4). Differences in survival between high
and or low expressing tumors remained statistically
significant in an analysis of the TCGA patient cohort that
excluded HPV positive tumors (n = 20). Patients with
tumors showing a high expression of SERPINE1 continue
to have a significantly (p = 0.001) higher risk of death
than patients with low expression (Supplementary files,
Figure S2).

Interestingly, in the TCGA series, SERPINE1
expression was significantly associated with the
presence of perineural invasion (PNI) (p < 0.001, Fisher
test). PNI-positive rate was higher in tumors with high
SERPINE1 expression (54%) than in tumors expressing
low levels (23.9%). The rate of lymphovascular
invasion-positive tumors was higher in tumors with
a high SERPINE1 expression (37%) than in tumors
with a low expression (28%), however, differences
between groups for this variable did not reach statistical
significance (p > 0.05).

cells that stably expressed shRNA showed inhibition of
SERPINE1 expression (Figure 5A). The Inhibition of
SERPINE1 expression analyzed by RT-PCR was 65% for
the SCC9shRNA004 and 75% for the SCC9shRNA159
(Figure 5A).
After SERPINE1 inhibition, a partial loss of its
characteristic fusiform shape was observed in the SCC9
cell line (Figure 5B). Inhibition of SERPINE1 expression
by shRNA reduced migration in SCC9shRNA004
and SCC9shRNA159 transduced cells (p < 0.001 and
p < 0.001, respectively) (Figure 5C). Cell proliferation
was significantly higher in SCC9shRNA004 and
SCC9shRNA159 cells than in the parental SCC9 cells at
48 hours, 72 hours and 96 hours after seeding (Figure 5D).
We analyzed the activation status of the PI3K/
AKT cell signaling pathway in cells over-expressing
or under-expressing SERPINE1. The 74B-SerpE1up
cells, which over-expressed SERPINE1, showed
higher levels of AKT phosphorylation than the parental
UM-SCC-74B cell line, whereas SCC9shRNA004 and
SCC9shRNA159 transduced cells, that under-expressed
SERPINE1, had lower levels of AKT phosphorylation
than the SCC9 scramble cell line (Figure 5F). The
treatment of 74BSerpE1up cells during 48 hours with
a specific AKT inhibitor (MK-2206) reduced AKT
phosphorylation (Figure 5G) and reverted the increased
migration observed in cells over-expressing SERPINE1
(Figure 5H). Moreover, after 48 h of exposure to 50 nM
PAI-039, a specific inhibitor of SERPINE1, we observed
a downregulation of p-AKT in 74BSerpE1up cells overexpressing SERPINE1 (Figure 5I).

SERPINE1 expression inhibits cell proliferation
and enhances migration in head and neck
carcinoma cell lines
We analyzed SERPINE1 mRNA expression in
six head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines
(UM-SCC-22A, UM-SCC-22B, UM-SCC-74B, FaDu,
SCC9 and SCC25) (Figure 4A). The mean SERPINE1
mRNA level was 15.49 within a range of 1.00–69.24.
The SCC9 cell line displayed the highest SERPINE1
expression whereas the rest of cell lines expressed
similarly low SERPINE1 mRNA levels.
We next sought to determine whether the ectopic
over-expression or inhibition of SERPINE1 could
affect cell proliferation and migration. We generated
a UM-SCC-74B cell line stably over-expressing
SERPINE1 (74B-SerpE1up) by transducing it with
the pFUGW_SERPINE1 lentiviral vector (Figure 4B).
Transwell assays showed that SERPINE1 overexpression increased the migration capacity of the
UM-SCC-74B cell line (p = 0.004) (Figure 4C).
Moreover, cell proliferation was reduced in cells overexpressing SERPINE1 at 72 hours (p < 0.01) and 96
hours after seeding (p < 0.01) (Figure 4D).
The SCC9 cell line was selected for SERPINE1
down-regulation using lentiviral transduction with two
shRNA constructs (TRC2_331004, TRC2_370159).

Ectopic over-expression of SERPINE1 protects
cells from cisplatin–induced apoptosis
The 74B-SerpE1up cells, which over-expressed
SERPINE1, were less sensitive to cisplatin treatment
than UM-SCC-74B cells. After 48 hours of exposure to
cisplatin, the IC50 increased from 10 μM to 20 μM by
the ectopic expression of SERPINE1. We analyzed the

UM-SCC-74B and 74B-SerpE1up cells after 16 hours
of cisplatin treatment. Cells over-expressing SERPINE1
(74B-SerpE1up) showed fewer apoptotic bodies than the
parental UM-SCC-74B cells (Figure 4E). In line with these
results, the inhibition of SERPINE1 expression in SCC9
cells significantly increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
The number of apoptotic bodies after cisplatin exposure
in the SCC9shRNA004 and SCC9shRNA159 transduced
cells was higher than in SCC9 scramble cells (Figure 5E).

The number of apoptotic bodies observed after treatment
with the combination of cisplatin (48 h exposure) with the
AKT inhibitor MK2206 (72 h exposure), was significantly
higher in the UM-SCC-74B or 74BSerpE1up cells than in
the corresponding cells treated with cisplatin alone (48 h
exposure) (Figure 5J). The differences between groups
were more intense in cells over-expressing SERPINE1
(74B-SerpE1up) in which the combination of cisplatin
with the AKT inhibitor MK2206 completely reverted their
resistance to apoptosis.

The combination of cisplatin with the AKT inhibitor
MK2206 completely reverts the resistance of 74BSerpE1
cells (overexpressing Serpine1) to cisplatin, since it
induces apoptosis at a level similar to that achieved in
UM-SCC-74B cells after their treatment with the same

Evidence on the value of SERPINE1 expression
as a prognostic factor in head and neck cancer has been
inconclusive to date. In line with our results, Speleman
and colleagues showed that high expression of SERPINE1
was associated with shorter disease-free survival in a
univariate analysis performed in 46 HNSCC patients
[16]. Magnussen and colleagues identified SERPINE1
and uPAR expression as predictive markers of disease
specific death in early stage oral carcinomas (n = 26) [26].
However, due to the relatively small number of patients
analyzed and the lack of a multivariate analysis, these two
studies did not reveal whether SERPINE1 could be used
as an independent marker to predict the risk of disease
relapse. Three further studies also found that SERPINE1
expression was associated with HNSCC prognosis but
only when it was analyzed together with additional
markers, such as uPA, SPARC or SMA [20, 27, 28]. In
contrast, many other studies found no association between
SERPINE1 and clinical outcome in HNSCC patients [15,
18, 29, 30]. Our study may have helped towards resolving
this controversy because it has identified SERPINE1
expression as a strong independent prognostic marker in
patients with HNSCC.
Our results are consistent with those reported in
other cancer types. SERPINE1 has been associated with
poor clinical outcome in colon, breast, gastric, cervical,
esophageal, lung, ovarian and thyroid cancers [9, 14,
32–37]. Similarly to our findings in HNSCC, a high
expression of SERPINE1 was found to increase the risk
of developing metastasis in patients with node negative
breast cancer.
We have shown that the ectopic over-expression
of SERPINE1 promotes cell migration, whereas the
inhibition of SERPINE1 expression generates the opposite
effect, reducing the migration capacity of HNSCC cell
lines. The observed association between high SERPINE1
expression and enhanced cell migration may seem
counterintuitive regarding the notion that PA inhibition
could reduce ECM degradation and cell invasion.
However, previous studies have shown that SERPINE1

DISCUSSION
We identified SERPINE1 expression as a poor
prognostic marker in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma. A high expression of SERPINE1 increased the
risk of metastasis and was associated with a poor clinical
outcome.
We obtained these results analyzing two
independent patient cohorts with head and neck cancer
(n = 80, n = 190). We used a third patient cohort of
HNSCC (n = 507) included in TCGA database to support
the association between SERPINE1 expression and
patient survival. Despite using different methods to detect
SERPINE1 expression in pre-treatment tumor biopsies, we
observed a positive association between high SERPINE1
expression and poor clinical outcome in three independent
patient cohorts. Taken together, our results show that
SERPINE1 expression has a strong prognostic value in
patients with head and neck carcinoma. We also identified
SERPINE1 expression as an independent risk factor for
tumor progression in patients treated with radiotherapy or
chemo-radiotherapy.
We confirmed the prognostic value of SERPINE1
expression excluding HPV tumors from the survival
analysis in the three patient cohorts. Therefore, the
results of this study could be particularly relevant in HPV
negative HNSCC population. Due to the low incidence
of HPV positive tumors detected in our patient cohorts,
which is a finding consistent with our geographical area
[31], we could not assess whether SERPINE1 is or not a
prognostic marker in HPV positive patients. Future studies
in a large HNSCC patient cohort bearing HPV positive
tumors will be needed to assess this possibility.

promotes cell migration through its inhibitory activity
against plasmin, preserving the stromal architecture and
providing traction for cancer cells during migration [38].
Furthermore, SERPINE1 can also improve cell migration
by a mechanism independent of the fibrinolytic pathway
[39–41]. In vitro results, showing that SERPINE1 overexpression increases migration in head and neck tumor
cells, are in agreement with the higher risk of metastatic
recurrence observed in patients bearing tumors with a high
expression of SERPINE1. They are also consistent with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

perineural invasion being more frequent in tumors overexpressing SERPINE1 in the TGCA cohort, which also
support the role of this protein in head and neck tumor
dissemination.
We also showed that cells over-expressing
SERPINE1 were less sensitive to cisplatin treatment;
one of the main drugs included in most chemotherapy
protocols for the treatment of HNSCC patients.
Interestingly, we observed an activation of the AKT
pathway in cells over-expressing SERPINE1 that could

be responsible for the stimulation of cell migration and
the protection of HNSCC cells from cisplatin-induced
apoptosis. Similar findings have been reported in breast
carcinoma, human promyeolocityc leukemia, prostate
carcinoma and fibrosarcoma cells. In these tumor types
a high expression of SERPINE1 protects cells from
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and associates with the
activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
[42–44]. Consistently, activation of this pathway is
emerging as an important oncogenic mechanism in
HNSCC [45] and has been associated with an increase in
tumor cell motility and survival signaling [46–48].
Although the inhibition of cell proliferation in cells
displaying high SERPINE1 expression may at first glance
seem inconsistent with its oncogenic role, previous studies
have pointed out that the enhanced migration induced by
SERPINE1 expression may also be accompanied by a
decrease in cell proliferation [49, 50]. It is reasonable to
assume that changes in cell morphology necessary for cell
motility and migration (e.g. cytoskeleton reorganization)
are incompatible with those required for cell proliferation
and division [51–55]. In line with the results obtained
in head and neck cancer cells, SERPINE1 has also been
described as a key player in wound healing and tissue
remodeling programs by inhibiting cell proliferation
and promoting epithelial cell migration [49]. Regional
or distant metastases are the most common cause of
death in patients with HNSCC. However, little is known
about the mechanisms underlying their development.
Our results suggest that SERPINE1 expression could be
up-regulated during tumor cell transformation and this
could result in an increase in the capacity of tumor cells
to migrate, generate metastasis and develop resistance
to genotoxic therapy and this is likely to have a negative
impact on tumor response and patient clinical outcome.
In the future, SERPINE1 expression could be included,
together with other molecular and clinical variables, in
diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms to predict clinical
outcome in HNSCC patients. SERPINE1 could help to
improve patient stratification and to develop personalized
therapeutic approaches, thereby improving patient quality
of life and survival. Just as SERPINE1 expression is being
used to guide the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy
in patients with node-negative breast cancer, in HNSCC
patients it could be useful to help decide whether to
intensify or de-intensify treatment according to their
risk of recurrence. SERPINE1 levels could also be used
to define the group of patients who should have a close
clinical follow-up in order to anticipate the development
of metastatic recurrences. Despite the positive association
between SERPINE1 expression and poor clinical outcome
observed in three independent cohorts, larger multicenter
studies and clinical trials are warranted, using one of the
pre-established cut-offs and techniques here described, to
replicate our findings. This could validate SERPINE1 as

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a new biomarker useful for making treatment decisions in
head and neck carcinoma patients.
In summary, a high expression of SERPINE1 is a
poor prognostic marker in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma patients that increases the risk of metastatic
recurrences after therapy, possibly due to an increase in
tumor cell migration and in resistance to cisplatin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient characteristics, tissue samples and
clinical follow-up
This study was performed analyzing two
independent cohorts of patients with pathologically
confirmed HNSCC. A retrospective study (n = 80) was
performed using formallin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) pre-treatment tumor biopsies from patients at
advanced stage (III, IVa and IVb) treated between 1995
and 2003 at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (HSCSP),
Barcelona.
A second prospective study (n = 190) was run
using fresh tumor biopsies obtained from patients treated
at HSCSP (n = 167) and at Hospital Moises Broggi
(n = 23), Sant Joan Despí, Barcelona, from 2002 to 2012.
Twenty-four fresh mucosa samples were obtained from
HNSCC patients in areas without visible lesions. Fresh
samples were frozen in RNAlater (Life Technologies
Ltd, UK) and kept in liquid nitrogen until processing and
until de RT-PCR analyses. Tumor samples with < 80%
of tumor tissue were excluded from the prospective
study. Sixty-nine FFPE biopsies from patients included
in this cohort were used to confirm SERPINE1 by
immunohistochemistry. The study was approved by the
local Ethics Committee and the Institutional Review
Board at HSCSP, and informed consent was obtained
from each patient. The study was conducted in accordance
with REMARK guidelines and the declaration of Helsinki
(Supplementary files, table S1) [56]. The median followup time was 68 months in the retrospective study and 37
months in the prospective study.
Local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was defined
as time from treatment initiation to recurrence at the
primary site. Progression free-survival (PFS) was the
time elapsed between treatment initiation and tumor
progression. Tumor progression was considered as an
increase in tumor size of 25% or higher, or the appearance
of new lesions (local or regional recurrences, and distant
metastases). Cancer-specific survival (CSS) was defined as
time from diagnosis to death from cancer.
HPV status, detected using the short PCRfragment-10 (SPF-10) assay (Lab. Biomedical Products,
Rijswik, the Nederland’s), was available for oropharyngeal
tumors treated at HSCSP. A single patient with a HPV
positive tumor was included in the retrospective study.

In the prospective study, thirty-five tumors were HPV
negative, 9 HPV positive and HPV status was not available
in 20 patients.
We also analyzed SERPINE1 mRNA levels in 520
primary tumor samples and 44 normal mucosas obtained
from HNSCC patients included in The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) database (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/
tcga/). To analyze SERPINE1 expression in this cohort
we used level 3 RNASeqv2 normalized expression values.
Survival data were available for 507 patients.

3 minutes. Real Time RT-PCR reactions were performed
in duplicate using the Hs01126607_m1 gene expression
assay (Life Technologies Ltd, UK). HPRT1 amplification
(Hs99999909_m1) was used as an endogenous control
and RNA obtained from the UM-SCC-22A cell line was
used as the calibration sample. Gene expression levels
were expressed as fold change relative to the calibration
sample (UM-SCC-22A), applying the comparative CT
method (2#x2212;ΔΔCT). For UM-SCC-22A, RNA extraction
and cDNA synthesis were performed following the same
steps as described for tumor samples.

Immunohistochemistry

Cell culture

5-μm tissue block sections were deparaffinized
in xylol and rehydrated using decreasing ethanol
concentrations (100%, 96%, 80%, 70%, and 50%). For
antigenic retrieval, samples were immersed in target
retrieval solution, pH 9 (Dako, USA) and autoclaved
for 10 minutes at 121°C. Endogenous tissue peroxidase
was inactivated by immersing the samples in a 3% H2O2
solution for 10 minutes Samples were incubated with
SERPINE1 monoclonal antibody (clone 1D5; Abnova,
Taiwan) at 1:200 dilution. The EnVision™ FLEX and
FLEX+ Visualization System was used for primary
antibody detection following standard procedures. Two
head and neck surgical samples and SCC9 cells overexpressing SERPINE1 were used as positive controls
whereas negative controls were processed substituting
the primary antibody by non-immunized mouse serum
(Supplementary files, Figure S1). Immunostained sections
were quantified by two independent observers using a
Olympus BX51 microscope.
The percentage of positive cells (0–100%) and
the overall intensity of staining (1, no staining or weak;
2, moderate; and 3, strong) were established analyzing
five randomly choosen microscopic fields at 100x
magnification for each sample. SERPINE1 expression was
only evaluated in tumor cells.
There was inter-observer agreement in 95% of
the samples; the remaining slides were re-evaluated and
consensus decisions were made. Images were acquired
using an Olympus DP72 digital camera and processed
with CellD Imaging 3.3 software (Olympus).

SERPINE1 expression and proliferation, migration
and apoptosis assays were performed using six human
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines
(UM-SCC-22A, UM-SCC-22B, UM-SCC-74B, SCC9,
SCC25 and FaDu). 293T cells were only used to generate
lentivirus-containing supernatants.
UM-SCC-22A, UM-SCC-22B, UM-SCC-74B
[58] and 293T (ATCC® CRL-3216™; ATCC;http://www.
lgcstandards-atcc.org) cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10%
FBS, 100 U/mL streptomycin / penicillin and 2 mM
glutamine (Life Technologies Ltd, UK). SCC-9 (ATCC®
CRL-1629™) and SCC-25 (ATCC® CRL-1628™)
HNSCC cell lines were grown in DMEM/F12 (1:1)
containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL streptomycin/penicillin,
2 mM glutamine and 0.4 μg/mL of hydrocortisone. FaDu
(ATCC® HTB-43™) HNSCC cell line from ATCC was
grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL streptomycin/penicillin
and 2 mM glutamine. All cell lines were cultured in a
humidified atmosphere at 37°C and 5% of CO2. Cell lines
were authenticated comparing the STR profiles obtained
using the Cell ID kit (Promega Corporation, Madison,
WI) with the original STR profiles previously described
(Supplementary files, table S2) [58, 59].

Generation of SERPINE1 over-expressing
cell lines
cDNA-encoding human SERPINE1 was obtained
from a pcDNA3.1-SERPINE1 plasmid (generously
gift from Paul J. Higgins) and subcloned into the XhoIBamHI site of the lentiviral vector FUtdTW obtained
from Addgene (http://www.addgene.org/) [60, 61].
Lentiviral packaging was achieved after cotransfection
of the vector plasmid with pMD.G_VSV G-poly-A
vector and p8 91-Gag-Pol vector into 293T cells using
lipofectamine 2000 kit (Life Technologies Ltd, UK).
The lentivirus-containing supernatant was harvested 48
hours after 293T transfection, filtered through a 45 μm
filter (Millipore) and stored at -80°C. UM-SCC-74B cells
were transduced with the SERPINE1-expressing lentiviral

RNA purification and RT-PCR
RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life
Technologies Ltd, Paisley, UK) as previously described
[57]. cDNA synthesis was performed using 1.5 μg of
total RNA, 5 μL of RT buffer, 2 μL of dNTPs mixture,
5 μL of Random Hexamer Primers, 125 U of MultiScribe
Reverse Transcriptase and 40 U of RNase inhibitor
(Life Technologies Ltd, Paisley, UK), in a 50 μL final
reaction volume with the High Capacity cDNA Archive
Kit (Life Technologies Ltd, UK). Reaction conditions

vector (pFUGW_SERPINE1) and stable SERPINE1 overexpressing cells were selected exposing cells to 500 μg/
mL zeocin for four weeks.

To determine cisplatin-induced apoptosis, we
treated cells with 15–40 μM cisplatin for 16 hours. After
treatment, cells were fixed for 1 minute in methanol at
-20°C and stained with ProLong®Gold Antifade DAPI
(Life Technologies Ltd, Paisley, UK). Apoptotic and
non-apoptotic nuclei were counted under a fluorescence
microscope. We determined the mean percentage of
apoptotic bodies assessing six 200X images per sample.
MK-2206 (Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA) and PAI-039
(Axon Medchem BV, Netherlands) inhibitors were used to
study the AKT pathway activation.

Generation of SERPINE1 knockdown cell lines
Lentiviral vectors (pLKO.1-puro) containing
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against human SERPINE1
(TRC2_331004, TRC2_370159) and non-mammalian
shRNA control plasmid DNA (scramble) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA).
Lentiviral packaging and transduction of SCC9 cells were
performed as described for SERPINE1 over-expression.
Stable SERPINE1 knockdown cells were selected in
10  μg/mL puromycin (Life Technologies Ltd, Paisley,
UK). After four weeks of antibiotic selection, SERPINE1
expression was determined by Real Time PCR and
Western blot.

Western blot
Cell protein extracts and western blot analysis were
performed as previously described [63]. Briefly, 75 μg of
cellular protein extract was electrophoretically-separated
and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes over-night.
Membranes were blocked in TBS-T buffer [0.132 m NaCl,
0.02 m Tris (pH7.5), 0.1% Tween 20] containing 5 g/100 ml
of milk for 1.5 hours and incubated over-night with primary
antibodies. Dilutions for the primary antibodies were:
SERPINE1(1:1000, MAB10390, Abnova, USA), PhosphoAkt (Thr308)(1:1000, #9275, Cell Signalling), Akt (1:500,
Mouse anti-Akt clone 55, BD Biosciences), ERK(1:2500,
clone 16/ERK, BD Biosciences, USA), PI3K (1:2500, clone
4/PI3-Kinase, BD Biosciences) and GAPDH (1:10000,
MAB374, Merck Millipore, Germany).

Proliferation, migration, cytotoxicity and
apoptosis assays
Proliferation assays were performed seeding cells
in the range of 3.5 × 104 cells/well (UM-SCC-74B and
vector-transduced cells) to 7 × 104 cells/well (SCC9 and
shRNA-transduced cells) in six-well plates. Cells were
harvested after 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h of growth and
counted using a Countess® automated cell counter (Life
Technologies Ltd, UK).
For the migration assays, cells were pre-incubated
for 24 hours in FBS-free medium and seeded onto the
upper chamber of a transwell cell culture insert diameter
6.5 mm, pore size 8 μm) (Corning, USA) in the presence
of FBS-free medium. Each insert was introduced into a
well (12-well plate) containing 500 μL of medium with
FBS. After 24 hours incubation, cells at the top of the
upper transwell chamber were removed by a mechanical
action with gauze swabs and the external cells at the
bottom of the transwell chamber were fixed for 10 minutes
in methanol, stained with crystal violet for 10 minutes
and dried at 37°C. Images were captured using the
DP73 Olympus digital camera (Olympus Corporation,
Japan). The extent of migration was determined by the
area fraction occupied by cells in five ×100 fields using
CellSens dimension v1.9 software (Olympus Corporation,
Japan). Experiments were performed in triplicate and
repeated three times.
For cytotoxicity assays, cells seeded in 96 well/
plates (2500 cells/well), were exposed to cisplatin at a
concentration ranging from 2.5 to 80 μM for 48 hours.
We determined drug sensitivity measuring cell metabolic
capacity using the XTT Cell proliferation kit II, as
previously described (Roche Diagnostics, Germany)
[62]. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
was calculated by linear interpolation as previously
described [62].

Statistical analysis
In the RT-PCR analysis and the TCGA database,
the cut off to distinguish patients with high SERPINE1
expression and patients with low SERPINE1 expression
was determined using Classification and Regression Tree
Analysis (CART) [64]. CART analysis selected the cutoff with the best sensitivity and specificity to distinguish
patients with a high risk of disease relapse from patients
with low risk according to PA-1 expression.
Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used
to assess the association between sex, age, tumor site,
tumor size, node status, tumor differentiation, tobacco
and alcohol consumption, rate of recurrences, with
SERPINE1 expression. We distinguished between local
(same anatomic site for recurrence and primary tumor)
and metastatic (node recurrences or distant metastasis)
recurrences. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Log-Rank test
were used to analyze differences in LRFS, PFS and CSS
between the subgroups of patients established according
to SERPINE1 expression. A multivariate Cox model was
used to test the association between sex, tumor size, node
involvement, age or SERPINE1 mRNA expression with
PFS and CSS. To analyze differences between two or more
conditions in “in vitro” assays, we used the non-parametric
Mann–Whitney U or Kruskal–Wallis tests.
