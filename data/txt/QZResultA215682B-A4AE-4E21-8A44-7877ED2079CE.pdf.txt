ABSTRACT:

Targeted therapies of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) using tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKI) have profoundly changed the natural history of the disease with a
major impact on survival. Molecular monitoring with BCR-ABL quantification shows
that a status of undetectable molecular residual disease (UMRD) is obtained in a
significant minority of patients. However, it remains unclear whether these patients
are definitively cured of their leukemia. Imatinib mesylate withdrawal trials have
demonstrated the rapid appearance of the malignant clone in the majority of the
patients whereas some patients remain in a state of UMRD. It has clearly been
demonstrated that the most primitive stem cells are refractory to all TKIs used in
clinical practice. In addition, long-term dormancy is one of the most fundamental
characteristics of hematopoietic stem cells. In this context, we have recently
undertaken a systematic analysis of the bone marrow stem cell compartment in
several patients in durable UMRD. We have demonstrated the long-term persistence
of a considerable amount of BCR-ABL-expressing stem cells, even in the absence
of relapse. The phenomenon of long-term leukemic stem cell dormancy is of major
importance in CML and one of the key questions in cancer biology in general. We
discuss, here, the potential mechanisms, including intrinsic and microenvironmental
factors, that control the response of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) to targeted
therapies and potential novel strategies currently in progress with a curative intent.
Moreover, we propose a molecular evaluation of the residual LSC compartment
in selected patients in order to develop rational TKI-cessation strategies in CML.

INTRODUCTION

During the last three decades, substantial progress
has been accomplished in the therapy of the disease.
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) was the first
potentially curative therapy for CML patients in chronic
phase [5]. However, SCT could not be applied to all
CML patients because of the lack of HLA-compatible
donors, but also because of immediate and late toxicities
due to this process. Interferon-alpha (IFN-α), alone or
associated with cytarabine, displayed real efficiency in
a small number of patients, allowing durable complete
cytogenetic remissions or CCyR (absence of Ph1-positive
metaphase in conventional cytogenetic analysis) in
patients responding to treatment [6].
Over the last ten years, small compounds such as
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed for
targeted therapy of CML [7]. The introduction of imatinib

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a major model
of oncogenesis involving primitive hematopoietic stem
cells (HSCs). A unique genetic alteration, the t(9;22)
(q34;q11) translocation that gives rise to the Philadelphia
chromosome (Ph1) generates the BCR-ABL fusion
oncoprotein with deregulated tyrosine kinase (TK)
activity [1]. Genetic instability phenomenon seems to be
both the cause of Ph1 formation and the consequences of
BCR-ABL activation [2]. Functional consequences of the
t(9;22) translocation include an increased cell proliferation,
a deregulation of cellular adhesion/migration and a
resistance to apoptosis [3,4]. In the absence of treatment,
CML classically progresses from chronic phase to blast
crisis with an intermediate accelerated phase.

breakpoints between BCR and ABL genes were identical
in each cell lineage of a same patient strengthened this
concept. Although the involvement of T-cells has been
rarely reported in CML, the occurrence of T-lymphoid
blast crisis has been clearly documented [23], suggesting
the involvement of a very primitive progenitor. More
recently, the existence of stem cells with hemangioblastlike properties has been reported in several studies [24,25]
but not confirmed by others [26]. Finally, BCR-ABL gene
transfer experiments into both murine and human HSCs
suggested that the expression of this oncogene was
sufficient to initiate CML [27].
As for normal hematopoietic stem cells, CML
stem cells (in the chronic phase of the disorder) have the
ability to self-renew and to differentiate in committed
progenitors, which produce the mature hematopoietic
cells. Why and how the expression of BCR-ABL does not
impede the mature cell production is not clear at the present
time. However, the unperturbed C/EBP (CAAT/enhancer
binding protein)-alpha expression in chronic phase might
be involved in this event [28]. CML stem cells have been
also characterized by the difficulty to examine their in
vitro behavior as their cell surface markers are very similar
to normal HSCs, which are enriched in cell populations
sorted by CD34+CD38-CD71-, and/or Thy1+ markers [29].
Classically, studies involving hematopoietic progenitor
and more primitive stem cell compartments have used
either clonogenic (colony forming units in culture or
CFU-C) or long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC)
assays. These biological tests have shown, as expected,
the presence of Ph1 chromosome in both compartments,
but interestingly, they revealed the persistence of normal,
Ph-1 negative stem cells at diagnosis [30] and even at later
stages of the disease [31].
Although the expansion of the myeloid cell
compartment occurs in the marrow, CFU-C activity is
highly increased in peripheral blood at diagnosis [32]. A
defect of maintenance of Ph1 clone in vitro as compared
to normal cells was shown by LTC-IC experiments [33].
Thus, there is a clear expansion of the more differentiated
progenitor and myeloid cells in peripheral blood, which
certainly explains the symptoms of the disease. However,
the events that lead to leukemic clonal dominance in the
presence of a less amplified stem cell compartment are not
established at the present time. Cell cycling studies have
revealed an increased cycling of clonogenic progenitors in
CML as compared to normal ones [34]. Analyses of more
primitive stem cells compartments using immunodeficient
mouse transplantion assays have not been very successful
in CML, as they have been in acute myeloid leukemia
[35,36]. These results were probably due to the difficulties
of engraftment of such cells in NOD/SCID mouse, either
due to cell rejection or homing deficiency of CML
progenitors. Therefore, LTC-IC assays using murine
stromal feeders [37] undoubtedly represent the most
stringent stem cell assays in human CML.

mesylate (IM) has profoundly modified the natural history
of CML and dramatically improved patient survival [8,9].
Nevertheless, a small percentage of patients develop
primary or secondary resistance to IM therapy. Biological
mechanisms of resistance are either BCR-ABL-dependent
or –independent. Among them, missense mutations,
identified within the ABL tyrosine kinase (ABL-TK)
domain, were the most studied. More than 100 mutation
affecting approximately 70 amino acids were identified
[10]. The presence of these mutations modifies the protein
structure and induces a conformational change of the
kinase domain or disruption of the interactions between
IM and BCR-ABL (affecting hydrogen or van der Waals
bonds). Consequently, drug binding is impaired or totally
abolished by ABL-TK mutations. Second generation TKIs
such as dasatinib, nilotinib or bosutinib, were designed
to overcome imatinib resistance [11-13]. These drugs
are effective on most of the mutants, except for some
p-loop mutations (moderate or intermediate resistance)
or the gatekeeper T315I substitution. This mutation, first
reported by Gorre et al. [14], was shown to confer an
absolute resistance to all known ATP-competitive BCRABL inhibitors used in clinical practice [15,16]. More
recently, a pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor TKI (ponatinib) was
shown to be active against the T315I mutation [17].
In addition to mechanistic aspects of TKI-resistance
due to the structure of the target oncoprotein, a novel level
of complexity, inherent to the hierarchical nature of CML
stem cells has been identified. This refers to the resistance
of the most primitive HSCs to all TKIs currently used,
because of three principal causes: their quiescence [18],
the high levels of BCR-ABL expression [19] or their
“oncogene-independence” [20]. Recent data showing a
molecular relapse in the majority of patients upon IMdiscontinuation [21] might suggest the in vivo persistence
of leukemic stem cells (LSCs).
In the present research perspective, we focus on
BCR-ABL-expressing hematopoietic stem cells in the
context of anti-CML treatment. We analyze the question
of the importance of LSCs in the maintenance of the
leukemia and the development of resistance to antileukemia therapies. Finally, we discuss the notion of LSC
persistency and the relationship between the concept of
cure and the requirement of targeting leukemic stem cells.

microenvironment: A guilty cross-talk?

Interactions between receptors expressed by HSCs
and ligands produced by marrow niches have been
extensively studied [45]. The osteoblastic niche produces
various soluble ligands that can act as growth factors
for leukemic cells or recognize specific receptors on the
surface of HSCs [46]. For example, Tie2 (tyrosine kinase
with immunoglobulin and EGF homology domains),
CXCR4 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4) and particular
integrin receptors respectively binds Angiopoetin, SDF1α (stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha) and Osteopontin
produced in the bone marrow niche (Figure 1). Normal HSCs
expresses the CXCR4 receptor, which recognizes SDF-1α
(abundantly secreted in the marrow microenvironment),
allowing the homing of HSCs to bone marrow niches.
Importantly, the quiescence/cycling balance of normal
hematopoietic stem cells prevents the exhaustion of the
stem cell pool and critical components controlling these
events are progressively being discovered. This is the case
for JAM-B (junction adhesion molecule B) expressed
by stromal cells, controlling quiescence [47] and Agrin
expressed by marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
and endosteal cells, recognizing a specific receptor on the
most primitive HSC [48].
In CML, the BCR-ABL oncoprotein decreases
the adhesion of LSCs to the bone marrow environment

Long-term preservation of a normal hematopoiesis
is based on the crucial property of HSCs to escape from
the cell cycle and to remain quiescent in the bone marrow
microenvironment (or niche). The quiescence phenomenon
refers to a reversible cell cycle arrest (G0 phase), whereas
dormancy concept represents the metabolic state of
quiescent cells. Although not exactly synonymous,
quiescence and dormancy are now used indifferently in
human biology. One of the major characteristics of CML
stem cells is the presence of highly quiescent primitive
stem cells, which can be present at diagnosis in peripheral
blood [38]. The majority of LSCs appears to be in cell
cycle, whereas normal HSCs are generally quiescent [39].
It has been reported that bone marrow microenvironment
could regulate some HSC properties such as quiescence,
self-renewal, expansion, and survival [40]. This regulation
takes place in the osteoblastic and vascular niches [41],
which might irrespectively control highly quiescent [42]
and more active HSCs [43]. Recently described nestinexpressing mesenchymal stem cells could represent
a unifying concept between osteoblastic and vascular
niches [44].

through constitutive phosphorylation of several focal
adhesion-associated molecules [49]. However, very little
is known concerning the interactions between CML stem
cells and the niche components. We have previously
shown that BCR-ABL-expressing CML cells secreted high
levels of osteopontin, a component of the hematopoietic
niche capable to induce HSC quiescence [50] (Figure1).
It has also been shown that BCR-ABL down-regulates the
CXCR4 receptor in a TK-dependent manner, affecting the
migration of leukemic cells towards SDF-1α in vitro, this
effects being reversed by the use of IM [51]. In a BCRABL-expressing cell line model, it has been suggested
that the expression of CXCR4 under the influence of IM,
could generate a migration of the cells escaping apoptosis,
towards bone marrow niches, this “homing” inducing
quiescence and CML stem cell survival [52].
The influence of the bone marrow niche on the
behavior of CML stem cells has recently been the subject
of an intense debate. This microenvironment can certainly
favor the survival of CML stem cells by providing survival
and quiescence factors (such as TGF-β) but the notion of
intrinsic abnormalities of the niche in CML has not been
extensively studied. Despite the fact they are not a part of
the malignant Ph1 clone, MSCs from CML patients are
abnormal and secrete large amounts of PlFG (placental

growth factor), which promotes marrow angiogenesis
and CML proliferation [53]. Therefore, the niche might
provide survival factors to CML stem cells probably in the
context of LSC/niche cross-talk. Finally, some diffusible
factors such as TGF-β provided by the microenvironment,
could activate quiescence pathways on LSC, via nuclear
translocation of forkhead O transcription factors (FOXO)
[54].

TARGETING LEUKEMIC STEM CELLS:
REQUIRED FOR CURE?
Although TKI therapy (IM and 2nd generation
inhibitors) demonstrated great efficacy in most chronic
phase CML patients, data from first line IM trials
show that 15% of patients resist to the therapy [9].
Classically, the mechanisms of resistance/refractoriness
are drug dependant, BCR-ABL dependent or BCR-ABL
independent (Table 1) [55]. A second level of resistance is
now known to occur in the very primitive stem cell level;
a finding documented in vitro and in vivo as observed in
IM-cessation trials.

CML stem cells are refractory to TKI therapies

ABL-TK mutation in CML stem cells

In vitro, it has been shown that the most primitive
quiescent LSCs are intrinsically refractory to imatinib
[18,56], dasatinib [57], nilotinib [58] and bosutinib [59].
However, it should be noted that dasatinib retains a better
efficacy in the stem cell compartment than imatinib.
Multiple mechanisms can play a role in the innate
resistance of primitive HSCs toward TKIs including
down-regulation of OCT-1 transporter (allowing IM
transport inside cells), up-regulation of ABCB1 (MDR1)
and ABCG2 efflux drug transporters or high levels of
BCR-ABL protein present in these cells [60,61]. In a
transgenic mice model, restricting the expression of BCRABL in stem cell antigen 1 (Sca1)-positive cells, the
authors generated a murine CML intrinsically resistant
to IM [62]. Some unknown epigenetic changes induced
in the context of CML cells could explain these findings
and remain to be explored. In addition, a recent work has
shown that the survival of Ph1-positive LSCs might be
independent of the BCR-ABL kinase activity [20].

Early clinical observations in CML patients have
suggested that ABL-TK mutations can occur in Ph1 stem
cells. We have demonstrated, in vitro, the occurrence of
ABL-TK mutations (Q252E and M351T) in CD34+CD38cell populations and their LTC-IC-derived progeny [63].
These results were later confirmed in CD34+ cells from
CML patients using subcloning-PCR [64]. Consequently,
it is now clear that BCR-ABL mutations arise in the
primitive hematopoietic compartment. Concerning
the T315I gatekeeper mutation, we have performed an
extensive analysis of CFU-C and LTC-IC assays on bone
marrow and blood cells from a CML patient using an allelespecific RT-qPCR (Reverse transcription-quantitative
real-time PCR) [65]. We clearly demonstrated that this
substitution has occurred in a very primitive Ph1 stem
cell without altering its myeloid and erythroid terminal
differentiation potential [31].
Overall, these data suggest that primitive quiescent
CML stem cells (with or without ABL-K mutations) are
protected from targeted therapies under the influence

of cell-autonomous pathways or external cues such as
niche-driven mechanisms, leading to the accumulation
of a genuine leukemic reservoir. In addition, recent data
concerning the “oncogene-independence” of these cells
suggest that TKIs alone, although extremely efficient
in the bulk of the disease burden, will not theoretically
lead to a complete eradication of the disease. The current
development of strategies targeting CML leukemic stem
cells using specific pathways is based on this concept.

progenitors could re-acquire some stemness properties
(e.g. self-renewing) through an activation of β-catenin
[70]. Recently, Hes1 (a Notch target gene) was shown
to maintain CML stem cell self-renewal and promote
blast crisis transformation [71]. The importance of the
Sonic Hedgehog pathway has also been demonstrated in
LSC renewal and CML progression. [72,73]. Moreover,
the hematopoietic niche could regulate Notch and Wnt
signaling pathways [42,74]. The well-known PML tumor
suppressor involved in promyelocytic leukemia through
the PML-RARα rearrangement has also been shown to
be required for the maintenance of normal HSCs and
CML stem cells [75]. Targeted therapy against normal and
leukemic stem cells could now be considered since many
critical signaling pathways involved in the maintenance of
stemness can be inhibited (Table 2).

TARGETING STEM CELL MOLECULAR
PATHWAYS
Many signaling pathways are involved in the basic
properties of HSCs, some of them could be specific of
LSCs. Consequently they represent a target for potential
therapy against CML stem cells [66,67].

Signaling pathways specific to LSCs

and normal HSCs

Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5) has been
shown to be indispensable for the survival, proliferation
and differentiation of CML stem cells. In addition, the
inhibition of Alox5 specifically impairs LSC functions
and does not affect normal HSCs [76]. The AHI-1
(abelson helper integration site 1) oncogene might also
be a potential LSC target since it appears over-expressed
in CML stem cells and enhance BCR-ABL effect on cell
growth [77]. In vitro, the suppression of AHI-1 over-

in the maintenance of stem cell functions. Wnt/β-catenin

the disease, it has been suggested that hematopoietic

expression was related to a reduction of LSC growth
autonomy. Moreover, AHI-1 was found to interact not
only with BCR-ABL but also with the JAK2/STAT5
pathway. In another field, it has been shown that the
inhibition of the Hsp90 protein (a chaperone for BCRABL) could target CML stem cell [78]. Finally, recent
publications highlight the benefit of targeting STAT5
(signal transducers and activators of transcription 5) since
this pathway has been clearly involved in leukemia cell
survival and TKI resistance [79,80]. However, to be used
as therapy, the effects of STAT5 inhibitors on the LSC
compartment have to be verified [81].

blood and/or marrow samples using RNA samples of
adequate quality characterizes an undetectable molecular
residual disease or UMRD (also named complete
molecular response). It is noticeable that the non-detection
of BCR-ABL mRNA transcript does not mean the complete
eradication of leukemic cells since up to one million CML
hematopoietic cells could persist in the patient’s body in
the UMRD context.

Mathematical models of treatment monitoring
These models are based on the kinetics of BCRABL mRNA transcripts determined during molecular
monitoring of CML patients. For most patients responding
to imatinib, a biphasic BCR-ABL/ABL exponential decrease
is typically observed. Mathematical modeling of such
observations related to the hematopoietic differentiation
process (from hematopoietic stem cells to mature cells)
has been elaborated [89,90]. The two slopes of the BCRABL mRNA decline curves (3-4 log reduction) could be
consistent with the eradication of differentiated mature
CML cells (fast slope) and leukemic progenitors (slow
slope). Therefore, residual leukemic cells in the UMRD
context are likely to correspond to CML stem cells. Using
the same model, it was recently suggested that sustained
TKI therapy might reduce (in part and in some cases) the
leukemic stem cell burden [91]. In addition, these models
propose some hypotheses concerning the relationship
between leukemic progenitors and blast crisis [92], the
eradication of CML stem cells [91,93], and the importance
of stem cell quiescence on the success of TKI therapy [94].
However, data concerning the stem cell compartment have
to be verified on biological experiments.

DYNAMICS OF THE RESPONSE TO
TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITORS
The hematological follow-up of CML patients on
TKI treatment is classically based on blood cell counts
(estimation of the hematologic response), cytogenetic
analysis by the determination of the percentage of Ph1positive metaphases (evaluation of the cytogenetic
response) and quantification of BCR-ABL mRNA
transcripts (assessment of the molecular response).
International recommendations have determined the
appropriate periods of testing in order to ascertain the
status of the response (optimal and suboptimal responses,
failure, warnings) [82]. Moreover, a screening of ABL-TK
mutations is mandatory in case of TKI failure (primary
resistance) or loss of therapy response (secondary
resistance) [83].

Monitoring of treatment response
RT-qPCR is the most sensitive test for the
quantification of BCR-ABL mRNA transcripts. Laboratory
protocols are now properly standardized [84-86] and
international reference controls have been elaborated
[87]. A BCR-ABL/“control gene” ratio is determined with
usually ABL as the control gene. The main objective of
these collaborative studies was to establish a concordant
major molecular response (MMR) value corresponding
to a BCR-ABL/ABL ratio of 0.1%. Moreover, for TKI
good responders, RT-qPCR remains the ultimate test to
follow the residual disease. It must be underlined that the
limit of detection of BCR-ABL quantification protocols is
around 10-5 (BCR-ABL/ABL ratio ~ 0.001%). The regular
quantification of the BCR-ABL mRNA transcript level,
evaluated by a BCR-ABL/ABL ratio every 3 months allows
the determination of kinetics of CML response throughout
the disease monitoring.
A schematic representation of decreasing CML
residual disease has been proposed [88]. It integrates the
BCR-ABL/ABL ratios, the estimated total-body leukemic
cell burden, the CCyR, and the MMR (Figure 2). The
absence of detectable BCR-ABL mRNA transcript from

LEUKEMIC STEM CELL PERSISTENCY
AND CURE OF CML
Data from patients treated with allogeneic SCT,
which is considered as the only “curative” therapy of
CML, show that late relapses can occur up to 15 years
after transplants. An unbalanced relationship between
LSCs and graft versus leukemia effect, which might be
operational in a fraction of LSC, could be the cause of
late relapses [95]. Concerning IFN-α or TKIs (mainly
imatinib), several treatment discontinuation trials have
been performed. Although data from IM discontinuation
trials suggest that some patients are disease-free and
off-therapy for approximately 3-4 years, a significant
percentage of patients relapsed (molecular or cytogenetic
relapses) after the cessation of the therapy. Overall, these
data point to a likely role of CML stem cells in the relapse
occurrence. Therefore, investigation of the stem cell
compartment in these patients seems to be warranted, in
order to determine 1) the persistence of these cells in the
UMRD context and 2) their relevance with regard to the
719

sample. Detection at the genomic level of the BCRABL rearrangement in some patients in UMRD after IM
therapy or SCT demonstrated the presence of residual
leukemic cells not detected by RT-PCR experiments
[108,109]. These data show that leukemic cells are not
entirely eradicated by TKIs. It must be noted that, in these
experiments, BCR-ABL positive DNA was detected in
peripheral blood. In addition, the stem cell compartment
was not analyzed. Moreover, RT-qPCR experiments
on purified sorted cells from CML patients treated with
imatinib showed the elimination of CML progenitors
within one year but the retention of the LSC population
[110].
Ten years ago, (based on the observation of patients
in sustained CCyR following IFN-α or allogeneic SCT),
we postulated that the BCR-ABL rearrangement could
persist unexpressed in dormant cells [111]. The persistence
of such dormant leukemic progenitors in CCyR induced
after IFN-α therapy had previously been demonstrated
using RT-PCR experiments on CFU-Cs, [112]. More
recent studies in CML patients who achieved CCyR
following TKI therapy (mainly imatinib, but also dasatinib
or bosutinib) have also demonstrated the persistence
of Ph1 stem cells [113-115]. These experiments were
performed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on
CD34+ fraction [113,114], CD34+ CD38- cells [115] or
CFU-Cs and LTC-IC [113] populations. In these studies,
the presence of persistent LSCs was somewhat expected
as there was no evidence of molecular eradication of the
leukemia.
The UMRD status can now be obtained in CML
patients treated with TKI and, have also been observed
in historical cohorts, in a minority of patients treated with
IFN-α. The question of whether BCR-ABL-expressing
LSCs persist in these populations has been unexplored so
far. We have analyzed the presence of BCR-ABL-expressing
hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow samples from
six CML patients with undetectable BCR-ABL transcript
in their peripheral blood for more than 3 years [96]. The
experimental design was based on CFU-C and LTCIC assays according to a common protocol. Long-term
cultures were carried out either on classical murine MS-5
feeder cells or on HOXB4-expressing MS-5 stromal cells
[37,116]. Approximately 20 individual colonies and up to
20 pools of 10 colonies were plucked from clonogenic
assays at day 0 and from LTC-IC-derived progenitors at
week 5. Individual and pooled colonies were tested for the
presence of BCR-ABL mRNA by RT-qPCR and controlled
by nested RT-PCR. Using this strategy, we detected a
variable percentage of BCR-ABL-expressing stem cells in
all patients analyzed. Interestingly, these primitive HSCs
did not produce any detectable BCR-ABL transcript in the
peripheral blood, suggestive of their quiescent status in
vivo, even in patients in whom the anti-leukemic therapy
had been stopped for > 11 years. It is noticeable that a
greater percentage of BCR-ABL-expressing stem cells

occurrence of the relapse. This approach appears crucial to
design rational algorithms of TKI-therapy discontinuation
trials [96].

Therapy discontinuation trials
For IFN-α therapy, clinical experiences have shown
that a minority of CML patients achieved a long-term
period of CCyR. In this population, it has been reported
that some patients who stopped their treatment maintained
a durable CCyR [97]. In this work, one patient who was in
major cytogenetic response (<35% Ph1 chromosomes) at
the time of cessation maintained his remission status after
more than 7 years after stopping IFN-α. Although very
probable, the presence of BCR-ABL-expressing LSC was
not evaluated in these early studies. It is important to note
that, before the TKI era, IFN-α therapy has induced in a
few patients a prolonged CCyR that have persisted after
the discontinuation of the treatment [98]. Thus, some LSC
could be efficiently controlled in a “dormant” or “inactive”
state in some patients treated with IFN-α alone (but not in
UMRD state), suggesting a particular role for IFN-α in
the therapy of CML. It has been reported that IFN-α could
be more active than imatinib against leukemic progenitors
[99]. Furthermore, in vivo mouse models are suggestive
of its potential to activate quiescent hematopoietic stem
cells [100]. A two-step strategy combining the activation
of dormant LSCs (by IFN-α) and the destruction of recycling cells (by IM) has been suggested [101].
More recently, several clinical pilot studies of
imatinib cessation for patients who achieved sustained
UMRD have been published [102-107]. Overall, these
trials showed that UMRD persists in less than half of
patients. Consequently, a cytogenetic or molecular
relapse was observed in the remaining. Moreover, the
great majority of the patients had previously treated with
IFN-α. The French STIM (STop IMatinib) trial recently
reported the results of imatinib cessation in patients with
sustained UMRD for 2 years or more [21]. In this work,
the molecular relapse-free survival was 41% at 1 year
showing that a molecular relapse occurred in a significant
proportion of patients. In this study, no difference was
observed according to the use or not of IFN-α as first-line
therapy. These clinical trials could not only support the in
vivo existence of LSCs believed to be responsible for the
molecular relapse, but also address the issue of whether
the patients who did not relapse are definitely cured or not.

Persistence of leukemic stem cells
UMRD or complete molecular remission have been
defined as non-detection of BCR-ABL mRNA transcript in
the peripheral blood by RT-qPCR and/or nested RT-PCR
[82]. This assumption is mainly related to the sensitivity
of the method and the characteristics of the biological

cessation. Despite the fact that the decision of IMdiscontinuation was done without the assessment of the
LSC content in these patients, the leukemic stem cells
persistency with active stem cells is highly probable in
these patients. However, in the remaining 40% of patients
who did not relapse, the evaluation of the LSC persistency
might be of major interest. Consequently, in the context
of molecular remission, the characterization of LSCs by
functional assays could be considered in clinical practice.
Overall, these data raise some critical questions.

was observed in patients previously treated by IFN-α
alone as compared with those treated by IM after IFN-α
failure. These data could be indicative of a more effective
eradication of the stem cell compartment in the latter case,
but they must be confirmed on a larger series of patients.
Finally, the major involvement of marrow LSCs in these
patients (2000 CFU-Cs or LTC-ICs analyzed and only a
fraction of the marrow cells assayed) suggest the presence
of a highly active inhibitory process in the bone marrow
niches, maintaining these stem cells in a long-term
dormancy state.

1 - Predictive role of stem cell tests following
targeted therapies

CONCLUSIONS
TKI therapy has dramatically improved the overall
survival in CML and a minority of patients achieved a
sustained state of UMRD. In this context, for clinicians,
patients and socio-economical reasons, the recurrent
question remains the discontinuation of TKI therapies.
Clinical data show that half of the patients will develop
a molecular relapse within a few months after imatinib

We have developed a screening procedure based on
the detection of BCR-ABL mRNA transcripts in CFU-Cs
and LTC-ICs by RT-qPCR that appears more adapted than
FISH to analyze large amount of hematopoietic colonies.
To ensure the reliability of the test, RT-qPCR experiments
have to be carefully controlled at each step of the

amplification process (presence of positive and negative
controls). However, the method can underestimate the
number of BCR-ABL-expressing stem cells because
of to the small number of hematopoietic cells analyzed
(500-4000, according to the size of the colonies) and a
variable transcription of BCR-ABL in Ph1 hematopoietic
progenitors [117]. To be more efficient, we recently
modified the procedure to convert it in a step-by-step
protocol (Figure 3). All LTC-IC assays are now performed
on MS-5/HOXB4 stromal feeders in order to increase the
sensitivity of the test. In addition, LTC-IC experiments are
only carried out when the preliminary CFU-C assays are
negative (absence of BCR-ABL-expressing progenitors).
In the presence of negative CFU-C and LTC-IC assays,
in vivo xenogeneic transplantations in immunodeficient
NOG (NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rγnull) mice can be considered.
In the light of clinical data and stem cell tests, it remains
to be established whether the persistency of residual BCRABL-expressing stem cells (cycling or quiescent) in CML
patients in sustained UMRD represents or not a potential
risk of disease recurrence.

Theoretically, to eradicate a leukemic process, it is
mandatory to eliminate the last leukemic stem cell; this
might be the definitive objective in CML [119]. Nowadays,
many signaling pathways involved in hematopoietic
stem cell maintenance have been described, and a few
inhibitors (some in clinical use) have been identified. It is
then possible to affect more or less specifically LSCs. The
option of targeting CML stem cells in patients in sustained
UMRD must be considered with precaution because of the
probable side effects of the drugs. In this circumstance, a
prior evaluation of the LSC compartment could be useful.
Despite the great success of TKI therapies, many
points have to be clarified such as the mechanisms of
long-term leukemic stem cell dormancy, the role of
an immunomodulatory effect of the treatments, the
relation between CML stem cells and the bone marrow
microenvironment. Moreover, the analysis of BCR-ABLexpressing stem cells in CML patients with sustained
UMRD induced by 2nd generation TKIs must be performed,
as these drugs generate molecular responses more rapidly

than imatinib.

Before discussing this issue, we have to precise
the notion of cure in CML. We can distinguish the
“clinical cure” defined by the absence of relapse from
the “biological cure” defined by the absence of leukemic
cells (including LSCs). This assertion is supported by
our data showing that some patients who appeared
clinically “cured” had persistent LSCs. The detection of
BCR-ABL-expressing clonogenic and LTC-IC-derived
progenitors in patients with sustained UMRD might
confirm the presence of a significant quiescent CML stem
cell compartment. Moreover, it has been shown that the
most primitive LSCs are intrinsically refractory to all
TKIs used in clinical practice. In addition, TKIs might
cause an osteogenic niche homing of LSCs increasing the
quiescent CML stem cell burden. In this context, the use
of IFN-α (to awake dormant LSCs) could be of interest.
Conversely, some studies hypothesize that long-term TKI
therapy (especially with the 2nd generation drugs) could
significantly reduce the malignant stem cell compartment.
It has also been reported that it was not necessary to kill
the last leukemic cell [118]. Nevertheless, TKI therapy
alone seems unlikely to be fully curative, and a risk of
relapse subsists even in sustained UMRD. Consequently,
in this context, the molecular residual disease has to be
thoroughly monitored. In this situation, positive and
negative RT-qPCR areas can be distinguished (Figure
2). The first one corresponds to a “decision-making”
zone and is related to ELN (European leukemia Net)
recommendations. The second is consistent with a nondecisional zone in which the correlation between the
leukemic stem cell persistency and relapse (on- or off-TKI
therapy) remains to be evaluated.
