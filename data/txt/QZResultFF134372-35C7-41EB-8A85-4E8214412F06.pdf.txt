ABSTRACT
Palmitic acid (PA) induces hepatocyte apoptosis and fuels de novo ceramide
synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Myristic acid (MA), a free fatty acid
highly abundant in copra/palmist oils, is a predictor of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) and stimulates ceramide synthesis. Here we investigated the synergism
between MA and PA in ceramide synthesis, ER stress, lipotoxicity and NASH. Unlike
PA, MA is not lipotoxic but potentiated PA-mediated lipoapoptosis, ER stress,
caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release in primary mouse hepatocytes
(PMH). Moreover, MA kinetically sustained PA-induced total ceramide content by
stimulating dehydroceramide desaturase and switched the ceramide profile from
decreased to increased ceramide 14:0/ceramide16:0, without changing medium and
long-chain ceramide species. PMH were more sensitive to equimolar ceramide14:0/
ceramide16:0 exposure, which mimics the outcome of PA plus MA treatment on
ceramide homeostasis, than to either ceramide alone. Treatment with myriocin
to inhibit ceramide synthesis and tauroursodeoxycholic acid to prevent ER stress
ameliorated PA plus MA induced apoptosis, similar to the protection afforded by the
antioxidant BHA, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-Fmk and JNK inhibition. Moreover,
ruthenium red protected PMH against PA and MA-induced cell death. Recapitulating
in vitro findings, mice fed a diet enriched in PA plus MA exhibited lipodystrophy,
hepatosplenomegaly, increased liver ceramide content and cholesterol levels, ER
stress, liver damage, inflammation and fibrosis compared to mice fed diets enriched
in PA or MA alone. The deleterious effects of PA plus MA-enriched diet were largely
prevented by in vivo myriocin treatment. These findings indicate a causal link between
ceramide synthesis and ER stress in lipotoxicity, and imply that the consumption of
diets enriched in MA and PA can cause NASH associated with lipodystrophy.

INTRODUCTION

course of NASH progression. Our findings show that
MA potentiates PA-induced lipoapoptosis in primary
mouse hepatocytes (PMH) and mice fed a diet enriched
in MA and PA exhibits lipodystrophy, increased hepatic
ceramide and cholesterol levels, liver injury, inflammation
and fibrosis, effects that were prevented by inhibition of
the novo ceramide synthesis. These results indicate that
the consumption of diets enriched in MA (copra/palmist
oils) and PA (western/processed foods) may lead to NASH
associated with lipodystrophy.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an
advanced stage of fatty liver disease that can progress
to cirrhosis and liver cancer. NASH is associated with
obesity, lipodystrophy and type-2 diabetes. Hepatocyte
apoptosis is a multifaceted event of relevance for NASH
[1]. Palmitic acid (PA) is the most abundant saturated fatty
acid (SFA) found in Western diets and processed foods and
it is known to cause lipoapoptosis in hepatocytes through
different mechanisms, including endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, JNK activation,
lysosomal membrane permeabilization and death receptor
5 (DR5) activation [2-9]. Palmitoyl-CoA derived from
PA is a precursor of ceramide species, a heterogeneous
family of sphingolipids present in biological membranes
that define specific microdomains involved in signaling
cascades [10-12]. De novo ceramide synthesis takes
place in the ER and begins with the condensation of
the amino acid L-serine with palmitoyl-CoA to form
3-ketosphinganine, in a reaction catalyzed by the ratelimiting enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT).
Reduction of 3-ketosphinganine to sphinganine followed
by acylation with fatty acyl chains of varying lengths by
ceramide synthases (CerS) generates dihydroceramide [13,
14]. Finally, dihydroceramide desaturase (DES) creates a
double trans4-5 bond thereby converting dihydroceramide
into ceramide. Besides its function in membrane
biophysics and function, ceramide has been recognized as
a second messenger involved in multiple cell processes,
including cell stress and cell death, senescence and
differentiation, ER stress, autophagy and disruption of
mitochondrial function [10, 12, 15-17].
Myristic acid (MA) is a SFA found in small amounts
( < 1% of total free fatty acids, FFAs) in animal tissues.
However, MA is highly abundant in milk fat (7-12%)
and, especially, in copra and palmist oils where MA can
reach up to 23% of total fatty acids [18]. MA has recently
been identified as a predictor of NASH, as increased
serum MA levels have been reported in patients with
NASH compared to subjects with simple steatosis and
correlated with fibrosis stage [18]. Dietary MA has been
shown to accumulate in liver and adipose tissue in rats
[19]. Moreover, in situ lipidomic analysis by cluster TOFSIMS imaging revealed the presence of MA and other
SFA in steatotic areas in patients with fatty livers [20].
Furthermore, previous studies reported that the N-terminal
myristoylation of DES increased DES activity in COS-7
cells, thereby stimulating ceramide synthesis [21]. Since
the contribution of ceramide to ER stress caused by PA
has been poorly characterized and because the interplay
between PA and MA in hepatocyte lipoapoptosis has
not been previously examined, the purpose of our study
was to explore whether MA synergizes with PA to cause
lipoapoptosis in hepatocytes. Moreover, mice were
fed a diet enriched in both MA and PA to examine the

RESULTS
PA plus MA cause mild steatosis and generate
selective ceramide species
MA is little abundant in mammalian tissues but
highly enriched in milk fat and, particularly, in copra
and palmist oils where MA accounts for up to 23% of
total free fatty acids. To examine the impact of MA in
modulating the lipotoxic effect of PA, we used MA at mM
concentration to mimic the exposure resulting from the
consumption of diets enriched in MA (e.g. copra/palmist
oils); moreover, to investigate the effect of MA-rich milk
fat-based diet in diabetic cardiomyopathy, Russo et al
incubated cardiomyocytes with 1.5 mM MA [22]. We first
compared the effect of PA, MA and their combination
PA plus MA (PM) in intracellular lipid content in PMH
with respect to that caused by the unsaturated fatty acid
oleic acid (OA). Control treatment (BSA alone) showed
scarce lipid accumulation in the cytoplasm of PMH as
evidenced by oil-red staining, whereas treatments with
PA or MA caused mild steatosis compared to that elicited
by OA (Figure 1A). Combination of PA with OA (PO)
resulted in increased macrovesicular steatosis with respect
to either PA or OA alone, which contrasts with the onset
induced by the combination of PA plus MA (Figure 1A).
Determination of triglyceride (TG) levels indicated that
OA and its combination with PA (PO) promoted more TG
accumulation than either fatty acid alone (Figure 1B). The
effect of MA plus OA in oil-red staining and TG levels
was similar to that caused by PA and OA (not shown).
We next analyzed ceramide levels following FFAs
exposure. Kinetic analyses of ceramide generation
indicated that in contrast to the accumulation of TG, OA
did not increase total ceramide content compared to PA
or MA alone and especially their combination PA plus
MA (PM), whose effect in increasing total ceramide mass
increased over time and peaked after 12 hour of incubation
(Supplemental Figure 1), indicating the ability of PA plus
MA to kinetically sustain ceramide generation. In order
to further analyze the involvement of MA in ceramide
production, cells were treated with a constant dose of PA
and increasing doses of MA, and total ceramide levels

were quantified by HPLC. As seen, total ceramide levels
augmented with increasing MA concentrations, indicating
the potentiation of PA-induced ceramide synthesis by MA
(Figure 1C).
To characterize the individual ceramide species
generated in response to PA plus MA in comparison with
PA, samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The
content of long-chain ceramides (C20-C25) (Supplemental
Figure 2) as well as medium-chain ceramides (18:0 and
18:1) (Figure 1D) induced by PA with or without MA did
not differ significantly, and similar changes were observed
in glucosylceramides (Supplemental Figure 3). As for
shorter chain ceramides, PA alone caused a predominant
increase in ceramide 16:0, which significantly decreased
by the combination of PA and MA (Figure 1D). Moreover,
MA alone induced a significant increase in ceramide 14:0
compared to PA, which further increased (3-4 fold) in the
presence of PA (PM) (Figure 1D). Thus, the combination
PA and MA generated ceramide 14:0 and ceramide 16:0
at equimolar concentration. As expected, treatment of
hepatocytes with OA barely changed ceramide levels.
These findings indicate that PA plus MA modestly
increase TG but enhance ceramide levels whose profile
switches from decreased ceramide 14:0/16:0 by PA alone
to increased ceramide 14:0/16:0 by PA plus MA.

Cerulenin, a specific fatty acid synthase inhibitor [23],
did not affect the lipotoxicity of PA plus MA (not shown),
suggesting that the potentiation of PA-mediated cell death
by MA was not due to newly synthesized PA.
To further characterize the type of cell death caused
by PA and MA we analyzed signs of apoptotic cell death,
including the status of caspase-3 cleavage and cytochrome
c release. As seen, PA plus MA (PM) increased the
level of caspase 3 cleavage as well as the processing of
PARP, a target of active caspase 3, with respect to PA
alone (Figure 2D). Consistent with these findings, PA
plus MA enhanced the release of cytochrome c from
mitochondria to the cytosol (Figure 2E) compared to PA
alone. As expected from these findings the pan-caspase
inhibitor z-VAD-Fmk significantly ameliorated PA plus
MA-induced hepatocellular apoptosis (Figure 2F). In
line with the switched ceramide profile caused by PA
plus MA with respect to PA alone, equimolar ceramide
14:0 and ceramide 16:0, mimicking the combination
of PA with MA, caused more cell death in PMH than
either ceramide species separately (Supplemental Figure
4A). In addition, consistent with previous findings
[21], MA but not PA dose-dependently stimulated DES
activity (Supplemental Figure 4B), in line with the
kinetically sustained generation of total ceramide levels
(Supplemental Figure 1). These findings underscore that
MA potentiates PA-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and
involves the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

MA exacerbates PA-induced lipoapoptosis
PA is a lipotoxic SFA that targets different
organelles, including ER and mitochondria mediating
hepatocyte apoptosis [6, 7]. To address the synergism
between PA and MA in lipoapoptosis, we used
equimolar concentrations of both fatty acids at a relevant
concentration found in western diets (PA) and copra/
palmist oils (MA). Unlike PA, MA alone did not kill PMH
as indicated by propidium iodide and Hoescht staining
(Figure 2A). However, the combination of PA plus MA
significantly increased cell death compared to PA alone
(Figure 2B). As seen, the lipotoxicity of PA augmented
with increasing doses of MA (Figure 2C). Moreover,
while MA did not kill hepatocytes at any concentration,
0.5mM PA in the presence of MA (0.5mM) (black column
Figure 2C) killed more hepatocytes than 0.5mM PA alone
and similar to the degree of cell death caused by 1.0mM
PA alone (light grey column Figure 2C), indicating a
synergistic effect of MA in PA-induced lipotoxicity.
Moreover, cell death determined by the extracellular
release of glutathione-S-transferase (GST), as described
in Supplemental Methods, showed similar results as those
observed by propidium iodide/Hoescht staining. Further,
caspase 3 activity determined by release of 7-amino4-trifluoromethyl coumarin from Ac-DEVD-AMC
(not shown) confirmed the potentiation of PA-induced
lipoapoptosis by MA. Consistent with the role of OA in
increasing TG levels but not ceramide, co-incubation of
PA with OA (PO) prevented cell death by PA (Figure 2B).

MA potentiates PA-induced reactive oxygen
species through de novo ceramide synthesis
Since PA plus MA targeted the mitochondrial
apoptosis pathway, we next addressed whether the
combination of these fatty acids induced the generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As shown, treatment
with PA alone increased ROS generation determined by
dichlorofluorescein-diacetate, and this effect was enhanced
by the combination of PA plus MA (PM) (Figure 3A).
The presence of the unsaturated fatty acid OA prevented
PA-induced ROS production (Figure 3A). To examine
the impact of ROS generation in PA plus MA induced
lipotoxicity, we examined the effect of the antioxidant
BHA. The incubation with BHA suppressed PA and PA
plus MA-mediated ROS overproduction (Figure 3B)
and protected PMH against PA and PA plus MA-induced
cell death (Figure 3C). To determine whether ceramide
synthesis contributed to the oxidative stress caused
by PA with or without MA, PMH were pretreated with
myriocin, a specific SPT inhibitor, which prevents de
novo ceramide synthesis [24]. In line with previous
findings [24], myriocin inhibited SPT activity by 90%
based on the conversion of water-soluble [3H]serine to the
chloroform-soluble product, 3-ketodihydrosphingosine.
Importantly, myriocin significantly reduced ROS

determined the effect of SPT inhibition by myriocin. We
used myriocin to block de novo ceramide synthesis instead
of genetic inactivation of CerS to avoid compensatory
ceramide generation, as described recently in CerS2+/- and
CerS2-/- mice [28, 29]. In line with these data, we observed
that CerS2+/- PMH treated with PA with or without MA
exhibited enhanced ceramide and glucosylceramide levels
and ER stress compared to CerS2+/+ PMH (not shown).
However, myriocin pretreatment prevented the increase
in total ceramide production by PA with or without MA
(Figure 5A), and this outcome resulted in the amelioration
of ER stress markers CHOP and sXBP1 (Figure 5B,
5C). Thus, these findings suggest a link between de novo
ceramide generation and ER stress caused by PA and MA.

MA enhances PA-induced ER stress
ER stress has been involved in the pathogenesis
of NASH [25, 26]. In addition to its role in restoring
homeostasis, persistent ER stress induction triggers
apoptosis. Therefore, we monitored ER stress markers
in PMH after incubation with PA with or without MA.
Exposure of hepatocytes to PA with or without MA for
1-2 hours failed to induce ER stress markers, consistent
with the lack of early ceramide generation (not shown).
However, after 6 hours of incubation, PA induced the
expression of ATF4 (not shown), CHOP and sXBP-1 at the
mRNA level (Figure 4A, 4B). In line with the mild effect
in total ceramide levels, MA alone caused a small increase
in the expression of ER stress markers (Figure 4A, 4B)
that was not enough to cause cell death (Figure 2B, 2C),
suggesting a threshold between ceramide generation,
the induction of ER stress and cell death. However,
MA potentiated the increase in the ER stress markers
induced by PA after 12 hr of incubation (Figure 4A, 4B,
4C), coinciding with the increment of ceramide levels
(Supp Figure 1). Furthermore, consistent with the ability
of OA to protect against PA-induced cell death (Figure
2B), OA reduced PA-mediated induction of ER stress
markers CHOP and sXBP1 (Figure 4A, 4B); in addition
OA prevented PA-induced ROS production (Figure 3A).
These protective effects of OA can be accounted for by its
capacity to prevent ceramide synthesis and the stimulation
of TG accumulation (Figure 1B) thus restraining ceramide
formation. Overall these findings suggest that OA
protected against PA-induced lipoapoptosis by channeling
PA for TG synthesis. In addition, confocal microscopy
analyses indicated the nuclear localization of CHOP in
response to PA and particularly PA plus MA (Figure 4D).
To assess whether ER stress contributed to the potentiation
of the lipotoxicity of PA by MA, we determined the effect
of chemical chaperones, such as tauroursodeoxycholic
acid (TUDCA) that prevents ER stress [27]. As seen,
TUDCA reduced the induction of ER stress markers
CHOP and sXBP1 caused by PA with or without MA
(Figure 4E), and protected PMH against PA plus MAinduced lipotoxicity (Figure 4F). In addition, TUDCA
treatment reduced ROS generation caused by PA with or
without MA (Supplemental Figure 5). However, TUDCA
pretreatment did not abrogate the increase in ceramide
levels caused by PA with or without MA (not shown).
In addition, to examine if de novo ceramide generation
participates in the ER stress caused by PA and MA, we

Ruthenium red protects against PA and MAinduced lipoapoptosis
To further explore the mechanism of mitochondrial
recruitment in the lipoapoptosis induced by PA and
MA, we tested the effect of ruthenium red (RR). RR is
a known inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter
[30], which imports Ca2+ into the mitochondrial matrix to
impact mitochondrial function, including mitochondrial
permeability transition. In line with previous results in
hepatocytes [7], RR protected PMH from PA and PA plus
MA-mediated cell death (Supplementary Figure 4C).
Overall and consistent with previous findings [7], the
data of RR along with the ability of TUDCA to prevent
PA-induced ROS suggest a cross-talk between ER and
mitochondria in the lipoapoptosis induced by PA, likely
via Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria by a RR sensitive
mechanism.

JNK inhibition protect against PA plus MAinduced cell death
As JNK activation has been shown to play a critical
role in PA-mediated lipotoxicity, we next checked the
efficacy of JNK inhibition by SP600125. As shown,
SP600125 protected primary hepatocytes against PA with
or without MA-mediated cell death as well as the expected
JNK activation (Supplementary Figure 6). Interestingly,
the effect of SP600125 was not potentiated by BHA and
TUDCA (not shown), suggesting that JNK activation,
ROS generation and ER stress converge in a common
pathway.

diet results in lipodystrophy and progressive liver

In all cases, required amount of essential fatty acids was
ensured by supplementing diets with C18:3 n-3 [19]. A
singularity of these custom-made diets compared to high
fat diets typically used in obesity studies is that mice
did not become obese in any condition (Figure 6A) and
exhibited reduced epididymal adipose tissue that was
especially pronounced with the diet enriched in PA plus
MA, indicating the induction of nutritional lipodystrophy.
Moreover, mice fed the combination PA plus MA diet
displayed hepatosplenomegaly (Figure 6A). Blood serum
analyses showed increased AST and ALT levels in mice
fed PA diet that was enhanced by the combination PA

plus MA diet indicating increased liver damage (Figure
6B). H&E analyses showed normal appearance in mice
fed the diet enriched in MA compared to mice fed diet
enriched in PA, which exhibited parenchymal architecture
disorganization; these effects were exacerbated in mice
fed PA plus MA and were accompanied by inflammatory
cell infiltration (Figure 6B) and myeloperoxidase staining.
Chronic feeding the PA-enriched diet caused liver
fibrosis as indicated by Sirius red staining and increased
Col1A1 mRNA levels (Figure 6C), and these effects were
magnified in mice fed the combination diet enriched in

DISCUSSION

cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF compared to mice fed diet
enriched in PA (Figure 6D). These findings suggest that
the consumption of diets enriched in PA and MA cause
lipodystrophy, liver injury, inflammation and fibrosis.

PA is one of the most abundant saturated fatty
acids present in western diets, which is known to cause
lipotoxicity by multifaceted mechanisms, including
mitochondrial dysfunction, lysosomal destabilization and
ER stress [4-7]. Here we describe for the first time the
potentiation of PA-induced lipoapoptosis by MA, another
SFA, which unlike PA is not lipotoxic. As MA is highly
enriched in milk fat and, particularly, in copra/palmist oils,
we exposed hepatocytes to a concentration range of MA
mimicking that found in these foods and derivatives. While
the onset of ER stress and the recruitment of mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway induced by PA are potentiated by MA,
in line with previous observations with PA alone [6, 7], we
focused on the contribution of ceramide synthesis as this
particular aspect has not been examined in the presence
of PA and MA. The role of ceramide in PA-induced ER
stress and lipotoxicity remains poorly characterized has
been examined mainly in liver cancer cells and CHO cells
[31, 32].
PA fuels de novo ceramide synthesis by generating
the d18:1 carbon backbone sphinganine from the
reduction of 3-ketosphinganine, which is formed by the
condensation of palmitoyl-CoA with serine in a reaction
catalyzed by SPT; the subsequent acylation of sphinganine
with fatty acyl chains of varying lengths generates
different ceramide species. Hence, PA not only supports
d18:1 sphinganine formation but is the substrate of CerS6,
which catalyzes the acylation of sphinganine with PA to
generate ceramide 16:0 [13, 14]. In the presence of PA
plus MA, two major changes in ceramide homeostasis are
observed. First, MA promotes ceramide synthesis from
PA and kinetically sustains higher total ceramide levels.
In addition, MA competes with PA for the acylation of
d18:1 sphinganine, resulting in decreased ceramide 16:0
and higher ceramide 14:0 level, leading to equimolar
ceramide14:0 and ceramide 16:0 generation. In line with
the reported activation of DES upon its myristoylation at
the N-terminus [21], we observed increased stimulation
of DES activity using NBD-dehydroceramide 12:0
as substrate, accounting for the sustained increase in
total ceramide levels over time. The relative modest
generation of ceramide 14:0 by MA alone could be due
to the limitation of endogenous PA levels to support d18:1
sphinganine generation to be acylated with MA. Although
MA can also act as a substrate for SPT to generate
d16:0 sphingolipids, this process is limited by the lower
affinity of the SPT complex for MA compared to that
of PA [12, 18, 32, 33]. The expression of the catalytic
subunit STPLC3 broadens the substrate specificity of
SPT allowing utilization of myristoyl-CoA for synthesis
of d16:0 carbon backbone [34]. However, expression
of SPTLC3 subunit is barely detectable in normal liver,
although its levels increase in hepatocellular carcinoma
[35].

Mice fed PA plus MA-enriched diet exhibit
increased liver ceramide content and ER stress
We next analyzed the liver lipid content following
the consumption of PA plus MA-enriched diet. Mice
fed diets enriched in PA with or without MA showed
significant increase in liver cholesterol levels (Figure
7A), without change in the TG content, in line with
the mild hepatic steatosis analyzed by Oil-red staining
(Figure 6E). Moreover, the hepatic content of FFA did not
increase in mice fed the diets enriched in PA, MA or their
combination (Figure 7A). However, total hepatic ceramide
levels significantly increase in mice fed PA-enriched diet
and this effect was exacerbated by the presence of PA
plus MA (Figure 7A). This outcome was accompanied by
increased expression of CerS6 by PA plus MA compared
to diet enriched in PA alone (Figure 7B) and this specific
CerS form exhibits preference for 14:0 and 16:0 fatty
acids. In addition, PA plus MA decreased the expression of
CerS2 and CerS4, which are responsible for the synthesis
of C22-C24 and C20 ceramide species, respectively.
Gene expression analyses of enzymes involved in lipid
metabolism indicated increased expression of the catalytic
subunit of SPT, Sptlc2, and sphingomyelin synthase
Sgms1 by diets enriched in PA with or without MA
(Figure 7C). In addition, Hmgcr and Srebf2 involved in
cholesterol synthesis increased in PA and PA plus MAfed mice (Figure 7C). Moreover, fatty acid transporter
Cd36 expression increased significantly in mice fed PA
and PA plus MA diet (Figure 7C). Interestingly, mice fed
PA plus MA-enriched diet exhibited reduced expression of
Scd1, and Srebf1, which are involved in FFA synthesis and
esterification. These data indicate that hepatic fatty acids
are preferentially channeled for ceramide synthesis rather
than TG formation. Consistent with in vitro findings, PAenriched diet induced a marked elevation in ER stress
markers, which further increased by the combination of
PA plus MA (Figure 7D).
In line with findings in PMH, treatment of mice
with myriocin prevented PA plus MA-induced ceramide
generation and cholesterol content (Figure 7A), resulting
in lower liver damage determined by decreased serum
ALT levels and H&E analyses (Figure 6B), as well as
attenuation of fibrosis reflected by Sirius Red staining
and decreased Col1A1 mRNA levels (Figure 6C) and
decreased expression of inflammation markers (Figure 6
D). Overall, these findings further support the contribution
of de novo ceramide synthesis in progressive liver disease
caused by feeding diets enriched in PA plus MA.

Figure 8: Schematic proposal of the molecular events involved in the lipotoxic effects of PA and the potentiation by
MA. PA fuels ceramide synthesis by providing sphinganine in a reaction catalyzed by SPT. MA in turn potentiates ceramide generation by

stimulating the activity of DES, and therefore the combination of MA plus PA results in kinetically sustained de novo ceramide production.
This event is upstream of the induction of ER stress, which in turn recruits the mitochondrial apoptosis program eliciting ROS generation
and caspase activation, leading to hepatocyte apoptosis. On the hand right side, we show the different specific inhibitors used to interrupt
this signaling cascade. In addition to ceramide generation, PA is also known to activate other cellular events, including lysosomal membrane
permeabilization (LMP) and activation of death receptor 5 (DR5), which then contribute to PA-induced lipoapoptosis. While myriocin
blocks the central events shown (blue rectangle) it is not expected to interfere with LMP and DR5 activation. Further work is required to
examine the involvement of ceramide synthesis in the recruitment and activation of LMP and DR5 by saturated fatty acids.

The switch in ceramide profile by PA vs PA plus
MA resulting in increased ceramide 14:0 and decreased
ceramide 16:0 is of relevance in the lipotoxicity of PMH.
Interestingly, PMH are more sensitive to equimolar
ceramide 14:0 and ceramide 16:0, mimicking the profile
elicited by PA plus MA, than to either ceramide species
alone. This increased susceptibility may reflect an
emerging prosurvival role of ceramide 16:0, which has
been recently described in cancer cells by regulating
ER stress response [36]. While MA is not hepatotoxic
by itself, it has been recently reported that myristate is
cardiotoxic and induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in an
autophagy-dependent manner [22]. Further investigation
will be required to decipher the tissue specific cytotoxic
potential of MA and whether it is related to differential
ceramide species generation.
The potentiation of PA-induced lipoapoptosis by
MA involves ER stress and mitochondrial recruitment
by a mechanism dependent of mitochondrial Ca2+ import
sensitive to RR. Moreover, antioxidant BHA and caspase
blockade protect against PA plus MA-mediated cell
death. Inhibition of ER stress by TUDCA protects against
PA and MA-induced cell death but does not abrogate
ceramide synthesis. Furthermore myriocin, a specific
SPT inhibitor, protects against PA plus MA-induced
ceramide generation and subsequent ER stress induction
and hepatocyte apoptosis. Overall, these findings, indicate
that PA plus MA-induced ceramide generation is upstream
of ER stress and mitochondrial recruitment. While
these findings suggest a de novo ceramide synthesisER stress-mitochondria axis contributing to PA-induced
lipoapoptosis with potentiation by MA, protection with
myriocin or TUCDA is partial, indicating the participation
of other pathways independent of de novo ceramide
synthesis and ER stress. In this regard, PA has been
shown to elicit hepatocyte apoptosis through lysosomal
membrane permeabilization [3, 37] or DR5 activation
[8,9], which could account for the partial protection
afforded by myriocin. In addition, a direct effect of
ceramide in mitochondria causing ROS and apoptosis has
been reported in different cell tpes [13, 38-40], which may
underlie the residual cell death in the presence of TUDCA.
Further work will be required to examine the contribution
of ceramide in PA-induced lysosomal membrane
permeabilization and DR5 activation (Figure 8).
The role of ceramide in PA-induced lipotoxicity and
ER stress is controversial. For instance, Listenberger et
al. claimed that PA-induced cell death in CHO cells did
not depend on ceramide synthesis [31]. However, the
inhibition of SPT and CerS inhibition with L-cycloserine
and fumonisin B1, respectively, decreased caspase-3
activity and reduced DNA degradation. Moreover, Wei
et al. discarded the contribution of de novo synthesized
ceramide in PA-induced lipotoxicity in the H4IIE hepatic
cell line treated with fumonisin B1 [32]. As expected,
fumonisin B1 resulted in increased dihydrophingosine
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

generation by PA, which has been shown to mediate the
toxicity of fumonisin B1 in different cell types [41, 42].
In addition to these possibilities, the difference between
tumor cell lines and primary hepatocytes could also
contribute to the final outcome.
To explore the relevance of the findings in PMH, we
fed mice diets enriched in PA with or without MA. In line
with the in vitro observations, the chronic consumption of
these diets, mimicking the ingestion of copra/palmist oils
and western foods, resulted in increased liver ceramide
content and ER stress, effects that were exacerbated
by the combination PA plus MA, and this outcome was
accompanied by lipodystrophy, enhanced liver injury,
inflammation and fibrosis. Consistent with the findings
in PMH, there was negligible macrovesicular steatosis
indicating that dietary PA and MA were diverted from TG
synthesis and preferentially converted in ceramide species.
This outcome mirrored the increased expression of the
catalytic subunit of the SPT complex SPTLC2 and CerS6,
which exhibit preferential affinity for MA and PA, as well
as the downregulation of SREBP-1 and SCD-1. Besides
ceramide accumulation, PA plus MA diet also increased
liver cholesterol levels, which may be consequence of
ceramide-induced ER stress and subsequent activation
of the transcription factor SREBP-2 and the enzyme
catalyzing the rate-limited step in cholesterol synthesis,
HMGCoAR. Thus, despite absence of macrosteatosis and
TG deposition, nutritional intake of PA plus MA resulted
in the selective accumulation of ceramide and cholesterol
that may account for the observed hepatomegaly. Another
key feature of this feeding regimen was the marked loss
of adipose tissue, underlying the nutritional lipodystrophy
induction by PA plus MA, which contrasts with the
outcome described with high fat diets typically used for
obesity and glucose homeostasis studies, suggesting that
the nutritional fat was diverted to the liver for conversion
into ceramide. Interestingly, our findings are similar to
those reported recently in mice fed an atherogenic diet
enriched in cholesterol (1.25%) with the loss of adipose
tissue, accumulation of liver cholesterol, inflammation,
fibrosis and liver injury [43].
These in vivo findings may have important
implications. While most studies investigating the
effects of SFA have focused in coronary heart disease
and atherosclerosis [44], our results imply that people
consuming diets enriched in PA and MA may develop
lipodystrophy and chronic liver disease, characterized
by the lack of TG accumulation and macrovesicular
steatosis and the preferential accumulation of ceramide
and cholesterol levels, contributing to hepatomegaly
and liver injury. Moreover, unlike other high fat diets
consumption of diets enriched in PA plus MA does not
result in increased body weight although it induces
inflammation and fibrosis indicative of progressive
NAFLD. Interestingly, recent studies have reported that
children of Asian origin exhibit similar abnormal liver

severe fibrosis compared to Caucasians despite decreased
body mass index [45]. Further investigation is needed
to ascertain whether differential nutritional intake and
consumption of PA plus MA in this children population
can account for this outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice, hepatocyte isolation and treatments

Ceramide species analysis with mass spectrometry

Wild type mice (C57BL/6J, Charles River
Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) and CerS2+/- mice
(obtained from Drs. A. Futerman and S. Summers) were
used as the source of PMH and were isolated as previously
described [46]. PMH were treated with PA, MA or OA
alone or in combination at equimolar concentrations
(0.25-1mM) for 1-12 hours. Stock solutions of PA,
MA or OA were prepared as described [6] and the final
working concentrations were made with 0.5-1% (w/v)
fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA, Roche).
FFA:BSA ratio ranged from 3:1 to 6:1 depending on
the final FFA concentration. High FFA:BSA ratio has
been observed in states of insulin resistance and obesity,
two risk factors for NASH [47]. In some cases, PMH
were treated with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA,
50 - 200 µM) (Sigma-Aldrich) in absolute ethanol,
z-VAD-FMK (5 - 15 µM) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), myriocin (20 µM) (Enzo
Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) in NaOH (50 mM) and
DMSO (0.1%), tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, 25
µM) (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA), ruthenium red (RR, 10
µM) and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (20µΜ). Cell death,
lipodomic analyses, total ceramide levels, DES activity
from NBD-dihydroceramide C12; ROS generation and
determination of ER stress are described in Supplemental
Material section.

Lipids from homogenate samples were extracted
with methanol:chloroform isolation (1:2, v/v). Mass
spectrometry analysis of lipid species was performed in
the Research Unit on Bioactive Molecules at the Institute
of Advanced Chemistry of Catalonia (IQAC). Cells or
tissue homogenates were pelleted, washed in PBS, and
transferred to glass vials. Sphingolipid extracts were
spiked with internal standards (N-dodecanoylsphingosine,
N-dodecanoylglucosylsphingosine,
and
N-dodecanoylsphingosylphosphorylcholine,
0.2nmol
each) and analysed in a Waters Aquity UPLC system
connected to a Waters LCT Premier orthogonal accelerated
time of flight mass spectrometer (Waters, Millford, MA)
operated in positive electrospray ionisation mode. The
analytical column was a 100mm x 2.1mm i.d., 1.7μm C8
Acquity UPLC BEH (Waters). The two mobile phases
were phase A: water/formic acid (500/1 v/v); phase B:
methanol/formic acid (500/1 v/v), both also contained
5mM ammonium formate. A linear gradient was
programmed— 0.0min: 80% B; 3min: 90% B; 6min: 90%
B; 15min: 99% B; 18min: 99% B; 20min: 80% B. The
flow rate was 0.3mL/min. The column was maintained at
30°C. Quantification was carried out using the extracted
ion chromatogram of each compound, using 50mDa
windows. The linear dynamic range was determined by
injecting standard mixtures.

Ceramide analysis by HPLC

Determination of dihydroceramide desaturase
and serine palmitoyltransferase activities

Cellular ceramide levels were determined by
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after
derivatization of the sphingoid base with O-phthaldehyde
following deacylation of ceramide, as described
previously [46]. Briefly, cells were collected in PBS
and lipids were extracted with methanol:chloroform
(1:2, v/v) isolation. The organic phase was resuspended
in 250 µL of 1 N KOH in methanol, and incubated 1
hour at 100°C, yielding free sphingoid base, followed
by derivatization with O-phthaldehyde. Samples were
centrifuged and analyzed by HPLC in a reverse phase C18
column (Teknokroma) using a Gilson fluorimetric detector
(Middleton, WI) with an excitation wavelength of 252 nm
and an emission wavelength of 483 nm. The mobile phase

The determination of DES activity was performed
as described in detail previously [21]. Briefly, cell extracts
were incubated with NBD-dihydroceramide C12:0 and the
resulting synthesized ceramide 12:0 was resolved from
the precursor dihydroceramide by HPTLC as described
previously [21]. SPT activity was determined as described
previously [24], based on the conversion of watersoluble [3H]serine to the chloroform-soluble product,
3-ketodihydrosphingosine.
