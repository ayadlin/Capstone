Abstract
FOXP3 is inactivated in breast cancer cells by a number of
mechanisms, including somatic mutations, deletion, and
epigenetic silencing. Because the mutation and deletion are
usually heterozygous in the cancer samples, it is of interest
to determine whether the gene can be induced for the
purpose of cancer therapy. Here, we report that anisomycin,
a potent activator of activating transcription factor (ATF) 2,
and c-Jun-NH2-kinase, induces expression of FoxP3 in both
normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells. The
induction is mediated by ATF2 and c-Jun. Targeted mutation
of ATF2 abrogates both constitutive and inducible expression
of FoxP3 in normal epithelial cells. Both ATF2 and c-Jun
interact with a novel enhancer in the intron 1 of the FoxP3
locus. Moreover, shRNA silencing of ATF2 and FoxP3 reveals
an important role of ATF2-FoxP3 pathway in the anisomycininduced apoptosis of breast cancer cells. A low dose of
anisomycin was also remarkably effective in treating established mammary tumor in the mice. Our data showed that
FoxP3 can be reactivated for cancer therapy. [Cancer Res

Materials and Methods

Introduction
The overwhelming majority of tumor suppressor genes are
autosomal, and their inactivations involve two genetic events (1–4).
The best defined two hits of the tumor suppressors in cancer cells
are usually irreversible, such as deletion or mutations (3, 4). More
recently, however, it has become increasingly clear that epigenetic
inactivation of tumor suppressors plays a critical role in
inactivating tumor suppressor genes (5). On the other hand, due
to X-inactivation, the X-linked tumor suppressor genes are
operatively hemizygous, and can be inactivated by a single hit
(6). This notion has been substantiated by the recent identification
of two tumor suppressor genes, FoxP3 for breast cancer (7) and
WTX for Wilms’ tumor (8). Because the majority of mutations and/
or deletions associated with X-linked tumor suppressor genes are
heterozygous (7, 8), most cancer cells have a wild-type (WT) allele
that has not been irreversibly inactivated (7).

An important aspect of tumor therapy is how to restore the
function of tumor suppressors. For those with two irreversible
genetic changes, such as p53, this has been technically
challenging, although a pharmaceutical restoration of mutant
protein function has been reported (9). Because X-linked tumor
suppressor genes are operationally hemizygous, only one allele is
subject to genetic selection in cancer cells. The other allele is
therefore genetically intact and can potentially be induced to
suppress tumor growth. Based on this concept, we searched for a
biochemical pathway that can be activated to induce FOXP3
expression in breast cancer cells. Here, we report that anisomycin,
which is commonly used to induce stress responses of cells,
induces expression of FOXP3 in breast cancer cell lines. Our
biochemical and genetic analyses revealed that activating
transcription factor (ATF)2, which was recently shown to be a
tumor suppressor gene in the mouse (10), is essential for the
induction of FoxP3 and FoxP3-mediated apoptosis. Moreover,
ATF-2 forms heterodimer with c-Jun to activate transcription of
FoxP3. These data show a novel function of ATF2 in the
expression of FoxP3 in the epithelial cells and suggest a novel
approach for the therapy of breast cancer.

Antibodies and reagents. Anti–ATF-2 (20F1), phospho-ATF2-(Thr71),
and activated caspase-3 were purchased from Cell Signaling, Inc. Other
vendors are as follows: anti-Foxp3 (eBioscience; #14-5779-82); and anti–hactin (I-19), c-Jun (NX), and phosphor-c-Jun (KM-1; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.). Chemicals SP600125, SB203580, and PD98059 were
purchased from CalBiochem, Inc., whereas anisomycin was purchased
from Sigma, Inc.
Experimental animals. Mice heterozygous for Atf2 null mutation
(Atf2 tm1Glm /Atf2 +129S2/SvPas; ref. 11) were revived from the frozen embryo
bank in The Jackson Laboratory. Heterozygous mice were crossed to
produce Atf2+/+ and Atf2 / littermates. BALB/c mice were purchased from
Charles River through a National Cancer Institute Subcontract. All studies
involving animal has been approved by University Committee on Use and
Care of Animals at University of Michigan.
Preparation of mammary epithelial cell culture. Mouse mammary fat
pads were removed from 6- to 8-wk-old virgin female mice and minced
into small pieces. After collagenase digestion at 37jC in a shaking incubator
in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS, cells were sieved through a 70-Am
cell strainer (BD Falcon) to obtain a single-cell suspension. The cells
were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
10 ng/mL epithelial growth factor. At day 3 of culture, fibroblast cells
were removed by a short digestion with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA as less
adherent cells.
Measurement of FOXP3 transcripts. Total cDNA were prepared
from breast cancer cell lines or epithelial cultures. The levels of FOXP3
mRNA were measured by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) under
two conditions. Full-length encoding regions were analyzed by agarose

electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes with transferred
proteins were incubated with primary antibody followed by incubation with
horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence reaction using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham
Biosciences) was detected by film.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was carried out according to a
published procedure (13). Briefly, the vehicle or 2-h anisomycin-treated
4T1 cells were sonicated and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. The
anti–phospho-c-Jun or anti–phosphor-ATF2 antibodies or control rabbit
IgG were used to pull down chromatin associated with these proteins. The
amounts of the specific DNA fragments were quantitated by real-time PCR
and normalized against the genomic DNA preparation from the same cells.
Immunoflurensence staining. TSA cells were treated or left untreated
with vehicle DMSO or 50 ng/mL of anisomycin for 24 h. After that, the cells
were fixed by methanol, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X100, and stained
with rabbit antibody against cleaved Caspase 3 (Cell signaling, #9661s)
overnight. The stained cells were then visualized with Cy3-conjugated antirabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory).
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell
viability assay has been described in details (14).
DNA contents Anisomycin-treated or control cells were stained by
Propidium Iodide using ‘‘PI/RNase Staining Buffer’’ from BD Biosciences
according to the manufacturer’s manual.

Induction of FoxP3 by anisomycin. We have recently shown
that the expression of FoxP3 cDNA leads to rapid cell death of
breast cancer cell lines (7, 15). These results raised the possibility
that the induction of FoxP3 may represent a novel therapeutic
approach for the treatment of breast cancer. When we screened for
drugs that induce FoxP3 expression in mammary tumor cell lines,
we observed a rapid induction of FoxP3 mRNA by anisomycin. As
shown in Fig. 1A, significant levels of the FoxP3 transcripts were
induced in a mouse mammary tumor cell line, TSA, as early as 4
hours after anisomycin treatment. Similar effects were observed in
another mouse mammary tumor cell line 4T1 and human breast
cancer cell line MCF-7 (Fig. 1B), which we showed to harbor
the WT FOXP3 gene (7). In contrast, treatment of phorbol 12myristate 13-acetate (PMA) did not result in any induction of
FoxP3 (Fig. 1B). Because higher doses of anisomycin can inhibit
translation, we tested induction of the FoxP3 protein by Western
blot. As shown in Fig. 1C, low doses of anisomycin induced high
levels of FoxP3 protein, which indicated that activation of FoxP3
locus can be achieved at doses that did not prevent translation
of the FoxP3 protein. Importantly, the induction of FoxP3 protein
can be prevented by FoxP3 shRNA. These data not only proved
the specificity of Western blot but also confirmed that the
accumulation of FoxP3 protein depends on induction of FoxP3
mRNA.
Involvement of ATF2, c-Jun-NH2-kinase in FoxP3 induction.
As a first step to identify the mechanism by which anisomycin
induced FoxP3, we treated mammary tumor cell line with
anisomycin in conjunction with inhibitors of overlapping specificity, including ATF-2/c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP10096
(SP), p38a inhibitor SB203580 (SB), and p41/42 MAP kinase
inhibitor PD9786 (PD). As shown in Fig. 2A, SP completely
prevented the induction of FoxP3. On the other hand, SB and PD
had little effect. These data raised the possibility that ATF-2 and
JNK pathways may be involved in the induction of FoxP3 by
anisomycin.
To test this hypothesis, we generated lentiviral vectors
expressing shRNA for JNK1/2 or ATF2. The efficacy of shRNA

silencing and the effect of the silencing on anisomycin-mediated
induction of FoxP3 is shown in Fig. 2B. These data showed that
silencing either JNK or ATF2 resulted in abrogation of the
induction of the FoxP3 transcripts and protein by anisomycin.
These data provide important genetic evidence for the
involvement of JNK and ATF2 in anisomycin-induced FoxP3
expression.
Interestingly, a recent study showed that mice with heterozygous
deletion of the ATF2 gene developed spontaneous mammary
tumors (10). Because FoxP3 heterozygous mutants have the
same phenotype, it is intriguing that ATF2 may be responsible

for constitutive and/or inducible expressions of FoxP3 in
mammary epithelial cells. To address this issue, we obtained
ATF2+/ mice from the frozen embryo bank of The Jackson
Laboratory. The ATF2+/+ and the ATF2 / mice were obtained
by F1 cross. A previous report indicated that the only a small
fraction of the ATF2 / mice survive to adulthood (11). We
obtained two ATF2 / females, from which we obtained two
independent primary mammary epithelial cell cultures (Fig. 2D).
The epithelial origin of the cultures was shown by the expression of
CK19. Because T cells are the major source of FoxP3 transcripts
in vivo, we also confirmed that the primary culture has no T-cell

contamination by the lack of CD3 transcripts (Fig. 2D ). WT
epithelial cultures expressed significant amounts of Foxp3
transcripts, which were further induced by the treatment of
anisomycin. ATF2 / cells had no detectable FoxP3 transcripts
and did not express FoxP3 after stimulation by anisomycin.
These data revealed an essential role for ATF2 in both
constitutive and inducible expressions of FoxP3 in normal
epithelial cells. On the other hand, the thymocytes from the
ATF2 / mice had normal number of CD4+FoxP3+ T cells (data
not shown). Therefore, the function of ATF2 in FoxP3 expression
seems to be epithelia specific.
Identification of the FoxP3 enhancer associated with ATF2
and c-Jun. To study the mechanism of ATF2/JNK-mediated
induction of FoxP3, we carried out ChIP to identify an
anisomycin-inducible binding site of the FoxP3 locus. To identify
specific ATF2 binding sites, we treated the 4T1 cell line with or
without anisomycin and carried out ChIP with either control IgG
or anti–p-ATF2 antibodies. Because JNK regulate transcription by
phosphorylation of c-Jun (16), we used anti–phospho-c-Jun
antibodies in the ChIP. To identify the FoxP3 sequence associated

www.aacrjournals.org

with p-ATF2 and p-c-Jun, we first analyzed the 5¶ sequence of the
FoxP3 gene and identified 14 potential AP1 and cAMP-responsive
element binding protein sites. PCR primers were designed across
the 10.4 kb regions, and the amounts of each PCR product were
normalized against that amplified from the input DNA. The
quantitative real-time PCR results were shown in Fig. 3A, whereas
the PCR products from two major peaks were shown in Fig. 3B.
These data reveal two potential sites for ATF2/cJun interaction.
The first is hereby called P2, which is 4.8 kb 5¶ of exon 1. The
second and the stronger binding site P10 is 4.2 kb 3¶ of exon 1.
Importantly, whereas the P2 ATF2/cJun association is not
inducible by anisomycin, the P10 binding is enhanced by >2fold by anisomycin. Moreover, comparison of mouse and human
FoxP3 sequence revealed that the P10, but not the P2 site, is
highly conserved (Supplementary Fig. S1). Therefore, we focused
on the potential significance of P10 as the site for p-ATF2 and pcJun interaction.
Sequencing comparison identified a typical AP1 site within
the P10 (Supplementary Fig. S1). To directly show interactions of
ATF2 and c-Jun to the FoxP3 promoter, we radiolabeled an

oligonucleotide probe containing conserved AP1 site as well as two
control oligos with mutations in the AP1 site and tested their
binding to nuclear extracts. As shown in Fig. 3C, the nuclear
extracts from anisomycin-treated, but not those from the
untreated, 4T1 cells showed strong interaction with the WT P10
probe. The specificity was confirmed as mutations in the AP1 site
significantly reduced the binding. Furthermore, the involvement of
ATF2 and c-Jun was shown as their specific antibodies abolished
the binding of nuclear extracts to WT probe. Thus, both ChIP and
electrophoresis mobility-shift assay identify a specific activator
protein (AP1) site with 4.2 kb 3¶ of the TSS, which binds to both
p-ATF2 and p-cJun by anisomycin-inducible fashion.
To test whether the P10 sequence was a functional FoxP3
enhancer, we generated a series of constructs consisting of the
basal promoter and putative enhancer elements. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. S2, a 265 bp sequence 5¶s of TSS of the FoxP3
locus plus 50 bp down-stream of TSS is sufficient to convey a
significant basal promoter activity. This fragment is therefore
chosen to measure the enhancer activity. As shown in Fig. 4,
addition of three copies of P2 fragment increased the promoter
activity by f2-fold, which suggests that P2 is at best a weak
enhancer. Inclusion of three copies of P10 sequences, however,
increased the Foxp3 promoter activity by 10-fold. Surprisingly, this
seems unidirectional as the inversion of the P10 fragment
eliminated its enhancer activity. Moreover, the involvement of
AP1 site in P10 was confirmed as a mutation of the AP1 site
significantly reduced the enhance activity. Moreover, addition of P2
to P10 failed to further enhance the promoter activity. Taken
together, our data showed that anisomycin induced ATF2/c-Jun
interaction with a specific enhancer within the intron 1 of the
FoxP3 gene.
A critical role for ATF2-FoxP3 pathway in anisomycininduced apoptosis and the therapy of breast cancer. Our recent

studies have shown that the induced expression of FoxP3 caused
apoptosis of breast cancer cell lines (7, 11, 15). To determine
whether anisomycin treatment caused apoptosis of breast cancer
cells, we measured the cytotoxic effect of anisomycin on several of
breast cancer cell lines, by MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 5A, both
mouse (TSA) and human breast cancer cell lines (BT474, MCF-7)
were highly susceptible to anisomycin, with an IC50 between 50 and
100 ng/mL. The reduced viability is due to apoptosis as revealed by
the increased expression of active caspase 3 in TSA cells (Fig. 5B,
top) with less than 2C DNA contents (Fig. 5B, bottom). Given the
critical role for ATF2 in FoxP3 induction, we tested the
contribution of ATF2 to anisomycin-induced cell death by
comparing the dose response to anisomycin in cells transfected
with either vector alone or those with ATF2 shRNA. As shown in
Fig. 5C and D, ATF2 and FoxP3 shRNAs increased resistance to
anisomycin by nearly 3-fold. These data show a critical role for the
ATF2-FoxP3 pathway in anisomycin-induced cell death of breast
cancer cells.
To test whether induction of FoxP3 by ATF2-FoxP3 pathway can
be explored for breast cancer therapy, we injected the TSA cell line
into the mammary pad. Seventeen days later, when the cancer cells
established locally, the mice were treated with either vehicle
control or anisomycin. As shown in Fig. 6, the growth of the TSA
tumor cells in syngeneic mammary pad is abrogated by
anisomycin. These data show the potential of ATF2-FoxP3 pathway
in the therapeutic development for breast cancer.

Discussion
FOXP3 is an X-linked gene that is subject to X-inactivation
(7, 17). Our inquiry into the high incidence of spontaneous
mammary tumors in mice heterozygous for the Scurfy mutation led
to the identification of it as the first X-linked tumor suppressor for

breast cancer in mouse and in woman (7). FOXP3 acts as a
transcriptional repressor of oncogenes such as ErbB2 and SKP2
(7, 15). Moreover, ectopic expression of FOXP3 cause an apoptosis
of breast cancer cells (7). These data showed that the induction of
FOXP3 in the tumor cells may prove valuable for the treatment of
breast cancer.
Because the one WT allele was not irreversibly inactivated in the
overwhelming majority of breast cancer samples analyzed (7), it is
theoretically possible to reactivate the expression of FOXP3 locus
for the treatment of breast cancer. The data presented herein
showed such reactivation by anisomycin.
We observed that anisomycin, a drug commonly used to activate
MAP kinases, rapidly induced FOXP3 expression in multiple breast
cancer cell lines tested. Using shRNA specific for Jnk and Atf2, we
showed that the Jnk and Atf2 genes are required for the induction
of FoxP3 expression. Moreover, biochemical analysis allowed us to
identify critical cis-element involved in the induction of FoxP3 and
that this cis-element interacts with c-Jun and ATF2 to cause the
activation of the FoxP3 gene. It is worth considering whether the
effect of anisomycin can be related to reactivation of X-inactivated
FoxP3, given recent reports of chromatin modification-dependence
of c-Jun–induced transcriptions (18, 19).

www.aacrjournals.org

Using mammary epithelial culture isolated from WT and
ATF2 / mice, we showed that the targeted mutation of Atf2 not
only reduced the basal levels of FoxP3 transcripts in the mammary
epithelial cells, but also eliminated its induction by anisomycin.
Therefore, ATF2 plays an essential role in both constitutive and
inducible expression of FoxP3. It is of great interest to note that
mice heterozygous for Atf2-null allele spontaneously developed
mammary tumors (10). The similarity in tumor onset suggests that
the lack of FoxP3 expression may be an underlying cause for the
spontaneous mammary tumors, although the Atf2 +/ mice
available to us is in 129/SV background, which is not suitable to
address this issue.
FOXP3 is expressed in both T cells and epithelial cells (7, 20, 21).
Because the majority of the Atf2 / mice die shortly after
birth (11), a systemic analysis of the effect on expression of
FOXP3 in the T-cell lineage remained to be determined. However,
our preliminary analysis suggested that Atf2 is not essential for
FOXP3 expression in the thymocytes (data not shown). Therefore,
ATF2 may play different roles in different lineages. Consistent with
this notion, both cis-element and the trans-activating factors
identified here differ from what were reported in FoxP3 induction
in T cells (22–25).

Finally, an important but unresolved issue is how to reactivate
tumor suppressor function in the tumor cells. Classic tumor
suppressors are inactivated by two irreversible hits (2). Therefore,
despite an elegant recent approach (9), restoring the function of
classic tumor suppressors remains a major challenge for cancer
therapy. On the other hand, recent data from our group and that of
another indicated that X-linked tumor suppressor genes are subject
to X-inactivation (7, 8). Because X-inactivated genes are not subject
to selection during tumor growth and because deletion and
mutation found in the majority of the cases are heterozygous (7, 8),
it may be possible to reactivate FOXP3 for the treatment of breast
cancer. In this regard, we have shown that anisomycin cause
apoptosis in an ATF2- and FOXP3-dependent manner. Moreover,
the doses used here do not interfere with protein translation and
cause no obvious side effect, yet the drug causes dramatic
inhibition of growth of established mammary tumors in syngeneic
hosts. Although more work is needed to evaluate the potential for
anisomycin for breast cancer treatment, our data suggest that one
may be able to reactivate X-linked tumor suppressor genes for
cancer treatment.

Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest
No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.
Figure 6. Anisomycin conferred significant therapeutic effect for established
mammary tumor in mice. TSA cells (5  105) were injected into mammary fat
pads of syngeneic BALb/c mice. After 17 d of injection, the mice with palpable
tumors were randomly grouped and treated with anisomycin or vehicle control
i.p., every 2 d for 8 times, at a dose of 0.5 mg per mouse. The dose used did not
give obvious side effects and was f1/20 of LD50 in the mice. The tumor
diameters were derived from the average of largest diameters in two dimensions.
The tumor volumes defined as 0.75kr3, where r is radius. A, the growth kinetics
is shown; B, photographs of tumors before, and at the end of treatments were
shown at the bottom. Similar therapeutic effects have been observed in three
independent experiments.
