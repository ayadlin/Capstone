ABSTRACT
Pepper, a daily-used seasoning for promoting appetite, is widely used in folk
medicine for treating gastrointestinal diseases. Piperine is the major alkaloid in pepper
and possesses a wide range of pharmacological activities. However, the mechanism
for linking metabolic and medicinal activities of piperine remains unknown. Here
we report that piperine robustly boosts mTORC1 activity by recruiting more system
L1 amino acid transporter (SLC7A5/SLC3A2) to the cell membrane, thus promoting
amino acid metabolism. Piperine-induced increase of mTORC1 activity in resident
peritoneal macrophages (pMΦs) is correlated with enhanced production of IL-6 and
TNF-α upon LPS stimulation. Such an enhancement of cytokine production could be
abrogated by inhibitors of the mTOR signaling pathway, indicating mTOR’s action in
this process. Moreover, piperine treatment protected resident pMΦs from bacteriuminduced apoptosis and disappearance, and increased their bacterial phagocytic
ability. Consequently, piperine administration conferred mice resistance against
bacterial infection and even sepsis. Our data highlight that piperine has the capacity
to metabolically reprogram peritoneal resident macrophages to fortify their innate
functions against bacterial infection.

INTRODUCTION

countries, pepper is broadly used as a medicinal herb for
treating gastrointestinal diseases [7], in which piperine
might act as the major active component. Therefore,
piperine appears to be a potential immunomodulator for
therapeutic usage against inflammatory diseases as well
as bacterial infection. However, the relationship between
the metabolic and pharmacologic effects of piperine is
unclear; particularly, the underlying action mechanism
of piperine in the setting of bacterial infection is largely
unknown.
Considering that pepper acts as a seasoning in
improving digestion and appetite, we have tried to test
influences of its major component piperine on a variety

Pepper has long been used as a food seasoning
and an ingredient in folk medicine. Modern medicinal
chemistry has revealed that piperine is the major plant
alkaloid in pepper. This alkaloid possesses a broad
spectrum of pharmacological activities, including antidepression and anti-epilepsy effects [1, 2], as well as
abilities to reduce lipid deposition and body weight
[3]. It is also effective for a variety of experimental
inflammatory diseases, including gastric ulcer [4],
arthritis [5], and endotoxin-induced shock [6]. In Asian

of signaling pathways of cellular metabolism. One of
these pathways is the mTOR signaling. mTOR is a highly
conservative molecule in eukaryotic evolution, which
is necessary for maintaining metabolic homeostasis,
cell proliferation, survival, and promoting protein
synthesis [8, 9]. By binding with other proteins, mTOR
forms two different large complexes, mTOR complex 1
(mTORC1) and mTORC2, which show different serine/
threonine kinase activities on their respective substrates.
mTORC1 phosphorylates 4E-BP1 and p70S6K, while
mTORC2 phosphorylates AKT at Ser473 [10]. In
recent years, increasing studies have focused on the
immunoregulatory function of mTOR signaling. For
example, mTOR inhibitors have been reported to regulate
immune responses, mainly serving as immunosuppressive
agents [11, 12]. On the other hand, emerging evidence
demonstrates that uptake of amino acids and hence
activation of mTOR are required for gastrointestinal
homeostasis against invasion of commensal microbes [13],
suggesting mTOR’s action on promoting innate immunity
of the gut.
Peritoneal macrophages (pMΦs) are one type of
tissue-resident macrophages that have been extensively
explored, but their tissue-specific function has been
poorly understood. One recent finding reveals that resident
pMΦs are pivotal innate immune cells in maintaining
gastrointestinal homeostasis [14]. At homeostasis, resident
pMΦs are mainly composed of two populations: the large
peritoneal macrophages (LPMs) with an F4/80hiMHCIIlow
phenotype predominate the peritoneal cavity, while
the small peritoneal macrophages (SPMs) with an
F4/80lowMHCIIhi phenotype are the minor population.
Although the developmental status of SPMs is largely
unknown, the LPMs have been characterized as fetaloriginated tissue-resident macrophages expressing a
distinctive transcription factor GATA6 [15, 16], and
regulating the function of peritoneal B-1 cells [14].
Thus, resident pMΦs under the steady-state conditions
constitute a differing population from monocyte-derived
macrophages (MDMs) of the peritoneal cavity in the
inflammatory settings.
Although piperine has been shown to suppress
innate immune responses in inflammatory MDMs from
the peritoneal cavity [6], it is still unknown whether
piperine has similar effects on resident pMΦs and whether
its administration exacerbates or prevents peritoneal
bacterial infection. In this study, we found that piperine
potentiated the mTORC1 activity by recruiting system
L1 amino acid transporter SLC7A5/SLC3A2 [17] to the
cell membrane and promoting amino acid metabolism.
Enhancement of the mTORC1 activity by piperine
was correlated with reinforced functions of resident
pMΦs upon bacterial stimulation, which conferred mice
resistance against peritoneal bacterial infection and sepsis.
Our data highlight piperine as a pharmacological booster
of the mTORC1 activity during amino acid metabolism

to enhance the innate functions of resident pMΦs against
microbial infection.

RESULTS
Piperine enhances the mTORC1
depending on amino acid metabolism

activity

The activity of piperine on the mTOR pathway was
initially tested in cultured cell lines, and we discovered that
piperine elevated the mTORC1 activity in human LNCaP
and HeLa cells and mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells.
Piperine treatment enhanced the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and p70S6K, two substrates of the mTORC1 kinase,
indicating that this alkaloid could enhance the mTORC1
signaling in these cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1, A,
B and C).
We next determined the action mechanism by
which piperine enhanced the mTORC1 activity. mTOR
is a central player in sensing nutrient sufficiency and
regulating diverse metabolic processes [18]. It can be
activated by hormones (e.g. insulin), nutrients, and
cytokines [19]. Piperine has been shown to enhance the
permeability of intestinal epithelial cells [20], increase
the bioavailability of various drugs [21, 22] and promote
the uptake of amino acids [20]. These studies prompted
us to explore whether piperine enhanced the mTORC1
activity depending on nutrients in culture medium. To
this end, HeLa cells were first starved in Earle’s Balanced
Salt Solution (EBSS) medium (without serum and amino
acids) to suppress the basal mTORC1 activity, and then
cultured in different media lacking serum, amino acids or
glucose, respectively. The mTORC1 failed to be activated
by EBSS medium, either with or without glucose. In
contrast, the mTORC1 activity was elevated by serumfree DMEM, and was further potentiated by piperine cotreatment (Figure 1A and 1B).
Considering that DMEM contains amino acids but
EBSS does not, these results suggested that piperineinduced elevation of the mTORC1 activity may rely
on the presence of amino acids, instead of glucose. It is
known that mTORC1 is activated during glutaminolysis,
in which L-glutamine (Gln) is sequentially metabolized
into L-glutamate and α-keroglutarate by glutaminase
and glutamate dehydrogenase, respectively [23]. As
an allosteric activator of glutamate dehydrogenase,
L-leucine (Leu) promotes the conversion of L-glutamate
to α-keroglutarate, which is a robust inducer of mTORC1
activation [24]. However, Gln is the rate-limiting amino
acid for the mTORC1 activation by this way, since the
efflux of intracellular Gln is required for the uptake of
Leu and other essential amino acids via the bidirectional
SLC7A5/SLC3A2 transporter [25]. Consistent with these
studies, the mTORC1 activity was activated in HeLa

cells in the presence of Leu, or Leu plus Gln, but not Gln
alone, and combination of these amino acids with piperine
further increased the mTORC1 activity (Figure 1C and 1D
and Supplementary Figure S2A). Notably, after the cells
were starved for a short period (50 min), which is likely
insufficient to exhaust the intracellular Gln pool [23],
piperine potentiated the mTORC1 activation induced by
Leu treatment alone at 30 min (Figure 1C and 1D), but
not at 2 h (Supplementary Figure S2A). Moreover, when
Gln was preloaded into the cells having starved for 3 h,
piperine markedly intensified Leu-induced mTORC1
activation at time point of 30 min (Figure 1E and 1F), and
also enhanced it at earlier (Supplementary Figure S2B)
or later time points (Figure 1E and 1F). Collectively,
piperine-induced elevation of the mTORC1 activity

relies on the uptake of specific (or essential) amino acids
including Leu in the presence of intracellular Gln.

Piperine enhances mTORC1 activity by recruiting
amino acid transporters to the cell surface
SLC7A5/SLC3A2 heterodimer is also known as
system L1 amino acid transporter, the major cell surface
transporter for Leu [17]. This is a bidirectional transporter
as the export of Gln is required for the import of Leu
[25], which can critically activates the mTORC1 activity
[18, 25]. We explored whether the effect of piperine on
mTORC1 activation was contributed by this bidirectional
transporter. Consistent with previous reports [25], our

result showed that knockdown of SCL7A5 with siRNA
also downregulated the expression of SLC3A2 (Figure
2A and 2B). As expected, the effect of piperine on
enhancing Leu-induced mTORC1 activation (as revealed
by p70S6K phosphorylation) was greatly suppressed

by SLC7A5 knockdown (Figure 2A and 2B). Likewise,
immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that
Leu induced the co-localization of mTOR and lysosome
marker LAMP2, indicating the activation of mTOR
on the lysosomal membrane. Once again, piperine

Piperine treatment activates mTORC1 signaling
in resident pMΦs

treatment enhanced Leu-induced mTOR activation by
promoting the translocation of mTOR onto the lysosome.
However, when Leu transporter was blocked by 2-amino2-norbornanecarboxylic acid (BCH), an inhibitor of
SLC7A5 [25, 26], the co-localization of mTOR and
LAMP2 was abrogated (Figure 2C). These results
suggested that piperine enhanced Leu-induced mTORC1
activation through the system L1 amino acid transporter
SLC7A5/SLC3A2. To further verify this hypothesis,
the subcellular distribution of SLC7A5/SLC3A2 was
observed by immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of
the SLC3A2 subunit. The results showed that SLC3A2
was distributed at both cell membrane and intracellular
compartments in vehicle-treated cells. After piperine
treatment, regardless of the presence or absence of Leu,
more SLC3A2 was distributed at the cell membrane,
with increased mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) in this
cellular compartment. However, the difference on cellmembranous MFI between vehicle and Leu groups was
not statistically significant (Figure 2D and 2E). Thus,
piperine appeared to poise cells to transport amino acids
more efficiently by recruiting intracellular SLC7A5/
SLC3A2 onto the cell membrane.

To confirm whether piperine potentiates mTORC1
activity in primary macrophages, we treated freshly
isolated mouse resident pMΦs with piperine and measured
the phosphorylation levels of p70S6K by Western blotting.
Piperine significantly increased the phosphorylation levels
of p70S6K, which could be attenuated by LY294002, an
inhibitor of PI3K upstream of mTORC1 [27] (Figure 3A
and 3B). Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy
revealed that piperine time-dependently elevated the
phosphorylation of S6 protein, a substrate of p70S6K,
in CD11b+ resident pMΦs (Figure 3C and 3D). When
resident pMΦs were preloaded with Gln after amino acid
starvation for 3 h, piperine greatly enhanced mTORC1
activation in the presence of Leu (Figure 3E and 3F).
Thus, piperine elevated the mTORC1 activity both in
RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line and in primary resident
pMΦs.

Piperine treatment increases LPS-stimulated IL-6
and TNF-α expression in resident pMΦs, but not
in thioglycollate (TG)-elicited ones

were used for experiments, piperine pretreatment did not
change IL-6 and TNF-α expression upon LPS stimulation
(Supplementary Figure S3A), but even suppressed the
expression of interferon-γ (Supplementary Figure S3B),
in step with a previous study [6]. As aforementioned,
pMΦs may be classified into two populations based
on their expression of macrophage markers F4/80 and
MHC class II (MHCII) molecules [14]. The differential
responses of cytokine expression in resident pMΦs and
TG-elicited ones is likely because they are different types
of macrophages, with the latter being mostly MDMs as a
result of TG stimulation.
To confirm this, we analyzed the phenotypes of
these two macrophage populations by flow cytometry.
TG treatment suppressed the expression of F4/80 in
the pMΦs, while the resident pMΦs in control group
contained more LPMs but fewer SPMs as compared to
TG-elicited cells (Supplementary Figure S4A). Moreover,
GATA6, a transcription factor critical for resident pMΦ
function and survival [16], was highly expressed in
resident pMΦs, but only in a minor subset of TG-elicited
cells (Supplementary Figure S4A and S4B). In addition,
TG-elicited pMΦs were, on average, larger in size than
the resident ones (Supplementary Figure S4B). Therefore,
the resident and TG-elicited pMΦs were composed of
different cell populations, thus representing different types
of macrophages, which may probably account for their

Although piperine has exhibited anti-inflammatory
activity in different models [4-6], its effect on cytokine
expression in resident pMΦs has not yet been evaluated.
As enhanced mTOR activity can promote global protein
synthesis [8-10] and increase IL-6 and TNF-α secretion in
β-glucan-trained macrophages [28], we sought to explore
whether piperine, which acted as a booster of mTORC1
activation, elevated the expression of these cytokines in
resident pMΦs. Indeed, piperine pretreatment for either
short periods (1 h and 6 h) or a prolonged period (48 h)
markedly enhanced IL-6 and TNF-α production from
resident pMΦs stimulated with LPS, while piperine alone
had minimal effect (Figure 4A, 4B and 4C). Moreover,
in response to LPS stimulation in vitro, resident pMΦs
isolated from C57BL/6 mice which had intragastrically
(i.g.) administered with piperine for 10 days produced
more than two-fold amounts of IL-6 and TNF-α as much
as that of their counterparts from vehicle-treated mice. But
without LPS stimulation, the expression of these cytokines
was low in the pMΦs isolated from both piperineconditioned and control mice (Figure 4D).
However, when thioglycollate (TG)-elicited pMΦs

mTOR activation during piperine treatment. Both indirect
mTORC1 inhibitors LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) [27]
and MK-2206 (AKT inhibitor) [29], and direct inhibitor
rapamycin [30], completely abrogated the enhancement of
IL-6 and TNF-α expression in the presence of piperine.
However, they had minimal effect on LPS-induced
cytokine expression except MK-2206’s effect on IL-6
expression (Figure 5A, 5B and 5C). These results
indicated that piperine increased IL-6 and TNF-α protein
expression by enhancing the mTOR signaling.

Piperine-induced enhancement of cytokine
production is abrogated by PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway inhibitors
As the above data indicated that piperine elevated
the mTORC1 activity concomitant with enhanced
cytokine expression in resident pMΦs, we next explored
the causality between these two processes by blocking

Piperine administration provides protection
against bacterial infection and sepsis

having administered with piperine conferred resistance
to bacterial infection and septic shock. To verify this,
C57BL/6 mice were infected with lethal or sub-lethal
doses of viable Escherichia coli, and piperine was
administered before (prophylactic model) or after
(therapeutic model) bacterial inoculation. The results
showed that piperine treatment significantly protected
mice against lethal bacterial infection either in the
prophylactic (Figure 6A) or therapeutic model (Figure

As IL-6 and TNF-α are critical for pathogen
clearance by enhancing the functions of phagocytes [31,

peptides [33], we next further assessed whether enhanced

6B). For the prophylactic model, the control mice that
were infected with a lethal dose of viable E. coli (2×109
CFU/mouse) into their peritoneal cavity died within 24 h,
but those having administered with piperine had higher
survival rates after bacterial infection. Among the mice
having treated with 20 mg/kg but not 10 mg/kg piperine,
60% survived the first 24 h after bacterial challenge and
50% were still alive in an active state after 96 h (P <
0.05; Figure 6A). In the therapeutic model, piperine (20
mg/kg) treatment 1 h after bacterial infection with a sublethal dose of E. coli (1×109 CFU/mouse) also reduced
the mouse mortality (P < 0.05; Figure 6B). Histochemical
analysis demonstrated that viable bacterial infection in the
peritoneal cavity had induced sepsis, but the symptoms of
sepsis were alleviated by piperine treatment, with fewer
infiltrated leukocytes in the liver tissue sections and no

obvious inflammation in the colon (Figure 6C and 6D).
As expected, bacterial infection greatly increased
the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in their peritoneal
cavity, whereas such cytokine levels were lower or
undetectable without bacterial infection. Interestingly,
compared with controls, piperine-administered mice had
significant higher IL-6 and TNF-α levels in their peritoneal
cavity lavage fluids at 6 h but had lowered levels of these
cytokines at 24 h (Figure 6E) after bacterial infection,
accompanied with a declined bacterial burden at 24 h
(Figure 6F). Therefore, piperine administration to mice
appeared to enhance the innate functions of their pMΦs,
thereby accelerating bacterial clearance and inflammation
resolution in their peritoneal cavity.

Piperine protects resident pMΦs from bacteriuminduced apoptosis

To quantitatively evaluate cell apoptosis, mice were
infected with viable E. coli and their pMΦs were analyzed
after intracellular cleaved caspase-3 staining. Caspase-3 is
a critical executive protease in apoptosis process [37]. As
shown in Figure 8B and 8C, bacterial infection increased
cleaved caspase-3 levels in macrophages, suggesting that
apoptosis was initiated early (0.5 h post infection) after
phagocytosis of bacteria. Piperine treatment reduced
the cleaved caspase-3 levels in both CD11b+ and F4/80+
pMΦs, but this effect of piperine could be blocked by
metformin treatment. Together, these results suggested
that piperine treatment (thus enhancing the mTOR
activity) protected resident pMΦs from bacterium-induced
apoptotic cell death.

The lowered bacterial burden in piperineadministered mice prompted us to explore whether
piperine treatment had enhanced the bacterial phagocytic
ability of their resident pMΦs. For this purpose, mice were
injected with CFSE-labeled bacteria and their resident
pMΦs were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results
showed that most F4/80hi cells also had highest CFSE
intensity (Figure 7A), suggesting that the F4/80hi resident
pMΦs were the major bacterial phagocytic cells at the
early stage of infection, which is in step with previous
reports [34]. It was noticeable that the ratio of F4/80hi
resident pMΦs in piperine-administered group was higher
than that of control (vehicle group) (Figure 7), suggesting
that piperine treatment protected the F4/80hi resident pMΦs
from bacterium-induced disappearance, a phenomenon
having been observed in peritonitis decades ago [35].
However, co-treatment with metformin, an activator of
AMPK and indirect inhibitor of mTOR signaling [28],
greatly attenuated such an effect of piperine, reducing both
the ratios of F4/80hi and F4/80hiCFSE+ pMΦs (Figure 7).
These data indicated that fewer pMΦs could be
isolated from the peritoneal cavity of mice infected with
bacteria as compared with control mice. Indeed, the F4/80hi
cells in normal mice accounted for about 80% of the total
pMΦs (Supplementary Figure 4A), but after infection this
ratio could be reduced below 30% (Figure 7). It appeared
that bacterial infection had quickly (within 0.5 h) led to
resident pMΦ disappearing. However, piperine treatment
seemed to attenuate the disappearance of F4/80hi pMΦs
by bacterial infection (Figure 7). Considering the effect
of piperine on mTOR activation and the role of mTOR in
cell survival [36], we explored whether piperine protected
F4/80hi resident pMΦs from cell death. To this end, mice
were infected with viable bacteria for 0.5 h and their
pMΦs were immediately isolated and seeded in glassbottom culture dishes, followed by CD11b and GATA6
antibody staining. It has been reported that GATA6
expression is a characteristic for resident pMΦs, which
is vital not only for their role in regulating peritoneal B-1
cells [14], but also for their own renewal and survival [15,
16]. As shown in Figure 8A, many bacterium-containing
vacuoles could be observed in CD11bhi/GATA6bright pMΦs,
but not in CD11blow/GATA6faint cells. In addition, overphagocytosis of viable bacteria might have led to apoptosis
(as judged by karyorrhexis) of the former cells, instead of
the latter ones, and GATA6 was diffusely distributed in the
apoptotic cells. Piperine pre-administration prevented the
CD11bhi/GATA6bright pMΦs from apoptosis, and confined
GATA6 within their nuclei. Of note, few CD11bhi/
GATA6bright pMΦs could be observed in either the vehicle
or piperine+metformin group, possibly because this cell
population had died from infection and thus detached from
dishes.

DISCUSSION
Peritoneal bacterial infection or even bacterial
sepsis, due to the penetration of intestinal bacteria,
constitutes a great challenge in the treatment of bowel
diseases. Here we reported that piperine enhanced the
mTORC1 activity by recruiting amino acid transporter to
the cell membrane and promoting amino acid metabolism
(e.g., glutaminolysis). Such an activity of piperine was
linked to its anti-bacterial action at least in resident pMΦs
of mice. The prophylactic and therapeutic model study
demonstrated that piperine were effective for preventing
bacterial infection and even for sepsis. To our knowledge,
we for the first time reported that a small molecule alkaloid
has the capacity to enhance mTORC1 activity and thus
fortifies the functions of resident pMΦs.
It has long been established that piperine increases
bioavailability of clinical drugs [21, 22], accelerating
uptake of amino acids (including Leu) and other nutrients
by intestinal epithelial cells [20]. But the mechanism
underlying this process is unclear. It was unlikely that
Leu could pass through the cell membrane in a nonspecific manner, since it is a large neutral (aliphatic)
amino acid relying on distinct transporters for its uptake
into cells. Our study provided evidence showing that
piperine promoted amino acid metabolism by recruiting
more SLC7A5/SLC3A2, the system L1 amino acid
transporter for Leu and other large neutral ones, to
the cell membrane, which in turn enhanced mTORC1
activation [18, 25]. Previous reports have indicated
that mTOR is a central player in sensing nutrient
sufficiency and regulating diverse metabolic processes
[18]. Uptake of amino acids, such as Leu and Gln,
leads to mTORC1 activation on the lysosomal surface,
in a Rag small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases)dependent or independent manner [23, 38, 39]. Amino
acid metabolism and mTORC1 activation may rely on the
cell membrane abundance of the transporter, instead of
its total cellular protein levels. Supporting this, although
the total SLC7A5/SLC3A2 protein levels were greatly
suppressed by SLC7A5 knockdown, the mTORC1

activity in SLC7A5-knocked down cells co-treated with
piperine and Leu was still higher than that in control cells
treated with Leu alone (Figure 2A and 2B). The uptake
of Leu by SLC7A5 has been reported to be required for
the metabolic reprograming (mTOR activation) essential
for T cell differentiation in response to antigens [40]. At
certain circumstances, such as hepatitis B virus infection
[41], T cells may upregulate SLC7A5 expression to meet
the requirement for Leu and metabolic reprograming.
Thus, likely acting through a similar mechanism, piperine
pharmacologically potentiates mTORC1 activation by

reprogramming amino acid metabolism.
Our study demonstrated that increased mTORC1
activation by piperine enhanced the functions of resident
pMΦs, including their bacterial phagocytic ability and
LPS-induced cytokine-producing capacity. Consistent
with the role of mTOR signaling in cell survival [36],
our results also demonstrated that piperine administration
prevented F4/80hi resident pMΦs from apoptosis. Due to
such functional enhancements of resident pMΦs, piperine
enhanced bacterial clearance and protected mice against
bacterial infection in the peritoneal cavity. Therefore,

the mTORC1-upregulatory capacity of piperine is of
clinical significance: it may provide protection against
infection for humans in a state of sub-malnutrition (in
which the mTORC1 activity is below normal levels),
such as in the case of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
[13, 42]. In support of this hypothesis, uptake of amino
acids and hence activation of mTOR are required for
the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis [13], whereas
malnutrition or suppression of mTOR activity induces
colitis due to dysregulated innate immune functions of the
intestine [43].
In recent years, many studies focused on the
immunoregulatory action of mTOR signaling in
macrophages [44, 45]. It has been reported that the fungal
cell wall component β-glucan can prime monocytes/
macrophages to mount an enhanced innate response
against fungal infection by activating the mTOR pathway.
One characteristic of β-glucan-primed monocytes is
their enhanced ability to secrete IL-6 and TNF-α upon
pathogen stimulation [28]; the authors named such
immunological memory traits of innate immune cells as
“trained immunity”. Consistent with this finding, our data
demonstrated that enhanced mTORC1 activity in piperinepretreated cells was linked to increased IL-6 and TNF-α
expression and enhanced phagocytic capacity of resident
pMΦs, as blocking the mTOR pathway by specific
inhibitors attenuated all these effects of piperine. These
results suggest that piperine and β-glucan may act through
certain common mechanisms for enhancing the innate
functions of monocytes/macrophages to prevent pathogen
infection, but further investigation is required to clarify
this issue.
It has been known that IL-6 and TNF-α secretion
by macrophages upon bacterial infection in turn enhances
their phagocytic capacity, thus promoting the clearance
of pathogens [31, 46, 47]. Indeed, increased IL-6 and
TNF-α production was correlated with enhanced bacterial
clearance in piperine-administered mice compared
to control mice (Figure 6F). Immunofluorescence
observation demonstrated that it was the LPMs
(CD11bbrightGATA6bright), instead of SPMs, robustly
engulfed bacteria (Figure 8A). These results demonstrated
that the resident pMΦs were the major bacterial phagocytic
cells at least at the early stage of infection and that their
phagocytic capacity was enhanced by piperine treatment.
In light of the notion that IL-6 and TNF-α promote wound
healing and tissue repair [48-50], increased production of
these cytokines may also limit pathogens from penetrating
the epithelial lining of the intestine and invading into the
peritoneal cavity to induce sepsis, an extreme case of IBD
[51].
In summary, we demonstrated that piperine
promoted amino acid metabolism and thus enhanced the
mTORC1 activation in peritoneal resident macrophages,
resulting in potentiation of their innate functions against
bacterial infection, alleviating bacterial septic shock. Our
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

study highlights the value of piperine not only as a major
ingredient in daily seasoning for promoting appetite and
digestion, but also as an mTORC1 booster to enhance the
innate immunity of tissue-resident macrophages in fighting
against diverse pathogens in certain clinical settings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Female C57BL/6 mice were bought from the
Experimental Animal Center of Southern Medical
University (Guangzhou, China). Animal experiments
were designed following National Institutes of Health
guidelines and were approved by the Committee on the
Ethics of Animal Experiments of Jinan University.

Bacterial preparation
E. coli strain DH5α were grown in Luria Broth
(LB) media and shaken overnight at 37 °C, and then reinoculated into fresh LB at 10% for 3 h at 37 °C. Bacteria
cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1824 ×g for 10
min, washed with 10 ml PBS twice, and resuspended in
appropriate volume of PBS. Cell density was determined
using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Nanodrop
2000; Thermo Scientific) and the corresponding colonyforming units (CFU) were determined on LB agar plates.
For some experiments, viable E. coli cells were stained
with 40 μM carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl
ester (CFSE), washed and then inactivated for 1 h at 70
°C in water bath.

according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Mice were acclimated for one week. Viable E. coli
DH5α resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS was injected into
the peritoneal cavity (i.p.), and the lethal (2×109 CFU)
and sub-lethal doses (1×109 CFU) were determined by
preliminary experiments, which induced peritonitis or
even severe sepsis. Piperine (dissolved in 2% Tween-80
in PBS as a suspension) or vehicle (2% Tween-80 in PBS)
was given intragastrically (i.g.) before or after bacterial
infection. In the former model, mice were administered
with piperine at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg once a day for 3
d consecutively prior to bacterial infection (2×109 CFU); in
the latter model, mice were infected with bacteria (1×109
CFU) and 1 h later were given with 20 mg/kg piperine
for only once. Mouse survival was monitored every 6 h
for 4 d. In another experiment, the bacterial burden in
the peritoneal cavity of mice was determined. The mice
were sacrificed and peritoneal lavage fluids were collected
with 1.5 ml PBS. Serial dilutions were made of the lavage
fluids and then incubated overnight at 37 °C on LB agar
plates; CFUs of bacteria were counted and calculated.

Western blotting
HeLa, LNCaP, and RAW 264.7 cells were seeded
in plastic flasks and cultured for 24 h and then changed
with new culture medium with indicated doses of piperine.
Whole cell lysates and Western blotting were performed as
previously described [11].

Immunofluorescence microscopy
Immunofluorescent staining was performed
essentially as previously described [52]. Briefly, peritoneal
macrophages were cultured in glass-bottom dishes, fixed,
permeabilized and immunostained with rabbit anti-p-S6
antibody or anti-GATA6 antibody and AlexaFluor488CD11b, followed by CF568-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit
IgG (Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA). HeLa cells were
immunostained with rabbit anti-mTOR antibody and
mouse anti-LAMP2 antibody, or anti-SLC3A2 antibody
alone, followed by CF488A-conjugated goat-anti-mouse
IgG (Biotium) and/or CF568-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit
IgG. Nuclei were revealed by Hoechst 33342 staining.
Cells were observed using a Zeiss Axio Observer D1
microscope with a Zeiss EC Plan-Neofluar 100×/1.30
Oil M27 objective (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH,
Göttingen, Germany). Fluorescence images were captured
with a Zeiss AxioCam MR R3 cooled CCD camera
controlled with ZEN software (ZEISS).

Peritoneal macrophage isolation
For in vitro study, mice were sacrificed by cervical
dislocation and sterilized by 70% ethanol. Peritoneal
macrophages were immediately isolated by washing
the peritoneal cavity with washing buffer (sterile PBS
containing 5% newborn calf serum and 0.5 mM EDTA).
The extracted solution was centrifuged at 300 ×g for 10
min and isolated cells were cultured at 37 °C in DMEM
plus 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml
streptomycin (complete medium). After 2-h incubation,
unattached cells were discarded and attached macrophages
were further cultured in fresh complete medium. In
some experiments, C57BL/6 mice were first injected
via i.p. with 1 ml of 3% thioglycollate (TG). Peritoneal
macrophages were isolated 4 d post the injection.

Histopathology
After mice were sacrificed, liver and small intestine
were harvested, fixed in 4% neutral formaldehyde, and
stained with haemotoxylin and eosin (H&E). Images were
captured under a microscope armed with a color CCD
(Zeiss Axio Observer D1).

Cell line culture

Knockdown of SLC7A5

Human cervical cancer HeLa cells, prostate cancer
LNCaP cells and mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7
was obtained from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were maintained in
complete DMEM medium and were cultured at 37 ºC in a
humidified incubator with 5% CO2.

HeLa were seeded in 6-well plates (Corning) (for
Western blotting) or glass bottom culture dishes (NEST,
China) (for immunofluorescent staining) for 24 h. SLC7A5
siRNAs and negative control were produced by Ribobio
(Guangzhou, China). The SLC7A5-specific siRNA
sequence is 5’-GCAUCGGCUUCACCAUCAUdTdT-3’
targeting
5’-GCATCGGCTTCACCATCAT-3’.
Knockdown of SLC7A5 was performed using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the
instructions provided by the manufacturer. The siRNA was
added to each well at a final siRNA concentration of 100
nM. Six hours later, cells were cultured in normal medium
