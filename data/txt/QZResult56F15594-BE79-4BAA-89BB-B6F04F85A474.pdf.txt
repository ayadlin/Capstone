ABSTRACT
Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) consists of a heterogeneous group
of tumors with a high rate of metastasis and mortality. To facilitate the in-depth
investigation and validation of tailored strategies for MIBC treatment, we have
developed an integrated approach using advanced high-throughput drug screening
and a clinically relevant patient-derived preclinical platform. We isolated patientderived tumor cells (PDCs) from a rare MIBC case (BD-138T) that harbors concomitant
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification and phosphatase and tensin
homolog (PTEN) deletion. High-throughput in vitro drug screening demonstrated
that dasatinib, a SRC inhibitor, and PKI-587, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, exhibited
targeted anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects against BD-138T PDCs. Using
established patient-derived xenograft models that successfully retain the genomic and
molecular characteristics of the parental tumor, we confirmed that these anti-tumor
responses occurred through the inhibition of SRC and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
pathways. Taken together, these experimental results demonstrate that dasatinib
and PKI-587 might serve as promising anticancer drug candidates for treating MIBC
with combined EGFR gene amplification and PTEN deletion.

INTRODUCTION

[2, 3]. As no truly effective systemic therapies are
available for MIBC, there remains a pressing need for
novel therapies to improve survival. Notably, NMIBC and
MIBC are associated with distinct genotypic and molecular
patterns [4, 5]. Previous integrated studies of 131 patients
with MIBC identified several key alterations in factors
involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, CDKN2A/CDK4/
CCND1, and RTK/RAS pathways including ERBB2,
ERBB3, and FGFR3 [6]. Another recent report analyzing

Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) correlates

candidates using in vitro high-throughput drug screening
(HTS) on patient-derived tumor cells (PDCs) and validated
the in-vivo efficacy of the identified target molecules
in PDXs that recapitulated the genetic, molecular, and
histopathological characteristics of the parental tumor.

a series of 35 relapsed bladder cases also found that 83%
of the cases had at least one actionable genomic alteration
amenable to the application of targeted therapy [7].
Such rational targeting of activating mutations has
the potential to enhance the cure rate of MIBC when
used in combination with or instead of conventional
cytotoxic chemotherapy. With the goal of accelerating
the adoption of a precision medicine-based approach for
patients with MIBC, molecular stratification of MIBC
based on validated predictive biomarkers might identify
clinically relevant patient subgroups and help to provide
effective targeted therapies. However, the development
of successful molecular based therapies in MIBC
remains challenging because of the substantial genomic
heterogeneity of high-grade MIBCs [8, 9]. In particular,
the low response rate is in part attributed to the fact that
most cancers harbor multiple genetic aberrations [10, 11].
Such pathway alterations were found to be independently
distributed, suggesting that the mutation of two pathway
members might have synergistic or additive effects
through non-canonical functions.
The analysis of tumor biology by molecular
manipulation, identification of relevant predictive
biomarkers, and preclinical testing of novel therapeutic
agents critically depends on conclusive in vivo models
of human cancer. However, the correlation of drug
sensitivity between conventional cell lines and clinical
trials is, in general, poor [12]. These limitations have been
resolved by patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) in which
specific genetic, molecular and biological characteristics
of the original tumor are reliably retained. For example,
the establishment of bladder cancer PDXs by grafting
representative cancer tissue into the subcutaneous
compartment [13, 14] or under the renal capsule of
immune-deficient mice [15] has previously been reported.
Herein, we identified an unprecedented locally
advanced MIBC case that harbored both epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) amplification and phosphatase and
tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion. To identify an optimal
therapeutic option for this patient, we ascertained drug

RESULTS
Characterization of EGFR-amplified and PTENdeleted MIBC PDCs (BD-138T)
BD-138T cells were obtained from a male patient,
aged 56 years, previously diagnosed with high-grade
transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) in the urinary bladder
(Figure 1A). Cystoscopy and transurethral resection of the
tumor was conducted; however, residual tumor remained.
Pathological examination confirmed a grade 3 urothelial
carcinoma with evidence of invasion into the muscular
layer (T2G3). As preoperative imaging modalities did
not identify any signs of distant metastasis, neoadjuvant
chemotherapy was not administered. He received
radical cystectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy
(gemcitabine and paclitaxel). Through final pathological
examination, the tumor was staged as a pT3bN1. No signs
of local relapse or distant metastasis were detected until
the 23 month postoperative follow-up.
Prior to the analysis, we demonstrated the urothelial
origin of the tumor cells through hematoxylin-eosin
(H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC)
analysis for cytokeratin (CK) 7, pan-CK, Ki-67, CK20,
and desmin (Figure 1B) [16, 17]. Next, we analyzed
single nucleotide variations, copy number variation, and
translocation using genomic DNA via array comparative
genomic hybridization (aCGH) and the CancerSCAN™
system [18] to identify cancer-driving pathways that might
be therapeutically targeted in BD-138T MIBC. Notably,
this strategy revealed high-level EGFR gene (7p11.2)
amplification and bi-allelic PTEN gene (10q23.31) deletion
in BD-138T patient samples (Figure 2A and 2B). Strong

expression was confirmed by IHC analysis (Figure 2C).
In the genomic analysis of 413 bladder cancers with
genomic sequence data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) (http://www.cbioportal.org), we identified
discrete EGFR amplification (5%) and PTEN deletion
(5%); however, cases harboring both EGFR and PTEN
alteration as observed in the current MIBC case were
extremely rare, suggesting that these two alterations are
mutually exclusive.

were of urothelial cell origin and that neither fibroblast
nor smooth muscle cells were present. The presence of
EGFR amplification and PTEN deletion was confirmed in
the PDCs by genomic profiling (data not shown). These
results demonstrated that BD-138T retained the urothelial
features and a genomic/molecular phenotype similar to
those of the primary tumor.
After cytological confirmation, we subsequently
screened the PDCs using a panel of anti-cancer agents
(Table 1) considered particularly capable of addressing
genomic alterations in bladder cancer. The BD-138T
PDCs showed ample responses to a dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor, PKI-587 (IC50 = 200 nM) and a SRC inhibitor,
dasatinib (IC50 = 430 nM) (Table 1 and Figure 4A)
whereas neither the agents targeting EGFR (erlotinib,
gefitinib, lapatinib, and BIBW2992) nor those targeting
mTOR (temsirolimus and everolimus) exhibited such
effects (Table 1). In addition, BD-138T parental tumor
tissues showed significantly activated SRC and AKT,
suggesting these pathways as druggable targets specific to

concomitantly EGFR-amplified and PTEN-deleted MIBCs
(Figure 4B). BD-138T cells showed profoundly decreased
mitotic fractions and an increased rate of apoptosis after
treatment with 0.5 and 1 μM dasatinib or 0.5 and 1 μM
PKI-587 (Figure 4C). Taken together, these in vitro data
suggest that the combination of EGFR gene amplification
and PTEN deletion in MIBC renders the cells sensitive
to treatment with dasatinib and PKI-587 owing to
upregulated SRC and AKT signaling pathways.

(Figure 6A). Single-agent treatment protocols were well
tolerated by the mice, with no weight loss or other signs
of acute or delayed toxicity (Figure 6B). As shown in
Figure 6C, PKI-587 alone suppressed the phosphorylation
of downstream effectors of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
(e.g., AKT at S473 and p70S6K at Thr389), whereas the
biomarkers Tyr416-phosphorylated SRC and Ser473phosphorylated AKT were observed in response to dasatinib
treatment. These findings linked treatment with either
dasatinib or PKI-587 to signiﬁcant reduction of the mitotic
fraction and signiﬁcant induction of the apoptotic fraction
(Figure 6D), consistent with the in vitro results. Together,
these results suggest that BD-138T cells are sensitive
to PKI-587 and dasatinib in xenograft tumors as well as
in vitro and that this susceptibility is mediated through a
blockade on proliferation and an increase in apoptosis.

In vivo antitumor activity of dasatinib and PKI-587
in BD-138T MIBC PDXs
To further verify our findings from in vitro studies
and test the efficacy of targeting SRC and the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR axis for MIBC therapy, we established
subcutaneous BD-138T PDXs (Figure 5A). Microscopic
examination through IHC analysis revealed the retention
of morphological characteristics and a close correlation
of the expression of various proteins between patient
tumors and their corresponding PDXs, confirming that the
tumor cells in the PDXs were indeed of human urothelial
cell origin (Figure 5B). Furthermore, both PDXs and
the original tumors exhibited conserved genomic DNA
alterations including both EGFR amplification and PTEN
deletion (Figure 5C–5E) as well as EGFR, p-EGFR,
PTEN, p-SRC, and p-AKT expression correlating
with that of the parental tumor (Figure 5F). Thus, the
BD-138T PDXs described reliably retained the specific
genetic, molecular, and histo-pathological features of the
original tumors, suggesting that our models are pertinent
to investigate potential molecular targets and to test the
efficacy of targeting agents.
As single agents, dasatinib (15 mg/kg) and PKI-587
(25 mg/kg) each showed strong anti-tumor activity in vivo
in these models, with PKI-587 showing superior inhibitory
effects on BD-138T tumor growth compared to dasatinib

DISCUSSION
A substantial number of relapsed and metastatic
MIBCs during the postcystectomy period are either
already resistant to the nontargeted systemic chemotherapy
at the time of initiation of systemic therapy or develop
resistance to chemotherapy over time [2, 3, 19, 20].
The patient prognosis after radical cystectomy in MIBC
depends on the extent of tumor invasion and whether
lymph node invasion is present [21]. For patient BD-138T,
whereas oncological follow-up was without indication of
local relapse or distant metastasis at the time of this report,
lymph node metastasis (N1) in the patient indicated that
additional treatment to prevent the metastasis of bladder
cancer to distant sites and to sensitize this patient to
chemotherapy might be subsequently required.
Our findings indicate that although MIBC is
genetically heterogeneous, therapies targeting specific
gene alterations might be effective if patients with
appropriate molecular profiles are identified prospectively.

The finding that the PDX model shares the same genetic

anti-tumor drug candidates for a MIBC case harboring
rare concomitant EGFR amplification and PTEN deletion,
we used an integrative approach based on histopathologic

amplification and PTEN deletion demonstrated that the
antitumor effects of dasatinib and PKI-587-based therapy
manifest through the inhibition of SRC and PI3K/mTOR/
AKT signaling.
Whereas EGFR mutations in urothelial carcinomas
appear to be rare events, in the TCGA study there was
a 9% incidence of EGFR ampliﬁcation in 131 MIBC
samples [6]. The level of EGFR expression directly
correlates with tumor grade, stage, and survival in human
bladder cancer [25–27], thus serving as a novel prognostic

PTEN-deficient tumors present an enhanced sensitivity
to mTOR inhibitors owing to sustained activation of the
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [24]. As BD-138T contains
both EGFR amplification and PTEN deletion, we originally
predicted that one or more of the EGFR inhibitors or
mTOR inhibitors might be effective agents against this
tumor. However, agents targeting EGFR or mTOR did
not elicit anti-tumor responses in the BD-138T PDCs.

marker to predict the chemo-responsiveness of patients
with locally recurrent or metastatic MIBC [28, 29].
Conversely, the clinical studies performed in patients
with recurrent and metastatic MIBC using anti-EGFR
treatments overall demonstrate a lack of efﬁcacy [30–32].
Consequently, the identification of genetic alterations
linked to primary response and the report of secondary
genetic events leading to acquired resistance to anti-EGFR
therapies still represent important diagnostic challenges.
The oncogenic activation of intracellular
signaling downstream of EGFR including the RAS/
RAF/MAPK, phospholipase C, PI3K/PTEN/AKT, and

signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
pathways [33] represents a critical mechanism for
resistance to EGFR inhibitors [34–36]. For example, as
PTEN negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT pathway, it is
easy to speculate that PTEN inactivation leads to EGFR
inhibitor resistance [37]. It is well demonstrated that the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is constitutively activated in
a large number of MIBCs, primarily because of loss of
heterozygosity or decreased expression of PTEN [38, 39],
which is correlated with poor survival in MIBCs [40].
Notably, PTEN-deficiency in bladder cancer cells yielded
disappointing results following rapamycin [41] or

everolimus [42] treatment compared to cells expressing
wild-type PTEN, likely because facilitation of AKT
activation upon PTEN loss can have a more important
role in driving the feedback loop in response to mTOR
inhibition than in promoting the mTOR pathway. A more
robust activity of novel dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors,
compared with either PI3K or mTOR inhibitors [43, 44],
is required for the efficient suppression of tumor growth
when multiple alterations of the PI3K pathway exist [45],
in particular in the absence of functional PTEN. PKI-587,
the most potent dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor advanced
to clinical development to date [46], suppresses the
phosphorylation of PI3K/mTOR effectors and induces
apoptosis in human cancer cell lines with elevated PI3K/
mTOR signaling [47].
Despite playing a central role in multiple
tumorigenic signaling networks of the SRC/FAK pathway
[48, 49], SRC itself is rarely mutated in cancers [49].

Instead, SRC can be activated by receptor tyrosine kinases
including EGFR, and SRC and EGFR act synergistically
through mutual phosphorylation and activation [50, 51].
Studies have indicated that EGFR mutations and possibly
other abnormalities of EGFR leading to enhanced SRC
expression are important determinants of tumor sensitivity
to SRC kinase inhibitors [52, 53]. Dasatinib is a novel
and multi-targeted kinase inhibitor that targets important
oncogenic pathways including SRC family kinases [53],
demonstrating significant preclinical activities in tumors
expressing active SRC-family kinase signaling [54, 55].
For example, the combination of a SRC inhibitor and an
EGFR inhibitor synergistically enhanced apoptosis in
EGFR-dependent lung cancer cells [56].
In summary, we demonstrated that inhibition of
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and SRC/FAK pathways utilizing
PKI-587 and dasatinib exhibits anti-tumor effects in MIBC
with concomitant EGFR amplification and PTEN deletion,

Agilent). Purified DNA was labeled with Cy5-dUTP
following the Agilent Oligonucleotide Array-Based CGH
for Genomic DNA Analysis protocol (Ver-7.3, Agilent).
Data were obtained using Agilent Feature Extraction
Software 9 and analyzed with Agilent CGH Analytics
Version 6.5 software, using the ADM-2 statistical
algorithms with 6.0 sensitivity thresholds. Based on the
aCGH data, the extracted signals were normalized to log2
ratios using the limma package [57]. We classified the
segmented results into copy losses when the log2 ratios
were lower than −0.25 and into copy gains when these
were greater than 0.25.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient sample collection
This study was carried out in accordance with
the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and was
approved by the Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea)
Institutional Review Board (IRB) (no. 2010-04-004). The
patient in this study provided written informed consent
for the research. Fresh tumor tissue was obtained from
bladder tumor tissue of the patient, diagnosed with MIBC
with single lymph node metastasis, by surgical excision
under sterile conditions. Surgical specimens were divided
into three portions for implantation into immune-deficient
BALB/c nude mice (Orient Bio, Seoul, Korea), DNA/
RNA extraction, and pathologic assessment. The case
was classified according to the 2016 WHO Classification
system. For the latter, serial 5-µm sections from each
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded block were processed
for H&E staining and examined by a specialized
pathologist.

EGFR FISH
EGFR gene copy number was determined by FISH
using the dual probe LSI EGFR Spectrum Orange/CEP7
Spectrum-Green Probe (Vysis; Abbott Laboratories,
Abbott Park, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and as previously described [34]. Normal
EGFR/CEP7 signals (one to two copies per cell) in the
various non-neoplastic cells served as the internal positive
control. We defined EGFR gene amplification as an EGFR/
CEP7 ratio > 2.0 in 20 tumor nuclei and polysomy-7 were
regarded as negative for gene amplification. Metaphase
analysis was performed on 20 consecutive spreads and
interphase analysis was performed on 100 consecutive
nuclei. Images were acquired using a cooled CCD camera
(SenSys, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA).

Technology (CST), Danvers, MA, USA), anti-pEGFRTyr1068 (CST), anti-PTEN (DAKO), anti-pSRC-Tyr416
(CST), and anti-pAKT-Ser473 (CST). After washing,
the slides were incubated with secondary antibodies for
1 h at room temperature (RT) and counterstained with
hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).

The Cancer Panel is a targeted next-generation
sequencing assay that was developed, validated, and
provided by the Samsung Genome Institute (Samsung
Medical Center, Seoul, Korea) [18]. It includes all exons
from 81 cancer-related genes and 31 introns from 5 genes
recurrently rearranged in cancer. Using the Illumina HiSeq
2500 instrument (San Diego, CA, USA), the captured
libraries underwent paired-end high-depth sequencing
(target > 800 × coverage). Data were analyzed using an
automated bioinformatics pipeline designed to detect
various genetic alterations including single nucleotide
variations, insertion and deletion, gene amplification and
deletion, and gene fusions [58].

aCGH

Primary in vitro short-term culture of PDCs

aCGH was performed using SurePrint G3 Human
CGH 4 × 180 K Microarrays (Agilent Technologies, Inc.,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). Labeling and hybridization were
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The dual-colored fluorescence signals were scanned using
the Agilent Microarray Scanner and translated to log10
ratios using Feature Extraction software (Ver-11.0.1.1,

PDC cultures were established through single cell
dissociation of tumor specimens according to previously
published protocols [59, 60]. Cell suspensions of the
patient tumor were acquired through tissue dissociation
utilizing a gentleMACs™ tissue dissociator (Miltenyi
Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and the resulting
suspensions were extruded through a 70-μm nylon filter.

Extracted cells were cultured in neurobasal media-A
supplemented with 10% FBS in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2 at 37°C. Authentication of these cells was
performed using short tandem repeat (STR) profiling.

(0.5 and 1.0 μM) were then applied separately on triplicate
samples. A day before sample fixation, cell culture
medium containing 5-ethynyl-2 ́-deoxyuridine (EdU,
10 μM) compound from the Click-iT EdU imaging Kits
(Molecular Probes) was added to the samples followed by
24 h incubation to allow EdU incorporation into the DNA
of cells undergoing active DNA synthesis (proliferation).
For counterstaining of the nuclei and detection of
casepase-3/7 and EdU, the cells were fixed using PFA
(4% w/v in PBS) for 20 min, permeabilized with Triton
×-100 (0.15% v/v in PBS) for 20 min, and blocked in BSA
(3% w/v in PBS) for 1 h at RT. Then, the Click-iT reaction
cocktails, prepared according to the manufacturer’s
recommendation, were applied to the samples and allowed
to react for 1 h at RT. After washing three times with
PBS, DNA staining was performed using Hoechst33342
(diluted in 3% BSA at the final concentration of 10 μg/mL)
for 30 min, also followed by three washes with PBS.
Fluorescent signals were automatically acquired with the
Operetta system and then the data were analyzed using
Harmony software (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).
The number of live cells in each well was determined
depending on the size, roundness, and intensity of DNA
and caspase-3/7 staining to discriminate intact nuclei
without showing nuclear condensation, fragmentation,
and caspase activation, respectively. The percentages of
caspase-3/7+ or EdU+ cells reflect the nuclei showing
fluorescence signals (Alexa Fluore488 for caspase-3/7 and
Alexa Fluor594 for EdU) greater than the threshold level
set by considering the background fluorescence level of
each channel.

Immunocytochemistry (ICC)
For ICC, tumor cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 20 min and blocked
with 5% donkey serum. Then, they were incubated with
primary antibodies including anti-human CK7, anti-human
Pan-CK, anti-human CK20, and anti-human Desmin
for 16 h at 4°C and then with anti-mouse Alexa 594
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) secondary antibodies for
2 h at RT with washing in between. Microscopy analysis
was performed using a confocal microscope (LSM700,
Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

In vitro HTS drug sensitivity assay
Primarily dissociated BD-138T MIBC cells were
seeded in 384-well plates at 500 cells per well. At 2 h after
plating, cells were treated with a drug library in 3-fold and
10-point serial dilution series (n = 3 for each condition).
The cells were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified
incubator for 6 days and cell viability was analyzed using
an ATP monitoring system based on firefly luciferase
(ATPlite 1 step; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The drug library
was composed of a variety of targeted and cytotoxic agents
(erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, BIBW2992, temsirolimus,
everolimus, PKI-587, BEZ-235, dasatinib, sorafenib,
AZD6244, imatinib, cabozantinib, BAY73-4506,
ABT-888, crizotinib, INCB28060, LY2835219, GDC0449, gembitabine, oxaliplatin, carboplatin, irinotecan,
etoposide, vinblastin, paclitaxel, and docetaxel; all
purchased from Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA).
The drugs were prepared and diluted according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. IC50 values were calculated
as an average of triplicate experiments using the S+ Chip
Analyzer (Samsung Electro-Mechanics Company, Ltd.,
Gyeonggi, Korea) [61].

In vivo efficacy studies in established MIBC
PDXs
Animal experiments were carried out in accordance
with the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and
following protocols approved by the IRB at the Samsung
Medical Center (No. 2014-11-19-003). Briefly, Matrigel
(BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA)-embedded tumor
fragments (1–2 mm3) were directly implanted into the
subcutaneous pockets made in one side of the lower back
of BALB/c nude mice (female, 6–8 weeks old; Orient Bio)
as previously described [60]. Some PDX tumors were
harvested and divided into two samples for DNA/RNA
extraction and histopathologic examination. The origin of
each xenograft was validated by STR DNA fingerprinting.
For in vivo drug efficacy testing, calipers were
used to measure the tumor size and tumor volume was
calculated according to the formula (a × b2)/2, where “a”
was the longest diameter and “b” was the shortest diameter
of the tumor. Mice bearing established subcutaneous
PDXs (100–150 mm3) were randomly allocated to three
groups to receive the following: vehicle (n = 9); dasatinib
15 mg/kg i.p. on a daily dosing regimen (n = 8) for up to

Evaluation of in vitro drug effects on cell
proliferation and apoptosis
To quantitatively access the fraction of PDCs
undergoing apoptosis or proliferation by dasatinib and
PKI-587 in vitro, we used an automated high-content
screening system (Operetta, Perkin Elmer). PDCs were
seeded prior to drug treatment in 384-well black wall
microplates in the culture medium at 500 cells per well.
The cells were incubated for 24 h to allow cell attachment
to the substrate and then caspase-3/7 detection reagent
(1 μM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) was added
to the samples. Dasatinib (0.5 and 1.0 μM) and PKI-587

17 days [62, 63]; or PKI-587 25 mg/kg i.v. once a week
for 17 days (n = 8) [47, 64]. Throughout the study, the
mice were weighed and the tumor burden was monitored
every 3 days. Mean tumor volumes were calculated and
growth curves were established as a function of time. After
17 days of treatment, animals were sacrificed, the tumors
were explanted, and the tumor tissue was dissected and
snap-frozen using dry ice for further processing to use in
western blotting (WB) and IHC. To decipher the signaling
pathway relevant to the antitumor effect of dasatinib and
PKI-587 on BD-138T cells, tumor tissue was isolated from
BD-138T xenografts at the end of the treatment course and
analyzed by WB. The effects of dasatinib and PKI-587
on cell proliferation and the extent of tumor apoptosis
were assessed by IHC staining of human Ki-67 (Zymed
Laboratories, San Francisco, CA, USA) and terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) assays, respectively. The TUNEL assay was
performed as previously described [65] using the DeadEnd
Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All
slides were also counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin.
The proliferative or apoptotic index was calculated as a
ratio of the Ki-67-positive or TUNEL-positive cell number
to the total cell number in high-power (x400) fields.

analyses were performed with SPSS statistical software
(Statistical Product and Services Solutions, version 19.0,
Chicago, IL, USA).

Preparation of protein extracts and WB
For WB analysis, tumors were lysed with
ice cold RIPA buffer supplemented with a protease
inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche
Diagnostics, Roswell, GA, USA). Lysates were clarified
by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min, after which
the supernatants were harvested. Protein concentrations
were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay
kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE
and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After
blocking nonspecific binding sites on the membranes
with 5% skim milk or 5% BSA for 2 h at RT, the
membranes were incubated with the indicated primary
antibodies overnight at 4°C and then with the appropriate
secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. Antibodies against
pSRC-Tyr416 (CST), p-p70S6K-Thr389 (CST). pAKTSer473 (CST), pErK(1/2)-Thr202/Tyr204 (CST), and
GAPDH (CST) were used. Immunoreactive bands were
visualized with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and
a chemiluminescent substrate by exposure to X-ray film.
