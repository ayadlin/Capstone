ABSTRACT
Oncolytic gene therapy using viral vectors may provide an attractive therapeutic
option for malignant gliomas. These viral vectors are designed in a way to selectively
target tumor cells and spare healthy cells. To determine the translational impact,
it is imperative to assess the factors that interfere with the anti-glioma effects of
the oncolytic adenoviral vectors. In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy
of survivin-driven oncolytic adenoviruses pseudotyping with adenoviral fiber knob
belonging to the adenoviral serotype 3, 11 and 35 in their ability to kill glioblastoma
(GBM) cells selectively without affecting normal cells. Our results indicate that all
recombinant vectors used in the study can effectively target GBM in vitro with high
specificity, especially the 3 knob-modified vector. Using intracranial U87 and U251
GBM xenograft models we have also demonstrated that treatment with Conditionally
Replicative Adenovirus (CRAd-S-5/3) vectors can effectively regress tumor.
However, in several patient-derived GBM cell lines, cells exhibited resistance to the
CRAd infection as evident from the diminishing effects of autophagy. To improve
therapeutic response, tumor cells were pretreated with tamoxifen. Our preliminary
data suggest that tamoxifen sensitizes glioblastoma cells towards oncolytic treatment
with CRAd-S-5/3, which may prove useful for GBM in future experimental therapy.

the tumor tissues. Adenoviral (Ad) vectors of subgroup
C have been extensively studied. Among this subgroup,
adenovirus Ad5 and Ad2 have been most frequently
used due to their ability to infect multiple cell types,
proliferate in vitro, and support efficient transgene
expression [6]. To date, ONYX015 and CRAd-S-pK7
vectors have emerged as potential candidates for antitumor therapy [7–10]. Efficiency of GBM transduction
with adenoviruses is dependent on the presence of CAR
(Coxsackie and adenovirus receptor, CAR), and αvβ3 or
αvβ5 integrins. However, due to low level of expressions

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are malignant
brain tumors in adults and children with no known cure
[1]. Advances in molecular biology of GBM reveal new
opportunities for gene therapy using adenoviral vectors.
Recent preclinical studies have shed light on the utility of
adenovirus as a vector for anti-GBM therapy [2–5]. These
adenoviruses represent an attractive mode of delivering
therapeutic load as these viruses exhibit high transduction
efficiency for cancer cells and spread effectively within

of CAR on cancer cells, transduction efficiency of
adenoviruses remains restricted to those cells that have
higher expression of the receptor. To circumvent the
problem associated with low level of primary receptor,
in the current study we have evaluated the application
of adenoviral vectors pseudotyped with subgroup B type
fibers as novel anti-GBM therapeutic agents.
The Ad serotypes in subgroup B represented by
Ad35, Ad3 and Ad11 viruses have been associated with
respiratory disease, ocular disease, and urinary tract
infection [11, 12]. Group B adenoviruses have been found
to be very effective in gene therapy because of their ability
to infect target tissues that otherwise could poorly be
transduced by commonly used adenoviral vectors. While
most adenoviruses infect cells through the CAR and
integrins receptors, adenoviruses in serotype group B use
CD46, DSG2 and unknown X receptors [13]. Ad serotype
group B viruses (e.g. Ad 5/35 virus and Ad 5/3) infect
CAR-negative cell lines more efficiently than the Ad5
vector [14]. Moreover, recent studies utilizing B-subgroup
adenovirus genotyped with adenovirus type 3 [15], type 11
[4, 16] and type 35 [5, 17] demonstrated significant antiGBM effects. However, it is not clear, which of those
specific modifications (fiber 3, 11 or 35) would exhibit
superior transduction efficiency in primary GBM cells
derived from patients. Given the fact that presence of
survivin promoter significantly improves specificity of
GBM transduction and CRAd induced toxicity [15], we
designed a panel of survivin-driven oncolytic vectors
recognizing DSG2 or CD46 receptors.
The present study was designed to evaluate GBM
transduction mediated by adenoviral vectors, whose
protruding fibers were engineered with fibers belonging to
either adenovirus type 3, 11, or 35. Using a panel of GBM
cells with different subtypes (proliferative, proneural and
mesenchymal), we assessed the ability of designed vectors
to infect GBM cells, and determined their anti-glioma
oncolytic effect in vitro and in vivo.

(p < 0.015) and CD46 (p < 0.0049) in grade III relative to
grade IV GBM specimens (Table 1). Additionally, DSG2
and CD46 are expressed ubiquitously in GBM tissues
irrespective of GBM subtypes. To investigate whether
targeting of DSG2 and CD46 receptors with adenoviral
vectors would result in increased transduction, we selected
primary patient-derived GBM cells of three molecular
subtypes (mesenchymal, proneural and proliferative).
Since cancer stem cells are believed to provide GBM
recurrence [18], chemoresistance [19–21] and radio
resistance [22, 23], we maintained these cells in stem cell
mimicking conditions (as described in the materials and
method section) to preserve stemness and characterized
them for the expression of DSG2, CD46 and CAR
markers. We observed no difference in DSG2 expression
between 13 primary cell lines and 4 GBM cell lines. In
contrast, 11 out of 13 established primary GBM cells
express CAR (Figure 1C). In addition, we [24, 25] and
others [26] have confirmed that human glioma cell lines:
U251, A172, U118, U87 and patient-derived GBM cells
strongly express CD46.

CRAd-S-5/3 inhibits GBM growth in vitro and
in vivo
To determine whether oncolytic vectors pseudotyped
with adenovirus fiber B-subgroup could confer glioma
cytotoxicity, we designed a panel of oncolytic vectors
to test their anti-cancer effect using GBM cell lines and
primary cells obtained from patients. First, we measured
the ability of oncolytic vectors (Figure 2A) to transduce
GBM cells, and to replicate specifically under the control
of the human survivin promoter. As demonstrated
(Figure 2B) A172, U118 and U87 glioma cells support
replication of the CRAd-S-5/35 vector. In these cells,
the magnitude of CRAd-S-5/35 replication was 10 fold
(A172 (6.04 × 10(5)+/-3.5 × 10(5) and U87(1.1 × 10(5)+/3.5  × 10(4)) and 1000 fold U118(2.24 × 10(6)+/-6.7 ×
10(5) higher compared to the reference AdWT vector. On
day 5 in U251 cells, CRAd-S-5/35 demonstrated lower
replication (~6 fold) compared to AdWT.
To establish whether strong level of CRAd
replication result in high GBM cytotoxicity, we performed
a crystal violet test (Figure 2C). While, the CRAd-S-5/35
vector completely killed A172 glioma cells at 0.001 PFU/
cell, the CRAd-S-5/11 and CRAd-S-5/3 recombinant
viruses required 10 and 100 infectious units to kill the
same number of cells. In both U251 and U87 cells, all
vectors (CRAd-S-5/11, CRAd-S-5/35 and CRAd-S-5/3)
exhibited the same level of glioma killing. In U118 cells,
the CRAd-S-5/11 has 10–100 fold greater anti-glioma
activity compared to CRAd-S-5/35, and CRAd-S-5/3
infections. Additionally, we observed that AdWT
exhibits highly cytopathic effect on astrocytes at a dose
of 0.001 PFU/cell (Figure 2D). For CRAd-S-5/11 and
CRAd-S-5/35 vectors, we observed similar toxicity to that

RESULTS
DSG2, CD46 and CAR expression in brain
tumor patient samples
First, we analyzed whether GBM specimens express
any primary adenoviral receptors, such as DSG2, CD46,
or CAR on the membrane surface. To analyze DSG2 cell
expression in GBM tumors, we stained primary tumors of
grade III (Oligodendroglioma) and grade IV (GBM) with
antibodies to DSG2 proteins. As presented (Figure 1A),
primary GBM has a strong staining pattern for DSG2
compared to grade III tumors. Gene expression analysis
of REMBRANDT tissue transcriptomic compendium also
indicated higher expression of DSG2 and CD46 receptors
relative to non-tumor regions of the brain (Figure 1B).We
observed significant differences in expression of DSG2

CRAd-S-5/3 effectively suppressed U87 and U251 glioma

model, and 50% survival at 46 days for U251 model).
While CRAd-S-5/3 vector showed some anti-glioma
therapeutic efficacy detected by cell survival experiments
in vitro and in vivo, AdWT, CRAd-S-WT, CRAd-S-5/11
and CRAd-S-5/35 failed to inhibit GBM progression and
survibility significantly. Compared to the CRAd-S-pK7,
we did not observe a significant difference in mice survival
between single intracranial injection of CRAd-S-pK7, and

cells. Therefore, we infected patient derived GBM cells
with CRAd vectors and determined their toxicity using
trypan blue exclusion. In GBM2, 10 IU of CRAd-S-5/3
reduced proliferation of 70% GBM cells while the same
vector reduced proliferation of 30% of GBM1 and GBM2
cells (Figure 3). Increased cytotoxicity of tumor cells in
GBM2 isolated may be related to the fact that survivin
promoter is active in these cells where, CRAd-S-5/3
required ~100 fold less viral particles to inhibit cancer
cell proliferation. We also compared the activity of
CRAd-S-5/3 versus CRAd-S-pK7 since the latter one is
in the preclinal stage of development. We observed that
in GBM1 and GBM3 cells, CRAd S-5/3 required 10–100
fold more viral particles to achieve similar cytotoxicity
relative to CRAd-S-pK7 mediated infection. In other
GBM isolates, such as GBM4 and GBM5, CRAd-S-5/3
demonstrated strong cytotoxicity (reveal the % of reduced
proliferation) 40–73% of total cells were sensitive to
CRAd-S-5/3 infection at 10 IU/cell. Data presented at
Figure 3A also suggest that primary GBM cells restrict
CRAd-S-5/3 cytotoxicity therefore increasing cytophatic
effect mediated by CRAd is desired.

CRAd-S-5/3 inhibits growth of patient derived
primary GBM cells in vitro
In general, there is growing concern that preclinical
testing of oncolytic gene therapy using GBM cell lines
may prove ineffective in clinics as primary tumor cells
may lack cellular receptors required for adenoviral vectors
to deliver the payload. Thus we investigated if survivindependent oncolytic vectors (Figure 2B and 2C) might
prove equally effective against patient derived primary

Activation of autophagy improves anti- cancer
effect of CRAd

Data presented at Figure 4A suggest that Tamoxifen improves
toxicity mediated by oncolityc CRAd-S-5/3 adenoviral
vector (between 30–60% compared to CRAd-S-5/3 alone
infection) via induction of autophagy which measured
by upregulation of LC3-II expression in the presence of
combination CRAd-S-5/3 and Tamoxifen (Figure 4B).

Autophagy is a catalytic process which plays a dual
function in cell survival and toxicity. In terms of adenoviral
infection it was shown that autophagy negatively affects
CRAd-mediated cytotoxicity. Specifically, autophagy
is required to release viral progeny and effective CRAd
infection [3, 7, 8, 27]. Our results suggest (Figure 3B) at
GBM1 and GBM2 cells CRAd infection is influenced by
inhibition of autophagy. For instance, we observed low
levels of LC3-II pro-autophagy protein is correlated with
moderate level of p62 which overall results in the low
level of autophagy. In contrast, GBM12 and GBM3 cells,
which exhibited strong autophagy that contributes to high
levels of CRAd infection, highlighting elevated expression
of cellular p62, moderate pro-autophagic LC3-II.
To improve anti-toxicity mediated by CRAd-S-5/3
vector we treated GBM4, GBM4 and GBM13 with
Tamoxifen which is known to upregulate autophagy [28].

DISCUSSION
Efficient transduction of target cells with adenoviral
particles is a two-step process. First, attachment occurs
when the viral fiber protein binds to the primary
receptor. This event is followed by viral internalization
via interactions on the cell membrane between penton
bases and integrins αVβ3, and αVβ5. Despite the presence
of primary receptors on the surface of many different
types of cancer cells, some of glioma primary cells and
cell lines [25] do not express CAR on their cell surface.
Of note, CAR receptor is the primary receptor for human
adenovirus type 5. As an alternative approach, we propose

the targeting of the CD46 receptor which is present on the
majority of glioma cells [25].
The field describing primary receptors for
adenoviral type B is controversial. There were numerous
attempts to identify the primary receptor for adenoviral
type 3, including our own. All of these studies indicated
out that adenovirus type 3 [29–31] along with adenoviral
type 11 and 35 [32] recognize CD46 as the primary
receptor. Most recently Wang H et al identified the
primary receptor of adenovirus type 35 as desmoglein 2
(DSG2). Type 3 adenovirus uses an unknown receptor
(X), while adenovirus type 11 uses receptor X and CD46
[13]. First in our study we measured expression of primary
receptors (DSG2, CD46 and CAR) in glioma cells. The
DSG2 molecule is universally expressed on the surface
of not only cancer cells, but also non-tumor tissue (Figure
1B), and possibly on human astrocytes specifically when
Ad5/35 and Ad5/11 application is decreased. Toivonen
et al, and Hoffman et al demonstrated that enhanced
transduction of glioma cells using the ad 5/35 modified
vectors resulted in an increased anti-tumor response in
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and
glioma cell lines [33, 34]. Similar data were obtained
in our study. Ad 5/11 and Ad 5/35 modified oncolytic
vectors demonstrated significant cytotoxicity in glioma
cell lines and primary specimens, which correlated with
viral replication. Of note, due to low activity of survivin
promoter compared to native E1 promoter, we observed
some suppression of viral replication in CRAd-S-WT
compared to AdWT virus. Targeting of glioma cells
with survivin-driven CRAd improves upon retargeting
of viral vectors to CD46 and/or DSG2 surface receptors
as we detected in GBM3 primary glioma cells. Based
on previous data [35], our evidence suggest that more
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

virions are getting inside targets cells compared to WT
modified vector. Thus, the efficacy of survivin driven B
group modified oncolytic vectors was assessed in vivo
using orthotropic U251 and U87 glioma intracranial
xenografts models. We observed that there is no significant
improvement in the glioma mice survival for Ad 5/11 and
Ad 5/35 vectors. Moreover, Ad5/3 modification, which
demonstrated some antiglioma activity, contributed to the
CRAd-S-5/3 therapeutic efficacy. Of note, this efficacy
was similar to CRAd-S-pK7, one of the candidates for a
clinical trial. Earlier we compared the cytopathic effect of
CRAd-S-5/3 vs CRAd-S-pK7 using glioma cell lines [36].
In our study, we demonstrated that CRAd-S-pK7 exhibited
a cytopathic effect against proneural GBM3, and classical
GBM1 glioma cells having high survivin promoter
activity. For mesenchymal-type, we observed that all
CRAds demonstrate similar therapeutic effects only at
high dose (10 IU/cell), as cells became resistant to the
low dose of CRAd infections. Of note, the mesenchymal
subtype of glioma is characterized by more aggressive
behavior and patients with mesenchymal subtype of
glioma exhibit worse prognosis than proliferative, neural
and proneural subtypes [37–39]. By comparing 5/3, 5/11
and 5/35 fiber modifications incorporated adenoviral
capside, we demonstrate that 5/3 modification provided
unique efficiency of glioma transduction in vitro and in
vivo among tested oncolytic adenoviruses, as such in the
future might lay foundation to be an efficient delivery
system to the glioma.
Targeting of glioma cells with adenoviral vectors
pseudotyped with fibers of group B1 could improve
CRAd antiglioma cytopathic effect. Although, we
observed significant glioma targeting with B pseudotyped
modified vectors, incorporation of a polylysine motif
3982

(pK7) into fiber might demonstrate much stronger benefits
for glioma virotherapy of glioma cells of proneural and
proliferative subtype. Despite benefits of using CRAd
for glioma experimental therapy, glioma cells provide
various resistances to CRAd infection such as lack of
primary receptor on the surface of glioma cells, low
activity of promoter etc. Additionally, our analyses of
patient derived glioma cells (Figure 1 and Figure 3
part B) suggest that patient derived glioma cells possess
lack of autophagy. Since autophagy is required for CRAd
progeny to be released from infected cells, new strategies
to overcome glioma resistance to CRAd infection should
be investigated. Although, this direction is out of scope
for the current manuscript, our study laid a foundation for
the future study by testing Tamoxifen [40] in combination
with CRAd against patient derived glioma cells. Our data
suggest that addition of Tamoxifen reduces proliferation of
glioma cells and therefore contribute to cytopathic effect
mediated by CRAd. Although, the precise mechanism
of that contribution remains under investigation, out
preliminary data suggest that Tamoxifen restores
autophagy. One possible reason for reduced autophagy
in primary GBM cells could be the fact that GBM cells
express glycoproteins of CMV (Supplemental Figure 1A).
Those proteins are likely can interact with autophagy
cell machinery and suppress autophagy. Most recently,
another scientific report suggests that the anti-viral drug
Valganciclovir improves survival of GBM patients [41].
In conclusion, we found that CRAd-S-5/3 oncolytic
adenoviral vector provide superior level of transduction
of primary cells and glioma cells lines. In vivo, using
U87 and U251 intracranial glioma models we determined
that CRAd-S-pK7, a candidate for clinical trials, and
CRAd-S-5/3 vectors exhibited similar efficacies of mice
survival on glioma xenografts. Killing of primary GBM
cells with CRAd-S-5/3 vectors faces challenges due to
decreasing autophagy. Treatment of glioma cells with
autophagy inducing agents such as Tamoxifen augments
CRAd anti-glioma toxicity (Supplemental Figure 1B).
These findings have a translational application since
tamoxifen and oncolytic adenoviruses are both involved
into clinical trials.

cleaned with RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen). 1
ug of total RNA was used to generate 100 ul of cDNA
using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit
(Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR for 33 genes was
performed on the ABI PRISM 7900 HT detection system

Kit I (Roche Diagnostics Corp, Indianapolis, IN). Briefly,
cancer cells were plated in 96-well plate (3,000 cells per
well) for the next day treatment. On that day, cells were
infected with various concentration of CRAd (10, 1, 0.1,
0.01 and 0.001 IU/cell) alone, or 24 hours later after
additional with Tamoxifen at concentration (100 nM).
After 1 hour of viral adsorption, virus containing media
was replaced with media containing growth factors. At
selected time points the MTT assay was conducted by
adding 10 μl of MTT reagent and incubating for 4hrs.
After, 100 μl of solubilzation solution was added to each
well, and plates were incubated overnight before they
were examined with the Microplate Reader (Model, BioRad) at 570 nm with a reference of 655 nm.
Viral replication: Human glioma cells were seeded
in DMEM/F12 medium (at 5 × 10^4 cells /well in 24well plates and allowed to grow for 24 hours at 37°C. The
following day, cells were infected with AdWT, CRAd-SWT, CRAd-S-5/3, CRAd-S-5/11, or CRAd-S-5/35 at 1
Infectious unit (pfu) per cell. Cells and supernatant were
collected and subjected to DNA isolation.

Immunofluorescence of primary GBM specimens
and cell cultures
For two-dimensional evaluation, 4-μm fresh- frozen
sections were stained with immunofluorescent anti­
bodies against desmoglein 2 (DSG2, Epitomics-Abcam,
Burlingame, CA) in combination with DAPI (Invitrogen™,
Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). As a negative
control, all stainings were performed without primary
antibody. Fluorescently labeled species-specific secondary
anti–immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody (Invitrogen™,
Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) was applied for
visualization of primary antibody. Images were captured with
Olympus IX2-UCB DSU spinning disc confocal microscope
(Olympus, Center Valley, PA) with an Evolve electronmultiplying charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics,
Tucson, AZ). Dual-color immunofluorescence was
performed at 600x magnification and a high–numerical
aperture (NA, 1.2) oil-immersion objective. Images were
acquired and stored in original SlideBook format (Intelligent
Imaging Innovations Inc, Denver, CO). After image capture,
files were saved in TIFF format.

Quantitative PCR
Total DNA was extracted from infected cells and
supernatant using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene
expression was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR
using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) and primers recognizing the viral
E1A gene [48]. DNA amplification was carried out using
the Opticon 2 system (Bio-Rad, Foster City, CA, USA),
and detection utilized the binding of the fluorescent dye,
SYBR green. Each sample was run in triplicate. Results
are presented as the average number of E1A copies per
nanogram of DNA (E1A copies per ng DNA).

Rembrandt database patient samples analyses
Rembrandt gene expression data from malignant
and non-malignant brain tumor patients was obtained from
Rembrandt data portal (https://rembrandt.nci.nih.gov)
using comprehensive Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array that
covers 47,000 cellular transcripts of whole genome.

Western blotting
Twenty micrograms of total protein was obtained
from cells lines (U87, U118, A172 and U251), or patientderived primary cell lines: mesenchymal (GBM2,
GBM4, GBM6, GBM7, GBM8), proliferative (GBM3,
GBM5, GBM10 and GBM11) and proneural (GBM1,
GBM11, GBM12 and GBM13) subtypes. To measure the
expression of human DSG2 (#5180, Epitomics-Abcam),
CD46 (ab175096, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), Coxsackie
adenoviral receptor (CAR, ab100811, Abcam, Cambridge,
MA), survivin (2808, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA),
ATG5 (#2630, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), ATG7
(#2631, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), LC3 (#NB100–
2331, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), p62/SQSTM1
(ab109012, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or cytomegalovirus
based IE1 and CMVpp65 (Virusys, MD), membranes with
immobilized proteins were incubated with the appropriate
primary antibodies overnight. The following day, proteins
were visualized using species-specific anti-IgG secondary

Viral toxicity test
Human glioma cell lines (U251, U87, U118 and
A172), or patient derived cells were seeded at 3,000 cells/
well in a 96 well plate, and allowed to grow for 24 hours at
37°C in DMEM/F12, or complete NSA medium (at 5 × 10^4
cells /well in 24-well plate for cells lines). The following day,
cells were infected with AdWT, CRAd-S-WT, CRAd-S-5/3,
CRAd-S-5/11 or CRAd-S-5/35 at 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001
Infectious units (IU) per cell. After seven days, cells were
stained with crystal violet, or MTT assays were performed.

Five to six week-old female mice were housed in
a vivarium at N.N. Blokhin Russian Oncology Center.
Entire protocol was reviewed and approved by the Animal
Care Committee of Russian Oncology Center, RAMN.
All procedures were conducted in accordance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH).
For orthotopic implantations of U87 and U251, a 2.5 μL
RPMI-based solution that contained 25,000 (U87), or
50,000 (U251) cells was implanted into the right striatum
of anesthetized mice. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with
a mixture of ketamine/xylazine, and a 0.5 mm burr hole
was then made through a scalp incision. The 30-gauge
needle was left in place for 90 seconds, and then slowly
withdrawn over a period of 60 seconds. After seven days,
intracranial injection of AdWT, CRAd-S-WT, CRAd-S-5/3,
CRAd-S-5/11, CRAd-S-5/35 or CRAd-S-pK7 vectors (100
IU/cell) was administered through the same hole used for
tumor cell implantations. Mice were monitored bi-weekly
and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted.
