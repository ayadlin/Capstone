ABSTRACT
Cisplatin exert its anticancer effect by creating intrastrand and interstrand DNA
cross-links which block DNA replication and is a major drug used to treat lung cancer.
However, the main obstacle of the efficacy of treatment is drug resistance. Here, we show
that expression of translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerase Q (POLQ) was significantly
elevated by exposure of lung cancer cells A549/DR (a cisplatin-resistant A549 cell line)
to cisplatin. POLQ expression correlated inversely with homologous recombination (HR)
activity. Co-depletion of BRCA2 and POLQ by siRNA markedly increased sensitivity of
A549/DR cells to cisplatin, which was accompanied with impairment of double strand
breaks (DSBs) repair reflected by prominent cell cycle checkpoint response, increased
chromosomal aberrations and persistent colocalization of p-ATM and 53BP1 foci induced
by cisplatin. Thus, co-knockdown of POLQ and HR can efficiently synergize with cisplatin
to inhibit A549/DR cell survival by inhibiting DNA DSBs repair. Similar results were
observed in A549/DR cells co-depleted of BRCA2 and POLQ following BMN673 (a PARP
inhibitor) treatment. Importantly, the sensitization effects to cisplatin and BMN673 in
A549/DR cells by co-depleting BRCA2 and POLQ was stronger than those by co-depleting
BRCA2 and other TLS factors including POLH, REV3, or REV1. Our results indicate that
there is a synthetic lethal relationship between pol θ-mediated DNA repair and HR
pathways. Pol θ may be considered as a novel target for lung cancer therapy.

of drug metabolism and inactivation, defects in apoptosis
programs, and enhanced DNA repair capacity [5, 6].
Enhanced DNA repair pathways are found in a subset of
drug-resistant cancer cells [7–10]. Therefore, DNA damage
repair is one of main cisplatin resistant mechanisms.
Repair of ICLs requires the coordination of multiple
DNA repair pathways including Fanconi anemia (FA),
Homologous recombination (HR), translesion synthesis
(TLS) pathways, and endonuclease-mediated DNA
processing [11–14]. The FA pathway is composed of at
least 20 genes, which are named FANCA through FANCU.
The proteins encoded by these genes act cooperatively in
the FA pathway to coordinate the repair of DNA ICLs [11].
The eight upstream FA factors and several FA associated
proteins (including FAAP20) assemble into FA core complex
which monoubiquitinate FANCD2 [12]. Monoubiquitinated

INTRODUCTION
Platinum-based chemotherapy agents, such as
cisplatin, are first-line treatment drugs of advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The anticancer effect
of cisplatin is though its ability to covalently interact
with guanine residues in DNA resulting in the formation
of both intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links
(ICLs) [1, 2]. Although ICLs comprised only a small
fraction of the induced DNA damage, these are the most
cytotoxic and genotoxic lesions produced by cisplatin
[2–4]. However, the effectiveness of the therapy is often
compromised largely because cancer cells develop
resistance to the drug [3, 4]. Multiple mechanisms that
mediate intrinsic or acquired resistance to cisplatin have
been identified, including decreased drug uptake, increase

FANCD2 recruits some endonuclease to the site of DNA
damage to make incisions on different intermediates in
ICL repair, which convert replication forks stalled at ICLs
to double strand breaks (DSBs) to initiate HR-mediated
repair [15–17]. Importantly, several HR components are
part of the FA pathway. For instance, FANCD1/BRCA2 and
FANCO/RAD51C, which are the FA pathway downstream
factors and mainly facilitate the loading of RAD51 to initiate
the HR process [18–20]. TLS, carried out by a numerous
mutagenic DNA polymerases, such as Pol η (encoded by
POLH), Pol ζ (consisting of the catalytic subunit REV3
and the structural subunit REV7), and REV1, protects the
genome from large deletion by replicating across ICLs and
other occluding lesions [13, 21–23]. TLS polymerases are
essential for ICL repair to bypass an ICL unhooked from
one of the two cross-links strands [11, 12]. Pol ζ and REV1
are key factors in ICL repair, as cells deficient in either one
of these genes are exquisitely sensitive to cross-linking
agents [24, 25]. Human cells deficient in Pol η are also
hypersensitive to cross-linking agents such as cisplatin and
psoralen [26, 27]. However, the role of Pol θ (encoded by
POLQ) in the cell is still a matter of debate. In vertebrate
cells, there are conflicting reports concerning the sensitivity
of Pol θ to ICL-inducing agents. DT40 cells lacking Pol θ
were not hypersensitive to cisplatin [28, 29]. But depletion
of POLQ can sensitized mouse CH12B-lymphama cells
to cisplatin and mitomycin (MMC) [30, 31]. The chaos 1
(a mutant allele of POLQ) mutant mice and cells derived
from them exhibited no hypersensitivity to MMC, implying
that POLQ does not participate in the repair of ICLs in vivo
[32]. Accumulating evidence suggests a role for POLQ in
the repair or tolerance of DSBs. Mouse bone marrow cells
deleted for POLQ are more sensitive than normal cells to
ionizing radiation (IR) and bleomycin, both of which are
known to produce DSBs [33]. Depleting of POLQ in human
cancer cells caused an increase in IR-induced γH2AX foci
and sensitized the cells to γ-irradiation [34]. Recent studies
showed that pol θ participated in microhomology mediated
end-joining (MMEJ) which is an error-prone alternative
DSB repair pathway that utilizes sequence microhomology
to recombine broken DNA [35–38]. Whether Pol θ interacts
with classical DNA repair pathways to offer cisplatin
resistance remains unknown. In the present study, we
examine the contribution of Pol θ to cisplatin resistance in
NSCLC cells in comparison with Pol η, REV3 and REV1,
and investigate whether Pol θ is involved in repair and
tolerance of cisplatin-induced DNA damage in cooperation
with HR.

NSCLC cell line A549/DR which were generated
by continuous exposure of A549 cells to increasing
concentration of cisplatin for a 10 month period. We
compared the cell survival of A549/DR cells with A549
and SK-MES-1 cells (a lung squamous cell carcinoma
line) after treatment with cisplatin, carboplatin, or
BMN673 (a PARP inhibitor). As expected, A549 cells
survival was significantly decreased than that of A549/
DR cells following treatment with cisplatin or carboplatin
(Figure 1A). A549 cells were only slightly more sensitive
to BMN673 than A549/DR cells. In addition, SK-MES-1
cells were more sensitive to cisplatin than A549/DR cells.
Similar results were observed in colony formation assay
when the three cell lines were treated with same drugs
(Supplementary Figure S1A). To determine the role of
POLQ in A549/DR cell resistance to cisplatin, we detected
the mRNA and protein expression of POLQ and FA, HR,
and other TLS factors including FANCD2, FAAP20,
BRCA2, RAD51C, POLH, REV3, and REV1. The results
showed that the mRNA and protein expressions of these
TLS and HR factors in A549/DR cells were elevated as
compared with A549 and SK-MES-1 cells (Figure 1B
to 1E). However, elevated extent of POLQ expression
was more significant than that of FA, HR and other
TLS factors in A549/DR cells. To investigate molecular
mechanism underlying the protective effect of Pol θ on
A549/DR cells upon treatment with cisplatin, the timedependent expressions of POLQ mRNA was examined by
real-time quantitative (RTQ)-PCR. Increased expression
of POLQ mRNA was detectable 8 hours after cisplatin
treatment and was constantly increasing during the 24hour post-incubation period (Figure 2A). Induction of
POLQ mRNA was accompanied by an increase in the
levels of Pol θ protein (Figure 2B). Meantime, timedependent elevations of POLH, REV3, or REV1 in both
mRNA and protein levels were observed in A549/DR cells
following cisplatin treatment, but the raised extent of these
TLS factor expressions was markedly lower than that of
POLQ (Figure 2A and 2B). Additionally, increases of
these TLS factor expression were not obvious in A549 and
SK-MES-1 cells after cisplatin treatment (Figure 2C and
2D, and Supplementary Figure S1B-S1D). The findings
suggest that Pol θ may play a more important role in
acquired resistance of A549/DR cells to cisplatin.

Impact of Pol θ on the sensitivity to cisplatin in
A549/DR cells
Since expression levels of POLQ mRNA and protein
are higher than those of POLH, REV3 and REV1 in A549/
DR cells following exposure to cisplatin, we expected
that depletion of POLQ in the cells would result in more
hypersensitivity to cisplatin compared with knockdown of
other TLS factors by siRNA transfections (Figure 3A). By
contrast, we found that POLH, REV3, or REV1 siRNAtransfected A549/DR cells exhibited greater sensitivity
to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, although transfection

of siRNA against POLQ also sensitize A549/DR cells
to cisplatin (Figure 3B). Similarly, A549 cells depleting
POLH, REV3 or REV1 were more sensitive to cisplatin
compared to the cells depleted of POLQ (Figure 3C).
Depleting SK-MES-1 cells the four TLS factors achieved
the same results as A549 cells (Supplementary Figure
S1E). In addition, we examined the impact of TLS factors
on sensitivity to PARP inhibitor in the lung cancer cells,
and fond that knockdown of the four TLS factors slightly
enhanced sensitivity of A549/DR and A549 cells to BMN
(Figure 3D and 3E). Meanwhile, A549/DR cells depleted
of POLQ, POLH, REV3 or REV1 after cisplatin treatment
generated cell cycle arrest in S and G2 phases compared to
the cells without cisplatin treatment (Figure 3F).
Activation of ATM and ATR kinases are well
characterized response to DNA damage such as DSBs or
replication fork stalling [39, 40]. Therefore, we measured
the phosphorylation of ATM and ATR substrates (e.g.,
H2AX, CHK1 and CHK2) as surrogate markers for DSBs

and replication stress as a result of deficient TLS [41,
42], and examined whether depletion of POLQ, POLH,
REV3 or REV1 in A549/DR and A549 cells lead to
replication stalling and activations of ATM and ATR after
cisplatin treatment. The results showed that knockdown
of POLQ, POLH, REV3 or REV1 in the two cell lines
strikingly increased the intensity of γH2AX in term of
expression levels and the percentage of cells with 10
γH2AX foci following cisplatin treatment (Figure 4A to
4F, and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). In line with
the results of cell survival analysis, the increase of γH2AX
foci formation in cells depleting REV3 or REV1 was more
obvious compared with cells lacking POLQ or POLH
(Figure 4A and 4B). Enhanced phosphorylations of CHK1
and CHK2 cell cycle checkpoint kinases were found in
the two cell lines depleted of POLQ, POLH, REV3 or
REV1, but levels of phosphorylated CHK1 and CHK2 did
not differ between cells depleted of POLQ or POLH and
REV3 or REV1 knockdown cells (Figure 4C to 4F). These

in promoting tolerance and resistance to cisplatin in
addition to bypassing DNA adduct.

with HR activity, and lung cancer cells with higher-POLQ
expression may be companied with HR deficiency, which
is agree with the findings in epithelial ovarian cancer cells
reported by Cacceldi et al [44].

POLQ expression correlated inversely with HR
activity in A549/DR cells

Co-depletion of POLQ and HR genes efficiently
synergize with cisplatin to suppress A549/DR
cells survival

Previous studies indicated that POLQ was
implicated in the tolerance or repair of DSBs induced
by cisplatin. We then assess the relationship between
POLQ expression and HR. We found that knockdown of
POLQ in A549/DR and A549 cells caused a remarkably
increase of RAD51 in term of expression levels and
number of cells with RAD51 foci (Figure 4C to 4G, and
Supplementary Figure S2C and S2D). Although POLH,
REV3 or REV1-depleted A549/DR and A549 cells also
displayed higher RAD51 expression levels and more
numbers of cells with RAD51 foci than siControl cells,
which is similar to POLH, REV3, or REV1 knockdown
HeLa cell displaying raised RAD51 foci number after
exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) [43], the increase of
expression levels and foci formation of RAD51 were
inferior to POLQ-depleted A549/DR and A549 cells
(Figure 4C to 4G and Supplementary Figure S2C and
S2D). On the other hands, siRNA-mediated inhibition
of HR genes including BRCA2, RAD51C, FAAP20
or FANCD2 increased POLQ expression in mRNA
and protein levels (Figure  5A to 5C), taken together,
suggesting that POLQ expression correlated inversely

To determine whether there is the synthetic
lethality between POLQ and HR genes, we performed
cell survival assay in A549/DR and A549 cells treated
with cisplatin or BMN673 (a PARP inhibitor) following
co-transfection with siRNAs targeting POLQ and HR
genes. The transfection efficiency was verified in parallel
experiments by Western blot analysis (Figure 3A and
Figure  5A). The results shown that co-knockdown of
POLQ and BRCA2, or FANCD2 in the two cell lines
resulted in hypersensitivity to cisplatin as compared with
individual depletion of FANCD2, BRCA2, or POLQ
(Figure 5D and Supplementary Table S1A). Similar
results were found in colony formation assay (Figure 5F).
Moreover, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of
cisplatin in A549/DR co-depleting POLQ and BRCA2, or
FANCD2 were even lower than those in A549 cells with
the same gene depletions, indicating that the sensitization
effect of co-knockdown of POLQ and BRCA2, or
FANCD2 in A549/DR cells was stronger than in A549
cells (Supplementary Figure S3B and Supplementary

Table S1A). Similarly, A549/DR cells co-depleted of
POLQ and FANCD2 or BRCA2 were more sensitive to
BMN673 than those depleting FANCD2, or BRCA2, or
POLQ alone (Figure 5D and Supplementary Table S1B).
Also, the sensitization to BMN673 in A549/DR cells by
co-depleting POLQ and BRCA2 or FANCD2 was more
significant than those in A549 cells (Supplementary Figure
S3B and Supplementary Table S1B).
We further assess the impact of co-knockdown
of HR and other three TLS genes on cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity. The results showed that the A549/DR cells
co-depleted of both BRCA2 and POLH, or REV3, or
REV1 were more sensitive to cisplatin or BMN673
than the cells depleting BRCA2 alone (Figure 5E,
and Supplementary Table S1C and S1D). Importantly,
suppression of survival in A549/DR cells co-depleted
of BRCA2 and POLQ were more significant than in the
cells co-depleted of both BRCA2 and POLH, or REV3,
or REV1 after treatment with cisplatin or BMN673
(Figure 5D and 5E, and Supplementary Table S1C and
S1D). A549 cells co-depleted of BRCA2 and POLQ did
not show the sensitization effect like A549/DR cells to
cisplatin and BNM673 (Supplementary Figure S3C and
Supplementary Table S1C and S1D). Meanwhile, cell
cycle analysis showed that double knockdown of BRCA2
and POLQ, or POLH, or REV3, or REV1 in A549/DR
cells evoked prominent cisplatin-induced S/G2 arrest,
but the cells co-depleted of BRCA2 and POLQ exhibited
notably increased levels of death as reflected by emerging
more Sub-G1 cells in response to cisplatin (Figure 5H).

A549/DR cells displayed a dramatic increase in cisplatininduced chromatid gaps and breaks per metaphase
compared to the cells depleting BRCA2 or POLQ alone
and the cells co-depleting BRCA2 and REV3 (Figure 6C
and Supplementary Figure S4B).
Localization of activated ATM protein kinase and
53BP1 to DSB are both well characterized surrogate
markers of DSBs [41, 46]. Therefore, we test the
formation of foci marked by activated ATM colocalized
with 53BP1 in cisplatin-treated A549/DR cells. The results
showed that the percentage of BRCA2 and POLQ codepleted cells exhibiting P-ATM and 53BP1-colocalized
foci persisted at higher levels 48 hours after cisplatin
treatment, suggesting that DSB repair in these cells was
affected to a larger degree, compared to the cells depleting
BRCA2 or POLQ alone, and the cells co-depleted of
BRCA2 and POLH, or REV3, or REV1 (Figure 6E). In
addition, co-depletion of BRCA2 and POLQ also led to
a significant elevation of chromatid gaps and breaks per
metaphase in BMN673-treated A549/DR cells (Figure 6D
and Supplementary Figure S4B). In line with a prominent
increase of chromosome aberration, co-depletion of
BRCA2 and POLQ resulted in notably enhanced γ-H2AX
staining by immunofluorescence post-treatment with
BMN673 (Supplementary Figure S4C).

DISCUSSION
An increasing amount of evidence indicate that
DNA repair ability is one of main determinants in offering
chemoresistance to cisplatin, and the development of
cisplatin resistance is a dynamic process involving
multiple DNA repair pathway [5, 6]. Here, we show that
A549/DR cells, a cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cell line,
exhibited increased expression levels of FA, HR and TLS
pathway factors compared with their parent cell line A549
and another lung cancer cell line SK-MES-1 which is
relative sensitivity to cisplatin. However, the increased
extent of POLQ in both mRNA and protein levels in
A549/DR cells were more obvious than other TLS
factors including POLH, REV3 and REV1. Furthermore,
induction of POLQ expression by cisplatin in A549/DR
cells reached the highest levels among the TLS factors
tested in this study, suggesting that POLQ may play a
more important role in generation of acquired cisplatin
resistance in A549/DR cell. However, the results of cell
survival assay did not support this conjecture, in which
the sensitization effect to cisplatin in A549/DR cells by
depleting POLQ was inferior to that in the cells deficient
in POLH, or REV3, or REV1. The percentage of γH2AX
foci positive A549/DR cells depleting POLQ was lower
than the cells depleted of REV3 or REV1, although cells
individually depleted of POLQ, POLH, REV3, or REV1
displayed similar and enhanced cell cycle checkpoint
response, as measured by the phosphorylated H2AX,
CHK1 and CHK2 kinase expression.

Impact of co-depletion of POLQ and HR genes
on repair of cisplatin-induced DNA damage
Since POLQ and HR factors are involved in
the repair of DSBs, and POLQ expression correlated
inversely with HR activity, we investigated whether
POLQ cooperate with HR genes in repairing DNA damage
produced by cisplatin. Western blot assay showed that
co-depletion of BRCA2 and POLQ caused dramatically
potentiated phosphorylation of H2AX, CHK1 and CHK2
compared with BRCA2 depletion alone in A549/DR
and A549 cells after cisplatin treatment (Figure 6A and
Supplementary Figure S3D). Similar results were observed
when phosphorylation of KAP1 on Ser-428 by ATM and
ATR kinases, another marker for DNA damage response
[45], was analyzed (Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure
S3D). Furthermore, co-depletion of BRCA2 and one of
the four TLS factors markedly inhibited HR repair of
I-SceI induced DSB as indicated by GFP positive cells
(Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure S4A). But the
most significant reduction in gene conversion frequency
was observed in A549/DR cells co-depleted of BRCA2
and POLQ (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure S4A).

It is now recognized that the cooperation action of
Pol η Pol ζ and REV1 is required for replicative bypass of
DNA intrastrand cross-links, including those generated by
cisplatin [26, 47–49]. What is more, Polζ and REV1 are
necessary for the repair of cisplatin interstrand cross-links
and DSBs caused by cisplatin, MMC or IR [42, 43]. In
fact, Pol θ is also very efficient at incorporating nucleotides
opposite abasic sites and then extending past the lesion
[50, 51], and is involved in the repair of DSBs produced
by cisplatin, etoposide, bleomycin, and IR [30, 33, 34]. In
this study, further analysis show that depletion of POLQ
in A549/DR and A549 cells remarkably increased RAD51
expression and its foci formation, and the inhibition of HR
pathway by depleting BRCA2 or RAD51C increased Pol θ
expression, which is accordance with the results reported
by Ceccaldi et al [44]. These findings suggest that Pol θ
in lung cancer cells suppress HR activity and participate
in DSB repair through alternative pathway. We showed
that co-depletion of POLQ and BRCA2 or FANCD2
significantly increased sensitivity of A549/DR cells to
cisplatin compare to individual depletion of BRCA2, or
FANCD2, or POLQ. Moreover, the sensitization effects

to cisplatin by co-depleting BRCA2 and POLQ in A549/
DR cells were stronger than those in the cells co-depleted
of both BRCA2 and POLH, or REV3 or REV1, indicating
that there is a synthetic lethal relationship between Pol
θ-mediated DNA repair and HR pathway in A549/DR cells.
In addition, inhibition of survival induced by cisplatin in
A549/DR cells co-depleted of BRCA2 and POLQ was
greater than that in A549 cells co-depleted of BRCA2 and
POLQ, further supporting this notion. Consistent with the
notion is the findings that the hypersensitization effect to
cisplatin by co-depleting POLQ and BRCA2 in the cells
was associated with a potentiated cell cycle checkpoint
response and a marked increase in cisplatin-induced
chromosome aberrations. And co-depleting A549/DR
cells of BRCA2 and POLQ led to a greater decrease in
HR repair produced by the I-SceI, reflected by measuring
GFP positive cells, compared to individual knockdown of
BRCA2 or POLQ, and double knockdown of BRCA2 and
POLH, or REV3, or REV1.
It is well known that DSBs are the most lethal lesions
induced by cisplatin, and repaired by two major pathways

(NHEJ) [52]. In addition to these two well-established
repair modes, an alternative end-joining pathway (called
MMEJ) was recently described [53, 54]. MMEJ promotes
inter-and intra-chromosome re-arrangements associated
with DNA deletions by utilizing sequence microhomology
to recombine broken DNA end [35-39, 53, 54]. Pol θ was
recently identified to play a major role in MMEJ of DSBs
in C. elegans, mice and human cells [36-38, 44]. MMEJ is
generally not the preferred method of DSB repair in health
cells, but it is increasingly important in cell deficient in
HR [55]. Although the physiologically relevant contexts
for when MMEJ is the repair route of choice remains
unknown, several studies suggested that Pol θ is important
in repairing replication-associated DSBs in cells that
fail to bypass endogenous DNA lesions [37] or unwind
thermodynamically stable DNA structure [35]. The recent
findings that HR-deficient cancer cell are dependent on
repair executed by Pol θ suggest that HR and MMEJ can
act on similar substrate [44], and there may be a constraint
or a complementary relationship between Pol θ and HR
pathway, perhaps these studies may explain our findings
that co-knockdown of BRCA2 and POLQ can efficiently
synergize with cisplatin to inhibit survival of cisplatinresistant lung cancer cells. Further investigations are
required to clarify the mechanisms that there is a synthetic
lethal relationship between POLQ-mediated DNA repair
and HR pathway.
In this study, another interesting finding is that coknockdown of POLQ and BRCA2, or FANCD2 caused
more notable sensitization effect on BMN673 compared
with individual knockdown of BRCA2, FANCD2, or
POLQ in A549/DR cells. Corresponding to the result
is that the percentage of γH2AX foci positive cells and
numbers of chromatid aberrations per metaphase were
dramatically elevated in A549/DR cell co-depleted of
BRCA2 and POLQ following BMN673 treatment. PARP1
is a protein involved in single-strand break (SSD) repair
through base excision repair (BER), and is another key
factor in alternative end-joining pathway [56–58]. PARP
inhibitors (PARPi) mainly suppress BER, which can result
in DSBs and replication fork collapse. Those DSBs can
be effectively repaired via the HR pathway. Inhibition of
the BER pathway, taken together with deficiency of HR,
creates a synthetic lethality, which can be exacerbated
when used in conjunction with suppression of alternative
end-joining pathway or chemotherapy agents [59, 60].
Therefore our results may be interpreted by the notion that
the combination of HR deficiency and Pol θ loss by siRNA
transfection with suppression of PARP by PARPi can lead
to a more potent effect of synthetic lethality.
In conclusion, we show for the first time that POLQ
expression was markedly up-regulated by exposure of
cisplatin-resistant NSCLC A549/DR cells to cisplatin.
POLQ expression and HR activity were inversely related.
Co-depletion of POLQ and HR factors such as BRCA
in A549/DR cell resulted in a significant sensitization
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

effect to cisplatin or BMN673, and conduced prominent
activation of cell checkpoint kinases and an increase in
cisplatin and BMN673-induced chromosomal aberrations.
Thus our study identifies novel synthetic lethal interactions
between POLQ-mediated DNA repair and HR pathway
that may be utilized for NSCLC adjuvant therapy with
cisplatin. Before POLQ can be considered as a novel
target in NSCLC therapy, it roles in the mechanisms of
cisplatin-resistance will need to be further investigated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and materials
A549 (a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line),
A549/DR (a cisplatin-resistant A549 cell line), and SKMES-1 (a human lung squamous cell carcinoma cell
line) were purchased from the Shanghai Institute for
Biological Science (China). The cells were cultured
in RPMT-1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine
serum, 1% glutamine, 100μl/ml penicillin, 100μl/ml
streptomycin. A549/DR cells were routinely maintained
in culture media containing 0.5μg/ml cisplatin and growth
in drug free media for 3 days before the experiment.
Antibodies to the following antigen used in this study
include: FANCD2, FAAP20, RAD51c, RAD51, Pol θ,
Pol η, REV3, REV1, 53BP1, and gapdh were from Santa
Cruz, BRCA2, p-ATM, p-CHK1 (S317), p-CHK2 (T68),
p-KAP1(S824) were from Calibiochem, and γH2AX and
H2AX were from Cell Signaling. Cisplatin was from
Yangtze River Pharmaceutica, Carboplatin were from
Qilu Pharmaceutical CO., Ltd, BMN673 was from Selleck
Chemicals.

Real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted from various cell
specimens using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse
transcription were conducted using Applied Biosystem’s
Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and the actions
were run on an ABI 7500 Fast Real-time PCR system, as
previously described [61]. The specific primer sequences
of the genes detected in this study are showed in
Supplementary Table S2.

Cell survival measurement and colony formation
assay
Cell survival was detected by cell counting-kit
(CCK-8) assay according to manufacturer’s instruction,
as previously described [62]. The IC50 concentration
was calculated as the cisplatin or BMN673 concentration
that kills 50% of cells of untreated control. For colony
formation assay, cells were replaced at a density of 500
cells per well onto a 6-well culture plate in DMEM
containing 10% FBS. After two weeks, the cells were

fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then
stained by using 0.05% crystal violet in ddH2O for 15
min. Alternatively, for examination of clonogenic ability
of the cells with drug treatment, a density of 1000 cells per
well seeded onto a 6-well culture plate and the indicated
drugs at various dose or vehicle in DMEM containing 10%
FBS was added to the cultures at 3 day after seeding. The
cultures were continuously maintained for another 7 days
and subjected to the colony formation assay. Colonies
produced by each cell-group were counted and measured
using Image Software.

harvesting. Cells were treated for 20 min at 37°C with a
hypotonic solution consisting of 0.075M KCl and then
fixed with 3:1 methanol/acetic acid. Cells were dropped
onto slides and allowed to dry for a day, and then the
chromosomes were stained with Giemsa prior to analysis.
A total of 50 mitotic spreads were analyzed for each
treatment. The relative number of gaps and breaks per
metaphase was calculated relative to control cells.

Homologous recombination assay
HR assay was conducted by using a GFP-based
method as previously reported [63]. In brief, cells were
transfected with various siRNAs as above and treated
with 10μM cisplatin for 2 h, and efficiency of HR was
assessed by co-transfecting an I-SceI expression plasmid
(pCBASce) with a GFP-reporter substrate (DR-GFP).
The assay works through gene conversion repair of a
DSB caused by I-Sce I digestion, such that the DRGFP plasmides repair by HR express GFP. Cells were
transiently transfected with 1μg of DR-GFP plus 3μg of
I-SceI expressing vector or 1μg of DR-GFP plus 3μg of
control plasmids (Amaxa Biotechnology). The number
of GFP-positive cells was evaluated using the Becton
Bicknson FACScan, analyzed with the FlowJo Softeware.

Western blot
Cells were exposure to the indicated drugs, and
proteins from whole cell lysates were prepared and
detected using Western blot assay as previously described
[61]. The antibodies used to detect the proteins in this
study were described above.

Transfection with siRNA
Cells were seeded at a density of 105 per well of
a 6-well plate. Transfection of siRNA into the cells was
carried out with Lipofection 2000 (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol, as described previously
[61]. The sequences of siRNA targeting FANCD2,
FAAP20, BRCA2, RAO51C, POLQ, POLH, REV3
and REV1 are described and characterized with respect
to knockdown efficiency (Supplementary Table S3 and
Figure 3A and 5A).

Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as the mean ± SEM of at
least three independent experiments. Data were analyzed
for statistical significance by using the 2-tailed unpaired
Student t tests or Fisher’s exact test for categorical data.
Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.

Cell cycle analysis and immunofluorescence
For cell cycle analysis, A549/DR cells were
transfected with siRNAs as described above and allowed
to recover another 2h. Transfected cells were treated
with 5μM cisplatin for 1h and washed, harvested 24h
later, and fixed in 70% ethanol. The cells were stained
with propidium iodide in the presence of RNase A, and
then analyzed on a FACS caliber flow cytometer (Becton
Dicknson). For immunofluorescence, siRNA transfected
A549/DR cells were treated with cisplatin, and treated
with 100% methanol 24h later and stained with antiγH2AX, anti-RAD51, anti-P-ATM, anti-53BP1 and Alexa
Fluor dye-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit
secondary antibody. Images were taken with an Ax-70
microscope (Olympus) and analyzed using Image-Pro
software (Medica Cybernetics). Each experiment was
performed in triplicate.
