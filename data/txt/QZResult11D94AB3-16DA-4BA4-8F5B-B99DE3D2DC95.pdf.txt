ABSTRACT
Fas signaling promotes metastasis of gastrointestinal (GI) cancer cells by
inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and EMT acquisition has been
found to cause cancer chemoresistance. Here, we demonstrated that the response to
chemotherapy of GI cancer patients with higher expression of FasL was significantly
worse than patients with lower expression. Fas-induced activation of the ERK1/2MAPK pathway decreased the sensitivity of GI cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
agents and promoted the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). FasL promoted
chemoresistance of GI cancer cell via upregulation of P-gp by increasing β-catenin and
decreasing miR-145. β-catenin promoted P-gp gene transcription by binding with P-gp
promoter while miR-145 suppressed P-gp expression by interacting with the mRNA
3’UTR of P-gp. Immunostaining and qRT-PCR analysis of human GI cancer samples
revealed a positive association among FasL, β-catenin, and P-gp, but a negative
correlation between miR-145 and FasL or P-gp. Altogether, our results showed Fas
signaling could promote chemoresistance in GI cancer through modulation of P-gp
expression by β-catenin and miR-145. Our findings suggest that Fas signaling-based
cancer therapies should be administered cautiously, as activation of this pathway
may not only lead to apoptosis but also induce chemoresistance.

Fas signaling promotes motility and metastasis through
inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in
gastrointestinal (GI) cancer [7].
EMT is a complex molecular and cellular program
by which epithelial cells shed their differentiated
characteristics, including cell-cell adhesion, planar and
apical-basal polarity, and lack of motility, but acquire
instead mesenchymal features, including motility,
invasiveness and a heightened resistance to apoptosis [8].
EMT has also been found to result in stem cell-like
characteristic cells that have a propensity to invade
surrounding tissues and display resistance to certain

INTRODUCTION
Fas (APO-1/CD95) is a member of the TNF
and NGF transmembrane receptor superfamily and
activates caspase-dependent apoptosis in susceptible
cells when triggered by its cognate ligand, FasL/CD95L
[1]. However, Fas signaling also controls non-apoptotic
cell events including the regulation of cell cycle
progression [2], cytokine and chemokine expression
[3, 4], tumor growth [5] and motility [6], through
various cellular signaling pathways, such as NFκB [6]
and MAPK [4, 6]. Moreover, we recently reported that

therapeutic interventions [8]. EMT can be triggered by
different kinds of stimuli [8], some of which ultimately
lead to the upregulation of transcription factors like Twist,
Snail, and Slug [9]. Overexpression of these transcriptional
factors has been linked to resistance to chemotherapeutics,
while depletion of them has been found to increase drug
sensitivity [10], suggesting that different stimulus-induced
EMT may contribute to chemoresistance via distinct
mechanisms. Though Fas signaling was found to induce
EMT, it is still unknown whether Fas signaling plays a role
in the chemoresistance of cancer cells.
Chemotherapy is the main treatment option for
patients with advanced GI cancer. However, cancer cells
often become refractory to chemotherapeutic agents owing
to the acquirement of multidrug resistance (MDR) [11].
One of the major mechanisms of multidrug resistance
is the expression of ATP-binding cassette superfamily
proteins (ABC transporters). ABC transporters are
ubiquitously and heterogeneously expressed in various
body tissues and important pharmacological barriers,
which play a pivotal role in host cell detoxification and
protection of the body against xenobiotics [11]. ABC
transporters can actively efflux a variety of clinical drugs
like estramustine, mitoxantrone, and anthracyclines [11].
Overexpression of ABC transporter has been found to
correlate with aggressive and invasive cancers, which tend
to be more chemoresistant [12]. Sixteen ABC transporters
have been identified in MDR [12]. The ABCB1 transporter,
also known as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is encoded by
human multidrug resistance 1 gene (MDR1) and is an
important mediator of drug resistance [13]. P-gp has been
found to be correlated with the intrinsic and acquired
drug resistance in several neoplasms and represents the
failure of chemotherapeutic treatments and poor prognosis
of cancer [13]. Whether Fas signaling promotes cancer
chemoresistance via MDR in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer
remains to be determined.
In this study, we have investigated the association
of Fas signaling with chemoresistance in GI cancer
and explored the underlying mechanisms both in vitro
and in vivo. We found that Fas activation promoted the
chemoresistance in GI cancer through induction of
P-gp expression via upregulating nuclear β-catenin and
downregulating miR-145 expression.

cancer SW480, DLD1 and AGS cells with FasL before
treatment of chemotherapeutic agents (5-Fu, SN38, or
Oxaliplatin) and then detected cell viability. FasL alone
did not apparently affect cell viability. Either 5-Fu, SN38,
or Oxaliplatin significantly reduced the cell viability
in all the three cell lines. Interestingly, we found that
the cell viability was significantly higher in GI cancer
cells treated with FasL in advance than that treated with
drugs directly (Figures 1A, 1B and 1C), indicating that
activation of Fas signaling confers GI cancer cells resistant
to chemotherapies. The ERK1/2 MAPK pathway is
activated by Fas signaling and required for FasL-induced
EMT and motility [7]. We asked whether FasL-induced
chemoresistance depends on the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway.
For this, we additionally treated these cells with a MEK1/2
specific inhibitor U0126 or PD98095 (data not shown)
and found that U0126 or PD98095 (data not shown)
significantly abolished the FasL-induced resistance to
5-Fu, SN38, or Oxaliplatin (Figures 1D, 1E and 1F). These
data showed that activation of Fas signaling confers GI
cancer cells resistant to chemotherapies in an ERK1/2
MAPK pathway dependent way.
To extend our above observation in clinic, we
investigated the relationship between chemotherapy
(FOLFIRI: 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan) response and
the expression status of FasL in GI cancer specimens
examined by both qRT-PCR and immunohistochemitry.
In both CRC and GC, patients with lower expression
of FasL responded better to chemotherapy than patients
with higher expression of FasL (Table 1, Figure 1G and
1H), indicating that Fas signaling may contribute to
chemoresistance of GI cancer.

P-glycoprotein is a key transporter for
FasL-induced chemoresistance
ABC transporters actively efflux a wide spectrum
of commonly employed chemotherapeutic drugs.
Overexpression of ABC transporters plays a key role in the
chemoresistance in lots of cancers [11, 12]. We proposed
that Fas activation might induce expression of certain
ABC tranporters to acquire chemoresistance. With qRTPCR-based analysis, we assessed the mRNA levels of the
16 ABC transporters, which were found to be implicated in
drug resistance [12], in SW480, DLD1 and AGS cells after
FasL stimulation. We found that the 16 ABC transporters
were heterogeneously expressed in GI cells with
ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCC6 overexpressed in SW480
(Figure 2A), DLD1 (Figure 2B) and AGS cells (Figure
2C) following Fas signaling activation. Among them,
ABCB1 (P-gp) expression was significantly upregulated
much more than the other ABC transporters (Figures
2A, 2B and 2C). Consistent with the induction of mRNA
levels, immunoblots showed apparent upregulation of the
protein levels of ABCB1 and ABCC1 by FasL. Further,
inhibition of ERK1/2 MAPK pathway by U0126 abolished

RESULTS
Activation of Fas signaling may result in
chemoresistance of GI cancer
Recently, we reported that Fas signaling promoted
the motility and metastasis of GI cancer cells through
induction of EMT [7]. Besides the increased motility
and metastasis, cancer cells acquiring EMT may have
an enhanced resistance to chemotherapeutics-induced
apoptosis [8]. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated GI

the induction of both ABCB1 and ABCC1 by FasL in
SW480 (Figure 2D), DLD1 (Figure 2E) and AGS cells
(Figure 2F). It has been shown that P-gp is responsible
for the resistance of cells to chemotherapy drug SN-38,
an active metabolite of irinotecan. We next knocked
down P-gp by lentiviral shRNA and treated with SN-38
in GI cancer cells. P-gp shRNA significantly reduced
FasL-induced chemoresistance in SW480 (Figure 2G),
DLD1 (Figure 2H) and AGS cells (Figure 2I). Moreover,
compared to control lentiviral shRNA, ABCB1 lentiviral
shRNA significantly increased the accumulation of
rhodamine 123, a substrate of P-gp, following treatment
with FasL in GI cancer cells (Supplementary information,
Figures S1A, S1B and S1C, S1D, S1E and S1F). Besides
ABCB1 lentiviral shRNA, Tariquidar, a highly selective
and potent non-competitive inhibitor of P-gp, was also
utilized in SN-38 cell viability assay and rhodamine 123
efflux assay. Similar results as use of ABCB1 lentiviral
shRNA were obtained in both assays (data not shown).
Taken together, these results indicate that P-gp is a key
factor for FasL-induced chemoresistance.
We next explored the relationship between
Fas signaling and P-gp expression level in GI cancer
tissues. We detected the mRNA and protein levels
of FasL and P-gp by qRT-PCR, immunoblot and
immunohistochemistry in fresh GI precancerous and
cancer samples. The mRNA levels of FasL and P-gp
showed a gradual upregulation in precancerous samples
but a sharp increase in various stages of CRC (Figures 2J
and 2L) and GC (Figures 2K and 2M). In consistence,
immunohistochemistry analysis showed a gradual
increase of of both FasL and P-gp proteins in CRC
(Figure 3A) and GC (Figure 3B), with the highest
expression of FasL and P-gp in the advanced stage
D in CRC and stage IV in GC. Similar patterns
of the alteration of the protein levels of both FasL
and P-gp in CRC (Figure 3C) and GC (Figure 3D)
were also revealed by immunoblots (Supplementary
information, Figures S2A, S2B, S2C, S2D, Tables S5
and S6). Most importantly, a positive correlation between
FasL and P-gp was noted in both mRNA and protein levels
(Supplementary information, Tables S3, S4, S7 and S8).

If combining FasL and P-gp according to rank by the
immunohistochemistry, patients with higher expression
(++/+++) of both molecules showed worse prognosis than
patients with lower expression (-/+) in CRC (Figure 3E)
and GC (Figure 3F). Altogether, these data imply that
Fas signaling may promote P-gp expression in GI cancer
in vivo.

β-catenin promotes P-gp expression by binding
with P-gp promoter
FasL-induced EMT is accompanied with the
activation of AP-1 complex and β-catenin [14, 15].
Moreover, there are several binding sites for both AP-1
complex and β-catenin in P-gp gene promoter[16,
17]. These facts led us to hypothesize that FasL
may promote the gene expression of P-gp via AP-1
complex and/or β-catenin. To test this proposal,
we downregulated c-Jun, c-Fos and β-catenin by
shRNA in GI cancer cells and checked P-gp levels
in the presence or absence of FasL. We found that
knockdown of β-catenin but not AP-1 significantly
inhibited FasL-induced upregulation of both the mRNA
and protein levels of P-gp in SW480 (Figure 4A),
DLD1 (Figure 4B) and AGS cells (Figure 4C). In
support of these results, β-catenin shRNA significantly
abolished FasL-induced resistance to SN-38 in
SW480 (Figure 4D), DLD1 (Figure 4E) and AGS cells
(Figure 4F). Moreover, in the luciferase reporter assays,
FasL significantly induced the activity of P-gp promoter,
which was apparently inhibited by β-catenin but not
control shRNA constructs. In addition, inhibition of the
transcriptional activity of β-catenin/TCF by quercetin
also significantly abolished the induction of the activity
of P-gp promoter by FasL in SW480 (Figure 4G), DLD1
(Figure 4H) and AGS cells (Figure 4I). These results
clearly demonstrated that β-catenin is responsible for
FasL-mediated upregulation of the P-gp. Following
mutating the 5 predicted binding sites for β-catenin
on P-gp promoter, we found that the first one next to
the transcription starting site (TTS) played the most
important role in the induction of P-gp expression by

FasL (Figures 4J, 4K and 4L). Further ChIP assay
demonstrated that FasL promoted the binding of β-catenin
to the first binding site next to TTS in P-gp promoter,
which was abolished by either quercetin or β-catenin but
not control shRNA (Figures 4M, 4N and 4O).

by quercetin significantly but not completely abolished
the induction of P-gp by FasL, suggesting that there is
alternative mechanism by which Fas signaling promotes
the expression of P-gp. Recently, several miRNAs
including miR-508-5p [18], miR-451 [19], miR-145
[20], miR-298 [21], miR-1253 [21], and miR-338 [21],
have been proposed to target the P-gp mRNA 3′UTR and
inhibit its translation. We wonder if FasL also increase
the level of P-gp by altering the expression of miRNAs
that target P-gp. For this, we detected the expression of
these miRNAs after FasL treatment in GI cancer cells by
qRT-PCR. Among these miRNAs, we found that only miR145 was downregulated and dependent on FasL-induced
ERK1/2 MAPK activation (Figures 6A, 6B and 6C).
Ectopic overexpression of miR-145 inhibited P-gp 3′UTR
luciferase activity and prevented FasL-induced increase of
P-gp 3′UTR reporter activity. Furthermore, overexpression
of miR-145 reduced the protein expression of P-gp as well
as inhibited FasL-induced upregulation of P-gp (Figures
6D, 6E and 6F), whereas downregulation of miR-145
promoted P-gp expression and repressed cell apoptosis
induced by SN-38 (Supplementary information, Figure
S4). Additionally, FasL-induced chemoresistance to SN38 was also inhibited by miR-145 overexpression (Figures
6G, 6H and 6I). Finally, when the miR-145 binding
site (seed sequence) in the 3′UTR region of P-gp was
mutated, miR-145 precursor or FasL stimulation couldn’t
decrease or increase the P-gp 3′UTR reporter activity
(Supplementary information, Figure S5). These results
demonstrated that P-gp is a direct target of miR-145.
To elucidate the functional linkage between miR145 and P-gp, we detected the expression of miR-145
in fresh GI precancerous and cancer samples by qRTPCR. The expression of miR-145 decreased smoothly
among precancerous samples but sharply in cancer in
various stages of CRC (Figure 6J) and GC (Figure 6K;
Supplementary information, Tables S1 and S2). Moreover,
miR-145 was negatively correlated with FasL or P-gp
according to the ranking by qRT-PCR (Supplementary
information, Tables S3 and S4). Taken together, these
data revealed that Fas signaling induces P-gp expression
partially through downregulation of miR-145 expression
in GI cancer both in vivo and in vitro.

The Fas- ERK1/2-GSK3β- β-catenin signaling
axis controls the gene expression of P-gp
β-catenin is negatively controlled by GSK3β, which
can be inhibited by ERK1/2 MAPK. In our previous
study [14], we showed that the nuclear expression and
transcriptional activity of β-catenin were increased by
inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser 9 by FasLinduced ERK1/2 MAPK signaling. These facts suggest
that FasL promote P-gp expression via the Fas- ERK1/2GSK3β- β-catenin signaling axis. Indeed, we found that
exogenous expression of GSK-3β S9A mutant, which
can’t be inactivated by phosphorylation at Ser9, partially
prevented the FasL-induced changes of P-gp expression
(Supplementary information, Figures S3A, S3B and
S3C), chemoresistance (Supplementary information,
Figures S3D, S3E and S3F) and P-gp promoter activity
(Supplementary information, Figures S3G, S3H and S3I)
in GI cancer cells. These results indicate P-gp expression
is also controlled by GSK-3β that is inhibited by FasLinduced ERK1/2 MAPK signaling.
In order to investigate whether Fas signaling
promotes P-gp expression by upregulating nuclear
β-catenin expression in vivo, fresh GI cancer samples were
analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot.
With the progression of tumorigenesis, enhanced
nuclear staining of β-catenin was observed in both
CRC (Figure 5A) and GC (Figure 5B, Supplementary
information, Tables S5 and S6). Similarly, apparently
increased protein levels of β-catenin were detected in
the later stages of CRC (Figures 5C, Supplementary
information, Figure S2E) and GC (Figures 5D,
Supplementary information, Figure S2F). Most
importantly, a positive correlation between β-catenin
and FasL or P-gp was observed according to the ranking
by immunohistochemistry (Supplementary information,
Tables S7 and S8). Moreover, when β-catenin and P-gp
were combined in accordance with the ranking by the
data from immunohistochemistry, patients with higher
expression (++/+++) of both β-catenin and P-gp showed
worse prognosis than patients with lower expression
(-/+) in CRC (Figure 5E) and GC (Figure 5F). Thus, Fas
activation may promote P-gp expression at least partially
through nuclear β-catenin activity in GI cancer.

DISCUSSION
EMT process has been found to intricately associate
with increased drug resistance; yet, little is known about
the molecular mechanisms linking these two phenomena.
In this study, with comprehensive clinic analysis and
in vitro cell culture experiments, we found that the Fas
signaling promotes chemoresistance of GI cancer via
upregulating P-gp by two distinct mechanisms. Fas
signaing enhances the gene transcription of P-gp by
increasing β-catenin through ERK1/2 MAPK-GSK3β

miR-145 suppresses P-gp expression through
interaction with the 3′UTR of P-gp mRNA

signaling axis. In addition, this pathway upregulates P-gp
expression via decreasing miR-145 (Figure 6L).
Cells undergoing EMT become more mobile and
invasive [22], while invasive cancer cells are found to be
more resistant to anticancer drugs [23, 24]. Fas signaling
has been found to promotes the motility and metastasis of
GI cancer through EMT [7]. Our data demonstrate that Fas
activation leads to chemoresistance of GI cancer cells and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

depends on the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway. Accordingly, GI
cancer patients with lower expression of FasL responded
better to FOLFIRI chemotherapy than patients with higher
expression of FasL, although these results still need more
samples to verify.
Failure of cancer chemotherapy can occur
through increased efflux of chemotherapeutic agents,
leading to the reduction of intracellular drug levels

and consequent drug insensitivity [11, 12]. A wellestablished cause of multidrug resistance (MDR)
involves the increased expression of the members of ABC
transporter superfamily, many of which efflux various
chemotherapeutic compounds from cells [11, 12]. The
most extensively characterized MDR transporters include
ABCB1 (also known as MDR1 or P-gp), ABCC1 (also
known as MRP1) and ABCG2 (also known as BCRP or
MXR) [12]. P-gp expression reflects the tumour phenotype
in colorectal carcinomas in which P-gp levels correlate
with invasion into vessels [25]. P-gp is preferentially
expressed in poorly differentiated colon tumours, but
undetectable in normal colon tissue [26]. Additionally,
P-gp is overexpressed in gastric cancer and linked to poor
prognosis and MDR [27, 28]. In this study, we found that
Fas signaling could promote P-gp expression in vitro,
and a significant positive correlation between FasL and
P-gp was observed in GI cancer samples. However, P-gp
was found to correlate with GI cancer stages but not with
differentiation. These conflicting results may be due
to sample size, patient sources, and different detection
methods. Therefore, large cohort of samples from multiple
medical centers with uniform analysis methods is needed
to draw a confirmative conclusion. Additionally, Fas
signaling also promotes expression of other transporters,
such as ABCC6, which are probably involved in FasLinduced chemoresistance.
Induction of EMT leads to increased expression of
ABC transporters and drug resistance, whereas a reversal
of EMT in invasive cells results in a concomitant decrease
in ABC transporter expression and chemoresistance, thus
establishing a strong linkage between EMT and ABC
transporter expression [29]. Moreover, several ABC
transporters contain binding sites for EMT regulators
like Twist, Snail, Slug, FOXC2, and E12/E47, and at
least three of these factors, Snail, Twist, and FOXC2, can
modulate the promoter activity of ABC transporters [29].
Previously, we reported that the EMT regulators AP-1
complex and β-catenin were activated during FasLinduced EMT. Coincidently, there are several binding
sites for both AP-1 complex and β-catenin in P-gp
promoter [16,17]. FasL-induced ERK1/2 MAPK signaling
leads to inhibition of GSK3β kinase, which in turn
phosphorylates and promotes the degradation of β-catenin
via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In consistence, we
found that FasL-induced binding of β-catenin with the
P-gp promoter depends on ERK1/2 MAPK-GSK3β
signaling. Most importantly, a positive intercorrelation
among the expression of FasL, β-catenin, and P-gp was
noted in human GI cancer samples, further supporting
the results from in vitro experiments. However, FasLinduced expression of Snail and Twist during EMT [7]
seems not involved in the regulation of P-gp expression,
as knockdown of either Snail or Twist by shRNA didn’t
affect P-gp expression after FasL stimulation (data not
shown).

microRNAs (miRNAs) are small and endogenous
noncoding RNAs that can simultaneously regulate the
expression of multiple genes, primarily by binding to the 3′
untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNA and inhibiting
protein translation [30]. Important roles for miRNAs
including regulation of cancer proliferation and metastasis
have been shown in most types of cancers [31]. miRNAs
are also components of the cellular signaling circuitry that
regulate the EMT program [22]. For example, miR-200
and miR-205 promote E-cadherin expression by inhibiting
ZEB1 and ZEB2, and thereby help in maintaining the
epithelial cell phenotype [32–34]. To date, lots of miRNAs
have been proposed to target the P-gp mRNA 3′UTR and
inhibit its translation, such as miR-508-5p [18], miR451 [19], miR-145 [20], miR-298 [21], miR-1253 [21],
and miR-338 [21]. We found that FasL stimulation
downregulated miR-145 expression in an ERK1/2 MAPK
dependent manner. We further validated that P-gp is
a direct target of miR-145. Moreover, a significantly
negative correlation between miR-145 and FasL or P-gp
was found in human GI cancer samples. Similarly, miR145 expression was demonstrated significantly decreased
in breast, colon, stomach, and bladder cancers and also
involved in the progression of these cancers[35–39].
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling is
deregulated in most cancers and downregulates miR-145
expression via Ras-responsive element-binding protein
(RREB1), which directly binds and suppresses miR-145
promoter [40]. However, we didn’t found an induction
of total or nuclear RREB1 expression following FasL
treatment. Further investigation will be needed to elucidate
how Fas signaling regulates miR-145 expression.
In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that, in
addition to promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis,
Fas signaling enhances drug resistance by upregulating
the expression of ABC transporters, especially P-gp, via
increasing nuclear β-catenin through ERK1/2 MAPKGSK3β signaling axis and downregulating miR-145. Our
data provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms
behind the association between cancer metastasis and
drug resistance, and will guide the strategies targeting Fas
signaling for cancer treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
Human colorectal cancer (CRC) SW480 and DLD1
cells, and gastric cancer (GC) AGS cells were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA)
and routinely maintained as previously described [7].
Serum-free medium was used in most experiments unless
otherwise indicated. FasL was used at a concentration of
12.5 ng/ml as previously described [7]. U0126 (10 μM)
or PD98059 (10 μM) was used to inhibit ERK1/2 MAPK
signaling. Quercetin (10 μM) was used to repress the
10773

transcriptional activity of β-catenin/TCF [41]. Tariquidar
(1 μM) was used to depress the P-gp activity. All inhibitors
were added into the culture medium two hours before
FasL treatment. Detailed information for reagents and
antibodies was listed in the Supplementary Information.

who were blinded to the overall effects of chemotherapy.
The assessment of chemotherapy response evaluated
by CT was performed according to RECIST criteria:
complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable
disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) [42]. FasL
expression in human GI cancer samples was examined
by both qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Samples
with consistent results by both methods were used (CRC,
N=63; GC, N=60) while samples with inconsistent results
were excluded.

Cell transfection
Previously, two sets of shRNA constructs (β-catenin,
c-Jun, or c-Fos shRNA) were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and GeneCopoeia
(Rockville, MD), which were transduced in SW480,
DLD1 and AGS cells, respectively [14, 15]. Similar results
for experiments of this study were confirmed using these
constructs from different companies (data not shown).
ABCB1 shRNA was also purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology and GeneCopoeia, and stably transfected
in SW480, DLD1 and AGS cells. SW480, DLD1 and
AGS cells expressing the GSK-3β S9A mutant (Addgene,
Cambridge, MA), a constitutively active mutant unable
to be inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser 9, was utilized
as previously described [14]. The miR-145 or control
precursors (GeneCopoeia) were stably transfected into
SW480, DLD1 and AGS cells. Detailed information for
transfectants was listed in the Supplementary Information.
All procedures were conducted according to the
manufacturers’ protocols.

Luciferase reporter assay
The P-gp promoter reporter (GeneCopoeia) or
3′UTR miRNA target clone (GeneCopoeia), a dualreporter system with Gaussia Luciferase (GLuc) and
Secreted Alkaline Phosphatase (SEAP), was introduced
into GI cancer cells using EndofectinTM (GeneCopoeia).
The predicted miR-145 and β-catenin binding sites on P-gp
3′UTR region and promoter were mutated using Quick
Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, Santa
Clara, CA), respectively. Luciferase activity was assessed
with the Secrete-Pair™ Dual Luminescence Assay Kit
(GeneCopoeia) as previously described [14, 15].

Cell survival analysis
GI cancer cells in serum-free media were seeded
in 96-well plate (10000 cells/well) overnight. 24 hours
after treatment with FasL, chemotherapeutic agent (5-Fu:
10 μg/ml, SN-38: 2 μM, Oxaliplatin: 20 μM) was added
into the media for 48 hours. Cell survival was analyzed
by the CellTiter-Blue®Cell Viability Assay (Promega,
Madison, WI).

GI cancer specimens and follow-up
GI precancerous (Colon and rectum, N=367;
Stomach, N=419) and cancer samples (CRC, N=135;
GC, N=143) were collected from Nanfang Hospital
(Guangzhou, China). None of the patients received therapy
before the study. All tissues were examined by at least two
experienced pathologists and checked for the presence of
tumor cells. The research protocol was approved by the
Ethics Committee of Nanfang Hospital and consent was
acquired from all patients for the study. Follow-up data
was available for all patients with GI cancer. Correlation
between clinicopathologic parameters and expression of
the investigated molecules in GI cancer was shown in
Supplementary Table 1, 2, 5 and 6.

Rhodamine 123 (Rh-123) efflux assay
The transport activity of P-gp was examined by
testing the efflux of rhodamine 123 as described [43].
Briefly, cells were incubated with 2 μM of Rh-123 for
30 min at 37°C after FasL treatment for 3 days. At the
end of incubation, cells were washed 3 times with PBS to
remove free Rh-123 and kept in dye-free medium at 37°C.
The fluorescence of remaining Rh-123 inside the cells was
analyzed by Flow cytometry (BD FACS Calibur, Franklin
Lakes, NJ).

Analysis of chemotherapy response
Patients’ medical records, including endoscopy
and CT, were retrospectively reviewed from their
electronic medical history. The chemotherapy protocols
for unresectable metastatic CRC and GC patients were
FOLFIRI (5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan). Both CT and
endoscopy were systematically evaluated before and after
chemotherapy, principally after the fourth course. CT scans
were reviewed by a radiologist with a clinician blinded to
patient outcome and results whereas endoscopic images
for primary tumor were evaluated by two endoscopists

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
ChIP assay was performed with EZ-ChIP kit
(Millipore, Bedford, MA) as previously described [15].
The purified DNA was used as template and amplified
with the following primer set, which are specific for the
first β-catenin binding site in the P-gp promoter next to
transcription starting site: 5′-tgctgaagaaagaccactgca-3′ and
5′-aaacgcgcatcagctgaatc-3′.
