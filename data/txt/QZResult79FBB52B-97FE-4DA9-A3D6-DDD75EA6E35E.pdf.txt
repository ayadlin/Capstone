ABSTRACT
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are oral anti-hyperglycemic
drugs enabling effective glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Despite
DPP-4 inhibitors’ advantages, the patients’ therapeutic response varies. In this
retrospective cohort study, 171 Taiwanese patients with T2D were classified as
sensitive or resistant to treatment based on the mean change in HbA1c levels.
Using an assumption-free genome-wide association study, 45 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in the therapeutic response to DPP-4 inhibitors
(P < 1 × 10-4) were identified at or near PRKD1, CNTN3, ASK, and LOC10537792.
A SNP located within the fourth intron of PRKD1 (rs57803087) was strongly
associated with DPP-4 inhibitor response (P = 3.2 × 10-6). This is the first
pharmacogenomics study on DPP-4 inhibitor treatment for diabetes in a Taiwanese
population. Our data suggest that genes associated with β-cell function and
apoptosis are involved in the therapeutic effect of DPP-4 inhibitors, even in the
presence of additional oral anti-diabetic drugs. Our findings provide information
on how genetic variants influence drug response and may benefit the development
of personalized medicine.

INTRODUCTION

inhibitors linagliptin [16] and saxagliptin [17] have been
shown to improve glycemia and β-cell function in clinical
trials. For these reasons, DPP-4 inhibitors are expected to
improve treatment outcomes in patients with T2D.
A number of factors contribute to inter-individual
differences in anti-diabetic drug responses, including age,
sex, disease, drug and food interactions, co-morbidity,
and genetic factors. A recent meta-analysis revealed that
DPP-4 inhibitors decrease glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
levels more markedly in Asians than in non-Asians
[18], and the clinical factors underlying DPP-4 inhibitor
resistance have been examined more intensely in Asian
subjects [19–22]. Thus, genetic variations among different
ethnic groups may alter the metabolism and therapeutic
response of DPP-4 inhibitors, as previously demonstrated
by pharmacogenomic and pharmacogenetic studies [23,
24]. Accordingly, the genetic effects of several genes such
as DPP4 [25, 26], GLP1R [27, 28], and TCF7L2 [29] on
the therapeutic response of DPP-4 inhibitors in patients
with T2D have been investigated in clinical trial and casecontrol studies with a candidate gene approach. In the
present report, we used an assumption-free genome-wide
association study (GWAS) to identify the potential genes
involved in the therapeutic response to DPP-4 inhibitors
among patients with T2D in a Taiwanese population.
While this is the first pharmacogenomic study of DPP-4
inhibitor treatment for diabetes in a Taiwanese population,
the findings could provide some information on how
genetic variants influence drug response and may benefit
the development of personalized medicine.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D), also known as non-insulindependent diabetes mellitus, is a common complex disease
with an increasing prevalence worldwide. In 2000, more
than 171 million adults were diagnosed with T2D globally,
which is expected to rise by 4.4%, affecting 366 million
adults by 2030 [1].
The current treatment for T2D aims to control
blood glucose levels and prevent diabetic complications.
Nowadays, several anti-hyperglycemic drugs are available
for T2D therapy, including metformin, sulfonylureas,
thiazolidinediones (TZDs), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors,
and insulin injections [2]. However, many patients with
T2D experience initial success with anti-hyperglycemic
drugs, only to become resistant to monotherapy over time,
thus necessitating either an ancillary anti-diabetic agent
or a transition to insulin in order to restore acceptable
glycemic control. Approximately 40% of the individuals
being treated for T2D fail to reach the desired glycosylated
hemoglobin (HbA1c) target of <7%. In a study of longterm glycemic control in T2D, Kahn et al. [3] showed
accumulative incidences of monotherapy failures at 5
years, including 15% failure with rosiglitazone (a TZD),
21% metformin (a biguanide), and 34% glyburide (a
sulfonylurea). Thus, it is important to identify novel
therapies that are more effective against T2D.
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are a class
of oral hypoglycemic drugs approved by the FDA in 2006.
Mechanistically, DPP-4 inhibitors increase incretin levels
such as the levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and
glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptides (GIP).
GLP-1 and GIP are gut hormones secreted from L and
K cells in the intestine in response to food intake [4, 5].
GLP-1 and GIP augment glucose-induced insulin release
from pancreatic β-cells, suppress glucagon secretion, and
slow gastric emptying [4, 5]. Both hormones are DPP-4
target proteins and are rapidly degraded and inactivated
by proteolysis [6, 7]. Therefore, DPP-4 inhibitors,
which can slow enzymatic cleavage that prevents the
degradation of active incretins (GLP-1 and GIP), are used
to enhance incretin-induced glycemic control. They have
been proposed as potential therapeutic agents for T2D
treatment.
DPP-4 inhibitors enable effective glycemic control
with a low risk of hypoglycemia, neutral effects on body
weight, and the convenience of once-daily oral dosing,
which may improve patient adherence to therapy [8].
Several studies [9, 10] demonstrated that DPP-4 inhibitor
treatment may be associated with a reduced incidence
of cardiovascular (CV) events. Furthermore, DPP-4
inhibitors augment insulin secretion and increase β-cell
mass by stimulating β-cell differentiation and proliferation
by reducing oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress,
inflammation, and apoptosis both in vitro and in preclinical models of T2D [11–15]. Recently, the DPP-4

RESULTS
The study population consisted of 171 diabetic
patients in stage I undergoing DPP-4 inhibitor therapy for
GWAS. Four different DPP-4 inhibitors were prescribed,
including sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin, and
linagliptin. The number of patients in each drug category
was 114 (66.7%), 22 (12.9%), 23 (13.5%), and 12 (7%),
respectively. Among them, 169 patients (98.9%) used
DPP-4 inhibitors as a second treatment. Additionally,
29.8% and 64.3% of the patients were taking one or
two oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs), respectively, at the
beginning of the study, and metformin and sulfonylurea
were the two most common OADs used in the population.
Detailed demographic and clinical characteristics of these
patients are presented in Table 1. After DPP-4 inhibitor
therapy, the patients exhibited significant differences in
ΔHbA1c values, both with and without baseline HbA1c
stratification (p < 0.001; data not shown). Further analysis
revealed that the mean value of ΔHbA1c was significantly
different among patients with different baseline HbA1c
levels because patients with higher baselines (> 8%)
displayed greater treatment responses (p < 0.001) (Table
2). Therefore, patients were classified as either sensitive
or resistant based on their responses to DPP-4 inhibitor

population. In the present study, DPP-4 inhibitors served
as an add-on therapy. More than 98% of the subjects used
more than one OAD instead of DPP-4 inhibitors alone, and
the average HbA1c level was reduced by 0.95%, which
is comparable with the data from a previous report [9].
Several factors can influence the therapeutic response to
DPP-4 inhibitors as a primary or ancillary treatment [19,
30]. Baseline HbA1c values and shorter disease durations
are important predictors of the efficacy of OADs,
including DPP-4 inhibitors [8]. In our retrospective cohort
study, subjects with higher baseline HbA1c values showed
a better therapeutic response to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment.
However, no significant association with disease duration
was observed.
DPP-4 inhibitors prevent the degradation of
incretins, GLP-1 and GIP, in response to glucosedependent insulin secretion. Previous studies showed that
polymorphism in DPP4 [25, 26] and GLP1R [27, 28],
which are directly involved in the mechanism of action
of DPP-4 inhibitors, was associated with the glycemic
response to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. Appropriate
regulation of insulin secretion may also be related to DPP4 inhibitor efficacy. Our data indicate that genes associated

two pairs of significant SNPs, rs7755097/rs9376211 and

gene encoding apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)
and within an uncharacterized gene, LOC105377923,
respectively. After adjusting for BMI as a potential
confounding factor, rs57803087 on chromosome 14
continued to be the most predictive of the DPP-4 treatment
response, with the other SNPs also maintaining their
statistical significance.
Subsequently, we replicated the six most significant
SNPs from stage I in an additional 39 sensitive responders
and 39 resistant responders. None of the SNPs showed a
significant association with the DPP-4 inhibitor response.
After the GWAS (stage I) and replication (stage II) results
were combined, rs57803087, located within PRKD1,
remained significantly associated with the DPP-4 inhibitor
response (Table 4).

To our knowledge, this is the first pharmacogenomic
study of DPP-4 inhibitor treatment for T2D in a Taiwanese

with β-cell function and apoptosis may be involved in
the therapeutic effect of DPP-4 inhibitors, even when
additional OADs are used. First, rs9376211 is located
withinthe ASK1 intron region on chromosome 6. Previous
studies have shown that ASK1 variants are associated
with skeletal muscle ASK1 expression, in vivo insulin
resistance, and T2D in Pima Indians [31]. ASK1 encodes
the ASK1 protein, a member of the large mitogen-activated
protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family that
activates downstream MAPKs, c-Jun N-terminal kinase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(JNK) and p38 MAPK, and is essential for the cellular
response to various stressors. As such, ASK1 signaling
can elicit cell death, differentiation, inflammation, and
survival [32, 33]. In pancreatic β-cells, ASK1 is involved
in the oxidative stress-induced thioredoxin-interacting
protein (TXNIP)-dependent apoptosis cascade [32, 34].
Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that the
TXNIP signaling pathway is involved in inhibition of
β-cell apoptosis by GIP [35, 36]. Collectively, our data
suggest that the increase in GIP concentration mediated

Thus, patients harboring ASK1 variants, in whom GIPmediated cell protection is compromised, may be more
resistant to this form of therapy.
A second SNP (rs57803087) was located in the intron
region of the PRKD1 gene on chromosome 14. PRKD1 is
a serine/threonine kinase that controls a variety of cellular
functions, including membrane receptor signaling, Golgi
transport, mitochondrial oxidative stress responses, gene
transcription, cell morphology, motility, and adhesion [37].
Studies have demonstrated that agonists of G-proteincoupled receptor 40 (GPR40) and free fatty acid (FFA)
receptor 1 (FFAR1) are induced by β-cell insulin secretion
[38]. Additionally, PRKD1 activation contributes to the
GPR40-mediated insulin secretion from β-cells [39]. FFAinduced GPR40 activation results in the generation of diacyl
glycerol via the phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of
membrane phospholipids, PRKD1 activation, cortical actin
depolymerization, and potentiation of a second phase of
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion [39]. Moreover, Kong
et al. [40] have reported that the M3 muscarinic receptor
promotes the insulin release via receptor phosphorylation/
arrestin-dependent PRKD1 activation. Importantly, both
of these PRKD1 activation mechanisms potentiate insulin
secretion.
There are several limitations to this study. First, we
recognize that this study had low statistical power, owing
to its limited sample size. Based on the sample size (127
resistant responders vs. 122 sensitive responders after
combining the subjects from the stage I GWAS and stage
II replication) and the difference in the allele frequency
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for the revealed SNPs (range: from 13.2% to 18.7%), the
power was 63.3% to 86.5% (Table 4). The results did not
reach statistical significance after a Bonferroni correction,
and false positive results may exist. Very little is known
about the contribution of patient genetics to DPP-4
inhibitor responses. Therefore, analyses with larger sample
sizes could potentially identify additional genetic variants
to enable better predictions for personalized or stratified
medicine. Second, metformin is known to increase GLP1 secretion by intestinal L-cells. Thus, the combination
of metformin and DPP-4 inhibitor treatment may exert a
stronger effect on β-cell function [41, 42]. In the present
study, >98.8% of patients received other drug therapies
in addition to DPP-4 inhibitors. For this reason, the
therapeutic effect of single-agent DPP-4 inhibitors could
not be determined. Third, the insulin secretory capacity
decreases according to the duration of T2D [43] and could
thus be another predictor of the DPP-4 inhibitor efficacy
[8, 19, 30]. Accordingly, clinical trials have shown that
the DPP-4 inhibitors linagliptin [16] and saxagliptin [17]
better preserved β-cell function in recently diagnosed
(< 24 months) T2D patients. Similarly, the Saxagliptin
Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients
with Diabetes Mellitus (SAVOR-TIMI 53) trial showed
that saxagliptin-mediated preservation of β-cell function
was better in patients with higher homeostatic model

treatment [17]. However, the baseline β-cell function
was not measured in the present study. Thus, we cannot
exclude the effect of variations in baseline β-cell function
on the DPP-4 therapeutic response. Fourth, we were

unable to exclude the possibility of drug interactions,
which would need to be further investigated. For example,
exposure to saxagliptin and its primary metabolite may be
significantly modified when saxagliptin is co-administered
with strong specific inhibitors (ketoconazole or diltiazem)
or inducers (rifampicin) of the cytochrome P450 3A4/5
isoform [44]. Moreover, some lipid-lowering drugs such
as statins could increase the HbA1c value. Unfortunately,
the information on lipid-lowering drugs taken by the
recruited patients simultaneously with DPP-4 drugs was
not available. However, no significant differences in the
hypertension history, cardiovascular disease history,
or lipid profiles (cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density
lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein) were observed
between the responders and non-responders at enrollment;
therefore, the potential for selection bias was minimal.
In conclusion, the current study utilized a GWASbased approach to examine the pharmacogenetics of DPP4 inhibitor treatment for T2D in a Taiwanese population.
Our data indicate that genes associated with β-cell
function and apoptosis may be involved in the therapeutic
effect of DPP-4 inhibitors, even when additional OADs
are used. However, further studies are required to confirm
the association of the genes identified in this study with
the therapeutic effect of DPP-4 inhibitors using a larger,
more ethnically diverse patient population.

based on their treatment response change, determined
by ΔHbA1 (the difference in HbA1c values before and
after treatment). In each group, subjects with the ΔHbA1
values higher or lower than the mean ΔHbA1 value for the
group were defined as sensitive or resistant, respectively.
In this two-stage study, we first genotyped 83 sensitive
responders and 88 resistant responders via an exploratory
genome-wide scan (stage I, total 171 subjects). In the
replication stage, we genotyped six selected SNPs in
an additional 39 sensitive responders and 39 resistant
responders (stage II, total 78 subjects).

Genotyping and statistical analysis
Blood glucose and HbA1c levels were recorded
before and > 60 days after a DPP-4 inhibitor treatment
course. Genomic DNA from blood samples was genotyped
with an Affymetrix CHB chip using standard quality control
procedures. SNPs with the following conditions were
excluded from the analysis: (1) individuals or SNPs with a
call rate of < 95%; (2) p ≤ 0.0001 for the Hardy–Weinberg
test for control; (3) SNPs with a minor allele frequency of <
0.01; (4) samples with first-degree cryptic relationships; and
(5) samples that were potentially 9% contaminated. In total,
618,882 SNPs were included in the GWAS.
Various clinical variables were compared between
groups using χ2 tests or two independent t-tests. The
threshold p-value was set at 8.0 × 10−8 after a Bonferroni
correction for SNP numbers (n = 618,882). All statistical
analyses were conducted using the SAS statistical
software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC,
USA). p < 0.05 (two-sided) was considered significant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population identification
This was a retrospective cohort study using data
generated from a systematic chart review of diabetic
patients from our previous study population [45, 46], treated
with a consistent dosage of DPP-4 inhibitors for > 60
days. Endocrinologists performed the chart review. Cotreatment with other OADs was permitted if dosing
was maintained for 3 months before and after DPP-4
inhibitor treatment. However, no incretin analog was
allowed together with the DPP-4 inhibitors. Subjects
with type 1 diabetes or undergoing insulin therapy were
excluded from the analyses. Because DPP-4 inhibitors
are primarily excreted in the urine and could be subject to
renal function-associated effects, subjects with estimated
glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) of less than 30 mL/min
per 1.73 m2 were excluded from the study. Additionally,
patients with eGFRs between 30 and 50 mL/min per 1.73
m2, taking ≤ 50 mg of sitagliptin/vildagliptin or ≤ 2.5 mg
of saxagliptin/linagliptin, were also excluded. The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
China Medical University Hospital, and informed consent
was obtained from all participants.
The patients were first stratified according to their
baseline HbA1c values (≤ 6.99%, 7–7.99%, 8–8.99%, and
≥ 9%) into four groups. The subjects were then classified
as either sensitive or resistant to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment
