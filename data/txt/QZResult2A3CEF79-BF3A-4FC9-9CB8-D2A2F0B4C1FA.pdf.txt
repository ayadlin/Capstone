ABSTRACT
Effective treatment options for advanced salivary gland tumors are lacking. To
better understand these tumors, we report their genomic landscape. We studied
the molecular aberrations in 117 patients with salivary gland tumors that were, on
physician request, tested in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)
laboratory (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA) using next-generation sequencing
(182 or 236 genes), and analyzed by N-of-One, Inc. (Lexington, MA). There were 354
total aberrations, with 240 distinct aberrations identified in this patient population.
Only 10 individuals (8.5%) had a molecular portfolio that was identical to any other
patient (with four different portfolios amongst the ten patients).
The most common abnormalities involved the TP53 gene (36/117 [30.8% of
patients]), cyclin pathway (CCND1, CDK4/6 or CDKN2A/B) (31/117 [26.5%]) and
PI3K pathway (PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN or AKT1/3) (28/117 [23.9%]). In multivariate
analysis, statistically significant co-existing aberrations were observed as follows:
TP53 and ERBB2 (p = 0.01), cyclin pathway and MDM2 (p = 0.03), and PI3K pathway
and HRAS (p = 0.0001). We were able to identify possible cognate targeted therapies
in most of the patients (107/117 [91.5%]), including FDA-approved drugs in 80/117
[68.4%]. In conclusion, salivary gland tumors were characterized by multiple distinct
aberrations that mostly differed from patient to patient. Significant associations
between aberrations in TP53 and ERBB2, the cyclin pathway and MDM2, and HRAS
and the PI3K pathway were identified. Most patients had actionable alterations. These
results provide a framework for tailored combinations of matched therapies.

reports and retrospective series, rather than prospectively
performed clinical trials. Thus, it has been challenging to
define the role of chemotherapy in management of advanced
salivary gland tumors [6]. Systemic therapies investigated
in the past include cisplatin [7], paclitaxel [8], combination
of cisplatin plus vinorelbine [9] and the combination
of cisplatin, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [10].
Modest response rates can be achieved with cytotoxic
chemotherapy (~4% to 27%) [7–10] and no drugs are
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
specifically for salivary gland tumors.
Importantly, several possible biological targets
in salivary gland tumors have been reported: c-Kit[11]

INTRODUCTION
Malignant salivary gland tumors are an
uncommon subgroup of head and neck cancers [1–3].
The most frequent types of malignant salivary gland
tumors according to the WHO classification [1] are
mucoepidermoid carcinoma (10.0–32.7%) and adenoid
cystic carcinoma (23.3–23.8%) [4, 5].
Initial standard of care therapy of localized disease
is surgery and/or radiation therapy, whereas chemotherapy
is typically reserved for palliative treatment of local and
regional recurrence or metastatic disease [6]. Due to the
rarity of the disease, data are often derived from case

ERBB2 were found only in patients with adenocarcinoma,
NOS (7/46 patients [15.2%] [two mutations and five
amplifications]) (Table 1 and Figure 1C).
Molecular characteristics of patients with
adenocarcinoma, NOS (N = 46) were similar to those of
all salivary gland tumors (Table 1 and Figures 1A and 1C),
likely because they were the second most common
subgroup. The most common genetic aberrations among
patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma (N = 49) were
NOTCH1/2 (26.5% [13/49]) (mainly NOTCH1 (24.5%
[12/49])) and KDM6A (26.5% [13/49]). Aberrations in the
PI3K pathway represent the second most common genetic
alterations in adenoid cystic carcinoma patients (16.3%
[8/49]) (Table 1 and Figure 1B).

(positive protein expression by immunohistochemistry but
no exon 11 or 17 mutations); EGFR [12], HER2 [13, 14],
androgen, estrogen and progesterone receptor protein
expression by immunohistochemistry [15]; and PIK3CA
[16] and BRAF mutations [16]. Interestingly, salivary
duct carcinomas resemble breast cancer histologically,
and about 20 to 80% of salivary duct carcinomas are
HER2 positive by immunohistochemistry [13, 14]; in
approximately 90% of salivary duct carcinomas, androgen
receptors are positive by immunohistochemistry [17].
Although targeted therapies with imatinib [18],
gefitinib [19], cetuximab [20], trastuzumab [21] and
lapatinib [22] have generally had low response rates,
these therapies were given to unselected patients rather
than matched to individuals whose tumors harbored
cognate aberrations [18–22]. However, when patients were
selected for the presence of ERBB2/HER2 or PIK3CA
aberrations and were treated with appropriate targeting
agents (trastuzumab and lapatinib [23] or mTOR inhibitors
[24], respectively), anecdotal remarkable responses have
been described.
Given that effective treatment options are needed,
further molecular understanding of salivary gland
tumors is necessary. We therefore examined the genomic
landscape of salivary gland malignancies, as determined
by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Here we
report the most frequent aberrations, many of which could
conceivably be actionable with targeted therapies.

Number of genetic aberrations and possible
cognate targeted therapies in patients with
salivary gland tumors (Figure 2, Supplemental
Tables 1 and 2)
Of the 354 total aberrations (some aberrations
were identified in more than one case), 257 (72.6%)
were actionable, with 107/117 patients (91.5%) having
a potentially actionable abnormality. Of the 240 distinct
aberrations, 155 (64.6%) were potentially actionable. Of
these 155 actionable aberrations, 114 (47.5% [114/240])
were targetable by an FDA-approved drug (off label).
An additional 41 (17.1% [41/240]) were targetable by an
experimental drug in a clinical trial. The number of genetic
aberrations reported per patient ranged from zero to ten
with a median of three aberrations per patient (Figure 2).
The number of genetic aberrations that were actionable
ranged from zero to ten with a median of two actionable
aberrations per patient (Figure 2). Of the 107 patients
with at least one actionable aberration, 80 (74.8%) had
an aberration targetable by an FDA-approved drug and
an additional 27 (25.2%) had an aberration targetable by
an investigational drug in a clinical trial (Supplemental
Tables 1 and 2).

RESULTS
Genetic aberrations in salivary gland tumors
(Table 1, Figure 1 and Supplemental Table 1)
Among all salivary gland tumors (N = 117)
that were evaluated, 41.9% (49/117) of samples were
histologically diagnosed as adenoid cystic carcinoma. The
second most common histology was adenocarcinoma, not
otherwise specified (NOS) (39.3% [46/117]) followed by
acinic cell carcinoma (6.0% [7/117]), mucoepidermoid
carcinoma (4.3% [5/117]), salivary duct carcinoma
(3.4% [4/117]), myoepithelial carcinoma (2.6% [3/117])
and undifferentiated carcinoma (2.6% [3/117]) (Table 1).
The most common aberration among all salivary
gland tumors was in the TP53 gene (36/117 patients
[30.8%]), followed by anomalies in the cyclin pathway
(CCND1, CDK4/6 or CDKN2A/B) (observed in 26.5%
[31/117] of all salivary gland tumors). Aberrations in the
PI3K pathway (PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN or AKT) were the
third most common set of aberrations among all salivary
gland tumors (28/117 [23.9%]). Anomalies in HRAS
were seen in 11.1% (13/117) of salivary gland tumors,
including 5 of 46 patients (10.9%) with adenocarcinoma,
NOS (Table 1 and Figures 1A and 1C). Aberrations in

As mentioned, there were 240 distinct molecular
alterations. Only ten patients (8.5% [10/117]) had
a molecular portfolio identical to at least one other
patient (Supplemental Table 1, Case No. 13 and 1297

No. 1523 and 1777 [both adenocarcinoma, not otherwise

DISCUSSION
Malignant salivary gland tumors are an uncommon
type of cancer of the head and neck [1, 2]. In general,
salivary gland tumors have shown low response rates to
chemotherapies [7–10] or to molecularly targeted therapies
that are administered without molecular matching [11–13,
15, 16, 18–22]. Thus, therapeutic options for salivary
gland tumors are limited. However, anecdotal reports
have described remarkable responses in salivary tumors
when genetic aberrations and therapies were matched:
trastuzumab and lapatinib for Her2-aberrant salivary
tumors [23] or mTOR inhibitors for PIK3CA-aberrant
neoplasms [24]. We therefore investigated the genomic
landscape of salivary gland tumors by targeted nextgeneration sequencing.
In our current study of 117 patients suffering from
salivary gland tumors, the most common histological
diagnosis was adenoid cystic carcinoma (41.9% [49/117]).
The second most common histology was adenocarcinoma,
NOS (39.3% [46/117]) followed by acinic cell carcinoma
(6.0% [7/117]) and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (4.3%
[5/117]) (Table 1).
It is unclear why the frequency of histological
subtypes of salivary gland tumors seen in this study is
different from the previous literature; mucoepidermoid
carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma are the two most
common subtypes [4, 5] and adenocarcinoma, NOS has
been reported to be relatively low in frequency (1.8 - 3.3%)
[4, 5]. However it is plausible that aggressive histological
subtypes of malignant salivary gland tumors are more
frequently referred for next-generation sequencing in order
to pursue possible treatment options. Indeed, Wahlberg
et al reported that patients with adenocarcinoma, NOS had
worse 10-year survival compared to mucoepidermoid and
adenoid cystic carcinoma (10-year survival 55%, 80%,
and 74% respectively) [3].
The most common genetic aberration among
117 patients with salivary gland tumors was TP53 mutation
(36/117 [30.8%]) (Table 1, Figure 1A and Supplemental
Table 1). Our current study is in agreement with previous
reports demonstrating that 22–60% of salivary gland
tumors harbor a TP53 mutation [25–27]. Although little
is known about the role of TP53 in the pathogenesis

Association between aberrant cyclin pathway
(CCND1, CDK4/6 or CDKN2A/B) and co-existing
molecular aberrations. Univariate and
multivariate analysis (Table 3)
In univariate analysis, there was a negative
association between aberrant cyclin pathway and aberrant
NOTCH1/2 (2 of 20 patients [10.0%] with aberrant
NOTCH1/2 had an abnormality in cyclin pathway;
29 of 97 patients [29.9%] with normal NOTCH1/2 had
an abnormality in cyclin pathway; p = 0.09 [trend]).
Presence of an MDM2 aberration was associated with
abnormalities in cyclin pathway by univariate analysis
(6 of 10 patients [60.0%] with aberrant MDM2 had
an abnormality in cyclin pathway; 25 of 107 patients
[23.4%] with normal MDM2 had an abnormality in cyclin
pathway; p = 0.02).
After multivariate analysis, aberrations in MDM2
remain positively associated with an aberrant cyclin
pathway (p = 0.03) (Table 3).

Association between PI3K pathway abnormalities
(PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT1/3 aberrations) and
co-existing molecular aberrations. Univariate
and multivariate analysis (Table 4)
In univariate analysis, aberrations in HRAS were
associated with PI3K pathway abnormalities (10 of
13 patients [76.9%] with aberrant HRAS had a PI3K
pathway abnormality; 18 of 104 patients [17.3%]
with normal HRAS had a PI3K pathway abnormality;
p = < 0.0001).
A trend toward an association between aberrations
in NF1 and PI3K pathway abnormalities was noted (4 of
8 patients [50.0%] with aberrant NF1 had an abnormality
in the PI3K pathway; 24 of 109 patients [22.0%] with
normal NF1 had an abnormality in PI3K pathway;
p = 0.09 [trend]). As mentioned earlier (Table 2), there
was a positive correlation between PI3K pathway

cyclin pathway will likely lead to suppression of TP53
(TP53 is negatively regulated by MDM2) [40]. Thus,
for patients with co-aberrations in MDM2 and the CDK
pathway, inhibition of both MDM2 [41] and the cyclin
pathway [33] may be required to effectively target this
pathway.
Importantly, aberrations in the PI3K pathway
(PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN or AKT) were commonly seen in
salivary gland tumors (28/117 [23.9%]). Of interest, there
was a statistically significant association between aberrant
HRAS and PI3K pathway abnormalities (10/13 [76.9%]
versus 18/104 [17.3%]; p = 0.0001 after multivariate
analysis, Table 4). PI3K and RAS are key regulators of
cell motility and chemotaxis and they influence each
other’s activities by direct and indirect feedback processes
[42]. Janku et al have also previously shown that MAP
(mitogen-activated protein) kinase-related genes are more
frequently aberrant in the presence PIK3CA mutations
than when PIK3CA is normal [43]. Since mutation in
HRAS is also capable of activating the MAP kinase
signaling pathway, merely blocking the PI3K pathway
will likely not be sufficient. Although the role of PIK3CA
mutation as a predictive biomarker for everolimus
or PI3K inhibitor response is controversial [44], the
PI3K pathway is potentially targetable with the mTOR
inhibitor everolimus [45]. Adding MEK inhibitors such as
trametanib [46] in order to block signals downstream of
HRAS may be required in patients who have anomalies in
the PI3K pathway.
Our results in adenoid cystic carcinoma (Figure 1B)
are in agreement with previously reported literature where
several aberrations including NOTCH1/2 (3/24 [12.5%]),
KDM6A (2/24 [8.3%]), CDKN2A (1/24 [4.2%]) and
PIK3CA (1/24 [4.2%]) were identified by whole exome
sequencing of 24 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma
[47]. Both studies had small numbers of patients, reflecting
the rarity of this tumor.
Interestingly, 107/117 patients (91.5%) had
potentially actionable aberrations (Supplemental Table 1).
The number of actionable genes affected per patient ranged
between zero and ten, with a median of two per patient
(Figure 2). Of the 240 distinct aberrations, 155 (64.6%)
were potentially actionable. Of these 155 actionable
aberrations, 114 were targetable by an FDA-approved
drug (off label) (representing 47.5% [114/240] of all
distinct alterations). An additional 41 (17.1% [41/240] of
all distinct alterations) were targetable by an experimental
drug in a clinical trial. (Figure 2, Supplemental Table 1
and 2). Overall, 91.5% (107/117) of patients had at least
one potentially actionable anomaly. As there are no FDAapproved targeted therapies for salivary gland tumors and
most conventional chemotherapy has been shown to be
associated with poor clinical outcomes (median overall
survival [OS]: 4 to 21 months in the advanced setting)
[7–10], targeted therapies based on molecular profiling
merit investigation [48].

of salivary gland tumors, it has been suggested that
alteration in this gene is involved in later stages of tumor
progression [28]. Of interest, Said et al showed that
bevacizumab-containing regimens were associated with
longer progression-free survival (PFS) when compared
to non-bevacizumab-containing regimens in patients
with TP53-mutated advanced solid tumors (median 11.0
versus 4.0 months; PFS was not increased in patients
with wild-type TP53 on bevacizumab-based treatment
[median = 5 months, p < 0.0001]) [29]. These results
require validation in a prospective study. Of interest, in our
study, aberrations in ERBB2 were associated with TP53
anomalies after multivariate analysis (p = 0.01) (Table 2).
Anomalies in ERBB2 may be targeted with lapatinib or
trastuzumab [23, 30].
The second most common aberrations involved the
cyclin pathway (CCND1, CDK4/6 or CDKN2A/B), which
was abnormal in 26.5% of patients (31/117) with salivary
gland tumors. Aberrations in the cyclin D-cyclin-dependent
kinase pathway that regulates the cell cycle restriction
point is a common feature of human cancer, contributing to
tumor proliferation, genomic instability and chromosomal
instability [31–33]. This pathway can be altered through
multiple mechanisms including increased signaling
through CDK4 and CDK6 amplification, overexpression of
cyclin D1, and loss of inhibitors including CDKN2A (p16)
and/or CDKN2B (p15) [34–37]. Mutation or loss of RB1
(Rb; retinoblastoma) also alters this pathway, but renders
tumors resistant to CDK inhibitors. Only three patients
in our series had RB1 mutations. According to Etges
et al [38], malignant salivary gland tumors expressed the
cyclin pathway differently from normal salivary gland
when assessed by immunohistochemistry. They reported
that expression of cyclin D1, CDK4 and CDKN2A were
significantly higher in malignant salivary gland tumors
(including adenoid cystic carcinoma and mucoepidermoid
carcinoma) when compared to normal salivary gland.
Meanwhile protein expression level of Rb was lower in
malignant salivary gland tumors when compared to normal
salivary gland [38]. Although it is unclear why CDKN2A
protein expression was higher in malignant salivary
gland tumors in this study, it is possible that the cyclin
pathway is involved in tumorigenesis of salivary gland
cancers. Regarding therapeutic implications, the cyclin
pathway is possibly targetable with CDK4/6 inhibitors
such as with palbociclib [33] and further investigation is
warranted. Of interest, MDM2 amplifications were more
likely to be associated with abnormalities in the cyclin
pathway (6/10 [60.0%] versus 25/107 [23.4%]; p = 0.03
after multivariate analysis) (Table 3). Similarly, Moller
et al reported that five out of seven patients with diffuse
large B cell lymphomas had co-aberrations in MDM2
(amplification) and CDKN2A (deletion), when assessed
by immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction
respectively [39]. Since MDM2 is negatively regulated
by CDKN2A, MDM2 amplification and aberrations in the

Our current study has some limitations. First, it
was performed retrospectively with a relatively limited
number of patients, especially in certain subgroups of
salivary gland tumors. The small numbers preclude
definitive statistical conclusions in some areas. Second,
multiple comparisons could result in overcalling the
implications of positive p values. Third, we included
heterogeneous salivary gland tumors. Fourth, molecular
analysis was performed on archival tumor tissue, which
was obtained at a different time points in relationship to
the clinical history. Lastly, lumping the common pathway
abnormalities together such as cyclin pathway (CCND1,
CDK4/6 or CDKN2A/B) and PI3K pathway (PIK3CA,
PIK3R1, PTEN or AKT1/3) aberrations may be misleading
since different mutations can lead to diverse functional
consequences. However, despite these limitations, this
genomic characterization of salivary gland tumors has
uncovered some interesting and clinically relevant results.
In conclusion, our 117 patients with salivary
gland malignancies harbored 354 alterations
(median = 3 per patient), 240 of which were distinct
aberrations. The most common aberrations in patients
with salivary gland tumors were in the TP53 gene,
followed by alterations in the cyclin pathway and the
PI3K pathway (PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN or AKT)
(Table 1 and Figure 1A). Interestingly, in multivariate
analysis, there was a significant independent association
between alterations in the TP53 and ERBB2 genes
(p = 0.01) (Table 2), cyclin pathway and the MDM2
gene (p = 0.03) (Table 3), and between HRAS and
the PI3K pathway (p = 0.0001) (Table 4), suggesting
that dual targeting with cognate inhibitors may be
necessary to overcome resistance. The vast majority of
patients (91.5%) had at least one aberration that was
potentially targetable by an FDA-approved drug or an
investigational agent in a clinical trial. Indeed, of the
240 distinct aberrations, 155 (64.6%) were potentially
actionable. These observations suggest that matching
patients with appropriately targeted agents is feasible
and warrants study. However, only 10 of 117 patients
(8.5%) had a molecular portfolio identical to at least
one other patient. The latter results are similar to those
that we reported in metastatic breast cancer, where we
recently described 131 distinct aberrations in 57 patients
with no two patients having the same molecular portfolio
[49–51]. Taken together, these observations suggest
that customized combination therapy may have the
potential to provide significant benefit for these patients.

2011 to November 2013 (N = 117). We retrospectively
reviewed the histological types of salivary gland tumors
and associated genetic aberrations. Here, we report on the
prevalence and frequencies of these aberrations in salivary
gland tumors.

Tissue samples and mutational analysis
Available tissues from diagnostic and therapeutic
procedures were used to assess molecular aberrations.
Samples from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue
were sent for targeted NGS at Foundation Medicine
(Cambridge, MA). The test sequences the entire coding
sequence of 182, or more recently 236, cancer-related
genes plus 47 introns from 19 genes often rearranged
or altered in cancer to an average depth-of-coverage
of greater than 250X (http://foundationone.com/docs/
FoundationOne_tech-info-and-overview.pdf).
This method of sequencing allows for detection
of copy number alterations, gene rearrangements, and
somatic mutations with 99% specificity and >99%
sensitivity for base substitutions at ≥5 mutant allele
frequency and >95% sensitivity for copy number
alterations. Foundation Medicine uses a threshold of ≥8
copies for gene amplification. The submitting physicians
provided specification of tumor types. Next-generation
sequencing data were collected and interpreted by
N-of-One, Inc. (Lexington, MA;http://www.n-of-one.
com). Data was analyzed in accordance with UCSD
IRB guidelines. For the purpose of our analysis,
“phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway” alterations
included alterations of PIK3CA, PIK3RI, PTEN,
or AKT1/3. Similarly, “cyclin pathway” alterations
included CCND1, CDK4/6, or CDKN2A/B alterations.
We have evaluated if certain genomic aberrations were
actionable or not based on the availability of drug that is
approved or in clinical trials that targets that aberration
with low nM IC50 or an antibody that primarily targets
that abnormality.

Endpoints and statistical methods
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the
baseline patient characteristics. The Fisher’s exact test
was used to assess the association between categorical
variables in univariate analysis. Multiple logistic
regression models were used for multivariable analysis.
All tests were 2-sided. Statistical analyses were carried out
using GraphPad Prism version 6.0 (San Diego, CA, USA)
and SPSS version 22.0 (Chicago, IL, USA).
