Is nanomedicine still promising?

learn new tricks? This was promptly answered as it was
recognized that the key feature of nanoparticles is the
ability to combine more than one function by enabling the
design of agents that target, image, and destroy tumors
[13].
To further maximize the specificity towards cancer
cells, targeting nanoparticles using a receptor-ligand
system quickly attracted a lot of attention. Initially,
nanoparticles were decorated with antibodies or small
molecules that target receptors known to be overexpressed by tumors. Folate receptor-targeted liposomes
were one of the first systems to be extensively studied.
This is an ideal targeting system, since the folate receptor
is an upregulated transmembrane receptor in various
tumors [14]. While in vitro studies showed encouraging
results proving that drugs delivered via folate receptortargeted liposomes are rapidly transferred to the nuclei of
target cells [15], the in vivo performance of these agents
did not show an improved therapeutic efficacy in terms
of prolonged survival [16]. Unfortunately, numerous
studies have shown that the presence of folic acid or
other targeting ligands (e.g. antibodies) on the surface
of liposomes compromises their blood circulation time
[15, 17, 18]. This is not unexpected as long circulation
time of liposomal nanocarriers is due to a polyethylene
glycol (PEG) shielding, and when targeting ligands are
employed, they are usually conjugated on the distal end
of the PEG chain resulting in recognition by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and accelerated clearance by
the liver. Due to fact that nanoparticle extravasation is
directly proportional to their concentration in blood [19],
fewer targeted particles are able to reach the tumor site
and consequently the gains from active targeting after
extravasation into the tumor are compromised [20].
To address this major drawback, an elegant trick was
proposed by McNeeley et al. [14]. A nanoparticle system
targeting the folate receptor was developed based on a
detachable PEG mask that ‘buries’ the targeting ligands
when the nanoparticle is in circulation to maximize
passive targeting to tumors. This detachable polymer
coating can be removed by the administration of cysteine
after nanoparticle extravasation to tumor is achieved to
expose targeting ligands and promote active targeting
only to cancer cells.
However, a simpler trick is to search for targeting
moieties that are not immunogenic. Besides antibodies,
many different types of affinity ligands, including

A recent study by Mann et al. [1] published in
Oncotarget exploits the use of aptamers as a targeting
ligand to develop site-specific delivery of liposomal
nanocarriers. It has already been 17 years, since an
article titled ‘Liposomes revisited’ was published coauthored by Lasic and Papahadjopoulos [2]. In essence,
this publication marked the launch of the first success
story of nanomedicine into the clinic and the beginning
of an entire field. However, this was not an accident.
The successful development of sterically stabilized
liposomes was the product of 30 years of intensive
research, since Bangham first discovered in the early
1960s that phospholipids in water form a vesicle enclosed
in a bilayered lipid membrane [3, 4]. Not surprisingly, a
pubmed search of the word ‘liposome’ resulted in 14,858
articles published between 1965 and 1995. The focus of
these studies ranged from the in vitro particle stability to
the effect of size, lipid composition and polymer coating
of liposomes on their blood circulation, intratumoral
accumulation and anticancer activity [5-7]. Furthermore,
stable encapsulation of doxorubicin into the liposome
with negligible leakage of the drug in blood circulation
was achieved with the remote loading method against
an ammonium sulfate gradient [8]. And finally voilá:
a PEGylated unilamellar liposome composed of rigid
phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol with a diameter of
about 100 nm displayed prolonged circulation time and
as a result an increased intratumoral accumulation and
antitumor activity [6, 7].
So, what is the advantage of a long-circulating
nanoparticle over conventional chemotherapies? It was
shown that the therapeutic index of chemotherapeutics
can be substantially improved, since nanoparticle delivery
systems exploit a feature of tumor microenvironment, the
so-called ‘Enhanced Permeability and Retention’ (EPR)
effect [9]. While potent chemotherapeutic drugs are
available to oncologists, the systemic dose of these agents
is constrained by normal tissue tolerance, since these
agents are distributed within cancer and healthy tissues
in a non-specific manner. On the other hand, liposomes
improve the safety profile of drugs due to their localization
with high specificity in solid tumors while reducing offtarget delivery [10, 11]. This unique feature has led to the
development of various nanoparticle delivery systems,
which are under preclinical and clinical evaluation [12].
The question that emerges then is: Could this old dog

humanized monoclonal antibodies, peptides and
carbohydrate mimetics, have been developed [21, 22].
For example, oligopeptides identified by phase and
bacterial display have lead to the development of targeted
nanoparticles with comparable blood circulation as
their non-targeted counterparts [23]. Aptamers based on
oligonucleic acids present the most recent advancement
in the search for high affinity and specificity ligands with
improved pharmacokinetics and serum stability. Aptamers
have been shown to mimic protein-binding molecules,
and yet exhibit high binding affinity and selectivity [24].
For example, Pegaptanib is a vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)-specific aptamer that binds to human
VEGF with KD of 0.14 nM [25]. In contrast, affinity of
VEGF neutralizing antibodies that block human VEGF
binding to VEGFR-2 is about 0.4 nM [26]. Considering
the affinity of peptides, a family of VEGF-binding
peptides can bind to the VEGF receptor with KD ranging
from 0.14- 10 µM [27, 28]. Thus, the affinity of aptamers
is very high and comparable to that of antibodies.
The study by Mann et al. [1] demonstrates the
successful design of an active targeting liposomal
system based on an aptamer ligand. They identified a
thioated oligonucleotide aptamer (thio-aptamer) that
binds E-selectin expressed on endothelial cells with high
affinity and specificity. Liposomes decorated with the
thio-aptamer on the outer surface exhibited (1) prolonged
blood circulation that was comparable to the non-targeted
formulation and (2) binding to tumor vasculature with
high specificity. Thus, this work demonstrates that
aptamers are an attractive alternative over antibody or
peptide ligands based on their biological and chemical
properties, such as small size, high affinity binding,
selectivity, low immunogenicity, slow degradation
kinetics, and a relatively low cost production process
[24, 29, 30]. Aptamers are particularly well suited for
nanotechnology applications, because they can be readily
modified with functional groups that facilitate conjugation
to nanomaterials [29].
In conclusion, studies like this show that
nanomedicine has grown from an ‘exotic’ research area
to a mainstream scientific field, which is governed by
its own distinctive principles in terms of intravascular,
transvascular and interstitial transport [31, 32]. Besides
exploiting the multifunctionality of nanotechnology
to develop targeting therapeutic, imaging and multicomponent agents, the engineerability of nanoparticles
has led to nanostructures with various shapes [33, 34] and
new properties [35-37]. Therefore, it can be envisioned
that the multifunctional and engineerable nature of
nanotechnology can potentially facilitate agents that
overcome the tumor biobarriers limiting the systemic
delivery of active compounds.
