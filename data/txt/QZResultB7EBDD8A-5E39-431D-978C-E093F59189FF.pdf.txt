ABSTRACT
We previously reported the tumor suppressor function of Zinc-fingers and
homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Other studies indicate
the association of increased ZHX2 expression with improved response to high dose
chemotherapy in multiple myeloma. Here, we aim to test whether increased ZHX2
levels in HCC cells repress multidrug resistance 1(MDR1) expression resulting in
increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. We showed evidence that increased
ZHX2 levels correlated with reduced MDR1 expression and enhanced the cytotoxicity
of CDDP and ADM in different HCC cell lines. Consistently, elevated ZHX2 significantly
reduced ADM efflux in HepG2 cells and greatly increased the CDDP-mediated
suppression of liver tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining
demonstrated the inverse correlation of ZHX2 and MDR1 expression in HCC tissues.
Luciferase report assay showed that ZHX2 repressed the MDR1 promoter activity,
while knockdown of NF-YA or mutating the NF-Y binding site eliminated this ZHX2mediated repression of MDR1 transcription. Co-IP and ChIP assay further suggested
that ZHX2 interacted with NF-YA and reduced NF-Y binding to the MDR1 promoter.
Taken together, we clarify that ZHX2 represses NF-Y-mediated activation of MDR1
transcription and, in doing so, enhances the effects of chemotherapeutics in HCC cells
both in vitro and in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

including the commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs
cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP)]
and Adriamycin (ADM)[4-6] . Strategies targeting
MDR1 have been recognized as a potential method to
restore chemotherapeutic sensitivity of cancer cells,
however, strategies have had minimal clinical benefit
[3, 7]. Therefore, understanding the regulation of MDR1
expression in HCC is essential to develop more effective
treatments.
Previous studies have identified a number of
transcription factors binding sites in MDR1 promoter.
A conserved CCAAT element (Y-box), located between
-82 to -73 in the human MDR1 promoter is absolutely
required for basal and inducible expression of the human

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
common cancers worldwide with high mortality, and poor
prognosis. Although a large number of therapeutic agents
have been evaluated for the treatment of HCC, most
have been ineffective due to the high chemoresistance,
especially the multidrug resistance (MDR) of liver cancer
cells [1, 2]. Overexpression of multidrug resistance
protein 1(MDR1, also known as p-glycoprotein), an ATPdependent pump, causes the efflux of various hydrophobic
compounds and xenobiotics leading to MDR [3].
Accumulated data confirm the important role of MDR1 in
the resistance of HCC cells against different chemodrugs,

MDR1 gene [8, 9].The nuclear protein NF-Y, a complex
consisting of A, B, and C subunits, recognizes the Y-box
sequences and orchestrates MDR1 promoter activation [9,
10]. The identification of NF-Y as a central mediator of
MDR1 activation makes it an attractive molecular target
for manipulating the MDR phenotype and therapeutic
intervention.
The Zinc-Fingers and Homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2) gene
is a member of a small gene family that also includes
ZHX1 and ZHX3 [11]. Two-hybrid studies indicate that
ZHX2 can form homodimers as well as heterodimers
with other ZHX family members and with NF-YA [12].
Consistent with these data, ZHX2 regulates the NF-YAdependent genes cdc25C and Hexokinase II (HKII) and has
been implicated in cell cycle control [12, 13]. A potential
role for ZHX2 in HCC came from studies showing
that ZHX2 represses expression of alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP), glypican-3 (GPC3) and H19, three genes that
are frequently activated in HCC [14, 15]. We recently
demonstrated that ZHX2 overexpression leads to G1 arrest
and down-regulation of cyclin A and cyclin E expression
in HCC cell lines [16]. Altered ZHX2 expression has been
reported in hepatic and hematological malignancies [1719]. Interestingly, high ZHX2 expression is significantly
associated with an improved response and longer survival
after high dose-chemotherapy in patients with multiple
myeloma [17], suggesting that ZHX2 might influence drug
resistance in cancer cells.
Based on the function of ZHX2 as a transcriptional
repressor and its known interaction with NF-YA, we
hypothesized that ZHX2 might inhibit MDR1 expression
in liver cancer cells, resulting in reduced efflux of
chemotherapeutic drugs and subsequent increased
sensitivity to these agents. To test this, the correlation
of ZHX2 and MDR1 expression was evaluated in HCC
tissues. Then ZHX2 levels were experimentally increased
or decreased in several liver cancer cell lines, followed
by treatment with CDDP and ADM. Our results indicate
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that higher ZHX2 levels reduced MDR1 expression
and decreased drugs efflux in all HCC lines tested.
Consistently, ZHX2 significantly enhanced the sensitivity
of HCC cells to chemotherapeutic drugs both in vitro
and in vivo. Taken together, our data identify MDR1 as
a new target of the tumor suppressor ZHX2 and suggest
that ZHX2 maybe a novel target for the treatment of liver
cancer.

RESULTS
The expression level of ZHX2 in HCC tissues
negatively correlates with that of MDR1
We first evaluated the correlation of ZHX2 and
MDR1 expression in HCC tissues. To address that, thirty
HCC samples were involved to do immunohistochemical
staining with antibodies against ZHX2 and MDR1.
Consistent with our previous study [16], nucleic ZHX2
could be detected in less than 35% (9/30) involved HCC
cases (Table 1). Moreover, MDR1 expression in HCC
tissue sections with nucleic ZHX2 was comparatively
lower than that in HCC tissue sections without nucleic
ZHX2 (Figure 1). Analysis results of Chi-square test
and non-parametric test further confirmed the reverse
correlation of nucleic ZHX2 with MDR1 in HCC (Table
1). Both the positive percentage (score of 4–12) and
the expression intensity of nuclear ZHX2 (displayed as
median ± SD) were significantly lower in MDR1-positive
staining samples (score of 4–12) than that in MDR1negative staining samples (p < 0.05). These indicated
that reduced nuclear ZHX2 level might be responsible for
enhanced MDR1 expression in HCC.

ZHX2 decreases MDR1 expression and reduces
drug efflux from HCC cells

cells.

MDR1 is a well-known ATP-dependent drug efflux
pump. To evaluate the effect of ZHX2 on regulating the
MDR1 transporter activity, HepG2 cells were transfected
with pEGFP-ZHX2 and then treated with ADM, which
emits a natural red fluorescence. EGFP-ZHX2 expression
and ADM autofluorescence intensity were detected by
fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Figure 2C, red
fluorescence was higher in EGFP-ZHX2 expressing cells
than untransfected cells after ADM treatment, indicating
greater ADM accumulation in EGFP-ZHX2 transfected
cells. Enhanced ADM accumulation in EGFP-ZHX2
expressing cells was further confirmed by flow cytometry.
The red MFI in EGFP-positive cells was significantly
higher than that in EGFP-negative cells 4 hours after
ADM treatment (Figure 2D, left panel). The red MFI in
EGFP-positive cells remained higher than EGFP-negative
cells 2 hours after ADM withdraw (Figure 2D, right
panel), suggesting enhanced ADM retention in EGFPZHX2 overexpressing cells. Consistently, EGFP-ZHX2
positive cells exhibited a decreased ADM releasing index
compared with EGFP-ZHX2 negative cells (Figure 2E).
Taken together, these data suggest that ZHX2 suppresses
MDR1 expression and decreases drug efflux, resulting in
increased intracellular ADM levels.

In order to further confirm the negative regulation
of ZHX2 on MDR1 in HCC, we then did in vitro studies.
ZHX2 and MDR1 mRNA levels were compared in several
liver cancer cell lines. RT-PCR analysis showed an inverse
correlation between MDR1 and ZHX2 expression: cells
with higher MDR1 mRNA levels (HepG2 and HepG2.2.15
cells) had lower ZHX2 mRNA levels whereas those with
lower MDR1 (SMMC7721 cells) had higher ZHX2 (Figure
S1A). Interestingly, ZHX2 expression level correlated with
CDDP sensitivity in HCC cells (Figure S1B), indicating
that ZHX2 closely correlates with MDR1 expression and
chemotherapy sensitivity of HCC cells. To explore further
the relationship between these two genes, ZHX2 was
overexpressed or knocked down by transient transfection.
As shown in Figure 2A, ZHX2 overexpression led to
decreased MDR1 mRNA levels in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15
cells, whereas ZHX2 knockdown with two different
siRNAs (ZHX2-1674, ZHX2-2360) resulted in elevated
MDR1 mRNA levels in SMMC7721 cells. This difference
was also seen at the protein level as determined by western
blot (Figure 2B and Figure S2). These data support the
possibility that ZHX2 represses MDR1 expression in HCC

Higher ZHX2 expression increases the cytotoxicity
of chemotherapeutic drugs

increasing drug-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells.

ZHX2 overexpression enhances CDDP-mediated
inhibition of HCC growth in nude mice

The ability of ZHX2 to repress MDR1 led us to
consider whether elevated ZHX2 levels would increase
drug sensitivity in HCC cells. To test this, the cytotoxicity
index of CDDP or ADM was determined in ZHX2overexpressing cells or ZHX2-knockdown cells. In ZHX2overexpressing cell lines (HepG2 and HepG2.2.15), the
cytotoxicity index increased significantly after treatment
with both CDDP and ADM (Figure 3A) compared to
pcDNA3.0-transfected cells treated with these drugs. In
accordance, knock-down of ZHX2 in SMMC7721 cells
decreased the cytotoxicity index of both CDDP and
ADM (Figure 3B). This is further supported by IC50 assay
measured with increasing amounts of CDDP or ADM in
different cell populations (Figure 3C and D). These data
indicate that increased ZHX2 levels result in increased
sensitivity of HCC cells to these chemotherapeutic drugs.

In order to detect whether ZHX2 and CDDP could
cooperate to inhibit tumor growth in vivo, HepG2.2.15
xenograft tumors were treated with CDDP and/or plasmid
DNA (pcDNA3.0 or pcZHX2). As seen in previous studies
[16], either CDDP treatment or ZHX2 overexpression
alone inhibited xenograft growth significantly (Figure
5A). However, the combination of pcZHX2 and CDDP
cooperatively inhibited tumor growth to a greater extent
than treatment with pcZHX2 or CDDP alone (Figure
5A). Consistent with the diminished growth curves,
tumor weights at time of sacrifice were also significantly
reduced in mice with combined treatment compared
to mice treated with pcZHX2 or CDDP alone (Figure
5B). Immunohistochemistry staining verified the ZHX2
overexpression in tumors injected with pcZHX2 (Figure
5C). TUNEL staining confirmed that ZHX2 promoted
CDDP-induced apoptosis of tumor cells (Figure 5D).
These results indicated that ZHX2 overexpression
enhances the ability of CDDP to inhibit HepG2.2.15
growth in vivo.

ZHX2 increases CDDP-induced apoptosis in
HepG2 cells
Since CDDP acts to increase apoptosis by DNA
cross-linking, we next tested whether elevated ZHX2
would enhance CDDP-mediated DNA damage and
apoptosis in HepG2 cells as judged by chromatin
condensation and nuclear fragmentation [20]. ZHX2
overexpression by itself did not increase the number
of apoptotic, sub-G1 cells compared to pcDNA3.0
transfected cells (Figure 4A). As expected, a distinct
sub-G1 peak was detected in CDDP-treated HepG2 cells.
Interestingly, ZHX2 overexpression significantly increased
the sub-G1 population after CDDP treatment, indicating
that elevated ZHX2 enhances CDDP-induced apoptosis.
This increased apoptosis was further verified by Hoechst
33258 and DAPI staining in HepG2 cells, which showed
increased chromatin condensation (Figure 4B) and flow
cytometry after staining with Annexin V and propidium
iodide (PI, Figure 4C).
To further analyze the effect of ZHX2 on CDDPinduced apoptosis, several apoptosis-related proteins
were monitored by western blot. Consistent with earlier
studies , CDDP treatment increased levels of cytoplasmic
Cytochrome C, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9
and cleaved PARP (Figure 4D). Moreover, although
ZHX2 overexpression did not alter overall levels of these
proteins, pcZHX2 transfection enhanced the CDDPinduced levels of apoptotic products (Figure 4D). This
was particularly true for caspase-9, since nearly twice
the levels of cleaved caspase-9 were detected in HepG2
cells transfected with ZHX2 and treated with CDDP
compared with cells treated with CDDP alone (Figure
4D, right panel). Collectively, these results indicate that
ZHX2 overexpression enhanced CDDP cytotoxicity by

ZHX2-mediated repression on MDR1 promoter
activity requires NF-Y
Previous studies indicate that ZHX2 functions
as a transcriptional repressor [9, 12, 13]. We therefore
tested whether ZHX2 represses MDR1 promoter activity.
Results of cotransfection and luciferase assays showed
that ZHX2 overexpression significantly decreased MDR1
promoter activity in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells (Figure
6A). Conversely, ZHX2 knock-down by siRNAs greatly
enhanced the MDR1 promoter activity in SMMC7721
cells (Figure 6B). The decrease and increase in luciferase
levels showed a dose-dependent response in cells that
were cotransfected with ZHX2 expression vectors or
ZHX2 siRNAs, respectively (Figure 6A and B).
Previous studies identified a NF-YA binding
ATTGG element (known as Y box) in the MDR1 promoter
that is important for full MDR1 promoter activity [9].
Furthermore, ZHX2 was shown to interact with the NFYA subunit and inhibit the ability of NF-Y to transactivate
target genes [9]. To examine whether ZHX2 regulates
MDR1 promoter activity via the Y box in HepG2 cells,
ZHX2 cotransfections were performed with wild-type
promoter pGL3-Mp or the pGL3-mMp in which the
ATTGG motif was mutated (Figure 6C). In contrast to
pGL3-Mp, the mutant promoter pGL3-mMp was not
repressed by ZHX2 (Figure 6D). Furthermore, ZHX2mediated repression of the MDR1 promoter was dependent
on NF-Y since this repression was no longer evident when

NF-YA was knocked down by siRNA (Figure 6E).
The transfection data described above led us to
consider whether ZHX2 bound directly to the MDR1
promoter or inhibited NF-Y activity by an indirect
mechanism. As previous report in HEK-293, Co-IP
demonstrated the interaction of ZHX2 and NF-YA
proteins in HepG2 cells (Figure 7A) [9]. To directly test
whether ZHX2 bound to the MDR1 promoter, ChIP were
performed using HepG2 cells transfected with pcZHX2HA or pcEGFP-HA and oligonucleotides specific for the
MDR1 promoter (Figure 6C). As shown in Figure 7B, a
specific PCR amplification was detected in the anti-HA
immunoprecipitation from HepG2 cells transfected with

pcZHX2-HA but not in pcEGFP-HA, indicating that
ZHX2 bound to the MDR1 promoter. Interestingly, a
relative weak PCR amplification was detected in the antiNF-YA immunoprecipitation from HepG2 cells transfected
with pcZHX2-HA than that in pcEGFP-HA (Figure 7
B and C), suggested that the presence of transfected
ZHX2 could influence the NF-YA binding to the MDR1
promoter. Taken together, these data suggest that ZHX2
interacts directly with NF-Y on the MDR1 promoter and
that this interaction inhibits NF-Y-mediated activation of
MDR1 transcription.

DISCUSSION

Here, we identified the ubiquitous transcription factor
ZHX2 as a negative regulator of MDR1 transcription.
Increased ZHX2 levels led to reduced drug efflux and
enhanced the cytotoxicity of anti-cancer drugs in HCC
cell lines. Elevated ZHX2 levels significantly enhanced
CDDP mediated suppression of liver tumor growth in vivo.
These data are consistent with previous clinical studies
demonstrating an association between ZHX2 expression
and enhanced survival of patients with multiple myeloma

It is well established that MDR1/Pgp is a drug
efflux pump responsible for the transport of a variety of
antineoplastic drugs from the cells. Elevated MDR1 is
strongly implicated in MDR and decreases the efficacy
of cancer chemotherapy [3, 21]. Inhibition of MDR1/Pgp
has been proposed as a powerful way to overcome effluxmediated chemotherapy resistance in cancer cells [3, 4].

after chemotherapy treatment [17, 22].
ZHX2 was originally identified based on its
interactions with ZHX1 and NF-Y [9]. Subsequently,
ZHX2 was found to repress the expression of genes that
are frequently upregulated in HCC, including AFP, GPC3
and H19 [11, 12]. We recently identified cyclin A and
cyclin E as ZHX2 targets [16]. Here, we added MDR1 as
a new target of ZHX2. Based on our results, we propose
that ZHX2 represses MDR1 transcription by interacting
with NF-YA that is bound to the CCAAT box in the MDR1
core promoter region. Previous studies demonstrated that
NF-Y was an important regulator of MDR1 expression
[6]. Our transient transfections confirmed the importance
of the CCAAT box (Figure 6D) and the requirement of
NF-Y (Figure 6E) for ZHX2-mediated repression. The
co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed previous
reports showing interactions between ZHX2 and NF-YA
(Figure 7A) [9]. This interaction between ZHX2 and NFYA on the MDR1 promoter was further verified by ChIP
analysis (Figure 7 B and C). Previous studies identified
NF-Y as a major component of MDR1 transcriptional
complex, termed the MDR1 “enhancesome”, which is
responsible for regulation of MDR1 transcription by a
variety of stimuli, such as UV irradiation, HDAC (histone
deacetylases) inhibitors and certain chemotherapeutics
[23-25]. Moreover, NF-Y is required for recruitment
of the histone acetyltransferase P/CAF or histone
methyltransferase specific for H3K4 MLL1(mixed lineage
leukemia 1) to the MDR1 promoter, resulting in the
transcriptional activation that is likely mediated by further
chromatin remodeling [24, 26]. Whether ZHX2 disturb
the binding of the enhancesome and the recruitment of
chromatin-modifying factors to the MDR1 promoter will
require further studies.
Our data presented here demonstrate that
ZHX2 inhibits MDR1 expression, which promotes the
intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs and
increases their cytotoxic effects in HCC. This model is
supported by ADM accumulation in HepG2 cell (Figure
2C). The combined effect of ZHX2 and CDDP in the
inhibition of tumor growth in vivo further supports the
hypothesis. CDDP is generally believed to kill cancer
cells by binding to DNA and interfering with cellular DNA
repair mechanism, which eventually cause apoptosis [27,
28]. As expected, we detected CDDP induced apoptosis in
cultured HCC cells and HepG2.2.15 cells grown in nude
mice. Although ZHX2 transfer alone did not cause obvious
apoptosis, ZHX2 overexpression significantly increased
CDDP-induced cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo
(Figure 4 and 5D). In addition, western blots showed that
combination of ZHX2 overexpression and CDDP led to
increased release of cytochrome c and enhanced cleavaged
caspase-3, caspase-9 and PARP (Figure 4D). This is
consistent with the previous report which demonstrated
the CDDP induced mitochondria-driven apoptosis in
tumor cells [29]. Although chemotherapeutic agents exert
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

their effects on tumor cells through various mechanisms,
apoptosis is likely the final pathway shared by most
chemotherapeutic agents [30, 31]. Nagel et al. found that
ZHX2 activated STAT1 signaling, which could contribute
to apoptosis [15]. This raises the potential that ZHX2
promotes chemotherapy effects by regulating apoptosis
related genes and might lead to efflux-independent
chemotherapy resistance in HCC cells.
We recently reported that ZHX2 inhibits Cyclin
A and Cyclin E expression, leading to HCC cell cycle
arrest [16]. This indicates that ZHX2 functions as a tumor
suppressor in HCC. Our data provided here indicates that
ZHX2 represses MDR1 expression and therefore enhances
the effect of chemotherapy via increased intracellular
drug concentration. This is therefore a second mechanism
by which ZHX2 influence HCC cell growth. Further
investigation using clinical specimens will be required
to determine whether abnormal ZHX2 expression in
liver tumors may be used as a potential biomarker for
predicting chemotherapeutic drug resistance. Our data
also suggest that increasing ZHX2 levels may decrease
the growth of HCC cells and increase their sensitivity to
chemotherapeutic agents. Identifying additional ZHX2
targets may also elucidate other HCC therapy targets. In
conclusion, the results provide a basis for further clinical
research in combining ZHX2 and chemotherapeutic agents
to treat liver cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, plasmids and siRNAs
The human HCC cell lines SMMC7721 were
cultured in RPMI 1640. Human hepatoma cell lines
HepG2 were cultured in minimum essential medium
(MEM) with 1mmol/L sodium pyruvate. HepG2.2.15
cells were cultured in MEM with 380 μg/ml G418
(GIBCO). Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium.
All the cells were purchased from Shanghai Institute of
Cell Biology (Chinese Academy of Sciences ,Shanghai,
China), and all the media were supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO).
ZHX2 expression vectors pcZHX2 and pEGFPZHX2 and the siRNAs against ZHX2 (ZHX2-1674,
ZHX2-2360) were described previously [16]. pcEGFPHA was constructed by cloning the EGFP-HA to the
pcDNA3.0 plasmid. The promoter regions of human
MDR1(-137 to +158, the transcription initiation site
designated as +1) was cloned into the promoterless pGL3basic vector (Promega) to prepare luciferase reporter
plasmid (pGL3-Mp). Reporter plasmid containing mutant
MDR1 promoter (pGL3-mMp) was constructed by
mutating the wild-type Y-box (ATTGG to ACTCG). The

= 3) and the number of stained cells (0% = 0; 1-25%
= 1; 26-50% = 2; 51-75% = 3; 76-100% = 4). Final
immunoreactive scores were determined by multiplying
the staining intensity by the number of stained cells, with
minimum and maximum scores of 0 and 12, respectively
[35].

siRNA against NF-YA was purchased (sc-2997, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA).

RT-PCR and Western blot
Total RNA extracted with TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) were reverse transcribed into cDNAs using a
Thermo Scientific RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis
Kit. Conventional PCR was carried out in a BioRad
Thermal Cycler with specific primers (Table S1).
Cytoplasmic extracts and whole cell extracts
were prepared as described previously [16]. 40 µg
of protein separated by SDS-PAGE were bloted with
following antibodies: anti-ZHX2 (ab56886, Abcam,
MA, USA), anti-β-actin (sc-1616-R, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), anti-MDR1(sc-55510, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and
anti-cytochrome c (4280), anti-caspase-3 (9668), anticaspase-9 (9508), anti-PARP (9532) from Cell Signal
Technology, MA, USA.

Cytotoxicity assay
To evaluate the effect of ZHX2 on the toxicity of
chemotherapeutic drugs, ZHX2-overexpressing cells
or ZHX2-knockdown cells were treated with Cisplatin
(CDDP, 20μg /ml; QiLu Pharmaceutical, Jinan, China) or
Adriamycin (ADM, 20 μg/ml; Pfizer Pharm, NY, USA)
for 24 hours. Cell viability was assayed using the Cell
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo, Shanghai, China). The
cytotoxicity index was calculated as (1 - OD450 of drugtreated cells / OD450 of untreated cells) × 100%. The
IC50 values of CDDP and ADM were calculated using
GraphPad Prism 5 (Version 5.01, GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA) [32].

In vivo xenograft tumor studies
Male Balb/c nude mice (4~6 weeks of age) were
purchased from the Animal Research Committee of
Institute of Biology and Cell Biology (Shanghai, China)
and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions
according to protocols approved by the Shandong
University Animal Care Committee. In vivo studies
were performed as described previously [16]. Briefly,
HepG2.2.15 cells xenografts were prepared and treated by
intratumoral injection of pcZHX2 (20 µg) or pcDNA3.0
(20 µg) together with CDDP (80 µg) at 3 days interval
for four times. The tumor volume and tumor weight were
estimated. Animal experiments(6 mice per group) were
repeated at least twice.

Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis
Cells transfected with pcZHX2 or pcDNA3.0 were
treated with CDDP (20µg/ml) for 24 hours. Apoptotic
cells were estimated either by Hoechst 33258 (1 µg/ml,
Promega) or DAPI (1 µg/ml, Promega) staining or flow
cytometry with the Apoptosis detection kit (BU-AP0103,
Biouniquer Technology Co, Ltd, Nanjing, China). The cell
cycle were anlayzed by flow cytometry after propidium
iodide (PI, Sigma, USA) staining. Flow cytometery
were performed with Beckman Coulter Flow Cytometer
(Miami, USA).

TUNEL assays
Detection of apoptosis in mouse tumor tissues was
carried out by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nicked labeling (TUNEL) analysis ,and
was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit , Fluorescein Roche, Cat.
No.11684795910 ).

Clinical samples and immunohistochemical
staining
To estimate the correlationship of ZHX2 and MDR1
in HCC, ZHX2 and MDR1 immunohistochemical staining
was performed in HCC tissues from 30 HCC patients

Intracelluar drug accumulation and retention
assay

Luciferase reporter assays
HCC cell lines were transfected with reporter
plasmids (0.2µg) and pcZHX2(0.4µg) or ZHX2 siRNAs
using LipofectamineTM 2000(Invitrogen). To further
explore the role of NF-YA in ZHX2 mediated control of
the MDR1 promoter, HepG2 cells were co-transfected with
reporter plasmids, NF-YA siRNA and pcZHX2. Luciferase
reporter assay was performed using Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega).

The natural red fluorescence of the chemotherapeutic
drug ADM was used to determine drug accumulation
and retention[36]. Briefly, HepG2 cells transfected with
pEGFP-ZHX2 were cultured in medium with 40µg/
ml ADM for 4 hours at 37oC. Drug accumulation in the
cells was estimated either by fluorescence microscope or
flow cytometry. For flow cytometry, cells were gated as
EGFP-positive and EGFP-negative, then red MFI of the
gated cells was used to determine drug accumulation.
To measure the drug retention, ADM treated cells were
cultured with fresh, drug-free medium for another 2 hours
allowing drug efflux from cells. The ADM releasing index
of HepG2 cells was calculated as following: releasing
index = (accumulation MFI-retention MFI)/accumulation
MFI.

Statistics
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego,
CA) was used for data analysis. Data values were
presented as the means ± SD. The statistical correlation
between the MDR1 staining levels and the ZHX2 staining
levels in tissue sections was analyzed by the Chi-square
test. Two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni posttests was applied to determine significant differences
between different treatments in xenograft tumor studies.
The Student t-test was applied to determine significant
differences between groups. In these analyses, p <0.05
were considered to statistically significant.

Co-immunoprecipitation(Co-IP)
Cell lysates from HepG2 cells transfected with
pcZHX2 were precipitated with control IgG (sc-2027,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) or NF-YA antibody (ab6558;
Abcam, Hong Kong). After incubation with protein
A/G Plus-Agarose(sc-2003, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), the
precipitates were immunobloted with anti-HA antibody
(ab9110; Abcam).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation(ChIP) assays
ChIP assays was performed with HepG2 cells
transfected with pcZHX2-HA or pcEGFP-HA as reported
[16]. Briefly, fixed cells were sonicated to shear DNA
to 200~1000 bp and immunoprecipitated using anti-HA
antibody (ab9110; Abcam), anti-NF-YA antibody (ab6558;
Abcam) or rabbit IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
