ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most malignant cancers. Conventional
therapies are limited due to the human liver being such a unique organ and easily
showing side-effects. The unclear molecular mechanisms are tough challenges for
scientists searching for new and effective anti-HCC targeting drugs. We identified that
the nuclear receptor NR4A2 is a novel oncogene in HCC progression. In this study, we
show that NR4A2 and the notch recceptor Notch1 were expressed highly in primary HCC
tissues and immortal HCC cells by using qPCR, western blot and immuno-histochemistry
assays. Both genes were observed to stimulate HCC cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis and
cell cycle arrest by using cell proliferation assays and FACS assays. We also observed
that the four notch receptor subtypes (Notch1-4) displayed different effects on HCC
cell growth. The over-expression of Notch1 by transiently transfecting the intracellular
domain of Notch1 (ICN1, Notch1 active form) increased the expression of NR4A2, with
the knockdown of Notch1 decreasing NR4A2. This indicates that NR4A2 is one of the
Notch-mediated downstream genes. Moreover, both NR4A2 and Notch1 suppressed the
expression of tumor suppressors p21 and p63. These findings support that Notch1/
NR4A2 co-regulate HCC cell functions by playing oncogenic roles and regulating the
associated downstream signaling pathways. Novel Notch1/NR4A2-mediated oncogenic
signaling may provide us a great opportunity for anti-HCC drug development.

INTRODUCTION

[3, 4] although HCC is associated strongly with hepatitis,
particularly the viral infections involved with the hepatitis
B and C viruses [5, 6]. Thus, it is a tough challenge to
develop novel anti-HCC drugs. Activated Notch signaling
is believed to be involved in HCC pathogenesis, and more
importantly, to be critical in HCC progression [7, 8]. It
may represent a potential therapeutic approach in targeting
this signaling pathway [9].
Notch signaling has been known to be highly
conserved [9, 10] and is critical in the determination of
a cell’s fate [9]. Notch signaling is involved in cancer

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most
prevalent primary liver cancer, with high mortality
worldwide and a low five-year relative survival rate
[1]. Traditional therapeutics are limited due to the toxic
side-effects on this unique organ. Currently, the kinase
inhibitor Sorafenib is the only FDA-approved drug for the
treatment of advanced HCCs [2]. There is an urgent need
to develop more effective anti-HCC drugs. However, the
HCC pathogenic molecular mechanisms remain unclear

progression by acting as either a tumor suppressor in
some types of cancers [9, 11–13] or as an oncogene in
others [8, 9, 13, 14]. In HCC tissues and immortal cancer
cells, Notch signaling is activated aberrantly [9, 15].
For instance, Notch1 and Notch3 were detected in 60%
and 78% of 60 HCC patients, respectively [16]. Another
report showed that Notch1 was observed to be activated
in over 81% of human HCC specimens compared to the
surrounding normal tissues [17], and also, Notch3 and
Notch4 were expressed highly in human HCC tissues, with
Notch3 present in 78.3% of patients and Notch4 in 68.3%
[15]. However, there is little known about the actions or
the mechanisms of Notch signaling in HCCs [9, 13].
Growing evidence shows that Notch signaling may
play an oncogenic role in HCC progression, by regulating
certain signaling pathways and their associated genes, such
as p27, p21 and myc [9]. In our previous study, the nuclear
receptor gene NR4A2 was found to be involved in Notchmediated downstream signaling pathways in cervical
cancer cells [11]. NR4A2 belongs to the NR4A subfamily
of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors [18].
These NR4A family members affect multiple cell functions
such as cell cycling, cell apoptosis and proliferation
[19–21]. They also were found related to the progression
of cancers such as cervical cancer, melanoma, bladder
cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer [18–20, 22].
However, their roles in carcinogenesis are poorly defined.
We have demonstrated that NR4A2 might act as an
oncogene in cervical cancer cells [11]. Presently, we will
investigate further the effects of Notch signaling and
NR4A2 in HCC cells.
Our preliminary studies showed that suppression
of Notch signaling could result in HCC cell proliferation
suppression, while the activation of NR4A2 increased
cell proliferation. In the present study, we investigated
further to understand the impacts of Notch signaling and
NR4A2 on HCC cell growth and their correlation in HCC
progression. We found that the activation of both Notch
and NR4A2 stimulated HCC cell proliferation and antiapoptosis. Knockdown of Notch/NR4A2 signaling could
stop HCC cell growth. These new findings support the
oncogenic functions of Notch genes and the NR4A2 gene
and may provide potential and valuable approaches for the
development of novel anti-HCC drugs via blocking the
crosstalk of Notch and NR4A2.

signaling networks. We hypothesized that Notch mediated
downstream signaling in HCC cells via regulating the
oncogenic NR4A2 gene.

The expression of Notch1 and NR4A2 in HCC
tissues
In order to better understand the correlation and
interaction of Notch1 and NR4A2, we first investigated
the expression of both genes in different HCC cells and in
normal liver cells, primary HCC tissues and the adjacent
normal liver tissues. Via western blot assay, we found that
Notch1 is highly expressed in 5 out of 7 HCC cell lines
(high in SMMC-7721, QGY-7703, HTB-52 (Sk-hep1),
Huh7 and Bel7402 cells, but rare in Hep3B and HepG2
cells) and in normal liver cells. NR4A2 was expressed
highly in all 7 HCC cell lines, but less in normal cells
(Figure 1A). We further investigated the expression of
Notch1 and NR4A2 in primary HCC tissues via qPCR
and IHC assays. The qPCR assay showed that Notch1 at
the mRNA level was increased highly in 56.2% of human
HCC tissues (54 of 96 pairs) as compared to adjacent liver
tissues, with NR4A2 being over-expressed in 46.8% (45
of 96) (data not shown). Similar results were observed at
the protein level via the IHC assay (Figure 1B). These
findings indicate that the activation of Notch and NR4A2
might be associated with HCC progression.

The activation of Notch signaling induced cell
proliferation
We hypothesized that Notch signaling may be a
key oncogene in HCC progression. Three different cell
lines including HCC HTB-52 cells, HCC HepG2 cells,
and normal liver THLE2 cells, were chosen for the study.
We found that Notch signaling activation, via transient
transfection of the Notch active forms, enhanced cell
proliferation in HCC HTB-52 cells and in normal liver
THLE2 cells, but not in HCC HepG2 cells. As shown
in Figure 2, the over-expression of the Notch active
forms of all four Notch receptors (ICN1, 2, 3 and 4),
via transient transfection in HCC HTB-52 cells, could
increase cell proliferation. The increased rates are 54.3%
(ICN1), 14.6% (ICN2), 25.4% (ICN3) and 48.8% (ICN4)
(Figure 2A). Notch activation (ICN1, 2 and 4) also was
observed to increase cell proliferation in normal THLE2
cells, but not so with ICN3. The increased rates were
70.6% (ICN1), 46.5% (ICN2), -1.4% (ICN3) and 65.0%
(ICN4) (Figure 2B). However, interestingly, we found
that the effects of Notch activation was very limited in
HCC HepG2 cells, with the ICN-induced rates being
2.3% (ICN1), 2.5% (ICN2), –1.6% (ICN3) and –8.8%
(ICN4), while t-test analysis showed no significant change
(Figure 2C). These results support that Notch signaling
may play different roles in different kinds of liver cells and
in a notch subtype-dependent manner.

RESULTS
Notch signaling is activated highly in HCC tissues,
predicting its oncogenic role [9, 15]. However, some other
reports showed suppressive effects of Notch signaling in
HCC cells [9, 12]. The controversy lead us to confirm
the role of Notch signaling in HCCs. In this study, we
investigated the expression of Notch1 in primary HCC
tissues and the role of Notch signaling in HCC cells, along
with the involvement of certain genes in Notch-mediated

cultured for 2 days without changing the medium. As
shown in Figure 3B, the percentages of visible cells were
38.6% for the control, 52.4% for ICN1 (200 ng) and 69.6%
for ICN1 (800 ng) while the apoptotic percentages of cells
apoptosis (all apoptosis and necrosis together) were 61.6%
for the control group, 47.6% for ICN1 (200 ng) and 30.4%
for ICN1 (800 ng). This supports that Notch1 activation
decreases cell apoptosis while increasing cell proliferation.

Notch signaling activation stimulated HCC cell
growth as described above. We did further cell cycle
assays on HCC HTB-52 cells and evaluated the effects of
Notch signaling activation on cell cycle progression via
over-expressing ICN1 and ICN4. The analysis showed that
both ICN1 and ICN4 induced cell cycle arrest. As seen
in Figure 3A, the percentages for the control group are
48% (Phase G1), 4% (G2) and 48% (S), with 68% (G1),
2% (G2) and 30% (S) in the ICN1 group, and 67% (G1),
2% (G2) and 31% (S) in the ICN4 group. A significant
increase in the G1 phase was observed in the ICN1 and
ICN4 groups in comparison to the control group.

The effects of Notch signaling activation on gene
expression
In our previous study, certain signaling pathways
have been shown to be involved in cell growth arrest
mediated by Notch1 signaling activation. We also
observed the effects of Notch1 on certain genes in
cervical cancer Hela cells [11]. NR4A2, as well as VPA,
modulated the expression of these genes in HCC HTB-52
cells [9]. Thus, we investigated the effects of Notch
activation on NR4A2 and certain other genes. As seen
in Figure 4A, western blot analysis shows that Notch
activation (ICN1 and ICN4) in HCC cells increased the
expression of the Notch target gene HES1 and the nuclear

of NR4A2 induced HCC HTB-52 cell proliferation,
with an increased rate of 26%, while tumor suppressor
p63 induced suppression with a decreasing rate of 23%
(Figure 5A). Further assays at the protein level by western
blot showed that NR4A2 induced a decrease in the tumor
suppressor p63, with no or little effects on p21 and HDAC4
(Figure 5B), indicating that NR4A2 may act particularly as
a p63 negative regulator in HCC cell growth.

Our previous study showed the effects of Notch1 on
certain genes such as NR4A2, p63 in cervical cancer Hela
cells [11]. We further evaluated the effects of these genes
on cell growth in HTB-52 cells. The plasmids carrying
the gene NR4A2 or p63 were transiently transfected
in HTB-52 cells and analyzed for their effects on cell
proliferation. The assay identified that over-expression

Thus, we hypothesized that VPA might affect HCC cells
via modulating Notch signaling. We evaluated the effects
of VPA on HCC HTB-52, HepG2 cells, and normal liver
THLE2 cells, along with other Notch inhibitors such as
DBZ, DAPT, and other HDAC inhibitors such as TSA and
SAHA, done at their customary concentrations (Figure 6).
VPA displayed significant suppression in HCC and
normal liver THLE2 cells in a dose-dependent manner,
with the suppressive rates using VPA at 5 mM being
57% in HTB-52 cells (Figure 6A), 35% in HepG2 cells
(Figure 6B) and 65% in THLE2 cells (Figure 6C). The two
HDAC inhibitors TSA and SAHA showed more potent
inhibitory activity in all HCC cells and in normal liver
cells. In comparison with that, the two Notch inhibitors
DBZ and DAPT had no effect in these cells (Figure 6).

and cell apoptosis. For cell cycle arrest, FACS assays
were done in the same three cell lines HTB-52, HepG2
and THLE2. In HCC HTB-52 cells, VPA, TSA and SAHA
induced growth arrest at phase G2, with the rates being
13.7% (VPA: 4 mM), 12.3% (TSA: 1 µM) and 8.8%
(SAHA: 1 µM), compared to 4% for the control. There
was little change for DAPT at 50 µM (6%) and no change
with DBZ at 50 µM (4.8%) (Table 1). In HCC HepG2
cells, these factors slightly induced a growth arrest at
phase S, with a slight increase of the rates being 15%
(VPA: 4 mM), 12.4% (TSA: 1 µM), 13.7% (SAHA:
1 µM), 12.7% (DBZ: 50 µM) and 14.1% (DAPT: 50 µM),
compared to 10.3% for the control (Table 1). However, in
normal liver THLE2 cells, these factors slightly induced
a growth arrest at phase G, with the rates being 49.7%
(VPA: 4 mM), 47.5% (TSA: 1 µM), 49.3% (SAHA:
1 µM), 47.3% (DBZ: 50 µM), and 47.4% (DAPT:
50 µM) compared to 45.5% for the controls (Table 1). We
further confirmed that the two compounds, VPA and TSA,
induced HCC HTB-52 cell apoptosis, with the percentage
of apoptosis and necro-apoptosis being 89% (VPA) and
90% (TSA), but DBZ did not (data not shown).

The effects of Notch regulators on HCC cell
morphological change

The effects of Notch regulators on Notch1 and
NR4A2

Cell morphological change is strongly related to
cell differentiation and tumor metastasis [25]. VPA was
reported to affect cell differentiation in many cancer
cells [26, 27]. We tested the effects of VPA and five other
compounds in HCC HTB-52 cells. The three compounds,
VPA, TSA and SAHA, were observed to induce HCC
HTB-52 cell morphological change, but DBZ and DAPT
did not (Figure 7). We also analyzed the effects of VPA
on the expression of the metastasis-related genes such
as MMP2, Twist and Snail. We found that MMP2 was
increased, with Twist decreased and Snail not changed
(data not shown), supporting that Notch regulators might
possibly be options for the development of anti-HCC
drugs.

As discussed above, both Notch1 and NR4A2 could
stimulate HCC cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis,
supporting their oncogenic functions in HCC cells.
Therefore, we further investigated the effects of VPA, along
with the other two molecules, TSA and DBZ, on histone
acetylation, Notch and other associated genes, particularly
NR4A2. We found that all three molecules increased the
expression of AcH4, but not H4 and HDAC4. They also
increased the expression of tumor suppressor p21 and
p63. These molecules decreased the expression of Notch1,
Notch target gene HES1and NR4A2 (Figure 4B). These
molecules affected HCC cell growth possibly via regulating
histone acetylation and Notch downstream signaling, but
they might modulate different signaling pathways.

DISCUSSION

Knockdown of Notch signaling suppressed
NR4A2 and reversed ICN1-induced cell
proliferation

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most
prevalent primary liver cancer and one of the most
malignant cancers [9, 28]. Conventional treatments have
limited anti-HCC efficacy and easily induce severe toxic
side-effects. Thus, scientists pay more attention to the
development of more effective anti-HCC targeted drugs
having less toxicity. One challenge is that the molecular
mechanisms of HCC carcinogenesis are unclear. Various
signaling pathways and associated genes have been
demonstrated to be involved in HCC progression [4, 9].
One of them is the highly conserved Notch signaling
that is extremely critical in development and cell control
[10, 29]. This signaling has been found involved widely
in the carcinogenesis process [9]. Our current studies
support that Notch signaling activation stimulates HCC
cell proliferation. Our previous studies identified the
multiple functions of Notch signaling in different types
of cancers, and supported that Notch signaling was
more diversified and complicated than expected [9, 11].
Thus, cancer type-specific strategies should be carefully
considered when developing anti-cancer drugs against
Notch signaling.

By understanding that the activation of Notch
signaling increased HCC cell growth, its inactivation
decreased growth, and with the involvement of genes
such as NR4A2, p21 and p63, we thus hypothesized that
NR4A2 functioned as an oncogene via directly involving
Notch-mediated HCC carcinogenesis and the downstream
signaling networks. In the present study, we tested to see if
the negative Notch regulator VPA could reverse the effects
of Notch signaling in HCC cells. The over-expression of
the Notch1 active form ICN1 stimulated HCC HTB-52
cell growth, but VPA could erase ICN1-induced increase
in cell growth (Figure 8A). As seen in Figure 8A, ICN1
induced an increase (29.6%). However, VPA reduced the
ICN1-induced increase to 6.8%, compared to that of the
control group. Furthermore, western blot analysis showed
that VPA could erase Notch-induced gene expression.
Shown in Figure 8B, VPA reversed an ICN1-induced
increase of NR4A2. These support that NR4A2 plays
an oncogenic role in HCC cells, with VPA acting as a
negative Notch/NR4A2 signaling regulator.

The functions and the precise molecular mechanisms
of Notch signaling are not fully clear in HCCs, and are
even controversial in different independent studies [9, 13].
However, accumulating evidence supports that Notch
signaling may be a HCC diagnostic marker and potentially
be an anti-HCC drug target [30–32]. The high signature of
Notch signaling has been observed in many HCC tissues
[15, 16, 30]. We compared the difference of Notch1
existing in primary HCC tissues and in adjacent liver
tissues and found that Notch1 is up-regulated highly in
over 50% of tumor tissues and most tested HCC cell lines,
identical to other reports [16, 31]. Further assays display
that Notch signaling activation via over-expressing Notch
active form (ICN) could stimulate growth of HCC HTB-52
and normal liver THLE2 cells with a high Notch signature.
Moreover, we found that Notch signaling worked in a
Notch subtype-dependent manner, with ICN1 and ICN4
displaying more effects in both cell lines. Notch signaling
knockdown using Notch inhibitors suppressed HCC HTB52 cell growth. We did not observe a significant effect of
Notch activation on HCC HepG2 cells with low Notch
signature. Thus, the strategy of developing anti-HCC
drugs via targeting Notch signaling needs to be carefully
evaluated [9, 13].

The evidence implicates the impacts of the nuclear
receptor NR4A family on cancer progression, although
their roles in HCCs are unknown [18, 33]. Our previous
study also showed that NR4A2 stimulated cervical cancer
cell growth [11]. Presently, we found that NR4A2 was
up-regulated in many primary HCC tissues and immortal
HCC cell lines, and co-existed with Notch1. Also, NR4A2
induced an increase in HCC cell growth just as Notch
signaling did. Further investigations at the molecular
level found out that Notch activation/inactivation
modulated the expression of NR4A2. Both Notch1 and
NR4A2 negatively co-regulated tumor suppressor p63.
NR4A2 also was recently reported to be involved in the
p53-mediated signaling networks [34]. These findings
support a correlation between Notch1 and NR4A2, both
of which may affect positively HCC progression via coregulating downstream signaling pathways, particularly by
suppressing tumor suppressors. This new discovery may
provide a potential anti-HCC approach via blocking the
Notch/NR4A2 signaling cascade.
Interventions of Notch-mediated signaling have
been applied to treating various cancers [11, 24, 35]. In our
previous study and in other reports, the HDAC inhibitor
VPA has been demonstrated able to act as a positive/

manner [9, 23]. We confirmed the oncogenic effects of
Notch signaling in HCC tissues and cells. Thus, we tested
VPA and other HDAC/Notch inhibitors for their effects
in HCC cells and their involvement in Notch/NR4A2mediated signaling pathways. Both TSA and SAHA
displayed the most potent anti-HCC efficacy. VPA also
suppressed cell growth, similar to our previous reports [24].
But the Notch inhibitors DBZ and DAPT did not show
significant effects on HCC cell growth. These compounds
are different in their precise mechanisms and functions in
HCC treatments although all of them induced acetylation
of histone 4, decreased Notch1 and NR4A2, and increased
the tumor suppressors p21 and p63. Particularly, VPA

is widely used to treat many cancers as an adjuvant in
combination with various anti-cancer agents [36, 37]. In
the present study, VPA could suppress HCC cell growth
and block Notch/NR4A2-mediated signaling. Furthermore,
VPA could erase the Notch1-induced increase in HCC cell
growth via directly knocking down Notch1-induced upregulation of NR4A2, supporting that VPA in combination
with others is potentially an anti-HCC drug by targeting
the Notch/NR4A2 signaling pathway [9, 38, 39]. Further
combination therapeutics are currently under investigation.
Conclusively, we demonstrated that the nuclear
receptor NR4A2, besides Notch1, was highly expressed
in HCC tissues and HCC cells. These two genes also play
oncogenic roles in HCC cells and may serve as predictive

significantly suppressed cell growth in all three types of HCC cells, HTB-52 (A), HCC HepG2 (B) and liver cells THLE2 (C). The dual
HDAC/Notch regulator, VPA, partly suppressed cell growth in all three cell lines as well. One-way ANOVA analysis showed the significant
suppressive effects with TSA and SAHA in each cell line, as well with the effective trends in the treatments of VPA among the serial
different concentrations. However, the significant effects of the Notch inhibitors DBZ and DAPT were not observed in these cells.

HCC oncogenic markers. Knockdown of these genes
could slow down HCC cell growth. Thus, intervention
of Notch1/NR4A2-mediated signaling may provide a
promising opportunity for the development of HCCtargeted drugs. VPA as an adjuvant agent may be an option
for a combination treatment in HCC patients.

Cell culture and transfection

RT-PCR and real-time PCR

Human cell lines HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7, HTB52 (Sk-hep-1) and THLE2 were purchased from ATCC
(American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA).
Human HCC cell lines SMMC-7721, QGY- 7703, and
BEL-7402 were obtained from the Cell Bank of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). All cells
were maintained in DMEM/MEM medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin, with incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere.
For cell transfection, 500 μl of cells (2 × 105 cells/ml)
were plated in each well of a 24-well plate. Two μl of
LipofectamineTM 2000 (Lipo-2000) and 0.8 μg of DNA
were added separately in each vial with 50 μl OptiMEM transfection medium, and combined together after
5–10 minute incubation. The DNA/Lipo2000 complexes
were incubated continuously for 20–30 minutes and then
added to each well. The transfected cells were incubated
for 48 hours and assayed for cell cycling and apoptosis, or
alternatively, in a cell proliferation assay, growth medium
was changed 4–5 hours later and cells were further
incubated for 72-hours. The experiments were done
separately in triplicate.

Total RNA was extracted from tissues and cells
with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed
as described in the protocols (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
The primers and conditions for RT-PCR analyses were as
previously described (23), with the exception of NR4A2
(Nurr1) primers (Forward: 5′-AGA GAC GCG GAG AAC
TCC TA-3′, Reverse: 5′-AGG CAT GGC TTC AGC CGA
GT-3′). PCR was regularly amplified for 35 cycles, more
or less, due to the difference in RNA abundance of these
investigated genes. Primers for real-time PCR analyses
were the same as described above. Real-time PCR was
performed by using SYBR Green PCR master mix from
QuantStudio™ 7 (Life technologies, USA). Properly
diluted cDNA was used in a 10 μl qRT-PCR, in triplicate
for each gene. β-actin was used as the internal control and
results were calculated by applying 2–∆∆CT methods. The
experiments were done separately in triplicate.

Western blot analysis
Western blot was employed as described in the
protocol (Santa Cruz). Briefly, cells were harvested, resuspended in RIPA buffer with protein cocktail inhibitors,

slides in citrate buffer (10 mmol/L; pH 6.0) for 20 min.
Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with mouse
monoclonal antibody Notch1 (1:300) or rabbit polyclonal
antibody NR4A2 (Nurr1) (1:200) and then washed with
PBS. The washed sections were incubated respectively
with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary
antibodies and goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies
(EarthOx, CA, USA) at room temperature for 30 min. and

Cell apoptosis and cell cycle analysis

None.

Cells were plated on 6-well plates and incubated
overnight. The test compounds were added. Cells were
incubated again overnight and then were harvested for
the assay. For the apoptosis assay, the Annexin V-FITC
apoptosis detection kit (Cat. No.: APOAF) was purchased
from Sigma (Saint Louis, MO). Into 500 μls of cell
suspension was added 5 μl of Annexin V-FITC conjugate
and 10 μl of a propidium iodide solution. The mixture
was incubated for 10 minutes and assayed to determine
fluorescence using a Beckman-Coulter Gallios analyzer.
Data were analyzed with Gallios software. For the cell
cycle assay, the Coulter DNA Prep reagents kit (Cat.
No.: PN 6607055) from Beckman Coulter (Fullerton,
CA) was used. Analysis was done on a Beckman-Coulter
Epics FC500 analyzer using CXP software for acquisition
and the ModFit LT v3.1 (Verity Software) for cell cycle
modeling. Both experiments were repeated three times.

Cell proliferation assay
The cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI)
was performed as described previously (23). Briefly, 50 μl
aliquots of medium with different concentrations of
compounds were added to 96-well plates. All compound
concentrations were tested in triplicate. Another 50 μl of
the cell stock (1 × 105 cells/μl of media) was dispensed
into each well and the plates were incubated at 37°C in a
CO2 incubator for 3 days. Following the incubation period,
15 ml of the dye solution was added to each well and the
plates were then incubated at 37°C for 4 hours, followed
by the addition of 100 µl per well of the solubilization
solution. The plates were incubated at 37°C until the
contents in each well became a uniform-colored solution.
The absorbance was measured and recorded at 570 nm by
a Victor Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA).
