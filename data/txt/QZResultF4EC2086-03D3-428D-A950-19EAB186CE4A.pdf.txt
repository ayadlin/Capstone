ABSTRACT
DNA damaging agents cause rapid shrinkage of tumors and form the basis of
chemotherapy for sarcomas despite significant toxicities. Drugs having superior
efficacy and wider therapeutic windows are needed to improve patient outcomes.
We used cell proliferation and apoptosis assays in sarcoma cell lines and benign
cells; γ-H2AX expression, comet assay, immunoblot analyses and drug combination
studies in vitro and in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. BO-1055 caused
apoptosis and cell death in a concentration and time dependent manner in sarcoma
cell lines. BO-1055 had potent activity (submicromolar IC50) against Ewing sarcoma
and rhabdomyosarcoma, intermediate activity in DSRCT (IC50 = 2-3μM) and very
weak activity in osteosarcoma (IC50 >10μM) cell lines. BO-1055 exhibited a wide
therapeutic window compared to other DNA damaging drugs. BO-1055 induced
more DNA double strand breaks and γH2AX expression in cancer cells compared
to benign cells. BO-1055 showed inhibition of tumor growth in A673 xenografts
and caused tumor regression in cyclophosphamide resistant patient-derived Ewing
sarcoma xenografts and A204 xenografts. Combination of BO-1055 and irinotecan
demonstrated synergism in Ewing sarcoma PDX models. Potent activity on sarcoma
cells and its relative lack of toxicity presents a strong rationale for further development
of BO-1055 as a therapeutic agent.

INTRODUCTION

solubility, we linked a benzene moiety with various
hydrophilic side chains to the N-mustard moiety and
evaluated the cytotoxicity in various cancer cell lines
in vitro and in human xenograft models [6]. Of these
agents, BO-1055 (water-soluble Ureidomustine) was
found to have a broad spectrum of antitumor activity
with a favorable safety profile and pharmacokinetics in
pre-clinical studies [7, 8]. In this study, we evaluated its
efficacy in sarcomas and performed a comprehensive
toxicity screening in a range of benign cells.
BO-1055 (Figure 1A) is a bifunctional alkylating
agent that is able to induce interstrand cross-links (ICLs)
[4]. The potency of this class of drugs correlates with the
extent of ICL formation. ICLs cause replication arrest,
induction of DNA double-strand breaks and can ultimately

Alkylating agents are a part of the standard of care
regimens for a number of pediatric and adult malignancies.
Currently used alkylating drugs play a significant role
in the management of soft tissue sarcomas and Ewing
sarcoma, both as first-line and second-line treatments
[1, 2] albeit with substantial toxicities. Therefore, there
is a need for safer and less toxic alternatives that do not
exhibit multi-drug cross-resistance. We have previously
designed and synthesized a series of potent alkylating
agents, in which the phenyl N-mustard pharmacophore is
linked to the DNA-affinic molecule via a urea, carbamate
or hydrazinecarboxamide linker to reduce the chemical
reactivity of N-mustard [3-5]. To improve the waterwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

trigger cell death [9]. Repair of ICLs was noted to be one
of the prominent mechanisms of resistance to N-mustard
derivatives, e. g, resistance to melphalan in multiple
myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [10, 11].
There are different mechanisms involved in the repair of
DNA lesions induced by specific alkylating agents and
different tumors vary widely in their ability to repair such
lesions [9]. DNA damage induced by BO-1055 is repaired
by a number of mechanisms including nucleotide excision
repair (NER), homologous recombination (HR) and O6methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) [12].
Like melphalan, BO-1055 induces N-alkyl adducts that
are repairable by NER and HR pathways. In addition, BO1055 produces O-alkyl adducts (like BCNU/carmustine),
which are repairable by MGMT [12]. Because of tumor
heterogeneity, cells that evade the cytotoxic stress undergo
selective expansion of resistant clones leading to treatment
failure [13]. For successful elimination of all cancer cells,
one has to employ multi-drug combinations that will
produce diverse genomic lesions to overcome the ability
of cells to escape the effects of single drug. Therefore,
in this study, we evaluated the single agent activity of
BO-1055 and its combination with topoisomerase I and

II inhibitors, heat shock protein 90 inhibitor (PU-H71)
and anthracycline (doxorubicin), based on their potential
for synergism with alkylating agents. We validated our
results in patient derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models
that have been shown to correlate better with the antitumor
activity noted in patients [14].

RESULTS
BO-1055 inhibits proliferation and induces cell
death in different sarcoma cell lines and cultures
derived from patient samples with minimal
toxicity to benign cells
BO-1055 had submicromolar IC50 values for Ewing
sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and Ewing
sarcoma patient samples. It had intermediate activity on
DSRCT cell lines (IC50 = 2-3μM) and very weak activity
on osteosarcoma cell lines (IC50 > 10μM). The activity of
BO-1055 in sarcomas was evaluated and compared to that

in various other cancer cell lines including lymphomas,
prostate, colon, renal, breast, small cell lung cancer,
myeloid and lymphoid leukemias (Figure 1B). It revealed
that this agent has superior activity in Ewing sarcoma and
rhabdomyosarcoma and poor activity in osteosarcoma
(Figure 1B, 1C). A representative sample of growth
inhibition curves for sarcoma cell lines are shown in Figure
1C with mean IC50 for BO-1055. We compared the antiproliferative effect of BO-1055 and 4-HC in vitro (Figure
1D) at various concentrations by spheroid formation assay.
As shown in Figure 1D, BO-1055 was able to inhibit A673
spheroids at a 10 fold lower concentration when compared
to 4-HC. Complete inhibition of spheroids was noted at
0.5μM of BO-1055 and 5μM of 4-HC.
We also examined the effect of BO-1055 in
inhibiting the cell growth of different types of benign cells
including human mesenchymal stromal cells, fetal lung
fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, hematopoietic progenitor
cells, bone marrow derived endothelial cells and human

umbilical vein endothelial cells and murine mesenchymal
stromal cells, MS-5 (murine). Remarkably, it was revealed
that BO-1055 had minimal to no cytotoxicity up to 10 μM
(Figure 2A, 2B) against most of the tested cells.

BO-1055 has a wider therapeutic window in
comparison to other DNA damaging agents and
chemotherapeutic agents
We tested the activity of DNA damaging agents
including 4-HC, cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide and BO1055 in hematopoietic progenitor cells (by colony forming
unit (CFU) assay), HUVEC, human MSC and compared it
to their activity in A673 cells to determine their therapeutic
window. The ratio of IC50 in benign cells to that of Ewing
sarcoma (A673) cells is shown for each drug. BO-1055
has one of the more favorable profiles (wider therapeutic
window) in different benign cell models (Figure 2C).

Effect of BO-1055 on hematopoietic progenitor
cells

BO-1055 induces caspase mediated cell death in
sarcoma cell lines

We performed the colony forming unit (CFU) assays
using human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells isolated
from cord blood to elucidate hematologic toxicity. We
noted no effect on BFU-E, GM and mixed colonies at a
concentration < 5μM of BO-1055 on CFU assay (Figure
2C). In vivo toxicity testing of BO-1055 in C57 healthy
mice did not reveal a significant change in hematocrit,
platelet count or neutrophil count at day 10 (Figure 2D).

In order to quantify the apoptosis ratio in A673 cells
treated with BO-1055 we performed Annexin V-APC/7AAD staining assays. Early apoptosis was defined as the
presence of Annexin V-positive and 7-AAD-negative
cells. Late apoptosis was defined as Annexin V-positive
and 7-AAD-positive cells. Total percent apoptosis was
defined as the sum of early and late apoptotic cells as a
percentage of the total cell number. BO-1055 induces
apoptosis in the A673 cell line in a time-concentration
dependent manner (Figure 3B). Around 50 % of treated
cells entered apoptosis after 48 h at concentrations of
1μM. Activation of caspase 3/7 in A673 cells was noted
in a concentration dependent manner using ApoTox -Glo
Triplex Assay (Figure 3C).

BO-1055 induces cell cycle arrest in G2 phase
We studied the effects of BO-1055 on the cell
cycle of A673 and A204 cells and found a concentrationdependent accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase
(Figure 3A) that was prominent at 12-24h of exposure.

double stranded breaks and is responsible for recruiting
DNA repair proteins. Assessment of γH2AX foci by flow
cytometry allows assessment of DNA damage and repair
[16]. γH2AX level was significantly elevated in A673 cells
compared to hMSC and cord blood CD34+ cells (Figure
4C) suggesting greater DNA damage to the A673 cells
when compared to benign cells.

We used comet assay [15], which includes single
cell gel electrophoresis to assess DNA breaks when
exposed to radiation or DNA damaging agents. Comet
assay showed increased tail size suggesting accumulation
of DNA breaks in A673 cells, as the concentration of
BO-1055 was increased. Olive moment (micrometers),
a product of tail DNA% and the distance between the
centroids of head and tail, is an accurate parameter of
DNA damage. In A673 cells treated with BO-1055 and
radiation (XRT) olive moment is comparable. Human
MSC and cord blood CD34+ cells treated with BO-1055
have relatively less olive moment compared to XRT
(Figure 4B) suggesting less toxicity of BO-1055 to the
benign cells. Gamma-H2AX (γH2AX) phosphorylation
is the initial step in DNA damage response following

Induction of DNA repair proteins in cells treated
with BO-1055 suggests role of multiple DNA

At 6h and 24h after treatment with BO-1055, we
noted activation of pATM in both sensitive cell lines:
A673 (Ewing sarcoma), H526 (small cell lung cancer) and
resistant cell line: U20S. Upregulation of Rad50 was noted
in the sensitive lines whereas upregulation of pBRCA1
was noted in U20S (Figure 4D).

A204 xenografts was noted in the treatment group (Figure
5C) with no significant decrease in body weight. Patient
derived xenografts were established from Ewing sarcoma
patients who progressed through first line chemotherapy
that included cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
ifosfamide and etoposide (PS3). When these Ewing
sarcoma xenografts (n = 10) reached 100mm3, they were
randomized to control and treatment groups. When the
tumors progressed to 500mm3 in the treatment group after
receiving MTD doses of cyclophosphamide, the mice
were treated with BO-1055 30mg/kg/dose q2d x 4, which
resulted in tumor regression (Figure 5D).

BO-1055 caused inhibition of tumor growth in
A673 xenografts (n = 20) and prolonged survival when
mice were treated with BO-1055 at 10mg/kg, 20mg/

3 doses (shown by shorter arrows). Tumor growth was not inhibited in the cyclophosphamide treated mice. When the tumors reached above
500mm3, we started treatment with BO-1055 at a dose of 30mg/kg i.v. q2d for 4 doses (shown by longer arrows).

combination (Figure 6A-6D). Patient derived Ewing
sarcoma xenografts were established in NSG mice and
they were randomized into 4 groups as mentioned in
the methods section. Tumor regression was significantly
greater in the combination group compared to BO-1055 or

DISCUSSION

has been a challenge, resulting in delay in treatment cycles
and infectious complications. Hematopoietic toxicity was
partly alleviated by the administration of G-CSF [32]
and allowed dose-escalation [33]. Interval compressed
cytotoxic chemotherapy administered every 2 weeks
as opposed to every 3 weeks has produced superior
results in localized Ewing sarcoma [34]. Overcoming
hematopoietic and organ toxicities will allow us to
administer chemotherapy at a higher dose and at a shorter
interval, which can potentially result in better cure rates.
BO-1055 exhibited a remarkable therapeutic window for
hematopoietic progenitors as noted on CFC assay (Figure
2B). Compared to other DNA damaging agents including
4-HC, etoposide and cisplatin, BO-1055 had a 25-50 fold
broader therapeutic window (Figure 2C). This was also
seen in the in vivo toxicity study in C57 healthy mice
where hematologic toxicity was not observed at day 10
after 5 doses of BO-1055 at 30mg/kg/dose (Supplementary
table 1).
As a single agent, suppression of A673 tumor growth
was maintained with BO-1055 at 30mg/kg/dose during
the course of treatment and significant tumor suppression
and prolongation of survival was noted with 10mg/kg,
20mg/kg and 30mg/kg doses in treated mice compared to
control mice. In A204 (rhabdoid) tumor bearing mice, BO1055 caused complete regression of tumors. In a patient
derived xenograft model, Ewing sarcoma tumors that
were resistant to cyclophosphamide showed regression of
tumors with 4 doses of BO-1055, suggesting lack of cross
resistance with cyclophosphamide. Acquired resistance
to alkylating agents is a frequently encountered clinical
problem that results in treatment failure. Cross -resistance
to various alkylating agents is an established phenomenon
but not seen with all the agents in this class of drugs [35,
36]. BO-1055 was shown to retain cytotoxicity against
CCRF-CEM/Taxol cells, which are 330-fold resistant
to taxol. In comparison, BO-1055 has only a 9.4 fold
resistance to CCRF-CEM/Taxol, suggesting that BO1055 is not a good substrate of membrane multidrug
resistance transporters including p-glycoprotein [6].
Cytotoxic activity in PGP-expressing cell lines and in
cyclophosphamide resistant xenografts suggests that BO1055 may not share the same resistance mechanisms with
other agents.
DNA damaging agents have been shown to have
synergistic effects with a number of drugs based on
cell cycle specific actions, topoisomerase inhibition
and induction of cellular stress response. We therefore
tested four combinations including topotecan, SN38,
doxorubicin and PU-H71. We noted synergism with
each of these drugs, but the combination with SN38 was
highly synergistic. An in vivo experiment in NSG mice
bearing patient-derived Ewing sarcoma xenografts using
Irinotecan and BO-1055 showed significantly greater
tumor regression compared to single drugs, suggesting
a potential utility of this combination for maximal anti-

Sarcomas account for 10-15% of all pediatric
cancers. Overall survival for children with relapsed and
metastatic sarcomas is poor and remains unchanged over
the past 2 decades [17]. Alkylating agents including
cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide and temozolomide are
active in various sarcomas and are part of first line and
second line chemotherapy regimens [1, 18-21]. There have
been ongoing efforts to develop novel alkylating agents to
avoid the side effects seen with the standard agents [2224], however it is yet to be determined if any of them are
superior to the earlier agents.
We have developed a series of water-soluble
N-mustard-benzene conjugates with potent antitumor
activity. Of these derivatives, we previously demonstrated
that BO-1055 (Ureidomustine) has a broad spectrum of
antitumor activity [6, 25, 26] and has little or no cross
resistance to taxol or vinblastine in leukemia cell lines
[6]. In the present studies, we further demonstrate that
this agent has a wide therapeutic window determined by
comparing its cytotoxicity in various benign cells and in
sarcoma preclinical models, including tumors that are
resistant to cyclophosphamide. BO-1055 is a bi-functional
alkylating agent that induces interstrand cross-linking
and double stranded breaks leading to G2/M arrest and
apoptosis of rapidly proliferating cells [12]. Typically
cells respond by activating DNA repair mechanisms to
restore integrity of the genome. Cells that have deficient
repair mechanisms are exquisitely sensitive to such agents
[27]. As shown in Figure 1, some cell lines including
osteosarcomas are resistant to BO-1055. It is possible
that a variation in DNA damage repair mechanisms
could be contributing to resistance in these cell lines.
In fact, polymorphisms in DNA repair and glutathioneS-transferase genes were shown to influence treatment
outcome in osteosarcoma [28]. Increased sensitivity to
DNA damaging agents in Ewing sarcoma can be explained
by defective DNA break repair and down regulation of
DNA repair genes BRCA1, GEN1, and ATM [29, 30]. We
noted an increase in the expression of pATM suggesting
activation of ATM mediated DNA repair mechanism in
cell lines that were both sensitive and resistant to BO1055.
BO-1055 exhibited remarkable lack of toxicity
in normal benign cells including mesenchymal stromal
cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells, and endothelial
cells which may indicate an alternative option to the
widely used toxic alkylating agents. The findings on
comet assay and γ-H2AX expression suggest that BO1055 induces far less DNA double strand breaks in hMSC
and CD34+ hematopoietic cells when compared to A673
Ewing sarcoma cells. A number of pre-clinical and clinical
studies have shown that dose escalation of cytotoxic
agents resulted in improved cure rates for solid tumors and
hematopoietic malignancies [31]. However myelotoxicity

tumor activity. Synergism between DNA cross-linking
agents and topoisomerase 1 inhibitors has been suggested
in other cancer models, partly due to increased retention
of DNA interstrand crosslinks [37-39]. Recent clinical
trials that evaluated a combination of irinotecan and
alkylating agents such as temozolomide have proven to
be safe and effective in pediatric solid tumors [19, 40,
41]. The pharmacokinetics of BO-1055 has been studied
in rats using high-performance liquid chromatography
with photodiode array (HPLC-PDA) method suggesting
an acceptable PK profile with rapid distribution to all
organs except brain and a slow elimination of the drug
[7]. We noticed that certain cell lines and tumor types
e.g. osteosarcoma were resistant to BO-1055. Further
elucidation of mechanisms of resistance and biomarkers
for predicting the sensitivity cell lines to BO-1055 is being
studied. Superior single agent activity, minimal toxicity
to benign cells, lack of cross resistance, synergism with
topoisomerase inhibitors and favorable pharmacokinetics
are some of the promising attributes that warrant clinical
evaluation of BO-1055 in pediatric sarcomas.

BO-1055 was synthesized at Dr. Tsann Long
Su’s laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences
(IBMS), Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. PU-H71
was synthesized at Dr. Gabriela Chiosis’ laboratory at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC),
New York, NY, USA. Topotecan was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO), etoposide, melphalan
and 4-hydroperoxy cyclophosphamide (4-HC) were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX).
SN38, Bendamustine hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate
and cisplatin were purchased from Tocris (Bio-Techne,
Minneapolis, MN). Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide
were purchased from the pharmacy at MSKCC.

Assessment of cell proliferation
AlamarBlue® assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) was performed to evaluate anti-proliferative activity
of the drugs in cell lines and primary cells. Cells were
plated in 96-well plates (5x105 cells/well in 200 μL of
medium). After 12 h, one of the previously mentioned
drugs was added to each well at the specified concentration
and incubated for 72 h. At the end of the incubation period,
43070

20 μL of stock solution (0.312 mg/mL) of the Alamar Blue
was added to each well. The absorbance was measured
using the Synergy H1 hybrid multi-mode microplate
reader (BioTek, USA). The drug effect was quantified as
the percentage of control absorbance at 540 nm and 585
nm. Optical density was determined for 3 replicates per
treatment condition and cell proliferation in drug-treated
cells was normalized to their respective controls. All
experiments were performed in triplicate.

70% ethanol, and incubated with propidium iodide/RNase
buffer (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) for 15 minutes
at room temperature. Data was collected on BD LSR
Fortessa fluorescence-activated cell analyzer using BD
FACS Diva software and analyzed using FlowJo version
9.6 software (Tree Star, Inc. Ashland, OR). Cell cycle
analysis was done by applying the Dean/Jett/Fox cell cycle
model using FlowJo software.

Measurement of DNA damage using comet assay

Caspase 3/7 activity

Comet assay was performed according to the
protocol described earlier [15]. Cells were treated with
BO-1055 at 2μM concentration for 3h, or immediately
after exposure to 8Gy radiation after which they were
isolated and mixed with 1% low melting point agarose
in a tube. The cells in agarose were transferred to slides
coated with normal melting point agarose. The agaroseimmobilized cells were lysed in alkaline solution and the
agarose trapped DNA was electrophoresed. DNA was
stained with ethidium bromide and image acquisition
was done immediately. DNA damage quantification was
performed using using OpenComet v1.3, an open-source
software plugin in Image J 1.47v software (NIH, USA)
for automated analysis. [29] Olive moment, which is
the product of tail DNA% and the distance between the
intensity-weighted centroids of head and tail was taken
from the output for analysis. [46]

A673 cells were plated at a density of 5 x 103 cells/
well in 96 well plates. After overnight incubation, BO1055 was added at specified concentrations as shown in
Figure 3C. At 48h and 72h post drug exposure, 100µl of
Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent provided in the ApoTox -Glo
Triplex Assay (Promega, USA) was added as per the
protocol and the luminescence, which indicates caspase
activation, was measured using the Synergy H1 hybrid
microplate reader.

Colony forming unit assay (CFU) assay
Colony assays were performed in triplicate in 24
well plates using 1.2% methylcellulose (Dow Chemical,
Waterloo, NY), 30% FCS, 57.2 µM β-mercaptoethanol, 2
mM glutamine, 0.5 mM hemin (Sigma, USA), 20 ng/mL
interleukin 3 (IL-3), granulocyte colony stimulating factor
(G-CSF), c-KIT ligand (KL) and 6 U/mL erythropoietin
(Epo). IL-3 and KL and Epo were obtained from R and
D Systems (Minneapolis, USA) and G-CSF was from
Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). Colonies were scored 14
days after plating as per the protocol described earlier [42].

Determination of γ-H2AX expression in cells
Staining of γ-H2AX antigen was carried out
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, human
sarcoma cells and human mesenchymal stem cells were
treated with various concentrations of BO-1055 at 37oC.
At 3h, the cultures were washed with 1 ml of cold PBS
three times, detached with 0.05% trypsin, and cells were
pelleted. The pelleted cells were resuspended with 0.2 ml
Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Bioscience), incubated at
4oC for 20 minutes, and then washed with 1 ml cold Perm/
Wash solution (BD Bioscience) three times. After antihuman γ-H2AX antibody (BD Bioscience) staining, the
specimens were subjected to flow cytometric analysis via
a Calibur flow instrument (BD Bioscience).

Spheroid assay in 3D culture
A673 cells were seeded on flat bottom non
attachment 24 well plates (1000 cells/ well) in triplicate
using 1.2 % methylcellulose (Dow Chemical, Waterloo,
NY) mixed with 20% FCS and specified concentrations of
BO-1055 or 4HC as shown in Figure 1D. Samples were
incubated at 37 ºC / 5 % CO2 and colonies were scored 14
days after plating.

Immunoblot analyses

Flow cytometry

Protein concentrations were determined using the
BCA kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein lysates (20100 μg) were electrophoretically resolved by SDS/PAGE,
transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with
the indicated primary antibodies: Phospho-ATM (Ser1981)
(D6H9) from rabbit (1:500, 5883, Cell Signaling, Danvers,

Cell viability and apoptosis were determined using
7-AAD (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and Annexin
V-APC (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) staining
according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer
and as previously published [43-45]. Cell cycle fractions
were determined by propidium iodide nuclear staining.
Briefly, cells were harvested, washed in PBS, fixed with

MA), Phospho-BRCA1 (Ser1524) from rabbit (1:500,
9009, Cell Signaling), DNA-PK from rabbit (1:500, 4602,
Cell Signaling), Mre11 (31H4) from rabbit (1:500, 4847,
Cell Signaling) and Rad50 from rabbit (1:500, 3427,
Cell Signaling). Membranes were then incubated with a
1:5,000 dilution of a peroxidase conjugated corresponding
secondary antibody. Equal loading of the protein samples
was confirmed by parallel western blots for β-actin
(1:5,000, ab822750; Abcam). Detection was performed
using the ECL-Enhanced Chemiluminescence Detection
System (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Blots were
visualized by autoradiography.

4 doses (shown by longer arrows in Figure 4F). For the
combination in vivo study, we used PDX from Ewing
sarcoma patients that were established in NSG mice (n =
12-20 per PDX model) and randomized into 4 groups: the
Control group received PBS, the BO-1055 group received
5 mg/kg in one PDX model and 10mg/kg in another PDX
model IV daily for 5 days, the Irinotecan group received
5 mg/kg in one PDX model and 10mg/kg in another PDX
model IP daily for 5 days and the combination groups
received both the drugs at the same dose schedule.

Assessment of tumor progression in sarcoma in
vivo model

The AlamarBlue® cell proliferation assay was used
to test the effect of a single drug and a combination of
drugs. A673 cells (5 x 103 cells/well) were added to 96
well plates in triplicate. After 12h incubation, BO-1055
and a second drug (Topotecan, SN38, Doxorubicin or
PU-H71) were added simultaneously in a lattice format
in varying concentrations. Plates were read after 72h drug
exposure. Combination indices were derived as described
below to identify the interaction in two-drug combinations.

Drug combination studies

All mouse experiments were performed at the
animal core facility at MSKCC under an approved
protocol following the IACUC guidelines. Five to sevenweek-old NOD/SCID IL2R gamma null (NSG) mice
(bred at the Mouse Genetics Core Facility, MSKCC)
were used for in vivo experiments. All mouse experiments
were done following the IACUC guidelines at the animal
facility at MSKCC. Tumors were induced using 106
A673 cells or A204 cells in 0.2ml 1:1 cellular medium,
Matrigel matrix (BD Bioscience, Bedford, MA) and
injected subcutaneously (s.q) into the right flank. The
tumors were measured every 3 d with a caliper, and the
diameters were recorded. Tumor volume was calculated
by the formula a2 b/2 where ‘a’ is the smallest and ‘b’ is
the largest diameter. When the tumors reached 100mm3,
we randomized mice into control and drug treatment
groups. Treatment groups received BO-1055 by tail
vein injection at 10mg/kg, 20mg/kg and 30mg/kg q2d
x 5 doses for mice bearing A673 xenografts. BO-1055
was given at 30mg/kg q2d x 5 doses for mice bearing
A204 xenografts. De-identified patient tumor tissues
were obtained in accordance with and approval from the
MSKCC Institutional Review Board (IRB). Appropriate
written consent and assent were obtained from the patients
prior to sample collection. Patient derived xenografts were
developed in NSG mice (second passage) from a patient
with relapsed Ewing sarcoma, who was treated with two
alkylating agents- cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide as
part of a multi-agent chemotherapy prior to relapse. When
the tumors reached 100mm2, we randomized mice into
control and drug treatment groups. Mice in the control
groups received PBS injections while mice in the drug
treatment group received the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) of cyclophosphamide 70mg/kg i.p. q2d x 3 (shown
by shorter arrows) (Figure 5D). Tumor growth was not
inhibited in the cyclophosphamide treated mice. When
the tumors reached a size greater than 500mm3, we started
treatment with BO-1055 at a dose of 30mg/kg i.v. q2d x
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean±S.E.M. of at least
three independent experiments done in triplicate. The
comparison of means between treated and control mice
was performed using two-tailed T-test or ANOVA (for
more than two groups) as implemented in GraphPad Prism
(version 4; GraphPad Software). Graphpad Prism software
was used to plot concentration-effect curves and determine
the drug concentration that inhibited the growth of cell
lines by 50% compared to the control (IC50). A p-value of
0.05 or less was considered significant. Combination index
(CI) values, as calculated by CompuSyn software (Chou
and Martin, 2007), were used to evaluate the interaction
between BO-1055 and a second drug (Topotecan, SN38,
Doxorubicin or PU-H71). The Chou-Talalay method was
used to quantify the synergism (CI < 1), additive effect (CI
= 1) and antagonism (CI > 1) of various drug combinations
[47].
