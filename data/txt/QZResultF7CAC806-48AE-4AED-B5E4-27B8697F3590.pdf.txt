SUMMARY
Author Manuscript

The BH4 domain of Bcl2 is required for its antiapoptotic function, thus constituting a promising
anticancer target. We identified a small molecule Bcl2-BH4 domain-antagonist (BDA-366) that
binds BH4 with high affinity and selectivity. BDA-366-Bcl2 binding induces conformational
change in Bcl2 that abrogates its antiapoptotic function, converting it from a survival to a cell
death inducer. BDA-366 suppresses growth of lung cancer xenografts derived from cell lines and
patient without significant normal tissue toxicity at effective doses. mTOR inhibition up-regulates
Bcl2 in lung cancer cells and tumor tissues from clinical trial patients. Combined BDA-366 and
RAD001 treatment exhibits strong synergy against lung cancer in vivo. Development of this Bcl2BH4 antagonist may provide a strategy to improve lung cancer outcome.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States, accounting
for more deaths than breast, prostate and pancreatic cancer combined (Jemal et al., 2007).
Up-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl2 family members (i.e. Bcl2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1) and
dysregulation of proapoptotic family members (i.e. Bad, Bim, Bax, Bak, etc.) are involved
in the mediation of chemo- or radioresistance in human lung cancers (Sartorius and
Krammer, 2002; Song et al., 2005), suggesting that Bcl2 family members have the potential
to be critical targets for lung cancer treatment.

The Bcl2 family members have homology clustered within four conserved Bcl2 homology
(BH) domains (i.e. BH1, BH2, BH3 and BH4) (Kelekar and Thompson, 1998). The BH1,
BH2 and BH3 domains form the surface binding pocket of Bcl2 which mediates proteinprotein interactions between Bcl2 family members (Castelli et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2000).
This hydrophobic surface binding pocket is required for the antiapoptotic function of Bcl2,
as studies have shown that mutations at this site abolish the biological function of Bcl2 (Yin
et al., 1994). BH3-mimetic Bcl2 inhibitors ABT-737 and ABT-263 (the oral form of
ABT-737) bind to the hydrophobic pocket of Bcl2 or Bcl-XL with a high-affinity and
subsequently disrupt the antiapoptotic function of Bcl2 and Bcl-XL with potent anti-tumor
effect (Konopleva et al., 2006; Oltersdorf et al., 2005; Tse et al., 2008). However, ABT-737
and ABT-263 can induce thrombocytopenia due to their inhibitory effects on both Bcl2 and
Bcl-XL (Schoenwaelder et al., 2011). To generate a Bcl2 selective inhibitor, a tethered
indole was incorporated into ABT-263 to fill the P4 hot spot, which specifically interacts
with aspartic acid (Asp 103) of Bcl2 but not Glu96 of Bcl-XL, leading to the generation of
the Bcl2-selective inhibitor ABT-199 (Souers et al., 2013). Since ABT-199 did not cause
thrombocytopenia in vivo (Souers et al., 2013), this suggests that highly selective inhibition
of Bcl2 may benefit the development of improved Bcl2 antagonists.

Author Manuscript

The BH4 region is a survival domain that is required for the antiapoptotic function of Bcl2
as demonstrated by the complete abolition of the antiapoptotic activity of Bcl2 or conversion
of Bcl2 from survival protein into a proapoptotic molecule when the BH4 domain is
removed (Cheng et al., 1997; de Moissac et al., 1999; Hirotani et al., 1999; Hunter et al.,
1996; Reed et al., 1996), indicating that the BH4 is an ideal target for screening of small
molecules that may convert Bcl2 into a death molecule in tumor tissues for anti-cancer
therapeutics. The major goal of the present study is to identify a small molecule Bcl2 BH4
domain antagonist for lung cancer therapy.

RESULTS
Screening of small molecules targeting the BH4 domain of Bcl2

Author Manuscript

A library containing approximately 300,000 small molecules from the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) was used to dock the structural pocket of the BH4 domain (aa6-31; PDB ID
codes: 1G5M and 1G5O) using the UCSF DOCK 6.1 program suite (Figure 1A, left panel)
as we previously described (Park et al., 2013). The small molecules were ranked according
to their energy scores. The top 200 small molecules were selected for screening of
cytotoxicity in human lung cancer cells by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay as described (Liu
et al., 2012; Vichai and Kirtikara, 2006). Among these small molecules, one compound (i.e.
NSC639366, C24H29N3O4, MW: 423.50) had the most potent activity against human lung
cancer cells. We named this lead compound small molecule Bcl2 BH4 domain antagonist
(BDA-366). The molecular modeling of this lead in complex with the Bcl2 BH4 domain is
shown in Figure 1A, right panel.

Author Manuscript

The effect of BDA-366 on cell growth and apoptosis was measured by SRB assay and
Annexin V/PI binding, respectively, in both small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines that express various levels of endogenous Bcl2. Results
indicate that NSCLC cell lines (i.e. H157, Calu-1, H358, H460 and H1975) and SCLC cell
lines (i.e. DMS53, DMS153, H146 and H69) that express relatively higher levels of Bcl2
were more sensitive to BDA-366. In contrast, lung cancer cell lines expressing relatively
lower or undetectable levels of endogenous Bcl2 (i.e. NSCLC cell lines: A549 and H1299;
SCLC cell lines: DMS114 and H128) were less sensitive to BDA-366 (Figures 1B and 1C,
Tables S1 and S2). It seems that expression levels of Mcl-1 or Bcl-XL did not significantly
affect sensitivity of cells to BDA-366. Based on our findings, we propose that the apoptotic
response of BDA-366 may be dependent on the expression levels of Bcl2 in lung cancer cell
lines. Importantly, BDA-366 showed less sensitive to normal small airway epithelial cell
line (SAEC) (Figure 1C), indicating a relative selectivity against cancer cells compared to
normal cells.
BDA-366 selectively binds to Bcl2 at the BH4 domain and induces cell killing

Author Manuscript

Purified recombinant WT and a panel of Bcl2 BH domain deletion mutant proteins (i.e.
ΔBH1, ΔBH2, ΔBH3 and ΔBH4) were commercially obtained from ProteinX Lab (San
Diego, CA) as described previously (Wang et al., 2008; Xie et al., 2014). To directly
measure BDA-366/Bcl2 binding, a fluorescence polarization assay with a fluorescent Bak
peptide (5′-FAM-GQVGRQLAIIGDDINR) was performed as previously described
(Bruncko et al., 2007; Enyedy et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2002). We found
that BDA-366 directly binds to Bcl2 with high binding affinity (Ki =3.3 ± 0.73 nM) (Figure
S1A). Deletion of BH1, BH2 or BH3 from Bcl2 protein did not significantly affect its
BDA-366 binding. However, the BH4 domain deficient Bcl2 mutant protein (ΔBH4) failed
to bind BDA-366 (Figure S1A). These findings indicate that BDA-366 selectively binds to
Bcl2 via the BH4 domain. Importantly, BDA-366 did not bind to other Bcl2 family
members, including Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, or Bfl-1/A1 (Figure S1B), indicating the specificity of
its Bcl2 binding.

Structural modeling analysis by computational program reveals that BDA-366 is associated
with 8 amino acids (i.e. ASP10, ASN11, ARG12, GLU13, MET16, LYS17, HIS20 and
ASP31) in the BH4 domain. We generated a panel of Bcl2 mutants within the BH4 domain
at the specific residues that were identified by the initial docking simulations, including
D10A, N11A, R12A, E13A, M16A, K17A, H20A and D31A Bcl2 mutants. We also created
a compound Bcl2 mutant D10A/N11A/R12A/E13A (AAAA). First, the recombinant
proteins of these mutants were generated for BDA-366/Bcl2 binding analysis using a
competitive fluorescence polarization as described in “Supplemental Experimental
Procedures”. Ki values were: D10A→4.8 ± 0.41nM, N11A→4.1 ± 0.67nM, R12A→4.3 ±
0.54 nM, E13A→4.5 ± 0.71 nM, M16A→ 3.9 ± 0.31nM, K17A→4.2 ± 0.45 nM,
H20A→3.8 ± 0.47 nM, D31A→3.7 ± 0.91nM, AAAA→598.64 ± 0.12nM. These findings
indicate that single mutation at each individual residue did not significantly reduce Bcl2’s
ability to bind BDA-366 but AAAA Bcl2 mutant protein had remarkably decreased
BDA-366 binding. Second, WT and all Bcl2 mutants were exogenously overexpressed in
H1299 cells that express undetectable levels of endogenous Bcl2. Results indicate that
overexpression of exogenous WT or each of the Bcl2 mutants in H1299 cells potently
inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death (Figures S1C and S1D), indicating that these
Bcl2 mutants retain standard anti-apoptotic function. However, overexpression of exogenous
WT and each of the Bcl2 single site mutants in H1299 cells failed to prolong cell survival
when cells were exposed to BDA-366 and exhibited enhanced sensitivity to BDA-366
(Figure S1E), indicating that BDA-366 not only overcomes Bcl2’s antiapoptotic function
but also may convert these Bcl2 proteins into death molecules. In contrast, overexpression of
the compound Bcl2 AAAA mutant significantly prolonged cell survival when cells were
exposed to BDA-366 (Figure S1E), suggesting that compound mutations (AAAA) at
BDA-366 binding residues lead to a phenotype that is resistant to BDA-366. This suggests
that BDA-366 binding to these four amino acids (D10, N11, R12 and E13) in the BH4
domain is critical for BDA-366 regulation of Bcl2 and induction of apoptosis.

To determine whether Bcl-2 is the relevant target at the cellular level and whether cell
killing is truly dependent on this particular mechanism, Bcl2 was specifically knocked down
using three different Bcl2 shRNAs that target different regions in Bcl2 gene in five lung
cancer cell lines, including two NSCLC cell lines (H460 and H157) and three SCLC cell
lines (DMS53, DMS153 and H146). Stable expression of Bcl2 shRNA1, shRNA2 or
shRNA3 efficiently depleted the endogenous Bcl2 in both NSCLC and SCLC cell lines
(Figure S1F). This effect of shRNA on Bcl2 expression was highly specific because the
control shRNA had no effect. Cells expressing Bcl2 shRNA1, shRNA2, shRNA3 or control
shRNA were treated with BDA-366 (1μM) for 72 hr. The level of apoptotic cell death was
determined by analysis of Annexin-V/PI binding by FACS as we previously described
(Deng et al., 2006; Deng et al., 2001). Importantly, depletion of endogenous Bcl2 from these
lung cancer cell lines by Bcl2 shRNA1, shRNA2 or shRNA3 resulted in significantly
reduced sensitivity of cells to BDA-366 (Figure S1G).
We further examined whether expression of exogenous Bcl2 can restore the sensitivity of
Bcl2-silenced lung cancer cells to BDA-366, and whether the BDA-366/BH4 binding is
essential for such effect. WT and BDA-366 binding deficient D10A/N11A/R12A/E13A

(AAAA) Bcl2 mutant cDNA in pCIneo or vector-only control were transfected into H460 or
DMS53 cells expressing Bcl2 shRNA1. It has been reported that if the shRNA is directed to
the 3′ UTR or 5′ UTR of the gene, the effect of the shRNA can be rescued by ectopically
expressing the protein using the wild-type or mutant cDNA (Lassus et al., 2002; Lim et al.,
2009). Because Bcl2 shRNA1 targets the 5′UTR of endogenous Bcl2, the silencing effect of
shRNA1 on Bcl2 expression could be rescued by transfection of exogenous WT or AAAA
Bcl2 mutant, as shown in Figure S1H. After transfection, cells were treated with BDA-366
or the BH3 mimetic ABT-199 at the indicated concentrations for 72 hr. Results reveal that
expression of exogenous WT Bcl2 restored sensitivity of cells to both BDA-366 and
ABT-199 (Figures S1I and S1J), indicating that both BDA-366 and ABT-199 are selective
Bcl2 inhibitors. However, expression of AAAA only restored the sensitivity of cells to
ABT-199 but not to BDA-366 (Figures S1I and S1J), indicating that compound mutations in
the BH4 domain result in a selective resistance to BDA-366 while maintaining sensitivity to
the BH3 mimetic (ABT-199). These data suggest that BDA-366, but not ABT-199, acts as a
unique BH4 domain inhibitor. The apoptotic effect of BDA-366 on lung cancer cells
requires its BH4 binding.
To test whether BDA-366 reacts with DNA as a crosslinker, electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA) was performed as described (Bartel et al., 2012). Cisplatin, a known DNA
binding agent, was used as positive control. Plasmid pUC19 DNA was incubated with
BDA-366 or cisplatin. Intriguingly, cisplatin but not BDA-366 can bind to pUC19 DNA to
cause mobility shift (Figure S1K). This helps to rule out the possibility of BDA-366 as DNA
binding agent.
BDA-366 induces Bcl2 conformational change and abrogates Bcl2 survival function

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

A prior report indicates that the interaction between the nuclear orphan receptor Nur77/TR3
and Bcl2 or the binding of p53 to Bcl2 causes a conformational change in Bcl2 that induces
the “exposure” of its own BH3 domain, leading to loss of Bcl2’s antiapoptotic activity
(Deng et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2004). Furthermore, removal of the BH4 domain from Bcl2 by
caspase 3 results in a conversion of Bcl-2 from a survival protein to a Bax-like death
molecule (Cheng et al., 1997). Since BDA-366 is a BH4 domain binding molecule, its
binding to BH4 may result in a similar conformational change in Bcl2 to alter its function. It
has been reported that the Bcl2/BH3 domain-specific antibody can detect conformational
change in the BH3 domain of Bcl2 (Deng et al., 2006; Deng et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2004).
To test whether BDA-366 directly induces Bcl2 conformational change, an in vitro cell-free
assay was employed. Purified recombinant Bcl2 protein was incubated with increasing
concentrations of BDA-366 in lysis buffer, followed by immunoprecipitation (IP) using the
anti-Bcl2/BH3 domain antibody. Results indicate that addition of BDA-366 enhanced the
ability of the Bcl2/BH3 domain-specific antibody to bind Bcl2, and this occurred in a dosedependent manner (Figure 2A). These findings appear to provide direct evidence for the
notion that binding of BDA-366 with the BH4 domain is able to alter Bcl2’s conformation
leading to greater exposure of its own BH3 domain. Since only BDA-366 but not a
chemotherapeutic agent (i.e. VP-16 or cisplatin) can directly induce Bcl2 conformational
change in a cell-free system (Figure S2A), this shows specificity for BDA-366 induction of
such conformational change.

BDA-366-induced Bcl2 conformational change was also confirmed by immunofluorescence
using a Bcl2/BH3-domain specific antibody as described (Deng et al., 2006; Deng et al.,
2009; Lin et al., 2004). Bcl2 immunofluorescence was low or undetectable in untreated
H460 cells, and was enhanced significantly in cells treated with BDA-366 (Figure 2B).
However, treatment of H460 cells with BDA-366 did not significantly affect Bcl2
expression level (Figure S2B). These findings suggest that the negative regulation of Bcl2
activity by BDA-366 occurs through conformational change and not by a change in its
expression.

Author Manuscript

Because treatment of H460 cells with BDA-366 resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction (i.e.
reduced MitoSOX™ red staining and cytochrome c (Cyt c) release) and apoptosis (i.e. PARP
cleavage) (Figures 2C, 2D and 2E), the binding of BDA-366 to the BH4 domain may cause
exposure of the Bcl2 BH3 domain, which in turn renders Bcl2 eventually able to activate
Bax, leading to apoptosis. To test this possibility, a 6A7 Bax antibody that only recognizes
the conformationally changed, active, form of Bax was employed (Hsu et al., 1997; Hsu and
Youle, 1998). First, purified Bcl2 was treated with BDA-366 in lysis buffer for 1 hr. The
mixture of Bcl2/BDA-366 was then incubated with purified recombinant Bax for another 2
hr, followed by IP using 6A7 antibody. Results indicate that BDA-366-treated Bcl2 but not
Bcl2 alone enhanced the ability of Bax to bind to 6A7 antibody (Figure 2F, lane 4 vs. lanes
5–7), indicating that BDA-366-treated Bcl2 can induce Bax conformational change leading
to Bax activation. BAM7 is a recently identified Bax activator that can directly activate Bax
by binding to a Bax trigger site (Gavathiotis et al., 2012). Importantly, BAM7 but not
BDA-366 can directly activate Bax (Figure 2F, lane 2 vs. lane 3). These findings indicate
that BDA-366 is not a direct Bax activator but can induce Bcl2-dependent Bax activation
(Figure 2F, lane 3 vs. lanes 5–7). To test whether BDA-366-induced Bcl2 conformational
change increases interaction between Bcl2 and Bax in cells, co-IP experiments were
performed following treatment of H460 cells with BDA-366. Results reveal that BDA-366
enhanced Bcl2/Bax interaction in association with decreased Bcl2/Bim binding (Figure 2G),
suggesting that the BH3-exposed Bcl2 induced by BDA-366 may have greater ability to
interact with Bax than Bim leading to activation of Bax’s cell killing function via a 6A7
conformational change in cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

To further test whether the BH3 domain of Bcl2 is essential for BDA-366 activation of Bax,
first, purified recombinant WT and the BH3 deletion (ΔBH3) mutant Bcl2 proteins (Figure
3A) were incubated with purified Bax protein in the absence or presence of BDA-366,
followed by IP with 6A7 antibody. Results indicate that, in the presence of BDA-366, WT
but not the ΔBH3 mutant Bcl2 can activate Bax via 6A7 conformational change in a cellfree system (Figure 3B). To test this at the cellular or mitochondrial level, WT, ΔBH3 Bcl2
mutant and empty vector (pCIneo) were transfected into H1299 cells that express
undetectable levels of endogenous Bcl2 but high levels of endogenous Bax (Figure 3C).
Cells or isolated mitochondria from these cells were treated with BDA-366, followed by IP
with Bcl2 BH3 or 6A7 antibody, respectively. Results indicate that BDA-366 induced Bcl2
conformational change in association with Bax activation in cells or isolated mitochondria
containing WT Bcl2 but not in cells or isolated mitochondria expressing ΔBH3 Bcl2 mutant
or vector-only control (Figures 3D and S3A). These results suggest that exposure of Bcl2

BH3 domain induced by BDA-366 is required for BDA-366 activation of Bax in cells or
isolated mitochondria. To further test whether BDA-366 induces Cyt c release from
mitochondria in a Bcl2 dependent fashion, mitochondria were isolated from H1299 cells
expressing WT, ΔBH3 mutant Bcl2 or vector-only control. The isolated mitochondria were
treated with BDA-366 (1μM) for 30 min at 30°C. After centrifugation, Cyt c in the
supernatant (i.e. Cyt c release) was analyzed by Western blot. Results reveal that BDA-366
induced Cyt c release from the mitochondria isolated from WT Bcl2 but not from ΔBH3 and
vector-only control cells (Figure 3E). This indicates that BDA-366-induced Cyt c release
occurs in a Bcl2-dependent fashion, which also requires the BH3 domain in Bcl2.
BDA-366 induces apoptotic cell death in a Bax-dependent manner

Author Manuscript

Our findings above reveal that the BDA-366-induced conformationally changed Bcl2 (i.e.
with exposed BH3 domain) can activate Bax (Figures 2 and 3). To further determine
whether Bax is essential for BDA-366 induction of apoptosis, we tested the apoptotic effect
of BDA-366 on wild type (WT) and Bax knockout (Bax−/−) MEF cells. Intriguingly, Bax
deficient MEF cells were significantly resistant to BDA-366 as compared to WT MEF cells
(Figures S3B and S3C), indicating that activation of Bax by conformationally changed Bcl2
may be an essential step for the eventual induction of apoptosis by BDA-366.
BDA-366 induces calcium (Ca2+) release via inhibition of Bcl2/IP3R interaction

Author Manuscript

Bcl2 has been reported to inhibit Ca2+-driven apoptosis by direct interaction with the
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor via the BH4 domain (Monaco et al., 2012; Rong
et al., 2009). Disruption of BH4/IP3R association by synthetic BH4 binding peptide resulted
in increased Ca2+ release and apoptosis (Rong et al., 2008; Zhong et al., 2011). To test
whether BDA-366/BH4 binding affects the IP3R/Bcl2 interaction and Ca2+ release, H460
cells were treated with increasing concentrations of BDA-366 for 24h. Results reveal that
BDA-366 reduced Bcl2/IP3R binding in association with increased Ca2+ release (Figures
S3D and S3E). These findings may uncover an additional mechanism by which BDA-366
induces apoptosis in a BH4 binding-dependent manner.
BDA-366 induces autophagic cell death of human lung cancer cells

Author Manuscript

It is well known that Bcl2 directly interacts with Beclin-1 and suppresses Beclin-1dependent autophagy (Pattingre et al., 2005). Inhibition of Bcl2 by ABT-737 not only
induces apoptosis but also autophagy (Maiuri et al., 2007). Importantly, a recent report
indicates that removal of the BH4 domain from Bcl2 protein promotes an autophagic
process that impairs tumor growth (Trisciuoglio et al., 2013). To test whether disruption of
Bcl2 BH4 by BDA-366 stimulates autophagy, H460 cells were treated with BDA-366 (1
μM) for 24h. Increased levels of LC3-II were observed after treatment with BDA-366
(Figure S3F). To further quantify the level of autophagy, a GFP-LC3 construct was used to
indicate autophagosomes as described (Liang et al., 2006; Maiuri et al., 2007). After
treatment with BDA-366, GFP-LC3 redistributes from a diffuse staining pattern in the
cytoplasm and nucleus to a cytoplasmic punctate structure that specifically labels preautophagosomal and autophagosomal membranes (i.e. GFP-LC3 vac cells) (Figure S3G).
Treatment of cells with BDA-366 significantly increases the percentage of GFP-LC3vac

cells as compared to DMSO control (Figure S3H). These findings reveal that, in addition to
apoptosis, BDA-366 may also stimulate autophagic cell death by inhibiting Bcl2 activity in
human lung cancer cells.
BDA-366 suppresses lung cancer growth via induction of apoptosis in animal models

Author Manuscript

In order to define the appropriate doses for in vivo experimentation, we first determined the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as previously described (Park et al., 2013). Nu/Nu nude
mice were treated in groups of 6 per dose level with increasing doses of BDA-366 (10–
50mg/kg/d) intraperitoneally (i.p.) for up to 12 days. Doses of 40 and 50mg/kg/d were
uniformly lethal in the 6 mice within 8 or 12 days, respectively (Figure 4A). The dose range
between 10 and 30mg/kg/d was tolerable with no death recorded for up to 12 days of daily
administration (Figure 4A). To uncover the mechanism of lethality, in addition to 12-day
treatment at the MTD as shown in Figure 4A, we also measured standard single-dose MTD
treatment in normal C57BL/6 mice as described (Hamblett et al., 2004). Treatment of mice
with a single dose of 300mg/kg i.p. did not cause weight loss or other toxicities, including
hematologic, liver and kidney functions (Figures S4A, S4B and S4C). However, a single
dose of 400mg/kg resulted in death of mice in 4 days. Both ALT and AST were significantly
enhanced (Figures S4A and S4B). Pathological analysis for all organs indicated
microsteatosis in the liver and atrophic white pulp in the spleen (Figure S4C). Based on
these findings, mice might die mainly from liver damage at a single 400mg/kg dose. Thus,
the single dose MTD of BDA-366 should range from 300–400 mg/kg. 10% of single dose
MTD can usually be considered as the maximum therapeutic dose (30~40mg/kg) for
continuous treatment. We therefore considered doses between 10 and 30mg/kg/d to be
relatively safe.

To test the potency of BDA-366 in vivo, lung cancer xenografts derived from H460 cells
were treated with increasing doses (0, 10, 20, 30mg/kg/d) of BDA-366 via i.p. for 14 days.
Results show that treatment of mice with BDA-366 resulted in a dose-dependent repression
of lung cancer in vivo (Figure 4B). To assess whether BDA-366 induced suppression of
tumor growth via apoptosis in vivo, representative samples from harvested tumor tissues
were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for active caspase 3 or TUNEL assay as
described (Hao et al., 2012; Oltersdorf et al., 2005). A dose-dependent apoptosis induction
was observed in tumor tissues after BDA-366 treatment (Figure 4C). Importantly, doses of
10–30mg/kg/d not only potently suppressed tumor growth but were also well tolerated
without significant toxicity to mice. Slight weight loss was observed in mice treated with the
dose of 30mg/kg but there were no decreases in neutrophils, lymphocytes, red blood cells
(RBC) and platelets (PLT) in blood. Tests of kidney (BUN) and liver (ALT and AST)
function were in the normal range (Figures S4D and S4E). Histopathology of harvested
normal tissues (heart, liver, lung, brain, spleen, kidney, intestine, etc.) revealed no evidence
of normal tissue toxicities after treatment with doses of 10–30mg/kg/d (Figure S4F). These
findings suggest that doses between 10mg/kg and 30mg/kg provide the optimal therapeutic
index for BDA-366 for in vivo experimentation involving lung cancer xenografts.
In addition to NSCLC cell lines, BDA-366 also efficiently suppressed growth of SCLC cell
lines (Figure 1). To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of BDA-366 against SCLC in vivo, we

established patient-derived xenografts (PDX), without intervening in vitro culture, which are
expected to better recapitulate the SCLC tumor setting. We tested the potency of BDA-366
(20mg/kg/d) administered for 2 weeks in a PDX obtained from a patient with refractory
SCLC. Intriguingly, BDA-366 potently suppressed the growth of the SCLC PDX, which
occurred through apoptosis in tumor tissues (Figure 5). These findings indicate that
BDA-366 may potentially be effective in patients with SCLC where there are currently
limited treatment options.
BDA-366 induces Bcl2 conformational change in tumor tissues

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Quantum dot-based immunohistofluorescence (QD-IHF) technology has recently been
developed as a valuable tool for simultaneous and concurrent immunostaining of multiple
biomarkers in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, thereby allowing for
quantification of several biomarkers simultaneously on the same tissue slide (Li et al.,
2013). To determine whether BDA-366 induces Bcl2 conformation change by exposure of
its BH3 domain in tumor tissues and whether the BH3 domain-exposed Bcl2 activates Bax,
conformational changes in both Bcl2 and Bax were simultaneously analyzed by QD-IHF on
the same tissue slide. The antibody 6A7 can selectively recognize Bax after the
conformational change associated with membrane insertion that occurs in apoptotic cells
(Hsu et al., 1997; Hsu and Youle, 1998). QD images showed that treatment of H460
xenograft mice with BDA-366 for 14 days resulted in a dose-dependent exposure of the
Bcl2 BH3 domain in tumor tissues (Figure 6). Intriguingly, BDA-366-induced Bcl2
conformational change was associated with an increased level of 6A7 binding to Bax (i.e. an
increase in the level of the active form of Bax; Figure 6), suggesting that the BH3-exposed
Bcl2 may activate Bax leading to apoptosis in tumor tissues (Figure 4C). There were no
significant changes in total Bcl2 and Bax levels in tumor tissues after BDA-366 treatment
(Figure S5).
mTOR inhibition up-regulates Bcl2 in lung cancer cell lines and in tumor tissues from
patients with NSCLC

Author Manuscript

Rapamycin and its derivative RAD001 (i.e. everolimus) are potent allosteric inhibitors of
mTOR (Legrier et al., 2007). RAD001 is well tolerated but shows limited antitumor activity
in patients with lung cancer (Besse et al., 2014; Ramalingam et al., 2013; Tarhini et al.,
2010). Previous reports indicate that expression of Bcl2 is associated with resistance of
cancer cells to mTOR inhibitors (Aguirre et al., 2004; Majumder et al., 2004). To further test
whether mTOR inhibition regulates Bcl2 expression, A549 and H460 cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of RAD001 for 24 hr. Inhibition of mTOR by RAD001 resulted in
up-regulation of Bcl2 in a dose-dependent manner in both A549 and H460 lung cancer cells
(Figure 7A). To test whether a similar effect of RAD001 on Bcl2 expression occurs in
patients, we analyzed Bcl2 expression by IHC in baseline and post-treatment tissue samples
obtained from 10 NSCLC patients treated with RAD001 (5 or 10mg/day) for 28 days as part
of a neoadjuvant clinical study of everolimus in patients with resectable NSCLC
(Owonikoko et al., 2015). There was increased expression of Bcl2 in post-treatment tumor
tissues compared to baseline samples (Figure 7B). These findings suggest that up-regulation
of Bcl2 by mTOR inhibition may negatively affect the sensitivity of lung cancer to mTOR

inhibitor. Thus, inhibition of Bcl2 may enhance the potency of mTOR inhibitor against lung
cancer.
BDA-366 synergizes with mTOR inhibitor in suppression of lung cancer in vitro and in vivo

Author Manuscript

To test whether combined Bcl2 and mTOR inhibition shows the predicted synergistic
activity against lung cancer cells, H460 cells were treated with BDA-366 (100nM), RAD001
(1nM) or the combination. SRB assay showed that either RAD001 or BDA-366 alone
partially inhibited lung cancer cell growth. Intriguingly, the combination of RAD001 and
BDA-366 resulted in significantly more growth inhibition (Figure S6A), indicating that
combined Bcl2 and mTOR inhibition has greater activity than either single agent alone in
inhibiting lung cancer cell growth. To more accurately analyze the degree of synergy
between RAD001 and BDA-366, a combination index (CI) value was calculated as
described in “Supplemental Experimental Procedures”. The CI value was less than 0.3 (i.e.
0.278), indicating that RAD001 and BDA-366 exhibit strong synergistic growth inhibition
of lung cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

To test whether co-targeting Bcl2 and mTOR also synergistically represses lung cancer in
vivo, mice with NSCLC (i.e. H460) xenografts were treated with RAD001 (1mg/kg/d),
BDA-366 (15mg/kg/d) or the combination for 14 days. Intriguingly, the combination of
BDA-366 and RAD001 exhibited a significantly greater efficacy than BDA-366 or RAD001
alone in suppressing lung tumor growth in vivo (Figure 8A), leading to sustained tumor
repression. One of the 6 tumor-bearing mice treated with combined BDA-366 and RAD001
achieved complete tumor regression, which is still persisting as of the time of euthanization
(4 months from the end of treatment on day 14). Importantly, RAD001 alone did not cause
significant apoptosis in tumor tissues but significantly enhanced the apoptosis induced by
BDA-366 in tumor tissues (Figure 8B). No weight loss or organ toxicities were observed in
mice with these treatments, including combined treatment (Figures 8C, D and S6B).

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Bcl2 is a major antiapoptotic Bcl2 family member that is directly involved in the
suppression of apoptosis at the decision stage (Deng et al., 2006). Mimicking the BH3
domain to induce apoptosis has recently been used as a strategy for the development of Bcl2
inhibitors as anticancer drugs (Chonghaile and Letai, 2008; Kang and Reynolds, 2009;
Oltersdorf et al., 2005). The BH3 mimetic agents function as competitive inhibitors by
binding to the hydrophobic cleft of Bcl2/Bcl-XL (Chonghaile and Letai, 2008; Oltersdorf et
al., 2005). Four Bcl2 inhibitors, including oblimersen sodium (G3139), gossypol (AT-101),
obatoclax (GX15-070) and ABT-263, have already been tested in human clinical trials but
showed limited clinical efficacy (Chonghaile and Letai, 2008; Kang and Reynolds, 2009).
The BH4 domain is required for the survival activity of Bcl2, and removal of this domain
can convert Bcl2 from a survival to a killer molecule (Cheng et al., 1997), suggesting that
the BH4 domain constitutes a promising structure-based target for the disruption of Bcl2’s
survival function or conversion of Bcl2 into a death molecule. In this study, we have
identified a class of Bcl2 antagonist (i.e. BDA-366) that targets the BH4 domain and is
distinct from previous BH3 mimetics. BDA-366 directly binds to purified Bcl2 protein

selectively at the BH4 domain with high affinity, with an inhibitory constant (Ki) value at
the nanomolar level. BDA-366 failed to bind other Bcl2 family members (i.e. Bcl-XL,
Mcl-1 and Bfl-1/A1), demonstrating the specificity of Bcl2/BDA-366 binding. The binding
of BDA-366 with the BH4 domain resulted in Bcl2 conformational change and exposure of
the BH3 domain in vitro and in vivo. This conformational change could activate Bax in a
cell-free system and also in tumor tissues, suggesting that it is likely responsible for the
death-inducing effect of BDA-336. These findings suggest a mechanistic model of using a
small molecule inhibitor to convert an antiapoptotic Bcl2 family member(s) into a death
molecule.

Author Manuscript

The multi-domain proapoptotic Bax provides the required gateway to apoptotic cell death
(Wei et al., 2001). Since BDA-366 is dependent on Bax for apoptosis induction, this
suggests its mechanism of action may be predominantly through the Bcl2 family. However,
direct activation of Bax appears unlikely because BDA-366 failed to induce Bax
conformational change in vitro.
BDA-366 demonstrated potent antitumor activity in lung cancer xenografts derived from
either a lung cancer cell line or a patient-derived SCLC tumor. We determined the MTD of
BDA-366 with a 12-day treatment to be between 30 and 40 mg/kg/d. Dose-response
experiments revealed that doses of BDA-366 between 10 and 30mg/kg/d potently suppress
lung cancer growth in vivo without platelet reduction or other significant normal tissue
toxicity, indicating that this dose range should be effective and safe in murine lung cancer
models. Since BDA-366 effectively suppressed the growth of PDX raised from a patient
with refractory SCLC, there is a good possibility that BDA-366 may provide clinical utility
in patients in the future.

Author Manuscript

Cancer cells overexpressing Bcl2 are resistant to mTOR inhibitor and down-regulation of
Bcl2 restores sensitivity to mTOR inhibition (Aguirre et al., 2004; Majumder et al., 2004).
Here, we discovered that inhibition of mTOR by RAD001 resulted in Bcl2 up-regulation in
lung cancer cell lines and in tumor tissues from NSCLC patients treated with RAD001. It is
possible that Bcl2 expression induced by mTOR inhibitor therapy may negatively affect the
efficacy of mTOR inhibitor in lung therapy. This may help explain why RAD001 only had
limited efficacy in lung cancer patients (Ramalingam et al., 2013; Tarhini et al., 2010). Our
findings provide a strong rationale to propose that combined Bcl2 and mTOR inhibition
should have superior therapeutic benefits over each agent alone. As expected, BDA-366 in
combination with RAD001 exhibited strong synergistic activity against lung cancer in vitro
and in vivo without significant normal tissue toxicity. Based on our data, we propose that cotargeting Bcl2 and mTOR offers a more effective strategy for lung cancer treatment.

Author Manuscript

In summary, we have identified a class of Bcl2 antagonist (BDA-366) that selectively
targets the BH4 domain of Bcl2. The binding of BDA-366 with the BH4 domain results in
conversion of Bcl2 from an antiapoptotic molecule into a death protein through a
conformational change that exposes its BH3 death domain. The BH4 antagonist BDA-366
exhibits potent efficacy against human lung cancer in vivo without platelet reduction.
Development of the BH4 antagonist as a class of anti-cancer agent offers additional strategy
for lung cancer therapy.

Supplementary Experimental Procedures.
Cell lines and cell culture

Author Manuscript

Normal small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) and lung cancer cell lines were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). SAEC cells were cultured in
small airway epithelial growth media (SAGM™ BulletKit®, ATCC). NSCLC cell lines (i.e.
H157, H358, H460, HCC827, H292, H1299, H1975 and Calu-1) were maintained in RPMI
1640 with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% bovine serum. A549 cells were cultured in F-12K
medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. WT and Bcl2 BH deletion mutants (i.e. ΔBH1,
ΔBH2, ΔBH3 and ΔBH4) were created and stably expressed in H1299 cells as we previously
described (Hou et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008). SCLC cell lines DMS53, DMS114,
DMS153, H128, H146 and H69 were cultured in Weymouth’s medium supplemented with
5% FBS and 5% bovine serum (BS) as described (Park et al., 2013). Wild type and Bax
knockout (Bax−/−) MEF cells were obtained from Dr. Douglas R. Green (St Jude Children’s
Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) and maintained in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine
serum.
Human patient samples from clinical trial and establishment of patient-derived xenografts

Author Manuscript

Informed consent was obtained from all human subjects, and use of human samples for
immunohistochemistry and patient-derived xenograft was approved by the institutional
review board (IRB) of Emory University. Paired samples of NSCLC tissues were collected
as part of a completed phase IB clinical trial evaluating the pharmacodynamic effects of
RAD001 in adult patients with resectable NSCLC. Enrolled eligible patients received
RAD001 (5 or10mg) orally once daily for 28 days (Owonikoko et al., 2015). Pretreatment
biopsy samples and post treatment surgical resection specimens were analyzed for Bcl2
expression. Patient-derived xenograft was obtained as part of an IRB-approved phase II coclinical trial of arsenic trioxide in patients with relapsed SCLC who have failed standard
platinum-based chemotherapy. Tumor samples were obtained by image guided biopsy and
were directly implanted into Nu/Nu nude mice without intervening propagation in plastic
culture plates. Direct serial propagation of growing tumor occurred for up to 5 generations.
The animal propagation protocol was approved by the Emory IACUC and the Emory
Animal Ethics Committee.
Treatment of lung cancer xenografts

Author Manuscript

Lung cancer xenografts were generated as described as previously (Park et al., 2013). 6week-old male Nu/Nu nude mice were purchased from Harlan and housed under pathogenfree conditions in microisolator cages. All animal treatments were undertaken in accordance
with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at
Emory University. 3×106 lung cancer H460 cells were injected into subcutaneous tissue in
the flank region of nude mice. The tumors were allowed to grow to an average volume of
~250 mm3 prior to initiation of therapy as described (Oltersdorf et al., 2005). Mice with lung
cancer xenografts were treated with BDA-366, RAD001 or the combination

intraperitoneally (i.p.) at the indicated dose. During treatment, tumor volume (V) was
measured by caliper measurements once every 2 days and calculated with the formula:
V=(LxW2)/2 (L: length; W: width) as described (Park et al., 2013). At the end of
experiments, mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. Harvested tumor tissues were used
for further analysis.
Statistical analysis
The statistical significance of differences between groups was analyzed with two-sided
unpaired student’s t-test or Fisher’s exact test. Results were considered statistically
significant at p<0.05. The IC50 values were calculated using SPSS Statistics software 18
(IBM). All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.).

SIGNIFICANCE
Here we report a small molecule (BDA-366) that selectively targets the BH4 domain of
Bcl2 and converts Bcl2 from a survival molecule to a cell death inducer through a
conformational change. Our results provide mechanistic insights into Bcl2 conversion by
BDA-366 and illuminate a direction for the development of BH4-based anticancer
agents. The inhibition of mTOR by RAD001 up-regulates Bcl2 in vitro and in vivo.
Accordingly, a synergistic anti-tumor effect through combined treatment with BDA-366
and RAD001 was observed in vitro and in vivo. This study has significant translational
value and may foster more effective strategy against lung cancer.
