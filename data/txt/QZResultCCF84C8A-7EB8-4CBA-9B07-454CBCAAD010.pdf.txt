Abstract
In this study, we investigated the precursor and active forms of
a p53 small-molecule inhibitor for their effects on temozolomide (TMZ) antitumor activity against glioblastoma (GBM),
using both in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches.
Results from in vitro cell viability analysis showed that the
cytotoxic activity of TMZ was substantially increased when
p53 wild-type (p53wt) GBMs were cotreated with the active
form of p53 inhibitor, and this heightened cytotoxic response
was accompanied by increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
cleavage as well as elevated cellular phospho-H2AX. Analysis
of the same series of GBMs, as intracranial xenografts in
athymic mice, and administering corresponding p53 inhibitor
precursor, which is converted to the active compound in vivo,
yielded results consistent with the in vitro analyses: TMZ + p53
inhibitor precursor cotreatment of three distinct p53wt GBM
xenografts resulted in significant enhancement of TMZ
antitumor effect relative to treatment with TMZ alone, as
indicated by serial bioluminescence monitoring as well as
survival analysis (P < 0.001 for cotreatment survival benefit
in each case). Mice receiving intracranial injection with p53null
GBM showed similar survival benefit from TMZ treatment
regardless of the presence or absence of p53 inhibitor
precursor. In total, our results indicate that the p53 active
and precursor inhibitor pair enhances TMZ cytotoxicity
in vitro and in vivo, respectively, and do so in a p53-dependent
manner. [Cancer Res 2008;68(24):10034–9]

Introduction
Attempts and approaches at manipulating p53 activity in
treating human cancer have been numerous and diverse. For
example, viral-mediated introduction and expression of wild-type
(wt) TP53 in p53-defective tumor cells has been extensively
investigated for more than a decade, including through clinical
trial activity (1). Alternative approaches for increasing tumor cell
wt p53 activity include the use of small molecules that promote p53
transcription and the use of compounds that inhibit p53
interaction with murine double minute 2 (2).

Perhaps because of it being counter to conventional thinking
about the role of tumor suppressor genes in cancer etiology, as
well as being counterintuitive about the way in which tumor
suppressor genes are viewed in relation to the treatment of cancer,
there has been relatively little research directed toward the
development of antitumor therapeutic strategies that include a
p53 inhibitory component. Indeed, as a monotherapy, such a
treatment approach could promote increased tumor cell proliferation and decreased tumor cell apoptosis. However, the potential
consequences of attempted cell cycling by tumor cells with
damaged DNA, resulting from genotoxic therapy with concurrent
inhibition of p53, are interesting to consider. In fact, results from
several studies involving in vitro investigation of tumor cell lines
support enhanced cytotoxic chemotherapeutic response in association with p53 inhibition (3–6). Furthermore, with respect to
GBM, the p53 small-molecule inhibitor pifithrin-a, which was
identified nearly a decade ago in association with a chemical
library screen (7), has been shown to enhance the in vitro
cytotoxic effect of temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA alkylator, as well
as the cytotoxic effect of chloroethylating nitrosoureas such as
carmustine (8, 9).
In addition to reasons described above, in vivo investigation of
p53 small-molecule inhibitors, as part of a cancer treatment
strategy, has been hindered due to limitations imposed by physical
properties of the pifithrin-a reference compound (10). Recently,
however, derivatives of the reference compound were described
with respect to their potential in vivo use (11). In the current study,
we have tested one of these compounds, using an intracranial GBM
xenograft therapy-response model, and present results indicating
its enhancement of TMZ antitumor activity in vivo and in a
manner that is dependent on tumor cell p53 status.

Materials and Methods
In vitro experiments. GBM xenografts used in this study have previously
been described (12, 13), as has the modification of xenografts for
bioluminescence imaging (13). Xenograft cells were cultured as nonadherent neurospheres in neurobasal media (Invitrogen), whereas U87 cells
(American Type Culture Collection) were propagated as monolayer cultures
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Temozolomide (TMZ; obtained as
Temodar from Schering-Plough) and active-form p53 inhibitor (cyclic
pifithrin-a p-nitro, Calbiochem) were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) as
20 and 5 mmol/L stock solutions, respectively. For bioluminescence viability
analysis, cells were treated with DMSO, TMZ (added to concentrations of
50 or 100 Amol/L), p53 inhibitor (concentration of 10 Amol/L), or a
combination of TMZ and p53 inhibitor, with chemical agents added to
media once a day for 3 consecutive days. Cell culture specimens were
examined for bioluminescence signal using a Xenogen imaging system
(Caliper Life Sciences), following the addition of 25 AL of 20 mg/mL sodium
luciferin (Gold Biotechnology) in PBS (Invitrogen).

p53 Inhibitor Enhances Temozolomide Cytotoxicity
Flow cytometry cell cycle analysis. U87 cells were treated once a day
for 3 d with DMSO only, 10 Amol/L p53 inhibitor, 50 or 100 Amol/L TMZ, or
50 or 100 Amol/L TMZ + 10 Amol/L p53-inhibitor. At 1, 4, and 7 d after final
treatment, the cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and fixed with cold
70% ethanol. Cells were stained with propidium iodide and examined by
flow cytometry (BD LSR II, Becton-Dickinson), with results analyzed using
FlowJo software.
Immunoblot analysis. Primary antibodies used for immunoblot analysis
(previously described; see ref. 13) were for detection of poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (Cell Signaling Tech), phospho-histone H2AX (Cell Signaling
Tech), p53 (Sigma-Aldrich), p21 (Santa Cruz Biotech), MGMT (R&D
Systems), or h-tubulin (Millipore). Secondary antibodies used were antimouse or antirabbit (Cell Signaling Tech) or antigoat (Santa Cruz Biotech).
Methylation-specific PCR. Analysis of MGMT promoter methylation
was as described by Esteller and colleagues(14). PCR products were resolved
in 4.5% agarose gels (NuSieve 3:1, Lonza, Inc.) and were subsequently
stained with ethidium bromide.
In vivo experiments. Procedures used for intracranial tumor therapyresponse experiments, including monitoring of tumor growth and response
to therapy by bioluminescence imaging, have previously been described
(13). Treatment groups for the experiments reported here were as follows: 3
d i.p. DMSO and oral suspension vehicle (OraPlus, Paddock Laboratories) by
gavage (control group); 3 d 10 mg/kg TMZ in oral suspension vehicle for
GBM 12, GBM 14, and U87, and 50 mg/kg for GBM 26; 3 d 0.25 mg p53
inhibitor precursor (pifithrin-a p-nitro, Calbiochem) in DMSO by i.p.
injection; or 3 d combination TMZ and p53 inhibitor as indicated for their
administration as single agents.

To further evaluate cyclic pifithrin-a p-nitro for in vitro activity,
as well as to contrast results from the use of this compound with
those previously reported for the pifithrin-a reference compound
(Supplementary Fig. S1C; see ref. 8), U87 cells were incubated with
TMZ +/ cyclic pifithrin-a p-nitro and examined by flow
cytometric cell cycle analysis. Similar to results reported for the
reference compound (8), higher sub-G1 cell fractions were observed
in samples treated with TMZ + cyclic pifithrin-a p-nitro, relative to
TMZ treatment alone. Sub-G1 ratios for U87 cells subjected to

Results
GBM xenograft explant cultures were incubated with TMZ +/
cyclic pifithrin-a p-nitro (Supplementary Fig. S1: see ref. 11) to
assess the in vitro effects of this p53 inhibitor on tumor cell TMZ
cytotoxic response. Results for p53wt GBM 26 showed substantial
decreases in viable cell number resulting from TMZ + p53 inhibitor
cotreatments, in relation to cells treated with TMZ alone (Fig. 1A
and B). Importantly, cyclic pifithrin-a p-nitro alone showed no
antitumor effect. In contrast to the results for GBM 26, GBM 12
cells, which express no endogenous p53 (p53null: see ref. 12),
showed similar cytotoxic response to TMZ irrespective of the
presence or absence of the p53 inhibitor (Fig. 1C). As shown by
others (11), cyclic pifithrin-a p-nitro inhibits DNA damage–
associated induction of the negative cell cycle regulator p21, but
only in p53wt cells (Fig. 1D). In addition, and consistent with the
p53 small-molecule inhibitor treatments, pretreating cells with p53
siRNA enhanced the TMZ cytotoxic response of GBM 26 cells,
relative to pretreating cells with nonspecific siRNA, whereas GBM
12 cells responded similarly to TMZ whether preincubated with
p53 or nonspecific siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Figure 1. In vitro cell viability analysis of GBM xenograft explant cultures
subjected to TMZ +/ p53 inhibitor treatments. A, GBM 26 cells were treated
with TMZ only (black ) at the indicated concentrations or with TMZ + 10 Amol/L
cyclic pifithrin-a p-nitro (gray ). Treatments were administered once a day for
3 consecutive days (each treatment group consisting of triplicate samples); 4 d
following final treatment, the luminescence of each treatment group was
determined (B ). Columns, average values for each treatment group; bars, SE.

experimental design as described for GBM 26 was used for assessing p53null
GBM 12 cell response to treatments, with results presented as indicated for A.
D, immunoblot results for p21 expression in cells treated with TMZ +/ p53
inhibitor (p53i ). TMZ (100 Amol/L) induces p21 expression in p53wt cells (GBM
26), and this induction is suppressed through concurrent treatment with p53
inhibitor (incubations as described for A and C ). In contrast to the results for
GBM 26, p21 is not detected in p53null GBM 12 cells, irrespective of treatment
(shown) or lack of treatment with TMZ. Replicate samples for this analysis
yielded similar results.

cotreatment versus treatment with 100 Amol/L TMZ only were
1.97, 2.25, and 1.54 at days 1, 4, and 7 following final treatment,
respectively (Fig. 2A and B). Consistent with the GBM xenograft
explant culture cytotoxic response results described above (Fig. 1),

results from U87 flow cytometry analysis showed little difference in
cell cycle distributions between U87 treated with cyclic pifithrin-a
p-nitro and mock-treated control cells (Fig. 2A).
Immunoblot analysis of U87 cells incubated with TMZ +/
cyclic pifithrin-a p-nitro showed increased poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase cleavage resulting from combined treatment, in
comparison with cells treated with the same concentration of
TMZ alone (Fig. 2C), thereby suggesting increased caspase activity
in association with the enhanced cytotoxic response to TMZ + p53
inhibitor. Heightened apoptotic response to combination treatment was also indicated by increased phospho-H2AX in cells
incubated with TMZ + p53 inhibitor, relative to cells incubated
with the same concentration of TMZ alone. Levels of p53 protein
were similar between culture treatments (Fig. 2C), consistent with
the inhibitory activity of pifithrin-a compounds involving suppression of existing p53 activity, rather than suppression of p53
expression.
Previous study of pifithrin-a p-nitro derivatives has revealed that
2-aminothiazole salt cyclization (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B)
is required for the formation of active p53 inhibitor, and that this
cyclization occurs spontaneously in vivo, albeit over a period of
several hours (11). Because active-form p53 inhibitors have
relatively short half-lives in vivo, it has been suggested that the
kinetics of inactive, open-form precursor conversion to
corresponding cyclized, active-form compound can be used to
advantage for achieving prolonged cell exposure to active state
inhibitors in vivo and thereby achieve prolonged p53 inhibitory
effect (11). In accord with this line of reasoning, we investigated the
open-form precursor of cyclic pifithrin-a p-nitro (Supplementary
Fig. S1A) for effect on TMZ in vivo antitumor activity, using a
previously described intracranial GBM xenograft therapy-response
model (13). Mice injected with p53wt tumor cells (GBM 14, GBM 26,
and U87) or with cells from p53null GBM 12 were monitored for
luminescence increases indicative of log-phase growth of injected
cells, at which time TMZ (gavage) and p53 inhibitor precursor
(i.p. injection) were administered singularly or concurrently once a
day for 3 consecutive days (treatment periods indicated by vertical
gray columns, Fig. 3A and B). For mice injected with p53wt GBM,

Figure 2. Flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis of U87 cells subjected to
TMZ +/ cyclic pifithrin-a p -nitro inhibitor treatments. A, cell treatments were as
follows: control, DMSO only; p53 inhibitor only, 10 Amol/L cyclic pifithrin-a p -nitro
administered daily for 3 consecutive days; TMZ only, 50 or 100 Amol/L TMZ
administered daily for 3 consecutive days; TMZ + p53 inhibitor, 50 or 100 Amol/L
TMZ + 10 Amol/L p53 inhibitor administered daily for 3 consecutive days. Cells
were harvested from individual plates on the days indicated (values represent
days following final treatment administration) and prepared for flow cytometry
analysis. Associated flow cytometry profiles show similar amounts of and
predominant G1 phase cell fractions in control and p53 inhibitor only samples at
each time point, whereas time-dependent increases in proportion of sub-G1 cell
fractions are evident in the TMZ only and the TMZ + p53 inhibitor series
(black lines beneath each column of profiles indicate, from left to right, the
positions of the sub-G1, G1, and G2-M cell fractions). Results shown are for
100 Amol/L TMZ treatments. B, bar graph showing sub-G1 ratios for TMZ + p53

cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP ), presence or absence of
phospho-H2AX, and relative amounts of p53 protein; each tubulin result is
presented beneath the corresponding result obtained from the same filter, and
addresses total protein loading variation. Note the lack of effect of TMZ on p53
expression (middle and far right lanes of p53 immunoblot), which is consistently
observed in tumors expressing p53.

survival was significantly extended by combined TMZ + p53
inhibitor treatment, relative to TMZ treatment alone, and this
effect was observed for three p53wt tumors (P < 0.001 for each;
Fig. 3A ; Table 1). Survival benefits were consistent with
corresponding results from bioluminescence monitoring, which
revealed prolonged decrease of p53wt intracranial tumor luminescence in mice receiving TMZ + p53 inhibitor (Fig. 3B). It is worth
noting that p53 inhibitor precursor enhancement of TMZ
cytotoxicity was observed irrespective of p53wt GBM sensitivity to
TMZ alone, as TMZ-resistant GBM 26, with unmethylated MGMT
promoter and highly expressed MGMT protein, and GBM 14 and
U87, in which MGMT promoter methylation is accompanied by a
lack of detectable MGMT protein (Fig. 3C and D), all showed
significantly increased response to combination treatment. Conversely, mice with p53null GBM 12 intracranial tumor did not
experience significant survival benefit from combined TMZ + p53
inhibitor precursor treatment in comparison with mice receiving
treatment with TMZ only (Fig. 3A; Table 1).

Discussion
Research for examining potential clinical applications of p53
small-molecule inhibitors has often involved experimental paradigms that address the protection of normal cells, rather than
determining effects on tumor cell response to therapy that includes
p53 inhibition. Specifically, there is considerable interest about
whether p53 small-molecule inhibitors can be used to spare normal
cells from p53-mediated apoptosis that occurs from oxidative
stress during stroke, renal injury, or cardiac arrest (15), as well as
from the genotoxic effects of cancer treatments (7). Small-molecule
inhibition of p53 in tumor cells, for enhancing the anticancer
effects of therapy, has not attracted much attention, although there
is ample related evidence in support of this concept. This support,
however, primarily stems from the use of viral gene product
expression (4) and RNA interference (3, 6) to suppress tumor cell
p53 function, and the perspective of the associated studies has
been to investigate the role of p53 as a determinant of tumor cell
response to cytotoxic therapy, rather than to pursue p53 as a target
for augmenting the effects of therapy.
In the current study, we have contrasted p53wt versus p53null
GBM xenograft response to cytotoxic therapy that includes the use
of a small-molecule inhibitor of p53. Significantly extended survival

www.aacrjournals.org

benefit from combination therapy was evident among a series of
mice with intracranial p53wt GBM, whereas mice with intracranial
p53null GBM did not experience survival benefit from combination
therapy. The issue about the response of p53 missense mutants to
p53 inhibitor treatment is complex due to the diversity of p53
mutations in human cancer, the distinct transcriptional effects of
individual p53 mutations, and the transcription-independent
cellular activities of mutant p53 (16–18). Current studies are in
progress to address the variability of p53 missense mutant GBM
response to p53 inhibitor–augmented cytotoxic therapy.
There are numerous candidates to consider as mediators of p53
inhibitor–enhanced cytotoxic response, with our results currently
supporting more extensive investigation of p53 inhibitor–mediated
suppression of p21 (Fig. 1D), as well as investigation of apoptotic
response effectors that are inferred by our preliminary results
(Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S3). There are, of course, additional
aspects of this cytotoxic response to be investigated, one of which
is indicated in a recent report showing that p53 inhibition can
suppress TMZ-associated induction of MGMT (19). In the case of
the tumor cell sources used here, this could be a contributing
factor associated with p53 inhibitor enhancement of TMZ
cytotoxicity against GBM 26, for which MGMT is unmethylated
and expressed, but is probably less likely for GBM 14 and U87
tumors, for which MGMT is presumably silenced through MGMT
promoter methylation (Fig. 3C and D).
In addition to investigating the molecular biology of pathways
and proteins associated with enhanced TMZ cytotoxic effect
through concurrent p53 inhibition, the identification of surrogate
markers that can be used to assess p53 inhibitor activity in tumors
is critically important. The ability to analyze tumors for temporal
variations in the expression and/or activity of biomarkers that
respond to p53 inhibition, in combination with corresponding
analysis of tumor extracts for temporal variations in p53 inhibitor
content (e.g., through use of high-performance liquid chromatography), will provide key information about inhibitor pharmacodynamics for optimizing combination therapy dosing and sequencing.
Results presented here provide some basis for considering the
subgroup of GBM that would benefit from therapy that includes
p53 inhibition. As concerns this point, it is significant that p53
inhibition enhances TMZ cytotoxicity in p53wt tumors irrespective
of their sensitivity to TMZ monotherapy. Consequently, this
therapeutic approach could conceivably benefit the two thirds of

Figure 3. Intracranial xenograft therapy response to TMZ +/ p53 inhibitor precursor treatments. Groups of 32 mice received intracranial tumor cell injection
(300,000 cells per mouse) using luciferase-modified GBM, and at times when log-phase growth was indicated by bioluminescence imaging (BLI ), each series of mice
was randomized into four treatment groups with eight mice per group, and treatments were initiated. Treatment groups were as follows: control (i.p. injection of
DMSO + gavage with TMZ suspension vehicle, once a day for 3 d; broken black line ); p53 inhibitor precursor only (0.25 mg in 50 AL DMSO administered by i.p. injection
once a day for 3 d; broken gray line ); TMZ only (10 mg/kg administered in oral suspension vehicle by gavage, once a day for 3 d for GBM 12, GBM 14, and
U87, and 50 mg/kg once a day for 3 d for GBM 26; solid black line ); or combination TMZ + p53 inhibitor (solid gray line ), as indicated for each agent’s use alone.
Treatment periods are indicated by a vertical gray column in each of the graphs in A and B. A, survival plots for each experiment show that combined TMZ + p53
inhibitor precursor treatment significantly extends symptom-free survival relative to TMZ alone in mice with p53wt tumor (GBM 26, GBM 14, and U87), but not in mice
with p53null GBM 12. P values indicated at the top of each graph are for TMZ alone versus TMZ + p53 inhibitor precursor comparisons. B, corresponding
bioluminescence imaging curves, with plots beginning at day of treatment initiation, and showing either lack of effect or suppression of luminescence resulting from TMZ
+/ p53 inhibitor precursor treatments (mean luminescence values plotted for each treatment group, with SE indicated). For the plots involving GBM 26, GBM 14, and
U87, the number of days between log-phase tumor growth for TMZ only and TMZ + p53 inhibitor precursor treatment groups is indicated, and the order of these
differences (largest to smallest) is consistent with the order for corresponding length of survival benefit (see Table 1). To the far right are luminescence intensity overlay
images. For mice with intracranial GBM 14, GBM 26, or U87, mice with lowest and highest intracranial tumor luminescence in TMZ only and TMZ + p53 inhibitor
treatment groups, respectively, are shown, with images captured at days indicated by the arrowheads along the TMZ + p53 inhibitor plots in A . For GBM 12, which does
not show additional response to combination treatment beyond that associated with TMZ alone, image overlays are shown for mice that define the median tumor
luminescence from each group at the day indicated by the arrowhead over the corresponding graph in A. C, MGMT promoter methylation analysis showing lack of
methylation in GBM 26, which has corresponding detectable protein expression (D ) and displays resistance to TMZ alone (A ). Results for tumors GBM 12, GBM 14, and
U87 show the presence of MGMT promoter methylation and corresponding lack of detectable protein by immunoblot.

GBM patients whose tumors are of wt p53 status (20). Looking
beyond the GBM-specific interests of this report, it seems plausible
that the results of our study are generalizable to other types of
cancer as well as to other types of genotoxic therapy.
An additional observation associated with this study is that TMZ
+ p53 inhibitor treatment is without adverse effect, as evidenced by
autopsy analysis of animal subjects that showed no abnormal
cellular proliferation in tissue from mice receiving TMZ + p53
inhibitor treatment (e.g., gastrointestinal tract; Supplementary
Fig. S4A). This, in combination with the long-term survival of
mice that received TMZ + p53 inhibitor (see GBM 14 results in
Fig. 3A), as well as the similarity in group body weight patterns for
TMZ only and TMZ + p53 inhibitor treated mice (Supplementary
Fig. S4B), suggests a lack of acute as well as long-term effects of
this therapy. Nonetheless, the simultaneous administration of a
DNA-damaging agent with an inhibitor of DNA repair could
promote undesirable systemic side effects, including the develop-
