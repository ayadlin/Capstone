BACKGROUND. Many studies have succeeded in identifying a subset of children
with febrile neutropenia (FN) who are at lower risk of infectious complications
and eventual death. Conversely, to the authors’ knowledge, no scoring system has
been published to date with which to assess the risk of mortality for the whole
group of children with neutropenia and fever.

METHODS. Between March 2000 and July 2004, 1520 episodes of FN in 981 children were included in a multicentric prospective study to evaluate a scoring system that was designed to identify high mortality risk at the onset of an FN
episode in children with cancer.

RESULTS. In the derivation set (714 episodes), 18 patients died (2.5%). A multivariate analysis yielded the following significant mortality-related risk factors:
advanced stage of underlying malignant disease (odds ratio [OR], 3122.1; 95%

ever, this group is heterogeneous and includes
patients who have different risks of developing severe
infections and related complications.2
The standard of care for patients with FN usually
has been limited to hospitalization; the administration of intravenous, broad-spectrum antibiotics; and
close observation.3 Several additional approaches
have been attempted during the last decade, and
many studies succeeded in identifying a subset of
patients with lower risk of developing infectious
complications and death.4 Bacteremia, other severe
bacterial infections, and mortality were the most frequently assessed variable.5–9 However, the studies
that intended to identify risk factors used different
designs and definitions, hindering the development
of a standardized risk profile. However, several
authorities analyzed the performance of different
mortality scores on adult patients with cancer, either
with or without FN, who were admitted to intensive
care units,10–12 including the Acute Physiology and
Chronic Health Evaluation, the Organ Dysfunction
and Infection Score, and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score. Results varied according to the method
employed.12 Furthermore, a recent report from a
multicenter European study of adults with FN used a
scoring system that was designed to define low-risk
patients.13 However, to the best of our knowledge, no
scoring system to assess the risk of mortality in children with FN has been published to date. Indeed, a
scoring system applied to the initial evaluation of
children with FN would be useful for identifying
patients with a high risk of mortality, because it
would allow the selection of more aggressive initial
therapy in the hope of improving their outcome.
Likewise, the identification of low-risk patients could
provide a basis for the development of less expensive
and less aggressive therapies. In fact, it is becoming
a frequent strategy to treat these kinds of patients on
sequential parenteral-oral14–16 or oral17 schedules in
an ambulatory setting.18–23
The objective of the current prospective study
was to test a scoring system to assess mortality in
children with FN. We identified the risk factors for
mortality in children with cancer and FN in our center and, subsequently, designed a scoring system to
predict mortality within the first hours of hospitalization. Thereafter, this scoring system was tested and
was validated statistically at 8 pediatric institutions
in Argentina.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Setting
The identification and assessment of risk factors for
mortality, along with the initial development of the

2573

scoring system (derivation set), were carried out at
the Professor Dr. Juan P. Garrahan Pediatric Hospital
in Buenos Aires, Argentina, a 550-bed tertiary-care
pediatric center with special assistance for oncohematology patients and solid-organ recipients. The
validation of the scoring system was performed at
the same center and in 7 additional pediatric institutions from different regions of Argentina: Pedro de
Elizalde Hospital (Buenos Aires), Professor Dr. Alejandro Posadas National Hospital (Buenos Aires), Dr.
Humberto Notti Pediatric Hospital (Mendoza), Victor
J. Vilela Hospital (Rosario), Children’s Hospital
(Rosario), Juan Pablo II Pediatric Hospital (Corrientes), and Castro Rendon Hospital (Neuquen).

Patients
All patients who were hospitalized between March
2000 and September 2002 potentially were eligible
for the study. The study was conducted according to
Declaration of Helsinki guidelines.
The inclusion criteria were: 1) children aged <18
years with neutropenia after chemotherapy for a primary malignant disease, 2) an absolute neutrophil
count of either <500/mm3 or between 500/mm3 and
1000/mm3 with a predicted decline <500/mm3, and 3)
1 episode of a fever >38.58C or 2 records >388C within
24 hours. Patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation were not included. Patients who were
included for the validation phase were those who were
hospitalized between March 2003 and July 2004.
Management Strategy
Peripheral blood cultures, urine cultures, and chest
x-rays were obtained from all patients at the onset of
the study. Blood samples from port catheters and
from peripheral veins for quantitative differential cultures also were taken from all patients. In addition,
when skin and soft tissue infections, diarrhea, phyarangitis, or any other localized infection were suspected, cultures of specimens from the involved sites
were obtained.
High-risk patients were defined by the presence
of any of the following risk factors: 1) severe comorbidities, eg, incoercible bleeding, refractory hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hypotension, altered mental
status, renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate <50% of normal levels for the patient’s
age), hepatic dysfunction (serum alanine aminotransferase levels >4 times normal or bilirubin levels
>3 mg% at the time of the preceding chemotherapy
cycle); 2) respiratory failure; 3) poor clinical condition; 4) fascial, perineal, or catheter-associated cellulitis; 5) evidence of enteritis or severe mucositis; 6)
uncontrolled local infection; 7) positive blood cul-

tures within the first 24 hours; 8) advanced stage of
underlying diseases, ie, bone marrow involvement,
recurrence, second tumor, highly myelotoxic chemotherapy, or genetic disease; and 9) parents or caregivers deemed absolutely reliable by the medical staff.
After samples were collected, empiric antibiotic
treatment was started. Therapy was based on our
previous experience,15,16,22 as follows: ceftriaxone
(100 mg/kg per day intravenously [iv] as a single
dose; maximum dose, 2 g plus amikacin (15 mg/kg
per day iv as a single dose) the first day, followed by
ciprofloxacin (20 mg/kg per day orally every 12
hours) for low-risk children and ceftazidime (100
mg/kg per day iv every 8 hours) or imipenem (50
mg/kg per day iv every 6 hours) plus amikacin for
high-risk patients. Patients who had been receiving
prophylactic acyclovir continued to receive this
agent. The use of hematopoietic growth factors did
not hinder the enrollment of patients, and their
administration was at the discretion of the attending
oncologist for each patient.
Low-risk patients were discharged after 24 hours
of hospitalization and were subjected to follow-up
every 24 hours as outpatients by clinical examination
and a differential leukocyte counts every 48 hours
when persistent neutropenia was observed. High-risk
patients remained hospitalized and were discharged
only when their clinical state was satisfactory, they
remained afebrile for 72 hours, and had an absolute
neutrophil count >100/mm3.

Definitions
Sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction were
defined as described previously.23 Renal impairment
was defined as a glomerular filtration rate <50% of the
normal rate for the patient’s age, and hepatic impairment was defined by a serum alanine aminotransferase levels that was 4 times normal or by a bilirubin
level that was >3 mg% at the time of the preceding
chemotherapy cycle. Metabolic values were based on
previous recommendations.24 Advanced stage of
underlying disease implied bone marrow involvement,
recurrence, second tumor, high-dose myelotoxic
chemotherapy, or genetic disease.
Treatment success was defined as the resolution
of the episode of fever and neutropenia without any
readmission because of a new fever episode within 7
days of discharge or a new febrile episode during the
same period of neutropenia. Death was the main
variable in the assessment of final outcome.
Data Collection
The following variables were collected and registered
for analysis: age, sex, underlying disease and staging,

predicted period of neutropenia, presence of intravenous device (Hickman or Broviac catheters), previous
administration of antibiotics or granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF), and presence of a clinical
site of infection. Facial, oral, anal, and catheter cellulitis as well as enteritis, sepsis, necrotizing gingivitis,
and mucositis were considered high-risk clinical foci.
Pneumonia was analyzed separately. Also analyzed
separately were the results from microbiologic isolations and the presence of associated comorbidities
(ie, incoercible bleeding, refractory hypoglycemia
and hypocalcemia, hypotension, altered mental status, renal insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction, and respiratory failure).

Statistics
Data analysis was performed using the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 11.0. Descriptive data are expressed as percentages, medians,
and ranges or as means and standard deviations.
Associations between potential risk factors and mortality were analyzed through bivariate and multivariate methods. Statistical significance was calculated
using chi-square or Fisher exact tests for nominal
variables and Student t tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum
tests for numerical variables. All independent variables that yielded P  .10 in the bivariate analysis
were included as covariables in the multivariate analysis (logistic regression, forward stepwise method;
Pin ¼ .05; Pout ¼ .10). Risk is reported informed as
the relative risk (RR) for bivariate analyses and the
odds ratio (OR) for logistic regression analyses. Statistical significance is reported as P and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Model and score
performance is expressed as sensitivity, specificity,
predictive values, and overall accuracy. All P values
.05 were regarded as significant.

RESULTS
Derivation Set
In all, 714 episodes of FN in 458 patients who were
admitted to the Professor Dr. Juan P. Garrahan Pediatric Hospital were registered prospectively for the
derivation set. Fifty-three percent of patients were
boys. The median age was 83.7 months (range, 1–215
months). Acute leukemia was the most frequent
underlying disease. Twenty-five percent of patients
had been treated with high-dose chemotherapy
followed by long periods of neutropenia. The mean
time to fever onset after the last chemotherapy
course was 11.8  42.3 days. Only 14% of children
received G-CSF. Sixty percent of children had neutrophil counts <100/mm3 at registration (Table 1).

Sixty-four percent of patients displayed an overt clinical site of infection at onset. Upper respiratory tract
infections predominated. Thirteen percent of children showed some degree of mucositis. Bacteremia
was detected in 97 patients (14%). Staphylococcus

95% CI, 2.3–21.9) remained independent risk factors
for mortality. This model had a specificity of 93.53%
and a sensitivity of 77.78%.
The scoring system to predict mortality was
developed by assigning differential points to independent risk factors that were identified in the multivariate analysis as follows: the presence of an
advanced stage of underlying malignant disease (ie,
bone marrow involvement) was assigned 3 points,
the presence of associated comorbidity was assigned
2 points, and bacteremia was assigned 1 point. The
likelihood of death for patients who had totals 4, 5,
and 6 points in the scoring system was 5.8%, 15.4%,
and 40%, respectively. None of the patients who had
a total of 3 points died (Table 5).
Using a cut-off score of 4 points to discriminate
between high-risk and low-risk patients, the scoring
system had a sensitivity of 85.94%, a specificity of
100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a neg-

therapy, a greater proportion of central venous catheters, more patients had lower respiratory tract infections, there was more mucositis, and there was a
lower incidence of upper respiratory tract infections
compared with the derivation set (P < .05).
The validation statistical analysis confirmed that
the differences in score categories between children
who died because of an infection and those who survived was statistically significant (P < .0001). The RR
of mortality for children who accumulated scores >4
points was 23.71 (95% CI, 7–80.33) (Table 6). The
sensitivity of the score was 84.21%, the specificity
was 83.23%, the positive predictive power was
89.19%, and the negative predictive power was
99.54%. Less than 0.5% of registered children who
had scores <4 points were at risk of death.

DISCUSSION
Patients who receive therapy for malignant disease
and FN constitute a wide-spectrum group. The risk
of severe infection and eventual death varies according to different patient characteristics.2 Risk analysis
offers a more rational approach for these patients.
The onset and duration of neutropenia may be
predicted for each patient, and the risk of a febrile
episode at its onset may be evaluated accurately
within the context of the patient.2 Many high-risk
variables have been analyzed and reported, such as
bacteremia,5 severe bacterial infections,6 and mortality.2,7 The reported mortality rate for patients with
FN is <5%.4,5,7 This low incidence is similar to the
results from our current study and makes it necessary to gather a large numbers of patients to obtain
valid conclusions. Other studies have analyzed variables related to FN in low-risk patients to test ambulatory and oral therapies.8,9,13–17
Several factors predict the onset of severe bacterial infections, bacteremia, or infection-related mor-

tality, such as underlying disease characteristics
(bone marrow involvement, recurrence, second tumor, highly myelotoxic chemotherapy, genetic diseases, delayed bone marrow recovery), severe
neutropenia, predicted neutropenia for >7 days,
absolute monocyte count <100/mm3, fever >398C,
thrombocytopenia <50.000/mm3, fever onset <7
days after the last chemotherapy course, signs of
sepsis, arterial hypotension, and associated comorbid
factors.3–10,22,25,26 A score to predict mortality is a
useful tool to evaluate and manage patients with
severe infections. A major advantage is the objectivity of criteria to evaluate patients. Some risk profiles
have been tested, but very few have proposed a welldesigned and statistically supported score to predict
mortality at onset in children who are treated for
malignant diseases. Published studies with analyses
that establish a risk score for mortality are scarce
and mainly are based on adult and pediatric patients
without neutropenia in the setting of intensive care
unit admissions, adults hospitalized in oncology
units, and low mortality risk scores in an adult population.11,13 To our knowledge, there are no publications to date concerning the analysis of mortalitybased scores in hospitalized pediatric patients with
FN.
The better evaluation of low-risk children with
FN has allowed the development of new therapeutic
strategies, like the sequential parenteral-oral
approach,16 oral-only treatments,17 and ambulatory
treatments.18–21,25,27,28 Our current results support
the use of these new strategies for the low-risk group.
Conversely, the use of a mortality score for high-risk
patients allows a better initial approach for such
children (ie, precocious admission for upper respiratory tract infections, antibiotic therapy, and aggressive clinical support for selected patients). Thus, it is
possible to predict mortality in these patients.
Klastersky et al. carried out a multicentric study
in several European countries and analyzed the use
of a score to identify low-risk adult cancer patients
with FN.13 That score yielded a sensitivity of 71%
and a specificity of 68%. We cannot compare those
results with the results from pediatric patients,
because the diseases and therapies vary widely
between the groups, and the complications also differ. Adults usually present a higher rate of associated
comorbidity than children. In the current study, we
also demonstrated that the presence of associated
comorbidity is a high risk factor for mortality.
Another study reported by Santolaya et al.25 relied on
a risk profile tested in Chile to predict severe bacterial infections in children. That risk profile had a
higher sensitivity (90%) than ours (78%) but had

lower specificity (65%) compared with what we
obtained in our study (93%). Santolaya et al. also
established that disease recurrence and arterial hypotension were predictive factors for severe bacterial
infection. Likewise, we were able to demonstrate that
the presence of an advanced stage of underlying malignant disease (including disease recurrence) was
related significantly to a higher risk of mortality together with the presence of associated comorbidity.
Bacteremia has been defined by some authors as
a risk factor for cancer patients with FN.5,29 A previous study at our institution of 863 FN episodes in pediatric cancer patients corroborated those results.7 In
our analysis that defined risk factors for our scoring
system, bacteremia was associated significantly with
mortality. In 2 earlier former studies in which risk
factors in severe bacterial infections were analyzed in
children with thrombocytopenia, fever onset <7 days
after the last chemotherapy course, C-reactive protein levels >90 mg/dL, the need of resuscitation,
severe neutropenia (<200 neutrophils/mm3), and
fever >398C, were associated significantly with a high
mortality rate.6,25 With the exception of C-reactive
protein levels, the same variables were analyzed in
our study and did not yield any statistical significance.
Our scoring system was capable of indicating
that a child with FN had a high risk of death if 1 or
more of the following factors were present at onset:
advanced stage of malignant disease (bone marrow
involvement, recurrence, second tumor, highly myelotoxic therapy, genetic disease, bone marrow involvement), severe associated comorbidity, and
bacteremia. The assessment for bacteremia requires
24 hours after sampling to have blood culture
results. The concomitant use of scores to define the
risk of bacteremia in these children may enhance the
value of the current mortality score further without
requiring blood culture results to complete the
assessment of all mortality risk factors at onset.
The variables that are assessed with this score
are simple, easy to determine, and easy to apply to
patients with NF. The outstanding validation results
of the multicentric study have provided solid statistical support for the judicious clinical application of
this scoring system.
