ABSTRACT
Histone deacetylases are important targets for cancer therapeutics, but their
regulation is poorly understood. Our data show coordinated transcription of HDAC1 and
HDAC2 in lung cancer cell lines, but suggest HDAC2 protein expression is cell-context
specific. Through an unbiased siRNA screen we found that BRCA1-associated protein
1 (BAP1) regulates their expression, with HDAC2 reduced and HDAC1 increased in
BAP1 depleted cells. BAP1 loss-of-function is increasingly reported in cancers including
thoracic malignancies, with frequent mutation in malignant pleural mesothelioma.
Endogenous HDAC2 directly correlates with BAP1 across a panel of lung cancer cell lines,
and is downregulated in mesothelioma cell lines with genetic BAP1 inactivation. We find
that BAP1 regulates HDAC2 by increasing transcript abundance, rather than opposing
its ubiquitylation. Importantly, although total cellular HDAC activity is unaffected by
transient depletion of HDAC2 or of BAP1 due to HDAC1 compensation, this isoenzyme
imbalance sensitizes MSTO-211H cells to HDAC inhibitors. However, other established
mesothelioma cell lines with low endogenous HDAC2 have adapted to become more
resistant to HDAC inhibition. Our work establishes a mechanism by which BAP1 loss
alters sensitivity of cancer cells to HDAC inhibitors. Assessment of BAP1 and HDAC
expression may ultimately help identify patients likely to respond to HDAC inhibitors.

IV (HDAC11); plus seven NAD+-dependent sirtuins that
form a functionally distinct class III (SIRT1-SIRT7) [2].
This multiplicity of HDACs reflects their diverse and tissuespecific functions.
Class I HDACs are widely expressed and, within
this class, HDAC1 and HDAC2 are most closely related.
They have a near identical gene structure indicative of
duplication from a common ancestor, and retain 86% amino
acid sequence identity. HDAC1 and HDAC2 can homo- and
hetero-dimerize, but are commonly found together in multiprotein complexes on which their catalytic activity depends.
HDAC1 and HDAC2 are predominantly nuclear, usually
associated with chromatin and play key transcriptional roles,
although they have also been implicated in splicing, mitosis,
meiosis, DNA replication and DNA repair (reviewed in [3]).

INTRODUCTION
The histone deacetylases (HDACs) are an ancient and
highly conserved family of enzymes that catalyze removal of
acetyl groups from lysine residues, antagonizing the effects
of histone acetyl-transferases (HATs). The HDACs play key
roles in epigenetic modulation of gene expression through
their activity towards histones. However, a considerable
proportion of the proteome is subject to reversible acetylation
[1] and, as HDACs have activity towards a plethora of
protein substrates, they are more accurately termed lysine
deacetylases. They comprise two sub-families: eleven zincdependent isoenzymes that are divided into class I (HDAC1,
HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC8), class IIa (HDAC4, HDAC5,
HDAC7, HDAC9), class IIb (HDAC6, HDAC10) and class

We set out to investigate the co-expression of HDAC1
and HDAC2 in lung cancer cell lines and to use an unbiased
siRNA screen to identify DUBs that may regulate HDAC1
and/or HDAC2 expression. We found that depletion of the
tumor suppressor BAP1 reduced HDAC2 expression, acting
at the level of transcription rather than ubiquitylation. This
provides a clear mechanism by which BAP1 loss-of-function
alters cancer cell sensitivity to specific HDAC inhibitors.

Controversy has raged over the redundancy or
isoenzyme specificity of HDAC1 and HDAC2, with
loss-of-function studies in mice delivering important yet
sometimes conflicting data (reviewed in [3]). In germline
knockouts, HDAC1 is embryonic lethal before E10.5,
but HDAC2 null mice can survive until and beyond
the perinatal period, perhaps suggesting independent
functions. However, conditional isoenzyme knockouts
have less severe phenotypes, and a compensatory
mechanism is commonly seen, where deletion of HDAC1
results in increased expression of HDAC2 protein, and
vice versa. Combined conditional ablation of HDAC1 and
HDAC2 has dramatic effects on proliferation, survival,
and/or differentiation in most tissues and cell types.
Ultimately, it has required models with deletion of 3 out of
the 4 HDAC1 and HDAC2 alleles to allow elucidation of
the overlapping but specific roles for HDAC1 and HDAC2
during development.
Importantly, HDAC1 and HDAC2 are dysregulated
in many human diseases including diabetes, asthma,
neurological disorders and cancer. In breast or
osteoscarcoma cells HDAC1, but not HDAC2, was
required for proliferation and its depletion led to cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis [4]. Intriguingly though, HDAC2 is
specifically degraded in airway disease through stressresponsive post-translational modifications (PTMs)
triggered by cigarette smoke [5]. Both HDAC1 and
HDAC2 are known to be phosphorylated, acetylated,
ubiquitylated, SUMOylated, nitrosylated and alkylated
(reviewed in [6]). Isoenzyme specific PTMs, particularly
within the less well conserved C-terminal, may contribute
to the context-specific redundancy or independent
activities of HDAC1 and HDAC2 [6]. In the setting of
reversible ubiquitylation, alternative ubiquitin E3 ligases
have been identified for HDAC1 [7, 8] and HDAC2
[9, 10], which either modulate their transcriptional
activity or target them for proteasomal degradation, but
no deubiquitylases (DUBs) have yet been identified that
antagonize these functions.
Given their deregulation in cancer HDAC1 and
HDAC2 are important therapeutic targets. First generation
pan-HDAC inhibitors, such as vorinostat (SAHA), bind the
active site Zn2+ ion critical for the function of class I, II and
IV HDACS. Their anti-tumor activity is largely attributed
to selective induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in
cancer cells [2]. Vorinostat was the first HDAC inhibitor to be
licensed, for use in treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
[11]. However vorinostat has shown limited efficacy in single
agent trials for solid tumors [12]. Accumulating evidence
that specific HDAC isoenzymes deacetylate distinct target
proteins, and are differentially expressed in cancers, argues
for the use of more specific HDAC inhibitors. Class I or class
II selective inhibitors are available, and isotype-selective
inhibitors are in development [13]. Identifying cellular targets
that sensitize to HDAC inhibition may enable stratification of
patients within trials.

RESULTS
We initially investigated the interdependence
of HDAC1 and HDAC2 expression, and evaluated
the relative contribution of transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulation towards their protein level
expression. To this end, we simultaneously extracted total
RNA and cellular protein from a panel of lung cancer
cell lines for quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting
(Figure 1A and 1B). The panel comprised cell lines
derived from normal bronchial epithelium or fibroblasts,
together with three small cell lung cancer (SCLC), one
carcinoid and six non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
cell lines. We saw very tight correlation between the
transcript levels of HDAC1 and HDAC2 across the eight
non-neuroendocrine cell lines, with increased expression
in NSCLC relative to normal lung (Figure 1A and 1C),
suggesting that transcription of HDAC1 and HDAC2
may be co-regulated. However, expression of HDAC1
and HDAC2 were uncoupled in neuroendocrine cell lines,
so that in each case one of the isoenzyme transcripts
was markedly elevated relative to the other: HDAC2 in
SCLC (NCI-H69, NCI-H345 and Lu-165) and HDAC1
in the NCI-H727 carcinoid cell line (Figure 1A). In
non-neuroendocrine cells, HDAC1 mRNA was a good
predictor for the HDAC1 protein expression level, but this
was not true for HDAC2 (Figure 1D). Thus, in a given
cellular context, the level of HDAC2 may be largely
dependent on post-transcriptional, translational or posttranslational regulatory mechanisms. As compensatory
responses in protein expression are reported between the
HDAC1 and HDAC2 isoenzymes in conditional knockout
mice [3], and on siRNA depletion in osteosarcoma and
breast cancer cell lines [4], we tested if this was also the
case in A549 lung cancer cells. As predicted, we saw
increased HDAC2 protein in HDAC1 depleted cells,
and increased HDAC1 protein in HDAC2 depleted cells
(Figure 1E).
HDAC1 and HDAC2 are both subject to ubiquitinmediated proteasomal degradation and several E3 ligases
have been assigned [7–10]. However, ubiquitylation is a
reversible process, and no DUBs have yet been described
that may remove ubiquitin from HDAC1 or HDAC2.
To identify DUBs that might be involved in specifically
regulating the cellular abundance of either HDAC, we
utilized a library of quality-controlled nucleoplasm lysates
prepared from A549 NSCLC cells that had been depleted

of each of the 92 human DUBs using a custom siRNA
library, as described previously [14, 15]. We screened
by immunoblotting and ranked the ratio of expression
for HDAC2 relative to HDAC1 (Figure 2A). This ratio
will reflect both the decrease in one HDAC (for example
where a DUB is depleted that might normally rescue it
from proteasomal degradation) and the compensatory
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

increase for the opposite HDAC isoenzyme (as shown in
Figure 1E). Whilst USP33 or USPL1 depletion increased
the HDAC2/HDAC1 ratio, we identified USP27X and the
tumor suppressor BAP1 as DUBs whose depletion lead to
the most significant decrease in the HDAC2/HDAC1 ratio.
In the case of BAP1, this indeed reflected both a decrease in
HDAC2 and an increase in HDAC1 expression (Figure 2A).

This initial screen used pools of four siRNA
sequences to target each DUB. To assess whether
off-target effects might be responsible for altering
HDAC abundance, we next transfected A549 cells with
independent siRNA sequences. Statistically, it is unlikely
that more than one siRNA would have the same off-target
effect, so our criteria were that at least two individual
siRNAs targeting a DUB produced a similar change
in the HDAC2/HDAC1 ratio. This was not the case for
USP33 or USPL1, and was marginal for USP27X (data
not shown). In contrast, a reduction in HDAC2/HDAC1
was recapitulated by two siRNA sequences targeting
BAP1 in A549 nucleoplasm extracts (Figure 2B). Both
HDACs were also detected in cytosolic extracts, where
their expression ratio was similarly affected by BAP1
siRNAs (Figure 2B), confirming that BAP1 depletion
effects a change in abundance rather than sub-cellular
relocalisation. BAP1 knockdown elicited this same switch
in HDAC2/HDAC1 expression in two other NSCLC
cell lines (Figure 2C), which endogenously express
these HDACs at different levels (Figure 1B). As loss

of BAP1 function is implicated in a high proportion of
mesothelioma [16–19], we next asked whether we could
recapitulate this effect in MSTO-211H cells, which were
derived from a grade 4 biphasic mesothelioma and retain
wild-type BAP1 expression [19]. Depletion of BAP1
consistently reduced HDAC2 and increased HDAC1
expression in whole cell protein extracts from these cells
(Figure 2D & 2E). As before, siBAP1–3 more profoundly
affected the HDAC2/HDAC1 expression ratio than
siBAP1–5. Effects of BAP1 depletion were more marked
in the MSTO-211H cells than in A549 cells, due to the
relative knockdown efficiencies (Figure 2F).
In light of the effect of transient BAP1 depletion on
HDAC expression, we hypothesized that variation in the
endogenous expression of BAP1 in cancer cells may also
influence HDAC levels. BAP1 is expressed to varying
degrees across the panel of SCLC, NSCLC and normal
lung cell lines, and is relatively under-expressed in the
A549 cell line (Figure 3A) in which we had performed our
initial screen (Figure 2A). In contrast, BAP1 is elevated
in the SCLC cell lines, which express HDAC2 at high

levels. Overall, we found a significant positive correlation
between BAP1 and HDAC2 levels, as illustrated for the
seven NSCLC and two normal lung cell lines in Figure
3B. In contrast there was no correlation between HDAC1
and BAP1 expression (linear regression R2 = 0.11).
As BAP1 depletion had a profound effect on the
HDAC2/HDAC1 expression ratio in MSTO-211H cells
(Figure 2D & E), we next examined the relationship
between endogenous HDAC2 and BAP1 mutation status in
a panel of established mesothelioma cell lines (Figure 3C).
The MeT-5A cell line is derived from normal lung
mesothelium, whilst the mesothelioma cell lines have
differing BAP1 genetic status [19]: NCI-H2052 and MSTO211H cells retain genetically wild-type BAP1, NCI-H28
and NCI-H226 cells are BAP1 null, and NCI-H2452
cells have an inactivating mutation in the BAP1 catalytic
domain. Immunoblotting confirmed that BAP1 protein
was expressed in the three wild-type lines, and was absent
in the BAP1 null mesothelioma cell lines (Figure 3C).
Very low levels of BAP1 were detected in NCI-H2452
cells, suggesting that BAP1 auto-deubiquitylation is not
only required for nuclear localization [20] but perhaps
also stability in these cells. Both HDAC1 and HDAC2
were expressed in the normal mesothelial MeT-5A
cells, and HDAC1 was expressed at varying levels in
the mesothelioma cell lines (Figure 3C). As predicted,
HDAC2 expression was low in BAP1 null mesothelioma
cell lines and overall showed a tight correlation with BAP1
expression status (Figure 3C & D). A notable exception
was the NCI-H2052 cell line, which has loss of HDAC2
copy number (COSMIC, [21]) that likely accounts for low
expression of HDAC2 even in the presence of BAP1.
This correlative expression further supported our
functional data showing that BAP1 regulates HDAC2,
so we investigated whether BAP1 might directly
deubiquitylate and thus stabilize HDAC2. We first assessed
whether inhibition of the proteasome led to accumulation of
HDACs (Figure 4A). In BAP1 wild-type MSTO-211H cells
we saw a marginal increase in HDAC2 levels in response
to epoxomicin. Although we might expect a more profound
response in BAP1-null cells, in fact we saw no increase in
HDAC protein levels on epoxomicin treatment of NCI-H28,
suggesting that turnover of HDAC2 is not a major limitation
for its expression in this cell line. To determine whether
HDAC2 turnover is BAP1-dependent in MSTO-211H cells,
we compared rescue by proteasome inhibition in siRNAtransfected cells (Figure 4B). Expression of the labile
protein P53 was clearly rescued by proteasome inhibition,
and this was comparable between the knockdown
conditions. As before, HDAC2 rescue by proteasome
inhibition was modest, and was similar in BAP1-depleted or
control cells. In addition, we found that BAP1 depletion did
not reduce the stability of residual HDAC2 under conditions
where translation was blocked (Figure 4C). Together these
data suggest that BAP1 does not salvage HDAC2 from
ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation.

BAP1 is known to regulate H2A monoubiquitylation,
as well as the polyubiquitylation of a number of
transcription factors, so we wondered whether BAP1
might instead control transcription of HDAC2. To test this,
we performed qRT-PCR in siRNA-transfected MSTO211H cells and observed a marked decrease in HDAC2
transcript levels in cells depleted of BAP1 (Figure 4D).
Indeed, we observed a strong correlation between HDAC2
protein (Figure 2E) and HDAC2 mRNA expression in
these experiments (Figure 4E). In contrast, HDAC1 levels
were not significantly affected by BAP1 depletion, and did
not correlate with HDAC1 protein levels. We conclude
that BAP1 primarily exerts its effects through regulating
HDAC2 transcript abundance, which is coupled with
compensation in HDAC2/HDAC1 protein expression.
To establish whether the BAP1-dependent changes in
HDAC1 and HDAC2 expression impact on overall cellular
HDAC activity, we assayed the enzymatic activity of cell
extracts towards an artificial HDAC-GloI/II substrate.
In A549 cells, chronic treatment with the pan-HDAC
inhibitor TSA abolished 75% of cellular HDAC activity
as determined by this assay (Figure 5A). However, siRNA
depletion of HDAC1, HDAC2 or BAP1 did not lead to
significantly different cellular HDAC activity, suggesting
that in each case the compensatory isoenzyme response
maintains overall activity levels (Figure 5B and 5C). In
MSTO-211H cells, acute treatment with vorinostat again
reduced HDAC activity (Figure 5D), but we confirmed that
depletion of either HDAC, or of BAP1, had no significant
impact (Figure 5E and 5F).
Although total HDAC activity was unchanged, we
were interested to determine whether the BAP1-dependent
switch in the HDAC2/HDAC1 isoenzymes affected cell
viability when combined with HDAC inhibitors. We
initially established the lethal concentration 30% for
drugs that exhibit pan- or class-selective HDAC inhibition
in MSTO-211H cells (Figure 6A). We next assessed the
effects of BAP1 or HDAC siRNA on cell viability. While
HDAC1 depletion had little effect, depletion of HDAC2
significantly reduced cell viability, suggesting that MSTO211H cells are dependent on HDAC2 for survival (Figure
6B, DMSO). Importantly, BAP1 depletion also reduced
viability. This effect was more pronounced for siBAP1–3
than for siBAP1–5, mirroring their respective effects on
HDAC2 expression (Figure 2).
We then explored whether MSTO-211H cells
depleted of these proteins would be more sensitive to
HDAC inhibitors applied at their LC30 (Figure 6C).
None of the siRNA transfected cells were significantly
sensitized to the class IIa selective inhibitor MC1568.
Neither did addition of pan-HDAC (vorinostat) or of
class I selective (mocetinostat) inhibitors significantly
influence the survival of HDAC1 depleted cells. In
contrast, HDAC2 depleted cells were sensitized to both
HDAC inhibitors, with significantly decreased viability
compared to DMSO alone. Importantly, BAP1 knockdown

also increased sensitivity to HDAC inhibition in a similar
fashion, decreasing cell survival with both vorinostat and
mocetinostat.
In dose response curves, the LC50 of vorinostat
halves from 2.6 μM in siC-treated cells to 1.3 μM with
HDAC2 siRNA and 1.2 μM in BAP1 depleted cells.
Crucially, concomitant BAP1 and HDAC2 depletion did not
additively reduce cell viability in the presence of vorinostat
(Figure 6D). This is consistent with loss of BAP1 mediating
increased drug sensitivity through its ability to lower
HDAC2 levels. Lastly, we assessed the relative HDAC
inhibitor sensitivity of three established mesothelioma cells
with constitutively low HDAC2 expression together with
the MSTO-211H cells that retain high HDAC2 expression
(Figure 3C). Intriguingly, in contrast to our data for transient
HDAC2 knockdown, the constitutively HDAC2-deficient
mesothelioma cell lines were more resistant to mocetinostat
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 6E). We found that the LC50 of the HDAC2deficient lines NCI-H2052, NCI-H28 and NCI-H226 was
4.0, 4.5 and 4.9 μM, respectively, compared to 2.4 μM for
MSTO-211H cells. Furthermore, in the HDAC2-deficient
lines, around a third of cells remained viable at much
higher doses, suggesting they have adapted to become less
dependent on HDAC2 for viability.
In conclusion, loss of BAP1 in cell line models of
thoracic malignancies alters expression of HDAC2. This
in turn modulates the sensitivity of these cells to clinically
relevant HDAC inhibitors.

somatic BAP1 mutation occurs in only around 1% of
lung adenocarcinoma [23, 24], but is far more prevalent
in uveal melanoma [25, 26], mesothelioma [18, 19] and
renal clear cell carcinoma [27]. Germline BAP1 mutation
underpins a cancer predisposition syndrome [18, 25,
26, 28–30] and BAP1 protein expression is reportedly
lost in around 50% of NSCLC, colon carcinoma, uveal
melanoma and kidney cancers [31–37]. Mechanistically,
BAP1 removes monoubiquitin from histone H2A
[38], or stabilizes proteins like BRCA1 and HCFC1 by
removing polyubiquitin chains [22, 39, 40], whilst many
transcription factors and chromatin modifiers have been
identified as BAP1 interacting proteins [41, 42].
Here we show for the first time that BAP1
modulates expression of another chromatin-associated
protein, HDAC2. However, this is mediated not through
direct deubiquitylation of HDAC2, but through regulating
HDAC2 transcript abundance. Loss of BAP1 increases
H2A monoubiquitylation, which is transcriptionally
repressive, suggesting one route by which this may
be mediated. However, indirect effects of BAP1 via
transcription factors that control HDAC2 transcription,
or through alteration of HDAC2 transcript stability,
might also play roles. We find that BAP1 loss promotes
a switch from HDAC2 to HDAC1. This arises due to a
well-established reciprocal compensatory mechanism,
so that when HDAC2 levels drop, HDAC1 levels
rise. In cell lines and in transgenic mice, this crosstalk
between HDAC1 and HDAC2 is not mediated by altered
transcription, but through changes in either protein
synthesis or turnover [43, 44].
It is interesting that our current screening strategy
did not uncover any DUBs that reverse HDAC2
polyubiquitylation and so stabilize the HDAC2 protein.
In fact, our data also suggest that HDAC2 turnover by
proteasomal degradation may not be a major determinant
of its abundance under normal growth conditions in
these cell lines. Strategies to stimulate HDAC2 turnover,
such as the response to cigarette smoke [5], may aid
future screens for DUBs that directly antagonize
ubiquitylation of HDAC2.
When we compared HDAC expression in a panel
of cell lines, we found that HDAC2 transcript abundance
was not a good predictor of HDAC2 protein level
(Figure 1D). This is not unusual, in fact global studies
report that the major determinant of protein abundance
is neither transcription nor protein degradation, but is
instead translation [45]. Intriguingly though, when we
deplete BAP1 leading to a reduction in HDAC2 mRNA,
this transcript now becomes a good predictor of HDAC2
protein expression (Figure 4E). Taken together, these data
suggest that although HDAC1 and HDAC2 are normally
co-transcribed, the HDAC2 transcript is in excess of the
cellular requirements for HDAC2 protein. However, in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the absence of BAP1 their transcription is disengaged and
availability of HDAC2 mRNA may now limit HDAC2
protein expression.
The clinical relevance of BAP1 loss-of-function
in mesothelioma remains under debate, with conflicting
reports that it may be preferentially associated with
epithelioid morphology, later age of presentation, or
overall survival [16, 19, 36, 46] and there are as yet no
studies that provide a rationale for specific targeted
therapies. Up to 80% of mesothelioma are directly
attributable to asbestos exposure [47] and it was recently
shown that mice with heterozygous germline BAP1
knockout were predisposed to develop mesothelioma
upon asbestos exposure [48]. Interestingly, somatic BAP1
mutation is reported to be more common in current or
ex-smokers who develop mesothelioma [46] and could
conceivably compound HDAC2 instability in response to
cigarette smoke [5].
BAP1 loss might also be associated with cancer
progression and metastasis. Clinically BAP1 mutation
was initially linked to more aggressive, metastasizing
uveal melanoma [26], whilst subsequent cell models
suggested that BAP1 loss induces a stem cell-like
phenotype [49]. In mesothelioma, BAP1 loss is
more common in a clinical sub-group that exhibit
less evidence of EMT [50], but on asbestos exposure
BAP1+/– mice develop more aggressive tumors, that
invade other organs, than their wild-type littermates
[48]. In the absence of a carcinogenic insult however,
BAP1 loss may not promote cell growth. Indeed uveal
melanoma cells stably expressing BAP1 shRNA show no
difference in their in vitro or in vivo growth kinetics [49]
and BAP1+/– mice do not spontaneously develop tumors
[48]. In several studies, BAP1 loss is in fact reported to
slow cell growth through a delayed but more permissive
G1/S cell cycle checkpoint [19, 40]. Indeed, on transient
BAP1 depletion in MSTO-211H cells, we observed
an approximate 50% reduction in viable cell number,
comparable with previous data for this cell line [19].
These data suggest cytotoxic drugs targeting
rapidly dividing cells are not apposite for BAP-deficient
mesothelioma. Indeed, mesothelioma shows low chemoand radio-sensitivity and targeted therapies are urgently
required [51]. Synthetic lethal approaches offer new
opportunities to exploit essential survival pathways in
cancer cells with BAP1 loss-of-function. Several cancer
drugs have been identified that exhibit synthetic lethality
with specific tumor suppressors, most notably BRCA1
mutation/PARP inhibitors [52]. As BAP1 interacts with
BRCA1, PARP inhibitors might also exhibit synthetic
lethality with BAP1 mutation. However, whilst this was
seen in BAP1 knockout chicken lymphoma cells [53], no
synthetic effects were found in human mesothelioma cells
[19] emphasizing the importance of cellular context. Our
initial data suggest a potential relationship between BAP1
and HDAC inhibitors that could be exploited instead.

BAP1; however inferring clinical biomarkers from
transient depletion of BAP1 might give deceptive results.
Indeed, our data suggest that cells adapt to genetic BAP1
loss, such that sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors is reduced.
While our findings will need to be confirmed in other
models, this is potentially of clinical significance, as HDAC
inhibitors are currently being investigated in clinical
trials for uveal melanoma in which BAP1 mutations are
common. On the other hand, our data suggest that cancer
cells develop compensatory mechanisms to survive without
BAP1; identifying these mechanisms may provide new
opportunities for synthetic lethal strategies. Well-defined
models of genetic BAP1 loss are now needed to allow
screening for biomarkers and new targets. These, alongside
clinical studies to assess the prevalence of BAP1-dependent
HDAC2 loss, will help establish how BAP1 status affects
pan or class-selective HDAC inhibitor sensitivity.

Despite early promise, histone deacetylase inhibitors
have failed to show significant clinical activity in solid
tumors. In mesothelioma for example, while an early
phase trial found some evidence for activity of vorinostat,
a subsequent large phase III study did not show any
benefit for vorinostat in second line treatment [54, 55].
The failure of this trial understandably led to a dampening
of enthusiasm for HDAC inhibitors in mesothelioma. It is
however feasible that the lack of benefit in the overall trial
could mask a subgroup of patients who derived benefit
from treatment. The need to stratify NSCLC patients
based on EGFR mutation for EGFR inhibitor clinical trials
[56–58] highlights the importance of identifying
biomarkers that can predict for response.
We found that despite the effect on HDAC2
expression, loss of BAP1 does not impact on total cellular
HDAC activity, suggesting the compensatory increase
in HDAC1 maintains cellular HDAC activity. This is
consistent with other reports of the HDAC relationship,
for example in mice with targeted inactivation of either
HDAC1 or HDAC2 in the epidermis, there is reciprocal
upregulation of the opposite isoenzyme with no reduction
in total HDAC activity [43]. Specific roles for the class I
HDAC isoenzymes are however increasingly recognized,
and this BAP1-dependent switch in the prevalence of
HDAC1 and HDAC2 may have functional implications.
Indeed we find that HDAC2 appears more important than
HDAC1 in maintaining viability of the BAP1 positive
mesothelioma cell line MSTO-211H. Of particular
importance in a clinical setting, this could impact on the
sensitivity of cancer cells to HDAC inhibitors. Despite
the maintenance of total HDAC activity, we found
increased sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors on depletion of
HDAC2 or BAP1, but not of HDAC1 (Figure 6). This
lends support to HDAC isoenzyme-specific roles, and
suggests HDAC2 specific inhibitors might enable more
precise targeted therapy.
The relationship between BAP1 expression and
HDAC inhibitor sensitivity has not previously been
explored in mesothelioma. In uveal melanoma cell lines,
HDAC inhibitors partially rescue the loss of melanocytic
differentiation associated with BAP1 depletion [49,  59].
Furthermore, stable BAP1 depletion in a uveal melanoma
cell line leads to sensitization to the HDAC inhibitor
valproic acid and decreased viability. Although changes
in H2A ubiquitylation status were observed in this
experiment [59], the mechanism for HDAC inhibitor
sensitization remains unclear. Our data, which show
HDAC2 expression to be contingent on BAP1, provide
the first mechanism to underpin differential sensitivity of
BAP1-deficient cells to HDAC inhibitors.
Significantly however, our data show that transient
loss of BAP1 expression is not equivalent to its genetic
inactivation in cell lines that have been in long term culture,
raising a number of points. Firstly, siRNA screening has
allowed us to identify a new target of the deubiquitylase

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
A549 cells (obtained from ECACC) were cultured
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
1% non-essential amino acids, at 37°C and 5% CO2.
The mesothelioma cell lines MSTO-211H, NCI-H2052,
NCI-H28, NCI-H226 and NCI-H2452 (from ATCC) and
all other lung cancer cell lines (sourced as previously
described [60]) were cultured in RPMI supplemented
with 10% FBS. The transformed normal mesothelial
cell line MeT-5A (ATCC) was cultured in Medium
199 with added 10% FBS, 2% HEPES, 0.1% Trace
Elements B, 0.02% (100 μg/ml) EGF, 0.028% (1 mg/ml)
Hydrocortisone, 0.05% (10 mg/ml) Insulin, and 0.01%
(2 mg/ml) selenium acid.

RNA and protein extraction
To screen for correlative expression, total RNA
and protein were extracted in parallel from the same
samples using an RNA/DNA/protein purification kit
(Norgen). In other experiments, total RNA was extracted
using RNeasy kits (Qiagen) with on-column DNase
digestion. Fractionated protein extracts were prepared
by sequential extraction in NP-40 buffer (0.5% NP-40,
25 mM Tris pH7.9, 150 mM NaCl), Dignam buffer C
(20 mM HEPES pH7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 mM NaCl,
1.5 mM MgCl, 0.2 mM EDTA) and Laemmli buffer (50
mM Tris pH6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol). Alternatively,
whole cell protein extracts were prepared by direct
addition to cells of hot Laemmli buffer and incubation
at 110°C for 10mins with intermittent vortexing. The
protein concentration of each sample was determined
after suitable dilution using a Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA)
assay (Thermo Scientific).

Quantitative RT-PCR

(SI03036390) were used for follow-up studies together
with hs_HDAC1_6 (SI02663472) and hs_HDAC2_1
(SI00434952) (Qiagen). Non-targeting control siRNAs
used were siC (AllStars, Qiagen), and siCON1 (D001210–01) or siCON2 (D-001210–02) from Dharmacon.
For immunoblotting experiments, cells were seeded at
6x104 (A549 and NCI-H460) or 1.5x105 (MSTO-211H
and COR-L23) cells per well in 6-well plates, respectively,
transfected the following day with 40 nM siRNA using
Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), and harvested after 72 hr.

cDNA was reverse transcribed from 1 μg RNA
with RevertAid H-minus M-MuLV reverse transcriptase
(Fermentas) using an oligodT primer (Promega).
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed
in triplicate using SYBR Green Supermix and a real-time
PCR detection system (Bio-rad). The primer pairs used were:
BAP1 (For: 5′-CAGCCCTGAGAGCAAAGGATATG-3′,
Rev: 5′-ATGGTCCGCACTGCACTAAG-3′), HDAC1
(For: 5′-ACGGGATTGATGACGAGTCCTATG-3′, Rev:
5′-TGAGCCACACTGTAAGACCACC-3′), HDAC2 (For:
5′-TTACTGATGCTTGGAGGAGGTGGC-3′, Rev: 5′- TGG
ACACCAGGTGCATGAGGTAAC-3′) and β-actin (ACTB,
For: 5′-CACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCGTGTG-3′, Rev:
5′-ATAGCACAGCCTGGATAGCAACGTAC-3′). Samples
underwent 2-step amplification at 94°C (30 s) and 60°C
(60 s); melt curves were analyzed after 40 cycles. The Cq
values for test genes were normalized to ACTB and relative
expression represented as 2-[∆∆Cq].

Inhibitors
Cells were treated with the following HDAC
inhibitors: pan-HDAC vorinostat (Selleck) and tricho­
statin A (TSA, Sigma), class I selective mocetinostat
(MGCD01032, Selleck) and class IIa selective MC1568
(Selleck). In cyclo­
heximide chase experiments,
cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to cells at 10 μg/
ml for periods of up to 6 hr. In proteasome inhibition
experiments, epoxomicin (Calbiochem) was added to
cells at 50 nM for 6 hr.

Immunoblotting and antibodies
Equal amounts of lysates for comparator samples
were subject to immunoblotting. Following resolution by
10% SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to BiotraceNT
membrane (VWR) and incubated with primary antibodies.
Antibodies used were: mouse anti-BAP1 (C-4, Santa
Cruz), anti-P53 (sc-126, Santa Cruz) and anti-β-actin
(ab6276, Abcam), rabbit anti-HDAC2 (H54, Santa Cruz),
goat anti-HDAC1 (C19, Santa Cruz). Proteins were
visualized using donkey anti-mouse, anti-rabbit or antisheep secondary antibodies conjugated to the IRDyes
IR680-LT, or IR800 (LI-COR) and the LI-COR Odyssey
2.1 system; 16-bit images were analyzed and quantified
using the Odyssey analysis software.

HDAC activity assay
A549 or MSTO-211H cells were seeded in 96well plates at a density of 4000 or 6000 cells per well,
respectively. Treatment with 250 nM TSA for 16 hr, or
5 μM vorinostat for 2 hr, was used a positive control
in siRNA experiments. Cells were reverse transfected
using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) with 20 nM
siRNAs targeting HDACs or DUBs, or a non-targeting
siRNA (siC) or reagent only (mock). Total cellular HDAC
activity was assayed 48 hr later using the HDAC GloI/
II Assay (Promega) in non-lytic format and normalized
for cell viability. Parallel lysates were collected from 96well plates for immunoblotting; equivalent volumes were
loaded without BCA assay.

RNA interference and DUB siRNA library screen
A custom designed DUB siRNA library consisting
of pools of four oligos for each of 92 human DUBs
(Qiagen) and control siRNAs were previously used to
prepare a library of fractionated protein extracts from
A549 cells [14]. To screen for the effect of each DUB
on HDAC levels, samples from this nuclear extract
library were divided across four 4%–12% gradient
gels that were run and processed in parallel. Following
immunoblotting, the HDACs were imaged in separate
channels and bands were quantified using the Odyssey
system; the amount of HDAC2 was expressed relative to
the amount of HDAC1. The value for each sample was
then normalized to the median value for the corresponding
immunoblot. Mean values were derived from two
independent immunoblotting runs, before collation and
ranking of the dataset. The individual siRNA sequences
from each pool were used for initial validation. Two of
these siRNAs hs_BAP1_3 (SI00066710) and hs_BAP1_5

Cell viability assays
The cellular toxicity of HDAC inhibitors was titrated
in untransfected mesothelioma cell lines. For knockdown
experiments, 4000 MSTO-211H cells were seeded into 96well plates and reverse transfected for 72 hr with 20 nM
siRNA using RNAiMax. Cells were treated with vehicle
(0.1% DMSO) or HDAC inhibitors at their LC30 (2.5 μM
vorinostat, 1.25 μM mocetinostat, 20 μM MC1568) for
the final 48 hr prior to analysis, with the media and drug
replaced every 24 hr. The relative number of viable cells
were determined, based on proportionality with the amount
of ATP present, using the CellTitre-Glo assay (Promega).

Statistics
All statistical tests were performed using GraphPad
Prism version 6.00 for Mac.
