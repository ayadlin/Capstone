ABSTRACT
Purpose: To evaluate the influence of concurrent trastuzumab on the
cardiotoxicity in patients receiving left-sided adjuvant radiotherapy.
Materials and Methods: Medical records of stage I-III left-sided breast cancer
patients, including 64 receiving concurrent trastuzumab with radiotherapy and 73
receiving radiotherapy alone were retrospectively reviewed. All of the patients had
normal LVEF after adjuvant chemotherapy. Information of doses volume to cardiac
structures was collected. Cardiac events were assessed according to CTC 2.0.
Results: Median follow-up of LVEF and clinical assessment of cardiac function
from the initiation of radiotherapy was 6.7 months (range 3–60.9) and 26 months
(range 6.4–60.9), respectively. Grade 1 LVEF dysfunction occurred in 5 (7.8%) and
3 (4.1%) patients of the concurrent-trastuzumab and radiotherapy alone cohort,
respectively. Trastuzumab was the only significant factor influencing absolute LVEF
decrease in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis of concurrent-trastuzumab
cohort, IMC radiotherapy and start trastuzumab during radiotherapy were independent
risk factors. For concurrent cohort, mean heart dose, as well as D10-D30, D50-D55, V5-V20
of the heart and D30-D45, D65-D75, V6-V15 of the LV were significantly higher in patients
developing LVEF dysfunction.
Conclusions: Concurrent trastuzumab and left-sided radiotherapy is well tolerated
in terms of cardiotoxicity in patients with normal baseline cardiac function after
adjuvant chemotherapy. However, increases in mean dose and low–dose volume of
cardiac structures are associated with a higher risk of acute LVEF dysfunction.

INTRODUCTION

cardiac damage persists, especially in patients with leftsided breast cancer.
HER2 is expressed or amplified in about 25% of
breast cancers, and is associated with increased risk for
recurrence and mortality [10-12]. Trastuzumab (Herceptin;
Roche, Basel, Switzerland), a HER2-directed humanized
monoclonal antibody, has been shown to improve both
disease-free and overall survival in HER2-positive
(HER2+) breast cancer patients [13]. The most common
toxicity reported from trastuzumab is cardiotoxicity

Radiation therapy (RT) has been established to be
an important treatment strategy after breast conservative
surgery or after mastectomy in node positive patients [13]. One of the major toxicities of RT is cardiotoxicity,
resulting in an increase of non-breast cancer related
mortality [3-5]. Modern techniques have allowed much
better protection of the heart [6-9]. However, as heart lies
just below the chest wall, the risk of radiation-induced

[11], which presents most frequently in the form of
asymptomatic decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF) [14].
Benefit of trastuzumab is higher when administrated
as soon as possible and concurrently with adjuvant
chemotherapy [15, 16]. Therefore, adjuvant RT is often
delivered concurrently with adjuvant trastuzumab. RT
associated cardiotoxicity has been reported as a result
of damage to micro- and macro-vascular structures [17,
18]. There are much fewer reports about mechanisms of
trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity. In animal studies,
it was found to cause dilated cardiomyopathy through
inhibition of HER2 receptor [19]. In most cases, LVEF
recovers to normal but not always baseline level after
trastuzumab is discontinued without cardiologic treatment
[20, 21]. It is possible that heart exposed to trastuzumab is
more susceptible to the damage from ionizing irradiation.
Radiation-related cardiotoxicity depends mainly on
the dose volumes of the heart irradiated [22]. In a previous
retrospective study, our group found a positive association
between the dose volumes histograms of cardiac structures
and early cardiotoxicity in left-sided breast cancer patients

receiving concurrent trastuzumab and RT. [23]. However,
the limited sample size (enrolling only 24 left-sided breast
cancer patients) has limited us from extrapolating the
dose-volume recommendation.
The main objective of this study was first, to
evaluate the influence of concurrent trastuzumab on the
cardiotoxicity in patients receiving left-sided adjuvant RT.
Second, to explore the detailed dosimetric information
with regard to the acute systolic dysfunction, so as to
provide information for future practical recommendations
of dose-volume constraints in that specific clinical
scenario.

enrolled in this analysis. Clinical features of the 137
patients according to trastuzumab treatment are shown
in Table 1. The two cohorts were similar in age, BMI,
comorbidity, menopausal status and clinical-pathologic
stage. No patient was active smoker. All patients who
received concurrent trastuzumab had HER2+ invasive
ductal carcinoma. Compared with those receiving no
trastuzumab, the proportion of hormone receptor (HR)
negativity was higher in patients who received concurrent
trastuzumab (P = 0.01).

Systemic and locoregional treatments are detailed
in Table 2. There was no significant difference in the
frequency of anthracycline-based chemotherapy and
cumulative dose of anthracycline between the concurrenttrastuzumab and no-trastuzumab cohort in both the
neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting. Patients with HR
positive disease were less likely to receive hormone
therapy in the concurrent-trastuzumab cohort (P = 0.005).
This might be due to more cases with HR positive of
1% to 9% in the concurrent-trastuzumab cohort (6 of 64
patients) compared with the no-trastuzumab cohort (0 of

of LVEF dysfunction between the concurrent-trastuzumab
and no-trastuzumab cohort (7.8% versus 4.1%; P =
0.473). No patient presented chronic heart failure (CHF)
or any cardiac symptoms whether they were or were not
treated with trastuzumab. At the time of the last followup, LVEF of all patients recovered to normal (≥ 50%). In
the concurrent-trastuzumab and non-trastuzumab cohort,
the median time to recovery was 3.16 months and 3.33
months, respectively.
One patient stopped trastuzumab for developing
pericardial effusion and chest pain after 15 cycles of
3-weekly scheme and 5 months after completion of RT.
This is a 69-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus, but
with no other cardiac risk factors. She had a T1N3 breast
cancer with a baseline LVEF of 67% and received chest
wall and Supraclavicular (SCV) irradiation of 50Gy. She
was treated with 6 cycles of docetaxel and carboplatin
adjuvant chemotherapy concurrently with trastuzumab.
She did not developed LVEF dysfunction during the
follow-up until 31 months from the initiation of RT.
Her pericardial effusion was self-limited and recovered
1 month after stop of trastuzumab. The mean dose to
the heart and left ventricle (LV) were 491.94cGy and
745.6cGy, respectively. The V30 of the heart and LV were
5% and 8%, respectively.

73 patients) (P = 0.01). Internal mammary chain (IMC) RT
was associated with significantly higher cardiac dose, the
mean heart dose and mean dose to the LV was 1150.5 ±
230.9 cGy versus 568.9 ± 205.4 cGy(P = 0.000) and
1109.7 ± 397.9cGy versus 810.8 ± 276.1cGy(P = 0.013)
respectively in patients with and without IMC RT. The
proportion of IMC RT was lower in patients who received
concurrent trastuzumab compared with those who did
not receive trastuzumab (10.9% versus 31.5%, P = 0.004,
Table 2).
Trastuzumab was started, with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, with adjuvant chemotherapy, before
initiation of RT and with RT in 10, 39, 6 and 9 patients,
respectively. Trastuzumab regimen was consistent
with chemotherapy schedule, which was administrated
every 3 weeks and weekly in one and 9 patients during
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, in 29 and 22 patients during
adjuvant chemotherapy, respectively. All patients then
received trastuzumab every 3 weeks during and after
RT. There were four patients receiving concurrent
administration of trastuzumab and anthracycline in the
adjuvant setting. The median age of these four patients
was 38.5 years (range 26-51). Sixty-three of the 64
patients completed 1-year trastuzumab as planned.

Cardiac risk factors

Median follow-up of LVEF and clinical assessment
of cardiac function from the initiation of RT was 6.7
months (range 3-60.9 months) and 26 months (range 6.460.9 months), respectively. In the concurrent-trastuzumab
and non-trastuzumab cohort, the median absolute LVEF
decrease from baseline to the lowest measured value after
RT was 3% overall (range 7% increase to 15% decrease)
and 1% overall (range 13% increase to 13% decrease),
respectively. Grade 1 LVEF dysfunction (an asymptomatic
decline in LVEF of at least 10% but less than 20% from
baseline) occurred in 5 (7.8%) and 3 (4.1%) patients
respectively. There was no significant difference in the rate

Univariate analysis tested the effect of different
patient- and treatment-related factors on the risk of LVEF
dysfunction in patients treated with left-sided RT (Table
3). In the whole cohort, concurrent trastuzumab treatment
was the only significant risk factor for absolute decrease
of LVEF (P = 0.006), even if the rate of LVEF dysfunction
did not differ significantly with regard to whether
concurrent trastuzumab was given or not. Nor did the
cumulative dose of anthracycline and IMC RT affect the
rate of LVEF dysfunction. In the concurrent-trastuzumab
cohort, IMC RT was of borderline significance (P =

between the dose-volume of cardiac structures irradiated
and the risk of early cardiac toxicity in patients treated
with concurrent trastuzumab and left-sided RT, which has
been shown in our previous study[23].
Within 7-month median follow-up of LVEF, only
five out of 64 patients (7.8%) developed grade 1 LVEF
dysfunction after concurrent trastuzumab and left-sided
RT. Only one patient presented self-limited pericardial
effusion 5 months after completion of RT and no one
developed CHF. In a reanalysis of adverse events data
from the N9831 trial, the reported cumulative incidence
of CHF and cardiac death was between 1.7% and 2.7%
in the trastuzumab group [24]. Within a median followup of 16 months, Belkacemi et al. [25] [26] found that 9
of 92 patients developed a grade ≥ 2 of LVEF decrease
after concurrent trastuzumab with RT. Shaffer et al. [27]
reported that 18.5% patients stopped trastuzumab due
to cardiac events after concurrent left-sided RT during a
median follow-up of 15 months. The frequency of cardiac
toxicity in our study seems much lower than previous
reports. As follow up time of our study is relatively shorter
than prior studies, some of the cardiac injury may still
remain in sub-clinical phase, which would underestimate
the actual cardiac events. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy
(IMRT) has shown promising results as a cardiac sparing
technique for breast cancer patients in several reports [28].
All cases in our study were treated with IMRT, which
allowed for better cardiac protection and might therefore
reduce the risk of cardiotoxicity. Old age (≥ 60 years) has
been reported to be associated with increased trastuzumab
related-LVEF dysfunction [29]. Only 6 patients (9.3%)
were 60 years old or above in our study, which might also
contribute to the low cardiotoxicity incidence.
So far, published studies indicated that concurrent
administration of RT and trastuzumab is safe for the
heart. . However, so far, no study has ever done a
straight comparison between concurrent trastuzumab
with left-sided RT and left-sided RT alone. Our data
showed that concurrent trastuzumab treatment was the
only significant risk factor for absolute LVEF decrease
(mean 2.9±4.8% versus 0.5±4.9%, P = 0.006). The
rate of LVEF dysfunction in patients who received
concurrent trastuzumab was almost twice as high as
in their counterparts (7.8% versus 4.1%), even though
without significant difference. More patients in the nontrastuzumab cohort received IMC RT, which might partly
offset the difference of cardiac toxicity risk. Comparable
to our findings, in the N9831 trial, the rate of cardiac
events was 2.2% in the trastuzumab group and 0.4% in
the non-trastuzumab group after a median follow-up time
of 3.7 years. But left-sided patients were not analyzed
in isolation in that study. To date, concurrent treatment
of trastuzumab and left-sided RT is reported to be well
tolerated, nevertheless, our data cautioned that the impact
of concurrent trastuzumab on the risk of RT-related cardiac
toxicity might exist to some extent, which warrants further

0.088) in increasing the rate of LVEF dysfunction. Start
trastuzumab during the period of RT instead of before
RT increased the risk of LVEF dysfunction, although
statistical significance was not found (22.2% versus
5.5%, P = 0.141). Young age (< 47 years) and pre/perimenopause significantly increased the risk of LVEF
absolute decrease. Neither cumulative dose of trastuzumab
before nor during RT significantly influenced the risk of
LVEF dysfunction.
Multivariate analysis of risk factors for LVEF
dysfunction was shown in Table 4. In 64 patients
treated with concurrent trastuzumab, IMC RT and start
trastuzumab during RT were found to be independent
significant cardiac risk factors. In all 137 patients who
received left-sided RT, concurrent trastuzumab treatment
increased risk of LVEF dysfunction, but without statistical
significance (P = 0.365).

Dosimetric analysis in patients with concurrent
treatment
The average value of Dose-volume histogram
(DVH) parameters of the heart and LV was summarized in
Figure 1. The mean doses to the heart and LV were 633.5
± 276.4c Gy and 843.9 ± 303.1cGy, respectively.
The average mean dose delivered to the heart
was significantly higher in those developing LVEF
dysfunction compared to those with no observed cardiac
toxicity (936.1± 333.7cGy versus 607.5 ± 258.3cGy; P
= 0.01). Further analysis to compare the average value
of dose-volume parameters of the heart and LV between
patients with and without LVEF dysfunction found
that, for the heart, D10-D30, D50-D55 and V5 -V20 were
significantly higher in patients who developed LVEF
dysfunction (all P < 0.05, Figure 2A and 2C). As to the
LV, a continuous increase of D30-D45, D65-D75 and V6-V15
was also statistically significant in patients with LVEF
dysfunction (all P < 0.05, Figure 2B and 2D). In multiple
logistic regression analysis of all above statistically
significant dose-volume histogram parameters, V10 of the
LV was showed to be the best predictive factor for LVEF
dysfunction in the setting of concurrent treatment. The V10
of the LV was 33.4±17.3% and 16.3±12.7% in patients
with and without LVEF dysfunction, respectively (P =
0.01).

DISCUSSION
Our data demonstrated that in patients with normal
baseline cardiac function after adjuvant chemotherapy,
concurrent administration of trastuzumab and left-sided
RT was well tolerated using modern techniques, with a
7.8% grade 1 LVEF dysfunction rate in the concurrenttrastuzumab cohort and a 4.1% rate in the no-trastuzumab
cohort. We also further confirmed a direct relationship

Detailed information of radiation doses received
by cardiac structures was considered to be of paramount
importance for a better correlation to the cardiotoxicity
of concurrent trastuzumab and RT. To our knowledge,
a retrospective study reported by Shaffer et al [27] is
the only study prior to our work exploring this issue,
which found no significant correlation. However, in
this study irradiation techniques and dose fractionation

were heterogeneous and the DVH data of the heart were
undetailed, which would limit the applicability of the
conclusion. Recently, our group published a study, which
for the first time established a direct association between
dose-volume of cardiac structures and frequency of early
cardiac toxicity in the setting of concurrent trastuzumab
and left-sided RT. After that study, we continually enrolled
new patients such that our finding could be strengthened
and extrapolated. In a series of 64 left-sided patients

receiving concurrent trastuzumab, the association between
dose-volume of cardiac structures and early cardiac
toxicity was confirmed, which might provide information
for practical recommendations with regard to dose
constraints in treatment planning. The mean heart dose
was significantly higher in those who developed LVEF
dysfunction (936.1 ± 333.7cGy versus 607.5 ± 258.3cG
y, P = 0.01). Darby et al. [30] reported that increase of
cardiac events was proportional to mean heart dose. In the
era of comprehensive treatment, several systemic agents
might also increase the risk of cardiac damage in the
setting of concurrent trastuzumab and radiation therapy. A
high cumulative dose and concurrent use of anthracycline
were shown to increase the risk of trastuzumab-associated
cardiotoxicity [31]. In recent years, the improvements in
breast cancer RT have kept the irradiation exposure of the
heart at a very low level [8]. Nevertheless, even in such
context our data suggested that constraint of the dosevolume of cardiac structures irradiated would remain an
effective protective strategy for the heart.
In this study, DVH parameters that significantly
correlated with the risk of LVEF dysfunction referred
mainly to the low-intermediate dose volumes of the heart,
with D10-D30, D50-D55 and V5-V20 of the heart and D30-D45,
D65-D75 and V6-V15 of the LV. The clinical significance
of relatively low dose volumes of the heart was seldom
reported and controversial. In 32 breast cancer patients
treated with left-sided RT, Chung et al. [32] found no
correlation for perfusion and very low doses (mean heart
dose < 5 Gy and D95) delivered to cardiac structures. IMRT
has been introduced in the breast cancer RT to improve
dose homogeneity in the breast as well as to reduce
cardiac dose [28]. Compared with three-dimensional
conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), IMRT significantly
changed the pattern of irradiated dose distribution to the
heart with increased mean dose and low dose volumes and
decrease in high dose volumes [34, 35]. Currently there is
no consensus whether such increase in low-dose volume
is detrimental for heart, although it has become the major
pitfall of IMRT being accepted as standard practice in
breast RT. Further to our previous study, V10 of the LV,
which represented low dose-volume, was found to be a
significant prognostic factor of LVEF dysfunction. The
absolute value of V10 in patients with LVEF dysfunction
was two times as high as in patients with normal LVEF
(33.4±17.3% versus 16.3±12.7%). Even if it maybe not
yet to define one single dosimetric value as threshold,
information from our study, together with future data,
will help to develop a practical algorithm of dose-volume
recommendations in IMRT of the left breast in the
background of modern multidisciplinary treatment.
Despite the fact that IMC was part of the regional
nodes irradiated in randomized trials that have proved
the survival benefit of post-mastectomy radiotherapy in
node-positive breast cancer patients [36-40], as well as
in the recent published EORTC 22922/10925 and MA 20
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

trials which have proved that regional nodes irradiation
in addition to breast/chest wall irradiation significantly
improved distant disease-free survival in node-positive
and high-risk node negative patients [41, 42], the benefit
of IMC RT as part of regional RT is still controversial.
Whatever technique to choose, IMC RT, more or less, is
associated with an extra exposure of cardiac structures.
Acute cardiotoxicity of concurrent trastuzumab and RT
including IMC has been explored in several studies, with
controversial results. In a retrospective study, Shaffer et al.
[27] found that cardiac events were even fewer in patients
who received left-sided IMC RT. By no means that IMC
RT would serve as a protective factor for heart. Such
counter-intuitive result may be due to small sample and
bias in the selection of IMC RT. In another prospective
study, 88 out of 106 patients received IMC RT, including
40 patients with left-sided breast cancer [43]. After a
median follow-up of 28 months, 5 patients developed ≥
grade 2 left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The frequency
of cardiac events was much higher than our results, which
might indirectly reflect the detrimental effect of IMC
RT. Our current study for the first time proved that leftsided IMC RT, in concurrent with trastuzumab, was an
independent risk factor for LVEF dysfunction. Therefore,
cardiac volume sparing and strict selection of high risk
IMC irradiation are highly recommended [25].
Another phenomenon we observed was that the
sequence of trastuzumab and RT was an independent risk
factor influencing the cardiac toxicity. Start trastuzumab
during the period of RT was associated with a higher risk
of LVEF dysfunction, compared with start trastuzumab
before the initiation of RT. As the baseline LVEF was
assessed before RT, those who started trastuzumab
during RT were almost simultaneously exposed to double
cardiotoxic therapeutic modalities, which was quite
different from those who exposed to trastuzumab first and
RT subsequently. This result suggested that trastuzumab
and left-sided RT have at least combined effect on cardiac
toxicity. Therefore, those trastuzumab naïve patients who
were not assessed for potential tolerance of trastuzumab
and, prepared to double treatments might require stricter
dose-volume constraints in treatment planning.
The main limitation of current study is that
LVEF is not sensitive enough to detect early and minor
cardiac dysfunction, thus the actual toxicity might
be underestimated. Our group has also explored the
role of diastolic function in monitoring early cardiac
abnormalities under the same clinical scenario [44].
Nevertheless, as a fundamental parameter of cardiac
function, LVEF is less susceptible to intra-observer
differences. Therefore, LVEF would remain as the golden
standard for monitoring cardiac function under current
therapeutic modality [14]. New diagnostic modalities
such as myocardial deformation imaging or biomarkers
might help detect cardiac toxicity at an earlier stage [4547]. In addition, biomarker such as HER2 [Ile655Val]
1050

genetic polymorphism and troponin I might help identify
patients at high risk of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity
[48, 49]. Several agents have been reported to ameliorate
anthracycline associated cardiac toxicity, such as
composite polymer nanoparticle and dihydromyricetin [50,
51]. Whether there agents will ameliorate trastuzumabor radiation-associated cardiotoxicity needs further
exploration. The median follow-up period of 26 months
in this study is still too short. Considering the very long
latent period of RT-induced cardiac toxicity, as well as
the unclear long-term impact of trastuzumab on cardiac
function, patients should be followed-up regularly for as
long as possible, so that the clinical impact of early LVEF
decrease will be further validated.

breast conserving patients. SCV and IMC lymph nodes
irradiation were given at the discretion of the radiation
oncologist. No scar boost was used in patients receiving
chest wall RT. All patients underwent CT-simulation in a
supine position, immobilized on a breast board (Med-Tec,
Inc. Orange City, IA, USA) with both arms abducted and
raised overhead. For chest wall RT, field-in-field forwardplanned intensity-modulated radiotherapy (FiF-IMRT)
was used [53]. Breast RT was performed with simplified
multi-field inverse-planned IMRT (sIMRT), which was
described in details in a previous publication [23]. For
patients treated with sIMRT, irradiation of SCV and IMC
lymph nodes was integrated into sIMRT plan. For patients
treated with FiF-IMRT, an anterior mixed photon and
electron beam was used.
Cardiac structures were delineated according to
the heart atlas published by Feng et al.[54]. A radiation
oncologist, under supervision of a radiologist, deliberately
contoured the whole heart and LV. DVH parameters of
the heart and LV were calculated using individual dose
distribution data in the RT planning system (ADAC
Pinnacle 3, versions 8.0m). DVH parameters of the heart
and the LV were collected and included the minimum dose
reaching relative volume levels ranging from 1% to 95%
(D1 to D95) and the percentage of volume exceeding 1 to
50 Gy (V1 to V50). As contribution of the tumor bed boost
and SCV irradiation to the heart dose was very low [55,
56], adjustments for cardiac dose were not carried out for
these patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The medical records of patients treated with
adjuvant RT for left-sided stage I-III (AJCC, 7th [52])
breast cancer between February 2009 and September
2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with HER2+
disease (immunohistochemistry score 3 or fluorescence in
situ hybridization positive) and also node-positive or highrisk node-negative disease were eligible for treatment with
trastuzumab. Normal LVEF ( ≥ 50%) before the initiation
of trastuzumab and RT were required. Demographic
data and potential cardiac risk factors were collected,
as well as histopathological, systemic and locoregional
treatment details. The research protocol was reviewed
and approved by the Ethical Committee and Institutional
Review Board of the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer
Center (FDSCC). All patients in FDSCC provided written
informed consent.

Statistical analysis
Cardiac event was evaluated according to LVEF
decrease from the baseline measure. The LVEF measured
by echocardiogram and/or multiple gated acquisition scan
(MUGA). This assessment, combined with the clinical
assessment of cardiac function, was performed before
initiation of RT and every 3 to 6 months after RT for the
first 5 years and annually thereafter. Cardiac event (grade
≥ 1) assessed according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC, version 2.0).
Comparisons between groups were assessed
using the chi-squared test (or Fisher’s exact test) for
categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U test for
quantitative variables. Comparison between groups for
dosimetric details was analyzed using the Student’s t-test.
A stepwise backward procedure was used to construct
a set of independent risk factors of cardiac events. All
factors achieving a P value < 0.10 were considered and
sequentially removed if the P value in the multiple models
was > 0.05. All P values were two-sided, P < 0.05 was
considered significant. SPSS software version 21.0 was
used.

Systemic treatment
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administrated
in patients with a primary diagnosis of stage IIA-IIIA
disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy was decided by the
multidisciplinary breast cancer team. Hormonal therapy
was given to patients with HR positive breast cancers as
determined by immunohistochemistry ( > 1% positive).
Trastuzumab was administered every 3 weeks (6 mg/kg
after a first cycle of 8 mg/kg) or every week (2 mg/kg after
a first cycle of 4 mg/kg).

Radiotherapy and dosimetric analysis
RT was delivered to the whole breast or chest
wall (50 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks). Tumor bed boost
of 10 Gy in 5 fractions was given using electron for
