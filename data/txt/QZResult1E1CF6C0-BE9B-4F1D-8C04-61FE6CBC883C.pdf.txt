Abstract
Recent therapeutic advances in oncology have been driven by the identification of tumour
genotype variations between patients, called interpatient heterogeneity, that predict the response of
patients to targeted treatments. Subpopulations of cancer cells with unique genomes in the same
patient may exist across different geographical regions of a tumour or evolve over time, called
intratumour heterogeneity. Sequencing technologies can be used to characterize intratumour
heterogeneity at diagnosis, monitor clonal dynamics during treatment and identify the emergence
of clinical resistance during disease progression. Genetic interpatient and intratumour
heterogeneity can pose challenges for the design of clinical trials that use these data.

There is great promise that knowledge of the biological drivers of cancer will lead to
personalized cancer treatment. Oncologists increasingly use molecular characterization of a
sample of primary or metastatic tumour to guide their selection of treatments for an
individual patient. However, they usually rely on a limited sample of cancer tissue that
cannot represent heterogeneity between and within patients.

Cancer genomics studies, including large-scale collaborative sequencing projects such as
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium
(ICGC), have catalogued genetic interpatient tumour heterogeneity for cancers of the same
histological subtype. Non-genetic phenotypic and functional heterogeneity is also well
recognized (see the Review by Meacham and Morrison on page 328), as is heterogeneity of
the tumour microenvironment (see the Review by Junttila and de Sauvage on page 346).
Comprehensive characterization of multiple tumour specimens obtained from the same
patient illustrates that remarkable intratumour heterogeneity might exist between
geographical regions in the same tumour (spatial heterogeneity), as well as between the
primary tumour and a subsequent local or distant recurrence in the same patient (temporal
heterogeneity). Inter- and intratumour heterogeneity pose a challenge to personalized cancer

medicine because a single needle biopsy or surgical excision is unlikely to accurately
capture the complete genomic landscape of a patient’s cancer. Genomic characterization of
cell-free circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) or circulating tumour cells (CTCs) may offer an
opportunity to assess clonal dynamics throughout the course of a patient’s illness and
identify drivers of therapeutic resistance. Here, we review the clinical implications of
interpatient and intratumour heterogeneity for cancer diagnosis, making a prognosis,
treatment selection and resistance. We discuss how clinical trials that are restricted to
molecular subtypes of cancer could incorporate studies of tumour heterogeneity so that we
can better understand the clinical impact of heterogeneity on therapeutic effectiveness and
the emergence of treatment resistance.

Current models for diagnosis and treatment
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Modern cancer treatment is based on accurate tissue diagnosis of samples obtained from
needle biopsy or surgical excision. Cancerous tissues are analysed under a light microscope
to evaluate histopathology, and immunostaining and selected molecular tests are used to
establish a specific cancer diagnosis. Treatment is based on the anatomical location and
tissue of origin of the primary tumour when cancer is localized to an organ site or when
cancer has metastasized and the primary site can be identified by imaging or pathological
examination. When solid tumours recur after treatment for localized disease or progress after
systemic treatment for metastatic disease, taking another biopsy to guide treatment decisions
is not routine1. Instead, further systemic treatment of patients with progressive metastatic
disease is typically based on the identification of predictive biomarkers in archived primary
specimens, which may no longer represent the current disease such as BRAF mutation in
melanoma, HER2 (also known as ERBB2) amplification or overexpression in breast cancer,
KRAS mutation in colorectal cancer and EGFR mutation in non-small-cell lung cancer2–6.

Intratumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution

Author Manuscript

The current approach to molecular biomarker testing to inform cancer treatment focuses on
interpatient tumour heterogeneity. However, there is a growing recognition that intratumour
heterogeneity within the same patient is clinically relevant because the status of predictive
biomarkers that are used for making clinical decisions may evolve during tumour
progression, in particular metastatic dissemination of the primary tumour to a distant organ
or for established metastatic disease under the selection pressure of treatment. Nowell’s
theory of clonal evolution states that cancers arise from a single cell of origin, develop
genomic instability during replication and then undergo enrichment for the most aggressive
clones through the processes of metastasis and the eradication of sensitive clones with
cancer treatment7 (see the Reviews by Burrell et al. on page 338 and Klein on page 365). For
example, discordance between oestrogen receptor (ER) expression in a primary breast
cancer and subsequent distant metastases that may appear many years after completion of
primary treatment is observed in 7–25% of patients8–11 (Table 1). Change in ER status may
have important implications for treatment because patients with tumours that lack ER
expression do not benefit from treatment with endocrine therapy such as tamoxifen or
aromatase inhibitors12. Loss of ER or HER2 expression in breast cancer during metastasis is
associated with a poorer outcome13,14. Although data from other tumour types are more

limited, discordance of prognostic or predictive biomarker testing results between the
primary tumour and metastases has been reported in other settings15–24 (Table 1).

Author Manuscript

Before metastases are clinically apparent, clonal heterogeneity can be identified within the
primary tumour25. For example, complex patterns of HER2 gene amplification detected by
fluorescence in situ hybridization are seen in breast26 and gastro-oesophageal cancers27.
Similar patterns of regional intratumour heterogeneity have been observed with mutation
testing in other tumour types, including KRAS in colorectal cancer, BRAF in melanoma and
EGFR in non-small-cell lung cancer23,28–31. Intratumour heterogeneity may account for
resistance despite the matching of targeted treatment to the mutation, such as trastuzumab
for HER2 amplified breast cancer32, EGFR monoclonal antibody treatment for KRASwildtype-colorectal cancer33 and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment for EGFR mutant
non-small-cell lung cancer34, through the selection of clonal subpopulations with mutations
that confer treatment resistance.

Strategies to measure intratumour heterogeneity

Author Manuscript

Recognition of intratumour heterogeneity to inform treatment decisions requires test
methods that can be applied to clinical tumour samples. Genome-scale technologies provide
an unbiased characterization of clonal heterogeneity within tumours beyond a specific
genetic locus or a set of loci (see the Review by Burrell et al. on page 338). Studies with
karyotype analysis and comparative genomic hybridization allow for detection of clonal
subpopulations within the same tumour that can be differentiated on the basis of DNA
content and chromosomal imbalances35. Newer techniques such as single nucleotide
polymorphism arrays provide greater resolution and can identify smaller-scale allelic
imbalances in specific genetic loci. Next-generation sequencing technology allows for the
systematic enumeration of single nucleotide mutations and the identification of rare clonal
subpopulations that are present in a small fraction of tumour cells. Sequencing studies of
normal tissue, early pre-malignant precursors and malignant lesions derived from the same
patient have been performed in secondary acute myeloid leukaemia derived from
myelodysplastic syndrome36 and invasive breast cancer with adjacent pre-invasive
neoplasia37. Clonal lineage has been reconstructed with the identification of antecedent
founding clones in a pre-malignant precursor from which malignant disease evolved with the
outgrowth of subclones with additional genomic alterations37.

Author Manuscript

In metastatic disease, recent studies have characterized the emergence of treatment-resistant
subclones that were present at a minor frequency in the primary tumour38–44. This raises the
tantalizing possibility that the model of cancer diagnosis and treatment in the future could
involve characterization of subpopulations within the primary tumour45, monitoring of
clonal dynamics during treatment and eradication of treatment-emergent clones. Clinical
sequencing using less invasive sampling methods such as cytology specimens, CTC analysis
and ctDNA would greatly facilitate this approach42,43,46–52. A recent study52 demonstrated
that ctDNA detected using targeted gene sequencing for PIK3CA and TP53 mutations was
associated with survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Levels of ctDNA were
more closely correlated with response to treatment than CTCs or levels of the circulating
cancer antigen CA15-3 detected in serum53. A further study involving serial ctDNA exome

sequencing of six patients with advanced solid tumours demonstrated an increased
representation of certain mutant alleles with the emergence of treatment resistance54.

Challenges of clinical assessment
Beyond initial proof-of-concept studies, larger clinical efforts are required to evaluate
whether in-depth genomic characterization and serial monitoring of clonal dynamics leads to
better patient care. The falling cost of next-generation sequencing has made high-coverage
DNA sequencing of clinically relevant cancer genes accessible at the point of care55,56.
Genomic assessment of interpatient and intratumour heterogeneity in the clinical
environment57 has several practical challenges.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Surgical resections of primary tumours or metastatic lesions provide large volumes of
tumour tissue that are required for assessment of regional heterogeneity and clonal diversity.
Tumour specimens are routinely formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) after surgical
excision to preserve histology. Although tumour nucleic acids can degrade with formalin
fixation and this can limit researchers’ ability to perform genome-scale analyses, particularly
for RNA sequencing, advances in technology mean that the analysis is becoming more
feasible. In addition, deciphering the precise spatial orientation of stored FFPE tumour
blocks using the routine clinical annotation that is included in surgical pathology reports to
reconstruct intratumour heterogeneity can be difficult. Serial characterization of metastatic
lesions through core needle biopsy could be used to identify clonal evolution, but sampling
bias may occur because only a limited geographical region of a tumour is analysed. ctDNA
is more amenable to serial sampling and presumably represents cancer genomes from
multiple metastatic sites. However, ctDNA analysis is in its infancy and is not yet routinely
established in the clinical environment. Furthermore, whether there are important mutations
that are unique to non-circulating populations of tumour cells is not yet known.

In the United States, clinical laboratories that test human specimens for the purpose of
providing information on diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease to the supervising
physician must adhere to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards
and be accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) for reimbursement58, and
similar regulatory standards exist in other countries. Genome-scale sequencing was
previously outside the purview of a clinical laboratory owing to the cost of massively
parallel sequencing platforms, high-performance computing capacity and the sophisticated
bioinformatics expertise that was required for sequence alignment and mutation calling. The
recent development of bench-top next-generation sequencing instruments that offer high
coverage (≥250 × read depth) of a large targeted panel of clinically relevant cancer genes is
well suited to the work flow of a clinical laboratory59–61. The Next Generation Sequencing
Standardization of Clinical Testing (Nex-StoCT) workgroup recommends that all clinically
actionable mutations should be confirmed by independent analysis using an alternative
method before reporting to the treating clinician62. This poses a problem when highcoverage next-generation sequencing identifies a low-frequency mutation that cannot be
confirmed by Sanger or PCR sequencing owing to the limitations of sensitivity of direct
sequencing methods.

Mutation verification can delay the reporting of results to the oncologist if multiple
clinically actionable variants are detected by next-generation sequencing. Patients with
metastatic cancer and their oncologists may not be willing to wait for these results before
initiating a new treatment63. Deciding which mutation or mutations are clinically relevant,
prioritizing mutations for treatment matching when multiple mutations are detected and
developing a framework to report results to clinicians that can be easily interpreted are
complex tasks. Few mutations have been validated with a high level of evidence for the
prediction of treatment response64. Specific mutations may have different clinical
implications depending on a cancer’s tissue of origin, such as BRAF(V600E) mutation in
patients with melanoma or colorectal cancer65,66 and their response to vemurafenib
monotherapy. For mutations in tumour-specific contexts for which there are no clinical
studies available, preclinical drug sensitivity encyclopaedias can be mined to infer potential
clinical relevance67,68. However, there are concerns about validating predictive genomic
biomarkers across cell-line screening data sets69 and the lack of reproducibility of
preclinical experiments70.

Trial designs that assess tumour heterogeneity
Despite the challenges associated with genomic assessment in the clinical environment,
molecular characterization — from genotyping to targeted genome sequencing — through
the use of stored FFPE samples or serially procured fresh tumour biopsies is increasingly
used to complement histopathological diagnosis. Clinical-trial design frameworks for cancer
diagnostics and therapeutics must be developed to efficiently and dynamically incorporate
such genomic data and assess the value of matching profiled patients to specific
interventions or targeted therapies.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

There are several premises on which clinical-trial design frameworks in the cancer genome
era are based. First, genetic aberrations exist in human malignancies with a subset that are
present in different cancer types at variable frequencies. Aberrations with functional
relevance that lead to cancer initiation, growth and metastasis are the targets of greatest
clinical interest because they could potentially be used for diagnosis, prognosis and
predicting response to therapy. Second, there are specific interventions or tolerable
medicinal agents that may effectively modulate such targets. Last, intratumour heterogeneity
and clonal evolution occur and there are feasible technologies to measure these phenomena
in the clinical setting. The reliable quantification of both spatial and temporal variations in
the molecular landscape of cancers would enable the development of therapeutic strategies
to interrogate them. Although, currently, most approved targeted therapies and clinical trials
focus on interpatient heterogeneity, considering intratumour heterogeneity will increasingly
become important in the future.

Trial designs for interpatient heterogeneity
Clinical-trial design frameworks that focus on interpatient tumour heterogeneity are
possible, assuming that detailed genomic characterization is feasible71 (Fig. 1).

Longitudinal cohort with nested trials

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

One framework currently used by many large cancer institutions and national cancer
cooperative groups is to prospectively profile a large number of patients to establish a
longitudinal cohort with clinical annotation such as demographics, histopathological
diagnosis, earlier therapies and outcome (Table 2). Thus far, most clinical molecular
profiling programmes worldwide have focused on the genomic characterization of limited
but presumably representative specimens obtained at a single time point, typically in patients
with metastatic disease who are suitable for systemic therapy. It is logical that a current
sample would more accurately reflect the patient’s current disease than an archived sample,
although it is unknown whether a small current specimen (for example, from a needle
biopsy) is preferable to a larger historical sample (for example, from surgical resection). In
instances in which archived tumour tissue is too scant to yield sufficient DNA, or has been
exhausted owing to serial evaluations of single markers, then a fresh tumour biopsy would
be necessary for genomic profiling. Although there is great enthusiasm for molecular
characterization of tumour samples, the clinical use of this approach is still unproven. Some
clinical trials of targeted drugs limit enrolment to patients with specific molecular
perturbations; however, the effectiveness of such drugs is usually unconfirmed. Nonetheless,
the coupling of a molecular characterization strategy with a drug development programme
has been widely embraced, despite disparate results from different retrospective series and
the lack of definitive supportive data72,73. In this context, patients with specific molecular
aberrations are often ‘opportunistically’ enrolled into clinical trials of matching targeted
agents. This framework is attractive to those running large programmes who have access to a
robust panel of early phase clinical trials that test different molecular targets60,63,73–75. The
panel of clinical trials can be ‘nested’ or embedded as distinct research activities under the
auspices of an overarching platform of molecular profiling and target–drug matching.

Histology-based design

Author Manuscript

Other frameworks involve the evaluation of the target–agent matching strategy in large,
prospectively conducted clinical trials (Table 2). For instance, histology-based and
biomarker-integrated multicentre clinical trials aim to assess a variety of targeted agents
matched to specific molecular profiles within a single tumour type (Fig. 1a). The FOCUS 4
trial supported by the UK Medical Research Council, for example, will enrol patients with
advanced colorectal cancer who have responsive or stable disease after 16 weeks of
chemotherapy76. On molecular profiling, patients with tumours that harbour commonly
mutated oncogenes such as KRAS, BRAF or PIK3CA will be given targeted agents or a
placebo. Other histology-based clinical trials include the US-based BATTLE-2 trial
(NCT01248247) in lung cancer and the I-SPY 2 trial in breast cancer (NCT01042379)77–79
(Table 3).
Histology-agnostic, aberration-specific design
An alternative framework employs a histology-agnostic, aberration-specific design in which
patients whose tumours harbour identical or related molecular profiles are treated in the
same ‘basket’ with the same therapeutic regimen (Fig. 1b). An example is the inclusion of
different tumour types that harbour PIK3CA mutations or amplifications into a basket trial

that evaluates a PI(3)K α-isoform specific inhibitor (NCT01219699). This strategy may be
adapted to increase enrolment of patients with tumour types that demonstrate early signals of
antitumour activity while excluding those who lack preliminary response. Although this
framework will not directly lead to regulatory approval, given its exploratory nature, it does
provide a platform to determine the differences in functionality of the same molecular
alteration across multiple cancer types.
N-of-1 clinical trial design

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The N-of-1 clinical-trial design framework has been pursued for non-oncology diseases,
most frequently in neuropsychiatric, pulmonary and musculoskeletal conditions80,81. In their
standard context, N-of-1 trials involve individual patients who are typically blinded and
randomly assigned to different treatment regimens or to a placebo in different sequential
orders, with washout periods, in which patients receive no treatment, between regimen
alterations to minimize crossover effects (Fig. 1c). There are limitations to the application of
this framework in oncology. For instance, the switch from one regimen to another may occur
before there is sufficient time for antitumour activity to be manifested, such that there may
be an underestimation of therapeutic efficacy while increasing the risk of inducing drug
resistance. Modified N-of-1 designs have been used to investigate the value of individualized
therapy. The concept of using each individual patient as his or her own control, for example,
to assess the growth modulation index by comparing the time to progression or progressionfree survival (PFS) on a current regimen with that attained on the most recent prior
treatment, represents such a modification of the N-of-1 design82 (Fig. 1d). This framework
may become increasingly relevant for subsets of patients with rare molecular alterations, for
which large randomized trials may never be feasible. The WINTHER trial83
(NCT01856296), led by the Worldwide Innovative Networking (WIN) Consortium, is an
example of a modified N-of-1 design that is using a variety of advanced profiling
technologies to comprehensively characterize oncogenic events in 200 patients with different
cancers. The trial compares patients’ PFS on therapy guided by profiling results with that
achieved on the regimen immediately preceding trial enrolment. However, the validity of this
approach is unknown, given the uncertain correlation in PFS between sequential inactive
therapies82.

Trial designs for intratumour heterogeneity

Author Manuscript

Establishing clinical-trial design frameworks in the context of intrapatient tumour
heterogeneity and clonal evolution is challenging because dimensions of both space and time
must be incorporated to reflect the dynamic nature of tumour biological characteristics
within individuals.
Geographical heterogeneity
The execution of the aforementioned frameworks is typically based on molecular profiling
of tumour specimens obtained from one geographical location. These samples, in addition to
other biorepositories such as tissue banks and autopsy programmes, provide a means to build
knowledge bases that help us to gain insight into complex molecular events such as
intratumour heterogeneity40,84,85. One such initiative to build this type of knowledge base is

the REACT study (NCT01505400). The aim of this study is to genomically evaluate all
archived tumour samples from a cohort of molecularly profiled patients to assess
heterogeneity and clonal evolution.

Author Manuscript

To prospectively assess geographical or spatial heterogeneity, profiling of multiregional
tumour samples would be indicated. Although this is feasible (but rarely performed in
surgical resections), it is impractical and potentially risky to take biopsies from multiple
deep-seated metastatic lesions in every patient to examine the genotypes of different tumour
cell clones. If tumour biopsies using fine-gauge needles (23-gauge or smaller) could yield
sufficient quantities of tumour nucleic acids for molecular profiling, these would be an
attractive alternative to large-bore needles owing to the lower risk of procedure-related
complications. An ongoing prospective study called MATCH (NCT01703585) evaluating
the quality and quantity of DNA obtained using different sizes of biopsy needles, could
determine whether the use of fine-gauge needles is feasible for targeted sequencing. In
addition, there are prospective and retrospective tumour-specific programmes that explore
heterogeneity and evolution in relation to drug therapy (Table 3). The PREDICT programme
for patients with renal cell cancer who are treated with neoadjuvant everolimus or sunitinib
is an example of an explicitly designed study to evaluate heterogeneity in the primary
tumour through multiregional sampling86,87. Ultimately, the development of non-invasive
visualization techniques, such as molecular imaging using radionuclide-based methods that
can quantify the expression of tumoral targets with high sensitivity and specificity, would be
ideal88.
Temporal heterogeneity

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Serial tumour sampling, especially at crucial time points in the disease course such as the
development of metastatic disease or progression after initial response to systemic therapy,
may reveal the emergence of dominant clones. This type of dynamic examination of clonal
evolution is being conducted by programmes such as PREDICT86,87. Until less invasive
techniques such as characterization of CTCs or ctDNA are validated to yield sufficient
sensitivity and specificity to be representative of clonal distribution and evolutionary pattern,
fresh tumour biopsies will probably be used to monitor these events, although limited
biopsies may also not reflect the full genomic landscape89,90. Sensitivity of detection of
somatic mutations is related to their frequencies in the analysed segments of cancer-related
genes, and can be increased by using new techniques such as amplification and deep
sequencing of selected genomic regions. ctDNA has already been used as a tracking tool for
distinct existent clones51, as well as an early predictor of treatment response or
resistance42,43,52 . Optimization of these methods to transition them from research to
diagnostic laboratories would enable their applications in clinical trials and eventually in
routine cancer care. Advances in molecular imaging that would make longitudinal
surveillance possible would be desirable, although it is uncertain whether imaging can ever
provide resolution at the level of target expression in tumour cells and be able to reflect
changes in the clonal milieu.

Trial designs

Author Manuscript

The evaluation of geographical and temporal variations in tumour molecular profiles is
complex. Their integration into the aforementioned clinical-trial design frameworks that
focus on interpatient tumour heterogeneity is possible but would necessitate that the
frameworks become dynamic models that consider changes across space and time within
individuals. By using these frameworks, geographical heterogeneity and clonal evolution in
tumour samples can be prospectively measured, but must first be correlated with clinical
outcome to determine whether they portend a prognostic and/or predictive role.
Interventions to modulate these phenomena would only be planned if they are demonstrated
to have an important link to clinical outcome.

An example of intratumour heterogeneity in the clinic
Author Manuscript

Given the complexity of intratumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution, it is impossible to
provide approaches that are universally applicable. As such, in reality, it is expected that
adaptations of clinical trial designs for individuals will be tailored to the unique features of
specific malignancies. By using breast cancer as a example, practical applications of these
frameworks for prognosis and therapy (Table 4) are discussed below.
Pre-malignancy to malignancy

Author Manuscript

The establishment of a longitudinal cohort would enable long-term follow-up of patients
with pre-malignant lesions, such as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), for whom the disease
might progress to invasive breast cancer. Retrospective analyses of cases with synchronous
DCIS and invasive ductal carcinoma have shown that this progression is associated with the
appearance of subclones that harbour specific genetic aberrations, such as amplifications of
MYC, CCND1 and FGFR1 (refs 91–93). The prospective quantification of geographical and
temporal heterogeneity can be achieved by multiregional sampling of DCIS in surgical
specimens, and by serial sampling in cases of DCIS recurrence. The identification of
biomarkers of progression that may predict the transition from pre-malignancy to
malignancy would be relevant. A comparison of surveillance strategies with or without
molecular assessment of such biomarkers in different geographical locations and in serially
collected samples of pre-malignant lesions can be undertaken to validate their prognostic
role.
Metastatic potential of localized cancer

Author Manuscript

Both the longitudinal cohort strategy and the histology-based design to evaluate multiple
aberrations would be reasonable frameworks to consider for metastatic potential of localized
cancer. Comprehensive molecular portraits of the four main primary breast cancer subtypes
(luminal A, luminal B, basal-like and HER2-enriched) have recently been published94.
Multiregional sampling and molecular profiling of primary tumour and regional lymph
nodes can be carried out in patients who have undergone curative resections. In addition,
depending on the sensitivity of detection, CTCs can be enumerated and profiled, and ctDNA
can be extracted and analysed for the presence of somatic genomic alterations. Patients can
then be monitored prospectively to determine if the detection of specific biomarkers in
multiple locations within the primary surgical specimen or in the circulatory system can help

to identify those tumours with biologically aggressive behaviour beyond the prognosis given
by standard clinicopathologi-cal factors.
Monitoring for early micrometastases
After definitive local therapy and systemic adjuvant therapy, serial enumeration of CTCs or
prospective sequential profiling of ctDNA can be performed, either as a longitudinal cohort
or in a histology-based design to evaluate different molecular aberrations51. Single-cell
exome sequencing to detect single nucleotide mutations is being developed95–97, such that
molecular characterization using captured CTCs could eventually be possible98. These
samples can be used as a tracking tool for distinct existent clones that can be assessed to
monitor response to adjuvant therapy and to predict disease relapse.
Targeting oncogenic driver clones

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In patients who develop macroscopic metastases from breast cancer, current systemic
therapy consists mainly of hormonal therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy and a limited number
of targeted agents, such as HER2 inhibitors for HER2-positive tumours, or mTOR inhibitors
in hormone-receptor-positive tumours99. At present, other than HER2-targeting, selecting
treatment based on a molecular profile is not proven to be superior to standard algorithms in
metastatic breast cancer. As such, the design of therapeutic clinical trials that are either
histology-based or histology-agnostic to evaluate the benefit of target–drug matching
compared with conventional approaches, would be considered investigational. Exploring the
impact of intratumour heterogeneity in a therapeutic context adds a further layer of
complexity. Even if current technologies such as minimally invasive multiregional sampling
of metastases or molecular imaging are able to identify functional tumour subpopulations
that are geographically distinct, the design of clinical trials to interrogate these
subpopulations is challenging. For instance, if two potentially important clones, one with
PIK3CA mutations and the other with FGFR1 amplification coexist, then hypothetical
therapeutic possibilities can include either concurrent combination or sequential treatment
with PI(3)K and FGFR1 inhibitors (ideally distinguished using carefully designed
randomized trials). The accessibility to approved or experimental agents in such scenarios
may be limited. Furthermore, the most optimal approach to combine or sequence two or
more agents to yield sufficient biological target modulation with tolerable toxicity is often
undefined and requires dose-finding studies. Finally, even if appropriate drug combination
strategies are determined and can effectively suppress clonal evolution, thus ameliorating or
delaying the onset of resistance, a previously undetected or new driver clone may ultimately
arise. In contrast to the uncertainty of ‘drugging’ intratumour heterogeneity successfully, the
use of CTCs or ctDNA as early biomarkers of treatment response of metastatic breast cancer
seems to be more readily tangible52.
Emergence of resistant clones
Intratumour heterogeneity is a key factor that may lead to primary drug resistance because
the extent of genomic assessment and molecular characterization determines our ability to
identify potentially important subclones100. In patients who have clearly responded to
treatment but in whom disease subsequently progresses, a repeat tumour biopsy to detect the
expansion of pre-existent resistant subclones or the emergence of newly acquired resistant

clones may be highly informative. An important caveat is that clonal population size and
architecture cannot be assessed through biopsy sampling of a single metastatic site. If a
change in genotype is observed when another biopsy is taken at the onset of progression
after systemic treatment, this may be due to either clonal evolution or as a result of an earlier
false negative due to sampling bias. To circumvent such limitations of tumour biopsies,
characterization of CTC or ctDNA in plasma could be an attractive alternative if they are
demonstrated to be more reflective of the global molecular status. Furthermore, these
circulating ‘liquid tumours’ may also precede radiological evidence of tumour
growth42,43,54. These strategies to identify and tackle primary or acquired resistance can be
integrated into clinical trials using histology-based or histology-agnostic frameworks. For
instance, DETECT III (NCT01619111)101 is a multicentre, histology-based, randomized
phase III study that compares lapatinib (as a HER2-targeted therapy) combined with
standard therapy with standard therapy alone in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer
who have had HER2-positive CTCs detected in their blood. When the sample size is small,
an N-of-1 trial design may be used to sequentially assess, in the same patient, the effects of
different agents that may have antitumour activity against the resistant clones. It would seem
logical to interrogate an emerging resistant clone as early as possible, using the combination
or sequential therapeutic strategies previously described, although the timing for
pharmacological counteraction of clonal evolution may also require full assessment through
well-conceived clinical trials.

Future directions

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The occurrence of intratumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution in cancers, resulting in
malignant growth, invasion, metastasis and resistance acquisition has long been recognized.
The availability of molecular profiling technologies such as next-generation sequencing
coupled with advances in bioinformatics has enabled these previously elusive phenomena to
be assayed in the clinical setting. The challenges ahead are immense, and include the
reliable and accurate elucidation of geographical and temporal variations in patient samples
and the subsequent correlation with both prognosis and treatment response. Current efforts
are focused on gathering evidence to support the idea that intratumour heterogeneity
substantially affects disease outcome, although the relationship is probably context
dependent. Clinical trial strategies to interrogate intratumour heterogeneity are challenging,
and for researchers to gain a deeper understanding into these molecular complexities would
require not only the active participation of patients who are willing to undergo repeated
investigations, but also the collaborative engagement of clinicians and scientists. Without a
full understanding of the spectrum of a patient’s mutations, we may risk expending large
resources on the development of fundamentally flawed approaches to biomarker-directed
therapeutics.
The knowledge that significant intratumour heterogeneity is present in most patients has
important implications for predictive biomarker development in the context of early clinical
trials. First, quantitative biomarkers (for example, RNA expression) may be misleading, as
they are based on the average expression across a heterogeneous tumour. Second,
sequencing approaches may be misleading, unless careful attention is paid to detecting
minor clones of clinical significance. Last, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity that

results from events other than genomic alterations, for instance due to epigenetic alterations
or plasticity, is likely to have an important effect on treatment response (see Review by
Meacham and Morrison on page 328). Although we do not yet have the knowledge base to
successfully individualize treatment by accounting for both interpatient and intrapatient
heterogeneity, we believe that the delivery of comprehensive personalized cancer medicine
will eventually be possible.

Figure 1. Clinical-trial design frameworks

Author Manuscript

In a population of molecularly profiled patients who have tumours of different histologies
(shown by position of tumour) and molecular aberrations (shown as different colours), the
framework for a clinical trial can take a number of forms. a, Histology-based clinical trials
evaluate different molecular aberrations by enrolling patients with the same tumour
histology but who harbour different aberrations, and match groups of patients to different
drugs. b, Histology-independent, aberration-specific clinical trials, or ‘basket’ trials, enrol
patients with different tumour histologies but who harbour the same or related molecular
aberrations, and match drugs to the aberration specific or related groups. c, Standard N-of-1
trials randomly assign patients to different drugs in different sequential orders, with washout
periods between drugs to minimize crossover effects. At completion, the individual effect of
each drug and the average effects of each drug across individuals can be analysed. d,
Modified N-of-1 trials use each patient as his or her own control and compare the treatment
effect of the current matched drug with that of the most recent earlier drug.
