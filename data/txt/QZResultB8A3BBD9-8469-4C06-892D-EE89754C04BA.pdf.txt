ABSTRACT
An emerging characteristic of drug resistance in cancer is the induction of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the mechanisms of EMTmediated drug resistance remain poorly defined. Therefore, we conducted longterm treatments of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her2)-transformed
breast cancer cells with either the EGFR/Her2 kinase inhibitor, Lapatinib or TGF-β,
a known physiological inducer of EMT. Both of these treatment regimes resulted in
robust EMT phenotypes, but upon withdrawal a subpopulation of TGF-β induced cells
readily underwent mesenchymal-epithelial transition, where as Lapatinib-induced
cells failed to reestablish an epithelial population. The mesenchymal population
that remained following TGF-β stimulation and withdrawal was quickly selected for
during subsequent Lapatinib treatment, manifesting in inherent drug resistance.
The Nanostring cancer progression gene panel revealed a dramatic upregulation of
fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and its cognate ligand FGF2 in both
acquired and inherent resistance. Mechanistically, FGF:Erk1/2 signaling functions to
stabilize the EMT transcription factor Twist and thus maintain the mesenchymal and
drug resistant phenotype. Finally, Lapatinib resistant cells could be readily eliminated
using recently characterized covalent inhibitors of FGFR. Overall our data demonstrate
that next-generation targeting of FGFR can be used in combination with Her2-targeted
therapies to overcome resistance in this breast cancer subtype.

treatment with kinase inhibitors and that this transition
to a mesenchymal state facilitates tumor cell persistence
in the presence of these molecularly-targeted compounds
[7]. Despite these advances in elucidating the molecular
players involved in the conversion of cells from an
epithelial to mesenchymal state, little is known about the
changes in molecular signaling pathways that result as a
consequence of these differing EMT stimuli.
Human epidermal growth factor rector 2 (Her2) is
member of the ErbB family of growth factor receptors
and its expression is amplified in 20-25% of breast
cancer patients [8]. Treatment options of Her2+ breast
cancer patients has improved with the advent of targeted
antibodies (Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab) and kinase
inhibitors (Lapatinib, Afatinib, Neratinib), but inherent
and acquired resistance to these therapies remains a
major clinical problem for patients with this breast
cancer subtype [9, 10]. While the morphologic induction
of EMT is an underlying feature of resistance to these

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a
physiological process whereby epithelial cells breakdown
cell-cell junctions and transiently or permanently transition
into a state that is more representative of migratory cells
[1]. Transient EMT occurs during developmental events
(Type I) and during wound repair (Type II) [2]. In contrast,
initiation of “Type III” or pathological EMT contributes
to the invasion and ultimate metastasis of cancer cells [3,
4]. Physiologic and pathologic EMT can be induced by
cytokines such as TGF-β and HGF [5]. Mechanistically,
EMT is mediated through several signaling pathways that
act in concert to modulate expression of “master” EMT
transcription factors such as the basic helix loop helix
(bHLH) factor Twist. Twist leads to direct and indirect
downregulation of epithelial markers and upregulation
of mesenchymal markers [6]. More recent findings
demonstrate that EMT can also be directly initiated by

ErbB-targeting compounds a lack in understanding of the
molecular mechanisms of this event has prevented the
development of therapeutics capable of targeting this drug
resistant state [11, 12].
Previous studies by our lab and others have
demonstrated that expression of fibroblast growth factor
receptor 1 (FGFR1) is dramatically increased during TGFβ-induced EMT and plays a critical role in metastatic
tumor growth [13–15]. Along these lines, FGFR has
previously been suggested as a mechanism of resistance
to Her2 and other targeted molecular therapies [9, 16,
17]. Given these previous findings we sought to address
the hypothesis that FGFR functions as a driver of EMTassociated drug resistance. Our results clearly demonstrate
that following TGF-β-induced EMT Her2-transformed
cells maintain a resident mesenchymal cell population
that is highly resistant to ErbB inhibition. Conversely,
Lapatinib-resistant cells become increasingly sensitive
to our recently characterized covalent inhibitors of FGFR
[15, 18, 19]. Overall, our data suggest that combination
therapies utilizing both Her2 and FGFR inhibitors will
result in more durable clinical responses in patients with
this subtype of breast cancer.

ErbB inhibitor Afatinib lead to a similar mesenchymal
morphology but a proliferative population could not be
established (Supplementary Figure S1B). Both TGF-β
and Lapatinib-induced EMT events lead to the dramatic
upregulation of CD44. However, upon withdrawal of these
differential stimuli only those cells induced to undergo
EMT by TGF-β reestablished an epithelial population
where as a Lapatinib-induced EMT event was stably
maintained following withdrawal of the drug (Figure 1E
and 1F). The stable versus transient EMT events induced
by Lapatinib and TGF-β respectively could further be
visualized by immunoblot and immunofluorescence for
the mesenchymal marker vimentin and the epithelial
marker E-cadherin (Figure 1G, 1h and Supplementary
Figure S1C). Overall, these data clearly establish the
stable verses transient nature of EMT induced by
EGFR/Her2 inhibition versus that induced by TGF-β.
Furthermore, they demonstrate how TGF-β-induced EMT
and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) results
in the formation of a heterogeneous cell population
consisting of both epithelial and mesenchymal cells.

TGF-β-induced EMT primes cells to be
inherently drug resistance

RESULTS

Given the similarities between cell populations
that could be generated by TGF-β and Lapatinib induced
EMT we next sought to investigate the ability of TGF-βinduced EMT to generate drug resistant cells. Therefore,
we utilized cell viability assays to quantify the differential
response of parental Her2-transformed HMLE cells as
compared to cells that had been treated (4 weeks) and
removed (4 weeks) from either Lapatinib or TGF-β.
Indeed, consistent with their maintenance of a CD44high
mesenchymal phenotype Lapatinib selected cells remained
highly resistant even after prolonged culture in the absence
of drug (Figure 2A). Cell viability assays also established
that Lapatinib resistant cells are similarly more resistant
to covalent pan-ErbB inhibitor Afatinib (Supplementary
Figure S1D). Surprisingly, a post-TGF-β cell population
was also highly resistant to Lapatinib treatment even
though these cells had not previously been treated with
this compound (Figure 2A). Moreover, while a 4-week
treatment with 1 μM Lapatinib or Afatinib results in the
sparse persistence of very few parental cells those cells
that had been pretreated with TGF-β are stably resistant
and proliferative in the presence of these drug treatments
(Figure 2B). Flow cytometry for CD44 and CD24
demonstrated that treatment of the heterogeneous postTGF-β cell population leads to a robust selection for the
CD44high population (Figure 2C; middle column). This
treatment strategy had no affect on the Lapatinib resistant
cells (Figure 2C; right column). Overall, these data clearly
demonstrate that the CD44high mesenchymal population
that remains following TGF-β-induced EMT:MET possess
an inherent resistance to ErbB inhibition.

Acquisition of resistance to Lapatinib results in a
stable mesenchymal phenotype
Acquisition and/or inherent resistance to Her2
targeted therapies can take place through a number of
mechanisms that may be unique to the other underlying
mutations that are specific to particular tumor models
[20]. Therefore, in an effort to elucidate more global
mediators of resistance to the clinically used EGFR/Her2
kinase inhibitor, Lapatinib, we utilized a model in which
directed overexpression of Her2 mediates transformation
of otherwise normal mammary epithelial cells [21]. As
shown in Figure 1A Her2 was overexpressed in nontransformed human mammary epithelial cells (HMLE)
(Figure 1A). Ectopic expression of Her2 allowed for
culture of the HMLE cells in standard serum containing
media (not shown), reduced expression of CD24,
facilitated aberrant growth under 3D culture conditions
and led to tumor formation in mice (Figure 1B and 1C,
Supplementary Figure S1A, S1B and S1C). Importantly,
Her2-driven cell growth in 3D culture and tumor growth
in vivo could be significantly, but not completely,
inhibited by treatment with Lapatinib (Figure 1B and
1D). Long-term culture (4 weeks) of Her2-transformed
HMLE cells with regular addition of Lapatinib yielded
a proliferative cell population that displayed a highly
mesenchymal morphology (Figure 1E). A similar yet
distinct cell morphology could also be elicited in these
cells upon long-term culture with TGF-β1 (Figure 1E).

these post-TGF-β isolated subpopulations and found
that after three weeks of passage subsequent to FACS
isolation, only the CD44high population now contained
both epithelial and mesenchymal populations (Figure
3D; bottom row). Importantly, the CD44low population
that emerged following FACS isolation of CD44high cells
could be eliminated by treatment with Lapatinib (Figure
3D). Together with the data from Figure 2 these findings
indicate that following EMT and MET cells regain their
sensitivity to Lapatinib, but the resident population
of CD44high mesenchymal cells can manifest inherent
resistant to ErbB inhibition.

To further confirm our observations from Figures
1 and 2 we utilized fluorescence activated cell sorting
(FACS) to separate cells that had been treated and
withdrawn from TGF-β based on cell surface expression
levels of CD44 and CD24 (Figure 3A). Expression of
Her2 was equal between these isolated populations
as determined by western blot, but the CD44high/
mesenchymal population displayed enhanced basal
phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (Figure 3B). More importantly,
cell viability assays confirmed that only the CD44high
population was inherently resistant to Lapatinib (Figure
3C). Both CD44low populations displayed an IC50 to
Lapatinib that was similar to parental cells even though
these cell populations were derived from the same
TGF-β treated culture as the CD44high cells (Figure 3C).

to those cells displaying inherent Lapatinib resistance
generated via TGF-β stimulation. To do this we utilized
the Nanostring Pancancer, cancer progression gene
expression panel. This panel consists of 770 genes known
to be associated with angiogenesis, EMT, extracellular
matrix remodeling, and metastasis. Analysis of the
LapR cells and the post-TGF-β cells as compared to
their parental HMLE-Her2 counterparts revealed robust
upregulation of several extracellular matrix proteins,
integrins and EMT transcription factors (Figure 4A and
4B and Supplementary Table S1). Importantly, FGFR1
was the most upregulated growth factor receptor in postTGF-β and LapR cells and PCR analyses specified this
increase to be the –iiic isoform of FGFR1 and confirmed
increased expression of its cognate ligand FGF2 (Figure
4C and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). To further
confirm the ability of FGFR signaling to drive resistance
to ErbB inhibition we analyzed the CCLE database by
comparing the documented IC50 values for Lapatinib and
the corresponding expression levels of the FGFR1 in 27
analyzed breast cancer cell lines (Supplementary Figure
S3A). This comparison demonstrated a highly significant
positive correlation between FGFR1 expression and the
IC50 value for Lapatinib across these different cell lines

(Figure 5A). Furthermore, directed overexpression of
both the full length (α) or truncated (β) –iiic isoforms
of FGFR1 in the Lapatinib sensitive BT474 cells led
a highly significant resistance to Lapatinib (Figure 5B
and 5C, Supplementary Figure S3B). Finally, similar
overexpression of FGFR1 in our HMLE-Her2 cells
also supported significant resistance to Lapatinib and
Afatinib in a 3D organotypic culture (Figure 5D and 5E,
Supplementary Figure S3C). Importantly, in both of these
systems FGFR1-mediated resistance to ErbB inhibition
required the addition of exogenous FGF2 (Figure 5C and
5E). These data clearly demonstrate that FGF2:FGFR1
signaling is sufficient to facilitate resistance to ErbB
inhibition.

An FGFR:Erk1/2:Twist positive feedback loop
stabilizes a CD44high, drug resistant phenotype
Overexpression of the bHLH EMT transcription
factor Twist in the HMLE cells leads to a robust induction
of a CD44high mesenchymal phenotype [21]. Consistent
with our previous report using the normal murine
mammary gland cell model, we found that Twist driven
EMT includes a marked upregulation of FGFR1-β-iiic

in the HMLE cells (Supplementary Figure S2A, [15]).
MAPK phosphorylation is required to stabilize Twist
and prevent its proteosome-mediated degradation [22,
23]. Accordingly, we observed reversible loss of Twist
protein, but not mRNA expression in the murine model
using the direct Erk2 inhibitor VX11E (Supplementary
Figure S4). Additionally, treatment of the HMLE cells
with the MEK1/2 inhibitors Trametinib or AZD6244
resulted in a dose dependent loss of recombinant Twist
protein that mirrored inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation
(Supplementary Figure S5A-S5B). Moving upstream, we
observed this same loss in Twist protein, but not mRNA
could be elicited upon treatment with reversible and
covalent FGFR inhibitors (Figure 6A and 6B). Illustrating
the importance of covalent FGFR inhibition, Twist protein
levels returned 48 hours after addition of BGJ-398, but
remained diminished with the irreversible compounds
(Figure 6A, right panel). As a result of this loss in Twist
protein FGFR1 mRNA levels were significantly decreased
following FGFR and MEK inhibitor treatment while there
was no effect on FGFR2 mRNA (Figure 6B). As expected,
we found expression of Twist induced a CD44high/CD24low
phenotype as compared to control HMLE cells. However,
treatment with MEK/ERK inhibitors partially reversed

this phenotype as noted by decreasing expression of CD44
(Figure 6C). Similarly, covalent inhibition of FGFR also
decreased CD44 expression in the HMLE-Twist cells
(Figure 6D and Supplementary Figure S5C). Finally,
covalent inhibition of FGFR eliminated the CD44high postTGF-β population while sparing the CD44low cells (Figure
6D and Supplementary Figure S5D). Overall, these data
indicate that maintenance of a Lapatinib resistant CD44high
phenotype is dependent on FGFR-driven activation of
MEK/ERK signaling, leading to stabilization of Twist.

Combination of ErbB and FGFR therapy
eradicates CD44high and CD44low cell populations
Given the differential sensitivity of post-TGF-β
CD44low and CD44high cells to Lapatinib and FIIN4,
respectively we next sought to evaluate the sensitivity of
the LapR cells to covalent FGFR inhibition. HMLE-Her2
cells that spontaneously acquired resistance to Lapatinib
were significantly more sensitive to covalent FGFR
inhibition as compared to their parental counterparts
(Figure 7A). Similarly, the heterogeneous post-TGF-β cell
population was also significantly more sensitive to FIIN2
and FIIN4 as compared to the HMLE-Her2 parental cells

(Figure 7B and Supplementary Figure S6). Upon closer
examination of the post-TGF-β cultures we could readily
visualize the epithelial versus mesenchymal cell selection
that took place upon Lapatinib or FIIN4 treatment
respectively (Figure 7C). This cell type specific selection
could also be detected using flow cytometery for CD44/
CD24 (Figure 7D and 7E). Importantly, these studies again
demonstrated the inability of an ATP-competitive FGFR
inhibitor to eliminate the CD44high, Lapatinib resistant cells
(Figure 7D and 7E). Finally, cell viability assays clearly
demonstrate that combined treatment of Lapatinib with
either FIIN2 or FIIN4 eradicates cells capable of resisting
single agent treatment (Figure 7F).

population. These data demonstrate a merger in the ideas
between cellular plasticity and tumor heterogeneity,
two important concepts in EMT:MET biology. These
findings further suggest that the physiological processes
of EMT engender metastatic tumors with a resident
mesenchymal cell population that is inherently resistant to
currently used targeted therapies. Herein we utilized the
Her2-driven HMLE model to sequentially demonstrate
diminution of CD24 by directed Her2 overexpression and
increased CD44 expression following induction of EMT.
Subsequent to TGF-β-induced EMT:MET treatment with
Lapatinib or the more recently developed covalent panErbB inhibitor Afatinib results in immediate selection of
the CD44high mesenchymal cell population and inherent
drug resistance. These data are significant because prior to
TGF-β treatment we were unable to isolate a population
of cells that spontaneously acquired resistance to Afatinib.
Overall, these data are supported by clinical findings
showing a CD44high/CD24low phenotype is an independent
prognostic factor for decreased Her2+ patient survival
[24]. Furthermore, our data illustrate how tumors that have

DISCUSSION
Using an in vivo reporter for E-cadherin we recently
established that as breast cancer cells disseminate they
undergo a robust EMT followed by a partial MET during
metastatic outgrowth [14]. Our data herein using single
cell flow cytometric analyses suggest that this partial
MET actually results from the creation of a heterogeneous

undergone EMT:MET have a higher degree of cellular
heterogeneity and are therefore better poised to resist
single agent pharmacological insults.
An important aspect of the current study has been
the development of paired models of reversible (TGF-βinduced) and nonreversible (Lapatinib induced) EMT. Our
findings therefore establish a unique platform in which to
elucidate the factors that are required for mesenchymal
cells to maintain a state of plasticity and transition back
to an epithelial state. Ongoing studies in the lab are using
numerous methods to characterize the plasticity of the
post-TGF-β CD44high cell population as compared to the
stable mesenchymal phenotype that is generated upon
spontaneous acquisition of Lapatinib resistance. Further
understanding of the epigenetic factors involved in this
plasticity could lead to novel pharmacological approaches
to control epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity and thus
modulate response to particular therapeutics [25].
Importantly, our findings clearly point to the critical
role of FGFR in maintaining a mesenchymal and antiErbB resistance phenotype. Recent studies using the
SKBR3 model of Her2 breast cancer suggest that FGFR is
part of a more general kinome reprograming required for
Lapatinib resistance [11]. However, the role of FGFR may
have been underestimated in these studies due to the use of

Type I ATP competitive FGFR kinase inhibitors. Indeed,
the findings herein and our recently published studies
clearly point to the enhanced efficacy of covalent FGFR
inhibitors as compared to ATP competitive molecules
[15]. Furthermore, our utilization of both the HMLE and
BT474 models of Her2+ breast cancer clearly demonstrate
that enhanced FGFR1 expression when in the presence of
FGF ligand is sufficient to facilitate resistance to Lapatinib
treatment.
Our recent studies in normal murine mammary
gland cells establish that Twist is capable of inducing
FGFR1 expression, results that are completely consistent
with our data here using the HMLE model [15]. We further
expand upon this mechanism by demonstrating a positive
feedback loop in which FGFR signaling stabilizes Twist
protein levels to maintain a mesenchymal phenotype
(Figure 8). In addition to the regulation of the receptor
we also find that FGF2 ligand was upregulated in our
acquired and inherent Lapatinib resistant mesenchymal
populations. These data are supported by previous
findings that demonstrate an FGF2 signaling loop is
at play in basal-like breast cancer [26]. Furthermore,
together with our recent study we conclude that FGF2 and
β3 integrin are part of an EMT signature that contribute
to FGFR1-mediated drug resistance and metastatic

progression [15]. Along these lines, recent clinical data
indicate that unlike the autoactivation of Her2 upon gene
amplification, FGFR1 amplification alone is insufficient
to predict patient response to FGFR inhibitor therapy [27].
Mechanistically, we do not observe FGF stimulation alone
to induce EMT (data not shown), but instead our findings
suggest that FGFR acts to maintain Twist stability and
thus prolongs a mesenchymal phenotype following EMT
induction by alternate factors. Importantly, depletion of
Twist is sustained for up to 48 hours using covalent FGFR
inhibitors, but Twist quickly returns upon treatment with
the ATP competitive compound, BGJ-398. Pharmacologic
inhibition of FGFR, MEK and Erk support the notion that
FGFR-mediated stabilization of Twist is mediated through
an Erk-dependent mechanism (Figure 8). However, our
studies have not completely ruled out other signaling
mechanisms downstream of FGFR that may also be
contributing to maintenance of a mesenchymal cell
population. In any event, this sustained depletion of Twist

seems to be critical as covalent inhibition of FGFR was
required for successful elimination for Lapatinib-resistant
mesenchymal cells.
Overall, our data herein demonstrate that the
processes of EMT:MET plasticity enhance intra-tumor
heterogeneity to support drug resistance. Furthermore,
we demonstrate a mechanism whereby FGFR signaling
maintains a drug persistent mesenchymal cell state. These
studies indicate that combination of next generation ErbB
inhibitors with FIIN4 will serve as an effective therapeutic
strategy to prevent and/or reverse inherent or acquired
resistance to currently used ErbB-targeting strategies.
On going studies in the lab are taking a comprehensive
approach to optimize the in vivo pharmacology for this
combinatorial approach using a host of Her2-driven cell
lines and patient-derived xenograft model systems. These
studies have a high potential to translate into improved
clinical strategies for treating patients with this subtype
of breast cancer.

Figure 8: A Schematic representation of how FGFR signaling is bolstered following induction of EMT. The activity of
Erk1/2 stabilizes the expression of Twist, which drives the expression of FGFR1. In the continued presence of FGF ligand this constitutes
a positive feedback loop that supports a mesenchymal population of cells that are resistant to ErbB-targeted agents.

cytometry cells were fixed in 1% PFA, blocked in 1.0%
bovine serum albumin and stained with the indicated
antibodies that were directly conjugated to the fluorescent
probes. All antibodies and their respective applications and
concentrations are listed in Supplementary Table S3.

Cell culture and reagents
Human mammary epithelial cells (HMLE)
were obtained from Sendurai A. Mani (MD Anderson
Cancer Center, Houston TX) and NMuMG and BT474
cells were purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA,
USA). The HMLE cells were cultured in DMEM:F12
supplemented with insulin (10 μg/ml), EGF (10 ng/ml),
and hydrocortisone (250 μg/ml), this media was mixed
1:1 with Mammary Epithelial Cell Growth Medium
(MEGM) purchased from Lonza (Allendale, NJ, USA).
Bioluminescent HMLE cells were engineered to stably
express firefly luciferase via lentiviral transduction under
the selection of Blasticidin. Her2 and Twist expressing
HMLE cells and Twist expressing NMuMG cells were
constructed via stable transduction using pBabe viral
particles and selected for using puromycin. NMuMG,
Her2 transformed HMLE and BT474 cells were cultured
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% Pen/
Strep, and 10 μg/mL of insulin. Plasmids encoding
eGFP, FGFR1-α-IIIc (NM_023110.2) or FGFR1-β-IIIc
(NM_023105.2) were purchased from Cyagen Biosciences
(Santa Clara, CA, USA). These constructs were used to
construct lentiviral particles, and stable transduction was
selected for under Hygromycin selection. TGF-β1 and
basic FGF (FGF2) were purchased from R&D systems
(Minneapolis, MN). BGJ-398, Lapatinib, Afatinib,
Trametinib, VX11e, AZD-6244, and Idelalisib were
purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX), solubilized
in DMSO and used at the indicated concentrations. FIIN-2
and FIIN-4 were synthesized as previously described and
similarly solubilized in DMSO [15, 18].

Cell biological assays
Changes in cell viability were assayed using the
CellTiter-Glo assay from Promega (Madison, WI).
Where indicated bioluminescent HMLE-Her2 cells were
grown under 3D culture conditions and cell growth was
longitudinally tracked using a cell permeable luciferin
(GoldBio, St. Louis, MO). Briefly, 2000 cells were plated
in each well of a 96 well dish on top of a solidified 50 μl
bed of basement membrane extract (BME) from Trevigen
(Gaithersburg, MD). These cells were suspended in
growth media containing DMEM, 10% FBS and 5% of
the BME.

Statistical analyses
Statistical values were defined using an unpaired
Student’s T-test, where a P value < 0.05 was considered
significant. P values for all experiments are indicated.

mRNA analyses
An RNA isolation kit from Omega bio-tek
(Norcross, GA) was used to isolate RNA. These RNAs
were analyzed by NanoString Technologies (Seattle, WA)
using their PanCancer Progression Panel. In other assays
RNA was reverse-transcribed using a cDNA synthesis kit
from Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA). Where indicated
these cDNA libraries were assessed by standard PCR
and analyzed by gel electrophoresis or by real-time PCR
using iQ-SBYR green from BioRad (Hercules, CA). All
oligonucleotides used are listed in Supplementary Table
S2.
