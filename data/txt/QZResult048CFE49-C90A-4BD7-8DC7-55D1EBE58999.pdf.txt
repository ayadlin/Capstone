ABSTRACT
SET is known as a potent PP2A inhibitor, however, its oncogenic role including
its tumorigenic potential and involvement in the development of chemoresistance
in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not yet been fully discussed. In present
study, we investigated the oncogenic role of SET by SET-knockdown and showed
that SET silencing impaired cell growth rate, colony formation and tumor sphere
formation in A549 cells. Notably, silencing SET enhanced the pro-apoptotic effects
of paclitaxel, while ectopic expression of SET diminished the sensitivity of NSCLC
cells to paclitaxel. Since the SET protein was shown to affect chemosensitivity, we
next examined whether combining a novel SET antagonist, EMQA, sensitized NSCLC
cells to paclitaxel. Both the in vitro and in vivo experiments suggested that EMQA
and paclitaxel combination treatment was synergistic. Importantly, we found that
downregulating p-Akt by inhibiting SET-mediated protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
inactivation determined the pro-apoptotic effects of EMQA and paclitaxel combination
treatment. To dissect the critical site for EMQA functioning, we generated several
truncated SET proteins. By analysis of the effects of EMQA on the binding affinities
of different truncated SET proteins to PP2A-catalytic subunits, we revealed that the
227–277 amino-acid sequence is critical for EMQA-induced SET inhibition. Our findings
demonstrate the critical role of SET in NSCLC, particularly in the development of
chemoresistance. The synergistic effects of paclitaxel and the SET antagonist shown in
current study encourage further validation of the clinical potential of this combination.

INTRODUCTION

in both lung cancer cell lines and clinical tumor samples
obtained from patients with NSCLCs. Furthermore,
we observed that SET promotes cell growth and tumor
formation in NSCLC cells. Moreover, we found that
ectopic expression of SET induces resistance in NSCLC
cells to paclitaxel, and, importantly, antagonizing SET
via siRNA or a novel SET inhibitor, EMQA, significantly
enhances the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor effects of
paclitaxel.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents
nearly 85% of lung cancer patients and is the leading cause
of cancer-related death worldwide [1]. For the majority
of patients without particular actionable molecular
alterations, namely mutations of epidermal growth factor
receptor and fusion mutation involving the anaplastic
lymphoma kinase, and those who have progressed on
target agents, chemotherapy is the major treatment choice
[2–6]. However, the clinical benefit of chemotherapy is
largely limited by the occurrence of resistance. Nearly
25% of patients with advanced NSCLC show primary
resistance to first-line chemotherapy, and in almost every
case eventually leads to on chemotherapy progression
[7, 8]. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the possible
mechanisms associated with chemoresistance and find
effective strategies to improve the chemo-sensitivity of
patients.
The SET protein is a potent inhibitor of protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A) [9]. The expression of SET has
been found in tumor tissues of different human malignant
diseases, such as leukemia, Wilms’ tumor, aveolar
soft part sarcoma, cancer of colon, breast, and NSCLC
[10–16]. It is worth noting that the expression level of SET
is closely correlated with cell growth rate; in quiescent
or contact-inhibited cells, SET expression is low, but it
is significantly elevated in rapidly dividing cells  [10].
Importantly, SET promotes tumourigenesis through
interacting with several PP2A-regulated oncogenic
pathways, including Akt, MAPK, c-JUN, and BCR/ABL 
[17–22]. Moreover, Cristóbal et al. showed that SET
determined the sensitivity to oxaliplatin in colonrectal
cancer cells [15]. Overexpression of SET in three different
colon cancer cell lines, SW480, HT-29 and LS513,
resulted in increasing resistance to oxaliplatin and 5-FU,
and silencing SET via siRNA oppositely enhanced their
sensitivity to this chemoregimen. Collectively, these data
illustrate the putative role of SET in tumourigenesis and
drug resistance in human malignant diseases.
Intriguingly, there is a growing body of literature
demonstrating the anti-tumor effects of antagonizing
SET-mediated PP2A inhibition [11, 14, 16, 23–26].
FTY720, a sphingosine analogue, was found to reactivate
PP2A and promote apoptosis of cancer cells by disrupting
SET-PP2Ac binding in some malignant diseases, including
NSCLC [11, 15, 16, 27]. Furthermore, Bueno and his
colleagues demonstrated that treatment with FTY720 for
30-days impaired urethane-induced lung tumor growth in
BALB/c mice. [28] These findings suggest the therapeutic
potential of applying a SET antagonist for lung cancer
treatment. But the exact role of SET in tumourigenesis
and chemoresistance of lung cancer has yet not been full
characterized.
In the current report, we investigated the relevance
of SET in lung cancer and showed that SET was expressed

RESULTS
The SET oncoprotein affects cell growth and
sphere formation in NSCLC cells
To confirm the clinical relevance of SET protein
in NSLCL, we first analyzed the presence of SET in
the tumor tissue obtained from 53 patients with NSCLC
and the adjacent normal parts of lung in 43 patients
of this cohort (Table 1 and Figure 1A). Analyzed by
immunohistochemical (IHC) stain, 51 patients (96.2%)
had SET expression in their tumors. Importantly, the
strength of SET expression in tumors was significantly
higher than that in the normal tissues; the average H
score was 181 in tumor parts and 73.7 in normal parts
(Figure 1A). More importantly, we found that high SET
expression in tumor part was significantly associated
with poor tumor differentiation (p = 0.030) and advanced
clinical stage of patient (p = 0.031, Table 2). To disclose
the role of SET in promoting carcinogenesis of NSCLC
cells, shRNA against SET was used to knockdown SET in
A549 cells. The growth rates and tumourigenecity abilities
of these wild-type (WT) and SET-knockdown (SET-KD)
A549 cells were assessed by MTT, colony formation
and sphere formation assay. As shown in Figure 1B and
1C, genetic knockdown of SET significantly affected the
growth rates of A549 cells. The cell growth rate of SETKD A549 cells determined by MTT was significantly
slower than WT cells, and the number of tumor colonies
formed at 14 days was significantly reduced in the SETKD cells, too. The ability of tumor sphere formation was
also significantly diminished in these SET-KD cells.
(Figure 1D)

The presence of SET inhibits the activity of
PP2A of NSCLC cell and impairs its sensitivity
to chemotherapy
To understand the biological effects of SET in
NSCLC, we first examined the endogenous expression
of SET in three different NSCLC cell lines, namely
H358, H460 and A549 cells. As shown in Figure 2A
and 2B, the three NSCLC cell lines expressed SET
similarly in both protein and mRNA level. Furthermore,
transient knockdown of SET leaded to increasing PP2A
activity and downregulation of p-Akt, one of the major

PP2A-regulated oncogenic signals, in all NSCLC cells
(Figure 2C). Since chemotherapy is one of the major
treatments for NSCLC patients in a setting of almost
certain eventual chemoresistance, we next investigated
whether SET overexpression affects the sensitivity of lung
cancer cells to chemotherapy. Interestingly, we found that
the pro-apoptotic effects of paclitaxel were significantly
diminished in cancer cells with SET overexpression
(Figure 2D). Collectively, above data obtained from
NSCLC cell lines and the clinicopathologic analysis of
NSCLC patients suggested that SET plays a critical role in
promoting carcinogenesis and chemoresistance of NSCLC.

properties via targeting SET-PP2A binding [29]. We used
three different methods to evaluate the anti-NSCLC effects
of EMQA and FTY720. As shown in Figure 3A, both
EMQA and FTY720 impaired the viabilities of all NSCLC
cells in a dose-dependent manner, but the doses required
for EMQA to achieve more than 50% inhibition on cell
survival were much lower than FTY720. By Annexin V/
PI double staining, we further characterized the proportion
of cells underwent apoptotic and necroptotic cell death
induced by EMQA and FTY720. As shown in Figure 3B,
both apoptotic and necroptotic cell death contributed to
the anti-NSCLC effects of EMQA and FTY720. Taken
apoptotic and necroptotic death into account, the number
of EMQA-induced cell death was nearly two times more
than that of FTY720. Furthermore, we examined the
PP2A activities of NSCLC cells after exposing to EMQA
and FTY720, and found that the incremental changes of
PP2A activities induced by EMQA was also higher than
that of FTY720 (Figure 3C). Importantly, western blot
analysis showed corresponding changes; EMQA-mediated
downregulation of p-Akt and induction of PARP signaling
were more potent than that of FTY720 at the same dose
level (Figure 3D). Taken together, EMQA exerts better
anti-NSCLC properties than FTY720 through improving
PP2A-mediating p-Akt downregulation.

Antagonizing SET-mediated PP2A inactivation is
a feasible approach against NSCLC
Given the vital role of SET suggested by above
data, we’re interested to know whether SET could serve
as a good target for the development of future anti-cancer
treatment. In the past few years, our team focused on
investigating potential PP2A enhancer as anti-cancer
treatment. A novel small molecule compound, EMQA
(previously named TD19), was recently identified to inhibit
SET-mediated PP2A inactivation. In addition, FTY720, a
sphingosine analogue was reported to exert anti-tumor

SET antagonist work synergistically with
paclitaxel in NSCLC cells via promoting
PP2A-mediated p-Akt downregulation

of p-Akt, but also diminished the pro-apoptotic effects of
EMQA-paclitaxel co-treatment in A549 and H460 cells.
Correspondingly, when we used siRNA to knockdown
PP2Ac specifically, the effects of EMQA and paclitaxel
co-treatment were significantly reversed (Figure  6D).
Taken together, our findings indicate that EMQA and
paclitaxel co-treatment downregulates p-Akt by enhancing
the activity of PP2A in NSCLC cells.

Since SET was shown to promote resistance to
paclitaxel in our previous data, we aimed understand
whether targeting SET would be a potential approach to
reverse chemoresistance of NSCLC cells. As shown in
Figure 4A and 4B, exposing to paclitaxel inhibited the
viabilities of A549 cells, while additive SET inhibition
further enhanced the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel.
Next, we assessed the therapeutic effects on combining
SET antagonist to paclitaxel. Compared with paclitaxel
single treatment, the numbers of apoptotic cells were
significantly increased in lung cancer cells co-treated
with EMQA and paclitaxel (Figure 4C). The combination
index of the three NSCLC cell lines tested was below
one, which indicated a synergism between the SET
antagonist and paclitaxel treatment (Figure 4D). To
further illustrate the molecular events that occurred upon
co-treatment, we analyzed the cell lysate treated with
paclitaxel 10 nM and/or EMQA 5 μM by western blot.
Corresponding to prior data, we found that the expression
of p-Akt was significantly decreased in all lung cancer
cell lines treated with EMQA and paclitaxel (Figure 4E).
Furthermore, co-treatment-induced downregulation of
p-Akt was shown in a dose- and time-dependent manner
(Figure 5A and 5B). Importantly, the activation of PARP
signaling corresponded to downregulation of p-Akt. To
further validate the role of Akt, we generated A549 and
H460 cells with ectopic expression of myc-tagged Akt
by transient transfection and treated them with EMQA
5 μM and paclitaxel 10 nM. As shown in Figure 5C, the
efficacies of co-treatment was significantly reduced in the
Akt-overexpressed cells. Together, our findings indicate
that inhibition of Akt signaling determines the synergistic
effects of EMQA and paclitaxel in NSCLC cells.

EMQA reactivates PP2A by disrupting
SET-mediated PP2A inactivation
EMQA was found to enhance PP2A activity via
targeting SET. To validate the mechanism of action,
we used three different strategies to elucidate how
EMQA affects SET-PP2Ac binding. As shown in
Figure 7A and 7B, the expressions of PP2Ac in the
SET-immunoprecipitant complex were decreased
by EMQA treatment in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. Correspondingly, increasing dose of EMQA
also led to decreasing expression of SET in the PP2Ac
immunoprecipitant complex (Figure 7A, right panel).
Furthermore, we used proximal ligation assay (PLA) to
demonstrate the effects of EMQA-paclitaxel co-treatment
in individual cells. As shown in Figure 7C, high PLA
signals were presented in the untreated A549 cells and
significantly diminished in the cells exposed to EMQA
and paclitaxel. Next, we overexpressed SET in A549 and
H460 cells and treated them with EMQA and paclitaxel.
As illustrated in Figure 7D, the effects of EMQA
and paclitaxel co-treatment on promoting apoptosis
and inhibiting p-Akt expression were diminished by
overexpressing SET. These data validate the role of
SET in mediating the effects of EMQA and paclitaxel
co-treatment. To elaborate the target sites of EMQA, we
generated four truncated forms of SET proteins (SET1–127,
SET1–177, SET1–227, and SET76–277 , Figure 7F). First, we
tested the effects of EMQA on the binding affinities
between PP2Ac and these truncated SET proteins
(Figure 7E). Using a cell-free surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) system, we exposed different proportions of fulllength and truncated SET to a fixed-dose of EMQA and
PP2Ac protein. Interestingly, we found that the effects of
EMQA on affecting the binding affinities between fulllength SET to PP2Ac and SET76–277 to PP2Ac were similar
(Figure 7E). Conversely, with increasing proportion
of SET1–127, SET1–177 and SET1–227 in the SET protein
complex, the signals bound to PP2Ac were significantly
increased. The data indicated that only the truncated SET
containing its C-terminal fragment (SET76–277) was targeted
by EMQA. To validate the SPR findings, we generated
A549 cells with ectopic overexpression of DDK-tagged
truncated SET protein by transient transfection. As shown
in Figure 7F, only the binding of PP2Ac with full-length
SET and SET76–277 were disrupted by EMQA.

Validation of the role of SET-PP2A in the
anti-NSCLC mechanism of EMQA and
paclitaxel co-treatment
Since EMQA targets SET, the PP2A inhibitor, and
PP2A is an important negative regulator of p-Akt, we next
sough to examine whether and how PP2A was affected
by co-treatment of EMQA and paclitaxel. NSCLC cells
were treated with EMQA 5 μM and/or paclitaxel 10 nM,
and analyzed by western blot and PP2A activity assay.
Notably, the PP2A activities in cells treated with EMQA
and EMQA plus paclitaxel were significantly increased
than control (Figure 6A), without affecting the expressions
of PP2A subunits (Figure 6B). Next, we exposed A549
and H460 cells to okadaic acid (OA), a PP2A inhibitor,
and/or EMQA-paclitaxel co-treatment. As shown in
Figure 6C, OA treatment not only enhanced the expression

we found that the expression of SET was significantly
correlated with the expression of p-Akt (p = 0.031).
Furthermore, we found that patients with concomitant
overexpression of SET and p-Akt had significantly
shorter progression-free-survival after initial diagnosis
(Figure 8G). Lastly, we tested the effects of EMQA on
the primary lung cancer cells obtained from two different
patients with NSCLC (Figure 8H). Using MTT assay, we
found that EMQA inhibited the viability of both cells with
an IC50 below 2.5 μM.

and contributing to the occurrence of chemoresistance
in NSCLC cells. However, current data is not sufficient
to fully illustrate the role of SET in mediating secondary
chemoresistance. We tried to validate the potential role
regarding this property by examining SET expression
after exposing NSCLC cells to paclitaxel, but found no
significant changes in the mRNA or protein expression of
SET (supplementary Figure 2). Further studies are needed
to address this issue.
PP2A is a major serine/threonine phosphatase
that regulates various cellular processes, such as signal
transduction, cell cycle determination, apoptosis, protein
synthesis, metabolism and stress response [29, 35, 36].
As OA, a PP2A inhibitor, promotes tumor growth,
and inactivation of PP2A is required for the cellular
malignant transformation induced by SV40 and RalA,
the tumor suppressor role of PP2A is strongly suggested.
[15, 35, 37, 38] Importantly, aberrant expression of the
PP2A inhibitors, such as SET and cancerous inhibitor
of PP2A (CIP2A), in tumor cells are the major causes
of PP2A dysfunction in human cancers. [12, 25, 39]
For NSCLC, the oncogenic role of SET has less been
discussed till recently. The study published by Liu et al.
was the first to show that 91.4% of NSCLC tumors were
positive for SET expression, and high SET expression
was associated with advanced clinical stage and worse
survival of patients [16]. The authors also found that
SET knockdown impaired the proliferative and invasive
potential of NSCLC cells through enhancing PP2Amediated inhibition of oncogenic signals, including AKT.
In this report, we validated the high prevalence and tumorspecificity of SET expression in NSCLC (Figure  1A),
and demonstrated the closely correlated expressions of
SET and p-Akt (Figure 8F). Furthermore, we found that
co-high expression of SET and p-Akt defined a specific
subgroup of patients with rapid progression potential
(Figure 8G). Taken together, the results of Liu’s and our
study demonstrated the importance of SET/PP2A/p-Akt
signal in NSCLC patients, and justified the rationale of
targeting SET for the treatment of NSCLC.
By far, FTY720 and OP449 were the most
frequently studied SET antagonists. [11, 14, 15, 29]
FTY720 was originally designed and developed as an
immunosuppressant to treat patients with relapsing
multiple sclerosis [40]. Interestingly, subsequent studies
showed that FTY720 exerts an “off-target” effect
activating PP2A by dissociating SET-PP2Ac interactions.
[11, 25, 29] On the other hand, the apolipoprotein-E
mimetic peptide, OP449 (previously named COG112),
was specifically designed to bind to the SET protein
and antagonizes the SET-mediated PP2A inactivation.
[24, 26] These two compounds have been tested in several
different types of cancers with promising results [11, 24–
26, 29]. In this study, we introduced the efficacy and detail
mechanism of action of a novel compound, EMQA, and
compared it with FTY720 for the treatment of NSCLC.

DISCUSSION
In the current report, we described the clinical
relevance of SET expression in NSCLC patients and
characterized the tumor promoting properties of SET in
NSCLC cells. Furthermore, we found that SET-mediated
PP2A inactivation may be responsible for the occurrence
of chemoresistance in NSCLC cells, and additive
knockdown of SET restored the sensitivity of NSCLC
cells to paclitaxel. Moreover, we showed the anti-NSCLC
efficacies of SET antagonist alone or in combination with
paclitaxel in vitro, in vivo and on primary NSCLC cells.
Our findings increase knowledge about the oncogenic
role of SET in NSCLC, and also suggest a novel strategy
through which to sensitize NSCLC to chemotherapy.
Many different mechanisms have been proposed
to explain the occurrence of chemoresistance in cancer
cells, such as the appearance of multidrug resistance
transporters resulting in decreased intra-tumor drug
concentrations, reduced drug activation by increased
detoxificantion of drugs, and alterations in the drug
target or apoptosis regulatory genes [30–33]. However,
the above-mentioned mechanisms largely focused
on the “treatment-induced” resistance and might not
address other potential mechanisms of chemoresistance,
particularly the cause of primary resistance. In this study,
we found that SET was upregulated in the tumors obtained
from NSCLC patients upon diagnosis (Figure 1A). Ectopic
expression of SET diminished the anti-tumor properties
of paclitaxel (Figure 2D). Transient knockdown of
SET alone didn’t lead to activation of apoptosis signal
(supplementary Figure 1) but silencing SET by shRNA led
to promotion of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of NSCLC
cells (Figure 4A and 4B). Furthermore, we showed that
the synergistic anti-cancer effects by combining a novel
SET antagonist, EMQA, and paclitaxel, and the synergism
of this combination was determined by inhibition SET/
PP2A/p-Akt signaling (Figures 5–7). Intriguingly,
upreguation of Akt signaling was reported to contribute
to the chemoresistance to cisplatin and docetaxel in
lung cancer cell lines, and use of LY294002, a PI3K/
Akt inhibitor, showed synergy with docetaxel. [33, 34]
From our current observations and previous findings,
we concluded that SET-induced PP2A inactivation may
play a critical role mediating the upregulation of p-Akt

Interestingly, we showed that EMQA and FTY720 both
were active compounds against NSCLC, while EMQA
exert more potent anti-tumor properties (Figure 3). As we
detailed in material section, this compound was originally
developed to enhance PP2A via targeting another PP2A
inhibitor, CIP2A [41], but whether the additive CIP2A
suppression contributed to better anti-tumor effects of
EMQA was not clear. More studies are needed to clarify
this observation. Collectively, our findings and previous
reports suggest that reactivating PP2A by targeting SET
may be a feasible and highly potential direction to develop
novel treatment against NSCLC and other malignant
disease [12, 24, 25, 39, 42].
In order to detail the mechanisms by which the small
molecular compound, EMQA, affects the binding between
SET and PP2Ac, we generated four different truncated
SET proteins and tested them using SPR (Figure 7E) and
co-immunoprecipitation (Figure 7F). Distinct from the
full-length and the truncated SET76–277 proteins, we found
EMQA could not affect the binding between the PP2Ac
and truncated SET proteins without the C-terminal. Our
data indicated that the Asp/Glu-rich C-terminus of SET
protein is required for the EMQA drug effects. [43]
Notably, both OP449 and FTY720 were found to target the
last 100 amino acid in the C-terminus, almost identical to
EMQA. [18, 23, 24] These findings support our previous
notions that the Asp/Glu-rich acidic region serves as the
protein domains involved in protein-protein interaction
and transcriptional activation [44–46].

EMQA to reactivate PP2A was through inhibition of
CIP2A and the property as SET antagonist was identified
and reported here. For in vitro studies, drugs were dissolved
in dimethyl sufoxide (DMSO) at various concentrations
and added to cells in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5%
fetal bovine serum (FBS). The final DMSO concentration
was 0.1% after adding to the medium. Antibodies for
immunoblotting including anti-PP2Ac, -Akt, and -PARP
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San
Diego, CA), anti-DDK-Tag was obtained from Origene
(Rockville, MD) and anti-SET was obtained from Bethyl
(Montgomery, TX). Other antibodies including antip-Akt and -Myc-tag were purchased from Cell Signal
(Danvers, MA).

Cell culture and western blot analysis
The A549, H460 and H358 cell lines were obtained
from the Bioresource Collection and Research Center
(BCRC; Hsinchu, Taiwan). Cells were maintained in
RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS in a 37°C humidiﬁed
incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. After
exposure to treatments at the indicated concentrations
and time periods, cell lysates were prepared for
immunoblotting and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP).
The procedure of co-IP and western blot analysis were
performed as previously described [47].

Cell viability and apoptosis analysis
The viabilities of NSCLC cells with and without
SET knockdown were determined by MTT assay.
The numbers of apoptotic cells were determined by
flow cytometry (sub-G1) and western blot analylsis of
PARP. Annexin-V/PI double staining assay was used to
determine the numbers of both apoptosis and necrotic
cells. Synergism of paclitaxel and EMQA were determined
by the software package CalcuSyn (Biosoft, Cambridge,
UK) and a combination index less than 1 was defined as
synergism.

CONCLUSION
In this study, we characterized the role of the
oncoprotein SET in NSCLC. We found that SET
protein is critically involved in the carcinogenesis and
the development of chemoresistance of NSCLC. More
importantly, we showed that a novel SET antagonist,
EMQA, reactivates PP2A and sensitizes NSCLC cells to
paclitaxel treatment in vitro and in vivo. Our results not
only illustrate a potential mechanism of chemoresistance,
but also provide evidence to support further development
of SET antagonists for the treatment of NSCLC.

Colony formation and sphere formation assay
For colony formation assay, A549 cells with and
without SET knockdown were seeded in 10 cm plates at
a density of 1000 cells per well and culture for 14 days.
Colonies were fixed with 3.75% of paraformaldehyde
solution, stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and analyzed by
inverted microscope. For the generation of tumor spheres,
10,000 cells were plated in 6-well ultra-low attachment
plates (Corning) and grown in serum-free medium. After
7 days, plates were analyzed for sphere formation.

(L-003598–01) were purchased from Dharmacon (GE;
Lafayette, CO). The SET short hairpin RNA (shSET)
were obtained from National RNAI Core Facility Platform
(Taiwan). In brief, cells were ﬁrst transfected with siRNA
(ﬁnal concentration, 100  nM) using the Dharma-FECT4
transfection reagent (Dharmacon) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions for 48 hours. The efficacy of
genetic knockdown was confirmed by western blot.

A549 cells were seeded on glass cover slides
overnight and subsequently exposed to co-treatment
of EMQA and paclitaxel or DMSO for 24 hours. The
in vivo binding of SET and PP2Ac was assessed using
the Duolink II Detection Kit (Sigma). The primary probe
antibodies were monoclonal mouse anti-PP2A and rabbit
anti-SET antibodies.

Transient transfection
Expression of recombinant protein
The cDNAs of SET and Akt were obtained from
Origene (Rockville, MD, USA), and cDNAs of truncated
SET (1–77, 1–127, 1–227 and 76–277) were generated
in our lab. Following transfection for 48 hours, cells
were exposed to EMQA for 24 hours and subsequently
harvested for further analysis.

The plasmid-containing human full-length SET
was obtained from OriGene (RC207606, Rockville, MD).
The cDNA of full-length and four truncated forms of SET
(1–127, 1–177, 1–227 and 76–277) were subcloned into
the BamH I and Not I sites of the pCMV6-Entry vector.
The FLAG fusion protein of FL and truncated mutations
of SET were expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity
purified using HisTALON gravity columns (Takara
Clontech). PP2Ac-GST was purchased from Abnova
(H00005515, Abnova, Taiwan) and SET-His recombinant
proteins used for SPR were obtained from Genway (GWBATG319, GenWay, San Diego).

PP2A phosphatase activity
The protein phosphatase activity in each cell
lysate was determined by measuring the generation of
free phosphate from threonine phosphopeptide using the
malachite green–phosphate complex assay as described
by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake
Placid, NY, USA). In brief, PP2A-speciﬁc reaction
butter (Milipore, Billerica, MA, USA) containing
750 mM phosphopeptide substrate was added into cell
lysates prepared in a low-detergent lysis buffer. After
incubation for 10 min at 30°C, the malachite dye was
added and free phosphate was measured by optical
density at 650 nm.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
Binding affinities of full-length SET and truncated
SET to PP2Ac and the effect of EMQA on disrupting SET
and PP2Ac were analyzed on a BIAcore T200 biosensor
system (GE). In brief, PP2Ac-GST recombinant protein
was bound in the CM5 chip pre-coated with GST-capture
antibodies. Sensorgrams were generated by injecting
several concentrations of EMQA mixed with fixedconcentration of SET recombinant protein, or the mixture
of different concentration of truncated SET proteins in
a fixed-dose EMQA. PP2Ac-GST recombinant protein
used for this experiment was purchased from Abnova
(H00005515) and SET-His recombinant protein was
obtained from Genway (GWB-ATG319).

Quantification of SET gene expression
The endogenous SET mRNA expression of
NSCLC cells were assessed by qPCR. According to the
manufacturer’s instructions, total RNA from the cell was
extracted from indicated cell lines using PureLink RNA
mini kit (ThermoFisher) and than reversely transcribed
using a SuperScript VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen).
The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was performed on a 7500 Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystem) with a specific primer set of target
gene and SYBR Green dye for detection. GAPDH was
used as the reference gene and experiments were repeated
in triplicate. The relative level of gene expression of
indicated cell lines to A549 was calculated by the 2-ΔΔCt
method.
Gene-specific primer pairs used in this experiment are:

using these mice were performed in accordance with
protocols approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal
Care and Use Committee of National Taiwan University.
Each mouse was inoculated s.c. in the dorsal ﬂank with
1 × 106 A549 cells suspended in 0.1 ml of serum-free
medium containing 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences,
Bedford, MA). Mice with successful inoculation of A549

the clinical part, descriptive statistical analysis was used to
compare baseline characteristics among patients with high
and low SET expressions. Progression-free survival (PFS)
was defined by the time of initial diagnosis of NSCLC to
the date confirmed local recurrence or distant metastasis.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the PFS,
and log-rank test was used for comparisons. Differences
were considered significant at P value less than 0.05. All
statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software
for Windows (17.0 version, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

Patient samples, primary culture and
immunohistochemical staining
This part of the study was approved by the ethics
committee of the Institutional Review Board of Cardinal
Tien Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan. All informed
consents from sample donors were in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and were obtained at the time of
donation.
Primary tumor tissues and cell were obtained
from NSCLC patients. Patient’s important clinical
characteristics were collected by chart review. For
IHC study, representative tissues of the lung tumor and
adjacent normal tissues (if available) were carefully
collected from each patient and made into a tissue array.
These paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections (4  μm)
on poly-L-lysine-coated slides were deparaffinized and
rinsed with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mM sodium
chloride before performing IHC studies. Peroxidase was
quenched with methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide.
Slides were then placed in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0)
at 100°C for 20 minutes in a pressurized heating chamber.
After incubation with 1:500 dilution of SET antibody
(A302–2621, Bethyl, Taxas) and 1:200 dilution of p-AKT
antibody (SC-16646-R, Santa Cruz, San Diego, CA)
for 1 hour at room temperature, slides were thoroughly
washed three times with phosphate buffered saline. Bound
antibodies were detected using the EnVision Detection
Systems Peroxidase/DAB, Rabbit/Mouse kit (Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark). The slides were then counterstained
with hematoxylin. Each experiment included, for each
tissue array slide, phosphate-buffered solution used as
the primary antibody for the negative controls, whereas
samples known to express SET or p-Akt strongly served
as the positive control. Every slides was reviewed by a
specific pathologist, and both the strength of staining
and the percentage of positive cells were used for the
calculation of H score. Tumor with high SET expression
was defined as those with H score more than 190, while
the H score for high p-Akt was 170 or more. For primary
cell culture, fresh collected body fluid were carefully
centrifuged, washed and treated with red blood cell
lysis buffer for about 10 minutes. Harvested cells were
subsequently cultured and maintained in RPMI culture
median.
