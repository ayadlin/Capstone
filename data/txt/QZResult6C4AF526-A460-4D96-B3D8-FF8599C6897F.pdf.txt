The Role of High-Dose Imatinib in the
Management of Patients With
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor
Alessandro Gronchi, MD1; Jean-Yves Blay, MD, PhD2,3,4; and Jonathan C. Trent, MD, PhD5

After an era of few treatment options for patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor
(GIST), imatinib has emerged as the standard of care and first-line treatment for these patients. Although imatinib
was initially approved at the doses of 400 and 600 mg daily, results from clinical studies established 400 mg daily
as the standard initial dose for the majority of advanced GIST patients. Nevertheless, the use of high-dose imatinib
(800 mg daily) has been shown to benefit patients with advanced or metastatic GIST that progresses on the standard-dose, and has been recommended in this setting by the major management guidelines in Europe and the United
States. Results from the Meta-GIST meta-analysis showed that patients whose GIST harbors a KIT exon 9 mutation
garner a longer progression-free survival time when treated initially with high-dose imatinib (800 mg daily) compared with those patients with KIT exon 11 or no mutations. Thus, the use of high-dose imatinib is recommended by
the clinical practice guidelines in these 2 specific clinical situations. In addition, clinicians should weigh the clinical
benefit of administering high-dose imatinib against the associated toxicities, as well as the proper management of

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare tumors diagnosed in a small percentage of the population (1020 cases per million).1,2 Nonetheless, GISTs are the most common sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract, accounting for at
least 5% of all sarcomas and 82% of all gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors.3,4 GISTs may arise anywhere throughout
the gastrointestinal tract, including the lower part of the esophagus and the anorectal region. However, GISTs most commonly occur in the stomach (60%), followed by the small intestine (30%), duodenum (4%-5%), rectum (4%), esophagus
(<1%) and colon (1%-2%).5
GISTs are most often characterized by strong immunoreactivity to the CD117 antigen, that is, the KIT protein.
This strong KIT expression is observed on the interstitial cells of Cajal—pacemaker cells that express high levels of KIT
and from which GISTs are thought to derive.6,7 Besides KIT, 70% to 75% of GISTs stain positive for CD34, 25% to
56% stain for smooth muscle actin, 32% express S100 protein, and 1% to <5% are desmin positive.8,9
A landmark study by Hirota et al and subsequent reports found that KIT was mutated in approximately 80% of
GISTs.10,11 These KIT mutations cause ligand-independent KIT phosphorylation of the mutated protein and constitutive
activation of the pathway, leading to cell proliferation and malignant transformation.10 However, KIT mutational status
is independent of KIT immunoexpression, as 1) high levels of KIT are a constitutional feature and not a direct consequence of KIT mutation-related autoactivation,9 and 2) mutant activated KIT proteins are retained within intracellular
endoplasmic compartments.12 KIT mutations have been detected principally (66% to 71%) in gene portions encoding for
the juxtamembrane region, most often exon 11, followed by the fifth extracellular immunoglobulin-like region encoded
by exon 9 (13%), and less frequently in the tyrosine kinase domain 1 encoded by exon 13 (1% to 4%) and the phosphotransferase domain encoded by exon 17 (>1% to 4%).10,11,13 In addition, activating mutations in PDGFRA have been
identified in 5% to 7% of GISTs.14,15 KIT and PDGFRA mutations appear to be mutually exclusive in GISTs.16,17 Most

Risk Assessment: Predicting Malignant
Behavior of GISTs
Determining the risk of recurrence of localized GISTs after complete resection is an important facet of disease
management and can provide vital information on the
treatment regimen to follow. The most widely accepted
criteria for risk stratification include tumor size, mitotic
rate, tumor location, and kinase mutational status.
Size

Small incidental GISTs of <1 cm are most often
considered at very low risk of recurrence, whereas large
tumors (5 to >10 cm) correlate with recurrence after surgical resection.18,19 Fletcher et al stratified patients from
low to high risk according to tumor size and mitotic
count, where risk of progression increases with size.20
According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the European Society of Medical Oncology guidelines, GISTs of 2 cm should be resected,
whereas the management of those <2 cm remains controversial, and excision is reserved only for those that increase
in size, and for primary tumors of the rectum.15,21
Mitotic index

The mitotic index of tumors designates the number
of mitoses per 50 high-power fields (HPFs), a microscopic

1848

measurement equal to approximately 5 mm2. Tumors
with a mitotic count of 0 to 5 per 50 HPFs will not or will
very rarely metastasize (unless they are large or arise from
small bowel or rectum), whereas a mitotic count of >5
per 50 HPFs is recognized as an indicator of high risk of
malignancy, and tumors with >20 to 50 mitoses per 50
HPFs are generally regarded as very high risk for subsequent development of metastases.22
Tumor site

Various reports suggest that tumor location can predict disease progression independently of tumor size and
mitotic index. Despite earlier reports, esophageal GISTs
have been shown to have a poor prognosis.5,23,24 Conversely, gastric GISTs have a better outcome than GISTs
arising from other locations.5,25 Miettinen and Lasota
reported a meticulous risk prognosis analysis based on
long-term follow-up studies of 1800 patients, correlating
tumor site with tumor size, and mitotic count (Table 1).
Overall, they showed that small intestinal GISTs exhibit a
greater propensity for malignant behavior than gastric
GISTs with similar size and mitotic count. Small intestinal GISTs have a mortality rate of 40% to 50% and gastric GISTs of 20% to 25%.5
Kinase mutational status

Patients with KIT mutations have a higher risk of
relapse than those without mutations. Within mutant
GISTs, those patients with KIT exon 11 mutations were
found to have a shorter relapse-free survival than those
without KIT mutations in most but not all reports.26 In

particular, KIT exon 11 deletions and homozygous mutations correlated with poor prognosis in the prekinase inhibitor era.27,28 Conversely, patients whose tumor had
PDGFRA exon 18 mutations were shown to correlate
with gastric location and a more favorable outcome after
resection of the primary tumor in the absence of
metastasis.29,30
The Advent of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor
Therapy in GIST: The Paradigm of Targeted
Oncogene Treatment in Solid Tumors
The discovery of imatinib as a potent inhibitor of KIT in
the preclinical setting opened the door for its use in
patients with GIST.31 An early case study reported a
patient with metastatic GISTs who achieved a complete
metabolic response after only 1 month of imatinib therapy; the responses continued for >11 months with minimal toxicity.32 Subsequently, a European Organization
for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) phase 1
study evaluated escalating imatinib doses from 400 to
1000 mg daily, all of which resulted in responses. However, imatinib 1000 mg daily was related to grade 3 toxic
effects, so it was determined that imatinib 800 mg daily
was the maximum tolerated dose.33
Concurrently, the B2222 phase 2 trial of 147
patients with unresectable or metastatic GISTs showed
clinical responses with imatinib at either 400 or 600 mg
daily.34 On the basis of a 9-month follow-up, 80% and
82% of patients had partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) with 400 and 600 mg daily, respectively.
Although this study was not powered to distinguish efficacy between the 2 doses of imatinib, of 9 patients who
crossed over to 600 mg daily because of disease progression, 1 had a PR and 2 had SD. Of the 147 patients, 56
entered a 4-year treatment extension phase for a longterm follow-up of up to 71 months.35 The objective
responses (PR þ SD) were similar to those observed initially (82%); however, this time 2 (2.7%) patients in the
600 mg daily group achieved complete response (CR).
Notably, a median overall survival (OS) of 57 months
was observed and found to be superior to the median survival of 19 months observed with historical controls.4
Patients who progressed in either group had their dosage
increased, which resulted in further clinical responses
(PR or SD in 26% and 15% of patients at 400 and 600
mg daily, respectively). Despite the clinical benefit
gained by increasing the dose of imatinib in patients
with progression of disease (PD), both 400 and 600 mg
daily resulted in a similar response rate.35

Cancer

Similarly, favorable antitumor results were observed
in a smaller-scale EORTC phase 2 study.36 In this study,
imatinib was administered at an initial dose of 800 mg
daily to 51 patients, of whom 27 had GIST. After more
than 13 months of treatment, the overall response rate
(CR þ PR þ SD) was 90%.
The Role of Mutational Status in Predicting
Response to Imatinib
In addition to being a prognostic indicator of poor outcome, kinase mutational status can also be used as a predictor of response to imatinib. Some patterns have been
observed consistently throughout various studies: 1)
patients carrying KIT exon 11 mutant GISTs on imatinib
400 or 600 mg daily were more likely to achieve tumor
control and longer survival rates (event-free survival, median OS and median time to tumor progression [TTP])
than those with KIT exon 9 mutations or those without
mutations; conversely, in a retrospective subgroup analysis of the EORTC 62,005 and SO033 trials, patients with
KIT exon 9 mutations achieved longer progression-free
survival (PFS) with imatinib 800 mg daily than with
400 mg daily35,37-40; 2) imatinib responses are similar
between deletions and point mutations within KIT exon
11 and between heterozygous and homozygous exon 11
mutants37,40; and 3) PDGFRA exon 18 D842V and
D846V mutations are typically resistant to imatinib
therapy, and their inhibition requires 10- to 20-fold
higher imatinib levels compared with PDGFRA
imatinib-sensitive mutations (V561D and deletions
DIMH842-845 and delI843).37,38,40
The NCCN guidelines indicate that the use of
mutational analysis in patients who will initiate imatinib
therapy can be considered if available, in particular if they
have primary disease with high-risk tumors, locally
advanced disease, or metastatic disease.41 In contrast, the
European Society of Medical Oncology guidelines recommend mutational analysis in the diagnostic workup of all
GISTs, providing that the availability of the information
may guide the initial treatment at the time of metastatic
relapse.21
What Is Progression?
Disease progression can be measured by different parameters, including tumor size, tumor density, number of metastatic lesions, new sites of disease, mixed pattern of
disease progression, and formation of new blood vessels,
among others. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) are based solely on tumor size, and

response to imatinib is measured by tumor shrinkage.
One of the first signs of disease recurrence in 81% of
GIST patients who initially responded to imatinib is the
formation of a nodule within a pre-existent metastasis
(nodule within a mass) characterized by its low density.42
Size-based criteria do not take into consideration the formation of these nodules, and the recently described Choi
criteria acknowledge changes in density that are relevant
for the definition of progression at least in the first-line
setting.43,44 Altogether, the identification of progression
in a given patient is often difficult and requires multidisciplinary assessment, involving the oncologist, the radiologists, and functional imaging specialists.
Rationale for the Use of High-Dose Imatinib
Although imatinib has been shown to be effective at a
dose of 400 mg daily, observations in patients with CML
have suggested that an increase in dose may likely result in
increased plasma exposure and improved clinical
response. In CML patients, imatinib plasma levels have
been shown to correlate with dose, as well as with complete cytogenetic responses and event-free survival.45,46
Similarly, in GIST, imatinib plasma concentration has
been found to be correlated with dose, but with substantial interpatient variability.34,47 Importantly, the outcome
of GIST patients was found to be significantly correlated
with imatinib trough levels at Day 29; patients with levels
<11,000 ng/mL at this date had a shorter PFS, in particular in the subgroup with KIT exon 11 (imatinib-sensitive)
mutations.47 Higher imatinib concentrations also correlate with a decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in
apoptosis, which in turn leads to changes in the cell membrane, resulting in an increase in the intracellular uptake
of imatinib.48 In both chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML) and GIST patients, there is a large interpatient
variability in imatinib blood levels, partly due to drug
interactions, concomitant diseases, or genetic polymor-

1850

phisms of cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in imatinib
metabolism.34,49,50 In addition, albumin, white blood
cells, granulocytes, and hemoglobin have been shown to
affect imatinib clearance and distribution.51,52 Given
these observations, there is a sound scientific rationale to
explore whether a higher dose provides additional clinical
benefit.
Imatinib 400 Versus 800 mg Daily:
Dose–Response Relationships in
Advanced/Metastatic GIST
Previous phase 1 and 2 studies support the benefit of escalating the dose of imatinib in progressing patients. However, these studies were not powered to distinguish
between the efficacy of standard- and high-dose imatinib
as a first-line treatment. Two large phase 3 trials (S0033
and 62,005) were conducted to compare the clinical benefit of imatinib at 400 and 800 mg daily in patients with
unresectable or metastatic GIST, with an option to cross
over to the higher dose on disease progression.53,54 Both
studies were designed similarly, so that the results could
be combined in a meta-analysis study.55 In a retrospective
subgroup analysis within this meta-analysis, the higher
dose of imatinib was associated with a better clinical outcome in patients with KIT exon 9 mutations.
In the EORTC/ISG/AGITG 62,005 trial, 946
patients with advanced or metastatic GIST from Europe
and Australasia were evaluated.54 At a median follow-up
of 760 days (25 months), the initial results of this trial
showed no differences in response between the standard(400 mg daily) and high-dose (800 mg daily) groups (Table 2), although a significantly longer PFS was associated
with the high-dose group. However, longer follow-up (40
months) revealed no significant difference in OS and PFS
between dose groups.56 After progression on standarddose imatinib, patients who crossed over to the high dose
observed additional clinical benefit (29.4% achieved PR

or SD) and an increase in TTP of approximately 33%.57
A retrospective analysis of the different mutational subgroups revealed that patients with KIT exon 9 mutations
treated with imatinib 800 mg daily had increased PFS (P
¼ .0013) and a 61% reduction in relative risk compared
with those with exon 11 mutations or without mutations.40 Results from the longer follow-up trial also
reported a marginally superior OS in patients with KIT
exon 9 mutations at a dose of 800 mg daily (P ¼ .057).56
No trend was observed in the subgroup analysis of the
SO033 trial, whereas in the combined meta-analysis of
both trials, the OS of the KIT exon 9 mutated subgroup
treated with 800 mg daily was 6 months superior to that
of patients treated up front with 400 mg daily (P ¼
.15).55 It is noteworthy that these observations were collected at a time when second-line treatment options were
more limited than in 2009.55 These observations were
unexpected, because previous studies had demonstrated
that patients with KIT exon 11 mutations have a better
response to imatinib at the standard dose compared with
those with exon 9 mutations. The response rate was not
significantly different between doses in any of the mutational groups analyzed. Importantly, in progressing
patients with KIT exon 9 mutations, dose escalation
resulted in a higher response rate (57%) compared with
those with exon 11 mutations (P ¼ .0017).40
The S0033 trial evaluated 694 patients with
advanced GIST from the United States and Canada.53
Patients from both standard- and high-dose imatinib
arms exhibited a similar antitumor response (Table 2).
There were also no significant differences in survival
between these doses. However, patients progressing on
imatinib 400 mg daily experienced a better clinical outcome after dose escalation to imatinib 800 mg daily (31%
achieved PR or SD) and experienced fewer side effects
than when initiating with the higher dose. A subsequent
mutational analysis revealed that patients with KIT exon 9
mutant GISTs, receiving imatinib at 800 mg daily, had a
higher chance of achieving CR or PR than those on imatinib 400 mg daily (Table 2).38 However, TTP and OS in
patients with KIT exon 9 mutations were not significantly
different between the doses.
Pooled data from the S0033 and 62,005 trials were
evaluated in a meta-analysis denoted Meta-GIST, with the
aim of increasing the power and precision of the results.55
This meta-analysis assessed trends in response to both 400
and 800 mg daily imatinib in 1640 patients, with a median
follow-up of 45 months. Analysis of the combined data
showed a small but significant increase in the median PFS of

Cancer

April 15, 2010

the high-dose arm by 4 months, and an increase of 4% in
the 3-year PFS (hazard ratio, 0.89 for both trials). The prognostic factor analysis, independent of dose, showed that
patients with KIT exon 11 mutations have a median PFS
(26 months) 2-fold greater than that of patients with KIT
exon 9 mutations (13 months). Similarly, the median OS
was twice as long in patients with KIT exon 11 mutations
(60 months) compared with patients harboring exon 9
mutations (31 months). Both the S0033 and 62,005 trials
showed a clinical advantage in patients carrying KIT exon 9
mutations treated with imatinib at 800 mg daily in this retrospective subgroup analysis; however, the S0033 study
reported an increase in the objective response but not in the
PFS of these patients. These differences could be due to the
small number of patients with KIT exon 9 mutations analyzed in the S0033 trial (n ¼ 32) compared with those in the
62,005 trial (n ¼ 58), and most likely the former trial was
not powered to detect any differences in survival. The predictive factor analysis of the Meta-GIST project revealed
that the presence or absence of KIT exon 9 mutations is the
only factor that significantly affects the relative benefit of
high-dose imatinib therapy. In these patients, the median
PFS was 6 months with imatinib at 400 mg daily, and 19
months with the higher dose of 800 mg daily (P ¼ .017).
Similarly, the 3-year PFS in exon 9 mutants was 5% and
17% in the standard- and high-dose arms, respectively. The
same trend was observed with OS but was not significant (P
¼ .15; median OS, 28 and 35 months with 400 and 800
mg daily, respectively). Both studies yielded the same conclusions regarding the unchanged benefit at 800 mg daily in
patients with KIT exon 11 mutations or without KIT/
PDGFRA mutations.
When to Consider High-Dose
Imatinib Therapy
Because results from clinical studies do not currently support an additional survival benefit with high-dose imatinib in the first-line setting, and because of its association
with severe adverse events, the NCCN and European Society of Medical Oncology guidelines still recommend initiating treatment of patients with unresectable or
metastatic GISTs with imatinib 400 mg daily.21,41 However, based on results from the Meta-GIST and other clinical studies, the European Society of Medical Oncology
guidelines now recommend using imatinib 800 mg daily
as a starting dose for patients harboring KIT exon 9 mutations, and the NCCN guidelines mention that ‘‘if molecular diagnosis is available and exon 9 positive, recent data
support use of imatinib at 800 mg daily.’’21,41

1851

Review Article

Figure 1. Proposed recommendation for use of high-dose
imatinib in metastatic patients is shown. *It is recommended
to escalate to 800 mg daily after 400 mg daily for at least 24 weeks.

In addition, dose escalation to 800 mg daily may be
appropriate in patients progressing on 400 mg daily. The
NCCN guidelines state that this may not result in benefit
in those patients who have progressed within 2 months after the initial dose. Also, they state that patients with limited progression can continue treatment at the same dose,
and that this should be escalated based on tolerability.15,41
The European Society of Medical Oncology guidelines
assert that dose escalation might be more beneficial in
patients with KIT exon 9 mutations who have initiated
treatment at 400 mg daily, or in instances where changes
in drug pharmacokinetics or secondary alterations occur.
Before dose escalation, they recommend that patient noncompliance or drug interactions should be ruled out as the
cause of progression.21
Taking into consideration the recommendations
from both the NCCN and European Society of Medical
Oncology guidelines, 2 major groups of patients should
be considered appropriate candidates for imatinib 800 mg
daily: 1) patients with KIT exon 9 mutations and 2)
patients progressing on the initial dose of imatinib
(Fig. 1). The use of high-dose imatinib is approved as the
standard of care in the European Union but still considered experimental in the United States.
Practical Considerations of High-Dose
Imatinib Therapy
Imatinib is well tolerated, and its side effects are usually
mild, although the severity of the adverse events increases
with dose.33,34 Development of toxicity and side effects

1852

can cause an interruption of treatment, occurring more
frequently with high-dose therapy. To avoid recurrence,
all patients receiving imatinib therapy should receive continuous treatment, because treatment interruption results
in disease progression at a median of 6 months.58,59
Patients receiving imatinib 800 mg daily experience
more severe dose-related side effects.33,53,54 Consequently, successful treatment in these patients relies on
prompt and effective management of adverse events and
toxicities. Observations pertaining to dose-related toxic
effects are common among clinical trials and can be summarized thus: 1) incidence of mild adverse events is frequent (99%) and similar in patients receiving low- or
high-dose (600 or 800 mg daily) imatinib treatments34,54;
2) severity of adverse events tends to increase with highdose imatinib—32% versus 50% (EORTC 62,005) and
43% versus 63% of patients (S0033) at 400 and 800 mg
daily, respectively (Table 3)53,54; and 3) dose interruptions and reductions correlate directly with high-dose
treatment (16%-40% vs 58%-64% of patients had dose
reductions and interruptions on 400 and 800 mg daily,
respectively).53,54
Nonhematologic toxicities

The most commonly observed nonhematologic toxicities in patients receiving imatinib include edema
(mainly periorbital), fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, myalgia or
musculoskeletal pain, skin rash, headache, and abdominal
and chest pain (Table 3). Edema, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, skin rash, and dyspnea (grade 3 or 4) have been
observed more frequently in patients receiving imatinib
800 mg daily,54 and were highly correlated with highdose imatinib administration in univariate and multivariate prognostic risk factor analyses.60 Dose reductions in
patients receiving imatinib 800 mg daily have been shown
to be mainly because of edema, nausea, and fatigue.53
Also, patients who crossed over to imatinib 800 mg daily
have been shown to experience more severe fatigue before
dose escalation (P ¼ .00001).57 In contrast to CML,
cardiovascular events rarely occurred in GIST patients
(Table 3).61
Hematologic toxicities

The most frequently reported hematologic side
effects in patients receiving imatinib include anemia and
granulocytopenia, particularly neutropenia (Table 3).
Thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage have also been
observed.53,54 Patients treated with imatinib 800 mg daily
experienced reduction in hemoglobulin count, but this

stabilized over time.54 High-dose imatinib was identified
as a prognostic risk factor for anemia in univariate and
multivariate analyses (P < .0001). Conversely, neutropenia has been shown to be dose independent (P ¼ .93).60
Anemia, hemorrhage, neutropenia, and cardiac toxicity
were also more severe in patients receiving imatinib 800
mg daily (Table 3).53,54 Patients who crossed over to
high-dose imatinib experienced more severe anemia,
although this subsequently stabilized. In contrast, neutropenia was less acute after crossover.57 Contrary to CML,
myelosuppression is an infrequent side effect in GIST
patients and is not dose related.33
Are There Other Situations Where Dose
Escalation May Be Considered?
Low trough levels of imatinib

Several retrospective analyses, including that
reported recently from the B2222 series, suggest that
patients with imatinib plasma levels below the clinical
therapeutic threshold might experience disease progression not necessarily related to imatinib resistance. Dose
escalation may overcome drug clearance mechanisms and/
or increase therapeutic levels that decrease over time.

However, dose escalation is currently only performed
according to response or mutational status. Recent retrospective and ongoing studies that correlate imatinib
plasma levels with response might change the role that
blood level testing and dose escalation play in achieving
further response to imatinib in the near future. Both
CML and GIST patients exhibit high intervariability in
imatinib plasma levels.45-47,62 In 1 study conducted by
Bui et al, advanced GIST patients with high trough imatinib levels (>1000 ng/mL) were long-term responders; in
contrast, patients with low imatinib levels (<250 ng/mL
at 400 mg daily or 374 ng/mL at 800 mg daily) showed
poor compliance with therapy.62 Demetri et al showed
recently that patients with a plasma exposure (Cmin)
below 1100 ng/mL had a low objective response rate in
addition to a faster TTP, which may contribute to drug
failure in patients with advanced GIST. In particular,
patients with KIT exon 11 mutations had a better outcome when imatinib plasma exposure levels were >1110
ng/mL.47 Taken together, these findings suggest that a
minimal plasma threshold may be necessary to achieve
and maintain a clinical response. In the future, dose escalation in patients with low trough levels of imatinib

despite adequate compliance may represent a third situation where higher dose of imatinib may be considered.
This question is at present unsolved and requires additional investigation.
High-Dose Imatinib in an Adjuvant Setting

Surgical resection is the standard of care for patients
with localized resectable GISTs. However, approximately
half of patients who undergo surgical resection for primary GIST will develop disease recurrence after 5 years.4
In these patients, the use of imatinib in an adjuvant setting
after complete resection may delay recurrence, as shown
initially in uncontrolled trials.63,64 Recently, the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group phase 3 Z9001
trial reported the results of 682 patients with high-risk
GIST randomly allocated to adjuvant imatinib 400 mg
daily for 1 year. In patients receiving adjuvant imatinib, at
a median follow-up of 19.7 months, the 1-year PFS was
98%, compared with 83% in the placebo arm (P <
.0001); 8% versus 20% had events, respectively. This trial
also showed that patients with high-risk GISTs (>10 cm
or high mitotic rate) received an additional benefit after
1 year of therapy.65 The success of these trials has led to
the recent approval of adjuvant imatinib 400 mg daily in
the United States for the treatment of GIST. Nonetheless,
in patients with KIT exon 9 mutant GISTs, the use of adjuvant imatinib 800 mg daily could possibly be more beneficial given previous observations of the use of high-dose
imatinib in this subpopulation.40 However, the benefit of
high-dose imatinib in an adjuvant setting in patients with
KIT exon 9 mutations remains to be addressed.
High-Dose Imatinib in a Neoadjuvant Setting

In the neoadjuvant setting, imatinib has been shown
to shrink tumor size (34%-85%), making once unresectable or metastatic tumors resectable masses.66,67 Neoadjuvant therapy has been shown to be well tolerated and to
increase survival in advanced/metastatic patients postsurgery (2-year PFS of 61%-77%).68-70 Overall, patients
have been reported to receive neoadjuvant imatinib for 2
to 26 months.66-70 Patients treated with imatinib too long
before surgery have a risk of developing secondary resistance; a median of 3.5 months on imatinib therapy was
reported as the time to best response, and ideally surgery
should not be delayed much longer than that.54,68
Various neoadjuvant or adjuvant combination studies have used different doses of imatinib to treat advanced
patients; however, none was powered to distinguish efficacy between doses.66,68-72 In some cases, preoperative

1854

imatinib was given at an initial dose of 400 mg daily and
increased to 600 to 800 mg daily on progression, or was
given at 600 to 800 mg daily at the outset.66,69-72 One
case study reported on a patient with a localized high-risk
tumor, who received neoadjuvant imatinib therapy at an
initial dose of 800 mg daily for 2 weeks, and was later
reduced to 600 mg daily. The patient had a complete surgical resection after 10 weeks of treatment and was disease
free for 24 months after surgery.73
Two recent phase 2 studies in patients with
advanced GISTs combined neoadjuvant and adjuvant
therapy at the maximum approved dose of 600 mg daily
in both settings. Preoperative imatinib was given for 3 to
7 days in 1 study and 8 to 12 weeks in the other, but both
followed postoperative treatment for 24 months.69,71 In
the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0132/American
College of Radiology Imaging Network 6665 study, localized and metastatic patients had an OS of 93% and 91%
and a 2-year PFS of 83% and 77%, respectively. The
other study by McAuliffe et al showed that patients with
localized and metastatic disease had an increase in apoptosis and decrease of tumor blood flow while on preoperative imatinib, and that postoperative therapy prolongs
PFS (1-year PFS, 94%; 2-year PFS, 87%). In this study,
patients with KIT exon 11 mutations showed a 14%
increase in tumor apoptosis after neoadjuvant imatinib,
whereas 1 patient with KIT exon 9 mutations did not
show an increase in apoptosis, possibly because of the use
of imatinib 600 mg daily instead of the recommended
dose of 800 mg daily for this subpopulation.40,71 At this
stage, studies suggest that a dose of 400 to 600 mg daily is
sufficient in a neoadjuvant setting. However, in cases
where a proper response has not been achieved due to
inadequate imatinib trough levels or presence of KIT exon
9 mutations, adjustments to the neoadjuvant dose might
be possible, although this has not yet been explored.
When to Consider an Alternative Therapy
to High-Dose Imatinib
Therapy with alternative tyrosine kinase inhibitors is recommended in cases of imatinib resistance largely due to
additional secondary mutations, or intolerance due to toxicities related to dose escalation (eg, extensive edema or
hypertension).
Sunitinib (Sutent, formerly SU11248, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, New York, NY) is the only other tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of GISTs,
specifically as a second-line treatment for patients with
unresectable and/or metastatic GISTs who have failed

previous imatinib therapy. In a pivotal phase 3 trial,
patients with unresectable imatinib-resistant GIST treated
with sunitinib had an median TTP and PFS 4 times longer (27.3 and 24.1 weeks, respectively) than those
randomized to placebo (6.4 and 6 weeks, respectively; P
< .0001 for both).74 In another study, sunitinib was
found to be more effective in patients with KIT exon 9
mutant GISTs compared with those with exon 11 mutations (PFS 19.4 vs 5.1 months).75 Of note, this observation was obtained in patients with advanced GIST
pretreated with imatinib in whom the presence of additional mutations in other exons of the KIT gene, yielding
imatinib-resistant mutated KIT proteins, have been
observed in a large proportion of patients. In addition,
sunitinib was found to be sensitive against KIT imatinibresistant secondary mutations (exon 13 or 14). Adverse
events in both studies were generally mild to moderate,
but sunitinib-related serious adverse events were observed,
including hand–foot syndrome, diarrhea, hypertension,
and hypothyroidism.74,76 A phase 3 clinical trial
(NCT00372567) is underway to distinguish the benefits
and side effects of taking sunitinib versus imatinib at
800 mg daily in patients progressing on the standard-dose
of imatinib.77 The NCCN and European Society of Medical Oncology guidelines recommend switching to sunitinib on progression or intolerance while receiving imatinib
therapy. Moreover, both the NCCN and European Society of Medical Oncology guidelines recommend that
patients resistant to imatinib and sunitinib be considered
for a clinical trial.21,77 Nilotinib (Tasigna, formerly
AMN107, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland),
a potent inhibitor of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, is currently in clinical development for the
treatment of imatinib-resistant patients with GISTs. A
phase 1 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of nilotinib alone or in combination with imatinib reported clinical activity in imatinib-resistant patients (SD in 72% and
56% of patients, respectively), and this observation was
confirmed in a recently reported compassionate use program.78,79 Nilotinib has been investigated in a prospective
multicentric phase 3 randomized clinical trial versus best
supportive care, imatinib, or sunitinib in patients failing
both agents, the results of which are awaited.
Conclusions
The introduction of imatinib revolutionized the way in
which GIST patients are managed. Survival rates of
advanced GIST patients on imatinib therapy are far superior to those observed in the preimatinib era. The use of

Cancer

April 15, 2010

imatinib 400 mg daily provides a similar benefit to that
observed with imatinib 800 mg daily; therefore, 400 mg
daily is the recommended starting dose. Nonetheless, imatinib at a high dose of 800 mg daily provides an additional
benefit in 2 major patient populations: 1) patients who
initially respond to 400 mg daily but subsequently show
disease progression, possibly due to inadequate drug
blood levels; and 2) patients who present initially with
KIT exon 9 mutations. Although the use of high-dose
imatinib is suggested by the NCCN and European Society of Medical Oncology guidelines in these 2 populations, it is not standard care, and clinicians should
consider whether imatinib 800 mg daily represents an
appropriate choice for patients in these categories. Despite
the increased incidence in severe toxicities associated with
the higher dose, these appear to be manageable in the majority of patients with careful use of supportive therapies.
The use of imatinib in an adjuvant setting was recently
granted approval because of the increase in postoperative
survival; however, more research is required to better
define the period and dose of treatment along with those
patients most likely to benefit from the therapy. The use
of high-dose imatinib in the pre- and postoperative settings has not been investigated.
