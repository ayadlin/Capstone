Summary

Author Manuscript

Small-molecule inhibitors targeting growth factor receptors have failed to show efficacy for brain
cancers, potentially due to inability to achieve sufficient drug levels in the CNS. Targeting nononcogene tumor co-dependencies provides an alternative approach, particularly if drugs with high
brain penetration can be identified. Here we demonstrate that the highly lethal brain cancer
glioblastoma (GBM) is remarkably dependent on cholesterol for survival, rendering these tumors
sensitive to Liver X receptor (LXR) agonist-dependent cell death. We show that LXR-623, a
clinically viable, highly brain-penetrant LXRα-partial/LXRβ-full agonist selectively kills GBM
cells in an LXRβ- and cholesterol-dependent fashion, causing tumor regression and prolonged
survival in mouse models. Thus, a metabolic co-dependency provides a pharmacological means to
kill growth factor-activated cancers in the CNS.

Introduction
Malignant brain tumors are among the most devastating types of cancer. Despite
improvements in surgical techniques, development of various cytotoxic chemotherapy
regimens, and advances in the delivery of focused radiation, the survival of most brain
cancer patients, including those with glioblastoma (GBM), has not appreciably improved
over the past 50 years.

Author Manuscript

The blood-brain barrier prevents many circulating molecules from entering into the brain.
This includes most cytotoxic chemotherapies and targeted agents, and contributes to
treatment failure (Deeken and Löscher, 2007). Thus, despite actionable drug targets such as
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is amplified and/or mutated in nearly
60% of cases (Brennan et al., 2013), EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have so far proven
ineffective (Cloughesy et al., 2014; Furnari et al., 2015) in part because they do not reach
therapeutic intratumoral drug levels in the central nervous system (CNS) (Vivanco et al.,
2012). This suboptimal dosing frequently leads to the appearance of multiple resistance
mechanisms (Furnari et al., 2015).

Author Manuscript

Cancer cells, due to alterations in their biochemical and signaling state, may become
dependent on specific enzymes or transcription factors that are not themselves oncogenic,
opening up treatment possibilities. This process, known as non-oncogene addiction (Galluzzi
et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2009; Solimini et al., 2007) or non-oncogene co-dependency (Raj et
al., 2011), may extend the pharmacopeia of cancer drugs to include brain-penetrant
compounds that act on non-traditional targets. Importantly, co-dependencies can be shaped
both by specific oncogenes that reprogram cellular metabolism and signaling and by the
local biochemical environment in which tumor cells grow (Galluzzi et al., 2013).

The unique metabolic environment of the brain may generate actionable vulnerabilities. The
brain, for instance, is the most cholesterol rich organ of the body, containing approximately
20% of total body cholesterol (Dietschy, 2009). However, the brain cholesterol pool is
virtually separate from cholesterol metabolism in the periphery. Because cholesterol cannot
be transported across the blood-brain barrier into the CNS, almost all brain cholesterol is
synthesized de novo (Björkhem and Meaney, 2004; Dietschy and Turley, 2001). Astrocytes
synthesize the majority of brain cholesterol from glucose, glutamine or acetate-derived
acetyl-CoA and supply cholesterol to neighboring cells, including neurons, in the form of
ApoE-containing HDL-like lipoprotein particles (Hayashi et al., 2004; Karten et al., 2006;
Wahrle et al., 2004). Neurons and astrocytes both produce oxysterols as products of
cholesterol metabolism, which act as endogenous ligands for the liver X receptors (LXRs) to
decrease excess cellular cholesterol levels by promoting efflux through sterol transporters
such as ABCA1 and suppressing uptake through IDOL-dependent degradation of LDLR
(Chen et al., 2013; Repa et al., 2000; Venkateswaran et al., 2000; Zelcer et al., 2009). This
negative feedback system complements suppression of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the
rate-limiting enzyme for sterol synthesis, when cholesterol levels rise (Björkhem, 2006;
Brown and Goldstein, 1980) to maintain cholesterol homeostasis within distinct cell types in
the brain. Statins, which block HMCGR, and synthetic LXR agonists have been suggested as
anti-cancer agents. A recent study reported that LXR agonist suppressed metastasis in the
periphery through an APOE-dependent mechanism (Pencheva et al., 2014). In the brain, the
efficacy of targeting either cholesterol synthesis or LXR activation may depend both on the
specific tumor genotype and on the tissue-specific context required for cancer cell survival.

We reasoned that tumor cells in the brain may behave in a parasitic fashion with regard to
cholesterol, obtaining CNS-derived cholesterol while suppressing endogenous LXR-ligand
synthesis, enabling GBM cells to access a nearly limitless supply of cholesterol to fuel their
growth. If this hypothesis is correct, GBM cells may be exquisitely vulnerable to synthetic
brain-penetrant LXR ligands that would otherwise spare normal brain cell constituents,
including astrocytes and neurons.

Results
GBM cells display dysregulated cholesterol metabolism

Author Manuscript

We previously demonstrated that mutant EGFR signaling in GBM cells upregulates LDLR
expression (Guo et al., 2011), suggesting that these tumor cells may rely on exogenous
cholesterol for survival. Therefore, to determine the relative dependency of GBM cells on
endogenous cholesterol synthesis versus uptake, we examined the status of the de novo
cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in GBM and normal brain specimens using data from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Brennan et al., 2013; Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network, 2008). We determined the expression of mRNAs encoding three key enzymes:
HMGCS1 that converts acetyl-CoA to HMG-CoA; HMGCR, the rate limiting step in the
pathway that converts HMG-CoA to mevalonate, and DHCR24 which ultimately converts
desmosterol to cholesterol. Expression of these critical enzymes was coordinately
suppressed in GBM clinical samples relative to normal brain (p < 0.001 for each) (Figure
1A). We reasoned that if GBM cells suppress de novo cholesterol synthesis, then they should

be relatively resistant to statins, which target HMCGR. In contrast, normal human astrocytes
(NHAs), which rely primarily on endogenous synthesis, should be highly vulnerable.
Consistent with this hypothesis, both lovastatin and atorvastatin caused significant cell death
of NHAs while showing limited activity against two independent models of EGFRvIIIexpressing GBMs – U87EGFRvIII cells, which are derived by overexpression of EGFRvIII
in an established GBM cell line (Wang et al., 2006), and GBM39, which is a patient-derived
GBM line that maintains endogenous EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII expression in
neurosphere culture (Sarkaria et al., 2007) (Figure 1B and S1A).

Author Manuscript

Consistent with the notion that GBM cells obtain cholesterol primarily through uptake,
LDLR protein was significantly elevated in GBM clinical samples relative to normal brain in
tissue microarray analyses (Figure 1C). LDLR protein was also substantially elevated in
GBM cells relative to NHAs in culture (Figure 1D), and GBM cells took up three- to fourfold more LDL than did NHAs (Figure 1E, 1F, S1B). Removal of lipids from the culture
media caused extensive GBM cell death while having no effect on the viability of NHAs,
(Figure S1C), motivating us to further examine the role of cholesterol uptake in GBM
survival.

Author Manuscript

In non-cancerous cells, excess cholesterol is used to synthesize oxysterols, which act as
endogenous LXR ligands to suppress LDL uptake and promote the efflux of cholesterol
from the cell (Repa et al., 2000; Venkateswaran et al., 2000). However, the activity of this
pathway in GBM cells and in many other cancer types (Lin and Gustafsson, 2015) is not
well understood. Therefore, we performed mass spectrometric analysis of GBM cell lines
and NHAs to measure endogenous LXR ligand levels and surveyed the mRNA expression of
the enzymes that produce these endogenous LXR ligands in these cells, as well as more
broadly across GBMS in the TCGA dataset. The levels of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC), 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22-OHC), 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4b-OHC), 27hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), and the downstream product of 7α-hydroxycholesterol, 7αhydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (7a-OH-ONE), were significantly reduced in GBM cells relative
to NHAs (Figure 1G, S1D), as were the mRNA levels of the enzymes that catalyze their
production (Figures S1E, S1F). In particular, CYP46A1, the most highly expressed enzyme
that catalyzes oxysterol synthesis in the brain, was reduced nearly ten-fold in GBMs in the
TCGA dataset (Figure S1F). mRNA expression analysis of the enzymes that catabolize LXR
ligands revealed HSD3B7 is expressed at a higher level in GBM cells relative to normal
brain in the TCGA data set (Figure S1G), raising the possibility that catabolism of LXR
ligands may also play a role in GBM cholesterol homeostasis. Taken together, these data
demonstrate that GBM cells have a decreased capacity to produce endogenous LXR ligands.

GBM cells show selective vulnerability to LXR agonists
We hypothesized that the relatively low levels of endogenous LXR ligands in GBM cells
would render them selectively sensitive to exogenous LXR ligands. We first tested the effect
of exogenous administration of LXR ligands that are normally synthesized by cells in the
presence of excess cholesterol. 24-OHC induced a dramatic dose-dependent increase in
GBM cell death in vitro (Figure 1H, S1H). Importantly, NHAs, which synthesize 24-OHC
(Figure 1G), were insensitive to exogenous 24-OHC administration (Figures 1H, S1H).

Therefore, we reasoned that synthetic LXR agonists might also kill GBM cells while sparing
NHAs.
We focused our initial investigation on LXR-623, a synthetic LXR agonist originally
developed for cardiovascular indications and tested in patients (Hong and Tontonoz, 2014).
A phase I clinical trial raised the possibility of brain penetration (Katz et al. J Clin
Pharmacol. 2009), motivating our focus on this drug. Consistent with our proposed model,
LXR-623 potently killed U87EGFRvIII and GBM39 cells in vitro while completely sparing
NHAs (Figure 1I and S1I-L). LXR-623 also increased ABCA1 protein and decreased LDLR
protein levels in all three cell lines (Figure 1J). These results prompted a deeper examination
of LXR-623 as a potential therapy for GBM.
LXR-623 achieves therapeutic levels in GBM cells in the brain

Author Manuscript

In a healthy participant trial of LXR-623 (2-(2-chloro-4-fluorobenzyl)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-7(trifluoromethyl)-2H-indazole) (Figure S2A), subjects experienced mild to moderate CNS
side effects, suggesting that this compound crosses the blood-brain barrier (Katz et al.,
2009). Consistent with this premise, LXR-623 levels in the brains of nude mice treated daily
by oral gavage were higher than plasma levels at two or eight hours after dosing (Figure 2A,
S2B).

Author Manuscript

Many of the undesirable hyperlipidemic effects of synthetic LXR agonists are mediated
through LXRα in the liver and adipose tissue (Bradley et al., 2007; Joseph et al., 2002a,
2002b; Schultz et al., 2000). Previous studies had indicated that LXR-623, unlike
structurally distinct LXR agonists such as GW3965, does not activate hepatic lipogenesis
(Quinet et al., 2009) because it is an LXRα-partial/LXRβ-full agonist with a unique
transcriptional cofactor recruitment profile (Quinet et al., 2009; Wrobel et al., 2008).
Therefore, we compared the abilities of LXR-623 and GW3965 to induce target gene
expression in the brain and peripheral tissues. LXR-623 significantly induced the expression
of LXR target genes Abcg1 and Idol in cerebral cortex tissue in a similar fashion to
GW3965, and also induced Abca1, although not as effectively as GW3965. LXR-623 did
not induce Srebp1c in cerebral cortex (Figure 2B). LXR-623 also did not induce LXR target
gene expression in the liver and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) (Figure 2C-D).
These data suggested that at least two special properties of LXR-623 – high CNS penetrance
and reduced activity on LXRα – may provide a therapeutic window for treating GBM, and
possibly other brain cancers.

Author Manuscript

We next performed a pilot study of LXR-623 treatment in an in vivo intracranial GBM
xenograft model. We examined the potential relationship between intracranial GBM growth,
as monitored by non-invasive fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) imaging, and
intratumoral LXR-623 levels. As shown in Figure 2E, LXR-623 reached low-μM
concentrations within intracranial GBMs, meeting or exceeding the concentrations required
to kill GBM cells in culture (Figure 1I), and significantly reduced GBM tumor growth in
vivo (Figure 2F). These data demonstrate favorable brain penetration and potent anti-GBM
activity for LXR-623 in vivo.

LXR-623 induces cell death in established and patient-derived GBMs

Author Manuscript

We extended our analysis of LXR-623 effects to a panel of established GBM cell lines
(Figures 3A-B, S3A-B) and patient-derived GBM neurosphere cultures (Figure 3C-D) and
found that LXR-623 suppressed LDLR expression, increased expression of the ABCA1
efflux transporter, and induced substantial cell death in all of the GBM samples tested. The
brain metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-361, which harbors ERBB2 amplification,
was also highly sensitive to LXR-623-dependent cell death in a concentration-dependent
manner, raising the possibility that the drug could also have activity against systemic cancers
that metastasize to the brain (Figure S3C-D).
LXR-623 Induces GBM cell death through activation of LXRβ

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To determine whether LXR-623 promotes its effects on GBM cells through activation of
LXR, we first examined the effect of LXR-623 on gene expression. Gene microarray
analysis demonstrated upregulation of mRNAs encoding the ABCA1 cholesterol efflux
transporter and the E3 ligase IDOL, which targets the LDLR for degradation (Figure 4A),
and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed the anticipated transcriptional effects on
lipid metabolism that are characteristic of LXR activation (Figure 4A). In contrast to
GW3965, which induced ApoE-mediated suppression of metastasis in melanoma (Pencheva
et al., 2014), we did not observe induction of APOE expression in GBM cells or NHA
treated with LXR-623 (Figure 4A), indicating an ApoE-independent mechanism. Validation
of our microarray results via qPCR and immunoblotting revealed concentration-dependent
increases in ABCA1 and IDOL expression, and enhanced LDLR degradation (Figures 4B,
1J). Although LXR forms a heterodimer with retinoid X receptors (RXRs), which are
expressed in patient GBM samples (Figure S4A), treatment of U87EGFRvIII cells with the
RXR agonist bexarotene did not induce cell death or LXR target gene expression, despite
inducing RXR target gene expression (Figures S4B-S4D). This suggests a specific role for
LXR activation in LXR-623 induced cell death.
The two LXR isotypes – LXRα and LXRβ – display different tissue distributions and have
been shown to vary among some tumor types, but their relative expression in many cancers,
including glioblastoma, remains, to date, unknown (Lin and Gustafsson, 2015). We found
that LXRβ expression was nearly eightfold greater than LXRα in U87EGFRvIII cells and
nearly fourfold greater in the patient-derived GBM39 neurosphere culture (Figure 4C).
Analysis of the TCGA dataset similarly showed that LXRβ is the predominant LXR isotype
in GBM (Figure 4D) and that its expression is unaffected by EGFR mutational status (Figure
S4E).

Author Manuscript

To determine whether LXR-623 mediates its effects in GBM through LXRβ, we knocked
down both LXRs by RNA-interference and assessed the impact on LXR-623 biochemical
and functional responses. siRNA-mediated knockdown of LXRβ, but not LXRα, in GBM
cells inhibited the upregulation of ABCA1 and IDOL expression, limited degradation of
LDLR, and prevented cell death in response to LXR-623 (Figures 4E-4G, S4F-J). Further,
the LXR inverse agonist SR9243, which has been shown to promote tumor cell death in
prostate, colon, and lung cancer models (Flaveny et al., 2015), failed to cause GBM cell

death despite robust inhibition of LXR target genes (Figure S4K-L). These results show that
LXR-623 promotes its anti-tumor activity in GBM specifically by activating LXRβ.
Depletion of cholesterol drives LXR-623-induced killing of GBM cells
Our finding that LXRβ activation suppressed LDLR and induced expression of the ABCA1
efflux transporter and that this was concomitant with promotion of tumor cell death, raised
the possibility that LXR-623 kills GBM cells by reducing cellular cholesterol. To test this
idea, we measured the effect of LXR-623 on LDL uptake and cholesterol efflux. LXR-623
inhibited LDL uptake and induced cholesterol efflux in GBM cells (p < 0.001 for each)
(Figures 5A, 5B, S5A-C), resulting in a significant reduction in cellular cholesterol content
(Figure 5C, S5D).

Author Manuscript

We have described a chemical proteomic assay that uses a photoreactive, clickable, sterolbased probe to survey cholesterol-binding proteins in human cells (Hulce et al., 2013). Using
this methodology, we found that LXR-623 induced a concentration-dependent increase in
sterol probe binding to proteins in U87EGFRvIII cells (Figures 5D). Because the sterol
probe competes with endogenous cholesterol for interaction with cholesterol-binding
proteins (Hulce et al., 2013), these results provide further evidence that LXR-623 depletes
intracellular cholesterol and, by doing so, enhances sterol probe-protein interactions in GBM
cells.

Author Manuscript

We reasoned that if LXR-623 kills GBM by depleting cholesterol, the addition of exogenous
cholesterol should prevent LXR-623-induced cell death. Consistent with this hypothesis,
adding cholesterol that was complexed to methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which enables cholesterol
to permeate into cells, to the cultures fully rescued LXR-623-induced cell death in both
established and patient-derived GBM cell lines (Figure 6A). Cholesterol repletion did not
affect LDLR or ABCA1 levels (Figure 6B), indicating that the rescue effect of cholesterol
was not mediated by altering LXR-623 activity. Further, exposure to methyl-β-cyclodextrin
(MβCD), a chemical means of decreasing cellular cholesterol levels (Caliceti et al., 2012;
Christian et al., 1997), also reduced cholesterol levels (Figure S6A) and caused GBM cell
death, an effect that was considerably greater in GBM cells than NHAs (Figures 6C, S6B).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that GBM cells have an enhanced reliance on
cholesterol for survival and that LXR-623 induces GBM cell death by depleting cellular
cholesterol.
LXR-623 efficacy in intracranial patient-derived GBM xenograft models

Author Manuscript

The relative efficacy (Figure 3) and specificity (Figure 1I, 2B-D) of LXR-623 against GBM
cells, as well as the high brain penetrance of the drug (Figure 2A), inspired us to assess the
potential efficacy and toxicity of this drug in a relevant pre-clinical animal model of GBM.
Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic impact of LXR-623 in mice bearing patientderived GBM orthotopic xenografts. Oral administration of LXR-623 (400 mg/kg) to mice
bearing GBM39 cells engineered to express the infrared fluorescent protein 720 (IRFP720)
caused a striking inhibition of tumor growth (Figure 7A-B) and highly significant
prolongation of survival (Figure 7C).

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant increase in ABCA1 protein expression
(p < 0.01) and a significant decrease in LDLR protein expression, (p < 0.001) in LXR-623treated GBM tumors (Figure 7D-E). LXR-623 induced a greater than ten-fold increase in
TUNEL staining, (p < 0.001) (Figure 7D-E), demonstrating that it induces substantial
apoptosis in GBM tumors. Importantly, no change in the number of neurons in the brain was
seen response to LXR-623 and no drug-induced cell death was detected in normal brain
(Figures S7A-B). Further, mice bearing GBMs maintained their body weights throughout
LXR-623 treatment (Figure S7C), and showed no evidence of fatty liver (Figure S7D), a
known consequence of LXR-target gene activation in the periphery (Chisholm et al., 2003).
These findings are consistent with the high penetration of the LXR-623 into the brain
relative to the periphery (Figures 2A-B) and the relative lack of LXR-target gene induction
in peripheral tissues (Figures 2C-D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that LXR-623
selectively kills GBM cells with excellent efficacy in vivo and prolongs survival in a
clinically-relevant, patient-derived GBM model.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The brain is biochemically separated from the rest of the body by the blood-brain barrier,
which prevents many compounds and molecules from entering the CNS. The blood-brain
barrier presents challenges to achieving therapeutic concentrations of drugs in the brain
without causing serious dose-limiting toxicities in peripheral organs, which likely
contributes to the lack of clinical activity for most brain cancer treatments tested to date,
including those that act on compelling drug targets. GBM, for instance, is one of the most
deeply sequenced human cancers (Brennan et al., 2013; Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network, 2008; Lawrence et al., 2014; Parsons et al., 2008). However, this information had
yet to improve the outcome for GBM patients.
Motivated by the persistent clinical failure and the lack of therapeutic options for brain
cancers, we adopted an alternative strategy designed to take advantage of a targetable
metabolic co-dependency using a highly brain penetrant drug. We focused on cholesterol
homeostasis because: 1) GBM cells are highly dependent on cholesterol for survival
(Bovenga et al., 2015); 2) EGFR mutations can regulate cholesterol homeostasis in GBM
and possibly in other types of cancers (Gabitova et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2011); 3) the brain
has a unique mechanism of cholesterol regulation that may expose a targetable vulnerability
specific to tumor cells in this organ (Dietschy and Turley, 2001); and 4) anecdotal evidence
from a Phase 1 clinical trial raised the possibility that a highly brain penetrant compound,
LXR-623, could be used to exploit this vulnerability (Katz et al., 2009).

Author Manuscript

Most of the cells in the brain are dependent on astrocyte-synthesized cholesterol for survival
(Nieweg et al., 2009). Here we show that GBM cells exploit this tissue-specific physiology
to fuel their growth. By upregulating LDLR to enhance cholesterol uptake while
concurrently suppressing de novo synthesis of cholesterol and oxysterols, GBMs evade two
key negative feedback mechanisms of cholesterol homeostasis: 1) feedback inhibition of
HMGCR, the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, and 2) activation of LXRs by
oxysterols to inhibit LDL uptake and induce cholesterol efflux. It is remarkable that
CYP46A1, the main oxysterol-synthesizing enzyme in the brain, was suppressed ten-fold in

GBM tissue relative to normal brain. These coordinated metabolic adaptations give tumor
cells access to an abundant and uninterrupted source of cholesterol. De novo cholesterol
synthesis consumes 26 reducing equivalents of NADPH (Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011),
and it is tempting to speculate that the reliance of GBM cells on CNS-derived cholesterol
enables them to direct their cellular NADPH, a key reducing agent in relatively short supply
(Pavlova and Thompson, 2016), towards buffering ROS and synthesizing other
macromolecules (Vander Heiden et al., 2009). This coordinated set of metabolic adaptations
likely enhances the growth of GBMs in the brain, but also makes them exquisitely and
selectively vulnerable to exogenous LXR agonists.

A strong case has been made for nuclear hormone receptor modulators as potential cancer
drugs (Gronemeyer et al., 2004), including LXR modulators that show activity against
melanoma, intestinal cancers, squamous cell cancers, prostate cancers cells and breast
cancer cell lines (Flaveny et al., 2015; Gabitova et al., 2015; Lin and Gustafsson, 2015; Lo
Sasso et al., 2013; Nguyen-Vu et al., 2013; Pencheva et al., 2014; Pommier et al., 2013).
However, what is unanticipated and important from our studies is the critical role that tissue
type and organ context seems to play in determining the activity of a specific LXR
modulator. In peripheral melanomas, activation of LXRβ by GW3965 potently suppresses
metastasis by transcriptional induction of tumoral and stromal ApoE (Pencheva et al., 2014).
In the same study, however, GW3965 did not kill melanoma cells. In contrast, we show that
LXR-623 kills GBM cells specifically by depleting them of cholesterol, independent of any
effect on ApoE. We also found that the LXR inverse agonist SR9243, which was shown to
have activity against a variety of cancer cell lines through its ability to inhibit the Warburg
effect (Flaveny et al., 2015), has no anti-tumor effect on GBM cells, despite robust LXR
target gene inhibition. Of course, differences in the transcriptional regulation/cofactor
recruitment profiles of specific LXR modulators and the expression of LXR isoforms may
contribute to the gamut of responses to LXR agonists and inverse agonists observed thus far
in cancer models. It is also alternatively plausible that individual cancers respond differently
to the same drugs as a consequence of the interplay between their specific genotype,
metabolic state, and the tissue context to which they are exposed. Importantly, actionable
metabolic co-dependencies are likely to be shaped both by specific tumor cell oncogenes
that reprogram cellular metabolism and by the local biochemical environment to which the
tumor cells must adapt their metabolic circuitry for growth and survival (Galluzzi et al.,
2013).

LXR-623 also showed a remarkably specific activity against GBMs in vivo, sparing normal
cells, including neurons, in the brain and failing to elicit obvious toxicity in peripheral
tissues. Three features may contribute to the specificity we found in our in vitro and in vivo
models. First, the intact cellular cholesterol homeostasis machinery that is present in neurons
and glia, but absent in GBM cells, may render normal brain cells less sensitive to LXR-623.
Astrocytes rely on de novo cholesterol synthesis for survival and they are not dependent on
cholesterol uptake, rendering them vulnerable to statins, but not to LXR-623. Similarly, no
decrease in neuron number was seen and no neuronal cell death was detected in LXR-623treated mice in vivo, indicating that neurons were less sensitive to the LXR-623 than were
GBM cells. Thus, normal brain cell insensitivity to LXR-623 may be due to reliance on
endogenous synthesis of cholesterol and intact negative feedback through synthesis of

endogenous oxysterols. This is in contrast to GBMs, which rely primarily on uptake of
cholesterol, rather than de novo production, and do not synthesize endogenous oxysterols.
Second, the relatively high LXR-623 brain/plasma ratio limits the dose needed to reach
therapeutic levels in tumor cells in the brain, thus limiting peripheral drug exposure. Third,
LXR-623 is an LXRα-partial/LXRβ-full agonist (Wrobel et al., 2008) and many of the
undesirable effects of synthetic LXR agonists are mediated through LXRα, including
hepatic lipogenesis (Bradley et al., 2007; Joseph et al., 2002a, 2002b; Schultz et al., 2000).
On this note, we did not detect fatty livers in tumor-bearing mice treated with LXR-623 at a
dose that dramatically shrunk GBMs in the brain.

Author Manuscript

Taken together, our data suggest that LXR-623 could offer a viable pharmacological therapy
for GBM patients who currently have no effective treatment options. Similar to GBMs,
tumors that metastasize to the brain also commonly contain amplification and gain-offunction mutations of EGFR and erbB family members, including HER2 (encoded by
ERBB2) (Brastianos et al., 2015). LXR-623 potently killed ERBB2-amplified MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells that were derived from a brain metastasis, raising the possibility
that LXR-623 might further be used to treat systemic tumors that migrate to the brain.
Future studies are warranted to determine the potential efficacy of this drug for the treatment
of an array of brain cancers.

Experimental Procedures
Additional details are available in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Cell Culture

Author Manuscript

The human glioma cell line U87 (or U-87MG) was purchased from ATCC and the
U87EGFRvIII isogenic GBM cell line was obtained as described previously (Wang et al.,
2006). U87EGFRvIII, U251, T98, U373 and A172 GBM cell lines were cultured in
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM, Cellgro), and PC9 cells were cultured in
RPMI1640 (Gibco), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone) and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C.
MDA-MB-361 cells were cultured in Leibovitz's L-15 media (Cellgro) supplemented with
20% FBS in a humidified 0% CO2 incubator at 37°C. Normal human astrocytes were
purchased from Lonza and cultured per manufacturer's guidelines. GBM39, GBM6, HK301,
GSC11, and GSC23 were cultured in Neurocult media (Stemcell Technologies)
supplemented with EGF (Sigma), FGF (Sigma) and heparin (Sigma) in a humidified 5%
CO2 incubator at 37°C.

Tissue Microarray
Tissue microarrays (TMA) were constructed as reported previously (Guo et al., 2009), and
immunohistochemical staining was performed, as described under immunohistochemistry
methods, to analyze the expression of LDLR in 55 GBM samples and 24 normal brain
samples. All of the tumor samples included in the GBM tissue microarray were obtained and
approved under the UCLA IRB# 10-000655 (formerly known as UCLA IRB# 99-07-061).
Patients who were alive at the time that the TMA was constructed, provided written consent.

Patients who had expired by that time, were exempt from this requirement, in accordance
with the UCLA IRB policies. Images of LDLR-stained tissue sections were reviewed in a
blinded fashion and dichotomized as either undetectable or barely detectable – “low”, or as
readily detectable or abundant – “high”.
TCGA Data Analysis

Author Manuscript

Processed TCGA data were downloaded through the TCGA data portal. The EGFR status of
TCGA GBM samples are designated as euploid, regionally amplified, focally amplified, or
EGFRvIII based on annotations previously published (Brennan et al., 2013). Specifically,
EGFRvIII samples are samples with non-zero Δ2–7 values, and euploid / regionally
amplified / focally amplified samples are non-EGFRvIII samples labeled as “Euploid” /
“Regional gain” / “Focal Amplification.” The EGFR status of TCGA LUAD samples are
designated as “EGFR Euploid” or “EGFR Amplification” based on annotations previously
published (Lawrence et al., 2014).
Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Plasma and brain concentrations of LXR-623 (0.5% methylcellulose, 2% Tween-80 in
water) in female nu/nu mice after oral dosing (day 1 and 7) were determined by standard
LC-MS/MS-based methods by WuXi AppTec (Shanghai, China).
Intracranial Xenograft

Author Manuscript

Five week old female athymic nu/nu mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley Inc.
1 × 105 U87EGFRvIII iRFP720 or GBM39 IRFP720 cells in 5 μl of phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) were intracranially injected into the mouse brain as described previously
(Ozawa and James, 2010). Tumors were allowed to establish over the course of 7-10 days
and engraftment of tumors was quantitatively confirmed via fluorescence molecular
tomography (FMT) signal intensity. Tumor growth was monitored using an FMT 2500
Fluorescence Tomography System (PerkinElmer). For drug treatment studies, vehicle (0.5%
methylcellulose, 2% Tween-80 in water) or LXR-623 (400 mg/kg) resuspended in vehicle
were administered to mice via oral gavage daily starting at day seven post-injection. All
procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care
Committee at University of California, San Diego.
Data Analysis

Author Manuscript

The Fischer's exact test was used for statistical analysis of tissue microarray staining. The
Mantel-Cox log-rank and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests were used for statistical
comparisons in survival analyses. All other statistical comparisons were carried out using
Student's t tests. Throughout all figures, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001, N.S. = not
significant. Significance was concluded at p < 0.05.

Significance
Adult brain cancers are almost universally fatal in part because of the physicochemical
segregation and biochemical composition of the central nervous system (CNS). We
exploit these unique features by showing glioblastoma (GBM) cells suppress cholesterol
and liver X receptor (LXR) ligand synthesis, making them dependent on CNS-derived
cholesterol for survival. This pathophysiological property renders GBMs highly
vulnerable to a brain penetrant LXR agonist, thus illuminating a pharmacologically
viable means to kill GBMs, and possibly brain metastases.
