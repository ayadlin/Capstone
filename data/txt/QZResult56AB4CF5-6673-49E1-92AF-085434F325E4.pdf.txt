ABSTRACT
The identification of hot spots, a small subset of protein interfaces that accounts
for the majority of binding free energy, is becoming more important for the research
of drug design and cancer development. Based on our previous methods (APIS and
KFC2), here we proposed a novel hot spot prediction method. For each hot spot residue,
we firstly constructed a wide variety of 108 sequence, structural, and neighborhood
features to characterize potential hot spot residues, including conventional ones and
new one (pseudo hydrophobicity) exploited in this study. We then selected 3 topranking features that contribute the most in the classification by a two-step feature
selection process consisting of minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance algorithm
and an exhaustive search method. We used support vector machines to build our
final prediction model. When testing our model on an independent test set, our
method showed the highest F1-score of 0.70 and MCC of 0.46 comparing with the
existing state-of-the-art hot spot prediction methods. Our results indicate that these
features are more effective than the conventional features considered previously,
and that the combination of our and traditional features may support the creation of
a discriminative feature set for efficient prediction of hot spots in protein interfaces.

INTRODUCTION

which means that systematically studying the roles of
mutations in protein interfaces, including hot spots, can
help us to identify cancer driver genes. For example,
Porta-Pardo et al. [4] have explored the role of missense
mutations on PPI interfaces as cancer driver mutations in
a pan-cancer cohort of 5,989 tumors from 23 projects of
The Cancer Genome Atlas. Their analysis identified PPI
interfaces enriched in somatic mutations in a total of 103
genes, proving that alteration of interaction interfaces is a
common pathogenic mechanism of cancer mutations.
Experimentally, hot spots can be detected using
molecular biology and thermodynamic methods upon sitedirected mutagenesis like alanine scanning, which aims

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a critical
role in nearly all aspects of cellular functions like DNA
replication and signal transduction [1, 2]. Studies of
principles governing PPIs have revealed that most of the
binding free energy in an interaction is contributed by a
small fraction of interface residues known as hot spots [3].
Identifying these hot spot residues in protein interfaces can
help us better understand protein binding mechanisms and
may also help us to modulate protein-protein association.
In addition, it has been suggested that mutations in protein
interfaces play a key roles in cancer development [4],

to evaluate the change in the binding free energy resulting
from the mutations of protein residues to alanine within a
protein interface. A database collecting a list of hot spots
identified by alanine scanning mutagenesis experiments is
Alanine Scanning Energetics Database (ASEdb) [5]. Binding
Interface Database (BID) is another database which contains
experimentally verified hot spots from literature studies [6].
The characteristics of hot spots have been
extensively studied. Sequential and structural analysis of
the protein-protein interface has indicated that hot spots
are more conserved than non-hot spot residues [7, 8]. Also,
it reveals that hot spots are usually tightly packed within
the interface and surrounded by a ring of energetically less
important residues that occlude bulk solvent from the hot
spots [9]. Other features are also found to be correlated
with hot spots, including pairing potential [10] and
protrusion index [11].
Because identification of hot spots by experimental
methods like alanine scanning mutagenesis is timeconsuming, labor-intensive and expensive, there is a need
for developing reliable computational methods to identify
hot spots. In recent years, a number of computational
methods have been proposed which exploit one or more
properties of hot spots, as described above, to detect them
from protein interfaces. Some of these methods are based
on molecular dynamics simulation techniques [12–14]
while others are based on different energy functions
such as Robetta [15] and FOLDEF [16]. Recently, there
has been considerable progress in applying machine
learning approaches to discriminate hot spots from the
rest of the interface residues such as decision trees [17],
neural network [18], support vector machine [19], random
forests, and extreme learning machine. We also have
developed two hot spot prediction approaches based on
support vector machine, i.e. APIS [11] and KFC2 [20],
which have both clearly improved predictive ability. These
machine learning methods try to predict hot spots by using
sequence, structure or a combination of both sequence and
structure information. Most of these approaches are trained
on a subset of ASEdb and tested independently on another
dataset obtained from BID. Overall, these computational
approaches, especially machine learning methods,
have become a valuable complement to experimental
approaches and can reduce the number of mutations that
experimental researchers have to pursue when attempting
to establish principles about binding mechanisms.
In this paper, we proposed a novel hot spot
prediction method, HEP, which based on our previous
APIS and KFC2 approaches. First, we constructed a wide
variety of 108 sequence, structural, and neighborhood
features to characterize potential hot spot residues,
including conventional ones and new ones exploited in this
study. Then, we used a two-step feature selection method
to identify the best top-ranking features that contribute
the most in the classification. Finally, we built a model
(HEP) using support vector machine (SVM) and evaluated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the performance of the proposed HEP model on two
benchmark datasets, ASEdb and BID. The results show
that the proposed method was able to outperform existing
hot spot prediction methods. The basic architecture of the
proposed model HEP is shown in (Figure 1).

RESULTS
Feature selection and predictive ability
Features for machine learning methods is an
important factor in building a model. In this work,
we investigated physicochemical, structural, and
neighborhood features for identifying hot spot (shown in
Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Additional features
[11] derived from residue-residue pairing preferences
at the interface, residue conversation and temperature
factor are also considered in HEP. The physicochemical
features consist of a total of 17 attributes, where PSHP
(pseudo hydrophobicity) is a novel feature for hot spot
identification. The structural features include accessible
surface area (ASA), relative ASA (RASA), depth index
(DI), protrusion index (PI) [11], and the residue’s position
information within the protein interface [20]. Because
the environment of a target interface residue can affect
its importance to the protein interaction, we defined 33
features related to neighbors of the target residue, which
were used in our KFC2 hot spot model [20] and DBSI
DNA-binding site model [21]. In total, we identified 4
groups of features, which consist set of 108 feature vectors
for each hot spot. More details about the feature encoding
schema can be found in features representation under
Materials and Methods section.
To assess the feature importance of the 108 features
in predicting hot spots, we applied a two-step feature
selection method on ASEdb Dataset. In the first step,
we used minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance
(mRMR) [22, 23], a well-designed filter method, to
assess the feature vector elements in each feature
group (physicochemical features, structural features,
neighborhood features, and features derived from residueresidue pairing preferences at the interface, residue
conversation and temperature factor). The top 1/3 features
from different groups were selected. The total number of
features we got is 36. Table 1 gives the information of
the composition of each feature group and the number
of features that were selected.
In the second step, we used a similar wrapper
method in our previous work. We first considered
2 different features combinations. Then we added one
feature to train our models with SVM each time. This
was an effective way to decrease the combinational
complexity of feature sampling while creating models
with diverse feature combinations. According to the
models trained using different feature combinations,
18066

we found that the following three features achieved the
best model among those we examined: electron-ion
interaction pseudopotential (EIIP), pseudo hydrophobicity
(PSHP), and relative change in total mean PI upon binding
(RctmPI). Many more features and combinations were
tried, but no better models were obtained. For details of
feature representation and selection, please see features
representation and two-step features selection under
Materials and Methods section.
After identifying the best feature combination, we
wanted to optimize the corresponding parameters for
SVM. The LIBSVM package [24] was employed in this
work. The Gaussian Radial Basis Function kernel was
exclusively used in the computations based on previous
studies. The capacity parameter C (0.0–80.0) and the
kernel parameter G (0.0–2.0) of the SVMs were tried
using a grid search method for Gaussian RBF kernel
functions. The cross-validation produced the best results
using parameter values C = 80.0 and G = 0.002. These
parameters were then used to train the final HEP model
on the entire training set (ASEdb), on which a 10-fold
cross-validation was performed to assess predictive
performance.
The performance of our model is measured by six
metrics: accuracy (ACC), specificity (SPE), precision
(PRE), recall (REC), MCC and F1 score. F1-score is
the harmonic mean of the precision and recall, which is

widely used to handle unbalanced data such as hot spot
data. Table 2 illustrates the results of cross-validations.
HEP achieved Accuracy  =  0.73, Specificity  =  0.70,
Precision =  0.63, Recall  =  0.77, F1  =  0.70, and
MCC = 0.46. We can see that compared with HEP model,
F1 score is quite low when we use all 108 features
without feature selection. After feature selection, we
got 3 significant features. We predict 48 of the hot spots
correctly with 28 false positives. On the other hand, 64
of the non-hot spots are correctly classified with 14 false
negatives.
We have further tested the effect of deleting one
feature from the 3 features (EIIP, PSHP, and RctmPI). We
observe that the specificity and precision increases but the
recall decreases when the feature EIIP was removed. In
other words, fewer positive hot spot residue are predicted
with higher percentage of true cases. Compared with
HEP model, a slight decrease in F1-score performance
from 0.70  to 0.69 is observed when the feature PSHP
was removed. Further, when the feature RctmPI was
eliminated, both the precision and recall decrease, with
the F1-score of only 0.48. The results indicate that the
performance based on 2 features (maximum F1 = 0.69)
was lower than HEP model based on the three features
EIIP, PSHP, and RctmPI. Therefore, we used these three
features based classifiers as our final model to infer hot
spot residues in protein interfaces.

Performance comparisons with other prediction
methods

MET150: A and TRP13: C) as hot spots and the rest as
non-hot spots. Three of the four hot spots were correctly
predicted. In contrast, APIS predicted only one residue
(TRP13: C) as hot spot and the others as non-hot spots.

We have been careful in making comparisons
between models, and we have provided exhaustive
information to facilitate future comparisons with the
HEP model on the independent test dataset. The detailed
measures of these different predictors are listed in Table 3.
We can see that our method substantially outperforms the
existing methods in four performance metrics (accuracy,
recall, F1 score and MCC). We have the highest REC,
which means our method can predict more hot spots than
the others. Furthermore, the F1-score of our method is
0.70, while those of the existing methods fall in the range
of 0.34–0.64. Comparing with APIS and KFC2, we find
our performance has a high improvement. The predictive
results for the independent test also indicate that the
proposed model performs significantly better than the
existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Complex between the beta-catenin and
adenomatous polyposis protein
The beta-catenin (PDBID: 1jpp, chain B) binds
to adenomatous polyposis protein (PDBID: 1jpp,
chain D). Experimentally identified hot spots residues
at 1jppBD interface are LYS345: B and TRP383: B
(indicated in Figure 3). Furthermore, LYS354: B,
ARG386: B, LYS435:  B, ARG469: B and HIS470:
B were experimentally determined to be non-hot spots.
Our method correctly predicted one out of the two hot spot
residues, that is, TRP383: B, and all the non-hot spots.
As a comparison, APIS correctly predicted all the non-hot
spots but none hot spots.

DISCUSSION

Complex between the erythropoietin receptor
and erythropoietin mimetic peptide

In this study, we computed 108 different features
including physicochemical features, structural features
and other conventional features. We used a two-step
feature selection method to choose significant features.
The importance of features provides insights for their
discrimination abilities between hot spots and non-hot
spots. In order to show different ability of the three features
for distinguishing hot spots from non-hot spots, statistical
analysis method Mann-Whitney U test (the confidence level
is 0.95) is performed. The differences of the three features

MET150: A and TRP13: C, indicated in (Figure 2)) and
five non-hot spots have been experimentally determined
in the 1ebpAC interface. In these 9 alanine-mutated
residues, our method identified three residues (PHE93: A,

between hot spots and non-hot spots are significant shown
in (Figure 4). And Table 4 gives the median value and
P-value of hot spots and non-hot spots for these 3 features.
(Figure 4A) shows the box plot of EIIP between hot
spots and non-hot spots in the training set. The median
value of EIIP of hot spots and non-hot spots is 0.0646 and
0.1442, respectively with a P-value of 0.714 (Table 4).
According to the P-value, EIIP may not be a good feature
to distinguish hot spots from non-hot spots by itself.
However, in Nguyen et al [25]. They use frequency-related
features involved physicochemical characteristic such as
electron-ion interaction potentials and ionization constants
to predict hot spots and get a high F1. Their results brought
evidence to support the conjecture of Cosic et al. [26]. That
protein hot spots are associated with frequency features of
physicochemical characteristics of the amino acid sequence.
Meanwhile, we tested the result without the feature using the
same method and got the best F1 of 0.52 and the best recall
of 0.61, which were far from our performance. It means that
EIIP is an important feature even that it has not good ability
to discriminate hot spots and non-hot spots when used alone.

(Figure 4B) is the box plot of RctmPI, in which the
median value of RctmPI of hot spots (0.9237) is higher
than that of non-hot spots (0.6442). In addition, the
P-value is 0 (Table 4). These results suggest the hot spots
residues prefer to protrude from the surface, which are
in accordance with the results obtained from Pintar et al
[27]. and Wu et al [28]. So the feature RctmPI is a useful
feature to construct the SVM model. In our previous work
[11], we used individual feature to construct models and
also found the individual-feature model with RctmPI has
more prediction power.
(Figure 4C) represents the box plot of PSHP of hot
spots and non-hot spots. The median PSHP of hot spots is
0.77 and that of non-hot spots is -0.04 (P-value = 0.009,
Table 4). Thus, PSHP is also an important feature for
distinguishing hot spots from non-hot spots. To consider
the relationship among PSHP, residue hydrophobicity
(HP), and residue hydrophobicity multiplying charges
(CHP), we tested our results by using them respectively
with the other two features (EIIP and RctmPI). We also
plotted their box plots as that showed in (Supplementary

Figure 3: Interaction between the beta-catenin (PDBID: 1jpp, chain B, coloured by green) and adenomatous polyposis
protein (PDBID: 1jpp, chain D, coloured by magenta). The defined hot spot residues are LYS345: B and TRP383: B (represented
by VDW spheres) in the 1jppBD interface. TRP383: B (coloured by red) is the hot spot that was correctly predicted by our method.

Figure  S1). CHP is defined as the hydrophobicity
multiplied by -1 when the residue is ASP, GLU, LYS or
ARG and the hydrophobicity when the residue is other
type, which is a little different from that defined in PSHP.
(Supplementary Figure S1B) shows the box plot of HP of
hot spots and non-hot spots. The median HP of hot spots
is –0.61 and that of non-hot spots is –0.04, with a P-value
of 0.728, respectively. (Supplementary Figure S1C) is the
box plot of CHP with a median value 0.96 for hot spots
and 0.26 for non-hot spots (P-value = 0). The charged
residues, ASP, GLU, LYS and ARG, can often be hot spots
when they are in the interface, because they formed strong
hydrogen bond or salt bridges with other residues. We
multiplied the hydrophobicity scales of these residues by -1
to make the correspondence between these residues with
other hydrophobic residues (TRP, PHE) that are often
hot spots in the interface. However, it turned out LYS
and ARG in the interface could have been well described
by other two features. We owe it to that the side chains
of ASP and GLU are long but not too long compared to
LYS and ARG, so that when they are in the interface the
entropy loss can be complementary by the strong hydrogen

bond or salt bridges formed by them with other residues.
(Figure 4D–4F) also shows the box plots of hot spots and
non-hot spots in the test data set.
In conclusion, hot spot residues comprise a small
fraction of the interface residues that make a dominant
contribution to the free energy of the binding. Owing to
the time consumption and labor intensity in experiment
determination of binding free energy for alanine-mutated
residues, computational methods can thus be helpful
in suggesting residues for possible experimentation. In
this study, we proposed a new computational method to
identify hot spots in the protein interfaces. We extracted
108 various features from different aspects such as
physicochemical, structure, atom contact from APIS and
KFC2. Then we used a two-step feature selection approach
that can significantly improve the prediction performance
and reduce the risk of over-fitting. Firstly, we used mRMR
to select a number of features from different feature
groups, which can facilitate the integration of other feature
selection methods to select a compact subset of superior
features within a very low cost. Secondly, we tried to use
the least number of features to construct our model and we

selected only three features at last when we tried different
feature combinations. Test results on independent data set
indicated that our method is more effective than the major
existing hot spot prediction methods. Researchers who
are interested in finding new features of hot spot residues
could use the HEP model to characterize the roles of their
features. HEP would also benefit from these new features
on the other hand.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A wide variety of 108 physicochemical, structural
and neighbor features are used to characterize potential
hot spot residues. In our study, we combined the features
used in APIS [11] and KFC2 [20]. Meanwhile, we added
a number of features proposed in DBSI [21] in this study.
These features can be roughly divided into four groups: (I)
Physicochemical features; (II) structural Features related
to solvent accessibility; (III) features related to neighbors
of the target residue; and (IV) other features.

Datasets

Physicochemical features

Two benchmark hot spot datasets are used in this
work. Following our previous work [11], we used the
ASEdb dataset [5] and the published data of Kortemme
and Baker [15] as the training set. An interface residue
in the dataset corresponding to a binding free energy
higher or equal to 2.0 kcal/mol is defined as a hot spot
residue. The interface residues with binding free energy
less than 0.4 kcal/mol is considered as non-hot spot. Other
interface residues with binding free energy between 0.4
and 2.0 are excluded from the training set for the purpose
of increasing discrimination between hot spots and nonhot spots. The final training set comprised of 62 hot spots
and 92 non-hot spots.
Similar to our previous work [11], the BID database
[6] was used an as independent test set. In BID, the alanine
mutation data are categorized as “strong”, ”intermediate”,
“weak”, or “insignificant”. In our study, only the residues
labeled as “strong” are considered as hot spots and the
remaining residues are regarded as non-hot spots. As a result,
the final test set contained 127 alanine mutated interface
residues in 18 complexes with 39 hot spots and 88 non-hot
spots. For details of these two datasets, please refer to [11].

Physicochemical features of an amino acid residue
were described by 16 values such as hydrophobicity,
hydrophilicity, isoelectric point, mass, expected number
of contacts with 14 Å sphere, electron-ion interaction
pseudopotential (EIIP). The description of these features
can be found in our previous works [11, 20].
In addition, a new feature called pseudo
hydrophobicity (PSHP) was generated based on the
combination of hydrophobicity and charge. If the charge of
the residue was non-negative, the pseudo hydrophobicity was
defined as the hydrophobicity of the residue; if the charge
of the residue was negative, i.e. Asp or Glu, the pseudo
hydrophobicity was defined as the product of the
hydrophobicity index and the charge of the residue. Here the
negatively charged residues were assigned a charge of -1.

Features extracted from structural attributes
55 structure-based features related to accessible
surface area (ASA), relative ASA (RASA), depth index
(DI), and protrusion index (PI) were used in this study.
These features were calculated using PSAIA [29]. For
details, please refer to our previous works [11, 20].

combined features from different classes to create diverse
feature combination sets.

The environment of a target interface residue is very
important because hot spots were found to be clustered
within tightly packed regions. We defined environmental
features of a target residue with two distances cutoffs
4.0 and 5.0 Å. The number of residues and the number
of atoms around the side chain of the target residue were
calculated within this environment, respectively. We also
calculated the number of rotatable single bonds within the
side chain. In addition, the weighted rotatable single bond
number, which is the number of rotatable single bonds
divided by the number of atoms in the side chain, was also
calculated. Lastly, we calculated the total hydrophobicity
of residues around the side chain of the target residue, with
the purpose of reflecting the environmental hydrophobicity
of the target residues.

Classification method
The classification model for predicting hot spots was
based on SVM, which is a class of effective supervised
learning methods that demonstrate high prediction
accuracy while efficiently avoiding the overfitting
problem. The LIBSVM package (Chang and Lin 2001)
was employed in this work. The Gaussian Radial Basis
Function kernel was exclusively used in the computations
based on previous studies. We tried different C factors
(ranging from 0 to 80) and different G factors (ranging
from 0 to 2) for Gaussian RBF kernel functions. The value
of C controls the trade-off between allowing training errors
and forcing strict margins, while the value of G determines
the Gaussian RBF width. Depending on the composition
of the data set and the number of features used, the optimal
values for C and G can vary tremendously.

Other features
B-factor was used to represent the flexibility of
amino acid residue. Secondary structure of each residue
collected from DSSP [30] was also used to describe
hot spots. We also computed the pair potential of each
residue in our data set by using the method in Xia at el
[11]. Additionally, the evolution rate for each residue was
obtained using the Rate4Site algorithm [31], which was
implemented in the ConSurf-DB [32] server.
Totally, 108 descriptors were generated for each
interface residue (For details, please see Supplementary
Table S1).

Performance assessment
Predicting a binding site as hot spot or non-hot spot
is a binary classification problem, and many measures have
been introduced for validation issues. Here the prediction
performances are evaluated by the overall prediction
accuracy (ACC), specificity (SPE), precision (PRE), recall
(REC), F1 score, and the Matthew’s correlation coefficient
(MCC). These measures are defined as,
ACC = (TP + TN ) / (TP + FP + TN + FN )

Two-step features selection

SPE = TN / (TN + FP )

Feature selection, more precisely feature subset
selection, is performed to eliminate uninformative
properties to generate robust and general prediction
models. In this work, we propose a two-step feature
selection method, as shown in (Figure 1), to select a subset
of features, with which to obtain better discrimination of
hot spots and non-hot spots.
In the first step, we divided the feature into 4 groups.
Then we assessed the feature elements using minimum
Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) [22, 23]
in each group. mRMR is very useful in the preprocess
of feature selection as described in Peng et al [22].
We applied mRMR to each group and chose the top
1/3 features of group 1, 2, 3, and 4. Table 1 gives the
information of the composition of each group and the
number of features that were selected and non-selected.
After that, we got 36 features.
In our second step, we used the similar method in
our previous work [20]. We first selected 2 features from
the selected 36 features. Then we added one feature each
time until the F1 score and MCC was improved. And
we used support vector machines (SVM) to evaluate

PRE = TP / (TP + FP )

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

REC = TP / (TP + FN )
F 1 = 2 × REC × PRE / ( REC + PRE )
MCC =

(TP × TN − FP × FN )
(TP + FN )(TP + FP )
(TN + FP )(TN + FN )

where TP, FP, TN, and FN are the number of true
positive (correctly predicted hot spot), false positive
(non-hot spot residue incorrectly predicted as hot spot),
true negatives (correctly predicted non-hot spot), and the
number of false negatives (hot spot residue incorrectly
predicted as non-hot spot), respectively.
