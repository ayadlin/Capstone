There is a strong rationale to therapeutically target the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian
target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway in breast
cancer since it is highly deregulated in this disease and it
also mediates resistance to anti-HER2 therapies. However,
initial studies with rapalogs, allosteric inhibitors of
mTORC1, have resulted in limited clinical efﬁcacy probably
due to the release of a negative regulatory feedback loop
that triggers AKT and ERK signaling. Since activation of
AKT occurs via PI3K, we decided to explore whether PI3K
inhibitors prevent the activation of these compensatory
pathways. Using HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells
as a model, we observed that PI3K inhibitors abolished
AKT activation. However, PI3K inhibition resulted in a
compensatory activation of the ERK signaling pathway.
This enhanced ERK signaling occurred as a result of
activation of HER family receptors as evidenced by
induction of HER receptors dimerization and phosphorylation, increased expression of HER3 and binding of adaptor
molecules to HER2 and HER3. The activation of ERK
was prevented with either MEK inhibitors or anti-HER2
monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
Combined administration of PI3K inhibitors with either
HER2 or MEK inhibitors resulted in decreased proliferation, enhanced cell death and superior anti-tumor activity
compared with single agent PI3K inhibitors. Our ﬁndings
indicate that PI3K inhibition in HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer activates a new compensatory pathway that
results in ERK dependency. Combined anti-MEK or antiHER2 therapy with PI3K inhibitors may be required in
order to achieve optimal efﬁcacy in HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer. This approach warrants clinical evaluation.

Introduction
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)—protein
kinase B (PKB/AKT)—mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) axis regulates critical cellular functions including
metabolism, proliferation, size, survival, migration and
angiogenesis (for reviews see Cantley, 2002; Vivanco and
Sawyers, 2002; Guertin and Sabatini, 2007). The PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway is triggered by upstream activation
of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (Yarden and
Sliwkowski, 2001). Once activated, these receptors serve
as a docking site for PI3K binding, either directly through
its regulatory subunit p85 or indirectly via adaptor
molecules (that is insulin receptor substrate 1, IRS1).
The PI3K pathway is frequently hyperactivated in
breast cancer, as well as in other tumor types, by a
number of different mechanisms. First, there is a high
frequency of mutations in genes of the PI3K signaling
cascade. In breast cancer, PIK3CA (encoding p110-a,
the catalytic subunit of PI3K) mutations that occur in
one third of patients are site speciﬁc (located in the
helical and kinase domains) and are more frequent in
tumors expressing hormone receptors and HER2 (Saal
et al., 2005; Kalinsky et al., 2009). Less frequent are
PIK3CA ampliﬁcation and mutations in the AKT gene
(Bellacosa et al., 1995; Carpten et al., 2007; LopezKnowles et al., 2010). Second, loss of function of the
tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog is
also a common event in breast cancer (Li et al., 1997)
and is associated with increased PI3K-pathway activity,
metastasis and poor survival (Saal et al., 2005, 2007;
Stemke-Hale et al., 2008). And third, HER2 overexpression/ampliﬁcation is found in 20% in breast
cancer patients (Slamon et al., 1987) and boosts PI3K
signaling through HER2/HER3 heterodimerization
(Holbro et al., 2003). Taken together, over 70% of

breast cancers have a dysregulated PI3K pathway
(Lopez-Knowles et al., 2010). Aberrant activation of
the PI3K pathway also results in resistance to antiHER2 and other anti-cancer agents (Clark et al., 2002;
Nagata et al., 2004; Berns et al., 2007; Eichhorn et al.,
2008). Hence, there is a strong rationale to therapeutically target the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis in breast cancer.
The ﬁrst available agents for clinical targeting of the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were allosteric mTORC1
inhibitors (rapamycin analogs, also known as rapalogs).
Despite the importance of this pathway in breast cancer,
rapalogs have shown only modest efﬁcacy to date (Chan
et al., 2005; Baselga et al., 2009; Ellard et al., 2009).
A likely explanation for their limited activity may reside
in that mTORC1 inhibition results in the abrogation of
an S6K-IRS1-PI3K negative feedback loop, resulting
in upstream activation of AKT (O’Reilly et al., 2006;
Cloughesy et al., 2008; Tabernero et al., 2008). To
overcome this effect, combinations of mTOR inhibitors
with agents that target proximal pathway elements such
as antibodies against the insulin-like growth factor
receptor 1 (IGF-1R) are currently under study. Another
potential drawback secondary to mTORC1 inhibition is
ERK pathway activation, as evidenced by increased
levels of P-ERK in patient tumor samples (Carracedo
et al., 2008; Cloughesy et al., 2008). This occurs through
the removal of the inhibitory effect of a presumed
S6K-PI3K-RAS feedback loop.
The anti-tumor activity of speciﬁc class I PI3K or
combined PI3K/mTOR inhibitors has been proven in
several preclinical models (Fan et al., 2006; Serra et al.,
2008; Ihle et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2009) and their clinical
efﬁcacy is being evaluated, among other indications, in
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. A potential advantage of PI3K inhibitors over mTORC1 inhibitors would
be the prevention of AKT activation, which may limit
clinical efﬁcacy of the latter group of compounds. With
the intent to study whether PI3K inhibitors prevent this
effect, we have found that, although these inhibitors
prevent AKT activation, they activate the ERK pathway
via an as yet undescribed mechanism, HER2 receptor
activation. In the current study, we have characterized this
mechanism, as well potential strategies to circumvent it.
Our results set the stage for hypothesis-driven combination studies in HER2-positive breast cancer.
Results
Inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR induces ERK
phosphorylation in HER2-overexpressing cells
Previous ﬁndings by our group and others indicate
that PI3K and mTOR blockade may result in activation
of compensatory pathways that could potentially
reduce the anti-tumor effects of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
(O’Reilly et al., 2006; Carracedo et al., 2008; Serra et al.,
2008; Courtney et al., 2010). Since PI3K inhibitors are
currently being investigated in HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer due to their frequently aberrant PI3K
activation status, we decided to investigate further the
presence of compensatory pathways in this tumor type.
Oncogene

To this end, we treated several HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer cell lines with BEZ235, an imidazoquinoline
that inhibits class I PI3K catalytic activity by competing
at its ATP-binding site and that also inhibits mTOR
catalytic activity (Maira et al., 2008). Therapy with
BEZ235 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in ERK
phosphorylation in all studied cells (BT474 and MCF7HER2, Figure 1a; SKBR3, Supplementary Figure 1; and
MDA-MB-361, data not shown). The phosphorylation of
p90RSK, a downstream effector dependent of ERK
signaling, also increased following BEZ235 exposure. In
HER2 negative cell lines such as parental MCF7 the
activation of P-ERK upon PI3K/mTOR inhibition was
less pronounced. In MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231
cells, we could not detect an increase in P-ERK, probably
due to inherent high signaling of P-ERK in these cells
(EGFR overexpressing and K-RAS mutated cells, respectively) (Supplementary Figure 2).
BEZ235 at low concentrations (o100 nM) has a
predominant mTORC1 inhibitory activity whereas at
relatively high concentrations (E500 nM) it is a dual
PI3K/mTORC1/2 inhibitor (Serra et al., 2008). This
concentration-dependent effect of BEZ235 explains the
increased phosphorylation of AKT at both Ser473
and Thr308 seen at lower concentrations of BEZ235
(E25 nM) in cell lines with low basal levels of P-AKT
(MCF7-HER2, Figure 1a; SKBR3, Supplementary
Figure 1; and MDA-MB-361, data not shown). On the
other hand, at higher BEZ235 concentrations (500 nM)
there was complete inhibition of P-AKT (Figure 1a).
The observed inhibition of phosphorylated S6 served as
readout of BEZ235 mTORC1 activity.
To determine whether activation of ERK was a
consequence of pharmacological blockade of the PI3K/
mTORC pathway rather that a speciﬁc effect of
BEZ235, we studied a number of different anti-PI3K/
mTOR agents. ERK activation was observed with all
studied agents including a pan-PI3K inhibitor (GDC0941), a p110-a inhibitor (PIK-90), the already mentioned dual p110/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235, an AKT1/2/
3 allosteric inhibitor (MK-2206), an allosteric mTOR
inhibitor (RAD001) and an mTORC1/2 catalytic
inhibitor (Torin1) (see MCF7-HER2, Figure 1b; and
BT474, data not shown). Although the increase in ERK
phosphorylation by mTORC1 allosteric inhibitors has
been associated with active PI3K (Carracedo et al.,
2008), we observed a measurable increase in HER2
phoshorylation, which suggests co-existence of two
mechanisms.
In an attempt to dissect the potential source of HER2
phosphorylation, we observed that AKT is inhibited by
all the compounds with the exception of RAD001, an
allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1, for which the increase
of P-AKT was expected (O’Reilly et al., 2006). Regarding the different patterns of inhibition of S6 phosphorylation, we observed that the inhibitors of the upper
pathway (the PI3K inhibitors GDC-0941 and PIK-90,
and the allosteric AKT1/2/3 inhibitor) partly inhibit
mTORC1 activity and therefore only a modest decrease
of P-S6 is observed (similar data for P-4EBP1, not
shown). On the other hand, inhibitors that act further

downstream in the pathway and target directly
mTORC1 (BEZ235, RAD001, Torin1) are more efﬁcient in decreasing the levels of P-S6 (and P-4EBP1, not
shown). Therefore, the common pattern across all
inhibitors and potential source of HER2 phosphorylation was AKT blockade (with the exception of RAD001
as already mentioned).
The observed ERK activation with multiple agents
suggests a class-effect. To rule out pharmacological
off target effects of these compounds, we knocked
down the expression of p110-a by means of siRNA and
observed increase phosphorylated HER2, HER3 and
ERK (Figure 1c). The knockdown of Akt1/2/3 reproduced similar results (data not shown). Activation of
ERK as well as a decrease in P-S6 following BEZ235
treatment was observed also in vivo in human tumor
xenografts (BT474-Tr, Figure 1d and Supplementary
Figure 3a; BT474 and MDA-MB-361, data not shown)
and in mouse skin (Supplementary Figure 3b). It is
worth noting that activation of ERK is not an
immediate event and that it was detected only 6 h after
compound administration in our in vivo experiments
(Supplementary Figure 3a). This delay in activation was
also observed in vitro (data not shown) and could have
implications for when to monitor ERK activation in
clinical trials.
PI3K/mTOR inhibition induces HER receptor activation
Since in other model systems we had previously shown
that activation of compensatory pathways with
mTORC1 inhibitors occurred via activation of the

RTK IGF-1R signaling (Shi et al., 2005; O’Reilly
et al., 2006), we decided to investigate whether increased
ERK phosphorylation following PI3K/mTOR inhibition in HER2-positive cells was also accompanied by
activation of RTKs.
We used a phospho-RTK array to study the effects of
BEZ235 administration on the activation status of 42
RTKs, including HER receptors, IGF-1R, MET and
PDGFR. The main ﬁnding of this experiment was a
pronounced increase in phosphorylation of members of
the HER family. With longer exposure of the phosphoRTK array, activation of other receptors (IGF-1R,
EphA7) was detected, albeit only very modestly (data
not shown). In BT474 cells, there was an increase of both
P-HER2 and P-HER3 (Figures 2a and b). These results
were conﬁrmed in MCF7-HER2 cells (Figure 2b) in
which we also detected an increased EGFR phosphorylation. The PI3K inhibitor-mediated activation of HER
receptors was prevented by the anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) lapatinib. Beside HER receptor activation, we also detected an increase of total HER3 (more
marked in BT474 cells) and total EGFR (more marked in
MCF7-HER2 cells) levels in cells treated with BEZ235
alone or in combination with lapatinib (see Figure 2b).
This increase in HER3 protein was associated with
enhanced transcription of mRNA for this receptor
(Figure 2c), suggesting that PI3K negatively regulates
receptor expression and that this negative feedback is
released with PI3K inhibition (Makhija et al., 2010).
To a lesser extent, HER2 transcription also increased
in the same conditions. No signiﬁcant differences (we

were found in BT474 cells treated with BEZ235
(Figure 2c). Because FoxO transcription factors can
modulate the expression of HER3 (Garrett et al., 2009;
Chandarlapaty et al., 2011), we conﬁrmed that PI3K,
AKT and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors enhanced FoxO3a
nuclear localization along with an increase of HER3
protein (Supplementary Figure 4a and b and Chandarlapaty et al., 2011).
PI3K inhibition induces HER2/3 receptor dimerization
and increases binding of the adaptor GRB2 to HER2
and the p85 subunit of PI3K to HER3
We attempted next to dissect the mechanism responsible
for HER receptors activation and consequent ERK
phosphorylation following PI3K/mTOR inhibition.
Increased HER2/HER3 dimer formation was observed
upon BEZ235 treatment as shown by cross-linking of
membrane proteins followed by immunoprecipitation
with an anti-HER2 antibody (Figure 3a). This effect was
not exclusive for HER2/HER3 dimers since we could
also detect increased HER2/EGFR dimer formation in
SKBR3 cells, which express more EGFR compared with
BT474 cells (data not shown). However, in cells with low
levels of EGFR such as MCF7-HER2 cells, we could
not detect membrane EGFR dimerization to HER2 or
HER3 following treatment with BEZ235 (Supplementary Figure 5a).
HER receptor dimerization initiates downstream
signaling via recruitment of both adaptor molecules
and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (Olayioye et al.,
2000; Citri and Yarden, 2006; Baselga and Swain, 2009).
Accordingly, in our experimental model we observed an
Oncogene

increased binding of the adaptor molecule GRB2
and p85 to the HER receptors, responsible for ERK
and AKT activation, respectively. There was a dosedependent increase in the binding between HER2 and
GRB2 in MCF-7HER2 cells treated with BEZ235
(Figure 3b, upper panel). The same result was reproduced in BT474 and SKBR3 cells (data not shown).
Similarly, we observed enhanced binding between
HER3 and p85 upon BEZ235 treatment (Figure 3b,
lower panel). Importantly, the increase of HER2/GRB2
and HER3/p85 binding was prevented by the HER2
TKI lapatinib (Figure 3b). We could not detect an
increase in binding between EGFR and GRB2, ruling
out a possible contribution of increased P-EGFR to
P-ERK in this model (Supplementary Figure 5b).
ERK activation is prevented by HER2 and MEK1/2
inhibitors
In order to conﬁrm that ERK activation following
PI3K/mTOR inhibition occurs via HER receptor
activation, we treated both BT474 and MCF7-HER2
cells with the HER2 TKI lapatinib and the anti-HER2
monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Figures 4a and b).
Both agents inhibited ERK activation, with a greater
inhibition by lapatinib, a more potent receptor signaling
inhibitor than trastuzumab (Scaltriti et al., 2009).
An alternative strategy to block ERK phosphorylation is to use MEK inhibitors, given that MEK is
immediately upstream from ERK. The MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 completely abolished the BEZ235induced phosphorylation of ERK (Figure 4c). As
previously described (Mirzoeva et al., 2009), MEK1/2
inhibition results in AKT phosphorylation. Similar
results were obtained using SKBR3 cells treated with

All protein lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.

BEZ235 combined with lapatinib, trastuzumab or
AZD6244 (data not shown). To rule out a possible
contribution of activated EGFR, we assessed whether
erlotinib, a TKI with selectivity for EGFR (Figure 4d),
could prevent the BEZ235-induced increase of P-ERK.
At 500 nM, erlotinib markedly reduced P-EGFR without
affecting BEZ235-dependent P-ERK activation.
Although we did not detect a signiﬁcant increased
activation of other RTKs with BEZ235 administration
(see above), we wanted to further exclude the possibility
that other receptors (besides the HER family) were
involved in this process. We tested whether the IGF-1R
inhibitor AEW541 and the SRC-kinase inhibitor-I

(SRC-KI-I) could prevent ERK transactivation. These
two tyrosine kinases have been previously described to
have a role in the activation of AKT and ERK by
rapalogs (O’Reilly et al., 2006; Chaturvedi et al., 2009).
We found that they did not prevent ERK activation
following treatment with BEZ235 (Supplementary
Figure 6). As a positive control, we used UO126, an
additional MEK1/2 inhibitor that, in a similar manner
as AZD6244, also showed complete inhibition of ERK.
Importantly, HER2 phosphorylation was not affected
by MEK inhibition further corroborating that RTKs
activation occurs independent from ERK activation
(Supplementary Figure 6).

HER2 blockade potentiates anti-proliferative and
pro-apoptotic effects of PI3K/mTOR inhibition
The compensatory activation of HER receptors and the
ERK pathway could serve as an escape mechanism to
PI3K blockade and diminish the anti-proliferative and proapoptotic potential of PI3K inhibitors. For this reason, we
asked whether dual blockade of HER2 (or MEK1/2) and
PI3K/mTOR would be superior to single inhibition of
PI3K/mTOR in reducing cell proliferation and/or promoting cell death. We found that the combination of BEZ235
with lapatinib, trastuzumab or AZD6244 was more
effective than single agents in reducing cell proliferation
(Figure 5a). Similar results were obtained at higher doses of
BEZ235 (500 nM, targeting both PI3K/mTOR) and shorter
time points (5 days, data not shown). We also observed
that the same combinations of agents enhanced the
apoptosis induced by BEZ235 alone (Figure 5b and data
not shown). Of all the evaluated combinations, BEZ235
with lapatinib showed the highest anti-proliferative and
pro-apoptotic activity.
HER2 or MEK1/2 inhibition potentiates the in vivo
BEZ235 anti-tumor activity
We then measured the activity of anti-HER2 therapy
or MEK1/2 inhibition in combination with BEZ235
in reducing tumor growth of BT474-Tr xenografts.
We ﬁrst attempted the combination of BEZ235 and
lapatinib but, even at suboptimal doses and with wide
intervals of administration of the two compounds
(morning BEZ235/afternoon lapatinib), it resulted in

unacceptable toxicity (body weight loss >10%, dehydration, lethargy) in two different mouse strains
(Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu and Crl:NU-Foxn1nu) on a
continuous dose regime. Whether this implies that the
combination will result in excessive toxicity in humans is
unknown but our ﬁndings should serve as a cautionary
note. The combination of BEZ235 and trastuzumab was
non-toxic and resulted in a signiﬁcantly improved tumor
growth inhibition compared with either agent alone
(Figure 6a, left panel).
Using the same BT474-Tr model, we determined the
anti-tumor activity of the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244
in combination with BEZ235. As previously described,
MEK1/2 inhibition alone has little anti-tumor activity in
BT474-derived tumors (Solit et al., 2006; Hoeﬂich et al.,
2009). However, AZD6244 in combination with
BEZ235 resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of tumor
growth compared with either agent used as monotherapy (Figure 6a, right panel). This increased anti-tumor
activity was accompanied by a decreased in vivo
proliferation as measured by reduced Ki67 staining
(Supplementary Figure 7).
In vivo pharmacodynamic assessment of ERK phosphorylation showed that trastuzumab, lapatinib and
AZD6244 all prevented BEZ235-induced ERK phosphorylation, abeit with differing potencies (Figures 6b
and c). As single agents, lapatinib, AZD6244 and
trastuzumab reduced the levels of P-ERK when
compared with control xenografts whereas P-S6 expression (a read out of PI3K/mTOR inhibition) was

Discussion
In the present study, we have shown that, in HER2positive breast cancer models, the inhibition of the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway results in a compensatory activation
of the ERK signaling pathway. This enhanced ERK
signaling occurs as a result of activation of HER family
receptors as evidenced by increased expression of HER3,
induction of HER receptors dimerization and phosphorylation and binding of adaptor molecules to HER2 and
HER3. Enhanced HER3 protein was observed independently of HER2 overexpression and is due to transcriptional regulation via FoxO transcription factors (Figure 6d;
Garrett et al., 2009; Chandarlapaty et al., 2011), which
are activated upon AKT-mediated nuclear relocalization (Brunet et al., 1999). Allosteric inhibition of
mTORC1 lead to a milder increase in HER2 and
HER3 phosphorylation compared with the other PI3Kpathway inhibitors, which was uncoupled to an increase
in total HER3 protein and FoxO3a nuclear translocation (data not shown). This may indicate that P-ERK
activation following mTORC1 inhibition occurs mainly
via the PI3K-RAS signaling (Carracedo et al., 2008).
Further evidence that enhanced HER2 signaling is
responsible for the observed ERK activation is provided
by the observation that HER2 inhibitors prevented
ERK activation. On the contrary, small molecule kinase
inhibitors of EGFR, IGF-1R or SRC failed to reverse
ERK activation secondary to BEZ235 treatment. Taken
together, our ﬁndings suggest that PI3K inhibition in
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer results in hyperactivation of ERK that could potentially result in
decreased efﬁcacy of PI3K inhibitors. Anti-HER2 and
MEK inhibitors did not only abolish ERK phosphorylation but also increased the anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects of PI3K inhibitors. As a result of
our observations, we would propose that a preferred
therapeutic strategy in HER2-overexpressing breast
cancer would be the administration of PI3K inhibitors
in combination with either anti-HER2 agents or MEK
inhibitors, instead of PI3K inhibitors given alone.
Our ﬁndings provide additional evidence that in
cancer cells with constitutive PI3K activation, negative
regulatory feedback loops silence compensatory pathways (that is RAS/RAF/ERK) and maintain the
dependency on PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, a deﬁning
feature of oncogene addiction. However, upon pathway
(or oncogene) blockade, these inhibitory loops are
released and compensatory pathways are activated. We
are also learning that these compensatory feedback
loops are present at multiple levels of the pathway.
Subsequently, different pathways may awake from a
‘dormant state’ depending on the level at which the
therapeutic intervention occurs. For example, we
initially reported that mTORC1 inhibition results in
Oncogene

activation of PI3K that resulted in ERK activation
(Carracedo et al., 2008). Here, we show that with direct
PI3K blockade another mechanism comes to play, such
as ERK activation via RTKs. While activation of RTKs
also occurs with mTORC1 allosteric inhibitors, it is less
prominent than with PI3K inhibitors. The type of RTK
being activated may also vary in a tumor-dependent
context since we have previously shown activation of
IGF-1R signaling with mTORC1 inhibitors in nonHER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells (O’Reilly et al.,
2006; Tabernero et al., 2008). In contrast, in HER2overexpressing cancer cells, HER receptors signaling
appears to be responsible for ERK activation. Our
ﬁndings have implications for future therapeutic strategies, where the selection of drug combinations will
depend on both the type of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor
as well as the cancer type. For example, based on the
increase of IGF-1R signaling observed with the
mTORC1 inhibitors, we are now conducting a clinical
trial combining an mTORC1 inhibitor with a monoclonal antibody that inhibits IGF-1R signaling in nonHER2-overexpressing breast cancer. This combination
would be less appealing in HER2-positive breast cancers
treated with a PI3K inhibitor.
Our study also highlights the role of the RAS/RAF/
MEK/ERK pathway as an escape mechanism to PI3K
blockade. The ERK cascade is at the heart of signaling
networks that govern proliferation, differentiation and
cell survival (Kolch, 2000). RAS is activated by RTKs
via the adaptor molecule GRB2 and subsequently
signals through RAF, RALGDS or PI3K itself. This
pathway is frequently activated in human tumors, often
through gain-of-function mutations of the RAS and
RAF family members (Davies et al., 2002). Tumors with
mutated BRAF, such as melanoma, are exquisitely
sensitive to selective V600-BRAF and MEK inhibitors
(Solit et al., 2006; Flaherty et al., 2009). Mutations in
this pathway may lead to therapeutic resistance to PI3K
inhibitors that is reverted by MEK inhibitors. For
example, mouse models of mutated KRAS lung cancer
are resistant to BEZ235, but combining BEZ235 with an
MEK inhibitor results in synergistic tumor shrinkage
(Engelman et al., 2008). In breast cancer, BRAF and
RAS mutations are rare, which has supported the use of
PI3K inhibitors as single agents. However, BRAF or
RAS mutations may not be required for resistance to
PI3K inhibitors. For example, resistance to PI3K
inhibitors has been described in a subset of basal-like
breast cancer cells that have a RAS-driven signature
(Hoeﬂich et al., 2009). In the present study of HER2positive breast cancer cells that lack RAS/RAF mutations or a RAS-driven signature, HER2 activation
appears to be a novel mechanism of acquired ‘ERK
dependence’. As in the case of RAS mutant tumors and
tumors with a RAS-driven signature, the addition of an
MEK inhibitor should be beneﬁcial in this setting. Our
studies conﬁrm this since the addition of an MEK
inhibitor (or prevention of pathway activation with antiHER2 agents) to PI3K inhibitors results in greater
inhibition of proliferation, augmented apoptosis and the
signiﬁcant tumor shrinkage observed in vivo.

In conclusion, our data support the use of simultaneous inhibition of PI3K/mTOR and ERK pathways in
HER2-positive breast cancer instead of the administration of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors used as monotherapy.
The inhibition of the ERK pathway can be achieved by
either MEK inhibitors or anti-HER2 agents. Clinical
trials testing the feasibility of combining PI3K inhibitors
with MEK inhibitors are currently being initiated. This
combination could be potentially challenging since these
two classes of agents may have overlapping toxicities
such as skin rash (Shapiro et al., 2009; Banerji et al.,
2010). On the other hand, the combination of mTOR
allosteric inhibitors and trastuzumab has already been
shown to be safe (André et al., 2008) and we have
recently started the enrollment of patients with HER2overexpressing breast cancer in a clinical trial combining
the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 with the anti-HER2
monoclonal antibody trastuzumab.
Materials and methods
Cell lines, treatments and siRNA
All the cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) and maintained in
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle medium/Ham F12 1:1 (DMEM/
F12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM
L-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc. Ltd, Paisley, UK) at 37 1C
in 5% CO2. MCF7-HER2 cells were obtained as previously
described (Scaltriti et al., 2007) and cultured with hygromycin
30 mg/ml. BT474-Tr cells were obtained after 1.5 years
exposure of BT474 cells to trastuzumab (Scaltriti et al.,
2009). BEZ235, NVP-AEW541, the AKT1/2/3 inhibitor,
Lapatinib and Torin were obtained elsewhere (see Acknowledgements). The PI3K inhibitors GDC-0941 and PIK-90 were
purchased at Axon Medchem (Groningen, The Netherlands).
AZD6244 was obtained from Otava Chemicals (Toronto,
Ontario, Canada) and erlotinib from Selleck Chemicals
(Houston, TX, USA). UO126 and SRC-KI-I were purchased
at Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA) and Calbiochem
(Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. All the above compounds
were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Trastuzumab was kindly
provided by F Hoffmann, La Roche, Basel, Switzerland and
was dissolved in sterile apyrogen water.
To knockdown p110-a, we used previously published
siRNA sequences (Stealth, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) (Crowder
et al., 2009). Transfection was performed with Dharmafect 1
(Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA) at 50 nM of the siRNAs
(scramble and against p110-a) for 6 h in Optimem media
(Invitrogen). The effects of p110-a knockdown were evaluated
72 h after transfection.
Western blot, immunoprecipitation and cross-link
Protein lysates were obtained as previously described (Scaltriti
et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, total lysates were resolved by sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were hybridized with the following primary antibodies
from Cell Signaling: P-EGFR-Tyr1068, P-HER2-Tyr1221/2,

P-HER3-Tyr1289, P-Akt-Ser473, P-Akt-Thr308, Akt, P-ERKThr202/Tyr204, ERK, P-S6-Ser240/244 in 5% BSA or with
HER2 (BioGenex, Fremont, CA, USA), HER3 (NeoMarkers,
Fremont, CA, USA), EGFR (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA or
Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA for BT474) in 5% non-fat
dry milk. Mouse and rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) were
used at 1:3000 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-T/2% nonfat dry milk. Protein–antibody complexes were detected by
chemiluminescence with the SuperSignal West Dura Extended
Duration Substrate (Pierce, IL, USA), and images were
captured with a FUJIFILM LAS-3000 camera system
(Fujiﬁlm, Tokyo, Japan). The experiments were repeated at
least three times.
For immunoprecipitation experiments, volumes of 500 ml of
lysis buffer containing equal amount of protein were incubated
with 10 mg of trastuzumab or 4 mg of p85-N-SH2 domain
antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA, 06-496) overnight at
4 1C with gentle rotation. Protein A sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added for 2 h and washed three times
with lysis buffer before suspension in sodium dodecyl sulfateloading buffer.
For cross-linking experiments, cells were detached using
10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in PBS and
gentle scraping, and incubated in 5 mM bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)
suberate (BS3) for 30 min at room temperature with gentle
rotation. Cross-linking reaction was stopped by incubating
cells in 25 mM Tris–HCl for 15 min at room temperature with
gentle rotation. Cells were then processed for immunoprecipitation with trastuzumab as described above.
