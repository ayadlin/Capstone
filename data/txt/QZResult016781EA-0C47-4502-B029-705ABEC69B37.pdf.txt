Abstract
Tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) is a promising anticancer agent because it induces
apoptosis in cancer cells but not in normal cells. Unfortunately, some cancer cells develop resistance to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. Therefore, it is clinically relevant to determine
the molecular mechanisms that differentiate between TRAILsensitive and TRAIL-resistant tumors. Previously, we have
shown that the antiapoptotic molecule cellular-FLICEinhibitory protein long isoform [c-FLIP(L)] is necessary and
sufficient to maintain resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
We have found that c-FLIP(L) is transcriptionally regulated by
the activator protein-1 (AP-1) family member protein c-Fos.
Here, we report that MG-132, a small-molecule inhibitor of the
proteasome, sensitizes TRAIL-resistant prostate cancer cells
by inducing c-Fos and repressing c-FLIP(L). c-Fos, which is
activated by MG-132, negatively regulates c-FLIP(L) by direct
binding to the putative promoter region of the c-FLIP(L) gene.
In addition to activating c-Fos, MG-132 activates another
AP-1 family member, c-Jun. We show that c-Fos heterodimerizes with c-Jun to repress transcription of c-FLIP(L). Therefore, MG-132 sensitizes TRAIL-resistant prostate cancer cells
by activating the AP-1 family members c-Fos and c-Jun, which,
in turn, repress the antiapoptotic molecule c-FLIP(L). [Cancer

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in
American men accounting for 232,900 new cases and 30,350 deaths
annually (1). In a majority of cases, early-stage prostate cancer can
be treated effectively with surgery or radiotherapy. However,
advanced hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer can be a
fatal disease without effective treatment.
Cell surface death receptor ligand, tumor necrosis factor–related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), has attracted attention to
cancer therapy not only because of its ability to effectively kill
cancer cells but also because it has little effect on normal cells;
therefore, TRAIL has minimal cytotoxicity (2). TRAIL induces
apoptosis by binding to DR4 and DR5, two related death receptors,
causing the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex,
which includes the receptors, the adaptor protein FADD, and
caspase-8 (3, 4). Autoactivated caspase-8 initiates the apoptotic

executing caspase cascade and subsequent programmed cell death
(extrinsic cell death pathway). Activation of Bid to its truncated
form, tBid, leads to the release of cytochrome c from the
mitochondria, which then activates the mitochondrial-mediated
proapoptotic pathway (intrinsic cell death pathway; ref. 5).
Although many cancers undergo TRAIL-induced apoptosis,
some develop resistance (6). Cellular sensitivity for TRAIL-induced
apoptosis can be modulated at several levels. Inducing the
expression of DR5 can enhance TRAIL signaling and overcome
TRAIL resistance in cancer cells (7, 8). TRAIL-induced apoptosis
can also be modulated at the mitochondrial level by the
proapoptotic molecules Bax and Bak and the antiapoptotic
molecule Bcl-2 (9). Cellular-FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) is
another class of important intracellular antiapoptotic molecules,
which can block the apoptotic signaling pathway of TRAILinduced apoptosis. c-FLIP protein homologues interrupt apoptotic
signaling by competing with caspase-8 for binding to the DED
domains of FADD and also regulate apoptosis through their
interference with the recruitment of caspase-8 to FADD (4, 10, 11).
The levels of intracellular c-FLIP, therefore, may determine the
sensitivity of cancer cells to apoptosis triggered by TRAIL (12, 13).
The c-FLIP family of proteins, c-FLIP(L), c-FLIP(s), and perhaps the
newly detected c-FLIP(r) (14), can bind to the DED domains of
FADD and caspase-8 and regulate apoptosis through their
interference with the recruitment of caspase-8 to FADD.
We have shown in the past that persistent expression of cFLIP(L) is necessary and sufficient to maintain resistance to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis (6). Intracellular c-FLIP(L) can be
regulated at either the transcriptional, translational, or posttranslational levels. Expression of c-FLIP(L) has been shown to be
modulated by nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB; refs. 15, 16), Akt (17, 18),
c-Myc (13), p53 (19), and E3-ubiquitin ligase (20). We have found
that transcriptional repression of c-FLIP(L) by the AP-1 family
member protein c-Fos is critical in modulating resistance and
sensitivity of cells in TRAIL-induced apoptosis.1
To sensitize TRAIL-resistant cancer cells, proteosome inhibitors have been combined with TRAIL in a variety of different
cancer models. For example, the proteasome inhibitor PS-341 has
been shown to help overcome TRAIL resistance in colon and
bladder cancer cells (21–25). Another proteosome inhibitor, MG132, has a potent antitumor function and has been shown to
sensitize resistant cancer cells to the proapoptotic effects of
TRAIL (7, 8, 26, 27). In this study, we examined the mechanism
that MG-132 sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. We show that MG-132 sensitizes TRAIL-resistant

prostate cancer cells by up-regulating the AP-1 family proteins
c-Fos and c-Jun, which, in turn, repress the antiapoptotic molecule
c-FLIP(L). c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers bind to the c-FLIP(L)
promoter, repress its transcriptional activity, and reduce c-FLIP(L)
mRNA and protein levels. These findings suggest that elevated
c-Fos and c-Jun can play an important role in determining whether
a cell is responsive or resistant to the proapoptotic effects of
TRAIL.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and antibodies. Recombinant human TRAIL/TNFSF10 was
obtained from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Proteasome inhibitor
MG-132 was obtained from EMD Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Antibodies
were obtained from the following sources: horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit, and
goat anti-rat antibodies), Oct-1 (C-21), c-Fos (D1), Fos B (C-11), Fra-1 (N-17),
Fra-2 (L-15), JunB (N-17), Jun D (329), and c-Fos small interfering RNA
(siRNA) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz,
CA). c-Jun, phospho-c-Jun (Thr91), and c-Fos antibodies were obtained
from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal c-FLIP(L) antibody (Dava II)
was obtained from Apotech Corp. (San Diego, CA). Phospho-c-Fos (T232)
and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibodies were
from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, MA).
Cell lines. PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines and HEK 293T cells
were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). BPH-1
(benign prostatic hyperplasia cells immortalized with SV40 large T antigen)
cells were provided by Dr. Simon Hayward (Vanderbilt University, Nashville,
TN; ref. 28). PC3-TR was a TRAIL-resistant subline established from
parental PC3 cells by TRAIL treatment selection (6).
Cell viability and apoptosis assays. Cell viability was determined by
the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS) method (Cell TITER 96 Aqueous
Assay, Promega, Madison, WI). Cells cultured in 96-well plates were treated
with TRAIL and/or MG-132 for 24 h. MTS substrates were added and
incubated for 2 h at 37jC. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm. Viability of
control cells treated with DMSO was set at 100%, and absorbance of wells
with medium and without cells was set at zero.
For apoptosis assays, cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in
binding buffer from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), and stained with
FITC-conjugated Annexin V (Roche Diagnostic Co., Indianapolis, IN) and
propidium iodide for 15 min at room temperature. Annexin V fluorescence
was determined with a FACScan flow cytometer, and the membrane
integrity of the cells was simultaneously assessed by the propidium iodide
exclusion method.
Cell extracts and Western blot analysis. Cells were harvested for total
cell lysates with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [RIPA; 1% NP40,
50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, and
0.1% SDS] containing a mixture of protease inhibitors [cocktail 1,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 20 mmol/L, 40 mmol/L
NaF, and 3 mmol/L Na3VO4]. After sonication for 15 s, cell debris was
discarded by centrifugation at 12,000  g for 10 min at 4jC, and the
protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein
assay reagent (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). The procedure for the
nuclear protein extraction was carried out according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents kit,
Pierce Biotechnology). Cells were swollen with hypotonic buffer and then
disrupted. The cytoplasmic fraction was removed, and the nuclear protein
was released from the nuclei by a high-salt buffer. The lysate was boiled for
10 min and frozen at 80jC. Western blot was carried out as previously
described (6).
Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Total RNA was
isolated with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The RNA yield and
purity were evaluated by measuring A 260/A 280 and agarose gel electrophoresis. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was done using a Superscript
One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The total

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

RNA (0.4 Ag) was used in RT-PCR of 25 AL reaction system. cDNA synthesis
was done at 50jC for 30 min using the following cycle temperatures and
times: denaturation at 94jC for 50 seconds, annealing at 56jC for
50 seconds, and polymerization at 72jC for 2 min (total number of cycles,
30) with a final extension at 72jC for 10 min. In each reaction, the same
amount of GAPDH was used as an internal control. The primers used for
PCR were as follows: c-FLIP(L), 5¶-GTCTGCTGAAGTCATCCATCAG-3¶
( forward) and 5¶-CTTATGTGTAGGAGAGGATAAG-3¶ (reverse); c-Fos,
5¶-GAATAAGATGGCTGCAGCCAAATGC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-AAGGAAGACGTGTAAGCAGTGCAGC-3¶ (reverse); and GAPDH, 5¶-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC3¶ (reverse). The PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gels, stained
with ethidium bromide, and photographed.
Luciferase assay. c-FLIP(L) promoter luciferase structure was kindly
provided by Dr. W.S. El-Deiry (University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, PA;
ref. 13). Cells were seeded into 24-well plates. When cells reached 50% to
80% confluence, both AP-1 luciferase reporter (25 ng/well) and Renilla
reporter (5 ng/well) from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) or c-FLIP(L) promoter
and Renilla reporter were cotransfected into cells. In other experiments,
c-Fos siRNA or full-length human c-Fos cDNA plasmid was transfected into
cells for 24 h before transfection of luciferase and Renilla. Renilla acted here
as an internal control for transfection efficiency. After 24 h of transfection,
cells were treated with TRAIL (100 ng/mL). Thereafter, cells were collected,
prepared, and further detected by using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were
stored at 20jC until detection. All results represent an average of at least
three independent experiments F SD.
Transfection with c-Fos vector or c-Fos siRNA. A full-length human
c-Fos cDNA, provided by Dr. L Shemshedini (University of Toledo, Toledo,
OH), was cloned into a pSG5 vector (29). Plasmids with or without c-Fos
were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies).
siRNA of c-Fos was then transfected into cells by TransMessenger
Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After transfection with the c-Fos vector for 24 h or the
c-Fos siRNA for 36 to 48 h, the cells were seeded in 96-well plates for cell
viability assays or treated with TRAIL for Western blot assays.
Immunocoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Cells were lysed at
4jC for 30 min in RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Lysates
were centrifuged at 12,000  g at 4jC for 10 min to remove insoluble
materials. The supernatants were then collected, and the total protein was
determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Supernatants of equal amounts of
protein were incubated at 4jC overnight with either c-Fos antibody or IgG
control antibody. Protein A-Sepharose was added and incubated at 4jC for
1 to 4 h. The immunocomplexes were washed thrice in cold lysis buffer.
The bound proteins were eluted from the column in preheated sample
buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 50 mmol/L DTT, 1% SDS, 0.005%
bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol] and denatured by boiling for 5 min. The
immunoprecipitates and whole lysate proteins were then subjected to 4%
to 12% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis was done with the indicated
antibodies.
Cell extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Frozen cell
pellets were resuspended in 4 volumes of lysis buffer: 20 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.9); 0.2 mmol/L EDTA; 0.2 mmol/L EGTA; 10% glycerol; 10 mmol/L Na
molybdate; 2 mmol/L Na PPi; 2 mmol/L Na orthovanadate; 0.5 mmol/L
spermidine; 0.15 mmol/L spermine; 50 Amol/L N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine
chloromethyl ketone; 25 Amol/L N-a-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone;
1 Ag/mL each of aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin; 0.5 mmol/L
benzamidine; 1 mmol/L DTT; and 0.5 mmol/L PMSF. KCl was added to
400 mmol/L final, and the extracts were incubated at 4jC for 30 min and
centrifuged at 10,000  g for 5 min. The supernatant contained the wholecell extracts. The reactions were made using 3 AL of whole-cell extract and
0.1 to 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded specific oligonucleotides
(5,000–25,000 cpm) and run on 5% to 7% polyacrylamide gels containing
0.5 Tris glycine EDTA. Gels were dried with Bio-Rad gel dryer (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) and imaged using Kodak BioMax MR Film (Fisher Scientific,
Atlanta, GA). General AP-1 gel shift oligonucleotide was obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Wild-type oligonucleotides of the c-FLIP(L)

AP-1-( f) site was designed as 5¶-ATCACTTGAGGATCACTTGAGGATCACTTGAGGATCACTTGAGG-3¶.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was done using the ChIP Assay kit (Upstate Cell
Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY). PC3-TR cells were cultured in 10-cm
dishes and treated with TRAIL and/or MG-132 for 4 h. Cross-linking of
DNA and proteins were fixed by adding formaldehyde directly to the
culture medium to a final concentration of 1% and incubated for 10 min at
37jC. Cells were collected and washed with PBS that contained protease
inhibitors. Harvested cells were resuspended in 200 AL of SDS lysis buffer
for 10 min. Cell lysates were sonicated and samples were centrifuged at
12,000  g for 10 min at 4jC, and the supernatant was harvested.
Concentration of each sample was quantitated by the BCA technique
(Pierce Biotechnology). Positive controls were 10% of each DNA sample,
which did not include the immunoprecipitation step. The remainder of the
samples was divided equally into two groups. The experimental group was
immunoprecipitated with specific c-Fos (D-1) antibody, whereas the
negative control group was immunoprecipitated with the general IgG
antibody. After eluting protein-DNA from antibody, protein-DNA crosslinking was reversed by heating at 65jC for 4 h. The isolated genomic DNA
was first purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Then, the DNA was amplified by PCR, using specific primers
encompassing the region containing the AP-1-( f) binding site according to
the human c-FLIP(L) sequence (Genbank). The conditions were as follows:
primers 5¶-CCTGTGATCCCAGCACTTTG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-CACCATGCCCGACTAATTTT-3¶ (reverse); denaturation at 94jC for 30 seconds;
annealing at 56jC for 45 seconds; polymerization at 72jC for 30 seconds,
for 25 cycles. Finally, PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and
visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

Results
MG-132 sensitizes TRAIL-resistant prostate cancer cells to
undergo apoptosis. Although PC3 cells are sensitive to TRAILinduced apoptosis, PC3-TR and LNCaP cells are resistant to the
proapoptotic effects of TRAIL (Fig. 1A; ref. 6). Combination of
TRAIL with MG-132 sensitizes resistant prostate cancer cells,
PC3-TR, and LNCaP, to undergo apoptosis (Fig. 1B and C). Because
TRAIL is more effective against cancer cells than benign immortalized cells (2), we wished to determine whether the effect of
MG-132 + TRAIL is specific to cancer cells or whether immortalized but nontumorigenic cells undergo cell death. Nontumorigenic and immortalized 293T (human embryonic kidney) and
BPH-1 (benign prostatic hyperplasia) cells were treated with MG132, TRAIL, or in combination with MG-132 + TRAIL. We found
that neither treatment as single agents nor combination of treatments promoted cell death in the immortalized noncancerous cell
lines (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that MG-132 is capable of
sensitizing cancerous cells, but not benign transformed cells, to
undergo TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
Combination of TRAIL and MG-132 represses c-FLIP(L) and
induces c-Fos. The antiapoptotic protein c-FLIP(L) plays an
important role in TRAIL sensitivity of cancer cells. We have shown
in the past that persistent expression of c-FLIP(L) is necessary and
sufficient to maintain resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (6).
In addition, we have found that in TRAIL-sensitive cancer cells, the
antiapoptotic molecule c-FLIP(L) is repressed by the AP-1 family
protein c-Fos, a mechanism that is lacking in TRAIL-resistant
cancer cells.1 Because MG-132 sensitizes resistant cancer cells to
undergo TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we wished to determine
whether the ability of c-Fos to repress c-FLIP(L) is restored in
the presence of MG-132.
c-FLIP(L) protein and mRNA levels were maintained when the
resistant PC3-TR cells were treated with either TRAIL or MG-132

alone (Fig. 2A). However, the combination of MG-132 + TRAIL led
to reduction of the antiapoptotic molecule c-FLIP(L) at the mRNA
level and protein levels, as shown by the semiquantitative RT-PCR
and Western blot analyses (Fig. 2A). The c-FLIP(L) mRNA level was
noticeably reduced 12 h after treatment with MG-132 and TRAIL.
Because we have found that up-regulation of the AP-1 family
protein c-Fos is necessary for TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we
examined whether c-Fos levels are up-regulated in the presence
of MG-132. We found that c-Fos protein and mRNA levels were
increased in the presence of MG-132 alone (Fig. 2B), a condition
that does not promote cell death in resistant prostate cancer cells
(Fig. 1B and D). However, combination of MG-132 and TRAIL
sensitizes prostate cancer cells to undergo cell death while
promoting c-Fos levels at the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2B).
Decrease in c-FLIP(L) and increase in c-Fos protein levels are
observed in a time-dependent (Fig. 2C) and dose-dependent (data
not shown) manner. Because c-Fos is a well established
transcription factor (30–32), we determined whether there is any
significant change in nuclear c-Fos levels in the presence of MG132. We found that nuclear c-Fos, and more specifically
phosphorylated nuclear c-Fos, was increased when treated with
MG-132 or MG-132 + TRAIL (Fig. 2D). This result shows that MG132 sensitizes resistant prostate cancer cancers to undergo
apoptosis (Fig. 1) by repressing expression of c-FLIP(L) and
promoting expression of c-Fos. Similar to our previous results,
increased expression of c-Fos in response to MG-132 does not
induce cell death; it only primes resistant prostate cancer cells to
undergo apoptosis (Figs. 1 and 2).
Combination of TRAIL and MG-132 increases AP-1 activity
and decreases c-FLIP(L) promoter activity. Because the
combination of MG-132 and TRAIL reduces the expression of
c-FLIP(L) and enhances the expression of the AP-1 family member
c-Fos (Fig. 2), we wished to determine whether there is any direct
interaction between the transcription factor AP-1/c-Fos and the
antiapoptotic molecule c-FLIP(L). First, we examined the luciferase
AP-1 activity in the resistant PC3-TR cells. We found that MG-132
alone or combination of MG-132 + TRAIL significantly enhanced
the AP-1 activity in the resistant PC3-TR cells after 24 h of
treatment (Fig. 3A). Enhancement of AP-1 activity was particularly
pronounced when MG-132 was combined with TRAIL (Fig. 3A).
c-FLIP(L) promoter activity was not significantly changed in the
presence of MG-132; however, the combination of MG-132 + TRAIL
led to significant reduction of the c-FLIP(L) promoter activity
(Fig. 3B). This result, again, suggests that the proteosome inhibitor,
MG-132 alone, sensitizes resistant prostate cancer cells to undergo
apoptosis by enhancing AP-1 activity, which only in the presence
of the proapoptotic agent TRAIL will lead to repression of the
c-FLIP(L) antiapoptotic molecule (Fig. 2).
Next, we examined whether inhibition of c-Fos by siRNA can
affect c-FLIP(L) promoter activity. To ensure that our siRNA was
functioning as expected, AP-1 activity and c-Fos protein levels were
assessed in the presence or absence of c-Fos siRNA. We found that
AP-1 activity and c-Fos protein levels were reduced in the PC3-TR
cells in the presence of c-Fos siRNA (Fig. 3C). In addition,
inhibition of c-Fos by siRNA led to increased c-FLIP(L) promoter
activity (Fig. 3C).
Next, we wished to examine the effect of inhibiting c-Fos by
siRNA on c-FLIP(L) promoter activity when treated with MG-132
and TRAIL. The luciferase activity in the control groups were
normalized (Fig. 3D). Then, we examined the luciferase activity
when the cells were treated with MG-132, TRAIL, or MG-132

+ TRAIL. We found that c-FLIP(L) promoter luciferase activity did
not differ significantly from the controls when the cells were
treated with MG-132 or TRAIL alone. c-FLIP(L) promoter activity
decreased in the cells that were treated with MG-132 + TRAIL (Fig.
3D, last two columns). However, c-Fos siRNA rescued and promoted
c-FLIP(L) promoter activity when the cells were treated with MG132 + TRAIL (Fig. 3D, last two columns). In addition, c-Fos siRNA
helped maintain the expression of c-FLIP(L) protein (Fig. 4A).
To determine whether inhibition of c-Fos by siRNA had any

functional role, we examined the cell viability of PC3-TR cells. As

resistant to cell death than controls when treated with MG-132 +
TRAIL (Fig. 4B, last two columns).

activity, and sensitizes prostate cancer cells to undergo apoptosis.
MG-132 up-regulates AP-1 activity by increasing nuclear
translocation of c-Fos/c-Jun and their interaction. AP-1 family
transcription factors are dimeric protein complexes composed of
heterodimers between Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2), Jun
(c-Jun, JunB, and JunD), and activating transcription factor (ATF)
family gene products, which convert extracellular signals into
changes of specific target gene expression (31, 32). Because we
found that the AP-1 activity of PC3-TR cells are increased in
response to MG-132 (Fig. 3A), we wished to examine whether any
other AP-1 family members, besides c-Fos (Fig. 2), plays a key role
in sensitizing cancer cells and regulating promoter activity of
c-FLIP(L) during TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We found that MG-132
increased levels of c-Jun protein in PC3-TR cells, whereas there
was no significant change in the protein levels of other AP-1
members (FosB, JunB, JunD, Fra-1, and Fra-2; Fig. 5A). In
particular, nuclear levels of total c-Jun and phospho c-Jun were
significantly increased (Fig. 5B).
c-Fos functions as a transcription factor by heterodimerizing
with c-Jun and other AP-1 family members (31, 32). To determine
whether the increased c-Fos and c-Jun nuclear levels after MG-132
treatment are associated with direct interactions between c-Fos
and c-Jun, immunoprecipitation experiments between c-Fos and
c-Jun were done. We found that direct interactions between c-Fos
and c-Jun were increased in PC3-TR cells when the cells were
exposed to MG-132. Similar results were obtained when MG-132
was combined with TRAIL. However, TRAIL alone did not enhance
c-Fos/c-Jun interactions (Fig. 5C). Similar results were obtained
when c-Jun antibody was used for the immunoprecipitation
experiments (Fig. 5C). Therefore, the proteosome inhibitor MG132 enhances c-Fos and c-Jun levels, enhances direct interactions

between c-Fos and c-Jun, and presumably promotes heterodimerization and transcriptional activity.
c-Fos and c-Jun bind to the c-FLIP(L) promoter region. To
determine whether increased protein levels of c-Fos and c-Jun in
response to MG-132 is associated with increased DNA binding,
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and EMSA supershift
assays were done. We found that AP-1 DNA binding is increased in
the presence of MG-132, TRAIL, or MG-132 + TRAIL. However, we
observed supershift bands for c-Fos and c-Jun particularly when
the cells were treated with MG-132, demonstrating the specificity
of binding of these AP-1 family member proteins in response to
MG-132 (Fig. 6A).
Because c-Fos and c-Jun DNA binding is increased in response
to treatment of cells with MG-132 and c-Fos represses the
antiapoptotic molecule c-FLIP(L), we wished to determine if
c-Fos and c-Jun specifically bind to the c-FLIP(L) putative
promoter region. Previously, we examined 14 potential AP-1
binding sites upstream and within the first intron of c-FLIP(L)
coding region (Fig. 6B). We found binding of c-Fos only to the
AP-1-( f) site (see Fig. 6B) in the putative promoter region of
c-FLIP(L).1 We have found that in prostate cancer cells that are
sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, mutations or deletions to
the AP-1-( f) site abrogates binding of c-Fos, increases c-FLIP(L)
promoter activity, and converts the phenotype of TRAIL-sensitive
prostate cancer cells to become TRAIL resistant. Therefore, in our
current model, with TRAIL-resistant prostate cancer cells that are
sensitized by MG-132, we wished to determine whether there is
increased binding of c-Fos and/or c-Jun at the AP-1-( f) site of
c-FLIP(L). ChIP experiments were done to determine direct binding of c-Fos and c-Jun at the AP-1-( f) site. There was no significant binding of either c-Fos or c-Jun to the AP-1-( f) site of
c-FLIP(L) without treatment or with TRAIL treatment alone.
However, in the presence of MG-132, both c-Fos and c-Jun showed
enhanced binding to the c-FLIP(L) AP-1-( f) site (Fig. 6C). These
data show that MG-132 sensitizes resistant prostate cancer cells

to proapoptotic effects of TRAIL by enhancing c-Fos and c-Jun
interactions and transcriptionally repressing the expression of
c-FLIP(L) by binding to the AP-1-( f) site of c-FLIP(L).

Discussion
TRAIL has great potential as an antitumor agent because it can
selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells, yet spare most normal
cells. Although many cancer cells are sensitive to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis, some develop resistance. Many groups have been
investigating the synergistic effects of different drugs in combination with TRAIL to overcome the resistance developed by cancer
cells (8, 20, 21, 33–38). In the present study, we showed that TRAIL
combined with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 could effectively
sensitize TRAIL-resistant prostate cancer cells to undergo

apoptosis. Moreover, this combined treatment did not induce
death in nonmalignant cell (BPH-1 and HEK 293T; Fig. 1). MG-132
sensitizes TRAIL-resistant prostate cancer cells by up-regulating
the AP-1 family proteins c-Fos and c-Jun, which, in turn, repress
the antiapoptotic molecule c-FLIP(L). As for the other well studied
c-FLIP isoform, c-FLIP(s), we have not found it to be expressed in
our prostate cancer cells. Therefore, the effects of MG-132 on
c-FLIP(s) was not examined in our study.
Proteasome inhibitors are attractive cancer therapeutic agents
because they can regulate apoptosis-related proteins (e.g.,TRAF2,
BAX, IAP, and p53 proteins; refs. 12, 23–25). PS-341 has been
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of
patients with multiple myeloma, and many clinical trials are
ongoing to examine the efficacy of PS-341 for treatment of other
malignancies (39, 40). MG-132 is another small-molecule proteasome inhibitor, and numerous reports have shown that MG-132
inhibits NF-nB activation through stabilization of the inhibitor of
nB/NF-nB complex, as well as prevention of nuclear translocation
of NF-nB (41, 42). Other mechanisms that MG-132 sensitize cancer
cells include increased expression of mitogen-activated protein
kinase and activation of c-Jun-NH2-kinase (26, 27) or up-regulation
of death receptor DR5 and Bik accumulation (7, 8, 26, 27).
In the current study, we determined whether TRAIL-resistant
prostate cancer cells, which are sensitized by MG-132, have
changes in the AP-1/c-Fos and c-FLIP(L) signaling pathway. In the
presence of MG-132, we found that inhibition of c-Fos by siRNA led
to up-regulation of c-FLIP(L) promoter activity, and, conversely,
ectopic expression of c-Fos reduced c-FLIP(L) promoter activity
(Fig. 3). After priming the resistant prostate cancer cells by MG-132
to undergo apoptosis, we showed that the AP-1 family members
c-Fos and c-Jun directly bind to the c-FLIP(L) AP-1( f) site (Fig. 6)
after treatment with TRAIL.
In TRAIL-sensitive prostate cancer cells, we have found that
the AP-1 family member proteins only bind to the AP-1-( f) site of
the c-FLIP(L) promoter region and none of the other putative AP-1
binding sites in the putative promoter region of c-FLIP(L). Deletions
and mutations at the c-FLIP(L) AP-1( f) site abrogate binding of
c-Fos to the c-FLIP(L) promoter and maintain expression of
c-FLIP(L) promoter activity.1 The current study shows that treatment of resistant prostate cancer cells with MG-132 potentiates
binding of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins to the c-FLIP(L) AP-1-( f) site
(Fig. 6B and C). Although binding of c-Fos/c-Jun to the putative
promoter region of c-FLIP(L) after treatment with MG-132 may be
necessary, it is not sufficient to reduce c-FLIP(L) mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2). Therefore, addition of TRAIL to MG-132 induces
other factors to repress c-FLIP(L) levels and potentiate cell death.
The AP-1 transcription factor is composed of protein dimers
between the Jun, Fos, and ATF family members. The predominant
forms of AP-1 in most cells are Fos/Jun heterodimers, which have a
high affinity for binding to an AP-1 site. The regulation of these
transcription factors is critical in determining the response to
various physiologic and environmental stimuli (31, 32). In addition
to c-Fos, we found that c-Jun was another AP-1 family protein that
was activated by MG-132. c-Jun protein levels increased in the
TRAIL-resistant cancer cells after treatment with MG-132. More
specifically, MG-132 promoted expression of nuclear c-Jun protein
and heterodimerization with c-Fos and binding to the c-FLIP(L)
promoter (Fig. 5). These results suggest that c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers may act concomitantly to down-regulate c-FLIP(L)
expression and sensitize resistant cancer cells to undergo TRAILinduced apoptosis.

MG-132 and c-Fos/c-Jun for TRAIL-Induced Apoptosis

TRAIL for 24 h. B, Western blot analysis of
nuclear protein for total c-Jun and

C, immunoprecipitation (IP ) assay
between c-Fos and c-Jun protein. PC3-TR
cells were treated with MG-132 (1 Amol/L),
TRAIL (100 ng/mL), or MG-132
combined with TRAIL for 4 h.
Equal-quantity whole-cells lysates were
immunoprecipitated using c-Fos or
c-Jun antibody. The resulting immune
complex was subjected to Western blot
analysis. Input was 2% of the total
from each sample of immunoprecipitation.

Activation of AP-1 family members by other tumor necrosis
factor (TNF) family signaling pathways, besides TRAIL, has been
implicated. For example, the TNF receptor member receptor
activator of NF-nB ligand (RANKL) is a key regulator of bone
homeostasis. RANKL induces expression of c-Fos, an important
step in bone development. To maintain proper balance in bone
development, c-Fos activates its own inhibitor, IFN-h, to reduce
RANKL signaling. Thus, an autoregulatory mechanism involving

c-Fos, the TNF receptor family member RANKL, and IFN-h play a
crucial role in bone development (43). In the present study, we
identified a similar autoregulatory mechanism that involves c-Fos/
c-Jun heterodimerization in TRAIL-resistant cancer cells.
We postulate that posttranslational modifications of AP-1 family
member proteins, particularly c-Fos and c-Jun, play an important
role in determining whether cancer cells are sensitive or resistant
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Cellular localization and activation of

Figure 7. Model for MG-132 priming and sensitization of TRAIL-resistant
cancer cells. Cells are primed after exposure to MG-132 by up-regulation of AP-1
(c-Fos/c-Jun) but do not undergo cell death (A ). However, combination of
MG-132 and TRAIL primes cancer cells and promotes apoptosis of TRAILresistant prostate cancer cells (B).

c-Fos and c-Jun can depend on their phosphorylation, protein
stability, and other chaperone proteins. Recent work has suggested
that phosphorylation of c-Fos, which is an important determinant
of its activity and expression, is tightly regulated by a variety of
kinases (20, 44–48). Protein stability of c-Fos, another regulator of
its physiologic function, has been shown to be dependent on its
COOH-terminal PEST3 domain, which modulates the proteosomemediated degradation of c-Fos (49). Associated proteins in the
form of chaperone proteins or heterodimers can also regulate
c-Fos structure and function. Therefore, we believe that c-Fos and
c-Jun posttranslational modifications can significantly affect its

ability to regulate c-FLIP(L) gene expression and TRAIL-induced
apoptosis, and it is an area under investigation in our laboratory.
One limitation of our study is that MG-132 is a general
proteosome inhibitor and can affect many different molecular
pathways. Noting this limitation, we focused our attention on the
effect of MG-132 on the AP-1–related protein c-Fos. Because our
prior work has suggested that c-Fos, and not other AP-1 protein
family members, is an important modulator of c-FLIP(L) protein,
we primarily focused our attention on the effects of c-Fos and
c-FLIP(L). However, our present results suggest that sensitization
of TRAIL-resistant cancer cells by MG-132 lead to increased levels
of c-Jun, as well as to c-Fos, a finding not seen in TRAIL-sensitive
cells. In particular, we showed that DNA binding of c-Jun to
potential AP-1 sites after treatment with TRAIL may be more
pronounced than binding of c-Fos to potential AP-1 sites (Fig. 6).
Our future studies will determine whether c-Fos and c-Jun have an
equal or disproportionate effect on transcriptional regulation of
c-FLIP(L) and modulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancer
cells that are sensitized by the proteosome inhibitor MG-132.
In summary, we show that MG-132 primes and sensitizes
TRAIL-resistant prostate cancer cells to undergo apoptosis by
activating the AP-1 family member proteins c-Fos and c-Jun
(Fig. 7A). Combination of MG-132 with TRAIL in TRAIL-resistant
prostate cancer cells promotes cell death by increased heterodimerization of c-Fos/c-Jun and direct repression of the c-FLIP(L)
antiapoptotic molecule (Fig. 7B). Therefore, we report a new
regulatory pathway by which MG-132 sensitizes cancer cells for
apoptosis, and combination of TRAIL with proteosome inhibitors
may be an effective strategy for treating TRAIL-refractory tumors.
