BACKGROUND. For patients with stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who
present with brain metastasis (BMs), standard platinum-based chemotherapy regimens have challenged the role of up-front whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT).

METHODS. In this survey, the authors analyzed the decision tree by which 6 oncologic centers guided the pattern of care in an unselected population of patients
with NSCLC who presented with BMs at first diagnosis. The impact of front-line,
platinum-based chemotherapy also was evaluated. Individual data were reviewed
from 156 eligible patients who were referred to participating centers.

RESULTS. Up-front treatment included chemotherapy in 110 patients and WBRT followed by chemotherapy in 46 patients. The selection of first treatment was guided
based mainly on the presence of by BM symptoms, with chemotherapy selected for

Management of NSCLC With Up-front BMs/Moscetti et al.

in pathologic series.1 A major challenge concerns the
subset of patients that presents with synchronous
brain metastasis (BMs), ranging between 25% and
30% of new cases.2 Until recently, BMs have been
considered a terminal event of disease, radically influencing both the decision-making process and treatment selection. Thus, most patients who had NSCLC
with BMs were judged unsuitable for chemotherapy
and received palliative whole-brain radiotherapy
(WBRT) to control or prevent central nervous system
(CNS) symptoms.3–5 Because this subset of patients
usually was excluded from clinical trials that included
chemotherapy, few outcome data currently are available
on the impact of contemporary chemotherapy regimens, resulting in the misleading assumption that
chemotherapy does not play any role for this clinical
presentation. Although the optimal treatment modality
for patients with synchronous BMs from NSCLC has
not been established to date, and no definite algorithm
exists for the pattern of care, the first treatment option
currently is driven by the patient’s clinical status (ie,
CNS symptoms) and local practices (ie, referred specialist and hospital resources).
Although surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
may represent adequate treatment for patients who
have a single BM and no other extracranial sites of disease, the common approach that includes WBRT followed
by chemotherapy may not represent the treatment of
choice when BM symptoms are absent or are managed
well by supportive therapy. Chemotherapy has played
a limited role in the management of BMs because of
the inability of chemotherapeutic agents to cross the
blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is considered the
main reason for the reduced activity of cytotoxic drugs
at this site. Nonetheless, it is widely accepted that
some modifications in the BB occur in the presence of
metastasis; and, although the mechanisms underlying
the increased permeability of BBB are not known, clinical data indicate that chemotherapeutic agents can
reach the brain tumor site, exerting antitumor effects
similar to those exerted at extracranial sites. Recent
advances have clarified some of the mechanisms that
underlay molecular transport across the BBB and the
action of chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat primary and secondary CNS tumors.6–9
Moreover, data from recent Phase III trials in
patients with advanced NSCLC have pointed out the
activity of newer chemotherapy regimens on brain site
of metastases and have challenged the role of upfront
WBRT as a standard option in this setting.10–12 Unfortunately, the number of patients with BMs enrolled on
those trials was low and did not permit any definitive
conclusion. Herein, we report the results from a multicenter survey that sought to analyze the decision tree

275

by which 6 oncologic centers participating in the Outcome Research Network for Evaluation of Treatment
Results in Oncology consortium (an Italian group for
outcome research) guided the pattern of care in a
cohort of unselected patients with NSCLC who presented with BMs at first diagnosis and to establish the
activity of newer platinum-based chemotherapy as
frontline treatment in this setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participating Centers
Three centers were represented by the following Academic Institutions: the National Cancer Institute Regina Elena, the Oncology Unit of ‘‘La Sapienza’’
University of Rome, and the Campus Biomedico University of Rome. The remaining centers were general
hospitals represented by the Oncology Units of Belcolle Hospital of Viterbo, S.S. Trinita Hospital of Sora,
and Forlanini Hospital of Rome. Neurosurgery was
available in 3 centers (2 academic institutions and 1
general hospital), and radiotherapy facilities were
available in 4 centers. SRS or a g knife unit was not
available in any of participating institutions.
Eligibility
Starting in January 2001, we collected and reviewed the
clinical data from patients who met the following criteria: pathologic proof of NSCLC, stage IV disease with
synchronous BMs at presentation evaluated by brain
computed tomography scans with additional magnetic
resonance imaging studies in selected patients, aged
80 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status (PS) 2, and eligibility for platinum-based chemotherapy. All patients for whom WBRT
represented the first treatment choice had to receive at
least 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy after
local treatment. Patients were defined as symptomatic
for BMs when at 1 episode of seizures and/or intracranial hypertension syndrome or focal neurologic impairment occurred during the 4 weeks before the start of
every specific treatment. Except for primary tumor status (which was not applicable in this context), all
remaining factors, including: ECOG PS, extracranial systemic metastases, and age, were used to stratify patients
according to the 3 classes of recursive partitioning
analysis developed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology
Group (RTOG).13
Statistical Analysis
The Pearson chi-square test and the Fisher exact test
were used to compare treatment groups with respect
to baseline demographic characteristics and estimates
of response rates. Overall survival and progression-

free survival (PFS) were calculated according to the
Kaplan-Meier method from the first date of treatment
to the date of disease progression or death.14 If a
patient was not dead, then survival was censored at
the time of their last visit. PFS was calculated from
the date of first treatment to the date of disease progression or death. If a patient had not progressed,
then the time to progression was censored at the time
of their last visit.
A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model
also was developed by using stepwise regression with
the predictive variables that were significant in the
univariate analyses. The entry and removal limits
were P ¼ .10 and P ¼ .15, respectively. Univariate and
multivariate analyses were planned for overall survival
outcome. Version 11.0 of the SPSS statistical program
was used for analysis. Site-specific and overall tumor
responses were evaluated according to the standard
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors15 after
the second or third course of chemotherapy.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
One hundred sixty-nine patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in the survey. Thirty-seven
patients (21.9%) presented with solitary brain metastasis, and 13 patients (7.7%) underwent neurosurgery
as there first treatment option and were excluded
from the final analysis because of the small sample
size and the different pattern of care. Consequently,
156 patients were eligible for the definitive analysis:
15.5% of patients had a single BM, 20.5% of patients
had 2 BMs, 64% of patients had 3 BMs, and 41% of
patients had 1 brain lesion that measured 3 cm in
greatest dimension. The median age was 62 years,
most patients were men, most had adenocarcinoma as
their main histology, and most had a PS of 0 or 1 at diagnosis. In addition to intrathoracic disease, the brain
was the unique site of metastasis in 26% of patients. A
symptomatic CNS involvement was described in 36%
of patients, but symptoms were controlled adequately
by medical therapy in 89% of patients. Informed consent was obtained from every patient before any treatment was started.
Chemotherapy was chosen as frontline treatment
for 70% of patients, and the remaining 30% of patients
received upfront WBRT followed by chemotherapy. On
the basis of upfront treatment selected by each participating physician (ie, either upfront cisplatin-based
chemotherapy or WBRT followed by cisplatin-based
chemotherapy), we defined 2 cohorts of patients to
carry out activity and efficacy analyses. The patients’
characteristics are shown in Table 1. A significant dif-

received primary WBRT in academic institutions, and
chemotherapy represented the most common first
option for symptomatic patients in general hospitals.

Chemotherapy Regimens
All patients received platinum-based chemotherapy, as
detailed in Table 1. In both cohorts, a large majority of
patients received a gemcitabine/platinum-based regimen. The median number of courses delivered was 4
for both cohorts (range, 1–9 courses). The median time
to the start of first treatment was 21 days for patients
who received chemotherapy (range, 2–60 days) and 19
days for patients who received WBRT (range, 4–51
days). For patients in the radiation cohort, as expected,
chemotherapy was started later (35 days; range, 2–60
days) than for patients in the chemotherapy cohort (21
days; range, 2–60 days; P ¼.0004). It is noteworthy that
only 22% of patients received sequential WBRT for
progressive brain disease in the chemotherapy cohort.
Conversely, 48% and 41% of patients received secondor third-line therapy in the chemotherapy and WBRT
cohorts, respectively.
Response
Three patients were not evaluable for intracranial or
extracranial response (both in the chemotherapy
cohort). Table 2 lists the results of the response evaluation reported on the basis of intention to treat. For
the whole sample, the rate of brain response (intracranial disease) was 29.5%, whereas the overall
response rate (including extracranial disease) to systemic chemotherapy was 36.5%. In the chemotherapy
cohort, the response rates were 27.3% for brain sites

and 34.5% for extracerebral disease, for an overall
response rate of 34.5%. In the WBRT cohort, these
rates were 34.7%, 41.3%, and 41.3%, respectively. All
differences were nonsignificant.

Survival and PFS
After a median follow-up of 9 months (range, 1–52
months), the median survival for all patients was
11 months, and the 3-year rate survival was 5%. The
subgroup of patients who had the brain as their single
site of extrathoracic disease reached a median survival of 10 months compared with 12 months for
patients who had additional systemic sites (Fig. 1).
The presence of symptomatic CNS involvement at diagnosis did not affect overall survival, which was
11 months for both symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.

these factors, disease control (complete responses,

chemotherapy was identified as an independent predictor for PFS. Results of the univariate and multivariate analyses for median survival and PFS are reported
in Table 4.

DISCUSSION

FIGURE 4. Three-year overall survival by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
(RTOG) classification.

With regard to the first treatment option, the median survival was 10 months for the chemotherapy
cohort and 14 months for the WBRT cohort (P ¼ .07)
(Fig. 2). The 2-years PFS was 6 months for both
cohorts (Fig. 3). According to the RTOG classification,
the median survival was 16 months for patients with
class I disease and 10 months for patients with class II
and III disease (P ¼ .02) (Fig. 4). No difference in
terms of median survival or PFS was observed among
any of the chemotherapy regimens employed. The
complete data on median survival and PFS are reported in Table 3.
The multivariate analysis of prognostic factors
showed that a best response at the brain site, the
ECOG PS, and the RTOG class were independent
prognostic factors for overall survival. In addition to

Although recent advances in systemic chemotherapy
for patients with advanced NSCLC have led to
improved survival and defined guidelines, the optimal
treatment for the same patients with synchronous
BMs remains to be defined.16,17 In these circumstances, radiotherapy (WBRT or SRS) may represent
the standard of care, although >50% of these patients
die as a result of systemic disease progression, and
their median survival remains at <4 months.18 Therefore, a major question remains concerning the role of
systemic chemotherapy with current platinum-based
regimes in this clinical setting.
Several specific, but small, Phase II trials have been
conducted to date. These trials adopted chemotherapy
regimens that contained drugs believed to cross to the
BBB, like temozolomide and teniposide, which nonetheless cannot be considered an optimal choice for systemic disease control.19–26 Consequently, the survival
rates reached in those studies generally were unsatisfactory compared with the results achieved by standard
platinum-based regimens in the subset of patients with
BMs entered on larger Phase III studies (Table 5).

The current survey was undertaken to clarify the
major open questions for the subset of patients with
synchronous BMs observed in current practice, including the real prognosis for this subset of patients, the
clinical and local factors (eg, referred specialist and
hospital facilities) that guide the choice of treatment,
and especially the activity and efficacy of current
chemotherapy regimens on both brain and systemic
sites of disease.
We believe that the results of the current survey
point out relevant messages for the clinical oncologist.
The median survival and PFS for the entire cohort
were similar to those reported for patients with advanced NSCLC without BM who were enrolled on
major clinical trials. With regard of the pattern of care
for symptomatic patients, WBRT was selected for 63%
of patients, and only 24% of patients received chemotherapy. Similarly, 46% of patients had 2 sites of metastatic disease in the chemotherapy cohort, compared

279

with 28% of patients in the WBRT cohort. These
straightforward findings highlight symptomatic CNS
involvement and limited disease extent as the main
determinants for choosing WBRT as the more appropriate upfront treatment. Conversely, asymptomatic
CNS involvement and an elevated burden of metastatic disease would be treated more appropriately
with upfront systemic chemotherapy.
There was no significant difference in our survey
between the objective brain response rate and the
global response rate. Chemotherapy alone appeared
to produce a 27% response rate in the brain, which
was not statistically significant different from the 35%
rate obtained in the WBRT cohort, in which brain
response evaluation was performed after 2 or 3 cycles
of chemotherapy. The difference observed in term of
median survival between the 2 cohorts, although they
were not statistically significant, may have been
caused by the unfavorable imbalance in chemotherapy group, which had more patients with adenocarcinoma and more metastatic sites because of RTOG
class II or III disease.
The multivariate analysis pointed out interesting
data on the clinical significance of brain response.
This has been identified as an independent prognostic
factor for both median survival and PFS. A modified
RTOG classification (including all but the primary tumor status factors from class I) was the other independent prognostic factor for survival, which reflects
the magnitude of clinical factors like PS, age, and the
extent of disease.
The activity and efficacy results from our survey
confirmed the findings obtained in the subsets of
patients with synchronous BMs from major randomized clinical trials.9–11 Moreover, our results clearly
were consistent with those described in a few specific
Phase II trials that tested standard, platinum-based
chemotherapy for patients with NSCLC who presented with BMs.27–28
The unique and specific Phase III study by Robinet and colleagues compared upfront chemotherapy
with cisplatin and vinorelbine with or without concomitant WBRT. In their trial, those authors did not
observe any significant difference between the 2
arms, although they did report that their patients had
a poor prognosis, a median survival of 5 months.29
Those dismal results may be explained by the selection of patients with adverse prognostic factors and
the choice of highly toxic chemotherapy regimens.
Again, the brain activity results from that trial were
consistent with our current findings.
Overall, these results should change the inaccurate
impression that the brain represents a sanctuary that
is unreachable by chemotherapy. Third-generation,

* Survival data were based on the outcome of the overall population enrolled in the trial.

platinum-based regimens are effective treatment for
BMs from advanced NSCLC and should be considered
an appropriate treatment choice.
The optimal treatment strategy for patients with
advanced NSCLC who have BMs remains undefined
because of the lack of specific randomized trials. To
date, the choice of treatment for these patients should
be guided mainly by the pattern of initial symptoms
and the extent of disease. However, up-front, platinum-based chemotherapy represents an appropriate
treatment for asymptomatic patients or for patients
who have achieved symptom control with medical
therapies. For these patients, the timing and the real
need for WBRT remain controversial.
