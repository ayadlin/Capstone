ABSTRACT
Mutational activation of BRAF (BRAFV600E) occurs in pediatric glioma and drives
aberrant MAPK signaling independently of upstream cues. Targeted monotherapy
against BRAFV600E displays efficacy in pre-clinical models of glioma, however xenograft
tumors adapt rapidly and escape from the growth-inhibitory effects of BRAF-targeted
therapy. Here, we show that intrinsic resistance to a BRAFV600E specific inhibitor stems,
in part, from feedback activation of EGFR and downstream signaling pathways.
BRAFV600E inhibition suppresses MAPK signaling, which in turn downregulates the
EGFR phosphatase PTPN9, resulting in sustained EGFR phosphorylation and enhanced
EGFR activity. We demonstrated that overexpression of PTPN9 reduces EGFR
phosphorylation and cooperates with BRAFV600E inhibitor PLX4720 to reduce MAPK and
Akt signaling, resulting in decreased glioma cell viability. Moreover, pharmacologic
inhibition of EGFR combined with inhibition of BRAFV600E to reduce growth of glioma
cell lines and orthotopic glioma xenograft by decreasing tumor cell proliferation while
increasing apoptosis, with resultant significant extension of animal subject survival.
Our data support clinical evaluation of BRAFV600E and EGFR targeted therapy in treating
BRAFV600E glioma.

[1]. Among the three RAF isoforms, BRAF is the most
potent activator of MEK, and thus has greater oncogenic
potential [2]. Aberrant MAPK signaling contributes to at
least a third of all cancers [1].
Ninety percent of BRAF mutations substitute
glutamic acid for valine at position 600 of BRAF protein,
resulting in constitutive kinase activity [3]. Oncogenic
BRAFV600E occurs in 50% of metastatic melanomas,
45% of advanced thyroid cancers and in a smaller but
substantial number of lung, colorectal, ovarian and
brain tumors [3–5]. BRAFV600E mutation is found in 10–
67% of pediatric gliomas depending on histopathologic
subclassification, and is found less commonly in adult

INTRODUCTION
Signaling through mitogen activated protein kinase
(MAPK) influences fundamental cellular processes
including growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration
and apoptosis. MAPK signaling is commonly associated
with activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, which in
turn and sequentially activate the RAS GTPase, and the
RAF kinases (ARAF, BRAF and CRAF). Membrane
bound RAF signals through MAP kinase kinases (MEK1
and MEK2) to activate the extracellular signal-regulated
kinases (ERK1 and ERK2), which activate downstream
transcription factors to drive malignant progression

gliomas [6–8] (Supplementary Table 1). Vemurafenib
and dabrafenib, BRAFV600E selective inhibitors, are FDAapproved for melanoma therapy [9].
We showed previously that the vemurafenib
tool compound, PLX4720, decreased tumor growth
and increased survival in animals carrying orthotopic
xenografts of BRAFV600E-mutant glioma [6]. In addition,
Bautista et al reported partial and transient response to
vemurafenib in two out of three pediatric patients with
high grade glioma [10], and Robinson et al reported a
case of complete regression for recurrent BRAFV600E
pediatric giloblastoma multiforme [11]. In combination,
preclinical and clinical results have led to an ongoing
clinical trial using vemurafenib for treating BRAFV600E
glioma (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01748149).
Importantly, our preclinical studies using BRAF inhibitor
monotherapy revealed that growth inhibition of BRAFV600E
glioma was not durable. Here, we investigated the bases
for this resistance.
Several lines of evidence indicate that receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation may occur in response
to BRAFV600E inhibition [12, 13]. In cancers where RTK
signaling is not prominent, such as melanoma, sensitivity
to BRAFV600E inhibition can be quite pronounced,
suggesting that RTK-based feedback activation may occur
more commonly in cancers for which RTK signaling is
known to play a prominent role.
Here we test the hypothesis that intrinsic resistance
of glioma cells to BRAFV600E inhibitor PLX4720 is due
to feedback activation of EGFR and its downstream
signaling pathways. In contrast to either monothereapy,
combined inhibition of BRAFV600E and EGFR, both in
vivo and in vitro, resulted in efficient silencing of the
MAPK pathway, reflected by reduced tumor growth in and
extended survival of animal subjects bearing BRAFV600E
glioma xenografts. Our data suggests that BRAFV600E and
EGFR combination therapy should be considered for
clinical evaluation in BRAFV600E glioma.

tumor cells from subcutaneous xenografts for transfer
to the intracranial compartment, have been previously
described [15].
PLX4720 was provided by Plexxikon Inc
(Berkeley, CA, USA) and HKI-272 (Niratinib) was
purchased from TSZ Scientific LLC (MA, USA). For in
vitro study, PLX4720 and HKI-272 were dissolved in
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 10 mM. For administration
to animal subjects, PLX4720 was dissolved in DMSO/
PBS (1:1) at the concentration of 5 g/L, whereas HKI-272
was dissolved in 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and
0.2% Tween 80 at a concentration of 8 g/L.

Cell culture and transfection
All cell lines were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin
and streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acid. For
EGFR knock down experiment, cells were transfected
with Dharmacon siGENOME non-target siRNA or
EGFR SMARTpool siRNA following manufacturers
instruction (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA). For PTPN9
overexpression, cells were transfected with PTPN9 in the
pCMV6-AC-GFP plasmid (Origene, MD, USA) using
the Amaza Basic Glial Cells Nucleofector Kit (Lonza,
Germany) following manufacturers instructions.

Subcutaneous xenograft
BT-40 pilocytic astrocytoma chunks were
subcutaneously implanted into the right flanked of eight
week old female non-SCID mice (C.B-17 background,
Taconic Farms, Inc). These mice were then randomized
to four groups receiving treatment of vehicle control
(dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by intraperitonial injection
and 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose plus 0.2% Tween
80 by oral gavage), PLX720 (10 mg/kg) alone, HKI-272
(40 mg/kg) alone, or a combination of PLX4720 and HKI272. PLX4720 was administered by daily intraperitonial
injection whereas HKI-272 treatment was carried out by
daily oral gavage. All treatments were initiated when tumor
volume reached at 100 mm3. The greatest longitudinal
diameter (length) and the greatest transverse diameter
(width) of tumors were measured by caliper every second
day, and tumor volume was calculated using the equation
½ × (length × width2) [16]. Mice were monitored daily
and euthanized upon significant tumor burden (length
>  20  mm), weight loss > 15%, or symptoms related to
tumor burden, such as skin ulcer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell source and investigational agents
Melanoma cell lines (A375, WM793) were
obtained from Dr. Martin McMahon (UCSF); GMB
cell lines AM38, DBTRG-05MG and NMC-G1 were
obtained from ATCC and the Japanese Tumor Cell Bank
Repository. All cell sources were authenticated through
DNA fingerprinting using the Promega Powerplex
plateform. BT40 pilocytic astrocytoma xenografts were
collected under material transfer agreement from Dr
Peter Houghton, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, USA.
DBTRG-05MG cells used for intracranial xenografting
were modified by lentiviral infection for stable expression
of firefly luciferase to allow in vivo bioluminescence
imaging [14]. Specific procedures for the preparation of

Cell viability assay

mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of
ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and then
were injected with 3 μL of DBTRG-FL cell suspension
(3 × 105 cells total) into the right caudate putamen [15].

Cells were seeded onto 48-well plates at 2500
to 3000 cells per well. After 16 hours of seeding, cells
were treated with PLX4720 and/or HKI-272 for 3 days.
Cell viability was determined by WST-1 assay (Roche)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. 450 nm
absorbance was measured using a microplate reader (Gen5,
BioTek), with background reading at 800 nm subtracted.

Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of intracranial
tumor growth
In preparation for BLI, mice were anesthetized
with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg)
followed by intraperitoneal inijection of 150 mg/kg of
luciferin (D-luciferin potassium salt; Gold Biotechnology,
St. Louis, MO). Ten minutes post- luciferin injection,
tumor bioluminescence level was measured using an IVIS
Lumina imaging station (Caliper Life Sciences, Alameda,
CA). Regions of interest, defined by the Living Image
software (Caliper Life Sciences, Alameda, CA), were
recorded as photons per second per steradian per square
centimeter. Mice were imaged twice weekly one week
post- intracranial tumor cell injection.

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were treated with or without drugs for 24
hours before cell cycle analysis. The trypsinized cells
were washed with PBS and fixed with ice-cold 70%
ethanol overnight followed by staining with propidium
iodide (20 μg/ml) in PBS containing RNaseA (0.4 mg/ml)
(Invitrogen). Fluorescence levels (488nm excitation) were
measured by FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson), and data
was analyzed using the ModFit software (Verity).

Immunoblotting analysis

Statistical analysis

Proteins were extracted from cells and tissues using
cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) supplemented with
proteinase (Roche) and phosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Roche). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE
and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes,
which was then probed with primary antibodies followed
by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody,
and visualized by ECL (Pierce). Antibodies specific for
p-MEK 1/2, total MEK 1/2, p-ERK, p-AKT (Ser473),
total AKT, PTPN9, and beta-actin were obtained from
Cell Signaling Technologies. Total EGFR and total
ERK antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Antibody specific for p-EGFR (1173) was
obtained from Novus Biologicals, and antibodies specific
for Beta-Tubulin was from Milipore.

All statistical analysis was performed using PRISM
5, version 5.03 (GraphPad Software). For survival
analysis, a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was employed
to determine the significance. Animals that died during
anesthesia or oral gavages were excluded from survival
analyses. A 2-tailed unpaired t-test was applied for all
other statistical analyses.

RESULTS
EGFR is highly expressed and activated in
glioma cells
EGFR expression and signaling is known to be
important to the pathobiology of malignant glioma [17].
We compared EGFR expression and activation in human
glioma cell lines, and in relation to several melanoma
cell lines representative of a cancer in which RTK
signaling is not prominent. Both total and phosphorylated
EGFR were expressed at consistently higher levels in
glioma as compared with melanoma cells (Figure 1 and
Supplementary Figure 1). Genetic characteristics of the
cell lines tested are described in Supplementary Table 2.

Immunohistochemistry
Resected mouse brains were fixed in 10% buffered
formalin, then paraffin-embedded and sectioned for
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. To determine Ki-67 reactivity,
unstained sections were processed with a Ventana
BenchMark XT automated system followed by antigen
retrieval that involves a 30 min incubation in Cell
Conditioning Solution (CC1) (Ventana Medical Systems)
at 92°C. The slides were then stained with anti- Ki-67
(Ventana) antibody for 16 min at 37°C. Ki-67 positive
cells were counted in 10 high-powered fields within the
tumor, with percent positive cells averaged for all fields
associated with a specific drug treatment and subjected to
statistical analysis as described below.

bearing a BRAFV600E heterozygous mutant pediatric glioma,
BT40, with BRAFV600E specific inhibitor PLX4720 (10 mg/
kg), EGFR inhibitor HKI-272 (40 mg/kg), or a combination
of PLX4720 (10 mg/kg) and HKI-272 (40 mg/kg) for 14
days. Mice receiving PLX4720 and HKI-272 monotherapy
showed reduced tumor growth compared to the vehicle
control, although no significant benefit was observed in
survival (defined by sacrifice of mice required upon tumors
reaching maximum tumor burden defined by our animal
use protocol) (Figure 2A and 2B). Co-administration of
PLX4720 and HKI-272 resulted in a striking regression of
tumor volume, with nearly complete regression observed in
several mice receiving combination treatment (Figure 2A).
As expected, the dramatic reduction in tumor size resulted
in significant survival benefit for mice receiving combination
treatment (Figure 2B). A wildtype BRAF model was excluded
from our analyses as it has been shown that in contrast to
BRAFV600E cells, PLX4720 promotes wildtype BRAF glioma
growth due to transactivation of wild type BRAF [18].
We next analyzed BT40 xenografts obtained from
mice following just three days of treatment for molecular
indicators of response to mono- and combination therapy.
Immunohistochemical analysis of tumors from mice
treated with PLX4720 and HKI-272 showed significantly
less positivity for the proliferation marker Ki67
(Figure 2C), compared to vehicle or monotherapy groups.
Immunoblotting of protein extracted from frozen portions
of the same tumors revealed that PLX4720 monotherapy
group had elevated levels of EGFR phosphorylation
relative to EGFR phosphorylation in tumors from any
other treatment group, suggesting that EGFR is activated
by BRAFV600E inhibition (Figure 2D). Since both EGFR
and BRAF can drive MAPK signaling, we next analyzed
MAPK activation. PLX4720 and HKI-272 co-treated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tumors had low levels of MEK and ERK phosphorylation
as compared to monotherapy controls (Figure 2D).
Molecular indication of anti-tumor activity for either
monotherapy was supported by reduced MEK/ERK and/
or EGFR phosphorylation in PLX4720 and HKI-272
treated groups. Phospho-Akt was undetectable in any of the
tumor samples (data not shown). PLX4720 and HKI-272
concentrations in BT40 subcutaneous xenografts receiving
combination treatment were determined as 43.73 ± 17.43
μM and 2.02 ± 0.39 μM, respectively, and both of these
well-exceed published in vitro kinase assay IC50 values
for PLX4720 (13 nM) against BRAFV600E, and HKI-272 (92
nM) against EGFR [19, 20]. Interestingly, while the tumor
PLX4720 concentration in the monotherapy group (36.32
± 13.16 μM) resembles those from the animals treated
with a combination of PLX4720 and HKI-272 (p = 0.34),
tumor HKI-272 concentration was significantly higher in
the combination treatment group compared to the HKI272 alone group (1.54 ± 0.03 μM) (p = 0.036), suggesting
an enhanced uptake of HKI-272 when administered in
combination with PLX4720. Although the associated
mechanism for increased uptake is yet to be determined,
the drug concentration results were consistent with the
analysis of EGFR phosphorylation, which showed a more
substantial inhibition of phosphorylation when cells were
co-treated with HKI-272 and PLX4720 (Figure 2D).

PLX4720 induces feedback activation of EGFR
and its downstream signaling

EGFR knock down prevents PLX4720 induced
MAPK activation and cooperates with PLX4720
to induce cell viability loss

We examined whether EGFR feedback activation by
BRAFV600E inhibition was evident in vitro, by treating three
BRAFV600E glioma cell lines (BRAFV600E homozygous line
AM38 and BRAFV600E heterozygous lines DBTRG-05MG
and NMC-G1) with 5 μM PLX4720, 1 μM HKI-272 or a
combination of both drugs. PLX4720 treatment increased
EGFR phosphorylation, and also activated downstream
effectors MEK and ERK, in all three BRAFV600E glioma
cell lines, as early as 1 hour post-PLX4720 treatment
(Figure 4A). A profound increase in Akt phosphorylation
was observed in NMC-G1 cells treated with PLX4720.
The activation of EGFR signals through RAS and C-Raf
to activate MEK and ERK, as shown by elevated levels
of RAS-GTP and p-C-Raf following BRAF inhibition
(Supplementary Figure 2). Combining HKI-272 with
PLX4720 prevented increased phosphorylation of MEK,
ERK and Akt in all lines (Figure 4A). Similar inhibitor
effects, on signaling mediator phosphorylation, were
observed irrespective of cell stimulation by addition of
serum (Figure 4A) or by EGF (Supplementary Figure 2).

HKI-272 is an irreversible pan-HER receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor whose use, in the context of the
present study, raises the question of whether HKI-272
effects are due to the inhibition of EGFR only, or is due to
combined HER family member inhibition. To address the
importance of EGFR inhibition to the effects of HKI-272,
we used siRNA knockdown to suppress EGFR expression
in AM38 and DBTRG-05MG cells, and then examined
siRNA-treated cell response to BRAFV600E pharmacologic
inhibition. AM38 and DBTRG-05MG cells treated with
scrambled siRNA showed a significant increase in ERK
phosphorylation after 6 hours of PLX4720 treatment
(Figure 5A). Increased MAPK activation, following
treatment with PLX4720, was almost completely blocked
by EGFR knock down (Figure 5A). A similar, albeit less
pronounced effect was observed for Akt activation.
EGFR siRNA treatment, both with and without
PLX4720, decreased cell viability. In the absence of
PLX4720, EGFR knock down resulted in 20–30% cell
viability loss compared to control siRNA treatment
(Figure 5B). Further reduction in cell viability was observed
by BRAFV600E inhibition. In the presence of 1 μM PLX4720,
EGFR knock down caused 60% and 80% viability loss in
AM38 and DBTRG-05MG cells, respectively.

EGFR inhibitor HKI-272 cooperates with PLX4720
to induce cell cycle arrest and viability loss
To investigate if suppression of EGFR feedback
activation in PLX4720 treated cells affects cell cycle
progression and viability, we treated AM38 and DBTRG05MG cells with 5 μM PLX4720, 1 μM HKI-272, or a
combination of both drugs, and measured cell cycle
distributions by propidium iodine incorporation, cell
viability by WST-1 assay, and apoptosis by annexin V
staining. After 24 hours of drug treatment, PLX4720
induced a substantial accumulation of G1 phase cell
population compared to DMSO control (DMSO vs
PLX4720 treatment: AM38 p = 0.001; DBTRG-05MG
p = 0.0003). Inclusion of HKI-272 with PLX4720 further
increased G1 arrest in DBTRG-05MG cells (PLX4720
vs combination, p = 0.02) (Figure 4B). G1 phase cell
cycle arrest was accompanied by increased apoptosis
and decreased cell viability from PLX4720 + HKI-272
co-treatment. Combined treatment with PLX4720 and
HKI-272 induced significant apoptosis in both AM38
and DBTRG-05MG cells, in relation to DMSO treatment
(DMSO vs combination treatment in AM38, p < 0.001;
in DBTRG, p = 0.046) (Figure 4C). Consistent with the
apoptosis results, following 72 hours of drug exposure,
PLX4720 treatment caused a significant reduction in
cell viability compared to vehicle control. Cell viability
was further diminished by the inclusion of HKI-272
with PLX4720 (Figure 4D). The effect of HKI-272 on
PLX4720-associated cell viability was masked due to the
potency of HKI-272 when used at a concentration > 0.5
μM in DBTRG-05MG cells.

Hyperactivation of EGFR upon BRAFV600E
inhibition coincident with PTPN9
downregulation
To define the basis of EGFR feedback activation by
PLX4720, we compared the gene expression of known
EGFR phosphatases in AM38 and DBTRG cells treated
with DMSO or PLX4720 for 12 hours (Supplementary
Table 3). Among the genes whose expression was
significantly decreased by PLX4720 treatment, the
transcript for protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN9
was of particular interest because of its known EGFR
inhibitory activity [21]. Also, PTPN9 is the only candidate
phosphatase for which we could readily observe protein
down-regulation upon PLX4720 treatment (Figure 6A,
Supplementary Figure 3). Additional support for the
importance of PTPN9 in the pathobiology of BRAFV600E
glioma stems from the observation of a two-fold increase
in PTPN9 expression in BRAFV600E pediatric astrocytoma
(n = 5) relative to BRAF wildtype tumors (n = 29)
(p = 0.001), according to the microarray data described in
Schiffman et al [7] (Supplementary Figure 4).
To extend the analysis of PLX4720 effects on PTPN9
expression, and to determine if this influences EGFR activity,
we compared PTPN9 protein expression and EGFR signaling
in PLX4720 treated versus untreated cells. Twenty-four hour
treatments with PLX4720 reduced PTPN9 expression in each

NMC-G1, AM38 and DBTRG-05MG were subjected to a 24 hour time course treatment with 5 μM PLX4720 in the presence or absence
of 1 μM HKI-272. These cells were serum starved for 16 hours before being stimulated with 10% FBS and harvested for immunoblotting
analysis. Cells treated with PLX4720 alone showed an initial suppression of MEK and ERK phosphorylation followed by a profound
rebound of MAPK pathway activation as early as one hour post-PLX4720 treatment. Elevated levels of EGFR phosphorylation were also
observed in the PLX4720 treated cells. The extent of Akt phosphorylation increased upon PLX4720 treatment, although the extent varies
between cell lines. In contrast, no reactivation of EGFR, MEK, ERK or Akt was observed in cells pre-treated with HKI-272. B. AM38 and
DBTRG-05MG cells were treated with 1 μM HKI-272 and/or 5 μM PLX4720 as indicated for 24 hours before being subjected to cell cycle
analysis by propidium iodide staining. Combined EGFR and BRAFV600E inhibition results in elevated G1 phase population (AM38 p = 0.001;
DBTRG-05MG p = 0.0003). C. Cells were treated with 1 μM HKI-272 and/or 5 μM PLX4720 as indicated for 72 hours. Apoptosis was
determined by annexin V staining. In both AM38 and DBTRG-05MG cells, HKI-272 treatment alone elicited profound apoptosis (p value
DMSO vs HKI-272 in AM38 = 7.01E-6; in DBTRG-05MG = 0.02) such that no significant additive effect was observed when combined
HKI-272 with PLX4720 (p value HKI-272 vs combo in AM38 = 0.416; in DBTRG-05MG = 0.07). D. Cells were treated 0 (grey bar) or
5 μM (black bar) PLX4720 in the presence of a titration of HKI-272 for 48 hours. Cells viability was measured by WST-1 assay. PLX4720
treatment alone reduced cell viability to approximately 80%. The cell viability loss was further augmented by HKI-272 treatment.

of three BRAFV600E cell lines, AM38, DBTRG-05MG and
NMC-G1 (Figure 6A, Supplementary Figure 3), and increased
EGFR phosphorylation. Conversely, overexpression of PTPN9
in these cells markedly reduced EGFR phosphorylation and
suppressed MAPK and Akt signaling. PTPN9 overexpression
cooperates with PLX4720, causing further silencing of the
MAPK and Akt pathways in a similar fashion as observed in
EGFR inhibitor HKI-272 or siRNA treated cells.
Furthermore, overexpression of PTPN9 cooperates
with PLX4720 to reduce cell viability. PTPN9 expression
alone significantly impaired AM38 (p = 0.019) and
DBTRG (p = 0.004) cell viability. The viability loss was
further augmented by PLX4720 treatment (p value vector
vs PTPN9 treated with PLX4720 in AM38 = 0.029; in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

DBTRG-05MG = 0.002). Collectively, these data support
PLX4720 treatment as suppressing PTPN9 expression
that, in turn, results in reduced EGFR dephosphorylation
and thus enhanced EGFR activity.

DISCUSSION
BRAFV600E targeted therapy has attracted substantial
interest for treating multiple types of cancer, including
glioma, due to druggable BRAFV600E kinase activity.
However, the extent of tumor response to BRAFV600E
inhibitor mono-therapy is likely influenced by cell/tissue
of origin and corresponding molecular characteristics.
In melanoma, BRAFV600E inhibition results in relatively

A. AM38 cells were treated with scramble control or EGFR siRNA for 4 hours followed by 5 μM PLX4720 for the period as indicated. Cells
were serum starved for 16 hours before being stimulated with 5 nM EGF for 10 min. Rebound of ERK and Akt activation was observed
in control, but not in EGFR siRNA treated cells. B. Scramble control (grey bar) or EGFR (black bar) siRNA treated AM38 and DBTRG05MG cells were exposed to 5 μM PLX4720 for 72 hours. Cell viability was measured by WST-1 assay. Cell viability loss induced by
PLX4720 was more profound in EGFR knocked down cells compared to control siRNA treated cells.

profound and sustainable ERK inhibition in relation
to thyroid or colon cancer [12, 22, 23]. The response
of melanoma may be attributable, at least in part, to its
limited ability to activate receptor tyrosine kinases when
subjected to BRAFV600E inhibition. In thyroid cancer
cells, resistance to BRAFV600E inhibitors is largely due to
activation of HER3 signaling, as supported by the effect
of HER kinase inhibitor lapatinib which prevents MAPK
signaling recovery, and sensitizes thyroid cancer cells
to RAF inhibitors [12]. In colon cancer cells blockade
of EGFR by the antibody cetuximab or by EGFR small
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

molecule inhibitors such as gefitinib or erlotinib proves
strongly synergistic with BRAFV600E inhibition in
suppressing MAPK signaling and reducing cell viability
[13]. Here, we showed that in adult and pediatric glioma
cells, inhibition of BRAFV600E results in feedback activation
of EGFR that reduces the extent and duration of MAPK
pathway inhibition. We further demonstrated that genetic
and pharmacological inhibition of EGFR cooperates with
PLX4720 in efficient blockade of the MAPK and Akt
pathways, resulting in induction of G1 phase cell cycle
arrest and loss of cell viability. The combined effect of

Figure 6: Downregulation of PTPN9 upon PLX4720 treatment correlates with increased EGFR phosphorylation in
BRAFV600E glioma cells. A. AM38 and DBTRG-05MG were transfected with vector or PTPN9 for 24 hours before being treated with

5 μM PLX4720 for 16 hours under serum starved condition. Cells were then stimulated with 5 nM EGF for 15 min before being analyzed for
EGFR pathway activation and PTPN9 expression by immunoblotting. Downregulation of the EGFR phosphatase PTPN9 was observed in
both cell lines examined when treated with PLX4720, and the level inversely correlates with extent of EGFR phosphorylation. Compared to
vector control, PTPN9 overexrpessing cells showed a marked reduction in EGFR phosphorylation and decreased signaling through MAPK
and Akt. B. Vector or PTPN9 transfected cells were treated with 5 μM PLX4720 for 48 hours. Cell viability was measured by a WST-1 assay.
PTPN9 overexpression significantly impaired cell viability in AM38 (p = 0.019) and DBTRG-05MG cells (p = 0.004). Such viability lost was
further augmented by PLX4720 treatment (p value vector vs PTPN9 treated with PLX4720 in AM38 = 0.029; in DBTRG-05MG = 0.002).
C. Schematic representation of intrinsic resistance mechanism to PLX4720 in BRAFV600E glioma. (I) Strong BRAFV600E induced MAPK
signaling supports PTPN9 expression, which dephosphorylates and hence inactivates EGFR. (II) MAPK pathway inhibition suppresses
PTPN9 expression, resulting in reduced dephosphorylation and therefore activation of EGFR. (III) Overtime, cells reach a new equilibrium
where despite lack of BRAFV600E driven signaling, restoration of EGFR activation leads to re-engagement of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways.

EGFR and BRAFV600E inhibition is also reflected in our
in vivo BRAFV600E xenograft models. Mice treated with a
combination of BRAFV600E and EGFR inhibitors showed
dramatic reduction in tumor growth and extended survival
compared to vehicle or single drug treated counterparts.
More profound survival benefit would be expected with
extended courses of drug treatment, which we are actively
pursuing. Collectively, these data support BRAFV600E and
EGFR combination therapy as an approach for treating
BRAFV600E glioma.
We have shown that downregulation of the
EGFR phosphatase PTPN9 upon BRAFV600E inhibition
is associated with increased EGFR activation [21].
Conversely, we showed that overexpression of PTPN9
reduces EGFR phosphorylation and cooperates with
PLX4720 to reduce MAPK and Akt signaling, resulting
in cell viability loss. These data argue that BRAFV600E
inhibition suppresses MAPK signaling, which in turn
downregulates PTPN9, resulting in sustained EGFR
phosphorylation and enhanced EGFR activity (Figure
6C). Further supporting this hypothesis is the two-fold
upregulation of PTPN9 expression in BRAFV600E pediatric
astrocytoma compared to BRAF wildtype counterparts
(p = 0.001) [7]. While our data do not exclude the
involvement of other phosphatases in this MAPK/EGFR
feedback mechanism, our observations are distinct from
those observed in epithelial cancers. In melanoma cells,
ERK rebound upon BRAFV600E inhibition may be due to
reduction of the ERK phosphatase DUSP6 and receptor
tyrosine kinase blocker Spry2, which sequesters the
Grb2:SOS complex, preventing the binding of receptor
tyrosine kinase [23]. In colon cancer cells, initial reduction
in ERK signaling by BRAFV600E inhibitor treatment
decreases the phosphatase activity of CDC25C, which
in turn results in elevated EGFR phosphorylation [22].
In thyroid cancer cells, rebound of ERK signaling upon
BRAFV600E treatment may be caused by downregualtion of
ERK phosphatase DUSP5 and increased HER3 expression
[12]. PTPN9 overexpression per se reduces glioma cell
proliferation in the absence of BRAF inhibition in our
experiments (Figure 6), indicating that PTPN9 may
have a global tumor suppressive role. PTPN9 is known
to dephosphorylate HER2, STAT3, and VEGFR2, in
addition to EGFR, and it’s expression is normally tightly
regulated [24–26]. Interestingly, inactivating mutations or
recurrent chromosomal deletions incorporating PTPN9 in
GBM are not found in the TCGA database via cBioPortal,
which suggests that PTPN9 might not be a common tumor
suppressor gene in glioma [27].
In 2014, the FDA has approved the use of the MEK
inhibitor trametinib and BRAFV600E inhibitor debrafenib
as combination therapy in BRAFV600E and BRAFV600K
melanoma. Such an approach is logical for melanoma,
in which rebound of MAPK signaling upon BRAFV600E
inhibition is largely mediated through the MAPK pathway.
In glioma cells multiple signaling pathways, including
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

those involving MAPK and PI3K/Akt, are simultaneously
activated by BRAFV600E inhibitor induced feedback
activation of EGFR. Therefore, inhibition of EGFR, and
the multiple mitogenic pathways it stimulates, may prove
to be more efficacious than targeting a single downstream
signaling effector.
EGFR targeted therapy has been disappointing in
glioma despite great effort in developing small molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatanib,
PKI166, neratinib, canertinib, pelitinib), monoclonal
antibodies (cetuximab, panitumumab, nimotuzumab), and
RNA-based agents (siRNA, antisense oligonucleotides
OGX-011) [28]. Similarly, some BRAFV600E monotherapy
attempts in glioma have been discouraging [29]. It is
therefore interesting and significant that combining
EGFR and BRAFV600E therapies may prove an effective
anti-glioma strategy. If this therapeutic approach were
to be used in treating glioma patients, a factor that may
prove critically important in determining its success is
therapeutic access to brain and brain tumor. Here, our
results showed that heightened concentration of HKI272 in subcutaneous tumor, relative to intracranial
tumor, resulted in almost complete subcutaneous tumor
regression when combined with PLX4720. A much lesser
concentration of intracranial HKI-272 likely explains
the more subtle effects on tumor growth and animal
survival in our orthotopic model. The HKI-272/PLX4720
combination therapy outperformed single drug treatments
in our intracranial model despite lower brain HKI-272
concentration than the published IC50 values of HKI272 against EGFR, and also the GI50 values (0.1–1 μM)
determined from our in vitro cell viability assays (Figure
4D). This suggests that partial inhibition of EGFR is
sufficient to contribute to suppression of tumor growth
when BRAFV600E is being inhibited. Most available antiEGFR agents, including HKI-272 used in this study,
have poor blood brain barrier penetrance. In the absence
of EGFR small molecule inhibitors with excellent brain
penetration, it may be necessary to resort to alternative
routes of administration or inhibitor packaging approaches
for achieving sufficiently high tumor concentrations of
inhibitor for patients to benefit from this combination
therapy.
Our study suggests that EGFR and BRAFV600E
combination therapy might be worth investigating in
clinical trial on BRAFV600E glioma, which thus far has
poor clinical prognosis under standard radiation and
chemotherapeutic regimens [30]. The powerful feedback
activation of EGFR induced upon BRAFV600E inhibition
explains the incomplete clinical response to BRAFV600E
monotherapy in early case series. We have shown that
preventing such feedback mechanism by inhibiting EGFR
can effectively reduce tumor growth and prolong animal
survival. Our data also implicates that the expression
and activation levels of EGFR may be a useful clinical
biomarker to predict the response to BRAFV600E targeted

common problem of small molecule based anti-cancer
therapy, we are dedicated to investigating solutions to
prevent or overcome acquired resistance associated with
EGFR and BRAFV600E targeted therapy.
