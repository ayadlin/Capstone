ABSTRACT
FoxM1 is an oncogenic Forkhead transcription factor that is overexpressed
in ovarian cancer. However, the mechanisms by which FoxM1 is deregulated in ovarian
cancer and the extent to which FoxM1 can be targeted in ovarian cancer have not been
reported previously. In this study, we showed that MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 upregulated
p53 protein and downregulated FoxM1 expression in several cancer cell lines with wild
type TP53 but not in cell lines with mutant TP53. FoxM1 downregulation was partially
blocked by cycloheximide or actinomycin D, and pulse-chase studies indicate Nutlin-3
enhances FoxM1 mRNA decay. Knockdown of p53 using shRNAs abrogated the FoxM1
downregulation by Nutlin-3, indicating a p53-dependent mechanism. FoxM1 inhibitor,
thiostrepton, induces apoptosis in cancer cell lines and enhances sensitivity to cisplatin
in these cells. Thiostrepton downregulates FoxM1 expression in several cancer cell
lines and enhances sensitivity to carboplatin in vivo. Finally, FoxM1 expression is
elevated in nearly all (48/49) ovarian tumors, indicating that thiostrepton target gene
is highly expressed in ovarian cancer. In summary, the present study provides novel
evidence that both amorphic and neomorphic mutations in TP53 contribute to FoxM1
overexpression and that FoxM1 may be targeted for therapeutic benefits in cancers.

at the expression level by growth factors [18, 23],
and at the post-translational level by phosphorylation

INTRODUCTION
Forkhead Box M1 (FoxM1), a member of the
Forkhead family of transcription factors, is overexpressed
in the majority of human cancers. It has been found to play
an important role in cancer development by regulating
multiple biological processes such as cell proliferation,
differentiation, survival, and migration [1]. A genome-wide
study reported that FoxM1 mRNA was overexpressed in
most high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas without DNA
copy number changes [2].
Three isoforms of FoxM1 have been identified
to date. FoxM1A, which harbors all of the ten exons of
FoxM1 gene, is transcriptionally inactive. FoxM1B lacks
exons Va and VIIa, while FoxM1C possesses Va but lacks
VIIa; both are transcriptionally active [3]. FoxM1 has been

genes [27]. The importance of p53 in cancer surveillance
and therapeutics has been well studied [28]. Loss of p53
activity inhibits apoptosis and accelerates the appearance
of tumors in transgenic mice [29]. TP53 missense
mutations can inactivate not only the normal function, but
also exert pro-oncogenic effects [30]. Mutations in TP53
are common in human cancers [31], and approximately
95% of high-grade serous ovarian cancer harbor TP53
mutations [2]. Although two studies investigated the
potential role of p53 in the regulation of FoxM1 expression
[12, 13], these studies focused on transcriptional
regulation via E2F or FoxO3. In addition, the results from
these studies are inconsistent, for example Barsotti &
Prives [12] reported that FoxM1 downregulation by p53
is dependent on p21 whereas Millour et al [13] did not find
p21-dependent repression of FoxM1 by p53, suggesting
the need to improve our understanding of the mechanisms
regulating FoxM1 expression by p53 in cancers.
Considering that TP53 mutations and FoxM1
overexpression occur in most ovarian cancer, we were
intrigued to explore the regulation of FoxM1 by p53 in
ovarian cancer cells. p53 protein is tightly regulated by
MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates p53
and promotes p53 degradation [32]. Nutlin-3 is a small
molecule that inhibits p53 degradation by interacting with
the p53-binding pocket of MDM2 and suppressing p53MDM2 interaction [33]. TP53 null cells showed minimal
changes genome-wide expression following Nutlin-3
treatment, indicating that Nutlin-3 is selective for p53
[34, 35]. Therefore, in this study we investigated the
mechanisms of FoxM1 regulation by p53 in cancer cell
lines using Nutlin-3 as a tool.

lines and in OV2008 and OV202 cell lines that failed to
respond to Nutlin-3. These results suggest that FoxM1
suppression by Nutlin-3 may be partly dependent on
functional p53.

Downregulation of FoxM1 protein by Nutlin-3 is
dependent on functional p53 and is attenuated
by cycloheximide and actinomycin D
To explore the mechanisms for Nutlin-3induced downregulation of FoxM1 in cancer cells with
functional p53, we first examined the time-course of
FoxM1 protein expression in A2780 and NCI-H23 and
its association with p53 and p21, a well-known p53
transcription target. A TP53 mutant cell line HEC-1A
was included as a control. As shown in Figure 1B & 1C,
an increase in p53 and p21 protein levels was observed
as early as 3 h post treatment in A2780 and NCI-H23
cells and became more dramatic by 24 h, consistent with
the functional status of p53. FoxM1 levels, however,
were not decreased until 24 h. We then included a
protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) and a
transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (ActD), alone or
in combination with Nutlin-3, in 24 h treatment groups
to help decipher the mechanism. CHX treatment alone
for 24 h decreased p53 protein expression in A2780 and
NCI-H23 cells as compared to controls. CHX + Nutlin-3
combination treatment resulted in minimal increased
p53 protein levels as compared to CHX alone, indicating
that Nutlin-3 increases p53 protein stability, which is in
agreement with the literature [35, 40]. FoxM1 protein
levels in these cells were decreased by CHX treatment
as well. Co-treatment with Nutlin-3 did not lead to
further decrease in FoxM1 protein levels, indicating
that downregulation of FoxM1 by Nutlin-3 is not due to
decreased protein stability.
Interestingly, ActD, alone or in combination with
Nutlin-3, was able to increase p53 protein levels in A2780
and NCI-H23 cells without a marked decrease in FoxM1
protein expression levels, suggesting the possibility that
FoxM1 downregulation requires de novo transcription.
Upregulation of p53 protein expression in ActD-treated
cells is not unexpected because p53 expression is
regulated at the post-transcriptional level by MDM2mediated ubiquitination and degradation [41, 42]. We
also observed that FoxM1 protein levels were lower in
Nutlin-3-treated group as compared to CHX + Nutlin-3
or ActD + Nutlin-3 groups in both A2780 and NCI-H23
cells, indicating that downregulation of FoxM1 protein
by Nutlin-3 can be partially blocked by either CHX or
ActD. p21 protein levels became undetectable following
treatment with CHX or ActD in A2780 and NCI-H23
cells, further corroborating the inhibitory effect of CHX
and ActD on de novo translation and transcription,

RESULTS
Nutlin-3 upregulates p53 and downregulates
FoxM1 protein in cancer cells with wild
type TP53
To begin to understand the regulation of FoxM1
by p53 in cancer cells, we first examined the effects of
MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 on the expression of p53 and
FoxM1 proteins in several cancer cell lines with either
wild-type or mutant TP53 (Figure 1A). We observed that
Nutlin-3 treatment for 21h resulted in an increase in p53
protein levels in OVCAR10, NCI-H23 and A2780 cells
that have functional TP53, but not in cell lines with known
TP53 mutations (SKOV3 [36], OVCAR8 [37], and PE01
[38], HEC-1A[39]) and nor in cell lines (OV2008, OV202)
where p53 dysfunction was suspected (Figure 1A).
Variable basal expression of FoxM1 protein was detected
in all cell lines tested, and a decrease in FoxM1 levels was
observed in association with p53 upregulation by Nutlin-3.
FoxM1 levels remained unchanged in TP53 mutant cell

Downregulation of FoxM1 mRNA by Nutlin-3 is
dependent on functional p53 and is blocked by

respectively. Nutlin-3 did not significantly alter p53
or FoxM1 protein expression in HEC-1A cells with
mutant TP53 (Figure 1D). p21 protein expression was
undetectable in HEC-1A cells throughout treatment. These
results further suggest the role of functional p53 in FoxM1
suppression.

To examine the extent to which FoxM1
suppression by Nutlin-3 is attributed to decreased FoxM1

Figure 1: Functional p53 is required for FoxM1 suppression by Nutlin-3. (A) In cell lines with functional p53, p53 expression
is induced, and FoxM1 expression is suppressed by Nutlin-3. Cell lines with known TP53 mutations are indicated by “mt” and wild type cell
lines are indicated by “wt”. Note, although OVCAR10 contains a mutant allele (V172F), p53 expression is induced, and FoxM1 expression
is suppressed by Nutlin-3, suggesting the wild type copy is sufficient to suppress FoxM1 expression. Significant down-regulation of FoxM1
was observed in NCI-H23 (**, P ≤ 0.01) and A2780 (*, P ≤ 0.05). FoxM1 expression was normalized with β-actin and was expressed
relative to DMSO-treated controls.

Figure 1 (Continued ): (B-D) Time-course experiments indicate that p53 is induced within 3 hours of Nutlin-3 treatment in A2780

and NCI-H23 cells with wild type p53, and FoxM1 downregulation is observed at 24 hours in these cells. In HEC-1A cells with mutant
p53, neither p53 nor FoxM1 was affected by Nutlin-3 at various time points. These results indicate functional p53 is required for FoxM1
downregulation by Nutlin-3. Cells were treated with vehicle (0.05% DMSO), 10 μM Nutlin-3 for 3, 6 or 24 h, or with CHX, CHX+Nutlin-3,
ActD or ActD+Nutlin-3 for 24 h. Proteins were isolated and subjected to Western analysis. β-actin was used for normalization of loading.

steady-state mRNA levels and to investigate the
mechanism of regulation, A2780, NCI-H23, and HEC-1A
cells were treated with or without Nutlin-3 for 3, 6, or 24 h,
and FoxM1 expression was analyzed using real-time
RT-PCR. In accordance with the Western data, FoxM1
mRNA levels remained unaltered at 3 h and 6 h, but were
significantly decreased by 24 h in both cell lines with
functional p53 (Figure 2A & 2B). In HEC-1A cells,
FoxM1 mRNA levels did not significantly change across
the time points following Nutlin-3 treatment (Figure 2C).
Further analysis showed that downregulation of
FoxM1 mRNA levels by Nutlin-3 could be completely
blocked by either CHX or ActD in both A2780 and
NCI-H23 cells, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis
was involved in the downregulation of FoxM1 by Nutlin-3
(Figure 2D & 2E). ActD alone for 24 h did not lead to
a significant decrease in FoxM1 mRNA levels, which
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggests that FoxM1 mRNA is relatively stable, as least
in the presence of ActD in cells with wild type p53
(Figure 2D & 2E). Interestingly, in HEC-1A cells with
mutant p53, ActD significantly downregulates FoxM1
mRNA levels (Figure 2F), suggesting that mutant p53
may have different effect on FoxM1 expression. We
also examined the expression of three FoxM1 isoforms
separately (Figure S1-S3), and observed results similar to
total FoxM1 expression.

Nutlin-3 reduces FoxM1 mRNA stability
To test if Nutlin-3 treatment alters FoxM1 mRNA
stability, we quantified FoxM1 total mRNA levels in cells
treated with or without Nutlin-3 for 14 hours, followed by
ActD treatment for variable duration. cMyc mRNA was
used as a positive control. We observed a rapid decay of
11368

cMyc mRNA following the transcription inhibition by
ActD. The half-life of cMyc mRNA was estimated to be
approximately 40 minutes (Figure 2G). In contrast, the
half-life of FoxM1 mRNA in cells treated with Nutlin-3
was estimated to be approximately 400 minutes while the
half-life of FoxM1 mRNA in cells treated with DMSO was
unavailable due to lack of mRNA decay within the test
time frame. These results further support our hypothesis
that Nutlin-3 enhances FoxM1 mRNA decay.
Because we observed that FoxM1 mRNA
downregulation was partially blocked by actinomycin D,
suggesting that de novo transcription is required, we were
concerned that actinomycin D treatment during FoxM1
mRNA decay analysis may cause artificial stability of
FoxM1 mRNA and may produce spurious half-life data.
We, therefore, applied an alternative method of ClickIt EU labeling that does not require ActD treatment to
determine the decay. Moreover, this method can also be
used to determine nascent mRNA synthesis after Nutlin-3
treatment. We first determined the extent to which Nutlin-3
treatment affected nascent FoxM1 mRNA synthesis.
We treated A2780 cells with Nutlin-3 for either 2 hours
or 5 hours, followed by 1 hour pulse labeling with ClickIt EU nucleotide. We then performed Click-It chemistry
to biotinylate nascent mRNA that were subsequently
purified through streptavidin beads. Quantitative RT-PCR
analysis of nascent mRNAs from these samples indicates
that Nutlin-3 treatment did not inhibit FoxM1 transcription
(Figure 2H). In fact, we observed an increase in FoxM1
transcription at 5 hours of Nutlin-3 treatment.
We next determined the FoxM1 mRNA decay
rate in A2780 cells pretreated for 5 hours with Nutlin-3,
followed by 1 hour pulse-labeling with Click-IT EU, and
chased for various time-points after washout. Quantitative
RT-PCR analysis indicates fast rate of FoxM1 mRNA
decay in cells treated with Nutlin-3 (t½ = 2.7 hours)
compared to cells treated with DMSO (t½ = 6.7 hours)
(Figure 2I). It should be noted that the half-life of FoxM1
mRNA in Nutlin-3 treated cells with ActD chase was
estimated as approximately 6.5 hours and differed from
the estimate obtained from Click-IT EU label and chase
experiment. The difference is likely due to ActD blocking
de novo transcription of secondary factor(s) that regulates
FoxM1 mRNA stability.

shRNA-1 (P1) or p53 shRNA-2 (P2) resulted in increased
expression of FoxM1 protein in both A2780 and NCI-H23
cells as compared to NTC. To our surprise, knockdown of
p53 in TP53 mutant HEC-1A cells resulted in a decreased
in FoxM1 protein levels, suggesting the possibility that
mutant TP53 in HEC-1A positively regulates FoxM1
expression. In contrast, the knockdown of S241F mutant
in ES2 cells resulted in upregulation of FoxM1. These
results highlight the heterogeneity in the regulation of
FoxM1 by p53 mutants, with S241F mutant still retaining
the negative regulatory effect on FoxM1 expression
while TP53 mutant R248Q acquires the gain of positive
regulatory effect on FoxM1 expression.
Next, we treated the A2780 and NCI-H23 cells,
expressing NTC or p53-targeting shRNAs, with or
without Nutlin-3 for 24 h and analyzed the expression of
p53 and FoxM1 proteins by Western blots. As expected,
knockdown of p53 attenuated p53 induction by Nutlin-3
and partially blocked the effects of FoxM1 downregulation
(Figure 3B). To confirm that this is attributed to regulation
at the mRNA level, cells with the same treatment were
subjected to real-time RT PCR analysis. Consistent
with the Western data, knockdown of p53 in A2780 and
NCI-H23 cells blocked the downregulation of FoxM1
mRNA levels by Nutlin-3 (Figure 3C & 3D), indicating
that functional p53 is necessary for Nutlin-3-induced
FoxM1 downregulation.

FoxM1 inhibitor, thiostrepton, downregulates
FoxM1 expression and induces apoptosis in
cancer cell lines
To assess the potential of FoxM1 as a therapeutic
target, we treated gynecologic cancer cell lines with
FoxM1 inhibitor, thiostrepton. Previous studies indicated
that thiostrepton inhibits FoxM1 transcription factor
activity and consequently downregulates FoxM1
expression [43–45]. Consistent with these results, we
observed downregulation of FoxM1 by thiostrepton in
several ovarian cancer cell lines (Figure 4A & 4B and
Figure S4). Thiostrepton induces apoptosis in these cell
lines as evidenced by the cleavage of caspase-3 and
PARP1 (Figure 4C & 4D). Since we observed apoptotic
morphology in A2780 and HEC-1A within 24 h and 48 h
respectively (data not shown), we used these time points to
quantify apoptosis in these cells using Annexin V labeling.
The results, shown in Figure 4E & 4F and Figure S5A &
S5B, indicate cancer cells underwent apoptosis following
thiostrepton treatment.

Knock-down of p53 by shRNAs blocks Nutlin-3induced FoxM1 downregulation
We then designed experiments to confirm that
downregulation of FoxM1 by Nutlin-3 was dependent
on the upregulation of functional p53. To do this, we
generated batches of stable cell lines each expressing two
different p53-targeting shRNAs in A2780, NCI-H23, ES2,
and HEC-1A cells. Cells stably expressing non-targeting
control shRNA (NTC) served as the control. As shown in

was reduced to 20 mg/kg starting at Day 22. As a result
of suboptimal carboplatin dose, we observed a trend
suggestive of tumor progression in the group of mice
treated with carboplatin alone (Figure 5B). Interestingly,
despite the suboptimal dose of carboplatin, the group of
mice treated with the combination of carboplatin and
thiostrepton did not show evidence of tumor progression
(Figure 5B). However, as a result of large variations in
bioluminescence imaging and tumor necrosis in DMSO
group (Figure S7), we did not observe a significant
difference in tumor burden at Day 25 and 32. These
results, although limited by technical challenges with
in vivo imaging and variable growth dynamics, support
the potential preclinical activity of the carboplatin and
thiostrepton combination.

FoxM1 enhances carboplatin sensitivity in vivo
To assess in vivo therapeutic potential of
thiostrepton, we treated mice bearing HEC-1A tumor
xenografts with carboplatin alone, thiostrepton alone, or
in combination. DMSO (vehicle) treatment served as a
control group. A weekly dose of 80 mg/kg of carboplatin
was selected based on previous studies indicating that
up to 120 mg/kg weekly dose can be given in mice [46].
Representative bioluminescence images of tumor growth
at Day 25 are shown in Figure 5A. We observed a
significantly measurable response at Day 18 in the groups
treated with carboplatin alone or in combination with
thiostrepton compared to DMSO group at corresponding
time point (Figures 5B). However, we also observed
the evidence of toxicity from carboplatin treatment as
indicated by a drastic weight loss in mice treated with
80 mg/kg carboplatin (Figure S6), and therefore the dose

48 out of 49 tumors have moderate to high levels of FoxM1
expression (Figure 6). Moreover, FoxM1 expression is
higher in tumor cells than surrounding stroma (Figure 6).
We also observed intense but diffuse staining of p53 in
76% (37/49) carcinoma samples, suggestive of harboring
somatic mutations in TP53. In the remaining tumors

expression but also induced basal FoxM1 levels in p53
knockdown cells with wild type TP53.
Interestingly, downregulation of mutant p53 by
RNAi in HEC-1A cells reduced basal FoxM1 expression
levels, suggesting that mutant p53 positively regulates
FoxM1 expression whereas wild type p53 negatively
regulates FoxM1 expression. This may partially explain
the deregulated FoxM1 expression in various cancer as
well as in ovarian cancer because TP53 is frequently
mutated in human carcinomas [2, 47]. This finding is not
completely unexpected because research in recent years
has clearly shown that p53 gain-of-function mutations
can function as a pro-oncogenic factor and induce distinct
changes in gene expression [30, 48]. We are excited to
report this novel observation although it was not the
original focus of the experimental design in this study.
On-going studies in our laboratory are continuing to
investigate the role of oncogenic TP53 mutations in the
regulation of FoxM1 expression.
In this study, the effect of p53 on FoxM1 total,
FoxM1A, FoxM1B, and FoxM1C are almost identical,
indicating that downregulation of FoxM1 by p53 is not
isoform-specific. The exact function of each isoforms
in ovarian cancer is unknown at this time. Based
on studies in other cancer models, FoxM1A may be
transcriptionally inactive, while FoxM1B and FoxM1C
are transcriptionally active and regulate oncogenic
phenotypes [49].

DISCUSSION
Previous studies reported that p53 negatively
regulates FoxM1 expression through transcriptional
repression and implicated p21 and E2F as potential
negative and positive regulator of FoxM1 expression
[12, 13]. In this study, we uncovered another level
of regulation on FoxM1 expression by p53, which is
mediated through regulation of FoxM1 mRNA stability.
First, our results indicate that FoxM1 is downregulated
by Nutlin-3 in A2780 and NCI-H23 cancer cells, and this
regulation is dependent on functional p53. In addition, this
suppression requires de novo transcription and translation
because cycloheximide and actinomycin D attenuated
Nutlin 3-mediated suppression of FoxM1 expression.
Consistent with the role of functional p53 in FoxM1
suppression, downregulation of p53 by RNAi not only
attenuated Nutlin 3-mediated suppression on FoxM1

Figure 6: FoxM1 expression is elevated in tumor tissue. Tumor tissue microarray (TMA) was used to analyze the expression of
FoxM1 in ovarian tumor samples. 48 out of 49 tumors show high or moderately high levels of FoxM1 expression, and stromal compartment
shows minimal expression of FoxM1. In comparison, 37 out of 49 tumors showed high or intermediate levels of p53.

It is interesting to note that FoxM1 mRNA levels
were not immediately suppressed by Nutlin-3 although
p53 was rapidly induced by Nutlin-3. The relatively
slow kinetics of FoxM1 mRNA suppression suggests
the involvement of secondary factors regulating FoxM1
expression. The de novo synthesis of one or more of
these factors is necessary in this process. One possible
explanation is that p53 may stimulate the expression of
certain miRNA through mechanisms involving de novo
synthesis. This miRNA then binds to FoxM1 mRNA
and induces its degradation. However, we have not yet
identified any miRNA that mediates this effect. In fact,
we have examined the expression of miRNA 134, which
is known to target FoxM1 [50] but failed to observe an
induction by Nutlin-3 (data not shown). In silico analysis
of miRTarBase [51] indicates three other miRNAs (miR26b, 186, and 149) as potential regulator of FoxM1
expression. Further studies are needed to identify the
factors involved in decreasing FoxM1 mRNA stability by
p53 in this study.
Previous studies utilizing proteasome inhibitors
indicate that these inhibitors suppress FoxM1
expression [52], and it is proposed that the stabilization
of a hypothetical negative regulator of FoxM1 (NRFM)
by proteasome inhibitors may account for the suppression
of FoxM1 expression [53]. Here, our results provide
an alternative to the role of the hypothetical NRFM
by providing evidence that de novo transcription and
translation is required to downregulate FoxM1 mRNA
and that post-transcriptional regulation of FoxM1 mRNA
stability also contributes to FoxM1 downregulation
(Figure 7). These results are consistent with the proposed
model of a putative NRFM with a high rate of turnover.
Such putative factor would be upregulated by proteasome

inhibitors leading to FoxM1 downregulation, but it would
be downregulated by ActD or CHX leading to FoxM1
stability.
Targeting FoxM1 pathway with FoxM1 inhibitor
thiostrepton induces apoptosis as evidenced by increased
Annexin-V labeling and caspase-3 and PARP1 cleavage.
Thiostrepton also suppresses cell viability as determined
by Alamar Blue staining in TP53 wild type as well as
mutant cells. Cytotoxicity induced by thiostrepton was
more potent than that induced by cisplatin in these cells.
Consistent with previous reports in other cancer cell
lines, thiostrepton downregulates FoxM1 expression in
several ovarian cancer cell lines as well as in endometrial
(HEC-1A) and lung (NCI-H23) cancer cell lines. Finally,
thiostrepton enhances sensitivity to cisplatin in vitro
and carboplatin in vivo. It is important to note that we
do not observe anti-tumor activity of thiostrepton at
30 mg/kg dose that was tested in this study. The limitations
of our studies are that we evaluated just one dose of
thiostrepton as a single agent and that bioavailability,
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of thiostrepton
were not investigated. Moreover, as a result of aggressive
tumor growth in DMSO-treated mice and consequence
necrosis, we observed large variations tumor burden in this
study. Therefore, in future studies, it is therefore important
to investigate several doses of thiostrepton as well as
bioavailability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics
of thiostrepton in ovarian xenograft models. In addition,
it would be important to investigate the in vivo anti-tumor
activity of another FoxM1 inhibitor, Siomycin A, and its
potential synergistic activity with carboplatin in ovarian
tumor xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models.
Finally, it will be important to pre-determine tumor
growth kinetics so that drug response is measured during

Figure 7: Hypothetical model of FoxM1 regulation by p53 through a putative negative regulator. FoxM1 is negatively

regulated by a putative negative regulator of FoxM1 (NRFM) as previously proposed by Andrei Gartel. Putative NRFM may regulate FoxM1
expression at protein level by enhancing FoxM1 degradation or via mechanisms involving decreased mRNA stability. p53 stimulates the
expression/function of this NRFM through transcription- and translation-dependent mechanisms, and consequently downregulates FoxM1.
Transcription inhibitor actinomycin D or translation inhibitor cycloheximide blocks FoxM1 downregulation by p53. Prior model, shown in
gray, is proposed by Gartel et al [53], and indicates that putative NRFM may be stabilized by proteasome inhibitors. Such putative NRFM
with high rate of turnover may be stabilized by proteasome inhibitors but may be destabilized by inhibition of constitutive expression by
either ActD or CHX, leading to enhanced FoxM1 stability.

the growth phase of tumor to avoid confounding factors
resulting from tumor necrosis.
Off-target effect of thiostrepton is a concern. Prior
studies have shown that thiostrepton directly interacts with
FoxM1 and inhibits the binding of FoxM1 to target genes [44].
However, interactions between thiostrepton and other
cellular targets cannot be excluded. Nonetheless, its ability
to downregulate FoxM1 expression and induce cytotoxicity
in p53 mutant as well as wild type cancer cell lines is
significant because it could potentially allow us to target a
component of TP53 gain-of-function and loss-of-function
effect.
In summary, we identified the post-transcriptional
regulation of FoxM1 mRNA stability as a novel
mechanism by which FoxM1 expression is regulated by
wild type p53. We showed that p53, induced by Nutlin-3,
enhances FoxM1 mRNA decay, and this effect requires
de novo transcription and translation. In addition, we
found that mutant p53 can positively regulate FoxM1
expression. These observations point to two potential
mechanisms of FoxM1 upregulation in ovarian cancer:
Both the loss of wild type TP53 and the gain of oncogenic
mutant TP53 may contribute to FoxM1 overexpression.
In particular, we found that R248Q mutation of TP53
in HEC-1A positively regulate FoxM1 expression, and
this observation represents a novel gain-of-function
phenotype of R248Q mutant. R248Q mutant has been
previously described as a neomorphic mutation because
R248Q/- mice showed accelerated tumor onset and death,
and R248Q/+ Li-Fraumeni patients also have accelerated
tumor onset [54]. Since metastatic behavior and tumor
progression have been attributed to both FoxM1 and
R248Q mutation in TP53 [16, 54–56], in future studies
it would be important to delineate the role of FoxM1 in
tumor progression associated with the R248Q mutation
in TP53. In addition, our studies identify FoxM1 as a
potential therapeutic target in several cancer types. These
discoveries are expected to advance our understanding
of p53-FoxM1 axis in cancer and may ultimately allow
rational targeting of this pathway for therapeutic purposes.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

A Click-iT Nascent RNA Capture kit (Invitrogen)
was used to examine FoxM1 mRNA transcription and
stability according to the protocol provided by the
manufacturer. Briefly, nascent RNA in cancer cells was
pulse-labeled with 5-ethynyl uridine for 1 h. Total RNA
was isolated at various time points after labeling and
washout and used in a copper catalyzed click reaction
with an azide-modified biotin. Biotinylated RNA was
captured on streptavidin magnetic beads and reverse
transcribed into cDNA, which was used in the realtime RT-PCR analysis. For analysis of FoxM1 nascent
mRNA transcription, cells were treated with DMSO or
10 µM Nutlin-3 for 2 h or 5 h before pulse-labeling and
immediate isolation of RNA. For FoxM1 mRNA stability

Western analysis
Cells were collected at the end of treatments,
and total proteins were extracted using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing a protease/
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Cell signaling). Protein
concentrations were determined using the BCA protein
assay reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Equal amount
of proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and electroblotted onto PVDF membranes.
After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-Tween
for 2 h at room temperature, blots were incubated with
appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Blots
were then washed and incubated with appropriate
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary
antibodies for 1 h and protein bands were visualized using
a chemiluminescence kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL). Next, blots were stripped and re-probed for β-actin.
The expression level of each protein was normalized to
the level of β-actin.

Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA was extracted from cancer cells using
Trizol reagent. cDNA was synthesized using iScript
Reverse Transcription Supermix (Bio-Rad). The resulting
cDNA was diluted 1:5 in sterile water, and 1 µl aliquots
was used in the qPCR reactions. Primers were designed
with Primer3 plus. qPCR was carried out on a CFX384
Real-Time System (Bio-Rad). A no-template reaction
was included during each experiment to control for DNA
contamination in the reagents. Amplification of GAPDH
was used to normalize the level of mRNA expression.
Each cDNA sample was run in triplicate. Primers used in
the assays are shown in Supplemental Table 2.

Cancer cell lines including SKOV3, OV2008,
A2780, NCI-H23, OVCAR10, HEC-1A, ES2, PE01,
OVCAR 8, and OVCAR3 were maintained in MCDB105
and M199 (1:1) containing 5% FBS, 100 units/Ml
penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. The antibodies
against FoxM1 and β-actin were purchased from Sigma
(St. Louis, MO). The antibodies against p53 and p21 were
purchased from Santa Cruz (Dallas, Texas). Nutlin-3,

(water) and thiostrepton (DMSO) using the combination
therapy dosing schedule. After the first 3 weeks of
drug-treatment the dose of Carboplatin was reduced to
20 mg/kg for the duration of the study. All animal studies
were carried out in the animal facilities of The University
of Kansas Medical Center with strict adherence to the
guidelines of the IACUC Animal Welfare Committee of
KUMC (IACUC approval # 2012–2067).

Stable short hairpin RNA-mediated
downregulation of p53 and FoxM1
GIPZ p53 or FoxM1 lentiviral shRNAs (Thermo
Scientific) were transfected into 293T cells using
Trans-Lentiviral Packaging Kits (Thermo Scientific).
Supernatants containing lentiviral particles were collected
48–64 h post-transfection. The transductions were carried
out in A2780, NCI-H23 or HEC-1A cells 24 h after
seeding. Batch stable clones were selected by puromycin.
The efficiency of knockdown was determined by Western
blot analysis. shRNAs used in the studies are shown in
Supplemental Table 3.

In vivo imaging
Mice (7 to 9 mice for each group) were imaged on a
weekly basis using IVIS spectrum imager. Briefly, animals
were injected with potassium salt of D-Luciferin (15 mg/ml
at 10 µl/gm bodyweight) followed by isoflurane induced
anesthesia. Images were quantified using Living Image
software version 4.0. Region of interest (ROI) boxes were
drawn around the entire body of the animals. Measurements
were expressed as flux, i.e. photons/second (p/s). Graphpad
Prism (ver 6) was used to analyze the significance of
differences in tumor response using the Two-way ANOVA
and the Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test.

AlamarBlue cytotoxicity assay
Cells were plated into 96-well plates (2 X 103cells /
200 μl/well) and cultured in growth medium overnight. The
next day, cells were treated with various concentrations
cisplatin, thiostrepton or in combinations of both
drugs. 48 hours later, cells viability was assessed using
alamarBlue® (Life Technologies). The IC50 for each drug
was determined by GraphPad Prism (version 6) using
­dose-response function. Isobologram for drug synergies
was determined using open source program CompuSyn
(http://www.combosyn.com/) [60].

Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism
(version 6). Multiple t-tests were used for comparison
between control and Nutlin-3 groups. ANOVA was used
for comparison across treatment regimes. Significance was
set at P < 0.05 for all comparisons.

In vivo efficacy study utilizing the HEC-1a
intraperitoneal tumor model

Tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry
Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed from
archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded samples of
ovarian carcinoma from 48 patients. The TMAs also
included matched metastases and recurrences from 14
of the aforementioned 48 patients (1 of these 14 patients
had a late recurrences in the brain), matched metastases
alone for 27 patients and matched recurrences alone
for 7 patients. Using the semi-automated TMArrayer
(Pathology Devices, Inc., Westminster, MD), TMA blocks
were assembled with triplicate 1.0 mm cores of each
tumor sample. Based on review of the original pathology
reports, the ovarian carcinomas were typed as serous
(30 samples), mixed (14 samples; 12 of which included a
serous component), carcinosarcoma (1 sample), clear cell
(1 sample), papillary carcinoma, not otherwise specified
(NOS) (1 sample) and adenocarcinoma, NOS (1 sample).
Rabbit polyclonal antibody FOXM1(C-20) (Sc:502)
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) is
used for immunohistochemical staining according to the
following procedure. Four micron paraffin sections are
mounted on Fisherbrand Superfrost* slides and baked
for 60 minutes at 60ʹC then deparaffinized. Epitope
retrieval was performed in Biocare Decloaking Chamber

Athymic Nu/Nu female mice (7–9 week old)
were inoculated with luciferase expressing HEC-1A
cells (2 × 106) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Briefly,
exponentially growing HEC-1A-luc cells were harvested
and injected into peritoneal cavity of mice using a 27
gauge needle. Three days after tumor inoculation, mice
were imaged using the IVIS Spectrum optical imaging unit
and baseline tumor burden determined for each mouse.
To normalize the tumor burden for each group, mice
that lack tumor take, as determined by bioluminescence
imaging, were dropped from each group, resulting in 7
to 9 mice per group for the study. On day 4, treatment
was initiated and mice were imaged once weekly for
the duration of the study to determine the anti-tumor
response to treatment. In two of the treatment groups,
mice were administered either carboplatin (80 mg/ kg)
weekly or Thiostrepton (30 mg/  kg) daily five days
per week for monotherapy treatment. A third group
received a combination of Carboplatin (80 mg/kg)
and thiostrepton (10 mg/kg) dosed weekly and five
days per week, respectively. The fourth group was a
control group that received the vehicle for carboplatin
