Abstract
The standard systemic treatment for prostate cancer (PCa) is
androgen ablation, which causes tumor regression by inhibiting activity of the androgen receptor (AR). Invariably, PCa
recurs with a fatal androgen-refractory phenotype. Importantly, the growth of androgen-refractory PCa remains
dependent on the AR through various mechanisms of aberrant
AR activation. Here, we studied the 22Rv1 PCa cell line, which
was derived from a CWR22 xenograft that relapsed during
androgen ablation. Three AR isoforms are expressed in 22Rv1
cells: a full-length version with duplicated exon 3 and two
truncated versions lacking the COOH terminal domain (CTD).
We found that CTD-truncated AR isoforms are encoded by
mRNAs that have a novel exon 2b at their 3¶ end. Functionally,
these AR isoforms are constitutively active and promote the
expression of endogenous AR-dependent genes, as well as the
proliferation of 22Rv1 cells in a ligand-independent manner.
AR mRNAs containing exon 2b and their protein products are
expressed in commonly studied PCa cell lines. Moreover, exon
2b–derived species are enriched in xenograft-based models of
therapy-resistant PCa. Together, our data describe a simple
and effective mechanism by which PCa cells can synthesize a
constitutively active AR and thus circumvent androgen
ablation. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5469–77]

Introduction
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed
malignancy in U.S. males and the second leading cause of male
cancer mortality (1). In the event that surgery and/or radiation do
not cure PCa, systemic therapy is based on inhibiting the androgen
receptor (AR). The AR is a 110-kDa steroid receptor transcription
factor, which promotes the growth and survival of normal and
cancerous prostate cells. Androgen ablation, which blocks the
production and/or activity of androgens, initially results in a
favorable clinical response. However, PCa invariably recurs in a
fatal manifestation that is resistant to androgen ablation, as well as
further treatments. Importantly, clinical and experimental evidence
has shown that this stage of the disease, termed androgen
refractory PCa, remains AR-dependent (AD) through mechanisms
of aberrant AR activation (2, 3).

The AR shares a modular organization with other steroid
receptors and consists of an NH2 terminal domain (NTD), a central
DNA-binding domain (DBD), and a COOH terminal domain (CTD).
The amorphous NTD makes up nearly 60% of the AR protein and
has been resistant to structural determination. The remaining 40%
is composed of the DBD and CTD, both of which have been
extensively studied structurally and functionally (4–7). The AR NTD
and CTD possess separate transcriptional activation domains,
termed AF-1 and AF-2, respectively (8). AF-2 maps to a ligandinduced coactivator binding pocket, which is structurally conserved among steroid receptors (6). In contrast to the CTDs of
other steroid receptors, the AR CTD in isolation displays very weak
transcriptional activity (9). The AR NTD shares virtually no
sequence identity with other known proteins and functions as a
potent transcriptional activator in isolation (6, 10, 11). The relative
role of these domains in mediating the transcriptional activation of
AR-regulated genes and the growth and progression of PCa is a
critical unanswered question. We have shown that androgen
refractory PCa cells may circumvent androgen ablation through an
aberrant, NTD-dependent, but CTD-independent, mode of AR
activity (10, 11). This suggests that activation of the AR NTD may
be selected for during progression to androgen refractory disease.
This hypothesis is supported by the finding that a decoy molecule
derived from the AR NTD blocks the growth and progression of
PCa in a xenograft-based model of PCa (12).
The androgen refractory 22Rv1 PCa cell line was derived from an
androgen-dependent CWR22 PCa xenograft that relapsed during
androgen ablation (13). 22Rv1 cells are AD and express the ARregulated gene, prostate-specific antigen (PSA). AR mRNA in 22Rv1
cells contains a duplication of exon 3, which results in a larger AR
protein (hereafter called AREx3dup), consisting of three zinc fingers
in its DBD (14). AREx3dup does not exist in the parental CWR22
xenograft and has not been observed in any other PCa tumor or
cell line (14). Interestingly, in addition to AREx3dup, a novel short AR
isoform is also expressed in 22Rv1 cells that may result from
proteolytic cleavage of full-length AREx3dup (14, 15). Antibody
mapping has shown that this short AR isoform lacks most or all of
the AR CTD but retains an intact NTD and DBD (14). This model
system therefore provides an excellent opportunity to study AR
isoforms that either contain or lack the AR CTD. The purpose of
this study was to understand the mechanism by which these AR
isoforms regulate the androgen refractory phenotype of 22Rv1 cells.

Cancer Research
PCa xenografts. AD and androgen-independent (AI) versions of LuCaP
23.1 and LuCaP 35 PCa xenografts have been described (16, 17). AD
xenografts were propagated in BALB/c nu/nu mice and AI xenografts were
propagated in SCID mice as described (16, 17). Animals were housed in the
Mayo Clinic pathogen-free rodent facility, and all procedures performed
were approved by the Mayo Clinic institutional animal care and use
committee. When tumors reached f100 m3, they were excised and frozen
on dry ice. Before RNA and protein extraction, tumor bits (f27 mm3) were
pulverized under liquid N2 using a mortar and pestle.
Plasmids. Plasmid constructs for full-length AR (h5HBhAR) and MMTVLUC have been described (10, 11). Plasmid 4XARE-E4-LUC was provided
by Dr. Michael Carey (University of California at Los Angeles). Plasmid
AREx1/2/2b was generated by mutating h5HBhAR to generate an XbaI site
within exon 2 using mutagenic primers FW: 5¶-GGAAGCTGCAAGGTCTTCTAGAAAAGAGCCGCTGAAGG and RV: 5¶-CCTTCAGCGGCTCTTTTCTAGAAGACCTTGCAGCTTCC and a Site Directed Mutagenesis kit
(Stratagene). Two oligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed (FW:
5¶-CTAGAAAAGAGCCGCTGAAGGATTTTTCAGAATGAACAAATTAAAAGAATCATAAG and RV: 5¶-CTAGC TTATGATTCTTTTAATTTGTTCATTCTGAAAAATCCTTCAGCGGCTCTTTT) to generate a cassette which
contained exon 2 sequence downstream from the XbaI site spliced to exon
2b. This cassette was phosphorylated and inserted into XbaI-cut h5HBhAR.
The XbaI site within exon 2 was then converted back to wild-type sequence
via site directed mutagenesis. The same strategy was used to generate
AREx1/2/2b, but in this case, the mutagenic primers used were FW: 5¶GAAGCAGGGATGACTCTAGAAGCCCGGAAGCTGAAG and RV: 5¶CTTCAGCTTCCGGGCTTCTAGAGTCATCCCTGCTTC and oligonucleotides
used for cassette generation were FW: 5¶-CTAGGAGGATTTTTCAGAATGAACAAATTAAAAGAATCATAAT and RV: 5¶-CTAGATTATGATTCTTTTAATTTGTTCATTCTGAAAAATCCTC.
Transient transfections. AR-targeted small interfering RNAs (siRNA)
were purchased from Dharmacon. Custom-designed exon 2b–targeted
siRNAs (siEx2b-1 target sequence: 5¶-AATCATAATCAGACACTAACC;
siEx2b-2 target sequence: 5¶-AAGCCATACTGCATGGCAGCA) were purchased from Ambion. The 22Rv1 cell line was transfected with siRNAs via
electroporation as described (11) and harvested 72 h posttransfection. The
VCaP cell line was transfected with siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 as per
the manufacturer’s protocol and harvested 48 h posttransfection. For
reporter gene assays, 105 cells were seeded in 24-well dishes and transfected
the following day using 2 AL of Superfect (Qiagen) mixed with 300 ng of
luciferase reporter, 100 ng of SV40-Renlla, and 2 ng or 10 ng of hAR,
hAREx1/2/2b, or hAREx1/2/3/2b. Transfections were performed in RPMI + 5%
charcoal-stripped serum (CSS). Transfection efficiencies ranged from 50%
to 70%. At 24 h posttransfection, medium was replaced with serum-free,
phenol red–free RPMI with 1 nmol/L mibolerone (Biomol) or vehicle. Cells
were harvested after an additional 24 h in a lysis buffer provided with a Dual
Luciferase Assay kit (Promega). Activities of the firefly and Renilla luciferase
reporters were assayed in 96-well plates via Dual Luciferase Assay and
detected with a Molecular Devices LMax luminometer. Transfection
efficiency was addressed by dividing firefly luciferase activity by Renilla
luciferase activity. Data presented represent the mean F SE from at least
three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.
RNA isolation, 3¶ rapid amplification of cDNA end, and reverse
transcription–PCR. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cell lines and
xenografts using acid-guanidinium phenol/chloroform extraction as described (10). RNA was reverse transcribed using a reverse transcription kit
and an oligo(dT) primer (Roche). cDNAs were subjected to a two-step 3¶
rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) procedure using a 3¶-RACE kit
(Roche). For the first step, cDNA 3¶ ends were amplified using a forward
primer anchored within exon 1 (5¶-TTGAACTGCCGTCTACCCTGTC) and
the reverse primer from the kit. This step 1 reaction was diluted 1:1,000 and
further amplified using nested exon 1–anchored or exon 2b–anchored
primers (Ex1 FW: 5¶-ACAACTTTCCACTGGCTCTGGC; Ex2b FW: 5¶-AATCAGACACTAACCCCAAG) and the reverse primer from the kit.
Conventional PCR was performed on cDNAs using Ex1 FW paired with a
reverse primer specific for exon 2b (5¶-TATGGCTTGGGGTTAGTGTC).
Absolute quantitation of AR mRNA species was performed using an exon

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

2–anchored forward primer (qEx2 FW: 5¶-GTGGAAGCTGCAAGGTCTTC)
paired with either an exon 4–anchored reverse primer (qEx4 RV:
TTCAGATTACCAAGTTTCTTCAGC) or an exon 2b–anchored reverse
primer (qEx2b RV: TTTCTTCAGTCCCATTGGTG). Quantitative PCR with
serial dilutions of plasmids harboring exon 1/2/2b or exon 1-8 cDNAs was
performed using a CyberGreen mastermix (BD Biosciences) exactly as
described (11). Threshold cycle of amplification (C t) values from these
standards were used to generate C t versus cDNA concentration standard
curves. C t values from test RNA samples were obtained via quantitative PCR
and were extrapolated from these standard curves to generate absolute
values for copy number.
For relative quantitation of AR target genes, quantitative real-time PCR
was performed on cDNAs exactly as described (11) using primers specific
for PSA (11), hK2 (18), TMPRSS2 (18), NKX3.1 (FW: 5¶-GTACCTGTCAGCCCCTGAAC; RV: 5¶-GGAGAGCTGCTTTCGCTTAG), SCAP (FW: 5¶CGGTAGACCTGGAGGTGA; RV: 5¶-CGGGCACTAGGGTGAAGTAG), maspin
(FW: 5¶-CCCTATGCAAAGGAATTGGA; RV: 5¶-CAAAGTGGCCATCTGTGAGA), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantitation was used to determine fold change in
expression levels by the comparative C t method using the formula 2 DDC t.
Western blot. PCa cell lines and xenografts were subjected to Western
blot analysis exactly as described (11). Blots were incubated with antibodies
specific for AR (Santa Cruz, N-20, A-442, or N-20) or extracellular signalregulated kinase-2 (ERK-2; Santa Cruz, D-2) exactly as described (11).
Cell viability and proliferation assays. Electroporated 22Rv1 cells were
seeded at a density of 3,000 per well on 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 + 5%
CSS. After 24 h growth, medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 + 5% CSS
containing 1 nmol/L DHT (Sigma) or vehicle. After 0 and 96 h of subsequent
growth, viable cell numbers were determined by MTS reduction (Cell Titer
96 AQueous One, Promega) as described (10). Cell proliferation assays were
performed using the exact same approach; BrdUrd incorporation was
measured 24 h after DHT/vehicle treatment using a Cell Proliferation Assay
kit (Promega) via manufacturer specifications.

Results
Short AR isoforms mediate ligand-independent AR activity
in 22Rv1 cells. To assess whether exon 3 duplication imparts gain
of function to the AR in 22Rv1 cells, we quantified expression of AR
target genes via real-time reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR). For
comparison, we used the VCaP PCa cell line, which harbors wildtype AR protein. After 24 h treatment with the synthetic androgen,
mibolerone, the androgen-responsive PSA and TMPRSS2 (19) genes
were strongly up-regulated in VCaP, but not 22Rv1, cells (Fig. 1A).
In line with these findings, maspin, an androgen-repressed tumor
suppressor gene (20), showed stronger inhibition in VCaP than
22Rv1 cells. These findings suggest that AREx3dup responds more
poorly to androgens than wild-type AR.
One explanation for these findings could be that AR-regulated
genes are already expressed at a high level in the absence of
androgens in 22Rv1 cells. To test for ligand-independent AR activity
in 22Rv1 cells, we knocked down the AR via small-interfering RNA
(siRNA). Unexpectedly, we observed that siRNA targeted to AR exon
7 selectively ablated AREx3dup but had no effect on expression of the
short AR isoform in these cells (Fig. 1B). Moreover, these experiments showed that the previously described short AR isoform (14)
occurs as a doublet. Whereas the AR exon 7–targeted siRNA
selectively ablated AREx3dup, an siRNA targeted to AR exon 1 ablated
all AR isoforms (Fig. 1B). We used a mouse mammary tumor virus
(MMTV)–regulated promoter reporter in these experiments to
monitor AR activity. siRNA-mediated ablation of AREx3dup abolished
MMTV-Luc androgen-responsiveness but had no effect on ligandindependent MMTV-Luc activity (Fig. 1B). Conversely, a significant
inhibition of ligand-independent MMTV-Luc activity was observed

A Novel AR Exon

Figure 1. Short AR isoforms specifically
mediate ligand-independent transcriptional
activation of AR target genes. A, RNA
was isolated from VCaP and 22Rv1 cells
grown in vehicle or 1 nmol/L mibolerone
(Mib ) and subjected to quantitative
real-time RT-PCR using primers specific
for PSA, TMPRSS2, and maspin.
Expression levels are relative to vehicle
treatment, which was arbitrarily set to 1.
B, 22Rv1 cells were transfected with
MMTV-Luc, nontargeted control (CTRL )
siRNA, or siRNAs targeted to AR exon 1
or exon 7 (schematic on right; DBD* , three
zinc-finger DBD). Cells were grown 24 h
in serum-free medium and treated with
1 nmol/L Mib or ethanol (vehicle control) for
24 h. Luciferase activity was determined.
Columns, mean from at least three
independent experiments each performed
in duplicate; bars, SE. MMTV promoter
activity without androgens and siRNAs
was arbitrarily set to 1. Lysates from
vehicle-treated cells were subjected to
Western blot using a polyclonal antibody
targeted to the AR NTD. ERK-2 levels
are shown as a control. C, 22Rv1 cells
were transfected with nontargeted control
(CTRL ) siRNA, or siRNAs targeted to AR
exon 1 (siAR-2) or 7 (siAR-1 ). RNA was
isolated from transfected cells grown for
72 h without androgens. RT-PCR was
performed using primers specific for hK2,
PSA, TMPRSS2, NKX3.1, SCAP, and
maspin. Expression levels are relative

upon ablation of the short AR isoforms. Similarly, ligandindependent expression of the endogenous AR target genes hK2
(21), PSA, TMPRSS2, and NKX3.1 (22) was strongly inhibited by
siRNA targeted to AR exon 1 but not AR exon 7 (Fig. 1C).
Expression of maspin and SCAP, an AR-activated gene (23), were
not affected by AR-targeted siRNAs. These results suggest that
AREx3dup mediates weak androgen-dependent AR activity in 22Rv1
cells, whereas the shorter AR isoforms mediate constitutive, albeit
selective, ligand-independent AR activity. Differential ablation by
exon 1–targeted versus exon 7–targeted siRNA shows that AREx3dup
and the short AR isoforms are derived from distinct mRNA species.
Therefore, contrary to previous reports (14, 15), the short AR
isoform(s) expressed in 22Rv1 cells is not a proteolytic cleavage
product of AREx3dup.
Short AR isoforms mediate androgen-independent proliferation of 22Rv1 cells. To test whether selectively knocking down
AREx3dup and the short AR isoforms also selectively affected
androgen-dependent versus androgen-independent cell growth, we
performed growth assays on 22Rv1 cells 96 hours after transfection
with AR-targeted siRNAs (Fig. 2A). In line with RT-PCR and
reporter gene assays (Fig. 1), ablation of AREx3dup inhibited
androgen-dependent, but not androgen-independent, 22Rv1
growth (Fig. 2B). Conversely, ablation of the short AR isoforms
inhibited growth of 22Rv1 cells in the absence of androgens
(Fig. 2B). Cell proliferation assays with BrdUrd showed that
ablation of the short AR isoforms specifically inhibited the ability of

www.aacrjournals.org

22Rv1 cells to proliferate in the absence of androgens (Fig. 2C) but
did not affect levels of apoptosis (data not shown). These findings
suggest that AREx3dup specifically mediates the growth of 22Rv1
cells in response to androgens, whereas the short AR isoforms
specifically promote the androgen-independent proliferation of
22Rv1 cells.
Identification and characterization of a novel AR exon. Our
data show that the short AR isoforms expressed in 22Rv1 cells
mediate critical features of the androgen refractory phenotype.
Our siRNA data also shows that these short AR isoforms are
translated from mRNA species distinct from AREx3dup. We
therefore generated cDNA from 22Rv1 RNA and performed 3¶
RACE with an exon 1–anchored primer to isolate any potential AR
mRNAs with novel 3¶ ends (Fig. 3A). This approach yielded two
discrete f800 and f900 bp PCR products, which were reduced
by exon 1–targeted but not exon 7–targeted siRNA (Fig. 3A).
Cloning and sequencing of these products revealed the presence of
a novel 17-bp sequence spliced to either exon 2 or exon 3 (Fig. 3A
and B). Using human genome sequence data, we mapped this
sequence, which we termed exon 2b, to a region f37 kb
downstream from AR exon 2 (Fig. 3B). Genomic sequence
immediately following this exon 2b sequence tag was followed by
an A-rich segment, which suggested the oligo(dT) primer used for
3¶ RACE had generated a premature 3¶ cDNA end. Therefore, we
designed a second 3¶ RACE primer, which was targeted to a
sequence downstream from a putative translation stop codon in

exon 2b (Fig. 3C). This approach yielded a f90-bp to 120-bp PCR
product, the expression of which was selectively reduced in 22Rv1
cells treated with exon 1–targeted siRNA (Fig. 3C). Cloning and
sequencing revealed that this additional sequence contained the
remainder of exon 2b, which was polyadenylated at several sites 91bp to 113-bp downstream from the beginning of the exon (Fig. 3B).
Examination of exon 2b sequence indicated that mRNAs
consisting of exons 1/2/2b would generate a truncated AR
consisting of the NTD, the first zinc finger in the DBD, and 11aa
of exon 2b–derived sequence (Fig. 3B). An mRNA consisting of
exons 1/2/3/2b would only exist in cells, such as 22Rv1, where exon
3 has been duplicated within the AR locus. Exons 2 and 3 have the
same reading frame; therefore, an mRNA consisting of exons 1/2/3/
2b would generate a second truncated AR consisting of the NTD,
the entire two zinc finger DBD, and exon 2b–derived sequence
(Fig. 3B). We confirmed the existence of contiguous mRNAs
consisting of exons 1/2/2b and 1/2/3/2b in 22Rv1 cells via RT-PCR
using primers anchored within exons 1 and 2b (Fig. 3B and D). To
confirm that mRNAs harboring exon 2b gave rise to the short AR
isoforms observed in 22Rv1 cells (hereafter called AR1/2/2b and
AR1/2/3/2b), we designed two separate siRNAs targeted to AR exon
2b. As expected, these siRNAs knocked down the expression of
AR1/2/2b and AR1/2/3/2b but did not affect the expression of AREx3dup
(Fig. 3E). Exon 2b–targeted siRNA specifically inhibited androgenindependent but not androgen-dependent 22Rv1 proliferation, as
assessed by BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 4A and B). In line with
these findings, exon 2b–targeted siRNA inhibited androgenindependent expression of AR target genes in 22Rv1 cells
(Fig. 4C). These data thus define a novel exon 2b within the AR
locus of 22Rv1 cells, which can splice to exons 2 or 3, giving rise to
CTD-truncated AR species that promote an androgen-refractory
phenotype.
AR isoforms encoded by exons 1/2/2b and 1/2/3/2b are
constitutively active. We next performed functional tests of
AR1/2/2b and AR1/2/3/2b by cotransfecting AR-null DU-145 cells with

expression vectors and AR-responsive reporter constructs (Fig. 4D).
Expression of full-length AR (AREx1-8) rendered both MMTV-Luc
and 4XARE-E4-Luc responsive to androgens. Expression of either
AR1/2/2b or AR1/2/3/2b induced strong activation of these reporters
in the absence of androgens. As expected, androgen treatment
had no effect on the transcriptional activities of these short AR
isoforms. These results show that both AR1/2/2b and AR1/2/3/2b can
independently function as constitutively active transcription
factors.
AR1/2/2b expression in PCa cell lines. Expression of the
AR1/2/3/2b isoform should be restricted to cells with duplication of
exon 3, which permits the generation of pre-mRNAs with exon 2b
downstream of exon 3. However, synthesis of mRNAs encoding
AR1/2/2b could be achieved in any cell type with a normal AR locus.
Our finding that AR1/2/2b is a constitutively active AR isoform
highlights exon 2b splicing as a simple and effective mechanism by
which PCa could circumvent androgen ablation. Therefore, to
assess if AR mRNAs composed of exons 1/2/2b exist outside of the
22Rv1 model system, we performed RT-PCR with oligo(dT)-primed
cDNAs generated from androgen-dependent LNCaP, VCaP, and
LAPC4 PCa cell lines (Fig. 5A and B). After 35 cycles of
amplification, we observed a faint PCR product from VCaP cDNA,
which corresponded to the product composed of exons 1/2/2b
from 22Rv1 cells (data not shown). However, using a two-step RTPCR strategy, wherein an initial 20-cycle PCR was diluted and used
for a second 35-cycle PCR, we observed products of the expected
size in LNCaP, VCaP, and LAPC4 cells (Fig. 5B). Cloning and
sequencing confirmed these products resulted from splicing of
exons 1/2/2b. In addition to this exons 1/2/2b product, we also
observed a product of f600 bp generated from LAPC4 cDNA.
Interestingly, cloning and sequencing revealed that this product
resulted from splicing of exon 1 to exon 2b. As a control, we also
tested for generation of full-length AR mRNA using exon 1 and
exon 4 PCR primers. Products of the expected size were generated
with cDNAs from LNCaP, VCaP, and LAPC4 PCa cells. Together,

blot using a polyclonal antibody targeted to the AR NTD. B, transfected cells were seeded and cultured for 24 h in medium supplemented with 5% CSS. Cells
were treated with 1 nmol/L DHT or ethanol (EtOH , vehicle control). The relative number of viable cells 0 and 96 h after exposure to these compounds was determined

A Novel AR Exon

Figure 3. Short AR isoforms are encoded
by novel mRNAs containing a novel AR
exon 2b. A, 22Rv1 cells were transfected
with nontargeted control (siCTRL )
siRNA or siRNAs targeted to AR exon 1
(siAR-2 ) or 7 (siAR-1 ) as indicated.
RNA was isolated and subjected to
2-step 3¶-RACE using exon 1–anchored
forward primers. PCR products were
cloned and sequenced. A schematic of
this approach and resultant sequence
data are shown (right ). B, relative location
of exon 2b in the AR locus and summary
of 3¶ RACE and RT-PCR experiments.
Details are discussed in the text.
C, a second 3¶ RACE reaction was
performed on RNA as described in A
using an exon 2b–anchored forward primer
indicated in B. PCR products were
cloned and sequenced, which revealed
3¶ termini 91-113 bp downstream from
the start of exon 2b. These putative sites
of polyadenylation are indicated in B. D,
RT-PCR was performed on RNA used in
A and C with the exon 1–anchored forward
primer used for 3¶ RACE and a reverse
primer indicated in B. PCR products were
cloned and sequenced and confirmed to
consist of spliced exons 1/2/2b or 1/2/3/2b.
E, 22Rv1 cells were transfected with
nontargeted control (CTRL ) siRNA or
siRNAs targeted to exon 1 (siAR-2 ) or 2b.
Transfected cells were cultured 48 h
posttransfection, lysed, and subjected
to Western blot using a polyclonal antibody
targeted to the AR NTD.

these results show that the cellular machinery required for exon 2b
inclusion is not restricted to 22Rv1 cells.
To quantitatively compare the amounts of full-length AR mRNA
and AR exon 1/2/2b mRNAs in these cell lines, we performed
absolute quantitation using a standard curve of known target
concentrations. For measurement of full-length AR mRNA, we
used an exon 2 forward primer paired with an exon 4 reverse
primer. For measurement of AR exon 1/2/2b mRNA, we used the
same exon 2 forward primer paired with an exon 2b reverse
primer. Due to this design, this assay did not discriminate
between the exon 1/2/2b and exon 1/2/3/2b mRNA species
expressed in 22Rv1 cells but provided a measure of the combined
level of these two mRNAs. As expected, androgen refractory 22Rv1
cells expressed higher amounts of exon 2b–containing mRNAs
than androgen-dependent LNCaP, VCaP, or LAPC4 cells (Fig. 5C).
Moreover, exon 2b–containing AR mRNAs were expressed at a
higher level than full-length AR mRNA in the 22Rv1 cells line
(Fig. 5C). Conversely, in LNCaP, VCaP, and LAPC4 cells, AR Exon
1/2/2b mRNA was consistently expressed at 5% to 10% of the
level of full-length AR mRNA (Fig. 5C). Of these androgendependent cell lines, VCaP cells expressed the highest level of
both full-length AR and AR exon 1/2/2b mRNAs (Fig. 5C). We

therefore sought to test whether the AR exon 1/2/2b mRNA
expressed in VCaP cells was translated into AR1/2/2b protein.
Indeed, in addition to full-length AR, a faint immunoreactive
species of f75 kDa was observed in VCaP cells. To determine the
precise identity of this protein, we exploited the selective
targeting properties of AR siRNAs (Fig. 5D). As expected, exon
1–targeted and exon 7–targeted siRNAs knocked-down expression
of full-length AR protein. However, only exon 1–targeted siRNA
knocked down expression of the 75-kDa species. Similarly, exon
2b–targeted siRNA knocked down expression of the 75-kDa
species, but not the full-length AR. From these data, we conclude
that commonly studied PCa cell lines express mRNA and protein
derived from splicing of AR exons 1/2/2b.
AR1/2/2b expression in PCa xenografts. These results raised the
possibility that androgen ablation could select for PCa cells that
can effectively synthesize AR1/2/2b. To test whether expression of
AR1/2/2b might be increased during PCa progression, we used the
LuCaP 23.1 and LuCaP 35 xenograft models. LuCaP 23.1 and 35
tumors grow in intact immunocompromised mice and serve as an
accurate model of androgen-dependent and AD PCa (16, 17). For
example LuCaP 23.1 and 35 tumors regress after castration but
eventually recur in an AD but androgen-refractory manner. We

isolated total RNA from AD and androgen-refractory/AI versions of
LuCaP tumors that had been propagated in intact and castrated
mice, respectively. Similar to our observations in PCa cell lines, we
detected mRNAs resulting from splicing of exons 1/2/2b in these
xenografts (Fig. 6A). The absolute abundance of both full-length AR
mRNA and exon 1/2/2b mRNA were increased in AI versus AD
samples for both LuCaP 23.1 and 35 tumors (Fig. 6B). To further
support this observation, we performed Western blotting on lysates
from AD and AI LuCaP 23.1 and 35 tumors (Fig. 6C). Using two
separate antibodies targeted to the AR NTD, we observed
immunoreactive species with the exact same mobility as AR1/2/2b
from 22Rv1 lysates (Fig. 6C). These species were not detected using
an AR CTD-directed antibody, which further indicated they likely
represented AR1/2/2b protein. Importantly, increased expression of
this putative AR1/2/2b species was observed in AI versus AD
xenografts, which was similar in magnitude to the increase
observed for AR 1/2/2b mRNA. We also observed significantly
more full-length AR protein in AI versus AD xenografts, which has
been previously reported (24). Our data suggest that increased
expression of AR1/2/2b may play a previously unrecognized role in
mediating the androgen refractory phenotype of LuCaP 23.1 AI and
LuCaP 35 AI xenografts.

Discussion
Nuclear receptor CTDs serve a dual function, possessing both
the LBD and AF-2 coactivator binding surface. The model for

activation of the AR and other steroid receptors is that ligand
binding induces an AF-2 conformation that is permissive for
docking with NR boxes (LxxLL and related motifs) of coactivator
molecules, which are required for transcriptional activation. For
the AR, this model is complicated by the fact that AR AF-2 can also
bind an FxxLF motif in the AR NTD and thus mediate an
interaction between the NH2 and COOH termini (9, 25). In in vitro
assays, the affinity of AF-2 for AR-derived FxxLF peptides is higher
than for coactivator-derived LxxLL peptides (6, 26). As a result, the
importance and role of AR AF-2 in transcriptional activation of
target genes has been a topic of debate. Indeed, AR AF-2 functions
as a very weak ligand-dependent transcriptional activation domain
in isolation (9, 27, 28). However, the isolated AR NTD is stronger in
reporter gene assays than the isolated AR CTD (27, 29). Our
previous studies have shown that the AR NTD may play a major
role in mediating PCa therapy resistance (10, 11). The data we
present in this study supports this concept and has shown for the
first time that naturally occurring AR isoforms, consisting of the
NTD and DBD, can support the expression of many endogenous AR
target genes, as well as the growth of androgen-refractory PCa cells
in the absence of androgens.
Various mechanisms of resistance to androgen ablation therapy
have been proposed and shown in various models of PCa progression. For example, mutations in the AR LBD broaden the
ligand specificity of the AR, thus permitting activation by
alternative steroids or even antiandrogens (2). AR overexpression,

which may result from AR gene amplification and/or enhanced
AR transcription, has been shown to sensitize the AR to castrate
levels of androgens (24, 30). Indeed, tissue androgens in androgen
refractory PCa may persist at levels sufficient to elicit AR
activation and may arise from aberrant intratumor androgen
production (31–33). All of these mechanisms are ligand-dependent in nature and have called into question the importance of
ligand-independent AR activation for the development and
progression of androgen-refractory PCa. However, in this study,
our data show that the androgen-refractory phenotype of 22Rv1
cells is due to novel AR isoforms that function in a completely
ligand-independent fashion. Moreover, these isoforms would be
completely resistant to all current androgen ablation regimens,
which are targeted to the AR CTD. Our observation that other
commonly used PCa cell lines possess the machinery required to
synthesize the ligand-independent AREx1/2/2b isoform provides a

www.aacrjournals.org

novel and simple avenue for these PCa cells to achieve androgenindependence. Indeed, in two xenograft-based models of PCa
progression, we observed increased expression of AR exon 1/2/2b
mRNA in AI versus AD tumors. Moreover, we observed a similar
increased expression of a 75-kDa AR species in these AI versus
AD tumors. Our data strongly suggest that this protein species is
AREx1/2/2b; however, a definite conclusion will have to await the
development of antibodies specific for this AR isoform. Importantly, in these models, AREx1/2/2b overexpression was accompanied by overexpression of full-length AR, which has been
previously described (24). Because mRNAs encoding both fulllength AR and AREx1/2/2b are spliced from the same pre-mRNA,
enhanced transcription of the AR gene would result in enhanced
overall expression of both isoforms. It will therefore be important
to assess the relative contributions of AR and AREx1/2/2b
overexpression to PCa progression during androgen ablation.

C, lysates from AD and AI versions of
LuCaP 23.1 and 35 xenografts were
subjected to Western blot using polyclonal
antibodies recognizing the AR NTD or
CTD or a monoclonal antibody recognizing
the AR NTD. The putative AR1/2/2b
isoform is indicated (right ). A schematic
of the antibody recognition sites is
shown (bottom ).

Two previous studies have investigated the nature of the small
AR isoform(s) expressed in 22Rv1 cells and have concluded that
these species arise from calpain-mediated cleavage of AREx3dup
(14, 15). Our data oppose this conclusion and shows that the AR
NTD/DBD isoforms expressed in 22Rv1 cells arise from splicing of
a novel AR exon 2b after either AR exon 2 or exon 3. AR exon 2b
spliced after exon 2 or exon 3 gives rise to protein species
possessing the entire AR NTD fused to the first zinc finger of the
AR DBD (termed AREx1/2/2b) or the entire AR NTD fused to the
complete AR DBD (termed AREx1/2/3/2b), respectively. Structural
studies with AR DBD show that the first zinc finger, encoded by
exon 2, harbors the recognition helix that directly engages with one
hexameric half-site in an androgen response element (ARE; ref. 5).
The second zinc finger, encoded by exon 3, mediates dimerization
with an AR molecule engaged with the neighboring ARE half-site
(5). Our finding that AREx1/2/2b is able to constitutively activate ARresponsive promoters shows that the first zinc finger is sufficient
for the AR to engage with AREs, which agrees with this structural
data. However, because the second exon 3–encoded zinc finger is
responsible for AR dimerization and subsequent stabilization of
ARE-bound ARs, the repertoire of genes that are activated by
AREx1/2/2b may be diminished compared with the repertoire of
genes that are activated by full-length, liganded AR. Dissecting the
differential patterns of gene activation by AREx1/2/2b and full-length,
liganded AR will be important for understanding the relative
abilities of these isoforms to mediate PCa growth.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

In summary, our data indicates that AR truncation, resulting
from aberrant splicing of a novel AR exon 2b, uncouples androgen
signaling from AR activity in 22Rv1 cells. AR mRNA and protein
containing exon 2b were also identified in commonly used PCa cell
lines. Our data further shows that AR mRNA species containing
exon 2b were enriched in xenograft-based models of PCa
progression. Therefore, inclusion of exon 2b in AR mRNAs
represents an effective mechanism by which constitutively active
AR proteins can be produced that are completely resistant to
current CTD-directed PCa therapies.
