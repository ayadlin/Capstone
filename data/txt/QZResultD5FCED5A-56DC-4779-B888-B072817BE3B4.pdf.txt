ABSTRACT
Salivary gland tumor (SGT) is one of the least studied cancers due to its rarity
and heterogeneous histological types. Here, we reported that loss of PTEN expression
was most frequently found in the poorly differentiated, high grade solid adenoid cystic
carcinomas. Loss of PTEN expression correlated with activation of mTOR by increased
phosphorylated S6 ribosome protein. We further functionally studied the role of PTEN
in a pair of human SACC cell lines, SACC-83 and SACC-LM. Reduced PTEN level was
correlated with the metastasis potential. When we knocked down PTEN in the SACC83 cell line, we observed increased proliferation and enhanced migration/invasion
in vitro, and increased tumor size in vivo. We further tested the therapeutical effect
by applying a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 to both SACC cell lines. Decreased
cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, as well as reduced cell migration/invasion
were observed in both cell lines upon the NVP-BEZ235 treatment. Moreover, the NVPBEZ235 treatment in a SGT xenograft mouse model significantly reduced primary
tumor size and lung metastasis. Taken together, our results demonstrated that PTEN
is a potent tumor suppressor in human SGTs, and targeting PI3K/mTOR pathway
may be effective in the targeted therapy for human SGT patients with loss of PTEN
expression.

Among these subtypes, salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma
(SACC) and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) are two
most common cancers in human SGT patients. Although
radiation or occupational exposure may play roles in SGT
tumorigenesis, the etiological factors for SGTs are still
largely unknown [1–4]. Molecular events associated with
human SGTs are poorly understood although chromosome
translocation and gene fusions are commonly seen in
both SACC and MEC [5]. Both rarity of incidence and
heterogeneity of pathology pose challenges for SGT
study, making it one of the least studied tumor type [6].
Because of these circumstances, effective treatments for

INTRODUCTION
Salivary gland tumors (SGTs) are uncommon
tumors, which account for approximately 3–6% of all head
and neck tumors. The annual incidence is approximately
about 2.5 cases per 100, 000 people in U.S. and between
4 and < 0.5 cases per 100, 000 people worldwide [1, 2].
SGTs occur either in major salivary glands including
parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands or in minor
glands. SGT is one of the most heterogeneous tumors,
which is composed of more than 20 histopathological
subtypes with widely varied clinical outcomes [3, 4].

ducts. Furthermore, PTEN and p63 are double-positive
in abluminal cells of acini and ducts, including both
myepithelial cells and basal cells. The distribution of
PTEN, α-SMA, K5 and p63 expression pattern in normal
human salivary gland is summarized in Figure 1C.

these tumors are very limited. There is an urgent need to
understand the molecular mechanisms of formation and
malignant progression in SGTs, which will be translated
into novel therapeutic approaches to improve the current
treatment for SGT patients.
Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted
on chromosome 10 (PTEN), best known as a lipid
phosphatase, negatively regulates cell proliferation and
survival through antagonizing the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) signaling [7]. Somatic mutations,
deletions and epigenetic silencing of PTEN have
been reported in a variety of solid tumors, making
PTEN one of the most important tumor suppressors
in human cancers [8]. Loss of functional PTEN leads
to constitutively activate downstream components of
PI3K pathway, such as AKT and mTOR, providing
an opportunity for targeted therapy using PI3K/AKT/
mTOR inhibitors [7, 8]. In human SGTs, although there
were sporadically reports of PTEN alterations [9–11], it
is still unclear the role of PTEN in SGT tumorigenesis.
Furthermore, it is inconclusive if targeting PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway would be effective for the treatment of
human SGTs.
To address these questions, we first performed a
detailed immunohistochemistry analysis of PTEN in
multiple types of human SGTs, and normal salivary gland
tissues. We then knocked down PTEN to assess its role in
human SGTs both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we tested
a small molecule inhibitor targeting PI3K/mTOR both
in vitro and in a xenograft SGT mouse model to evaluate
its therapeutic effects.

Loss of PTEN expression was predominantly
found in human solid salivary adenoid cystic
carcinomas
We then examined PTEN expression by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a total of 114 human
salivary gland tumors (SGTs). Results of PTEN IHC
staining were summarized in Figure 2A, 2B, and Table 1.
The average PTEN staining index is 5.55 (Table 1). Loss
of PTEN expression (defined as PTEN staining index ≤ 2)
was identified in a total of 23.7% (27/114) of all SGTs
tumors, and was most frequently found in SACCs (47.3%,
26/55) (Figure 2A, 2C, Figure S1 and Table 1). Among
the SACC patients, loss of PTEN expression were
predominantly found in the poorly differentiated, high
grade malignancy, i.e. the solid SACCs (81.8%, 18/22),
and in 11.8% (2/17) tubular and 37.5% (6/16) cribriform
SACCs (Figure 2B, 2C and Table 1). The average of
PTEN staining index is 6.76 in tubular, 3.94 in cribriform,
and 1 in the solid SACCs (Table 1).
We have recently reported that the solid pattern
SACC is one of the poor prognostic factors in SACC
patients [12]. The higher incidence of PTEN loss in solid
pattern SACC prompts us to analyze the patients’ survival
situation and correlate with their PTEN expression.
Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed in 53 SACC
patients, and showed a significant correlation between
patients’ survival and PTEN expression level (Figure S2).
The average PTEN staining index in PAs was
6.5, and about 4.2% (1/24) PAs lost PTEN expression
(Figure 2A, Figure S3 and Table 1). The average PTEN
staining index were 7.25 in MECs, and 8.4 in BCCs and
about 55% of MECs and 20% of BCCs exhibited reduced
PTEN expression (defined as PTEN staining index
between 3 to 6) (Figure 2A, Figure S3 and Table 1). Last,
PTEN was well expressed in either MyECs or AICs, and
there were no loss or reduced PTEN expression in both
SGTs (Figure 2A, Figure S3 and Table 1).

RESULTS
PTEN is ubiquitously expressed in human
normal salivary glands
To investigate the role of PTEN in human salivary
gland tumors, we first examine the expression pattern of
PTEN in normal human salivary glands. As shown in
Figure 1A, a strong cytoplasmic expression of PTEN was
observed in both luminal (epithelial) and abluminal (basal)
cells of intercalated ducts, striated ducts and excretory
ducts of normal human parotid glands. PTEN is also
consistently expressed in the abluminal (myoepithelial)
cells, but barely expressed in the luminal (epithelial)
cells of acini. To further examine the distribution of
PTEN with other salivary gland markers, we performed
double IF of myoepithelial cell marker α-smooth muscle
actin (α-SMA), basal cell marker Keratin 5 (K5), and
abluminal (both myoepithelial and basal cells) cell marker
p63. As shown in Figure 1B, PTEN is co-localized with
α-SMA in the abluminal (myoepithelial) cells, and both
are not expressed in the luminal cells of acini. PTEN
is also co-expressed with K5 in the abluminal cells of

Reduced PTEN expression activated S6
ribosome protein and correlated with HER2
overexpression in human SACCs
The higher incidence of PTEN negative cases
in human SACCs prompted us to further investigate
the role of PTEN in tumorigenesis of SACCs. We first
examined the activation status of two downstream genes
of PI3K pathway, phosphorylation of AKT (pAKT)
and S6 ribosome protein (pS6) in human SACC samples.

While most of the tubular or cribriform SACCs retained
PTEN expression, these cases exhibited undetectable or
low level of pAKT or pS6 (Figure 2C). In contrast, most
solid SACCs lost PTEN expression and almost all these
cases showed high level of pS6 staining (94.4%, 17/18).
In contrast, only 27.8% (5/18) PTEN-negative cases
showed AKT activation (Figure 2C and 2E). We further
examined several molecules which have been reported to
be involved in human SACCs [9, 13, 14]. The percentages
of positive pS6 and HER2 cases were significantly higher
than other three molecules, i.e pAKT, MYB and EGFR.

investigate the role of PTEN in SACC development
and progression. Reduced level of endogenous PTEN
expression was detected in the SACC-LM cell line
compared to the SACC-83 cell line at both mRNA level
as examined by qRT-PCR (Figure 3A), and protein
level as examined by either IF (Figure 3B), or Western
blotting (Figure 3C). Interestingly, similar to the IHC
results from human SACC tissues, reduced PTEN level
in the SACCC-LM cells correlated with S6 activation,
but not with AKT activation at both phosphorylation
sites (Figure 3C). Cell proliferation assay, however,
didn’t show significance difference between SACC-83
and SACC-LM (Figure 3D); Instead, SACC-LM
cells exhibited more migratory and invasive abilities
compared to the SACC-83 cells (Figure 3E). We further
subcutaneously injected both SACC cell lines into
nude mice. Tumors started to grow at day 12 for both
SACC-83 and SACC-LM, and were harvested at day
30. As shown in Figure 3F, SACC-LM cell line formed

in the siPTEN cells. We then used scratch wound assay
and migration/invasion chamber assay to assess the
role of PTEN in cell migration and invasion. PTEN
knockingdown significantly accelerated wound closure as
early as 12 hours after wounding (Figure 4D). Increased
cell migration and invasion were further elucidated
in siPTEN cells by the migration (Figure 4Ea, b) and
invasion (Figure 4Ec, d) chamber assays. Lastly, we
injected SACC83-siControl and SACC83-siPTEN cells
into nude mice. Tumor started to grow after 9 days after
injection of SACC83-siPTEN cells compared to 12 days
after injection of SACC83-siControl cells. By the 30 days
when we harvested tumors, the average tumor volumes
of SACC83-siPTEN cells were about 4.5 times bigger
than those of SACC83-siControl cells (Figure 4F).
Taken together, both in vitro and in vivo data clearly
demonstrated a tumor suppressor role of PTEN in SACC
tumorigenesis.
To further understand the underlying molecular
mechanisms of PTEN loss in SACC tumorigenesis, we

To further assess the role of PTEN in SACC
tumorigenesis, we transfected PTEN siRNA into the
SACC-83 cell line. Nearly 80% PTEN knockingdown was
achieved as examined by Western blotting (Figure S4A).
Correspondingly, both phosphorylation sites of AKT and
one phosphorylation site of its downstream signaling
effector pS6 are activated upon PTEN silencing, suggested
a solid link between PTEN and the PI3K/AKT pathway
(Figure S4B). Cell proliferation assay showed significantly
increase of cell proliferation in siPTEN cells compared
to siControl cells (Figure 4A). Increased cell proliferation
was further confirmed by higher percentage of BrdU

cells transfected with siPTEN/siControls. We particularly
examined genes related to PI3K/mTOR pathway which
are directly related to the PTEN silencing and cell
proliferation. Although the majorities of molecules in
PI3K/mTOR pathway are not significantly affected at
mRNA level, one interesting molecule, Unc-51 like
autophagy activating kinase 1(ULK1), is significantly
downregulated upon PTEN silencing (Figure S5A).

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ULK1 has been identified as one the key molecules for
regulating cell autophagy [15]. The strong correlation
between PTEN and ULK1 warrants a further study
of PTEN in autophagy and cancer. In addition,
downregulation of E-cadherin encoding gene CDH1 and
upregulation of vimentin (Figure S5B) suggests the role
of PTEN in cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition.

DISCUSSION

To further evaluate the efficacy of NVP-BEZ235
inhibitor to treat SACC in vivo, we subcutaneously injected
SACC-LM cells into nude mice to establish a SACC
xenograft mouse model. Histological examination revealed
several histological similarities of these xenografts to
human SACCs. Tumor cells arranged densely in small
duct-like (Figure S8A, A’), small clumps (Figure S8B, B’)
and solid cord-like (Figure S8C, C’) structure. The small
duct-like structure made form 2–3 layers of cells scattered
throughout the tumor and sometimes the cavity containing
the mucus. Dedifferentiated tumors have irregular tumor
islands composed of anaplastic cells with abundant
cytoplasm and desmoplastic stroma (Figure S8D, D’),
and some tumor cells are filled with some mucus-like
material in certain area (Figure S8E, E’). IHC staining of
myoepithelial markers of p63 (Figure S9A, A’), α-SMA
(Figure S9B, B’), and calponin (Figure S9C, C’) and
basal cell markers of K5 (Figure 9D, D’) and K8/18
(Figure 9E, E’) further showed the histological similarities
between human SACCs and tumors from the SACC cell
lines.
We then applied 35 mg/kg NVP-BEZ235 po. at
day 7 after injection of SACC-LM cells, and treated once
a day for a consecutive 21 days. This treatment was well
tolerated in mice and didn’t generate obvious adverse
effects during the treatment. Tumor started to grow
beginning at day 15 in the vehicle control group and at
day 24 in the NVP-BEZ235 treated group (Figure 6A).
We harvested tumors at day 30, and observed significantly
smaller tumors upon NVP-BEZ235 treatment. The
average tumor weight was nearly 90% reduced (0.17 g
vs. 1.55 g) in the NVP-BEZ treatment group compared
to the control group (Figure 6B). NVP-BEZ235 treatment
also inhibited cell proliferation in vivo as examined by
Ki67 IHC staining (2.05% vs. 31.7%, Figure 6C), and
induced cell apoptosis in vivo as shown by the percentage
of caspase 3 positive cells (27.5% vs 1.5%, Figure 6D).
Correspondingly, both phosphorylation sites of AKT, one
phosphorylation of pS6 were significantly diminished
upon NVP-BEZ235 treatment. The activity of the AKTdownstream pro-apoptotic protein BAD was also reduced
after the treatment (Figure 10S).
We then assessed the therapeutical efficacy of NVPBEZ235 on lung metastasis. We intravenously injected
SACC-LM cells, applied 35 mg/kg NVP-BEZ235 po.

injection. Histological examination showed that 9 out of
9 mice developed lung metastasis in the control group,
while 2 out of 6 mice developed lung metastasis in the

In this study, we examined PTEN expression in both
normal human salivary glands and a variety of human
SGTs, including two most common types SACC and MEC.
We also compared PTEN expression with several epithelial
(luminal) and myoepithelial/basal (abluminal) cell markers
by IHC staining. We found that PTEN was expressed in all
luminal and abluminal cells of intercalated, striated, and
excretory ducts of normal human salivary gland. PTEN
was also expressed in abluminal acini cells, but not in
luminal acini cells. This ubiquitous expression pattern of
PTEN suggests a common role of PTEN in suppressing
a variety of human SGT development. Indeed, we found
about 23.7% SGT cases with loss of PTEN expression
in a total of 114 human SGTs, which is consistent with
a recently report (21.6%) [9]. However, we found most
of the SGT cases with loss of PTEN expression were
human SACCs, while Etti et al reported a higher cases of
loss of PTEN expression in salivary duct carcinomas and
squamous cell carcinomas [9].
SACC is the second most common SGTs in humans.
It is characterized by endless growth, diffuse invasion, a
high rate of local recurrence and metastasis, causing a
substantial mortality. Based on the components of its
histological cell types, SACC is roughly divided into
three major patterns, i.e. cribriform, tubular, and solid
pattern. Among the three, solid pattern is the most poorly
differentiated, high grade malignancy with higher rate of
recurrence and metastasis. We have shown solid pattern
of SACC has the lowest survival rate in our more than ten
years patient’s follow-up [12]. Interestingly, our study here
found that over 80% of solid SACC lost PTEN expression,
significantly higher than other two patterns of SACCs,
highlighting the important role of PTEN in suppressing
development of solid SACC, and loss of PTEN in solid
SACC progression. In addition, using the Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis, we found the correlation between PTEN
expression and SACC patinets’ survival. Supporting
our finding, the association between PTEN and disease
prognosis and lymph node metastasis in human SGTs has
also been currently reported [9, 16].
The molecular mechanisms for PTEN loss in human
SGTs are still not fully understood. A germline mutation
has been reported in human epithelial myoepithelial
cacinomas of salivary gland [17], and a case of acinic cell
carcinoma patient [11], respectively. However, two recent
studies using whole exome sequencing revealed that
somatic mutations of individual gene are generally low,
except the common MYB-NFIB gene fusion in human

SACCs. There is only one SACC case of PTEN mutation
in a total of 80 SACC cases they analyzed [18, 19].
In contrast, either homozygous or hemizygous deletion
of PTEN has been reported in over 20% of human SGTs
and correlated with PTEN expression [9]. The results

of PTEN methylation in human SGTs are controversial
and inconclusive [20, 21]. In addition to these genetic
or epigenetic changes, posttranslational modification or
certain microRNAs targeting PTEN are also possible to
be responsible for the reduced expression of PTEN in

for improving current therapeutic protocol. In our study,
almost all the SGT patients with reduced PTEN expression
manifested activation of PI3K/mTOR. By using a PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235, strong growth inhibition
were observed in both SACC-83 and SACC-LM cell
lines. NVP-BEZ235 treatment also strongly reduced
cell migration and invasion. More importantly, a potent
treatment efficacy on primary tumor size and distant lung
metastasis upon NVP-BEZ235 treatment was observed
in the SGT xenograft mouse model. Correspondingly,
the activities of AKT and pS6 as well as one of the proapoptotic protein BAD in the PI3K/AKT pathway were
significantly diminished upon the NVP-BEZ235 treatment.
This finding strongly supports the rationale of using PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor for SGT patients, particularly on patients
with loss of PTEN expression. Similar treatment efficacy
was also reported in the PTEN genetically engineered
mouse model in that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin
treatment led to complete regression of SGT tumor growth
[27]. Furthermore, partially response but no toxic effect of
using mTOR inhibitor, Temsirolimus on two salivary gland
cancers patients with cutaneous metastasis was reported
recently [28], providing a strong rationale of applying
mTOR inhibitor for SGT treatment. In our study, we also
found reduced PTEN expression was correlated with
HER2 overexpression. This result is in consistent with the
recent report that deletion of PTEN correlated with HER2
gene amplification. However, in contrast to their findings,
we didn’t observe the correlation between PTEN deletion
and EGFR overexpression [9]. While this result may be
further supportive of using HER2 inhibitor, it also raise
question of using EGFR inhibitor in the current targeted
therapy for SGT patients. Interestingly, no significant
clinical response of a phase II study of gefibinib in
advanced SGT patients was recently reported [29].
In summary, our study showed a significantly
reduction of PTEN in human SGTs, particularly in the
solid pattern of human SACCs. This reduction of PTEN
correlated with activation of PI3K/mTOR and HER2
overexpression, but not with AKT activation or EGFR
overexpression. We further functionally validated a
potent tumor suppressing role of PTEN in human SGT
development and progression. Lastly, experimental
therapy of using PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235
successfully reduced primary tumor growth and lung
metastasis. Our results highlighted the importance of using
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor in the treatment for human SGT
patients with reduced PTEN expression.

human SGTs. Further investigation is warranted, which
may provide novel therapeutical opportunities for these
patients.
Loss of PTEN expression usually results in
activation of AKT/mTOR pathway due to its antagonizing
function to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and activation
of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has been reported in
human SGTs [22]. This correlation was also evidenced
in the SACC-83 cells transfected with siPTEN. The solid
correlation between PTEN and PI3K/mTOR pathway
provides an excellent opportunity of using inhibitors
targeting PI3K/mTOR for targeted therapy for human
SGTs. However, only less than 30% of cases of loss of
PTEN expression exhibited AKT activation, while nearly
95% cases showed S6 activation in our SGT patients,
suggesting in some cases of loss of PTEN expression,
activation of mTOR will not be always dependent on
AKT status. Similar results of uncoupling between PI3K/
mTOR and AKT activation have been observed [23, 24].
We also examined three molecular alterations commonly
seen in human SGTs [25]. Both HER2 and MYB, but not
EGFR overexpression correlated with the loss of PTEN
expression cases. Both targeting HER2 and EGFR as
novel therapy for human SGTs have been proposed and
tested [1, 2, 26]. Our data suggest that targeting mTOR, or
HER2, instead of AKT, or EGFR may be more effective in
human SACC treatment.
Followed our study on human clinical SGT samples,
we also functional evaluated the role of PTEN in human
SACC cell lines. Reduced PTEN expression was observed
in the lung metastasis counterpart SACC-LM compared
to the primary SACC line SACC-83, suggesting loss
of PTEN may also suppress lung metastasis of SACC.
Interestingly, increased S6 activation, but not AKT
were observed in the SACC-LM cell lines compared to
the SACC-83 cell line, suggesting activation of mTOR,
but not AKT may dominantly drive SACC progression.
Further experiment of PTEN knocking down in the
SACC83 cell line significantly increased cell proliferation,
colony forming, cell migration and invasion in vitro, and
increased tumor size in vivo. Interestingly, a recent report
of using genetically engineered mouse model of PTEN
and APC developed spontaneous SGT [27]. These data
strongly support that PTEN is a potent tumor suppressor
in human SGT development and progression.
Besides the well-documented role of PTEN in the
PI3K/mTOR pathway, we are also interested to explore
the novel function of PTEN in SACC tumorigenesis. To
this point, our microarray data suggested two interesting
pathways, cellular autophagy and epithelial mesenchymal
transition are possible affected by the PTEN expression. This
pilot result warrants a detailed mechanistic investigation of
PTEN in human SACC tumorigenesis in future.
Current therapeutic options for human SGT are still
very limited [1–3, 26]. Thus, the development of novel,
effective therapies to treat patients with SGTs is critical

Patients and clinical samples
All patient samples were collected from the Dalian
Medical University and the 9th People’s Hospital of
Shanghai Jiao Tong University during 2001 to 2013 under
11487

Oncotarget

the approvals of the protocol by both Institutional Review
Boards. Diagnosis of the SGTs in this study was evaluated
by head and neck cancer pathologists and informed
consent was obtained from each patient. The samples
comprised of a total of 114 SGTs, including 55 salivary
adenoid cystic carcinomas (SACCs), 24 pleomorphic
adenomas (PAs), 20 mucoepidermoid carcinomas
(MECs), and 5 cases of each basal cell carcinomas
(BCCs), myoepithelial carcinomas (MyECs), and acinic
cell carcinomas (AICs). 20 normal salivary gland (NSG)
tissues were also included in this study. The demographic
and clinic-pathological information for each patient is
listed in Table 1.

Nuclei were labeled with 4, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI, Beyotime Biotech, Jiangsu, China, 1:500). Images
were collected with a BX43 fluorescence microscope
(OLYMPUS) using cellSens software.

Quantitative analysis of immunostainings
The staining intensity was graded using a fourpoint scale: 0, no staining; 1, light yellow; 2, brown;
and 3, dark brown (Figure S1). The proportion of cells
stained was assessed using a four-point scale: 0, < 10%
staining; 1, 11–50% staining; 2, 51–75% staining; and 3,
> 75% staining. The staining index (intensity multiplies
proportion) was determined as follows: 0–2, loss of
staining, 3–6, reduced staining, and 7–9, normal staining.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded slides from
either human tissues, or mouse xenografts were used for
the following IHC analysis according the protocol we have
described [30]. Antibody binding was visualized by the
VECTORSTAIN ABC kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA,
USA, PK-4001) and DAB Kit (Maixin Biotech, Fujian,
China, DAB-1031), and counterstained with haematoxylin.
Pictures were taken by the Olympus cellSens software, and
a BX43 microscope (OLYMPUS) for light microscopy.
The primary antibodies for human tissues used were
PTEN (Zymed, San Francisco, CA, USA; 18–0256),
phospho-AKT-Ser473 (Cell signaling, Beverly, MA,
USA, #9271), phospho-AKT-Thr308 (Cell signaling,
Beverly, MA, USA, #4056), phospho-S6 ribosomal
protein (Cell signaling, Beverly, MA, USA, #2211),
EGFR (Zymed, San Francisco, CA, USA, 28–0005),
v-Myb+c-Myb (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, ab45150), and
HER2 (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, MS325B0). The
primary antibodies for the mouse xenografts were Ki67
(Maixin Biotech, Fujian, China, MAB-0672), Calponin
(Maixin Biotech, Fujian, China, MAB0335), cytokeratin
K8/18 (Maixin Biotech, Fujian, China, MAB0650), p63
(Maixin Biotech, Fujian, China, MAB0365), cytokeratin
5 (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, MS-1896), S100
(Maixin Biotech, Fujian, China, Kit-0007–2) and caspase
3 (Cell signaling, Beverly, MA, USA, #9664).

PTEN knockdown was achieved by transfected
PTEN siRNA (pSURE/siPTEN, Qiagen, Valencia, CA,
USA). The SACC-83 cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/
well in 6-well plate, and transfected with pSURE/siPTEN
PTEN siRNA using LipofectamineTM 2000 Transfection
Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. After 24 hours, cells with
transient transfection PTEN siRNA were harvested for the
subsequent experiments.

Immunofluorescence (IF)

RNA extraction and quantitative PCR

Double IF was carried on the formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded slides from human normal salivary
tissues to examine PTEN (Zymed, San Francisco, CA,
USA, 1:100, 18–0256) distribution compared with α-SMA
(Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China,
1:500, AA132), p63 (Maixin Biotech, Fujian China,
ready-to-use, MAB0365), and Cytokeratin 5 (Thermo
Scientific, San Jose, CA, 1:200, MS-1896) using the
protocol we described previously [30]. Double IF labeling
was achieved by mixing Alexa Fluor488-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG and Fluor594-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 1:500).

Total RNA was isolated from cells by TRIzol
Reagent (Takara, Japan), according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA
using PrimeScriptTM RT reagent Kit with gDNA
Eraser (Perfect Real Time, Takara, Japan, DRR047).
Quantitative PCR was performed by using SYBR Premix
Ex TaqTM II kit (Takara, Japan, DRR0820) running
on the TP800 Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System
(Takara). GAPDH served as an endogenous control
gene. The PTEN primer was used: human PTEN forward
5′- GAGCGTGCAGATAATGACAAGGAAT- 3′ and
reverse 5′- GGATTTGACGGCTCCTCTACTGTTT- 3′.

Cell culture
SACC-83 cell line was established from a
patient with SACC in the sublingual gland. SACCLM cell line was derived from the parental SACC83 through in vivo selection from the lung metastatic
foci, and has a higher lung metastasis rate compared to
SACC-83 [31, 32]. Both cell lines were kindly provided
by Dr. Sheng-Lin Li of Peking University School and
Hospital of Stomatology, China. Cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37ºC in 5% CO2 cell incubator
(Thermo Scientific).

Oncotarget

Xenograft models

All the qPCR experiments were performed in triplicates,
and the results were analyzed using 2 − ΔΔCt method as we
described recently [30].

All animal experiments were approved the IACUC
committee of Dalian Medical University. A total of fortysix 6-to 8-wk-old male athymic nude mice were used.
Tumorigenicity was assessed after the subcutaneously
injection of 5 × 106 cells; metastasis was evaluated after
the i.v. injection of 2 × 106 cells. Tumors volumes were
recorded every 3 days and calculated with the formula
V = (Length × Width2)/2. Tumor and lung tissues
were harvested and fixed in 4% PFA for histological
characterization.

Western blot analysis
Protein was isolated in ice-cold RIPA buffer
containing complete protease/ phosphatase inhibitors
(KeyGEN Biotech, Nanjing, China, KGP250), and
quantified by BCA method. 60 μg of total protein
were underwent SDS-PAGE and transferred to a
nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane were then
blocked in the 5% skim milk solution in TBST and the
incubated with the primary antibody at 4ºC overnight,
and subsequently incubated with the HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 hours.
Signals were detected using ECL Western blotting
substrate (Thermo Scientific, Ashville, NC). Antibodies
directed against PTEN (#9559), phospho-AKT-Thr308
(#4056), phospho-AKT-Ser473 (#9271), phospho-S6
Ribosomal Protein (1:500, #2211) were all purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology (Cell signaling,
Beverly, MA, USA).

Inhibitor treatment
For in vitro experiments, cells were seeded in
T75 flasks until becoming ~80% confluent. A final
concentration of 500 nM NVP-BEZ235 (Novartis, Basel,
Switzerland) dissolved in DMSO was then added for 4
hours. For in vivo experiments, we injected either 5 × 106
SACC-LM cells subcutaneously or 2 × 106 SACC-LM cells
intravenously at day 0. Nine days after injection, mice were
randomized into controls and treated groups, and received
35 mg/kg/day dissolved in 10%NMP/90%PEG300 (sigmaaldrich, St. Louis, MO, #328634, and #90878) daily for
21 days by oral gavage. The control group was orally
treated with the vehicle only. Mice were sacrificed after
21 days of treatment and the tumor and lung tissues were
harvested.

Cell proliferation
For cell proliferation assay, SACC cell lines were
seeded in 96-well plates (Costar) at 5000 cells per well.
Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay (Dojindo, Kyushu,
Japan) was used to assess cell proliferation rate at each
time point according to the manufactory’s protocol.
Absorbance values were measured at the wavelength of
450 nm. For the clonogenic assay, a total of 5000 cells
were plated in 6 cm plates. The plates were incubated for
8 days and stained with 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet. Colonies
were counted under a microscope. For BrdU incorporation
assay, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, B5002) at a final concentration of
10  μM was added to the culture medium for 24 hours.
Subsequently, cells were fixed and IF was done with
mouse anti-BrdU antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, 1:200, B8434).

Gene expression microarray
Total RNAs of each group were used for generation
of Cy3-labeled complementary RNA (cRNA) for the
Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray
(4 × 44K) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
USA), containing 41,000 human transcripts. Ratio was
calculated by comparison between siPTEN group and
siControl group. Genes were analyzed and the heatmap
was generated using the SBC analysis system (Shanghai
Biotechnology Corporation, Shanghai, China).

Statistical analysis

Migration and invasion

Data results for individual assays represent the
means ± SEM. All calculations were done using IBM
SPSS Statistics 19. Statistical comparisons were made
using the two-tailed Student’s t-test. All p-values of
less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
GraphPad Prism 5.0 software was used to create graphs.

Cell migration was assessed by scratch wound assay.
Monolayer cells were grown until confluence and a scratch
wound with 400–600 μm distance was introduced with a
200 μl pipette tip. Wound closure was measured under the
microscope for 36 to 48 hours.
Transwell assays were performed using Transwell
chambers (Corning Costar, #3422) with a polycarbonate
membrane (6.5 mm diameter, 8 μm pore size) with/without
Matrigel (BD Biosciences, 354480). Cells were counted
in five individual fields on each insert and calculated by
Image-Pro Plus Version 7.0 Software.
