Abstract
Genetic modification of clinical-grade T cells is undertaken to
augment function, including redirecting specificity for desired
antigen. We and others have introduced a chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) to enable T cells to recognize lineage-specific
tumor antigen, such as CD19, and early-phase human trials
are currently assessing safety and feasibility. However, a significant barrier to next-generation clinical studies is developing a suitable CAR expression vector capable of genetically
modifying a broad population of T cells. Transduction of
T cells is relatively efficient but it requires specialized
manufacture of expensive clinical grade recombinant virus.
Electrotransfer of naked DNA plasmid offers a cost-effective
alternative approach, but the inefficiency of transgene
integration mandates ex vivo selection under cytocidal
concentrations of drug to enforce expression of selection
genes to achieve clinically meaningful numbers of CAR+
T cells. We report a new approach to efficiently generating
T cells with redirected specificity, introducing DNA plasmids
from the Sleeping Beauty transposon/transposase system
to directly express a CD19-specific CAR in memory and
effector T cells without drug selection. When coupled with
numerical expansion on CD19+ artificial antigen-presenting
cells, this gene transfer method results in rapid outgrowth
of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing CAR to redirect specificity
for CD19+ tumor cells. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2961–71]

Introduction
The most robust example of successful T-cell therapy occurs
following allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation where
the engrafted donor-derived T cells recognize recipient tumorassociated antigens in the context of MHC. However, the graftversus-tumor effect after allogeneic-hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation is incomplete, resulting in relapse as the major
cause of mortality. To augment the graft-versus-tumor effect for
B-lineage neoplasms, we have previously shown that genetically
modified peripheral blood– and umbilical cord blood–derived
T cells can be rendered specific for CD19, a molecule constitutively
expressed on B-cell malignancies (1, 2). The redirected specificity
was achieved by electrotransfer of a linearized DNA plasmid
coding for a first-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR),

designated CD19R, which recognizes CD19 via the scFv of a murine
CD19-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) fused to a chimeric
CD3-~–derived activation endodomain. A phase I trial (BB-IND1141,
clinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00182650; ref. 3) is currently
evaluating the safety and feasibility of infusing autologous T cells
electroporated to coexpress CD19R CAR and the hygromycin
phosphotransferase (Hy) and herpes simplex virus-1 thymidine
kinase selection/suicide fusion transgene (4).
We anticipated that the therapeutic efficacy of adoptive transfer of
CD19-specific T cells would be improved by developing a CAR with a
fully competent activation signal and introducing the CAR into
central memory (CM) T cells. As a result, a second-generation CAR,
designated CD19RCD28, has been developed that provides CD19dependent signaling through chimeric CD3-~ and CD28, resulting in
improved in vivo persistence and antitumor effect, compared with
CD19R+ T cells (5). To further optimize the clinical potential of CAR+
T cells, while taking advantage of the cost-efficiency of nonviral gene
transfer, we desired a clinically feasible approach to the efficient
propagation of CAR+ T-cell populations, including TCM, in the
absence of expression immunogenic drug selection genes, such as
Hy. We reasoned that genetically modified T cells could be selectively
propagated, upon activating T cells for sustained proliferation,
through the introduced second-generation CAR. To maximize
transgene expression, we codon-optimized (CoOp) the CAR as
reports have shown that codon optimization of genes toward human
consensus codon usage increases protein expression (6, 7).
The focus on developing nonviral gene transfer technologies is
justified based on the cost and time savings compared with
developing recombinant clinical-grade viral supernatant, which are
subject to rigorous regulatory oversight and rely on specialized
manufacturing experience of a limited number of production
facilities. Although the transfection efficiency of nonviral gene
transfer is inferior to viral-mediated transduction, naked DNA
plasmids expressing desired transgenes such as CAR can be rapidly
produced at a fraction of the cost compared with clinical grade
g-retrovirus and lentivirus. A potential drawback to nonviral
gene transfer, compared with viral gene transfer, is the lengthy
ex vivo manufacturing time to selectively propagate electroporated
T cells with stable expression of transgene, during which time the
cells may become susceptible to replicative senescence, lose
expression of desired homing receptors, and furthermore be
cleared in vivo due to recognition of immunogenic drug selection
transgene (8, 9). What is needed is an approach that when coupled
with nonviral gene transfer shortens the culture time to generate
T cells with durably expressed transgene and maintains a desired
T-cell immunophenotype.
To introduce the CAR, we evaluated whether the efficient
transposition and long-lasting transgene expression of the

Sleeping Beauty (SB) DNA transposon derived from Tc1/mariner
superfamily of transposons (10, 11) can improve transgene transfer
efficiency. The SB transposable element from a DNA donor plasmid
can be adapted for nonviral gene transfer in T cells, using a SB
transposase supplied in trans to mediate integration of a
transposon CAR expression cassette flanked by terminal inverted
repeats (IR), which each contain two copies of a short direct repeat
(DR) that have binding sites for the transposase enzyme (Fig. 1D).
The SB transposase mediates transposition by binding to IRs,
excising a precise DNA sequence flanked by the IRs, and inserting
the transposon into any of f200 million TA sites in a mammalian
genome (12). Previously, the SB system has been used as a nonviral
gene delivery into multiple murine and human cell lines, including
liver, keratinocytes, endothelial cells, lung, hematopoietic progenitor cells, embryonic stem cells, and tumor cells (11). Of
particular relevance is that SB-mediated integration has been
shown in human T cells (13), signifying the potential application of
this technology.
We report that electrotransfer of a two-component DNA SB
system into primary human T cells from umbilical cord blood and
peripheral blood results in efficient and stable CAR gene transfer,
which can be numerically expanded to clinically meaningful
numbers within 4 weeks on CD19+ artificial antigen-presenting
cell (aAPC), without the need for addition of cytocidal concentrations of drug for selection, and with the outgrowth of CD8+ and
CD4+ CM and effector CAR+ T-cell subpopulations. This was
achieved through the rationale design of (a) a next-generation

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

codon-optimized CD19-specific CAR, (b) CD19+ aAPC expressing
desired costimulatory and cytokine molecules, and (c) SB DNA
plasmids expressing CAR transposon and an improved transposase.
The relative ease of DNA plasmid production, electroporation, and
outgrowth of stable integrants on a thawed g-irradiated bank of
aAPC can be readily transferred to the facilities operating in
compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) for
phase I/II trials. This is predicted to greatly facilitate trial design
infusing CD4+ and CD8 + CAR + T cells that have desired
immunophenotype, including TCM.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids. The plasmid pT-MNDU3-eGFP containing salmonid fish–
derived SB IR flanking the constitutive promoter, derived from the U3
region of the MND retrovirus (14), to drive an eGFP reporter gene (15), was
derived from the plasmid pT-MCS (16) that was derived from pT/neo (10).
The second-generation CD19RCD28 CAR (5) was human codon optimized
(CoOp), substituting codons with those optimally used in mammals
(GENEART) without altering anticipated amino acid sequence. The
codon-optimized CD19RCD28 (CoOpCD19RCD28) CAR was subcloned
into pT-MNDU3 DNA plasmid by replacing the eGFP sequence with
the CAR to create CoOpCD19RCD28/pT-MNDU3 (Fig. 1A). The DNA
plasmid pCMV-SB11 (Fig. 1B) expresses the SB11 transposase (17).
Plasmid CoOpCD19RCD28/Hy-pVitro4 (Fig. 1C ) was generated from
pVitro4-mcs DNA vector (InvivoGen) by subcloning CoOpCD19RCD28 at
NheI in multiple cloning site two and replacing the internal ribosome entry
site (IRES) for the foot and mouth disease virus with that of the
encephalomyocarditis virus ( from pMG vector described; ref. 6). To

generate cell surface–bound human interleukin 15 (IL-15), the granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor signal peptide sequence was fused to
the coding sequence of mature human IL-15 at the 5¶ end of a modified
human IgG4 Fc region (5) fused in frame to human CD4 transmembrane
domain and correct assembly was verified by DNA sequence analysis. The
membrane-bound IL-15-Fc cytokine fusion gene was subcloned into
pIRESpuro3 (Clontech) to obtain IL-15-Fc/pIRESpuro3.
Cell lines and primary human T cells. Daudi (Burkitt lymphoma) and
HLAnull K562 (erythroleukemia) cells were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection. Lymphoblastoid cells (LCL) were a kind gift of Dr. Helen
Heslop (Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston TX).
These cell lines were cultured in HyQ RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) supplemented with 2 mmol/L Glutamax-1 (Life Technologies-Invitrogen) and 10%
heat-inactivated defined FCS (Hyclone), referred to as culture medium (1).
Human T cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation over FicollPaque-Plus (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB), from umbilical cord blood or
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after consent, and were
cultured in culture medium.
Generation of aAPC. As previously reported, K562 cells were electroporated with DNA plasmids to enforce expression of all of the following:
truncated CD19, 4-1BBL, and MICA fused to GFP (18). These aAPCs were
further modified to express membrane-bound IL-15 to provide a cytokine
stimulus at the site of CAR-binding and T-cell costimulation (19).
Electroporation and T-cell coculture with aAPC. On day 0, PBMCs
and umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (107) were suspended in 100 AL
of Amaxa Nucleofector solution (CD34 kit) and mixed with 5 Ag of
supercoiled CoOpCD19RCD28/pT-MNDU3 and 5 Ag pCMV-SB11 DNA
plasmids, transferred to a cuvette, and electroporated (Program U-14).
After a 10-min room temperature incubation, the cells were transferred to a
six-well plate containing 3 to 4 mL incomplete phenol-free RPMI and rested
for 2 to 3 h. The cells were cultured overnight in 6 to 7 mL 10% phenol-free
RPMI and stimulated the next day (day 1) with g-irradiated (100 Gy) aAPC
at a 1:10 T cell/aAPC ratio. The g-irradiated aAPC were re-added every 7 d.
Recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhIL-2; Chiron) was added to the
cultures at 50 units/mL on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule,
beginning day 1 of each 7-d expansion cycle. The supercoiled plasmid
CoOpCD19RCD28/Hy-pVitro4 (expressing CAR under control of EF1a
promoter and Hy under control of CAG promoter) was electroporated
(10 Ag) into PBMCs (107) using Nucleofector technology and T cells were
propagated by cross-linking CD3 using an OKT3-mediated 14-d rapid
expansion protocol (REP) as described previously using allogeneic
g-irradiated PBC and LCL feeder cells in the presence of exogenous
(soluble) rhIL-2 (20). T cells were enumerated every 7 d, and viable cells
were counted based on trypan blue exclusion.
Western blot. Expression of the chimeric 66-kD (CD19R) and 79-kD
(CD19RCD28) CD3-~ was accomplished using a primary mouse anti-human
CD3-~ mAb (1 Ag/mL; BD Biosciences) and secondary horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:75,000; Pierce) under
reducing conditions, based on methods previously described (20). Protein
lysates were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane using iBlot Dry
Blotting System (Invitrogen) and developed with SuperSignal West Femto
Maximum Sensitivity substrate (Pierce) per the manufacturer’s instructions
and chemiluminescence was captured after 1-min exposure using VersaDoc
MP 4000 Imaging System (Bio-Rad).
Generation of monoclonal antibody recognizing a CD19-specific
CAR. Female BALB/c mice were injected six times in the foot at 3-d
intervals with syngeneic NS0 cells expressing CD19R CAR. Three days
after the last immunization, mice were sacrificed, popliteal lymph nodes
were removed, and cells were fused with P3-8AG-X653 myeloma cells at
a ratio of 3:5, using 30% polyethylene glycol 1450 (in serum free RPMI
containing 5% DMSO). After 10 d, hybridoma colonies were picked,
cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates, and 100 AL of supernatants
were screened by ELISA for differential binding to round-bottomed
96-plates containing adsorbed (105/well) CD19R+ and CD19Rneg Jurkat
cells as detected by 1:500 dilution of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Detection was achieved by TMB
Microwell peroxidase substrate system (KPL). Protein G column (Roche)

purified mAb was conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen-Molecular
Probes) per manufacturer’s instructions.
Flow cytometry. Fluorochrome-conjugated reagents were obtained
from BD Biosciences: anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD25, anti-CD27, antiCD28, anti-CD62L, anti-CD45RA, anti-CD45RO, and anti-CD95. Affinitypurified F(ab¶)2 fragment of FITC-conjugated goat anti-human Fcg
(Jackson Immunoresearch) was used at 1/20 dilution to detect cell
surface expression of CD19-specific CAR. Purified CAR-specific mAb clone
2D3, conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, was used at a dilution of 1/30, giving
a concentration of f30 Ag/mL. In some experiments, binding of this mAb
to the Fc region of CAR was blocked (30 min at 4jC) using goat human
Fc-specific antiserum (Sigma). Blocking of nonspecific antibody binding
was achieved using FACS wash buffer (2% FCS in PBS). T-cell receptor
(TCR)-Vh expression was determined with a panel of 24 TCR-Vh–specific
mAbs (IO TEST Beta Mark TCR-Vh repertoire kit, Beckman Coulter) used
in association with anti-CD3 and appropriate isotype-matched control
mAbs. Data acquisition was on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) using
CellQuest version 3.3 (BD Biosciences). Analyses and calculation of mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) was undertaken using FCS Express version
3.00.007 (Thornhill).
Intracellular IL-2 cytokine staining. Intracellular IL-2 was assayed
using the Intracellular Cytokine Staining Starter Kit (BD PharMingen) per
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 105 T cells were incubated with
0.5  106 stimulator cells in 200 AL culture medium along with protein
transport inhibitor (BD Golgi Plug containing Brefeldin A) in a 96-well plate.
Following a 4- to 6-h incubation at 37jC, the cells were stained for CAR
expression using hybridoma mAb clone 2D3 at 4jC for 30 min. After
washing, the cells were fixed and permeabilized (100 AL, Cytofix/Cytoperm
buffer) and phycoerythrin-conjugated mAb specific for IL-2 was added.
Cells were further washed and analyzed by FACSCalibur. T cells
were treated with a leukocyte activation cocktail (phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate and ionomycin) as a positive control.
Confocal microscopy. Jurkat parental and CD19R+ Jurkat cells were
stained with the hybridoma clone mAb 2D3, at a 1:50 dilution for 15 min at
4jC, washed in FACS wash buffer, and fixed with 0.1% paraformaldehyde.
After fixing, the cells were washed twice with FACS wash buffer and
transferred onto slides, and coverslips were mounted with Prolong Gold
anti-fade agent (Invitrogen). Cells were examined under a confocal
microscope (Leica TCS SP2-SE) using oil immersion lens (63 objective).
Single-scan images were obtained with a 4.76 zoom in a 1,024  1,024
format with a line averaging of 8.
Chromium release assay. The cytolytic activity of T cells was
determined by 4-h chromium release assay (1). CD19-specific T cells
were incubated with 5  103 51Cr-labeled target cells in a V-bottomed
96-well plate (Costar). The percentage of specific cytolysis was calculated
from the release of 51Cr, as described earlier, using a TopCount NXT
(Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Inc.). Data are reported as
mean F SD.
DNA PCR for SB transposon and transposase. DNA was isolated from
PBMC using the QIAmp DNA mini kit (Qiagen). PCR was carried out using
CD19RCD28-specific forward primer 5¶-AGATGACCCAGACCACCTCCAGC3¶ and reverse primer 5¶-GGTATCCTTGGTGGCGGTGCT-3¶ for the transposon. The PCR reaction used 1 Ag of DNA/sample in a mix containing
10 PCR buffer, 2.5 mmol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 3 Amol/L
MgCl2, and 0.5 units of DNA polymerase (AmpliTaq Gold, Applied
Biosystems) in a final volume of 50 AL amplified in a thermal Cycler
(PTC-200 DNA Engine Cycler, Bio-Rad). After an initial denaturation at 95jC
for 5 min, the samples underwent 34 cycles of 95jC for 30 s, 65jC for 30 s,
72jC for 1 min 15 s, followed by a prolonged extension step at 72jC for
7 min. For the transposase gene, PCR was carried out using SB11-specific
forward primer 5¶-ATGGGACCACGCAGCCG-3¶ and reverse primer 5¶CGTTTCGGGTAGCCTTCCACA-3¶. After an initial denaturation at 95jC
for 5 min, the samples underwent 34 cycles of 95jC for 15 s, 58jC for 30 s,
74jC for 2 min followed by a prolonged extension step at 74jC for 7 min.
The housekeeping gene GAPDH was also amplified in the same samples
using the forward primer 5¶-TCTCCAGAACATCATCCCTGCCAC-3¶ and
reverse primer 5¶-TGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCACCCTG-3¶.

0.075 mol/L KCl at room temperature for 15 min, fixed with acetic acid/
methanol (1:3), and washed thrice on a glass slide. For Giemsa (G)
banding, 5- to 6-d-old slides treated with trypsin were stained with
Giemsa stain following standard techniques described previously (21).
A total of 15 G-banded metaphases were photographed and 5 complete
karyotypes were prepared using a karyotyping system from Applied
Imaging Corporation.

Results
We describe a new approach to using nonviral gene transfer of
DNA plasmids to efficiently obtain populations of memory and
effector T cells with desired specificity (Fig. 1D). The system we
have devised provides for robust antigen-driven expansion of CD4+
and CD8+ CAR+ T cells to clinically meaningful numbers.
Monoclonal antibody with specificity for CD19-specific CAR.
The cell surface expression of the introduced CAR was predicted
to increase with outgrowth of T-cell populations that have
undergone CAR-mediated numerical expansion on CD19+ aAPC.
Currently, the only-commercially available flow cytometry
reagents that recognize our CARs are polyclonal anti-Fc antibodies raised in goat, but we desired a homogeneous monoclonal
product for use in the release of CAR+ T cells for clinical trials. To
longitudinally follow the transgene expression, we developed a
CAR-specific mAb by immunizing mice with syngeneic NS0 cells
expressing CD19R. A hybridoma mAb clone 2D3 (IgG1) was
selected by flow cytometry that selectively bound to CD19R+
Jurkat cells, but not parental Jurkat cells. The binding of 2D3 can

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

be blocked using a Fc-specific antibody (Fig. 2A). The 2D3 clone
bound a CD20-specific CAR that shares the IgG4 Fc region with
CD19R and CD19RCD28 (data not shown). The pattern of staining
by confocal microscopy showed 2D3 binding to CAR on the cell
surface (Fig. 2B). These data are consistent with a mAb binding
specifically to the CD19-specific CAR and recognizing the
modified human IgG Fc region. Of note, the production of this
mAb avoided the need to purity recombinant CAR protein as the
immunogen was genetically modified NS0 cells and the ELISA
screening used genetically modified Jurkat cells.
Electrotransfer of SB two-plasmid DNA system. We have used
a nonviral gene transfer approach to introduce codon optimized
DNA expression plasmids because these expression vectors can be
readily and cheaply manufactured to clinical grade. Although
codon modification of TCR genes has been shown to enhance
expression of transgenic TCR in primary human T cells (22), we
now show the usage of a codon optimized second-generation CAR.
Previously, our electroporation approach based on the Multiporator (Eppendorf; refs. 23, 24) used T cells that had been
stimulated to proliferate by cross-linking CD3 with OKT3 to allow
access of the introduced naked DNA to the nucleus after
dissolution of the nuclear envelope during prometaphase. However,
T cells nonspecially activated to proliferate, such as by cross-linking
CD3 as occurs in the REP (25), would preclude subsequent
immediate antigen-mediated propagation and thus directed
outgrowth of CAR+ T cells. Nucleofector technology has been used
to electroporate nonreplicating cells by direct transfer of DNA to
the nucleus (26). Thus, we investigated whether this electrotransfer
system could be used to genetically modify circulating T cells from
peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood, which are in a

quiescent state. To assist with subsequent translation to clinical
practice, the Nucleofector solution is available for use in cGMP.
Both the SB transposase and IR have been independently
manipulated to improve efficiency of transposition, but changes to
both do not generally seem to be additive. In preliminary
experiments, we too compared the relative transposition efficiency
of the SB10 (10, 16) and SB11 transposases (the latter exhibiting
improved enzymatic activity; ref. 17) in a two-by-two matrix using
the Amaxa 96-well Shuttle system to introduce these transposases
and pT (15, 16) and pT2 transposons (the latter exhibiting
improved transposition; ref. 27) into Jurkat T cells. As observed
with other cell lines, we found a similar increase in transposition
using SB11 with pT and using SB10 with pT2 (27) although, as
reported, overproduction of transposase inhibited transposition
(13, 17). When the pT2-improved transposon was combined with
SB11, no further increase in transgene expression was observed
over that achieved when these components were used with SB10 or
pT, respectively. In the present study, a combination of pT
transposon ( for integration) and SB11 transposase ( for transient
expression) was used for experiments with primary T cells.
Generation of CD19+ aAPC. We determined whether peripheral
blood and umbilical cord blood–derived T cells could be selectively
propagated by stimulating through an introduced immunoreceptor. This experiment would evaluate our underlying hypothesis of
whether the presence of the SB transposase would improve
efficiency of CAR transposon integration in T cells. Our initial
attempts at CAR-dependent T-cell propagation after electrotransfer
of the SB system used allogeneic LCL because these are widely
available as master cell banks (including at M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center) manufactured in compliance with cGMP for phase I/II
trials. However, these LCL resulted in nonspecific outgrowth of
CARnull T cells that had undergone electrotransfer of SB plasmids,
independent of CAR expression (data not shown), presumably due
to outgrowth of alloreactive T cells. Because our SB transposon by
design does not include a drug resistance gene, we avoided
nonspecific propagation of T cells using K562 as aAPC because
these do not express classical HLA molecules. K562 cells are widely
recognized as a platform suitable for the numerical expansion of
lymphocytes because they (a) can be cultured in compliance with
cGMP, (b) express desired endogenous T-cell costimulatory
molecules, (c) secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, and (d) can be

readily modified to enforce the expression of antigen and desired
endogenous T-cell costimulatory molecules (28, 29). To provide an
IL-15–mediated growth stimulus coordinated with recognition of
CD19 antigen, the aAPC expressing tCD19, 4-1BBL, and MICA were
further modified to express the IL-15 cytokine on the cell surface
(IL-15-Fc; Fig. 2A). Membrane-bound IL-15 has been used before to
propagate natural killer (NK) cells on K562 (19). The ability of these
K562 aAPCs to propagate CAR+ T cells after electrotransfer of SB
transposon and transposase plasmids is described in the next
section.
SB-mediated gene transfer of CAR transposon in primary
T cells. After using the Nucleofector to import plasmid DNA into
quiescent T cells, we observed that peripheral blood– and
umbilical cord blood–derived electroporated CD4+ and CD8+
T cells readily expressed the CAR transposon (Table 1; Fig. 3A).
Not surprisingly, the presence of the plasmid expressing the SB11
transposase did not increase transposon expression when
measured 24 hours after electroporation (22% and 27% CAR
expression with and without transposase, respectively), as this
early time point for assessing transgene expression records
transient nonintegrated CAR expression (Fig. 3A). The genotoxicity
reported with excess expression of SB transposase (17) was
apparently controlled in our two-plasmid system using a 1:1 ratio
of transposon and transposase. To obtain peripheral blood– and
umbilical cord blood–derived T cells with integrated transposon,
the genetically modified cells were cocultured with g-radiated
aAPC (K562 genetically modified to express tCD19, 4-1BBL, MICA,
IL-15-Fc) at a ratio of 1:10 (T cell to aAPC). After 5 weeks of
continuous coculture (g-radiated aAPC re-added every 7 days), the
percentage of peripheral blood–derived T cells expressing CAR
increased in the transposase-containing group (43%), whereas the
CAR expression was lost (0.7%) when transposon was electrotransferred in the absence of transposase (Fig. 3A). Thus, after 28
to 35 days, the efficiency of two DNA plasmid SB-mediated gene
transfer improved CAR expression by f49 to 60-fold, compared
with a single plasmid transposon control (Table 1). The expression
of the CAR was confirmed by Western blot of whole-cell lysates of
propagated T cells probed using a mAb specific for CD3-~ chain

endogenous ~ chain (Fig. 3C). To monitor for the presence or

Propagation of CAR+ T cells. The K562-derived aAPC was
calculated to give a 20-fold growth of genetically modified T cells
at the end of 4 weeks with continued and accelerated expansion
thereafter (Fig. 4A). A subset analysis revealed that populations
of both CD4+CAR+ and CD8+CAR+ T cells could be propagated
(Table 1). Initially, the rates of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell growth on
aAPC were similar, but after f8 weeks there was an outgrowth of
CD4+CAR+ T cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, continued time in tissue culture
could be used to derive CAR+ T cells with an increased CD4 to CD8
ratio. We also followed the percentage expression and density of
the CAR on the T-cell surface by flow cytometry. With coculture,
there was outgrowth of percentage of T cells expressing the CD19specific CAR (22% on day 1 and peaking at 99% on day 70).
However, as the percentage of CAR+ T cells increased, there was a
decrease in the density of CAR expression, as the MFI dropped
from a peak of 109 arbitrary units at 21 days, early in the
coculturing process, and then declined over culture time. The
amount of CAR for the population peaked at f70 days after

electroporation (percentage expression multiplied by MFI). Thus,
adding a fixed ratio of aAPC (with a fixed density of CD19 antigen)
to T cells seems to have supported the growth for populations of
T cells that either expressed high density of CAR or high percentage
of CAR.
Immunophenotype of CAR+ memory T cells. Previously, T cells
from healthy donors electroporated to express a CD19-specific CAR
and nonspecifically activated for proliferation by cross-linking CD3
with OKT3 using REP have shown a predominant phenotype
consistent with differentiated effector CD8+ T cells (20). In contrast,
after electrotransfer of SB plasmids and numerical expansion on
aAPC, T cells exhibited a heterogeneous immunophenotype and
apparently included populations of CAR+ TCM. We showed that the
CAR+ T cells expressed memory cell markers (CD27, CD28, CD62L;
refs. 30–32) as well as determinants of an effector-cell phenotype
(Fig. 3Bi). For example, over half of CD27+, CD28+, and CD62L+
T cells expressed CAR. Indeed, as a marker for TCM, 88% of the
CD62L+CD45RO+ cells expressed the CAR (Fig. 3Bii; ref. 33). Upon

cells by multiparameter flow cytometry gating on CD3+ lymphocytes. Phorbol

gating CD45RO+ cells, we observed a preferential expansion of
T cells with this memory-cell marker in the cultured SB-transfected
T cells (90%; MFI, 38) compared with unmanipulated T cells
obtained directly from PBMC (36%; MFI, 50). TEM and TCM have
also been distinguished based on relative expression of CD28 and
Fas (34). Using these markers, we were able to identify that
genetically modified and propagated TCM constituted f40% of the
total cell population and CD28negCD95+ TEM represented the
remainder of the propagated T cells. Multiparameter flow cytometry
further revealed that 39% of CAR+CD28+CD95+ TCM expressed
CD62L. In comparison, only 7% of the CAR+ TEM expressed CD62L
(Fig. 3Biii). These data reveal that CAR+ T cells are present in T cells
that express markers consistent with TCM. Preferential expansion of
T cells in tissue culture with an apparent memory phenotype can
also be inferred by from the ratio of CD45RA/CD45RO, which
decreased from 2.75 in unmanipulated freshly derived PBMC to
0.9 for SB-transfected and ex vivo propagated T cells (Fig. 3Bii).
The relative percentage increase of observed CD45RO+ cells, or
the decrease in CD45RA/CD45RO ratio, is presumably due to the
repetitive antigenic stimulation of cultured T cells resulting in
down-regulation of the high molecular weight CD45RA isoform and
reciprocal up-regulation of the low molecular weight isoform
CD45RO during time in culture. Coexpression of both CD45RA and
CD45RO has been associated with the phenotype of effector T cells
(35) but as in circulating peripheral blood–derived T cells express
both CD45RA and CD45RO, the markers are presumably also
present on memory cells. These data have implications for
improved in vivo efficacy as TCM are associated with long-term
persistence after adoptive transfer.
TCR VB repertoire. We tracked the expression of TCR Vh usage
by flow cytometry over time with the hypothesis that an
improvement in DNA-plasmid integration would be reflected by

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

maintenance of a broad pre-electroporation TCR Vh repertoire. The
pattern of TCR Vh usage observed after electrotransfer of the two
DNA SB plasmids and propagation on aAPC was much broader than
when T cells were electroporated using the single CoOpCD19RCD28/
Hy-pVitro4 plasmid and expanded by REP by cross-linking CD3 with
OKT3 in cytocidal concentrations of hygromycin B. We observed
that f80% of the T cells electroporated with CoOpCD19RCD28/HypVitro4 plasmid expressed a single TCR Vh family (Vh5.3). In
contrast, f80% of the T cells electroporated with the complete SB
system expressed 30% of the TCR Vh families (Fig. 4C). This is
consistent with less efficient integration of the CoOpCD19RCD28/HypVitro4 plasmid compared with the SB system. These data have
implications for design of adoptive immunotherapy trials as
maintaining a broad TCR diversity is desired to restore immune
reconstitution after myeloablative preparative regimens.
Redirected function of CAR+ T cells after electrotransfer of
SB plasmids. The numerically expanded T cells were evaluated for
redirected killing. The genetically modified T cells were able to lyse
CD19+ targets, and specificity of killing was shown by the
background lysis of CD19neg K562 cells (Fig. 5A). We showed a
25-fold increase in specific lysis of CD19+ K562 at effector-to-target
ration of 50:1. The lack of killing of CD19neg K562 is consistent with
absence of resident NK cell function in the culture, as these target
cells are sensitive to NK cell–mediated lysis. Because the CAR
contains a CD28 endodomain, we investigated whether T cell–
derived IL-2 could be produced when CAR contacted CD19 antigen
in the absence of binding CD80 or CD86. An intracellular cytokine
assay showed that IL-2 could be detected in the CAR+ T cells only
when cultured with CD19+ stimulator cells and not with CD19neg
cells (Fig. 5B). There was an f4-fold increase in IL-2 expression
when CAR+ T cells were stimulated by CD19+CD80negCD86neg K562
cells compared with CD19neg K562 parental controls. No significant

IL-2 production was observed when T cells were cultured in absence
of stimulator cells. These data are consistent with activation of
T cells for killing and IL-2 cytokine production through the CAR.
Lack of integration of SB11 transposase in propagated
T cells. Continued presence of the SB11 transposase in genetically
modified T cells may cause genotoxicity. We evaluated for the
presence of integrated transposase plasmid by genomic PCR. No
band corresponding to the SB11 transposase gene (size f830 bp)
was detected in T cells that were electroporated with the SB
transposon and transposase and had undergone 4 weeks of
coculture with aAPC (Fig. 6A), which is consistent with the rapid
loss of transposase expression activity over the first few days
postdelivery in mice (36). These results indicate that the SB11
transposase was not integrated into the genome of cells stably
expressing the CD19RCD28 CAR.
Karyotype of genetically modified T cells. As a measure of
global genotoxicity associated with undesired and continued
transposition, we evaluated the integrity of the chromosome
structure. G-banding analysis of the SB-transfected T cells showed
a normal female karyotype, 46, XX with no apparent numerical or
structural chromosome alterations (Fig. 6B). Although this does not
exclude chromosomal damage below the limit of detection of this
technique, it supports the premise that SB transposition in T cells is
not associated with translocations and chromosomal aberrations.

Discussion
We have previously showed that peripheral blood– and umbilical
cord blood–derived T cells can be rendered specific for CD19, based
on using a CAR capable of providing a fully competent activation
signal, development of aAPC-expressing antigen, and desired
costimulatory signals. In this report, we describe the use of SB
transposon/transposase plasmids to introduce CD19-specific CAR
leading to efficient outgrowth of CAR+ T cells on aAPC with
preservation of CD4+, CD8+, central memory, and effector-cell
immunophenotypes. This is expected to be of widespread interest
as many institutions are evaluating the clinical potential of
genetically modified T cells with redirected specificity. The majority
of these programs use recombinant viral vectors, which, although
efficient at gene transfer, are generally cost-prohibitive to
manufacture to clinical grade and still permit incremental changes
to clinical trial design. Yet, at this early stage of gene therapy
planning with clinical grade T cells, what is needed, and is provided
here, is a cost-effective gene transfer system that encourages
reiterative changes to expression vector and/or CAR design to be
used in proof-of-concept clinical trials that support hypothesis
testing from the bench to the bedside and back again. The
approximate cost for manufacture and release of a clinical grade
plasmid DNA is between $20,000 and $40,000 depending on
supplier and degree of release testing needed. This release testing
typically requires restriction enzyme analyses, sequencing, and
measures of (a) homogeneity/purity/contamination (protein, RNA,
and other DNA) and (b) sterility including endotoxin. For earlyphase proof-of-concept trials, this pricing compares favorably with
the relatively high cost of recombinant retrovirus, including
lentivirus as manufacture and release of clinical grade viruses
may exceed 10 times the cost of DNA-plasmid production.
Furthermore, there is downward pressure on the unit cost for
DNA because there are many vendors worldwide with the
capability to produce clinical grade plasmids. The manufacture/
release of recombinant retrovirus is highly specialized, requiring

the expertise of a small number of GMP facilities that contributes
to high cost and can introduce delays to production and thus
availability for clinical use.
Previously, the relatively low levels of nonviral gene transfer
efficiency to introduce naked DNA plasmid coding CAR transgene,
compared with viral-mediated transduction, has been compensated by lengthy periods of ex vivo tissue culture to select-out T cells
expressing drug-metabolizing enzymes. Thus, an attractive feature
of the SB gene transfer system to introduce CAR into T cells is
avoidance of the need to express immunogenic section genes, such
as bacteria-derived Hy transgene. Some human-derived drugresistant transgenes are available for use in hematopoietic cells
(37, 38), but they typically incorporate amino acid changes from the
native protein sequence that may compromise their inability to
remain nonimmunogenic and the continued presence of chemoselective drugs may slow kinetics of ex vivo numerical expansion
and alter T-cell function.
Coupling electrotransfer of SB system with selective propagation
of CAR+ T cells was made possible using K562 cells that had been

genetically modified to express costimulatory molecules to
function as aAPC. We have previously shown that the presence of
4-1BBL and MICA on CD19+ K562 could propagate CD19R+ T cells
(18). However, sustained antigen-driven numerical expansion of
genetically modified T cells on aAPC has required the presence of
rhIL-15 (18). In our current experiments, we found that the
exogenous addition of this soluble cytokine led to nonspecific
stimulation of T cells after electrotransfer, especially because there
was no concomitant drug selection, resulting in the outgrowth of
T cells that did not maintain CAR expression (data not shown).
This could be corrected by expression of IL-15 at the interface
between aAPC and T cells, using membrane-bound IL-15, as has
been shown for the survival/propagation of NK cells (19, 39). This
approach of expressing IL-15 on the cell surface has the further
advantage of avoiding rhIL-15 protein that is not yet readily/widely
available for use in clinical trials. Allogeneic LCL are another
source of CD19+ aAPC to propagate CD19-specific T cells and are
available to many centers operating facilities in compliance with
cGMP as a master cell bank. However, the presence of HLA led to
stimulation of T cells through activation of allospecific TCR and
subsequent outgrowth of T cells that lacked CAR expression. This
alloimmune response could be avoided using the K562 as aAPC, as
these cells lack endogenous class I and II MHC (29).
Next-generation clinical trials using genetically modified T cells
are expected to infuse predefined populations of T cells with defined
characteristics such as the inclusion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
and TCM. There is convincing clinical data that the presence of CD4+
T-helper cells improves the persistence of CD8+ antigen-specific T
cells (40). Furthermore, clinical trials using melanoma-specific
T cells have shown in vivo long-term persistence of subpopulations
of infused CD28+ memory T cells (41) and human experience
has shown a preference for the selective survival of autologous
HIV-specific CD27+ versus CD27neg adoptively transferred T cells
(31). These data are supported by nonhuman experiments
in which adoptive transfer of ex vivo propagated macaque
CD28+CD95+CD62L+ TCM resulted in longer in vivo persistence
compared with infusion of numerically expanded effector T cells
(34). We note that the electrotransfer of SB plasmids and subsequent
CAR-mediated propagation on aAPC supports the outgrowth of
T cells with these desired phenotypes as our CAR+ T cells maintain
expression of CD27, CD28, CD45RO, CD95, and CD62L. Clinical trials
will be needed to determine whether adoptive transfer of these CAR+
T cells with an apparent central memory immunophenotype
(CD28+CD95+CD62L+) results in long-term in vivo persistence of
genetically modified T cells or whether these cells, despite being
maintained for weeks in culture, will differentiate after infusion into
effector T cells with limited in vivo survival. Clinical experience will
also be needed to assess whether the presence of CD62L (L-selectin)
on genetically modified T cells enables CAR+ T cells to traffic to sites
of minimal residual disease for B-lineage malignancies, such as
secondary lymphoid organs (42, 43).
Although there are a variety of transposase/transposon expression vectors available, we elected to combine the improved
enzymatic activity of the SB11 transposase with pT IR sequences,
rather than less efficient SB10 transposase with pT2 plasmid
containing IR with improved IR activity. This was based on (a) the
observation that integrated SB11 transposase could not be detected
after T-cell culture on aAPC and (b) the assumption that because the
CAR transposon with flanking IR is to be integrated, we wished to
reduce the potential for introducing an element with increased
potential for retransposition and potential deleterious chromosomal

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

rearrangement. We note that the majority of viral vectors currently
used in human gene therapy trials also contain elements flanking
transgene to be integrated, such as the long terminal repeat (LTR)
termini of recombinant retrovirus, with binding sites for enzymes
with integrase activity. The transfer of retroviral-derived LTR has not
been associated with deleterious host genome chromosome
rearrangements, especially in T cells (44), and the low risk of
genotoxicity due to the integrated presence of SB IR should be on par
with retrovirally mediated transduction.
A gene transfer event with stable integration could result in
deleterious insertional mutagenesis, but for SB transposition this
seems to be less than retrovirally mediated transduction given
the observed preference for random chromosomal integration at
TA-dinucleotide base pairs areas. Although the safety of SB
transposition can only be adequately addressed in clinical trials,
we have not seen major chromosomal aberrations after electrotransfer of SB plasmids. Furthermore, to safeguard against the
emergence of genetically modified T cells with autonomous growth,
we routinely culture T cells after electroporation without aAPC and
we are yet to observe evidence of antigen-independent proliferation. The risks for first-in-human trials using SB system would
seem to be ameliorated when using T cells, rather than
hematopoietic progenitor cells and in the setting of high-risk
malignancies in which patients are expected to succumb to
underlying relapsed malignancies. The risks of genotoxicity may be
reduced in the future using a transposase with directed integration
(45, 46), coupling persistent transposase activity with a transgene
mediating conditional suicide, or introducing mRNA (47) rather
than DNA coding for the transposase.
The future for clinical therapy infusing genetically modified
T cells with redirected specificity looks promising. There are
published reports on the therapeutic effect of T cells genetically
modified to express full-length ahTCR (48) and clinical studies
using T cells expressing chimeric receptors to redirect specificity
have been reported or are under way (35, 49, 50). With the
results of the first in-human trial infusing CD19-specific T cells
being reported (3), the next step (the so-called second
translational hurdle) will be expanding these single-institution
experiences to multi-institution trials powered for efficacy. The
platform we describe for producing CAR+ T cells should be
appealing to investigators undertaking single-site as well as
multisite trials using gene transfer of immunoreceptor(s) to
redirect the specificity of T cells, including TCM. The system we
have developed uses technology that is readily accessible and
practiced in compliance with cGMP for phase I/II trials because
we use (a) DNA plasmids, (b) electroporation using a
commercial device, (c) weekly addition of irradiated immortalized aAPC feeder cells derived from K562 (which are available
for use in cGMP), and (d) addition of exogenous rhIL-2
purchased through pharmacy stores.
In conclusion, we report a new gene transfer approach for the
clinical application of T cells with redirected specificity for
desired antigens. It is anticipated that this approach will be of
interest not just for generating clinical grade T cells with
specificity for CD19, but for genetically modifying T cells to
express CAR with alternative specificities as well as for
introducing TCR transgenes. Most adoptive immunotherapy
trials that have shown therapeutic efficacy, e.g., to melanoma,
CMV, EBV, and adenoviral antigens, have all used an in vitro
antigen-driven proliferation step to propagate antigen-specific
T cells before infusion. We have now incorporated ex vivo
