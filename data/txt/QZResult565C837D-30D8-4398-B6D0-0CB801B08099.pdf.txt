Abstract
Combining immunotherapy with targeted therapy blocking oncogenic BRAFV600 may result in improved
treatments for advanced melanoma. In this study, we developed a BRAFV600E-driven murine model of melanoma,
SM1, which is syngeneic to fully immunocompetent mice. SM1 cells exposed to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib
(PLX4032) showed partial in vitro and in vivo sensitivity resulting from the inhibition of MAPK pathway signaling.
Combined treatment of vemurafenib plus adoptive cell transfer therapy with lymphocytes genetically modiﬁed with
a T-cell receptor (TCR) recognizing chicken ovalbumin (OVA) expressed by SM1-OVA tumors or pmel-1 TCR
transgenic lymphocytes recognizing gp100 endogenously expressed by SM1 resulted in superior antitumor
responses compared with either therapy alone. T-cell analysis showed that vemurafenib did not signiﬁcantly alter
the expansion, distribution, or tumor accumulation of the adoptively transferred cells. However, vemurafenib
paradoxically increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, in vivo cytotoxic activity, and
intratumoral cytokine secretion by adoptively transferred cells. Taken together, our ﬁndings, derived from 2 independent models combining BRAF-targeted therapy with immunotherapy, support the testing of this therapeutic
combination in patients with BRAFV600 mutant metastatic melanoma. Cancer Res; 72(16); 3928–37. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Targeted therapies that block driver oncogenic mutations in
BRAFV600 result in unprecedentedly high response rates and
improved overall survival in patients with advanced melanoma
(1–4). However, these responses are usually of limited durability, which is a common feature of most oncogene-targeted
therapies for cancer. Conversely, many tumor immunotherapy
strategies induce low-frequency, but extremely durable, tumor
responses, frequently lasting years (5–7). The ability to combine both treatment approaches could merge the beneﬁts of
high response rates with targeted therapies and durable
response rates with immunotherapies.

Combining immunotherapy with BRAF inhibitors, such as
vemurafenib (formerly PLX4032 or RG7204) or dabrafenib
(formerly GSK2118436), 2 highly active agents for the treatment of BRAFV600 mutant melanoma, is supported by conceptual advantages and emerging experiences (8–10) that warrant
the testing of such combinations in animal models. It has been
reported that BRAF inhibitors may synergize with tumor
immunotherapy by the increased expression of melanosomal
tumor-associated antigens following inhibition of the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (8). In addition,
there are potential theoretical limitations to such a combination, because blocking signaling through the MAPK pathway
may alter lymphocyte activation or effector functions. However, when tested at a wide range of concentrations in vitro and
in vivo, BRAF inhibitors do not have signiﬁcant adverse effects
on human T lymphocyte functions (9, 11), and patients treated
with BRAF inhibitors have increased intratumoral inﬁltrates by
CD8þ T cells soon after therapy (10). Further, RAF inhibitors
can have a paradoxical effect of activating the MAPK pathway
through the transactivation of CRAF by a partially blocked
wild-type (WT) CRAF–BRAF dimmer (12–14). This phenomenon of paradoxical MAPK activation is the molecular basis for
the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in
patients treated with BRAF inhibitors (15), and it could be
evident in activated T cells as upstream activation of TCRs has
a potent effect of activating RAS-GTP leading to enhanced
CRAF–BRAF dimerization.
Previously, no implantable syngeneic BRAFV600E-driven
murine melanoma model able to grow progressively in a fully
immunocompetent and widely used mouse strain had been

Immunosensitization with BRAF Inhibitors

described. We derived such a cell line from mice transgenic for
the BRAFV600E mutation with restricted expression in melanocytes, resulting in a murine melanoma model syngeneic to
C57BL/6 mice. This model allowed us to test the concept of
immunosensitization (16) by combining the vemurafenibinduced inhibition of driver oncogenic BRAFV600E signaling
with adoptive cell transfer (ACT) immunotherapy. Vemurafenib meets most of the criteria as an immune-sensitizing agent
(16). In humans, it selectively inhibits a driver oncogene in
cancer cells (17), which is neither present nor required for the
function of lymphocytes (9). It results in rapid melanoma cell
death in humans as evidenced by a high frequency of early
tumor responses in patients (1, 18). The antitumor activity may
increase the expression of tumor antigens directly by tumor
cells (8), or enhance the cross-presentation of tumor antigens
from dying cells to antigen-presenting cells. In addition, the
profound and selective antitumor effects of vemurafenib
against BRAFV600 mutant melanoma cells may result in a more
permissive tumor microenvironment allowing for an improved
effector function of CTLs, which may be further enhanced by a
direct effect of paradoxical MAPK activation. Using 2 different
TCR transgenic cell ACT models, we tested the concept of
immunosensitization with vemurafenib, showing an improvement of the antitumor effects using the combination over
either single-agent therapy alone.

Materials and Methods
Mice, cell lines, and reagents
Breeding pairs of C57BL/6 (Thy1.2, Jackson Laboratories,
Bar Harbor, ME), pmel-1 (Thy1.1) transgenic mice (kind gift
from Dr. Nicholas Restifo, Surgery Branch, National Cancer
Institute, Bethesda, MD), NOD/SCID/g chainnull (NSG) mice
(NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), and mice transgenic for BRAFV600E mutation expression in melanocytes (kind gift from Drs. Philip Hinds and Frank
Haluska, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA) were bred and
kept under deﬁned-ﬂora pathogen-free conditions at the Association for the Assessment & Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care-approved animal facility of the Division of Experimental Radiation Oncology, UCLA, and used under the UCLA
Animal Research Committee protocol #2004-159. The SM1
murine melanoma was generated from a spontaneously arising
tumor in BRAFV600E mutant transgenic mice. The tumor was
minced and ﬁrst implanted into NSG mice, and then serially
implanted into C57BL/6 mice for in vivo experiments. Part of
the minced tumor was plated under tissue culture conditions
for deriving the SM1 cell line. When used in vitro, SM1 was
maintained in RPMI (Mediatech) with 10% fetal calf serum
(Omega Scientiﬁc), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 1%
(v/v) penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin (Omega Scientiﬁc). Sequencing for BRAFV600E mutation was carried out as
previously described (19). SM1-OVA was generated by stable
expression of OVA through lentiviral transduction as previously described (20). A plasmid expressing the 2 chains of an
MHC–I-restricted TCR speciﬁc for OVA (OT-1) was a kind gift
of David Baltimore (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA; ref. 21). The plasmid was recloned to express a F2A

www.aacrjournals.org

picornavirus sequence between the TCR chains for high
expression upon transduction of murine splenocytes using a
murine stem cell virus retroviral vector as previously described
(22, 23). M202, M229, and M233 are previously described human
melanoma cell lines (19). Vemurafenib (also known as PLX4032,
RG7204, or RO5185426) was obtained under a materials transfer agreement with Plexxikon Inc. (Berkeley, CA). Vemurafenib
was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; Fisher Scientiﬁc)
and used for in vitro studies as previously described (19). For
in vivo studies, vemurafenib was dissolved in DMSO, followed
by PBS (100 mL), which was then injected daily intraperitoneally
(i.p) into mice at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Because the original
formulation of vemurafenib is poorly bioavailable (1, 15), we
used a dosing regimen i.p. that has been shown to have
adequate pharmacokinetic parameters in blood (24).
SM1 oncogenic analysis
BRAFV600E sequencing was carried out as previously
described (19). Copy number analysis was conducted using
a mouse high-density genotyping array (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine) and data was genotyped with the R
MouseDivGeno (v1.03) software package (25). To detect
regions of copy number alteration, we selected the subset of
"chippable" invariant genomic probes (i.e., exon 1 probes;
ref. 25). Normalized and log2 transformed data was segmented
using circular binary segmentation algorithm in the R DNAcopy package (26). The minimum number of markers for a
changed segment was set at 5, with a 0.0005 signiﬁcance level to
accept a change-point. The segmented data was visualized in
the Integrative Genomics Viewer (27). For comparison to
human melanoma, we compared this data to copy number
alterations observed in 108 human melanoma short-term
cultures and cell lines (28).
Cell viability assays
Murine and human melanoma cells, na€ve C57BL/6 splenocytes, or activated pmel-1 splenocytes were seeded in 96-well
ﬂat-bottom plates (5  103 cells/well) with 100 mL of 10% fetal
calf serum media and incubated for 24 hours. Graded dilutions
of vemurafenib or DMSO vehicle control, in culture medium,
were added to each well in triplicate and analyzed following the
MTS assay (Promega).
ACT therapy in vivo models
For the OVA model, SM1-OVA tumors were implanted s.c. in
C57BL/6 mice. When tumors reached 5 to 8 mm in diameter,
mice were conditioned for ACT with a lymphodepleting regimen of 500 cGy of total body irradiation and then received 1 
106 C57BL/6-derived splenocytes i.v. that had been genetically
modiﬁed to express the OT-1 TCR by retroviral transduction as
previously described (22, 23). For the pmel-1 model, C57BL/6
mice with previously implanted SM1 tumors were treated with
lymphodepleting total body irradiation, i.v. injection of 1  106
gp10025-33 peptide-activated pmel-1 splenocytes and subcutaneous vaccination with gp10025-33 peptide-pulsed dendritic
cells when tumors reached 5 to 8 mm in diameter as previously
described (29, 30). In both cases, the ACT was followed by
3 days of daily i.p. administration of 50,000 IU of interleukin

2 (IL-2). Tumors were followed by caliper measurements 3
times per week.
Flow cytometric analysis
SM1 tumors harvested from mice were digested with collagenase and DNase (Sigma-Aldrich). Splenocytes and tumorinﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL), obtained from digested SM1
tumors, were stained with antibodies to CD8a (CalTag), CD3,
CD4, Thy1.1 (Becton Dickinson Biosciences), OVA/H-2Kb tetramer, or gp10025-33/H-2Db tetramer (Beckman Coulter), and
analyzed with LSR-II or FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometers (Becton
Dickinson Biosciences), followed by analysis using Flow-Jo
software (Tree-Star) as previously described (30). Intracellular
interferon gamma (IFN-g) staining was done as previously
described (30).
Immunoﬂuorescence imaging
Staining was carried out as previously described (23). Brieﬂy,
sections of OCT (Sakura Finetek) cryopreserved tissues were
blocked in donkey serum/PBS and incubated with primary
antibodies to CD8 or Thy1.1 (Becton Dickinson Biosciences),
followed by secondary donkey anti-rat antibodies conjugated to
DyLight 488 (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) or streptavidin-conjugated FITC (Invitrogen). Negative controls consisted of isotype matched rabbit or rat immunoglobulin G in
lieu of the primary antibodies listed above. Then, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used for the visualization of
nuclei. Immunoﬂuorescence images were taken in a ﬂuorescence microscope (Axioplan-2; Carl Zeiss Microimaging).
In vivo cytotoxicity assay
The assay was conducted as previously described (30). In
brief, splenocytes from na€ve WT C57BL/6 mice were pulsed
with 50 mg/mL of gp10025-33 peptide or the same amount
of control OVA257-264 peptide. After 1 hour of incubation,
gp10025-33-pulsed WT splenocytes were labeled with
6 nmol/L CFSE for 10 minutes at 37 C, whereas control
OVA257-264-pulsed splenocytes were differentially labeled
with a 10-fold dilution of CFSE (0.6 nmol/L). Cells were
injected i.v. into experimental mice at 16 days after pmel-1
adoptive cell transfer. After 10 hours, 3 mice per group were
sacriﬁced and their spleens examined for the presence of
CFSE-labeled cells. Percent cytotoxic activity was calculated
as number of live gp10025-33 pulsed splenocytes divided by
the number of live OVA257-264 pulsed splenocytes, which
were distinguished on the basis of the 10-fold difference in
CSFE ﬂuorescence by ﬂow cytometry.
Bioluminescence imaging
Pmel-1 splenocytes were retrovirally transduced to express
ﬁreﬂy luciferase as previously described (29), and used for ACT.
Bioluminescence imaging was carried out with a Xenogen IVIS
200 Imaging System (Xenogen/Caliper Life Sciences) as previously described (22, 23).
Micro-PET/computed tomography imaging
Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoﬂurane. PET was conducted 1 hour after intravenous administration of 200 mCi of

[18F]FDG, [18F]D-FAC, or [18F]FHBG and mice were scanned
using a FOCUS 220 micro-PET scanner (Siemens; energy
window of 350 to 750 keV and timing window of 6 ns) as
previously described (23).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism (version 5) software (GraphPad Software). A Mann–Whitney U test or ANOVA
with Bonferroni post-test was used to analyze experimental
data. Survival curves were generated by actuarial Kaplan–
Meier method and analyzed with the Jump-In software (SAS)
with log-rank test for comparisons from the time of tumor
challenge to when mice were sacriﬁced due to tumors reaching
14 mm in maximum diameter, or the end of the study period
had been reached.

Results
Derivation of a BRAFV600E mutated murine melanoma
syngeneic to C57BL/6 mice
The cell line SM1 was derived from a spontaneously arising
melanoma from a mouse with the BRAFV600E oncogene speciﬁcally expressed by melanocytes. These mice had been
generated by germline insertion of the BRAFV600E gene downstream of the murine tyrosinase locus control region (promoter enhancer) as described previously (31). These melanocytesspeciﬁc BRAFV600E transgenic mice had been backcrossed for
more than 20 generations with C57BL/6 mice. It has been
previously described that mice carrying transgenic BRAFV600E
develop melanocytic hyperplasia histologically reminiscent of
human nevi, and develop spontaneous melanomas with low
penetrance due to the dominant oncogenic senescence effect
of BRAFV600E (31). Cross-breeding them with CDKN2A or p53deﬁcient mice increases the frequency of melanoma development (31), but we found that the resulting tumors could not be
grown in C57BL/6 mice (data not shown) possibly due to
innate responses against mixed-background minor antigens
from the 2 transgenic strains. To optimize the chances of
establishing a progressively growing tumor, we ﬁrst passaged
the original SM1 cells in deeply immune-deﬁcient NSG mice,
and from there we were able to implant and develop progressively growing tumors in fully immunocompetent C57BL/6
mice.
SM1 is a vemurafenib-moderately sensitive BRAFV600E
mutant melanoma
Sequencing of the hotspot T1799A mutation in BRAF showed
the presence of the BRAFV600E transversion in SM1 cells (Fig.
1a). Whole-genome copy number analysis showed multiple
genomic aberrations in SM1, with frequent deletions and
ampliﬁcations (Supplementary Fig. S1A), which is a common
ﬁnding in human melanomas. Among target genes of interest,
SM1 has deletion of CDKN2A and ampliﬁcation of BRAF and
MITF genes (Supplementary Fig. S1B), events that are also
frequently observed in human melanoma (Supplementary Fig.
S1C). We tested the antitumor effects of single-agent vemurafenib against SM1 by in vitro MTS cell proliferation assay after
72 hours of treatment. The 50% inhibition concentration (IC50)

of vemurafenib was 14 mmol/L, which is approximately one log
higher than the sensitivity of M229 (IC50 of 0.5 mmol/L), a
BRAFV600E mutant human melanoma cell line highly sensitive
to vemurafenib, and at a similar range as the relatively resistant
BRAFV600E mutant human melanoma cell line M233 (IC50 of 15
mmol/L). SM1 was more sensitive to vemurafenib than the
NRASQ61L mutant (and BRAF WT) M202 and M207 cell lines
(IC50 >200 mmol/L; Fig. 1B). Despite its relative resistance in
MTS assays, SM1 responded to vemurafenib in vitro as showed
by a profound G1 arrest effect (Fig. 1C), and evidence of
apoptotic cell death with increasing concentrations (Fig.
1D). Further, the exposure of SM1 to vemurafenib resulted in
the expected effects of inhibiting downstream MAPK pathway
signaling with additional inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling
(Fig. 1E), similar to that previously described in BRAFV600E
mutant human melanoma cell lines (19, 32). SM1 tumors

established subcutaneously in C57BL/6 mice responded to
single-agent vemurafenib with a growth delay compared with
the progressive tumor growth in mice treated with vehicle
control (Fig. 1F). As with our prior results in tests conducted
on human lymphocytes (9), increasing concentrations of
vemurafenib did not negatively alter the viability of murine
lymphocytes (Fig. 2A). Further, analysis for pERK showed
paradoxical MAPK activation, shown by increase in pERK,
most notably at 1 and 5 mmol/L, when murine splenocytes
were exposed to vemurafenib and assayed 24 hours later
(Fig. 2b). Because the response to single-agent vemurafenib
was not complete and this BRAF inhibitor did not negatively
affect murine splenocytes, we hypothesized that SM1 would
be a useful model to test the potential beneﬁcial effects of
adding an immunotherapy strategy to the treatment with
vemurafenib.

Combined therapy with vemurafenib and ACT
immunotherapy improves antitumor responses against
SM1 tumors
We generated a mouse model targeting the model tumor
antigen OVA. We stably expressed OVA in SM1 cells to generate
SM1-OVA for studies of ACT with splenocytes expressing a
TCR speciﬁc for OVA (Fig. 3A and 3B). Lymphodepleted
C57BL/6 mice with established subcutaneous SM1-OVA
tumors received ACT of splenocytes obtained from C57BL/6
mice genetically modiﬁed with a retroviral vector expressing
the 2 chains of the OVA-speciﬁc TCR (Fig. 3C and 3D). We
titrated the conditions of this immunotherapy to provide a
suboptimal antitumor activity (similar in range to single-agent
vemurafenib) to allow the testing of the beneﬁts of the combination. In 2 replicate experiments, the combined therapy of
vemurafenib and OT-1 TCR-engineered splenocyte ACT was
consistently superior to either therapy alone (Fig. 3E), and it
improved survival (Fig. 3F; P ¼ 0.0004 by log rank test).
As the OVA model is based on the recognition of a foreign
antigen, we decided to conﬁrm the results in the pmel-1 ACT
model (Fig. 4A). The pmel-1 model is based on T cells transgenic for a TCR recognizing the murine melanosomal antigen
gp100 (33), which is endogenously expressed by SM1 (Fig. 4B).
In 3 replicate experiments, the combined therapy with pmel-1
ACT and vemurafenib provided superior antitumor activity
compared with either therapy alone, which had been titrated to
provide a suboptimal response against established SM1

Vemurafenib does not alter the tumor antigen or MHC
expression by SM1 cells
A hypothesized mechanism of improved antitumor activity
of combining BRAF targeted therapy with immunotherapy is
an increase in tumor antigen or MHC expression by cancer
cells (8). Therefore, we tested whether exposure to vemurafenib increased the expression of the gp100 melanoma tumor
antigen or the expression of surface MHC molecules, as well as
the recognition by TCR transgenic cells speciﬁc for gp100.
However, vemurafenib did not signiﬁcantly alter gp100 tumor
antigen expression by SM1 cells (Fig. 4B). The baseline expression of the MHC molecule H2-Db was very low in cultured SM1
cells, and it did not signiﬁcantly change on exposure to
vemurafenib (Supplementary Fig. S2).
No difference in T-cell number, distribution, and tumor
targeting of ACT therapy when combined with
vemurafenib
It has been reported that biopsies of some patients treated
with BRAF inhibitors have increased CD8 inﬁltrates (10). To
analyze whether vemurafenib expanded or changed the distribution of adoptively transferred cells in vivo with higher
accumulation in tumors, we analyzed their presence in spleens,
tumor-draining lymph nodes, and tumors. However, in our
model there was no evidence of either a systemic (spleen or
lymph nodes) or local (tumor) increase in the quantity of
adoptively transferred antitumor T cells with treatment with
vemurafenib (Fig. 5A and 5B; Supplementary Fig. S3A and 3B).
To rule out the possibility that we were missing an effect by not
analyzing the whole animal, we genetically labeled the adoptively transferred cells with the ﬁreﬂy luciferase transgene to
allow their in vivo tracking using bioluminescence imaging.
Again, there was no evidence of a differential expansion or in
vivo distribution and tumor targeting by the adoptively transferred pmel-1 cells when mice were treated with vemurafenib
(Fig. 5C). The quantitative analysis of luciferase activity over

visualize a differential systemic immune response using the

BRAFV600E mutation. In 3 replicate experiments the ACT of
pmel-1 cells induced potent cytotoxic effects against splenocytes pulsed with the gp100 peptide, but not against the control
OVA peptide. The cytotoxicity increased with systemic treatment with vemurafenib when analyzed at limiting numbers of
adoptively transferred pmel-1 cells (Fig. 6A), but not when the
number of pmel-1 cells adoptively transferred was 1 log higher
and the pmel-1 cells already had a very high lytic activity
against gp100 peptide pulsed splenocytes (Supplementary Fig.
S5). We then analyzed the activation state of TILs by detecting
cytokine production. In 2 replicate experiments, TIL collected
from mice treated with the combination showed a higher
ability to respond to short-term ex vivo restimulation with the
gp100 antigen, as assessed by IFN-g secretion (Fig. 6B; Sup-

increased the functionality of adoptively transferred pmel-1
cells in terms of their ability to release an immune stimulating
cytokine and intrinsic antigen-speciﬁc lytic activity.

Discussion
The two approaches with high response rates for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma are BRAF inhibitors and lymphocyte ACT therapies with ex vivo expanded
melanoma-speciﬁc T cells (1, 18, 35). However, in both cases,
tumors frequently relapse after an initial response (18, 36).
Our data supporting the combination of ACT with vemurafenib provides a strong rationale to translate combined

immunotherapy and targeted therapy for patients with
BRAFV600 mutant metastatic melanoma. The scientiﬁc rationale for combinations of targeted therapies and immunotherapy is based on the notion that pharmacologic interventions
with speciﬁc inhibitors of oncogenic events in cancer cells
could sensitize cancer cells to immune attack, which has been
termed immunosensitization (16). An immune-sensitizing
agent should ideally block key oncogenic events in cancer
cells, resulting in an increase in cell-surface ligands for immune
effector cells, and induce an intracellular pro-apoptotic cancer
cell milieu, which would enhance the ability of immune effector
cells such as CTLs and natural killer cells to recognize and kill
cancer cells. At the same time, immune-sensitizing agents
should not impair the viability or function of immune effector
cells (16). Most of these desired features could be fulﬁlled by
speciﬁc BRAF inhibitors currently used in patients with
BRAFV600 mutant metastatic melanoma (8–10).

We explored the potential mechanisms by which vemurafenib could improve the antitumor activity of adoptively
transferred T cells in 2 animal models. Our studies show that
this BRAF inhibitor does not change the cell expansion or
distribution of adoptively transferred cells by morphologic and
molecular imaging studies. However, lymphocytes exposed to
vemurafenib have higher pERK, which is a key feature of an
activated MAPK signaling pathway. Further, we noted an
immune cell-intrinsic ability to increase the cytotoxic function
of antigen-speciﬁc T cells, and TILs from vemurafenib-treated
mice had higher functional activation with increased ability to
release the immune-stimulating cytokine IFN-g following antigen re-exposure. These immune-activating effects of vemurafenib can be explained by the ability of RAF inhibitors to
paradoxically activate the MAPK pathway in cells that are WT
for BRAF but have strong upstream signaling (12–15). Therefore, it is possible that, in this model with a moderately

sensitive tumor target, the main beneﬁcial effects of vemurafenib are derived from the ability of this agent to directly
improve immune effector functions independent of the effects
against the BRAFV600E mutant tumor.
One of the potential mechanisms of combinatorial activity of
tumor-damaging agents and immunotherapy, leading to
increased TIL activation, is an increased antigen presentation
by the tumor cells themselves (8). However, in our studies we
could not readily detect an increase in tumor antigen or MHC
molecule expression by SM1 cells exposed to vemurafenib. An
alternative approach leading to increased antigen presentation
would be an increased tumor antigen cross-presentation by
host antigen-presenting cells picking up antigen released by
dying cancer cells. However, it is hard to develop direct
evidence of tumor antigen cross-presentation in these animal
models, which may be further explored. In addition, it is
possible that vemurafenib could alter the tumor microenviroment inhibiting the production of immune suppressive factors
by the melanoma cells, leading to increased adoptively transferred lymphocyte activation without increasing antigen crosspresentation. A slower tumor growth and blocking the oncogenic MAPK pathway signaling would favorably modulate the

tumor microenviroment allowing antitumor lymphocytes to
be better activated and produce IFN-g as we have detected.
It is possible that the mechanism of improved combinatorial
effects may be different in a BRAFV600 mutant tumor with
higher sensitivity to vemurafenib. In our models based on the
SM1 cell line, single-agent vemurafenib had a mainly antiproliferative effect in vivo, as opposed to the induction of
rapid tumor regression. SM1 is relatively resistant to singleagent vemurafenib in vitro and in vivo, possibly because of
the multiple genomic alterations in this cell line, including
deletion of CDKN2A and ampliﬁcation of BRAF and MITF. In
fact, ampliﬁcation of BRAFV600E is a bona ﬁde mechanism of
resistance to BRAF inhibitors in the clinical setting (37), and
possibly the main reason why SM1-established tumors in
mice do not regress with the treatment with vemurafenib. If
new murine melanoma cell lines driven by BRAFV600E are
developed in the future with higher in vitro and in vivo
sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors, it is possible that even more
synergistic effects of BRAF inhibitors with immunotherapy
may be detected. A rapid tumor response may be more likely
to induce tumor antigen-speciﬁc T-cell activation by antigen
cross-presentation, or inhibition of the immunosuppressive

enlist inﬂammatory cells producing chemokine attractants
for lymphocytes, resulting in increased intratumoral
inﬁltration.
In conclusion, combined therapy with the BRAFV600-speciﬁc
inhibitor vemurafenib and TCR-engineered ACT resulted in
superior antitumor effects against a fully syngeineic BRAFV600E
mutant melanoma. Although the absolute number of T cells
inﬁltrating the tumor was not increased by vemurafenib, the
combination increased the functionality of antigen-speciﬁc T
lymphocytes. Therefore, our studies support the clinical testing
of combinations of BRAF targeted therapy and immunotherapy for patients with advanced melanoma.
