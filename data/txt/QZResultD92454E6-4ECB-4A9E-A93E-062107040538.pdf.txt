Abstract
Macrophages are sentinel immune cells that survey the tissue microenvironment, releasing cytokines in
response to both exogenous insults and endogenous events such as tumorigenesis. Macrophages mediate tumor
surveillance and therapy-induced tumor regression; however, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and their
products may also promote tumor progression. Whereas NF-kB is prominent in macrophage-initiated inﬂammatory responses, little is known about the role of p53 in macrophage responses to environmental challenge,
including chemotherapy or in TAMs. Here, we report that NF-kB and p53, which generally have opposing effects in
cancer cells, coregulate induction of proinﬂammatory genes in primary human monocytes and macrophages.
Using Nutlin-3 as a tool, we demonstrate that p53 and NF-kB rapidly and highly induce interleukin (IL)-6 by
binding to its promoter. Transcriptome analysis revealed global p53/NF-kB co-regulation of immune response
genes, including several chemokines, which effectively induced human neutrophil migration. In addition, we show
that p53, activated by tumor cell paracrine factors, induces high basal levels of macrophage IL-6 in a TAM model
system [tumor-conditioned macrophages (TCM)]. Compared with normal macrophages, TCMs exhibited higher
p53 levels, enhanced p53 binding to the IL-6 promoter, and reduced IL-6 levels upon p53 inhibition. Taken
together, we describe a mechanism by which human macrophages integrate signals through p53 and NF-kB to
drive proinﬂammatory cytokine induction. Our results implicate a novel role for macrophage p53 in conditioning
the tumor microenvironment and suggest a potential mechanism by which p53-activating chemotherapeutics,
acting upon p53-sufﬁcient macrophages and precursor monocytes, may indirectly impact tumors lacking
functional p53. Cancer Res; 74(8); 2182–92. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The immune system is intricately connected to various
stages of tumorigenesis. On one hand, it is critical in the clearance of senescent and damaged tumor cells after therapy and
in tumor prevention through detection and elimination
of early-stage cancer cells (1, 2). Work from Xue and colleagues
(1) is exemplary of this phenomenon, because they show that
p53 stabilization triggers senescence in tumor cells in mice
and subsequent activation of innate immune cells that ultimately clear the senescent tumor cells, leading to tumor

regression. On the other hand, immune cells associated with
the tumor microenvironment of advanced cancers have tumorpromoting functions through secretion of soluble factors that
promote survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis
(3). Underlying central components to this dual function of
the immune system in tumorigenesis are macrophages.
Macrophages are key players in innate immunity, and
their functions depend on the environment in which they
reside. In a noncancerous microenvironment, macrophages
are central detectors of infectious and noninfectious exogenous stress, including DNA-damaging agents such as chemotherapeutics. Upon stimulation, macrophages trigger
cascades of cell–cell signaling that result in synthesis and
secretion of proinﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines,
and, consequently, recruitment of other effector immune
cells. In the context of a tumor, tumor cells secrete soluble
factors that recruit and program tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) to support tumor growth (3). TAMs are
phenotypically distinct from classical macrophages in that
they exhibit different morphology and expression markers.
For example, TAMs have high expression of interleukin
(IL)-6, CXCL1, IL-8, and CCL2 (3–5). The secretion of cytokines and chemokines constitute a major mechanistic feature of macrophage function; therefore, understanding the
precise mechanisms that drive the induction of proinﬂammatory genes is crucial.

p53 and NF-kB Gene Regulation in Human Macrophages

NF-kB plays an essential role in inﬂammation, innate
immunity, and cancer (6, 7). Activated by inﬂammatory stimuli
such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) and
various cytokines, including TNF-a, NF-kB enhances transcription of several proinﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-6
and IL-8, which are secreted from the cell and propagate the
immune response by acting on neighboring immune cells (6).
In addition, NF-kB is found constitutively activated in several
types of human cancers and has been shown to promote cancer
cell growth and survival, for example, by regulating the transcription of antiapoptotic genes (7).
Another master regulator of stress response, the tumor
suppressor p53, also has roles in inﬂammation and immunity
(8, 9). Recently, we reported that p53 can upregulate most
members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family and consequently enhance TLR-dependent production of proinﬂammatory cytokines (10, 11). Surprisingly, p53 regulation of the TLRs
is restricted to human cells because the p53 response elements
(p53REs) in the TLR promoter regions are not conserved in
mice (10), suggesting that some p53-related immune responses
can only be addressed in human material. These results
highlight the fact that p53 has an important physiologic role
in the immune system in addition to its well-characterized role
as a tumor suppressor, providing a new dimension to the broad
role that p53 plays in human biology.
Mechanistically, activation of p53 and NF-kB is similar
and involves stress-induced degradation of inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, Mdm2 (murine double-minute 2 or human hMdm2)
binds to p53 and targets p53 for proteasomal degradation.
During cellular stress, Mdm2 and p53 are modiﬁed and can
no longer bind to each other, leading to p53 stabilization
(12). For NF-kB, the subunits are held in the cytoplasm
through binding to IkB (inhibitor of NF-kB) proteins. Upon
stimulation, IkB is phosphorylated by the upstream IKK
(inhibitor of nuclear factor-kB kinase) complex, leading to
ubiquitination and degradation of IkB, which allows the NFkB subunits to enter the nucleus and modulate transcription
(reviewed in ref. 6). Although both transcription factors are
activated by similar stimuli, the resulting biologic consequences are generally considered to be opposing in that NFkB signaling is mostly associated with prosurvival cues and
p53 induction is proapoptotic (13). In addition, signaling
cross-talk between p53 and NF-kB is antagonistic (13).
However, there are a few examples of p53 and NF-kB
working together (14, 15).
Because macrophages are key players in the immune
response to tumor cells, we have addressed the potential
role for p53 regulation of immune genes and possible
interactions with the NF-kB network within human macrophages from healthy human subjects and in a TAM in vitro
model system, tumor conditioned macrophages (TCM).
We show that p53 and NF-kB coregulate the expression of
several proinﬂammatory genes, including cytokines (such as
IL-6) and chemokines (such as CXCL1) in TCMs and in
normal macrophages in response to p53 and NF-kB–activating agents. Taken together, these results identify a unique
p53/NF-kB interaction within macrophages that we propose
may be important in amplifying the immune responses

Results
Activation of p53 induces IL-6, TNFa, and IL-8 expression
In our initial experiments, we assessed the effect of p53
activation on gene expression in primary human alveolar
macrophages using the chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin
and 5-ﬂuorouracil and the small molecule Nutlin-3, which
stabilizes p53 (Supplementary Fig. S1A; ref. 19). Treatment
with doxorubicin highly induced mRNA levels of the cytokine
gene IL-6, a proinﬂammatory gene important for macrophage
function (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, Nutlin-3 treatment for 6
hours also enhanced mRNA levels of the cytokines IL-6 and
TNFa and the chemokine IL-8 in macrophages from every
donor tested; however, there were large differences among the
genes and donors. The expression of the p21 gene, a wellknown p53 target that identiﬁes p53 activation, was also
increased by Nutlin-3 treatment (Fig. 1B) but with less variation. Notably, IL-6 mRNA was induced in some donors to
much higher levels than TNFa or IL-8 (Fig. 1B). Because IL-6,
TNFa, and IL-8 protein were all induced (Fig. 1C and S1B), p53
activation is likely to have a strong functional impact.
Rapid induction of IL-6 by Nutlin-3
Because of low cell recovery and availability, experiments
with human alveolar macrophages are limiting. Therefore, we
utilized macrophages differentiated ex vivo from primary
human blood monocytes (monocyte-derived macrophages).
Similar to results with alveolar macrophages, induction of IL-6
after treatment with doxorubicin, 5-ﬂuorouracil, and Nutlin-3
was also observed in monocyte-derived macrophages (Fig. 2A).
All three treatments also induced p21, demonstrating p53
responsiveness (Fig. 2A). Because IL-6 induction was the high-

Figure 1. Doxorubicin (DOX) and Nutlin-3 treatment induces expression
of proinﬂammatory genes including IL-6. A, alveolar macrophages from
different donors were treated with doxorubicin (0.3 mmol/L) for 24 hours
and mRNA levels of IL-6 were measured with RT-PCR; values were
signiﬁcantly increased compared with untreated controls (P < 0.05). B,
mRNA levels of IL-6, TNFa, IL-8, and p21 of alveolar macrophages
treated with Nutlin-3 (10 mmol/L) for 6 hours were measured with
RT-PCR, and values were normalized to DMSO-treated controls. mRNA
levels of each gene for the group of donors were signiﬁcantly ( )
increased with Nutlin-3 treatment compared with DMSO (P < 0.05). C,
secreted IL-6 protein from alveolar macrophages treated with either
DMSO or Nutlin-3 for 6 hours was measured with an ELISA. Values from
each donor were plotted, and, when grouped, IL-6 mRNA levels
from Nutlin-3–treated samples were statistically increased compared
with DMSO (P < 0.05). Each donor is identiﬁed with an arbitrary number
indicated in the graphs.

est and most consistent cytokine product among donors after
Nutlin-3 treatment, our subsequent experiments focused on
Nutlin-3 activation of p53.
Because p53 nuclear accumulation is observed within 1 hour
of Nutlin-3 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1A), we assayed
the kinetics of IL-6 induction by Nutlin-3 in monocyte-derived
macrophages. IL-6 mRNA induction levels were measured
after 2, 4, and 6-hour Nutlin-3 treatments of macrophages
from each donor (Fig. 2B). Within 2 hours, the level of IL-6
mRNA was dramatically increased, up to 10,000-fold, in cells
of all but one donor (which showed an 8-fold induction).
The rapid and large increases are similar to cytokine production triggered through TLR signaling by PAMPs such as LPS
(20). In addition, IL-6 induction by Nutlin-3 treatment was
dependent on transcription since pretreatment with actinomycin D, a transcription inhibitor, abolished IL-6 mRNA
induction (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
The kinetics and level of IL-6 induction by Nutlin-3 varied
considerably among donors, suggesting large differences in

p53 and NF-kB Gene Regulation in Human Macrophages

whereas donors 123 and 125 were relatively lower responders
with induction levels reaching 10–100-fold (Fig. 2A and B).
There was much less variability in the kinetics of p21 induction compared with IL-6 induction by Nutlin-3 (Fig. 2A and
B), suggesting that the differences are not due to p53 level.
The very rapid and dramatic IL-6 induction by Nutlin-3 was
surprising because this deviates from the typical kinetics of p53dependent gene regulation described in the literature. Whereas
gene regulation by other transcription factors such as NF-kB
can be rapid (within minutes; ref. 21), p53 regulation of transcription generally occurs more slowly (over several hours;
ref. 22). In addition, the increases in protein levels for IL-6,
IL-8, and TNFa after Nutlin-3 treatment were comparable with
the levels induced by LPS treatment, a well-known stimulator of
the inﬂammatory response and activator of NF-kB (Supplementary Fig. S1B). To conﬁrm that the induction of IL-6 by
Nutlin-3 was p53-dependent, we examined the effects of the p53
inhibitor piﬁthrin-a (PFT-a; ref. 23). Several attempts to signiﬁcantly reduce p53 using siRNA approaches were unsuccessful due to low transfection efﬁciency of primary human macrophages. In addition, as reported by Liu and colleagues (24) and
from our preliminary experiments, Nutlin-3 treatment alone
did not induce IL-6 expression in bone marrow–derived macrophages from wild-type mice, preventing our use of p53/
murine macrophages in this study. As expected, PFT-a reduced
Nutlin-3–induced p21 levels in all donors (Supplementary Fig.
S1D). Because, as shown in Fig. 2C, the PFT-a pretreatment
dramatically lowered Nutlin-3–induced IL-6 mRNA levels, we
conclude that p53 is required for IL-6 induction by Nutlin-3 in
human macrophages.

Figure 2. p53 activation induces rapid and high IL-6 expression in
monocyte-derived macrophages. A, monocyte-derived macrophages were
treated with Nutlin-3 or doxorubicin (DOX) for 4 hours or with 5-ﬂuorouracil
for 6 hours, and IL-6 and p21 mRNA levels were measured with RT-PCR. B,
IL-6 and p21 mRNA levels of monocyte-derived macrophages were
measured with RT-PCR after treatment with Nutlin-3 for the indicated times.
For A and B, values were normalized to DMSO-treated controls for Nutlin-3
and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5FU) or untreated controls for doxorubicin. Each donor
in A and B is identiﬁed with an arbitrary number indicated in the A graph. C,
fold change in IL-6 mRNA levels was measured from monocyte-derived
macrophages (donor 96) and alveolar macrophages (donors 1190 and
1186) treated with Nutlin-3 for 6 hours with and without Pifthrin-a
pretreatment (4 hours; PFT-a). Values were normalized to DMSO or PFT-a
(alone)-treated controls. P < 0.05 for expression changes in all panels except
for the following: P ¼ 0.058 for IL-6 induction by 5-ﬂuorouracil (A); and
P ¼ 0.063 for p21 induction after a 2 hour Nutlin-3 treatment (B, 2 hours).
Statistical signiﬁcance ( ) is indicated for the group of donors relative to
control (P < 0.05). For C, IL-6 mRNA levels with Nutlin-3 plus PFT-a
treatment are signiﬁcantly lower than Nutlin-3 treatment alone (P < 0.05).

macrophages from donors 117 and 120 were high responders
with IL-6 induction levels in the 10,000–25,000-fold range,

Induction of IL-6 by p53-activating agents is limited to
the monocyte/macrophage cell lineage
Several other types of primary cells and cancer cell lines were
tested for the effect of p53-activating agents on IL-6 induction.
As shown in Supplementary Table S1, short (e.g., 2 hours) and
long (e.g., 24 hours) incubations with Nutlin-3, doxorubicin,
and 5-ﬂuorouracil did not induce IL-6 expression in cancer cell
lines of various origins and p53 status, such as breast (MCF-7,
p53þ), bone (Saos2, p53 and U2OS, p53þ), lung (H1299, p53),
and colon (HCT-116, p53þ). As expected, p21 was upregulated
in all cell lines carrying a functional TP53 gene. Other types of
human primary cells were also treated with Nutlin-3, doxorubicin, and 5-ﬂuorouracil, including human diploid ﬁbroblasts,
CD3þ T-lymphocytes, etc. (Supplementary Table S1). Whereas
all of these cells showed p53 responsiveness (i.e., p21 induction;
ref. 10), the only human primary cells that showed induction
of either IL-6, TNFa, or IL-8 after treatment with p53-activating
agents were CD14þ monocytes, which are macrophage precursors. Altogether, p53 regulation of IL-6 appears restricted to
human monocytes and macrophages.
Activation of NF-kB is required for Nutlin-3 induction of
IL-6 in primary macrophages
Having established that p53 is required for Nutlin-3 induction of IL-6, we next investigated whether NF-kB is also
required. First, NF-kB is a well-known regulator of the transcription of the proinﬂammatory genes IL-6, TNFa, and IL-8

Figure 3. Nutlin-3 triggers activation of the NF-kB subunit p65 and binding of p53 and p65 to the promoter of IL-6. A, immunoblot analysis was
performed to measure protein levels from Nutlin-3–treated and DMSO-treated (-) macrophages. Top, phosphorylated IkBa (p IkBa Ser32 and Ser36)
and total IkBa protein were measured in cytoplasmic extracts from monocyte-derived macrophages. Bottom, phosphorylated p65 (pp65, Ser276)
and total p65 protein were measured from whole-cell extracts from monocyte-derived macrophages. B, fold change in IL-6 mRNA levels from
macrophages treated with Nutlin-3 for 2 hours with and without pretreatment of Bay-11-7083 (Bay, 30 minutes). IL-6 mRNA levels with Nutlin-3 plus Bay-117082 for the group of donors were signiﬁcantly lower than Nutlin-3 treatment alone (P < 0.05). C, schematic of the location of the p53 half site and kB site in the
IL-6 promoter region relative to the TSS. D and E, p65 ChIP (D) or p53 ChIP (E) of monocyte-derived macrophages were treated with Nutlin-3 or DMSO for 1
hour. Primers that ampliﬁed the IL-6 promoter region were used in a PCR reaction with DNA collected from each ChIP. Values are plotted as % Input. Enriched
binding of p65 and p53 to the IL-6 promoter is signiﬁcantly greater ( , P < 0.05) than with IgG in all samples (i.e., with DMSO and Nutlin-3 treatment).

(25, 26). Second, the kinetics of IL-6 induction by Nutlin-3 are
comparable to those for cytokine induction by PAMPs, which
are largely driven by NF-kB (20). Third, there are reports
describing cooperation between p53 and NF-kB in the transcription of certain genes (15, 27). Finally, NF-kB and p53 are
known to be coordinately activated by certain stimuli, such as
DNA damage, oxidative stress, and immune stimuli (28).
We ﬁrst evaluated whether NF-kB is indeed activated by
Nutlin-3 in human macrophages. In the canonical NF-kB
pathway, the inhibitor IkBa is phosphorylated and degraded, which frees the NF-kB subunits to translocate to the
nucleus to promote transcription of target genes, including
the IkBa gene (6). We found that IkBa protein decreases
within 30 minutes of Nutlin-3 addition to monocyte-derived
macrophages, followed by an increase to almost basal levels
at 6 hours (Fig. 3A). Similar results were seen with alveolar
macrophages (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In addition, IkBa
phosphorylation on Ser32 is seen as early as 30 minutes after
Nutlin-3 treatment ("pIkBa," Fig. 3A).
In addition to regulation by the inhibitor IkB proteins, NFkB subunits are further regulated by posttranslational modiﬁcations such as phosphorylation. Serine 276, an important
activating phosphorylation site of the NF-kB subunit p65,
(29) is phosphorylated after a 2-hour treatment of Nutlin-3
(Fig. 3A, "pp65"). Cytokine induction by nutlin requires
phosphorylation of both IkBa and p65, as IL-6 induction is
markedly reduced by pretreatment either with Bay-11-7082
(Fig. 3B), a small molecule that inhibits IkBa phosphorylation and p65 nuclear translocation (30), or with a p65 decoy

2186

Cancer Res; 74(8) April 15, 2014

peptide that speciﬁcally competes with and blocks phosphorylation of S276 on the endogenous p65 protein (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Thus, Nutlin-3 represents a useful tool
to probe the effect of dual p53 and NF-kB activation on gene
regulation in macrophages.
Nutlin-3 treatment induces p53 and p65 binding to the
promoter region of IL-6
In silico analysis of the IL-6 gene promoter region revealed a
potential p53 response element (p53RE) consisting of a decamer half-site located 362 base pairs (362 bp) upstream from
the TSS in addition to a previously reported kB site (138 bp;
Fig. 3C; ref. 31). Because we previously established p53 responsiveness at half-sites (32), we performed ChIP assays to determine whether p53 and NF-kB could cooperate in cis to mediate
IL-6 expression. As depicted in Fig. 3D and E, both p53 and p65
bound to the promoter of the IL-6 gene after 1 hour of Nutlin-3
treatment of monocyte-derived macrophages. However, when
compared with p65, occupancy of p53 was lower; the levels of
DNA pulled down by the p65 ChIP were 0.7%–1.25% of the
input as compared with 0.3% to 0.5% of the input for p53 ChIP.
One possible explanation for weaker p53 binding is that the
p53RE is a half-site, which generally shows less binding than
full sites (32). As expected, p53 and p65 also bind to the p21
promoter (Supplementary Fig. S2C), as previously shown in
other cell systems (33, 34). Taken together, these data show
that both p65 and p53 bind to regions near the IL-6 gene,
suggesting that they work together in cis to regulate IL-6 gene

mRNA (fold change)

Chemokines are highly induced by both Nutlin-3 and LPS
We hypothesized that if p53 and NF-kB coregulate IL-6 gene
transcription in human macrophages, there is likely a larger set
of genes that are also subject to the coregulation. To investigate
this possibility, we performed microarray analyses with monocyte-derived macrophages from two different donors treated
with either LPS or Nutlin-3 for 2 hours. We reasoned that
because LPS is a well-known activator of NF-kB, genes regulated by both LPS and Nutlin-3 might have responses similar to
that of IL-6. We chose to use macrophages from donors with
similar demographics (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Principal component analysis showed that the microarrays
were of good quality and that even with similar demographics
the donors grouped separately for all treatments (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Nonetheless, gene regulation in response to 2hour treatments with either Nutlin-3 or LPS was remarkably
similar in both donors as shown in the heat map in Supplementary Fig. S3C. Although most studies have addressed p53
networks with Nutlin-3 at later times (35), we also ﬁnd elements of p53 signature (such as induction of p21 and Mdm2)
at the much shorter time of 2 hours in macrophages. Because
our goal was to identify genes regulated like IL-6, we chose to
focus only on the upregulated genes with a threshold 1.7-fold
change (Nutlin-3/DMSO or LPS/Untreated). Strikingly, most
of the genes upregulated by Nutlin-3 (155/175) were also upregulated by LPS (Fig. 4A). Thus, by using Nutlin-3 as an agent
to activate p53 and LPS to identify NF-kB–driven changes in
gene expression, we identify a subset of 155 genes that are
candidates for cooperative regulation by p53 and NF-kB.
Gene ontology analysis of the gene subset upregulated by
both Nutlin-3 and LPS revealed that approximately 40% of these
upregulated genes could be classiﬁed as functioning in the
immune response where immune and inﬂammatory response
functions were the most signiﬁcant (with the lowest P values) as
determined by the g:proﬁler program (Supplementary Table S2;
ref. 36). Importantly, if genes within this subset are indeed
regulated in a similar manner as IL-6, then there should be
response elements for NF-kB and p53 near these genes. In a
search for conserved transcription factor binding sites 1 kB
upstream of the TSS for each gene we found several that would
be capable of binding NF-kB subunits (Supplementary Table
S3). The motif with the most signiﬁcant P value was the p65
motif (P value of 1.58e7; Supplementary Table S3). Because
conventional prediction programs are poor identiﬁers of
p53REs, we used the p53 Scan software to search for predicted
p53REs and found that a large subset of the 155 genes had
associated p53REs (40/155 genes), and 25/155 genes had both
associated p53RE and kB sites (Supplementary Table S4).
Further classiﬁcation of the 155 gene subset based on the
level of fold change revealed that several of the genes were
highly upregulated (more than 10-fold) similar to IL-6 (Fig. 4B).
As expected, IL-6, IL-8, and TNFa were highly induced by both
Nutlin-3 and LPS (Supplementary Table S5). In addition,
chemokines including CXCL1, CCL20, IL-8, CCL4, and CXCL3
were among the highest induced genes after Nutlin-3 treatment (Supplementary Table S5, the  refers to chemokines).
Induction of these chemokines was validated with real-time
(RT)-PCR (Fig. 4C and D), and several of these chemokines have

potential p53REs, some of which are listed in Supplementary
Table S6. Some genes, like CXCL3, have multiple p53REs. In
addition, CCL5 and CCL3 had perfect (i.e., no mismatches) halfsite p53REs (bold letters; Supplementary Table S5). p53 and
NF-kB are both required for Nutlin-3 induction of these
chemokines, because inhibition of p53 or NF-kB by pretreatment with PFT-a or Bay-11-7082, respectively, signiﬁcantly
reduced Nutlin-3–induced CXCL3, CCL3, and CCL4 levels (Supplementary Fig. S3D). Together, our data suggest that these
chemokines are regulated similarly to IL-6 in primary human
macrophages.

Nutlin-3 treatment of macrophages enhances chemokine
secretion and induces neutrophil migration
Having established that activation of p65 and p53 in primary
human macrophages enhances the expression of speciﬁc
cytokines and chemokines, we investigated the biologic consequences. Because chemokines such as CXCL1, IL-8, and
CXCL3 secreted from macrophages can bind to receptors on
the surface of neutrophils to promote migration (37), we tested
whether Nutlin-3 treatment increased chemokines in the culture supernatant and enhanced neutrophil migration. As
shown in Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S1B, treatment
of macrophages with Nutlin-3 and LPS (used as a positive
control) for 24 hours induced robust CXCL1 and IL-8 secretion.
To determine whether these secreted chemokines are functional, a migration assay was performed to test whether the
chemokine-rich culture supernatant resulting from Nutlin-3

treatment was capable of promoting neutrophil migration.
Migration of primary human neutrophils toward supernatants
from macrophages treated for 24 hours with Nutlin-3 or LPS
was signiﬁcantly higher than the untreated and DMSO control
supernatants (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data show coregulation of cytokine and chemokine expression by p53 and
NF-kB in primary human macrophages. While the role of NFkB in this process is well described, our data highlight a novel
role of p53 in macrophage function.
p53 is activated and drives IL-6 expression in tumorconditioned macrophages
Having identiﬁed a subset of chemokines and cytokines
regulated by p53 in normal macrophages we next assessed
whether p53 plays a similar role in gene regulation in TAMs. To
address this issue, we used an established in vitro model system
of TAMs in which human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC)
or isolated monocytes are differentiated into macrophages by
culturing them with conditioned media from cultured cancer
cells lines or primary tumor cells, resulting in TCMs (4, 5).
Conﬁrming successful induction of TCMs, macrophages cultured under these conditions exhibited a distinct, elongated
morphology compared with normal macrophages cultured
under standard conditions (MAC) and showed upregulation
of several TAM/TCM markers such as IL-6, IL-8, CXCL-1, and
CCL2 (Fig. 6A and B; ref. 38). Interestingly, most of these TAM/
TCM markers, including IL-6, are genes we had identiﬁed as
coregulated by p53 and NF-kB and have also been shown to
contribute to tumorigenesis (4, 5, 39). However, while NF-kB
activity has been shown to regulate the expression of these
genes in TAMs/TCMs (3), the role of p53 in this process is
unknown. We ﬁrst tested whether p53 was activated in TCMs
and whether it contributes to their high basal expression levels
of IL-6. As shown in Fig. 6C, p53 protein levels are indeed higher
in TCMs compared with normal MACs. Furthermore, four
classical p53 targets, p21, Mdm2, Puma, and Bax, were consistently increased between 2- and 10-fold in TCMs compared
with MACs depending on the gene and donor, suggesting that
the stabilized p53 is functional. Interestingly, whereas p53
activation generally occurs through stabilization of p53 protein, the TCMs showed increased p53 mRNA compared with
MACs, which could contribute to the larger level of p53
proteins (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Furthermore, p53 binding to the IL-6 promoter region was increased in TCMs, and
treatment with PFT-a for 4 hours reduced IL-6 levels in
TCMs (Fig. 6E and F). Interestingly, additional p53 stabilization by treatment with Nutlin-3 did not induce IL-6 in TCMs,
which might be due to high IL-6 basal levels (Supplementary
Fig. S4B). Taken together, these data indicate that p53, activated by paracrine factors released by tumor cells, promotes
IL-6 expression in TCMs.

Discussion
We have identiﬁed a novel role for p53 that is speciﬁc to the
regulation of several proinﬂammatory genes in human macrophages, including IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL1. Importantly, NF-kB
coactivation is essential for this regulation. While previous
investigations have suggested the potential for p53/NF-kB

interactions (15), our study is the ﬁrst to investigate such
interactions in human primary immune cells. Importantly, the
only cells in which we were able to detect p53/NF-kB coregulation of cytokines were macrophages and precursor
monocytes. Presented in Fig. 7 is a model summarizing our
ﬁnding on potential p53 and NF-kB responses in normal
macrophages and TAMs. In macrophages associated with
normal tissue, enhanced cytokine/chemokine induction due
to activated p53 and NF-kB may lead to neutrophil recruitment
and inﬂammation. Given that p53 and NF-kB are activated by
many exogenous stimuli, this coregulatory transcriptional
mechanism might serve as an important amplifying element
in the macrophage's response to a wide array of tissue-damaging insults. In the tumor microenvironment, macrophage
p53 appears to be activated in response to paracrine tumor
signals and, in part, facilitates IL-6 expression. In this context,
the tumor-derived growth factors may induce a p53 response
in the macrophages, which in turn alters cellular behavior of
the tumor cells. This p53 response could possibly have some
beneﬁcial consequences in tumors, which are often p53 defective. On one hand, p53 may function to promote senescence,
especially because p53 and NF-kB have been shown to cooperate in senescence and NF-kB is important in cytokine/
chemokine gene regulation in TAMs (3, 40). On the other hand,
the protumor effects of IL-6 and chemokines, including CXCL1,
on tumor cell survival, angiogenesis, and recruitment of protumor tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN) have been well

Figure 7. Schematic of p53 and NF-kB signaling and interaction in human
macrophages. p53 and NF-kB are activated in macrophages after
challenge with stressors (like DNA-damaging agents and Nutlin-3) in
macrophages in the normal microenvironment and in macrophages
associated with the tumor microenvironment. In both types of
macrophages, p53 and NF-kB activation results in induction of
proinﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines by binding of both factors to
promoter regions of these genes. Biologic outcomes as a result of
p53/NF-kB co-regulation of these genes like IL-6 and IL-8 are likely
distinct depending on the microenvironment. In a normal
microenvironment, IL-6 and CXCL1 results in inﬂammation and
neutrophil recruitment, whereas these proteins may have protumor roles
in a tumor microenvironment such as enhancing tumor cell survival and
tumor-associated neutrophil (TAN) recruitment.

described (3). Thus, p53 within TAMs might contribute to
tumor promotion through supporting a paracrine axis of
secreted cytokines and chemokines (including IL-6 and
CXCL1) between TAMs and tumor cells. The impact of activated p53 on cytokine/chemokines in TAMs along with the
tumorigenic consequences as described in our model will be of
interest in future studies.
Given the rapid kinetics of proinﬂammatory gene induction
and the high levels of IL-6 induction, our ﬁndings may also be
more broadly relevant to tissue responses induced during p53activating cancer therapies. For example, circulating IL-6 is
detected early after radiotherapy and can be used as a predictive diagnostic test for radiation pneumonitis (41, 42). Here,
we found that the level of IL-6 induction by p53 and NF-kB
activation was among the highest of all cytokines and occurred
within 2 hours in macrophages from all donors. Our ﬁnding
that the magnitude of IL-6 induction is donor-dependent
implies that there may be underlying genetic determinants of
IL-6 activation by p53 and NF-kB. For example, there may be
polymorphisms in one or both of these transcription factors
or their response elements. Our ﬁnding that the induction
of IL-6 was dramatically more variable than that of the classical p53 target gene p21 may suggest that polymorphic p53
response elements in the IL-6 promoter are likely. We propose
that such genetic variants, if identiﬁed, could perhaps be used
as predictors of the inﬂammatory response to chemotherapy
or radiotherapy.
This is the ﬁrst report, to our knowledge, showing that
Nutlin-3 activates NF-kB. While the mechanism of Nutlin-3
activation needs to be further deﬁned, it may be through the
DNA damage response (DDR). Dey and colleagues (43) have
reported that Nutlin-3 can inhibit rather than enhance NF-kB
function via a p53-dependent mechanism; however, that was
found in lung cancer cells. Nutlin-3 activation of NF-kB is likely
cell type-dependent and may depend on whether Nutlin-3
initiates the DDR, which also appears to be determined by
cell type and Nutlin-3 dose (44–47). Furthermore, Nutlin-3 and
a similar small molecule, RITA, which has also been shown to
induce the DDR (48), are currently being evaluated for cancer
therapy and may promote macrophage-mediated inﬂammatory responses that could serve as adjuvants in anticancer
responses.
An intriguing ﬁnding in our study is that p53 and NF-kB
work together to regulate gene expression, contrary to most
previous studies. There have been a few reports of small
degrees of p53 and NF-kB cooperativity (14, 15) unlike that
seen here, and the nature of the p53/NF-kB is likely contextdependent (27). Most of the research describing the opposing
interaction between p53 and NF-kB has been conducted in
either human cancer cells or mouse primary cells. Few reports
have addressed p53/NF-kB interactions in primary human
cells, especially in relation to macrophage function during
chemotherapy. Our ﬁnding that proinﬂammatory gene induction by Nutlin-3 is limited to primary human macrophages and
monocytes highlights the fact that interactions between p53
and NF-kB are different depending on context, for example,
cancer cells versus noncancerous "normal" cells and lymphocytes versus macrophages. The dramatic and speciﬁc respon-

2190

siveness of macrophages identiﬁes programmatic differences
from other cells, possibly to assure ROS-enhanced immune
responses. Because tissue macrophages are also relatively
resistant to genotoxic injury (49), our results suggest that
tissue macrophages may serve a dual function as sensors and
as effectors of an ampliﬁed response to genotoxic injury.
Expression of p53 in response to DNA damage could potentiate
NF-kB–induced inﬂammatory response and immune cell
recruitment. The underlying mechanisms for assuring these
programmatic differences between macrophages and other
cell types as well as the absence in rodents are intriguing issues
that have larger regulatory as well as evolutionary implications.
Another unexpected ﬁnding is that p53 is stabilized in TAMlike macrophages and enhances IL-6 expression. While the
roles of wild-type and mutant p53 are well described in
tumorigenesis, there have been no studies to our knowledge
addressing p53 functions in tumor-associated cells like TAMs.
p53 is commonly mutated in tumor cells; however, TAMs
presumably have wild-type p53 because they originate from
circulating monocytes that are recruited into the tumor microenvironment by soluble factors (3). This suggests that the role
of p53 in TAMs is likely different from its role within tumor
cells. Here, we show that p53 is activated in the absence of
exogenous stress in TAM-like cells, but the mechanism of this
activation is currently unknown. Because NF-kB is activated in
TAMs and can bind to kB sites in the TP53 gene to regulate p53
transcription (3, 50), one possibility is that NF-kB enhances p53
transcription in TAMs. It is also possible that signaling within
the macrophage by tumor cell-secreted soluble factors like MCSF and CCL2 (4) activates p53 independently of NF-kB.
Furthermore, the role of p53-driven proinﬂammatory gene
expression in TAMs is unclear. As mentioned above, p53 within
TAMs could conceivably have protumor functions. However, it
is also possible that macrophage p53 could promote senescence in TAMs, as secretion of cytokines and chemokines is
associated with senescence (senescence associated secretory
phenotype) and there is continuous turnover of TAMs in the
tumor microenvironment (3). Thus, the mechanism of p53
activation in TAMs, the functional role of p53 in TAMs, as
well the role of TAM p53 in tumorigenesis warrant further
investigation.
In summary, our results show that p53 and NF-kB together
drive expression of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6
and CXCL1, in macrophages. The secretion of these factors
may have distinct biologic effects depending on the microenvironment, promoting inﬂammation in normal tissues upon
injury and modifying cancer cell responses in the tumor
microenvironment. Importantly, we found that Nutlin-3 had
no apparent effect on the expression of IL-6 in TAM-like
cells, possibly because p53 is already present. This may suggest
that systemic treatment with p53-activating chemotherapeutics might enhance antitumor responses of normal macrophages without augmenting protumor functions of TAMs. The
net effect of TAM p53 upon tumorigenesis remains to be
deﬁned. Nonetheless, our studies suggest that therapies based
on p53 activation may impact tumor cell biology through
p53-positive macrophages even in patients with tumors lacking functional p53.
