ABSTRACT
Hypomethylating treatment (HMT) has been suggested as a feasible bridge
to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), but controversies exist around
influences of HMT response on transplant outcomes. To assess the safety and
influences of pre-transplant HMT focusing on debulking effects and transplant
outcomes, we retrospectively analyzed consecutive HSCT-eligible patients who
received HMT for higher-risk MDS with excess blasts. Of all 98 patients, 11 patients
failed to proceed to HSCT and HMT-related mortality occurred in 8 patients. When
excluding 9 patients who refused HSCT, 87% of scheduled HSCT (77 of 89) was
performed after a median of 3 cycles (range, 1-8) of HMT. The 4-year overall survival
after HMT (n = 98) and HSCT (n = 77) was 44.0% and 53.6%, respectively. Transplant
outcomes were significantly different by the final response at HSCT; marrow response
group (complete remission, marrow complete remission with or without hematologic
improvement) showed significantly better 4-year disease-free survival compared
to no marrow response group (n = 36, 87.3% vs. n = 41, 10.7%, P < 0.001). This
difference between the groups was also evident in overall survival (90.9% vs. 8.6%,
P < 0.001) and cumulative incidences of relapse (6.5% vs. 45.4%, P < 0.001) and
treatment-related mortality (6.2% vs. 43.9%, P < 0.001). These observations indicate
that pre-transplant HMT is a feasible bridging treatment in patients with excess blasts
regarding high success rate of proceeding to transplantation and good survival rate.
Marrow response at HSCT regardless of concomitant hematological improvement is
an independent predictor of better survival, suggesting that immediate HSCT rather
than continuing HMT should be performed once marrow response is achieved.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation
(HSCT) remains the only curative strategy to treat patients
with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and the role
of bridging therapy using intensive chemotherapy or
hypomethylating agents followed by HSCT in higherrisk MDS has been suggested [1]. Advances in the uses
of alternative donors and reduced intensity conditioning
regimens have extended the use of allogeneic HSCT to
a wider number of patients, while high-resolution HLA
typing and better supportive care facilitated minimizing
treatment-related toxicities in older and less fit patients [2,
3].
However, the efficacy of HSCT in higher-risk
MDS remains unsatisfactory, compared to that in lowerrisk MDS, due to the high rates of relapse (30-40%) and
treatment-related mortality (TRM; 30-50%), leading
to worse long-term disease-free survival (DFS; < 30%
for higher-risk MDS) [4-6]. To achieve successful
pre-transplant disease control, as well as reduce posttransplant relapse, pre-transplant intensive chemotherapy
has been tried for patients with higher-risk MDS with
excess blasts who are particularly at risk of brisk disease
progression (DP) and transformation to acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) [6, 7].
Feasibility of pre-transplant hypomethylating
treatment (HMT) has been suggested in several previous
reports [8-11]. HMT is currently a standard therapy for
aged or debilitated patients with higher-risk MDS by its
favorable toxicity profile [1, 12] and substantial response
rate even in patients with poor cytogenetics [13-14]. In
our previous report, the positive effect of HMT response
on post-transplant survival was mostly due to marrow
response in patients with higher-risk MDS [11], suggesting
that the influences of HMT response might be associated
with debulking effects of HMT. Currently, there has been
little research on the use of HMT for “debulking strategy”
focusing on higher-risk MDS with excess marrow blasts
at HMT; thus, the issue as to whether HMT could be
an alternative to induction chemotherapy in the setting
remains to be clarified.
Given the above, this retrospective study was
designed to assess the role of pre-HSCT HMT by
analyzing treatment toxicities, rates of proceeding to
HSCT, and influences of response type (especially marrow
response) on transplant outcomes. To minimize selection
bias, we included all consecutive HSCT-eligible patients
who received HMT for higher-risk MDS with excess
blasts.

Baseline characteristics at pre-transplant HMT
Ninety-eight patients (61 men and 37 women) with
higher-risk MDS [15] and excess marrow blasts eligible
for HSCT had received azacitidine (n = 66) or decitabine
(n = 32). HMT was initiated from a median of 20 days
(range, 1-180 days) after the diagnosis of higher-risk
MDS. The median age of patients was 53 years (range,
18-65 years). The cytogenetic risk was good in 44 cases
(45%), intermediate in 29 cases (30%) and poor in 25
cases (25%), and the median percentage of bone marrow
blast at HMT was 13 (range, 6-19).

Response and disease course after pre-transplant
HMT
Of all 98 study patients, 59 patients (60%) showed a
treatment response after a median of 2 cycles (range, 1-9
cycles) of HMT, and their best responses were complete
remission (CR, n = 12), marrow CR with hematologic
improvement (mCR+HI, n = 12), mCR without HI
(mCR-HI, n = 26), and stable disease with HI (SD+HI,
n = 9; Figure 1A). Eleven (11%) patients became HSCTineligible (HSCT failure), and HMT-related mortality
occurred in 8 of 98 patients (8.2%). Nine (9%) patients
refused HSCT, while 1 patient was in its preparation
at our data cut-off point. When excluding 9 patients
who refused HSCT, 87% of scheduled HSCT (77 of 89
patients) was performed after a median of 3 cycles (range,
1-8) of HMT. Responses at the time of HSCT revealed
that 44 patients (57%) continuously maintained their
best responses to HMT (continued response), 27 patients
(35%) never responded to HMT (primary failure; SDHI, n = 17; primary DP, n = 10), and 6 patients (8%) lost
their best responses (secondary failure; relapse from CR,
n = 1; relapse from mCR-HI, n = 5). AML-like induction
chemotherapy was administered in 9 of the 11 patients
with AML transformation (primary DP to AML, n = 10;
relapse in AML from mCR-HI, n = 1). Further details are
illustrated in Figure 1A.
The median overall survival (OS) for all patients
from the initiation of HMT was 39.3 months (95%
confidence interval [CI]: 23.9-54.6 months; Figure 1B),
whereas the OS for the patients who received a transplant
did not reach the median (Figure 1C). The median OS
for patients in HSCT failure and those in HSCT refusal
were 4.3 months (95% CI: 0.6-8.1 months; Figure 1D)
and 15.8 months (95% CI: 12.4-19.1 months; Figure 1E),
respectively.

(n = 4), and infection (n = 7). The 4-year probabilities of
DFS and OS after HSCT were 53.6% ± 6.5% and 53.8%
± 6.6%, respectively, and the 4-year cumulative incidence
of relapse (CIR) and TRM (CITRM) were 23.9% ± 5.4%
and 22.5% ± 5.4%, respectively.

Seventy-five of the 77 transplant patients (97.4%)
achieved primary engraftment, with median times to
neutrophil and platelet engraftment of 12 days (range:
10-23 days) and 16 days (range: 9-51 days), respectively,
while 2 patients died before neutrophil recovery could
occur 22 and 24 days after graft infusion. The cumulative
incidence of 100-day grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host
disease (GVHD) was 29.9% ± 5.3%, and that of 2-year
chronic GVHD among the evaluable patients (n = 73)
was 48.1% ± 5.9%. After a median follow-up of 41.2
months (95% CI: 25.3-57.6 months) among the survivors,
47 patients are currently alive in remission (n = 46) or in
relapse (n = 1), and 30 patients have died due to relapse
(n = 15) or TRM (n = 15). The causes of TRM were

response and HMT-related mortality in entire cohort (n
= 98) are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The
presence of peripheral blood (PB) blasts was associated
with unfavorable marrow response compared to patients
without PB blasts (odds ratio: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.12-0.93,
P = 0.04). None of the variables was independently
associated with HMT-related mortality, although poor
cytogenetic risk was a potential prognostic factor. These
unfavorable impacts of PB blasts were further translated
into differences in 4-year OS in entire cohort (20.5%
± 11.0% vs. 52.0% ± 6.9%, P = 0.002; Supplementary
Figure 2A) as well as in transplant recipients (22.0% ±
12.6% vs. 61.7% ± 7.1%, P < 0.001; Supplementary
Figure 2B).

“marrow response” (n = 36) and “no marrow response”
(n = 41). The baseline characteristics of these two groups
are compared in Table 1. The two groups demonstrated
significant differences in the 4-year probabilities of DFS
(P < 0.001; Figure 3A), OS (P < 0.001; Figure 3B), CIR
(P < 0.001; Figure 3C), and CITRM (P = 0.001; Figure
3D). When similar analyses were performed according
to marrow blast count at HMT, significantly better DFS
rates were observed among patients with blast levels of
>5% and < 10% (marrow response: 88.9% ± 10.5% vs.
no marrow response: 37.5% ± 17.1%, P = 0.003; Figure
4A) and patients with blast levels of ≥10% (91.7% ± 5.6%
vs. 9.5% ± 8.1%, P < 0.001; Figure 4B). Table 2 lists the
influence of variables on transplant outcomes in univariate
analysis. In multivariate analysis (Table 3), no marrow
response at HSCT was a significant predictor for inferior
OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 12.6, P < 0.001), DFS (HR: 10.2,
P < 0.001), CIR (HR: 8.5, P = 0.004), and CITRM (HR:
8.6, P = 0.002). In addition, poor cytogenetic risk [15]
at HSCT was a significant predictor of inferior OS (HR:
2.9, P = 0.018), DFS (HR: 3.7, P = 0.003), and CIR (HR:
5.0, P = 0.002). Based on these results, we evaluated the
combined value of cytogenetic risk and continued marrow
response for predicting HSCT outcomes, illustrated in
Supplementary Figure 1A-1D.

DISCUSSION
Advanced disease status at HSCT has a clear
negative effect on the post-transplantation relapse rate,
which is particularly evident among patients with higherrisk MDS [16, 17]. Although AML-type induction
chemotherapy to reduce disease burden before transplant
could be used aiming at reducing relapse rates [18], the
role of pre-HSCT intensive therapy remains controversial
[19, 20], as the improved relapse rates may be offset by
significant toxicities. Furthermore, the related analyses
supporting pre-HSCT induction chemotherapy are
subject to an inherent selection bias, being related to
the considerable proportion of patients with induction
chemotherapy rendered ineligible for HSCT [21].
Therefore, the selection of pre-transplant bridging regimen
should be essentially focused on preventing disease

progression and toxicity that would interfere in proceeding
to HSCT, while inducing disease “debulking” (ideally
within a few months) translating into improved transplant
survival.
Although HMT is reported to have low toxicity,
there are no reports regarding its toxicity during
preparation for transplantation and the subsequent HSCT
success rate. Therefore, to provide clinically relevant
information, and to minimize selection bias, we screened
all patients who received HMT for higher-risk MDS
with excess blasts, and only excluded patients who were
ineligible for HSCT. Our analyses revealed that bridging
failure occurred in 11% of the patients with pre-HSCT
HMT, and that 8% experienced HMT-related mortality.
These results compare favorably with the higher mortality
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

rate of 16% during the induction chemotherapy among
carefully screened patients who were to undergo HSCT in
a prospective clinical trial [22]. The relatively low HMTrelated mortality rate in our study suggested that HMT is
a feasible pre-transplant option.
Disease stage at the time of transplantation has been
known as one of the most important factors that influence
outcome after allogeneic HSCT [17, 18, 23]. However,
a recent study by Potter et al. using a large registry data
suggested that, unlike for patients with primary refractory
disease, the post-transplant outcomes of patients with
MDS not in CR were not significantly worse than those
in CR [24]. This is in line with our results which showed
that continued marrow response even without HI at HSCT
was an independent predictor of a favorable prognosis,

and that CR was not a prerequisite for prolonged survival.
Furthermore, the acquisition of HI only without marrow
response did not translate into a survival benefit in our
transplantation setting. This finding is interesting, because
it conflicts with the survival benefit from the achievement
of HI in the HMT-only setting [25]. Similarly, in our
previous report, the positive effect of marrow response
with or without HI after HMT on post-transplant DFS
was mainly evident in patients classified as higher-risk
MDS before HMT while achievement of HI was the
main response type in lower-risk MDS [11], suggesting
that the influences of HMT response at HSCT vary
according to pre-HMT risk groups. The controversies
regarding the relationship between HMT response and
post-transplantation survival may be explained by the
heterogeneity in the time of response assessment, whether
or not HI is included for definition of overall response,
and different response patterns according to pre-HMT
risk groups [9, 11, 26]. Future studies are needed to
determine the role of pre-transplant achievement of HI by
HMT in comparison with upfront HSCT, as worsening of
cytopenias from pre-HSCT HMT aimed to achieve HI in
patients with low blast counts may increase their risk of
infectious complications [27].
The present study revealed that 50 of the 98 cases
experienced marrow response after a median of 2 cycles
(range: 1-9 cycles), and that the cumulative marrow
response rates after 2 cycles, 3 cycles, and 4 cycles were
68%, 84%, and 96%, respectively. The relatively high
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

marrow response rate in our study may be associated
with the frequent marrow assessments. Moreover, the
frequent response evaluation was helpful for immediately
identifying patients who had achieved a short-term
marrow response followed by a rapid increments in
marrow blasts. In fact, secondary failure typically
occurred at approximately 1 month after achieving marrow
response, and 5 of the 6 patients with secondary failure
died due to relapse (n = 3) or TRM (n = 2). These findings
suggest that it is important to maintain continued marrow
response until HSCT. According to the interim results
of a recent prospective Italian multicenter trial which
was designed to complete at least 4 cycles of pre-HSCT
azacitidine treatment before transplant, approximately
48% of the enrolled patients could not proceed to HSCT
due to reasons including disease relapse/ progression
(35%) or adverse events (27%)[28]. Thus, unlike in nontransplantation setting [25, 29], once marrow response has
been achieved, immediate HSCT seems most effective to
increase the likelihood of cases with higher-risk MDS
and excess blasts reaching transplantation with favorable
post-transplant outcomes, rather than to continue on HMT
beyond time of marrow response. Moreover, response
to HMT may reflect the innate sensitivity of the MDS
clone, and HMT-induced drug resistance or selection of
a resistant clone should be considered, as it may become
more likely after continued treatment [30]. The influence
of mCR upon survival was recently suggested in a study
of decitabine treatment [31], although our results may
12349

provide the first evidence regarding the importance of
marrow response in enhancing HSCT outcomes for
higher-risk MDS with excess blasts.
Our strategy of pre-transplant “debulking” treatment
with hypomethylating agent that was immediately
followed by HSCT seems to provide favorable posttransplant outcomes. The median survival duration was
39.3 months after HMT among all patients in this study,
which is superior to the reported 18-25 months after
azacitidine or 5-day decitabine treatment [21, 32-34],
showing the well-known effect of HSCT in higher-risk
MDS [35]. And also, the beneficial role of HSCT might
have been enhanced by pre-HSCT HMT, as our 4-year
DFS rate after HSCT (54%) was superior to those from
previous studies (15-30%) [4]. Furthermore, although we
only evaluated patients with higher-risk MDS and excess
blasts (>5%), the survival rate was comparable to that
observed in recent HSCT analyses encompassing both
lower- and higher-risk MDS [8, 10, 36], suggesting that
HMT pre-treatment before HSCT is feasible. We also
assume that, for those patients with lack of a matched
related or unrelated donor, our approach of immediately
proceeding to haploidentical-related transplant may have
contributed to the favorable outcomes in our study [3, 37].
Previous studies have reported that HMT response
could be predicted by several clinical parameters, such
as white blood cell count, platelet count, karyotype, and
marrow blast count [13, 38, 39]. In agreement with a recent
study conducted on a large registry data [40], the presence
of PB blasts was the only independent predictor of poor
marrow response, which was associated with inferior
survival in our study. Thus, while pre-HSCT HMT could
be preferred in patients without PB blasts, up-front HSCT
or pre-HSCT intensive chemotherapy could be considered
for patients with PB blasts. In addition to marrow response
at HSCT, poor karyotype was also a risk factor for relapse
and poor survival. Thus, marrow response, PB blast
detection, and karyotyping may be useful for selecting
pre-HSCT treatment option and patients who are most
appropriate for HSCT. Mutations in certain genes may
be useful for prediction of posttransplantation survival,
particularly in patients with complex karyotypes (e.g., by
assessing TP53) [41, 42], although these markers require
further studies for prediction of HMT response [39, 4345]. Future clinical trial might be useful for developing
and evaluating a stepwise decision-making model that is
based on these risk factors.
In conclusion, the findings of our study indicate that
the sequential treatment using HMT followed immediately
by HSCT is feasible and offers an efficient treatment
strategy for higher-risk MDS patients with excess
blasts. Notably, the achievement of marrow response
by pre-HSCT HMT and proceeding to transplant while
maintaining the response was significantly associated
with lower incidences of relapse and TRM and improved
DFS. These results suggest that, once marrow response
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is achieved during HMT, immediate HSCT rather than
continuing HMT should be considered for patients with
higher-risk MDS and excess blasts. The development of
clinical and molecular tools for earlier recognition of HMT
response may also optimize selecting transplant candidates
and timing. Whether pre-HSCT HMT offers advantages
over upfront HSCT and intensive chemotherapy in higherrisk patient, especially those with excess blasts, needs to
be confirmed by randomized trials.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient selection
All adult patients with MDS who were eligible for
HSCT were retrospectively screened to identify cases
with higher-risk MDS and excess marrow blasts that
received pre-HSCT HMT between January 2009 and June
2015 at the Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation
Center (Seoul, Korea). We analyzed the patients receiving
HMT for MDS with marrow blast levels of >5% and
intermediate-2 or high-risk group according to the
International Prognostic Scoring System [15], regardless
of the patient’s intention to undergo HSCT. The selection
criteria for HSCT eligibility included an age of ≤65 years,
an ECOG performance status of ≤2, and no major organ
failure. This study was approved by the institutional
review board of the Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital at the
Catholic University of Korea, and complied with the
tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Treatment strategy and procedures
All patients received a standard HMT regimen of
azacitidine (75 mg/m²/day for 7 days) or decitabine (20
mg/m²/day for 5 days). According to our institution’s
guidelines regarding HSCT for higher-risk MDS,
transplantation was performed immediately after a donor
was available, regardless of the treatment cycle or response
to HMT. When patients experienced secondary AML after
HMT, induction chemotherapy was administered when
patients were judged to be able to tolerate the intensive
treatment. For conventional donor HSCT, the patients
underwent a preparative regimen of fludarabine (150
mg/m2) with 2 days or 4 days of intravenous busulfan
(3.2 mg/kg/day) and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin
(ATG; 5-10 mg/kg; Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). For
haploidentical related donor transplantation, the patients
underwent regimens of fludarabine (150 mg/m2) with 2
days of intravenous busulfan (3.2 mg/kg/day), total body
irradiation (800 cGy or 400 cGy), and ATG (5.0 mg/kg).
GVHD prophylaxis was performed using short-course
methotrexate (10 mg/m2 intravenous bolus on days +1, +3,
+6, and +11) plus cyclosporine for related donor HSCT or

semi-parametric proportional hazard model for the subdistribution of competing risks. The final models were
created using the backward conditional method. Most
statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software
(version 13.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and the
cumulative incidence analyses were performed using R
software (http://cran.r-project.org/).

Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed
after every 2 HMT cycles, based on the clinical needs,
and immediately before conditioning. Hematological
responses were only assessed when bone marrow was
obtained, and HI was assessed whenever complete blood
cell counting was performed, using the International
Working Group 2006 response criteria [47]. The best and
final responses (at HSCT) were defined as CR, partial
remission, mCR+HI, mCR-HI or SD+HI. Patients with
CR/mCR with or without HI were designated as marrow
response group. Non-responders and patients who had
failed to maintain a previous response at the time of
the HSCT were categorized as primary failure (SD-HI
or primary DP) and secondary failure (loss of response
or relapse), respectively [48]. Myeloid and platelet
engraftment was defined as the first of 3 consecutive days
with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≥ .5 x 109/L
and the first of 7 consecutive days with a platelet count ≥
20 x 109/L without transfusion, respectively. GVHD was
diagnosed and graded according to the clinical consensus
criteria [49, 50]. The hematopoietic cell transplantationcomorbidity index was estimated according to Sorror et
al. [51]. HMT-related mortality was arbitrarily defined as
death that occurred due to any event during the 42 days
after the final administration of HMT, in the absence of
DP, which was assessed using marrow blast counts.

Differences in the categorical and continuous
variables among the patient risk subgroups were compared
using the χ2 test, Fisher’s exact test, or Mann-Whitney’s
test, as appropriate. Time to event was assessed from the
infusion day. Events for DFS were relapse or death from
any cause, whereas death from any cause was a relevant
event for OS. TRM was defined as death from any cause
during continuous remission after HSCT. Survival curves
for OS and DFS were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier
method, and differences were evaluated using the log-rank
test. The cumulative incidence of TRM and relapse were
plotted and compared using the Gray test. The effects of
the covariates on OS and DFS were determined using the
Cox proportional hazard model. Factors were considered
significant if they exhibited a P-value of < 0.05 in a twotailed likelihood ratio test. The effects of the covariates
on the CIR and CITRM were determined using the
