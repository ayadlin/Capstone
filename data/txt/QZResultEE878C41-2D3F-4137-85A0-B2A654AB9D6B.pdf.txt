ABSTRACT
Despite evidence about the implication of the bone marrow (BM) stromal
microenvironment in multiple myeloma (MM) cell growth and survival, little is known
about the effects of myelomatous cells on BM stromal cells. Mesenchymal stromal
cells (MSCs) from healthy donors (dMSCs) or myeloma patients (pMSCs) were cocultured with the myeloma cell line MM.1S, and the transcriptomic profile of MSCs
induced by this interaction was analyzed. Deregulated genes after co-culture common
to both d/pMSCs revealed functional involvement in tumor microenvironment crosstalk, myeloma growth induction and drug resistance, angiogenesis and signals for
osteoclast activation and osteoblast inhibition. Additional genes induced by coculture were exclusively deregulated in pMSCs and predominantly associated to
RNA processing, the ubiquitine-proteasome pathway, cell cycle regulation, cellular
stress and non-canonical Wnt signaling. The upregulated expression of five genes
after co-culture (CXCL1, CXCL5 and CXCL6 in d/pMSCs, and Neuregulin 3 and Norrie
disease protein exclusively in pMSCs) was confirmed, and functional in vitro assays
revealed putative roles in MM pathophysiology. The transcriptomic profile of pMSCs
co-cultured with myeloma cells may better reflect that of MSCs in the BM of myeloma
patients, and provides new molecular insights to the contribution of these cells to MM
pathophysiology and to myeloma bone disease.

INTRODUCTION

non-hematopoietic cells, mainly of mesenchymal origin.
Cross-talk of myeloma cells with this microenvironment
is mediated by cell to cell, cell to ECM proteins or through
soluble regulatory factors such as cytokines, chemokines
and growth factors [3, 4]; protein, mRNA and miRNA
interchange via MSC-derived exosomes has recently been
reported as well [5]. These interactions have bidirectional
consequences: on the one hand, myeloma cells perturb the
BM homeostasis, causing anemia and immune suppression
[6]. Further, these interactions may uncouple normal bone
remodeling, reducing osteoblast (OB) differentiation and

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological
malignancy characterized by the abnormal expansion of
clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). It is widely
admitted that the behavior of malignant plasma cells is
not only dependent on their genomic abnormalities,
but also, on the complex and reciprocal relationships
of myeloma cells with their local BM niche [1, 2]. This
BM microenvironment is a multifunctional complex
network of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and

function and promoting osteoclast (OC) formation and
resorption, and leading to the development of osteolytic
bone lesions [7, 8]. On the other hand, interactions of
myeloma cells mostly with BM stromal cells and OCs,
activate pleiotropic cascades of proliferative, survival
and migration signaling pathways in myeloma cells, and
protect them from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis [1, 9].
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are the
progenitors of most of the stromal components of the
BM, capable of self-renewing and differentiation to
OBs, chondrocytes, reticular fibroblasts, adipocytes and
muscle cells [4, 10]. Several studies have compared MSCs
derived from the BM of myeloma patients (pMSCs) and
those from healthy donors (dMSCs) (reviewed in [11]).
Although pMSCs showed a similar immunophenotype to
that of dMSCs and supported long-term hematopoietic
growth in like fashion [12, 13], they functionally and
genetically differ from their healthy counterparts.
Isolated and expanded pMSCs in culture showed nonrecurrent genomic alterations [14], displayed a deficient
proliferative capacity and replicative potential [15] and
produced abnormally high amounts of certain cytokines
[12, 13, 16] compared to dMSCs. As well, pMSCs
showed a premature senescence profile [17] and presented
reduced efficiency to inhibit T-cell proliferation [18]
and to differentiate into the osteoblastic lineage [13], as
compared to dMSCs. In addition, gene expression profile
(GEP) analyses revealed differential expression of genes
in pMSCs coding for tumor-supportive and angiogenic
factors, as well as for factors contributing to bone disease
[13]. Even a distinct transcriptional pattern was found
associated to the occurrence of bone lesions in pMSCs
[19]. Since these differences have been found for isolated
dMSCs and pMSCs after in vitro expansion, they are
influenced by in vitro growth culture conditions and longterm absence of myeloma interactions in pMSCs [13, 20].
Therefore these differences may only partially reflect true
dissimilarities between pMSCs and dMSCs as occurring in
the BM milieu of myeloma patients and healthy subjects.
Although increasing number of studies are reporting on
the expression of specific genes in myeloma-interacting
MSCs [21-27], gene expression changes in co-cultured
MSCs (with respect to mono-culture conditions) have not
been done on a genome-wide basis.
Taking all this into consideration, in this work
we have established co-cultures between BM derived
MSCs and the MM.1S myeloma cell line, and performed
GEP studies on the MSC population to determine those
deregulated genes due to the co-culture condition with
respect to MSCs in mono-culture. Both dMSCs and
pMSCs have been used and compared. Our data provide
new insights in the understanding of the intercellular
communication signals between myeloma cells and
MSCs, and further delineate the pivotal role of MSCs in
the pathophysiology of MM and that of myeloma bone
disease (MBD).

Experimental setting and expression profiling
of d/pMSCs after co-culture with the MM.1S
myeloma cell line
Four experimental conditions using transwell
chambers were established as depicted in Fig. 1: (A)
dMSCs in co-culture with MM.1S cells; (B) pMSCs in
co-culture with MM.1S cells; (C) dMSCs cultured in the
same manner but without MM.1S cells; and (D) pMSCs
also cultured without MM.1S cells. Characteristics of
MM patients and healthy donors are detailed in Supp.
Table S1. After a 24 hour co-culture period, RNA was
isolated from separated MSC populations and used to
hybridize oligonucleotide microarrays. First, we identified
differentially expressed genes when comparing d/pMSC
samples in co-culture with d/pMSCs from the same origin
in mono-culture. Next, in order to identify differentially
expressed genes in d/pMSCs only due to the co-culture
condition, intrinsic differences between dMSCs and
pMSCs were excluded from the respective gene signatures
in the co-cultured condition, both for dMSCs and pMSCs.
Finally, by determining differentially deregulated genes
common to both dMSCs and pMSCs after co-culture,
we generated a deregulated “common list” of significant
genes [FDR (false discovery rate) < 0.05] (List I in Fig.
1), including 2583 genes, 699 upregulated and 1884
downregulated from mono-culture (Supp. Table S2). The
remaining differentially expressed genes observed in cocultured pMSCs but not present in the previous common
list were considered exclusive of pMSCs. This “exclusive
list” (List II in Fig.1) was set up with a FDR < 0.03, to
allow a similar number of genes as in List I (2553 genes:
1250 upregulated and 1303 downregulated with respect to
the mono-culture condition; Supp. Table S3).

Co-expression and cluster analyses of gene
signatures obtained for d/pMSCs co-cultured with
myelomatous cells
The expression heatmap from common deregulated
genes in co-culture (List I) discriminated two main
branches in the samples: one corresponding to the coculture condition, whereas the other corresponded to
mono-cultured MSCs. Confirming the semi-supervised
character of the analysis, MSCs from donor or patient
origin did not segregate within each branch, since genes
from intrinsic differences between dMSCs and pMSCs
in mono-culture were excluded (Fig. 2A). Similarly,
hierarchical clustering of data from deregulated genes in
co-culture exclusive of pMSCs (List II), showed a clear
segregation of samples from mono-culture and the co8285

Microarray comparisons were performed to identify deregulated genes in the co-culture condition for dMSCs and pMSCs after exclusion
of genes already differentially expressed in dMSCs and pMSCs in mono-culture ([A vs C] - [D vs C] = cc.dMSC GEP, and [B vs D] – [D

of List II, again not revealing additional functional
annotations to the ones observed with upregulated genes.
Diminished expression of certain genes in List II (such
as CST3, FZD5, WNT3, C/EBPB, and GLI1) could be
associated to inhibition of OB function due to their
reported osteogenic roles.
Manual curation was also used to reinforce coverage
of bioinformatic tools and to add not annotated functions
for genes with a reported role in myeloma pathogenesis
(end of Tables 1 and 2).

CXCL6 on the osteogenic or osteoclastogenic processes
(data not shown), we observed that CXCL1 functioned
as a chemoattractant for OC precursors (Fig. 3F), which
express CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors [32]. In the
myeloma setting, this may favour their accumulation at
sites of myeloma growth, where they could eventually
differentiate to functional OCs. Finally, only CXCL6
moderately, but significatively, increased the adhesion of
the MM.1S cell line to either d/pMSCs (Fig. 3G).

Neuregulin-3

Putative roles of CXCL1, CXCL5 and CXCL6
chemokines in myeloma pathophysiology

The expression and/or activation of the epidermal
growth factor (EGF) family of tyrosine kinase receptors,
such as ErbB receptors, has been shown to be implicated
in normal plasma cell differentiation and in myeloma
biology [33, 34]. Neuregulin-3 (NRG3), a member of
the EGF family ligands, was selected from List II and
its increased expression after co-culture only in pMSCs
was validated by real-time PCR (Fig. 4A). To test the
specific capacity of NRG3 to activate its unique ErbB4
receptor and to function as a myeloma growth factor, we
obtained the conditioned medium (CM) of MM.1S and
pMSCs direct co-cultures. SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells,
which show high expression of the ErbB4 receptor, were
exposed to this CM and NRG3-specific ErbB4 activation
was observed after appropriate inmmunoprecipitation and
immunoblotting procedures (Fig. 4B). This CM was also
able to increase the growth rate of the RPMI8226-luc cell
line, being its proliferating activity in great part dependent
on NRG3 (Fig. 4C).

The high level of expression and significance of
three C-X-C motif chemokines (CXCL1/GROα, CXCL5/
ENA-78 and CXCL6/GCP-2) selected from List I was
particularly interesting due to the known function of
chemokines as regulators of multiple physiological and
pathological processes. In agreement with our microarray
data, CXCL1, CXCL5 and CXCL6 mRNA levels were
shown to be highly upregulated in MSCs from both origins
after co-culture (Fig. 3A-C).
The signaling receptor for CXCL1 and CXCL5 is
CXCR2, while CXCL6 signals both through CXCR1 and
CXCR2 [28]. Previous studies have demonstrated the
presence of CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors on MM cell
lines and plasma cells from MM patients [29], suggesting
that our selected chemokines may act as paracrine factors
upon neoplastic plasma cells. We first tested the effect of
recombinant human (rh) CXCL1, CXCL5 and CXCL6
on proliferation of the multiple myeloma MM.1S-luc cell
line. As shown in Fig. 3D, the three chemokines dosedependently and significantly increased the proliferation
rate of MM.1S-luc cells by maximal effects of 39%, 54%
and 35%, respectively.
A well-stablished role for several members of the
CXC chemokine family is the promotion of angiogenesis
[30]. When we tested the putative angiogenic potential
of the three chemokines, an increasing dose-response in
the tubule formation assay was found for CXCL1 and
CXCL5, even at lower concentrations than those required
to induce myeloma growth (Fig. 3E). Since IL8 has been
reported as an angiogenic factor in MM [31], is highly
overexpressed by d/pMSCs after co-culture (Supp. Table
S2) and also signals through CXCR1 and CXCR2 [28], we
explored the possibility of CXCL1 and CXCL5 presenting
a synergistic angiogenic effect with IL8. Combination of
sub-maximal concentrations of CXCL1 and CXCL5 with
IL8 seemed to render at least an additive effect in the
endothelial tube formation assay (see Supp. Fig. S1).
MBD is characterized by a double component of
increased OC formation and resorption, whereas OB
formation and function are impaired [7, 8]. Although we
did not find any significative effect of CXCL1, CXCL5 or
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Norrie Disease Protein
The Norrie disease protein (NDP) is a secreted
protein recently identified as a non-conventional Wnt
ligand capable of activating the canonical Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway, via specific binding to frizzled receptor
FZD4 and low density lipoprotein related LRP5/6 coreceptor [35]. In accordance with our data in List II, realtime PCR showed NDP to be highly overexpressed in cocultured pMSCs, whereas it was even repressed in dMSCs
after co-culture (Fig. 4D). In this study, we show that rh
NDP was able to promote the growth of the RPMI8226luc cell line (Fig. 4E) and to induce the formation of
capillary tubes in the BMEC-1 cell line (see Fig. 4F) in a
significative and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, NDP
was able to induce osteoclastogenesis from peripheral
blood mononuclear cells of healthy subjects in a dosedependent manner in the presence of M-CSF (macrophage
colony-stimulating factor) and absence of RANKL
(receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B ligand) (Fig. 4G).

Co-culture of bone marrow d/pMSCs with other
myeloma cells and leukemia cell lines

Transcription factor profile analysis
The analysis of putative transcription factor binding
sites (TFBS) in the promoter regions of our deregulated
genes in MSCs after co-culture (Lists I and II), allowed to
infer the main TFs which might be regulating the observed
changes in gene expression after co-culture with the
MM.1S cell line (Supp. Table S4A). TFs with the highest
number of TFBS and gene hits were Elk1 [36] and Gfi1
[37] in List I; and Elk4 [36] and GABPA [38] in List II.
Interestingly, in the myeloma context, Gfi1 has recently
been pointed out as a new transcriptional repressor of
Runx2, blocking OB differentiation and being increased
both in MSCs from MM patients and MM-bearing mice
[24]. Among the multiple target genes regulated by these
four transcription factors, many have been reported to be
critical for MM pathogenesis (Supp. Table S4B).

In order to get a cue of whether the observed GEPs
in d/pMSCs after interaction with the MM.1S cell line
were representative of transcriptional changes in MSCs
in the myeloma context, co-cultures were performed with
primary CD138+ myeloma cells and with other established
MM cell lines (i. e. RPMI8226, OPM-2 and JJN3). The
expression levels of the 5 selected genes in our study (i.e.
CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL6, NRG3 and NDP) together with
the expression of 5 additional deregulated genes from our
analyses [WNT5A, IL8, MMP12 (matrix metallopeptidase
12) -from List I-; and ASPM (abnormal spindle homolog,
microcephaly associated) and HMMR (hyaluronanmediated motility receptor) -from List II-], were evaluated
by real-time PCR (Figs. 5A, B). As observed in Fig. 5A,
an upregulated expression of the 10 genes under study
was observed in pMSCs when they were co-cultured with
CD138+ myeloma cells, with even higher fold changes
in co-culture than with the MM.1S cell line. A more
heterogeneous response was observed, however, in d/
pMSCs co-cultured with the RPMI8226, OPM-2 or the
JJN3 cell lines (Fig. 5B). Although increased expression
levels were evident for most of the genes under study, fold
changes varied relative to co-culture with the MM.1S cell
line. Also, the “pMSC exclusive” condition of genes from
List II (NDP, NRG3, ASPM and HMMR) was lost in cocultures with these other MM cell lines, since increased
expression was observed on both dMSCs and pMSCs.
To test whether the gene expression changes in
BM MSCs also occurred after interaction with other
types of tumor cells, the relative expression levels of
our set of genes was evaluated in d/pMSCs after coculture with HEL (erythroleukemia) and MEC-1 (chronic
B lymphocytic leukemia) human cell lines (Fig. 5C).
These two cell lines were selected as representatives of
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) tumor cells, since similarly to MM, these
two hematologic malignancies course with accumulation
of tumor cells in the BM microenvironment. Of interest,
an exacerbated expression of some of the evaluated genes
(i. e. CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL6, IL8) and strong expression
of others (i. e. NDP, NRG3, MMP12) was observed in
d/pMSCs after co-culture with the leukemic cell lines,
which is suggestive of a specific role for these molecules
in the biology of these hematological tumors. Other genes
from List II (i. e. ASPM and HMMR) did not greatly vary
their expression in co-culture with HEL or MEC-1cell
lines with respect to mono-culture conditions, perhaps
insinuating a more exclusive role of these molecules in
MM pathophysiology.

DISCUSSION
During the last two decades, the importance of
the tumor microenvironment for the acquisition of
cancer capabilities by neoplasic cells and thus for cancer
progression, has become increasingly clear [39, 40]. In the
case of MM, the well-organized cellular and functional
architecture of the BM is converted into a “privileged”
tumor microenvironment greatly supporting the growth,
progression, survival and drug resistance of myelomatous
cells [3]. Therefore, the design of better and more
effective anti-myeloma treatments partly relies on a better
understanding of the reciprocal interactions of myeloma
and tumor microenvironment cells in the BM. Being MSCs
a relevant component of the tumor microenvironment in
MM, in this study we have specifically focused on the
“not so much studied” gene expression changes in MSCs
induced by interaction with myeloma cells; these changes
in MSCs further contribute to myeloma growth, survival
and progression and compromise normal MSC function
(e. g. contributing to the reduced pMSC osteogenic
potential). It should be noted that the ability to induce gene
expression changes in BM derived-MSCs is not exclusive
of myeloma tumor cells. In fact, specific gene expression
changes were observed for a subset of 10 selected genes
from our study when d/pMSCs were co-cultured with
acute myeloid and chronic lymphocytic leukemica cell
lines (see Fig. 5C). Our piece of data not only gives
further evidence of the important role of the BM stromal
microenvironment in these hematological malignancies
[41-44], but also opens the door for future research based
on genome-wide expression studies in BM stromal cells
interacting with leukemia cells.
In our study, we specifically illustrate a
comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of BM-derived
MSCs (from healthy donors and MM patients) after
establishment of both cellular and molecular interactions

with the MM.1S myeloma plasma cell line. We believe
that the GEP of MSCs after interaction with the MM.1S
cell line may be representative of gene expression changes
as occurring in pMSCs in the BM of myeloma patients.
In fact, a similar relative expression for the commented
10 selected genes from our analyses was observed in
pMSCs after co-culture with either the MM.1S cell line or
primary myeloma cells (Fig. 5A). However, it should also
be acknowledged that some differences in gene expression
changes for the same subset of genes were observed in d/
pMSCs co-cultured with different MM cell lines (Fig. 5B).
This may be indicative of qualitative and/or time-course
differences in gene expression changes induced in MSCs
when interacting with different types of myeloma cells.
Apart from a better understanding of the complex
interactions between myeloma cells and MSCs, our
analyses intended to identify deregulated pathways in
MSCs due to these interactions which may influence the
progression, therapeutic resistance, dissemination of MM
and/or development of MBD. We also aimed to gain some
insight into the evolution of the disease by determining
which myeloma-induced transcripts were common
to dMSCs and pMSCs and which were deregulated
exclusively in pMSCs.

the three selected highly upregulated chemokines
in co-cultured d/pMSCs (i. e. CXCL1, CXCL5 and
CXCL6) supported important roles in myeloma growth,
angiogenesis, recruitment of OC precursors and myelomacell adhesion. In fact, serum levels of CXCL1 and
CXCL5 chemokines have been found to be significantly
elevated in MM patients, and in the case of CXCL1, to
increase with disease stage [57]. Serum concentrations of
CXCL1 and CXCL5 in myeloma patients were below the
concentrations used in our in vitro studies (186.5 ± 129.1
pg/ml and 765 572.1 pg/ml, respectively [57]). However,
higher physiological concentrations of these cytokines are
expected to be found in the BM at sites of MSC-myeloma
cell interactions, which would support their angiogenic
and myeloma growth activities. When we entered these
three genes as a query in the GeneMANIA-Cytoscape
tool, an association network of 22 genes was represented
(Fig. 6A). Importantly, 16/22 of the nodules appearing
in the network were included in List I. Some of the
nodules not present in List I (e. g. CXCR1, CXCR2 and
DARC) corresponded to common receptors for the three
cytokines, suggesting a paracrine activity of the secreted
CXCL chemokines on myeloma cells or other cells in
the BM microenvironment. Represented interactions of
these chemokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP9,
MMP1 and MMP3) may be related to ECM remodeling
associated to chemokine activity; alternatively, these
interactions may respond to posttranslational cleavage of
the chemokines to modify their biological potency [58].
Other nodules in the network correspond to cytokines
with known function in myeloma pathophysiology and/
or in osteolytic lesions (IL6, IL1β, CCL2, IL8 and
CCL20) [8, 28, 59]. Specifically, IL8, being one of the
most highly overexpressed genes in co-cultured d/pMSCs
in our study, has been found to be elevated in serum of
MM patients [31]. IL8 expression in myeloma has been
related not only to increased angiogenesis [31], but
also to proliferation and chemotaxis of myeloma cells
[60] and stimulation of osteoclastogenesis and bone
resorption [61]. Another upregulated gene in co-cultured
MSCs and shown in the network is that corresponding to
the non-canonical Wnt ligand Wnt5A. Wnt5a has been
identified by GEP analyses as a myeloma growth factor
expressed in myeloma cells and OCs from myeloma
patients [20]. Although Wnt5a has been reported to
promote osteoblastogenesis of human MSCs through Fzd
receptors and Ror2 [62], it has been found that myeloma
cells in co-culture with pre-OBs inhibit Ror2 expression
in the latter, thus impairing osteogenic differentiation
and contributing to OB suppression [63]. Interestingly,
increased osteoclastogenesis has been found to be
mediated by signaling between Wnt5a (secreted by OBlineage cells) and the membrane receptor Ror2 (expressed
in OC precursors) [64], which suggests that the Wnt5aRor2 axis may contribute to increased OC formation and
bone resorption in MBD.

Deregulated genes after co-culture common to
dMSCs and pMSCs (List I)
The differentially upregulated genes in List I were
functionally linked to: i) a chemokine/cytokine response,
since these molecules have effectively been implicated in
several aspects of MM biology (myeloma cell proliferation
and survival, homing and/or drug resistance, angiogenesis,
OC precursor recruitment and bone destruction) [1, 2, 28];
ii) an immune and inflammatory response, which could
be related to the reported diminished immunomodulatory
potential of pMSCs [18]; iii) angiogenesis (e. g.
ANGPTL4, FGF2) [13, 31]; iv) microenvironment crosstalk, including cell-matrix adhesion (e. g. COL12A1,
ITGB1) or integrin-mediated and extracellular matrix
remodelation (e. g. ITGA2, ITGAM, VCAM1, MMP1,
MMP3, MMP9, MMP12) [3, 45, 46]; and v) bone biology
and skeletal development [(e. g. SPP1 (osteopontin)
[47]]. Manual curation based on the literature, further
revealed functions of these deregulated genes related to
myeloma growth and drug resistance (e. g. IL6, CCL3,
HGF, FN1) [3, 20, 48], OC formation and/or activation
(e. g. CCL3, CCL20, LIF) [26, 48, 49] and inhibition
of OB differentiation and function (e. g. CCL3, EREG)
[50, 51]. Other molecules identified as promoters of
OB differentiation and/or function in myeloma (e. g.
EFNB2, HMOX1) [52, 53] and in other contexts (e. g.
CD276, BMP7, IL6ST) [54-56], showed a downregulated
expression after co-culture (Supp. Table S2).

issues.
Other genes exclusively upregulated in pMSCs and
not directly included in the commented functions (Table
2, “Other functions not annotated”), might be implicated
in several aspects of myeloma pathophysiology, such
as myeloma cell adhesion and growth (e. g. ANXA2P1,
ANXA2P2 [23]), or inhibition of OB differentiation (e.
g. GFI1 [24]). The downregulated expression of several
genes in pMSCs after co-culture (e. g. CST3 [76], FZD5
[72], WNT3 [77], C/EBPB [78], and GLI1 [79]; see Supp.
Table S3) may also contribute to the reported impairment
of OB function in MM.
The putative role of the upregulated expression of
NRG3 and NDP from List II was also explored. NRG3
and its receptor have been found to be expressed in
myeloma cells but not in their normal counterparts [34].
Besides, NRG3 has been reported to be significantly
overexpressed by myeloma cells as compared to other
cells in the BM microenvironment [20]. In this study, we
show that pMSCs co-cultured with myeloma cells also
secrete NRG3, which is able of activating ErbB4 and
to promote myeloma proliferation, thereby creating a
paracrine amplification loop for myeloma growth. On the
other hand, our experiments showed that rh NDP increased
the growth of a MM cell line and induced the formation of
capillary tubes, being the latter capability in line with the
reported function of NDP in the control of formation of
retinal capillaries [35]. Interestingly, we also showed that
NDP increased OC formation in the presence of M-CSF
and absence of RANKL. Since as far as we know NDP has
not been related to myeloma, our data suggest a putative
role for this factor in the pathophysiology of the disease
and in the development of ostelytic lesions.
Some authors have proposed the idea of a coevolution of MSCs and myeloma cells along the course
of the disease [3, 11]. In this sense, dMSCs would
progressively convert to pMSCs, being the interactions
with myelomatous cells determinant for those changes.
Consistent with this hypothesis, common deregulated
genes in MSCs after 24 hours of co-culture with MM.1S
cells may daringly be considered as gene expression
changes occurring in MSCs at initial phases of myeloma
(i. e. production of myeloma growth and angiogenic
factors, chemokines, chemoattraction of OC precursors,
OC activation and OB inhibition). Following the same
line of reasoning, genes deregulated after co-culture
exclusively found in pMSCs, may perhaps be considered
as expression changes predominantly affecting proper
MSCs at latter stages of myeloma disease (i. e. changes
in MSCs to cope with enhanced protein secretion, cellular
response to stress, and regulation of Wnt signaling).
In summary, we have shown that the transcriptomic
profile of pMSCs co-cultured with myeloma cells greatly
differs from that of MSCs in mono-culture, may better
reflect the expression signature of MSCs in the BM
of myeloma patients, and provides new insights to the

Two of the major functions associated to deregulated
genes in List II were RNA processing and activation of
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP). These functions
probably reflect the response of pMSCs to cope with
the high transcriptional and protein secretory load after
myeloma cell interaction. Upregulated expression of genes
implicated in mRNA maturation and disposal of misfolded
proteins would likely be necessary for pMSCs to maintain
an adequate cellular function. Interestingly, upregulated
expression of transcripts from the UPP were also found
in the transcriptional signature of myeloma cells in the
presence of stromal cells [65].
Wnt signaling is a critical pathway for OB
differentiation and bone metabolism [66, 67] which is also
deregulated in pMSCs after co-culture. Commitment of
MSCs to osteogenic differentiation and to promotion of
bone formation has majorly been associated to activation
of the Wnt canonical pathway [66, 68]; however,
mounting evidence is arising for non-canonical Wnt
signaling also regulating OB differentiation and function
[69-72]. Altogether, our analyses seem to point out an
inhibition of the canonical Wnt signaling in co-cultured
pMSCs (see Fig. 6B), both because of upregulated
expression of several non-canonical Wnt ligands (WNT5A,
WNT5B -from List I-, WNT7A and WNT16 -from List
II-), and because of upregulated expression of negative
regulators of β-catenin (APC, RBX1 and FBXW1) which
would promote β-catenin ubiquitination for proteasome
degradation [73]. Besides, the upregulated expression of
some members of the non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ and Planar
Cell Polarity pathways (e. g. CDC42 and ROCK1), may
perhaps indicate a possible enhancement of the migration
and invasiveness properties of co-cultured pMSCs as some
authors have described in other cell types [74].
Both d/pMSCs after co-culture show a deregulated
expression of genes involved in proliferation and
apoptosis. More specifically, pMSCs after interaction with
MM.1S cells also present upregulated expression of genes
implicated in cell cycle regulation (including numerous
mitotic spindle components as well as interphase and
mitosis checkpoints; see Tables 1 and 2, and Supp.
Tables S2 and S3 [75]). Besides, deregulated genes in
co-cultured pMSCs present functional association with
cellular response to stress (including genes transduction
to oxidative-stress stimuli, endoplasmic reticulum stress
and DNA damage response; Table 2). Taken together,
interactions with myeloma cells seem to greatly influence
the proliferative potential of MSCs, which may be related
to the reduced growth rate of pMSCs and/or the premature
onset of senescence observed in pMSCs when grown
in vitro as compared to dMSCs [15, 17]. Further gene
expression and functional studies on MSCs with longer
co-culture times are warranted to shed light onto these

contribution of interacting MSCs to the pathophysiology
of MM and MBD. Our data also bring up the issue that due
to interactions with myeloma cells, MSCs are modified
from a dMSC phenotype to one bearing the prototypic
characteristics of pMSCs. Further, our studies support that
therapeutic targeting of myeloma-stromal cell interactions
would benefit from both an anti-myeloma effect and from
maintenance of appropriate MSC function.

isolation and expansion (d/pMSCs) or for isolation of
CD138+ primary plasma cells.
Research was conducted in accordance to ethical
standards and principles expressed in the Declaration of
Helsinki. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board from the Centro de Investigación del
Cáncer, IBMCC (University of Salamanca-CSIC, Spain).

Primary MSCs from BM samples of healthy
donors (n=11) and MM patients (n=17) were isolated
and expanded as described by Garayoa et al. [14]. At
passage 2, d/pMSCs were used in co-culture experiments
with the MM.1S cell line and subsequently subjected to
GEP analyses (clinical characteristics of patients used are
shown in Supp. Table S1). In addition, some d/pMSCs
were co-cultured with leukemia cell lines or primary MM
cells, or utilized in OB differentiation experiments.
Methods for in vitro OB (n=4) and OC (n=4)
differentiation have been previously reported [81]. Briefly,
OC precursors were generated from PBMCs of healthy
donors in α-MEM with 10% FBS and antibiotics and
supplemented with 25 ng/ml M-CSF for 4 days; OBs were
differentiated from primary MSCs by culture in osteogenic
medium containing β-glycerol phosphate, ascorbic acid
and dexamethasone.

Reagents and immunochemicals
Recombinant human (rh) CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL6,
M-CSF and RANKL were purchased from PeproTech and
rh NDP from R&D Systems. Primary antibodies were
produced in-house (ErbB4) or purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (p-Tyr, NRG3). Trypan Blue solution 0.4%
was delivered by Sigma-Aldrich, cell culture media and
supplements by Gibco (Life Technologies), and epidermal
growth factor (EGF) and Matrigel from BD Biosciences.

Primary CD138+ plasma cells
Two BM samples from untreated myeloma patients
at diagnosis were used to isolate primary myeloma cells
via CD138-positive selection using the AutoMACs
separation system (Miltenyi-Biotec) with a final purity
> 95%. These primary myeloma cells were subsequently
used in co-culture studies with pMSCs.

Cells and culture conditions

Co-culture system

Cell lines

Co-cultures were performed using a 6-well format
transwell system with 1 µm pore size membrane (BD
Biosciences). Briefly, 1.2 x 105 MSCs (passage 2) were
first cultured attached to the lower side of the membrane,
and when a confluency of ≅ 85% was reached, 1 x 106
MM.1S cells were seeded on the upper side (see Supp
Methods, co-culture system). After a 24 hour co-culture
in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
antibiotics, d/pMSCs were recovered by trypsinization and
processed for total RNA extraction (Qiagen).

The human MM cell line MM.1S was provided
by Dr ST Rosen (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL,
USA), whereas the MM.1S-luc cell line was donated
by Dr CS Mitsiades (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
Boston, MA, USA). RPMI8226 cells purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were
lentivirally transduced to stably express firefly luciferase
as in Groen et al. [80]. Other established MM cell lines
(OPM-2, JJN3), together with the erythroleukemia
(HEL) and chronic B lymphocytic leukemia (MEC1) cell lines were purchased from the Leibniz Institute
DSMZ biosource center. All hematological tumor
cell lines were periodically authentified by STR DNA
profiling, and grown in RPMI 1640 medium or IMDM

using JASPAR and TRANSFAC databases.

Real-time PCR analysis

After assessment of RNA integrity (Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer, Agilent), biotinylated complementary RNA
was synthesized (Enzo) and hybridized to HG-U133
Plus 2.0 GeneChip oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix).
Quantitation of fluorescence intensities of probesets was
done using the GeneArray Scanner (Hewlett Packard).
Microarray data have been deposited at GEO database
(ref GSE46053).

TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) were used according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Assay IDs were: CXCL1,
Hs00236937_m1; CXCL5, Hs00171085_m1; CXCL6,
Hs00237017_m1; NRG3, Hs01377907_m1; NDP,
Hs00181129_m1; WNT5A, Hs00998537_m1; IL8,
Hs00174103_m1; MMP-12, Hs 00899662_m1; ASPM, Hs
00411505_m1; HMMR, Hs00234864_m1. Experiments
were performed as previously described [81].

Microarray data analysis: normalization, signal
calculation, differential gene expression and
clustering

Proliferation assay
MM.1S-luc cells were seeded in 96-well plates (1 x
104 cells/well) in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.1% FBS and
specified concentrations of each recombinant protein. After
72 hours, firefly luciferine was added and bioluminescence
measured in a Xenogen IVIS 50 Bioluminiscent System
(Caliper Life Sciences).

The RMA (robust multi-array average) algorithm
was applied for background correction, intra- and
inter-microarray
normalization
and
expression
signal calculation. The SAM (significance analysis
of microarrays) algorithm was used to identify gene
probesets displaying significant differential expression
when comparing d/pMSCs after co-culture with MSCs
from the same origin in mono-culture, using p-value cutoffs determined by the FDR method. The corresponding
matrix of expression values was analyzed with the
hierarchical cluster analysis using algorithm hclust. All
these methods were applied using R (http://www.r-project.
org) and Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org).

Migration assay
We used a 24-well plate with transwells having
5.0 µm pore size membranes (Corning). Serial dilutions
of recombinant proteins in α-MEM with 0.5% FBS were
placed in the lower chamber, whereas macrophages (2 x
105 cells/100 µl) were added to the upper chamber. After
3 hours, cells that had migrated and adhered to the bottom
of the lower chamber were stained with haematoxylin and
counted with Trypan Blue solution.

Gene functional enrichment analysis
Functional enrichment analysis was performed on
selected sets of genes after differential expression analyses
using two bioinformatics tools: DAVID Bioinformatics
Resources 6.7 (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) [82] and
GeneTerm Linker (http://gtlinker.dacya.ucm.es/) [83]. The
gene sets analyzed for functional enrichment were the most
significant from List I (upregulated genes with FDR<0.03)
and List II (upregulated genes with FDR<0.02). The
downregulated significant genes were also analyzed in
separated runs. For construction and analysis of gene
functional networks we used the GeneMANIA resource
(http://www.genemania.org/) and Cytoscape (http://www.
cytoscape.org/).

Tube formation assay
BMEC-1 cells (5 x 103 cells/well) were seeded onto
Matrigel-coated 96-well plates in MCDB 131 medium
supplemented with 0.1% FBS and indicated doses of the
recombinant proteins. After 5 hours, tubule-like structures
were counted using a 1 mm2 grid, and photographed in an
Axiovert 135 (Zeiss) microscope.

Adhesion assay	
Both d/pMSCs (1 x 104 cells/well) were incubated
in 96-well plates for 24 hours and then MM.1S-luc cells
(1 x 105 cells/well) were added to the monolayer in serumfree medium with specified doses of recombinant proteins.
After 3.5 hour incubation, unbound MM.1S-luc cells were
removed with three gentle PBS washes and adhered cells
quantified by bioluminescence.

Transcription factor profile analysis
Prediction of transcriptional regulators for the
differentially expressed genes was obtained using
TransFind and oPOSSUM tools (http://transfind.sys-bio.
net/; http://burgundy.cmmt.ubc.ca/oPOSSUM/), which
look for enrichment in consensus transcription factor
binding sites (TFBS) in promoters of specific gene sets
