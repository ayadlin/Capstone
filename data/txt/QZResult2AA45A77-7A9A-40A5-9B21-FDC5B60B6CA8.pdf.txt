Abstract
High expression of Notch-1 and Jagged-1 mRNA correlates with
poor prognosis in breast cancer. Elucidating the cross-talk
between Notch and other major breast cancer pathways is
necessary to determine which patients may benefit from Notch
inhibitors, which agents should be combined with them, and
which biomarkers indicate Notch activity in vivo. We explored
expression of Notch receptors and ligands in clinical specimens, as well as activity, regulation, and effectors of Notch
signaling using cell lines and xenografts. Ductal and lobular
carcinomas commonly expressed Notch-1, Notch-4, and
Jagged-1 at variable levels. However, in breast cancer cell
lines, Notch-induced transcriptional activity did not correlate
with Notch receptor levels and was highest in estrogen receptor
A–negative (ERA ), Her2/Neu nonoverexpressing cells. In
ERA+ cells, estradiol inhibited Notch activity and Notch-1IC
nuclear levels and affected Notch-1 cellular distribution.
Tamoxifen and raloxifene blocked this effect, reactivating
Notch. Notch-1 induced Notch-4. Notch-4 expression in clinical
specimens correlated with proliferation (Ki67). In MDA-MB231
(ERA ) cells, Notch-1 knockdown or ;-secretase inhibition
decreased cyclins A and B1, causing G2 arrest, p53-independent
induction of NOXA, and death. In T47D:A18 (ERA+) cells, the
same targets were affected, and Notch inhibition potentiated
the effects of tamoxifen. In vivo , ;-secretase inhibitor
treatment arrested the growth of MDA-MB231 tumors and, in
combination with tamoxifen, caused regression of T47D:A18
tumors. Our data indicate that combinations of antiestrogens
and Notch inhibitors may be effective in ERA+ breast cancers
and that Notch signaling is a potential therapeutic target in
ERA breast cancers. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5226–35]

Delta and Jagged/Serrate families (1). Mature Notch receptors are
heterodimers composed of a transmembrane subunit (NTM)
associated with an extracellular subunit (NEC). On ligand binding,
NTM is cleaved by an ADAM metalloproteinase and g-secretase.
This releases a cytoplasmic subunit (NIC), which activates CSL
transcription factors, modulating cell fate decisions (1).
Deregulated expression of wild-type Notch receptors, ligands,
and targets has been described in several solid tumors (1–3).
Approximately 50% of T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL)
carry activating Notch-1 mutations (4). Mutations in ubiquitin
ligase FBW7/SEL10/CDC4 also increase Notch activity in T-ALL
(5–7). Intracellular forms of Notch receptors have transforming
activity in vitro (8) and in vivo (9–11).
Constitutive activation of Notch-1 (12, 13) or Notch-4 (11) causes
mammary carcinogenesis in mice. In human breast cancer, highlevel expression of Notch-1 and Jagged-1 correlates with poor
prognosis (14, 15). Aberrant Notch-1 activation was reported in 20
breast carcinomas of various subtypes (16). These authors showed
that Notch-1 NIC transforms MCF-10 cell and protects transformed cells from p53-mediated induction of proapoptotic protein
NOXA. Pece and colleagues (17) suggested that Notch negative
regulator Numb is lost in f50% of human breast carcinomas,
leading to increased Notch signaling. We showed that activation of
Notch-1 maintains the neoplastic phenotype and induces Notch-4
in Ras-transformed human fibroblasts and kidney epithelial cells
(18). In the same study, we detected expression of Notch-1 in seven
cases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma, which seemed stronger in
H-Ras–overexpressing cases (18). We investigated the expression of
Notch pathway components in human breast cancers and the
regulation of Notch expression and activity by a novel cross-talk
mechanism with estrogen. We present data supporting the
hypothesis that Notch inhibitors may be effective in estrogen
receptor a–negative (ERa ) breast cancers and that combinations
including an antiestrogen and a Notch inhibitor may be effective in
ERa+ disease.

from Dr. Debra A. Tonetti (University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL).
Human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) were from Clonetics. See
Supplementary Data for medium details. For coculture experiments, breast
cancer cells were cocultured with mouse OP9 stromal cells overexpressing
Notch ligand Delta-1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing OP9
negative controls (gifts of Dr. Juan-Carlos Zuniga-Pflucker, University of
Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Notch constructs and CBF-1
luciferase reporter assays have been described (18). The pKA9-CBF-1
used for stable transfection of T47D:A18 (19) was a gift of Dr. Dmitry
Gabrilovich (University of South Florida, Tampa, FL). The full-length
Notch-1 tagged at the COOH terminus with Renilla luciferase (20) was a
gift of Dr. Raphael Kopan (Washington University, St. Louis, MO).
Drugs and chemicals. g-Secretase inhibitor cbz-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (GSI;
Calbiochem) was dissolved in DMSO, aliquoted, and stored at 80jC. 17hEstradiol, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OH-TAM; both from Sigma-Aldrich),
fulvestrant (ICI182,780; Tocris Bioscience), and raloxifene (kindly donated
by Dr. Judy Bolton, University of Illinois at Chicago) were dissolved in
ethanol and stored in aliquots at 80jC.
RNA interference. Double-stranded synthetic 21-mer RNA oligonucleotides (siRNA) were from Dharmacon and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. siRNA
effectiveness was validated by Western blotting and real-time reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR; data not shown). siRNA from Dharmacon was
synthesized based on sequences we identified. The most effective sequences
selected in pilot experiments were the following: Notch-1, 5¶-AAGTGTCTGAGGCCAGCAAGA-3¶; Notch-4, 5¶-AACCCTGTGCCAATGGAGGCA-3¶. A
control siRNA that does not match any known mammalian Genbank
sequences (Dharmacon) was used in all experiments: 5¶-AACAGTCGCGTTTGCGACTGG-3¶. See Supplementary Data for additional details.
Western blotting. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer containing protease inhibitors. See Supplementary Data for
additional details. Antibodies used were the following: Notch-1 (C-20),
Notch-4 (L-16), cyclin B (H-433), and c-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); cyclin A (BF68; Cell Signaling); phospho-histone 3 (Ser10; Cell
Signaling); and NOXA (Calbiochem).
Transfection and luciferase assays. Cells were transfected using either
FuGene (Roche Diagnostic) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. For cells grown in charcoal-stripped
medium, electroporation was used to ensure high efficiency of transfection.
Luciferase assay was performed using the Dual Luciferase Assay by
Promega using pRL-TK (Renilla luciferase) as internal control.
Proliferation, growth inhibition, and chemoinvasion assays. Growth
of attached cells was estimated by a standard assay used for cancer drug
screening by either sulforhodamine (21) or crystal violet (22) staining of
fixed cells. BioCoat Matrigel invasion chambers (Becton Dickinson) were
used to assay matrix invasion following the manufacturer’s instructions. See
Supplementary Data for details.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells (106) were washed twice in PBS and then fixed
in 80% methanol. Fixed cells were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in
50 AL propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL in PBS). After RNase A (100 Ag/mL)
treatment at 37jC for 1 h, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a
FACSCalibur instrument.
Real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted using a commercially
available kit (Qiagen) and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for mRNA for
Notch-1 and HEY1. See Supplementary Data for details.
RNase protection assays. Total RNA was extracted using a commercially available kit (Qiagen). The assay was performed using the RiboQuant
RPA Starter Package (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Biotinylation experiments. T47D:A18 cell surface proteins were
biotinylated in the presence or absence of 17h-estradiol. The amount of
Notch-1 on cell membrane was then measured by immunoprecipitation of
the biotinylated form of Notch followed by Western blot. See Supplementary
Data for additional details.
Confocal microscopy. T47D:A18 and MCF-7 cells were grown on LabTek II chamber slides (Nunc) for 48 h in charcoal-stripped serum plus
1 nmol/L estradiol or 1 Amol/L 4-OH-TAM. Cells were rinsed twice in
PBS and fixed in cold methanol. Staining for Notch-1 was performed using

www.aacrjournals.org

1 Ag/mL C-20 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 5 Ag/mL of Alexa
Fluor 488–labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). Detection was performed
with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using a C-Apochromat 63/1.2
W correlation objective.
Statistical analysis. (a) Preclinical studies: For pairwise comparisons,
two-tailed unpaired Student’s t tests were used with a = 0.05. When more
than two samples were compared, one-way ANOVA was used (StudentNewman-Keuls method for multiple comparisons) with a = 0.05. SigmaStat
software (Jandel Scientific) was used for preclinical statistical analysis. (b)
Clinical studies: Associations involving two-class variables with multilevel
variables were performed using a m2 test and Fisher’s exact test statistic. For
the analysis of the association between Notch-1 and Notch-4 staining with
other variables, we calculated the least square means for each level of Notch
staining. Data were parsed into three levels (low, medium, and intense
staining). Staining distribution was distinguished into cytoplasmic, nuclear,
and membrane. We found a significant association between Ki67 staining
and cytoplasmic Notch-4 (P < 0.02). The least square mean values for Ki67
for low, medium, and intense staining were 13.50, 35.00, and 13.20,
respectively. The association between Ki67 and Notch-1 staining was only
marginal (P = 0.06), with least square mean values for Ki67 breast of 15.83,
32.50, and 33.00 for the low, medium, and intense staining, respectively.
Clinical statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Analysis
System software package.
Promoter analysis. The analysis of the cyclin A and cyclin B promoters
for nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) motifs was performed using Motif Search and
AliBaba2.1.
Xenograft experiments. Ovariectomized 4- to 6-week-old BALB/c
athymic mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were injected s.c. into both axillary
mammary fat pads with either 5  106 MDA-MB231 cells or 1  107
T47D:A18 cells. Tumor size was determined weekly. At the end of treatment,
animals were sacrificed, and the tumors were removed and weighed for use
in histology.

Results
Notch-1 and Notch-4 expression in breast cancers. We
examined normal breast compared with hyperplastic, early, and
late neoplastic lesions by immunohistochemistry (see Supplementary Data and Supplementary Table S1 for details). All 41
infiltrating carcinomas (27 ductal and 14 lobular) were positive
to some degree for Notch-1 and Notch-4, and at least one Notch
ligand. We defined cases as ‘‘low’’ (staining intensity 1–2+) or ‘‘high’’
(3+) expression. Twenty-four of 27 ductal infiltrating carcinomas
were Notch-1 high and 3 were Notch-1 low. Twenty-two of 27 were
Notch-4 high and 5 were Notch-4 low. Twenty-one were Jagged-1
high. Delta-1 expression showed lower staining intensity, resulting
in 21 Delta-1 low and 6 Delta-1 high. Eight of 14 lobular infiltrating
carcinomas were Notch-1 high and 6 were Notch-1 low. Thirteen of
14 tumors in this group were Notch-4 high. Nine tumors were
Jagged-1 high and 5 were Notch-4 low, whereas for Delta-1 these
proportions were reversed.
Breast cancer cell lines have variable levels of CBF-1
transcriptional activity. Consistent with the literature (16),
Western blot analysis for total Notch-1 with a COOH-terminal
antibody showed that several breast cancer cell lines, but also
nontransformed HMECs proliferating in culture, had strong Notch1 expression (Fig. 1A). Notch-4 was also expressed in HMEC and
breast cancer cells. Breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB231,
T47D ERa subclone C42 (23), and T47D ERa+ subclone A18 (23)
and SKBR3 expressed variable steady-state levels of Notch-1 and
Notch-4 proteins. However, when we examined basal CBF1–dependent reporter activity, there was no obvious correlation
between steady-state levels of Notch proteins and Renillanormalized transcriptional activity, suggesting that factors other

than expression levels of Notch-1 and Notch-4 regulate Notchdependent reporter activity. ERa , Her2/Neu nonoverexpressing
lines MDA-MB231 and T47D:C42 consistently had much higher
activity than ERa+ lines MCF-7, T47D:A18, Her2/Neu overexpressing line SKBR3, or HMEC (Fig. 1B). This suggested that there may
be an inverse correlation between ERa or Her2/Neu and Notch
activity in breast cancer cell lines. Therefore, we examined the role
of estrogen in regulating Notch activity. The cross-talk between
Her2/Neu and Notch will be described elsewhere.8
Estradiol inhibits Notch activity and selective ER modulators block its effect. Treatment of ERa+ T47D:A18 cells with
10 9 mol/L estradiol in charcoal-stripped medium strongly
up-regulated Notch-1 protein (Fig. 1C) but barely affected it in
ERa T47D:C42 cells. Real-time RT-PCR experiments indicated
that these effects are not mediated by transcriptional regulation
(data not shown). In two different ERa+ lines, T47D:A18 and MCF7, treatment with 10 9 mol/L estradiol inhibited Notch-4
expression compared with vehicle (Fig. 1D). These effects were
antagonized by 1 Amol/L 4-OH-TAM. Because Notch-4 is a
transcriptional target of Notch-1 (18), we hypothesized that
estradiol inhibits Notch transcriptional activity while accumulating

uncleaved Notch-1 protein. Reporter experiments supported this
hypothesis. In T47D:A18 cells stably expressing a CBF-1 reporter,
estradiol consistently and significantly (P = 0.0025) inhibited
reporter activity, whereas pure antagonist fulvestrant or selective
ER modulators (SERM) tamoxifen or raloxifene did not (Fig. 2A).
Virtually identical results were obtained in MCF-7 cells transiently
transfected with the same reporter (Fig. 2B). We tested Notch
activation under physiologic conditions by coculturing MCF-7 cells
with mouse OP9 stromal cells expressing Notch ligand Delta-1 or
GFP (control). In real-time RT-PCR experiments, Delta-1–expressing stromal cells dramatically increased the expression of Notch
target gene HEY1 compared with control stromal cells. Treatment
with estradiol for 24 h nearly abolished this effect (P < 0.001;
Fig. 2C). Two-hour treatment had a much more modest effect,
suggesting that the effect of estradiol on HEY1 expression is
indirect. This indicated that estrogen suppresses Notch-1–dependent transcription in ERa+ cells even as it increases the amount of
Notch-1 protein. Therefore, we determined nuclear levels of cleaved
Notch-1 by using a full-length Notch-1 construct tagged at the
COOH terminus with Renilla luciferase (20), which requires a
ligand for activation. Figure 2D shows that estradiol significantly
decreases the ratio between nuclear and total Notch-1/Renilla
luciferase activity in both T47D:A18 (P = 0.01) and MCF-7 cells
(P = 0.002). We used confocal immunofluorescence to morphologically define the cellular distribution of Notch-1 in T47D:A18 and
MCF-7 cells. Figure 3A shows that in both MCF-7 and T47D:A18

Estrogen Modulates Notch Activity

cells under estrogen deprivation conditions in charcoal-stripped
medium, Notch-1 could be detected as a punctate signal distributed to cytoplasm and nucleus. Estradiol caused a remarkable
redistribution of the signal, which was relatively depleted from the
nucleus and showed striking cell membrane accumulation with a
‘‘chicken-wire’’ pattern. 4-OH-TAM treatment produced a pattern
similar to control. To further examine the effects of estradiol on
Notch-1 cellular distribution, we conducted cell surface biotinylation experiments (Fig. 3B). Cells were treated with vehicle or
estradiol for 48 h, a time before significant accumulation of Notch1 can be detected. Surface proteins were biotinylated with a cellimpermeable reagent, cells were lysed, and equal amounts of total
cellular proteins were precipitated with conjugated streptavidin
and analyzed by Western blotting for total Notch-1. Under these
conditions, estradiol dramatically increased the amount of
biotinylated (and thus cell surface associated) Notch-1 compared
with vehicle. This difference was much larger than the difference in
total amounts of Notch-1 as detected by Western blotting on the
same lysates. These data indicated that estrogen-treated cells
accumulate inactive Notch at the cell surface.
Overall, our data indicate that estrogen inhibits Notch-1 activity at
least in part by altering the cellular distribution of Notch-1. Thus, we
examined whether estradiol affects the cleavage rate of Notch-1 by
g-secretase using a quantitative assay (24) in which a Notch-1 NTM
construct tagged with GAL4/VP16 is transiently cotransfected with

an upstream activation sequence (UAS) reporter plasmid. Activation
of the UAS reporter by GAL4/VP16 depends on cleavage of the Notch
chimeric protein by g-secretase but does not require a ligand. Figure
3C shows that estradiol significantly inhibited Notch activation as
measured by this assay (P < 0.01). Fulvestrant modestly stimulated
Notch activation, whereas 4-OH-TAM had no significant effects by
itself. Both fulvestrant and 4-OH-TAM abrogated estrogen-mediated
inhibition. Thus, the activation and nuclear localization of either
ligand-dependent or ligand-independent Notch-1 constructs is
inhibited by estradiol. These data suggest that estrogen affects a
step of Notch activation distal to ligand binding and directly or
indirectly inhibits Notch cleavage. This effect is most likely an
indirect consequence of the cellular redistribution of Notch caused
by estrogen because cleavage of a h-amyloid substrate under
identical assay conditions was not significantly affected by estrogen
in either MCF-7 or T47D:A18 cells (Fig. 3D).
Notch-1 and Notch-4 stimulate proliferation and invasion in
breast cancer cell lines. Our data suggested a model in which
estrogen inhibits Notch via ERa. ERa breast cancer cell lines have
unfettered Notch activity and are presumably Notch dependent.
ERa+ breast cancer cell lines increase Notch activity when estrogen
deprived or when estrogen is antagonized by SERMs, and may
become more dependent on Notch under these conditions. We
tested this hypothesis by siRNA knockdown. In ERa MDA-MB231
cells, knockdown of Notch-1 or Notch-4 had strong antiproliferative

to normalize for transfection efficiency. 4-OH-TAM (10 6 mol/L), raloxifene (10 6 mol/L), and

48 h with hormones. Twenty-four hours before lysing the cells, 25 Amol/L lactacystin was added to inhibit Notch degradation. The experiment was repeated at
least thrice. Columns, mean; bars, SD. D, T47D:A18 and MCF-7 cells were grown in charcoal-stripped medium for 3 d and then transfected by electroporation with

effects (Fig. 4A). Notch-1 knockdown also down-regulated Notch-4,
whereas Notch-4 silencing had no effect on Notch-1, indicating that
Notch-1 is upstream of Notch-4 in these cells. Additionally, Notch-1
or Notch-4 knockdown significantly inhibited Matrigel invasion
(Supplementary Fig. S2A), whereas transfecting Notch-1IC into
MCF-7 cells up-regulated Notch-4, increased proliferation, and
induced Matrigel invasion (Supplementary Fig. S2B–D). These data
suggest that Notch-4 either is necessary for the effects of Notch-1 in
these cells or has oncogenic downstream pathways independent of
Notch-1. Similarly, in ERa+ T47D:A18 cells, siRNA knockdown of
either Notch-1 or Notch-4 caused significant growth inhibition,
which was enhanced by addition of 4-OH-TAM (0.37–25 Amol/L;
Fig. 4B).
Inhibition of Notch signaling causes G2 growth arrest in
breast cancer cells with decreased cyclin A and B levels and
induction of NOXA. We investigated the mechanism of the
apparent antiproliferative effects of Notch knockdown. In MDAMB231 cells, RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of Notch-1 or
Notch-4 caused accumulation of cells in G2-M and a corresponding
decrease of cells in G1 and S (Supplementary Fig. S3A). An increase
in the sub-G1 fraction, indicative of cell death, was seen at 48 h.

silencing, suggesting cell cycle arrest in G2, before mitosis
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). S-phase transcription factor E2F-1,
which up-regulates its own transcription (25), accumulated after
Notch-1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S3C), suggesting a
deregulated S-G2 transition. With both Notch-1 and Notch-4 RNAi,
G2 accumulation was maximal at 24 h, and at 48 h, it was replaced
by an increased fraction of cells in sub-G1 (Supplementary
Fig. S3D). G2-M accumulation followed by death was described
on Notch inhibition in mesothelioma (26), melanoma (27), and
Kaposi sarcoma (28). We therefore explored the effects of Notch-1
siRNA on the expression of cyclins, some of which were described
as Notch targets. RNase protection data (Fig. 4C) indicated that
Notch-1 knockdown in MDA-MB231 cells decreases mRNA
expression for cyclins A and B1, but not C, or D. Western blot
data confirmed these findings. Figure 4D (left) shows that Notch-1
knockdown in MDA-MB231 caused a striking decrease in steadystate levels of cyclins A and B1. The ratio between nuclear and
cytoplasmic levels of cyclin B1 was not affected (data not shown).
At the same time, NOXA was markedly up-regulated. Consistent
with MDA-MB231 data, in ERa+ T47D:A18 cells, Notch-1 siRNA
treatment for 72 h caused strong down-regulation of cyclin A,
a more modest decrease of cyclin B1, and NOXA accumulation

Estrogen Modulates Notch Activity

(Fig. 4D, right). Notch-1IC overexpression inhibits p53-induced
NOXA accumulation in MCF-10A cells (16). Our data indicate that
endogenous Notch-1 suppresses NOXA expression even in p53mutant MDA-MB231 cells. Cyclin A/cyclin-dependent kinase 2
(cdk2) phosphorylates and inactivates E2F-1/DP complexes at the
end of S phase. Failure of cyclin A/cdk2 to inactivate E2F results in
inappropriately persistent E2F activity (29), which induces NOXA
(30), causing apoptosis. Thus, loss of cyclin A may contribute to
NOXA expression via E2F-1.
Inhibition of ;-secretase has antineoplastic effects on breast
cancer cell lines. We investigated whether the effects of Notch
knockdown can be replicated by nonselective, pharmacologic
inhibition of Notch activation with g-secretase inhibitors. We used
a potent, commercially available compound, GSI, which inhibits
Notch cleavage and has antineoplastic activity in melanoma (27)
and Kaposi sarcoma cells (28). We validated the activity, specificity,
and dose response of this GSI in our cell lines (see Supplementary
Data and Supplementary Fig. S4A–D). In T47D:A18 cells grown in
complete medium, GSI had strong growth-inhibitory effects, with

an IC50 of f0.84 Amol/L (Fig. 5A). When we combined GSI at
sub-IC50 concentrations (0.2 and 0.4 Amol/L) with 4-OH-TAM
(0–12.5 Amol/L), the combination caused significantly more growth
inhibition after 48-h treatment than either drug alone, particularly
at very low (0.8–1.5 Amol/L) 4-OH-TAM concentrations (Fig. 5B).
Isobologram analysis (data not shown) indicated that the effect
was additive. The IC50 of 4-OH-TAM without GSI was 11 Amol/L.
Together with RNAi data, these findings strongly support the
hypothesis that genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of Notch
signaling has antineoplastic effects on some breast cancer cells.
We then investigated whether GSI affects the same targets we
identified using Notch-1 siRNA. GSI treatment of MDA-MB231 cells
at 1 Amol/L (IC50, 1.23 Amol/L; Supplementary Fig. S4C) had
identical effects as Notch-1 siRNA on cyclin A and B1 levels and
caused NOXA induction (Fig. 5C). We used T47D:A18 cells to
determine if these putative Notch targets are modulated by a
combined treatment with a SERM and GSI. In T47D:A18 cells,
either 4-OH-TAM or a subtoxic concentration of GSI alone
(0.4 Amol/L; IC50, 0.84 Amol/L) reduced cyclins A and B1

that RNAi silencing of Notch-1 in MDA-MB231 cells also down-regulated Notch-4, whereas nearly quantitative silencing of Notch-4 by RNAi had no effects on Notch-1.
Control was a siRNA with no homology with known mammalian genes. Right, RNAi silencing of Notch-1 (which also affects Notch-4) or silencing of Notch-4 alone

data point symbols. B, silencing of either Notch-1 or Notch-4 in T47D:A18 cells inhibits proliferation and potentiates the effects of 4-OH-TAM. T47D:A18 cells were
transfected with siRNA to Notch-1 or Notch-4 or scrambled control siRNA. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (8,000 per well)
and treated with decreasing concentrations of 4-OH-TAM (25–0.38 Amol/L) in 0.5% ethanol for 24 h. At the end of treatment, cytotoxicity was evaluated by crystal
violet staining. C, RNase protection assay showing that mRNA levels for cyclins A and B1 were reduced in MDA-MB231 cells transfected with Notch-1 siRNA.

at a concentration as low as 0.8 Amol/L
caused significant growth inhibition in
T47D:A18 cells in the presence of 0.2 and
0.4 Amol/L of GSI (IC50 of GSI alone,
0.84 Amol/L). The IC50 of 4-OH-TAM alone
in this assay is 11 Amol/L. C, Western

decreased cyclins A and B1 and induced
NOXA. D, Western blots of T47D:A18 cells
treated for 48 h, showing that 0.4 Amol/L
GSI alone, 10 Amol/L 4-OH-TAM alone,
or a combination inhibited expression of
cyclins A and B1. Only the combination
caused induction of NOXA at 24 h.

(Fig. 5D). The effects of 4-OH-TAM are most likely mediated by
Notch-independent mechanisms because 4-OH-TAM does not
inhibit Notch activity. 4-OH-TAM suppresses cyclin A transcription
via p38 (31). Combined treatment of these cells with 4-OH-TAM
and GSI completely abolished expression of cyclins A and B.
Interestingly, only the combination caused induction of NOXA.
Dose-dependent, additive, or synergistic effects on cyclin A and B
expression were observed at 1, 2, and 5 Amol/L of 4-OH-TAM
(Supplementary Fig. S5). However, NOXA induction was only
observed at 4-OH-TAM concentrations >5 Amol/L. Unlike Notch-1
siRNA, GSI alone did not induce NOXA. It should be noted that for
these experiments we used a subtoxic concentration of GSI for
48 h to avoid masking any synergistic effects with 4-OH-TAM,
whereas siRNA treatment was continued for 72 h. This suggests
that near-complete and/or prolonged inhibition of Notch signaling
is necessary for NOXA induction in these cells. The combination
used in Fig. 5D (0.4 Amol/L GSI and 10 Amol/L 4-OH-TAM) caused
f50% growth inhibition. These data also suggest that loss of cyclin
A is not sufficient to cause NOXA induction in T47D:A18 cells. This
may be due to the fact that these cells proliferate slowly due to
the cytostatic effects of 4-OH-TAM or to additional cyclin
A–independent mechanisms of NOXA suppression by Notch in
these cells.
In vivo treatment with a g-secretase inhibitor blocks the
growth of MDA-MB231 xenografts and causes regression of
T47D:A18 xenografts in combination with tamoxifen. Our
in vitro data support a model in which ERa breast cancer cells
have high Notch activity and are dependent on Notch signaling for
growth, survival, and possibly invasion, whereas ERa+ cells have
lower basal Notch activity but are highly sensitive to a combination
including a Notch inhibitor and a SERM. We tested this model
in vivo in established tumor xenograft models. Figure 6A shows

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

that treatment with GSI at 1.2 mg/kg s.c. near the xenografts every
other day caused virtually complete growth arrest in established
MDA-MB231 tumors compared with DMSO vehicle (P < 0.002 at
each time point after day 4). This dose of GSI has similar effects on
melanoma xenografts (27). Given a body weight of 25 g, and
assuming 100% bioavailability, free diffusion throughout body
fluids, no metabolism, and no excretion, the maximum theoretical
extracellular fluid concentration of GSI at this dose would be in the
order of 2.5 Amol/L. We did inject the drug s.c. near the tumor area
to minimize the effects of degradation and excretion because GSI is
a tripeptide that is likely rapidly eliminated. However, we have no
reason to believe that the drug remained unabsorbed in the tumor
area. Under these conditions, average in vivo concentrations are
most likely in the order of what we used in cell culture or lower. No
overt toxicity of GSI was observed at these doses for 10 days, and
mouse weight was not significantly affected. The nonstatistically
significant increase in average volume at this time may have been
due to edema and hemorrhage (see below). We obtained virtually
identical data with a chemically unrelated GSI, LY411,575.9 In
established T47D:A18 xenografts receiving a menopausal level of
estradiol, GSI alone (1.2 mg/kg every other day) or tamoxifen alone
blocked further tumor progression with similar efficacy. However,
when given in combination, the two agents caused significant
regression of established tumors (P < 0.05 by ANOVA corrected for
multiple comparison for the combined treatment compared with
each agent alone and for each agent alone compared with vehicle
controls; Fig. 6B). Histologically, MDA-MB231 tumors at 10 days
were mostly necrotic and hemorrhagic (Fig. 6C). In established
T47D:A18 tumors, GSI either alone or with tamoxifen caused

extensive cell death with nuclear pyknosis. Hemorrhage and edema
were also visible in GSI-treated T47D:A18 tumors (Fig. 6D),
suggesting an effect on endothelial cells, where Notch-1 and
Notch-4 are known to play active roles (32–34).

Discussion
High expression of Notch-1 and/or Jagged-1 has negative
prognostic significance in breast cancer (14, 15), and Notch-1 can
transform HMECs (16). Our data confirm that Notch-1 and Notch-4
are commonly coexpressed in infiltrating breast cancers of ductal
and lobular histologies, which also express Notch ligands Jagged-1
and Delta-1. However, our observations on breast cancer cell lines
suggest that there may not be a simple correlation between protein
levels of Notch receptor and ligands and Notch pathway activity
level. Our data suggest that estrogen inhibits Notch signaling
through an ERa-dependent effect, which is at least in part mediated
by inhibition of Notch cleavage by g-secretase. Inhibition of Notch
activation by estrogen is observed under physiologic, ligandinduced Notch activation conditions, but it is independent of
Notch ligands. Estradiol did not affect expression of Jagged-1, the
most abundant Notch ligand in these cells (data not shown). The
membrane accumulation of uncleaved Notch-1 in estrogen-treated
cells suggests an effect on Notch intracellular trafficking or
induction of other g-secretase substrates that could compete with
Notch-1. In a previous report, estrogen was suggested to activate
Notch signaling in MCF-7 cells (35). However, this conclusion was
based exclusively on reporter assays, which did not seem to contain
transfection efficiency internal controls. Because estrogen increases
transfection efficiency in estrogen-dependent cell lines, these results
may reflect estrogen-induced increased reporter plasmid transfection. Notch-1 induces Notch-4 expression in breast cancer cell lines,
similar to BJ fibroblasts (18). In MDA-MB231 and T47D:A18 cells,
Notch-4 seems to contribute to the pro-oncogenic effects of Notch1. Whether Notch-4 can mediate these effects in the absence of
Notch-1 remains to be determined. Notch-4 is a well-known
mammary oncogene in mice, but before this report, its expression
in human breast cancer had not been carefully analyzed. To test the
hypothesis that Notch-4 may be relevant to human breast cancer
biology, we studied an additional, prospectively collected group of
clinical specimens (n = 31) that did not overlap with our original
sample population. We correlated expression of Notch-1 and Notch4 with known prognostic factors in breast cancer, including node
status, tumor size, age, ER status, lymphovascular invasion, Her2/
Neu status, and Ki67. Logistic regression analysis revealed that a
high proliferation index (Ki67) was significantly associated with
high Notch-4 receptor expression (P < 0.02; Supplementary Fig. S6).
These data support the hypothesis that Notch-4 may have an
important biological role in breast cancer and may be a biomarker
and/or a candidate therapeutic target.
Our data suggest a model in which in ERa+ breast epithelial cells
Notch-1 is a hormone-modulated signal that controls proliferation
and survival. In ERa+ neoplastic cells, estrogen deprivation, loss of
ERa, or treatment with antiestrogens reactivates Notch-1 and
induces Notch-4, stimulating proliferation, survival, and invasion.
In normal human breasts, ERa+ cells are nonproliferative, unlike
ERa cells (36). Our findings are consistent with this model. Clarke
and colleagues (37) propose that side population (SP) cells from
normal human breast are enriched in ERa and express Notch
positive regulator Msi-1, suggesting active Notch signaling in an
ERa+ background. We do not know how our findings in

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

transformed cells relate to normal SP cells. However, the effects
of Notch-1 siRNA in ERa+ T47D:A18 cells suggest that even low
levels of Notch signaling may have important physiologic
consequences.
Notch-1IC expression in murine T cells (38) or mammary
epithelial cells (39) induces c-Myc. In coculture assays, Delta-1
strongly induced c-Myc in T47D:A18 cells (data not shown).
However, Notch-1 silencing by siRNA in these cells only modestly
decreased c-Myc, and GSI only decreased it at 2 Amol/L (>2 IC50;
Supplementary Fig. S7). In MDA-MB231 cells, even at 2 Amol/L, we
could not observe inhibition of c-Myc expression (Supplementary
Fig. S7). This suggests that although c-Myc is a transcriptional
target of Notch-1 in human breast cancer cell lines, Notch is only
one of the factors that regulate its expression. Another putative
Notch-1 target is cyclin D1 (40). We did not observe cyclin D1
down-regulation on Notch-1 knockdown in our cells. This does not
necessarily mean that Notch-1 does not regulate the cyclin D1
promoter, as we did observe cyclin D1 mRNA accumulation in cells
transfected with Notch-1IC (data not shown). The effects of Notch-1
silencing in our cells may be masked by redundant pathways that
regulate cyclin D1 expression.
Our study reveals that Notch signaling controls expression of
cyclins A and B1 in breast cancer cells. Cyclin A overexpression has
been described as a negative prognostic marker in breast cancer
(41). Drosophila Notch is required for cyclin A expression in the
developing eye (42). Analysis of the human cyclin A promoter
revealed two putative CBF-1–responsive elements in the first intron
(nucleotides 82637 and 82655 of minus strand, locus AC079341) as
well as two putative NF-nB–responsive elements at 2113
nucleotides from the transcriptional start (nucleotide 85677 of
minus strand, locus AC079341) and in the first intron (nucleotide
82632 of minus strand, locus AC079341). Up-regulation of cyclin B1
by Notch had not been described to our knowledge. The mechanism
may be direct or indirect, but we have identified putative CBF-1–
binding elements (TGGGAA) at 616 and 19 nucleotides from the
transcriptional start (nucleotides 496 and 1093 of plus strand, locus
AY338491) and in the first intron (nucleotide 1570 of plus strand,
locus AY338491) of the human cyclin B1 promoter.
Our data support a role for NOXA suppression in Notchmediated survival effects. Inhibition of g-secretase in melanoma
cells causes apoptosis by induction of NOXA (27). Overexpression
of Notch-1 in MCF-10A cells suppresses NOXA induction by
chemotherapy agents (16). Our data indicate that both RNAi
knockdown of Notch-1 and g-secretase inhibition induce NOXA in
breast cancer cells. NOXA up-regulation in response to Notch
inhibition may be mediated by p53 (16, 43). However, here we
describe NOXA induction on Notch inhibition in two cell lines with
mutant p53. Additional mechanisms that may mediate NOXA upregulation include uncontrolled E2F-1 activation (44), possibly
consequence of cyclin A loss, or activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinase (45, 46), which is inhibited by Notch-1 via JNP-1 (47).
Taken together, our clinical, in vitro, and in vivo data support the
notion that inhibition of Notch signaling may be an attractive
therapeutic strategy in breast cancer. Our data also indicate that
the optimal use of Notch inhibitors depends on the ER status of the
tumor. GSIs may be useful, possibly in combination with chemotherapy, in the poor-prognosis ‘‘triple-negative’’ cancers that are
ERa/progesterone receptor negative and do not overexpress Her2/
Neu. Additionally, our data indicate that inhibition of Notch
signaling in combination with an antiestrogen may be a promising
therapeutic strategy for ERa+ breast cancers.
