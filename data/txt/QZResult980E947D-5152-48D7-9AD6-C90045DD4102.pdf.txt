Abstract
Immunotherapy is a promising treatment for liver cancer. Here, we tested the
ability of the attenuated hepatocellular carcinoma-specific Listeria vaccine (LmddMPFG) to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a mouse model. Immunization with
the vaccine caused a strong anti-tumor response, especially in mice reinfused with
dendritic cells (DCs). In mice that were also administered DCs, tumor suppression was
accompanied by the strongest cytotoxic T lymphocyte response of all treatment groups
and by induced differentiation of CD4+ T cells, especially Th17 cells. Additionally,
the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine caused maturation of DCs in vitro. We demonstrated the
synergistic effect of TLR4 and NLRP3 or NOD1 signaling pathways in LM-induced DC
activation. These results suggest that the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine is a feasible strategy
for preventing HCC.

Introduction

a result, tumor vaccines, which can both induce specific
cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) responses to tumor cells
and change tumor microenvironments [11], have become
a safe and effective anti-tumor treatment after surgery,
radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
As an intracellular parasite, Listeria monocytogenes
(Lm) is generally considered to be an excellent vector
for inducing protective cellular immune responses in
tumor immunotherapy [12]. After infection, Lm occurs
in the cytoplasm of antigen-presenting cells such as
macrophages and dendritic cells, and then induces both
a CD8+ T cell and CD4+ T cell response by presenting
foreign antigens with major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class I and MHC class II molecules efficiently
[11,13]. At the same time, the safety of using Lm is also
a critical consideration. Lmdd (Listeria monocytogenes
Δdal Δdat) is a highly attenuated vaccine vector, in
which the alanine racemase (dal) and D-amino acid
aminotransferase (dat) genes have been deleted. Lmdd
exhibits minimal toxicity without D-alanine (D-ala)
synthesis capacity but modest immunogenicity [14,
15]. In our previous study, a recombinant HCC vaccine

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most
common type of primary human liver cancer, which is
the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. It is an
advanced stage of severe viral hepatitis B or C infection
(HBV or HCV) as well as alcoholic liver disease [1, 2].
Unfortunately, many patients with early stage diseases are
asymptomatic, and advanced HCC patients barely respond
to regular chemotherapy or radiotherapy. As a result, HCC
is frequently diagnosed late and requires costly surgical
resection or transplantation [3, 4]. While in medium- and
late-stage cancer patients, the rate of surgical resection
is usually very low (5% to 10%), and the efficacy is
compromised by recurrence and metastasis as well [5-7].
Thus, there is an urgent need to explore more effective
methods to prevent or treat HCC.
In recent years, research efforts began to focus on
immunotherapy in HCC treatment [4, 8]. Studies have
shown that immune function is significantly weakened in
HCC patients, mainly due to defective T cell responses
and functional defects in antigen presentation [9, 10]. As

Lmdd-MPFG (LM) was constructed based on Lmdd. This
LM recombinant epitope expresses the fusion peptide
MPFG (multiple peptide fusing genes), a combination
of HCC-related human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A0201
epitopes, full-length hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein
(HBc), HBV-X protein (HBx)52-60, HBx140-148,
alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) 158-166 and melanoma antigen
gene-A (MAGE)271-279, and has proven to be effective in
inducing strong and speciﬁc anti-tumor cellular immunity
to HCC [16].
Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most powerful
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and known as important
messengers between the innate and the adaptive immune
systems [17]. Recent studies show that DCs also play a
significant role in tumor immunotherapy. DCs sensitized
by tumor-associated antigens or antigenic peptides in vitro
can induce anti-tumor immune response-specific CTL after
transfusion or vaccination in tumor-bearing hosts [18, 19].
It has been reported that Lm can promote the maturation
and antigen presentation of DCs and thus effectively
stimulate the activation of effector T cells to kill tumor
cells[20].On the other hand, DCs are required for Lm
dissemination and proliferation during spleen infection
[21,22]. However, the Lm vaccine utilizes DCs to enhance
antitumor immunity, and the probable mechanisms have
not been elucidated.
Here, we precisely confirmed that Lmdd-MPFG
can be used as an antigen-loading vector to target and
promote DC maturation, inducing differentiation of T
cell subsets and specific T cell antitumor responses. Our
findings revealed that this attenuated Listeria vaccine
enhances antitumor activity and DC maturation mainly
by modulating CD4+ T cells, especially Th17 cells.
Furthermore, we postulated the pattern recognition
receptors (PRRs) might be key components in the
identification and presentation of Lm by DCs. Several
studies have confirmed that Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
and NACHT-LRRs (NLRs) act as important sensors for
the immune system and are involved in innate effector
mechanisms and activation of adaptive immunity [23-25].
This study showed the relevance of interactions between
TLR4, NLRP3 and NOD1 in LM-induced DC maturation
and anti-tumor responses, which help us understand the
immune regulatory mechanisms involved in LM vaccinerelated tumor immunotherapy.

(LM), and heat-killed LM (LM-HK) or WT (WT-HK)
at a MOI of 20. Twenty-four hours after stimulation,
expression levels of the DC surface functional markers
CD80 and CD86 were detected by flow cytometry,
gated on CD11c (Fig. 1A). The percentage of positively
stained CD80 and CD86 cells and their mean fluorescence
densities are depicted in histograms shown in Fig. 1B.
We found that expression of CD80 and CD86 in DCs was
significantly increased in LPS- and LM- stimulated DC
groups compared to the expression in the control group.
There was no significant difference in CD80 or CD86
expression between Lmdd-MPFG and WT Lm-treated
groups.
At the same time, cell culture supernatants for each
group were collected after stimulation, and secretion
of several cytokines was tested by ELISA (Fig. 1C).
Secretion of the cytokines IL-1β and IL-12p70, which are
secreted by immunomodulatory DCs, was increased after
stimulation, especially the secretion of IL-1β. Although the
overall secretion of IFN-γ is low, significant differences
were observed. TNF-α and IFN-γ secretion was increased
in LPS- and LM-infected DCs compared to the control
group.
To explore whether DCs could induce or enhance
specific T cell responses via LM stimulation especially
with the HLA-A2.1 limiting condition, DCs were
generated from the HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice, compared
to normal mice, cultured with allogeneic naive splenocytes
for 4 days. Then, T-cell proliferation was measured by
incorporation of radioactive thymidine during the last 16
hours (Fig. 1D). The result showed that DCs infected with
the attenuated strain induced proliferation of allogeneic T
cells from HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice compared to control
DCs and that T cells showed stronger reactivity to LM
when co-cultured with DCs. Additionally, in the IFN-γ
ELISPOT assay (Fig. 1E), significantly more spot-forming
colonies were observed in the Lmdd-MPFG group than in
the controls.
In accordance with these findings, we confirmed
that the ability of Lmdd-MPFG to induce DC maturation
was not impaired by foreign transgenes and that the
modified Lm gene was comparable to wild type Lm. We
also showed that Lmdd-MPFG can induce specific T-cell
responses in HLA-A2.1 mice.

NLRs and TLRs and signaling pathways in LMactivated DC maturation

Results

To investigate relevant receptors involved in LMinduced DC activation, the mRNA expression levels of
possible NLRs (Fig. 2A) and TLRs (Fig. 2B) in each
DC-treated group (control, LPS, LM, and LM-HK)
were detected. Real-time PCR results showed increased
expression of NLRs and TLRs in LM-infected groups.
An increase in NLRP3 expression was detected only in

To observe DC activation after infection by LmddMPFG, mouse BMDCs were extracted and purified from
HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice. Immature DCs were collected

the LPS-treated group, suggesting a certain connection
between NLRP3 and TLR4. Previous studies have shown
that the NOD1/NOD2 pathway has a synergistic effect
with NLRP3, so we further detected the protein expression
levels of NOD1, NLRP3 and TLR in treated DCs by
western blotting, (Fig. 2C, and 2D). Western blot analyses
revealed significant up-regulation of NOD1, NLRP3 and
TLR4 in LM-infected DCs and LPS-stimulated DCs
compared to the control group.
Emerging lines of evidence suggest that TLRand NLR-mediated priming signals are required in the
Lm infection process [51]. To explore the signaling
pathways downstream of the above receptors, we detected
the expression levels of NF-kB, MAPK, IKK-α/β and

caspase-1 in LM-infected DCs. The histogram in Fig. 2E
shows the distribution of expression levels in each group
compared to internal controls (Fig. 2F). As shown in the
western blotting assay, DCs infected with LM showed
effective activation of the NF-kB / pNF-kB signaling
pathway, as well as caspase-1 expression. On the other
hand, stimulation with LM did not lead to activation of the
MAPK or IKK-α/βpathways.

monocytogenes, LPS, and a control (no stimulation), for its potency to promote maturation of BMDCs. DCs were harvested 24 hours after
infection with LM (at a MOI of 20), and the expressions of CD80 and CD86 were assessed by flow cytometry, and the peak with gray filled

measurements of IL-12p70 and TNF-α by ELISA (C). DCs from HLA A2.1+ or HLA A2.1– donors were generated and infected as above,
followed by co-culture with allogeneic SPCs for 4 days. Proliferation (D) was measured by 3H thymidine incorporation, and stimulation
indices (SI) were calculated as described. CD8+ TIL function was analyzed by an IFN-γ ELISPOT assay (E). Standard assays were then
developed according to the kit manual, and the numbers of spot-forming colonies were calculated. Results were collected from at least three
independent experiments. Individual data and mean values are shown. Statistically significant differences are indicated as determined by

and TLR4 signaling pathways in the LM-induced DCactivation process, we collected immature DCs and
subjected them to different treatments (control, MDP,
LPS+MSU, MSU, MDP+MSU, SiNLRP3). NLRP3
expression was silenced in immature DCs with or without
LM infection. After stimulation by corresponding agonists
(LPS, TLR4 agonist; MDP, NOD1/2 agonist; and MSU,
NLRP3 agonist) for 6-8 h, DC functional phenotypes
were detected by flow cytometry (Fig. 3A and 3B). We
found that both the CD80 and CD86 expression levels
were down-regulated in SiNLRP3 DCs compared to the
control, which indicated an important role for NLRP3 in
DC activation. Without LM stimulation, CD80 and CD86
levels were increased in the MSU-treated group, and a
higher expression occurred with MSU treatment combined
with LPS and MDP. More significant changes were
observed in the LM-stimulated groups; the combination
of agonists led to significant up-regulation in LM-induced
DC maturation.
Further, after stimulation by agonists, we detected
the expression of cytokines in the supernatants of
each group by ELISA (Fig. 3C). The results indicated
significantly higher secretions of IL-12p70, IL-1β, TNF-α,
and IFN-γ in the LM treatment groups compared to those
not treated with LM. Additionally, the secretion levels
of these cytokines were much greater after LPS+MSU
stimulations but were decreased in the SiNLRP3 group.
Finally, we examined the protein expression of
these receptors in cells of each group by western blot
analysis. As shown in Fig. 3D, in LM-infected groups, the
expression of NOD1, NLRP3 and TLR4 were increased
in DCs after LPS+MSU treatment but decreased in the
SiNLRP3 group compared to the control group. We
further investigated the signaling pathway and found that
the LPS+MSU and MDP+MSU stimulations induced
a significant activation of the NF-kB pathway and of
caspase-1 (Fig. 3E). These data confirmed the essential
function of NLRP3 and its crosstalk with NOD1/NOD2
and TLR4 in LM-induced DC presentation.

tumor suppression was more effective after intravenous
injection of DCs infected by LM. The survival rate of the
infected DC-reinfused mice was also the highest of all
the groups. The tumors were isolated from tumor-bearing
mice at day 45, and SPCs were extracted. Messenger
RNA and protein expression levels of NLR, TLR and
their downstream products were detected by real-time
PCR and western blot, as shown in Fig. 4D and Fig.
4F, respectively. Significant up-regulation of expression
of these molecules in the DC+LM group was observed.
Further, these SPCs were cultured for 24 h in vitro, then
the cell culture supernatants were collected, and secretion
of cytokines was measured by ELISA (Fig. 4E). Among
these cytokines, we found a particular increase in IFN-γ in
DC+LM immunized SPCs, which indicated that effective
tumor suppression could be achieved by combined DC and
LM function.

DCs are required for specific LM-mediated tumor
suppression in the spleen
To explore the DC-mediated effects under LM
infection in vivo, we obtained mouse spleen mononuclear
lymphocytes (SPCs) from each group as described above.
Functional DCs were detected by flow cytometry (Fig.
5A and Fig. 5B). In the DC+LM group, the percentage of
functional DCs in spleen was increased compared to the
percentages in other groups. In addition, we examined the
percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells induced in spleen
mononuclear lymphocytes. As indicated by the data shown
in Fig. 5C and Fig. 5D, in the spleen, either the percentage
of CD4+T or CD8+T cells was up-regulated, especially
CD4+ T cells. Thus, we speculate that DCs are necessary
to improve LM immunity in the spleen.

DCs enhance CTL responses against LM infection
and induce anti-tumor effects
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were isolated
from treated mice from each group. We first examined
the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations among the TILs
to evaluate the specific T-cell response. As shown in
Fig. 6A, the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were
significantly increased in vaccinated mice. Moreover, the
numbers of CD8+ T cells in combination therapy mice
were particularly increased compared to that of mice in
other immunization groups.
Next, to explore the regulatory functions of DCs
in the LM-immunized tumor microenvironment, CD4+
T cell differentiation was investigated. The percentages
of Th1, Th17 and Treg cells were determined by flow
cytometry and are shown in Fig. 6B, Fig. 6C and Fig. 6D,
respectively. The percentage of Treg cells was reduced in
the treated groups, Th1 and Th17 cell percentages were
increased in LM-treated mice, and the percentage of IL-

To establish tumor models, HLA-A2 Tg mice
were challenged with 5×104 Hepa1-6 or Hepa1-6MPFG (co-expressing HLA-A2 and MFPG) tumor
cells subcutaneously. Three to seven days after tumor
inoculation, the tumor-bearing mice were vaccinated with
PBS, Lmdd-MPFG, DC+LM or SiNLRP3DC+LM (n=5/
group) at weekly intervals. To evaluate the anti-tumor
effects of LM-infected DCs, we measured the tumor
sizes (Fig. 4A) and noted the growth rates of tumors
in each group (Fig. 4B). The survival rates were also
examined (Fig. 4C). Immunization with LM inhibited the
development and delayed the growth rates of tumors, and

TLR4 agonist; MDP, NOD1/2 agonist; MSU, NLRP3 agonist) for 6-8 h as described in the Materials and Methods section. Expression of
the functional DC molecules CD80 and CD86 was assessed by flow cytometry, and the peak with gray filled represents the control (A and

LM+DC mice. From these results, we concluded that DC
and LM vaccine combination therapy is effective to induce
anti-HCC responses.

peripheral blood DCs were obtained and infected by
LM, then total RNA samples were extracted, and NOD1,
NLRP3 and TLR4 expression levels were analyzed by
real-time PCR (Fig. 7D). The expression levels of these
receptors, especially of NLRP3, were decreased in the
LM-infected group. These data suggest that DCs and
NLRP3 might have an important function in the LM
vaccination-mediated suppression of HCC.

Dendritic cells also show functional defects in
HCC patients
Functional molecules expressed by DCs were
detected in the cancer and adjacent tissues of HCC
patients (Fig. 7A) as well as in peripheral blood of
patients or normal individuals (Fig. 7B). DCs in tumor
samples and in HCC patients’ peripheral blood showed
functional defects compared to those in noncancerous
tissues and samples from normal people. To verify the
deficiency of DCs in HCC, we further examined the
expression of CD11c in paraffin-embedded HCC samples
by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 7C). As shown,
weak cytoplasm staining and poor distribution of CD11c
was exhibited in HCC samples, while non-cancerous
tissues showed stronger expression, especially in areas of
inflammation.
Finally, in order to explore the role of LM and LMinduced responses in HCC patients and in normal people,

Discussion
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most
common and lethal malignant cancer worldwide, and its
incidence is increasing. The general etiologies of HCC are
hepatitis B and C viral infections and intensive alcohol
consumption [10, 26]. Current treatment options include
liver transplantation, surgical resection and local ablative
therapies. However, curative resection is not possible for
the many patients with poor hepatic reserve or multiple
tumors, and the recurrence rate remains high after tumor
resection [19, 27, 28]. There is a pressing need for novel
strategies to combat the development and recurrence
of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunotherapy
represents a potential therapeutic option for patients with

hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It could induce speciﬁc
self-regulation of the immune system to find and suppress
tumor cells.
Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is an intracellular
bacterium that has a natural capacity to elicit potent innate
and antigen-specific cellular immune responses. These
biological properties make L. monocytogenes a promising
platform for the development of anti-cancer therapy [2933]. Several preclinical studies have demonstrated the
safety and efficacy of attenuated L. monocytogenes strains
in presenting tumor-associated antigens to the immune
system for the clinical treatment of various cancers [3441]. Here, we focus on the features of an attenuated
hepatocellular carcinoma-specific Listeria vaccine LmddMPFG (LM) in the context of HCC immunotherapy.
The stable fusion of HCC-associated antigen genes
into the attenuated L. monocytogenes Lmdd makes it
potent and safe to induce speciﬁc antitumor cellular
immunity to HCC [16]. Studies have shown that wild type
(WT) Lm and the attenuated strains, when administered
intravenously in vivo, are rapidly taken up by APCs,
particularly DCs in the spleen and the liver [30, 31].
As the classical APC, DCs have been shown to play a
role in the containment of Lm during early stages of
infection [22]; moreover, they have been shown to be
essential for the priming of adaptive immune responses
to inhibit tumor development [21, 42-44]. In our study,
we observed the significance of LM infection in DC
activation and examined the functional phenotype of the
activated DCs. We found clear up-regulation of CD80 or
CD86 expression in DCs, as well as increased secretion
of cytokines from infected DCs. Therefore, LM is highly
effective in stimulating the maturation of DCs, which then
efficiently cross-present antigens to activate CD8+ T cells.
Studies have found that DCs in HCC patients have
an immature phenotype and are functionally defective; and
DCs are also considered important in many other cancer
prevention processes [45-48]. We therefore proposed a
strategy for HCC treatment by combining DCs and an LM
vaccine. In tumor-bearing mice, LM immunization delayed
the growth of tumors, and the tumor suppression was much
more evident after intravenous injection of DCs infected
by LM. The survival rate of DC-reinfused mice was also
the highest among all treatment groups. Moreover, DCs
function to induce specific CTL responses or to change
the expression profiles of CD4+ T cells to enhance
specific immunomodulatory effects [18, 22, 42, 49, 50].
Thus, in the in vivo study, we examined the function of
DCs in mouse spleens and detected CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells in both spleen and tumor tissues. We found that in
the group treated with a combination of the LM vaccine
and DCs, the percentage of functional DCs in spleen was
increased compared to other groups of immunized mice.
In the spleen, the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
were increased, especially of CD4+ T cells. Among the
TILs, the presence of CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells was
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

increased in vaccinated mice, and the growth of CD8+ T
cells in combination therapy mice was distinct from other
mice in single treatment groups. Furthermore, the CD4+ T
cell subsets among the TILs were examined to gain insight
into immune regulation in the tumor microenvironment.
We found that Treg cells were less abundant, while the
percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells were increased in LMtreated mice. Interestingly, the percentage of IL-17Aproducing T cells was significantly increased, especially
in LM and DC co-treated mice. From these results, we
conclude that DC and LM vaccine combination therapy is
a promising innovation for inducing anti-HCC responses
and that perhaps tumor suppression is mainly enhanced by
the production of T17 cells. But further understanding of
the mechanisms involved is needed to confirm the efficacy
of this treatment.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) serve
as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize
different but overlapping microbial components. They
provide the first line of protection against invading
microbial pathogens and are mediated by phagocytes
such as macrophages and DCs [51-53]. It is important to
explore the role of TLRs and NLRs in LM-induced DC
maturation. Many studies have shown that the NODlike receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3
(NLRP3) inﬂammasome is essential for activating DCs
in response to Lm infection and for inducing secretion of
the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18
by activating caspase-1.[54-57]. Furthermore, more and
more studies have found that the presence of interaction
between TLRs and NLRs could indicate an efficacious copresentation of antigen to initiate immune responses [5861]. Here, we investigated the role of related molecules
in LM-induced DC activation, particularly NLRP3, by
comparing LM- and LPS-treated mice. The results suggest
a certain relationship between NLRP3 and TLR4. Previous
studies have shown that the NOD1/NOD2 pathway has
a synergistic effect with NLRP3 [58]. Consistent with
those results, we also observed significant up-regulation
of NOD1, NLRP3 and TLR4 in DCs infected with LM
compared to DCs from the control group. Furthermore,
NLRP3 expression in immature DCs (with or without LM
infection) was silenced or stimulated by corresponding
agonists in vitro. Reduction of NLRP3 expression
inhibited DC maturation, while up-regulation of NLRs
or TLR4 resulted in the opposite. Thus, our findings
confirmed that NLRP3 induces effective activation of DCs
and that the interaction of NLRP3, NOD1/2 and TLR4
contributes to LM-induced DC antitumor activity mainly
by activating the NF-kB signaling pathway. Finally, the
results in human samples also verified the findings in
mice. Therefore, interactions between NLRP3, NOD1/2
and TLR4 might constitute a potential immune regulation
mechanism that accounts for the efficacy of DC and LM
combination therapy.

In conclusion, our results revealed the promising
therapeutic potential of combining DCs and the specific
HCC vaccine Lmdd-MPFG in HCC immunotherapy.
We also elucidated the mechanisms contributing to
the synergistic effect of the combined treatment. Due
to the absence of a systemic therapeutic treatment, this
combination immunotherapy represents a potentially
beneficial option for HCC patients. We also expect that
this DC therapeutic regimen can be applied to other types
of cancer that have been shown to respond to Lm-based
vaccines.

(BD Falcon) and washed with 5% FBS in RPMI 1640.
Red blood cells (RBC) were lysed by brief incubation in
0.15 M ammonium chloride solution, and cell debris was
removed by centrifugation using a lymphocyte isolation
sterile solution (Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS) as recommended
by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare Bio-Science AB).

Cell staining and flow cytometry
After stimulation, mouse BMDCs were harvested
and labeled with PE-Cy5.5–conjugated mAb against
CD11c (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA), PEconjugated anti-CD80 antibody (eBioscience, San Diego,
CA, USA), and APC-conjugated anti-CD86 antibody
(eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). Human TILs and
PMDCs were isolated and stained with anti-CD11c-FITC
and anti-CD80-PE. After isolation of TIL populations
and SPCs from tumor-bearing mice, cells were stained
with CD3-PE, CD4-FITC, CD8-APC, IL-1-PE, IL-17APE and Foxp3-PE (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA).
Antibodies and their respective isotypes, used as negative
controls for surface and intracellular staining, were all
purchased from BD PharMingen. The mouse regulatory
T cell staining kit (eBioscience) was used for intracellular
cell staining for Foxp3 according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Data were collected using a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA)
and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland,
OR, USA).

Materials and Methods
Preparation and stimulation of BMDCs
Mouse BMDCs were prepared as previously
described [16]. DCs were used for experiments after
7-8 d of culture, at which point CD11c expression was
analyzed by flow cytometry. The Listeria strain has
been described in detail previously. Bacterial strains
(Wild type Lm and Lmdd-MPFG) were cultured in BHI
medium and concentrations were determined during the
bacterial logarithmic growth phase (OD600=0.6-0.8).
Heat-inactivated bacteria (WT-HK and LM-HK) were
prepared by incubating at 80°C for 2 hours. Immature
DCs were infected by bacteria at a MOI of 20. After a
2-4 h infection, bacteria were removed by incubating DCs
in RPMI1640 containing 40 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma, St
Louis, MO, USA).
BMDCs were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml), MDP
(10 μg/ml), MSU (250 μg/ml), LPS and MSU together, or
MDP and MSU together for 6-8 h. LPS, MDP, MSU were
purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (Sigma, St Louis,
MO, USA). DCs were transfected with control NC siRNA
or siRNA to NLRP3, and the siRNA sequences were: NC:
sense: 5 ’-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3’, antisense:
3 ’-ACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAATT-5’; NALP3/
NLRP3: sense: 5 ’-CACGCTAATGATCGACTTCAA-3’,
antisense: 3 ’-TTGAAGTCGATCATTAGCGTG-5’.

T-cell proliferation assay
BMDCs and naive T cells were isolated from
autologous mice and were co-cultured at a 1:20 ratio
stimulated with or without LM in the presence of IL-2
(20 U/mL) (Protech, London, UK). Then, 200 µl of the
final culture volume was incubated at 37°C for 5 days and
pulsed with [3H] thymidine at 0.4 µCi/well 16 h before
harvesting. Proliferation was measured using a Wallac
1450 scintillation counter. A liquid flash counter was
used to detect CPM values; results were averaged from
readings from 3 holes and expressed using the stimulation
index: SI = (cpminfected - cpmmedium)/(cpmuninfected
- cpmmedium).

Isolation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
and SPCs

Interferon-γ ELISPOT assay

Tumors and spleens were removed from mice or
tissues from HCC patients, and single-cell suspensions
were prepared by enzymatic digestion. Resected tumors
were weighed, minced into small (1–2 mm3) pieces with
a scalpel, and immersed in 10 mL of digestion mixture
(5% FBS in RPMI 1640, 0.5 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche
Diagnostic), 0.2 mg/ml hyaluronidase, type V (SigmaAldrich), and 0.02 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich)) per
0.25 g of tumor tissue. The resulting cell suspensions were
filtered sequentially through 70- and 40-µm cell strainers

Antigen-specific IFN-γ-secreting T cells from naive
T cells promoted by LM-stimulated DCs were detected
using ELISPOT kits (BioSource International, Camarillo,
CA) as previously described[14]. Briefly, the above cocultured cells were added to each well (107 cells/well) and
incubated with IL-2 (5 U/ml) overnight at 37°C. IFN-γ
spots in the wells were then developed according to the

by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)
and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membrane (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). The blots
were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk solution for 1
h at room temperature and incubated overnight with
primary antibodies at 4°C. The primary antibodies used
were rabbit anti-NLRP3, rabbit anti-TLR4, rabbit antiNOD1, rabbit anti-caspase-1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA),
rabbit anti-P65,pP65,P38,pP38,IKKa/b and pIKKa/b, and
anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, USA).
The secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA) were used at 1:2,000 (v/v) dilutions in
PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, and
immunoreactivity was detected using an ECL kit (Thermo
Scientific, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands).

Cytokine analysis
Samples from supernatants were collected and
tested for the presence of cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-12p70,
TNF-a, IFN-r) using corresponding mouse ELISA kits
(Dakewe Biotech, China) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations.

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The extracted RNA was dissolved in DEPCtreated ddH2O and subjected to DNase I treatment (Fisher
Scientific, USA) to avoid genomic DNA contamination.
One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA
using the ABI high-capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription
Master Kit. For quantitative real-time PCR analysis,
cDNA was amplified using the FastStart Universal SYBR
Green Master (ROX) Mix (Roche) in a 7500 Fast RealTime PCR System (ABI). All reactions were performed
in triplicate. The 2-ΔΔCT method was used to measure
the gene expression (OAZ-1 and GAPDH as the internal
control). All primers were designed by Primer Premier
5.0 and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies
(Coralville, IA).
Sequences of all primer sets are shown in the Table
below.

Mice and tumor cell lines
C57BL/6 mice were bred by and purchased from
the Central Animal Lab of Nanjing Medical University.
The experiments were conducted when the mice were 6–8
weeks old. All experimental protocols used in this study
were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of
Nanjing Medical University. Breeding pairs of HLA-A2.1
Tg mice with a C57BL/6 background were purchased
from the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing
University. Six- to eight-week-old Tg mice were used at
the start of the experiments. Hepa1-6, a mouse hepatoma
cell line derived from C57BL/6 mice, was obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).
The cell line Hepa1-6-HLA-A2.1/MPFG stably expresses
HLA-A2.1 and is transformed with the MPFG gene.
Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle
medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Cellgro), 100 U/
ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. All cells were
incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.
To establish the tumor models used in this study,
HLA-A2 Tg mice were challenged with 5×104 Hepa1-6
or Hepa1-6-MPFG (co-expressing HLA-A2 and MFPG)
tumor cells subcutaneously. Three to seven days later,
the tumor-bearing mice were vaccinated with phosphatebuffered saline, LM, DC+LM or SiNLRP3DC+LM (n=5/
group) at weekly intervals for a total of three weeks. Each
week, the tumor sizes were measured with a caliper in two
dimensions, and the tumor volumes (V) were calculated

Western blot
Whole cell lysates were prepared in modified
RIPA buffer (150 mM, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaF,
5 mM EDTA, 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate and
1% Triton X-100) supplemented with phosphatase and
protease inhibitors according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Protein concentrations were measured using the
BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, USA). Equal amounts of
proteins were mixed with SDS sample buffer, resolved

with the equation V = (L×W2) ×0.5, with L = length and
W = width. Mice were killed on day 40. To determine
the effect of the vaccine on tumor development, tumors
and spleens were isolated for cellular immune response
measurements in vivo. Each experiment was performed
at least twice, and results were essentially similar unless
described otherwise.
The animals were housed under specific pathogenfree conditions. All animal protocols were reviewed
and approved by the institutional animal care and use
committee at UTHSCSA.

SPSS software was used for all statistical analyses.
Data were presented as the mean ± SEM. A two-tailed
Student t-test was used to assess significant differences
between control and treatment groups. P<0.05 was
considered to indicate statistically significant differences.

ConFLicts of interest

Paraffin-embedded specimens were deparaffinized
with xylene, rehydrated using graded ethanol, then boiled
in sodium citrate-hydrochloric acid buffer in a pressure
cooker for 10 minutes, and cooled for 30 minutes at
room temperature to expose antigenic epitopes. Then,
the samples were blocked with 5% normal goat serum
in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 minutes at
room temperature. The slides were then incubated with
polyclonal rabbit anti human-CD11c antibody at a dilution
of 1:500 and incubated overnight at room temperature.
After being washed thrice with 0.05% Tween 20 in
PBS for 10 minutes, slides were stained with secondary
antibody for 1 hour and then washed thrice with 0.05%
Tween in PBS for 10 minutes again. Slides were then
stained with hematoxylin and washed with running
water. For immunohistochemical staining, the samples
were then processed using the SP immunohistochemical
kit (Maixin, Fuzhou, China), and the immunoreactive
proteins were detected using a DAB kit (Maixin, Fuzhou,
China). After all the stains, slides were dehydrated with
ethanol followed by dimethylbenzene. Finally, after
being mounted with cover slides, samples were observed
under the microscope (Nikon, Eclipse 80i). The number
of positive cells per field of each index was obtained by
counting five separated fields (×100) with Image-Pro Plus
software (v. 5.0).
