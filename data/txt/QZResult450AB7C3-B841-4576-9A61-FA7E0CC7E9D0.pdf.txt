BACKGROUND: Preclinical testing suggests the combination of carboplatin and irinotecan has at least
additive antitumor activity. The primary objectives of the current study were to determine the maximum
tolerated doses (MTDs) and recommended phase 2 doses of carboplatin administered with irinotecan to
pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors. METHODS: This was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm
dose escalation study in which subjects with refractory solid tumors received 21-day treatment cycles of intravenous carboplatin on Day 1 followed by intravenous irinotecan administered daily for 10 days within 2
consecutive weeks. The plasma pharmacokinetics of ultrafiltrable platinum, irinotecan, and 2 irinotecan
metabolites were determined during Cycle 1. The interpatient plan for dose escalation at study initiation
was to increase irinotecan first followed by increases in carboplatin. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients with a
median age of 8.5 years (range, 1-21 years) were enrolled with a variety of solid tumors. Two of 6 subjects
at the first dose level (carboplatin target area under the curve [AUC], 4.0 mg/mL*min; irinotecan, 18 mg/
m2/dose) experienced dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxicities requiring a dose de-escalation scheme (carboplatin AUC, 4.0 mg/mL*min; irinotecan, 15 mg/m2/dose). Three of 6 subjects at the second dose level
experienced dose-limiting gastrointestinal complications and bone marrow suppression. A further dose deescalation to carboplatin AUC of 4.0 mg/mL*min and irinotecan of 12 mg/m2/dose resulted in dose-limiting
bone marrow suppression in 1 of 13 patients treated at that dose, and therefore was determined to be the
MTD. One complete response (in a patient with medulloblastoma) and 3 partial responses (in patients
with neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and lymphoendothelial carcinoma, respectively) were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The recommended phase 2 dose in heavily pretreated pediatric patients is carboplatin

KEY WORDS: phase 1, carboplatin, irinotecan, pediatric, pharmacokinetics.

Irinotecan is a water-soluble camptothecan derivative that inhibits topoisomerase I (topo I), an enzyme
involved in DNA repair, transcription, and replication.13
Single-agent irinotecan has demonstrated antitumor
activity in xenograft models of childhood tumors including neuroblastoma, sarcomas, and brain tumors.4-6 Irinotecan is a prodrug that is metabolized by
carboxylesterase enzymes to form SN-38, which is 100
to 1000 times more potent as a topo I inhibitor than irinotecan.7-11 Common toxicities include diarrhea, elevated transaminases, and myelosuppression when given
in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. A
variety of schedules for irinotecan have been used,
although there is preclinical evidence to suggest that a
protracted administration schedule enhances efficacy
while decreasing hematologic toxicity.12 However, the
Children’s Oncology Group recently completed a study
comparing the response rate in an ‘‘upfront phase 2 window’’ to 2 different irinotecan schedules (daily  5 days
vs daily  5 days for 2 consecutive weeks) in combination with vincristine in children experiencing their first
recurrence/progression of rhabdomyosarcoma or undifferentiated sarcoma. In these patients with recurrent disease, the prolonged schedule appeared to offer no added
benefit over the shorter 5-day schedule (unpublished
data). Given the importance of irinotecan metabolism
on its efficacy and toxicity, it is necessary to understand
how the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan are affected by
combination chemotherapy regimens.
Carboplatin is a platinum-based compound that
causes DNA cross-links and single-strand breaks.13,14
It has established activity against several pediatric
tumors, including neuroblastoma and brain tumors.15-24
Major toxicities include myelosuppression and renal
impairment.
The combination of carboplatin and irinotecan
has been studied in adults with a variety of cancers and
is well tolerated.25-31 Toxicities are mostly nonoverlapping; however, the combination can result in enhanced
myelosuppression. Given the single-agent efficacy of
208

carboplatin and irinotecan in a variety of pediatric
tumors and the promising experience in adults, this
combination is worthy of evaluation in pediatric
patients with recurrent solid tumors. Therefore, a phase
1 study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the combination was conducted.
The primary objective was to determine a maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose
for pediatric patients. Secondary objectives included
determining dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and plasma
pharmacokinetics of carboplatin, irinotecan, and irinotecan metabolites, as well as assessing antitumor activity
within the context of a phase 1 trial. At the time of study
design, it was expected that combination therapy could be
achieved with close to MTDs of each agent. Given particular interest in the use of irinotecan for the target population, irinotecan dosing was initiated at 90% of the singleagent phase 2 dose.6 Carboplatin was dosed at approximately 67% of the recommended dose when used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.32 The
intent was to dose escalate the irinotecan and then the
carboplatin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
Patients ages 1 to 21 years with a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of a solid malignancy that had
progressed on standard therapy or for which no standard
effective therapy was known were eligible to enroll after
written and voluntary informed consent from patients or
their legal guardians. Patient assent was obtained if appropriate. The study was approved by each institution’s institutional review board. Other criteria included:
measurable or nonmeasurable disease; adequate bone
marrow function (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] >1.0
 109/L and platelet count >100,000  106/L); adequate
hepatic function (total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL and alanine
transaminase 2.5 times the institutional upper limit of

normal); adequate renal function (glomerular filtration
rate [GFR] >30 mL/min/m2 as measured by creatinine
clearance or radionuclide scan); at least a 4-week interval
since the last immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy; life expectancy of at least 8 weeks; recovery to
baseline or grade 1 from toxicities resulting from prior
therapy; Karnofsky score or Lansky play scale 50; and a
negative pregnancy test. Patients were ineligible or
excluded for any of the following reasons: >3 prior chemotherapy regimens; serious uncontrolled medical disorder
or infection; symptomatic brain metastases; receiving phenytoin, phenobarbitol, primidone, carbamazepine, or valproic acid; and having previously underwent bone
marrow transplantation.
Study Design, Treatment, and Dose
Escalation
This was an open-label, single-arm dose escalation study
in which subjects received a 21-day treatment cycle of intravenous carboplatin on Day 1 followed by intravenous
irinotecan administered daily for 10 days within 2 consecutive weeks (Fig. 1) at the following institutions: Children’s National Medical Center, Washington, DC;
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York,
New York; St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee; Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; University of Arizona Health
Sciences Center, Tucson, Arizona; Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri; Hospital
CIMA Centro Internacional de Medicina Avanzada, San
Jose, Costa Rica; and Nemours Children’s Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida. Commercial supplies of carboplatin and
irinotecan were provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb.
The initial dose level was carboplatin given at a target area under the curve (AUC) of 4.0 mg/mL/min
administered over 50 minutes followed 10 minutes later
by intravenous irinotecan at a dose of 18 mg/m2 administered over 60 minutes. A total of 10 doses of irinotecan

were given over the first 15 days of each 21-day cycle. The
carboplatin dose was calculated as previously described32
using the following formula:
Carboplatin dose (mg/m2) ¼ target AUC (mg/
mL*min)  ([0.93  GFR (mL/min/m2)] þ 15).
The initial dose escalation schema planned to
increase irinotecan first followed by increases in carboplatin using a traditional 3-plus-3 phase 1 trial design such
that cohorts of 3 subjects would be treated at each dose
level. Escalation to the next dose level was permitted if
each subject at the current dose level completed the first
cycle of treatment without experiencing a DLT. If 1 of the
first 3 evaluable patients developed a DLT during Course
1, up to 3 additional subjects were enrolled at that dose
level. If 2 subjects at a particular dose level experienced a
DLT at any time during the first cycle, then the MTD
would be exceeded. The MTD was to be expanded to treat
at least 9 subjects to determine a recommended phase 2
dose. Dose escalation within individual subjects was not
permitted.
Given unanticipated toxicities at the planned initial
dose level, the study was amended to include a dose deescalation scheme (Table 1).
DLTs were defined as any of the following events
that could be considered possibly, most likely, or definitely related to study drug therapy: grade 4 neutropenia
(ie, ANC <500 cells/mm3) for >7 consecutive days;
grade 4 febrile neutropenia (ie, life-threatening infection);
thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3) for >7 consecutive
days; thrombocytopenia requiring >2 platelet

transfusions within a period of 7 consecutive days; grade 3
or greater nausea and/or vomiting despite the use of
adequate/maximal medical intervention and/or prophylaxis; grade 3 or greater diarrhea despite the use of
adequate/maximal medical intervention and/or prophylaxis; any other grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicity
except alopecia, anorexia, fatigue/asthenia, or transient
arthralgia/myalgia (unless unresponsive to maximal medical intervention); retreatment delay of >1 week between
consecutive irinotecan doses within a cycle because of
delayed recovery from a toxicity related to treatment with
carboplatin and irinotecan; and retreatment delay of >2
weeks from the scheduled start date of a subsequent cycle
because of delayed recovery from a toxicity related to
treatment with carboplatin and irinotecan.
All subjects were followed for at least 30 days after
the last dose of therapy and then every 4 weeks until study
drug-related toxicities were resolved or were deemed irreversible. Subjects were to receive treatment at the assigned
dose level for a maximum of 12 courses provided they did
not experience a DLT. Escalation to the next higher dose
level was permitted if all 3 patients at the current dose
level completed their first cycle of treatment and no
patient experienced a DLT. Enrollment to an open cohort
occurred simultaneously (ie, data from the initial patients
enrolled to a given cohort were not required to continue
enrollment to that cohort).
Patients were required to receive the Day 1 infusion
and at least 1 irinotecan dose in the second week of each
course at the treating institution. Home infusions of other
irinotecan doses were permitted.
No other chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiotherapy was permitted while the subject was in the study. Granulocyte-colony-stimulating
factor was administered at a dose of 5 lg/kg/day subcutaneously or intravenously 1 day after the 10th dose of irinotecan in a treatment cycle and continued until the
ANC was >1.0  109/L. Atropine was prescribed for
early diarrhea and loperamide for delayed onset diarrhea.
Antiemetic regimens were prescribed at the discretion of
the treating physician.

Pharmacokinetic Evaluation
The plasma pharmacokinetics of ultrafiltrable platinum,
irinotecan, SN-38 (the active irinotecan metabolite), and
210

APC (RPR-121056; another irinotecan metabolite) were
determined during Cycle 1 with scheduled blood collections immediately before chemotherapy, at 30 minutes,
48 minutes, 90 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8
hours, 24 hours, and then on Days 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12.
Approximately 18 mL of blood was obtained from each
patient for pharmacokinetic study during the first 24
hours of the study, and an additional 5 mL was collected
for the remainder of the study. Samples were collected in
tubes containing liquid K3 ethylenediamine tetraacetic
acid as the anticoagulant and immediately centrifuged for
5 minutes at 3000  g to generate plasma. Plasma (0.4
mL) was taken for ultrafiltration, and the remaining
plasma was flash frozen and stored at 70 C until further
analysis.
The 0.4-mL plasma sample was immediately transferred to an ultrafiltration device, and centrifuged with a
fixed angle head at 1000  g for 20 minutes at 10 C to
15 C. Ultrafiltrate was transferred to a labeled tube and
stored at 20 C or colder until shipment for further
analysis.
Plasma samples were assayed for the concentration
of the lactone form of irinotecan, SN-38, and APC by a
validated high-performance liquid chromatographic-mass
spectrometric method.33 Plasma ultrafiltrate samples were
analyzed for platinum concentrations by a validated
flameless atomic absorption method.34 The following
pharmacokinetic values for irinotecan, SN-38, APC, and
ultrafiltrable platinum were determined: maximum
plasma concentration (Cmax), the time to reach Cmax,
mean residence time, plasma elimination half-life, and
AUC. In addition, total body clearance and volume of distribution at steady state were calculated for irinotecan and
ultrafiltrable platinum, and the predose plasma concentrations of irinotecan and its metabolites on Days 3, 5, 8, 10,
and 12 were evaluated for evidence of accumulation.

Treatment Assessment
Pre-enrollment evaluations included a complete medical
history and physical examination, complete blood count
(CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), audiogram, creatinine clearance, chest x-ray, and tumor measurements. CBCs were performed weekly. Physical
examinations with evaluation of symptoms, CBC, CMP,
and creatinine clearance were performed before the start

of each cycle. Audiograms were repeated before every
other cycle.
Adverse events were assessed using the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version
2.0).35 Consistent imaging for tumor assessments was performed at enrollment, after every second cycle of therapy,
and upon study completion, withdrawal, or discontinuation of therapy. Patients were evaluated for response
according to the international Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete
response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all clinical and radiologic evidence of tumor, a partial response
(PR) was defined as a decrease of 30% in the sum of the
longest dimension of all lesions, and progressive disease
was defined as a >20% increase in the sum of the longest
dimension of all lesions or the presence of a new lesion.
Stable disease indicated neither sufficient increase nor
decrease in tumor burden to categorize otherwise.
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize clinical
safety and laboratory observations

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Treatment
Administration
Twenty-eight patients with a median age of 8.5 years
(range, 1-21 years) with the following tumor types were
enrolled: osteosarcoma (5 patients), neuroblastoma (4
patients), hepatoblastoma (4 patients), astrocytoma (3
patients), rhabdomyosarcoma (3 patients), medulloblastoma (2 patients), Wilms tumor (2 patients), atypical teratoid (1 patient), synovial sarcoma (1 patient), glioma (1
patient), lymphoepithelial carcinoma (1 patient), and alveolar soft part sarcoma (1 patient) (Table 2).
Twenty-three of the 28 patients had received prior
chemotherapy; 10 had received prior carboplatin, 17 had
received prior cisplatin, and 13 patients had received at
least 2 prior treatment regimens. Four patients had
received prior topotecan, but none had received irinotecan. Eighteen of these 28 patients had received prior
radiotherapy.
Six subjects were enrolled on Dose Level 1 (carboplatin AUC of 4 and irinotecan, 18 mg/m2/day). Two
subjects experienced a DLT. One patient experienced
grade 3 diarrhea. Another patient had grade 3 epistaxis,

grade 3 diarrhea, grade 3 ileus, and grade 3 dehydration.
Because the initial dose level exceeded the MTD, the protocol was amended, and a de-escalation scheme was
designed (Table 1) using lower irinotecan doses given particular concerns regarding gastrointestinal DLT.
Six subjects were enrolled on Dose Level 1 (carboplatin AUC 4 and irinotecan 15 mg/m2/day). Three of 6
subjects at the second dose level experienced DLTs,
including 1 patient with grade 4 neutropenia for >7 days,
grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and grade 3 hemorrhage. One
patient had grade 4 abdominal pain and a grade 3 catheter
infection. One patient had delayed hematologic recovery.
The subsequent cohort of subjects was treated at Dose
Level 2 with further de-escalation of the irinotecan
dose.
Four patients were assigned to Dose Level 2 (carboplatin AUC of 4 and irinotecan, 12 mg/m2/day). No
DLTs were observed, and 3 subsequent patients were enrolled at Dose Level 2a with escalation of the carboplatin dose to an AUC of 5 with irinotecan, 12 mg/m2/day.
All 3 subjects treated on Dose Level 2a experienced a
DLT, including at least 1 of the following: prolonged
thrombocytopenia, grade 3 diarrhea, grade 3 abdominal
pain, and/or excessive platelet transfusion requirement.

Mean plasma ultrafiltrate concentrations of platinum after the administration of carboplatin and irinotecan are shown. AUC indicates area under the curve.

Dose Level 2 was identified as the MTD. Nine
additional subjects were treated at this dose level. Only
1 of the 13 patients treated at the MTD experienced
DLTs (grade 3 bone pain, grade 4 neutropenia for >7
days, and prolonged hematologic recovery). Thus, Dose
Level 2 was determined to be the recommended phase
2 dose.
Pharmacokinetics Results
The mean plasma concentration-time profile of irinotecan, SN-38, and APC after iv administration of carboplatin (AUC of 4) and irinotecan (12, 15, and 18 mg/m2) on
Day 1 are depicted in Figure 2a. The mean plasma concentration-time profile of platinum after the intravenous
administration of carboplatin (AUC of 4) and irinotecan
(12, 15, and 18 mg/m2) on Day 1 is depicted in Figure 2b.
Pharmacokinetic parameter values of irinotecan and
metabolites are detailed in Table 3, and pharmacokinetic
parameter values of platinum from carboplatin are
detailed in Table 4. The exposure of patients to SN-38
and APC determined in this study are consistent with values previously reported for this protracted low-dose regimen.36 As such, the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan are
apparently not affected by concurrent carboplatin. However, the trough plasma concentrations provide evidence
of possible SN-38 and APC accumulation for this protracted regimen.

Efficacy
Tumor evaluations were centrally reviewed for all patients
to determine each patient’s best overall response.
Of the 28 patients treated in this study, 1 patient
achieved a CR, 3 patients acheived a PR, and 10 patients
had stable disease. Among the patients who had not previously received chemotherapy, there were no objective radiographic responses to protocol therapy noted.
A 2-year-old with medulloblastoma achieved a CR
after the fourth cycle of therapy at Dose Level 2
(MTD). The disease recurred 9 months later. The patient
had received prior carboplatin and cisplatin.
One PR occurred in a 15-year-old with lymphoepithelial carcinoma after the second cycle of therapy at Dose
Level 1, and the disease recurred 3 months later. The patient
had received prior cisplatin. Two other PRs occurred in
patients who were treated at Dose Level 2 (MTD). A PR
occurred in a 4-year-old with medulloblastoma after the second cycle of therapy, and the disease recurred 3 months
later. The patient had received prior cisplatin. Another PR
occurred in a 3-year-old with neuroblastoma after the second cycle of therapy, and disease recurrence was documented 2 months later. The patient had received prior
carboplatin and cisplatin as well as high-dose chemotherapy
with peripheral stem cell transplant.
Ten patients had stable disease while receiving therapy (2 patients with osteosarcoma, 2 with astrocytoma, 1
with glioma, 1 with synovial sarcoma, 1 with

DISCUSSION
This phase 1 study was conducted to characterize a novel
schedule of the combination of carboplatin and irinoteCancer

can, 2 agents that have demonstrated single-agent activity
in a variety of pediatric solid malignancies. Irinotecan dosing was initiated at 90% of the single-agent phase 2 dose,6
and carboplatin was dosed at approximately 67% of the
recommended dose when used in combination with other
chemotherapeutic agents.32 The intent was to dose
213

escalate the irinotecan and then the carboplatin. However,
significant gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicities
were encountered that required de-escalation of the irinotecan dose. Despite the irinotecan dose de-escalation, the
concurrent carboplatin dose could not be further
escalated.
The protracted irinotecan regimen used (ie, daily 
5 for 2 weeks) was based on preclinical data suggesting
improved efficacy with this schedule.6,12 Other studies
using this schedule reported toxicities similar to those
found in this study. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering study
with single-agent irinotecan reported diarrhea as the predominant toxicity, with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia observed in fewer patients.37 The Italian Soft Tissue
Sarcoma Committee performed a phase 2 study of irinotecan (20 mg/m2/day for 5 days a week, for 2 consecutive
weeks) and found the main toxicity to be diarrhea with
limited hematologic toxicity.38 In 2 consecutive phase 2
window studies of irinotecan alone and in combination
with vincristine for patients with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma, the Children’s Oncology Group concluded that
irinotecan (20 mg/m2/day for 5 days a week, for 2 consecutive weeks) was effective and generally well tolerated,
with gastrointestinal toxicities being the most common
adverse events.39 A Children’s Oncology Group phase 2
trial of irinotecan (50 mg/m2/day for 5 days repeated every 3 weeks) in refractory pediatric solid tumors was well
tolerated but not effective as a single agent in a variety of
solid tumors with the exception of medulloblastoma
(16% response rate).40 A recently completed ‘‘upfront
phase 2 window’’ study found similar response rates when
comparing 2 different irinotecan schedules (daily  5
days vs daily  5 days for 2 consecutive weeks) in combination with vincristine in children experiencing their first
recurrence/progression of rhabdomyosarcoma or undifferentiated sarcoma (unpublished data). Thus, although
there is preclinical evidence to suggest that a prolonged
administration schedule is more efficacious, it is unclear
precisely which schedule is ideal. Particularly in patients
with recurrent disease, a shorter 5-day schedule would be
more convenient than a longer schedule and would be a
reasonable consideration for future studies using
irinotecan.
In contrast to irinotecan, carboplatin’s predominant
DLT is myelosuppression. Combined with ifosfamide
and etoposide, the recommended dose for carboplatin is
214

an AUC 6-7.32 As demonstrated by the finding that it was
not possible to escalate the carboplatin dose beyond an
AUC of 4, the current study found increased hematologic
toxicity in this moderately to heavily pretreated patient
population. The hematologic toxicity observed likely
demonstrates the potential additive myelosuppressive
effects of irinotecan (and/or its metabolites) in previously
treated patients.
Multiple dosing schedules of the combination of irinotecan and carboplatin have been studied in adults with
a variety of malignancies,25-27 including lung cancer,29-31
ovarian cancer,28 and non-Hodgkins lymphoma.41 As in
the current study, the main toxicities were gastrointestinal
and hematologic, and efficacy in phase 1 of 2 studies has
been encouraging. Studies in adults tended not to use a
protracted irinotecan schedule, so comparison between
the adult experience and this study is limited.
The pharmacokinetics of single-agent irinotecan and
its metabolites has been reported in adults using a variety of
dosing schedules9,42,43 and in children with solid tumors
receiving 20, 24, or 29 mg/m2 of irinotecan daily for 5 days
for 2 weeks36,44 or 50 mg/m2/day for 5 days repeated every
3 weeks.40 To our knowledge, the current study is the first
report of irinotecan pharmacokinetics in children when
given in combination with carboplatin. Pharmacokinetic
data were available from 20 patients for platinum and 22
patients for irinotecan and its metabolites. As seen in singleagent irinotecan studies,7,36,44 the exposure levels of SN-38
were very variable. In a previous study in children receiving
20 mg/m2 of irinotecan, the mean AUC of irinotecan lactones, SN-38, and APC were 423, 28.4, and 57.0 ng/mL/
hour, respectively.44 These results are consistent with the
values observed in the current study. In the current study,
irinotecan plasma clearance when given with carboplatin
was similar to that reported in the Children’s Oncology
Group phase 2 trial of irinotecan.40 The current study suggests there is no effect of carboplatin on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan or its metabolites. Limited patient
numbers prevent a significant correlation between individual patient pharmacokinetics and outcome.
A recommended phase 2 dose of combination carboplatin and irinotecan for heavily pretreated patients
was determined to be carboplatin (AUC of 4 mg/mL/
min  1 day) and irinotecan (12 mg/m2/day  10 days).
Although the study was not designed to study efficacy,
the activity observed was encouraging. Of 13 patients

treated at the recommended phase 2 dose, objective
responses were documented in 3 patients. All responders
had received prior cisplatin, and 2 had also received prior
carboplatin.
Although the combination of carboplatin and irinotecan was tolerated only when using doses of each drug that
are well below the single-agent MTD, activity was observed
for some heavily pretreated patients with refractory tumors.
This suggests potential additive antitumor activity through
as yet unknown mechanisms. For medulloblastomas, neuroblastomas, and sarcomas in particular, these findings support further investigation of combination carboplatin and
irinotecan for pediatric solid malignancies.
