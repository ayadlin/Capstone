Abstract
A role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family
has been suggested in colon cancer etiology, progression, and/
or severity. Our recently identified pan-erbB inhibitor EGFRrelated protein (ERRP) targets EGFRs by attenuating their
activation and subsequent signaling leading to cellular growth
inhibition. In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic
effectiveness of ERRP on early and intermediate stages of
colon cancer by examining regression of chemically induced
aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the colon of CF1 mice and
intestinal adenomas in APCMin+/ (Min) mice. After formation
of ACF or adenomas, the mice were injected (i.p.) with ERRP
(50 Mg/mouse) for 10 consecutive days. This treatment
significantly reduced the number of ACF from 25.0 F 3.0
(controls) to 14.9 F 1.6 (ERRP-treated; P = 0.011) and also
reduced their size (P < 0.01). In Min mice, ERRP caused the
regression of adenomas throughout the small intestine
(P < 0.05) and reduced their size (P < 0.001). This could
partly be attributed to inhibition of proliferation and
stimulation of apoptosis in the intestinal mucosa and was
associated with decreased activation of several EGFR family
members, suppression of downstream effector nuclear factor
KB and down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2. ERRP-induced
attenuation of EGFR activation could be due to increased
sequestration of the ligand(s) by ERRP, rendering them
unavailable for binding to and activation of the receptor. In
conclusion, our data show that ERRP is effective in regressing
both early and intermediate intestinal lesions and could be an
effective therapeutic agent for colon cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Recent advances in molecular and cellular biology have aided in
the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of cancer. A
number of genes have now been identified as abnormally expressed
in cancer and, thus, serve as targets for therapeutic intervention.
The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) family, which
consist of EGFR itself and three related receptors called ErbB-2/
HER-2, ErbB-3/HER-3, and ErbB-4/HER-4 (collectively called

EGFRs), is one of these genes. Each receptor, with the exception
of ErbB-2, is activated by one or more EGF-related peptides,
such as EGF, transforming growth factor (TGF)-a, heparin-binding
(HB)-EGF, and amphiregulin. Binding of the ligand induces
homodimerization or heterodimerization of the receptors and
phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues at the intracellular
domain. These phosphorylation sites provide docking sites for
adapter proteins, which, in turn, activate downstream signaling
pathways. Except for ErbB-3, all EGFR family members possess
tyrosine kinase activity and are not only involved in the regulation of
cell proliferation and survival but also in differentiation, migration,
and angiogenesis (1).
Aberrant expression or activity of EGFR and/or its family
member(s) has been associated with the development and
progression of many malignancies (2). In particular, the overexpression of ErbB-2 in breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers is
associated with an extremely poor clinical prognosis (3–6) and
early relapses (7, 8). In head and neck, bladder, and lung cancers,
the overexpression of EGFR receptors and their ligands (EGF/
TGF-a) are predictive of poor outcome and disease recurrence
(9, 10). Overexpression of EGFRs has also been reported in colon
cancer (11).
It is becoming increasingly apparent that interference with EGFR
activation and/or its signal transduction pathways represent a
promising strategy for the development of novel and selective
anticancer therapies (12). Indeed, several drugs, such as cetuximab,
trastuzumab, gefitinib, and erlotinib, that target either EGFR or
HER-2 have been developed (13). However, their limited success
may be the result of the overexpression of more than one member
of the EGFR family in solid tumors. Furthermore, coexpression of
multiple EGFR family members leads to an enhanced transforming
potential and worsened prognosis (3, 6). Therefore, identification of
inhibitors targeting multiple members of the EGFR family may
provide a therapeutic benefit to a broad range of patient
population.
EGFR-related protein (ERRP), a 53 to 55 kDa protein which we
isolated and characterized as a pan-erbB inhibitor, targets multiple
members of the EGFR family (14–17). Our studies suggest that
ERRP could be a potential therapeutic agent for colorectal cancer
(18, 19) and perhaps other epithelial cancers as well (20–22). We
have reported that ERRP inhibits growth and attenuates basal and
ligand-induced activation of EGFR and/or its family members in
several colon and other epithelial cancer cell lines that express
varying levels of EGFRs with no apparent change in growth of
fibroblast cell lines (15). Furthermore, comparison with cetuximab
(MoAb to EGFR) or trastuzumab (MoAb to HER-2) has revealed
that whereas cetuximab or trastuzumab is effective in inhibiting
growth of epithelial cancer cells that express high levels of EGFR

or HER-2, respectively, ERRP is effective against cancer cells
that express varying levels of EGFR and/or its family members
(15, 20–22).
ERRP has been shown to prevent the growth of SCID mice
xenografts of colon and pancreatic cancer cells without any signs
of toxicity (18, 19, 22). However, it remains to be determined
whether ERRP will be effective in the treatment of existing colonic
lesions in established immunocompetent rodent models. In the
present study, we investigated the therapeutic effectiveness of
ERRP in early and intermediate stages of colon cancer by
examining the disappearance of confirmed aberrant crypt foci
(ACF) in a carcinogen-induced colon cancer model and existing
adenomas in a genetically defined mouse model. The treatment of
rodents with carcinogens induces the same multistep progression
described in humans and is such a widely accepted model to test
chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic potency of various
agents. ACF, which were initially described by Bird (23), have also
been detected in humans with colon cancer (24, 25) and are
thought to be precursors of adenomas and carcinomas (4) and,
thus, represent the earliest stages of colon cancer. The multiple
intestinal neoplasia (APCMin+/ , Min) mice spontaneously develop
tumors throughout the intestinal tract due to mutations in the
adenomatous polyposis coli gene, which are also found in patients
with familial adenomatous polyposis and in 40% to 80% of
patients with sporadic colon cancer (26, 27). Min mice provide an
excellent model for intermediate stages of colon cancer. Both
models show aberrant expression of EGFRs. In carcinogen-treated
animals, ACF and colon tumors frequently overexpress not only
EGFR (28–31) but also ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 (32). Overexpression of
ErbB-4 is not as frequent and seems to be more relevant in later
stages of colon cancer (5). Whereas overexpression of EGFR has
been reported in Min tumors and in colonocytes of Min mice (33),
no information is available on other EGFR family members. Thus,
these rodent models provide ideal molecular targets for therapeutic approaches and were used in the present studies to
investigate the regression of early and intermediate stages of colon
cancer.

Materials and Methods
Animals. Female CF1 mice (5 weeks) were purchased from Charles
Rivers. Min mice (8 weeks; male C57BL/6J-APCMin+/ ) and C57BL/6J
littermates (the genetic background of Min mice) were obtained from The
Jackson Laboratory. The mice were housed at 10 per cage. They had free
access to regular rodent chow and tab water and were maintained in a
relative humidity of 50% to 60%, a temperature of 23jC, and a 12:12 h lightdark cycle. They were monitored for any signs of illness. All procedures
involving animals were approved by the Animal Investigation Committee at
Wayne State University School of Medicine.
Generation of recombinant ERRP. ERRP fusion protein was generated
using the Drosophila expression system as described previously (18). The
stable Schneider 2 Drosophila cells containing pMT/ERRP-V5-His plasmid
were incubated with 0.5 mmol/L CuSO4 to stimulate the expression of
V5-His-tagged ERRP fusion protein. Cells were lysed, and ERRP was purified
by two sequential immunoaffinity columns: anti-ERRP, followed by a second
column of antipolyhistidine antibodies (18).
Carcinogen and ERRP treatment. After 1 week of acclimatization, the
mice were injected i.p. with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (30 mg/kg bodyweight in
300 AL neutral buffered 10 mmol/L NaHCO3) once per week for 6 weeks.
This dose has been successfully used in our previous studies (34, 35).
Formation of ACF was confirmed in a few carcinogen-treated mice. One
week after the last injection of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, the animals were
randomly divided into two groups of 10. They received daily i.p. injections of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

50 Ag ERRP in 100 AL HEPES buffer for 10 days, whereas the controls
received vehicle. The dose of ERRP was chosen on the basis of our
observation that s.c. injections of ERRP at doses 15 or 25 Ag inhibited
growth of SCID mice xenografts of colon or pancreatic cells with no signs of
toxicity (18, 19, 22) and also that doses of ERRP up to 100 Ag were well
tolerated by SCID mice (data not shown). The mice were killed by CO2
asphyxiation, the colons were excised and opened longitudinally, and three
randomly selected colons from each group were gently scraped with a glass
slide, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80jC for biochemical
determinations. Colons from the other animals were fixed overnight in 10%
neutral buffered formalin for ACF determination and immunohistochemical
analyses.
ACF determination. The formalin-fixed colons were stained in 0.2%
methylene blue for 20 min, and the number and size of ACF were recorded
using a dissecting microscope with 10 or 20 magnification in a blinded
manner. The tissues were then embedded into paraffin, and sectioned at
4 to 5 Ag for immunohistochemical analyses.
Determination of tumor number and size in Min mice. Min mice
were maintained on regular chow diet until they were 10 weeks old. At this
time, all tumors have been formed but continue to grow in size (36). The
mice were injected (i.p.) with ERRP or vehicle as described above. After
10 injections, they were killed by CO2 asphyxiation; the intestinal tract was
excised, and 4 cm from the proximal (jejunum) and distal (ileum) small
intestine were removed, opened longitudinally, and then rinsed with icecold PBS. They were fixed overnight in formalin, and the number and size of
the tumors were recorded using a dissecting microscope with 4 to 10
magnification. Subsequently, the tissue was embedded in paraffin and
sectioned for immunohistochemical analyses. From the rest of the small
intestine, the epithelial layer was gently scraped with a glass slide and flashfrozen for further analyses. The number of colonic tumors was noted, and
tumor volume was calculated by the formula V = {W 2  L}/2, wherein V is
tumor volume, W is width, and L is length.
The tumors were excised and flash frozen, and 1 cm of the distal colons
were fixed whereas the epithelial layer was harvested from the rest of the
tissue. Tissues from the genetic background C57BL/J mice were processed
exactly the same way and served as a baseline control.
Determination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunoreactivity. Determination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)
immunoreactivity, as a measure of proliferative activity, was done as
described previously (37). Briefly, sections were deparaffinized and microwaved in citrate buffer for antigen retrieval. The slides were incubated with
anti-PCNA antibody. The immunocomplex was visualized with the labeled
streptavidin-biotin system (Vector) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. 3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole was used as chromagen to localize
PCNA-positive cells. All slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. At
least 10 well-oriented crypts on each slide and five slides from each sample
were examined in a blinded manner. At least 750 cells per slide were
counted using 40 objective. The labeling index was calculated as the
number of total labeled cells  100/total cells per high power focus.
Determination of apoptosis by TUNEL assay. Intestinal sections were
prepared as described above, and the TUNEL assay was done to detect
apoptotic cells using the In situ Cell Death Detection kit from Roche
Applied Science according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 3-Amino-9ethylcarbazole was used as chromagen, and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Apoptotic cell nuclei appeared as red-stained
structures against a blue-violet background. Mucosal areas of all stained
tissues were measured with a 100-division eyepiece reticule and 10
objective. The apoptotic cells within the mucosa of each section were
counted.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Western blot
analysis was done using our standard protocol (14). Briefly, the tissues
were solubilized in lysis buffer. After clarification at 10,000  g for 15 min,
the supernatant was used for Western blot analysis. Protein concentration
was standardized among the samples, and immunoprecipitates of mucosal
lysates containing the same amount of protein were separated by SDSPAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Osmonics),
blocked for nonspecific binding, and probed with one of the following

antibodies (1:1,000 dilution): total EGFR, ErbB-2, ErbB-3 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), phospho-EGFR (1173Tyr; Upstate Biotechnology), phospho–
ErbB-2/HER-2 (1248Tyr), phospho–ErbB-3/HER-3 (1289Tyr), or anti–TGF-a
antibodies (Cell Signaling). After incubation with appropriate secondary
antibodies, the protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). All Western blots were done at least thrice for each
experiment. Densitometric measurements of the scanned bands (HP
Precision Pro 3.13, Hewlett-Packard) were done using the digitized scientific
software program UN-SCNAT. h-Actin or a-tubulin was used for
normalization.
Nuclear protein extraction and electrophoretic mobility shift assay.
Nuclear proteins were extracted from colonic mucosa as described
earlier (38) with slight modifications. Briefly, tissues were homogenized
on ice using a Dounce homogenizer in 0.05 mL of ice-cold buffer A
[10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L MgCI2,
0.5 mmol/L DTT, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630, and 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)] followed by centrifuging at 5000  g at 4jC for
10 min. The crude nuclear pellet was suspended in 25 AL of buffer B
[20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 420 mmol/L
NaCI, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, 0.2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L PMSF, and 4 Amol/L
leupeptin] and incubated on ice for 30 min with intermittent vortexing.
After centrifugation at 14,000  g at 4jC for 30 min, the supernatant
(nuclear proteins) was collected and protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Pierce Chemical Co.).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was done by incubating 10 Ag
of nuclear extract with IRDye-700 labeled nuclear factor nB (NF-nB)
oligonucleotide. The incubation mixture included 25 mmol/L DTT and
0.25% Tween 20 in a binding buffer. The DNA-protein complex formed was
separated from free oligonucleotide on 8.0% native polyacrylamide gel
using a buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris, 200 mmol/L glycine (pH 8.5),
and 1 mmol/L EDTA and visualized by Odyssey IR imaging system.
Supershift analyseswere done by additional 30-min incubation at room
temperature withspecific(p65) and nonspecific antibody (cyclin D1) before
the addition of labeled probe.
Statistical analysis. Unless otherwise stated, data are expressed as
means F SD. Where applicable, the results were analyzed using a two-tailed
Student’s t test after ANOVA, taking P < 0.05 as the levels of significance.

Results
ERRP regresses early and intermediate stages of colon
cancer. The objective of this investigation was to test the
effectiveness of ERRP in eradicating existing colonic lesions using
widely accepted rodent models for early and intermediate stages
of colon cancer. Carcinogen-induced ACF, representing early
stages of colon cancer, were confirmed in a separate control
group before ERRP treatment began. Treatment with recombinant
ERRP for 10 consecutive days significantly reduced the number of
ACF (25.0 F 3.02 versus 14.9 F 1.57, for controls and ERRPtreated, respectively; P = 0.011; Fig. 1A), indicating an eradication
of existing early lesions in the colon by ERRP. However, at this
time, we cannot exclude the possibility that ERRP also prevents
the formation of new lesions. Most of the ACF were located in the
distal and mid part of the colons, whereas very few were detected
in the proximal colon. This distribution did not change between
the two groups.
It has been postulated that the size of the ACF may be a
better prognostic indicator of tumor formation. Treatment with
ERRP significantly reduced the number of aberrant crypts per
focus (1.81 F 0.06 versus 1.42 F 0.08, for control and ERRPtreated animals, respectively; P < 0.01; Fig. 1B). Furthermore,
single-crypt ACF seemed to be less developed in the ERRPtreated group than the controls, as indicated by their size and
staining intensity.
Next, we determined the therapeutic effectiveness of ERRP on
intermediate stages of colon cancer by evaluating regression of
adenomas in Min mice in response to recombinant ERRP.
Treatment of Min mice began when most, if not all, tumors had
already developed. As shown in Fig. 1C, ERRP caused a significant
regression of adenomas in the small intestine (19.2 F 10.06 versus
9.29 F 3.99, for controls and ERRP-treated, respectively; P = 0.035).
This was evident in both the jejunum (5.2 F 1.79 to 3.0 F 1.41;

Figure 1. ERRP treatment (50 Ag/mouse) for 10 d after carcinogen treatment reduced the number (A ; *P < 0.01) and size (B ; **P < 0.001) of existing ACF in
CF1 mice and caused the regression of existing tumors in the small intestine of Min mice (C ; *P < 0.05). This reduction was also seen in the colon (D ) but did not
reach statistical significance. ERRP treatment also reduced tumor size in the small intestine (E; #P < 0.001) and in the tumor volume in the colon of Min mice
(F ; P = 0.074). Ctrl, control.

P < 0.05) and ileum (14.0 F 8.46 to 6.29 F 3.04; P < 0.05), wherein
most of the tumors had formed. ERRP treatment also reduced the
number of tumors found in the colon (0.8 F 0.84 to 0.29 F 0.49)
but this did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 1D). As
expected, no tumors were detected in the C57BL/6J mice. We
then evaluated the size of the flat small intestinal tumors and the
volume of sessile colonic tumors. The size of the small intestinal
tumors was significantly reduced by ERRP (control 1.36 F 0.84
mm, ERRP-treated 0.95 F 0.58 mm; P < 0.001; Fig. 1E). This was
seen both in the jejunum (1.73 F 0.82 to 1.12 F 0.61; P = 0.007)
and the ileum (1.26 F 0.80 to 0.88 F 0.55; P = 0.007). The volume
of the colonic tumors was also reduced (control 14.19 F 7.14,
ERRP-treated 1.27 F 0.75); however, this did not reach statistical
significance (Fig. 1F), which could be attributed to the small
number of colonic tumors.
Neither weekly injection of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine nor daily
injection of recombinant ERRP to 1,2-dimethylhydrazine–treated
mice or Min mice produced signs of illness at any time during
this study. In addition, no macroscopically visible morphologic
changes (i.e., size, shape, or color) in any of the major organs
were detected in any group. This confirms the observations from
previous studies showing no apparent toxic side effects of the
ERRP treatment.
ERRP inhibits proliferation and stimulates apoptosis in
macroscopically normal colonic mucosa of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine–treated and Min mice. An increased proliferation has
been identified as a driving force for carcinogenesis (39). Earlier
studies have shown that 1,2-dimethylhydrazine treatment stimulates proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in the colonic mucosa of

CF1 mice (40), and in Min mice; a significant increase of
proliferation (41) and crypt fission (42) compared with the genetic
background mice was shown. To determine whether ERRP-induced
regression of ACF and adenomas could at least in part be due to
inhibition of proliferation and stimulation of apoptosis, we
analyzed the formalin-fixed intestinal tissues for changes in
proliferative activity and apoptosis. Changes in proliferative activity
were examined by measuring PCNA immunoreactivity. A significant reduction in proliferation (59%, P < 0.001) was observed in the
ERRP-treated CF1 mice compared with the controls (control
155.8 F 23.3/high power focus; ERRP-treated 63.6 F 11.5/high
power focus; Fig. 2A and B). A comparison of proliferation in the
small intestinal mucosa (where most of the tumors develop in Min
mice) with their genetic background strain C57BL/6J showed that
proliferative activity of the normal appearing Min mucosa is
increased by 750%, confirming results published by other groups.
Treatment with ERRP significantly reduced mucosal proliferation
to f25% of the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 2E). In accordance to
the inhibition of proliferation in the colonic tissue of CF1 mice,
ERRP also reduced elevated proliferation in the Min colon (data not
shown).
Apoptosis was determined using the TUNEL assay. ERRP
treatment significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells in
the colons of CF1 mice by 348% (P < 0.001) when compared with
the corresponding vehicle-treated controls (control 4.2 F 1.3
apoptotic bodies/high power focus; ERRP-treated 18.8 F 2.8
apoptotic bodies/high power focus; Fig. 2C and D). Apoptosis
in the small intestine was found to be significantly lower in Min
mice by f40% when compared with the C57BL/6J littermates but

up-regulated by ERRP by 350% compared with the vehicle controls
(control 2.2 F 0.05 apoptotic bodies/high power focus; ERRPtreated 10.2 F 0.82; P = 0.001; Fig. 2F). This increase in apoptosis
after ERRP treatment was also seen in the colon (data not shown).
ERRP inhibits activation of EGFR and its family members.
We have previously shown that ERRP targets the expression and
activity of members of the EGFRs family (14–16). To determine
whether ERRP-induced inhibition of proliferation and stimulation
of apoptosis in the mouse intestinal tract and in turn regression
of ACF and adenomas could be the result of attenuation of
EGFR-activated signal transduction pathways, expression and
constitutive activation (extent of tyrosine phosphorylation) of
EGFR, ErbB-2, and ErbB-3 were analyzed. ERRP caused a marked
reduction of activated EGFR, ErbB-2, and ErbB-3 in the colonic
mucosa of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine–treated CF1 mice, as evidenced
by the decreased levels of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (P <
0.01; Fig. 3A). ERRP also down-regulated EGFR but had little or no
effect on the expression of ErbB-2 and ErbB-3. This suggests that, at
least for ErbB-2 and ErbB-3, the reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation is not the consequence of down-regulation of the receptors.
In Min mice, we found a higher expression of EGFR (77%),
ErbB-2 (8–10%), and ErbB-3 (58%) in the small intestinal mucosa
than in C57BL/6J mice (Fig. 3B), indicating that changes in the
expression of EGFRs is an early event in this model and detectable
in the macroscopically normal appearing intestinal mucosa. However, the levels of activated receptors were not different between
C57BL/6J and Min mice. As observed in CF1 mice, the levels of
total and tyrosine phosphorylated forms of EGFR, ErbB-2, and
ErbB-3 in the small intestine of Min mice were markedly
decreased (50–80%) after ERRP treatment when compared with
vehicle-treated Min mice or their genetic background C57 mice
(Fig. 3B). Similar changes were seen in the colon of Min mice
(data not shown).
Given the importance of EGFRs in the development and
progression of colorectal cancer, our current observation of

www.aacrjournals.org

inhibition of constitutive activation of EGFR, ErbB-2, and ErbB-3
suggests that they may partly be responsible for the ERRP-induced
regression of ACF and adenomas in the mouse intestinal tract. This
underscores the notion that ERRP functions as a pan-erbB
inhibitor in vivo.
Sequestration of TGF-A by ERRP. Although the precise
mechanisms responsible for ERRP-mediated inhibition of EGFR
activation are still to be delineated, we speculated that ERRP with
its substantial homology to the extracellular ligand-binding
domain of EGFRs may sequester their ligands and, thus,
rendering them unavailable to bind to and activate EGFRs.
Ligand sequestration would lead to the formation of inactive
monodimers and heterodimers and, thereby, to an attenuation of
EGFR-activated signaling as depicted in Fig. 4A. This has been
suggested by the results of our previous studies (16, 21). Thus, we
speculated that ERRP will sequester TGF-a, the most common
EGFR ligand synthesized in colonic mucosal cells. To test this
possibility, we determined the amount of TGF-a bound to ERRP
in the intestinal mucosa by immunoprecipitation. In CF1 mice,
the amount of membrane-bound TGF-a precursors bound to
ERRP was found to be significantly higher in ERRP-treated
colonic mucosa compared with vehicle-treated controls (P <
0.001; Fig. 4B). In Min mice, the same increase in ligand
sequestration by ERRP was observed (Fig. 4B).
ERRP inhibits NF-KB activity. NF-nB plays a critical role in
EGFR-Akt–mediated cell survival processes. To determine whether
ERRP-induced stimulation of apoptosis in the colonic mucosa of
1,2-dimethylhydrazine–treated mice could partly be attributed to
decreased activation of NF-nB; the DNA-binding activity of NF-nB
was determined by EMSA. As expected, ERRP caused a marked
inhibition of NF-nB binding activity in the colonic epithelium of
1,2-dimethylhydrazine–treated mice (Fig. 5A) and the small
intestinal tissue of Min mice (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, the DNAbinding activity of NF-nB was found to be already slightly higher in
the small intestinal mucosa of Min mice than in the C57BL6 mice

Min Mice.
To further determine the extent of the effect of the ERRP-induced
inhibition of the DNA-binding activity of NF-nB to cyclooxygenase
(COX)-2, a direct downstream target of NF-nB, whose expression is
greatly increased in colon cancer (43) was determined. It was
anticipated that ERRP-mediated regression of ACF would be
associated with a concomitant reduction in COX-2 expression.
Indeed, we observed that the levels of COX-2 in the colonic mucosa
of ERRP-treated CF1 mice were decreased by 70% to 80% (Fig. 6)
and by f40% in the small intestinal tissue of Min mice, when
compared with the corresponding controls (data not shown).

The prevalence of overexpression or constitutive activation of
EGFRs in different epithelial malignancies, including colorectal
cancer, and their effect on disease etiology have identified this
group of receptor tyrosine kinases as a prominent target for
therapeutic intervention. ERRP, a recently identified pan-erbB
inhibitor that targets multiple members of the EGFR family,
inhibits growth of several colon, pancreatic and breast cancer cells
that express varying levels of EGFRs (15). ERRP also inhibits in the
growth of SCID mice xenografts of colon or pancreatic cancer cells
(18, 19, 22). These studies suggest that ERRP could be a therapeutic
agent for a number of epithelial cancers. Our current data, for the
first time, show that ERRP treatment regresses existing carcinogeninduced ACF that represent the earliest visible changes in colon
carcinogenesis as well as spontaneously formed adenomas in Min
mice. In contrast to xenografts, these models mimic the multistage
human disease in immunocompetent mice. These results indicate a
clear therapeutic potential of ERRP for the early and intermediate
stages of colon cancer. Our current data also set ERRP apart from
other natural or endogenous compounds with preventive but not
therapeutic functions. This together with an apparent lack of side
effects identifies ERRP as a promising anticancer agent.
The mechanisms by which ERRP causes regression of ACF and
adenomas are not fully understood. Our current studies suggest a
combination of inhibition of proliferation and stimulation of
apoptosis may be the underlying mechanisms. Increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis occur early in carcinogen-treated
mucosa (35) that precedes ACF formation. Mucosal proliferation is
increased in dysplastic ACF, which may represent an important
advantage for progression of these lesions (44). Therefore, reversal
of this hyperproliferation may be critical for the regression of ACF.
This is not specific for the carcinogen induced colon cancer model
because increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis have also
been shown in the normal appearing intestinal mucosa of Min
mice (33). Our current observations are in agreement with what
has been noted by Moran et al. (33). Moreover, the fact that ERRP
reverses these variables suggest that the regression of adenomas is
partly the result of reduction in mucosal proliferation and
stimulation of apoptosis.
Our previous studies have shown that ERRP-induced growth
inhibition is associated with the attenuation of constitutive and/or
ligand-induced activation of EGFRs and their subsequent signaling
pathways. A similar phenomenon was also noted in the intestinal
mucosa of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine–treated mice and Min mice after
ERRP administration. ERRP caused a marked attenuation of
constitutive activation of EGFR, ErbB-2, and ErbB-3, which could
be attributed at least for EGFR, to the down-regulation of receptor
expression. The structural similarity of ERRP with EGFR may be
important for this difference: while there is an 85% to 90%
homology to EGFR, there is only a 50% to 60% homology with
other EGFRs (14). It remains to be determined if this difference is
a time-dependent phenomenon, and whether a longer treatment
period (more than the 10 days used in the present study) would
result in down-regulation of other members of the EGFR family.
However, the overexpression of EGFR in carcinogen-treated
mucosa (29, 38), ACF (32), and Min intestinal tissue (33) suggests
that this receptor plays a crucial role in the development of colon
cancer.
The precise mechanism(s) by which ERRP attenuates activation
of EGFRs and, in turn, cell growth have not been fully delineated.

Regression of Intestinal Neoplasia by ERRP

Figure 5. EMSA showing reduction in DNA binding
activity of NF-nB activity in the (A ) colonic mucosa of
1,2-dimethylhydrazine–treated mice and (B) small
intestinal mucosa from Min mice after 10 daily injections of
ERRP or vehicle (controls).

Previously, we reported that increased activation of EGFR in the
colonic mucosa of aged or carcinogen-treated rodents was
associated with elevated levels of membrane-bound precursor
forms of TGF-a (29, 38), which was thought to be involved in
activating the intrinsic EGFR activity through an autocrine/
juxtacrine mechanism (45, 46). The substantial homology of ERRP
to the extracellular ligand–binding domain of the EGFRs allows
for sequestration of ligands, rendering them unavailable for
binding to and activation of the receptors. The absence of the
extracellular domain IV of EGFR has been suggested to increase
the affinity of ligands to the receptor (47). The same could be
true for ERRP as it also lacks the major part of the domain IV.
In support of this postulation, we have observed an increased
binding of TGF-a and HB-EGF to ERRP in ERRP-treated PC-3 cells
leading to attenuation of EGFR signaling and inhibition of growth
(21). Indeed, the attenuation of EGFR, ErbB-2, and ErbB-3
activation in the intestinal mucosa of CF1 and Min mice after
ERRP treatment could be attributed to increased sequestration of

the ligand(s) by recombinant ERRP. We have observed that the
amount of precursor forms of TGF-a bound to ERRP in intestinal
membranes from ERRP-treated mice is substantially higher than
in controls.
Numerous studies have shown that NF-nB, a transcription factor,
plays an important role in cell survival by its ability to block or
decrease apoptosis (48). Activation of EGFRs has been shown to
activate NF-nB. We predicted that attenuation of EGFRs activation
will lead to a concomitant reduction in NF-nB activity. Indeed, we
have observed that ERRP treatment for 10 days that caused an
attenuation of EGFRs activation in the intestinal mucosa was
associated with decreased NF-nB activity, as evidenced by
decreased DNA binding activity of the transcription factor. This
may partly be responsible for decreased expression of COX-2 in the
colonic mucosa of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine–treated CF1 mice.
Because NF-nB is critically involved in regulating cell survival,
the increased apoptosis by ERRP could partly be due to the
inhibition of NF-nB activity. Taken together the results suggest that
ERRP could effectively inactivate both EGFR and COX-2 and as
such could be useful for prevention and/or treatment of colon
cancer.
In summary, our current data show that ERRP is effective in
regressing ACF in the colon of CF1 mice that are formed in
response to 1,2-dimethylhydrazine treatment as well as spontaneously developed adenomas in Min mice. This is thought to be the
result of decreased activation of EGFR, ErbB-2, and ErbB-3, leading
to inhibition of NF-nB activity and, in turn, inhibition of
proliferation and stimulation of apoptosis. Based on our data, we
conclude that ERRP could be an effective therapeutic agent for
treatment of early and even advanced colon cancer.
