head and neck cancers ( for review, see ref. 5). HPV-16 E7, one of its
oncoproteins, is essential for the induction and maintenance of
cellular transformation (5). Thus, HPV-16 E7 is an ideal target for
developing vaccine and immunotherapeutic strategies for the
control of HPV infections and HPV-associated lesions ( for review,
see ref. 6). However, the antigen-specific immune responses and
antitumor effects generated by DNA vaccine encoding wild-type E7
is weak and not enough to be effective in controlling tumor growth.
To overcome the weak antigenicity of E7, we have previously
created a DNA vaccine encoding HPV-16 E7 linked to the sorting
signal of the lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1;
refs. 7–9). The encoded chimeric protein (Sig/E7/LAMP-1) also
includes the signal peptide derived from LAMP-1 protein.
Vaccination with Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA led to a significantly
enhanced E7-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell–mediated immune
responses, resulting in potent antitumor effects against E7expressing tumors in vaccinated mice (7–9).
Although antigen-specific DNA vaccines may be effective against
small tumors in preclinical models, many tumors can grow rapidly
resulting in bulky tumors, which present a challenge to immunotherapeutic strategies alone. We hypothesize that this challenge
may be overcome by multimodality treatment regimens, which
combine immunotherapy, such as DNA vaccination, with an
apoptosis-inducing chemotherapeutic drug, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a compound found in green tea.
EGCG is the major polyphenol component found in green tea
( for reviews, see refs. 10–13). EGCG has shown antitumor effects
in various human and animal models, including cancers of the
breast, prostate, stomach, esophagus, colon, pancreas, skin,
lung, and other sites ( for reviews, see refs. 10, 14, 15). EGCG
has been shown to act on different pathways to regulate cancer
cell growth, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis ( for reviews,
see refs. 10, 11, 16). For example, some studies suggest that
EGCG protects against cancer by causing cell cycle arrest and
inducing apoptosis (17). It is also reported that telomerase
inhibition might be one of the major mechanisms underlying the
anticancer effects of EGCG (18). In comparison with commonly
used antitumor agents, including retinoids and doxorubicin,
EGCG has a relatively low toxicity and is convenient to give
due to its oral bioavailability (19, 20). Thus, EGCG has been used
in clinical trials (21) and seems to be a potentially ideal antitumor
agent (22, 23).
In the current study, we investigate whether immunotherapy
with a DNA vaccine encoding Sig/E7/LAMP-1 acts synergistically
with EGCG. The rationale was that EGCG might aid DNA vaccine–
mediated antitumor immunity by inhibiting tumor growth, thereby

Abstract
Immunotherapy and chemotherapy are generally effective
against small tumors in animal models of cancer. However,
these treatment regimens are generally ineffective against
large, bulky tumors. We have found that a multimodality
treatment regimen using DNA vaccination in combination
with chemotherapeutic agent epigallocatechin-3-gallate
(EGCG), a compound found in green tea, is effective in
inhibiting large tumor growth. EGCG was found to induce
tumor cellular apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner.
The combination of EGCG and DNA vaccination led to an
enhanced tumor-specific T-cell immune response and enhanced antitumor effects, resulting in a higher cure rate than
either immunotherapy or EGCG alone. In addition, combined
DNA vaccination and oral EGCG treatment provided longterm antitumor protection in cured mice. Cured animals
rejected a challenge of E7-expressing tumors, such as TC-1 and
B16E7, but not a challenge of B16 7 weeks after the combined
treatment, showing antigen-specific immune responses. These
results suggest that multimodality treatment strategies, such
as combining immunotherapy with a tumor-killing cancer
drug, may be a more effective anticancer strategy than singlemodality treatments. [Cancer Res 2007;67(2):802–11]

Introduction
Multimodality treatments that combine conventional cancer
therapies with immunotherapy, such as DNA vaccines, have
emerged as a potentially plausible approach in the fight against
cancer ( for reviews, see refs. 1, 2). We have developed DNA vaccine
systems for human papillomavirus (HPV)–associated cervical
neoplasia and HPV-associated head and neck cancers ( for review,
see refs. 3, 4). Cervical cancer can serve as a model of how a viral
infection can progress through a multistep process from initial
infection to premalignant dysplasia, called cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia, to invasive cancer. HPV, particularly HPV-16, is
associated with a majority of cervical cancers and a subset of

EGCG Enhances Antitumor Immunity via DNA Vaccines
MHC class II epitope (amino acids 30–67) for detecting E7-specific
CD4+ T-cell precursors (7). Intracellular interleukin-4 (IL-4) and
IFN-g staining and flow cytometric analysis were done as described
previously (26). Analyses were done on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan
with CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry System,
Mountain View, CA).
In vivo tumor growth experiments. In vivo tumor growth experiments
were done in tumor-challenged mice treated with EGCG at various
concentrations. C57BL/6 mice ( five per group) were injected s.c. in the right
leg with 5  105 TC-1 tumor cells per mouse. Ten days after tumor
inoculation, EGCG was given in the drinking water at a concentration of
0, 0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 mg/mL for 5 days. The TC-1 tumor–challenged mice were
characterized for tumor growth by measuring the tumor volume 1 week
after the termination of EGCG treatment.
For in vivo tumor protection experiments, C57BL/6 mice ( five per group)
were vaccinated and received a booster with the Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA or
control DNA via gene gun and challenged with 5  105 TC-1 tumor cells per
mouse s.c. in the right leg 3 days after the initial vaccination. EGCG (Sigma
Chemical) was given in the drinking water of animals at various
concentrations (0, 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 mg/mL) at the time of tumor
challenge and continued for 11 days. Mice were monitored for evidence of
tumor growth by measuring the tumor volume at 14 days after tumor
challenge. In another set of tumor protection experiments, EGCG was given
in the drinking water of animals at the concentration of 0.5 mg/mL at the
time of tumor challenge and continued for 11 days. Treated mice were
monitored for evidence of tumor growth by inspection and palpation twice
a week.
For the characterization of the subsets of lymphocytes important for the
antitumor effects, C57BL/6 mice ( five per group) were vaccinated and
received a booster with the Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA via gene gun and were
subsequently challenged with TC-1 tumor cells 3 days after initial
vaccination. EGCG was provided in the drinking water at a concentration
of 0.5 mg/mL at the time of tumor challenge and continued for 11 days.
Antibody depletion of subsets of lymphocytes was initiated 1 week after the
last immunization using the methods described previously (24). MAb GK1.5
was used for CD4 depletion; MAb 2.43 was used for CD8 depletion; and MAb
PK136 was used for NK1.1 depletion. Depletion was terminated on day 40
after tumor challenge. Mice were monitored for evidence of tumor growth
by inspection and palpation twice a week.
For long-term tumor protection experiments, C57BL/6 mice ( five per
group) were vaccinated and received a booster with Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA
via gene gun. Three days after the initial vaccination, the mice were s.c.
challenged with 5  105 TC-1 tumor cells per mouse in the right leg. EGCG
(Sigma Chemical) was given in the drinking water of animals at a dose of
0.5 mg/mL at the time of tumor challenge and continued for 11 days. Seven
weeks after the last vaccination, the mice were injected with TC-1, B-16, or
B16-E7 at a dose of 5  104 tumor cells per mouse via tail vein to simulate
hematogenous spread of tumors and evaluate long-term protection. Mice
were sacrificed 24 days after tumor challenge and assayed for tumor growth
in the lung.
For the tumor treatment experiments, mice were challenged with 1  104
TC-1 tumor cells per mouse s.c. Three days later, the mice were vaccinated
with Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA and received a booster with the same DNA via
gene gun 1 week later. EGCG was given in the drinking water at a
concentration of 0.5 mg/mL at the time of initial DNA treatment and
continued for 14 days. Tumor volumes were measured and recorded twice a
week for 78 days following tumor challenge. In vivo tumor experiments were
done thrice to generate reproducible data.
Statistical analysis. All data are expressed as means F SD and are
representative of at least two separate experiments. Results for intracellular
cytokine staining with flow cytometry analysis, and tumor treatment
experiments were evaluated by ANOVA. Comparisons between individual
data points were made using Student’s t test. In the tumor protection
experiments, the principal outcome measure was time to tumor
development. The event time distributions for different mice were
compared using the Kaplan and Meier method and the log-rank statistic.
All Ps < 0.05 were considered significant.

allowing time for the antitumor immune response to develop. We
observed that chemotherapy with EGCG led to increased apoptotic
tumor cell death. Our data showed a dramatic increase in
E7-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell–mediated immune responses
after combining Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA vaccination with oral
administration of EGCG in drinking water. Thus, combination of
cancer immunotherapy with a tumor-killing cancer drug may be a
plausible approach for the control of bulky tumors. The clinical
implications of our study are discussed.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Six- to 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from
Daehan Biolink (Chungbuk, Korea). All animal procedures were done
according to approved protocols and in accordance with recommendations
for the proper use and care of laboratory animals.
Tumor models. Three cell lines of H-2b background (TC-1, B16, and
B16E7) were used as murine tumor models. The HPV-16 E7-expressing
murine tumor model (TC-1) has been described previously (24). In brief,
HPV-16 E6, E7, and ras oncogene were used to transform primary C57BL/6
mice lung epithelial cells to generate the TC-1 cell line. The generation of a
B16 melanoma cell line expressing HPV-16 E7 antigen, referred to as B16E7,
has been previously described (25). These cell lines were cultured in vitro in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/mL
penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate,
and 2 mmol/L nonessential amino acids and grown at 37jC with 5% CO2.
DNA vaccination. The generation and purification of pcDNA3-Sig/E7/
LAMP-1 has been described previously (8). DNA-coated gold particles were
prepared according to a previously described protocol (26). DNA-coated
gold particles were delivered to the shaved abdominal region of mice using
a helium-driven gene gun (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with a discharge pressure
of 400 p.s.i. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with 2 Ag of a plasmid encoding
Sig/E7/LAMP-1 or a control plasmid with no insert. The mice received a
booster with the same dose 7 days later.
Determination of apoptotic cells in tumors. C57BL/6 mice ( five per
group) were injected s.c. in the right leg with 5  105 TC-1 tumor cells per
mouse. Ten days later, EGCG (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was given
in the drinking water at a concentration of 0, 0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 mg/mL for
5 days. After emulsifying the isolated tumors into single-cell preparations,
detection of apoptotic cells was done using phycoerythrin-conjugated
rabbit anti-active caspase-3 antibody (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To characterize the
expression of HPV-16 E7 in TC-1 cells, single-cell suspensions of isolated
tumors were stained with E7-specific monoclonal antibody, which was
kindly provided by Dr. Ju-Hong Jeon (Seoul National University College of
Medicine; ref. 27). The percentage of apoptotic cells was analyzed using
flow cytometry.
Activation of an E7-specific CD8+ T-cell line by CD11c+-enriched
cells from vaccinated mice. Ten days after tumor inoculation, tumorbearing mice were given EGCG in their drinking water at a concentration
of 0 or 0.5 mg/mL for 5 days. Inguinal lymph nodes were then harvested
from treated mice, and CD11c+ cells were enriched from a single-cell
suspension of isolated inguinal lymph nodes using CD11c (N418) microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Enriched CD11c+ cells were analyzed by
forward and side scatter and gated around a population of cells with size
and granular characteristics of dendritic cells. The isolated CD11c+
dendritic cells (2  104) were incubated with 2  106 E7-specific CD8+ T
cells for 16 h. Cells were then stained for both surface CD8 and intracellular
IFN-g and analyzed by flow cytometry (8).
Intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry analysis.
Splenocytes were harvested from the Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA and/or EGCGtreated mice ( five per group) 7 days after the last vaccination. Before
intracellular cytokine staining, 4  106 pooled splenocytes from each
vaccination group were incubated overnight with 1 Ag/mL of E7 peptide
containing either an MHC class I epitope (amino acids 49–57) for detecting
E7-specific CD8+ T-cell precursors, or 5 Ag/mL of E7 peptide containing an

Results
Treatment with EGCG induced apoptotic cell death of
tumors, generated HPV-16 E7-specific CD8+ T cells, and
inhibited tumor growth of E7-expressing tumors. We measured
the percentage of apoptotic tumor cells and antigen presentation
in the draining lymph nodes after EGCG administration in mice
with established tumors. Mice were s.c. inoculated with 5  105
TC-1 tumor cells per mouse. TC-1 is a previously described E7expressing tumor model (24). Ten days after tumor inoculation,
EGCG was given for 5 days in the drinking water at a concentration
of 0, 0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 mg/mL. After preparation of single-cell
suspensions of isolated tumors, detection of apoptotic cells was
done using phycoerythrin-conjugated rabbit anti-active caspase-3
antibody, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To identify
TC-1 cells, single-cell suspensions of the tumor were also stained
with E7-specific monoclonal antibody. The percentage of apoptotic
tumor cells was analyzed using flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1A
and B, tumors of mice treated with EGCG showed dose-dependent
apoptosis. There was an increased percentage of tumor cell
apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner of given EGCG. In fact,
there was a >11-fold increase in the percentage of apoptosis in TC1 tumors in mice treated with 2.5 mg/mL EGCG in the drinking
water compared with mice treated with 0 mg/mL EGCG (3.41%
versus 0.29%). To determine whether EGCG-induced apoptosis
leads to a decrease in the tumor volume, tumor-bearing mice were
treated with EGCG as described above, and tumor volume was
measured 1 week after the termination of ECGC treatment. As
shown in Fig. 1C, there was a correlative decrease in tumor volume
as EGCG concentrations increased from 0 to 0.5 mg/mL. However,
at the highest dose of EGCG (2.5 mg/mL), there was a relative
increase in tumor volume compared with the 0.5 mg/mL dose.
Furthermore, we measured the E7-specific CD8+ T-cell immune
response in tumor-bearing mice treated with various concentrations of EGCG. As shown in Fig. 1D, there was an observed
increase in the number of E7-specific CD8+ T cells in a dosedependent manner of EGCG given at doses ranging from 0 to
0.5 mg/mL. However, the number of E7-specific CD8+ T cells
decreased when EGCG was given at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL,
which correlated with the increased tumor volume observed at this
concentration as shown in Fig. 1C. These results indicate that
tumor cell apoptosis occurs in a linear relationship with the dose of
EGCG given. Furthermore, immune cell responses and antitumor
effects correlate with increasing doses of EGCG given at a certain
dose range (0–0.5 mg/mL). However, when EGCG is given at
the highest dose of 2.5 mg/mL, there seems to be a decrease in
E7-specific immune responses and a decrease in the observed
antitumor effect. Our data suggest that at higher doses of EGCG,
the enhancement of antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell immune
responses mediated by induced tumor cell apoptosis may be
countered by the potential immunosuppressive effects of EGCG on
the immune system.
Treatment with EGCG generated higher levels of antigenloaded dendritic cells in the draining lymph nodes of tumorbearing mice. To determine whether apoptosis increased antigen
cross-presentation in draining lymph nodes, tumor-bearing mice
were treated with EGCG in the drinking water at a concentration of
0.5 mg/mL, as described in Fig. 1A and B. The selection of the
EGCG dose at the concentration of 0.5 mg/mL was based on the
observed findings from Fig. 1C and D. After EGCG treatment,
inguinal lymph nodes were harvested. CD11c+ cells were enriched

The TC-1 tumor–challenged mice were characterized for tumor growth by
measuring the tumor volume. The HPV-16 E7-specific CD8+ T-cell immune
responses in treated mice were characterized by intracellular cytokine staining

effective in stimulating E7-specific CD8+ T cells to secrete IFN-g,

generated higher levels of E7 peptide–

the absence of tumor, the HPV-16 E7-specific CD8+ T-cell
immune responses in vaccinated mice continued to decrease
with the increasing amount of EGCG given orally. Taken together,
these data indicated that the enhanced antigen-specific CD8+
T-cell immune responses observed by the DNA vaccine in
combination with EGCG are only observed in the presence of
tumor and are likely due to increased tumor cell apoptosis mediated
by EGCG.
Levels of E7-specific CD8+ T-cell immune responses and
antitumor effects against E7-expressing tumors are related to
the dose of EGCG given. We further determined if the doses of
EGCG treatment affects the generation of E7-specific CD8+ T cell–
mediated immunity and antitumor effects in tumor-challenged
mice. C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated and received a booster with
the Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA or a DNA vector without insert and were
subsequently challenged with TC-1 tumor cells 3 days after initial
vaccination. EGCG was provided at various concentrations,
specifically 0, 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 mg/mL, at the time of tumor
challenge and continued for 11 days. Antigen-specific immune
responses and tumor volume were measured 14 days after TC-1
challenge. As shown in Fig. 4A, the E7-specific CD8+ T-cell immune
responses increased in a dose-dependent manner with the
concentration of EGCG, at a dose range of 0 to 0.5 mg/mL in
mice immunized with Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA vaccine. However,
EGCG treatment at 2.5 mg/mL dramatically decreased the number
of E7-specific CD8+ T cells compared with mice treated with EGCG
at a dose of 0.5 mg/mL. Mice immunized with a DNA containing no
insert failed to generate any significant levels of E7-specific CD8+
T-cell immunity at any of the tested concentrations. Similarly,
tumor volume decreased in a dose-dependent manner with the
concentration of EGCG in mice vaccinated with Sig/E7/LAMP-1
DNA (Fig. 4B). However, the tumor volume of the DNA-vaccinated
mice treated with 2.5 mg/mL of EGCG was significantly larger
than those mice treated with 0.5 mg/mL of EGCG. Taken together,
in the presence of tumor, the antigen-specific immune responses
and antitumor effects in DNA-vaccinated, EGCG-treated mice were

with EGCG. These effects are antigen specific as shown by the lack
of response observed in mice bearing a non–E7-expressing tumor
B16. These results show that tumor-bearing mice treated with
EGCG generate higher levels of antigen-loaded dendritic cells in
draining lymph nodes, which are able to activate antigen-specific
CD8+ T-cell immune responses.
Combined DNA vaccination and EGCG treatment generated
an enhanced E7-specific CD8+ T-cell immune response
compared with monotherapy alone. We tested the ability of a
combined strategy of DNA vaccination and EGCG treatment to
generate E7-specific CD8+ T-cell immune responses. Mice were
inoculated with 1  104 TC-1 tumor cells per mouse s.c. Three days
later, the mice were vaccinated with Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA or a
control DNA without any insert. EGCG was given in the drinking
water at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL at the time of vaccination
and continued for 14 days. We assessed the E7-specific CD8+ T-cell
immune response in the mice treated as described above. As shown
in Fig. 3A and B, the combination treatment with Sig/E7/LAMP-1
DNA and EGCG resulted in a robust increase in the number of IFNg–secreting E7-specific CD8+ T-cell precursors compared with
single therapy with Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA alone (at least a 6.5-fold
increase) or EGCG treatment alone. Thus, our data show that a
combination of Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA vaccine with orally given
EGCG can significantly enhance tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell
immune responses.
To determine whether EGCG treatment affects the generation
of E7-specific CD8+ T cell–mediated immunity in DNA-vaccinated
mice in the absence of tumor, we vaccinated C57BL/6 mice with
the Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA intradermally and received a booster
with the same DNA vaccine at the same dose via gene gun 1
week later. EGCG was given in the drinking water at various
concentrations ranging from 0, 0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 mg/mL at the time
of vaccination and continued for 14 days. HPV-16 E7-specific
CD8+ T-cell immune responses in treated mice were characterized by intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry
analysis 14 days after DNA vaccination. As shown in Fig. 3C, in

that CD8+ T cells are essential for the antitumor effects generated
by the combined therapy.
Combined DNA vaccination and EGCG treatment generated
an enhanced Th1 E7-specific CD4+ T-cell immune response.
The ability of the Sig/E7/LAMP-1 targeting strategy to enhance
antigen presentation to CD4+ T lymphocytes is achieved by
targeting the expressed antigen to endosomal/lysosomal compartments and subsequently to the MHC class II antigen presentation
pathway. To determine the nature of the E7-specific CD4+ T-cell
response to the combined treatment with Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA
vaccination and oral EGCG administration, we did intracellular
cytokine staining for IFN-g (secreted by Th1 cells) or IL-4
(secreted by Th2 cells) using flow cytometry analysis. C57BL/6
mice ( five per group) were inoculated with TC-1 tumor cells s.c.
Three days later, the mice were treated with either the Sig/E7/
LAMP-1 DNA vaccine or a control DNA containing no insert.
Mice received a booster of Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA or control DNA 7
days after the first vaccination. Oral EGCG treatment (0.5 mg/mL)
was initiated at the time of DNA vaccination and continued for
14 days. Vaccination with Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA combined with
EGCG administration generated significantly higher levels of
E7-specific Th1 CD4+ T lymphocytes than vaccination with Sig/
E7/LAMP-1 alone or EGCG treatment alone. In contrast, there
was only a slight increase in E7-specific Th2 CD4+ T lymphocytes
(Supplementary Fig. S1). These data suggest that the combination of Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA vaccination with oral EGCG treatment may contribute to an enhanced E7-specific CD4+ Th1 cell
response.
Combined DNA vaccination and EGCG treatment generated
significant long-term immune response and antitumor protection in treated mice. Ideally, a successful cancer treatment
must be capable of generating effective long-term protection.

enhanced at certain dose ranges of EGCG, and at higher doses of
EGCG, the benefits of its antitumor effects may be countered by the
potential immunosuppressive effects of EGCG on the immune
system.
Antibody depletion experiments showed that CD8+ T cells
were important for the antitumor effects generated by the
combined therapy. We also characterized the antitumor effects
generated by immunization with the Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA vaccine
or an empty DNA vector in the presence or absence of EGCG
administration at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Mice were
vaccinated with the DNA vaccine and were subsequently
challenged 3 days later with TC-1 tumor cells. Mice were then
given plain drinking water or drinking water containing EGCG at
the time of tumor challenge and continued for 11 days. Tumor
growth was monitored twice a week by inspection and palpation.
As shown in Fig. 4C, only the mice receiving the combined
therapy with DNA vaccine and EGCG had tumor regression
within 20 days after tumor challenge. All of the mice receiving
Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA in combination with EGCG remained
tumor-free 42 days after TC-1 tumor challenge. In contrast, all
of the mice treated with Sig/E7/LAMP-1 or EGCG alone
continued to show tumor growth.
To determine the subset of lymphocytes that are important for
the antitumor effects generated by combined therapy, we did
in vivo antibody depletion experiments in mice that were
challenged with TC-1 tumors and treated with Sig/E7/LAMP-1
DNA vaccine in combination with EGCG at a concentration of
0.5 mg/mL. As shown in Fig. 4D, all of the mice depleted of CD8+
T cells did not show tumor regression. In comparison, all of the
mice depleted of natural killer cells showed tumor regression
similar to mice without antibody depletion. Eighty percent of mice
depleted of CD4 cells showed tumor regression. These data suggest

EGCG Enhances Antitumor Immunity via DNA Vaccines

Figure 4. Characterization of E7-specific CD8+ T-cell immune responses and antitumor effects generated by the Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA vaccine combined with EGCG.
C57BL/6 mice (five per group for all of the studies) were vaccinated and received a booster with the Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA (solid columns ) or a control DNA containing no
insert (open columns ) and were subsequently challenged with TC-1 tumor cells s.c. 3 d after initial vaccination. A and B, EGCG of various concentrations
was provided in the drinking water, ranging from 0 to 2.5 mg/mL at the time of tumor challenge and continued for 11 d. C and D, EGCG was provided in the drinking
water at the concentration of 0.5 mg/mL at the time of tumor challenge and continued for 11 d. A, intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-g followed by flow cytometry

generates a strong long-term antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell immune
response with excellent long-term protective antitumor effects.
Combined DNA vaccination and EGCG treatment generated synergistic antitumor therapeutic effects than monotherapy alone. For the tumor treatment experiments, mice were
inoculated with 1  104 TC-1 tumor cells per mouse s.c. Three
days later, mice were vaccinated with Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA. EGCG
was given in the drinking water at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL
at the start of the vaccination and continued for 14 days. Tumor
volumes were measured and recorded twice per week for 8 weeks
following immunization. We found that the tumors in mice
treated with the combined cancer therapy remained the smallest
in size (Fig. 6). This indicates that the combined strategy of DNA
vaccination and oral EGCG treatment results in greater locoregional control of tumor than monotherapy alone in the TC-1
model.

Therefore, we assessed the ability of our combined therapy to
generate long-term E7-specific CD8+ T-cell immune responses and
protective antitumor effects. Intracellular cytokine staining was
followed by flow cytometry analysis to identify E7-specific CD8+
T cells 1 and 7 weeks after the last immunization of the mice,
which did not had evidence of tumor growth following the TC-1
tumor challenge. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, significant levels of the
E7-specific IFN-g CD8+ T lymphocyte response generated by the
combined therapy were still present up to 7 weeks after
immunization. All of the mice remained tumor-free.
To determine the long-term tumor protective ability of our
vaccination strategy, we re-challenged the tumor-free mice i.v. with
5  104 TC-1 tumor cells 7 weeks after the final immunization. As
shown in Fig. 5C, the naive mice exhibited 151.6 F 42.3 tumor
nodules 42 days after TC-1 challenge, whereas the mice treated
with the Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA vaccine and oral EGCG treatment
exhibited no pulmonary tumor nodules. Thus, in a tumor
protection experiment, the combined therapy successfully prevented tumor nodule formation up to 7 weeks after vaccination.
This long-term antitumor immunity was highly E7 specific because
vaccinated mice were not protected from a non–E7-expressing
tumor model B16. In comparison, an E7 antigen-expressing B16
tumor cell line (B16E7) failed to form a high number of tumor
nodules in the vaccinated mice. Taken together, these data indicate
that DNA vaccination combined with oral EGCG treatment

Discussion
Administration of highly cytotoxic cancer drugs has severe
adverse side effects and causes discomfort for cancer patients.
These highly toxic drugs also limit host immune reactions against
cancers. In this study, we have shown that oral administration
of a low-toxic cancer drug EGCG resulted in complete tumor
regression in mice vaccinated with Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA vaccine,

EGCG alone failed to increase the number of E7-specific CD8+
T cells generated by Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA vaccine in mice not
bearing TC-1 tumors (see Fig. 3C). From these data, we propose
that EGCG treatment may augment the antitumor immunity
induced by genetic vaccination through enhanced tumor cell
death, resulting in increased uptake of tumor antigens by antigen
processing cells, such as dendritic cells, and enhanced antigen
presentation in draining lymph nodes, which can then activate
CD8+ T cells ( for review, see refs. 28, 29). There is increasing
evidence that the tumor antigens phagocytosed by bone
marrow–derived dendritic cells are introduced not only into
the MHC class II but also into the class I processing pathway to
cross-prime naive T cells for development of potent immunity
(30–32). Our data are consistent with this notion. Oral EGCG
administration increased the percentage of apoptotic tumor cells
and tumor-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in a dose-dependent
manner up to certain level of EGCG concentration (0.5 mg/mL).
Thus, these data provide direct evidence of how, after chemotherapy, the increased number of dying tumor cells led to more
tumor antigen-loaded CD11c+ dendritic cells in draining lymph

without any severe systemic toxicity, such as loss of hair, weight,
or lymphopenia. Importantly, this combined therapeutic strategy
generated stronger tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cell immune
responses, when compared with mice immunized with DNA
vaccine alone. In addition, combined DNA vaccination and oral
EGCG treatment generated a significant long-term immune
response and protected mice from tumor growth upon repeated
tumor challenges.
Immunotherapy and chemotherapy are generally rarely curative, even in small animal models of cancer, because many of
these tumors rapidly grow to become large, bulky tumors, which
present a challenge to either treatment regimen alone. At the
start of this study, we expected that EGCG might aid DNA
vaccine–mediated antitumor effects by inhibiting tumor growth,
thereby allowing time for a curative immune response to
develop. Unexpectedly, however, we observed a dramatic increase
in E7-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity after combining DNA
vaccination with oral administration of EGCG. This does not
seem to be a direct adjuvant effect of EGCG on induction of
E7-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity because oral administration of

of inflammatory molecules, called ‘‘danger signals,’’ which are
necessary for the maturation of antigen-presenting cells, such as
dendritic cells. The apoptotic death of a tumor cell, in the
absence of inflammation, might seem as normal tissue turnover
and generate immune ignorance or tolerance against a tumor cell
( for review, see refs. 35–37). However, there is now increasing
evidence that in appropriate immunologic settings, cancer drug–
induced apoptotic death of tumor cells can trigger the generation
of effective antitumor immune responses (38–40). One such
successful demonstration has been done with cyclophosphamide.
It is known that appropriate doses of cyclophosphamide help to
generate strong immune priming after immunotherapy by
depleting regulatory T cells from animals bearing tolerogenic
tumors (41, 42).
Although sufficient numbers of tumor antigens are present
within apoptotic tumor cells, their ability to induce a CTL
response in the host may not be sufficient to cause rejection of
the tumor as observed in our study using EGCG alone as a
cancer drug. Under our experimental conditions, only weak
E7-specific T-cell immunity was shown in mice bearing tumors
that were treated with only EGCG, and dramatic regressions of
the tumors did not occur (see Fig. 1). Only in the setting of
combined DNA vaccination with EGCG treatment did we observe
enhanced E7-specific immune responses and antitumor therapeutic effects. One possible explanation for this observation is
that EGCG induces tumor apoptosis, resulting in uptake of tumor
antigen by professional antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic
cells, and cross-presentation in tumor-bearing mice. Dendritic
cells play a critical role in priming and boosting adaptive
immune responses. A number of investigators have shown that
dendritic cells pulsed with tumor antigens induced cytokine
production, enhanced proliferation of T cells in lymphoid tissues,
and increased tumor infiltration by activated T cells (43–45).
However, these strategies require ex vivo manipulation of
dendritic cell and thus often are time and labor intensive. The
combined therapy we propose in this study might be a promising
approach for providing tumor-specific antigens to dendritic cells
in draining lymph nodes for the enhancement of immune
responses induced by vaccination.
We strongly believe that the results in the present study have
great clinical implications. Because there are well-established
effective chemotherapy protocols for controlling the rate of tumor
growth and causing tumor cells to undergo apoptosis, immunotherapy might be used synergistically with chemotherapy for
enhancing antitumor activity. Based on the fact that complete
tumor regression and long-lasting tumor immunity were observed
in this present study, we suggest that this same strategy could be
applied to the treatment of other tumors using various immunotherapy models combined with effective cancer drugs. We have also
tested a classic cytotoxic agent, such as cisplatin, in conjunction
with DNA vaccination and have found that the combination of
DNA vaccines with cisplatin also generated therapeutic effects in
the control of TC-1 tumors compared with monotherapy alone.9
The efficacy of immuno-chemotherapy for cancer has often been
limited by the toxicity of the cancer drugs. We predict that local
treatment of tumors using other efficient cancer treatments, such
as radiotherapy ( for review, see ref. 46), antiangiogenesis agents

Figure 6. Combined DNA vaccination and oral EGCG treatment generated
synergistic antitumor therapeutic effects compared with monotherapy alone.
For the tumor treatment experiments, C57BL/6 mice (five per group) were
inoculated s.c. with 1  104 TC-1 tumor cells per mouse. Three days after tumor
inoculation, mice were vaccinated with Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA. Mice received
a booster of Sig/E7/LAMP-1 DNA vaccine with the same dose and regimen
7 d after the first vaccination. EGCG was given in the drinking water at a
concentration of 0.5 mg/mL at the start of the vaccination and continued for
14 d. Tumor volumes were measured and recorded twice per week for 8 wks
following immunization. Tumor treatment experiments were done thrice to
generate reproducible data.

nodes, resulting in increased tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells
through cross-presentation.
Chemotherapy and immunotherapy have often been regarded
as mutually exclusive. One of the reasons that contribute to this is
lymphopenia, a common side effect of most cancer drugs, which
has been implicated as being detrimental to the antitumor
immune response. We observed that a high dose (2.5 mg/mL) of
EGCG failed to enhance E7-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in mice
with or without TC-1 tumors (see Fig. 3C and Fig. 4A) and, on the
contrary, even decreased the antitumor effect in TC-1 tumor–
bearing mice (see Fig. 1C and Fig. 4B). This immune suppression
may be related to an immune suppressive effect on T cells (33)
and/or monocyte apoptosis (34) caused by high doses of EGCG,
as has been reported by another group. Thus, in the presence of
tumor, the antigen-specific immune responses and antitumor
effects generated by EGCG was only observed at certain dose
ranges (0.1–0.5 mg/mL). However, at higher doses of EGCG
(2.5 mg/mL), the benefits of its antitumor effects may be
countered by the potential immunosuppressive effects of EGCG
on the immune system.
Another possible reason that chemotherapy and immunotherapy have often been regarded as mutually exclusive is that
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of cancer cells has been
regarded as nonimmunogenic, or even tolerogenic, in the absence

Cancer Research

In summary, our present study shows that combined treatment
with immune-modulating doses of chemotherapy can enhance the
tumor-specific immune responses and antitumor effects induced by
DNA vaccines. These data provide an immunologic rationale for
testing various combinations of tumor vaccines with chemotherapy
in patients with cancer. Many vaccine strategies and chemical
drugs have been developed to control cancer. Considering that there
are a multitude of possible combinations, a great deal of work could
be forthcoming to evaluate combined therapy of tumor vaccines
and chemotherapy for enhancing therapeutic effectiveness.

( for review, see ref. 47), prodrug ( for review, see ref. 48) strategies,
or the use of drug delivery systems such as hydrogel-based systems
(49), may be made more effective by increasing local toxic effects
against tumors with minimal damage to host immune systems.
Before undertaking such treatments, the routes and doses of drugs
need to be optimized.
The HPV DNA vaccine described in the current study is
mainly for therapeutic purpose. The recently Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)–approved HPV vaccine is a preventive
HPV vaccine using HPV virus-like particles (VLP). Although the
HPV VLP vaccine is highly effective, it only includes four types
of HPVs (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18). Thus, the
current preventive HPV vaccine can only prevent up to 70% of
all cervical cancer ( for review, see ref. 50). Furthermore, the
preventive HPV vaccine cannot control existing HPV infections
or HPV-associated lesions. A significant population of patients is
currently suffering from HPV-associated morbidity or mortality.
Thus, development of therapeutic vaccines such as the one
reported here represents an important endeavor to complement
the limitation of the FDA-approved preventive HPV vaccine.
