ABSTRACT
Objectives: Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) develop acquired
resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs)
after tumor regression. No approved targeted therapies are currently available after
initial EGFR TKI treatment. This study investigated the efficacy of continuing EGFR
TKI therapy with local treatments for patients with NSCLC and local progression or
minimal/slow progression on TKI therapy.
Materials and Methods: Fifty-five patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR TKIs
and developed acquired resistance to the drug were included. Initial response to
target therapy, median progression free survival (PFS1), progression pattern, and
first progression site were assessed. Median progression free survival to physician
assessment progression (PFS2) and difference between PFS1 and PFS2 (PFS
difference) were also recorded.
Results and Conclusion: PFS1 was 11.2 months, PFS2 was 20.3 months, and PFS
difference was 8.3 months. Nineteen patients (34.5%) who manifested progression
received local therapy, and 16 (28.6%) underwent rebiopsy after progression with
six positive EGFR T790M mutations detected. Cox proportional hazards regression
model showed that only the first line of treatment was significantly correlated with
PFS difference. NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs could benefit
from the same TKI therapy through months to years of disease control.

(RECIST PD), [3–5] which clinically manifests as tumor
progression and symptomatic decline.
Acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs is caused
by several molecular mechanisms, including the
presence of the T790M missense mutation, MET
amplification, and transformation to small-cell
histology. [6] Currently, no approved targeted therapies
or efficient  treatments  are  available for patients upon
progression.

INTRODUCTION
Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (EGFR TKIs) are the standard of care in
EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer because of its
superior efficacy over chemotherapy. [1, 2] However,
patients who initially responded to EGFR-TKIs would
eventually present a median of 10–14 months in response
evaluation criteria in solid tumors progressive disease

RESULTS

We selected NSCLC patients with local progression
or minimal/slow progression on TKI therapy in our study.
There is ongoing benefit from the targeted therapy in
other sites of (non-progressing) disease due to continuing
suppression of sensitive clones that have not yet developed
acquired resistance. Consistent with this, patients with
EGFR-MT disease who progress often experience a
disease flare when the EGFR-TKI is discontinued, and
re-challenge of these patients with the same EGFR-TKI
after only a short time off therapy can lead to re-responses.
[7–9] In addition, treatment beyond progression of EGFRMT NSCLC with an EGFR-TKI has been associated
with improved overall survival, compared to those in
whom the TKI was permanently discontinued. [10]
Analogous benefits of continuation of trastuzumab beyond
progression have been well described in metastatic breast
cancer. [11]
This clinical phenomenon has impelled physicians
to continue TKI therapy beyond progression on EGFR
TKI agents. Ongoing prospective studies evaluate
strategies of continuation of erlotinib beyond RECIST
progression (ASPIRATION) [12] and gefitinib
combined with chemotherapy beyond RECIST
progression (IMPRESS); [13] nevertheless, results
remain inconclusive. Therefore, we designed this study
to investigate the efficacy and safety of continuation of
EGFR TKI therapy with necessary local treatments for
NSCLC patients with local progression or minimal/
slow progression on TKI therapy. The potential factors
that affect the effectiveness of this strategy were also
discussed.

Patient characteristics
From December 2010 to January 2015, patients
from the Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center with
histologically confirmed stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were
included in this study. We initially screened 261 patients
(Figure 1) with RECIST progression on EGFR TKIs,
and 55 patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria were
eventually analyzed. The clinical and molecular baseline
characteristics of the 55 patients are shown in Table 1. The
patients were composed of 23 men and 32 women, and
most of them were non-smokers (44, 80%). The tumor
pathology of the patients was all adenocarcinoma, except
for two squamous cell carcinomas. Seventeen patients
were older than 60 years. Forty-three cases (78.2%)
harbored EGFR-sensitive mutations (including 23 exon
19 deletions and 20 exon 21 L858R mutations), four cases
(7.3%) with wild type, and eight cases with unknown
mutational status (14.5%). As shown in Table  1, lung
(44/55, 80%), brain (4/55, 7.3%), and bone (4/55, 7.3%)
were the leading sites of progression. A patient
simultaneously developed brain and lung progression,
and five patients successively developed progression in
the two sites. As for local treatments (19/55, 34.5%) upon
progression, four patients (4/19, 21.1%) received lung
radiofrequency ablation after pulmonary progression,
one patient (1/19, 5.3%) received lung stereotactic
radiotherapy, and four (4/19, 26.3%) patients with pleural
effusion progression received ultrasound-guided drainage

with CNS progression, four received whole brain radiation
therapy (WBRT), one received gamma knife radiosurgery,
one sequentially received WBRT and gamma knife
radiosurgery, and one received brain metastases resection
surgery and WBRT surgery. Three of four patients
(3/4,  75%) with bone metastasis progression continued
EGFR TKI treatment with bone radiation therapy.
Sixteen patients (28.6%) had rebiopsy after
resistance at the following sites: pleural effusion
(6/16, 37.5%), lung (5/16, 31.3%), supraclavicular lymph
nodes (3/16, 18.8%), ascetic fluid (1/16, 6.3%), and brain
metastases (1/16, 6.3%). Of 16 patients, 14  (87.5%)
had their rebiopsy tissue examined by molecular tests
(Table 2), three patients underwent EGFR mutation and
MET amplification tests, and 11 patients had EGFR
mutation tests. Among these 14 EGFR mutation tests
samples, we detected six (42.9%) positive EGFR T790M
mutations with one sensitive mutation and two (14.3%)
wild types. For the two wild-type rebiopsy patients, their
rebiopsy sites were both in the lung. One patient harbored
EGFR mutation of L858R in exon 21 in lung biopsy
tissues, and the other patient had wild-type EGFR in brain
metastasis tissues; TKI therapy resulted in stable disease in

the lung for 8.25 months. One (33.3%) positive result was
detected in the MET amplification tests, and the rebiopsy
sample of this patient harbored the T790M mutation.

Survival data
Data cut-off date for follow-up was January  23,
2015, and the median follow-up duration was 20.93
months from the initial TKI therapy to physician
assessment PD (range: 8.51–81.87 months). At the
time of the data cut off, 23 patients (41.1%) exhibited
physician assessment PD and 11 (19.6%) died. The
median progression free survival (PFS1) was 11.2 months
(95% CI, 9.4–14.7 months), the median PFS2 was 20.3
months (95% CI, 17.1–24.1 months; Table 3), and the
median PFS difference was 8.3 months (95% CI, 6.4–10.2
months; Table 3). Hence, 80% of patients can further
benefit from continuation of EGFR TKI treatment for
more than 3 months. Moreover, disease control persisted
for more than 12 months in 26% of patients without
significant clinical progression.
Smoking history, gender, age, pathology, initial
TKI efficacy, TKI regimen, first line of treatment, disease
stage, and EGFR mutation status were used as variables in

univariate analysis. The results demonstrated that female
patients, patients who never smoked, and patients who
had not undergone chemotherapy before a TKI treatment
presented high possibility of achieving effective outcomes
with continued EGFR TKI monotherapy (Table 4).
The first line of treatment was significantly
correlated with PFS difference (Figure 1) under
multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model
(hazard ratio [HR] for chemotherapy vs. TKI, 2.192; 95%
CI, 1.008–4.768, P = 0.0048; Table 4)
The most common adverse event was grade
1  or  2  rash, which affected seven patients (12.7%),
whereas no grade 3 skin rash was observed. Moreover,
no dose reduction or discontinuation of TKI caused by
unbearable TKI-associated toxicity was required.

targeted therapy. According to Jackman’s definition,
[15] patients with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs
were classified under a unique patient population. These
patients had improved outcomes with continuous EGFR
TKI therapy. Moreover, approximately 80% of the
patients harbored a drug sensitivity-associated EGFR
mutation site and presented improved surgical outcomes
with cytotoxic chemotherapy. [5, 16] Even with the
development of acquired resistance, these patients
with local progression or minimal/slow progression
on TKI therapy resulted in long survival, particularly
those with the emergence of the T790M mutation,
which is correlated with improved beyond-progression
outcomes. [17]
All patients in this study continued the same
EGFR TKI treatment after progression, which probably
contributed to their effective clinical outcomes. A previous
study indicated that during the development of acquired
resistance to EGFR TKIs, all cells remained oncogene
addicted; the most common etiology of acquired resistance
was the presence of the T790M mutation in few cells,
which were only a small fraction of total alleles, and most
cells remained sensitive. [18] This theory could partly
explain the effectiveness of TKI therapy after acquired
resistance. Moreover, non-stop targeted therapy prevented
potential disease flare, which has been reported in patients
who discontinued erlotinib or gefitinib after developing
acquired resistance. [8, 9]
In 2010, a clinical definition of acquired resistance
to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC [15] was proposed for those
who responded (≥ 6 months) to initial gefitinib or
erlotinib treatment with a drug sensitivity-associated
mutation site or objective clinical benefit from treatment
with an EGFR TKI. Patients with local or minimal/slow
progression to EGFR TKI benefited from continuous
targeted treatment. The established clinical definition is
reasonable as confirmed in the present research, in which
patients with several characteristics exhibited a prolonged
PFS of 8.3 months. Moreover, long PFS1 resulted in high
PFS difference, which is consistent with the acquired
resistance definition. The only significant factor affecting
the PFS difference in multivariate Cox proportional
hazards regression model is the first line of treatment.

DISCUSSION
Patients who developed local or slow/minimal
progression (oligoprogression) after EGFR TKI
treatments present unique clinical characteristics. As no
approved targeted therapies are currently available for
patients with acquired resistance, they choose between
standard cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without EGFR
TKI continuation or enroll in clinical trials. In this
study, continuation of the same EGFR TKI therapy in
addition to necessary local therapy (including radiation,
ultrasound-guided drainage plus bleomycin injection
to thoracic cavity, and surgery) is correlated with a
median time to physician assessment progression of
21 months, thus extending disease control by more than
9 months after RECIST progression. The median time to
progression in groups choosing pemetrexed plus platinum
chemotherapy after prior EGFR TKI treatment failure
was 6.1 months. [14] Several factors contributed to the
efficacy of the treatment in patients with NSCLS with
acquired resistance to EGFR TKI (local or slow/minimal
progression); such factors include special clinical course
of acquired resistance disease, continuation of TKI therapy
for sensitive tumor cells, and potential benefits of local
treatment.

Thus, patients who did not receive chemotherapy before
EGFR-TKIs could present a high PFS difference. Hence,
patients who received chemotherapy before EGFR
TKI therapy exhibit poor performance at the initiation
of targeted therapy, resulting in low PFS1 and PFS
differences.
Genomic analysis comparison of rebiopsy
and primary tumor samples is shown in Table 4. In
14  patients who underwent rebiopsy and T790M
mutation test after resistance, the frequency of EGFR
T790M mutation was 42.9%, which is consistent with
a previous report. [17] One (33.3%) positive MET
amplification case was found in three tested samples,
which could be attributed to limited test cases. No
small-cell histologic transformation was detected in the
rebiopsy tumor samples. Rebiopsy after development of
acquired resistance and genomic analysis of progression
sites should be included in routine work because they
may provide useful information for tailoring subsequent
treatment strategies.
In conclusion, this study showed that continuation
of EGFR TKI therapy with necessary local therapy
or treatment can be used as a management option for
patients who developed oligoprogression during EGFR
TKI therapy. Patients with acquired resistance to EGFR
TKIs presented a unique clinical course and could
benefit from continuation of EGFR TKI treatment,
resulting in months to years of disease control and
tolerance. However, this study was limited by the small

number of enrolled patients and inconclusive overall
survival data. A prospective multicenter evaluation
of continuation of EGFR-TKI treatment must be
performed on patients who developed local or minimal/
slow progression according to the type of resistance
mechanisms.

PATIENTS AND METHOD
Patient eligibility
Patients with lung cancer who developed acquired
resistance to EGFR TKI with documented slow or
local progression after TKI therapy and would continue
single-agent EGFR TKI until physician assessment PD
were enrolled in this study. Physician assessment PD
was defined as symptomatic progression and/or multiple
progression (≥ four sites of extracranial progression)
and/or vital organ progression. Patients may undergo
necessary local therapy or treatment (radiation therapy,
radiofrequency ablation, gamma knife radiosurgery,
or ultrasound-guided drainage plus bleomycin injection to
the thoracic cavity) for a site of progressive disease.
As some patients currently do not have their tumor
EGFR mutation status determined before starting on
EGFR TKI, the following criteria were used to screen
patients who may benefit from the continuation of
TKI according to the Jackman’s definition of acquired
resistance: [15]

acquired resistance. Outcomes of interest included time to
RECIST PD, time to physician assessment PD, and overall
survival from time of acquired resistance. Nonsmokers

Response assessment and toxicity evaluation
In our institute, a RECIST evaluating committee
comprising experienced radiologists evaluated tumor
shrinkage or progression. The date of progression was
defined based on routine surveillance imaging (every
2 to 3 months) and/or symptomatic progression leading
to earlier radiographic evaluation using the version of
RECIST 1.1. Adverse events were graded according to
the modified 4.0 version of the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria.

Statistical analysis
Initial PFS1 was defined as the interval between
the beginning of EGFR-TKI and the RECIST progression
time. PFS2 was defined from the start of TKI treatment
to the date at which physician assessment progression
or death was noted. PFS difference was defined as the
difference between PFS1 and PFS2. PFS was analyzed
by Kaplan–Meier method, and log-rank test was used
to compare the difference within different groups.
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model
was used to evaluate independent predictive factors
associated with PFS difference. A two-sided P value of
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All
