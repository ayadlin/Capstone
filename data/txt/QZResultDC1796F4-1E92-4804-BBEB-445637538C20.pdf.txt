Abstract
Tetracyclines, a class of antibiotics that target bacterial translation, are commonly used in research for inducible gene expression using Tet-ON/Tet-OFF systems. However, such tetracyclineinducible systems carry a risk. Given that mitochondria have a
"bacterial" ancestry, these antibiotics also target mitochondrial
translation and impair mitochondrial function. Indeed, treatment
with doxycycline—a tetracycline derivative—disturbs mitochondrial proteostasis and metabolic activity, and induces widespread
gene-expression changes. Together, this affects physiology in wellestablished model systems ranging from cultured cells to simple
organisms and to mice and plants. These changes are observed
with doxycycline doses that are widely used to regulate gene

expression. In light of these ﬁndings, and bearing in mind the
conserved role of mitochondria in metabolism and whole organism homeostasis, we caution against the use of tetracyclines in
experimental approaches. The use of newly developed tetracycline-based systems that are more sensitive could be an alternative; however, even if no overt mitochondrial toxicity is detected,
widespread changes in gene expression may sensitize cells to the
intended tetracycline-controlled loss or gain of function, thereby
introducing a "two-hit model." This is highly relevant for cancer
research, as mitochondrial metabolism holds a central position in
the reallocation of nutrients for biomass production known as the
Warburg effect. Cancer Res; 75(21); 4446–9. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

Mitochondria as Bacteria in Our Cells

Mitochondria are at the core of cellular metabolism, as they
participate in the ﬁnal breakdown of nutrients and produce ATP
after a series of oxidation reactions that take place in the mitochondrial subcompartments. Next to their vital metabolic role,
they are also involved in many other important processes of the
cell, such as calcium homeostasis, apoptosis, and intracellular
signaling (1). Considering the versatile functions of mitochondria, it is no surprise that dysfunction of these organelles can lead
to manifestation of different diseases affecting various tissues and
with symptoms of ranging severity that can even be life-threatening (2). In recent years, mitochondrial dysfunction has also
been implicated in multifactorial age-related diseases such as
diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and cancer. Consequently,
there has been an ever-growing interest in mitochondria as targets
for pharmacologic interventions (3).

An important feature of mitochondria, which is reﬂected in
both its unique ultrastructure and physiology, is its eubacterial
ancestry. Mitochondria are derived from the endosymbiosis of an
a-proteobacterium with a host amitochondriate cell, an event that
is considered to have given rise to the modern eukaryotic cell (4).
Throughout evolution, most of the endosymbiont's genome was
transferred to the nucleus of the host cell, but mitochondria still
harbor remnants of the ancestral bacterial genome and have
retained their own transcriptional and translational machinery.
Mitochondria contain several copies of this circular doublestranded molecule (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA) that encodes
for 13 core subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
complexes and for speciﬁc mitochondrial tRNAs and rRNAs (3).
Because all other mitochondrial proteins—including the remainder of the OXPHOS subunits—are encoded by nuclear DNA
(nDNA), the stoichiometric balance between both genomes is
tightly regulated (5). Disruption of this balance, a state we
previously termed mitonuclear protein imbalance, occurs when
either the nuclear or the mitochondrial protein synthesis is
perturbed. Such imbalance leads to the activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), an adaptive stress–
response pathway working to restore protein homeostasis within
the mitochondrial matrix (6, 7). Moderate mitochondrial dysfunction and UPRmt activation is beneﬁcial as it allows mitochondria to recuperate, whereas prolonged mitochondrial stress can
ignite more terminal responses, including apoptosis. For example,
RNAi-mediated knockdown of nDNA-encoded OXPHOS protein
subunits led to UPRmt activation and lifespan extension in both
fruit ﬂies and the nematode C. elegans (8, 9). Similar effects were
observed after inhibiting mtDNA replication and transcription

The Adverse Effects of Tetracyclines in Cancer Research

with ethidium bromide treatment or after attenuation of mitochondrial translation by knockdown of components of the mitoribosome in C. elegans (5, 10). On the other hand, pathogenic
mutations in these pathways are linked to severe disorders that
often present in infancy (2), emphasizing the delicate intergenomic balance.
Given the "bacterial" origin of mitochondria, it is not surprising
that antibiotics targeting bacterial translation—such as tetracyclines and chloramphenicol—can also inhibit mitochondrial
translation (11). Indeed, similar to RNAi-mediated downregulation of the mitochondrial translational machinery, treatment with
doxycycline—an antibiotic belonging to the family of tetracyclines—induced mitonuclear protein imbalance, impaired mitochondrial respiration, activated UPRmt, and dose dependently
extended the nematode lifespan (5). Similar effects on mitochondrial function and proteostasis were observed in tissues of mice
fed with doxycycline, as well as in human and murine cell–based
models, where doxycycline reduced mitochondrial respiration
and induced UPRmt (5, 12).
On an organismal level, doxycycline proved beneﬁcial on some
physiologic aspects, as it increased motility in worms and ﬂies,
and extended the lifespan of worms (5, 12). At the same time,

however, both doxycycline-treated models presented with developmental delay and physiologic impairment related to body size
and fecundity (12). Even plants (Arabidopsis thaliana) treated with
doxycycline displayed marked growth retardation, whereas on a
molecular level they presented with mitochondrial dysfunction
and activated UPRmt (12). These ﬁndings underscore the
immense effects of doxycycline on mitochondrial function and
whole-body physiology through a mechanism that is conserved
from plants and invertebrates to mice and humans (Fig. 1).

Mitochondria in Cancer
Accumulating evidence suggests that functional mitochondria
are essential for cancer cell survival and proliferation. The emerging role of mitochondrial bioenergetics, biogenesis, and signaling
pathways on tumorigenesis has drawn the attention to the organelle's function as a potentially fruitful ﬁeld for cancer therapy
development. Tumor cells have in essence an opposite metabolic
proﬁle from that of normal cells in differentiated tissues. In the
mid-1920s, Otto Warburg observed that cancer cells produce large
quantities of lactate even in the presence of ample oxygen, a state
he termed "aerobic glycolysis" (13). We now know that increased

What is often overlooked, however, is
the fact that doxycycline inhibits not
only bacterial but also mitochondrial
translation, altering mitochondrial
metabolism. The combined effects of
tetracycline antibiotics have a major
impact on organismal physiology.

glycolytic rates ensure faster supply of metabolic intermediates
essential for fatty acid, amino acid, and nucleotide synthesis,
facilitating rapid growth and division of tumor cells (14). At the
same time, the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is
highly active to provide precursors for biomass production and
bioenergetics, a situation that can only be maintained through
efﬁcient replenishment of TCA cycle intermediates, for instance,
through glutamine addiction, a phenomenon called anaplerosis
(14). Thus, mitochondria in cancer cells remain metabolically
active, meeting their bioenergetic needs by using alternative
substrates while also supplying metabolic intermediates to sustain their proliferative capacity.
The relevance of mitochondrial metabolism in cancer is
emphasized by the identiﬁcation of tumors with mtDNA mutations (15); these mtDNA mutations seem to alter mitochondrial
metabolism, enhance tumorigenesis, and allow cancer cell adaptation to changing environment. In addition, mutations in nDNAencoded mitochondrial genes, including TCA cycle enzymes
succinate dehydrogenase subunits (SDH), fumarate hydratase
(FH), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), contribute to
tumorigenesis as well as tumor progression (16). Another example of the vital role of mitochondria for tumor progression, is the
ﬁnding that reduction of systemic copper has antiproliferative
effects, by reducing activity of the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase, which leads to a decrease in ATP levels despite
increased glycolysis rates (17). In addition to these metabolic
switches, mitochondrial metabolism can also promote the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
change the cellular redox status. Mitochondrial ROS are important signaling molecules in the context of tumorigenesis by
modifying the transcriptional activities of factors such as HIF-1,
FOS, and JUN to change gene expression and stimulate cancer cell
proliferation (15). These ﬁndings strongly support the fact that
mitochondrial function is fundamental for cancer cells survival
and proliferation, and in this light it is interesting that speciﬁc
antibiotics—those that target mitochondrial function—were
identiﬁed as antiproliferative treatment (18). As such, the reemergence of mitochondria as a central metabolic hub required
for tumorigenesis highlights its potential as a target for cancer
therapy.

Tetracyclines in Cancer Research
The rise of the genomic era has allowed researchers to investigate the molecular function of many genes in great detail, but the
drastic adverse effects of complete gain- or loss-of-function called
for a more subtle approach. To serve this purpose, tetracycline
inducible gene-expression systems have been widely adopted to
regulate the spatiotemporal expression of oncogenes and tumorsuppressor genes in cancer development (19). These Tet-ON/TetOFF gene regulation systems are based on Escherichia coli tetracycline resistance operon. E.coli that express this operon acquire a
membrane efﬂux pump that pumps out metal-bound tetracycline
in exchange for a proton. Overexpression of the efﬂux pump
would protect the bacterium against tetracycline, but eventually
cause a deleterious loss of the membrane potential, and hence
requires strict regulation (20). It is the operon's structural organization and mode of regulation that made it ideal for applications in eukaryotic cells. The operon contains an operator
sequence (TetO) and two genes encoding the efﬂux pump and
tetracycline-repressor protein (TetR). When the operon is

4448 Cancer Res; 75(21) November 1, 2015

expressed under normal conditions, the TetR protein binds to
the TetO sequence and thereby inhibits expression of the operon.
The presence of tetracyclines, however, interrupts TetR binding to
TetO and allows expression of the operon (19). TetR and TetO
were the foundation of the commonly used Tet-ON/Tet-OFF
system (21, 22). The Tet-OFF system was established by fusing
TetR to a VP16 transcription activation domain that binds to
multiple TetO sequences to drive transcription of a transgene with
a minimal promoter (e.g., TATA box; ref. 21). In this case, the
tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) loses its binding
potential to TetO upon tetracycline supplementation, and thereby
prevents transgene expression. In the Tet-ON set-up or reversed
transactivation (rtTA), the transgene transcription is only induced
by rtTA binding to TetO upon addition of tetracycline or its more
stable derivative doxycycline (22). Because gene expression can be
regulated in a spatiotemporal manner, both the Tet-ON and TetOFF have been popular tools in cell culture models as well as
model organisms, including mice (19).
Despite all the enthusiasm, the use of tetracyclines in such
experimental setup comes at a cost. The inhibition of mitochondrial translation through tetracyclines, for instance, doxycycline,
instigates adverse effects on mitochondria at the concentration
generally used in Tet-ON/Tet-OFF systems (Fig. 1). Doxycycline
exposure, even at low concentrations, increased glycolytic metabolism and markedly reduced the oxygen consumption of several
human cell lines, including lung, prostate, and cervical cancer cell
lines (23). We recently demonstrated that exposure to low-concentration doxycycline elicits similar adverse effects, that is, mitonuclear protein imbalance and decreased oxygen consumption
(12). This mitochondrial dysfunction was found in several of the
commonly used cell lines, such as HeLa, HEK293T, and Hepa 1–6.
In addition, this metabolic stress was conserved in other model
organisms, including worms, ﬂies, mice, and even plants. Strikingly, a reanalysis of microarray transcriptome proﬁles of the
human bladder cancer cell line RT112 exposed to doxycycline
showed a 10% change in global gene expression (12), conﬁrming
the molecular basis for the widespread adverse effects of this
treatment (Fig. 1).

Perspectives
The Tet-ON/Tet-OFF system has allowed a more intricate study
of gene function without the dramatic adverse effects associated
with gain- or loss-of-function mutants. Nevertheless, it has
become apparent that gene-expression regulation using doxycycline or similar antibiotics also induces molecular changes that
can seriously confound the experimental outcome. Therefore, we
advocate against the use of doxycycline in such systems. This not
only applies for researchers investigating mitochondrial function
speciﬁcally, but given the central role of mitochondria in cellular
physiology, this is also relevant for other ﬁelds, including cancer.
So what is the alternative? New tetracycline-responsive systems
have been developed that are more sensitive, and hence require
lower doxycycline doses that do not cause overt adverse effects on
mitochondrial function or global gene expression (24). Nevertheless, we propose that mild, even nonmeasureable, changes
may sensitize a cell or organism to the intended alteration in gene
expression, and thereby introduce a "two-hit model" (12). Other
inducible systems, such as the tamoxifen-responsive estrogen
receptor, also suffer from adverse effects, particularly in the liver
of mice that have been engineered with this type of regulation

The Adverse Effects of Tetracyclines in Cancer Research

(25). The only setup that so far appears to be safe is the lightswitchable system that is responsive to blue light (26), although
further research is necessary to establish whether absorption
of this light by speciﬁc proteins indeed does not interfere with
cellular function.
Finally, the extensive use of tetracycline in the clinic and in
livestock should be carefully evaluated and monitored. In the
United States and countries in the European Union, the supply of
tetracycline destined for animal use exceeds 8.5 million kilograms
a year (27, 28). Similar to the exogenously added antibiotics, for
example, in the Tet-ON/Tet-OFF, these antibiotics may end up in
the serum used in cell culture media, and thereby confound
experimental outcomes in research. More importantly, at least
from a global health perspective, high concentrations of antibiotics are ending up in the environment. Little is known about the
exact antibiotic concentrations in soils, but tetracycline concentrations up to 300 mg/kg have been reported in speciﬁc contexts,
such as swine manure (29) or agricultural ﬁelds in Beijing suburbs
(30). The magnitude of the effects on plants, animals, and

humans requires more investigation, but it is clear that the
excessive use of antibiotics can have a major impact on public
health (Fig. 1). This involves the potential hazards of antibiotic
resistance, disturbed gut microbiota, but also mitochondrial
toxicity.
