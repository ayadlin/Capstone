Abstract

Author Manuscript

Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death, but its molecular mechanism
remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that heat shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1) is a
negative regulator of ferroptotic cancer cell death. Erastin, a specific ferroptosis-inducing
compound, stimulates heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)-dependent HSPB1 expression in cancer cells.
Knockdown of HSF1 and HSPB1 enhances erastin-induced ferroptosis, whereas heat shock
pretreatment and overexpression of HSPB1 inhibits erastin-induced ferroptosis. Protein kinase Cmediated HSPB1 phosphorylation confers protection against ferroptosis by reducing ironmediated production of lipid reactive oxygen species. Moreover, inhibition of the HSF1-HSPB1
pathway and HSPB1 phosphorylation increases the anticancer activity of erastin in human
xenograft mouse tumor models. Our findings reveal an essential role for HSPB1 in iron
metabolism with important effects on ferroptosis-mediated cancer therapy.

Introduction
Author Manuscript

Cell death occurs in many forms with different hallmarks depending on the type of stress (1,
2). In addition to apoptosis, several types of caspase-independent programmed cell death
have recently been identified to regulate various physiological and pathological processes
(3–5). Among them is ferroptosis, coined by Scott J. Dixon, Brent R. Stockwell, and
colleagues in 2012, which refers to an iron-dependent novel form of non-apoptotic cell death
(6). Ferroptosis is significantly distinct at morphological, biochemistral, and genetic levels

from other forms of cell death such as apoptosis and necrosis (6). For example, the classic
morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis (e.g., chromatin fragmentation,
mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and poly ADP ribose polymerase
cleavagation) and necrosis (e.g., disruption of the cellular membrane, swelling of the
cytoplasm and mitochondria, cellular energy depletion) are not observed in ferroptosis (6).
This process is characterized by the overwhelming, iron-dependent accumulation of lethal
lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) (6). Erastin functions as a specific ferroptosis activator
by acting on mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels or cystine/glutamate
antiporters, exhibiting selectivity for several tumor cells bearing oncogenic RAS (7–10). The
morphological features of erastin-treated cells include smaller cell size and smaller
mitochondria with increased membrane density and loss of structural integrity (6, 9). In
contrast, ferrostatin-1 is a potent and selective inhibitor of ferroptosis through preventing
erastin-induced accumulation of lipid ROS, but not chelating iron (6). Several genes or
proteins responsible for the regulation of iron and lipid ROS metabolism have been
implicated in ferroptosis (11). For instance, glutathione peroxidase 4 has been identified as a
negative regulator of ferroptosis by limiting lipid ROS production (12), but the intricate
regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis remain largely unknown. Necroptosis is a form of
regulated necrosis that can be activated by ligands of death receptors under apoptotic
deficient conditions. Recent studies indicate that ferroptosis, but not necroptosis, contributes
to acute renal failure and renal tubular cell death after ischemia (13, 14). This result
indicates that different types of regulated death may be involved in different tissue ischemia
reperfusion injuries.

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are constitutively expressed under normal conditions, but are
inducibly overexpressed under stressful conditions such as heat shock, pH shift, and hypoxia
(15). Based on their molecular mass, HSPs are generally divided into six families, namely
HSP100, HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, HSP40, and the small heat shock proteins. Heat shock
factors (HSFs) are the master transcriptional factors that regulate the inducible synthesis of
these HSPs during stress (16). HSPs mainly function as molecular chaperones and protect
cells against harmful stimuli by stabilizing unfolded or misfolded peptides and repairing
denatured proteins or promoting their degradation (15). Inducible HSPs have been reported
to render cancer cells resistant to apoptosis and necrosis in both chaperone activitydependent and -independent ways (17), but their roles in ferroptosis has not yet been
investigated.

Author Manuscript

In this study, we demonstrate that HSPB1 (also called mouse HSP25 or human HSP27), a
member of the small heat shock proteins, is highly inducible following erastin treatment in
several types of cancer cells. Phosphorylated HSPB1 acts as a negative regulator of
ferroptosis by reducing cellular iron uptake and lipid ROS production. Inhibition of HSPB1
expression and phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo increases the anticancer activity of
erastin-mediated ferroptosis. Our findings present a novel role for HSPB1 in the regulation
of ferroptosis with important effects on erastin-mediated anticancer therapy. Our findings
also provide new insight into how cancer cells are able to avoid the ferroptotic cell death
process.

Results
Erastin induces HSF1-dependent HSPB1 expression in human cancer cells

Author Manuscript

To determine whether erastin induces HSP expression in cancer cells, human cervical
carcinoma HeLa cells were treated with erastin for eight and 24 hours, and the mRNA levels
of HSP100 (e.g., ClpB), HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, HSP40, and HSPB1 were analyzed by
quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). Among these HSPs, HSPB1 was
the most highly-induced gene (Fig. 1A). Consistently, Western blot analysis revealed that
the protein level of HSPB1, but not HSP90 and HSP70, was significantly increased in HeLa
cells following erastin treatment (Fig. 1B). In addition, erastin also induced the expression
of HSPB1, but not HSP90 and HSP70, in other human cancer cell lines including U2OS
(osteosarcoma) and LNCaP (prostate adenocarcinoma) (Fig. 1B). To determine whether
HSF1, the master regulator of heat-induced HSP expression (16), was required for erastininduced HSPB1 expression, a target-specific shRNA against HSF1 was transfected into
HeLa, U2OS and LNCaP cells. The knockdown of HSF1 significantly inhibited erastininduced HSPB1 mRNA (Fig. 1C) and protein (Fig. 1D) expression. Collectively, these
findings suggest that the HSF1-dependent HSPB1 expression may be involved in the
regulation of erastin-induced ferroptosis.
Inhibition of HSF1-dependent HSPB1 expression increases erastin-induced ferroptosis

Author Manuscript

To characterize the role of the HSF1-HSPB1 pathway in ferroptosis, erastin-induced growth
inhibition was assayed using an alamarBlue Cell Viability Assay Kit. The downregulation of
HSF1 (Fig. 2A) and HSPB1 (Fig. 2B) by specific shRNAs increased erastin-induced growth
inhibition in HeLa (Fig. 2C), U2OS (Fig. 2D), and LNCaP cells (Fig. 2E), suggesting that
the HSF1-HSPB1 pathway might be a negative regulator of erastin-induced cancer cell
death. Indeed, the knockdown of HSF1 and HSPB1 similarly increased erastin-induced
intracellular concentrations of iron (Fig. 2F) and lipid ROS (Fig. 2G), two surrogate markers
for ferroptosis (6). As expected, the increase in cellular iron in HSPB1 knockdown cells was
associated with increased expression of transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFR1) and a mild
decrease in the expression of ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) (Fig. 2H). Unlike staurosporine
(an inducer for apoptosis) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, an inducer for necrosis), erastin did
not significantly elevate the caspase 3 activity (as a marker for apoptosis, Fig. 2I) and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) release (as a marker for necrosis, Fig. 2J). LDH is a soluble cytosolic
enzyme that is released into the culture medium following loss of membrane integrity
resulting from necrosis. Our data of LDH release is consistent with a previous finding that
necrosis is not observed in cancer cells following erastin treatment (6). In addition,
secondary lipid oxidation products (e.g., 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) (6) may also inactivate LDH
(18).
Moreover, treatment with deferoxamine (an iron-chelating agent) and ferrostain-1 (an
inhibitor of ferroptosis), but not Z-VAD-FMK (a general caspase inhibitor), necrostain 1s
(Nec-1s, an inhibitor of necroptosis), or cyclosporin A (CsA, an inhibitor of cyclophilin D),
prevented erastin-induced growth inhibition in HSF1 and HSPB1 knockdown HeLa (Fig.
2K) and U2OS (Fig. 2L) cells. Thus, these findings indicate that the inhibition of HSF1-

dependent HSPB1 expression specifically increased erastin-induced ferroptosis but not other
types of cell death (e.g., apoptosis, necrosis and necroptosis) in cancer cells.
HSPB1 overexpression inhibits erastin-induced ferroptosis

Author Manuscript

To further characterize the role of HSPB1 in ferroptosis, we first determined whether heat
shock-induced HSPB1 expression would inhibit erastin-induced ferroptosis. Heat shock
pretreatment at 42.5°C for one hour significantly increased HSF1 phosphorylation at Ser326
(a marker for increased HSF1 transcription activity by heat stress (19)) (Fig. 3A) and mRNA
expression of HSPs including HSP70 (Fig. 3B) and HSPB1 (Fig. 3C) at a recovery times of
eight to 24 hours. Importantly, heat shock pretreatment reduced erastin-induced growth
inhibition (Fig. 3D and 3E), suggesting a protective effect of the heat shock response in the
regulation of ferroptosis. In contrast, the knockdown of HSF1 and HSPB1 by shRNA
remarkably reversed the heat shock pretreatment-mediated protective effect following
erastin treatment (Fig. 3F and 3G). Furthermore, overexpression of HSPB1 by transfection
of HSPB1-cDNA inhibited erastin-induced growth inhibition in HeLa cells (Fig. 3H),
further confirming HSPB1 as a negative regulator of erastin-induced ferroptosis.
HSPB1 phosphorylation mediates resistance to erastin-induced ferroptosis

In response to erastin, the levels of phosphorylation and expression of HSPB1 were elevated
in HeLa cells (Fig. 1 and Fig. 4A). To gain insight into the intricate molecular mechanism
by which HSPB1 regulates erastin-induced ferroptosis in cancer cells, we next explored
whether alterations in the phosphorylation of HSPB1 influences ferroptosis. Previous studies
have indicated that HSPB1phosphorylation during stress is regulated by several kinases such
as PKC (20). Consistently, PKC inhibitors (e.g., Gö 6983 and calphostin C) significantly
blocked HSPB1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A) and increased growth inhibition following erastin
treatment (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the expression of phosphorylation-deficient mutants of
HSPB1 (S15A/S86A) did not suppress erastin-induced ferroptosis, whereas wild-type
HSPB1 cDNA did (Fig. 4C). Phosphorylation of HSPB1 positively modulates actin
polymerization and reorganization, which limits iron uptake (21, 22). As expected, the
suppression of HSPB1 phosphorylation by PKC inhibitors (e.g., Gö 6983 and calphostin C)
and disruptions of actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D similarly increased intracellular iron
(Fig. 4D), lipid ROS production (Fig. 4E), and growth inhibition (Fig. 4F). Members of the
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family activate the Arp2/3-complex leading to
actin polymerization (23). To further confirm the role of actin polymerization in ferroptosis,
we genetically knocked down WAVE2, a key member of WASP in mammals. Suppression
of WAVE2 expression by shRNA (Fig. 4G) in HeLa cells increased intracellular iron (Fig.
4H) and growth inhibition (Fig. 4I) following erastin treatment. These findings suggest that
phosphorylation of HSPB1 contributes to ferroptosis resistance through inhibiting
cytoskeleton-mediated iron uptake and lipid ROS production.
Suppression of the HSF1-HSPB1 pathway increases anticancer activity of erastin in vivo
To test if suppression of HSF1 and HSPB1 expression also increased tumor sensitivity to
erastin in vivo, the HSF1 and HSPB1 stable knockdown HeLa cells were implanted into the
subcutaneous space of the right flank of mice. Beginning at day seven, these mice were

treated with erastin. Compared with the control shRNA group, erastin treatment effectively
reduced the size of tumors formed by HSF1 and HSPB1 knockdown cells (Fig. 5A). Q-PCR
analysis of the expression of PTGS2, a marker for assessment of ferroptosis in vivo (12),
indicated that the knockdown of HSF1 and HSPB1 increases ferroptosis (Fig. 5B).
Moreover, KRIBB3, an inhibitor of blocking protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of
HSPB1 (24), dose-dependently increased erastin-induced tumor inhibition (Fig. 5C), which
was associated with an increased PTGS2 mRNA expression (Fig. 5D). Together, these
findings demonstrated that the HSF1-HSPB1 pathway is important in modulating the
anticancer activity of erastin-mediated ferroptosis in vivo.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

The cellular stress response is a complicated network involved in the activation of survival
pathways and the initiation of cell death (25, 26). In this study, we demonstrated that the
activation of the HSF1-HSPB1 pathway negatively regulated erastin-induced ferroptosis. In
addition, we demonstrated that the PKC-mediated HSPB1 phosphorylation was required for
conferring resistance to erastin-induced ferroptosis, possibly through regulating ironmediated lipid ROS production. In particular, genetic knock-down or pharmacologic
inhibition of the HSF1-HSPB1 pathway significantly increased the anticancer activity of
erastin in vitro and in vivo. These data not only reveal a novel role for HSPB1 in ferroptosis,
but also suggest the inherent regulatory mechanism of HSPB1 as a potential therapeutic
target against cancer.

Ferroptosis was first described in engineered human foreskin fibroblasts as a unique
response to oncogenic RAS selective lethal compounds such as erastin (8) as distinguishable
from all other types of cell death (6). Subsequently, others (6, 10, 12) have confirmed that
erastin also induces ferroptosis in RAS-carrying cancer cells such as HeLa, U2OS, and
LNCaP cells. In the present study, we discovered that erastin treatment also induces a
significant heat-shock response in cancer cells. As a set of well-ordered and regulated
responses to stress, the heat-shock response is characterized by the sequential activation of
HSF1 and production of HSPs (15, 16). Our findings suggest that HSF1-dependent HSPB1
expression can also protect tumor cells against erastin-mediated ferroptosis, because the
inhibition of the HSF1-HSPB1 pathway significantly enhanced the anticancer activity of
erastin in vitro and in vivo. Given that heat shock pretreatment similarly protects tumor cells
against erastin-induced ferroptosis, it will be important to explore the possible role of other
HSPs in the regulation of the ferroptotic response.

Until recently, HSPB1 has been considered a molecular chaperone involved in regulation of
the organization of the cytoskeleton (27) or stabilizing aberrantly folded proteins to prevent
aggregation (28). Upon phosphorylation, however, HSPB1 oligomers dissociate into
monomers, which then functions as an inhibitor of apoptosis (29) and inducer of autophagy
(30). The phosphorylation of HSPB1 is dynamic and regulated by different kinases such as
MAPKAPK-2/3 (31), cGMP-dependent protein kinase (32), and PKC (20). We observed
that erastin-induced HSPB1 phosphorylation is mediated by PKC and its attenuation by
PKC inhibitor or genetic knock-down enhances erastin-induced ferroptosis. Collectively,

these findings suggest that the induction of HSPB1 phosphorylation is a universal prosurvival event against various types of cell death, including ferroptosis.

Iron is a trace element essential for fundamental metabolic processes and cell survival, but
its excessive accumulation causes cell death (11, 33). For example, ferroptosis is a type of
cell death resulting from an iron-dependent accumulation of lipid ROS (6), which can be
prevented by iron chelation or inhibition of iron uptake, as in the use of deferoxamine (6).
Although the specific role of iron in ferroptosis remains unclear, one or more iron-dependent
enzymes may function as part of the oxidative lethal mechanism (6). Previously, HSPB1
was suggested as a negative regulator of intracellular iron accumulation and uptake in
fibroblasts or the heart (34–36). Here, we provide evidence that overexpression of HSPB1
also inhibits erastin-induced iron uptake, whereas knockdown of HSPB1 increases erastininduced iron uptake in cancer cells. Thus, when cancer cells contain aberrantly elevated
levels of iron and HSPB1 (37, 38), the cells may be predisposed to ferroptotic cell death if
the HSPB1 pathway is down-regulated.
In conclusion, our discovery of HSPB1 as a critical regulator of ferroptotic cancer cell death
has provided new insights into the molecular mechanism of ferroptosis. It not only confirms
the involvement of iron uptake and lipid oxidization in ferroptosis, but also provides a basis
for possible combinational cancer therapy targeting both HSPB1 and ferroptosis. Given the
pathogenic roles of ferroptosis in various diseases (e.g., excitotoxic cell death, Huntington’s
disease, periventricular leukomalacia, and renal injury) (6, 39), as well as the protective role
of HSPB1 in these diseases (40), it will be important to elucidate the mechanisms underlying
HSPB1-mediated ferroptosis resistance under various conditions.
