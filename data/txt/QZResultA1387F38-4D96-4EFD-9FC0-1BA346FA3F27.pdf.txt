BACKGROUND: We evaluated the efficacy of topically applied human recombinant epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) for the treatment of oral mucositis induced by radiotherapy (RT), with or without chemotherapy, in patients with head and neck cancer. METHODS: Patients receiving definitive chemoradiotherapy,
definitive RT, or postoperative RT to the oral cavity or oropharynx were recruited from 6 institutions and
enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. Patients were assigned to a placebo group or to 1 of 3 EGF-treatment groups (10, 50, or 100 lg/mL doses, delivered in a spray, twice
daily). The grade of mucositis was evaluated using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scoring
criteria. Responders to EGF were defined as having an RTOG grade of 2 or lower at the fourth- or fifthweek examinations during RT, but an enduring RTOG grade 2 for 2 weeks was an exception. RESULTS: Of
the 113 patients included in the study, 28 received placebo and 29 received EGF at 10 lg/mL, 29 at 50 lg/
mL, and 27 at 100 lg/mL. EGF significantly reduced the incidence of severe oral mucositis at the primary

KEY WORDS: mucositis, EGF, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, head and neck cancer.

Oral mucositis is one of the most frequent and serious
complications of radiotherapy (RT) and chemoradiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancers.1 The combination of RT and chemotherapy further aggravates oral
mucositis, which results in dose-limiting toxicities in
many patients. However, the combined use of RT and
chemotherapy remains popular because it enhances antitumor effects and increases the organ preservation rate.2-5
Radiation-induced injury to the oral and pharyngeal mucosa causes serious problems that can limit the therapeutic
effects of RT by making it difficult to complete the
planned course of treatment.6-8 Severe oral or pharyngeal
mucositis is very painful; the condition limits oral intake
and results in prolonged malnutrition and dehydration,
which subsequently decreases the quality of life and can
even result in death.9-13 Thus, attention should be focused
on the aggressive supportive care needed.
Generally, oral mucosal cells require about 5 days to
regenerate in mice and humans, making them highly susceptible to RT- and chemotherapy-induced injury.8,14-17
No effective method is known for protecting against radiation-induced mucositis, and almost all current treatments are designed to relieve symptoms and prevent
secondary infection. A review of more than 100 studies
determined that no effective option existed for treating or
preventing oral mucositis.18 Meanwhile, conservative
management of oral mucositis is very important. The clinician must be concerned about dehydration, malnutrition, and pain control.
Epidermal growth factor (EGF), first discovered in
the submaxillary gland of a rat in 1962, comprises a single-chain polypeptide containing 53 amino acids.19-22
EGF was later discovered in various normal tissues and
body fluids, including the skin, mucosa, tears, cornea, saliva, milk, semen, and fluids secreted by the duodenal
glands.23-32 EGF helps maintain tissue homeostasis by
regulating epithelial cell proliferation, growth, and migration. It also induces angiogenesis, which provides nutritional support for tissues. Thus, EGF plays an important
3700

role in wound healing and tissue generation and may be
useful in the treatment of radiation-induced oral mucositis.33-35 Two previous studies investigated the role of EGF
in alleviating radiation-induced mucositis.36,37 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of
EGF in head and neck cancer patients receiving RT, with
or without chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
A multi-institutional, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled phase 2 trial was performed in patients receiving
primary RT, primary chemoradiotherapy, or postoperative
RT for head and neck cancer. The patients were recruited
from 6 academic hospitals in Korea. The study comprised 2
steps (Fig. 1). The first involved confirming the response
rate (RR; see endpoint for definition) in the study groups
compared with the control group. The purpose of this step
was to define the optimal dose of EGF. The study was
designed to end when the resulting P value was .01, demonstrating a significant benefit from all study groups, or
when the resulting P value was >.5, demonstrating that no
EGF dose had any therapeutic effect. If the P value fell
between 0.01 and 0.5, then the study continued to the second step to further examine the effects of EGF. The doses in
the second step were based on the RR of each study group
during the first step. The severity of mucositis was evaluated
once a week for 5 weeks of RT, using subjective and objective grading in accordance with the RTOG scoring criteria
(Table 1). We randomized patients to institution and concurrent use of chemotherapy. We assigned patients randomly to 4 arms: 3 treated arms according to dose of EGF
(10, 50, or 100 lg/mL), and placebo.

tory of cytotoxic chemotherapy or RT within 3 weeks of
the study, or used systemic or topical oral corticosteroids
within 30 days of the study or participated in another clinical study within 30 days of the study. Induction chemotherapy or concurrent cisplatin was allowed. Oral care and
medications such as steroids, amifostine, G(M)-CSF,
sucralfate slurry, benzydamine hydrochloride rinse, cryotherapy, and laser therapy were not allowed during RT
but a chlorhexidine gluconate rinse was allowed.

Radiation Therapy and Concurrent
Treatment
RT was performed with conventional fractionation once
daily, 5 times a week, for at least 5 weeks. The fraction size
was 2.0  0.25 Gy, delivered to at least 1 anatomic site of
the oral cavity and oropharynx. RT fields included visually observable mucosa that was included in the clinical

target volume. Two-dimensional, 3-dimensional, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy were allowed. The oral
mucosa was allowed to heal completely before postoperative radiation therapy. Concurrent chemotherapy with
cisplatin was allowed.
All patients gargled with chlorhexidine to maintain
oral hygiene, regardless of whether they were in the study
group or the placebo group. Medication for mucosal pain
was allowed, according to the WHO 3-step analgesic ladder. Patients whose radiation therapy was interrupted on
3 or more consecutive days were eliminated from the
study.

Drug Treatment
The EGF and placebo treatments were supplied free of
charge. Three concentrations of EGF and a placebo containing the drug delivery vehicle were manufactured,
packaged, and supplied in a double-blind fashion. The vehicle primarily comprised 10 mM phosphate buffer and
6% w/v poloxamer 407.
In this study, EGF was applied in a spray form at
concentrations of 10, 50, or 100 lg/mL. The EGF dose
actually administered was 10, 50, or 100 lg per patient
per day. The patients were instructed to spray either the
test drug or the placebo over the entire oral mucosa and
then swallow the residual, twice daily, from the first day
through week 5 of RT. Oral intake was restricted for 30
minutes after EGF spraying.

Response Evaluation
The primary endpoint examined was mucositis. Every
week radiation oncologists evaluated the grade of mucositis using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
(RTOG) scoring criteria for acute mucosal morbidity.
Responders to EGF were defined as having an RTOG
grade of 1 or lower at the fourth- or fifth-week examinations during RT, only 1 episode of RTOG grade 2 for 1
week was regarded as responder, but an enduring RTOG
grade 2 for 2 weeks was an exception. Patients scoring
RTOG grades of 3 or 4 for at least 2 weeks were considered nonresponders. Secondary endpoints included
WHO oral toxicity grade, patient weight, pain score,
opioid analgesia use, and time to develop mucositis. Vital
signs were checked weekly, clinical laboratory values were
3702

checked biweekly, and the incidence of adverse events was
assessed to evaluate safety.

Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical
Analysis System. Statistical analyses were performed using
the chi-square test and Fisher exact for comparisons of categorical parameters, and analysis of variance (ANOVA)
and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used for continuous
parameters.
We performed the ‘superior to control test’ using the
prespecified a global, 1 -sided type I error of ca ¼ 0.025.
We used Fisher combination test in the final analysis, where
the null hypothesis can be rejected when the product of the
P values from both study parts falls below Ca ¼ 0.0038.
We considered the arcsine transformation (ie, arcsin place
pﬃﬃﬃ
p before performing the normal test (Z-test). At weeks 4
and 5, RR differences between the placebo and study
groups were expected to exceed 25%. We calculated the
sample size for the study until the interim analysis by
assuming a RR of 23% in the control group and 48% in
the test group. We needed 4  21 patients to attain 90%
power for a 1-sided P value of P1  .10 in the interim
analysis. After adjusting for a dropout rate of 10%, the
total number of patients that had to be recruited was
determined to be 104 (26 patients per group).
RR was analyzed by multiple comparisons with the
control group. We performed the 1-sided Z-test using the
arcsine transformation between the treatment groups with
the control group. The minimum P value of the 3 1-sided
Z-test multiplied by 3 was the global P value (ie, P1 ¼ 3
minutes [P1,1 P1,2 P13]).

RESULTS
Patients
We screened 116 patients between January 10, 2007, and
August 1, 2007, and 113 patients were randomized and enrolled in this study. Three patients refused to participate,
and 13 patients dropped out before the fifth week of RT;
thus, endpoint analysis was performed on 100 patients (31
females, 69 males; Fig. 2). Six cases were dropped from the
study because of their radiotherapy being interrupted for
more than 2 consecutive days, 3 cases for receiving

1 case because of adverse effects of radiotherapy, and 1 case
for not being treated with the test drug. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 2. A slight, statistically nonsignificant sex bias was detected toward males in the EGF 50 lg/
mL group. Patient ages ranged from 18 to 77 years, and 111
of 113 patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.
The carcinoma origin sites were nasopharyngeal (40
patients), oropharyngeal (23 patients), and the oral cavity
(21 patients). The fraction sizes were 0  2 Gy for 82
patients. Sixty-one patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin. No significant difference was
observed in the distribution of prognostic factors among the
placebo and study groups.

37%, while the RR of the EGF groups were 57.7%, 64%,
and 59.1%, for the 10, 50, and 100 lg/mL dose groups,
respectively (Table 3). The group treated with 50 lg/mL
of EGF had higher RRs compared with the placebo group
(P ¼ .0246). Although not statistically significant, trends
in the other 2 study groups were found for superior RRs
as compared with the control groups in radiation-induced
oral mucositis. The proportion of patients with oral
mucositis  RTOG grade 3 at weeks 4 and 5 of RT is
shown in Figure 3. Oral mucositis  RTOG grade 3 was
experienced in 30.8% and 33.3% of the placebo group in
the fourth and fifth weeks, respectively, but was experienced by less than 20% of patients in the study groups
(the differences were not statistically significant, P ¼
.3068 by Fisher exact test). In contrast, the proportion of
patients with mild oral mucositis was higher in the study
group (especially arm 2, 50 lg/mL) receiving RT at weeks

complications.39,40 Thus, concern is growing about
mucositis in head and neck cancer. We, therefore, conducted a phase 2, prospective, double-blind clinical study
to evaluate the therapeutic effects and optimal dose of
EGF for the treatment of oral mucositis in patients undergoing RT, with or without chemotherapy. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized and placebo-controlled
human study of EGF in patients with cancer. We used a
unique spray-type administration method. Previous studies have used G-CSF–containing or EGF-containing
mouth rinses to deliver drugs locally to the oral cavity. A
previous phase 1 clinical trial of rhEGF for chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis showed that low concentrations of rhEGF, given as a mouthwash 3 times daily,
delayed the initiation of mucositis and decreased its severity.35 We designed a spray capable of transferring highly
concentrated EGF to the damaged mucosa. Further basic
and clinical research is needed to explore the advantages
and disadvantages of this method in further detail, but we
believe that the method is a great improvement over existing drug delivery systems.
Our data revealed that the 50 lg/mL dose of EGF
was the most effective for treating mucositis. This dose is
consistent with the results of a preclinical efficacy study in
pigs that examined the normal healing process of full thickness defects, as well as a similar study that used irradiated rats as models for oral mucositis.37 It is often difficult
to standardize the administration of topical medications.

to the week of radiation therapy.

In particular, we found that it was challenging to determine the most effective dose and fractionation schedule of
the intraoral spray used in this study because of variations
in patients’ oral mucosal status and overall medical conditions. However, the optimal dose and scheme of EGF will
be investigated in further clinical studies.
Radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs easily damage mucosal and dermal tissues as cells in the basal layer of
the epithelium divide very rapidly. In addition, as the
pathobiology of mucositis due to radiation and chemotherapy appear to be similar,41 the recovery process may
also be similar. Thus, the therapeutic approach is the
same. New cytokine-based drugs that selectively target
mucosal tissue show promise for treating oral mucositis.
Furthermore, EGF has been shown to promote healing of
chronic diabetic foot ulcers,42 and we have found that
EGF increases the proliferation of human fibroblasts and
keratinocytes that have been damaged by radiation (S. W.
Lee, unpublished data). These observations suggest that
EGF promotes various types of wound healing. On the
basis of the biological properties of EGF and preliminary
experiments, we investigated whether topical application
of EGF could treat radiation-induced oral mucositis. The
results of this study suggest that EGF provided a therapeutic effect and that local application of EGF significantly
reduced the incidence of severe oral mucositis. The
3705

Original Article

mechanism by which EGF reduced radiation-induced
mucosal damage may lie in its ability to accelerate the proliferation of cells involved in wound healing. However,
the protective effects of EGF will be explored in further
preclinical and clinical studies.
The therapeutic effects of EGF were enhanced when
aggressive treatment strategies were used, such as those
involving concurrent chemoradiotherapy, large irradiated
volumes, and large radiation fraction size, by subgroup
analysis. A precondition for this study was severe mucositis. However, the study included a heterogeneous population of patients. The absence of severe mucositis in the
control group does not detract from the therapeutic effects
of EGF, because the severity of mucositis is directly
related to the type of radiation and the total dosage, fractionation, and duration of treatment.43-45 Differences in
the effects of EGF between the control- and EGF-treated
groups were enhanced as severe mucositis developed. This
differential effect increased with cumulative RT doses.
Thus, observing the patients for longer than 5 weeks could
have strengthened our study. We estimate the therapeutic
effect of EGF will be maximized when EGF is applied to
patients who develop oral mucositis.
Most secondary endpoint factors, such as WHO
mucositis criteria, use of opioids, and pain in the throat,
did not improve in the EGF group compared with the
control group. The RTOG and WHO criteria are the
most popular mucositis scoring systems, and often yield
concordant results.46 However, we observed discrepancies
between the 2 mucositis scoring systems in this study.
This discrepancy may reflect the failure of the EGF to
penetrate the deep regions of the throat, owing to limitations of the spray mechanism. Masucci et al decided not
to use the relatively common WHO classification, which
combines subjective and objective observations.47 The
eating habits of Koreans differ from those of Western societies, and many Korean people typically switch to soft
foods when they believe ill. Thus, the WHO classification
may not accurately reflect the nuances of Korean culture.
However, the RTOG classification is an objective method
wherein irradiated mucosa is observed and evaluated, and
this prevents misinterpretation.
The EGF spray can cover the oral cavity. EGF did
not improve pharyngeal mucositis, likely because EGF
did not effectively reach the pharyngeal mucosa. This
finding is a limitation of the drug delivery method. In
3706

some instances, systemic administration is needed and
subcutaneous administration may be substituted for local
application. We believe that local and systemic applications are often combined in the clinic. Although limitations exist associated with the use of a local spray, we
found that topical treatment of the oral mucosa with EGF
was effective in patients with mucositis who were undergoing RT, with or without chemotherapy.
No side effects or mortality were associated with
EGF, and the treatment was well- tolerated by patients.
The lack of serious complications is likely an advantage of
local drug application. However, one drawback to this
method was that the dose was self-administered by individual patients, who recorded their doses in a logbook. In
addition, many clinicians remain concerned about the
safety of EGF, citing fears that it could stimulate cancer
growth. Thus, whether exogenously administrated EGF
has effects on cancer cell proliferation should be determined before its use in patients with cancer. From a
review of the literature, we found no evidence that EGF
stimulated cancer cells.48-52 Similar results have been
observed by our group (G. Choi, unpublished data), but
this risk must be addressed before EGF is used for clinical
applications. Although EGF does not stimulate cancer
growth in cell biology experiments, the exact mechanism
of this finding will be explored in further studies.
In conclusion, use of the rhEGF oral spray during
RT (or concurrent chemoradiotherapy) may have potential benefit for oral mucositis in patients with head and
neck cancer. Further phase 3 studies are needed to confirm these results.
