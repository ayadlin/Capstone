Abstract
Exposure of Fisher344 rats to 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), a heterocyclic amine in cooked
meat, causes cancer in the rat ventral prostate, while sparing
the dorsolateral and anterior lobes. Uncovering the molecular
mechanisms of the lobe specificity of PhIP-induced rat
prostate cancer may provide clues to the pathogenesis of
human prostate cancer, which is also lobe selective. We
examined the prostate and other organs for mutation
frequencies using transgenic Fisher344 rats (Big Blue rats)
after PhIP treatment. After PhIP treatment for as early as
4 weeks, the colon, spleen, seminal vesicles, and all lobes of the
prostate had significantly elevated mutation frequencies
compared with the saline-treated control group, and the
differences became even greater after 8 weeks. G:C ! T:A
transversions were the predominant type of mutation. After
8 weeks of treatment with PhIP, the Ki-67 index was increased
(P < 0.001) in the ventral prostate, but not in the dorsolateral
or anterior prostate. An increase in the number of stromal
mast cells and macrophages was seen in the ventral prostate,
but not in the other prostatic lobes. The apoptotic index also
increased in the ventral lobe only. The increased proliferation
and cell death in response to PhIP indicates that in addition to
PhIP acting as an ‘‘initiator’’ of cancer, PhIP is also acting like
an organ- and lobe-specific tumor ‘‘promoter.’’ The prostate
lobe-specific infiltration of mast cells and macrophages in
response to PhIP suggests a potential new mechanism by which
this dietary compound can increase cancer risk—by prompting inflammation. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1378–84]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous malignancy
and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the
United States. Studies of identical twins have revealed a strong
hereditary component to prostate cancer, accounting for f40% of
the overall risk (1). Because roughly 60% is unaccounted for by
heredity, however, a significant component of the risk for
developing prostate cancer must be related to environmental
exposures. What are the environmental exposures that increase
prostate cancer risk?
There are two long-standing findings that may provide help in
answering this question: (a) the incidence and mortality rate of

prostate cancer vary worldwide, with the highest rates in the
United States and the lowest rates in China and Japan (2); and (b)
there is an increased risk of prostate cancer in men who
immigrated to the United States from China and Japan that
begins within one generation after migration (3–5). One major
distinction between men from Western cultures and those from
East and Southeast Asian cultures is a marked difference in diet.
Traditionally, diets rich in vegetables and fruits are consumed in
Southeast Asian countries, whereas diets rich in red meat and
animal fat, and low in vegetables and fruits, are consumed in
Western cultures. Although not unequivocal, there is epidemiologic
evidence of a link between prostate cancer incidence and mortality
and consumption of red meat and animal fats (6–9).
The biological mechanism by which a diet rich in red meat leads
to cancer has not been fully established. Although red meats
contain polyunstaturated fatty acids that may accelerate cancer
formation by a number of mechanisms (i.e., free-radical formation
during oxidative stress, effects on sex hormone levels, direct
signaling affecting cell growth and apoptosis; ref. 10), another
mechanism may relate to the cooking of meat at high temperatures (e.g., grilling, broiling or frying), which results in the
formation of heterocyclic amines (HCA; ref. 11). HCAs can be
metabolized to biologically active metabolites that form DNA
adducts, which lead to mutations and to organ-specific cancers.
2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) is the
most abundant HCA present in well-done and charred meats
(12). Exposure of laboratory rats to PhIP in the diet results in
several tumor types, including carcinomas of the intestine in both
sexes, in the mammary gland in females, and in the prostate in
males (11, 13–15). Cancers in these tissues in humans have all been
associated with PhIP exposure to some extent (6, 16–18), and all
of these cancers are common in Western countries and infrequent
in Southeast Asian countries (19). These same cancers are increasing rapidly in Japan in parallel with the ‘‘westernization’’ of the
diet (20).
Exposure of Fisher344 rats to dietary PhIP for 20 weeks results
in the development of localized invasive prostatic carcinomas
when examined after f52 weeks (21, 22). The carcinomas are lobe
specific in that they develop in the ventral lobe of the prostate but
not the dorsolateral or anterior lobes (21). This finding is intriguing
because human prostate cancer is also zone specific, in that most
cancers arise in the peripheral zone with less arising in the
transition zone and almost none arising in the central zone (23).
Therefore, uncovering the molecular mechanisms of the lobe
specificity of PhIP-induced cancer in the rat prostate may provide
clues to the molecular mechanisms for the lobe specificity of
cancer in the human prostate.
There are several possible explanations for the lobe selectivity
of PhIP-induced cancers in the rat. Cancer induction requires

PhIP as an Initiator and Promoter in Prostate

both ‘‘initiation’’ and ‘‘promotion.’’ Exposures that initiate cancer
are known to induce mutations, whereas those that promote
cancer are known to increase the proliferation index. It is not
clear whether the ventral lobe of the rat prostate is undergoing
selective initiation, promotion, or both in response to PhIP.
In terms of initiation, the accumulation of PhIP-DNA adducts
in response to dietary exposure has been examined in the
prostate lobes separately, and all lobes similarly form these
adducts (21). It is clear, however, that whereas adducts are
required for mutations, they may not be sufficient (24). The
mutation frequency and spectra in response to PhIP treatment
can be monitored using Fisher344 ‘‘Big Blue rats,’’ which are
transgenic for a phage E shuttle vector (25). Stuart et al. used this
model to show that after as little as 61 days of dietary PhIP
exposure, there is an f20-fold increase in the mutation frequency
in the rat prostate (26). Because the entire rat prostate was used
in the study by Stuart et al., the lobe specificity of prostate
mutations in the rat in response to PhIP has not been previously
examined (26). Thus, it is critical to determine whether the
ventral lobe is more susceptible to PhIP-induced mutations
because this could help to explain the lobe specificity of PhIPinduced prostate cancer.
In terms of tumor promotion, a proliferative index has been
assessed in all prostate lobes in response to 4 weeks of PhIP
treatment (21). Although Shirai reported a small but significant
increase in 5-bromodeoxyuridine uptake in the ventral and
dorsolateral lobes in response to PhIP, the lobe specificity of
mutations, proliferation rate, and histopathologic changes have not
been examined in the same setting in the rat.
Another potential explanation for the lobe selectivity of PhIPinduced prostate cancer may relate to inflammation because
several animal models of cancer have been shown to require an
inflammatory response for the cancers to occur (27, 28), and the
ventral prostate is known to develop spontaneous chronic
inflammation in Fisher344 rats that is associated with aging.
The mechanisms by which inflammation can increase cancer
risk are diverse and may involve initiation, promotion, or both
(27). It is important, therefore, to determine whether inflammatory cell infiltrates differ in the different prostate lobes in
response to PhIP.
In the present study, we addressed further the molecular
mechanisms for the lobe specificity of prostate cancer in the
Fisher344 rat by studying the mutation frequency and spectra in
each lobe (separately isolated) of the prostate after short-term
PhIP treatment. We also compared the mutation frequency and
spectra to those found in other organs that are targets of PhIPinduced carcinogenesis (colon and spleen) and those that are not
(liver, kidney, and seminal vesicles). In addition, we examined
histopathologic and immunophenotypic changes in response to
PhIP exposure in each prostate lobe, including cell proliferation
rate, and inflammatory cell infiltrates.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. PhIP hydrochloride was obtained from the NARD Institute
(Osaka, Japan) with purity above 99.9%.
Animals and treatment. Male Big Blue transgenic Fisher344 rats (13–
15 weeks old) were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Rats were
housed in an animal facility maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle, at a
constant temperature (22 F 2jC) and relative humidity (55 F 15%). Tap
water and food were available ad libitum. PhIP was suspended in saline
(14 mg/mL) and was given to the rats intragastrically by gavage at the

www.aacrjournals.org

dose of 70 mg/kg (5 mL/kg) thrice a week for 4 weeks (n = 3) and 8 weeks
(n = 3). For the control group, 5 mL/kg of saline was given intragastrically
thrice a week for 4 weeks (n = 3) and 8 weeks (n = 3). The animal weights
were recorded once per week until the end of the experiment. Rats were
euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation at day 30 for the 4-week treatment group
and at day 60 for the 8-week treatment group. All prostate lobes were
dissected separately into anterior, dorsolateral complex, and ventral lobes.
In addition, the seminal vesicles, liver, kidney, spleen, and colon were
immediately dissected. Half of each tissue was flash-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and then stored at 80jC. The rest of the tissues were fixed in
10% buffered formalin and examined by routine light microscopy.
Isolation of DNA. DNA was isolated using the RecoverEase protocol
(Stratagene). Briefly, 40 to 60 mg of tissue from the different prostate lobes
(anterior, ventral, and dorsolateral), seminal vesicles, liver, kidney, spleen,
and liver were disaggregated using a Wheaton Dounce tissue grinder, and
cell nuclei were collected by centrifuge at 1,100  g for 12 min. Nuclear
pellets were treated with proteinase K and RNAce-It (Stratagene) for
45 min at 50jC and were dialyzed against 10 mmol/L Tris/1 mmol/L EDTA
buffer (pH 7.5) for 48 h. The viscous DNA was stored at 4jC until
packaging.
Lambda cII mutation analysis. Big Blue rats contain a ELIZ shuttle
vector that includes the cII gene, which is the target for the mutagenesis
studies. The cII gene plays a critical role in the decision between lysis or
lysogeny of E phage following infection of Escherichia coli. In hfl 
bacteria, the cII protein is not degraded, and it activates transcription of
the cI repressor. The cI protein, in turn, inhibits the transcription of
several genes essential for the lytic response. This results in continuous
lysogeny and with no plaque formation. When there is an inactivating
mutation in the cII gene, the cI gene is not transcribed, and plaques
arise, which enables the number of mutant plaques under selective
conditions (24jC) to be determined. Because the ELIZ shuttle vector
contains the temperature-sensitive cI857 mutation, which inactivates the
cI repressor at 37jC, the phage multiplies through the lytic cycle under
nonselective conditions (37jC), resulting in plaque formation regardless
of the status of the cII gene. This allows the calculation of the number
of recovered phage genomes or the phage titer. The mutation frequency
is calculated by dividing the number of mutant plaques by the phage
titer.
We used the E Select-cII mutation detection system for Big Blue rodents
(Stratagene) for the lambda cII assay. The kit contains the Transpack
packaging extract and hfl  E. coli G1250. Genomic DNA (8 AL) was
incubated in the red tube of the Transpack packaging extract for 90 min at
30jC, and then 12 AL of the Transpack packaging extract from the blue
tube was transferred to the red tube and incubated for 90 min at 30jC.
Following the incubation, 1.1 mL of SM buffer [100 mmol/L NaCl, 8 mmol/L
MgSO47H2O, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.01% gelatin] was added to
each packaging reaction. One hundred microliters of packaged E phage
solution was mixed with 200 AL of G1250 at room temperature for 30 min,
mixed with 2.5 mL TB1 top agar, and plated on ten 10-cm dishes containing
25 mL bottom agar. The plates were incubated at 24jC for 48 h. For
titration, a 100-AL aliquot of a 1:100 dilution of the packaged E phage
solution was mixed with 200 AL of G1250 and 2.5 mL TB1 top agar, plated
on three dishes, and incubated at 37jC for 24 h.
Sequencing of cII mutants. To validate whether presumptive mutant
plaques actually represented phage genomes containing a mutant cII gene,
plaques obtained at 24jC were analyzed for cII gene sequence mutations.
When the number of mutant plaques exceeded 40 per assay, 10% to 30% of
mutant plaques were sequenced for the cII gene. The cII gene was
amplified by PCR using primer pair 5¶-CCGCTCTTACACATTCCAGC-3¶ and
5¶-CCTCTGCCGAAGTTGAGTAT-3¶. The amplified cII gene length is 294 bp,
and the total PCR fragment is 476 bp. The amplified cII gene was purified
by the Rapid 96 PCR Purification System (Marligen Bioscience, Ijamsville,
MD). DNA sequencing was done using an ABI Prism 3730 Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and the sequence was analyzed using
Sequencher v4.1.4 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI).
Antibodies. Anti–Ki-67 antibody (rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:4,000) was
from Novocastra (Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom). Antirat CD68

antibody (mouse monoclonal, clone ED1, dilution 1:2,000) was from Serotec
(Oxford, United Kingdom). Anti-glutathione-S-transferase antibody (rabbit
polyclonal, dilution 1:1,250) was from Lab Vision (Fremont, CA).
Anticleaved caspase 3 antibody (rabbit polyclonal) was from Cell Signaling
Technology (Beverly, MA).
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Histologic examination was
done on paraffin-embedded sections after H&E staining. Immunohistochemistry was done using the EnVision+ detection system (DAKO,
Carpinetria, CA). Briefly, paraffin sections were deparaffinized and
rehydrated through a graded alcohol series. For Ki-67 and GSTP1 staining,
steam heating in Target Retrieval Solution (DAKO) for 40 min was done.
For cleaved caspase 3 and CD68 staining, steam heating in Antigen
Unmasking Solution (Vector Laboratories, Burligame CA) for 20 min was
done. Primary antibodies were incubated for 45 min at room temperature
(Ki-67, CD68, cleaved caspase 3) or overnight at 4jC (GSTP1). Slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin.
Assessment of immunostaining. Ki-67 and caspase 3 staining was
evaluated by quantitative analysis using the Chromavision ACIS (Clarient,
San Juan Capistrano, CA). At least 10 regions were randomly chosen from
each rat, and prostatic epithelial cells were circled on the computer
monitor, and brown area (positive staining) and blue area (nuclei not
immunostained) in the regions were counted. The Ki-67 labeling index and
apoptosis index were obtained by dividing the brown area by the brown
area plus the blue area.
Mast cell staining. Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized with
xylene and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in 1% sodium chloride solution.
Staining with toluidine blue permits the identification of mast cells because
mast cell granules stain metachromatically, resulting in deep purplish-blue
granular cytoplasmic staining.
Mast cell and macrophage counting. The number of mast cells and
macrophages were counted at a magnification of 100 and 200,
respectively, under light microscopy. At least five regions were selected at
random for counting, and the average number in each group was
determined.
Statistics. The difference of the number of Ki-67–positive cells, caspase
3–positive cells, mast cell number, and macrophage number was analyzed
by two-sided unpaired Student’s t test and considered statistically different
when P value was <0.05. The correlation between mutation frequencies and
mast cell number and the correlation between mast cell number and Ki-67
index were analyzed by linear regression.

Results
Mutation frequencies. The mutation frequencies of the salinetreated rats (negative controls) represent the spontaneous
frequencies in each tissue. The spontaneous mutation frequencies
in the control rats were not different between the tissues
analyzed both after 4 weeks (F = 1.86; P = 0.14) or after 8 weeks
(F = 1.36; P = 0.30; one-way factorial ANOVA; Fig. 1). By contrast,
after PhIP exposure for either 4 or 8 weeks, the mutation
frequencies of the colon, spleen, seminal vesicles, and each lobe
of the prostate were significantly greater than their corresponding tissues in the control group (Fig. 1). The liver and kidneys,
which do not develop cancer in response to PhIP (11), did not
show an increase in their mutation frequencies after exposure to
PhIP (Fig. 1).
Mutation spectra. The mutation spectra of the target tissues
after 4 and 8 weeks of PhIP treatment are shown in Fig. 2. G:C !
A:T transitions, G:C ! T:A, G:C ! C:G transversions, and single
base-pair deletions were significantly increased.
The most frequently deleted base was guanine (data not shown).
Overall, these types of mutations are similar to that expected after
PhIP treatment (29–31).
Histology and histochemistry. By standard H&E staining, there
were no differences in morphology within the epithelial compartment between the various prostate lobes of the PhIP-treated and
untreated animals after either 4 or 8 weeks of exposure to PhIP.
However, when analyzed for epithelial cell proliferation in response
to PhIP treatment by immunostaining for Ki-67, the dorsolateral
and anterior lobes showed virtually no change, yet the ventral
prostate showed a marked increase in staining (Fig. 3A–F). This
increase in the proliferative fraction of epithelial cells was
statistically significant both after 4 and 8 weeks of PhIP exposure
(Fig. 3G; 4-week data is not shown). In terms of cell death, very few
apoptotic cells were seen in the ventral prostate of the salinetreated rats after 8 weeks, but when treated with PhIP, there was
an increase in apoptosis ( from 0% to f0.1%) as detected by
immunostaining for activated caspase 3 (data not shown).

Figure 2. Mutation frequency and spectra
in the cII gene after 4 wks (left) and 8 wks
(right ) of PhIP treatment. In the control
animals, G:C to A:T transition mutation was
the most frequently seen mutation. After
PhIP treatment, G:C to T:A transversions,
followed by 1-bp deletions (most of them
were guanine deletion) were the most
frequently seen types of mutation.

In the stromal compartment of the ventral prostate, standard
H&E staining revealed an increase in mononuclear cells in which
blue granules were seen in the cytoplasm. These cells were
confirmed to be mast cells by staining with toluidine blue (Fig. 4A
and B). After both 4 and 8 weeks of PhIP treatment, the number of
mast cells was significantly increased only in the ventral prostate
(Fig. 4E), and this increase correlated with the mutation
frequencies (r = 0.867; P = 0.0003). Although there was no spatial
relation between individual mast cells and proliferating epithelial
cells, as determined by Ki-67 staining with toluidine blue
counterstaining (data not shown), there was a strong correlation

between the number of mast cells and the proliferation index
(r = 0.937; P < 0.0001). The number of macrophages, which were
labeled by CD68 staining, was also increased in the ventral prostate
only both after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment with PhIP (Fig. 4C and
D). The number of macrophages also correlated with the
proliferation index (r = 0.629; P = 0.029).
Because the k class glutathione S-transferase gene (GSTP1) is
inactivated in human prostate cancer by the promoter region
CpG island hypermethylation and can prevent PhIP-induced DNA
adduct formation in human prostate cancer cells in culture (32, 33),
we also examined the pattern of GSPT1 protein expression in the

staining was seen in basal cells in all lobes, and variable and weaker
staining was noted in the luminal cells. However, no change in the
extent or pattern of GSTP1 staining was noted after PhIP treatment
at either time point.

Discussion
HCAs, of which there are at least 10 chemical forms, are produced
from amino acids, creatine/creatinine, and polysaccharide precursors during the high-temperature cooking of meats and fish (12).
PhIP, which is the most abundant of the HCAs found in cooked
meats, has been shown to be carcinogenic in the prostate, mammary
gland, intestine, and lymphoid tissue in experimental animal studies
(34–36). The major pathway of HCA activation involves phase I
hepatic cytochrome P450–mediated N-hydroxylation followed by
phase II esterification of the N-hydroxylamines to reactive ester
derivatives. These derivatives spontaneously degrade to arylnitrenium ions and form DNA adducts by covalent binding, mainly
to the C8 position of guanine. If not repaired, these DNA adducts
can result in base substitution mutations, small deletions, and small
insertions (37). Cui et al. showed that in human prostate xenografts,
PhIP-DNA adducts can be detected after exposing mice to PhIP
intragastically (38), and Nelson et al. showed that in human explants
of prostate tissues, N-hydroxy PhIP can be metabolized to adductforming derivatives (32). These studies indicate that the human
prostate can be a target of dietary PhIP-induced adducts.
In this study, we found that the colon, spleen, seminal vesicles, and
all lobes of prostate are target tissues of PhIP-induced mutations.
In these tissues, 4 weeks was sufficient to induce mutations. The type
of mutations most frequently observed were G:C to A:T transitions
followed by G:C to T:A transversions, G:C to C:G transversions, and
1-bp deletions in these target tissues. These types of mutations

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

were similar to that expected after PhIP treatment (29), suggesting
that these mutations were caused by PhIP-DNA adducts.
The tissue specificity of PhIP-induced mutations in this study
(liver and kidney did not show increases, and the prostate, seminal
vesicles, and colon did show increases) suggests that PhIP-induced
mutations require cell proliferation—liver and kidney epithelial
cells turn over extremely slowly, whereas splenocytes, colonic
epithelial cells, prostate epithelial cells, and seminal vesicle
epithelial cells have a variable yet much higher turnover rate
than the liver or kidney. However, not all of these target tissues of
PhIP-induced mutations are the target tissues of PhIP-induced
cancer (11). Despite the present study’s finding that all prostate
lobes and seminal vesicles were target tissues for mutation, only
the ventral lobe is known to develop prostate cancer in this rat
model. Nagao et al. reviewed the association between DNA
adducts, mutation, and cancer incidence and did not find a strong
correlation between mutation frequency and cancer incidence
(24). This fact suggests that whereas mutations, which are related
to the initiation of cancer, are required for malignant transformation, there must be other factors, such as tumor ‘‘promoters,’’
required for the cancer occurrence in response to PhIP.
To further examine the link between PhIP-induced mutations
and prostate lobe–specific carcinogenesis, we analyzed the
prostate lobe–specific phenotypic responses to PhIP. In the
dorsolateral prostate, anterior prostate, and seminal vesicle, there
was no change in proliferation in response to PhIP. However, in the
ventral prostate, there was a significant increase in proliferation
after exposure to PhIP. An increase in proliferation in response to
PhIP has also been reported in other target tissues. In a PhIPinduced rat mammary cancer model, proliferation of the epithelial
cells of the mammary gland terminal end buds, putative sites of
origin of carcinomas, increased after exposure to PhIP (39), and
Shirai has previously reported an increase in proliferation in all

PhIP as an Initiator and Promoter in Prostate

prostate lobes in response to PhIP (21). It is unclear why we found
in the present study an increase in proliferation only in the ventral
lobe. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that PhIP is acting as
both an initiator and promoter of cancer in the ventral prostate.
What might be responsible for this increased proliferation?
One potential mechanism may relate to the finding that PhIP has
an estrogenic effect and can stimulate cell proliferation through
estrogen receptor a (31, 40). Fujimoto et al. showed that estrogen
receptor a mRNA is expressed in the rat ventral prostate (41), and
that estrogen and testosterone together up-regulated the expression of estrogen receptor a mRNA (41). In addition, estrogen, along
with testosterone, resulted in increased expression of androgenresponsive genes (41). Estrogens can induce prostate inflammation
in the rat and have been postulated to play a role in increasing the
risk for human prostate cancer (42). Whether estrogen receptor
signaling is involved in PhIP-induced prostate carcinogenesis
awaits further study.
Another potential novel mechanism by which PhIP may indirectly
influence prostate carcinogenesis in the ventral prostate may relate
to our finding that mast cells and macrophages accumulated
selectively in the ventral prostate in response to PhIP treatment.
Recent experiments indicate that mast cell infiltration can enhance
carcinogenesis (43, 44). Mast cells contribute to the development of
skin cancer in K14-HPV16 transgenic mouse by releasing proteases,
such as tryptase and chymase, and stimulating angiogenesis (45).
In a 1,2-dimethylhydrazine–induced intestinal tumor model, the
incidence of intestinal cancer was significantly reduced in mast
cell–deficient KitW/KitW-v mice, whereas when the mast cells were
rescued by bone marrow transplantation, the cancer incidence was
the same as the normal mice treated with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine
(46). Although the mechanisms by which mast cells contribute
to carcinogenesis are not understood, mast cells play an important
role in the initiation of inflammation. Mast cells are the only tissueresident cells with granules containing preformed tumor necrosis
factor a, and releasing this cytokine from mast cells is important for
the initiation of an inflammatory response (47). In this study, along
with mast cell infiltration in the ventral prostate, the number of
macrophages was increased in the ventral prostate after PhIP
treatment. This increase of macrophages might partly be due to the
cytokines released from infiltrating mast cells. Macrophages have
been shown clearly to aid in both the initiation and progression of
experimental cancers (48–50). Although our study was conducted

for 8 weeks, we have now done additional longer term studies in
the same model system. In our preliminary analysis, we have
reproduced the findings of Shirai et al. in that the addition of PhIP
at 400 ppm to the diet for 20 weeks results in the appearance of
intraductal carcinoma lesions at 52 weeks. In this model/paradigm,
we have now found similar increases in mast cells, even at 52 weeks,
in the PhIP-treated animals. Additional work is needed to determine
whether mast cells and/or macrophages are contributing to prostate carcinogenesis in response to PhIP.
In summary, in attempts to begin to elucidate the lobe-specific
carcinogenetic effects of the dietary carcinogen PhIP on the rat
prostate, we have shown that all prostate lobes accumulate
mutations in response to short-term PhIP treatment. Thus, mutations alone, while necessary for cancer formation, do not correlate
with subsequent cancer formation. We report for the first time
that the ventral prostate selectively responded to PhIP treatment
by an increase in stromal mast cells, macrophages, and epithelial
cell proliferation. These results suggest that the inflammatory
response may help explain the tissue-specific and prostate lobe–
specific carcinogenesis in the rat prostate induced by a dietary
carcinogen.

Note Added in Proof
After the submission of this manuscript, Borowsky et al.
(Neoplasia 2006;8:708–15) reported that PhIP induces acute and
chronic inflammation in the prostate prior to inducing PIN and
intraductal cancers. Although masts cells and macrophages were
not evaluated, and the lobe specificity was not commented upon,
these results are consistent with the concept that PhIP may act in
part by inducing inflammation in the prostate.
