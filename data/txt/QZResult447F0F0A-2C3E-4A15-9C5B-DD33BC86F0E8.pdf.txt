Abstract
Infusions of natural killer (NK) cells are an emerging tool for
cancer immunotherapy. The development of clinically applicable methods to produce large numbers of fully functional
NK cells is a critical step to maximize the potential of this
approach. We determined the capacity of the leukemia cell
line K562 modified to express a membrane-bound form of
interleukin (IL)-15 and 41BB ligand (K562-mb15-41BBL) to
generate human NK cells with enhanced cytotoxicity. Sevenday coculture with irradiated K562-mb15-41BBL induced a
median 21.6-fold expansion of CD56+CD3- NK cells from
peripheral blood (range, 5.1- to 86.6-fold; n = 50), which was
considerably superior to that produced by stimulation with
IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, and/or IL-21 and caused no proliferation of
CD3+ lymphocytes. Similar expansions could also be obtained
from the peripheral blood of patients with acute leukemia
undergoing therapy (n = 11). Comparisons of the gene
expression profiles of the expanded NK cells and their
unstimulated or IL-2–stimulated counterparts showed marked
differences. The expanded NK cells were significantly more
potent than unstimulated or IL-2–stimulated NK cells against
acute myeloid leukemia cells in vitro. They could be detected
for >1 month when injected into immunodeficient mice and
could eradicate leukemia in murine models of acute myeloid
leukemia. We therefore adapted the K562-mb15-41BBL stimulation method to large-scale clinical-grade conditions,
generating large numbers of highly cytotoxic NK cells. The
results that we report here provide rationale and practical
platform for clinical testing of expanded and activated NK
cells for cell therapy of cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(9):4010–7]

Introduction
Natural killer (NK) cells can kill cancer cells in the absence of
prior stimulation and hold considerable potential for cell-based
therapies targeting human malignancies (1–4). This notion is
corroborated by the observation that, among patients with
leukemia undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,
the antileukemic effect of the transplant was significantly greater
when the donor NK cells exhibited a killer inhibitory receptor (KIR)
profile that predicted a higher cytotoxicity against the leukemic
cells of the recipient (3, 5–7). Moreover, allogeneic NK cells might

be beneficial when directly infused into patients, a procedure that
was shown to induce clinical remission in patients with high-risk
acute myeloid leukemia (AML; ref. 8). Infusions of NK cells have
also been proposed as a means to improve the treatment of other
cancers (9).
Because NK cells represent a small fraction of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, generating them in numbers sufficient to meet
clinical requirements, especially if multiple infusions are planned,
is problematic. Hence, NK cell-based therapies would greatly
benefit from reliable methods to produce large numbers of fully
functional NK cells ex vivo. Unlike T and B lymphocytes, which
readily respond to a variety of stimuli, NK cells typically do not
undergo sustained proliferation. Indeed, their reported proliferative
responses to cytokines with or without coculture with other cells
have generally been modest and of short duration in most studies
(10–16).
We previously found that the K562 leukemia cell line genetically
modified to express membrane-bound interleukin (IL)-15 and 41BB
ligand specifically activates NK cells, drives them into the cell
cycle, and allows their genetic modification (17). In this study, we
determined the capacity of NK cells stimulated by contact with
K562-mb15-41BBL cells to exert anti-AML cytotoxicity.

Materials and Methods
Cells. The AML cell lines K562, HL-60, KG1, and U937 (American Type
Culture Collection) were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) with
10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker). The K562-mb15-41BBL cell line was
made by transducing K562 cells with constructs encoding the ‘‘membranebound’’ form of IL-15 (IL-15 + CD8a) and human 41BB ligand (both
containing green fluorescent protein; ref. 17). We also transduced K562 and
U937 cells with a murine stem cell virus-green fluorescent protein vector
(from the St. Jude Vector Laboratory) containing the firefly luciferase gene
and selected them using green fluorescent protein expression and flow
cytometry.
Peripheral blood was obtained from 50 healthy adult donors. Mononuclear cells were separated on a Lymphoprep density step (Nycomed) and
washed twice in RPMI 1640. Purified unstimulated NK cells were obtained
by CD3 depletion followed by CD56 enrichment using the AutoMACS
system (Miltenyi Biotec) or the Miltenyi NK Cell Isolation Kit. Primary
leukemic cells were obtained from 9 patients with AML; peripheral blood
was obtained from 11 patients with acute leukemia (8 acute lymphoblastic
leukemia and 3 AML) in clinical remission after appropriate informed
consent and institutional review board approval.
NK cell activation and expansion. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(1.5  106) or purified NK cells (0.1  106) were incubated in a 24-well tissue
culture plate with 1  106 K562-mb15-41BBL cells and 10 IU/mL human
IL-2 (National Cancer Institute BRB Preclinical Repository) in RPMI 1640
and 10% fetal bovine serum. We called this method NK Cell Activation and
Expansion System (NKAES; Fig. 1A). Medium was exchanged every 2 days
with fresh medium and IL-2. At the end of the cultures, residual T cells were
removed with Dynabeads CD3 (Invitrogen).

median. C, Ki-67 and CD25 expression
was examined after 5 days of NKAES
culture, a stage at which cultures typically
still contain a majority of non-NK cells as
well as NK cells in their initial phase of
expansion; >90% CD56+ cells expressed
both markers, whereas CD56- cells
remained mostly Ki-67- and CD25-.

NK cell expansion stimulated by K562-mb15-41BBL cells was compared
with the results of stimulation with IL-2 (10-6,000 IU/mL), IL-12 (1-10 ng/mL;
R&D Systems), IL-15 (1-100 ng/mL; R&D Systems), and/or IL-21 (1-10 ng/mL;
Biosource International). Cytokines were added to the cultures every other
day.
Gene expression array and cell marker studies. Gene expression
was analyzed using U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix). RNA isolation, cDNA
preparation, and hybridization were done according to Affymetrix
protocols. Arrays were read with a laser confocal scanner (Agilent). Probe
intensities were measured using the MAS 5.0 algorithm, scaled to a target
intensity of 500. Probe sets called absent across all samples were excluded
and signal intensities were log-transformed. Differentially expressed genes
were identified with Linear Models for Microarray Analysis (18) implemented in Bioconductor (19), controlling the false discovery rate according
to Benjamini and Hochberg (20). Data were deposited in National Center
for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE12198).6 Cell
marker expression was done by flow cytometry using the antibodies listed
in Supplementary Table S1.
In vitro cytotoxicity assays. Target cells (1.5  105) were placed in
96-well U-bottomed tissue culture plates and incubated with NK cells at
various effector-to-target (E:T) ratios in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine
serum. Unstimulated and NKAES-NK cells were cultured with 1,000 U/mL
IL-2 for 16 h before the assay; in some experiments with NKAES-NK cells,
such addition of IL-2 was omitted. Cells were harvested after 4 h coculture
and labeled with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD13, CD15, CD34, and
CD33 antibodies and FITC-conjugated anti-CD56 (Becton Dickinson) and
analyzed by flow cytometry (17, 21). The numbers of target cells recovered
from cultures without NK cells were used as a reference.
NKAES-NK cell cytotoxicity was also assessed in 5-day cultures, with
human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells (MSC), supporting the
viability of leukemic cells (22, 23). MSC (2  104 per well) were plated
on 96-well tissue culture plates precoated with 1% gelatin. After 5 days,
2  105 primary AML cells were added followed 2 h later by NKAES-NK

cells. Cultures were done in the absence of exogenous IL-2 at 37jC in
5% CO2.
Murine models. The lifespan of NKAES-NK cells and their antileukemic
capacity was determined in 8- to 14-week-old NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIL2rgtm1Wjl/
SzJ (NOD/scid-IL2RGnull) mice (The Jackson Laboratory). NKAES-NK cells
(3  107) were injected intravenously with or without administration of
25,000 IU IL-2 intraperitoneally; their persistence was monitored with an
anti-CD45 antibody (Becton Dickinson).
Luciferase-transduced K562 or U937 cells were injected intraperitoneally
or intravenously (0.2 1  106 per mouse). T-cell depleted NKAES-NK cells
were injected intraperitoneally or intravenously (1 3  107 per mouse) as
indicated in Results. NKAES-NK cells were from the same donor when
multiple injections were administered. In some experiments, multiple
injections of NKAES-NK cells were given together with intraperitoneal
injections of IL-2 (25,000 IU each). Injections of tissue culture medium with
or without IL-2 instead of NK cells served as controls. Leukemia progression
was evaluated using a Xenogen IVIS-200 system (Caliper Life Sciences)
5 min after intraperitoneal injection of a D-luciferin potassium salt solution
(3 mg/mouse). Photons emitted were quantified using the Living Image
3.0 software.
Large-scale clinical-grade NK cell activation and expansion.
Apheresis products from 12 healthy donors were collected using a COBE
Spectra (Caridian) and processed following current Good Manufacturing
Practice (cGMP) guidelines. After centrifugation over a density gradient
(Ficoll-Paque; GE Healthcare), mononuclear cells were placed in SCGM
medium (CellGenix) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 mg/L
gentamicin sulfate (Hospira), and 10 IU/mL human IL-2 (Proleukin;
Novartis) at a concentration of 0.5  105 CD56+CD3- cells/mL. Irradiated
(100 Gy) K562-mb15-41BBL cells (from a Master Cell Bank generated
following cGMP guidelines) were added at a ratio of 1 CD56+CD3- cell to 10
K562-mb15-41BBL cells. Cells were cultured in a closed VueLife bag system
(American Fluoroseal) in a humidified incubator at 37jC, 5% CO2, with an
initial total culture volume of 60 mL/bag. Multiple bags were set up to
accommodate different numbers of mononuclear cells.
After 48 and 120 h, each cell culture bag was fed by the addition of 60 mL
fresh complete medium. Cells were harvested after 7 days. Residual T cells
were depleted using the CliniMACS System (Miltenyi), and cells were

washed and resuspended for infusion in PlasmaLyte-148 (Baxter) with
0.5% human serum albumin (pharmaceutical grade). Quality control and
product release testing include flow cytometry (CD56 and CD3), sterility
(Gram stain and culture), endotoxin, and Mycoplasma.

Results
Expansion of human NK cells. When peripheral blood
mononuclear cells from 50 healthy donors were placed in NKAES
cultures, median CD56+CD3- cell recovery after 7 days was 21.6-fold
(range, 5.1- to 86.6-fold) of the input cells (Fig. 1B). Expansion of
CD3+ T cells was minimal (median recovery, 1.2-fold; range, 0.3- to
3.7-fold). The specific stimulation of NK cells was corroborated by
analysis of the expression of Ki-67, a marker of cell proliferation,
and CD25, the IL-2 receptor a-chain, after 5 days of culture. More
than 90% CD56+CD3- cells expressed both markers, whereas
CD56-cells remained mostly Ki-67- and CD25- (Fig. 1C). NK cell
recovery increased to 152-fold (70- to 744-fold; n = 5) after 14 days
and 277-fold (201- to 1,459-fold) after 21 days of culture. Median
percentage of CD56+CD3- cells was 62.9% (31.0-92.1%) on day 7,
90.0% (72.7-96.5%) on day 14, and 96.8% (75.6-98.0%) on day 21; that
of CD3+ T cells was 29.1% (4.5-64.3%), 8.3% (3.0-17.3%), and 3.1%
(1.8-23.4%), respectively. K562-mb15-41BBL cells produced significantly higher NK cell expansions than K562 cells alone or K562
cells expressing either mb15 or 41BBL (data not shown; ref. 17).
NKAES-NK cells maintained heterogeneous expression of KIR
molecules (n = 3; Supplementary Fig. S1A). NK cells expressing KIR
molecules (KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2/3, and KIR3DL1) and those lacking
these molecules expanded equally in NKAES cultures (n = 6;
Supplementary Fig. S1B).

NKAES cultures could also expand NK cells from patients with
acute leukemia as shown by experiments with peripheral blood
obtained from 8 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and
3 with AML undergoing chemotherapy but in clinical remission.
Median 7-day NK cell expansion was 17.3-fold (range, 3.6- to 142.5fold), a rate similar to that observed with NK cells from healthy
adult donors.
IL-2 alone at 10 IU/mL induced no significant expansion of
CD56+CD3- cells (median, 1.1-fold; range, 0.2- to 4-fold; n = 18);
increasing IL-2 concentration to 100 IU-1,000 IU/mL resulted in
only slightly higher recoveries (median, 2.0-fold; range, 1.0- to
3.2-fold; n = 7). Likewise, 6,000 IU/mL IL-2 resulted in a 7-day
median recovery of 1.3-fold (range, 1.1- to 1.3-fold; n = 4). Addition
of IL-15 (1-100 ng/mL) to 7-day cultures containing 10 to 20 IU/mL
IL-2 did not improve NK cell expansion (median, 1.3-fold; range,
0.3- to 5.8-fold; n = 22). We also tested the stimulatory effects of
IL-12 (1-10 ng/mL; n = 6), IL-21 (1-10 ng/mL; n = 6), and these
cytokines in various combinations with IL-2 and IL-15 (n = 7) with
no significant improvement over recoveries obtained with single
stimuli.
Genetic features of NKAES-NK cells. We compared the global
gene expression profiles of NKAES-NK cells (n = 5) with those of
unstimulated (n = 5) and IL-2–stimulated purified CD56+CD3- NK
cells (n = 6). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis correctly
clustered unstimulated, IL-2–stimulated, and NKAES-NK cells in
three distinct groups (Fig. 2A). The differences in gene expression
profile of NKAES-NK cells and that of unstimulated or IL-2–
stimulated NK cells was further corroborated by supervised
clustering analyses (Fig. 2B and C).

Figure 2. Gene expression analysis of unstimulated,
IL-2–stimulated, and NKAES-NK cells. Unstimulated
NK cells (n = 5) were studied immediately after
immunomagnetic separation of CD56+CD3- cells.
IL-2–stimulated cells (n = 6) and NKAES-NK cells
(n = 5) were studied after 7 days of culture. Two
concentrations of IL-2 were used: 200 IU/mL (n = 3)
and 6,000 IU/mL (n = 3). A, unsupervised hierarchical
clustering analysis resulted in three major clusters,
each containing all unstimulated (Unstimul. ), IL-2–
stimulated, and NKAES-NK samples. IL-2–stimulated
NK samples were in one major cluster regardless of the
IL-2 concentration used (brown line, 200 IU/mL; green
line, 6,000 IU/mL). B, supervised clustering analysis of
NKAES-NK cells compared with unstimulated NK cells.

Expansion of Highly Cytotoxic NK Cells

molecules differentially expressed by gene array analysis. Overlay histograms show results of one of three representative experiments. B, expression of natural
cytotoxicity receptors (NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46), NKG2D, and its ligands (MICA/B, ULBP1, ULBP2, and ULBP3).

After excluding probe sets whose maximum expression signal
was <500 and setting a false discovery rate threshold of <0.05, 5,841
probe sets were differentially expressed by z2-fold in NKAES-NK
and unstimulated NK cells; 2,697 were overexpressed in NKAES-NK
cells and 3,144 were underexpressed. Using the same parameters,
there were 915 probe sets differentially expressed by z2-fold
between NKAES-NK and IL-2–stimulated NK cells; 366 were
overexpressed in NKAES-NK cells and 549 were underexpressed.
Differentially expressed genes included genes encoding cytokines
and chemokines, cytokine and chemokine receptors, adhesion
molecules, and molecules involved in T-cell stimulation (Supplementary Tables S2-S5). Differential expression of some of these
molecules was confirmed by staining with specific antibodies and
flow cytometry (Fig. 3A). We also studied the expression of natural
cytotoxicity receptors (NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46), NKG2D, and
its ligands (MICA/B, ULBP1, ULBP2, and ULBP3) by flow cytometry
in cells from three donors (Fig. 3B). Notable differences were the
higher expression of NKG2D in NKAES-NK cells and that of NKp44
in IL-2–stimulated cells.
Cytotoxicity of expanded NK cells against AML cells. The
cytotoxicity of NKAES-NK cells from 12 healthy donors was tested

www.aacrjournals.org

against the AML cell lines K562, KG1, U937, and HL-60. NKAES-NK
cells were consistently cytotoxic even when NK cells were outnumbered by target cells (Fig. 4A). We also tested the cytotoxicity of
NKAES-NK cells from 3 patients with acute leukemia. The cytotoxicities observed were similar to those recorded with NKAES-NK
cells derived from healthy donors (Supplementary Fig. S2).
We then tested NKAES-NK cell cytotoxicity against primary
leukemic cells from 9 newly diagnosed patients with AML
representative of the spectrum of AML subtypes (4 M1, 1 M2, 2
M4, 1 M5, and 1 M7). NK cells from 9 healthy donors were included
in these studies for a total of 22 experiments. NKAES-NK cells were
highly effective against primary AML cells overall. For example,
mean F SD cytotoxicity after 4 h coculture at a 2:1 E:T ratio was
43 F 18% (Fig. 4B). To determine whether NKAES-NK cells were
cytotoxic at very low E:T ratio in prolonged cultures, we cultured
them with AML cells from 5 patients in the presence of bone
marrow-derived MSC layers (to prevent spontaneous apoptosis
of the AML cells). After 5 days of culture at a 1:10 E:T ratio,
cytotoxicity was higher than 50% for 4 of the samples (Fig. 4C). In
2 of the 5 cases, considerable cytotoxicity (39% and 47%) were
observed in cultures in which the E:T ratio was 1:100.

In the above experiments, there was no visible damage to the
MSC. Nevertheless, we specifically tested the effect of NKAES-NK
cells from 4 donors against allogeneic MSC in 4 h (n = 2) or 5 day
cultures (n = 2). In all experiments, cytotoxicity was consistently
<20% even at E:T ratios of 8:1. NKAEAS NK cells (from 2 other
donors) also lacked cytotoxicity against allogeneic T cells: in assays
lasting 4 to 24 h, cytotoxicity was always <20% at 8:1 or lower E:T
ratios. Thus, NKAES cultures do not appear to significantly
enhance the cytotoxicity of NK cells against nontransformed cells.
Cytotoxicity of NKAES-NK cells compared with that of
unstimulated and IL-2–stimulated NK cells. Using K562, HL-60,
U937, and KG1 cells as targets, we directly tested the relative
cytotoxicity of NKAES-NK cells and of freshly isolated
CD56+CD3-cells from the same donors (n = 12). NKAES-NK cells
were significantly more cytotoxic than their unstimulated counterparts regardless of the E:T ratio (Fig. 5A).
Early studies had indicated that IL-2 enhances the cytotoxicity of
NK cells, with maximum effects achieved within 18 h incubation
(10, 24). Moreover, infusion of allogeneic NK cells exposed to
1,000 IU/mL IL-2 overnight have been shown to exert antileukemic
activity in AML patients (8).We therefore exposed unstimulated
and NKAES-NK cells to 1,000 IU/mL IL-2 for 16 h and then
compared their cytotoxicity against AML cell lines. NKAES-NK cells
were more powerful overall (Fig. 5B). We next performed similar
comparisons with NK cells stimulated for 7 days with 6,000 IU/mL
IL-2. Increase IL-2 stimulation appeared to enhance cytotoxicity
of NK cells, but median cytotoxicities produced by NKAES-NK cells
remained the highest at all E:T ratios and were significantly higher
at 1:2 and 1:4 E:T (Fig. 5C). Finally, we determined whether
exposure of NKAES-NK to 1,000 IU/mL IL-2 for 16 h was important
to achieve the high cytotoxicities observed. In experiments with
NKAES-NK cells from 3 donors tested against K562, HL-60, KG1,

and U937, there were no significant differences with and without
the additional incubation with IL-2 (data not shown).
Cytotoxicity of NKAES-NK cells in vivo. NKAES-NK cells
injected intravenously into immunodeficient mice were detectable
in peripheral blood after 4 days, representing 0.78 F 0.52% or
10.1 F 6.7/mm3 (mean F SD; n = 6) of mononuclear cells, but
decreased to <0.1% (1.5/mm3) on day 10 and became undetectable
thereafter. By contrast, when injection of NKAES-NK cells was
accompanied by intraperitoneal injection of IL-2 (25,000 IU; daily
during the first week and once every 2 days in the following weeks),
the percentage of NK cells was much higher: 6.2 F 4.1% on day 4,
7.0 F 2.5% on day 17, and 8.4 F 3.9% on day 24 (106.2 F 69.3/mm3,
179.3 F 65.0/mm3, and 215.5 F 98.9/mm3, respectively). They were
still detectable on day 31 at f0.1% and became undetectable on
day 38.
We then generated murine models of AML by injecting
luciferase-labeled AML cell lines in immunodeficient (NOD/scidIL2RGnull) mice. K562 and U937 cells (0.2-1  106) promptly
engrafted in these mice regardless of whether they were injected
intraperitoneally or intravenously. In initial experiments, we
injected K562 intraperitoneally or intravenously followed by
intraperitoneal injection of 1  107 NKAES-NK cells 1 day later.
Results were compared with those for mice injected with K562 cells
in the same way but not treated with NK cells. In all of the mice
injected with NKAES-NK cells, there was a marked suppression of
leukemic cell growth and/or a decrease in the leukemic cell burden,
although the growth of AML cells eventually progressed (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Mice engrafted with either K562 or U937 cells were also treated
with multiple injections of NKAES-NK cells and IL-2. As illustrated
in Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S4, disease progression in mice
treated with NK cells was either substantially delayed or completely

abrogated, with several mice achieving long-term remissions and
no apparent signs of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. Finally,
we tested whether initiation of NKAES-NK cell therapy 11 days
after injecting mice with AML cells would still result in an
antileukemic effect. NKAES-NK cells had a significantly antileukemic effect also with this schedule, although they did not eradicate
leukemia (Supplementary Fig. S5). These results confirm the
antileukemic capacity of NKAES-NK cells and suggest that multiple
infusions of NK cells are likely to be required to maximize their
therapeutic effect.
Generation of clinical-grade expanded NK cells. We developed a Master Cell Bank of K562-mb15-41BBL cells following
cGMP guidelines. We used these cells to stimulate the expansion of
NK cells from apheresis products under clinical-grade large-scale
conditions. Expansion of CD56+CD3- cells ranged from 33- to 141fold (median, 90.5-fold; n = 12) after 7 days of culture (Supplementary Table S6). On day 7, CD56+CD3- cells represented 83.1% (range,
72.9-85.9%) of the resulting cell population; CD56+CD3+ NK/T cells
were 3.2% (1.7-9.5%) and CD56-CD3+ T lymphocytes were 9.1%
(5.6-13.5%; Supplementary Table S6); the remaining cells were B
cells and monocytes. Therefore, the overall NK cell yield in these
experiments was higher than that observed in small-scale experiments (Fig. 1B). Comparative experiments (data not shown)
indicated that this difference was attributable to the use of SCGM
tissue culture medium, instead of RPMI 1640, in the large-scale
expansions, a medium that appears to be well suited to support
NK cell growth (25). The resulting NK cells were indistinguishable
from NK cells expanded under the original culture conditions;
their cytotoxicity against the AML cell lines K562, U937, HL-60,
and KG1 was within the range of the cytotoxicities observed with

the cells obtained with small-scale NKAES cultures (data not
shown). Thus, large numbers of highly cytotoxic NK cells can be
generated under conditions that meet clinical and regulatory
requirements for cell therapy.

Discussion
We found that K562-mb15-41BBL cells induce sustained and
specific proliferation of human NK cells. NK cell expansion was
observed in all donors tested, including patients with acute
leukemia undergoing therapy, with no apparent proliferative
advantage of any particular NK cell subset. Gene expression of
NKAES-NK cells was markedly different than that of unstimulated
and IL-2-stimulated cells not only in regards to their expression of
cell proliferation-associated genes but also in that of molecules
that might regulate NK cell function and their interaction with
other cell types. NKAES-NK cells had powerful cytotoxicity against
AML cell lines and AML cells from patients and were more potent
than unstimulated or IL-2-activated NK cells from the same
donors. Based on these findings, and on the effectiveness of
NKAES-NK cells in murine models of AML, we developed a Master
Cell Bank of K562-mb15-41BBL cells under cGMP guidelines and
showed that large-scale expansion and activation of human NK
cells for clinical studies was feasible, producing expansions of
CD56+CD3- cells that were even higher than those observed in the
initial small-scale experiments while maintaining high anti-AML
cytotoxicity.
IL-2 can induce proliferative responses in human NK cells, but
only a minor fraction sustains continued growth (10, 26, 27).
Conceivably, some NK cell subsets might be more responsive as

the same donors were tested in each comparison.

Figure 6. Antileukemic activity of NKAES-NK cells in vivo . NOD/scid-IL2RGnull mice (n = 6) were injected with K562 cells expressing luciferase (2  105)
intraperitoneally. Then, NKAES-NK cells (1  107) from the same donor were injected every 2 days intraperitoneally in 3 mice, from days 1 to 11 after K562 injection.
All 6 mice received 25,000 IU IL-2 intraperitoneally daily for 3 weeks. A, leukemia cell growth was visualized through luciferin injection and Xenogen imaging
(ventral is shown). Leukemia progressed in all 3 mice not treated with NK cells (top ) and mice were euthanized between days 37 and 44. By contrast, leukemia
progression was not apparent in 2 of the 3 mice receiving NK cells, which remain alive and leukemia-free 8 months after the beginning of the experiment; in a third
mouse, leukemia became detectable on day 43 (the mouse was euthanized on day 70; bottom ). B, signal intensities (photons/s) detected in control mice (left)

suggested by early reports of up to 50-fold expansion after culture
with IL-2 for 2 weeks of a NK subset that adheres to plastic
(28–31). It is unclear, however, whether some CD3+ cells might have
had, at least in part, contributed to the increased cell numbers
(29, 30). More recently, anti-CD3 and IL-2 reportedly induced 190fold NK expansions after 21 days from the blood of healthy
individuals (32) and, surprisingly, 1,600-fold expansions after 20
days from that of patients with myeloma (25). However, the
cytotoxicity of these cells against K562 cells was <10% at 1:1 E:T (25),
a ratio at which NKAES-NK cells from healthy donors or leukemia
patients had a median cytotoxicity of 69% cells. Our results with IL-2
alone or in combination with other cytokines are in line with those
of earlier reports (10, 26, 27, 33). Indeed, most investigators have
indicated that sustained expansions of CD56+CD3- cells require
additional signals (14, 16), such as the presence of B-lymphoblastoid
cells (26, 34, 35). B-lymphoblastoid cells, however, also induce
vigorous expansions of T lymphocytes, whereas NKAES cultures do
not stimulate T-cell proliferation. In the setting of allogeneic NK cell
therapy, this could be an important practical advantage as it would
facilitate the complete removal of residual T cells at the end of the
cultures (to avoid the risk of graft-versus-host disease). Because
K562-mb15-41BBL cells are lethally irradiated before culture and
they are lysed by the expanding NK cells, the risk of infusing viable
K562-mb15-41BBL is negligible. Nevertheless, we have incorporated
safeguards in our clinical protocol. We prepare cultures of irradiated

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (9). May 1, 2009

K562-mb15-41BBL cells and monitor their growth and DNA
synthesis rate. We also test for the presence of viable K562-mb1541BBL cells at the end of the culture by flow cytometry using green
fluorescent protein as a marker. The clinical product is released
only if there is no cell growth and no viable of K562-mb15-41BBL
cell at the end of the cultures.
Most patients with AML respond to initial treatment and achieve
remission, but occult resistant leukemia persists in approximately
half of the patients, leading to overt (and usually fatal) relapse
(36, 37). NK cell infusions have shown to be clinically effective in
patients with high-risk AML (8); they are being considered for the
therapy of other hematologic malignancies (9, 38). Conceivably,
NK cell therapy will be most powerful when the number of NK
cells infused is sufficiently high to produce a high E:T ratio. In our
murine models of AML, multiple injections of NKAES-derived
cells were required to eradicate leukemia and achieve long-term
remissions. The number of NK cells that can be generated with the
method that we describe should meet the requirement for a high
E:T ratio, particularly in the setting of minimal residual disease,
and allow multiple NK cell infusions. We found that administration
of IL-2 significantly prolonged the survival of NKAES-NK cells in
immunodeficient mice. It is possible that other cytokines not yet
available for clinical studies, such as IL-15, might prove to be
superior for this purpose. Of note, it was shown in clinical studies
that lymphodepletion of the recipients, a procedure essential to

ensure prolonged engraftment of the infused cells (39), resulted in
high levels of serum IL-15 (8).
Although infusion of allogeneic unstimulated or IL-2-stimulated
NK cells has been proven to be safe, with no significant graft-versushost disease detected, the safety of NKAES-NK cell infusions must
be established. To this end, we have begun a phase I dose-escalation
clinical study of haploidentical NKAES-NK cells in patients with
refractory leukemia. In addition to AML and other hematologic
malignancies, some solid tumors should also be susceptible to NK
cell cytotoxicity (9). Therefore, patients with these malignancies
could also be eligible for clinical studies of NK cell therapy.
