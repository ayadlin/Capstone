ABSTRACT
Gli transcription factors of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway have been reported to
be drivers of malignant mesothelioma (MMe) cell survival. The Gli inhibitor GANT61
induces apoptosis in various cancer cell models, and has been associated directly
with Gli inhibition. However various chemotherapeutics can induce cell death
through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) but whether ROS mediates
GANT61-induced apoptosis is unknown. In this study human MMe cells were treated
with GANT61 and the mechanisms regulating cell death investigated. Exposure of
MMe cells to GANT61 led to G1 phase arrest and apoptosis, which involved ROS
but not its purported targets, GLI1 or GLI2. GANT61 triggered ROS generation and
quenching of ROS protected MMe cells from GANT61-induced apoptosis. Furthermore,
we demonstrated that mitochondria are important in mediating GANT61 effects:
(1) ROS production and apoptosis were blocked by mitochondrial inhibitor rotenone;
(2) GANT61 promoted superoxide formation in mitochondria; and (3) mitochondrial
DNA-deficient LO68 cells failed to induce superoxide, and were more resistant to
apoptosis induced by GANT61 than wild-type cells. Our data demonstrate for the
first time that GANT61 induces apoptosis by promoting mitochondrial superoxide
generation independent of Gli inhibition, and highlights the therapeutic potential of
mitochondrial ROS-mediated anticancer drugs in MMe.

The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a conserved
signaling pathway responsible for the regulation of pattern
specification during embryonic development [3]. It is
also involved in the control of adult tissue homeostasis
and stem cell maintenance [4]. For Hh signaling, the
Hh protein acts as a ligand for the Patched1 (PTCH1)
transmembrane receptor proteins [5]. PTCH1 interaction
with transmembrane signal transducer Smoothened (SMO)
under normal conditions inhibits SMO function [6]. Upon
binding of Hh ligand to PTCH1, the inhibition of SMO
by PTCH1 is alleviated, resulting in the activation of Gli

INTRODUCTION
Malignant mesothelioma (MMe) is an aggressive
fatal cancer, predominantly of the pleura and peritoneum,
primarily caused by occupational asbestos exposure [1].
Current approaches involving surgery, radiotherapy or
chemotherapy have failed to bring a clear survival benefit
to patients, with a median survival of less than 12 months
from diagnosis [2]. Clearly, new therapeutic strategies are
urgently needed to improve the survival rate and quality
of life of these patients.

transcription factors, capable of regulating expression of
Hh target genes [7].
Several small molecule compounds with inhibitory
effects on the Hh pathway have been reported. Notably,
US FDA has approved GDC-0449, a SMO antagonist, for
the treatment of patients with advanced stages of basal
cell carcinoma [8]. Besides targeting SMO, the Hh ligand
and Gli transcription factors appear highly amenable to
inhibition by small molecule inhibitors. Of particular
interest is GANT61, discovered in a cell-based screen for
antagonists of Gli-mediated transcription [9]. GANT61
induces apoptosis in various human cancer cells including
MMe [10–13] and suppresses the growth of prostate
carcinoma [9] and neuroblastoma [14] xenografts in mice,
suggesting that Gli proteins could be a therapeutic target
in these cancers. The cytotoxic effect of GANT61 was
previously attributed to the inhibition of Gli binding to
DNA [9], thus preventing the transcription of Hh target
genes such as Bcl-2 [10, 15], which are involved in cell
proliferation and apoptosis. Recent studies showed that
GANT61 induced autophagic death in hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) cells through upregulation of Bnip3
[16]. However, it is unclear whether GANT61 have effects
independent of Hh/Gli signaling.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are traditionally
viewed as toxic molecules that damage cellular DNA,
proteins and lipids [17]. However recently, ROS have
been shown to have important physiological signaling
functions [18]. Generation of ROS in response to

chemo- and radio-therapy has been reported to induce
cell cycle arrest and/or cell death in various cancer
models [19]. However, whether GANT61 induces
ROS generation has not been reported. Therefore, we
examined the role of ROS in mediating GANT61induced apoptosis and determined if this occurred via
Hh/Gli signaling.

RESULTS
GANT61 induces G1 cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis in human MMe cells
The antiproliferative activity of GANT61 was assessed
in MMe cells. GANT61 inhibited cell proliferation in all
MMe cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1A).
Among the cell lines tested, JU77 cells showed highest
sensitivity to GANT61 treatment (IC50 = 4.02 μM) whereas
NO36 cells appeared to be the most resistant (IC50 = 31.8
μM) (Figure 1A). As shown in Figure 1B, concomitant with
growth inhibitory effect, GANT61 induced G1 cell cycle
arrest as indicated by the increased percentage of LO68
cells in G1 cell cycle phase at 24 h compared to vehicletreated cells. There was also an accumulation of cells in
the sub-G1 fraction at 48–72 h compared to vehicle-treated
cells, suggesting that apoptosis is involved (Figure 1C). To
understand the cell death response to GANT61 in LO68 cells,
cells were treated with GANT61 and phosphatidylserine
externalization, a marker of early apoptosis, determined.

GANT61 induced a parallel increase in apoptotic cell death
in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as indicated by FACS
analysis of annexin V-binding (Figure 1D).

Consistent with previous findings, GANT61 inhibited
the Gli reporter activity in LO68 cells (Figure 2C). These
findings point to GANT61 being an inhibitor of GLI1 and
GLI2 [9].

GANT61 targets Gli transcription factors in
MMe cells

GANT61 induces oxidative stress

GANT61 reduced mRNA expression of GLI1 and
GLI2 following treatment with 20 μM GANT61 for up
to 72 h (Figure 2A) as well as the Gli downstream target
gene PTCH1 (Figure 2A). A similar downregulation
of GLI1 and GLI2 proteins was observed after 24
h exposure to different concentrations of GANT61
(10–30 μM) (Figure 2B). The protein level of Bcl-2, a
GLI1 downstream target gene [20], was also reduced
after GANT61 treatment (Figure 2B). To confirm the
specificity of inhibition of GLI1 and GLI2 by GANT61,
we tested its efficacy in a Gli luciferase reporter assay.

Previous studies showed that GANT61 can induce
DNA damage in colon cancer cells [10]. We hypothesize
that GANT61 triggers the production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), which in turn damages DNA. To test this
hypothesis, cells were treated with GANT61 (10–20 μM)
for 24 to 48 h and intracellular ROS levels were measured
using the carboxy derivative of fluorescein, CH2DCFDA.
As shown in Figure 3A, ROS levels increased significantly
in LO68 cells treated with GANT61 in a dose- and
time-dependent manner. GANT61 also triggered ROS
generation in HCT116 and HT29 colon cancer cells,

GANT61 downregulates GLI1, GLI2 and
PTCH1 through ROS

suggesting that the production of ROS could be a general
effect of GANT61 exposure (Figure 3B). Moreover,
pretreatment of LO68 cells with N-acetylcysteine
(NAC) and reduced L-glutathione (GSH), two potent
ROS scavengers, attenuated this accumulation of ROS
(Figure 3C). As shown in Figure 3D, neutralization of
ROS by NAC in GANT61-treated cells restored cell
viability, suggesting that ROS is responsible for GANT61
cytotoxicity. Consistent with this data, annexin V/7AAD
assays showed that NAC pretreatment rescued LO68 cells
from GANT61-induced apoptosis (Figure 3E).

We next examined the effect of NAC on GANT61mediated GLI1, GLI2 and PTCH1 expression. As shown in
Figure 4A, the downregulation of GLI1, GLI2 and PTCH1
expression by GANT61, as determined by qRT-PCR, was
abolished by pretreating cells with NAC. The blockade of
ROS accumulation by NAC prevents reduction of GLI1,
GLI2 and PTCH1 expression indicating the involvement
of ROS in modulation of the Hh pathway. Stimulated by
our novel finding that ROS could potentially impact on

GANT61-induced ROS, apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest are independent of Gli inhibition

the Hh pathway, we next assessed the effect of exposing
LO68 cells to menadione, a ROS generator, and hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2), a mimic of oxidative stress, on the Hh
pathway. FACS analysis of intracellular ROS production
indicated that exposure of LO68 cells to menadione and
H2O2 resulted in a significant increase in ROS production as
measured by the fluorescent CH2DCFDA probe (Figure 4B
and 4C). Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis of gene
expression in LO68 cells following treatment clearly
indicated the ability of menadione and H2O2 to
downregulate the expression of GLI1, a marker of Hh
pathway activity (Figure 4D and 4E). Together, these
findings suggest that ROS plays a critical role in the
suppression of GLI1, GLI2 and PTCH1 expression by
GANT61.

Because GANT61 is an inhibitor of Gli transcription
factors, we set out to determine whether GANT61-induced
G1 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and ROS production are
dependent on Gli inhibition. First, we examined apoptosis
and ROS production in LO68 cells following siRNAmediated depletion of GLI1 and GLI2. qRT-PCR analyses
demonstrated knockdowns of GLI1 and GLI2 mRNA in
LO68 cells (Figure 5A). Surprisingly however, neither
individual GLI1 or GLI2 knockdowns nor their combined
depletion induced cell death as indicated by the small
sub-G1 apoptotic population (< 5% in sub-G1 phase in
GLI1- and/or GLI2-depleted cells compared to ~5% cells

in sub-G1 phase in LO68 cells transiently transfected with
negative control (NC) siRNA), indicating that the proapoptotic activity of the drug is likely to be independent
of Gli inhibition (Figure 5B). Similarly, the results from
FACS analysis showed that the knockdowns of GLI1
and GLI2 by siRNA did not result in G1 cell cycle arrest
(~60% in G1 phase in GLI1- and/or GLI2-depleted
cells compared to ~60% cells in G1 phase in LO68 cells
transiently transfected with NC siRNA) (Figure 5C).
Moreover, depletion of GLI1 and GLI2, individually or
together using siRNAs did not result in ROS generation in
LO68 cells (Figure 5D). Taken together, our data suggest
that generation of ROS and induction of apoptosis and
cell cycle arrest in response to GANT61 is independent of
Hh/Gli signaling in LO68 cells.

and apoptosis (Figure 6B) were significantly blocked by
the addition of rotenone, indicating that the ROS produced
in response to GANT61 was of mitochondrial origin.
The addition of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant,
MitoTEMPO, also blocked the increase in apoptosis
induced by GANT61 (Figure 6C). We further confirm the
mitochondrial origin of ROS by measuring the levels of
superoxide within mitochondria after exposure to GANT61
using the fluorescent probe mitoSOX red. As shown in
Figure 6D, exposure to 20 μM GANT61 for 48 h induced
an increase in intramitochondrial superoxide levels. In
addition, this increase in intramitochondrial superoxide was
attenuated by pretreating cells for 1 h with 20 mM NAC
before co-treating with 20 μM GANT61 (Figure 6D).

To genetically confirm involvement of mitochondrial
superoxide in GANT61-induced apoptosis, we generated
LO68 ρ0 cells, which lack mitochondrial DNA, by
exposing cells to low concentration of ethidium bromide.
Mitochondrial DNA depletion was verified in LO68

COX1, D-loop and ND6, by PCR. In addition, GADPH was
amplified to serve as a control for nuclear-encoded genes. As

shown in Figure 7A, ethidium bromide treatment resulted in
a marked reduction of PCR products for COX1, D-loop and
ND6. There was no difference in the levels of GAPDH PCR
product between LO68 and LO68 ρ0 cells, indicating that
nuclear DNA was not depleted in the process of establishing
LO68 ρ0 cells (Figure 7A). Next, LO68 and LO68 ρ0 cells
were treated with GANT61 (10–20 μM) for 48 h before
staining with mitoSOX red. In LO68 cells, exposure to
GANT61 for 48 h resulted in an induction of mitochondrial
superoxide formation. MitoSOX red oxidation was
significantly reduced in LO68 ρ0 cells, indicating that a
functional respiratory chain is required for the GANT61
induction of superoxide formation (Figure 7B). To determine
whether functional mitochondrial respiratory chain is
important for mediating GANT61-induced apoptosis, we
compared apoptosis in LO68 and LO68 ρ0 cells exposed
to GANT61 (10 and 20 μM) for 48 h. As shown in
Figure 7C, GANT61 increased apoptosis in a dosedependent manner in LO68 cells as assessed by annexin V
staining. In contrast, GANT61 induced negligible apoptosis
in LO68 ρ0 cells after exposure to GANT61. Furthermore,
to exclude the possibility that LO68 ρ0 cells were resistant to
apoptosis because of their loss of a functional mitochondrial
respiratory chain, LO68 and LO68 ρ0 cells were treated
with cisplatin (10 and 20 μM), a standard chemotherapeutic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

drug known to induce apoptosis in LO68 cells, for 48 h, and
apoptosis was assessed by annexin V staining. As shown in
Figure 7D, LO68 and LO68 ρ0 cells undergo apoptosis when
treated with cisplatin. Also there was no statistical difference
in the level of apoptosis between LO68 and LO68 ρ0 cells as
demonstrated by annexin V assay (p > 0.05). Taken together,
these results suggest that GANT61-induced apoptosis is
mediated by mitochondrial superoxide.

DISCUSSION
Targeting the Hh pathway either through RNAinterference knockdown of GLI1 and GLI2 or using Gli
inhibitors, has been shown to induce growth inhibition and
cell death in mesothelioma cells and xenograft tumors in
vivo [13, 21, 22]. A promising anticancer agent GANT61,
with Gli inhibitory activity, displayed potent cytotoxic
activity against diverse human cancer types including
MMe [13–15, 23–25]. On the basis of computational
docking and surface plasmon resonance data, GANT61
has been proposed to mediate its pro-apoptotic effect by
binding directly to GLI1, which in turn inhibits GLI1 from
binding to DNA [9, 26]. There is evidence that GANT61
appears to have a novel anticancer mechanism that differs
from other Hh antagonists. Recent studies have reported

that GANT61 triggers apoptosis via induction of DNA
double strand breaks and activation of ATM-Chk2 DNA
damage response in colon cancer cells [10, 27].
Using a panel of MMe cell lines, we have
demonstrated that GANT61-induced anti-proliferative
effects were related to the inhibition of cell growth, as
confirmed by reduction of cell growth and induction of G1
cell cycle arrest. Our data also show that GANT61 induced
apoptotic cell death in LO68 cells in a concentrationand time-dependent manner. We present data indicating
that GANT61 specifically acts on the Hh-Gli pathway,
as demonstrated by a reduction in the expression levels
of downstream pathway effectors GLI1 and GLI2 and
Gli target genes PTCH1 and Bcl-2. GANT61 also
significantly decreased the Gli-luciferase reporter activity
in a dose-dependent manner. These results are consistent
with previous reports in HEK294 cells transiently
overexpressing GLI1 and colon cancer cells with
constitutively active Hh signaling [9, 15]. At this juncture,
our data corroborate previous findings that GANT61
inhibits Hh signaling at the level of Gli transcription
factors [9, 14, 15]. However, silencing GLI1 and GLI2,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

individually or together, were not sufficient to induce cell
death in LO68 cells, strongly suggesting that GANT61induced apoptosis was not associated with Gli inhibition.
Our data is in contrast to previous siRNA experiments,
where silencing of GLI1 resulted in increased apoptosis
and reduced level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in HCC, glioma
and breast cancer cells [28–30]. Thus, it is possible that
GANT61-induced apoptosis may be initiated by another
factor other than Gli inhibition.
An alternative explanation for Gli-independent
induction of apoptosis by GANT61 is production of ROS.
Previous reports have shown that certain chemotherapeutic
drugs can induce caspase-independent apoptosis that
is brought about by the production of ROS [31, 32].
The present studies showed that ROS were generated
concomitantly with apoptosis in a dose- and timedependent manner in LO68 cells upon treatment of cells
with GANT61. Interestingly, similar to GANT61-induced
apoptosis, Gli silencing by siRNA showed that although
GLI1 and GLI2 were downregulated in LO68 cells, they did
not appear to be involved in induction of ROS generation.
Furthermore, the apoptogenic role of ROS production was

However, it is hard to determine the specific ROS species
that are generated from GANT61 exposure in LO68
cells. It seems likely that the superoxide produced in the
mitochondria might play an important role in the induction
of apoptosis. Approximately 1–2% of electrons can “leak”
to oxygen to form superoxide in a reaction mediated mainly
by complex I and III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain
[33]. To identify the source of ROS, rotenone, a complex
I inhibitor, was able to reduce GANT61-induced ROS
production and rescue LO68 cells from GANT61-induced
apoptosis when it was added to cells prior to GANT61
exposure. This result implied that GANT61-induced ROS
might come from mitochondria. Because the blockade of
GANT61-induced apoptosis by rotenone was partial, there
could also be other sites of ROS production. Another major
site of ROS generation is plasma membrane NADPH
oxidase [34].
Mitochondrial DNA-depleted ρ° cells lack a working
respiratory chain and are not able to generate ATP and ROS
within mitochondria [35, 36]. We thus hypothesized that
the depletion of mitochondrial DNA in LO68 ρ° cells may
interfere with ROS production and in turn apoptosis, after
treatment with GANT61. Consistent with our hypothesis,
LO68 ρ° cells showed resistance to GANT61, and lower
mitochondrial superoxide levels were also observed after
GANT61 treatment. The resistance of LO68 ρ° cells to
GANT61 was not associated with a decreased susceptibility
to apoptosis, as indicated by the equal sensitivity to
cisplatin of wild-type and ρ° cells. Overall, our results
are consistent with the hypothesis that susceptibility to
GANT61 stems from exaggerated production of ROS from
the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

In conclusion, the present study not only demonstrates
the therapeutic potential of GANT61 in MMe, but also
demonstrates a novel mechanism for GANT61-induced
G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in MMe cells. This is the first
report of apoptosis induced by GANT61 via generation of
mitochondrial ROS. Based on the findings in this paper, we
propose a model showing the relationship of GANT61, ROS
and mitochondria in the induction of growth suppression and
apoptosis of MMe cells (Figure 8). Our results offer an initial
proof-of-concept that mitochondrial ROS-mediated anticancer
mechanisms may be exploited for therapeutic benefits in MMe.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture conditions
The cell lines MSTO-211H, NCI-H28, HCT116 and
HT29 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection; JU77, LO68, NO36, ONE58 and STY51
were gifts from Professor Bruce W. Robinson [37];
GAY2911, OLD1612 and VGE were derived from pleural
fluids or tumors of MMe patients. Cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Serana), 4 mM L-glutamine (Life
Technologies), 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies)
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies) in a
humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.

TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR analysis
(qRT-PCR)
qRT-PCR was performed as described previously
[38]. mRNA expression of genes was quantified using
the following TaqMan gene expression arrays (Applied

1527

Oncotarget

Biosystems): GLI1 (hs01110766_m1), GLI2 (hs01119974_
m1), PTCH1 (hs00181117_m1) and PGK1 (4326318E1006008). The levels of each gene were normalized to PGK1
mRNA and presented as fold change with respect to untreated
cells for each gene.

with 5 μM mitoSOX red mitochondrial superoxide indicator
(Life Technologies) at 37oC for 45 min. Red and green
fluorescence emissions were analyzed by flow cytometry
using excitation/emission wavelengths of 488/530 nm
and 488/585 nm for CH2DCFDA and mitoSOX red,
respectively.

Cell proliferation assay

RNA interference

Cell proliferation was determined using the
methylene blue assay as previously described [39].
Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated
the following day with GANT61 (0.2 – 50 μM) (Tocris
Bioscience) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma
Aldrich) as vehicle control. Following treatment, cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich)
for 10 min at 4°C followed by staining with 2%
methylene blue/0.01M borate (pH 8.5) solution (Sigma
Aldrich). Excess dye was then washed off using 0.01M
borate buffer (pH 8.5) and the methylene blue dye
from cells were extracted with 1:1 (v/v) ethanol and
0.I M hydrochloric acid and quantitated at 650 nm on a
Wallac 1420 VICTOR2 multilabel plate reader (Perkin
Elmer). Half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50)
were determined using Graphpad Prism 4.03 software
(Graphpad Software, Inc.).

Cells were grown to 80% confluence and transfected
with 100 nM GLI1 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
GLI2 siRNA (Sigma Aldrich) or negative control siRNA
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Lipofectamine 2000
transfection reagent (Life Technologies) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Gli luciferase reporter assay
Gli transcriptional activity was measured using a
Cignal Gli Reporter (luc) kit (SABiosciences) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded
in 12-well plates 24 h before transfection. Cells were
cotransfected with 500 ng of Gli luciferase reporter
construct and a Renilla luciferase construct (40:1 ratio)
using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent, with
a 9:1 ratio (v/w) of Lipofectamine 2000 to DNA. Cells
were harvested using the Dual-Glo Luciferase assay
system (Promega) 48 h after transfection according to
the manufacturer’s instruction. Luciferase activity was
measured using a microplate reader. All reporter assays
were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.

Cell cycle analysis by DNA content
Cells were treated with 20 μM GANT61 for 24–72
h then fixed with 70% ethanol at 4°C. Cells were stained
with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma Aldrich) in
the presence of 100 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A (Life
Technologies) for 30 min at room temperature. Stained
cells were analyzed for DNA content using a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and quantified using the
FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).

Western blot analysis
Cells were harvested, lysed using CelLytic M
mammalian cell lysis/extraction reagent (Sigma Aldrich),
and the protein concentrations determined by NanoDrop
2000c Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Proteins
(30 μg) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred
onto nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore), which was then
blocked with 5% nonfat milk or bovine serum albumin
(Sigma Aldrich) in 0.1% Tris-buffered saline-Tween
20 for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were
incubated at 4°C overnight with the indicated primary
antibodies. Antibodies recognizing GLI1, GLI2 and
Bcl-2 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
As a protein loading control, membranes were probed
with a mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). After repeated washing to remove
unbound antibodies, the membranes were further incubated
with horseradish peroxide-conjugated anti-rabbit or antimouse secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology)
for 1 h at room temperature. Chemiluminescent detection
of antibody binding was performed using the Immobilon
Western HRP Substrate (Millipore).

Detection of apoptosis
Detection of apoptotic cells was performed with the
PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection kit (BD Biosciences)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells
were harvested after drug treatment, washed twice with
ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubated
with Annexin V PE conjugate and 7-aminoactinomycin
D (7AAD) for 15 min in the dark. Stained cells were
analyzed by flow cytometry and quantified using the
FlowJo software.

ROS detection
Intracellular ROS production was determined
by loading cells with 20 μM 6-carboxy-2’,7’dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CH2DCFDA) (Life
Technologies) at 37°C for 45 min. Intramitochondrial
superoxide production was determined by loading cells
