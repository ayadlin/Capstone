Abstract
Cigarette smoking at diagnosis or during therapy correlates with poor outcome in patients with lung and
esophageal cancers, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we observed that exposure of
esophageal cancer cells to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) led to upregulation of the xenobiotic pump ABCG2,
which is expressed in cancer stem cells and confers treatment resistance in lung and esophageal carcinomas.
Furthermore, CSC increased the side population of lung cancer cells containing cancer stem cells. Upregulation of
ABCG2 coincided with increased occupancy of aryl hydrocarbon receptor, Sp1, and Nrf2 within the ABCG2
promoter, and deletion of xenobiotic response elements and/or Sp1 sites markedly attenuated ABCG2 induction.
Under conditions potentially achievable in clinical settings, mithramycin diminished basal as well as CSCmediated increases in AhR, Sp1, and Nrf2 levels within the ABCG2 promoter, markedly downregulated ABCG2,
and inhibited proliferation and tumorigenicity of lung and esophageal cancer cells. Microarray analyses revealed
that mithramycin targeted multiple stem cell–related pathways in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our ﬁndings
provide a potential mechanistic link between smoking status and outcome of patients with lung and esophageal
cancers, and support clinical use of mithramycin for repressing ABCG2 and inhibiting stem cell signaling in
thoracic malignancies. Cancer Res; 72(16); 4178–92. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Lung and esophageal cancers are leading causes of cancerrelated deaths worldwide (1). In 2011, these malignancies
accounted for an estimated 1.8 million deaths globally; in
the United States, nearly 160,000 deaths were attributed to
lung cancer, whereas 15,000 deaths were due to esophageal
carcinoma (2). Presently, 80% of lung cancers and 50% of
esophageal carcinomas are directly attributable to cigarette
smoke (3, 4). Currently, more than 1.3 billion people smoke;
hence, the global burden of tobacco-associated thoracic malignancies will continue to increase, with particularly devastating
consequences in developing countries (5).

In addition to being a signiﬁcant risk factor for major
morbidity and mortality in individuals undergoing potentially
curative resections (6, 7), cigarette smoking diminishes
responses to chemo- and radiation therapy, enhances systemic
metastases, and decreases survival of patients with locally
advanced or disseminated lung and esophageal cancers (8–
11); the mechanisms underlying these phenomena have not
been fully established. Previously, we reported that under
clinically relevant exposure conditions, cigarette smoke
enhances tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells via polycombmediated repression of Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), which encodes an
antagonist of Wnt signaling (12). In unpublished studies, we
observed a similar phenomenon in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells following cigarette smoke exposure. In addition, we
have observed that cigarette smoke activates miR-31, targeting
Dkk1 as well as several other Wnt antagonists in lung cancer
cells; constitutive expression of this miRNA signiﬁcantly
enhanced proliferation of lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo
(13). In more recent studies, we observed that cigarette smoke
mediates epigenetic repression of miR-487b in lung cancer
cells, resulting in overexpression of polycomb group proteins
BMI1 and SUZ12, as well as Wnt5a, k-ras, and C-myc, all of
which have been implicated in modulating stem cell pluripotency (14–18); consistent with these observations, knockdown
of miR-487b increases proliferation and tumorigenicity of lung
cancer cells (Xi and colleagues; submitted). This study was
undertaken to examine if cigarette smoke activates additional

Mithramycin and ABCG2

stem cell–associated genes, which enhance the malignant
phenotype of lung and esophageal cancers in an effort to
develop novel pharmacologic strategies for treatment of these
neoplasms.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and treatment conditions
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, all cancer lines were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were validated
by periodic HLA typing of laboratory cultures relative to new
cell aliquots from the repository. NCI-SB-EsC1 and NCI-SBEsC2 (EsC1 and EsC2, respectively) were established in our
laboratory from 2 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma
who developed disease recurrence after undergoing induction chemo/XRT and surgery on Institutional Review Board
approval protocols; these cell lines exhibit HLA as well as
cytokeratin expression proﬁles identical to the respective
primary tumors. All cancer lines were maintained in RPMI
media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (normal media). Primary normal human small
airway epithelial cells (SAEC) were obtained from Lonza,
Inc. and cultured per vendor instructions. Cigarette smoke
condensates (CSC) were generated as described (19). For
smoke exposure experiments, cells were cultured in appropriate normal media with or without varying concentrations
of CSC. Media and CSC were changed daily. Cells were
subcultured as necessary and harvested at appropriate times
for further analysis.
Mithramycin was obtained from either Sigma or the
Developmental Therapeutics Program (National Cancer
Institute). For drug exposure treatments, cells were cultured
in normal media with or without CSC. Media was changed
and mithramycin was added at various concentrations for
24 hours; cells were harvested at indicated time points for
further analysis.
RNA isolation, real-time quantitative reverse
transcription PCR, and microarray analysis
Total RNA was isolated and real-time quantitative reverse
transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was done as described (19),
using primers and probes listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Full details are submitted as Supplementary Methods.
Immunoblotting and immunoﬂuorescence
Submitted as Supplementary Methods.
Generation of stable cells expressing shRNA constructs
A549 and EsC2 cells were transfected with validated short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs targeting ABCG2 or sham
sequences (vector control) according to manufacturer's protocols (Sigma). Stable cells were selected and expanded in
Puromycin (Sigma) after target gene expression was conﬁrmed
by qRT-PCR and immunoﬂuorescence techniques.
Proliferation, cell migration, and soft agar clonogenicity
assays

Murine xenograft experiments
Athymic nude mice were injected in bilateral ﬂanks with
1  106 parental A549 cells. Approximately 10 days later when
palpable tumors were present, mice were randomly assigned to
receive mithramycin at 1 or 2 mg/kg body weight or saline
administered as intraperitoneal injections on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 3 weeks. Tumor dimensions and mouse
weights were measured twice weekly. When control tumors
approached maximum allowable size, all mice were euthanized, and tumors were excised, weighed, and processed for
additional studies. All mouse experiments were approved by
the National Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use Committee
and were in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was
carried out as described (20), with minor modiﬁcations. Full
methods are described in Supplementary Methods. Antibodies
and primers for ChIP are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Luciferase promoter–reporter transient transfection
experiments
Submitted as Supplementary Methods.
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry for ABCG2 surface expression and side
population was carried out as described (21), with minor
modiﬁcations. Full methods submitted as Supplementary
Methods.
Statistical analysis
SEM is indicated by bars on ﬁgures and was calculated using
Microsoft Ofﬁce Excel 2007. All experiments were conducted
with at a minimum of triplicate samples, and all P values were
calculated with 2-tailed t tests.

Results
CSC induces ABCG2 expression in cultured cancer cells
Affymetrix microarrays were used to identify gene expression proﬁles in cultured lung and esophageal cancer cells
mediated by CSC under clinically relevant exposure conditions. ABCG2 [also known as breast cancer resistance
protein (BCRP)], which encodes a xenobiotic pump protein
highly expressed in cancer stem cells (22), was one of the
most highly upregulated genes in Calu-6, A549, EsC1, and
EsC2 cells exposed to CSC (data not shown). Subsequent
qRT-PCR experiments (Fig. 1A, top panel) showed that A549
and EsC2 had relatively high basal expression of ABCG2,
which was increased 2- to 4-fold and approximately 8-fold,
respectively, by CSC treatment. In contrast, Calu-6 cells had
relatively low level basal expression of ABCG2, which was
augmented approximately 25- to 30-fold by CSC. Normal
SAEC exhibited very low basal levels and minimal (3- to 4fold) induction of ABCG2. CSC-mediated induction of
ABCG2 was observed across numerous additional non–
small cell lung cancer lines, but was not observed in a

panel of small cell lung cancer lines, all of which had very
low levels of endogenous ABCG2 expression (Supplementary
Fig. S1). The lack of validated lines precluded further
induction experiments using esophageal cancer cells.
Immunoblot experiments were done to examine ABCG2
levels in cultured cells before and after CSC exposure.
Representative results are depicted in Fig. 1A, bottom left
panel. CSC exposure increased ABCG2 levels in lung and
esophageal cancer cells; this phenomenon was less dramatic
in SAEC. Basal levels of ABCG2 expression in Calu-6 cells and
SAEC were considerably lower than those observed in A549
and EsC2 cells; detection of ABCG2 in Calu-6 and SAEC
required loading 3-fold more protein lysates than needed to
evaluate ABCG2 in A549 and EsC2 cells (200 mg vs. 60 mg,
respectively). Subsequent ﬂow cytometry experiments
revealed that CSC exposure increased surface expression of
ABCG2 in A549, Calu-6, and EsC2 cells (Fig. 1A, bottom right
panel). This phenomenon was not evident in SAEC, possibly
attributable to very low basal levels of ABCG2 expression
and relatively modest upregulation of ABCG2 following CSC
exposure.
Additional qRT-PCR experiments were done to assess
timing and duration of ABCG2 induction in cancer cells
mediated by CSC. Results pertaining to Calu-6 and EsC2
cells are depicted in Fig. 1B. In both cell lines, ABCG2
expression increased signiﬁcantly 8 to 24 hours following
initiation of CSC exposure. In Calu-6 cells, ABCG2 expression continued to increase throughout the 10-day smoke
exposure; in EsC2 cells, ABCG2 expression peaked at 48
hours, plateauing off thereafter. In both cell lines, ABCG2
expression decreased dramatically and approached pretreatment levels within 1 to 3 days following cessation of
CSC exposure.
ABCG2 modulates proliferation, migration, and
clonogenicity of cancer cells
Additional experiments were carried out to ascertain whether ABCG2 expression modulated the malignant phenotype of
cultured lung and esophageal cancer cells. Brieﬂy, lentiviral
shRNA techniques were used to knockdown ABCG2 in A549
and EsC2 cells exhibiting relatively high-level ABCG2 expression. qRT-PCR and immunoprecipitation experiments conﬁrmed signiﬁcant reduction of ABCG2 expression in ABCG2
knockdown cells relative to respective controls (Fig. 1C).
Subsequent experiments showed that knockdown of ABCG2
signiﬁcantly decreased proliferation and migration of A549
lung cancer cells, and to lesser extent, EsC2 cells (Fig. 1D). In
addition, knockdown of ABCG2 signiﬁcantly inhibited soft agar
clonogenicity of A549 cells (Fig. 1D). This phenomenon could

not be assessed in EsC2 cells, which exhibited poor clonogenicity in soft agar.
CSC increases side population of cultured cancer cells
Recent studies have indicated that ABCG2 is highly expressed in cancer stem cells, which are enriched within the
side population identiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry techniques
(21, 23). As such, additional experiments were done to examine
whether CSC increased side population of cancer cells. Representative results pertaining to A549 and Calu-6 cells (high
and low ABCG2 expressers, respectively), as well as SAEC are
depicted in Fig. 2A. Hoechst staining with and without verapamil revealed a side population fraction of 0.23% in untreated
A549 cells, compared with 0.95% (a 4-fold increase) in A549
cells exposed to CSC for 5 days. The side population fraction in
untreated Calu-6 cells (0.06%) was much lower than A549 cells
and increased to 0.98% (a 16-fold increase) following CSC
exposure. In contrast, side population fraction of SAEC did
not seem to be increased following CSC exposure.
Additional experiments were done to examine whether the
increase in side population coincided with enhanced ABCG2
expression in cancer cells exposed to CSC. Brieﬂy, qRT-PCR
techniques were used to quantitate ABCG2 expression in
sorted side population as well as non–side population fractions
from A549 and Calu-6 cells cultured in normal media with or
without CSC. Results of this analysis are depicted in Fig. 2B and
summarized in Supplementary Table S2. In A549 cells, untreated side population fractions had approximately 2.8-fold higher
ABCG2 expression compared with control non–side population. Following CSC treatment, ABCG2 expression in the A549
side population fraction increased approximately 1.6-fold
(range 1.4–2.8) relative to the control side population fraction;
in contrast, CSC treatment did not seem to increase ABCG2
expression in the non–side population fraction from these
cells. The situation was somewhat different for Calu-6 cells. As
anticipated, actual ABCG2 levels in side population and non–
side population fractions in these cells were considerably
lower than those observed for A549. Furthermore, the relative
ABCG2 expression level in the side population fraction from
untreated Calu-6 cells was quite similar to that observed in the
non–side population fractions, possibly because of the very
small side population fraction. Following CSC exposure,
ABCG2 expression in the side population fraction increased
approximately 26-fold, whereas ABCG2 expression in the
non–side population fraction increased approximately 3.3-fold
compared with respective untreated controls. Immunoblot
analysis showed that increased ABCG2 expression coincided
with increased ABCG2 levels in side population fractions of
A549 cells following CSC exposure.

Mithramycin and ABCG2

Role of Aryl hydrocarbon receptor and Sp1 in ABCG2
upregulation by CSC
Puriﬁed carcinogens as well as HDAC inhibitors such as
romidepsin induce ABCG2 expression in cancer cells by aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling (24, 25). As such,
additional experiments were carried out to examine the
mechanisms by which CSC induces ABCG2 expression in
lung and esophageal cancer cells. In preliminary experiments, qRT-PCR techniques were used to evaluate ABCG2
expression in lung cancer cells exposed to CSC or various
AhR agonists for 24 hours. Calu-6 as well as EsC1 cells were
chosen for these experiments, as both lines exhibit very low
levels of endogenous ABCG2 expression and comparable
magnitudes of ABCG2 induction following CSC exposure
(data for EsC1 available on request). The magnitude of
ABCG2 induction mediated by benzopyrene, 3-MC, or TCDD
relative to CSC varied somewhat between the cell lines (Fig.
2C; left panel). The AhR antagonist, resveratrol, previously
shown to inhibit romidepsin-mediated activation of ABCG2
(25), only partially abrogated CSC-mediated induction of
ABCG2 in these cells (Fig. 2C; right panel).
In additional experiments, shRNA techniques were used to
knockdown HDAC6, which is required for activation and
nuclear transport of AhR in response to tobacco carcinogens
(26). qRT-PCR and immunoﬂuorescence experiments conﬁrmed decreased HDAC6 expression in knockdown cells relative to respective controls transduced with sham sequences
(Fig. 2D; top panel). Knockdown of HDAC6 only modestly
diminished CSC-mediated induction of ABCG2 in A549, EsC1,
and EsC2 cells (Fig. 2D; bottom panel); the effects of HDAC6
inhibition could not be assessed in Calu-6 cells because of
toxicity of the shRNA construct in these cells. Collectively,
these ﬁndings suggested that induction of ABCG2 by CSC was
not mediated solely by AhR signaling.
In addition to xenobiotic response elements (XRE) that
are binding sites for AhR, the ABCG2 promoter contains a
number of Speciﬁcity protein 1 (Sp1) sites (24) that could
mediate activation of this gene in response to cigarette smoke.
As such, transient transfection experiments using ABCG2 promoter–reporter constructs were carried out to examine potential roles of AhR and Sp1 in mediating ABCG2 activation by CSC.
Representative results of these experiments are depicted in Fig.
3A. Following CSC exposure, luciferase activity of ABCG2-1662
containing 4 XRE sites was 4-fold higher than pGL3 Basic Luc
control in Calu-6 cells. CSC mediated luciferase activity of
ABCG2-1662 del 198, in which one of the XRE sites had been
deleted, was 50% lower than that observed for ABCG2-1662.
CSC-mediated luciferase activity was also diminished following
transfection with ABCG2-245 containing 2 XRE sites and 5 Sp1

elements present in ABCG2-1662. Mutation of the 5 Sp1 sites
signiﬁcantly diminished luciferase activity of ABCG2-245 to a
level less than that seen for ABCG2 del 198 luc. CSC mediated
luciferase activities of ABCG2-245 following deletion of one of
the remaining XRE (ABCG2-XRE del 245 luc) or combined
deletion of this XRE with mutation of the 5 Sp1 sites
(ABCG2-Sp1 mut-XRE del 198 luc) were further decreased,
approximating those seen for PGL3 basic luc. These data
suggested that in addition to AhR, Sp1 contributes signiﬁcantly
to CSC-mediated activation of ABCG2 in cancer cells.
Effects of mithramycin on CSC-mediated induction of
ABCG2
Additional studies were carried out to examine whether
mithramycin, a pharmacologic agent that inhibits Sp1-mediated
activation of a variety of genes, including DHFR and AhR (27, 28),
could repress ABCG2 expression in cancer cells. Brieﬂy, cancer
cells were cultured in normal media with or without CSC in the
presence or absence of escalating doses of mithramycin. qRTPCR analysis revealed that 24 hours of treatment with mithramycin decreased basal levels of ABCG2 and markedly attenuated
CSC-mediated induction of ABCG2 in lung and esophageal
cancer cells (Fig. 3B). Downregulation of these genes persisted
for at least 16 hours following removal of mithramycin from
culture media (data not shown). Additional analysis revealed
that mithramycin inhibited basal levels as well as CSC-mediated
upregulation of Sp1 and AhR in these cells. Furthermore, mithramycin decreased basal as well as CSC-mediated expression of
nuclear factor erythroid related factor 2 (Nrf2), which has been
shown recently to modulate ABCG2 expression (29). Immunoblot experiments showed that mithramycin mediated dosedependent decreases in ABCG2, Sp1, AhR, and Nrf2 expression
and partially abrogated CSC-mediated increases in levels of
these transcription factors in A549 and Calu-6 cells (Fig. 3C).
ChIP experiments were done to examine whether mithramycin modulates basal as well as CSC-mediated levels of
Sp1, AhR, and Nrf2 within the ABCG2 promoter. ChIP
primers encompassed a region containing AhR and Sp1
recognition elements adjacent to the transcription start site;
additional ChIP primers ampliﬁed a region containing the
Nrf2 antioxidant response element within the ABCG2 promoter (29). Results pertaining to Calu-6 cells (simultaneously processed for qRT-PCR experiments in Fig. 3B) are
depicted in Fig. 3D. CSC-mediated activation of ABCG2
coincided with increased levels of RNA polymerase II (pol
II) and H3K9Ac, with decreased levels of H3K9Me3 (activation and repression marks, respectively) within the ABCG2
promoter. CSC induced recruitment of Sp1, AhR, and Nrf2 to
the ABCG2 promoter; these results were most dramatic for

are shown in Fig. 4. MTS experiments showed that 24 hours
of mithramycin exposure mediated profound growth-inhibitory effects in cultured lung and esophageal cancer cells
(Fig. 4A). Apo-BrdUrd experiments revealed no appreciable
increase in apoptosis in mithramycin-treated cells, suggesting that the growth-inhibitory effects of this agent were
mediated by cell-cycle arrest rather than apoptosis (data not
shown). Additional ﬂow cytometry experiments using A549
cells suggested that mithramycin decreased side population
fraction (Fig. 4B).
Further experiments were carried out to examine if mithramycin diminished growth of established tumor xenografts. As
shown in Fig. 4C, mithramycin mediated signiﬁcant dosedependent growth inhibition of A549 xenografts without
appreciable systemic toxicities, such as decreased activity,
skin changes, or signiﬁcant weight loss. Histopathologic analysis revealed that tumors from mithramycin-treated mice were
less glandular in appearance with somewhat less stroma.
Furthermore, tumors from mice treated with 2 mg/kg mithramycin had 50% fewer mitoses relative to control tumors (data
not shown). Immunoﬂuorescence experiments conﬁrmed that
mithramycin decreased ABCG2 expression in tumor xenografts (Fig. 4D).
Because Sp1 has diverse potential targets (30), Affymetrix
microarray experiments were conducted to examine global
gene expression proﬁles in Calu-6 and A549 cultured in normal
media, with or without mithramycin for 24 hours. Under
conditions potentially achievable in clinical settings (50–200
nmol/L  24 hours), mithramycin mediated dramatic dosedependent alterations in gene expression in cultured lung
cancer cells. Highly reproducible results were noted among
cell lines and within treatment groups (Fig. 5A, top left panel).
Using stringent criteria of fold change greater than 3 and
adjusted P less than 0.01 for drug treatment versus control,
1,582 and 3,771 genes were simultaneously modulated in A549
and Calu-6 cells following 50 and 200 nmol/L mithramycin
exposures, respectively (Fig. 5A; bottom left panel). A total of
1,258 genes were commonly regulated by mithramycin across 2
cell lines and 2 drug concentrations; the majority of differentially regulated genes were downregulated in both cell lines
(Fig. 5A right panel; Supplementary Fig. S2). Sixteen of the top
cancer-associated pathways, which were downregulated in
cultured lung cancer cells by mithramycin are listed

in Table 1A; 8 of these canonical pathways are related to stem
cell signaling.
Additional microarray experiments were carried out to
examine effects of mithramycin in A549 xenografts (9 each
from drug-treated or control mice). Similar to what was
observed following in vitro drug treatment, mithramycin mediated highly reproducible, dose-dependent alterations in gene
expression in A549 tumor xenografts (Fig. 5B; left and top right
panel). Using criteria of fold change greater than 2 and P less
than 0.05 for drug treatment versus control, 351 and 1,896
genes were differentially expressed in xenografts from mice
receiving mithramycin at 1 and 2 mg/kg, respectively, relative
to control tumors (Fig. 5B; bottom right panel). A total of 299
genes were modulated by mithramycin under both doses, 100
of which are listed in Table 2. ABCG2 was downregulated by
more than 2-fold in xenografts from mice receiving 2 mg/kg but
not 1 mg/kg mithramycin. All 8 of the stem cell–related
pathways modulated in vitro by mithramycin were also targeted in tumor xenografts by systemic drug treatment, albeit to
a somewhat lesser degree (Table 1B). A similar phenomenon
was observed regarding the remaining 8 canonical pathways
listed in Table 1A. A variety of networks regulating intracelleular signaling, DNA damage response, chromatin remodeling, and chromosomal replication were inhibited in A549
tumor xenografts following mithramycin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Further analysis was undertaken to correlate in vivo effects
of mithramycin with in vitro drug exposures. A progressive
dose-dependent increase in genes commonly regulated in vitro
and in vivo by mithramycin was observed (Fig. 5C). Two to 10%
(average 5%) of genes modulated in vitro overlapped with 13%
to 24% (average 18%) of genes altered by in vivo mithramycin
across various treatment comparisons. A total of 337 genes
were simultaneously modulated in cultured A549 and Calu-6
cells following 200 nmol/L mithramycin and A549 xenografts
from mice receiving 2 mg/kg mithramycin i.p.. The top 100
repressed and all 43 upregulated genes from these 337 commonly regulated genes are listed in Supplementary Table S3.
Top molecular and cellular functions mediated by these 337
genes included cell-cycle progression, gene expression, stem
cell pluripotency, cellular morphology, and death. Representative networks mediating chromatin remodeling and TGFb/BMP-3 signaling are depicted in Supplementary Fig. S4.

Discussion
The vast majority of lung and esophageal carcinomas are
directly attributable to tobacco abuse (3, 4). Cigarette smoking
not only facilitates initiation and preclinical progression of
lung and esophageal cancers but also enhances treatment
resistance and dissemination of established malignancies,
thereby decreasing overall survival of patients with these
neoplasms (8, 10, 11, 31). Delineation of the mechanisms by
which cigarette smoke promotes proliferation of lung and
esophageal carcinomas may facilitate development of more
efﬁcacious treatment regimens for these malignancies.
Our previous studies have shown that cigarette smoke
increases the malignant phenotype of lung and esophageal
cancer cells, in part, by upregulating genes, which mediate
stem cell phenotype (12, 13). Consistent with these observations, our current experiments revealed that cigarette smoke
mediates time- and dose-dependent upregulation of ABCG2 in
lung and esophageal cancer cells; this phenomenon seemed to
be considerably less pronounced in cultured normal aerodigestive tract epithelia. As expected, CSC-mediated upregulation of ABCG2 in cancer cells coincided with increased side
population fraction; these ﬁndings suggest, although certainly
do not prove, that cigarette smoke promotes expansion of
pluripotent tumor cells (21). Further analysis revealed that
CSC-mediated activation of ABCG2 coincided with recruitment of AhR and Nrf2, as well as Sp1 to the ABCG2 promoter.
Mithramycin repressed basal as well as CSC-mediated induction of ABCG2; these effects may be attributable to direct
inhibition of binding of Sp1 to DNA (27) and decreased
expression of Sp1, as well as AhR and Nrf2 (2 potential targets
of Sp1; ref. 28), which are known to activate ABCG2. In addition,
mithramycin dramatically decreased proliferation and tumorigenicity of cancer cells. Growth inhibition coincided with
downregulation of ABCG2, as well as numerous other genes
mediating "stemness," proliferation, and metastatic potential
of cancer cells. To the best of our knowledge, these experiments
represent the most comprehensive analysis of mechanisms
regulating ABCG2 expression in thoracic malignancies following exposure to cigarette smoke and are the ﬁrst to show the
potential of mithramycin for targeting ABCG2 as well as other
stem cell–related genes in thoracic malignancies.
ABCG2 (BCRP) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters, which functions as a xenobiotic pump in
many normal tissues (32). Its substrates include numerous
environmental toxins as well as chemotherapeutic agents. Our
experiments showed that knockdown of ABCG2 inhibits proliferation, migration, and clonogenicity of lung and esophageal
cancer cells; these ﬁndings suggest that ABCG2 modulates
intracellular processes other than extrusion of xenobiotics.
Several recent studies suggest that ABCG2 is a critical mediator
of stem cell homeostasis. For example, ABCG2 is an essential
upstream mediator of sonic-hedgehog signaling, which has
been implicated in maintenance of stemness (33). Furthermore, ABCG2 binds to heme, thereby diminishing intracellular
porphyrin levels, rendering stem cells resistant to hypoxia (34).
Constitutive expression of ABCG2 protects cardiac stem cells
from oxidative stress (35) and enhances expansion, although

4190

Cancer Res; 72(16) August 15, 2012

impairing maturation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (36).
Of particular relevance regarding our current study are recent
reports showing that increased expression of ABCG2 correlates
with chemoresistance and stem-like phenotype of lung and
esophageal carcinomas (21, 23, 37–39) and decreased survival
of patients with these neoplasms (40–42).
Despite the fact that knockdown of ABCG2 decreased proliferation, migration, and clonogenicity of lung and esophageal
cancer cells, our current data do not establish nor imply that
downregulation of ABCG2 is the primary mechanism by which
mithramycin inhibits proliferation and tumorigenicity of these
cancer cells. Indeed, our microarray analysis revealed that
mithramycin signiﬁcantly downregulated hundreds of genes
mediating stem cell signaling, cell-cycle progression, chromatin remodeling, and DNA damage response. Although experiments are underway to examine this issue, it seems unlikely
that constitutive overexpression of ABCG2 would signiﬁcantly
diminish mithramycin-mediated cytotoxicity in cultured cancer cells, unless this agent is a substrate for ABCG2. In all
likelihood, the antitumor effects of mithramycin are mediated
by direct inhibition of Sp1 binding to promoters of master
genes regulating diverse cellular functions, with subsequent
repression of downstream targets by direct as well as indirect
mechanisms (30, 43).
Mithramycin, a polyauroleic acid isolated from streptomyces, was initially evaluated as a chemotherapeutic agent
in cancer patients during the 1960s and 70s (44), but was
discontinued because of excessive systemic toxicities (45).
Recently there has been renewed interest in clinical development of mithramycin and its derivatives because of their
ability to speciﬁcally inhibit binding of Sp1 to GC-rich DNA
(27) and downregulate numerous genes mediating proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells (46–48). Of
particular interest in this regard are recent studies indicating that currently approved agents such as cyclo-oxygenase
inhibitors markedly enhance mithramycin-mediated inhibition of Sp1 expression/activity in cancer cells (49). Such
combinational strategies could enable reduction of mithramycin doses and, possibly, decrease systemic toxicities in
clinical settings.
Our current ﬁndings have direct translational implications
with regard to evaluation of mithramycin in patients with
thoracic malignancies. Extrapolation of data from previous
animal studies (50) suggests that mithramycin levels achieved
in our xenograft experiments were in the 50 to 200 nmol/L
range over 24 hours; these exposure conditions, which closely
approximated those used for our in vitro experiments, are
potentially achievable using previous mithramycin dosing
schedules in humans (44). Collectively, our ﬁndings support
the clinical evaluation of mithramycin as a strategy to repress
ABCG2 and inhibit signaling pathways mediating "stemness" in
thoracic malignancies.
