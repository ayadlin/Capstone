Abstract
Active-site mTOR inhibitors (asTORi) hold great promise for targeting dysregulated mTOR signaling in cancer.
Because of the multifaceted nature of mTORC1 signaling, identiﬁcation of reliable biomarkers for the sensitivity
of tumors to asTORi is imperative for their clinical implementation. Here, we show that cancer cells acquire
resistance to asTORi by downregulating eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF4E)-binding proteins
(4E-BPs—EIF4EBP1, EIF4EBP2). Loss of 4E-BPs or overexpression of eIF4E renders neoplastic growth and
translation of tumor-promoting mRNAs refractory to mTOR inhibition. Conversely, moderate depletion of eIF4E
augments the anti-neoplastic effects of asTORi. The anti-proliferative effect of asTORi in vitro and in vivo is
therefore signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by perturbations in eIF4E/4E-BP stoichiometry, whereby an increase in the
eIF4E/4E-BP ratio dramatically limits the sensitivity of cancer cells to asTORi. We propose that the eIF4E/4E-BP
ratio, rather than their individual protein levels or solely their phosphorylation status, should be considered as
a paramount predictive marker for forecasting the clinical therapeutic response to mTOR inhibitors. Cancer Res;

Introduction
mTOR is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase, which
exists in 2 distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 and 2
(mTORC1 and 2; ref. 1). mTORC1 governs many cellular
processes including mRNA translation, cell growth, and
proliferation, by phosphorylating downstream targets such as
4E-BPs and S6Ks (1). mTORC2 controls cell survival and
cytoskeleton organization by modulating the activity of AGC
kinases (e.g., Akt and SGK1) and regulates nascent polypeptide
stability (2). Hyperactivation of mTOR signaling frequently

occurs in cancer (in more than 70% of patients; ref. 3). Therefore, targeting mTOR represents one of the most attractive
anti-cancer therapeutic strategies. Rapamycin, a naturally
occurring allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1, and its analogues
(rapalogs), are clinically approved for treatment of renal cell
carcinomas, mantle cell lymphomas, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (4, 5). Nonetheless, the overall success of
rapalog monotherapies is limited. This has been attributed to
the incomplete inhibition of mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of 4E-BPs, and the activation of Akt via the loss of a
negative feedback mechanism (4, 6, 7). Recently, asTORi (also
referred to as TORKin or dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors)
were developed to overcome these issues. asTORi abolish
phosphorylation of 4E-BPs via the inhibition of mTORC1,
suppress Akt signaling via the inhibition of mTORC2, and
exhibit stronger anti-proliferative and anti-tumorigenic effects
than rapamycin (8–11). However, mTOR regulates various
cancer-related processes via a multitude of substrates, and
this complexity of mTOR signaling represents a signiﬁcant
challenge for identifying surrogate biomarkers that could serve
to predict the efﬁcacy of asTORi in the clinic (12).
eIF4E is the 50 mRNA cap-binding subunit of the eIF4F
complex, which recruits mRNA to the ribosome. eIF4F also
includes the large scaffolding protein eIF4G and the DEAD-box
RNA helicase eIF4A (13, 14). 4E-BPs (in mammals 4E-BP1, 2,
and 3) are small-molecular-weight translational repressors,
which impair the assembly of the eIF4F complex by competing
with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E (14, 15). mTORC1 phosphorylates 4E-BPs leading to their dissociation from eIF4E, thus
increasing the amount of eIF4E available to engage in the eIF4F
complex assembly (15–17). Ectopic expression of eIF4E leads

to transformation of immortalized rodent and human cells (18,
19) and is tumorigenic in vivo (20). About 30% of cancers
exhibit elevated eIF4E levels, which correlate with poor prognosis (21). eIF4E overexpression induces cell transformation by
selectively augmenting translation of mRNAs referred to as
eIF4E-sensitive mRNAs, which encode proliferation- and
survival-promoting proteins (e.g., cyclins, c-myc, and Bcl-xL;
refs. 18, 22). Multiple factors can induce the overexpression of
eIF4E in cancer cells including gene ampliﬁcation (23), transcriptional upregulation by c-myc (24), and increase in eIF4E
mRNA stability by HuR (25). Dysregulated expression and/or
increased phosphorylation of 4E-BPs in cancer have also been
linked to poor patient outcomes (21, 26). 4E-BPs mediate the
effects of mTOR signaling on translation of mRNAs that
encode proteins that are associated with cancer progression,
invasion, and metastasis (e.g., Y-box protein 1, vimentin, and
CD44; ref. 11). 4E-BP1 expression is controlled at the transcriptional and protein stability levels by ATF4 (27) and the
KLHL25-CUL3 complex (28), respectively.
In this study, we show that cancer cells acquire resistance to
asTORi by increasing eIF4E availability via downregulation of
4E-BP1 and 2. Accordingly, we show that an increase in eIF4E,
or reduction in 4E-BP levels by RNA interference, strongly
attenuates the anti-neoplastic effects of the asTORi PP242,
Torin1, and INK1341 (an analogue of the recently characterized
INK128 compound; ref. 11). Conversely, a decrease in the
eIF4E/4E-BP ratio ameliorates the inhibitory effects of asTORi
on translation of eIF4E-sensitive cyclin D3 and E1 mRNAs.
Thus, the eIF4E/4E-BP ratio in the tumor could be a signiﬁcant
predictive marker of the efﬁcacy of asTORi that should be
considered in devising personalized asTORi treatments.

presence of 5 mg/mL polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). Infection was
repeated the next day. Twenty-four hours after the second
infection, medium supplemented with puromycin (1 mg/mL,
Sigma-Aldrich) was added, and cells were subjected to
selection for 1 week, after which time colonies were pooled.
pcDNA3-FLAG-eIF4EWT and eIF4EW56A (cap-binding mutant)
were constructed by cloning the entire coding sequence of
mouse eIF4E into pcDNA3-FLAG using a PCR (32). These
vectors were transfected and cells selected in G418 for 2 weeks.
Lentiviral vectors were from Sigma. Short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) vector accession numbers are: mouse eIF4E (Sigma:
TRCN0000077474), the Non-Target shRNA Control (Sigma:
SHC002). shRNA vectors were co-transfected into HEK293T
cells with the lentivirus packaging plasmids PLP1, PLP2, and
PLP-VSVG (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Supernatants were collected 48 and 72 hours posttransfection,
passed through a 0.45-mm nitrocellulose ﬁlter, and applied
on target cells with polybrene (5 mg/mL). Cells were re-infected
the next day and selected with puromycin for 48 hours
(1 mg/mL, Sigma). PP242 and INK1341 were provided by
Intellikine. Torin1 was from N. Gray and D. Sabatini.

Materials and Methods

Cell-cycle analysis and apoptosis
Cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes, grown overnight, and
treated as indicated in ﬁgure legends. Twenty-four or 48 hours
later, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with
PBS containing 2% FBS and once in PBS. For cell-cycle analysis,
cells were resuspended in 200 mL of NPE Nuclear Isolation
Media (NIM)-DAPI (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed using a
Cell Lab Quanta SC (Beckman Coulter) ﬂow cytometer. For
apoptosis, cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry using the
Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit according to the
manufacturer's protocol (Bio Vision).

Cell culture, constructs, viral infections, and lentiviral
shRNA silencing
E1A/Ras-transformed WT (p53/) and 4E-BP1/2 DKO
(p53/) mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF), referred to as
WTE1A/Ras and 4E-BP1/2 DKOE1A/Ras MEFs respectively, were
previously described (7). HeLa, SK-HEP-1, and HepG2 cells
were directly purchased from and authenticated by American
Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), supplemented
with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 100
units/mL penicillin/streptomycin (all from Invitrogen) at 37 C
and 5% CO2. To induce acquired resistance to asTORi,
WTE1A/Ras, HepG2 and SK-HEP-1 cell lines were cultured in
the continuous presence of the PP242 (1 mmol/L for 8 weeks).
NIH3T3 cells transduced with pMV7-eIF4E or empty vector
(pMV7) were described previously (18). For overexpression
studies, pcDNA3-3HA-4E-BP1 (4E-BP1WT) and pACTAG23HA-4E-BP1 (4E-BP1D4E) have been described previously (29,
30). 4E-BP1 and mutant cDNA were ampliﬁed by PCR and
inserted into BamHI/SalI sites of the retroviral vector pBABE.
Cell lines that stably express 4E-BP1 were generated as
described previously (31). Brieﬂy, pBABE constructs were
transiently transfected into the Ecotropic Phoenix-293T packaging cell line. After 48 hours, virus-containing medium was
ﬁltered (0.45 mm), collected, and used to infect MEFs in the

Cell proliferation, soft agar, and anchorage-dependent
foci formation assay
For the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay
(Cell Proliferation ELISA BrdU Kit from Roche), cells were
seeded in 96-well plates (1,000 cells/well) and maintained as
indicated in the ﬁgure legends. Absorbance at 370 nm (reference wavelength ¼ 492 nm) was measured using a Varioskan
microplate reader (Thermo Electron Corporation). For Trypan
blue exclusion, cells were seeded in 6-well plates (50,000 cells/
well) overnight and maintained under conditions outlined in
the ﬁgure legends. Cell proliferation was determined by direct
counting (dead cells were excluded by Trypan blue staining).
For soft agar assays, experiments were carried out in 6-well
plates coated with a base layer of 0.5% agarose (Agar Noble,
Difco). WTE1A/Ras and 4E-BP1/2 DKOE1A/Ras MEFs were seeded
in triplicates at a density of 5,000 cells/well in 0.35% agarose
containing either vehicle [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)], PP242
(1 mmol/L), or INK1341 (250 nmol/L). Cells were overlaid with
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
and 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) containing either DMSO, PP242 (1 mmol/L), or INK1341 (nmol/L),
and incubated for up to 10 to 14 days. Media containing vehicle,
PP242, or INK1341 were changed every 3 to 4 days during the
course of the experiment. Colonies were counted using a light

microscope. For focus formation assays, cells were seeded at a
density of 10,000 cells/10-cm dish and allowed to grow in the
presence of either vehicle (DMSO) or PP242 (1 mmol/L) or
INK1341 (250 nmol/L). Media containing drugs were changed
as above every 3 to 4 days.
Western blot analysis and cap (m7GDP) pull-down assay
Cell lysates were prepared, and Western blotting was carried
out as described (33). Antibodies against 4E-BP1, 4E-BP2,
phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46, Ser65, Thr70), rpS6, phospho-rpS6
(Ser240/244), Akt, phospho-Akt (S473), eIF4G1, and cyclin D3
were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Antibody
against cyclin E1 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against eIF4E and b-actin were from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and antimouse IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. For cap-binding
afﬁnity assay, cells were lysed in the lysis buffer [50 mmol/L
HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L KCL, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
2 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.2% Tween] containing
protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were incubated with m7GDPagarose and washed 4 times using the lysis buffer. m7GDPbound proteins were determined by Western blotting.
Polysome analysis, RNA isolation, and sqRT-PCR
Polysome proﬁle analysis was carried out as previously
described (34). Brieﬂy, cells were cultured in 15-cm dishes and
treated with PP242 (1 mmol/L), INK1341 (250 nmol/L), or
vehicle (DMSO) for 8 hours. Cells were washed with cold PBS
containing 100 mg/mL cycloheximide, collected, and lysed in a
hypotonic lysis buffer [5 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mmol/L
MgCl2, 1.5 mmol/L KCl, 100 mg/mL cycloheximide, 2 mmol/L
DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate).
Lysates were loaded onto 10% to 50% sucrose density gradients
[20 mmol/L HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 100 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L
MgCl2] and centrifuged at 36,000 rpm for 2 hours at 4 C.
Gradients were fractionated, and the optical density (OD) at
254 nm was continuously recorded using an ISCO fractionator
(Teledyne ISCO). RNA from each fraction was isolated using
TRIzol (Invitrogen) and treated with DNaseTurbo (Ambion)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
reactions were carried out using SuperScript III First-Strand
Synthesis System (Invitrogen) and iQ SYBR Green Supermix
(BIO-RAD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
list of primers and the number of cycles used for each of the
transcripts were described (7).
Tumor growth curves
Six- to 8-week-old NudeNCR (nu/nu) mice were obtained
from Taconic. The animals were maintained under speciﬁc
pathogen-free conditions and treated according to a protocol
approved by the McGill University Animal Care Committee
(Montreal, QC, Canada). A total of 5  106 WTE1A/Ras and 4EBP1/2 DKOE1A/Ras MEFs in 100 mL PBS were injected in the
hind ﬂank of the mice and allowed to grow until palpable tumors were established. For drug treatment, PP242 at 60 mg/kg
in a solution containing 40% PEG-400, 40% PBS, and 20%
DMSO was administrated intraperitoneally in 100 mL volume.
Two-dimensional tumor measurements were conducted with

Results
Acquired resistance to asTORi coincides with
downregulation of 4E-BP1 and 2 expression
To investigate the potential mechanism of acquired resistance to asTORi in cancer cells, we cultivated E1A/Ras-transformed p53/ MEFs (WTE1A/Ras) and 2 liver cancer cell lines
(HepG2 and SK-HEP-1) in the presence of the asTORi PP242 (1
mmol/L for 8 weeks). Strikingly, all 3 cell lines acquired resistance to PP242, which correlated with a downregulation of 4EBP1 and 2 (Figs. 1A–C; Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1F), but not
with a loss of mTORC1 or 2 inhibition, inasmuch as asTORi
induced similar suppression of ribosomal protein S6 (S6) and
Akt phosphorylation in resistant and control cells (Supplementary Fig. S1G and S1H).
To ascertain that 4E-BPs are responsible for the anti-neoplastic activity of asTORi, we investigated the effects of PP242
on the neoplastic growth of WTE1A/Ras and E1A/Ras-transformed p53//4e-bp1/2/ MEFs (4E-BP DKOE1A/Ras). 4E-BP
DKOE1A/Ras MEFs are devoid of all 4E-BPs, as MEFs do not
express 4E-BP3 (7). WTE1A/Ras and 4E-BP DKOE1A/Ras MEFs
proliferated at the same rate in full growth medium (Fig. 1D)
where mTOR activity is high and 4E-BP1 and S6 are hyperphosphorylated (Fig. 1E). However, while PP242 inhibits mTORC1
signaling to a similar extent in these cells, as illustrated by a
comparable reduction in the phosphorylation of S6 (Fig. 1E),
the effects of PP242 on neoplastic growth were signiﬁcantly
less pronounced in 4E-BP DKOE1A/Ras MEFs (45% reduction
in number of colonies and foci relative to control) than in
WTE1A/Ras MEFs (70%; Figs. 1F and G; Supplementary Fig.
S2A–S2C). Moreover, depletion of 4E-BP1 and 2 rendered
neoplastic growth of SK-HEP-1 and HepG2 cells partially
resistant to PP242 (Supplementary Figs. S1A–S1C and S2D–
S2F). These results show that loss of 4E-BPs attenuates the
anti-neoplastic efﬁcacy of asTORi.
Increased eIF4E availability renders cells resistant to
asTORi
When mTOR signaling is inhibited, 4E-BPs limit the fraction
of eIF4E available for the assembly of the eIF4F complex (15–17).
Thus, we investigated whether the sequestration of eIF4E by 4EBPs is required for the anti-neoplastic activity of INK1341 by
overexpressing 4E-BP1WT and 4E-BP1D4E mutant, which lacks
the eIF4E-binding motif and thus cannot bind eIF4E (ref. 35; Fig.
1H). Expression of 4E-BP1WT, but not 4E-BP1D4E, augmented the
anti-neoplastic effect of INK1341 (Figs. 1I and J). Moreover,
forced expression of 4E-BP1WT markedly reduced the association between eIF4E and eIF4G1 as compared with a control
(Supplementary Fig. S2G and S2H). Taken together, these results
show that 4E-BPs mediate the anti-tumorigenic activity of
asTORi by limiting the availability of eIF4E to associate with
eIF4G1, thereby impeding the eIF4F complex assembly.

To further establish that the alterations in eIF4E availability
determine the anti-neoplastic effects of asTORi, we depleted
eIF4E in WTE1A/Ras MEFs and compared the anti-neoplastic
effects of PP242 with those observed in control cells. As
signiﬁcant eIF4E downregulation inhibits proliferation and
survival (36), we selected cells in which eIF4E depletion
(50% of control) does not affect cell proliferation under
optimal nutrient conditions wherein mTOR is active (Fig.
2A and B). Nonetheless, an approximate 50% decrease in eIF4E
levels strongly augmented the sensitivity of WTE1A/Ras MEFs to
PP242 (85% reduction in colony and foci formation), as
compared with control (65%; Figs. 2C and D; Supplementary
Fig. S3D–S3F). Similar results were obtained using INK1341
(Figs. 2E–G; Supplementary Fig. S3G and S3H). Suppression of
neoplastic growth by asTORi was caused by the inhibition of
cell-cycle progression from G1 to S-phase, whereas asTORi did

not exert a major effect on cell survival (Supplementary Fig.
S4A–S4C). Importantly, the asTORi-induced inhibition of G1–S
progression was alleviated in cells with high eIF4E/4E-BP ratio
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). These results support a model
whereby asTORi suppress neoplastic growth by limiting eIF4E
availability and cell-cycle progression.
Persistent translation of eIF4E-sensitive mRNAs
renders cells refractory to asTORi
The eIF4E/4E-BP ratio dictates cap-dependent mRNA translation rates (15). Thus, we investigated whether translational
activity of eIF4E is required for attenuation of the anti-neoplastic effects of asTORi, by overexpressing wild-type
(eIF4EWT) and a translationally inactive W56A eIF4E mutant
(eIF4EW56A; refs. 37, 38) in WTE1A/Ras MEFs. Both proteins were
expressed to a comparable level (Fig. 2H). Cells overexpressing

eIF4EWT exhibited signiﬁcantly lower sensitivity (50% inhibition of proliferation) to the anti-neoplastic and anti-proliferative effects of PP242 than control cells (70%), whereas
suppression of proliferation and neoplastic growth by PP242 in
cells overexpressing eIF4EW56A was similar to that observed in
control cells (Figs. 2I and J; Supplementary Fig. S4D and S4E).
Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4F–S4H).
Next, we examined the effect of PP242 and INK1341 on
global mRNA translation in WTE1A/Ras and 4E-BP DKOE1A/Ras
MEFs, as well as in WTE1A/Ras MEFs depleted of eIF4E, by
studying polysome formation. The fraction of ribosomes
engaged in polysomes is directly proportional to the translation initiation rate (39). Consistent with previous reports that
PP242 suppresses initiation of cap-dependent mRNA translation (8), a decrease in the number of ribosomes engaged in
polysomes, and a concomitant increase in 80S monosome peak
was detected in all cells treated with PP242 as compared with
control (Fig. 3A). However, inhibition of polysome formation by
PP242 was most pronounced in WTE1A/Ras MEFs in which
eIF4E was depleted, intermediate in control WTE1A/Ras MEFs,

and weakest in 4E-BP DKOE1A/Ras MEFs (Fig. 3A). Similar
results were obtained using INK1341 (Fig. 3B).
While our data show that an elevated eIF4E/4E-BP ratio
mitigates the inhibition of global mRNA translation by PP242
or INK1341, the lack of a complete dissociation of polysomes
indicates that the majority of mRNAs remain translationally
active in asTORi-treated cells. This suggests that the resistance
to asTORi is caused by the resistance of eIF4E-sensitive
mRNAs to inhibition in cancer cells with elevated eIF4E/4EBP ratio (21, 40). Thus, we investigated the effects of PP242 and
INK1341 on translation of the prototypical eIF4E-sensitive
mRNAs cyclin D3, and cyclin E1, as well as ß-actin mRNA,
which is only marginally sensitive to changes in eIF4E (7, 22). In
vehicle-treated cells, in which the sequestration of eIF4E by 4EBPs is minimal due to the hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BPs, loss
of 4E-BPs or approximately 50% depletion of eIF4E had no
major impact on translation of eIF4E-senstive mRNAs (Figs.
3C–E). PP242 and INK1341 abolished the phosphorylation of
4E-BPs (Figs. 1E, 2B, and 3E) and strongly suppressed translation of the eIF4E-sensitive mRNAs cyclin D3 and E1, as
well as the expression of corresponding proteins in control

eIF4E/4E-BP Ratio Determines Efﬁcacy of mTOR Inhibitors

WTE1A/Ras MEFs, which was further potentiated by the depletion of eIF4E (Figs. 3C–E). In stark contrast, translation of
cyclin D3 and E1 mRNAs and expression of cyclin D3 and
E1 proteins in 4E-BP DKOE1A/Ras MEFs were largely insensitive
to PP242 and INK1341 (Figs. 3C–E). As expected, the translation of b-actin mRNA or expression of b-actin protein were
not inﬂuenced by asTORi treatment in any of the cell lines
(Figs. 3C–E). Finally, Torin1 strongly reduced cyclin D3 expression in control NIH3T3 cells, but not in NIH3T3 cells overexpressing eIF4E (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Collectively,
these results show that the resistance to the anti-neoplastic
effects of asTORi of cancer cells with high eIF4E/4E-BP ratio
stems from the failure of asTORi to efﬁciently inhibit translation of eIF4E-sensitive mRNAs.
eIF4E/4E-BP ratio determines sensitivity to asTORi in
vivo
Next, we studied the impact of perturbations in the eIF4E/
4E-BP ratio on the anti-neoplastic activity of asTORi in vivo.
Mice bearing subcutaneous tumors formed by WTE1A/Ras or 4EBP DKOE1A/Ras MEFs were treated daily with PP242 or a vehicle.
Remarkably, whereas PP242 inhibited the growth of tumors
formed by WTE1A/Ras MEFs, tumors lacking 4E-BPs were
completely resistant to PP242. Moreover, depletion of eIF4E in
WTE1A/Ras tumors further increased their sensitivity to PP242
(Figs. 4A–E). PP242 strongly inhibited mTOR signaling in vivo,
as illustrated by inhibition of S6 phosphorylation 30 minutes
and 24 hours postinjection from tumor tissues (Fig. 4F). Thus,
consistent with the in vitro ﬁndings, the anti-neoplastic activity
of asTORi in vivo is predominantly established by the eIF4E/4EBP ratio in the tumor.

Discussion
mTOR signaling is frequently dysregulated in cancer and is
being targeted in clinical trials using asTORi (1, 41). However,
there are currently no reliable markers that can predict the
therapeutic efﬁcacy of asTORi. Recently, several models have
been proposed to explain resistance to asTORi as well as dual
PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitors in tumors. These include activation of alternative signaling pathways, such as the extracellular signal–regulated kinase pathway that can render 4E-BP1
persistently inactive despite treatment with mTOR inhibitors
(42), or pathways that activate cap-independent translation of
survival-promoting mRNAs (43). We have unraveled a different
mechanism to explain the acquired resistance to mTOR inhibitors, whereby cancer cells become insensitive to asTORi by
downregulating expression of 4E-BP1 and 2. This leads to an
increase in the eIF4E/4E-BP ratio, thereby attenuating the anti-

neoplastic effects of asTORi as it limits their inhibitory effect on
the translation of eIF4E-sensitive mRNAs. Our model explains
recent ﬁndings showing that resistance to BEZ235, a dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, can be acquired through ampliﬁcation
of the eIF4E gene (44). Thus, our results support a model
whereby an elevated eIF4E/4E-BP ratio renders tumors resistant not only to asTORi (Fig. 4G) but also to dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors.
Recent studies have proposed that the combination of
mitogen-activated protein kinase with mTOR inhibitors
could overcome resistance to mTOR inhibitors (42, 45). However, data presented here raise the possibility that using
therapies that target eIF4E in the tumor (21, 36) may be more
beneﬁcial in cases where elevated eIF4E/4E-BP ratio is present.
Moreover, our ﬁndings strongly suggest that the eIF4E/4E-BP
ratio could serve as a predictive marker to tailor personalized
treatments using asTORi in the clinic.
