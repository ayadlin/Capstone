ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is characterized by an extremely poor
prognosis. An inflammatory microenvironment triggers the pronounced desmoplasia,
the selection of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and therapy resistance. The antiinflammatory drug aspirin is suggested to lower the risk for PDA and to improve the
treatment, although available results are conflicting and the effect of aspirin to CSC
characteristics and desmoplasia in PDA has not yet been investigated. We characterized
the influence of aspirin on CSC features, stromal reactions and gemcitabine resistance.
Four established and 3 primary PDA cell lines, non-malignant cells, 3 patient tumorderived CSC-enriched spheroidal cultures and tissues from patients who did or did
not receive aspirin before surgery were analyzed using MTT assays, flow cytometry,
colony and spheroid formation assays, Western blot analysis, antibody protein arrays,
electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), immunohistochemistry and in vivo
xenotransplantation. Aspirin significantly induced apoptosis and reduced the viability,
self-renewal potential, and expression of proteins involved in inflammation and stem
cell signaling. Aspirin also reduced the growth and invasion of tumors in vivo, and
it significantly prolonged the survival of mice with orthotopic pancreatic xenografts
in combination with gemcitabine. This was associated with a decreased expression
of markers for progression, inflammation and desmoplasia. These findings were
confirmed in tissue samples obtained from patients who had or had not taken aspirin
before surgery. Importantly, aspirin sensitized cells that were resistant to gemcitabine
and thereby enhanced the therapeutic efficacy. Aspirin showed no obvious toxic effects
on normal cells, chick embryos or mice. These results highlight aspirin as an effective,
inexpensive and well-tolerated co-treatment to target inflammation, desmoplasia and
CSC features PDA.

to the fibrotic nature of PDA that prevents even small
therapeutic molecules from entering and perfusing the
extremely dense extracellular matrix (ECM) [2]. This
desmoplasia is derived from pancreatic stellate cells that
are activated by inflammation and in turn proliferate
and produce collagens, fibronectin and other ECM
components, which participate in cancer initiation,
progression and metastasis [3–6].

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one
of the most aggressive malignancies and is typically
diagnosed at an advanced state, with extensive local
invasion, early systemic dissemination and marked
resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy [1]. The poor
response to chemotherapy is thought to be due in part

Increased expression of cancer stem cell (CSC)
markers, including c-Met, CD133, CD44, EpCAM (also
known as ESA), ALDH1, Nanog, Oct4 and SOX2, has
been identified in PDA [7, 8]. According to the CSC
hypothesis, stem-like cancer cells exhibit properties of
normal stem cells, such as chemotherapy resistance, high
DNA repair capacity, apoptosis resistance and self-renewal
potential, with the latter being characterized by the ability
to form spheroids and colonies and to recapitulate a tumor
after xenotransplantation [9]. Furthermore, recent studies
indicate a role for aberrantly high NF-κB activity in
providing signals that maintain mammary CSCs [10] and
demonstrate that constitutively enhanced NF-κB binding
of the subunits c-Rel and p65 confers CSC features in
highly aggressive PDA cells [11].
Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is a potent inhibitor of
NF-κB signaling [12, 13], suggesting that this drug may
contribute to the elimination of pancreatic CSCs; however,
to our knowledge, this issue has not yet been studied.
Aspirin is based on salicylic acid, the active ingredient
from willow bark, which has been used since antiquity
for the treatment of headaches, pain and fever [14]. In
1897, the derivate acetylsalicylic acid was synthesized by
Felix Hoffman, and it caused less digestive distress than
pure salicylic acid [14]. The most understood molecular
effect of aspirin is the inhibition of COX-2, and aspirin
is widely prescribed for the prevention of cardiovascular
events due do its blood-thinning properties [15]. However,
an increasing body of evidence supports a role for aspirin
in cancer prevention and in the reduction of metastasis and
mortality, especially for colon cancer [16, 17]. In PDA, a
decreased cancer risk associated with aspirin was observed
in a prospective study conducted from 1992 through 1999
in the US among 28,283 post-menopausal women; among
80 incident cases of pancreatic cancer, the authors stated
that 43% of pancreatic cancer cases among non-users of
aspirin might have been prevented by the daily intake of
aspirin [18]. An analysis of individual patient data from
8 randomized clinical trials reported that long-term daily
aspirin use significantly reduced deaths due to PDA, with
the greatest benefit obtained after 5 years of aspirin use
[17]. These results were confirmed with transgenic mice,
where aspirin significantly inhibited the progression of
pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and tumor
formation [19], and together with gemcitabine, extended
survival [20]. However, data gathered as part of the
Nurses´ Health Study involving almost 90,000 women in
the US indicated that women who took 2 or more standard
aspirin tablets per week for more than 20 years had a 59%
increased risk of PDA compared with women who rarely,
or never, used the medication [21].
To shed new light on the still conflicting role
of aspirin in PDA, we evaluated the efficacy of this
drug in the elimination of CSC features. We found that
aspirin inhibited the potential for self-renewal, stem cell
signaling, tumor growth and invasion along with inhibition
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of markers for inflammation and it sensitized PDA to
gemcitabine-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo.
Most importantly, aspirin diminished the levels of ECM
components and had no toxic side effects.

RESULTS
Aspirin increases the therapeutic efficacy of
gemcitabine
To evaluate the effect of aspirin on gemcitabine
responsiveness, we examined 4 established PDA cell
lines with different grades of aggressiveness [11, 22]
and gemcitabine resistance (Figure 1A). The cells
were treated with gemcitabine or 3 different aspirin
concentrations, or a combination thereof. Viability, cell
morphology and apoptosis were determined 72 h after
treatment according to the MTT assay, microscopy, and
staining with AnnexinV-FITC followed by flow cytometry,
respectively (Figure 1A, Figure S1A, S1B). Whereas
gemcitabine was effective in sensitive BxPc-3 cells, as
expected, it was minimally effective in median resistant
PANC-1 cells and non-effective in the totally resistant
BxPc-3/GEM and AsPC-1 cells. In contrast, aspirin
at doses of 5 and 10 mM was effective in all cell lines,
and aspirin treatment significantly increased the efficacy
of gemcitabine upon combination. These results were
confirmed in the primary, low-passage, human PDA cell
lines PaCaDD135 (gemcitabine-sensitive), PaCaDD159
(median gemcitabine-resistant) and PaCaDD183
(totally gemcitabine-resistant), which were in passage 5
(Figure 1B). Most importantly, aspirin did not significantly
affect the viability of non-malignant human primary MSCs
or immortalized human pancreatic ductal CRL-4023 cells,
in contrast to gemcitabine, which significantly reduced the
viability of MSCs and CRL-4023 cells (Figure 1C).
To assess the mechanism responsible for these
results, we examined the expression of the aspirin
target TNF-α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, which
induces NF-κB activity [13, 23], and the self-renewal
and stem cell markers Oct4, Nanog and SOX2 [7, 8] by
Western blot analysis. Treatment of cells with aspirin
for 48 h significantly reduced the expression of these
proteins, which was further decreased by combination
treatment with gemcitabine (Figure 1D). These results
were confirmed using the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell
Antibody Protein Array, which demonstrated significant
aspirin-induced inhibition of Oct-3/4, SOX2 and Nanog
protein levels in PANC-1 cells, along with the induction
of E-Cadherin and inhibition of α-Fetoprotein, PDX-1,
SOX17, Otx2, TP63, Goosecoid, VEGFR-2, HCG,
GATA-4, FoxA2 and Snail (Figure S1C). Moreover,
aspirin inhibited the binding activity of NF–κB (Figure
S2A), whose activity has been linked to CSC features
[11]. In contrast, gemcitabine reduced the NF-κB binding
activity only in low aggressive BxPc-3 cells and had

no effect, or led to increased NF-κB binding, in more
aggressive cells. Remarkably, gemcitabine-induced NF-κB
activity was reduced to below basal levels in combination
with aspirin. Furthermore, expression of the NF-κB
subunits cRel, p65 and p52 was inhibited by aspirin,
with increased effects upon combination treatment, as
determined by Western blot analysis (Figure S2B).
To study the influence of aspirin on the potential
for self-renewal, AsPC-1 and PANC-1 cells were
treated and then seeded for colony formation. After
two weeks, aspirin and gemcitabine alone significantly
inhibited colony formation in the more aggressive cells,
and combination treatment exhibited an even stronger
effect (Figure 2A, Prevention, Figure S2C). In a second
approach, full-grown colonies were treated with the result,

that aspirin reduced the survival fraction of colonies much
stronger than in the prevention experiment (Figure 2A,
Reduction). This variance between the prevention
and protection assays may be expected, because the
experimental settings differ. To assess the effect on tumor
growth, we used xenotransplantation to fertilized chick
eggs, which is an in vivo replacement method for mouse
studies. Chick embryos are naturally immunodeficient and
immunocompetence in birds develops only after hatching
[24]. Thus, the situation resembles immunocompromised
mice. Most importantly, the chorioallantoismembrane
(CAM) of the chick embryo is non-innervated and
therefore the chick embryo does not feel pain by
CAM transplantation and tumor growth on the CAM
[25–27], as mice do by the subcutaneous or orthotopic

Figure 2: Aspirin inhibits the potential for self-renewal and enhances gemcitabine efficacy. (A) AsPC-1 and PANC-1 cells

were treated as described in Figure 1A, followed by re-plating of viable cells 48 h later at a low density (AsPC-1: 400 cells/well; PANC-1:
800 cells/well) in 6-well plates. After two weeks, colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted using a dissecting microscope. The
number of surviving colonies in the control was set to 1, and the survival fraction is presented on the left (Prevention). The diagrams on the

were treated as described. After an additional 5 days, clonogenic survival was analyzed as described above. Representative photographs
of fixed and Coomassie-stained PANC-1 colonies in the prevention experiment are presented on the left. (B) PANC-1 cells were treated
as described, and 48 h later, the cells were transplanted onto the CAM of fertilized chick eggs at day 8 of embryonic development. At day
17, the percentage of engraftment (tumor take) and the tumor volumes were evaluated. Photographs of a developed xenograft on the CAM
(white, dotted line) and a resected xenograft tumor are shown on the right. The volumes of individual tumors (dots) and the means of each

transplantation procedure and subsequent tumor growth.
PANC-1 cells were treated in vitro and then transplanted
to the CAM of fertilized chick eggs (Figure 2B). Both
aspirin and gemcitabine reduced the engraftment efficacy
(percentage of tumor take) and the tumor volumes, and the
combination treatment led to the most pronounced effect.
These results were confirmed by treatment of AsPC-1- and
PANC-1-derived spheroids and the measurement of viable
spheroids after treatment (Figure 3A, 1st generation).
Aspirin and gemcitabine both significantly reduced the
percentage of spheroids, but both together were strongest.
This effect was even more pronounced upon re-seeding of
surviving cells for spheroid formation and a second round
of treatment, followed by the evaluation of surviving
spheroidal-growing cells (Figure 3A, 2nd generation).
Moreover, the measurement of aldehyde dehydrogenase
isoform 1 (ALDH1) activity, which is defined as a marker
for self-renewal capacity [28], confirmed that aspirin

inhibited the potential for self-renewal (Figure 3B). These
data suggest, that aspirin increases the therapeutic efficacy
of gemcitabine by inhibition of inflammatory proteins and
the self-renewal potential of CSCs.

Aspirin eliminates patient-derived CSCs
To extend these data, we used human primary
CSC marker-enriched spheroidal-growing PDA cells
isolated from resected PDA tissues from 3 different
patients (T22, T29, and T30) (Table 1) followed by
serial transplantation to mice (Figure 4A). At passage
6–12, the tumor cells were isolated from xenografts
and cultured anchorage-independently in vitro, as we
described previously [22, 29]. During this procedure,
the highly aggressive cancer cells are enriched by clonal
selection, which was confirmed by the enrichment of the
CSC markers CD133 and c-Met from below 20% in the

PANC-1 cells were seeded at a clonal density (1.0–2.0 × 103 cells/mL) in ultra-low attachment plates with serum-free, but growth factorcontaining, medium for spheroid formation. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were treated as described, and then 72 h later, the percentage
of viable spheroids was determined (1st Gen). The number of spheroids in the control was set to 100%. Thereafter, 1st Gen spheroids were
dissociated to single cells, and equal numbers of live cells were re-plated at a concentration of 1.0–2.0 × 103 cells/mL. Upon spheroid
formation 72 h later, the cells were photographed at 100× magnification (left images) and quantified as described above (2nd Gen). The
bar indicates 100 μm. (B) AsPC-1 and PANC-1 cells were treated as described above, and 48 h later, ALDH1 activity was analysed using
a substrate assay and flow cytometry. Western blot analysis of ALDH1 protein expression in AsPC-1 cells 48 h after treatment is shown on
the left. The data are presented as means ± SD (**P < 0.01, *P < 0.05).

primary tumor to about 80% in the spheroidal cultures
[22, 29]. The rational for this procedure was that a similar
selection occurs in patient tumors: At the beginning of
the disease most of tumors respond to chemotherapy,
but after several cycles, the tumor acquires resistance,
and this may be due to the clonal selection of the highly
resistant cancer cells. The isolated primary CSCs were
exposed to aspirin, gemcitabine, or both in combination.
Five days later, the number of viable spheroids from the
first generation (1st Gen) was evaluated, followed by a
second round of treatment (2nd Gen). Whereas aspirin
and gemcitabine alone reduced the percentage and size
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the spheroids, combination treatment was significantly
more effective and almost completely prevented the
generation of secondary spheroids (Figure 4B). To
evaluate the underlying signaling events, primary CSCs
were collected on a microscope slide following cytospin
centrifugation 72 h after treatment and then examined by
immunohistochemistry and counting the percentage of
positive cells. Aspirin and gemcitabine led to a significant
reduction of proliferation, as indicated by labeling with
Ki67-specific antibodies, expression of c-Met and SOX-2,
and induction of the active form of caspase-3, indicating
the induction of apoptosis (Figure 4C, Figure S3). These

significant for aspirin and gemcitabine in combination.

gemcitabine alone significantly reduced the tumor volume,
treatment with both in combination nearly completely
prevented tumor formation (Figure 5A). To evaluate the
invasion potential, genomic DNA was prepared from
the CAM surrounding the tumor xenograft and from
liver and lung tissue. Human Alu sequences, reflecting
the presence of invading and metastasizing human cells,
were detected by PCR. Whereas 4 of 6 CAM tissues from
untreated eggs were Alu-positive, none of the tissues from
the aspirin- or gemcitabine-treated groups were positive
(Figure 5B). Alu sequences were not detectable in the
liver or lung in any group, indicating that the xenografts

we examined the effect of aspirin on the deposition of
collagen fibers in pancreatic tissues by trichrome staining
and immunohistochemistry. Aspirin intake inhibited
collagen deposition, whereas gemcitabine had no effect.
However, the combination treatment resembled aspirin
treatment alone, as observed in 3 representative sets of
patient tissues (Figure 8A). Likewise, the expression
of αSMA, which marks active, collagen-producing
stellate cells, was strongly inhibited by both aspirin and
gemcitabine, although no additional effect was observed
with combination treatment (Figure 8B). These results
strongly point to the direction, that aspirin may prevent
progression of PDA by inhibition of the inflammatory
response and thus the desmoplastic reaction.

did not spread to other organs (Figure S4A). In addition,
we observed neither significant change in body weight of
the embryos nor liver necrosis or developmental effects,
indicating that the treatment was well tolerated (Figure
S4B, S4C). Immunohistochemical staining for c-Met,
CD133, SOX2, Ki67, cleaved fragment of caspase-3, p65
and c-Rel indicated that both single treatments reduced the
proliferation and the expression of CSC markers and NF-κB
subunits and induced apoptosis, although the combination
treatment was most effective (Figure 5C); these findings
were confirmed by immunofluorescence-double staining of
the CSC markers EpCAM and Ki67 (Figure S4D).
To further confirm these data, we xenotransplanted
PANC-1 cells orthotopically to the pancreas of
immunodeficient mice followed by treatment with aspirin
or gemcitabine. Aspirin was used in a dose of 200 mg/kg,
according to a publication, in which the same concentration
was successfully used for the treatment of mice with
orthotopically growing PANC-1 xenografts [30]. The
administration of aspirin or gemcitabine alone decreased
tumor growth, but the combination of both agents
significantly inhibited tumor formation (Figure 6A). These
results are reflected by the survival time of mice of each
group, which was significantly longer in the combination
group (Figure 6B). Also, there was a significant longer
survival of gemcitabine-treated mice upon co-treatment
with aspirin. No macroscopic metastases were detected
in the livers and lungs, but we observed two mice in the
control group and one mouse in the gemcitabine group
with celiac implantation metastasis, while no metastases
were detected in the aspirin and combination groups (data
not shown). While aspirin had no obvious side effects, as
evident from measures of body weight, plasma creatinine
and urea nitrogen, gemcitabine alone or combined
with aspirin significantly reduced the body weight and
increased the plasma creatinine levels (Figure 6C, 6D). In
contrast, liver necrosis was not induced by any treatment
(Figure S5). Immunohistochemical staining of xenograft
tissue from treated mice revealed a reduction in SOX2,
CD133, p65 and TNF-α, as well as the ECM components
fibronectin and collagen, and more pronounced effects were
observed following combination treatment (Figure 6E).

DISCUSSION
Considering the very poor prognosis of patients
with PDA [1], more effective therapeutic strategies are
required to achieve better outcomes. One major problem
with PDA is the associated presence of extremely dense
tumor stroma, which prevents the perfusion of therapeutics
by chemo- and immunotherapy and may form a preventive
niche for the highly aggressive CSC population [2].
Inflammation is known to drive this desmoplastic reaction,
and enhanced activity of the pro-inflammatory signaling
factor NF-κB contributes to the protection of pancreatic
CSCs [3–6, 11]. Our current study demonstrated that
aspirin inhibited CSC features, and this effect involved the
inhibition of inflammatory activity, self-renewal potential,
stem cell marker expression, tumor growth, metastasis and
the stromal reaction.

Aspirin has a preventive effect on the
development of PDA
We observed that aspirin-treated PDA cells showed
impaired potential for self-renewal due to the inhibition
of spheroid and colony formation, ALDH1 activity, CSC
marker expression and impaired tumor engraftment
in vivo. In addition, daily administration of aspirin at a
dose of 200 mg/kg for 5 weeks diminished the growth of
human PDA tumor xenografts transplanted to the pancreas
of immunodeficient mice. These results are in agreement
with recent data obtained in genetically engineered mouse
models of pancreatic cancer, which demonstrated that daily
i.p. injection of 20 mg/kg aspirin delayed the progression
of PanIN and cancer formation [19, 20]. Furthermore, 200
mg/kg aspirin administered daily delayed the growth of
pancreatic cancer in an orthotopic mouse model using
human PANC-1 xenografts [30]. The concentrations of
aspirin administered to mice in vivo may be relevant for
humans, as extrapolation of a 200 mg/kg aspirin mouse
dose to a human dose, considering the surface area for
humans [32], results in a daily aspirin dose of 16 mg/kg,
or 960 mg aspirin for a 60 kg human, which is a dose

Aspirin intake prior to surgery inhibits markers
of tumor progression and collagen deposition in
patient tissues
To examine the impact of aspirin in PDA patients,
we examined tissues from patients that had taken aspirin
(n = 5), gemcitabine (n = 4), both together (n = 3) or
neither (n = 4) prior to resection (compare Table 1). In
accordance with the former in ovo and mouse xenograft
results, aspirin intake reduced the expression of Ki67,
c-Met, CxCR4, CD44, and TNF-α (Figure 7). Because
a recent multicenter retrospective study suggested a
reduction in liver fibrosis mediated by aspirin [31],

Aspirin enhances the therapeutic efficacy of
gemcitabine

in Connecticut between 2005 and 2009. A dose of 75 to
325 mg aspirin/day was administered for the prevention
of heart disease but was found to reduce the risk of PDA
by 48% after 3 years of treatment and by 60% after 20
years of treatment. Our findings are also consistent with
the report that a low dosage of aspirin reduced colorectal
tumor genesis by 60% among 311 patients with colorectal
adenomas and adenocarcinomas [35]. However, in contrast
to our study, none of these studies addressed the efficacy
of aspirin toward highly aggressive, CSC-like PDA cells.

We proceeded to evaluate the effect of aspirin on
the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine, which has been
suggested to enrich the therapy-resistant CSC population
[39], resulting in progression and metastasis. Our results
demonstrated that aspirin enhanced the ability of gemcitabine
to reduce cell viability and the potential for self-renewal and
to induce apoptosis. These data were further supported by in
vivo findings showing that aspirin led to complete inhibition
of tumor growth, engraftment, invasion and metastasis when
administered in conjunction with gemcitabine. We assume
that this result may be partly due to the observed aspirinmediated inhibition of TNF-α expression and NF-κB activity,
which is induced by gemcitabine in highly aggressive
CSC-like cells. This observation emphasizes the suggested
relation between inflammation and PDA. Indeed, almost
all risk factors for PDA, such as pancreatitis, are associated
with chronic inflammation [40], and activation of NF-κB and
TNF-α is crucial for the development of pancreatitis [41].
These events may be prevented by treatment with aspirin,
which thereby may reduce the risk of developing PDA or
the progression of existing PDA. Previous studies support
this notion and demonstrate that inactivation of the NFκB pathway effectively prevents the formation of human
orthotopically transplanted PDA xenografts in mice [30]
and the formation of inflammation/colitis-associated cancer
in a mouse model [42]. According to the literature and our
own observations, highly gemcitabine-resistant, aggressive
PDA cells possess higher NF-κB activity compared to more
sensitive PDA cells [43], reflecting the role of NF-κB in
conferring CSC features [11]. This scenario emphasizes
the notion that gemcitabine treatment leads to enrichment
of CSCs and thus progression [39], which is prevented by
aspirin co-treatment.

Aspirin primarily targets highly aggressive cells
and is well tolerated
To determine whether aspirin primarily affects
more aggressive cells, we used different strategies.
First we used a set of established PDA cell lines with
documented low, median or high aggressiveness and
found that aspirin mainly affected the more aggressive
and gemcitabine-resistant cells. Second, we demonstrated
that aspirin strongly reduces the self-renewal potential
of established and primary CSC cells by inhibition of
colony- and spheroid formation and ALDH1 activity.
Our data suggest that aspirin eliminates pancreatic
CSCs. Similar results were recently found in colorectal
cancer [36]. In the latter study, Moon and colleagues
demonstrated that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
including indomethasin, sulindac, aspirin, celecoxib,
γ-secretase inhibitor and PPARG antagonist significantly
decreased the number of colosphere formation. In
addition, indomethacin enhanced the efficacy of 5-FU in
mouse tumor xenografts [36], which is in line with our
in vivo data, where we demonstrate that aspirin enhances
the efficacy of gemcitabine in chick or orthotopic mouse
xenografts. Moreover, a study performed by Deng and
colleagues [37] found that celecoxib downregulates
the expression of the CSC marker CD133 through
inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway in colon cancer
cells. This finding supports our data of aspirin-mediated
downregulation of several CSC markers in PDA. To
confirm our observation that aspirin mainly attacks the
highly aggressive pancreatic cancer cells, we examined
the effect of aspirin on non-malignant pancreatic duct
cells and mesenchymal stem cells. We found that aspirin
exhibited no cytotoxicity to these primary cells at a
therapeutically active concentration of 5 mM in vitro.
Likewise, aspirin did not induce adverse side effects in
chick embryos and mice. Although aspirin is known to
increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, this type of
side effect may be tolerable, since it can be prevented with
proton pump inhibitors in patients [38]. More importantly,
long-time daily aspirin use was shown to reduce allcause mortality, including fatal bleeding mortality, by
approximately 10% [17]. Given that cancer-related death
is more serious than non-fatal bleeding complications,
aspirin indeed may hold great potential benefits for both
cancer prevention and treatment.

Aspirin reduces deposition of the ECM
The results obtained from human PDA xenografts in
mice as well as tissues from patients who had or had not
taken aspirin before surgery suggest that aspirin strongly
reduces the deposition of ECM components, such as
fibronectin and collagen, and also leads to a reduction of
αSMA-positive stellate cells. The effect of aspirin on ECM
synthesis in PDA has to our knowledge not been studied.
However, Miltyk and colleagues demonstrated in 1996 that
aspirin evokes a decrease in collagen synthesis in cultured
fibroblasts [44]. A more recent report from 2004 suggested
that the inhibitory effect of aspirin on collagen biosynthesis
in fibroblasts is coupled to the inhibition, but not expression,
of prolidase phosphorylation and to the down-regulation of
the intracellular signal transmitted by the β1-integrin receptor
[45]. Likewise, nickel-induced collagen biosynthesis in
human fibroblasts, which may be responsible for pulmonary
fibrosis upon exposure to nickel compounds by inhalation,
was prevented by aspirin [46]. The obvious clinical

relevance of these findings has recently been confirmed
by a multicenter retrospective study of recurrent hepatitis

conclusion that low-dose aspirin of 75 or 100 mg, given for

the progression of liver fibrosis [31].

previously [22]. Patient materials were obtained under
the approval of the ethical committee of the University of
Heidelberg after receiving written informed consent from
the patients. The diagnoses were established by conventional
clinical and histological criteria according to the World Health
Organization (WHO). All surgical resections were indicated
by the principles and practice of oncological therapy.

CONCLUSION

Cell viability assay

The present study highlights the suggested preventive
and therapeutic effects of aspirin in PDA by demonstrating
the elimination of CSC features, inflammatory factors and
desmoplasia. Because we observed no side effects with aspirin,
our data further support the potential for aspirin to be used in
the prevention of PDA, as well as an adjuvant agent to improve
the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients suffering from PDA.

Cell viability was measured using 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT), as described previously [11].

AnnexinV staining and flow cytometry analysis
of apoptosis
Cells were stained with FITC-conjugated AnnexinV
(BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) after respective
treatments and analysed by flow cytometry, as described
previously [11].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human primary and established PDA cell lines
The established human PDA cell lines PANC-1,
AsPC-1, and BxPc-3 and the human hTERT-HPNE
immortalized pancreatic ductal cell line CRL-4023 were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) and cultured in DMEM (18 mmol/L glucose)
supplemented with 10% FCS and 5% HEPES or in ATCC
complete growth medium, respectively. Gemcitabineresistant BxPc-3 cells (BxPc-3/GEM) have been described
[11]. Human primary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
and the primary PDA cell lines PaCaDD183, PaCaDD159
and PaCaDD135 were isolated and cultured as previously
described [11, 47]. All cells were grown in a humidified
incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 and authenticated throughout
the culture by their typical morphology. The established cell
lines were recently authenticated by a commercial service
(Multiplexion, Heidelberg, Germany). Mycoplasma-negative
cultures were ensured through monthly mycoplasma tests.

ALDH1 activity
ALDEFLUOR substrate (5 μL; Aldagen, Inc.,
Durham, NC, USA) was added to 1 × 106 treated tumour
cells, and ALDH1 activity was measured by flow cytometry
analysis according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Nuclear protein extracts were prepared using NEPER® Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents,
and the bandshift reaction was performed using the Light
Shift® Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Scientific), and biotin
3´end-labeled oligonucleotides or unlabelled oligonucleotides
(MWG Biotech), as described previously [22].

Colony-forming assay

Reagents

Forty-eight hours after treatment, the cells were
re-seeded in complete medium in 6-well tissue culture
plates. Colonies were evaluated 14 days later, as described
previously [11].

Aspirin (> 99% pure, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim,
Germany) was dissolved in ddH2O to prepare a 0.5 M, pH
7.0 stock solution and stored in aliquots at −20°C. Each stock
solution was used only once immediately after thawing.
Gemcitabine solution (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA)
was diluted in cell culture medium to prepare a 100 μM
stock solution, and aliquots were stored at −20°C. The final
concentrations of the solvents in the media were 0.1% or less.

Spheroid assay
Tumor cells were cultured in human NeuroCult
NS-A serum-free medium with supplements (Stem Cell
Technologies, Inc.), and analysis of spheroid formation
was performed as described previously [11].

Cruz, CA, USA) were used.

after the mouse was placed under general anesthesia.
To avoid possible leakage of tumor cells, the injection
was performed using a Leica M651 microscope (Leica,
Wetzlar, Germany). Mice carrying PANC-1 xenografts
were randomly divided into 4 groups of 12 animals
each, which received the following intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injections starting at day 7 after tumor transplantation:
Control group: H2O daily; Aspirin group: 200 mg/kg
daily; Gemcitabine group: 12.5 mg/kg once per week;
Combination group: 200 mg aspirin/kg daily and 12.5 mg
gemcitabine/kg once per week. Six mice of each group
were sacrificed at week 6, and tumor volumes (V) were
determined using two diameters and were calculated using
the following formula: V = 1/2 (length × width2). The
residual 6 mice of each group were observed and the time
to death was documented. The animals were euthanized
in case of ascites formation or other signs of suffering.
Animal experiments were performed in the animal
facilities of the University of Heidelberg after receiving
approval from the authorities (Regierungspräsidium
Karlsruhe, Germany).

Transplantation of tumor cells to the
chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of fertilized
chick eggs
Fertilized eggs from genetically identical hybrid
Lohman Brown (LB) chicks were obtained from a local
ecological hatchery (Geflügelzucht Hockenberger,
Eppingen, Germany). Tumor cells were transplanted to the
CAM, followed by treatment and evaluation of tumor take
and volume, as described previously [22].

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
staining

Statistical analysis

Staining was performed on 6-μm frozen or
paraffin-embedded tissue sections or on primary
spheroidal cultures that were transferred to glass slides
by cytospin centrifugation, as described previously
[22, 29]. The primary antibodies were: Rabbit
pAbs against human c-Met, CD133, Sox2 (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), CD44 (GeneTex Inc., USA); Ki67
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA); the cleaved
fragment of activated human caspase-3 (R&D Systems,
Abingdon, UK); c-Rel (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.,
Germany); CxCR4 (GeneTex Inc., USA); Fibronectin
and Collagen type I (Acris Antibodies GmbH, Herford,
Germany); Rabbit mAb against TNF-α and p65
(Rel A, Cell Signalling Danvers, MA, USA); Mouse
mAb against TNF-α (Cell Signaling) and α-smooth
muscle actin (αSMA, α-Actin clone 1A4, Santa Cruz,
Heidelberg, Germany).

Data obtained with established and primary cell
lines are presented as the means ± SD from at least three
separate experiments, each performed in triplicate. The
experiments with primary spheroidal cells were performed
twice in triplicate due to the limitation of patient-derived,
primary spheroids. The significance of the data was
analyzed using Student’s t-test for parametric data and
the Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni corrections for
nonparametric data. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant (**P < 0.01, *P < 0.05).
