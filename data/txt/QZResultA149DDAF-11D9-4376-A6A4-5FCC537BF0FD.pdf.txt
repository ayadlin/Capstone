ABSTRACT
Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma that can
affect the skin, blood, and lymph nodes, and can metastasize at late stages. Novel
therapies that target all affected disease compartments and provide longer lasting
responses while being safe are needed. One potential therapeutic target is NF-κB, a
regulator of immune responses and an important participant in carcinogenesis and
cancer progression. As a transcription factor, NF-κB targets genes that promote cell
proliferation and survival. Constitutive or aberrant activation of NF-κB is encountered
in many types of cancer, including CTCL.
Recently, while analyzing gene-expression profiles of a variety of small
molecule compounds that target NF-κB, we discovered the tetracycline
family of antibiotics, including doxycycline, to be potent inhibitors of the NF-κB
pathway. Doxycycline is well-tolerated, safe, and inexpensive; and is commonly
used as an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory for the treatment a multitude of medical
conditions.
In our current study, we show that doxycycline induces apoptosis in a dose
dependent manner in multiple different cell lines from patients with the two most
common subtypes of CTCL, Mycosis Fungoides (MF) and Sézary Syndrome (SS). Similar
results were found using primary CD4+ T cells from a patient with SS. Doxycycline
inhibits TNF induced NF-κB activation and reduces expression of NF-κB dependent antiapoptotic proteins, such as BCL2α. Furthermore, we have identified that doxycycline
induces apoptosis through reactive oxygen species.

be associated with severe pruritus that often reduces
quality of life [2]. Although the median survival can
vary from 10-35 years in those with early stage disease,
this drastically reduces to only 1.5 years for those with
advanced staged disease [3]. Additionally, one in four
people with early stage disease progress to more advanced
stages with a drastic reduction in overall survival rate to
4 years [4, 5].
The heterogeneity in the histological and clinical
presentations of CTCL presents a challenge to clinicians
despite recent advances in treatment options for this

INTRODUCTION
Cutaneous T-cell Lymphomas (CTCL) are rare
forms of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas that encompass
about half of all mature T-cell malignancies and primarily
involve the skin [1]. Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary
Syndrome (SS) encompass about half of all CTCLs. MF
is characterized by the presence of patches, plaques, or
tumors, and in more advanced stages, it can present with
erythroderma, affect the blood and lymph nodes, and
metastasize to other organs [2]. Both MF and SS may

disease [2, 6, 7]. There is an unmet need for therapies that
can be effective in all disease compartments while being
safe [2, 7]. There are currently few systemic therapies
available, and these have overall response rates of 20-45%
and complete response rates of less than 20%. The highest
median duration of response is 15 months [8–11]. Many
of these patients do not respond to standard chemotherapy
[12]. Moreover, the toxicities of these therapies are often
significant. Therefore, new therapies that are effective,
safe, and tolerable are needed [13].
The “Connectivity Map” is a research effort of
the Broad Institute that links gene expression patterns
produced after treatment with over 1,300 small-molecule
compounds [14]. This map facilitates the discovery
of new drugs for the treatment of diseases by allowing
researchers to screen for compounds that could target
genes known to be involved in pathways of disease,
such as those controlled by transcription factor NF-κB.
NF-κB regulates genes that promote cell proliferation,
metastasis, angiogenesis, invasion, inflammation, and cell
survival. NF-κB is a key regulator of immune response
and important in carcinogenesis and cancer progression
[15]. Constitutive expression of NF-κB is associated with
a multitude of cancers, including CTCL [16–19]. We
previously reported our effort to identify novel targets
of the NF-κB pathway using the Connectivity map and
doxycycline was identified as a novel inhibitor of this
pathway [20].
Doxycycline is an inexpensive and widely used
tetracycline, commonly known for its antibiotic properties,
that was first synthesized from chlortetracycline in 1967
[21]. Chlortetracycline is the parent structure for all
tetracyclines and is naturally found in Streptomyces
aureofaciens [22]. Doxycycline’s antibiotic effects
come from its ability to bind to the bacterial ribosome’s
30s subunit and inhibit protein synthesis. This makes it
capable of treating both gram positive and gram negative
bacterial infections.
Independent from its antimicrobial activities,
doxycycline has a vast range of pharmacological
properties, including its ability to suppress inflammation
due to inhibition of metalloproteinases, hydrolases, and
cytokine production [23, 24]. Thus, it has been utilized
for the treatment of various conditions, including
cardiovascular and neurological disorders, periodontal
disease, malaria, rickettsial and chlamydial infections,
Lyme disease, and inflammatory dermatologic disorders
such as rosacea, acne vulgaris, and bullous pemphigoid
[25–27]. Doxycycline is usually well tolerated and has a
low side-effect profile [28]. These therapeutic benefits,
along with its inhibitory effect on NF-κB target genes,
and its commercial availability, significantly reduces the
amount of time it would take to bring a drug to the market,
which prompted us to study the effects of doxycycline in
cells from patients with CTCL.

Doxycycline treatment of CTCL cell lines leads
to cell death
Doxycycline was added at varying concentrations
to actively growing cell lines H9, Hut78, HH, MyLa,
and MJ. Viability was assessed using trypan blue after 4
days of treatment (Figure 1A–1E). Most of the cell lines,
including H9, HH, Hut78, and MyLa, were killed by
doxycycline in a dose dependent manner. However, MJ
showed more resistance to doxycycline killing. Although
there was some cell cycle arrest observed in the MJ cells
at higher concentrations of doxycycline, even after 7 days
of treatment, at the highest dose of doxycycline, MJ cells
were still viable compared to the sensitive cell lines that
showed essentially 100% killing after 4 days (data not
shown).
These results were interesting as they correlated
with results that were discovered while examining NFκB activity in these CTCL cell lines. IκBα keeps NF-κB
sequestered in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing it from
performing its function as a transcription factor in the
nucleus. TNFα (TNF) induces phosphorylation of IκBα,
triggering its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation
in the proteasome. This frees NF-κB in the cytoplasm
to migrate into the nucleus and transcribe genes that
are crucial for cell survival and proliferation [29–31].
Interestingly, the sensitivity to doxycycline killing
(Figure 1A–1E) correlated with the cell line’s ability to
induce NF-κB (Figure 2A–2B). TNF treatment increased
NF-κB pathway activation in Hut78, H9, MyLa, and HH
cell lines (Figure 2A). In contrast, despite changes in
baseline NF-κB pathway activation, we did not observe
increased phosphorylation of IκBα in either MJ or
Hut102 cells after TNF stimulation (Figure 2B). This
suggests that CTCLs may have multiple mechanisms
through which NF-κB is activated, as is known to occur
in Activated B-cell like (ABC) and Germinal Center
B-like (GBC) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas [16,
32]. Interestingly, of the CTCL cell lines studied, both
MJ and Hut102 are known to be HTLV positive while
the others (Hut78, H9, MyLa, and HH), and, in fact
most primary CTCLs, are known to be HTLV negative.
This is of particular interest given that HTLV Tax has
pleiotropic effects on the NF-κB pathway and is well
known to activate both canonical and non-canonical NFκB pathways [33].

Doxycycline inhibits NF-κB in CTCL cell lines
We have previously shown that doxycycline is an
inhibitor of NF-κB in some cell lines [20]. Given that
doxycycline induces cellular killing in CTCL cell lines
that also can be further activated with TNF, we next
examined if doxycycline could inhibit TNF-mediated NF75955

κB activation in these cells. Cells were pretreated with
doxycycline for various times and then stimulated with
TNF for various times. The amount of phosphorylated
IκBα was assessed by western blotting. Cell lines that were
sensitive to doxycycline treatment (H9, MyLa, Hut78,
and HH) (Figure 1A–1D), in which NF-κB was induced
after TNF stimulation (Figure 2A), showed decreased
levels of p-IκBα after TNF stimulation in the presence of
doxycycline (Figure 3A and data not shown). In contrast,
the cell lines that were HTLV-1 positive, had constitutively
high levels of p-IκBα that were not further inducible by
TNF administration (Figure 2B), showed no effect on
p-IκBα levels after TNF stimulation with doxycycline
pretreatment (Figure 3B). Therefore, the cell lines that
were most sensitive to doxycycline killing were those in
which NF-κB was inducible with TNF stimulation. Most
interestingly, we show that doxycycline can block NF-κB

To determine if dying cells were undergoing
programmed cell death after doxycycline treatment, cells
were treated with doxycycline and stained with Annexin V
and either 7AAD or propidium iodide (PI). Live and dead
cells were plotted against Annexin V stains to detect which
ones had undergone programmed cell death (Figure 4).
Similar to the trypan blue exclusion assay results (Figure

cells in a dose dependent manner in H9, MyLa, HH, and
Hut78 CTCL cell lines, while MJ cells were resistant.

in cells additionally treated with the caspase 8 inhibitor.
Collectively, these results show that one mechanism by
which doxycycline induces apoptosis in CTCL cell lines
is through caspase-8, an initiator to the extrinsic pathway
of apoptosis.

The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is important in
doxycycline killing

The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is important in
doxycycline killing

We next examined classic signatures of apoptosis.
There are two main pathways of apoptosis, which differ
in the way that initiator caspases are activated. The
extrinsic pathway is activated through death receptors
and the intrinsic pathway acts through the mitochondria
[34]. These pathways may act separately or together
depending on cell type but eventually converge when
effector caspases are activated [35]. This leads to protein
cleavage, DNA fragmentation, membrane blebbing, and
the formation of apoptotic bodies, which are signature
characteristics of apoptosis [36].
Caspase-8 initiates the extrinsic pathway upon death
receptor ligand ligation and activates downstream effector
caspases such as caspase-3 [37]. Caspase-3 activation
leads to cleavage of PARP-1, a nuclear enzyme involved
in DNA damage repair, which is fragmented into multiple
catalytic components during apoptosis including the
24KDa and 89KDa fragments [37–39]. H9 cells treated
with doxycycline demonstrated decreased levels of
procaspase-3 and increased cleavage of PARP-1 in a dose
dependent manner (Figure 5A), suggesting a potential
role for caspase-8. To further evaluate if caspase-8 had
a role in the programmed cell death observed in CTCL
cells upon treatment with doxycycline, we treated H9
cells with the caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-IETD-FMK (Figure
5B). While late apoptosis was observed in 55.63% of cells
treated with doxycycline alone, this decreased to 17.3%

BCL2α prevents the production of Reactive Oxygen
Species (ROS) at high levels within cells by inhibiting
the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria [40].
Moreover, BCL2a is an NF-κB dependent gene [41]
that has been shown to be expressed in CTCLs [42–44].
Doxycycline treatment of CTCL cell lines correlated with
decreased levels of BCL2α in a dose dependent manner
(Figure 6A). This also correlated with increasing levels of
cytochrome c in the cytoplasm (Figure 6B). These results
suggest involvement of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis
in cells treated with doxycycline, likely due to increased
levels of ROS.

Apoptosis induced by doxycycline is due to
reactive oxygen species
Studies have shown that stimulation of NFκB by TNF activates the anti-oxidative defense in
T-cells, and that inhibition of this pathway results in
excess production of reactive oxygen species [45, 46].
Additionally, ROS have been shown to induce apoptosis
in CTCL cells [47]. Furthermore, a recent study proposed
that a global phenotype that is conserved among cancer
cells is the dependence on mitochondrial biogenesis for
clonal expansion and survival [48]. This study showed
that several classes of FDA-approved antibiotics,
including tetracyclines, can be used to eradicate

cancer stem cells because they target the mitochondria.
Mitochondria are the primary site for the production
of ROS within cells and the resulting oxidative stress
plays a very important role in apoptosis [49]. Due to the
fact that our data suggested that ROS was important in
apoptotic death induced by doxycycline in CTCL cells
(Figure 6A and 6B), we next examined if inhibition of
ROS could rescue cells from apoptosis. H9 and MyLa
were incubated with catalase or flavoprotein inhibitor

diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), both of which block
mitochondria-derived ROS production [50]. Catalase
catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into
oxygen and water. As shown in Figure 6C and 6D,
catalase and DPI significantly reduced the killing effect
of doxycycline. In summary, our results indicate that
doxycycline induced apoptosis is mediated through both
the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis.

and Hut78) and insensitive (MJ) CTCL cell lines were either untreated or treated with the specified concentrations of Doxycycline (10μg/

Doxycycline kills primary malignant T-cells from
a patient with Sézary Syndrome

by doxycycline in a dose dependent manner (Figure 7A).
Additionally, after 48 hours of treatment with doxycycline
40μg/mL, 26.1% of the untreated cells were late apoptotic,
while 85.8% of cells treated with doxycycline had died
through apoptosis (Figure 7B). This was consistent over
several blood draws from different dates. (Data not shown)
A second subject with SS also showed decreased CD4+
T-cell viability upon doxycycline treatment (results not
shown). Lastly, blood samples from a healthy individual
showed that only 11.3% of T-cells underwent apoptosis

To see if doxycycline would induce apoptosis in
primary cells, CD4+ T cells from a patient with Sézary
Syndrome were treated with doxycycline. The patient was
a 68 year old male, who presented with erythroderma. His
flow cytometry showed that 65.72% of all lymphocytes
were CD4+CD26-, 10.95% were CD4+CD7-, and that the
CD4+/CD8+ ratio was 24.33. Trypan blue exclusion assays
showed that CD4+ T-cells from this patient were killed

to untreated control (Figure 7C).

responded to doxycycline treatment, whereas the group
that was insensitive, remained resistant. The fact that
some cells could not be induced with TNF could explain
why some CTCL patients might respond to therapies
that inhibit NF-κB, such as bortezomib, while others do
not. Indeed, previous studies have found a wide range of
sensitivity of CTCL cells to NF-κB inhibition [47].
It is important to note that in our study those cells
that were insensitive to TNFα stimulation and resistant
to doxycycline, MJ and Hut102 cells, were HTLV-1

DISCUSSION
Although doxycycline induces apoptosis in most
CTCL cell lines examined, two subgroups respond to
treatment differently, and this response correlated with
doxycycline’s ability to inhibit phosphorylation of
IκBα. The group that was sensitive to TNFα stimulation

infected. HTLV-1 induces constitutive activation of NFκB through Tax [33]. Tax is a viral protein that binds
directly to the regulatory subunit of the kinase that
phosphorylates IκBα, IKK. Thereafter, IKK constitutively
activates IKKα and IKKβ causing degradation of IκBs,
driving activation of both classical and alternative NFκB pathways [51]. Furthermore, HTLV Tax also exerts
multiple effects on NF-κB-dependent and –independent
transcriptional events in infected cells. Given that MJ
and Hut102 cell lines were insensitive to doxycycline,
we speculate that doxycycline is unable to fully repress
NF-κB, as well as other Tax-induced transcriptional
events. However, given that in patients, CTCL cells are
rarely infected with HTLV-1, it is unclear that this finding
would significantly impact the potential clinical utility of
doxycycline in CTCL treatment.
Consistent with these findings, our results show
that doxycycline can target both Mycosis Fungoides and
Sézary Syndrome cells. Doxycycline induces cell death
through the activation of caspase-8 and the release of
cytochrome c, suggesting the involvement of both the
extracellular and intracellular pathways of apoptosis.
Furthermore, doxycycline’s ability to induce apoptosis in
CTCL cells can be reversed through the inhibition of ROS.
Treatment with oxidants has been shown to be sufficient
when treating inflammatory conditions in which NF-κB is
constitutively active [52]. Through the inhibition of NFκB, as shown by inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation and
decreased BCL2α levels, doxycycline increased ROS in
CTCL cells and triggered apoptosis that could be reversed
through treatment with antioxidants such as catalase and
DPI.
Our results are interesting in light of a recent case
study of a 21 year old female with a 5 year history of
CTCL, primary cutaneous small/medium, pleomorphic
CD4+ T cell lymphoma, who achieved a 13 month
complete remission through oral treatment with
doxycycline monohydrate at a dose of 200mg per day
[53]. Moreover, the idea that antibiotics could be used to
target a conserved weak point among different cancers
was recently suggested by Lamb et al; implying that
doxycycline could be used to treat other types of cancers
as well [48]. We have already shown that doxycycline can
also induce apoptosis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
cell lines [20]. Additionally another study independently
suggested that doxycycline could be used as a therapy in
other cancers [54]. Two additional studies have shown
a potential role for doxycycline in the mammosphereforming activity in breast cancers [55, 56]. Wan et al
showed that doxycycline, in combination with aspirin,
lysine, and mifepristone can prevent and treat cancer
metastasis [57]. Qin et al showed that doxycycline
suppressed proliferation and metastasis of lung cancer
cells [58]. These promising results combined with our
data, warrant further clinical trials on the efficacy of
doxycycline in the treatment of these cancers. A clinical
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

trial to study the efficacy and safety of doxycycline
in patients with relapsed CTCL is underway [59].
Further study will identify the chemical components of
doxycycline that make it a lymphoma killer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue culture
MyLa cells were kindly provided by Andrew
Feldman, M.D., from Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.
Other cell lines were obtained through the American
Tissue Culture Collection. H9, MyLa, HH, and primary
T-cells were kept between 3x105-1x106cells/mL in RPMI
media (Gibco) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine
Serum (FBS, Gibco) and 1% Penicillin and Streptomycin
(Gibco). MJ and Hut78 cell lines were grown in DMEM
(Gibco) supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% Penicillin
and Streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37°C with 5%
CO2.

Doxycycline stock
Doxycycline hyclate (Sigma Aldrich,) stock
solutions were made at 40mg/mL or 10mg/mL in water. A
conversion factor of 93.76% was used to account for the
hyclate. Samples were aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes and
stored at -20°C protected from light. Stock solutions were
diluted to final concentrations with medium.

Trypan blue assays
Cells from pre-established cell lines were plated
at 3x105 cells/mL in 12 well plates and treated with
doxycycline using the indicated concentrations. Primary
cells were plated at 5x105 cells/mL in 96 well round
bottom plates. Cell viability was measured by adding a 1:1
trypan blue: cell sample solution onto a hemocytometer.
Trypan blue was obtained from GIBCO.

Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic extracts
Cytoplasmic extracts were separated from
mitochondria using digitonin fractionation. Briefly, H9
cells were collected, washed with PBS, and resuspended
in cytosolic lysis buffer (250mM Sucrose, 70mM KCl,
200ug/mL digitonin (Cayman), and protease inhibitor
(Pierce Thermo Scientific). After confirming that >95% of
cells had lysed by trypan blue, these were centrifuged at
1,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Supernatant was collected
as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was washed with
PBS, and incubated for 10 minutes at 4°C in mitochondrial
lysis buffer (50mM Tris HCl p.H. 7.4, 150mM NaCl,
2mM EDTA, 2mM EGTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.3%
NP-40, plus protein inhibitor (Pierce Thermo Scientific)).
The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10

minutes and the supernatant collected as the mitochondrial
fraction.

Whole blood was collected in 6ml BD Vacutainer®
plastic tubes with EDTA, and processed no longer than
an hour after collection time. Samples remained at room
temperature until they were processed. Whole blood was
mixed with an equal volume of PBS and layered on top
of Ficoll-Hypaque PLUS(GE)for isolation of peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and centrifuged at
400 x g for 40 minutes with no break. PBMC was then
washed three times with PBS and CD4+ cells were
negatively selected using the CD4+ Human T-cell
isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech). Cells were incubated at a
concentration of 5x105 cells/mL in round bottom 96 well
plates overnight and then treated with doxycycline.

Whole cell lysates
Cells treated with doxycycline for specific times
were removed from the incubator, collected on ice,
pelleted and washed with cold (4°C) PBS. The pellet
was resuspended in RIPA buffer (1X PBS, 1% Nonidet
P-40, 0.5% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS)) with 1:100
Halt Protease and Phosphatase inhibitor (Pierce Thermo
Scientific)). Protein concentration was determined using
BioRad’s DC Protein Assay according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Samples were stored at -80°C.

Reactive oxygen species assays

Western blot analysis

H9 Cells were treated with diphenyleneiodonium
chloride (Cayman) at 0.1μg/mL, 0.5μg/mL and 1μg/mL or
Catalase (Sigma Aldrich) at 200μg/mL, with doxycycline
at 10μg/mL for 48 hours. Apoptosis assay using Annexin
V and 7AAD was done as described above.

Protein lysates (20-25μg) were denatured using
1X Laemmli Buffer and run on 7.5, 10, or 16% SDS
PAGE gels at 100V for about 2 hours. Proteins were then
transferred onto a PDVF membrane (BioRad or Thermo
Fisher Scientific) at 100V for 1 hour. Ponceau-S staining
was done to verify transfer. Non-specific binding was
blocked by incubating the membrane for at least one
hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C in 5% milk
in TBS for non-phosphorylated proteins, or 5% Bovine
serum albumin (BSA Fraction V, Fisher Scientific) in TBS
for phosphorylated proteins. The membrane was then
blotted with primary antibody diluted in 5% BSA or Milk
in TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). After
an overnight incubation at 4°C, the membrane was washed
with TBST and incubated in the secondary antibody for at
least 2 hours at room temperature in 5% BSA or Milk in
TBST. After washing out the secondary antibody in TBST,
the membrane was exposed to BioRad’s Clarity Western
ECL substrate according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Signal was detected using UltraCruz Autoradiography
Film (Santa Cruz Biotech). Antibodies for GAPDH and
p-IκBα were obtained from Cell Signaling (Catalog #
14C10 and 14D4, respectively). BCL2α, Pro-caspase 3,
PARP-1, and cytochrome c antibodies were obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotech Catalog # SC-7382, SC-7148, SC8007, and SC-271627, respectively.

Caspase 8 inhibition
Inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK (BD Pharmingen) was
added at 2 and 20μg/mL, incubated at 37°C with 5%
Carbon Dioxide for an hour and then treated with
Doxycycline at 10 ug/mL for 48 hours. Annexin V and
7AAD stains were then done as described above.

TNF stimulation
Cells were stimulated with human recombinant TNF
at 10ng/mL for the indicated times at 37°C, collected on
ice, washed with cold PBS once, and lysed for protein
isolation. Lysates were stored at -80°C until further
processing.
