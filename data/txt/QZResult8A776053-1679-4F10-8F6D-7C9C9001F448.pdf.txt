Abstract
Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is an oncogenic transcription/translation factor expressed in >40% of breast
cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis, disease recurrence, and drug resistance. We questioned
whether this may be linked to the ability of YB-1 to induce the expression of genes linked to cancer stem cells
such as CD44 and CD49f. Herein, we report that YB-1 binds the CD44 and CD49f promoters to transcriptionally
upregulate their expressions. The introduction of wild-type (WT) YB-1 or activated P-YB-1S102 stimulated the
production of CD44 and CD49f in MDA-MB-231 and SUM 149 breast cancer cell lines. YB-1–transfected cells
also bound to the CD44 ligand hyaluronan more than the control cells. Similarly, YB-1 was induced in immortalized breast epithelial cells and upregulated CD44. Conversely, silencing YB-1 decreased CD44 expression as
well as reporter activity in SUM 149 cells. In mice, expression of YB-1 in the mammary gland induces CD44 and
CD49f with associated hyperplasia. Further, activated mutant YB-1S102D enhances self-renewal, primary and
secondary mammosphere growth, and soft-agar colony growth, which were reversible via loss of CD44 or
CD49f. We next addressed the consequence of this system on therapeutic responsiveness. Here, we show that
paclitaxel induces P-YB-1S102 expression, nuclear localization of activated YB-1, and CD44 expression. The
overexpression of WT YB-1 promotes mammosphere growth in the presence of paclitaxel. Importantly, targeting YB-1 sensitized the CD44High/CD24Low cells to paclitaxel. In conclusion, YB-1 promotes cancer cell growth
and drug resistance through its induction of CD44 and CD49f. Cancer Res; 70(7); 2840–51. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer relapse confers a poor prognosis, decreasing
survival rates from 80% to 60% when the recurrence is local,
and from 80% to 10% for metastatic disease. Relapse is postulated to be mediated by the persistence of cancer stem
cells that have survived an initial treatment regimen with

radiation (1) and/or chemotherapy (2–4) possibly due to a
selective resistance of the cancer stem cells to these agents.
Human breast cancer stem cells have been identified as a
phenotypically restricted subset of CD44+/CD24−/low cells
that form tumors in immunocompromised mice in limiting
dilution transplant assays (5). The same CD44+/CD24−/low
subset has also been associated with breast tumor mammosphere generation in vitro (3). However, the nature of the essential molecular properties of breast cancer stem cells has
remained poorly defined.
Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is a transcription/translation factor that is commonly overexpressed in many cancers,
including human breast cancer (40%; refs. 6–8). This elevated
expression of YB-1 in human breast cancer correlates with
high rates of relapse (6). Targeted overexpression of YB-1
in the mouse mammary gland leads to the development of
mammary tumors (9), confirming a role of YB-1 as an oncogene in that tissue. YB-1 is directly phosphorylated, and
therefore activated, on its serine 102 site by Akt (10) and even
more potently by ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK; ref. 11), a major
component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway. Thus, YB-1 is positioned as a key player in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK pathways. YB-1
regulates genes that promote breast cancer cell growth and

survival, including EGFR (12), Her-2 (erbB2; ref. 7), PIK3CA
(13), and the MET (c-Met) receptor (14), and is biologically
essential for breast cancer cell growth in vitro (7, 10–12) and
in vivo (15). YB-1 expression has also been shown to be associated with drug resistance via the induction of genes such as
MDR-1 (16, 17). Consistent with this, inhibition of YB-1 was
found to sensitize breast cancer cells to paclitaxel (15), a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used in the clinic to treat
advanced breast cancer. To elucidate the transcriptional
programming activity of YB-1, we did chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip (ChIP-on-chip) assays. This screen
revealed a subset of genes known to be active in and important to a number of stem cell populations, including
c-KIT, BMI-1, members of the WNT and NOTCH signaling
pathways, as well as CD44 and CD49f (also known as α6
integrin; ref. 14). We also found that YB-1 transcripts were
present in purified CD44+CD49f+ subpopulations of primitive
human mammary progenitor cells isolated from normal reduction mammoplasties (14). Taken together, this led us to
test the hypothesis that YB-1 plays a key role as an oncogene
by transactivating genes associated with a cancer stem cell
phenotype.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culturing. The human breast cancer cell
lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and SUM 149 were purchased and maintained as previously described (13, 14).
The cell lines were characterized for CD44 and CD24 expression by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S1A–E). Cell
autofluorescence was taken into account.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. ChIP using a polyclonal chicken antibody to precipitate endogenous YB-1
was done as previously described (7). Three primer sets
were designed to flank seven putative YB-1 binding sites
(ATTG) in the first 2 kb of the CD44 promoter, and similarly, two primer sets flanking eight putative YB-1 binding
sites in the first 2 kb of the CD49f promoter were also
designed. Details are described in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
Immunofluorescence assay. Immunofluorescence assays
were done as previously described (13, 14). Antibodies used
were rat anti-human and anti-mouse FITC-conjugated antiCD49f (1:25, clone GoH3, BD Pharmingen), rat anti-human
phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD44 (1:100, clone 515,
BD Pharmingen), unconjugated rabbit anti-human phosphoYB-1 S102 (P-YB-1 S102 ; 1:100, clone C34A2, Cell Signaling
Technology), and secondary anti-rabbit FITC (1:200; Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Details are described
in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and analysis. A singlecell suspension was achieved by first scraping the adherent
cells and digesting with a dispase solution (Stem Cell Technologies) and DNase (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 10 min. Cells were
diluted in a 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS)-PBS buffer and passed
through a 40-μm cell strainer to achieve a single-cell suspension. The single-cell suspension was stained with anti-CD44
conjugated to PE (BD Pharmingen). 7-Aminoactinomycin D

(7-AAD) viability dye (BD Pharmingen) was added to the 2%
FBS-PBS resuspension buffer. For cell sorting, the top and bottom 10% of cells with the highest and lowest CD44-PE fluorescence were collected into 50% FBS-PBS buffer and seeded
subsequently into a 96-well plate for immunofluorescence
staining or growth assays. Sorted cells were seeded at 1 × 104
per well in 96-well plates. Details are given in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Mammosphere assay. A single-cell suspension of MDAMB-231 or SUM 149 cells was seeded into nonadherent mammosphere culturing conditions and counted after 7 d. The
single cells were seeded into secondary cultures under the
same conditions and counted after 7 d. Cells were dissociated enzymatically into a single-cell suspension with dispase digestion and mechanical dissociation by repeated
pipetting. Cells were seeded at 5 × 103 (MDA-MB-231) and
2 × 104 (SUM 149) per well into Ultra-Low Attachment–
coated six-well culture plates (Corning) in a 1:1 DMEM/F12
(Invitrogen) basal medium freshly supplemented with 20 ng/mL
human basic fibroblast growth factor (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL
epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), 10 μg/mL heparin
(Sigma-Aldrich), and 1:50 B27 supplement without vitamin A
(Sigma-Aldrich). Spheres containing approximately >15 cells
were counted 7 d after seeding. In the self-renewal serial
passaging experiments, all cells from primary mammosphere
cultures were collected, centrifuged at 350 × g for 5 min, and
dissociated into a single-cell suspension with 0.25% trypsin
for 5 min at 37°C and counted.
Soft-agar anchorage-independent growth assay. Softagar assays were done as previously described (13, 14).
MDA-MB-231 and SUM 149 cells were seeded at densities
of 5 × 103 and 1.5 × 104 per well, respectively.
Small interfering RNA transfection. Small interfering
RNAs (siRNA) were transfected into cells using the
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Unless otherwise
specified, in all experiments, 20 nmol/L of siRNAs were incubated with the cells for 96 h before assessment of biochemical/biological effects. Details are described in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Quantitative real-time PCR. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and real-time PCR experiments were done as described
(13, 14). Details are discussed in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
Immunoblotting. Immunoblotting analyses were done as
described previously (7). Antibodies used were as follows:
anti–total YB-1 (1:2,000, #ab12148, Abcam; 1:1,000, #2749,
Cell Signaling Technology; 1:2,000, a polyclonal antibody designed against the COOH terminus of YB-1, produced by
and a generous gift from Dr. Colleen Nelson, University of
British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada), anti–P-YB-1S102
(1:1,000, clone C34A2, Cell Signaling Technology), antiCD44 (1:500, clone EPR1013Y, Abcam), anti-CD49f (1:1,000,
#3750, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Flag (1:2,000, clone
M2, Sigma-Aldrich), anti–total Akt (T-Akt; 1:1000, #9272, Cell
Signaling Technology), anti–pan-actin (1:1,000, #4968, Cell
Signaling Technology), and anti-vinculin (1:1,000, clone
hVIN-1, Sigma-Aldrich).

Dr. Robert Weinberg, Department of Biology, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA; ref. 2) in triplicate us-

for solidification. MDA-MB-231 and SUM 149 cells in singlecell suspension were added in their respective media at 2 ×
103 and 5 × 103 cells per well. Growth was assessed in photographed fields 7 d after seeding.
DNA plasmid transfection. In a six-well plate format, 2 or
4 μg of a Flag:EV, Flag:YB-1WT, or Flag:YB-1S102D plasmid
were transfected with 5 or 10 μL of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively, as specified by the manufacturer's
protocol. Cells were harvested 96 h after transfection.
Stable transfectant cell lines. Stable EV, shYB-1, Flag:EV,
Flag:YB-1WT, and Flag:YB-1S102D cell lines were established by
transfecting 4 μg of DNA constructs as described. G418 (400
μg/mL; Calbiochem, EMD Chemicals) was added to the culture media and replaced every 3 to 4 d. Cells were continually
split at low density to allow for optimal selection of transfectants with acquired G418 resistance.
YB-1 transgenic mouse and mammary gland sectioning.
YB-1 transgenic (Tg 2 line) and wild-type (WT) mice were revived from cryopreserved embryos generated and characterized previously (9), where expression of a human
hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged YB-1 cDNA was controlled by
the ovine β-lactoglobulin promoter. For our study, histologic
sections were obtained from the mammary glands of 6- to
8-mo-old female mice post-lactation after two cycles of mating
and nursing. The mice were mated twice and their pups were
nursed for 3 wk each time. The YB-1 transgenic and control
mice were euthanized at the end of their second lactation
(day 20 to 22 after the birth of the pups) and mammary gland
tissues were collected. The mammary glands were dipped
into Tissue-Tek optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura Finetek USA), frozen, and kept at −80°C. OCT
compound–embedded tissues were sectioned (6 μm) using a
cryostat and placed on Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus glass slides
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and kept at −80°C. The sections
were defrosted at room temperature and incubated with PBS
for 5 min, fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 20 min, and rinsed
twice with PBS. Subsequent immunofluorescence staining and
imaging protocol were done as described above. The only exception is that a primary purified rat anti-mouse CD44 antibody (1:100, clone IM7, BD Pharmingen) and a secondary
antirat Alexa 546 antibody (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) were
used. A HA-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was
used with immunohistochemistry methods. Details are described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Anticancer drug screen and further evaluation of paclitaxel treatment. SUM 149 cells were treated with commonly
used chemotherapeutic agents at 10 μmol/L and cell viability
was assessed as previously described (18). The cells were also

stained with anti-CD44-PE (1:5, clone G44-26, BD Pharmingen) and assessed as previously described (18). SUM 149 cells
were also treated with paclitaxel (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in
DMSO at 10 nmol/L for 48 or 72 h before doing immunoblotting and ChIP as described. MDA-MB-231 Flag:EV and
Flag:YB-1WT cells were treated in monolayer or in the mammosphere assay in the presence of 0 nmol/L or 10 nmol/L of
paclitaxel with DMSO as vehicle control for 7 d. MDA-MB231 cells grown in monolayer had the media changed at
day 4 and cells were harvested for immunoblotting on day 7.
Statistical analysis. All quantitative data are represented
as mean ± SE of three independent experiments. P values
were generated using paired Student's t test, where * denotes
P < 0.05, ** denotes P < 0.01, and *** denotes P < 0.001.

Results
YB-1 binds to upstream regulatory regions of the genes
encoding CD44 and CD49f and regulates their expression.
Several putative YB-1 binding sites were located 2 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site of the CD44 and
CD49f genes, initially identified in a ChIP-on-chip screen
(ref. 14; Fig. 1A, top). To validate these results, we did conventional ChIP analyses and provided direct evidence of
the ability of YB-1 to bind to the promoters of CD44 and
CD49f genes in two human breast cancer cell lines (MDAMB-468 and SUM 149; Fig. 1A, bottom). Immunohistochemical analysis of SUM 149 cells grown either in monolayer
cultures or as xenografts illustrated coincident staining of
P-YB-1S102 and CD44 protein in individual cells (Fig. 1B).
Therefore, we first asked whether the expression of CD44
would fluctuate concordantly with changes in activated
YB-1 (P-YB-1S102). Quantification of this association of CD44
expression with the presence of P-YB-1S102 was shown by
isolating the highest and lowest 10% of CD44-expressing
viable SUM 149 cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) and costaining with CD44 and P-YB-1S102 antibodies.
There, we observed a >2-fold difference in P-YB-1S102 levels
between the subsets expressing the highest and lowest
levels of CD44 (Fig. 1C, top), corresponding to enhanced growth
in mammosphere cultures and soft agar (Fig. 1C, bottom).
We next asked whether YB-1 is a determining regulator of
CD44 and CD49f expression in breast cancer cells by knocking down YB-1 expression in MDA-MB-231 and SUM 149 cells
using three siRNA oligonucleotides designed to target YB-1
transcripts specifically. The result was a decrease in the transcript and protein levels of CD44 and CD49f (Fig. 2A and B).
To obtain stable inhibition of YB-1 expression, SUM 149 cells

MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and SUM 149 cells was achieved via plasmid transfections, visualized by immunoblotting with a Flag antibody, and affected
CD44 and CD49f transcript levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR experiments. Vinculin served as loading control. B, MDA-MB-231
cells stably expressing Flag:EV, Flag:YB-1WT, and Flag:YB-1S102D were analyzed for long-term Flag, CD44, and CD49f expression by immunoblotting.
C, CD44 and CD49f protein expression was induced by Flag:YB-1S102D in SUM 149 cells. D, BGL-YB-1/HA and WT counterpart mammary glands were
collected from 6- to 8-mo-old female mice post-lactation, frozen in OCT compound, and sectioned. Slides were stained with primary CD49f-FITC (green) or
unconjugated CD44 with secondary Alexa 546 Fluor antibody (red) or unconjugated P-YB-1S102 with secondary antirabbit FITC antibody and DAPI.
Representative images of cells from eight mice are shown. Insets, enlarged photographs of the CD44 and CD49f membrane-localized staining. Lactating
mammary glands from the same mice were stained for HA by immunohistochemistry techniques.

YB-1 Regulates CD44 and CD49f

were transfected with anti-YB-1 shRNAs. This produced sustained decreases in CD44 and CD49f transcript and protein
levels as compared with control cells transfected with an
empty vector (EV; Fig. 2C). Stable knockdown of YB-1
transcripts also resulted in a decreased expression of CD104
(β4 integrin), a β-chain partner of CD49f (Fig. 2B and C). Further, YB-1 shRNA–expressing cells showed a 50% decrease in
CD44 promoter activity (Fig. 2D), suggesting YB-1 as a significant regulator of CD44.
Conversely, when we forced a transient elevation in the expression of either Flag:YB-1WT or a constitutively active Flag:
YB-1S102D, increases in CD44 and CD49f transcript levels were
obtained in both cases, with the largest increases resulting
from the constitutively active YB-1 construct (Fig. 3A). A similar
result was seen when these constructs were stably expressed in
the same cells (Fig. 3B). Importantly, we confirmed that a
heightened expression of CD44 and CD49f was concomitantly
induced in the same transfected YB-1–overexpressing cells
(Fig. 3C). Likewise, expression of YB-1 in immortalized breast
epithelial cells, which typically have very little of this protein,
caused a measurable increase in CD44 mRNA and protein
(Supplementary Fig. S2). To functionalize the effect in breast
cancer cells, we determined that MDA-MB-231 cells that stably
express Flag:YB-1WT or Flag:YB-1S102D have a greater affinity
for the CD44 ligand hyaluronan (Supplementary Fig. S3).
To determine whether elevated YB-1 expression would
have a similar effect on the expression of CD44 and CD49f
in primary mammary epithelial cells in vivo, we evaluated the
mammary glands of 6- to 8-month-old transgenic mice expressing human HA-tagged YB-1 cDNA under the control
of the ovine β-lactoglobulin promoter (9). To confirm transgene expression, we stained the tissues for HA and showed
an increase in expression with an associated elevation in
P-YB-1S102 (Fig. 3D, i–ii). These mice had higher levels of
CD49f and CD44 protein (Fig. 3D, iii–iv; Supplementary
Fig. S4A and B) as compared with mammary cells from WT
animals (n = 4 per group). The increased expression of CD49f
in the YB-1 transgenic mice was further validated with a second antibody (Supplementary Fig. S4B). The specificity of the
CD44 antibody staining was confirmed by staining B6/129
CD44−/− mouse kidney cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C). We
also noted that the cells in the mammary glands from the
YB-1 transgenic mice were hyperplastic and displayed atypical nuclei in comparison with those in the WT controls when
stained with H&E (Supplementary Fig. S4D). Taken together,
these findings indicate that YB-1 regulates the expression of

CD44 and CD49f both in human transformed mammary
cells in vitro and in primary mouse mammary cells generated
in vivo.
YB-1–regulated expression of CD44 and CD49f controls
the anchorage-independent growth of transformed breast
cells. To test whether the ability of YB-1 to regulate CD44
and/or CD49f expression was important for YB-1–dependent
tumor cell growth (15), we next examined the effect of
treating MDA-MB-231 cells with anti-CD44 and anti-CD49f
siRNAs on mammosphere formation (Fig. 4A). SiRNAs directed against transcripts for YB-1 as well as CD44 and
CD49f all inhibited primary mammosphere formation by
>50%. Conversely, forced increased expression of Flag:YB1WT or Flag:YB-1S102D increased the yield of mammospheres
by up to 8-fold (Fig. 4B). Moreover, this effect was inhibited if
the Flag:YB-1S102D–expressing cells were treated with either
CD44 or CD49f siRNAs (Fig. 4B). Further, this effect is perpetuated over time through passaging as SUM 149 cells
transduced to obtain stable high expression of either Flag:
YB-1WT or Flag:YB-1S102D also produced a higher number of
cells in mammospheres in secondary nonadherent cultures
than control cells transduced with an empty vector plasmid
(Flag:EV; Fig. 4B), an indicator of cell self-renewal (19, 20).
Consistent with the mammosphere assays, analogous experiments with siRNA-treated MDA-MB-231 and SUM 149 cells
showed both CD44 and CD49f to be required for the clonal
anchorage-independent growth of both of these cell lines in
soft agar (Fig. 4C). CD49f was needed for SUM 149 cells, but
not for MDA-MB-231 cells, to form colonies (Fig. 4C). Conversely, forced expression of Flag:YB-1S102D increased the
ability of transfected cells to grow in soft agar and this was
again blocked when the expression of either CD44 or CD49f
was silenced (Fig. 4C). The ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to
proliferate and form extensive structures in Matrigel cultures
was also inhibited when the cells were pretreated with CD44,
CD49f, or YB-1 siRNAs (Fig. 4D). These findings show a critical role of YB-1 in enabling breast cancer cells to grow in
three-dimensional assays in a manner that is dependent on
the downstream upregulation of CD44 and CD49f. Notably,
the expressions of CD44 and CD49f seem to be interdependent in these cell lines, suggesting a functional association.
Paclitaxel-treated SUM 149 cells show increased expression of YB-1 and CD44. The preceding findings intimate that
the increased expression of YB-1 associated with breast cancer relapse in patients might be due to a selection of cells
showing an increased expression of CD44. To investigate this

Figure 4. CD44 and CD49f are essential for breast cancer cell growth in three-dimensional in vitro assays. A, MDA-MB-231 were incubated with CD44 and
CD49f siRNAs and their respective transcript expression levels were monitored. The ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to form mammospheres was challenged
by knocking down CD44, CD49f, and YB-1 individually with their corresponding siRNAs before seeding into the assay. B, stable G418-selected lines of
MDA-MB-231 and SUM 149 cells expressing Flag:EV, Flag:YB-1WT, and Flag:YB-1S102D were also assayed for their abilities to form mammospheres. The
Flag:YB-1S102D lines of both cell lines were first subjected to CD44 and CD49f siRNA treatments and their mammosphere-forming abilities quantified.
Further, SUM 149 Flag:EV, Flag:YB-1WT, and Flag:YB-1S102D cells were serially passaged in mammosphere cultures. After 7 d in culture, the spheres were
counted, dissociated into single cells, and reseeded into the mammosphere assay. The yield of dissociated single cells obtained after 7 d in secondary
nonadherent cultures was analyzed as a measure of self-renewal. C, the functional roles of both receptors in anchorage-independent growth were analyzed
in a soft-agar assay by single CD44 or CD49f gene knockdowns. MDA-MB-231 Flag:EV, Flag:YB-1WT, and Flag:YB-1S102D cells, as well as Flag:YB-1S102D
cells treated with control, CD44, or CD49f siRNAs, were also examined for their ability to form colonies in soft agar subsequent to the gene knockdowns.
D, MDA-MB-231 cell growth in Matrigel was challenged by pretreating the cells with YB-1, CD44, and CD49f siRNA oligonucleotides. Photographs
were taken on day 7 after cell seeding into Matrigel.

Figure 5. Paclitaxel treatment preferentially selects for breast cancer cells with elevated P-YB-1S102 expression. A, treatment of SUM 149 cells with
10 nmol/L paclitaxel for 48 h increased YB-1 binding to the CD44 promoter based on ChIP. The same cells were harvested for immunoblotting to detect
P-RSKS221/S227, P-YB-1S102, total YB-1, and P-GSK3βS9. Vinculin served as loading control. B, SUM 149 cells were treated with 10 nmol/L paclitaxel
for 72 h to examine CD44 levels. C, in MDA-MB-231 cells, where EV and YB-1 expression vector were stably overexpressed, cells were treated with
10 nmol/L paclitaxel for 7 d and harvested for immunoblotting to assess CD44, exogenous Flag:YB-1, and endogenous total YB-1 levels. Endogenous
total YB-1 served as loading control. D, MDA-MB-231 EV- and YB-1–overexpressing cells were grown in mammosphere cultures in the presence of
DMSO or 10 nmol/L paclitaxel for 7 d. Bar graph represents the percent of spheres obtained in the paclitaxel-treated cultures as compared with DMSO for

possibility, we screened a panel of commonly used anticancer drugs (all at 10 μmol/L) for their ability to kill SUM 149
cells in vitro in parallel with an assessment of the proportion
of CD44High cells present 72 hours later. All compounds killed
>80% of the input cells and the percentage of CD44High cells
among the survivors was consistently higher than that in the
control cells (Supplementary Table S1). The most marked effect in this regard was obtained with paclitaxel treatment,
which produced an almost 10-fold increase in the proportion
of viable CD44High cells (Supplementary Table S1). Next, we
determined that paclitaxel at a much lower and more clinically relevant concentration of 10 nmol/L was able to promote nuclear expression of P-YB-1 S102 (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Likewise, the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin had
the same effect (Supplementary Fig. S5). Related to these
findings, paclitaxel increased YB-1 binding to the CD44 promoter after 48 hours (Fig. 5A), which also induced P-YB-1S102,

correlating with activation of the RSK pathway based on
higher levels of P-RSKS380 and a second substrate, P-GSKβS9
(Fig. 5A). The induction of this pathway then led to increased
CD44 after 72 hours (Fig. 5B). In MDA-MB-231 cells stably
expressing Flag:YB-1WT, after 10 nmol/L paclitaxel treatment,
there was a further increase in CD44 expression and a greater
amount of Flag:YB-1 WT detected per cell on the whole
(Fig. 5C). Further, the Flag:YB-1WT–transfected MDA-MB231 cells formed more mammospheres in the presence of
paclitaxel (10 nmol/L) as compared with control transduced
cells (Fig. 5D). Finally, we sorted the SUM 149 cells for
CD44High/CD24Low by FACS (Fig. 6A) and confirmed enrichment by immunofluorescence, comparing CD44High sorted
cells to unsorted cells for CD44 expression (Fig. 6B). The
CD44High/CD24Low cells were then transfected with YB-1
siRNAs for 48 hours and treated with paclitaxel (10 nmol/L)
for 24 hours. Notably, the CD44High/CD24Low cells treated

with the scrambled control were resistant to paclitaxel; however, if YB-1 was silenced, the growth of this tumor-initiating
cell population was significantly attenuated based on crystal
violet staining (Fig. 6C) and quantification of cell viability by
Hoechst33342 staining (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
Here, we present YB-1 as the first oncogene identified that
induces both CD44 and CD49f. YB-1 uses CD44 and CD49f to
promote self-renewal, mammosphere growth, soft-agar colony formation, and drug resistance in breast cancer cells. The
YB-1/CD44/CD49f relationship was also evident in the mammary glands of YB-1 transgenic mice as well as in immortalized normal breast epithelial cells. These findings have broad
implications given the important role for CD44 in mediating
tumor initiation and cancer relapse. It also gives us some
insight into why YB-1 may be so highly associated with

breast cancer recurrence as previously reported (6). Consistent with this idea, we showed that CD44 cells were resistant
to chemotherapy whereby the agents stimulate YB-1 to bind
to the CD44 promoter. Furthermore, we report that eliminating YB-1 in the CD44High/CD24Low population can improve
cellular response to paclitaxel.
We question whether YB-1 somehow hijacks normal
breast stem cells during neoplastic progression. This extends
our initial finding that YB-1 is detectable in primary mammary progenitor cells from women who have undergone reduction mammoplasties (14). In the study presented herein, we
show that inducing YB-1 in immortalized breast epithelial
cells (HTRY) causes an increase in CD44 mRNA and protein.
Consistent with this, both CD44 and CD49f are selectively expressed on normal stem cells in the breast and other tissues
(21–24). We therefore propose that early activation of YB-1
during mammary tumorigenesis involves a primitive cell
population.

Figure 6. Targeting YB-1 suppresses the growth of CD44High/CD24Low cells. A, SUM 149 cells were analyzed by FACS and the CD44High/CD24Low cells
were collected. B, the sorted cells fractions were profiled by immunofluorescence for CD44 enrichment and compared with the unsorted SUM 149
cells as well as the CD44Low/CD24High cells. C, the CD44High/CD24Low cells were treated with 20 nmol/L YB-1 siRNAs for 48 h and exposed to 10 nmol/L
paclitaxel for 24 h. YB-1 had an inhibitory effect on the growth of the CD44High/CD24Low cells when exposed to paclitaxel based on crystal violet staining.
D, cell viability was quantified using Hoechst33342 staining and the average number was taken relative to the control treated with scrambled siRNA
plus paclitaxel. YB-1 silencing was confirmed by immunoblotting.

CD44 is a widely recognized marker of many cells with
cancer-initiating (5, 25–27) and, in some cases, metastatic activities (28–30). As such, understanding its regulation has implications in tumor cell invasion, escape from apoptosis, and
drug resistance. CD44 couples to a number of receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), c-Met receptor, and CD49f to stimulate signal transduction (14, 31). It also partners with the oncogene RHAMM
to promote signaling through the extracellular signal–
regulated kinase-1/2 pathway whereby CD44 stimulates tumor cell invasion (32, 33). Importantly, CD44 expression is
thought to confer drug resistance by directly inducing downstream stem cell–associated and/or drug-resistant genes, including Nanog and MDR-1, through its interaction with
hyaluronan (34–36). This is attributable to activation of the
PKC and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3
(STAT3) signaling pathways (34–36). Notably, as CD44 expression was increased, cells were less sensitive to paclitaxel
due to STAT3 activation and consequent upregulation of
MDR-1. YB-1 expression has already been reported to be associated with chemoresistance perhaps through the regulation of MDR-1 (16, 17). Bridging these studies is the
evidence for the role of YB-1 in invasion (13) that may also
be attributed to CD44 and CD49f. It is foreseeable that it induces other genes associated with cancer stem cells as well.
We reported that YB-1 also regulates the stem cell–associated
Met receptor (c-Met), EGFR, and Her-2 (erbB2; refs. 7, 14), signaling partners of CD44 and CD49f (37–40), suggesting a cooperative complex on the surface of tumor-initiating cells that
activates downstream pathways such as the PI3K-Akt (40–42)
and MAPK pathways (refs. 33, 43; Supplementary Fig. S6). The

crosstalk between these receptors and their downstream effectors provide interesting opportunities for future therapeutic possibilities. We conclude that YB-1 inhibition may be
a new approach to eliminating tumor-initiating cells and, by
extension, possibly cancer recurrence.
