ABSTRACT:
Recent studies suggest a positive correlation between glycogen synthase
kinase-3 (GSK-3) activation and tumor growth. Currently, it is unclear how both Akt
that inhibits GSK-3 and active GSK-3 are maintained concurrently in tumor cells. We
investigated the role of GSK-3 and the existence of an Akt-resistant pathway for GSK3 activation in prostate cancer cells. Our data show that Src, a non-receptor tyrosine
kinase is responsible for Y216GSK-3 phosphorylation leading to its activation even when
Akt is active. Experiments involving mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking cSrc, Yes
and Fyn, as well as Src activity modulation in prostate cancer cells with constitutively
active (CA-Src) and dominant negative Src (DN-Src) plasmids demonstrated the
integral role of Src in Y216GSK-3 phosphorylation and activity modulation. Inhibition
of GSK-3 with SB415286 in PC3 cells resulted in impaired motility, proliferation and
colony formation. Treatment of PC3 cells with the Src inhibitor dasatinib reduced
Y216
GSK-3 phosphorylation and inhibited proliferation, invasion and micrometastasis
in vitro. Dasatinib treatment of athymic nude mice resulted in impaired growth of
PC3 cell tumor xenograft. Together, we provide novel insight into the Src-mediated
Y216
GSK-3 phosphorylation and activation in prostate cancer cells and reveal the
potential benefits of targeting Src-GSK-3 axis using drugs such as dasatinib.

INTRODUCTION

has also been linked to the development of prostate cancer
[2], demonstrating that Akt activity is indispensable for
prostate cancer development. Our previous studies have
demonstrated that changes in Akt activity results in the
modulation of prostate cancer cell survival, proliferation,
colony formation and tumor growth [3-5] as well as
micrometastasis of prostate cancer cells via inside-out
activation of the cell surface integrin αvβ3, thus aiding the
cellular recognition of specific extracellular matrix (ECM)
proteins abundant in the vascular basement membrane
and bone [6, 7]. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), a
serine-threonine kinase is one of the least characterized
substrate of Akt in prostate cancer cells, whose activity
is inhibited by Akt via phosphorylation at serine 9 and
21 in GSK-3α and GSK-3β isoforms, respectively [8, 9].

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of
cancer-related death among men in the United States.
Although androgen deprivation therapy is an effective
treatment during the early stages of prostate cancer, due
to the uncertainty in the molecular mechanisms leading to
advanced stages of the disease, patients with castrationresistant prostate cancer are left with limited treatment
options which includes chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
or novel oral agents such as abiraterone acetate or
enzalutamide.
Hyper-activation of the PI3 Kinase-Akt pathway due
to PTEN mutation is one of the most common reasons for
prostate cancer [1]. An activating E17K mutation in Akt

Since Akt and GSK-3 activities are known to be regulated
reciprocally, it is not clear how these two kinases can
be simultaneously present in their active form in cancer
cells. This demands further investigation on the specific
role of GSK-3 in cancer cells and in order to characterize
the existence of an Akt-independent mechanism of GSK-3
activity regulation in multiple cancers.
The role of GSK-3 in various cellular functions
has been controversial. For example, cell migration, an
integral aspect of invasiveness and metastasis of cancer
cells is promoted by the local inhibition of GSK-3, but
global inhibition impairs cell spreading and migration
[10]. Similarly, controversial data were demonstrated
when cell proliferation and apoptosis was examined.
Some studies have shown that GSK-3β knockout mice are
sensitized to apoptosis and die in the embryonic stage [11],
while others have shown that over-expression of GSK-3β
induces apoptosis [12]. Nevertheless, due to its importance
in numerous of cellular functions, GSK-3 activity is tightly
regulated via phosphorylation at multiple serine, threonine
and tyrosine residues by various kinases. In addition to
the Akt phosphorylated Ser21/9 residue, previous studies
have indicated the existence of a tyrosine residue in GSK3 (Y279 in GSK-3α and Y216 in GSK-3β) that may be
necessary for its complete activation [13-15]. However,
the tyrosine kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of
GSK-3 Y216 is still under investigation.
It has been reported that mostly GSK-3β expression
is up-regulated in many types of cancer, including prostate
cancer [16-21]. Analyses of prostate cancer patient
samples have demonstrated a positive correlation between
increased levels of cytoplasmic GSK-3β, clinical stage
and Gleason score [22]. Compared to normal prostate,
GSK-3α and GSK-3β were up-regulated in prostate
cancer with GSK-3α elevated in low Gleason tumors
and GSK-3β expressed in high Gleason tumors [23].
Furthermore, a study by Liao et al. indicated that Y216GSK3β phosphorylation is elevated in highly aggressive
prostate cancer cells [24]. Nonetheless, inhibition of GSK3 decreases the survival and/or proliferation of many types
of cancer, both in vitro and in vivo [25, 26] demanding
additional research in this area.
It has been previously demonstrated that Src family
kinases (SFKs), which include cSrc, Yes, Fyn, Lyn and Yes
etc. are often de-regulated in multiple cancers, including
prostate cancer, and cause aberrant regulation of many
cellular processes involved in tumor progression and
metastases [27-32]. In the current study, we investigated
if Src is involved in the Y216 phosphorylation and GSK3 activity regulation, and characterized the efficacy of
targeting Src-GSK-3 pathway using pharmacological
inhibitors for prostate cancer therapy. Here, we report that
GSK-3 inhibition decreases cell survival, proliferation,
migration, invasion and micrometastasis of prostate cancer
cells in vitro. We also demonstrate that GSK-3β activation
by Src-mediated Y216 phosphorylation augments prostate

cancer cell function in vitro and tumor xenograft growth
in vivo. Our study also unveils the potential benefits
of dasatinib in the management of prostate cancer by
inhibiting Src-GSK-3β pathway, although further preclinical and clinical validation is desirable.

RESULTS
GSK-3 activity is necessary for prostate cancer
cell tumorigenic and metastatic potential
Literature on the role of GSK-3 in cancer is
controversial. Hence, we first attempted to test the effect
of specific inhibition of GSK-3 activity using SB415286
and SiRNA-mediated GSK-3 knockdown in invasive
human and murine prostate cancer cells. Since motility
and invasion are the hallmarks of invasive and highly
metastatic cancer cells we determined whether GSK-3
activity is necessary for these functions in prostate cancer
cells. Thus, murine metastatic TRAMP (TR-C2N) cells
and human metastatic PC3 cells were examined using
pharmacological (SB415286) and genetic (siRNA-GSK-3)
approach. Our results indicated that direct inhibition of
GSK-3 using inhibitor and SiRNA significantly lowered
the rate of cell migration and invasion (Figure 1A and
B). Optimal dose of GSK-3 inhibitor was determined
by Trypan blue staining based PC3 cell viability assay
at 12 h and a cell migration assay at 12 and 24 h, after
treatment at 0, 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 µM doses of SB415286
(Supplemental Figure 1A and B). Moreover, we also
observed that inhibition of GSK-3 affects tumorigenic
features of prostate cancer cells such as apoptosis,
proliferation, and colony formation. Our study revealed
that both mouse and human metastatic prostate cancer cell
lines exhibited impaired cell survival, proliferation and
colony/foci formation (Figure 2A, B, C). Taken together,
these results indicated that GSK-3 activity is necessary for
prostate cancer cell tumorigenic and invasive properties
in vitro.

Modulation of Src activity correlates with
corresponding changes in GSK-3 Y216
phosphorylation and its activity
It has been shown that Akt has the potential to inhibit
GSK-3 activity via phosphorylation of its Ser9/21 in α
and β isoforms, respectively [33-35]. Although Y216GSK-3
phosphorylation has been linked to its activation [13, 36],
the tyrosine kinase responsible for this phosphorylation
is still under investigation. Since Src over-expression
has been correlated with highly aggressive stages of
prostate cancer [37], we sought to determine if Src
family kinases (SFKs), cSrc in particular is responsible

for Y216 phosphorylation of GSK-3 and its subsequent
activation. Our results indicated that treatment of PC3
cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) significantly
increased phosphorylation of S473Akt, S21/9GSK-3, Y416Src
and Y216GSK-3 in a time-dependent manner (Figure 3AC). We then determined the effect of changes in Akt and
Src activity in the modulation of GSK-3 phosphorylation
in its respective serine and tyrosine residues. Our data
indicated that while Akt activity modulation correlated
with changes in the Ser9/21 of GSK-3, changes in cSrc
activity modulation using specific constitutively active and
catalytically inactive mutants correlated with changes in
the phosphorylation of Y216GSK-3 and Ser33/37/Thr41βcatenin,
a known substrate of GSK-3, thus indicating that Src
is responsible for Y216GSK-3 phosphorylation and its
activation (Figure 4A and B). While over-expression of
PC3 cells with CA-Src increased Y216GSK-3 and Ser33/37/
Thr41
βcatenin phosphorylation, over-expression with DNSrc resulted in reduced Y216GSK-3 and Ser33/37/Thr41βcatenin
phosphorylation. In order to further confirm this result,
we utilized mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in cSrc,
Yes and Fyn isoforms (SYF cells), which has more than
80% of its total SFK phosphorylation reduced. SYF cells

indicated a significant, but not total reduction in Y216GSK-3
and Ser33/37/Thr41βcatenin phosphorylation (Figure 4C and
D). In contrast, reconstituting the SYF cells with CA-Src
resulted in a significant increase in Y216GSK-3 and Ser33/37/
Thr41
βcatenin phosphorylation, once again indicating that
Src is responsible for the tyr216 phosphorylation of GSK3. Interestingly, significant decrease in phosphorylation
level of Y416Src was noticed with over-expression of DNAkt but contrasting effect with over-expression of CAAkt1 was not observed. However, over-expression of DNSrc did not affect phosphorylation status of neither S473Akt
nor S9/21GSK-3 as presented in Figure 4A and B. Together
our results indicated that Src activity is necessary for the
Y216 phosphorylation of GSK-3.

(FDA) for hormone refractory prostate cancer. The
results revealed that dasatinib, but not docetaxel, inhibits
Y216
GSK-3 and Y416Src phosphorylation in a time-dependent
manner. Interestingly, this study also showed that dasatinib
increases S473Akt and S9/21GSK-3 phosphorylation, but
only at the first 3 h of treatment, whereas decreased
phosphorylation of Y216GSK-3 and Y416Src starting from 6 h
in a time-dependent manner (Figure 5A and B). Altogether,
these results indicate that Y216GSK-3 is a downstream
target of activated Src tyrosine kinase.

not statistically significant (Figure 5A). However, both
docetaxel and dasatinib treatments resulted in decreased
PC3 cells proliferation by about 30%, and, interestingly,
an additive effect was noticed when docetaxel and
dasatinib treatment was applied together (Figure 6B).
Similarly to the results from proliferation assay, migration
assay results revealed that both docetaxel and dasatinib
significantly impair cell migration about 50%, with an
additive effect when the drugs used in combination (Figure
6C). Finally, we determined the effect of dasatinib and
docetaxel on micro-metastasis (transendothelial migration)
of PC3 cells. Our experiment indicated that although both
drugs exhibited the potential to inhibit PC3 cell motility
and proliferation, only dasatinib treatment significantly
inhibited micrometastasis (Figure 6D).

docetaxel as therapeutic agents and subjected those to

DISCUSSION

in combination. Our data indicated that monotherapy
with both docetaxel and dasatinib significantly inhibited
prostate tumor growth in vivo by 50-70 % between days
12 and 21 (Fig. 7A and B). Moreover, our data indicated
that treatment with either dasatinib or docetaxel resulted
in significant inhibition of tumor cell proliferation as
evidenced by the reduced Ki67 staining, with dasatinib
showing superior inhibitory effects on PC3 cell
proliferation compared to docetaxel (Figure 7C and D).
To determine the involvement of Src-Y216GSK-3 axis in
the regulation of prostate tumor growth, we subjected the
frozen sections from control, docetaxel and dasatinib PC3
tumor xenografts to western blot analysis. Our analysis
confirmed that levels of c-Src, Y416Src, and Y216GSK-3,
but not S9/21GSK-3 are reduced in dasatinib arm, but not
in docetaxel arm (Figure 7E and F). Collectively, our
study demonstrated the integral role of Src in mediating
Y216
GSK-3 phosphorylation and subsequent activation
leading for prostate cancer growth in vivo.

Recent studies from our laboratory have
demonstrated the integral role of Akt pathway in
prostate cancer [3, 4, 6]. Although Akt is known to
phosphorylate a plethora of substrates, exact functions
of Akt and its various known and yet to be identified
substrates are currently under investigation. Two-gene
family of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3α and
GSK-3β) is one of the less investigated substrates of
Akt for its role in physiology and pathology. Due to the
indispensable role of Akt in cancer and activity inhibiting
GSK-3 phosphorylation by Akt at its Ser21/9 residue,
suppression of GSK-3 activity was assumed to be tumor
promoting. However, recent studies have revealed the
tumor promoting effects of GSK-3 activation in multiple
cancers [12, 26, 38-40]. This suggested the existence of
an alternate mechanism that can sustain GSK-3 activity
in cancer cells despite the inhibitory phosphorylation by
Akt. Here we demonstrate the importance of Src-mediated
phosphorylation of Y216GSK-3 in its activity regulation,

and in mediating multiple prostate cancer cellular function
in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Our data indicated
that inhibition of GSK-3 activity as a result of treatment
with GSK-3 specific inhibitor SB415286 or SiRNAmediated knockdown of GSK-3 in murine TRAMP
(TR-C2N) and human (PC3) invasive prostate cancer
cell lines lead to impaired prostate cancer cell motility,
proliferation, survival, invasion and colony formation in
vitro. While expression of PC3 cells with constitutively
active cSrc (CA-Src) resulted in enhanced Y216GSK-3
phosphorylation, reduced Y216GSK-3 phosphorylation
was observed by expression with kinase dead Src (DNSrc). Analysis of SYF mouse embryonic fibroblasts that
are deficient in cSrc, Yes and Fyn showed that even in
normal cells Src deficiency is correlated with reduced
Y216
GSK-3 phosphorylation. Reconstituting Src activity
by expression with CA-Src in SYF cells significantly
restored Y216GSK-3 phosphorylation, once again indicating
that Y216GSK-3 is a target of Src activity. Treatment of PC3
cells with dasatinib,an inhibitor of SFKs and Bcr/Abl, but
not with docetaxel, resulted in reduced phosphorylation
of Y416Src and Y216GSK-3. Even though treatment with
dasatinib did not significantly induce apoptosis in PC3
cells, this treatment resulted in significant impairment
in cell motility, proliferation and transendothelial
migration (micrometastasis). Furthermore, treatment with
dasatinib resulted in decreased Y416Src and Y216GSK-3
phosphorylation, reduced rate of cell proliferation and
growth of PC3 tumor xenograft in an athymic nude mouse
model. Together, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of
GSK-3 activity regulation in normal and cancer cells with
its specific role in prostate cancer progression.
Historically, changes in GSK-3 activity has been
investigated based on the changes in phosphorylation of
Ser21 and Ser9 of GSK-3α and GSK-3β, respectively
by Akt [10] and to a lesser extent by a few other kinases
such as casein kinase-2 [41], protein kinase [42] and
protein kinase C [43]. While p38 MAP kinase has been
indicated in the negative regulation of GSK-3β activity
via phosphorylation of Ser389 and Thr390 [44], ERK has
been shown to inhibit GSK-3β activity by phosphorylation
of Thr43 [45]. Conversely, GSK-3 is activated by
phosphorylation of Tyr216 in GSK-3β and Tyr-279 in
GSK-3α present in its “T-Loop” found within subdomain
VIII [13-15]. But the mechanism regulating GSK-3
tyrosine phosphorylation is not yet fully characterized and
appears to be cell type and context dependent. While a
number of candidates such as ZAK1 [46], Fyn [47], and
Pyk2 [48, 49] have been reported to be responsible for
Y216
GSK-3 phosphorylation in various cell types, scientists
also debate the possibility of GSK-3β un-phosphorylated
at its Ser9 can act as a tyrosine kinase, auto-phosphorylate
its Y216 residue and then transform into a serine-threonine
kinase [14, 50].
Crystal structure study has shown that Y216GSK3β phosphorylation induces conformational changes in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the kinase enhancing its interaction with the substrate,
and GSK-3β un-phosphorylated at Y216 does not
interact with its substrate [51]. Many studies indicate
that over-expression of cells with plasmids encoding
GSK-3β S9A mutant, which is currently considered as
constitutively active GSK-3, leads to hyper-activation
of the GSK-3 signaling pathway [52, 53]. Hence, in a
scenario where GSK-3 Y216 phosphorylation has to be
considered as an autophosphorylated event, it appears that
dephosphorylation of its Ser9 is a pre-requisite. While
autophosphorylation by GSK-3 at its Y216 residue cannot
be ruled out in certain conditions, at least in cancer cells,
where kinases such as Akt and PKC are hyper-activated,
sustaining GSK-3 activity can happen only with the
existence of an alternate pathway, potentially involving a
non-receptor tyrosine kinase.
Although deregulation of PI3 Kinase-Akt pathway
as a result of PTEN mutation is one of the major cause
for prostate cancer [1, 54, 55], enhanced expression and
activity as well as changes in intracellular localization
of both GSK-3α and GSK-3β have also been correlated
with the Gleason score of the prostate cancer patients [23],
once again suggesting that an Akt-independent pathway
does exist in prostate cancer cells in the regulation of
GSK-3 activity. In addition to Akt and GSK-3, Src is
an additional kinase that has been implicated in prostate
cancer [56-58]. Our data indicate that modulation of Src
activity using constitutively active and kinase-dead Src
plasmids in prostate cancer cells results in the modulation
of Y216GSK-3β phosphorylation. Reduced phosphorylation
of Y216GSK-3β phosphorylation was also observed in SYF
fibroblasts indicating that even in fibroblasts, where Src
is essential for wound healing and modulation of fibrotic
events [59], GSK-3 activity can be modulated by Src
kinases. Furthermore, treatment of prostate cancer cells
with dasatinib, a Src and Bcr-Abl inhibitor, but not with
docetaxel, resulted in reduced Y216GSK-3β phosphorylation
as well as impaired cellular function in vitro and tumor
growth in vivo. Together, our study for the first time,
demonstrated the existence of a Src-mediated Y216GSK-3β
phosphorylation and activation leading to prostate cancer
cell motility, proliferation, micrometastasis and tumor
progression. Most importantly, information obtained
from our study could be useful in the development of
novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of early and
castration resistant prostate cancer.

In vitro and In vivo proliferation assay:

embryonic fibroblasts deficient in Src, Yes and Fyn) were
maintained in DMEM (HyClone, Thermo Scientific,
Logan, UT) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/
ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2
atmosphere at 37°C. Primary antibodies against phosphoAktSer473, phospho-GSK-3α/βSer9/21, phospho-SrcTyr416,
phospho-βcateninSer33/37/Thr41, pan-Akt and siRNA for GSK3α/β were purchased from Cell Signaling (Boston, MA).
Phospho-GSK-3Tyr216 was obtained from BD Biosciences
(Franklin Lakes, NJ). Primary antibodies against β-actin
and GSK-3 inhibitor (SB415286) were purchased from
Sigma, St. Louis, MO. All secondary antibodies were
obtained from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). EGF was obtained
from R&D (Minneapolis, MN). Docetaxel was purchased
from Sigma, St. Louis, MO and Dasatinib was purchased
from Santacruz biotechnology, (Dallas, TX).

Proliferation assay was carried out in vitro and in
vivo as previously described [5]. Briefly, proliferation
assay in vitro was determined using the nonradioactive
BrDU-based cell proliferation assay (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, TRAMP (TR-C2N) and PC3 cells were seeded in
96-well plates at a density of 5x103cells per well. After 24
h, TRAMP cells were treated with 50 nM EGF plus 20 μM
of SB415286 for 12 and 24 h. Control cells received only
50 nM EGF. PC3 cells were transiently transfected with
SiGSK-3 and scrambled SiRNA (control), respectively,
or received followed treatment: docetaxel (25 nM) and
dasatinib (50 nM) or a combination of docetaxel (25 nM)
with dasatinib (50 nM). Next, cells were subjected to a
5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine assay using the BrDU Labeling
and Detection Kit III (RocheApplied Science), according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. BrDU incorporation into
the DNA was determined by measuring the absorbance at
both 450 and 690 nm on ELISA plate reader. Proliferation
assay in vivo was performed using immunofluorescence
staining of the tumor sections for Ki67 antigen as a marker
of proliferating cells performed according to the protocol
of the manufacturer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Briefly,
formalin-fixed, frozen prostate (PC3) xenograft tumor
sections from nude mice were subjected to the standard
xyline ethanol dehydration process and permeabilized
with 0.3% Triton X-100 in 1 X PBS. The nonspecific
staining was blocked with 5% goat serum for 1 h at room
temperature. The dehydrated, permeabilized, and blocked
tissue sections were incubated with primary antibody
against Ki67 antigen (dilution 1:1000) overnight at 4
°C, followed by washing with 1 X PBS (4 times for 15
min each). Next, anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488-labeled
secondary antibodies (1:500) were applied for 1 h at room
temperature and washed four times for 15 min with 1 X
PBS. The slides were mounted with Vectashield (Vector
Laboratories), and thei mages were taken by a Zeiss
fluorescent microscope (ZeissAxiovert100M, Carl Zeiss).
The data are presented as mean ± SD (n=4).

Transfections:
Human PC3 cells were transiently transfected with
either SiRNA-GSK-3 (Santacruz biotechnology, Dallas,
TX) using oligofectamine (Life technologies, Carlsbad,
CA) or cSrc constructs for CA-Src (Y527F) and DNSrc (K259R), and Akt constructs for CA-Akt (myrAkt) and DN-Akt (Akt-K179M) using lipofectamine
2000 (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA) as transfection
reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol. SYF
cells were transiently transfected with CA-Src construct
using lipofectamine 2000. Control cells were transfected
with either scrambled SiRNA or empty vector pBabepuromycin. Approximately 75–85% transfection efficiency
was obtained.

In vitro apoptosis assay:
Apoptosis assay was performed as previously
described [5] and determined based on cytoplasmic
histone-associated DNA fragments detection, quantified
by the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Applied
Science, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, TRAMP (TR-C2N) and PC3 cells were
plated in 96-well plate at a density of 104 cells/
well. After 24h, TRAMP cells were treated with 50 nM
EGF plus 20 μM of SB415286 for 12 and 24 h. Control
cells received only 50 nM EGF. PC3 cells were transiently
transfected with SiGSK-3 and scrambled SiRNA (control),
or received treatment as follows: docetaxel (25 nM) and
dasatinib (50 nM) or a combination of docetaxel (25
nM) with dasatinib (50 nM). Next, cells were lysed
and centrifuged at 200g for 10 min, and the collected
supernatant was subjected to apoptosis detection ELISA
plate. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm (reference
wavelength, 492 nm). The data are presented as mean ±
SD (n=4).

Colony formation assay:
Colony formation assay was performed using
standardized protocol in the lab [3]. In this approach,
TRAMP cells (TR-C2N) and PC3 cells were cultured on
6-well plates. After 24 h, TRAMP cells were treated with
50 nM EGF plus 20 μM of SB415286 for 16 h. Control
cells received only 50 nM EGF. PC3 cells were transient
transfected with siRNA-GSK-3 whereas control cell were
transient transfected with scrambled siRNA. 5 days later,
each of the wells was fixed using methanol and stained
by crystal violet. Next, cells were counted using Image J
software for the number of colonies which were compared

in PBS, pH 7.4) to avoid integrin/receptor loss due to
trypsin digestion. Real-time measurements on the transendothelial migration of PC3 cells were recorded by the
ECIS instrument up to 12 h and changes in the initial 5 h
was analyzed.

Migration assay:
Migration assay was performed as previously
described [6]. Briefly, TRAMP cells (TR-C2N) were plated
in 12-well plates and after reaching monolayer treated
with either 50 nM EGF plus 20 μM of SB415286. Control
cells received only 50 nM EGF. PC3 cells were transient
transiently transfected with SiGSK-3 and scrambled
SiRNA (control) or received followed treatment:
docetaxel (25 nM), dasatinib (50 nM) or a combination
of docetaxel (25 nM) with dasatinib (50 nM). Next, cells
were grown on plates to reach confluence (approximately
16 h). A scratch was made in the monolayer and pictures
were taken at 0, 12 h and 24 h. The rate of migration (as
measured by scratch recovery) was calculated using the
following equation (1-Tt/T0) X 100, were t = 12 h or 24 h.
The data are presented as mean ± SD (n=4).

Drug formulation and in vivo administration:
Docetaxel and dasatinb were dissolved in 80
mmol/L citrate buffer (pH=3.1) according to the
manufacture’s instruction to a concentration of 20 mg/ml.
For injections, PC3 cells were grown to confluence in 250ml flasks. Next, cells were re-suspended in sterile saline
to a concentration of 2.0 106/ml. Cell suspension (100 µl)
was injected subcutaneously into 8-week-old nude mice
(athymic nude mice; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN). Four days
after xenograft injection, mice were randomized to receive
drug or control vehicle (6 mice per group). The controls
animals were injected intra-peritoneally with 100 µl of
sterile saline, whereas treatment animals received followed
equal volume treatment of docetaxel (5 mg/kg) and
dasatinib (10 mg/kg), respectively, or in combination of
docetaxel (5 mg/kg) and dasatinib (10 mg/kg). Docetaxel
was administrated for 3 days per week for 2 weeks total,
whereas dasatinib was administrated 5 days per week for
3 weeks total. Mice were sacrificed on day 21 and tumors
were dissected, weighed, and snap-frozen using dry ice
for further processing to use in Western blot analysis
and immunohistochemistry. All animal procedures were
performed according to the protocol approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Invasion assay:
The invasion assay was performed as previously
described [4] using BD BioCoat Tumor Invasion Kit (BD
Biosciences) coated with BD Matrigel Matrix according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, TRAMP (TR-C2N)
and PC3 cells transiently transfected with either scrambled
SiRNA or SiGSK-3 were labeled for 30 min with BD
DilC12 fluorescence dye and seeded onto the upper
chamber of 96-well Transwell plate at a density of 1x104
cells per well in 400 μl serum free medium. Serum free
medium was then added to the lower chamber of TRAMP
cells and supplemented with 50 nM EGF plus 20 μM of
SB415286. Control cells were treated with only 50 nM
EGF. Serum free medium added to the lower chamber of
PC3 cells as well and then supplemented only with 50 nM
EGF. The absorbance of the stained cells was measured
after 12 and 24 h on an ELISA plate reader. The data are
presented as mean ± SD (n=4).

Western blot analysis:
Whole cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer
[50 mM Tris-HCl (pH=7.4), 1% TritonX-100, 150mM
NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 2mM Na3VO4, and 1X Complete
protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis,
IN)]. The protein concentration was measured by the Dc
protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Western analyses
were performed using standard Laemmle’s method as
done previously [3]. Densitometry was done using NIH
Image J software.

Micro-metastasis assay:
Trans-endothelial migration of prostate cancer
(TRAMP and PC3) cell lines was measured using Electric
Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) equipment with
human dermal microvascular endothelial (TIME) cells
(ATCC, Manassas, VA) plated on 8W10E+ array chips
(Applied Biophysics, Troy, NY) as previously described
[6]. Following this, PC3 were treated with docetaxel (25
nM), dasatinib (50 nM) or a combination of docetaxel (25
nM) with dasatinib (50 nM). Next, cells were directly
added onto endothelial cell monolayer at a density of
5x104 cells per well in 50 μl medium. Cells were detached
from plate by using cell dissociation buffer (20 mM EDTA

Statistical Analysis:
All the data are presented as means ± SD (n = 3 to
6). To determine significant differences between treatment
and control values, we used the Student’s two-tailed t
test. The significance was set at 0.05 levels (marked with
symbols wherever data are statistically significant).
