Abstract
Amplification and overexpression of erbB2 (Her-2/neu) protooncogene has been linked to human malignancies including
tumors of the breast, ovary, and stomach. It has been
implicated in tumor growth, sensitivity to standard chemotherapy, prognosis of patients, and disease-free survival.
Although the clinical use of trastuzumab (Herceptin) has
prolonged the survival of breast cancer patients with erbB2overexpressing tumors, there is an urgent need for more
potent and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitors. CP724,714 is a potent inhibitor of erbB2 receptor autophosphorylation in intact cells and is currently undergoing phase I
clinical trials. Here, we describe the effects of CP-724,714
in vitro and in vivo in human breast cancer models. CP724,714 is selective for inhibiting growth of HER2-driven cell
lines. In addition, we show that it induces G1 cell cycle block in
erbB2-overexpressing BT-474 human breast carcinoma cells
and inhibits erbB2 autophosphorylation in xenografts when
administered p.o. to athymic mice. It induces a marked
reduction of extracellular signal–regulated kinase and Akt
phosphorylation, tumor cell apoptosis, and release of caspase3. P.o. administration (q.d. or b.i.d.) of CP-724,714 inhibits the
growth of erbB2-overexpressing tumors in athymic mice
without overt adverse effects. [Cancer Res 2007;67(20):9887–93]

Introduction
The human epidermal growth factor 2 (erbB2/Her-2/neu) is a
member of the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor
(EGFR) family that also includes erbB1 (EGFR, Her-1), erbB3
(Her-3), and erbB4 (Her-4). Signaling of this type I family of
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), erbB1 and erbB2 in particular, is
crucial for mediating the survival, proliferation, and differentiation
of normal cells (1–5). Amplification and overexpression of erbB2
have frequently been observed in human malignancies, and it has
been implicated in oncogenic transformation and tumorigenesis.
These observations have triggered extensive efforts to find
compounds that can prevent/disrupt erbB2 receptor–mediated
growth signaling and prevent tumor growth. Several strategies have
been developed to prevent erbB2 activation, such as humanized

antibody, which can bind to p185erbB2 and prevent receptormediated signal transduction and small-molecule inhibitors that
block the ATP-binding sites of the cytosolic domain of the erbB2
receptor.
Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody
directed against p185erbB2 (6–9), was the first agent targeting
these receptors approved for clinical use, and was shown to
significantly improve the quality and overall life expectancy of
erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer patients (10, 11). Unfortunately,
a significant number of patients with tumors overexpressing erbB2
do not respond to trastuzumab (12), and most who respond
eventually develop resistance to therapy (13).
An alternative strategy is to discover low molecular weight
agents that can be administered p.o. In the EGFR family receptors,
gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva), which target the erbB1
receptor, have already been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA; refs. 14–16). In addition, several reversible
small-molecule inhibitors of EGFR (15–18), a dual inhibitor of
EGFR and erbB2 (GW2016, lapatanib; see refs. 18–20), and
irreversible pan-erbB receptor inhibitors like canertinib (CI-1033;
ref. 21) are in various phases of clinical trials.
Inhibition of EGFR is frequently associated with dose-limiting
side effects. For example, acne-like skin rash on the face and upper
torso was observed in 86% of patients treated with cetuximab (22).
Similarly, adverse acneiform skin rash has also been observed
during clinical trials with the small-molecule EGFR inhibitors
gefitinib (23, 24) and erlotinib (25), the pan-erbB inhibitor
canertinib (26), and the dual kinase inhibitor lapatinib. These
observations indicate that a potent and erbB2-selective agent
might not cause this adverse reaction, and this logic led us to start a
program seeking a small-molecule erbB2-selective inhibitor, which
led to the discovery of CP-724,714.
ErbB2-selective agents represent a unique class of inhibitors
potentially devoid of clinical dose-limiting side effects associated
with EGFR inhibition such as skin toxicity. We recently reported
the biological and biochemical attributes including the antiproliferative effect of a prototype erbB2-selective agent, CP-654,577 (27).
We describe herein the pharmacology and biological effects of
CP-724,714, a potent erbB2-selective inhibitor.

Cells and cell proliferation assays. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transfected
with chimeric EGFR/erbB2 or human EGFR have previously been reported
(27, 29). FRE-erbB2 cells were generated by transfection of Fischer rat
embryo fibroblasts with human erbB2 containing an activating mutation in
the transmembrane domain as previously reported (27). FRE-erbB2 cells
were grown in DMEM with high glucose, 1.5 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 10%

fetal bovine serum (FBS; ref. 27). The effects of CP-724,714 on cell
proliferation were studied in human breast cancer cell lines growing
in vitro. The cell lines ZR-75-30, HCC-1419, MDA-MB-175, BT-474, SKBR3,
MDA-MB-361, UACC-812, T-47D, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468, CAMA-1,
MDA-MB-157, MCF-7, MDA-MB-435, ZR-75-1, BT-20, and MDA-MB-231
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines
EFM-192A, KPL-1, EFM-19, and CAL-51 were obtained from the German
Tissue Repository Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und
Zellkulturen (DSMZ), and the cell lines SUM-190 and SUM-225 were
obtained from the University of Michigan. MDA-MB-175, UACC-893,
UACC-812, and MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured in L15 medium
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mmol/L glutamine, and
1% penicillin G-streptomycin-fungizone solution (PSF; Irvine Scientific).
CAL-51 and KPL-1 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated FBS and PSF, as above. SUM-190 and SUM-225 cells were
cultured in Ham’s F-12 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, PSF,
5 mg/mL insulin, and 1 mg/mL hydrocortisone. The remaining cell lines
were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS,
2 mmol/L glutamine, and PSF.
Cells were seeded in duplicate at 5,000 to 10,000 per well in 24-well plates.
The day after plating, CP-724,714 was added by titrating over six or more
dilutions from 10 Amol/L down. Control wells without drug were seeded as
well. Cells were grown for 6 to 7 days, at which time surviving cells were
counted. After trypsinization, cells were placed in isotone solution and
counted immediately using a Coulter Z2 particle counter (Beckman Coulter,
Inc.). Growth inhibition was calculated [(1 experimental value / control
value)  100] for each concentration. Dose-response curves were repeated at
least twice and averaged. IC50 values were calculated using Calcusyn
Software (Biosoft).
Animals. Athymic female mice (CD-1 nu/nu, f20 g) obtained from
Charles River Laboratories were used for all of the in vivo studies. Mice were
housed in specific pathogen-free conditions according to the guidelines of
the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care (30) and all of the in vivo studies were carried out under approved
institutional experimental animal care and use protocols. Animal handling
was done in a laminar flow hood. Animals were provided pelleted food and
water ad libitum and kept in a room conditioned at 70jF to 75jF with 50%
to 60% relative humidity. Sentinel mice were monitored at regular intervals
by serologic assays and were found free of murine pathogens (murine
hepatitis virus, Sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, minute virus of
mice, mouse poliovirus type 3 reovirus, Mycoplasma pulmonis, mouse parvovirus, epizootic diarrhea of infant mice, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus,
mouse adenovirus, ectromelia, mouse pneumonitis, and polyomavirus). For
all of the studies, mice were allowed to acclimate a minimum of 3 days after
receipt of shipment and randomized before commencement of studies.
Kinase assays. The erbB2 and EGFR kinase reactions were done as
previously reported (27).
Cell selectivity assay. NIH 3T3 cells transfected with chimeric EGFR/
erbB2 or EGFR were used to determine the erbB2 selectivity of CP-724,714.
Cells were treated with CP-724,714 or erlotinib (EGFR inhibitor) for 2 h and
then stimulated with EGF for 10 min. Cell lysates were used for Western blot
analysis (27).
Cell cycle analysis. Exponentially growing BT-474 cells were treated
with CP-724,714 (1 Amol/L, 24 h) and cell cycle distribution was determined
by flow cytometric analysis as described earlier (27).
Colony formation assays. BT-474 or SKBR3 cells were seeded at 3,000 or
1,000 per plate, respectively, in medium supplemented with 10% FBS. After
attachment overnight, compound was added and cells were exposed for 6
days followed by replacement of medium without compound. On day 14
after seeding, the medium was removed by aspiration and the plates were
rinsed with normal saline and fixed with methanolic crystal violet. Colonies
were counted manually.
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. FRE-erbB2 cells
(5  105 per mouse) were inoculated s.c. into the flank region of female
athymic mice and allowed to grow to f250 mm3. Animals were treated
with vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) or CP-724,714 (25 mg/kg, p.o.) and
tumors and plasma were isolated at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h after dosing.

ErbB2 Kinase Inhibitor
Ex vivo studies. FRE-erbB2 xenograft–bearing mice were treated with
vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) or CP-724,714 (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and
100 mg/kg, p.o., in 0.5% methylcellulose) and tumors and plasma were
isolated at 1 h after dosing. Tumors were homogenized in ice-cold lysis
buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2,
1 mmol/L EDTA,1% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.6 mmol/L Na3VO4,
50 mmol/L NaF, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Boehringer Mannheim)] at
1 mL buffer/100 mg of tumor wet weight. ErbB2 phosphorylation status was
determined using a neu-coated ELISA plate (Oncogene Research Products)
to capture the receptor and the plate is probed with a horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99). Inhibition of
erbB2 phosphorylation was measured as the decrease of ELISA signal
relative to the vehicle-treated control tumors (27).
In vivo efficacy of CP-724,714. These studies were conducted to
establish whether CP-724,714 could inhibit xenograft growth in vivo.
Exponentially growing cells were trypsinized and resuspended in sterile
PBS and inoculated s.c. [FRE-erbB2 cells at 0.5  106 per mouse and human
tumor cells (BT-474 and MDA-MB-453) at 5  106 to 10  106 per mouse in

200 mL] into the right flank of female athymic mice (27). Animals bearing
xenografts were randomly divided into groups (7–10 per group) and treated
with either vehicle or CP-724,714 formulated in 0.5% methylcellulose. Animal
body weight and tumor measurements (in millimeters) were obtained every
2 to 4 days. Tumor volume (in cubic millimeters) was calculated using the
formula length (mm)  width (mm)  width (mm)  0.5, as previously
described (27). Tumors were isolated and homogenized in ice-cold lysis
buffer. ErbB2 receptor phosphorylation was determined by ELISA as
described earlier.
In vivo induction of apoptosis. Mice bearing FRE-erbB2 xenografts
(f150 mm3 in size) were treated with vehicle or CP-724,714 (30 and
100 mg/kg, p.o., in 0.5% methylcellulose). Tumors were isolated (0.5, 1, 2, 4,
and 8 h after dosing) from five mice per dose at each time point and fixed in
formaldehyde. The tumors were processed routinely into paraffin, sectioned
at 5 Am, and stained with H&E. Apoptotic cells were counted in 10 randomized 400 fields (Olympus BX51) of each section of the tumor. Apoptotic
cells were also evaluated by immunostaining of tumor sections for cleaved
caspase-3 using an avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique (Cell Signaling).

Figure 2. A, selective inhibition of erbB2 kinase by CP-724,714. NIH 3T3 cells transfected with chimeric EGFR/erbB2 (top ) or human EGFR (bottom ) were treated
with the indicated concentrations of the compound for 2 h and then stimulated for 10 min with 50 ng/mL EGF. Lysates were prepared and analyzed for tyrosine
phosphorylation of the chimeric receptor (top ) or EGFR (bottom ) as described (27). Triplicate samples were analyzed. The blotting membranes were cut at a
midrange molecular weight and the lower molecular weight region was blotted for actin to confirm equal loading. B, receptor autophosphorylation was evaluated as
described in A. The Western blot with phosphospecific antibodies was quantitated by use of a Lumi-Imager and were reported as relative levels to the control
autophosphorylation in samples treated for 10 min with EGF, normalized to 100%. The values are mean F SD for n = 3 for cells treated with inhibitor and n = 6
for the controls. C, CP-724,714 induces a G1 cell cycle block. BT-474 cells in culture were treated for 24 h with 1 Amol/L CP-724,714 (B) or vehicle for control (A),
and then analyzed for DNA synthesis and DNA content by flow cytometry. D, CP-724,714 reduces colony formation by erbB2-overexpressing cells. Colony formation by
BT-474 and SKBR3 cells in the presence of vehicle (control) or the indicated concentration of CP-724,714 was evaluated as described in Materials and Methods.

performance of the assay was monitored by inclusion of quality control
samples prepared in mouse whole blood from a separate weighing.

Figure 3. CP-724,714 produces a reduction of erbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation
in FRE-erbB2 xenografts. FRE-erbB2 cells (5  105 per mouse) were
inoculated s.c. and mice bearing FRE-erbB2 xenografts (f250 mm3 in size)
were used for all studies. Tumors were isolated at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h after
CP-724,714 administration (25 mg/kg, p.o.; A ). o, plasma concentration of
CP-724,714; ., reduction of erbB2 receptor phosphorylation. To determine
EC50, FRE-erbB2 xenograft–bearing mice were treated with CP-724,714 (3.125,
6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, p.o., in 0.5% methylcellulose) and tumors
were isolated at 1 h (B ). Tumors were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer
and erbB2 phosphorylation status was determined.

Blood and plasma analysis of CP-724,714. Aliquots (50 AL) of whole
blood or plasma, diluted with 50-AL acetonitrile (25%) containing an
internal standard (0.5 Ag/mL), were subsequently extracted with methyltert-butyl ether and 0.1 mol/L sodium hydroxide by 96-well liquid-liquid
extraction. Concentrations of CP-724,714 and internal standard were
determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with a
Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. CP-724,714 and
internal standard were separated chromatographically using a reversephase analytical column (50  2.1 mm; 5-Am particle, Waters XTerra MS C18
5 Am) at a flow rate of 250 AL/min at ambient temperature. The mobile
phase was delivered as 90% 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate with 0.1%
formic acid and 10% acetonitrile for the first minute followed by a linear
gradient from 10% to 90% acetonitrile over 1 min. Then the mobile phase
was delivered isocratically at 90% acetonitrile for 1 min before a subsequent
gradient back to 10% acetonitrile over 0.1 min. The column was allowed to
reequilibrate at 90% 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate with 0.1% formic acid
and 10% acetonitrile for 1.0 min before the next sample injection.
CP-724,714 and internal standard were analyzed by a turbo ion-spray
interface operating in positive ion mode by multiple reactions monitoring
with m/z transitions being 470.3!381.2 and 454.2!383.1 atomic mass
units, respectively. The retention times of CP-724,714 and internal standard
were f2.54 and 2.62 min, respectively. Data collection and integration were
accomplished using MacQuan (version 1.6). The ratio of peak area
responses of the drug relative to internal standard was used to construct
a standard curve using a linear least squares regression with a 1/x

In vitro inhibition of erbB2 kinase and selectivity assays.
CP-724,714 (Fig. 1A) was evaluated as an inhibitor of erbB2 and
EGFR kinases in an assay of poly-GluTyr phosphorylation by
recombinant intracellular domains of the respective kinases as
previously described (27). It was determined to be a potent
inhibitor of erbB2 kinase (IC50 10 F 3 nmol/L) with a marked
selectivity against EGFR kinase (IC50 6,400 F 2,100 nmol/L; Fig. 1B).
Furthermore, CP-724,714 was >1,000-fold less potent for insulin
receptor, insulin-like growth factor-I receptor, platelet-derived
growth factor h, vascular endothelial growth factor 2, Abl, Src,
c-Met, c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-2, JNK-3, ZAP-70, cyclindependent kinase (Cdk)-2, and Cdk-5 in in vitro kinase assays (data
not shown).
The selectivity and potency of CP-724,714 for inhibition of
erbB2 and EGFR kinases were further evaluated in studies with
NIH 3T3 cells transfected either with human EGFR or with a
chimera consisting of EGFR extracellular domain and erbB2
intracellular domain as previously described (27). CP-724,714
potently reduced the EGF-induced autophosphorylation of the
chimera containing the erbB2 kinase domain at a concentration
as low as 50 nmol/L (IC50 32 nmol/L) but was markedly less
potent against EGFR (Fig. 2A and B). In contrast, as previously
reported, the EGFR-selective inhibitor erlotinib was more potent
against the EGFR than the chimera (27). The onset of inhibition
of erbB2 autophosphorylation was very rapid, reached maximal
within 10 min, and was rapidly reversed on washout (data not
shown).
Antiproliferative effects. The antiproliferative effects of CP724,714 in vitro across a panel of human breast cancer cell lines
with variable levels of erbB2 and EGFR are shown in Fig. 1C. There
is a significant relationship between sensitivity to CP-724,714 and
erbB2 amplification (P = 0.000056, Pearson m2). BT-474 and SKBR3
were selected for further study as representative cell lines that are
sensitive to CP-724,714 and are erbB2 amplified.
In vitro cell cycle inhibition by CP-724,714. Treatment of the
Her2-amplified BT-474 breast cancer cells, which overexpress erbB2,
with 1 Amol/L CP-724,714 for 24 h resulted in accumulation of cells
in G1 phase and a marked reduction in S-phase cells (Fig. 2C) as
measured by flow cytometry. The S-phase fraction decreased from a
control level (untreated) of 26 F 3% (mean F SD) to 3.2 F 0.2% and
the G1 fraction increased from 59 F 5% to 83 F 0.2%. Thus, the
inhibition of erbB2 in these cells resulted in a G1 block of
BT-474 cell cycle progression. Exposure of BT-474 or SKBR3 cells
to CP-724,714 also led to cell death as indicated by a decrease in
colony formation (Fig. 2D). Colony formation was reduced by
>80% at 1 Amol/L (BT-474) and 3 Amol/L (SKBR3). CP-724,714 at
1 Amol/L also reduced the level of phospho-erbB2 in these cells
by >90% at 24 h of exposure as measured by Western blotting with
a specific anti–phospho-erbB2 antibody (data not shown).
In vivo reduction of erbB2 receptor phosphorylation by CP724,714. We next examined the effect of CP-724,714 on erbB2
receptor phosphorylation in athymic mice bearing FRE-erbB2
xenografts as described in Materials and Methods. CP-724,714
(25 mg/kg) was rapidly absorbed after p.o. administration and
caused f75% reduction of tumor erbB2 receptor phosphorylation
at 30 min after dosing with a plasma concentration of f12.5 Ag/mL

(Fig. 3A). The reduction of erbB2 receptor phosphorylation was
correlated with the plasma concentration of CP-724,714 and a
complete recovery of this reduction was achieved within 4 h. Studies
were also conducted to establish a relationship between the concentration of CP-724,714 and the reduction of erbB2 phosphorylation in the FRE-erbB2 model (Fig. 3B). P.o. administration of
CP-724,714 resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction of
erbB2 receptor phosphorylation (EC50 1 Ag/mL). Similarly, CP724,714 treatments (p.o.) in the BT-474 model showed marked
reduction of erbB2 receptor phosphorylation with a comparable
EC50 value (0.77 Ag/mL; data not shown).
Tumor cell apoptosis. Athymic, female FRE-erbB2 xenograft–
bearing mice (f150 mm3 in size, s.c.) treated with a single dose of
vehicle or CP-724,714 (30 or 100 mg/kg, p.o.) were sacrificed at the
indicated times and tumors were isolated and processed for
quantitative microscopic evaluation of apoptosis. Apoptotic cells
were counted in 10 random 400 fields of each section of the
tumor. CP-724,714 treatments resulted in a time- and dosedependent induction of apoptosis, which was evident as early as 4
to 8 h after dosing. Approximately 75% more tumor cells exhibited
apoptotic changes in the 100 mg/kg treatment group compared
with vehicle control group at 8 h after dosing (Fig. 4A). An
increased number of cleaved caspase-3 immunostained cells in
tumors of this group was also observed by immunohistochemical
analysis (Fig. 4B).
Inhibition of FRE-erbB2 xenograft growth by CP-724,714. We
extended our investigations to determine the antitumor efficacy of
CP-724,714 in FRE-erbB2 tumor model. Athymic female mice
bearing FRE-erbB2 xenografts (f150 mm3 in size, s.c.) were
randomized in groups consisting of nine animals each as described
in Materials and Methods. P.o. administration of CP-724,714 (6.25–
100 mg/kg, q.d.) resulted in an inhibition of FRE-erbB2 xenografts
(Fig. 5A). Approximately 50% tumor growth inhibition was observed

in animals receiving daily doses of 50 mg/kg, q.d. (P < 0.001). The
plasma C max and C ave 0–4 h values in this group were 4.5 and
1.3 Ag/mL, respectively. CP-724,714 was well tolerated and there
was no weight loss or mortality.
Inhibition of human breast cancer xenografts by CP724,714. We evaluated the p.o. antitumor efficacy of CP-724,714
in two human breast carcinoma models, BT-474 and MDA-MB-453,
which are Her2 amplified and highly overexpress erbB2 (confirmed
by flow cytometry; data not shown). CP-724,714 produced a dosedependent inhibition of BT-474 xenograft growth with antiproliferative efficacy observed within 4 days of dosing at the two higher
doses (Fig. 5B). BT-474 xenograft growth at 30 mg/kg ceased after
14 days of dosing and there was no tumor regrowth until day 40
when the study was terminated. Overall, on day 40, the tumor
growth inhibition was 41%, 42%, 81%, and 100% (relative to vehicle)
in 1, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg treatment groups, respectively. Tumor
regression occurred in the 100 mg/kg treatment group by day 9
(f6%), and it reached 61% regression on day 40 (P < 0.001). On day
40, the reduction of tumor erbB2 receptor phosphorylation was
nonlinear (10–30% in 1–30 mg/kg treatment groups); however,
81% reduction of erbB2 receptor phosphorylation was observed in
the 100 mg/kg group. The antitumor efficacy of CP-724,714 was also
determined in the MDA-MB-453 xenograft model, which also
expresses a higher level of erbB2. On day 29, f19%, 66%, and 83%
tumor growth inhibition was achieved in the 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg
b.i.d. treatment groups, respectively (Fig. 5C). The reduction of
tumor erbB2 phosphorylation in these groups was in the range of
69% to 79%.
The antitumor efficacy of CP-724,714 was also determined in
athymic mice bearing xenografts expressing lower levels of erbB2,
specifically MDA-MB-231 (breast), LoVo (colon), and Colo-205
(colon). CP-724,714 treatments were efficacious in all these
models; however, the growth inhibition obtained in these models

levels because it plays an important role in transducing cell survival
signaling through erbB2 RTK. Administration of CP-724,714
markedly reduced phospho-Akt within 0.5 h (Fig. 6A and B).
Approximately 42% and 70% reductions of phospho-Akt in
BT-474 xenograft was observed at 0.5 h with 30 and 100 mg/kg
treatments, respectively.

Discussion
In summary, overexpression or amplification of erbB RTK in
human cancers has provided a rationale for targeting these
receptors for the discovery of novel target-based therapeutics.
Recent FDA approvals of the EGFR-targeted small-molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib, the dual EGFR/
erbB2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib, and the monoclonal
antibody cetuximab have significantly improved the quality of
life and overall survival of cancer patients with EGFR and

Figure 5. Effect of CP-724,714 on the growth of tumor xenografts. Exponentially
growing cancer cells were harvested and inoculated s.c. into the flank of
female athymic mice as described in Materials and Methods. Animals bearing
xenografts (85–150 mm3 in size) were treated with vehicle or CP-724,714
in 0.5% methylcellulose [p.o., q.d. (FRE-erbB2, A) or b.i.d. (BT-474, B and
MDA-MB-453, C)] for 8 to 40 d. The tumors were measured with a caliper
and tumor volume (mm3) was calculated. Points, mean; bars, SE. P.o.
administration of CP-724,714 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor
growth. No weight loss or mortality of the animals was noted in any group.

on 100 mg/kg (p.o.) b.i.d. dosing for 14 to 31 days of treatment
was in the range of 46% to 71% (detailed data not shown). Thus,
response in these models was less than that seen in the very high
erbB2 expressing tumors MDA-MB-453 and BT-474 in which 83%
inhibition of growth or regressions were obtained (Fig. 5).
Reduction of extracellular signal–regulated kinase and Akt
phosphorylation. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)
extracellular signal–regulated kinase Erk1 and Erk2 play critical
roles in cell growth and survival. CP-724,714 treatments (30 or
100 mg/kg, p.o.) resulted in f75% reduction of these activated
(phosphorylated) MAPKs in BT-474 xenografts (Fig. 6A and B). We
also determined the effect of CP-724,714 on tumor phospho-Akt

HER2-dependent malignancies (14, 31, 32–34). Similarly, the survival
benefit of trastuzumab treatments in combination with paclitaxel
in breast cancer patients (8, 9) has brought higher expectations and
enthusiasm for the discovery of new agents targeting the signal
transduction pathway of the EGFR family.
Although the successful clinical outcome of trastuzumab treatments validates the benefit of targeting the erbB2 RTK signaling
pathway, long-term use of trastuzumab has several limitations.
Trastuzumab is administered i.v. on a weekly basis and long-term
treatment is not economical. Furthermore, a large number of
patients do not respond to trastuzumab treatments due to de novo
resistance. In addition, many patients who initially respond have
their tumors begin to regrow within 1 to 2 years, leaving them very
limited treatment options (12, 13). Hence, there is an urgent need
for potent and erbB2 RTK–selective small-molecule inhibitors for
long-term p.o. treatment.
We have described the identification and pharmacologic characterization of CP-724,714, a novel erbB2 receptor–selective RTK
inhibitor. CP-724,714 is a potent inhibitor of erbB2 receptor kinase
(IC50 10 nmol/L) in vitro and also in an intact cell–based assay (IC50
32 nmol/L). It is an erbB2 RTK–selective compound (500–1,000-fold
selective against erbB1 and other related RTKs). It induces G1 cell
cycle block in vitro in erbB2-overexpressing BT-474 human breast

carcinoma cells. In ex vivo studies, CP-724,714 treatments resulted in
a concentration-dependent reduction of erbB2 receptor phosphorylation. When administered p.o., CP-724,714 preferentially inhibited
tumor growth of erbB2-overexpressing human breast carcinomas in
athymic mice. In addition, CP-724,714 treatments induce reduction
of downstream erbB2 RTK signaling (phospho-Akt, phospho-Erk1,
and phospho-Erk2), tumor cell apoptosis, and release of caspase-3.
CP-724,714 induced regression of BT-474 tumors and significant
inhibition in a number of other human tumor xenografts. Additionally, CP-724,714 showed a favorable nonclinical toxicity profile
with no apparent effects on cardiac tissue. On the basis of these
promising preclinical results, CP-724,714 was advanced to phase I
clinical trials and is potentially another option for women with
Her2-driven breast cancer.
