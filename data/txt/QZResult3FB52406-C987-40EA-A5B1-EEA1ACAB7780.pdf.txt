BACKGROUND: In this phase 1 trial, the authors evaluated sunitinib combined with radiation therapy (RT) for the
treatment of primary or metastatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancies. METHODS: Eligible patients had CNS
malignancies that required a (minimum) 2-week course of RT. Sunitinib (37.5 mg) was administered daily for the duration of RT with optional treatment extension of 1 month. Urine was collected at 3 time points for correlative biomarker studies. The primary endpoint was acute toxicity defined according to Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled (12 with CNS metastasis and 3 with primary tumors). RT doses ranged from
14 Gray (Gy) to 70 Gy (1.8-3.5 Gy per fraction). Acute toxicities included hematologic, nausea, hyperglycemia, fatigue,
hypocalcemia, and diarrhea. Six patients (40%) developed grade 2 toxicities. Grade 3 toxicities occurred in 7
patients (47%) and included hematologic toxicity, fatigue, deep vein thrombosis, dysphasia, hyperglycemia, and hyponatremia. No grade 3 through 5 hypertensive events or intracerebral hemorrhages occurred. Two grade 5 adverse
events attributed to disease progression occurred. The median follow-up was 34.2 months. Two patients (13%)
achieved a partial response, 9 patients (60%) had stable disease, and 2 patients (13%) patients had progressive disease. The 6-month progression-free survival rate for patients who had brain metastasis was 58%. Grade 3 hematologic toxicity was correlated with greater changes in vascular endothelial growth factor levels changes between
baseline and the completion of RT. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous 37.5-mg sunitinib combined with RT in patients who
had CNS malignancies yielded acceptable toxicities and adverse events. The current results indicated that changes in
urine vascular endothelial growth factor levels are associated with hematologic toxicity, and this association should
be analyzed in a larger cohort. The feasibility, safety, and early response results warrant a phase 2 trial. Cancer

Preclinical studies suggest that the combination of angiogenic blockade and radiotherapy (RT) can enhance the
therapeutic ratio of ionizing radiation through the phenomenon of vascular normalization.1,2 Although it is counterintuitive and poorly understood, combining ionizing RT and antiangiogenic agents may cause aberrant tumor vessels to
regress,3,4 thereby increasing tumor oxygen concentration and acting as a potential radiosensitizing agent. Antiangiogenic
agents also may decrease interstitial fluid pressure within tumors, allowing improved oxygen delivery to hypoxic tissues.5,6

Furthermore, antiangiogenic agents have multiple
other effects on the tumor microenvironment which may
impact the tumor response to radiation therapy. Agents
that disrupt the phosphoinositol-3 kinase/protein kinase
B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-Akt-mTOR)
signaling pathway may radiosensitize the vascular endothelium.7 The ability of endothelial progenitor stem cells,
which contribute to tumor angiogenesis and growth, to
mobilize and recruit can be impaired by agents that
disrupt the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway.8-10 Preclinical
studies in glioma11 and meningioma12 suggest that antiangiogenic agents may have an enhanced radiosensitizing
effect in central nervous system (CNS) tumors.
SU11248 (sunitinib) is an orally active, indolinone-based, multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively targets vascular endothelial growth
factor receptors 1 through 3 (VEGFR1, VEGFR2,
VEGFR3), platelet-derived growth factor receptors a
and b (PDGFRa, PDGFRb), stem cell factor receptor
(c-KIT), neurotropic factor receptor (rearranged during
transfection [RET]), FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3),
and colony-stimulating factor 1R (CSF-1R).13-22 Sunitinib is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as monotherapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma
and imatinib-refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumor
(GIST).
Despite an array of tumor markers currently in use,
none serve as general predictors of outcome after therapy.
In theory, angiogenic factors can identify patients who are
at risk for recurrent disease regardless of tumor type,
because the process of angiogenesis is ubiquitous to cancer. Urine biomarkers provide a noninvasive platform to
interrogate disease status and tumor biology. On the basis
of this information, we hypothesized that urine VEGF
measured at baseline, at the end of RT, and at 1 month after RT may be predictive of treatment response.
The combination of RT and VEGF pathway-targeting antiangiogenic agents has demonstrated tumor growth
delay and tumor cell killing in preclinical studies.23-27 In
addition, preclinical models with sunitinib and ionizing
radiation have demonstrated a more than additive effect
on tumor growth delay compared with either treatment
alone.3,28,29
We evaluated the safety and toxicity profile of 37.5
mg of oral sunitinib administered daily to patients undergoing RT for primary or metastatic central nervous system
malignancies. In addition, we evaluated correlative urine
biomarker results and early response rates for this
regimen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
This study received approval of the Kimmel Cancer Center Research Review Committee and Thomas Jefferson
University Institutional Review Board (IRB) (IRB
06C.549) before patient recruitment and accrual. Patients
with histologically confirmed primary or metastatic CNS
malignancies whose treatment involved a minimum 2week course of RT were eligible. Patients who had widely
metastatic disease with brain metastases did not have biopsy confirmation of their brain metastases if they had
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings that were
characteristic of brain metastases. Other eligibility
requirements included age 18 years, a World Health
Organization performance status between 0 and 2,30 and
a life expectancy >3 months. Prior surgery, chemotherapy, and/or RT (including RT to the CNS) were allowed
provided there was resolution of all acute toxic effects
of prior therapies (grade 1 according to National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3
[CTCv3]).31 Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal
function (defined as hemoglobin >9 g/dL, platelet count
>100,000, absolute neutrophil count >1500/lL, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels <2.5 times the
upper limit of normal [ULN], total serum bilirubin <1.5
times the ULN, serum calcium <12 mg/dL, and serum
creatinine <1.5 times the ULN) was required.

Study Design
The study involved a baseline screening assessment period, treatment, and an observation period. During treatment, sunitinib 37.5 mg was given orally starting the first
day of RT and was taken daily throughout the RT course,
including weekends. This regimen was chosen based on
multiple phase 1 and 2 studies in metastatic renal cell carcinoma,32,33 GIST,34 and soft tissue sarcoma,35 which
demonstrated that this schedule was well tolerated
and had a manageable toxicity profile. In addition, we
hypothesized that a continuous daily regimen would maximize the potential radiosensitizing effect. The total dose
and fractionation of RT varied depending on tumor type,
prior RT doses, and physician preference. Dose-limiting
toxicities (DLTs) were defined as any grade 3 through 5
toxicity attributable to sunitinib, excluding grade 3 hematologic toxicity unless it clearly was dose limiting. Early
termination of the study was stipulated if the DLT rate
exceeded 50%. A provision for de-escalation to sunitinib
25 mg using the standard 3 þ 3 phase 1 trial design

5549

Original Article

(Design 1 described by Simon et al36) was permitted if
>33% of patients enrolled experienced a DLT. Patients
who experienced minimal toxicity were given the option
to continue sunitinib for an additional 30 days after the
completion of RT. All patients had weekly hematology
and chemistry panels. Corticosteroid use before treatment, during treatment, and at 1-month follow-up was
documented. Corticosteroids were not required but were
used as necessary at the discretion of the treating
physicians.
The primary endpoint of this study was to evaluate
the toxicity and safety profile of combining sunitinib and
RT. Secondary endpoints included assessment of radiographic tumor response at 1 month and urine biomarker
changes.

Toxicity Grading and Evaluation of Response
All toxicities were documented according to CTCv3 criteria,31 and patients were evaluated for potential DLT
weekly during treatment and 4 weeks after the completion
of treatment. Pertinent history, physical examinations,
and hematology and chemistry studies were completed
weekly during treatment and 1 month after the completion of treatment. MRI studies or computed tomography
scans were completed approximately 1 month after study
completion and at regular follow-up appointments thereafter, depending on the diagnosis, to assess early response.
Formal neurocognitive functional assessments were not
performed. Early imaging response was assessed using the
criteria described by Macdonald et al.37

Patients, Urine Collection, and Processing
Urine was collected from all study patients at baseline, at
the completion of RT, and 1-month post-treatment.
Urine was stored at 20 C before evaluation and then
centrifuged at 3000 revolutions per minute for 10
minutes at 4 C. The supernatant was used for subsequent
assays. Urinary creatinine levels were obtained on the
Bayer DCA 2000þ Analyzer (Bayer HealthCare, Elkhart,
Ind) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All samples were normalized by creatinine level. Urine samples
were assayed for VEGF, the met proto-oncogene (MET),
matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-2), and MMP-9.
These biomarkers were chosen for analysis, because previously published data suggested an association between
these biomarkers and brain tumors.38,39

5550

Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassays
MET, MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF were measured in
urine specimens using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, Md).
All samples were thawed at room temperature for 4 hours
before evaluation. MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF assays
were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
MET levels were detected according to a previously published protocol.40
Statistical Methods
To assess clinical efficacy, the neurologic progression-free
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were calculated from the time of enrollment using the Kaplan-Meier
method.41 Median urinary VEGF levels over time were
compared using the Friedman chi-square test based on
ranks. Median levels of VEGF fold-change were compared based on the development of hematologic toxicity
using the exact Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All statistical tests
were 2-sided, and P values  .05 were considered
significant.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Treatment
Fifteen patients were accrued between April 16, 2007 and
January 7, 2008. Table 1 displays patient characteristics
and total RT dose and fraction size. Two patients had
received previously RT to the brain. The median total
dose was 37.5 Gy (range, 14-70 Gy), including 5 patients
who received >50 Gy. The median dose per fraction was
2.5 Gy (range, 1.8-3.5 Gy). Thirteen patients completed
the prescribed treatment. One patient died during treatment, and another patient chose to discontinue sunitinib
secondary to decreased blood counts, vomiting, and fatigue. Seven patients (47%) chose to continue daily sunitinib for 30 days after the completion of RT.
Toxicity Evaluation
Six patients (40%) had grade 1 or 2 toxicities, including
fatigue, hyperglycemia, nausea, hypocalcemia, and diarrhea. Hematologic toxicities were most common, and
nearly all patients had at least grade 1 anemia, leukopenia,
or thrombocytopenia. Toxicities are listed according to
grade in Table 2.
Grade 3 toxicities occurred in 7 patients (47%).
Two (13%) grade 3 toxicities met the criteria for DLT.
The other grade 3 toxicities were considered attributable
to the combination of sunitinib with RT and were not

based on RT fraction size or total dose administered.
There was no observed difference in skin toxicity or toxicity of other tissues within the radiation portal. No grade 4
or 5 hypertensive events or intracerebral hemorrhages
occurred. Two grade 5 adverse events (status epilepticus
and pulmonary embolism) occurred, and the medical
monitor determined that these events were related to disease progression. One patient with metastatic melanoma
who was retreated with WBRT after previous WBRT and
stereotactic radiosurgery died on Day 4 of treatment from
uncontrolled status epilepticus, which was attributed to
multiple brain metastases. A second patient with multiple
brain metastases from nonsmall cell lung cancer died 6
days after study completion from a presumed pulmonary
embolism.
Early Response
Thirteen patients had follow-up MRI imaging to assess 1month tumor response. Two patients (15%) achieved a
partial response, 9 patients (70%) patients had stable disease, and 2 patients (15%) had disease progression. All 3
patients with primary CNS tumors had stable disease.
Among the patients with metastatic disease, 2 (20%) had
a partial response, 6 (60%) had stable disease, and 2
(20%) had progressive disease (Table 3). Before the initiation of treatment, 5 patients (33%) were receiving highdose corticosteroids. At 1-month follow-up, none of the
patients required corticosteroids. Three patients (20%)
initiated corticosteroid therapy during RT, and all were
tapered off corticosteroids within 1 month after RT.
One patient initially presented with multiple, small,
parenchymal, metastatic brain lesions from adenoid cystic
carcinoma, the largest of which was located in the right
parietal lobe and measured 14  10 mm with an additional 12  8 mm lesion in the right frontal lobe. After

finishing RT and continuing sunitinib for 1 month, an
MRI revealed an interval decrease in the size of all previous parenchymal enhancing lesions. Another patient with
metastatic renal cell carcinoma presented with a 4.6-cm,
dural-based mass involving the sphenoid sinus, sella,
suprasellar cistern, clivus, and cribriform plate with residual tumor after transphenoidal resection. A 1-month follow-up MRI revealed a significant decrease in the size of
the skull base lesion with no enhancement and no metabolic activity on a positron emission tomography.
Survival
At a median follow-up of 34.2 months, 6 patients continued to have stable disease, and 7 patients had disease progression. The PFS rate at 6 months was 60%, and 9
patients had stable disease (Fig. 1). Four of the original 15
patients (27%) remained alive at the time of this report.
The median survival was 8.8 months (Table 4). Eleven
patients (73%) remained alive 6 months after treatment,

and survival for all patients ranged from 0.1 months to
39.9 months. Among those with brain metastases, 2 of 12
patients (18%) remained alive (range, 0.1-39.9 months).
Seven patients (58%) who had brain metastases were progression-free for 6 months.
Urine VEGF
Urine samples were collected from 13 of the 15 patients
enrolled on this study. Samples were collected from 12 of
13 patients at baseline, from 10 of 13 patients at the end
of RT, and from 5 of 13 patients 1 month after RT. Urine
VEGF levels were detectable in 24 of 27 samples (89%).
The median VEGF concentration for at time points for
patients who had detectable levels was 336 pg/mg (range,
53-1153 pg/mg). There were no statistically significant
differences in VEGF levels between any of the 3 time
points (Friedman chi-square test; P ¼ .87) (see Fig. 2).
Only 10 patients had paired baseline and end-of-RT
samples. For the current analysis, we assumed that
patients who had undetectable VEGF levels had values of
24 pg/mg, which was the lowest detectable level of VEGF
for our assay. Four of 10 patients (40%) had an increase
>3-fold (relative to baseline) in their urine VEGF level.
This is similar to the >3-fold increase in plasma VEGF
levels reported in 44% of patients with metastatic renal
cell cancer who received sunitinib.42
Paired samples between baseline and 1 month after
RT were available for 4 patients. We were unable to correlate changes in urinary VEGF levels and RT response
because of the lack of paired samples. Of the paired sam-

ples, 2 of patients had metastatic melanoma and continued on sunitinib after RT. One patient had a >2 fold
increase in VEGF from baseline to 1 month after RT and
developed progressive disease, and the other patient had a
72% reduction in VEGF between the same time points
and had stable disease. We also analyzed changes in
VEGF levels between baseline and the end of RT in
patients who did and did not develop grade 3 hematologic
toxicities. Three of 5 patients who developed grade 3 hematologic toxicities had paired urine samples between
baseline and the end of RT, whereas 5 of 5 patients who
did not develop grade 3 hematologic toxicity had paired

was 324 pg/mg (range, 44-1109 pg/mg), and there was no
significant difference between time points. An increase in
MET from baseline to the end of RT was observed in 5 of
10 patients, and the median fold increase was 1.8 pg/mg
(range, 1.7-21 pg/mg).
Urine MMP-2
Urine MMP-2 was detectable in 11 of 27 samples (41%).
The median MMP-2 concentration over all 3 time points
for those with had detectable levels was 878 pg/mg (range,
199-10,359 pg/mg). Given the high number of samples
with undetectable MMP-2 levels, further analysis was not
carried out for this biomarker.

fold changes (fc) (in pg/mg) between baseline and the end
of radiation therapy are illustrated for patients who did not
(n ¼ 5) and did (n ¼ 3) develop grade 3 or 4 hematologic
toxicity during treatment. Median values for those who did
not develop toxicity and those who did develop toxicity differed significantly (0.8 pg/mg [range, 0.4-2.2 pg/mg] vs 5.0
pg/mg [range, 4.1-17.8 pg/mg], respectively; P ¼ .037; Wilcoxon rank-sum exact test). Wilcoxon scores are plotted and

samples. The median fold change in VEGF levels (end of
RT/baseline) between patients with versus without a grade
3 hematologic toxicity was 5.0 versus 0.75, respectively
(P ¼ .036) (see Fig. 3). The median RT dose delivered to
these 2 groups did not differ significantly (P ¼ .39).
Urine MMP-9
Urine MMP-9 was detectable in 21 of 27 samples (78%).
All 6 undetectable samples were from patients with metastatic melanoma and were over various time points (3 at
baseline, 2 at the end of RT, 1 at 1 month after RT). The
median MMP-9 concentration over all 3 time points for
those with detectable levels was 2095 pg/mg (range 80804,101 pg/mg), and there was no significant difference
between time points. To determine the median fold
change for patients who had paired samples (baseline and
the end of RT) available, we assumed that the MMP-9
levels in undetectable samples were 72 pg/mg, which was
the lowest detectable level of MMP-9 for our assay. An

DISCUSSION
In this trial, we sought to assess the safety and tolerability
of combining RT to intracranial tumors with continuously dosed sunitinib. Overall, the combination of sunitinib and RT was well tolerated. Most toxicities were not
severe and did not limit the patient’s ability to complete
the combined course. Toxicity was limited to grade 1/2 in
40% of the patients in this study. Forty-seven percent of
the patients in this study had grade 3 toxicities, which
most commonly were hematologic and were without significant clinical consequences. We were particularly interested in differentiating toxicity that occurred as a result of
sunitinib, RT, or the combination to assess the potential
for a more than additive toxicity profile. Among the 14
grade 3 toxicities, 7 hematologic and metabolic toxicities were attributed to sunitinib, 2 were attributed to RT,
2 were attributed to the combination, 1 was attributed to
disease progression, and 2 venous thromboembolic events
occurred that may have been related to sunitinib or to the
underlying procoagulant status of patients with brain
tumors. The grade 3 toxicity rate did not increase with
increasing RT dose.
Comparing the experience from this trial with the
known toxicity data on WBRT is possible in a limited
manner. Over the past decade, 4 prominent phase 3 trials
have included a WBRT-alone control arm: Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial 0118,43 a trial of
efaproxiral (RSR-13),44 RTOG 9508,45 and motexafin
gadolinium.46 Compared with these historic controls, the
rate of treatment-related adverse events from continuously
dosed sunitinib and intracranial RT may be modestly
higher than the toxicity of WBRT alone (see Table 5).
To our knowledge, only 1 other study has evaluated
the toxicity of continuously dosed sunitinib and RT: Kao

et al47 recently published their experience treating 21
patients to 36 non-CNS oligometastatic sites with a combination of sunitinib and hypofractionated, image-guided
RT. Those authors reported a 57% response rate and
28% rate of stable disease; and they described a DLT in 1
of 10 patients when sunitinib 37.5 mg was combined with
10 Gy  5 fractions. In that trial, 2 of 5 patients had a
DLT with sunitinib 50 mg combined with 10 Gy  5
fractions. The 1-year local control, PFS, and OS rates
were 85%, 44%, and 75%, respectively. The authors concluded that the combination of sunitinib (25-37.5 mg)
plus image-guided RT was tolerable in patients with oligometastatic disease without potentiation of RT-related
toxicity. The rate of grade 3 through 5 toxicities from continuously dosed sunitinib and intracranial RT is similar to
the rates reported from other larger studies that used continuous daily dosing with sunitinib 37.5 mg alone. However, comparisons are difficult, because patients on
continuously dosed sunitinib trials may have received a
greater number of previous therapies and/or a longer duration of exposure to sunitinib.

A debate remains about the optimal timing of antiangiogenic therapies and RT. Preclinical studies on the inhibition of VEGF2 and the window of vascular
normalization and radiosensitization by Winkler et al48
suggested an open window for maximum radiosensitivity
in the range of 4 to 6 days after the initiation of antiVEGF2 therapies. In the clinical setting of glioblastoma
multiforme, Batchelor et al49 described imaging techniques for detecting vascular normalization after antiangiogenic therapy. They discovered that vascular
normalization may begin immediately upon antiangiogenic therapy and has a window that lasts approximately
28 days. The scheme for RTOG 0825, a phase 3 study
testing RT and temozolomide with or without bevacizumab, starts bevacizumab after 30 Gy of the planned 60 Gy
of RT have been delivered. Future clinic trials in this arena
should use advanced imaging techniques like diffusionweighted MRI or permeability mapping through dynamic
contrast-enhanced MRI to determine the optimal timing
of concurrent antiangiogenic therapy and RT. Alternately,
the development of blood-based or urine-based

Cancer

biomarkers of vascular normalization could be developed
to guide the optimal timing of these therapies.
Concern about using antiangiogenic agents in
patients with brain metastases has been raised by Pouessel
and Culine50; however, no patients in our current study
experienced intracranial hemorrhage. Similarly, there
were no episodes of intracranial hemorrhage reported in
15 patients with recurrent malignant glioma who received
bevacizumab and RT in a pilot study conducted at the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.51
When antiangiogenic drugs alter vascular permeability, they may change the apparent size of tumors without affecting the underlying tumor mass, compromising
our ability to observe these tumors on MRI studies.
Therefore, response rates as an indication of treatment efficacy should be interpreted with caution when antiangiogenic agents are used.
Over all time points, our patients had a median
urine VEGF level of 336 pg/mg. This is similar to the
mean urine VEGF level of 317 pg/mg reported at baseline
for a cohort of patients with prostate, breast, brain, and
hematologic malignancies.39 However, other studies have
reported median urine VEGF levels of 753 pg/mL at presentation in a cohort of pediatric and adult patients with
brain tumors and 101 pg/mL at baseline in patients with
advanced soft tissue sarcomas.38,52 These results emphasize the wide range of baseline urine VEGF levels observed
for different histologies and stages of disease. It also suggests that looking at trends between different time points
is likely to be more fruitful as a predictive marker than
using absolute cutoff values. However, given the limited
number of patients with complete urine sets, we were
unable to determine which comparisons between time
points may be most predictive of response.
We observed a correlation between grade 3 hematologic toxicity and higher VEGF fold changes between
baseline and the end of RT. Significant changes in white
blood cell counts during sunitinib treatment have been
reported in patients with GIST.53 The largest proportional decrease was noted in monocytes, which may reflect
the finding that monocytes have higher expression of
VEGF receptor 1 relative to other peripheral blood mononuclear cells.53 Sunitinib-related peripheral blood mononuclear cell changes also may be related to ‘‘off-target’’
inhibition of KIT and FLT-3. Given the small dataset,
this finding is hypothesis-generating and merits evaluation in future studies.
We are encouraged in this limited study by the
responses observed. The 58% 6-month PFS rate in

Cancer

December 15, 2011

patients with brain metastases is higher than that reported
historically.54-56 The RTOG reported that brain metastases were the cause of death in 33% to 50% of patients who
were enrolled on studies 7916, 8528, and 8905.54 The
13% rate of neurologic death in our study also compares
favorably with historic data. We are aware that patient
selection can bias small studies, and this improvement will
have to be validated by a larger study.
In conclusion, 37.5-mg daily dosing of sunitinib
combined with cranial RT yielded acceptable toxicities
and adverse events. This unique combination also produced intriguing responses. A phase 2 study further evaluating the use of sunitinib as a radiosensitizing agent in the
setting of brain metastases is being planned by the
RTOG.
