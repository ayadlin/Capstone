Abstract
Several DNA- and microtubule-binding agents are used to
manage hematologic malignancies in the clinic. However, drug
resistance has been a challenge, perhaps due to a few
surviving cancer stem cells. Toxicity is another major
impediment to successful chemotherapy, leading to an
impoverished quality of life. Here, we show that a semisynthetic nontoxic tubulin-binding agent, 9-bromonoscapine
(EM011), effectively inhibits growth and regresses multidrug
resistance-associated protein (MRP)-overexpressing teniposide-resistant T-cell lymphoma xenografts and prolongs
longevity. As expected, teniposide treatment failed to regress
teniposide-resistant xenografts, rather, treated mice suffered
tremendous body weight loss. Mechanistically, EM011 displays
significant antiproliferative activity, perturbs cell cycle progression by arresting mitosis, and induces apoptosis in
teniposide-resistant lymphoblastoid T cells both in vitro and
in vivo. EM011-induced apoptosis has a mitochondriallymediated component, which was attenuated by pretreatment
with cyclosporin A. We also observed alterations of apoptosisregulatory molecules such as inactivation of Bcl2, translocation of BAX to the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c
release, and activation of downstream apoptotic signaling.
EM011 caused DNA degradation as evident by terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP-biotin end labeling staining of the increased concentration of 3¶-DNA ends.
Furthermore, the apoptotic induction was caspase dependent
as shown by cleavage of the caspase substrate, poly(ADP)ribose polymerase. In addition, EM011 treatment caused a
suppression of natural survival pathways such as the
phosphatidylinositol-3¶-kinase/Akt signaling. These preclinical
findings suggest that EM011 is an excellent candidate for
clinical evaluation. [Cancer Res 2008;68(5):1495–503]

Introduction
It is estimated that in the United States, every 10 minutes, a
patient dies from blood cancer. Among the currently available
treatment strategies (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bone
marrow transplantation), chemotherapy, by far, is the largest subset
of treatment options; and various classes of drugs including

epipodophyllotoxins (etoposide and teniposide) and Vinca alkaloids (vinblastine and vincristine) are used to manage hematologic
malignancies (1–3). Although the initial response to these drugs is
impressive, their potential is limited by the development of
multidrug resistance (4, 5), primarily mediated by overexpression
of transmembrane efflux pumps [for example, the M r 170,000
dalton P-glycoprotein (pgp) and the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)] that reduce intracellular drug concentrations
to suboptimal levels, thus, hindering clinical applicability (6, 7).
Another major challenge is toxicity of currently available drug
regimens that includes gastrointestinal toxicity, myelosuppression,
immunosuppression, neurotoxicity, and alopecia (8, 9). Furthermore, because most of these drugs are administered i.v., multiple
infections and frequent hospital visits cannot be avoided (10, 11).
Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel drugs that are
efficacious, well-tolerated, nontoxic, orally available, can overcome
various modes of resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics,
and display better pharmacologic profiles.
Our laboratory has discovered a previously unknown tubulinbinding anticancer property (12–18) of a natural, nontoxic, orally
available compound, noscapine, which is widely used as a cough
suppressant in many countries including Western Europe, South
America, and Asia. After our work, noscapine is already in phase
I/II clinical trials for Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma or Chronic
Lymphocytic Leukemia refractory to chemotherapy. Our continued
efforts to chemically synthesize novel noscapinoids based on
modifications of the parent noscapine and to evaluate their
biological activities for further drug development led to the identification of 9-bromonoscapine (EM011), a significantly more
potent tubulin-binding anticancer agent than noscapine (19, 20),
which preserves the nontoxic attributes of noscapine.
Although epipodophyllotoxins, such as teniposide and etoposide,
are widely used to manage hematologic malignancies, prolonged
teniposide therapy results in the development of drug resistance
(21). Our laboratory has shown that EM011 regresses pgpoverexpressing human lymphoma xenografts implanted in nude
mice (22). We were thus inquisitive to examine if tumors that exhibit
drug-resistant phenotype due to other mechanisms, such as MRP
overexpression (as in teniposide-resistant lymphomas), respond to
EM011 therapy. This also offered us an opportunity to investigate
if EM011 is efficacious in tumors that have become resistant to
other nontubulin-binding conventional agents, such as teniposide,
actively used for lymphoma management. Our present in vitro
findings suggest that EM011 shows significant antiproliferative and
apoptotic activity that was preceded by a potent G2-M arrest in
teniposide-resistant (CEM/VM-1-5) human T-lymphoma cells. Our
in vivo data show the effectiveness of oral EM011 therapy to regress

teniposide-resistant lymphoma xenografts implanted in athymic
nude mice. Importantly, unlike teniposide, EM011 is unique in being
nontoxic to tissues with frequently dividing cells such as the gut and
spleen. We therefore believe that EM011 is an ideal chemotherapeutic agent that merits a thorough clinical evaluation.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and cell culture. EM011 was prepared as described previously
(19). Primary antibodies against human proteins [cytochrome c, caspase-3,

poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), Akt,
phosphorylated BubR1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and
Bim] were from Cell Signaling. The human h-actin antibody was from Santa
Cruz. All secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch.
Monoclonal antibody for a-tubulin and cyclosporin A was from Sigma. Cell
culture reagents were from Mediatech, Cellgro. CEM, a human lymphoblastoid
line and its drug-resistant variant, CEM/VM-1-5, were grown in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. Adenoviruses encoding h-galactosidase, dominant-negative
BubR1, and dominant-negative Bim were prepared and amplified in lowpassage human embryonic kidney 293 cells as described previously (23, 24).

were treated with 10 Amol/L EM011 for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. After the indicated incubation times, cells were processed for a flow cytometry–based terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)_mediated bromo_deoxyuridine triphosphate (BrdUTP) reaction. Addition of BrdUTP to the TdT reaction provides a means to label
the DNA strand breaks and is detected by an Alexa Fluor 488–labeled anti-BrdUrd antibody. DNA content was determined by the binding of DNA-specific dye,
propidium iodide (x-axis). Apoptotic cells were determined by incorporation of BrdUrd at the 3¶-OH ends of the fragmented DNA as measured by anti-BrdUrd Alexa
Fluor 488 fluorescence (y-axis ). Data shown are from a representative experiment of three experiments performed. Cii, the quantitation of apoptotic cells indicated

Growth inhibition 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay. Cells at a
density of 5,000 cells/mL per well in a 96-well format were exposed to
various EM011 concentrations for 48 h, and cell proliferation was measured
colorimetrically by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4- sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay, using the
CellTiter96 AQueous One Solution Reagent (Promega).
Analysis of cell cycle distribution and immunocytochemistry. The
flow cytometric evaluation of the cell cycle status was performed as
described previously (22). Briefly, 10 Amol/L EM011-treated cells were fixed
in 70% ethanol, stained with propidium iodide and RNase A, followed
by analyses on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was performed as previously
described (22).
Evaluation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. The
ampholytic cationic fluorescent probe dihexylocarbocyanine iodide
[DiOC6(3)] was used to monitor EM011-induced changes in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. After drug incubations, cells were loaded
with 50 nmol/L of the probe DiOC6(3) for 30 min at 37jC. The supernatant
was removed, and the cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS. The
measurement of retained DiOC6(3) was examined flow cytometrically.
Immunoblot analysis. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) that were
blocked and incubated with primary and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h and 1 h, respectively. Specific
proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence detection
reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce Biotechnology). For cytochrome c release assays, cells were lysed in lysis buffer
[10 mmol/L HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N¶-2-ethanesulfonic acid;
pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L KCl, and 1 mmol/L EDTA] with protease inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma), frozen and thawed thrice, and spun at 2,000  g for 5 min;
and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 60,000  g for 30 min at
4jC. The supernatant was analyzed for cytochrome c content by immunoblotting. h-actin was used as a loading control. All Western blot experiments were repeated at least twice with similar results.
Preparation of microtubule and supernatant fractions of cell
extracts. The microtubule and supernatant fractions of cell extracts were
prepared as described previously (23). Briefly, cells were treated with
10 Amol/L EM011 for the noted hours, washed, and soluble proteins were
then extracted under conditions that prevent microtubule depolymerization
[0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mol/L MES (pH 6.75), 1 mmol/L MgSO4, 2 mmol/L
EGTA, and 4 mol/L glycerol]. The remaining microtubule fraction was
dissolved in 0.5% SDS in 25 mmol/L Tris (pH 6.8). Total protein
concentration was then determined in each fraction, and equivalent
amounts for each treatment group were loaded on the gel.
Determination of caspase-3 activity and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase–mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay for apoptosis.
Caspase-3 activity was measured using the CaspaseGlo 3/7 Assay System kit
(Promega Corporation) as described previously (22). DNA strand breaks

were identified by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase–
mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay as previously described
(22). Confocal micrographs were also obtained for the TUNEL-stained cells
using a 63 objective.
Animals and implantation of cancer cells. Eight- to ten-week-old
female BALB/c athymic (nu/nu) nude mice (Harlan-Sprague Labs) were
housed in the Emory University Animal Care Facility and were injected s.c.
with 106 CEM/VM-1-5 cells per mouse. Treatment was initiated 7 to 10 days
later when tumors were palpable and measurable (f100 mm3). In control
vehicle-treated groups of each experiment, the rapidly growing lymphoma
tumors required that animals be euthanized when tumor volumes were
z4,000 mm3 or became ulcerated and the mice showed morbidity
[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines of
Emory University]. This served as an end point for these experiments. For
survival studies, the treated groups were observed for 120 days before
euthanasia.
Drug treatment. Tumor-bearing mice were randomly grouped (eight
mice per group). One group of mice were given EM011 (300 mg/kg) in
deionized water (pH 4.0) by daily gavage. Untreated mice received equal
volumes of deionized water (pH 4.0) only. Another group of mice were
treated with 20 mg/kg teniposide (thrice a week) i.v., and untreated control
animals received the vehicle solution i.v. Body weight was monitored every
consecutive day.
Histopathologic and immunohistochemical analyses. At the end
point of control and treatment groups (38 and 120 days, respectively),
spleen, small intestines, liver, and regressed tumors were formalin fixed,
paraffin embedded; and 5-Am sections were stained with H&E. TUNEL
staining of tumor tissue sections was performed as previously described
(22). Activated caspase-3 and Ki67 were detected by immunostaining tumor
sections using specific monoclonal antibodies (DAKO) followed by HRPcoupled anti-mouse IgG staining. Cleaved PARP and phospho-H3 were
detected by immunostaining using a specific monoclonal antibody (Cell
Signaling) followed by HRP-coupled anti-rabbit IgG staining. Counter
staining was done using hematoxylin.
Statistical analysis. The mean and SE were calculated for all quantitative experiments using Microsoft Excel software. The Student’s t test was
used to determine statistically significant differences between groups.
P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

The teniposide-resistant T-lymphoma cells, CEM/VM-1-5, show

overexpression, compared with parental CEM cells (25). To
examine whether these cells respond to EM011, we first evaluated

the effect of EM011 on cellular proliferation. We found that the IC50
of EM011 for these cells was 4.78 Amol/L (Fig. 1Ai). Because EM011
is a tubulin-binding agent that blocks mitosis (22, 26), our next aim
was to follow the cell cycle progression of CEM/VM-1-5 cells upon
drug treatment over time. EM011 treatment resulted in a timedependent accumulation of cells in the G2-M phase as revealed by
an increasing population of cells with 4N DNA with concomitant
losses from G0-G1 phases (Table 1). Figure 1Aii displays the threedimensional profile of cell cycle progression versus time of
treatment. Our results show that the G2-M arrest maximized
(f61%) at 12 h of treatment (Fig. 1Diii). After this, we observed
a disappearance of the G2-M population and emergence of a
characteristic hypodiploid (<2N DNA) sub-G1 peak, indicating
apoptotic cells (Fig. 1Aii and Aiii). This apoptotic population
peaked at 72 h (f86%; Fig. 1Aiii) posttreatment. Together, these
in vitro findings strongly indicate that EM011-treated cells arrest in
the G2-M phase before commencement of cell death.
We then investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying
EM011-induced G2-M arrest to understand its antiproliferative
activity. Microtubule-binding agents such as paclitaxel and
nocodazole are known to block cell cycle progression at mitosis
by activation of the spindle checkpoint, a cellular surveillance
mechanism that ensures accurate chromosome segregation (27).
To examine whether EM011 arrests mitosis by triggering the
spindle checkpoint, we analyzed the phosphorylation of BubR1, a

component of the spindle checkpoint pathway that is phosphorylated during spindle checkpoint activation (28). As shown in
Fig. 1Bi, EM011 treatment rapidly increased BubR1 phosphorylation level, indicating activation of spindle checkpoint. Importantly,
impairment of the spindle checkpoint by dominant-negative BubR1
adenoviruses remarkably inhibited EM011-induced mitotic arrest
(Fig. 1Bii). These data suggest a critical role for spindle checkpoint
activation in mediating the early antiproliferative activity of EM011.

EM011 Triggers Apoptosis in Teniposide-Resistant
Lymphoma Cells
Our next goal was to examine if EM011-induced cell death was
due to apoptosis. Because apoptosis can be detected by characteristic changes in cellular morphology such as the disruption of
cytoskeleton, membrane blebbing, hypercondensation and fragmentation of chromatin, and appearance of apoptotic bodies, we
first microscopically visualized cells treated with EM011 for 72 h
and compared them with vehicle-treated controls. Cells were
stained using a a-tubulin–specific antibody (green) and a DNAbinding dye (red). The vehicle-treated cells showed intact normal
radial microtubule arrays [Fig. 1Biii, left; inset, (top left)] shows a
normal mitotic cell], whereas drug-treated cells showed perturbed
microtubule arrays and fragmented DNA pieces (Fig. 1Biii, right).
We also quantified the increase in concentration of 3-DNA ends
due to DNA fragmentation upon EM011 treatment using a flow

time-dependent increase with f67% TUNEL-positive cells at 48
h of treatment that peaked to f94% at 72 h compared with
vehicle-treated control cells (f2% TUNEL-positive cells; Fig. 1Cii).

EM011-Induced Apoptosis Has Mitochondrial
Contributions
Loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. We next
sought to investigate the mechanism of EM011-induced apoptosis.
Among the various apoptotic pathways recruited by cells for their
own demise, one major mechanism involves loss of mitochondrial
membrane integrity and transmembrane potential (i.e., loss of
DCm; ref. 29). This collapse of DCm is associated with inactivation
of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl2 and recruitment of BAX onto
the outer mitochondrial membrane that results in uncoupling of
the respiratory chain and efflux of small proapoptotic factors,
eventually leading to activation of key executioner caspases,
caspase-3/7 (30, 31). Because biochemical events, such as release
of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, caspase
activation, and PARP cleavage, occur during the mitochondriamediated apoptotic cell death (30, 31), we asked whether EM011induced cell death was also accompanied by these biochemical
events. Interestingly, we found a substantial time-dependent
reduction in cellular uptake of fluorochrome DiOC6(3), indicating
a loss of DCm when CEM/VM-1-5 cells were treated with 10 Amol/L
EM011 (Fig. 2A). The percentage of depolarized cells increased as
a function of time reaching a maximum of f62% at 72 h (Fig. 2A).
Although we can clearly see significant beginnings (f45%) of
loss of DCm at 48 h, completely and directly mitochondriallydependent apoptotic processes are kinetically much faster (32).
These apoptotic processes (e.g., those induced by rotenone and
atractyloside, mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors) are very
rapid (15–20 min; ref. 32). However, this is contrary to what we
observed in our studies with EM011 treatment, thus, pointing to
additional or indirect effects of EM011 on the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway that were investigated next.

www.aacrjournals.org

To address the extent of contribution of the mitochondrial
pathway toward EM011-induced apoptosis, we used cyclosporin A,
a mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor. Our results
show that pretreatment of cells with cyclosporin A for 3 h before
EM011 treatment for 48 h resulted in f39% sub-G1 population
compared with f55% upon EM011 treatment alone (Fig. 2Bi and
Bii). Our experiments to study the drop in DCm correlated with
our flow cytometry data, in that we observed a diminution of
number of cells with depolarized mitochondria when cyclosporin A
was given 3 h before EM011 treatment compared with when EM011
was given alone (Fig. 2C). This is clearly indicative of the protective
effect of cyclosporin A. These results suggest that there is a
mitochondrial component to the total apoptotic response of
EM011, although a partial one. Because mitochondria and microtubules are intimately linked to each other within cells (33), we
next wanted to better understand the mechanism of how the
mitochondrial pathway mediates EM011-induced apoptosis.
Bim release from microtubules. Bim, a protein interacting
with microtubules, has been suggested as a sensor of microtubule
integrity. Many microtubule-binding agents have been reported to
induce Bim dissociation from microtubules, which then leads to
apoptosis by affecting on mitochondrial events (34, 35). To test
whether EM011 uses a similar mechanism to transduce signals
from its effect on microtubules to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, we examined the level of Bim in microtubule and supernatant fractions in cells. As shown in Fig. 2Di, Bim was entirely in
the microtubule fraction in vehicle-treated cells, whereas a significant portion of Bim was detected in the supernatant fraction in
EM011-treated cells, indicating that Bim dissociated from microtubules upon EM011 treatment. Moreover, dominant-negative
Bim adenoviruses could dramatically prevent EM011 to induce
apoptosis (Fig. 2Dii). These results thus suggest that Bim is
crucial for EM011 to induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial
pathway.
Increase in BAX/Bcl2 ratio and release of cytochrome c into
the cytosol. One of the main regulatory steps of apoptotic cell

Cancer Research

death is controlled by the ratio of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic
members of the Bcl2 family of proteins, which determines the
susceptibility to apoptosis. Our results showed that EM011
treatment increases BAX levels in a time-dependent manner,
whereas Bcl2 levels were decreased, which led to an overall
increase in the proapoptotic/antiapoptotic BAX/Bcl2 ratio as a

function of time of treatment (Fig. 3A). The cytochrome c release
was clearly detectable at 48 h and peaked at 72 h of drug treatment
in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3A).
Activation of executionery caspase, caspase-3, and cleavage
of PARP. Our next aim was to examine the involvement of
caspases that are activated upon cytochrome c release and play a
major role in cleaving a variety of substrates. Because caspase-3
activation is considered as a hallmark of the apoptotic process,
we monitored the active form of the cysteine protease using
a small conserved modified peptide substrate that becomes
luminogenic upon cleavage. As shown in Fig. 3B, EM011 stimulated a time-dependent increase of caspase-3 activity in CEM/
VM-1-5 cells, and treatment of cells with a specific inhibitor of
caspase-3 significantly blocked EM011-induced apoptotic cell
death (data not shown). Our immunoblots also showed a timedependent increase in the expression levels of activated caspase-3,
suggesting that EM011-induced cell death is caspase-3 dependent
(Fig. 3A). Once caspase-3 is activated, a number of cellular
proteins are cleaved, including the PARP (36). Our results showed
a time-dependent increase in cleaved PARP levels, a downstream
substrate of the caspase cascade, and a reliable marker of
apoptosis (Fig. 3A).

EM011 Treatment Causes Akt Dephosphorylation

respond to teniposide therapy (20 mg/kg body weight administered intravenously
thrice a week). A, a progression profile of tumor growth kinetics in EM011and teniposide-treated animals compared with both orally and intravenously

mice were euthanized because of overgrown tumors, in compliance with
experimental protocols approved by IACUC of Emory University. Points,

treatment was well-tolerated; mice did not suffer from body weight loss, whereas
teniposide treatment significantly reduced body weight and caused morbidity
(P < 0.05). C, EM011 confers a significant survival advantage over teniposide
treatment compared with vehicle-treated matched controls over the 120-d study
period as evident by Kaplan-Meier analysis.

One of the characteristics of cancer cells is their ability to
evade programmed cell death through the activation of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway (37, 38). PI3K/
Akt kinase activities have thus been shown to be elevated in
primary tumors and cancer cell lines due to gene amplification,
protein overexpression, or mutations of tumor suppressor genes
(38). Activated Akt phosphorylates and inhibits proapoptotic
proteins, including Bad, caspase-9, and forkhead transcription
factors (39–42), thereby inhibiting apoptosis. Because PI3K/Akt
constitutes an important cell survival pathway governing the
apoptotic response, we next investigated the effect of EM011 on
this pathway in a time course experiment. As the activity of Akt is
regulated by phosphorylation, we examined the level of p-Akt
Ser473 in CEM/VM-1-5 cells treated with EM011 at the noted time
points (Fig. 3C). Our results showed a time-dependent decrease
of p-Akt Ser473, although total Akt protein levels remained
unaffected (Fig. 3C). Because inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway
dramatically induces apoptosis in many cancer cell types, we
investigated whether blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway altered the
sensitivity of teniposide-resistant cells to EM011-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, our results showed that cotreatment of EM011
with 20 Amol/L LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, for 48 h, augmented EM011-induced apoptosis in CEM/VM-1-5 cells (Fig. 3D).
In contrast, cotreatment with lower doses of the inhibitor (1 and
5 Amol/L) inhibited Akt phosphorylation; however, this did not
result in significant differences in apoptotic cell death compared
with EM011 alone, as indicated by percent sub-G1 apoptotic
population measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (Fig. 3D). Because high dosages of LY294002 are proapoptotic
and PI3K-independent in other cancer cell lines (43), it is likely
that augmentation of EM011-induced apoptosis at 20 Amol/L
LY294002 may be due to an interaction between LY294002 and
EM011, which is not PI3K-dependent. Nonetheless, these experiments suggested that EM011 treatment causes suppression of the
natural cell survival pathway. However, it is unlikely that
inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway by EM011 plays a major role
in the induction of apoptosis in these lymphoma cells.

normal cell proliferation. Panels represent H&E staining of paraffin-embedded 5-Am thick sections of the spleen, gut, and liver from vehicle- and EM011-treated
groups of mice visualized under 400 magnification. There was no observable histopathological difference in these tissues between the two groups. The splenic follicles
and vascular sinusoids were indistinguishable between the EM011- and vehicle-treated groups; the gut showed normal mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis
mucosa. In addition, livers from animals of treatment group showed normal hepatic lobular architecture and intact portal tracts.

Oral EM011 Treatment Achieves Significant Tumor
Volume Reduction of Teniposide-Resistant Xenografts
in Athymic Nude Mice
Our laboratory has recently shown that EM011 effectively
inhibits the growth of hormone-refractory breast tumors (26) and
pgp-overexpressing vinblastine-resistant lymphomas implanted in
nude mice (22). It was intriguing whether the anticancer effects of
EM011 were restricted to tumors that are resistant due to
overexpression of pgp drug efflux pumps or were applicable to
other drug-resistant mechanisms such as overexpression of MRP.
We also asked if tumors that are resistant to other widely used
lymphoma drugs, such as teniposide, responded to EM011 therapy.
Thus, to investigate the generality of the effectiveness of EM011, we
evaluated its potential in vivo antitumor effects on teniposideresistant T-cell lymphoma xenografts implanted in athymic nude
mice. CEM/VM-1-5 cells were injected s.c. in nude mice, and 7 to
10 days after tumor implantation, when well-established xenografts
were palpable with a tumor size of f100 mm3, mice were randomized into vehicle-control and treatment groups of eight
animals each. The treatment groups received individually therapeutic dosages of EM011 (300 mg/kg orally, daily) and teniposide
(20 mg/kg i.v., thrice a week). Because teniposide is clinically
effective intravenously (unlike EM011, which is orally available), we
included matched control groups receiving the vehicle solution
orally as well as i.v. in our study. Tumor volumes were measured
every consecutive day using vernier calipers. Mice were euthanized
when tumors ulcerated or showed extreme morbid conditions,
according to the IACUC regulations of Emory University. In
vehicle-treated (both orally and i.v.) control animals, the tumors

www.aacrjournals.org

showed unrestricted progression (Fig. 4A). In clear contrast, oral
EM011 treatment showed a time-dependent regression of tumor
burden (Fig. 4A). A reduction in tumor burden by f63% was
observable at 38 days of oral administration. The difference
between the mean final tumor volumes in animals receiving EM011
and those receiving vehicle solution orally was statistically
significant (P < 0.05). All animals in the control group had to be
euthanized by day 38 postinoculation due to tumor overburden, in
compliance with the IACUC guidelines. Another treatment group
examined the effect of i.v. teniposide administration on tumor
volumes compared with their matched controls. As expected for
teniposide-resistant xenografts, mice did not show any significant
reduction in tumor volume upon 20 mg/kg i.v. teniposide
treatment thrice a week compared with control animals (3,388 F
400 mm3 and 3,212 F 289 cm3, average tumor volume F SE for
vehicle- and teniposide-treated groups, respectively at day 38;
Fig. 4A). No statistical differences were observed between tumor
volumes in animals receiving teniposide or matched controls
receiving the vehicle solution i.v. To assess the overall health and
well-being of animals during drug treatment, we measured their
body weight every consecutive day. As shown in Fig. 4B, mice in
EM011 treatment group maintained normal weight gain and
showed no signs of discomfort during the treatment regimen. Thus,
EM011 treatment at a dose level of 300 mg/kg was well-tolerated
and did not show any obvious adverse effect on the general health
of treated mice. However, mice in the teniposide-treated group
suffered significant body weight loss associated with morbidity
(Fig. 4B). We next determined the longevity of surviving mice by
monitoring them for general well-being for 120 days. Kaplan-Meier

analysis revealed a significantly increased survival time with 87.5%
animals treated with EM011 surviving until day 120 (P < 0.05;
Fig. 4C). This was a remarkable prolongation of survival compared
with controls where the median survival time was only 31 days
(Fig. 4C). The teniposide-treated animals did not survive beyond
40 days (Fig. 4C).
Our next question was to examine if tumor reduction upon
EM011 therapy was also due to inhibition of cellular proliferation,
mitotic arrest, and induction of apoptosis. Thus, to examine if the
in vivo results were in congruence with in vitro data, we euthanized
a subset of mice treated with EM011 orally for 22 days (when
significant regression of tumor xenografts was observable) along
with matched controls receiving the vehicle solution orally. The
tumor tissue was excised followed by immunostaining of histologic
sections for proliferation markers, such as the phosphorylated
histone H3 and Ki67 antigen. The phospho-H3 antibody recognizes
histone H3 after its phosphorylation on Ser10 upon chromosome
condensation during prophase (44). A pronounced staining of
phospho-H3 in control sections (Fig. 5A, top left) depicted rapidly
proliferating cells, whereas a diminuted staining was observed in
regressed tumor sections from EM011-treated mice (Fig. 5A, top
right). Our data further showed that immunohistochemical
staining with MIB-1, a monoclonal antibody against Ki67, resulted
in a widespread expression of MIB-1–positive cells in control
sections (Fig. 5A, middle left) reflecting aggressively proliferating
cells, whereas only a few positive cells were visible in tumor
sections derived from EM011-treated mice (Fig. 5A, middle right).
These results suggested that EM011 inhibits in vivo cellular
proliferation. We next asked if EM011 displayed similar antimitotic
activity in vivo as well. Towards this goal, we H&E stained 5-Am
tumor sections at day 22 of treatment. Circular mitotic figures
(Fig. 5A, bottom right, white arrowheads) were clearly visible in the
remaining regressed tumors excised from animals undergoing
EM011 treatment but were absent in tumor tissue from vehicletreated control animals (Fig. 5A, bottom left).
Our in vitro data showed that EM011 induced extensive
apoptosis in teniposide-resistant cells. To draw parallel, we
microscopically examined TUNEL-stained tumor sections from
both vehicle-treated control and EM011-treated groups at 38 days
(end point of control vehicle-treated animals). Consistent with our
in vitro results from the TUNEL assay, we observed numerous
TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 5B, top right) in the regressed tumor
sections of EM011-treated animals. We moved on to confirm if our
in vitro findings indicating caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage
correlated with our in vivo results. Consistent with our in vitro
data, we observed immunohistochemically a widespread expression of activated caspase-3 (Fig. 5B, middle right) and cleaved PARP
(Fig. 5B, bottom right) in the small regressed tumor sections from

mice of EM011-treatment group at day 38. In contrast, there was no
significant staining in the control tumor sections (Fig. 5B, middle
and bottom left). We thus concluded that the regression of tumor
xenografts is a result of EM011-induced apoptosis.

EM011 Therapy Does Not Cause Any Histologic
Toxicity
The rational approach of treating cancer is targeting of selective
differences between a cancer cell and a normal host cell. Unfortunately, many of the available drugs do not discriminate very well
between a normal and a neoplastic cell, rather target all rapidly
dividing cells such as the gut and spleen. Thus, a range of unwanted
toxic effects accompanies their use, which is a clear reflection of their
nonselective behavior. Unlike conventional tubulin-binding chemotherapeutics that mess up the microtubule system in extremity,
noscapinoids are distinctive, perhaps because they do not alter the
steady-state monomer/polymer ratio of tubulin. Thus normal cells,
owing to robust cell cycle checkpoint controls, arrest until the drug is
cleared out by metabolism/excretion, whereas cancer cells due to
mutational lesions in their checkpoint mechanisms do not halt for a
longer duration. They rather continue to traverse the cell cycle, thus,
accumulating massive DNA amounts that trigger apoptosis owing to
genotoxic stress (14). Thus, to investigate if EM011 results in toxicities
to normal tissues, we examined tissue sections of the spleen, gut, and
liver of tumor-bearing mice by H&E staining (Fig. 5C). Our results
showed that EM011 therapy did not cause any detectable pathologic
abnormalities in mice, and there was a complete absence of
metastatic lesions in these organs.
Taken together, our data provide compelling evidence that
EM011 is efficacious in inducing apoptosis and suppressing growth
of MRP overexpressing cells. More importantly, EM011 is potently
active in regressing tumors that have become resistant to
teniposide, a drug actively used for lymphoma management in
the clinic. In addition, EM011 therapy is oral and nontoxic, which is
a unique edge over currently available chemotherapeutics.
Therefore, we believe that EM011 is a promising nontoxic drug
candidate with potential for management of hematologic drugresistant malignancies.
