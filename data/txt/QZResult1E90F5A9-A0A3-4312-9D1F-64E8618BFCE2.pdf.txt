Ewing sarcoma is the second most common type of bone cancer in children and young adults. In recent years, the
mechanisms by which these tumors develop and maintain their vascular supply have been elucidated. Additional
work has demonstrated that inhibition of angiogenic pathways or disruption of established vasculature can attenuate
the growth of Ewing sarcoma mouse xenografts. Early clinical data suggest that these results also may extend to
patients with Ewing sarcoma who are treated with antiangiogenic or antivascular therapies. For the current review,

Ewing sarcoma is the second most common primary bone cancer affecting children and young adults. Despite
improvements in outcome for patients with localized tumors,1,2 treatment for those who have metastatic disease remains
unsatisfactory, with long-term overall survival (OS) below 30%, even with significant dose intensification of cytotoxic
therapies.3,4 Patients with recurrent disease also fare poorly, particularly if disease recurs early.5,6 Improvements in outcome for patients with metastatic or recurrent disease likely will require novel therapeutic approaches.
One innovative strategy that has gained interest in recent years has been the use of angiogenesis inhibition and vascular disruption for patients with solid tumors. We performed an extensive review of the available medical literature related
to angiogenesis and vascular supply in Ewing sarcoma. We used the US National Library of Medicine’s PubMed
(www.pubmed.gov) search function to find relevant primary articles based on key search terms, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), thrombospondin, angiogenesis, angiogenic, microvessel, endothelial, vascular, vasculogenesis, bevacizumab, and metronomic. These search terms were searched together
with ‘‘Ewing,’’ ‘‘Ewing’s,’’ or ‘‘bone cancer.’’ The ‘‘Related Articles’’ function of PubMed and reference lists from relevant
articles were used to expand the search and identify additional relevant articles.
In the current review, we summarize the results of this search beginning with a description of the mechanisms by
which Ewing tumors develop and maintain their vascular supply. This is followed by a discussion of the relation between
biomarkers of angiogenesis and features of Ewing sarcoma. Then, the preclinical data supporting an antiangiogenic or
antivascular strategy in this disease are examined. The review concludes with an assessment of the few clinical studies to
date that have treated patients with Ewing sarcoma using these approaches.

Mechanisms of Vascular Supply in
Ewing Sarcoma
Like all solid tumors, Ewing sarcoma tumors require a viable vascular supply for tumor cells to grow beyond the
limits of oxygen and nutrient diffusion into tissues. These
tumors use 3 main strategies to develop and maintain
their vascular supply: angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and
tumor cell vascular mimicry.7 These processes are summarized in Figure 1. VEGF appears to play a crucial role
in these processes across a wide range of tumor types.8 It is
commonly understood that the tumor cells produce 1 or
more VEGF isoforms, which stimulate both proliferation
and survival of the associated tumor endothelium through
its receptors, VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) and VEGFR2. Endothelial cells in Ewing sarcoma tumors demonstrate
a high proliferative rate, indicating active angiogenesis in
these tumors.9 Several lines of evidence have highlighted
the importance of VEGF in driving this process in Ewing
sarcoma. For example, Ewing sarcoma cells that are deficient in the expression of 1 VEGF isoform, VEGF165,
produce smaller tumors with reduced microvessel density
(MVD).10 Re-expression of VEGF165 in these cells
restores MVD.
However, VEGF165 also appears to be important in
the recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells into the
vascular network of Ewing sarcoma, a process known as
vasculogenesis. These bone marrow-derived cells can differentiate into both tumor-associated endothelial cells and
pericytes.11,12 Studies have demonstrated that only
CD34-positive bone marrow-derived cells contribute to
this process.12 VEGF165-deficient Ewing sarcoma cells
recruited significantly fewer bone marrow-derived cells
into xenograft tumors compared with VEGF165-expressing cells.10,13 Forced expression of another VEGF isoform, VEGF189, into VEGF165-deficient cells did not
enhance bone marrow cell recruitment, indicating a specific role for VEGF165 in driving this process. Inhibiting
VEGFR-2 attenuates the recruitment of bone marrow
cells into growing tumors.14 Although VEGF (and specifically VEGF165) stimulates vasculogenesis, other cytokines, such as stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), also
may promote bone marrow-derived cell recruitment into
tumors and provide an alternate pathway to support
vascular development.15
Given the critical role of VEGF in both angiogenic
and vasculogenic processes supporting tumor growth,
interesting data have emerged supporting the hypothesis
that the VEGF pathway actually may be a target of the
EWS/ETS fusion oncoproteins characteristic of Ewing

750

Figure 1. This schematic diagram illustrates the mechanisms
that promote vascular development in Ewing sarcoma. A vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) isoform (VEGF165)
directly stimulates tumor angiogenesis and also recruits bone
marrow-derived endothelial precursors. Tumor cells can be
incorporated directly into the tumor vasculature. Down-regulation of thrombospondin by Ewing sarcoma cells also
promotes angiogenesis. Endothelial-derived platelet-derived
growth factor b (PDGF-b) supports the vascular stroma surrounding the tumor vasculature.

sarcoma. In 1 study, plasmids that expressed EWS/Friend
leukemia virus integration (EWS/FLI) or EWS/ETS
translocation variant (EWS/ETV) were transfected into
RK13 cells, and the levels of VEGF expression were
recorded.16 Transfection of either EWS/FLI or EWS/
ETV resulted in an increase in activation of the VEGF
promoter. Follow-up experiments demonstrated that this
effect does not appear to be caused by direct DNA binding by either EWS/FLI or EWS/ETV and does not
require the presence of the hypoxia response element of
the VEGF promoter.16
Another vascular network system in Ewing sarcoma
may not be driven by VEGF. Ewing sarcoma cells appear
to be capable of directly lining vascular spaces in a process
known as vascular mimicry. In 1 study, pools of blood,
known as blood lakes, were observed in 92% of human
Ewing sarcoma tumor samples.9 The cells lining these
blood lakes were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and
were identified as CD31 negative and CD34 negative but
CD99 positive. Their appearance by electron microscopy
also was characteristic of tumor cell, and not endothelial
cell, origin. Further experiments demonstrated that these
tumor cells expressed tissue factor pathway inhibitor 1

cadherin), and ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2), proteins that apparently are important in vascular mimicry.
Follow-up preclinical studies indicated that the Ewing sarcoma cell lines could form vascular structures to a variable
extent when grown in a collagen matrix; however, the formation of these structures was neither enhanced by VEGF
nor inhibited by VEGF blocking antibody.9 Those cell
lines with a greater propensity for forming vascular structures had greater expression of genes identified in other
malignancies as markers of vascular mimicry, including
integrin a3, VE-cadherin, TFPI-1, EphA2, laminin5c2,
tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and epidermal
growth factor-like domains 1 (Tie-1), neuropilin, and
endoglin. Perfusion and intravital microscopy studies in
Ewing xenografts have demonstrated that these tumor
cell-lined blood lakes appear to be functional and in continuity with the systemic circulation.
Several parallel pathways recently have been implicated in the modulation of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in Ewing sarcoma. The insulin-like growth factor
(IGF) pathway, for example, may positively regulate
VEGF expression. One study has demonstrated that treatment of Ewing sarcoma cells in vitro with IGF-1 increases
expression of VEGF messenger RNA and protein.17
Moreover, treatment of Ewing sarcoma cells with either a
monoclonal antibody directed against the IGF-1 receptor
or transfection with antisense directed against the IGF-1
receptor resulted in significant attenuation in VEGF production.17 Additional work has demonstrated that treatment of Ewing sarcoma cells or mouse xenografts with a
small molecule inhibitor of the IGF-1 receptor attenuated
VEGF production and tumor vascular mimicry.18 Conversely, Ewing sarcoma cells also may stimulate angiogenesis through down-regulation of the endogenous
antiangiogenic protein, thrombospondin. In 1 study,
NIH3T3 cells transfected with the Ewing sarcoma specific
fusion oncogenes EWS/FLI1, EWS/ERG, and EWS/ETV1
had reduced expression of thrombospondin 2.19 This
effect may be mediated by binding of the fusion oncoprotein to the thrombospondin promoter. In Ewing sarcoma
cell lines, thrombospondin 1 expression is repressed. With
short hairpin RNA treatment intended to block the
expression of EWS/FLI1, thrombospondin 1 expression is
restored in these cells.19 These studies indicate that Ewing
sarcoma cells rely on multiple mechanisms to initiate and
maintain tumor vascular supply.
Finally, some consideration must be given to the tumor microenvironment that supports the vascular structures. It has been demonstrated that migration and proper

application of the pericytes and vascular mural cells that
fortify endothelial tubes in developing tissues or tumors
selectively protect vessels against apoptosis when VEGF
levels decline. PDGF-b secreted by the endothelium and
signaling through PDGF receptor b (PDGFR-b) have
been identified as key mediators of this process.20,21 It has
been demonstrated that bone microvascular endothelial
cells themselves express PDGFR-b in vitro, and ligand
binding induces the rapid phosphorylation and subsequent activation of protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal-related kinase 1 (ERK1)/ERK2 that is associated
with an increase in endothelial cell division and survival.22
Indeed, functional PDGFR-b expression has also been
demonstrated in Ewing sarcoma cell lines and in Ewing
sarcoma primary tumor specimens, suggesting an important role for this signaling pathway in tumor development. However, the ligands PDGF-B or PDGF-D do not
appear to be derived from the tumor cells and, in fact,
may derive from the vascular endothelium.23 Finally, in
experimental Ewing sarcoma tumors that recur after exposure to VEGF blockade, vessels are characterized by significant increases in diameter and proliferation of vascular
mural cells with increased expression of factors that promote endothelial integrity (angiopoietin-1 [Ang-1]) and
PDGF-B.24 Thus, it is likely that the PDGF pathway contributes to vascular stability and tumor proliferation in
Ewing sarcoma.
Markers of Angiogenesis in Patients With
Ewing Sarcoma
To consider the potential utility of antiangiogenic and
vascular targeting therapies, it would be helpful to understand the clinical impact of angiogenesis biomarkers in
patients with Ewing sarcoma. Unfortunately, these data
are relatively scarce and difficult to interpret. At least 3
groups have investigated tumor MVD as a prognostic factor in Ewing sarcoma. One group demonstrated a significant association between elevated MVD and poor eventfree survival and OS in 29 patients with Ewing sarcoma.25
In contrast, 2 other groups reported that tumor MVD
does not correlate with metastatic status, disease-free survival, or OS.26,27
Other studies have focused on tumor and blood levels of VEGF, again with conflicting results. One group
assessed VEGF expression by immunohistochemistry in
40 patient tumor samples and observed that patients who
had tumor VEGF expression above the median level had
improved recurrence-free survival and OS compared with
patients who had low VEGF expression.26 Another group

studied 31 patient tumors and concluded that those
patients who had tumors that lacked VEGF expression
had superior OS compared with patients who had tumors
that stained positive for VEGF.16 Like in most oncologic
processes, mean serum VEGF levels in patients with
Ewing sarcoma appear to be higher than those in healthy
controls.28,29 To our knowledge, no study to date has
evaluated the impact of serum VEGF levels on outcome
specifically in patients with Ewing sarcoma. However, 1
study investigated this issue in a cohort of children with a
range of solid tumors, including 5 patients with Ewing
sarcoma.30 In that analysis, patients who had higher serum VEGF levels had inferior outcomes compared with
patients who had lower serum VEGF levels.
Other biomarkers of angiogenesis have not been
studied systematically in patients with Ewing sarcoma.
These markers include soluble VEGFR, thrombospondin,
placental growth factor, and circulating endothelial
cells.31 Larger studies that specifically include patients
with Ewing sarcoma will be required to further assess the
utility of angiogenic biomarkers for prognostic and therapeutic guidance.
Preclinical Efficacy of Antiangiogenic
and Vascular Targeting Strategies in
Ewing Sarcoma
Several antiangiogenic and vascular targeting strategies
have been evaluated in preclinical models of Ewing sarcoma (Table 1). Most of these strategies have focused on
blocking VEGF production or VEGF signaling activity
through ligand neutralization or receptor inhibition. One
group used small interfering RNA directed against VEGF
to attenuate VEGF expression in Ewing sarcoma cell lines
and used these modified cells for subsequent in vivo stud-

752

ies.32 Attenuation of VEGF expression in this manner
slowed the establishment of xenograft tumors, diminished
their growth, and extended the length of time before mice
died from tumor. Tumors from VEGF-attenuated cells
had diminished MVD and diminished osteolysis compared with control cells.32
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed
against all human VEGF isoforms. Although it is used
often to study effects in mouse xenografts, it should be
recognized that bevacizumab does not neutralize murine
VEGF and, thus, leaves unopposed any local production
of VEGF by host stroma. DC101 is a monoclonal antibody directed against murine VEGFR2. VEGF-Trap
(aflibercept) is a recombinant soluble VEGF decoy receptor that binds VEGF with 10-fold higher affinity
than bevacizumab. VEGF-Trap has the additional properties of being active across species and of effectively
neutralizing placental growth factor, which may play a
role in vascular remodeling. In mouse Ewing sarcoma
xenografts, treatment with DC101 resulted in significantly smaller tumors with reduced MVD compared
with mice that were treated with immunoglobulin control.14 Bevacizumab and VEGF-Trap also have been
evaluated preclinically and demonstrated the ability to
retard the growth of Ewing sarcoma mouse xenografts
and even transiently regress established tumors and lung
metastases compared with vehicle controls.33,34 However, regressed tumors uniformly recur, and xenograft
tumors derived from 1 cell line appeared to be more
sensitive to these therapies than those derived from
another cell line. These observations suggest that antiVEGF monotherapy is unlikely to be clinically effective
and that tumor heterogeneity has the potential to influence clinical response.

Angiogenesis in Ewing Sarcoma/DuBois et al

Several small-molecule inhibitors of the VEGFR,
each with additional ‘‘off-target’’ but potentially advantageous tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity, also have been
studied for their effects on Ewing sarcoma growth. Two
early prototypes of these compounds, SU5416 and
SU6668, attenuated tumor growth in Ewing sarcoma
mouse xenografts.34 The Pediatric Preclinical Testing
Program has now evaluated AZD2171 (cedirinib: an inhibitor of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3; c-kit; and
PDGFR-b) and the even broader spectrum sunitinib (an
inhibitor of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3; c-kit;;
PDGFR-b; rearranged during transfection [RET]; and
Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 [Flt-3]).35,36 Both compounds resulted in little in vitro activity against a panel of
Ewing sarcoma cell lines. In contrast, treatment with either compound in vivo resulted in significant prolongation of the time to event (eg, tumor large enough to
require killing) in mouse xenograft models. This pattern
of in vivo activity and lack of in vitro activity supports an
antiangiogenic effect from these agents rather than a direct
tumor cell-inhibitory effect. It is noteworthy that sunitinib was administered according to the usual human dosing schedule of once daily for 4 weeks followed by a 2week rest period. The EW-5 Ewing sarcoma xenograft
revealed essentially complete inhibition of tumor growth
during the 4-week treatment period followed by an
abrupt increase in tumor size after discontinuation of
treatment.36 The similarity of the findings between
AZD2171, a relatively pure VEGFR tyrosine kinase antagonist, and sunitinib, with its broader inhibitory effects,
suggests that the majority of antitumor activity observed
with sunitinib was caused by the inhibition of VEGFR
signaling. However, because both compounds also inhibit
c-kit, the contribution of c-kit inhibition to the antitumor
activity observed in these experiments is unclear.
In addition to strategies directed specifically at
VEGF, other groups have attempted to increase the expression of endogenous antiangiogenic proteins. One group
transfected Ewing sarcoma cells to over express murine
thrombospondin. Mouse xenografts derived from these
transfected cells had attenuated tumor growth in vivo with
diminished MVD compared with tumors that were derived
from control cells.19 Another group investigated the endogenous antiangiogenic isoform of VEGF known as
VEGF165b in Ewing sarcoma.37 Tumors derived from
Ewing sarcoma cells that were engineered to over express
VEGF165b also had attenuated growth. These results suggest that augmentation of endogenous antiangiogenic pathways may have a role against Ewing sarcoma.

The majority of xenograft experiments described
above examined tumor suppression, or the ability of an
agent to prevent tumor growth shortly after tumor inoculation. However, patients often present with bulky tumors
that have established vasculature. Another strategy
reported recently has been to use a group of compounds
known as vascular-disrupting agents, which typically disrupt existing blood vessels by binding to tubulin. In 1
study, researchers evaluated compound OXi4503/CA1P
in preclinical models of Ewing sarcoma.38 Mouse xenografts demonstrated attenuated tumor growth in response
to treatment with OXi4503/CA1P compared with vehicle
control. Treatment with this agent resulted in increased
areas of necrosis and reduced MVD compared with control. This compound did not reduce the proliferation rate
of tumor cells or induce tumor cell apoptosis in these
models, indicating that the result was because of the effect
on tumor vasculature. Treatment with OXi4503/CA1P
and doxorubicin resulted in synergistic reductions in tumor growth, suggesting that this class of drugs may be
used best in combination with chemotherapy for this
disease.
Antiangiogenic and Antivascular Therapies
for Patients With Ewing Sarcoma
Preclinical studies have evaluated a range of different strategies and compounds to inhibit angiogenesis in laboratory
models of Ewing sarcoma. Substantially fewer studies
have been performed using these approaches in patients
with Ewing sarcoma (Table 2). In most of these studies,
patients with Ewing sarcoma have been treated within the
context of phase 1 dose-escalation trials evaluating new
agents in patients with refractory solid tumors. Thus, the
clinical evaluation of antiangiogenic agents for Ewing sarcoma is at a very early stage of development. Although
suggestive of a potential role in this disease, these clinical
results nevertheless are anecdotal and require more
systematic evaluation in studies that specifically aim to
evaluate the activity of antiangiogenic and antivascular
strategies in patients with Ewing sarcoma.
The first antiangiogenic agent to earn US Food and
Drug Administration approval was bevacizumab. A
Children’s Oncology Group (COG) phase 1 study investigated bevacizumab in children with refractory solid
tumors.39 That study included 5 patients who had recurrent or refractory Ewing sarcoma who were treated with
bevacizumab every 2 weeks. No objective responses were
reported. One patient had stable disease for 4 months,
and 2 patients had stable disease for 9 months of therapy.

SD indicates stable disease.

Another study treated 4 patients with Ewing sarcoma with
bevacizumab and liposomal doxorubicin.40 Two of those
patients had stable disease for at least 10 months. These
results, although not definitive, suggest that bevacizumab
may have a clinical role in inhibiting the growth of Ewing
sarcoma.
Based in part on these results and in part on clinical
trial successes in adult colon breast and nonsmall cell lung
carcinoma, bevacizumab currently is being evaluated in 2
ongoing trials for patients with Ewing sarcoma in combination with chemotherapy. This strategy is supported by
growing evidence that VEGF blockade can transiently
‘‘normalize’’ tumor vasculature.41,42 Nascent tumor vasculature is disorganized and hyperpermeable, with poorly
applied pericytes and the absence of normal draining lymphatics. These abnormalities result in both increased interstitial fluid pressure, which impedes drug delivery, and
poor intratumoral perfusion with resultant hypoxia and
acidosis, which can impair cytotoxic drug efficacy. By
restoring balance between angiogenic cytokines in the
tumor microenvironment, it is believed that VEGF neutralization can induce vascular pruning and remodeling,
which transiently improve perfusion and reestablish a gradient favoring drug transit into tumor parenchyma. The
COG has initiated a randomized phase 2 trial of retrieval
chemotherapy with or without the addition of bevacizumab for patients with a first recurrence of Ewing sarcoma.
Patients on that study receive 2 cycles of therapy and
undergo disease restaging. Patients with progressive disease are taken off study, and patients with at least stable
disease are eligible to receive an additional 10 cycles of
this therapy. The primary outcome is progression-free
survival, and approximately 75 patients are expected to
enroll. The European consortium, Innovative Therapies
for Children with Cancer, is pursuing a similar randomized phase 2 design of standard chemotherapy with and

754

without bevacizumab for newly diagnosed patients with
metastatic Ewing sarcoma. In addition to these ongoing
studies, the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is planning a trial combining conventional chemotherapy with
bevacizumab for patients with newly diagnosed Ewing
sarcoma. The results of these trials are eagerly anticipated,
but phase 3 randomized trials with larger numbers of
patients still will be required if definitive efficacy is to be
demonstrated.
Clinical evaluation of oral, multitargeted tyrosine
kinase inhibitors in patients with Ewing sarcoma has been
more limited. The COG is conducting phase 1 studies of
sunitinib43 and sorafenib,44 which targets Raf kinase in
addition to VEGFR and PDGFR. The Pediatric Oncology Branch of the National Cancer Institute is conducting
a phase 1 trial of AZD2171 (cedirinib). The Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute is conducting a phase 2 study of sorafenib
in adult patients with refractory sarcomas. All of these trials include patients with Ewing sarcoma, but they are
ongoing, and response data are not currently available.
In addition, an antiangiogenic strategy known as
metronomic chemotherapy, which involves the application of daily, low-dose, continuous chemotherapy, has
been used in patients with Ewing sarcoma. With this lowdose approach, apoptosis is induced in the less frequently
dividing endothelial cell rather than in the tumor cell, and
the release of bone marrow-derived endothelial precursors
is suppressed.45 At least 3 small studies of metronomic
chemotherapy have included patients with Ewing sarcoma, and there has been some indication of disease stabilization with this approach (Table 2).46-48 The COG has
completed a pilot feasibility study of the addition of celecoxib and thrice-weekly vinblastine along with a conventional chemotherapy backbone in 36 patients with newly
diagnosed, metastatic Ewing sarcoma. The results of that
study are anticipated shortly.

Angiogenesis in Ewing Sarcoma/DuBois et al

Finally, 2 other classes of biologic agents with antiangiogenic properties are under initial investigation in
patients with Ewing sarcoma. First, several monoclonal
antibodies directed against the IGF-1R are being evaluated, and early studies have demonstrated activity in
patients with refractory Ewing sarcoma.49,50 Second,
rapamycin and related mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitors recently have been studied for the
treatment of a range of malignancies. These agents have
antiangiogenic properties that may contribute to their antineoplastic effects.51 One rapalogue, deforolimus, has
demonstrated particular promise in Ewing sarcoma. In
phase 1, 1 patient with Ewing sarcoma had a confirmed
partial response,52 and a phase 2 study of this agent
included 50 patients with bone sarcoma and reported a
30% clinical benefit rate.53 Because inhibition of the
IGF-1R or mTOR pathways may directly inhibit the
growth of Ewing sarcoma cells,54,55 the contribution of
the antiangiogenic effects of these agents to the activity in
Ewing sarcoma remains unclear.
In conclusion, patients with metastatic and recurrent
Ewing sarcoma require novel approaches to improve their
outcomes. Ewing sarcoma tumors have multiple mechanisms by which they develop and maintain their vascular
supply. These mechanisms allow these tumors to continue
to grow in size and to metastasize. Numerous and robust
preclinical studies have demonstrated that targeting these
mechanisms provides a valid approach to inhibiting the
growth of these tumors. Early clinical data suggest that antiangiogenic and antivascular strategies may be beneficial in
the treatment of patients with Ewing sarcoma. Additional
studies are urgently needed to expand these findings, to further evaluate the role of angiogenesis biomarkers, and to
determine how to optimize these strategies for use in the
management of patients with Ewing sarcoma.
