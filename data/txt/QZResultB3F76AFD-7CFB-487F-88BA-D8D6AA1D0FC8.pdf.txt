BACKGROUND: This study examined racial/ethnic differences among patients in clinical trial (CT) enrollment, refusal rates, ineligibility,
and desire to participate in research within the National Cancer Institute’s Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP) Clinical Trial
Screening and Accrual Log. METHODS: Data from 4509 log entries were evaluated in this study. Four logistic regression models were
run using physical/medical conditions, enrollment into a CT, patient eligible but declined a CT, and no desire to participate in research
as dependent variables. RESULTS: Age  65 years (OR 5 1.51, 95% CI 5 1.28-1.79), males (OR 5 2.28, 95% CI 5 1.92-2.71), and nonHispanic black race (OR 5 1.53, 95% CI 5 1.2-1.96) were significantly associated with more physical/medical conditions. Age  65 years
was significantly associated with lower CT enrollment (OR 5 0.83, 95% CI 5 0.7-0.98). Males (OR 5 0.78, 95% CI 5 0.65-0.94) and a
higher grade level score for consent form readability (OR 5 0.9, 95% CI 5 0.83-0.97) were significantly associated with lower refusal
rates. Consent page length  20 was significantly associated with lower odds of “no desire to participate in research” among CT
decliners (OR 5 0.75, 95% CI 5 0.58-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: There were no racial/ethnic differences in CT enrollment, refusal rates, or
“no desire to participate in research” as the reason given for CT refusal. Higher odds of physical/medical conditions were associated
with older age, males, and non-Hispanic blacks. Better management of physical/medical conditions before and during treatment may
increase the pool of eligible patients for CTs. Future work should examine the role of comorbidities, sex, age, and consent form charC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately $201 billion spent each year in direct
medical and indirect mortality costs.1 In 2012, it was estimated that 1,638,910 people would be diagnosed with cancer
and that 577,190 people would die from the disease (all types combined).2 As of January 1, 2009, there were approximately 12,553,337 people in the United States who had a history of cancer (all types combined),2 yet only 3%-5% of
adults with cancer participate in cancer clinical trials.3 Of those who do participate, enrollment rates are lower for minority
groups compared to non-Hispanic whites.4 This is a growing area of concern because racial/ethnic minorities bear the
greatest cancer burden in the United States.5 Clinical trials (CTs) are the mechanism by which new methods of screening,

prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease are developed. A better understanding of what makes minority
recruitment and involvement in CTs successful is critical,
as it will help maximize research investments, investigator
time, patient commitment, trial generalizability, and
allow research questions that are germane to minority
populations to be more relevantly addressed.
Commonly cited reasons for lower CT participation
among minorities include: lack of awareness, mistrust,
cultural barriers, comorbidities, low literacy, language differences, practical obstacles (eg, child care, transportation), lack of invitation, CT design, and lack of health
insurance.6 Given these barriers, it is often assumed that
minorities have less interest in medical research or are
more likely to refuse an offer to participate in a CT than
nonminority groups. These assumptions may not be valid,
and warrant empirical study, as there is growing evidence
that minorities may be just as willing to participate in
health research as their nonminority counterparts when
provided an invitation and opportunity.7-9 Other, potentially more important, factors may play a role in the CT
participation disparity such as: 1) Access/proximity of
CTs to minority communities, 2) Readability and length
of consent forms, 3) Provider bias in offering CTs, 4) Eligibility criteria, and 5) Regional impact on CT attitudes.
To explore these issues, the NCCCP implemented
a Clinical Trials Screening and Accrual Log designed to
track cancer patients at NCCCP sites who were screened
and enrolled into selected NCI Cooperative Group treatment and cancer control CTs. The NCCCP sites selected
trials for the log based on the majority of sites having
access to the trial and the cancer type being studied. A
primary goal of the log was to identify challenges to trial
accrual and to provide information about successful practices to address them, including those for recruiting
under-represented populations into CTs.10,11 Additionally, implementation of the log has allowed NCCCP sites
to: 1) Monitor enrollment rates over time, 2) Identify
gaps in available CTs, 3) Enhance awareness of patient
and physician reasons for declining trial participation in
order to address them, and 4) Raise the visibility and importance of CTs within community cancer centers.12
Another article describes the general details and trends of
the log.13
The objective of this article was to specifically examine racial/ethnic differences among patients in the following areas: CT enrollment, refusal rates, ineligibility, and
desire to participate in research. A better understanding of
these issues may inform future CT recruitment, retention,
and communication strategies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
NCCCP Clinical Trial Screening and Accrual Log
Data Set

In 2008, the Clinical Trial Screening and Accrual Log was
developed and piloted at 15 of the original 16 NCCCP
sites. It officially launched in 2009 and later opened to the
additional 14 sites that joined the program in 2010, for a
total of 29 sites entering data. For the purposes of this article, data from 2009 to 2012 were used in the analyses.
Full details about the development and implementation
of the log are reported elsewhere.12 Items in the log
include demographic information such as age, race, ethnicity, and sex; methods for identifying patients for CTs
(eg, chart review or cancer registry); whether the patient
enrolled into the CT; reasons for ineligibility; patientrelated reasons for declining a CT; and physician-related
reasons for not offering a CT to an eligible patient.
Procedures

Log entries were completed by members of the research
team (eg, a study coordinator or research nurse). Data
from the log was reported to the NCI via an online reporting system on an ongoing basis. To determine how race/
ethnicity would be categorized on the logs, guidelines
from the Office of Management and Budget were followed.14 For this article, race/ethnicity was collapsed into
one variable with 5 categories: non-Hispanic white, nonHispanic black, Hispanic, Asian, and other. The other
category included American Indian or Alaska Native, and
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. To avoid
potential overlap of categories, logs that had “more than
one race” selected were excluded from the analyses. In
addition, if a patient was Hispanic and a racial category,
we treated them as Hispanic. Only logs with complete
race/ethnicity data were included in our analyses, thus
logs with unknown ethnicity or race, or logs with race not
reported were excluded from the analyses.
Logs

A total of 4509 log entries were collected on cancer
patients screened from March 2009 through May 2012.
Sample sizes for analyses ranged from 4184 to 4509
depending on which covariates were used. Log entries
comprised patients screened for at least 1 of 27 trials open
at various times during the data collection period, with
most being treatment trials (81.5%). By cancer type, the
most common trials were of breast (25.9%), colorectal
(22.2%), and genitourinary (18.5%) cancers. The most
common methods for identifying patients for screening

were chart reviews (59.8% of log records), provider referral (30.8%), and clinic schedule review (29.2%).
Measures
Dependent variables

Four dependent variables were evaluated and included
physical/medical conditions, enrollment into a protocol,
patient was eligible but declined participation, and no desire
to participate in research. A priori, we were interested in
examining reasons why patients were ineligible for a CT,
with an assumption that comorbidities would be the driving force behind ineligibility. The full question was
worded as, “If the patient did not meet trial eligibility criteria, indicate the reason why (select all that apply): 1)
Abnormal labs; 2) Abnormal organ function; 3) Comorbidities; 4) Does not meet biomarker testing criteria; 5)
Insufficient or unavailable pathologic samples for study;
6) Patient had progressive disease; 7) Performance status;
8) Prior therapy; 9) Second cancer; and 10) Time requirement. A binary variable for physical/medical conditions
was computed by summing responses to the items: abnormal labs, abnormal organ function, comorbidities, progressive disease, and performance status. A patient with
one or more of these conditions would constitute a “yes”
for physical/medical conditions and were therefore not
considered eligible for a CT. Patients with no conditions
would receive a “no” for physical/medical conditions. The
enrollment question was worded as, “Did the patient
enroll in the protocol (yes/no)?” The patient was eligible
but declined participation item was a part of a larger question written as, “If the patient did not enroll in the protocol, indicate the reason why (select only one): 1) Patient
did not meet trial eligibility criteria, 2) Patient was eligible
but declined participation, 3) Patient was eligible but the
MD declined to offered participation, and 4) Patient was
eligible but started treatment prior to completion of
screening. Lastly, the item no desire to participate in
research was one of 22 social, attitudinal, and/or logistical
response options to the question, “If the patient was eligible, but the patient declined participation, indicate the
patient-related reason why (select all that apply).” Given
our specific interest in racial and ethnic differences in no
desire to participate in research as the reason given for CT
refusal, this was the only response of the 22 choices
selected to be a dependent variable and included in
analyses.

variable of < 65 and  65, with the reference group being
those under 65 years. Sex was coded as male and female,
with females serving as the reference group. Finally, race
and ethnicity were coded as non-Hispanic white, nonHispanic black, Hispanic, Asian, and other, with nonHispanic whites as the reference group. The “other” category included American Indian, Alaska Native, Native
Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander. For all demographic and
other independent variables, the category with the highest
frequency was selected as the reference group.15
A regional variable was computed to
specify the area of the country for which the NCCCP sites
were located. Following US Census guidelines, regions
were categorized as West, Midwest, South, and Northeast,
with the West serving as the reference group.

Informed consent characteristics. We were interested
in the role of page length and grade level readability on
CT participation. It should be noted that page length and
readability were not asked on the log, but rather, calculated independently by evaluating the NCI Cooperative
Group version of the consent form. Continuous and categorical variables for page length were created by counting
the number of pages of the consent forms for each of the
27 CTs included in the log. We selected a cutoff point of
20 pages to create a binary variable for page length coded
as < 20 pages and  20 pages. To assess readability of the
consent forms, a Simple Measure of Gobbledygook
(SMOG) score was generated using Readability Software
by MicroPower & Light Co.16

Data Analysis

Frequencies and means were generated to assess how demographic, consent form, and regional variables were distributed. Chi square tests were used to compare patient
racial/ethnic group differences by CT enrollment, refusal
rates, ineligibility, and the medical reasons for ineligibility
(eg, abnormal laboratory results or comorbidities). Logistic regression was used to assess the effect of race/ethnicity,
age, sex, region, consent form length, and consent form
readability on 4 dichotomized dependent variables
including physical/medical conditions, enrollment into a
CT, patient eligible but declined participation, and no desire
to participate in research as the reason given for CT refusal.
All analyses were done with the full sample of log data.
Correlation analyses were conducted for all covariates in
the logistic regression models and none were highly correlated (ie, a Pearson’s r  0.7). Considering that patients
are nested within hospitals, and hospitals are nested
879

Original Article

within regions, we treated the hospital as a random effect
and region as fixed effect to adjust for potential similarity
of patients within hospital, as well as potential similarities
of hospitals within a region. All logistic regression models
with random effects were run using the GLIMMIX Procedure within SAS, version 9.3.

RESULTS
Demographic, Log, and Consent Form
Characteristics

The mean age was 62 years, with approximately 57% of
patients being under the age of 65 and women comprising
68% of the sample (Table 1). With regard to race/ethnicity, 78% were non-Hispanic white, 13% were nonHispanic black, 4% were Hispanic, 4% were Asian, and
1% was classified as other (eg, American Indian, Alaska
Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander). The average
consent form page length was 17 pages (range, 3-50
pages), with 60% of consent forms being < 20 pages. The
average SMOG reading score for the consent forms was
10th grade (range, 8th to 12th grade). With regard to geographic region of the country, 31% of patients were

Chi Square Analyses

Chi square tests indicated a significant association
between the patient’s race/ethnicity and enrollment into a
CT (Table 2). Asians had a significantly lower proportion
of CT enrollment. The chi square test also indicated a significant association between race/ethnicity, CT ineligibility, and comorbidities. Non-Hispanic blacks had a higher
proportion of not meeting eligibility criteria for a CT and
having comorbidities. There were no significant associations between patient racial/ethnicity and CT refusal
rates, “no desire to participate in research” as the reason
for given for declining a CT, or other medical reasons for
ineligibility (eg, abnormal laboratory results).
Logistic Regression Models

Using physical/medical conditions, enrollment into a CT,
patient was eligible but declined CT, and no desire to participate in research as dependent variables, we ran 4 logistic
regression models with multiple independent variables. The
odds ratios and confidence intervals are reported in Tables 3
and 4. In Model 1, variables significantly associated with
physical/medical conditions (ie, health conditions that would
make a patient ineligible) included age  65 (OR 5 1.51,
95% CI 5 1.28-1.79), males (OR 5 2.28, 95% CI 5 1.922.71), and non-Hispanic black race (OR 5 1.53, 95%
CI 5 1.2-1.96). In Model 2, the only variable significantly
associated with lower enrollment into a CT was age  65
(OR 5 0.83, 95% CI 5 0.7-0.98). In Model 3 (Table 5),
variables significantly associated with eligible patients less
likely to decline a CT included males (OR 5 0.78, 95%
CI 5 0.65-0.94) and a higher SMOG score (ie, written at a
higher grade level) on the consent form (OR 5 0.9, 95%
CI 5 0.83-0.97). Finally, in Model 4 (table not shown), the
only variable significantly associated with fewer instances of
“no desire to participate in research” as the reason for
decline was consent page length  20 pages (OR 5 0.75,
95% CI 5 0.58-0.98).
DISCUSSION
The primary aim of this article was to examine, via the
NCCCP Clinical Trial Screening and Accrual Log data,
racial/ethnic differences in patient enrollment into a CT,
rates of CT refusal, CT ineligibility, and desire to participate in research. Model 1 evaluated the association of age,
sex, and race/ethnicity with physical/medical conditions.
Being over the age of 65 years, being male, and being nonHispanic black were all significantly associated with

higher odds of physical/medical conditions, with comorbidities comprising the majority of responses within the
physical/medical conditions item. Future work should
examine how to design CTs that are more tolerable for
patients with comorbidities, which may include loosening
the eligibility criteria to widen and diversify the pool of
candidates. Another point of consideration is how patients
are cared for prior to getting a cancer diagnosis and how
their comorbidities are managed in general. Better management and earlier identification of comorbid conditions
prior to and during cancer treatment may improve CT
participation for men, those individuals older than 65
years, and blacks in particular, while also improving cancer survival rates over time.17,18
With regard to patient CT enrollment, there were
no racial/ethnic differences in the second logistic regression model. Although the chi square analysis initially
showed a significantly lower proportion of Asians enrolling into a CT, this effect was no longer significant once
race was evaluated in a logistic regression model that controlled for region and site. In particular, there was no
black/white difference in CT enrollment after controlling
for region, site, age, sex, consent form length, and SMOG

that have demonstrated that disparities in willingness to

associated with enrollment into a CT, which is consistent
with other studies.20
Older age ( 65 years) was associated with lower
enrollment into a CT. This finding is not surprising, as
several studies have shown that older cancer patients are
under-represented in CTs, even though many cancers are
diagnosed in patients over the age of 65 and that age alone
is not a valid reason to exclude patients from CTs.21,22 It
is notable that in the NCCCP Clinical Trial Screening and
Accrual Log data set, approximately 43% of CT enrollees
were older than age 65. Future research should explore
potential age bias among providers when offering CTs,
use of geriatric assessment tools that may help determine
if a patient can tolerate a CT, and ways to educate older
patients about the option of CTs.23
Among patients who were eligible, but declined a CT,
there were no racial/ethnic differences in refusal rates,
although males were less likely than females to decline participation. Although it not clear why this may be the case,
some potential explanations include differences in the characteristics of the specific CTs offered to men versus women,
male comfort with research in general, or how, if at all, providers communicate differently to men about their treatment options, which may include a CT. Surprisingly, as
SMOG readability score for consent form increased (ie, as
the grade level at which the form was written increased), CT
refusal among eligible patients decreased. Because there is
limited information on the role of consent form readability
and CT participation, more research is needed to better
understand this relationship.24,25 It should be noted that the
most common reasons that MDs declined offering a CT to
an eligible patient were preference for standard of care
(49%) and concerns about the patient’s ability to tolerate a
CT due comorbidities/frailty (27%).
Finally, there were no racial/ethnic differences in “no
desire to participate in research” as the reason given for
declining a CT. However, consent page length  20 was
associated with lower odds of “no desire to participate in
research” among CT decliners. This finding is somewhat
counter intuitive. More research is needed to better understand the relationship between consent form page length and
CT participation. It should be noted that NCI has launched
a transformed informed consent document template in an
effort to address patient burden and to enhance participant
understanding. This template includes decreases in page
length and is required for use in NCI trials as of May 2013.26
Strengths and Limitations

This study evaluated a large data set of Clinical Trial
Screening and Accrual Log entries from geographically,

Racial/Ethnic Differences in Cancer CTs/Langford et al

racially, and ethnically diverse patients from 29 cancer
centers in the NCCCP, with race and ethnicity percentages of the logs mimicking the 2010 Census data.27 Continual assessment and monitoring of sites’ CT accrual via
the logs provided a rich data set to evaluate the impact of
race/ethnicity on different aspects of CT participation. It
is possible that this consistent tracking of CT trends was
an important factor in equivalent participation among
whites and blacks in particular. More work is needed to
intervene early with patients having comorbid conditions
and other under-represented groups in cancer CTs to
maximize participation.
Limitations of this study include differences in how
the log was implemented at each site. For example, some
sites were more consistent than others with regard to filling out the log and entering data to the NCI online
reporting tool. In addition, the log was revised over time
to improve usability and to reduce the time burden for
staff, thus earlier versions may have had more incomplete,
inconsistent, or written in log entries that were later reclassified for analysis by log administrators. Even though each
trial had specific screening criteria to help guide providers
in identifying eligible patients, it is possible that some eligible patients were never identified and captured on the
log; thus, the true number of potentially eligible patients
is not known and may have biased the results. Moreover,
there was some missing data for race/ethnicity (13% of
all logs) and a limited number of Hispanic patients, which
may have biased the results and limited our ability to generalize the findings.
Although we did not fully explore physician characteristics and patient CT participation, the primary reasons
that MDs declined offering a CT to an eligible patient
were preference for standard of care and concerns about
the patient’s ability to tolerate a CT due comorbidities/
frailty. It should be noted that we did not have objective
measures to confirm if such concerns were valid (eg, if a
patient was actually too ill to participate in a trial), as all
log data were self-report and completed by a member of
the study team. Future work should explore how, if at all,
physician preference impacts a patient’s decision to enroll
into a CT, the physician’s reasons for not offering CTs to
eligible patients (eg, preference for standard treatment),
and whether a patient’s race/ethnicity influences patientprovider communications about CTs and other treatment
options.
Conclusions

In summary, there were no racial/ethnic differences
among eligible patients in CT enrollment, refusal rates, or
Cancer

“no desire to participate in research” as the reason given
for CT refusal within NCCCP’s Clinical Trial Screening
and Accrual Log data set. However, higher odds of physical/medical conditions were associated with older age,
males, and non-Hispanic blacks. Future work should
examine the role of demographics and consent form characteristics on CT participation. In particular, the role of
comorbidities warrants more attention, especially with
regard to minorities. Future work should explore how better management of a patient’s health before a cancer diagnosis (through primary care), as well as improved
management of these conditions during cancer treatment
will impact the future pool of eligible patients. Also, it is
possible that more phase 4 trials are needed to evaluate
how FDA-approved cancer therapies are tolerated over
time in patients with cancer and comorbidities. A better
understanding of these issues may inform future CT
recruitment, retention, and communication strategies.
