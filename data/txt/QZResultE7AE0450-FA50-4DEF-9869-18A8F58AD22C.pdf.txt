BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study was the investigation of the value of bevacizumab þ 5-fluorouracil(5–FU)/folinic acid in patients with advanced colorectal cancers who have exhausted standard
chemotherapy options. METHODS: The authors included 48 heavily pretreated patients (colon:rectum,
33:15; men:women, 23:25; median age, 63 years; range, 27-79 years) whose disease had progressed during
or within an oxaliplatin-based first-line chemotherapy, an irinotecan-based second-line regimen, and a
third-line treatment with cetuximab plus weekly irinotecan. Bevacizumab was given at a dose of 5 mg/kg.
5-FU/folinic acid was administered according to the de Gramont schedule. RESULTS: The response rate
was 6.25%, and 30.4% of patients demonstrated stable disease as the best response. The median time to
disease progression was 3.5 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.3-6.9 months), and the median
survival time was 7.7 months (95% CI, 3.9-11.9 months). The most common grade 3 to 4 side toxicities
(graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]) were: diarrhea
(20.8%), fatigue (14.5%), and stomatitis (12.5%). Grade 3 to 4 hemorrhage occurred in 8 patients (16.6%),
including 4 cases of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. Other relatively common adverse events such as
hypertension, thrombosis, and bowel perforation were reported in 50%, 18.7%, and 4.16%, of patients
respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study suggest a modest but significant clinical
benefit of bevacizumab þ de Gramont schedule in heavily pretreated colorectal cancer patients. Cancer

monoclonal antibody (MoAb) targeting the VEGF signaling pathway and the only 1 currently approved for use in
the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC).
A randomized phase 2 trial (AVF0780) investigated
the safety and efficacy of 2 dose levels of bevacizumab in
combination with 5-fluorouracil (5–FU)/leucovorin in
patients with MCRC.2
The 2 treatment arms that included bevacizumab (at
doses of 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, respectively) resulted in
higher risk ratios (40% and 24%, respectively) and a longer median time to disease progression (9 months and
7.2 months, respectively) and median overall survival
(OS) (21.5 months and 16.1 months, respectively) compared with the control arm comprised of 5-FU/leucovorin
alone (5.2 months and 13.6 months, respectively).
However, because higher clinical efficacy was noted
in the 5-mg/kg arm compared with the 10-mg/kg arm,
the 5-mg/kg dose of bevacizumab was chosen for further
clinical study. Although bevacizumab was generally well
tolerated, this trial identified several important safety signals, including an increased incidence of thromboembolic
complications, hypertension, proteinuria, bleeding complications in the form of epistaxis, headache, fever, and
rash. In general, however, these adverse events were either
clinically insignificant or were easily managed.
Some phase 3 trials have confirmed the preliminary
efficacy data published by Kabbinavar et al.2
In a pivotal randomized phase 3 study, previously
untreated patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC)
who received bevacizumab and weekly irinotecan plus
bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (IFL) regimen had longer
progression-free survival (PFS) (10.6 months vs 6.2
months; P < .00001) and survived significantly longer
(20.3 months vs 15.6 months; P ¼ .00003) than those
receiving IFL chemotherapy alone plus placebo.3 The
only adverse event that occurred with greater frequency
with the anti-VEGF regimen was grade 3 (graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
Criteria [version 2.0]) hypertension, which was managed
effectively with oral medications.
In addition to being combined with either 5-FU/
leucovorin or the bolus weekly IFL schedule, bevacizumab
has been studied with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in
the second-line setting. In the study published by Giantonio et al, patients with advanced CRC, who were previously treated with 5-FU—based therapy and irinotecan
4850

for advanced or recurrent disease after adjuvant chemotherapy, were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms,
including FOLFOX-4, FOLFOX-4 and bevacizumab,
and bevacizumab alone.4
The results of this trial demonstrated that the addition
of bevacizumab to oxaliplatin, 5–FU, and leucovorin
improves the duration of survival for patients with previously
treated MCRC that was refractory to irinotecan-based chemotherapy. In contrast to the randomized first-line trial, Chen
et al failed to demonstrate any benefit in terms of response
rate, finding that the association of bevacizumab and 5-FU/
leucovorin was associated with rare objective responses.5
The main purpose of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the association of bevacizumab and 5-FU/folinic acid in an extremely pretreated but
homogeneous population of CRC patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We considered patients eligible if they were aged >18 years
and had stage IV, histologically confirmed, colorectal adenocarcinoma (grading determined according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system).
Other criteria for eligibility were: an Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance staus of
<2 and adequate hematologic function (hemoglobin of
>9 g/dL, neutrophil count of >1500/mm3, and platelet
count of >100,000/mm3), renal function (serum creatinine <1.5 times the upper limit of normal), and liver
function (total bilirubin <1.5 times the upper limit of
normal range; aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
aminotransferase <5 times the upper limit of normal).
To be eligible, patients must also have previously
received 1 oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimen (capecitabine þ oxaliplatin or FOLFOX IV regimen) and 1 irinotecan-based chemotherapy (leucovorin, 5-FU, and
irinotecan [FOLFIRI] regimen or irinotecan alone) for at
least 2 months. All patients were included if progression
of disease was documented during receipt of these regimens or within 3 months thereafter.
The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) regimen
was administered as follows: oxaliplatin at a dose of
70 mg/m2 as continuous infusion for 12 hours (8:00 AM
to 8:00 PM) on Days 1 and 8 plus chronomodulated
Cancer

capecitabine at a dose of 1750 mg/m2/day orally (8:00
AM: 25% of total dose; 6:00 PM: 25% of total dose; and
11:00 PM: 50% of total dose) on Days 1 through 14 every
21 days.6
FOLFOX IV consisted of leucovorin (200 mg/m2/
d) followed by a 5-FU bolus (400 mg/m2/d) and 22-hour
infusion (600 mg/m2/d) for 2 consecutive days every
2 weeks with oxaliplatin at a dose of 85 mg/m2 as a 2-hour
infusion on Day 1.7
FOLFIRI consisted of irinotecan at a dose of 180
mg/m2 as a 90-minute infusion on Day 1 and leucovorin
at a dose of 400 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion during irinotecan therapy, immediately followed by a 5-FU bolus of
400 mg/m2 and 46-hour continuous infusion of 2.4 to
3 g/m2 every 2 weeks.8
Three-weekly irinotecan was comprised of irinotecan at a dose of 350 mg/m2. Finally, after progression to
and an oxaliplatin-based and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, all patients were treated with cetuximab plus weekly
irinotecan according to the following schedule: cetuximab
was given at an initial dose of 400 mg/m2, followed by
weekly infusions of 250 mg/m2, and irinotecan was
administered weekly at the dose of 90 mg/m2.9
Disease progression was documented by computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
At least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion was
required. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
expression in the primary tumor or in at least 1 metastatic
lesion was performed. All the patients signed a consent
form.

Study Design and Treatment
The current study was a single-center, phase 2 trial conducted from March 2004 to February 2006. Bevacizumab
was given at the dose of 5 mg/kg. De Gramont chemotherapy was comprised of folinic acid (200 mg/m2/d) followed by a 5-FU bolus (400 mg/m2/d) and 22-hour
infusion (600 mg/m2/d) for 2 consecutive days every
2 weeks.
Dexamethasone was given at the dose of 16 mg
before each course. A standard antiemetic drug was always
given in the premedication and in the following days, at
the physician’s discretion. All the patients were to be
treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxic

effects occurred. In the case of disease progression, further
anticancer treatments were allowed.
Tumor response was evaluated every 8 weeks with
the use of consistent imaging techniques (CT or MRI).
Assessment was performed by the investigators, who
used Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST).10
Toxic effects were assessed according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0).
Modifications of bevacizumab dose were not
planned, and the drug was stopped if grade 3 to 4 adverse
events possibly related to bevacizumab were recorded.
Modifications in the doses of the de Gramont regimen
were made in cases of hematologic or nonhematologic
toxic effects.
The present trial was approved by the institutional
review board of our institution, and written informed
consent was obtained from all participating patients.

Statistical Plan and Analysis
This study used Simon’s Minimax 2-stage design11 to test
the null hypothesis that the true overall response rate was
5% (which would not be clinically meaningful), as
opposed to the alternative hypothesis that the true overall
response rate was 10%. Up to 33 patients were planned
for each cohort to assess the overall response rate with
85% power and a ¼ .05. If 2 objective tumor responses
were observed in the cohort, an additional 15 patients
would be enrolled onto that cohort in stage 2.
The primary endpoint was the rate of confirmed
radiologic tumor response, as assessed by a local committee, in the intent-to-treat population. Secondary endpoints were the evaluation of time to disease progression,
OS, safety profile, and the median time to response. All
analyses were performed following an intent–to–treat
analysis method. The time to disease progression was calculated as the period from the date of the initiation of
treatment to the first observation of disease progression or
to death from any cause within 60 days after the initiation
of treatment or the most recent tumor assessment. The
OS time was calculated as the period from the date treatment was initiated until death from any cause or until the
date of the last follow-up, at which point data were censored. Time to disease progression and OS were both

determined by the Kaplan-Meier product-limit
method.12
The difference in terms of time to disease progression and OS according to anticancer treatment delays or
termination was evaluated by the log-rank test.13
The cutoff point for survival data was July 2007; for
safety data, it was July 2006. SPSS statistical software (version 14.00; SPSS, Chicago, Ill) was used for statistical
analysis. A P value of <.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

RESULTS
Between March 2004 and February 2006, 48 consecutive
patients were enrolled in this single-center phase 2 trial.
The main characteristics of the patient population are
summarized in Table 1. The median number of courses
administered was 5 (range, 2-13 courses). Forty-six
patients were evaluated for the declared study efficacy
endpoints and 48 for the safety analysis.

Efficacy Analysis
For the intent-to-treat analysis, 46 patients were evaluated
for efficacy (2 patients were removed from the study early
because the patients refused to continue anticancer therapy and were not evaluable for both time to disease progression and OS). The best objective responses were
achieved as follows: 0 (0%) complete responses, 3 (6.5%;
95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.9-6.5%) partial
responses, 14 (30.4%; 95% CI, 22.5-41.7%) cases of stable disease, and 30 (65.2%; 95% CI, 44.7-71.8%) instances of disease progression. Therefore, the overall response
rate was 6.5% (95% CI, 4.3-10.4%), and the disease control rate (partial response þ stable disease) was 36.9%
(95% CI, 25.8-44.8%). The median time to disease progression was 3.5 months (95% CI, 2.3-6.9 months), and
the median OS time was 7.7 months (95% CI, 3.9-11.9
months).
No patients received any further anticancer treatment after they withdrew from therapy for disease
progression.
Comparing patients with an ECOG performance
status of 2 (25% of the total study population) with the
others revealed no differences in terms of response rate.
However, a slight but significant difference in terms of

time to disease progression (2.6 months vs 3.8 months; P

noted.
Moreover, we compared patients defined as responders to at least 1 (first–line, second–line, or third–
line) anticancer treatment (39 patients) with nonresponders (7 patients), and did not identify any differences with
regard to response rate, time to disease progression, or OS
(data not shown).

Adverse Events
All patients were evaluated for safety analysis. Leukopenia
and neutropenia were the most common hematologic toxicities, with an incidence of 54.1% and 64.5%, respectively. However, grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was recorded
only in 6 patients (12.5%), and it did not cause any dose
reductions or treatment discontinuation. No patients

required the administration of granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor to recover after a neutropenic event. In
2 patients, neutropenic fever required hospitalization and
infusion of antibiotics.
The most common nonhematologic toxicities were
diarrhea (grade 3-4 in 20.8% of patients), fatigue (grade
3-4 in 14.5% of patients), and oral mucositis (grade 3-4
in 12.5% of patients). Safety results are summarized in
Table 2.
Overall, 21 patients experienced a delay or change in
dosing (of 5-FU) as a result of adverse events during the
study. In particular, treatment was delayed in 10 patients
because of bevacizumab-related toxicities, and the 5-FU
dose was reduced or treatment delayed in 11 patients
because of 5-FU–related toxicities.
Because of nonhematologic toxicities, the 5-FU
dose was reduced (25% dose reduction) in 9 patients
(18.7%). Because of the persistence of diarrhea in 2 of the
9 patients, 5-FU was discontinued, and treatment was
continued with bevacizumab only. In only 2 patients, the
5-FU dose was reduced for neutropenic fever.
Grade 3 to 4 hemorrhage was reported in 8 patients
(16.6%), with 4 events (8.3%) occurring in the gastrointestinal tract. The rate of venous thrombosis was 18.7%,
with 3 (6.2%) cases of pulmonary thromboembolism
reported; in all 3 cases, hospitalization was required withCancer

related to bevacizumab are summarized in Table 3.
Bowel perforation was rare (2 patients). In 1 patient,
bowel perforation was diagnosed by a leak of oral contrast
into the pelvis after a standard CT scan performed to
restage disease after 2 months of treatment, but the perforation appeared to be contained and treated with intravenous antibiotics. In 3 cases, grade 3 to 4 fistulas were
identified, with 1 fatal outcome after a surgical procedure
needed to evacuate a local abdominal abscess (because of
the urgency of the intervention, the interval between the
last bevacizumab administration and surgery was inadequate: only 2 weeks). In the other 2 cases, surgery for the
drainage of a pelvic abscess was required, with complete
resolution of the clinical presentation after 35 days and 45
days, respectively.
Other than the previously mentioned 2 patients
who decided to withdraw from therapy, only 4 patients
were excluded from the study because of toxicity (the 2
patients who developed bowel perforations and 2 patients
who developed fistulas).
Comparing patients with an ECOG performance
status of2 (25% of our total population) with the remaining patient population revealed no significant differences
with regard to the incidence of adverse events.

Influence of Dose Reduction/Delay of
Treatment on Anticancer Efficacy
As stated earlier, a reduction of dose or a delay was
required in 21 patients during treatment. We analyzed the
efficacy of treatment in this subgroup, comparing it with
the efficacy in the group of patients who better tolerated
treatment. The response rate in the group with a treatment delay or change in dosing was lower than in the
group without (19.04% vs 50%, respectively). This difference was statistically significant, with a P value of .046.
Furthermore, a statistically significant difference also was
recorded in terms of time to disease progression, with a
median time to disease progression in the group of
patients who required a treatment delay or change in dosing of 2 months versus 4 months in the group that did not
(P ¼ .03) (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
The efficacy of oncology drug regimens traditionally has
been assessed by their potency to shrink existing tumors
and, ideally, to prolong PFS and OS. Tumor response can
be easily evaluated in small trials, and data from small trials may provide early evidence that an investigational
agent warrants further testing. In clinical practice, the observation of a tumor response reassures the patient and the
oncologist that the selected therapy is active in the malignant disease. The common use of tumor response criteria
as a measure of efficacy in CRC has persisted despite multiple analyses demonstrating a weak correlation between
tumor response and OS.14
4854

This concept is supported even more by the introduction into oncology of novel drugs without intrinsic
direct cytotoxic activity, such as antiangiogenic agents,
suggesting that tumor response could be re-evaluated as a
key marker of efficacy in patients with CRC.15
This theory is supported by the recent article by
Grothey et al,15 in which the authors evaluated the survival benefit, both in terms of PFS and OS, associated
with tumor response in 2 clinical trials, 1 containing bevacizumab in the experimental arm3 and 1 that did not.16
By this analysis, the authors clearly demonstrated
that even patients with advanced CRC who did not
achieve a response according to traditional criteria significantly benefited from being treated with the superior regimen and had the same magnitude of benefit as
responders, regardless of whether this regimen was chemotherapy alone or included the antiangiogenic agent
bevacizumab.
All these data support the hypothesis that disease
control may be translated into survival benefit, even if
patients in an experimental arm do not demonstrate an
increase in response rate.
The data presented in the current trial indicate that
treating heavily resistant CRC patients may be possible
without severe toxicities, even if some secondary effects
possibly related to bevacizumab have been recorded. This
result is very interesting in particular because, to the best
of our knowledge, the current study is the first to be
performed in a population of patients treated with irinotecan-based, oxaliplatin-based, and cetuximab-based anticancer agents. Moreover, the identification of a disease
Cancer

Bevacizumab þ de Gramont in CRC Patients/Vincenzi et al

control rate of 36.9% appears to suggest some anticancer
activity in this very heavily pretreated population. However, we must note that, to the best of our knowledge, no
data from randomized clinical trials are actually available
regarding the potential role of bevacizumab-based anticancer therapy in such a population and, most likely even
more important, there are no data regarding quality of life
in patients receiving this treatment versus patients who
do not.
The key finding in this trial is that introducing a
bevacizumab-based therapy in a very late phase of therapy
in CRC patients may yet play a role in contributing to tumor control.
Moreover, the use of bevacizumab plus the de
Gramont schedule as fourth-line therapy (as first bevacizumab use) could be reserved for patients for whom antiangiogenic therapy has previously been contraindicated
for different reasons (such as instable blood hypertension,
a recent episode of arterial thromboembolism, recent episode of bleeding, or recent bowel perforation).Once these
contraindications have been resolved or stabilized, these
patients may yet benefit from bevacizumab-based therapy.
Moreover, there is a substantial difference reported by
Chen et al5; in the current study, all patients had been previously treated with an additional third-line therapy
(cetuximab-based therapy). This is a clear demonstration
that bevacizumab-based therapy can produce an interesting rate of disease control, time to disease progression,
and OS when administered to patients refractory to antiEGFR MoAb therapy.
Preclinical studies have demonstrated that a murine
MoAb against VEGF can inhibit the growth of human tumor xenografts when given alone or with chemotherapy.17,18 A humanized variant of this antibody
(bevacizumab) has clinical activity in human cancer and
increases survival when added to standard chemotherapy
in patients with MCRC.3
Mice who received active antibody demonstrated a
90% reduction in tumor volume at the highest dose.
These findings correspond well with the paradigm that
tumors require neovascularization for growth.19
A consequence of this biologic action of VEGF in
vivo could be that the blockage of VEGF-dependent
angiogenesis leads to prolonged disease control in cancers
of different histologies. On this basis, we found the rationale to propose to our heavily treated patients a palliative
Cancer

therapy containing bevacizumab. Clearly, we understand
that such treatment may be related to a significant increase
in cost in this patient population. Therefore, a detailed
cost analysis of bevacizumab-based anticancer treatment
in heavily pretreated CRC patients could be very useful
for understanding the economic impact of this treatment.
Moreover, the safety profile also needs to be considered.
The incidence of grade 3 to 4 hypertension in the phase 3
study of patients receiving bevacizumab plus chemotherapy as first-line anticancer therapy for advanced CRC by
Hurwitz et al was 11%.3 Consequently, the incidence of
this side effect overlapped the incidence reported in previous first-line clinical trials. The incidence of grade 3 to 4
hemorrhage was noted in 16% of patients in the current
study versus 5% for the study by Chen et al5; this discrepancy could be, at least partially, ascribed to the finding
that patients in the current study were more heavily
pretreated.
One of the main concerns in this trial is represented
by the percentage of patients who went on to receive
fourth-line chemotherapy. According the results of the
Medical Research Council FOCUS trial, approximately
24% to 27% of patients with metastatic CRC receive
third or further lines of chemotherapy.20 Considering the
relatively recent introduction of biologic agents in the
treatment of this patient population, this percentage is
destined to increase in the coming years.
In conclusion, to our knowledge, the current study
is the first to demonstrate some anticancer activity of bevacizumab þ de Gramont schedule in patients who had
received all other anticancer drugs available for the treatment of MCRC, with an acceptable safety profile.
