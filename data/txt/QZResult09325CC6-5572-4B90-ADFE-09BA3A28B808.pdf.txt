Cytokine Stimulation of Epithelial Cancer Cells: The Similar
and Divergent Functions of IL-4 and IL-13
Miranda A. Hallett, Katherine T. Venmar, and Barbara Fingleton

Abstract
The Th2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and -13 are acknowledged regulators of lymphocyte proliferation and
activation. They have also been well studied in the regulation of various myeloid-derived populations in
tumor biology. It has become clear, however, that both cytokines can have direct effects on epithelial tumor
cells expressing appropriate receptors. Changes in tumor proliferation, survival, and metastatic capability
have all been ascribed to IL-4 and/or IL-13 action. Here, we evaluate the evidence to support direct tumorpromoting roles of these cytokines. We also identify the questions that should be addressed before
proceeding with therapeutic approaches based on neutralization of IL-4 or IL-13 pathways. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Cancer cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis are inﬂuenced by multiple factors including cytokines in the tumor
microenvironment interacting with cells and regulating complex signaling pathways. Two such cytokines are the Th2
molecules, interleukin (IL)-4 and -13. IL-4 and IL-13 are
structurally similar multifunctional peptides that can affect
multiple cell types. IL-4 is a well-characterized regulator of
proliferation and immunoglobulin class switching in B cells,
and IL-13 stimulates changes in epithelial and smooth muscle
cell functions leading to hypersensitivity reactions (1–3). These
immunoregulating and effector cytokines are produced by
macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, natural killer T-cells
(NKT), natural killer (NK) cells, basophils, eosinophils, and T
lymphocytes (4). As depicted in Fig. 1A, there are 4 different
receptor subunits associated with these cytokines that can
combine in different ways to generate various functional units.
When IL-4 binds IL-4Ra with high afﬁnity, resultant heterodimerization with either the g-common chain (gC) forms the
type I IL-4R or with the IL-13 receptor a-1 (IL-13Ra1) forms the
type II IL-4R (1, 3). The type II IL-4R can also be generated by
binding of IL-13 to IL-13Ra1 and subsequent heterodimerization with IL-4Ra (2, 3). The type I IL-4R complex is present on
lymphoid T and NK cells, basophils, mast cells, and most
mouse B cells, whereas type II IL-4R is found on nonlymphoid
and tumor cells (2, 4). Although both cytokines can, thus, signal
through the same receptor complex (type II IL-4R), they do not
seem to always activate identical signaling pathways (2, 5).

Another receptor that is expressed and activated on tumor
cells is IL-13Ra2. IL-13 binds IL-13Ra2, which is distinct from
IL-13Ra1 and is present in 2 forms. A soluble form resulting
from either alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage has no
signaling ability and has been called the decoy receptor (2),
whereas a larger membrane-spanning form results in the
activation of downstream effectors.
High levels of Th2 cytokines are observed in the tumor
microenvironment and peripheral blood of patients with prostate, bladder, and breast cancers (6–8). Several reports indicate
that the type II IL-4R (IL-4Ra and IL-13Ra1 chains) is upregulated and activated in various epithelial tumor types including malignant glioma, ovarian, lung, breast, pancreas, and
colon carcinomas (9, 10). However, the expression and activation of the type I IL-4R (IL-4Ra and gC chains) remains to be
examined in these tumor types. IL-13Ra2 is expressed in colon,
pancreatic, and ovarian tumors and in malignant glioma (11–
14). In summary then, both ligands and receptors are present in
many tumor types and their interaction may have important
consequences. Here, we focus on the direct effects of IL-4 and
IL-13 on epithelial tumor cells. Other protumorigenic functions, including roles as activators of tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are
described elsewhere (15). Because IL-4, in particular, is an
important regulator of lymphocyte expansion and function (2),
it is possible that some adaptive antitumor functions can also
be related to this cytokine system. While this is largely outside
the scope of the present article, it is an important issue when
considering therapeutic interventions and will be touched on
in the ﬁnal section.
IL-4 and the type II IL-4 receptor
The IL-4/IL-4Ra interaction on epithelial cancer cells supports tumor growth in vivo in part by mediating resistance to
apoptosis. Epithelial cancers are often cross-resistant to both
intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways as they have a
common downstream effector protein, caspase-3. While
TRAIL and other death ligands activate the extrinsic pathway

Figure 1. A, receptors for IL-4 and IL-13 are composed of 4 different subunits, IL-4Ra (green), g-chain (gc; purple), IL-13Ra1 (red), and IL-13Ra2 (yellow). IL-4
and IL-13 both bind and signal through type II IL-4R. Type II IL-4R and IL-13Ra2 are present on tumor cells. B, in the presence of al signaling receptors, IL-4 and
IL-13 can both bind type II IL-4R and phosphorylate Stat6, leading to increased proliferation and apoptotic resistance. JNK/MAPK and p38 pathways
are also activated downstream of IL-4, and possibly IL-13 signaling, through type II IL-4R. IL-13 can also bind soluble or transmembrane IL-13Ra2, potentially
leading to induction of TGF-b expression, downstream of ERK 1/2 and AP-1.  , note this pathway has thus far only been delineated in other cell types,
but is speculated to occur in epithelial cancer cells. C, in the absence of IL-13Ra2, IL-13 may have enhanced signaling through type II IL-4R and/or signaling
resulting in expression of 15-LOX-1.

of apoptosis, chemotherapeutic agents typically activate the
intrinsic pathway. To examine the ability of IL-4 to protect
against death ligand-induced apoptosis, Todaro and colleagues treated subcutaneous human colon and breast tumors in
mice with an IL-4–neutralizing antibody and TRAIL. Treatment with the antibody alone modestly decreased the growth
of breast and colon tumors, but strongly sensitized tumors to
cotreatment with TRAIL. Reduction in tumor growth was
attributed to the downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins
PED, cFLIP, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2 in response to IL-4 blockade (9).
This study and others have used the species speciﬁcity of IL-4/
IL-4Ra binding to target the autocrine production of human
IL-4 in mouse xenograft models. However, distinguishing the
actions of autocrine versus paracrine IL-4 is less relevant in
patients where both act similarly. Nonetheless, xenograft
models have been instrumental in showing that IL-4 enhances
the survival of epithelial cancer cells.

To establish IL-4 as a survival factor capable of inducing
chemoresistance, Todaro and colleagues implanted human
colorectal cancer spheroids containing colorectal cancer stem
cells into the ﬂanks of nude mice. Mice bearing colorectal
tumors were treated with an anti-human IL-4–neutralizing
antibody or IL-4 double "mutein" (IL-4DM), an antagonist of
human IL-4Ra, to interfere with the IL-4/IL-4Ra interaction
(16). A modest decrease in tumor size compared with controls
was seen with either treatment alone. However, efﬁcacy of
chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and/or 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU)
was signiﬁcantly enhanced when animals were cotreated with
either the anti-IL-4 antibody or IL-4DM. Furthermore, these
antitumor effects were sustained following cessation of treatment. Increased tumor cell death was again attributed to the
downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins PED, cFLIP, Bcl-xL,
Bcl-2 (16), and survivin expression (9) following IL-4 blockade.

chemoresistance in epithelial tumors in vivo, it follows that
anti-IL-4/IL-4Ra treatments in combination with standard
chemotherapeutics could have a synergistic effect in reducing
tumor growth in patients. Because IL-4 levels are often elevated
in the tumor microenvironment (8–10), anti-IL-4/IL-4Ra treatment may be even more potent in patients as total IL-4, both
autocrine and paracrine, would be neutralized.
In addition to enhancing cancer cell survival for tumor
growth, IL-4 has been shown to directly induce the rate of
proliferation of colon, breast, head and neck, ovarian, and
prostate cancer cells in vitro (4, 17, 18). The majority of these
studies attributed IL-4–induced proliferation to the activation
of downstream Stat6 signaling; however, the upregulation of
survivin may also play a role. Survivin, a well-known inhibitor
of apoptosis, can act as a mitotic regulator that directly
inﬂuences cell proliferation by controlling cell-cycle entry
(19). In a recent study, IL-4–induced proliferation of human
prostate cancer cells correlated with increased expression of
survivin in vitro. This ﬁnding translated to increased tumor cell
proliferation in vivo, overall tumor progression, and increased
mouse survival (18). Signiﬁcantly, survivin mRNA levels did not
differ between control and IL-4–stimulated prostate cancer
cells, indicating that survivin upregulation was not controlled
by a transcriptional mechanism, but rather by differences in
mRNA translation (18). In contrast to proliferation-promoting
roles, early in vitro models deﬁned a possible growth inhibitory
role for IL-4 that was also shown in vivo using tumor cells
genetically modiﬁed to secrete IL-4 (20). However, it is important to note that, in such experiments, cancer cell IL-4 expression was driven by viral promoters resulting in consistent and
copious overexpression that may not have been physiologically
relevant. Importantly, clinical trials in which exogenous IL-4
was tested as an antitumor agent were not successful (20).
Because we now know that IL-4 levels are often already
elevated in the tumor microenvironment of patients with
cancer (6–8), the lack of effect of additional IL-4 is perhaps
not unsurprising.
Although the earlier studies examined the role of autocrine
IL-4 in the growth of established epithelial tumors, the IL-4/IL4Ra interaction may also contribute to tumor formation.
Khaled and colleagues recently published that IL-4- and IL13–induced Stat6 signaling is crucial for normal mammary
gland development in vivo (21). It is plausible that epithelial
tumor cells could exploit normal developmental pathways to
promote tumor formation. Consistent with the studies in
established tumors, IL-4 has been shown to promote ﬁbrosarcoma tumor formation in vivo by enhancing tumor cell survival
(22). However, the relative contribution of tumor- versus hostderived IL-4 or the receptor was not examined in this study.
This is signiﬁcant because several cell types may contribute to
IL-4/IL-4Ra–induced proliferation and survival during epithelial tumor development. For example, as reviewed elsewhere
(15), tumor-promoting macrophages can be activated by IL-4.
In an attempt to distinguish the contribution of epithelial
versus host IL-4Ra signaling in tumor development, Koller and
colleagues used 2 mouse models: (i) implantation of wild-type
murine colon cancer cells or short hairpin RNA (shRNA)mediated IL-4Ra knockdown (IL-4Ra KD) clones into the ceca

6340

Cancer Res; 72(24) December 15, 2012

of C57BL/6 mice; and (ii) a carcinogen-induced model of
colitis-associated colon cancer in IL-4Ra knockout (IL4Ra / ) mice (4). Results obtained from the implantation
model indicated that tumor cell IL-4Ra was important for
inducing proliferation but not survival in vivo. In the carcinogen model, IL-4Ra / mice had signiﬁcantly smaller tumors
compared with wild-type mice. The reduction in tumor size
correlated with a trend in decreased proliferation and a
signiﬁcant increase in apoptosis, suggesting that cell death
was mediated by host-cell IL-4Ra (4). However, because both
host and tumor cells were deﬁcient of IL-4Ra in the carcinogen-induced model, it is impossible to be certain of the
relative contribution of each. These results established a role
for IL-4Ra in promoting colon cancer development, yet they
seem to contradict previous studies showing a strong prosurvival function of the IL-4/IL-4Ra interaction in epithelial
tumor cells (9, 16, 18, 22). It is important to note that active
survival-response pathways in developing compared with
established tumors may differ. Other variables include colon
cancer stem cell content as well as the presence and function of
IL-13. It is also possible that in the colitis-associated colon
cancer model, increased production of IL-13 by inﬂammatory
cells in the tumor microenvironment may promote tumor
development as IL-13 can also bind and activate IL-4Ra. The
contribution of each cytokine remains to be distinguished, and
this may be particularly important in models where immune
inﬁltrates are prevalent.
IL-13 and its receptors
Numerous studies have reported the expression and role of
IL-4 in epithelial cancers; however, few have also focused on the
implications of IL-13 and IL-13R expression. This gap in
knowledge may be due to the complexity of the IL-13 system.
IL-13 can signal through type II IL-4R (IL-4Ra and IL-13Ra1) or
through IL-13Ra2, which was earlier believed to serve only as a
decoy receptor. Elevated levels of IL-13 were detected in
primary breast cancer tumor tissue (23) and in the peripheral
blood of 131 other patients with cancer (pancreatic, esophageal, and gastric) when compared with healthy controls (24).
Recent studies by Formentini and colleagues and Barderas and
colleagues suggested possible roles for IL-13 and its receptors
IL-13Ra1 and IL-13Ra2 in colorectal cancer (11, 25). In tumor
tissue specimens, expression of IL-13Ra1 did not inﬂuence
survival and IL-13 expression did not inﬂuence patient lymph
node metastasis. Surprisingly, low IL-13 expression correlated
with worse overall survival compared with high IL-13 expression (25). However, high expression of IL-13Ra2 in patients
with colon cancer is a predictor of later stages of disease and
poor outcome (11). Similarly, in highly invasive glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM), IL-13Ra2 is overexpressed, whereas it is
absent in normal brain tissue (13). Finally, IL-13Ra2 has been
reported to be a biomarker of disease in ovarian cancer and
targeting this receptor with a speciﬁc immunotoxin in mice
resulted in decreased tumor burden and extended host survival
(14). Although these expression ﬁndings suggest a possible
contribution of IL-13Ra2 to tumor metastasis and survival,
they do not establish a causal role for IL-13 in cancer cell
growth or metastasis.

Functions of IL-4 and IL-13 in Cancer Cells

To establish functional relationships between IL-13 and
tumor behavior, it is helpful to understand the various signaling pathways associated with receptor activation. The dominant signaling pathway activated by IL-13 binding to IL-13Ra1
in the context of the type II IL-4R, is the Stat6 pathway (Fig. 1B;
ref. 2). This is the same pathway activated by IL-4 binding to the
type II IL-4R, although signaling kinetics seem to be different
(3). In many of the studies discussed previously, IL-4Ra was
targeted to abolish IL-4 binding and resultant signaling. This
does not affect IL-13 binding to IL-13Ra1, but in the absence of
IL-4Ra, signaling is eliminated. Several studies identifying the
role of IL-4R in tumorigenesis have assumed that the response
is equal regardless of which cytokine, IL-4 or IL-13, is activating
the signaling cascade. This, however, may be inaccurate (3) and
further studies isolating the signaling pathways activated
downstream of each cytokine are required. Additional mediators in tumorigenesis may include AP-1-dependent induction
of TGF-b expression after IL-13 binding to IL-13Ra2, as shown
in macrophages (Fig. 1B; ref. 26). Another mediator is 15lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1), which conversely occurs only in
the absence of IL-13Ra2 (Fig. 1C; ref. 27).
A correlation between IL-13Ra2 expression and metastasis
of tumor cells has been observed in multiple epithelial cancers.
In an orthotopic model of human ovarian cancer, IL-13Ra2–
expressing tumors metastasized to lymph nodes faster than IL13Ra2–negative tumors and resulted in a higher rate of animal
mortality (14). Exogenous IL-13 treatment further increased
mortality in mice carrying IL-13Ra2–expressing tumors (14),
linking IL-13/IL-13Ra2 to increased aggressiveness of tumor
cells. Similarly, overexpression of IL-13Ra2 increased invasion
and metastasis, and decreased survival in a mouse model of
human pancreatic cancer (12). Recent studies in a mouse
model of human colorectal cancer indicated that genetic
knockdown of IL-13Ra2 in tumor cells reduced liver homing
ability, resulting in increased survival of mice compared with
those injected with IL-13Ra2–expressing cells (11). In addition,
in mouse models of GBM, tumor cells that survive IL-13Ra2
targeted therapy, presumably due to low receptor expression,
were less tumorigenic than untreated control cells (13). Possible molecular mediators of this prometastastic function of IL13 include the transcription factor AP-1 and its target TGF-b.
Treatment of IL-13Ra2–expressing tumor cells with exogenous IL-13 activated ERK1/2 followed by AP-1, in vitro, with
expression conﬁrmed in vivo (14). AP-1 is at least one of the
transcription factors downstream of IL-13Ra2 signaling leading to expression of TGF-b in monocytic leukemia and macrophages as a result of IL-13 treatment (26). Therefore, we
speculate this pathway may also be important in epithelial
tumor cells.
Another important mechanism for promotion of metastasis
is regulation of apoptosis. Interestingly, IL-13 can be both proand antiapoptotic depending on receptor presence and/or the
signaling pathways activated. As described previously, signaling through type II IL-4R is strongly associated with increased
expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. The IL-13–induced
proapoptotic pathway is activated by 15-LOX-1 catalyzing the
oxidation of arachidonic and linoleic acids, leading to activation of PPARg, whose ligands can then activate cell apoptosis.

www.aacrjournals.org

According to Hsi and colleagues, IL-13–dependent production
of 15-LOX-1 occurs only in the absence of IL-13Ra2. In their
model, decreased in vivo growth of GBM due to increased
apoptosis was associated with IL-13 (27). Some researchers
have postulated that this IL-13–induced apoptosis signaling
pathway occurs through IL-4R; however, there have not been
any studies to either support or dispute this contention.
These multiple studies established contradictory roles for
IL-13 in promoting and combating cancer progression that is
seemingly dependent on receptor expression. For example,
when all receptors are expressed, IL-13 can: (i) bind to IL13Ra1, recruit IL-4Ra, and signal through this heterodimer to
phosphorylate stat6 and promote proliferation and/or apoptotic resistance; (ii) bind to soluble IL-13Ra2 decoy receptor
and result in no signaling; or (iii) bind transmembrane monomeric IL-13Ra2 and induce TGF-b, resulting in increased
metastasis (Fig. 1B, C). In addition, in mice genetically deﬁcient
for IL-4Ra, where any IL-13 signaling must be through IL13Ra2, Ko and colleagues showed increased development of
precancerous lesions in an intestinal carcinogen model (28).
These mice also had increased levels of TGF-b. It is important
to note that induction of AP-1 by IL-13 signaling through IL13Ra2 can also activate other factors including matrix metalloproteinases, which are active in tumor growth, invasion, and
metastasis (14). In contrast, in the absence of IL-13Ra2 expression, IL-13 signaling through type II IL-4R is possibly increased
and the IL-13–induced apoptotic pathway is activated,
although it is not yet clear if this IL-13–induced apoptotic
pathway is downstream of type II IL-4R. Overall then, it is clear
that IL-13Ra2–targeted therapy may be just as important as
IL-4Ra–targeted therapy.

Implications and Future Directions
As indicated by the foregoing discussion, there is now
signiﬁcant evidence supporting IL-4/IL-13 and their receptors
as valid therapeutic targets in many different cancers. Even
without considering the biologic pathways involved, the high
level expression of IL-4Ra (also known as CD124) or IL-13Ra2
on several types of tumor cells has allowed tumor cell-selective
delivery of various toxins or lytic peptides, resulting in reduced
tumor load (29). Therefore, is it plausible to target the IL-4R or
IL-13Ra2 signaling pathways in patients as anticancer
therapy? There are several key concerns to address before the
use of anti-IL4 or -13 receptor treatments: (i) IL-4Ra–inhibiting
treatments would inhibit signaling through both type I and II
IL-4Rs. To our knowledge, there are no comprehensive studies
evaluating the expression of type I IL-4R in epithelial cancers.
Type I IL-4R should be ruled out as a potential player in tumor
cell behavior, but is clearly a critical regulator of immune cell
behavior. When given systemically, agents that target IL-4Ra
will affect not only cancer cells but also tumor-associated
macrophages, other myeloid cell types, and lymphocytes. It is
this last group of cells that may be of concern. It is known that
there are polymorphisms in the gene for IL4RA that result in
enhanced receptor activity. Small genetic studies have suggested that patients with colorectal cancer with these polymorphisms actually have a better prognosis (30). This is likely
due to more effective B- and T-cell function, although actual

experimental evidence is lacking. Therefore, therapies that
speciﬁcally target cancer cells via the type II IL-4R, but avoid
the lymphocyte-expressed type I receptor, may be most beneﬁcial; (ii) targeting of 1 receptor type may impact the activity
or ligand-binding of other related receptors. One of the
most exciting recent studies in the IL-4/IL-13 ﬁeld deﬁnes
the crystal structures of the various receptors and shows
IL-4 and IL-13 having different potencies through the same
receptor in tumor cells (3). IL-4 and IL-13 have differing
afﬁnities for the various receptor subunits, which can make
1 or the other receptor the more likely target when all are
available. However, this will be changed if 1 subunit is no
longer able to bind ligand. For example, in the absence of
IL-13Ra2, will there be increased binding of the type II IL-4R
by IL-13 that would have a different outcome to when that
receptor is bound by IL-4? We are currently undertaking
studies using single and dual receptor knockdown in tumor
cells expressing these receptors at various levels to answer
these complex, yet pertinent, questions; and (iii) efﬁcacy
may be different in primary and metastatic tumors. Many
studies have found particularly strong evidence for prosurvival functions of IL-4 and IL-13. This might suggest
that metastatic colonization and resistance to chemotherapy, both dependent on survival programming, are key
roles for IL-4 and IL-13 signaling. In mouse models, we have
preliminary evidence that growth of primary tumors is
unaffected, whereas metastatic burden is strongly reduced

when IL-4Ra is ablated on mammary tumor cells (Venmar
and Fingleton, unpublished data). Further analysis of the
different mechanisms involved will be necessary before
making recommendations about which patient populations would most beneﬁt from IL-4/IL-13 pathway-directed
therapies.
In conclusion, IL-4 and IL-13 as well as their receptors seem
to have signiﬁcant functions on tumor cell biology that is
distinct from their roles in regulation of immune cells.
Although complex and still in need of further elucidation, the
signaling pathways activated by these Th2 cytokines may offer
novel means to target cancer-speciﬁc behaviors.
