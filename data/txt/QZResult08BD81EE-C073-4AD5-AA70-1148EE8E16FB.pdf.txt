Abstract
The short circulating half-life and side effects of IFNα affect its dosing schedule and efficacy. Fusion of IFNα
to a tumor-targeting monoclonal antibody (MAb-IFNα) can enhance potency due to increased tumor localization and improved pharmacokinetics. We report the generation and characterization of the first bispecific
MAb-IFNα, designated 20-C2-2b, which comprises two copies of IFNα2b and a stabilized F(ab)2 of hL243
(humanized anti–HLA-DR; IMMU-114) site-specifically linked to veltuzumab (humanized anti-CD20). In vitro,
20-C2-2b inhibited each of four lymphoma and eight myeloma cell lines, and was more effective than monospecific CD20-targeted MAb-IFNα or a mixture comprising the parental antibodies and IFNα in all but one
(HLA-DR−/CD20−) myeloma line, suggesting that 20-C2-2b should be useful in the treatment of various
hematopoietic malignancies. 20-C2-2b displayed greater cytotoxicity against KMS12-BM (CD20+/HLA-DR+
myeloma) compared with monospecific MAb-IFNα, which targets only HLA-DR or CD20, indicating that all
three components in 20-C2-2b could contribute to toxicity. Our findings indicate that a given cell's responsiveness to MAb-IFNα depends on its sensitivity to IFNα and the specific antibodies, as well as the expression
and density of the targeted antigens. Cancer Res; 70(19); 7600–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
In the United States, there were 65,980 new cases of non–
Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and 19,500 deaths from this disease
in 2009 (1). Approximately half of patients with NHL fail firstline therapy and are rarely cured (2). In addition to NHL, there
were 20,580 new cases and 10,580 deaths from multiple myeloma (MM; ref. 1). The clinical activity of IFNα is established in
NHL therapy (3, 4), and the addition of IFNα to rituximab
immunotherapy has shown some clinical advantage (5, 6).
Available data suggest that progression-free survival of MM
patients is improved with IFNα, but the benefit is small and
its use remains controversial because of toxicity (7). Even
though IFNα can have direct cytotoxic activity on tumors,
inhibit angiogenesis, and stimulate both innate and adaptive
immunity, its efficacy as an anticancer therapeutic has been
limited due to its short circulating half-life and systemic toxicity. Selective delivery using tumor-targeting monoclonal
antibodies (MAb) could improve pharmacokinetics, increase

local concentration, prolong tumor retention, and limit
systemic exposure of IFNα, thereby augmenting its direct
and indirect effects and increasing the therapeutic index.
The Dock-and-Lock (DNL) method is a modular approach
for building multivalent, multispecific, and multifunctional
agents suitable for biomedical applications (8, 9). Previously,
using DNL, we generated a novel immunocytokine named
20-2b-2b, formerly 20-2b, which comprises four IFNα2b
groups tethered to the humanized anti-CD20 MAb, veltuzumab (v-mab), and showed potent in vitro cytotoxicity and superior therapeutic efficacy in human NHL xenograft models
(10). This inspired our hypothesis that an immunocytokine
that targets CD20 and a second highly expressed antigen
on such malignant cells could be even more efficacious.
One such target, HLA-DR, is expressed on many hematopoietic malignancies. IMMU-114 (or hL243γ4p; ref. 11),
which shows potent direct cytotoxicity on NHL in vitro and
in vivo, is a humanized IgG 4 version of L243, a mouse
anti–HLA-DR MAb, which was engineered to prevent the
formation of half-IgG associated with the IgG4 isotype (12).
As an IgG4 variant, the effector functions of IMMU-114,
particularly complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), are
minimized (11).
Herein, we describe the first bispecific MAb-IFNα (20-C22b), which was generated using the DNL method to comprise
v-mab fused to a stabilized hL243 F(ab)2 and dimeric IFNα2b.
We show that 20-C2-2b has potent cytotoxicity against four
NHL cell lines as well as eight MM cell lines, seven of which
express HLA-DR. Because 20-C2-2b has antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), but not CDC, and can target
both CD20 and HLA-DR, it may be useful for therapy of a

cells associated with myeloma, which are resistant to current
therapy regimens and reportedly express CD20.

Daudi, Ramos, Raji, Jeko-1, NCI-H929, and U266 human lymphoma cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection. The sources of MM cell lines are as follows: KMS11,
KMS12-PE, and KMS12-BM from Dr. Takemi Otsuki (Kawasaki
Medical School, Okayama, Japan); CAG, OPM-6, and MM.1R
from Dr. Joshua Epstein (University of Arkansas, Little Rock,
AK), Dr. Kenji Oritani (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan), and

suggested protocols for Guava Express and Guava Nexin,
respectively (Millipore).
For binding assays, live cells were incubated for 1 hour at
4°C with MAbs or MAb-IFNα diluted in 1% BSA-PBS. Cells
were pelleted and washed twice with 1% BSA-PBS before incubation for 1 hour at 4°C with 2 μg/mL of PE-conjugated
mouse antihuman IgG-Fc (Southern Biotech). After three
washes, binding was measured by flow cytometry.
For apoptosis assays, cells (5 × 105/mL) were incubated
with the indicated MAb or MAb-IFNα in 24-well plates for
48 hours before quantification of the percentage of Annexin
V–positive cells.

DNL constructs
Monospecific MAb-IFNα (20-2b-2b, 734-2b-2b and C2-2b2b) and the bispecific HexAb (20-C2-C2) was generated by
combination of an IgG-AD2 module with DDD2 modules
using the DNL method (Fig. 1C), as described previously
(10, 13). The 734-2b-2b, which comprises tetrameric IFNα2b
and MAb h734 (anti–indium DTPA IgG1), was used as a
nontargeting control MAb-IFNα.
The bispecific MAb-IFNα (20-C2-2b) was prepared as
follows. Briefly, three DNL modules (CH3-AD2-IgG-v-mab,
CH1-DDD2-Fab-hL243, and IFNα2b-DDD2) were combined
in equimolar quantities and incubated overnight with
1 mmol/L of reduced glutathione before the addition of
oxidized glutathione (2 mmol/L). 20-C2-2b was purified
sequentially on MAbSelect (GE Healthcare), His-Select
(Sigma-Aldrich), and immobilized WT affinity columns.

In vitro cytotoxicity
Cells were seeded in 48-well plates (300 μL/well) at predetermined optimal initial densities (1–2.5 × 105 cells/mL) in
the presence of increasing concentrations of the indicated
agents and incubated at 37°C until the density of untreated
cells increased ≥10-fold (4–7 d). Relative viable cell densities
at the end of the assay were determined using a CellTiter 96
Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega).

Analytic methods
Size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography
(SE-HPLC) was performed using an Alliance HPLC System
with a BioSuite 250, 4 μm of UHR SEC column (Waters
Corp.). Immunoreactivity was assessed by mixing excess
WT, anti-IFNα, or WR2 with 20-C2-2b prior to analysis of
the resulting immune complex by SE-HPLC.
SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing and nonreducing conditions using 12% and 4% to 20% gradient Tris-glycine
gels (Invitrogen), respectively.
Electrospray ionization time of flight liquid chromatography/
mass spectrometry was performed with a 1200 series HPLC
coupled with a 6210 time of flight mass spectrometry (Agilent
Technologies). 20-C2-2b was reduced with 10 mmol/L of tris(2carboxyethyl)phosphine at 60°C for 30 minutes and resolved by
reversed phase HPLC, using a 10-minute gradient of 20% to
90% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous formic acid with a Poroshell
300 SB, 5 μm C8 column (Agilent). For time of flight mass
spectrometry, the capillary and fragmentor voltages were set
to 5,500 and 200 V, respectively.
IFNα2b-specific activities were determined using the iLite
Human Interferon Alpha Cell–Based Assay Kit (PBL Interferon
Source), as described previously (10). Peginterferon alfa-2b
(Schering Corp.) was used as a positive control.
Cell binding and apoptosis
Cell binding and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry using a Guava PCA and the reagents, software, and

Ex vivo depletion of Daudi from whole blood
Blood specimens were collected under a protocol approved by the New England Institutional Review Board
(Wellesley, MA). Daudi (5 × 104) cells were mixed with heparinized whole blood (150 μL) from healthy volunteers and
incubated with MAbs or MAb-IFNα at 1 nmol/L for 2 days
at 37°C and 5% CO 2. Cells were stained with FITC antiCD19, FITC anti-CD14, APC anti-CD3, or APC mouse IgG1
isotype control MAb (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by flow
cytometry using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Daudi cells
are CD19+ and in the monocyte gate. Normal B and T cells
are CD19+ and CD3+ cells, respectively, in the lymphocyte
gate. Monocytes are CD14+ cells in the monocyte gate.

Results
Generation and characterization of 20-C2-2b
The bispecific MAb-IFNα was generated by combining the
IgG-AD2 module, CH3-AD2-IgG-v-mab, with two different
dimeric DDD modules, CH1-DDD2-Fab-hL243 and IFNα2bDDD2 (Fig. 1A). Due to the random association of either
DDD module with the two AD2 groups, two side-products,
20-C2-C2 and 20-2b-2b are expected to form, in addition to
20-C2-2b (Fig. 1C).
A detailed description of the generation, purification, and
biochemical characterization of 20-C2-2b is provided in the
Supplementary Results. The desired product (20-C2-2b) was
purified from the mixture using MAbSelect, His-Select, and
immobilized WT, which sequentially removed unreacted
DDD2 modules, 20-C2-C2, and 20-2b-2b, respectively. The purity of 20-C2-2b was shown by SDS-PAGE, which resolved a
cluster of high relative mobility (Mr) bands of the appropriate
molecular size and the five polypeptides comprising 20-C2-2b
under nonreducing and reducing conditions, respectively.
(Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). The mass of each of the
polypeptides comprising 20-C2-2b determined by liquid

chromatography/mass spectrometry was consistent with the
mass calculated from their deduced amino acid sequence
and predicted posttranslational modifications, including
N-linked glycosylation and amino-terminal pyroglutamate
on the HC-AD2 polypeptide as well as O-linked glycosylation
on a portion of the IFNα2b-DDD2 (ref. 14; Supplementary
Fig. S1C, Supplementary Table S1).
SE-HPLC analysis of 20-C2-2b resolved a predominant
protein peak with a retention time (6.7 min) consistent with
its calculated mass and between those of the larger 20-C2-C2
(6.6 min) and smaller 20-2b-2b (6.85 min), as well as some
higher molecular weight peaks that likely represent noncovalent dimers formed via self-association of IFNα2b (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
Immunoreactivity assays showed the homogeneity of 20C2-2b with each molecule containing the three functional
groups (Supplementary Fig. S1E). Incubation of 20-C2-2b
with an excess of antibodies to any of the three constituent
modules resulted in quantitative formation of high molecular
weight immune complexes and the disappearance of the
20-C2-2b peak. The His-Select and WT affinity unbound
fractions were not immunoreactive with WT and anti-IFNα,
respectively (data not shown).
Cell binding
The MAb-IFNα showed similar binding avidity to the parental MAbs (Fig. 2A). At subsaturating concentrations, similar binding levels were observed for 20-C2-2b and hL243γ4p.
The antigen density of HLA-DR is ∼6-fold greater than CD20
in these cells, allowing more binding of 20-C2-2b compared
with 20-2b-2b (15). Binding curves, which were analyzed using
a one-site binding nonlinear regression model, showed that
20-C2-2b could achieve a 4.7-fold higher Bmax compared with
20-2b-2b, with no significant difference observed between their
binding affinities (Kd ∼4 nmol/L; Fig. 2B).
IFNα biological activity
The specific activities for various MAb-IFNα were measured using a cell-based reporter gene assay and compared
with peginterferon alfa-2b (Fig. 2C). Expectedly, the specific
activity of 20-C2-2b (2,454 IU/pmol), which has two IFNα2b
groups, was significantly lower than that of 20-2b-2b (4,447
IU/pmol) or 734-2b-2b (3,764 IU/pmol), yet greater than peginterferon alfa-2b (P < 0.001). The difference between 20-2b2b and 734-2b-2b was not significant. The specific activity
among all agents varies minimally when normalized to IU/
pmol of total IFNα. Based on these data, the specific activity
of each IFNα2b group of the MAb-IFNα is approximately
30% of recombinant IFNα2b (∼4,000 IU/pmol).
In vitro cytotoxicity: NHL
The results of in vitro cytotoxicity assays with B-cell NHL
are summarized in Table 1, with individual dose–response
curves shown in Supplementary Fig. S4. The relative antigen
densities of HLA-DR and CD20 for each cell line have been
reported (15). The targeting index (TI) represents the fold increase in potency of a targeted MAb-IFNα compared with
nontargeted MAb-IFNα (734-2b-2b), with the EC50 values

converted to total IFNα concentration (I-EC50). Daudi is very
sensitive to cell killing by IFNα2, as shown with the nontargeting MAb-IFNα, 734-2b-2b (I-EC50 = 14 pmol/L). Targeting
CD20 on Daudi with the monospecific 20-2b-2b (I-EC50 =
0.4 pmol/L) further enhanced the potency 25-fold (TI = 25),
consistent with previous results (10). The potency enhancement
for the bispecific 20-C2-2b (I-EC50 = 0.08 pmol/L; TI = 125)
was 5-fold greater than 20-2b-2b, which can be attributed

the same number of anti-CD20 and anti–HLA-DR Fabs and
twice the amount (and activity) of IFNα2b.
The mantle cell lymphoma, Jeko-1, was considerably more
responsive to hL243γ4p (EC50 = 0.4 nmol/L) and less sensitive to IFNα2b (minimal effect with 734-2b-2b). Any treatment comprising hL243 was superior to 20-2b-2b (EC50 =
1 nmol/L). 20-C2-2b exhibited 2-fold enhanced potency compared with hL243γ4p or v-mab + hL243 + 734-2b. At
0.5 nmol/L, hL243γ4p and 734-2b-2b induced similar levels
of apoptosis and their effects are apparently additive because
treatment with v-mab + hL243 + 734-2b resulted in approximately twice the number of Annexin V–positive cells
compared with either agent alone (Fig. 3A). Presumably,
v-mab has little contribution in the mixture because alone
it had only a modest effect. Both 20-C2-2b and the mixture
were superior to 20-2b-2b (P < 0.002), due to the action
of hL243.

to the added antigen density of HLA-DR and possibly its
high-avidity tetravalent tumor binding. It is less likely that
hL243-induced signaling contributes additional cytotoxicity
at these low concentrations. The mixture of v-mab, hL243γ4p,
and 734-2b-2b (v-mab + hL243 + 734-2b) was equal to 734-2b-2b
alone, supporting the conclusion that hL243-induced signaling
does not contribute to the high TI of 20-C2-2b. Apoptosis was
induced in Daudi with only 1 pmol/L of any MAb-IFNα but not
with 10 pmol/L of v-mab or hL243γ4p (Fig. 3A). Treatment
with 20-2b-2b or 20-C2-2b resulted in significantly more apoptotic cells than 734-2b-2b or v-mab + hL243 + 734-2b (P < 0.0005).
There was no significant difference observed between
734-2b-2b and the mixture.
The 734-2b-2b had less effect on Raji (I-EC50 = 32 nmol/L)
and Ramos (I-EC50 > 80 nmol/L), resulting in maximal inhibition (Imax) of only 62% and 35%, respectively. Under these
conditions, hL243γ4p, but not v-mab (data not shown), inhibited these Burkitt lymphoma lines. The observed enhancement in potency of 20-C2-2b (TI = 118) was >50-fold greater
than 20-2b-2b (TI = 2) for Raji, which has much greater HLADR antigen density than CD20. Unlike Daudi and Raji, the
densities of HLA-DR and CD-20 are similar on Ramos, yet
the TI for 20-C2-2b was 15-fold greater than 20-2b-2b, indicating additive activities of hL243 and IFNα2b. The v-mab +
hL234 + 734-2b mixture was more potent than any of the single agents alone for Raji and Ramos. Targeting the IFNα2b
was critical for achieving maximal potency. In each of
the three Burkitt lymphoma lines, 20-C2-2b was more
effective than v-mab + hL234 + 734-2b, which comprises

In vitro cytotoxicity: myeloma
Whereas the eight MM cell lines vary in HLA-DR levels (and
only KMS12-BM expresses CD20) and sensitivity to IFNα2b
(Fig. 4), all responded to 20-C2-2b. Dose–response curves for
each of the eight MM cell lines tested are shown in Fig. 5, and
the results are summarized in Table 1. For example, five were
highly responsive to IFNα2 (I-EC50 <1 nmol/L for 734-2b-2b),
but varied in HLA-DR antigen density. Of these, only CAG,
which has high HLA-DR density, was inhibited by hL243γ4p
(>1 nmol/L), and showed an increased (additive) response to
a mixture of hL243γ4p and 734-2b-2b (hL243 + 734-2b) at higher

at 0.01 nmol/L, and the level observed for 0.1 nmol/L 20-C2-2b
was equal or higher than that resulting from any other treatment at 10-fold higher (1 nmol/L) concentration.
Enhanced potency of 20-C2-2b was evident, but lower, for
OPM6 (TI = 2), U266 (TI = 7), and MM.1R (TI = 10), which
were each highly IFNα-responsive but had lower HLA-DR
density and were not inhibited by hL243γ4p. No increased
potency was observed for 20-C2-2b on NCI-H929, which
was highly IFNα-responsive but is HLA-DR−.
KMS12-BM has high HLA-DR and CD20 antigen densities, and surprisingly, was inhibited by 20-2b-2b (I-EC50 =
31 nmol/L) but not 734-2b-2b (I-EC50 >100 nmol/L) or v-mab.
KMS12-BM was more responsive to v-mab + hL243 + 734-2b
(EC50 = 3 nmol/L) compared with hL243 + 734-2b (EC50 = 0.7
nmol/L), which in turn was superior to hL243γ4p alone
(EC50 = 3.5 nmol/L). Each of these treatments resulted in a
strong induction of apoptosis, with the relative levels consistent

with the in vitro cytotoxicity results (Fig. 3C). Additionally,
v-mab + hL243 induced more apoptosis than hL243γ4p
alone, but less than v-mab + hL243 + 734-2b. These results
suggest that for the HLA-DR+/CD20+ MM cells, the activity
of all three components of 20-C2-2b (EC 50 = 0.1 nmol/L)
could contribute to cytotoxicity when combined, even
though two of them have virtually no effect when used alone.
Evaluation of two additional DNL constructs in KMS12-BM
helped elucidate the enhanced potency of 20-C2-2b. A MAbIFNα designated C2-2b-2b, which comprises hL243 IgG1 and
tetrameric IFNα2b (twice that of 20-C2-2b), exhibited less
potent cytotoxicity (EC50 = 0.4 nmol/L) and weaker apoptosis induction compared with 20-C2-2b, supporting a contribution of v-mab. More revealing was the finding that 20-C2-C2,
a bispecific MAb comprising v-mab and four HLA-DR Fabs,
showed high-level induction of apoptosis and >50-fold
enhanced potency (EC 50 = 0.06 nmol/L) compared with
hL243γ4p, indicating that crosslinking of HLA-DR and CD20,
which occurs with 20-C2-2b, effectively induces cytotoxicity,
perhaps via a unique signaling cascade. Although each construct was potent (EC50<0.5 nmol/L), 20-C2-C2 (Imax = 67%)

7606

and C2-2b-2b (Imax = 70%) did not kill KMS12-BM as effectively
as 20-C2-2b (Imax = 99%), supporting the requirement of all
three components for achieving the maximal effect. That
the v-mab + hL243 + 734-2b (Imax = 87%) mixture was the only
other treatment resulting in >70% killing substantiates this
hypothesis.
Together, these data show that antigen density and sensitivity to the actions of IFNα2b, as well as those of the
targeting MAbs, are all important determinants of the
in vitro responsiveness of a particular cell line to the various MAb-IFNα. However, in vivo tumor killing may be
augmented by ADCC and the actions of immune effector
cells, which can be stimulated by the high local concentration of IFNα2b.
Effector functions and stability in human serum
We previously reported that 20-2b-2b exhibited enhanced
ADCC compared with its parent v-mab (10). By design,
hL243γ4p has diminished ADCC (11); however, 20-C2-C2 induced significantly (P = 0.0091) greater ADCC compared with
v-mab (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Notably, 20-C2-2b induced

significantly greater ADCC than either 20-2b-2b (P = 0.0040)
or 20-C2-C2 (P = 0.0115), indicating an enhancement of the
effector function by the presence of IFNα2b. As shown
previously for 20-2b-2b (10), 20-C2-2b does not induce CDC
in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
Two different assays for stability of 20-C2-2b in human
serum gave very similar results, indicating a loss of ∼3.5%
per day with roughly 65% remaining after 11 days at 37°C
(Supplementary Fig. S5C).
Ex vivo depletion of NHL from whole human blood
As shown in Fig. 6, Daudi cells were depleted from whole
blood (ex vivo) more effectively by 20-C2-2b (91%) compared
with 20-2b-2b (69%), v-mab (49%), hL243γ4p (46%), or 7342b-2b (10%). Both targeted MAb-IFNα were less toxic to
normal B cells compared with Daudi. Under these conditions, B cells were significantly depleted by 20-C2-2b (57%)
and hL243γ4p (41%), but not by v-mab, 734-2b, or 20-2b2b. Monocytes were depleted by hL243γ4p (48%), 734-2b-2b
(30%), and 20-2b-2b (21%), but not by v-mab. 20-C2-2b (98%)
was highly toxic to monocytes. None of the agents had a
significant effect on T cells. Statistical significance with
P < 0.001 was determined by Student's t test for each of
the differences in percentage of depletion indicated above.

Discussion
We and others have reported that fusion proteins comprising CD20-targeting MAbs and IFNα are more effective against
NHL compared with combinations of MAb and IFNα in xenograft and syngeneic mouse models, indicating that MAb-IFNα

could overcome the toxicity and pharmacokinetic limitations
associated with IFNα (10, 16). Although CD20 is an attractive
candidate for targeted MAb-IFNα therapy of B-cell lymphoma,
its expression is largely limited to malignancies of this lineage,
with some individuals exhibiting low antigen density. Here, we
report the first bispecific immunocytokine, 20-C2-2b, which
specifically targets IFNα2b to both CD20 and HLA-DR, thus
potentially expanding the hematopoietic tumor types amenable to this immunocytokine therapy.
Anti–HLA-DR MAbs efficiently induce apoptosis, which
is mediated by direct signaling without the requirement
of additional crosslinking, and are also potent inducers
of ADCC and CDC (11, 15, 17). Where ADCC may enhance
therapeutic potential, CDC is largely responsible for the
pathogenesis of side effects associated with the MAb infusion (18). The humanized anti–HLA-DR MAb, hL243γ4p,
used as a control in this study was engineered for improved clinical safety by using the constant region of the
human IgG4 isotype, resulting in diminished ADCC and
CDC (11, 15). 20-C2-2b is unique among anti–HLA-DR
MAbs in that it lacks CDC, similar to hL243γ4p, but has
potent (enhanced) ADCC, making this agent an attractive
candidate for immunotherapy.
In the ex vivo setting, v-mab can deplete cells via signalinginduced apoptosis, ADCC, and CDC; MAb-IFNα can employ
enhanced ADCC as well as both MAb- and IFNα2b-induced
signaling, but not CDC; and hL243-γ4p is limited to only
direct signaling (11). Although the full spectrum of IFNαmediated activation of innate and adaptive immunity that
might occur in vivo is not realized in this setting, it provides
pharmacodynamic data. 20-C2-2b depleted lymphoma cells

more effectively than normal B cells and had no effect on
T cells; however, it did efficiently eliminate monocytes, indicating that careful monitoring of toxicology will be important
for this potent agent. Where v-mab had no effect on monocytes, depletion was observed following treatment with
hL243α4p and MAb-IFNα, with 20-2b-2b and 734-2b-2b exhibiting similar toxicity. Therefore, the predictably higher potency of 20-C2-2b is attributed to the combined actions of
anti–HLA-DR and IFNα, which may be augmented by HLADR targeting. These data suggest that monocyte depletion
might be a pharmacodynamic effect associated with anti–
HLA-DR as well as IFNα therapy; however, this side affect
would likely be transient because the monocyte population
should be repopulated from hematopoietic stem cells.
The four NHL and eight MM cell lines we studied encompass the naturally occurring heterogeneity in expression and
antigen density of HLA-DR and CD20, as well as responsiveness to the actions of IFNα, hL243, and v-mab, which all
effect MAb-IFNα immunotherapy. Six and eight (of 12) cell
lines were inhibited (I max >30%) to varying degrees by
hL243γ4p and 734-2b-2b, respectively. 20-C2-2b potently inhibited (EC50 <1 nmol/L) 11 of the 12 cell lines, with an EC50
≤0.01 nmol/L for five. Even the least affected MM line
(KMS11), which was not inhibited by 734-2b-2b, was responsive to 20-C2-2b (EC50 = 17 nmol/L). An enhancement in
the potency of 20-C2-2b over 734-2b-2b was observed in all
of the lines besides NCI-H929, which is HLA-DR−/CD20−.
Higher levels of HLA-DR antigen density as well as responsiveness to hL243 correlated with a greater TI for 20-C2-2b,
demonstrating additive activities of IFNα and hL243, as well
as the significance of targeting, even in vitro. 20-C2-2b was
superior to the mixture of v-mab + hL243 + 734-2b in 10 of
the lines, further highlighting the effect of tumor targeting,
which will be considerably greater in vivo, as shown previously for 20-2b-2b (10). Furthermore, in vivo–targeted MAb-IFNα
might elicit a potent antitumor immune response.
Whereas the vast majority of cells comprising primary MM
specimens are nonclonogenic and have a plasma cell phenotype (CD138+/CD19−/CD20−), putative MM cancer stem cells
are CD138− and express B-cell surface antigens, including
CD45, CD19, CD20, and CD22, reminiscent of memory B cells
(19). Although a variety of clinical approaches have produced
responses, MM remains largely incurable due to relapses
thought to be mediated by cancer stem cells, which are resistant to various therapies (20–23). The B-cell phenotype of the
putative stem cells prompted clinical investigation with rituximab in MM; however, limited effects on outcome were
realized (24). The in vitro results with KMS12-BM are compelling, because it is CD20+, similar to the proposed MM

stem cells. 20-C2-2b exhibited potent cytotoxicity and robustly induced the apoptosis of KMS12-BM. Even though nontargeted MAb-IFNα and v-mab were ineffective as single
agents, they both apparently contribute to cytotoxicity when
used in combination with hL243. The results also indicate
that bispecific binding of CD20 and HLA-DR may induce
an additional (potent) signal that further enhances toxicity
to these cells and may sensitize them to IFNα.
MAb-IFNα produced by DNL exhibits comparable activity
to recombinant IFNα. Recently, Xuan and colleagues reported
that anti–CD20-IFNα fusion proteins made by traditional recombinant engineering showed a 300-fold reduction in IFNα
activity (16). This is noteworthy in comparisons of similar
Daudi xenograft studies, where a single 17-ng dose of 20-2b2b significantly improved survival (10), compared with three
30-μg doses (>5,000-fold more) used for recombinant anti–
CD20-hIFNα (16). Studies using IFNα-secreting tumors
showed enhanced immune responses elicited by a localized
concentration of IFNα (25). Where this might also be achieved
with highly active MAb-IFNα, the reduced activity of traditional recombinant MAb-IFNα might not efficiently recruit and
stimulate an antitumor immune response, as was reported
by Xuan and colleagues (16).
The bispecific MAb-IFNα 20-C2-2b is attractive for the
treatment of NHL because each of the three components is
active against this disease. This study suggests that 20-C2-2b
may also be useful for the therapy of MM and possibly other
hematopoietic malignancies. The prospective uses of 20-C22b and other constructs introduced herein (C2-2b-2b and
20-C2-C2) in additional diseases, including various leukemias, are the subject of future studies.
