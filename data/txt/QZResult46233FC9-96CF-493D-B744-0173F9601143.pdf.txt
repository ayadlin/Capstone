ABSTRACT
Melatonin, a molecule produced throughout the animal and plant kingdoms,
and berberine, a plant derived agent, both exhibit antitumor and multiple biological
and pharmacological effects, but they have never been combined altogether for the
inhibition of human lung cancers. In this study, we investigated the role and underlying
mechanisms of melatonin in the regulation of antitumor activity of berberine in lung
cancer cells. Treatment with melatonin effectively increased the berberine-mediated
inhibitions of cell proliferation, colony formation and cell migration, thereby enhancing
the sensitivities of lung cancer cells to berberine. Melatonin also markedly increased
apoptosis induced by berberine. Further mechanism study showed that melatonin
promoted the cleavage of caspse-9 and PARP, enhanced the inhibition of Bcl2, and
triggered the releasing of cytochrome C (Cyto C), thereby increasing the berberineinduced apoptosis. Melatonin also enhanced the berberine-mediated inhibition of
telomerase reverses transcriptase (hTERT) by down-regulating the expression
of AP-2β and its binding on hTERT promoter. Moreover, melatonin enhanced the
berberine-mediated inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) by inhibiting the nuclear
translocation of NF-κB and its binding on COX-2 promoter. Melatonin also increased
the berberine-mediated inhibition of the phosphorylated Akt and ERK. Collectively,
our results demonstrated that melatonin enhanced the antitumor activity of berberine
by activating caspase/Cyto C and inhibiting AP-2β/hTERT, NF-κB/COX-2 and Akt/
ERK signaling pathways. Our findings provide new insights in exploring the potential
therapeutic strategies and novel targets for lung cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND

cells through simultaneous modulation of caspase/
cytochrome C, AP-2β/hTERT, NF-κB/COX-2, and Akt/
ERK signaling pathways. Our findings provide new
insights in exploring the potential therapeutic strategies
and novel targets for lung cancer treatment.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancerrelated death. The incidence of non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), a major form of lung cancer, has been
increasing in the past several decades [1]. Recent advances
in lung cancer biology and genetics have suggested many
new treatment strategies such as chemotherapy and
radiation therapy, however, the outcome is still poor. The
management of locally advanced NSCLC has progressed
in recent years with the use of combined therapeutic
modalities. Thus, optimization of combinations of
conventional and novel therapeutic agents may improve
the outcome of treatment for lung cancer.
Melatonin (MT) is a phylogenetically wellpreserved molecule produced in the pineal gland or
derived from plants [2–5]. In addition to its well-known
regulatory control of the sleep/wake cycle, as well as
circadian rhythms generally, melatonin has a wide range
of reported biologic effects, including antioxidant [6–9],
free radical scavenging, anti-inflammatory [10–12],
and anti-aging activities [13, 14]. There is abundant
evidence indicating that melatonin also has important
antitumor properties by preventing tumor initiation,
promotion, and progression [15–27]. Previous studies
have also demonstrated the involvement of the melatonin
receptor in mediation of melatonin effects on growthsuppression and gene-modulation in cancer cells [28, 29].
Although evidence of the beneficial effects of melatonin
is expanding, the exact molecular mechanisms by which
melatonin exerts tumor inhibition effect is unclear, and
uncertainty of the combinational treatment of melatonin
with other antitumor agents still remains.
Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline derivative
alkaloid isolated from the rhizome, roots and stem bark
of a number of Chinese herbs, the Berberis species. It
has long history of use for treating diarrhea in traditional
Chinese medicine. A growing number of studies reveal
that berberine possesses multiple pharmacological
activities, including antitumor [30–40], anti-diarrheal [41],
anti-hypertensive [42], anti-microbial [43, 44] and antiinflammatory activities [45–48]. However, so far there has
been no investigation concerning the combined treatment
of berberine with the natural anticancer agent melatonin
for tumor inhibition in human lung cancer.
In this study, we postulated that a combination
of melatonin and berberine could achieve the enhanced
effects in the inhibition of lung cancer cell growth
by targeting multiple cell signaling pathways. To test
this possibility, we investigated the combined effects
of melatonin and berberine on cell viability, colony
formation, cell morphology, cell migration and apoptosis
in human NSCLC cells lines H1299 and A549, and further
elucidated the underlying mechanisms of actions. Our
results showed for the first time that melatonin enhanced
the berberine-mediated growth inhibition of lung cancer

RESULTS
Melatonin enhanced the berberine-mediated
inhibitions of cell proliferation and colony
formation
We first evaluated the combined effects of melatonin
at the pharmacologic concentration (1.0 mM) with
berberine at various doses (20 μM to 200 μM) on cell
growth inhibitions in H1299 and A549 cells. As shown
in Figure 1A, treatment with berberine alone inhibited
cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. However,
pretreatment of the cells with melatonin markedly
enhanced the growth inhibitions of H1299 and A549
cells compared with the treatment with berberine alone
(Figure 1A), resulting in a marked reduction of the IC50
values of berberine in inhibiting cell growth (Figure 1B).
To confirm the enhanced antitumor activity by melatonin,
we also tested the effects of these two agents on tumor cell
clonogenicity in H1299 cells. Pretreatment with melatonin
(1.0 mM) considerably increased the inhibition of colony
formation induced by berberine (100 μM) (Figure 1C),
leading to a significant decrease at colony formation ratio
by comparison with the treatment with berberine alone
(Figure 1D).

Melatonin enhanced the berberine-mediated cell
morphological change and migration inhibition
We next analyzed the effect of melatonin on the
berberine-mediated changes in cell morphology and
spreading in H1299 cells. As shown in Figure 2A, the
cells treated with melatonin (1.0 mM) or berberine (100
μM) alone formed a cell layer, and more spread and
filopodia were observed. By contrast, pretreatment with
melatonin markedly enhanced the berberine-induced
deduction of cell-to-cell contact and lower spreading with
fewer formation of filopodia compared with the treatment
with berberine alone, indicating that melatonin promoted
the berberine-mediated changes in cell morphology and
spreading in NSCLC cells.
We also examined the effect of melatonin on the
berberine-mediated inhibition of cell migration in H1299
cells by a wound-healing assay. Consistent with the data
from cell growth inhibition and morphology change,
pretreatment with melatonin (1.0 mM) considerably
increased the erberine-mediated inhibition of cell
migration (Figure 2B). The part of gap or wounding space
between cell layers after making a scratch was occupied
partially by the migrating cells after 48 h in the groups

treated with melatonin or berberine alone. However, the
empty space of the cells was not occupied by the migrating
cells cotreated with melatonin and berberine (Figure 2B).
In order to identify the underlying mechanisms involved in
cell migration, we also tested the protein levels of MMP9
and β-catein, and found that the protein levels of MMP9
and β-catein were markedly decreased after melatonin and
berberine treatment (Figure 2C).

We also analyzed the effect of melatonin on the
berberine-induced apoptosis in H1299 cells. Treatment
with berberine alone at the doses of 20 μM or 100 μM
induced 7.1% and 44.7% apoptotic cells (Figure  3A).

Figure 1: Melatonin enhanced the berberine-mediated inhibitions of cell growth and colony formation. A, B. Human
H1299 and A549 cells were treated with melatonin (MT, 1 mM) and berberine (BBR) at the indicated doses. At 48 hours after treatment,
the cell viability (A) was determined by a MTT assay, and the IC50 values of BBR for cell viability inhibition (B) in cells treated with or
without melatonin were determined. C, D. The H1299 cell-induced colony formation was analyzed (C), and the colony formation rate (D)
was calculated. Cells treated with DMSO were used as the referent group with cell viability set at 100%. The percent cell viability in each
treatment group was calculated relative to cells treated with DMSO vehicle control. The data are presented as mean ± SD of three tests.

However, pretreatment with melatonin (1.0 mM)
significantly increased the populations of apoptotic cells
(Figure 3B), resulting in a 9.1% to 73.4% induction of
apoptotic cells.
The activation of caspase cascade forms the essential
basis of apoptosis. The release of cytochrome C from the
mitochondrial inter-membrane space into the cytosol is
the precondition of caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway.
Next, we detected the expression of the pro-apoptotic
proteins, caspase-9, caspase-3, PARP and BAX, as well as
the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, in H1299 cells by Western
blot analysis. Pretreatment with melatonin  (1.0  mM)
effectively enhanced the berberine-mediated up-regulation
of the cleaved caspase-3, caspase-9 and PARP as well as
BAX and down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein as compared
with those treated with berberine alone (Figure 3C),
confirming the enhanced effect of melatonin on apoptosis
induction.
We also performed immunofluorescence imaging
(IFI) analysis to monitor the changes in the subcellular
localization of cytochrome C in H1299 cells to examine
whether the melatonin could enhance the berberineinduced cytochrome C releasing. Treatment with berberine
(100 μM) alone also induced the release of cytochrome
C from the inter-mitochondrial space into the cytosol.
However, pretreatment with melatonin (1 mM) effectively
promoted the releasing of cytochrome C compared to the
treatment with berberine alone (Figure 3D). These results
demonstrate that melatonin may facilitate the downstream
cytochrome C dependent apoptosome assembly and
caspase activation in the cytosol in lung cancer cells.

(Figure 4A), thereby inhibiting the binding of AP-2β
to the hTERT promoter (Figure 4C). In addition, we
also detected the effects of berberine and melatonin
on hTERT promoter activity. The results showed that
pretreatment with melatonin effectively enhanced the
berberine-mediated inhibition on hTERT promoter activity
(Figure 4E).
To further confirm that the AP-2β signaling is
involved in the melatonin-mediated enhancement of
inhibition of cell growth, H1299 cells were transfected
with an AP-2β specific siRNA (100 nM) or an AP-2βexpressing vector and then cotreated with melatonin
(1.0 mM) and berberine (100 μM). As shown in Figure 4D,
by comparison with the non-specific siRNA control
(si-NC), knockdown of AP-2β expression by AP-2β siRNA
(si-AP-2β) slightly increased the cell growth inhibition
mediated by melatonin and berberine. Conversely,
overexpression of AP-2β by transfection the expressing
vector (AP-2β) effectively reversed the inhibition of
cell growth as compared with the transfection with the
control vector LacZ (Figure 4D). These results show
that the enhancement of growth inhibition by melatonin
is mediated at least in part through inhibition of AP-2β/
hTERT signaling pathway in NSCLC cells.

Melatonin enhanced the berberine-mediated
inhibition of the NF-κB/COX-2 signaling
The COX-2 signaling is closely implicated in
lung cancer cell growth, migration and angiogenesis
[50, 51]. To determine the effect of melatonin on COX2 signaling in NSCLC cancer cells, we analyzed the
expression of COX-2 protein in the H1299 and A549 cells
treated with melatonin or berberine alone or altogether
by Western blotting. Treatment with berberine alone did
not significantly inhibited COX-2 protein expression.
However, pretreatment of melatonin (1.0 mM) in NSCLC
cells markedly increased the inhibition of COX-2 protein
expression in the berberine-treated H1299 and A549 cells
(Figure 5A and 5B).
To confirm that melatonin enhanced the inhibition of
COX-2 signaling, H1299 cells were treated with a COX2-selective inhibitor celecoxib (20 μM), and followed
the treatment of melatonin (1.0 mM) and berberine
(100 μM). As shown in Figure 5D, pretreatment with
celecoxib (CB) alone also inhibited cell viability, whereas
a combined treatment with melatonin and berberine did
not significantly alter cell viability inhibition mediated
by the COX-2-selective inhibitor, indicating that COX2 signaling is also an important target for melatonin in
NSCLC cells.
The expression of COX-2 is tightly regulated by
the binding activity of p50 NF-κB on COX-2 promoter
structure. We next determined whether melatonin also
inhibited the binding of p50 NF-κB on COX-2 promoter
in H1299 cells. Streptavidin-agarose pulldown assay

Melatonin enhanced the berberine-mediated
suppression of the AP-2β/hTERT signaling
hTERT is a hallmark of lung tumorigenesis. It is
highly expressed in lung cancer cells and tightly regulated
by transcriptional factor AP-2β [49].To determine whether
melatonin also affect the AP-2/hTERT signaling in NSCLC
cells, we treated NSCLC cells with melatonin (1.0 mM)
or berberine (20 μM or 100 μM) alone or altogether, and
examined expression of AP-2β and hTERT at protein and
mRNA levels by Western blot and RT-PCR, respectively.
Treatment with berberine alone downregulated the
expression of hTERT and AP-2β at protein (Figure 4A)
and mRNA levels (Figure  4B). However, pretreatment
with melatonin (1 mM) considerably enhanced the
berberine-mediated inhibitions on AP-2β and hTERT
proteins (Figure 4A) and mRNAs (Figure 4B) levels by
comparison with those treated with either berberine alone.
Since hTERT expression is tightly controlled by
the binding activity of AP-2β on hTERT promoter, we
next performed streptavidin-agarose pulldown assay to
examine the effect of melatonin on AP-2β binding activity
in H1299 cells. Treatment with berberine and melatonin
considerably suppressed the expression of AP-2β protein

the binding activity of p50 NF-κB on COX-2 promoter,
however, pretreatment with melatonin markedly inhibited
p50 NF-κB binding to COX-2 promoter compared with

those treated with berberine alone (Figure 5C). The
expression of p50 protein was not changed by melatonin
and berberine alone or altogether (Figure 5A). Moreover,
we also detected the effect of the combined treatment

on COX-2 promoter activity. The results showed that
pretreatment with melatonin effectively enhanced the
berberine-mediated inhibition of COX-2 promoter activity
(Figure 5F).
The translocation of NF-κB in cell nuclei and
cytoplasm plays a key role in regulating COX-2 gene
expression. We next performed immunofluorescence assay
to evaluate the effect of melatonin on p50 and p65 NF-κB
translocation in H1299 cells by a confocal microscope.
Constitutive translocation of NF-κB p50 and p65 to the
cell nuclei was detected (Figure 5E). Treatment with
berberine (100 μM) alone also caused slight translocation
of the p50 and p65 from cell nuclei to cytoplasm.
However, pretreatment with melatonin effectively
enhanced the berberine-mediated nuclear translocation of
p50 and p65 NF-κB. The results indicate that the enhanced
inhibition of tumor cell growth by melatonin might be
also mediated partially via the p50/p65 NF-κB/COX-2
signaling pathway in NSCLC cells.
As melatonin and berberine regulated the
translocation of NF-kb in cell nuclei and cytoplasm,
next we detected the effect of melatonin and berberine

on the up-stream regulator of NF-kB, phosphorylation of
IKK. As shown in Figure 5A, treatment with melatonin
and berberine alone or combination both could decrease
the level of p-IKK, and pretreatment with melatonin
effectively enhanced the berberine-mediated decrease
on p-IKK.

Melatonin enhanced the berberine-mediated
inhibition of the Akt/ERK signaling
The PI3K/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK signaling play
important roles in tumor cell growth and is implicated
in the expression of the cancer-related genes such as
hTERT and COX-2. To determine whether the melatoninmediated enhancement of cell growth inhibition is also
through the inhibitions of the PI3K/Akt and Raf/MEK/
ERK signaling pathway, we next analyzed the effect
of melatonin on Akt and ERK phosphorylation in the
berberine-treated H1299 cells by Western blot. As shown
in Figure 6A, treatment with berberine (20 μM and
100 μM) inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2
proteins, whereas pretreatment with melatonin (1.0 mM)

Figure 6: Melatonin enhanced the berberine-mediated inactivation of Akt /ERK signaling. A. H1299 cells were treated with

melatonin (MT, 1.0 mM) and berberine (BBR, 20 or 100 μM). At 48 hours after treatment, the expression of the total and phosphorylated

30 μM) (B) or the Mek1/2-selective inhibitor U0126 (50 μM) (C) for 24 hours, respectively, and then treated with melatonin (MT, 1.0 mM)
and berberine (BBR, 100 μM). At 48 hours after treatment, cell viability was determined by MTT analysis. The percent cell viability in each
treatment group was calculated relative to cells treated with the vehicle control. The data are presented as the mean ± SD of three separate
experiments. *P < 0.05, significant differences between treatment groups and control groups.

effectively increased the berberine-mediated inhibition
of the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 proteins. The
total protein levels of Akt and ERK1/2 did not change by
melatonin and berberine alone or altogether.
To further confirm that melatonin targets Akt/
ERK signaling to inhibit NSCLC cell growth, we next
analyzed the effect of an Akt or ERK-selective inhibitor
on the melatonin and berberine-mediated inhibition of
cell viability in H1299 cells. Treatment with LY29400,
the Akt inhibitor or U0126, the inhibitor of Mek1/2 (the
direct upstream molecule of ERK1/2) effectively inhibited
cell viability. However, pretreatment with these inhibitors
did not significantly change the cell growth inhibitions
mediated by melatonin (Figure 6B), indicating that the

Ak/ERK signaling is an important target for melatonin
in enhancing the berberine-mediated growth inhibition in
NSCLC cells.

Melatonin enhanced the berberine-mediated
inhibition of lung cancer growth in a xenograft
mouse model in vivo
To confirm the enhanced berberine-mediated
inhibition of lung cancer growth by melatonin, we
analyzed the effects of melatonin and berberine treatment
on tumorigenicity in vivo using a A549 xenograft mouse
model. After administration with MT and BBR alone or
together for 17 days, both the tumor weights (Figure 7A)

and tumor volumes (Figure 7B, 7C) were inhibited by
treating with MT and BBR alone, however, treatment
with MT and BBR together markedly enhanced the
growth inhibitions of xenograft compared with the
treatment with BBR alone. The combined treatment did
not affect significantly the body weight weights of the
mice (Figure 7D). These results supported that MT could
enhance BBR-mediated inhibition of the xenografted
human lung cancer cell’s growth without the remarkable
adverse effects.

efficiency for lung cancer. However, the combination
of melantonin and berberine made an additive but
not a synergistic anti-tumor effect. Therefore, further
investigations about the clinical significance of this
combination therapy are needed.
The activation of caspase cascade forms the
essential basis of apoptosis. The release of cytochrome
C from the mitochondrial inter-membrane space into
the cytosol is the precondition of caspase-dependent
apoptosis pathway. In this study, we have also shown that
melatonin markedly enhanced activation of caspases and
promoted releasing of cytochrome C from mitochondria
to cytosol.
hTERT is an important component of human
telomerase, which lengthens chromosome ends and
maintains chromosomal stability, leading to cellular
immortalization [53]. It is commonly overexpressed in
a wide range of human cancers, including lung cancer
[54]. Inhibition of hTERT expression was found to
contribute to prevent proliferation and angiogenesis and
to induce apoptosis of human cells. hTERT expression is
transcriptionally controlled by the binding of activating
enhancer-binding protein-2β (AP-2β) to the corresponding
sites located in their promoters [49]. By binding to the
hTERT promoter, AP-2β exerts its biological effects
through activation of the tumor-related gene hTERT. AP2β factors orchestrate a variety of cell processes including
apoptosis, cell growth, and tissue differentiation during
embryogenesis. Gene knockout experiments with AP-2β
have shown that AP2-β-deficient mice die shortly after
birth owing to collecting duct and distal tubular epithelial
defects caused by massive renal epithelial cell apoptosis.
However, no information is available about the regulation
of AP-2β/hTERT signaling by melatonin and berberine
in human lung cancer cells. In our study, we showed
that melantonin down-regulated the expression of AP-2β
and hTERT, thereby inhibited cell proliferation. When
AP-2β was increased by overexpression with the use of
melantonin, the melatonin-mediated cell growth inhibition
was rescued. However, further study about the expression
of hTERT, the target gene of AP-2β, is needed in the
rescue experiment.
COX-2 overexpression commonly appears in a
wide range of human cancers, including lung cancer. Its
expression and the sequential PGE2 production could
upregulate EGFR, PI3K, and ERK1/2 signaling to induce
angiogenesis, cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis
of tumor cells. Melatonin has been shown to play antitumor and anti-inflammation roles partially through
inhibiting COX-2 expression [55]. Our current study
also demonstrated that melatonin enhanced berberinemediated inhibition of COX-2 expression in NSCLC
cells.
COX-2 expression is transcriptionally controlled by
the binding of multiple transactivators and coactivators
to the corresponding sites located in its promoter. Among

DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated the response of
human lung cancer cells to the combined treatment
of melatonin and berberine. Melatonin effectively
enhanced the berberine-mediated cell growth inhibition
and apoptosis induction in NSCLC cells. Our results
also showed that the enhancement of tumor cell growth
inhibition by melatonin is mediated through simultaneous
modulation of caspase/cytochrome C, AP-2β/hTERT, NFκB/COX-2, and Akt/ERK dependent signaling pathways.
To the best of our knowledge, it might be the first time
to report that melatonin sensitized human lung cancer
cells to berberine and to demonstrate the underlying
mechanisms of action.
Melatonin plays an important role not only in
the regulation of the circadian rhythm but also in
the modulation of cancer risk by acting as an antiinflammatory agent and an antioxidant. Melatonin has
been shown to potentiate flavone-induced apoptosis in
human cancer cells by increasing the level of glycolytic
end products [52]. It also helps decrease angiogenesis
in cancer cells, which means that it helped block blood
supply to the tumor, resulting in tumor suppression.
Melatonin is capable of modulating the signaling
pathways associated with anti-proliferation and proapoptotic effect in cancer cells to inhibit growth of
different tumors. Berberine has been shown to exhibit a
broad range of pharmacological properties such as antitumor, anti-angiogenesis, and anti-metastasis activities.
Both melatonin and berberine have respectively been
shown to inhibit cancer cell growth in a huge number
of studies, and they have been used in combination with
other chemotherapeutic agents in various cancer cells,
but they have never been combined altogether as an antilung cancer treatment. In this study, we hypothesized that
melatonin might play a role in sensitizing or synergizing
lung cancer cellular response to berberine treatment and
actually analyzed the combined effect of melatonin and
berberine on cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis
in lung cancer cells. We found that melatonin indeed
potentiated the effects of berberine alone on cell growth
inhibition and apoptosis induction. All the results might
serve as a basis for guiding the combinational treatment
of natural anticancer compounds in improving therapy

the known several regulatory elements distributing in the
core promoter region of COX-2 transcription start site,
NF-κB binding site is essential for COX-2 promoter
activity [56, 57]. Because melatonin enhanced the
inhibition of COX-2 expression, we were interested in
whether melatonin would modulate NF-κB signaling in
NSCLC cells. In our study, we confirmed the nuclear
localization of p50 NF-κB in NSCLC cells. We found
that the enhanced inhibition of COX-2 expression by
melatonin is partially mediated by stimulating p50 NFκB translocation from cell nuclear to cytosol. We also
further demonstrated the increased inhibitory effects of
melatonin in NSCLC cells were mediated by inhibiting
the binding of p50 NF-κB to COX-2 promoter. Further

studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which
melatonin enhances the inhibitions of p50 acetylation and
phosphorylation.
In summary, melatonin sensitized NSCLC cells to
berberine and enhanced the growth inhibitory effect of
berberine by simultaneously targeting caspase/cytochrome
C, AP-2β/hTERT, NF-kB/COX-2, Akt/ERK signaling
pathways (Figure 8). These findings provide new insights
into understanding the molecular mechanisms by which
melatonin sensitizes NSCLC cells to berberine treatment,
and suggest some clues for the development of new
therapeutic strategies in human lung cancer therapy.
Further studies are warranted to more firmly establish this
supposition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

formation inhibitory ratio = (number of colonies treated
with melatonin or berberine/number of cells inoculated)
x 100%.

Cell culture
The human lung cell lines H1299 and A549 were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured as monolayers in
RPMI 1640 culture media supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin and 100
μg/ml streptomycin, and maintained in an incubator with a
humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C.
The H1299 cells were treated with 100 nm PMA for 8 hours.

Wound-healing assay
Wound-healing assay was performed to detect cell
migration. The cells were grown to full confluency in sixwell plates and incubated overnight in starvation medium.
Cell monolayers were wounded with a sterile 100 μL
pipette tip, washed with starvation medium to remove
detached cells from the plates. Cells were treated with
indicated doses of melatonin or berberine in full medium
and kept in a CO2 incubator. After 48 h, medium was
replaced with PBS, the wound gap was observed and cells
were photographed using an Olympus microscope fitted
with digital camera.

Reagents and antibodies
Melatonin, berberine and celecoxib were purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and dissolved in a small
amount of DMSO before addition to the complete cell
culture medium. Streptavidin-agarose was purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Antibodies to GAPDH,
AP-2β, hTERT, COX-2, p50, cytochrome-c, PARP,
caspase-9, BAX and Bcl-2 were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against Akt,
ERK1/2, phosphrylated Akt or ERK1/2 were purchased
from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA).

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry using
Annexin-V staining-based fluorescence-activated cell
sorter (FACS). In brief, cells plated in 6-well plates were
treated with melatonin or berberine alone or altogether. At
48 h after treatment, cells were collected and washed once
with cold PBS, and subsequently stained with Annexin V
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Stained cells were analyzed
by flow cytometry.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined using MTT assay
(Roche Diagnosis, Indianapolis, IN). Briefly, lung cancer
cell lines were seeded at 4 × 103 cells/well in 96-well plates.
Cells were cultured for overnight, and then the cells were
changed to fresh medium containing various concentrations
of melatonin and berberine dissolved in DMSO (final
concentration, 0.1%). After the cells were incubated for
48 h, the growth of cells was measured. The effect on cell
viability was assessed as the percent cell viability compared
with vehicle-treated control cells, which were arbitrarily
assigned 100% viability. The berberine concentration
required to cause 50% cell growth inhibition (EC50) was
determined by interpolation from dose-response curves.

Western blot analysis
Cell lysate proteins were separated by electrophoresis
in a 10% sodium dodecyl suplfate-polyacrylamide minigel
(SDS-PAGE) and electrophoretically transferred to a
PVDF membrane. Western blots were probed with the
specific antibodies. The protein bands were detected by
enhanced chemiluminescence.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Total cellular RNA was extracted with Tri-Zol
reagent (Life Technologies, Glasgow, UK) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was reversetranscribed by using the Superscript™-III kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). PCR analysis was performed on aliquots
of the cDNA preparations to detect gene expression. The
amplified products were visualized on 1% agarose gels.
PCR conditions were 4 min at 94°C followed by 30 cycles
(25 for GAPDH): 30 seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at 60°C,
and 1 min at 72°C,

Anchorage independent colony formation
Cells plated in 6-well plates were treated with
melatonin or berberine alone or altogether. After 24 h,
cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized. Then cells
(8 × 103/ml) were mixed in 1 ml of 0.3% McCoy’s 5a
agar containing 10% FBS. The cultures were maintained
in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 21 days. The medium
was discarded and the cells were carefully washed with
PBS twice. After being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 15 min, the cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet
for 15 min before washing with tap water and air-drying.
The colonies with more than 50 cells were counted with
an ordinary optical microscope. The colony formation rate
was calculated with the following formula: Plate colony

Transfection
The transfection of siRNAs or expressing vectors
were performed by Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

DNA-protein binding by streptavidin-agarose
pulldown assay

divided into four treatment groups that each contained
five mice, group A treated with PBS; group B with 25mg/
kg MT; group C with 10mg/kg BBR; group D with MT
and BBR by intraperitoneal injection every day. Tumors
were measured with a caliper every 2 days, and the
tumor volume was calculated using the formula V = 1/2
(width2 × length). Body weights were also recorded. On
day 30 after tumor cell inoculation, all experimental mice
were terminated with ether anesthesia and the total weight
of the tumors in each mouse was measured.

Binding of AP-2β or p50 NF-κB to hTERT or
COX-2 core promoter probes were determined by a
streptavidin-agarose pulldown assay. A biotin-labeled
double-stranded probe corresponding to hTERT or COX2 promoter sequence was synthesized. The binding assay
was performed by mixing 400 μg of nuclear extract
proteins, 4 μg of the biotinylated DNA probe and 40 μl
of 4% streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads at room
temperature for 1 h in a rotating shaker. Beads were
pelleted by centrifugation to pull down the DNA-protein
complex. After washing, proteins in the complex were
analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies (1 μg/
ml each) specific for AP-2β or p50 NF-κB. The mixture
was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with shaking,
and centrifuged to pull down the DNA-protein complex.
DNA-bound AP-2β or p50 NF-κB protein was dissociated
and analyzed by Western blotting. A non-immune rabbit
IgG (1 μg/ml) was also used as negative controls.

Statistical analysis
Analysis of variance and Student’s t test were used
to compare the values of the test and control samples.
P <  0.05 was considered to a statistically significant
difference. SPSS6.0 software was used for all statistical
analysis. The significance was analyzed by the paired t
test. All the experiments were done three times, and mean
values and standard deviation were calculated.

Confocal immunofluorescence

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

For confocal microscopy analysis, cells grown on
chamber slides were washed in PBS and fixed for 15 min
at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde. The
samples were pretreated with 10% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) in PBS for 30 min. Antibodies against p50 in the
blocking solution were added to the sample and incubated
for overnight at 4°C. Nonimmune IgG was included
as controls. Following five 5-min washes with PBS,
fluorescein isothiocyanate- and rhodamineconjugated
secondary antibodies were added in blocking solutions
and incubated for 1 hour. After five additional 5-min
washes, samples were examined with a Zeiss LSM700
confocal microscope, and images were processed with
Zen2010 software. More than 100 cells were inspected
per experiment, and cells with typical morphology were
presented.
