ABSTRACT
Background: Olaparib is an oral inhibitor of polyadenosine 5’-diphosphoribose
polymerization (PARP) that has previously shown signs of activity in patients with
BRCA mutations and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
Patients and Methods: In this phase 1 dose-escalation trial in patients with
unresectable PDAC, we determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of olaparib
(tablet formulation) in combination with irinotecan 70 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 and
cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 28-day cycle (olaparib plus IC). We then
studied the safety and tolerability of adding mitomycin C 5 mg/m2 on day 1 to this
regimen (olaparib plus ICM).
Results: 18 patients with unresectable PDAC were enrolled. The MTD of olaparib
plus IC was olaparib 100 mg twice-daily on days 1 and 8. The addition of mitomycin C
to this dose level was not tolerated. Grade ≥3 drug-related adverse events (AEs) were
encountered in 16 patients (89%). The most common grade ≥3 drug-related toxicities
included neutropenia (89%), lymphopenia (72%), and anemia (22%). Two patients
(11%), both of whom had remained on study for more than 12 cycles, developed
drug-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The objective response rate (ORR)
for all evaluable patients was 23%. One patient who carried a deleterious germline
BRCA2 mutation had a durable clinical response lasting more than four years, but
died from complications of treatment-related MDS.
Conclusions: Olaparib had substantial toxicity when combined with IC or ICM in
patients with PDAC, and this treatment combination did not have an acceptable risk/
benefit profile for further study. However, durable clinical responses were observed in a
subset of patients and further clinical investigation of PARP inhibitors in PDAC is warranted.
Trial registration: This clinical trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as
NCT01296763.

survival for patients with metastatic disease is less than one
year [5, 6]. This highlights the continued need for novel and
effective therapies for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
Olaparib (AZD2281, LynparzaTM) is an oral inhibitor
of polyadenosine 5’-diphosphoribose [poly-(ADP-ribose)]
polymerization (PARP), an enzyme essential in the repair
of DNA [7–9]. In tumors with defects in homologous DNA
repair, PARP inhibition results in the accumulation of singlestrand breaks, which are converted during replication to
irreparable DNA double-strand breaks and cellular death
by apoptosis. Cells with defects in double-strand break
repair such as those from BRCA defects are hypersensitive
to PARP inhibition, a process called synthetic lethality [10,
11]. Multiple PARP inhibitors have been approved or are in
clinical development for ovarian and other cancers. Although
PARP inhibitors have clinical activity in cancers without
known defects in homologous DNA repair, preclinical and
clinical trials have shown higher clinical response rates in
patients with tumors harboring such defects [12, 13].
Molecular alterations in homologous DNA repair are
known to occur in a subset of pancreatic cancers. Inherited
genetic factors account for approximately 5-10% of
pancreatic cancer, and BRCA2 is the most common known
germline mutation identified [14]. In addition to BRCA2,
other germline mutations that have been implicated
in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma include BRCA1,
PALB2, other Fanconi anemia pathway members, and
other homologous DNA repair pathways [15, 16]. In one
recent cohort study of over 300 patients with pancreatic
cancer, pathologic germline mutations in BRCA2 were
identified in 3.3%, BRCA1 mutations in 1.2%, and PALB2
in 0% [17]. Somatic mutations affecting genes involved
in homologous DNA repair are also identified in a small
percentage of pancreatic cancers [18]. In a basket study of
single-agent olaparib in patients with a germline BRCA1/2
mutation, encouraging signs of activity were observed in
the subset of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer,
with 5 of 23 (21.7%) obtaining an objective response to
therapy and multiple patients with stable disease [19].
These results suggested that PARP inhibitors may be
effective in the subset of patients with pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma harboring defects in DNA repair.
PARP inhibitors may also augment the anti-tumor effects
of DNA-damaging agents in cancers. Regimens combining
PARP inhibitors with cytotoxic agents have synergistic activity
in multiple preclinical models [10, 20, 21], but have been
limited by unacceptable hematologic toxicity at higher doses
[22, 23]. Irinotecan, cisplatin, and mitomycin C (ICM) is an
active chemotherapy regimen in pancreatic cancer that has
moderate toxicity [24]. In preclinical work (RLF), ICM was
highly effective at inducing DNA damage (PARP activity, and
apoptosis) in pancreatic cancer cell lines. In an unpublished
pilot study of ICM (without olaparib) from our group (RLF), 7
of 10 patients with a known pathologic BRCA mutation, and 6
of 20 patients with sporadic pancreatic cancer had an objective

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

response to therapy. The treatment combination was also well
tolerated with no grade 3 or 4 toxicities.
In this phase 1 dose-escalation trial, we evaluated the
safety and tolerability of olaparib in combination with lowdoses of irinotecan and cisplatin (olaparib plus IC), escalating
to IC with olaparib plus mitomycin C (olaparib plus ICM),
in patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer. We
hypothesized that the addition of a PARP inhibitor to low
doses of cytotoxic agents would be safe and would potentiate
the tumor response to the cytotoxic agents, especially in
patients with DNA repair pathway deficiencies.

RESULTS
Patients
In total, 18 patients with pancreatic cancer were
enrolled and received treatment at Johns Hopkins Kimmel
Cancer Center (N=16) and at Columbia University Medical
Center (N=2). The clinicopathological characteristics of
the patients entered in this study are shown in Table 1.
The majority of patients were heavily pretreated, with
13 of 18 (72%) having received 2 or more prior systemic
therapies for pancreatic cancer. Two patients (11%) had
undergone prior BRCA testing and had a known BRCA2
mutation. None of the other patients enrolled had known
or suspected defects in homologous DNA repair.

Sequence of dose levels studied and DLTs
The original dose-escalation strategy is outlined in
Table 2.
Dose level 1 (olaparib 100 mg twice-daily on days 1
and 8 plus IC) enrolled six patients. One of the six patients
experienced a DLT of grade 4 neutropenia lasting 7 days.
Per protocol, the investigators recommended increasing
the treatment dose level to level 2.
Dose level 2 (olaparib 100mg twice daily on days
1-3 and 8-10 plus IC) enrolled six patients. One of the
patients experienced colonic obstruction at the end of the
first cycle of therapy and ultimately died as a result of
this complication, but this adverse event was attributed to
disease progression rather than drug toxicity and was not
considered a DLT. Three of the six patients on dose level
2 experienced a DLT of grade 4 neutropenia lasting greater
than 7 days, and the investigators recommended reducing
treatment dose to the previous dose level. Therefore, dose
levels 3 and 4 were not pursued and olaparib 100 mg twice
daily on days 1 and 8 plus IC was selected as the MTD to
which mitomycin C was added in dose level 5.
Dose level 5 (olaparib 100 mg twice daily on days
1 and 8 plus ICM) enrolled six patients. Two of these
patients experienced a DLT of grade 4 neutropenia lasting
greater than 7 days, and one patient experienced a DLT
of grade 3 neutropenic fever. Based on these three DLTs,

because of drug toxicity, and ten patients (56%) required
dose delays or reductions because of toxicity. Treatmentrelated adverse events are shown Table 3. Overall, grade ≥3
drug-related adverse events (AEs) were encountered in 16
patients (89%). The most common grade ≥3 drug-related
toxicities pertained to hematologic toxicity and included
neutropenia (89%), lymphopenia (72%), and anemia (22%).
There were 10 drug-related serious adverse events
(SAEs) reported. These SAEs included febrile neutropenia
(n=3), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n=2), atrial
fibrillation, severe anemia, hematemesis, and a subdural
hematoma that occurred in the setting of drug-related
thrombocytopenia. Of the three patients who received 12 or
more cycles of therapy, two developed MDS. Both patients
who developed MDS were in dose level 1 (IC plus olaparib
100 mg twice daily on days 1 and 8) and had experienced
an objective clinical response to therapy. Both patients had
experienced cytopenias related to therapy that was managed
with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) injections.
The first patient who developed MDS had a known BRCA2
mutation and had obtained no prior systemic therapy for
pancreatic cancer. After receiving approximately 2 years of
treatment on study with olaparib reduced down to 25 mg bid on
day one of each cycle only (in combination with IC), the patient
developed worsening cytopenias. A bone marrow aspirate
demonstrated dysplastic cell maturation, and chromosomal
analysis showed monosomy 7 consistent with therapy-related
MDS. The patient received azacitidine treatment for MDS but
died from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) almost five years
after study initiation. The second patient had received two
prior regimens before enrolling on this study, and was on study
treatment for approximately one year before discontinuation
for disease progression. Approximately six months after
discontinuation from study treatment, the patient developed
worsening cytopenias and a bone marrow biopsy demonstrated
multilineage abnormalities and a borderline increase in blasts
consistent with therapy-related MDS.

Clinical activity
Five patients came off study because of toxicity
(n=4) or clinical progression (n=1) prior to the first
restaging scan. Therefore, 13 patients (72%) were
evaluable for clinical activity. The best tumor response
for each patient is shown in Figure 1. Three patients
experienced a partial response (PR) as a best response to
therapy and there were no complete responses (CRs). The
ORR for evaluable patients was 23%. Two of the patients
who experienced a PR were treated in dose level 1, and
one was treated in dose level 5. Five patients (46%) had
stable disease (SD) as a best response to therapy. The
disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) was 62%. Among
the two patients with known BRCA2 mutations, one
experienced a durable PR lasting over four years until
death from AML, and the other had stable disease lasting
approximately three months as a best response to therapy.

lymphopenia, anemia. Although MDS is a known potential
complication of olaparib, the rate of MDS in the present
study was higher than we had anticipated, and was
higher than previous studies of olaparib monotherapy. In
a prior single-arm trial of olaparib monotherapy, MDS/
AML was confirmed in 6/298 (2%) of patients [19, 28].
The olaparib dose used in this study was lower than the
standard approved monotherapy dose of 300 mg bid
daily. In a randomized study of olaparib (300mg BD vs
placebo) the incidence of MDS was 1.47% in the olaparib
arm and 0.78% in the placebo arm) [29]. In the present
study, MDS/AML was observed in 11.1% of patients,
albeit in a small sample size. This number may be an
underrepresentation of the risk of MDS/AML from the
current treatment regimen because many of the patients
were on therapy for only a relatively brief time due to
intolerance to therapy, and others died of progressive
disease before MDS/AML would have developed. The
risk of treatment-related MDS/AML is likely related to
the duration of drug exposure [19], and therefore it is
notable that two out of three patients who remained on
study for more than 12 cycles developed MDS/AML in
the current study. MDS and AML are clonal processes that
arise when hematopoietic progenitor cells acquire specific
driver mutations [29]. Although there is no evidence that
olaparib alone acts as a mutagenic agent, the combination
of chemotherapy-induced DNA damage coupled with an
impairment of compensatory DNA repair as a result of
PARP inhibition with olaparib may explain the possible
MDS signal observed in this study.
PARP inhibitors have previously been successfully
combined with chemotherapy in other clinical settings.
For example, a recent randomized trial of olaparib plus
paclitaxel reportedly only modestly increased rates
of neutropenia than paclitaxel monotherapy (30% vs
23%), and no cases of MDS [30]. Olaparib was also
successfully combined with gemcitabine in pancreatic
cancer without any unmanageable or unexpected toxicities
[22]. However, other attempts to combine olaparib with
cisplatin-containing regimens have resulted in significant
hematologic toxicity [23]. This may be related to the
potentiation of cisplatin activity with even intermittent
PARP inhibition. Thus, infrequent low-dose olaparib can
produce clinically meaningful toxicity when combined
with specific chemotherapy regimens. Although PARP
inhibitors and DNA damaging agents are a rational
drug combination with encouraging signs of activity in
preclinical models [10, 20, 21], future clinical trials of
combination therapies that include PARP inhibitor should
be vigilant about monitoring for hematologic toxicity.
Encouraging evidence of clinical activity was
observed in this trial, including a BRCA2 mutation positive
patient who had a remarkable and durable response.
However, treatment with ICM alone (without olaparib) also
demonstrated clinical benefit in a previous unpublished
trial from our group (RLF), and was generally well
tolerated. Therefore, the substantial toxicity and modest
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

efficacy observed in present study from the addition of
a PARP inhibitor to this prior regimen did not support
advancement of this treatment combination into phase
2. Multiple additional studies testing olaparib and other
PARP inhibitors to treat pancreatic cancer are ongoing.
Use of olaparib monotherapy in the maintenance setting
(NCT02184195), or in combination therapy with regimens
less likely to cause hematologic toxicity such as irinotecan
alone (NCT00576654), may be more successful strategies
to incorporate PARP inhibitors into the management of
pancreatic cancer. Additionally, the use of PARP inhibitors
in pancreatic cancer harboring DNA repair pathway
deficiencies may result in higher response rates than were
observed in this study, which included patients not selected
for such mutations. Limitations of this study include the
absence of somatic or germline sequencing data on the
majority of participants, and the absence of absence of
correlative or pharmacokinetic data for the study agents.
Additionally, it is not possible to distinguish the toxicity
and efficacy contributions of each component of the studied
olaparib plus ICM treatment regimen.
In summary, the combination of olaparib with
the DNA damaging regimen IC and ICM was not well
tolerated and caused frequent hematologic adverse
events. PARP inhibitors continue to be promising
therapeutic agents for pancreatic cancer, particularly in
the subset of patients with tumors harboring DNA repair
pathway deficiencies, and alternative clinical approaches
to incorporating these agents into the management of
pancreatic cancer should be investigated.

METHODS
Eligibility
Patients were eligible for the study if they were 18
years or older with histologic or cytologic confirmation of
unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status of ≤2; life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks; and adequate
hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Measurable
disease according to RECIST 1.1 criteria was also
required. The presence of a BRCA mutation or other cancer
DNA repair pathway deficiency was not an eligibility
requirement. However, an attempt was made to enrich the
study population with patients harboring tumors with DNA
repair pathway deficiency who might in theory be most
likely to achieve a favorable clinical response to PARP
inhibitor-based therapy. This was achieved by providing
priority enrollment to patients with known BRCA1/2
mutations, Jewish individuals (~6% of whom are estimated
to carry a germline BRCA1/2 mutation [25]), and patients
with familial pancreatic cancer (who are thought to be
enriched for defects in homologous DNA repair).
Any number of prior chemotherapy regimens were
allowed; however, prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor
44078

Oncotarget

or more than one drug component of the ICM regimen
was not permitted. Additionally, in an attempt to restrict
enrollment to patients with adequate hematologic reserve,
patients were required to have received ≤12 months of
chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Prior surgery,
chemotherapy or other investigational therapies were not
permitted within three weeks of the initiation of study
treatment. Prior radiation therapy was not permitted within
four weeks of the start of study treatment.

the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial was registered under
ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01296763.

Response assessments
The primary objective of the study was to determine
the MTD. The National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version
4.0 was implemented for adverse event monitoring [26]. A
DLT was defined in the protocol as treatment delay of >2
weeks for reasons of toxicity; or thrombocytopenia with
platelets <25k for ≥7 days; or grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥7
days; or grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia; or grade ≥3 nonhematological toxicities excluding grade 3 diarrhea, nausea/
vomiting, fatigue, lethargy and gamma-glutamyltransferase
(GGT) elevation during the first cycle of therapy.
Disease assessments (computed tomography or
magnetic resonance imaging) were performed every other
cycle of therapy. The objective response rate (ORR) was
evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1 [27]. Upon
progression of disease, patients were monitored for longterm adverse events and survival.

Study design
We used a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design
to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in this
phase 1 dose-escalation trial. The MTD was defined
as the highest dose level for which at most 1 out of 6
patients experienced a dose limited toxicity (DLT) during
the first cycle of treatment. If 0 of 3 patients had a DLT,
the escalation was continued to the next dose level.
If 1 of 3 patients had a DLT then 3 more patients were
enrolled at that dose. If 1 of 6 patients had a DLT then the
escalation was continued. If 2 or more patients treated at
a particular dose level had a DLT the dose was reduced to
the previous dose level. Subjects continued to receive the
specified doses for their cohort until disease progression
or toxicity. In the event of drug toxicity, dose reductions
of each drug used were based on the clinician’s best
judgment.
The predetermined dose levels are listed in Table 2.
In dose levels 1 to 4, a dose of 70mg/m2 of irinotecan
and 25mg/m2 of cisplatin on days 1 and 8 were studied
in combination with escalating doses and frequency of
olaparib (100 mg twice daily on days 1 and 8 in dose level
1, up to 200 mg twice daily on days 1-12 in dose level 4)
of a 28-day cycle. If patients did not tolerate the starting
dose (dose level 1), the frequency of olaparib therapy
could be further reduced to once every month (dose level
-1). If patients were cisplatin-intolerant or had neuropathy,
the protocol allowed for the substitution of carboplatin for
cisplatin at a dose of AUC = 3. Once an optimal dose level
of olaparib plus IC was obtained (dose levels -1 to 4), then
mitomycin C was added to the regimen at a dose of 5 mg/
m2 on day 1 of each cycle (dose level 5). Granulocytecolony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was not administered
prophylactically unless patients developed persistent
neutropenia or febrile neutropenia. In such cases, G-CSF
was generally continued prophylactically to limit future
episodes of febrile neutropenia.
Participants were enrolled at two academic
medical centers, Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center
and Columbia University Medical Center. All patients
provided written informed consent for this study. Olaparib
was supplied by the Investigational Products Supply (IPS)
section of AstraZeneca. The protocol was approved by
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at both study sites,
and complied with the International Ethical Guidelines
for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical analysis
The study protocol allowed a maximum of 30
patients to be enrolled in this phase 1 trial to determine the
MTD of olaparib in combination with ICM. Descriptive
statistics were used to describe the safety and tolerability
of the treatment regimen, as no formal statistical
comparisons of the data were performed. Patients who
developed DLTs requiring discontinuation of the treatment
regimen were censored for the efficacy outcomes at the
time of discontinuation. Reasonable attempts were made
to establish updated responses for patients who withdrew
for toxicity prior to scheduled assessments.
