Abstract

Author Manuscript

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely reported to display strong
efficacy for cancer chemoprevention, although their mechanism of action is poorly understood.
The most well documented effects of NSAIDs include inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and
induction of apoptosis, but their effect on tumor cell invasion has not been well studied. Here we
show that the NSAID, sulindac sulfide (SS) can potently inhibit the invasion of human MDAMB-231 breast and HCT116 colon tumor cells in vitro at concentrations less than those required to
inhibit tumor cell growth. To study the molecular basis for this activity, we investigated the
involvement of microRNA (miRNA). A total of 132 miRNAs were found to be altered in response
to SS treatment including miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9, which have been previously
implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. We confirmed that these miRNA can stimulate tumor
cell invasion and show that SS can attenuate their invasive effects by down-regulating their
expression. Employing luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, NF-κB was found to
bind the promoters of all four miRNAs to suppress their expression at the transcriptional level. We
show that SS can inhibit the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus by decreasing the
phosphorylation of IKKβ and IκB. Analysis of the promoter sequences of the miRNAs suppressed
by SS revealed that 81 of 115 sequences contained NF-κB binding sites. These results show that
SS can inhibit tumor cell invasion by suppressing NF-κB mediated transcription of miRNAs.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a chemically diverse family of drugs
commonly used to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions and pain associated with
arthritis. The long-term use of NSAIDs has been reported to significantly reduce the
incidence and risk of death from colorectal and other types of cancer 1. In addition, the
NSAID sulindac displays strong efficacy in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis to
suppress adenoma size and number by as much as 60–70% 2. These observations are
consistent with preclinical studies that have shown pronounced inhibitory effects of sulindac
and other NSAIDs on tumorigenesis in experimental rodent models 3–6. The
pharmacological basis for the anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs involves the inhibition
of two distinct cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and -2) that share similar catalytic activity but have
different patterns of expression and sensitivity to inhibitors. The antineoplastic activity of
NSAIDs is primarily believed to involve both anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects by
the inhibition of COX-2, which is elevated in tumor cells 7. However, other studies support
the involvement of a COX-independent mechanism 8–14.

Although indomethacin (a sulindac analog) has been shown to significantly increase survival
of patients with metastastic disease 15, there have been only a few studies describing the
effects of NSAIDs on tumor invasion and metastasis. For example, a recent report
demonstrated that sulindac can inhibit metastasis by disrupting β-catenin signaling 16.
Tumor invasion and metastasis involves multiple steps that induce neoplastic cells to spread
and migrate to surrounding tissue, beyond the borders of the original tumor, and which are
hallmarks of malignant tumors that lead to failure of chemotherapy 17. Numerous studies
have focused on the identification and characterization of the markers associated with tumor
cell invasion and metastasis, but the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate these
complex biological processes are largely unknown.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are naturally occurring, single-stranded, non-coding sequences of
small RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional and translational
levels 18, 19. In contrast with messenger RNAs, miRNAs are a small set of approximately
1,500 RNA molecules. Each miRNA can control the expression of several hundred cognate
messenger RNA targets simultaneously, and more than 30% of human genes are known to
be regulated by miRNAs 20. MiRNAs have been implicated in many biological events such
as cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, as well as tumor cell invasion
and metastasis 21–24.

In this study, we found that the NSAID, sulindac sulfide (SS) can potently inhibit the
invasion of human breast and colon tumor cells at concentrations less than those required to
inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro. SS treatment altered the expression of 132 miRNAs, in
which several are known to be associated with tumor invasion and metastasis, including
miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9 25–31. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that more than
70% of the down-regulated miRNAs contain NF-κB binding sites in their promoter regions,
which suggest that NF-κB can mediate the effects of SS on miRNA expression. This study
functionally demonstrates that SS can inhibit tumor cell invasion by a novel mechanism

involving the suppression of NF-κB signaling to inhibit the transcription of miRNAs
involved in tumor cell invasion and metastasis.

Results
SS inhibits tumor cell invasion without affecting tumor cell growth

Author Manuscript

To determine the effects of SS on tumor cell invasion in vitro, the human breast MDAMB-231 and colorectal HCT116 tumor cell lines were plated on matrigel-coated inserts and
treated with different concentrations of SS for 36 h. Counting of viable cell number was
performed in parallel to simultaneously measure the tumor cell growth inhibitory activity of
SS. Figures 1A and 1B show that SS can inhibit the invasion of both tumor cell lines in a
dose-dependent manner, whereby a concentration of 50 µM was found to have a significant
inhibitory effect when compared to vehicle-treated control cells (>2-fold; p<0.05). In
contrast, viable cell number was not significantly affected at this concentration level
(p>0.05), although longer treatments of 48–72 h, resulted in reduced numbers of viable cells
as expected (Figure 1C and 1D). These results show that SS can inhibit tumor cell invasion
at concentrations lower than those required to inhibit tumor cell growth, which suggest that a
distinct molecular mechanisms may be responsible for these effects.
MiRNAs are altered in response to treatment with SS in HCT 116 cells

Author Manuscript

Employing Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA), we determined miRNA expression
profiles in HCT116 cells treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or SS (50 µM) for 36 h. The
results showed that SS treatment induced 17 miRNAs, while 115 miRNAs were suppressed
by 2-fold or greater (Supplementary Figure 1). To confirm this finding, we measured the
expression of miR-9, miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-125, which have been previously
reported to be involved in tumor cell invasion or metastasis 25–32 by employing the SYBR
green-based qRT-PCR assay and using the same sample sets tested by the array. The results
showed high consistency between the two data sets (Supplementary Figure 2).
MiRNAs mediate the SS-induced inhibition of tumor cell invasion

Author Manuscript

MiR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9 are four of the most well documented miRNAs that
are elevated during tumor cell invasion and metastasis 25–31. To determine if these miRNAs
could mediate the inhibition of tumor cell invasion by SS, we transfected synthetic miRNA
oligonucleotides into MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 cells, as well as two additional tumor cell
lines, SUM1315 (breast) and HT29 (colon). The results showed that the elevation of
miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9 not only stimulated the invasion of all four tumor cell
lines (Figure 2A), but that SS can attenuate their effect on tumor cell invasion (Figure 2B).
Interestingly, the miR-pool consisting of miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9 at an equal
percent (25%) displayed greater effects than each single miRNA on promoting tumor cell
invasion and rescuing the inhibition of SS.
NF-κB regulates the selected miRNAs at the transcriptional level
To study the mechanism by which SS regulates miRNA expression, we screened the
promoter regions (−2,000 to +500 bp) of 132 miRNAs from the array data using the
interface provided by SITECON (http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/sitecon/) and

found that 81 of the 115 miRNAs that were suppressed by SS contained NF-κB binding sites
(>70%; Supplementary Figure 1; the miRNA list is shown in Supplementary Table 2),
which implies that NF-κB may play an important role in regulation of miRNA expression by
SS. As known, the biogenesis of miRNAs is similar to gene transcription and the primary
miRNA (pri-miRNA) is the transcript of the miRNA gene. Given that NF-κB can regulate
miRNA expression at transcriptional level, pri-miRNA can be up-regulated after NF-κB is
induced.

Author Manuscript

TNFα is commonly used to induce NF-κB by activating the IKK complex 33–35. The
activation of IKK complex results in phosphorylation of IκB family members (IκBα, IκBβ
and IκBε) that accounts for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of IκB 36, 37. Before
moving to the nucleus and activating target genes regulated by κB sites, NF-κB is retained
in the cytoplasm by unphosphorylated IκB, while the phosphorylation of IκB can promote
the translocation of NF-κB. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) is another NF-κB inducer involving
direct degradation of IκB, which causes release of NF-κB from the cytoplasm 38. A p65 NFκB plasmid construct, which can result in the over-expression of NF-κB in MDA-MB-231
and HCT116 cells (Supplementary Figure 3) was employed as a positive control to
determine if the induction of pri-miRNAs by TNFα and DCA involve NF-κB signaling. As
shown in Figure 3, all four pri-miRNAs, miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9, could be
up-regulated by TNFα, DCA, and the p65 construct in both MDA-MB-231 and HCT116
cells, which implies the involvement of NF-κB in regulating miRNA expression through
transcriptional modulation.

Author Manuscript

To further study the mechanistic role of NF-κB in mediating expression of miRNAs
inhibited by SS, we measured the relative expression of miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and
miR-9 using qRT-PCR in response to treatment with the NF-κB inducer, TNFα and the
inhibitor, Bay11-7082 39. The results, as summarized in Table 1, show that the expression of
miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9 can either be significantly induced by TNFα or
reduced by Bay11-7082 in both MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 tumor cells. After adding
Bay11-7082 to cells that were pre-treated by TNFα, the inductive effect of TNFα was
attenuated. These results together indicate that NF-κB is capable of regulating the
expression of miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9 at the transcriptional level. When
treating MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 cells with SS, we found that SS not only can reduce
the expression of miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9 as did Bay11-7082, but also can
prevent the inductive effect of TNFα on the expression of these miRNAs. These results
demonstrate that NF-κB signaling can mediate the inhibition of miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21,
and miR-9 by SS to account for its inhibitory effect on tumor cell invasion.

Author Manuscript

We next determined if NF-κB can directly bind to the promoter of the selected miRNAs.
First, we used a luciferase assay that measures the interaction of NF-κB and the promoter of
miR-10b. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the DNA upstream of the miR-10b gene
contained two putative binding sites of p65 (W1: −1078 to −1065; W2: −379 to −365). Both
binding sites were amplified and cloned into luciferase reporter vectors. The corresponding
mutated constructs with deletion of the binding sequence (M1 and M2) were also amplified
(Figure 4A). All constructs were transfected into HCT116 cells. After using TNFα to induce
NF-κB, W2 significantly increased luciferase activity when compared to M2, but W1

displayed a similar response as M1 to TNFα (Figure 4B). Secondly, we co-transfected the
p65 construct and luciferase reporters with miR-10b promoter fragments into HCT116 cells
and obtained the same result as with TNFα stimulation (Figure 4C). To confirm the direct
binding of NF-κB to the miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9 genes, we performed a
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using HCT116 cells. The chromatin was
immunoprecipitated by p65 NF-κB antibody, and the immunoprecipitated DNA fragments
were amplified using the primers designated for the each miRNA’s promoter. MiR-17 and
miR-21 were documented to be regulated by NF-κB at the transcription level 40, and the
same primer sets were used again in this study. The PCR results showed that the DNA
fragments immunoprecipitated by the p65 NF-κB antibody contain the promoter sequences
of miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9 (Figure 4D), which demonstrates the direct
binding of NF-κB to these miRNA genes. Moreover, the ChIP results verified the luciferase
assay results that W2 (−379 to −365) is the true binding sites of NF-κB in the miR-10b
promoter.
SS prevents the translocation of NF-κB through inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKKβ

Author Manuscript

The activation of IKK complex can regulate the transcriptional activity of NF-κB through
IκB phosphorylation as discussed above. Previous studies reported that SS can induce
apoptotic cell death through inhibition of IKKβ, which implies that NF-κB regulation is an
important pathway for mediating the antineoplastic properties of sulindac 41, 42. However,
this effect has not been explored with regard to the inhibitory effect of SS on tumor cell
invasion. We therefore examined the expression levels of IKKβ and phosphorylated IKKβ
(p-IKKβ) in MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 cells following the treatment with SS. Figure 5A
showed that p-IKKβ is significantly decreased in response to SS treatment at a concentration
of 50 µM for 36 h. After induction by TNFα, the expression of phosphorylated IκBα (pIκBα) was elevated in both MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 cells. However, SS treatment
significantly decreased p-IκBα (Figure 5B), which might account for the attenuation of the
inductive effect of TNFα by SS. The accumulation of unphosphorylated IκBα by SS retains
NF-κB in the cytoplasm resulting in the suppression of NF-κB transcriptional activity.
Moreover, using an NF-κB immunofluorescence assay, we showed that SS can prevent NFκB nuclear localization. In both MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 cells, SS treatment was found
to dramatically reduce the expression of NF-κB in the nucleus even after TNFα induction
(Figure 5C). Altogether, these results show that SS is capable of suppressing the
phosphorylation of IKKβ and IκBα, which leads to the retention of NF-κB in the cytoplasm
to reduce the transcription of miRNA genes, such as miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9
that are involved in tumor cell invasion and metastasis.

Discussion
A large body of evidence indicates that sulindac has strong cancer chemopreventive
efficacy, although its use for patients with malignant disease have not been well studied.
Several publications have reported that sulindac can inhibit the invasion of tumor cells from
glioblastoma 21, hepatoma 43, and colorectal cancer 16, but the mechanism of action has not
been well defined. Here we demonstrate that SS can potently inhibit tumor cell invasion at
concentrations less than those required to inhibit tumor cell growth by a novel mechanism

that involves the inhibition of NF-κB signaling to suppress specific miRNAs and their target
genes.

Author Manuscript

MiRNAs have been recognized as important regulators of gene expression based on the
repression on their cognate genes, which affects many essential biological processes,
including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, tumor cell invasion and
metastasis 21–24. The majority of human miRNAs are transcribed from miRNA genes 44, 45
in which their biogenesis is spatially and temporally regulated in response to extracellular
stimuli 18, 19. Compared to a large number of studies on the regulatory functions of
miRNAs, only a few reports have described the transcriptional regulation of miRNAs.
Similar to the mechanism of messenger RNA transcription, miRNA expression is regulated
by a number of transcription factors. In addition to the report by our group first describing
the transcriptional regulation of miRNA expression by p53 46, other groups have reported
that different transcription factors such as c-Myc, NF-κB, STAT3 and C/EBPα are also
involved in the regulation of miRNAs 47–51. Because the nature of miRNA is non-coding
RNA molecules, the transcriptional process is of importance for regulating expression of
miRNA. Our findings suggest that NF-κB regulation of miRNA transcription mediates the
inhibitory effect of SS on tumor cell invasion.

Although sulindac has been previously reported to inhibit NF-κB activation42, there have
been no reports describing an association between miRNAs and the antineoplastic properties
of sulindac. In this study we report that SS treatment leads to the suppression of 115
miRNAs and up-regulation of 17 miRNAs. Interestingly, more than 70% of the downregulated miRNAs contain NF-κB binding sequences within their promoter regions (−2,000
to +500bp; Supplementary Figure 1). This is consistent with previous studies reporting that a
number of miRNAs, such as miR-132, miR-146, miR-155, miR-9, the miR-17-92 cluster,
miR-125b-1, miR-23b-27b-24-1, miR-21, miR-30b, and miR-130a, can be regulated by NFκB in human cancer cell lines 40, 47, 52, 53. Although miRNAs are regulated by certain
transcription factors such as p53, c-Myc, STAT3, and NF-κB, the mechanism of
transcriptional regulation of miRNAs is different from that of messenger RNA. First,
miRNAs that are in the same genomic loci are organized in a single gene and share the same
promoter to generate a polycistronic primary transcript, which ultimately produces multiple
mature miRNAs 54. For example, the miR-17-92 gene encodes six miRNAs: miR-17,
miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b-1 and miR-92-1 55. In this study, we found that SS
can suppress all members of the miR-17-92 cluster in HCT116 cells (Supplementary Table
2), and confirmed the NF-κB binding site in the promoter of the miR-17 gene. Second,
many miRNA genes are located in the introns of host genes and are referred to as intronic
miRNAs that share the promoters with the host genes for transcription 56. Third,
approximately 40% of human miRNA loci are located less than 3 kb from an adjacent
miRNA locus 7, 57, which implies that multiple miRNA genes can be transcribed together
using the same promoter. In this study, we found that miR-125b, let-7c and miR-99a are
suppressed in response to SS treatment (Supplementary Table 2). MiR-125b, but not let-7c
or miR-99a, has a putative binding site for NF- κB. These three miRNA genes have been
found to be clustered and co-transfected in a coordinated manner 58.

All NF-κB family members including RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1(p50), and NFκB2(p52) are able to recognize κB binding sites within their target gene’s promoter
regions 59. The activation domain (TAD) is the most important component that is
responsible for the transcriptional activity of NF-κB 60. In this study, we demonstrate that
SS can decrease phosphorylated IKKβ and IκB. The phosphorylation of IκB can release NFκB to enter the nucleus but the accumulation of unphosphorylated IκB by SS retains NF-κB
in the cytoplasm. Therefore, SS can inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Moreover,
we found that miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9, are directly regulated by p65 NF-κB
using the luciferase reporter assay and/or ChIP assay. Altogether, these data suggest SS can
inhibit tumor cell invasion by a molecular pathway that is mediated by NF-κB and miRNAs.

We demonstrated that miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9 are involved in tumor cell
invasion in response to SS treatment, which is consistent with previous studies showing the
involvement of these miRNA in breast tumor cell invasion and metastasis 25–31. MiR-10b is
well documented to be associated with metastasis via activation of the pro-metastatic gene
Ras homolog gene family member C by inhibiting the translation of gene Homeobox D10
(HOXD10) 28, 61. Recently, it is also reported that the silencing of miR-10b can directly
inhibit metastasis of breast cancer cells 27. MiR-17, a member of the miR-17-92 cluster, was
shown to promote breast cancer metastasis by targeting the metastasis suppressor type II
transforming growth factor-β receptor (TβR2) 62 and by suppressing HMG box-containing
protein 1 (HBP1) 63. MiR-21 is another well studied miRNA that is expressed in cells with
oncogenic characteristics 64. The high level of miR-21 expression in breast cancer represents
a significant lymph node metastasis 26, 30, and recently it was identified to promote breast
cancer invasion and metastasis by down-regulating multiple tumor suppressor genes
tropomyosin 1 (TPM1), programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) and maspin 31, modulating the
tissue inhibitor of the metalloproteinase-3 gene, whose encoding product is involved in
extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation 26, 30. MiR-21 also was demonstrated to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer compared with normal tissue, and the high expression of
miR-21 was associated with lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis 65. MiR-9 is a
well-studied metastasis activator. Its expression was found to be higher in the primary
tumors from breast cancer patients with metastasis than ones from metastasis-free
patients 29. Also, miR-9 was identified to promote breast cancer metastasis by not only
inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion of cancer cells, but also
promoting angiogenesis through down-regulating E-cadherin expression 66. A clinical study
showed that the expression of miR-9 was associated with colorectal cancer lymph node
metastasis (Bandres, 2009a). In this study, we demonstrated that miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21,
and miR-9 are regulated by NF-κB at the transcriptional levels. Inducing or repressing NFκB activities by different stimulations can alter the expression of these miRNAs
accordingly. Because SS can prevent the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, we believe that
the down-regulation of miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9, in response to SS is mediated
by NF-κB to suppress tumor cell invasion.
Increasing numbers of publications have reported that the antineoplastic activity of sulindac
and other NSAIDs is COX-independent 8–14, 67. In support of this possibility, the tumor cell
lines used in this study, MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 cells, are known to express low levels
of COX-2 68, 69. We also examined COX-2 expression using qRT-PCR but did not find

significant changes in either tumor cell line in response to treatment (data not shown). This
implies that SS inhibition of tumor cell invasion is a COX-independent process, although
further studies are required to identify alternative targets, for example, using non-COX
inhibitory derivatives of sulindac as previously reported67.
In summary, these data show that SS can inhibit tumor cell invasion by suppressing NF-κBmediated transcription of specific miRNAs that play an important regulatory role in tumor
cell invasion and metastasis. These results support further studies to determine the potential
use of sulindac for the prevention of metastasis in patients with advanced malignant disease.

HCT116 and MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 5×104 cells
and 2.5×104 cells per well, respectively, and treated with SS for a designed time. Cell
number was determined by trypan blue staining and manual counting. Growth curves were
plotted as the relative cell number compared with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) treated controls.
Invasion assay

Cell invasion was measured using the Biocoat matrigel invasion chamber kit (BD
Bioscience, Sparks, MD, USA). First, cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L of the mimic
oligonucleotides of miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, miR-9, and nonspecific control miR
(Applied Biosystems) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Then, the Matrigel coated plates

medium, 2.5×104 cells were suspended in 500 µl blank medium on the insert, and then 750
µl chemoattractant (medium with 10% FBS) was added to the 24-well chamber. Cells were
then incubated in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C for 36 h. For the measurement of invading
cells, non-invading cells were removed from the upper surface of the membrane by scraping,
and invading cells were fixed with formaldehyde and then stained with crystal violet for
counting.
Luciferase reporter constructs and luciferase assay

Author Manuscript

Primers were designed to amplify fragments of the miR-10b promoter (Supplementary Table
1), and PCR reactions were performed for 30 cycles consisting of denaturing for 10 sec at
94°C, annealing for 30 sec at 58°C and extension for 1 min at 72°C. The amplified DNA
fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified by a gel extraction kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). After digesting by MluI and XhoI (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA), these fragments were ligated into the pGL3 basic vector using T4 DNA ligase
(Promega). Reporter plasmid (150 ng) was co-transfected into HCT116 cells with 5 ng of
pRL-TK control plasmid (Promega) or 350 ng of p65 expression vector (gift from Dr.
Xianming Chen) using 1.5 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Additionally, after cotransfection for 24 h, HCT116 cells were treated with TNFα for 4 h before assessing
luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was measured by using a dual luciferase reporter
assay (Promega). The results were computed for relative luciferase activity using the ratio of
firefly Luc/Renilla Luc.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)

Author Manuscript

ChIP analysis was performed with the ChIPAb-NFκB p65 (Cat.#17-10060) and EZ-Magna
ChIP™ kit (Cat.# 17-409) from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). The procedure strictly
followed the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1 × 107 HCT116 cells were cultured in a
15-cm culture dish and stimulated with 20 ng/ml TNFα for 20 min before crosslinking using
1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich). The fixed cells were lysed, and the chromatin was
sheared by sonication using an optimized condition. The chromatin fraction was
immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C with the anti-p65 antibody and goat-anti-mouse IgG.
The DNA was extracted and purified after the immunoprecipitation. PCR amplification was
performed in a total volume of 20 µl with pre-designed primers, and the sequences of
primers are listed in Supplementary Table 1. PCR reactions were performed for 30 cycles
consisting of denaturing for 10 sec at 94°C, annealing for 30 sec at 58°C and extension for 1
min at 72°C.

Western blot assay

Author Manuscript

Total proteins were extracted from cells using RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) and
quantified with a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo). Total proteins were separated on a 10%
SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (BioRad). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk and then incubated with mouse antihuman α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), rabbit antihuman IKKβ polyclonal antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), rabbit anti-human
phosphorylated IKKβ polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), and rabbit antihuman IκBα and phosphorylated IκBα polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz) at 4°C overnight.
After washing with TBST (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, both from BioRad), peroxidase-linked secondary goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies
(Santa Cruz) were incubated with membranes for 1 h at room temperature. After washing
using TBST, the enhanced chemiluminescent substrate for detection of HRP (Thermo) was
applied, and images were captured by a Fujifilm Las-3000 imager (Fujifilm, Inc. Stamford,
CT, USA).
NF-κB immunofluorescence assay

Author Manuscript

MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 cells (1×105) were seeded in a 6-well plate overnight at 37°C
and then treated with 50 µM SS or same volume of 0.1% DMSO for 12 h. Before fixation
using 4% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich), TNFα at a concentration of 25 ng/ml was added to
the cells for 20 min. The cells were then permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 (SigmaAldrich) and blocked with 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) before incubating with p65 antibody at
4°C overnight. After washing with phosphate buffered solution, the cells were incubated
with the FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 37°C. After
washing and staining with 5 ng/ml DAPI (Invitrogen), pictures were taken using the Nikon
TE2000-U fluorescence microscope system (Nikon, Inc., Melville, NY, USA).

Figure 1. SS inhibits tumor cell invasion without affecting tumor cell growth

Author Manuscript

(A) MDA-MB-231 and (B) HCT116 cells were treated with SS at 0, 30 µM, 40 µM, and 50
µM for 36 h. The inhibition of cell invasion by SS was dose dependent, and 50 µM had a
significant effect on both MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 cells (p<0.05). The same condition
did not significantly affect cell growth (p>0.05). (C) MDA-MB-231 and (D) HCT116 cells
were treated with SS at 50 µM, and cell growth was determined after various treatment
times. The viability of both tumor cell lines was not significantly influenced until 48 h of
treatment (p<0.05). (T-test was used for determining statistical significance; * indicates
p<0.05)

Figure 2. MiRNAs mediate the SS-mediated inhibition of cancer cell invasion

Over-expression of miR-10b, miR-17, miR-21, and miR-9 by transfection of their mimics
not only can promote cell invasion in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and SUM1315
cells and human colon cancer HCT116 and HT29 cells (A), but also attenuate the inhibitory
effect of SS on invasion of tumor cells (B). (T-test was used for determining statistical

Figure 3. Induced NF-κB regulates the expression of the selected miRNAs at the transcriptional
level

After being exposed to 25ng/ml TNFα for 5h or 250µM DCA for 2h, non-treated control
and treated MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 cells were harvested for RNA isolation. QRT-PCR
was employed for examine the relative expression of pri-miR-10b, pri-miR-17, pri-miR-21,
and pri-miR-9. A p65 construct was transiently transfected into MDA-MB-231 and HCT116
cells as a positive control for NF-κB over-expression. (T-test was used for determining
statistical significance; * indicates p<0.05; ** indicates p<0.01; the error bars represent the
standard deviation)

Figure 4. NF-κB directly binds to the selected miRNAs promoters

Author Manuscript

(A) Schematic of miR-10b promoter fragments containing p65 NF-κB binding sites. DNA
fragments including two putative binding sequences of p65 (W1: −1078 to −1065; W2:
−379 to −365) and the corresponding mutated sequences (M1 and M2) were cloned. (B)
TNFα can induce the relative luciferase activity through W2 (p<0.05) but not W1. (C)
Transfection of a p65 NF-κB construct increases the relative luciferase activity via W2
(p<0.05) but not W1 (RLU means relative luminescence units; T-test was used to determine
statistical significance; * indicates p<0.05; the error bars represent the standard deviation).
(D) ChIP assay of chromatin isolated from HCT116 cells treated with 25 ng/ml TNFα for 20
min and immunoprecipitated by anti-p65 or control IgG, followed by PCR analysis with
primers targeted to the upstream sequence (299bp) of the IκBα promoter (the positive

miR-21 were tested using the previously published primer sequences 40.

Figure 5. SS prevents the translocation of NF-κB through inhibiting the phosphorylation of
IKKβ and IκB

(A)The Western blot assay showed the phosphorylation of IKKβ is decreased in both MDAMB-231 and HCT116 cells in response to SS treatment. (B) The Western blot assay showed
that the decline of phosphorylated IκBα versus the accumulation of IκBα when MDAMB-231 and HCT116 cells were treated by SS. TNFα (25 ng/ml for 20 min) was used to
stimulated the expression of nuclear NF-κB. (C) NF-κB immunofluorescence of MDAMB-231 and HCT116 cells. The conditions were as follows: (1) control; (2) treatment with
50 µM SS for 12 h; (3) treatment with 25 ng/ml TNFα for 20 min; and (4) both TNFα and
