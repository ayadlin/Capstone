BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of belinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, when added to
paclitaxel/carboplatin in the empiric first-line treatment of patients with carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP). METHODS: In this
randomized phase 2 trial, previously untreated patients with CUP were randomized to receive belinostat plus paclitaxel/carboplatin
(group A) or paclitaxel/carboplatin alone (group B) repeated every 21 days. Patients were re-evaluated every 2 cycles, and those
without disease progression continued treatment for 6 cycles. Patients in group A then continued receiving single-agent belinostat,
whereas patients in group B stopped treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS): The authors postulated
that the addition of belinostat would improve PFS from 5 months (expected with paclitaxel/carboplatin) to 8 months. RESULTS: In
total, 89 patients were randomized (group A, n 5 44; group B, n 5 45), and the demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between the 2 groups. The addition of belinostat to paclitaxel/carboplatin did not improve PFS (group A, 5.4 months [95%
confidence interval, 3.0-6.0 months]; group B, 5.3 months [95% confidence interval, 2.8-6.6 months]; P 5.85). Overall survival was
12.4 months for group A versus 9.1 months for group B (P 5.20). The response rate favored the belinostat group (45% vs 21%; P 5.02).
Belinostat resulted in a modest increase in treatment toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of belinostat to paclitaxel/carboplatin did
not improve the PFS of patients with CUP who were receiving first-line therapy, although the patients who received belinostat had a
higher investigator-assessed response rate. Future trials in CUP should focus on specific subsets, defined either by the predicted

INTRODUCTION
Carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP) is a relatively common clinical syndrome, accounting for approximately 2%
to 3% of cancer diagnoses.1 Within this heterogeneous patient group, several subsets with favorable prognoses have been
identified and derive substantial benefit from specific therapy. However, approximately 80% of patients with CUP are
not included in any of these favorable subsets, and they traditionally have received treatment with empiric combination
chemotherapy.2-9 Although some patients derive substantial benefit, the overall prognosis for this large group is relatively
poor. Standard combination regimens, often containing a platinum agent and either a taxane or gemcitabine, produce
response rates from 25% to 40%, and the median survival ranges from 8 to 11 months.2-9 Therefore, novel treatment
approaches are necessary to improve the prognosis of these patients.
The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are a new class of targeted agents with proven activity in the treatment
of several hematologic malignancies.10,11 These agents inhibit the HDACs, a group of proteins involved in DNA packaging and assembly of nucleosomes through post-translational modification of histones. Thus, the inhibition of HDACs
affects the remodeling of chromatin and plays an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.12-14

Consequently, the expression of many genes is induced,
some of which can lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in
tumor cells.12 Because the HDAC system is aberrant in a
wide variety of cancer types, the HDAC inhibitors have a
potentially broad application in cancer treatment.
Belinostat (PXD101), a potent, hydroxamate-type
pan-HDAC inhibitor, demonstrated broad-spectrum,
single-agent activity in preclinical tumor models.15,16 In

phase 1 trials, belinostat was well tolerated as a single
agent and also when added to the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin.17,18 In phase 2 trials, belinostat
demonstrated single-agent activity in T-cell lymphoma
and in advanced relapsed/refractory ovarian cancer,19,20
whereas the combination of belinostat with paclitaxel/carboplatin had activity in advanced ovarian cancer and refractory bladder cancer.18,21 The potential broad
spectrum of therapeutic activity of belinostat, as well as
the feasibility of its administration with paclitaxel/carboplatin, provides the rationale for its evaluation as treatment for patients with CUP.
In this randomized phase 2 trial, we assessed the efficacy and toxicity of treatment with belinostat plus paclitaxel/carboplatin versus a standard regimen of paclitaxel/
carboplatin alone in the first-line treatment of patients
with CUP. The final results of this randomized trial are
reported here.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This multicenter, international, randomized phase 2
study (registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00873119)
was initiated in May 2009 and was performed at 10 sites
in the United States and Europe (Supporting Table 1; see
online supporting information). This study was approved
by the institutional review boards of all participating sites
before initiating enrollment and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent to participate.
Eligibility

All patients were required to have a diagnosis of CUP after
a standard evaluation that included the following: complete medical history, physical examination, complete
blood counts, chemistry profile, urinalysis, computed tomography (chest, abdomen, pelvis), mammography (for
women with adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated carcinoma), and a directed evaluation of any symptomatic
areas. A histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, poorly
differentiated carcinoma, or squamous carcinoma was
required. Patients with poorly differentiated carcinoma
were also required to have immunohistochemical studies
to confirm the diagnosis of carcinoma and to rule out
other cancer types. Additional eligibility criteria included:
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1, or 2; measurable disease (according
to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
[RECIST] version 1.122); adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count 1500/mL, platelets
100,000/mL, hemoglobin 9.0 g/dL); adequate liver

function (serum bilirubin 1.5 times the upper limit of
normal [ULN] and aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels 3 times the ULN or 5 times the ULN if liver
metastases were present); adequate renal function (estimated creatinine clearance 45 mL/minute); and
adequate coagulation parameters. In this study, no molecular profiling was required for the purpose of either predicting a primary site or identifying “actionable”
molecular abnormalities. If profiling was performed, then
the results were not used to guide first-line treatment.
Patients with CUP were not eligible if they fell into
the subsets that had a recognized favorable prognosis with
specific treatments. No previous systemic treatment for
CUP was allowed; however, previous localized radiation
therapy or surgical procedures were acceptable. Additional
exclusion criteria included: untreated brain metastases,
significant coexistent medical conditions (eg, active infections, cardiovascular disease, other cancers) that would
impair the ability to administer study treatment, a baseline QTc interval >450 msec, and grade >1 peripheral
neuropathy.
Pretreatment Evaluation

The large majority of required pretreatment evaluations
were included in the evaluation necessary to define CUP,
as described above. In addition to these procedures, the
following prestudy evaluations were required: computed
tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain
(if there were clinically suspected metastases), electrocardiogram, determination of ECOG performance status,
pregnancy test (for women of child-bearing potential),
and coagulation studies (prothrombin time, partial
thromboplastin time).
Treatment

Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either
belinostat plus paclitaxel/carboplatin (group A) or paclitaxel/carboplatin alone (group B). Patients were stratified
according to study country (United States, France, Germany, Denmark), performance status (ECOG 0 or 1 vs
2), and lactate dehydrogenase level (normal or low vs
>ULN). Randomization was performed centrally using a
randomization schedule generated by the sponsor. This
study was not blinded.
Patients in both groups received treatment in 21-day
cycles. Patients in group A received belinostat 1000 mg/
m2 (as a 30-minute intravenous infusion) on days 1, 2,
and 3 followed by oral belinostat 2000 mg (in a flat dose)
on days 4 and 5. Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (as a 1-hour to 3hour intravenous infusion) and carboplatin at an area
1656

under the concentration time curve of 6.0 (as a 30-minute
to 60-minute intravenous infusion) were administered on
day 3 after the infusion of belinostat. Patients in group B
received paclitaxel and carboplatin on day 1 of each 21day cycle at doses identical to those received by group A.
Six treatment cycles were planned in responding patients.
After completing 6 cycles of treatment, patients in
group A who were benefiting from treatment continued
single-agent belinostat at a dose of 750 mg orally on days
1 through 14 every 3 weeks until disease progression or
treatment-related toxicity occurred. Patients in group B
received no further treatment after completing 6 cycles of
paclitaxel/carboplatin.
All patients received standard prophylaxis for paclitaxel hypersensitivity as well as prophylactic antiemetics
according to standard guidelines. The carboplatin dose was
calculated using the formula described by Calvert and colleagues.23 The body surface area was recalculated if body
weight changed by greater than 10% during treatment.
All patients were examined on day 1 of each cycle
and had complete blood counts, chemistry profile, and
assessment of ECOG performance status. After completing 2 cycles (6 weeks) of treatment, response to treatment
was determined using computed tomography scans of the
chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Patients who had an objective
response or stable disease continued treatment and subsequently were re-evaluated every 6 weeks.
Dose Modifications

Required dose modifications for all 3 agents were specified in the protocol. If treatment was delayed because of
toxicity, then patients were seen weekly until toxicity had
improved to grade 1. Dose reductions, if necessary,
were permanent during subsequent treatment cycles. If
any 1 of the study drugs had to be discontinued for toxicity, then patients who were benefiting from treatment
were allowed to continue treatment with the other agents.
If treatment was delayed for more than 3 weeks because of
toxicity, then study treatment was discontinued.
Blood counts on day 1 of each treatment cycle were
used to adjust doses. If the absolute neutrophil count was
1500/mL and the platelet count was 100,000/mL, then
full doses of all agents were administered. For patients
who had blood counts less than these minimum values,
treatment was delayed until counts had risen above the
minimum levels. After the first episode, the paclitaxel and
carboplatin doses were reduced by 25%, but the belinostat
dose was not reduced. If toxicity recurred, then paclitaxel
and carboplatin were reduced again by 25%, and belinostat also was reduced by 25%.

For grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity, treatment
was delayed until the toxicity improved to grade 1; the
dose of the offending agent (or agents) was then reduced
by 25%. Two dose reductions for a specific nonhematologic toxicity were allowed; if the toxicity recurred after 2
dose reductions, then treatment was discontinued. The
dose of paclitaxel was reduced by 25% if patients developed grade 2 neuropathy. Patients in group A who were
receiving belinostat had electrocardiogram monitoring on
day 3 of cycles 1 through 6. If prolongation of the QTc
interval >500 msec was detected, then patients were
monitored according to standard guidelines, and subsequent belinostat doses were reduced by 25%. Belinostat
was discontinued if patients had any life-threatening signs
or symptoms associated with QTc prolongation.

total of 88 patients (44 patients per treatment group) was
required.
PFS was defined as the interval from the date of randomization until the date of tumor progression or death
from any cause. The PFS of the 2 treatment groups was
compared using a stratified log-rank test (1-sided) with a
1-sided significance level of 10%. A nonstratified log-rank
analysis for PFS also was performed. Survival curves were
constructed using the method of Kaplan and Meier.26
OS was defined as the interval from the date of randomization until the date of death. The OS of the 2
groups was compared using a Cox proportional-hazards
regression analysis. Objective response rates were compared using 95%, 1-sided Hauke-Anderson confidence
interval (CIs).

Definition of Response

RESULTS
Between April 2009 and January 2011, 89 patients were
randomized to this trial and constituted the ITT population. Three patients were withdrawn from the study
before receiving any treatment (because of rapidly declining performance status in 1 patient, prolonged QTc interval before treatment on day 1 of cycle 1 in 1 patient, and
patient decision in 1 patient). An additional patient who
received study treatment (group B) but later was identified
as ineligible (because there was no measurable disease
according to RECIST) was also excluded from the efficacy
analyses.

All patients were evaluated every 6 weeks during and after
study treatment until disease progression was documented.
Response to treatment was measured and categorized
according to RECIST version 1.1 and was assessed by the
investigators; no centralized evaluation was planned.22
Statistical Plan

The primary study endpoint was progression-free survival
(PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival
(OS), objective response rate, duration of response, time
to progression, and treatment safety. Efficacy analyses
were performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population
(ie, all randomized patients regardless of whether they
received any study treatment) and the protocol patient
population (ie, all randomized patients who were eligible
for the protocol and received at least 1 dose of protocol
treatment). Because these analyses produced results that
were extremely similar, the protocol patient analyses are
used in this report. Corresponding efficacy analyses of
PFS and OS for the ITT population are illustrated in Supporting Figures 1 and 2 (see online supporting information). All patients who received at least 1 dose of study
treatment were included in the safety analysis.
On the basis of published data, the median PFS and
OS expected in patients with CUP who receive treatment
with paclitaxel/carboplatin are approximately 5 months
and 11 months, respectively.2,4,24,25 We postulated that
the addition of belinostat to the paclitaxel/carboplatin
combination would result in a prolongation of the median
PFS to 8 months. By using these assumptions, 60 events
were required to achieve an overall 70% power and a 1sided overall 10% a level in the primary analysis of PFS.

Patient Characteristics

Characteristics of the 89 randomized patients and for the
2 treatment subgroups are summarized in Table 1. The
median patient age was 61 years (age range, 37-79 years),
and 53% of patients were women. The large majority of
patients (94%) had good ECOG performance status (0 or
1). Fifty-six patients (63%) had adenocarcinoma. The
liver, lungs, bones, and lymph nodes were the most common sites of metastases. There were no major imbalances
in demographics or disease characteristics between the 2
treatment groups. In the overall group, 63% of patients
were in the poor-prognosis group, defined according to
Culine et al as a poor performance status and/or elevated
lactate dehydrogenase.27 Because both of these characteristics were used as stratification parameters, patients with
a poor prognosis were balanced between the 2 treatment
groups.
Treatment Received

response. A summary of the treatment received by patients
in both groups is provided in Figure 1. Forty-four patients
(51%) completed the planned 6 cycles of protocol treatment,
and there was no significant difference in the completion
rate between the 2 arms (group A, 55%; group B, 48%).
Twenty-three patients in group A received singleagent belinostat after the completion of chemotherapy.
For these patients, the median number of additional
cycles of single-agent belinostat was 3 (range, 1-53 additional cycles). Fourteen of these 23 patients (61%) discontinued belinostat because of disease progression, and the
remaining 9 patients discontinued for other reasons (toxicity in 5 patients, patient request in 2 patients, and other
reasons in 2 patients).

the 2 groups indicated no difference between groups A
and B (Fig. 2). The median PFS was 5.4 months (95%
CI, 3.0-6.0 months) in group A and 5.3 months (95%
CI, 2.8-6.6 months) in group B.
The OS curves for the 2 groups are provided in Figure 3. The median survival of patients in group A was
12.4 months (95% CI, 7.4-18.0 months) versus 9.1
months (95% CI, 6.6-10.0 months) in group B (hazard
ratio, 0.77; P 5 .20).
The investigator-assessed overall response rate was
45% in group A (19 of 42 patients) versus 21% (9 of 43
patients) in group B (P 5 .02). Six patients had complete
responses (4 patients in group A and 2 patients in group
B). The median response duration was 4.6 months in
group A and 5.3 months in group B (P 5 .65).

toxicities of the paclitaxel/carboplatin combination, as
expected. Overall, patients in group A had a higher incidence of grade 3 and 4 toxicity than patients in group B
(22 patients [52%] vs 15 patients [34%], respectively).
However, when adverse events were compared individually, only the higher incidence of vomiting in group A
approached statistical significance (17% vs 5%; P 5 .09).
Four patients in group A had severe thromboembolic
events (vena cava thrombosis or pulmonary embolism)
compared with no episodes in group B; however, none of
these events were considered treatment-related. There
were no treatment-related deaths.
DISCUSSION
The efficacy of empiric chemotherapy for patients with
CUP has improved only modestly during the last 25 years.
The introduction of several new classes of cytotoxic agents
in the 1990s (taxanes, gemcitabine, topoisomerase I
inhibitors) led to the development and testing of new
combination regimens incorporating these agents. Currently, several 2-drug combinations appear to be similar,
although they have not been directly compared in clinical
trials. These regimens produce response rates of 25% to
40%, OS in a range from 8 to 11 months, and 2-year survival rates from 15% to 20%.2-9,24,25,28 Intensification of
chemotherapy or the addition of a third agent has not substantially improved the efficacy of these regimens.3,4,29,30
In this setting, the addition of belinostat to a standard empiric CUP regimen was attractive for several reasons. Belinostat, an HDAC inhibitor, has a novel
mechanism of action and has molecular targets that are

up-regulated in a broad spectrum of cancer types. Inhibition of the family of HDACs leads to acetylation of multiple nuclear proteins; the subsequent induction of genes
involved in cell cycle regulation; and subsequent induction of growth arrest, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis.12,13,31,32 In addition to the potential for single-agent
activity, preclinical studies with HDAC inhibitors have
demonstrated synergistic activity with several cytotoxic
agents, probably by activating various proapoptotic pathways.33 Finally, belinostat is a well tolerated agent, and it
was demonstrated previously that adding belinostat to
paclitaxel/carboplatin was feasible and was associated with
only a modest increase in toxicity.18
In this randomized phase 2 trial, the addition of belinostat to the paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen did not result
in a clear demonstration of improved efficacy. PFS, the primary endpoint in this trial, was not different when the regimens were compared (median, 5.4 months vs 5.3 months;
P 5 .85). However, the investigator-assessed response rate
was significantly higher in the belinostat group (45% vs
21%; P 5 .02), perhaps suggesting a biologic effect. The
comparison of OS between the 2 groups numerically
favored the group that received belinostat (median, 12.4
months vs 9.1 months); however, the difference was not
statistically significant (P 5 .20). The difference in OS in
the absence of a PFS prolongation is difficult to interpret;
54 patients (63%) received second-line chemotherapy, but
the proportions were similar in the 2 groups. Other unrecognized imbalances in this notably heterogeneous patient
population may also have contributed to the results. Comparisons of the toxicity profiles confirmed that belinostat
can be safely added to the paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen
with only a modest increase in toxicity.

Because this study was originally designed in 2008,
several changes have occurred in the management of
patients with CUP. Gene expression profiling assays are
now available that accurately predict the tissue of tumor
origin in many patients with CUP, although results with
different assays and various patient populations have differed.34-37 Several studies have suggested that site-specific
therapy, directed by predictions made in gene expression
profiling, improves outcomes in patients predicted to
have responsive tumor types.38-41 Thus, as new targeted
therapeutic agents are introduced, optimal therapy for all
cancer types, including CUP, will require the identification of patient subsets that have molecular tumor abnormalities predictive of response to specific treatments.
Therefore, it seems unlikely that further studies of empiric
therapy for the heterogeneous group of patients with
CUP will lead to substantial improvements in therapy.
Rather, predictions of the site of origin as well as the identification and assessment of specific molecular abnormalities that carry treatment implications are most likely to be
the focus of future clinical trials.42-44
In summary, the addition of belinostat to paclitaxel/
carboplatin did not improve the PFS of patients with
CUP who were receiving first-line therapy, although
patients who received belinostat had a higher investigatorassessed response rate (45% vs 21 %; P 5 .02). The OS
comparison favored the belinostat group (median OS,
12.4 months vs 9.1 months); however, the difference was
not statistically significant (P 5 .20). Both regimens had
efficacy similar to that previously reported for multiple
modern CUP empiric regimens. Further evaluation of
belinostat for the treatment of patients with CUP is not
recommended unless specific molecular predictors of ac1660
