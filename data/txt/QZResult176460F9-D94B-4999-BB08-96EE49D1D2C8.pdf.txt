Abstract
Mutations in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the p110a catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), have
been shown to transform mammary epithelial cells (MEC). Studies suggest this transforming activity requires
binding of mutant p110a via p85 to phosphorylated YXXM motifs in activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) or
adaptors. Using transgenic mice, we examined if ErbB3, a potent activator of PI3K, is required for mutant PIK3CAmediated transformation of MECs. Conditional loss of ErbB3 in mammary epithelium resulted in a delay of
PIK3CAH1047R-dependent mammary gland hyperplasia, but tumor latency, gene expression, and PI3K signaling
were unaffected. In ErbB3-deﬁcient tumors, mutant PI3K remained associated with several tyrosyl phosphoproteins, potentially explaining the dispensability of ErbB3 for tumorigenicity and PI3K activity. Similarly,
inhibition of ErbB RTKs with lapatinib did not affect PI3K signaling in PIK3CAH1047R-expressing tumors. However,
the p110a-speciﬁc inhibitor BYL719 in combination with lapatinib impaired mammary tumor growth and PI3K
signaling more potently than BYL719 alone. Furthermore, coinhibition of p110a and ErbB3 potently suppressed
proliferation and PI3K signaling in human breast cancer cells harboring PIK3CAH1047R. These data suggest that
PIK3CAH1047R-driven tumor growth and PI3K signaling can occur independently of ErbB RTKs. However,
simultaneous blockade of p110a and ErbB RTKs results in superior inhibition of PI3K and mammary tumor
growth, suggesting a rational therapeutic combination against breast cancers harboring PIK3CA activating
mutations. Cancer Res; 73(13); 4075–85. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is the most frequently
mutated signaling pathway in cancer, affecting tumor cell
survival, proliferation, migration, and metabolism (1, 2). PI3K
is a lipid kinase composed of a p85 regulatory subunit dimerized with a p110 catalytic subunit (1, 3). The N-terminal SH2
domain of p85 binds to phosphorylated tyrosines in receptors
or adaptors; this binding relieves the p85-mediated inhibition
of p110 that, as a result, becomes activated and catalyzes the

conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), a second messenger that recruits signal transducers (Akt, PDK1, SGK, etc.) to
the plasma membrane, where they become activated (1).
The PI3K pathway is aberrantly activated by gain-of-function mutations in p110a (PIK3CA) and p85a (PIK3R1), ampliﬁcation of wild-type PIK3CA, p110b (PIK3CB), and PDK1, loss/
inactivation of the PIP3 phosphatases PTEN and INPP4B,
mutation and/or ampliﬁcation of AKT1-3, and ampliﬁcation
of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK; refs. 4, 5). Three "hotspot"
mutations have been identiﬁed in PIK3CA: E542K, E545K, and
H1047R, accounting for approximately 80% of PIK3CA mutations (2, 6, 7). PIK3CA mutations occur in approximately 40% of
breast cancers, mainly in tumors with luminal and HER2enriched gene expression (8), where they have been associated
with a more virulent phenotype and resistance to antiestrogen
and anti-HER2 therapy.
HER2/ErbB2 gene ampliﬁcation occurs in 25% of breast
cancers where it associates with poor patient outcome. The
main dimerization partner of HER2 is HER3/ErbB3. Six p85binding motifs in ErbB3 activate PI3K (9, 10). ErbB3 is essential
for PI3K activation and survival of HER2-overexpressing breast
cancer cells (9, 11, 12). Therapies that inhibit PI3K induce
ErbB3 expression and reactivation via feedback mechanisms,
which partially maintain PI3K and counteract drug action. As

such, the efﬁcacy of HER2 and PI3K inhibitors is improved by
coinhibition of ErbB3 (11, 13, 14).
In addition to ErbB2/ErbB3, other RTKs activate PI3K via
insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and Gab family molecules.
These adaptors lack enzymatic activity, but when tyrosine
phosphorylated by RTKs, they recruit p85 (PI3K) and other
signaling molecules (15, 16). Activated RTKs, including insulin
and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptors, VEGF receptor
(VEGFR), EGF receptor (EGFR), and ALK recruit IRS adaptors
(16, 17). IRS-1 has 9 p85-binding motifs (18) and, like ErbB3,
strongly activates PI3K. Similarly, Gab1 and Gab2 contain 3
p85-binding motifs and are tyrosine phosphorylated by ErbB2,
MET, Abl, FGFR, EGFR, and Src kinases (15). The p85 subunit
was discovered by its association with platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR), a potent activator of PI3K
(19). Biochemical analyses have shown that both PIK3CAE545K
and PIK3CAH1047R exhibit approximately 2-fold higher catalytic
activity than wild-type PI3K. The association of PIK3CAH1047R
with PDGFR or IRS-1 phosphopeptides further increases the
catalytic activity of the mutant enzyme (20). In addition,
PIK3CAH1047R association with p85 is required for transformation induced by mutant PI3K (6, 21). These data suggest a role
for upstream RTKs in the signaling output of mutant PI3K,
leading us to hypothesize that mutant PIK3CA requires
upstream adaptors, such as ErbB3, to induce epithelial transformation and tumor progression.
We show herein that mammary gland hyperplasia induced
by temporally regulated expression of mutant PIK3CA was
delayed in mice lacking ErbB3 in the mammary epithelium. In
contrast, tumor formation and PI3K activity were unaffected
by ErbB3 ablation. In tumors expressing ErbB3, mutant PI3K
associated with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins,
including ErbB3. In tumors lacking ErbB3, PI3K still associated
with other upstream adaptors and RTKs. Inhibition of RTKs or
adaptors known to activate PI3K did not block cell growth or
PI3K activity in mammary tumors or PIK3CA-mutant human
breast cancer cells. However, simultaneous inhibition of
upstream RTKs and mutant p110a more potently inhibited
tumor growth and PI3K signaling than inhibition of p110a
alone. These data suggest that mutant PIK3CA still relies upon
upstream activators and combined inhibition of PI3K and
these activators is a rational treatment strategy against tumors
harboring PIK3CA-activating mutations.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
MDA-MB-453 and T47D cells were from American Type
Culture Collection. MDA-MB-453 were authenticated in
March 2013 by short tandem repeat DNA analysis (DDC
Medical); authentication of T47D cells (March 2011) has
been described previously (22). CAL-148 and BT20 cells were
provided and authenticated as described previously (23). All
cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
(DMEM) with 10% FBS (Life Technologies). EZN-3920 and
EZN-4455 are locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense molecules
provided by Enzon Pharmaceuticals (11, 24); they were
resuspended in sterile PBS to a stock concentration of 5
mmol/L and applied to cells at 5 mmol/L in the absence of

transfection reagent. EZN-3920 targets ErbB3 and EZN-4455
is a scrambled control antisense. BYL719 (25) and LJM716
(26), provided by Novartis, were resuspended to a stock
concentration of 1 mmol/L in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or
10 mg/mL in sterile PBS, respectively. siRNA (Qiagen) were
transfected at a ﬁnal concentration of 50 nmol/L total siRNA
using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's protocol (see Supplementary Methods). The duration and concentration of each drug or siRNA
treatment is described with each ﬁgure. Media and inhibitors were replenished every 3 days. Colony growth was
assessed by plating cells and staining with crystal violet as
detailed in Supplementary Methods.
Mice
To generate the iPIK3.iCre.ErbB3FL/FL model on a congenic FVB background, the following FVB mouse strains
were interbred: MMTV-rtTA (27), Tet-Op-HA-PIK3CAH1047RIRES-Luc (28), Tet-Op-Cre (29), and ErbB3FL/FL (30) as
described in Supplementary Methods. Details of tumor
transplantation are also provided in Supplementary Methods. Brieﬂy, harvested tumors were homogenized in serumfree media with gentleMACS C Tubes (Miltenyi Biotec) and
resuspended in 7 mL Matrigel diluted with 50% PBS. Tumor
homogenates (100 mL) were injected into both inguinal (#4)
mammary fat pads of 4-week-old female athymic mice
(Harlan Laboratories) using a 25-gauge needle. When tumors
reached 125 mm3, mice were randomized to 4 treatment
groups as indicated in ﬁgure legends. Lapatinib di-p-toluenesulfonate salt and imatinib methanesulfonate salt were
purchased from LC Laboratories. Lapatinib, imatinib, and
BYL719 were resuspended in 0.5% methyl cellulose, 0.1%
Tween-80 for treatment by orogastric gavage. Lapatinib and
imatinib were administered twice daily at 100 mg/kg/dose
and BYL719 once daily at 30 mg/kg/dose. In the ﬁrst study,
all mice were sacriﬁced when tumors in vehicle-treated mice
exceeded 1.5 cm3. In the second study, animals with tumors
greater than 1.0 cm3 were sacriﬁced and all remaining
animals were sacriﬁced on day 21. Mice were always sacriﬁced 1 hour after drug treatment.
Protein and histologic analyses
Cell line and tumor protein lysates were prepared as
described in Supplementary Methods. Immunoprecipitation
was conducted with a p85 (Millipore) or a hemagglutinin (HA)
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) using a ratio of 1 mg
antibody: 250 mg lysate: 5 mL Dynal protein G beads (Life
Technologies) with end-over-end rotation at 4 C for 4 hours.
For immunoblot analysis, equal amounts of protein/lane were
subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed with antibodies as described in Supplementary Methods. Phospho-RTK arrays were purchased from
R&D Systems and incubated with 225 mg cell lysates following
manufacturer's directions. Details of guinea pig anti-cytokeratin 8 (RDI-Fitzgerald) and rabbit anti-cytokeratin 5 (Covance)
immunoﬂuorescent staining of tissue sections and hematoxylin staining of whole mount mammary glands are provided in
Supplementary Methods.

ErbB3 Loss Delays PIK3CA Mammary Hyperplasia

Gene expression analyses
Tumor RNA was harvested from ErbB3FL/þ and ErbB3FL/FL
iPIK3.iCre tumors and analyzed by cDNA microarray as
described previously (31, 32). Brieﬂy, RNA isolated by Qiagen
RNeasy mini kit was hybridized to Agilent custom 4  180 K
microarrays as previously described (31); the signal from iPIK3.
Cre RNA was normalized to the Herschkowitz and colleagues
murine dataset (32). The mutant PIK3CA gene signature (33)
was calculated for every genotype in the Herschkowitz and
colleagues mouse tumor dataset (32) and the iPIK3.iCre
tumors. The average gene signature scores for each tumor
class were plotted as boxplots to compare mutant PIK3CAinduced gene expression across previously deﬁned classes (32).
Statistical analyses
Signiﬁcant differences (P < 0.01) were determined by
ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc tests (multiple testing-corrected) or Student t test using Graphpad Prism software.

Results
ErbB3 inhibition sensitizes mutant PIK3CA breast cancer
cells to a p110a inhibitor
ErbB3 silencing impairs the proliferative advantage conferred by mutant PIK3CA in HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer cells
(34). However, the impact of ErbB3 in PIK3CA-mutant breast
cells lacking HER2 ampliﬁcation is less clear. We treated, MDAMB-453, T47D, BT20, and CAL-148 breast cancer cells, all
harboring PIK3CAH1047R, with the ErbB3-neutralizing antibody,
LJM716 (26), and BYL719, a p110a-speciﬁc inhibitor with an
IC50 against wild-type and mutant p110a of 5 nmol/L (25).
BYL719 decreased the proliferation (Fig. 1A–D) and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1E–H) of all 4 cell lines in a dose-dependent
fashion, suggesting p110aH1047R is a driver of proliferation
and PI3K activity in these cells. LJM716 reduced basal and
BYL719-induced total and Y1289-P-ErbB3 (Fig. 1E–H) and
enhanced BYL719-mediated growth inhibition in each cell
line (Fig. 1A–D), albeit weakly in T47D and CAL-148 cells. We
also used EZN-3920, a LNA ErbB3-targeted antisense or a
scrambled control LNA antisense, EZN-4455 (11, 24), in
combination with BYL719. EZN-3920 did not reduce ErbB3
expression in MDA-MB-453 or T47D cells (Fig. 1I). EZN-3920
reduced ErbB3 levels and BYL719-induced Y1289-P-ErbB3 in
both BT20 and CAL-148 cells (Fig. 1L and M). The combination of BYL719þEZN-3920 exhibited a better antiproliferative effect than either agent alone (Fig. 1J and K). In
addition, increased T308-P-Akt induced by EZN-3920 was
abrogated by BYL719 (Fig. 1L and M). These data suggest
that coinhibition of ErbB3 and p110a impairs the proliferative advantage conferred by mutant PIK3CA in breast
cancer cells without HER2 gene ampliﬁcation.
Loss of ErbB3 delays mammary gland hyperplasia
induced by mutant PIK3CA, but does not delay tumor
formation
To evaluate whether ErbB3 is required for PIK3CAH1047Rinduced mammary epithelial cell (MEC) transformation in
vivo, we generated transgenic mice in which doxycyclineinduced PIK3CAH1047R drives mammary tumor formation in

www.aacrjournals.org

the presence or absence of ErbB3. These mice expressed 3
transgenes [MMTV-rtTA (27), Tet-Op-HA-PIK3CAH1047R-IRESLuc (28), and Tet-Op-Cre (29)] and harbored homozygous or
heterozygous ﬂoxed ERBB3 alleles (Supplementary Fig. S1;
refs. 11, 30, 35). In this model, referred to as iPIK3.iCre,
doxycycline treatment simultaneously induced the expression
of hemagglutinin-tagged PIK3CAH1047R and Cre recombinase in
the mammary epithelium, resulting in Cre-mediated recombination of ﬂoxed ERBB3 alleles in MECs expressing PIK3CAH1047R. The internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-Luciferase
allows bioluminescent detection of cells/tissues expressing
PIK3CAH1047R.
The mammary ductal epithelium in 6-week-old ErbB3FL/þ
(control) animals extended distally past the central lymph
node, whereas the epithelium of ErbB3FL/FL mice was maintained proximal to the lymph node (Supplementary Fig. S2A;
ref. 36). At 9 weeks, the ErbB3FL/FL ductal epithelium extended past the lymph node, but remained shorter than that
of ErbB3FL/þ animals (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Mammary
ductal hyperplasia (induced by mutant PIK3CA) was not
apparent in either group at 6 or 9 weeks of age (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). By 12 weeks, ErbB3FL/þ glands
exhibited thickened, irregular ductal epithelium indicative
of hyperplasia. However, ErbB3FL/FL iPIK3.iCre glands contained smooth, normal-appearing ducts (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2C). Quantitation of epithelial content in
whole mounts showed that ErbB3FL/þ glands contained 80%
more epithelium than ErbB3FL/FL glands (Fig. 2A). Histologic
examination of mammary gland sections from 12-week-old
animals showed that the ErbB3FL/þ iPIK3.iCre glands contained multiple cell layers of ductal epithelium, whereas the
ErbB3FL/FL iPIK3.iCre epithelium was arranged in a single,
smooth cell layer (Fig. 2B).
Mice were monitored for expression of PIK3CA-IRES-Luciferase by IVIS bioluminescence imaging (Supplementary Fig.
S3). Tumor formation was monitored by mammary gland
palpation through 600 days of age. Mice lacking the iPIK3
transgene or not induced with doxycycline failed to develop
tumors or exhibit luciferase activity at any point. The mean
mammary tumor latency was 398 days in ErbB3FL/þ mice as
compared with 419 days in ErbB3FL/FL mice (P ¼ 0.72; Fig. 2C).
Loss of ErbB3 did not affect the average number of tumors per
animal: 1.75 tumors per ErbB3FL/þ mouse and 1.55 tumors per
ErbB3FL/FL mouse (P ¼ 0.71). These data suggest that loss of
ErbB3 delays early mammary hyperplasia but not cancer
formation in PIK3CAH1047R-expressing mice.
Loss of ErbB3 does not alter PI3K signaling, histology, or
gene expression in tumors induced by mutant PIK3CA
Immunoblot analysis revealed loss of ErbB3 expression in
ErbB3FL/FL tumors. All tumors expressed p110a and p85 subunits of PI3K as well as the hemagglutinin-tagged p110aH1047R
transgene. Levels of phosphorylated Akt, S6, and PDK1 were
similar in ErbB3FL/þ and ErbB3FL/FL tumors, suggesting loss of
ErbB3 did not attenuate PI3K signaling in PIK3CAH1047R-driven
mammary tumors (Fig. 2D).
Global gene expression patterns in ErbB3-deﬁcient and
-competent tumors were assessed using cDNA microarrays.

mutant PIK3CA signature score was similar in ErbB3FL/þ and
ErbB3FL/FL tumors, suggesting loss of ErbB3 did not reduce
PI3K signaling output.
Histologic examination of iPIK3 tumors revealed heterogeneous histopathologies (Supplementary Fig. S4A). The most
frequent histologies were adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma with squamous metaplasia. Squamous metaplasia occurred
more frequently in ErbB3FL/FL samples, whereas metaplastic
carcinomas and adenomyoepithelioma-like lesions were unique
to ErbB3FL/þ tumors. ErbB3FL/þ and ErbB3FL/FL tumors often
displayed cribriform architecture, but tumors with papillary
architecture occurred more frequently in ErbB3FL/FL mice and
tumors with solid architecture were only seen in ErbB3FL/þ mice
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). PIK3CA-mutant mammary tumors
have been reported to coexpress both luminal-type (i.e., CK8)
and basal-type cytokeratins (i.e., CK5; refs. 37, 38). This was seen
in ErbB3FL/þ and ErbB3FL/FL cancers (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Thus, loss of ErbB3 did not enrich for either the luminal or
basal population. These data are consistent with 2 recent reports
(28, 38).
Mutant p110a binds to ErbB3 and other tyrosinephosphorylated proteins
Because ErbB3 loss did not attenuate iPIK3.iCre tumorigenesis or PI3K signaling, we sought to determine if PIK3CAH1047R
engaged other tyrosine-phosphorylated adaptors or receptors.

We detected hemagglutinin-tagged p110aH1047R in p85 immunoprecipitates from ErbB3FL/þ and ErbB3FL/FL tumor lysates
(Fig. 3A, second and third rows). ErbB3 also coprecipitated
with p85 in ErbB3FL/þ, but not ErbB3FL/FL tumors. Several
tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins coprecipitated with p85 in
ErbB3-deﬁcient tumors (Fig. 3A). Immunoprecipitation of
mutant p110a using an anti-hemagglutinin antibody pulled
down p85 and several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in
ErbB3FL/þ and ErbB3FL/FL tumor lysates, including ErbB3 in
the ErbB3FL/þ tumors (Fig. 3B). p85 or hemagglutinin frequently coprecipitated IRS-1, a known PI3K scaffold (Fig. 3A and B).
ErbB3FL/FL tumors lacked detectable ErbB3, but expressed
EGFR, ErbB2, IRS-1, and Gab1/2 at levels similar to
ErbB3FL/þ tumors (Fig. 3C). Association of p85 with ErbB3,
Gab1, and IRS-1 in iPIK3 tumor lysates (Fig. 3D) suggests that
multiple adaptors can simultaneously engage mutant p110a,
perhaps rendering ErbB3 dispensable for activity and plasma
membrane localization of PIK3CAH1047R.
Because the PIK3CAH1047R-mutant human breast cancer cell
line T47D requires mutant p110a for growth and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1B and F), we assessed the requirement for
PI3K-activating adaptors. ErbB3 siRNA reduced coprecipitation of ErbB3 with p85, but Gab2 and IRS-1 continued to
associate with p85 following ErbB3 depletion (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, P-Akt levels were sustained following ErbB3 depletion, consistent with maintenance of PI3K signaling. We
combined siRNA-mediated knockdown of ErbB3, Gab2, and/
or IRS-1. Despite signiﬁcant reduction of all 3 PI3K adaptors,

ErbB3 Loss Delays PIK3CA Mammary Hyperplasia

Akt remained phosphorylated, suggesting that PI3K activity
was not reduced (Fig. 4B). Similarly, proliferation was not
dramatically altered by combined depletion of ErbB3, Gab2,
and IRS-1 (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that because multiple
proteins can engage mutant PI3K, depletion of ErbB3, Gab2,
and/or IRS-1 is insufﬁcient to reduce PI3K activity of tumors or
cells driven by PIK3CAH1047R.
ErbB RTK activity is dispensable in PIK3CAH1047R tumors
To determine whether RTKs other than ErbB3 are activated
in iPIK3.iCre tumors, we conducted phospho-RTK arrays. The
most prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated RTKs in both
ErbB3FL/þ and ErbB3FL/FL tumors were ErbB2, EGFR, PDGFR,
and macrophage-stimulating protein receptor (MSPR/
Ron; Fig. 5A). One of the 8 tumors exhibited high P-HGFR,
consistent with hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR;
MET) ampliﬁcation previously reported in this model (28). We
speculate the presence of these phosphorylated RTKs, all

capable of engaging PI3K, may negate a requirement for ErbB3
in iPIK3 tumors.
To determine if inhibition of EGFR, ErbB2, and PDGFR
would inhibit growth of PIK3CAH1047R-expressing mammary
tumors, we treated iPIK3.iCre tumor-bearing mice with (i)
vehicle; (ii) EGFR/ErbB2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) lapatinib; (iii) PDGFR TKI imatinib; and (iv) lapatinib þ imatinib.
Tumor growth was delayed by each single inhibitor and the
combination (Fig. 5B). P-ErbB2 and P-EGFR levels were
reduced by lapatinib, whereas imatinib inhibited P-PDGFRa
and P-PDGFRb (Fig. 5C). Imatinib-treated tumors exhibited
higher levels of P-ErbB2 and P-EGFR, which were abolished in
tumors cotreated with lapatinib. Although the combination of
imatinib and lapatinib slowed tumor growth and inhibited
ErbB/PDGFR phosphorylation, Akt and PDK1 remained phosphorylated in tumors treated with both RTK inhibitors (Fig.
5D). Pull down of p85 from tumor lysates coprecipitated IRS-1
and Gab1 as well as other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins

(Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). These data suggest that
mutant PI3K engages multiple upstream adaptors, potentially
explaining how it maintains its activity and effect on tumor
growth despite inhibition of EGFR, ErbB2, and PDGFR kinases
with a combination of small-molecule inhibitors.
Inhibition of PIK3CAH1047R-driven tumor growth by a
p110a inhibitor is enhanced by coinhibition of ErbB2/
EGFR
Data shown in Figs. 2C–F, 4, and 5B–D suggest that targeted
inhibition of signaling events upstream of PI3K, including
ErbB3, EGFR, ErbB2, PDGFR, Gab2, or IRS-1, is insufﬁcient to
silence PI3K activity and tumor growth in PIK3CAH1047R-driven
cancers. Furthermore, compensatory upregulation of signaling
networks upstream of PI3K can limit the therapeutic response
to PI3K inhibitors (13, 39). To determine if this occurs in
tumors that express PIK3CAH1047R as the pathogenic oncogene,
we treated iPIK3.iCre tumors with (i) vehicle; (ii) p110aspeciﬁc inhibitor BYL719; (iii) lapatinib; or (iv) lapatinib þ
BYL719. Although lapatinib slowed tumor growth less effectively than BYL719, the combination of lapatinib þ BYL719
inhibited tumor growth more potently than either agent alone
(Fig. 6A). Lapatinib reduced EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 phosphorylation (Fig. 6B), but did not decrease P-PDK1 or P-Akt
(Fig. 6C). BYL719 alone decreased P-Akt, but not P-PDK1. In
contrast, BYL719 þ lapatinib markedly reduced P-Akt and PPDK1 levels (Fig. 6C), suggesting a more potent suppression of
PI3K when p110a and EGFR/ErbB2/ErbB3 are inhibited simultaneously. BYL719 þ lapatinib treatment slowed the weight
gain of adolescent, tumor-bearing mice compared with mice

treated with single agent BYL719 (P < 0.01), but histopathologic
analysis revealed no liver damage in any treatment group
(Supplementary Fig. S6).
To extend these observations, 4 human breast cancer cell
lines with PIK3CAH1047R, but without HER2 gene ampliﬁcation
(MDA-MB-453, T47D, BT20, and CAL-148), were treated with
BYL719 and lapatinib. BYL719 reduced proliferation and P-Akt
in all 4 cell lines (Fig. 7). Lapatinib inhibited basal and BYL719induced phosphorylation of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 in each
cell line (Fig. 7E–H). Lapatinib inhibited the proliferation of 2
cell lines as a single agent and aided the antiproliferative action
of BYL719 in all 4 cell lines (Fig. 7A–D). Compared with singleagent treatments, the combination of BYL719 þ lapatinib
resulted in more potent inhibition of S473-P-Akt, T308-P-Akt,
and P-S6 in MDA-MB-453 cells; S473-P-Akt, P-ERK, and P-S6 in
T47D cells; P-PDK1 and P-ERK in BT20 cells; and T308-P-Akt,
P-PDK1, and P-ERK in CAL-148 cells (Fig. 7E–H). Thus, while
signaling downstream of PI3K was differentially affected by
BYL719 and lapatinib in the 4 human cell lines and iPIK3.iCre
transgenic mouse tumors, combined inhibition of p110a and
ErbB receptors resulted in a more potent antitumor effect in all
5 PIK3CAH1047R-driven models.

Discussion
PI3K is the most frequently mutated signaling pathway in
breast cancer. Most common somatic alterations in this pathway are "hot spot" mutations in the helical and catalytic
domains of PIK3CA (8). Transgenic mice with conditional
expression of PIK3CAH1047R in the mammary gland develop
mammary cancers (28). Despite exhibiting a "gain-of-function,"

mutant PIK3CA still requires binding via the regulatory subunit
p85 to phosphorylated adaptors or receptors. For example,
PIK3CAH1047R-mediated transformation of chick embryo ﬁbroblast depends on its interaction with p85 (21) and the catalytic
activity of PI3KH1047R is enhanced by coupling to phosphorylated PDGFR or IRS-1 (20). Furthermore, knockdown of ErbB3
or its ligand heregulin inhibits growth and P-Akt levels in cells
expressing PIK3CAH1047R (34). Tissue-speciﬁc deletion of ErbB3
in the mammary gland results in a delay in ductal extension
during puberty, increased apoptosis in terminal end buds
(TEB) and a reduction in P-Akt (36), suggesting ErbB3-activated PI3K has an important role in mammary gland morphogenesis. Finally, Cre-mediated deletion of ErbB3 prolonged
mammary tumor latency, reduced lung metastases and
reduced P-Akt levels in mammary tumors driven by polyomavirus middle T oncogene (PyV mT; ref. 11). In this mouse
model, PyV mT-driven tumor formation is highly dependent
upon the association of middle T with p85 (40) and this
association is lost upon deletion of ErbB3 or inhibition of
ErbB3 phosphorylation with the EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor lapa-

tinib (11). These data suggest that ErbB3 is a major activator of
wild-type and mutant PI3K in normal and transformed MECs.
Thus, we examined if ErbB3 was required for MEC transformation by mutant PI3K.
We showed herein that loss of ErbB3 delayed mammary
gland hyperplasia induced by mutant PIK3CA, but was
dispensable for mammary tumorigenesis. This is in contrast
to mammary tumors induced by the ErbB2/Neu transgene
where loss of ErbB3 blocks mammary tumorigenesis (35).
Our data are reminiscent of a recent study by Lahlou and
colleagues, in which ErbB2/Neu-mediated hyperplasia, but
not MEC transformation, was reduced by an ErbB3 mutant
incapable of binding to p85 (PI3K; ref. 41). In tumors
expressing the PI3K-uncoupled ErbB3 mutant, ErbB2 and
EGFR engaged p85 to maintain PI3K activity. The iPIK3.iCre
mice we present herein are phenotypically similar. It is
unclear why genetic ablation of ErbB3 inhibits Neu-induced
tumor formation (35), whereas uncoupling PI3K from ErbB3
does not (41), but the results suggest PI3K-independent
functions of ErbB3.

Young et al.

Inhibition of EGFR/ErbB2 or PDGFR slowed mutant PIK3CA
tumor growth without affecting Akt and PDK1 phosphorylation. This result suggests 2 not mutually exclusive possibilities.
First, many RTKs or adaptors might contribute to PI3K activation in tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations. Second, the
heightened activity of the PIK3CAH1047R kinase domain mutant
(42, 43) allows for this kinase to signal strongly with fewer/no
upstream binding partner(s). However, some upstream binding partners are likely needed because structural data suggest
that p85 inhibits the catalytic activity of p110 until the p85/
p110 complex binds to consensus phosphotyrosine YXXM
motifs in RTKs/adaptors, thus relieving p85-mediated inhibition of p110 (44). E545K mutation in PIK3CA causes a structural
change in the PI3K holoenzyme such that p85 no longer
inhibits p110a, resulting in increased PI3K activity (45), which
cannot be further activated by added tyrosine phosphorylated
peptides (20). In contrast, the high kinase activity of H1047R
PI3K doubles upon the addition of phospho-PDGFR or phospho-IRS-1 peptides (20). Finally, the transforming action of
PIK3CAH1047R, but not PIK3CAE545K, is markedly reduced by loss
of p85 binding, suggesting that PIK3CAH1047R requires binding
to RTKs/adaptors for full activity (6, 21).
The driving oncogene in iPIK3.iCre tumors is PIK3CAH1047R,
making PI3K the most compelling therapeutic target. As a
single agent, the p110a-speciﬁc inhibitor BYL719 reduced
tumor growth and P-Akt in iPIK3.iCre tumors without effecting
P-PDK1. Dual EGFR/ErbB2 and PI3K inhibition reduced P-Akt
and P-PDK1 and decreased tumor growth better than either
agent alone. These data suggest that while individual inhibition
of mutant PI3K and RTKs upstream was insufﬁcient to suppress PI3K activity and growth, ErbB inhibition signiﬁcantly
enhanced the effect of BYL719 against PI3K mutant cancers.
This was recapitulated in PIK3CAH1047R human breast cancer
cells. We speculate, however, that tumor cells not initially
eliminated by combined ErbB and PI3K inhibition may allow

mutant PI3K to engage other RTKs and adaptors, eventually
allowing tumors to evade the antitumor effect of PI3K
inhibitors.
