BACKGROUND. The rate of durable responses in embryonal and certain germ cell
tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) is unsatisfactory. Intraarterial chemotherapy and osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption (IA/BBBD) increases drug
delivery to the CNS.
METHODS. Data of patients treated with carboplatin or methotrexate-based IA/
BBBD on prospective phase 2 trials conducted at 3 centers were collected. Study
outcomes included overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), and toxicity.

RESULTS. Fifty-four patients were treated. Twenty-seven patients received IA/
BBBD as salvage treatment. The median OS was 2.8 years for all patients, 2.5

less frequently in adults.1 Of these, medulloblastomas are the most common type, accounting for
12%–25% of all CNS tumors in children, but for only
0.5%–1% of all intracranial neoplasms in adults.1,2
Supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors
(sPNETs) comprise only 1%–2% of all childhood CNS
tumors and are even less frequent in adults.3 The
mainstay of treatment for medulloblastomas and
other embryonal brain tumors has been maximal
surgical resection, craniospinal axis radiotherapy
(CSA-RT) with focal boost, and multiagent chemotherapy. Since 1970 survival in medulloblastoma
patients has markedly improved. Seventy percent,
and in some reports up to 80%, of children with this
disease can be cured, compared with approximately
50% 30 years ago.4,5 However, many patients suffer
neuropsychological sequelae and neurocognitive
decline.6,7 Furthermore, chemotherapy regimens are
usually platinum-based, and platinum agents are
associated with significant ototoxicity. This may contribute to developmental delay as well.8 Embryonal
tumors other than medulloblastoma still carry a very
poor prognosis.3,9
Primary CNS germ cell tumors are rare, constituting less than 5% of all brain tumors.1 Pure germinomas are extremely sensitive to both irradiation
and platinum-based chemotherapy, and CSA-RT
alone achieves a 5-year event-free survival of 91%.10
In contrast, nongerminomatous germ cell tumors
have an inferior prognosis when compared with pure
germinomas.11 The prognosis in germ cell tumors
with dissemination or recurrence is dismal.12
The lack of durable responses in embryonal and
germ cell tumors of the CNS treated with chemotherapy may, in part, be caused by the blood-brain
barrier (BBB).13 Intraarterial (IA) chemotherapy in
conjunction with transient osmotic BBB disruption
(IA/BBBD) has been shown to increase drug delivery
to the CNS while preserving neurocognitive functioning and minimizing systemic toxicity.13,14 Here we
report the efficacy and toxicity of IA/BBBD in 54
patients with embryonal and germ cell CNS tumors,
hypothesizing that long-term survival may be possible with IA/BBBD-enhanced chemotherapy delivery
to the entire CNS and focal or reduced-dose radiotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
Data were collected from patients with germ cell and
embryonal CNS tumors prospectively treated with
IA/BBBD on phase 2 study protocols from July 1981
to September 2006. Three centers affiliated with the

received protocol 2 first and were later switched to protocol 3.

BBBD Consortium participated. Data were extracted
from password-protected institutional databases and
verified using the patients’ records. Original pathology reports, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were reviewed
at participating centers to verify histopathologic diagnoses and radiographic tumor characteristics. Institutional Review Board approval for the release of
anonymized data was obtained from each participating center.

Treatment Protocols
All patients were treated on phase 2 protocols
approved by the individual Institutional Review
Board. An overview of all protocols is provided in Table 1. Data were prospectively collected at study
entry and at every visit during the study. Eligibility
criteria were similar in all protocols and included
histologically/cytologically confirmed CNS germ cell
or embryonal tumor; age at first treatment 75 years;
life expectancy of 90 days; negative pregnancy test
and adequate birth control methods in women with
childbearing potential; normal renal, hepatic, and hematologic functions; no uncontrolled significant
medical conditions; no radiographic signs of intracranial herniation and/or spinal cord block; no
second malignancy; and signed written informed
consent. Prior radiation or chemotherapy was
allowed. Patients with significant mass effect at the
time of protocol enrollment were given IA chemotherapy without BBBD before starting IA/BBBD.

IA/BBBD for Embryonal/Germ Cell Tumors/Jahnke et al.

The IA/BBBD technique and the concomitant supportive care have been described in detail elsewhere.14,15 Briefly, BBBD treatment was done on 2
consecutive days every 4 weeks for up to 1 year, for a
maximum of 24 treatments per patient. Under general
anesthesia a femoral artery was accessed, and either
an internal carotid or vertebral artery was catheterized
up to the level of approximately C2 in the internal carotid and C7 in the vertebral artery. In the case of multifocal disease, both internal carotid arteries and 1
vertebral artery were catheterized in an alternating
fashion to ensure homogeneous drug delivery throughout the affected brain regions. Warmed (378C) 25%
mannitol was delivered at a predetermined flow rate
of 3–12 mL/s into the intracranial artery for 30 seconds. After administration of mannitol, the IA chemotherapy agent (carboplatin or methotrexate) was
infused over 10 minutes. Intravenous chemotherapy
(cyclophosphamide and/or etoposide [phosphate]) was
begun directly after induction of general anesthesia.
As reported previously, corticosteroids were routinely used with disruption of the vertebral artery
after administration of carboplatin.15 Assessment of
tumor response was based on CT and/or MRI scans
obtained every 4 weeks before each treatment and
interpreted using the Macdonald criteria.16 Toxicity
was monitored according to the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. All patients were
monitored weekly with complete blood counts. A
biochemical liver and kidney function profile and
electrolyte assessment was done every 4 weeks. Follow-up examinations were performed according to a
standardized schedule and included physical examinations, CT, and/or MRI scans, cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) studies, and ophthalmologic evaluations.
Some patients in this study received intravenous
sodium thiosulfate (STS). A phase 1 clinical study of
STS protection against carboplatin-induced high-frequency hearing loss started in 1996.17 STS was initially given over 15 minutes, 2 hours after carboplatin.
Patients received 1 or 2 doses of STS, depending on
baseline hearing status. High-dose STS (16 or 20 g/
m2) was found to be safe and effective against carboplatin-induced hearing loss.18 In 1998, STS was
delayed to 4 hours postcarboplatin, based on new information suggesting a greater time of increased BBB
permeability than previously assumed.
Patients were removed from the IA/BBBD protocol upon disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,
or according to a patient’s or physician’s decision.

Statistical Considerations
Study endpoints included overall survival (OS) and
time to progression (TTP), each from the date of first

583

study treatment, and toxicity. Times to events were
censored using a data cutoff date (September 30,
2006) and estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product
limit method. Categorical variables that could represent possible prognostic factors for TTP and OS (age,
sex, Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS], chemotherapy or radiotherapy before IA/BBBD, radiotherapy at
any time during treatment, recurring or refractory
disease before study entry, pineoblastoma/atypical
pineocytoma histology) were evaluated with the
generalized Wilcoxon test for all patients and the supratentorial/disseminated PNET subgroup. The significance level was .05 (2-sided) for all statistical tests.

RESULTS
All Patients
A summary of all 54 patients is provided in Tables 1
(IA/BBBD treatment data) and 2 (patient characteristics). Diagnosis was established by stereotactic biopsy in 11 (20%) and resection in 42 (78%) patients.
One patient was initially diagnosed with CT/MRI
only and biopsied at recurrence. Chemotherapy regimens before IA/BBBD study entry were platinumbased in 17 (31%) patients.
A total of 789 IA/BBBD treatments were administered. Fifty-two patients were treated with combination
chemotherapy in conjunction with sequential osmotic
BBBD 24 hours apart via the internal or vertebral
arteries. Two patients were treated with IA chemotherapy only (without BBBD). Nine (17%) patients could
not be assessed for response because they had no
measurable disease at the time of enrollment into the
IA/BBBD protocol. TTP and OS for all patients were 1.2
(95% confidence interval, 0.7–1.8) and 2.8 (1.7–5.4)
years, respectively. Twelve (22%) patients are progression-free. Forty percent of patients survived 4.2 years,
and 30% survived 8.7 years (Fig. 1). OS and TTP were
significantly better in patients with a KPS 70%
(P 5 .0013 and .0070) and in those with IA/BBBD as
first-line treatment (P 5 .0059 and .029).
Treatment-related toxicities are summarized in
Table 3. No treatment-related deaths and no permanent neurologic or vascular sequelae from the IA/
BBBD procedure were observed. All 4 patients who
developed dementia and all 3 who died from delayed
neurotoxicity (age range, 1–53 years) received CSART. Patients treated after 1996 on a carboplatin-based
protocol were given delayed intravenous STS. However, the dose of STS and timing of STS delivery varied, depending on the date the patient entered the
study. Thus, patients in this study received heterogeneous STS regimens, and an accurate analysis of the
effect of STS on hearing protection was not feasible.

All patients received cranial radiation over the course of their disease.

Patients were grouped into 4 distinct histologic
classes based on the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification1 and their distinct clinical
prognosis: supratentorial and disseminated PNET
(n 5 29; 46%), medulloblastoma (n 5 12; 19%), and
germ cell tumor (n 5 13 patients; 21%). Patient characteristics, organized by histologic classes, are presented as follows and in Table 2.

Supratentorial and disseminated PNETs
Twenty-nine patients were identified in this subgroup. Pathologic diagnoses included pineoblastoma
(n 5 13), atypical pineocytoma (n 5 2), neuroblastoma (n 5 3), and other supratentorial or disseminated PNETs (n 5 11). Eleven patients (38%)
received IA/BBBD as salvage treatment. Median TTP
was 1.1 (0.8–8.4) years, and 9 (31%) patients are pro-

gression-free. Thirty percent of patients had no progression at 4.5 years. Four (14%) patients had no
progression at 111 years postinitiation of treatment.
Median OS was 2.5 (1.2–11.7) years. Forty percent
survived 4 years and 30% survived 8.7 years (Fig. 1).
OS was significantly better with pineal location
(P 5 .045) and IA/BBBD as first-line treatment
(P 5 .0036), and TTP was significantly improved with
radiotherapy before IA/BBBD (P 5 .036) and IA/
BBBD as first-line treatment (P 5 .0079). Nine (31%)
patients are alive in complete remission, and 6 (21%)
are alive 111 years after first treatment. Seven of 9
(78%) patients who are alive are without progression
after IA/BBBD treatment. All 9 survivors received
radiation, including adjuvant radiotherapy after IA/
BBBD (n 5 7), radiation at recurrence (n 5 1), and
radiotherapy both before IA/BBBD and at recurrence

Medulloblastomas
In this subgroup with 12 patients, IA/BBBD was
administered as salvage treatment in 8 (67%)
patients. Three patients survived 6.8 years (Fig. 1).
Median TTP was 0.7 (0.4–1.4) years, and all 12
patients have progressed. Median OS was 1.7 (0.7–
2.7) years. Two patients are still alive in complete
remission at 141 and 181 years, and both received
CSA-RT at recurrence.
Germ cell tumors
Thirteen patients, including 10 with pure germinomas
and 3 with nongerminomatous germ cell tumors,

were identified. Eight (62%) patients had disseminated disease at the time of study entry. Three
patients in this group received IA/BBBD as salvage
treatment. Median TTP was 2.0 (0.5–3.9) years, and 3
patients (all with pure germinomas) are without progression. Two patients have not progressed 131 years
after first treatment. Median OS was 5.4 years (2.8
years to not reached). Median TTP for the pure germinoma patients was 2.1 (1.8 to not reached) years, and
median OS was not attained in this group. TTP of the
3 patients with nongerminomatous germ cell tumors
was 0.025, 0.36, and 0.48 years, and OS was 0.027,
1.02, and 2.95 years. Of the 6 (46%) patients who are
still alive, all are in complete remission, and 4 (31%)
have survived 131 years (Fig. 1). All survivors had

DISCUSSION
IA Chemotherapy and BBBD
The role of standard chemotherapy in the treatment
of brain tumors has been limited, presumably
because the BBB prevents passage of ionized watersoluble substances with a molecular weight >180
Da.13 IA chemotherapy into selected cerebral vessels
significantly increases the intratumoral chemotherapy concentration in animal studies.13 Adding transient osmotic BBBD to the IA chemotherapy infusion
can improve delivery of the chemotherapeutic agents
outside the center of the tumor.13 A correlation of
dose intensity and survival was demonstrated in CNS
lymphoma patients treated with IA/BBBD,19 and
none of the assessed patients suffered neurocognitive
decline.14

The safety of IA/BBBD, including the preservation of neurocognitive function, has been reported
previously.14,20 Our results further support these
reports.

Supratentorial and Disseminated PNETs,
Medulloblastomas
Medulloblastomas and PNETs are classified as either
average/standard risk or high risk according to certain
prognostic factors. The latter group includes patients
with disease dissemination and all sPNETs.21,22
Patients with pineal region sPNETs had a better outcome than patients with nonpineal sPNETs in this
study, a finding consistent with the literature.23,24 The
nonexistence of a survival benefit in patients with a
high KPS also confirms previous findings.
Medulloblastoma/PNET is generally treated by
maximal surgical resection followed by CSA-RT and
adjuvant chemotherapy.4,21,25 In contrast to averagerisk medulloblastoma, sPNETs, high-risk medulloblastomas, and recurring patients still carry a poor
prognosis. The latter may contribute to the significantly lower OS and TTP in our patients who did not
receive IA/BBBD as first-line treatment. According to
current published data, children with sPNETs have
an overall 5-year survival rate of about 34%.3,9
Medulloblastoma and PNET nearly always require
cranial radiation, but many patients suffer neuropsychological sequelae and neurocognitive decline.6,7
The question whether radiation fields and doses can
be reduced by using chemotherapy is therefore of
high importance. In a pilot study with 16 medulloblastoma/sPNET patients treated with IA/BBBD
chemotherapy (among them 7 [44%] with disseminated disease), the response rate of 69% compared
favorably to 10 previously published series using conventional treatment.26 High-dose chemotherapy with
stem cell support may also be beneficial in PNET and
medulloblastoma patients, albeit at the cost of significant acute toxicity.27–30 Conventional multiagent
chemotherapy was able to cure children with earlystage, completely resected newly diagnosed medulloblastoma, but was insufficient for treatment of metastatic or incompletely resected tumors.31
Many patients in our study had adverse prognostic factors. For example, 38% of the sPNET/disseminated PNET and 67% of the medulloblastoma
patients received IA/BBBD as salvage treatment.
Considering the presence of these adverse prognostic
factors, our survival data for PNET seem promising,
and the long follow-up of this study with a plateau
in survival suggests that select patients with this diagnosis may be cured. Interestingly, the 2 long-term
survivors in the medulloblastoma group were spared

boost at recurrence. It should be noted that all survivors in the PNET/medulloblastoma group received
radiation, and patients in the PNET group who
received radiotherapy before IA/BBBD had a significantly higher TTP. This underscores the importance
of radiation in this disease. However, because of the
observation that long-term survival and even cure
may be possible with dose-intense IA/BBBD chemotherapy and adjuvant or even salvage radiation, this
approach should be investigated further, including
studies with reduced radiation fields and doses. This
suggestion is supported by the finding that 4 longterm survivors in the PNET group received focal
radiation only, thus sparing them the possible side
effects of standard CSA-RT.
This study has several limitations. The pathologic
classification of our PNET/medulloblastoma patients
in this study must be regarded with caution because
the current WHO classification for embryonal CNS
tumors1 has changed frequently in the past because
of advances in diagnostics. Furthermore, like in
many other published studies, the sample size in our
study is small, and comparison to the existing literature is difficult due to the heterogeneity of the
patient collectives.

Germ Cell Tumors
Patients with disseminated germ cell tumors, recurring disease, or nongerminomatous histology have
an unfavorable prognosis.11,12 Strategies that used
conventional intravenous chemotherapy alone were
effective in achieving remission in germ cell tumors,
but long-term outcome has been unsatisfactory.32,33
These disappointing results, coupled with the significant neurotoxicity associated with cranial radiotherapy, have led to the pursuit of alternative therapy
approaches focusing on chemotherapy. In 9 patients
with disseminated or hypothalamic germ cell tumors
treated with IA/BBBD chemotherapy, 6 were alive 19
to 60 months after diagnosis.26 Of these, 4 remained
in complete remission. In another study using highdose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue
the overall results were promising. However, only 4
of 12 (33%) nongerminomatous germ cell tumor
patients survived without evidence of disease, with a
median survival of 35 months.34
The 13 patients included in our study had an
adverse prognostic profile. Eight (62%) had disseminated disease, 3 had nongerminomatous histology,
and 3 received IA/BBBD as salvage treatment. Nevertheless, 6 of 8 (75%) assessable patients responded to
IA/BBBD. Furthermore, 5 patients without evidence
of disease at the time of study entry (3 of whom had

587

disseminated disease at diagnosis) were still in complete remission after treatment. The median OS of
5.4 years for all patients appears promising. Not surprisingly and, in accordance with the literature,11,12
survival in pure germinomas was better than in nongerminomatous tumors. All 6 survivors had pure germinomas. However, 5 had disseminated disease and
1 had recurring disease at start of IA/BBBD, indicating an unfavorable prognosis. Of the 6 patients alive
in complete remission, none has received radiotherapy upfront or adjuvantly, and all patients either
remained in or achieved a complete response after
IA/BBBD. Although the number of patients is small,
our data suggest that in patients with pure germinomas treated with IA/BBBD, radiotherapy could possibly be deferred until recurrence, and certain patients
may even be cured by IA/BBBD alone, sparing them
the side effects associated with radiation.

Conclusion
The response, survival, and toxicity data appear promising, especially when considering that many
patients carried adverse prognostic factors. A plateau
in survival curves in conjunction with the long median follow-up in this study suggests possible cure
for some patients with sPNETs and germinomas.
Long-term survival is possible with IA/BBBDenhanced chemotherapy delivery to the entire CNS
and focal or reduced-dose radiotherapy in some of
these patients. Future studies are needed to confirm
these results.
