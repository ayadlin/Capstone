Abstract
Author Manuscript

Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat containing proteins (NLRs) belong to a large
family of cytoplasmic sensors which regulate an extraordinarily diverse range of biological
functions. NLRs contribute to immunity against infectious diseases, however, dysregulation of
their functional activity leads to the development of inflammatory diseases and autoimmunity 1.
Cytoplasmic innate immune sensors, including NLRs, are central regulators of intestinal
homeostasis 2–8. NLRC3 (also known as CLR16.2 or NOD3) is a poorly characterized member of
the NLR family and was identified in a genomic screen of genes encoding proteins bearing
leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and nucleotide-binding domains 9,10. Expression of the gene encoding
NLRC3 is drastically reduced in tumour tissues of patients with colorectal cancer compared with

healthy tissues 11, highlighting an undefined potential function for this sensor in the development
of cancer. Here, we found that mice lacking NLRC3 were hypersusceptible to colitis and
colorectal tumorigenesis. The effect of NLRC3 was most dominant in enterocytes, where NLRC3
suppressed activation of the mTOR signalling pathways and inhibited cellular proliferation and
stem-cell-derived organoid formation. NLRC3 associated with phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks)
and blocked activation of the PI3K–dependent kinase AKT following engagement of growth factor
receptors or TLR4. These findings unveiled a key role for NLRC3 as an inhibitor of the mTOR
pathways mediating protection against colorectal cancer.

Previous studies have shown that NLRC3 functions as a negative regulator of signalling
pathways activated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the DNA sensor STING in response to
pathogen-associated molecular patterns or virus infection 12,13. However, the physiological
role of NLRC3 has remained largely unknown. We used an established mouse model of
colitis-associated colorectal tumor igenesis to formally investigate the role of NLRC3 in
colorectal cancer. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with azoxymethane (AOM), followed
by three rounds of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment (Extended Data Fig. 1a). All time
points referred to herein indicate the number of days after injection of AOM. The number of
tumours was quantified 80 days after injection of AOM. Real-time qPCR analysis revealed a
reduction in the expression of the gene encoding NLRC3 in tumour tissues compared with
non-tumour-associated tissues in the colon of wild-type (WT) mice 80 days after injection of
AOM (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

We treated cohorts of co-housed WT and Nlrc3−/− mice with AOM followed by three rounds
of DSS and examined the prevalence of tumours in the colon of these mice 80 days after
injection of AOM (Extended Data Fig. 1a, c). We found that Nlrc3−/− mice lost more body
weight after the first two rounds of DSS and developed significantly more tumours
compared with WT mice (Fig. 1a – d). Histological hallmarks associated with thickening of
the colon, inflammation, ulceration, hyperplasia and the extent or severity of damage were
more frequently identified in the middle and distal colon and the rectum of Nlrc3−/− mice
compared with the corresponding regions in WT mice (Fig. 1e and f and Extended Data Fig.
1d). All of the Nlrc3−/− mice suffered high-grade dysplasia, whereas WT mice suffered lowgrade dysplasia (Extended Data Fig. 1e). We found 63% of the Nlrc3−/− mice being positive
for adenocarcinoma in the colon compared with 0% of the WT controls 80 days after
injection of AOM (Extended Data Fig. 1f). Although NLRC3 showed a gene dose dependent
response to AOM and DSS (Fig. 1g), it does not appear to have an effect on the normal
mouse intestine or colon (Extended Data Fig. 1g).

Nlrc3−/− mice lost significantly more body weight and suffered more severe shortening of
and damage to the colon after only single round of DSS treatment than their WT
counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 2a – c). Certain members of the NLR family can form an
inflammasome to drive maturation of IL-18, a cytokine important for mediating protection

against colitis-associated tumorigenesis 2–4,14. We did not observe differential production of
IL-18 in WT and Nlrc3−/− mice 14 and 80 days after injection of AOM (Extended Data Fig.
2d). Instead, production of the other inflammasome-associated cytokine IL-1β and
inflammasome-independent cytokines IL-6, TNF and G-CSF and the chemokines KC (also
known as CXCL1), MCP-1 (also known as CCL2) and MIP-1α (also known as CCL3) was
elevated in colon tissues of Nlrc3−/− mice compared with WT mice 14 days after injection of
AOM (Extended Data Fig. 2d – g). We further confirmed these results and found increased
levels of circulating IL-6, G-CSF, KC and MIP-1α in the sera of Nlrc3−/− mice compared
with WT mice 14 days after injection of AOM (Extended Data Fig. 2h). The expression of
IL-17 and IL-22 was also elevated in the colon tissues of Nlrc3−/− mice compared with WT
mice 14 days after injection of AOM, whereas the expression of IL-23, IFN-β and IFN-γ
remained unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 3a). In agreement with the observation that
Nlrc3−/− mice had elevated levels of many pro-inflammatory mediators 14 days after
injection of AOM, we observed increased phosphorylation of IκBα and STAT3 in the colon
tissues of Nlrc3−/− mice compared with WT mice (Extended Data Fig. 3b). However,
differential phosphorylation of ERK was not observed (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Global
increases in the production of inflammatory mediators and activation of immune signalling
pathways reflected the hypersusceptibility of Nlrc3−/− mice to colitis.

We used flow cytometry to profile the immune cell populations in the colons of untreated
WT and Nlrc3−/− mice (day 0) and WT and Nlrc3−/− mice 8 and 14 days after injection of
AOM. We observed increased number of macrophages and NK cells in the colons of
Nlrc3−/− mice compared with WT mice 14 days after AOM and DSS treatment (Extended
Data Fig. 3c and d), which is consistent with the increased levels of inflammation observed
at this time-point. However, we did not observe differences in the relative number of
macrophages, CD11b+CD11c+ cells, neutrophils, B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and
NK cells between untreated WT and Nlrc3−/− mice or between WT and Nlrc3−/− mice 8
days after injection of AOM (Extended Data Fig. 3d). NLRC3 has been implicated in the
regulation of T cell activation 10, however, we did not observe a difference in the levels of
IFN-γ+ or TNF+ CD4+ T cells when WT and Nlrc3−/− splenocytes were stimulated with
CD3 and CD28 in the presence of IL-2 (Extended Data Fig. 3e).

We performed bone-marrow chimera studies to identify the contribution of NLRC3 in
haematopoietic cells versus radio-resistant stromal cells during colitis-associated
tumorigenesis. As expected, Nlrc3−/− mice which received Nlrc3−/− bone marrow were more
susceptible to tumorigenesis compared with WT mice which received WT bone marrow
(Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 4a). However, Nlrc3−/− mice which received WT bone
marrow had significantly increased tumour burden compared with WT mice which received
WT bone marrow. In addition, WT mice which received Nlrc3−/− bone marrow had
significantly increased tumour burden compared with WT mice which received WT bone
marrow (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 4a). We further confirmed our findings and
generated mice lacking NLRC3 specifically in haematopoietic cells (Vav1CreNlrc3fl/fl), cells
of the myeloid lineage (LysMCreNlrc3fl/fl), and intestinal epithelial cells (VilCreNlrc3fl/fl).
Mice lacking NLRC3 in intestinal epithelial cells developed the highest number of tumours,
followed by mice lacking NLRC3 in haematopoietic cells (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig.
4b). Mice lacking NLRC3 in cells of the myeloid lineage had a similar number of tumours

compared with WT mice (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 4b). These data supported the
observation that the inhibitory effect of NLRC3 is more dominant in intestinal epithelial
cells, whereas its effect is more subtle in haematopoietic cells.

Author Manuscript

A closer examination of intestinal epithelial cells of Nlrc3−/− mice revealed significantly
increased numbers of both Ki67+ and PCNA+ cells per intestinal crypt compared with WT
mice 14 days after injection of AOM (Fig. 2a). In addition, colonic epithelial stem cells
harvested from Nlrc3−/− mice more readily developed into organoids in ex vivo culture
compared with those harvested from WT mice (Fig. 2b). The average diameters of the
organoids derived from Nlrc3−/− mice were significantly increased compared with the
average diameters of the organoids from WT mice (Fig. 2b). Expression of the gene
encoding the stem cell marker LGR5 in the colon tissues was similar between WT and
Nlrc3−/− mice (Extended Data Fig. 4c), suggesting that the differences in the number and
size of intestinal organoids was because of differential colony-forming capacity rather than
differences in the numbers of starting intestinal stem cells. To more directly investigate the
effect of NLRC3 on cell proliferation, we overexpressed NLRC3 in the human colon cell
line HCT116 and found reduced proliferation in these cells compared with cells expressing a
control GFP protein (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, primary Nlrc3−/− fibroblasts proliferated more
rapidly than did WT fibroblasts (Fig. 2d).

Cellular proliferation can also be achieved when growth factors, nutrients and cellular
energy activate metabolic pathways via the kinase known as mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) 15. We found increased phosphorylation of the mTOR downstream targets S6, 4E–
BP1 and AKT at S473 in the colon tissues of Nlrc3−/− mice compared with WT mice 14
days after injection of AOM (Fig. 3a, b). Increased phosphorylation of these mTOR targets
was also observed in Nlrc3−/− organoids compared with WT organoids (Fig. 3c, d).
However, we found no difference in the expression of genes encoding the Wnt signalling
pathway, including WNT, β-catenin, LEF1, TCF4, TCF7 and AXIN-2 in colon tissues
between WT and Nlrc3−/− mice prior to treatment or 14 days after injection of AOM
(Extended Data Fig. 4c). The extent of nuclear localisation of β-catenin was also similar
between WT and Nlrc3−/− mice (Extended Data Fig. 4d).

Dysregulation of the mTOR signalling pathways in Nlrc3−/− mice occurred very early – 8
days after injection of AOM, whereas no difference in the production of inflammatory
cytokines and mediators and phosphorylation of IκBα was observed at this time-point
(Extended Data Fig. 5, a–c). In addition, the differential AKT-mTOR signalling at this time
point was not caused by differences in the relative levels of immune cells recruited to the
colon (Extended Data Fig. 3d). These data suggested that dysregulated mTOR signalling
observed at an earlier time point may lead to increased NF-κB signalling at a later time
point.
Phosphorylation and activation of mTOR is driven by a number of upstream signalling
proteins in the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway. Phosphorylation of AKT at the T308 site by the
kinase PDK1 licenses the ability of AKT to activate mTOR 16–18. To examine whether
NLRC3 directly affects the apical molecules in the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway, we first
investigated the phosphorylation status of AKT at the T308 site. We observed elevated

phosphorylation of AKT at the T308 site in the colon tissues of Nlrc3−/− mice compared
with WT mice 14 days after injection of AOM (Fig. 3e). Increased phosphorylation of AKT
in colon tissues was found predominately in epithelial cells, and to a lesser extent, in
infiltrating cells (Fig. 3f). Similarly, increased phosphorylation of AKT at T308 was
observed in Nlrc3−/− organoids treated with IGF-1 compared with WT controls (Fig. 3g, h).
We further observed increased activation of PDK1 in the colon tissues of Nlrc3−/− mice
treated with AOM and DSS compared with WT mice (Fig. 3e). In addition, the elevated
phosphorylation of AKT at T308 and of 4E–BP1 were found in the colon of Nlrc3+/–
heterozygote mice compared with littermate WT mice 14 days after injection of AOM, albeit
not as elevated as that observed in littermate Nlrc3−/− mice (Extended Data Fig. 6a). The
gene-dose-dependent effect of NLRC3 on the suppression of the mTOR signalling pathways
was largely reminiscent of the gene-dose-dependent effect of NLRC3 on the suppression of
tumorigenesis (Fig. 1g).

Activated mTOR is phosphorylated and migrates to lysosomal and late endosomal
membranes 19,20. Indeed, we observed increased phosphorylation of mTOR in the colon
tissues of Nlrc3−/− mice (Fig. 3e). We also found an increased co-localisation frequency
between mTOR and LAMP1 puncta in IGF-1-treated primary Nlrc3−/− fibroblasts compared
with untreated primary WT fibroblasts (Fig. 4a). Increased mTOR signalling was observed
in Nlrc3−/− fibroblasts or WT fibroblasts treated with si-RNAs against the gene encoding
NLRC3 compared with their corresponding controls (Extended Data Fig. 6b – e and Fig. 7,
a–d).

We further investigated whether NLRC3 can restrict proliferation in a spontaneous mouse
model of colon cancer. We crossed the mouse line containing a heterozygous mutation in the
gene encoding adenomatous polyposis coli (ApcMin/+) with Nlrc3−/− mice and found that
ApcMin/+ Nlrc3−/− mice had a higher tumour burden than ApcMin/+ control mice (Extended
Data Fig. 8a). 40% of the ApcMin/+ Nlrc3−/− mice developed hyperplasia compared with
none in the littermate control group and that ApcMin/+ Nlrc3−/− mice had increased damage
in the colon (Extended Data Fig. 8b, c). Importantly, we observed increased number of
Ki67+ proliferative cells and cells positive for phosphorylated S6 in the colon of ApcMin/+
Nlrc3−/− mice compared with Apc Min/+ mice (Extended Data Fig. 8c). Further, ApcMin/+
Nlrc3−/− intestinal stem cells had a greater capacity to proliferate into organoids compared
with that of ApcMin/+ intestinal stem cells (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Treatment with the
phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 and mTOR inhibitor rapamycin
impaired the ability of intestinal stem cells to proliferate into organoids (Extended Data Fig.
8d). Treatment of the ApcMin/+ mice and ApcMin/+ Nlrc3−/− mice with the PI3K–mTOR
inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 reduced the tumour burden and phosphorylation of S6 in the tumors
and enterocytes of ApcMin/+ Nlrc3−/− mice to a level observed in treated ApcMin/+ mice (Fig.
4b and c). Collectively, these data suggested that NLRC3 restricts proliferation via the
PI3K–mTOR axis during colon tumorigenesis.
Following generation of inositol phospholipids by activated Class IA PI3Ks, AKT is
recruited to the cell membrane where it undergoes a conformational change and
phosphorylation at T308 by PDK1 16–18. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that
NLRC3 weakly interacted with PDK1 and did not interact with AKT (Fig. 4d). Instead, we

found NLRC3 co-immunoprecipitated with p85 subunits of Class IA PI3Ks (Fig. 4d). In
addition, we found increased interaction between the p85 and p110α subunits of PI3K in
Nlrc3−/− primary fibroblasts or mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs)
(Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). We also found a higher level of phosphorylation and activation of
p85 PI3K in the colon tissues of Nlrc3−/− mice treated with AOM-DSS compared with WT
mice (Fig. 4e). These data provided evidence to suggest that NLRC3 disrupted an
association between the PI3K p85 and p110α subunits and reduced the activity of PI3K p85
itself. Deletion of the CARD, NACHT or LRR domain of NLRC3 impaired the ability of
NLRC3 to interact with either the PI3K p85 or p110α subunit (Extended Data Fig. 9, c–g).
Reconstitution of NLRC3 in Nlrc3−/− fibroblasts reduced phosphorylation of AKT T308 and
other downstream molecules to levels similar to that found in WT fibroblasts upon
stimulation with IGF-1 (Fig. 4f).

Author Manuscript

In addition to growth factor receptors, activation of TLR4 can engage the PI3K–AKT–
mTOR pathway 21–23. Indeed, we found a increased activation of the mTOR signalling
pathways in LPS-treated primary Nlrc3−/− BMDMs compared with LPS-treated WT
BMDMs (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). We further confirmed our findings in an independently
generated line of NLRC3-deficient mice, called Nlrc3ld/ld mice (NLRC3 large deletion, data
not shown, see Methods section). These findings collectively unveiled NLRC3 as an
inhibitory sensor of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway mediating protection against
tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (Extended Data Fig. 10c).

Author Manuscript

The biological importance of NLRC3 in the host is not confined to cancer and infectious
diseases. A previous study has shown that expression of NLRC3 is down-regulated in
patients with the autoimmune disease Wegener’s granulomatosis 24. Moreover, a loss-offunction mutation in the gene encoding the NLRC3-like protein in zebrafish results in
systemic inflammation 25. These findings collectively provide evidence to support a crossspecies functionality of NLRC3. Whether NLRC3 requires binding to a specific ligand or
that NLRC3 is engaged in a ligand-independent manner in the activation of its regulatory
function remains to be explored. Understanding the precise functions of NLRC3 could open
up new avenues for the treatment of infectious disease, autoinflammation and cancer.

Methods
Mice

WT (C57BL/6) and Nlrc3−/− mice were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free
conditions at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, USA. To generate the Nlrc3−/− mice,
exons 2 and 3 of the gene encoding NLRC3 (2.5 kb) were excised, which resulted in
deletion of 661 amino acids encoding the N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (also
known as CARD) and the central nucleotide-binding domain (also known as NACHT) of
NLRC3. Splicing of exon 1 and exon 4 led to a frameshift, generating a premature stop
codon (Extended Data Fig. 1c). The targeting vector ROS1-HR was linearized and
transfected into embryonic stem (ES) cells. Cells positive for the targeting vector were
selected by their resistance to 200 µg/ml of G418 and further screened for 5’ and 3’
homologous recombination. ES cell clones with the correct targeting events were used for
blastocysts injection. CMV-Cre mice were used to delete the conditional Nlrc3-floxed allele

conditional Nlrc3-floxed allele in a cell-type-specific manner. Expression of NLRC3 in WT
and Nlrc3−/− mice were confirmed by genomic PCR amplification (Extended Data Fig. 1c).
Nlrc3−/− mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6 for 9 generations.

Nlrc3ld/ld (NLRC3 large deletion) mice were generated by injection of 2 single guide RNAs
(Nlrc3-Guide-01: ATTCCCAGGTCGTCTTAGGC [125 ng/µl] and Nlrc3-Guide-02:
AGTGGAACAGCACAGTTCGC [125 ng/µl]), designed to introduce DNA double-strand
breaks into intron 1 and intron 3 of the Nlrc3 gene, together with a codon optimized Cas9
mRNA transcript (50 ng/µl) into the cytoplasm of the pronuclear stage C57BL/6J zygotes
(Transgenic Core Unit, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital). Injected embryos were
surgically transplanted into oviducts of pseudo pregnant CD1 females and newborn mice
bearing the intron 1 to intron 3 deletion (~3.8kb) were identified by the amplification of a
1.1 kb fragment using primers flanking the 2 break sites: Nlrc3-F51:
AGAGTGGTGCCATCTTCTGC and Nlrc3-R32: CTCAAGTCAGGGCAGCATGA. Sanger
sequencing of the ~1.1 kp amplicon confirmed proper deletion of the 3.8 kb fragment
containing exon 2 and 3. The sgRNAs and Cas9 mRNA transcript were designed and
generated as described previously 26. Potential off-target sites were identified using CasOFFinder 27, amplified by PCR and sequenced. No off-target site cleavage was observed.
Two founder mice were used to establish the mouse lines. Animal study protocols were
approved by the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Committee on Use and Care of

Male and female mice were used at the age of six weeks. For cohousing experiments, WT
and Nlrc3−/− mice were co-housed for three weeks and separated prior to injection of AOM.
We also performed experiments whereby WT and Nlrc3−/− mice were co-housed for three
weeks prior to injection of AOM and were remained co-housed over the course of the
experiments. In both cases, the results did not differ. Mice were injected intraperitoneally
with 10 mg of AOM (A5486, Sigma) per kg body weight according to previously
established protocols 7,28. Five days later, 2% DSS (9011-18-1, Affymetrix eBioscience)
was given in the drinking water for 6 days followed by regular drinking water for 2 weeks.
This cycle was repeated twice with 1.5% DSS and mice were sacrificed on Day 80
(Extended Data Fig. 1a). For Day 8 samples, mice were injected with AOM, and after 5
days, fed with 2% DSS for 3 days before mice were harvested. For Day 14 samples, mice
were injected with AOM, and after 5 days, fed with 2% DSS for 6 days. Mice were then fed
with regular water for 3 days and harvested. Bone-marrow chimera studies were performed
as described previously 7. No randomization or blinding was performed.

Colons were rolled into a “Swiss roll” and fixed in 10% formalin, processed and embedded
in paraffin by standard techniques. Longitudinal sections of 5 µm thick were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined by a pathologist blinded to the experimental
groups. Colitis scores were assigned based on inflammation, ulceration, hyperplasia and the
extent or severity of damage. Severity scores for inflammation were assigned as follows: 0 =
normal (within normal limits); 2 = minimal (mixed inflammation, small, focal or widely
separated, limited to lamina propria); 15 = mild (multifocal mixed inflammation, often
extending into submucosa); 40 = moderate (large multifocal lesions within mixed
inflammation involving mucosa and submucosa); 80 = marked (extensive mixed
inflammation with edema and erosions; 100 = severe (diffuse inflammation with transmural
lesions and multiple ulcers). Scores for ulceration were assigned as follows: 0 = normal
(none); 2 = minimal (only one small focus of ulceration involving fewer than 5 crypts); 15 =
mild (a few small ulcers up to 5 crypts); 40 = moderate (multifocal ulcers up to 10 crypts; 80
= marked (multifocal to coalescing ulcers involving more than 10 crypts each); 100 = severe
(extensive to diffuse with multiple ulcers covering more than 20 crypts each). Scores of
hyperplasia were assigned as follows: 0 = normal; 2 = minimal (some areas with crypts
elongated and increased mitoses); 15 = mild (multifocal areas with crypts elongated up to
twice the normal thickness, normal goblet cells present); 40 = moderate (extensive areas
with crypts up to 2 times the normal thickness, reduced goblet cells); 80 = marked (mucosa
over twice the normal thickness, hyperchromatic epithelium, reduced or rare goblet cells,
possibly foci of arborization); 100 = severe (mucosa twice the normal thickness, marked
hyperchromasia, crowding or stacking, absence of goblet cells, high mitotic index and
arborization). Scores of extent were assigned as follows: 0 = normal (rare or inconspicuous
lesions); 2 = minimal (less than 5% involvement); 15 = mild (multifocal but conspicuous
lesions, 5 to 10% involvement); 40 = moderate (multifocal, prominent lesions, 10 to 50%
involvement); 80 = marked (coalescing to extensive lesions or areas of inflammation with
some loss of structure, 50 to 90% involvement); 100 = severe (diffuse lesion with effacement
of normal structure, over 90% involvement). The proliferating cells in the intestinal
epithelium were detected by immunoperoxidase staining for Ki67 and PCNA. The
immunohistochemistry antibodies used were: Ki67 (NBP1–40684, Novus), PCNA (M0879,
DAKO), β-catenin (610154, BD), P-AKT Ser473 (4060, Cell Signalling), and P-S6
Ribosomal Protein Ser235–236 (4858, Cell Signalling). Tissues were counterstained with
haematoxylin. The number of Ki67+ or PCNA+ cells per crypt in each animal was counted
(at least 18–20 crypts per mouse).

Colon organoid culture

Author Manuscript

Mouse colon stem cells were cultured using IntestiCult Organoid Growth Media according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (06005, STEMCELL Technologies). The whole colon was
removed from untreated WT and Nlrc3−/− mice and rinsed with cold PBS. The colon was cut
into 2 mm segments and washed 20 times with cold PBS. Colonic segments were incubated
in Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (07174, STEMCELL Technologies), rotated at 350 g
for 15 min at room temperature, followed by resuspension in 0.1% BSA (A6003, Sigma) in
PBS. Dissociated colonic crypts were filtered through 70-µm strainers. Dissociated colonic
crypts were resuspended in DMEM/F12 medium with 15 mM HEPES (36254, STEMCELL
Technologies), counted and resuspended in Intesticult Organoid Growth Media and Matrigel
(356230, Corning) in a 1:1 ratio. Cells were plated in 24-well culture plates (3738, Corning).
Intesticult Organoid Growth Media were added to the cell culture plates to immerse the
matrix composed of Intesticult Organoid Growth Media and Matrigel. For inhibition studies,
50 µM of LY294002 (440202, Millipore) or 10 µg/ml rapamycin (553210, Sigma) was added
to the Intesticult Organoid Growth Media.

Retroviral transduction

Author Manuscript

Human or mouse MSCV-NLRC3-IRES-GFP or MSCV-IRES-GFP was co-transfected with
a retroviral packaging plasmids (pPAM-E and VSV-G) into HEK293T cells using Xfect
Transfection Reagents (631318, Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). Virus-containing media were
collected 48–72 h later and passed through a 45-µm filter. Primary ear fibroblasts or
HCT116 cells were transduced with control or NLRC3-encoding retroviral vectors. Cells
expressing GFP were selected by flow cytometry.
Generation of cells expressing NLRC3 and its deletion mutants

Author Manuscript

Plasmids pVSVg, pEQ-Pam3(−E) and pMIGII encoding the mouse Nlrc3 gene and deletion
mutants were transfected into L929 cells to generate retroviral stocks. Domains were
annotated in accordance to the NCBI Conserved Domain (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi). Retroviral supernatants were harvested after 48 h of transfection
and filtered through 0.4 µm filters. L929 cells were infected with the retroviral stocks in the
presence of polybrene to generate cells stably expressing either WT NLRC3 or NLRC3
deletion mutant proteins.
Co-immunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

Cells were collected with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer composed of 50 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were
cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 10 min. For
immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with 3 µg of primary antibodies at 4 °C for
12–16 h on a rocking platform, followed by incubation with Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose
(sc-2003, Santa Cruz) for a further 2 h on a rocking platform. The immunoprecipitated
products were washed three times with lysis buffer and eluted using 2× SDS sample buffer
and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min.
Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism 6.0 software was used for data analysis. Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m.
Statistical significance was determined by t tests (two-tailed) for two groups or One-way
ANOVA (with multiple comparisons tests) for three or more groups. P<0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

it generates a 4804-bp PCR fragment for the WT allele and a 2309-bp fragment for the
knockout (KO) allele. However, “PCR1” cannot differentiate heterozygote (HT) and KO
mice because the KO 2309-bp fragment outcompeted the WT 4804-bp fragment. Therefore,
