Systemic Therapy for Advanced Soft Tissue
Sarcomas
Highlighting Novel Therapies and Treatment Approaches
Richard F. Riedel, MD

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a rare, heterogeneous group of solid tumors in need of improved therapeutic options.
First-line chemotherapy is considered the current standard of care for patients with advanced, symptomatic STS, but
the median survival is only 8 to 12 months. Efforts to increase response rates by using combination or dose-dense
regimens have largely failed to improve patient outcomes. However, increasing evidence supports the use of specific
treatments for certain histological subtypes of STS, and novel therapies, including tyrosine kinase and mammalian
target of rapamycin inhibitors, are currently under active investigation. In addition, novel treatment approaches (such
as maintenance therapy) designed to prolong the duration of response to chemotherapy and delay disease progression are being explored. This article provides an overview of current systemic therapies for patients with advanced
STS and discusses ongoing efforts designed to improve patient outcomes through the use of novel therapeutic

INTRODUCTION
Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of solid tumors of mesenchymal origin that account for < 1% of
all adult and 15% of pediatric malignancies in the United States. These tumors can arise anywhere in the body, but develop predominantly in the limbs, limb girdle, and abdominal cavity.1 Overall, an estimated 10,520 new STS cases are
expected to be diagnosed in 2010 in the United States, and 3920 individuals will die of these tumors.2 The overall 5-year
survival rate for patients with STS is approximately 50% to 60% in adults and 75% in children, depending on tumor
grade, size, depth, site, and histological subtype.3-5
Surgical resection, with the goal of achieving an appropriately negative margin, is the primary modality of treatment
and is considered definitive for patients with localized low-grade tumors.6 Adjuvant radiation with or without chemotherapy is indicated for patients with high-grade STS [stage II-III; American Joint Committee on Cancer, Cancer Staging
Manual, Seventh Edition (2010)]. Alternatively, these modalities may be delivered preoperatively to reduce tumor size or
improve resectability, particularly in potentially resectable cases or when there are concerns for adverse functional outcomes after surgery.6 Patients with stage IV disease are characterized as having regional lymph node involvement or distant
metastases, regardless of tumor size or depth.1 Patients with advanced local disease or metastatic disease have a particularly
poor prognosis, with a median overall survival (OS) of only 8 to 12 months.7 However, outcome varies depending on
the histologic subtype (eg, metastatic disease may persist for  10 years in patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma
[ASPS]).7-10
The treatment of stage IV disease depends on the extent of metastases. The lung is the most common site of metastasis in patients with STS of the extremities, whereas extrapulmonary metastases usually develop as a later manifestation of
widely disseminated disease.9 Liver metastases are also frequently encountered in patients with STS in the abdominal cavity.9 Patients with limited metastases confined to a single organ or regional lymph node may be considered for resection

whenever possible and subsequently managed in the same
manner as those with high-grade disease.6,11 Patients with
disseminated metastases, however, should be considered
for palliative systemic therapy.11,12 This article provides
an overview of the current approach to systemic therapy
in patients with unresectable and metastatic STS (excluding gastrointestinal stromal tumors [GIST]), highlights
novel therapies, and introduces new treatment paradigms
that may offer the potential to improve outcomes.

Current Approach to the Treatment of
Patients With Advanced STS
Current guidelines from the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) and the European Society for
Medical Oncology (ESMO) consider single-agent or combination regimens as options for the first-line treatment of
patients with advanced unresectable STS.6,11 Chemotherapy may be continued until disease progression, although
clinical efficacy decreases over time and cumulative toxicity
may become problematic as additional cycles are administered (eg, higher cumulative doses of doxorubicin cause
cardiomyopathy and an associated mortality risk).13,14 The
guidelines also support a ‘‘watchful waiting’’ approach for
asymptomatic patients diagnosed with advanced disease,
especially those patients with long disease-free intervals and
minimal disease burden and patients who have achieved
best response with first-line chemotherapy.6,12 The lack of
evidence supporting the continuation of chemotherapy
until disease progression, the limitations of the watchful
waiting approach (including potential disease progression
and associated patient anxiety), and the poor OS of
patients with advanced STS underscore the need for new
therapies and treatment approaches.
In first-line chemotherapy, efforts were made to
improve the objective response rate (ORR), either by
increasing the dose intensity or administering active
agents in combination, with the goal of improving patient
survival.15 However, although some improvement was
achieved, it did not translate into a survival benefit. A
pooled analysis of 8 randomized clinical trials involving
2281 patients with STS demonstrated a slight trend favoring doxorubicin-based combination therapy for ORR
(odds ratio [OR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 0.60-1.05 [P ¼ .10]); these results, as well as OS data
(OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67-1.06 [P ¼ .13]), did not reach
statistical significance compared with single-agent doxorubicin.16 Nausea, vomiting, and myelosuppression were
consistently more severe with the combination regimens.

The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma
Group retrospectively evaluated factors important in predicting response and survival among 2185 patients with
advanced STS who received a first-line anthracycline-containing regimen.8 For the entire cohort, the ORR was
26% and the median OS was 51 weeks. Although the absence of liver metastases and younger age of the patients
were found to be independently associated with both
response and survival, high histopathological grade was
associated with response to chemotherapy, whereas low
histopathological grade was associated with survival, suggesting that the ORR may not be sufficient for determining the potential clinical benefit of new agents for the
treatment of STS.
Single-agent regimens

Single-agent chemotherapy with doxorubicin, ifosfamide, or dacarbazine and combination regimens with or
without an anthracycline backbone have been widely used
to treat patients with disseminated metastatic STS
(Table 1).15-29 Doxorubicin is the single most active agent
in the treatment of metastatic STS, producing ORRs of
16% to 27% in clinical trials.16,17 Although the response
to doxorubicin may depend on dose intensity, this needs to
be balanced against the greater toxicity associated with
higher doses (eg, cardiotoxicity).30
Epirubicin and the liposomal anthracyclines were
developed to improve the safety profile of doxorubicin.
Epirubicin tended to be slightly less efficacious than doxorubicin (ORR, 18% vs 25%; P ¼ .33), but produced less
hematological toxicity and less nausea and vomiting.18
Improved ORRs were reported with higher doses of epirubicin at the expense of greater toxicity.31 However, in a
cohort of 334 patients with advanced STS, 2 different
schedules of high-dose epirubicin failed to improve the
ORR or OS when compared with a standard dose of
doxorubicin (75 mg/m2), and any toxicity advantage was
lost.32 Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin appeared to be as
effective as standard-dose doxorubicin in a randomized
trial of patients with advanced STS (N ¼ 94).33 However,
in this study, both agents produced low ORRs (10% and
9%, respectively), but had differing toxicity profiles. In
other phase 2 trials, ORRs with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ranged from 0% to 10%, although approximately one-third of the patients achieved stable disease
(SD).15,34,35
Standard-dose ifosfamide is active in the first-line
treatment of patients with advanced STS (ORRs of 10%-

25%).19,36 High-dose ifosfamide (HDI) regimens produced ORRs as high as 38%, but were associated with
higher hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities than
the standard dose.19,20,37 The EORTC Soft Tissue and
Bone Sarcoma Group compared 2 investigational HDI
schedules versus standard-dose doxorubicin in a phase 3
trial of patients with advanced STS (N ¼ 326).21 No differences in ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), or OS
were observed, but myelosuppression occurred more frequently with HDI. Higher doses may be effective in
patients who develop disease progression or recurrence after doxorubicin pretreatment and/or first-line standarddose ifosfamide.38 In a phase 2 study of patients whose
disease had progressed after pretreatment, HDI produced
responses in 33% of patients and SD in 22%. It is interesting to note that 24% of patients with disease refractory to
standard-dose ifosfamide achieved partial responses (PR);
the median duration of response was 8 months and the
median OS was 12 months. However, HDI was associated with dose-limiting neutropenia, as well as neurotox-

1476

icity and renal toxicity. In a subsequent EORTC
multicenter phase 2 trial, HDI administered with
adequate mesna protection appeared to be somewhat less
effective.39
Dacarbazine has been available for more than 3 decades. In a pooled analysis of published and unpublished
data, the ORR of single-agent dacarbazine was 18%.40 In
a phase 2 trial of patients with metastatic STS (N ¼ 11),
temozolomide, an oral prodrug of dacarbazine, produced
an ORR of 8%.15 The ORR rate improved to 16% when
temozolomide was administered once daily for 6 weeks
followed by a 3-week break from treatment in a patient
population with pretreated STS.22
Combination chemotherapy regimens

Although combination regimens involving anthracyclines, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine were developed to
increase ORRs and improve patient outcomes, studies
with these regimens were largely unsuccessful at improving outcomes, often increasing the toxicity burden. The

Novel Treatment Approaches for Sarcomas/Riedel

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) conducted a phase 3 trial comparing the combination of ifosfamide and doxorubicin with single-agent doxorubicin in
patients with metastatic STS (N ¼ 178).23 Although the
combination produced a significantly higher ORR (34%
vs 20%; P ¼ .03), it was associated with greater myelosuppression and did not significantly prolong OS. This study
also included a third treatment arm with mitomycin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin, which produced a higher ORR
than doxorubicin without increasing myelotoxicity; again,
survival was not improved. In an EORTC phase 3 trial,
the combination of ifosfamide and doxorubicin did not
significantly improve the ORR (28% vs 23%), median
response duration (44 weeks vs 46 weeks), or median OS
(55 weeks vs 52 weeks) compared with single-agent
doxorubicin, but did increase hematologic toxicity.24
EORTC-62012 is an ongoing phase 3 trial comparing the
combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide (with pegfilgrastim support) versus doxorubicin alone.
The combination of doxorubicin and dacarbazine
has a response rate that is comparable to or better than single-agent doxorubicin (Table 1).16,17,21,25 An intensified
regimen comprised of mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide,
and dacarbazine (MAID) significantly increased the ORR
(32% vs 17%; P < .005) and prolonged time to disease
progression (TTP) (6 months vs 4 months; P < .02) compared with the combination of doxorubicin and dacarbazine in a phase 3 trial.25 However, MAID did not
improve OS and was associated with greater
myelosuppression.
Several other drugs, including gemcitabine, docetaxel, and vinorelbine, have been evaluated in combination regimens in phase 2 trials, largely involving patients
with disease that is resistant to front-line chemotherapy.
Compared with gemcitabine alone, the gemcitabine and
docetaxel combination produced a higher ORR (16% vs
8%) and longer median OS (17.9 months vs 11.5
months; P ¼ .03), albeit with greater toxicity, in patients
with metastatic STS (N ¼ 122).26 However, a phase 2,
retrospective, pooled analysis of patients with leiomyosarcoma (N ¼ 121) who were treated with the combination
of gemcitabine and docetaxel in the second-line (n ¼ 84)
setting demonstrated no significant improvement in the
ORR or median PFS relative to single-agent gemcitabine.41 A gemcitabine and vinorelbine combination produced clinical benefit (25%) in a single-arm study and
was associated with a 12-month OS rate of 75%.27
Several studies have explored dose-escalated doxorubicin and ifosfamide combination regimens with colony-

stimulating factor (CSF) support. The EORTC compared
standard and intensified doses of doxorubicin in combination with ifosfamide in a phase 3 trial of patients with
advanced STS (N ¼ 314).28 Granulocyte-macrophageCSF (GMCSF) was administered to patients receiving the intensified dose. The intensified regimen
significantly prolonged the median TTP compared with
the standard-dose regimen (29 weeks vs 19 weeks), but
did not improve OS. Similarly, an intensified MAID regimen with granulocyte (G-CSF) support, in which the
doses of doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine were
20% to 33% higher than those in the standard MAID regimen, failed to improve the ORR, PFS, or OS in a recent
phase 3 trial.42 High-dose chemotherapy followed by
peripheral blood stem cell transplantation did not
improve the outcomes of patients who responded to firstline MAID.43 Because these regimens do not significantly
improve patient outcomes, better treatment options are
still needed.
Treatment Considerations for Certain
Sarcoma Subtypes
For many clinical trials evaluating chemotherapeutic
agents, patients with advanced STS have been grouped
together, regardless of tumor histology. However, growing evidence suggests that for patients with certain histological subtypes, specific agents besides doxorubicin may
be preferred options.
Angiosarcoma

Current NCCN guidelines recommend paclitaxel
and bevacizumab as treatment options for patients with
angiosarcoma, a rare STS subtype with an aggressive clinical course.6 In a phase 2 trial (N ¼ 26), bevacizumab produced a 12% PR rate in patients with angiosarcoma and
epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.44 Paclitaxel has
exhibited low activity in nonselected sarcoma populations, but favorable responses in patients with angiosarcomas of the scalp.45,46 Paclitaxel is highly active in
angiosarcomas, with an ORR of 62% and a median TTP
of 7.6 months.47 In a phase 2 trial examining patients
with advanced angiosarcomas (N ¼ 27), paclitaxel demonstrated a 19% PR rate after 2 cycles, a median TTP of 4
months, and a median OS of 8 months, but no difference
in PFS was noted between chemotherapy-treated and
chemotherapy-naive patients.48
Other nonapproved treatment options for angiosarcomas include multikinase inhibitors (eg, sorafenib and
sunitinib) and liposomal doxorubicin. In phase 2 trials,

1477

Review Article

sorafenib produced a 14% PR rate and a median OS of
14.3 months in an angiosarcoma trial (N ¼ 37),49 whereas
sunitinib did not produce a response rate in patients with
angiosarcoma (n ¼ 2) or fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma (n ¼ 3).50 In another phase 2 trial, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin demonstrated similar efficacy and reduced
myelosuppression compared with doxorubicin in patients
with advanced STS.33 Other results suggest that liposomal
doxorubicin might be considered as a palliative therapy in
patients with cutaneous angiosarcoma.51
Leiomyosarcoma

Leiomyosarcomas are generally believed to be insensitive to conventional chemotherapy. A phase 2 trial has
shown that the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel
has some activity in leiomyosarcomas.52 Patients with
unresectable leiomyosarcomas (N ¼ 34), mostly of the
uterine type, received the combination of gemcitabine
and docetaxel; 16 of the patients were treated after developing disease progression while receiving doxorubicinbased therapy. This regimen produced a 53% response
rate and a median TTP of 5.6 months. The same regimen
was evaluated as second-line treatment for patients with
advanced uterine leiomyosarcomas; the ORR (27%) was
lower than in the first trial, but an additional 50% of the
patients had SD for a median of 5.4 months and the 24week PFS rate was 52%.53 Although a recent pooled analysis suggests the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel has only limited benefit over gemcitabine alone,41
other reports have demonstrated the activity of the gemcitabine and docetaxel combination in leiomyosarcomas
and also suggest that this regimen is active in other sarcoma subtypes.26,54
Synovial sarcoma

In synovial sarcomas, both the size and location of
the primary tumor are independent factors that govern
disease-free survival after surgical resection of localized
disease.55,56 For adults with high-risk synovial sarcomas,
neoadjuvant/adjuvant ifosfamide-based therapy has been
associated with improved disease-specific survival.55 In a
phase 3 ECOG trial, the combination of ifosfamide and
doxorubicin produced a significantly higher ORR compared with single-agent doxorubicin (88% vs 20%; P ¼
.02) in a small subgroup of patients with advanced synovial sarcoma (N ¼ 20),23 whereas a PR rate of 42% and a
median OS of 11 months were observed in a follow-up
study.57 In a retrospective analysis of patients with
advanced STS (N ¼ 1337) who received first-line ifosfa-

1478

mide-based therapy, synovial sarcoma histology was identified as an independent, favorable prognostic factor for
both treatment response and OS.58
The DNA-binding cytotoxic agent trabectedin (ecteinascidin-743) and the multikinase inhibitor pazopanib
may also have antitumor activity in synovial sarcoma. In a
retrospective analysis of patients (N ¼ 39) with advanced/
metastatic disease who were treated with trabectedin, 18%
achieved a PR, 5% had minor responses, and 28% experienced SD.59 In a phase 2 study of pazopanib in patients
(N ¼ 37) with recurrent/refractory advanced STS, 13% of
patients with synovial sarcoma experienced a PR, with 49%
remaining free of disease progression at 12 weeks.60

Novel Therapeutics
Cytotoxic agents

Trabectedin is approved in Europe and 25 other
countries (excluding the United States) for the treatment
of patients with advanced STS after failure of an anthracycline and ifosfamide and in patients who are not suitable
candidates for these agents.6,61-63 In an EORTC phase 2
trial of 99 patients, a PR rate of 8% and an SD rate of
26% (of > 6 months) were observed in patients treated
with trabectedin who failed previous chemotherapy regimens.64 The median PFS was 105 days and the median
OS was 9.2 months. Trabectedin was generally well tolerated, with neutropenia and asymptomatic transaminase
elevations reported to be the main toxicities. Comparable
results were reported in other phase 2 trials involving
more heavily pretreated patients.65,66 Trabectedin has
also shown promising activity in a retrospective analysis of
pretreated patients (N ¼ 51) with advanced myxoid liposarcomas (ORR of 51% and a median PFS of 14
months).67 Currently, trabectedin is being evaluated
against dacarbazine in a randomized, multicenter, phase 3
trial in patients with advanced pretreated L-sarcoma (liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma).68
TH-302, a hypoxia-activated cytotoxic prodrug,
was administered in combination with doxorubicin and
produced a 25% PR rate in a phase 1/2 trial of patients
with advanced or metastatic STS (N ¼ 20).69 Palifosfamide, the active moiety of the chemotherapy prodrug ifosfamide, in combination with doxorubicin, was found to
double the PFS over doxorubicin alone (7.8 months vs
4.4 months) in a phase 2 trial of patients with unresectable
or metastatic STS.70 An ongoing phase 3 trial is examining this combination as a front-line treatment for patients
with STS.71

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors

To our knowledge, no tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) have been approved to date for the treatment of sarcoma other than GIST. Pazopanib, which targets vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and plateletderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), has shown
promising activity in patients with advanced STS.60 Compared with historical controls receiving second-line chemotherapy, pazopanib prolonged PFS and OS in patients with
STS (including leiomyosarcomas and synovial sarcomas).
Pazopanib was generally well tolerated; the most common
grade 3/4 toxicities were hypertension, fatigue, and hyperbilirubinemia. Based on these findings, the EORTC initiated the Pazopanib Explored in Soft Tissue Sarcoma a
Phase 3 (PALETTE) trial to compare pazopanib with placebo in patients (N ¼ 369) whose disease had progressed
during or after at least 1 anthracycline-containing regimen.
Preliminary results have indicated that although treatment
with pazopanib did not improve OS, the median PFS was
significantly prolonged by 13 weeks.72
Other multikinase inhibitors have been tested in
patients with advanced STS, generally with limited success reported to date. In a phase 2 trial (N ¼ 48), sunitinib
produced a PR in a patient with a desmoplastic round cell
tumor and SD lasting  16 weeks in 10 additional
patients, including 2 of 3 patients with solitary fibrous
tumors. Patients who underwent positron emission
tomography/computed tomography scanning (n ¼ 21)
demonstrated evidence of a metabolic PR or SD.50 Sorafenib has exhibited single-agent activity against angiosarcomas, but showed minimal activity against other
histological subtypes.49 Skin toxicity was the dose-limiting side effect. Sorafenib has also demonstrated activity in
desmoid tumors, which are fibroblastic neoplasms that
arise from musculoaponeurotic stromal elements.73 Imatinib, a KIT/PDGFR/BCR-ABL TKI that is used as firstline therapy for patients with unresectable/metastatic
GIST, was evaluated in 10 histological sarcoma subtypes,
producing responses in 4 of 185 patients (2%).74 When
SD (> 4 months) was included, the clinical benefit rate
(CBR) was 15% overall, with the highest CBR noted in
patients with liposarcomas and leiomyosarcomas.
ARQ 197, a selective inhibitor of the c-Met receptor
tyrosine kinase, is indicated for a rare group of tumors associated with the microphthalmia transcription factor family,
including clear cell sarcoma (CCS) and ASPS.75,76 In a
phase 2 trial of patients with CCS (n ¼ 7), ASPS (n ¼ 17),
and translocation-associated renal cell carcinoma, treatment
with ARQ 197 demonstrated a 14% PR rate in patients

with CCS and a SD rate of 29% and 59%, respectively, in
patients with CCS and ASPS. Treatment with the fibroblast
growth factor receptor and VEGFR inhibitor brivanib in
patients with advanced STS has been shown to prolong PFS
(from week 12) in comparison with placebo (2.8 months vs
1.4 months) in basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2)-positive patients.77 Cediranib, another VEGFR inhibitor, has
also demonstrated promising preliminary results; in 1 study
(N ¼ 7), 4 PRs and 1 case of SD78 were observed and in
another study (N ¼ 36), a 43% PR rate was noted in evaluable patients (n ¼ 28).79 Axitinib, a small-molecule TKI
with multiple targets, is currently being investigated in
patients with advanced/metastatic STS.80
Insulin-like growth factor 1 inhibitors

Several antiinsulin-like growth factor 1 monoclonal
antibodies are being investigated in patients with advanced
sarcoma, including figitumumab and cixutumumab
(IMC-A12). Figitumumab has been evaluated in a phase 1
study in patients with sarcoma and Ewing sarcoma; among
patients with STS (N ¼ 9), an SD rate of 56% and a 44%
progressive disease rate were observed.81 Figitumumab has
also been investigated in combination with everolimus in a
phase 1 study of patients with advanced sarcoma and other
advanced tumors (N ¼ 21); of 18 evaluable patients, 1
achieved a PR and 83% experienced SD.82 In a phase 2 trial
(N ¼ 113), initial results with single-agent cixutumumab
demonstrated the highest CBR (57%) in patients with adipocytic sarcoma (n ¼ 37).83 Currently, cixutumumab is
being investigated in combination with temsirolimus in
patients with metastatic sarcomas.84
Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors

The rationale for mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitors in patients with advanced STS has
been reviewed.85,86 In a case study, treatment with sirolimus (rapamycin, the prototype mTOR inhibitor) and
cyclophosphamide produced a PR in a patient with metastatic myxoid chondrosarcoma, a slow-growing sarcoma
that responds poorly to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.87 Treatment with sirolimus in patients (n ¼ 3) with
perivascular epithelioid cell tumors also resulted in radiographic responses as well as molecular tuberous sclerosis
complex (TSC) and mTOR complex changes.88 In a
phase 2 trial, treatment with everolimus in patients (N ¼
61) with recurrent or refractory sarcoma produced a complete response (CR), PR, or SD (after 4 months) in 13%
of patients with STS or bone sarcoma and 27% of patients
with GIST.89 Common adverse events (AEs) included

mucositis, fatigue, and elevation of liver transaminases. In
combination with imatinib, everolimus has demonstrated
activity in a phase 1/2 study of imatinib-resistant GIST.90
Everolimus also reduces tumor volume by regulating gene
products of the TSC in subependymal giant cell astrocytomas.91 Temsirolimus was investigated in a phase 2 trial of
patients (N ¼ 40) with advanced sarcoma, but only 5% of
evaluable patients (those with undifferentiated fibrosarcoma and uterine leiomyosarcoma) achieved a PR.92 Tolerability was poor, with 43% of evaluable patients
experiencing an AE of grade 3 or higher possibly related
to the drug. Ridaforolimus has demonstrated antitumor
activity in 2 phase 1 trials that included patients with
advanced STS.93,94 In a subsequent phase 2 trial of
patients (N ¼ 212) with advanced STS or bone sarcomas,
the majority of whom were previously treated, treatment
with ridaforolimus resulted in a 29% CBR and a median
OS of 40 weeks.95 The most common AEs were fatigue,
stomatitis, hypertriglyceridemia, anemia, rash, and nausea. In a phase 1 trial, an oral formulation of ridaforolimus
produced a 23% CBR in the subgroup of patients with
advanced sarcomas.96
Other agents

In phase 1 and 2 trials, the Akt inhibitor perifosine
has been evaluated in patients with advanced STS. One
study failed to meet the primary objective of a 40% PFS
rate at 6 months,97 whereas in another study, no objective
responses were observed and 27% of patients experienced
SD.98 In contrast, a retrospective analysis (N ¼ 60) demonstrated a 5% PR rate in evaluable patients (45% of

1480

patients with SD for  4 months),99 suggesting that perifosine may not be particularly effective in producing
tumor responses but may have some role in disease stabilization. The mitotic inhibitor eribulin was examined in an
EORTC phase 2 trial of patients with STS stratified by
subtype and met prespecified statistical boundaries for the
primary endpoint of PFS at 12 weeks for both leiomyosarcoma and adipocytic sarcoma.100 Eribulin is currently
being evaluated in a phase 3 clinical trial for patients with
advanced, refractory STS.101 ABT-510, a peptide that
mimics the antiangiogenic activity of thrombospondin-1,
was tested in a phase 2 trial in patients (N ¼ 88) with
locally advanced or metastatic STS. Approximately 50%
of patients achieved SD, and only 1 objective response
occurred.102 Rexin-G (Epeius Biotechnologies, San Marino, Calif), a gene therapy vector bearing a cytocidal dominant negative cyclin D1 construct, was investigated in a
phase 1/2 study of patients with STS and bone sarcomas
(N ¼ 20); 65% of patients achieved SD according to
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
criteria.103 Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have
also shown some promise in treating sarcoma. A phase 1/2
trial of patients with metastatic sarcoma is currently examining the safety and tolerability of the HDAC inhibitor
valproic acid in combination with bevacizumab, gemcitabine, and docetaxel.104

safety profile was considered to be similar to that of other
mTOR inhibitors. Further studies will help confirm the
benefit of maintenance therapy with mTOR inhibitors in
patients with advanced STS.

disease progression in responsive patients or patients with
SD after a defined number of chemotherapy cycles
(Fig. 1). Given the inherent toxicity associated with firstline chemotherapy and the need to continue maintenance
therapy for prolonged periods of time, agents used in
maintenance therapy should be well tolerated. Some chemotherapeutic agents, as well as targeted therapies with
cytostatic properties and documented tolerability, have
been found to be effective as maintenance therapy in
patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer.105-107 However, some studies have not demonstrated
a benefit of maintenance therapy.108
The Sarcoma Multi-center Clinical Evaluation of
the Efficacy of Ridaforolimus (SUCCEED) trial, one of
the largest studies of patients with metastatic STS or bone
sarcoma published to date, is a pivotal phase 3 trial that
evaluated maintenance therapy with oral ridaforolimus in
patients (N ¼ 711) who achieved a favorable response
(CR, PR, or SD) after receiving a minimum of 4 cycles of
chemotherapy (Fig. 2). Preliminary data have demonstrated a significant increase in PFS (ridaforolimus vs placebo), with a 21% improvement in the median PFS (17.7
weeks vs 14.6 weeks; hazard ratio [HR], 0.72 [P ¼
.0001]) and a nonstatistically significant trend toward an
OS benefit (21.4 months vs 19.2 months; HR, 0.88 [P ¼
.2256]).109 The incidence of stomatitis and other AEs was
higher in patients receiving ridaforolimus, and the overall

Conclusions
The current standard of care for patients with unresectable
advanced STS includes first-line treatment with singleagent doxorubicin or a doxorubicin-based combination
chemotherapy regimen. However, patients in this setting
have a poor prognosis. Efforts to increase ORRs through
the use of combination or dose-intense regimens have had
little impact on patient outcome. Several recent advances
offer promise for the treatment of patients with advanced
STS. First, increasing evidence suggests that patients with
certain STS histologies may benefit from specific treatments, such as paclitaxel or sorafenib in those with angiosarcomas and ifosfamide in patients with synovial
sarcomas. Second, several targeted drugs have demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with advanced STS, and
ongoing efforts are exploring how to best deploy such
agents in conjunction with existing treatment options.
Finally, drawing on clinical experience in treating other
malignancies, maintenance therapy is being evaluated as a
new treatment paradigm for patients with advanced disease. These data suggest that the future is bright for
improving treatment options and outcomes for patients
with advanced STS.
