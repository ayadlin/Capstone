Abstract
Activation of de novo lipogenesis in cancer cells is increasingly recognized as a hallmark of aggressive
cancers and has been implicated in the production of membranes for rapid cell proliferation. In the current
report, we provide evidence that this activation has a more profound role. Using a mass spectrometry–based
phospholipid analysis approach, we show that clinical tumor tissues that display the lipogenic phenotype
show an increase in the degree of lipid saturation compared with nonlipogenic tumors. Reversal of the lipogenic switch in cancer cells by treatment with the lipogenesis inhibitor soraphen A or by targeting lipogenic
enzymes with small interfering RNA leads to a marked decrease in saturated and mono-unsaturated phospholipid species and increases the relative degree of polyunsaturation. Because polyunsaturated acyl chains are
more susceptible to peroxidation, inhibition of lipogenesis increases the levels of peroxidation end products
and renders cells more susceptible to oxidative stress–induced cell death. As saturated lipids pack more
densely, modulation of lipogenesis also alters lateral and transversal membrane dynamics as revealed by
diffusion of membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein and by the uptake and response to doxorubicin.
These data show that shifting lipid acquisition from lipid uptake toward de novo lipogenesis dramatically
changes membrane properties and protects cells from both endogenous and exogenous insults. These findings
provide important new insights into the role of de novo lipogenesis in cancer cells, and they provide a rationale
for the use of lipogenesis inhibitors as antineoplastic agents and as chemotherapeutic sensitizers. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Development and progression of cancer are frequently
associated with increased de novo production of fatty acids
in tumor cells. Activation of de novo lipogenesis correlates
with a poorer prognosis and shorter disease-free survival
for many tumor types (1–4). This metabolic change occurs

as a result of common oncogenic insults and is mediated by
the activation of multiple lipogenic enzymes. These enzymes
are affected at all levels of regulation including transcription,
translation, protein stabilization, and protein phosphorylation. Increased lipid production has been linked to an increased need for membranes during rapid cell proliferation,
and is considered to be part of a more general metabolic
transformation that provides cancer cells with more autonomy in terms of their supply of building blocks for growth
(5). In support of this hypothesis, blockade of lipogenesis by
chemical inhibitors or RNA interference (RNAi)–mediated silencing of lipogenic enzymes or their regulators attenuates
cell proliferation and ultimately leads to cell death (6–16).
In several cancer types, overexpression of lipogenic enzymes
is observed very early in cancer development and is independent of the proliferative status of the individual cells (17, 18).
This suggests that the role of tumor-associated lipogenesis
may extend beyond bulk membrane biosynthesis to meet
the needs of rapid cell proliferation. Activation of growth
factor signaling and protection from cell death are just a
few of the emerging novel roles of this pathway (19–22).
In this study, we investigated the most direct effects of
lipogenesis, specifically the changes in the lipid composition

of cancer cells, and assessed the consequences of these
alterations on cancer cell biology. Our findings suggest that
tumor-associated lipogenesis protects cancer cells from
carcinogenic- and therapeutic-associated insults by promoting membrane lipid saturation. They also provide a
rationale for the use of lipogenesis inhibitors as chemotherapeutic sensitizers.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatments
LNCaP, 22Rv1, PC-3, Du145, BT474, and HCT116 cells
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(between 2008 and 2010) and authenticated by checking
morphology and by karyotyping in December 2009. Cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640, DMEM/F-12, or McCoy's 5A medium
supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen). Palmitic, linoleic,
and linolenic acid (Sigma) were complexed to fatty acid–free
bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen) as described (8). Soraphen
A was kindly provided by Drs. Klaus Gerth and Rolf Jansen
(Helmholtz-Zentrum für Infektionsforschung, Braunschweig,
Germany; refs. 23, 24). Doxorubicin and verapamil were obtained from Sigma. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting
fatty acid synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α
(ACC) were obtained from Ambion. Multiple siRNA sets were
tested. Those with the least off-target effects as judged by
microarray analysis (data not shown) were selected for subsequent experiments (s883 and s5030). Silencer Select Negative
Control #1 siRNA from Ambion was used as control. Cells
were reverse transfected with siRNAs (50 nmol/L) using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen).
Clinical tissue specimens
Fresh, snap-frozen prostate cancer tissues and matching
normal samples were obtained from patients who had undergone a radical retropubic prostatectomy for localized prostatic carcinoma. Harvesting of the tissue samples was
performed as previously described (25). The normal and tumor tissues were identified by histologic analysis of areas adjacent to the tissue that was used for lipid and Western
blotting analysis. The use of clinical samples was approved
by the Local Commission for Medical Ethics and Clinical
Studies at the University of Liège.
[2-14C]acetate incorporation assay and TLC analysis
2-14C–labeled acetate (57 mCi/mmol; 2 μCi/dish; Amersham International) was added to the culture medium.
Lipids were extracted according to a modified Bligh-Dyer
method and analyzed by TLC analysis as described (9).
Quantification of total cellular phospholipids,
triglycerides, and cholesterol
Phospholipids, triglycerides, and cholesterol were quantitated as described (26–28).
Gas chromatographic analysis of fatty acyl chains
Aliquots of Bligh-Dyer lipid extracts (9) were supplemented with tricosanoic acid as internal standard, subjected to

acidic methanolysis, and analyzed by gas chromatography–
mass spectrometry (Trace GC-MS, Thermo Finnigan) using
a Supercap 5HT column (15 m × 0.25 mm; 0.10 μm; Alltech).
Total ion current signals, obtained in EI+ mode, were related
to the internal standard signal and converted to nmol fatty
acid using experimentally obtained relative response factors.
Analysis of intact phospholipid species by electrospray
ionization tandem mass spectrometry
Tissue or cells were homogenized in 1 N HCl/CH3OH (1:8,
v/v). CHCl3, 200 μg/mL of the antioxidant 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4methylphenol (Sigma; ref. 29), and lipid standards were
added. The organic fractions were evaporated and reconstituted in CH3OH/CHCl3/NH4OH (90:10:1.25, v/v/v). Phospholipids were analyzed by electrospray ionization tandem mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) on a hybrid quadrupole linear
ion trap mass spectrometer (4000 QTRAP system, Applied
Biosystems) equipped with a robotic nanoflow/ion source
(Advion Biosciences). The collision energy was varied as follows: prec 184, 50 eV; nl 141, 35 eV; nl 87, −40 eV; prec 241,
−55 eV. The system was operated in the multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) mode for quantification of individual
species. Typically, a 3-minute period of signal averaging
was used for each spectrum. Data were corrected for 13C isotope effects if the contribution was >10%. Corrected data
were presented as heat maps using the HeatMap Builder
software (Clifton Watt, Stanford University).
Lipid peroxidation product assay
Equal amounts of cells were scraped in ice-cold PBS. After
sonication, 3,000 × g supernatants were analyzed using a
commercial lipid peroxidation assay kit (Oxford Biomedical
Research).
Immunoblotting analysis
Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto precast gels
(NuPAGE, Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with antibodies against FASN (30),
ACC (Cell Signaling Technology), α-tubulin (Cell Signaling
Technology), and β-actin (Sigma) as described (8, 9). The
ImageMaster 1D software (GE Healthcare) was used for
densitometric quantification.
Determination of lateral membrane dynamics by
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and
fluorescence diffusion after photoactivation
Cells, grown on Lab-Tek II chambered cover glass (Nunc),
were transfected with pAcGFP1-F (Clontech) for FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) or with PA-GFP-F (farnesylated photoactivatable form of GFP; ref. 31) for fluorescence
diffusion on photoactivation using an Olympus FluoView
FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus America, Inc.) and a
Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal system, respectively (31–33).
A 405-nm laser diode was used for bleaching (10 seconds at
50 mW) and activation. Full-frame images (512 × 512 pixels)
were recorded using a 488-nm argon laser and a 500- to 600-nm
band-pass emission filter. Changes in fluorescence were
calculated using the FluoView FV1000 software (Olympus).

Lipogenesis Promotes Membrane Lipid Saturation

Determination of flip-flop rate and doxorubicin
accumulation
To measure the flip-flop rate of doxorubicin, cells were
treated with 10 μmol/L 7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE; Invitrogen), exposed to
doxorubicin, and monitored in a fluorimeter (excitation,
450 nm; emission, 510 nm) at 37°C. The difference between
the NBD fluorescence 2 seconds after the addition of doxorubicin and the NBD fluorescence 4 minutes later was used
as the measurement for the relative flip-flop rate of doxorubicin (34). To measure doxorubicin accumulation, the cells
were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (515-nm
long-pass emission filter) 30 minutes after addition of doxorubicin (10 μmol/L) or fluorimetrically (excitation, 490 nm;
emission, 580 nm).
Cell death assay
At the indicated time after compound exposure, the adherent and floating cells were collected and combined. The viable and dead cells were counted using the trypan blue dye
exclusion assay (9). Synergism was determined using the
combination index (CI) method (35).
Statistical analysis
The results were analyzed by a Student's t test or by oneway ANOVA using a Tukey multiple comparison test. P
values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
All data presented represent means ± SE, as indicated in the
figure legends.

Results and Discussion
Reversal of the lipogenic phenotype depletes cancer
cells of saturated and mono-unsaturated acyl chains
and causes a shift toward polyunsaturation
To study the effect of tumor-associated lipogenesis on cellular lipid composition, we treated LNCaP prostate cancer
cells, which have a high lipogenic activity, with soraphen A
(further referred to as soraphen). Soraphen is a highly potent
inhibitor of ACC (23, 24, 36) and is an ideal tool to reverse
the lipogenic phenotype in cancer cells (12). Consistent with
previous studies (12), soraphen treatment decreased the
incorporation of 14C- from 2-14C–labeled acetate into phospholipids and triglycerides by 7- and 13-fold, respectively
(Fig. 1A) and led to a 1.7- and 4.2-fold reduction of the total
phospholipid and triglyceride levels, respectively (Fig. 1B).
Cholesterol levels remained unaffected.
Because mammalian cells have a limited ability to synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acids de novo, as they lack the Δ12
desaturase required to produce fatty acids of the ω3 and ω6
series, we hypothesized that de novo lipogenesis would enrich
cancer cells mainly with saturated and/or mono-unsaturated
acyl chains and that reversal of the lipogenic phenotype
would cause a selective reduction in the levels of these latter
acyl species. To test this hypothesis, the total cellular lipid
extracts were methanolysed, and the generated fatty acyl
methyl esters were analyzed by gas chromatography. Soraphen treatment decreased the total levels of palmitoyl

www.aacrjournals.org

(16:0), stearoyl (18:0), and oleoyl (18:1) species by ∼2-fold.
The levels of polyunsaturated acyl chain species, the precursors of which were obligatorily derived from the medium
(containing 10% serum), substantially increased (Fig. 1C).
The net result was (a) an overall decrease in cellular acyl
content, confirming the importance of de novo lipogenesis
for quantitative lipid supply, and (b) a major shift in cellular
acyl chain composition toward polyunsaturation; the relative
cellular contribution of saturated acyl chains dropped from
38% to 29% and polyunsaturated fatty acids increased from
9% to 20%.
Based on our observation that most of the labeled acyl
chains were incorporated into phospholipids in cancer cells
(Fig. 1A) and given the importance of phospholipid acyl
chain composition in numerous membrane-related functions, we further investigated the effects of soraphen treatment on intact phospholipids by ESI-MS/MS. As shown in
Fig. 1D, soraphen treatment substantially decreased phosphatidylcholine (PC) species with zero or one degree of unsaturation (both acyl chains combined) up to 4-fold, whereas
species with polyunsaturated chains (more than three unsaturations in both chains combined) increased up to 8-fold,
depending on the species. A similar trend toward decreased
saturation and increased polyunsaturation was also observed
for phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine (Supplementary Fig. S1); however, these effects were less pronounced and less general compared with those of PC.
The observed changes in membrane lipid saturation were
not unique to LNCaP cells. Similar effects were observed in
all lipogenic cancer cell lines tested. These included three
other prostate cancer cell lines (22Rv1, PC-3, and Du145), a
breast cancer cell line (BT474), and a colorectal cancer cell
line (HCT116; Fig. 1D). Changes were most outspoken in
LNCaP and in HCT116 cells. Importantly, a similar shift in
membrane lipid saturation was seen after siRNA-mediated
knockdown of the lipogenic enzymes FASN or ACC (siRNA)
instead of treatment with soraphen (Fig. 1E). Effects were
somewhat less pronounced than after soraphen treatment,
reflecting the less potent inhibition of lipogenesis [2- to
3-fold reduction in the incorporation of 14C- from 2-14C–
labeled acetate into lipids (Supplementary Fig. S2) versus
an 8-fold reduction after soraphen treatment]. Overall, these
data strongly support the hypothesis that the lipogenic
phenotype in cancer cells provides cells with saturated and
mono-unsaturated acyl chains, which replenishes the cells
with membrane components and simultaneously increases
the relative degree of saturation of phospholipids, particularly that of PC.
Activation of the lipogenic pathway is associated with
increased saturation of phospholipids in vivo in
human tumor specimens
To assess whether the lipogenic phenotype of cancer cells
is associated with an increased saturation of phospholipids
in vivo, prostate tumor specimens and normal matching control tissues were analyzed for overexpression of FASN by
Western blot analysis, and the phospholipid profiles were recorded. Three of the five matched samples (tumor versus

tumor-associated lipogenesis increases the saturation of
phospholipids in human tumors.
Modulation of de novo fatty acid synthesis in cancer
cells affects the susceptibility of cellular membranes to
lipid peroxidation
Saturated, mono-unsaturated, and polyunsaturated acyl
chains dramatically differ in terms of their structural and
physicochemical properties. One of the key differences is
their susceptibility to peroxidation. In this process, free radicals extract electrons from lipids in cellular membranes,
which leads to the formation of oxidized lipid species. These

lipid species have important biological functions and may ultimately degrade into smaller reactive products including
malondialdehydes and 4-hydroxyalkenals, which can cause
cell damage when expressed at high levels (37–39). As the
hydrogens in between double bonds in methylene (CH2)
groups are particularly reactive, polyunsaturated acyl chains
are much more susceptible to peroxidation. Consistent with
our observation that modulation of de novo fatty acid synthesis in cancer cells affects the balance between (mono-un)
saturated and polyunsaturated acyl chains in the phospholipids of cellular membranes, soraphen treatment significantly
increased the levels of lipid peroxidation products (Fig. 3A).

of free radicals, induced a further increase in peroxidation
products. Interestingly, partial replenishment of saturated
acyl chains by supplementation of the medium with exogenous palmitic acid (Fig. 3B) largely reversed these changes,
supporting the idea that enhanced lipogenesis renders cancer cells less susceptible to lipid peroxidation by limiting
the degree of phospholipid polyunsaturation.
De novo lipogenesis determines the sensitivity of cancer
cells to oxidative stress–induced cell death
There is growing evidence that oxidized phospholipids and
their degradation products play a key role in the induction
and mediation of cellular apoptosis (40–43). Therefore, we investigated whether modulation of de novo lipogenesis affected the sensitivity of cancer cells to oxidative stress–induced
cell death. The native LNCaP cells were fairly resistant to
H2O2-induced cell death, but pretreatment with soraphen
markedly increased their death in response to H2O2, as shown
by trypan blue staining (Fig. 4A). These effects were counteracted by exogenous palmitic acid. Interestingly, when the me-

dium was supplemented with a mixture of saturated and
polyunsaturated fatty acids, the rescue effect was much less
pronounced. These data indicate that the increased sensitivity to oxidative stress observed after soraphen treatment is
not due to the general decrease in the amount of lipids but
rather to the change in lipid (un)saturation. Concordant results were obtained in 22Rv1 cells (Fig. 4A) and in PC-3,
BT474, and HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Similarly,
siRNA-mediated knockdown of the lipogenic pathway increased the sensitivity to oxidative stress–induced cell death,
as illustrated for LNCaP and HCT116 cells (Fig. 4B). Overall,
these data support the idea that increased lipogenesis protects cancer cells from oxidative stress–induced cell death
by changing the extent of saturation of cellular membranes.
Tumor-associated fatty acid synthesis alters membrane
dynamics and affects the uptake and response to
common chemotherapeutics
In addition to its effect on lipid peroxidation, modulation
of membrane lipid composition is known to have a major effect

cell viability. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SE. *, P < 0.05, significantly different from control/siCtrl; #, P < 0.05, significantly different from both treatment with

on the mobility of membrane components (38, 44). To examine whether modulation of de novo fatty acid synthesis in
cancer cells exerts similar effects, we investigated the effect
of soraphen on both the lateral and transversal mobility of
membrane components in LNCaP cells. Lateral mobility refers to the movement of membrane components within the
plane of one membrane leaflet, whereas transversal mobility
refers to movement from one leaflet to the other. To analyze
lateral membrane mobility, we followed the movement of
membrane-targeted GFP using two complementary techniques: FRAP and fluorescence diffusion after photoactivation.
To perform FRAP, we transiently transfected LNCaP cells
with the plasmid pAcGFP1-F that encodes GFP with a farnesylation tag. We bleached the fluorescence in a small area
and measured the recovery of fluorescence in this area, which
is mediated by neighboring GFP molecules moving into the
bleached area. As shown in Fig. 5A, soraphen-treated cells
had a faster fluorescence recovery rate compared with
control cells. Similar results were obtained with BT474 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4). In the complementary experiment,
LNCaP cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding a

www.aacrjournals.org

farnesylated photoactivatable form of GFP (PA-GFP-F). At a
fixed time point after photoactivation of GFP in a small spot
of the plasma membrane, the fluorescence intensity was measured as a function of the distance from the spot of photoactivation. The slope of the curve for the soraphen-treated cells
was less steep than that for the control cells, reflecting a higher diffusion rate (Fig. 5B). Together with the FRAP data, these
results indicate that inhibition of fatty acid synthesis increases the lateral mobility of membrane components.
Transversal mobility of membrane components, also referred to as flip-flop, occurs at a low rate unless it is facilitated
by specific transporters. However, for certain exogenous compounds including commonly used chemotherapeutics, such
as doxorubicin, passive flip-flop is a major mechanism of entry into the cells (34). Because treatment of cells with exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids is known to promote the
uptake of doxorubicin (45), we determined whether inhibition
of fatty acid synthesis would promote membrane flip-flop and
doxorubicin uptake. The flip-flop of doxorubicin was assessed
by monitoring doxorubicin-mediated quenching of NBD-PE, a
fluorescently labeled phospholipid that incorporates into

which is caused by the association of doxorubicin with phospholipids in the outer leaflet. As doxorubicin translocates to
the inner leaflet, further quenching of NBD is observed (34).

Monitoring of NBD quenching indicated that soraphen induced a 6-fold increase in the flip-flop rate of doxorubicin
(Fig. 6A). These effects were not caused by indirect effects
of P-glycoprotein, which pumps hydrophobic molecules such
as doxorubicin out of the cell, because similar results were

Figure 6. Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis in cancer cells affects the uptake and cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. A, effect of soraphen on the flip-flop rate
of doxorubicin. LNCaP cells were cultured with or without soraphen (100 nmol/L) for 72 h. During the last 24 h, NBD-DHPE (10 μmol/L) was added to the
cells. An hour before analysis, the cells were treated with vehicle or verapamil (100 μmol/L). Equal amounts of cells were collected, doxorubicin (10 μmol/L)
was added, and the NBD fluorescence was continuously monitored to determine the level of quenching by doxorubicin (n = 4). B and C, effect of
soraphen on doxorubicin accumulation. LNCaP cells were cultured in the presence or absence of soraphen (100 nmol/L) and palmitic acid (75 μmol/L) for
72 h. Doxorubicin (10 μmol/L) was added and, 2 h later, visualized by fluorescence microscopy (B) and quantified by fluorimetry (n = 4; C). D, effect of
soraphen and palmitic acid on doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. LNCaP cells were treated with soraphen and palmitic acid as in C. During the last 24 h,
doxorubicin (4 μmol/L) or vehicle was added. The cells were collected and stained with trypan blue to assess the cell viability (n = 6–12). E, effect of
soraphen on doxorubicin-induced cell death in other cancer cell lines. 22Rv1, PC-3, and BT474 cells were treated with or without 100 nmol/L soraphen
for 72 h and with 4 μmol/L doxorubicin or vehicle during the last 24 h (n = 3). F, effect of RNAi targeting lipogenic genes on doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity.
LNCaP and HCT116 cells were transfected with 50 nmol/L siRNA targeting FASN or ACC (siRNA), respectively, or with control siRNA (siCtrl). During
the last 24 h, cells were exposed to 2 or 4 μmol/L doxorubicin, respectively (n = 3). Columns, mean; bars, SE. *, P < 0.05, significantly different from control/
siCtrl; #, P < 0.05, significantly different from both soraphen/siRNA and doxorubicin alone.

Lipogenesis Promotes Membrane Lipid Saturation

obtained in the presence of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor verapamil (Fig. 6A). The increased flip-flop rate was accompanied
by a significant increase in the intracellular accumulation of
doxorubicin, as assessed by fluorescence microscopy and fluorimetric analysis of cellular extracts and as shown also for
22Rv1 and PC-3 cells (Fig. 6B and C; Supplementary Fig. S5).
Addition of exogenous palmitic acid counteracted the effects
of soraphen (Fig. 6C). Soraphen treatment markedly sensitized LNCaP cells to the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin,
which was consistent with the increased accumulation of
doxorubicin in soraphen-treated cells and their increased
susceptibility to cell death. LNCaP cells grown under standard
culture conditions were fairly resistant to doxorubicininduced cell death (8% cell death at 4 μmol/L; Fig. 6D), but
pretreatment with soraphen, which alone induced death in
up to 20% of the cells, increased the rate of cell death to
∼50%. This potent effect was synergistic, as assessed using
the CI method (Supplementary Fig. S6; ref. 35). Addition of exogenous palmitic acid counteracted these effects and largely
rescued the cells from death (Fig. 6D). Concordant results
were obtained with the prostate cancer cell lines 22Rv1 and
PC-3 and with the breast cancer cell line BT474 (Fig. 6E). Similarly, knockdown of the lipogenic pathway with siRNA sensitized the cancer cells for doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity
(Fig. 6F). These findings suggest that increased lipogenesis in
cancer cells may limit the uptake of chemotherapeutics and,
together with the mentioned changes in susceptibility to cell
death, may render cancer cells less susceptible to cytotoxic
agents. Conversely, these data provide a new rationale for
the use of lipogenesis inhibitors to increase the efficacy of
chemotherapeutic agents.

Conclusion
The results from this study show that the implications of
increased lipogenesis, which frequently accompanies cancer

progression, extend beyond its commonly accepted role in
providing lipids for rapid cell proliferation, as we provide direct evidence that cancer cells promote saturation of their
membranes and modulate their biophysical properties by activating de novo lipogenesis. As (mono-un)saturated lipids
are less susceptible to lipid peroxidation, this shift may protect cancer cells from lipid peroxidation–mediated cell death.
It also alters membrane dynamics and affects the uptake and
efficacy of chemotherapeutics. The findings from this study
suggest that tumor-associated lipogenesis confers a significant advantage to cancer cells, as it helps them to survive
both carcinogenic- and therapeutic-mediated insults. This
study also provides a novel strategy for the use of lipogenesis
inhibitors for therapeutic intervention, particularly as therapy sensitizers.
