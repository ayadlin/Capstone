BACKGROUND. Southwest Oncology Group protocol 0026 evaluated interferon
alpha-2b plus thalidomide in patients with disseminated melanoma. Endpoints
were 6-month progression-free survival rate, response rate, and toxicity.

METHODS. Twenty-six patients with Stage IV melanoma, measurable or nonmeasurable disease, performance status of 0–2, and adequate renal and hepatic functions were registered. One prior systemic therapy for Stage IV disease was
required. Interferon was administered subcutaneously (1 million U) twice daily;
thalidomide was orally administered (200–400 mg) each evening in a dose-esca-

elanoma incidence is increasing in the US1,2; annual rates have
increased almost 10-fold over the past 50 years. The lifetime
risk for people in the US and Australia approaches 1 in 25 individuals, and melanoma is now the fifth most common cancer in men
and sixth most common in women in the US.2 Most cases are diagnosed and surgically treated at an early, curable stage, so 5-year survival rates have improved approximately 10% over the last 30
years.1,2–5 However, metastatic melanoma is very aggressive, with little hope for long-term survival (median survival, 4–8 months).1
Chemotherapy has not significantly impacted survival of patients
with metastatic disease. After extensive evaluation, a single agent,
dacarbazine (DTIC), remains the standard chemotherapeutic treatment, with a response rate of approximately 20%. Combination chem-

otherapy has been evaluated, particularly with platinum analogs and nitrosoureas with and without tamoxifen, but none of these regimens have shown
consistent improvement over single-agent DTIC in
randomized trials.1,4–6 Single-agent interferon alpha2b has a response rate below 25% and though IL-2 produces low but durable complete response rates, its toxicity has precluded widespread use.1,4–9 Combination
studies of these biologic and chemotherapeutic agents
have shown no benefit over chemotherapy alone.10,11
Tumor angiogenesis, necessary for tumor growth
and metastasis, is a promising target for new therapies.12–16 Interferon and thalidomide are antiangiogenic agents that have shown benefit as monotherapy
in other malignancies.17–20 In melanoma, interferon
alpha has been studied extensively, both alone and
combined with IL-2 and chemotherapy; its toxicities,
benefits, and mechanisms of action have been thoroughly described.1,6,17,21–29 In preclinical models optimal antiangiogenic effects are reportedly achieved
when low-dose interferon, equivalent to 1 million U, is
given twice daily27,30 Thalidomide alone or combined
with other agents induces tumor response and is associated with manageable toxicities in various solid
tumors and hematologic malignancies.18,31–34
We studied the combined therapy of interferon
alpha-2b, in the reported optimal antiangiogenic
dose and schedule, with daily oral thalidomide in
patients with metastatic melanoma who had received
prior systemic therapy. The objectives of this phase 2
study were to evaluate the 6-month progression-free
survival rate, complete and partial response rates in
patients with measurable disease, and qualitative
and quantitative toxicities associated with interferon
alpha-2b combined with thalidomide.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Eligible patients were accrued through the Southwest
Oncology Group (SWOG) and were required to have
histologically proven, surgically incurable stage IV
malignant melanoma. They must have had measurable or nonmeasurable disease, as defined by the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST), but only those with measurable disease
were included in the response analysis. All patients
were required to have computed tomography (CT) of
the abdomen, CT or magnetic resonance imaging of
the brain, and x-ray or CT of the chest. Patients with
a history of brain metastases were eligible only if the
metastases had been completely resected and then
treated with whole-brain radiation therapy. Patients
must have received only 1 prior systemic therapy

(chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, or
a combination) for stage IV disease. Patients may
have had prior biologic therapy, hormonal therapy,
isolation limb perfusion therapy, immunotherapy, or
chemotherapy given adjuvantly. Prior surgery or
radiation therapy was allowed, but must have been
completed at least 21 days before registration. Documentation of adequate hematologic, renal, and liver
function and a Zubrod performance status of 0–2
were required, as was Institutional Review Board approval and signed informed consent.
Patients with known acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome or human immunodeficiency virus-1–associated complex or those known to be seropositive for
human immunodeficiency virus antibody were ineligible. All patients were required to participate in and
comply with the System for Thalidomide Education
and Prescribing Safety (S.T.E.P.S.) Program.35 Female
patients who were pregnant or nursing were
excluded; women of childbearing potential were
required to have a serum pregnancy test performed
within 24 hours before registration, weekly for the
first 4 weeks, and then once every 4 weeks (or every
2 weeks if irregular menses). Patients were also
excluded based on any prior malignancy other than
adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ cervical cancer, other stage
I or II cancers from which the patient was in complete remission, or any other cancer from which the
patient had been disease-free for 5 years.

Treatment Plan
Interferon alpha-2b (1 million U) was administered
subcutaneously twice daily. Thalidomide was administered orally at bedtime, beginning with a dose of
200 mg on Days 1–7 and, as tolerated, escalated to
300 mg on Days 8–14 and 400 mg from Day 15
through study completion. Treatment was to continue
for 8 weeks after achieving complete response or until
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Disease
assessments were performed every 8 weeks using
RECIST and toxicities were assessed every 4 weeks by
using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v 2.0). In response to any toxicity greater
than grade 2, doses of both agents were held for up to
4 weeks and were resumed when toxicity resolved to
less than grade 2. Thalidomide doses were reduced by
50% for grade 1 or 2 neuropathy persisting more than
4 weeks. Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications were not allowed.
Statistical Analyses
The study’s primary goal was to evaluate the 6month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of patients

with disseminated malignant melanoma treated with
interferon alpha-2b and thalidomide. On the basis of
previous data from prior SWOG phase 2 trials in this
patient population, it was assumed that a true 6month PFS rate of 30% would be of considerable interest, but that the regimen would not be of interest
if the true 6-month PFS rate was less than 10%.
The accrual goal was 35 eligible patients. Eight
or more patients alive and progression-free beyond 6
months would be considered evidence that this regimen warranted further study. This design had an
87% power to detect a 30% 6-month PFS if it in fact
exists, while only having a 2% chance of incorrectly
declaring the regimen to be active if the true 6month PFS were 10% or less.

RESULTS
Twenty-six patients were accrued between November
1, 2001, and September 10, 2002. After 2 sudden
deaths and 1 grade 4 pulmonary embolism, the study
was closed.

Patient Characteristics
All 26 registered patients were eligible. Median age
was 61 years (range, 36–85 years). Patients were predominantly male and Caucasian. Twenty-two
patients had measurable disease (Table 1).
Protocol Compliance
There were no major protocol deviations. While on
protocol, there was good compliance as determined

from review of the data sheets; however, the treatment duration for most patients was short. The median number of 4-week cycles was 2 (range, 1–8
cycles). Seventeen of the 26 patients achieved a thalidomide dose level of 400 mg. Five patients were
removed from treatment because of adverse events, 2
died, 17 had disease progression, and 2 withdrew
from the study because of concerns over the regimen’s safety.

Treatment Response
Four eligible patients had no measurable disease at
baseline and were excluded from the response analysis. No objective responses were noted. The estimated response probability was 0 of 22 (95%
confidence interval [CI], 0%–15%), estimated 6month PFS was 15% (95% CI, 2%–29%; Fig. 1), and
estimated 6-month overall survival was 58% (95% CI,
39%–77%; Fig. 2). Overall survival and PFS estimates
were calculated using the method of Kaplan-Meier.36

none of the deaths were attributed to treatment. However, on re-review by the principal investigator once
the study was closed to accrual, 2 deaths were noted
to be sudden deaths that occurred at the patients’
homes and, by description, were compatible with
thromboembolisms or arrhythmias. Another patient
experienced a grade 3 DVT reported as unrelated to
treatment. Although the 2 deaths and grade 3 DVT
had an unclear relationship to the study agents, they
were cause for concern, as thalidomide is a known

enced grade 3 treatment-related adverse events. Other
notable toxicities included arrhythmias, constipation,
fatigue, and leukopenia. These toxicities occurred
early in the treatment (Table 3).
In the absence of responders, and in the absence
of encouraging PFS, the concern for patient safety
outweighed any benefit from reopening the study;
the study was permanently closed on May 1, 2003.

DISCUSSION
Our phase 2 clinical trial results were not encouraging. This treatment regimen failed to produce objective responses and had a 6-month PFS of only 15%.
Our patient cohort had advanced disease and had already progressed after 1 systemic therapy regimen;
thus, this was a poor-risk group predisposed to toxicity. Severe treatment-related toxicities included 1 pulmonary embolism, 2 cardiac arrhythmias, 2 sudden
deaths, and 1 DVT that had an unclear relationship
to the study agents. The known thrombogenic attributes of thalidomide are cause for concern.37,38
Interferon alpha-2b and thalidomide inhibit
angiogenesis and have shown antitumor efficacy as
monotherapies with low toxicity profiles. Thalidomide’s antitumor effects have been thoroughly investigated for a wide range of tumor types and malignant
diseases.19,20,39,40 In a case study of a single patient
presenting with multiple scalp melanoma lesions, thalidomide induced a complete response.41 In clinical
trials, 35% of thalidomide-treated metastatic melanoma patients achieved disease stabilization,42 and
thalidomide combined with temozolomide induced
complete or partial responses in 31% of patients with
metastatic melanoma.43
In a 1985 study, daily injections with interferon
alpha yielded 17% tumor response in metastatic

Phase 2 Study of Melanoma Treatment/Hutchins et al.

melanoma patients.21 A subsequent trial exploring
the addition of interferon alpha-2b to traditional
DTIC melanoma treatment found that 53% of
patients responded to the combination therapy, while
19% responded to DTIC monotherapy,44 although a
larger phase 3 trial could not confirm an additive
effect from the interferon.45 Studies in mice by Fidler
et al. revealed an optimal antiangiogenic dose for
interferon alpha-2b distinguished by the low dose
given on a continuous twice-daily schedule.27,30
The combination of thalidomide and interferon
alpha-2b has been investigated for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), most often with a higher dose and less
frequent schedule of interferon alpha-2b (5 million U
3 times per week). In these clinical trials, disease stabilization (27%–63%) was more frequently observed
than tumor response (7%–22%).46–48 Interferon alpha
and thalidomide combination therapy has not been
previously studied in humans with metastatic melanoma, but mice inoculated with a human melanoma
cell line experienced synergistic effects of antiangiogenesis and reduced tumor vessel density when the
drugs were used together.
In our study, we used a human equivalent dose to
Fidler’s of 1 million U of interferon alpha-2b twice
daily.50 We thought this dose combined with a maximum tolerable thalidomide dose would provide the
greatest antiangiogenic effect. Whether a different dose
or schedule would have resulted in less toxicity and
more efficacy cannot be determined from this study.
Although other studies have reported increased
thromboembolic events when thalidomide and interferon alpha-2b were used in combination, this finding
has not been consistent.46,51,52 The adverse thromboembolic effects of thalidomide are well known and
have been observed to increase when used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents.53–61 In patients
with metastatic melanoma, thalidomide combined
with temozolomide yielded significant adverse vascular events, with 10 of 26 patients discontinuing treatment because of these toxicities.62 A phase 2 clinical
trial studying these 2 drugs in melanoma patients
with brain metastases also yielded thromboembolic
events in 3 of 16 patients, 1 sudden death, and no
response to treatment—results similar to our observations.63 In addition, we chose an interferon alpha-2b
regimen optimized for antiangiogenesis, and as interferon alpha-2b therapy has been shown to diminish
endothelial cell function and induce apoptosis,28,64,65
a high level of endothelial cell death may have
increased the risk for thrombosis.
In 7 previous SWOG phase 2 studies of stage IV
melanoma, 3 thromboembolic events, all grade 3,
were observed in a population of 235 eligible patients

2273

(1%). Their relation to treatment was not recorded,
and SWOG’s toxicity classification criteria were redefined during the course of these studies. Nonetheless,
the probability of observing thrombotic events in at
least 4 of 26 patients, by chance, is considered to be
very small (< 2%).
In conclusion, it is impossible to determine
whether our unfavorable results were due to our
late-stage patient population or an adverse treatment
plan. Nonetheless, we observed that this regimen of
interferon alpha-2b and thalidomide demonstrated a
lack of response and excess toxicity in poor-prognosis patients with disseminated melanoma. Whether
or not anticoagulation in this patient population
would have altered the outcome remains unknown.
However, we conclude there is no indication for further study within these trial parameters.
