BACKGROUND. Functional activation of b-catenin/T-cell factor (Tcf) signaling
plays an important role in the early events of carcinogenesis. Recently, it was
demonstrated that adenomatous polyposis coli or b-catenin genes are mutated
frequently in gastric cancer cells. The objective of the current study was to use a
gene-targeting approach to kill human gastric cancer cells selectively with activated b-catenin/Tcf signaling.
METHODS. A recombinant adenovirus that carries a lethal gene (p53 up-regulated
modulator of apoptosis [PUMA]) under the control of a b-catenin/Tcf-responsive
promoter (AdTOP-PUMA) was used selectively to target gastric cancer cells (AGS)
that posses an active b-catenin/Tcf pathway. The combined effect of AdTOPPUMA and several chemotherapeutic agents (5-florouracil, doxorubicin, paclitaxel) also was evaluated. Cell viability was measured by methylene blue assay,
protein expression was measured by Western blot analysis, and cell cycle and apoptosis were evaluated by fluorescent-activated cell sorter analysis.
RESULTS. The TOP-PUMA adenovirus inhibited AGS cell growth in a dose- and
time-dependent fashion. Growth inhibition was associated with the up-regulation
of PUMA expression and the induction of apoptosis. Chemotherapy synergistically enhanced the killing effect of AdTOP-PUMA.

CONCLUSIONS. Selective targeting of gastric cancer cells with the activated b-catenin pathway may be a novel and effective therapy in gastric cancer. Combination
of this gene-therapy approach with standard therapy may improve efficacy and
reduce toxicity. Cancer 2007;109:188–97.  2006 American Cancer Society.

astric cancer is among of the most common and deadly cancers worldwide, accounting for >870,000 new diagnoses and
>650,000 deaths annually.1 Mortality from gastric cancer is second
only to lung cancer. Despite advances in conventional cancer treatment strategies, the prognosis for patients with gastric cancer is
poor, with reported overall 5-year survival rates that rarely exceed
20%. Thus, gastric cancer is a disease that requires the development
of new therapeutic modalities.
b-Catenin is a multifunctional protein that exerts 2 important
functions in epithelial cells. These diverse functions are realized
through interaction with various binding partners. In nonstimulated
cells, b-catenin is associated largely with E-cadherin and connects
it, through a-catenin, to the actin cytoskeleton.2 It is well known
that tyrosine phosphorylation of b-catenin regulates adherence
junction complex formation and cell-cell adhesion.3,4 When it is not
bound to E-cadherin, b-catenin enters the nucleus, acting as a transcriptional coactivator, through association with the T-cell factor

(Tcf)/lymphoid-enhancer factor (Lef) transcription
factor. Large numbers of genes that are relevant for
tumor formation and progression have been identified as activated transcriptionally by the b-catenin/
Tcf complex. Some of those genes are implicated in
growth control and cell cycling (c-Myc, c-Jun, fra-1,
cyclin D1, and gastrin), some are relevant for cell survival (Id2, MDR1), and some are implicated in tumor
invasion and metastasis (matrilysin, vascular endothelial growth factor).5–11
In normal cells, most b-catenin protein is present at the cell-cell junctions, and very little is present
in the cytoplasm or the nucleus because of its rapid
degradation by the proteasome. In the cytoplasm, in
the absence of the secreted factor, Wnt, b-catenin is
rapidly phosphorylated and degraded by the Axin-adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-glycogen synthase
kinase (GSK) 3b complex. This phosphorylated
b-catenin is recognized by b-TrCP, which is an F-box
component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that
promotes ubiquitination of b-catenin and increases
its susceptibility to degradation by ubiquitin-proteasome system.12 Disheveled (Dsh) activation by Wnt
blocks the ability of GSK3b to phosphorylate b-catenin. This stabilization of b-catenin is detected in different types of cancer.13 Cytosolic b-catenin protein
also can be stabilized by mutational inactivation of
the APC gene, usually leading to a truncated protein
product, or by b-catenin mutations at regulatory
amino-terminal serine residues. When the failure of
this degradation in cells occurs, b-catenin proteins
are accumulated in cytoplasm, and some of them
translocate into the nucleus, leading to activation of
the Tcf/Lef transcription factor. Activated b-catenin/
Tcf signaling by accumulation of b-catenin in the
nucleus has been implicated in human carcinogenesis, including melanoma, hepatoma, and gastric carcinomas.13–15 These data strongly suggest that the
dysregulation of b-catenin/Tcf signaling may be
involved in the development of a broad range of
human malignancies. Some studies on the effect of
b-catenin/Tcf signaling in gastric cancer recently
were performed. Nakatsuru et al.16 reported APC
mutations in 12 of 46 gastric cancers. Clements
et al.17 reported that b-catenin nuclear localization
occurred in approximately 33% of gastric tumors and
that b-catenin mutations occur in both diffuse- and
intestinal-type gastric cancers. p53 Up-regulated
modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) is a potent mediator
of the p53 apoptotic response,18,19 It belongs to the
group of BH3-only proteins, which have been shown
to function by dimerization with other BH3 domaincontaining proteins, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, that
results in cytochrome C release from the mitochon-

caspases 3 and 9.20
Although a growing number of cancer patients
have benefited from modern therapeutic methods,
there remains a great need to increase the efficacy
and reduce the toxicity of cancer therapy. Human
clinical trials have suggested that gene therapy is
expected to join surgical, radiologic, and chemotherapeutic strategies in future methods.21–24 To make
the treatment effective and safe, the transgene
should be expressed only in tumor cells and not in
normal gastric epithelial cells. In the current study,
we demonstrated that induction of the PUMA gene
under the control of promoter containing wild-type
Tcf/Lef-binding sites resulted in preferential killing
of gastric cancer cells with hyperactive b-catenin/Tcf
activity. Combining this strategy with standard chemotherapy resulted in a synergistic growth inhibition
of gastric cancer cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
Human gastric cancer cells lines (AGS and N87),
human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines (HCT116
and LS174T), human pancreatic cell lines (Colo357
and Panc-1), and embryonic kidney cell lines (293)
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (Sigma, Rehovot,
Israel) that contained from 5% to 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek,
Israel), 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin at 378C in
an atmosphere of 95% oxygen and 5% CO2 (complete
medium). KATO III human gastric cancer cells were
grown in RPMI medium (Sigma) that contained 15%
FBS, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin.
Construction of Plasmids and Adenoviral Vectors
To construct the Tcf-responsive promoter (TOP) and
the corresponding control plasmid that contains mutant Tcf-binding oligomers (FOP) (TOP/FOP)-cFosLuciferase (Luc) plasmids, an XbaI fragment that
contained the TOP-cFos (wild-type sequence of bcatenin/Tcf binding site) and the FOP-cFos (corresponding control plasmid that contains mutant Tcfbinding oligomers) from TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH
plasmids (generous gifts from Hans Clevers, Utrecht
University, Utrecht, the Netherlands) was cloned into
the NheI site upstream to the Luc gene in the pGL3basic plasmid (Promega, Rehovot, Israel) (see the
TOP and FOP sequences, Fig. 1A). The AdEasy system25 was used to generate the AdTOP-PUMA
and AdFOP-PUMA (AdTOP/FOP-PUMA) adenoviruses

(D) The human gastric cancer cell lines AGS, N87, and KATO III were infected with wild-type AdTOP-PUMA, mutant AdFOP-PUMA, and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter adenoviruses (Ad-CMV-GFP) in 96-well culture plates. Cell viability was
measured by methylene blue staining 48 hours after adenoviral infection. Cell viability was expressed as the percent absorbance relative to mock-infected cells.
The average of 2 independent experiments with 6 replicates is shown. Statistical difference was observed between AdTOP-PUMA and the control groups
(AdFOP-PUMA and Ad-CMV-GFP) at 5 multiplicity of infection (MOI) and 10 MOI (P < .001 and P < .01, respectively). (E) The numbers of viable cells are proportional to the intensity of methylene blue staining shown here for AGS cells 48 hours after adenoviral infection.

(Fig. 1B). The TOP and FOP sequences were obtained
from the TOP-cFos-Luc and FOP-cFos-Luc plasmids
and were cloned into the shuttle vector, pAd-Track.
The pAdTrack also contains a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The blunted HA-PUMA fragment
(containing the human PUMA combinational DNA
[cDNA] fused to a double hemagglutinin [HA]-epitope
tag) from pCEP4-PUMA (a generous gift from Bert
Vogelstein, The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD) was cloned downstream to the TOP/FOP
elements in the pAd-Track vectors. The resultant plasmids were designated pAdTrack-TOP/FOP-PUMA.
These shuttle vectors were linearized with PmeI and
cotransformed with E1-deleted adenoviral backbone
AdEasy-1 into the competent bacterial strain BJ5183,
which enables efficient recombination. Panels of adenoviruses Ad-TOP-PUMA and Ad-FOP-PUMA recombinants were generated.

Adenovirus Production and Titering
To produce viruses, 4 mg of PacI-linearized adenoviral DNA was transfected into 50% to 70% confluent
293 cells in 10-cm dishes using LipofectAMINE and
Plus Reagents (Invitrogene Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Between 5 and 7 days post-transfection,
colonies that expressed GFP were observed under a
fluorescent microscope, the cells were harvested and
lysed in phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) by 4
cycles of freeze/thaw/vortex. The supernatant was
collected, and 50% of it was used to reinfect 50% to
70% confluent 293 cells. Viruses were collected 2 to 3
days postinfection when a cytopathic effect became
evident. Further amplification and concentration of
virus stocks were achieved through several rounds of
infections. To titer the viruses, 50% to 70% confluent
293 cells in 96-well dishes were infected with serial
dilutions of the virus stocks. GFP-positive colonies
were counted 5 days postinfections.

Targeting b-catenin in Gastric Cancer/Dvory-Sobol et al.

The control Ad-CMV-GFP adenovirus containing
the GFP gene under the control of a full-length CMV
promoter (Fig. 1B) was a kind gift of Hila Giladi
(Hadassah School of Medicine, Jerusalem, Israel), and
it was amplified in 293 cells. Human cDNA of caspase8, Bak, and Bax were a kind gift from Atan Gross
(Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). The
expression construct of PUMA was generous gifts from
Bert Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center,
Baltimore, MD). PKGIb, which encodes a mutant PKG
sequence with an N-terminal truncation,26 was a gift
from I. Bernard Weinstein (Columbia University, New
York, NY). This deletion renders PKG independent of
cGMP, and it is constitutively active.

Luc Assay
Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE
and Plus Reagents (Invitrogene) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In total, 5  105 cells
were seeded in 6-well plates. The next day, 50% confluent dishes were cotransfected with 1 mg of vectors
plus 0.1 mg of pRL-TK (Promega). Luc assay was performed 24 hours post-transfection. Briefly, cells were
washed once with PBS and lysed in 400 mL of lysis
buffer for 15 minutes at room temperature. The
lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 revolutions per
minute for 5 minutes, and 20 mL of each lysate were
used to measure Luc reporter gene expression. Luc
activity was normalized to Renilla Luc activity from a
parallel cotransfection of pRL-TK (Dual Luc system;
Promega). All experiments were performed in triplicate at least 3 times and yielded similar results.
Cell Viability Assay and Chemicals
Between 2  104 and 5  104 cells in 100 mL of complete media were plated in 96-well dishes. The next
day, 6 wells were infected with each adenovirus at a
different multiplicity of infection (MOI) (from 0.1
MOI to 50 MOI). Cell viability was assessed by methylene blue staining after 48 hours. The cells were
washed once with PBS and fixed in 150 mL formaldehyde (4%) for 2 hours at room temperature; washed
with 0.1 M sodium borate, pH 8.5; stained with 0.5%
methylene blue for 10 minutes; then washed with
tap water and 150 mL of 0.1 M HCl to dilute the cellbound dye. Absorbance was measured at 590 nm.
Cell viability was expressed as the percentage absorbance relative to mock-infected cells. The average
of at least 2 independent experiments with 6 replicates was recorded.
Chemicals
Paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and 5-florouracil (5-FU) were
obtained from Sigma. Cells were infected with

191

AdTOP-PUMA, AdFOP-PUMA, or Ad-CMV-GFP (5
MOI). After 5 hours, they were treated with 0.05 mM
paclitaxel, 1 mM doxorubicin, or 0.05 mM 5-FU, and
the cells were cultured for 48 hours.

Western Blot Analysis
Infected cells were harvested and protein concentrations determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). An equal amount of protein
from each lysate was analyzed by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the
proteins were transferred to Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Life Science). Membranes were blocked with buffer containing 5% lowfat milk and 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS for 1 hour, incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hour with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and developed
with a Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Antibodies against HA
and actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Apoptosis Analysis
Flow cytometry
Cells were plated at 5  106/10 cm per dish 24 hours
before infection and were infected with recombinant
adenoviral vectors at 5 and 10 MOI. Twenty-four
hours later, both adherent and floating cells were
harvested, washed with PBS, fixed in 80% ethanol for
1 hour, and stained with propidium iodide for analysis of DNA content. The number of subdiploid cells,
representing apoptotic cells, was quantified by a fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACScan) using CellQuest software (Becton-Dickinson Immunocytometry
Systems, San Jose, CA). Necrotic cells were excluded
by staining with Trypan blue. The average of at least
3 independent experiments with 2 replicates was
recorded.
Single-stranded DNA
For the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) assay, 104 cells
were seeded in 96-well microplates and, after 24 hours,
infected with recombinant adenoviral vectors at 5
MOI. The next day, the ssDNA apoptosis enzymelinked immunosorbent assay kit was used (Chemicon
International Inc., Temecula, CA). Based on the selective, formamide-induced denaturation of DNA, this
method identifies apoptotic cells27 by staining ssDNA
using a mixture of anti-ssDNA monoclonal antibody
and peroxidase-conjugated antimouse immunoglobulin M. The average of at least 2 independent experiments with 2 replicates was recorded.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using InStat software (version 3.01; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego,
CA). In the tissue-culture experiments, comparisons
between 2 samples were performed using the Student
t test, and comparisons between >2 samples were performed using a 1-way ordinary parametric analysis of
variance followed by a Tukey-Kramer multiple-comparison test. For all statistical tests, preliminary evaluation of the homoscadacity and normality of the
compared samples was performed using Bartlett and
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, respectively.

RESULTS
Up-Regulation of the b-Catenin/Tcf Signaling Pathway
in Gastric Cancer
b-Catenin/Tcf-dependent activity in different cell
lines is shown in Figure 1C. b-Catenin/Tcf-dependent activity was determined in human CRC cell lines
(LS174T and HCT116), in a gastric cancer cell line
(AGS), and in pancreatic cancer cell lines (Colo357
and Panc-1). LS174T cells harbored mutant APC protein, HCT116, and AGS, have mutant b-catenin protein, and Colo357 and Panc-1 cells have intact Wnt
signaling.28–32
PUMA Induces Cell Death
To identify the most potent proapoptotic gene, we
tested several full-length cDNAs, including Bak, caspase-8, PUMA, PKGIb, Bax, and Bid. The proapoptotic
effect of the different genes was evaluated in 293 cells,
because the transfection efficacy in transformed CRC
and gastric cell lines is very low (7%). All the genes
mentioned above were expressed under a strong
human CMV promoter to allow the most efficient
expression. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the
number of subdiploid DNA-containing cells, representing apoptotic cells, was quantified by FACScan (Table 1).
PUMA induced the highest apoptotic activity.
AdTOP-PUMA Selectively Induces Cell Death in Gastric
Cancer Cells
Next, we employed an adenoviral vector selected for
gene delivery with PUMA placed downstream to the
cFos minimal promoter. The promoter contained either the wild-type (AdTOP-PUMA) or the mutant
(AdFOP-PUMA) Tcf/Lef binding sites. The Ad-CMVGFP vector was used as a control for viral toxicity.
The ability of AdTOP-PUMA and AdFOP-PUMA adenoviral vectors to kill AGS cells was evaluated by
cell-viability assays 48 hours after infection with adenoviruses at varying doses (Figs. 1D,E, 2). AGS cells
that displayed elevated b-catenin transactivation

(Fig. 1C) were killed efficiently by infection with AdTOP-PUMA in a dose-dependent manner. The number of viable cells after infection with AdTOP-PUMA
was proportional to the methylene blue color intensity, as shown for AGS cells infected with adenoviral
constructs (Fig. 1D,E). N87 cells, which were derived
from liver metastasis that originated from gastric
cancer, and KATO III cells, which are gastric cancer
cells that do not harbor an active b-catenin pathway
and do not display the protein in the nucleus,32 also
were exposed to the 3 viral constructs. Their growth
was not inhibited by any of the viral constructs (Fig.
1D). The ability of AdTOP-PUMA (but not AdFOPPUMA) adenoviral vectors to kill cells selectively with
active Wnt signaling was confirmed in CRC and hepatic cancer cells.33

Activated b-Catenin/Tcf Signaling Specifically Induces
Apoptosis by Up-Regulating PUMA Expression
To further confirm that AdTOP-PUMA induced apoptosis, the cells were stained with propidium iodide
and were analyzed for the fraction of hypodiploid
cells by flow cytometry. Apoptosis could be detected
in AGS cells as early as 24 hours postinfection. The
AGS cell line showed only a low background level of
cell death after treatment with AdFOP-PUMA or AdCMV-GFP (Fig. 3A). The effect of the AdTOP-PUMA
was dose-dependent, as shown in Figure 3, 24 hours
and 48 hours postinfection (Fig. 3A,B, respectively).
KATO III cells, which do not harbor an active b-catenin pathway, did not show any changes in their cell
cycle distribution 48 hours after infection (Fig. 3C).
Apoptosis induced by AdTOP-PUMA also was
detected in AGS cells 48 hours after infection by the
ssDNA assay (Fig. 4A). The number of apoptotic cells
was proportional to the color intensity of cell, as

treatment at all. Cells were harvested after 48 hours, and the lysates, which were normalized for protein concentration, were analyzed by Western blot using
antihemagglutinin (HA) for PUMA detection and anti-b-actin antibodies. The positive control for PUMA-HA protein at 25 kilodaltons was a lysate of SW480

To demonstrate that the observed cell death was
caused by the controlled expression of PUMA, we analyzed PUMA expression by Western blot. High levels of
PUMA expression were detected in AdTOP-PUMA
infected cells, but not in AdFOP-PUMA or Ad-CMVGFP infected cells (Fig. 4C). No increase in PUMA levels
was seen in N87 cells with any of the viral constructs
(Fig. 4C), which confirms that the AdTOP-PUMA is a bcatenin/Tcf inducible expression vector. Taken together,
these data suggest that AdTOP-PUMA is capable of
inducing selective death in gastric cancer cells that
have elevated b-catenin/Tcf transcriptional activity.

either AdTOP-PUMA, AdFOP-PUMA, or Ad-CMV-GFP
adenoviruses (at 5 MOI) and were cultured for
48 hours in the presence or absence of paclitaxel
(0.05 mM), doxorubicin (1 mM), or 5-FU (0.05 mM)
(Fig. 5). The AdTOP-PUMA adenovirus dramatically
enhanced the killing effects by 3 chemotherapeutic
agents in AGS cells. The efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agents was not augmented by exposure of the
different cells to either Ad-CMV-GFP or AdFOPPUMA adenovirus constructs (Fig. 5).

potent proapoptotic gene PUMA. This gene-therapy
approach, combined with standard chemotherapy,
may pave the way for a novel therapy modality for
patients with this devastating cancer.
One of the major hurdles in gene therapy is difficulty in delivering the appropriate gene to the target
cells. Adenoviruses may be the right solution. Adenoviruses are easy to produce: They have a very high,
effective nuclear-entry mechanism with a very low
pathogenicity in humans.34 The virus does not integrate into the host cell genome; thus, it has the capability to incorporate relatively larger segments of
DNA into the adenovirus vector.
Similar strategies in the setting of colon cancer
recently were reported.35,36 In the work by Chen and
McCormick,35 an adenoviral vector AdWt-Fd, which
contained the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter carrying the proapoptotic gene Fadd, selectively killed
CRC cells in vitro. Kwong et al.36 used an in-vitro/invivo animal model similar to the model used in the
current study. Those authors demonstrated selective
killing of DLD-1 CRC cells in an ex-vivo animal
model by using the adenoviral vector AdTOP-CMVTK, which contains a herpes simplex virus TK gene
under the control of a b-catenin/Tcf-responsive promoter that is linked to a minimal CMV promoter.
Lipinski et al.37 optimized the activity and specificity
profile of a synthetic b-catenin-dependent promoter
by varying its basal promoter, the number of Tcf
binding sites, and the distance between them and
the basal promoter. The optimal promoter showed
virtually undetectable expression in cells with normal
b-catenin regulation but displayed high levels in cells
that expressed deregulated b-catenin. Malerba et al.38
inserted Tcf binding sites into the viral P4 promoter

and showed that reduction of the number of Tcf sites
from 4 to 2 leads to an increase in the efficiency of
replication and toxicity of the virus in Co115 colon
cancer cells.
In the current study, we took this strategy further
in several aspects: Several genes that have known
associations with the induction of apoptosis (Bax,
Bak, Bid, caspase 8) were evaluated for their apoptotic effect. Among them, PUMA was identified as the
most effective. Only 2 more recent reports have
demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of PUMA in
the setting of malignant glioma39 and esophageal
carcinoma cells.40 Adenovirus-mediated p53 gene
transfer has been studied extensively to evaluate its
clinical application in gene therapy for various cancers. However, some cancer cells are resistant to p53

p53-dependent apoptosis after DNA damage,18,19
may serve as a good alternative to p53-based gene
therapy, because it may kill cancer cells directly.
In the current study, we demonstrated that the
combination of a gene therapy approach with chemotherapeutic agents that have distinct mechanisms
of action may be an effective strategy for achieving
better antitumor response. We demonstrated that the
combination of AdTOP-PUMA adenovirus and paclitaxel, doxorubicin, or 5-FU dramatically enhanced
the cell-killing effects. This combination strategy
may be very useful in the treatment of chemotherapy-resistant cells and may minimize the toxicity of
this regimen. In a clinical setting, combination therapy using adenoviruses and chemotherapeutic agents
is most suitable in the setting of metastatic disease.
However, it may be used as adjunct therapy in
patients with stage II and III disease with the objec-

tive of preventing residual tumor growth by destroying microscopic cancer foci.
Recently, we showed a proof of concept in a similar model. Using a Ras-responsive element, selective
killing of ras transformed (but not normal) enterocytes was achieved in an in vitro model of CRC.43
In conclusion, the usefulness of a recombinant
adenovirus that expresses the lethal gene PUMA and
selectively kills gastric cancer cells was demonstrated
in the current study. This strategy is not restricted to
a cell or organ but can be used in practically all
transformed cells with an active b-catenin/Tcf pathway.44,45
