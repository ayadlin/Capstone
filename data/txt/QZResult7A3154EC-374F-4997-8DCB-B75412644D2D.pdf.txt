New Oral Small Molecules in the Treatment of Chronic
Lymphocytic Leukemia
Nicole Lamanna, MD

There has been a dramatic change in therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) over the last 20 years. In 1990, available therapy
produced complete responses in <5% of treated patients. This is in marked contrast to modern regimens, which are reported to reliably
produce complete responses in approximately 40% to 50% of patients. This remarkable improvement has been attributable to combination chemoimmunotherapy agents that have contributed to the backbone of therapy for patients with CLL. However, the disease is still
incurable and these modern treatment regimens have been somewhat limited to the treatment of younger, physically “fit” patients with
CLL due to their increased toxicity, including enhanced myelosuppression and immunosuppression. In addition, because patients receive
multiple therapies during the course of their lifetime, the mounting toxicities as well as decreased efficacy often limit the repeated use of
these more aggressive combination therapies. Fortunately, over the past 5 years, there has been an explosion of new active agents that
have demonstrated remarkable activity in patients with recurrent/refractory disease as well as those who harbor poor cytogenetic
abnormalities. The current review focuses on some of the novel small molecules that have either been approved or are at the forefront of

INTRODUCTION
Over the last 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the frequency of complete responses (CRs) achieved with the
initial treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Despite this progress, to the best of our knowledge, no current
treatment modality has yet been shown to be curative (except potentially allogeneic stem cell transplant). In addition, the
median age of patients at the time of diagnosis in the United States is 72 years, which often limits the usefulness of many
standard chemoimmunotherapy regimens because of increased toxicity in this age group. In the setting of recurrent disease, response durations typically are of shorter duration than those noted with initial therapy and with mounting toxicities from increased exposure to chemotherapeutic agents and poorer immune function, the treatment of patients with
relapsed/refractory disease can often be a challenge. In addition, patients with poor-risk cytogenetics (such as those with
deletion of the 17p chromosome) or unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene (IgVH) have inferior
responses to most traditional treatments with often shorter durations of response and decreased overall survival (OS). CLL
cells depend on host factors in the tissue microenvironment for survival and proliferation. Fortunately, several small molecule inhibitors have recently been developed that interrupt the signaling pathways responsible for the support, development, expansion, and survival of CLL cells. These agents have demonstrated favorable activity in patients with recurrent/
refractory disease, as well as older patients and patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. These agents have the
added benefit of being more selective because they target several of these key pathways (for example the B-cell receptor)
with less toxicity than traditional chemoimmunotherapy programs. The current review highlights some of the leading
small molecule inhibitors in clinical development (or that have recently been approved), noting that there are many more
agents currently in earlier stages of development (Fig. 1).
B-Cell Receptor Signaling Pathway Inhibitors

In vitro, CLL cells depend on appropriate microenvironmental factors or otherwise the cells undergo apoptosis. The CLL
cells depend on the same pathways that promote normal B-cell development, proliferation, and survival.1-5 Our

understanding of the B-cell receptor signaling (BCR)
pathway and its role in the survival of CLL cells has
allowed for multiple new targets of various kinases in the
pathway. There have been several small molecule inhibitors of BCR-associated kinases such as Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and
spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) that have already demonstrated marked clinical activity in patients with B-cell
malignancies, including CLL (Fig. 2).
BTK Inhibition
Ibutinib

The furthest along in development and recently approved
in both mantle cell lymphoma and CLL (approved in
February 2014 for patients with previously treated CLL),
ibrutinib is an orally bioavailable inhibitor that forms a
1918

covalent bone with BTK cysteine-481 residue.6,7 BTK
mutations in humans cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which leads to the absence of peripheral blood B cells
and decreased levels of serum immunoglobulin, resulting
in increased susceptibility to infections. BTK is essential
for the activation of several constitutively active pathways
of CLL cell survival, including the AKT, extracellular
sign-regulated kinase, and nuclear factor kappa-lightchain enhancer of activated B cell pathways. In addition,
BTK is essential to chemokine-mediated homing and adhesion of B cells. Preclinical studies have shown that in
primary CLL cells, ibrutinib has proapoptotic, antiproliferative, and stromal inhibitory properties.8-10 There are
many clinical trials with ibrutinib that have either been
completed or are currently ongoing. Below is a summary
of some of these noteworthy studies.

Ibrutinib as monotherapy

In an early phase 1 trial with ibrutinib, there was no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) reached with mild to moderate toxicity and clinical activity was noted in 56 patients
with recurrent/refractory B-cell malignancies.11 The median age of the patients in this study was 65 years (range,
41 years-82 years), with 16 patients with CLL enrolled
(29%). The study noted responses in 60% of the 50 evaluable patients (including CR frequency in 16% of patients)
with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 13.6
months (20 patients remained on study at the time of data
cutoff with the longest treatment exposure of >20 months
noted in 4 patients). This prompted a phase 1B/2 study of
ibrutinib in patients with recurrent/refractory CLL or
small lymphocytic lymphoma reported by Byrd et al.12
There were 2 doses used in the 85 patients (51 patients
received 420 mg and 34 patients received 840 mg). The
median age of the patients was 66 years (range, 37 years82 years). On the basis of early data from the first cohort
treated at the dose of 420 mg, a third cohort of patients
was added to study the effect of a 420-mg dose in patients
with high-risk disease, resulting in 51 patients being
treated at this dose. In general, the patients were considered to have high-risk disease with a median of 4 prior
therapies; 33% had deletions of 17p and 36% had deleCancer

tions of 11q. According to standard criteria, the overall
response (OR) frequency was 71% (2 CRs and 34 partial
responses [PRs]) in the cohort treated with the 420-mg
dose and 71% (24 PRs) in the cohort treated with 840-mg
dose. Given the lymphocytosis that occurs concomitantly
as lymphnodes decrease, an additional 15 patients (18%)
achieved a PR with persistent lymphocytosis. It is important to note that the response to ibrutinib did not appear
to vary according to traditional high-risk prognostic features. For example, the response rate among patients with
a deletion of 17p was 68% (including 1 CR). In addition,
durable responses were noted irrespective of dose. At the
time of the publication, at a median follow-up of 20.9
months, 54 patients (64%) were still receiving treatment
whereas 31 patients (36%) had discontinued therapy. The
26-month estimated PFS rate was 75% and the OS rate
was 83%. Reasons for discontinuation included disease
progression in 11 patients (13%), with 7 of those patients
having biologic transformation; 13 patients (15%) were
discontinued electively either by themselves or their physician; and 7 patients (8%) had adverse events, including 3
patients who had pneumonia, 2 who had sepsis, 1 patient
with staph bacteremia, and 1 patient who experienced a
gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The most common grade 1/
2 toxicities observed were diarrhea (47%), fatigue (28%),
1919

upper respiratory tract infections (33%), cough (31%),
arthralgia (27%), rash (27%), pyrexia (22%), and peripheral edema (21%).
In the same phase 1B/2 trial reported by Byrd
et al,12 a cohort of previously untreated patients with CLL
was also enrolled at both dose cohorts (but the 840-mg
dose level was subsequently discontinued due to the comparable activity at either dose level). O’Brien et al recently
reported these results of ibrutinib as initial therapy for
older patients (aged >65 years) with CLL.13 Twenty-nine
patients with CLL and 2 with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) were enrolled with a median age of 71 years
(range, 65 years-84 years), with 23 patients (74%) aged
70 years. There were 22 responses (71%) observed at a
median follow-up of 22 months: 4 patients (13%) had
CRs, 1 patient (3%) had a nodular PR, and 17 patients
(55%) had PRs. The median PFS was not reached, with
only 1 patient developing disease progression, thereby
making the PFS rate at 24 months 96.3% and the OS rate
was 96.6%. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (grade 3 in 13% of patients), nausea, and fatigue
that was often self-limited and resolved without discontinuation of the drug. Three patients (10%) developed grade
3 infections. With regard to hematologic toxicity, 1
patient developed grade 3 neutropenia and 1 patient
developed grade 4 thrombocytopenia.
Ibrutinib combinations

Early on, it was postulated that the addition of ibrutinib
to other agents may abrogate the lymphocytosis noted
with the use of ibrutinib alone and may further increase
the frequency of responses observed. A phase 2 study of
ibrutinib in combination with rituximab in patients with
high-risk CLL was reported by Burger et al.14 High risk in
this study consisted of patients with high-risk cytogenetic
abnormalities (specifically deletion of 17p, TP53 mutations, or deletion of 11q) or a short PFS (<36 months) after previous first-line chemoimmunotherapy. A total of
40 patients with a median age of 65 years (range, 35 years82 years) who had received a median of 2 prior therapies
(range, 1-4 prior therapies) were reported. Patients
received ibrutinib at a dose of 420 mg once daily plus
weekly rituximab (at a dose of 375 mg/m2) for weeks 1 to
4, then monthly until cycle 6. Ibrutinib was continued
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
occurred. The combination produced an OR rate of 95%
(38 of 40 patients) with a CR frequency of 10%. At a median follow-up of 18 months, 31 patients (78%) remained
on treatment with ibrutinib, with an OS rate of 84%. In
the 20 patients with either TP53 mutations or deletion of
1920

17p, the combination resulted in a 90% response rate.
The 18-month PFS rate was 78% in all patients. The
most common toxicities were low-grade diarrhea, bruising
and rashes, joint pain, nausea, fatigue, and upper respiratory infections. Grade 3 toxicities included lung infections, mucositis, inflammation of the digestive tract,
peripheral neuropathy, and pain/numbness in the hands
and feet. Eight patients withdrew from study: 2 due to
progressive disease, 1 because of mucositis, 2 with pneumonia, 1 due to ear and pulmonary infections, 1 with
Richter transformation, and 1 with unrelated progressive
disease and heart failure. One patient died of unknown
causes while in disease remission.
Brown et al also reported on the combination of
ibrutinib with bendamustine and rituximab in patients
with relapsed/refractory CLL.15 The median age of the
patients in this study was 62 years (range, 41 years-82
years), with a median of 2 prior therapies administered
(range, 1-3 prior therapies); 43% and 23% of patients,
respectively, had deletions of 17p and 11q. Patients
received up to 6 cycles of bendamustine and rituximab
with a continuous fixed ibrutinib dose of 420 mg/day.
Bendamustine was administered at a dose of 70 mg/m2 on
day 1 and day 2 combined with rituximab at a dose of
375 mg/m2 on day 1 for cycle 1 and 500 mg/m2 on day 1
for subsequent cycles. Ibrutinib dosing continued past 6
cycles until disease progression or another reason for discontinuation occurred. The OR in 30 patients was 93%,
which included 5 CRs and 3 nodular PRs. There were no
differences in responses observed based on risk features
such as 17p deletion. The median PFS was not yet reached
at the time of last follow-up, but the estimated PFS rate at
12 months was 90%. The regimen was well tolerated,
with the most frequent adverse events reported including
diarrhea (70%), nausea (67%), fatigue (47%), neutropenia (40%), and upper respiratory infections (37%), with
grade 3 adverse events including neutropenia (40%),
maculopapular rash (10%), and fatigue (10%) as well as
cellulitis, thrombocytopenia, and febrile neutropenia
(6.7% each).
Most recently, a phase 3 study comparing ibrutinib
with ofatumumab in previously treated patients with CLL
(RESONATE 1) was presented and published by Byrd
et al.16 A total of 391 patients were randomized to receive
either ibrutinib (at a dose of 420 mg daily) until disease
progression or unacceptable toxicity or intravenous ofatumumab for up to 24 weeks at an initial dose of 300 mg at
week 1 followed by a dose of 2000 mg weekly for 7 weeks
and then every 4 weeks for 16 weeks (standard labeling
dose of ofatumumab). The treatment arms were well

balanced, with 195 patients in the ibrutinib arm and 196
in the ofatumumab arm. The median age of the patients
in both arms was 67 years. The median number of prior
regimens was 3 in the ibrutinib arm compared with 2 in
the ofatumumab arm. Other baseline characteristics were
similar in both treatment arms, with approximately 50%
of patients being resistant to purine analogs and one-third
of patients had either a deletion of 17p or 11q. The OR
rate was 42.6% in the ibrutinib arm versus 4.1% in the
ofatumumab arm. The PFS was also significantly
improved in the ibrutinib arm, with the median not
reached at a median follow-up of 9.4 months on the ibrutinib arm and a median PFS duration of 8.1 months on
the ofatumumab arm. At 12 months, the OS rate was
90% in the ibrutinib arm and 81% in the ofatumumab
arm. Similar responses were noted among patients regardless of baseline characteristics. The most common nonhematologic toxicities encountered were diarrhea, fatigue,
pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib arm and fatigue,
infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab
arm. Adverse events of grade 3 that occurred more frequently in the ibrutinib arm versus the ofatumumab arm
included diarrhea (4% vs 2%) and atrial fibrillation (3%
vs 0%).

reported in 83 patients with recurrent/refractory CLL
with median age 67 years (range, 34 years-89 years) who
had received a median of 3 prior therapies (range, 1-12
prior therapies); 24% of the patients had a deletion of
17p, 22% had a deletion of 11q, and 34% of patients
were refractory to the last treatment.18 This study
included 4 dose levels with daily dosing as well as twicedaily dosing. No maximum tolerated dose was established
and a phase 2 dose expansion at 500 mg twice daily was
recommended. In 55 evaluable patients, the OR rate was
found to be 58% with a PR frequency of 40%. The median duration of treatment was 6 cycles (range, 0.2-21.6
cycles). The most common adverse events (occurring in
>10% of subjects) included diarrhea, fatigue, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, pyrexia, headache, cough,
upper respiratory infection, peripheral edema, abdominal
pain, dizziness, muscle spasms, contusion, anemia, pneumonia, sinusitis, and urinary tract infection. The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events included neutropenia
(21%), thrombocytopenia (15%), pneumonia (10%),
and anemia (8%). Additional studies with both of these
agents are currently ongoing. The question of whether
these agents or their side effect profiles will be better compared with ibrutinib remains to be answered.

Other BTK inhibitors

PI3K Inhibition

In addition to ibrutinib, there are several other small molecule inhibitors of BTK that have demonstrated promising clinical activity. Those that are furthest along in
clinical development include ONO-4059 and CC-292
(formerly AVL-292). A phase 1 study of ONO-4059 was
reported in 25 patients with recurrent or refractory highrisk CLL; doses ranged from 20 to 600 mg daily for up to
2 years and intrapatient dose escalation was permitted at
the time of completion of the first 6 months of treatment.17 The median age of the patients was 67 years
(range, 40 years-79 years), with a median of 4 prior therapies (range, 2-8 prior therapies); 8 of 22 patients (36%)
had deletion of 17p and 6 of 22 patients (27%) had deletion of 11q. The OR rate was noted to be 90% in 21 of 25
evaluable patients, with 14 PRs and 5 PRs with lymphocytosis. The median duration of treatment was 270 days
(range, 1-540 days), with 22 of the 25 patients remaining
on treatment. There was no evidence of a dose-efficacy
relationship noted at the time of last follow-up. The majority of low-grade adverse events included diarrhea, fatigue, bruising, and rash with no dose-limiting toxicities
noted. Five patients experienced grade 3/4 neutropenia.
Grade 3 nonhematologic events included pyrexia and
back pain. Similarly, a phase 1 study of CC-292 was

Idelalisib

Cancer

June 15, 2015

Idelalisib is the second furthest in clinical development
and was also approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in July 2014 as therapy for patients with previously treated CLL when used in combination with
rituximab. It is a potent, oral, selective inhibitor of PI3K
delta isoform (PI3Kd). The delta isoform is highly
expressed in lymphoid cells and believed to be one of the
critical isoforms involved in the malignant phenotype in
CLL. Similar to ibrutinib, it is believed to activate the
serine-threonine kinases AKT and mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) and exerts pleiotropic effects on cell
metabolism, migration, proliferation, survival, and differentiation as well as possibly exerting a role in other surface
receptors that impact CLL pathophysiology (such as C-XC chemokine receptor type 4 [CXCR4], CD40, and
CD49d).19-25
In a phase 1 study exploring single-agent idelalisib
administered at doses ranging from 50 mg to 350 mg
(daily or twice-daily administration) in 54 patients with
recurrent/refractory CLL, there were no dose-limiting
toxicities noted.26 The median age of the patients in the
study was 63 years (range, 37 years-82 years) and subjects
were heavily pretreated with a median of 5 prior therapies
1921

(range, 2-14 prior therapies), bulky lymphadenopathy
(80%), refractory disease (70%), unmutated IgVH
(91%), deletion of 17p and/or TP53 mutations (24%),
and deletion of 11q (28%). Patients were treated at 6 dose
levels of oral idelalisib (range, 50-350 mg once or twice
daily) and remained on continuous therapy if deriving
clinical benefit. The OR rate was 72%, with 39 of 54
patients achieving a PR and 33% of patients (18 of 54
patients) achieving a PR with lymphocytosis. The median
duration of response was 16.2 months, the median PFS
for all subjects was 15.8 months, and the median OS was
not reached with 75% of patients surviving at 36 months.
The median PFS for the 28 patients treated at the dose of
150 mg twice daily (the now recommended dose) was
32 months compared with 7 months for the 26 patients
treated at lower doses. The most common adverse events
of any grade included fatigue (31%), diarrhea (30%), pyrexia (28%), rash (22%), upper respiratory infections
(22%), and pneumonia (22%), with the most common
grade 3 toxicities noted for fatigue (2%), diarrhea (6%),
pyrexia (4%), and pneumonia (20%).
Another phase 1 study of idelalisib given continuously at a dose of 150 mg orally twice daily in combination with rituximab (at a dose of 375 mg/m2 every week
for 8 weeks), bendamustine (at a dose of 70 or 90 mg/m2
32 and every 4 weeks 36), or the combination of bendamustine and rituximab (every 4 weeks 36) was reported
at the same time in patients with recurrent/refractory
CLL.27 Patients still receiving treatment after 48 weeks
were eligible to continue idelalisib on an extension study.
A total of 52 patients with a median age of 64 years (range,
41 years-87 years) were enrolled and disease characteristics
included bulky lymphadenopathy (62%), refractory disease (50%), and a median of 3 prior therapies received
(range, 1-14 prior therapies), with 96% of patients having
received prior rituximab and 44% having received prior
bendamustine. The OR rate was 81% with 1 CR. The
median time to response was 1.9 months and the 2-year
PFS and OS rates were 62% and 85%, respectively. The
median duration of treatment was 18 months, with 60%
of patients having been enrolled into the extension study.
The most common adverse events of any grade were pyrexia (44%), diarrhea (40%), cough (31%), fatigue (29%),
nausea (29%), and pneumonia (15%). Grade 3 events
included pyrexia (6%), diarrhea (14%), pneumonia
(12%), and transaminase elevation (10%).
Recently, a phase 3 study of idelalisib plus rituximab
versus placebo plus rituximab in patients with recurrent
CLL who were unable to undergo chemotherapy either
due to decreased renal function, prior therapy-induced
1922

myelosuppression, or major coexisting illnesses was
reported by Furman et al.28 The study was stopped early
due to favorable results observed in the rituximab plus idelalisib arm. All 220 patients were randomized to receive
either rituximab (at a dose of 375 mg/m2 initially followed by a dose of 500 mg/m2 every 2 weeks for 4 doses
and then every 4 weeks for 3 doses, for a total of 8 infusions) plus oral idelalisib (at a dose of 150 mg twice daily)
or rituximab (at the same schedule) plus placebo twice
daily. The arms were well balanced and baseline characteristics included 78% of patients being aged 65 years (median age in both arms was 71 years) with a median of 3
prior regimens received. Approximately 40% of patients
had moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance
<60 mL/minute), 35% had poor bone marrow function
(grade 3 anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia),
85% had a Cumulative Illness Rating Scale of 6 (median
Cumulative Illness Rating Scale of 8 in each treatment
arm), >80% had unmutated IgVH, and .40% had deletion of chromosome 17p or TP53 mutations. At the time
of the reported analysis, the median duration of treatment
with the study drug was short at 3.8 months (range, 0.3 to
16 months) and was 2.9 months (range, 0.1-14.6
months) in the placebo arm. At the time of study termination, 81% of patients in the idelalisib arm were still receiving the study drug compared with only 52% of patients in
the placebo group. The most common reason for discontinuation of the study treatment was disease progression
(12 patients in the idelalisib arm vs 53 patients in the placebo arm). The median PFS duration was not reached in
the idelalisib arm but was 5.5 months in the placebo arm.
Responses were favorable among all patients in the idelalisib plus rituximab arm regardless of unfavorable characteristics such as 17p deletion, TP53 mutations, or IgVH
mutational status. The OR rate was evaluated for 176
patients (88 patients in each arm) at the time of the analysis (81% in the idelalisib plus rituximab arm vs 13% in
the placebo plus rituximab arm). All responses were PRs.
The OS rate among the patients receiving idelalisib plus
rituximab was 92% versus 80% among the patients receiving placebo plus rituximab at 12 months (P 5 .02). The
median duration of OS in the 2 groups has not yet been
reached at the time of last follow-up, although 16 patients
had died (4 patients [4%] in the idelalisib plus rituximab
arm vs 12 patients [11%] in the placebo plus rituximab
group). There was no overall difference in the rate of
adverse events with the addition of idelalisib to rituximab
compared with the combination of placebo and rituximab. The most common adverse events noted among the
patients in the idelalisib plus rituximab arm were pyrexia,

fatigue, nausea, chills, and diarrhea, with grade 3 events
noted in 4 patients with diarrhea and 2 patients with rash.
Grade 3 transaminase elevation was noted in 6 patients
(5%) in the idelalisib plus rituximab arm but this did not
lead to study discontinuation. The most common adverse
events noted in the patients treated on the placebo plus
rituximab arm was infusion-related reactions, fatigue,
cough, nausea, and dyspnea. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy were reported in 9 patients (8%)
in the idelalisib plus rituximab arm, 6 of which were characterized as gastrointestinal and skin disorders, and in 11
patients (10%) in the placebo plus rituximab arm; these
included infections and respiratory disorders in 8
patients.28
Other PI3K inhibitors

In addition to idelalisib, there are other PI3K molecules
currently in development. IPI-145 is an oral, potent PI3Kd, c inhibitor. Flinn et al reported a phase 1 study of IPI145 in patients with hematologic malignancies that
included 44 patients with recurrent/refractory CLL.29 The
median age of the patients was 67 years (range, 51 years-82
years), with 33 patients (75%) having received 3 prior
therapies. A total of 32 patients (73%) had TP53 mutations
and/or 17p deletion. Twenty-three patients received
25mg twice daily (median number of cycles, 5.6 [range,
1-21 cycles]) and 21 patients received a dose of 75 mg twice
daily (median number of cycles, 3.6 [range, 1-6 cycles]).
Clinical activity was observed, with an OR rate frequency
of 52% with 1 CR and 15 PRs. The most common grade
3 adverse events were neutropenia (20%), anemia (9%),
febrile neutropenia (7%), pneumonitis (7%), and transaminase elevation (5%). The most frequent adverse events were
respiratory and/or infectious events, which were reported to
occur in 11 patients (25%).
Syk Inhibition

Syk is another protein tyrosine kinase that when activated
phosphorylates several intermediates such as BTK that
then affect several downstream signaling pathways responsible for cell survival and proliferation. Previous in vitro
studies as well as an earlier clinical trial of what to the
authors’ knowledge was the first clinical trial of Syk inhibitor R406 (fostamatinib or R788) in humans reported
that disrupting this signaling lead to clinical activity.30,31
Friedberg et al reported a phase 1/2 study in patients with
recurrent B-cell malignancies that included 11 patients
with CLL who had the highest response rate (55%).32
However, R406 was found to have limited specificity toCancer

ward Syk and also displayed activity against other
kinases.33
GS-9973

Most recently, Sharman et al reported on a phase 2 trial
of GS-9973 in patients with previously treated CLL or
lymphoma.34 GS-9973 is an orally bioavailable selective
inhibitor of Syk. All patients were treated with GS-9973
at a dose of 800 mg twice daily. All patients with CLL/
SLL received a median of 2 prior regimens; 100% of
patients received an anti-CD20 antibody, 89% had
received an alkylating agent (59% received bendamustine), and 72% had received fludarabine. Results indicated that among patients with CLL who received at least
8 weeks of GS-9973 monotherapy, 97% (28 of 29
patients) experienced a reduction in lymph node size. Of
the 29 patients, 20 (69%) included in the efficacy analysis achieved >50% tumor shrinkage, including 4 of 7
patients with a chromosome 17p deletion and/or a mutation in the TP53 gene. The safety analysis included 78
patients with CLL and lymphoma who completed at
least 4 weeks of treatment. Overall, GS-9973 was well
tolerated. Fatigue of grade 3 was reported in 5 patients
(6%), and reversible grade 3 transaminase elevations
were reported in 9 patients (12%). In addition, 11
patients (14%) discontinued treatment because of
adverse events. Of the 78 patients in the study, 4 patients
died during the study period: 3 patients died of progressive disease and 1 patient died of septic shock.
Bcl-2 Inhibition

The Bcl-2 family of regulatory proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and
Mcl-1) regulate apoptosis by either inducing it (proapoptotic) or inhibiting it (antiapoptotic).35,36 Overexpression
of antiapoptotic genes and underexpression of proapoptotic
genes can result in the lack of cell death that is often characteristic of various cancers. Bcl-2 is considered an important
antiapoptotic protein and damage to the Bcl-2 gene has
been identified as a cause of several cancers as well as a cause
of resistance to cancer treatments.37-39 Inhibiting prosurvival proteins became a therapeutic strategy, with several
Bcl-2 inhibitors having been tested to date. One example,
Navitoclax, a selective inhibitor of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL,
was noted to have some clinical efficacy; however, its use
was limited due to the concomitant on-target thrombocytopenia caused by inhibition of Bcl-xL.40

Review Article

ABT-199, with decreased affinity to Bcl-xL has resulted
in decreased toxicity to platelets. In earlier studies,
ABT-199 demonstrated encouraging clinical activity
but an increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome was
noted that required dose modifications for careful
monitoring during dose escalation. Seymour et al
recently reported results from a phase 1, open-label,
dose escalation study in 67 patients with CLL/SLL.41
The initial dosing schema was initiated at a 50-mg
dose of ABT-199 during week 1, followed by a 2-step
dose escalation. During the second dose escalation
from 150 mg to 1200 mg, there was 1 death attributed
to tumor lysis syndrome. The study was temporarily
suspended and a more conservative 3-step dose escalation (starting with a 20-mg test dose on day 1 with
escalation allowed only in the absence of biochemical
tumor lysis) was performed along with enhanced prophylactic measures. Of the 67 patients in the study,
the median age was 67 years (range, 36 years-86 years).
Patients were heavily pretreated with a median of 4
prior therapies (range, 1-11 prior therapies), with 52%
of patients having disease that was refractory to prior
fludarabine. Of the 52 patients whose cytogenetics was
analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, 37%
had a deletion of chromosome 17p. At the time of last
follow-up, 43 patients remained on the study and were
continuing to receive active drug therapy. The median
time on study was 10.9 months. As evaluated by computed tomography imaging, 88% of patients (50 of 57
patients) had at least a 50% reduction in lymphadenopathy, with a median time to achieve a 50% reduction of 6 weeks (the time of the first CT scan as
stipulated per protocol). Approximately 89% of
patients (33 of 37 patients) had at least a 50% reduction in bone marrow infiltrate at the time of first bone
marrow biopsy at week 24. The median time to a
50% reduction in the peripheral blood lymphocyte
count (for those patients with a lymphocyte count >5
at baseline) was rapid at 15 days. The OR rate among
all currently evaluable patients was 84%, including a
CR rate of 23%. The OR rate among patients with
deletion of chromosome 17p was 82% and that among
those with fludarabine-refractory disease was 89%. Serious adverse events attributed to ABT-199 included 3
cases of febrile neutropenia and 3 cases of tumor lysis
syndrome, all of which occurred before the most recent
modification of the dosing schedule. Reasons for discontinuation were progressive disease in 14 patients,
adverse events in 8 patients, allogeneic transplant in 1
patient, and other reasons in1 patient.

Future Directions

To date, a major focus of the treatment of CLL has been
on the development of traditional chemoimmunotherapy
with the goal of achieving complete remission.
With the advent of many of these new small molecules, there is much excitement and yet much to consider.
It has become clear that many of these new agents are
enhancing the management of patients with CLL because
they significantly reduce the bulk of disease and offer disease control. However, only a few patients will achieve
complete remission with these agents when used alone.
There are many current clinical trials examining the combination of these agents with standard chemoimmunotherapy
regimens or antibody therapies to assess whether the addition of these agents to standard chemoimmunotherapy programs will increase the frequency of CRs or even further
deepen responses to achieve true minimal residual disease
(MRD) negativity. Another very important question will be
the ultimate timing and duration of therapy with many of
these new oral agents and possible potential toxicities with
their long-term use. It is foreseeable that in older, frailer
patients, either the use of these agents as monotherapy or in
combination with a monoclonal antibody might replace
more traditional approaches. In younger patients in whom
traditional chemoimmunotherapy is still actively being
used, it will be important to assess whether the addition of
these new agents to chemoimmunotherapy will increase the
frequency of CR and thereby increase the frequency of
MRD (ie MRD negativity) because it has been shown by
several groups that those patients who achieve a CR and are
MRD negative have longer PFS and OS.42-44 Other valid
considerations for evaluation in future clinical trials include:
whether patients who achieve a CR with MRD negativity
can be given a “drug holiday” and then have the drugs be
reinitiated at the first detection of recurrent disease, whether
long-term maintenance of some of these therapies will
become a new standard of care for patients with CLL (ie
for older, frailer patients), and whether there will be a role
for sequencing or combining some of these novel therapies
without considerable toxicity. As more experience with
these agents becomes available, consideration of which
agent to use compared with another may in part be based
on side effects, depending on the patient and their coexisting comorbidities and any additional knowledge gained
about response duration, PFS, and whether these patients
can be salvaged by other agents once they develop disease
progression (ie, the development of resistant mutations,
etc). In addition, another serious issue will be the longterm pharmacoeconomic implications of continuous
therapy.

Small Molecules in CLL/Lamanna

Conclusions

This is an exciting time in the treatment of patients with
CLL, but as these new agents have reinvigorated the treatment of this chronic disease, there are many new questions
that have arisen as well. Clinical investigation in CLL has
matured, with a growing number of opportunities to develop and investigate a variety of new therapies and
approaches. This review only discussed some of the new
molecules that are currently either approved or in additional clinical trial development that target some of the
BCR-associated kinases (such as BTK, PI3K, and Syk) as
well as inhibitors of Bcl-2. To our knowledge, these represent only a few of the many new agents that are currently
being evaluated in the pipeline and we await more data to
come. However, because it is yet uncertain how to best
use all these new therapies, clinicians should still be
encouraged to offer therapy to patients, preferably in the
setting of a clinical trial as we work through some of the
important issues raised. Hopefully, continued efforts to
develop new agents and strategies will ultimately lead to
the cure of this disease.
