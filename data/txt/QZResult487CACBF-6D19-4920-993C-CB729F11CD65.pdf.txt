Abstract
Although dendritic cell (DC) vaccines offer promise as cancer immunotherapy, further improvements are
needed to amplify their clinical therapeutic efﬁcacy. The pattern recognition scavenger receptor SRA/CD204
attenuates the ability of DCs to activate CD8þ T-cell responses. Therefore, we examined the impact of SRA/CD204
on antitumor responses generated by DC vaccines and we also evaluated the feasibility of enhancing DC vaccine
potency by SRA/CD204 blockade. DCs from SRA/CD204-deﬁcient mice were more immunogenic in generating
antitumor responses to B16 melanoma, compared with DCs from wild-type mice. Similarly, siRNA-mediated
knockdown of SRA/CD204 by lentiviral vectors improved the ability of wild-type DCs to stimulate the expansion
and activation of CD8þ T cells speciﬁc for idealized or established melanoma antigens in mice. Using SRA/CD204silenced DCs to generate antigen-targeted vaccines, we documented a marked increase in the level of antitumor
immunity achieved against established B16 tumors and metastases. This increase was associated with enhanced
activation of antigen speciﬁc CTLs, greater tumor inﬁltration by CD8þ T cells and NK cells, and increased
intratumoral ratios of both CD4þ and CD8þ T-effector cells to CD4þCD25þ T-regulatory cells. Our studies
establish that downregulating SRA/CD204 strongly enhances DC-mediated antitumor immunity. In addition,
they provide a rationale to enhance DC vaccine potency through SRA/CD204-targeting approaches that can
improve clinical outcomes in cancer treatment. Cancer Res; 71(21); 6611–20. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer immunotherapy aims to achieve immune-mediated
control of tumor growth by priming T-cell responses to target
tumor-associated antigens. Dendritic cells (DC) are the most
potent and highly specialized antigen-presenting cells (APC)
capable of inducing immune responses to self- or foreignantigens (1). DC-based vaccines represent a promising
approach for harnessing the patient's own immune system to
eliminate cancer cells (2). Encouraging clinical outcomes have
led to approval of the ﬁrst DC cancer vaccine, Sipuleucel-T
(APC8015), by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (3).
Although active immunization with DCs holds promise for
cancer immunotherapy, the limited success thus far in the

clinic indicates that improvements are necessary to provide
more beneﬁts to cancer patients. One of major efforts to
enhance DC vaccine potency has been focused on promoting
DC maturation and costimulation as a means of enhancing
antitumor immunity (2). Many aspects of positive signaling in
the generation of effective immunity have been reported.
However, information remains limited on the counterbalancing inhibitory pathways in DCs that can dampen induction of
immunity against tumor-associated self-antigens (4, 5). Knowledge of these immunosuppressive regulators could be
exploited therapeutically to enhance DC vaccine efﬁcacy.
Scavenger receptor SRA/CD204 is expressed primarily on
myeloid cells, including DCs, and functions as an innate
pattern recognition receptor (6). In addition to the established
roles that SRA/CD204 plays in lipid metabolism, atherosclerosis, and pathogen recognition (7, 8), our recent studies
suggest that SRA/CD204 serves as a suppressor of vaccineinduced antitumor immunity (9). In addition, SRA/CD204
attenuates a CD8þ T-cell response elicited by an immunostimulatory adjuvant targeting the toll-like receptor (TLR) 4
signaling (10). The increased CD8þ T-cell activation was
attributed to the enhanced DC functions upon inﬂammatory
stimulation [e.g., lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] in the absence of
SRA/CD204 (10). Several lines of evidence support the involvement of SRA/CD204 in restricting or limiting inﬂammatory
responses (11–13). Our recent studies uncovered a novel
molecular mechanism underlying the SRA/CD204-mediated

Materials and Methods
Mice and cell lines
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the NIH (Bethesda,
MD). SRA/CD204 knockout mice (SRA/), Pmel transgenic
mice, and OT-I mice (17) were purchased from the Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All experimental procedures
were conducted according to the protocols approved by the
VCU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Reagents and antibodies
Recombinant gp100 protein was prepared using a BacPAK
baculovirous expression system (BD Biosciences) as previously
described (18). OVA257–264 (SIINFEKL) and gp10025–33
(KVPRNQDWL) peptides were purchased from AnaSpec Inc.
Mouse monoclonal antibodies to CD4 (GK1.5), CD8a (53-6.7),
CD3 (HL3), IFN-g (XMG1.2), CD25 (PC61), CD90.1 (OX-7),
isotype control rat IgG2b (RTK4530), and IgG1 (RTK2071)
were purchased from BioLegend. SRA/CD204 polyclonal antibodies and mAb (2F8) were purchased from R&D Systems and
AbD Serotec, respectively.
Lentivirus-mediated gene silencing
Bone marrow-derived DCs (BM-DCs) were generated from
bone marrow cells with mouse GM-CSF (Peprotech Inc.) as
previously described (10). Lentiviruses encoding mouse SRA/
CD204 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or scramble shRNA were
packaged using Phoenix cells cotransfected with pLKO.1 constructs and pMD.G and pCMVDR8.91. Viruses were collected
and concentrated using ultracentrifugation. Day 3 BM-DCs or
DC progenitors were infected with lentiviruses in the presence
of 4 mg/mL polybrene and 20 ng/mL GM-CSF. Culture media
were replaced with GM-CSF–containing media on days 4 and 6.
On day 8, the infected BM-DCs were analyzed for SRA/CD204
knockdown efﬁciency and used for studies.

In vitro stimulation of T cells
DCs were pulsed with OVA (10 mg/mL) or gp100 protein
(25 mg/mL) for 2 hours, followed by stimulation with LPS (500
ng/mL) for additional 2 hours. DCs were washed and incubated
with 1  105 OT-I cells or Pmel cells. T-cell proliferation was
measured based on 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR) incorporation.
Culture supernatant was collected 48 hours later and analyzed
for cytokine levels using ELISA.
Immunization and T-cell functional assays
Mice were vaccinated subcutaneously twice at weekly intervals with antigen-loaded DCs with ex vivo LPS stimulation for 2
hours before immunization. For intracellular IFN-g staining,
lymphoid cells were stimulated with OVA257–264 or gp10025–33
peptide (1 mg/mL) at 37 C for 72 hours. After treatment with
PMA (10 nmol/L) plus ionomycin (1 mmol/L) in the presence of
brefeldin A (5 mg/mL) for 5 hours, cells were stained with
ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD8 antibodies
and subsequently permeabilized using a Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm
kit (BD Biosciences). The cells were then stained with PEconjugated anti–IFN-g antibodies and analyzed using ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) by gating on CD8þ T cells.
ELISPOT was done 48 hours after cell stimulation with CTL
epitopes as previously described (10). In vivo CTL assays were
done using peptide-loaded CFSEhigh splenocytes as targets
(10). For some experiments, splenocytes were stimulated with
OVA257–264 in the presence of IL-2 for 5 days and used as
effector cells in a standard chromium release assay.
Adoptive T-cell transfer
A total of 5  106 Pmel cells or CFSE-labeled OT-I cells were
transferred intravenously into recipient mice, followed by DC
immunization subcutaneously next day. Cells from the spleen
and draining lymph nodes were harvested 5 days later, and
stained with anti-CD8 and anti-CD90.1 antibodies. Cells were
gated on CD8þCD90.1þ (for Pmel cells) or CD8þCFSEþ (for
OT-I cells).

downregulation of TLR4 signaling in DCs and activation of
transcription factor NF-kB, a master regulator of immunity
(14). Given that engagement of TLR signaling pathways in DCs
is a promising mechanism for boosting vaccine responses (15),
sequestering the suppressors of TLRs could potentially promote the stimulatory capability of DCs in mobilization of CTLs
and antitumor immunity.
Self-inactivating lentiviral system has been shown to be a
safe and efﬁcient vehicle for genetic modiﬁcation of DCs and
has considerable potential for clinical applications (16). In
this study, we sought to examine the impact of SRA/CD204
on DC vaccine-induced immune activation and the feasibility of disabling SRA/CD204 by lentivirus-mediated silencing
to improve the antitumor potency of DC vaccine. We show
that SRA/CD204-silenced DCs are highly effective in promoting functional activation of CTLs and antitumor immunity
against the poorly immunogenic B16 melanoma and metastases. Our studies reveal the profound effects of SRA/CD204
downregulation on DC vaccine-augmented antitumor
immune responses and show the principle of silencing
SRA/CD204 as a means to break tolerance against tumorassociated self-antigens.

were inoculated s.c. with 5  105 B16-OVA tumor cells. In
therapeutic studies, mice were established with tumors by
injecting B16-gp100 cells on day 0. Tumor-bearing mice were
treated subcutaneously with DC vaccines on days 4, 7, and 10.
CD8þ or CD4þ T cells were depleted using 2.43 or GK1.5
monoclonal antibodies, respectively (9). For analysis of
tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL), tumors were digested

SRA/CD204 silencing enhances the capability of DCs to
activate OVA-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells
Self-inactivating lentiviral vectors (LV) encoding shRNA
were used for SRA/CD204 silencing in DCs because of their
safety and superior transduction efﬁciency in primary cells
(19). We initially screened several shRNAs targeting different
sequences of SRA/CD204 and identiﬁed SRA shRNA #3 (hairpin sequence CCGGGCAGTTCAGAATCCGTGAAATCTCGAGATTTCACGGATTCTGAACTGCTTTTTG) capable of efﬁciently downregulating SRA/CD204 (Fig. 2A). We found that
lentiviral infection of early BM-DC cultures (i.e., day 3 BM-DC)
resulted in a better transduction efﬁciency and reduced virusassociated toxicity without affecting DC differentiation or
functions (data not shown). The protein levels of SRA/CD204
expression in DCs infected with LV-SRA shRNA was reduced by
approximately 90% compared with cells untreated or infected
with LV-scrambled shRNA (Fig. 2B). The lentiviral infection of
DCs did not seem to induce activation of the type I interferon
(e.g., IFN-b) response pathway under the conditions tested
(Fig. 2C), which permits more reliable study of the immunologic effect of SRA/CD204 silencing in DCs. We next examined
whether SRA/CD204 silencing rendered DCs more responsive
to LPS stimulation as previously shown in SRA-deﬁcient DCs.
As expected, SRA/CD204-silenced DCs displayed higher transcription levels of inﬂammatory genes, including tnf-a, il-6, and
ip10, compared with scrambled shRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2D).
DCs transduced with scrambled shRNA (DC-Scram) or LVSRA/CD204 shRNA (DC-SRA shRNA) were pulsed with OVA

Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences). Tumor tissues were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and slides were
scanned with the Ariol SL-50 automated scanning system
(Genetix Ltd.).
Statistical analysis
The data are expressed as the mean values  SE. Comparisons between 2 groups were done using Student t test.
Comparisons between multiple groups were carried out using
ANOVA test. A value of P < 0.05 is considered to be statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
Vaccination with SRA/CD204-deﬁcient DCs induces an
enhanced antitumor response
We previously showed that DCs lacking SRA/CD204 upon
TLR4 stimulation were more efﬁcient than wild-type (WT)
counterparts in activating OVA-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells (10). To
examine whether the enhanced CD8þ T-cell activity could lead
to improved tumor protective immunity, we initially used the
well-deﬁned B16 melanoma model, which expresses the cytosolic form of the model antigen OVA. Although mice receiving
WT DC vaccines showed modest inhibition of tumor growth
compared with untreated mice, mice vaccinated with SRA/
DCs developed a robust antitumor response (Fig. 1), suggesting
enhanced immunogenicity of DCs in the absence of SRA/
CD204 in the context of DC vaccine therapy.

protein and stimulated with LPS. The genetically modiﬁed DCs
were cocultured with na€ve OT-I cells that speciﬁcally recognize H2Kb-restricted OVA257–264. DC-SRA shRNA induced
much stronger proliferation (Fig. 2E) and IFN-g production
(Fig. 2F) of OT-I cells than did DC-Scram. We used adoptive
T-cell transfer assays to examine the capability of SRA/CD204silenced DCs to activate naive OT-I cells in vivo. Expansion of
OT-I cells was greatly enhanced in mice immunized with DCSRA shRNA compared with those immunized with DC-Scram
(Fig. 2G).
We further examined the effector function of OVA-speciﬁc
CD8þ T cells using ELISPOT assays. Mice immunized with
SRA/CD204-silenced DCs showed a signiﬁcant increase in IFNg-producing CD8þ T cells than those immunized with DCScram in the spleen and lymph nodes (Fig. 3A). Compared with
DC-Scram immunized mice, mice immunized with DC-SRA
shRNA displayed enhanced cytotoxicity against antigen-positive targets (Fig. 3B), as indicated by increased killing of
OVA257–264 pulsed, CFSEhigh splenocytes (39% vs. 60% lysis in
the spleen and 40% vs. 71% lysis in the lymph nodes) observed
in an in vivo CTL assay. This result was consistent with
chromium release assays showing that splenocytes from mice
immunized with DC-SRA shRNA exhibited more potent cytolytic activities against B16-OVA cells (Fig. 3C).

adoptively transferred Pmel cells (i.e., CD8þCD90.1þ T cells)
showed greater expansion in mice vaccinated with SRA/
CD204-silenced DCs than in those receiving DC-Scram or

We evaluated the therapeutic efﬁcacy of the SRA/CD204silenced DCs after antigen loading and LPS stimulation in mice
with preestablished B16-gp100 tumors. Vaccination with DCScram showed little inhibitory effect on tumor growth and had
survival rates no better than those untreated mice. In contrast,
vaccine therapy using SRA/CD204-silenced DCs led to profound tumor suppression (Fig. 5C). Mice receiving SRA/CD204silenced DC vaccine did not show apparent toxicity and any
overt signs of gross pathology in their major organs. No
depigmentation (vitiligo) was observed in these mice (data
not shown). To determine the involvement of immune effector
cells in the tumor control mediated by SRA/CD204-silenced
DCs, we eliminated T-cell subsets in vivo using antibodies
(Fig. 5D). Depletion of CD8þ cells completely abrogated antitumor activities, whereas lack of CD4þ cells seemed to modestly improve the tumor suppression, suggesting a possible
inhibitory role for CD4þ Treg cells in this model (23).

Improved antitumor efﬁcacy by SRA/CD204 silencing in
DCs is associated with systemic immune activation in
B16 tumor-bearing mice
ELISPOT assays showed that splenocytes from mice treated
with SRA/CD204-silenced DCs, upon stimulation with gp10025–
33 peptide, produced much more IFN-g than those from DCScram vaccinated or untreated tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 6A).
The results were conﬁrmed using intracellular cytokine staining
assays (Fig. 6B). The percentage of IFN-g-secreting CD8þ T cells
in DC-SRA shRNA immunized mice showed 2.6-fold and 4.1-fold
increase in the spleen and tumor-draining lymph nodes, respectively, when compared with DC-Scram immunized mice (Fig.
6B). These results are consistent with earlier studies showing
immune-mediated suppression of B16 melanoma involving T
cells and IFN-g (24). We also conducted in vivo CTL assays by
transferring gp10025–33-pulsed CFSEþ splenocytes into tumorbearing mice that have received DC vaccine therapy. Mice

cytotoxicity against gp100-positive targets compared with
scramble DC-Scram–treated mice (Fig. 6C, 73% vs. 42% lysis in
the spleen and 82% vs. 51% lysis in the lymph nodes).
To provide more insights into the enhanced antitumor
response, we examined TILs in mice receiving vaccine therapies. Although there were few CD8þ T cells in untreated B16
tumors, SRA/CD204 silencing in DCs resulted in a substantial
increase in the percentage of CD8þ T cells and a modest
increase of NK cells (Fig. 6D). Treatment with either DC-Scram
or DC-SRA shRNA caused expansion and inﬁltration of CD4þ T
cells, including CD4þCD25þ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and
CD4þCD25 T cells, when compared with untreated tumorbearing mice. However, the percentage of Tregs in the TILs was

lower after treatment with DC-SRA shRNA than that following
treatment with DC-Scram (Fig. 6E). As a result, the ratio of
CD4þCD25 Tregs to CD4þCD25þ T cells dramatically
increased in the tumor compartment after therapy with
SRA/CD204-silenced DC vaccine (Fig. 6E). Similar result was
obtained when cells were stained with anti-CD4 and Foxp3
antibodies, as indicated by an increase in the ratios of
CD4þFoxp3 to CD4þFoxp3þ T cells (Fig. 6F).

of experimental lung metastasis. Mice were injected intravenously with B16-Luc cells 4 days prior to DC vaccine
therapy (Fig. 7A). Intense bioluminescence was seen in the
chest, abdomen, and head of untreated mice. Vaccine therapy with DC-Scram substantially reduced bioluminescence
in the chest and abdomen. Strikingly, bioluminescence was
almost undetectable in mice receiving DC-SRA shRNA, especially in the chest (Fig. 7B). The number of lung metastases
generally correlated with the bioluminescence intensity (Fig.
7C). The lungs from untreated mice showed numerous
pigmented tumor nodules, whereas less lung metastases
were seen in DC-Scram vaccine-treated mice. In contrast,
only few scattered tumor nodules of much smaller size were
evident in the lungs from mice treated with SRA/CD204silenced DCs (Fig. 7C). Histopathologic analysis conﬁrmed

Discussion
The presence of various intrinsic immune inhibitory molecules in DCs and associated counterbalancing machineries are
pivotal for maintaining immune homeostasis and minimizes
the likelihood of developing excessive immune responses (25).
However, it also creates a formidable barrier to the development of effective immunotherapies and cancer vaccines. In this
study, we have provided the ﬁrst evidence showing that genetic
modiﬁcation of DCs by silencing SRA/CD204, a negative
immune regulator, led to greatly improved DC vaccine potency
and tumor control.
Emerging evidence suggests that targeting intrinsic immune
inhibitory mechanisms in DCs, such as SOCS1 (suppressor of

Enhanced DC Vaccine Potency by CD204 Silencing

cytokine signaling 1; ref. 26) and A20 (5), can be exploited for
potentiating therapeutic immunity against cancer. These 2
molecules have been shown to play a role in negative regulation
of DC functions by controlling the JAK/STAT and TLR/NF-kB
pathways (4, 27). The signiﬁcance of TLR signaling in enhancing
antigen presentation and activating adaptive or acquired
immune responses has been well established. TLR-mediated
DC activation is a crucial step in this process (28). Interestingly,
we recently showed that SRA/CD204 was also capable of attenuating TLR4 signaling-induced NF-kB activation in DCs, resulting in enhanced expression of costimulatory molecules, proinﬂammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-12), and type I
interferons (e.g., IFN-b; refs. 10, 14). Using 2 different systems
involving a model antigen (i.e., OVA) and a clinically relevant
melanoma-associated antigen (i.e., gp100), we have shown that
DCs genetically modiﬁed with SRA/CD204-silencing lentiviruses
exhibit an enhanced capacity to stimulate an antigen-speciﬁc
CTL response. These results are consistent with our previous
observations of enhancement of TLR4 agonist-induced CD8þ Tcell immunity in SRA/ mice, which has been attributed to the
absence of SRA/CD204 in DCs (10). The robust CD8þ T-cell
response elicited by the lentivirally engineered DCs targeting
SRA/CD204 are required for effective suppression of preestablished B16 melanomas, indicating that the immunogenicity of
DCs and resultant antitumor efﬁcacy may be potentially
enhanced by downregulation or blockade of SRA/CD204.
In addition to the enhanced systemic CD8þ T-cell response,
the improved tumor control by the SRA/CD204-silenced DCs
was associated with profoundly increased inﬁltration of effector cells, including CD8þ T cells and NK cells, both of which
play important roles in immune-mediated eradication of
tumor cells. The presence of NK cells in the tumor site may
not be surprising because there is an increasing body of in vivo
evidence showing the activation of NK cells following DC
vaccine therapy (29, 30). Intriguingly, although total tumor
inﬁltrating CD4þ T cells increased in DC-Scram and DC-SRA
shRNA-treated mice, the levels of Tregs decreased signiﬁcantly
in the tumor compartment after vaccinations with SRA/
CD204-silenced DCs. It could be explained by the more significant expansion/recruitment of CD4þCD25 or CD4þFoxp3
T-cell population induced by SRA/CD204-silenced DCs. A
possible suppressive function of Tregs in the DC vaccinegenerated immunity against B16 tumors was implicated in
our antibody depletion study, which is also supported by the
previous work by Sutmuller and colleagues using the same
tumor model (23). As a result, the increased ratios of inﬁltrating
CD8þ and CD4þ Teffs to Tregs in the tumor compartment
could contribute to the enhanced antitumor efﬁcacy augmented by SRA/CD204-silenced DC vaccine, because the intratu-

moral balance of Teffs and Tregs has been shown to directly
correlate with tumor suppression (31). In addition, increased
cytokine (IL-6, TNF-a) production resulted from the engagement of TLRs on SRA/CD204-downregulated DCs may also
help overcome Treg-mediated immune suppression (5, 32). It
remains to be examined whether the reduction of SRA/CD204
expression promotes the resistance of DCs to Tregs-mediated
suppression as described in the study of A20-silenced DCs (5).
The recent approval of DC vaccine therapy has paved a path
for the development of next generation of DC-based immunotherapy (33). Our data indicate that silencing of SRA/CD204
results in DCs with enhanced stimulatory capacity in the
context of activation of antitumor immunity. Interestingly,
blockade of MARCO, another class A scavenger in DCs, was
recently shown to promote generation of tumor-reactive T
cells (34), suggesting that the action of individual scavenger
receptors in immune modulation needs to be deﬁned and may
be exploited for provoking therapeutic beneﬁts. Our study not
only sheds light on the under-appreciated regulatory functions
of SRA/CD204 in DC biology and immunology, but also offers
further insights into strategies for achieving enhanced antitumor immunity by targeting DC-intrinsic immunologic inhibitory molecules.
