Molecular basis underlying resistance to Mps1/TTK inhibitors
A Koch, A Maia, A Janssen1 and RH Medema
Mps1/TTK is a dual-speciﬁcity kinase, with an essential role in mitotic checkpoint signaling, which has emerged as a potential target
in cancer therapy. Several Mps1/TTK small-molecule inhibitors have been described that exhibit promising activity in cell culture and
xenograft models. Here, we investigated whether cancer cells can develop resistance to these drugs. To this end, we treated various
cancer cell lines with sublethal concentrations of a potent Mps1/TTK inhibitor in order to isolate inhibitor-resistant monoclonal cell
lines. We identiﬁed four point mutations in the catalytic domain of Mps1/TTK that gave rise to inhibitor resistance but retained wildtype catalytic activity. Interestingly, cross-resistance of the identiﬁed mutations to other Mps1/TTK inhibitors is limited. Our studies
predict that Mps1/TTK inhibitor-resistant tumor cells can arise through the acquisition of mutations in the adenosine triphosphatebinding pocket of the kinase that prevent stable binding of the inhibitors. In addition, our results suggest that combinations of
inhibitors could be used to prevent acquisition of drug resistance. Interestingly, cross-resistance seems nonspeciﬁc for inhibitor
scaffolds, a notion that can be exploited in future drug design to evict possible resistance mutations during clinical treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Mps1 (also known as TTK) is an essential dual-speciﬁcity kinase
that acts as an important guardian of the ﬁdelity of chromosome
segregation. Mps1 has an essential role in the mitotic
checkpoint,1–3 also referred to as the spindle assembly
checkpoint.4 An important factor in this regulation is its multiphosphorylation of the essential kinetochore component KNL1.5–7
Depletion of Mps1 results in mitotic checkpoint abrogation and
cell death within several rounds of cell division.8 Interestingly,
partial short hairpin RNA-based depletion of Mps1 results in
enhanced sensitivity to low doses of the microtubule targeting
chemotherapeutic paclitaxel (taxol) in human tumor cells, whereas
immortalized human ﬁbroblasts display less sensitivity to this
combination.8 Reducing Mps1 levels by RNA interference in cells
overexpressing Mps1 has been shown to be detrimental to
survival, but did not affect cell viability of isogenic untransformed
cells.9 These observations have drawn the attention of researchers
to Mps1 as a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy.
Several Mps1 small-molecule inhibitors have been described to
date (reviewed in Lan and Cleveland10 and Liu and Winey11).
These compounds often exhibit promising anti-proliferative
activity in human cancer cells because of the speciﬁc inhibition
of Mps1 kinase activity. Among these compounds, NMS-P715,
MPI-0479605, Mps-BAY2b and Mps1-IN-3 showed promising
results in pre-clinical studies with rodent xenograft models.12–15
Apart from these pre-clinical compounds, the small-molecule
Mps1 inhibitors reversine and AZ3146 have drawn attention as
important tools to decipher Mps1 functions in mitosis.10,16,17
The strategy of targeting kinases with small-molecule kinase
inhibitors in cancer therapy has been speciﬁcally successful to
treat cells overexpressing or containing hyperactivated alleles
of the tyrosine kinases BCR–ABL and
epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) (reviewed in Barouch-Bentov and
Sauer18). Although very successful, these treatments have also
unveiled that initial drug responses are frequently followed by the

acquisition of drug resistance with often complete unresponsiveness to the small-molecule inhibitors. Drug resistance can be due
to activation of bypass signaling pathways, but often arises as a
consequence of mutations in the targeted kinase that render it
insensitive to the inhibitors, leaving the overall activity relatively
unaffected. These mutations often occur in a speciﬁc residue of
the Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding pocket called the
‘gatekeeper’, so called because the size of the amino-acid side
chain at this position determines which nucleotides, ATP-analogs
or inhibitors can bind.19 For example, the EGFR mutation T790M
decrease the Km of the EGFR for ATP, thus increasing the catalytic
efﬁciency of the kinase. This in turn leads to a diminished relative
binding of the ATP-competitive inhibitors geﬁtinib and erlotinib
(reviewed in Chong and Janne20). In BCR–ABL1, the T315I
gatekeeper mutation eliminates a critical hydrogen bond for
inhibitor binding and creates a steric clash with the inhibitor
imatinib.21 Combining mutation analysis and structural biology
has allowed for the identiﬁcation of second-generation inhibitors
for BCR–ABL1 and EGFR. These latter inhibitors were designed to
speciﬁcally target only the gatekeeper-mutated form of the kinase
(reviewed in Chong and Janne20 and Weisberg et al.22). Thus, the
development of kinase inhibitors can beneﬁt from structural work
to guide improved selectivity and speciﬁcity of certain inhibitors.
Apart from the inhibitor resistance in tyrosine kinases like EGFR
and BCR–ABL1, kinase inhibitor resistance in serine–threonine
kinases has also been described recently. The essential mitotic
Aurora and Polo-like kinases have drawn attention as potential
therapeutic targets for clinical cancer therapy. Girdler et al.23 used
hypermutagenic colon cancer cells to identify mutations in Aurora
B to confer resistance to the inhibitor ZM447439. Wacker et al.24
identiﬁed mutations in PLK1 to confer resistance to the PLK
inhibitor BI2536 by using the same strategy. Interestingly, the
identiﬁed mutations in these kinases were not at the gatekeeper
position but located at other positions in the ATP-binding pocket
of these kinases. Similar mutations were described in a study of

Mps1/TTK inhibitor resistance
A Koch et al

Scutt et al.25 that used a computational crystallographic analysis to
identify drug-resistant mutations of Aurora A, B and PLK1.
Here we describe the identiﬁcation and characterization of a
variety of mutations in Mps1 that provoke resistance to smallmolecule inhibitors of Mps1. We identify four point mutations in
the catalytic kinase domain of Mps1 that give rise to various levels
of resistance. In addition, we provide evidence that an Mps1
mutation found in a human tumor sample confers resistance to
Mps1 inhibitors. We furthermore tested if the identiﬁed mutations
resulted in cross-resistance to different classes of Mps1 inhibitors.
We ﬁnd that the mutations confer resistance to only a subset of
inhibitors, providing important insights for future drug design to
prevent the development of resistance during drug therapy.
RESULTS
To determine whether human cancer cells can develop resistance
to Mps1 inhibitors, we aimed at identifying the most potent
compound to use for our selection procedure. The three cancer
cell lines HCT-116, DLD-1 and U2OS were exposed to increasing
concentrations of the known Mps1 inhibitors NMS-P715,12 MPI0479605,15 reversine17 and a derivative of NMS-P715, hereafter
referred to as compound-5 (Cpd-5)26 (Supplementary Figure 1).
The treatment with different inhibitors reduced cell viability in all
cases, nevertheless with different grades of sensitivity
(Supplementary Figures 2a-c). NMS-P715 shows the weakest
effects of all tested inhibitors with an IC50 higher than 150 nM
(Supplementary Figures 2a-c). Reversine and MPI-0479605
exhibit a slightly more potent effect with IC50 around 63 to 153 nM.

2519
Cpd-5 shows the strongest effect of the four tested inhibitors with
an IC50 of 20–25 nM (Supplementary Figures 2a-c). When used in
in vitro kinase assays using recombinant Mps1 kinase domain
(519–808 aa), Cpd-5 showed increased potency (IC50 of 5.8 nM)
compared with NMS-P715 (IC50 of 71.3 nM), suggesting that the
inhibitory effect on cell survival is because of the inhibition of
Mps1 (Supplementary Figure 2d). For further validation of Cpd-5
as an Mps1 inhibitor, we used HeLa cells expressing ﬂuorescently
tagged histone H2B (H2B-YFP). Cpd-5 inhibits the proliferation of
these HeLa cells with an IC50 of 28 nM (Supplementary Figure 3a).
In order to determine the effects of selective Mps1 inhibition by
Cpd-5 on mitotic checkpoint activity, we treated HeLa cells with
the microtubule poison nocodazole in the absence and presence
of Cpd-5 (Figure 1a). HeLa cells treated with nocodazole remained
arrested for 4720 min after nuclear envelope breakdown.
Simultaneous administration of 100 nM Cpd-5 led to mitotic exit
in 94% of the cells within 60 min after nuclear envelope
breakdown, indicating that Cpd-5 efﬁciently abrogates the mitotic
checkpoint at concentrations that effectively inhibit the kinase
activity of Mps1. In addition, Cpd-5 administration alone resulted
in a decrease in the time spent in mitosis with nearly 100% of
HeLa cells initiating anaphase within 15 min (50 and 100 nM Cpd-5)
as compared with 0% of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-treated cells
initiating anaphase in the same time frame (Figure 1b). The
average time spent in mitosis decreased from 52.3 min (±33.1 min)
in DMSO-treated cells to 16.7 (±2.6 min) in 50 nM and 15.7
(±2.3 min) in 100 nM Cpd-5-treated cells (Figure 1b). This
decreased timing was associated with an increase in the amount
of missegregating chromosomes from ~ 20% in DMSO-treated

cells to nearly 100% after 50 and 100 nM Cpd-5 administration
(Figure 1c). The severity of segregation errors was increased when
comparing 50 with 100 nM Cpd-5 (from 60% to 95%) although the
time spent in mitosis did not decrease further (16.7 min in 50 nM
compared with 15.7 min in 100 nM) (Figure 1c). Furthermore, we
tested the ability of Cpd-5 to prevent the Mps1-speciﬁc
phosphorylation of the MELT repeats in the kinetochore protein
KNL1.6,7 Administration of 50 and 100 nM completely depleted the
level of phosphorylated KNL1 at kinetochores (Figures 1d and e).
These data indicate that Cpd-5 administration leads to cell death
because of the increase in missegregations as a result of
abrogated mitotic checkpoint and improper chromosome alignments, a phenotype previously described for knockdown as well
as chemical inhibition of Mps1 (reviewed in Liu and Winey11).

in these mitotic checkpoint assays, with the C604Y mutation being
most resistant to Cpd-5. Unfortunately, in our hands, HeLa cells
were not suitable for this ﬁxed cell-based assay and therefore we
performed live cell imaging to determine if the I598F mutation
also sustains mitotic checkpoint function in the presence of Cpd-5.
Nocodazole caused both the HeLa and HeLa-I598F cells to arrest in
mitosis for 41200 min (Figure 3b). Cpd-5 administration led to a
signiﬁcant decrease in average mitotic timing in HeLa cells, but
HeLa-I598F cells were more refractory to checkpoint inactivation
by Cpd-5 (Figure 3b). Complete checkpoint override was seen at
100 nM Cpd-5 in HeLa versus 200 nM Cpd-5 in its mutated
counterpart (Figure 3b). This twofold difference in sensitivity is
in agreement with the observed increase of IC50 determined in the
viability assays (Figure 2c).

Cells acquire resistance to Cpd-5 through selective mutation of
Mps1
Having established Cpd-5 as a bona ﬁde Mps1 inhibitor, we next
determined if human cancer cells could develop resistance to
Cpd-5. To this end, we made use of mismatch repair-deﬁcient
(and therefore hypermutagenic) colorectal cancer cell lines
HCT-116 and DLD-1,27 as well as chromosome instable cell
lines U2OS and HeLa. This strategy has been previously used
successfully with HCT-116 cells to obtain resistant cell lines against
the Aurora B inhibitor ZM447439.23
All cell lines were treated with lethal concentrations of Cpd-5
(up to 50 nM) over a period of 3 weeks. After treatment, we
obtained nine independent HCT-116, four independent HeLa and
one DLD-1 Cpd-5-resistant cell lines. These 14 cell lines were
tested in a colony formation assay, and three HCT-clones,
one DLD-1 clone and one HeLa-clone showed survival upon
administration of 60 nM Cpd-5, whereas the wild-type counterparts
were not able to survive at this concentration (Figure 2a).
Sequencing of Mps1 complementary DNAs (cDNAs) derived from
these clones revealed that these had acquired mutations in the
Mps1 gene (Figure 2b). All of the identiﬁed mutations map to the
highly conserved kinase domain of Mps1 (Supplementary Figure 4).
Besides the cell lines that contained mutations in Mps1, we also
identiﬁed cell lines without mutations that were partially resistant
to Cpd-5. This points to possible mechanisms of resistance that do
not involve mutations in Mps1 that will require further study.
Nonetheless, these data show that cells can acquire resistance to
Mps1 inhibitors via mutations in the Mps1 kinase domain.
Next, we sought to determine the IC50 of Cpd-5 in the mutant
cell lines (Figure 2c). HCT-I531M had a 10.2x higher IC50 than
HCT-116 control cells. The two HCT-C604Y cell lines exhibited
an even higher tolerance rate for Cpd-5 with an 18.8x and
18.1x higher IC50 for Cpd-5 than the HCT-116 counterpart. The
homozygous S611R mutation in DLD-1 cells exhibited a 10x higher
IC50 for Cpd-5 than DLD-1 cells. The homozygous I598F mutation
showed the weakest increase in IC50 change of all mutants with
only a 2.6x higher tolerance for Cpd-5 (Figure 2c, Supplementary
Figure 5). Western blot analysis of Mps1 protein levels indicated
that the mutations do not inﬂuence the stability or expression of
Mps1 (Supplementary Figure 6a).

In vitro activity of Mps1 mutants
To determine the effect of the mutations on the catalytic activity
of Mps1, we performed in vitro kinase assays with recombinant
kinase domain of mutated and non-mutated Mps1 using KNL1 as
a substrate.28 All mutated kinases showed increased resistance to
Cpd-5 in vitro with the C604Y displaying most resistance, the
S611R displaying only minor resistance (Supplementary Figure 7).
At 400 nM, only Mps1-C604Y retained kinase activity with only a
40% reduction in target phosphorylation. Thus, these mutations
render Mps1 more resistant to Cpd-5, but they can be inhibited at
higher doses. As the total level of KNL1 phosphorylation was
similar among the mutant forms, we conclude that the mutants
are not hyperactive, but likely have reduced afﬁnity for Cpd-5
when compared with the wild-type counterpart (Supplementary
Figure 7).

Mutated Mps1 variants confer resistance to Cpd-5
As an alternative measure for the effect of Cpd-5 on mutated
Mps1, we asked whether the mutant cell lines arrest in mitosis in a
mitotic checkpoint-dependent manner in the presence of high
doses of Cpd-5. Although the relative mitotic indexes of parental
HCT-116, and DLD-1 control cells dropped by 60% and 70% after
16-h treatment with 30 nM Cpd-5 and nocodazole (microtubule
destabilizing drug), the mutant counterparts DLD-1-S611R,
HCT-I531M and both HCT-C604Y were still in mitosis at higher
concentrations of Cpd-5 (200 and 400 nM) (Figure 3a). Thus, the
trend seen in the colony formation assays (Figure 2c) was mirrored

Modeling of mutations in the Mps1 crystal structure
Next, we modeled the identiﬁed mutations into the crystal
structure of the Mps1 kinase domain, complexed to NMS-P715.12
I531M, C604Y and S611R are located in the ATP-binding pocket,
whereas I598F is located further away in the N-terminal lobe of the
kinase domain in an area called the hydrophobic spine29
(Figure 4a). I531 is located at the top of the ATP-binding pocket
and has hydrophobic stacking interactions with the phenyl-ring in
NMS-P715 (Figure 4a). Replacement with methionine in the I531M
mutation, although equally hydrophobic, is expected to disrupt
these interactions, although without inducing van der Waals
clashes with binding of NMS-P715. The situation is much more
marked with residue C604, which has interactions with the
triﬂuoro-methoxy group of NMS-P715 and the N18 nitrogen atom
that connects the NMS-P715 ring systems. These are disrupted by
replacement of C604 with a bulky phenyl group in the C604Y
mutation, which is expected to be incompatible with binding of
the triﬂuoro-methoxy group in NMS-P715 (Figure 4b). Finally,
residue S611 has no direct interactions with NMS-P715, but
maintains a strong hydrogen bond with D608, which is important
for the structural integrity of the hinge region that connects the
N- and C-terminal lobes of the kinase domain. The S611R
mutation, however, stereochemically interferes with binding of
the aniline and piperidine moieties of NMS-P715, but can maintain
a hydrogen bond to D608.
Interestingly, the residue I598 has no direct role in NMS-P715
binding, as it is located 12.4 Å from the nearest inhibitor atom.
Although bulkier, the phenylalanine side chain in the I598F
mutation can be accommodated in the hydrophobic environment
where it is placed, showing no direct stereochemical
clashes (Figure 4c). However, residue I598, being placed in the
hydrophobic spine, is relatively close to the catalytic pair E571 and
K553, which in the crystal structure are at 5.7 Å distance, indicating
a catalytically inactive conformation.30 Therefore, it is expected
that structural rearrangements take place in this region during the

catalytic activation of Mps1 and the I598F mutation could interfere
with this ﬂexibility (Figure 4c).
Expression of mutated Mps1 confers resistance to Mps1 inhibitors
To demonstrate that the identiﬁed Mps1 mutations are sufﬁcient
to cause drug resistance, we ectopically expressed the mutant
kinases as LAP-tagged fusions in U2OS cells, a strategy successfully
used previously with the Mps1 gatekeeper mutation M602Q.31
Stable cell lines ectopically expressing LAP-Mps1 showed similar
expression across all used constructs (Supplementary Figure 6b).
Although LAP-Mps1 was not able to increase the ability of cells to
withstand higher concentrations of Cpd-5 (31.9 nM compared with
33.2 nM), the mutant versions of LAP-Mps1 increased the
resistance of these cells to Cpd-5 in a similar manner as seen
before for the original mutant cell lines (Figure 5a; Supplementary
Figure 8a). These results conﬁrm that the identiﬁed Mps1
mutations indeed render the cells resistant to Cpd-5 with the
C604Y mutation having the strongest effect on survival of the
U2OS cells. In agreement with the increased cell survival, we ﬁnd
that the mutant LAP-Mps1 expressing cells could maintain a
checkpoint-dependent arrest in the presence of 100 nM
Cpd-5 (Figure 5b). Importantly, these results show that the

anti-proliferative effects of Cpd-5 are directly because of inhibition
of Mps1, and not because of off-target effects, at least not at doses
below 300 nM.
To demonstrate that endogenous expression of a mutant allele
can confer resistance to Mps1 inhibitors, we used CRISPR/Cas9mediated genome editing32,33 to engineer the C604Y mutation
into the HeLa histone H2B-YFP cell line for a straightforward
analysis of the cellular phenotypes. Interestingly, the C604 position
in Mps1 has one additional incentive because a search of the
COSMIC (catalog of somatic mutations in cancer) database34
revealed that it was found to be mutated into 604F in a tumor
sample of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma. To introduce the
C604F and C604Y mutations, we designed an oligonucleotide with
the desired mutation and two silent mutations to serve as a
template for homologous recombination after the Cas9-mediated
DNA double-strand break formation (Figure 6a). The selection with
80 nM Cpd-5 only yielded clones in the presence of both the
Cas9/gRNA and the oligonucleotide (Figure 6b). Genomic DNA
and Mps1 cDNA derived from individual cell clones was
sequenced for the presence of the desired point mutation and
the silent mutations (Figure 6c). After the conﬁrmation of
the successful genome-editing approach, we characterized the

resistance shows that inhibitor-resistant mutations in human
tumor material, similar to the ones we have obtained in cultured
cell lines, can be present.

mutant clones for their sensitivity against Cpd-5. The HeLa-C604Y
had a 12.3x, and the C604F a 6.3x higher IC50 for Cpd-5 than the
parental HeLa cells (Figure 6d). To further characterize the C604Y
and C604F clones, we performed live cell imaging experiments.
Although the average time HeLa cells spent in mitosis decreased
drastically after administration of 100 nM Cpd-5 (see also
Figure 2b), HeLa-C604F and C604Y cells stayed merely unaffected
even at 200 nM of Cpd-5 (Supplementary Figure 9a). The decreased
mitotic timing in the parental HeLa cells was associated with 100%
severe segregation errors (Figure 6e). Although C604F cells
missegregated already with a rate of 70% at 200 nM Cpd-5, most
of the errors were only mild segregation errors (Figure 6e). This
increased to almost 100% severe segregations errors after the
administration of 400 nM Cpd-5, a concentration that was shown
to be lethal for the cells in the growth assay (Figures 6d and e).
Similar to the growth assay, with the C604Y cell line showing a
2x higher IC50 as the C604F cell line, also the errors in
chromosome segregation were less severe in this cell line. In fact,
at 400 nM Cpd-5 administration, HeLa-C604Y cells exhibited a
maximum of 70% and mostly mild segregation errors, comparable
to what HeLa-C604F cells encountered at 200 nM Cpd-5
(Figure 6e).
These data conﬁrm that the C604Y mutation is indeed the
causal mutation for the Cpd-5 resistance in HCT-116-C604Y cells.

Mutations in Mps1 confer resistance to other small-molecule Mps1
inhibitors
Given the fact that a variety of potent and speciﬁc Mps1
inhibitors have been described,10,11 we were interested to see if
the identiﬁed mutations could confer resistance to NMS-P715,12
Mps1-IN-3,14 MPI-0479605,15 AZ3146(ref. 16) and reversine17
(Supplementary Figure 1). All identiﬁed mutations conferred
resistance to NMS-P715 (which has a similar chemical structure
as Cpd-5), and AZ3146 (Supplementary Figures 10a and b;
Table 1). The HCT-I531M and HeLa-I598F cell lines showed only
a slight decreased sensitivity toward Mps1-IN-3, whereas the other
mutations showed increased resistance (Supplementary Figure
10c; Table 1). The I598F mutation also failed to confer signiﬁcant
resistance to MPI-0479605 and reversine compared with the nonmutated parental HeLa-cell line (Figures 7a and b; Table 1).
Interestingly, the C604Y (and C604F) mutation that represents the
most Cpd-5-resistant allele, and also shows full resistance to
MPI-0479605, retained full sensitivity to reversine, whereas all
other mutations caused resistance to reversine (Figures 7a and b;
Table 1). In order to investigate the reversine sensitivity of the
C604Y and C604F mutants in more detail, we performed live cell
imaging. HeLa-C604Y and HeLa-C604F in fact exhibited a
hypersensitivity to reversine, translating into shortening of mitosis
and increase of segregation errors at doses that keeps the parental
cells almost unaffected (Supplementary Figures 9b and c; 75 nM
+150 nM). Also, HCT-C604Y cells could not maintain a mitotic arrest
in the presence of reversine in stark contrast to HCT-I531M cells
(Supplementary Figure 9d). In addition, cell survival assays with
cell lines expressing LAP-tagged Mps1 mutants exhibited the
same sensitivity pattern (Supplementary Figures 9e and f). This
indicates that cell death in Mps1-C604Y/F mutated cells is caused
by speciﬁc inhibition of Mps1 and not via inhibition of a secondary
essential target.
These results show that except for the S611R mutation, which
conferred resistance to all tested inhibitors (Table 1), speciﬁc
mutations confer resistance only to speciﬁc inhibitors. In case of
reversine and MPI-0479605, this is of particular interest because
reversine is a des-methyl derivative of MPI-0479605 at the
C-2-aniline position, but exhibits a completely different spectrum
of resistant mutations in the light of Mps1 inhibition.
DISCUSSION
Mps1 inhibitors as potential anticancer therapy reagents
Here, we have identiﬁed several mutations in Mps1 that provide
resistance to Mps1 inhibitors. Mutations in the target kinase
should result in enhanced kinase activity in the presence of the
inhibitor and this can be achieved by hyperactivation of the kinase
or by selective inhibition of inhibitor binding, leaving ATP-binding
relatively unaffected. Our data provide no evidence for effects of
the identiﬁed mutations on kinase activity or stability, suggesting
that they must affect inhibitor binding. Similar studies in Aurora
and Polo-like kinases have identiﬁed several residues that confer
resistance to small-molecule inhibitors. In Aurora B, mutation of
Y156H and G160V can give rise to inhibitor resistance.23
Interestingly, sequence alignment of the kinase domains of Aurora
B and Mps1 shows that Aurora Y156 aligns with C604 in Mps1.
G160 on the other hand would be equivalent to D608 in Mps1,
which was not identiﬁed with our strategy. However, this residue
may be of importance, as the equivalent of Aurora B G160 has also
been found to be a critical residue in Aurora A (G216) in terms of
inhibitor resistance.35 Mutation of the adjacent residue T217 in
Aurora A has also been successfully used to investigate inhibitor

resistance to the Aurora A inhibitors MLN8054 and MLN8237.36 The
latter mutations were, however, not identiﬁed in cell lines but
mutated based on structural predictions. In light of Polo-like kinase
inhibitor resistance, the mutation R136G was identiﬁed in an
experimental approach based on structural features,25 as well as in
an in vivo study.24 Signiﬁcantly, the residue R136 is the equivalent to
G160 in Aurora B. These data provide evidence that these are
important residues in the kinases in the light of inhibitor resistance.
It would be interesting to investigate if the D608 mutation in Mps1
would also confer resistance to speciﬁc Mps1 inhibitors.
In addition to these Mps1 mutations, we also identiﬁed resistant
cell clones that do not contain mutations in Mps1, pointing to
alternative resistance mechanisms that will require further analysis.
From their position within the kinase, I531M, C604Y and S611R
are expected to interfere directly with binding of NMS-P715.
C604Y and S611R abrogate binding contacts and insert van der
Waals clashes with NMS-P715, whereas I531M disrupts favorable
hydrophobic stacking interactions with NMS-P715. The mutation
I598F, on the other hand, is located far away from the ATP-binding
site, but its effect on inhibitor binding may involve a conformational change through a rearrangement of E571 and K553.
Kumar et al.38 used computational modeling to ﬁt MPI-0479605
into the Mps1 crystal structure based on reversine-bound Aurora
kinase crystal structures (PDB-code: 2VGO).37 I531 in Mps1 was
predicted to be involved in a favorable van der Waals interaction
with the ortho-substituted aniline at the purine C2 position in
both reversine and MPI-0479605 respectively. Thus, the mutation
to methionine may indeed lead to a reduction of this favorable
interaction, making the mutant protein less receptive for the two
inhibitors.

It is therefore remarkable that the C604Y mutation has such a
tremendous effect on MPI-0479605 sensitivity, whereas reversine
retains full activity toward C604Y. Reversine is a des-methyl
derivative of MPI-0479605 at the C-2-aniline position, which is at
the position of the triﬂuoro-methoxy-moiety in NMS-P715. Thus,
the C604Y speciﬁcally blocks inhibitors with bulky modiﬁcations at
the C-2-aniline position, such as NMS-P715, but also MPI-0479605,
and Cpd-5, whereas leaving inhibitors without such modiﬁcations,
such as reversine, unaffected.
One mutation that exhibits increased resistance against all
investigated inhibitors is the S611R mutation. Particularly, the
efﬁcacy of reversine and MPI-0479605 is completely negated in
S611R-mutated cells. Probably the aniline–morpholine moieties of
MPI-0479605 and reversine bind at the same position as the
chemically similar aniline–piperidine moiety of NMS-P715, which is
blocked by the S611R mutation. However, as MPI-0479605 and
reversine are smaller molecules, they probably depend more on
this interaction than NMS-P715, which has more additional
binding contacts, explaining the relatively large impact of this
mutation on MPI-0479605 and reversine binding.
The effects of the I598F mutation are much less pronounced
compared with the other mutations, possibly as a result of its
distance from the ATP-binding site. An overlay of the structure of
Mps1 in complex with NMS-P715 bound,12 with Mps1 bound to
ATP30 and a recent structure in which the K553/E571 catalytic
pair has a more catalytically competent conformation,39 shows
structural variability particularly in the area around Y568,
neighboring the mutated I598. As Mps1 inhibitors exert (part of)
their effect through interfering with the K553/E571 catalytic pair,30
it is not unlikely that the I598F mutation may limit Y568 ﬂexibility,

in turn limiting the ability of the inhibitors to disrupt the K553/
E571 catalytic pair.
In conclusion, we have shown that the four identiﬁed mutations
have different effects on the resistance to various Mps1 inhibitors.
Our work shows that mutations in Mps1, which render cells
insensitive to a speciﬁc inhibitor, may still be targetable by a
different Mps1 inhibitor scaffold. It is therefore advisable to
intensify the search for additional Mps1 mutations and use the
here identiﬁed mutations as de novo drug targets to identify new
inhibitor scaffolds, which can target these mutations. The example
of the C604Y response to MPI-0479605 and reversine is the perfect
example to justify such a strategy.
The mutations we have identiﬁed here also provide powerful
tools to determine whether the antitumor effects and toxicity
proﬁles of inhibitors seen in rodent xenograft models are the
result of Mps1 inhibition or of an off-target effect. In addition, our
data indicate that drug resistance is likely to occur when using the
available Mps1 inhibitors, but highlight the possibility that this
problem may be mitigated through further drug optimization and
clever combinations of the already available Mps1 inhibitors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (Lonza,
Basel, Switzerland), supplemented with 6% fetal calf serum (Clontech,
Mountain View, CA, USA), 50 μg/ml penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen,
Waltham, MA, USA) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Lonza). Thymidine (2.5 mM) and
nocodazole (200 ng/ml) were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA).
HeLa cells stably expressing H2B-YFP were created using retroviral
infection with pBabe-H2B-YFP (kind gift from Dr Susanne Lens, University
Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands). Cell lines were selected with
5 μg/ml blasticidine (Sigma). U2OS cells stably expressing LAP-Mps1 were

infected with retrovirus carrying pBabe-LAP-Mps1 and were selected with
5 μg/ml blasticidine. LAP-Mps1 I531M, I598F, C604Y and S611R were
created by site-directed mutagenesis PCR. All cell lines were tested
negative for Mycoplasma contamination.

Antibodies
The following antibodies were used: phospho-histone H3-Ser10 (#06-570,
Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), penta-His (#34660, Qiagen, Venlo,
Netherlands), Mps1-NT (#05-682, Merck Millipore), CREST (#15-235-0001,
Antibodies Inc., Davis, CA, USA). Phospho-KNL1 MELT13/17 was a kind gift
from Geert Kops.40

Proliferation/colony formation assay
Cells (~1500 per 96-well; ~ 600 per 6-well) were plated on 6-well or
96-wells plates (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) (day 0). Inhibitors
were added on day 1. On day 6 (96-well) or day 14 (6-well), plates were
ﬁxed for 10 min with 96% methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet and
washed with dH2O. Dried plates were scanned for analysis and analyzed
with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Cell survival graph
preparation and IC50 calculation were achieved with GraphPad Prism
software (La Jolla, CA, USA).

Time-lapse microscopy
For live cell imaging, cells were plated in eight-well chamber slides (Ibidi,
Martinsried, Germany) in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium. Directly
before imaging, the medium was replaced by Leibovitz’s L-15 (GIBCO,
Waltham, MA, USA) CO2-independent medium. Images were obtained
using a DeltaVision Elite (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA, USA) maintained
at 37°C equipped with a 20x 0.75 NA lens (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) or 40x
0.6 NA lens (Olympus) and cooled CoolSnap CCD camera (Photometrics,
Tucson, AZ, USA). Image analysis was done using ImageJ software (NIH).

Shown are the median IC50s (in nM) for the Mps1 inhibitors NMS-P715, AZ3146, Mps1-IN-3, MPI-0479605 and reversine. Three independent experiments
(Figure 7, Supplementary Figure 10) were the basis of the calculation.

Mitotic index determination
Cells (~10 000 per well) were plated on 96-wells plates (BD Biosciences)
(day 0). At day 1, nocodazole and Cpd-5 were added for 16 h and cells
were ﬁxed using 5% formaldehyde. Cells were stained with an antibody
against phospho-histone H3-Ser10 (Merck Millipore) and 4,6-diamidino-2phenylindole. Image acquisition was performed using a DeltaVision Elite
(Applied Precision) using a 10x 0.4NA objective. Up to nine images were
acquired per well, which covered around 3000 cells in total. Image analysis
was performed using ImageJ software (NIH). The percentage of mitotic
cells was determined by the amount of phospho-histone H3-Ser10-positive
cells over the total 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-positive cells.

RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and sequencing
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and cDNA was
synthesized using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen)
and random hexamer primers according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Western blotting
Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl,
1% Triton-X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM orthovanadate, 25 mM beta-glycerophosphate and protease inhibitor cocktail

sequenced Mps1 cDNA.

Protein puriﬁcation
GST-KNL1 constructs were generated by insertion of the KNL1-M3
(aa801-1052)28 into the Xho1 site of pGEX-6P-1. GST-KNL1 constructs were
expressed in BL21(DE3):DNAK for 4 h at 20 °C with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-1thiogalactopyranoside. Cell pellets were sonicated and lysed in lysis buffer
(1x phosphate-buffered saline solution, 0.1% Tween, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM 2mercaptoethanol, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 10% glycerol). Proteins were
puriﬁed using glutathioneagarose beads (Sigma) and eluted with 50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mM reduced glutathione (Roche), 75 mM KCl, followed by
buffer exchange using desalting columns (Bio-Rad) in buffer containing
12.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 35 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.005%
Triton-X and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol.
Mps1 kinase domain constructs (aa519–808) were generated by ligation
independent cloning into pETNKI-his3C-LIC-Kan. Mps1 cDNA of hTert-RPE1
cells served as a template. His-Mps1 constructs were expressed in Rosetta
(DE3)pLysS for 5 h at 20 °C with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Puriﬁcation was performed as previously described.42

In vitro kinase assays
In all, 100 ng of the different versions of Mps1 was incubated for 10 min at
32 °C with the indicated compounds in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.2 mM ATP.
After this incubation, 200 ng of puriﬁed GST-KNL1-M3 was added, and the
mixture was incubated for 60 min at 32 °C before addition of SDS-sample
buffer and boiling at 95 °C for 10 min.

Modeling
Amino-acid mutations were modeled in the structure of the Mps1 kinase
domain complexed with NMS-P71512 (PDB identiﬁer 2X9E), using the
program Coot.43 For all amino-acid side chains, a conformer was chosen
that belongs to the top 3 most frequently occurring conformers, and which
ﬁtted best in the Mps1 protein structure. Unless otherwise indicated, no
adjustments or energy minimizations were performed on non-mutated
parts of Mps1. Pictures were made using the program Pymol (New York,
NY, USA).
