Abstract

Author Manuscript

Recognition of modified histone species by distinct structural domains within “reader” proteins
plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression. Readers that simultaneously recognize
histones with multiple marks allow transduction of complex chromatin modification patterns into
specific biological outcomes. Here, we report that chromatin regulator TRIM24 functions as a
reader of dual histone marks via tandem Plant Homeodomain (PHD) and Bromodomain (Bromo).
The three-dimensional structure of TRIM24 PHD-Bromo revealed a single functional unit for
combinatorial recognition of unmodified H3K4 (H3K4me0) and acetylated H3K23 (H3K23ac)
within the same histone tail. TRIM24 binds chromatin and estrogen receptor to activate estrogendependent genes associated with cellular proliferation and tumor development. Aberrant
expression of TRIM24 negatively correlates with survival of breast cancer patients. The PHDBromo of TRIM24 provides a structural rationale for chromatin activation via a noncanonical
histone signature, establishing a new paradigm by which chromatin readers may influence cancer
pathogenesis.

Post-translational modifications of histones occur in combinations that must be faithfully
translated by effector proteins, or histone readers1–4. The lexicon of histone modifications
may be highly context-dependent, influenced by inductive signaling, cellular milieu and
target gene status4. Misinterpretation or imbalance in this hierarchal arrangement has dire
consequences for cellular homeostasis, leading to developmental problems, hereditary
disease or tumor development5. Linked histone reader modules, such as tandem PHD finger
and Bromodomain, occur frequently in histone interacting proteins but little is known about
their mechanisms of action. Combinatorial readout of histone post-translational
modifications (PTM’s) may enhance binding between spatially separated histone marks, or
even create communication links between domains or members of the complex3.
Individually, proteins with Bromodomains, e.g. TAF1 and BDF1, associate with acetylated
lysines with broad specificity6,7, while PHD-containing proteins are less predictable in their
interactions1–4. The PHD fingers of BHC80 and AIRE interact with unmethylated H3K4
(H3K4me0)8,9, while other previously reported PHD finger domains bind methylated
proteins as modifiers of histones or subunits of chromatin remodeling, co-activator or corepressor complexes1–4,10–17.
PHD-finger proteins and their dysregulation are linked to a broad spectrum of human
diseases, underscoring an essential role in homeostasis5. Recently, aberrant localization of a
JARID1A PHD finger-fusion protein was shown as directly causal in transformation and
development of hematopoietic malignancy, a process requiring fusion protein recognition of
H3K4me3 via the JARID1A PHD finger18. Here, we present evidence that a multifunctional protein, TRIM24, which is an E3-ubiquitin ligase that targets p5319 and is

broadly associated with chromatin silencing20, relies on tandem PHD finger and
Bromodomain (designated PHD-Bromo) to recognize specific, combinatorial histone
modifications and activate estrogen-dependent genes associated with cellular proliferation
and tumor development. Genome-wide analysis of chromatin interactions shows estrogendependent binding of TRIM24 and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) at sites that paradoxically
exhibit estrogen-activated loss of H3K4me2 and gain of histone acetylation. Importantly,
aberrant over expression of TRIM24 in breast cancer patients is frequent and directly
correlated with poor survival.

TRIM24 PHD-Bromo binds N-terminal H3 tail

Author Manuscript

TRIM24 belongs to the TRIM/RBCC protein family, characterized by a conserved, amino
(N)-terminal tripartite motif: a RING domain, B-box zinc-fingers, a coiled-coil region, as
well as variable carboxy (C)-terminal domains21,22. TRIM24 was originally identified as
Transcriptional Intermediary Factor (TIF) 1α, a ligand-dependent, co-repressor of retinoic
acid receptor that interacts with multiple nuclear receptors in vitro via an LXXLL motif23.
In addition to its LXXLL motif and RING domain, TRIM24 has a C-terminal, PHD-Bromo
(Fig. 1a), which likely recognizes histones or non-histone proteins with specific
combinations of post-translational modifications.

Author Manuscript

Protein sequence alignment of the PHD fingers of TRIM24 and BHC80 with ING1, a PHD
domain that recognizes H3K4me324,25, showed TRIM24 as highly similar to BHC80 with
conservation of residues critical for BHC80-H3K4me0 interactions8 (Supplementary Fig.
1a). Accordingly, we found that full-length TRIM24 interacts with histone proteins
specifically through its PHD-Bromo (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Binding of the TRIM24 PHDBromo to histone peptide arrays occurs at unmodified H3 (residues 1–21), methylated H3K9
(H3K9me) and acetylated H3K9/K14 peptides, but not methylated H3K4 residues
(Supplementary Fig. 1c). Similarly, TRIM24 PHD finger and PHD-Bromo bind unmodified
histone H3 (residues 1–21) but not methylated H3K4, similar to BHC80 but unlike ING1,
which preferentially binds to H3K4me peptides (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1d). GSTpulldown assays with native histones confirmed that TRIM24 PHD finger, Bromodomain,
PHD-Bromo and the BHC80 PHD fail to bind to native histone H3 with K4 trimethylation
(H3K4me3) but tolerate H3K9me2 modification (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1e).
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) based binding assays established that the PHD-Bromo
binds unmodified H3(1–15)K4 with a KD of 8.6 μM, while methylation of H3K4 greatly
decreases binding affinity of TRIM24 and H3 peptides (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 2).
These results suggest that TRIM24 PHD-Bromo interacts with the N-terminal tail of histone
H3 but specific PTM’s, e.g. methylation of H3K4, interfere with this interaction.

Structural basis of H3 readout by TRIM24
We have determined the three-dimensional crystal structure of the PHD-linker-Bromo
segment (residues 824–1006) of human TRIM24 in free and histone peptide bound states.
The overall structure of TRIM24 PHD-Bromo in the free state demonstrates that PHD and
Bromodomain interact extensively and form an integrated structural unit (747 Å2 of contact
surface), connected by a long linker and stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonding and

hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). The
TRIM24 PHD finger residues 824–871 adopt the typical PHD finger ‘cross-braced’
topology stabilized by a pair of coordinated zinc ions, which together with residues 872–884
from the linker region form an extended TRIM24 PHD domain. The TRIM24 Bromodomain
adopts the typical left-handed four-helical bundle characteristic of other members of this
family.

Author Manuscript

The 2.0 Å co-crystal structure of TRIM24 PHD-Bromo and unmodified H3(1–10)K4
peptide (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3a) showed that the first 9 residues
of bound H3 peptide are positioned within a surface groove of the PHD finger (Fig. 2b and
Supplementary Fig. 3b). The R2 to Q5 segment of bound H3 peptide forms an anti-parallel
β-sheet with the E837 to C840 segment of the PHD finger, while the T6 to K9 segment of
bound H3 peptide contacts the N834 to G836 segment of the PHD finger. The side chain of
R2 is hydrogen-bonded with the backbone carbonyl of C841. The side chain of C840 is
positioned in-between the side chains of R2 and K4, with the C840W mutation losing its
ability to bind unmodified H3K4 peptide (KD > 400 μM, Supplementary Table 2 and
Supplementary Fig. 4).

Author Manuscript

The unmodified lysine ammonium group of H3K4 forms two direct hydrogen bonds with
backbone carbonyl oxygens of N825 and E826 (Fig. 2b). In addition, the proximally
positioned D827 forms a stabilizing salt bridge with the unmodified lysine, consistent with
the observation of impaired binding between D827A mutant and unmodified H3K4 peptide
(KD = 133 μM, Supplementary Table 2). Methylation of H3K4 would create steric clashes
with residues lining the binding pocket, disrupt the salt bridge interaction with D827, and
impair hydrogen bonding with N825 and E826, thereby providing a structural explanation
for the unmodified H3K4 preference of TRIM24 PHD-Bromo.

TRIM24 Bromodomain is H3K23ac-specific
Both sequence and structure-based alignments indicate that TRIM24 Bromodomain is an
acetyllysine reader. Peptide pulldown assays and NMR titration measurements suggest that
TRIM24 Bromodomain interacts with H3 peptides with K23 or K27 acetylation and several
acetylated H4 peptides (Supplementary Fig. 5a and 5b). ITC studies establish that TRIM24
PHD-Bromo specifically binds to the H3(13–32)K23ac peptide with a dissociation constant
(KD = 8.8 μM; Supplementary Table 2), comparable to tetra-acetylated H4 peptide and
double Bromodomain modules of TAF1 or BDF1.

Author Manuscript

We solved the 1.9 Å crystal structure of the complex of TRIM24 PHD-Bromo and H3(13–
32)K23ac peptide (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 6a). Residues 23–27 of
the bound H3(13–32)K23ac peptide exhibit sequence-specific interactions with TRIM24
Bromodomain (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 6b). The acetyllysine side chain forms a
direct hydrogen bond with the side chain of conserved N980. Acetyllysine recognition
constitutes the binding determinant, as double mutant F979A/N980A loses most of the
binding affinity for the H3(13–32)K23ac peptide (Supplementary Table 2).
ITC studies establish that H3(1–20)K9ac, H3(1–19)K14ac and H3(13–32)K27ac bind nonspecifically to the TRIM24 Bromodomain (KD ~ 200 μM Supplementary Table 2). The

crystal structure of the complex of TRIM24 PHD-Bromo with H3(23–31)K27ac peptide
(Supplementary Table 1) revealed a single intermolecular hydrogen bond between the side
chains of K27ac and N980, while other histone residues did not show any direct
intermolecular contacts with the Bromodomain (Supplementary Fig. 7), consistent with
weak binding affinity of H3(13–32)K27ac peptide. The structure of TRIM24 PHD-Bromo
bound to H4(14–19)K16ac peptide containing the conserved interaction between K16ac and
N980 side chains is shown in Supplementary Fig. 8.

Author Manuscript

The structures of TRIM24 PHD-Bromo complexes with acetyllysine-containing histone
peptides show that acetyllysine invariantly inserts into a pre-formed acetyllysine-binding
pocket of the bromodomain. With the acetyllysine as an anchor, flanking residues determine
sequence specificity of acetyllysine peptides for the TRIM24 bromodomain. The H3(13–
32)K23ac peptide both fits better within the cleft between ZA and BC loops, and shows
sequence-specific interactions with TRIM24 Bromodomain spanning K23ac to K27,
creating much higher affinity for the TRIM24 Bromodomain, versus other acetyllysinecontaining peptides.

Combinatorial readout by TRIM24 PHD-Bromo
Superimposition of the above structures of complexes revealed that H3K4 and H3K23ac
peptides are aligned in the same direction on the surface of the TRIM24 PHD-Bromo (Fig.
2d). The distance between the Cα of H3K9 and the Cα of H3K23ac is 25.5 Å, which allows
one H3 peptide containing both unmodified H3K4 and H3K23ac to simultaneously target
the PHD and Bromodomain binding sites on TRIM24 PHD-Bromo.

Author Manuscript

By contrast, H3K4 and H3K27ac (or H4K16ac) peptides are aligned in opposite directions
on the surface of TRIM24 PHD-Bromo (Supplementary Fig. 9), which indicates that the
TRIM24 PHD-Bromo requires two histone tails, either within a single nucleosome or from
an adjacent pair of nucleosomes, to simultaneously bind H3K4 and H3K27ac (or H4K16ac).

Author Manuscript

To test the effect of combinatorial readout of TRIM24 PHD-Bromo for histone H3 bearing
unmodified K4 and acetylated K23 dual marks, we synthesized longer H3(1–33) peptides
bearing both unmodified K4 and acetylated K23 marks. For controls, we used H3(1–
33)K4me3K23ac, as well as H3(1–33)K4 peptides that have only one effective histone mark
for specific TRIM24 PHD-Bromo recognition. Based on ITC binding assays, TRIM24 PHDBromo showed an approximately 90-fold higher binding affinity for H3(1–33)K4K23ac
peptide (Fig. 2e, KD = 0.096 μM) compared to the shorter H3(1–15)K4 peptide bearing only
unmodified K4 (KD = 8.6 μM) or for the H3(13–32)K23ac peptide bearing only acetylated
K23 marks (KD = 8.8 μM). Without acetylation on K23, the binding for H3(1–33)K4 is 24fold weaker (Fig. 2e; KD = 2.3 μM); when K4 is tri-methylated, the binding for H3(1–
33)K4me3K23ac is 6-fold weaker (Fig. 2e; KD = 0.56 μM). Similarly, mutants that disrupt
either the PHD finger binding pocket (C840W) or bromodomain binding pocket (F979A/
N980A) also decreased binding for H3(1–33)K4K23ac peptide by 6–7 fold (Fig. 2e and
Supplementary Table 2).
By fluorescence polarization (FP) based measurement, wild-type TRIM24 PHD-Bromo also
showed strong binding affinity for H3(1–33)K4K23ac peptide (KD = 0.185 μM); peptides

trimethylated at K4 or without acetylation at K23 displayed 13–23 fold weaker interaction
(Fig. 2f and Supplementary Table 3). Mutation on the PHD finger binding pocket (C840W)
or the Bromodomain binding pocket (F979A/N980A) showed similar decrease in binding
affinities (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Table 3). These binding data strongly support our
structural results, which indicate that unmodified H3K4 and acetylated H3K23 are a pair of
natural histone marks targeted by TRIM24 PHD-Bromo that can be read in a combinatorial
manner on a single histone peptide. This combinatorial readout can greatly increase the
recruitment of TRIM24 to nucleosomes bearing these two marks.

TRIM24 and ERα recruitment to chromatin

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Combinatorial histone modifications of unmethylated H3K4 alongside acetylated lysines
have no straightforward interpretation by the paradigms of chromatin modification and
regulated activation or repression of transcription. We considered a model where TRIM24
regulates gene expression by specific binding to chromatin with non-canonical combinations
of PTM’s, and focused on co-regulation of ERα, as in vitro interactions between TRIM24
and nuclear receptors, including ERα, are ligand-dependent (Supplementary Fig. 10 and 26),
and ligand-activated, ER-response elements (ERE’s) are notably independent of H3K4me2
and H3K4me3 modifications27,28. We used ChIP and sequential ChIP analyses of ERαpositive, MCF7 breast cancer cells to assess whether TRIM24 is recruited with ERα to
specific ERE’s of the GREB1, PR and pS2/TFF1 genes (Fig 3a, 3b and Supplementary Fig.
11). Estrogen-activated recruitment occurs robustly within 15 minutes, and by six hours
yields a 7-fold increase of ERα and 6-fold increase of TRIM24 binding at the GREB1 distal
ERE, ~40 Kb upstream of the transcription start site (Fig. 3a). ChIP analysis of H3K4me2/3
after estrogen treatment indicates that quantified H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels decreased
at distal ERE sites (Supplementary Fig. 12 and 27) and, when normalized for nucleosomal
occupancy, decreased or are unchanged at distal ERE’s (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 13).
Importantly, TRIM24 is recruited in the absence of changes in H3K4 methylation. In
contrast, H3K23ac, H3K27ac and H4ac, which are targeted by the TRIM24 Bromodomain,
are enriched at both distal and proximal ERE’s after E2-addition (Fig. 3d). These findings
suggest that TRIM24 interacts with ERα and chromatin lacking H3K4 methylation but
enriched in lysine acetylation, as suggested by our structural analyses, in response to
estrogen.

Author Manuscript

These findings stand in contrast to a model of chromatin accessibility at ER binding sites,
facilitated by FOXA1 and H3K4me2 enrichment in response to estrogen treatment29, but are
in agreement with findings that H3K4me3 is not present at a majority of distal ERE
regions28. We evaluated global chromatin- association of TRIM24, ERα and H3K4me2, by
ChIP and deep sequencing of antibody-enriched DNA fragments (ChIP-seq). These analyses
revealed binding of TRIM24 and ER at more than 10,000 sites genome-wide; half of which,
in each case, are estrogen-dependent (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 14a). Shared target
sites of ERα and co-regulator TRIM24 increase dramatically (eight- fold) in response to
estrogen (Supplementary Fig. 14b), are highly enriched (p- value<0.001) at genes regulated
by estrogen30 (Supplementary Fig. 14c), and function in cell cycle, kinase activity and signal
transduction (DAVID analyses31, Supplementary Table 4). Biological pathway analysis
(IngenuityR Systems, www.ingenuity.com) revealed that multiple gene targets of TRIM24

are associated with breast cancer (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). The number of target sites
shared by TRIM24 and ERα (1677 sites) is similar to ERα and FOXA129, with little overlap
among all three (263 sites) (Supplementary Fig. 14b). Consistent with our structural
analyses, TRIM24 binding occurs globally at sites depleted of H3K4me2 (Fig. 3f and
Supplementary Figs. 14d and 15). Thus, ERα-regulated genes may be divided into multiple
classes, defined by specific co-regulators and their dependence on H3K4 methylation.

TRIM24 is over expressed in breast cancer

Author Manuscript

Depletion of TRIM24 caused a significant decrease in ERα-mediated activation of GREB1,
PR and pS2 gene expression (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 16a). Importantly, reintroduction of wild type (WT), but not PHD finger mutant (C840W), TRIM24 fully
restored ERα-mediated transcription activation (Fig. 4b), and enabled ERα-response at
lower levels of hormone (Fig. 4c). Decreased ERα-mediated activation is due to loss of
TRIM24-dependent ERα-interactions with chromatin (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 17),
without alternation of ERα expression (Supplementary Fig. 16b). H3K4me2/3 levels at the
distal ERE of GREB1 lack hormone responsiveness and are TRIM24-independent (Fig. 4d
and Supplementary Fig. 16c). In contrast, nucleosomal occupancy at ERE’s is increased
alongside decreased acetylation of H4, H3K23 and H3K27, reflecting loss of ERα-activated
chromatin structure (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 16c).

Author Manuscript

Strikingly, depletion of TRIM24 led to reduced survival and proliferation of tumor-derived
breast cancer cells, and is highly additive with 4-OH-tamoxifen, an inhibitor of ERα32 (Fig.
5a). We immunostained tissue samples from a breast cancer patient cohort to assess the
impact of TRIM24 expression in breast cancer survival (Fig. 5b). In 128 cases of
nonmetastatic breast cancer, expression of TRIM24 fell into four classes: N- and N+,
undetectable to low level in few foci (29%); N++, abundant foci with expression in nuclear
and cytoplasmic compartments (20%); and, N+++, abundant foci with high expression in
nuclei (51%). Over expression of TRIM24 (+++, ++) is clearly correlated with poor patient
survival, independent of ER-status (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 7).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Our identification of the PHD-Bromo as a reader of H3K4me0 and H3K23ac within a single
histone tail or H3K4me0 and noncontiguous acetylated lysines suggests that TRIM24 may
have multiple roles in chromatin regulation20. TRIM24 is a co-activator of ERα at distal
ERE’s, a platform well suited for stable interactions with TRIM24 PHD-Bromo. ERα
recruits histone acetyltransferases, e.g. CBP/p300, GCN5 and P/CAF33, to acetylate
histones. LSD1 (KDM1), a biochemically and structurally characterized demethylase for
H3K4me2/134,35 and androgen-regulated demethylase of H3K9me36, is resident37 or rapidly
recruited27 to ERE’s where H3K4 remains depleted of methylation even with estrogen
activation (Fig 3c, Supplementary Fig. 18 and 28). These parallel processes establish a
combinatorial histone signature with high affinity for TRIM24 binding to chromatin.
Aberrant expression of TRIM24 may promote tumor development and progression by
multiple mechanisms of dysfunction. TRIM24 is a potent co- activator of ERα, which is

associated with cellular proliferation and neoplasia in breast cells38,39, and a negative
regulator of p53 stability19. TRIM24 is a target of chromosomal translocations to form
oncogenic fusion proteins in acute promyelocytic leukemia40, papillary thyroid carcinoma41
and myeloprolferative syndrome42. Here, we show that TRIM24 expression is directly
correlated with poor patient survival in both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer.
These results suggest that TRIM24 is a dual domain, histone reader with considerable
potential as a therapeutic target in multiple cancers.

METHODS SUMMARY

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Wild-type and mutant forms of TRIM24 PHD-Bromo were expressed in E.coli and purified
to homogeneity. Histone biotinylated peptides or purified histone proteins were incubated
with GST-proteins, and bound proteins detected by immunoblotting. All crystals were
obtained by hanging-drop method at 20°C, structures were solved by molecular replacement
method and refined with cycled model building and refinement procedures. Histone peptides
with or without biotin labeling were used for ITC binding. Fluorescein-labeled peptides
were used for fluorescence polarization analysis. Stable shControl and shTRIM24 MCF7
cells were maintained with 2.5 μg/mL puromycin and, for hormone treatment, were grown
in hormone-free media for 96 h prior to addition of ethanol or 10 nM estradiol (Sigma) for
indicated times. Global expression analyses and calculation of enrichment of shared
TRIM24 and ERα binding at estrogen- regulated genes30 were determined, and validated by
real-time RT-PCR. Surgical specimens of breast cancer from 128 nonmetastatic patients
were immunostained for TRIM 24 (TRIM24 antibody, Proteintech Group, Inc., Chicago,
IL), and scored by subcellular localization (nuclear, N), staining intensity, and fraction of
positive staining. The overall survival after surgery was plotted by the Kaplan-Meier
method43.
