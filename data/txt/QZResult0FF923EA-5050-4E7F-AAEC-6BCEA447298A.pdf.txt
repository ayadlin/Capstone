Metformin Decreases the Dose of Chemotherapy for
Prolonging Tumor Remission in Mouse Xenografts Involving
Multiple Cancer Cell Types
Dimitrios Iliopoulos, Heather A. Hirsch, and Kevin Struhl

Abstract
Metformin, the first-line drug for treating diabetes, selectively kills the chemotherapy resistant subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSC) in genetically distinct types of breast cancer cell lines. In mouse
xenografts, injection of metformin and the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin near the tumor is more
effective than either drug alone in blocking tumor growth and preventing relapse. Here, we show that
metformin is equally effective when given orally together with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and doxorubicin,
indicating that metformin works together with a variety of standard chemotherapeutic agents. In addition,
metformin has comparable effects on tumor regression and preventing relapse when combined with a fourfold reduced dose of doxorubicin that is not effective as a monotherapy. Finally, the combination of
metformin and doxorubicin prevents relapse in xenografts generated with prostate and lung cancer cell lines.
These observations provide further evidence for the CSC hypothesis for cancer relapse, an experimental
rationale for using metformin as part of combinatorial therapy in a variety of clinical settings, and for
reducing the chemotherapy dose in cancer patients. Cancer Res; 71(9); 3196â€“201. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Although chemotherapeutic regimens often suppress
tumor growth, cancer patients show high variability in their
responses and commonly develop resistance to these drugs
and recurrence of the tumor. To explain this phenomenon, the
cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis suggests that tumors contain a small number of tumor-forming, self-renewing CSCs
within a population of nontumor-forming cancer cells (1, 2).
Unlike most cells within the tumor, CSCs are resistant to
chemotherapy, and after treatment, they can regenerate all the
cell types in the tumor through their stem cellâ€“like behavior. A
prediction of this CSC hypothesis is that treatments that
selectively inhibit CSCs should function together with chemotherapeutic drugs to delay relapse. Strong support for the
CSC hypothesis comes from our observations that metformin,
the first-line drug for treating diabetes, and microRNA-200
(miR-200) selectively kill CSCs and act together with doxorubicin to reduce tumor growth and prolong remission (3, 4).
Another major problem that cancer patients face is the high
toxicity of the chemotherapeutic drugs. The side effects
include anemia, appetite changes, fatigue, hair loss, nausea,

vomiting, and fertility changes (5). On the contrary, lower
doses of these chemotherapeutic agents are not effective in
suppressing tumor growth. Thus, the identification of agents
that can be combined with lower doses of the existing
chemotherapeutic drugs is of high clinical relevance.
Epidemiologic studies have revealed that diabetes is correlated with increased cancer risk (6, 7), and that diabetics
treated with metformin have reduced risk of developing
various types of cancer (8, 9). In addition, mRNA profiling
of 2 isogenic models of cellular transformation defined a
transcriptional signature that links multiple types of cancer
with diabetes and other metabolic diseases (10). Metformin is
an extensively used and well-tolerated drug for treating individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and polycystic ovarian
syndrome. Metformin inhibits growth of breast cancer cell
lines (11â€“13), blocks cellular transformation in an inducible
model system (3, 10), and has antitumor effects in mouse
xenografts (3, 10, 14, 15). As mentioned above, we showed that
metformin selectively inhibits the growth of CSCs in genetically distinct breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, in mouse
xenografts involving a human breast cancer cell line, coinjection of metformin and doxorubicin intraperitoneally (i.p.) near
the tumor increases the rate of tumor regression compared
with treatment with doxorubicin alone, and this combinatorial therapy prevents relapse for at least several months (3).
Our previous studies of metformin-based combinatorial
therapy in mouse xenografts were carried out by i.p. injection,
and they involved a single concentration of one chemotherapeutic agent and tumors generated by a single breast
cancer cell line. Here, we extend these studies to address
(i) the efficacy of metformin administered orally as compared

with i.p. injection, (ii) the ability of metformin to act together
with chemotherapeutic agents other than doxorubicin, (iii)
the effect of metformin on the concentration of chemotherapeutic drugs needed for a prolonging remission, and (iv)
whether combinatorial therapy involving metformin is effective on other cancer cell types. Our results show that oral
administration of metformin is effective with multiple chemotherapeutic agents and multiple cancer cell types, and that
metformin can reduce the dose of chemotherapy necessary to
prolong remission. These preclinical observations strongly
support the use of metformin-based combinatorial chemotherapy in multiple cancer contexts, and they provide
further evidence for the CSC hypothesis for relapse.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
MCF-10A cells are mammary epithelial cells derived from
fibrocystic breast tissue from women with no family history of
breast cancer and no evidence of disease; these cells do not
express estrogen receptor (ER). The experiments here use a
derivative of MCF-10A containing an integrated fusion of the
v-Src oncoprotein with the ligand-binding domain of ER (3).
BT-474 cells are human breast carcinoma cells that overexpress HER2 receptor, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells are
human mammary adenocarcinoma cells with mutation in
p53 and overexpression of epidermal growth factor (EGF)
receptor and are highly metastatic. PC3 cells are highly
metastatic grade IV prostate adenocarcinoma cells, and
A549 cells are human lung epithelial carcinoma cells.
Cell culture
BT-474, MDA-MB-231, and PC3 cells were grown in DMEM
media (Invitrogen), 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 C with 5% CO2. A549
cells were grown in RPMI1640 media (Invitrogen), 10% FBS
(Atlanta Biologicals), and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen)
at 37 C with 5% CO2. MCF10A ER-Src cells were cultured as
described previously (16) and induced to transform with 1 mM
4OH-tamoxifen dissolved (Sigma) in ethanol. Transformation
occurred 36 hours after tamoxifen treatment.
Chemicals
Metformin was dissolved in water and was typically added
to 0.1 mmol/L. Doxorubicin and paclitaxel were dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide, and carboplatin was dissolved in water. All
chemicals were obtained from Sigmaâ€“Aldrich.
Mammosphere culture
Mammospheres were cultured in suspension (1,000 cells/
mL) in serum-free DMEM/F12 media, supplemented with B27
(1:50; Invitrogen), 0.4% bovine serum albumin, 20 ng/mL EGF
(Preprotech), and 4 mg/mL insulin (Sigma) as described previously (16). Mammosphere growth was tested by placing
purified CD44high/CD24low cells from 3 human mammary
adenocarcinoma tissues in suspension, and adding metformin
to 6-day-old mammospheres and counting the number of
mammospheres 2 days after treatment.

Human breast tissues
Three snap-frozen ductal carcinoma tissues were purchased from AMS Biotechnology and Biochain Inc. The purification process of CD44high and CD24high derived from
human breast tumors has been previously described (17â€“
19), and it is detailed in the Supplementary Methods.
Xenograft experiments
Cancer cells (5  106) were injected into the right flank of
female nu/nu mice (Charles River Laboratories), all of which
developed tumors in 10 days with size of approximately 55
mm3. For each experiment, mice were randomly distributed
into equal groups (3â€“4 mice per group) that were untreated,
or treated by intratumoral injections every 5 days (4 cycles)
with 1 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg doxorubicin, 10 mg/kg paclitaxel,
20 mg/kg carboplatin, 200 mg/mL metformin (diluted in
drinking water and present throughout the experiment starting at day 10), or combinations that included metformin.
Tumor volume (mean  SD; mm3) was measured at various
times after the initial injection. All the mouse experiments
were conducted in accordance with Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee procedures and guidelines of Tufts
University.

Results
Oral administration of metformin is equally effective as
intraperitoneal injection near the tumor
In our previous experiments showing that the combination
of metformin and doxorubicin accelerates tumor regression
and prolongs remission in mouse xenografts, the drugs were
administered by i.p. injection near the tumors (3). However,
clinical use of metformin in diabetes is typically conducted by
oral administration, and this would clearly be a preferred
treatment option. To test the effectiveness of oral administration of metformin, mice bearing tumors 10 days after
injection of the ER-Src cells were treated with 4 mg/kg
doxorubicin (4 cycles of intratumoral injection on days 10,
15, 20, and 25), 200 mg/mL metformin (in drinking water,
which corresponds to 15 mg/kg), or the combination. This
protocol involves continuous presence of metformin starting
at day 10, which differs from the original procedure in which
metformin treatment ceased after the last injection at 20 days.
In mice treated with doxorubicin alone, tumor growth was
suppressed until day 40, after which time, the tumor growth
resumed at rates near those observed for untreated control
mice (Fig. 1A). Mice treated with metformin alone had
reduced tumor growth in comparison with the untreated
mice, and after day 45, there was a mild regression of the
tumor. This level of regression is comparable to that achieved
by i.p injection of metformin at 20 mg/kg (10); injection of
metformin alone at 2.5 mg/kg had very little effect on tumor
formation (3). However, the combination of doxorubicin and
metformin not only suppressed tumor growth, but it prolonged remission with no detectable tumor for at least 65 days.
Similar results were obtained in xenografts generated by 2
genetically distinct breast cancer cell lines, BT-474 and MDAMB-231 (Fig. 1A; BT-474 was more sensitive to doxorubicin

starting at day 10 or both. Tumor volume was monitored 65 days after injection. B, percentage (mean  SD) of CD44high/CD24low cells (CSCs) from

C, CD44high/CD24low cells (CSCs), and CD44low/CD24high nonstem cancer cells (NSCC) purified from human mammary adenocarcinomas were treated with
metformin (0.1 mmol/L) for 48 hours or left untreated for the same amount of time. Data are presented as percentage of cell growth, which is determined by the
number of metformin-treated cells divided by the number of untreated cells at the 48-hour time point. D, number of mammospheres per 1,000 cells derived

alone, and metformin did not accelerate tumor regression in
MDA-MB-231). Thus, oral administration of metformin is
effective in combination with doxorubicin to accelerate tumor
regression (except in tumors derived from MDA-MB-231) and
prolong remission in xenografts involving a variety of breast
cancer cell lines.
Metformin selectively kills CSCs in human breast
tumors
Metformin selectively kills CD44high/CD24low cells (3),
which are commonly termed CSCs as defined by their ability
to form self-renewing mammospheres and cause tumor formation at high efficiency (3, 4, 16). We will use the term CSC to
refer to CD44high/CD24low cells throughout this work, even
though such cells can be generated by interleukin 6 (IL-6)
treatment of cancer cells and hence do not behave as classic
stem cells (19). In accordance with our previous experiments
involving i.p injection, oral administration of metformin
causes a decrease in the percentage of CSCs derived from
tumors at day 25, whereas doxorubicin alone has no effect
(Fig. 1B). Importantly, the combination of metformin and
doxorubicin further reduces the percentage of CSCs, indicating that therapeutic advantage of oral administration of
metformin is linked to its ability to inhibit CSC growth.
As is often the case for CSCs (1, 2), the CSCs examined here
are largely resistant to doxorubicin treatment (3). However,
the observation that the percentage of CSCs in the doxoru-

3198

Cancer Res; 71(9) May 1, 2011

bicin-treated mice is similar to that of untreated mice suggests
that doxorubicin effectively kills CSCs during tumor regression. We suggest that this apparent paradox is explained by
the dynamic equilibrium between CSCs and nonstem cancer
cells (NSCC) that occurs in cell culture and mouse xenografts
and is mediated by IL-6 secretion (19). Specifically, the percentage of CSCs is relatively constant because differentiation
of CSCs into NSCCs is balanced by IL-6â€“mediated conversion
of NSCCs to CSCs. Thus, doxorubicin directly kills NSCCs, and
this indirectly reduces the CSC population by preventing the
IL-6â€“mediated conversion.
Because our previous results involved CSCs isolated from
cancer cell lines, we examined whether metformin selectively
inhibits the growth of CSCs from human breast tumors. CSCs
(CD44high/CD24low) and NSCCs (CD44low/CD24high) were purified from human mammary adenocarcinomas and treated
with doxorubicin and/or metformin. As expected, metformin
preferentially kills CSCs over NSCCs derived from these human
breast tumors (Fig. 1C), and it inhibits growth of mammospheres derived from these tumors (Fig. 1D). Thus, metformin
selectively kills breast CSCs obtained from human cancer
patients. As shown previously (3), selective killing of CSCs
versus NSCCs is not absolute and depends on the metformin
concentration. However, selective killing of CSCs clearly occurs
at the metformin concentration used in xenograft experiments,
and this concentration is roughly comparable to what is used to
treat human patients with type 2 diabetes.

or with other biological therapies such as trastuzumab, a
HER2 monoclonal antibody (20, 21). As monotherapies, treatment of ER-Src and MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors with
paclitaxel (Fig. 2A) or carboplatin (Fig. 2B) suppressed
tumor growth but did not prevent relapse. At the concentrations used, these drugs were somewhat more effective than
doxorubicin, as relapse occurred after 55â€“60 days as opposed
to 50 days. Importantly, the combination of metformin with
either paclitaxel or carboplatin prolonged relapse, similarly
to that observed with doxorubicin. Thus, metformin-based
combinatorial therapy is effective with at least 3 different

Metformin works in combination with multiple
chemotherapeutic agents
According to the CSC hypothesis, combinatorial chemotherapy should be effective as long as one agent preferentially kills
CSCs, whereas the other agent preferentially kills NSCCs. In this
regard, metformin and miR-200 selectively inhibit CSCs, and
each of these agents prolongs remission in combination with
doxorubicin (3, 4). To address this issue in a reciprocal fashion,
we examined the effectiveness of metformin in combination
with paclitaxel or carboplatin, standard chemotherapeutic
drugs for treating breast cancer patients as monotherapies

chemotherapeutic drugs, suggesting that metformin would be
useful in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents
that primarily target NSCCs.
Metformin can reduce the dose of doxorubicin
necessary to prolong remission
Because chemotherapy is toxic and causes unwanted, and
often serious, side effects in cancer patients (5), a major
challenge is to lower the doses of chemotherapeutic drugs
without decreasing their effectiveness. We reasoned that the
combinatorial effect of metformin might permit the lowering
of the doxorubicin dose. In addition, because CSCs can
differentiate into NSCCs, metformin might indirectly lower
the NSCC burden by inhibiting CSCs. To test this idea, we
conducted oral, metformin-based combinatorial therapy in
xenografts involving 3 different breast cancer cell lines using a
4-fold reduced concentration of doxorubicin from previous
experiments (1 mg/kg instead of 4 mg/kg). As expected, the
reduced dose of doxorubicin alone is less effective, as tumor
growth was slowed compared with untreated control mice,
but tumor regression was not observed (Fig. 3). Nevertheless,
the combination of metformin with this reduced dose of
chemotherapy resulted in complete tumor regression and
no detectable relapse for at least 65 days. Indeed, in the
presence of metformin, the lowered dose of chemotherapy
was equally as effective as the higher dose. These preclinical

Metformin-based combinatorial therapy is effective in
xenografts generated with breast, prostate, and lung
cancer cell lines
Because our results have been confined to breast cancer
cells, we examined whether metformin-based combinatorial
therapy would be effective in other cancer types. Indeed,
combinatorial treatment of metformin and doxorubicin
suppresses growth of prostate (PC3) and lung adenocarcinoma (A549) xenografts tumors, and inhibits their relapse
(Fig. 4A and 4B). Tumor regression upon treatment is
modestly accelerated by the combination of metformin
and doxorubicin, with a slightly more pronounced effect
observed with the higher doxorubicin dose than the lower
dose. However, the absence of relapse due to metformin
treatment was comparable at both doses of doxorubicin for
the time frame of the experiment.

Discussion
Our preclinical studies in mouse xenografts indicate that
oral administration of metformin together with widely used
chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and
carboplatin is highly effective in blocking tumor growth and
preventing relapse in a variety of cancer cell types. In addition,
metformin is effective in combination with reduced dosages of
doxorubicin (and presumably other standard chemotherapeutic drugs), and hence seems to increase the effectiveness of
standard chemotherapy. Because metformin functions in the
context of breast cancer cell xenografts by selectively killing
breast CSCs, our results suggest the possibility that it might
preferentially inhibit highly tumorigenic (CSC-like) cells in
other developmental lineages. Our observations indicate that
metformin has broad anticancer effects of potential utility in a
wide variety of clinical contexts both for cancer treatment and
lowering the toxicity associated with standard chemotherapy.
Because metformin is a long-approved drug with an excellent
safety record, clinical tests of these preclinical observations
are practical and of potential medical significance for some
(and perhaps many) types of cancer.
