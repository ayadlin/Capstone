BACKGROUND. Gemcitabine incorporation into DNA enhances cleavage complexes in vitro when combined with topoisomerase I inhibitors and demonstrates
synergy in cancer cells when given with irinotecan. Topoisomerase I inhibitors
require that topoisomerase I interacts with DNA to exert activity.

METHODS. Patients who had received previous anthracycline therapy or were not
candidates for anthracycline therapy received gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2
intravenously over 30 minutes followed by irinotecan at a dose of 100 mg/m2
over 90 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. The primary endpoint was
improvement in response from that historically observed with gemcitabine (from
25% to 45%) as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Correlative studies included characterization of cellular levels and nuclear distribution of topoisomerase I and pharmacokinetic analysis of gemcitabine and

irinotecan.

RESULTS. Forty-nine patients were assessed for response. The response rate was
approximately 25% (all partial responses [PRs], 12 patients; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 13-39). Six patients had stable disease (SD) for 6 months for a
clinical benefit rate (PR 1 SD) of 39%. The median time to disease progression
was 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.5 months-4.6 months), and median survival was 11.6
months (95% CI, 8.9 months-15 months). Toxicities included neutropenia, nausea, and vomiting. Seven of 9 tissue biopsies were assessable for topoisomerase I.
Tumors with the 2 lowest nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios demonstrated no
response to irinotecan.

CONCLUSIONS. Gemcitabine and irinotecan are active in metastatic breast cancer,
but response did not meet predetermined response parameters, and the null hypothesis was accepted. Topoisomerase I localization can be measured in metastatic breast cancer. Further validation is needed to determine whether this assay
can predict response. Cancer 2008;113:2646–54.  2008 American Cancer Society.

agents in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
Both gemcitabine and irinotecan exert their cytotoxic
effects by interacting with genomic DNA. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue whose incorporation
into DNA inhibits DNA polymerase during replication or repair. Irinotecan inhibits topoisomerase I
(topo I), an essential enzyme for eukaryotic DNA
replication.1-3 Stabilization of topo I-DNA cleavage
complexes with topo I inhibitors, such as camptothecin or irinotecan, interferes with advancing replication or transcription forks, resulting in DNA-strand
breaks and cell death.4 Preclinical data indicate that
the incorporation of gemcitabine into DNA enhances
camptothecin-induced topo I cleavage complexes in
vitro.5 In addition, the incorporation of gemcitabine
slowed the kinetics of reversal for camptothecininduced cleavage complexes, which may increase the
frequency of collisions with replication and transcription complexes, leading to increased strand
breaks and improved cytotoxic activity. Synergistic or
additive effects of combination therapy with gemcitabine and irinotecan have been demonstrated in
human breast and lung cancer cell lines.6,7
Inhibitors of topo I require enzyme interaction
with DNA for drug activity. Human topo I contains
an N-terminal domain that carries essential
sequences for nuclear localization.8 Although this Nterminal domain does not contribute to the enzyme’s
catalytic activity in vitro, it is very important for in
vivo activity, as the enzyme must enter the nucleus
to exert its function.9-11 Data have indicated that
mutations within the N-terminus of top1 result in
loss of nuclear localization and subsequent resistance to topoisomerase I inhibitors.12 Localization of
topo I can be determined using immunofluorescence
microscopy in patients with hematologic and solid
tumors.13,14 This technique can also be used quantitatively to measure total cellular levels of topo I as
well as levels within the nucleus and cytoplasm to
determine a nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, which may
be predictive of response to inhibitors of topo I.
At least 3 phase 1 studies have evaluated combination therapy with gemcitabine and irinotecan in
patients with solid tumors.15-17 Lima et al examined
a dosing schedule of Days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks, in
patients with solid tumors.16 Grade 4 diarrhea was
the dose-limiting toxicity, and the recommended
dosing for phase 2 testing was gemcitabine at a dose
of 1000 mg/m2 and irinotecan at a dose of 100 mg/
m2. In the current study, 3 patients achieved a partial
response, 2 with pancreatic cancer and 1 with cancer
of an unknown primary site.
On the basis of these data, we performed a single-arm, phase 2 trial administering gemcitabine at a

2647

dose of 1000 mg/m2 followed by irinotecan at a dose
of 100 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day treatment
cycle to determine the efficacy in patients with metastatic breast cancer who had disease progression or
were not candidates for anthracycline-based chemotherapy. We hypothesized that the combination therapy would improve the response rate historically
noted with single-agent gemcitabine in this patient
population from 25% to 45%. We also measured topo
I localization using immunofluorescence microscopy
in patient samples obtained by fine-needle aspiration
(FNA) before the initiation of therapy to determine
whether this ratio could be used to predict response
to therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
Eligible male or female patients were age 18 years
with metastatic cancer; histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast (stage IV) who were not
candidates for or had documented disease progression during anthracycline-based chemotherapy
(including the adjuvant setting); had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2;
were free of prior malignancies for >5 years with the
exception of curatively treated basal or squamous
cell carcinomas of the skin or carcinoma in situ of
the cervix; had adequate hepatic, renal, and hematologic function; and had measurable disease by
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) criteria. Patients were excluded if they had
received >3 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic breast cancer, had untreated or uncontrolled
brain metastasis, or had received prior gemcitabine
or irinotecan.
Study Design and Treatment
This study was conducted in accordance with the US
Food and Drug Administration, the institutional
review board and clinical research committee, and
the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided
informed consent before study participation.
Patients received gemcitabine at a dose of 1000
mg/m2 in 250 mL of normal saline intravenously
over 30 minutes followed by irinotecan at a dose of
100 mg/m2 in 500 mL dextrose 5% in water over 90
minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day treatment cycle.
Dosing continued every 3 weeks with no maximum
number of cycles. Patients received therapy unless
there was evidence of progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent for further
therapy. Dose reductions were allowed based upon
treatment tolerability. No additional anticancer treat-

ments, such as endocrine therapies or anti-HER-2/
neu therapies, were administered while the patients
were receiving protocol treatment.
All supportive measures consistent with optimal
patient care were given throughout the study, including antiemetics, bisphosphonate therapy (for patients
with bone metastasis), and growth factor support for
prophylaxis after a documented episode of febrile
neutropenia. The administration of atropine and
loperamide was allowed for the treatment of irinotecan-induced diarrhea. Loperamide was supplied to
patients without charge, and patients were instructed
to begin therapy at the first sign of diarrhea.

Response Assessment
The primary objective of this study was to assess the
clinical activity of the combination therapy as measured by tumor response rate. Tumor response evaluation (by physical exam and/or imaging studies)
was performed after every 2 cycles of therapy using
RECIST criteria. Best overall response was evaluated
by the treating physician and not subject to review
by an independent review committee. Patients were
considered eligible for response evaluation if they
completed 1 cycle of therapy.
Toxicity Assessment
Toxicity was evaluated continuously. Hematologic
and serum chemistry evaluations occurred before the
administration of each dose of therapy and as clinically indicated. All patients who received at least 1
dose of therapy were evaluated for toxicity using the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 2.0).
Statistical Methods
This was a single-arm, phase 2 trial comparing combination therapy with the historical response rate of
25%18 noted with single-agent gemcitabine. The
study involved a 2-stage design, with the initial stage
accruing 26 response-assessable patients. If 6
patients met response criteria, accrual continued
until a total of 49 response-assessable patients were
enrolled. If >17 patients responded, the null hypothesis would be rejected, and the combination therapy
would be worthy of further study in a randomized
phase 3 trial. The probability of erroneously concluding that the treatment is active (P  .45) when it is
actually ineffective (P  .25) is less than .04 (alpha 5
.04). The probability of erroneously concluding that
the treatment is ineffective (P  .25) when the treatment is actually effective (P  .45) is less than .1
(power 5 90%).

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics
were summarized using descriptive statistics.
Response rate and its 95% exact confidence interval
(CI) were estimated using the binomial distribution.
Toxicity events were summarized by grades with frequencies and percentages.
Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate overall survival, time to tumor progression, and time to
treatment failure with their 95% CIs. Survival time
was defined as time between registration and death.
Time to tumor progression was defined as the time
between registration and disease progression. Time
to treatment failure was defined as time between
registration and discontinuation of therapy for any
reason. Response duration was defined as the time
from randomization to the time of progressive disease in patients who received at least a partial
response to therapy.

Correlative Studies
In patients who gave consent for optional tumor
biopsies, FNA was performed before initiation of protocol therapy. Tumor cells were suspended in 10 mL
of RPMI-1640 and 10% fetal bovine serum. After lowspeed centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in
phosphate-buffered saline and counted. Cytospin
slides were created using 2 3 105 cells/slide. Slides
were examined by a collaborating pathologist to verify the presence of breast cancer cells, then topo I
localization and cellular enzyme levels were determined using immunofluorescence as previously
described.14 Quantification of topo I was performed
on 50 randomly selected tumor cells/sample using
the Smart Capture program with measurements confirmed by Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems, San
Jose, Calif). Each compartment was quantified separately in pixels, and nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios were
calculated individually for each cell. These analyses
were performed in a single laboratory by collaborating investigators blinded to patient outcome.
Gemcitabine Pharmacokinetics
Serial blood samples were collected in heparinized
tubes predose, at 15 minutes and 30 minutes (during
infusion) and at postinfusion times of 45, 60, 90, and
120 minutes on Day 1 and at 24 hours on Day 2 of
the first cycle only. Blood samples (10 mL) were
drawn from a catheter contralateral to that used for
drug infusion and placed in a heparinized tube containing 5 lM of the cytidine deaminase inhibitor, tetrahydrouridine. Samples were placed in an ice bath
immediately after being obtained. Plasma was separated from all blood samples by centrifugation (400 g
for 5 minutes at 48C) and stored at 2208C until

Gemcitabine and Irinotecan in Breast CA/Moulder et al

assayed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as previously described.19 Gemcitabine
along with its deaminated metabolite dFdU were
determined by the assay. Calculation of the pharmacokinetic variables Cmax (highest drug concentration
observed in plasma), t1/2 (terminal plasma half-life),
clearance, and area under the concentration time
curve (AUC) was performed by noncompartmental
analysis with the pharmacokinetic software WinNonlin (version 1.5; Scientific Consulting Inc/Pharsight
Corp, Mountain View, Calif).

Irinotecan Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples were collected at predose and then 3,
3.5, 11, and 11.5 hours postdose. Blood samples (10
mL) were drawn from a catheter contralateral to that
used for drug infusion and also placed in heparinized
tubes. Plasma was separated from whole blood using
standard techniques. Irinotecan and its major metabolite SN38 were measured by HPLC using previously described methods.20,21 A limited sampling
strategy was applied for the prediction of the total
AUC for both irinotecan and SN38.22

RESULTS
Patients
Fifty-three patients provided informed consent and
were enrolled between September 1, 2003 and January 30, 2006 at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center. One
patient did not meet eligibility requirements and did
not initiate therapy. Three patients only received
Cycle 1 Day 1 doses of therapy and were not considered evaluable for response as stipulated by the protocol. All of these patients withdrew consent for
further therapy after the first dose. As per protocol,
these 3 patients were included in the toxicity but not
the efficacy analysis.
The baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of the patients are described in Table 1.
Most patients had received prior anthracyclines
(83%) and/or taxanes (77%) as either adjuvant therapy or therapy for metastatic disease. A majority of
patients had also received prior chemotherapy for
metastatic disease. All HER-2/neu-positive patients
had received prior therapy with trastuzumab for
treatment of metastatic breast cancer. All hormonereceptor-positive patients had received prior endocrine therapy in either the adjuvant (62.5%) or metastatic (91.7%) settings. Twelve (50%) patients had
received prior endocrine therapy in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. Sixteen hormone-receptor-positive patients (66.7%) had received prior
tamoxifen, 23 (95.8%) had received prior therapy

with an aromatase inhibitor, and 14 (58.3%) had
received prior therapy with both.
Patients received a median number of 4 cycles of
therapy (range, 1 cycle -42 cycles). Forty-two patients
discontinued treatment because of disease progression or recurrence. One patient discontinued treatment because of toxicity after maintaining stable
disease for 8 cycles of therapy, and 9 patients discontinued drug treatment at their own request, most after maintaining stable disease for multiple cycles of
therapy.

Efficacy
The response rates for combination therapy with
gemcitabine and irinotecan are listed in Table 2. The
objective response rate was 25% (95% CI, 13-39),
with all responders achieving a partial response (PR).
The median duration of response was 5.7 months
(95% CI, 3.1 months-9.7 months).
In 18 patients (38%), stable disease was reported
as the best response. All of these patients received at
least 4 cycles of therapy (median, 6 cycles; range, 5
cycles-12 cycles). Seven patients had stable disease
for 6 months for a clinical benefit rate (PR 1 stable
disease 6 months) of 39%.
Three patients chose to discontinue protocol
therapy after Cycle 1, Day 1 of therapy. By including
these patients in an intent to treat analysis, the

response rate of the combination therapy would
decrease to 23%, and the clinical benefit rate would
decrease to 36%.
The median time to progression and time to failure for all patients (n 5 52) receiving combination
therapy was 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.5 months-4.6
months) (Fig. 1A) and 3.0 months (95% CI, 1.8
months-4.4 months) (Fig. 1B), respectively. The overall median survival was 11.6 months (95% CI, 8.9
months -15 months) (Fig. 1C).

Toxicity
Fifty-two patients were evaluable for toxicity. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were usually
low grade (Table 3) and manageable with supportive
care. The most frequent nonhematologic TRAEs
included fatigue and nausea/vomiting. Only 1 patient
experienced grade 3 diarrhea. Although 1 patient
developed grade 3 hypokalemia, the most common
metabolic laboratory abnormalities detected were
low-grade elevations in transaminases, aspartate
aminotransferase (21%), alanine aminotransferase
(31%), and alkaline phosphatase (12%). No treatment-related fatal or life-threatening events occurred
during protocol participation. One patient with a history of malignant pleural effusions died during Cycle
1 of therapy because of worsening of her bilateral
pleural effusions. Her death was attributed to progression of disease by the treating physician.
Grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicity was commonly observed and included neutropenia (grade 3
in 33% of patients and grade 4 in 8% of patients),
anemia (grade 3 in 6% of patients and grade 4 in 0%
of patients), and thrombocytopenia (grade 3 in 4% of
patients and grade 4 in 0% of patients). No patients
developed febrile neutropenia while receiving protocol therapy.

Correlative Studies
Nine (17%) patients consented to FNA of tumors
before the initiation of therapy. Of these samples, 7
were evaluable for topo I localization. Total cellular
levels of topo I varied widely among patient samples
(Table 4) and did not appear to correlate with
response to therapy. The 2 lowest levels of nuclear to
cytoplasmic (N/C) ratios were associated with disease progression, and the highest N/C ratio with
clinical response; however, the sample size was too
small to adequately correlate topo I localization with
treatment response.

Gemcitabine and irinotecan pharmacokinetic
analyses were performed in 10 patients. For gemcitabine, the mean Cmax value of 37  23 lg/mL was
slightly higher than literature suggests, but occurred
between 15 and 30 minutes after the start of infusion
as expected.23,24 The averages for AUC (0-t) of 18.7 
11.1 lg/hour/mL and AUC (inf) of 19.0  11.3 lg/
hour/mL were also slightly higher than the reported
values; this was likely because of the higher Cmax
values. However, gemcitabine decreased below quantifiable levels after 2 hours (mean t1/2 of 0.3  0.1

hours), and there was no evidence of gemcitabine after 24 hours in any of the patients sampled. The
mean clearance value was affected by these slightly
higher AUC values, as it was 123.6  66.1 L/hour
(2060 mL/min). This number is a similar, but slightly
lower clearance value than the 2550 mL/min
reported in the literature.23
The dFdU metabolite pharmacokinetic parameter estimates were also compared with literature
results. The mean characteristics were as follows:
Cmax 5 44  15 lg/mL, AUC(0-t) 5 369  79.9 lg/
hour/mL, and AUC(inf) 5 415  85.6 lg/hour/mL.
The t1/2 was determined to be 8.4  1.3 hours, compared with literature containing individual values
ranging from 5 to 16 hours.23,24
The mean total AUC for irinotecan was calculated as 5640  996 ng/hour/mL, and mean clearance was 33.5  7.2 L/hour. The mean total AUC for
the major metabolite SN38 was determined to be 295
 68 ng/hour/mL.

DISCUSSION
Among the 49 patients evaluable for response to
therapy, 12 patients achieved PRs, for an objective
response rate of 25%. Although this study did not
meet statistical criteria for improvement of response
from 25% to 45% as originally stipulated, it did

2652

CANCER

November 15, 2008 / Volume 113 / Number 10

include a majority of patients previously treated with
both anthracyclines and taxanes. In such patient
populations, recently published clinical trials have
reported much lower response rates to single-agent
gemcitabine (range, 0%-29%; median, 17%).25-29 In
addition, 2 patients achieved PRs that remained
unconfirmed. One patient developed a PR after 6
cycles of therapy; however, at the time of response
confirmation, she developed symptoms of confusion
and headache. Magnetic resonance imaging of the
brain was suggestive of leptomeningeal disease, but
lumbar puncture was negative for malignancy. The
patient’s mental status continued to decline, and she
was placed into hospice care. Because of the possibility of disease progression within the central nervous system, the patient was not included as a
responder in the efficacy analysis. A second patient
also achieved a PR after 6 cycles of therapy, but subsequent scans failed to confirm this response. She
received an additional 6 cycles of therapy (12 in
total) before developing disease progression.
The combination of gemcitabine with irinotecan
was well tolerated, with 41% of patients experiencing
grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. This rate of neutropenia
was slightly lower that noted with gemcitabine given
in combination with taxanes (48%-85%) for the firstline treatment of metastatic breast cancer.30,31 Grade
3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (4%) and nausea/vomiting
(15%) occurred at rates similar to those observed
with single-agent gemcitabine therapy.32,33 Most
patients with nausea and vomiting responded to supportive care and the use of antiemetic prophylaxis
during subsequent cycles of therapy. It is interesting
to note that very few patients developed diarrhea,
with only 1 patient (2%) developing grade 3 diarrhea.
The low incidence of this toxicity is likely related to
the dosing schedule of irinotecan and the use of
loperamide as early treatment for diarrhea. Thirteen
(25%) patients tolerated prolonged (6 months)
administration of therapy, with 1 patient receiving
therapy for >31 months before developing disease
progression.
As would be expected given the toxicity data
described, there appeared to be minimal pharmacokinetic interaction between the 2 drugs, although the
study’s limited pharmacokinetic sampling design
cannot completely eliminate the possibility of a significant interaction. The pattern of the concentration-time profile for gemcitabine was similar to the
results of other studies conducted with a dose of
1000 mg/m2 with a 30-minute infusion. The mean
Cmax observed is more than enough to allow the production of the maximum amount of intracellular triphosphate levels according to the literature. The lack

of detectable gemcitabine after 24 hours concurs
with the previously reported mean elimination half
life (t1/2) of 18 minutes. This elimination was rapid
and clearly because of deamination to the major
metabolite dFdU.23 It is possible that these mean
estimates of Cmax, AUC, and clearance were affected
by 2 potential outliers in the data. Two of 10 patients
had reported Cmax values >50 lg/mL, yet appeared
to have very similar elimination rates when compared with the rest of the group. The average Cmax
for the metabolite dFdU was similar to known literature values. The dFdU AUC values for the group of
10 patients also fell within the range of reported
values by Abbruzzese et al.23
The limited sampling strategy model that was
previously validated for evaluating the irinotecan
pharmacokinetics was an acceptable predictor for
this study as well. The mean total AUC for both irinotecan and the active metabolite SN38 fell within
the range of published reports. These AUCs also correspond to the literature that suggests that the total
AUC of SN38 is approximately 100-fold less than that
of irinotecan, and therefore it does not appear that
the gemcitabine administration had any pharmacokinetic influence on irinotecan.34 The pattern of clearance of the parent compound also suggests the same
lack of influence on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan.
Although only a minority of patients underwent
optional tumor biopsies, we were able to characterize
cellular concentrations and localization of topo I in
the majority (78%) of collected samples. To our
knowledge, this is the first description of the expression and localization of topo I in human breast cancer. Our sample size was too small to definitively
correlate response with topo I localization, but interesting observations included a response in the
patient with the highest N/C ratio, and progression
of disease in the 2 patients with the lowest N/C
ratios. Such results should be further validated in
larger sample sets because assays of this type could
be of clinical importance with the increasing use of
topo I inhibitors for the treatment of metastatic
breast cancer and other types of malignancy.
In summary, although combination therapy with
gemcitabine and irinotecan did not reach the parameters required for statistical significance, this study
involved a number of pretreated patients, with the
majority having received prior therapy with anthracyclines and/or taxanes in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting. Whereas this study was designed to
determine the benefit of adding irinotecan to gemcitabine, work published by Perez et al suggests that
single-agent irinotecan administered weekly on a 4

Gemcitabine and Irinotecan in Breast CA/Moulder et al

out of 6-week schedule has considerable activity for
the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (response
rate of 23%).35 Thus, it is feasible that the benefits
noted in this study were related to the weekly administration of irinotecan rather than the combination
therapy. Notably, a higher incidence of grade 3 of 4
diarrhea was reported with single-agent irinotecan
administered on a 4 out of 6-week schedule compared with that reported herein in combination with
gemcitabine (17% vs 2%). It is also uncertain if a 2 of
3-week administration schedule of single-agent irinotecan would have similar efficacy without the addition of gemcitabine.
With the increasing use of taxanes in the adjuvant setting, further investigation into nontaxanebased regimens should be contemplated for the firstline treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In addition, combination chemotherapy and chemotherapy/
biotherapy regimens have, for the most part, demonstrated improved response compared with singleagent therapy and should be considered in patients
with symptomatic metastasis or significant visceral
organ involvement. Taken together, the preclinical
rationale, favorable toxicity profile, reasonable
response, and clinical benefit rate noted in this clinical trial suggest that the combination of gemcitabine
with irinotecan is a feasible option for the treatment
of patients with metastatic breast cancer.
