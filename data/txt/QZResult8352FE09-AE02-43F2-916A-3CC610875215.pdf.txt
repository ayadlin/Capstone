ABSTRACT
Here we found that levels of cathelicidin, an antimicrobial peptide, were increased
in colon cancer tissues compared to noncancerous tissues. Importantly, cathelicidin
was mainly expressed in immune cells. Contact with tumor cells caused macrophages
to secrete cathelicidin. Neutralization of cathelicidin, in vivo, significantly reduced the
engraftment of macrophages into colon tumors, as well as proliferation of tumor cells,
resulting in an inhibition of tumor growth. Furthermore, treatment with cathelicidin
neutralizing antibody de-activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in tumor cells
both in vivo and in vitro. Cathelicidin activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling by inducing
phosphorylation of PTEN, leading to activation of PI3K/Akt signaling and subsequent
phosphorylation of GSK3β, resulting in stabilization and nuclear translocation of
β-catenin. These data indicate that cathelicidin, expressed by immune cells in the
tumor microenvironment, promotes colon cancer growth through activation of the
PTEN/PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways.

domain and an LL-37 peptide [7]. The LL-37 peptide
is maintained in its pro-peptide form until secretion by
cleavage of protease3 [7, 8]. CAMP is constitutively
expressed by specialized host defense cells, including
macrophages, neutrophils, epithelial cells of the skin,
and endothelial cells on the gastrointestinal, urinary
and respiratory tracts [6, 9]. The Camp gene codes for
the cathelicidin-related AMP (CRAMP) peptide in
mice, which is similar to the LL-37 peptide in humans.
Both have α-helical structures, antimicrobial functions
and analogous tissue distribution [6, 7]. In addition to
combating microorganisms, cathelicidin plays a role in
various immune functions, including immune modulation,
inflammatory reactions, cell proliferation, angiogenesis
and inhibition of apoptosis [8, 10].

INTRODUCTION
Clinical evidence indicates that chronic
inflammation is linked with cancer development [1]. For
instance, ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel
disease that is associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) [2].
Emerging evidence indicates that numerous soluble factors
secreted by infiltrating immune cells contribute to cancer
growth, including the growth and progression of CRC [1,
3–5]; however, the actual role of these molecules in tumor
promotion is poorly understood.
The human cathelicidin gene, CAMP, is isolated
from human cells and codes for human cationic
antimicrobial peptide-18 (hCAP-18) [6]. HCAP18
consists of 3 domains: a signal peptide, a cathelin

Emerging evidence suggests that cathelicidin is
involved in the promotion of tumor growth [11, 12]. Upregulation of LL-37 has been observed in human lung
cancer and administration of synthetic and biologically
active LL-37 peptide, or transgenic expression of LL37 in tumor cells increases lung tumor cell proliferation
[9]. Knockdown of Camp in myeloid cells decrease the
tumor proliferation and inflammatory cell recruitment of
in a murine lung cancer model [6]. In ovarian cancer, LL37 contributes to cell proliferation, invasion and cancer
progression through direct stimulation of tumor cells,
initiation of angiogenesis and recruitment of immune
cells [7, 13, 14]. Surprisingly, it has been reported that
the expression of LL-37 was downregulated and treatment
with LL-37 caused cell-cycle arrest and tumor cell
apoptosis in gastric adenocarcinomas [15].
In this study, we collected human colon cancer
tissues and established colon cancer mouse models. We
aimed to examine the expression of cathelicidin and its
pathogenic effects in the colon cancer, and identify the
underlying molecular mechanisms.

hCAP-18/LL-37 were evaluated in patients with colon
cancer, both before and after surgery, to determine whether
the higher level of hCAP-18/LL-37 seen in patients with
colon cancer was due to the presence of tumors. Patients
had significantly decreased levels of cathelicidin in the
blood 1 month after surgery compared to before surgery
(Fig. 1D). These results are consistent with those obtained
by immunohistochemical analysis of human colon tumor
tissue.

Macrophage-derived cathelicidin accelerates the
growth of colon cancer cells in vitro
It has been well established that human cathelicidin
LL-37 acts as a growth factor for human lung cancer and
ovarian cancer cells [6, 7]. Based on the above data, it was
hypothesized that cathelicidin may induce proliferation
in colon cancer cell lines. The colon cancer cell lines,
HCT116 and SW480, were incubated with different
concentrations of LL-37; epidermal growth factor (EGF)
was used as a positive control. The cell lines were treated
for 96 h and a BrdU ELISA cell proliferation assay was
subsequently performed. The proliferation of both colon
cancer cell lines significantly increased after treatment
with LL-37 at doses ranging from 50 ng/ml to 1 μg/ml
(Fig. 2A). Cell proliferation was promoted at doses as low
as 50 ng/ml, whereas cell proliferation decreased at higher
doses (5 μg/ml to 50 μg/ml) (Fig. 2A).
An anchorage-independent colony formation assay
was done to determine whether LL-37 promotes the
ability of soft agar colony formation in colon cells. LL37 significantly increased the ability of both colon cancer
cell lines to grow in soft agar (Fig. 2C, 2D). The above
experiments were repeated using the mouse colon cancer
cell line, Colon-26. Colon-26 cells were treated with
different doses of CRAMP (murine cathelicidin). Results
were very similar to those obtained in human colon
cancer cell lines treated with LL-37. CRAMP increased
cell proliferation and colony formation in Colon-26 cells
(Fig. 2B, 2C, 2E). Collectively, these results indicate
that exogenous cathelicidin stimulates colon cancer cell
proliferation and promotes anchorage-independent growth.
Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells in the tumor
region expressed remarkably higher levels of hCAP18/
LL-37, compared with tumor cells. Ex vivo tissue
co-culture models were made, using human peripheral
blood monocyte-derived macrophages and SW480
cells, in order to dissect the expression of cathelicidin.
Coincubation of macrophages with SW480 cells induced
hCAP18/LL-37 mRNA and protein (pro-LL-37 and
cleaved LL-37) expression in macrophages, whereas
hCAP-18/LL-37 expression in SW480 cells remained
unchanged (Fig. 3A, 3B). In addition, hCAP18/LL-37
mRNA and protein expression was higher in macrophages
than in SW480 cells (Fig. 3A, 3B). These results indicate
that macrophages, and not SW480 cells, contribute to

RESULTS
Expression of cathelicidin in human colon cancer
tissue
Human colon tumor samples were analyzed
by immunohistochemistry. Sections of noncancerous
colon tissue showed weak staining for hCAP-18/LL-37;
however, colon cancer tissue sections showed strongly
positive staining for hCAP-18/LL-37. A total of 60/68
(88.2%) colon cancer tissue samples were positively
stained (Fig. 1A, a–d). Interestingly, the expression of
hCAP-18/LL-37 in tumor cells and colonic epithelial cells
was considerably weak and almost un-measurable, whereas
infiltrating inflammatory immune cells in the stroma
expressed remarkably higher levels of hCAP-18/LL-37
(Fig. 1A, a–d). Macrophage infiltration in tumor tissue
from patients was examined via CD68 immunostaining.
There were few macrophages that were positive for CD68
in noncancerous colonic mucosa; however, there was a
large number of CD68-positive macrophages in tumor
regions (Fig. 1A, e–h). In addition, the number of cells
that were positive for the proliferation marker, Ki-67 was
higher in tumor tissue than in noncancerous colon tissue
(Fig. 1A, i–l, 1B). These data indicate that hCAP-18/LL37 is highly expressed in human colon cancer and that
infiltrating inflammatory immune cells are the main source
of hCAP-18/LL-37 in tumor tissue.
Serum levels of hCAP-18/LL-37 were also
measured in patients diagnosed with colon cancer.
Consistent with the changes in expression of hCAP-18/
LL-37 in tumor regions, the concentration of hCAP-18/
LL-37 in the serum was much higher in patients with colon
cancer than in healthy humans (Fig. 1C). Blood levels of

(Fig. 3D). As expected, addition of the neutralizing
hCAP18/LL-37 antibody (anti-LL-37) to the co-culture
significantly inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells
(Fig. 3D). Silencing of hCAP18/LL-37 in U937 cells, a
human macrophage-like cell line, via short hairpin RNA
(shRNAs), significantly reduced the proliferation of
SW480 cells (Fig. 3E, 3F). These findings suggest that
LL-37 plays a direct role in promoting colon tumor cell
proliferation and indicate that this peptide is required for
promotion of cancer cell proliferation by macrophages.

(data not shown). Macrophage infiltration was observed in
mouse tumor tissue, whereas macrophages were sparsely
scattered in noncancerous mouse tissue, similar to results
found in human cancerous and noncancerous tissues,
respectively (Fig. 4C). CRAMP was highly expressed in
the cytoplasm of infiltrating immune cells of the stroma
(Fig. 4C). In contrast, there was a complete loss of
CRAMP expression in colon tumor cells (Fig. 4C). These
results were confirmed by immunoblot analysis and realtime PCR for CRAMP, in which the levels were found
to be remarkably higher in tumor tissues (Fig. 4D, 4E).
Importantly, CRAMP protein and CRAMP mRNA were
also strongly expressed in macrophages that had been
isolated from colon tumor tissue (Fig. 4F, 4G). Eighty days
after treatment with AOM plus DSS, CRAMP neutralizing
antibody (anti-CRAMP), IgG control antibody or PBS
was administered to tumor-bearing animals for 30 days to
investigate whether CRAMP contributes to colon cancer
growth. Anti-CRAMP significantly reduced the number of
macroscopic colon nodules and reduced maximal tumor
size compared with the IgG control antibody and PBS (Fig.
5A, 5B). The tumor load in the colons of mice treated with
anti-CRAMP was much lower compared to the

expression of mouse cathelicidin (CRAMP) was higher in
colonic tissues and the level of CRAMP was higher in
the blood after exposure to DSS (Fig. 4A, 4B). All mice

colons of mice treated with IgG or PBS (Fig. 5C). The
proliferation of tumor cells was then examined via
immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67. Consistent
with the changes in colon tumor burden, the number of
cells expressing Ki-67 was significantly lower in tumors
from mice treated with anti-CRAMP compared to mice
treated with IgG or PBS (Fig. 5D, 5E). TUNEL staining
was performed to determine whether the blocking
of CRAMP had an impact on tumor cell apoptosis.
There was no significant difference in colon tumor cell
apoptosis between the group treated with anti-CRAMP
and the group treated with IgG or PBS (Fig. 5E). Thus,
cathelicidin appears to play a critical role in the promotion
of colon tumor growth, most likely through stimulating
the proliferation of malignant cells. In addition, the
macrophage infiltration into colon tumors was much lower
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in mice treated with anti-CRAMP than in mice treated
with IgG or PBS (Fig. 5E), indicating that cathelicidin
plays a critical role in directing immune cells into tumor
tissues.

Wnt/β-catenin signaling mediates tumor growth
promoted by cathelicidin
As Wnt/β-catenin signaling mediates tumor
proliferation [3], we examined β-catenin phosphorylation
in the colon cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, the
protein level of unphosphorylated β-catenin in the
human colon cancer cells was significantly higher than
that in noncancerous control tissues (60/68 cases had
positive tumors). The accumulation of unphosphorylated
β-catenin was corresponding with the expression of

hCAP-18/LL-37 in tumor tissues (Fig. 1A). The tumor
tissues derived from mouse models that received antiCRAMP neutralizing antibody had markedly lower levels
of unphosphorylated β-catenin in tumor cells than the
control tissues derived from PBS or isotype IgG-treated
cancer mice (Fig. 6B). Similarly, the addition of HCAP18/
LL-37 neutralizing antibody significantly suppressed
the accumulation of unphosphorylated β-catenin in
SW480 cells, which were co-cultured with macrophages
(Fig. 6C). Moreover, the expression of β-catenin targeting
gene products, c-Myc and cyclin D1, in SW480 cells was
also reduced by anti-LL-37 (Fig. 6C).
GSK3β and Akt proteins are known to regulate Wnt/βcatenin signaling [3, 16]. GSK3β phosphorylation on Ser9
and Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 were significantly
increased in SW480 cells that had been treated with LL-37 for
4 h (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, the unphosphorylated β-catenin
was accumulated in association with the phosphorylation
of GSK3β and Akt (Fig. 7A). The application of the PI3K/
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Akt inhibitor, LY294002, inhibited the LL-37-induced
accumulation of unphosphorylated β-catenin, as well as the
phosphorylation of GSK3β in SW480 cells (Fig. 7B).
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor
suppressor negatively regulating PI3K/Akt signaling and
phosphorylation in the C terminus decreases stability
leading to more rapid degradedation by the proteasome
[17]. To test whether PTEN is involved in the regulation
of Akt activation by cathelicidin, we observed that
phosphorylation of PTEN at Ser380, Thr382 and Thr383
in cultured colon cancer cells could be induced by LL-37
exposure (Fig. 7A) or in cancer cells in the cancer animal
models (Fig. 7C). In the mouse model, anti-CRAMP
antibody treatment could block phosphorylation of all
PTEN, Akt and GSK3β (Fig. 7C). These results indicate
that inhibition of PTEN by phosphorylation could activate
PI3K/Akt signaling and subsequent GSK3β inhibition,
which in the end activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling and
promote the growth of colon tumor cells.

DISCUSSION

especially macrophages infiltrating the tumor, instead of
the tumor and colonic epithelial cells are the major source
of cathelicidin. This observation was confirmed by the
co-culture of macrophages and tumor cells, which showed
increased cathelicidin expression in macrophages, but not
in tumor cells. Our observation is also in line with an earlier
report on the lung cancer, in which sufficient macrophages
are recruited to tumor areas and secret cathelicidin [6].
However, our results are different from Cho group’s report
that the expression of cathelicidin in colon cancer was lower
than in noncancerous colon tissue and colonic epithelial
cells were the major cells expressing cathelicidin [20].

The infiltrating immune cells have formed the key part
of tumor microenvironment in the colon cancer. How these
immune cells affects tumor genesis still remains unclear [1,
18, 19]. Our study demonstrates that cathelicidin is strongly
expressed and secreted by the infiltrating macrophages
and significantly contributes to the growth of colon cancer
through activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cancer cells.
Our study observed dramatical expression of
cathelicidin in the cancerous colon tissue in both CRC
patients and CRC mouse models. The immune cells,

Cathelicidin was originally showed with its
antimicrobial activity. Cathelicidin shields from skin
and urogenital endothelium during infections and
protects against tuberculosis [8, 21, 22]. Recently,
cathelicidin LL-37 has been shown to be over-expressed
in lung, breast, ovarian and prostate cancers and showing
tumor-promoting effects [12, 23, 24]. In our study,
we demonstrated that the tumor-promoting effect of
cathelicidin was dose-dependent: i) cathelicidin at the
physiological level or even lower doses (1 μg/ml for
human colon cancer cells; 100 ng/ml for mouse colon
cancer cells) promoted tumor growth in cell culture; ii) the
inhibition of cathelicidin signaling in animal models by
neutralizing the endogenous cathelicidin with antibodies
reduced tumor growth; and iii) cathelicidin at higher
concentrations (LL-37: 50 μg/ml; or CRAMP: 1000 ng/
ml) killed the tumor cells, which could explained the
previous observations from Isogai [25] and Cho [20, 26]
that cathelicidin at high doses of (Isogai: 10 to 40 μg/ml
or Cho: 20 to 60 μmol/l) decreased the proliferation of
colon cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and autophagy.
Moreover, cathelicidin could serve as a chemokine of
inflammatory cells including monocytes, neutrophils and
macrophages [6, 27]. Thus, the expression of cathelicidin
in immune cells builds a positive feedback loop in
formation of the inflammatory tumor microenvironment.
The development of colon cancer has been related to
numerous genetic mutations and various altered signaling
pathways, including the Wnt signaling pathway [28]. In
colon cancer, increased β-catenin accumulation has been
observed in the invasive front of tumor [16]. In this study,
we demonstrated that LL-37 enhenced the Wnt/β-catenin
signaling in CRC tumor cells. β-catenin is the central
player in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the levels of
β-catenin are tightly regulated [29]. In the absence of
Wnt, cytoplasmic β-catenin is phosphorylated on several
serine and threonine residues by a destruction complex
containing glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), casein
kinase1 (CK1), axin and adenomatous polyposis coli
(APC), which leads to ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated
degradation of β-catenin [30, 31]. Upon binding of Wnt
engage their receptors on the cell surface, the destruction
complex including GSK3β is inhibited. As a result,
β-catenin is stabilized and enters the nucleus, where the
expressions of a broad range of target genes, such as
CyclinD1 and c-Myc, are modulated [31, 32]. A study
by Castellone et al. suggested a mechanism in which
inflammatory PGE2 increased unphosphorylated β-catenin
levels by phosphorylation of an inhibitory residue in
GSK3β, via Akt, in colon cells [33]. In the current
study, LL-37 treatment activated Akt in colon cancer
cells through a PI3K-dependent pathway. In turn, LL-37
inhibited GSK3β kinase activity by phosphorylating serine
9, and subsequently activated β-catenin. The possibility
that cathelicidin alters PTEN phosphorylation was
examined in order to further elucidate the mechanism by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

which cathelicidin activates Akt. PTEN is a major negative
regulator of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which
dominates the activation of Akt by dephosphorylating
PIP3 to generate PIP2 [34]. PTEN possesses a carboxyterminal noncatalytic regulatory domain containing three
phosphorylation sites (Ser380, Thr382 and Thr383),
which regulate its stability and have been implicated in
controlling PTEN activity [35]. In the present study, there
was a significant increase in PTEN phosphorylation in
SW480 colon cancer cells following stimulation by human
peptide, LL-37. Moreover, anti-CRAMP antibody was able
to inhibit the phosphorylation of PTEN, as well as Akt and
GSK3β in the mouse model. These results outline a novel
mechanism for the effects of cathelicidin in colon cancer
cells and the promotion of colon cancer growth through a
PTEN/PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling axis.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that
cathelicidin is upregulated in immune cells infiltrating
the colon cancer tissue. Cathelicidin promotes tumor
growth through activating PTEN/PI3K/Akt/Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway. Thus, our findings contribute
to a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of
tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and could offer a novel
molecular target for the colon cancer therapy.

The colitis-associated colon cancer model was
induced as described previously [36]. Briefly, on day 1,
mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 12.5 mg/
kg azoxymethane (AOM) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) and maintained on regular diet and water
for 5 days. After 5 days, mice received water with 2.5%
dextran sulfate sodium (DSS; molecular weight 35,000–
50,000 kDa; MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA)
for 5 days. After 5 days of treatment with 2.5% dextran
sulfate sodium, mice were maintained on regular water
for 14 days and then subjected to 2 more DSS treatment
cycles. On day 80, mice were injected with 10 mg/kg
i.p of nonspecific rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signalling
Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit anti-CRAMP
(Pineda-Antikörper-Service, Berlin, Germany) or PBS.
Antibodies or PBS were given every three days for
the duration of the experiment. On day 110, mice were
euthanized and the colons were removed and examined
histologically or by western blot. Macroscopic tumors
were counted and measured with a caliper. Mice were
euthanized after 5 days of 2.5% DSS or water treatment to
study the expression of CRAMP. The serum was used for
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis (ELISA).

centrifugation. PBMCs were allowed to adhere to culture
flasks for 1 h at 37°C in DMEM supplemented with 1%
human serum, after which the nonadherent cells were
removed by vigorous washing with PBS. Adherent cells
were cultured in 20 ml DMEM (10% FCS) supplemented
with 50 ng/ml macrophage colony stimulating factor
(M-CSF) (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) for 7 days
to allow differentiation to macrophages.

Isolation of macrophages from mouse tumors or
noncancerous colon tissues
Mouse primary macrophages were generated as
described previously [36]. Briefly, tissue was chopped into
small pieces and placed in 1 ml enzyme-mixture buffer (400
U/ml collagenase type IV, 0.05 mg/ml collagenase type I,
0.025 mg/ml hyaluronidase, 0.01 mg/ml DNase I, 0.2 U/
ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (all five from Sigma-Aldrich)
dissolved in DMEM + 10% FBS) and incubated for 2 h at
37°C. The mixture was then pipetted up and down with a
1 ml pipette to get an easily flowing single cell suspension.
The cell suspension was then centrifuged and the cell pellet
was resuspended in MACs buffer. Anti-CD11-microbeads
(5 μl beads/107 cells) were then added and the suspension
was incubated at 8°C for 15 min. CD11b+ cells were
purified on LS columns, using the MidiMACS system,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi
Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Cells were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 1 h
at 37°C. Non-adherent cells were removed by vigorous
washing with phosphate-buffered saline and the purity of
the prep was confirmed by morphology and staining with
macrophage specific marker, CD68.

Cell culture
The human colon cancer cell lines, HCT116 and
SW480, the mouse colon cancer cell line, Colon-26
and the human macrophage-like cell line, U937, were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
Cells were cultured in Dulbeccos’s modified Eagles
medium (DMEM) (Hyclone laboratories. Inc, South, UT,
USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin
and 100 U/ml streptomycin (Hyclone laboratories. Inc.).
Cell cultures were performed at 37°C in humidified air
with 5% CO2. For monocytic differentiation, U937
cells were cultured in the presence of 10 nM phorbol12myristat-13acetat (Sigma-Aldrich) for 48 h. The
PI3K/Akt inhibitor, LY294002 (10 μM, Cell Signaling
Technology) was added as indicated, 1 h before LL-37
(Invivogen, San Diego, CA, USA) stimulation.

Co-cultivation of colon cancer cells and
macrophages
For coculture studies with cancer cells and
macrophages, cancer cells were seeded into the bottom
of multi-well cell culture plates and macrophages were
placed in transwell inserts (0.4 μm, Corning Incorporated,
Corning, NY, USA) with a membrane permeable for
liquids, but not for cells. Cells were incubated overnight
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The transwells
were inserted into the wells of a multi-well culture plate
and cultured for the indicated time. Neutralizing antibody
(Clone # mAb 3D11, Hycult Biotech, The Netherlands)
was added at 2 μg/ml for hCAP18/LL-37 neutralization.

Generation of human peripheral blood
monocytederived macrophages
Institutional approval from the local research
ethical committees (Internal Review and the Ethics
Boards of the Tongji Hospital, Tongji University) was
obtained prior to conducting the study. Human peripheral
blood monocyte-derived macrophages were generated as
previously described [6]. Briefly, human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy blood donors
from the blood bank of the Tongji Hospital of Tongji
University were isolated from buffy coats by FicollPaque PLUS (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) density

BrdU ELISA cell proliferation assay
Colon cancer cell proliferation was determined
using a commercially available Cell Proliferation ELISA,
BrdU (colorimetric) Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), as
previously described [7]. For cathelicidin stimulation, the
cells were stimulated with 0-50 μg/ml LL-37 (Invivogen)

Oncotarget

or 0-1000 ng/ml CRAMP (AnaSpec, Fremont, CA, USA)
for 96 h; human EGF (hEGF) (Invitrogen) or mouse EFG
(mEGF) (Invitrogen) was used as control. For coculture
experiments, after 4 days coculture with macrophages,
transwell inserts (containing macrophages) were removed,
tumor cell supernatants were aspirated and growth media,
containing 10 μM BrdU, was added. Tumor cells were
incubated for an additional 2 h at 37°C, after which cell
proliferation was measured.

Real time PCR reaction mixtures have been described
previously [3]. Briefly, cDNA was synthesized by reverse
transcription reaction using the First Strand cDNA
synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed
using the QPCR SYBR Green Mix (Bio-Rad) on an
AB 7300 Real time PCR system machine (AB Applied
Biosystems, Singapore). The following PCR primers
were used: human β-actin, 5′-AGCCTCGCCTTTGCC­
GA-3′
and
5′-CTGGTGCCTGGGGCG-3′;
mouse
β-actin,
5′-AGCCTCGCCTTTGCCGA3′
and
5′-CTGGTGCCTGGGGCG-3′;
hCAP18/
LL-37,
5′-TGGGCCTGGTGATGC
CT-3′
and
5′-CGATGTTCCTTCGACAGGAAGC-3′;
mouse
CRAMP, 5′-AATTTT CTTGAACCGAAAGGGC-3′ and
5′-TGTTTTCTCAGATCCTTGGGAGC-3′. Specificity of
RT-PCR was controlled by ‘no reverse transcription’ controls
and melting curve analysis. Quantitative PCR results were
obtained using the DDCT (cycle threshold) method. Data
were normalized to β-actin levels in each sample.

Anchorage-independent colony formation assay
24-well plates were precoated with 0.8ml of
0.5% (w/v) agar containing 10% (v/v) FBS as a bottom
layer. Cell lines were suspended in 0.6 ml 0.3% (w/v)
agar containing 10% (v/v) FBS and plated onto the
bottom layer. Cathelicidins were used at the indicated
concentrations in the media. Colony forming efficiency
was determined 2 to 3 weeks after plating and cultivation
in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. The colonies
were visualized after staining with 0.005% crystal violet.

Immunohistochemical analyses
Immunohistochemistry was performed as described
before [6]. The following primary antibodies were used
for immunohistochemical analysis: mouse anti-Ki-67
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit anti-CD68 (for mouse,
Abbiotec, San Diego, CA, USA), mouse anti-CD68
(Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA), rabbit anti-CRAMP
(Pineda-Antikörper-Service, Berlin, Germany), rabbit
anti- hCAP18/LL-37 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
mouse anti-unphosphorylated β-catenin (Millipore,
Temecula, CA, USA). Secondary antibody incubation and
staining were performed using the EnVision®+ System–
HRP (DAB) kit (Dako), according to manufacturer’s
recommendations. TUNEL staining was performed using
the DeadEnd Colorimetric TUNEL System kit (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). The number of Ki-67-positive tumor
cells and the total number of tumor cells were enumerated
in six microscopic fields of a randomly selected tumor and
the mean value was calculated as the percentage of Ki-67positive tumor cells.

Small interfering RNA interference
Log growth U937 cells were washed 1 time
with PBS and resuspended at 2×107 cells/ml in 1 ml of
Gene Pulser electroporation buffer reagent (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA), mixed with 20 mg of LL-37 RNAi
plasmids or mock RNAi plasmids (both from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Electroporations
were performed using a Gene-Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 280 V
and 960 mF in 0.4 cm cuvette (Bio-Rad). The samples
were transferred to culture flasks containing complete
DMEM medium with 10% FCS in 25 cm2 and incubated
at 37°C in 5% CO2. After 48 h, the growth medium
was changed and puromycin (Invitrogen) was added at
a concentration of 5 mg/ml. The culture medium was
switched with fresh growth medium (containing 5 mg/
ml puromycin), every 4 days. After 4 weeks, positive
polyclonal populations (pools) were identified based on
western blot analysis for LL-37 expression. Individual
positive clones were eventually isolated via limiting
dilution analysis in 96-well plates.

Preparation of cell total protein extract and
western blotting

ELISA assay for cathelicidin

In all, 10mg of microdissected tumor tissue was
homogenized in 500 ml cell lysis buffer (Cell Signalling
Technology) using a rotor-stator homogenizer. Western
blot analysis was performed as described earlier [7].
Briefly, 30 mg total protein extracts were loaded on 10%
SDS polyacrylamide gels, subjected to electrophoresis,
and blotted onto Hybond-C Extra membranes (Amersham
Bioscience, Buckinghamshire, UK). The cell supernatants
were first concentrated to 1/10 of their original volume by
vacuum centrifugation and then subjected to 4–12% NU/
PAGE gradient gels (Invitrogen). Primary antibodies used
for western blot analysis included: mouse anti-cyclin D1,

Samples of serum from patients or mice were
analyzed by hCAP18/LL-37 or CRAMP ELISA (USCN
life science, INC. Houston, TX, USA), respectively,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

RNA isolation and real-time PCR
Total RNAs were isolated from microdissected
tumors and noncancerous colon tissues or cells, according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations, using an
RNeasy plus mini kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA, USA).
