Abstract
Aging is a major risk factor for progression of liver diseases to
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cellular senescence contributes to age-related tissue dysfunction, but the epigenetic basis
underlying drug-induced senescence remains unclear. macroH2A1,
a variant of histone H2A, is a marker of senescence-associated
heterochromatic foci that synergizes with DNA methylation to
silence tumor-suppressor genes in human ﬁbroblasts. In this
study, we investigated the relationship between macroH2A1
splice variants, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, and liver
carcinogenesis. We found that protein levels of both
macroH2A1 isoforms were increased in the livers of very elderly
rodents and humans, and were robust immunohistochemical
markers of human cirrhosis and HCC. In response to the
chemotherapeutic and DNA-demethylating agent 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), transgenic expression of macroH2A1 isoforms in HCC cell lines prevented the emergence of a senescent-

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most frequently
diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related
death worldwide. Prognosis is poor, as only 10% to 20% of
patients with HCC are eligible for surgery; without surgery, the
expected survival is less than 6 months (1). Aging is the major risk

like phenotype and induced synergistic global DNA hypomethylation. Conversely, macroH2A1 depletion ampliﬁed the
antiproliferative effects of 5-aza-dC in HCC cells, but failed to
enhance senescence. Senescence-associated secretory phenotype and whole-transcriptome analyses implicated the p38
MAPK/IL8 pathway in mediating macroH2A1-dependent
escape of HCC cells from chemotherapy-induced senescence.
Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
revealed that this hepatic antisenescence state also required
active transcription that could not be attributed to genomic
occupancy of these histones. Collectively, our ﬁndings reveal a
new mechanism by which drug-induced senescence is epigenetically regulated by macroH2A1 and DNA methylation and
suggest macroH2A1 as a novel biomarker of hepatic senescence
that could potentially predict prognosis and disease progression. Cancer Res; 76(3); 594–606. 2016 AACR.

the insurgence of cirrhosis (2). In agreement with the inﬂammaging theory, in which aging accrues inﬂammation, old age seems
to favor the progression of liver diseases toward HCC (2). In the

DNA Hypomethylation and macroH2A1 Synergism in HCC

capacity and preserved functional performance during aging (2).
Nevertheless, the aging process increases the risk of hepatic
functional and structural impairment and metabolic risk. In this
respect, mouse models of metabolic syndrome with NAFLD reveal
features of accelerated aging, impaired regeneration, and an
increased incidence of HCC (2, 3). Interventions to clear senescent
hepatocytes in a neoplastic-prone tissue microenvironment delay
the emergence of HCC in rats (4). Cellular senescence can thus
regulate tumor suppression, as well as contribute to age-related
loss of tissue function through the secretion of multiple proinﬂammatory molecules, such as IL6 and IL8, as part of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP; ref. 5). Moreover,
changes in nuclear chromatin structure that occur during senescence are highlighted by the formation of punctate and visible
DNA foci in 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)–stained
senescent cells, known as senescence-associated heterochromatin
foci (SAHF; ref. 5). In vertebrates, histone variants provide continuous regulation of nucleosome turnover across the entire lifespan of the organism, in addition to being expressed in terminally
differentiated cells, and they are a chief cellular strategy to regulate
transcription and cellular metabolism. Speciﬁcally, the histone
H2A variant macroH2A1 is enriched in SAHF of senescent human
ﬁbroblasts (5), but its mechanistic role in cellular senescence is
poorly understood. macroH2A1 is composed of a domain 66%
homolog to histone H2A, and it stands out because of its unique
structure, whereby a C-terminal linker connects the histone fold
domain to a macro domain. This domain protrudes from the
compact structure of the nucleosome, likely affecting the function
and organization of the surrounding chromatin, and is conserved
in multiple functionally unrelated proteins throughout the animal kingdom. macroH2A1 exists as two alternatively exon-spliced
isoforms, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, which bind in vitro
with different afﬁnities to O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPR), a
small metabolite produced by the protein/histone deacetylase
SIRT1 (6). Historically, macroH2A1 has been implicated in X
chromosome inactivation and transcriptional repression: this
view has recently been challenged by reports that have linked
macroH2A proteins to signal-induced gene activation (7–9).
macroH2A1 isoforms have taken center stage in the plasticity of
stem cell differentiation and in the pathogenesis of many cancers,
providing an exciting, yet poorly understood, link to metabolism
and nutrients (10, 11).
In the liver, genome binding and transcriptomic studies using
knock-out (KO) mice have shown that macroH2A1 participates in
the pathogenesis of NAFLD and fat-induced obesity (12–18).
Moreover, increased expression of macroH2A1 isoforms in the
liver might be used as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for HCC
(3). In the aging murine and primate livers, we observed an
increased age-associated localization of macroH2A1 to regions
of pericentromeric heterochromatin (19). It is, however,
unknown whether increased expression of macroH2A1 during
aging could favor the onset of HCC, which is characterized by
profound epigenetic alterations, such as promoter-speciﬁc hypermethylation and global DNA hypomethylation (20). Hypomethylating agent 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC, decitabine)
and its derivatives inhibit DNA methyltransferases proteins and
are chieﬂy used for the treatment of nonsolid malignancies;
however, they also exert antitumor effects in HCC cells by inducing senescence (21–24). In human ﬁbroblasts, macroH2A1 deﬁciency combined with 5-aza-dC treatment activates tumor-suppressor genes and inhibits cell proliferation (25).

The aim of this study is to investigate the interplay between
macroH2A1 isoforms and DNA methylation during "healthy"
liver aging and hepatic carcinogenesis, using aged and KO rodent
models, macroH2A1-isoform speciﬁc transgenic HCC cell lines,
and human liver tissues.
A model emerged where macroH2A1 marks but does not affect
physiologic hepatic senescence. In the presence of HCC-associated or chemotherapy-induced DNA hypomethylation, high
levels of macroH2A1 might instead favor HCC progression
through a distinct p38 MAPK/IL8-dependent mechanism.

Materials and Methods
Animals
All mice in C57/BL6 background were housed in a clean,
temperature-controlled mouse facility on a 12-hour light/dark
cycle on a standard diet. Liver tissues from young (3 months)
and old (30 months) animals were provided by the European
Molecular Biology Laboratory, Monterotondo, Italy. Harvesting
procedures were approved by the local Ethical Committee (Monterotondo, Italy) and were in accordance with national and
European regulations. macroH2A1 KO mice were kindly provided
by Professor John Pehrson (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; ref. 26). Aged macroH2A1 KO mice were produced and
housed at Brown University in a speciﬁc pathogen-free Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care–certiﬁed barrier facility. Heterozygous animals were bred,
and macroH2A1 þ/þ and / littermates were retained for
further analysis. All procedures were approved by the Brown
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were euthanized using isoﬂuorane anesthesia, followed by
cervical dislocation. Liver tissue was rapidly removed, ﬂash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen or embedded in optimal cutting temperature
compound, and stored at 80 C.
Human biopsies and histology
Liver specimens were obtained from patients undergoing clinically indicated hepatic biopsies (27), with appropriate institutional ethical approval and patient consent and in accordance
with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). Liver parafﬁn-embedded sections (4-mmthick, 10 per condition) were stained with hematoxylin & eosin
(H&E) and Masson's trichrome for histologic evaluation, as
described previously (3, 28). Diagnostic classiﬁcation of NAFLD
and ﬁbrosis/cirrhosis was performed using a semiquantitative
scoring system that grouped histologic features into broad categories (steatosis, hepatocellular injury, portal inﬂammation,
ﬁbrosis, and miscellaneous features; ref. 29). Human healthy
liver samples from four old (72–81 years old) and four young
(33–48 years old) healthy subjects were obtained from OriGene.
Immunohistochemistry and X-gal staining
Sections from human liver specimens were processed by Masson trichrome staining for histologic evaluation. Immunostaining
on human biopsies and murine livers was performed using the
iVIEW DAB Detection Kit for the Ventana BenchMark XT–automated slide stainer. Primary antibodies for macroH2A1.1 and
macroH2A1.2 were previously generated (3). Anti-5-Methylcytosine (33D3) antibody was obtained from Active Motif (cat. no.
39649); anti-GLB1/Beta-Galactosidase Antibody (clone 5H2)
IHC-plus LS-B10217 was obtained from LSBio. macroH2A1.1,

macroH2A1.2, and anti-GLB1 primary antibodies were diluted
1:100; anti-5-Methylcytosine primary antibody was diluted
1:1,000. Positive and negative controls were run concurrently.
Means of triplicate counts were used for statistical analyses. For XGal staining of murine livers, frozen sections of 5-mm thickness
were used and processed as previously described (30). Slides were
counterstained with eosin, mounted with aqueous medium, and
observed with an optical microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE Ni) connected to a digital camera (DS-Fi2). The percentage of blue
staining, indicating b-galactosidase activity, was calculated in
10 random high-power ﬁeld (HPF) at 400 magniﬁcation and
expressed as means. Also, after performing quantitative analysis,
the results were expressed in a semiquantitative scale (: 0%; þ:
1%–33%; þþ: 34%–66%; þþþ: 67%–100%). All analyses were
performed in triplicate by three independent pathologists.
Constructs, cell cultures, and proliferation/migration assays
Stable differential expression of macroH2A1.1 or macroH2A1.2
isoforms tagged with GFP in HepG2 and in Huh-7 cells was
achieved by lentiviral transduction. cDNAs encoding macroH2A1
isoforms were placed under the control of a constitutive EF1a
promoter in the HIV1-based self-inactivating lentiviral vector,
modiﬁed to allow expression of macroH2A isoforms as N-terminal
fusions with a monomeric ﬂuorescent protein mTagGFP. Viral
preparations were produced by transient transfection in HEK293T
cells, and concentrated 100-fold by low-speed centrifugation
(6,000  g for 16 hours). HepG2 and Huh-7 cells were transduced
with virus at multiplicity of infection > 10 for 24 hours in
the presence of 4 mg/mL Polybrene. Stably transduced cell populations were established and used in subsequent experiments without clonal selection. To generate appropriate controls, cells
were also stably transduced with the empty vector (expressing
only mTagGFP) and maintained in similar culture conditions
to macroH2A1-expressing cells. For knock-down experiments,
HepG2 were transduced with retroviral macroH2A-speciﬁc shRNA
cassettes (31). Transient transfection of macroH2A1 isoforms in
mouse HCC Hepa1-6 cells was carried out as described (17).
HepG2 and Huh-7 cells were treated for 72 hours with 12
mmol/L of 5-aza-dC (decitabine; Sigma). For p38 MAPK activity
inhibition and IL8 receptor blockade, cells were concomitantly
treated with 10 mmol/L SB202190 or 10 mmol/L SB265610 (Sigma), respectively. Cell migration and cell proliferation were
assessed by wound-healing assay and by MTT assay respectively
as previously described (17, 32).
SASP analyses
sICAM, IL1b, IL6, and IL8 levels were assessed in HepG2 and
Huh-7 cell supernatants, upon treatment with 5-aza-dC and or
p38 MAPK/IL8 pathway chemical inhibitors, using a customized
human MILLIPLEX MAP (multi-analyte panels) Luminex system
(Merck Millipore; ref. 12), according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
b-galactosidase assay
The Senescence b-Galactosidase Staining Kit (Cell Signaling
Technology; #9860) was used in HepG2 and in Huh-7 cells to
evaluate b-galactosidase activity at pH 6, a known characteristic of
senescence, according to the manufacturer's instructions.
DNA methylation assay (LUMA)
LUMA was used to quantify genome-wide methylation levels in
cell lines and mouse liver (33). Genomic DNA was extracted using

596 Cancer Res; 76(3) February 1, 2016

a commercial kit (Qiagen). LUMA measures the percentage of
global methylation using the ratio of DNA cleavage by methylation-sensitive (HpaII) and methylation-insensitive (MspI)
restriction enzymes, followed by polymerase extension assay by
pyrosequencing to determine cleavage. The LUMA method was
validated using DNA controls of known human DNA methylation
status. Genome-wide methylation was expressed as a percentage
as previously described (33).
Gene expression
Total RNA was isolated from livers of mice or cells using TRIzol
(Invitrogen) and quantiﬁed using NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc). After RNA quality veriﬁcation, 1 to 2
mg was used to prepare cDNA. In Hepa1-6 HCC cells, Cellular
Senescence RT2 Proﬁler PCR Array proﬁles were assessed following the manufacturer protocol (SABioscience). Quantitative PCR
was performed using SYBR Green (SIGMA) in an ABI-PRISM
qPCR cycler (Applied Biosystems), as described previously
(34). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
transcript was used as internal control for normalization using
the 2-DDCT method. Primer sequences were as follows: GAPDH,
Forward CATGGCCTTCCGTGTTCCTA, Reverse GCGGCACGTCAGATCCA; GLB1, Forward TTTACGTGGGCAACTTCTC,
Reverse TACTTGACCCTTGGACCAC.
Western blot
Chromatin and nuclei protein fractions from macroH2A1.1GFP, macroH2A1.2-GFP, and GFP transgenic HepG2 and Huh-7
cells were isolated (35). Cell pellets were suspended in buffer A
(10 mmol/L HEPES, 10 mmol/L KCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 340
mmol/L sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L DTT), incubated on ice,
and centrifuged at 1,300  g at 4 C for 5 minutes to separate
supernatant from nuclei. Nuclei fractions were washed once and
lysed for 30 minutes in buffer B (3 mmol/L EDTA, 0.2 mmol/L
EGTA, 1 mmol/L DTT) and centrifuged at 1,700  g at 4 C for 5
minutes to separate the supernatant (nuclei) from the pellet
(chromatin). Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction from
rodent liver parenchyma and hepatoma cells, and immunoblotting analyses were performed as described previously (3). The
histone fraction was enriched using acid extraction and 2,2,2trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Primary antibodies were
obtained from Activ Motif (macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2),
Cell Signaling Technology [phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/
Tyr182), p38 MAPK, phospho-MSK1 (Thr581), MSK1, phospho-ATF2 (Thr71), and ATF2], and Abcam (GFP, PCNA). Antibodies against histone H3 (Activ Motif), GAPDH (Cell Signaling
Technology), and b-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used
to normalize protein levels.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNAsequencing
For both chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIPSeq) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq), Genomix4life S.r.l. performed sample quality control by next-generation sequencing.
ChIP was performed with a modiﬁed protocol as described
previously (36). Chromatin complexes were lysed, extracted,
digested with micrococcal nuclease (MNase), immunoprecipitated (using 4 mg of anti-GFP antibody, ab290; Abcam), and
reverse crosslinked. DNA fragments (200 to 1,000 bp) were
then cleaned up and eluted using the components of the Pierce
Agarose ChIP Kit, ChIP-Grade Protein A/G Plus Agarose and

DNA Hypomethylation and macroH2A1 Synergism in HCC

Proteinase K (Pierce). Primer sequences for positive controls of
macroH2A1 isoform binding to chromatin in HepG2 cells were
LAMA5_-2.8K_F: AGAATGCCCCCACCCTAC, LAMA5_-2.8K_R:
TCCCAAGGTCAGGAGTTCAC; PTPRN_-199_F: TGTAAAGCACCTTGGAGACTG, PTPRN_-39_R: CAGAGAGCACAGCAGGAGAG. For RNA-Seq, total RNA was extracted from GFP-,
macroH2A1.1-GFP, or macroH2A1.2-GFP transgenic HepG2
cell lines with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Indexed libraries
were prepared from 2 mg/ea puriﬁed RNA with the TruSeq Total
Stranded RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Libraries were quantiﬁed using the
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and pooled so
that each index-tagged sample was present in equimolar
amounts; the ﬁnal concentration of the pooled samples was
2 nmol/L. Pooled samples were then subjected to cluster
generation and sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq 2500
System (Illumina) in a 2  100 paired-end format at a ﬁnal
concentration of 8 pmol/L.
Bioinformatics analyses
RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq raw data (.fastq ﬁles) underwent quality control analysis using the FastQC software package. Short
reads were discarded, trimmed, or adapter-cleaned where necessary. Transcripts were assembled by aligning around 30 million
reads per sample toward the hg19 reference genome by Bowtie2.
Uniquely mapped reads that fell within each feature of interest
were counted and RPKM normalized. Twenty million reads for
each ChIP-seq experiment were mapped against hg19 by Bowtie.
A peak calling strategy implemented in the Partek Genomics Suite,
which was set to tolerate broadly spreading and weaker patterns,
was used to predict the regions of the genome where the ChiPed
histone was bound. Differentially expressed and differentially
bound genes were subjected to in-silico functional enrichment
analysis by QIAGEN's Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Functions and
pathways were considered signiﬁcantly over-represented if P
values were <0.05. Genes of relevant pathways were marked with
colors to represent their expression directions.
Statistical analyses
The RNA-Seq study was designed with a sample size of 14 and
conferred a power (1-beta) of 0.8, when the signiﬁcance threshold (alpha) was set at 0.05. We tolerated less than 5% of false
positives and considered only genes with at least a 1.5-fold
difference (FDR-corrected P value <0.05). Differential expression between genes was determined by two-way ANOVA in the
Partek Genomics Suite, and any random batch effects were
minimized using the Batch Effect Removal tool of Partek.
One-tailed binomial tests were used to calculate P values, which
compared each sample with their respective reference (GFP) in
the ChIP-Seq experiment. A low P value meant there were
signiﬁcantly more reads in the sample than in the reference
sample. The scaled change in intensity of each signal was compared with the reference sample. The change was scaled by a ratio
of the number of reads for each sample on a per-chromosome
basis. A scaled change >1 indicated more enrichment in
the sample than in the reference. The whole procedure of
functional enrichment analysis was based on prior calculation
of the activation z-scores, which infer the activation states of
predicted transcriptional regulators, functions, and pathways.
To confer solidity to the analysis, we considered z-scores > 2

www.aacrjournals.org

(minimum activation threshold) and < 2 (minimum inhibition threshold).
Results were expressed as mean  SE. Comparisons between
means were made by appropriate Student t tests. Differences of
proportions were assessed by one-tailed c2 tests. Differences were
considered as signiﬁcant when P < 0.05.

Results
Increased levels of macroH2A1 isoforms in old livers and in
human HCC are associated with b-galactosidase expression
Murine hepatic expression of macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2
increases from newborn to adult age (26). We detected signiﬁcantly increased expression of macroH2A1 isoforms (P < 0.01 for
macroH2A1.1 and P < 0.001 for macroH2A1.2, respectively) in
the liver of old (30 months) compared with young (3 months)
mice (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, in healthy humans, the proportion of
nuclei that were immunopositive for macroH2A1 isoforms was
signiﬁcantly higher in the livers of old versus young individuals
(macroH2A1.1: 45.2%  2.4% in old vs. 36.5%  1.5% in young,
respectively, P < 0.05; macroH2A1.2: 56.2%  2.9% in old vs.
36.4%  2.4% in young, respectively, P < 0.05; Fig. 1B and C).
Hepatocyte nuclei from older subjects were larger than in younger
subjects (Fig. 1B and C), most likely reﬂecting liver cell polyploidy, which indicates terminal differentiation and senescence. Consistent with previous studies (3), hepatocyte immunopositivity
for macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2 was signiﬁcantly higher in
viral cirrhosis and HCC compared with healthy young controls
(Fig. 1B and C). A signiﬁcantly higher number of cells immunopositive for b-galactosidase (b-gal), a key marker of cellular
senescence, paralleled the severity of liver disease (control <
cirrhosis < HCC) in humans, as demonstrated by H&E and
Trichrome staining (Fig. 2A–D). Taken together, these ﬁndings
demonstrate that hepatic expression of macroH2A1 isoforms
increases with healthy aging and during liver cirrhosis and HCC,
and this is paralleled by the growing expression of the senescence
marker b-gal.
Global DNA hypomethylation in HCC but not in old livers
Global changes in DNA methylation may play a pleiotropic
role during aging and age-related pathologies, such as cancer. To
investigate this, we assessed global genomic DNA methylation in
the liver using LUMA. The median LUMA genome-wide methylation was similar, approximately 70%, in liver from old (30
months old) and young (3 months) mice (Fig. 3A). Moreover,
we did not detect differences in immunopositivity for cytosine-5
methylation in liver samples from old versus young humans (Fig.
3B and C). Global genomic DNA hypomethylation is observed
along the liver disease spectrum (20). Accordingly, nuclear immunopositivity for cytosine-5 methylation was decreased in liver
biopsies from HCC patients compared with cirrhotic and healthy
(young and old) controls (Fig. 3B and C). Furthermore, we
compared hepatic DNA methylation levels of patients with HCC
and cirrhosis with those of controls in four major datasets from
the Gene Expression Omnibus databank (GSE44970, GSE56588,
and GSE60753) and from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; Fig.
3D). The proportion of signiﬁcantly differentially methylated
genes in each dataset indicated signiﬁcantly higher DNA hypomethylation in HCC than in cirrhosis. Altogether, our experimental and in-silico analyses show that hepatic expression of
macroH2A1 isoforms correlates with DNA hypomethylation

We used whole-body KO mice for macroH2A1 (12) to investigate age-dependent hepatocyte senescence and DNA methylation. We stained the livers of 21.4- to 23.3-month-old
macroH2A1 KO mice and aged-matched wild-type littermates
for senescence-associated X-gal staining. There were no differences
between the two genotypes (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
Young, 3-month-old, mice of either genotype were negative for Xgal staining (data not shown). Furthermore, the levels of positivity
for cytosine-5 methylation in the liver of old macroH2A1 KO
versus wild-type mice were comparable (Supplementary Fig. S1C
and S1D). These data suggest that genetic ablation of macroH2A1
has no effect on chief markers of hepatocyte senescence and DNA
methylation during physiologic aging.
macroH2A1 isoforms synergize with 5-aza-dC–induced global
DNA hypomethylation and display protection against 5-azadC–dependent senescence-like phenotype in HCC cells
Promoter DNA hypermethylation and heterochromatinization
are events frequently leading to tumorigenesis (37). In ﬁbroblasts,
knockdown of macroH2A1 synergizes with 5-aza-dC–induced

DNA demethylation and decreases cell proliferation (25). To
investigate if macroH2A1 isoforms synergize with 5-aza-dC–
induced global DNA hypomethylation and display protection
against 5-aza-dC–dependent senescence, we generated lentiviralmediated stable HepG2 and Huh-7 cell lines transgenic for GFP,
macroH2A1.1-GFP, or macroH2A1.2-GFP (Fig. 4). Bands at a
molecular weight of approximately 70 KD, corresponding to the
sum of GFP and macroH2A1 molecular weights, were detected
upon nuclear/chromatin fractionation by immunoblotting, indicating a moderate increase in its expression levels (Fig. 4A and D).
H3 served as a marker for the chromatin fraction, PCNA as a
marker of both nuclear and chromatin fractions, and GAPDH as a
negative marker to exclude cytoplasmic contamination. Cells
transgenic for macroH2A1.1-GFP or macroH2A1.2-GFP were
viable and morphologically indistinguishable from GFP transgenic cells, and 5-aza-dC did not alter the endogenous expression
levels of macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2 in HepG2 and Huh-7
cells (Fig. 4B and E). As expected, LUMA assay revealed an
approximately 25% and 40% decrease in global DNA methylation in control GFP-expressing HepG2 and Huh-7 cells, respectively (Fig. 4C and F). Transgenic expression of either
macroH2A1.1-GFP or macroH2A1.2-GFP synergized with 5aza-dC and induced greater DNA hypomethylation: of approximately 40% to 50% in HepG2 cells, and of approximately 60% to
75% in Huh-7 cells, compared with respective untreated control

cells (Fig. 4C and F). HepG2 and Huh-7 cell lines treated with
12 mmol/L 5-aza-dC for 72 hours exhibited a characteristic ﬂattened morphology and positive staining for the senescence marker b-galactosidase (Fig. 5A and E), compared with untreated cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Imaging-assisted quantitative analyses
revealed that approximately 70% of GFP-expressing HepG2 cells,
and approximately 80% of GFP-expressing Huh-7 cells, were
positive for b-galactosidase staining (Fig. 5A, B, E, and F). In
contrast, only approximately 40% and 35% of macroH2A1.1-GFP
and macroH2A1.2-GFP HepG2 transgenic cells, and approximately 60% and 35% of macroH2A1.1-GFP and macroH2A1.2-GFP
Huh-7 transgenic cells, respectively, were positive (Fig. 5A, B, E, and
F), indicating an antisenescence effect of macroH2A1 isoforms. In
the Hepa1-6 mouse HCC cell line, 5-aza-dC treatment induced
a weaker b-gal staining compared with HepG2 and Huh-7
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Transient overexpression of
macroH2A1.1-GFP or macroH2A1.2-GFP induced a decrease in
the number of b-gal–positive Hepa1-6 cells, accompanied by an
antisenescence gene expression proﬁle (including decreased
mRNA expression of GLB1, the gene encoding for b-gal), when
compared with control cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3C).
Senescence is characterized by a withdrawal from cell cycle and
decrease in cell proliferation. In this respect, macroH2A1.1-GFP
and macroH2A1.2-GFP transgene-bearing HepG2 and Huh-7
cells displayed a signiﬁcant 2- to 3-fold increase in cell growth
compared with control GFP-expressing cells upon 5-aza-treatment, but not in untreated cells (Fig. 5C and G). Micrograph
analysis of wound closure in scratch assays showed faster cell
migration in both macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2 transgenic

HepG2 and Huh-7 cells upon drug treatment (Fig. 5D and H).
Notably, 5-aza-dC treatment did not induce the appearance of
SAHF in HCC cell lines (data not shown). In vivo, genetic ablation
of macroH2A1 did not inﬂuence hepatic senescence (Supplementary Fig. S1). In vitro, knocking down the whole macroH2A1
gene in HepG2 cells (knockdown, KD) using a stable siRNA
approach achieved a nearly total deletion of macroH2A1.1 and
macroH2A1.2 proteins (Supplementary Fig. S4A): KD cells proliferated slower and showed a slower wound closure in the scratch
assay, compared with control cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B and
S4C). Mirroring in vivo data, we observed no differences in b-gal
staining between control and KD cells following treatment with 5aza-dC (Supplementary Fig. S4D). Therefore, macroH2A1 isoforms facilitate the escape from the 5-aza-dC–induced prosenescent phenotype in HCC cells.
macroH2A1 isoforms induce escape from 5-aza-dC–induced
senescence through p38 MAPK/IL8 signaling in HCC cells
Tumor-suppressor proteins p53, p16, and p21 are involved in
cell-cycle control and are considered master regulators of cell
senescence. However, in our HCC cell models, neither 5-aza-dC
nor macroH2A1 isoform transgenes altered their endogenous
expression levels (data not shown). A central feature of senescence is the induction of the SASP, which implicates a complex
interplay of cytokines and growth factors that are released from
senescent cells (38). 5-aza-dC induces SASP in HepG2 cells (21).
We thus measured the expression of a panel of SASP components in the supernatants of HepG2 and of Huh-7 cells treated
with 5-aza-dC. In all cell lines, 5-aza-dC incubation increased

whereas it had no effect on IL6 (Fig. 6A and Supplementary
Fig. S5A). Surprisingly, in macroH2A.1- and macroH2A1.2
transgenic cells, IL8 and, to a minor extent, IL1b levels were
signiﬁcantly augmented when compared with control cells (Fig.
6A and Supplementary Fig. S5A). To gain a deeper insight into
the transcriptional proﬁles of 5-aza-dC–treated HCC cells, we
used RNA-Seq. Venn diagrams (Supplementary Fig. S6A)
revealed a low overlap between differentially expressed gene in
macroH2A1.1-GFP and macroH2A1.2-GFP transgenic cells versus GFP transgenic cells (Supplementary Table S1). Similarly,
the transcriptional proﬁles of macroH2A1 KO versus GFP cells
showed little overlap (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Heatmaps in
Supplementary Fig. S6C and S6D represent the fold changes of

the differentially expressed genes. These listed genes signiﬁcantly
enriched (–log(p-value) >1.3) a number of functions and diseases, including cancer, which macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2
transgenic cells over-represented (Supplementary Fig. S7A; Supplementary Table S2). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA)
highlighted genes belonging to the p38 MAPK pathway within
the pathway "cancer," which was signiﬁcantly over-represented
(P < 0.001) in macroH2A1.1-GFP and macroH2A1.2-GFP transgenic HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7B). IPA analysis suggested that p38 activation induced IL8 production (Supplementary Fig. S7B). To detect the activation status of p38 MAPK in
HepG2 and Huh-7 cells upon 5-aza-dC treatment, we conducted
an immunoblotting analysis of phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/
Tyr182) and downstream effectors phospho-MSK1 (Thr581)

and phospho-ATF2 (Thr71): conﬁrming the in silico analysis, an
increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and its downstream
effectors was detected in macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2 transgenic HepG2 and Huh-7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S8A and
S8C). We then used a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK activity,
SB202190, at a concentration (10 mmol/L) that is cytostatic in
both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S9A and S9B), and previously demonstrated to be effective in inhibiting p38 MAPK in
HCC cells (39). Coincubation of HepG2 or Huh-7 cells with
SB202190 and 5-aza-dC for 72 hours did not affect hyperphosphorylation of p38 MAPK in macroH2A1 isoform transgenic
cells, whereas MSK1 and ATF2 phosphorylation returned to
basal levels, as expected (Supplementary Fig. S8A–S8D).
We then tested the hypothesis that blockade of p38 kinase or

www.aacrjournals.org

IL8 could hamper IL8 hyperproduction. Coincubation of
HepG2 or Huh-7 cells with SB202190 and 5-aza-dC for 72
hours prevented IL8 hyperproduction in macroH2A1.1-GFP
and macroH2A1.2-GFP transgenic cells compared with control
cells (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S5B). In contrast, treatment with potent and selective IL8 receptor (CXCR2) antagonist
SB265610 (10 mmol/L; ref. 40) was not effective in blocking the
increase of IL8 levels in macroH2A1.1-GFP and macroH2A1.2GFP transgenic cells upon 5-aza-dC treatment (Fig. 6B and
Supplementary Fig. S5B). Thus, IL8 binding to its receptor is
not apparently involved in IL8 secretion. SB202190 and
SB265610 were effective in blocking the macroH2A1.1-GFP–
and macroH2A1.2-GFP–dependent escape from 5-aza-dC–

(Fig. 6D and Supplementary Fig. S5D). In conclusion, macroH2A1
isoforms might confer resistance to drug-induced senescence
through a p38 MAPK/IL8 mechanism in HCC cell lines.
Redistribution of macroH2A1 isoform genomic occupancy is
largely independent on 5-aza-dC–induced transcriptional
regulation
We sought to analyze if changes in chromatin occupancy by
macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2 might play a role in 5-aza-dC–
induced transcriptional changes. We used ChIP-Seq, using a ChIP
grade anti-GFP antibody, to precipitate GFP and macroH2A1-GFP
chimeric proteins (Supplementary Fig. S10A). LAMA5 and PTPRN
genes were used as positive controls to assess chromatin binding
by qRT-PCR, which showed tight macroH2A1 binding to chromatin in macroH2A1.1-GFP and macroH2A1.2-GFP transgenic
cells compared with GFP-expressing cells (Supplementary Fig.
S10B). Full ChIP-Seq raw data are reported in Supplementary
Table S3. 5-aza-dC treatment was associated with differentially

602 Cancer Res; 76(3) February 1, 2016

ChIPed genes that were signiﬁcantly more represented in
macroH2A1.1-GFP (449) than in macroH2A1.2-GFP (166)–
overexpressing cells, with only 60 genes in common (Fig. 7A).
AKT3 and STARD8, also known as DLC-3, are shown in Fig. 7B as
examples of HCC-related genes displaying differential binding
with macroH2A1.1-GFP and macroH2A1.2-GFP, respectively,
upon 5-aza-dC treatment. Binding sites were subsequently
grouped by gene section, i.e., 30 or 50 untranslated region (UTR),
coding sequence, intergenic, intron, noncoding, and promoter
(Supplementary Fig. S10C). The frequency of occupancy showed
that macroH2A1.2 binding was enriched in intergenic and promoter regions, and decreased in introns, 50 UTR, and noncoding
regions, whereas macroH2A1.1 binding was decreased in intergenic regions and increased in introns (Supplementary Fig. S10C).
Filtering only binding sites that exhibited P values <0.05, Mann–
Whitney P values <0.1, and differential scaled changes of at
least 0.5-fold between 5-aza-dC–treated and –untreated cells,
and further selecting genes that were differentially expressed
(>1.5-fold) at the mRNA level between 5-aza-dC–treated

and –untreated cells, we obtained only 28 and 9 genes for
macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, respectively, involved in nutrient metabolism and cancer pathways (Circos plot, Fig. 7C). Our
genomic analysis thus demonstrated that 5-aza-dC treatment
induces modest changes in macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2
genome occupancy that may not account for its transcriptional
effects in HCC cells.

Discussion
In this study, we describe a new epigenetic synergism between
the histone variant macroH2A1 and DNA methylation, controlling the escape of HCC cells from drug-induced senescence. HCC
frequently involves genome-wide DNA hypomethylation accompanied by focal promoter hypomethylation and heterochromatinization. Interestingly, global DNA hypomethylation is also a
characteristic of most aging tissues, with the exception of the liver
(41). Our data in healthy old versus young murine and human
liver specimens conﬁrm these ﬁndings. Focal DNA methylation
signatures have been used as biomarkers of HCC (20), and of
healthy liver aging progression (42). The liver is an ideal tissue to
study the epigenetic mechanisms that control cell fate toward
healthy aging or cancer. We focused on emerging epigenetic
players in tumorigenesis, the exon-spliced isoforms of histone
variant macroH2A1—macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2 (13)—

and their interplay with DNA methylation during aging and HCC.
Although macroH2A1.1 acts as a tumor suppressor in many
cancer types, the role of macroH2A1.2 is context-dependent
(10). MacroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2 are dramatically and
equally upregulated in HCC (3), reﬂecting the lack of linearity
in macroH2A1 pre-mRNA splicing processes identiﬁed in HCC
versus adjacent normal liver tissues (43). The whole macroH2A1
gene acts synergistically with 5-aza-dC–induced DNA demethylation to silence the tumor suppressor and senescence marker p16
in ﬁbroblasts (25). We found that an increased expression of
macroH2A1 isoforms is associated to senescence marker b-gal
staining in human HCC tissue. Protein levels of macroH2A1
isoforms were also signiﬁcantly increased without changes in
5-methyl cytosine positivity in the liver of old mice and humans.
To study the functional interplay between the macroH2A1 isoforms, HCC-associated DNA hypomethylation, and senescence/
HCC aggressiveness, we established HepG2 and Huh-7 HCC cell
lines expressing GFP-, macroH2A1.1-GFP-, and macroH2A1.2GFP transgenes. Consistent with previous reports (21–24), incubation of HepG2 and Huh-7 cells with DNA-demethylating agent
5-aza-dC induced a senescent-like phenotype, characterized by
b-gal staining, reduced proliferation, and migration. Overexpression of either macroH2A1.1 or macroH2A1.2 counteracted this
drug-induced senescent-like phenotype. In addition, macroH2A1
isoform activity induced a decrease in b-gal staining and an

increase in antisenescence gene expression in mouse HCC cells
(Hepa1-6), indicating a potential evolutionarly conserved mechanism. Conversely, KD of the macroH2A1 gene slowed cell
proliferation and migration compared with control HCC cells.
However, KO of macroH2A1 in old mice or KD in 5-aza-dC–
treated HepG2 cells had no effects on global DNA methylation
and senescence markers. MacroH2A1 function is thus dispensable
for age- and drug-induced senescence. The cellular response to
DNA hypomethylation is variable. In part, the affected genomic
region dictates the cellular response to loss of DNA methylation:
hypomethylation of gene regulatory regions, such as promoters,
can remove gene repression, whereas hypomethylation of repetitive elements can reduce heterochromatin formation and promote genomic instability. Our data show that transgenic expression of macroH2A1.1 or macroH2A1.2 in HepG2 and in Huh-7
cells paradoxically synergized with 5-aza-dC to induce a decrement in DNA genome-wide methylation. Further studies are

needed to determine which genomic regions are selectively
demethylated by macroH2A1 overexpression or by DNAdemethylating drugs in HCC; interestingly, in colorectal cancer
cells, 5-aza-dC targets genomic DNA, whereas promoter CpG
island methylation remains unchanged (44).
In HCC cells, 5-aza-dC–induced senescence was not accompanied by activation of the classic regulator of senescence p16,
p21, and p53. Instead, we report SASP activation, consistent
with previous studies (21). Among SASP cytokines/chemokines, IL8 expression displayed a 2-fold increase in protein
levels in cells transgenic for macroH2A1 isoforms upon 5-azadC treatment. macroH2A1 was recently shown as a critical
component of the feedback loop that maintains SASP in oncogene-induced senescence (45). Our RNA-Seq showed that cells
transgenic for macroH2A1 isoforms displayed higher levels of
mRNAs involved in oncogenesis than cells depleted of
macroH2A1. In detail, IPA indicated a strong enrichment of

DNA Hypomethylation and macroH2A1 Synergism in HCC

transcripts involved in p38 MAPK activation and subsequent
IL8 protein production in HCC cells transgenic for macroH2A1
isoforms. p38 MAPK signaling activation was conﬁrmed by
immunoblotting. p38 MAPK and IL8 are implicated in HCC
aggressiveness and metastatic potential (46, 47). Our ﬁndings
using highly selective inhibitors of p38 MAPK activity and IL8
receptor activation showed that blockage of either pathway is
sufﬁcient to dampen the antisenescence effect of macroH2A1
isoforms. Furthermore, IL8 production by macroH2A1 transgenic HCC cells was dependent on p38 MAPK signaling, a
mechanism previously identiﬁed for IL8 production in immune
cells (48). Campisi's laboratory demonstrated that p38 MAPK
activity is necessary and sufﬁcient to regulate SASP, independently of p53 and p21, as in our study, upon a variety of
senescence-inducing stresses (49).
Despite having transcriptional and genomic patterns partially
overlapping, macroH2A1 isoforms trigger a similar escape from 5aza-dC–induced tumor suppression. Our computational analysis
revealed a very limited number of genes with different mRNA
levels in 5-aza-dC–treated and –untreated cells that were differentially bound by either one or other of the isoforms. This might
suggest indirect oncogenic/SASP transcriptional programs independent of changes in macroH2A1 genomic occupancy. Variations in macroH2A1 transcriptional activities without changes in
genome occupancy have been reported in breast cancer cells (8).
In summary, our data indicate that macroH2A1 might be a
simple bystander in the liver of the healthy elderly, and it might
not be of use to counteract age-associated senescence in the
absence of DNA demethylation. Conversely, macroH2A1 could
be both a powerful tissue biomarker to stratify HCC patients (3)
and a new target to implement SASP- and chemotherapy-based
therapeutic opportunities (24, 38, 45).
