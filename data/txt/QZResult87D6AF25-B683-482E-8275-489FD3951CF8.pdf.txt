Influence of Conformal Radiotherapy Technique on Survival
After Chemoradiotherapy for Patients With Stage III Non-Small
Cell Lung Cancer in the National Cancer Data Base
David J. Sher, MD, MPH1; Matthew Koshy, MD2; Michael J. Liptay, MD3; and Mary Jo Fidler, MD4

BACKGROUND: Definitive chemoradiotherapy is a core treatment modality for patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Although radiotherapy (RT) technologies have advanced dramatically, to the authors’ knowledge relatively little is known
regarding the importance of irradiation technique on outcome, particularly given the competing risk of distant metastasis. The
National Cancer Data Base was used to determine predictors of overall survival (OS) in patients with AJCC stage III NSCLC who were
treated with chemoradiotherapy, focusing on the importance of conformal RT (CRT). METHODS: Patients with stage III NSCLC who
were treated with chemoradiotherapy between 2003 and 2005 in the National Cancer Data Base were included. RT technique was
defined as conventional, 3-dimensional–conformal, or intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), the latter 2 combined as CRT. Cox proportional
hazards regression was performed for univariable and multivariable analyses of OS. RESULTS: The median, 3-year, and 5-year survival
outcomes for the 13,292 patients were 12.9 months, 19%, and 11%, respectively. The 3-year and 5-year survival probabilities of patients
receiving CRT versus no CRT were 22% versus 19% and 14% versus 11%, respectively (P <.0001). On multivariable analysis, CRT was
found to be significantly associated with improved OS (hazards ratio, 0.89). This effect was confirmed on sensitivity analyses, including restricting the cohort to minimum 6-month survivors, young patients with stage IIIA disease, and propensity score-matching. Institutional academic status and patient volume were not found to be associated with OS. CONCLUSIONS: CRT was found to be
independently associated with a survival advantage. These results reflect the importance of optimal locoregional therapy in patients
with stage III NSCLC and provide motivation for further study of advanced RT technologies in patients with NSCLC. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Despite its wide prevalence, progress in the management of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been disappointing. The additions of induction and then concurrent chemotherapy have been shown to significantly improve survival, but since these seminal combined modality studies, subsequent prospective clinical trials have failed to meaningfully
improve outcomes.1-5 Indeed, the addition of surgery has increased locoregional control without a survival benefit, and
radiation dose escalation was paradoxically inferior to the dose established in 1980.6,7
Historically, thoracic radiotherapy (RT) planning has been complicated by difficult target delineation, unquantifiable tumor motion, and the absence of reproducible bony landmarks for internal anatomy, all issues that may lead to a geographic miss using conventional RT. These conventional methods also treated larger volumes, which increased the risks
of serious pulmonary and esophageal toxicity. With the advent of computed tomography (CT)-based planning and 3dimensional–conformal RT (3D-CRT), target delineation and normal tissue avoidance became more feasible. Although
in principle, such technical improvements should augment local control and potentially survival, to our knowledge there
are few data supporting this contention. Especially because there are high rates of distant metastasis in patients with
NSCLC, one may question the relative benefits of improved locoregional therapy and the importance of expertise in
delivering it. However, Chen et al used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database to show that
CT-based planning improved survival, although this study has been criticized for its large effect estimate and the challenge
of controlling for unknown confounders.8

local control and survival, we analyzed clinical and socioeconomic factors associated with improved survival in
patients treated with chemoradiotherapy for stage III
NSCLC in the NCDB, focusing on the relative impact of
CRT delivery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Database

The NCDB is a combined program of the CoC of the
American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer
Society.9 There are > 1500 CoC-accredited institutions,
and thus the NCDB includes > 70% of patients newly
diagnosed with cancer. Although case completeness has
not been assessed in patients with lung cancer in this database, Mallin et al recently showed that the NCDB captured 87% and 83% of chemotherapy claims among
patients with breast and colorectal cancer, respectively,
and 86% and 84%, respectively, of RT claims among
these same patients, suggesting quite acceptable capture of
relevant patient treatment information.10
Cohort Definition

Patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC between 2003
and 2005 and treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy
were eligible for inclusion in this cohort; patients with
small cell and carcinoid tumors were excluded. This time
window was used to ensure that all patients were assigned
a comorbidity score and RT modality. The NCDB
“analytic stage” was used, which defaulted to clinical stage
in cases without pathologic staging studies (eg, mediastinoscopy). Figure 1 details the inclusion=exclusion criteria
and the cohort selection.
Treatment Assignment

Patients were required to have initiated RT and chemotherapy within 3 weeks of each other to signify concurrent therapy. Patients without specified start dates were excluded.

Predictors were divided into clinical, time=geographic,
socioeconomic, and institutional. Several of the ordinal
variables were categorized by the NCDB (ie, educational
level, income in the patient zip code) as quartiles relative
to the US population, and the other continuous variables
were categorized as quartiles within the data set (eg, age,
distance from treatment center).
RT modality was reported for the initial RT course
as well as a boost course. The modality was defined as either intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), 3D-CRT, or a
beam energy (eg, 6- to 10-megavolt photons). Patients

with any code for IMRT were considered to have received
IMRT, and the remaining patients with any code for 3DCRT were considered to have received 3D-CRT. Patients
were defined as receiving CRT if the treatment was IMRT
or 3D-CRT. The remainder of the cohort was defined as
receiving conventional RT. The NCDB coded a RT treatment as conformal (or IMRT) only if the completion note
explicitly stated these terms.
Treatment volume was defined as the number of
cases per year of stage III NSCLC treated with chemoradiotherapy. Treatment volume was divided into quartiles
for a general volume-outcome analysis, and the upper decile was then used to represent the centers with the highest
treatment volume.
Statistical Analyses

Univariable analyses of the effect of each covariate on
overall survival (OS) were performed with the log-rank
test. All variables were then placed in a stepwise multivariable Cox regression model, and covariates were preserved
in the model if the P value was  .05. Because our selection criteria could not necessarily exclude patients who
may have received palliative instead of radical-intent chemoradiotherapy, we performed the same regression model
in patients who survived at least 6 months from the time
of diagnosis. We also performed a sensitivity analysis in
which the cohort was restricted to patients receiving
chemotherapy and RT within 2 weeks of each other (not
3 weeks) to further exclude potential palliative cases. Furthermore, to test whether CRT was confounded by a generally more favorable performance status, we performed
the Cox regression analysis including only patients with
stage IIIA disease, with a comorbidity score of 0 or 1, and
who were aged < 65 years. To further adjust for the effect
of unknown confounders, we developed a propensity
score model for the likelihood of receiving CRT; the propensity model included all covariates shown in Table 1.
One-to-one propensity matching was then performed
using the caliper match algorithm described by Coca-Perraillon,11 with the caliper width set to 0.05, and these
cohorts (ie, CRT vs non-CRT) were compared using a

using univariable Cox regression. We also used stepwise
logistic regression to determine predictors of CRT use in
this population.
All analyses were performed with SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Demographic, clinical, and nonclinical characteristics are
shown in Table 1. The cohort was predominantly white,
elderly, and male, with 53.8% of patients presenting with
stage IIIB disease. The vast majority of patients carried
private insurance or Medicare and, although the majority
of patients lived in a metropolitan county, nearly 25% of
the cohort traveled > 19.6 miles to the treatment center.

entire cohort.

was coded as conventional in the remaining 11,725
patients (88.2%). Multivariable predictors of CRT use
are shown in Table 2. There was a statistically significant
and clear increase in the use of CRT over time. Independent predictors of CRT use included favorable comorbidity
score, private=managed insurance coverage, and Atlantic=Northeast location. Physicians practicing at comprehensive community cancer programs implemented CRT
most frequently, and patients treated at high-volume centers were significantly more likely to receive CRT.
Survival Outcomes

The 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS probabilities were
28%, 19%, and 11%, respectively, with a median survival
of 12.9 months. The 3-year survival probabilities for
patients with stage IIIA and stage IIIB disease were 20%
and 18%, respectively. On univariable analysis, improved
survival was noted in patients of younger age, those of
female sex, those with stage IIIA disease, those with a
favorable comorbidity score, and those treated with CRT
(Table 2). The 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival probabilities of patients receiving CRT versus no CRT were
33% versus 28%, 22% versus 19%, and 14% versus 11%,
respectively (Fig. 2).

with the highest prevalence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, we created a specific cohort of
Asian females with a comorbidity score of 0 (94 patients);
these patients fared significantly better than the other
patients on multivariable analysis (HR, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.87 [P 5 .0023]), perhaps reflecting
the prognostic influence of the EGFR mutation.
There was no independent relationship found
between institutional characteristics (either academic nature or treatment volume) and survival.
Sensitivity Analyses

Cox regression analysis in patients who survived at least 6
months demonstrated that CRT maintained its significance, with the effect estimate comparable to the base
regression (HR, 0.90; P 5 .0009). When we restricted the
Cancer

July 1, 2014

cohort to patients whose chemotherapy and RT were
delivered within 2 weeks of each other, the HR for CRT
remained the same (HR, 0.88; P < .0001). In the model
that only included patients with stage IIIA disease who
were aged < 65 years with a comorbidity score of 0 or 1,
CRT was still associated with a HR of 0.90 (P 5 .0005).
The propensity model was then created, and the resultant matched cohort included 3134 patients, exactly
one-half of whom received CRT. There was an expected
balance of covariates in the 2 groups (Table 4). The median survivals for patients treated with and without CRT
were 15.0 months and 12.8 months, respectively, and the
2-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival probabilities were 33%
versus 27%, 22% versus 19%, and 14% versus 11%,
respectively (P 5 .002). The HR from a univariate Cox
regression was 0.89 (P 5 .002).

DISCUSSION
The results of the current study demonstrated that CRT
was significantly associated with improved survival for
patients with stage III NSCLC who were treated with chemoradiotherapy. This finding was maintained on multivariable analysis as well as several sensitivity analyses,
including propensity score matching. Our effect estimate
on the benefit of CRT (ie, a reduction in the rate of death
by 11% [HR, 0.89]) is essentially identical to the survival
improvement noted with the addition of concurrent
chemotherapy to RT alone and is comparable to the
advantage of concurrent versus sequential CRT (HR,
0.84).12,13 Indeed, in the study by Auperin et al, which
was a meta-analysis of the benefit of concomitant treatment, the entire benefit of concurrent therapy was
observed through improved local control, achieves its survival advantage.13
Successful RT for lung cancer is challenging both
because of target delineation and normal tissue toxicity;
an inability to see the tumor, as well as treat the lung to a
tolerable dose, clearly limits the likelihood of treatment
success. The development of CT simulation and CRT
allows for vastly superior radiation planning because it is
difficult to know the true extent of tumor on plain radiograph. Designing a tolerable treatment plan is also more
feasible since the lung dose-volume histogram can guide
beam arrangements. In fact, a recent subset analysis from
the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0617
study, which compared high-dose with standard-dose RT,
actually found that patients treated with IMRT experienced superior quality of life compared with patients
treated with 3D-CRT.14 Although there were too few
patients treated with IMRT in the current study to draw
conclusions regarding survival outcomes, this landmark
clinical trial did emphasize the importance of modern RT
planning.
The results of the current study are consistent with
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End ResultsMedicare study published by Chen et al, which demonstrated that CT simulation was associated with a notable
survival advantage (HR, 0.77) in comparison with conventional simulation.8 Both this study and the current
analysis strongly argue for the importance of properly
delivered thoracic RT, which may lead to a benefit in OS.
Although the prevalence of CRT is dramatically higher
today than in the current study, we believe that our results
are highly relevant for several reasons.15 First, given the
significant risk of distant metastasis in patients with lung
cancer, it is not immediately obvious that more conformal
locoregional treatment delivery would lead to a survival
2066

improvement, and these results confirm that it does. Second, the results of the current study are important to
properly place seminal RT trials into perspective; for
example, the definitive chemoradiotherapy arm in Intergroup 01396, which demonstrated inferior local control
and progression-free survival compared with trimodality
therapy, was delivered using CRT. With modern RT
techniques, the relative additional benefit of surgery may
be mitigated. Finally, in finding a significant improvement in outcome with CRT techniques over conventional
RT, the results of the current study provide further motivation to investigate the benefits of even more advanced
RT technologies, such as IMRT, which has now been
shown in both retrospective and prospective data
to improve the tolerability of high-dose RT.14 Data supporting a survival benefit to advanced RT technology are
particularly important given the well-known increased
costs of these progressively more conformal treatments.
The results of the current study also demonstrated
the negative prognostic importance of lower socioeconomic status, because lower income and Medicaid insurance were found to be independently associated with
inferior survival. These results are consistent with other
studies that have shown the survival detriment in patients
with low income16 and Medicaid coverage.17,18 Because
all of these patients were treated with chemoradiotherapy
at CoC-accredited institutions and the results were
adjusted for the RT technique used, these results point to
the influence of non–treatment-related parameters on survival, such as undocumented comorbidity, inadequate
social support at home, or fewer financial resources to
manage the complications of cancer and treatment.
We did observe an association between nonwhite
patients and improved survival. One potential explanation for this result is the higher prevalence of EGFR mutations in the Asian population; in the current study, female
Asian patients with the lowest comorbidity score fared
particularly well, perhaps demonstrating the prognostic
importance of EGFR mutation status in individuals with
stage III disease. However, it is difficult to draw any firmer
conclusions given the small number of Asian patients in
this cohort, and the NCDB does not provide information
regarding smoking status, making it impossible to further
investigate surrogates for EGFR status. The finding that
African American patients experienced improved survival
is provocative, because prior large database analyses have
suggested they fare worse.19 However, because a prior
study demonstrated that this population was much less
likely to undergo trimodality therapy in the NCDB, this
finding may simply represent selection bias.20

Finally, although we found that while patients
treated at high-volume institutions were significantly
more likely to undergo CRT, treatment at academic
and=or high-volume centers did not confer an independent survival advantage, suggesting that the ultimate success of definitive chemoradiotherapy was more a function
of treatment technique rather than institutional expertise.
Although one may hypothesize that treatment by more
experienced physicians may translate into an OS benefit
because of superior RT planning, chemotherapy administration, or supportive care, we did not note any such relationship in the current study cohort. It is important to
note that this result does not necessarily mean there are no
benefits to treatment at tertiary-care or more experienced
centers; it is conceivable that a locoregional control or toxicity benefit may be noted in these institutions, or that
these centers treated a more compromised, riskier
population.
Nevertheless, it appears that institutional characteristics play, at most, a modest role in influencing survival.
This conclusion stands in contrast to an NCDB study of
patients with advanced laryngeal cancer by Chen et al,
who found that patients treated with chemoradiotherapy
at high-volume academic centers were significantly more
likely to survive.21 Two explanations for this discrepancy
are the predominant role of locoregional failure in laryngeal cancer (vs lung cancer) and the higher complexity of
head and neck RT, both of which are factors that highlight the importance of institutional expertise.
The current study does have several limitations, the
majority of which are inherent functions of large database
analyses. Indeed, the validity of any registry-based analysis
relies on the completeness of its database, and although
data in other disease sites in the NCDB are very encouraging in that chemotherapy and RT administration are captured in the vast majority of cases, to the best of our
knowledge, we do not have those data in the lung cancer
population.10 Perhaps the most significant limitation of
the current analysis is the potential for misclassification
bias, because RT techniques were defined in the database
as IMRT, CRT, or simple beam energies, the latter of
which could have been delivered as CRT; the prevalence
of CRT does appear to be intuitively low for this time period.8 By definition, the RT completion note needed to
specify “conformal,” “3D,” or “IMRT” planning for the
NCDB to code that patient as receiving CRT; a patient
may have undergone CT simulation or even
CRT=IMRT, but if the treatment summary did not use
the term “conformal” or “IMRT,” it would be coded as a
conventional plan. It is therefore highly likely that we
Cancer

July 1, 2014

underestimated the prevalence of CRT (16.7% in 2005).
Another explanation for this intuitively low number is
that patients could have undergone CT simulation for isocenter placement or even contour delineation, but treatment plans were still calculated using 2D techniques and
thus were appropriately recorded in the database as conventional planning. Unfortunately, it was not possible to
estimate this planning approach in the data from the current study. More important, however, is the finding that
misclassification should bias the result toward the null,
and yet we still observed a robust survival advantage with
CRT, thereby supporting our conclusions.
Second, the current study did lack a significant
amount of patient-specific information regarding the
extent of stage III disease, including the number of
involved lymph node stations and a true accounting for
all comorbidities. However, we did make several efforts
to reduce the probability of confounding by unknown
treatment intent. Patients were excluded if the NCDB
recorded palliative care as a component of the first course
of therapy (Fig. 1), and we performed sensitivity analyses
excluding both patients who died within 6 months as
well as those patients whose RT and chemotherapy were
administered > 2 weeks apart. In both secondary analyses, the effect estimate for CRT was essentially
unchanged, mitigating the risk this result is due to confounding by treatment intent. Finally, the relationship
between CRT and survival may not reflect the benefit of
CRT per se but rather other aspects of care associated
with CRT, such as superior staging, chemotherapy
choice, medical oncology skill and coordination, and the
availability and quality of supportive care in a vulnerable
patient population.
The results of the current study demonstrate that
CRT improves OS in a cohort of patients treated with
chemoradiotherapy at CoC-accredited institutions. This
result was consistent and robust throughout adjustment
for known confounders, as well as several sensitivity analyses. Although the slow improvement in outcomes in
patients with stage III NSCLC has been predominantly
attributed to systemic chemotherapy, the data from the
current study argue that more advanced and conformal
locoregional therapy also plays an important role in the
successful treatment of this difficult disease.
