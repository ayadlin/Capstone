BACKGROUND. Rarely, patients who present with pancytopenia and are diagnosed
initially with aplastic anemia (AA) subsequently develop a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). There has been controversy regarding whether the initial diagnosis
of AA is correct or whether these patients have hypocellular MDS at the onset of
pancytopenia.

METHODS. The authors studied bone marrow (BM) specimens from patients who
were diagnosed initially with AA and subsequently with MDS from a cohort of
128 consecutive patients who had AA during the period from 1993 to 2004. Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were performed to
assess for monosomy 7 retrospectively in a subset of patients.

RESULTS. Twelve patients were identified (age range, 26–79 years). At the time
they were diagnosed with AA, there was no evidence of dysplasia, the median
BM cellularity was 5% (range, from <1% to 15%), and all patients had a normal
karyotype. Therapy for 11 patients included immunomodulating agents, which
were accompanied by growth factors in 4 patients and 1 patient underwent BM
transplantation. One patient received growth factors only. The median interval to
the diagnosis of MDS was 9 months (range, 2–43 months). The median BM cellularity was 30% (range, 5–90%), and dysplastic changes were observed in all
patients. Nine patients had an abnormal karyotype, and monosomy 7 was the
most common abnormality (n 5 5 patients). FISH detected monosomy 7 in 6
samples at the time MDS was diagnosed and in 2 samples at the time AA was
diagnosed.

CONCLUSIONS. The detection of monosomy 7 in specimens that were considered
AA and the short time interval to a subsequent diagnosis of MDS suggests that
these patients had hypoplastic MDS at the onset of pancytopenia. Therapy may
allow the detection of MDS by enhancing cell growth. Cancer 2007;110:1520–6.

he management and prognosis for patients with myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) or aplastic anemia (AA) differ substantially.1
However, distinguishing AA from hypoplastic MDS can be difficult,
because they share overlapping clinical and pathologic features.
Reports of patients who formerly had AA and later developed MDS
are considered by some investigators as examples of AA transforming into MDS. Although it is unclear why this occurs, some authors
have suggested abnormal growth stimulation by growth factors2–5 or
immunosuppression by antilymphocyte globulin as explanations.5,6
However, others believe that these patients who supposedly had
presented as AA had hypoplastic MDS at the onset of pancytopenia,
but it was not recognized initially because there were too few cells

for the morphologic appreciation of dysplasia or for
clonal detection by conventional cytogenetics. The
therapy simply had unmasked a preexisting abnormal dysplastic clone in patients who were misclassified initially with AA.
Previously, it was proposed that the inability of
bone marrow (BM) stroma to support hematopoiesis
was the underlying cause of AA.7 Thus, growth factors, including granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF),8–10 granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor,11–13 and erythropoietin,9,10 were incorporated into the therapeutic regimen for patients
with AA. It was demonstrated that growth factors
improved BM cellularity and peripheral blood counts
in some patients after long-term therapy.8–10 However, the effects of growth factor therapy tend to disappear shortly after treatment cessation, and growth
factor therapy no longer is considered the treatment
of choice for patients with AA.1 Currently, it is
believed that AA is mostly an immune-mediated disease because of abnormal activation of cytotoxic Tcells; therefore, immunosuppression with agents
such as cyclosporine, antithymocyte globulin (ATG),
and steroids is used as principal therapy with or
without G-CSF.14
Recently, we studied a patient with MDS who
had a history of AA. This led us to review our files
for similar patients to gain a better understanding of
this phenomenon. In total, we identified 12 similar
patients from a group of 128 who were diagnosed
with AA over 10 years. The clinicopathologic and
conventional cytogenetic findings of these patients
were reviewed, and fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) to detect monosomy 7 was performed retrospectively in a subset of patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The files of the Department of Hematopathology at
The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1993 through 2004 were searched for
patients who were diagnosed initially with AA and,
later in their clinical course, with MDS. Both clinical
and pathologic criteria were required for the diagnosis of AA. The following clinical criteria for AA were
adopted from the International Agranulocytosis and
Aplastic Anemia Study15: 1) hemoglobin 100 g/L, 2)
platelet count 50 3 109/L, and 3) white blood cell
count 1.5 3 109/L. Pathologic criteria for AA
included the following: 1) decreased cellularity of the
BM biopsy specimen, 2) the absence of morphologic
evidence of dysplasia in any cell lineage, and 3)
diploid karyotype. At least 2 of 3 clinical criteria and
all pathologic criteria were required for establishing

the diagnosis of AA. Hemolytic anemia and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria were excluded in all
patients by direct antiglobulin test and flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood
cells using antibodies specific for CD55 and CD59.
The diagnosis of MDS was based on the following criteria: unexplained cytopenia associated with 1)
dysplastic changes in >10% of cells of at least 1 lineage and evidence of a clonal abnormality by conventional cytogenetics and 2) persistent dysplastic
features in >50% of erythroid cells with ringed sideroblasts. The presence of either criterion in the
appropriate clinical setting was considered sufficient
for establishing the diagnosis of MDS. The morphologic criteria for dysplasia that we used were
described previously.16 All patients with MDS had
their disease classified according to the criteria of the
World Health Organization classification17 and the
International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS).18
Conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed
on metaphase cells that were prepared from BM
aspirate specimens as described previously.19 FISH to
detect monosomy 7 was performed using the LSI
ENL dual-color probe (Vysis Inc., Downers Grove,
Ill). This analysis was performed on formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissues sections as described previously.20 Two hundred cells for each patient specimen were scored independently by 2 investigators,
and the percentage of cells with monosomy 7
(detected as 1 red signal and 1 green signal) and normal cells (2 red signals and 2 green signals) was
recorded (Fig. 1). A cutoff level of 8% was established
using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues sec-

tions of staging BM biopsy specimens from patients
who had no history of hematologic malignancy or
evidence of metastatic tumor involving BM.
Various hematologic parameters at the time of
diagnosis of AA and at the time of diagnosis of MDS
were compared statistically using a 2-tailed Student t
test. Differences were considered significant at a confidence level of 95%.

RESULTS
Clinical Findings
In total, 128 consecutive patients with AA were seen
at our institution between 1993 and 2004. Twelve
patients (9.4%) subsequently developed MDS and
were included in this study. There were 9 women
and 3 men, and the median patient age was 53 years
(range, 26–79 years). Nine patients were diagnosed
with AA at outside institutions, treated with various
agents, and referred to our institution for possible
BM transplantation. Only 3 patients (Patients 2, 7,
and 9) were diagnosed initially with AA at our hospital. Therapeutic agents that were used for treating AA
are listed in Table 1. These included ATG, cyclosporine, and prednisone in 4 patients; ATG, cyclosporine,
and growth factors in 3 patients; ATG, growth factors,
and prednisone in 1 patient; only growth factors in 1
patient; ATG and prednisone in 1 patient; ATG and
cyclosporine in 1 patient; and ATG and prednisone
followed by allogeneic BM transplantation in 1
patient. In total, 5 patients received growth factor
therapy, which included G-CSF (n 5 5 patients), erythropoietin (n 5 3 patients), stem cell factor (n 5 2

patients), interleukin-11 (n 5 2 patients), and GMCSF (n 5 1 patient) either alone or in combination.
The median interval between the diagnosis of AA
and the diagnosis of MDS was 9 months (range, 2–
43 months), with a median of 16 months (range, 2–
43 months) for patients who received growth factors
and 8 months (range, 2–35 months) for patients who
did not receive growth factors (P 5 .38). In 3 patients,
the interval was <6 months. Five patients were classified as intermediate 1 (INT-1) risk group according
to IPSS, and 7 patients were classified as INT-2. The
median follow-up was 42 months (range, 11–130
months), and the most recent follow-up took place
in December 2006. Four patients had died (all were
classified as INT-2 risk group), and 8 patients were
still alive.

Hematologic Findings
The peripheral blood data at the time of AA diagnosis and subsequent MDS diagnosis are presented in
Table 2. There was no significant statistical difference
in the median hemoglobin level, absolute reticulocyte count, mean corpuscular volume, red cell distribution width, platelet count, or white blood cell
count at the times patients were diagnosed with AA
and MDS. There was no significant difference in hematologic parameters between patients who did and
did not receive growth factors as a part of therapy.
BM Findings
The median BM cellularity at time of AA diagnosis
was 5% (range, from <1% to 15%). Dysplastic
changes were not observed morphologically, and

cytogenetic abnormalities were not detected. The
median BM cellularity at time of MDS diagnosis was
30% (range, 5%–90%). Compared with BM cellularity
at the time of AA diagnosis, BM cellularity at the
time of MDS diagnosis was increased in 10 of 12
patients and was unchanged in 2 patients (P 5 .001).
Morphologic evaluation of BM aspirate smears
revealed erythroid dysplasia in all patients, and
ringed sideroblasts were present in 6 patients. Myeloid elements were dysplastic in 10 patients and
megakaryocytic dysplasia in 4 patients. The morphologic findings were similar in patients who did and
did not receive growth factors. The MDS was classified as follows: refractory cytopenia with multilineage
dysplasia (n 5 6 patients), refractory anemia (n 5 3
patients), refractory cytopenia with excess blasts-type
1 (n 5 2 patients), and refractory anemia with ringed
sideroblasts (n 5 1 patient). Two patients (Patients 7
and 8) eventually developed acute myeloid leukemia
(AML).

Cytogenetic Findings
Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 9
patients at the time of MDS diagnosis and are summarized in Table 3. Monosomy 7 was the most common finding (5 patients). Two patients had complex
karyotypes, 1 patient had trisomy 8, and 1 patient
had trisomy 15. In 3 patients, no cytogenetic
abnormalities were detected. Both low-grade MDS
(refractory anemia) and high-grade MDS (refractory
anemia with excess blasts) were identified in the
group of patients who had abnormal cytogenetic
findings.

Below the established cut-off level (8%) and, thus, interpreted as ‘‘no evidence of monosomy 7.’’

FISH Findings
FISH to assess for monosomy 7 was performed retrospectively in 10 BM specimens, including 3 specimens at the time of AA diagnosis and 7 specimens at
the time of MDS diagnosis (Table 3). In total, monosomy 7 was identified in 8 samples, including 2 samples at the time of AA diagnosis and 6 samples at the
time of MDS diagnosis. For the 6 samples that were
obtained at the time of MDS diagnosis and were
positive for monosomy 7 by FISH, conventional cytogenetics demonstrated an abnormal karyotype in all
6 samples, but monosomy 7 was detected in only 3
samples.

DISCUSSION
AA and MDS are considered distinct entities that are
managed differently, yet distinguishing between
these diseases can be problematic because of overlapping clinical and morphologic features.1 AA is
largely an immune-mediated process in which normal hematopoietic elements are destroyed by activated cytotoxic T cells.14 In contrast, MDS is a clonal
disorder of hematopoietic cells and is characterized
by ineffective hematopoiesis. Hypocellular MDS is a
poorly understood subgroup that comprises approxi-

mately 7% to 15% of all cases of MDS.21 BM cellularity usually is <30%, and monosomy 7 is the most
common cytogenetic aberration detected.22,23 Hypocellular MDS can be normal cytogenetically or even
may respond to immunosuppressive therapy as does
AA.24 Reports of MDS, which often is associated with
monosomy 7, in patients who formerly had AA further complicate the issue. In the current study, we
identified 12 patients (9.3%) who were diagnosed
first with AA and later with MDS from a cohort of
128 consecutive patients with AA who were seen in
our institution over 10 years. By focusing on this
group of patients, we explored the correlation
between AA and hypoplastic MDS and the possible
roles of therapy in their pathogenesis.
There are different views regarding whether MDS
in this patient subset represents clonal evolution or
initially misdiagnosed AA.25,26 Evidence that is considered supportive of the view that MDS is a manifestation of clonal evolution is that cytogenetic
aberrations are absent at the time of AA diagnosis
and then emerge gradually over the course of disease. Furthermore, these patients often are indistinguishable clinically from other patients who have AA
at the time of initial diagnosis. However, cytogenetic
aberrations can be detected as early as 4 to 7 months
after an AA diagnosis,27,28 and the majority occur
within 2 years. Also, rare studies have used more
sensitive tools, such as FISH, to determine whether a
specific abnormality that was detected subsequently,
at the time of overt MDS, was also present at the
time of the initial AA diagnosis.
The link between clonal evolution and prolonged
treatment with growth factors was provided first by
Japanese investigators who argued that MDS arose
from overgrowth of intrinsically abnormal or susceptible hematopoietic precursors driven by growth factors.2–4 This view appears to be supported by a
recent study by Sloand et al., who demonstrated in
vitro the increased expression of G-CSF receptors by
CD34-positive cells with monosomy 7.29 Those investigators also documented an increased Class IV GCSF receptor isoform, which lacked the membranedistal region of the receptor responsible for differentiation.29 From these data, it seems reasonable to
hypothesize that monosomy 7 cells, which are present at low levels in the early stages of hypocellular
MDS (when it mimics AA clinically and morphologically), are enriched selectively in vivo after G-CSF
treatment and become detectable at the cytogenetic
level. However, only 5 of 12 patients in the current
study received G-CSF treatment, and the median
time to diagnosis of MDS was longer, although the
difference was not significant (16 months vs 8

months; P 5 .38), in those 5 patients compared with
the other 7 patients who did not receive G-CSF treatment. Furthermore, a recent survey of 840 patients
with AA performed by the European Group for Blood
and Marrow Transplantation did not detect a significant difference in the 10-year incidence of MDS
(5.8% vs 3.2%; P 5 .17) or AML (6.4% vs 3.2%;
P 5 .14) between patients who did or did not receive
G-CSF, suggesting that G-CSF alone is insufficient or
does not account for the all diagnoses of MDS.30
An alternative view is that immunosuppressive
therapy allows an abnormal clone to escape immunosurveillance and expand to a detectable level. Evidence supporting this view was reported in a large
study by Socie et al.31 in which 34 of 860 patients
who received immunosuppressive treatment developed MDS or leukemia compared with only 2 of 748
patients who underwent BM transplantation. Socie
et al. also argued,32 however, that a qualitatively
abnormal clone most likely is present at the time of
AA diagnosis and that MDS evolves as additional hits
accumulate. Similarly, Barrett et al.33 proposed a ‘‘3event’’ model to describe the so-called progression
from AA, through low-grade MDS, to high-grade
MDS or AML. To our knowledge to date, there have
been no large series of chronological studies to sustain this hypothesis. Kearns et al. reported monosomy 7 or trisomy 8 by FISH in 10 of 38 patients who
had AA with a normal karyotype, confirming that the
seemingly normal cytogenetic findings in patients
with AA are not absolute; however, the timing of
FISH analysis was not specified in their report.34
Our current results suggest that most if not all of
these patients had hypoplastic MDS from the onset
of pancytopenia rather than AA. The most compelling evidence is the relatively short interval from the
diagnosis of AA to the diagnosis of MDS (median
interval, 9 months). To test our hypothesis, we retrospectively performed FISH for monosomy 7. We
chose this probe because monosomy 7 was the most
common cytogenetic abnormality detected at the
time of MDS diagnosis in this study group. Unlike
previous studies, we were able to compare the initial
AA samples directly with the corresponding, subsequent MDS samples in 3 patients and demonstrated
monosomy 7 in 2 of the initial samples that were
assessed. These results support the view that a low
level of abnormal clone was present at time of clinical diagnosis of AA, and that monosomy 7 is common in this setting.
Some studies of AA evolving to MDS have
included patients who had monosomy 7 at presentation.35,36 In our opinion, it is most likely incorrect to
diagnose AA in the presence of a cytogenetically pro-

MDS Mimicking AA/Konoplev et al.

ven clone that typically is associated with MDS,
because the absence of dysplasia does not exclude
the possibility of hypoplastic MDS. These patients
are more prone to develop overt MDS5 or are refractory to therapy designed for AA, and they require
prolonged G-CSF treatment,25,26 suggesting that, biologically, their disease is more akin to hypoplastic
MDS than AA and is best considered MDS.
In summary, the current results indicate that
patients with hypocellular MDS or AA can overlap
clinically and that some patients with MDS can present initially in hypoplastic phase that mimics AA.
Monosomy 7 is common in these patients, with an
even greater frequency than is appreciated by conventional cytogenetic studies. Immunomodulating
therapy for AA, with or without growth factors, may
play a role in unmasking MDS by increasing hematopoietic cell numbers, allowing the morphologic
detection of dysplastic changes. Therapy also may
increase cell numbers or enhance cell culture growth,
allowing the detection of cytogenetic abnormalities.
However, the current data do not provide clues
regarding the pathogenesis of the initial pancytopenic phase in these patients. AA remains a diagnosis
of exclusion, and it is important to monitor patients
with AA for subsequent evidence of dysplasia and/or
cytogenetic abnormalities.
