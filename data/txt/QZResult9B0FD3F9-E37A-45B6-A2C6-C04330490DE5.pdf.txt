BACKGROUND. Inflammation has been implicated in prostate carcinogenesis;
therefore, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has the
potential of decreasing the risk of prostate cancer. However, to the authors’ knowledge the precise correlation between oral NSAID use, serum prostate-specific

antigen (PSA), and prostate cancer risk is unknown. To further characterize this
association, the authors evaluated serum PSA levels with regard to NSAID and
acetaminophen consumption in a large cross-sectional study of men in the US.

METHODS. PSA levels were determined in 1319 men aged >40 years in the 20012002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Linear
regressions were performed on log-transformed PSA levels, accounting for the
complex survey design, to evaluate the relations between PSA and the use of
NSAIDs and acetaminophen after adjusting for the effects of age, race, educational level, smoking status, body mass index, coexisting inflammatory conditions, and heart disease.

RESULTS. NSAID and acetaminophen consumption displayed a negative association with PSA levels, namely, individuals who reported using NSAIDs (19.8%) or
acetaminophen (1.3%) regularly had lower PSA levels than individuals who did
not take these drugs, although the impact of acetaminophen was not statistically
significant. PSA levels among NSAID users were 0.9 times the levels among nondrug takers (P 5 .038), whereas PSA levels among acetaminophen users were 0.76
times the levels in nondrug takers (P 5 .14). Individuals who stated they took
both NSAIDs and acetaminophen (0.99%) on a regular basis had higher PSA
levels (1.8 times greater), although not statistically significantly so (P 5 .24), than
individuals who stated they did not take either of these drugs regularly.

CONCLUSIONS. The findings of the current study suggest that regular NSAID consumption may reduce serum PSA levels. Whether this is indicative of a protective
effect on prostate cancer risk or masks possible prostate injury resulting in
reduced detection of prostate cancer is unclear. Given the widespread consumption of NSAIDs and the regular use of PSA for the assessment of prostate cancer
risk, the potential implications of the current study’s findings may be substantial
and warrant further investigation. Cancer 2008;113:2053–7.  2008 American

this the second leading causes of cancer-related mortality for American men.1 Although the nature of the
risk factors contributing to the development of prostate cancer remains largely unknown,2-11 inflammation (via infection, hormonal changes, physical
trauma, urine reflux, and dietary habits) has been
postulated as a factor in prostate carcinogenesis.12-15
Consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen may impact
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and prostate
cancer risk via their effects on inflammation. Because
serum PSA levels are indicative of prostatic injury or
inflammation and are also used to assess a man’s
risk for prostate cancer, we evaluated the association
between the use of NSAIDs and acetaminophen and
PSA values in the 2001-2002 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
To our knowledge, the 2001-2002 NHANES is the first
of such surveys to determine PSA levels in men aged
>40 years.16,17 Levels of total and free PSA were
measured in 1320 eligible men after excluding men
who reported having any of the following conditions:
current infection or inflammation of the prostate
gland, rectal examination within the past week, prostate biopsy within the past month, cystoscopy within
the past month, history of prostate cancer, or were
missing data concerning any of these eligibility criteria.18 For the current analysis, we used total PSA
levels.
Explanatory Variables
Medication history was characterized as current, regular (‘‘nearly every day’’) consumption of NSAIDS
(including aspirin) or acetaminophen; both; or no
current intake. Unfortunately, dosing information, indication for use, and chronicity were not available
through the NHANES database. One participant was
excluded from the analysis because of missing data
regarding the consumption of NSAIDs or acetaminophen, resulting in a final dataset of 1319 men. Other
covariates considered to be potential risk factors for
elevated PSA levels include age (continuous or categorical; <60 years, 60-69 years, 70-79 years, and 80
years), race (white, black, and other), education
(<high school, high school, and >high school), body
mass index (BMI) (<25, 25-29, and 30), smoking
status (dichotomous: ever vs never), history of any
inflammatory disease (dichotomous: yes vs no;
includes asthma, hay fever, arthritis, emphysema, and
chronic bronchitis), and history of any heart disease

to decrease serum PSA values, were not available.19

Statistical Analysis
Linear regression was performed on log-transformed
PSA levels (untransformed PSA levels displayed a
left-skewed distribution) to evaluate the correlations
between PSA and the use of NSAIDs or acetaminophen. Age, race, educational level, smoking status,
BMI, coexisting inflammatory conditions, and heart
disease were chosen a priori as covariates in our
regression model. All statistical analyses were performed with SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS

and SURVEYREG procedures, which accounted for
the complex survey design by incorporating appropriate sample weights (WTSHM2YR) and stratum
and primary sampling unit variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively).

RESULTS
The study population was predominantly white
(79.4%) and aged <60 years (71.9%), with greater
than a high school education (58.7%) (Table 1). The
majority of PSA concentrations were <4.0 ng/mL
(mean of 1.6 ng/mL; median, 0.9 ng/mL [95th percentile, 4.5 ng/mL]). Current, regular users of NSAIDs
(19.8% of the sample population) had lower serum
PSA concentrations than those who did not take any
of the medications of interest (ie, NSAID, etc). Table 2
shows the results of the multiple linear regression
analysis of log-transformed PSA concentrations. PSA
levels in the NSAID group were 0.9 (ie, e20.10) times
the levels of nondrug takers (P 5 .038) (ie, average
PSA levels were 10% lower in the NSAID group).
Acetaminophen users (1.3% of the sample population) also had reduced serum PSA concentrations
that were 0.76 times (ie, e20.28) the levels of nondrug
takers, but not to a statistically significant degree (P
5 .14). In other words, PSA levels were 24% lower
among acetaminophen users compared with nondrug takers. Conversely, individuals who consumed
both NSAIDs and acetaminophen regularly (1.0% of
the sample population) appeared to have higher PSA
values (1.8 times or 80% greater [ie, e0.60]) than individuals who took neither of these drugs (P 5 .24).

DISCUSSION
Chronic inflammation has been linked to a multitude
of malignancies, including gastric, hepatic, biliary,

colorectal, and bladder cancers.20,21 Although to our
knowledge the causal nexus is not as well established
in prostate cancer, inflammation is also believed
to play a role in prostate carcinogenesis through
multiple mechanisms such as infection, hormonal
changes, physical trauma, urine reflux, and dietary
habits.12-15 Cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, via its inducible type-2 pathway and the subsequent conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, is a
potent mediator of inflammation and is known to be
inhibited by NSAIDs and aspirin.22 COX-2 activity
has been shown to influence carcinogenesis by favoring cell proliferation, inhibiting programmed cell
death, promoting neovascularization, and altering
immune surveillance.23-26
Acetaminophen, not traditionally considered an
NSAID, has also been recognized to possess some
anti–inflammatory properties, although its exact
mechanism remains unclear. Acetaminophen had
been believed to act via inhibition of the COX-3
pathway,27 but later evidence refuted this theory.28
Recently, acetaminophen has been suggested to
selectively inhibit the COX-2 pathway in ex vivo and
in vitro studies involving humans.29
Several systematic reviews have examined the
relation between NSAID/aspirin consumption and
the risk of developing prostate cancer. In their metaanalysis of 12 reports, Mahmud et al30 found that aspirin use provided a 10% risk reduction for prostate
cancer overall (summary odds ratio [OR] of 0.90; 95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 0.82-0.99) and a 30%
risk reduction for advanced disease (OR of 0.70; 95%
CI, 0.52-0.94). Harris et al31 reported that daily
NSAID use (which included aspirin) was associated
with a 39% risk reduction for prostate cancer (relative risk [RR] of 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.85). Jacobs
et al32 demonstrated in their cohort study that daily
long-term aspirin use was associated with an

approximately 20% lower incidence of prostate cancer (OR of 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94).
The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging,
which also examined acetaminophen consumption
in addition to NSAID/aspirin use, attempted to
determine their effects on serum PSA and the risk of
developing prostate cancer. This prospective study
concluded that men aged <70 years who used
NSAIDs had a lower risk of developing prostate cancer, although this result was not statistically significant (RR of 0.54; 95% CI, 0.27-1.03) (men aged >70
years did not experience a risk reduction).33 In addition, they detected no difference in serum PSA values
between NSAID users and nonusers (1.01 vs 0.98 ng/
mL, respectively; P 5 .56), and a nonstatistically significant decrease in PSA among users of acetaminophen and nonusers (1.01 vs 0.93 ng/mL, respectively;
P 5 .09). Platz et al33 were reassured by the lack of
clear correlation between NSAIDs and serum PSA, as
reductions in PSA due to decreased inflammation
may lower the number of men referred for prostate
biopsy, thereby decreasing the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer (incidence) without truly
altering the natural history of the disease.
We are not aware of other publications directly
reporting on the correlation between NSAID and
acetaminophen use and serum PSA levels. However,
several original observational studies and reviews of
the literature have suggested that NSAIDs may have
a role in the chemoprevention of prostate cancer.21,34,35 The results reported herein appear to
stand in contrast to those found in the Baltimore
Longitudinal Study of Aging. Although both studies
document a nonstatistically significant decrease in
serum PSA in men taking acetaminophen, to our
knowledge only the results of the current study
revealed a significant negative association between
NSAID consumption and serum PSA concentration.
The difference between these 2 studies is unclear.
The limitations of the current study include the
use of cross-sectional data that does not provide information regarding temporality of association. In
addition, the NHANES database does not have
detailed descriptions of medication dosing and frequency, and acetaminophen users comprised a small
percentage of the overall drug takers, thereby limiting
the conclusions that can be drawn from its use. Consumption of medications known to decrease serum
PSA, such as finasteride and dutasteride, were not
recorded in by the NHANES instrument. Although
the NHANES database lacks information regarding
prostate biopsies (presence/absence of inflammation,
adenoma, or adenocarcinoma) or the number of
men eventually diagnosed with prostate cancer,

NHANES does capture a nationally representative
cross-section of American men and collects information on many potentially important covariates, such
as those accounted for in Table 1 of our study. The
unexpected finding that concomitant use of both
NSAIDs and acetaminophen was associated with
increased PSA levels, although not significantly so,
may be because of the low number of subjects in
those categories (<1% of the total study population)
with a corresponding lack of statistical accuracy, and
likely does not indicate a biologic effect.

Conclusions
The interplay between NSAID consumption and serum PSA is complex and may involve a variety of different pathways and variables. Nevertheless, the
results of the current study are consistent with previous reports that NSAID use is a protective factor for
the development of prostate cancer. Conversely,
NSAIDs may reduce serum PSA levels without truly
affecting the natural history of prostate carcinogenesis, and may result in the underdiagnosis of this condition. The widespread use of PSA screening and the
high rate of consumption of NSAIDs in the general
population suggest further study is warranted to clarify the potential impact of this class of drugs on
prostate cancer development and diagnosis using
large epidemiologic studies with a prospective design
and collecting more detailed information regarding
NSAID use.
