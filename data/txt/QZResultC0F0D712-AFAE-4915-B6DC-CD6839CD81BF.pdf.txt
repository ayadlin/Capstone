ABSTRACT
The efficacy of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeted to solid tumors
depends on biological processes that are hard to monitor in vivo. 89Zr-immunoPET of
the ADC antibodies could help understand the performance of ADCs in the clinic by
confirming the necessary penetration, binding, and internalization. This work studied
monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) ADCs against two targets in metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer, TENB2 and STEAP1, in four patient-derived tumor models
(LuCaP35V, LuCaP70, LuCaP77, LuCaP96.1). Three aspects of ADC biology were
measured and compared: efficacy was measured in tumor growth inhibition studies;
target expression was measured by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry;
and tumor antibody uptake was measured with 111In-mAbs and gamma counting or
with 89Zr-immunoPET. Within each model, the mAb with the highest tumor uptake
showed the greatest potency as an ADC. Sensitivity between models varied, with
the LuCaP77 model showing weak efficacy despite high target expression and high
antibody uptake. Ex vivo analysis confirmed the in vivo results, showing a correlation
between expression, uptake and ADC efficacy. We conclude that 89Zr-immunoPET
data can demonstrate which ADC candidates achieve the penetration, binding, and
internalization necessary for efficacy in tumors sensitive to the toxic payload.

represent a selective entry portal into cancer cells [1].
However they are not necessarily molecular drivers
of cancer, and consequently there may be no selection
pressure resisting the loss of target expression in a new
metastatic or post-treatment environment. Such a loss
of expression could impair the ADC efficacy and this
potential adds to the importance of comprehensively
assessing and re-assessing the tumor target status.
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
is widely used for characterizing tumors, offering
excellent sensitivity and relatively good resolution [5-10].
ImmunoPET is used for tracking and quantification of
mAbs with PET in vivo. The availability of zirconium-89
(89Zr), and the adoption of standardized labeling protocols
are enabling clinical mAb imaging with immunoPET
to become more widespread, offering the potential for

INTRODUCTION
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a promising
new class of anti-cancer therapeutics that aim to
selectively deliver potent toxins to tumor cells by using
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as targeting moieties. This
should provide an improved therapeutic window in patient
tissues expressing the cognate antigen. Multiple ADCs are
in development for a variety of solid and hematological
cancer indications [1]. The approach has already shown
significant promise: recently-approved ADC molecules
include brentuximab vedotin (anti-CD30-MMAE) for
Hodgkins lymphoma and trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1)
for metastatic breast cancer [2-4].
ADC target antigens are typically chosen because
they exhibit tumor-specific expression and, if internalized,

RESULTS

whole-body non-invasive quantification of mAb uptake
in normal and tumor tissues [5-10]. Because of the
mechanistic importance of mAb delivery and tumor uptake
to ADC therapies, immunoPET may be of particular value
because the PET isotope is delivered to the cell by the same
mAb and internalization mechanisms as the toxin. Thus an
imaging signal in the tumor reveals processes necessary (but
not sufficient) for drug delivery – a combination of tissue
exposure, antigen binding, and antibody internalization [11].
For prostate cancer, TENB2 and STEAP1 have
been recently identified as targets of interest for ADC
development [12-14]. TENB2, a trans-membrane protein
containing an epidermal growth factor-like motif and two
follistatin-like domains, is found to be over-expressed in
clinical prostate carcinoma with particular prominence
in high-grade tumors [12]. STEAP1, six-transmembrane
epithelial antigen of the prostate-1, is an antigen that is
over expressed in the majority of human epithelial prostate
cancers [13]. Treatment for advanced prostate cancer is
particularly challenging due to the large number and
potential heterogeneity of metastatic growths in soft tissue
and especially in bone [15].
Molecular imaging of antibody delivery might
predict treatment effects and therefore support drug
development of the ADCs targeting TENB2 and STEAP1.
To test this we examined the tumor growth inhibition
properties of ADCs targeting these antigens in a panel
of patient-derived prostate cancer models. Results were
compared with parallel immunoPET studies performed
to quantify tumor uptake of the corresponding mAbs
targeting TENB2 and STEAP1 in the same tumor models.
Both efficacy and imaging studies used anti-gD as an
isotype-matched non-specific control antibody.

Radiolabeling of TENB2, STEAP1 and gD
targeting mAbs
In and 89Zr radiolabeled mAbs targeting TENB2,
STEAP1 and gD all showed greater than 90% radiochemical
purity. Binding was essentially unaltered in the potency
assays for anti-TENB2 (IC50 of 1.03 ± 0.17 versus 0.96
± 0.09 nM before and after radiolabeling respectively) and
anti-STEAP1 (2.50 ± 0.09 versus 1.95 ± 0.15 nM).

Dose dependence of tumor uptake with
111
In-labeled anti-STEAP1
Dose-dependent tumor uptake was measured for
In-anti-STEAP1. Figure 1A shows the absolute tumor
uptake (μg mAb per g tumor tissue) which was highest for
the highest dose level tested, 40 mg/kg. Figure 1B shows
the relative tumor uptake (expressed as %ID/g) which was
highest at the 0.08 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg dose
levels.

Tracer tumor uptake and ADC tumor growth
inhibition studies
Tumor tracer uptake of 111In labeled TENB2,
STEAP1 and gD mAbs showed varying results (Figure 2).
For all tumors, specific tumor uptake was observed relative
to the non-specific gD control (P < 0.05). For TENB2,
highest tumor uptake of 96.1 ± 2.8 %ID/g was measured
in LuCaP77 tumors, the lowest (12.2 ± 1.6 %ID/g) in
LuCaP35V. The anti-TENB2 tracer uptake in LuCaP70

%ID/g. For STEAP1 ADC tumor uptake, highest values
(38.7 ± 1.5 %ID/g) were measured in LuCaP35V tumors,
lowest tumor uptake in LuCaP96.1 tumors (4.7 ± 0.3
%ID/g). LuCaP70 and LuCaP77 tumors showed an uptake
of 8.2 ± 0.3 %ID/g and 18.8 ± 0.6 %ID/g respectively.

Efficacy studies used tumor volumes measured over
4-7 weeks following TENB2 or STEAP1 ADC MMAEconjugated drug treatment. LuCaP70 and LuCaP96.1
tumors were sensitive for TENB2 ADC treatment, whereas
in LuCaP77 efficacy of this ADC was relatively poor as
tumors started to regrow. STEAP1 ADC was efficacious

each group. Tumor uptake was higher in mice administered
89
Zr–anti-TENB2 or 89Zr–anti-STEAP1 compared to mice
given the control mAb 89Zr–anti-gD (p < 0.05); the exception
was 89Zr-anti-STEAP1 uptake in LuCaP96.1 tumors which
was no higher than control. 89Zr tumor uptake as determined
by PET quantification correlated with the 111In labeled mAb
biodistribution studies (R2 = 0.85).

Comparable results were found for TENB2 and STEAP1

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to demonstrate a correlation between tumor uptake of a
89
Zr antibody and ADC tumor growth inhibition. In four
different patient-derived prostate cancer models, with
varying TENB2 and STEAP1 expression, immunoPET
predicts MMAE-conjugated ADC treatment efficacy.

ADC treatment is a promising new approach for
anti-cancer treatment. However, without imaging to
confirm good mAb uptake, disappointing response rates
might be attributed to any combination of poor tissue
penetration, absence of target, failure to bind target, lack
of internalization, or drug resistance [1]. A lack of mAb
uptake not explained by pharmacokinetic exposure may
indicate a poor choice of target antigen or indicate a need
to revise the mAb molecule. In contrast, a lack of drug
efficacy observed in spite of visualizing strong tumor
uptake may indicate the presence of active drug resistance
mechanisms and suggest the need to try a different toxin.
In LuCaP35V tumors the anti-TENB2-MMAE
ADC was ineffective which correlated with the low tracer
uptake and target expression. In LuCaP70, LuCaP77
and LuCaP96.1 tumors anti-TENB2-MMAE ADC was
efficacious, showing tumor growth inhibition. These
tumors had at least moderate expression of TENB2
based on ex vivo immunohistochemistry and FACS
tumor analysis. However, in the LuCaP77 tumor model,
despite particularly high levels of 111In-TENB2 uptake,
ADC efficacy was relatively poor as tumors started
to regrow. Based on the observed tumor uptake level
of 96 %ID/g (Figure 2) approximately 800 nmol of
TENB2 mAb was delivered per kg of tumor tissue. This
should have delivered MMAE considerably in excess
of the IC50 concentration range for free toxin of 0.2 to
2 nM determined in vitro [3]. Even allowing for partial
deconjugation of the ADC in circulation and rapid loss
of MMAE catabolites from the tumor tissue, this still
suggests that the amount of MMAE delivered to the
tumor tissue should have been sufficient to inhibit tumor

89

growth. Poor MMAE efficacy in the LuCaP77 model may
implicate some MMAE-selective resistance mechanism
mediated by certain efflux pumps or multidrug resistance
of these tumors [16, 17].
STEAP1 expression also correlated with ADC
treatment effect, as LuCaP35V and LuCaP70 tumors were
sensitive to anti-STEAP1-MMAE ADC treatment. In the
LuCaP70 model 111In-anti-STEAP1 uptake was the lowest
(8.2 %ID/g) accompanied by tumor growth inhibition.
This level of MMAE delivery was an order of magnitude
less than that discussed above for anti-TENB2 in LuCap77
tumors, but was clearly sufficient to result in potency in
sufficiently sensitive tumors.
While LuCaP77 tumors show high expression
of TENB2 and STEAP1 these tumors did not respond
to therapy. No metric of target expression predicted the
degree of drug resistance that was encountered in these
tumors. With the immunoPET data, there is powerful
evidence of active tumor delivery of mAb in vivo, which
provides a rationale for considering the use of the same
mAb armed with alternative toxins, or entirely different
cell-death effector moieties such as radioisotopes [18].
Although the presence of a receptor does not preclude
resistance in clinical practice, establishing the presence
or absence of an antigen is of tremendous importance.
When there is no cellular uptake of 89Zr-mAb, no efficacy
of mAb-MMAE can be expected. Clearly, the negative
predictive value is greater than the positive predictive
value, which is especially the case for ADCs. Therefore,
establishing tumor uptake and TENB2 or STEAP1
presence may well have value in choosing appropriate
treatments in the future.

In conclusion, quantitative data from immunoPET
measuring relative mAb uptake patterns of TENB2and STEAP1-targeting mAbs predict to a degree tumor
growth inhibition by an ADC. ImmunoPET’s capacity
to demonstrate the essential aspects of ADC delivery,
binding and internalization in vivo offers advantages
complementary to existing tools. ImmunoPET may
thus help confirm the necessary prerequisites for
efficacy with particular mAb-target combinations.
It may also identify changes in target expression or
function (internalization) from genetic or treatmentinduced effects. These studies were sufficiently
encouraging to enter a research collaboration with
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to advance
this preclinical research into phase I clinical studies
of 89Zr-anti-STEAP1 uptake in metastatic castration
resistant prostate cancer patients (www.clinicaltrials.
gov, #NCT01774071) [19].

described [22]. For immunoPET imaging, naked mAbs
(without MMAE) were conjugated through side-chain
lysines with a desferrioxamine B (Macrocyclics) chelating
group using the benzyl isothiocyanate reagent and
radiolabeled with 89Zr [7, 23, 24].
Quality control of the conjugated and radiolabeled
mAbs was performed using size exclusion high-pressure
liquid chromatography, measuring radiochemical purity
and the presence of aggregates or fragments. Retention
of antigen binding was tested using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISA). For this a microplate
was coated with TENB2 or STEAP1 extracellular domain.
After coating, 0.5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA)
in PBS was added to the microplates and incubated at 4 °C
for 1 h. After washing, the conjugated mAbs were added
in concentrations ranging from 40 ng/ml to 0.066 ng/ml
(in PBS + 0.05% BSA) and incubated for 1 h at ambient
temperature. Thereafter 100 μl of 5 ng/ml anti-IgG FabHRP was added to each microplate well and incubated
for 1 h. After washing, 100 μl of SureBlue ReserveTM
was added to each microplate well for 15 min at ambient
temperature. Before measuring the optical density at 450
nm for detection and 650 nm for absorbance, 100 μl of 0.6
N sulfuric acid was added. A 4-parameter logistic curve
fitting program was used to generate separate curves for
each control (not conjugated) or conjugated mAbs. Based
on this the potency was calculated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
All applicable international, national and/or
institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals
were followed.

Antibody-drug conjugates

Patient-derived xenograft models

For tumor growth inhibition studies, mAbs against
TENB2 (Pr1, affinity 2.3 nM) and STEAP1 (MSTP2109A;
affinity 2.4 nM) were conjugated with the auristatin
moiety MC-vc-PAB-MMAE as previously described [3].
These mAbs were engineered to have exactly two sitespecific thiol residues available for conjugation [20]. The
average drug-to-mAb ratio was 1.8-2.0 MMAE per mAb.
The HSV-1 viral coat protein gD was used as non-binding
isotype control reagent (anti-gD) as this antigen is absent
in mice. Anti-gD was also conjugated with MMAE. Toxin
conjugation via the engineered thiols was previously
shown not to significantly alter their antigen binding or
pharmacokinetics [21].

Patient-derived human prostate cancer tissues
(LuCaP35V, LuCaP70, LuCaP77, and LuCaP96.1)
were kindly provided by Dr. R. Vessella (University of
Washington). LuCaP35V is an androgen independent
variant of LuCaP35 isolated from an inguinal lymph node
metastasis [25]. LuCaP70, LuCaP77 and LuCaP96.1 were
derived from liver, femur metastases or prostate tissue,
respectively [26]. The patient-derived tumors have varying
expression of TENB2 and STEAP1 that was determined
ex vivo, as described below.
The LuCaP70, LuCaP77 and LuCaP96.1 patient
derived xenografts were established through serial
subcutaneous implantations of 20-30 mm3 tumor
fragments in intact male CB17 SCID-beige mice.
LuCaP35V was propagated in castrated mice (Charles
River Laboratories). For all experiments mice were
age matched and inoculated with the same tumors
and designated into separate cohorts. Experiments
were conducted more than a year apart in time and
consequently on cohorts of tumors with somewhat
different numbers of passages and growth properties
because of the logistics of working with patient-derived
xenograft models.
All animal studies were conducted in accordance to
the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at Genentech, Inc.

Radiolabeling of TENB2, STEAP1 and gD
targeting mAbs
For ex vivo tumor uptake measurements, naked
mAbs (without MMAE) were labeled. The naked mAb
was chosen because the biology being interrogated
(delivery, target binding, internalization) is independent
of the drug conjugation, whereas using the ADC for
radiolabeling introduces additional technical and logistical
challenges to the experiment with essentially no benefit.
Indium-111 (111In) chelation was performed using
2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
acid (DTPA; Macrocyclics) by methods previously

Dose-escalation pilot studies of 111In-labeled
anti-STEAP1

Region of interest measurements defined by using
software tools were made on multiple axial slices of the
tissues using IRW software (Siemens). Decay-corrected
signal intensity of tumor was measured as percentage of
the injected dose per gram (%ID/g), assuming a tissue
density of 1 ml per 1 gram soft tissue.

The dose escalation study of 111In-anti-TENB2 was
previously reported [23]. For the dose escalation study of
111
In-anti-STEAP1, LuCAP35V tumor bearing mice were
dosed intravenously with approximately 0.18 MBq 111Inlabeled anti-STEAP1 (90 MBq/mg). Labeled tracer was
mixed with cold mAb protein to achieve final dose levels
of 0.08 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 40 mg/
kg of STEAP1 per mouse (n = 5 per group). Tissues were
harvested three days post-injection for gamma counting
with the Wallac Wizard 1480 Automatic Gamma Counter
(Perkin-Elmer).

Ex vivo tumor analysis
Tumor samples used for ex vivo characterization
of target expression levels were derived from tumor
fragments with the same number of passages and in
the same cohort of mice and as were used for efficacy
studies.
Immunohistochemical
determination
of
antigen expression was performed on 4 μm sections
from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. The
primary mAbs used for immunohistochemistry were
chosen because of their ability to detect antigen in
fixed tissue and they were not the same mAbs used
in experiments with live animals or unfixed tissues.
Staining for TENB2 was performed on the Discovery
XT autostainer (Ventana Medical Systems). Tissue
sections were incubated in 2.5 μg/ml humanized antiTENB2 primary mAb, clone PR-1, and then in 7.5 μg/
ml goat anti-human, biotin conjugated mAb (Vector
Laboratories). Human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch)
was used as a negative control mAb. Detection
was performed utilizing Ventana DabMAP. For
STEAP1, tissue sections were incubated in 10 μg/ml
sheep primary mAb and then in biotinylated donkey
anti-sheep IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch). Tissue
sections were treated with Ventana DABMap™ for
the detection of signals and visualization through
3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a chromogenic peroxidase
substrate. Immunohistochemistry scoring was
performed by a board-certified pathologist and is based
on the intensity of positive staining observed in at least
50% of tumor cells: “negative” indicates no detectable
signal, “1+” indicates a weak signal, “2+” indicates a
moderate signal, and “3+” indicates a strong signal.
For fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
experiments, tumor tissues were harvested, chopped
and macerated in cell dissociation buffer (Gibco-BRL,
#13151014), strained and washed with FACS buffer (1%
FBS and 2mM EDTA in PBS). Cells were centrifuged
at 4°C and resuspended in 20 ml ACK lysis buffer (163
mM NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, 0.1 mM EDTA pH 7.4)
again centrifuged and resuspended into FACS buffer
before being dispensed into a 96-well plate where they
were incubated for one hour on ice with 3 mg/ml mAbs
(unlabeled mAbs targeting TENB2 or STEAP1). After
washing, 2 mg/ml of a secondary anti-human IgG-Fc
domain PE mAb was added and incubated on ice for
an additional hour. Cells were washed three times and
resuspended in 100 ml of FACS buffer with 0.5 mg/ml PI
and analyzed using a FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer (BD).

Tumor tracer uptake and ADC growth inhibition
studies
Cut-and-count tumor tracer uptake studies were
performed in LuCaP35V, LuCaP70, LuCaP77, and
LuCaP96.1 patient-derived xenografts (n = 4-5 per group)
following the intravenous injection of a single dose (5 mg/
kg) of mAb targeting TENB2, STEAP1, or gD (isotype
control) radiolabeled with 111In (0.18-0.74 MBq). Ex
vivo analysis was performed three days post-injection
of tracer to allow for tissue uptake, mAb internalization,
and sufficient background clearance. Tumors were
harvested, blot-dried, and weighed for gamma counting
with background subtraction and decay correction against
dosing solution standards.
Tumor growth inhibition was also studied in
LuCaP35V, LuCaP70, LuCaP77, and LuCaP96.1 patientderived xenografts following a single dose of 5 mg/kg
(same dose as for tracer above) of the ADCs targeting
TENB2, STEAP1 or gD (isotype control). This dose was
chosen because it was efficacious in sensitive models yet
well-tolerated by the animals in previous studies (data
not shown). ADCs were administered intravenously via
the tail vein (n = 8-10 per group). Tumor volume growth
was monitored for up to 70 days. Tumor length (l, the
longest dimension) and width (w, perpendicular to the
length) were measured by calipers; tumor volume V was
approximated as V = lw2/2.

PET imaging
Zr-PET imaging studies of tumor tracer uptake were
performed after the intravenous injection of a single dose
of 5 mg/kg of the mAbs targeting TENB2, STEAP1, or gD
(isotype control) radiolabeled with 89Zr (3.7 MBq; 30 MBq/
mg), in LuCaP35V, LuCaP70, LuCaP77, and LuCaP96.1
patient-derived xenografts (n = 3-5 per group). PET imaging
was conducted five days later using Siemens Inveon PET/
CT scanners (Siemens). Animals were lightly anesthetized
for restraint with approximately 3.5% sevoflurane, and body
temperature was maintained at 37 °C by warm airflow. PET
scans were 15-30 minute static scans.
