Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with a poor
prognosis due to late diagnoses and a lack of effective
treatment options. Epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR)–targeted therapies have been effective in other
cancers. However, erlotinib and cetuximab have shown only
modest efficacy in clinical trials of HCC. We examined
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as a determinant
of sensitivity of HCC to EGFR inhibitors. A panel of 12 human
hepatoma cell lines were classified as epithelial or mesenchymal based on their expression of E-cadherin and vimentin.
The resulting classification correlated with a previous microarray analysis of human hepatoma cell lines whereby the
mesenchymal cell lines were shown to have increased
expression of genes involved in metastasis and invasion.
Sensitivity to erlotinib, gefitinib, and cetuximab was assessed
and the epithelial cell lines were found to be significantly
more susceptible to all three agents. Analysis of the EGFR
pathway showed that EMT status was independent of EGFR
expression or downstream extracellular signal–regulated
kinase activation and only the epithelial cell lines expressed
ErbB3. Interestingly, mesenchymal cells resistant to EGFR
inhibitors had increased AKT and signal transducer and
activator of transcription-3 activation through elevated
expression of integrin-linked kinase (ILK). Mesenchymal cell
lines were therefore experimentally transformed with kinaseinactive ILK (KI-ILK) with a resulting decrease in ILK activity
and activation of AKT. KI-ILK transformants showed increased sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors both in vitro and in an
in vivo xenograft model. These data suggest that EMT predicts
HCC sensitivity to EGFR-targeted therapies and that ILK is a
novel target to overcome HCC resistance to EGFR inhibition.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common solid
tumor and the third leading cause of cancer-related death
worldwide (1). The prognosis of HCC patients remains poor
because most patients present with advanced disease and are not
candidates for liver transplantation, surgical resection, or regional

therapy (2). Systemic therapies have been largely ineffective, and as
such, new treatment options are needed (3).
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has emerged as a
promising chemotherapeutic target because it is overexpressed in a
wide range of cancers and plays important roles in cell growth and
survival (4). Several drugs that target EGFR have emerged including
the small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, erlotinib and
gefitinib, and a monoclonal antibody directed against EGFR,
cetuximab (5). Previous reports document EGFR overexpression in
HCC (6), thereby suggesting a role in tumor progression. Consistent
with this, gefitinib was shown to prevent HCC development in a rat
model of cirrhosis (7). Unfortunately, however, in recent clinical
trials, erlotinib improved disease control in only a minority of
patients with advanced HCC (8, 9) and no responses were seen
after treatment with cetuximab (10). Given the need for more
effective treatments for HCC and the observation that EGFRtargeted therapies have been so effective in other cancers, we
analyzed mechanisms of resistance in HCC cells.
In non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR expression and
amplification (11, 12), as well as activating mutations in the kinase
domain of EGFR (13, 14), correlate with clinical responsiveness to
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. However, the EGFR activating
mutations predictive of response in NSCLC cells are absent in HCC.
Direct sequencing of exons 18 to 21 of EGFR revealed no mutations
in 89 HCC patients from Taiwan (15) and 120 patients from France
(16). Two recent reports have suggested that epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) predicts in vitro sensitivity and
clinical activity of erlotinib in NSCLC (17, 18) whereas another
report has shown a correlation between EMT and erlotinib
sensitivity in pancreatic and colorectal tumor cell lines (19).
Similar results have been reported for gefitinib sensitivity in cell
lines from NSCLC (20), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(20), and bladder cancer (21). Consistent with these studies,
restoration of E-cadherin expression increases sensitivity to
gefitinib in NSCLC (22).
EMT was originally defined as the formation of mesenchymal
cells from epithelia in different embryonic territories. EMT is now
known to also occur in a variety of diseases including the
progression of cancer (23, 24). EMT is characterized by the
combined loss of epithelial cell junction proteins such as Ecadherin and the gain of mesenchymal markers such as vimentin.
Loss of E-cadherin is considered a hallmark of EMT, and the
consequent disassembly of adherens junctions increases tumor cell
motility and invasiveness. Recent reports suggest that overexpression of integrin-linked kinase (ILK; ref. 25) in epithelial cells
induces EMT by repressing E-cadherin expression, activating
nuclear h-catenin, and inducing a transformed, tumorigenic
phenotype (26).

Cancer Research

Previous reports have shown that erlotinib, gefitinib, and
cetuximab induce apoptosis in human hepatoma cell lines (27–29).
In the current study, we analyzed the role of EMT in HCC sensitivity
to EGFR-targeted therapies. We observed that mesenchymal cells
are less susceptible to EGFR inhibition than epithelial cells. This
resistance is at least partly due to ILK overexpression in
mesenchymal cells, and ILK inhibition is a novel mechanism to
overcome resistance to EGFR inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Cells and culture conditions. Human hepatoma cell lines (SNU-182,
SNU-387, SNU-398, SNU-423, SNU-449, and SNU-475) were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection. The hepatoma cell lines SK-Hep,
PLC/PRF/5, HepG2, and Hep3B were kindly provided by Barrie Bode
(Saint Louis University, St. Louis, MO), whereas HuH-7 was provided by
Jake Liang (National Institutes of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney
Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, MD), and Focus by Jack Wands (Brown University,
Providence, RI). All the cell lines were propagated in DMEM (4.5 mg/mL
glucose, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine) with 10% fetal bovine serum (both
from MediaTech CellGro), supplemented with 100 units/mL penicillin and
100 mg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at 37jC in a
humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in air. Stock solutions of erlotinib
(Tarceva, Genentech) and gefitinib (Iressa, AstraZeneca) were prepared in
DMSO and stored at 20jC. Cetuximab (Erbitux, ImClone Systems) was
supplied as a 2 mg/mL stock and PBS was used as a vehicle control.
Real-time PCR. Human hepatoma cells were plated at 1  105/mL in
10-mL medium in a 100-mm plate and allowed to grow for 48 h to represent
log-phase growth. Total RNA was extracted from each cell line with TRIzol
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and subsequently
treated with DNase I (Promega). Total RNA (250 ng) from each sample was
used to create cDNA by single strand reverse transcription [SuperScript III
First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen) for quantitative real-time
PCR (RT-PCR)]. All of the sample cDNAs were pooled together to create
a quantitative standard control. Expression of E-cadherin, vimentin,
a-fetoprotein (AFP), CD44, and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) mRNA
in the human hepatoma cell lines was analyzed by quantitative real-time
PCR (LightCycler, Roche Diagnostics Corporation). mRNA expression
present was normalized to the expression of h-actin. Primer sequences
are as follows: E-cadherin, forward AGTGGGCACAGATGGTGTGA and
reverse TAGGTGGAGTCCCAGGCGTA; vimentin, forward CCTCACCTGTGAAGTGGATGC and reverse CAACGGCAAAGTTCTCTTCCA; AFP, forward
TGCAGCCAAAGTGAAGAGGGAAGA and reverse CATAGCGAGCAGCCCAAAGAAGAA; CD44, forward CAACTCCATCTGTGCAGCAAA and reverse
GTAACCTCCTGAAGTGCTGCTC; IGF-II, forward CCCCTCCGACCGTGCT
and reverse TCATATTGGAAGAACTTGCCCA; and actin, forward
CCTGGACTTCGAGCAAGAGAT and reverse GCCGATCCACACGGAGTACT.
All reactions were done in duplicate and the experiment was repeated to
ensure reproducible results.
Western blotting. Cell lines were plated as described above and, after
48 h, the cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and harvested in 500 AL of
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Boston BioProducts) containing
protease inhibitors (Sigma). Protein concentration of lysates was analyzed
by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Pierce Chemical Co.). Cellular
lysates (30 Ag) were prepared in Laemmli’s reducing sample buffer (Boston
BioProducts), separated by electrophoresis on 4% to 20% polyacrylamide
gradient gels (Cambrex Bio Science), and transferred electrophoretically
onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Nonspecific binding
on the membrane was blocked with TBS/0.1% Tween 20 (TBS/T) containing
5% bovine serum albumin. Membranes were incubated with primary
antibodies overnight at 4jC and with appropriate secondary antibodies
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP; GE Healthcare) for 1 h at room
temperature. After each incubation period, membranes were washed thrice
with TBS/T. Immunoreactive bands were visualized on X-ray film (Denville
Scientific) with a chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Perkin-Elmer). Relative
levels of total and phosphorylated proteins were determined by Western

blot analysis with the following antibodies: E-cadherin, HER3/ErbB3 (1B2),
p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase [extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (ERK)], phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), AKT, phospho-AKT (Ser473),
signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), phospho-STAT3
(Tyr705), ILK1, IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR)-h (all from Cell Signaling Technology),
EGFR, and vimentin (both from BD Biosciences). An antibody directed
against h-actin (Abcam) was used to verify equal loading. Band intensities
were quantified by image analysis software (LabWorks 4.5, UVP, Inc.). Each
Western blot was repeated to ensure reproducible results.
Cell growth assay. Briefly, cells were plated in triplicate at a density of
4  104/mL in a 24-well plate. After 24 h, cells were washed once with PBS
and medium containing inhibitors at the indicated concentrations or
vehicle control was added. After 72 h, the effect of each EGFR inhibitor on
the growth of human hepatoma cells was measured by colorimetric
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) assay.
The absorbance at 562 nm was measured with a spectrophotometric plate
reader (Emax, Molecular Devices) and the experiment was repeated twice
for each cell line. IC50 value is defined as the drug concentration yielding
50% nonsurviving cells compared with vehicle-treated controls, and the
percent of maximal inhibition is calculated at the highest concentration for
each drug.
Hepatoma cell transfection. SK-Hep and SNU-449 cells were transfected with pUSEamp (empty vector) and ILK S343A (kinase-inactive; both
from UpState) with Lipofectamine 2000 in OptiMEM serum-free medium
(both from Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s suggestions. Cells
were transferred 48 h later into 150-mm tissue culture plates and
maintained in selective growth medium supplemented with 1,200 Ag/mL
geneticin (Invitrogen). Individual colonies were isolated 7 to 10 d later and
candidate clones were identified by PCR with primers spanning the multiple
cloning site of pUSEamp. The primer sequences used are as follows:
pUSEamp forward, TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG; reverse, CAACAGATGGCTGGCAACTA.
ILK kinase assay. ILK activity was measured as previously described
(30). Briefly, cells were plated at 1  105/mL in 10-mL medium and grown to
log phase. After rinsing in PBS, cells were harvested in cell lysis buffer (Cell
Signaling) containing 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, briefly
sonicated, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4jC. Equivalent
amounts (250 Ag) of the supernatant were immunoprecipitated overnight
with 2 Ag of mouse monoclonal anti-ILK antibody (Upstate) at 4jC.
Immune complexes were isolated with protein A/G agarose beads (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and washed twice with cell lysis buffer and kinase
buffer (Cell Signaling). The pellet was resuspended in kinase buffer
supplemented with 200 Amol/L ATP and 2 Ag of glycogen synthase kinase
(GSK)-3 fusion protein (Cell Signaling) and incubated for 30 min at 30jC.
Phosphorylation of the substrate was detected by Western blot with a
phospho-GSK-3a/h (Ser21/9) antibody (Cell Signaling).
Caspase assays. Specific activity of caspase-3 was measured in cellular
extracts with a colorimetric kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(CaspACE, Promega). Cells were plated in 6-cm plates (Corning) at a density
of 1  105/mL, allowed to grow for 2 d, and subsequently treated with the
experimental conditions for the indicated times. After the incubations, cells
were lysed and protein extracts were collected. In this assay, the caspase-3
recognition sequence peptide (DEVD) conjugated to the chromophore
paranitroanaline (pNA) is cleaved by the activated enzyme, and the
liberated pNA is quantified by spectrophotometric absorbance at 405 nm.
The pNA released was normalized to total protein content in the lysates by
the BCA method, and results are expressed as picomoles of pNA released
per microgram of protein per hour.
Animal model. Six- to eight-week-old BALB/c nu /nu mice (Charles
River Laboratories) were maintained in accordance with the institutional
guidelines of the Massachusetts General Hospital animal care facility.
SK-Hep cells transformed with either pUSEamp (empty vector) or ILK S343A
(kinase-inactive) were injected s.c. into the flank area of mice (5  106/
100 AL of PBS). Groups 1 and 2 were injected with SK-Hep pUSEamp cells,
whereas groups 3 and 4 were injected with SK-Hep ILK S343A cells. When
tumors had reached 50 mm3, mice were randomized into two treatment
groups of eight mice each. Groups 1 and 3 received vehicle solution and

groups 2 and 4 received 80 mg/kg gefitinib, both for 5 d/wk by i.p. injection.
Tumor volumes were measured 3 d/wk for 1 mo using a caliper and the
following formula: V = (smaller diameter)2  (large diameter) / 2. Mice were
euthanized at the end of the study.
Statistical analysis. A Student’s t test was used to compare the IC50
values and overall response of epithelial cells to those of mesenchymal cells,
as well as those of the KI-ILK transformants to those of empty vector
controls. Similarly, a Student’s t test was used to compare caspase-3
activation in KI-ILK transformants to that in empty vector controls after
treatment with EGFR inhibitors as well as tumor volumes after treatment
with vehicle or gefitinib.

Results
Characterization of EMT in human hepatoma cell lines. The
expression of E-cadherin and vimentin was assessed for each of the
human hepatoma cell lines to determine their extent of EMT. Five
of the cell lines (SNU-423, HepG2, Hep3B, HuH-7, and PLC/PRF/5)
were classified as epithelial based on their expression of E-cadherin
by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). Conversely, seven of the cell lines
(SNU-182, SNU-387, SNU-475, Focus, SK-Hep, SNU-449, and SNU398) were considered to be mesenchymal because they lack
E-cadherin, although these cell lines express vimentin at varying
levels (Fig. 1A). Results of quantitative real-time PCR measurement
of E-cadherin and vimentin mRNA were consistent with the
Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B).

Microarray analysis of human hepatoma cell lines by Lee and
Thorgeirsson (31) reveals two distinctive subtypes. Group I is
characterized by the activation of oncofetal promoters leading to
increased expression of AFP and IGF-II. Group II is characterized
by overexpression of genes involved in metastasis and invasion,
such as CD44 and ILK. We examined AFP and CD44 expression by
quantitative real-time PCR in all 12 human hepatomas as
compared with primary cultures of human hepatocytes (Fig. 1C).
Notably, AFP expression was up-regulated in four of the epithelial
hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, HuH-7, and PLC/PRF/5) and
similar to expression in normal hepatocytes in the other epithelial
cell line (SNU-423). By comparison, expression of AFP was
extremely down-regulated in the mesenchymal cell lines. Conversely, expression of CD44 was elevated in the mesenchymal cells
and down-regulated in the epithelial cell lines compared with
normal hepatocytes. Relative to normal hepatocytes, AFP expression was highest in the HuH-7 cell line (513-fold greater) and lowest
in SK-Hep (>1,000-fold less), whereas CD44 was highest in SNU-449
(16-fold greater) and lowest in HepG2 (720-fold less). Thus, EMT
strongly correlates with previously described HCC subtypes that
are based on invasive gene expression profiles.
Response of human hepatoma cell lines to EGFR inhibition.
As previous reports have shown a strong correlation between
response to EGFR inhibitors and E-cadherin expression in other
cell types, we examined the effects of EGFR-targeted therapies on

NOTE: Percent of maximal inhibition was calculated for the highest dose for each drug (20 Amol/L for erlotinib and gefitinib and 1,000 Ag/mL for
cetuximab). Student’s t test was done to compare the responses of the five epithelial cell lines to the seven mesenchymal ones.

the growth of human hepatoma cell lines. Similar to the previous
results, E-cadherin expression strongly correlates with susceptibility to erlotinib, gefitinib, and cetuximab in hepatoma cells (Table 1).
For example, SNU-423, the cell line with the highest expression of
E-cadherin, was far more susceptible to EGFR inhibition by all
three agents than SNU-398, a mesenchymal cell line with the
highest expression of vimentin. Compared with the result from all
seven mesenchymal hepatoma cell lines, the IC50 values of the five
epithelial cell lines were significantly lower whereas the overall
responses were significantly greater for the three EGFR inhibitors.
It should be noted, however, that one mesenchymal cell line, SNU182, was slightly sensitive whereas the epithelial cell line HuH-7
showed some resistance.
Analysis of IGF-II/IGF-IR signaling in human hepatoma cells.
The IGF-IR pathway has been shown to mediate resistance to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors in NSCLC (32, 33) as well as breast (34)
and glioblastoma (35) cell lines. Further, a previous report suggests
that IGF-II signaling through IGF-IR may result in resistance to
gefitinib in hepatoma cells (36). We therefore correlated IGF-IR and
IGF-II expression with EMT status in the 12 hepatoma cell lines.
Expression of IGF-IR was observed in both sensitive epithelial cell
lines and resistant mesenchymal ones (Fig. 2A). However, elevated
expression of IGF-II was only observed in some of the sensitive
epithelial cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, and HuH-7; Fig. 2B) where this
pathway seems to mediate some resistance especially in HuH-7
cells. Thus, IGF-II/IGF-IR signaling does not seem to be consistently associated with resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in
mesenchymal HCC cells.
Mesenchymal cell lines have increased AKT and STAT3
expression and elevated levels of ILK. To further investigate the
signaling pathways that may be responsible for the effects of EMT
on susceptibility to EGFR-targeted therapies in HCC cells, Western
blot analysis was used to analyze the signaling pathways
downstream of EGFR under normal growth conditions (Fig. 2A).
All 12 hepatoma cell lines exhibit increased growth and EGFR
signaling in response to EGF stimulation (data not shown).
Interestingly, EMT status was independent of total EGFR levels

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (7). April 1, 2008

and downstream ERK activation. A minor association between
total EGFR expression and ERK activation was observed. With few
exceptions, the mesenchymal cell lines were observed to have
increased activation of AKT and STAT3. The activation of AKT in
mesenchymal cells was not due to signaling from EGFR-ErbB3
heterodimers because ErbB3 expression was observed only in
epithelial cell lines, as has previously been reported in NSCLC
(17, 18).
ILK is up-regulated in mesenchymal hepatoma cell lines (31) and
is known to phosphorylate and activate AKT (37) and promote cell
survival. Inhibition of ILK activity in human pancreatic cancer
xenografts results in decreased activation of AKT and STAT3 but
not ERK (38), similar to the differences observed between epithelial
and mesenchymal cells. We therefore examined ILK expression in
the 12 hepatoma cell lines. Notably, increased ILK expression was
restricted to mesenchymal cells, with the exception of one
epithelial cell line (SNU-423; Fig. 2A). Compared with the
expression in the five epithelial cell lines, ILK protein level in the
seven mesenchymal cell lines was significantly (P < 0.01) 2.2-fold
higher by densitometric analysis (Fig. 2C).
Inhibition of ILK decreases AKT activation and induces
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. To further investigate the
role of ILK in the observed resistance of mesenchymal cells to
EGFR-targeted therapy, we transfected the mesenchymal cell lines
SK-Hep and SNU-449 with a plasmid containing a KI-ILK (ILK
S343A). Transformed clones expressing either the KI-ILK or the
empty vector controls were isolated (Fig. 3A). KI-ILK–transformed
clones were observed to have less ILK activity compared with
empty vector controls as measured by a kinase activity assay
(Fig. 3B). Corresponding with this reduction in ILK activity,
KI-ILK–transformed SK-Hep and SNU-449 cells had a 47% and
41% reduction in AKT activation, respectively (Fig. 3C). Importantly, the KI-ILK–transformed SK-Hep and SNU-449 cells also
underwent a partial mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. Compared with the empty vector controls, E-cadherin mRNA expression
was increased 397- and 360-fold in the SK-Hep and SNU-449 KI-ILK
transformants, respectively (Fig. 3D). Correspondingly, a 14- and

EMT and ILK Mediate Sensitivity to EGFR Inhibition

3-fold decrease in vimentin mRNA expression was observed in the
SK-Hep and SNU-449 KI-ILK transformants as compared with the
empty vector clones.
Inhibition of ILK restores sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. Of
significant interest, KI-ILK–transformed cells were also more
susceptible to EGFR inhibition (Table 2). The IC50 values for
SK-Hep KI-ILK were 6.4 and 6.5 Amol/L for erlotinib and gefitinib,
respectively, and these were significantly (P < 0.01) less than those
for the empty vector controls (11.5 and 19.4 Amol/L for erlotinib and
gefitinib, respectively). SK-Hep KI-ILK cells still remained largely
resistant to cetuximab but the overall response increased from 6%
to 25%. Similarly, SNU-449 KI-ILK cells were also only marginally
responsive to cetuximab, with an overall response of 21% compared
with 3% for the empty vector control cells. The IC50 values for SNU449 KI-ILK cells were 9.1 and 11.5 Amol/L for erlotinib and gefitinib,
respectively, and these were significantly (P < 0.01) less than the
corresponding controls, which had IC50 >20 Amol/L.
Previous reports have shown that EGFR inhibitors induce
apoptosis in hepatoma cell lines (27–29). We next examined the
apoptotic response of the KI-ILK transformants as compared with
the empty vector controls after treatment with erlotinib and
gefitinib. Apoptosis was assessed by activation of caspase-3.
Consistent with the IC50 data, caspase-3 activity in general was
observed to increase at lower doses of both inhibitors in the KI-ILK
transformants, and the KI-ILK transformants had greater overall
caspase-3 activity at each individual concentration of erlotinib and

gefitinib tested as compared with the empty vector controls
(Fig. 4A and B).
To determine if the in vitro data were consistent with response
in vivo, we established mouse xenografts with the SK-Hep KI-ILK or
empty vector transformants, and then treated these tumors with
either gefitinib or vehicle. No significant change in growth was
observed when SK-Hep empty vector tumors were treated with
gefitinib at 80 mg/kg (Fig. 4C). However, when the same dose of
gefitinib was used to treat SK-Hep KI-ILK tumors, a significant
reduction in tumor growth was observed (Fig. 4D). After 28 days,
the volume of the SK-Hep KI-ILK tumors treated with gefitinib
were significantly (P = 0.004) 30% less than the controls.
Taken together, these results suggest that ILK is responsible for
the observed increased activation of AKT in mesenchymal
hepatoma cell lines. In addition, whereas other mechanisms of
AKT activation may be operant, inhibition of ILK activity increases
mesenchymal HCC sensitivity to EGFR-targeted therapies.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing
hepatoma cell lines as epithelial or mesenchymal based on their
expression of E-cadherin and vimentin. Interestingly, HCC EMT
strongly correlates with susceptibility to EGFR-targeted therapies
including erlotinib, gefitinib, and cetuximab. Previously, a strong
correlation between EMT and erlotinib sensitivity (17–19) as well as

has previously been reported for NSCLC cells. Some of these
differences may be explained by the fact that the growth curves
reported here were done under normal growth conditions rather
than in low serum with direct activation of EGFR because the
majority of hepatoma cell lines did not grow well under the latter
conditions.
A previous report had suggested that IGF-II/IGF-IR signaling
could lead to gefitinib resistance in the hepatoma cell lines HepG2
and Hep3B (36). These epithelial cell lines, which express IGF-II/
IGF-IR, are responsive to IGF-IR inhibition (39), and combination

gefitinib sensitivity (20, 21) had been reported, and this is the first
study to show a similar correlation for cetuximab. Overall, the
hepatoma cell lines were more responsive to erlotinib and gefitinib
and only marginally responsive to cetuximab. These results are
consistent with data from clinical trials of advanced HCC patients
where 32% (8) and 28% (9) of patients were progression-free at
6 months after treatment with erlotinib compared with 3% after
treatment with cetuximab (10). The IC50 values reported in this
study for hepatoma cell lines are slightly higher than the serum
concentrations observed in patients under treatment and for what

EMT and ILK Mediate Sensitivity to EGFR Inhibition

therapy has been shown to increase susceptibility to EGFR
inhibition in these cells (36). Our results suggest that EMT is the
primary determinant of response to EGFR inhibition in HCC cells.
However, IGF-II/IGF-IR signaling may act as a secondary
mechanism of resistance in a subset of epithelial cells and may
explain why SNU-423 is the most responsive hepatoma cell line to
EGFR-targeted therapies. SNU-423 is epithelial and has low levels
of IGF-II and IGF-IR.
EMT status was independent of both total EGFR levels and
downstream ERK signaling, suggesting that other mechanisms are
responsible for the predictive role of EMT in sensitivity to EGFR
inhibitors. ErbB3 expression was observed only in the epithelial
cells, which is consistent with the findings in NSCLC cells (17, 18).
In a panel of 12 pancreatic and 13 colorectal tumor cell lines,
coexpression of EGFR and ErbB3 was only observed in erlotinibsensitive cells where it mediates AKT signaling (40). Heterodimerization of EGFR-ErbB3 also mediates signaling to AKT in NSCLC
and susceptibility to gefitinib (41). Further, gefitinib was shown to
reduce phospho-AKT levels only in those NSCLC cells where it

inhibits growth. These data suggest that only cells that are
dependent on the EGFR pathway for activation of AKT are sensitive
to EGFR-targeted therapies. Consistent with this, forced expression
of ErbB3 or mutant EGFR does not render resistant cells
susceptible to gefitinib (41) because they have developed
alternative methods for activating AKT.
Therefore, it is likely that the epithelial cells are more susceptible
to EGFR-targeted therapies due to their activation of AKT primarily
through EGFR-ErbB3. Mesenchymal cells activate AKT through
alternative pathways like ILK (42) and are largely resistant to EGFR
inhibitors. ILK is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is localized
at the focal adhesion and interacts with the cytoplasmic domains
of h1 and h3 integrins. The kinase activity of ILK is stimulated by
growth factor stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases or by
engagement of integrins to the extracellular matrix (ECM; ref. 43).
Interestingly, exposure of hepatoma cells to the ECM protein
laminin 5 increases resistance to gefitinib (44).
Recent reports suggest that overexpression of ILK induces EMT
by repressing E-cadherin expression (26), and conversely, inhibition

after treatment with increasing concentrations (2, 5, and 10 Amol/L) of erlotinib (A) or gefitinib (B ). The results are expressed as the percent increase as compared
with untreated cells. The percent increase of caspase-3 activity elicited by each individual concentration of EGFR inhibitor in the empty vector controls was compared with
the percent increase elicited by that same concentration in the KI-ILK transformants by Student’s t test (*, P < 0.05). Tumor growth curves of SK-Hep empty vector

of ILK has been shown to induce E-cadherin expression (45). The
key mechanism by which ILK regulates E-cadherin levels is through
the inhibition of E-cadherin transcription (43). Therefore, we used
quantitative real-time PCR to examine the expression of E-cadherin
mRNA in the SK-Hep and SNU-449 KI-ILK transformants and
observed a dramatic up-regulation as compared with the empty
vector controls. Interestingly, the KI-ILK transformants also had
decreased mRNA levels of vimentin, suggesting that they had
undergone a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. Further, our
data suggest that inhibition of ILK leads to decreased AKT
activation and increased sensitivity to EGFR-targeted therapies
both in vitro and in an in vivo xenograft model. However, it should
be noted that some AKT activation remains even after transforming cells with KI-ILK, suggesting that other mechanisms of
AKT activation may be operant in mesenchymal cells as well.
Microarray analysis of human hepatoma cell lines reveals two
distinctive subtypes (31). Lee et al. (46) have proposed that human
HCC cell lines retain the genomic alterations of the primary
tumors, and therefore it is not surprising that multiple microarray
studies on primary HCCs have also divided them into two
subgroups (16, 47, 48) with gene expression patterns similar to
what has been reported for the HCC cell lines (31, 49). We found a
strong correlation between EMT and these previously described
subtypes. The epithelial cell lines mostly belonged to group I,
whereas mesenchymal cells belonged to group II characterized by

elevated expression of genes involved in metastasis. These data are
consistent with the recent observation that vimentin overexpression is associated with HCC metastasis (50).
It has been suggested that a limited set of quantitative real-time
PCR reactions may be sufficient to predict prognosis of patients at
the time of HCC diagnosis (47), and we propose that the same
strategy may work to determine sensitivity to chemotherapeutic
regimens. In particular, the data presented here suggest that HCC
cells contain multiple mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-targeted
therapies including EMT mediated through ILK and, to a lesser
extent, IGF-II/IGF-IR signaling. Therefore, patients with epithelial
tumors identified by elevated expression of E-cadherin and ErbB3
may be prime candidates for EGFR-targeted therapies, whereas
combination therapies targeting EGFR and ILK may be required for
more invasive, mesenchymal tumors. Our data support these
hypotheses and merit further examination in clinical studies.
