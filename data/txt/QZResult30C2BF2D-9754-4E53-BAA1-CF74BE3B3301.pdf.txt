ABSTRACT
By a candidate gene approach, we analyzed the promoter methylation (PM) of 8
genes (ARF, TIMP3, RAR-β2, NID2, CCNA1, AIM1, CALCA and CCND2) by quantitative
methylation specific PCR (QMSP) in the DNA of 17 non-recurrent and 19 recurrent
noninvasive low grade papillary urothelial cell carcinoma (LGPUCC) archival tissues.
Among the genes tested, by establishing an empiric cutoff value, CCND2, CCNA1,
NID2, and CALCA showed higher frequency of methylation in recurrent than in nonrecurrent LGPUCC: CCND2 10/19 (53%) vs. 2/17 (12%) (p=0.014); CCNA1 11/19
(58%) vs. 4/17 (23.5%) (p=0.048); NID2 13/19 (68%) vs. 3/17 (18%) (p=0.003)
and CALCA 10/19 (53%) vs. 4/17 (23.5%) (p=0.097), respectively. We further
analyzed PM of CCND2, CCNA1, and CALCA in urine DNA from UCC patients including
LGPUCC and controls. The frequency of CCND2, CCNA1, and CALCA was significantly
higher (p<0.0001) in urine of UCC cases [38/148 (26%), 50/73 (68%) and 94/148
(63.5%) respectively] than controls [0/56 (0%), 10/60 (17%) and 16/56 (28.5%),
respectively)]. Most importantly we found at least one of the 3 markers were
methylated positive in 25 out of 30 (83%) cytology negative LGPUCC cases. We also
explored the biological function of CCNA1 in UCC. Prospective confirmatory studies are
needed to develop a reliable tool for prediction of recurrence using primary LGPUCC
tissues and/or urine.

INTRODUCTION

three times the rate of women, women present with more
advanced disease [2].
Urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) constitutes over
90% of bladder cancers in the Western world. Nonmuscle invasive UCC is the most common at presentation
(around 75%) and is treated by trans-urethral resection

In 2014, approximately 74,690 new cases will be
diagnosed with bladder cancer and about 15,580 people
will die from this disease in the United States [1] .

of bladder tumor (TURBT) with or without BCG where
20% of patients will be cured, 70% will recur at least once
every 5 years, and the remaining will progress to muscleinvasive disease with poor prognosis [3]. Currently,
there are no well validated markers that can discern the
tumors that will recur from those that will not. Moreover,
conventional approaches (computed tomography, urine
cytology, histopathology, or tumor-node-metastasis
classification) are not ideal to predict risk of recurrence.
Hence, it is crucial to develop molecular markers that
can predict recurrence at the time of diagnosis, and that
such markers would allow a more individualized therapy,
and overall management based on a patient’s risk.
Furthermore, it would also be important to develop a test
that could provide cost-effective, non-invasive monitoring
for low-risk patients, while using a more active approach
to identify high-risk cancers before they progress [4].
Numerous potential markers have been proposed, such
as Ki-67, TP53 and TERT, which have some promising
correlation, but no conclusive evidence has been shown
[4, 5].
Cancer is a genetic disease, and in some cancers
such as UCC, environmental factors play an important
role in cancer initiation. Accumulated evidence over the
last two decades also suggest that epigenetic changes play
an essential role in carcinogenesis and contribute to the
development and progression of tumor cells [6]. They
include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and

nucleosome repositioning [7, 8]. DNA methylation is
defined as the addition of a methyl group on a cytosine that
precedes a guanosine (known as CpG). There are CpGrich regions known as CpG islands, which usually span the
5´end region of many genes with tumor suppressor activity
and are usually unmethylated in normal cells [9]. Promoter
methylation is a common mechanism for gene inactivation
[6, 7, 10] and has been found to be a potential biomarker
for several types of cancer, including UCC [11, 12].
In the current study, by a candidate gene approach,
we selected 8 genes (ARF, TIMP3, RAR-β2, NID2, CCNA1,
AIM1, CALCA, and CCND2) that had been previously
shown to be frequently methylated in UCC by our group
and others [11-14], and based on their reported functional
characteristics. Briefly, cyclins belong to a highly
conserved family, and the members are characterized
by a dramatic periodicity in protein abundance through
the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK
kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and
degradation patterns which contribute to the temporal
coordination of each mitotic event [15]. We previously
reported that CCNA1 is frequently methylated in
solid tumors including UCC [11, 16]. Functionally,
CCND2 plays different roles in different cancer types.
While silencing of CCND2  expression by promoter
methylation is associated with cancer progression in
some cancer types [17-20], over-expression of cyclin
D2 correlates with progression and poor prognosis in other
tumor types [21-24]. We selected CCND2 based on our
previous findings in UCC [11]. Similarly, the remaining
genes were selected based on their relationship with cell
growth and known cancer specific methylation in different
solid tumors including UCC [11-14, 25, 26] (further
explored in the discussion section).
In this study, we analyzed 8 genes (ARF, TIMP3,
RAR-β2, NID2, CCNA1, AIM1, CALCA and CCND2)
in a group of retrospectively collected 36 low-grade
papillary urothelial cell carcinoma (LGPUCC) patients
with recurrent and non-recurrent tumors. As methylation
of CCNA1 showed significant correlation with recurrence,
we further explored its biological function in UCC cell
lines in vitro. Finally, we evaluated the feasibility of
detecting UCC (including LGPUCC) in bodily fluids by
analyzing promoter methylation of a panel of three genes
in urine samples obtained from controls (subjects without
any known cancer) and UCC patients; these three genes
had not been tested in urine samples before for detection
of LGPUCC.

cutoff values, CCND2, CCNA1, NID2, and CALCA
showed a significantly higher frequency of methylation in

UCC cases (148 for CCND2, 73 for CCNA1 and 148 for
CALCA) and controls (56 for CCND2, 60 for CCNA1 and
56 for CALCA). Figure 2B shows methylation frequency
of CCNA1, CALCA, and CCND2 in different grades and
stages of urines from UCC cases. When compared to the
current standard method urine cytology (sensitivity of
50% in our cases (44/88), similar to the literature), the
sensitivity is higher for any one of the 3 genes methylated

with a specificity of 70%. Interestingly, 83% (25/30) of
cytology negative LGPUCC cases were positive for one
or more of the three methylation markers tested in urine.
Out of 101 LGUCC cases, cytology data was available
for 70 cases. Detailed information on the methylation and

primary UCC cases and subjects without any neoplastic
disease (controls/normals). By establishing an empiric
cutoff, we found CCND2, CCNA1, and CALCA to be
significantly more methylated in urine of UCC patients
than controls (Table 2B). The methylation frequency of
CCND2, CCNA1, and CALCA were 38/148 (25.6%),

cell lines, promoter methylation of CCNA1 is inversely
correlated with expression in J82 and SW780 (data not
shown). Similarly, for CCND2, we observed that promoter
methylation is inversely correlated with expression in
J82, SW780 and T24 cell lines (data not shown). These
findings suggest that both DNA methylation and histone
deacetylation play a role in CCND2 and CCNA1 genes
silencing.

101 LGUCC cases is shown in Supplementary Table 1.

Re-expression of CCNA1 and CCND2 after 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-aza-dc) and trichostatin A (TSA)
treatment
To determine promoter methylation specific
gene silencing, we and others have previously reported
pharmacological unmasking strategies for numerous
genes in several cell lines of different cancer types [2729]. Here, to determine whether promoter methylation
is inversely correlated with expression of selected genes
(CCNA1 and CCND2) from our 8 gene panel, we treated
5 UCC cell lines with 5-aza-dc alone or in combination
with TSA (a histone deacetylase inhibitor). Out of the
4 genes associated with recurrence, we tested 2 genes
for reactivation after treatment with epigenetic agents.
Our findings as a proof of principle indeed showed
that CCND2 and CCNA1 can be re-expressed with the
treatment of epigenetic drugs. Other two genes that
showed association with recurrence were previously
reported to be re-expressed after treatment with epigenetic
drugs ([30, 31]).
Two UCC cell lines (SW780 and J82) showed reexpression of CCNA1 after 5-aza-dc treatment (p < 0.001)
and after combination treatment (p < 0.05 in J82 and p <
0.001 in SW780) (Figure 3A). CCND2 showed a similar
pattern of re-expression with 5-aza-dc treatment (UMUC3, J82 and T24) and after combination treatment (UMUC3, J82, T24 and SW780). CCND2 expression was downregulated only in the HT1376 cell line after treatment with
5-aza-dc and trichostatin-A (Figure 3B). To determine
whether promoter methylation of CCNA1 and CCND2
are inversely correlated with expression, we performed
QMSP assay for CCNA1 and CCND2. Among the 5 UCC

CCNA1 suppresses proliferation and colony
formation of UCC cells
To evaluate the effect of CCNA1 on the growth
of UCC cell lines, CCNA1 was forcefully expressed in
J82 cell line. Verification of CCNA1 overexpression was
done by Q-RT-PCR and immunoblotting analysis 48h
after transfection (data not shown). As shown in Figure
4A, forced expression of CCNA1 significantly inhibited
growth of J82 cells in culture (p=<0.0001), where cell
growth inhibition is mediated in a time-dependent manner.
To assess long-term growth, colony focus assays were
performed after treatment of CCNA1 transfected cells with
the plasmid selection marker G418 for 2 weeks. CCNA1
showed potent tumor suppressive activity by markedly
reducing the colony-forming ability of the cells as shown
in Figure 4B.

DISCUSSION
The main goal of this study was to evaluate wheter
the status of promoter methylation of a candidate gene or
gene-panel was different among LGPUCC that recurred
and those that did not. For further monitoring of patients
after TURBT of LGPUCC, a non-invasive screening
test is essential in order to avoid invasive and costly

3 gene panel (methylation in either: CCND2, CALCA, and/
or CCNA1), values comparable to the 2 gene panel showed
by Renard et al.’s study. It would be interesting to analyze
a cohort of urine samples from LGUCC cases for all the
5 genes (CCNA1, CCND2, CALCA, NID2 and TWIST1)
and determine the sensitivity and specificity of the test. A
prospective study using appropriate controls and number
of samples is necessary to determine the clinical utility of
these markers. Furthermore, subsequently collected urine
samples in follow-up visits need to be tested to determine
the marker’s usefulness in reducing cystoscopy in followup visits.
In our study, we considered any recurrence as
presence of recurrence. Due to the limited number of
primary LGPUCC samples we were not able to stratify
the cases based on length of follow-up time to recurrence.
Several studies previously used a minimum follow-up
period of 12 months after TURBT to evaluate potential
biomarkers at the time of diagnosis for the prediction of
recurrence. However, in our study, using 12 months as
the cutoff, we ended up with only 12 non-recurrent and
13 recurrent LGPUCC cases for analysis, which is not
enough for meaningful statistical analysis. Further studies
using larger cohort are necessary. We are now followingup our cohorts in order to better delineate the precise role
of a given marker in relation to recurrence.
The ultimate goal of this pilot study was to identify
markers that could be detected in urine samples from
LGPUCC patients obtained during follow-up visits
after TURBT in order to reduce the need of performing
cystoscopies. An optimal non-invasive molecular test
will allow for screening of patients before an invasive
procedure, which might also reduce the number of
cystoscopies necessary in surveillance of non–muscleinvasive bladder cancer. If the test has high sensitivity
and specificity, cystoscopy would only be performed in
patients who are positive for the non-invasive test. We
are in the process of longitudinally collecting followup urine samples in subsequent visits of LGPUCC
patients following cystoscopy and TURBT. Urine DNA
methylation testing of such samples needs to be performed
to evaluate the utility of such a test potentially substituting
for and therefore extending the currently adopted interim
follow-up scheme between cystoscopies.
Given the lack of an adequate number of
sequentially collected urine samples, in the current
cohort, we focused on determining the feasibility of the
detection of cancer specific methylation of three genes
by testing urine from UCC cases and controls. These 3
genes (CCND2, CCNA1 and CALCA) were selected from
our panel of 8 genes that were analyzed in non-recurrent
and recurrent primary LGPUCC. Our findings support that
the presence of cancer can be determined by testing the
promoter methylation of these genes with high specificity
in urine. To our best knowledge, these 3 genes had not
been tested previously in LGPUCC urine samples by our

procedures such as cystoscopy. To this end, we evaluated
the feasibility of a set of genes that predicts recurrence in
primary LGPUCC for the non-invasive detection of UCC
in urine sediments. To elucidate the biologic relationship
of CCNA1 silencing in the context of UCC, we performed
different in vitro assays and our data is consistent with
our findings in human primary LGPUCC that CCNA1 is a
potential tumor suppressor gene.
We analyzed promoter methylation of 8 genes
(ARF, TIMP3, RAR-β2, NID2, CCNA1, AIM1, CALCA
and CCND2) in the recurrent and non-recurrent LGPUCC
and observed that the methylation frequencies of 3 genes
(NID2, CCNA1, and CCND2) were significantly higher
in recurrent LGPUCC. The frequency of promoter
methylation of CALCA was borderline significant
(p=0.09). We had previously shown a UCC specific
methylation pattern for CCND2, CCNA1 and CALCA
[11]. In the latter study, we analyzed 93 UCC samples and
26 normal uro-epithelium samples and observed 57% of
methylation in CCNA1 in tumors while no methylation
was observed in controls, 57% in CCND2 in tumors
while 19% in normals, and 65% in CALCA with 15% in
normal uro-epithelium [11]. AIM1, a gene without a clear
functional data, showed a UCC specific pattern (over 70%
in UCC) in our previous study [11], however, although we
found high frequency of methylation in the tested primary
LGPUCC samples in this study [22/36(61%)], AIM1 was
not differentially methylated among recurrent and nonrecurrent LGPUCC. This could be due to small sample
size in that study or AIM1 inactivation may be related to
both initiation and progression of UCC. Ulazzi et al., [30]
were the first group to demonstrate NID2 methylation in a
cancer specific manner, in human gastrointestinal cancer;
promoter hypermethylation of NID2 was shown in 14 out
of 48 colon carcinoma samples analyzed compared to
0/24 normal colon, 19/20 of the gastric carcinomas, and
0/13 normal gastric mucosa. Moreover, Renard et al. [14]
performed a pharmacologic unmasking method in four
UCC cell lines, generated a list of candidate methylated
genes, and subsequently performed methylation-specific
PCR (MSP) in UCC and normal tissue samples. In their
study, NID2 showed methylation in 66 out of 91 UCC
tissues and 0 out of 39 normal urothelial tissues analyzed.
They then analyzed promoter methylation of NID2 and
TWIST1 as a panel in urine DNA from UCC patients and
controls. This two gene panel detected UCC patients with
90% sensitivity and 93% specificity while the sensitivity
and specificity of cytology test in the same cohort
were 48% and 96% respectively. When analyzing only
LGPUCC, they observed a sensitivity of 80% (training
set) and 89% (validation set) compared to 45% and
44% from cytology, with a sensitivity of 94% and 91%
compared to cytology’s sensitivity of 97% and 95%. In
our cohort, cytology data was available for 70 LGPUCC
cases, and the cytology sensitivity for LGPUCC was 50%,
while the methylation sensitivity was about 79% using our

group and others; and can be incorporated in a gene panel
for future early detection and monitoring of LGPUCC
patients. We analyzed 148 urine samples, and of the
125 with known grade, 101 of those urine samples were
collected from LGPUCC patients. 97 of 101 LGPUCC
cases were methylation positive for at least one of the 3
markers tested. Interestingly, our methylation assays were
able to detect 25 LGPUCC cases where urine cytology was
negative. The latter suggests that these markers may have
potential for non-invasive monitoring of LGPUCC after
TURBT. Due to the limited amount of bisulfite converted
DNA, we were not able to assess NID2 methylation in
urine DNA of UCC cases and controls. However, this gene
has previously shown excellent discrimination between
urine of UCC patients and controls, with a sensitivity of
94% and a specificity of 91% [14].
We tested the relevance of promoter methylation
compared to expression of two members (CCNA1 and
CCND2) of the cyclin family in this study and in general
methylation was correlated with expression in UCC cell
lines. CCNA1 is known to be a downstream target of TP53
[32], and CCNA1 methylation was shown to be inversely
related to p53 mutational status in primary Head and Neck
Squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Forced expression
of CCNA1 resulted in robust induction of wild-type p53 in
HNSCC cell lines [16]. CCNA1 is frequently inactivated
in UCC [11], which indicates its anti-proliferative
activity; however, in a recent study, it has been implicated
that CCNA1 contributes to prostate cancer invasion
and metastasis [33]. It may be speculated that CCNA1
may play different roles in different tumor types and in
different biological contexts. Our data in non-recurrent
and recurrent primary LGPUCC demonstrated that
CCNA1 is significantly more methylated (e.g. silenced) in
recurrent LGPUCC than in non-recurrent LGPUCC. We
speculate that inactivation of CCNA1 may have some role
in recurrence; although, we do not have definite functional
evidence. However, limited functional studies performed
in this study for CCNA1 are in the same direction as our
findings in primary LGPUCC, which is that it has growth
suppressive activity. Further studies need to be performed
to understand the mechanistic role of CCNA1 in the
pathogenesis and recurrence of LGPUCC.
Although our limited data suggests that CCND2 is
a potential tumor suppressor gene (TSG) in UCC, the role
of CCND2 in human cancer is controversial. It has been
proposed as a proto-oncogene, and its overexpression has
been reported in gastric cancer [21], ovarian and testicular
tumors [34], and hematopoietic cell cancer [35, 36]. In
contrast, reduction or lack of CCND2 expression has also
been reported in gastric cancer [20], breast cancer [37, 38],
prostate cancer [39], and lung cancer [18], suggesting that
CCND2 may function as a TSG. Recently, transcriptional
silencing by aberrant methylation of promoter region of
the CCND2 gene has been found in gastric cancer [20],
breast cancer [38, 40], prostate cancer [39, 41], lung
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancer [18], and Epstein–Barr virus-positive Burkitt’s
lymphoma [42]. These previous reports suggest that
CCND2 may function as an oncogene or a TSG, and
the critical biological role of this molecule needs to be
explored in the biological context of UCC pathogenesis.
A recent study [43] reported that reduced expression of
CCND2 in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
is associated with poor recurrence-free survival. In the
present study, we found that CCND2 is significantly more
methylated in recurrent than in non-recurrent LGPUCC,
which indicates a potential similar biological role for
CCND2 in NSCLC and LGPUCC, two types of cancers
related to smoking.
All of the remaining studied genes have been
previously described as hypermethylated in UCC:
CALCA (calcitonin-related polypeptide alpha is involved
in calcium regulation and acts to regulate phosphorus
metabolism) was not only shown to have a UCC specific
methylation pattern, but was also correlated to later stage
tumors (>pT2) [11]. ARF or p14, an important player
in cell cycle regulation, has been previously studied in
UCC, and the range of methylation frequency observed
was between 0 and 56% [44, 45]. Dominguez et al.
[45] showed that the presence of p14 methylation in
the plasma was significantly associated to recurrence in
UCC. In our cohort, we could not confirm this data in
tumor samples, which may be due to the limited sample
size. RAR-β2, involved in cell differentiation, has been
analyzed in UCC to give diverse results, from 2 to
almost 90% methylation [46, 47]. Promoter methylation
of TIMP3 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3) in
urine DNA was shown to be an independent prognostic
factor for UCC [13]; however, here, we did not observe a
correlation with recurrence in primary LGPUCC samples.
An extended study using a larger primary LGPUCC
cohort will elucidate the role of TIMP3 in recurrence of
LGPUCC.
Although our group and others have shown
evidence that some methylation markers have potential
for noninvasive UCC detection and for predicting patient
survival and tumor progression [12, 13, 47], there are still
no methylation based markers implemented in the clinical
practice. For the prediction of recurrence of LGPUCC,
Tada et al. [48] reported that hypermethylation of deathassociated protein kinase (DAPK1) might be a useful
prognostic marker for disease recurrence in superficial
UCC. In their study, a total of 88% of papillary UCC with
DAPK1 methylation recurred within 15 months, while
71% of tumors that were not methylated for DAPK1 had
not recurred within 24 months. Nevertheless, previous
studies have shown infrequent DAPK1 methylation in
UCC samples [49, 50].
In summary, this work not only sheds light onto
new potential methylation based markers associated
with recurrent LGPUCC, but also shows the potential
of detection of 3 novel genes in urine sediments and

DNA extraction

demonstrates initial evidence of tumor suppressive
activities of CCNA1 in the context of the biology of UCC
cell lines. A larger prospective study with longitudinal
follow-up with an independent cohort is needed to assess
and validate our preliminary promising findings.

All original LGPUCC histologic slides were
reviewed to reconfirm the diagnosis by a senior urologic
pathologist (GN). A representative formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) block that contained sufficient
amount of tissue was retrieved for DNA extraction and
several 10 micron slides were obtained from each block.
The presence of tumor cells was confirmed by staining
the first and last slides of the representative block
with hematoxylin & eosin. The tumor samples were
microdissected to obtain >70% of neoplastic cells. DNA
from tumors, cell lines and urine sediments were extracted
using the phenol-chloroform extraction protocol followed
by ethanol precipitation as described previously [51].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue and urine samples
A total of 36 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) primary LGPUCC tissues were obtained from
patients who underwent therapeutic surgery at The
Johns Hopkins Hospital. The demographic and clinical
information was obtained from the computerized tumor
registry at The Johns Hopkins Healthcare System. Among
the 36 LGPUCC samples, 17 were collected from patients
who did not recur during any follow-up periods, and the
remaining 19 were primary tumor samples that recurred
within the follow-up periods after TURBT. We also
performed analysis by considering the follow-up periods
of 12, 18, and 24 months for recurrence to observe the
association with promoter methylation of candidate
markers. To be included in the cohort, an eligible patient
had to have a confirmed diagnosis of LGPUCC and a
sufficient amount of archived tumor material for DNA
extraction. A detailed summary of all the LGPUCC
samples with their clinico-pathological parameters is
available in Table 1.
To determine the feasibility of detecting promoter
methylation of genes in urine related to LGPUCC
recurrence, we tested promoter methylation of 3 genes
(CCND2, CCNA1 and CALCA) in the urine sediment of
73 to 148 patients with primary UCC (101 LGPUCC, 24
high grade UCC and 23 unknown grade) and of 56 to 60
healthy subjects without any known neoplastic diseases.
Fifty milliliters of voided urine were collected from all
cases prior to definite surgery. Urine samples were spun
at 3000 × g for 10 min and washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline. All samples were stored at −80°C.
Approval for research on human subjects was
obtained from The Johns Hopkins University institutional
review boards. This study qualified for exemption under
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services policy
for protection of human subjects [45 CFR 46.101(b)].

Bisulfite Treatment
DNA extracted from primary tumors, cell lines and
urines was subjected to bisulfite treatment, which converts
unmethylated cytosine residues to uracil residues, as
described previously [52]. EpiTect Bisulfite kit (Cat No.
59104, from QIAGEN Inc. Valencia, CA – 91355) was
used for this conversion, following the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Quantitative fluorogenic methylation specific PCR
(QMSP)
Bisulfite-modified DNA was used as a template
for fluorescence-based real-time PCR, as previously
described [12]. Amplification reactions were carried out
in triplicate in a final volume of 20 μL that contained 2
μL of bisulfite-modified DNA; 600 nM concentrations
of forward and reverse primers; 200 nM probe; 0.6 U of
platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, Frederick, MD);
200 μM concentrations each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and
dTTP; and 6.7 mM MgCl2. Primers and probes were
designed to specifically amplify the promoter region of
ARF, TIMP3, RAR-β2, CCNA1, NID2, AIM1, CALCA,
CCND2, and of a reference gene, β-actin; primer and
probe sequences and annealing temperatures are provided
in Supplemental Table 2A. Amplifications were carried
out in 384-well plates in a 7900HT sequence detector
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the following
conditions: 95 °C for 3 minutes, followed by 50 cycles
at 95 °C for 15 seconds and 60 °C for 1 minute. Results
were analyzed by a sequence detector system (SDS 2.4;
Applied Biosystems). Each plate included patient DNA
samples, and positive and negative controls. Serial
dilutions (90–0.009ng) of in vitro methylated DNA were
used to construct a calibration curve for each plate. All
samples were within the assay’s range of sensitivity
and reproducibility based on amplification of internal

Cell lines
All of the cell lines (HT1736, T24, J82, UM-UC-3
and SW780) used in this study were cultured accordingly
to the recommendations of the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA, USA), from where
they were purchased.

reference standard (threshold cycle [CT] value for
β-actin of 40). The relative level of methylated DNA
for each gene in each sample was determined as a ratio
of methylation specific PCR-amplified gene to β-actin
(reference gene) and then multiplied by 1000 for easier
tabulation (average value of triplicates of gene of interest
divided by the average value of triplicates of β-actin
x 1000). The presence or absence of methylation was
compared between recurrent and non-recurrent groups
using cross-tabulations and χ2  or Fisher’s exact tests
as appropriate. The cutoff value for each gene was
established by maximizing sensitivity and specificity. We
determined the empiric cutoff on individual ROC (receiver
operating curves) that makes optimal differences between
the two groups (maximizing sensitivity and specificity).
In our previous study [12], we found that dichotomization
and logistic regression essentially produces similar results.
Furthermore, considering the small number of sample size,
we decided to use empiric cutoffs to see the differences
between the two groups.

in a final reaction volume of 10 µl. The RT-PCR primer
sequences are available in Supplementary Table 2B. The
cycling conditions were as follows: a denaturation step
at 95ºC for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95ºC for 15
s, 60ºC for 60 s, and a final step for the generation of a
dissociation curve to distinguish between the main RTPCR product and primer-dimers. Calculations were made
with the use of the comparative CT (2_ΔΔCT) method.
GAPDH was used as an internal control gene to normalize
the reaction for the amount of RNA added to the reverse
transcription reactions [53]. Each real-time PCR reaction
was performed in triplicates to evaluate the reproducibility
of data.

Cellular Viability Assay (MTT Assay)
Cellular proliferation was measured by the thiazolyl
blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma-Aldrich)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, J82
cells were counted and seeded at a density of 1000 cells
per well on 96 well plates, in triplicates. The cells were
allowed to attach overnight. One plate of cells was seeded
in the absence of serum to synchronize growth, while
another plate was seeded in the presence of serum (10%
FBS). Transfection with the pCMS-EGFP-cyclinA1 and
pCMS-EGFP-MOCK (control) vectors (kindly provided
by Dr. Jenny L. Persson, Clinical Research Center, Malmo,
Sweden) was performed using Fugene HD transfection
reagent (Roche). The cell doubling time was calculated
during exponential growth phase (0, 24, 48 and 72 hrs).
Ten microliters of MTT labeling reagent (5 mg/mL MTT)
were added to the culture media without fetal bovine
serum (FBS), which was then incubated in the dark for
additional 3h at 37ºC. This step was followed by cell lysis
with the addition of 100μL DMSO. Spectrophotometric
readings (A570 nm to A650 nm) were obtained on a Spectra
Max 250 96-well plate reader (Molecular Devices). Each
assay was carried out in triplicate and each experiment
was repeated at least two times.

5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dc) and Trichostatin A
(TSA) treatment
UCC cells were seeded in 75 cm2 culture ﬂasks
at a density of 2 x 105 and incubated at 37ºC in 5%
CO2/95% air overnight. Cells were then treated with 5μM
of 5-aza-dc (Sigma Chemical, Sigma, USA) for 5 days.
Medium with 5-aza-dc was changed daily. Additionally,
combination treatment with 5-aza-dc and TSA was
performed by adding 5μM of 5-aza-dc daily for 5 days
and TSA (300 nmol/L; Sigma) was added to the medium
for the final 24 hours. Cells were harvested after the last
day of treatment (5-aza-dc only and 5 aza-dc + TSA) for
RNA extraction and the analysis of gene expression were
performed by Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR
(Q-RT-PCR). PBS (phosphate buffered saline) alone was
used as a control to exclude non-speciﬁc solvent effects
on cells. All experiments were run independently twice.

Transfection and colony formation assay

RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and Quantitative
Reverse Transcription-PCR (Q-RT-PCR)

Colony formation assays were performed in
monolayer culture [54]. J82 cells were plated at a
density of 2 × 104 cells/well using 6-well plates, and
transfected with 1 μg of either the pCMS-EGFP-cyclinA1
or pCMS-EGFP-MOCK (control) vectors using Fugene
HD transfection reagent (Roche), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The cells were then detached
and plated on 100 mm tissue culture dishes at 24 to 48
hrs post-transfection and simultaneously harvested at 48 hr
after transfection to confirm the overexpression of CCNA1
at the mRNA level (Q-RT-PCR) and protein level. Cells
were cultured for 2 weeks in medium containing 400 µg/
mL of G418 (Cellgro, Manassas, VA). The cultures were

RNA was extracted using Qiazol Lysis reagent
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. One microgram of total RNA was used
for cDNA conversion using the Quantitect Reverse
Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), following
manufacturer’s protocol.
Q-RT-PCR was performed using the SYBR Green
chemistry in a 7900HT Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The reaction mixture
contained 2.6 µl of DEPC-treated water, 5 µl Power SYBR
Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 0.2 µl
of gene-specific primers (final concentration, 50 nM each),

washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
fixed with 25% acetic acid and 75% methanol at room
temperature for 10 minutes, and then stained with 0.1%
crystal violet. Colonies were counted and the number of
colonies per dish was averaged from three independent
experiments that were performed. This colony formation
assay was repeated three independent times.
