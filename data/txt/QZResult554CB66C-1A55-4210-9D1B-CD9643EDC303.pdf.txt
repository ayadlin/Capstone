ABSTRACT:
A small molecule compound, JTP-74057/GSK1120212/trametinib, had been
discovered as a very potent antiproliferative agent able to induce the accumulation
of CDK inhibitor p15INK4b. To conduct its drug development rationally as an anticancer
agent, molecular targets of this compound were identified as MEK1/2 using compoundaffinity chromatography. It was shown that JTP-74057 directly bound to MEK1
and MEK2 and allosterically inhibited their kinase activities, and that its inhibitory
characteristics were similar to those of the known and different chemotype of MEK
inhibitors PD0325901 and U0126. It was further shown that JTP-74057 induced rapid
and sustained dephosphorylation of phosphorylated MEK in HT-29 colon and other
cancer cell lines, while this decrease in phosphorylated MEK was not observed in
PD0325901-treated cancer cells. Physicochemical analyses revealed that JTP-74057
preferentially binds to unphosphorylated MEK (u-MEK) in unique characteristics of
both high affinity based on extremely low dissociation rates and ability stabilizing
u-MEK with high thermal shift, which were markedly different from PD0325901. These
findings indicate that JTP-74057 is a novel MEK inhibitor able to sustain MEK to be
an unphosphorylated form resulting in pronounced suppression of the downstream
signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation.

INTRODUCTION

existence of insensitive cancer types and the emergence
of resistant mechanisms against them [9-12].
MEK1 and MEK2 are kinases that link the cascade
between Raf and ERK, and their inactive unphosphorylated
forms (u-MEK1/2) become phosphorylated (p-MEK1/2)
and hence activated by Raf kinase. Since MEK plays
critical roles in tumor growth and progression, some
MEK inhibitors have been developed and evaluated as
potential therapeutic agents [13-16]. However, these
drugs did not show significant benefits for cancer patients,
and have drawbacks including adverse events caused

Cancer cells utilize surface receptors for growth
factors and signaling molecules of the Ras–Raf–MEK–
ERK pathway to promote cell growth, and this pathway
is critical of outgrowth even in Ras/Raf-unmutated cancer
cells [1-3]. Inhibitors of growth factor receptor EGFR and
Raf kinase suppress the activation of downstream kinases
(i.e., MEK and ERK) in this signaling pathway, thereby
offering significant benefits for many cancer patients [48]. At the same time, these inhibitors have clarified the

by off-target binding, limited potency, and an excessive
degree of chemical similarity that precludes mechanistic
differentiation [17-19]. To overcome these limitations,
it has been clear that new MEK inhibitors possessing
different chemical and pharmacological characteristics
are needed.
In general, cell phenotypic assays offer a feasible
method to identify novel drugs with good potency and
efficacy in vivo. JTP-74057 was originally discovered
as a CDK inhibitor p15INK4b-inducing agent in various
cancer cells, based on that p15INK4b possesses inhibitory
activity of cell cycle progression and usually retains as
an unmutated form even in cancer cells [20]. Screening
of our chemical library followed by extensive medicinal
chemistry enabled us to identify JTP-74057 as a promising
candidate compound. It has been revealed that JTP-74057
is a very potent antitumor agent in vitro and in vivo [21,
22]. Importantly, this compound exhibited over 50-fold
selectivity for cancer cells relative to normal tissues and
hematopoietic cells, suggesting that its molecular targets
and mechanism of action could heighten our understanding
of cancer cell growth and aid the development of novel
anticancer agents. Actually, JTP-74057/GSK1120212/
trametinib has recently been demonstrated to be a firstin-MEK inhibitor able to improve the progression-free
survival of BRAF-mutated advanced melanoma patients
with its ideal pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile
[23, 24].
We describe here that molecular targets of this
compound are MEK1 and 2, and that JTP-74057
possesses novel characteristics partly different from
previously known MEK inhibitors. Namely, drug-affinity
chromatography using chemical probes identified MEK1/2
as directly binding molecules, and JTP-74057 showed an
allosteric type of MEK inhibition similar with PD0325901.
Unlike PD0325901, however, it has been demonstrated
that JTP-74057 shifts the MEK phosphorylation status
from p-MEK toward u-MEK in several cancer cell lines
and binds to u-MEK with a very low dissociation rate.
In this paper, we further describe how this characteristic
of JTP-74057 is relevant to its very potent and prolonged
inhibition of Raf-MEK-ERK signaling in cancer cells.

revealed that attachment of conjugation linkers only to the
aniline nitrogen atom of this chemotype did not reduce
their antiproliferative effects on cancer cells. Since the
alkyl linker-conjugated compounds JTP-74100 (IC50: 2.1
nM in pentanoyl JTP-74100) and JTP-74099 (IC50: 840 nM
in pentanoyl JTP-74099) retained their antiproliferative
activities, both compounds were considered for use
as chemical probes with which to prepare compoundconjugated affinity resins and fluorescence-conjugated
compounds.
To identify specific binding targets, we prepared
three chemical affinity resins. The first was unconjugated
and used as a negative control, the second was conjugated
with JTP-74099 and the third was conjugated with the
more potent compound, JTP-74100 (Figure 1B). HT-29
cell lysates were incubated with the individual resins
and the bound proteins were extracted by pull-down
assays. Figure 2A shows the electrophoresis data of
these pull-down samples. Specific binding proteins,
including a dominant 46-kDa protein, accumulated in the
compound-conjugated resins, most significantly in the
resin conjugated with the potent JTP-74100, while the
unconjugated resin only bound proteins nonspecifically.
The bound proteins were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis
(Supplemental information), which revealed that MEK1
and MEK2 were the major proteins bound to JTP-74100,
with less extensive binding to JTP-74099 and negligible
binding to the negative control resin.
To confirm that the resin conjugated with JTP74100 specifically binds to MEK1/2, we performed
competitive analyses using active (JTP-70945) and
minimally active (JTP-65634) compounds of the same
chemotype, in addition to PD0325901 and U0126
as known MEK inhibitors originating from different
chemotypes [4, 25]. As shown in Figure 2B, JTP-70945
(at concentrations above 10 μM) clearly competed with
JTP-74100-immobilized resin for binding to MEK,
while the minimally active compound JTP-65634 did not
compete, even at a concentration of 100 μM. The other
chemotype MEK inhibitors, PD0325901 and U0126,
needed a concentration of 100 μM to clearly compete with
the binding of MEK to JTP-74100-immobilized resin.
Next, we determined whether JTP-74100 binds
to MEK in intact cells by detecting fluorescent signals
derived from TAMRA-conjugated JTP-74100 (Figure 1B)
in human MEK2-transfected HEK293T cells. As shown
in the lower panels of Fig. 2C, red fluorescent signals
corresponding to TAMRA-conjugated JTP-74100 were
distributed throughout the cytosol, but no signals were
detected in the nucleus. In contrast, we detected only
weak signals in mock-transfected cells. The distribution
of the fluorescent signals in the MEK-transfected cells
was consistent with the cytosolic localization of MEK
proteins, as reported previously [26]. Taken together, these
findings indicate that active compounds of the JTP-74057
chemotype directly bind to MEK proteins.

RESULTS
Identification of MEK1/2 as molecular targets of
JTP-74057.
A chemical affinity method was used to identify
a molecular target of JTP-74057 and other compounds
from the same chemotype. Linker-conjugated compounds
derived from the JTP-74057 chemotype were synthesized
and their growth-inhibitory effects were examined (Figure
1A and Supplemental information). The experiments

the sub-micromolar range, similar to that of PD0325901.
Second, the inhibitory activities of JTP-74057 on the
Raf–MEK–ERK kinase cascade were examined. This
experiment was based on active Raf (mutated B-Raf
(V600E) or truncated c-Raf), u-MEK1/2 and u-ERK2.
JTP-74057 and PD0325901 strongly inhibited the Raf–
MEK–ERK cascade with nanomolar potency, regardless
of the isotypes of Raf or MEK used, while PD0325901
showed similar inhibitory activity. Third, we examined
whether JTP-74057 inhibits the kinase activity of Raf
itself. The phosphorylation of the Raf kinase substrate

To address the effects of JTP-74057 on MEK
kinase activity, we examined its ability to inhibit various
enzymatic reactions of Raf, MEK and ERK, relative to that
of PD0325901. The results obtained from the three kinds
of kinase assays are summarized in Table 1, in addition to
their antiproliferative activities toward HT-29 cells.
First, we examined the MEK–ERK kinase reaction,
which was inhibited by JTP-74057 with an IC50 value in

MBP was not inhibited by JTP-74057 or PD0325901 at
concentrations below 10 μM. Under the same conditions,
the recognized Raf inhibitor BAY 43-9006 inhibited
Raf kinase activity at a concentration of 0.1 μM (data
not shown). These findings suggest that JTP-74057 is a
potent MEK inhibitor that acts via a similar mechanism to
that of PD0325901. We also determined that JTP-74057
was around 10-fold more potent at inhibiting cellular
proliferation than it was at suppressing the activity in the
Raf–MEK–ERK cascade assay (Table 1).
PD0325901 and U0126 are known to be ATPnoncompetitive allosteric MEK inhibitors [25, 27]. We
analyzed the kinetic properties of MEK inhibition by
JTP-74057 using active p-MEK1 and inactive u-ERK2
to establish double-reciprocal plots of MEK enzymatic
activity at the indicated concentrations of these
compounds with ATP. As shown in Figure 2D, these plots
revealed similar patterns for the three compounds, and
the lines did not cross the y-axis. The Ki and Ki’ values
represent the dissociation constants of the inhibitor from
p-MEK and the p-MEK–ATP complex, respectively. These
values indicated that JTP-74057 bound to p-MEK and the
p-MEK–ATP complex, and that the dissociation constants
of JTP-74057 were similar to or slightly weaker than those
of PD0325901. These findings indicate that JTP-74057 is
an ATP-noncompetitive allosteric MEK inhibitor, similar
to PD0325901 and U0126.

(Supplemental Figure 1). The inhibitory potency of JTP74057 on ERK phosphorylation and downstream signaling
was about 10-fold higher than that of PD0325901,
which was consistent with its growth inhibitory activity
toward HT-29 cells. These findings indicate that JTP74057 and PD0325901 suppress ERK phosphorylation
and hence affect the subsequent downstream signaling
cascade, thereby inhibiting to cell cycle progression. Of
particular interest is that JTP-74057, but not PD0325901,
shifted the MEK phosphorylation status from p-MEK
to u-MEK. In ACHN cells, since the p-MEK level was
low to detect clearly, the significant decrease of p-MEK
was not observed in JTP-74057 at the concentrations
showing inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. At higher
concentrations of PD0325901 but not JTP-74057, it was
clearly demonstrated that significant accumulation of
p-MEK was observed, which is often observed in cancer
cells treated by conventional MEK inhibitors [28, 29].
We further determined how JTP-74057 shifts
p-MEK to u-MEK in HT-29 cells. As shown in Figure 3B,
the time-course analyses revealed that the level of p-MEK
was decreased within 15 min and almost ablated at 30
min. To identify whether the disappearance of p-MEK
was reversible, the cells were exposed to JTP-74057
for a brief period (2 h), washed and cultured in normal
medium for the indicated times before measurement of the
MEK phosphorylation status. As shown in Figure 3C, the
disappearance of p-MEK was sustained for a considerable
period after removal of JTP-74057, and the p-MEK levels
gradually recovered during 24 h but were still lower than
the untreated level. The level of p-ERK was dependent on
p-MEK recovery, indicating that the modulation of p-MEK
by JTP-74057 had downstream effects on the activation of
ERK in HT-29 cells. In marked contrast, PD0325901 did
not affect the MEK phosphorylation status, and the p-ERK
level returned to nearly normal level within 1 h after its
removal from the culture media.
In order to assess whether this shift to u-MEK by
JTP-74057 is widely observed in various cancer cells, the

Alteration of MEK phosphorylation status by

Next, we analyzed the phosphoprylation status
of ERK and MEK to expect inhibition of downstream
signaling by JTP-74057. As shown in Figure 3A, JTP74057 and PD0325901 inhibited ERK phosphorylation,
while JTP-74057, but not PD0325901, decreased the
p-MEK level. It was also confirmed that inhibition of
ERK phosphorylation resulted in downstream signaling
to be inhibited and accumulation of p15INK4b and p27KIP1

specific mAbs. The data showed that ERK phosphorylation was efficiently inhibited in almost all cell lines, except for COLO-320DM, and
that the p-MEK levels decreased in HT-29, COLO-205, HCT-116, SW480 and SW620 cells, but did not decrease or decrease to a lesser
extent in HCT-15, LS-174T, T84 and LoVo cells.

phosphorylation status of MEK was examined in 10 cancer
cell lines. As shown in Figure 3D, JTP-74057 decreased
p-MEK abundance in approximately half of the cancer cell
lines examined, though the decreased levels of p-MEK
varied among individual cancer cell lines. These findings
indicate that the JTP-74057-induced shift of MEK from
p-MEK to u-MEK is not a universal phenomenon, but does
occur in a wide range of cancer cell lines. These findings
demonstrate a novel characteristic of JTP-74057, in that it
is able to induce a rapid and sustained shift from p-MEK
toward u-MEK. Moreover, the complex formed between
JTP-74057 and u-MEK is resistant to phosphorylation by
upstream kinases in cancer cells, thereby inhibiting ERK
phosphorylation effectively.

stabilized u-MEK and Tm value was shifted up to 57.5 oC.
Taken together, these findings indicate that JTP74057 tightly binds to u-MEK in the site not to be exactly
same with PD0325901, and that the mode of binding of
JTP-74057 to u-MEK is of a novel type.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have demonstrated that the small
molecule compound JTP-74057/GSK1120212/trametinib,
which was discovered using cell phenotypic assays, targets
MEK1/2 and binds to u-MEK with very high affinity
and stability. Upon binding to MEK, JTP-74057 inhibits
p-MEK activity as well as shifts the phosphorylation
status of MEK from p-MEK toward u-MEK, and renders
u-MEK resistant to phosphorylation. Moreover, JTP74057 possesses the novel characteristics that the shift
from p-MEK to u-MEK is rapidly induced and durably
sustained. We hypothesize that the characteristics of JTP74057 offer important molecular mechanisms for effective
inhibition of the Raf–MEK–ERK signaling pathway.
Figure 4D summarizes the proposed mechanism of
action in this group of MEK inhibitors. As this inhibitory
mechanism is unprecedented for MEK, JTP-74057
warrants consideration as a novel drug candidate targeting
MEK as a therapeutic strategy for cancer patients.
As shown in the physicochemical analyses (Figure
4A, B and C), JTP-74057 possesses unique characteristics
in terms of the preferential binding to, the very low
dissociation rate of, and the stabilizing ability of u-MEK,
which are different from those of PD0325901. These
results strongly suggest that JTP-74057 extends its
MEK-binding towards a novel binding site able to affect
phosphorylation of Ser217/221. This phosphorylation
site is thought not to be occupied by the scaffold
structure of PD0325901 chemotype compounds, since
PD0325901 did not increase u-MEK but accumulated
p-MEK (Figure 3). Actually, it has been reported that
one derivative compound of PD0325901 does not extend
to the site of Ser217/221 in crystal structure analysis of
MEK-compound complex [27]. Recently, inhibition of
Ser217/221 phosphorylation by GSK1120212/JTP-74057
in enzyme assay and cancer cells was studied by MS
analysis, and it has been shown that phosphorylation of
Ser217 site but not or less of Ser221 site is preferentially
inhibited by this compound [30] These previous findings
and results in this study highly suggest that JTP-74057,
but not PD0325901, interacts with Ser217 of u-MEK
and is able to fix its inactive structure resistant of
phosphorylation mediated by upper kinases such as Raf.
Actually, the docking model overlaying PD compound and
JTP-74057 in inactive form of MEK suggested that the
acetyl amino group of JTP-74057 extends to the region
of Ser217/221-containg activation loop (data not shown),
though a crystal structure analysis of the JTP-74057 and
u-MEK complex would be further worth to demonstrate

Unique binding mode of JTP-74057 to u-MEK.
To understand the mechanism of which JTP-74057
shifts p-MEK to u-MEK and prevents phosphorylation
of u-MEK in cancer cells, we conducted some
physicochemical analyses of MEK. As shown in Figure 4A
(left and center), FCS analyses using TAMRA-conjugated
JTP-74100 with the single molecule fluorescent analyzer
MF20 revealed that fluorescently labeled JTP-74100
had a high binding affinity for p-MEK1, comparable to
the results for JTP-74057 obtained in enzymatic analysis
(Figure 2D). And, this fluorescent compound bound
preferentially to u-MEK1, with a KD value that was 2-fold
lower than that for p-MEK. We also examined how JTP74057 and PD0325901 displace TAMRA-conjugated
JTP-74100 bound to 0.1 μM u-MEK. As shown in Figure
4A (right), the binding of TAMRA-conjugated JTP74100 to u-MEK was displaced by JTP-74057 in a dosedependent manner, whereas PD0325901 needed around
100-fold more concentration to replace it. These findings
indicate that JTP-74057 and PD0325901 have different
binding properties to u-MEK, and that the binding site
of JTP-74057 in u-MEK is not exactly same to that of
PD0325901.
Next, we examined the binding properties of both
compounds to u-MEK using SPR. u-MEK stabilized with
PD0325901 was immobilized on a sensor chip and used
to assess the binding of each compound after washout of
PD0325901. As shown in Figure 4B, JTP-74057 exhibited
an extremely low dissociation rate constant (koff=1.2×10-4
s-1) to that of PD0325901 (koff=1.1×10-1 s-1), resulting in a
very high affinity of JTP-74057 for u-MEK. The KD value
of JTP-74057 to u-MEK1 was 3.5×10-10 M, compared to
6.1×10-8 M for PD0325901. To further assess if JTP-74057
forms stable complex with inactive u-MEK, we examined
thermal stabilities of drug-MEK complexes using a
temperature-dependent CD spectropolarimeter. As shown
in Figure 4C, PD0325901 marginally stabilized u-MEK,
and the mid temperature of thermal unfolding (Tm) of
u-MEK was about 50 oC in the absence or presence of
PD0325901. In marked contrast, JTP-74057 significantly

(center) were incubated with 1.5 nM TAMRA-conjugated JTP-74100 for 30 min at 25°C. The FCS measurements were performed with
a single molecule fluorescence analyzer (MF20). The calculated KD values of TAMRA-conjugated JTP-74100 for p-MEK and u-MEK1
are 4.1×10-8 M and 2.1×10-8 M, respectively. In the right panel, u-MEK1 (0.1 μM) was incubated with 1.5 nM TAMRA-conjugated JTP74057 plus various concentrations of JTP-74057 or PD0325901 to displace the reporter probe. (B) SPR analysis. After immobilization of
u-MEK to CM5 sensor chips, JTP-74057 and PD0325901 were injected at the indicated concentrations. A 1:1 binding model with mass
transfer was fitted to the sensorgrams. Theoretical curves (black) were overlaid on the experimental traces. The KD (M) and koff (s-1) to
u-MEK are 3.5×10-10 and 1.2×10-4 for JTP-74057, and 6.1×10-8 and 1.1×10-1 for PD0325901, respectively. (C) Temperature-dependent CD
analysis. Ellipticities of inactive u-MEK were analyzed at the temperature between 30 to 80 oC in the absence or presence of 10μM of either
JTP-74057 or PD0325901. The Tm values were calculated by individual fitting curve to 50.2 oC for u-MEK alone, 50.9 oC for u-MEK
with PD0325901, and 57.5 oC for u-MEK with JTP-74057. (D) A scheme showing a novel type of allosteric MEK inhibitor JTP-74057/

phosphorylation, but also the phosphorylation of MEK by the upstream kinase Raf, resulting in a shift from p-MEK to u-MEK.

this unique binding in detail.
This unique binding to u-MEK could explain why
JTP-74057 effectively inhibits ERK phosphorylation
and prolongs the unphosphorylation state of MEK. In
order to understand the rapid shift of p-MEK to u-MEK
by this compound (Figure 3B), however, an unrevealed
feedback mechanism seems necessary to be considered,
instead of known feedback mechanisms [28, 29, 31,
32]. The hyperphosphorylation of Raf by active ERK
and the dephosphorylation of active ERK by dualspecific phosphatases such as DUSP6/MKP3 have been
reported as two of the negative feedback mechanisms
in this signaling pathway. While in the case of MEK it
has not been clarified whether a negative feedback loop
exists and plays a role in MEK inactivation, our data
indicate that p-MEK is rapidly converted to u-MEK in the
presence of JTP-74057. This may indicate that p-MEK
is actively dephosphorylated by one (or both) of two
possible mechanisms. The first is the existence of a MEKspecific phosphatase that constitutively dephosphorylates
p-MEK, and whose action is accentuated when JTP74057 inhibits MEK phosphorylation (i.e. the balance
in the MEK phosphorylation status shifts toward
dephosphorylation). The other is that p-MEK undergoes
a subtle conformational change following binding of
JTP-74057 that allows the known phosphatases to crossrecognize and dephosphorylate it rapidly. While p-ERK
phosphatase DUSP6 and PP2A did not involve in this
active conversion towards u-MEK (unpublished data),
further investigation of these possibilities could reveal a
novel feedback mechanism that controls activation and
inactivation of MEK.
Raf kinase activity is negatively regulated by active
ERK via hyperphosphorylation of Raf. Blockade of
MEK or ERK by inhibitors disinhibits Raf and leads to
p-MEK accumulation in this kinase cluster. Compounds of
previously developed chemotypes, including PD0325901
and AZ6244, frequently induce accumulation of p-MEK
in cancer cells and tissues, especially in B-Raf unmutated
tumors [28, 29]. It was actually shown that PD0325901
induced significant accumulation of p-MEK in ACHN
kidney cancer cells, which are derived from a K-Ras
mutated, but B-Raf unmutated, tumor (Figure 3A). In
contrast, JTP-74057 did not significantly, or slightly if any,
induce accumulation of p-MEK in this B-Raf unmutated
cancer cells. These findings suggest that JTP-74057, but
not PD0325901, can inhibit MEK phosphorylation even
when the kinase activity of Raf is disinhibited. In the case
of B-Raf (V600E) mutated tumors, it has been reported
that the kinase activity of Raf cannot be controlled by
feedback inhibition [31, 32]. Our data showed that JTP74057 efficiently reduced the p-MEK levels in cell lines
such as HT-29 and COLO-205 that carry the V600E
B-Raf mutation (Figure 3D). These findings indicate
that JTP-74057 can reverse the high level of p-MEK that
arises when mutated B-Raf circumvents the disabling
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

negative feedback. This could explain why the potency
of JTP-74057 in the cell phenotypic assays was higher
than that in the enzymatic assays (Table 1, Figure 3A and
Supplemental Figure). Taken together, in both Raf mutated
and unmutated tumors, MEK inhibitors possessing the
characteristics of the JTP-74057 chemotype are thought to
potently and effectively inhibit Raf–MEK–ERK signaling.
Sustained inhibition of ERK phosphorylation
via a shift to u-MEK was observed in HT-29 cells after
washout of JTP-74057 from cultured cells (Fig. 3C).
This prolonged shift to u-MEK is likely to arise from
both the extremely low dissociation rate constant of
JTP-74057 (koff=1.2×10–4 s-1) once bound to u-MEK
and the stabilizing ability of JTP-74057 in inactive
u-MEK-compound complex (Figure 4B and C). These
also imply that JTP-74057 accumulates in the large
u-MEK population and inhibits ERK phosphorylation
via the prevention of MEK activation/phosphorylation by
upstream kinases in cancer cells and tissues. In fact, it was
shown that in vivo, JTP-74057/GSK1120212 had a long
half-life in the blood and inhibited ERK phosphorylation
in grafted cancer tissues after oral administration in
animals [22, 30]. These findings and the present results
suggest that the binding and accumulation of JTP-74057
on u-MEK leads to the sustained effects seen in vitro
and in vivo. Indeed, a phase I study of GSK1120212 in
cancer patients has recently shown that the t1/2 of orally
administered trametinib is about 4 days [24]. It is likely
that this ideal pharmacokinetic profile for MEK inhibition
in humans is at least partly caused by the characteristics
of this compound that are manifested in vitro as prolonged
bioactivity on u-MEK.

METHODS
Cell lines, reagents and chemical probes
HT-29 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line),
ACHN (human kidney cancer cell line), HEK293T (human
embryonic kidney cell line) and other types of cancer
cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA).
B-Raf (V600E), active Raf-1 (truncated), active MEK1,
inactive MEK1, active MEK2, inactive MEK2, inactive
MAPK2/ERK2 and bovine MBP were purchased from
Upstate Technology (Waltham, MA). Other inactive MEK
(K97R) was purchased from BPS Biosciences (San Diego,
CA). Antibodies specific to p-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221),
p-p44/42MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), MEK1/2 and ERK1/2
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly,
MA). The antibodies specific to p-MEK1/2 recognize
Ser217-phosphorylated MEK regardless of the state
of Ser221-phosphorylation. JTP-74057 chemotype
compounds and PD0325901 were synthesized according
to our previous report [21]. U0126 was purchased

Enzymatic kinase assays

from Cell Signaling Technology. For chemical affinity
chromatography and fluorescence imaging, JTP-74100
or JTP-74099 as a chemical probe was conjugated with
activated CH Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences,
Piscataway, NJ) resins and with the succinimidyl
hexanoate-linker TAMRA (5,6-linker mixture; Pierce,
Rockford, IL) in bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0) or phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4). The conjugation reactions with chemical
probes were monitored by HPLC, and the completion of
each reaction was determined by the diminishment of the
input chemical probe compounds.

MEK–ERK kinase assays were carried out in 20
mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 5
mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM Na3Vo4, 15 mM MgCl2,
10 μM ATP, 1 μCi [32P]ATP, 10 nM p-MEK (p-MEK1 or
p-MEK-2) and 300 nM u-ERK2. The Raf–MEK–ERK
kinase assays were carried out in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.5), 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.03% (v/v) Brij35, 0.1% (v/v)
2-mercaptoethanol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 μM ATP, 0.4 μCi
[32P]ATP, 0.6 nM active Raf (B-Raf or c-Raf), 10 nM
u-MEK (u-MEK1 or u-MEK 2) and 300 nM u-ERK2
[26]. After incubation of the components (except ATP) for
15 min at 30°C, the assays were initiated by adding ATP.
After 20 min, the samples were denatured with Laemmli
SDS sample buffer and subjected to PAGE, and the
radioactivity was analyzed using a phosphorimager (BAS
2000; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The purity of u-MEK was
measured by western blotting using antibodies specific to
p-MEK, and it was confirmed that there was no detectable
p-MEK in 500 pg of total u-MEK (data not shown).
Raf–MBP kinase assays were carried out in an identical
manner, except that the concentrations of B-Raf and c-Raf
were increased by 100- and 10-fold respectively. For
kinetic analyses of MEK inhibition, double-reciprocal
plot analyses were conducted in the presence of various
concentrations of the compounds. The Ki (MEK vs.
compound) and Ki’ (MEK/ATP vs. compound) values
were determined from the plots as previously described
[33].

Cell culture and preparation of cell lysates
HT-29 cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5a medium
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and
antibiotics. ACHN and HEK293T cells were maintained
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and antibiotics in a
humidified CO2 incubator. The growth inhibitory activities
of compounds toward HT-29 cells were determined by
[3H]-TdR incorporation for the last 6 h of a 3-day culture
period. To prepare the cytosolic fraction of HT-29 cells for
affinity chromatography, the cells were cultured, washed
with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in four volumes of
a hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT) for 20 min. The lysed
cells were then homogenized by 20 strokes of a loosefitting Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged for 6 min
at 4,300×g to separate the nuclei from the cytoplasmic
fraction. The cytoplasmic fraction was ultracentrifuged
for 1 h at 150,000×g and the supernatant was dialyzed
against a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 20%
(v/v) glycerol, 0.1 M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF
and 0.5 mM DTT for 5 h at 4°C. After centrifugation for
20 min at 15,000×g, the supernatant was collected as the
cytosolic fraction.

Western blot analysis
Cultured cells were treated with various compounds
and then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na3Vo4, 1% Triton
X-100 and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail). The
cell lysates were collected and centrifuged, and the
supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE. After the
electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto PVDF
membranes at 1 mA/cm2 for 1 h. The membranes were
incubated in blocking solution (Blockace; Nacalai Tesque,
Kyoto, Japan) and washed with PBS containing 0.1%
Tween 20 (PBS/T). The membranes were then incubated
with the primary antibody, washed three times with
PBS/T and incubated with the secondary antibody. After
washing with PBS/T, the membranes were incubated with
ECL-Plus or ECL-Advanced western blot reagents (GE
Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) for 5
min, exposed to ECL Hyperfilm and visualized using a
LAS3000 imager (Fujifilm).

Chemical probe-affinity chromatography
Activated CH Sepharose 4B resin was coupled with
the chemical probes in coupling buffer (10% ethanol, 0.1
mM Na2CO3 pH 8.0) on an end-to-end rotator at room
temperature for 1 h, and then blocked with 0.1 M TrisHCl (pH 8.0) at room temperature for 1 h. The resulting
resins were mixed with the HT-29 cytosolic fraction and
incubated at 4°C for 1 h. The bound proteins were eluted
with SDS sample buffer, heated at 95°C for 5 min and
separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were developed by
silver staining. For competition analyses using compounds
from the same chemotype and known MEK inhibitors,
HT-29 cytosolic fractions were incubated with or without
the various compounds on ice for 30 min, followed by the
pull-down assay described above.

and 1% DMSO. Compounds were diluted directly into the
running buffer. A typical analysis cycle consisted of a 60-s
sample injection (90 µl/min, association phase) followed
by buffer flow for 180 s (dissociation phase). Analyses of
the resulting sensorgrams were performed using Biacore
S51 Evaluation software (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Kinetic parameters were obtained by global fitting for
PD0325901 or local fitting for JTP-74057 to a 1:1 binding
model with mass transfer.

The pcDNA3.1(+) (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) or
pCMV6/human MEK2 (OriGene Technologies, Rockville,
MD) vectors were transfected into HEK293T cells using
GeneJammer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The transfected
cells were plated in 6-well culture plates at 3×105 cells/
well and treated with DMSO or 1 μM TAMRA-conjugated
JTP-74100 overnight. After replacing the medium with
normal medium to remove excess fluorescent probe,
the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS
supplemented with 10 µM Höechst 33258 at room
temperature for 20 min and visualized using an A1
fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

Temperature-dependent circular dichroism (CD)
The CD experiments were performed Jasco J720
spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan) with a piezoelectric
temperature controller, according to the previous report
[35] with slight modification. In brief, ellipticity was
monitored at 229 nm as a function of temperature with 1
mm path length cell, and the scan rate was 1 oC per min.
Inactive u-MEK (K97R) protein was diluted to 3 µM with
25 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1
mM DDT, and 0.1% DMSO. JTP-74057 and PD0325901
were tested at 10 µM concentrations. The representative
temperature-dependent ellipticity profiles were depicted,
and the midpoints of the protein unfolding transition
(Tm) were calculated as the average from two separate
experiments, according to the calculation equation
described in the previous report [36].

Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS)
FCS analysis was performed with a single molecule
fluorescence analyzer (MF20; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Several concentrations of p-MEK1 and u-MEK1 were
incubated with 1.5 nM of TAMRA-conjugated JTP-74100
for 30 min at 25°C in binding buffer (20 mM Hepes pH
7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The samples were
added to a 384-well glass-bottomed microplate, and FCS
measurements were performed in a sample volume of
30 μl with excitation at 543 nm (He/Ne laser) to detect
TAMRA-derived red fluorescence. All experiments
were performed under identical conditions with a data
acquisition time of 5 s per measurement. Measurements
were repeated five times per sample. The equilibrium
dissociation constant (KD) value was calculated by
Origin™ software (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton,
MA) according to a previously described method [34].

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
SPR measurements were performed using a Biacore
S51 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ). For
stabilization, u-MEK1 was diluted to 25 μg/ml in 10
mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0), 1% DMSO and 100 µM
PD0325901 shortly before immobilization. The stabilized
enzyme was then immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip
by amide coupling chemistry at 25°C using HBS-P+
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences) as a running buffer. The
surface of the sensor chip was activated with a mixture
of 0.1 M N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.4 M N-ethylN’-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide for 10 min.
Subsequently, u-MEK1 was injected for 7 min. Any
remaining activated ester groups were blocked with 1 M
ethanolamine (pH 8.5) for 10 min. The immobilization
levels typically ranged from 6,600–10,000 resonance
units. Interaction studies were conducted at 25°C in a
running buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150
mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.005% Tween 20
