Abstract
Inhibitors of the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor have been widely studied for their ability to
enhance the killing of a variety of malignant cells, but whether IGF-I signaling differentially protects the host
and cancer cells against chemotherapy is unknown. Starvation can protect mice, but not cancer cells, against
high-dose chemotherapy [differential stress resistance (DSR)]. Here, we offer evidence that IGF-I reduction
mediates part of the starvation-dependent DSR. A 72-hour fast in mice reduced circulating IGF-I by 70% and
increased the level of the IGF-I inhibitor IGFBP-1 by 11-fold. LID mice, with a 70% to 80% reduction in circulating
IGF-I levels, were protected against three of four chemotherapy drugs tested. Restoration of IGF-I was sufficient
to reverse the protective effect of fasting. Sixty percent of melanoma-bearing LID mice treated with doxorubicin
achieved long-term survival whereas all control mice died of either metastases or chemotherapy toxicity. Reducing IGF-I/IGF-I signaling protected primary glia, but not glioma cells, against cyclophosphamide and protected
mouse embryonic fibroblasts against doxorubicin. Further, S. cerevisiae lacking homologs of IGF-I signaling proteins were protected against chemotherapy-dependent DNA damage in a manner that could be reversed by expressing a constitutively active form of Ras. We conclude that normal cells and mice can be protected against
chemotherapy-dependent damage by reducing circulating IGF-I levels and by a mechanism that involves downregulation of proto-oncogene signals. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1564–72. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Most chemotherapy agents cause considerable damage to
normal cells, leading to toxicity, which is dose limiting, and
causes both short- and long-term side effects in patients. Although drug development has reduced these side effects with
a succession of selective antitumor agents, such as antibodies that target specific antigens in cancer or agents with a
wider therapeutic index, toxicity continues to limit cancer
treatment. Thus, interventions that reduce the undesired
toxic side effects could increase the efficacy of many chemotherapy drugs. Chemoprotectants such as amifostine, glutathione, mesna, and dexrazoxane have been investigated and
shown to provide drug-dependent protection to specific tis-

sues, but the use of these compounds has not been shown to
increase disease-free or overall survival (1). Recently, we reported that short-term starvation (STS) protects normal but
not, or much less, malignant cells, leading to improved survival [differential stress resistance (DSR); ref. 2]. Here we
present evidence that reduced insulin-like growth factor I
(IGF-I) is a major mediator of STS-dependent differential
protection.
Biogerontologists have long known that calorie restriction
(CR) and/or deficiencies in the pro-growth growth hormone
(GH)/IGF-I axis increase stress resistance and life span in
various model organisms (3). These beneficial effects can
be explained, in part, by the active diversion of energy utilization in starved or IGF-I–deficient organisms. The finite
energy source of an organism is finely balanced between
growth and maintenance under normal conditions (4). However, under challenging conditions such as starvation, the
energy is diverted from growth to maintenance, thereby enhancing protection and survival at the price of growth (5).
During starvation, several changes in the GH/IGF-I axis
occur as a result of physiologic adaptation to the new environment. Generally, GH directly regulates the production of
IGF-I, which is the major mediator of the growth effects of
GH (6). In humans, IGF-I levels decrease dramatically in response to short-term starvation (36–120 hours) despite increased GH secretion (7, 8). Long-lived organisms that are
deficient in IGF-I signaling have been shown to be resistant

Selectively Protecting Normal Cells by Reducing IGF-I

to multiple types of stress (9, 10). However, unlike normal
cells, cancer cells are self-sufficient in growth signals and insensitive to growth inhibitory signals (11). Self-sufficiency in
growth signals is often enabled by gain-of-function mutations
in oncogenes [e.g., IGF-I receptor (IGF-1R) or its downstream
effectors Ras, PI3K, etc.] that result in constitutive activation
of proliferation pathways independently or partially independently of external growth factor level. Notably, in normal cells,
the RAS/RAF/MAPK and the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathways can
be downregulated by CR or starvation (12), possibly by reducing IGF-I. On the other hand, insensitivity to growth inhibitory
signals is due to loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor genes (e.g., Rb, p53, PTEN, etc.), enabling cancer cells to
disregard antiproliferation signals (11, 13). Here we test the
hypothesis that the reduction of circulating IGF-I and its signaling mediates the protection of normal cells and mice
against chemotherapy toxicity, but not of oncogene-bearing
cancer cells, which do not respond to reduced IGF-I.

Materials and Methods
Stress resistance against chemotherapy treatments in
LID mice. LID mice, 75 to 100 wk of age, were used to model
human cancer treatment. Because liver is the major source of
IGF-I production, mice with a conditional hepatic Igf1 gene
knockout have 80% reduced circulating IGF-I levels (14). Because albumin is expressed in the liver after 10 d of birth,
resulting in liver Igf1 gene deletion, LID mice do not experience early death, growth retardation, or developmental defects like the Igf1 gene knockout (Igf1 −/−) mice (15). LID

and its control mice were given 100 mg/kg etoposide i.v. Cyclophosphamide was given at 500 mg/kg. Cyclophosphamide
was dissolved in saline at 40 mg/mL and injected i.p. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU; Sigma) was injected at 400 mg/kg i.p. Doxorubicin (DXR; Bedford Laboratories) was prepared at 5 mg/mL
in saline and injected i.v. first at 20 mg/kg and 22 d later at
28 mg/kg. All drugs have been selected from different categories. All mice were monitored daily for weight loss and signs of
pain and stress. Mice determined to be terminally moribund
were euthanized by CO2 narcosis and necropsy was done.
Experiments were done in accordance with the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (University of Southern
California, Los Angeles, CA) and NIH guidelines.
DSR against DXR in LID mice. To study DSR, mice were
injected with highly metastatic melanoma cells. LID and its
control mice of ages 75 to 100 wk were used. B16Fluc melanoma cells were a generous gift of Dr. Noah Craft at UCLA.
B16Fluc cells are derivatives of B16 cells but produce light by
stable transfection of the firefly luciferase gene driven by the
cytomegalovirus promoter (16). Before injection, cells were
washed and resuspended in sterile saline. Each mouse received 2 × 105 cells in 100 μL of saline, followed by another
100 μL of sterile saline to wash off remaining cells in the tails.
Three days after tumor inoculation, the first DXR (Bedford
Laboratories) injections were given at 16 mg/kg. Two weeks
after the initial DXR administration, the second DXR injection was given at 12 mg/kg. Mice were observed daily for
signs of stress or pain and body weight was recorded. Mice
determined to be terminally moribund were sacrificed by
CO2 narcosis and necropsy was done. The heart was collected
for further histologic examination.

Results
Short-term starvation regulates components of the progrowth GH/IGF-I axis. To investigate the role of the GH/
IGF-I axis in the beneficial effects of STS on DSR, we measured the levels of circulating GH and IGF-I and its binding
proteins, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3, in mice undergoing STS.
CD-1 mice were fasted for 72 hours and blood was collected
to measure glucose levels and plasma GH, IGF-I, IGFBP-1,
and IGFBP-3 levels. After a 72-hour STS, mice had lost approximately 20% of body weight, glucose levels were reduced
by 41%, GH levels were slightly increased, and IGF-I levels
decreased by 70% (Fig. 1A and B; Supplementary Fig. S1A
and B). The bioavailability of IGF-I, which can activate
IGF-1Rs, is regulated by IGF binding proteins. In fasted mice,
the level of IGFBP-1, which normally reduces IGF-I signaling,
increased 11.4-fold (Fig. 1C). These results are in agreement
with the reports showing that IGFBP-1 increases in response
to fasting in humans and rats (17–19) and also that its overexpression in mice effectively retards growth by sequestering
IGF-I (20). Furthermore, the 72-hour fast decreased IGFBP-3
levels by 42% (Fig. 1D), in agreement with reports on short-

term fasted humans and rats (19, 21). However, the mechanistic explanation for the decrease in IGFBP-3 is not clear.
To test if restoring the level of IGF-I during STS reverses
the protection against chemotherapy toxicity, CD-1 mice underwent a 48-hour STS with IGF-I (200 μg/kg) administration
every 12 hours. The level of injected IGF-I was determined
from prior serum IGF-I measurements of ad libitum fed mice.
Following the STS/IGF-I treatments, mice were i.v. injected
with 16 mg/kg DXR, a widely used chemotherapy drug acting
as an intercalating agent and topoisomerase II inhibitor (22).
Indeed, the restoration of IGF-I during STS abolished the
protective effect of STS on DXR toxicity, resulting in a
100% versus 38% survival in the STS and STS/IGF-I groups,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Previously, we showed that primary glia, but not glioma
cell lines, preincubated with low glucose (50 mg/dl compared
with the normal 100 mg/dl) and low serum (1% fetal bovine
serum with the consequent reduction of several growth factors including IGF-I) showed enhanced protection against
the alkylating chemotherapy agent cyclophosphamide (2).
The glucose levels of fasted mice were reduced to a similar
level, along with a dramatic decrease in IGF-I levels (Fig. 1A

Selectively Protecting Normal Cells by Reducing IGF-I

and B). Therefore, the reduction of IGF-I, a potent growth
factor, mediates part of the effect of fasting on DSR.
Reduced IGF-I signaling protects primary glia, but not
glioma cells, against high-dose cyclophosphamide. IGF-Ilike signaling pathways are implicated in regulating life span
and stress resistance in organisms ranging from the simple
yeast to worms, flies, and mice (3, 23–25). To test the role of
IGF-I signaling in DSR against chemotherapeutic drugs
in vitro, we incubated normal and the equivalent cancer cell
lines with an IGF-I receptor (IGF-1R) blocking antibody, low
serum concentrations, or excess IGF-I before treatment with
cyclophosphamide, a commonly used chemotherapy drug
based on its DNA alkylating properties (26). Primary mixed
rat glia (astrocytes + 5–10% microglia) and three different
rat glioma cell lines (C6, A10-85, and 9L) were tested. All cells
were grown to confluence to minimize differences in proliferation rate. Preincubation with an antagonistic IGF-1R antibody (αIR3) protected primary glia, but not the three glioma
cell lines, against cyclophosphamide toxicity (Fig. 2A). Reduction of serum level from the standard 10% to 1%, with consequent reduction of growth factors including IGF-I, decreased
the toxicity of 15 mg/mL cyclophosphamide to primary glia
but not to C6 glioma cells (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, preincubation with 100 ng/mL IGF-I (in the low reference range for
adult human serum; ref. 27) caused a 3-fold increase in the
toxicity of cyclophosphamide to primary mixed glia but did
not increase the toxicity of cyclophosphamide to C6 glioma
cells (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained with primary neurons and neuron-like pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) treated
with a combination of IGF-I and the oxidative stress agent
paraquat (Fig. 2D). These results are consistent with our previous studies on fasting and DSR (2) and support the hypothesis that downregulation of IGF-I signaling can protect
normal, but not cancer, cells against cytotoxic agents.
Effect of IGF-1R deletion or overexpression on stress resistance in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. To begin to
investigate the mechanism responsible for DSR, we treated
mouse embryonic fibroblasts bearing an Igf1r deletion (R−
cells) or overexpressing IGF-1R (R+ cells) with DXR (28). All
cells were grown to confluence to minimize the difference in
proliferation rate and were treated with DXR for 24 or 48
hours. After a 24-hour DXR treatment, R− cells showed greater
survival compared with R+ cells. The effect was most pronounced at 25 μmol/L where more than 80% of R− cells were
viable, whereas only 30% of R+ cells were alive (Fig. 3A; P <
0.0005). Similar results were observed when cells were treated
for 48 hours, with a 50% versus 12% survival rate for R− and R+
cells, respectively, at 25 μmol/L (Fig. 3B; P < 0.02).
To further investigate how deficiency in IGF-I signaling
protects against chemotoxicity, we measured DNA damage
using the comet assay. DXR-induced DNA damage was significantly higher in R+ cells compared with R− cells, with a
more than 3-fold difference as assessed by the comet assay
(Fig. 3C and D; P < 0.001). These results support our hypothesis that reduced IGF-I signaling protects normal cells by reducing chemotherapy-dependent DNA damage (29). Notably,
R− cells have been shown to be resistant against transformation by the SV40 large T-antigen, which is remarkable con-

yeast is based on the role of Ras2 and Sch9, homologs of the
mammalian Ras and S6K, respectively, in modulating
cellular defense against oxidative stress, DNA alkylation,
and thermal stress, which was demonstrated in our previous
studies (2, 31, 32), and on the central signaling role of homologs of SCH9 and RAS2 downstream of IGF-1R (Supplementary Fig. S3A). We tested the effect of the deletion of RAS2
and SCH9 on the resistance against DXR. To further investigate DSR, we also studied cells transformed with a gene expressing a constitutively active RAS2 (RAS2Val19) that models
human oncogenic Ras mutations. The deletion of SCH9
(sch9Δ) or both SCH9 and RAS2 (sch9Δ ras2Δ) provided
remarkable protection against DXR compared with its wildtype (WT) strains (Supplementary Fig. S3B). However, analogous to what we observed in mammalian cells, the expression
of the oncogene-like RAS2Val19 reversed the protection provided by RAS2 and SCH9 deficiency. After 48 hours of DXR
treatment, 50% of WT and RAS2val19-expressing cells survived, whereas 70% of sch9Δ and more than 90% of sch9Δ
ras2Δ survived (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The protection
was more pronounced after 72 hours of DXR treatment,
where sch9Δ ras2Δ and sch9Δ were highly protected (88%
and 70% survival, respectively), but the protection was reversed by the expression of RAS2val19 (sch9Δ RAS2val19; 27%
survival). To study the molecular mechanisms of differential
resistance to DXR, we monitored DNA mutation frequency,
measured as mutations in the CAN1 gene (Canr colonies/
106 cells; ref. 33). DXR treatments increased mutation frequency in all strains. In agreement with the survival analysis,
sch9Δ and sch9Δ ras2Δ exhibited the lowest mutation fre-

1568

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

quency, whereas RAS2val19 expression increased mutation frequency (Supplementary Fig. S3C). The expression of RAS2val19
in sch9Δ (sch9Δ RAS2val19) completely reversed the protection provided by the Sch9 deficiency, resulting in a 3-fold increase in mutation frequency (Supplementary Fig. S3B and
C). These data suggest that lowered Ras2 and Sch9 signaling
has a beneficial effect that could be, at least in part, due to
the enhanced protection against DNA damage in the cell,
which can be reversed by the expression of oncogenes.
Octreotide sensitizes NXS2 neuroblastoma cells but does
not protect mice against high-dose etoposide. Because reduction of IGF-I provided differential chemotherapy protection in mammalian cell culture, we tested if pharmacologic
manipulation of the GH/IGF-I axis could induce DSR in
vivo. The somatostatin analogue octreotide is used in
clinics to reduce GH secretion and IGF-I production primarily in acromegaly patients. In addition, octreotide was
selected because somatostatin increases in response to fasting (34). Interestingly, octreotide and other somatostatin
analogues have been shown to have therapeutic effects in
a number of cancers (35) through two distinct effects: direct actions on tumors mediated by somatostatin receptors
(36, 37) and indirect effects through inhibition of GH release and the lowering of IGF-I (36–38). In a previous report, we showed that STS provides DSR against high-dose
etoposide (2), a widely used chemotherapy drug that inhibits
topoisomerase II (39). Here, we tested if inhibiting the GH/
IGF-I axis with octreotide could increase the protection
against etoposide. We selected a particularly aggressive tumor line (NXS2) that models neuroblastoma (40). I.v. injection

Selectively Protecting Normal Cells by Reducing IGF-I

of NXS2 cells results in a consistent formation of metastasis
in multiple organs including the liver, kidneys, adrenal
gland, and ovaries (40). A single injection of high-dose etoposide (80 mg/kg) extended the life span of tumor-bearing
mice, which otherwise would have succumbed to metastasis within 40 days. In our previous study, STS caused a remarkable reduction in acute chemotoxicity–related deaths,
but it also provided partial protection to the cancer cells
(2). Our present results indicate that octreotide is not sufficient to protect the animals against chemotherapy, but its
combination with STS sensitizes the NXS2 cancer cells to
etoposide (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B; Supplementary
Fig. S4C, gr. 4 versus gr. 7; P < 0.01). However, octreotide
had a minimal effect on lowering IGF-I levels in mice (Supplementary Fig. S4D), which could explain its inability to

protect the animal. It is possible that homeostatic mechanisms counteract the effect of somatostatin and lead to tachyphylaxis to octreotide treatment, thus failing to reduce
IGF-I levels significantly.
To test if octreotide exerted its sensitizing effect on NXS2
cells directly or indirectly, we treated NXS2 cells with octreotide and etoposide in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S4E). Octreotide did not alter the toxicity of etoposide to NXS2 cells in
cell culture, suggesting that the sensitizing effect of octreotide in mice is indirect. Together, this implies that octreotide
alone does not provide starvation-like host protection, but it
may reverse the partial protection provided by STS to cancer
cells by sensitizing them. Further studies are necessary to investigate the possibility that octreotide may sensitize other
tumors against chemotherapy.

Enhanced stress resistance in LID mice against highdose chemotherapy. Mice with genetic disruptions in the
IGF-1R or its downstream effectors are more resistant to oxidative stress (9, 41). To determine whether reducing IGF-I
signaling protects from chemotoxicity, we tested a transgenic
mouse model with a conditional liver Igf1 gene deletion (LID;
ref. 15) resulting in a 70% to 80% postnatal reduction of
circulating IGF-I (14), which is similar to that of a 72-hour
fasted mouse (Fig. 1B). The LID mice provide a model for
investigating the mechanistic relationship between IGF-I
and fasting in chemotherapy resistance (42). A single administration of high-dose etoposide led to a 50% versus 88% survival rate, respectively, in the LID and control mice (Fig. 4A;
Supplementary Fig. S5A). Based on our in vitro results, we tested cyclophosphamide in LID mice. LID mice treated with
500 mg/kg cyclophosphamide showed significantly higher resistance, with a 70% versus 30% survival rate for LID and control mice, respectively (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, whereas LID
mice only lost an average of 10% of their weight, control mice
lost 20% (Supplementary Fig. S5B). The surviving LID mice also did not show signs of toxicity (Supplementary Fig. S6). To
determine the range of protection by reduced IGF-I, we tested
two additional drugs, 5-FU and DXR, which represent different
classes of chemotherapy drugs. 5-FU is an antimetabolite (43).
Survival after a treatment with high-dose 5-FU was improved,
with a 55% versus 10% survival rate in LID and controls, respectively, although the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 4C). Similar but more pronounced effects were
observed with DXR. Unlike etoposide and other drugs that
can cause irreversible damage to the tail vein of rodents after
a single high-dose injection, DXR can be injected for up to two
to three cycles (data not shown). To test the effect of multiple
cycles of chemotherapy, we challenged LID mice with two cycles of high-dose DXR. The first DXR injection (20 mg/kg) did
not result in any toxicity-related deaths, but led to considerable weight loss in all mice (Fig. 4D; Supplementary Fig. S5C).
Weight loss was more evident in LID mice during the first 5
days following DXR injection, but unlike the controls that continued to lose weight and showed signs of toxicity, LID mice
regained their weight during the following 3 weeks. The second DXR injection (28 mg/kg) caused a considerable amount
of DXR-related deaths in the control (25% survival) but not in
the LID mice (100% survival; Fig. 4D).
DSR in melanoma-bearing LID mice against high-dose
DXR. Next, we tested DSR in vivo by monitoring LID mice
inoculated with a highly aggressive melanoma cell line
(B16Fluc) that metastasizes primarily to the lungs (16) and
treating them with DXR. B16Fluc is a luminescent derivative
of the B16 mouse melanoma cell line. Therefore, tumor progression and regression can be visualized and quantified
in vivo using bioluminescence imaging technology (16). LID
and its control mice were i.v. injected with B16Fluc (2 × 105
cells per mouse) melanoma cells and treated with two cycles
of high-dose DXR (Fig. 5A). Although IGF-I plays a major role
in tumor growth and metastasis (44), both LID and its control
mice started to succumb to metastasis as early as 25 days following cancer inoculation. The two cycles of high-dose DXR
extended survival time by delaying metastasis in all mice

(Fig. 5C). Forty-three percent of control mice died with signs
of DXR-induced cardiac myopathy, whereas none of the LID
mice died from DXR toxicity (Fig. 5D; Supplementary
Fig. S7A). In addition, LID mice showed a slight advantage
in weight maintenance (Supplementary Fig. S8). Ninety days
after cancer inoculation, all control mice that received chemotherapy had died from either cancer metastases or DXR
toxicity, but 60% of LID mice that received two cycles of
high-dose DXR treatment were cancer-free with no apparent
toxic side effects (Fig. 5B and C; Supplementary Fig. S7). All the
LID mice deaths were caused by cancer metastases. The progression of cancer between control and LID mice was similar
after DXR treatments (Supplementary Fig. S7B), suggesting
that the reduction of circulating IGF-I protects the host cells,
but not cancer cells, against high-dose chemotherapy.

Discussion
In a previous report, we described a STS-based DSR
method to protect the host cells, but not cancer cells, against
high-dose chemotherapy. The basis for this seems to be the
existence of a nondividing state, which normal cells enter
in response to starvation for the purpose of investing the
remaining energy resources in cellular protection against
various insults. Here, we show that a major reduction in
circulating IGF-I can protect the host cells, but not cancer
cells, against chemotherapy. Low levels of IGF-I can reduce
intracellular mitogenic signaling pathways, including those
regulated by Ras and Akt, two of the major pathways downstream of the IGF-1R. We believe that the reduction of mitogenic stimuli may protect normal cells in part by inducing
cell cycle arrest (45–47) and in part by shifting the energy
toward protection and repair genes such as FOXO, SODs,
and DNA repair genes (2, 10, 29, 46, 48). In yeast, we have
previously shown that protection can be increased in nondividing cells by up to 1,000-fold, suggesting that a major component of the protective mechanisms is independent of the
switch from a dividing to a nondividing state, at least in this
simple organism (2). This is also in agreement with the effect
of IGF-1R overexpression in sensitizing fibroblasts grown to
confluence to DXR (Fig. 3). On the other hand, cancer cells
are self-sufficient in growth signals, less or not responsive to
physiologic antigrowth signals, and, in many cases, do not
undergo cell cycle arrest due to checkpoint dysregulation
(11, 29, 47). In fact, it has been shown that pretreatment with
nontoxic doses of cell cycle arresting drugs (e.g., DXR) or
growth factor inhibitors (inhibitors of MAP/ERK kinase or
epidermal growth factor receptor) permits selective killing
of checkpoint-deficient cells (49–51).
In support of our hypothesis, our yeast experiments show
that deletion of the homologs of RAS and/or SCH9 (AKT/
S6K) promotes protection against DXR, but expression of
the oncogenic RAS2Val19 reverses this cellular and DNA protection independently of cell division. These results raise the
possibility that oncogenic mutations that activate pathways
such as Ras, AKT, or PKA may reverse the protective effect of
reduced IGF-I signaling in malignant cells, thus allowing
differential protection of host and various cancers. Notably,

Selectively Protecting Normal Cells by Reducing IGF-I

inhibition of the pathway downstream of oncogenic mutations could have either a positive or a negative effect on the
protection of cancer cells. Preclinical studies show that IGF-1R
targeting strategies can be effective in the treatment of multiple myelomas and prostate, breast, and colon cancers in addition to other cancers (38, 52). The antitumor effect seen with
such agents is thought to be dependent on apoptosis resulting
from IGF-1R inactivation (52). However, it must be noted that
IGF-1R blockade could also trigger apoptosis in normal cells
and may not protect against high-dose chemotherapy by interfering with the growth/recovery of certain types of cells
(e.g., bone marrow cells). As observed with our LID mice, reduced IGF-I, unlike IGF-1R blockade, does not cause cancer
cell death but can selectively enhance the resistance of normal
cells against chemotoxicity and may sensitize cancer cells to
chemotherapy. This is in agreement with the normal development of prostatic carcinoma in the LID-TRAMP model (14).
Based on our results from etoposide-treated LID mice, strategies that reduce circulating IGF-I may also increase the
toxicity of certain chemotherapy drugs. Therefore, the compatibility between each drug and IGF-I reduction/blockade
therapy should be carefully tested in preclinical studies before
being considered as a candidate. Although it seems to be central, IGF-I may represent simply one of a number of growth
factors that can activate Ras, Akt, etc., in normal cells and promote cell death in cancer cells and, therefore, only one of the
factors that can be downregulated to provide DSR (47).
In summary, our studies in mice indicate that major reduction in circulating IGF-I and in intracellular IGF-I signaling

enhances the resistance of the host cells, but not of cancer
cells, against chemotherapy, thus providing the foundation
for a method to augment cancer treatment without the need
to fast. However, the combination of fasting and IGF-I reduction could result in an even more pronounced effect.
