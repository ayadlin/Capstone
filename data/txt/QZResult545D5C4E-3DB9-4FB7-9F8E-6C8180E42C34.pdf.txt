ABSTRACT
Ras is aberrantly activated in many cancers and active DNA demethylation plays
a fundamental role to establish DNA methylation pattern which is of importance
to cancer development. However, it was unknown whether and how Ras regulate
DNA demethylation during carcinogenesis. Here we found that Ras downregulated
thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG), a DNA demethylation enzyme, by inhibiting the
interaction of transcription activator ING4 with TDG promoter. TDG recruited histone
lysine demethylase JMJD3 to the Fas promoter and activated its expression, thus
restoring sensitivity to apoptosis. TDG suppressed in vivo tumorigenicity of xenograft
pancreatic cancer. Thus, we speculate that reversing Ras-mediated ING4 inhibition
to activate Fas expression is a potential therapeutic approach for Ras-driven cancers.

silencers to suppress gene expression. Oncogenic Ras
signaling can promote DNA hypermethylation of tumor
suppressor genes (TSGs) to facilitate cancer development
by remodeling cell metabolism and many other
biochemical processes [10–13]. Cytosine methylation
catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) has been
well studied [14]. In contrast, the investigation of active
DNA demethylation in mammalian somatic cells was still
in its infancy [15, 16]. It was unknown whether and how
Ras signaling regulates active DNA demethylation in
human cancer cells.
In this study, we found that active Ras suppressed
the transcription of thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG)
which encodes one of critical proteins to carry out
active DNA demethylation [17, 18]. TDG can recruit
histone lysine demethylase JMJD3 to Fas promoter
and activated its expression to restore sensitivity to
apoptosis. Consequently, TDG effectively suppressed
in vivo tumorigenecity of xenograft pancreatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth common cause of
deaths due to cancer (http://globocan.iarc.fr). It has the
worst 1 and 5 year survival rates of all cancers. Most of
pancreatic cancer are sporadic and common risk factors
include chronic pancreatitis, diabetes, cigarette smoking
and heavy alcohol consumption. Strikingly, more than
90% pancreatic cancer have mutations in Ras oncogene
[1]. Oncogenic point mutations leading to the constitutive
activation of Ras oncoprotein occurs in 30% of human
cancers [2, 3] while epigenetic down-regulation of
inhibitors in Ras signaling pathway represent as alternative
mechanisms for the activation of Ras signaling [4–7].
In addition to genetic mutations, epigenetic changes
mainly deregulation of DNA methylation also contributes
to the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer [8, 9]. DNA
methylation occurring within CpG dinucleotides of
the promoter region usually function as transcriptional

pancreatic cancer and other Ras-driven cancers.

SREBF1, CREB1, HSF1, EGR1 and ING4. However, the
expression of TDG was reduced only in the presence of
ING4 siRNA but not other siRNAs (Figure 2a and 2b). In
addition, ING4 depletion inhibited the luciferase activity
driven by the −391/+26 region (Figure 2c). Meanwhile,
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) further confirmed
the binding of ING4 to TDG promoter in vivo (Figure 2d).
However, such interaction was abrogated in the presence
of Ras, (Figure 2e), leading to the downregulation of TDG
expression (Figure 1). As the consequence, the exogenous
ING4 expression reverted Ras-mediated TDG repression
in H-Ras transformed cells (Figure 2f).

RESULTS
Ras inhibits TDG expression
In order to clarify the relevance of Ras signaling
to active DNA demethylation, we firstly analyzed the
expression of the three most important enzymes involved
in DNA demethylation, TET1 (ten-eleven translocation 1),
AID (activation induced deaminase) and TDG, in Rastransformed NIH3T3 cells. Interestingly, expression of
the three enzymes in transformed cells were decreased
(Figure 1a and 1b, and data not shown). In the current
study we will focus on the regulation of TDG by Ras
whereas the effect of Ras on other two enzymes will be
reported elsewhere.
Then we determined TDG expression after H-Ras
depletion in transformed cells. After treating with H-Ras
siRNA for 72 hrs, either mRNA or protein of TDG was
significantly increased (Figure 1c and 1d). It has been
reported that TDG expression can be inhibited in multiple
myeloma cell lines through promoter methylation
[19], and indeed there is a CpG island around the first
exon of mouse TDG gene. However, TDG mRNA did
not increase after treating the transformed cells with
DNMT inhibitor, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (Supplementary
Figure 1), and TDG was actually not hypermethylated
in both transformed and untransformed NIH 3T3 cells
(Supplementary Figure 1). So we turned to search for
alternative mechanisms responsible for Ras-mediated
TDG downregulation.
By employing a series of luciferase reporter
constructs driven by different length of DNA fragment
cloned from the upstream of TDG transcription start
site (TSS), we finally ascertained the −391/+26 region
was crucial for TDG transcription (Figure 1e). The
transcription activity of −391/+26 region was reduced in
the presence of either active H-Ras or K-Ras (Figure 1f).
Meanwhile, the transcription activity of −391/+26 region
significantly lower in oncogenic Ras transformed NIH3T3
cells than in parental NIH3T3 cells (Figure 1g), confirming
that oncogenic Ras signaling suppressed TDG expression
at the transcription level.

TDG is downregulated in pancreatic cancer
Oncogenic Ras mutations occur in more than
90% of pancreatic cancer of all grades [1], so we next
examined the expression of TDG in human pancreatic
cancer. As expected, TDG were down-regulated in K-Ras
mutated pancreatic cancer cell lines Miapaca-2 and
Panc-1, compared with the Bxpc-3 in which the K-Ras
gene was wild type (Figure 3a and 3b). In addition, TDG
expression in Miapaca-2 and Panc-1 cells were restored
once K-Ras expression was knock-down by its siRNA
(Figure 3c and 3d). We further analyzed TDG expression
in various pancreatic tissues. Importantly, TDG expression
in human pancreatic cancer tissues were significantly
decreased when compared with its expression in normal
pancreas or pancreas with chronic inflammation or benign
tumors (Figure 3e and 3f). However, we failed to find any
significant associations of TDG expression with clinicopathological feature such as differentiation, gender (data
not shown).

TDG functions as a tumor suppressor by
inducing apoptosis
Next, we explored the role of TDG as a tumor
suppressor in pancreatic cancer. Unexpectedly,
overexpression of TDG did not induce cell death or cell
growth arrest in vitro (Supplementary Figure 2). However,
the in vivo growth of tumors formed by pancreatic cancer
cells with ectopic TDG expression was significantly
retarded (Figure 4a 4b and 4c). Moreover, cleavedCaspase3 and -PARP but not Ki-67 was increased in
cells with ectopic TDG expression (Figure 4d and 4e),
indicating that ectopic TDG expression induced cell
apoptosis but not proliferation inhibition.

In order to identify transcription factors that activate
TDG expression, we scanned transcription factor-binding
sites within −391/+26 region (TRANSFAC scoring matrix,
http://www.biobase-international.com/). Several candidate
transcription factors were identified, such as Nrf1, Nrf2,

pathway regulating apoptosis, we treated the TDG
overexpression cells with TNFα and FasL, two major
inducers of extrinsic apoptosis. As shown in Figure 5a
and 5b, FasL but not TNFα inhibited the viability of
TDG overexpressed cells in a concentration dependent
manner, indicating that TDG might promote the
expression of Fas. Indeed, both Western blotting and
flow cytometry assay confirmed the increase of Fas
protein in TDG overexpressing cells (Figure 5c and 5d)
or tumors formed by TDG overexpressing cells
(Figure  4e). Consistently, FasL induced apoptosis of
pancreatic cancer cells only in the presence but not
absence of TDG expression (Figure 5e and 5f).

The role of TDG in promoting active DNA
demethylation indicated that TDG may promote Fas
expression though activating Fas promoter demethylation.
As expected, Fas mRNA level was significantly raised
in TDG overexpressing cells (Figure 6a). However,
promoter hypermethylation seems to be not relevant to the
regulation of Fas expression. 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine failed
to increase Fas mRNA (Supplementary Figure 3) and Fas
promoter was actually not hypermethylated in Miapaca-2
cells (Supplementary Figure 3). In addition to its roles

in active DNA demethylation, TDG also implicated in
transcriptional regulation. Indeed, TDG bound to the
promoter of Fas gene (Figure 6b and 6c). Meanwhile,
the level of H3K27 trimethylation in Fas promoter was
markedly reduced in the presence of TDG expression
(Figure 6b and 6c). Interestingly, TDG could interact with
JMJD3, the major histone demethylase of trimethylated
H3K27 (Figure 6d), and Fas expression were reduced once
JMJD3 was depleted (Figure 6e), indicating that TDG
recruit JMJD3 to facilitate histone H3K27 demethylation
and subsequent Fas transcription (Figure 6f).

[20, 22]. Meanwhile, germline mutations in TDG were also
detected in patients with familial colorectal cancer [21]. On
the other hand, TDG expression in human cancers can also be
regulated by epigenetic changes. For instance, the expression
of TDG could be targeted by miR-29 family [23, 24].
In addition, TDG promoter can be hypermethylated,
leading to the silencing of its expression [19, 25]. However,
we found oncogenic Ras repressed TDG transcription
independent of promoter hypermethylation (Supplementary
Figure 1). Furthermore, we identified a novel mechanism
resulting in the loss of TDG function (Figure 6). Certainly,
we could not exclude other transcription factors important to
activate TDG transcription. It has been reported that TDG is
actually a target of p53 [26]. However, we found no binding
sites for p53 in the minimal promoter region we identified,
indicating that p53 may regulate TDG transcription through
other DNA elements or in a cell-specific manner.
ING4, the newly identified transcription activator of
TDG, is a well-defined tumor suppressor in many types of
cancers [27, 28]. In consistence with its function to activate
TDG transcription, ING4 was found to be crucial for gene
transcription via acetylation of chromatin substrates as a

DISCUSSION
In consideration of its role in DNA repair and
demethylation, TDG may play as a tumor suppressor.
Indeed, loss of TDG function led to the mutator phenotype
and increased susceptibility to carcinogenesis [20, 21]. Such
loss of TDG function was often attributed to genetic changes.
For example, human TDG actually locates at chromosome
12q22-q24.1, one of regions frequently lost in many human
cancers including gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer

consequence of its association with histone acetyltransferase
complex [29]. However, how oncogenic Ras signaling
regulation ING4 function remains further investigations.
Ectopic TDG expression led to the activation of
extrinsic apoptosis through the induction of Fas expression.
Interestingly, oncogenic Ras signaling has been shown to
inhibit apoptosis by regulating the expression of various
players in the apoptosis response [30–32]. As the major
death receptor, Fas was downregulated in many cancer
cells. The predominant mechanism of its downregulation
is promoter hypermethylation [12]. Much to our surprise,
TDG seems to activate Fas transcription independent
of DNA demethylation although it indeed bound to
Fas promoter. Firstly, pharmacological demethylation
failed to increase Fas mRNA. Secondly, bisulfite gene
sequencing revealed that Fas promoter was actually not
hypermethylated in pancreatic cancer cells. Instead, we
found TDG activated Fas expression through epigenetic
chromatin remodeling. It recruited JMJD3 to Fas
promoter and promoted the demethylation of lysine 27 in
Histone 3, which is a well-known marker for active gene
transcription. Interestingly, TDG could interact with the
transcription-activating histone acetyltransferase (CBP/
p300) [33–36], which protected gene promoters from
polycomb repressive complex (PRC) -mediated H3K27
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

trimethylation [37]. However, the transient transfection
of TDG also led to the activation of Fas transcription,
strongly supporting an active demethylation of H3K27.
In conclusion, oncogenic Ras suppressed the
transcription of TDG by inhibiting the interaction of
its transcription activator ING4 with TDG promoter.
TDG functions as a tumor suppressor by promoting the
demethylation of H3K27 in Fas promoter and activating
Fas expression. Therefore, reversing Ras-mediated
downregulation of TDG expression and subsequent Fas
expression could a promising approach for the target
therapy of pancreatic cancer and other Ras-driven cancers.
