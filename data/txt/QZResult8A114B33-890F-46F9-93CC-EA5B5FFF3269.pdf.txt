Abstract
V600E

B-RAF mutation is found in 50% to 60% of melanomas, and the novel agents PLX4032/vemurafenib and
GSK2118436 that inhibit the V600EB-RAF kinase achieve a remarkable clinical response rate. However, as might
be expected, acquired clinical resistance to these agents arises in most melanoma patients. PLX4032/
vemurafenib resistance that arises in vivo in tumor matched short-term cultures or in vitro in melanoma cell
lines is not caused by acquisition of secondary mutations in V600EB-RAF but rather is caused by upregulating
platelet-derived growth factor receptor b (PDGFRb) or N-RAS which results in resistance or sensitivity to
mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated (ERK; MEK) kinase inhibitors, respectively. In
this study, we define a targeted combinatorial strategy to overcome PLX4032/vemurafenib resistance in
melanoma cell lines or short-term culture where the resistance is driven by PDGFRb upregulation, achieving
synergistic growth inhibition and cytotoxicity. PDGFRb-upregulated, PLX4032-resistant (PPRM) cell lines show
dual phospho (p)-ERK and p-AKT upregulation, and their growth inhibitory responses to specific small molecule
inhibitors correlated with p-ERK, p-AKT, and p-p70S6K levels. Coordinate inhibition of V600EB-RAF inhibition
and the RTK–PI3K–AKT–mTORC axis led to functionally significant rebound signaling, illustrating a robust and
dynamic network connectivity. Combined B-RAF, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and mTORC1/2 inhibition
suppressed both immediate early and delayed compensatory signaling, resulting in a highly synergistic growth
inhibitory response but less efficient cytotoxic response. In contrast, the combination of MEK1/2, PI3K, and
mTORC1/2 inhibitors consistently triggered apoptosis in a highly efficient manner. Together, our findings offer a
rational strategy to guide clinical testing in preidentified subsets of patients who relapse during treatment with
V600E
B-RAF inhibitors. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5067–74. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The majority of human melanomas constitutively activate
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
through oncogenic mutations in either N-RAS or B-RAF
(1–3). Targeted inhibition of V600E/KB-RAF (>99% of B-RAF
mutations) in patients with advanced melanoma with
PLX4032/vemurafenib or GSK2118436 (4, 5) showed exquisite V600E/KB-RAF "oncogene addiction." However, acquired
resistance in the majority of patients presents a formidable
obstacle to long-term tumor responses. Recent works aimed
at understanding how melanomas acquire resistance to

V600E/K

B-RAF inhibition point to either MAPK reactivation
(via secondary N-RAS mutations (6) or COT/MAP3K8 kinase
overexpression (7), or activation of a MAPK-redundant
survival pathway (via receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such
as platelet-derived growth factor receptor b (PDGFRb; ref.6)
or insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (8).
The PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway seems to provide this
MAPK-redundant survival pathway (8, 9). Cross-talk between
MAPK and PI3K–AKT–mTOR has been reported in various
cancer types (10–14). The extensive network relationships
between these signaling pathways (15) at nodes of cross-talk
point to treatment-induced compensatory signaling as a
potential barrier to effective targeted cancer therapy. For
instance, inhibition of the MAPK pathway by targeting
[MAP/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; MEK)]
MEK1/2 in melanoma cell lines can result in treatmentinduced AKT activation, mediating resistance (16).
Here, taking advantage of PLX4032/vemurafenib–acquired
resistant cell lines and a short-term culture with defined
PDGFRb upregulation, we show that single target inhibition
of the RTK–PI3K–AKT–mTORC pathway in the presence of BRAF inhibition resulted in powerful and immediate early
(1 hour) rebound survival signaling in either the MAPK pathway (downstream of B-RAF) or PI3K–AKT pathway itself.

complexes (17), synergized with PLX4032/vemurafenib in the
growth inhibition of PPRM cell lines. Furthermore, the combined inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) on top of
dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition, achieved by using the
novel inhibitor BEZ235 (18), overcame delayed, compensatory
signaling at AKT, further augmenting synergy with PLX4032/
vemurafenib. Delayed compensatory signaling at MEK1/2 can
limit the extent of a cytotoxic response, as substituting MEK1/
2 for B-RAF inhibition reduced phospho (p)-ERK recovery and
augmented apoptotic induction in conjunction with dual PI3K
and mTORC1/2 inhibition. Because all these novel inhibitors
and similar targeted agents are undergoing clinical evaluation
(ClinicalTrials.gov), their combination represents a promising
and translatable approach to overcome a subset of melanomas escaping BRAF inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, lentiviral constructs, and infections
All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium with 10% or 20% heat-inactivated FBS (Omega
Scientific), 2 mmol/L glutamine in a humidified 5% CO2
incubator, and 1 mmol/L PLX4032 (if drug resistant). Lentiviral
constructs for wild type PDGFRb overexpression and knockdown (shPDGFRb) have been described (6). Three-dimensional spheroid growth assay was conducted as described
(19). Briefly, PPRM cells were seeded into ultralow attachment
plates (Costar), and spheroids (72 hours) were implanted into
a bovine collagen I matrix (Invitrogen). One representative
spheroid was selected from each well and tracked each day by
photography.
Cellular proliferation and drug treatments
Cell proliferation experiments were carried out in a 96-well
format (5 replicates), and drug treatments initiated at 24 hours
postseeding for 72 hours. Stocks and dilutions of PLX4032
(Plexxikon), AZD6244, BEZ235, MK2206 (Selleck Chemicals),
AKTi (Merck), AZD8055 (ChemieTek), sunitinib, imatinib (LC
Laboratories), rapamycin (Sigma–Aldrich), LY294002, and
wortmannin (Promega) were made in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). Cells were quantified by using CellTiter-GLO Luminescence (Promega) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Spheroids were treated with either DMSO or
indicated drugs at day 1 postimplantation into collagen. At
day 6, spheroids were washed twice in PBS before calcein-AM
and ethidium bromide (Molecular Probes) were added for
1 hour at 37 C prior to fluorescence microscopy.
Protein and apoptosis detection
Cell lysates for Western blotting were made in RIPA (Sigma)
with protease (Roche) and phosphatase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) inhibitor cocktails. Western blots were probed with
antibodies against p-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204), total ERK1/2,
PDGFRb, p-AKT (S473), p-AKT (T308), total AKT1/2, pp70S6K (T389), total p70S6K, p-PDGFRb (Y751) and (Y771)
and p-H2AX (S140), total H2AX (all from Cell Signaling Technologies), and tubulin (Sigma). Apoptotic cells were stained
with Annexin V–V450 (BD Pharmingen) and PI for 15 minutes

at room temperature. Flow cytometry data were analyzed by
the fluorescence-activated cell sorting Express V2 software.
Data processing
Statistical analyses were conducted by using InStat 3 Version 3.0b (GraphPad Software); graphical representations by
using DeltaGraph or Prism (Red Rock Software); and combination index (CI) calculation by using CalcuSyn V2.1 (Biosoft).

Results and Discussion
Individual target (PDGFRb, AKT, mTORC1) inhibition
and compensatory signaling
PPRM cell lines (M229 R5 and M238 R1) harbor a V600EBRAF transcriptional signature upon PLX4032 withdrawal,
indicating persistent MAPK signaling, and their p-ERK levels
remain highly sensitive to PLX4032 treatment, suggesting
MAPK not being the sole survival pathway (6). We examined
the relative levels of p-AKT and p-ERK in M229 R5 and M238
R1 and their isogenic parental cell lines (M229 and M238,
respectively) and found highly elevated levels of both p-ERK
and p-AKT in PPRM cell lines (Fig. 1A). Although Pt48 R, a
culture derived from a PLX4032-acquired resistant melanoma
tumor, lacks an isogenic, drug-sensitive counterpart, it displayed similarly elevated levels of p-AKT and p-ERK (Fig. 1A).
PDGF-BB–treated NIH3T3 cells upregulated the p-AKT level
dramatically and the p-ERK level to a lesser extent (Fig. 1A).
PDGFRb protein upregulation in PPRM cell lines and culture
are associated with its hyperphosphorylation (p-Y751 and pY771 for PI3K and RAS GTPase activating protein docking,
respectively; Supplementary Fig. S1A), which is in turn sensitive to dose-dependent inhibition by imatinib and sunitinib
(multikinase inhibitors with activity against PDGFRb; Supplementary Fig. S1B). Additionally, overexpression of wild-type
PDGFRb with PDGF-BB stimulation in M229 and M238 parental cells caused a dramatic increase in the levels of p-AKT
while having little appreciable effect on the levels of p-ERK
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Conversely, stable knockdown of
PDGFRb in M238 R1 downregulated p-AKT but not p-ERK
levels but paradoxically increased p-AKT in M229 R5, suggesting compensation (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, PDGFRb
upregulation likely drives PI3K-AKT survival signaling,
whereas p-ERK accumulation in PPRM cell lines may be a
consequence of prolonged culture with PLX4032 and loss of
negative feedback, altered RAF usage, signal cross-talk, or as
yet uncharacterized mechanisms (8, 13, 20).
We then systematically tested the potential suppressive
effect of individual inhibitors of the RTK–PI3K–AKT–mTORC
axis on the growth of PPRM cell lines. In cell survival assays
(PPRM cell lines maintained with 1 mmol/L PLX4032, unless
otherwise indicated), imatinib and sunitinib (Fig. 1B and C,
top) as well as the AKT1/2 inhibitor, AKTi (Fig. 1B, top), were
individually inactive against PPRM cell lines. Although AKT1/
2 inhibition dramatically reduced p-AKT levels (Fig. 1B),
making AKT3-mediated survival rescue unlikely, pan-AKT
inhibition by using MK2206 (21) was similarly inactive against
PPRM cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3). As treatment (1 hour)
with imatinib or AKTi caused a rebound increase in p-ERK

levels (Fig. 1B, bottom; Pt48 R data not shown), we asked
whether 0.5 mmol/L of the MEK inhibitor AZD6244, which by
itself is inactive against PPRM cell lines up to 10 mmol/L (6),
could enhance the growth-inhibitory activity of imatinib,
sunitinib, or AKTi (Fig. 1B and C, top). AZD6244 was effective
in sensitizing only M229 R5 to imatinib (IG50 from not
reached, NR; to 2 mmol/L), Pt48 R to sunitinib (IG50 from
1.5 to 0.4 mmol/L), and M229 R5 to AKTi (IG50 from 3 to 0.03
mmol/L). Only AZD6244-induced sensitization of Pt48 R to
sunitinib correlated with p-p70S6K suppression (Fig. 1B and C,
bottom). On the other hand, despite strong suppression of
both p-ERK and p-AKT by combined AKTi þ AZD6244 or
sunitinib þ AZD6244 treatments in M238 R1, the p-p70S6K

level remained refractory to suppression (Fig. 1B and C,
bottom), suggesting a cell context-dependent differences in
mTOR-p70S6K activation, PDGFRb phosphorylation, RASGTP levels, and/or C-RAF usage (8, 22). The inconsistent
growth-suppressive effects of combining RTK (imatinib or
sunitinib) and MAPK (PLX4032 or AZD6244) inhibition are
contrasted to the cell-cycle arresting effects of stable PDGFRb
knockdown as reported earlier (6), as the functional effects of
small molecule inhibitors and short hairpin (shRNA)mediated genetic knockdown should not be viewed as equal
given that the latter (multiple independent shRNAs) produces
a more sustained and specific inhibition of the intended target
than the former ("dirty" kinase inhibitors).

Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTORC1 complex, induced
significant rebound increases in both p-ERK and p-AKT levels,
which were ineffectively counter inhibited by AZD6244 and
AKTi, respectively (Fig. 1D, top). In this context, rapamycininduced mTORC1 inhibition has been shown to activate the
MAPK pathway through a PI3K-dependent feedback loop in
cancer cells (10). Thus, despite near complete downregulation
of p-p70S6K with rapamycin treatment (Fig. 1D, bottom; Pt48
R data not shown), rapamycin titration in the presence of
AZD6244 or both AZD6244 and AKTi was still ineffectual in
growth-inhibiting PPRM cell lines (Fig. 1D, top). In fact,
rapamycin rendered M229 R5 insensitive to combination
treatment with PLX4032, AZD6244, and AKTi (Fig. 1B, top).
The lower degree of rapamycin-induced p-ERK rebound in
M238 R1 may account for the greater degree of p-ERK

suppression on cotreatment with AZD6244 (Fig. 1D, top).
Together, these data argue for extensive RTK–MAPK–AKT
pathway connectivity in PPRM cell lines that affords compensatory survival signaling even with simultaneous inhibition of multiple targets.
Synergistic growth inhibition by combining PI3K,
mTORC1/2, and B-RAF suppression
We then tested the growth-inhibitory effect of the dual
mTORC1/2 inhibitor, AZD8055, on PPRM cell lines. As seen in
Figure 2A, AZD8055 treatment alone suppressed PPRM cell
line growth and p-AKT and p-p70S6K levels. Expectedly,
PLX4032 treatment alone suppressed p-ERK levels. Combination treatment with AZD8055 and PLX4032 was more effective
than either drug treatment alone in growth inhibition,

suggesting that PLX4032-mediated suppression of p-ERK
levels is critical for this synergistic growth inhibition. A
calculation of CI values was consistent with a synergistic
effect (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Table S2). Although the PI3K
inhibitors, LY294002 or wortmannin, in the presence of
PLX4032 were individually inactive against PPRM cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. S4), the dual PI3K and mTORC1/2 inhibitor BEZ235 was highly specific (vs. parental lines) and potent
in growth-inhibiting PPRM cell lines (Fig. 2C). Both M229 R5
and M238 R1 were highly sensitive to BEZ235 compared with
their parental cells (M229, IG50 ¼ 0.2 mmol/L vs. M229 R5, IG50
¼ 0.007 mmol/L; M238, IG50 ¼ 0.5 mmol/L vs. M238 R1, IG50 ¼
0.0001 mmol/L). Pt48 R was similarly highly sensitive to
BEZ235 (IG50 ¼ 0.01 mmol/L). Notably, we found that
PLX4032 dramatically enhanced the efficacy of BEZ235
(Fig. 2C), resulting in a highly synergistic CI (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Table S2). Despite the potent growth-inhibitory effect
of BEZ235 combined with PLX4032, incomplete growth inhibition at high drug concentrations suggests ineffective cell
death induction over the duration of the assay (see below). A
high degree of synergy between AZD8055 (or BEZ235) and

PLX4032 in growth-inhibiting PPRM cell lines strongly indicates that MAPK remains a functional survival pathway
redundant to and cooperative with the AKT pathway.
Importance of sustained pathway suppression
The higher degree of synergy observed with the PLX4032
and BEZ235 versus the PLX4032 and AZD8055 combination
could not be explained by the level of p-ERK, p-AKT, and pp70S6K suppression at 1 hour of drug treatments alone or in
combination (Fig. 2A and C, bottom). Thus, we posited that
PI3K may serve as a node of delayed retrograde, rebound
signaling and its coinhibition may facilitate sustained p-AKT
suppression. Indeed, at 24 hours (vs. 1 hour; Fig. 2A and C,
bottom) of drug treatment, we found a significant re-accumulation of p-AKT with mTORC1/2 suppression by
AZD8055, suggesting a delayed PI3K-PDK-1–dependent
phosphorylation and activation of p-AKT (Fig. 3A). In contrast, PI3K and mTORC1/2 concomitant suppression by
BEZ235 led to sustained p-AKT suppression at 24 hours.
This differential p-AKT recovery did not seem to impact pp70S6K levels, occurred regardless of PLX4032 treatment

Combinatorial Targeting of PLX4032/Vemurafenib-Resistant Melanoma

A critical role for MEK1/2 inhibition in cooperative
cytotoxicity
Effective growth inhibition of PPRM cell lines with BEZ235
and PLX4032 correlated with little if any appreciable apoptosis
at day 4 (Supplementary Fig. S5), despite strong suppression of
p-AKT and p-p70S6K levels (Fig. 3A and B). To address this
apparent paradox, we noted significant p-ERK recovery at 24
hours post-PLX4032 treatment (Fig. 3A), which was not
apparent at 24 hours post-AZD6244 treatment (Fig. 3C). We
thus tracked delayed compensatory p-ERK recovery postPLX4032 versus AZD6244 treatments, with or without
AZD8055 or BEZ235 treatments (Fig. 3D). Indeed, PLX4032
treatment was followed by rapid (6 hours) and significant
levels of p-ERK recovery (back to the baseline p-ERK levels in
M229 R5 and M238 R1). Curiously, mTORC1/2 inhibition
enhanced p-ERK recovery after PLX4032 treatment
(Fig. 3D), consistent with earlier experiments (Fig. 2A and
C, bottom). Importantly, AZD62444 treatment, compared with
PLX4032 treatment, strongly attenuated p-ERK recovery
extending to 48 hours (Fig. 3D), even in the presence of
mTORC1/2 cotargeting. This dramatic difference in p-ERK
recovery in response to PLX4032 versus AZD6244 treatment is
not likely to be because of differential inhibitor retention/
metabolism, as the difference was noted as early as 6 hours
posttreatments, the inhibitor concentrations used were identical (1 mmol/L), and the IG50 values of PLX4032 and AZD6244
against the parental line M229 are quite similar, suggesting
similar pharmacokinetic and MAPK pharmacodynamic properties (Supplementary Fig. S6).
We then confirmed the potent growth inhibitory combination of MAPK (via PLX4032 or AZD6244) and dual PI3K and
mTORC1/2 (via BEZ235) suppression uncovered in 2-dimensional cultures in 3-dimensional spheroid assays of live versus
dead cells in a collagen I matrix (Fig. 4A and Supplementary
Fig. S7). To quantify apoptotic cells directly, we measured
Annexin V–propidium iodide staining and asked whether
AZD6244, which is associated with attenuated p-ERK recovery
compared with PLX4032, would synergize with BEZ235 to
induced cytotoxicity. By day 5 (M229 R5, Pt48 R) or day 6
(M238 R1) of drug treatments, low levels of apoptosis were
detectable with BEZ235 treatment alone or combined treatment with PLX4032 (Fig. 4B). PLX4032 (vs. DMSO) treatment
alone expectedly caused minimally elevated levels of apopto-

sis. In Pt48 R, the BEZ235/PLX4032 combination induced a
level of apoptosis that was more than additive (Fig. 4B),
correlating with the least degree of p-ERK recovery on
PLX4032 treatment in this cell line (Fig. 3A and D). Notably,
AZD6244 strongly synergized with BEZ235 in apoptosis induction in all PPRM cell lines (Fig. 4C), consistent with apoptosis
tracking by using an alternative marker (p-H2AX levels, Supplementary Fig. S8).
Thus, studies of these cell line models of RTK driven,
PLX4032/vemurafenib acquired resistance pointed to a common feature of hyperactive AKT which extensively crosstalks
with the MAPK pathway, permitting compensatory survival
signaling with insufficient number of target inhibition. Sustained and combined suppression of the MAPK pathway and
the PI3K–AKT–mTORC axis appeared to be critical to overcome PLX4032/vemurafenib acquired resistance. This study
highlights the need not only to identify mechanisms of
acquired resistance to targeted kinase inhibitors but also to
understand the signaling network associated with each
mechanism to generalize potential translatable approaches
to overcome drug resistance.
