ABSTRACT:
Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are increasingly employed as therapeutic targets
in oncology. We have shown that Hsp32, also known as heme oxygenase-1 (HO1), serves as survival factor and potential target in Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia.
We here report that primary cells and cell lines derived from patients with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) express Hsp32 mRNA and the Hsp32 protein in a
constitutive manner. Highly enriched CD34+/CD38− ALL stem cells also expressed
Hsp32. Two Hsp32-targeting drugs, pegylated zinc protoporphyrine (PEG-ZnPP) and
styrene maleic acid-micelle-encapsulated ZnPP (SMA-ZnPP), induced apoptosis and
growth arrest in the BCR/ABL1+ cell lines, in Ph− lymphoblastic cell lines and in
primary Ph+ and Ph− ALL cells. The effects of PEG-ZnPP and SMA-ZnPP on growth of
leukemic cells were dose-dependent. In Ph+ ALL, major growth-inhibitory effects of
the Hsp32-targeting drugs were observed in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant
cells. Hsp32-targeting drugs were found to synergize with imatinib, nilotinib, and
bendamustine in producing growth inhibition and apoptosis in Ph+ ALL cells. A siRNA
against Hsp32 was found to inhibit growth and survival of ALL cells and to synergize
with imatinib in suppressing the growth of ALL cells. In conclusion, Hsp32 is an
essential survival factor and potential new target in ALL.

INTRODUCTION

fusion gene, BCR/ABL1 [1-6]. In the ´pre-imatinib-era´,
these patients had an extremely poor prognosis compared
to patients with Ph- ALL [5,6]. Since then the prognosis
of patients with BCR/ABL1+ ALL has improved, which
is largely attributable to the effects of novel BCR/ABL1targeting drugs [7-12]. In fact, the BCR/ABL1 tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib is effective in most patients
with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL, and sometimes even in
patients with chemotherapy-resistant or relapsed Ph+ ALL,

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a lifethreatening neoplasm characterized by uncontrolled
growth and leukemic expansion of immature lymphoblastic
progenitor cells [1-4]. The prognosis and outcome in ALL
depend on age, molecular defects and response to therapy
[1-6]. In about 30% of all adult patients, leukemic cells
display the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) and the related

especially when applied in combination with conventional
chemotherapy [7-13]. Second- and third generation BCR/
ABL1 blockers are also effective in patients with Ph+ ALL
[14].
However, not all patients with Ph+ ALL respond
to standard treatment and TKI. Therefore, depending on
age, risk factors, and availability of a donor, stem cell
transplantation (SCT) is recommended for patients with
drug-resistant and high risk ALL [15-18]. In these patients,
the overall treatment plan often combines chemotherapy,
SCT and BCR/ABL1-targeting drugs [17]. However,
despite SCT and the availability of novel targeted drugs,
not all patients with Ph+ ALL can be cured. Therefore,
current research focuses on identifying new targets and
drugs that can be employed in these patients and may
improve outcome and survival in ALL the future.
One class of interesting new targets in oncology
are heat shock proteins (Hsp). These proteins often act
as survival factors and are expressed in neoplastic cells
in a constitutive manner [19]. Heat shock protein 32
(Hsp32), also known as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), is a
stress-related cytoprotective molecule that is expressed in
normal and neoplastic cells, including myeloid leukemias
[20-28]. In neoplastic cells, Hsp32 is considered to play
a major role as an essential survival factor [22-29]. We
have recently shown that Hsp32 (HO-1) is expressed in
leukemic cells in Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
and that Hsp32-targeting drugs produce growth arrest and
apoptosis in leukemic cells [28,29].
In the present study, we show that Hsp32 is
expressed in leukemic cells in Ph+ and Ph− ALL, and
that pharmacologic inhibitors of Hsp32 suppress the
growth of imatinib-sensitive as well as imatinib-resistant
ALL cells. Moreover, we show that drug combinations
consisting of Hsp32 inhibitors and either BCR/ABL1 TKI
or bendamustin, can produce synergistic growth-inhibitory
effects in imatinib-resistant ALL cells.

ALL cells (Figure 1B and 1C). Since leukemic stem
cells are considered a major target of therapy, we were
also interested to know whether CD34+/CD38− stem
cells in ALL express Hsp32. In these experiments, we
were able to show that highly enriched (sorted) CD34+/
CD38− ALL stem cells as well as CD34+/CD38+ progenitor
cells express Hsp32 mRNA in patients with Ph+ ALL and
patients with Ph− ALL (Figure 1D).

BCR/ABL1-targeting drugs down
expression of Hsp32 in ALL cells

We have recently shown that expression of Hsp32 in
CML cells is triggered by BCR/ABL1 [28,29]. Therefore,
we were interested to learn whether BCR/ABL1-targeting
drugs would alter expression of Hsp32 in Ph+ ALL cells.
As assessed by qPCR, imatinib was found to down
regulate expression of Hsp32 mRNA in the Ph+ ALL
cell lines TOM-1 and NALM-1 (Figure 2A). In contrast,
imatinib did not suppress expression of Hsp32 mRNA
in the Ph− ALL cell lines tested (Figure 2A). These data
suggest that BCR/ABL1 is involved in the expression of
Hsp32 in Ph+ ALL, whereas in Ph− ALL, other mechanisms
contribute to Hsp32 expression.

Depletion of Hsp32 leads to apoptosis and growth
arrest in ALL cells
Hsp32 is a well-known survival factor that
counteracts apoptosis in various cell types. To investigate
the functional role of Hsp32 in ALL cells, expression of
Hsp32 was specifically silenced by siRNA in the Ph+ ALL
cell lines TOM-1 and NALM-1 and in the Ph− cell line
Raji. The siRNA-induced knockdown of Hsp32 was found
to be associated with a significant decrease in cell viability
due to an increase of apoptotic cells (Figure 2B). A control
siRNA (against Luc) showed no substantial effect on
expression of Hsp32 and no effect on survival (apoptosis)
of ALL cells (Figure 2B). As expected, the siRNA-induced
knock-down of Hsp32 also induced growth arrest in the
ALL cell lines tested (Figure 2B).

RESULTS
ALL cells express Hsp32 mRNA and the Hsp32
protein

Effects of pharmacologic inhibitors of Hsp32 on
growth of ALL cell lines

As assessed by qPCR, primary ALL cells as well
as the ALL cell lines tested were found to express Hsp32
mRNA (Figure 1A, Tables 1 and 2). Hsp32 transcripts
were present in Ph+ ALL cells as well as in Ph− ALL cells
(Figure 1A). Hemin was found to promote expression
of Hsp23 mRNA in all ALL samples tested (Figure
1A). We were also able to show that ALL cells display
the Hsp32 protein. Expression of the Hsp32 protein was
demonstrable by immunocytochemistry (Figure 1B) as
well as by Western blotting (Figure 1C), and hemin was
found to upregulate expression of the Hsp32 protein in

regulate

To evaluate the role of Hsp32 as a potential
therapeutic target in ALL cells, two water-soluble
pharmacologic inhibitors were applied, SMA-ZnPP
and PEG-ZnPP. As assessed by 3H-thymidine uptake,
both Hsp32-targeting drugs were found to inhibit the
proliferation of Ph+ and Ph− ALL cells (primary cells and
cell lines) after 48 hours of incubation (Figure 2C and
Figure 2D). The effects of both drugs on growth of ALL
cells were dose-dependent, with comparable IC50 values

the text. Cell lines were cultured in control medium or in various concentrations of the Hsp32 (HO-1) inhibitors SMA-ZnPP or PEG-ZnPP, or in the presence
of various concentrations of the BCR/ABL1 kinase blockers imatinib or nilotinib for 48 hours. Thereafter, proliferation was measured by 3H-thymidine

values (µM) represent the mean from at least 3 independent experiments. n.t., not tested.

(Tables 1 and 2).

PEG-ZnPP on ALL cells were demonstrable by light
microscopy (Figure 3A and 3B) as well as in a Tunel assay
(Figure 3C). Furthermore, we were able to show by flow
cytometry that SMA-ZnPP induces activation of caspase-3
in ALL cells (Figure 3D). In normal bone marrow cells,
neither SMA-ZnPP nor PEG-ZnPP were found to induce
apoptosis over the dose-range tested (1-40 µM) confirming
previous data [29].

Hsp32-targeting drugs suppress the growth
of leukemic cells from patients with imatinibresistant ALL
In a substantial number of patients with ALL,
leukemic cells develop resistance to imatinib. We were
therefore interested to know whether Hsp32-targeting
drugs can suppress the growth of leukemic cells from
patients with imatinib-resistant Ph+ ALL. In these
experiments, SMA-ZnPP and PEG-ZnPP were found to
inhibit growth of primary, imatinib-resistant leukemic
cells in a dose-dependent manner in all patients examined
(Figure 2C, Table 1), including one patient with lymphoid
blast phase exhibiting BCR/ABL T315I (Table 1).

Hsp32-targeting drugs synergize with BCR/
ABL1-targeting drugs (imatinib, nilotinib)
and with bendamustine in producing growth
inhibition in ALL cells
Next, we examined cooperative drug effects on
growth and survival (apoptosis) of ALL cells. We found
that Hsp32-targeting drugs synergize with BCR/ABL1
TKI and with bendamustin in inducing growth inhibition
and apoptosis in ALL cells (Figure 4A-C). To further
validate Hsp32 as a potential drug-partner of TKI in ALL
cells, we applied siRNA against Hsp32 and measured
the proliferation of ALL cells as well as the response to
imatinib. In these experiments, suboptimal concentrations
of imatinib were applied. As shown in Figure 4D, addition
of Hsp32-specific siRNA was found to potentiate the
effects of imatinib on both ALL cell lines examined,
TOM-1 and NALM-1.

The growth-inhibitory effects of PEG-ZnPP and
SMA-ZnPP on ALL cells are associated with
induction of apoptosis
Hsp32 has been described as a survival factor
counteracting apoptosis in various neoplastic cells. We
next investigated whether the growth-inhibitory effects
of Hsp32 inhibitors (SMA-ZnPP and PEG-ZnPP) are
associated with induction of apoptosis in ALL cells. We
found that both drugs induce apoptosis in primary ALL
cells and in the ALL cell lines tested (Figure 3 and Table
2). The apoptosis-producing effects of SMA-ZnPP and

DISCUSSION

ZnPP, have been developed and tested in experimental
solid tumors [22-27]. In the current study these two
inhibitors were applied to target Hsp32 in ALL cells. Both
inhibitors were found to downregulate growth and survival
in primary (Ph+ and Ph−) ALL cells as well as in all ALL
cell lines tested. By contrast, the Hsp32 inhibitors showed
no major effects on viability of normal cells [28]. All in
all, these data suggest that pharmacologic targeting of
Hsp32 in ALL cells may result in their selective apoptosis
and growth arrest.
A major clinical challenge in the treatment of ALL is
resistance to imatinib and other BCR/ABL1 TKI [10-13].
Therefore, a number of novel agents and pharmacologic
approaches are currently under investigation, with the
aim to overcome drug-resistance. In the present study,
we found that PEG-ZnPP and SMA-ZnPP induce growth
arrest and apoptosis not only in imatinib-sensitive ALL
cells but also in imatinib-resistant cells, which may be
of clinical interest. These data are also in line with our
previous observations that Hsp32 inhibitors block the
growth of imatinib-resistant CML cells as well as Ba/
F3 cells expressing various imatinib-resistant mutants
of BCR/ABL1, including the T315I mutant that renders
BCR/ABL1 resistant against all currently available BCR/
ABL1 TKI [29]. In the present study, we examined one
CML patient in lymphoid blast phase exhibiting the T315I
mutant. As expected, both PEG-ZnPP and SMA-ZnPP
were found to suppress the growth of leukemic cells in this
patient. Together, our data suggest that targeting of Hsp32
may be an interesting approach to treat patients with drugresistant Ph+ ALL or lymphoid blast phase of CML.
An attractive strategy to overcome drug resistance
in leukemias is to combine various targeted drugs with
each other or with conventional drugs. The data of our
study show that Hsp32-targeting drugs synergize with
imatinib and with nilotinib as well as with bendamustine
in producing growth inhibition in Ph+ and Ph− ALL cells.
These synergistic drug effects were seen in imatinibsensitive as well as in imatinib-resistant ALL cells,
supporting the notion that Hsp32 may be an attractive
new therapeutic target in this disease. This hypothesis was
further supported by the observation that siRNA against
HO-1 substantially augments the growth-inhibitory effects
of imatinib on ALL cells.
In summary, our data show that Hsp32 is an
important survival factor and potential new target in
leukemic cells in Ph+ and Ph− ALL, including patients
with TKI-resistant disease. Clinical studies are now
warranted to show whether targeting of Hsp32 alone or in
combination with BCR/ABL1 TKI or other inhibitors, can
induce clinically relevant responses in patients.

Recent data suggest that Hsp32 is an important
survival factor and potential target in various malignant
cells [22-27]. We have recently shown that CML cells
constitutively express Hsp32 and that the disease-related
oncoprotein BCR/ABL1 promotes expression of Hsp32
in Ba/F3 cells [28,29]. In the present study, we show
that Hsp32 is also expressed and serves as an essential
´survival-molecule´ in Ph+ and Ph− ALL cells. Our data
also show that Hsp32-targeting drugs induce apoptosis and
growth arrest in ALL cells and synergize with BCR/ABL1
TKI and with bendamustin in producing growth inhibition
in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant ALL cells.
Together, these data suggest that Hsp32 is a potential new
target in ALL.
Expression of Hsp32 in ALL cells was
demonstrable by qPCR and Western blotting as well as
by immunocytochemistry. Interestingly, both the Ph+ ALL
cells and Ph− ALL cells were found to express Hsp32,
suggesting that apart from BCR/ABL1, other mechanisms
and molecules may also contribute to expression of this
´survival-molecule´ in leukemic cells. Baseline levels of
Hsp32 were comparable in Ph+ and Ph− ALL cells and
were upregulated by hemin.
In Ph+ CML, BCR/ABL1 promotes the expression
of Hsp32 in leukemic cells [28]. To explore the potential
role of this pathway in expression of Hsp32 in Ph+ ALL
cells, we treated these cells with BCR/ABL1-targeting
drugs. We found that BCR/ABL1 TKI downregulate the
expression of Hsp32 mRNA in Ph+ ALL cells. These data
suggest that BCR/ABL1 may contribute to expression
of Hsp32 in Ph+ ALL cells. However, as mentioned,
Hsp32 was also detectable in Ph− ALL cells. From these
data, we hypothesize that expression of Hsp32 can also
be triggered by other pathways in ALL cells. Indeed it
has been described that several different oncoproteins,
including JAK2 V617F, KIT D816V or RAS G12V induce
expression of Hsp32/HO-1 in neoplastic cells [30]. The
exact nature of additional HO-1-promoting oncogenic
lesions in ALL cells remains at present unknown.
Alternatively, Hsp32 expression in ALL cells may
also be regulated by external factors. In this regard it is
noteworthy that Hsp32 is an established “stress-induced”
survival factor in various physiologic cells and that several
different stimuli, including chemotherapy agents, can
induce expression of Hsp32/HO-1 in malignant cells [30].
To demonstrate that Hsp32 serves as a survival
factor in ALL cells, we performed experiments using
ALL cell lines and siRNA against Hsp32. The observation
that the siRNA-induced knock-down is associated with
apoptosis and growth arrest in these cells suggests that
Hsp32 serves as an important survival factor in ALL cells
and thus may represent a potential therapeutic target.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Pegylated zinc protoporphyrin (PEG-ZnPP) and
ZnPP encapsulated in the micelle of styrene maleic acid
(SMA-ZnPP), were produced as described previously
[31-33]. Imatinib and nilotinib (AMN107) were kindly
provided by Dr.E.Buchdunger and Dr.P.W.Manley
(Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland). Bendamustine
was kindly provided by Dr.D.Guggi (Mundipharma,
Vienna, Austria). RPMI 1640 medium and fetal calf serum
(FCS) were purchased from PAA laboratories (Pasching,
Austria), hemin and bovine serum albumin (BSA) from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo), and lipofectin from
Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen), random primers, First Strand buffer,
dNTPs (100 mM), and RNasin (all from Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer`s instructions. PCR
was performed using primers specific for Hsp32
and ABL: Hsp32: 5´-CAGGATTTGTCAGAGGCC
CTGAAGG-3´
(forward),
5´-TGTGGTACAGGGAGGCCATCACC-3´ (reverse);
ABL:
5´-TGTATGATTTTGTGGCCAGTGGAG-3´
(forward), and 5´-GCCTA AGACCCGGAGCTTTTCA-3´
(reverse). mRNA levels were quantified on a 7900HT
Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystem, Foster
City, CA) using iTAq SYBR Green Supermix with ROX
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Hsp32 mRNA expression levels
were normalized to ABL mRNA levels. Calculations were
based on standard curves established for Hsp32 and ABL
mRNA expression. Hsp32 mRNA levels were expressed
as percentage of ABL mRNA.

Primary ALL cells and cell lines

Immunocytochemistry

For in vitro culture experiments, primary leukemic
cells were obtained from 11 patients with Ph+ ALL, 15
with Ph− ALL, 4 with T-ALL, 2 with biphenotypic acute
leukemia, and one with a lymphoid blast phase of CML
with BCR/ABL1 T315I. For polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) analysis, frozen samples from 10 patients with Ph+
ALL and 10 with Ph− ALL were used. In 8 patients (5 with
Ph+ ALL and 3 with Ph- ALL), CD34+/CD38− cells and
CD34+/CD38+ cells were purified by cell sorting (purity
>98%) as described [34]. The patients´ characteristics are
shown in Table 1. Written informed consent was obtained
in each case. The study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Medical University of Vienna, Austria.
The following Ph+ ALL cell lines were used: Z-119, BV173, TOM-1, and NALM-1. In addition, a number of Ph−
lymphatic cell lines were used: Raji, Ramos, REH, and
BL-41. Z-119 cells were kindly provided to J.V.M. by
Dr. Zeev Estrov (MD Anderson Cancer Centre, Houston,
Texas, USA). All other cell lines were purchased from
the Leibnitz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of
Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig,
Germany). The identity of the cell lines was reconfirmed
by DNA sequencing and DNA profiling (by nonaplex
PCR) and by studying the presence or absence of BCR/
ABL1. Cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and
20% heat-inactivated FCS at 37°C and 5% CO2. Table 2
shows a summary of characteristics of cell lines tested in
this study.

Immunocytochemistry was performed on cytospinslides prepared with primary neoplastic cells, sorted ALL
stem cells, and cell lines. A polyclonal rabbit anti- HO-1
(anti-Hsp32) antibody (Stressgen, Ann Arbor, MI; dilution
1:100) and a biotinylated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Biocare,
San Diego, CA) were applied essentially as described
[28,35]. Slides were incubated with the primary antibody
overnight, washed, and were then incubated with secondstep antibody for 30 minutes. Streptavidin-alkalinephosphatase complex (Biocare) was used as chromogen.
Antibody reactivity was made visible using Neofuchsin
(Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan). Slides were counterstained in
Mayer`s hemalaun. In control experiments, the primary
antibody was preincubated with control buffer or a Hsp32specific blocking peptide (Stressgen) before being applied.

Reagents

Western blotting
The Ph+ cell line Z-119 and the Ph− cell line BL-41
were incubated with hemin (10 µM, 37°C, 8 hours) before
being analyzed. Western blotting was performed using a
polyclonal rabbit anti-Hsp32 antibody (Stressgen) and an
anti--actin antibody (Santa Cruz), as described [28,35].
Antibody reactivity was made visible by donkey antirabbit IgG antibody and Lumigen PS-3 detection reagent
(both from GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).

citrate. Then, cells were washed and incubated in terminaltransferase reaction-solution for 60 minutes at 37°C. Cells
were analyzed under a Carl Zeiss Imager. A1 microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For caspase 3 detection,
cell lines were incubated in control medium or in various
concentrations of SMA-ZnPP (5-20 µM) at 37°C for
48 hours. Then, cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde
(room temperature, 10 minutes), permeabilized in 100%
methanol at -20°C (15 minutes), washed in PBS plus BSA
(0.1%), and then stained with the FITC-conjugated mAb
C92-605 (Becton Dickinson Biosciences) directed against
active caspase 3 for 1 hour. Thereafter, cells were analyzed
by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson
Biosciences).

Proliferation assay

Statistical analysis

To examine anti-proliferative effects of PEG-ZnPP
and SMA-ZnPP, Ph+ and Ph− ALL cell lines and primary
ALL cells were cultured in 96-well microtiter plates (5 x
104 cells per well) in the absence or presence of various
concentrations of PEG-ZnPP or SMA-ZnPP for 48 hours,
followed by addition of 3H-thymidine (0.5 µCi per well)
for 16 hours. Cells were harvested on filter membranes
(Packard Bioscience, Meriden, CT) in a Filtermate 96
harvester (Packard Bioscience). Filters were air-dried, and
the bound radioactivity was measured in a -counter (TopCount NXT, Packard Bioscience). All experiments were
performed in triplicate. In a separate set of experiments,
cell lines were cultured in the presence of various drug
combinations at a fixed concentration-ratio for each
combination: PEG-ZnPP+imatinib, PEG-ZnPP+nilotinib,
PEG-ZnPP+bendamustine, SMA-ZnPP+imatinib, SMAZnPP+nilotinib, and SMA-ZnPP+bendamustine.

The paired Student´s t test was applied in growth
inhibition-experiments. Results were considered to be
significantly different, when the p-value was <0.05.
Drug combination effects (additive versus synergistic)
were determined by calculating the combination index
(CI) values using Calcusyn software (Calcusyn; Biosoft,
Ferguson, MO) [37]. A CI value of 1 indicates additive
effects and a CI below 1 indicates synergistic drug
interactions.
