ABSTRACT
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play major roles in cancer initiation, metastasis,
recurrence and therapeutic resistance. Targeting CSCs represents a promising strategy
for cancer treatment. The purpose of this study was to identify selective inhibitors
of breast CSCs (BCSCs). We carried out a cell-based phenotypic screening with cell
viability as a primary endpoint, using a collection of 2,546 FDA-approved drugs and
drug-like molecules in spheres formed by malignant human breast gland-derived cells
(HMLER-shEcad cells, representing BCSCs) and control immortalized non-tumorigenic
human mammary cells (HMLE cells, representing normal stem cells). 19 compounds
were identified from screening. The chemically related molecules benztropine
mesylate and deptropine citrate were selected for further validation and both potently
inhibited sphere formation and self-renewal of BCSCs in vitro. Benztropine mesylate
treatment decreased cell subpopulations with high ALDH activity and with a CD44+/
CD24- phenotype. In vivo, benztropine mesylate inhibited tumor-initiating potential in
a 4T1 mouse model. Functional studies indicated that benztropine mesylate inhibits
functions of CSCs via the acetylcholine receptors, dopamine transporters/receptors,
and/or histamine receptors. In summary, our findings identify benztropine mesylate
as an inhibitor of BCSCs in vitro and in vivo. This study also provides a screening
platform for identification of additional anti-CSC agents.

differentiating cells, which can generate the full repertoire
of tumor cells including both tumorigenic cells and nontumorigenic cells [12]. From a therapeutic perspective, the
selective targeting of CSCs could be an efficient approach
to control cancer growth.
Several agents have been identified that may
selectively target CSCs. Salinomycin exhibited inhibitory
effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)induced breast cancer SCs and reduced the CD44+/CD24subpopulation [13]. Metformin, a first-line drug used
for treating type II diabetes, was reported to selectively
kill a chemotherapy-resistant subpopulation of CSCs
in an in vivo breast cancer model [14]. Dasatinib may
preferentially inhibit the growth of breast cancers with
an EMT-stem cell-like phenotype, particularly of triplenegative cancers of the basal-like subtype [15].
Due to the fact that the CSC subpopulations in
tumors are very small, the collection of large numbers

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women
worldwide, and is also the second leading cause of
cancer death in women. Breast cancer patients are treated
with cytotoxic, anti-hormonal and immunotherapeutic
agents targeting HER-2 in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant
and metastatic settings, depending on the molecular and
biological characteristics of the cancer. However, drug
resistance is a major problem [1] and increasing evidence
indicates that a possible cause for treatment failure is the
existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) [2–6].
The CSC hypothesis proposes that a small
subpopulation of slow-growing tumor cells have selfrenewal ability and drive tumorigenesis, progression and
metastasis [7–11]. The differentiation ability of CSCs
contributes to tumor cellular heterogeneity and it can
give rise to a hierarchy of proliferative and progressively

1.5±0.155%, p<0.01) (Supplementary Figure S1C-D).
Gene expression measurements by qRT-PCR showed
that expression of BCSC related genes, including CD44,
ALDH1, CD133, SLUG, FOXC2 and OCT4 was increased
in HMLER-shEcad spheres compared with the adherent
cells (Supplementary Figure S1E and Supplementary
Table S1).

of CSCs that can be used for drug screening is a great
challenge. Different strategies have been applied to
enrich CSCs, including cell sorting based on cell-surface
markers [10], isolation of dye-exclusion side population
cells [16, 17], sphere formation [18], resistance to
chemotherapeutic compounds [3], EMT induction [19]
and high activity of the intracellular enzyme aldehyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH) [20, 21]. A combination of
different methods for CSC enrichment may enrich for
cancer cells at a higher level of cancer hierarchy and be
more suitable for drug development [22].
The aims of the present study were to establish
a simple, reliable and cost-efficient method to screen
for selective CSC-targeting drugs and to identify drug
candidates for further preclinical studies and potential
clinical development. In an effort to derive sufficient
CSCs for primary screening, we used EMT-induced
CSCs (HMLER-shEcad cells) [13, 19] and applied the
sphere culture technique to enrich CSCs further. We also
used immortalized non-tumorigenic human mammary
(HMLE cells) adherent cells and spheres as controls [19].
We screened a drug library containing FDA-approved
compounds (Prestwick library) and a small chemical
library with high structural and chemical diversity (NCIDTP diversity set II) to identify inhibitors of breast
CSCs (BCSCs). We identified nineteen compounds that
predominantly inhibited the growth of BCSC-enriched
spheres, without major influence on normal stem cell
-enriched spheres. One group of compounds with the
same chemical core structure (benztropine mesylate and
deptropine citrate) was identified and further analyzed
with regard to the inhibition of functional properties of
CSCs in vitro and in vivo.

Identification of compounds with specific
inhibition of spheroid CSCs via cell-based
phenotypic screening
The above results confirmed that a subpopulation
of cells with CSC properties became enriched during
mammosphere formation. Therefore, we hypothesized
that compounds with a selective inhibition of the HMLERshEcad spheres might have inhibitory activity on CSCs.
For the compound library screening, we first cultured
HMLE cells and HMLER-shEcad cells in suspension
with SCM to generate sufficient spheres for screening.
The primary spheres were dissociated and used to generate
subsequent sphere generations, which were used in the
screening platform (from the third to the fifth generation).
Cells from each cell line were seeded in 96-well plates,
allowed to proliferate for 24 h, treated with the compounds
of the chemical libraries at 10 µM, and assayed for cell
viability after 3 days of incubation (Figure 1A). The
screening of 2,546 small molecules was done in two
independent experiments with a very high inter-assay
correlation (Figure 1B–1C, r>0.7). Thus, the protocol
enabled consistent generation of high quality sample spots,
which was necessary to ensure that sufficient precision in
determining deficient samples was achieved and the risk of
producing false negative hits was minimized.
Approximately 6.0% (152 of 2,546) of the test
compounds reduced the viability of HMLER-shEcad
spheres by more than 50% (Figure 1D–1E). Out of
these, nine compounds from the NCI-DTP diversity
Set II (hit ratio: 0.66%) (Figure 1F) and ten compounds
from the Prestwick library decreased the viability of
control HMLE spheres by 30% or less (hit ratio: 0.80%)
(Figure 1G). Among these nineteen hits, three groups of
compounds with the same chemical core structures were
identified. NSC42199 (from NCI-DTP diversity Set II)
and Prestw-1236 (from Prestwick library) are benztropine
mesylate. Prestw-1013 (deptropine citrate) and benztropine
mesylate share the same chemical core structure
(diphenylmethane), as do Prestw-389 (ketoconazole) and
Prestw-1229 (aripiprazole) (phenylpiperazine), as well as
Prestw-899 (adrenosterone) and NSC27592 (tomatidine)
(dimethyldecahydronaphthalene) (Figure 2A). Cell
viability was further assessed over a wide range of doses
to calculate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) for each compound. The dose-response curves
demonstrated that the cell viability of HMLER-shEcad

RESULTS
Mammospheres generated from HMLERshEcad BCSCs
A major challenge in cell-based phenotypic
screening is the limited number of CSCs in cancer
cell cultures. To increase CSC numbers, we generated
mammospheres from EMT-induced CSCs (HMLERshEcad cells) and examined whether this might further
enrich CSCs compared to adherent culture conditions.
CSCs mostly maintain quiescence or are slow-cycling
[23]. The HMLER-shEcad spheres demonstrated
a significant decrease in proliferation compared to
adherent HMLER-shEcad cells (Supplementary Figure
S1A; two-way ANOVA, p<0.001). HMLER-shEcad
spheres also exhibited more resistance to both paclitaxel
and doxorubicin than adherent HMLER-shEcad
cells (Supplementary Figure S1B). ALDH is used as
a biomarker to identify and characterize the BCSC
phenotype [24]. FACS data indicated a higher percentage
of ALDH+ cells in HMLER-shEcad spheres than that in

spheres was inhibited more potently than that of HMLE
spheres using the selected compounds (Figure 2B).
Considering the fact that NSC42199 (benztropine
mesylate, from NCI-DTP diversity Set II), Prestw-1013
(deptropine citrate) and Prestw-1236 (benztropine
mesylate from Prestwick library) were identified from two
different libraries, as well as their preferential inhibitory
effects on HMLER-shEcad spheres, we focused our
investigations on these compounds. We next investigated
their effects on the cell viability of spheres induced from
two other CSC-enriched breast cancer cell lines, namely
human MDA-MB-231 cells and murine 4T1-luc2 cells
[25, 26]. The IC50 values of benztropine mesylate and
deptropine citrate for MDA-MB-231 spheres were ~5
µM (Figure 2C). For 4T1-luc2 spheres, the IC50 value of
benztropine mesylate was around 5 µM (Supplementary
Figure S2).

effect on sphere formation by 5 µM benztropine mesylate
was maintained even in the quaternary spheres, suggesting
that treatment with benztropine mesylate reduced the stem
cell-like subpopulation, and thus prevented the recovery of
sphere formation (Figure 3C). A similar effect was seen for
the sphere formation of 4T1-luc2 cells after pretreatment
with the compounds (Figure 3D). Thus, the compounds
had an apparent effect on the self-renewal capability of
breast cancer cells, which persisted after drug withdrawal.
Salinomycin potently inhibited sphere formation of both
cell lines in all generations, whereas paclitaxel showed
inhibition in MDA-MB-231 cells but not in 4T1-luc2 cells.

Benztropine mesylate decreases the percentage
of breast cancer cells expressing CSC markers
In light of the above data, we focused further on the
anti-CSC properties of benztropine mesylate. To confirm
that benztropine mesylate targets the CSC subpopulation,
we analyzed the expression of the prospective BCSC
marker combination CD44+/CD24- and of ALDH after
benztropine mesylate treatment. Incubation with different
concentrations of benztropine mesylate resulted in a dosedependent reduction of the cell percentage with high
ALDH activity in MDA-MB-231 spheres, SKBR3 cells
and 4T1-luc2 cells (Figure 3E–3F and Supplementary
Figure S4). The proportion of ALDH+ cells was 11.1%
in the DMSO-treated group, and it decreased to 7.1, 5.5
and 4.9% after 6 days treatment with 1, 5 and 10 µM
benztropine mesylate, respectively (Figure 3E–3F). In
contrast, paclitaxel (10 nM) increased the percentage
of ALDH+ cells (Figure 3F; 16.8±1.28%, p<0.001).
The percentage of the CD44+/CD24- subpopulation was
significantly decreased when MDA-MB-231 spheres were
exposed to 5 µM (20.0±12.64%) and 10 µM benztropine
mesylate (13.3±13.36%) for 6 days, compared to DMSOtreated cells (46.5±3.30%, p<0.01, n=3) (Figure 3G–3H).
Salinomycin significantly reduced the CD44+/CD24subpopulation to 11.3% (±2.21%, p<0.001), whereas
paclitaxel had no influence on the percentage of the
CD44+/CD24- subpopulation in MDA-MB-231 spheres
(42.5±3.28%, p>0.05).

Deptropine citrate and benztropine mesylate
suppress mammosphere formation and selfrenewal capacities of BCSCs in vitro
The ability to form mammospheres is correlated
with the frequency of CSCs and progenitor cells in
tumor cell lines. Thus, we next analyzed the effects
of different concentrations of deptropine citrate and
benztropine mesylate on mammosphere formation of
MDA-MB-231 and 4T1-luc2 cells. Paclitaxel served
as a conventional chemotherapy drug control, whereas
salinomycin served as a positive control for selectively
targeting CSCs [13]. The mammosphere growth in SCM
with or without compounds was observed after 6 days. In
MDA-MB-231 cells, deptropine citrate and benztropine
mesylate reduced the size as well as the number of
mammospheres significantly in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S3A, p<0.001). In
4T1-luc2 cells, treatment with 5 or 10 µM, but not 1 µM,
of the compounds had a significant inhibitory effect on
the number and size of the mammospheres (Figure 3B
and Supplementary Figure S3B, p<0.001). In contrast,
paclitaxel had no major effect on the number of spheres in
both cell lines (Figure 3A–3B). The same effect was also
found in HMLER-shEcad (data not shown). The inhibitory
effects of different concentrations of the compounds on
sphere formation corresponded to their effects on cell
viability (Supplementary Figure S3C-D).
The ability of self-renewal is a unique characteristic
of stem cells. We tested the ability of MDA-MB-231
cells and 4T1-luc2 cells to form subsequent sphere
generations in suspension (without treatment) after a 4-day
pretreatment of the cells with the selected compounds
under adherent conditions. The sphere forming efficiency
of MDA-MB-231 cells in different generations was
markedly suppressed by pretreatment with 5 µM
deptropine citrate and benztropine mesylate, as compared
to DMSO (Figure 3C). Moreover, a significant inhibitory

Benztropine mesylate improves the efficiency of
chemotherapy in vitro
Accumulating evidence indicates that CSCs are
largely chemotherapy-resistant [3]. It has been proposed
that combined chemotherapy and anti-CSC treatment may
improve the efficacy of standard chemotherapy [2]. To
investigate this hypothesis, 1,000 4T1-luc2 cells or MDAMB-231 cells were grown in suspension with SCM in the
presence of 10 nM paclitaxel alone, 5 µM benztropine
mesylate alone or both drugs combined. After 6 days,
compared to DMSO (sphere number/well: 4T1-luc2
spheres: 50.0±6.45; MDA-MB-231 spheres: 55.3±6.83) or

histamine receptors

paclitaxel (4T1-luc2 spheres: 47.5±4.76; MDA-MB-231
spheres: 57.5±7.18), the combination treatment inhibited
the sphere formation significantly (4T1-luc2 spheres:
11.3±2.34; MDA-MB-231 spheres: 10.7±2.73; p<0.001).
Compared to benztropine mesylate alone (MDA-MB-231
spheres: 22.8±6.27), the combination treatment decreased
sphere formation efficiency by 53.1% in MDA-MB-231
spheres (p<0.05, Figure 4A-4B).
We next pretreated adherent 4T1-luc2 cells or MDAMB-231 cells with 10 nM paclitaxel alone or combined
with 5 µM benztropine mesylate for 4 days and performed
mammosphere formation assays. Compared to DMSO
(sphere number/well: 55.0±6.07) or paclitaxel (51.8±6.40)
alone, the combination treatment significantly reduced
the sphere formation of 4T1-luc2 cells (0.50±0.548),
which was more efficient than benztropine mesylate
alone (8.33±3.50, p<0.05). For MDA-MB-231 cells,
both benztropine mesylate alone (sphere number/well:
20.7±4.41) and the combination treatment (15.8±2.93)
impaired the sphere formation by >57%, compared to
DMSO (47.8±4.54) and paclitaxel alone (46.5±1.23,
p<0.001). There was no significant difference between
benztropine mesylate and combination treatment (Figure
4C–4D).

Benztropine mesylate is used clinically for
the management of Parkinson’s disease and its
pharmacological effects are thought to result from its
anticholinergic activity [27]. However, benztropine
mesylate is also a centrally acting anti-histamine [28] and
dopamine re-uptake inhibitor [29]. To determine which,
if any, of these activities play a role in the inhibition of
CSC properties, we evaluated the ability of selective
agonists of muscarinic acetycholine receptors (mAChRs),
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) (carbachol),
dopamine receptors (dopamine) or histaminergic receptors
(histamine) to reduce the inhibitory activity of benztropine
mesylate on mammosphere formation of BCSCs. The
benztropine mesylate-induced inhibition of mammosphere
formation in 4T1-luc2 cells was significantly reduced
in the presence of carbachol, histamine and dopamine,
as well as after combination treatment (Figure 5A–5C,
p<0.01). Carbachol and histamine also significantly
reduced the inhibitory effect of benztropine mesylate
on MDA-MB-231 sphere formation (Supplementary
Figure S6A-S6B, p<0.05). The combination treatment
with carbachol, histamine and dopamine partially but not
completely blocked the inhibitory effects of benztropine
mesylate on mammosphere formation of BCSCs.
We then evaluated a panel of antagonists for these
receptors, including the dopamine receptor antagonist
haloperidol, the histaminergic receptor antagonist
pyrilamine, and the acetylcholine receptor antagonists
atropine, hexamethonium bromide and pancuronium on
mammosphere formation of 4T1-luc2 cells (Figure 5D–5E
and Supplementary Figure S6C-S6E) and MDA-MB-231
cells (Supplementary Figure S6F-S6J). We found that 10
µM of haloperidol inhibited mammosphere formation of
4T1-luc2 cells. The mammosphere formation of MDAMB-231 cells was also significantly reduced when cells
were incubated with 10 nM of pyrilamine or different
doses of haloperidol (500 nM, 1 and 10 µM).
To further probe the potential mechanisms of action,
we applied the SPiDER protocol [30]. The software
successfully ranked known on- and off-targets of the
compound among the high confidence predictions (p<0.05,
Table S2). These results suggest that neurotransmitter
receptors may play important roles for the inhibitory
effects of benztropine on BCSCs (nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor agonist: p=0.005; muscarinic acetylcholine
receptor antagonist: p=0.023; histamine receptor: p=0.016;
dopamine receptor antagonist: p=0.03).
In a next step, we determined the mRNA expression
levels of distinct acetylcholine receptors in sphereforming and adherent HMLER shEcad, HMLER shCtrl

Benztropine mesylate inhibits tumor-initiating
potential in vivo
To test whether benztropine mesylate might
have any anti-CSC activity in vivo, we used the goldstandard assay for CSCs, the limiting dilution assay.
4T1 spheres were maintained in SCM and treated
with benztropine mesylate or DMSO in vitro for 6
days. Single cell suspensions isolated from pretreatedspheres were prepared and injected in serial limiting
dilutions (10 - 1,000 cells) into Balb/c mice, which
were monitored for subsequent tumor formation for
four weeks. We observed that benztropine mesylate
pretreatment resulted in a significant reduction in
the tumor-initiating potential relative to the DMSO
group (Table 1). We further performed an ELDA
(extreme limiting dilution assay) to evaluate the effect
of benztropine mesylate on the CSC frequency. The
repopulating frequency of CSCs was 1 of 218 for
benztropine mesylate treatment and 1 of 9 for DMSO
control in 4T1 cells. The difference in CSC frequency
between the two groups was significant (p<0.001,
Table 1). We next treated Balb/c mice bearing 4T1
breast tumors with benztropine mesylate (1.5 mg/kg)
or 0.9% saline for 3 weeks. Both tumor size and tumor
weight were significantly reduced after benztropine
mesylate treatment, as compared to the saline treated
control group (Supplementary Figure S5A-B). There
was no difference in body weight between the treatment
groups (Supplementary Figure S5C).

higher in sphere-forming HMLER shEcad cells than in
adherent HMLER shEcad cells (Supplementary Figure

expressed (126.8-fold) in HMLER shEcad spheres
than in immortalized, non-tumorigenic HMLE spheres

the two CSC enrichment methods and generated HMLERshEcad spheres. We found that HMLER-shEcad spheres
showed a higher population of slow-cycling cells, a higher
percentage of cells with high ALDH activity and increased
chemotherapy-resistance, compared with HMLER-shEcad
adherent cells. These results indicated that HMLERshEcad spheres contained a higher proportion of BCSCs.
Additionally, HMLER-shEcad cells cultured under
adherent conditions in differentiation medium showed a
cellular hierarchy with tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic
cells, which is an important character of CSCs. Based
on CD44 and CD24 expression profiles, distinct cell
populations of HMLER-shEcad cells were identified by
FACS (data not shown), and previous studies found that
the tumorigenic properties of distinct populations with
distinct CD44 and CD24 phenotypes were different [10].
Several investigators have aimed to identify
compounds that specifically inhibit the CSC-related
molecular properties or kill CSCs directly. For example,
Marx et al. screened the NCI-DTP diversity set II library
and identified four compounds capable of selective
silencing ErB2 transcription in breast cancer cells [32].
Three inhibitors (loxapine, pimozide and acacetin) of
the ABC transporters (ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2
transporters), which are highly expressed in chemoresistant
CSCs, were identified by high-throughput FACS screening
of the Prestwick library [33]. Sun et al. performed a cellbased screening using the Prestwick library to identify
potential inhibitors of survivin in prostate cancer cells;
survivin is a broadly expressed tumor antigen associated
with CSCs [34]. Because CSC populations are very
complex and multiple CSC pools exist within individual
tumors [35], we designed the screening platform based on
the function of CSCs, instead of just based on a single
CSC-related molecular property.
A major challenge for high-throughput screening is
to isolate and scale up sufficient amounts of CSCs. Other
CSC enrichment methods based on cell surface markers,
Hoechst dye exclusion, or cell auto-fluorescence, are
often time- and money-consuming. It is also unclear
whether any of these approaches can be used reliably and
routinely to enrich CSCs across all subtypes. The spheroid

DISCUSSION
The existence of CSCs has been reported across
a range of hematological as well as solid malignancies,
and these cells display the capacity for self-renewal and
differentiation, which are critical for tumor initiation,
progression, metastasis and recurrence [31]. The CSC
model not only provides an explanation for the failure
of conventional cancer therapies that target proliferating
tumor cells, but also provides an important drug target in
cancer [3, 4, 8]. Identification of agents that selectively
inhibit the traits of BCSCs has therefore become a key
goal in the challenge to improve the efficacy of cancer
therapy.
In the present study, we screened two small
molecule libraries by using a 96-well plate spheroidderived CSC growth assay. We used HMLER-shEcad
spheres as a model for CSCs. It has been previously
shown that HMLER-shEcad cells are enriched with EMTinduced CSCs. These cells are transformed to have a
mesenchymal phenotype (a hallmark of CSCs) by downregulation of E-cadherin, producing a high percentage of
a CD44+/CD24- population [19]. Dontu et al. indicated
that suspension mammospheres are enriched in early
progenitor/stem cells and are able to differentiate and
generate complex functional structures in a reconstituted
3D-culture system with SCM [18]. Our study combined

technique used here allows the production of large
amounts of CSCs and therefore enables the availability of
these cells for screening. Additionally, this assay allows
the exclusion of compounds that inhibit not only CSCs,
but also NSCs, since NSCs share many properties with

CSCs. In fact, salinomycin was found to inhibit BCSC
properties but it also exhibited equal toxicity to NSCs
in vitro, with potential implications for its safety profile
[36]. To validate the selectivity of candidate compounds
for CSCs, we used HMLE adherent cells and spheres as

controls, which contain distinctive and discrete naturally
present subpopulations of stem-like and non-stem-like
cells [19, 37]. Both HMLE adherent cells and spheres
control conditions were used to eliminate compounds
with general toxicity for normal breast cells and stem
cell-like cells as well as to eliminate the compounds with
inhibitory effects due to the suspension culture system. In
summary, this model provides a convenient strategy for
compound screening, but there are also some limitations:
As the model is a specialized screening system and does
not represent a specific type of breast cancer, further
functional assays using defined human or mouse breast
cancer cell lines are needed for confirmation of the
screening results.
We used a small-molecule collection consisting of
2,546 compounds from two chemical libraries including
the NCI-DTP diversity set II and the Prestwick library
for screening. The NCI-DTP diversity set II is an
uncharacterized compound library, which provides the
possibility of identifying novel lead candidates, with the
drawback that the active mechanisms of these compounds
are largely unknown. In contrast, the compounds from
the Prestwick library are already FDA-approved, wellcharacterized drugs, which may render the translation
of discoveries from the basic laboratory to the clinical
application more easily. Also, the already known
mechanisms of action of the potential hit compounds may
provide some hints for the exploration of the mechanism
of their new function.
Based on this robust cell-based screening method,
we identified nineteen compounds, including three groups
of compounds with related chemical core structures,
preferentially targeting the viability of HMLER-shEcad
spheres but not HMLE adherent cells and spheres.
We focused on characterizing the anti-CSC properties
of the compounds deptropine citrate and benztropine
mesylate, which have the same chemical core structure.
Deptropine citrate, a well-known H1-histamine receptor
antagonist and muscarinic receptor antagonist, showed
inhibitory effects on cell viability and mammosphere
formation of BCSCs, but it did not inhibit the self-renewal
capacities of MDA-MB-231 cells. Benztropine mesylate
significantly inhibited mammosphere formation and selfrenewal of BCSCs. It also decreased the ALDH+ and
CD44+/CD24- CSC subpopulations. Previous studies
showed that these markers both enrich for stem cells,
however the populations do not appear to correlate
highly with each other [38, 39]. Our results indicated that
benztropine mesylate could inhibit CSCs with distinct
phenotype. Additionally, our in vivo studies revealed
that benztropine mesylate inhibited the tumor-initiating
potential significantly and decreased the CSC frequency.
Thus, benztropine mesylate is a potential anti-CSC drug
candidate that can alter tumorigenic properties. However,
considering the complexity and heterogeneity of human
cancers, many preclinical animal models fail to predict
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the clinical efficacy of novel anti-cancer agents. Further
functional research studies using humanized mouse
models, such as patient-derived xenograft models [40]
or mice with humanized immune system or mammary
microenvironment [41] would be helpful to support a
potential clinical translation.
Benztropine mesylate is a centrally acting
anticholinergic agent for the treatment of Parkinson’s
disease [27]. In a multiple sclerosis mouse model,
benztropine mesylate induced the differentiation of
oligodendrocytes through M1 and M3 muscarinic
receptors and enhanced re-myelination [42]. Benztropine
mesylate also acts as an anti-histamine [28] and a
dopamine re-uptake inhibitor [29], and as an allosteric
antagonist of the human D2 dopamine receptor
(Pubchem BioAssay: AID 485344). In the present study,
the pharmacological data indicated that benztropine
mesylate partially inhibited the BCSC properties through
acetylcholine receptors, dopamine receptors/transporters
and/or histamine receptors, even though more detailed
follow-up studies might be needed to investigate the
relative contribution of these pathways. A previous study
reported that thioridazine, an antagonist of the dopamine
receptor, impairs human somatic CSCs capable of in vivo
leukemic disease initiation by inducing differentiation to
overcome neoplastic self-renewal, while having no effect
on normal blood stem cells [43]. Haloperidol, which
exhibits high affinity dopamine D2 receptor antagonism
and slows receptor dissociation kinetics [44], inhibited
mammosphere formation of BCSCs markedly in our study.
Thus, our findings further indicate that dopamine receptors
play an important role in mediating BCSC functions, and
indicate that dopamine receptors might represent potential
CSC markers in breast cancer. Further investigation is
required to better understand the connection of dopamine
receptor signaling and CSC biology in human cancers.
The comparison of acetylcholine receptor expression
levels indicates that CSCs have increased acetylcholine
receptor expression levels, rendering them more sensitive
to inhibition by benztropine mesylate. Future studies are
needed to dissect the specific role of α9-nAChR for the
biological properties of CSCs.
Other, yet unidentified pathways might also be
involved in the anti-CSC effects of benztropine mesylate.
A preliminary analysis of the topological pharmacophore
feature pattern (CATS2 descriptor) [45] of benztropine
mesylate suggested potential activity as a CCR5
antagonist. Increasing evidence indicates that CCL5 and
CCR5 are overexpressed in breast cancer, and CCR5
antagonists block metastasis of breast cancer [46, 47].
However, in the DRUGMATRIX screen (https://ntp.niehs.
nih.gov/drugmatrix), benztropine mesylate was reported to
not posses a high-affinity effect on CCR5 (<50% inhibition
at 10 μM ligand concentration). The algorithm analysis
by SPIDER software suggested that the compound could
be modulating the Akt or Wnt pathways (through Akt or
1017

Chemical libraries and reagents

Casein Kinase 1 binding, p=0.04, Table S2), which are
associated with BCSCs [48–50]. This theoretical analysis
points to motivated macromolecular targets of benztropine
mesylate in the context of cancer, which deserve further
attention.

Two
commercially
available
chemical
libraries, the Prestwick chemical library (http://www.
prestwickchemical.com/) and the NCI-DTP diversity Set II
https://dtp.cancer.gov/databases_tools/data_search.htm
were used. Compounds were solubilized at 1 mM in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and all compounds were
diluted in assay media for a final concentration of 10 μM
in the screen. The concentration of DMSO in each assay
well, including all control wells was 1%. NSC42199 was
kindly provided by the NCI/NIH, while Prestw-1013 and
Prestw-1236 were purchased from Prestwick Chemical
Inc. All other compounds used in in vitro assays were
bought from Sigma and dissolved in DMSO.

CONCLUSIONS
Selective targeting of CSCs offers promise for a
new generation of cancer therapeutics. In this study, we
developed a cell-based phenotypic screening platform for
the identification of CSC-specific inhibitors that have only
minor effects on normal stem cells. Benztropine mesylate
was identified as a novel potential anti-CSC inhibitor
by in vitro and in vivo assays, thus revealing a novel
usage for a known drug that could be readily translated
to further preclinical and clinical development. The
screening platform established here could also be applied
for larger-scale screens for the identification of anti-CSC
compounds.

Chemical screening and data analysis
The chemical screening was performed in a 96well plate format. 1,000 cells isolated from HMLE and
HMLER-shEcad cells were inoculated in a mixed medium
of MEGM and DMEM at adherent conditions, while
3,000 sphere-forming cells isolated from related spheres
were grown in SCM as suspension. After 24 h, cells were
treated with compounds from the chemical libraries at
10 µM or DMSO only. Cell viability was determined
by the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay after 72 h
treatment according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The optical density (OD) at 450 nm was measured by a
microplate reader (Tecan Inc). The cell viability fraction
(%) was calculated as follows: OD450nm-test compound /
OD450nm-DMSO × 100%. The screening was done for two
independent replicates and the quality of the experiments
was determined by principal component analysis and
calculation of the Pearson correlation coefficients (r) of
biological replicates using Prism 5.0.

METHODS
Cell lines, monolayer and mammosphere culture
HMLE and HMLER-shEcad cell lines were kindly
provided by Dr. Robert Weinberg (MIT, Cambridge, MA,
USA) on October 18, 2011, and were cultured as described
[13, 51]. The cells were not authenticated afterwards. The
MDA-MB-231 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Nancy
E. Hynes, FMI, Basel, Switzerland on July 24, 2011,
and tested negative for mycoplasma with MycoProbe
(R&D Systems). Cell line authentication was confirmed
by short tandem repeat analysis on November 29, 2013,
at Microsynth AG to match the fingerprint of the ATCC
corresponding cell line. The 4T1-luc2 cell line was
purchased from Calliper Life Science (Waltham, MA)
on November 18, 2008, and no further authentication
was done. Both cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) and 1% (v/v) antibioticantimycotic solution.
Mammospheres were generated by incubating single
cell suspensions in serum-free stem cell medium (SCM)
containing Mammary Epithelial Cell Growth Medium
(MEGM, Lonza, for HMLE and HMLER-shEcad spheres)
or Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture
F-12 (DMEM/F12, Gibco, for MDA-MB-231 and 4T1luc2 spheres) supplemented with 2% (v/v) B27 (Gibco),
20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF, Peprotech Inc.),
20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, Peprotech
Inc.), 10 µg/ml insulin, 20 µg/ml hydrocortisone (SigmaAldrich) and antibiotic-antimycotic solution as described
[13, 51] in flasks coated with poly (2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate) (poly-HEMA, Polysciences Inc.) solution.
The spheres were passaged every 7-9 days.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Chemotherapy sensitivity assays
1,000 cells were seeded in 96-well plates, and
various concentrations of paclitaxel or doxorubicin were
added after 24 h, and co-incubated for 72 h. The cell
viability was measured using the CCK-8 assay.

Flow cytometry (FACS) analysis for CD44 and
CD24
All antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences
(San Diego, CA, USA). Combinations of fluorochromeconjugated monoclonal antibodies against human CD44
(APC; cat. # 559942) and CD24 (PE; cat. # 555428) or
their respective isotype controls (APC mouse IgG2b,κ: cat.
#555745; PE mouse IgG2a,κ: cat. #555574) were added to
single cell suspensions of MDA-MB-231 spheres at 1:20
and incubated at 4°C for 30 min. The labeled cells were
washed in FACS buffer (2 mM EDTA, 1% (w/v) BSA in
PBS) twice, and then acquired with a FACS Canto (BD
1018

Biosciences). Data were analyzed with Flow Jo software
(FlowJo X 10.0.7) and illustrated as percentage of cells
with a CD44+/CD24- phenotype±SD.

Biosystems 7900HT fast real-time PCR machine. qRTPCR reactions were carried out with SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and ATCB (β-actin)
levels were used as controls. The mean cycle threshold
value (Ct), normalized to the Ct value of the housekeeping
gene (ATCB) was used to calculate gene expression
values. Primers for human genes were custom-made
oligonucleotide primers (Microsynth, Switzerland). Primer
sequences are shown in Table S1. Data are given as 2−ΔΔCt.

Aldefluor assay
The
ALDEFLUOR
assay
(STEMCELL
Technologies) was used to profile stem and progenitor cells
based on their high expression of ALDH1. The Aldefluor
assay was conducted according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, single cell suspensions from treated
or untreated tumor cells were harvested, washed with
Aldefluor assay buffer, the cell density was adjusted to 106
cells/ml in Aldefluor assay buffer supplement with ALDH
substrate and cells were incubated for 40 min at 37°C to
allow substrate conversion. As a negative control for all
experiments, an aliquot of Aldefluor-stained cells was
immediately quenched with diethylaminobenzaldehyde
(DEAB), a specific ALDH inhibitor. Cells were analyzed
using the FITC channel on the FACS Canto. Data were
analyzed with FlowJo software. The ALDH+ fraction was
calculated based on the disappearance of that fraction in
the presence of DEAB using the formula: ALDH+ fraction
= ALDH+ percentage(-DEAB) - ALDH+ percentage(+DEAB)

In vivo liming dilution assay
Animal studies were carried out according to the
ethical guidelines established by our Institution (ETH
Zürich), under approved animal protocols (11/2012 and
12/2015) by the Veterinäramt des Kantons Zürich. Mice
were housed in microisolator cages and in pathogen free
conditions. Surgical procedures were performed under
anesthesia and all efforts were made to minimize suffering
of the animals. 4T1-luc2 spheres were maintained in
ultra-low attachment plates with SCM and pretreated
for 6 days with benztropine mesylate (5 μM) or DMSO
(0.1%) in vitro. Single cells were injected in 50 μl 1:1
matrigel:DMEM/F12 solution into the fourth mammary fat
pad of 8-week old female Balb/c mice (Janvier) at varying
cell numbers ranging from 10 to 1,000 cells/mouse. The
tumor-initiating frequency, determined four weeks after
injection, was used for calculation of frequency of BCSCs
using the extreme limiting dilution assay (ELDA) webtool
(http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda) as described
previously [52].

Mammosphere formation assay
Mammosphere formation assays were performed
as described, but with addition of 0.5% methylcellulose
to prevent cell aggregation [18]. 1,000 cells were seeded
per well in ultra-low attachment 96-well plates with SCM.
After incubation with test compounds for 6 days, the
mammosphere numbers (diameter > 50 μm) were counted
and photographed.

Statistics
Data are represented as mean±SD. Statistical
tests were performed with GraphPad Prism V5.0 (San
Diego, CA). A two-tailed Student’s t-test was used for
comparisons of continuous variables between two groups.
One-way ANOVA with Tukey or Dunnett post tests or
two-way ANOVA was used when three or more groups
were compared.

Self-renewal assay
Adherent cells were pretreated with compounds or
0.1% DMSO for 4 days. 1,000 cells were dissociated and
seeded in ultra-low attachment 96-well plates with 100 µl
of SCM. Cells were seeded in parallel at the same density
in 6-well plates. 6 days later, the primary mammospheres
formed in 96-well plates were counted and photographed.
The cells in 6-well plates were dissociated into single
cells and seeded as next generation of mammospheres
in both 96-well and 6-well plates without treatment.
The mammosphere number was measured in different
generations of spheres without treatment.
