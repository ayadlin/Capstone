Abstract:

A delicate balance between estrogen and progestagen signaling underlies proper
functioning of the female reproductive tract and, in particular, the monthly re- and
degenerative phases characteristic of the menstrual cycle. Here, we propose that the
canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway may underlie this finely tuned hormonal
equilibrium in endometrial homeostasis and, upon its constitutive activation,
lead to neoplastic transformation of the endometrium. During the menstrual
cycle, estradiol will enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the proliferative phase,
while progesterone inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling, thus restraining estrogens’
proliferative actions, during the secretory phase. In case of enhanced or unopposed
estrogen signaling, constitutive activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling will trigger
endometrial hyperplasia, which may develop further into endometrial cancer.

Sex hormone signaling in the
endometrium

(e.g. insulin like growth factor; IGF-1), that stimulate
endometrial proliferation [4]. Later, during the third and
fourth week of the menstrual cycle, the corpus luteum
starts producing progesterone thus inhibiting estradiolinduced proliferation of endometrial cells and stimulating
cellular differentiation [5] [6]. If no fertilized oocytes
are implanted in the uterus, the corpus luteum cannot be
maintained due to lack of human chorion gonadotropine
(HCG), and both estrogen and progesterone levels will
decline. Withdrawal of progesterone leads to endometrial
cell apoptosis and tissue breakdown of the functionalis of
the endometrium, resulting in its shedding from the uterus
[7].
The inhibition of estrogens’ mitotic activity exerted
by progesterone is of clinical relevance as unopposed or
increased estrogen action in women is a well-established
risk factor for endometrial cancer [8] [9].

The inner layer of the human uterus, the endometrium
is a dynamic tissue that undergoes hundreds of cycles
of proliferation, differentiation and shedding during a
woman’s reproductive years [1]. The endometrium can be
divided into two layers, the functionalis and the basalis.
Whereas the functionalis layer comprises the upper
two-thirds of the endometrium and is shedded during
menstruation, the basalis includes the lower one-third
which remains intact and is responsible for producing a
new functionalis during each subsequent menstrual cycle
[1] [2].
It is the fine balance between the activities of the
two female sex hormones, estradiol and progesterone,
which determines lineage faith in the endometrium.
During the first two weeks of the menstrual cycle the
thecal cells of the ovary produce large amounts of
estradiol. Simultaneously, endometrial estrogen receptor
(ER) levels (mainly ERα) are increased [3]. Upon ligand
binding, ER dimers will translocate to the nucleus where
they activate transcription of downstream target genes

Unbalanced sex hormone signaling can induce
endometrial cancer
Endometrial cancer is one of the most common
cancers of the female genital tract [10]. It accounts each

year for approximately 142.000 new cases diagnosed
worldwide, and for 42.000 deaths [11] [12]. Endometrial
cancer is the seventh most common malignant disorder
and its incidence is expected to increase in the near future
due to the increase in life span expectancy and obesity
[13].
Based on epidemiology, conventional histopathology,
and clinical behavior, endometrial carcinoma can be
divided into two subtypes. Type I endometrial cancer,
comprising approximately 85% of the total endometrial
carcinoma burden among western societies, resembles
normal endometrial hyperplasia in morphology and is
associated with increased or unopposed estrogen signaling
[12]. Type I endometrial cancer often shows mutations in
the PTEN and in DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1,
MSH2, MSH6). Also, oncogenic mutations in KRAS and/
or CTNNB1 (β-catenin) are recognized major alterations

[14] [15] [16]. Type II endometrial cancer occurs
predominantly in older post-menopausal women, is not
correlated to increased estrogen exposure, and is generally
associated with a poorer prognosis. Type II endometrial
cancers often show mutations in TP53 and ERBB2 (Her-2/
neu) [12] [15] [16].
In western, industrialized countries, two large groups
of women are at increased risk of developing endometrial
cancer: (i) women with significant overweight [13], and
(ii) those receiving tamoxifen for breast cancer treatment
[17]. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator
(SERM) acting as an antiestrogen in mammary tissue, but
showing estrogenic activity in the endometrium [18].
Currently, it is estimated that up to 40% of all endometrial
cancers could be related to obesity [13]. Since the
prevalence of obesity is increasing, the incidence of
obesity-related endometrial cancer is also on the rise [19].

endometrial gene expression profiles from postmenopausal women after no treatment (C), 21-day treatment with estradiol (E), or estradiol +
medroxyprogesterone acetate (E+P) [22], with gene expression profiles from the proliferative endometrium (PE), early secretory endometrium
(ESE), mid secretory endometrium (MSE), or late secretory endometrium (LSE) [4]. The bars represent the relative expression levels of the
indicated genes under the indicated conditions. For this figure the twenty most significantly estrogen regulated genes are shown. The three

also behave differently during the menstrual cycle: IGF1
and IGFB5 are upregulated during the proliferative, early
and mid secretory phases of the menstrual cycle, whereas
SCGB1D2 is upregulated exclusively during the early and
mid secretory phases (Fig. 1).
Next to gene profiling studies, immunohistochemical
analysis of PRA/PRB and ERα expression were performed
together with measurements of estrogen availability [21].
These investigations revealed that besides a small increase
in PRA/PRB levels in glandular cells upon treatment
with E-only, no pronounced differences in ERα and PR
expression levels were observed between the E-only and
the E+P group [21]. Furthermore, in order to fully asses
estrogen signaling, next to the biologically most potent
estrogen, estradiol (E2), the less active estradiol precursor,
estrone (E1), as well as its inactivated form, sulfated
estrone (E1S), were measured [28] [31] [32]. It was
observed that both in sera and in uterine tissues, estradiol,
estrone and sulfated estrone were increased as a result
of E-only and E+P treatment, though with no significant
difference between the treatment groups [32] These
studies seem to indicate that progestagenic regulation of
estrogen signaling at the receptor level and at the level
of ligand availability is not the major mechanism through
which progesterone counterbalances estrogen signaling
during the menstrual cycle, and additional molecular
mechanisms are likely to play a role.
In literature there are a number of reports implicating
an important role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in regulating
endometrial proliferation and differentiation. For example,
the activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling was observed
to change between different stages of the menstrual
cycle [33] and plays an important role in preparing
the endometrium for embryo implantation [34] and
subsequent placental formation [35]. Furthermore, Wnt/βcatenin signaling is often found activated in endometrial
cancer [14] [36] and, upon reviewing regulation of
estrogen and progesterone regulated genes [21] [22]
[4], it was also observed that a significant number of
downstream targets and components of the Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway were regulated [37]. Moreover, some
of the sex hormone-regulated downstream targets and
components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway have
also been implicated in endometrial carcinogenesis: both
FOXO1 and CDH1 (E-cadherin) expression is decreased
in endometrial cancer and is induced by progesterone [38]
[39] while Survivin (BIRC5) is expressed at high levels
in endometrial cancer and upregulated by estradiol [40].
Based on these observations, a role for Wnt/β-catenin
signaling downstream from sex hormone signaling in the
endometrium was hypothesized and will be discussed in
more detail in the next paragraphs.

Additional risk factors for the development of endometrial
cancer include: polycystic ovarian syndrome, skipping
menstrual periods, being nulliparous, late menopause
onset, and the use of unopposed estrogen as hormone
substitution therapy [20]. Hence, enhanced estrogen
signaling for prolonged periods of time, also as the result
of insufficient progesterone levels, represents the main
risk factor in endometrial cancer.
Progesterone antagonizes the proliferative activity
of estrogen by inducing epithelial and stromal cell
differentiation in the endometrium [21] [22]. In fact,
although progesterone (in the form of medroxyprogesterone
acetate (MPA)) can be used for the palliative treatment
of well-advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer, this
treatment has a modest response rate (15-25%) [23]. In
contrast, when progesterone, is employed as a primary
treatment (e.g. in pre-menopausal women suffering from
well-differentiated endometrial cancer and determined
to preserve fertility), response rates are considerably
improved (up to 60% or more) [24] [25].

The mechanisms by which progesterone induces
its anti-proliferative effect on the endometrium are still
largely unknown. Several studies have shown a direct
effect of progesterone on estrogen receptor signaling
and expression levels [26], while others show that
progesterone affects the availability of bioactive estrogens
[27] [28] [29]. Furthermore, differential expression of the
progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms (PRA and PRB)
and the relative expression levels of ERα compared to
ERβ could also play a role in controlling endometrial
proliferation during the menstrual cycle [30] [27].
In order to investigate in more detail the molecular
mechanism(s) underlying progesterone-driven inhibition
of estrogen signaling, expression profiling analysis was
conducted on endometrial tissue specimens obtained
from postmenopausal women treated for three weeks
with estrogens (E-only) or estrogens+progestagens
(E+P) and compared to untreated controls [21] [22].
The endometrial gene profiles obtained from this study
were also compared with endometrial gene expression
levels of untreated women during the different stages
of the menstrual cycle [4]. Upon reviewing regulation
of expression of the twenty most significantly estrogenregulated genes (Fig. 1), it was observed that most of
them were completely counterbalanced by concurrent
administration of progestagens (E+P). However, estrogeninduced upregulation of specific genes (e.g. IGF1 and
IGFBP5) is only partly counterbalanced by progestagens,
whereas in other cases (e.g. SCGB1D2) the increase of
expression level upon estrogen signaling is not at all
counterbalanced by progestagens. Notably, these genes

the cell membrane during the secretory phase. Recently,
it was also observed that estradiol induces stabilization
of intracellular β-catenin in the endometrium, and, upon
inhibition of Wnt signaling (by using adenoviral SFRP2),
estradiol-induced proliferation was abolished [50]. In two
other studies [51] [52], LiCl was administered through
the drinking water of mice to inhibit GSK3β activity and
thereby activate Wnt signaling. LiCl-treated animals were
characterized by increased proliferation and hyperplasia
of the endometrium, thus mimicking sustained estrogen
signaling.
In summary, it seems likely that, during the menstrual
cycle, sex hormones can modulate Wnt/β-catenin
signaling to maintain the balance between proliferation
and differentiation.

Central in canonical Wnt signaling is the destruction
complex, a multi-protein complex consisting of the scaffold
proteins AXIN1 and AXIN2 (conductin), β-catenin
(CTNNB1), the tumor suppressor APC (adenomatosis
polyposis coli) and the Ser-Thr kinases CK1 (casein kinase
I) and GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta) [41]. In
the absence of Wnt ligands, formation of the destruction
complex triggers Thr/Ser-phosphorylation of β-catenin
by CK1 and GSK3β, and its subsequent ubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation. Upon Wnt signaling, the
formation of the destruction complex is inhibited thus
leading to cytoplasmic accumulation of β-catenin and its
nuclear translocation [42]. Once in the nucleus, β-catenin
interacts with members of the TCF/LEF transcription
factor family, thus regulating the expression of a broad
spectrum of Wnt downstream target genes [42] [43]
[44]. The latter include genes encoding for proteins with
a central role in cell proliferation and survival such as
cyclin D1 (CCND1) and c-MYC, in addition to a broad
spectrum of other cellular functions i.e. cellular migration
(e.g. CD44), cell adhesion (CDH1), extracellular matrix
(MMP7) and many others [42] [45].
The central role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the
regulation of tissue homeostasis has been extensively
investigated for the gut [42] [46]. Along the intestinal
tract, stem cells are located at the bottom of the crypts
of Lieberkuhn where they give rise to new stem cells and
to proliferating progenitor cells (transient amplifying,
TA, cells) [47]. These progenitor cells actively divide and
produce new cells that are pushed up along the flank of
the crypt towards the villus and eventually differentiate
into Goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells and absorptive
epithelial cells [48]. A somewhat similar process seems
to take place in the endometrium, where estrogen receptor
activation in the basalis stimulates endometrial cell
proliferation during the first two weeks of the menstrual
cycle, thus giving rise to the functionalis. In week three
and four of the menstrual cycle, the corpus luteum will
produce progesterone, which reduces estrogens-driven
proliferation and induces differentiation of the functionalis
thus preparing the endometrium for implantation of the
fertilized oocyte around day 20 - 22 of the menstrual cycle.
Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity along the crypt-villus
axis of the intestine follows a decreasing gradient from the
stem cell (SC) and proliferative (TA) compartment to the
more differentiated compartment [49]. In the endometrium
Wnt/β-catenin signaling has also been suggested to play a
role in regulating proliferation and differentiation during
the menstrual cycle. Nei et al. [33] observed that in the
human endometrium, nuclear β-catenin was clearly
enhanced during the proliferative phase of the menstrual
cycle, while it was mostly found in the cytoplasm and at
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Estradiol regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
The putative mechanisms underlying estrogenmediated Wnt/β-catenin activation in the uterus are
at present poorly understood. A direct effect of ERα as
a transcription factor on the expression of Wnt ligands,
modulators and targets has been described by many
authors: the ligands Wnt4, Wnt5A and Wnt7A have been
shown to be induced by estradiol [53] [54] [50] [55] [56];
the Wnt inhibitor DKK1 was shown to be inhibited by
estrogens in bone forming osteoblasts [57] and in the
hippocampal CA1 region [58] and last, the Wnt-target
gene WISP2 (Wnt-1 induced signaling pathway protein 2)
was shown to be upregulated through direct interaction of
activated ERα with its promoter region in human breast
cancer cells [59].
ERα, however, can also function as a transcriptional
modulator without directly binding to DNA sequences in
the promoter region of the affected genes. For example,
Shi et al [60] could show that EZH2 (the polycomb group
protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2) physically interacts
with ERα and β-catenin. Hence, estradiol can affect
the transcription of Wnt/β-catenin target genes without
directly interacting with estrogen response elements at the
DNA level.
Furthermore, ERα has also been observed to
associate with important growth factor pathways such
as the PI3K pathway thus indirectly cross-talking with
canonical Wnt signaling [61] [62]. Binding of ERα to
p85 (PIK3R2), the regulatory subunit of PI3K, activates
AKT1 which results in inhibition of GSK-3β. This, in
turn, prevents N-terminal Ser/Thr phosphorylation of
β-catenin, enhances its intracellular stabilization and
eventual allowes for translocation to the nucleus, where
it complexes with members of the TCF/LEF transcription
factor family and lead to the activation of Wnt target genes
[63] [64] (Fig. 2A and Fig 3).

efficiently inhibited the expression of a Wnt/β-catenin
signaling reporter plasmid (TOP/FOPflash) in the
Ishikawa endometrial cancer cell line by induction of the
Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors DKK1 [66] and FOXO1 [38].
Furthermore, when induction of both DKK1 and FOXO1
was prevented, progesterone inhibition of Wnt signaling
was also partly circumvented. FOXO1, in this respect, is
an interesting molecule, as it has been shown to physically
interact with the progesterone receptor to coordinate cell
cycle regulation and differentiation of human endometrial
stromal cells [69]. Furthermore, FOXO1 is also able to
interact with β-catenin [70] [71], thus possibly directly
inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling [72].
Another pathway likely to play a role in regulating
the interplay between progesterone and Wnt/β-catenin
signaling is Hedgehog (Hh). Combined endometrial
microarray data from different stages of the menstrual
cycle [4] and from E-only or E+P treated patients [22]
indicated profound sex hormone regulation of Hh
signaling. The Hedgehog ligand IHH (Indian hedgehog),
its receptor PTCH, and the transcription factor and target
gene GLI1 are all up-regulated upon estrogen signaling
and downregulated by progesterone during the menstrual
cycle. Furthermore, it has been shown that when IHH
expression is impaired, the downstream effects of
progesterone are lost in the uterus [73]. As indicated,
progesterone itself downregulates Hh signaling in the
uterus and it has been shown that Wnt/β-catenin signaling
may act downstream to Indian hedgehog signaling [74].
Recently the link between Hedgehog and Wnt/βcatenin signaling has also been confirmed for atypical
endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer: in
hyperplasia and in well differentiated endometrial cancers
GLI1 overexpression overlaps with β-catenin nuclear
immunoreactivity [75]. Because our own data on staining
for the Wnt target gene CD44 indicated that progesterone
can also act as a profound inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin
signaling in vivo in hyperplasia as well as in well
differentiated endometrial cancer, a physiological and
functional link between progesterone, hedgehog and Wnt/
β-catenin signaling seems plausible. (Fig. 2B and Fig. 3)

A role for progesterone in regulating Wnt/β-catenin
signaling was suggested by Kao et al. [65] and by Tulac
et al. [66] who observed a profound progesterone-specific
increase in expression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
inhibitor DKK1 in endometrial stroma cells during
the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. Using the
antiprogestagen mefipristone (RU486), Catalano et al.
[67] could indeed confirm progestagen regulation of many
Wnt/β-catenin pathway components. Furthermore, Kane
at al. [68] subsequently showed that TGFβ1 attenuates
both the expression of PR and DKK1 in differentiated
endometrial stromal cells corroborating a close link
between progesterone and Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
Recently, our group has followed up on these
observations [37] and could show that progesterone

Gene mutations leading to constitutive activation
of canonical Wnt signaling have been found in many
different cancer types (e.g. breast, colon, stomach, liver,
ovary skin etc). Also in the case of endometrial cancer,
activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is likely to play
an important role in early tumorigenesis [14] [36]. A
substantial fraction of well differentiated endometriod
carcinomas (Type I) cases (31%: [76]; 85%: [77])
show nuclear β-catenin staining (Fig. 4). Accordingly,

the effects of conditional Wnt signaling activation in the
uterus by Amhr2-Cre-driven oncogenic activation of
β-catenin (Ctnnb1tm1Mmt/+). The Amhr2 gene is expressed
as of embryonic day 12.5 onwards in mesenchymal cells
surrounding the Mullerian duct and in adult mice in the
myometrium. The corresponding Amhr2Cre/+;Ctnnb1tm1Mmt/+
mice develop myometrial hyperplasia and mesenchymal
tumors (similar to leiomyomas) and endometrial
sarcomas. Furthermore, hyperplasia of endometrial glands
was occasionally observed in the uterus, suggesting that
mesenchymal activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays
a role in the early events of epithelial tumorigenesis in the
endometrium. Jeong et al. [84] employed Pgr-Cre to drive
oncogenic activation of β-catenin (PgrCre/+;Ctnnb1f(Ex3)/+)
and of canonical Wnt signaling in a broad spectrum of
uterine cells (endometrium + myometrium). These authors
could show that activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in
the uterus resulted in enhanced proliferation of glandular
epithelial cells, endometrial hyperplasia at 6 weeks of
age, and in defective estrogen signaling, though not in
endometrial cancer. These results suggest that constitutive
activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling on its own is
insufficient for endometrial cancer onset and possibly
that the synergistic action of additional downstream
effectors of estrogen signaling are necessary for fullblown malignant transformation. However, as predicted
by the ”just-right” signaling model [85] [86], different
levels of pathway activation may differently trigger
tumorigenesis in distinct tissues. Therefore, it would be of
interest to investigate the consequences of hypomorphic
mutations in members of the Wnt pathway other than
β-catenin whose oncogenic activation invariably leads
to extremely high Wnt signaling levels. By inducing Apc
mutations in the myometrium [87], we recently observed
defects in the myometrial layer of the uterus, where a
significant loss of muscle fibers was apparent [Wang et al,
submitted). Likewise, we also employed Pgr-Cre to drive
loss of Apc function in epithelial cells of the endometrium
and in myometrial cells. Also in this case, muscular
defects were apparent with invasion of endometrial
glands and stroma into the muscular layer. Notably, we
also observed hyperplasia and early stage endometrial
cancer [manuscript in preparation). Hence, it is possible

suppressors (APC) and oncogenes (β-catenin) have also
been identified. β-catenin activating mutations at its GSK3β binding consensus site located within exon 3 have
been identified in 15-40 % of endometrial tumors [78]
[79], whereas LOH at the APC locus was observed in 24
% of the cases with nuclear β-catenin staining [80]. APC
mutation analysis showed truncating mutations in 10%
of all endometrial cancers [81]. Moreover, the APC A1
promoter was found to be hypermethylated in 46.6% of
endometrial cancers with nuclear β-catenin [80], often in
correlation with micro-satellite instability [82]. Notably,
these somatic mutations in members of the canonical Wnt
pathway were preferentially found in Type I endometrial
cancer, which accounts for about 85% of the total number
of endometrial cancer cases. Enhanced estrogen signaling
over a prolonged period of time is believed to be a causative
factor for Type I endometrial cancer [9]. Hence, although
continuous estrogen induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling
may represent an early step in endometrial tumorigenesis,
tumor progression and malignant transformation seem
to additionally require somatic mutations leading to the
constitutive activation of the pathway (Fig. 3).

Current investigations into the role of Wnt/βcatenin signaling in endometrial carcinogenesis.
Enhanced or unopposed estrogen signaling is the
most important risk factor for endometrial hyperplasia and
endometrial cancer. In view of the observations according
to which i. Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a central role
in endometrial homeostasis, ii. it possibly represents
one of the downstream effectors of estrogen signaling,
and iii. its constitutive activation is likely to underlie
malignant transformation in the uterus, it is important
to assess whether canonical Wnt can trigger endometrial
hyperplasia and cancer in the absence of enhanced
estrogen signaling. In other words, among the allegedly
broad spectrum of downstream effectors of estrogen
signaling, does constitutive Wnt/β-catenin activation play
a rate-limiting role for endometrial malignancies?
Fig.4To this aim, several genetically engineered mouse
models have been employed. Tanwar et al. [83] investigated

a dosage- and context-dependent fashion.

Conclusions
In this review we discussed the role of estrogens
and progestagens in the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin
signaling as well as the involvement of activated Wnt/βcatenin signaling in the development of endometrial
cancer. Evidence indicates that estrogens can induce
Wnt/β-catenin signaling and that enhanced or unopposed
estrogen signaling, as well as activated Wnt/β-catenin
signaling may underlie endometrial hyperplasia and
cancer. Furthermore, progesterone was shown to be a
strong inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The latter is
of clinical relevance as it is well known that progesterone
can inhibit endometrial hyperplasia and well differentiated
endometrial cancer growth.
These observations place Wnt/β-catenin signaling at
the center of physiological regulation of the menstrual cycle
and point at a central functional role for its uncontrolled
activation in endometrial carcinogenesis. Although
Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitors (e.g. CGP049090,
PKF115-584 [88] and XAV939 [89]) have not yet been
introduced into clinical practice and likewise have not
been considered for endometrial cancer treatment, the
experimental data here summarized may lay the basis
for future tailor-made therapies based on members of the
canonical Wnt pathway or its downstream targets.
