ABSTRACT
Hypoxic microenvironment is critically involved in the response of non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to chemotherapy, the mechanisms of which remain largely
unknown. Here, we found that NSCLC patients exhibited increased chemotherapeutic
resistance when complicated by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a
critical cause of chronic hypoxemia. The downregulation of uncoupling protein
2 (UCP2), which is attributed to hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)-mediated
suppression of the transcriptional factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
g (PPARg), was involved in NSCLC chemoresistance, and predicted a poor survival
rate of patients receiving routine chemotherapy. UCP2 suppression induced reactive
oxygen species production and upregulation of the ABC transporter protein ABCG2,
which leads to chemoresistance by promoting drug efflux. UCP2 downregulation also
altered metabolic rates as shown by elevated glucose uptake and reduced oxygen
consumption. These data suggest that UCP2 is a key mediator of hypoxia-triggered
chemoresistance of NSCLCs, which can be potentially targeted in clinical treatment
of chemo-refractory NSCLCs.

kinases involved in proliferative or survival signaling,
defects in the apoptotic machinery, and the overexpression
of membrane transporters, e.g., ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters, which function as outward pumps for
chemotherapeutic drugs [2, 3]. In addition, the hypoxic
microenvironment of solid tumors contributes to the
development of chemotherapy resistance by promoting
malignant phenotypes [4]. The hallmark of hypoxia in
neoplastic cells is the expression of hypoxia-inducible
factor (HIF). The highly regulated HIF-1α or HIF-2α
subunit heterodimerizes with a constitutively expressed
HIF-1β subunit to form the active transcription factor
HIF-1 or HIF-2, respectively [5]. As a master regulator
of oxygen homeostasis, HIF-1 induces the expression of
hypoxia-responsive genes involved in the survival and

INTRODUCTION
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is
among the leading causes of cancer mortality worldwide,
is characterized by relative insensitivity to radiation and
chemotherapy [1]. Most chemotherapeutic drugs block
malignant cell survival and proliferation by inducing
oxidative damage, impairing DNA biosynthesis, or
disrupting cytoskeleton assembly, thereby inducing
cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death [1]. However,
cancer cells can develop resistance to the cytotoxicity
of chemotherapy through diverse mechanisms that
remain poorly understood [2, 3]. Chemoresistant cells
are characterized by increased activity of specific growth
factor pathways or constitutive activation of downstream

mitosis of carcinoma cells. Meanwhile, HIF-1 is required
for the maintenance of malignant phenotypes, such as
the self-renewal of cancer stem cells and resistance to
anticancer therapeutics [6]. However, the key mediators
and cellular events associated with hypoxia-induced
chemotherapy resistance remain to be defined.
Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are a family of
mitochondrial proteins, which were originally reported
to play essential roles in reducing the mitochondrial
membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production given the extreme sensitivity of ·O2− production
to the proton motive force in the mitochondrial matrix
of mammalian cells [7]. However, recent studies have
proposed that UCP2 reduces ROS by acting as a metabolic
regulator of glucose, fatty acid and glutamine oxidation
rather than via proton leakage [8]. UCP1 and UCP3 are
expressed exclusively in brown adipose tissue and muscle,
respectively, whereas UCP2 is found in many types of
tissues with particularly robust expression in the lung
epithelium and in macrophages [7, 9]. Disruption of UCP2
in mice triggers immune resistance to infection, suppresses
inflammatory responses, and results in increased
susceptibility to atherosclerosis, which are at least partially
attributed to increased ROS production [10]. UCP2 plays a
role in carcinogenesis in various tissues and regulates the
responsiveness of carcinomas to chemotherapy [9, 11, 12].
However, the precise role of UCP2 in the chemotherapy
sensitivity of tumors including NSCLC is currently under
debate [9, 12]. In the present study, we show that UCP2
is downregulated in hypoxic NSCLC cells in correlation
with reduced susceptibility to chemotherapeutic drugs.
NSCLC patients with concurrent chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) showed increased resistance
to chemotherapy. Hypoxia decreased UCP2 via HIF-1mediated suppression of peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-γ (PPAR-γ). UCP2 downregulation resulted in
increased expression of the ABC transporter ABCG2, as
well as reprogrammed glucose metabolism.

(IC50) (Figure 1B, 1C). Exposure to hypoxic conditions
reduced the ability of chemotherapeutic drugs to inhibit
colony formation or trigger apoptosis of NSCLC cell
lines H520 and H1299 (Figure 1D, 1E). Taken together,
these findings suggest that hypoxia contributes to the
development of chemoresistance in NSCLC cells.

UCP2 downregulation is involved in hypoxiadriven chemoresistance

RESULTS

UCP2 plays a role in the regulation of cell survival
by affecting ROS generation, redox status, and ATP
production [9, 11]; therefore, we examined whether
UCP2 is involved in the hypoxia-mediated desensitization
of NSCLC cells to chemotherapy. Our results showed
that UCP2 expression was downregulated in malignant
tissues of patients with COPD and NSCLC compared
with that in patients with NSCLC alone, suggesting a role
of COPD-related hypoxia in regulating UCP2 expression
(Figure 2A). Immunohistochemical assessment of clinical
samples showed that UCP2 expression was significantly
lower in the tumor tissues of chemoresistant NSCLC
patients than in those of chemotherapy-sensitive patients
(Figure 2B). When patients were grouped according
to UCP2 expression in carcinoma tissues, NSCLC
patients with high UCP2 expression levels had longer
progression-free survival (PFS) than those with low UCP2
expression (Figure 2C). In cultured NSCLC cells, hypoxia
downregulated UCP2 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
2D, 2E). Knockdown of UCP2 in NSCLC cell lines
reduced the tumor inhibition rates of chemotherapeutic
agents, whereas overexpression of UCP2 sensitized
refractory cell lines to chemotherapy (Figure 2F to 2H).
UCP2 knockdown promoted in vitro colony formation and
decreased the rate of apoptosis in NSCLC cells treated
with cisplatin or docetaxel (Figure 2I, 2J). In addition,
UCP2 silencing accelerated NSCLC migration in a
wound-healing assay (Figure 2K). These results suggested
that UCP2 plays a regulatory role in the hypoxia-induced
resistance of NSCLCs to chemotherapy.

NSCLC cells to chemotherapy

Hypoxia represses UCP2 expression by
downregulating PPAR-γ in NSCLC

COPD is among the common causes of chronic
hypoxemia [13]. Clinical assessment showed that
concurrent COPD decreased the survival of NSCLC
patients receiving routine chemotherapy, suggesting
that hypoxia may facilitate the development of
chemoresistance in NSCLCs (Figure 1A). We next
examined the effects of hypoxia on the sensitivity of
NSCLC cell lines to chemotherapy. Hypoxia alone
markedly reduced the inhibitory rate of chemotherapeutic
agents on NSCLC cells, whereas exposure of cells to
low environmental oxygen increased the cisplatin and
docetaxel concentrations causing 50% growth inhibition

Because UCP2 transcription is activated by
certain factors such as JAK2/STAT3 and PPARγ
[14, 15], we examined the effect of hypoxia on these
transcription factors. PPARγ was downregulated while
STAT3 phosphorylation was promoted by low oxygen
concentrations (Figure 3A). Knockdown of PPARγ but
not STAT3 under conditions of normoxia downregulated
UCP2, whereas treatment of cells with rosiglitazone, a
PPARγ agonist, promoted UCP2 expression (Figure 3B
to 3D). PPARγ silencing mitigated the inhibitory potency
of cisplatin and docetaxel on NSCLC cells (Figure 3E).
While we failed to detect the direct association of PPARγ

with the UCP2 promoter (data not shown), these results
are in agreement with a previous report showing that
PPARγ promotes UCP2 expression by binding to intron 1
of the UCP3 gene and thereby interacting with the UCP2
gene via DNA looping [15]. These data suggest that UCP2
is a transcriptional target of PPAR-γ, which was repressed
by hypoxia in NSCLC cells.

cells. Knockdown of the β subunit of HIF-1, which
inhibits HIF-1 transactivation activity, resulted in the
upregulation of PPARγ and UCP2 in NSCLC cells
(Figure 4C). HIF-1 regulates PPARγ via the transcription
factor DEC1 (Stra13) [17]. Consistently, we found that
knockdown of DEC1 abrogated the inhibitory effect
of hypoxia on PPARγ and UCP2 (Figure 4D). These
data suggest that HIF-1-mediated UCP2 suppression
is dependent on the downregulation of PPARγ via the
DEC1/Stra13 transcriptional repressor complex in
NSCLC cells.

HIF-1 mediates the effect of hypoxia on the
downregulation of PPARγ and UCP2
HIF-1 is the predominant hypoxia-responsive
protein leading to changes in gene expression profiles
[16]. Our results showed that hypoxia upregulated the
alpha subunit of HIF-1 (HIF-1α) (Figure 4A), consistent
with the upregulation of canonical HIF-1 target genes
such as VEGF and PDGF-B (Figure 4B) in NSCLC

that function as ATP-driven efflux pumps for anticancer
agents [18]. ABC transporters translocate various
substrates across cellular membranes [18]. Therefore, we
examined the expression of ABC transporter members in
NSCLC cells, and found that ABCG2 was upregulated
upon hypoxia exposure (Figure 5A). ABCG2 can be
transcriptionally activated by nuclear factor erythroid

2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor
stabilized by ROS [19]. Consistently, we found that
Nrf2 expression was enhanced by hypoxic exposure of
NSCLC cells, which is in accordance with increased
ROS levels and downregulated UCP2 in hypoxic cells
(Figure 5A, 5B). Treatment of cells with N-acetylL-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, downregulated

Nrf2 and ABCG2 but not UCP2 in hypoxic cells, and
improved the sensitivity of cells to cisplatin (Figure 5C,
5D). UCP2 overexpression downregulated Nrf2 and
ABCG2, which is consistent with UCP2 suppression
of hypoxia-induced ROS production and an increase
of ROS levels upon UCP2 knockdown in normoxic
cells (Figure 5E, 5F). The correlation of UCP2
downregulation and the increase in Nrf2 and ABCG2
levels with chemotherapy responsiveness was verified
by assays using chemo-sensitive and -resistant clinical
NSCLC samples (Figure 5G). These data indicated that
UCP2 dysfunction may confer chemoresistance through
ROS-mediated Nrf2 stabilization and the consequent
upregulation of the drug efflux transporter ABCG2 in
NSCLC cells.

whether metabolic reprogramming is involved in
the accelerated proliferation of UCP2-suppressed
cells, we examined the glucose metabolism of cells
exposed to different oxygen concentrations. We found
that UCP2 knockdown remarkably increased glucose
uptake and lactate production (Figure 6A), whereas
UCP2 overexpression in cells pre-exposed to hypoxia
significantly decreased glucose consumption and
lactate production (Figure 6B). In addition, the steadystate amounts of several components of the oxidative
phosphorylation complexes, including subunits of the
respiratory complexes I, II, and IV, were significantly
decreased in hypoxic cells (Figure 6C). These results
indicated that UCP2 downregulation may promote
glucose metabolic conversion from aerobic oxidation to
glycolysis in NSCLC cells.

of solid tumors including NSCLCs [4, 20]. Hypoxia
modulates the microenvironment and the extracellular
matrix to facilitate tumor growth, whereas alterations in
gene expression profiles and signaling events in cancer
cells per se dictate their malignant phenotypes, including
chemotherapy resistance [21, 22]. Cancer cells may
acquire resistance to chemotherapy through the hypoxiainduced expression of drug-pumping proteins, such as
multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1)/p-glycoprotein (P-gp)/
ABCB1, a known transcriptional target of HIF-1 [23].
Alternatively, hypoxia indirectly induces drug resistance
by promoting malignant behaviors such as cell survival,
proliferation, and migration, which occurs through the
activation of oncogenic signaling or the impairment
of the cell death or differentiation machinery [4, 22].
Consistent with these paradigms, we established here
that UCP2 is downregulated in response to decreased
environmental oxygen supply in NSCLC cells. UCP2
deficiency facilitated the development of chemoresistance
via refractory apoptosis and the reprogramming of glucose
metabolism in NSCLC cells exposed to chemotherapy.
In addition, UCP2 downregulation promoted the efflux
of chemotherapeutic drugs by upregulating ABCG2
(Figure 6D). These data suggest that UCP2 is an essential
mediator of NSCLC chemoresistance in the context of
oxygen deprivation. Despite the apparent discrepancies
concerning the role of UCP2 in carcinogenesis and cancer
progression in different types of cells, e.g. UCP2 inhibition
of apoptosis in hypoxia, our findings are in accordance
with recent reports that UCP2 represses the malignant
phenotypes of melanoma, glioma, and pancreatic cancer

cells and that UCP2 deficiency mimics the effects of
hypoxia in pulmonary hypertension [10, 11, 24, 25]. UCP2
was also shown to downregulate HIF-1, which, together
with our finding that HIF-1 mediated hypoxia-triggered
silencing of UCP2, suggests a regulatory circuit between
UCP2 and HIF-1 determining the phenotypes of hypoxic
malignant cells [10]. Although it is unclear how UCP2
deficiency facilitates the migration of NSCLC cells, the
production of ROS, which was found to be increased by
UCP2 knockdown, has been demonstrated to expedite
metastasis of lung cancer [26]. In addition, both cell lines
used in this study are p53-deficient, which is critically
involved in mitochondrial energy dynamics [27]. It is thus
worth further investigation whether p53 cooperates with
UCP2 to suppress the malignant phenotypes of NSCLC
cells.
UCP2 acts as a negative regulator of ROS
generation in the mitochondrion that is predominantly
involved in the respiratory electron transport chain and
ATP biosynthesis, [8]. Endogenous ROS is produced via
multiple mechanisms, in which the incomplete reduction
of oxygen and thereby the generation of the superoxide
radical (·O2−) on the mitochondrial membrane represents
a major source of ROS [28, 29]. Instead of the originally
reported uncoupling activity, Bouillaud linked UCP2
regulation of ROS to its involvement in the transport of
four-carbon metabolites [8]. Hypoxia increases ROS
generation, and ROS induces HIF-1α accumulation
in mammalian cells, although the detailed underlying
mechanism remains uncharacterized [30]. In the present
study, increased ROS production in hypoxic NSCLC

cells was at least partially caused by HIF-1 suppression
of PPARγ and consequently the PPARγ target gene,
UCP2 [15]. In contrast to accelerated ROS production at
complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain
upon acute exposure of cells to hypoxic conditions, the
HIF-1/PPARγ/UCP2 pathway defined here may represent
a long-term mode of ROS regulation and maintenance
in hypoxic carcinomas [31]. As a double-edged sword
regarding carcinogenesis and cancer progression, ROS
is detrimental to the normal function of macromolecules

and the survival of mammalian cells, including neoplastic
cells, whereas ROS can also facilitate cancer progression
by eliciting genetic mutations and affecting the expression
of oncogenes and tumor suppressors [32, 33]. In addition,
ROS is required for the activation of growth factor
signaling pathways that drive cell cycle progression, and
for chronic inflammation, a major mediator of various
cancers [29, 34]. Cancer cells exhibit greater ROS stress
than normal cells because of increased metabolic activity
and mitochondrial malfunction, and mitochondrial ROS

perturbation plays a role in conferring resistance to
chemotherapy [33, 35]. We found that excessive ROS
promoted chemotherapy resistance in NSCLC cells by
upregulating the ABC transporter ABCG2 through a
mechanism involving the canonical Nrf2 antioxidant
pathway [36]. ROS plays a role in apoptosis resistance and
the metabolic reprogramming of malignant cells, which
may explain our observation that UCP2 deregulation in
the context of hypoxia was associated with suppressed
apoptosis, elevated glucose uptake, and reduced oxygen
consumption in NSCLC cells [37, 38]. Analysis of the
abnormalities of UCP2-disrupted mice provides insight
into the functions of this protein in addition to blocking
ROS generation [39]. Meanwhile, considering the pivotal
role of the mitochondrion in apoptotic signaling and cell
metabolism, it is likely that other proteins cooperate with
UCP2 in the regulation of these processes [40]. Therefore,
detailed mechanistic investigations are needed to unravel
the way UCP2 regulates the mitochondrial levels of the
respiratory complexes.
As a key regulator of chemotherapy susceptibility
in NSCLCs, UCP2 expression is fine-tuned at various

levels [41, 42]. Several UCP2 gene polymorphisms are
associated with distinct mRNA levels and physiological
functions [41]. In addition, UCP2 mRNA is posttranscriptionally regulated by both microRNAs and
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K)
[41]. Evidence that UCP2 mRNA levels do not correlate
with protein expression suggests that UCP2 is also
regulated at the translational level [42-44]. Nonetheless,
accumulating data indicate that the transcription of the
UCP2 gene modulates the cellular levels of the UCP2
protein. UCP2 gene transcription is potentially activated
by specificity protein 1, STAT3, FoxA1, Smad4, PPARs,
and sterol response element-binding protein 1 in various
types of cells [41, 42]. In addition, nutritional metabolites
including fatty acids and glutamate, and hormones such as
insulin, leptin, and adiponectin, play important regulatory
roles in UCP2 expression in adipose and skeletal muscle
[42, 45]. Here, we found in NSCLC cells that hypoxia
downregulated UCP2 via HIF-1-mediated suppression
of the transcriptional factor PPARγ; however, whether
an endogenous activating ligand for PPARγ is needed for
UCP2 expression remains unclear. In the present study, we

failed to detect a direct occupancy of the PPARγ promoter
region. This is consistent with a recent study in which
chromatin conformation capture was used to show that
PPARγ transactivates UCP2 in adipocytes through a DNA
loop encompassing the UCP2 promoter and the first intron
of the neighboring UCP3 loci, where PPARγ is primarily
recruited [15]. Taken together, our findings revealed a
PPARγ-dependent regulatory mechanism of UCP2 by
hypoxia and highlighted the multifaceted role of UCP2
in counteracting the chemotherapy resistance of NSCLCs.

and
5'-GGATCCTCAGGTCAGCAGCAGGAG-3'.
The

purchased from GenPharma.

The human lung cancer H520, H1299, SW900,
H1975, and SPC-A1 cells were obtained from the Type
Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
All cell lines were tested and authenticated by short
tandem repeat profiling analysis, and were passaged
and used within 6 months after authentication. Cells
were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco BRL,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS; Gibco BRL), 2 mM L-glutamine,

were added into wells and incubated for an additional
24 h under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. At the end
of the incubation, viable cells were quantified using the
Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) method (7Sea Pharmatech,
Shanghai, China). Briefly, 10 μl of CCK-8 and 100 μl
of medium were added to each well of an assay. After
incubation at 37°C for 3 h, a Bio-Rad iMARK™
microplate reader was used to detect the optical density
at 450 nm.

Colony formation assay

ROS assay, glucose consumption, and lactate
production

Cells (200/well) were seeded on a 6 cm dish and
cultured in complete medium for 10 days. Cells were fixed
with methanol, stained with crystal violet, and washed
with PBS three times before fixing and staining. Colonies
were washed with ddH2O after 30 min of staining. The
number and area of colonies were calculated with Image
J software 5.0.

Cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia or
subjected to treatment with cisplatin or docetaxel for 24h.
ROS was detected by the DCFDA Cellular ROS Detection
Assay Kit (Beyotime) according to the manual. The
ROS level in each group was quantified according to the
fluorescence of DCFDA. The fluorescence of DCFDA was
excited with a 488 nm laser and detected at 525 nm using a
TECAN GENios Pro (TECAN, Männedorf, Switzerland).
Glucose and lactate concentrations in the supernatants
were measured with Glucose assay and Lactic Acid
assay kits (Jiancheng, China). Glucose consumption
was calculated by subtracting the glucose concentration
detected from the blank well.

Apoptosis assay
Cells were plated at a density of 2.0 × 105 cells/well
in 6-well plates, incubated for 24 h in complete medium,
serum starved for 12 h, and then treated as indicated.
Complete medium with 30 μM cisplatin was added into
wells and incubated for 24 h under normoxia or hypoxia.
Flow cytometry was used to detect the percentage of dying
cells with the Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection
kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Beyotime,
Shanghai, China). Flow cytometry was performed with the
FACScan system using Cell Quest software.

Patients and follow-up
Samples from ten primary NSCLC patients with
COPD or emphysema were collected from the clinical
samples bank of Tangdu Hospital of the Fourth Military
Medical University (Xi’an) in China starting in 2006.
Patients with NSCLC alone or NSCLC combined with
COPD according to the available clinical information were
selected randomly and double-blindly. UCP2 expression
level variation between cancerous and paracancerous
tissues was examined in another 51 NSCLC patients
selected randomly from the sample bank. The clinical
characteristics of patients were obtained from hospital
records. Sample collection was performed with informed
consent and approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Fourth Military Medical University. 34 patients that
displayed decreased UCP2 in tumors compared with
paracancerous tissues in qRT-PCR assay are included
in UCP2-low group, whereas 17 patients showing
upregulated UCP2 in tumors are designated as the UCP2high group. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the
date of surgery until death, or until the date of the last
follow-up visit for patients who were still alive.

Cell migration assay
Migration was assessed using cell scratch assays
in the different groups. Cells were plated in 6-well plates
in 2 ml of complete medium. When a monolayer of cells
was formed, a scratch was introduced by scraping the
monolayer with a P200 pipette tip. After addition of 2 ml
of serum-free medium into each well, cells were allowed
to migrate for the indicated times. The distances between
the edges of the scratch were measured to quantitatively
evaluate cell migration.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical analyses were performed
using a streptavidin/peroxidase staining kit (Cat. # SP9000, Zymed Laboratories, San Diego, CA, USA). The
4 μm paraffin-embedded slices were deparaffinized and
rehydrated in a xylene/alcohol gradient. After digestion
in a 3 M urea solution for 30 min, the slices were boiled
in a Citrate Antigen Retrieval Solution for 10 min in a
microwave oven. Next, slices were incubated in 5% H2O2
for 20 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity,
followed by goat serum to block non-specific binding,
and then incubated with primary antibodies against UCP2
(Clone # sc-6526, Santa Cruz), ABCG2 (Cat. # 4477, Cell
Signaling), or Nrf2 (Cat. # 12721, Cell Signaling) in a
moist chamber overnight at 4°C. The next day, slices were
incubated in secondary antibodies (Millipore, Billerica)
for 30 min at 37°C. Finally, slides were incubated in DAB
solution (Cat. # ZLI-9017, Zymed) to detect peroxidase
activity and counterstained with hematoxylin. Two
independent pathologists assessed the stained slides under
a microscope in a double blind system.

Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using SPSS standard version
19.0 and Graph Pad Prism version 5.0. Data were obtained
from three independent experiments and presented as the
mean ± standard error. Survival rate was analyzed by the
Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank
test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
