Abstract
Tumor angiogenesis is a key event in cancer progression. Here, we report that tumors can stimulate tumor
angiogenesis by secretion of galectin-1. Tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis of different tumor models are
hampered in galectin-1–null (gal-1−/−) mice. However, tumor angiogenesis is less affected when tumor cells
express and secrete high levels of galectin-1. Furthermore, tumor endothelial cells in gal-1−/− mice take up
galectin-1 that is secreted by tumor cells. Uptake of galectin-1 by cultured endothelial cells specifically promotes H-Ras signaling to the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)
kinase (Mek)/Erk cascade and stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, the activation
can be blocked by galectin-1 inhibition as evidenced by hampered membrane translocation of H-Ras.GTP and
impaired Raf/Mek/Erk phosphorylation after treatment with the galectin-1–targeting angiogenesis inhibitor
anginex. Altogether, these data identify galectin-1 as a proangiogenic factor. These findings have direct implications for current efforts on galectin-1–targeted cancer therapies. Cancer Res; 70(15); 6216–24. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
To promote angiogenesis, tumors secrete growth factors
such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) that induce endothelial cell activation in nearby vessels. In response, the endothelial cells
embark on a multistep process that results in new blood vessel
formation. Evidence is increasing that endothelial galectins
play a critical role in the endothelial adaptations associated
with tumor angiogenesis (1). Especially, galectin-1 seems to
fulfill a central role in the tumor vasculature during cancer
progression. Elevated galectin-1 expression has been reported
in the vasculature of many human tumors, including colon (2),
head and neck, lung (3), prostate (4), and oral (5) cancers.
Moreover, activation of endothelial cells by tumor cell–derived

growth signals results in elevated galectin-1 expression (2, 6, 7)
and translocation of the protein to the endothelial cell surface (2, 8).
We have recently shown that endothelial galectin-1 is
directly implicated in proper cell function during tumor
angiogenesis (7). Knockdown of galectin-1 expression in
endothelial cells inhibits proliferation and migration, whereas galectin-1–null (gal-1−/−) mice display hampered tumor
growth due to decreased angiogenic activity (7). In addition,
it has been shown that endothelial galectin-1 is important for
cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components (5) and that
galectin-1 inhibitors can prevent endothelial tube formation
(9). Based on all these findings, it has been proposed that
targeting endothelial galectin-1 might be a promising angiostatic cancer therapy (1). Indeed, we have shown that tumors
in gal-1−/− mice do not respond to galectin-1–targeted antiangiogenesis therapy (7).
Recent studies also suggest a role for exogenous galectin-1
in endothelial cell function. Knockdown of galectin-1 expression in glioblastoma tumor cells reduced the number of
tumor vessels following injection of the cells in mice (10).
In addition, exogenous galectin-1 was described to act as
an endothelial chemoattractant and to enhance the viability
and adhesion of cultured endothelial cells (5). Because increased expression of the protein has been reported in different human cancers (11–13), we hypothesized that galectin-1
secreted by tumor cells could also stimulate tumor angiogenesis via activation of endothelial cells. In the current study,
we provide for the first time evidence that tumor-derived
galectin-1 can indeed act as a proangiogenesis factor. We
show that tumor endothelial cells in gal-1−/− mice take up
galectin-1 from galectin-1–secreting tumor cells. Furthermore,
we provide evidence that exogenous galectin-1 specifically

promotes endothelial H-Ras signaling toward the Raf/
mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (Erk) kinase (Mek)/Erk pathway and that it stimulates
endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Moreover, this
activation can be blocked by galectin-1 inhibition, which has
direct implications for current efforts on galectin-1–targeted
cancer therapies.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Human recombinant galectin-1 and polyclonal antihuman
galectin-1 antibody were kindly provided by Dr. L. Baum
(University of California, Los Angeles, CA). The antisense
galectin-1 expression vector (pcDNA6-lag1) and the B16F10
galectin-1 knockdown (B16F10kd) cells were a kind gift of
Dr. G. Rabinovich (Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental, Buenos Aires, Argentina).
Cell culture
Endothelial cells were cultured as described previously
(14). For the endothelial cell assays, serum-rich medium
was replaced with culture medium containing 2% serum
24 h before the start of the experiment. B16F10 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS and L-glutamine.
TC-1 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's
medium supplemented with 10% FCS, L -glutamine, and
20 nmol/L β-mercaptoethanol.
Galectin-1 ELISA
A 96-well plate was coated overnight at 4°C with mouse
monoclonal anti–galectin-1 antibody (Invitrogen) and
blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 hour at
room temperature before applying culture medium for
1 hour at room temperature. Subsequently, wells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti–galectin-1 antibody for
1 hour followed by a 30-minute incubation with biotinconjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Finally, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated streptavidin was applied
for 30 minutes and staining reaction was initiated by adding
TMB staining solution. Reaction was stopped by adding 1
volume of 1 mol/L H2SO4, and absorbance was measured at
450 nm. Between all the incubation steps, the wells were washed
three times with 0.1% Tween 20/milliQ. Negative controls
included omission of secondary antibody, tertiary antibody,
and/or streptavidinHRP. A standard curve with recombinant
human galectin-1 was included as positive control.
Mouse tumor models
The F9 teratocarcinoma model has been described previously (7). For additional experiments, the original 129P3/J
gal-1−/− mutant mice (15) were backcrossed to the C57Bl6
background. On day 0, animals were injected s.c. with ∼1 ×
105 B16F10 cells or ∼1 × 106 TC-1 cells. Tumor volumes were
measured throughout the experiment. Animals were given
water and standard chow ad libitum, and they were kept
on a 12-hour light/dark cycle.

For the isogenic tumor model systems, 500,000 mouse
B16F10 melanoma cells [either wild-type (wt; ATCC CRL6475) or gal-1kd cells] were injected i.v. into the tail vein of
the mice. Six-week-old wt C57Bl6 mice were purchased from
Charles Rivers. Gal-1–knockout mice were generated previously and bred in our laboratory (Poirier and Robertson, Development 1993; Institut Jacques Monod, Paris, France).
Lungs were collected after euthanasia of dying mice and
fixed for 48 hours in 4% formalin for further H&E staining.
The in vivo experiments described in the present study were
performed on the basis of Authorization No. LA1230568 of
the Animal Ethics Committee of the Federal Department of
Health, Nutritional Safety, and the Environment (Belgium).
Proliferation, migration, and chorioallantoic
membrane assays
Migration, proliferation, and chorioallantoic membrane
(CAM) assays were done as described elsewhere (16). Within
each proliferation experiment, sample conditions were
included in triplicate and independent proliferation and
migration experiments were performed at least three times.
For the CAM assay, n = 8 eggs were used in each treatment
group.
Generation of stable gal-1kd cells
To generate stable EC-RF24 gal-1kd cells, 1 million ECRF24 cells were transfected with 1 μg of linearized
pcDNA6-lag1 (17) or empty pcDNA6 (mock) by electroporation using the Amaxa Nucleofector system, following the
manufacturer's protocol. Cells were cultured as described
above in the presence of 5 μg/mL blasticidin for further
in vitro experiments. Downregulation of expression was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis
according standard procedures using the anti–galectin-1 polyclonal antibody. The mock-transfected cells were used for normalization and FACS experiments were done in triplicate.
Analysis of galectin-1 uptake
Labeling of galectin-1 with Oregon Green 488 (OG488) was
achieved by incubation of human recombinant galectin-1 with
OG488 succinimidyl ester for 20 hours at a molecular ratio of
1:2. Progression of labeling was monitored by matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry
according to standard procedures. This confirmed that
galectin-1 was, on average, labeled with 2 OG488 molecules.
OG488-labeled galectin-1 (gal-1OG488) or unlabeled galectin-1
was subsequently added to human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVEC) cultured in 2% serum–containing medium at
the indicated concentrations. After 3 or 24 hours, medium
was replaced with fresh, galectin-1–free medium and fluorescent images were acquired and processed using Adobe Photoshop CS2 with a Leica inverted fluorescence microscope using
a Leica 1.4Mpix DFC300FX color camera.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical stainings for galectin-1, CD31/34,
CD45+ cells, CD8+ cells, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear cells were done as described previously (2, 7).

Real-time PCR
Isolation of total RNA from snap-frozen human tumor specimens, subsequent cDNA synthesis, and real-time PCR were
done as described previously (2, 18). The galectin-1 mRNA
expression was normalized to β-actin, cyclophilin A, β2-microglobulin, and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-1.

hoc test was used in the tumor growth experiments. All
statistical computations were done using SPSS 12.0.1, except
for the two-way ANOVA, which was done with GraphPad
Prism v3.00.

Results
H-RAS signaling
RF24 cells were plated in six-wells plates at a density of
250,000 per well and grown for 24 hours in the presence of
10% FCS. The cells were then washed with medium containing 2% FCS and incubated for 48 hours in this medium in the
absence and presence of 0.1 μmol/L recombinant galectin-1.
Cells were then lysed and proteins (30–50 μg) were subjected
to SDS-PAGE followed by Western immunoblotting using
anti-pan Ras, anti–p-cRaf-1, anti-Raf, anti–p-Mek1/2 (Cell
Signaling), anti-MEK1/2, anti–p-Erk, and anti-Erk2 antibodies (19). Protein bands were visualized by incubation with
HRP secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunoblots were quantified by densitometry EZQuant Gel 2.1 software.
Statistics
All data are presented as mean ± SEM unless indicated
otherwise. For comparison of data with normal distribution,
Student's t test was used. Data that were not normally distributed were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test.
The log-rank test was used to determine statistical difference

Elevated galectin-1 expression in tumor cells has been
reported to be associated with enhanced tumor progression (11–13). To study the potential role of tumor-derived
galectin-1 in tumor progression in vivo, we backcrossed the
original 129sv gal-1−/− mouse to the C57Bl6 background. This
allowed us to apply two syngeneic tumor models (i.e., B16F10
melanoma cells and TC-1 lung carcinoma cells) that show
high mRNA expression and increased galectin-1 protein
secretion as compared with the previously described F9
teratocarcinoma model (Fig. 1A and B). Similar to the previously published data for the F9 model (7), both B16F10
cells and TC-1 cells showed a significant inhibition of
tumor growth in the gal-1−/− mice as compared with wt mice
(gal-1wt; Fig. 1C). The average growth inhibition in these
tumor models ranged from 67% (F9 tumors) to 59% (B16F10
tumors) and 42% (TC-1 tumors), whereas maximal inhibition
was ∼70% for all three tumor types. Because galectin-1 has
been associated with tumor immune escape (17), we determined whether galectin-1 expression levels induced different
antitumor immune responses in gal-1wt and gal-1−/− mice.

gal-1−/− mice is tumor type independent.

TC-1 cells (1 × 106).

Galectin-1 Induces Angiogenesis

Figure 2. Tumor-derived galectin-1 can compensate for the lack of galectin-1 in the tumor endothelium of gal-1−/− mice. A, overall tumor growth of two
independent experiments with TC-1 lung carcinoma cells in gal-1wt and gal-1−/− mice. B, immunohistochemical vessel staining (brown) in TC-1 and F9
tumors in gal-1wt and gal-1−/− mice. Diagram on the right shows the quantification of MVD in TC-1 and F9 tumors in gal-1wt and gal-1−/− mice.

that are negative for galectin-1 in the F9 tumors and positive for galectin-1 in the TC-1 tumors. D, fluorescent microscopic images of endothelial cells
cultured in the presence of gal-1OG488 (green). Left, control cells treated with unlabeled galectin-1.

In all models, the tumor incidence and the onset of tumor
growth were comparable between gal-1wt and gal-1−/− mice
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Furthermore, and as already reported
for the F9 model (7), immunohistochemical quantification of
tumor-infiltrating leukocytes revealed no significant differences in the numbers of CD45+ cells, CD8+ cells, macrophages,
or polymorphonuclear cells between gal-1wt and gal-1−/− mice
in the B16F10 or the TC-1 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1).
This indicates that the immune response was comparable
between gal-1wt and gal-1−/− mice.
Because we have previously shown that tumor angiogenesis is impaired in gal-1−/− mice (7), we next investigated the
involvement of tumor-derived galectin-1 in this process. We
focused on the TC-1 model because these cells display an almost 20-fold higher galectin-1 expression as compared with
F9 cells. A second experiment using a larger group of mice
confirmed the impaired TC-1 tumor growth in gal-1−/− mice
(Fig. 2A). Immunohistochemical staining of the endothelial
cells and subsequent vessel quantification revealed a significantly decreased microvessel density (MVD) in the tumors of
gal-1−/− mice as compared with gal-1wt animals (Fig. 2B).
Interestingly, with an MVD reduction of 20%, the inhibitory
effect on angiogenesis was only half of that observed in the
F9 tumors. Based on this, we hypothesized that the high level
of galectin-1 expression by TC-1 cells could partially compen-

sate for the absence of galectin-1 in the tumor endothelium.
As expected from the mRNA expression levels, we observed
higher galectin-1 protein expression in TC-1 tumors as compared with F9 tumors (Fig. 2C, left). More interestingly, the
endothelial cells in the TC-1 tumors of gal-1−/− mice occasionally stained positive for galectin-1, which was never observed in the F9 tumors (Fig. 2C, right). Comparable
observations were made using an isogenic B16F10 tumor
model. For this, B16F10 tumor cells, either gal-1 wt or
gal-1kd (17), were injected i.v. in gal-1wt and gal-1−/− mice
resulting in lung metastases. Injection of B16F10kd cells resulted in prolonged survival in both gal-1wt and gal-1−/− mice
as compared with injection of B16F10wt cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Subsequent analysis of the MVD in the lung metastases showed a gradual decrease in MVD, going from high in
wt tumors of wt mice to low in knockdown tumors of null
mice (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Again, immunohistochemical
analysis indicated that endothelial cells in the null mice occasionally stained positive for galectin-1 (data not shown).
Because the endothelial cells of the gal-1−/− mice do not
express galectin-1, these data suggest that both in the TC-1
and in the B16F10 tumor models, the endothelial cells take
up tumor-derived galectin-1.
To study whether exogenous galectin-1 is actually taken
up by endothelial cells, we added gal-1 OG488 to cultured

endothelial cells. Already 3 hours after exposure, cellular uptake of gal-1OG488 in vesicle-like structures could be observed.
The uptake increased with time (Fig. 2D) and could be competed for by addition of unlabeled galectin-1 (Supplementary
Fig. S3). FACS analysis after addition of trypan blue to quench
extracellular fluorescence showed that gal-1OG488 was indeed
present in the cytoplasm of the cells (data not shown). These
data show that endothelial cells are able to rapidly take up
large amounts of galectin-1 from their environment.
To study the direct effects of exogenous galectin-1 on the
different key steps of the angiogenesis cascade, primary isolated HUVEC as well as the endothelial cell line EC-RF24
were cultured under low-serum conditions and subjected

to a broad concentration range of soluble galectin-1. We observed a small but significant induction of HUVEC proliferation at 0.1 μmol/L galectin-1, which was reversed at higher
concentrations (Fig. 3A, left diagram). In EC-RF24 cells, the
stimulatory effect of galectin-1 was more pronounced with
significant induction of proliferation up to 2.5 μmol/L (Fig.
3A, right diagram). We next determined the effects of exogenous galectin-1 on endothelial cell migration. Similar to endothelial cell proliferation, inactivation of endothelial cells by
low-serum conditions resulted in a hampered endothelial cell
migration (Fig. 3B). In both HUVEC and EC-RF24, addition of
galectin-1 to the culture medium effectively stimulated cell
migration to a level similar to that obtained with bFGF

Galectin-1 Induces Angiogenesis

restore the migration capacity of RF24kd cells. Conditions are as in C, and migration at each time point is shown as relative values compared with t = 0.

(Fig. 3C). Experiments using the in ovo chicken CAM assay
showed that exogenous galectin-1 induces a concentrationdependent increase in the number of vessels (Fig. 3D). These
data show that exogenous galectin-1 exerts a proangiogenesis effect on endothelial cells. In nonendothelial cells, exogenous galectin-1 has been suggested to induce biphasic
growth effects (20–22). We also observed biphasic effects
on endothelial cell proliferation and migration. This suggests
that the effects of exogenous galectin-1 are influenced by the
cellular activation status. This was confirmed when increasing amounts of galectin-1 were added to cells cultured under
high-serum conditions (Supplementary Fig. S4). Because we
have previously shown that activated endothelial cells have
increased galectin-1 levels, we questioned whether the biphasic response to exogenous galectin-1 was influenced by
the endogenous endothelial galectin-1 expression. To study
this, a stable knockdown cell line was generated by transfecting EC-RF24 cells with a previously described antisense
galectin-1 expression construct (17). This induced a significant decrease in endogenous galectin-1 protein content
(40% reduction, P = 0.002; Fig. 4A). As a result, both cell proliferation and migration were decreased as compared with
wt and mock-transfected cells (data not shown). Adding increasing amounts of exogenous galectin-1 to EC-RF24 gal-1kd
cells compensated for the inhibitory effects on proliferation
and migration without inducing any biphasic response
(Fig. 4B and C). In fact, the decreased migratory activity of
gal-1kd cells was completely reversed by exogenously added
2.5 μmol/L galectin-1 (Fig. 4D). All these data show that exogenous galectin-1 can promote and facilitate angiogenesis
by activation of endothelial cell function.

www.aacrjournals.org

Finally, we set out to determine the mechanism underlying
the galectin-induced stimulation of endothelial cells. An
important intracellular function of galectin-1 involves the
spatiotemporal organization of activated H-Ras during
Ras signaling (23). We thus postulated that exogenous
galectin-1 could promote endothelial cell proliferation and
migration through enhanced H-Ras signaling. To test this,
we examined whether exogenous galectin-1 affects Ras signaling to the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade in RF24 cells. Cells were
treated for 48 hours with 0.1 μmol/L galectin-1 and the levels
of active p-Raf, p-Mek, and p-Erk were determined by
Western blotting (Fig. 5A, left). Subsequent quantification
revealed a significant increase in Raf, Mek, and Erk phosphorylation (Fig. 5A, right), consistent with the notion that
galectin-1 enhances H-Ras signaling in EC-RF24 cells. At
higher galectin-1 concentrations, Ras signaling showed a
similar biphasic response as observed in the proliferation
assay (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Interestingly, the uptake of gal-1OG488, as described above,
occurred in small dot-like particles, resembling the H-Ras.
GTP nanoclusters or rasosomes that are found at the plasma
membrane and that occur as small, randomly moving cytoplasmic particles (24, 25). This also corroborates with previous observations that the galectin-1–binding angiostatic
peptide anginex is taken up by endothelial cells and colocalizes with galectin-1 in dot-like vesicles (7). Indeed, anginex
treatment of RF24 cells induced a decrease in Raf, Mek, and
Erk phosphorylation (Fig. 5B), which was associated with
membrane dislocation of activated H-Ras, as illustrated by
treatment of RF24 cells that were transfected with GFPtagged constitutively active H-Ras [GFP-H-Ras(G12V);

Fig. 5C, left]. Quantification revealed that galectin-1 inhibition induced a significant decrease in the percentage of cells
with membrane-bound GFP-H-Ras(G12V) (Fig. 5C, right). Importantly, the plasma membrane localization of GFP-H-Ras
(wt) was not affected (Fig. 5D, top left), which is consistent
with the notion that galectin-1 specifically interacts with active H-Ras-GTP. This was further supported when we studied
whether galectin-1 inhibition also induced displacement of
the two other Ras isoforms (i.e., K-Ras and N-Ras) whose
membrane localization is independent of galectin-1 (26). In
untreated endothelial cells (Fig. 5D, top), GFP-K-Ras(G12V)
was mainly localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5D, middle), whereas GFP-N-Ras(G13V) was localized to both the
plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 5D, right).
This is in agreement with previous findings (27). Treatment
with anginex did not induce a displacement of these Ras isoforms from their natural location (Fig. 5D, bottom). Altogether, these data suggest that exogenous galectin-1 can enhance
endothelial activity via specific activation of H-Ras signaling.

The current study describes a novel growth factor–like
function for galectin-1 involving the promotion of tumor
angiogenesis by enhancing the angiogenic activity of endothelial cells. We and others have previously shown that
galectin-1 expression is increased in activated endothelial
cells (1, 6, 7) and that endothelial activation increases
exposure of the protein at the cell surface (2, 6). Increased
galectin-1 expression has also been reported in the tumor
endothelium of different human cancers (3–5, 7, 28). Thus,
tumor-activated endothelial cells require high levels of
galectin-1 for proper function during tumor angiogenesis.
Our current data provide the first evidence that angiogenically activated endothelial cells can also derive the required
galectin-1 from an external source (i.e., the tumor). We found
that in vitro application of exogenous galectin-1 induces
endothelial cell proliferation and migration, two key steps
in the angiogenesis cascade. Hsieh and colleagues recently
described that exogenous galectin-1 increases endothelial
cell viability and adhesion and that galectin-1 can act as a
chemoattractant for endothelial cells (5). Collectively, these
data indicate that exogenous galectin-1 exerts a proangiogenesis effect on endothelial cells. Interestingly, exogenous
galectin-1 has been previously described to have a biphasic
effect on the growth of nonendothelial cells. Whereas low
concentrations (nanomolar range) induce cell proliferation,
high concentrations (micromolar range) of galectin-1 seem
to have inhibitory effects (20–22). We also observed a biphasic effect of exogenous galectin-1 on HUVEC proliferation and
migration. Moreover, in activated HUVEC, which already express high levels of endogenous galectin-1, an inhibitory
effect was already noticeable at nanomolar concentrations.
This suggests that the effects of exogenous galectin-1 are
influenced by the cell activation status. Nevertheless, the
in ovo CAM assay clearly showed an increased vessel density
in response to exogenous galectin-1. Furthermore, our
experiments in galectin-1–deficient mice show that tumor

Galectin-1 Induces Angiogenesis

angiogenesis in TC-1 tumors, which have high galectin-1
expression, is less affected by the absence of galectin-1 in
the host vasculature as compared with F9 tumors, which
have low galectin-1 expression. In the isogenic B16F10 tumor
model, knockdown of galectin-1 in the tumor cells resulted in
prolonged survival and lower MVD. A comparable observation was recently described for a glioblastoma tumor model
where siRNA-induced inhibition of tumor galectin-1 expression resulted in a lower MVD (29). These data suggest that
tumor-derived galectin-1 is involved in the regulation of
tumor angiogenesis. In support of this, our current results
obtained using gal-1kd cells and gal-1−/− mice indicate that
endothelial cells can indeed take up galectin-1 from their
environment and use it to improve cell function. Altogether,
these data suggest that tumor cells can secrete galectin-1
to promote tumor progression. Interestingly, galectin-1 is
secreted by a nonclassic pathway, and there seem to exist
common features between the secretion of galectin-1 and
that of bFGF, another potent proangiogenesis growth factor
(30–32). Moreover, Le and colleagues found a correlation
between the expression of galectin-1 and the hypoxia marker
CA-IX (33, 34). They also observed increased galectin-1
expression when different cancer cell lines were subjected
to hypoxia (33, 34). It is thus tempting to speculate that
the angiogenesis switch that tumor cells undergo in hypoxic
conditions also involves upregulation of galectin-1 expression, and that the cells subsequently use a specific secretion
route to shed galectin-1 and other angiogenesis-stimulating
proteins into the environment.
Recently, it was suggested that exogenous galectin-1 facilitates NRP1/VEGFR2 signaling, which results in increased
phosphorylation of Erk1 and c-jun NH2 -terminal kinase.
However, blocking this pathway using NRP-1 targeting siRNA
only marginally affected galectin-1–induced endothelial
proliferation and Erk phosphorylation (5). Apparently, the
role of galectin-1 in Ras signaling is not directly dependent
on NRP1/VEGFR2 signaling. An important function of galectin-1 in Ras signaling involves the spatiotemporal organization of activated H-Ras (23). Galectin-1 mediates the
formation of H-Ras.GTP/galectin-1 nanoclusters, which are
the sites of activation of Raf/Mek/Erk (24, 35). In line with
this, our data show increased phosphorylation of Raf, Mek,
and Erk in endothelial cells after treatment with exogenous
galectin-1. Moreover, the absorbed galectin-1 appeared in
small dot-like particles, resembling the H-Ras.GTP nanoclusters or rasosomes, which are found at the plasma membrane
and occur as small, randomly moving cytoplasmic particles
(24, 25). This also corroborates with our previous observations that the galectin-1–binding angiostatic peptide anginex

is also taken up by endothelial cells and colocalizes with galectin-1 in dot-like vesicles (7). Thus, anginex is most likely shuttled into the endothelial cells by galectin-1 where it
subsequently interferes with H-Ras nanocluster formation
and downstream Ras signaling. Indeed, we found that anginex
causes membrane dislocation of H-Ras.GTP and subsequent
inhibition of Raf, Mek, and Erk phosphorylation. Altogether,
these data favor a mechanism in which extracellular galectin-1 is taken up by the endothelial cells to facilitate the formation of H-Ras.GTP nanoclusters, which leads to enhanced Ras
signaling and increased cell proliferation. How the endothelial
cells take up galectin-1 remains to be elucidated. It is tempting
to speculate that the mechanism responsible for the nonclassic secretion of the protein can also internalize the protein. A
recent study in nonendothelial cells indicated that galectin-1
can be actively endocytosed. The uptake of galectin-1 was carbohydrate dependent and might involve GM1, a galectin-1–
binding glycosphingolipid (36). Further analysis revealed that
the internalization was facilitated by multiple routes (i.e., lipid-raft dependent and clathrin-mediated endocytosis; ref. 36).
Additional studies are needed to determine whether such mechanisms are also involved in endothelial uptake of galectin-1.
In summary, the data presented in the current study
provide evidence that tumor cells can induce and facilitate
tumor angiogenesis by secreting galectin-1 into the environment. The secreted galectin-1 is used by the endothelial cells
to enhance migration and proliferation. Furthermore, the
endothelial cells take up galectin-1, which enhances H-Ras
signaling. Together with its anti-inflammatory and prometastatic activities, this further exemplifies the importance of
galectin-1 in cancer biology. Moreover, it identifies galactine-1
as an excellent target for combined cancer therapy because
interfering with galectin-1 function might be beneficial at
multiple processes involved in tumor progression.
