Abstract
Progression of primary prostate cancer to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is associated with
numerous genetic and epigenetic alterations that are thought to promote survival at metastatic sites. In this study,
we investigated gene copy number and CpG methylation status in CRPC to gain insight into speciﬁc
pathophysiologic pathways that are active in this advanced form of prostate cancer. Our analysis deﬁned and
validated 495 genes exhibiting signiﬁcant differences in CRPC in gene copy number, including gains in androgen
receptor (AR) and losses of PTEN and retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Signiﬁcant copy number differences existed
between tumors with or without AR gene ampliﬁcation, including a common loss of AR repressors in ARunampliﬁed tumors. Simultaneous gene methylation and allelic deletion occurred frequently in RB1 and
HSD17B2, the latter of which is involved in testosterone metabolism. Lastly, genomic DNA from most CRPC
was hypermethylated compared with benign prostate tissue. Our ﬁndings establish a comprehensive methylation
signature that couples epigenomic and structural analyses, thereby offering insights into the genomic alterations
in CRPC that are associated with a circumvention of hormonal therapy. Genes identiﬁed in this integrated
genomic study point to new drug targets in CRPC, an incurable disease state which remains the chief therapeutic
challenge. Cancer Res; 72(3); 616–25. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Despite the effectiveness of castrating therapies in slowing
the growth of metastatic prostate cancer, therapeutic resistance eventually develops. Unchecked, metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is lethal, causing approximately 30,000 annual deaths in the United States (1).
Tissue from metastatic CRPC is difﬁcult to obtain for genetic
characterization because biopsies can be technically challenging and are generally unnecessary for routine clinical decision
making. Considerably less is therefore understood about the
later acquired genetic alterations that emerge in the context of
the selection pressure of an androgen-deprived milieu.

To address this, rapid autopsy programs were developed
to provide high-quality metastatic tissue for research (2–4).
Tissue obtained from these studies has been used for genomic
analysis and to create cell lines and xenograft models (2). In
addition, improvements in DNA and RNA array–based techniques have allowed for the acquisition of high-resolution
quantitative tumor genome information from small amounts
of tissue. This includes the quantiﬁcation of global gene copy
number (CN), expression level, and gene CpG methylation
status.
Recent studies of metastatic CRPC have examined the
variation in androgen receptor (AR) splicing (5), AR signaling
(6), tumor heterogeneity (7), and has identiﬁed new targets for
therapy (8). Similarly, a number of recent studies have implicated local androgen production by tumor cells (9–11). Genomic studies across different platforms, as described here, allow
a more thorough investigation and yield a more complete
picture of the genetic changes that occur in CRPC. In this study,
15 metastatic CRPC tumors obtained at autopsy were proﬁled
using comprehensive high-resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and methylation arrays to describe
the most common CN aberrations in metastatic CRPC and
their concordant methylation levels.

Structural and Epigenetic Changes in CRPC

from 1996–1999. Clinical characteristics have been reported
(2); all had metastatic CRPC, had received hormonal therapy,
and all but one had received chemotherapy.
To corroborate ﬁndings from the metastatic cohort, a
separate cohort of 36 intermediate grade primary prostate
tumors obtained at prostatectomy were also obtained. Patient
clinical characteristics and methods used to isolate DNA have
been reported (12). With a median of 60.2 months follow up, 14
patients had biochemical evidence of recurrent disease, whereas 22 did not.
Tissue processing
The tissue procurement procedure has been described (2).
Metastatic liver (N ¼ 7) or soft-tissue (N ¼ 8) lesions were used
for genomic analysis, including 2 separate soft-tissue deposits
from the same patient, both of which were used. A single
pathologist (MR) sectioned 15 tissue slices at 15 mm from areas
with extensive tumor involvement. DNA was extracted with a
Wizard Genomic DNA Isolation kit (Promega) and puriﬁed by
phenol/chloroform extraction. All DNAs were of sufﬁcient
quality and quantity for genomic analysis by gel chromatography and UV-Vis spectrophotometry.
Array comparative genomic hybridization
aCGH was carried out using Human Genome microarrays
(Agilent), consisting of 244,000 60-mer oligonucleotide DNA
probes with approximately 9 kb average spatial resolution,
with pooled male lymphocyte DNA (single lot, Promega) as a
reference sample. Labeling and microarray processing were
done according to the manufacturer's protocol using 500 ng of
genomic DNA. After 60-hour hybridization, microarrays were
scanned at 10 mm resolution using an Agilent-G25005B scanner. All samples passed Agilent quality control assessment.
Feature-level data was abstracted with Agilent software. CN
was expressed as the log2 ratio of tumor:control DNA ﬂuorescence intensity.
DNA methylation proﬁling
DNA was bisulﬁte converted using the EZ DNA Methylation
Kit (Zymo). DNA was then whole-genome ampliﬁed, enzymatically fragmented, precipitated, resuspended, and hybridized
overnight at 48 C to an array containing 27,578 locus-speciﬁc
oligonucleotide primers (Illumina). After hybridization, the C
or T nucleotides were detected by ﬂuorescent single-base
primer extension using an Illumina BeadStation GX scanner.
Data were analyzed with Genome Studio software (v2009.1;
Illumina) which assigns a quantitative measure of the methylation level (b value) for each CpG site, corresponding to the
ratio between the ﬂuorescence signal from the methylated
allele (C) and the sum of the ﬂuorescence signals of the
methylated (C) and unmethylated (T) alleles for that CpG site.
The methylation status for each site ranges from 0 (completely
unmethylated) to 1 (completely methylated). Conservative b
value cutoffs of 0.8, <0.8 to >0.2, and 0.2 were used,
respectively, to call a CpG locus homozygously methylated,
heterozygously methylated, or unmethylated. Hierarchical
clustering of b values used the Pearson correlation as the
similarity measure and complete linkage as the agglomeration

www.aacrjournals.org

method and was analyzed with R software. Only probes in
which 50% or more of samples had nonmissing data and which
had SD greater than the 25th percentile were used for wholegenome clustering (20,675 of 27,578), and in which not all
samples had the same methylation status (513 of 27,578) for
exploration of probes differentially methylated across samples.
Using methylated and unmethylated status encoded as 1 and
1, respectively, hierarchical clustering was done separately
with Cluster and Treeview softwares (13) using Euclidean
distance as the similarity measure and Ward's agglomeration
method (14).
Validation of candidate gene copy changes
A subset of samples showing AR copy gain or PTEN deletion
by aCGH were selected for validation using the TaqMan Gene
Copy Number Assay (Applied Biosystems) with the UCSF
Genome Core. Reference samples included pooled male lymphocyte DNA (Promega), DNA from 2 castration-sensitive
primary prostate tumors known to harbor normal AR and
PTEN CN by aCGH (unpublished data), and AR and PTEN copynormal DNA (Coriell; ref. 15). The internal reference gene was
RnaseP. Ten nanograms of DNA was used per sample and run in
quadruplicate per manufacturer's instructions. CN analysis
was done using CopyCaller software (Applied Biosystems).
Gene expression
A subset of the metastases (5 liver, 8 soft tissue) were
analyzed at the University of Michigan by Dr. Tomlins (data
available on Oncomine; ref. 16) on Agilent Whole-Human Gene
Expression 44K microarrays against pooled benign prostate
tissue (Clontech). RNA preparation has been previously
described (17). Hierarchical clustering was done using log2
ratio values, Euclidean distance, and Ward's agglomeration
method (14). Only those probes which had at least 50% of
samples with nonmissing data were considered (466 of 507
probes).
Pathway analysis
The Panther libraries (18–21) were used to identify pathways
containing genes of interest. A binomial statistical tool is used
to compare classiﬁcations of multiple clusters of lists to a
RefSeq-based reference list to statistically determine whether
speciﬁc classiﬁcation categories are over- or underrepresented, using the Bonferroni method to adjust for multiple testing.
Statistical analysis
CN data was mapped to the human genome sequence hg18
freeze and log2 intensity ratios were segmented using circular
binary segmentation to translate noisy intensity measurements into regions of equal CN (22). The median absolute
deviation (MAD), scaled by the factor 1.4826, of the difference
between the observed and segmented values was used to
estimate the sample-speciﬁc experimental variation. Outlier
probes were identiﬁed as those which were more than 4
sample-speciﬁc MAD away from their segment value. For each
sample, a segment was declared gained or lost if the segment
value was more than 2 times the sample MAD from the median
segment value of the autosomes. Y chromosome probes were

excluded. Probe-wise frequency plots of CN alterations were
based on gain/loss/normal status.
Probes in which CN aberrations were signiﬁcantly
associated with one group versus another were identiﬁed
based on segment values with original log2 ratios for outlier
probes and using moderated t statistics as implemented
in the limma package (23) in Bioconductor (24). Q values
were computed from the nominal P values to adjust for
multiple testing by controlling the false discovery rate (25). A
Q value cutoff of 0.05 or less was used to declare a probe to
be signiﬁcant.
For the AR gene aberration analysis all 20 probes mapping to the AR gene had the same CN status for all samples
(copy normal or ampliﬁed). These AR probes were excluded
when carrying out probe-wise tests of association of CN
with AR and also when testing association of chromosomal
arms with AR. The sample proﬁles were clustered using
gain, loss, and copy-normal status encoded as 1, 1, and 0,
respectively. Hierarchical clustering was done as discussed
above.
To analyze the correlation between gene expression and CN,
each expression probe was mapped to the closest CN probe.
Only expression probes which were less than 50 kb from the
closest CN probe and in which there were 5 or more samples
with CN aberration, identiﬁed as having absolute CN segment
value greater than 0.3, were considered. A Spearman correlation coefﬁcient was computed for each probe. P values, calculated using asymptotic t approximation, identiﬁed signiﬁcant correlations for a precompiled candidate list of genes
involved in androgen and phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase
(PI3K) signaling (Supplementary Table S1). Q values, computed
to correct for multiple testing, identiﬁed signiﬁcant correlations for noncandidate genes. P and Q values cutoffs 0.05 or less
were, respectively, considered signiﬁcant.
All analyses were done using R software in the UCSF
Biostatistics Core. The aCGH and methylation microarray data
have been deposited in National Center for Biotechnology
Information Gene Expression Omnibus (ref. 26; accession no.
GSE34174).

lines represent the centromeres.

Validation of copy number gains and losses
The CN of 2 candidate genes, AR and PTEN, was assayed
using a TaqMan PCR assay. These genes were selected because
both have been shown to be ampliﬁed (AR) or deleted (PTEN)
in prostate cancer, both were frequently aberrant in the
metastatic aCGH analysis (AR, 73%; PTEN 87%), and both are
present at normal CN in available controls (15). One metastatic
sample harboring AR copy gain and one harboring PTEN
deletion as determined by aCGH were selected (Fig. 2).
For the metastatic sample, the mean aCGH log2 ratio across
all probes in the AR gene was 3.41 (range: 2.65–4.08), corresponding to a mean gain of 11 copies per cell. By PCR, this
sample had 8 copies (range: 7.65–9.17) per cell (Fig. 2A and B).
Similarly, the mean aCGH log2 ratio across all probes in the
PTEN gene for the selected sample was 2.11 (range: 0.54 to
2.73), indicating deletion of one or both copies per cell. By
PCR, this sample had 0.55 copies (range: 0.54–0.6), corresponding to heterozygous PTEN deletion with some evidence of both
copies being lost (Fig. 2C and D).

Results
Oligonucleotide aCGH
Overall, 217,960 (92.8%) probes had a CN aberration (gain or
loss) in at least one of the 15 metastatic samples. Speciﬁcally,
119,405 (50.84%) probes had ampliﬁcation and 180,372 (76.8%)
probes had deletion in 1 or more samples. The absolute log2
ratio for copy change relative to the control ranged from 6.41
(homozygous loss) for AK054947 on chromosome 6, to þ5.88
(gain of 59 copies) for KIF4A, located 2.56 Mb downstream of
AR on chromosome X.
Figure 1 shows the probe-wise frequency of CN changes
across the entire genome for all metastatic samples. A frequency value of 66% or more (i.e., 10 of the samples) was set
to identify commonly ampliﬁed or deleted probes. After ﬁltering out probes in intergenic regions, 495 unique genes (79
ampliﬁed and 416 deleted) met this frequency cutoff (Gene list,
Supplementary Table S2).

Correlation of copy number results with expression
Of the 495 commonly aberrant genes identiﬁed by aCGH, 318
(64%) were both represented on the expression array and had
available expression data. After inclusion of candidate genes
involved in androgen and P13K signaling and correction for
multiple testing for noncandidate genes, 77 genes were identiﬁed which had a signiﬁcant correlation of gene CN to
expression (Spearman correlation range: 0.5–0.89, Q < 0.05,
Gene list, Supplementary Table S1).
We next investigated whether CN aberrations in these
correlated genes were present in unmatched primary tumors,
and if so, whether the aberrations were associated with recurrence after prostatectomy. A higher prevalence of CN aberrations was observed for the correlated genes in recurrent cases
(26.8%, N ¼ 14 recurrent cases) than for nonrecurrent tumors
(17%, N ¼ 22 nonrecurrent cases, Fisher's exact test, P < 0.001).
This comparison held for the entire 495 copy aberrant gene set,

with 26.1% of genes aberrant in the recurrent group compared
with 15.5% in the nonrecurrent group (P < 0.001).
The most common copy gains and losses, deﬁned by a
frequency 66% or more occurred on 6 speciﬁc chromosomes
(6, 8, 10, 13, 16, and X). Mapping of correlated genes (CN and
expression) was done to evaluate whether focused regions of
alteration could be identiﬁed for these commonly aberrant
chromosomes and, in so doing, identify potential "driver"
genes, whose expression correlates with their tumor genomic
copy status, from potential "passenger" genes, whose expression levels do not. This proved to be most useful on chromosome 8 (Fig. 3).
Genomics of AR ampliﬁcation
Because AR overexpression is key to CRPC growth and
because AR ampliﬁcation and expression were signiﬁcantly
correlated (P ¼ 0.03), the degree of genomic AR ampliﬁcation
was investigated. AR ampliﬁcation was present in 11 of 15
(73%) of the metastatic samples. Across the 20 AR microarray
probes, the average log2 ratio for copy gain was 1.7 in the

www.aacrjournals.org

AR-ampliﬁed subset compared with 0.16 in the remaining 4
samples (referred to as AR copy normal). Overall, the maximum AR log2 ratio detected for a single probe was 4.08,
corresponding to 17 AR gene copies per cell.
To further explore the differences between AR copy-normal
and AR-ampliﬁed samples, genome topography plots were
constructed for each subset (Fig. 4). Despite the small sample
size, it is evident that AR-ampliﬁed samples have a higher
overall frequency of ampliﬁcation across their entire tumor
genome, with 66% or more of samples having copy gain in
chromosomes 7q, 8q, and X. Between the 2 groups there was no
signiﬁcant difference in arm-wise chromosomal deletions, and
no single probe was found to be signiﬁcantly different after
correction for multiple testing.
It is plausible that the AR copy-normal tumors have activated the AR pathway by means other than AR ampliﬁcation,
thus a supervised analysis was undertaken to investigate the
CN of 197 genes that regulate AR signaling (27). Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) and PTEN, considered to have a role in AR
regulation, were deleted and underexpressed in both cohorts.

of primary tumors which subsequently recurred biochemically,
compared with 9% of nonrecurrent tumors (Fisher's exact test,
P ¼ 0.36); AR was not ampliﬁed in any primary prostate tumors.

Fraction

Four genes were found to have discordant copy status between
the 2 AR groups. Ampliﬁcation of the AR coactivator NCOA2
was signiﬁcantly associated (P ¼ 0.002) with the presence of AR
ampliﬁcation, whereas deletion of large tumor suppressor,
homolog 2 (LATS2) and pleiomorphic adenoma gene-like 1
(PLAG1) were detected in 75% of AR copy-normal samples, but
in none of the AR-ampliﬁed tumors. DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog,
subfamily C, member 3 (DNAJC3) was found to be deleted in all
AR copy-normal samples, but in only 36% of AR-ampliﬁed
samples.

methylation was 0.64 (0.59–0.68) compared with 0.58 for benign
tissue.
For the metastases, 9,217 probes (33.4%) were methylated in
at least one sample. The average number of methylated probes
per patient was 4,744 (17.2%, range: 3,522–6,388). Of all 27,578
CpG sites assayed, there were 1,361 sites (4.9%) that were
methylated across all samples, corresponding to 1,133 different
genes (7.3% of all genes on the array, Supplementary Table S3).
Hierarchical clustering was done to establish a comprehensive methylation signature of metastatic CRPC. Figure 5A
shows that the majority of probes (blue) are unmethylated.
After subtracting probes with identical methylation status
across all samples, there were 513 probes which showed
differential methylation among the samples (Fig. 5B). Two
different patterns of CpG methylation emerged, with the
majority of samples having a mixed methylation phenotype
(hyper and hypomethylated) and a subset of samples
(Met29_23M, 25_46M, and 12_6M) evincing a hypomethylated
phenotype relative to the rest. This hypomethylated set did not
segregate by clinical factors (Gleason score, PSA at diagnosis,
time from diagnosis to death, and type of therapy received) nor
by pathologic–genomic factors (metastatic site, whole-genome
CN, and AR ampliﬁcation status). Three classes of genes were
unmethylated in this subset whereas methylated in more than
90% of the other samples, including the homeobox genes
(HOXC11, HOXD3, HOXB2, and HOXD4), 2 PI3K isoforms
(PIK3CG and PIK3CD), as well as 4 kallikrein isoforms, (KL,
KLK1, KLK4, and KLK5).

Genes frequently structurally and epigenetically altered
were then mapped into pathways and the overlap explored.
Overall, the gene sets mapped to 3 common pathways: androgen biosynthesis (3 of 20 CN genes, P ¼ 0.006; 8 of 20
methylation genes, P ¼ 0.004), the p53 pathway (6 of 113 CN
genes, P ¼ 0.01; 24 of 113 methylation genes, P ¼ 0.008), and the
IGF1-protein kinase B signaling cascade (4 of 89 CN genes, P ¼
0.035; 19 of 89 methylation genes, P ¼ 0.04).

Integrated analysis of methylation with copy number
An analysis was undertaken to compare the frequency of
methylation to the frequency of gene CN in the metastatic
samples and describe their interaction. Methylation occurred
at a much higher rate (10.5% of all genes on the methylation
array) than common CN changes (2.1% of all genes on the CN
array). Seventy of the 416 commonly deleted genes (35%) had
concurrent methylation in 1 or more samples. Overall 16 genes
including the tumor suppressor RB1 were found to have
methylation and copy loss occurring together in the same
tumor in 66% or more of samples.

Genomics and site of metastasis
To investigate whether structural, epigenetic, and/or transcriptional changes play a role in determining the site of
metastatic spread, hierarchical clustering of samples was
carried out individually for CN, methylation, and expression.
Neither CN, methylation nor expression separated the samples
by metastatic site (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S1).

Genomics of the androgen biosynthesis pathway
Both the CN and the methylation gene sets were signiﬁcantly
enriched for genes responsible for androgen synthesis and
metabolism. Three of 20 genes in this pathway, HSD17B2,
HSDL1, and LIPF, were both simultaneously copy lost and
methylated in the promoter region. Of the gene set immediately involved in testosterone synthesis, methylation of CpG
sites in the gene body of both CYP17A1 and HSD17B3 was
observed (Fig. 6). AR was unmethylated at all 11 CpG sites
investigated.
Genomics of p53/IGF-1/protein kinase B signaling
cascade
The p53 pathway and the IGF-1/protein kinase B signaling
cascade pathways share a number of similar aberrant genes,
including deletion of PTEN and methylation within the gene
body and promoter of multiple subcomponents of the PI3
kinase as well as promoter methylation of AKT3. Two tumor
suppressors in the p53 pathway, RB1 and TNFRSF10C, were
found to be both deleted as well as exhibit promoter
methylation.

TMPRSS2-ERG and TMPRSS2-ETS2 mapping
Genomic alterations involving TMPRSS2, ERG, and ETS2
were previously reported in 8 of these 15 samples (29). Because

these genes are found in close proximity on chromosome 21,
high-resolution mapping of this locus was done to explore
whether the deletion of intergenomic DNA between TMPRSS2
and ERG or ETS2 and speciﬁc breakpoints in these regions
were detectable using aCGH.
In total, genomic deletions in this region were detectable in
12 of the 15 samples assessed, including the 8 detected previously by FISH (Fig. 7), one which harbored only a small
deletion in TMPRSS2, and 3 additional samples which harbored deletion of the entire genomic segment that included
TMPRSS2, ERG, and ETS2. Most of the intergenic deletions
encompass ETS and introns 1–3 of ERG. Of note, ETS2 was
unmethylated in all samples, TMPRSS2 promoter methylation
was present in 1 sample, and ERG promoter methylation was
present in 6 samples. No clear correlation of ERG methylation
and other genomic aberrations was found. More detailed
information about the aCGH and methylation results is in
Supplementary Table S4.

Discussion
In this study, a high-resolution integrated analysis of structural and epigenetic changes was done on metastatic CRPC
tumors. Although small, the sample set is a rare resource for
which whole-genome analysis can provide insight into the
lethal form of prostate cancer. Multiple lines of evidence
support the copy changes observed. First, many of the common
copy changes observed, including AR gain and loss of PTEN
and RB1 are consistent with those reported in previous studies
(8, 30, 31). Second, a novel PCR-based tool was used to
qualitatively conﬁrm the CN aberrations observed, showing
for the ﬁrst time the feasibility and application of this speciﬁc

622

Cancer Res; 72(3) February 1, 2012

approach for validating genomic changes observed with largescale arrays. Further work is needed to determine the quantitative accuracy of this approach. Third, the gene set identiﬁed
as commonly aberrant in these metastatic samples was more
frequently aberrant in a separate set of primary prostate
tumors which recurred after surgery compared with those
that did not recur. Lastly, mapping of the locus of deletion
between TMPRSS2 and ETS2 was consistent with prior FISH
results in this sample set (29) and also shows the usefulness of
high-resolution aCGH in mapping speciﬁc intrachromosomal
translocation breakpoints.
AR ampliﬁcation was common, and AR expression correlated strongly with copy change (Spearman correlation 0.53,
Q ¼ 0.05). When compared with AR-unampliﬁed tumors, ARampliﬁed tumors were found to commonly carry coampliﬁcations of broad areas along chromosomes 7, 8, and X. Among
these, ampliﬁcation of the AR coactivator and putative oncogene NCOA2 was signiﬁcantly associated (P ¼ 0.002) with the
presence of AR ampliﬁcation. NCOA2 ampliﬁcation has been
reported to be ampliﬁed in 17% of metastatic tumors; in this
study it was ampliﬁed in 60% of samples (8). This difference
could be due to different statistical methods used to analyze
aCGH or the relatively small sample sizes in each study. It has
been suggested that AR and NCOA2 genes cooperate in early
prostate cancer (32); however, it seems likely that tumors ﬁrst
acquire NCOA2 ampliﬁcation along with broad ampliﬁcations
on chromosome 8q. Work by us and others has shown gain of
8q to be a common event but AR gain rare in primary tumors
(33). NCOA2-ampliﬁed tumors may then be essentially
"primed" for increased androgen responsiveness, which occurs
once AR becomes ampliﬁed at a later time point. An examination of either metastatic castration-sensitive or newly castration-resistant tumors would help further deﬁne this evolution and could potentially aid in identifying patients more or
less likely respond to AR-targeted therapies.
Although 4 patients in this study lacked AR ampliﬁcation,
they nonetheless died of metastatic CRPC. Although no single
gene was uniquely ampliﬁed in this subset, statistically significant losses were observed in genes critical to the repression of
AR activity. Speciﬁcally, 3 putative tumor suppressors were
deleted including LATS2, a negative regulator of AR (34),
PLAG1, a transcription factor thought to function as a repressor of AR transcriptional activity (35), and DNAJC3, which
codes for the c-subunit of the HSP40 complex which prevents
nuclear AR translocation (36). Loss of any of these genes is
postulated to derepress AR activity and lead to increased ARmediated signaling, thereby potentially conferring a selective
tumor growth advantage that could occur in the absence of
AR gene ampliﬁcation. These cases also raise the possibility
that the progression of tumors without AR ampliﬁcation may
nevertheless be driven by aberrations of AR signaling as
opposed to completely AR-independent pathways. Further
study is needed to see whether this observation holds in larger
sample sets.
Although gene ampliﬁcation and deletion have been
described as mechanisms of genomic change in CRPC, relatively little is known about CpG methylation and its effect on
the development and progression of this disease. Here, for the

Structural and Epigenetic Changes in CRPC

samples with interstitial alterations for this locus are shown. A log2 ratio of 0 is normal CN. More detailed information is provided in Supplementary Table S4.

ﬁrst time, a comprehensive methylation signature of metastatic CRPC is established (Fig. 5) using a high-resolution array.
Overall, the results show that whereas the majority of probes
are unmethylated, CRPC is slightly hypermethylated compared
with benign tissue. This hypermethylation occurs at individual
CpG loci, both within and outside the context of CpG islands.
Whether CRPC is globally hypo- or hypermethylated relative to
earlier prostate tumors is not established in this study.
Although methylation signatures appeared similar for the
majority of samples, at least 3 samples (Mets 29_23, 25_46, and
12_6) were hypomethylated. These tumors did not differ by
clinical or pathologic characteristics nor by the CN or methylation status of the DNA methyltransferase gene (DNMT).
Three classes of genes were differentially methylated between
these 2 methylation subsets, including homeobox genes implicated in tumorigenesis (37), PI3K isoforms known to be
involved in protein translation (38), as well as multiple kallikrein isoforms, proteases implicated in tumor invasion and
metastasis, of which PSA is a member (39). Whether these
methylation changes would inﬂuence response to therapies,
including inhibitors of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and/or serve as biomarkers for response to other therapies is worthy of future
investigation.
Hierarchical clustering by CN, expression (Supplementary
Fig. S1), and methylation (Fig. 5) was unable to establish a
genomic signature of a liver or a soft-tissue metastasis. The
ﬁnding that tumors do not cluster by tissue type is in concor-

www.aacrjournals.org

dance with work showing that metastatic prostate tumors
have monoclonal origins (7). Although multiple genomic
changes must occur to allow a tumor cell to metastasize to
a distant site, the clustering in this study implies that for a
metastatic tumor, few if any speciﬁc CN or methylation
changes are needed to allow it to establish itself in liver tissue
compared with soft tissue. Whether this is true of other
metastatic sites including bone is not known. The small sample
size and large number of comparisons with whole-genome
data may miss small, consistent changes across tumors. Further study is needed in larger metastatic sets to determine the
gene(s)/mechanism(s) that program a cancer cell to hone to a
particular organ.
Integrating the CN and methylation analyses, it was found
that CpG methylation occurs more frequently for genes commonly deleted than for those commonly ampliﬁed. The observation that CN and methylation work in concert more frequently for genes deleted than for those ampliﬁed suggests that
gene silencing may occur through heterozygous loss of one
allele and CpG methylation of the remaining allele. This
cooperation may be essential for inhibiting expression of
critical tumor suppressors, such as RB1, which was both
frequently deleted and methylated in CRPC. This points to
CpG methylation as a possible therapeutic target in CRPC, for
which there are already available hypomethylating agents (e.g.,
5-azacytidine). More work fully dissecting the functional signiﬁcance of the commonly observed epigenetic and structural

changes is needed, and control tumors of earlier stage and
consistent grade will help identify which epigenetic and structural changes occur early or late in the development of CRPC.
Intracrine androgen signaling is implicated in prostate
cancer progression (11), and the integrated analysis here
suggests that methylation and CN changes may occur concurrently to both promote the local production and inhibit local
breakdown of potent androgens (Fig. 6). Recent work suggests
that promoter methylation reduces gene transcription, whereas gene body methylation increases transcription (40–42).
Thus, as a hypothesis generating exercise in the absence of
expression data for these genes, methylation of CpG sites in
gene promoters was interpreted as reducing gene transcription, whereas methylation of gene body CpGs was interpreted
as increasing transcription. With this interpretation, we posit
that despite almost half of the metastatic tumors exhibiting
heterozygous deletion of CYP17A1, a gene critical to androgen
synthesis and the target of multiple inhibitors currently in
clinical trials (43, 44), tumors are nonetheless able to upregulate CYP17A1 through methylation of CpG sites in the gene
body. Resistance to CYP17A1 inhibitors may be epigenetically
mediated, and this clinically suggests that resistance to
CYP17A1 inhibitors could be attenuated through the use of
hypomethylating agents.
This genomic study, which to the best of our knowledge
includes the most comprehensive methylation analysis of

metastatic CRPC, presents evidence of speciﬁc pathway biomarkers that may be useful for assessment of prognosis and
stratiﬁcation for therapy if validated in larger clinical study
sets. Furthermore, these observations suggest that the application of agents targeting genes both structurally and epigenetically altered may delay the progression of castrationresistant disease.
