BACKGROUND. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of adding
chronic, intermittent, low-dose vinorelbine to gefitinib treatment for patients
who had adenocarcinoma of the lung who failed 2 regimens of chemotherapy.

METHODS. Patients were randomized into 2 arms: Oral gefitinib 250 mg daily (the
G arm) or vinorelbine 15 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion on Day 1 and oral
gefitinib 250 mg daily on Days 2 through 14 every 2 weeks (the GV arm). From
August 2004 to October 2005, 48 patients were enrolled. Epidermal growth factor

response rates were 55.6% in the G arm and 52.4% in the GV arm. All toxicities in
both arms were mild. The 1-year progression-free survival rate was 57.1% in the
GV arm and 21.2% in the G arm (P ¼ .008). The median survival was 13.3 months
in the G arm and 23.4 months in the GV arm (P ¼ .1231). Three of 6 patients
(50%) had an exon 19 in-frame deletion, and 2 of 10 patients had EGFR gene
high polysomy or amplification (20%).

CONCLUSIONS. Gefitinib was highly effective in ethnic Chinese patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung who failed previous platinum and taxane treatment.
The addition of low-dose vinorelbine every 2 weeks produced a significantly
better 1-year progression-free survival rate. Cancer 2007;109:1821–8.  2007

efitinib (Iressa; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, Del) is
a selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EFGR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). It is an orally active agent for advanced
nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients who have failed on a
previous platinum-based regimen and taxane treatment.1–3 In 2 large
Phase II trials (the Iressa Dose Evaluation in Advanced Lung Cancer
[IDEAL] 1 study and the IDEAL 2 study), the results indicated that
gefitinib had a substantial effect as a salvage treatment for patients
who had failed at least 1 or 2 previous regimens of chemotherapy.1,2
Results from the IDEAL 1 study indicated that Japanese
patients had a better response to gefitinib treatment than Cauca-

sian patients; and results from another study, the
Iressa Survival Evaluation in Lung Cancer, indicated
that East Asian patients had better response and
survival than Caucasian patients and patients who
received placebo treatment.4 Once it was determined that the EGFR mutation occurred more frequently in East Asian patients than in Caucasians
and that patients who had an EGFR mutation had a
better response to gefitinib treatment, researchers
understood why gefitinib had better efficacy in East
Asian patients than in Caucasians.5–8 In a previous
study at our hospital, the investigators reported an
EGFR tyrosine kinase mutation/deletion rate of
approximately 61% in patients with available specimens.9
Whether or not the combined use of chemotherapeutic agent(s) and gefitinib has an additive or
synergistic effect is an interesting issue that has been
explored continuously in recent years. Large-scale,
randomized Phase III studies of first-line combination use of doublet chemotherapy with gefitinib have
taken place but have produced negative results.10,11
Scagliotti et al.12 performed a prospective study combining gefitinib with single-agent gemcitabine (1200
mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks) or vinorelbine (30 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks) in
elderly patients with NSCLC. Those authors reported
that vinorelbine plus gefitinib was too toxic to be tolerated by their patients. However, the response rate
and median survival were higher for those patients
who received vinorelbine plus gefitinib treatment.12
In addition, a subset analysis of nonsmokers who
received carboplatin/paclitaxel with or without erlotinib (another TKI) in the Tarceva Responses in Conjunction with Paclitaxel and Carboplatin (TRIBUTE)
study revealed a markedly greater survival benefit for
nonsmokers who received chemotherapy plus erlotinib compared with nonsmokers who received chemotherapy alone (median 22.5 months vs 10 months;
P ¼ .01).13,14
When developing a new anticancer drug, an important Phase II objective is to identify the most
appropriate target population for a subsequent Phase
III trial. In the past, a target population generally was
characterized by disease stage and primary site. With
molecular targeting drugs, often, this no longer is
adequate. Based on the relative good toxicity profiles
and high activity observed in our previous Phase II
study of treatment with gefitinib alone,15 we decided
to conduct a Phase II randomized trial using gefitinib
with or without low-dose vinorelbine treatment in
ethnic Chinese patients with adenocarcinoma of the
lung who failed on previous chemotherapy. Our
objective was to investigate whether or not adding

vinorelbine to gefitinib treatment would improve the
time to disease progression and survival status in a
specified group of patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was conducted according to existing rules
for good clinical practice, and the study protocol was
approved by the local ethics committee. Patients
with adenocarcinoma of the lung who had failed 2
regimens, including taxanes and platinum-based
chemotherapy, were entered into the study after they
provided informed consent. Eligibility criteria included a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of stage IV
adenocarcinoma of the lung in patients who had
failed previous chemotherapy with 2 regimens (including taxanes and platinum-based chemotherapy);
clinically measurable disease, which was defined as
bidimensionally measurable lesions; no previous
radiotherapy directed at the on measurable lesion(s);
adequate bone marrow reserve with a white blood
cell count 4000/mm3, platelets 100,000/mm3, and
hemoglobin 10 g/dL; and a life expectancy of
>2 months. Patients with inadequate liver function
(total bilirubin >1.5 times the upper limit of normal
and alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels
>3 times the upper limit of normal) or inadequate
renal function with creatinine levels >2 mg/dL were
excluded from the study.
Baseline evaluations included the patient’s history, a physical examination, and a performance score.
A complete blood cell count, urinalysis, serum biochemistry profile, electrocardiogram, chest roentgenography, whole-body bone scan, brain computed
tomography (CT) scan, and chest (including the liver
and adrenal glands) CT scans also were obtained.
Eligible patients were randomized to receive either gefitinib treatment (G arm) or gefitinib plus
vinorelbine treatment (GV arm). All patients in the G
arm received gefitinib at a fixed daily oral dose of
250 mg. All patients in the GV arm received vinorelbine (15 mg/m2) on Day 1 and gefitinib at a fixed
daily oral dose of 250 mg on Days 2 through 14 every
2 weeks. Concomitant use of other chemotherapeutic
agents was not allowed. Palliative radiotherapy to the
measurable lesion was not used. Treatment was
given until patients developed disease progression or
of intolerable toxicity.
With regard to dose modifications, gefitinib was
stopped temporarily for 1 or 2 weeks if the patient
suffered from grade 3 toxicity; gefitinib could be
restarted from a 50% dose once the toxicity was
reduced to grade 2, except in patients with drug-

Gefitinib Alone or With Vinorelbine/Chen et al.

induced pneumonitis, who stopped the treatment
permanently. A subsequent dose escalation to the
original level was allowed provided that the patient
tolerated the doses given at the 50% level. Vinorelbine was omitted and replaced with 250 mg gefitinib
if the absolute neutrophil count was <1 3 109/L, the
platelet count was <75 3 109/L on the day of vinorelbine injection, or if the patient refused the vinorelbine injection.
Subsequent complete blood cell counts and serum biochemistry studies were obtained 2 weeks after the beginning of gefitinib treatment and every 4
weeks thereafter for every patient. In addition, a
complete blood cell count was checked every 2
weeks in the GV arm. Drug-related adverse events
and toxicities were recorded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute
(version 2.0). The Lung Cancer Symptom Scale was
recorded before treatment, every month thereafter,
and when the patient completed or went off the
study.
Evaluation of response was performed after 4
weeks of treatment and every 8 weeks thereafter.
Types of responses were assessed with the use of
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST).16 Responding patients and patients with
stable disease continued treatment until they developed disease progression.
This study was designed to enroll at least 20
qualified patients in each arm. This calculation
assumed that the true 1-year progression-free survival rate for the best treatment was 10% better
than the rate for the other treatments. We assumed
that the smaller 1-year progression-free survival
rate was 5% and that the higher rate was 15%, with
a power of 0.85 and a P value of 0.05, and that each
treatment group required 20 qualified patients.17
Survival was measured from administration of the
first dose until the date of death or last follow-up.
For statistical analysis, the Kaplan-Meier method
with a log-rank test was used for univariate survival
analysis. For multivariate survival analysis of all 48
patients, a Cox regression analysis was performed
that included the variables sex, performance status,
current treatment as third-line or later, smoking,
response or no response to current treatment, response or no response to first-line chemotherapy,
response or no response to last-line chemotherapy,
skin rash, diarrhea, paronychia, and treatment with
or without vinorelbine. For the statistical analysis of
the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale, the Mann-Whitney test was used for a comparison of the 2 treatment arms, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was
used for comparison before and after treatment.

1823

The SPSS statistical software program was used for
the analyses.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies for
EGFR gene copy numbers were performed using the
EGFR/chromsome 7 centromere (CEP7) dual-color
probes (Vysis, Downer’s Grove, Ill) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Hybridization occurred
with the orange EGFR probe and the green CEP7
probe. Specimens that measured 3 or 4 lm thick
were placed on silane-coated slides; then, they were
baked at 568C for 2 hours, deparaffinized, pretreated
(1 M sodium thiocyanate in 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0),
and digested with pepsin (Sigma-P7012) (4 mg/mL
in 0.9% NaCl solution, pH 2.0) for approximately 12
to 14 minutes, and fixed (in 10% buffered formalin)
and denatured in solution (formamide, 20 3 standard saline citrate, and H2O at 7:1:2 dilution, pH 7.0–
7.5) for 5 minutes. After dehydration with 70%, 85%,
and 100% ethanol, specimens were hybridized overnight at 378C. The definition of EGFR gene amplification or high polysomy was based on that reported by
Cappuzzo et al.18
EGFR mutation analysis was performed with nucleotide sequence analysis. The VarientSEQr Resequencing Primer Set (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, Calif) was selected for mutational analysis of
the tyrosine kinase domain: exons 18 through 21 of
the EGFR gene. DNA was extracted, exons 18 through
21 were amplified, and uncloned polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) fragments were sequenced and analyzed in both sense and antisense directions for the
presence of heterozygous mutations. All sequence
variants were confirmed by multiple, independent
PCR amplifications, and forward and reverse sequencing reactions were done. Each 10-lL PCR reaction
contained 10 ng of DNA, 1 lL HotStar buffer (with
1.5 mM MgCl2), 1 lL nucleotide triphosphates, 0.1 U
HotStarTaq polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif), and
2 lL primer mix. The PCR program was set at 958C
for 15 minutes, followed by 40 cycles at 948C for 30
seconds, 608C for 45 seconds, 728C for 45 seconds,
and finally 728C for 10 minutes. Sequencing reaction
consisted of diluted PCR products mixed with M13
primer and Big Dye Terminator Mix (Applied Biosystems), followed by electrophoresis in an ABI Prism
3700 DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were analyzed
using SeqScape software (version 2.1; Applied Biosystems). Genomic DNA was derived from formalinfixed and paraffin blocks for mutational analysis of
the EGFR coding sequence. Normal control DNA
provided by ABI was used for wild-type controls. All
the sequence variations were confirmed by multiple,
independent PCR amplifications and repeated sequencing reactions.

RESULTS
From August 2004 to October 2005, 48 patients were
enrolled. Twenty-four patients were randomized into
the GV arm. However, 3 patients refused vinorelbine
treatment and received gefitinib treatment only;
thus, 27 patients received G treatment and 21 patients received GV treatment. Among 21 patients in
the GV arm, vinorelbine was stopped before disease
progression in 4 patients because of port-A occlusion
after 1 injection, 5 injections, 20 injections, and
23 injections, respectively; after 4 injections in 1 patient because of mucositis; and after 7 injections in
another patient because of a persistent sensation of
fatigue.
The mean patient age was 62.7 years in the G
arm and 63 years in the GV arm. All patients had
stage IV lung adenocarcinoma. The clinical characteristics of these patients are listed in Table 1. There
was no statistical difference in the clinical characteristics between patients in the 2 treatment arms in
terms of sex, age, performance status, current treatment as third-line or later treatment, and a history
or no history of smoking. All patients were assessable
for toxicity profile and treatment response.
After 8 weeks of treatment, 15 patients achieved a
partial response (PR) in the G arm (overall response
rate, 55.6%), and 11 patients achieved a PR in the GV
arm (overall response rate, 52.4%; P ¼ .837). Stable
disease (SD) was reported in 6 patients (22.2%) and

7 patients (33.3%) in the G and GV arms, respectively;
and progressive disease was reported in 6 patients
(22.2%) and 3 patients (14.3%), respectively. The
response rate did not correlate with the patients’ performance status in either treatment arm.
After a median follow-up of 18 months, the median
time to disease progression was 7.1 months in the G
arm and 12.8 months in the GV arm (P ¼ .1331). The 1year progression-free survival rate was 21.2% in the G
arm and 57.1% in the GV arm (P ¼ .008) (Fig. 1). The
median survival was 13.3 months in the G arm and
23.4 months in the GV arm (P ¼ .1231) (Fig. 2), and the
1-year survival rates were 51.3% and 75.3%, respectively
(P ¼ .133).

responded to current treatment (P ¼ .0038). Survival
was longer in women, in those patients whose current treatment was third-line, in nonsmokers, in
patients who responded to first-line or last-line
chemotherapy, in patients who had gefitinib side
effects (including skin rash, diarrhea, or paronychia),
and in patients who received vinorelbine treatment;
however, those differences were without statistical
significance (Table 2). The multivariate Cox regression analysis that included sex, treatment arm, performance status, current treatment as third-line or
later, smoking, response or no response to current
treatment, response or no response to first-line treatment, response or no response to last-line treatment,
skin rash, diarrhea, and paronychia showed that only
performance status (P ¼ .0058) and response to current treatment (P ¼ .0468) had statistical significance.
Fourteen patients had pathology samples available for analysis. However, only 6 patients had qualified samples for mutation analysis, and 10 patients
had samples available for EGFR fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) examinations. EGFR FISH and
mutation studies showed that 3 of 6 patients (50%)
had exon 19 in-frame deletions (Glu746-Thr750), and
2 of 10 patients (20%) had EGFR gene amplification.
The 3 patients who had exon 19 deletions did not
have EGFR gene high polysomy or amplification. The
2 patients who had EGFR gene amplification did not
have a mutation analysis performed. Two of 3 patients who had EGFR mutation and both patients
with EGFR gene amplification had a PR to treatment,
with a maximal overall response rate of 80% in
patients who had EGFR mutation or amplification.
All patients who were enrolled on the study were
eligible for toxicity evaluation. The toxicities were
few and were mild in severity in both arms. Only 1
patient in the GV arm suffered from grade 3 leukopenia or neutropenia (Table 3). In terms of nonhemato-

logic toxicities, more patients suffered from a sensation of fatigue (P ¼ .027) in the GV arm than in the G
arm (Table 4). However, toxicities grade 2 were
rare. Only 1 patient in the G arm suffered from grade

steroid treatment.
In total, 45 patients (25 patients in the G arm
and 20 patients in the GV arm) completed the Lung
Cancer Symptom Scale questionnaire at baseline, after 2 months of treatment, and/or after going off
study. The results of the completed Lung Cancer
Symptoms Scale showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the scales between the
G arm and the GV arm, either before treatment, or 2
months after treatment, or when the patient went off
study, and whether the measure was scored by the
patients (9 items) or by the observers (6 items),
including the categories of loss of appetite, fatigue,
cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, pain, disease severity,
daily activity, and quality of life. When all of the treated patients were considered together, there was no
difference in the scores for all items between baseline and 2 months after treatment, except loss of
appetite and fatigue, which had a slight and significant decrease. There was also a slight and significant
decease in the scores for all items except hemoptysis
between baseline and after the patient had gone off
study.

DISCUSSION
Two large, randomized Phase III studies of chemotherapy with or without gefitinib in patients with
advanced chemotherapy-naive NSCLC, known as the
Iressa NSCLC Trial Assessing Combination Treatment
(INTACT) 1 and INTACT 2 trials, were performed to

determine whether or not gefitinib can enhance the
antitumor effect of chemotherapy and, thus, prolong
patient survival more than chemotherapy alone.10,11
In the INTACT 1 study, the chemotherapy regimen
was cisplatin plus gemcitabine at the usual dose and
schedule.10 Patients were assigned randomly to
receive chemotherapy plus a placebo, chemotherapy
plus gefitinib 250 mg daily, or chemotherapy plus
gefitinib 500 mg daily. Surprisingly, the results
demonstrated that there were no differences in response rate, overall survival, or progression-free survival across the 3 treatment arms. In the INTACT 2
trial, a different chemotherapy regimen was used.11
Again, there were no differences in response rate,
overall survival, or progression-free survival across
the 2 treatment arms. The results of those 2 trials
demonstrated that, in patients with chemotherapynaive NSCLC, the addition of gefitinib to conventional chemotherapy does not enhance the clinical
benefit of combination chemotherapy alone. Recently, it has come to light that EGFR TKIs induce
apoptosis in mutant cell lines when they are given
with chemotherapy but result in G1 arrest in EGFR
wild-type tumors19; and, because approximately 50%
to 60% of our patient population carried EGFR mutant tumors,9 the high response rates and prolonged
survival were not surprising. In addition, our patients
received gefitinib on Days 2 through 14 and vinorelbine on Day 1, which effectively achieved pharmacodynamic separation and high response rates even in
our patients with EGFR wild-type tumors; and this
supports the high 40% response rate (1 CR, 3 PRs,
and 3 SD in 10 patients) achieved on a Phase I clinical trial of docetaxel on Day 1 and erlotinib on Days
2 through 16 repeated every 3 weeks.19 Our small
study with an appropriate control arm should make

Gefitinib Alone or With Vinorelbine/Chen et al.

a very important contribution toward justifying the
initiation of large Phase III studies,20,21 because several randomized Phase III studies have produced
negative results when a TKI was added to doublet
chemotherapy.10,11,13
A subset analysis of the paclitaxel/carboplatin
With or Without Erlotinib in Advanced NSCLC study
in the TRIBUTE study showed that nonsmokers had
better survival when they received both chemotherapy and erlotinib treatment compared with chemotherapy alone (median survival, 22.5 months vs 10
months; P ¼ .01).13,14 In the INTACT 2 study, there
was a trend toward improved survival in the subgroup of patients with adenocarcinoma who had
received chemotherapy for 90 days in the gefitinib
250 mg daily arm (P ¼ .05).11 Thus, it is both conceivable and possible that, if only a small proportion
of patients are sensitive to gefitinib or erlotinib, then
the diluting effect of the lack of selection may make
the discerning of small differences in the INTACT,
TRIBUTE, and TALENT studies impossible. A sharper
definition of such susceptible subgroups of patients
certainly will help in the further development of
this type of agent. The selection of Asian patients
with adenocarcinoma who failed 2 chemotherapy
regimens, as in our study, and had no overlapping
schedule of gefitinib and vinorelbine is another quick
way to screen whether or not a new regimen is feasible for further testing.
Although there has been documentation of ineffectiveness of single-agent vinorelbine as salvage
chemotherapy,22 it was 1 of the few chemotherapeutic agents that had not been administered previously to our selected patient group; in addition,
although severe myelosuppression leading to an
unacceptable rate of febrile neutropenia had been
reported in patients on concurrent gefitinib/vinorelbine/cisplatin or gefitinib/vinorelbine, very high
response rates have been reported,12,23 so that lowdose vinorelbine was selected for this clinical trial.
The safety profiles in the current study of gefitinib
plus low-dose vinorelbine were highly tolerable in
our patients. The high efficacy of gefitinib plus
low-dose vinorelbine deserves further attention
and study, because this regimen still was effective
after the patients had failed at least 2 chemotherapy
regimens.
Many patients in the GV arm in our study
stopped vinorelbine treatment before they developed
disease progression. Replacement of intravenous
vinorelbine with oral vinorelbine should be considered in future studies to prevent early stopping of
vinorelbine treatment because of intravenous administration issues.

In our previous chemotherapy study, the Lung
Cancer Symptoms Scale showed a significant decrease in symptom scores, which indicates that disease severity or symptoms had worsened after the
patients had received 2 cycles of chemotherapy.24 In
contrast, the current results indicated that gefitinibbased treatment produced no change in symptom
scores after 2 months of treatment, indicating that
there was better effective prolongation of symptom
deterioration.
In conclusion, the addition of low-dose vinorelbine to gefitinib has shown high efficacy in patients
with adenocarcinoma lung cancer who have failed 2
previous regimens of chemotherapy. Because there
have been 4 negative Phase III randomized trials of
EGFR TKIs with chemotherapy (INTACT 1 and 2,
TRIBUTE, and TALENT), only studies in selected
EGFR mutation-enriched patient populations can be
justified at this time for further clinical trials that
combine chemotherapy with EGFR TKIs.
