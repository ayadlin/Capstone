Abstract

Author Manuscript

Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma
associated with infection by Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV). (+)-JQ1 and IBET151 are two recently described novel small molecule inhibitors of BET bromodomain
chromatin-associated proteins that have shown impressive preclinical activity in cancers in which
MYC is over-expressed at the transcriptional level due to chromosomal translocations that bring
the MYC gene under the control of a super-enhancer. PEL cells, in contrast, lack structural
alterations in the MYC gene, but have deregulated Myc protein due to the activity of KSHVencoded latent proteins. We report that PEL cell lines are highly sensitive to BET bromodomain
inhibitors-induced growth inhibition and undergo G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis and cellular
senescence, but without the induction of lytic reactivation, upon treatment with these drugs.
Treatment of PEL cell lines with BET inhibitors suppressed the expression of MYC and resulted
in a genome-wide perturbation of MYC-dependent genes. Silencing of BRD4 and MYC
expression blocked cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression, while ectopic expression of MYC
from a retroviral promoter rescued cells from (+)-JQ1-induced growth arrest. In a xenograft model
of PEL, (+)-JQ1 significantly reduced tumor growth and improved survival. Taken collectively, our
results demonstrate that the utility of BET inhibitors may not be limited to cancers in which
genomic alterations result in extremely high expression of MYC and they may have equal or
perhaps greater activity against cancers in which the MYC genomic locus is structurally intact and
c-Myc protein is deregulated at the post-translational level and is only modestly over-expressed.

Introduction
Infection with KSHV is the commonest cause of malignancy among patients with AIDS and
one of the commonest causes of malignancies among young adults in many parts of the
world (1-2). The prognosis of KSHV associated PEL is extremely poor with a median
survival of less than 3 months in most reported studies (3-5). Thus, there is an urgent need
for novel molecularly targeted therapies for PEL.

Bromodomains are small evolutionary conserved domains present in many chromatin
associated proteins and almost all nuclear histone acetyltransferases (6-7). These domains
recognize acetylated-lysine residues in histones and regulate protein–protein interactions
involved in chromatin-mediated cellular gene transcription, cell proliferation, and viral
transcriptional activation (6-7). The human genome contains 41 bromodomain proteins that
have been implicated in a wide range of diseases including cancer, inflammation, obesity,
diabetes, infectious diseases and cardiovascular disorders (7). The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) subfamily is represented by BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT and its
members share similar domain structure consisting of two highly conserved amino-terminal
bromodomains. Several recent studies have shown that BRD4 plays a key role in
hematological malignancies (8-11). These studies have been facilitated by the recent
development of small molecule compounds, (+)-JQ1 and I-BET151, which displace BET
bromodomain proteins from chromatin by competitively binding to the acetyl-lysine
recognition pocket in histones (12-13). Thus, pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 by (+)JQ1 and I-BET151 in a mouse model of MLL-fusion induced AML was shown to block
disease progression in vitro and in vivo (9-10). Treatment with BET inhibitors was also
shown to have activity in preclinical models of multiple myeloma and Burktitt's lymphoma
(8, 14). The anti-proliferative effects of BET inhibitors in the above disease models were
associated with a block in the transcription of key oncogenes, most notably MYC, followed
by genome-wide suppression of c-Myc-dependent target genes (8-9, 14). However, since
BRD4 is ubiquitously expressed, it was unclear why its inhibition would result in specific
down-regulation of c-Myc. A recent study addressed this question using the multiple
myeloma cell line MM1.S and reported that BRD4, along with Mediator coactivator
complex, is present at extremely high levels at a small set of exceptionally large enhancers,
called super-enhancers (15). The MM1.S cell line carries an IgH-MYC rearrangement that
places the MYC gene under the control of IgH super-enhancer (15). Treatment of MM1.S
cells with (+)-JQ1 was found to lead to preferential loss of BRD4 and its associated cofactors at super-enhancers and caused preferential loss of transcription at genes associated
with super-enhancers, including the MYC oncogene (15). Based on these results, BET
inhibitors would be expected to have activity primarily against cancers in which the MYC
gene comes under the control of a super-enhancer and is highly over-expressed at the
transcriptional level.
c-Myc has also been shown to be required for proliferation of PEL cells and for maintenance
of KSHV latency (16). However, while MYC is frequently deregulated at the genomic/
transcriptional level in human cancers, including cancers against which BET inhibitors have
shown activity, the MYC genomic locus is structurally intact in PEL (3). Instead, c-Myc is
deregulated in PEL at the post-translational level due to the activity of two KSHV latent

proteins, LANA and vIRF3/LANA2, which enhance the stability of c-Myc and stimulate its
transcriptional activity (17-19). To examine whether BET inhibitors may also have activity
against cancers in which MYC is not up-regulated at the transcriptional level, we examined
their activity against PEL cells. We demonstrate that the utility of BET inhibitors is not
limited to cancers in which genomic alternations bring the MYC genes under the control of a
super-enhancer and these compounds may have equal or greater activity against cancers in
which the MYC genomic locus is structurally intact and c-Myc protein is deregulated at the
post-translational level.

Results
Anti-proliferative effects of (+)-JQ1 on PEL cells lines

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To explore the effect of BRD4 inhibitors on the survival and proliferation of PEL cells, we
treated four PEL-derived cell lines, BC1 (KSHV+/EBV+), BC3 (KSHV+/EBV-), BCBL1
(KSHV+/EBV-), and JSC1 (KSHV+/EBV+) with increasing doses of (+)-JQ1. As shown in
Figure 1a, treatment with increasing doses of (+)-JQ1 for a period of 5 days strongly
reduced the survival of BC1, BC3 and BCBL1 in a dose-dependent manner as measured by
an MTS assay (IC50 = 250 nM, 380 nM, and 380 nM for BC1, BC3, BCBL1, respectively).
(+)-JQ1 also blocked the proliferation of JSC1 cells, albeit at slightly higher doses (IC50 =
790 nM). In contrast, Burkitt's lymphoma-derived Namalwa (KSHV-/EBV+) cells were
relatively resistant to (+)-JQ1 (IC50 = 1130 nM). Treatment with (-)-JQ1, an inactive
enantiomer of (+)-JQ1 (12), had no significant growth inhibitory effect on any of the tested
cell lines (Figure 1a). To further demonstrate the sensitivity of PEL cells to (+)-JQ1, we next
examined its effect on a panel of leukemia and lymphoma cell lines of diverse lineages. The
IC50 of (+)-JQ1 for the non-PEL cell lines in this panel ranged from 820 nM to >5 μM,
which were considerably higher than its IC50 for the PEL cell lines (Table 1). Collectively,
the above results demonstrate that the PEL-derived cell lines are remarkably sensitive to (+)JQ1-induced growth inhibition.
Anti-proliferative effect of I-BET151 on PEL cell lines

Author Manuscript

To next demonstrate that the observed growth inhibitory effect of (+)-JQ1 on PEL cell lines
is a class-effect, we took advantage of I-BET151, a structural analog of JQ1 (10). Treatment
with I-BET151 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the proliferation of all tested cell
lines. However, similar to the results with (+)-JQ1, the IC50 values of I-BET151 for PEL cell
lines (220 nM, 460 nM and 330 nM for BC1, BC3 and BCBL1 cells) were significantly
lower than their IC50 for non-PEL cells (970 nM, 970 nM, 1220 nM, 760 nM and 950 nM
for BJAB, Namalwa, Jurkat, MM1S and U266 cell lines, respectively) (Figure 1b and Table
1). Taken collectively, the above results confirm that PEL cell lines are remarkably sensitive
to BET inhibitors.
Anti-proliferative effects of (+)-JQ1and I-BET151 on UM-PEL-1 and UM-PEL-3 cells
Due to its rarity, many studies on PEL are limited to PEL-derived cell lines that may deviate
from the original tumors seen in the patient due to culture-induced adaptations. To
circumvent this problem, we tested the effect of BET inhibitors on UM-PEL-1 and UMPEL-3 cell models (20-21). These models were established by transferring freshly isolated

human PEL cells into the peritoneal cavities of NOD/SCID mice and have been
subsequently maintained by serial propagation in vivo without in vitro cell growth to avoid
the changes in KSHV gene expression evident in cultured cells (20-21). Treatment with (+)JQ1 inhibited the proliferation of UM-PEL-1 and UM-PEL-3 cells with IC50 values of 130
nM and 220 nM, respectively, while (-)-JQ1 had no inhibitory effect (Figure 1c). Similarly,
I-BET151 blocked the proliferation of UM-PEL-1 and UM-PEL-3 cells with IC50 values of
210 nM and 180 nM, respectively (Figure 1d).
BET inhibitors induce cell cycle arrest in PEL cells

Author Manuscript

To study the mechanism by which BET inhibitors reduce the proliferation of PEL cells, we
examined their effect on cell cycle progression using flow cytometry. Treatment of PEL cells
with (+)-JQ1 for 48 hours resulted in a pronounced reduction in cells in the S phase as
compared to (-)-JQ1-treated cells (Figure 2a and Supplementary Table 3). This was
accompanied by a concomitant increase in cells arrested in the G0/G1 phase (Figure 2a and
Supplementary Table 3). Essentially similar results were obtained upon treatment of BC1
and BC3 cells with I-BET151 (Figure 2b and Supplementary Table 3). In contrast, (+)-JQ1
had no major effect on cell-cycle progression in Namalwa cells (Figure 2a). Thus, BET
inhibitors appear to delay progression of PEL cells into the S phase of the cell cycle,
resulting in G0/G1-growth arrest.
Induction of apoptosis and cellular senescence by (+)-JQ1 in PEL cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The cell-cycle analysis also suggested an increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells upon
(+)-JQ1 treatment, indicating induction of cell death via apoptosis (Figure 2a). Consistent
with it, treatment with (+)-JQ1 for 48 hours resulted in a modest increase in Annexin V+/PI+
cells (Figure 3a). In contrast, no increase in the Annexin V+/PI+ fraction was seen upon
treatment of JSC1 and Namalwa cells with (+)-JQ1 (Figure 3a). A dose-response experiment
demonstrated the dose-dependency of apoptosis induction in response to (+)-JQ1-treatment
in BC1 and BCBL1 cells, but not in Namalwa cells (Figure S1a). We also evaluated the
effect of increasing doses of (+)-JQ1 on the alterations in the expression of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins. We did not observe a significant increase in the cleavage of PARP or
down-regulation of Mcl-1 upon treatment with (+)-JQ1 in BC1, BCBL1 and Namalwa cells
(Figure S1b). A modest reduction in Bcl-xL expression was seen upon treatment of BC1
cells with increasing doses of (+)-JQ1, but was not seen in BCBL1 and Namalwa cells
(Figure S1b). We also evaluated the effect of JQ1 on cellular senescence. PEL cells were
treated with (+)-JQ1 and subsequently stained with β-galactosidase, a marker for cellular
senescence. Consistent with their relative sensitivity to (+)-JQ1-mediated growth inhibition,
BC1, BC3 and BCBL1 cells showed strong β-galactosidase staining following (+)-JQ1
treatment, while JSC1 and Namalwa cells showed weak to no increase in staining,
respectively (Figure 3b). The increase in β-galactosidase staining in BC1, BC3 and BCBL1
cells was accompanied by up-regulation of p27 (Figure 3c), a known marker of cellular
senescence (22). As a control, we also evaluated the effect of (-)-JQ1 on induction of
apoptosis and cellular senescence in PEL cells and observed no significant effect (Figure
S2). Taken together, treatment of PEL cells with BET inhibitors results in a phenotype of
reduced proliferation, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, mild increase in apoptosis and induction of
cellular senescence.

Analysis of differential gene expression in PEL following JQ1 treatment

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To test the effect of BET inhibition on gene transcription, BC1, BCBL1 and JSC1 cells were
treated with (+)-JQ1 (500 nM) for 8 hours followed by genome-wide transcriptome analysis
using Illumina's RNA-Seq platform. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering separated samples
according to their treatment group, indicating a common transcriptional response to
treatment with (+)-JQ1 (Figure 4a). Rather than inducing non-specific changes in gene
expression, (+)-JQ1 induced significant changes in a limited number of genes. Thus, there
were 350 genes (229 down- and 129 up-regulated genes) whose expression was changed ≥2
fold in all three cell lines. We used a GSEA program to identify functional gene sets whose
expression changed significantly with (+)-JQ1 treatment in PEL cells (23). For this purpose,
we focused on gene sets containing genes co-regulated in response to genetic and chemical
perturbations. Among the top gene signatures identified by this analysis were two gene sets
(BENPORATH_MYC_MAX_TARGETS and DANG_BOUND_BY_MYC) containing
genes that are known targets of Myc (Figure 4b).

We used qRT-PCR to confirm down-regulation of MYC by (+)-JQ1 in PEL cell lines. we
observed significant reduction in MYC expression in BC1, BC3, BCBL1 and JSC1 cells
following exposure to (+)-JQ1 as compared to the (-)-JQ1-treated cells (Figure 5a). In
contrast, (+)-JQ1 had no significant inhibitory effect on MYC expression in the Namalwa
cells (Figure 5a). We also observed a dose-dependent decline in c-Myc protein expression in
BC1, BC3 and BCBL1 cells (Figure 5b), which was associated with depletion of chromatinbound c-Myc, as measured by an ELISA-based DNA-binding assay (Figure 5c). The
baseline level of c-Myc protein was higher in JSC1 cells as compared to the other PEL cell
lines and its significant residual expression was observed in the (+)-JQ1-treated cells (Figure
5b), which probably contributed to their reduced sensitivity to the drug in the MTS assay
(Table 1). Additional support for the hypothesis that the level of c-Myc is a key determinant
of response to (+)-JQ1 was provided by studies on Namalwa cells, which are relatively
resistant to (+)-JQ1 (IC50=1130 nM) (Table 1). The basal level of c-Myc was significantly
higher in Namalwa cell as compared to the PEL cell lines and remained higher following
treatment with (+)-JQ1 (Figure 5b). A close correlation between the response to BET
inhibitors and c-Myc level was also observed in experiments involving treatment with IBET151. As shown in Figure 5d, I-BET151 resulted in a dose-dependent decline in c-Myc
protein levels in the BC1 and BC3 cell lines. However, similar to Namalwa cells, the basal
level of c-Myc in the I-BET151-resistant Jurkat cells was relatively high as compared to the
PEL cell lines and was not significantly affected by treatment with the drug (Figure 5d).
Collectively, the above results support the hypothesis that the level of c-Myc is a key
determinant of response to BET inhibitors.
Finally, we used qRT-PCR analysis to examine the effect of (+)-JQ1 on the expression of
two known downstream MYC target genes, MYB and TERT. We also included TYRO3, a
gene known to be down-regulated by (+)-JQ1, in the analysis (8). (+)-JQ1 resulted in
significant reduction in the expression of MYB and TERT in BC1, BC3, BCBL1 and JSC1
cell lines and significant reduction in TYRO3 expression in BC1, BC3, and BCBL1 cell

lines as compared to (-)-JQ1-treated cells (Figure 5e). (+)-JQ1 also reduced the expression
of two additional MYC target genes PMM2 (24) and SLC19A1 (25) in BC1 and BCBL1
cells (Figure S3). In contrast, (+)-JQ1 treatment had no significant impact on the expression
of MYB, TERT and TYRO3 in the Namalwa cells (Figure 5e). Thus, sensitivity to (+)-JQ1
correlates closely with the degree of down-regulation of MYC-target genes.
Suppression of BRD4 and c-Myc expression reduces PEL cell viability

Author Manuscript

In the case (+)-JQ1 exerts its effect in PEL cells by inhibiting BRD4 and downregulating cMyc, then silencing of BRD4 and MYC by shRNAs would be expected to resemble the
effect of (+)-JQ1 treatment. To test this hypothesis, we generated stable clones of BC1 cells
expressing tetracycline-inducible H1 promoter (H1/TO)-driven shRNAs targeting BRD4 and
MYC, respectively. Treatment of BC1-H1/TO-BRD4-shRNA and BC1-H1/TO-MYCshRNA cells with doxycycline resulted in downregulation of BRD4 and c-Myc, respectively,
as determined by Western blotting (Figure 6a). More importantly, doxycycline treatment of
BC1-H1/TO-BRD4-shRNA and BC1-H1/TO-MYC-shRNA cells was accompanied by
approximately 40% and 60% reduction in cellular proliferation (Figure 6b and Supplemtary
Table 4), respectively, and G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest (Figure 6c), thus resembling the
phenotype of (+)-JQ1-treated cells. In contrast, doxycycline treatment had no significant
effect on cell proliferation or cell-cycle progression in BC1 cells expressing a scrambled
shRNA as a control (Figure 6b and 6c).
Reconstitution of MYC rescues (+)-JQ1-treated cells from growth-suppression

Author Manuscript

To confirm the functional involvement of c-Myc down-regulation in the anti-proliferative
effect of (+)-JQ1, we studied whether ectopic expression of c-Myc from a retroviral-derived
promoter would rescue them from JQ1-induced growth inhibition. For this purpose, we
generated BC1 cells stably expressing either wild-type c-Myc or its FLAG-tagged T58A
mutant, which is resistant to phosphorylation-induced degradation. Consistent with the
increased stability of the T58A mutant, c-Myc protein expression was modestly increased in
the wild-type c-Myc-transduced cells but strongly increased in the c-Myc-T58A mutant
transduced cells (Figure 7a). We next compared the response of the resulting cells to (+)JQ1. While (+)-JQ1 treatment led to near complete disappearance of c-Myc expression in
the control cells, modest and strong residual c-Myc expression was seen in the wild-type
Myc and T58A-Myc transduced cells, respectively (Figure 7b). Both Myc constructs
conferred significant protection against (+)-JQ1-induced growth inhibition, with the T58AMyc expressing cells showing slightly higher protection (Figure 7c). The addition of ectopic
Myc to BC1 cells also rescued them from (+)-JQ1-induced cell-cycle arrest as determined
by flow cytometry (Figure 7d and Supplementary Table 5). Taken collectively, these results
demonstrate that down-regulation of Myc plays a major role in the growth-inhibitory effect
of BET inhibitors in PEL cells.
Lack of induction of KSHV lytic replication by (+)-JQ1 in PEL
Myc is required for maintenance of KSHV latency and its shRNA-mediated silencing results
in the induction of KSHV Replication and Transcription Activator (RTA), the master
regulator of KSHV lytic replication (16). Therefore, we next examined whether treatment
with (+)-JQ1 results in lytic reactivation of the virus, as measured by expression of RTA

using immunoblotting. As a positive control, we used BCBL1-TREx-RTA cells, which
express RTA from a tetracycline-inducible promoter and undergo a complete cycle of viral
replication upon treatment with doxycycline (26). While treatment of BCBL1-TREx-RTA
cells with doxycycline resulted in robust induction of RTA, treatment of PEL cell lines with
(+)-JQ1 failed to do so (Figure 8a). We have previously generated a reporter cell line,
designated 293-PAN-Luc, which expresses the firefly luciferase gene under the control of
KSHV PAN promoter and responds to infection with KSHV by increasing luciferase activity
in a sensitive and quantitative manner (27). To confirm the lack of lytic replication induction
by (+)-JQ1, cell-free supernatants from (+)-JQ1-treated PEL cells were applied to 293PANLuc cells and assessed for increase in luciferase activity. As shown in Figure 8b, exposure of
293PAN-Luc cells to supernatant from doxycycline-treated BCBL1-TREx-RTA cells led to a
significant increase in luciferase activity while supernatant from (+)-JQ1-treated PEL cells
failed to do so. Thus, (+)-JQ1 induced growth inhibition and apoptosis is not accompanied
by production of infectious virions.
(+)-JQ1 exhibits in vivo growth inhibitory activity against PEL in mouse xenografts
To check the in vivo efficacy of (+)-JQ1 against PEL, we injected the BC1 cells expressing
an RSV-promoter driven firefly luciferase cDNA (BC1-Luc) intra-peritoneally into NOD/
SCID mice. Animals with established tumors, as detected by bioluminescence imaging on
day 3, were randomly assigned to vehicle control (n= 12) and (+)-JQ1 (50 mg/kg twice daily
for 11 days; n = 12). Animals treated with (+)-JQ1 showed reduced tumor growth as
determined by bioluminescence imaging and measurement of body weight, a surrogate for
tumor-induced ascites (Figures 9a-c). In addition, the median survival of (+)-JQ1-treated
animals was significantly improved as compared to the control vehicle-treated animals (27
days vs. 20 days; p=.0088) (Figures 9d).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

As a master regulator of cell proliferation, c-Myc contributes to the disease progression in a
number of human cancers, making it a prime therapeutic target (28). However, conventional
approaches to directly block c-Myc function using small molecule compounds have proven
to be largely ineffective. Using a first in class inhibitor of BET bromodomains, which block
Myc transcription and function indirectly through displacement of chromatin bound coactivator proteins, we provide evidence that PEL cell lines are sensitive to BET inhibitors in
vitro and in vivo. Indeed, the involvement of c-Myc in the inhibitory effects of BET
inhibitors in PEL cell lines is supported by the following lines of evidence. First, we
observed significant down-regulation of c-Myc transcript and protein levels in PEL cell lines
following treatment with BET inhibitors, which was accompanied by depletion of nuclear cMyc. Second, we observed a marked enrichment of down-stream target genes of c-Myc
among the genes perturbed in PEL cell lines following treatment with BET inhibitors. Third,
there was a good correlation between the sensitivity to BET inhibitors and degree of downregulation of MYC and its downstream target genes. Fourth, shRNA-mediated silencing of
MYC and BRD4 in BC1 cells resulted in cell-cycle arrest, thus resembling the cell-cycle
effects observed in cells treated with the BET inhibitors. Consistent with our results in BC1
cells, knock-down of MYC has been also reported to induce cell-cycle arrest in the PEL-

derived BC3 cell line (16). Finally, over-expression of c-Myc via an ectopic retroviral
promoter rescued PEL cells from (+)-JQ1-induced growth inhibition.

BET inhibitors have been previously shown to down-regulate MYC and possess selective
activity against Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and multiple myeloma (8, 14), which carry
chromosomal translocations involving the MYC locus (29-30). The selective downregulation of MYC by (+)-JQ1 has been attributed to the preferential loss of BRD4 at the
super-enhancers and consequent transcription elongation defects that preferentially impacted
genes with super-enhancers, including MYC (15). In contrast, we demonstrate the activity of
BET inhibitors against PEL, in which the MYC locus is structurally intact. More
importantly, we observed that PEL cells are highly sensitive to BET bromodomain
inhibitors. Indeed, the IC50 of both (+)-JQ1 and I-BET151 for PEL cell lines was generally
lower than their IC50 for a panel of hematologic cell lines of diverse origins, including cell
lines derived from multiple myeloma and BL. Although the precise reason for the
remarkable sensitivity of PEL cell lines to BET inhibitors is not known at the present, our
results suggest that the relative level of the c-Myc protein may play a role in this process.
The basal and the post-treatment levels of the c-Myc protein were significantly higher in the
Namalwa and Jurkat cells lines that are relatively resistant to BET inhibitors as compared to
the drug-sensitive PEL cell lines. Even among the PEL cell lines, the basal and posttreatment levels of c-Myc protein correlated well with their resistance to BET inhibitors.
Thus, a possible explanation for the greater sensitivity of PEL cells to BET inhibitors may
lie in their relatively modest expression of the c-Myc protein that is easily suppressed by the
drug treatment. The modest elevation of c-Myc in PEL cells may in turn reflect the fact that
the PEL cells lack structural alterations in the MYC gene (3) and the elevation of c-Myc
activity in these cells is primarily due to post-translational mechanisms involving enhanced
stabilization or activity of the protein (17-19). Thus, while the current paradigm suggests
that the ideal candidates for BET inhibitors are those cancers in which MYC is highly overexpressed due to the activity of super-enhancers (15), our results suggest that such cancers
may not be the most sensitive to treatment with these compound because they will require
much higher doses of the inhibitors to completely down-regulate c-Myc expression from the
extremely high basal levels. Instead, our study suggests that cancers, such as PEL, which
lack structural alterations at the MYC locus and express only modestly high levels of the cMyc protein, are probably equally good or perhaps better candidates for treatment with the
BET inhibitors.

Author Manuscript

While our results suggest a key role of c-Myc down-regulation in the cellular response to
BET inhibitors, perturbation in other cellular and viral genes and signaling pathways is also
likely to contribute to this process. Additionally, while ectopic expression of c-Myc
successfully protected PEL cells from low doses of (+)-JQ1, it failed to confer protection
when exposed to higher doses of the drug. Thus, the effect of BET inhibitors on Mycindependent pathways may also contribute to their growth inhibitory effects against PEL
cells. Indeed, I-BET has been shown to block the expression of a number of inflammatory
genes that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of KSHV-associated malignancies (13).
Additionally, KSHV-encoded LANA tethers viral genomes to host mitotic chromosomes that
ensure maintenance of viral episomes in dividing cells (31-32). The interaction between the
carboxy-terminal domain of LANA and host chromatin is mediated via BRD4 (33-34).

BRD4 was also shown to associate with mitotic chromosomes throughout mitosis and colocalize with LANA and the KSHV episomes on host mitotic chromosomes (33-34). Thus, it
is conceivable that the effect of BET inhibitors on LANA-BRD4 interactions and KSHV
episome maintenance may also contribute to its growth inhibitory effects in PEL cells.
Finally, induction of lytic replication is increasingly believed to play an important role in
KSHV-tumorigenesis (35). Silencing of Myc was recently shown to induce expression of
RTA and lytic protein K8 (16). In contrast, we observed that (+)-JQ1 did not induce
expression of lytic genes or production of infectious virions, thereby allaying these safety
concerns. While the exact mechanism for the lack of lytic reactivation by (+)-JQ1 is not
clear at the present, its effects on Myc-independent genes may be responsible for this
process.

In summary, we have used first in class BET inhibitors to provide strong in vitro and in vivo
pre-clinical rationales for targeting BRD4 and MYC for the treatment of PEL. Epigenetic
modulators affect thousands of genes and many targets of BET inhibitors have already been
described in the literature (9, 11-12, 15, 36). Although our study does not identify any new
target of the BET inhibitors, it addresses a more pressing and clinically relevant issue
regarding the therapeutic development of these compounds: namely, the range of cancers
against which these compounds are likely to show activity. We demonstrate that the utility of
BET inhibitors may not be limited to malignancies in which c-Myc is highly over-expressed
due to genomic alterations that bring the MYC gene under the control of a super-enhancer
and that they may have equal or even greater activity against cancers in which the MYC
genomic locus is structurally intact and c-Myc is only modestly over-expressed. Thus, our
results considerably extend the range of cancers that are candidates for clinical testing of
BET inhibitors.

from Dr. Ellen Vitetta (UT Southwestern Medical Center) and Karpass-299 and HPB-ALL
were from Dr. Alan Epstein (USC). UM-PEL-1 and UM-PEL-3 were provided by Drs.
Izidore Lossos and Juan Ramos, respectively (both from U Miami). 293-PAN-Luc and
BCBL1-TREx-RTA cells have been described previously (27). BC1-Luc cells were
generated by infection with a retroviral vector encoding a Rous Sarcoma Virus promoter
driven firefly luciferase construct. (+)-JQ1 and its inactive enantiomer (-)-JQ1 were
generously provided by Dr. James Bradner (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). I-BET151 was
from ChemieTek and Doxycycline was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
Retroviral and lentiviral constructs
Retroviral constructs containing cMyc-T58A and Flag epitope-tagged wild-type c-Myc were
obtained from Addgene. Recombinant retroviruses were generated and used to infect PEL
cell lines as described previously (37). For generation of shRNA encoding lentiviral vectors,

shRNA oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table 2) directed against human c-Myc and BRD4
mRNAs were annealed and cloned into a modified pENT entry vector containing a
tetracycline-inducible H1 promoter (H1/TO). The cassette containing the H1/TO promoter
along with the shRNA hairpin was concatenated as described earlier (37) so as to result in
eight copies of the H1/TO-shRNA cassettes in each vector. Recombination based subcloning was used to transfer the concatenated H1/TO-shRNA cassettes into pSLIK
destination vector (38). 293FT cells were used to induce virus production as described
previously (37). Packaged virus was then used to infect PEL cells and positive clones were
selected with G418. Doxycycline (500 ng/mL) was used to induce the expression of
shRNAs.
Animal studies

Author Manuscript

5 week old female NOD/SCID mice ( NCI) were injected intra-peritoneally (IP) with 2 ×
107 BC1-Luc cells. To assess establishment of tumors, mice were imaged 3 days post
inoculation using an IVIS Spectrum Imaging system (PerkinElmers, Waltham, MA). Mice
were randomly segregated into two treatment groups [vehicle control and (+)-JQ1, n = 12
per group] and were treated IP twice daily with (+)-JQ1 (50 mg/kg) or vehicle control (10%
β-cyclodextrin, Sigma). Bioluminescence imaging and body weight (a surrogate for tumor
induced ascites) were used to assess tumor burden. All animal procedures were performed
under IACUC approved protocols.
Statistical analyses
Two-tailed paired Student's t test was used to test for differences between two groups.
Differences with a p≤0.05 were considered as statistically significant. All experiments were
repeated a minimum of two times with duplicate/triplicate samples.
