ABSTRACT
The bone marrow microenvironment plays a decisive role in multiple myeloma
progression and drug resistance. Chemokines are soluble mediators of cell migration,
proliferation and survival and essentially modulate tumor progression and drug
resistance. Here we investigated bone marrow-derived chemokines of naive and
therapy-refractory myeloma patients and discovered that high levels of the chemokine
CCL27, known so far for its role in skin inflammatory processes, correlated with worse
overall survival of the patients. In addition, chemokine levels were significantly higher
in samples from patients who became refractory to bortezomib at first line treatment
compared to resistance at later treatment lines.
In vitro as well as in an in vivo model we could show that CCL27 triggers bortezomibresistance of myeloma cells. This effect was strictly dependent on the expression of
the respective receptor, CCR10, on stroma cells and involved the modulation of IL-10
expression, activation of myeloma survival pathways, and modulation of proteasomal
activity. Drug resistance could be totally reversed by blocking CCR10 by siRNA as well
as blocking IL-10 and its receptor.
From our data we suggest that blocking the CCR10/CCL27/IL-10 myeloma-stroma
crosstalk is a novel therapeutic target that could be especially relevant in early refractory
myeloma patients.

INTRODUCTION

therapeutic agents such as proteasome inhibitors and
immunomodulatory drugs, which not only target the
malignant clone but also the supportive microenvironment
led to improved progression-free and overall survival. Yet,
myeloma patients still acquire resistance to all available
therapies and finally succumb to their lethal disease.
Chemokines are a family of low molecular weight
(8–10 kDa) secreted, homeostatic or proinflammatory
cytokines that regulate cell trafficking via interacting

Multiple myeloma is an incurable plasma cell
malignancy characterized by the clonal proliferation
of plasma cells in the bone marrow compartment. This
specific microenvironment constitutes a sanctuary
for the cancer cells supporting growth, survival and
drug-resistance via cell-to-cell contact and soluble
mediators (reviewed in [1]). The application of novel

with a subset of seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled
receptors [2]. These chemotactic cytokines are also major
players in the crosstalk between tumor cells and stroma
cells and are essentially involved in metastasis, survival,
development of drug resistance and escape from immune
surveillance in numerous cancer entities [3–6]. Chemokines
in multiple myeloma are known to contribute to the bone
marrow homing of the malignant cells and ligand binding
can also modulate integrin expression contributing to the
development of cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance
[7–9]. In addition, osteolysis, a main characteristic of
advanced myeloma disease, is essentially mediated by
chemokines [10]. However, a complete chemokine profile
of the diseased bone marrow is still lacking and might give
clues for the development of novel therapies.
CCL27, also called cutaneous T-cell attracting
chemokine (C-TACK), is mostly known to cause T-cell
mediated skin inflammation [11, 12] and high serum levels
are of prognostic relevance in patients suffering from
psoriasis and atopic dermatitis [13, 14]. The respective
receptor, CCR10, is expressed on T-cells and on various
subtypes of normal plasma cells. The mature B cells respond
exclusively to the second ligand of the receptor, CCL28.
Signaling leads to a selective accumulation of normal
IgA+ plasmablasts in mucosal tissue [15–17] and of IgE+
plasmablasts in inflamed airways [18]. In addition, CCR10
ligation by CCL28 supports the maintenance of memory
B-cells and contributes to survival and proliferation of
long-lived IgA-producing plasma cells [19, 20]. Recently,
work of Karlsson and colleagues revealed that the CCL28/
CCR10 axis is an important growth and survival pathway
for hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells in the
bone marrow niche [21]. Of note, mesenchymal stem cells
and bone marrow derived keratinocytes as well utilize
CCR10/CCL27 signaling [22, 23].
In this study, we investigated bone marrow-derived
chemokines of myeloma patients with a special focus on
early and late refractory patients. We discovered that high
CCL27 levels correlated with shorter overall survival
of the patients and with early resistance to bortezomib
treatment. We further investigated the involved
mechanisms in vitro and in vivo.

and healthy donor samples (n = 16; median 1620 pg/ml;
IQR 947-1996; p < 0.0001, Figure 1A). Patients‘ data is
summarized in Table 1. Utilizing cutoffs determined by
receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, we
found that high levels of CCL27 were associated with
worse overall survival of patients (Figure 1B; cutoff
value = 4884 pg/ml; median survival 29 vs. 77 months,
p = 0.0016). We performed multivariate analysis including
CCL27 expression (high or low), sex, and stage (stage
MM3B versus all other stages) as covariates. From
the 45  cases, one was excluded due to missing values.
Although sample numbers were low, Cox regression
analysis revealed that CCL27 was an independent
prognostic factor for overall survival with a hazard ratio of
4.3 [1.727 – 10.975; 95% CI, p = 0.002]. Of note, CCL27
levels did not correlate with tumor load (data not shown).
We further analyzed untreated bone marrow plasma
from patients who showed bortezomib-refractory disease
at first line treatment (n = 12) compared to patients that
became refractory to bortezomib at higher treatment lines
(n = 18) Clinical characteristics of patients is summarized
in Table 2. In a subset of first line refractory patients,
CCL27 levels were significantly enhanced (Figure 1C;
1st line median 4935 pg/ml; IQR 3376-8669; other lines
median 3385 pg/ml; IQR 2754-4688; p < 0.05).
CCL27 binds uniquely to its respective receptor,
CCR10, which has also a second ligand, CCL28. To
gain more knowledge about possible interactions of
this receptor/ligand(s) system, we measured CCL28
plasma levels as well as receptor expression on plasma
cells and stroma cells. Compared to CCL27, CCL28
levels were substantially lower and even not detectable
in 20/42 patients’ bone marrow samples (Supplementary
Figure 1A; MM median 25 pg/ml; IQR 0-245; Healthy
median 349 pg/ml; IQR 282-466). We confirmed
previously reported CCR10 expression on myeloma cell
lines and primary plasma cells [24] in our samples and
we found substantial CCR10 expression on stroma cell
line HS-5 and primary fibroblasts, which we routinely use
as coculture systems. Primary stroma cells isolated from
the bone marrow of healthy and diseased individuals also
expressed CCR10. Representative flow cytometer analyses
are depicted in Figure 1D. We also detected CCL27 in the
supernatants from myeloma cell lines as well as stroma
cells (Supplementary Figure 1B).
Functionally, Nakayama et al. showed that CCL27
and CCL28 can induce chemotaxis of myeloma cell
lines [24]. We found enhanced adhesion (Supplementary
Figure 2A) and chemotaxis (Supplementary Figure 2B) in
response to CCL27 for myeloma cell lines NCI-H929 and
MM.1S but not for OPM-2. None of the cell lines migrated
in response to the CCL28 concentrations tested and both
chemokines had no impact on myeloma cell proliferation
(Supplementary Figure 2C). In all cell lines, the extent
of bortezomib-induced cell death was not altered by the
addition of CCL27 or CCL28 (Supplementary Figure 2D).

RESULTS
High levels of CCL27 in the bone marrow
correlate with poor overall survival and early
refractory disease of myeloma patients
We screened for chemokines in bone marrow
aspirates of patients and age-matched healthy donors using
semi-quantitative protein arrays. Beside already known
myeloma-associated chemotactic molecules, CCL27
was overexpressed in patients’ samples. Concomitant
Elisa analysis confirmed significant differences between
myeloma (n = 45; median 4640 pg/ml; IQR 3320-7291)

Since CCL27 is primarily known for its T cell attracting
properties, we additionally investigated a possible
correlation between infiltrating T cells and CCL27 levels
in myeloma patients on the basis of CD62L/CD45RA
expression. However, T cell subset infiltration rates did
not correlate with CCL27 levels (data not shown).

myeloma cells almost completely from bortezomibinduced cell death. Supplement of the second ligand,
CCL28, had no effect (Figure 2A). Results were
confirmed using primary fibroblasts (Supplementary
Figure 3A). While CCL27 also blocked the induction
of cell death by other proteasome inhibitors, i.e. MG132 (Supplementary Figure 3B) and carfilzomib
(Supplementary Figure  3C), efficacy of melphalan
treatment was not affected (Supplementary Figure 3D).
Primary stroma cells isolated from three myeloma
patients also rescued myeloma cell lines (Figure 2B),
and survival of CD138-sorted primary myeloma cells
from four patients seeded on HS-5 layer and treated with
bortezomib was ameliorated by the addition of CCL27
(Figure 2C).

In the presence of stroma cells, CCL27 rescues
myeloma cells from apoptosis induced by
proteasome inhibitors
We further utilized stroma-myeloma cell cocultures
in order to approach the in vivo crosstalk more closely
and treated the cells with different drugs. In the presence
of HS-5 stroma cells, the addition of CCL27 rescued

CCL27 protects myeloma cells from bortezomib
treatment in a xenotransplant model

activity in myeloma cell lines (data not shown). On the
other hand, bortezomib treatment led to enhanced CCL27
expression in myeloma cell lines, but not in HS-5 stroma
cells (Figure 4D).
Knock-down of CCR10 on HS-5 cells by siRNA
resensitized cocultured myeloma cells to bortezomib
(Figure 5A). Of note, downregulation of CCR10 per se
significantly blocked IL-10 production in cocultures and
CCL27 addition did not enhance levels (Figure 5B). Drug
resistance was also reversed by the addition of neutralizing
antibodies to IL-10 and IL-10 receptor (Figure 5C).

Chemokines are important players throughout all
species, however, caution is requested for the interpolation
of experimental results between genera, especially
between mouse and human (reviewed in [25]). Instead
of a mouse model, we here chose a chick chorioallantoic
membrane (CAM) assay modified for the use with human
myeloma cells as previously reported [26, 27]. This model
has also been successfully utilized to investigate tumorstroma interactions in other human B-cell malignancies
[28, 29].
Onplants containing eGFP-transfected OPM-2
myeloma cells and primary human fibroblasts in a
collagen matrix were positioned onto the CAM and
treated with bortezomib with/without the presence of
chemokine for five days (Figure 3A, schematic view).
Tumors were excised and tumor mass was quantified using
an anti-GFP-Elisa. As shown, addition of CCL27 rescued
myeloma cells efficiently from treatment in this setting
(Figure 3A, pictures and graph). This experiment was
confirmed using NCI-H929, MM.1S and untransfected
OPM-2 cells (Figure 3B, pictures and graphs). In this
setting, the number of proliferating myeloma cells was
assessed by immunohistochemical staining with human
Ki-67. Whereas CCL27 rescued myeloma cells from
drug-treatment, addition of CCL28 had no impact on cell
survival in both assays.

IL-10 activates survival pathways, counteracts
blockade of proteasomal activity and decreases
surface immunoglobulin expression of myeloma
cells
In further experiments, we found that recombinant
IL-10 rescued the malignant plasma cells from bortezomibinduced cell death also when cultured alone, circumventing
the need for CCL27 and stromal support (Figure 6A).
IL-10 is known to signal mainly via phosphorylation
of STAT-3, which we also confirmed. IL-10 induced p-p38
in MM.1S cells but not in NCI cells and had no significant
impact on p-AKT and p-ERK expression in both cell
lines. Bortezomib treatment did not alter phosphorylation
patterns significantly at the chosen time point (Figure 6B
and Supplementary Table 1). The specific rescue from
bortezomib-induced cell death by CCL27 led us to further
investigate the proteasomal activity of myeloma cells under
treatment. Briefly, treatment-related decrease of activity was
significantly restored by the addition of CCL27 and this
effect was abolished by an IL-10 blocking antibody (Figure
6C). Concomitantly, surface expression of monoclonal
immunoglobulin was decreased on IL-10 treated myeloma
cells (NCI-H929, IgA myeloma; OPM-2, IgG myeloma)
(Figure 6D), whereas we found higher levels of free
immunoglobulin in the supernatants of these cells upon
CCL27 +/− bortezomib treatment. This effect was blocked
by the addition of an anti-IL-10 antibody (Figure 6E).
In summary, we found that CCL27, a novel
chemokine in the context of the bone marrow
microenvironment, confers myeloma drug resistance to
proteasome inhibitors by binding to stromal CCR10 and
inducing IL-10, a myeloma survival factor. Enhanced IL-10
levels foster phosphorylation of the survival molecule
STAT-3 as well as modulation of proteasomal activity and
shedding of immunoglobulins, contributing to myeloma
survival under treatment.

CCR10 ligation regulates stromal IL-10
levels and blocking the receptor restores drug
sensitivity
We found that myeloma cells were rescued even
when separated from the stroma cell layer by 0.4 µm
transwells, although to a lower extent (data not shown).
Therefore, we further focussed on soluble factor(s) that
could be involved in this drug resistance. From almost
100 proteins tested (including cytokines, chemokines and
growth factors), about 20 were expressed at significant
levels. Out of them, one factor was significantly regulated
in myeloma-stroma cell coculture treated with bortezomib
+/− CCL27, i.e. IL-10 (Figure 4A).
IL-10 is discussed as a survival factor for myeloma
cells [30] and is induced in myeloma-stroma coculture [31],
which we also confirmed. Bortezomib treatment has been
shown to inhibit IL-10 expression probably via blocking
NF-κB signaling [32]. In our experiments utilizing HS-5
as well as primary fibroblasts (PFF), CCL27 prevented
the bortezomib-induced downregulation of IL-10.
The second ligand, CCL28, had no impact on IL-10
levels (Figure 4B). We also found that CCL27 induced
NF-κB activity in stroma cells, and levels remained high
when cells were treated with bortezomib and CCL27
(Figure 4C). However, CCL27 did not induce NF-κB

DISCUSSION
Resistance to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib,
which is currently utilized in most therapeutic schemes,
is an Achilles heel of myeloma therapy. About one third
of myeloma patients are primary refractory to bortezomib

treatment while most other patients develop resistance
over time [33, 34] with no predictive markers known so
far. Here, we discovered that a single chemokine, CCL27,
which is upregulated in myeloma patients, induced
bortezomib resistance in myeloma cells. The effect was
intimately linked to stromal expression of CCR10 and the
production of IL-10. Notably, blocking stromal CCR10

expression or IL-10 signalling resensitized the malignant
cells to treatment.
From our data, CCL27 emerges as novel chemokine
in the context of the bone marrow microenvironment.
Its presence in healthy control samples suggests a
homeostatic role in this compartment, which has yet to be
defined. In this regard, stroma cells might be one source

chorioallantoic membrane assay was used for in vivo testing and the setup of the 3D-onplant is summarized in the drawing. Tumor onplants
containing myeloma cells and primary fibroblasts in a ratio of 11:1, bortezomib (1 nM) and/or chemokine (CCL27: 7.9 nM, CCL28: 8.1 nM)
in a collagen matrix were positioned on the membrane and incubated for 5 days. Single myeloma xenografts were photographed using a
stereo-fluorescence microscope (Olympus SZX10 at 12× magnification), excised, and GFP concentrations of single tumors were measured
by Elisa. Values are shown as mean concentration in pg/ml ± SEM (n = 12). (B) Immunohistochemical analysis of cross-sections of

bortezomib-induced cell death in vitro. However, levels
of the defined “high expressors” (same or higher as
5000 pg/ml) led to drug-resistance in our models.
Therefore, in the patient setting, the selection of high
producer myeloma cell clones and/or the observed
upregulation of CCL27 in myeloma cells upon
bortezomib-treatment could tip the balance in favour of the
tumor. Importantly, many other cell types are involved in
the microenvironmental crosstalk in myeloma (reviewed
in [37]) with some of them (e.g. specific subtypes of T
cells and dendritic cells) also being responsive to CCL27.
Other cell types might also modulate levels of soluble
CCL27 and these putative interactions could essentially

of this chemokine. Enhanced levels in patients correlated
with lower overall survival and levels were specifically
high in about 40% of primary refractory patients. We
hypothesize that the significant rise in CCL27 expression
found in these patients facilitates oligomerization at the
receptor level leading to specific, pro-tumor signaling.
Oligomerization is often required in vivo for functional
output of chemokine signaling [35], which might include
cytokine induction. CCL27 has been described to
oligomerize over a narrow concentration range, which
is known to be relatively high [36]. In line with this, we
found that CCL27 levels in the range of healthy donors
(up to 3000 pg/ml) could not protect myeloma cells from

bortezomib alone is shown. (B) In the same setting, IL-10 levels in cocultures of myeloma cells and HS-5 or PFF cell layers (ratio 2:1) with

contribute to the observed effect in vivo. Further in depthinvestigations are certainly needed.
In any case, stromal CCR10 expression is a
prerequisite for the observed rescue. Therefore, targeting
this receptor could be a novel and efficient therapy for
resistant and primary refractory patients. First data on the
CCR10 antagonist POL7085, a protein epitope mimetic,
which was recently successfully used in a model of
allergic eosinophilic airway inflammation [38] might

pave the way for an application in multiple myeloma.
Side effects should be manageable since CCR10 knock
out mice displayed mild defects of plasma cell [19] and
skin-specific T cell migration [39] and showed no obvious
phenotype.
Concerning the involved pathways, CCL27 is
known to be activated by the NF-κB pathway [40], and
should thus be down-regulated by bortezomib treatment.
In our experiments, we observed upregulation of CCL27

and a CCL27-induced stabilization of IL-10 in response
to bortezomib, which is totally unexpected and in contrast
to current data [32, 41]. Moreover, we could show that
CCL27 itself induces NF-κB signaling in stroma cells and
this signaling might contribute essentially to high IL-10
levels. Since NF-κB constitutes also a major survival
pathway of myeloma cells and their microenvironment in
general, this counterregulation by CCL27 warrants further
detailed investigations.
In our experiments, IL-10 plays an essential role
in the transduction of survival. This cytokine has been
shown to induce myeloma cell survival and growth and
to confer sensitivity to various other gp130-activating
cytokines, including IL-6 [30, 42]. Targeting IL-10 could
be of additional interest in the context of tumor immune

evasion, since it is known as an immunosuppressive
cytokine [43]. However, in vivo, IL-10 levels are not
detectable in the majority of patients with established
myeloma disease and expression appears to be mostly
restricted to patients suffering from plasma cell leukemia
[42, 44]. Recent data utilizing an ultrasensitive Elisa
approach, however, support an in vivo impact of IL-10
also in myeloma, although concentrations measured
were in the low picogram range [45]. It is likely that
microenvironmental IL-10 is immediately utilized by
the myeloma cells and therefore efficient targeting might
be hard to accomplish. In contrast, targeting chemokine/
receptor crosstalk is feasible and therapeutically relevant,
as has been shown e.g. for CXCL12/CXCR4 also in
myeloma [46, 47].

Clinical characteristics of patients who became refractory to bortezomib in the course of treatment. Data refer to date of
diagnosis.
In summary, we suggest that targeting the CCR10/
CCL27 crosstalk in the myeloma microenvironment could
contribute to the development of tailored therapeutic
interventions bringing multiple myeloma to a chronic,
manageable disease or even to cure.

heparinized bone marrow (5 ml, 10 U sodium-heparin/ ml
of sample) was centrifuged within 1 hour at the Tyrolean
Cancer Research Insitute in Innsbruck and at Brno
Hospital, respectively, at 400 g for 10 minutes and
plasma was immediately stored at −80°C until further
analyses. The study was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki and ethical approval was
given by the local Ethics Committee (approval numbers
UN4402, UN3263, UN5064 (Innsbruck) and 16/2011
(Brno). Patients as well as healthy donors provided written
informed consent. Primary myeloma cells were purified
using CD138 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany)
following manufacturer’s protocol and primary stroma
cells were collected from bone marrow aspirates due to
their adherence on plastic and flow cytometric analysis of
their phenotype (CD90+/CD45−).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient samples
Plasma from bone marrow aspirates of the
proximal femur during hip arthroplasty were collected
through routine analysis of healthy donors (n = 16) at the
Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University Hospital
Innsbruck. These healthy subjects were screened for the
presence of viral and bacterial infections or any bone
abnormalities and did not receive immunomodulatory
drugs or suffer from diseases known to influence the
immune system, including autoimmune diseases or cancer.
Bone marrow aspirates from the posterior iliac crest of
myeloma patients (n = 45) were taken at the Department
of Internal Medicine, Innsbruck Medical University.
In addition, untreated samples from patients that were
found to be refractory to bortezomib at first line treatment
(n = 12) and at later lines (2–11; n = 18), respectively,
were collected at the Department of Internal Medicine,
University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic, and analyzed
retrospectively. For the standardized sample preparation,

Cell lines, cell culture, and reagents
Human myeloma cell lines NCI-H929 and OPM-2
were purchased from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany),
the human stroma cell line HS-5 from American Type
Culture Collection (Rockville, USA), and primary
foreskin fibroblasts from Promocell company (Germany).
MM.1S were a generous gift from Dr. N. L. Krett [48]
(Northwestern University, Chicago, USA). Cell lines
were routinely grown in RPMI-1640 (Lonza, Switzerland)
with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma, USA), 100 µg/ml
78614

Oncotarget

L-glutamine and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Life
Technologies, UK) at 37°C with 5% CO2. For MM.1S,
fungizone (Fisher Scientific, Austria) was added as
described [48]. Cells were obtained from DSMZ and
ATCC in 2012 and expanded within 6 weeks. Frozen
aliquotes were further utilized for no more than 3 months.
Additionally, cell lines were routinely fingerprinted at the
end of the experiments to re-confirm their origin (STRmethod, Institute of Legal Medicine, Medical University
of Innsbruck) and tested for mycoplasma negativity.
Other purchased reagents include Bortezomib,
Carfilzomib (Sellekchem, USA), MG132 (Sigma, USA),
recombinant human CCL27, CCL28 (R&D Systems,
USA), IL-10 (eBioscience, USA) and the anti-human
antibodies for IL-10 (clone #JES3-9D7, eBioscience,
USA), IL-10 receptor (clone #3F9, Biolegend, USA),
CD90 (Acris, USA), CD45, CD38, IgA, and IgG (Miltenyi
Biotec, Germany), as well as CCR10 (clone #314305;
R&D Systems, USA).

cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACS
Canto II flow cytometer with subsequent data analysis
using FACS Diva software 7.0 (BD Biosciences, USA).

Protein arrays

Transwell migration assay

Customized chemokine arrays (Ray Biotech, USA)
were used to semiquantitatively analyze myeloma cell
line supernatants and bone marrow plasma samples.
Customized arrays containing antibodies against
107  chemokines, cytokines and growth factors were
utilized for the analysis of coculture supernatants
following exactly the manufacturer’s protocol. Arrays
were scanned with GenePixx 4000B microarray scanner
(Molecular Devices, USA) and signal intensities at 532 nm
were evaluated.

Myeloma cell migration was performed using an
8 µm pore sized transwell system (Corning costar, USA)
coated with fibronectin (100 ng/ml). Myeloma cells at a
concentration of 1 × 105 were placed on the upper chamber
and the lower chamber was filled with media with or
without chemokines (7.9 nM and 8.1 nM). After 8 hrs, the
medium in the lower chamber along with the cells were
collected and counted by FACS for 1 min. Migration rate
was calculated as % increase over control.

Cell adhesion assay
The adhesion of myeloma cells was performed
using cellix flow system under shear stress. Vena8
biochips (Cellix Ltd, Dublin, Ireland) were coated with
fibronectin+/−CCL27 and +/−CCL28, respectively,
blocked with 0.2% BSA for 30 mins at room temperature
and washed once with Hank’s BSS medium. The cells
were loaded into the coated channels at shear stress of 0.5
dynes/cm2 using Mirus nanopump (Cellix) and allowed to
sit on the layer for 10 mins. Then the flow was started
and continued with different shear stress of 0.5 dynes/cm2,
0.1 dynes/cm2 and 0.2 dynes/cm2 for every 30 secs. At
different time points, images were recorded and analyzed
by DucoCell software (Cellix).

Proliferation assay

Elisa

Proliferation was measured by 3H-thymidine
incorporation assays. Myeloma cells (1 × 104 cells/well)
were seeded into a 96-well plate with/without the addition
of chemokines as described and 1 µCi of 3H-thymidine
was added to each well for the last 16 hrs of a 72 hrs
incubation period. Cells were harvested onto glass fibre
filters, scintillation liquid was added and radioactivity was
measured using a Scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter,
model LS-6500). Experiments were repeated at least
3 times in quadruplicates and statistical analyses were
performed utilizing paired Student’s T-test.

Sandwich Elisa to measure CCL27, CCL28, IL-10,
(R&D systems, Germany), immunoglobulins A and G
(Cell Biolab, Inc., USA) and green fluorescent protein
(GFP; eBioscience, USA), respectively, were performed
following the manufacturers’ protocols. The optical
density was measured using benchmark microplate reader
(Bio-rad laboratories, USA).
The amount of DNA-bound and thus activated
NF- kB in nuclear extracts (prepared utilizing Nuclear
Cell Extraction Kit, Active Motif) of HS-5 stroma cell
line and myeloma cell lines NCI-H929, OPM-2, and
MM.1S was quantified by Elisa using the TransAM NFkB p65 Transcription Factor Assay kit (Active Motif North
America, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturers’
protocol and as described before [26].

Apoptosis assay
Myeloma cells (1 × 105/well) were seeded in
triplicates in 96-wells and incubated as indicated. In
coculture experiments, myeloma cells were seeded onto
50.000 HS-5 stroma cells, i.e. in a ratio of 2:1. Survival of
myeloma cells was evaluated by flow cytometry utilizing
Annexin-V-APC and 7-AAD staining (BD Biosciences,
USA) of gated myeloma cells (CD38high/CD45 low-neg).

Flow cytometry
Surface expression of CCR10, IgA and IgG
(Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) was measured by flow

was used to define cut off for high and low expression
of CCL27, respectively. All analyses were performed
utilizing GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software,
Inc, USA). Kaplan-Meier curves were applied for survival
analysis. SPSS statistics was used for multivariate analysis.

The CAM assay used in this study was essentially
performed as described previously [26]. We performed
two settings: first, collagen onplants containing eGFPtransfected myeloma cells and primary fibroblasts
were cultured with/without the addition of CCL27,
bortezomib and combinations thereof, respectively. From
these xenografts, protein was prepared and tumor load
was determined by anti-GFP-Elisa. Second, we seeded
onplants as above utilizing myeloma cells without eGFPtransfection. For histological analysis, onplants were
excised, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution and
further processed for paraffin sectioning and staining.
Tumor growth was analyzed by staining proliferating
cells with anti-human Ki-67 antibody. Tumor area was
determined using the ImageJ program (NIH, USA).
