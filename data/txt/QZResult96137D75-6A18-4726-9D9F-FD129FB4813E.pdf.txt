ABSTRACT
Conventional non-surgical therapeutic regimens against osteosarcoma are
subject to chemoresistance and tumor relapse, and immunotherapy may be promising
for this tumor. However, it’s hard to find satisfactory epitopes for immunotherapy
against osteosarcoma. Cancer/testis antigens (CTAs), such as MAGE-A family and
NY-ESO-1, the potential antigens that almost exclusively express in tumor cells
and immune-privileged sites, have been found expressed in osteosarcoma also.
Nevertheless, the expression of CTAs is downregulated in many tumors, constraining
the application of immunotherapy. In this article, we demonstrate that the expression
of MAGE-A family and NY-ESO-1 in osteosarcoma cells can be upregulated following
treatment with demethylating agent 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine and consequently induces
a CTA specific CD8+ T-cell response against osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo. The
in vivo imaging was realized by using luciferase-transfected HOS cells and DiR
labeled T-cells in severely combined immunodeficiency mouse models. Cytotoxic T
cells specifically recognizing MAGE-A family and NY-ESO-1 clustered at the tumor
site in mice pre-treated with DAC and resulted in tumor growth suppression, while
it was not observed in mice without DAC pre-treatment. This study is important for
more targeted therapeutic approaches and suggests that adoptive immunotherapy,
combined with demethylating treatment, has the potential for non-surgical therapeutic
strategy against osteosarcoma.

osteosracoma since 1980s. Therefore, alternate therapeutic
strategies are needed not only for patients with refractory
tumors but also as an adjuvant to localized diseases.
Immunotherapy has been considered to be a
promising method against osteosarcoma [4]. The
immune system plays an important role in controlling
osteosarcoma. Transfer of naive T cells to murine
osteosarcoma models resulted in immune reconstitution
and significantly decreased metastatic recurrence [5].
Therefore, immunotherapy based on upregulation of
immune response will be an encouraging therapeutic

INTRODUCTION
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant
tumor of bone in childhood and adolescence, which is
also associated with local invasion and early metastatic
potential [1]. Despite intensification of conventional
chemotherapy and surgery, the 5-year survival rate for
patients with localized tumor have reached a plateau at
about 65% [2], and it is 20% for patients with relapsed
tumors or metastasis [3]. There has been very little
improvement in the outcomes of patients with localized

strategy against osteosarcoma [6]. In consideration of the
significant toxic side effects caused by the use of cytokines
in active immunotherapy, adoptive immunotherapy
targeting tumor specific antigens by CD8+ T lymphocytes
may be promising. Finding a tumor specific antigen that
can be reasonably targeted by CD8+ T cells is a key
component in the application of adoptive immunotherapy
for osteosarcoma. Cancer/testis antigens (CTAs), such as
MAGE-A family proteins and NY-ESO-1, are considered
to exist only in tumor cells including osteosarcoma [7],
glioblastoma [8], breast cancer [9], and immune-privileged
sites [10]. There are also meta-analysis studies for CTAs
as biomarkers in tumors [11, 12]. The specificity of CTAs
makes them brilliant epitopes for antigen specific CD8+ T
lymphocytes. Nevertheless, the level of CTA expression
may vary widely in tumors, and some CTA genes are
silenced in osteosarcoma, complicating the CTA-based
immunotherapy. If CTA expression may be elevated
in osteosarcoma, the increased tumor immunogenicity
will create excellent conditions for CTA specific
immunotherapy.
Epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in
regulating CTA expression, especially DNA methylation
[13]. Methylation on promoter will result in the
downregulated expression of genes; demethylating agents,
such as decitabine (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, DAC), are
potent inhibitors of DNA methylation. A substantial number
of studies proved that demethylating treatment would lead
to reexpression or enhanced expression of CTAs in multiple
tumors, including leukemia [14, 15], pancreatic cancer [16],
and neuroblastoma [17], etc. More data on osteosarcoma are
still urgently needed.
In this study, we have demonstrated that expression
of MAGE-A family and NY-ESO-1 in osteosarcoma
cell line U2OS and HOS can be elevated following
demethylating treatment with DAC. Among them,
NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A10 and MAGE-A4 are the most
upregulated in U2OS; NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A4 are the
most upregulated in HOS. Furthermore, we generated
CTA specific T-cells in vitro and proved that the elevated
CTA expression would facilitate CTA specific CD8+
T-cell-mediated tumor cell killing in vitro and in vivo.

in elevating CTA expression in U2OS cells, albeit some
of the CTAs tested in this study are already expressed in
this cell line. Among them, the expression of MAGE-A10
and NY-ESO-1 showed the strongest enhancement in both
protein and mRNA level. MAGE-A10 and NY-ESO-1
proteins were undetectable in untreated U2OS cells, and
the expression of mRNA was also at a low-level. As
treatment time increased, however, the expression of each
of these CTAs was significantly enhanced. In untreated
cells, MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A4 showed the strongest
expression at mRNA level. As expected, the result of
western blot assay showed that MAGE-A proteins were
already expressed in U2OS cells, although it was difficult
to identify exactly which ones were detected. According
to a previous study, the immunoblot analysis revealed
that MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A4 proteins were expressed
in U2OS cells [7], which were consistent with our
results of qRT-PCR for these two roles. Nevertheless,
demethylating treatment strengthened the expression of
these two antigens, especially MAGE-A4. The expression
of MAGE-A2, A3, A6 and A12 were also enhanced in
different degrees, which may elevate the immunogenicity
of U2OS cells to T-cells.
Although expression of CTAs is already found in
U2OS cells, none of the CTAs we examined in this study
are expressed in untreated HOS cells. Encouragingly,
successful enhancement of CTA expression was induced
after demethylating treatment. Data presented in Figure 1d
and 1e demonstrated that expression of MAGE-A4
and NY-ESO-1 was significantly elevated. There was
expression of MAGE-A4 after 3 days of exposure to
DAC, and NY-ESO-1 was expressed after 7 days of
treatment (figure 1h). The expression of MAGE-A6
seemed to represent a dramatic magnification compared
to the control group; however, it was still weaker than
that of MAGE-A4 or NY-ESO-1. This may be due to the
extremely low expression level of MAGE-A6 in untreated
cells. We repeated the assays several times and checked
the expression of MAGE-A6 in original HOS cells, and
finally confirmed it. The rest of CTAs also showed an
elevated expression in different degrees.

CTA specific CD8+ T-cells were generated,
and recognized DAC-treated osteosarcoma cells
in vitro

RESULTS
Demethylating treatment showed timedependent effects on elevating CTA expression in
U2OS and HOS over a 7-day interval

In consideration of the existing expression of
MAGE-A antigens in U2OS cells, DCs utilized in the
assays against U2OS cells were pulsed with NY-ESO-1
peptide only. In order to culture CD8+ T-cells, which would
recognize each MAGE-A antigen individually for the use
in cytotoxic assays against HOS cells, we synthesized
peptide p248V9 (YLEYRQVPV) [18]. Using previously
generated DCs pulsed with multi-MAGE-A and NY-ESO-1

We treated the cells with 1 μM DAC for 1 day,
3 days, 5 days and 7days respectively, and then cells were
harvested to perform western blot and quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR). Data presented in Figure 1a, 1b, 1c and
1g demonstrated that DAC showed time-dependent effects

irrelevant peptides. In MTS assays, the CTA specific CD8+
T-cells showed cytotoxicity against U2OS and HOS cells
pre-treated with DAC (figure 3), while there was hardly
any effect on untreated tumor cells. DAC treatment showed
time-dependent cytotoxic effects, consistent with the results
of a previous study on the single agent effects of DAC on
osteosarcoma [19].

Several groups performed immunotherapy against
osteosarcoma using NK cells and reported that
osteosarcoma cells were potentially susceptible to NK
cell cytotoxicity [20, 21]; studies focusing on using NK
cells against osteosarcoma are going on [22]. Specific
immunotherapy targeting HER2 with modified T cells
against osteosarcoma was also conjectured to be feasible,
and a substantial number of attempts were performed to
resolve the issue of osteosarcoma cells expressing HER2
at a too low level [23, 24]. In addition, in our previous
study, we demonstrated that osteosarcoma cells were
highly susceptible to γδ T cell-mediated killing following
treatment with zoledronate [25], which is a widely used
amino bisphosphonate in inhibiting osteoclastic bone
resorption in advanced cancers [26] and shows antitumor effects on osteosarcoma by inducing apoptosis
and inhibiting proliferation [27, 28]. Nevertheless, it
was still restricted to immune escape as the shortcoming
in recognition. Pharmacologic upregulation of specific
antigens may be a promising method to maximize the
response to specific immunotherapy.
Cancer/testis antigens are characterized by specificity
in tumors, several clinical trials using NY-ESO-1 or
MAGE-A3 specific lymphocytes against soft-tissue tumors
and lung cancer have achieved success [29–31]. However,
some CTAs are epigenetically downregulated in tumors,
complicating the administration of targeted immunotherapy.
There has been abundant evidence that exposure to
demethylating agents can lead to expression of CTAs in
different tumor cell lines. Of note, this effect on CTA genes
appears to be selective, with preferential upregulation in
tumors [32], which may minimize the risk of autoimmunity.
In recent years, use of overlapping peptide library spanning
the MAGE-A proteins or NY-ESO-1 may successfully
expand CTA specific T-cells from healthy donors or patients
in vitro [33, 34]. In consideration of the fact that individual
MAGE-A expression varies from one tumor to the other, a
high-affinity heteroclitic peptide p248V9 that derived from
MAGE-A1, A2, A3, A4, A6, A10, A12 was found [35]. This
peptide may stimulate T cells that are able to recognize each
of the seven MAGE-A proteins, which will facilitate the
application of MAGE-A based adoptive immunotherapy.
As long as osteosarcoma cells express at least one of the
CTAs listed above, specific T-cells may be stimulated by
the peptide library and consequently apply immunotherapy.
DAC was proved to induce apoptosis in osteosarcoma,
and the dose used in that study was 1 μM [19], which was
the reason why we selected this dose in our in vitro study.
DAC will induce apoptosis through epigenetic mechanisms,
which are independent of known mechanisms that
conventional cytotoxic drugs take effect in osteosarcoma.
Although the single agent effect of DAC on solid tumors
appeared to be less than desirable in several clinical
trials [36–38], it may have a place in adjuvant therapy or
combination therapy [36]. DAC was already approved by

Demethylating treatment was able to induce
CTA specific CD8+ T-cell-mediated killing
against osteosarcoma in vivo
Tumor tissues in DAC treated SCID mice showed
CTA expression, which was demonstrated in western blotting
(figure 5d), while CTA was not detectable in untreated
xenografts. Albeit the expression of CTAs was so weak
that we failed in the illustration by immunohistochemistry
(not shown in this paper), we observed the target band on
the film by long exposure. The weak but indeed existing
expression of CTAs successfully induced antigen specific
CD8+ T-cell response to the tumor. Utilizing the in vivo
imaging system, we detected the bioluminescence by
luciferase-transfected tumor tissue and the fluorescence
by DiR labeled T cells. In DAC pre-treated mice, the
injected T-cells clustered at the tumor site in 24 hours,
while in mice without DAC pre-treatment, they were
only found in the lung and the liver (figure 4). The T-cells
also inhibited tumor growth in DAC pre-treated mice,
while demethylating treatment or immunotherapy alone
showed no anti-cancer effect on mice in the two groups
left (figure 5a and 5b). On the 19th day, the mean volume of
tumor xenografts in mice treated with T-cells in combination
with DAC was 388.1  mm3 (range: 172  mm3–700 mm3),
while it was 827.7  mm3 in mice without any treatment
(range: 416  mm3–1250  mm3), 878.3  mm3 in mice with
DAC treatment alone (range: 650  mm3–1090  mm3)
and 824 mm3 in mice took immunotherapy alone (range:
405 mm3–1250 mm3). The mean weight of tumor xenografts
in mice treated with both therapies was 0.261g (range:
0.190g–0.403g), and it was 0.880g in control group (range:
0.498g–1.558g), 0.841g in mice with DAC treatment alone
(range: 0.705g–0.982g) and 0.795g with T-cells alone (range:
0.435g–1.035g). These results indicate that CTA specific
adoptive immunotherapy in combination with demethylating
treatment have anti-tumor effects on osteosarcoma.

DISCUSSION
Osteosarcoma is a particularly aggressive cancer
and attempts in changing chemotherapy regimens for
poor responders have generally failed. Immunotherapy
is considered to be a promising method in treatment
against osteosarcoma, especially in adjuvant therapy.

demethylating therapy and adoptive immunotherapy against
leukemias also attracted attention. A successful induction of

was shown in 2010 [14] and, subsequently, DAC was
demonstrated to successfully enhance the MAGE-A4

Hodgkin lymphoma in 2011 [15]. Moreover, DAC was
considered to have minimal effects on T-cell phenotype and
function [15], and its effect on elevating the expression of
CTAs appeared to be selective [16, 39]. Therefore, DAC

may be utilized to increase tumor immunogenicity in CTA
specific immunotherapy.
In this study, we generated broad-spectrum CTA
specific T-cells with the peptide mix and employed
them in combination with demethylating agent DAC for
cancer treatment. Demethylating treatment enhanced
the expression of CTAs in vitro and in vivo, while other
roles related with CD8+ T-cell-mediated specific immune
response, such as major histocompatibility complex
molecules-I (MHC-I) and intercellular cell adhesion
molecule-1 (ICAM-1), were found not changed after
demethylating treatment in our study (not shown in this
paper). In studies on mice, treatment with DAC alone
didn’t show any obvious effect on inhibiting tumor growth.
This may be correlated with the low dose of DAC (1μg/g of
body weight) that we used in demethylting treatment, while
it was 2.5μg/g of body weight in the previous study [19].
Demethylating treatment facilitated the recognition of
T-cells to tumor, and consequently inhibited tumor growth.
Therefore, we hold the view that the elevated expression
of CTAs may be one of the most important elements
in enhancing CTA specific immunotherapy against
osteosarcoma. It is particularly worth mentioning that
although no distinct side effect was observed in our in vivo
study, a previous research attracted focus on the potential
risk in using broad-spectrum recognizing T-cells with
high-avidity T-cell receptors (TCRs) in clinical trials [40].
MAGE-A12 was revealed to be expressed in rare neurons,
i.e. there may be neurological toxicity in some individuals
following treatment with T-cells recognizing epitopes in
MAGE-A12 [40]. Albeit trials using T-cells recognizing
NY-ESO-1 or the other MAGE-A proteins reported good
news and no evidence was found that the other CTAs
might be expressed in normal tissues except for immuneprivileged sites, we have to be cautious enough while
using broad-spectrum recognizing T-cells in clinical
trials. Taking the previous clinical trials and our results
into consideration, we hold the view that NY-ESO-1 and
MAGE-A4 could possibly be safe and feasible targets for
T-cells in further clinical trials on osteosarcoma.
In conclusion, the results presented here indicate
that demethylating treatment with DAC against
osteosarcoma cells can lead to an obvious enhancement
in expression of CTAs, which may be brilliant targets
for adoptive immunotherapy; while MHC-I and ICAM-1
were not changed. NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A4 expression
was significantly upregulated in both cell lines, and
MAGE-A10 expression was also enhanced in U2OS. The
efficacy of DAC-mediated enhancement of CTA specific
immune response was determined by cytotoxic assays
and in vivo studies. Our results highlight the synergistic
role that demethylating treatment could play with specific
immunotherapy in the control of osteosarcoma. Targeted
immune-based treatment could be considered to be a
promising strategy for patients with relapsed or refractory
osteosarcoma.

Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines and has been approved by the authors’
institutional review board.

Cell cultures and treatment
The human osteosarcoma cell lines U2OS (CTAs
are expressed) and HOS (CTAs are undetectable) were
purchased from the Cell Collection of Chinese Academy
of Science (Shanghai, China). U2OS cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Rockville, USA), whereas
HOS cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) (Gibco). All media were supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA)
and 100μg/ml streptomycin-penicillin. All cells were
incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cells were counted and
plated in 60-mm dishes 1 day prior to treatment, and then
the media was replaced with media containing freshly
prepared DAC (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) to a final
concentration of 1 μM. Fresh medium containing DAC
was replaced every 24 hours. After incubating with DAC
for 1–7 days, the cells were harvested and counted for
further assays.

Western blot analysis
Whole-cell proteins were extracted in RIPA
buffer with proteasome inhibitor. Protein content was
quantified by the BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, USA).
Forty micrograms of whole cell lysates were separated by
10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes.
Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in
Tris-bufferd saline with Tween 20 (TBST) for 2 hours and
probed with primary antibodies diluted in TBST containing
5% milk at 4°C overnight. Blots were incubated with
antibodies against human MAGE-A (6C1; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, USA), NY-ESO-1(Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and GAPDH (Abcam, Cambridge,
USA). The anti-MAGE-A antibody 6C1 cross-reacts with
MAGE-A1, A2, A3, A4, A6, A10 and A12. The molecular
weight of MAGE-A10 is 72 kDa, and that of the rest ranges
from 45–50 kDa. Membranes were washed and incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse
secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 hour
at room temperature. Targeted proteins were visualized
using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection
system (ChemiDoc™ XRS+ imaging system; BIO-RAD,
Hercules, USA) and hyper-ECL film. Band analysis for
gray value was performed by the Quantity One software
(BIO-RAD).

Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent
(Takara, Shiga, Japan) and qualified by absorbance at
260nm. cDNA was synthesized from 1  μg of RNA by
Takara RNA PCR kit (Takara) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using a SYBR
GREEN Master Mix (Takara) on ABI StepOnePlus System
(Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Primer sequences
used are listed in Table 1. Samples were performed in
triplicate and averaged. The relative expression level of
genes was normalized to the value of GAPDH by delta-delta
cycle threshold (ΔΔCT) method, allowing the calculation
of differences in gene expression using the ABI software.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were obtained from volunteers and isolated by Ficoll
gradient centrifugation. Immaure dentritic cells (DCs)
were generated from adherent cells cultured for 5 days in
presence of 1000U/ml GM-CSF and 10ng/ml IL-4 (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, USA) in complete medium (RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2μM glutamine
and antibiotics). DCs were matured on day 5 using a
cocktail consisting of 10ng/ml TNF-α, 10ng/ml IL-1β,
10ng/ml IL-6 (Gibco), and 1ug/ml PGE-2 (Sigma). From
day 7, mature DCs were pulsed with multi-MAGE-A

(SLLMWITQC) (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China),
and subsequently used as antigen-presenting cells (APC)
to stimulate CTA specific T-cells in the presence of
10ng/ml IL-7, 10ng/ml IL-15 and 50U/ml IL-2 (Gibco).
The cultures were replaced weekly, and after two weeks,
cells were harvested and counted.

of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University. All animal
procedures were approved by the local Committee for
Animal Experiments. For the purpose of in vivo imaging,
HOS cells transfected with luciferase (HOS-Luc) and
T-cells labeled with XenoLight DiR (Caliper life sciences,
Hopkinton, USA) were used in the animal studies.
HOS-Luc cells (5 × 106 in 200μl PBS) were injected
subcutaneously near the scapula of the SCID mice. To test
the induction of CTAs in tumor xenografts after DAC
treatment at 1μg/g of body weight [41] (dissolved in
PBS and injected intraperitoneally every day for 5 days,
starting at the 7th day after injection of tumor cells), three
mice were sacrificed after the final DAC injection. The
tumor tissues were frozen with liquid nitrogen for western
blotting. To examine the treatment efficacy of CTA
specific T-cells in combination with DAC, we separated
the mice randomly into 4 groups, each of which contained
6 mice. They were all injected with tumor cells one week
before. Tumors were measured with caliper every two
days. Among the 4 groups, group I were set as control,
group II were mice treated with DAC and saline, group III
with PBS and T-cells, and group IV with both DAC and
T-cells. DAC dissolved in PBS or PBS alone was injected
intraperitoneally every day. After 5 days, drug treatment
was over and mice started to receive i.v. injection of in
vitro generated CTA specific T-cells (50 × 106 in 100μl
PBS) or PBS every two days. On the 13th day, i.e. the day
after the first injection of T-cells, mice of group C and
group D took isoflurane inhalation and were then imaged
with an In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS Lumina Series III,
Caliper life sciences). The whole treatment was finished
on the 19th day, and all mice were sacrificed by cervical
dislocation after isoflurane inhalation. The tumor tissues
were then measured and weighed. The approximate
volume of tumor was calculated using the formula
V = a × b2/2, where a is the maximal diameter of the
tumor, and b is the minimal diameter.

Flow cytometry phenotyping
In vitro generated DCs were assessed for surface
expression using fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal
antibodies: PE conjugated anti-human CD1a, PE conjugated
anti-human CD11c, FITC conjugated anti-human CD83 and
APC conjugated anti-human HLA-DR (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, USA). DCs were harvested and washed with
cold PBS, and antibodies were added to bind at 4°C for
20 minutes in the dark. Then cells were washed twice
with PBS for flow cytometry, performed with FACSCanto
(BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. Data were analyzed with
FlowJo software.

IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot analysis
The specificity of generated CTA specific
CD8+ T-cells was evaluated by IFN-γ enzyme-linked
immunospot analysis (ELIspot). Cells were plated in
triplicates at 50,000 cells per well of anti-IFN-γ capture
antibodies coated plates. Multi-MAGE-A peptide and
NY-ESO-1 peptide mixes were then added onto cells on
each well, and irrelevant peptides were used as negative
control. IFN-γ release was assessed, and spot forming cells
were counted.

Cytotoxic assay
MTS assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxic effects
of in vitro generated CTA specific T-cells on osteosarcoma
cells. Osteosarcoma cells were plated in triplicate into
96-well plates at 1 × 103, 2 × 103 and 6 × 103 cells/well
for 5 days, 3 days and 1 day DAC treatment respectively.
Cultures containing DAC were replaced every day. Upon
completion of DAC treatment, all cultures were replaced
with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS,
and T-cells were added at 2 × 105/well. After incubation
for 4 hours, the supernatant was removed, and all wells
were washed with PBS softly twice to remove the T-cells.
The percentage of survived cells was measured using the
MTS assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and quantified by determining the optical density using a
microplate reader.

Statistical analysis
Student’s t test was applied for statistical comparison
among data of in vitro studies. Differences among results
of in vivo studies were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis
H-test followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison tests.
P < .05 was considered significant.
