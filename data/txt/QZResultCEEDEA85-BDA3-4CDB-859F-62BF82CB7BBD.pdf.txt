Abstract
Activation of the β-catenin and receptor kinase pathways occurs often in medulloblastoma, the most
common pediatric malignant brain tumor. In this study, we show that molecular cross-talk between the
β-catenin and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways is crucial to sustain medulloblastoma pathophysiology. Constitutive activation of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), Akt,
and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) was detected by immunohistochemistry in all primary medulloblastomas examined (n = 41). Small-molecule inhibitors targeting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway affected
β-catenin signaling by inhibition of GSK-3β activity, resulting in cytoplasmic retention of β-catenin and reduced
expression of its target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc. The PDK1 inhibitor OSU03012 induced mitochondrialdependent apoptosis of medulloblastoma cells and enhanced the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs
in a synergistic or additive manner. In vivo, OSU03012 inhibited the growth of established medulloblastoma
xenograft tumors in a dose-dependent manner and augmented the antitumor effects of mammalian target
of rapamycin inhibitor CCI-779. These findings demonstrate the importance of cross-talk between the PI3K/
Akt and β-catenin pathways in medulloblastoma and rationalize the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in treatment of this disease. Cancer Res; 70(1); 266–76. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Medulloblastoma, a primitive neuroectodermal tumor, is
the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. Medulloblastoma can originate from cerebellar granule neural precursor cells located in the external granule layer (1, 2) and
typically develop in the cerebellum. Medulloblastoma cells
retain many features that resemble the progenitor cells of
the embryonic brain (2), and more than half of these tumors display abnormal activation of the Hedgehog or Wnt
signaling pathways (3), supporting a model of embryonal
tumorigenesis.
Wnt signaling plays a central role in modulating the balance between proliferation and differentiation of progenitor
cells during embryonic central nervous system development
(4). The canonical Wnt signaling pathway operates by stabilizing β-catenin. In the absence of Wnt/Wingless ligand

activation, β-catenin is sequestered in the cytoplasm by a
multiprotein complex, which encompasses the adenomatous
polyposis coli protein, axin1, axin2/conductin, casein kinase
1, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). In this state,
β-catenin is phosphorylated at the NH2-terminal serine and
threonine residues by GSK-3β, which targets it for ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation (5). Activation of Wnt signaling by binding of Wnt ligands to a Frizzled receptor
inhibits the formation of the multiprotein complex and
GSK-3β–mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin, resulting
in an accumulation of hypophosphorylated β-catenin in the
cytosol. Stabilized hypophosphorylated β-catenin eventually
translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with members
of the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor (TCF/
LEF) family of transcription factors, leading to modulated
expression of a broad range of genes, such as MYC and
CCND1 (6, 7).
Proteins regulating signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway are frequently altered
in human cancer, including medulloblastoma (8, 9). Activated Akt significantly augments Sonic-Hedgehog–induced
medulloblastoma formation in mice (10). Activation of
the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is important for proliferation of human medulloblastoma cells and cancer stem
cells residing in the perivascular niche following irradiation
(11, 12). Moreover, medulloblastomas frequently display reduced expression of the Akt inhibitor PTEN (the tumor
suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on
chromosome 10) caused by promoter hypermethylation

and allelic losses on chromosome region 10q23 where
PTEN is localized (8, 13).
PI3Ks are key components for the activation of Akt signaling
by catalyzing the generation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5trisphosphate (PIP3) from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
(PIP2). PIP3 translocates Akt and phosphoinositide-dependent
protein kinase 1 (PDK1) from the cytoplasm to the inner cytoplasmic membrane where Akt is activated through phosphorylation by PDK1. This process is attenuated by PTEN, which
removes the 3′-phosphate group of PIP3, resulting in the regeneration of PIP2 and decreased Akt activity (8). Activated Akt
phosphorylates a plethora of downstream substrates involved
in the regulation of cell survival, cell cycle progression, and
cellular growth (10).
In this study, we evaluated the importance of PI3K/Akt signaling in medulloblastomas using small-molecule inhibitors
and show that molecular cross-talk between PI3K/Akt and
Wnt/β-catenin signaling is significant in medulloblastoma
tumorigenesis.

Materials and Methods
Tumor material and patient characteristics. Human tumor tissue samples were collected at the Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden, between 1994 and 2005. Ethical
approval was obtained by the Karolinska University Hospital
Research Ethics Committee. Tumor and patient characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Detection of phospho-PDK1Ser241 (Abcam), phospho-AktSer473,
phospho-AktThr308, phospho-GSK-3βSer9, and β-catenin in
pri mary t umor samples was performed using the
corresponding specific antibodies (Cell Signaling). Sections
from xenograft tumors were incubated with the primary antibodies detecting Ki-67 (NeoMarkers) or active caspase-3
(R&D Systems). As a secondary antibody, the horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) SuperPicture Polymer detection kit and
matched isotype controls were used (Zymed Laboratories,
Inc.). Proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3)
were quantified as described (14).
For immunofluorescence analysis, medulloblastoma cells
were treated with 1.5 to 3.0 μmol/L of OSU03012 for 6 h
and then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody
detecting β-catenin (Cell Signaling). Detection was performed using secondary biotinylated antibody and FITCconjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories).
Chemicals. 2-Amino-N(4-5-(2-phenanthrenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]phenyl)-acetamide (OSU03012),
LY294002 (Cell Signaling), SB-216763, doxorubicin and vincristine (Sigma-Aldrich), and CHIR99021 (Stemgent) were
dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich). Rapamycin (sirolimus,
LC Laboratories) and CCI-779 (temsirolimus, Wyeth) were
dissolved in 99.5% ethanol. Temozolomide and cyclophosphamide were supplied by the local pharmacy (Apoteket
AB) and diluted in PBS to the appropriate stock concentrations. Sodium nitroprusside dihydrate (SNP; Sigma-Aldrich)
was dissolved in distilled water. All inhibitors were further
diluted in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) to the desired

www.aacrjournals.org

in vitro concentration. For in vivo use of CCI-779, the stock
was diluted in 5% polyethylene glycol 400 (Sigma-Aldrich),
5% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad), and 0.9% sterile saline, whereas OSU03012 for oral administration was prepared as a
suspension in a vehicle fluid consisting of 0.5% (w/v)
methylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80
(Sigma-Aldrich) in sterile water.
Cell lines and viability assays. Origin, culturing conditions, and viability assays of human medulloblastoma and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal (sPNET) cell lines
were as described (14).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. DNA content was assessed essentially as described (15). Briefly,
D283 MED, D324 MED, PFSK-1, D458 MED, UW228-3, and
MEB-MED-8A cells were treated with 3 μmol/L OSU03012
for 24 and 48 h; stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich); and subjected to cell cycle analysis
using single-parameter DNA flow cytometry. The mitochondrial transmembrane potential was assessed in D283 MED,
D324 MED, PFSK-1, D458 MED, UW228-3, and MEB-MED-8A
cells after 24-h incubation with 3 μmol/L OSU03012 using
tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (Molecular Probes) as
described (16).
Protein fractionation, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting. Fractionated nuclear and cytosolic protein lysates were obtained using nuclear extraction buffer [20
mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 420 mmol/L NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L
MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/L EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1
mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF)] or hypotonic lysis buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.9), 60 mmol/L KCl, 0.3% NP40, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1
mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L PMSF], respectively. Total cell
protein lysates were extracted from cells in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [25 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.8), 2
mmol/L EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.1% NP40, 1 mmol/L DTT].
Frozen tumors were disrupted with a rotor-stator homogenizer in TNEN buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250
mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% NP40, 5 mmol/L EDTA] and subjected
to five freeze-thaw cycles (liquid nitrogen, 37°C, before
clearing by centrifugation). All protein extraction buffers
were supplemented with MiniComplete protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche Diagnostic), 1 mmol/L NaF, and 1 mmol/L
NaO3V4. Proteins were immunoprecipitated using axin1
antibodies (Cell Signaling) coupled to agarose A beads following the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma-Aldrich). Immunoblotting was performed using antibodies detecting
phospho-PDK1Ser241, phospho-AktSer473, phospho-AktThr308,
phospho-S6K1Thr389, phospho-4E-BP1Ser65, phospho-GSK3βSer9, phospho-β-cateninSer33/37/Thr41, Akt, β-catenin, caspase-9, caspase-3, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP),
the BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID), cyclin
D1, c-Myc (all from Cell Signaling), and β-actin (SigmaAldrich). Anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG, conjugated
with HRP (Pharmacia Biosciences), were used as secondary
antibodies. SuperSignal (Pierce) was used for chemiluminescent detection.
Transfection, small interfering RNA knockdown, and
luciferase reporter gene assays. Cells were transfected with

a LEF/TCF reporter kit, including negative and positive
controls (SA Biosciences) and/or the full-length cDNA of βcatenin (pSPORTβ-cat; Open Biosystems) using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) for 48 h. Cells were then treated for 6 h with
3 μmol/L OSU03012, and reporter gene activity was assessed
using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega
Biotech AB). GSK-3β knockdown was achieved using the
SignalSilence GSK-3α/β kit (Cell Signaling) according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
Xenografts and in vivo administration of OSU03012
and CCI-779. Four- to 6-wk-old female NMRI nu/nu mice
were s.c. injected with 7 × 106 human D283 MED medulloblastoma cells. Mice were randomly assigned into six treatment groups (eight mice in each treatment group) and the
drugs were given in daily doses as follows: (a) 7 mg/kg
OSU03012 or (b) 70 mg/kg OSU03012 orally via a gastric feeding tube, (c) 20 mg/kg CCI-779 i.p., (d) 7 mg/kg OSU03012
and 20 mg/kg CCI-779 i.p., (e) 70 mg/kg OSU03012 and
20 mg/kg CCI-779 i.p., or (f) no treatment. Each mouse was
treated for 8 d and treatment was started on the appearance
of palpable tumors (mean, 0.13 mL). All animal experiments
were approved by the regional ethics committee for animal
research (N234-05) in accordance with national regulations
(SFS 1988:534, SFS 1988:539, and SFS 1988:541).
Statistical analysis. Calculation of EC50 values and testing
for synergistic or additive effects of combination therapy
were performed as previously described (15, 17). MannWhitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test (nonparametric
ANOVA) followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test were
used for analysis of statistical differences between two and
several independent populations, respectively. All statistical
tests were two-sided.

Results
Key molecules in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway are
constitutively activated in primary medulloblastomas. By
immunohistochemical analysis of primary human medulloblastoma and sPNET tumor samples (Supplementary
Table S1), specific phosphorylation of PDK1Ser241, AktThr308,
and AktSer473 was detected in the cytoplasm of all primary
tumor samples (Fig. 1). Interestingly, GSK-3β was also phosphorylated Ser9 in all primary tumor samples analyzed
(Fig. 1), whereas nuclear accumulation of β-catenin was detected in 27% of the cases. Thirty-one percent of the samples
had mixed cytoplasmic/nuclear β-catenin staining (Fig. 1;
Supplementary Table S1).
Inhibition of PDK1 using the small-molecule inhibitor
OSU03012 potently suppresses medulloblastoma cell proliferation and clonogenic capacity. OSU03012, a thirdgeneration celecoxib derivative, has been shown to affect
PI3K/Akt signal transduction through inhibition of PDK1
phosphorylation (18).
As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment of medulloblastoma cells
with 3 μmol/L OSU03012 resulted in reduced phosphorylation of PDK1Ser241, AktThr308, and AktSer473.
All medulloblastoma cell lines showed a concentrationdependent decrease in cell viability (Fig. 2B) and significant

268

dose-dependent inhibition of colony formation (P < 0.001;
Fig. 2C) after 48-hour exposure of OSU03012. Concentrations associated with 50% decrease in cell viability (biological EC50) ranged from 1.13 to 7.23 μmol/L (mean, 2.47
μmol/L; Supplementary Table S2).
OSU03012 induces S-phase arrest followed by apoptosis
in medulloblastoma cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed a pronounced S-phase arrest that was evident after both 24-hour
and 48-hour incubation with 3 μmol/L OSU03012 in D283
MED and D324 MED cells (see also Supplementary Fig.
S1A–E). We also observed an accumulation of cells with a hypodiploid DNA content (sub-G1). This was most pronounced
in MEB-MED-8A, D458 MED, and PFSK-1 cells incubated
with 3 μmol/L OSU03012 (Supplementary Fig. S1C–E).
Depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential
was detected in all medulloblastoma cell lines on treatment
with OSU03012 (Supplementary Fig. S2A–E). Western blotting confirmed activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP,
whereas no activation of BID was observed in any of the five
medulloblastoma cell lines investigated (Fig. 2D).
OSU03012 significantly augments the cytotoxic effect of
chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro. To further investigate
OSU03012 as a potential drug in the treatment of medulloblastoma, we studied the effects of OSU03012 in combination
with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors or
conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. D324 MED and D283
MED cells were treated with increasing concentrations of
OSU03012, mTOR inhibitors, and chemotherapeutic drugs.
The activities of the individual cytostatic drugs were determined in initial experiments (data not shown). Fixed concentration ratios of the drugs were used with serial dilutions for
combination and single-drug treatments. The results are
summarized in Table 1, which shows the combination index
(CI) at IC50. OSU03012 induced a synergistic or additive effect
in D324 MED and D283 MED cells when used in combination
with CCI-779 (IC50, 0.57–0.80; 0.78–0.94), rapamycin (IC50,
0.57–0.83; 0.88–0.92), cyclophosphamide (IC 50, 0.45–0.62;
0.56–0.99), or doxorubicin (IC50, 0.97–1.12; 0.75–1.00). In contrast, OSU03012 in combination with vincristine had an additive effect in D283 MED cells (IC50, 0.98–1.20), whereas an
antagonistic effect was observed in D324 MED cells (IC50,
1.01–1.35). OSU03012 in combination with temozolomide
had an antagonistic effect in both cell lines at the doses used
(IC50, 1.18–1.38; 1.07–1.30).
Furthermore, a combination of OSU03012 and the mTOR
inhibitor CCI-779 significantly augmented inhibition of the
clonogenic capacity of D324 MED, PFSK-1, and UW228-3
cells compared with single-drug treatment (P < 0.001; all cell
lines; Supplementary Fig. S3).
Effects of OSU03012 on Akt downstream proteins in medulloblastoma cells. The cell viability assays showed a synergistic induction of cell cytotoxicity when medulloblastoma
cells were treated with a combination of OSU03012 and the
mTOR inhibitors rapamycin or CCI-779 (Table 1). However, increased levels of AktSer473 phosphorylation were observed in
both D324 MED and D283 MED cells treated with CCI-779. This
activation of Akt was inhibited with concomitant treatment of
the cells with OSU03012 (Fig. 3A). Both OSU03012 and CCI-779

reduced the phosphorylation of the mTOR downstream targets S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (Fig. 3B).
OSU03012 has profound effects on the growth of established medulloblastoma xenografts. Athymic mice carrying
established D283 MED xenografts were treated with either
7 or 70 mg/kg of OSU03012 by daily oral gavages. Tumor
growth was significantly inhibited after treatment for 2
days with 70 mg/kg/d OSU03012 (P < 0.005) or 4 days with
7 mg/kg/d OSU03012 (P < 0.05) compared with untreated
controls (Fig. 4A–C). At the end of treatment, tumor volumes
were reduced by 66% or 40% in mice receiving 70 or 7 mg/kg/d,
respectively, compared with controls. Significant elevated
activated caspase-3 (P < 0.0001) expression and reduced
expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 (P < 0.0001)
were detected in tumors from mice treated with OSU03012
(Fig. 4D).
OSU03012 augments the effect of the mTOR inhibitor
CCI-779 on medulloblastoma growth in vivo. Because both
OSU03012 and CCI-779 inhibit components in the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and had synergistic cytotoxic
effects on medulloblastoma cells in vitro (Table 1), we examined the in vivo activity of these drugs in combination.
CCI-779 significantly inhibited the growth of established
medulloblastoma tumors from day 2 of treatment (P <
0.05), and the tumor volume was reduced by 65% compared with controls at the end of treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4A–C). However, CCI-779 in combination with 7

www.aacrjournals.org

or 70 mg/kg/d of OSU03012 reduced the tumor growth by
73% or 75%, respectively, compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B).
PDK1 inhibition by OSU03012 downregulates cyclin
D1 and c-Myc protein expression in medulloblastoma via
activation of GSK-3β and inhibition of β-catenin function.
Incubation of medulloblastoma cells with OSU03012 or the
PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibited phosphorylation of GSK3βSer9 (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S7).
Subcellular protein fractionation and immunofluorescence cytology showed that medulloblastoma cell lines
contained significant levels of β-catenin in the nucleus that
was reduced in a dose-dependent manner on treatment
with increasing concentrations of OSU03012 (Fig. 5B).
OSU03012 induced β-catenin phosphorylation and reduced
the protein levels of c-Myc and cyclin D1 (Fig. 5A). Similarly,
treatment of medulloblastoma cells with the PI3K inhibitor
LY294002 also resulted in reduced expression of cyclin D1
and c-Myc, whereas concomitant treatment of medulloblastoma cells with OSU03012 and the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779
resulted in an almost complete suppression of cyclin D1
and c-Myc expression (Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7).
OSU03012 significantly inhibited β-catenin–TCF/LEF transactivation in D324 MED and D283 MED cells (P < 0.001;
Fig. 5C). Forced overexpression of β-catenin by cotransfection
with a β-catenin expression plasmid (pSPORTβ-cat) was also
inhibited by OSU03012 (Fig. 5C).

with 3 μmol/L OSU03012 for 0.5, 6, or 24 h, and protein extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis to detect phosphorylated PDK1Ser241,

CHIR99021; P < 0.001, SB-216763), whereas the GSK-3β activator SNP significantly increased the toxic effects of
OSU03012 (P < 0.01). CHIR99021 and SB-216763 increased
GSK-3βSer9 phosphorylation and c-Myc protein expression
in OSU03012-treated medulloblastoma cells. SNP treatment
resulted in decreased GSK-3βSer9 phosphorylation and reduced c-Myc expression (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Moreover,
OSU03012 treatment of medulloblastoma cells resulted in increased binding of GSK-3β to axin1 compared with nontreated cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Similar small
interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of GSK-3β inhibited
the cytotoxic effect of OSU03012 and increased c-Myc expression in D324 MED and D283 MED cells (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Fig. S5C).
Finally, decreased phosphorylation of PDK1Ser241 and GSK3βSer9 and decreased levels of β-catenin, cyclin D1, and
c-Myc proteins were observed in D283 MED xenografts
treated with OSU03012 (Supplementary Fig. S8).

Discussion
Recent studies indicate that numerous components of the
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway are frequent targets for amplification, translocations, and mutations in cancer, resulting in
activation of the pathway (8). In medulloblastoma, activation
of PI3K/Akt signaling seems to be a frequent event because
the majority of primary medulloblastomas exhibit phosphorylation of AktSer473 independent of histologic staging (9, 19,
20). In this study, we show that PDK1, a protein regulating
the phosphorylation, and thereby Akt are constitutively
activated in primary medulloblastomas (Fig. 1). Moreover,
GSK-3β, a protein that is constitutively active in resting
cells (21), was found to be functionally inactivated by phosphorylation in all of the primary medulloblastomas analyzed
(Fig. 1). Similarly, phosphorylation of GSK-3β Ser9 was
detected by Western blot in three of six primary medulloblastomas. However, no increased phosphorylation of
PDK1 and only weak activation of Akt were detected in
these samples (22).

Medulloblastoma cells exhibit increased expression of
several growth factor receptors that may transmit their
signals through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, such as
the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor (23), plateletderived growth factor B (24, 25), tyrosine receptor kinase
B (26), the chemokine receptor (CXCR4; ref. 27), the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (28), and c-KIT (29).
The importance of PI3K/Akt signaling in cancer cells has
resulted in an intense search for agents that specifically
inhibit key components of this pathway. Several of these
compounds show promising preclinical antitumor effects,
and a few of them are already in clinical trials (30). In
contrast to PI3Ks or Akt for which several subunits or
isoforms exist, only one single isoform of PDK1 has been
reported in humans. PDK1 has high specificity for phosphorylation and activation of all three Akt isoforms
(PBKα/Akt1, PBKβ/Akt2, and PBKγ/Akt3). PDK1 hypomorphic mice display no deleterious phenotype, and the
formation of PTEN-deficient tumors is abrogated when
PDK1 hypomorphic mice are crossed with PTEN heterozygote mice. Taken together, this makes PDK1 an attractive
candidate as an anticancer drug target (30, 31). Celecoxib,
a drug designed to specifically inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenase-2, has shown promising effects as an anticancer agent. One of the most prominent off-target
effects of celecoxib is the specific inhibition of PDK1 activity possibly by competing with ATP for binding to
PDK1 (32). OSU03012 was isolated by structure-based optimization of celecoxib for compounds lacking cyclooxygenase-2 activity but retaining PDK1-inhibiting activity
(18). We have recently shown that celecoxib inhibits
medulloblastoma growth both in vitro and in vivo (14).
We therefore investigated the effects of OSU03012 on
medulloblastoma cells both at the molecular level and
as a potential future drug in the treatment of this disease. We observed that OSU03012 potently modulated
the effect of key molecules in the PI3K/Akt signaling
pathway (Fig. 2A). Cytotoxic effects of OSU03012 on
a panel of medulloblastoma cell lines revealed that
OSU03012 was significantly more potent compared with

Figure 3. PDK1 inhibition abolishes CCI-779–mediated increase of Akt phosphorylation and inactivates the function of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 in
medulloblastoma cells. A and B, D324 MED and D283 MED cells were incubated with 3 μmol/L OSU03012, 6 μmol/L CCI-779, or a combination of 3 μmol/L
OSU03012 and 6 μmol/L CCI-779. Protein extracts were isolated after 6- and 24-h incubation and subjected to Western blotting using antibodies to
detect phosphorylated AktSer473, total Akt, phosphorylated S6K1Thr389, and phosphorylated 4E-BP1Ser65. β-Actin was used to ensure equal protein loading.

the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs celecoxib or
diclofenac in inducing cytotoxicity of medulloblastoma
cells (Fig. 2B and C; Supplementary Table S2; ref. 14).
The growth-inhibitory effect of OSU03012 was associated
with induction of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis of
medulloblastoma cells (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S2).
Cell cycle analysis showed an S-phase arrest in D283
MED and D324 MED cells, whereas no evident S-phase
arrest was observed for MEB-MED-8A, D458 MED, or
PFSK-1 cells treated with OSU03012. The observed Sphase arrest may be due to OSU03012-mediated downregulation of G1-S phase–specific cyclin D1 expression
(Fig. 5A). Others have reported a combination of caspasedependent and caspase-independent mechanisms for
OSU03012-mediated induction of tumor cell death (33–35).
Recently, OSU03012 was reported to induce autophagy
through accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
hepatocellular carcinoma (36). This is particularly interesting because Akt, in contrast to its ability to inhibit apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents, is not able to
inhibit ROS-mediated apoptosis (37).
Our results show that OSU03012 augmented the cytotoxic
effects of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs in a synergistic or additive manner (Table 1). Similarly, inhibition of the
catalytic PI3K p110α isoform enhances the effect of doxorubicin in medulloblastoma cells (38). Because the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 has been shown to have prominent effects on
preclinical medulloblastoma models and is currently undergoing clinical testing in medulloblastoma patients (39, 40),
we focused on this agent in more detail. A potential dilemma
when designing anticancer therapies using agents that inhibit
mTOR is that mTOR inhibitors have been shown to activate
Akt through a feedback loop (15). However, our data show
that a combination of OSU03012 and CCI-779 inhibits Akt
and acts synergistically to induce medulloblastoma cell cytotoxicity in vitro (Table 1). Therefore, treatment with agents

272

Cancer Res; 70(1) January 1, 2010

that simultaneously target key components in the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathway may prove to be more efficacious.
Nuclear transactivation and activity of β-catenin has been
directly related to signaling through the Wnt pathway, and this
coordinates a diverse array of developmental processes, including the proliferation and fate of neural progenitor cells
(5). Wnt signaling has emerged as an important step in human
oncogenesis, and ∼15% of sporadic medulloblastomas contain
mutations in proteins of the Wnt pathway (41–43). In contrast,
∼25% of children with medulloblastoma have nucleopositive
β-catenin (44). Clearly, there must be other mechanisms involved in regulating β-catenin activation. Indeed, it has been
shown that β-catenin–mediated transactivation of TCF/LEF
can be activated by growth factors such as EGF, hepatocyte
growth factor, IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin (45–48). We found that
treatment of medulloblastoma cells with OSU03012 diminished the amount of nuclear β-catenin and induced β-catenin
phosphorylation of NH2-terminal serine and threonine residues followed by decreased TCF/LEF transactivation. Treatment also reduced the expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc
(Fig. 5), two proteins that are important in medulloblastoma
tumorigenesis (49). Inhibition of nuclear β-catenin translocation is likely to be due to the observed OSU03012-mediated inhibition of Akt activity, leading to activation of GSK-3β
function, because activated Akt has been shown to effectively
suppress the role of GSK-3β in regulating the degradation of
β-catenin (25, 50). This is supported by the findings that the
GSK-3β activator SNP significantly increased the cytotoxic effects of OSU03012, whereas the GSK-3β inhibitors CHIR99021
and SB-216763 or siRNA knockdown of GSK-3β inhibited
OSU03012-mediated medulloblastoma cell death (Fig. 5D). Attenuation of GSK-3β phosphorylation, growth, and survival
has also been shown in medulloblastoma cells treated with
the IGF-I receptor inhibitor NVP-AEW541 (23).
These results suggest that molecular cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and the Wnt signaling pathways

exists in medulloblastoma and that GSK-3β is the
key enzyme bridging these pathways. Furthermore, we
also show that OSU03012 inhibits the phosphorylation
of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (Fig. 3), two proteins located

downstream in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
Both proteins have important functions in regulating
protein translation and thereby cell growth and proliferation (8).

Figure 5. PDK1 inhibition of medulloblastoma cells results in impaired β-catenin function and downregulation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc proteins. A, effect of
OSU03012 on proteins involved in Wnt pathway signaling in medulloblastoma cells. D324 MED, PFSK-1, D283 MED, and MEB-MED-8A medulloblastoma
cells were treated with 3 μmol/L OSU03012 for 0.5, 6, or 24 h. Immunoblotting was used to detect phospho-GSK-3βSer9, total GSK-3β, phospho-βcateninSer33/37/Thr41, total β-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-Myc. β-Actin was used to ensure equal loading. B, PDK1 inhibition by OSU03012 prevents nuclear
translocation of β-catenin in medulloblastoma cells. D324 MED cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of OSU03012 for 6 or 24 h, and
the cellular location of β-catenin was detected using immunofluorescence (top) or Western blotting of subcellular fractionated protein extracts (bottom).

transactivation activity in D324 MED and D283 MED medulloblastoma cells treated with OSU03012 or no treatment. Cotransfection with pSPORTβ-cat
induced strong TCF/LEF transactivation, which is inhibited by OSU03012. D, effect of GSK-3β inhibitors, activators, and GSK-3β siRNA knockdown on

inhibitors CHIR99021 or SB-216763 as single treatment or in combination with OSU03012 for 48 h, and cell survival was measured using MTT assay. Cells
transfected with either scrambled or GSK-3β siRNA for 48 h were counted by trypan blue dye exclusion to evaluate cell viability.

Because limited information about the in vivo antitumorigenic effects of OSU03012 is available, we investigated
the effects of OSU03012 on established human medulloblastoma xenografts in nude mice. We found that

(Fig. 4D). OSU03012 also augmented the antitumor effect
of the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 (Supplementary Fig.
S4A–C).
Taken together, our data show that molecular cross-talk
between two of the major molecular mechanisms controlling embryonic development, the receptor tyrosine kinase
PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway and the canonical
Wnt/β-catenin pathway, is important in medulloblastoma.
We also show that small-molecule inhibitors targeting
key components in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may
represent an approach for the treatment of medulloblastoma and that the effect of OSU03012 should be further
investigated in a clinical setting.

Correction

Correction: Small-Molecule Inhibitors of
Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/Akt Signaling
Inhibit Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway Cross-Talk
and Suppress Medulloblastoma Growth
In this article (Cancer Res 2010;70:266–76), which was published in the January 1,
2010 issue of Cancer Research (1), there are a number of errors. There are errors
in the third and fourth sentences of the abstract; the sentences should read as
follows:
“Constitutive activation of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1
(PDK1), Akt, and phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β)
was detected by immunohistochemistry in all primary medulloblastomas examined (n = 41). Small-molecule inhibitors targeting the PI3K/Akt signaling
pathway affected β-catenin signaling by activation of GSK-3β, resulting in cytoplasmic retention of β-catenin and reduced expression of its target genes cyclin
D1 and c-Myc.”
In the final sentence of the fourth paragraph of the Results section, “median”
should appear instead of “mean”. In the paragraph “PDK1 inhibition by OSU03012
downregulates cyclin D1 and c-Myc protein expression in medulloblastoma via
activation of GSK-3β and inhibition of β-catenin function” on page 269, the
Supplementary Figure referenced should be S6, not S7.
The first two sentences of the Fig. 4 legend should read as follows:
“OSU03012 impairs medulloblastoma growth in vivo. NMRI nu/nu mice engrafted
with 7 × 106 D283 MED cells s.c. were randomized to receive either 7 mg/kg/d (n = 8)
or 70 mg/kg/d (n = 8) through gastric feeding for 8 d or no treatment (n = 8). A,
comparison of tumor volume indexes from mice treated with 7 mg/kg/d
OSU03012 and untreated controls.”
The legend for Fig. 4D should read as follows:
“D, immunohistochemical staining of untreated xenograft tumors (left column)
or xenografts from mice treated with 70 mg/kg/d OSU03012 (middle column).
Proliferation was detected by Ki-67 (top row; ×400 magnification) and apoptosis
by cleaved caspase-3 (bottom row; ×400 magnification). Quantification (right
column) of proliferation and apoptosis of xenografts from mice treated with
2 mg OSU03012. Bars, SD.”
Finally, there are errors in Figs. 3 and 5D; the corrected figures appear below.
