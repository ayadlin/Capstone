Abstract
Tasidotin (ILX-651), an orally active synthetic microtubuletargeted derivative of the marine depsipeptide dolastatin-15,
is currently undergoing clinical evaluation for cancer treatment. Tasidotin inhibited proliferation of MCF7/GFP breast
cancer cells with an IC50 of 63 nmol/L and inhibited mitosis
with an IC50 of 72 nmol/L in the absence of detectable effects
on spindle microtubule polymer mass. Tasidotin inhibited the
polymerization of purified tubulin into microtubules weakly
(IC50 f 30 Mmol/L). However, it strongly suppressed the
dynamic instability behavior of the microtubules at their plus
ends at concentrations f5 to 10 times below those required to
inhibit polymerization. Its major actions were to reduce the
shortening rate, the switching frequency from growth to
shortening (catastrophe frequency), and the fraction of time
the microtubules grew. In contrast with all other microtubuletargeted drugs thus far examined that can inhibit polymerization, tasidotin did not inhibit the growth rate. In contrast to
stabilizing plus ends, tasidotin enhanced microtubule dynamic instability at minus ends, increasing the shortening
length, the fraction of time the microtubules shortened, and
the catastrophe frequency and reducing the rescue frequency.
Tasidotin C-carboxylate, the major intracellular metabolite of
tasidotin, altered dynamic instability of purified microtubules
in a qualitatively similar manner to tasidotin but was 10 to
30 times more potent. The results suggest that the principal
mechanism by which tasidotin inhibits cell proliferation is by
suppressing spindle microtubule dynamics. Tasidotin may be
a relatively weak prodrug for the functionally active tasidotin
C-carboxylate. [Cancer Res 2007;67(8):3767–76]

Introduction
Antimitotic peptides and depsipeptides are microtubule-targeted
compounds that are receiving considerable attention for the possible treatment of cancer. Originally isolated as natural products
from marine sources, they are linear structures composed of five to
seven amino acid residues. The depsipeptide dolastatin-15 (Fig. 1),
initially isolated from the Indian Ocean sea hare, inhibits proliferation of human malignant cell lines in vitro and is active in a
broad range of animal tumor models (1–3). Dolastatin-15 inhibits
cell cycle progression at mitosis and seems to target microtubules

and their tubulin subunits (2, 4). A synthetic analogue of dolastatin15, cemadotin (LU103793), has been evaluated in phase I and II
clinical trials for the possible treatment of cancer (5, 6). Whereas
several patients achieved stable disease, there were no objective
responses, and the drug caused significant toxicities, most notably,
hypertension (5).
Because of their attractive therapeutic potential, a new generation of dolastatins represented by tasidotin (N,N-dimethylL-valyl-L-valyl-N-methyl-L-valyl-L-prolyl-L-proline-tert-butylamide
hydrochloride, formerly ILX651; Fig. 1) was developed that possesses
several advantages over earlier dolastatins (7, 8). Preclinical studies
in which the cell growth–inhibitory activity of tasidotin was
analyzed in human tumor cell lines using a standard tetrazolium
dye/growth inhibition assay, including K562 erythroid-leukemia
(IC50, 20 nmol/L), OVCAR-3 ovarian carcinoma (IC50, 60 nmol/L),
HT-29 colon carcinoma (IC50, 60 nmol/L), H460 lung carcinoma
(IC50, 0.5 Amol/L), and LOX melanoma (IC50, 1 Amol/L), indicated
that tasidotin possesses good cytotoxic activity against a wide range
of solid tumor cells.4 In mouse xenograft models, tasidotin induced
complete responses in early- and late-stage breast carcinoma, melanoma, and prostate cancer. In the P388 murine leukemia model,
tasidotin significantly increased survival time (9). Importantly,
toxicity studies in rats and dogs showed that tasidotin exerts <10% of
the cardiovascular toxicity of cemadotin (7). Because of its
promising antineoplastic activity and reduced toxicity, tasidotin
was recently evaluated in phase I clinical trials and is currently
undergoing phase II trials for the treatment of cancer (7, 8, 10).
Both dolastatin-15 and cemadotin bind to tubulin with moderate
affinity and inhibit microtubule polymerization both in vitro and in
cultured tumor cells (2, 11, 12). Cemadotin also suppresses
microtubule dynamic instability in vitro (11). Microtubules display
two unusual dynamic behaviors that are critical for proper spindle
function during mitosis, dynamic instability, and treadmilling
(13–17). Cells with impaired spindle microtubule dynamics induced by very low concentrations of antimitotic drugs, such as the
Vinca alkaloids or taxol, display misaligned chromosomes with
abnormal spindles and are either completely arrested at mitosis or
exhibit slow progression through mitosis (14, 15). Suppression of
spindle microtubule dynamics with minimal effect on the microtubule mass is thought to be a principal mechanism by which many
microtubule-targeted drugs, acting through different molecular
interactions with tubulin and microtubules, inhibit cell cycle
progression at mitosis and kill tumor cells (14–16).
Only limited data have been published on the ability of tasidotin
to inhibit microtubule polymerization (18, 19), and the effects of

tasidotin on microtubule dynamics have not yet been studied. Here,
we examined the ability of tasidotin to inhibit proliferation and
mitotic spindle organization in MCF7/GFP breast tumor cells in
relation to its ability to alter microtubule polymerization and
dynamic instability. The actions of the major metabolite of
tasidotin, tasidotin C-carboxylate (also called N-desbenzylaminocemadotin; refs. 20, 21), was also examined. We found that at its
IC50 for inhibition of proliferation, tasidotin inhibited mitosis
without appreciably depolymerizing or disorganizing the spindle
microtubules. In addition, tasidotin only weakly inhibited tubulin
polymerization into microtubules in vitro, but it strongly suppressed dynamic instability at microtubule plus ends and less
strongly enhanced it at minus ends. Interestingly, tasidotin Ccarboxylate altered microtubule dynamic instability in a manner
qualitatively similar to that of tasidotin but was >10 times more
potent. Thus, tasidotin may be a relatively weak prodrug, and its
metabolite, tasidotin C-carboxylate, may be the more active
intracellular form of the compound.

Materials and Methods
Purification of microtubule protein and tubulin. Bovine brain
microtubule protein consisting of f70% tubulin and 30% microtubuleassociated proteins (MAPs) was purified and stored as described previously
(22). MAP-free tubulin (>99% tubulin) was purified from the microtubule
protein by phosphocellulose column chromatography (23). Microtubule
protein was polymerized at 37jC in PMME buffer [86 mmol/L PIPES,
36 mmol/L Mes, 1.4 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EGTA, and 1 mmol/L GTP
(pH 6.8; ref. 24)] in the absence or presence of tasidotin or tasidotin
C-carboxylate. MAP-depleted tubulin was polymerized in PMME buffer by
nucleation with f2- to 3-Am-long sea urchin axonemal microtubule seeds
prepared in 10% DMSO and 10% glycerol (24). The final volume of seed
suspension to tubulin solution was 1:50, which reduced the glycerol and
DMSO concentrations in the final suspension to 0.2% each. Polymerization
was monitored turbidimetrically at 350 nm at 37jC.
Analysis of dynamic instability. The dynamic instability behavior of
individual microtubules was carried out by video microscopy as described
previously (11, 22, 25). Briefly, tubulin (20 Amol/L) was mixed with sea urchin
axonemal seeds and polymerized to steady state (40 min, 37jC) in PMME
buffer in the presence or absence of tasidotin or its metabolite. Dynamics
were then measured for a maximum of 60 min. Plus ends were distinguished
from minus ends as described previously (25). The catastrophe frequency

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

(the switching frequency from the growing or attenuated states to
shortening) and the rescue frequency (switching frequency from shortening
to the growing or attenuated state) were determined as described previously
(25). Between 30 and 40 microtubules were analyzed for each condition.
Cell culture. An MCF7 cell line stably transfected with green
fluorescent protein (GFP)/a-tubulin (MCF7/GFP cells), which exhibit good
sensitivity to microtubule targeted antimitotic drugs (e.g., see refs. 24, 26),
were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta
Biological, Atlanta, GA), MEM nonessential amino acid solution (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO; M7145), and Pen/Strep (Sigma; P0781) in a humidified
incubator (37jC, 5% CO2; refs. 21, 23). Doubling time was 29 h.
Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. MCF7/GFP cells were
prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy by a formalin/methanol
fixation as previously described (24, 26). Fixed cells were treated with a
mouse monoclonal antibody cocktail of anti-a-tubulin and anti-h-tubulin
(DM1A /DM1B; 1:1,000; Sigma) followed by addition of FITC-conjugated
secondary antibody (Sigma). Cells were visualized with a Nikon Eclipse E800
fluorescence microscope, and images were acquired using a Photometrics
CoolSNAP HQ digital camera (Tucson, AZ). Microtubule mean lengths and
number concentrations were determined by negative-stain electron
microscopy (27).
Cell proliferation and mitotic arrest. MCF7/GFP cells were seeded at
3  104 per mL (2 mL per well) in six-well Costar culture dishes (Fisher
Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). After 24 h, control wells were harvested for
counting, and fresh medium plus/minus tasidotin (0, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200,
and 300 nmol/L) was added to duplicate wells and incubated for an
additional 20 to 24 h. Tasidotin was diluted from a 100 Amol/L stock
solution in water. Media with detached cells were collected. Attached
cells were collected by rinsing twice with 1 mL Versene (137 mmol/L NaCl,
2.7 mmol/L KCl, 1.5 mmol/L KH2PO4, 8.1 mmol/L Na2PO4, and 0.5 mmol/L
EDTA), 1 mL trypsin, 1 mL trypsin-neutralizing solution, and 1 mL PBS.
All solutions containing adherent and floating cells were pooled, centrifuged, resuspended in 100 AL PBS, and counted using a hemacytometer.
Inhibition of proliferation was calculated by dividing the increase in cell
number in the presence of tasidotin over 24 h by the increase in cell number
in controls. The stated IC50 is the average of the IC50s determined by linear
extrapolation for each of three experiments.
To determine mitotic indices (26), MCF7/GFP cells were plated,
incubated with tasidotin for 20 to 24 h, and collected as described above.
Cells were fixed with 10% formalin in PBS (20 min) followed by 10%
methanol (10 min) and stained with 4¶,6-diamidino-phenylindole (Sigma) to
visualize the DNA. Cells were scored as being either in interphase or in
mitosis. Results are the mean F SD of three independent experiments in
which 300 cells were counted for each drug concentration.

Mechanism of Action of Tasidotin

Results
Effects of tasidotin and tasidotin C-carboxylate on microtubule nucleation and the final extent of polymerization. A
major goal of this work was to determine how tasidotin and its
major metabolite modulate the dynamic instability behavior of
individual microtubules at their opposite ends. We wanted to use
conditions in which the soluble tubulin and polymer mass were
held constant, and we required optimal numbers and lengths of
microtubules to measure their growing and shortening dynamics
(25). Based upon the initial report indicating that 25 to 40 Amol/L
tasidotin suppressed nucleation but did not appreciably affect the
final extent of polymerization (19), we first determined the effects
of tasidotin and its metabolite on the polymerization of selfnucleating MAP-rich microtubules in vitro. As previously reported
(19), concentrations of tasidotin of 5 and 10 Amol/L delayed
formation of microtubules for 10 to 20 min but did not reduce the
eventual polymer mass (Fig. 2A). If the polymerization delay were
due to suppression of nucleation, the mean lengths of the microtubules would be expected to be longer than controls, and the
number of microtubules would be reduced. As expected, 5 Amol/L
tasidotin increased the mean length from 15.8 F 0.3 Am (controls)
to 37.5 F 1.1 Am, and 10 Amol/L tasidotin increased it to 49.2 F
1.7 Am (Fig. 2B). Tasidotin also decreased the microtubule number
concentration from 5.2  1010 per mL (controls) to 2.1  1010
and 1.2  1010 per mL at 5 and 10 Amol/L tasidotin, respectively
(data not shown). Thus, tasidotin suppresses nucleation of MAPrich microtubules. There were no appreciable differences in the
MAP content of the microtubules polymerized in the absence and
presence of tasidotin as determined by SDS-PAGE (data not
shown). Thus, suppression of nucleation by tasidotin does not
seem to be due to depletion of the MAPs.
As a result of suppression of nucleation, the effects of tasidotin
on the final extent of polymerization were difficult to assess in the
foregoing experiments. To determine the ability of tasidotin to
reduce the polymer mass independent of its ability to suppress
nucleation, we bypassed the nucleation reaction by initiating
polymerization of pure tubulin with nucleating seeds (Materials
and Methods). As shown in Fig. 2C, tasidotin did inhibit polymerization, but it did so weakly. Specifically, 10 Amol/L tasidotin
reduced the final extent of polymerization by only f10%. Substantial (45%) inhibition of polymerization required tasidotin
concentrations of 25 Amol/L and higher (Fig. 2C).
Tasidotin C-carboxylate also inhibited polymerization of MAPrich microtubules (Fig. 3A), but in contrast to tasidotin, it did not
inhibit nucleation of the microtubules as determined by analysis
of the lengths of the microtubules formed in the presence of the
compound. Rather than increasing the mean lengths as would
be expected if the metabolite suppressed nucleation, the mean
lengths of the microtubules decreased. For example, 0.5 Amol/L
metabolite, which inhibited polymerization by f10%, reduced the
mean length of the microtubules f20% from 12.9 to 10.5 Am (data
not shown).
In addition, tasidotin C-carboxylate inhibited polymerization
much more strongly than tasidotin. Specifically, 5 Amol/L tasidotin
did not detectably inhibit the final extent of polymerization
of MAP-rich tubulin (Fig. 2A), whereas the same concentration
of tasidotin C-carboxylate inhibited polymerization by f60%
(Fig. 3A). Furthermore, only 2 Amol/L metabolite was required
to inhibit the assembly of MAP-free seeded microtubules by 60%
to 70% (Fig. 3B). Half-maximal inhibition of seeded polymerization by tasidotin required >25 Amol/L compound but required only

www.aacrjournals.org

f1 to 2 Amol/L metabolite (compare Fig. 2C and Fig. 3B). The
potencies of tasidotin and tasidotin C-carboxylate on the
polymerization of MAP-free microtubules are shown together in
Fig. 3C. It is clear that tasidotin C-carboxylate inhibits polymerization f20 to 40 times more strongly than the parent compound.
Tasidotin and its major metabolite strongly suppress
dynamic instability at microtubule plus ends and moderately
enhance dynamic instability at minus ends. We analyzed the
effects of tasidotin and tasidotin C-carboxylate on the growing and
shortening dynamics of individual microtubules at polymer mass
steady state at plus and minus ends (Materials and Methods)
by using compound concentrations and conditions in which
the polymer mass was unaffected or only minimally reduced. The
quantitative effects of tasidotin and its major metabolite on the
plus-end dynamic instability variables are shown in Table 1A and B,
respectively, and in Fig. 4A and B. Quite surprisingly, 5 Amol/L
tasidotin (Table 1A) and tasidotin concentrations as high as 10
Amol/L (data not shown) did not inhibit the growth rate and only
weakly decreased the length the microtubules grew during growth
events. The lack of effect on the growth rate is unusual because all
other microtubule-targeted drugs that can reduce the polymer
mass, including cemadotin (10, 14), also reduce the growth rate. In
contrast with its lack of effect on the growth rate, tasidotin strongly
reduced the rate and extent of shortening (Table 1A; Fig. 4A). At a
concentration of 10 Amol/L, tasidotin suppressed the shortening
rate by 53% ( from 28.4 to 13.3 Am/min; Fig. 4A). Tasidotin also
significantly reduced the catastrophe frequency (Table 1; Fig. 4B).
Tasidotin also strongly decreased the fraction of time the microtubules grew (Fig. 4C, 5) and increased the fraction of time the
microtubules spent in an attenuated (paused) state (Fig. 4C, 4). At
2 Amol/L, tasidotin reduced the overall dynamicity, the total
detectable extent of growth and shortening per unit time by 63%
(Table 1A).
Interestingly, tasidotin C-carboxylate suppressed plus-end dynamics in a manner that was qualitatively similar to, but much
stronger than, the parent compound (Table 1B; Fig. 4A–C). For
example, a concentration of only 0.5 Amol/L tasidotin C-carboxylate
suppressed the shortening rate by 82%, whereas a similar degree
of suppression of this variable required a 10- to 20-fold higher
concentration of tasidotin. The concentration of tubulin used in
the assay was 20 Amol/L, far higher than the concentration of
tasidotin C-carboxylate (0.05–0.5 Amol/L) required to suppress
dynamics, indicating that the metabolite suppresses dynamics
substoichiometrically to tubulin and thus must be acting directly on
the microtubules rather than on the soluble tubulin pool.
We also determined the effects of tasidotin and tasidotin Ccarboxylate on dynamic instability at minus ends. As shown in
Table 1C, tasidotin enhanced dynamic instability at minus ends,
predominantly by increasing the catastrophe frequency and the
percentage of time the microtubules shortened. Tasidotin also
increased the average length the microtubules shortened during
shortening events and decreased the rescue frequency. The
metabolite enhanced dynamic instability at minus ends in a fashion
qualitatively similar to tasidotin but was f10 times more potent
than the parent compound (Table 1C). In addition, the enhancement of dynamic instability at minus ends required considerably
higher concentrations both of tasidotin and tasidotin C-carboxylate
than those required to suppress dynamics at plus ends.
Inhibition of cell proliferation and mitosis in MCF7/GFP

full arrays of kinetochore and interpolar microtubules with few
astral microtubules (Fig. 5B). At approximately one half the IC50
(Fig. 1B; 37 nmol/L) and near the IC50 (Fig. 1B; 76 nmol/L) for
tasidotin, most cells had normal or nearly normal bipolar spindles.
A few of the spindles were abnormal, and some spindles were
somewhat smaller than spindles in control cells. The fraction of
cells with abnormal spindles increased as the tasidotin concentration was increased. In those spindles that remained bipolar, the
chromosomes were loosely organized at the metaphase plate
(Fig. 5B; 300 nmol/L). At tasidotin concentrations higher than the
IC50 (Fig. 1B; 300 and 600 nmol/L tasidotin, respectively), mitotic
cells contained mostly ball-shaped spheres of chromosomes with
a few arrays of microtubules that were mostly disorganized;
however, in a few spindles, most or all of the chromosomes had

congressed to a loosely organized bipolar metaphase plate, with
some chromosomes remaining at the poles and associated with
astral microtubules that sometimes emanated from only one pole.
At f10 times the IC50 (Fig. 1B; 760 nmol/L tasidotin), very few
microtubules remained in the spindles; those spindles that were
bipolar had a few erratically curved thick microtubule fibers and
ball-shaped spheres of chromosomes containing several foci of
short, stubby microtubules. The presence of robust, normal, or
nearly normal bipolar spindles at the IC50 for tasidotin indicates
that the drug does not act primarily by depolymerizing the spindle
microtubules but rather acts by modulating the dynamics of the
spindle microtubules.
The organization of microtubules in tasidotin-treated interphase
cells was also examined. Control interphase cells were well spread

interphase microtubules were still prominent and densely arrayed.
At first glance, microtubules seemed not to have depolymerized
significantly, although such an appearance is probably misleading
because the cells were rounded, smaller in area, and thus thicker.
However, in the regions of the nucleus (particularly visible over the
nucleus), it was clear that many of the microtubules were short and
stubby and often had completely depolymerized into aggregates.
Many cells were multinucleate after incubation with tasidotin
(Fig. 5C; 37, 300, and 600 nmol/L).

Discussion
We have analyzed the mechanism of action of tasidotin
( formerly ILX651), a synthetic microtubule-targeted derivative of
dolastatin-15, and its major metabolite, tasidotin C-carboxylate, on
the polymerization and dynamics of purified microtubules and on
spindle microtubule organization in mitotically blocked MCF/GFP
tumor cells. We find that both tasidotin and tasidotin Ccarboxylate suppress dynamic instability at plus ends of purified
microtubules in vitro at concentrations that are 10 to 20 times
lower than the concentrations that inhibit microtubule polymer-

ization, with the metabolite being considerably more potent than
the parent compound. Tasidotin inhibited proliferation of MCF/
GFP cells by 50% at 63 nmol/L and induced half-maximal
accumulation of cells at mitosis at a similar concentration of
72 nmol/L. These results indicate that the principal antiproliferative mechanism is inhibition of mitotic progression. At the
antimitotic IC50 for tasidotin, blocked spindles seemed normal or
nearly normal (Fig. 5B), indicating that tasidotin was not inhibiting
mitosis by depolymerizing the spindle microtubules but most likely
was acting by modulating their dynamics.
Effects of tasidotin and tasidotin C-carboxylate on dynamic
instability at opposite microtubule ends at steady state in vitro.
Tasidotin strongly stabilized the microtubules at their plus ends. Its
most significant actions were reduction of the rate and length of
shortening, reduction of the fraction of time the microtubules grew,
and reduction of the catastrophe frequency (Table 1A; Fig. 4). The
strong suppressive effects of tasidotin on plus end dynamics (e.g.,
those induced by 5 Amol/L tasidotin) occurred at tasidotin
concentrations that minimally affected the polymer mass either
with MAP-rich microtubules (Fig. 2A) or MAP-free seeded microtubules (Fig. 2C). The inability of tasidotin to inhibit the plus end

most spindles were bipolar with most chromosomes

in the presence of 37 nmol/L tasidotin, some spindles
were abnormal with multiple poles and a spherical
arrangement of chromosomes. With increasing
tasidotin concentration, the percentage of abnormal
multipolar spindles increased, and bipolar spindles
were shorter with loosely congressed chromosomes.

fine filamentous microtubule organization. Cells were
rounded, and their microtubule networks were
depolymerized to increasing degrees after incubation

growth rate is surprising because the related compound cemadotin
as well as compounds thus far studied that are able to depolymerize
microtubules all inhibit the plus-end growth rate (11, 22).
Although the major cellular metabolite of tasidotin, tasidotin
C-carboxylate, suppressed plus end dynamics in a manner that was
qualitatively similar to that of tasidotin, it was much more potent
than tasidotin (Table 1B). For example, 75% suppression of overall

dynamicity required 5 Amol/L tasidotin, but only 0.5 Amol/L
tasidotin C-carboxylate. Like tasidotin, tasidotin C-carboxylate
stabilized the plus ends at concentrations that were much lower
than those required to depolymerize the microtubules.
The minus ends of microtubules in many animal cells are
considered to be nondynamic during interphase (28). However,
during mitosis, whereas the microtubule minus ends remain

Mechanism of Action of Tasidotin

tethered at the spindle poles, they shorten rapidly (29). Tasidotin
and its metabolite enhanced minus-end microtubule dynamics, an
action that could be important in the ability of tasidotin to inhibit
mitosis. The action of tasidotin and its metabolite on opposite
microtubule ends resembles that of vinblastine, which also
stabilizes plus-end dynamics but enhances minus-end dynamics
(23). However, tasidotin and its metabolite act differently on minus
ends from vinblastine. Like vinblastine, tasidotin and tasidotin Ccarboxylate increased the catastrophe frequency and decreased the
rescue frequency. However, tasidotin and its metabolite also
increased the minus-end growth rate and increased the length of
minus end loss during shortening events, which are different from
vinblastine. The abilities of tasidotin and tasidotin C-carboxylate to
enhance minus-end dynamics were f10- to 20-fold weaker than
their abilities to stabilize the plus ends.
How might tasidotin and its metabolite mechanistically
stabilize plus ends and destabilize minus ends? The suppression
of plus end dynamics by tasidotin and tasidotin C-carboxylate
occurred at concentrations well below the concentration of total
tubulin. For example, at a concentration of 0.5 Amol/L tasidotin
and 20 Amol/L tubulin (1:40, tasidotin/tubulin), tasidotin induced
>50% reduction in the dynamicity (Table 1A). Tasidotin Ccarboxylate suppressed plus end dynamics at drug: tubulin ratios
that were even lower than those for tasidotin. Specifically, f0.03 to
0.04 Amol/L tasidotin C-carboxylate reduced the dynamicity
f50%, and at these concentrations, the tubulin concentration
exceeded the tasidotin C-carboxylate concentration by 500-fold.
These data indicate that tasidotin and its metabolite do not
suppress plus end dynamics by acting on soluble tubulin, but
rather, they act directly on the microtubules.
Interestingly, unlike other known antimitotic drugs that inhibit
microtubule polymerization, including cemadotin and vinblastine
(e.g., refs. 11, 16, 23), neither tasidotin nor its metabolite inhibited
the plus-end growth rate. The results suggest that tasidotin and its
metabolite may not act by binding at the plus ends but rather by
binding along the length of the microtubules. In this way, the
actions of tasidotin and its metabolite on dynamics resemble the
action of taxol, which at low concentrations stabilizes microtubule
plus ends but increases the catastrophe frequency at minus ends by
binding at very low stoichiometry to tubulin along the microtubule
surface (30, 31).
Recent studies have indicated that dolastatin-15 binds in the
vicinity of the Vinca binding domain of tubulin (12). Based upon the
available X-ray crystal structure (32), the Vinca binding domain
seems to be in h-tubulin at the inter-dimer interface between atubulin and h-tubulin subunits along the lengths of microtubules
(also see ref. 33). The major contacts of vinblastine are with residues
177, 179, 210, and 214 in h-tubulin. It is reasonable to think that
tasidotin, which is an analogue of dolastatin-15, could also bind in
the vicinity of this domain and thus might be capable of binding to
this site along the entire microtubule surface. If so, stabilization at
the plus ends of microtubules could be due to an ability of tasidotin
to strengthen the intra-protofilament interactions within the
microtubule lattice as it seems to occur with vinblastine.

With purified microtubules, destabilization at the minus ends by
tasidotin, and its metabolite required 10- to 20-fold higher
concentrations than those required to stabilize plus ends, which
indicates that the consequences of tasidotin binding to microtubule surfaces are different at opposite ends. This is reasonable
because tasidotin most likely binds to the h-subunits of tubulin,
which are oriented outward at the plus ends and inward at the
minus ends. Tubulin subunits within the core of the microtubule
lattice are believed to be in a strained conformation (34, 35). It is
conceivable that tasidotin binding to the h-tubulin subunits at the
minus ends, in contrast to the plus ends, may exaggerate such
strain and thus weaken the lateral interactions between the
protofilaments.
Effects of tasidotin on MCF7/GFP cell proliferation and
mitosis. Tasidotin inhibited proliferation of MCF7/GFP cells with
an IC50 of 63 nmol/L (Fig. 5A). It arrested the cells in mitosis
at a similar concentration (IC50, 72 nmol/L). This indicates that
mitotic inhibition is the primary mechanism by which tasidotin
inhibits cell proliferation. Tasidotin induced aberrant organization of the spindle microtubules but did not depolymerize them.
At the mitotic IC50 for tasidotin, the major fraction of microtubules
in interphase cells seemed normal. These results are consistent
with our in vitro data showing that tasidotin and its metabolite
suppress microtubule dynamics at concentrations well below those
required to depolymerize the microtubules and indicate that
tasidotin blocks mitosis by modulating spindle microtubule
dynamics.
Functional significance of tasidotin C-carboxylate. Despite
the high potency of tasidotin C-carboxylate in modulating
microtubule polymerization and dynamics in vitro, its IC50 for
inhibition of cell proliferation is very weak, f4 mmol/L (data not
shown; i.e., 50 times weaker than the parent compound). Thus, it is
reasonable to think that the metabolite must penetrate into cells
very poorly. Recent studies have indicated that in various tumor
cells, tasidotin is transformed into tasidotin C-carboxylate by the
cytosolic endopeptidase prolyloligopeptidase (36, 37). Thus,
tasidotin may be considered to be a relatively weak prodrug that
when administered to cancer cells containing high expression
levels of prolyloligopeptidase (38) is readily transformed into
tasidotin C-carboxylate. Interestingly, tasidotin C-carboxylate is
also formed by metabolism of cemadotin (20, 21). Cemadotin was
found too toxic for use in cancer treatment because of its
cardiovascular effects (5). It is significant that such toxicities do not
occur with tasidotin (7), but the reasons for the improved toxicity
profile are not yet understood. Thus, tasidotin seems to be a
considerably more acceptable drug than cemadotin.
