Abstract
Cell-intrinsic effects such as induction of apoptosis and/or inhibition of cell proliferation have been proposed
as the major antitumor responses to histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). These compounds can also
mediate immune-modulatory effects that may contribute to their anticancer effects. However, HDACi can also
induce anti-inﬂammatory, and potentially immunosuppressive, outcomes. We therefore sought to clarify the role
of the immune system in mediating the efﬁcacy of HDACi in a physiologic setting, using preclinical, syngeneic
murine models of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. We showed an intact immune system was required
for the robust anticancer effects of the HDACi vorinostat and panobinostat against a colon adenocarcinoma and
two aggressive models of leukemia/lymphoma. Importantly, although HDACi-treated immunocompromised
mice bearing established lymphoma succumbed to disease signiﬁcantly earlier than tumor bearing, HDACitreated wild-type (WT) mice, treatment with the conventional chemotherapeutic etoposide equivalently
enhanced the survival of both strains. IFN-g and tumor cell signaling through IFN-gR were particularly important
for the anticancer effects of HDACi, and vorinostat and IFN-g acted in concert to enhance the immunogenicity
of tumor cells. Furthermore, we show that a combination of vorinostat with a-galactosylceramide (a-GalCer),
an IFN-g–inducing agent, was signiﬁcantly more potent against established lymphoma than vorinostat treatment alone. Intriguingly, B cells, but not natural killer cells or CD8þ T cells, were implicated as effectors of
the vorinostat antitumor immune response. Together, our data suggest HDACi are immunostimulatory during
cancer treatment and that combinatorial therapeutic regimes with immunotherapies should be considered in
the clinic. Cancer Res; 73(24); 7265–76. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are U.S. Food and
Drug Administration–approved agents used for the treatment
of hematologic malignancies (1, 2). HDACi can induce a range
of tumor cell-intrinsic biologic responses such as induction of
apoptosis, senescence, differentiation, or inhibition of cell-cycle
progression that could account for their antitumor activities.
Indeed, using preclinical models, we, and others, have previously demonstrated that induction of tumor cell apoptosis is

obligate for HDACi to reduce tumor burden in vivo and enhance
the survival of tumor-bearing mice (3, 4). In addition to direct
effects on tumor cell growth and survival, the therapeutic
effects of HDACi may also involve effects on the host immune
and vascular systems (5). For example, treatment of tumor cells
with HDACi can enhance expression of putative tumor antigens
(6), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II
molecules and associated machinery (7, 8), costimulatory
molecules (9) and natural killer (NK) cell-activating ligands
(10, 11), and enhance phagocytosis by dendritic cells (DC; ref.
12). This could augment the immunogenicity and antigen
presenting capacity of tumor cells and increase their susceptibility to killing by cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL). Indeed,
HDACi have been shown to greatly enhance the sensitivity of
tumors to immunotherapy. This combinatorial approach has
proven highly successful against a range of malignancies in vivo
suggesting HDACi may also engage and mediate an antitumor
immune response during cancer-related therapy (12–14).
Paradoxically, it is possible that HDACi treatment may also
diminish the function of antitumor immune effector cells.
There is evidence to suggest the cytolytic functions of NK cells
are repressed in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
treated with vorinostat (15) and Schmudde and colleagues (16)
demonstrated the activation of na€ve lymphocytes by tumor
antigens, but not the effector functions of activated lymphocytes, was abrogated by HDACi. HDACi are also thought

to have anti-inﬂammatory properties and can reduce the
bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced production of
proinﬂammatory cytokines by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in mice (17). In addition to their direct antiinﬂammatory actions, HDACi can moderate immune function
via induction of Foxp3þ Tregs (regulatory T cells; refs. 14, 18)
and suppression of CD4þ T-cell responses to T-cell receptor
activation (19). Furthermore, preclinical and clinical trials
have been initiated using HDACi to treat autoimmune and
inﬂammatory conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (20, 21) and colitis (18).
Thus, the effects of HDACi on the function of the immune
system seem to be diverse and context-dependent. However,
very few of these studies have demonstrated the importance of
immune modulation in dictating the antitumor effects and
therapeutic outcome of HDACi as a monotherapy in a physiologic setting. To address this, we used preclinical, syngeneic
mouse models of cancer to show that the immune system was
required for the comprehensive antitumor effects of vorinostat
and panobinostat. Striking roles for IFN-g and tumor cell–
restricted IFN-gR signaling were observed in vivo, and vorinostat and IFN-g acted in concert to enhance the immunogenicity
of tumor cells. Treatment of lymphoma with vorinostat in
combination with the IFN-g–inducing agent (a-galactosylceramide, a-GalCer) was signiﬁcantly more efﬁcacious than
vorinostat alone, exemplifying the important role for IFN-g.
Finally, an intriguing role for B cells, but not CD8þ T cells or NK
cells, was also demonstrated, highlighting a novel mechanism
of immune engagement by HDACi during the treatment of
cancer.

Materials and Methods
In vivo tumor models
Mice (6–12 weeks of age) were housed under speciﬁc
pathogen-free conditions with food and water freely available according to the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Animal Experimental Ethics Committee Guidelines. Wild-type
C57Bl/6 (WT) and mMT/.C57Bl/6 (mMT/) mice were
purchased from The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of
Medical Research and Rag-2/ c-g-chain/.C57Bl/6
(Rag-2gc/), IFN-g /.C57Bl/6 (IFN-g /), and IFN-gR/.
C57Bl/6 (IFN-gR/) mice were bred in-house at the Peter
MacCallum Cancer Centre (East Melbourne, Australia). The
C57Bl/6-derived MC38 colon adenocarcinoma line (kindly
provided by Jeff Schlom, NIH, Bethesda, MD) was maintained
as described previously (12). The C57Bl/6-derived Em-myc
leukemia/lymphoma 4242 and 299 lines (derived in-house at
Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre) were maintained as
described previously (3). MC38 cells (1  106) were injected
subcutaneously into the right ﬂank of C57Bl/6 mice. Therapy
was initiated when tumor sized reached 9 mm2 (4 days
after inoculation) and tumor growth was measured every 2 to
3 days. Em-myc 4242 MSCV–IRES–GFP, 299 MSCV–IRES–
GFP and 4242 MSCV–IRES–GFP/mgrDIC (dnIFN-gR) cells
(1  104–5  105) were injected i.v. into the tail vein of WT,
Rag-2gc/, IFN-g /, IFN-gR/, and mMT/ mice. Therapy was initiated when more than 1% GFPþ cells were
detected in the peripheral blood (7–14 days after inocula-

tion), and mice were culled when encumbered by disease.
Mice were treated with vorinostat (with or without a-GalCer), panobinostat, etoposide, or anti-IFN-g mAb (H-22
clone) as indicated.
In situ apoptosis assay and histologic assessment
MC38 tumors from WT and Rag-2gc/ mice resected 4
to 24 hours after treatment with vorinostat or vehicle, or
spleens from vorinostat- and vehicle control–treated WT and
Rag-2gc/ mice bearing established Em-myc lymphoma
resected at endpoint were ﬁxed in 4% buffered formalin
and parafﬁn embedded, and sections were cut. MC38 tumor
sections were interrogated for in situ apoptosis detected
using the Apoptag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection
Kit (Chemicon International; as per the manufacturer's instructions) and quantiﬁed with MetaMorph Microscopy Automation and Image Analysis Software (Molecular Devices).
Splenic sections were examined for tumor burden by hematoxylin and eosin staining.
Flow cytometry for tumor burden and intracellular
IFN-g
Tumor burden was assessed in peripheral blood and/or
spleen of Em-myc lymphoma–bearing WT and Rag-2gc/
mice by gating on live, GFPþB220þ cells, and compared with
B220þCD19þ B cells (anti-B220 RA3-6B2, anti-CD19 1D3; both
eBiosciences). Intracellular staining for IFN-g (XMG1.2; eBiosciences) was performed on peripheral blood following surface
staining for B-cell markers, using the BD Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm Kit
(BD Biosciences) and compared with isotype control (Rat IgG1
and eBRG1; eBiosciences). After staining, cells were washed
twice and resuspended in PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum
and Fluoro-Gold (Fluorochrome, LLC), and acquired by ﬂow
cytometry.
Analysis of cellular signaling pathways by Western blot
analysis
Western blotting was carried out on protein lysates prepared from Em-myc lymphoma cells (1  106) cultured in the
presence of 0.5 mmol/L vorinostat and/or 100 U/mL IFN-g
(Merck Millipore) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control in
complete media for 1 to 6 hours, or MC38 tumors removed
from WT and Rag-2gc/ mice resected 4 hours after treatment with vorinostat or vehicle, following standard Western
blotting techniques. Speciﬁc proteins were detected on the
membrane using anti-mouse STAT1, pSTAT1, AcH4K5, and
AcH3 polyclonal antibodies (Upstate Signaling Solutions) then
reprobed for anti-mouse b-actin (AC-74; Sigma) as a loading
control.
Quantitative PCR for IFN-g expression
Na€ve B cells were isolated from the spleen of WT mice using
CD45R (B220) MicroBeads (Miltenyi) and cultured in complete
media with 100 U/mL IFN-g, 2 ng/mL interleukin (IL)-12, 20
ng/mL IL-18, and 25 mg/mL LPS in the presence of 0.5 mmol/L
vorinostat or DMSO vehicle for 72 hours. Total RNA was
isolated from cell pellets by TRizol extraction (Invitrogen),
300 ng RNA was reversed transcribed with M-MLV RT

cDNA using Brilliant II SYBR Green (Agilent Technologies)
with primers speciﬁc to mouse IFN-g (F: 50 -GCAACAGCAAGGCGAAAAAG-30 , R: 50 -AGCTCATTGAATGCTTGGCG30 ) and L32 (F: 50 -TTCCTGGTCCACAATGTCAAG-30 , R: 50 TGTGAGCGATCTCAGCAC-30 ).
IFN-g detection
Serum was extracted from mouse blood samples and interrogated for IFN-g using the BD Cytometric Cytokine Bead
Array mouse IFN-g Flex Set and Cell Signaling Master Buffer
Set (BD Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions.
Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed using Prism software
(GraphPad Software) and calculated by the Mann–Whitney
test (nonparametric data) or a log-rank sum test (for overall
survival), and a P value of more than 0.05 was always considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
An intact immune system is required for the robust
anticancer activities of vorinostat against a colon
carcinoma
We previously demonstrated that vorinostat treatment of
MC38 colon adenocarcinoma cells signiﬁcantly enhanced
phagocytosis by DCs (12). To further determine whether
vorinostat enhanced the immunogenicity of MC38 tumor
cells, we assessed markers of immunogenic cell death (22)
following exposure to vorinostat. Indeed, calreticulin was
translocated to the surface of vorinostat-treated MC38
cells (as previously demonstrated on brain tumor cells by
Sonneman et al.; ref 23) and HMGB1 and ATP were released
concurrently with the induction of apoptosis, but not in
cells overexpressing the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1D). Given this observation, we next
investigated whether the immune system played a role in
mediating the anticancer effects of vorinostat in vivo. WT
and Rag-2gc/ mice (lacking all lymphocytes; ref. 24) bearing established MC38 tumors were treated with vorinostat
and tumor growth was monitored. As expected, vorinostat
treatment signiﬁcantly delayed tumor growth in WT mice
(Fig. 1A). Strikingly, the antitumor effect of vorinostat was
lost in Rag-2gc/ mice (Fig. 1A). This was not due to a
failure of vorinostat to inhibit HDACs in the immunodeﬁcient mice despite faster growth of MC38 tumors (Fig. 1B).
Lysine 5 on histone 4 (H4K5) was hyperacetylated in vorinostat-treated MC38 tumors extracted from both WT and Rag2gc/ mice in comparison with the relevant control-treated
tumors from each genotype, also conﬁrming appropriate
penetration of HDACi into the tumor mass in both immunecompromised and -competent mice (Fig. 1B). Similarly,
TUNEL staining revealed tumor cell apoptosis in tumors
from both vorinostat-treated WT and Rag-2gc/ mice (Fig.
1C and D). These data suggest an intact immune system is
required to mediate the long-term, complete anticancer
effects of vorinostat against solid malignancies.

An intact immune system is required for the sustained
anticancer effects of vorinostat against an aggressive
lymphoma
Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that HDACi
are highly efﬁcacious against primary B-cell lymphomas arising
from Em-myc transgenic mice (3, 4, 25). Therefore, we used
the Em-myc model to conﬁrm the observation that HDACi required an intact immune system for sustained therapeutic
efﬁcacy. As expected, the treatment of WT mice bearing established Em-myc tumors with vorinostat signiﬁcantly enhanced
survival compared with control treatment (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S1). Although vorinostat also signiﬁcantly enhanced the survival of Rag-2gc/ mice transplanted with
the same Em-myc tumor used in WT mice, vorinostat-treated,
tumor-bearing Rag-2gc/ mice succumbed to lymphoma signiﬁcantly earlier than vorinostat-treated, tumor-bearing WT
mice (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S1). Consistent with
results using the MC38 solid tumor line (Fig. 1B and C), the
acute, direct antitumor activity of vorinostat was not diminished
in Rag-2gc/ mice as the percentage of GFPþ tumor cells was
signiﬁcantly reduced in the spleen of both WT and Rag-2gc/
mice after 5 days treatment (Fig. 2B). At the time of sacriﬁce,
however, the spleen weight of control- and vorinostat-treated
Rag-2gc/ mice was equivalent, suggesting vorinostat could
not sustainably reduce tumor expansion as was observed in WT
mice (Fig. 2C). Histologic assessment conﬁrmed this ﬁnding, as
vorinostat treatment reduced tumor burden and restored normal splenic architecture in WT mice, but not in Rag-2gc/
mice (Fig. 2D). Rag-2gc/ mice did not suffer from overt drug
toxicity as no signiﬁcant weight loss was recorded over the
treatment period for either strain of mouse (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Em-myc cells did not develop resistance to vorinostat
throughout the course of treatment as cells harvested from
vorinostat-treated WT and Rag-2gc/ mice at sacriﬁce remained sensitive to vorinostat-induced apoptosis upon re-treatment ex vivo (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Together, these data
suggest Rag-2gc/ mice succumbed to lymphoma despite
vorinostat treatment due to lack of a functional immune system.
Anticancer activities of HDACi, but not etoposide, are
mediated by the immune system
We extended our discovery that sustained anticancer effects
of vorinostat required an intact host immune system by using a
second, genetically distinct Em-myc lymphoma and a second
HDACi, panobinostat. Consistent with Fig. 2A, vorinostat did
prolong the survival of Rag-2gc/ mice bearing a genetically
different Em-myc lymphoma compared with the control-treated group (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S1). However,
tumor-bearing Rag-2gc/ mice again succumbed to disease
signiﬁcantly earlier than tumor-bearing WT mice despite vorinostat treatment (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S1). Also,
in agreement with our previous publication (4), WT
mice bearing established Em-myc lymphoma responded successfully to panobinostat and survival was signiﬁcantly
enhanced compared with control treatment (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table S1). Similarly, Rag-2gc/ mice bearing
established Em-myc lymphoma treated with panobinostat survived signiﬁcantly longer than control-treated Rag-2gc/

against different primary Em-myc lymphomas and a genetically

bearing established Em-myc lymphoma was signiﬁcantly
enhanced by treatment with vorinostat compared with control
treatment, tumor-bearing, vorinostat-treated IFN-g / mice

Functional tumor cell IFN-gR signaling is required for
robust anticancer effects of HDACi
We next aimed to conﬁrm the role of IFN-g and IFN-gR
tumor cell signaling in tumor-bearing immunocompetent
mice during vorinostat treatment. A dominant-negative form
of the IFN-gR (dnIFN-gR) with a mutated intracellular signaling domain that inhibits signal transduction through the WT
receptor (27) was expressed in Em-myc cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4A). Signaling downstream of the IFN-gR was completely
suppressed in dnIFN-gR–expressing Em-myc cells, as STAT1
was not phosphorylated in response to IFN-g treatment,
despite equivalent expression of STAT1 compared with empty
vector–expressing Em-myc cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Vorinostat induced hyperacetylation of histone H3 in both
cell types (Supplementary Fig. S4B). IFN-g has been shown to
both inhibit (28) and enhance (29) proliferation of tumor cells,
and has been shown to induce tumor cell apoptosis (30).
However, treatment of Em-myc cells with IFN-g in vitro did
not inhibit proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S4C), nor induce
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S4D) regardless of addition of

mice (Fig. 5C). Investigation into the IFN-g signaling pathway of
Em-myc cells revealed that not only is STAT1 robustly phosphorylated upon treatment with IFN-g (as expected given the
high expression of IFN-gR; Supplementary Fig. S4B), but that
vorinostat sensitized tumor cells to IFN-g leading to higher
levels of phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1; Fig. 5D). The activity
of vorinostat, as conﬁrmed by hyperacetylation of histone H3,
did not alter induction of pSTAT1 by IFN-g or expression of
STAT1, thus conﬁrming that, in Em-myc cells at least, IFN-g
signaling occurs independently of HDAC activity. Together,
these data suggest that IFN-g is required for the prolonged

vorinostat. Similarly, expression of the dnIFN-g did not alter
proliferation of Em-myc cells (Supplementary Fig. S4E), nor
inﬂuence sensitivity to vorinostat (Supplementary Fig. S4F).
IFN-g may also enhance tumor cell immunogenicity (31, 32).
Indeed, treatment of Em-myc cells with IFN-g and vorinostat
enhanced the expression of MHC class I and II above levels
induced by each agent alone in a manner dependent on
functional IFN-gR signaling (Supplementary Fig. S5). The
importance of tumor cell–restricted IFN-gR signaling for sustained in vivo responses to vorinostat was investigated. Treatment of mice bearing dnIFN-gR Em-myc lymphoma with
vorinostat signiﬁcantly enhanced survival compared with control treatment; however, vorinostat-treated mice bearing
dnIFN-gR Em-myc lymphoma succumbed to lymphoma signiﬁcantly earlier than vorinostat-treated mice bearing empty
vector Em-myc lymphoma (Fig. 5E). These data demonstrate
that tumor cell signaling through the IFN-gR is necessary for
vorinostat to mediate a robust antitumor response in vivo.
Combination of vorinostat and IFN-g–inducing
immunotherapy is highly efﬁcacious in the treatment of
established lymphoma
We rationalized that a combination of vorinostat with an
inducer of IFN-g may provide greater therapeutic effects than
single-agent treatment. We therefore used a-GalCer, an agent
that is currently under clinical investigation as an anticancer
immunotherapy and vaccine adjuvant (33). a-GalCer treatment of WT mice bearing established Em-myc lymphoma
signiﬁcantly enhanced serum IFN-g levels compared with
control treatment, regardless of vorinostat (Fig. 6A). After 14
days of therapy, tumor growth was arrested in vorinostattreated mice compared with both control- and a-GalCer–
treated mice. However, treatment with the combination of
a-GalCer and vorinostat reduced tumor burden to undetectable levels in the peripheral blood (Fig. 6B). Furthermore,
treatment of tumor-bearing mice with the combination therapy achieved a signiﬁcant survival advantage compared with
vorinostat treatment alone (Fig. 6C). The fact that a-GalCer
alone had no impact on tumor growth or mouse survival, along
with Fig. 5D, suggests that the treatment of established tumors
with HDACi may sensitize tumor cells to the anticancer effects
of IFN-g. Furthermore, these data suggest that the administration of HDACi concurrently with acute induction of IFN-g is
better able to control tumor growth than HDACi alone and is a
viable option for enhancing the therapeutic efﬁcacy of HDACi.
B cells play a role in mediating the antitumor effects of
vorinostat
Given the role of IFN-g during vorinostat treatment and
the enhanced immunogenicity of tumor cells by IFN-g and
vorinostat, we hypothesised CTLs may be a key effector cell
of the antitumor immune response. Thus, WT mice bearing
established Em-myc lymphoma were depleted of speciﬁc
lymphocyte subsets and treated with vorinostat. However,
despite efﬁcient depletion from peripheral blood (Supplementary Fig. S6), survival of mice lacking functional CD8þ T
cells bearing Em-myc lymphoma was equivalent to that of
tumor-bearing CIgG–depleted WT mice following vorinostat

Figure 6. Combination of a-GalCer and vorinostat is signiﬁcantly more potent than vorinostat alone. WT mice bearing established Em-myc 299 B-cell
lymphoma (14 days after inoculation) was treated with vorinostat (as described in Fig. 2A), one dose of 2 mg a-GalCer i.p. on the ﬁrst day of vorinostat
treatment, vorinostat and a-GalCer at the same dose and schedule as for individual agents, or vehicle control-treated. A, serum was probed for IFN-g by a

treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Similarly, vorinostat
sustained survival of tumor-bearing WT mice depleted of NK
cells equivalently to that of CIgG-depleted tumor–bearing
WT mice (Supplementary Fig. S7D). Codepletion of CD8
and CD4þ T cells or CD8þ T cells and NK cells did not
alter survival compared with depletion of individual subsets
(Supplementary Fig. S7C and S7E), together suggesting CTLs
do not play a role in mediating the anticancer effects of
vorinostat. In support, survival of mice lacking perforin
(perforin/) bearing Em-myc lymphoma was equivalent to
that of WT mice following vorinostat treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7F).
Given these results, we investigated the role of another
potential effector lymphocyte, B cells. Interestingly, despite
vorinostat signiﬁcantly enhancing survival of B-cell deﬁcient
mice (mMT/ mice; ref. 34) bearing established Em-myc
tumors compared with control, vorinostat-treated, tumorbearing mMT/ succumbed to lymphoma signiﬁcantly earlier
than vorinostat-treated, tumor-bearing WT mice (Fig. 7A).
These data suggest that B cells may have an important role
in mediating the antitumor effects of vorinostat. Consistent
with this observation, although the tumorigenic Em-myc B
lymphoma cells were depleted upon treatment with vorinostat

7272

Cancer Res; 73(24) December 15, 2013

in vivo, the normal B-cell compartment was not affected (Fig.
7B). Furthermore, stimulation of na€ve murine B cells for 72
hours in vitro with known inducers of IFN-g (35) concurrently
with vorinostat treatment signiﬁcantly enhanced the expression of IFN-g mRNA compared with control-treated, stimulated B cells (Fig. 7C). Na€ve B cells did not produce IFN-g, nor did
vorinostat treated, unstimulated B cells at the same time point
(data not shown), demonstrating the requirement for immune
engagement concomitant with vorinostat treatment for
enhanced IFN-g production. Finally, analysis of B cells from
the peripheral blood of WT mice bearing Em-myc lymphoma
following vorinostat treatment revealed signiﬁcantly higher
levels of intracellular IFN-g compared with mice receiving
control treatment (Fig. 7D), suggesting B cells are active
producers of IFN-g in vivo. Together, these data demonstrate
a striking role for B cells in mediating the vorinostat antitumor
immune response, and suggest these cells may produce IFN-g
in response to vorinostat treatment.

Discussion
It had previously been suggested that HDACi may inhibit
antitumor immunity (15, 16) and that HDACi possess immunosuppressive properties (17, 18, 20, 21). Herein, we have used

sophisticated mouse models and genetic and biologic tools to
conclusively demonstrate that although HDACi have some
early intrinsic and direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells, an
intact immune system is required for vorinostat and panobinostat to induce sustained anticancer responses against solid
and hematologic tumors. These data complement our previous
work demonstrating the combination of HDACi with immunotherapy is highly efﬁcacious against solid malignancies (12),
and the work of others demonstrating the production of IFN-g
by CD8þ T cells in mice following injection with HDACi-treated
tumor cells (9).
Our data provide the ﬁrst demonstration that HDACi elicit
antitumor immunity in vivo. The remarkable capacity of chemotherapeutics to stimulate antitumor immunity has recently
been described. Certain drugs such as doxorubicin, daunarubicin, and gemcitabine can mediate a potent CD8þ T-cell

response by inducing immunogenic cell death (also demonstrated herein following vorinostat treatment), upregulating
tumor antigens, or increasing cross presentation of tumor
antigen, respectively (22, 36, 37). Other drugs, such as etoposide, are considered nonimmunogenic (38), as conﬁrmed
herein. We were unable to identify distinct immune cell subset
that was singularly important for sustained antitumor effects
of HDACi. However, our studies did demonstrate that B cells,
rather than CTLs described in the studies above, play a very
important functional role in mediating potent responses to
vorinostat. A precise role for B cells in mediating tumor
eradication has not been well documented, but there is evidence that effector B cells can be directly cytotoxic to tumor
cells (39, 40), and produce IFN-g and other stimulatory cytokines (41) as well as tumor-speciﬁc antibodies that would
putatively enhance host antitumor responses through

West et al.

antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (39, 40). Our data
suggest the key role of B cells is to produce IFN-g. We observed
a strong induction of MHC class II on Em-myc cells following
IFN-g and vorinostat treatment, which may indicate a role for
CD4þ Th cells in mediating a humoral antitumor response. Any
potential functional interplay between CD4þ T cells and B cells,
as well as the role for additional supporting cells such as NKT
cells, gdT cells, macrophages, and DCs, in our system requires
further assessment.
The importance of host-derived IFN-g in mediating a prolonged therapeutic response to vorinostat has not previously
been reported. Although the induction of IFN-g by chemotherapeutics during anticancer treatment has been demonstrated
previously, (37, 38), the requirement for IFN-g for therapeutic
efﬁcacy has only been demonstrated for doxorubicin (42) and
HDACi as shown herein. The role of IFN-g in protecting the
host from cancer development has long been recognized, and
IFN-g can directly inﬂuence tumor cell immunogenicity (31,
32), proliferation (28, 29), and death (30). It seems that during
the treatment of Em-myc lymphoma, vorinostat, and IFN-g act
in concert to enhance tumor cell immunogenicity, demonstrated by upregulation of MHC expression and an abrogated
vorinostat response in vivo using Em-myc cells defective in
IFN-g signaling. Loss-of-function mutations in the IFN-g signaling pathway are a common mechanism by which tumor
cells "escape" the immune system (32) and Kaplan and colleagues found 25% of human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were
resistant to IFN-g due to mutations in components of the IFN-g
signaling pathway such as JAK1, JAK2, and IFN-gR a chain (31).
As well as genetic tumor "escape" mechanisms, epigenetic
mechanisms are also prevalent (43), particularly in the repression of MHC molecules. Upon stimulation with IFN-g, histone
H3 and H4 at the MHC class II locus are acetylated, leading to
chromatin remodeling and gene expression (44). Expression
of the CII transactivator, essential for MHC class II expression,
is repressed during the development of B cells to plasma cells
by the removal of activating histone acetylation marks and
subsequent chromatin remodeling (45). It seems that tumor
cells may harness these epigenetic modiﬁcations to shutdown
expression of immunogenic molecules and evade antitumor
immunity (46), as the treatment of IFN-g–insensitive tumor
cells with HDACi can enhance expression of MHC class I, II,
and the costimulatory molecule CD40 (7). Indeed, we demonstrate that IFN-g induction alone (by a-GalCer) did not elicit
antitumor activity against Em-myc lymphoma; however, in
combination with vorinostat, survival of tumor-bearing mice
was signiﬁcantly enhanced, suggesting HDACi treatment may
sensitise tumor cells to IFN-g.
There is evidence supporting a biologically important interplay between HDACi and IFN-g. HDACs are closely associated
with the regulation of STAT-independent, IFN-inducible genes
at the transcriptional level (44, 45). Nuclear STAT1 and 2
coprecipitate with HDAC1 and 2 (47) suggesting gene transcription by STAT 1/2 is inﬂuenced by either direct STAT
acetylation or by recruitment of HDACs to STAT DNA binding
sites (47, 48). Moreover, cytoplasmic, inactive STAT1 can be
directly acetylated at lysine residues 410 and/or 413 by HDAC3
(49). The acetylation of STAT1 is thought to act as a "timer,"

7274

Cancer Res; 73(24) December 15, 2013

inhibiting activity of IFN-induced STAT1 by restricting nuclear
translocation, thereby promoting restoration of a resting cellular state (49). However, the regulation of STAT1 activity by
acetylation is currently under debate as Antunes and colleagues were unable to detect acetylation of STAT1 either in a
resting state, or following HDACi or IFN treatment (50). The
phosphorylation of STAT1 also dictates its activity, and we
demonstrated that IFN-g signaling induced phosphorylation of
STAT1 at the tyrosine residue 701 (Tyr701) in Em-myc tumor
cells. Our data also demonstrated phosphorylation of STAT1
not only occurred independently of HDAC activity, but was also
enhanced following vorinostat treatment. The phosphorylation of STAT1 independent of HDAC activity has been as
demonstrated by some (47, 48, 50), however, others suggest
STAT1 cannot be phosphorylated in the presence of HDAC
inhibition due to the concomitant inhibition of the phosphorylation/acetylation "switch" (occurring at Tyr701; refs. 23, 49).
Our study provides direct experimental evidence demonstrating the functional importance of the host immune system
in mediating sustained antitumor responses to HDACI. We
have identiﬁed key immune cells (B cells) and effector molecules (IFN-g) that play important roles in signiﬁcantly augmented HDACi efﬁcacy in preclinical models. Moreover, using
a-GalCer we have identiﬁed a novel combination strategy to
exploit the functional interplay between IFN-g and HDACi that
was well tolerated and therapeutically advantageous.
