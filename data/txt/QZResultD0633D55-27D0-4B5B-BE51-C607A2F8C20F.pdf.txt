ABSTRACT
Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have multiple protective effects
that facilitate repair of damage to tissues and organs. However, while various
stressors are known to impair EPC function, the mechanisms of oxidative stressinduced EPC senescence remains unknown. We demonstrated that B2 receptor
(B2R) expression on circulating CD34+ cells was significantly reduced in patients
with diabetes mellitus (DM) as compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, CD34+
cell B2R expression in patients with DM was inversely correlated with plasma
myeloperoxidase concentrations. Bradykinin (BK) treatment decreased human EPC
(hEPC) senescence and intracellular oxygen radical production, resulting in reduced
retinoblastoma 1 (RB) RNA expression in H2O2-induced senescent hEPCs and a reversal
of the B2R downregulation that is normally observed in senescent cells. Furthermore,
BK treatment of H2O2-exposed cells leads to elevated phosphorylation of RB, AKT,
and cyclin D1 compared with H2O2-treatment alone. Antagonists of B2R, PI3K, and
EGFR signaling pathways and B2R siRNA blocked BK protective effects. In summary,
this study demonstrates that BK significantly inhibits oxidative stress-induced hEPC
senescence though B2R-mediated activation of PI3K and EGFR signaling pathways.

role in cell senescence by suppressing the expression of
genes involved in DNA replication [3]. However, while
oxidative stress can induce cell senescence via the RB
signaling pathway, the mechanism of EPC senescence
induced by oxidative stress remains unknown [4, 5].
The tissue kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) has
essential regulatory functions that can depress blood
pressure and counter oxidative stress that have been
validated in previous research [6]. The peptide bradykinin
(BK) is a potent vasodilator and inflammatory mediator
that can protect endothelial and myocardial cells against
inflammation and ischemia injury via the B2 receptor
(B2R). Previous research from our laboratory has shown
that EPCs promote angiogenesis following myocardial
infarction through the B2R signaling pathway [7].
Recently, other studies have demonstrated that BK
suppresses cell DNA damage in a manner that has the
potential for eliciting anti-senescence effects [8–11].
However, whether or not BK protects EPCs against

INTRODUCTION
Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are adult
stem cells that exist within the vascular circulation and
have numerous protective effects due to their ability
to differentiate into endothelial cells, repair vascular
intima injury, and promote angiogenesis post myocardial
infarction [1]. However, stress-induced premature (SIP)
senescence of EPCs caused by oxidative stress related
to coronary artery disease and diabetes can impair their
function, leading to harmful outcomes. Stress-induced
premature senescence is characterized by DNA damage,
resulting in dysfunction, inhibition of mitosis, senescence,
and even apoptosis. In addition, research has shown that
decreases in the quantity and quality of EPCs can lead to
enhanced progression of diabetes [2].
Numerous studies on the mechanisms of cellular
senescence utilizing tumor cells and immortalized cell
lines have revealed that retinoblastoma 1 (RB) plays a key

BK suppresses H2O2-induced intracellular
oxygen radical production

oxidative stress-induced senescence via the B2R remains
unknown.
This study was designed to confirm the antisenescence effects of BK signaling via the B2R pathway
in EPCs and to investigate the detailed regulatory
mechanism controlling this activity, which has important
implications for the treatment of coronary artery disease
and diabetes.

Examination of intracellular oxygen radicals
visualized using dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA)
probes incubated with H2O2-induced senescent hEPCs
showed that the senescent cells had significantly higher
levels than normal controls (mean fluorescence intensities:
0.143 ± 0.014/pixel vs 0.034 ± 0.001/pixel, p < 0.05).
Also, we found that treatment with BK at 0.1 nM (mean
fluorescence intensities: 0.063 ± 0.002/pixel vs 0.143 ±
0.014/pixel, p < 0.05) and 1.0 nM (mean fluorescence
intensities: 0.060 ± 0.003/pixel vs 0.143 ± 0.014/pixel,
p < 0.05) suppressed the generation of intra-cellular
oxygen radicals compared to hEPCs treated with H2O2
alone. No statistical differences were found between
cells treated with the 2 concentrations of BK (p > 0.05,
Figure 4).

RESULTS
B2R expression on circulating CD34+ cells
from patients with diabetes mellitus (DM)
and healthy controls
No differences in age or gender were found between
the DM and healthy control study groups. However,
the expression of B2R on circulating CD34+ cells from
DM patients was significantly reduced compared to
healthy controls (Figures 1A and 1B; 56.8 ± 12.8% vs
97.8 ± 1.7%; p < 0.001). Furthermore, DM patient plasma
myeloperoxidase (MPO) concentrations were significantly
higher than for controls (Figure 1C; 4.3 ± 1.0 ng/mL vs
2.5 ± 0.6 ng/mL, p < 0.001). Pearson correlation analyses
showed that plasma MPO concentration was inversely
correlated with the B2R expression level on CD34+ cells
(Figure 1D; r = −0.619; p = 0.001).

RB expression in H2O2-induced hEPC senescence
was significantly decreased following BK
treatment
As shown in Figure 5, a PCR array showed that
treatment with 0.1 nM BK changed the expression of
33 senescence-associated genes more than 1.2-fold and
6 genes more than 2-fold (Supplemental Table 1). Notably,
RB gene expression was down-regulated 176.15-fold after
BK treatment.

Characterization of cultured hEPCs

Signaling pathway inhibitors and B2R siRNA
decrease the protective effects of BK

Human umbilical cord blood-derived mononuclear
cells (MNCs) were separated by density-gradient
centrifugation. Double staining for FITC-lectin and
acLDL-Dil showed that human EPCs (hEPCs) were able
to uptake acLDL-Dil, which binds to an endothelial cellspecific lectin. Immunofluorescence showed that these
hEPCs expressed CD34, kinase domain receptor (KDR),
and CD105, but not CD45. hEPCs were immunopositive
for CD34, KDR, CD105, and B2R, but not CD45 by flow
cytometry (Figure 2).

Efficient B2R silencing was confirmed by a
reduction in the B2R protein level as shown by Western
blot (Figure 6A). HOE-140, LY-294002, AG1478,
and B2R siRNA significantly antagonized the antisenescence effects of BK in hEPCs compared with no
inhibitor (40.8  ±  2.3 cells/field, 41.6 ± 3.0 cells/field,
42.4 ± 2.3  cells /field, and 43.8 ± 3.6 cells/field vs
20.4 ± 1.7 cells/field, respectively; p < 0.05; Figure 6B).
Furthermore, incubating hEPCs treated with H2O2 and
0.1 nM BK with HOE-140, LY-294002, AG1478, and
B2R siRNA significantly increased the generation of
intracellular oxygen radicals in hEPCs than those treated
with only H2O2 and 0.1 nM BK (mean fluorescence
intensities: 0.098 ± 0.011/pixel, 0.092 ± 0.003/pixel,
0.093 ± 0.003/pixel, and 0.099 ± 0.002/pixel vs
0.063 ± 0.002/pixel, respectively; p < 0.05; Figure 6C)

BK inhibits oxidative stress-induced senescence
β-galactosidase (SA-Gal) staining revealed that
300 μM H2O2 significantly induced hEPC senescence
(mean ± SEM, 49.6 ± 8.2 cells/field vs 6.4 ± 1.1 cells/
field, p < 0.05). Furthermore both 0.1 nM and 1.0 nM BK
dramatically inhibited H2O2-induced hEPC senescence
compared to cells treated with H2O2 alone (20.4 ±
1.7  cells/field vs 6.4 ± 1.1 cells/field for 0.1 nM BK;
18.0 ± 6.0 cells/field vs 6.4 ± 1.1 cells/field for 1.0 nM
BK; p < 0.05). No statistical difference in oxidative stressinduced senescence was found between 0.1 and 1.0 nM
BK treatment groups (p > 0.05, Figure 3).

that RB expression was significantly reduced in hEPCs
treated with H2O2 plus BK compared with those treated
with H2O2 alone. However, when HOE-140, LY-294002,
AG1478, and B2R siRNA were added to the culture
media to block the signaling pathway, RB expression was
up-regulated compared to those cells treated with H2O2 and
BK alone. These data indicate that the effects of BK were
impaired (Figure 7A). Additionally, the B2R expression
by hEPCs treated with H2O2 was significantly lower than
expression by normal controls, with BK treatment at least
partially reversing this affect. Furthermore, treatment with

shown in Figure 8A, P-Ser473AKT expression was
down-regulated following treatment with 300 μM H2O2
compared to control cells. Furthermore, BK increased
P-Ser473AKT expression in H2O2-treated hEPCs, while
B2R blockade and siRNA knockdown, along with PI3K
antagonist treatment, reduced P-Ser473AKT expression
in H2O2-treated hEPCs compared to treatment with
BK and H2O2 alone. However, the addition of AG1478
had no impact on P-Ser473AKT expression compared
with BK treatment alone. Furthermore, there were no
differences found in total AKT expression between
groups, indicating that these results were due to changes
in protein phosphorylation and not expression. Cyclin
D1 expression was elevated in controls but reduced
dramatically following H2O2-induced senescence. Also,
while BK treatment up-regulated cyclin D1 expression,
treatment with either a B2R antagonist or siRNA along
with PI3K antagonist treatment reduced cyclin D1
and P-Ser473AKT expression compared with BK and
H2O2 treatment alone. Treatment with AG1478 also
reduced cyclin D1 expression. Additionally, we found
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that changes in the expression of P-Ser249 and Thr252RB
paralleled those of cyclin D1 (Figure 8B).

DISCUSSION
This study revealed a significant decrease in the
number of B2R/CD34 double positive cells in patients
with DM. This decrease was inversely correlated with high
plasma levels of MPO and BK, which were protective
against reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cell
senescence through B2R-dependent, AKT/Cyclin D1/
RB and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Cyclin
D1/RB signaling pathways. This research is the first to
demonstrate that oxidative stress impairs the expression
of B2R on EPCs both in vitro and ex vivo, and conversely
that BK suppresses ROS-induced senescence via a B2Rdependent pathway.
Oxidative stress plays a key role in various diseases,
including DM and coronary artery disease (CAD) [12].

characteristic of oxidative stress, which can injure tissues
and organs and promote EPC senescence via activation
of the ROS signaling cascade [13]. As a result, cellular
senescence is thought to be a reflection of systemic
dysfunction caused by oxygen radicals that lead to cell
cycle arrest and a failure to repair cell injury.
B2R is a critical cell surface receptor molecule
that is activated by BK and expressed on numerous cells,
including EPCs that regulate cell proliferation and injury
repair [14]. For example, low B2R expression is associated
with inhibition of cell proliferation [15]. BK binds to
both B1 (B1R) and B2 receptor. B1R is an inducible
receptor that is elevated during inflammation and cell
stress. Previous research has demonstrated that BK elicits
its protective effects through recruitment of circulating
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CD34+ cells [16] and inhibition of H2O2-induced EPC
senescence [17] through the B2R-mediated signaling
pathway. In an aging rat model, the cardioprotective
actions of bradykinin are physiologically mediated via
B2R, whereas B1R is induced by tissue damage, which
suggests that age-related decreases in B2R protein levels
may leave the heart vulnerable to ischemic damage, and
that increased B1R expression and activity may represent
a compensatory reaction in aging hearts [18]. It can be
concluded that BK inhibits H2O2-induced senescence of
endothelial progenitor cells through the B2R signaling
pathway. Furthermore, studies in animal models
revealed that deficiencies in B2R function accelerate
cell senescence and that B2R is strongly associated
with P53 expression, as B2R knockout diabetic mice

are resistant to oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial
injury and show high expression of the tumor suppressor
gene P53 [19]. A previous study showed that coronary
artery disease is associated with down-regulation of B2R
expression by circulating EPCs [20], which is supported
by our research showing that B2R expression is lower on
circulating CD34+ cells from patients with diabetes and
is accompanied by higher degrees of oxidative stress
compared with healthy subjects. These results suggest that
oxidative stress caused by DM impairs B2R expression on
circulating EPCs. Furthermore, we found that oxidative
stress caused by oxygen radicals impairs the expression
of B2R on EPCs and leads to EPC senescence. Therefore,
we hypothesize that B2R is the key element that regulate
oxidative stress-induced EPC senescence.
BK is the endogenous ligand of B2R and has
protective effects that inhibit the senescence of endothelial
cells by suppression of oxidative stress via activation
of B2R [21, 22]. These findings were confirmed by
our research, which demonstrated that BK inhibits the
senescence of hEPCs treated with H2O2 by decreasing
production of oxygen radicals via a B2R-dependent
pathway.
A great number of studies have revealed that BK
activates the PI3K/AKT pathway following binding to
B2R and that it elicits its protective effect in part via the
B2R/PI3K/AKT signal pathway [23]. Specifically, PI3K/
AKT is activated by BK via B2R in cardiomyocyte cells,
which then stimulates the AKT/eNOS pathway to protect
hEPCs from oxidative stress and senescence [24, 25]. In
this study, our results have confirmed that BK inhibition of
oxidative stress and hEPC senescence is at least partly due
to activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway via B2R. However,
our study has also exposed a deeper mechanism involving
the EGFR receptor tyrosine kinase. Several studies have
shown that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) can
transactivate EGFR and mediate several biological effects,
including cell proliferation. Furthermore, BK mediation of
cell proliferation in corneal fibroblasts depends on EGFR
transactivation [26]. Activation of the EGFR signaling
pathway can promote the cell cycle in late G1 [27]. In
addition, EGFR signaling is reported to protect skeletal
myoblasts from oxidative stress [28]. Consequently,
the EGFR signaling pathway has protective effects that
inhibit cell cycle arrest and oxidative stress. In our study,
an EGFR antagonist blocked the protective effects of BK
independent of AKT phosphorylation. This phenomenon
suggests that BK may stimulate EGFR by transactivation
via B2R to regulate in part hEPC senescence. However,
this possibility will require additional experiments in
the future to determine the specific factor that primarily
regulates senescence.
The generation of senescence involves complicated
signaling pathways and a variety of associated molecules
that have been investigated in tumor cells, fibrosis
cells, and immortalized cell lines. Currently, 2 major
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mechanisms, the P53/P21/cyclin/RB and P16/cyclin/
RB signaling pathways, have been shown to contribute
to cell senescence [29–31]. RB is a key molecule
involved in both of these pathways that has the ability
to stimulate cells to enter S phase or to remain in G0/
G1 phase via phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
activities, resulting in either RB release of or binding to
the transcription factor E2F [32–34]. Additionally, DNA
damage and senescence have been found to occur as a
result of RB dephosphorylation in thyroid adenoma C
cells [35], while deletion of RB can impair pancreatic
cancer cell senescence, resulting in the acceleration
of pancreatic cancer progression [36]. In progenitor
cells, down-regulation of phosphorylated RB leads to
doxorubicin -induced cardiac progenitor cell senescence
[37]. Elevated expression of cyclin D1 leads to RB
phosphorylation cell proliferation [38], while downregulation of cyclin D1 and low RB phosphorylation
lead to cell cycle arrest and senescence [39–41]. Oxidative
stress is a promotional factor that leads to senescence.
Cyclin D1 and RB are downstream proteins involved in
the pathway of oxidative stress-induced senescence and
oxidative stress can suppress cyclin D1 expression [42],
but there are no reports that inhibition of cyclin D1 and
RB phosphorylation mediates intracellular levels of
oxygen radicals. However, the current understanding of
the mechanism by which BK mediates anti-senescence
pathways in CD34+ hEPCs is incomplete. In this study,
we demonstrate that BK can increase cyclin D1 expression
and RB phosphorylation and then inhibit hEPC senescence
via 2 signaling pathways. Based on our data and previous
studies, cyclin D1 and RB phosphorylation inhibition may
promote the oxidative stress-induced senescence of CD34+
hEPCs.
Moreover, other studies have reported that the
GPCR/PI3K/AKT pathway can directly regulate cell
cycle-associated proteins [43]. Our research confirmed that
BK promotes expression of cyclin D1 through the B2R/
AKT pathway to inversely control RB via phosphorylation
at Ser 249 and Thr 252. In addition, we found that BK
stimulates EGFR activity via GPCR transactivation,
and then further activates cyclin D1 to promote the RB
phosphorylation. We suspect that oxidative stress inhibits
RB phosphorylation, promoting senescence, while BK
suppresses senescence via the hEPC PI3K/AKT signaling
pathways. However, the signaling molecules involved
in EGFR transactivation by GPCR remain uncertain.
Previous studies have shown that various factors
participate in the progression of transactivation, including
Src [44], ADAM-17 [45], integrin α5β1 [46], and both
collagenase-2 and -3 [47], which activate various signaling
pathways involving different signaling molecules in
different cells, making the identification of one responsible
pathway quite challenging. Despite this study and previous
research, the messenger molecule involved in EGFR
transactivation by GPCR in hEPCs remains unknown.

culture using EGM-2, with spindle-shaped cells observed
after 7 days. Colonies of endothelial-like cells grew
until confluence and then were trypsinized and plated
uniformly in new T-25 culture flasks as a first passage. The
cell culture medium was changed every 3 days, and cells
were passaged at a ratio of 1:2 when the cells reached
80% confluence. Subsequent passages were performed
similarly, and the isolated hEPCs from passages 3 ~ 6
were used in the study.
hEPCs were primarily characterized by phase
contrast microscopy to evaluate cobblestone morphology.

endothelial cells marker lectin, and the cells were
examined under a fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Japan).
Immunofluorescence-based flow cytometry (Abcam,

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Determination of B2R and plasma
myeloperoxidase levels in blood samples from
patients with DM
Blood samples from 13 patients with DM treated at
the ZhongDa hospital, along samples from 13 age- and
gender-matched healthy controls, were collected in EDTAcoated tubes. The plasma was then separated, collected
in EP tubes, and then stored at -40°C for later analysis.
Mononuclear cells were isolated on hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose (HaoYang, China) by centrifugation at
500 × g for 20 min. Afterwards, they were fixed in 1%
paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized using 0.1%
triton X-100 containing 0.5% BSA. The cells were
then incubated with specific rabbit, anti-human B2R
antibodies (Abcam, UK) on ice for 1 hour, followed by
incubation with a PE-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (Santa Cruz, USA) and a fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human CD34
antibody (BD Biosciences, USA) for 1 hour. Stained cells
were washed 3 times with PBS and then analyzed using
a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, USA) to
detect B2R labeling. The mononuclear cells were gated
according to forward scatter and side scatter. The CD34+
cells were defined as the FITC-positive cell group. CD34+
cells were then gated and B2R+ cells were identified as
PE-positive cells from among the CD34+ cells.
The concentration of plasma MPO, which reflects
oxidative stress level, was determined by assay using a
human MPO ELISA Kit (Boster, China) to determine the
degree of in vivo oxidative stress in patients with diabetes
and healthy controls.

Determination of H2O2-induced senescence
hEPCs were treated with either H2O2 alone or
BK plus H2O2 in 5% FBS-containing medium. Cells
were incubated with BK at either 0.1 or 1.0 nM for
30 min immediately before H2O2. To label senescent
cells, SA-Gal staining was performed 12 h after H2O2
treatment as previously described [48]. Briefly, cells
were washed in PBS and fixed in 2% formaldehyde and
0.2% glutaraldehyde for 5 min at room temperature, then
washed and incubated overnight at 37°C with SA-Gal
staining solution (150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM
K4[Fe(CN)6], and 5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6], in 40 mM citric
acid/sodium phosphate dibasic at pH 6.0, containing
1 mg/mL of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-Dgalactoside).
Light microscopy images were captured using an inverted
microscope at 200× magnification and senescent cells
were counted per microscopic field.

Human EPC culture and characterization
Human umbilical cord blood was obtained from
ZhongDa Hospital in accordance with the Medical
Ethics Committee of ZhongDa Hospital Affiliated with
Southeast University (approval ID: 2013ZDSYLL108.1)
and performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
The cord blood was diluted 1:1 ratio in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). The MNC fraction was then obtained via
centrifugation (500g for 15 min) using a Lymphoprep
density gradient (Sigma, USA), washed twice in PBS,
and then centrifuged at 300g for 10 min. The cell pellet
was suspended in endothelial basal growth medium
(EBM-2) supplemented with EGM-2 MV SingleQuots
(Lonza, USA) and 5% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum
(FBS). The solution was plated in a T-25 culture flask
coated with 10 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin (FN,
Millipore, USA). After 96 hours, the unbound cells were

Detection of intracellular oxygen radicals with a
dichlorofluorescein diacetate probe
This experiment attempted to confirm that H2O2induced senescence is caused by oxidative stress.
Twenty-four hours after seeding cells in 24-well clusters,
hEPCs were exposed to 300 μM H2O2 in 5% FBScontaining medium to induce production of intracellular
oxygen radicals. BK (0.1 nM or 1.0 nM) was administered
30 min before the addition of H2O2. Twelve hours after

initiating H2O2 exposure, cells in each well were washed
3 times in PBS, and then incubated in FBS-free medium
(1 mL per well). A 10 μM DCFH-DA probe was added
immediately and then incubated at 37°C for 20 min.
Intracellular oxygen radicals were then determined using
a fluorescence microscope at an absorption wave length
of 488 nm and an emission wave length of 530 nm. There
was no significant difference between 0.1 and 1.0 nM
BK (p > 0.05), for this and the previous assay, so lower
concentration was used for all remaining assays.

CO2. The transfection mixture was then removed and
replaced with normal growth medium and incubated for
an additional 24 hours. The cells were then treated with
either H2O2 alone or 0.1 nM BK plus H2O2 as described
above. SA-Gal staining was then used to determine
senescence and DCFH-DA probes visualized using a
fluorescence microscope at an absorption wavelength of
488 nm and emission wavelength of 530 nm as described
above.

hEPC expression of B2R by flow cytometry

Cell senescence PCR array

Cells were treated with H2O2 or H2O2 plus BK with
or without signaling pathway inhibitors as described
above, and then dissociated from the culture flask by
trypsinization and transferred to an EP tube. After cell
fixation in 1% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization
in 0.1% triton X-100 containing 0.5% BSA, cells were
incubated with specific rabbit anti-human B2R antibodies
(Abcam, UK) on ice for 1 hour, washed 3 times with
PBS, and then incubated with a PE-conjugated donkey
anti-rabbit second antibody for 1 hour. B2R expression
was quantified on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson, USA) with cells cultured in normal growth
medium used as control.

RT
Profiler PCR Arrays (PAHS-050A,
SABiosciences, Germany) were used to determine the
senescence-associated molecular signal pathways. One
well each of cells treated with either 300 μM H2O2 or
300  μM H2O2 plus 0.1 nM BK in 5% FBS-containing
medium for 12 hours were collected and total RNA was
extracted and cDNA synthesized as described below. The
analyzed genes are described in Supplemental Table 2.

Determination of the effect of a B2 receptor
antagonist or PI3K and EGFR signaling
pathway inhibitors on BK inhibition of oxidative
stress-induced senescence

RNA extraction and RT-PCR

The B2R antagonist HOE-140 (150 nM), PI3K
antagonist LY-294002 (10 μM), and EGFR antagonist
AG1478 (10 μM) were added to block the B2R, PI3K,
and EGFR separately for 5 min before the addition of
BK. hEPCs were treated with H2O2 alone or 0.1 nM BK
plus H2O2 as described above. SA-Gal staining was then
performed and light microscopy images were taken on an
inverted microscope (Nikon, Japan) at 200× magnification,
and the number of senescent cells was counted per
microscopic field. For detecting intracellular oxygen
radicals, the DCFH-DA probe was used as described
above and analyzed using a fluorescence microscope
at an absorption wavelength of 488 nm and emission
wavelength of 530 nm.

After cells with or without exposure to
signaling pathway inhibitors were treated with H2O2
or BK plus H2O2 as described above, the cells were
lysed using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA).
Total RNA was extracted according to the cell
RNA extraction protocol offered by Invitrogen and
cDNAs were synthesized using the PrimeScriptTM RT
reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (TAKARA, Japan).
RT-PCR was performed using B2R primers (sense:
5-TGCTGCTGCTATTCATCATC-3;
antisense:
5-CCAGTCCTGCAGTTTGTGAA-3), 18S rRNA
primers (sense: 5-CATGCTAACTAGTTACGCGACC-3;
antisense: 5-GAGCAATAACAGGTCTGTGATG-3) and
RB primers (sense: CGTGCGCTCTTGAGGTTGTAA;
antisense: TTGGTCCTTCTCGGTCCTTTG). After RT
(50°C, 30 min), hot start (94°C, 15 min), and 40 – 42
cycles of PCR (94°C, 1 min; 52.5°C, 1 min; 72°C, 1 min),
RB and B2R mRNA expression was normalized to 18S
rRNA and calculated as 2 − ∆∆Ct.

Transfection of human B2 receptor siRNA and
its effect on BK inhibition of oxidative stressinduced senescence
Cells were seeded in 6- or 24-well clusters or a T-25
culture flask and then incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 until
80% confluent. B2R siRNA was purchased from Santa
Cruz, USA. siRNA transfection solution was prepared
according to directions provided by Santa Cruz to make a
siRNA concentration of 400 nM. The cells were washed
once with siRNA transfection medium (Santa Cruz,
USA). Then, the appropriate siRNA transfection medium
and siRNA transfection solution was added to each well.
The cells were then incubated for 6 hours at 37°C in 5%

glycol tetraacetic acid). The lysates were centrifuged at
12,000g for 5 min, and then the supernatants were collected
to obtain the cytosolic proteins and stored at − 80°C. To
obtain the nuclear proteins, the lysis buffer (26% glycerol
[pH 7.9], 5 mM 2-[4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]
ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.5 mM DL-dithiothreitol,
300 mM NaCl) was added to the precipitation from the
previous step. Samples were vortexed for 30s out of every
2 min for 30 min, then centrifuged at 12000g for 10 min.
The supernatant was collected and stored at -80°C. Protein
concentrations were measured using the BCA assay kit
(Pierce, USA). Western blots were performed using
cytosolic protein samples to detect AKT, phosphorylated
Ser473-AKT (P-Ser473AKT) using rabbit monoclonal antihuman AKT antibodies or a rabbit monoclonal anti-human
phosphorylated Ser473-AKT antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology, USA). Nuclear proteins were used to detect
RB, phosphorylated Ser249, Thr252 RB (P-Ser249 and Thr252
RB), and cyclin D1 using rabbit monoclonal anti-human
phosphorylated Ser249, Thr 252RB antibodies and a rabbit
monoclonal anti-human cyclin D1 antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology, USA). GAPDH was used as a loading control
(KangCheng Bio-tech, China). After primary antibody
incubation, blots were incubated with the appropriate
secondary horseradish peroxidase conjugate mouse
monoclonal anti-rabbit antibody (Boster, China). Each
membrane was washed and then developed using the
SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, USA).
