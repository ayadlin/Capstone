BACKGROUND: Epoetin a (EPO) continues to be the initial treatment of choice for most anemic patients
with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Over the years, different therapeutic strategies have been adopted
to optimize the clinical benefits of EPO in this setting. METHODS: In the current meta-analysis of published
literature, erythroid response (ER) rates with EPO as a single agent versus its combination with granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
were compared. RESULTS: The assessment indicated that the ER rates were comparable between the 2
EPO-based therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, EPO monotherapy at a higher dose of 60,000 to 80,000
U weekly produced significantly higher ER rates (64.5%) compared with the standard oncology dose of
30,000 to 40,000 U weekly either as a single agent (49%; P < .001) or in combination with G-CSF/GM-CSF
(50.6% P ¼ .007). In addition, when transfusion-dependent patients were assessed separately, both EPO
monotherapy and its combination with G-CSF/GM-CSF produced comparable and appreciable levels of
transfusion independence (28.8% and 24.8%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In the current meta-analysis,
higher doses of EPO demonstrated better ER rates compared with EPO at standard doses alone or in combination with G-CSF/GM-CSF. Furthermore, the authors concluded that prospective clinical studies are warranted to evaluate the use of higher doses of EPO in anemic patients with MDS. Cancer 2009;115:706–15.

EPO Therapy of MDS/Mundle et al

KEY WORDS: epoetin, myelodysplastic syndromes, granuylocyte–colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte
macrophage–colony-stimulating factor, anemia.

Refractory anemia in myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS) is a well established clinical hallmark observed in
the vast majority of patients. Despite the availability of 3
therapeutic agents approved for the treatment of MDS by
the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
(lenalidomide, 5-azacytidine and decitabine), for the majority of patients, erythropoietin continues to be the initial
choice of treatment.1 Recombinant human erythropoietin
or epoetin a (EPO) was the first and had remained the
most widely used erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA)
in MDS since the early 1990s. In a previous meta-analysis,
we demonstrated that the erythroid response (ER) rates in
more recent studies have improved significantly, primarily
with the use of standardized response evaluation criteria
from the International Working Group (IWG) in MDS.2
In addition, the appropriate selection of patients with low
erythrocyte (RBC) transfusion requirement and low
endogenous serum erythropoietin (sEPO) levels also
have enhanced the ER rates.2,3
Historically, although the clinical benefit of EPO
therapy always was appreciated in MDS, the ER rates
observed with EPO monotherapy were modest (approximately 15%-20%).4 In an attempt to improve the
response to EPO therapy, white blood cell growth factors,
such as granulocyte– or granulocyte-macrophage–colonystimulating factors (G-/GM-CSF), have been combined
with EPO. The initial rationale for this combination was
that cytopenia of granulocytic and/or megakaryocytic lineage often accompany anemia in patients with MDS.
However, subsequently, a direct effect of G-CSF was
demonstrated in suppressing apoptotic death and promoting the survival of early hematopoietic progenitors
derived from the bone marrow of patients with MDS.5
Because of the paucity of direct comparative studies,
it is difficult to discern the true clinical benefit of combination therapy over EPO alone. Moreover, it has
been demonstrated that a higher dose of EPO as a single
agent (60,000-80,000 U per week) also improved ER
rates compared with a standard weekly oncology dose of
30,000 to 40,000 U.3,6 With the availability of a patient
selection model and standardized IWG response evaluaCancer

tion criteria, it would be interesting to study which therapeutic strategy yields a better response to EPO. In the
current meta-analysis, we attempted to draw a comparative profile between EPO monotherapy versus EPO in
combination with G-/GM-CSF. In addition, a separate
assessment of ER rates in transfusion-dependent patients
was conducted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Literature Search
We performed a systematic search of the medical literature for studies evaluating ER rate of various treatments in
patients with MDS during a period of 1990 to 2007 using
the PubMed database. The search was conducted using
the following combination of keywords:
• ‘‘Myelodysplastic or myelodysplasia or MDS’’; AND
• ‘‘Treatment or therapy or monotherapy or polytherapy or
agent’’; AND

• ‘‘Erythroid or response’’; AND
• ‘‘G-CSF or GM-CSF’’ or ‘‘erythropoietin or epoetin’’ or
‘‘thalidomide or IL-3 or interleukin-3 or retinoic acid or
tretinoin or pentoxifylline or ciprofloxacin or steroid or
antithymocyte globulin or lenalidomide or 5-azacytidine
or decitabine or (cytarabine or cytosine arabinoside and
low dose) or etanercept or infliximab or amifostine or
arsenic trioxide.’’

The search cutoff date was September 30, 2007. An
additional search for abstracts from the American Society
of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the American Society
of Hematology (ASH) proceedings also was performed.
We conducted this wider review of the literature
with several study objectives in mind. For the current
research, we identified the studies that evaluated epoetin a
as a single agent or in combination with G-/GM-CSF.
The results of the search initially were analyzed in title and
abstract format. Reference sections from the selected publications were checked for additional articles or abstracts.
Items were selected based on an initial search for a full707

text analysis to determine the eligibility of the article for
our analysis.

Criteria for Inclusion of Studies for Analysis
We included all studies and abstracts that evaluated the
effectiveness of epoetin a as a monotherapy or in combination with G-CSF or GM-CSF for the treatment of anemia in MDS. The only additional criterion applied was
the availability of the ER rate to assess treatment effectiveness in patients who were naive to erythropoietic treatment. Studies that were published in languages other than
English were included in this review if the relevant data
for the analysis were available from the abstract.

hemoglobin [Hb] level from baseline and/or complete
transfusion independence) or minor (ie, an increase from
1 to <2 g/dL in the Hb level from baseline and/or a
reduction 50% in transfusion requirements) response
that is sustainable for 2 months.7
Univariate baseline statistics were generated for all
studies. Frequency counts and percentages were used to
summarize categorical variables, whereas means and
ranges were used to describe continuous variables. Statistical comparisons between groups were conducted using
chi-square tests for categorical variables and 2-sided
Student t tests for continuous variables.

Meta-Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the
data collected. Each reviewer evaluated the relevant data
from eligible studies and entered the information electronically into an Excel data collection form with prespecified
fields. If relevant data were reported only graphically, then
values were estimated by measuring the charts. Quality
control was done by comparing the 2 independent datasets,
and any differences noted were reconciled by a third party
by referring to the original sources. Data on the study
design and outcomes were collected for each included
study. These included the number of patients enrolled, the
study design (eg, definition of ER), baseline characteristics
of patients, dosing regimen, and the ER rate.

Pooled estimates of ER rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each group using fixedeffects or random-effects meta-analysis methods, depending on the heterogeneity test.8 Under the random-effects
model, it is assumed that, in addition to variability within
studies, there also is variability among studies. This interstudy variability was assessed using the I2 statistic and was
tested by the heterogeneity test, in which a low P value
implies that the study results are heterogeneous. In such
cases, a random-effects model is more appropriate than a
fixed-effects model.
A 2-sided a error of .05 was used to determine statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed
using SAS software (release 9.1 or newer; SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, NC) or Intercooled Stata 9.0 software.

Analytical Approach

RESULTS

Only those studies that used IWG 2000 response evaluation criteria or IWG-like criteria were stratified by treatment group as standard-dose EPO (30,000-40,000 U per
week) alone or in combination with G-/GM-CSF or as single-agent EPO at high dose (60,000-80,000 U per week).
For the first objective, the 3 groups were compared for
overall ER rate and for major ERs. Our second objective
was to assess the ER rate specifically in transfusion-dependent patients with MDS comparing EPO monotherapy
versus EPO in combination with G-/GM-CSF.
The ER rate was the outcome measure for our metaanalyses. According to IWG response criteria, an ER is
defined as either major (ie, an increase 2 g/dL in the

Erythroid Response to Different Strategies
of Epoetin a Treatment
All studies that were included in the current meta-analysis
evaluated ER rates using IWG 2000 or IWG-like criteria.7

FIGURE 2. Comparison of the pooled estimates of erythroid
response (ER) with different therapeutic strategies using
epoetin a (EPO). An asterisk indicates that major ER rates
were available from 5 of 6 studies. Std., standard; G-/GMCSF, granuylocyte–/granulocyte macrophage–colony-stimulating factor.

According to these criteria, a major ER was defined as an
increase 2 g/dL in Hb and/or complete transfusion
independence, whereas a minor ER was defined as an
increase from 1 to <2 g/dL in Hb and/or a reduction
50% in the transfusion requirement compared with the
pretreatment level or requirement. A response had to be
sustainable for 2 months.
The pooled overall ER rates were comparable when
the 2 standard EPO strategies were assessed. Figure 2
shows that the ER rate with standard-dose EPO monotherapy was 49% (95% CI, 44%-54%), whereas the rate
with a combination of standard-dose EPO plus G-/GMCSF was 50.6% (95% CI, 43%-58%; P ¼ .731). In contrast, the high-dose EPO studies revealed a significantly
higher ER rate of 64.5% (95% CI, 58%-71%) compared
with the rate for standard-dose EPO monotherapy (P <
.001) or standard-dose EPO plus G-/GM-CSF (P ¼
.007). In parallel, the major ER rates also were highest in
high-dose EPO studies among the 3 therapeutic strategies
studied (P < .01 vs both standard-dose EPO alone and
standard-dose EPO plus G-/GM-CSF). In all studies
taken together, a univariate metaregression analysis
revealed that greater proportions of patients who had RA
or RARS (P ¼ .001) and lower sEPO levels (P < .001)
were associated with significantly higher ER rates.

CSF in different French-American-British (FAB) histologic categories. Because of the limited availability of data
on individual FAB groups in different studies, the standard-dose and high-dose EPO monotherapy groups were
analyzed as a single comparator against combination
therapy. With both therapeutic strategies, as expected,
patients who had RA or RARS had higher ER rates compared with the other FAB groups taken together. Within
the individual FAB groups tested, however, the overall ER
rates were comparable between patients treated with EPO
monotherapy versus EPO plus G-/GM-CSF.

Erythroid Response in TransfusionDependent Patients
It is well established that the clinical benefit of EPO is
more pronounced in anemic patients with MDS who do
not require regular RBC transfusion. However, transfusion independence with EPO therapy in regularly transfused patients also has been noted previously. Therefore,
in the current meta-analysis, we also assessed the clinical
benefit of adding G-/GM-CSF to EPO specifically in
transfusion-dependent patients. The data on transfusion
dependent patients were derived from 6 EPO monotherapy studies6,9-13 (4 standard-dose EPO studies and 2
high-dose EPO studies) and from all 6 studies that used
the combination therapy.17-22 Because of the limited
availability of data, the standard-dose and high-dose EPO
monotherapy groups were analyzed as a single comparator
against the combination therapy.
There were 192 evaluable transfusion-dependent
patients in 6 studies that used EPO monotherapy and
115 evaluable patients in 6 studies that used EPO plus
G-/GM-CSF. The mean pretherapy RBC transfusion
requirement per month in these patients in the 2 study
groups was comparable (2.37 U vs 2.33 U, respectively).
In addition, the mean (standard deviation) sEPO levels
were comparable between the 2 groups (EPO monotherapy, 374.3  72.2 mU/mL; EPO plus G-/GM-CSF, 288
 172.1 mU/mL). The initial mean(standard deviation) weekly dose of EPO was 49,326  22,752 U in
the monotherapy group and 34,789  12,083 U in the
combination therapy group.
Figure 3 shows that there was no significant difference in the overall ER rates elicited by EPO as a single
agent or in combination with G-/GM-CSF (41.6% vs

36.4%, respectively; P ¼ .643). Moreover, in both
groups, similar proportions of patients achieved major ER
or complete transfusion independence (28.8% vs 24.8%,
respectively; P ¼ .705). In addition, when the ER rates
were assessed according to FAB categories in transfusiondependent patients, no significant differences were noted
between the 2 treatment strategies (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
For well over 15 years, erythropoietin has been used therapeutically in patients with MDS to alleviate the major
symptom of these disorders, namely RA. Several attempts
have been made in the past to improve ER rates and optimize the clinical benefit of this therapeutic agent in MDS.
Currently, it is used as a single agent at a standard oncology dose of 30,000 to 40,000 U per week; or as a single
agent at higher doses of 60,000 to 80,000 U per week; or
in combination with white blood cell growth factors, GCSF, or GM-CSF. To our knowledge, with the exception
of 1 study on epoetin b,23 no information is available on
how these strategies of using EPO therapy compare in
terms of the ER rate in patients with MDS. Our current
meta-analysis demonstrates clearly that both the overall
ER rate and the major ER rate were comparable between
standard-dose EPO monotherapy and standard-dose
EPO plus G-/GM-CSF. Conversely, increasing the dose
of EPO to 60,000 to 80,000 U per week as a single agent
appeared to yield a higher ER rate than either of the standard-dose EPO strategies.

Review Article

The results of the current meta-analysis support a
recent meta-analysis by French investigators, who compared patient-level data that indicated no increase in the
ER rate when an ESA was combined with G-CSF.24 Furthermore, in the French study, an ESA was used at a
higher dose (60,000 U per week EPO or epoetin b or 300
lg per week darbepoetin a), the overall ER rate reported
using IWG 2000 criteria was 62%, and the major ER rate
was 40%. In parallel, the high-dose EPO group in our
analysis had an overall ER rate of 64.5% and a 44.9%
major response rate, corroborating the observations
reported in the French study.
Although currently there does not appear to be a
prospective trial directly comparing the combination of
EPO plus G-CSF with the combination of EPO plus
GM-CSF, the previous meta-analysis of independent clinical data on the 2 combinations underscored the higher
efficacy of G-CSF over GM-CSF in every histologic subgroup of MDS.25 In the current analysis, in the combination therapy group, there were 3 studies each that used
EPO plus G-CSF (96 patients) and EPO plus GM-CSF
(56 patients). Although it was shy of statistical significance, with the G-CSF combination, a higher ER rate
(55.2%) was observed, similar to the report by Kasper et
al, compared with the GM-CSF combination (ER rate;
42.8% P ¼ .142).
It is well established that requiring a transfusion is a
poor prognostic factor for response to EPO therapy.
According to the ER prediction model proposed by
Hellstrom-Lindberg and coworkers,26 if the transfusion
requirement is >2 U of RBC per month, then the ER rate
may be affected significantly. The studies that were
included in our meta-analysis had a sizeable proportion of
patients who reportedly were transfusion dependent.
Although the percentage of transfusion-dependent patients
appeared to be higher in the EPO plus G-/
GM-CSF group, the mean pretherapy RBC transfusion
requirement per month was comparable both in the EPO
monotherapy groups (2.37 U per month) and in the EPO
plus G-/GM-CSF group (2.33 U per month). Unfortunately, the pretransfusion Hg levels were not reported in
the reports that were included in the current meta-analysis.
Thus, no comparison could be drawn on the trigger for
transfusion initiation between the groups. However, in
both groups, the mean sEPO levels were <500 mU/mL.
Thus, according to the response prediction model
712

described above, with a transfusion requirement >2 U per
month and an sEPO level <500 mU/mL, the expected ER
rate would be approximately 23%.26 Indeed, our assessment produced ER rates of 42% and 36.4% with monotherapy and combination therapy, respectively, and
approximately 25% of patients achieving complete transfusion independence in both groups. This observation is supported by the earlier patient-level retrospective analysis by
the Nordic group, which reported a 29% transfusion independence rate with EPO plus G-CSF.27 In addition, when
only the transfusion-dependent patients were considered,
other agents (including decitabine, arsenic trioxide, and
thalidomide) appeared to yield comparable or lower levels
of transfusion independence.28-30 Moreover, lenalidomide
in patients without chromosome 5q deletion yielded comparable level of transfusion independence (approximately
25%).31 However, in patients with 5q abnormalities,
lenalidomide appeared to yield a significantly higher proportion of transfusion independence (>65%) and, hence,
is an approved therapy for this category of low-risk patients
with 5q deletion.32 In our analysis, lower sEPO levels, at
least in part must have overcome the adverse effect of transfusion dependency and, in turn, contributed to the appreciable responses observed in transfusion-dependent patients
with both EPO-based strategies studied. In general, the
lower sEPO levels in our meta-analysis were associated with
higher ER rates. Otherwise, with sEPO levels >500 mU/
mL and regular transfusion dependency, the response prediction model would estimate an ER rate <10% on EPO
with or without G-CSF.26
Along with a low RBC transfusion requirement and
low sEPO levels, the probability of achieving a response to
EPO therapies appears to be greater if the bone marrow
blast count is <10%.24 Thus, patients primarily in lowrisk and intermediate-1–risk categories according to the
International Prognostic Scoring System appear to be
appropriate candidates for EPO therapy. Unfortunately,
because of the lack of adequate data, it was not possible to
analyze this parameter in our current literature meta-analysis. Alternatively, however, according to the FAB diagnostic classification, the RA or RARS category, which
generally includes patients with less advanced disease
compared with other FAB categories, was associated positively with the ER rate.24
Safety parameters were not included in the current
meta-analysis. However, 2 publications on the long-term

follow-up of Nordic and French patients who received
ESAs with or without G-CSF have reported no adverse
effect on leukemic progression compared with historic
controls who received supportive care only.24,27 In addition, whereas the Nordic study also reported no adverse
effect on the overall survival of patients who received an
ESA with or without G-CSF, the French study demonstrated a significantly reduced hazard ratio for treated
patients and especially a benefit in patients who
responded to an ESA with or without G-CSF. Similarly,
another recent meta-analysis specifically in low-risk to
intermediate-1–risk patients reported no adverse effect
of hematopoietic growth factor treatment on the rate of
either leukemic transformation or survival.33 In light of
several deleterious effects of prolonged RBC transfusions
in patients with MDS, as reviewed previously,34,35 the
objectives of treatment in patients who have low-risk to
intermediate-1– risk disease are to delay transfusion dependence or avoid transfusions in those who require them
regularly. On the basis of the current meta-analysis, EPObased therapies appear to fulfill these therapeutic
objectives.
It must be acknowledged that, as listed in Table 1, a
relatively greater proportion of transfusion-dependent
patients in the EPO plus G-/GM-CSF group and patients
with RA or RARS who had the lowest sEPO levels in the
high-dose EPO group may have influenced the ER rates
in the current meta-analysis. Furthermore, this study,
similar to meta-analyses in general, has some additional
limitations. First, only EPO studies were considered for
the current analysis. Studies that used either epoetin b (an
ESA that is not available in the United States) or darbepoetin a were not included because of the very small
number of available reports with these agents. Second, 1
study15 from peer-reviewed abstracts/posters was included
in the current analysis. A differential distribution of such
reports in different study groups may introduce an information bias. Third, although meta-analysis has the ability
to improve the power of small or inconclusive studies, it
cannot improve the quality of reporting of the original
studies. Fourth, the lack of primary source data from the
original studies is also another limitation to this analysis,
because an ecologic bias may influence results.36 In this
analysis, the original studies were weighted based on
standard meta-analysis methods,8 which tend to favor
studies with a larger sample size. However, the quality

of the original studies (eg, randomized vs observational
design) was not considered. Furthermore, the total number of studies on EPO monotherapy or its combination
with G-/GM-CSF in MDS was relatively small, and data
regarding reported durations of follow-up were limited,
suggesting that these results may be considered hypothesis-generating. Finally, the studies reported in this metaanalysis included very little data regarding the long-term
safety of using ESAs in the setting of MDS. Further prospective, randomized, comparative trials are necessary to
compare the validity of the current results and to evaluate
long-term safety.
Among all patients with newly diagnosed MDS, as
many as 60% to 70% may have low-risk to intermediate1–risk disease and are suitable for EPO-based therapy.37
Two previous patient-level meta-analyses in independent
demographic populations and our current literature metaanalysis, which included results from diverse demographic
populations, demonstrated that the efficacy of EPO is
well established.24,27 The patient-level meta-analyses also
demonstrated that the rates of leukemic transformation
and overall survival in these patients are not affected by
EPO-based treatment24,27; in fact, there may be a survival
advantage in responding patients.24 Our meta-analysis
also indicated that a higher dose of EPO alone actually
may produce a better response compared with the combination of a standard dose with G-/GM-CSF in anemic
patients with MDS. This possibility needs to be tested in a
prospective trial in the future.
