BACKGROUND: The use of rituximab together with intensive chemotherapy in Burkitt’s lymphoma or leukemia (BL) has been scarcely
explored. This study prospectively evaluated and compared the outcome and toxicity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and HIV-negative patients with BL who were treated in an intensive immunochemotherapy-based and age-adapted trial.
METHODS: A total of 118 adult patients (80 HIV-negative and 38 HIV-positive) aged 15 to 83 years were treated with 4 (nonbulky
stages I-II) or 6 (stages II bulky, III-IV) cycles of intensive chemotherapy combined with rituximab. Reduction in chemotherapy doses
and modification of the cycle schedules was performed in patients older than 55 years. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of HIVpositive patients were comparable with those who were HIV-negative. Complete remission rates were 82% and 87%, respectively, and
9 patients died in induction, 9 died in remission, and 7 relapsed. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, nonsignificant differences
were observed in the 4-year disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) probabilities (77% and 63% for HIV-positive and 80% and
78% for HIV-negative patients, respectively). Young HIV-infected patients presented higher incidences of grade 3 or 4 mucositis and
severe infectious episodes. Poor general status and bone marrow involvement, but not advanced age, were associated with a shorter
OS, allowing the definition of 3 prognostic groups, with the OS ranging from 50% to 92%. CONCLUSIONS: Age-adapted intensive
immunochemotherapy is highly effective in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients, with a higher toxicity in the latter group.

INTRODUCTION
Burkitt’s lymphoma or leukemia (BL) is a highly aggressive mature B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, with high incidence
in immunosuppressed patients in Western countries, especially when associated with human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infection.1 The standard treatment consists of specific regimens incorporating intensive courses of chemotherapy
with fractionated alkylating agents and phase-specific agents capable of crossing the blood–brain barrier. Intensive chemotherapy regimens have improved the outcome in both children and adults.2 Some uncontrolled studies suggest that the
addition of rituximab is efficacious and may be particularly valuable in adult patients.3
In HIV-associated lymphomas, the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to an improved tolerance to full-dose chemotherapy. However, the outcomes for HIV-infected patients have only been occasionally compared

with those from HIV-negative patients receiving the same
chemotherapeutic protocols.4 The addition of rituximab
has proven to be effective in aggressive lymphomas arising
in HIV-infected patients.5
In the Spanish PETHEMA (Programa Español de
Tratamiento en Hematologı́a) cooperative group, patients
with BL have been routinely treated with specific regimens irrespective of HIV status.6 In July 2003, a trial adding rituximab to a specific regimen for BL (the
BURKIMAB trial) was activated. A report of the first 36
patients (17 HIV-negative and 19 HIV-infected) in
advanced stages showed the feasibility of the inclusion of
HIV-infected patients, with similar outcome.7 We report
the final analysis of this trial, including a study of prognostic factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility and Diagnostic Criteria

The PETHEMA Group adapted the study B-ALL/
NHL2002 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00199082)
from the GMALL (German Multicenter Study Group for
the Treatment of Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia)
for the treatment of BL. The main modification in the
Spanish study (BURKIMAB, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT00388193) was the inclusion of patients with HIVrelated BL. Accrual began in July 2003 for HIV-negative
patients and in September 2004 for HIV-positive individuals, and the study was closed for inclusion in July 2011
and for follow-up in December 2011.
Inclusion criteria were age higher than 15 years and
BL confirmed by morphology, immunological markers
(including CD20 positivity), and cytogenetics. HIVinfected patients had to be under or had to begin
HAART. The study was approved by the institutional
research boards of the PETHEMA Group and of each
center. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Diagnosis of BLL was performed according to the
Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid
Neoplasms (REAL/WHO) criteria,8 and cases were
reclassified according to the World Health Organization
Classification9 after review of pathologic reports. Bone
marrow (BM) involvement was assessed by aspiration or
biopsy (in case of absence of infiltration by BM aspiration). Cytogenetic studies were performed in each center
using direct methods and unstimulated short-term (24
and 48 hours) cultures with G-banding,10 and the reports
were centrally reviewed. Burkitt’s leukemia was defined as
> 20% Burkitt’s cells in BM. Central nervous system
(CNS) disease was defined as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
involvement by Burkitt’s cells, cranial nerve palsy not

related to a facial tumor, clinical signs of spinal cord compression, or an intracranial mass.
Parameters Evaluated

The following data were analyzed at baseline: general status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score); the
main hematologic and biochemical tests; computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis;
BM study; CSF study; and age-adjusted International
Prognostic Index (aaIPI).11 Bulky disease was defined as a
tumor mass > 10 cm in diameter. In HIV-infected
patients, HIV viral load and CD4 lymphocyte counts
were also recorded.
After therapy, the following evaluations were performed: physical examination, hematologic and biochemical parameters, BM study (if positive at diagnosis), and
CT scans of the involved areas at baseline, in addition to
CD4 count and viral load of HIV for HIV-infected
patients. Response was evaluated after 2 therapy cycles
and at the end of the fourth or sixth cycles for patients in
localized or advanced stages, respectively. Patients in complete response (CR) were evaluated every 3 months during
the first year, every 6 months during the second year, and
annually thereafter.
Chemotherapy Regimen

Table 1 shows the therapy of the patients. Patients in
advanced stage (bulky stages II or stages III-IV) and
younger than 55 years received 2 courses of cycles A, B,
and C, whereas older patients received 3 courses of alternating cycles A and B, for a total of 6 cycles. Patients with
localized stage (nonbulky stages I-II) received 4 cycles of
treatment. Reduction of 50% in methotrexate and cytarabine doses was performed in patients older than 55 years.
A single dose of rituximab was administered before each
cycle. After completion of chemotherapy, those patients
in advanced stages who experienced CR received 2 additional doses of rituximab. CNS prophylaxis consisted of 8
doses of triple intrathecal therapy (TIT). CNS-directed
therapy included TIT chemotherapy twice weekly until
normalization of the cytologic study of CSF. Once they
achieved a negative CSF status, patients followed the prophylactic scheme described above.
Supportive Care and Complementary Treatment

Intravenous hydration, rasburicase use, and general supportive measures were not prescribed by the protocol. The
dose of methotrexate was reduced to 0.5 g/m2 in patients
with levels of creatinine > 2 mg/dL or bilirubin > 2 mg/
dL, and 25% to 50% of dose reduction of methotrexate,
cytarabine, and vincristine were recommended if severe

mucositis, liver toxicity, or severe neurotoxicity occurred
in previous cycles.
HAART was not uniform in all patients, but should
include 1 protease inhibitor or a non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and was started at BLL diagnosis in
HIV-infected patients who did not previously receive it.
Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis was scheduled for HIVinfected patients who had a CD4 cell count below 200/lL
at baseline. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was
allowed for use from neutrophils < 0.5  109/L until recovery for each cycle.
Response Criteria, Outcome Measures, and
Evaluation of Toxicity

Complete response was defined as disappearance of extramedullary disease, as determined by physical examination
and imaging studies after 2 cycles. In cases of Burkitt’s
leukemia, a normocellular marrow with < 5% blasts and
1662

recovery of peripheral blood counts was required. Partial
remission (PR) was defined as > 50% reduction of all measurable lesions. Progressive disease (PD) was considered
when > 25% increase in the size of lesions was documented.
Both PR and PD were considered as treatment failures.
Early death (ED) was defined as death within 8
weeks of therapy onset (before first response evaluation).
Treatment failure was defined when a patient did not
reach PR after the first 2 cycles or CR after 4. Relapse was
defined as disease recurrence at any site after at least 2
months of documented CR. Overall survival (OS) was
calculated from the date of diagnosis to death or to the last
follow-up. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the
time interval between CR and relapse, death due to any
cause, or to the date of the last follow-up.
Toxicity was evaluated according to National Cancer
Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0.
Statistical Methods

Toxicity, response to therapy, and prognostic factors for
ED, CR, OS, and DFS were the main variables under
study. Chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test, Student t test, or
Kruskal-Wallis test were used for comparisons of baseline
characteristics and for comparisons among study groups.
Prognostic factors associated with early death and CR
were calculated using the Student t test or chi-square test
when appropriate. In the multivariate analysis, odds ratios
and the 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated by logistic regression analysis. Survival curves were
plotted according to the Kaplan-Meier method12 and
were compared by the log-rank test.13 The Cox proportional hazard ratio model was used for univariate and multivariate survival analyses.14
RESULTS
Patients

A total of 140 patients were registered at 23 Spanish centers, of whom 118 were valid for this study. Twenty-two
patients (16%) were excluded because they fulfilled the
WHO criteria for B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with
features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt’s lymphoma9 after review of the pathologic reports. Table 2 shows the characteristics of
the 118 valid patients (80 HIV-negative and 38 HIVpositive). The cohorts of HIV-positive and HIV-negative
patients were comparable for the main clinical and biological parameters at diagnosis. There was a trend to a lower
frequency of Burkitt’s leukemia in HIV-infected patients.
In HIV-positive patients, the CD4 lymphocyte count
was lower than 200/lL in 21 of 37 cases (57%)

Response to Treatment and Survival

Table 3 shows the main outcomes of the whole series and
of the HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. Although
no statistically significant differences in any response parameter were observed between HIV-positive and HIVnegative patients, it is notable that ED was more frequent
in HIV-infected patients. Infection was the cause of all
early deaths.
Among patients achieving CR (n ¼ 101), toxicity
led to permanent interruption of treatment in 5 cases
and 9 additional patients died in CR, during the treatment (6 in C1, 1 in A2, 1 in B2, and 1 in C2), with
the main cause of death being infection (Table 3). After
a median follow-up of 2.5 years (range ¼ 0.5-6.8 years),
7 relapses (4 in bone marrow, 2 in CNS, and 1 in small
bowel) have been documented, with the 4-year DFS
probability of 80% (95% confidence interval
[CI] ¼ 69%-91%) (Fig. 1A) showing no differences
between the 2 cohorts of patients. Thirty patients have
died (9 in induction, 1 after withdrawal from therapy, 6
after failure, 9 in remission, and 5 after relapse). Two
patients are alive in second CR after rescue chemotherapy. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
was performed in 1 patient and the remaining patient
was waiting for transplantation at the time of this
report. The 4-year OS probability of the series was 73%
(95% CI ¼ 65%-81%) (Fig. 1B), with only a trend for
a lower survival in HIV-infected patients (78%

influenced the probability of ED, whereas CNS involvement at baseline was associated with a lower probability of
CR (Table 5), BM involvement was associated with a
shorter DFS, and poor general status and BM involvement were associated with a shorter OS (Table 6). There
was no relationship between the CD4 lymphocyte count
at the end of the treatment (median ¼ 200 [range ¼ 1659]/lL) and the DFS and OS. According to the presence
of 0, 1, or 2 prognostic factors for survival, 3 groups with
different survival were identified with 4-year survival
probabilities ranging from 50% to 92% (Fig. 2).
Treatment-Related Toxicity

Tables 7 and 8 show the toxicity according to the age
groups, the cycle of chemotherapy, and HIV infection
status. In HIV-infected patients younger than 55 years,
hematologic toxicity, mucositis, and infections were significantly more frequent than in HIV-negative patients,
whereas no differences in toxicity were observed in
patients  55 years according to HIV infection status.
Interestingly, no significant differences were observed in
the overall frequency of grade 3 or 4 infections on comparison of the age groups (161 infections in 438 chemotherapy cycles [37%] in young patients versus 37 of 125
[30%] in older patients). Granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor was effectively used in the 91% of the cycles, without differences in both age groups.

DISCUSSION
This final analysis shows that this age-adapted immunochemotherapeutic schedule is feasible and effective for
adult patients with BL, regardless of their HIV infection
status, although more hematologic, mucosal, and infectious toxicities were observed in young HIV-infected
patients. General status and the presence of CNS and BM
involvement, but not age, were the main prognostic
factors.
The development of specific chemotherapies by pediatric groups has been the main hallmark in the therapy
of BL, with curability indexes of approximately 80% to
90% of cases.15,16 The adaptation of these schedules to
adults has led to an increase in the response rate and survival, ranging from 60% to 70% of cases in some series.17
The addition of rituximab to these specific therapies may
represent a step forward in the therapy of BL. Although
no randomized trials on the use of rituximab have been
published to date, and most of the studies are retrospective
and include a limited number of patients, the tolerability
and efficacy of specific immunochemotherapy seems to be

good, with response rates between 70% and 90% and survival ranging from 70% to 80%.17-21
The high frequency of virologic and immunologic
response to HAART and the improvement in supportive
therapy have encouraged some groups to treat patients
who have HIV-related BL with the same aggressive schedules as those used in patients without immune suppression, with promising results and acceptable tolerability.2226
Several studies have added rituximab to these schedules,

according to the prognostic factors.

with results comparable to those obtained in HIVnegative patients.27,28 However, to our knowledge, no
prospective comparison between HIV-positive and HIVnegative patients with BL has been performed.
The BURKIMAB study prospectively evaluated the
efficacy and tolerability of the specific immunochemotherapy B-ALL/NHL2002 protocol from the GMALL
group,17 with the main modification being the inclusion
of patients with HIV-related BLL. This was consistent
with our previous studies showing the applicability and
equivalent results of specific chemotherapeutic schedules
in HIV-positive and HIV-negative BL patients.7,29 A
report of the first 36 patients (17 HIV-negative and 19
HIV-infected) in advanced stages showed the applicability
of this schedule in both groups of patients, with similar
outcomes.7 In this final analysis, both cohorts of patients
had similar baseline characteristics. The CR was similar in
both groups, and the frequency of relapses or resistant disease was very low. A matter of concern was the high frequency (9%) of deaths (mainly due to infection),
occurring in patients in remission during chemotherapy,
being slightly higher in HIV-infected than in HIV-negative patients. Although the relapse rate, DFS, and OS
were not significantly different in HIV-positive and HIVnegative patients, grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression and
mucositis were more common in young HIV-infected
patients, with major infection in half of the cycles.

Although CD4 counts were assessed at the end of therapy,
the lack of monitoring of HIV viral load and CD4 lymphocyte counts during and sequentially after the treatment could not allow us to determine if there were
differences in toxicity and outcomes based on these features. In both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients
aged 55 years or older, the frequency of cytopenias was
similar but the duration was lower, with fewer infections
and mucositis, probably due to reduced intensity of chemotherapy given to these patients.
The prognostic factors identified in this study (CNS
and BM involvement and poor general status) are consistent with those identified in other trials15-28 or in population-based studies30 with the exception of advanced age.
We have attributed the lack of poor prognosis in older
patients to 2 features. First, the strategy of dose reduction
and schedule modification for older patients did not
translate into a lower remission rate or increased relapse
rate in this population. Second, there was not an excess of
toxicity causing treatment-related deaths in older patients
in this study. Other trials such as Hyper-CVAD and rituximab showed improvement in disease-related outcomes of
de novo BL, particularly for older patients. Future trials
should therefore examine whether less-intensive treatment
protocols including rituximab can reduce toxicity while
maintaining high efficacy. In addition, improved therapeutic strategies are needed for the poorest prognostic
group of patients, who have only a 50% probability of
survival.
In spite of similar baseline characteristics and results
of treatment in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients,
a selection bias cannot be ruled out in this study, especially
Cancer

for the HIV-infected patients, in whom the frequency of
BL was lower. However, the high survival rate observed in
HIV-related BL also supports the use of intensive protocols with age-adapted immunochemotherapy in these
patients. These regimens are feasible, with high CR and
very low relapse rates. However, the toxicity is relevant
especially with regard to infections and mucositis. The
occurrence of deaths during chemotherapy in patients in
CR calls for future trials examining protocols with
decreased dose-intensity in postremission therapy. The
use of risk-adapted therapy, the incorporation of targeted
therapies, and the study of minimal residual disease will
be useful in the definition of future therapeutic strategies.
