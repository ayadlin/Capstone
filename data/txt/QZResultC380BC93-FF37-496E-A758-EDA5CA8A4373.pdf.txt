Abstract
Small-molecule inhibitors of Hsp90 show promise in the treatment of castrate-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC); however, these inhibitors trigger a heat shock response that attenuates drug effectiveness. Attenuation
is associated with increased expression of Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp27, and clusterin (CLU) that mediate tumor cell
survival and treatment resistance. We hypothesized that preventing CLU induction in this response would
enhance Hsp90 inhibitor–induced CRPC cell death in vitro and in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we treated CRPC
with the Hsp90 inhibitor PF-04929113 or 17-AAG in the absence or presence of OGX-011, an antisense drug that
targets CLU. Treatment with either Hsp90 inhibitor alone increased nuclear translocation and transcriptional
activity of the heat shock factor HSF-1, which stimulated dose- and time-dependent increases in HSP expression,
especially CLU expression. Treatment-induced increases in CLU were blocked by OGX-011, which synergistically
enhanced the activity of Hsp90 inhibition on CRPC cell growth and apoptosis. Accompanying these effects was a
decrease in HSF-1 transcriptional activity as well as expression of HSPs, Akt, prostate-specific antigen, and
androgen receptor. In vivo evaluation of the Hsp90 inhibitors with OGX-011 in xenograft models of human CRPC
showed that OGX-011 markedly potentiated antitumor efficacy, leading to an 80% inhibition of tumor growth
with prolonged survival compared with Hsp90 inhibitor monotherapy. Together, our findings indicate that
Hsp90 inhibitor–induced activation of the heat shock response and CLU is attenuated by OGX-011, with
synergistic effects on delaying CRPC progression. Cancer Res; 71(17); 5838–49. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the third
most common cause of cancer-related mortality in men in the
United States (1). Androgen ablation remains the standard
effective therapy for patients with advanced prostate cancer,
inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells
(2). Unfortunately, after short-term remissions, surviving
tumor cells recur with castrate-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC) and death usually within 3 years in most men (3).
CRPC progression results from mechanisms attributed to
reactivation of androgen receptor axis (4), alternative mito-

genic growth factor pathways (5, 6), and stress-induced prosurvival gene (7, 8) and cytoprotective chaperone networks (9,
10). To significantly improve survival in men with prostate
cancer, new therapeutic strategies to inhibit the appearance of
this phenotype must be developed.
Hsp90 is an ATPase-dependent molecular chaperone
required for protein folding, maturation, and conformational
stabilization of many "client" proteins (11, 12). It interacts with
several proteins involved in CRPC, including growth factor
receptors, cell-cycle regulators, and signaling kinases such as
Akt, androgen receptor (AR), or Raf-1 (13, 14). Tumor cells
express higher Hsp90 levels than benign cells (12, 15), and
Hsp90 inhibition has emerged as an exciting target in CRPC
and other cancers. Many Hsp90 inhibitors were developed
targeting its ATP-binding pocket, including natural compounds such as geldanamycin and its analogue 17-allylamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG) or synthetic
compounds including PF-04928473. These agents inhibit
Hsp90 function and induce apoptosis in preclinical studies
of colon, breast, prostate, and other cancers (12, 16). Although
promising, treatment resistance emerges early due to compensatory mechanisms involving activation of the heat shock
factor HSF-1. Once released from Hsp90, HSF-1 translocates to
the nucleus, binds to heat shock elements (HSE) of Hsp genes,
and increases Hsp transcription activity (13). Therefore, Hsp90

Clusterin Inhibition Potentiates Hsp90 Inhibitor Activity

inhibition induces a heat shock response with increased
expression of several Hsps including Hsp70, Hsp27, and clusterin (CLU). The upregulation of these molecular chaperones
has been reported to play a role in cellular recovery from stress
by restoring protein homeostasis, promoting thermotolerance, cell survival, and treatment resistance (14, 17).
CLU is a stress-induced cytoprotective chaperone that
inhibits protein aggregation in a manner analogous to small
HSPs, and its promoter contains a 14-bp element recognized
by the transcription factor HSF-1 (18). In human prostate
cancer, CLU levels are low in Gleason grade 3 untreated
hormone-naive tissues but increase with higher Gleason score
(19) and within weeks after androgen deprivation (20). CLU
expression correlates with loss of the tumor suppressor gene
Nkx3.1 during the initial stages of prostate tumorigenesis in
Nkx3.1 knockout mice (21). Experimental and clinical studies
associate CLU with development of treatment resistance,
where CLU suppresses treatment-induced cell death in
response to androgen withdrawal, chemotherapy, or radiation
(10, 20, 22, 23). Overexpression of CLU in human prostate
LNCaP cells accelerates progression after hormone therapy or
chemotherapy (10, 22), identifying CLU as an antiapoptotic
gene upregulated by treatment stress that confers therapeutic
resistance. OGX-011 is a second-generation phosphorothioate
antisense oligonucleotide currently in late-stage clinical development that potently inhibits CLU expression and enhances
the efficacy of anticancer therapies in various human cancers
including prostate cancer (17, 24). Although targeting CLU
synergistically enhances the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy, a role for CLU has not been characterized in the context of
Hsp90 inhibitor treatment and resistance.
We hypothesized that Hsp90 inhibition induces a heat
shock response with increased HSF-1 activity and CLU expression, which functions to inhibit treatment-induced apoptosis
and enhance emergence of treatment resistance. It follows
that knockdown of CLU with OGX-011 will potentiate the
effect of Hsp90 inhibitors in CRPC.

Materials and Methods
Tumor cell lines and reagents
The human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 was purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection [(ATCC), 2008,
ATCC authentication by isoenzyme analysis] and maintained
in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; InvitrogenLife Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% FBS and 2
mmol/L L-glutamine. LNCaP cells were kindly provided by Dr.
Leland W.K. Chung (1992, MD Anderson Cancer Center,
Houston, TX) and tested and authenticated by whole-genome
and whole-transcriptome sequencing on an Illumina Genome
Analyzer IIx platform in July 2009. LNCaP cells were maintained RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% FBS and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. All cell lines
were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2/air atmosphere at 37 C.
All cell lines were passaged for less than 3 months after
resurrection. Western blotting and/or real-time PCR was
carried out for AR and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) each
time when LNCaP cells were resurrected.

Therapeutic agents
Hsp90 inhibitor, PF-04928473 [4-(6,6-dimethyl-4-oxo-3-trifluoromethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-indazol-1-yl)-2-(4-hydroxycyclohexylamino)-benzamide] and its prodrug PF-04929113
were kindly provided by Pfizer and used for in vitro and in vivo
studies, respectively. These compounds are novel, synthetic,
small-molecular-weight inhibitors that bind the N-terminal
adenosine triphosphate binding site of Hsp90, and PF04929113 is orally bioavailable. For the in vitro studies, PF04928473 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 10
mmol/L stock solutions and stored at 20 C. For the in vivo
studies, PF-04929113 was dissolved in PBS containing 0.5%
carboxymethylcellulose and 0.5% Tween 80 (Invitrogen-Life
Technologies, Inc.) at 15 mg/mL and stored at 4 C.
17-AAG was kindly provided by NIH and used for in vitro
and in vivo studies. For the studies, 17-AAG was dissolved in
DMSO at 10 mmol/L stock solutions and stored at 20 C.
CLU siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides
siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc.,
using the siRNA sequence corresponding to the human CLU
initiation site in exon 2 and a scramble control as previously
described (25). Second-generation antisense (OGX-011) and
scrambled (ScrB) oligonucleotides with a 20 -O-(2-methoxy)
ethyl modification were supplied by OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals. OGX-011 sequence (50 -CAGCAGCAGAGTCTTCATCAT30 ) corresponds to the initiation site in exon II of human CLU.
The ScrB control sequence was 50 -CAGCGCTGACAACAGTTTCAT-30 . Prostate cells were treated with siRNA or
oligonucleotides, using protocols described previously (25).
Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays
Prostate cancer cells lines were plated in appropriate media
(DMEM or RPMI) with 5% FBS and treated with PF-04928473
or 17-AAG at indicated concentration and time and cell
growth was measured using the crystal violet assay as
described previously (26). Detection and quantitation of apoptotic cells were done by flow cytometry (described later) and
Western blot analysis. Each assay was repeated in triplicate.
The combination index (CI) was evaluated using CalcuSyn
dose–effect analysis software (Biosoft). This method, based on
the multiple drug effect equation of Chou–Talalay (27), is
suitable for calculating combined drug activity over a wide
range of growth inhibition: CI ¼ 1, additivity; CI > 1, antagonism; CI < 1, synergism. CI was calculated at ED50 and ED75.
Caspase-3 activity was assessed 3 days after treatment with
the CaspACE Assay System, Fluorometric (Promega). Incubation of 50 mg of total cell lysate was done with the caspase-3
substrate AC-DEVD-AMC at room temperature for 4 hours,
and caspase-3 activity was quantified in a fluorometer with
excitation and emission at 360 and at 460 nm, respectively.
Cell-cycle analysis
Prostate cancer cell lines were incubated in the absence or
presence of 1 mmol/L PF-04928473 or 17-AAG for 72 hours,
trypsinized, washed twice, and incubated in PBS containing
0.12% Triton X-100, 0.12 mmol/L EDTA, and 100 mg/mL
ribonuclease A; 50 mg/mL propidium iodide was then added

to each sample for 20 minutes at 4 C. Cell-cycle distribution
was analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter Epics Elite;
Beckman, Inc.), based on 2N and 4N DNA content. Each assay
was done in triplicate.
Western blot analysis
Samples containing equal amounts of protein (depending
on the antibody, 5–50 mg) from lysates of cultured tumor
prostate cell lines underwent SDS-PAGE and were transferred
to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked in Odyssey
Blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) at room temperature for
1 hour, and blots were probed overnight at 4 C with primary
antibodies (Supplementary Materials) to detect proteins of
interest. After incubation, the filters were washed 3 times with
washing buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Tween) for 5 minutes.
Filters were then incubated for 1 hour with 1:5,000 diluted
Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) at room temperature. Specific proteins were detected using Odyssey IR
imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences) after washing.
Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells after 48 hours
of treatment using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Inc.). Two micrograms of total RNA was reversed
transcribed using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Applied Science). Real-time monitoring of PCR
amplification of cDNA was done using DNA primers (Supplementary Table S1) on the ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence
Detection System (applied Biosystems) with SYBR PCR Master
Mix (Applied Biosystems). Target gene expression was
normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) levels in respective samples as an internal standard,
and the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method was used to
calculated relative quantification of target mRNAs. Each assay
was carried out in triplicate.
Luciferase assay
LNCaP and C4-2 cells (2.5  105) were plated on 6-well
plates and transfected using lipofectin (6 mL per well; Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Inc.). The total amount of HSE plasmid
DNA used was normalized to 1 mg per well by the addition of a
control plasmid. PF-04928473 or 17-AAG (1 mmol/L) was
added 4 hours after the transfection for a total of 48 hours.
HSE-luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) with the aid of a
microplate luminometer (EG&G Berthold). All experiments
were carried out in triplicate wells and repeated 3 times using
different preparations of plasmids.
Immunofluorescence
Tumor cells were grown on coverslips and treated with
different concentration of PF-04928473 or 17-AAG for 48
hours. After treatment, cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol
completed with 3% acetone for 10 minutes at 20 C. Cells
were then washed thrice with PBS and incubated with 0.2%
Triton/PBS for 10 minutes, followed by washing and 30
minutes of blocking in 3% nonfat milk before the addition
of antibody overnight to detect HSF-1 (1:250). Antigens were

visualized using anti-mouse antibody coupled with fluorescein
isothiocyanate (1:500; 30 minutes). Photomicrographs were
taken at 20 magnification with a Zeiss Axioplan II fluorescence microscope, followed by analysis with imaging software
(Northern Eclipse; Empix Imaging, Inc.).
Animal treatment
Male athymic nude mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc.)
were injected subcutaneously with 2  106 LNCaP cells
(suspended in 0.1 mL Matrigel; BD Biosciences). The mice
were castrated once tumors reach between 300 and 500 mm3
or the PSA level increased above 50 ng/mL. Once tumors
progressed to castrate resistance, mice were randomly
assigned to vehicle, PF-04929113 alone, PF-04929113 þ ScrB
ASO, or PF-04929113 þ OGX-011. PF-04929113 (prodrug, 25
mg/kg; formulation in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose þ 0.5%
Tween 80) is orally administered 3 times per week, and OGX011 or ScrB ASO (15 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally
once daily for the first week and then 3 times per week. Each
experimental group consisted of 10 mice. Tumor volume was
measured twice weekly (length  width  depth  0.5432).
Serum PSA level was determined weekly by enzymatic immunoassay (Abbott IMX). PSA doubling time (PSA dt) and
velocity were calculated by the log-slope method (PSAt ¼
PSAinitial  emt). Data points were expressed as average tumor
volume  SEM or average PSA concentration  SEM.
To establish PC-3 tumors, 2  106 PC-3 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in the flank region of 6- to 8-week-old
male athymic mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc.). When
tumors reached 100 mm3, usually 3 to 4 weeks after injection,
mice were randomly selected for treatment with 17-AAG (25
mg/kg) þ control ScrB ASO (15 mg/kg) or 17AAG þ OGX-011
(15 mg/kg). 17-AAG was injected intraperitoneally 3 times per
week, and OGX-011 or ScrB was injected intraperitoneally
once per day for the first week and then 3 times per week. Each
experimental group consisted of 7 mice. Tumor volume was
measured twice weekly. Data points were expressed as average
tumor volume  SEM.
When tumor volume reached 10% or more of body weight,
mice were sacrificed and tumors were harvested for evaluation of protein expression by Western blot analyses and
immunohistochemistry. All animal procedures were carried
out according to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on
Animal Care and appropriate institutional certification.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining was done on formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded 4-mm sections of tumor samples, using
adequate primary antibody (Supplementary Materials) and
the Ventana autostainer Discover XT (Ventana Medical
System) with enzyme-labeled biotin streptavidin system
and solvent-resistant 3,30 -diaminobenyidine map kit. All
comparisons of staining intensities were made at 200
magnifications.
Statistical analysis
All in vitro data were assessed using the Student t test
and the Mann–Whitney test. Tumor volumes of mice were

(28). mRNA levels of CLU, Hsp70, and Hsp90 also increased
after Hsp90 inhibitor treatment (Fig. 1D).
Next, we assessed the effects of PF-04928473 treatment on
CLU expression in vivo in CRPC LNCaP xenografts by
immunohistochemistry and Western blot (Fig. 2). CLU
expression increased 4-fold after treatment with PF04929113 (***, P < 0.001) compared with vehicle-treated
tumor (Fig. 2A and B). Similarly, Hsp70, considered a pharmacodynamic measure of Hsp90 inhibition (16, 29),
increased 2.3-fold after treatment with PF-04929113 (***,

analyzed using Kaplan–Meier curves, and statistical significance between the groups was assessed with the log-rank test
(GraphPad Prism). Levels of statistical significance were set at
P < 0.05.

Results
Hsp90 inhibitors induce expression of HSPs in prostate
cancer cells in vitro and in vivo
Dose- and time-dependent effects of 17-AAG or PF04928473 on the expression of CLU, Hsp90, Hsp70, and Akt
protein and mRNA levels were evaluated in LNCaP and PC-3
cells. Both 17-AAG and PF-04928473 increased Hsp70 and CLU
protein levels 3-fold in a dose- and time-dependent manner
(Fig. 1A–C). Hsp90 inhibition induced a dose- and timedependent decline of Akt expression as previously reported

expected, 17-AAG or PF-04928473 significantly induced CLU
(Fig. 1) and HSF-1 activity in a dose-dependent manner (***,
P  0.001; Fig. 3A). CLU overexpression protected PC-3
tumor cells from PF-04928473–induced apoptosis (**, P 

using siRNA decreases CLU expression, sensitizing tumor
cells to apoptosis induced by PF-04928473 (Supplementary
Fig. S1B), confirming that the protective effect of CLU is
mediated by HSF-1. Surprisingly, overexpression of CLU also
increased HSF-1 activity (***, P  0.001, Fig. 3B), whereas
CLU knockdown using siRNA or OGX-011 significantly
decreased HSF-1 activity (*, P  0.05; ***, P  0.001;

(Fig. 3C), and HSF-1 regulated genes such as Hsp27 and
Hsp70 (Fig. 3D). CLU knockdown also sequesters HSF-1 in
the cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. S1C), suggesting that
CLU plays a role in HSF-1 nuclear translocation and transactivation.

OGX-011 enhances Hsp90 inhibitor–induced apoptosis
in prostate cancer cell lines
Because Hsp90 inhibitors induce upregulation of CLU
and CLU functions as a mediator in treatment resistance
(17, 24, 32), we next evaluated whether CLU knockdown
potentiated the effect of Hsp90 inhibition. LNCaP cells were
treated with OGX-011 and subsequently treated with indicated concentrations of 17-AAG or PF-04928473. OGX-011
significantly enhanced 17-AAG or PF-04928473 activity,
reducing cell viability by an additional 20% at 100 and
1,000 nmol/L (*, P < 0.05) compared with cells treated with
control ScrB and Hsp90 inhibitor (Fig. 4A). To determine
whether this effect was additive or synergistic, the dosedependent effects with constant ratio design and the CI
values were calculated according to the Chou and Talalay
median effect principal (27). Figure 4B shows the dose–
response curve (combination treatment, OGX-011, or PF04928473 monotherapy) and the CI plots, indicating that
OGX-011 synergistically enhances the effect of Hsp90 inhibitor on tumor cell growth.

Moreover, OGX-011 potentiates the effect of Hsp90 inhibitor to induce apoptosis (Fig. 4C and D). Flow cytometric
analysis shows that apoptotic rates (sub-G1 fraction)
increased significantly (P < 0.001) when OGX-011 is combined
with 17-AAG (53%) or PF-04928473 (65.4%), compared with
control ScrB (4.2%), OGX-011 (17.4%), control ScrB ASO þ 17AAG (18.3%), or control ScrB þ PF-04928473 (24.8%; Fig. 4D).
Moreover, the combination of OGX-011 with 17-AAG or PF04928473 increased caspase-dependent apoptosis compared
with Hsp90 inhibitor or OGX-011 monotherapy, as shown by
cleaved PARP and caspase-3 expression (Fig. 4C). The significant increase in caspase-3 activity confirms that OGX-011
sensitizes cells to Hsp90 inhibition with increased apoptotic
rates (Fig. 4D). Reduced cell viability from combined CLU plus
Hsp90 inhibition results, in part, from decreases in p-Akt levels
in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells, as well as AR (and PSA)
expression in LNCaP cells (Fig. 4C).

after 62 days. These data show that targeting CLU with OGX011 potentiates the effects of PF-04929113 to significantly
inhibit tumor growth and prolong survival in human CRPC
xenograft models.
Consistent with in vitro findings, immunohistochemical
analysis reveals decreased CLU, Ki67, Akt, and AR expression
after treatment with combined OGX-011 þ PF-04929113
compared with other groups (Fig. 7A). The immunostaining
results were corroborated by Western blots (Fig. 7B). In
addition, tumors treated with combination OGX-011 þ PF04929113 had higher apoptosis rates than other groups as
shown by increased TUNEL staining (Fig. 7A). These data
suggest that delays in tumor progression in OGX-011 þ PF04929113–treated mice result from both reduced proliferation
rates and increased apoptosis rates.

Discussion
Development of treatment resistance is a common feature
of most malignancies and the underlying basis for most cancer
deaths. Treatment resistance evolves, in part, from selective
pressures of treatment that collectively increase the apoptotic
rheostat of cancer cells. Survival proteins upregulated after
treatment stress include antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2
protein family, survivin, and molecular chaperones such as
CLU and other HSPs (33).
Molecular chaperones help cells cope with stress-induced
protein aggregation and play prominent roles in cell signaling
and transcriptional regulatory networks. Chaperones act as
genetic buffers, stabilizing the phenotype of various cells and
organisms at times of environmental stress, and enhance

www.aacrjournals.org

Darwinian fitness of cells during cancer progression and
treatment resistance (13). Heat shock chaperones are key
components of the heat shock response, a highly conserved,
stress-activated protective mechanism also associated with
oncogenic transformation and thermotolerance (34). Chaperones are particularly important in regulating misfolded protein and endoplasmic reticular stress responses, an emerging
area of interest in treatment stress and resistance. A growing
enthusiasm for therapeutic modulation of this proteostasis
network highlights Hsps and CLU as rational targets because
of their multifunctional roles in signaling and transcriptional
networks associated with cancer progression and treatment
resistance. Cancer cells express higher levels of molecular
chaperones and pirate the protective functions of HSF-1 to
support their transformation (34). Indeed, inhibitors of Hsp90,
Hsp70, Hsp27, or CLU have all been reported to induce cancer
cell death and sensitize chemotherapy (28, 35).
Several Hsp90 inhibitors including PF-04928473 have potent
antitumor activity in various preclinical models (28, 36, 37)
and are in clinical trials (28, 38). Consistent with prior reports
(28, 39), here we report that Hsp90 inhibitors induce a stress
response with activation of the transcription factor HSF-1 and
subsequent increased levels of Hsp90 itself, Hsp70, and CLU.
This heat shock response likely enhance emergence of treatment resistance, as inhibition of transcription using actinomycin D attenuates 17-AAG–mediated Hsp70 and Hsp27
expression and potentiates the effect of 17-AAG in vitro
(39). In addition, inhibition of the stress response by silencing
HSF-1 increases the activity of Hsp90 inhibitors (40). In this
study, we set out to evaluate the role of CLU in this heat shock
response because CLU is dramatically induced by Hsp90
inhibitor treatment and CLU inhibitors are in late-stage
clinical development.

CLU is associated with many varied pathophysiologic processes including reproduction, lipid transport, complement
regulation, and apoptosis (17, 41). CLU expression is rapidly
upregulated in various tissues undergoing apoptosis, including normal and malignant prostate and breast tissues, following hormone withdrawal (2, 42). Previous studies have also
linked CLU expression with induction and progression of
many cancers, including CRPC (17). Furthermore, CLU upregulation following androgen ablation in xenograft tumor
models accelerates progression to castrate resistance and
renders cells resistant to other apoptotic stimuli, including
taxane chemotherapy (10, 43). Consistent with these accumulated findings (43), inhibition of CLU with OGX-011 synergistically enhances conventional and molecular targeted
therapies in prostate cancer preclinical models (25). Indeed,
OGX-011 is now in phase III trials, as phase II studies reported
more than 90% inhibition of CLU in human prostate cancer
tissues (44) and 7 months prolonged survival when OGX-011 is
combined with docetaxel in CRPC (45, 46).
Here, we show that Hsp90 inhibitors increase CLU levels

04928473 or 17-AAG induces CLU. As expected (39, 40), PF04928473 or 17-AAG induces HSF-1 transcriptional activity
leading to upregulation of HSP expression. Surprisingly, we
found that CLU silencing abrogates, whereas CLU overexpression enhances, Hsp90 inhibitor–induced HSF-1 transcription activity, identifying a role for CLU in the
regulation of HSF-1 and the heat shock response itself.
CLU knockdown blocks the translocation to HSF-1 to the
nucleus following treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors. This
effect of CLU on HSF-1 activity is biologically relevant
because CLU overexpression protects, whereas CLU silencing enhances, cytotoxicity of Hsp90 inhibitors. Consistent
with these in vitro results, synergistic effects were also
observed in vivo in PC-3 and LNCaP models when OGX011 was combined with Hsp90 inhibitors. Combination
OGX-011 plus Hsp90 inhibitor significantly delay CRPC
tumor growth and prolonged survival in PC-3 and LNCaP
models. Increased apoptotic rates with combined Hsp90
and CLU inhibition suggest that delayed tumor progression
resulted from enhanced treatment-induced apoptosis.
Collectively, these results highlight, for the first time, a

biologically relevant feed-forward regulation loop of CLU on
HSF-1 and the heat shock response.
In addition to the effects of CLU inhibition on the heat
shock response, observations in the castrate-sensitive, ARpositive LNCaP model highlight another possible benefit of
combined CLU and Hsp90 suppression involving AR activity.
Hsp90 inhibition is known to destabilize and degrade the AR
with decreased PSA expression (16, 47). In vivo, serum PSA
levels, as well as PSA doubling time and velocity, were significantly reduced with combination OGX-011 therapy compared with PF-04929113 monotherapy. Serum PSA level is an
established and useful AR-regulated biomarker (48) and a
valuable tool in assessing efficacy of chemotherapy. Interestingly, at the low doses of Hsp90 inhibitor used in this in vivo
study, no effect on serum PSA level was apparent. Lower PSA
levels with combination therapy correlated with lower AR
levels. This correlation between CLU inhibition and lower AR
levels may involve the regulation loop of CLU on HSF-1 and

the role of HSF-1 in regulating expression of other AR chaperones (e.g., Hsp27, Hsp70, Hsp90, FKBP5.2), and we are
actively exploring the molecular basis in ongoing experiments.
Although CLU is known to be transcriptionally activated by
HSF-1 (17), in this study, we also show that CLU exerts a feedforward loop that in turn activates HSF-1. CLU knockdown
decreases HSF-1 transcriptional activity and abrogates its
nuclear translocation, which subsequently leads to decreased
Hsp27, Hsp70, and Hsp90 expression, similar to that observed
after HSF-1 knockdown (49). Consequently, AR stability is
reduced because of lowered chaperone levels.
In addition to synergistically enhancing antitumor activity, combination therapy may also allow dose reduction
strategies to reduce toxicity that has been associated with
Hsp90 inhibitors in clinical trials. For example, 17-AAG

monotherapy inhibited LNCaP CRPC tumor progression
(28). At subtherapeutic doses of 25 mg/kg/d used in the
present study, PF-04929113 monotherapy showed marginal,
nonsignificant decreases in tumor volume and no effect on
serum PSA levels; however, significant delays in tumor
progression were seen at this lower dose when PF04929113 was combined with OGX-011, with no toxicity
observed.
In summary, this article helps define how stress
induced by Hsp90 inhibitors regulates CLU by induction
of HSF-1 activity and, in turn, how CLU regulates HSF-1
activity, cell survival, and treatment resistance. We
showed, for the first time, that CLU inhibition abrogates
the heat shock response–induced Hsp90 inhibitors. These
observations are clinically relevant because CLU inhibitors
are in phase III clinical trials and provide a framework for
building new drug combinations based on mechanismbased interventions to overcome drug resistance. The
present study supports for the first time the development
of targeted strategies employing OGX-011 in combination
with Hsp90 inhibitors to improve patient outcome in
CRPC.
