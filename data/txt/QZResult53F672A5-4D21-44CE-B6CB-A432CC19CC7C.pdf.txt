SUMMARY
We define here the activity and mechanisms of action of a small molecule lead compound for
cancer targeting. We show that the compound, BMH-21, has wide and potent antitumorigenic
activity across NCI60 cancer cell lines and represses tumor growth in vivo. BMH-21 binds GCrich sequences, which is present at high frequency in ribosomal DNA genes, and potently and
rapidly represses RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription. Strikingly, we find that BMH-21 causes
proteasome-dependent destruction of RPA194, the large catalytic subunit protein of Pol I
holocomplex, and this correlates with cancer cell killing. Our results show that Pol I activity is
under proteasome-mediated control, which reveals an unexpected therapeutic opportunity.

INTRODUCTION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Major efforts are currently invested in large-scale cancer genome sequencing projects for
identification of cancer-specific alterations and to apply this information to diagnostics,
tumor classification and therapeutic exploitation. Especially, the cancer genome mutational
analyses have pinpointed pathways that are frequently deregulated, and have highlighted key
mutational events based on which new therapeutic molecules have been successfully devised
(Stratton, 2011; Vogelstein et al., 2013). However, the application of the targeted therapies
have also revealed the robustness of the cancer cell circuitries to overcome the repression
thus inflicted and suggested that further cancer-relevant pathways or combinatory therapies
need to be identified. The cancer cell circuitries support complex cellular characteristics that
in addition to mutational events are altered by epigenetic changes and alterations in cellular

metabolic rates, and affected by the non-physiological cues that cancer cells are exposed to.
In particular, the cancer cells must meet the demand for the increase in protein synthetic
rates due their increased biosynthetic activities, high division rates and proteotoxicity that
results from protein misfolding (Luo et al., 2009; Whitesell and Lindquist, 2009). These
needs are met by increases in protein synthetic and translation rates.
Ribosome biogenesis is a unique process of the nucleolus. This is a multistep process that
entails ribosomal (r) RNA transcription, maturation of pre-rRNA transcripts, assembly of
pre-ribosomal particles, and late RNA processing (Fatica and Tollervey, 2002; Leary and
Huang, 2001). These activities are specified by distinct groups of proteins and RNA, which
participate in the key output of the nucleolus – synthesis of the 60S and 40S ribosomal
subunits. rDNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) to a long 47S rRNA precursor,
and processed through multiple steps to the 18S, 5.8S and 28S mature rRNAs (Comai, 2004;
Haag and Pikaard, 2007; Russell and Zomerdijk, 2006).

rDNA is the most highly transcribed region of the eukaryotic genome, and over 60% of total
cellular transcription results from Pol I activity. rDNA is a multicopy gene with interspersed
active and inactive gene repeats (McStay and Grummt, 2008). rRNA synthesis is controlled
by changing the rate of transcription of individual repeats, or the number of active genes
(Grummt, 2010; Russell and Zomerdijk, 2006). The latter is under epigenetic regulation and
observed during development and differentiation, whereas the former is evident during
regulation of cell growth by external signals (Grummt, 2010; McStay and Grummt, 2008).
Strikingly, the active rDNA genes are in an open chromatin conformation and nucleosomefree (Merz et al., 2008; Wittner et al., 2011). rDNA transcription is initiated by formation of
the preinitiation complex by the promoter selectivity factor, termed as SL1 and upstream
binding factor (UBF) (Comai, 2004; Haag and Pikaard 2007; Russell and Zomerdijk, 2006).
UBF association with rDNA facilitates DNA bending to nucleosome-like structures and
recruits the Pol I holocomplex (Sanij and Hannan, 2009). The Pol I holocomplex is
composed of 14 subunits in eukaryotes, of which two are unique, five share limited
sequence conservation with RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and the rest are shared between
RNA polymerases I, II and III (Kuhn et al., 2007; Lane et al., 2011). Pol I occupies rDNA at
high density. In yeast, Pol I complex is present at ~100 bp intervals throughout most of the
rDNA. Topologically, the rDNA transcription may take place around a centrally located
initiation core surrounded by a helical cylinder of the elongating Pol I complexes (Denissov
et al., 2011). Hence, destabilization of the rDNA helix, or loss of the protein framework, will
effectively stall transcription. Interaction between RPA194 and RPA135, the two largest
proteins in Pol I complex, is considered highly stable, and RPA194 forms several
holocomplexes (Lane et al., 2011).

Nucleolar activities are increased in cancer, and mutations of nucleolar and ribosomal
proteins drive tumorigenesis (Montanaro et al., 2008; Pederson, 2011; Ruggero and
Pandolfi, 2003). rRNA synthesis is commonly deregulated in cancer, by overt activation by
oncogenes, like Myc, Her2/Neu, growth factor signaling pathways, e.g. through mTOR,
ERK, Akt/PKB or loss of tumor suppressor activity, like p53, pRB, ARF, AMPK or PTEN
(Arabi et al., 2005; Budde and Grummt, 1999; Cavanaugh et al., 1995; Chan et al., 2011;
Hoppe et al., 2009; Li et al., 2011; Mayer et al., 2004; Schlosser et al., 2003; Sugimoto et
al., 2003; Zhai and Comai, 2000). In addition, the high level of rRNA synthetic activity is
reflected by increased nucleolar size and prominence in most cancer cells, indicating a
perhaps global requirement for increased ribosynthetic activity to meet their increased
protein synthesis demands. Pathological stresses that abrogate Pol I transcription lead to
rapid nucleolar reorganization characterized by segregation of nucleolar substructures
(Hernandez-Verdun, 2006), and are profound signals leading to the activation of p53
(Boulon et al., 2010; Kurki et al., 2004; Rubbi and Milner, 2003; Zhang and Lu, 2009).

Inhibition of Pol I has been minimally exploited in the clinic. Actinomycin D (ActD) is a
known Pol I inhibitor in clinical use, but has pleiotropic effects on both DNA and RNA,
causes DNA damage and is encumbered by high toxicity that limits its use (Harris, 1976).
Recently, an rRNA biosynthesis-targeting compound (CX-5461) has been described that
reduces the engagement of SL1 preinitiation complex to rDNA and conveys antitumorigenic
activity in p53-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo (Bywater et al., 2012; Drygin et al.,
2011). A recent survey of impact of chemotherapeutic drugs on rRNA biogenesis indicated
that many inhibited rRNA biosynthesis, suggesting that this activity could contribute to their
overall efficacy (Burger et al., 2010). Notably, all cause extensive DNA damage. As most
growth promoting signals converge to hyperactivate Pol I transcription, specific inhibition of
its activity presents an exceptional therapeutic opportunity (Bywater et al., 2013; Grummt,
2010).
Here we provide detailed characterization of the activity of a small molecule compound,
BMH-21 that we discovered in a large-scale cell-based high-content screen (Peltonen et al.,
2010). BMH-21 is a potent activator of the p53 pathway and intercalates with DNA, but was
strikingly identified as a compound that did not activate the cellular DNA damage response,
and the mechanism whereby it elicited its activity remained unclear (Peltonen et al., 2010).
The goal of this study was to provide evidence of its antitumorigenic activity and to identify
its mechanism of action.

RESULTS
BMH-21 is a Potent Anticancer Small Molecule that Acts Independent of p53
We identified BMH-21 in a cell-based high-throughput screen of synthetic chemical
libraries using p53 transcriptional activation as readout (Peltonen et al., 2010). We subjected
BMH-21 to the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program NCI60 cancer screen
(Shoemaker, 2006). BMH-21 showed growth inhibition in a broad range of cancer cell lines
with a mean GI50 of 160 nM (Figures 1A and S1A). Further, COMPARE analysis
(Shoemaker, 2006) indicated that the BMH-21 response profile was unique (not shown).
BMH-21 had over 90-fold therapeutic window as compared to normal cell responses (Figure
1B) (Peltonen et al., 2010). Despite that BMH-21 was originally identified in a screen for
wild-type p53 activation, we observed potent growth repression also in TP53 null and
mutant cell lines (GI50 110 and 205 nM in wild-type and mutant TP53 cells, respectively,
Figure 1C). This indicated that although BMH-21 activates p53, it acts also upstream of p53
on other, potentially highly growth restrictive pathways.

Cellular growth and viability assays revealed that BMH-21 potently inhibited DNA
replication and increased cell death as shown by multiparameter flow cytometry (Figures
1D, 1E and 1F). BMH-21 also demonstrated potent antitumor activity at 25 mg/kg and 50
mg/kg in a human melanoma xenograft model and reduced Ki67 proliferation index (Figure
1G). Similarly, BMH-21 significantly inhibited HCT116 colon cancer tumor growth (Figure
1H). The tumor control ratios, calculated as change of median tumor weight over the course
of treatment in the treatment group as compared to the control group were 21% and 30% for
the A375 and HCT116 xenografts, respectively. BMH-21 did not cause changes in the
weight of the mice or organ histology indicating that it is well tolerated (Figures S1B and
S1C).
BMH-21 Binds GC-Rich DNA
BMH-21 is a DNA intercalator, but lacks the common property of intercalators to cause
DNA damage (Peltonen et al., 2010). To further assess its interaction with DNA, we tested
whether it displays binding towards specific DNA sequences using random deoxynucleotide

hairpins in a fluorescent intercalator displacement (FID) assay (Tse and Boger, 2005). A
close analogue of the compound, BMH-21a1, was used in several subsequent assays as
control (Figure 2A). BMH-21 showed preferential binding to GC-rich sequences, whereas
BMH-21a1 did not (Figure 2B). BMH-21 and its analogue are distinguished by a nitrogen
group protonated at physiological pH present in the parent, but not the analogue compound.
This N-group conveys a significant difference in charge of the two molecules. To further
explore their characteristics, we performed molecular modeling of protonated BMH-21 with
a DNA hexamer using Autodock (Trott and Olson, 2010). This revealed stacking of the
heteroaromatic ring between GC-pairs and potential interaction of its N,N-dimethylamino
group with the DNA phosphate backbone (Figure 2C, left). However, BMH-21a1 adopted a
strikingly different configuration and lacked interaction with the DNA backbone (Figure 2C,
right). Comparison of the biological activities of the compounds in p53-activation assays
showed that BMH-21a1 was inactive in this regard (Figure 2D). This led us to hypothesize
that BMH-21 activity is conveyed by its interaction with the DNA backbone in GC-rich
DNA sequences.

We then sought to identify genomic DNA that is i) GC-rich, ii) the alteration of which may
impair cellular viability, and iii) which conveys activities relevant in non-genotoxic p53
activation. For this purpose, we tested the GC-content and GC-tract length of BMH-21regulated genes identified in our earlier study (Peltonen et al., 2010). There was no obvious
bias of high GC-content correlating with gene downregulation by BMH-21 (Figures S2A,
S2B, and S2C).
BMH-21 Interacts with GC-Rich rDNA
We then considered other transcriptional programs. Noting that rDNA is highly GC-rich
(68% as compared to 42% in human genome, Figure 3A), that the actively transcribed
rDNA genes are maintained in open chromatin conformation, and are considered
nucleosome free (Merz et al., 2008; Wittner et al., 2011), we predicted that rDNA and Pol I
transcription in particular could be affected by BMH-21. Using the FID assay we assessed
the binding of BMH-21 to multiple hairpin oligonucleotides derived from rDNA sequence
(Figures 3B and 3C). BMH-21 effectively bound rDNA sequences in vitro in a manner that
highly correlated with their GC-content (Figure 3C). To test whether BMH-21 binding to
rDNA affects Pol I activity, we carried out an in vitro Pol I transcription assay. BMH-21
markedly inhibited Pol I in vitro transcription similarly to ActD (Figure 3D).
BMH-21 Inhibits Potently Pol I Transcription and Causes Disintegration of the Nucleolus

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether BMH-21 affects cellular Pol I transcription, we examined its effect on
rRNA synthesis using several uridine incorporation assays and by determining short-lived 5′
external transcribed spacer (5′ETS) rRNA of the 47S pre-RNA by qPCR. Cells were treated
with BMH-21 (1 μM) for 3 hr. BMH-21 potently decreased 5-ethynyl uridine (EU)
incorporation and repressed the expression of 5′ETS rRNA (Figures 4A and 4B). We then
used rRNA metabolic labeling with 3H-uridine and found potent inhibition of the expression
of 47S rRNA transcript at IC50 60 nM (Figures 4C and 4D). Metabolic labeling followed by
chase indicated that BMH-21 blocks transcription of the rRNA precursor without affecting
rRNA maturation (Figure 4E).
A cellular hallmark of rRNA transcription block is the disruption of the nucleolar structure
and alterations in nucleolar protein localization and dynamics (Boulon et al., 2010;
Hernandez-Verdun, 2006; Pederson, 2011). In line with this we observed BMH-21-mediated
segregation of nucleolar structures and altered localization of nucleolar proteins (Figure 4F).
These included nucleolar cap formation by fibrillar center proteins upstream binding factor
(UBF) and fibrillarin (FBL), and translocation of granular component proteins

nucleophosmin (NPM) and nucleolin (NCL) to nucleoplasm, whereas their protein levels
remained unaltered (Figure 4F and 4G). Alterations in localization but not expression of
several nucleolar proteins (AATF, DDX56, nucleostemin, PES, SENP3) were similarly
observed (Figures S3A and S3B). Withdrawal of BMH-21 2 hr after its application on cells
showed that these nucleolar effects were fully reversible by 24 hr (Figure S3C). These
findings showed that BMH-21 causes profound inhibition of rRNA synthesis and leads to
the segregation of the nucleolus.
BMH-21 Causes Loss of Pol I Catalytic Subunit RPA194 and Disassembly of Pol I from
rDNA

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Pol I transcription is driven by the stochastic assembly of the preinitiation complex and Pol I
holocomplex to rDNA (Gorski et al., 2008; Hager et al., 2009). Inhibition of transcription
leads to Pol I preinitiation and holocomplex protein reorganization, but their expression is
invariable (Lane et al., 2011). We analyzed the effect of BMH-21 and ActD as control on
Pol I complex proteins. ActD caused nucleolar cap formation of RPA194, the large catalytic
subunit of Pol I holocomplex (Figure 5A). Unexpectedly, BMH-21 strongly decreased the
staining intensity of RPA194 (Figure 5A). As determined by western blotting, BMH-21
remarkably decreased RPA194 expression, and to a lesser extent, that of RPA135 (Figure
5B). However, it did not affect Pol I preinitiation complex proteins TAFI110, TIF-IA and
UBF, or Pol I holocomplex proteins RPA43 and PAF53 (Figures 5B and 5C and not shown).
Chromatin-IP (ChIP) analysis for RPA194 and RPA135 showed that their association with
rDNA was affected throughout the rDNA gene following BMH-21-treatment, and led also to
dissociation of UBF from rDNA (Figure 5D). As controls we tested whether BMH-21
affected the binding of RPA194 to genomic DNA or the binding of histone H3 to genomic
DNA and rDNA. BMH-21 had only minor effects on these (Figures S4A–S4E). These
results suggest that BMH-21-activated loss of RPA194 leads to disassembly of Pol I
holocomplex from the rDNA.
We then compared the activities of BMH-21 and BMH-21a1. BMH-21 abrogated 5fluorouridine (FUrd) incorporation whereas BMH-21a1 had no effect (Figure S4F). In
addition, BMH-21a1 did not affect nucleolar protein localizations or expression of RPA194
(Figures S4G and S4H). In addition, BMH-21a1 did not alter RPA194 engagement with
rDNA as analyzed by ChIP (Figure S4I) or affect cell viability (Figure S4J). We conclude
that BMH-21a1 represents an inactive analogue of BMH-21 and ascribe this difference to
the charge and interaction of the molecules with GC-rich DNA (Figure 2).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Experiments testing temporal changes of rRNA transcription and nucleolar integrity by
BMH-21 showed that it abrogated nascent RNA synthesis within 15 min application to cells
(Figure 5E) and led to noticeable translocation of NCL within 30 min (Figure 5F). RPA194
was initially (at 1 hr) observed in nucleolar caps, and its degradation, as measured by both
western and immunofluorescence analyses, was effected 2–3 hr after BMH-21 application
(Figures 5F, 5G and 5H). These temporal relationships suggest that inhibition of rRNA
transcription is an imminent response to BMH-21 treatment of cells, followed by
segregation of the nucleolus and loss of RPA194.
Decrease in RPA194 Correlates with Loss of Cancer Cell Survival
We observed that the effect of BMH-21 on RPA194 degradation was variable between
different cell lines. For example, RPA194 expression was pronouncedly decreased in U2OS
cells, whereas it was unaffected in RPMI-7951 cells (Figure 6A). We analyzed the effect of
BMH-21 on ten melanoma, osteosarcoma, breast, lung and colon carcinoma cell lines and
measured RPA194 expression. BMH-21 decreased RPA194 to a variable degree in the
cancer cell lines (Figure S5A). The ability of BMH-21 to cause RPA194 degradation was

independent of TP53 genetic status in the cancer cell lines and in TP53 isogenic HCT116
cells (Figures S5A and S5B). BMH-21 did not affect the expression of RPA194 in normal
fibroblasts (Figure 6B). Cell lines that were resistant to RPA194 degradation responded to
BMH-21 by nucleolar stress as shown by formation of the cap structures and NCL
translocation (Figures 6C, 6D and S5C). Accordingly, BMH-21 inhibited rRNA synthesis in
all cancer cell lines as determined by EU incorporation although the extent of inhibition
varied (Figure S5D).
To query the associations between rRNA synthesis, RPA194 degradation and cancer cell
viability we determined the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). The ability of BMH-21 to
decrease cell viability moderately associated with high basal rRNA synthetic activity (r =
−0.492; Figure S5E) and its ability to repress EU incorporation (r= 0.471; Figure 6E) in the
cancer cell lines. Strikingly, the BMH-21-mediated decrease of RPA194 showed very strong
association with reduced cancer cell viability (r = 0.882) (Figure 6F).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further address the relevance of RPA194 for cell viability, we silenced RPA194
expression using RNAi. Effective RPA194 depletion was demonstrated by western blotting
and inhibition of rRNA synthesis (Figures S5F, S5G and S5H). The depletion of RPA194 by
siRNA decreased cancer cell growth and viability (Figures 6G and 6H). These findings
suggested that the basal transcription rates and the ability of BMH-21 to repress rRNA
synthesis were associated with loss of cell viability. Moreover, the degradation of RPA194
showed striking association with the cellular outcome.
Inhibition of RPA194 Degradation does not Rescue Pol I Transcription
BMH-21 did not affect the expression RPA194 (POLR1A) transcript (Figure S6A),
excluding that the loss of RPA194 results from its decreased transcription. In accordance to
reversibility of the nucleolar stress response following washing off BMH-21 (Figure S3C),
the expression of RPA194 was regained and the cells resumed rRNA synthesis when
depleted of BMH-21 (Figure S6B and S6C). The decrease in RPA194 half-life (Figure 5H)
by BMH-21 suggested that RPA194 expression could be controlled by the ubiquitinproteasome system. Accordingly, treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors MG132 and
lactacystin led to retention of RPA194 in the nucleolar caps and decreased RPA194
degradation (Figures 7A and 7B). However, inhibition of RPA194 degradation by MG132
did not rescue rRNA transcription as shown by rRNA metabolic labeling and FUrd
incorporation experiments (Figures 7C and 7D). Attempts to assess whether stabilization of
RPA194 would desensitize the cells to BMH-21-mediated cell killing were unsuccessful due
to extensive toxicity of MG132 during long-term treatments (not shown). The findings are
consistent with that the nucleolar caps represent stalled transcription sites.

RPA194 Loss is Due to Increased Proteasome-Mediated Turnover
To address whether the degradation of RPA194 relates to its polyubiquitination, we
performed RPA194 immunoprecipitation followed by detection of conjugated ubiquitin by
western blotting. BMH-21 treatment increased polyubiquitination of RPA194 as detected by
a polyubiquitin antibody (Figure 8A). We then used an in vitro degradation assay to examine
the ubiquitin-dependence of RPA194 degradation (Williamson et al., 2009). Ubiquitin,
recombinant E1 and E2 enzymes and BMH-21-treated cellular lysate as source of E3-ligase
were mixed to assess the degradation of in vitro-translated RPA194. RPA194 was degraded
only in the presence of a fully complemented ubiquitination reaction, and the degradation
was inhibited by MG132 (Figures 8B, 8C and S7A). Furthermore, we detected slower
migrating forms of in vitro-translated RPA194 suggesting its polyubiquitination (Figure 8B).

Lastly, we assessed whether deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes were able to rescue RPA194
degradation. We ectopically expressed a nucleolar DUB (USP36) and as comparison a
nucleoplasmic DUB, HAUSP (USP7) (Endo et al., 2009). Overexpression of USP36
effectively blocked RPA194 degradation, while that of HAUSP did not (Figures 8D and 8E).
These results show that BMH-21 activates a process that leads to RPA194 degradation in an
ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner.
Intriguingly, the large subunit of RNA Pol II, Rpb1, undergoes ubiquitination and
degradation in response to stalled Pol II transcription complexes (Wilson et al., 2013).
However, Rpb1 was unaffected by BMH-21 treatment (Figure 8F). Furthermore, cell stress
that causes Rpb1 degradation, UV radiation, did not affect RPA194 expression (Figures 8G
and 8H). These findings suggest differential sensing of stalled Pol I and II complexes, and
activation of distinct degradation pathways.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To ask whether other drugs with known off-target effects on Pol I transcription have similar
activities, we analyzed their effects on RPA194. Topoisomerase I and II poisons (Burger et
al., 2010) and a recently described inhibitor of Pol I preinitiation complex formation (Drygin
et al., 2011) caused RPA194 nucleolar cap formation but did not reduce its expression
(Figures S7B, S7D and S7E) indicating that the decrease of RPA194 was selective for
BMH-21. Furthermore, all cause prominent DNA damage, which may lead to less favorable
tolerance (Figures S7C and S7E). Interestingly, ActD, which is proposed to inhibit Pol I by
GpC-binding, did not reduce RPA194 expression (Figure S7B and S7D). Moreover, a
sequential treatment of cells with ActD, followed by consequent addition of BMH-21
showed that BMH-21 was still capable of activating RPA194 degradation (Figure S7F).
Comparison of their GI50 profiles in the NCI60 dataset indicated that their therapeutic
effects were dissimilar (Figure S7G). Hence the effect of BMH-21 on Pol I is distinct from
ActD, the known Pol I targeting and GC-rich binding drug, and from those with
demonstrated off-target effects towards Pol I.

DISCUSSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Here we have studied the antitumorigenic potential of a small molecule, BMH-21, and
provide detailed evidence of its mechanism of action. We show that BMH-21 acts by
binding to GC-rich DNA, particularly to rDNA, inhibits Pol I transcription and activates
degradation of Pol I catalytic subunit RPA194. This work is fundamental in several ways. It
identifies first, antitumorigenic activity of a class of small molecules and second, a potential
cancer therapeutic target, RPA194. Third, it establishes that Pol I, through regulation of
RPA194, is controlled by the proteasome activity in human cancer cells during transcription
stress. Overall, these results provide strong support that Pol I is a rational and tractable target
for cancer therapeutics.
BMH-21 is an unconventional DNA intercalator as it does not appear to activate DNA
damage signaling. Based on the molecular modeling, the protonated BMH-21 stacks flatly
between the DNA bases, contacts DNA phosphate backbone with widening of the helix, but
lacks interactions with the DNA bases, major or minor grooves. In contrast, BMH-21a1,
devoid of the protonated N-group, lacked interaction with the DNA phosphate backbone.
Although these predictions need to be confirmed by further structural analyses, this
structural characteristic was critical for the BMH-21 biological activity. As the activity of
BMH-21 is reversible, it is unlikely that it interacts covalently with DNA or traps chromatin
remodeling or DNA unwinding enzymes in inactive states. The low toxicity in normal cells
and good tolerance in mice were promising. However, its transitioning towards clinical trials
will need further toxicological testing. In general, very few non-DNA damaging
intercalators have been recognized or explored for their cancer therapeutic potential. These

include curaxin, a small molecule that traps the FACT chromatin modeling complex during
transcription elongation (Gasparian et al., 2011), and the dual activity autophagy inhibitor
and ATM activator chloroquine (Maclean et al., 2008).
We show here that BMH-21 has binding preference to GC-rich DNA, and that it binds
rDNA in a highly GC-content dependent manner. The extremely high transcription rate of
rDNA is supported by the open chromatin conformation and nucleosome-deplete nature of
the active genes (Merz et al., 2008; Wittner et al., 2011). The high rates of transcription are
buffered by the interspersed inactive gene repeats, which protect against rDNA genetic
instability (Ide et al., 2010). This “nakedness” of active rDNA may facilitate the
intercalation of BMH-21. The GC-dependent binding of BMH-21 in vitro to the rDNA gene
does not exclude the possibility that BMH-21 binds also to other GC-rich areas in the
genomic DNA. Based on our expression analysis, BMH-21 did not cause universal
inhibition of Pol II-driven transcription (Peltonen et al., 2010) and did not affect the
expression of Rpb1, the Pol II large subunit. However, these findings do not rule out the
ability of BMH-21 to intercalate to also genomic DNA, in addition to rDNA, or that such

Deregulation of rRNA synthesis is one of the most frequent underlying features of malignant
cells. This results from overactivation of rRNA transcription rate, and is stimulated by the
most common oncogenic drivers in cancers. There is substantial evidence that many
oncogenes and signaling pathways, such as Myc, Akt, and ERK control Pol I transcription
by promoting the preinitiation complex assembly, up-regulating the levels of Pol I specific
factors and nucleolar proteins or by affecting their post-translational modifications
(Grummt, 2010). These findings suggest that their specific Pol II-driven programs need to be
matched by upregulation of Pol I. Conversely, the frequent inactivation of Pol I repressing
tumor suppressors suggest a perpetual loss of control of Pol I transcription rate in cancers.
Hence, Pol I transcription represents a key convergence point of deregulated cancer cell
activity, and addiction of cancer cells to this trait.

Pol I transcription is sensitive to extracellular cues. The loss of positive signaling
(starvation, nutrient stress) decreases transcription rates, and the polymerase remains poised
for rapid resumption. BMH-21 led to rapid and profound repression of Pol I transcription as
measured by synthesis of nascent nucleolar rRNA and the 47S rRNA precursor. The rapid
segregation of the nucleolus and delocalization of nucleolar proteins indicated that Pol I
transcription was blocked, and was akin to ActD and UV-type transcription stress-induced
changes (Andersen et al., 2005; Hernandez-Verdun, 2006; Moore et al., 2011). Given the
capabilities of many ribosomal and nucleolar proteins to support p53 functions (Kurki et al.,
2004; Zhang and Lu, 2009), these findings are fully consistent with the non-genotoxic
activation of p53 due to ribosomal stress, and the discovery of the molecule in a screen for
p53 pathway activation (Peltonen et al., 2010).
Transcription of active rDNA genes is determined by priming the assembly of the
preinitiation complex on rDNA. Pol I holocomplex proteins have been considered stable
once assembled on rDNA. We found that BMH-21 caused unexpected degradation of
RPA194. The degradation was selective to the Pol I catalytic subunit and did not involve the
linker subunit RPA43, PAF53 or the Pol I specific transcription factor TIF-IA, preinitiation
complex protein TAFI110 or UBF. RPA194 degradation was mediated by the ubiquitinproteasome system, and was marked by a decrease in RPA194 half-life, RPA194
ubiquitination in vitro and in cells, and its rescue by overexpression of USP36 and inhibition
of the proteasome activity. Concomitantly, we observed loss of RPA194 and RPA135
binding to chromatin along with that of UBF. Collectively, these results indicate that the

compound activates a process that results in ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of
RPA194.

The rapid kinetics of Pol I inhibition, which takes place before RPA194 degradation, and
inhibition of transcription by BMH-21 even when RPA194 degradation is blocked indicate
that RPA194 degradation is not the primary event that leads to transcription inhibition. We
propose that transcription inhibition results from intercalation of BMH-21 with rDNA, and
the ensuing transcription blocks. Transcription inhibition and nucleolar segregation as a
result of transcription blocks was observed in all cells, and yet, some cancer cell lines were
resistant to BMH-21 anticancer activity and retained RPA194 expression. The reasons for
the differential responses of the cancer cell lines are not clear. RPA194 degradation may
depend on cell-intrinsic factors, including expression of the UPS-components involved and
pathways that lead to their activation. The observation that higher transcription rates
moderately associated with the ability of BMH-21 to reduce cell viability and the extent at
which rRNA synthesis was inhibited suggests that RPA194 degradation may also be
initiated in the cells differentially depending on the extent of transcription blocks,
transcription rates and BMH-21 intercalation. It is possible that the inability of the cells to
bypass these transcription blocks and the ensuing RPA194 degradation are the precipitating
factors for loss of viability – and that this response may vary based on dependency of the
cells on Pol I transcription. Regardless, the degradation of the catalytic subunit and its
dissociation from rDNA enforces profound inhibition of rRNA synthesis difficult to
compensate e.g. by activation of silent rDNA genes. The pathways sensing the loss of
RPA194 need to be addressed in further studies. Cancer cell lines may have inherent
differences in their dependency of Pol I transcription also due to their translational needs.
These aspects are relevant from a therapeutic standpoint and the possible use of combination
therapies targeting multiple pathways affecting both transcription and translation.

Recently, the yeast homolog of RPA194 (Rpa190) was found to be deubiquitinated by the
yeast USP36 homolog, Ubp10, and Ubp10 was shown to be important for Rpa190 stability,
rRNA synthesis and normal growth in yeast (Richardson et al., 2012). We did not observe
RPA194 degradation by DNA damaging agents UV or IR suggesting that RPA194
degradation is not instigated by generic transcription stress or DNA damage (Moore et al.,
2011). Loss of RPA194 may reflect a ‘checkpoint’ where Pol I becomes arrested on the
rDNA and which needs to be resolved by degradation of the polymerase complex. This
resembles resolution of Pol II arrested during persisting transcription blocks (Wilson et al.,
2013). It is noteworthy that several commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, including
topoisomerase I and II poisons also inhibit Pol I due to their requisite activities for rDNA
unwinding (Burger et al., 2010; French et al., 2011). Further, 5-fluorouracil inhibits
precursor rRNA processing (Ghoshal and Jacob, 1994), suggesting that several
chemotherapeutics affect rRNA biogenesis that may contribute to their anticancer activities.
However, their uses are not monitored for their potential therapeutic activity against rRNA
biogenesis. Significantly, we observed that none of the known inhibitors of rRNA synthesis
induced RPA194 degradation suggesting that BMH-21-mediated inhibition of Pol I is
mechanistically distinct from e.g. ActD, topoisomerase poisons and the recently described
CX-compound (Drygin et al., 2011). This suggests that activation of RPA194 degradation
represents a unique mechanism to switch off Pol I.

University, Baltimore, MD). Human Pol I promoter plasmid pHrP2 was kindly provided by
Dr. I. Grummt (DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany). RPA194-HA was constructed by cloning
full-length human RPA194 in pCR-4-TOPO-RPA194 (Invitrogen) to pCMV6-AC-HA-His
vector (Origene) to yield pRPA194-HA. 12H-Benzo[g]pyrido[2,1-b]quinazoline-4carboxamide, N-[2(dimethylamino)ethyl]-12-oxo (BMH-21) was obtained from ChemDiv,
verified for purity using LC/MS mass spectrometry and 1H-NMR.
FID Assay
FID assay was conducted as in Tse and Boger, 2005. Deoxyoligonucleotide DNA hairpins
containing 8-bp stem region with random DNA sequences or human rDNA sequences
(Genbank #U13369) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. EtBr (6 μM) was added to each
well in sodium acetate buffer (35 mM NaOAc, 162.8 mM NaCl, 1.75 mM EDTA, pH 5.0),
followed by hairpin DNA (1.5 μM), and 2 μM BMH-21 in sodium acetate buffer containing
2% DMSO. For each experiment the ratio of EtBr to hairpin DNA was adjusted to 1 molar
equivalent EtBr per 2 DNA base pairs. The 0% control wells contained neither hairpin DNA
nor BMH-21, while 100% control wells contained hairpin DNA but no BMH-21. All assays
were conducted in triplicate.
Molecular Modeling

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Molecular docking of the compounds to DNA hexamer d(CGATCG)2, PDB 1Z3F was
performed with AutoDock 4.2 software (Trott and Olson, 2010) using the Lamarckian
Genetic Algorithm to find the most suitable solution or best binding position for the ligand.
The initial docking parameters consisted of 25 runs, maximum energy evaluations of 5×107,
maximum of 27,000 generations, and 50 individuals per run.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
A375 cells (1 × 107) were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, lysed, and chromatin was extracted
essentially as in Denissov et al., 2011. All buffers were supplemented with 1x protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Chromatin was sheared to 500–1000 bp. Each IP was conducted
using 100 μg DNA, 5 μg antibody, and collected using secondary antibody-coupled
Dynabeads (Invitrogen). DNA was purified with ChIP DNA Clean and Concentrator kit
(Zymo Research Corporation), and eluted to 100 μl. qPCR was conducted using 2 μl of elute
in 10 μl reaction, using a final concentration of primers at 200 nM on ABI Prism7900.
Primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
rRNA Synthesis Assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were labeled with 1 mM 5-FUrd (Sigma) using hypotonic shift and fixed with ice-cold
methanol and acetone. Cells were blocked in 3% BSA and FUrd was detected using anti-5BrdU antibody. DNA was stained with DAPI. Alternatively cells were labeled with ethynyluridine (EU) and processed according to the Click-IT protocol (Invitrogen). The analysis of
de novo synthesized rRNA was according to Pestov et al., 2008. Cells were labeled with [5,
6-3H]-uridine (Perkin Elmer) at 2–3 μCi/ml. Total RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin
RNAII Total RNA isolation kit (Macherey-Nagel). 3–5 μg of total RNA was separated on a
0.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel and total 18S rRNA was detected for loading control. RNA
was transferred to Hybond-N+ filter (Amersham) and crosslinked. The membrane was
sprayed using Enhancer (Perkin Elmer) and exposed to film.
In vitro Pol I Transcription Assay
In vitro Pol I transcription assay was conducted as in Mayer et al., 2004. The reaction
mixtures contained 500 ng of template DNA containing Pol I promoter at −347 to +385
(pHrP2/EcoRI), HeLa nuclear extract, 10 mM HEPES-KOH, (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, 10

of ATP, GTP, UTP and CTP. After incubation for 2 hr at 30°C, RNA was extracted, and the
rRNA product was amplified using PCR primers for 5′ETS rRNA located at +2 (forward),
+82 (reverse), analyzed in 8% polyacrylamide gel and stained using SYBR Gold.
RNA Interference
U2OS cells were transfected with control siRNA duplex or specific siRNAs (10 nM) using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) and incubated for 48 hr. The following siRNAs
were used: POLR1A si403, si405 and control siRNA (Ambion).

In vitro degradation of RPA194 was as in Williamson et al., 2009 with slight modifications.
Cells were treated with BMH-21 for 3 hr and extracts were prepared in SB-buffer (20 mM
HEPES pH 7.5, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors (Roche), 15
mM creatine phosphate, 2 mM ATP). Reactions were carried out in a mix containing human
recombinant E1 (32 ng/ml), UbcH5c (50 ng/ml), UbcH10 (10 ng/ml), ubiquitin (50 ng/ml),
Ub-aldehyde and supplemented with 5 mM ATP. Reactions were initiated by addition of in
vitro translated pRPA194-HA (TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System; Promega) and
incubated for 90–120 min at 30°C. MG132 was used at 85 μM when indicated.

Mouse Xenograft Studies
All mouse studies were conducted according to the animal experimentation permits of
Animal Care and Use Committee at Johns Hopkins University and the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at University of Maryland Baltimore County (MO12M141,
MO12M325 and CB010631215, respectively). Pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies are
detailed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. For tumor xenograft experiments, A375
(3×106) or HCT116 (2×106) cells were injected in 0.1 ml PBS to the flanks of 6-week old
athymic NCr nu/nu mice and the tumors were allowed to establish until they reached 90–120
mm3. Mice were randomized to respective treatment groups (mock, BMH-21 25 mg/kg and
BMH-21 50 mg/kg). Mock treatments consisted of phosphate-citrate buffer (pH 6.0).
Treatments were administered i.p. on a cycle 6 days on, one day off (A375) or daily
(HCT116). Tumor weight (TW) was calculated by measuring the tumor diameter with a
caliper and using the formula:
where L is the tumor length and W is the
tumor width. Tumor growth ratios were calculated as Δtumor weight (median) of treated
group/Δtumor weight (median) control group.
Statistical Analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Values were calculated using Student’s two-tailed T test and statistical significance of tumor
growth was assessed using Two-Way ANOVA. p values are expressed as follows; ns nonsignificant, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.

SIGNIFICANCE

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Pol I is a large transcriptional holocomplex that governs the production of ribosomal
RNA. Pol I transcription occurs at a high rate, is robust, and responds to extracellular
cues. Pol I activity is frequently deregulated in cancers by oncogene activation and/or
tumor suppressor inactivation. Despite the key importance of Pol I activity to cancer
cells, only limited efforts have been directed to its therapeutic targeting. The data
presented here identify a potent small molecule acting on a key Pol I protein component.
The findings strongly support that therapeutic exploitation of deregulated Pol I activity in
cancer is a feasible and rational approach.
