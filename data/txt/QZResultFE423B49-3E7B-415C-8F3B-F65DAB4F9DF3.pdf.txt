ABSTRACT
Tumor occurrence and development are very complicated processes. In addition
to the roles of exogenous carcinogenic factors, the body’s internal factors also
play important roles. These factors include the host response to the tumor and the
tumor effect on the host. In particular, the proliferation, migration and activation
of endothelial cells are involved in tumor angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is one of the
hallmarks of cancer. In this study, we investigate whether plumbagin can abrogate
angiogenesis-mediated tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and, if so,
through which molecular mechanisms. We observed that in co-cultures of the human
endothelial cell line EA.hy926 and the human hepatoma cell line SMMC-7721 and
Hep3B, the hepatoma cells induced migration, invasion, tube formation and viability
of the EA.hy926 cells in vitro, and these processes were inhibited by plumbagin. RealTime PCR, Western Blot and Immunofluorescence staining showed that plumbagin
treatment suppressed expression of angiogenesis pathways (PI3K-Akt, VEGF/KDR
and Angiopoietins/Tie2) and angiogenic factors (VEGF, CTGF, ET-1, bFGF),which
is associated with tumor angiogenesis in cancer cells and xenograft tumor tissues.
Furthermore, plumbagin was also found to significantly reduce tumor growth in an
orthotopic HCC mouse model and to inhibit tumor-induced angiogenesis in HCC patient
xenografts. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that plumbagin might be a
promising anti-angiogenic drug with significant antitumor activity in HCC.

endothelial cells were activated by pro-angiogenic factors,
receptor tyrosine kinases (PI3K/Akt and RAF/MEK/ERK)

considered to be ideal therapeutic targets resistant to antiangiogenic therapy. Our study was designed to determine
whether plumbagin regulates the migration and invasion of
endothelial cells, thus inhibiting the tumor vasculature.

Effect of plumbagin on the capillary-like
structure formation and cell morphology
including F-actin remodeling induced by coculture of EA.hy926 cells with SMMC-7721 cells
or Hep3B cells

Plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1, 4-napthoquinone,
PL) is a nature napthoquinone compound that is isolated from
plants including Plumbago europaea and plumbago rose.
Reports have shown that PL exerts potential health benefits,
including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial,
antifungal and anticancer properties [8]. PL is effective
against various types of cancers, especially cancer of the
hepatocellular carcinoma. Previous study demonstrated that
PL significantly decreased HepG2 cell viability in a dosedependent manner. at the same time, HepG2 cell migration
and invasion was inhibited by down-regulation of MMP-2
and uPA [9]. Additionally, PL increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio
and caspase-3/7 activity[10]. In an earlier study, plumbagin
was found to be cytotoxic against the HEPA-3B hepatoma
cell line [11]. Parimala, R’ investigations indicated PL
against hepatoma studied in rats by 3MeDAB induced
hepatoma [12]. In addition, PL not only inhibited endothelial
cell proliferation, migration and tube formation but also
anti-angiogenic effectively inhibits VEGF-A and CD31
expression and disrupts growth of ovarian cancer cells [13].
However, it remains unclear whether the PL inhibited tumorderived vascular endothelial cells migration, invasion effects
against angiogenesis. In this study, we have demonstrated
that PL could suppress tumor-derived angiogenesis both
in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, we have found that PL
could indeed attenuate endothelial cell migration, invasion,
tube formation and intratumoral microvessel density (MVD)
through the abrogation of angiogenic factors mediated PI3K/
AKT signaling pathway.

when EA.hy926 cells were cultured on matrigel
three-dimensional capillary-like tubular structures formed.
tube formation represents that of angiogenesis. We
therefore studied the effects of plumbagin on tubulogenesis
in EA.hy926 cells. Our results indicated that EA.hy926
cells can form robust tubule-like structures when seeded
on growth factor–reduced two-dimensional matrigel when
they are co-cultured with SMMC-7721 cells or Hep3B
cells. However, treatment with plumbagin leaded to a
significant dose-dependent reduction in the number and
the continuity of the EA.hy926 cell capillary-like structures
(Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 2), which suggested
that the in vitro EA.hy926 cells capillary formation was
inhibited. F-actin structure was stained by FITC–phalloidin
assay. Plumbagin (5 µM) suppressed the changes in cell
morphology and actin remodeling in the Ea.hy926 cells
that was induced by co-culturing them with SMMC-7721
cells (Figure 1E).

Effects of plumbagin on the mRNA expression of
the angiogenesis indicators VEGF-A/VEGFR-2,
ANG2/TIE2 and FLT1 in vitro
VEGF is a main regulator of angiogenesis. studies
showed that the VEGF-A/VEGFR-2/MEK1/ERK1/2
signaling pathway plays a central role in Hepatocellular
carcinoma [15]. Ang-2 bind to the Tie2 tyrosine-kinase
receptor, which was reported to promote angiogenesis
and tumor growth [16]. Thus, combined inhibition of
VEGF and Ang-2 may have complementary effects on
inhibiting HCC angiogenesis. On the basis that plumbagin
treatment was able to significantly inhibit the angiogenesis
induced in SMMC-7721 cells that were co-cultured with
EA.hy926 cells, the present study indicates that plumbagin
dose-dependently inhibits VEGF-A, VEGFR-2, ang2, and
FLT1. (Figure 2A–2E).

RESULTS
Effect of plumbagin on the migration and
invasion of EAhy926 cells induced by co-culture
with SMMC-7721 cells or Hep3B cells
In our study, the MTT assays revealed that
treatment of various concentrations (0, 1.25 2.5, or
5  µM) of plumbagin caused no signiﬁcant cytotoxicity
to the EA.hy926 cells. This concentration applied to all
subsequent experiments. Endothelial cell migration is one
of the most important and early events during the process
of angiogenesis [14]. To assess the in vitro anti-angiogenic
property of plumbagin, we examined its effects on the
chemotactic motility of endothelial cells using transwell
migration and invasion assays. When EA.hy926 cells were
co-cultured with SMMC-7721 cells or Hep3B cells, the
migration of the cells treated with plumbagin was much
less than that of the control co-culture group (co-culture of
Hep3B cells and EA.hy926 cells, co-culture of SMMC-7721
cells and EA.hy926 cells) (Figure 1A–1B, Supplementary
Figure 1A–1B). Similar results were obtained when
EA.hy926 cells treated with plumbagin were allowed to
invade the matrigel-coated polycarbonate membranes
(Figure 1A–1C and Supplementary Figure 1A–1C).

xenografted tumour in vivo

656.22 ± 45.41, 499.70 ± 80.07), respectively (Figure
3A–3D). The results revealed that endothelial cells may
play a important role as a target for angiogenesis inhibition
by plumbagin.

To evaluate the plumbagin antitumour in vivo,we
used a SMMC-7221 tumour xenograft mouse model.
Photographs confirmed that tumour formation in the
nude mice, and tumours sizes were measured using
calipers every three days until the end of experiment
to monitor the in vivo therapeutic efﬁcacy. As shown in
Figure 5A–5B.
Growth curves of xenografted tumours showed
that tumours of treatment with plumbagin observably
inhibited the primary tumor growth compared with
control group, especially at the 5 mg/kg/d dose
(P  < 0.05). (Figure 5C–5D). A slight time-dependent
increase in the RTV was observed in the groups treated
with saline (0.5 ml/d), plumbagin (1.25 mg/kg/d,
2.5 mg/kg/d, 5 mg/kg/d), and Thalidomide (200 mg/kg/d),
resulting in average RTV values of 27.42, 21.64,
17.26, 15.03 and 13.46, respectively, on day 43.
The results in Table 1 also shown that treatment with
plumbagin observably inhibited the primary tumor
growth compared with control group, especially
at the 5 mg/kg/d dose (P < 0.05). The relative TIR
obtained with plumbagin was 6.40% for 1.25 mg/kg/d,
29.29% for 2.5 mg/kg/d, and 50.94% for 5 mg/kg/d,
respectively (Table 1).

Plumbagin inhibits the activation of the PI3KAkt, VEGF/KDR, Angiopoietin/Tie2 signaling
pathways and VEGFR1/R2 in SMMC-7721 cells
co-cultured with EA.hy926 cells
To illuminate whether plumbagin was able to inhibiting
the angiogenesis induced by co-culture of EA.hy926 cells
with SMMC-7721 cells by blocking of the PI3K-Akt, VEGF/
KDR,Angiopoietin/Tie2 signaling pathways and VEGFR1/
R2 in the EA.hy926 cells, the levels of these proteins in
cells exposed to diverse concentrations of plumbagin were
detected using western blotting with antibodies specific
for the targeted proteins. As shown in (Figure 4A–4K and
Supplementary Figure 3), when the SMMC-7721 cells
were co-cultured with the EA.hy926 cells, the levels of
phosphorylation/activation of PI3K-Akt, KDR increased.
Furthermore, the expression of the above proteins in the
EA.hy926 cells was significantly downregulated in a dosedependent manner by the plumbagin treatment. These results
revealed that the overexpression of PI3K-Akt, VEGF/KDR,
Angiopoietins /Tie2 and VEGFR1/R2 may be significantly
suppressed by plumbagin treatment in vitro.

Figure 1: Plumbagin reduced the migration and invasion of the human endothelial cell line EA.hy926 that was induced
by the human hepatoma cell line Hep3B cells. (A) Plumbagin-depleted cells (24 h) were loaded for transwell migration (left)

and Matrigel invasion assays (right). (B–C) Migration or invasion were assessed at 24 h. Fields were counted for each well. The Hep3B
cells were treated with plumbagin as indicated and migration or invasion experiments were performed as in (B–C). (D) The co-cultured
hy926 cells can also spontaneously form capillary-like structures on Matrigel, and we therefore studied the effects of plumbagin on the
angiogenesis in hy926 cells. Our data showed that the number and the continuity of the capillary-like structures of the hy926 cells were
all dramatically inhibited by 1.25–5 µM plumbagin in a dose-dependent manner, which suggested that plumbagin inhibited the formation
of tubes that was induced by the hy926 cells in vitro. (E) The FITC–phalloidin staining assay was performed to examine the structure of
F-actin. Plumbagin (5 µM) suppressed the changes in cell morphology and actin remodeling induced by the co-culture with hy926 cells.
Thalidomide (25 µM) was used as the positive control, GSK690693 (10 µM) was used as the Akt inhibitor group. The data represent the
mean values of three experiments ± SE.*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to co-culture with hy926 cells.

Effect of plumbagin on tumor angiogenesis in vivo

These results indicate that plumbagin inhibits tumor
angiogenesis in vivo.

Haematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the
damaged cells. (Figure 6A, right panel lane). Compared
with the model group, there were spaces between the cells
and pyknotic nuclei in the three doses of plumbagin and
thalidomide treatment groups. As a result, the plumbagin
and thalidomide groups were found to ameliorate
the severity of the tumors. In addition, the high-dose
plumbagin treatment was the most efficacious. We
further investigated the effect of plumbagin on tumor
angiogenesis in vivo and determined the expression of
CD31. The IHC analysis showed that the positive staining
of CD31 was markedly lower in the tumors treated with
plumbagin than in the model group (Figure 6A, left
panel lane). The tumor-associated neovascularization
as indicated by MVD was quantified. The MVD was
markedly lower in the tumors treated with plumbagin
than in the model group (5.96 vs 19.15, Figure 6B).

Effect of plumbagin on tumor angiogenesis by
VEGF/KDR, ANG2/TIE2, ET-1 and CTGF
signal pathways in vivo
The two signal transduction pathways, VEGF/KDR
and ANG2/TIE2, play important roles in the process of
angiogenesis in tumor growth and metastasis. As shown in
(Figure 6C–6F) there was a marked decline in the expression
of the VEGF/KDR and Ang2 proteins in the tumor tissues
from both the plumbagin and thalidomide treatment groups
(P < 0.05). There was not a difference between high-dose
plumbagin and thalidomide treatment groups for the tumor
VEGF/KDR and ANG2/TIE2 levels. Immunofluorescence
further verified the ET-1, VEGF, and CTGF expression. The
results also demonstrated that plumbagin has an remarkable
therapeutic potential for human HCC.

5 μM), Thalidomide (25 µM) for 24 h, the mRNA expression of ang2 (A) FLT1 (B) VEGF-A (C) VEGFR-2 (D) and Tie2 (E) were analyzed
using quantitative real-time PCR. β-actin was used as an internal control. Thalidomide (25 µM) was used as the positive control. The data
represent the mean values of three experiments ± SE. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to co-culture with the hy926 cells.

DISCUSSION

Endothelial cells, which are the major components
of blood vessels, unnormal condition the angiogensis more
rapidly. VEGF is perhaps the most extensively studied
angiogenic cytokine and has successfully been developed
as a therapeutic target for the inhibition of angiogenesis in
HCC. Previous study have found tumor cell lines express
VEGF and its receptorsVEGFR1/2 have been observed
to be expressed in endothelial cells [17]. VEGF/KDR
and ANG/Tie2 two signal pathway play an important
role in the process of angiogenesis in HCC growth and
metastasis [18]. Especially, the environment of hypoxia
in HCC stimulate tumor cell to secret VEGF,which

The goal of this study was to examine whether
plumbagin could inhibit the angiogenesis mediated growth
of HCC carcinoma cells through abrogation of the PI3K/
AKT pathway in an orthotopic mouse model. Our results
suggest that plumbagin is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor and
inhibits multiple steps of angiogenesis, including endothelial
cell viability, migration, invasion, differentiation into
capillary like structures and angiogenic factors. Plumbagin
was found to exert its anti-angiogenic effects by targeting
the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade in endothelial HCC cells.

concentrations of plumbagin for 48 h. (A) Plumbagin inhibits protein expression. (B–K) The expression of p-AKT, AKT1, p-PI3K, PI3K,

activates its receptor KDR and result in endothelial cells
proliferation, migration and tubal formation [19, 20]. At
the same time, angiogenesis involve dissolution of the
vascular basal membrane, increased vascular permeability
and the degradation of extracellular matrix. We analyzed
the rate of proliferation and the viability of EA.hy926 cells
when they were co-cultured with SMMC-7721 or Hep3B
cells. Plumbagin had an ability to reduce the angiogenic
cytokine-induced proliferation of the endothelial cells to
abrogate the formation of tumor vasculature. Treatment of
the EA.hy926 cells with plumbagin effectively abrogated
the angiogenic cytokine-induced migration, invasion, and
capillary-like structures formation in vitro.
Angiogenic cytokines such as basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF), connective tissue growth factor
(CTGF), endothelia (ET-1) and angiopoietins (ANGs)
regulate tumor angiogenesis. Under physiological
conditions, Ang-2 is only weakly expressed in endothelial
cells (ECs). During tumor growth the Ang2 overexpressed

in endothelial cells [21]. ANG2 binds to TIE2 and acts
as a negative regulator of ANG1/Tie2 signaling during
angiogenesis, thereby controlling the responsiveness of
the endothelial cells to exogenous cytokines [22]. We
observed for the first time that plumbagin can significantly
suppress the production of angiogenic cytokines (VEGF,
bFGF, CTGF, and ET-1) and regulate the ANG1/2 balance
when the SMMC-7721 were co-cultured with EA.hy926
cells or in the tumors in an orthotropic HCC mouse model.
The PI3K/AKT pathway is involved in the regulation
of multiple cellular processes, including cell proliferation,
migration, invasion and survival. In many cancers this pathway
is overactive, reducing apoptosis, allowing proliferation
and thus enhanced signaling through this pathway is a
significant contributor to new blood vessel formation [23, 24].
GSK690693 was used as the Akt inhibitor is effective in
the treatment of cancer. We tested the in vivo effects of
GSK690693 in SMMC-7721 or Hep3B cells when they were
co-cultured with EA.hy926 cells that develop angiogenesis of

potential of plumbagin to inhibit tumor-induced angiogenesis

Then, MTT (1 mg/mL) (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo) was added
to the cells, and they were incubated for an additional 4
hours at 37°C. The supernatant fluid was removed, and
100 µL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma, St. Louis,
Mo) was added to each well. The absorbance (OD value)
was measured using a Multiskan MK3 micro enzymelinked immunosorbent assay reader (Thermo Scientific,
MA, USA) at a wavelength of 570 nanometers (nm).

GSK690693 (10 µM) was used as the Akt inhibitor
group. Following incubation for 24 h, the invading cells
that had migrated to the lower surface were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin, and then quantiﬁed by manual
counting. Five randomly chosen ﬁelds were analyzed for
each group.

Real-Time PCR analysis
For the co-culture with the hy926 cells, the SMMC7721 cells were collected in medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum at a ﬁnal concentration of 2 × 105 cell/mL
and incubated for 24 h in 24-well plates. Then, hy926 cells
in serum-free medium were added to the upper well of
the transwells at a ﬁnal concentration of 2 × 104 cell/mL.
Various concentrations of plumbagin (1.25, 2.5 or
5 μM), Thalidomide (25 µM) were added, and the cells
were incubated for 48 h in 24-well plates. The RNA was
isolated with TRIzol reagent (Takara, Japan) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions, and cDNA was
synthesized with Prime Script RT reagent Kit (Takara,

The EA.hy926 cells were collected in medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum at a ﬁnal concentration
of 2 × 105 cell/mL and pre-incubated for 24 h in 24-well
plates. Then, SMMC-7721 cells or Hep3B cells were plated
in the upper wells of transwell BD BioCoat™ Matrigel™
invasion chambers (pore size: 8 μm, BD Biosciences).
Serum-free medium containing various concentrations of
plumbagin (1.25, 2.5 or 5 μM) was added, and the cells were
pretreated for 48 h in 24-well plates. In a second series of
experiments, the SMMC-7721 cells or Hep3B cells were
collected in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at a
ﬁnal concentration of 2 × 105 cell/mL and pre-incubated for
24 h in 24-well plates. Then, hy926 cells were plated in the
upper well of the transwell migration inserts (pore size: 8 μm,
BD Biosciences). Serum-free medium containing various
concentrations of plumbagin (1.25, 2.5, 5 μM) was added,
and the cells were pretreated for 48 h in 24-well plates.
Thalidomide (25 µM) was used as the positive control.

Figure 7: Tumor cells secrete pro-angiogenic growth factors that bind to receptors on dormant endothelial cells (ECs),
which lead to vasodilation and an increase in vessel permeability. The ECs migrate and proliferate to form new branches from
the pre-existing vasculature by detaching from the extracellular matrix and basement membrane.

horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Boste, Wuhan, and CN). The anti-β-actin antibody was
used as an internal loading control. The antigen-antibody
complexes were visualized using the ECL system
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).

Immunofluorescence
SMMC-7721 cells were cultured on coverslips.
FITC–phalloidin was used to probe the samples for 1 h
to analyze the actin remodeling. Additional coverslips
were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies
(diluted 1:50) directed against E-cadherin and vimentin.
After the cells were washed, they were exposed to FITCconjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, M30101, L42001), and then stained
with DAPI for 20 min. The coverslips were washed and
mounted. All tissue samples were embedded in paraffin
blocks and then sectioned. Immunofluorescence staining
was performed on 6 μm paraffin sections of the tumor
tissue, which was blocked with 20% goat serum and then
incubated with anti-mouse vegf mAb 1/1000 (Abcam,
USA), anti-mouse ctgf 1/1000 (Abcam, USA) or antimouse ET-1 1/1000 (Abcam, USA) at 4°C overnight.
To detect the bound antibodies, CY3-labeled goat antirabbit IgG at 1/1000 (Abcam, USA) or FITC-labeled goat
anti-mouse at 1/200 (Abcam, USA) was used at 22°C
for 45 min. Nuclear staining was performed with DAPI
at a 1/1000 dilution (Abcam, USA) at 22°C for 10 min.
At least three sections per mouse were examined for each
immunostaining condition. Images were acquired using a
confocal microscope.

ELISA
For the co-cultures, SMMC-7721 cells at a ﬁnal
concentration of 2 × 105 cell/mL were plated in 24-well
plates in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum
and incubated for 24 h. Then, hy926 cells at a ﬁnal
concentration of 2 × 104 cell/mL in serum-free medium
were plated into the upper compartment of the transwells,
and various concentrations of plumbagin(1.25, 2.5 or
5 μM) ,Thalidomide (25 µM) were added for 48 h.
The supernatants were collected. The production of the
cytokines bFGF, CTGF, ET-1, and VEGF was analyzed
using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The absorbance (OD value) was measured using
Multiskan MK3 micro enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay reader (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) at a
wavelength of 570 nanometers (nm).

Western blotting
For the co-cultures, SMMC-7721 cells at a ﬁnal
concentration of 2 × 105 cell/mL were plated in 24-well
plates in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum
and incubated for 24 h. Then, hy926 cells at a ﬁnal
concentration of 2 × 104 cell/mL in serum-free medium
were plated into the upper compartments of the transwells,
and various concentrations of plumbagin(1.25, 2.5 or
5 μM),Thalidomide (25 µM) and GSK690693(10 µM)
were added for 48 h. The hy926 cells were then lysed
in RIPA buffer containing PMSF. The protein samples
(20 µg) were electrophoresed on 6%–12% denaturing
sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) gels and transferred to
PVDF membranes (Millipore, MA, USA). The blots were
incubated with specific primary antibodies as follows:
the p-PI3K polyclonal antibody, p-tie2 rabbit polyclonal
antibody, and KDR mouse monoclonal antibody were
purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). The AKT,
p-AKT, VEGFR2and PI3K rabbit antibodies were from
Cell Signaling Technology Corp (Beverly, MA, USA).
VEGFR1 rabbit antibodies were from Abcam (Abcam,
USA), p-vegfr1, p-VEGFR2 rabbit antibodies were
from RD (MA, and USA).The β-actin and tie2 mouse
monoclonal antibodies were from Boste (Boste, Wuhan,

Angiogenesis assay
SMMC-7721 cells were collected in medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum at a ﬁnal concentration
of 2 × 104 cell/mL and pretreated for 24 h in 24-well plates.
Matrigel was melted at 4°C overnight then added to cold
24-well plates and incubated for an additional 40 min
at 37°C. Subsequently, the supernatant was collected.
Logarithmic phase EA.hy926 cells at 6–8 × 105 to which
various concentrations of plumbagin (1.25, 2.5, 5  μM)
Thalidomide (25 µM) and GSK690693 (10 µM) had been
added were incubated for 6 h at 37°C. The capillary structures
were examined using an Olympus microscope, and statistical
analysis was performed using Image-Pro Plus software.

(2.5 × 107 SMMC-7721) were injected subcutaneously
(s.c.) into the right flanks of the mice. Two weeks later,
when the size of tumors had reached approximately
150–200 mm3, the mice were randomly divided into
5 groups (six mice/group) and treated daily for 30 d by
intraperitoneal injection with plumbagin (1.25 mg/kg/d,
2.5 mg/kg/d, or 5 mg/kg/d), saline (0.5 ml/d) or
Thalidomide (200 mg/kg/d). The tumor volumes (V) were
calculated according to the following formula: V (mm3)
=1/2 ab2 (a: relatively shorter diameter, b: relatively
longer diameter). The animals were killed after 30 days of
treatment, and their tumors were weighed and harvested
for histological analysis, immunohistochemistry (IHC)
and western blot analysis. The tumor inhibitory rate (IR)
was calculated as IR = (C−T)/C × 100%, where T is the
average tumor weight of the experimental group, and
C is the average tumor weight of the model group. The
evaluation criteria were: IR < 30% (invalid); IR ≥ 30%
and P < 0.05 (valid).

HE and immunohistochemistry
The tumor tissues were fixed in 10% formalin.
The tumors were embedded in paraffin and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The tissue sections were
deparaffinized, rehydrated and boiled in 0.01 M sodium
citrate for antigen retrieval. The endogenous peroxidase
activity was quenched. The sections were incubated with
anti-CD31 (1:50, abcam, Cambridge, MA) overnight at
4°C. The tumor sections were incubated with biotinylated
secondary antibodies and a streptavidin-biotin complex
(Zsbio, Wuhan, China). The staining was visualized using
DAB (Boster, Wuhan, China). Representative photos were
taken using an Olympus camera (Nikon Instruments, Melvil).

CONCLUSIONS
Thus, overall, our experimental findings clearly
indicated that the anti-cancer effects of plumbagin in
HCC are mediated through the mitigation of PI3K/AKT
signaling cascade and thus provide a strong rationale for
pursuing the use of plumbagin in the treatment of HCC
and other malignancies where angiogenesis is the key
contributor to disease progression. The present study
provided a basis for novel therapeutic options for the
treatment of HCC patients.
