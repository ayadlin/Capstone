Abstract

Author Manuscript

EGF-like growth factors control tumor progression, as well as evasion from the toxic effects of
chemotherapy. Accordingly, antibodies targeting the cognate receptors, such as EGFR/ErbB-1 and
the co-receptor HER2/ErbB-2, are widely used to treat cancer patients, but agents that target the
EGF-like growth factors are not available. To circumvent the existence of 11 distinct ErbB
ligands, we constructed a soluble fusion protein (hereinafter: TRAP-Fc) comprising truncated
extracellular domains of EGFR/ErbB-1 and ErbB-4. The recombinant TRAP-Fc retained high
affinity ligand binding to EGF-like growth factors and partially inhibited growth of a variety of
cultured tumor cells. Consistently, TRAP-Fc displayed an inhibitory effect in xenograft models of
human cancer, as well as synergy with chemotherapy. Additionally, TRAP-Fc inhibited invasive
growth of mammary tumor cells and reduced their metastatic seeding in the lungs of animals.
Taken together, the activities displayed by TRAP-Fc reinforce critical roles of EGF-like growth
factors in tumor progression, and they warrant further tests of TRAP-Fc in pre-clinical models.

complex initiates upon dimerization of occupied receptors, auto-phosphorylation, and
activation of various cellular processes, including proliferation and migration (Yarden and
Sliwkowski, 2001). The family includes four receptors: ErbB-1 (EGFR), which binds EGF,
transforming growth factor α (TGFα), the heparin-binding EGF like growth factor (HBEGF), amphiregulin (AR), betacellulin (BTC), epiregulin (EPR) and epigen, ErbB-2 (also
called HER2), which has no known ligand, and two neuregulin (NRG) receptors, ErbB-3
and ErbB-4. The EGF-like module of 50–60 amino acids is shared by all ErbB ligands, as it
confers specific receptor binding (Jorissen et al., 2003). The growth factors are synthesized
as type I transmembrane precursors, which comprise an EGF-like domain. Once processed,
the soluble ligand may bind and activate receptors on distant cells, neighboring cells, or on
the cells of its origin, mechanisms termed endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine, respectively
(Sporn and Todaro, 1980).

Several clinical studies indicate that overexpression of one or more EGF-like ligands
correlates with decreased patient survival. For example, in colorectal tumors enhanced
expression of TGFα is associated with over 50-fold increased risk of developing liver
metastases, and TGFα levels in liver metastases associate with poor patient outcome
(Barozzi et al., 2002; De Jong et al., 1998). Likewise, increased expression of TGFα in head
and neck tumors correlates with decreased patient survival (Grandis et al., 1998). In bladder
cancer, the elevated expression of a number of ligands is linked to decreased patient survival
(Thogersen et al., 2001). Moreover, in vivo studies have shown that overexpression of
neuregulins (NRGs) in mammary tissue accelerates adenocarcinoma development (Krane
and Leder, 1996), and favors metastatic spread of breast cancer cells (Atlas et al., 2003).
Likewise, it has recently been proposed that an autocrine loop involving NRG1 and an
activated ErbB-3 drives progression of a subset of ovarian tumors (Sheng et al., 2010).
Importantly, ErbB receptors and their ligands are also involved in resistance to endocrine
and cytotoxic therapy, as well as to radiotherapy (Bijman et al., 2009; Freeman et al., 2009).

Author Manuscript

The currently approved drugs for the treatment of tumors driven by the ErbB family are
either monoclonal antibodies directed at ErbB-1/EGFR (for example, cetuximab) or at
ErbB-2/HER2 (such as trastuzumab), or small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; for
example erlotinib) (Baselga, 2006; Britten, 2004; Weiner and Borghaei, 2006). Whereas
these agents can induce therapeutic responses in specific subsets of patients, acquired
resistance to these drugs inevitably emerges. Mechanistically, up-regulation of ErbB
receptors (Bianchi et al., 2006; Engelman et al., 2007; Karamouzis et al., 2007; Ritter et al.,
2007) and EGF family ligands have been proposed as mediators of acquired resistance
(Ishikawa et al., 2005; Valabrega et al., 2005; Wheeler et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2006). In
the same vein, human breast cancer cells selected in vivo for resistance to trastuzumab
remarkably overexpress EGFR and specific ErbB ligands (Ritter et al., 2007). Likewise,
EGFR- and ErbB-2-targeting monoclonal antibodies increase the antitumor effects of
docetaxel by blocking functional receptors and drug evasion mechanisms (Bijman et al.,
2009; Freeman et al., 2009).
Taken together, the aforementioned lines of evidence predict that drugs directly intercepting
EGF-like growth factors would likely improve response to chemotherapy and to molecular
targeted therapies. We recently described a “tailored” approach that determines which

autocrine loops are operating in a specific tumor, and then combines monoclonal antibodies
specific to the respective growth factors (Lindzen et al., 2010). Because of the multiplicity
of EGF-like ligands and the autocrine/paracrine variation displayed by human tumors, we
describe herein an alternative strategy that makes use of a tripartite soluble receptor, denoted
TRAP-Fc, comprising portions of the extracellular domains of ErbB-1/EGFR and ErbB-4.

RESULTS
Construction and expression of TRAP-His fusion proteins

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our working hypothesis assumes that by combining the ligand-binding specificities of
ErbB-1/EGFR and either ErbB-3 or ErbB-4 one would generate proteins able to sequester
the majority, or all EGF-like ligands, respectively, thereby intercept essential autocrine/
paracrine loops. As an initial step, we designed four molecular configurations by variably
combining the ligand-binding domains of ErbB-1/EGFR, namely domains I, II, III and a part
of domain IV, with the respective domains of ErbB-3 or ErbB-4 (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
The resulting construct was fused to a six-histidine tag and stably expressed in HEK-293
human kidney cells. Immunoblot analyses detected three of the four fusion proteins in the
medium of transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B), and similar analysis of cell lysates
confirmed that the TRAP-His not detected in the medium, namely TRAP-His 1–4, was
expressed but remained confined to the cytoplasm. Covalent cross-linking of radioactive
EGF or NRG1-beta to the TRAP-His molecules validated retention of ligand binding
specificities. As expected, all TRAP-His molecules, as well as IgB-1, a molecule comprising
the full-length extracellular domain of ErbB-1/EGFR fused to the Fc portion of human
immunoglobulin (Chen et al., 1996), could bind EGF, and unlabeled EGF prevented this
binding (Fig. S1C). Likewise, TRAP-His proteins 1–3 and 3-1 underwent specific crosslinking to NRG1. Binding of EGF to the TRAP-His molecules was further supported by
another experiment that assayed cellular uptake of the radioactive ligand (Fig. S1D); HeLa
cells were incubated with 125I-EGF, washed, lysed and the amount of ligand that underwent
uptake by the cells was determined. The results we obtained clearly indicated that all
secreted TRAP-His molecules decreased uptake of 125I-EGF, in line with an ability to
sequester ligands.
Construction, expression and functional tests of a TRAP-Fc protein

Author Manuscript

To enhance immunologic compatibility, we replaced the His tag with the Fc domain of
human immunoglobulin G. In addition, as ErbB-4 binds more ligands than ErbB-3 and with
higher affinity (Riese and Stern, 1998), we used the successfully secreted ErbB-4-ErbB-1
configuration in subsequent studies. The resulting structure combined a signal peptide,
flanked by domains I–III, along with a portion of domain IV of ErbB-4, followed by a
(Gly4Ser)3 linker domain, and the corresponding part of EGFR (Fig. 1A). First, we verified
secretion of TRAP-Fc from transfected HEK-293 human kidney cells. Under reducing
conditions, a single immunoreactive species was detectable in the medium (Fig. 1B). By
contrast, under non-reducing conditions a larger, major immunoreactive species was
detected, confirming that the secreted TRAP-Fc represents a disulfide linked dimer
molecule.

Using TGFα, HB-EGF and NRG1 along with the three IgB molecules that can bind ligands
(namely IgB-1, IgB-3 and IgB-4), we confirmed that the IgBs can bind the cognate ligands
with affinities similar to those of the intact receptors (Chen et al., 1996), but TRAP-Fc was
able to bind all three ligands with apparent affinities similar to or better than the respective
IgB molecules (Fig. 1C). Direct determination of binding affinities by surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) demonstrated high affinity interactions of the TRAP-Fc with ligands that
bind EGFR/ErbB-1 and ErbB-3/4 (Fig. 1D). Notably, the affinities we observed were in
agreement with previous reports (Domagala et al., 2000; Fitzpatrick et al., 1998; Jones et
al., 1999). Next, we examined the ability of TRAP-Fc to inhibit ligand-induced receptor
phosphorylation using either HeLa cells (and TGFα) or, T47D mammary cells (and NRG1).
As shown in Figures 1E and 1F, increasing concentrations of TRAP-Fc gradually reduced
ligand-induced phosphorylation levels. This observation was extended to additional EGFlike ligands from human and rodent origins (Fig. S2). Altogether, the results we obtained
confirmed the ability of TRAP-Fc to effectively sequester multiple growth factors with
efficiencies and specificities similar to those displayed by the full-length ectodomains of
ErbB-1/EGFR and ErbB-4.
The TRAP-Fc inhibits proliferation of cancer cell lines of different tissue origins

Author Manuscript

Owing to its presumed ability to sequester all known ErbB ligands, we reasoned that TRAPFc would reduce the growth of human cancer cell lines of epithelial origin, which often
maintain ErbB-mediated autocrine loops (Witsch et al., 2010). Indeed, dose-dependent
inhibition of proliferation, up to 40%, was observed when BxPC3 human pancreatic cells
were incubated with increasing concentrations of TRAP-Fc (Fig. 2A). Similar or smaller
inhibitory effects were observed with six additional cancer cell lines of mammary, prostate,
lung and pancreatic origins (Fig. 2B), but no statistically consistent inhibition of the PC3
prostate cell line was observed. Likewise, TRAP-Fc inhibited proliferation of lung (H1437),
pancreatic (BxPC3) and PC3 cells, which were exposed to exogenously added ligands (i.e.,
NRG1, HB-EGF, TGFα and EGF; Fig. 2C). Similarly, anchorage-independent growth of
H1437 lung cancer cells was dramatically decreased in the presence of TRAP-Fc (Figs. 2D
and 2E). In conclusion, the recombinant TRAP-Fc molecule we constructed can partially
inhibit growth of several carcinoma cells under both autocrine and paracrine settings.
Anti-tumorigenic activities of TRAP-Fc in animal models

Author Manuscript

The ability of TRAP-Fc to inhibit growth of a wide spectrum of cultured carcinoma cells
predicted an anti-tumorigenic activity in animals. This was assessed using human pancreatic
(BxPC3), lung (H1437) and prostate (PC3) xenograft models. Treatment with TRAP-Fc
(100 μg per mouse, twice per week) was started only after subcutaneous lesions became
palpable. Partial inhibition of all three xenograft models was induced by the decoy receptor
(Fig. 3). Moreover, two of the eight BxPC3-treated mice and two of the ten treated PC3
mice completely lost their tumors, but these cases of total regression were excluded from the
statistical analyses. It is notable that no significant weight loss was observed in these
experiments. For reference, we compared the TRAP-Fc’s inhibitory activity with that of a
combination of monoclonal antibodies to TGFα and HB-EGF, growth factors frequently
expressed by pancreatic and other tumors. As we previously reported (Lindzen et al., 2010),
treatment with the combination of antibodies partially inhibited tumorigenic growth of

BxPC3 and H1437 cells, and in the latter model the inhibitory effect of the decoy was even
greater. In conclusion, the TRAP-Fc protein is endowed with an anti-tumorigenic activity
towards several different human xenograft models.
TRAP-Fc can sensitize pancreatic tumor cells to both molecular targeted drugs and
chemotherapeutic agents

Author Manuscript

Self-produced growth factors may play essential roles in acquired resistance to chemo-and
targeted therapies (Bianchi et al., 2006; Engelman et al., 2007; Karamouzis et al., 2007;
Ritter et al., 2007). Hence, blocking such autocrine loops may re-sensitize tumors to specific
drugs. As an initial test of this scenario, we examined in vitro the combined effect on
pancreatic tumor cells of TRAP-Fc and each of the following agents: mAbs specific to
EGFR or to HER2, ErbB-specific TKIs, and gemcitabine. The results presented in Figure
4A verified the ability of the TRAP-Fc molecule to augment the inhibitory effects of the
EGFR- and HER2- targeting mAbs, namely, cetuximab and trastuzumab, respectively.
Combining TRAP-Fc with the TKIs lapatinib, CI-1033 and gefitinib, also resulted in
statistically significant additive effects.

Author Manuscript

Notably, the largest effect was observed when we combined TRAP-Fc with gemcitabine, the
mainstay single-agent drug of advanced pancreatic tumors (Mackenzie and McCollum,
2009). Hence, we addressed the effect of the combined treatment in an animal model of
pancreatic cancer. BxPC3 cells were injected subcutaneously and allowed to grow until
palpable tumors appeared. Thereafter, mice were randomized into four groups, which
received no treatment, TRAP-Fc alone (administered for the first 3 weeks only),
gemcitabine alone, or the combination. Kaplan-Meier analysis of animal survival showed
that the combined treatment led to a statistically significant prolongation of survival: the
median (95% CI) survival of the control group was 52±1.5 days (blue line). Treatment with
TRAP-Fc (black line) or gemcitabine alone (green line) moderately prolonged survival to 61
(p=0.071) and 64 (p=0.103) days, respectively, and the combination resulted in the longest
prolongation of median survival, 80 days (p=0.006) (red line). In conclusion, the TRAP-Fc
molecule exhibits anti-tumor activity when tested in animals, and this activity can be
enhanced when combined with an established chemotherapeutic agent.
TRAP-Fc inhibits invasive growth of mammary tumor cells

Author Manuscript

ErbB signaling has been implicated in invasion and metastasis of cancer cells (De Luca et
al., 2008). To test the TRAP-Fc’s effect on the ability of cancer cells to invade through
tissue barriers, we used the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line.
When plated in a natural preparation of extracellular matrix (Matrigel™), MDA-MB-231
cells tend to invade into the surrounding matrix by growing long and branched extensions
(Fig. 5A, left panel). However, when the TRAP-Fc was added to their medium, the cells
exhibited a round, non-invasive morphology (Fig. 5A, right panel). We further confirmed
the inhibitory effect of TRAP-Fc on cell migration using a dual chamber Transwell tray.
Cells were allowed to migrate through pores within a nitrocellulose filter, which separates
the chambers. Thereafter, cells that migrated and adhered to the bottom of the filter were
photographed, and the percentage of the area they covered was quantified (Fig. 5B). The

results we obtained in two different experiments indicated that migration of TRAP-Fctreated cells was inhibited by 27±7%.
The “wound closure” (scratch) assay was used to further test the TRAP-Fc’s ability to
inhibit collective cell migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. The cells were plated into two
compartments separated by an insert, resulting within 24 hours in a confluent, but split
monolayer. Thereafter, the inserts were removed, TRAP-Fc was added, and cells were
allowed to migrate. Snapshots taken after 6 hours are presented in Figure 5C. By this time,
the residual wound areas differed significantly: control cells covered approximately
71.21±0.93% of the gap area, while TRAP-Fc-treated cells covered 44.73±2.60% (Fig. 5C),
in line with an ability of TRAP-Fc to inhibit collective cell migration.
TRAP-Fc exhibits anti-metastasis activities in an animal model

Author Manuscript

To examine the effect of the TRAP-Fc on metastasis, we employed MDA-MB-231 cells,
which were initially tested in vitro using a cell proliferation assay. As expected, when
incubated with TRAP-Fc, the cells exhibited a partial growth inhibitory effect (Fig. 6A).
Hence, we transfected a TRAP-Fc-encoding plasmid into the MDA-MB-231 cells and
confirmed expression of the decoy by immunoblotting (Fig. 6B). In the next step, these cells
were implanted subcutaneously in the flanks of mice, and both TRAP-Fc concentrations and
tumor size were monitored. As expected, persistently high concentrations of tumor’s TRAPFc correlated with effective growth inhibition (Fig. 6C), which led us to examine the ability
of the ectopically expressed decoy to modulate metastasis to the lungs.

Author Manuscript

Parental and TRAP-Fc-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into the tail vein of
SCID mice, and two months later lung metastases were assessed by counting the number of
nodules. Compared to the parental cells, the TRAP-Fc-secreting MDA-MB-231 derivatives
displayed an 80% reduction in lung metastasis (Fig. 6D). This anti-metastasis effect was
verified by using a recombinant TRAP-Fc and the parental MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells were
injected into the tail vein of SCID mice, and half of the mice were additionally injected
intraperitoneally with the TRAP-Fc protein (100μg per injection) on days 0, 3, 6 and 9. Two
months later, we assessed metastasis by counting nodules in the lung. Consistent with the
results obtained with the stably expressing clones of MDA-MB-231 cells, the injected
TRAP-Fc reduced metastasis to the lung by 46% (Fig. 6E).

Author Manuscript

In summary, by using human pancreatic, lung, prostate and breast xenografts we obtained
evidence supporting the notion that sequestering multiple EGF-like ligands may bear
therapeutic significance in vivo. The therapy we propose might be especially useful in terms
of sensitizing tumors to cytotoxic regimens and delaying onset of chemoresistance. Our
results also demonstrate an anti-metastatic activity of the TRAP-Fc molecule in animals, an
observation that might be important in clinical settings.

DISCUSSION
Early studies indicated that ligand-blocking anti-receptor antibodies can sensitize tumors to
chemotherapy (Aboud-Pirak et al., 1988), a finding that was later translated to combination
therapies of colorectal cancer patients and head and neck cancer patients (Baselga, 2006).

These considerations have lead to the prediction that sequestration of growth factors would
bear therapeutic benefits. Several pre-clinical attempts to construct and employ decoy
receptors have been reported. A truncated ErbB-1/EGFR sequence fused to a human
immunoglobulin domain, designated sEGFR501.Fc, exhibited high affinity for a number of
EGFR ligands, but administration of sEGFR501.Fc to mice bearing human xenografts
resulted in weak retardation of tumor growth (Adams et al., 2009). Similarly, moderate to
high tumor-inhibitory effects have been reported by a study that separately fused to Fc the
full-length extracellular domains of ErbB-1/EGFR and ErbB-3 (Sarup et al., 2008). It is
notable that this strategy results in a mixture of ErbB-1 homodimers, ErbB-3 homodimers,
and the respective heterodimers, denoted (HER-1:HER-3)Fc.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The TRAP-Fc protein we constructed combines into a single molecular entity the binding
properties of both ErbB-1 and ErbB-4. It is notable that the spectrum of EGF-like ligands
that bind with ErbB-4 is wider than the ErbB-3’s spectrum, and, in addition, ErbB-4 binds
NRGs with higher affinity (Riese and Stern, 1998). Hence, our TRAP-Fc is expected to
exhaustively deplete all soluble growth factors of the EGF family. Notably, like
sEGFR501.Fc and (HER-1:HER-3)Fc, TRAP-Fc makes use of an Fc domain. In addition,
the TRAP-Fc molecule, in similarity to (HER-1:HER-3)Fc, makes use of two, rather than
one receptor, but unlike the full length receptors that comprise (HER-1:HER-3)Fc, truncated
forms have been used to construct both TRAP-Fc and sEGFR501.Fc. The crystal structures
of the ectodomains of both ErbB-1 and ErbB-4 suggest an inhibitory contribution of the
distal extracellular subdomain IV, as directly shown for ErbB-1/EGFR (Elleman et al.,
2001). For these and other reasons, TRAP-Fc may open new pharmacological opportunities
in terms of the challenges imposed by ligand multiplicity, tumor-specific distinct repertoires
of ligands, and the roles played by EGF family growth factors in frequent emergence of
resistance to chemotherapy.

Author Manuscript

Potentially, anti-ligand antibodies would deplete specific growth factors, in similarity to
TRAP-Fc. Although no antibody to an EGF-like molecule has so far been approved for
clinical applications, it is notable that an HB-EGF inhibitor (CRM197) is active both as a
single agent and in combination with other anticancer agents (Sanui et al., 2010; Tsujioka et
al., 2011), and bevacizumab, a therapeutic antibody used to treat colorectal and other
tumors, can intercept the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In contrast to the
VEGF family, the greater multiplicity of the EGF family ligands calls for a more general
approach, such as the “tailor made” strategy we developed (Lindzen et al., 2010). This
strategy employs combinations of monoclonal antibodies to two or more growth factors,
which are secreted by specific tumors. Side-by-side comparison of this approach and TRAPFc suggests comparable, if not superior, efficacy of TRAP-Fc (Fig. 3). However, unlike the
“tailoring” of distinct antibody combinations to specific tumors, application of the TRAP-Fc
requires no pre-determination of the identity of secreted growth factors. In addition, this
strategy may better target tumors whose spectrum of secreted ligands undergoes dynamic
changes in response to the metastatic niche, or under cellular stress conditions imposed by
irradiation or chemotherapy.
The binding constants of TRAP-Fc are comparable to those displayed by the full-length
receptors (Domagala et al., 2000; Fitzpatrick et al., 1998; Jones et al., 1999). This may

explain the in vitro growth-inhibitory activity of TRAP-Fc toward breast, lung, prostate and
pancreatic tumor cells, as well as the anti-tumor activities we observed using three xenograft
models of pancreas, lung and prostate cancer (Fig. 3). Along the same vein, wide-spectrum
ligand sequestration explains the ability of TRAP-Fc to inhibit invasive growth of tumor
cells both in vitro and in animals (Figs. 5 and 6). EGF family growth factors are considered
major mediators of epithelial cell invasion across tissue barriers. For example, a comparison
between primary lung tumors and the corresponding brain metastases showed significantly
higher expression of EGF, amphiregulin, phosphorylated EGFR and phosphorylated ErbB-3
in the metastases (Sun et al., 2009). Likewise, constitutive activation of ErbB-3 by an
autocrine NRG1 contributes to intrahepatic metastasis and to early recurrence of
hepatocellular carcinoma (Hsieh et al., 2011). Our study made use of the highly metastatic
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line and found that TRAP-Fc inhibited migration and
invasive growth, which translated to a significant reduction in lung metastasis in treated
animals.

Author Manuscript

The ability of the TRAP-Fc to collaborate with currently approved cancer drugs (Fig. 4) is
yet another indication that the decoy molecule would retard late stage tumors and reverse
resistance to chemotherapy, as well as to molecular targeted therapies. The latter (e.g.,
kinase inhibitors and anti-receptor antibodies) often elicit resistance due to up-regulation of
either alternative ErbB family members (Bianchi et al., 2006; Engelman et al., 2007;
Karamouzis et al., 2007; Ritter et al., 2007) or certain EGF family ligands (Ishikawa et al.,
2005; Valabrega et al., 2005; Wheeler et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2006). Hence, depletion of
soluble growth factors in the vicinity of heavily treated tumors and metastases may block
escape pathways and delay resistance onset. Although TRAP-Fc comprises only humanderived amino acid sequences, and the animals we treated showed no remarkable adverse
effects, more rigorous toxicology studies are mandatory for examination of the true
therapeutic potential of TRAP-Fc in clinical settings.

Expression and purification of soluble proteins
HEK-293 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with expression plasmids using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Ca). Conditioned media from drug-selected
TRAP-His expressing clones were centrifuged, filtered and imidazole (5 mM) added just
before application to a NiNTA column. The column was extensively washed (20 mM Hepes,
pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 1% Tween 20) and bound proteins eluted with 0.5 M immidazole in
saline. Conditioned media from IgB and TRAP-Fc-expressing cells were similarly applied to
a column packed with Protein A beads (2 ml). The column was washed and adsorbed
proteins eluted with 0.1 M glycine solution (pH 2.7). TRAP-Fc- expressing cells were
grown in serum free CD293 medium at 32°C.

Cross-linking with BS3
Recombinant molecules were incubated with 125I-EGF or 125I-NRG1 (each at 1.5 ng/ml) in
the presence or absence of unlabeled EGF or NRG1 (each at 3.3 mg/ml), and 2 mM BS3
(from Pierce, Rockford, IL). The cross-linking reaction was stopped after a 60 min long
incubation at 4°C, by adding glycine (50 mM).

SPR was performed on a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). Proteins
were diluted in 100 mM Na-acetate (pH 4.6) to 50μg/ml and immobilized on a CM5 sensor
chip. The protein solution was then run over the chip for 5 minutes at a rate of 10 ml/min.
The binding assay was performed by injecting the analyte solutions at 12 different
concentrations (1–100 nM) at a flow rate of 20 ml/min at 25°C. These conditions resulted in
a linear relation between protein concentration and maximal (steady-state) response,
indicating a pseudo first-order regime in relation to the immobilized ligand. The net signal
was obtained by subtracting the blank signal (dextran matrix). The association phase for
analyte binding to all ligands was followed for 4 min, and dissociation phases were
monitored for 3 min. The response was monitored as a function of time (sensorgram) at
25°C. Multi-concentration data were fit using BIAevaluation 3.2 software.

incubating overnight at room temperature. Plates were washed, blocked for 1 hour with
saline containing 1% albumin and 0.05% Tween-20, followed by a two-hour incubation with
increasing concentrations of the indicated ligands. After washing, the plates were incubated
for 2 hours with avidin-bound antibody that targeted a ligand epitope, followed by a 20minute incubation with biotin-HRP. Subsequently, the plates were incubated with ATBS
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Signals were determined using an ELISA reader (420 nm).

Cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth assays

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated in hexaplicates in 96-well plates (2,000 cells/well). Cell proliferation was
assayed after 24, 48 or 72 hours using the MTT method. To assay anchorage-independent
growth, H1437 lung cancer cells were seeded in 6-well plates (104 cells per well), within a
top layer of 0.3% agar and a bottom layer of 0.6% agar. TRAP-Fc (100 μg/ml) was added at
the beginning of the incubation. During the 14 days of incubation the dishes were checked
every day and media replenished. The assay was repeated twice in triplicates.
Determination of anti-tumor activities in animals

Author Manuscript

Female athymic NCr-nude mice (6-week old) were inoculated subcutaneously with 2×106
human cancer cells. Alternatively, MDA-MB-231 cells (2.5×106) and their derivatives were
inoculated into the mammary fat pad of CD-1-NU mice (10 weeks old). Once tumors
became palpable (5–7 days), the mice were randomized into groups and injected
intraperitoneally at the indicated time points with the recombinant proteins, chemotherapy or
various combinations. Tumor volumes were monitored twice a week, and body weights
were measured once a week. Where indicated, tumors were removed, homogenized in SBN
buffer (1 mM EDTA pH 7.5, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 1% NP-40)
and electrophoresed.
Morphogenesis assay in 3D culture

Author Manuscript

Trypsin-treated cells were re-suspended in DME/F12 medium supplemented with 4% horse
serum, insulin, cholera toxin and hydrocortisone. Eight-chambered plates (BD Biosciences)
were coated with 50 μl Matrigel™ solution (Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel from BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA) per well. MDA-MB-231 cells (2,000 per well) were mixed 1:1
with medium (4% serum) containing 25% Matrigel™ and added to chambers.
Cell migration assays
MDA-MB231 cells (1.5×105 cells per well) were plated in the upper compartment of a 24well Transwell tray (Corning, Acton, MA). Cells were allowed to migrate through the
intervening nitrocellulose membrane (8μm pore size) during 19 hours of incubation at 37°C.
The filter was removed, fixed for 15 minutes in saline containing paraformaldehyde (3%),
and cells were permeabilized in Triton-X-100 (0.05% in saline) and stained with methyl
violet. Cells growing on the upper side of the filter were scraped using cotton swabs,
whereas cells growing on the bottom side of the membrane were photographed and counted.
Wound closure assays

Author Manuscript

Wound closure assays were performed using iBidi chambers, according to the manufacture’s
protocol (iBidi, München, GmbH). Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells were trypsinized, resuspended and plated into each well (6.0 × 105 cells/well), resulting in a confluent layer
within 24 hours. Thereafter, the Culture–Insert from iBidi was removed and cells were
allowed to migrate for 6 hours.

Determination of anti-metastasis activities

Author Manuscript

MDA-MB-231 cells (1.5×105) were injected into the tail vein of female Scid c.b-17/ICR
mice (6 week old). TRAP-Fc injections were given twice a week in the first two weeks.
Sixty days later, the mice were sacrificed, their lungs removed and nodules were counted.
