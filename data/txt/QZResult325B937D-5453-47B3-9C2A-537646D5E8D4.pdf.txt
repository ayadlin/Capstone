Abstract
Classic signaling by the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) involves its binding to target cells that
express the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor a. However, an alternate signaling pathway exists in which soluble
IL-6 receptor (sIL-6Ra) can bind IL-6 and activate target cells that lack mIL-6Ra, such as endothelial cells. This
alternate pathway, also termed trans-signaling, serves as the major IL-6 signaling pathway in various pathologic
proinflammatory conditions including cancer. Here we report that sIL-6Ra is elevated in malignant ascites from
ovarian cancer patients, where it is associated with poor prognosis. IL-6 trans-signaling on endothelial cells
prevented chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, induced endothelial hyperpermeability, and increased transendothelial migration of ovarian cancer cells. Selective blockade of the MAPK pathway with ERK inhibitor PD98059
reduced IL-6/sIL-6Ra–mediated endothelial hyperpermeability. ERK activation by the IL-6/sIL-6Ra complex
increased endothelial integrity via Src kinase activation and Y685 phosphorylation of VE-cadherin. Selective
targeting of IL-6 trans-signaling in vivo reduced ascites formation and enhanced the taxane sensitivity of
intraperitoneal human ovarian tumor xenografts in mice. Collectively, our results show that increased levels
of sIL-6Ra found in ovarian cancer ascites drive IL-6 trans-signaling on endothelial cells, thereby contributing to
cancer progression. Selective blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling may offer a promising therapeutic strategy to
improve the management of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Cancer Res; 71(2); 424–34. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is one of the major immunoregulatory
cytokines present in the ovarian cancer microenvironment.
Ovarian cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages produce IL-6 (1, 2), and a high level of serum IL-6 is associated
with poor overall and progression-free survival for patients
with ovarian cancer (3, 4). IL-6 target cells express a low
affinity receptor (IL-6Ra) devoid of transducing activity on
their surface. The complex of IL-6 and IL-6Ra associates with
the signal transducing membrane protein gp130, thereby
inducing its dimerization and the initiation of signaling (5).
In the context of unfavorable prognoses, IL-6 signaling in

ovarian cancer cells can function as a regulator of tumor cell
proliferation and invasion (6, 7).
A soluble form of the cognate IL-6 receptor-a (sIL-6Ra) can
bind IL-6 with the same affinity as the membrane-bound form
(mIL-6Ra). Cells that are deficient in or that lack IL-6Ra can
respond to IL-6 when it is associated with sIL-6Ra in a process
called trans-signaling (8, 9). This is relevant for endothelial
function in vivo because endothelial cells, which play key roles
in inflammation, lack IL6-Ra expression. The endothelial cells
respond to IL-6/sIL-6a signaling with the selective induction of
chemokine production and intracellular adhesion molecule 1
expression, through which it regulates leukocyte recruitment
and promotes transition from acute to chronic inflammation
(10–12). Increasing evidence has suggested that IL-6 transsignaling serves as the major proinflammatory paradigm of IL6 signaling under various pathophysiologic conditions, such as
chronic inflammatory diseases, as well as cancers (13–15).
Malignant ascites is a distressing complication of ovarian
cancer, which may arise from both the tumor surface and the
non–cancer-bearing peritoneal surface by increasing capillary permeability and angiogenesis (16). It has become clear
that factors produced by tumor cells and that induce angiogenesis and disrupt the vascular barrier not only contribute
to ascites formation but also potentiate tumor cell intravasation, leading to widespread metastatic disease (17). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), for example, has
been identified as one of the most potent and specific
angiogenic factors involved in this process (17, 18). A
thorough understanding of the cellular and molecular

mechanisms that regulate endothelial integrity in ovarian
cancer is still lacking and would be essential for developing
novel effective therapeutic approaches.
Tumor angiogenesis plays an essential role in cancer progression and metastasis, and IL-6 has been shown to be
involved in tumor angiogenesis of ovarian cancer (19). An
increased understanding of the regulatory properties of sIL6Ra has prompted us to investigate the functional role of IL-6
trans-signaling on endothelial cells and its significance in
ovarian cancer progression. In this article, we show that
sIL-6a levels are significantly elevated in malignant ascites
from ovarian cancer patients and are associated with poor
clinical outcome. Selectively blocking IL-6 trans-signaling with
sgp130Fc reduced ascites formation and enhanced tumor
sensitivity to Taxol (paclitaxel; Bristol-Myers Squibb) in a
mouse model of intraperitoneal ovarian cancer. We further
clarified the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and cell lines
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), endothelial cell growth medium, trypsin-EDTA, and trypsin-neutralizing solutions were purchased from Clonetics. Human ovarian
cancer cell lines, SKOV-3, Caov-3, and OVCAR-3 were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection. All cell cultures were
cultured according to the suppliers’ recommendations. The
production of designer cytokine Hyper IL-6 and sgp130Fc has
been described previously (20, 21).
Preparation of ascites samples, collection of
conditioned medium, and detection of sIL-6R
concentration
Ascitic fluid was collected from patients with epithelial
ovarian cancer. The National Taiwan University Hospital
Institutional Review Board approved the project, and written
informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls
before their inclusion. Conditioned medium was collected 24
hours after 106 cells mL1 were seeded. sIL-6Ra was detected
by the ELISA kit (R&D Systems).
Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was performed with primary antibodies
for anti–phospho-STAT3, anti-PARP, anti–phospho-Src (Cell
Signaling Technology), anti-STAT3, anti-ERK, anti–phosphoERK, anti–VE-cad, anti-Src, anti-b-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti–a-tubulin (Sigma), and anti–phospho-VE-cad
(Tyr 685; ECM Biosciences). Cytoplasmic VE-cadherin protein
was prepared by the CNMCS compartmental protein extraction kit (BioChain).

examined 16 hours after Hyper IL-6 and/or Taxol were stained
with 0.5% crystal violet.
In vitro permeability assay
HUVECs (2  105) were seeded onto collagen-coated
Transwells (0.4-mm pore; Costar). After the endothelial monolayer formed, Hyper IL-6 or VEGF-A (R&D Systems) was
treated. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was added to the upper
chamber (0.1 mg/mL), and the presence of HRP in the lower
chamber after 15 minutes was determined by a colorimetric
assay with 2,20 -azino-bis-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid] (Sigma). The absorbance was read using a spectrophotometer at 405 nm.
Vascular permeability in vivo
Vascular permeability in vivo assay (Miles assay) has been
described (22). In brief, the mice received i.v. injections of 200
mL of Evans blue dye (0.5%) via the tail vein. Ten minutes later,
the mice received intradermal injections of indicated agents.
The subdermis was harvested and photographed 30 minutes
later to document any leakage of the dye into the dermal
tissue. For quantification, wheals (5 mm in diameter) were
resected and incubated in 500 mL of formamide at 37 C for 48
hours to extract the Evans blue dye. The absorbance of the
extracts was read at 630 nm in a spectrophotometer.
Transendothelial migration assay
HUVEC monolayers were formed on the collagen-coated 8mm Transwells (Costar). A complete M199 with the indicated
agents was then treated for 24 hours. SKOV-3 cells stained
with 5-mmol/L CellTracker (Invitrogen) were seeded on an
endothelial monolayer. After 16 hours, cells were fixed with 4%
ice-cold paraformaldehyde and transmigrated cells in the
lower chamber were counted.
Intravasation assay in the chick embryo metastasis
model
Intravasation was evaluated in the lower chorioallantoic
membrane (CAM; ref. 23). In short, fertilized chick eggs were
incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 C for 9 days. On
day 10, tumor cells were seeded onto the upper CAM at 1  106
cells through a 1-cm2 window cut into the eggshell. PBS or
Hyper IL-6 was applied to the upper CAM following tumor cell
seeding. Tissue samples in the lower CAM were collected, and
genomic DNA was extracted using a DNA extraction kit
(Qiagen). Specific primers for human Alu and chick GAPDH
sequences were tabulated in Supplementary Table S1.

Cytotoxicity assay
Cell survival was determined using the MTT assay (Sigma).

Immunofluorescence
HUVECs grown on coverslips were fixed immediately using
4% paraformaldehyde for 5 minutes, and processing, blocking,
and washing were performed. Staining using an anti–VEcadherin antibody (Santa Cruz) was performed. Confocal
images were obtained with a laser confocal scanning microscopy (Zeiss Inverted LSM410; Zeiss Optical Company).

Assay of chemotactic endothelial cell migration
HUVECs (105) were seeded onto 8.00-mm pore Transwell
inserts in a 24-well plate (Costar). HUVEC migration was

Statistical analysis
Progression-free survival was estimated using the KaplanMeier method. Univariate analysis of survival was done by the
log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards model was used to find
the prognostic factors affecting progression-free survival. Covariates included sIL-6Ra levels, age, stage (1–2 vs. 3–4), cell type
(serous vs. nonserous), and the presence of secondary debulking
surgery. Comparisons of the results of the sIL-6Ra levels in
clinical samples and ascites volume in animal studies were done
using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. For all other experiments,
ANOVA and Duncan's multiple range tests were used to assess
the statistical significance of the differences between groups.
Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.

Results
Soluble IL-6Ra levels are increased in malignant ascites
of ovarian cancer and are associated with poor
prognosis in advanced ovarian cancer
Although the elevated levels of IL-6 in the sera and ascites of
ovarian cancer patients have been previously described (24), the
clinical significance of sIL-6Ra levels in malignant ascites has
not been evaluated. Our first objective was to analyze sIL-6Ra
expression in malignant ovarian ascites. The clinical characteristics of these 24 ovarian cancer patients are listed in Supplementary Table S2. A remarkable increase in sIL-6Ra was
observed in malignant ovarian ascites as compared with those
in peritoneal fluid from benign ovarian tumors [Fig. 1A: median
(range), 2,645 (940–4,760) vs. 1,950 (800–2,380); P ¼ 0.0046]. To
evaluate the in vitro expression of sIL-6Ra in ovarian cancer
cells, ELISA analysis confirmed that a substantial amount of sIL6Ra was produced by most ovarian cancer cell lines growing in
culture (Fig. 1B). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
analysis of sIL-6Ra levels identified that a sIL-6Ra cutoff point of
2,455 pg/mL discriminated malignant ovarian tumors from
benign ovarian tumors well (Fig. 1C). The area under the curve
was 0.78 (0.53–0.92). The sensitivity and specificity at a sIL-6Ra
concentration of 2,455 pg/mL were 0.60 (0.39–0.79) and 1.00
(0.75–1.00), respectively. Using Cox proportional hazards model,
sIL-6Ra level (HR ¼ 1.001, 95% CI ¼ 1.0003–1.002, P ¼ 0.01) and
advanced stage (1–2 vs. 3–4; HR ¼ 24.3, 95% CI ¼ 1.3–465.9,
P ¼ 0.03) were independent factors affecting progression-free
survival. These results indicated that sIL-6Ra in the malignant
ascites of ovarian cancer may contribute to ovarian cancer
progression.

the question of whether sIL-6Ra, when added together with
IL-6 to endothelial cells, would elicit a response through transsignaling by engaging gp130. To test this, we treated HUVEC
cells with the designer cytokine Hyper IL-6 (the IL-6Ra/IL-6
complex) and examined its effects against Taxol-induced
antiangiogenesis (25). Western blot analysis evaluated the
levels of STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation, confirming the
cytokine response of endothelial cells (Fig. 2A). Similar to its
effects on tumor cell lines (data not shown), Hyper IL-6
signaling on endothelial cells increased cell viability under
cytotoxic concentrations of Taxol treatment (Fig. 2B) and
prevented cell death by apoptosis (Fig. 2C). Moreover, Taxol
dose-dependently inhibited endothelial cell migration, and
Hyper IL-6 remarkably enhanced endothelial migration and
antagonized Taxol effects on endothelial cell migration
(Fig. 2D). The IL-6 responsiveness of endothelial cells through
trans-signaling could, therefore, be involved in the tumor
progression of patients with advanced ovarian cancer.
IL-6/sIL-6a signaling induces vascular leakage and
potentiates tumor cell intravasation
To examine whether IL-6/sIL-6Ra signaling directly
induced endothelial barrier dysfunction, we performed an
in vitro permeability assay. Confluent monolayers of HUVECs
plated in transwell plates had minimal HRP flux across the
monolayer under nonstimulated conditions, whereas administration of Hyper IL-6 greatly increased HRP flux into the
lower chamber in a dose- and time-dependent manner
(Fig. 3A). Additionally, local administration of Hyper IL-6
dose-dependently increased Evans blue dye extravasation in
C57BL mice (Fig. 3B, left panel). The amount of dye extravasation caused by local administration of Hyper IL-6 or VEGF
substantially increased compared with the nontreated control
(Fig. 3B, right panel). These results suggest that IL-6/sIL-6a
signaling directly mediates vascular hyperpermeability.
Furthermore, breakdown of the vascular barrier may potentiate tumor cell intravasation and enhance metastasis. As
shown in Figure 3C, SKOV-3 invasion drastically increased
when the endothelial monolayer was activated by Hyper IL-6.
The influence on the invasive ability of the tumor cell by Hyper
IL-6 was negligible (Fig. 3C), suggesting that disruption of
endothelial barriers by Hyper IL-6 played the major role in this
process. The consequence of the increased transendothelial
migration ability of tumor cells should make them capable of
escaping from the primary tumor and entering the vasculature. The arrival of intravasated human tumor cells in the
lower CAM of tumor-bearing chick embryos was readily
observed after 24 hours in the Hyper IL-6-treated embryos,
and they continued to arrive everyday thereafter (Fig. 3D), as
assessed using the human alu PCR-based assay. In contrast,
there was no detectable intravasation until day 3 in PBStreated embryos.

VE-cadherin expression and organization at adherens junctions are crucial determinants for vascular stabilization (27).
To determine if IL-6/sIL-6a modulates VE-cadherin expression at cell–cell junctions, hence interfering with gap formation, we examined the VE-cadherin staining of HUVEC
monolayers with both confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4A) and Western blots (Fig. 4B). Compared with
vehicle control, exposure of HUVECs to Hyper IL-6 caused
redistribution of VE-cadherin from intercellular junctions,
resulting in monolayer disruption (Fig. 4A). The decrease of

Remarkably, Hyper IL-6 caused, at best, a 2.3-fold increase
in cytosolic VE-cadherin expression compared to vehicle
control (Fig. 4B). Because tyrosine phosphorylation of VEcadherin is intimately linked to VE-cadherin redistribution
and, thus, is a functional change of intercellular adhesion, we
examined the effect of Hyper IL-6 on VE-cadherin tyrosine
phosphorylation. Hyper IL-6 induced substantial phosphorylation of tyrosine 685 in VE-cadherin, which was selectively
prevented by PD98059 (Fig. 4C). Preexposure of HUVEC

monolayers to PD98059 before Hyper IL-6 exposure effectively
prevented Hyper IL-6–induced VE-cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). In contrast, AG490 and LY-294002
had no effect, suggesting that Hyper IL-6 reduced VE-cadherin
proteins at cell junctions via a MAPK-dependent pathway. In
agreement with these findings, PD98059 prevented Hyper IL6–augmented tumor transendothelial migration, whereas
AG490 and LY-294002 had no such effect (Fig. 4D).
Activation of MAPK by IL-6/sIL-6Ra phosphorylates VEcadherin via an Src-dependent pathway
An earlier study showed that VE-cadherin is a direct substrate for Src kinase and that Y685 is a unique phosphorylation
site in the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain (28). To examine
whether tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin by Hyper IL6 signaling is dependent on active Src in HUVECs, the activa-

tion of Src by Hyper IL-6 was analyzed by Western blotting. As
shown in Fig. 5A, exposure of Hyper IL-6 substantially induced
tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and VE-cadherin in HUVECs.
The inhibition of Src kinase activity by PP2 or dominantnegative (DN) forms of c-Src (K295R) substantially reduced
Hyper IL-6–induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin.
These results suggest that Src kinase is critically involved in
the Hyper IL-6–mediated dissociation of the VE-cadherin/
b-catenin complex that contributes to increased transendothelial permeability and migration of cancer cells. Considering that Hyper IL-6–induced tyrosine phosphorylation of
VE-cadherin occurs via a MAPK-dependent pathway, we
ascertained whether it was the MAPK that controlled the
Src activity in response to Hyper IL-6. As shown in Fig. 5B, we
found that PD98059 as well as the Src kinase inhibitor
PP2 inhibited the activation of Src kinases in response to

lentivirus containing dominant-negative mutants of ERK (LVDN-ERK) abrogated the Hyper-IL-6–induced Src phosphorylation, whereas transfection with LV-DN-Src did not change
the Hyper IL-6–mediated ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 5C).
These findings suggest that Hyper IL-6–mediated activation

assay. As shown in Fig. 5D and Supplementary Fig. S1,
inhibition of ERK or Src activity significantly interfered with
Hyper IL-6–induced vascular leakage in vivo.
Effects of sgp130Fc in an intraperitoneal ovarian
cancer model: inhibition of ascites formation and
potentiating of chemotherapeutic effects
Based on clinical and in vitro results, we hypothesized that
the combination of IL-6 and sIL-6Ra is present in the tumor
microenvironment and facilitates IL-6 trans-signaling, which
in turn has consequences for ovarian cancer progression. To
test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of sgp130Fc treat-

ment, which selectively inhibits IL-6 trans-signaling (29), on
the progression of intraperitoneal SKOV-3 tumors. Mice were
treated weekly with PBS or sgp130Fc (100 mg/mouse), alone or
in combination with Taxol (10 mg/kg). In all animals, i.p.
injections were initiated 14 days after SKOV-3-LG cell inoculation and continued for 4 weeks. Intraperitoneal tumor
growth was quantified weekly by an in vivo bioluminescence
imaging system. All PBS-treated animals displayed increasing
intraperitoneal tumor burden and signs of ascites formation
following SKOV-3 inoculation (Fig. 6A and C). Significant
tumor suppression by Taxol was observed 3 weeks after
initiation of treatment. The mean tumor burden in the
Taxol-treated group (2.2  109 photons/s) was reduced by
approximately 67% compared with the control group (6.7 
109 photons/s) at 42 days after injection, whereas sgp130Fc
alone only displayed modest inhibition of tumor growth
(Fig. 6A). Notably, the combination of sgp130Fc with Taxol
markedly reduced tumor burden (2.6  108 photons/s) compared with Taxol alone (P < 0.05). In the postmortem examination, tumors were found on the surface of the peritoneum,
the uterus, the mesentery, and the diaphragm in the control
group, whereas visible tumors over the diaphragm and the

(Fig. S2). We verified the in vivo effects of sgp130Fc treatment
by analyzing p-STAT3 expression of tumor biopsies by immunoblot (Fig. 6B). Additionally, treatment with single-agent
sgp130Fc substantially inhibited ascites formation compared
with the control group (P ¼ 0.02), and treatment with
sgp130Fc/Taxol combination completely inhibited measurable ascites (P ¼ 0.004 vs. sgp130Fc alone; P ¼ 0.01 vs. Taxol
alone; Fig. 6C). Therefore, we examined the effects of sgp130Fc
on tumor vasculature, which was characterized by numerous,
immature, newly formed vessels (vWFþ, a-SMA). Both
sgp130Fc and Taxol treatment led to a striking reduction in
neovascularization (Fig. 6D; Fig. S3). Tumor-associated vascular tortuosity was resolved in mice treated with sgp130Fc
with or without Taxol, indicating a role for IL-6 trans-signaling
in ovarian tumor angiogenesis.

Discussion
Chronic inflammation is considered to be one of the most
important environmental factors that participate in the neoplastic process, fostering tumor progression (30). In this article,
we showed that sIL-6Ra is present in high amounts in the
ascites of patients with ovarian cancer. Patients with ovarian
cancer who have elevated levels of sIL-6Ra at diagnosis also
have features of high-risk disease and unfavorable clinical
outcome. Finding whether the sIL-6Ra status is independent
of the current overall risk stratification system of ovarian
cancer requires further investigation. Nonetheless, the presence of sIL-6Ra renders all cells responsive to IL-6 in the
ovarian cancer tumor environment. Here, we found that
endothelial cells of the gp130þ/IL-6Ra/low phenotype respond
to the designer cytokine Hyper IL-6. The IL-6/sIL-6Ra complex

directly enhances survival/antiapoptosis of endothelial cells
exposed to Taxol and modulates endothelial barrier permeability through disrupting VE-cadherin localization at cell
junctions. The sgp130Fc effectively inhibits angiogenesis and
malignant ascites formation in vivo. The results of this study
demonstrate that IL-6 trans-signaling on endothelial cells may
regulate tumor progression and resistance to anticancer therapies, highlighting sIL-6Ra as a molecular therapeutic target for
ovarian cancer.
The generation of sIL-6Ra is complex: It can be generated
by ectodomain shedding or by translation from an alternatively spliced mRNA (8). However, the source of the sIL-6Ra in
ovarian cancer is unclear, and it is likely that there is more
than a single source involved. As shown in Fig. 1B, various
levels of sIL-6Ra production were observed among ovarian
tumor cell lines grown in cell culture, which indicates that sIL6Ra may be arising from the tumor itself. A similar observation was reported previously (19). When ovarian cancer
advances into the peritoneal cavity, the peritoneum and the
intestinal serosa may have a florid appearance similar to that
found in peritonitis (31). Endothelial cells, which lack IL-6Ra
expression, can be stimulated by IL-6/sIL-6Ra to express
various molecules by which IL-6 trans-signaling orchestrates
the transition from innate to acquired immunity (10, 11).
Interestingly, the pelvic peritoneum exhibits a general pattern
of chronic inflammation in ovarian cancer, which is represented primarily by differentiated monocytes/macrophages
and is distinct from what is observed in benign conditions
(32). Thus, it is possible that ascites sIL-6Ra levels are indicative of a systemic response to the tumor (33). Taken
together, these observations suggest that sIL-6Ra may play
a role in cross-talk between the tumor and the tumor microenvironment that supports the progression of disease.
In the case of ovarian cancer, it is not entirely clear which
cells are stimulated by the complex of IL-6 and sIL-6Ra in vivo.
However, endothelial cells would be of paramount importance
because endothelial cells play key roles in inflammation as
well as in the growth and spread of cancer (12, 34). A number
of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, such as microtubule altering agents, designed to have cytotoxic actions on tumor cells
also have antiangiogenic activities (25, 35, 36). In this respect,
our results indicate that IL-6 trans-signaling on endothelial
cells could provide antiapoptotic signals, helping endothelial
cells to escape drug-mediated destruction and, thus, decreasing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Importantly, the expression
of IL-6 and the resultant signaling cascade in ovarian cancer
cells has been associated with the development of Taxol
resistance (37, 38). These results support the detrimental
consequences of IL-6 bioactivity in ovarian cancer, and blockage of IL-6 signaling should be therapeutically beneficial for
the management of ovarian cancer.
Interendothelial junctions are important regulators of
endothelial cell functions in angiogenesis. The migration
and proliferation of endothelial cells, which represent initiating steps of angiogenesis, require the loosening of endothelial
cell–cell adhesion (39). Disruption of cell–cell adhesion in
endothelial monolayers is accompanied by increased monolayer permeability (40), leading to ascites accumulation (41).

432

Cancer Res; 71(2) January 15, 2011

In the present study, we showed that Hyper IL-6 treatment
decreases endothelial cell monolayer integrity, thus increasing
permeability to proteins and facilitating the transendothelial
migration of tumor cells. We showed that Hyper IL-6 treatment affects the organization of the adherens junction. These
effects were associated with phosphorylated Y685 in the VEcadherin cytoplasmic domain. Indeed, several agents that are
involved in angiogenesis and inflammatory processes, such as
VEGF, histamine, and PAF, have been reported to induce
tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin (42–44). The cytoplasmic domain of VE-cadherin contains 9 tyrosines that
represent potential target sites for tyrosine kinases. Although
it was not verified whether Y685 was the only phosphorylated
tyrosine in VE-cadherin after HUVEC activation with Hyper
IL-6, Src-mediated Y685 phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was
primarily responsible for the VE-cadherin phosphorylation
upon Hyper IL-6 stimulation (Fig. 5). These observations
appear consistent with earlier studies on VE-cadherin phosphorylation in response to VEGF or lipopolysaccharide stimulation that indicate Src kinase as a pivotal regulatory
protein in the disorganization of cadherin-dependent cell–
cell contacts (28, 45). However, nonreceptor Src kinase activation by the IL-6/gp80/gp130 signaling pathway has not been
described in detail. Our studies showed that Hyper IL-6–
mediated activation of ERK regulates Src phosphorylation
and endothelial integrity, suggesting an IL-6/MAPK/Src pathway in regulating endothelial activation. Supportive evidence
from a previous study showed that E-selectin–mediated activation of ERK regulates the transendothelial permeability and
migration of cancer cells by regulating the Src-dependent
dissociation of the VE-cadherin/b-catenin complex (46).
In summary, we demonstrated for the first time that, in
ascites, sIL-6Ra is an important regulator of endothelial
survival, migration, and integrity, which may contribute to
ovarian cancer progression. Our data highlight the pathogenicity of sIL-6Ra in ovarian cancer. Mounting evidence suggests
that specific targeting of IL-6 trans-signaling by sgp130Fc,
instead of a global inhibition of the entire IL-6 pathway, may
be a new treatment strategy for cancers that are accompanied
by increased IL-6 production (47). Future clinical studies are
warranted to find the effectiveness of combination selective
antagonism of IL-6 trans-signaling and chemotherapy in
ovarian cancer management.
