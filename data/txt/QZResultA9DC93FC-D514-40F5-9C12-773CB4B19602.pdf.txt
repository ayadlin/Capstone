Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is highly resistant to current chemotherapy
agents. We therefore examined the effects of triptolide (a
diterpenoid triepoxide) on pancreatic cancer growth and
local-regional tumor spread using an orthotopic model of
pancreatic cancer. We have recently shown that an increased
level of HSP70 in pancreatic cancer cells confers resistance
to apoptosis and that inhibiting HSP70 induces apoptosis in
these cells. In addition, triptolide was recently identified as
part of a small molecule screen, as a regulator of the human
heat shock response. Therefore, our aims were to examine the
effects of triptolide on (a) pancreatic cancer cells by assessing
viability and apoptosis, (b) pancreatic cancer growth and local
invasion in vivo, and (c) HSP70 levels in pancreatic cancer
cells. Incubation of PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells with
triptolide (50–200 nmol/L) significantly reduced cell viability,
but had no effect on the viability of normal pancreatic ductal
cells. Triptolide induced apoptosis (assessed by Annexin V,
caspase-3, and terminal nucleotidyl transferase–mediated
nick end labeling) and decreased HSP70 mRNA and protein
levels in both cell lines. Triptolide (0.2 mg/kg/d for 60 days)
administered in vivo decreased pancreatic cancer growth
and significantly decreased local-regional tumor spread. The
control group of mice had extensive local invasion into
adjacent organs, including the spleen, liver, kidney, and small
intestine. Triptolide causes pancreatic cancer cell death
in vitro and in vivo by induction of apoptosis and its mechanism of action is mediated via the inhibition of HSP70.
Triptolide is a potential therapeutic agent that can be used to
prevent the progression and metastases of pancreatic cancer.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive of all human
malignancies. It has an extremely low 5-year survival rate of <1%
(1, 2) and is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the
United States. The severity of this malignancy can be appreciated
by the fact that in 2005 alone, 32,180 new cases were diagnosed,
and almost the same number succumbed to the disease. Efforts
to gain information on the pathobiology of pancreatic cancer and
to elucidate the molecular mechanisms related to the tumor’s
invasion and metastases are urgently needed in order to develop
innovative and effective treatments.

Resistance to apoptosis is a key factor preventing response to
therapies in pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer cells have several
survival mechanisms that help them elude cell death. A group of
stress proteins known as the heat shock proteins (HSP) have
recently been recognized as inhibitors of apoptosis. We have shown
that HSP70 mRNA levels are significantly higher in human
pancreatic tumor tissue compared with normal tissue from the
same patients (3), and Ogata et al. (4) have shown that HSPs
were expressed more in poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinomas as compared with well-differentiated ductal adenocarcinomas. Recent studies in our laboratory have shown that HSP70
is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer cells, whereas the inhibition
of its expression results in apoptotic cell death (3).
Therefore, our overall aim is to pharmacologically manipulate
the levels of HSP70 in order to use its down-regulation as a tool to
improve the prognosis of pancreatic cancer. Westerheide et al. (5)
recently did a small molecule screen which identified triptolide, a
diterpene triepoxide from the Chinese plant Tripterygium wilfordii,
as an inhibitor of human heat shock gene transcription. Triptolide
has been widely used as a natural medicine in China for hundreds
of years, particularly in the treatment of autoimmune and
inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.
Several reports have indicated that triptolide can inhibit the
proliferation of cancer cells in vitro and reduce the growth and
metastases of tumors in vivo (6–10). To date, in vivo studies have
shown that triptolide inhibits the growth of (a) human mammary
tumor cells in nude mice (8), (b) cholangiocarcinoma cells in
hamsters (9), and (c) xenografts formed by four different tumor
cell lines (melanoma, breast cancer, bladder cancer, and gastric
carcinoma; ref. 10). In addition, clinical trials in China using
triptolide have shown remission rates of 71% and 87% in
mononucleocytic and granulocytic leukemia, respectively (11).
However, no previous reports have examined triptolide’s ability to
induce pancreatic cancer cell death in vivo, and its mechanism of
action is not well understood. Therefore, the aims of this study
were to examine the effect of triptolide on (a) pancreatic cancer
cell growth and apoptosis in vitro, (b) pancreatic cancer growth
in vivo, and (c) HSP70 expression in pancreatic cancer cells.

reagents were purchased from Sigma. Pancreatic cancer cells were a
generous gift from Dr. Edward E. Whang (Brigham and Women’s Hospital,
Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Mouse pancreatic ductal cells
(primary isolates) were a kind gift from Dr. Anil K. Rustgi (University of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA).
Cell culture. Pancreatic cancer cells (MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1) were
cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillinstreptomycin. Mouse pancreatic ductal cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12
medium (1:1) with 5 mg/L of D-glucose, 0.1 mg/mL of soybean trypsin
inhibitor type I, 5 mL/L of ITS+, 25 Ag/mL of bovine pituitary extract,
5 nmol/L of 3,3¶,5-triiodo-L-thyronine, 1 Amol/L of dexamethasone,
1.22 mg/mL of nicotinamide, 5% Nu-Serum, 100 ng/mL of cholera
toxin, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (12). All cells were maintained at
37jC in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.
The human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells (American Type Culture
Collection) were cultured in McCoy’s medium, supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37jC.
Treatment of cells with triptolide. Cells were seeded in six-well plates
at a density of 2.5  105 cells and were then incubated overnight at 37jC
for analysis of protein, RNA, or apoptosis. Cells were seeded into 96-well
plates using 1  104 cells per well for viability measurements. Triptolide was
dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 1 Amol/L, added to cells at the
indicated concentrations in serum-free medium, and incubated for varying
times at 37jC. Cells treated with medium containing vehicle served as
controls.
Determination of cell viability. Cell viability was determined using
the Dojindo Cell Counting Kit-8. Cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at
1  104 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. After treatment with
triptolide at various concentrations for 24 and 48 h, 10 AL of the tetrazolium
substrate was added to each well of the plate. Plates were incubated at
37jC for 1 h, after which the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. All
experiments were done in triplicate and repeated four independent times.
Measurement of Annexin V–positive cells. Phosphatidylserine externalization was analyzed using the Guava Nexin Kit by flow cytometry, as
previously described (3).
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling assay for measurement of in situ apoptosis. Pancreatic tumor
cells were cultured on chamber slides. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was then
carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions (In Situ Cell Death
Detection Kit; Roche). Paraffin-embedded pancreatic tumor tissue sections
from control and triptolide-treated mice were also processed for TUNEL
using the above kit.
Caspase-3 measurements. Caspase-3 activity was analyzed using the
Caspase-Glo luminescent-based assays according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells (1  104) were seeded into 96-well white opaque plates
and a corresponding optically clear 96-well plate, then allowed to adhere
overnight. The next day, cells were treated with varying concentrations of
triptolide for varying periods of time. At the end of the incubation time,
100 AL of the appropriate Caspase-Glo reagent was added to each well
containing 100 AL of blank, negative control, or treated cells in culture
medium. Plates were gently mixed and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. The luminescence was then read in a luminometer. The
corresponding 96-well clear plate was used to measure the number of
viable cells with the CCK-8 reagent. Caspase activity was normalized to
these values.
Cytochrome c ELISA. Following treatment with triptolide for 24 h, cells
were harvested with trypsin and centrifuged briefly at 800  g. Then, the
supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was resuspended and washed
with PBS. Cells were pelleted at 1,000  g for 5 min and the supernatant
was discarded. The cell pellet was then resuspended with digitonin cell
permeabilization buffer (250 mmol/L sucrose, 137 mmol/L NaCl, 70 mmol/L
KCl, 4.3 mmol/L Na2HPO4, 1.4 mmol/L K2HPO4, 0.2 mg/mL digitonin and
0.1% Hydorol M), vortexed and incubated on ice for 5 min. Cells were then
centrifuged at 1,000  g for 5 min at 4jC. The supernatants contained the
cytosolic fraction. The remaining pellet was finally resuspended with

radioimmunoprecipitation assay cell lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton
X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS], vortexed and incubated on
ice for 5 min. The lysate was vortexed and centrifuged at 10,000  g for
10 min at 4jC. The supernatant contained the mitochondrial fraction. Both
fractions were stored at 80jC until it was analyzed in ELISA. Cytochrome
c measurements were done using the ELISA kit from Calbiochem according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantitative real-time PCR for HSP70. The expression of HSP70 was
examined in pancreatic cancer cells after they were treated with triptolide
using real-time quantitative PCR. Briefly, RNA was extracted using the
Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
treated with DNase-I on the column. Total RNA (1 Ag) was reverse
transcribed. Real-time PCR was done using the Quantitect Sybr green PCR
kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using an Applied
Biosystems 7300 real-time PCR system. HSP70 mRNA sequences were
retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site,
and the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST server was
used to determine primer specificity.
HSP70 forward primer, 5¶-ACCAAGCAGACGCAGATCTTC-3¶; reverse
primer, 5¶-CGCCCTCGTACACCTGGAT-3¶ (amplicon size, 78 bp). All data
were normalized to the housekeeping gene 18S (18S Quantitect Primer
Assay; Qiagen).
Measurement of HSP70 levels by Western blotting. Cell lysates were
prepared by resuspending cells in lysis buffer [65 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Nonidet P40, 1% sodium
deoxycholate, 1 Ag/mL aprotinin, and 100 Ag/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride] for 30 min at 4jC and cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at
13,000  g. Supernatants were collected and stored at 80jC. Total protein
concentration was determined using the Pierce bicinchoninic acid assay.
Western blotting for HSP70 was done as previously described using a
monoclonal antibody from Stressgen, which binds to the epitope
corresponding to the common amino acid residues 436 to 503 of the
human and mouse protein (13). Equal protein loading was confirmed by
staining with Ponceau S [0.1% Ponceau S (w/v) in 5% acetic acid (v/v)].
Actin expression was used as an internal control.
Development of stable pancreatic cancer cell line. To study
pancreatic cancer growth in vivo, MiaPaCa-2 cells were stably transfected
with the luciferase gene. The luciferase coding sequence was isolated from
the pGL-3 vector (Promega) and cloned into the retroviral plasmid pBabepuro behind the SV40 promoter to form the luciferase-expressing retrovirus
(pBabe-puro-Luciferase). pBabe-puro-luciferase and pMDG (encoding the
VSV envelope glycoprotein) were transfected (5  105 in six-well plates)
into the Phoenix packaging cell line using Effectene transfection reagent
(Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight hours
after transfection, viral supernatants were collected, filtered through a
0.2-Am filter and transferred onto MiaPaca-2 cells (1 105 in six-well plates)
for a 5-h infection in the presence of Polybrene (8Ag/mL; Sigma). After 5 h,
the culture medium was then replaced by fresh medium. After overnight
culture, cells were incubated with puromycin (4 Ag/mL; Calbiochem) for a
period of 2 weeks for selection. Luciferase expression was confirmed using
the Dual Luciferase Assay (Promega), and emitted light was directly
proportional to cell number.
Orthotopic pancreatic tumors in nude mice. To study the effect of
triptolide on pancreatic tumors in vivo, we used an orthotopic mouse
model. MiaPaca-2 cells were stably transfected with luciferase, as described
above. Following harvesting of cells, trypan blue exclusion was used to
confirm that cells were >90% viable. Cells were resuspended in Matrigel at a
concentration of 1 million cells per 10 AL and kept on ice until injected.
Female nude mice (4–6 weeks old from Charles River Laboratories) were
anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg and 10 mg/kg) and the
surgical procedure was carried out according to the guidelines of the
University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Briefly, a small left abdominal flank incision was made, and the spleen and
pancreas were exteriorized. MiaPaCa-2 tumor cells (1 million cells) were
injected into the tail of the pancreas with a Hamilton syringe. The fact that
cells were in Matrigel prevented any i.p. leakage because the Matrigel sets at

37jC. Both layers of the abdominal wound were closed with stitches and
wound clips.
Six days after tumor transplantation, mice were injected i.p. with
D-luciferin (150 mg/kg) and anesthetized. After D-luciferin injection
(8–10 min), luminescence was measured using a Xenogen imaging system,
which determined that all tumors were of a similar size. Mice were then
randomized into two treatment groups: (a) control and (b) triptolidetreated mice. Mice were given daily i.p. injections of triptolide (0.2 mg/kg)
or vehicle (DMSO) for 60 days. Tumor volume was calculated as 0.5 
length  width  depth. Local-regional spread was determined macroscopically at autopsy as well as by a blinded pathologist. Intrapancreatic
tumors were rapidly excised and divided into three fragments. One
fragment was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80jC for

protein extraction and analysis of HSP70 by Western blot, as described
above. Another fragment was stored in RNAlater for RNA extraction and
analysis of HSP70 by real-time PCR. A third tumor fragment was fixed in
formalin and embedded in paraffin for subsequent H&E staining and
TUNEL staining.
HSP70 immunohistochemistry. Antigen retrieval was done on paraffinembedded pancreatic tumor tissue sections using 10 mmol/L of citrate
buffer (pH 6.0). Sections were blocked with 2.5% horse serum and
subsequently incubated in blocking buffer containing a rabbit polyclonal
antibody against HSP70 according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Abcam). Sections were then incubated with the secondary antibody
(horseradish peroxidase–labeled horse anti-rabbit) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Vector Lab). 3,3¶-Diaminobenzidine was used

Results
The Effect of Triptolide on Pancreatic Cancer Cell
Viability
The effect of triptolide on the viability of pancreatic cancer cells
or normal pancreatic ductal cells was examined after incubation
in medium containing triptolide at concentrations of 50 to
200 nmol/L for 24 and 48 h. Cells incubated in the medium
without triptolide served as controls. The presence of triptolide
significantly reduced both MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell viability in a
dose- and time-dependent manner, whereas little effect was
observed on the viability of normal ductal cells (Fig. 1).

The Effect of Triptolide on Apoptosis in Pancreatic
Cancer Cells
To assess the mechanism by which triptolide induces cell death,
several markers of apoptosis were analyzed, including (a) Annexin
V, (b) TUNEL, (c) caspase activity, and (d) cytochrome c release
from the mitochondria.
Annexin V. Phosphatidylserine externalization is a parameter
of apoptosis, which can be measured by Annexin V staining. After
24 h, triptolide dose-dependently increased Annexin V in both

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells (Fig. 1C). This result confirms that
cell death induced by triptolide in pancreatic cancer cells is facilitated by the induction of apoptosis.
TUNEL. In situ apoptosis was measured using TUNEL staining.
Both the MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells incubated with triptolide
for 48 h showed significantly increased TUNEL staining, as
compared with control cells incubated with the vehicle alone
(Fig. 1D).
Caspase-3 activity. To determine the effect of triptolide on
caspase-3 activity, MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells were incubated
with triptolide (50–200 nmol/L) for 12 and 24 h. Incubation of
MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 in culture medium containing triptolide
resulted in a statistically significant increase in caspase-3 activity in
a dose- and time-dependent manner, as compared with control
cells (Fig. 2A and B). An increase in caspase-3 activity was first
evident 12 h after incubation with triptolide and continued to
increase over time. These results indicate that the observed
decrease in pancreatic cancer cell viability after incubation with
triptolide was due to caspase-dependent activation of apoptosis.
Cytochrome c. Cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria
in response to an apoptotic stimulus, which activates the caspase
cascade and finally leads to apoptosis. Therefore, we examined
cytochrome c release from the mitochondria of pancreatic cancer
cells after incubation with triptolide for 24 h. Triptolide
significantly increased cytochrome c release from the mitochondria in both MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells (Fig. 2C). Triptolide
reduced mitochondrial cytochrome c by 50%, suggesting its
increased release from the mitochondria. In support of this fact,
triptolide increased cytosolic cytochrome c. In summary, triptolide
is capable of initiating apoptotic cell death in pancreatic cancer

cells via increased cytochrome c release from the mitochondria,
after which, the caspase cascade is activated.

The Effect of Triptolide on HSP70 Levels in Pancreatic
Cancer Cells
Given that triptolide was recently identified (5) as part of a small
molecule screen for regulators of the human heat shock gene
transcription (5), and considering that our laboratory has
previously shown that the inhibition of HSP70 expression causes
pancreatic cancer cell death (3), the effect of triptolide on HSP70
expression in MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 was analyzed by real-time
PCR and Western blot.
Triptolide (50–200 nmol/L) significantly decreased HSP70 mRNA
expression by MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 at both 12 and 24 h, as

compared with control cells not exposed to triptolide (Fig. 3A). In
accordance with its effect on mRNA expression, triptolide also
significantly decreased HSP70 protein levels in both MiaPaCa-2
and PANC-1 (Fig. 3B and C). Given that triptolide had little effect
on normal pancreatic duct cell viability, we assessed its effect on
HSP70 levels in these cells. The results show that triptolide had no
effect on HSP70 protein expression by normal pancreatic duct cells
(Fig. 3D). Together, the above data suggests that triptolide causes
pancreatic cancer cell death by inhibiting HSP70 expression.

The Effect of Triptolide on Pancreatic Tumor Growth
In vivo
To examine the effects of triptolide on pancreatic cancer growth
and local-regional spread, MiaPaCa-2 cells (stably transfected with

means; bars, SE (n = 3; *, P < 0.05). Triptolide also decreased HSP70 protein levels in MiaPaCa-2 (B ) and PANC-1 (C ) at 12 and 24 h (representative Western blots for
HSP70 and actin). However, triptolide had no effect on normal pancreatic ductal cells (D ). Membranes were stripped and reprobed for actin to show equal protein
loading (n = 4).

In accordance with the in vitro data, decreased tumor size
following treatment with triptolide was associated with increased
TUNEL staining in tumor sections, as compared with sections from
control mice (Fig. 4D). This data suggests that triptolide-induced
cell death in vivo is a result of apoptosis.

luciferase) were injected into the pancreas, as described in
Methods. Prior to the commencement of treatment, luminescence
was measured using a Xenogen Imaging System, which determined
that all tumors were of a similar size. Mice were then randomized
into two treatment groups with the same mean tumor size: (a)
control and (b) triptolide-treated mice. After a daily injection of
triptolide (0.2 mg/kg) for 60 days, the tumor volume was significantly reduced (Fig. 4A), as compared with controls injected
with DMSO vehicle. In fact, two mice in the triptolide treatment
group had no macroscopically visible tumor, which was confirmed
by histologic analysis. Importantly, triptolide had no effect on body
weight and mice displayed no signs of toxicity. Furthermore, the
results in Table 1 indicate that triptolide also significantly reduced
the incidence of local-regional tumor spread. A pathologic
evaluation of the local organs listed in Table 1 showed that 87.5%
of mice from the control group had local tumor spread, as
compared with 12.5% of mice from the triptolide-treated group
(P < 0.001; m2 analysis). Mice in the control group had significantly
increased (P < 0.02; m2 analysis) local spread of tumor cells into the
spleen and intestine, as compared with mice from the triptolidetreated group. Examples of local spread in the form of tumor
nodules in the spleen, kidney, and bowel can be seen in Fig. 4B.
Note that arrows point toward tumors.
In order to provide information on the mechanism by which
triptolide suppresses the growth of pancreatic tumors in vivo,
we measured HSP70 levels in pancreatic tumor tissue from both
triptolide and control treated mice. Figure 4C shows that HSP70 levels
were significantly decreased (as assessed by real-time PCR) in
tumors from mice treated with triptolide, as compared with mice
treated with vehicle. Similar results were obtained with protein levels
as assessed by Western blot (Fig. 4C). In addition, immunohistochemistry showed decreased HSP70 expression in tumor sections
from mice treated with triptolide, as compared with mice treated with
vehicle (Fig. 4C). This confirms our in vitro data in which triptolide
induces pancreatic cancer cell death via decreasing HSP70 levels.

Given that HSP70 has previously been reported to be overexpressed in colon cancer cells, we tested whether or not triptolide
could induce colon cancer cell death by the inhibition of HSP70, in
a similar fashion to the results in pancreatic cancer, described
above. The effect of triptolide on colon cancer cell viability was
examined after incubation in medium containing triptolide
(50–400 nmol/L) for 24 and 48 h. Cells incubated in medium
without triptolide served as controls. The presence of triptolide
significantly reduced HT29 cell viability in a time-dependent
manner (Fig. 5). The observed decrease in viability was associated
with increased Annexin V levels (Fig. 5B), and significantly
decreased HSP70 mRNA (Fig. 5C) and protein levels (Fig. 5D).
Therefore, triptolide-induced cell death in colon cancer cells is
mediated by induction of apoptosis via the inhibition of HSP70.
These results further confirm that triptolide’s mechanism of action
is via inhibition of HSP70.

Discussion
This study has shown that low nanomolar concentrations of
triptolide induce pancreatic cancer cell death, without affecting the
viability of normal pancreatic duct cells. The mechanism by which
triptolide induces pancreatic cancer cell death is by induction of
apoptosis via the inhibition of HSP70. In addition, in vivo
administration of triptolide decreased tumor growth and almost
completely prevented local-regional tumor spread in an orthotopic
nude mouse model of pancreatic cancer. This decrease in tumor
growth was also associated with increased TUNEL and decreased
HSP70 levels in the tumor.
In the present study, incubation with triptolide significantly
decreased pancreatic cancer cell viability in two pancreatic cancer
cell lines, but did not affect that of normal pancreatic ductal cells.
Next, we examined whether the apoptosis pathway was responsible
for triptolide-induced pancreatic cancer cell death. Triptolide
induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells, with significant
increases in Annexin V and TUNEL staining. Our data concur with
the results of a study by Wang et al. (14), showing that triptolide
increased apoptosis in PANC-1 cells. Although the mechanism of
action of triptolide has not been fully elucidated, it has been shown
to induce caspase activation (15–17). One pathway of caspase
activation is the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway, from which
cytochrome c is released into the cytosol, which then binds with

levels in the tumor tissue (see representative pancreatic tumor tissue sections from control and triptolide treatment groups immunostained for HSP70). The negative
control was a tumor section from a control mouse incubated without the primary antibody. Increased purple staining in the control tumor tissue depicts increased
HSP70 levels. D, representative pancreatic tumor tissue sections stained for TUNEL showed increased TUNEL staining, which is indicative of apoptosis in the triptolide

apoptosis protease activator factor-1 and activates caspase-9
(18, 19). Activation of the downstream effector caspase-3 follows
(18, 19). Our results show that, following incubation with triptolide,
caspase-3 activity is significantly increased in two pancreatic
cancer cell lines, thus strongly suggesting that the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway is responsible for triptolide-induced cell death.
In addition, triptolide induced cytochrome c release from the
mitochondria in pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that apoptosis
is induced upstream of the mitochondria. Therefore, the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway plays a critical role in triptolideinduced cell death. These results concur with those obtained in
leukemia cell lines with triptolide (15).
Cancer research in the last 20 years has identified several
proteins that are involved in promoting tumorigenesis via their
inhibition of apoptosis, including HSPs (20). HSPs are highly
conserved proteins which play a role in protecting cells from
adverse environmental, physical, and chemical stresses. HSP70 is
the major stress-inducible HSP, which renders cells highly resistant
to several chemotherapeutic drugs (21–26). Our laboratory and
others have shown that clinical pancreatic tumors have increased
levels of HSP70 compared with normal tissue from the same
patients (3, 27), whereas Ogata et al. (4) found that more HSPs were
expressed in poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinomas
compared with well-differentiated ductal adenocarcinomas. Given
the above, depleting HSP70 is a means of combating pancreatic
cancer. However, only a small number of pharmacologic HSP70
inhibitors have been identified. These include quercetin (a
bioflavonoid; refs. 28, 29) and KNK437 (a benzylidene lactam

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

compound; ref. 30). Westerheide et al. (5) recently identified
triptolide, a diterpene triepoxide derived from the Chinese plant
T. wilfordii, as part of a small molecule screen, as an inhibitor of
the human heat shock response. However, this group only analyzed
triptolide’s ability to regulate HSP70 in response to heat shock,
and found that in HeLa cells, triptolide prevented the induction of
HSP70 mRNA by heat shock (5). However, triptolide’s ability to
affect basal HSP70 levels has not been previously examined. We
show here for the first time that triptolide is a potent inhibitor of
both HSP70 mRNA and of protein levels in pancreatic cancer cells.
In accordance with triptolide having a minimal effect on the cell
viability of normal pancreatic ductal cells, triptolide did not
influence HSP70 expression in these cells. This suggests that
triptolide possibly interacts with the regulatory elements responsible for increased expression of HSP70 in cancer cells, which may
be different from that involved in the overexpression of HSP70
during the heat shock response.
To examine whether the effect of triptolide on HSP70 expression
is limited to pancreatic cancer cells exclusively, or if it is a general
phenomenon applicable to other cancer cells, we examined the
effect of triptolide on the colon cancer cell line HT-29 because high
levels of HSP70 expression have been correlated with poor
prognosis in colon cancer cells (31). Triptolide significantly
reduced HT-29 cell viability, which was associated with an increase
in apoptosis. Our data concur with a recent study by Ko et al. (32)
showing that triptolide induced HT-29 cell death via increased
apoptosis. Similar to the data obtained with pancreatic cancer,
triptolide decreased HSP70 levels in HT29 cells. These results

Triptolide and Pancreatic Cancer

provide further evidence that triptolide is a potent inhibitor of
HSP70 in cancer cells. Additional evidence that triptolide-induced
cell death is mediated via its effect on HSP70 comes from our
recent work which showed that HSP70 inhibition by short interfering RNA significantly decreases pancreatic cancer cell viability as
a result of increased apoptosis (3).
The exact site at which HSP70 interacts with the apoptotic
cascade is controversial. Some studies have suggested that HSP70
may inhibit apoptosis by acting downstream of mitochondria and
cytochrome c release (33–35). However, recent studies using
cellular death models suggest that HSP70-mediated inhibition of
caspase-dependent apoptosis occurs upstream of mitochondrial
outer membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release
(36–38). Stankiewicz et al. (39) have suggested that HSP70 prevents
the activation and translocation of Bax to the mitochondrial
membrane, and thus, protects the cell against mitochondrial
membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c release, and activation
of the caspase cascade.
HSP70 can also inhibit caspase-independent apoptosis by
inhibiting apoptosis-inhibiting factor (40). Additional mechanisms
that have been proposed to explain the antiapoptotic effect of
HSP70 include the modulation of the activity of stress kinases such
as c-Jun-NH2-kinase (41) and interaction with nuclear factor-nB
(42). Some studies have suggested that the ATPase domain of
HSP70 and its chaperone function is required for its action at some
of these sites (38). Thus, it seems that the site and mechanism by
which HSP70 inhibits apoptosis depends, to a large extent, on the
cell type. Our data strongly suggests that the possible site of its
action is upstream of the mitochondria in pancreatic cancer cells.
The exact mechanism by which HSP70 inhibits apoptosis upstream
of mitochondria in these cells is currently under investigation in
our laboratory.
We also examined the effect of triptolide on pancreatic cancer
growth using an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer derived
from the highly malignant pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCa-2.
Daily triptolide administration decreased pancreatic tumor growth
in vivo. This decrease in tumor size was associated with decreased
HSP70 mRNA and protein expression in tumor tissue (by Western
blot and immunohistochemistry), thereby confirming that triptolide decreases pancreatic tumor cell viability via lowering HSP70.
In addition, triptolide also significantly reduced the incidence of
local-regional tumor spread. In accordance with the in vitro data,
decreased tumor size following treatment with triptolide was associated with increased TUNEL staining in tumor sections, suggesting that triptolide-induced cell death in vivo is a result of apoptosis.
Although our data is encouraging, we cannot completely rule out
that triptolide might affect pancreatic cancer cell death by other
mechanisms in addition to HSP70 inhibition. However, we believe
that one of the major effects of triptolide is mediated via inhibition
of HSP70 expression for several reasons:

(a) Triptolide is a potent inhibitor of HSP70 transcription.
Triptolide significantly decreased HSP70 mRNA and protein
levels in two pancreatic cancer cell lines, in tumor tissue, as well
as in a colon cancer cell line.
(b) Inhibition of HSP70 by triptolide corresponds with the
induction of apoptosis. Triptolide induced pancreatic cancer
cell death via induction of apoptosis in a similar manner to our
previous observations using HSP70-specific short interfering
RNA (3).
(c) Triptolide does not inhibit HSP70 in normal pancreatic duct
cells, and has a minimal effect on their viability. Our results
show that triptolide had a minimal effect on normal pancreatic
duct cell viability and because these cells have much lower levels
of HSP70 than do pancreatic tumor cells (3), this suggests that
triptolide promotes cell death in the cancer cells by inhibiting
HSP70 levels.
The regulation of HSP70 gene transcription is complex and
involves heat shock elements which are promoter sites that have a
high affinity for binding to a family of heat shock transcription
factors (HSF). HSF1 is well characterized and is required for the
regulation of HSP70. The inhibitory mechanism of triptolide on
HSP70 transcription might be attributed to the inhibition of
the activation of HSF1 or the interaction of HSF1 with heat shock
elements. For example, the other HSP70 inhibitor, Quercetin, has
been reported to inhibit HSP70 expression by blocking HSF1 and
reducing HSP70 mRNA accumulation (28, 43). Although Westerheide et al. (5) have examined the mechanism by which triptolide
inhibits the heat shock response, their work may provide some
clues for the regulation of HSP70 in cancer cells. They propose that
triptolide inhibits the assembly of functional transcriptionally
active HSF1 complexes on the HSP70 promoter. Presently, our
laboratory is working toward understanding precisely where and
how triptolide inhibits HSP70 transcription.
In conclusion, triptolide causes pancreatic cancer cell death
in vitro and in vivo by the induction of apoptosis, and its
mechanism of action is mediated via the inhibition of HSP70. In
addition, we have provided further support that HSP70 confers
resistance to apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. Therefore,
triptolide is a potential therapeutic agent that can be used to
prevent the progression and metastases of pancreatic cancer.
