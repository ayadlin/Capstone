BACKGROUND. Because medulloblastoma (MB) is rare in adults, the few studies
on this condition have been retrospective, and the follow-up has tended to be
short. Furthermore, the different therapeutic strategies used in these patients has
made it difficult to assess survival rates and prognostic factors.

METHODS. In 1989, a prospective Phase II trial was initiated to evaluate the efficacy of treatment for adults with MB. Patients were staged completely with a
neuroradiologic examination of the brain and neuroaxis and by cerebrospinal
fluid cytology, according to Chang’s staging system. Low-risk patients received
radiotherapy alone, whereas high-risk patients received 2 cycles of upfront chem-

cle reports on the long-term results from that trial.

RESULTS. After a median follow up of 7.6 years, among a total of 36 adults with
5 years were 72% and 75%, respectively. In low-risk patients, the 5-year PFS rate
was 80%, and the 5-year OS rate was 80%; in high-risk patients, the 5-year PFS
rate was 69%, and the 5-year OS rate was 73%.

CONCLUSIONS. In adult patients with MB, long-term follow-up was essential for
evaluating the real impact of treatments. Low-risk and high-risk patients did not
differ significantly in terms of PFS or OS. Cancer 2007;110:2035–41.  2007

edulloblastoma (MB) is rare in adults and is diagnosed in
approximately 0.5 of 100,000 patients per year. Because of its
rarity, most available studies on MB in adults have been retrospective and have reported on limited patient populations. Moreover,
the radiotherapy and chemotherapy strategies and schedules used
vary, and the median follow-up ranges from 51 months to 104
months.1,2 Clearly, such methodological and clinical differences
have an important influence on the reliability of any attempt to
identify prognostic factors and to predict the outcomes of the different treatment strategies in these studies.

In 1989 a prospective trial was started, and 36 adult patients with
MB were accrued for the study.3 All patients provided their fully
informed consent to take part in the study by signing a form, which
was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Padova University Hospital (Italy). The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the rules of good clinical
practice. The patients were staged using the classic Chang system

definitions for tumor (T) and metastasis (M) parameters4 (Table 1). Residual disease after surgery
(defined as disease that measured 1.5 cm2) also
was taken into account in the classification into lowrisk and high-risk groups. The low-risk group comprised patients who had T1, T2, T3a, and M0 disease
and no residual disease after surgery. The high-risk
group comprised patients who had T3b through T4
and M1, M2, M3 disease and patients who had postoperative residual tumor. Low-risk patients received
radiation therapy alone, which started within 28 days
of surgery. High-risk patients were given 2 cycles of
upfront chemotherapy before radiotherapy. After
receiving this treatment, patients with M1, M2, or
M3 disease were given maintenance chemotherapy,
which consisted of 4 cycles; otherwise, 2 cycles more
than the number required for complete remission
were planned. Radiotherapy consisted of craniospinal
radiation at a dose of 36 grays (Gy) in 20 fractions of
1.8 Gy/5 fractions per week, followed by a boost of
18.8 Gy in 10 fractions to the posterior fossa (up to a
total of 54.8 Gy). In patients with M3 spinal disease,
the dose was 39.6 Gy in 22 fractions delivered only to
the spinal cord. Between 1989 and 1995, in accordance with the findings of a multicenter trial of the
International Society of Pediatric Oncology,5 patients
received a mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP)-like regimen that consisted of intravenous nitrogen mustard (3 mg/m2 on
Days 1 and 8), intravenous vincristine (1.4 mg/m2
[maximum 2 mg] on Days 1 and 8), oral prednisone
(40 mg/m2 on Days 1 to 10), and procarbazine
(50 mg on Day 1, 100 mg on Day 2, and 100 mg/m2
on Days 3-10). The protocol was amended in 1995 in
view of reports6 indicating that cisplatin-based regimens were more effective in adults with advanced
embryonic central nervous system tumors, and
MOPP chemotherapy was replaced with the following
regimen: cisplatin 25 mg/m2 daily for 4 days, etoposide 40 mg/m2 daily for 4 days, and cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2 on Day 4: This cycle was repeated
every 4 weeks. Twenty-two of 26 high-risk patients
agreed to be treated with upfront chemotherapy,
which consisted of an MOPP regimen in 6 patients
and a cisplatin-based combination in 16 patients.
Drug doses were modified in patients with hematologic toxicity, which was diagnosed on the basis of
neutrophil and platelet counts at nadir and on the
day of treatment, as described elsewhere.3
In low-risk patients, contrast-enhanced brain
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were
obtained every 3 months. Spinal MRI studies were
obtained every 6 months for the first 2 years, they
were repeated every 6 months thereafter for up to

5 years, and they were obtained yearly thereafter.
Patients with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination and spinal MRI studies 6 weeks after the end of
radiotherapy and after every 2 cycles of postradiation
chemotherapy until the complete disappearance
of disseminated disease. Follow-up controls were
made after metastatic disease disappearance every 6
months with brain MRI studies, and spinal MRI studies also were obtained every 12 months.
In patients without metastasis at diagnosis, CSF
was examined only if there was a clinical suspicion
of leptomeningeal tumor recurrence. After the identification of disease recurrence, patients underwent
MRI studies of the entire neuroaxis and CSF
cytology.

Statistical Analysis
Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
(OS) were measured from the time of surgery to the
date of disease progression or death, respectively, or
to the date of last follow-up and were analyzed using
the Kaplan-Meier method. The 95% confidence intervals were calculated using associated estimated
standard errors. The log-rank test was used to compare low-risk and high-risk groups and to test the

sex, the presence of a shunt, residual disease, T stage,
M stage, histologic subtype, location of lesions, postoperative Karnofsky performance score, duration of
radiotherapy, and the time between surgery and the
start of radiotherapy.

RESULTS
Between January 1989 and February 2001, 36 patients
(27 men and 9 women) who had a histologic diagnosis of MB were treated according to the abovedescribed protocol. Patients’ characteristics and
study treatments are reported in Table 2. Thirty-six
patients were treated according to the protocol:
Twenty-six patients were classified as high risk, and
10 patients were classified as low risk.

PFS
In the current study, after a median follow-up of 7.6
years, the overall median PFS in low-risk patients
was 9.3 years (range, from 5.9 years to not achieved),
whereas no median PFS was achieved in high-risk
patients. The PFS rate at 5 years was 80% (95% CI,
59-100%) and 69% (95% CI, 54-89%) in low-risk
patients and high-risk patients, respectively (P 5 not
significant [NS]) (Fig. 1).

or M3] disease, 61%; 95% CI, 40%-95%; P 5 NS), nor
the presence of residual disease after surgery (5-year
PFS rate: patients without residual disease, 82%; 95%
CI, 62%-100%; patients with residual disease, 68%; 95%
CI, 52-89%) had a significant effect on the 5-year PFS
rate. However, the 5-year PFS rate was 82% (95% CI,
68-98%) in patients with T1 through T3a disease and
44% (95% CI, 21-92%) in patients with T3b through
T4 disease (borderline significance; P 5 .06).
The 5-year PFS rate was not significant for highrisk patients who received upfront chemotherapy
with MOPP or diethylcarbamazine (P 5 .9). At the
time of this protocol, patients with T3b M0 disease
were considered high risk; thus, data were reanalyzed
on the basis of the current risk classification (high
risk [M1, M2, M3] and residual disease >1.5 cm2).
However, PFS at 5 years remained nonsignificant
(P 5 .82).

OS
At a median follow-up of 7.6 years, the median OS
(10.7 years in low-risk patients) was not achieved in
high-risk patients. The 5-year OS rate was 80% (95%
CI, 58-100%) and 73% (95% CI, 58-92%) in low-risk
and high-risk patients, respectively (P 5 NS) (Fig. 2).
Survival at 5 years was not influenced by metastatic
status at the time of diagnosis (5-year OS rate: Mnegative patients, 83%; 95% CI, 69-100%; M-positive
patients, 62%; 95% CI, 40-95%; P 5 NS) or by the
presence of residual disease after surgery (5-year OS

rate: patients without residual disease, 82%; 95% CI,
62-100%; patients with residual disease, 72%; 95% CI,
56-92%). However, the 5-year OS rate was 82% (95%
CI, 68-98%) in patients with T1 through T3a disease
and 56% (95% CI, 31-100%) in patients with T3b and
T4 disease (P 5 .04).

The therapeutic approaches used for recurrence
were stereotactic radiotherapy in 1 patient, chemotherapy in 14 patients, and no treatment in 2
patients. OS after disease recurrence was 15 months
(range, 1-44 months).

Toxicity
The median duration of radiotherapy was 46 days
(range, 35-70 days) overall, and it was 46.5 days
(range, 39-79 days) and 45 days (range, 35-59 days)
for patients who did and did not receive preradiation
chemotherapy, respectively. Toxicity during radiotherapy was thrombocytopenia (grade 2, 20%; grade 3,
20%) and leukopenia (grade 2, 20%) in low-risk
patients who did not receive preradiation chemotherapy and thrombocytopenia (grades 2, 11%; grade 3,
15%; grade 4, 3%) and leukopenia (grade 2, 20%;
grade 3, 7%; grade 4, 3%) in high-risk patients. In 2
high-risk patients (7%), treatment was interrupted
because of radiation-related toxicity (thrombocytopenia) for 22 days and 7 days, respectively.

DISCUSSION

Recurrence
At a median follow-up of 7.6 years, in total, 17
patients developed recurrent disease (47%); the median time to disease progression was 36 months
(range, 4-129 months), and 15 patients (41.7%) had
died. Eleven patients (42.3%) in the high-risk group
and 6 patients (60%) in the low-risk group developed
recurrent disease. Figure 3 illustrates that the risk
of recurrence appeared to increase markedly after
7 years of follow-up in low-risk patients and after
10 years of follow-up in high-risk patients.

The widespread tendency almost always to treat
adult patients with MB according to pediatric protocols has been based on the assumption that, in
adults, this tumor has the same properties that it has
in children. However, few prospective clinical trials
are available in adults, and those studies are retrospective. In addition, the different treatments given
spanned decades, during which diagnostic procedures, neurosurgical skills, and radiotherapy techniques have changed.
Surgery and postoperative radiotherapy long
have been considered the cornerstones for the treatment of MB in adult and pediatric patients. Conventional radiotherapy doses of approximately 36 Gy in
adults are delivered to the craniospinal axis together
with a boost of 18 to 20 Gy to the posterior fossa.7–9
The authors of retrospective studies have reported
that from 40% to 70% of adult patients are progression-free 5 years after diagnosis. Because risk assessment and late toxicity have been taken into account
in randomized clinical trials in pediatric patients,
patients with average-risk MB currently receive dosereduced radiotherapy (craniospinal irradiation, 23.4 Gy
with a boost up to 55.8 Gy to the posterior fossa) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, and no difference
has been reported between survival after this regi-

men and survival after 36 Gy to the craniospinal axis
without chemotherapy.10 However, because of the
differences in terms of long-term toxicities between
adult and pediatric patients, this approach has not
been proposed for adult patients, and the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in this setting is not clear.
Some studies failed to demonstrate that it significantly improved PFS, others have suggested that it
does (Table 3). In 5 studies,1,11–14 adjuvant chemotherapy (using different regimens) was given to
adults with MB, and the findings reported for outcome were inconclusive, mainly because the studies
were not prospective and because chemotherapy was
delivered to both high-risk and low-risk patients, and
only a trend toward improvement in survival was
observed in the overall series without a distinction
being made between low-risk and high-risk adult
patients.7
The current article reports the long-term results
from a prospective pilot trial in which only radiotherapy was delivered to low-risk patients, whereas radiotherapy plus chemotherapy was reserved for highrisk adult MB patients. A debate is ongoing about
whether it is more useful to administer chemotherapy before or after radiotherapy. The rationale for
up-front chemotherapy is: 1) the destruction of the
CSF-tumor barrier caused by the operation may
allow drugs to penetrate more easily into the remaining tumor tissue; 2) aggressive chemotherapy is tolerated better, because bone marrow reserves are not
compromised by craniospinal radiotherapy; 3) toxicity profiles potentially are favorable, allowing the
delivery of cisplatin with a decreased likelihood of
severe ototoxicity; and 4) this setting is ideal for testing the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with
measurable postoperative disease. However, those

against this approach postulate that chemotherapy
may delay the initiation of radiotherapy, thus
increasing the risk of tumor progression15–17 and
potentially hindering the completion of craniospinal
radiotherapy. Two randomized studies have been
conducted to compare the efficacy of preoperative
and postoperative chemotherapy in high-risk pediatric patients. In the study by Zeltzer et al.,16 a reduction in the 5 year PFS was reported when 8 in 1
chemotherapy preceded radiotherapy. In the other
study, which was conducted by Kortmann et al.,18
upfront chemotherapy was compared with maintenance chemotherapy, and the results indicated that
the latter treatment was more beneficial. More
recently, a large randomized trial on the treatment of
nonmetastatic MB19 compared chemotherapy plus
radiation with radiotherapy alone and reported
improved survival in patients who received preirradiation chemotherapy. In our high-risk patients, the
receipt of radiotherapy chemotherapy before radiotherapy neither affected the final outcome nor
resulted in tumor progression during its delivery, as
postulated in children, nor did it affect the dosage
and timing of subsequent radiotherapy. These favorable results may have depended on the fact that we
employed a brief, intense, and effective chemotherapy regimen. The same regimen, when administered
after radiotherapy, cannot be delivered at full dosage,
and its toxicity is more sustained.
The results of our study, after a relatively long
follow-up, indicate that the initial differences in both
PFS and OS at 5 years were lost at 10 years, with late
recurrences occurring in 6 of 10 low-risk patients,
including 3 patients who developed recurrences after
100 months. However, statistical comparisons on
only 10 low-risk patients are limited. The prolonged

2040

CANCER

follow-up allowed us to evaluate long-term outcomes
in high-risk patients who received chemotherapy: Fifteen of 18 patients (83%) without disease progression
at the first analysis3 were alive and progression-free
more than 3 years later.
Overall, the data discussed above suggest that
recurrences tend to occur early in low-risk patients
and late in high-risk patients. In our study, the median OS after disease recurrence was 15 months.
Although 3 of 6 low-risk patients with recurrent disease were alive at the time of data analysis, and all
11 patients who had a high-risk of recurrence had
died, no significant difference was observed between
low-risk patients and high-risk patients in the median OS after recurrence (10 months vs 19 months,
respectively; P 5 .19).
To our knowledge, few authors have evaluated
survival analyses stratified on the basis of risk evaluation in adults with MB who received radiotherapy
and chemotherapy. In their study on 47 adults with
MB using risk assessment based on the University of
California–San Francisco risk criteria (high-risk,
>25% residual disease after surgery, brainstem invasion, and/or tumor cells in CSF or metastatic disease), Prados et al.12 observed a significant difference
between high-risk and low-risk patients for 5-year
PFS and OS, and a significant association between
the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy and
OS. Louis et al. used the same risk assessment that
they used in their series of 72 adult MB patients; 28
high-risk patients received a preirradiation carboplatin-etoposide regimen, whereas low-risk patients
received a regimen of radiotherapy alone (unpublished results). After a median follow-up of 24 months,
no significant difference was observed between the
2 groups for PFS or OS. Despite the differences
between the characteristics of the populations studied and the duration of follow-up, those investigators, like us, observed no significant difference
between low-risk patients and high-risk patients in
terms of PFS, OS, or the OS rate.
In the current study, chemotherapy administered
to high-risk patients reduced the risk of recurrence
and death and, even more intriguingly, appeared to
delay the risk of recurrence by approximately 3 years.
The risk of late recurrence in low-risk patients is of
prime importance, because it was reported in a series of patients who were treated in the modern era
in which the chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment protocol remains largely unchanged. The lack
of any significant difference between the PFS and OS
for low-risk and high-risk patients may suggest that,
like pediatric patients, adult patients with low-risk
MB also may be given chemotherapy. However,

although chemotherapy can be given to low-risk
patients, it is too early to consider reducing the
radiotherapy dose like what has been done for lowrisk pediatric patients.
In conclusion, our data show that long-term follow-up is of crucial importance in patients with MB,
because it allows a more accurate definition of the
impact of treatment. In view of the rarity of this disease, referral to specialized centers and a plea to
launch a multicenter randomized clinical trial could
be considered for low-risk adult MB patients to verify
whether adjuvant chemotherapy can increase the
survival of this category of patients.
