Abstract
Blood vessels deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues, and vascular networks are spatially organized to meet
the metabolic needs for maintaining homeostasis. In contrast, the vasculature of tumors is immature and
leaky, resulting in insufficient delivery of nutrients and oxygen. Vasculogenic processes occur normally in adult
tissues to repair “injured” blood vessels, leading us to hypothesize that bone marrow mononuclear cells
(BMMNC) may be able to restore appropriate vessel function in the tumor vasculature. Culturing BMMNCs
in endothelial growth medium resulted in the early outgrowth of spindle-shaped attached cells expressing
CD11b/Flt1/Tie2/c-Kit/CXCR4 with proangiogenic activity. Intravenous administration of these cultured vascular proangiogenic cells (VPC) into nude mice bearing pancreatic cancer xenografts and Pdx1-Cre;LSLKrasG12D;p53lox/+ genetically engineered mice that develop pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma significantly reduced areas of hypoxia without enhancing tumor growth. The resulting vasculature structurally mimicked
normal vessels with intensive pericyte coverage. Increases in vascularized areas within VPC-injected xenografts were visualized with an ultrasound diagnostic system during injection of a microbubble-based contrast
agent (Sonazoid), indicating a functional “normalization” of the tumor vasculature. In addition, gene expression profiles in the VPC-transplanted xenografts revealed a marked reduction in major factors involved in drug
resistance and “stemness” of cancer cells. Together, our findings identify a novel alternate approach to regulate abnormal tumor vessels, offering the potential to improve the delivery and efficacy of anticancer drugs to
hypoxic tumors. Cancer Res; 70(15); 6283–92. ©2010 AACR.

rapid cell division and aberrant blood vessel formation (2).
The vascular networks are usually disordered, chaotic, and
highly leaky, resulting in an insufficient blood supply and,
in general, contributing to tumor hypoxia (3). These structural and functional abnormalities of tumor vessels are a hallmark of solid tumors, one that contributes directly to the
malignant properties of cancer (2, 4). Hypoxic tumors are
usually resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapies, which typically target actively dividing cells (5),
and accumulating evidence indicates that hypoxia has the
potential to inhibit tumor cell differentiation and induce quiescence, allowing cancer cells to acquire a phenotype of
“stemness” (2, 4). To “normalize” this aberrant tumor vasculature, therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) or its cognate receptor have shown clinical success in
various human cancers (6–8). However, antiangiogenic
therapy is not always effective, and intrinsic resistance to this
novel therapy has been shown in some desmoplastic and hypovascular tumors, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC; ref. 9). In addition, antiangiogenic therapy
may alter the natural history of tumors by inducing an invasive and metastatic phenotype (10).

In view of the vasculogenic process that normally occurs in
adult tissues under certain conditions to repair “injured” or
newly formed blood vessels, bone marrow (BM)–derived cells
have therapeutic potential to restore appropriate vessel function. Angiogenesis has been shown to play a central role in
the recovery of the injured tissues including myocardial infarction. We and others have identified BM-derived proangiogenic cells that accumulate in active angiogenic foci
and participate in neovascularization after ischemic insult,
a concept consistent with postnatal vasculogenesis (11–13).
These immature BM-derived cells, which include stem/
progenitor cells, can enhance angiogenesis in ischemic heart
in mice and protect injured tissues from fibrosis, an unfavorable form of tissue remodeling (11). Therefore, we were curious to determine whether bone marrow mononuclear cells
(BMMNC) can also “repair” chaotic tumor vessels and tested
this hypothesis using PDAC as a model for a hypoxic tumor.
We also speculated that oxygen tension may be restored if
the disordered vasculature in solid tumors could be manipulated, which potentially represents a compelling therapeutic
intervention against hypoxic tumors.
In the current study, we propose an alternative approach
to reorganize the abnormal tumor vasculature, which can potentially improve the delivery and efficacy of anticancer
drugs against hypoxic tumors.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Three human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, KP-1N
(from Health Science Research Resources Bank, Osaka, Japan),
Panc-1, and BxPC-3 [both from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)], and four extrapancreatic cancer cell lines,
MKN-28 (from Health Science Research Resources Bank),
SW480, HepG2, and PC-9 (from ATCC), were used in this study.
The hypoxic workstation INVIVO2 400 (Ruskinn) was used
to mimic hypoxic conditions in the tumor microenvironment. Cells were cultured at 5% O2, 5% CO2 for 1 month to
adapt to hypoxic conditions, and cell viability was assessed
by WST-8 assay in normoxic (20% O2) and hypoxic (5% O2)
conditions (Quick Cell Proliferation Assay Kit, Biovision; ref.
14). Briefly, cancer cells were plated in 96-well plates (1 ×
103–5 × 103 per well) and grown up to 72 hours, and the number of cells was quantified using a microtiter plate reader at
450 nm according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Animals, cell transplantation, and
immunohistochemistry
Protocols for animal experiments were approved by the
Asahikawa Medical College Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. Cancer cells were injected s.c. into female
CD-1 nude mice and the xenograft volume was calculated
as (length × width2) × 0.5. Tumors were grown to a minimum
volume of 125 mm3 before vascular proangiogenic cell (VPC)
transplantation. Therapeutic studies were also performed using genetically engineered Pdx1-Cre;LSL-Kras G12D ;p53lox/+
mice, which spontaneously develop PDAC with abundant
desmoplasia (15), at 12 weeks of age when PDAC lesions were

identified by an ultrasound diagnostic system (Aplio XG,
Toshiba Medical Systems).
Murine BMMNCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Histopaque-1083 (Sigma) and cultured in
EBM2 with supplements (EGM2-MV BulletKit, Lonza) and
10% fetal bovine serum but without hydrocortisone in rat
vitronectin (Sigma)-coated dishes for preparation of VPCs
(13, 16). Attached cells were suspended at 4 days and reseeded to a new culture dish for VPC transplantation into
tumor-bearing mice at day 7. More than 95% of attached cells
were positive for acetylated low-density lipoprotein (Biomedical Technologies) uptake and BS1 lectin (Vector laboratories) binding, confirming endothelial and/or monocytic
lineage (13, 17). The majority of the cells expressed CD11b
as shown by flow cytometry, indicating that these cells were
composed of heterogeneous populations including vascular
leukocytes (18, 19). In addition to the expression of Tie2, a
significant fraction of the attached BMMNCs expressed
Flt1, CXCR4, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β
(PDGFR-β). Weak expression of the progenitor markers such
as c-Kit and CD34 was also identified (antibody was purchased
from Beckman Coulter and BD; Supplementary Fig. S1).
Although genes expressed in endothelial cells such as Flk-1
and VE-cadherin were upregulated in the BMMNCs during 7
days of culture as compared with freshly isolated CD11b+
BMMNCs, there was a substantial induction of PDGFR-β mRNA.
The tumor-bearing mice were divided randomly into salineinfused or VPC-treated groups when PDAC tumors were established. The proangiogenic cells were prepared from BMMNCs
isolated from syngeneic mice and the transplantation was performed through the retro-orbital cavity. Initially, 104, 105, and
106 VPCs were injected into nude mice bearing KP-1N xenografts (n = 10 for each group), and the growth of tumors was
observed for up to 6 weeks. Because we observed effects of
VPC transplantation histologically when 105 to 106 cells were
injected, additional studies were then performed by transplanting larger numbers of VPCs. Tumor-bearing mice also received
VPCs or a saline injection weekly for 2 to 3 weeks at 4- to 7-day
intervals before sacrifice. To clarify whether transplanted VPCs
were indeed localized to tumors, we injected green fluorescent
protein (GFP)–labeled VPCs into mice (5 × 105 per mice) with
PDAC xenografts in some of the experiments (13).
To assess hypoxic regions, pimonidazole hydrochloride
(60 mg/kg; Hypoxyprobe-1, Millipore) was injected i.p. 1.5 hours
before killing. We harvested xenograft tumors before the lesions
reached 10 mm in diameter (the average volume was 200–300
mm3) for histologic analysis. Tumor tissues were then fixed with
zinc-fixative solution (IHC ZINC fixative, BD Pharmingen) for
24 hours at room temperature and embedded in paraffin for
immunohistochemistry. For immunofluorescence staining in
xenograft tissue, 4-μm sections were incubated with a CD31specific antibody, MEC13.3 (1:50; BD Pharmingen), overnight
at 4°C. Blood vessels were counted in 5 to 10 random viable fields
(20× objective), and the vessel area/density was quantified using
ImageJ software (version 1.38). For other immunohistochemical
studies, the following antibodies were used: anti–MIB-1 (DAKO;
1:100), anti-NG2 (Chemicon; 1:200), anti–cleaved caspase-3 (5A1E,
Cell Signaling; 1:200), and anti–CA9 (Novus; 1:100). Nuclei were

counterstained with 50 ng/mL 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(Sigma) and images were examined with a fluorescent microscope (BX-51/DP-71, Olympus).
To visualize the extracellular matrix in xenograft tumors,
tissue staining was performed using Masson's trichrome kit
(Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
In vivo vascular imaging by contrast-enhanced
ultrasound system
To visualize perfusion within tumors, an ultrasound contrast agent, Sonazoid (Daiichi-Sankyo Co. Ltd.), was administered to tumor-bearing mice (0.25 μL/kg). The vascularized
area within tumors was imaged by an ultrasound diagnostic
system (AplioXG, Toshiba Medical Systems Corp.) with a 12MHz linear probe (PLT-1204AT). The phase modulation harmonic imaging mode (transmitted/received at 5.0/10.0 MHz)
was used for the nonlinear signal extraction, and the
mechanical index was set to around 0.20. The images for
30 seconds after injection were recorded into the U.S. system
and transferred to consumer PC after the experiments.

www.aacrjournals.org

The arrival time parametric images were reconstructed by
using the dedicated prototype software programmed by C++
(20). The software reads the Audio Video Interleaving (AVI)
image obtained by the U.S. system, calculates the enhanced
intensity on the image frame by frame, and paints the colors,
which correspond to the time to arrival of the enhancement.
Because each color has the numerical value of the arrival, the
arrival time of each part will be indicated by the still image of
the resulting parametric imaging.
Quantitative real-time PCR assay
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Protect Mini kit
(QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TaqMan Gene Expression Assay primer and probe sets (Applied Biosystems) were used for quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The
primer sequences are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
Transcript levels were normalized to 18S rRNA. Results are expressed as normalized expression values (2−ΔCT) or normalized
expression relative to control cells or tissues without cell transplantation (= 2−ΔΔCT), unless otherwise stated.

Results and Discussion
Transplantation of cultured VPCs into tumor-bearing
mice induces vascular remodeling and reduces
tumor hypoxia
To determine whether cultured CD11b+ VPCs possess a
capacity to repair tumor vessels, we performed a series of investigations using spindle-shaped attached BM mononuclear
cells cultured in EGM2 medium as crude proangiogenic cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1). PDAC was selected as a model for a
hypoxic tumor to test our hypothesis that certain malignant
phenotypes associated with hypoxia may be abolished if
abnormalities of the tumor vasculature could be appropriately manipulated. Intravenous administration of 5 × 105 VPCs
into nude mice bearing KP-1N human pancreatic cancer xe-

nografts significantly increased tumor microvessel density
(Fig. 1A). The transplanted cells localized to the perivascular
area, closely associating with the tumor vasculature rather
than directly differentiating into vascular endothelial cells
(Fig. 1B). In addition, the number of GFP+ transplanted cells
was significantly attenuated at 6 weeks after transplantation,
suggesting that the ex vivo cultured VPCs may not constitute
blood vessels for long term. In contrast to the narrowed and
fragmented vasculature in control xenografts, the vessel
surface area in VPC-transplanted tumors was dramatically
increased (1.5 ± 0.9% versus 5.3 ± 1.8%; P < 0.01). The enlarged tumor vasculature seemed to be functional because
it was accompanied by reduced areas of tumor hypoxia as
represented by pimonidazole-positive areas within the tumor
(Fig. 1C). In addition, increases in vascularized (perfused)
areas within VPC-injected xenografts were observed by arrival time parametric imaging reconstructed from images by an
ultrasound diagnostic system with a 12-MHz linear probe
during injection of a contrast agent (Sonazoid) when serial
i.v. injections of 105 VPCs three times at 4-day intervals were

performed (Supplementary Fig. S2; Supplementary Materials
1 and 2), indicating a functional “reorganization/remodeling”
of the abnormal tumor vasculature.
We next confirmed whether the tumor vessels in the VPCtransplanted tumor were structurally mature. Because pericytes play an essential role in the integrity of structural
vessels, immunohistochemical staining for NG2 and CD31
was then performed (Fig. 1D). Increased numbers of CD31+
microvessels were covered with NG2+ pericytes, indicating
that the resulting tumor vasculature structurally mimicked
normal vessels with a high pericyte coverage ratio.
Similar observations were shown in genetically engineered
Pdx1-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D;p53lox/+ mice, which spontaneously develop desmoplastic PDAC (15), and undifferentiated tissues
with abundant desmoplasia were selected for histologic analysis. Poor tissue perfusion was also successfully corrected by
VPC transplantation in this mouse model (Fig. 2). Therefore,
the vascular regeneration/remodeling through the cell-mediated approach is not limited to artificial xenograft tumors but is
also capable of manipulating abnormal blood perfusion in
spontaneously developing desmoplastic PDAC tumors in mice.
Transplantation of cultured CD11b+ VPCs does not
enhance tumor growth but instead temporarily delays
the outgrowth
Because tumor outgrowth is generally dependent on
angiogenesis, we initially speculated that enhanced blood perfusion may promote tumor growth and metastasis. However,
to our surprise, the growth of PDAC xenografts was significantly inhibited when more than 105 VPCs were transplanted
(Fig. 3A). When tumor growth was observed for 6 weeks posttransplantation, the growth of xenograft tumors was temporarily slowed by VPC transplantation although they started
to regrow within 3 weeks (Fig. 3B). To determine whether this
reduction of tumor growth can also be observed in other cell
types, additional xenograft experiments were then performed
using various human cancer cell lines (Supplementary Table
S2). Serial i.v. injections of 5 × 105 VPCs were performed subsequent to xenograft establishment at 7-day intervals. A significant reduction in tumor growth was observed in other human
pancreatic cancer cells, Panc-1 and BxPC-3. Additionally,
growth inhibition of xenograft tumors was also shown in
MKN-24 (a human gastric cancer cell line) and PC-9 (a human
lung cancer cell line). Of note, enhancement of tumor growth
was not induced by VPC transplantation in cells tested and
metastatic outgrowth was not observed even in SW480 and
hypervascular HepG2 xenografts.
Oxygen and nutrients are required for any tissue including
tumors, but cancer cells can survive even in severe hypoxia
(21). It is well known that most cancer cells rely on aerobic
glycolysis, rather than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, to generate energy needed for cellular processes (22).
However, it should be noted that clinical trials have shown
that reducing tissue hypoxia either through blood transfusion or erythropoietin could be associated with an improved
response to radiotherapy and may improve the survival of
cancer patients (23). In addition, a recent study showed that
angiopoietin-1–mediated maturation of blood vessels can

www.aacrjournals.org

inhibit tumor growth through a suppression of permeability
in tumors with pericyte-rich blood vessels (24). We therefore
sought to address the question of whether the tumor microenvironment with abundant oxygen delivered by reorganized
blood vessels is favorable for tumor cells or not.
Histopathologic analysis revealed that transplantation of
cultured CD11b+ VPCs did not significantly increase areas
of necrosis (Fig. 4A). Masson's trichrome staining showed
that xenograft tumors in the VPC-transplanted mice were depleted of desmoplastic stroma, resulting in densely packed
ductal adenocarcinoma cells (Supplementary Fig. S3), and
the number of cells per area was increased by VPC transplantation, suggesting that VPCs increase the density of cells.
This could thereby facilitate the blood perfusion in PDAC indirectly. Similar observations have been made with VPC
transplantation into mouse models of acute coronary ischemia (25, 26); that is, tissue remodeling composed of extensive
fibrosis in infarct heart and cirrhotic liver could be attenuated by transplantation of BMMNCs manipulated by a similar
ex vivo differentiation protocol (27).
To directly address the effect of oxygen during reperfusion
(reoxygenation) in hypoxic tumors, we performed an in vitro

2,000 mm3 or a tumor harboring an ulcer.

assay using PDAC cells adapted to long-term hypoxic conditions under low oxygen tension (5% O2) by using a hypoxia
workstation. Although hypoxia generally downregulates cell
proliferation (28), the KP-1N human PDAC line adapted to
5% O2 (chronic hypoxia) can grow equally with a comparable
doubling time as cells cultured in normoxic conditions (20%
O2; doubling time in chronic hypoxia and normoxic conditions was 21.0 ± 2.8 and 22.8 ± 3.1 hours, respectively). However, the proliferation of the hypoxia-conditioned KP-1N cells
was significantly attenuated when the cells were placed again
under normoxic conditions (doubling time, 31.7 ± 4.8 hours;
P < 0.01; Fig. 4B). A similar observation was also shown in
primary mouse PDAC cells from Pdx1-Cre;LSL-Kras G12D ;
p53lox/+ mice (doubling time was 13.6 ± 2.5 hours in chronic
hypoxia and 16.7 ± 2.9 hours in reoxygenated cells; P < 0.05).
These results may account for the attenuated tumor growth
when the tumor vasculature was reorganized/remodeled by
the ex vivo cultured CD11b+ VPC transplantation that liberated PDAC cells from hypoxic conditions.
We therefore examined the effect of serial VPC transplantation (5 × 105 cells; 7-day intervals) on the proliferation kinetics of xenograft tumors in vivo. There was a modest but
statistically significant difference in the Ki-67 labeling index
(Fig. 4C), consistent with the growth retardation by VPC

6288

transplantation. Because staining the xenograft tissues for
Ki-67 showed a reduced proliferation of cancer cells by only 17.6%, additional immunostaining using anti–cleaved
caspase-3 was then performed. The apoptotic fraction
was markedly increased by 1.72-fold in xenograft tumors
when cultured VPCs were serially transplanted (Fig. 4C).
These results indicate that enhanced blood perfusion
may impair the ability of tumor cells to rapidly grow.
The remodeling of abnormal tumor vasculature induces reperfusion of hypoxic tissue and reduced areas of significant hypoxia (Figs. 1 and 2). This potentially leads to an increase in free
radical concentration, resulting in growth suppression
through an induction of stress-response genes (21, 29).
Transplantation of cultured CD11b+ VPCs attenuates
angiogenic cytokine production from cancer cells
during reperfusion in PDAC xenografts
VPC transplantation induced repair of the abnormal tumor vasculature and reduced tumor desmoplasia, which
could further facilitate blood perfusion. This histologic remodeling may also attenuate oxygen consumption by the microenvironment. We therefore speculated that transplantation of
cultured CD11b+ VPCs may alter the imbalance between
proangiogenic and antiangiogenic cytokines released from

Remodeling of Abnormal Tumor Vasculature by VPC

tumor cells. In general, cancer cells express excess amounts of
various proangiogenic factors, which primarily regulate the
abnormal tumor vasculature. To test this possibility, we quantified the mRNA levels of proangiogenic factors from cancer
cells in xenografts by using human-specific probes. Consistent
with the marked reduction in tumor hypoxia, the VEGF mRNA
levels were significantly attenuated (Fig. 5). Interleukin-8, another proangiogenic cytokine that can be induced by hypoxia
in cells with oncogenic Kras (30), was also strongly downregulated. Pigment epithelium–derived factor (PEDF) is a potent
angiogenic inhibitor in the pancreas, expressed by both epithelial and stromal compartments and regulated by hypoxia.
PEDF expression has been shown to be downregulated during
pancreatic tumorigenesis, at least in part playing a role in neovascularization and metastatic outgrowth in PDAC (31, 32).
Curiously, VPC transplantation restored PEDF expression in
cancer cells, which may account for not only the reduction
in aberrant tumor angiogenesis but also the inhibition of
proliferation of tumor cells.
Because Masson's trichrome staining showed that the
transplantation of cultured VPCs significantly reduced the
amount of desmoplastic stroma, we speculated that genes involved in fibrosis may also be altered. There was no significant difference in the mRNA levels of cancer cell–derived
transforming growth factor-β and osteopontin (27, 33),
known fibrosis mediators, and the precise mechanisms by
which VPC transplantation reduced PDAC desmoplasia need
to be further elucidated. However, The Ihh morphogen, but
not Shh, which plays a role in pancreatic fibrosis through an
activation of pancreatic stellate cells (34), was downregulated
by regeneration of the tumor vasculature in PDAC xenografts. There was upregulation of desmoplasia-related α2

(type I) procollagen (COL1A2) and secreted protein acidic
and rich in cysteine (SPARC) genes in tumor cells when VPCs
were transplanted; however, the levels were modest when
compared with their stromal expression, where VPC transplantation had no influence. Taken together, these data indicate that transplanted VPCs localized to hypoxic areas either
in tumors or in infarcted (ischemic) heart may have the capacity to terminate abnormal tissue remodeling including
aberrant angiogenesis.
Cancer cells released from hypoxia represent a
phenotype with less resistance to chemotherapy and
reduced stemness phenotype
Expression of carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9), one of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) target genes, has been proposed
as a marker of prolonged hypoxia (35). CA9 plays a role in
maintaining an alkaline intracellular pH and an acidic extracellular pH (36, 37) and in anchorage-independent tumor cell
growth, facilitating invasion of cancer cells into the extracellular matrix by modulating the functions of E-cadherin (38).
We therefore examined CA9 expression by immunohistochemistry in VPC-transplanted tumors (Fig. 6A). In line with
a significant reduction in pimonidazole-positive areas in xenografts receiving VPC injections, the resulting vascular remodeling also attenuated the number of CA9-positive cells
dramatically. The reduction was more prominent in viable
areas as compared with perinecrotic areas.
Hypoxia and HIFs have been shown to activate signaling
pathways that control stem cell self-renewal and multipotency (39). In addition to hematologic malignancies, solid tumors can also develop from a small number of self-renewing
transformed cells, the so-called tumor-initiating cells (40).

procedure. A, xenograft tissues were stained

viable area (bottom). Quantification of

Accumulating evidence has indicated that these rare types of
cancer cells with stemness properties can localize in a “hypoxic niche,” giving rise to resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (4). This implies that regional hypoxia plays a
fundamental role in both regulating the stemness properties
of cancer cells and diminishing therapeutic response and
that both of the hypoxia-induced phenotypes could be reversible. We therefore sought to determine whether vascular

remodeling induced by VPC transplantation may alter such
stemness and resistant phenotypes of hypoxic PDAC cells.
Xenograft tumors were used to specifically analyze gene
expression in cancer cells rather than stromal cells, using
human-specific probes for TaqMan quantitative PCR assays
(Fig. 6B). There was a significant reduction in CA9 mRNA
levels in VPC-transplanted xenografts, consistent with a
massive reduction in CA9 immunostaining (Fig. 6A).

Remodeling of Abnormal Tumor Vasculature by VPC

Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4), one of the
stemness genes that can induce pluripotency in differentiated cells (41), was downregulated by 22.9%. Because HIF-2α
can directly regulate Oct-4, it is therefore possible that hypoxia mediates its effects on stem cell function by altering the
stemness genes (42). Considering that Oct-4 is involved in tumor progression and motility (43), downregulation of Oct-4
would be beneficial to control the malignant phenotype
caused by hypoxia. Additionally, the expression levels of
MDR1 (ABCB1) and ABCG2, genes that play a major role in
“resistance” to chemotherapy, were also dramatically downregulated by VPC transplantation (Fig. 6B).
Gemcitabine is the standard chemotherapeutic reagent for
locally advanced or metastatic PDAC (44), and a recent study
performed on cultured PDAC cells indicated that human
equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1) is the major
transporter for gemcitabine, and increased hENT1 abundance facilitates efficient cellular entry of the drug and confers its increased cytotoxicity (14, 45). We found that there
was a 2-fold induction of hNET1 mRNA in tumor cells when
xenograft-bearing mice were treated with cultured CD11b+
VPCs, consistent with the observation that hENT1 could be
downregulated by hypoxia (46). Therefore, although we did
not observe any differences in dCK mRNA, another important intracellular modulator of gemcitabine, PDACs with normalized blood vessels by VPC transplantation may be more
sensitive to gemcitabine as compared with hypoxic tumors.
Taken together, these data indicate that remodeling of an unstable tumor vasculature leads to a significant reduction in
expression of genes associated with the stemness of cancer
cells as well as an increase in sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy. We are currently testing this hypothesis by
studying a combination of chemotherapeutic agents such
as gemcitabine and VPC transplantation.

blood flow within tumor xenografts when embryonic stem
cell–derived VPCs were transplanted, and no enhancement
of tumor growth was observed (50). In the current study,
we observed that a considerable number of transplanted
CD11b+VPCs localized to the perivascular area, and therefore
they did not seem to induce angiogenesis (vasculogenesis) by
directly differentiating into vascular endothelial cells. Those
transplanted cells have been shown to promote neovascularization indirectly through paracrine stimulation/stabilization
of neovessels (11). We found that, in addition to VEGF and
angiopoietin-1, the cultured VPCs also express significant levels of antiangiogenic factors (51), suggesting their potential
role in terminating aberrant neovascularization. Further
studies are required to address the precise mechanisms by
which these ex vivo cultured BMMNCs influence the chaotic
blood vessels and tumor microenvironment. Our study also
implies that the potential risk of enhancing tumor growth
may not be an issue during cell therapy using progenitors,
at least if cultured (manipulated) cells are used.
Collectively, we have identified an alternative approach to
regulate the abnormal tumor vasculature. Tumor vessels remodeled by ex vivo cultured CD11b+ VPCs exhibited maturation of the “abnormal” vasculature, resulting in a significant
reduction in tumor hypoxia. The cancer cells seemed to have
a distinct phenotype in the reperfused/reoxygenated microenvironment with decreased stemness-related gene expressions.
This approach may not only attenuate innate resistance to
chemotherapy/radiotherapy but also potentially improve the
delivery of anticancer drugs to hypoxic tumors.

Conclusion
BM cells are thought to play a role in tumor development
(47), and various types of BM-derived hematopoietic cells
have been observed to closely associate with the tumor neovasculature (18, 48). Indeed, a small number of BM-derived
progenitor cells were shown to incorporate into the lumen
of a growing vasculature where they differentiate into endothelial cells in a mouse metastasis model (49). The BMderived cells generally have been thought to augment the
malignant phenotype of tumor; however, our data support
the notion that certain immature myeloid cells from the
BM may have the capacity to repair an abnormal microenvironment if they are appropriately differentiated ex vivo. In
support of our results, others have also shown increases in
