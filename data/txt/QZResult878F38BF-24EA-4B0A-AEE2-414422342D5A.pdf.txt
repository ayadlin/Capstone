BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children, occurs less commonly
in infants. Historically, poorer outcomes have been reported for infants diagnosed with RMS than for older children.
METHODS: The authors analyzed the characteristics, treatment administered, outcomes, and patterns of failure for
infants aged < 1 year with nonmetastatic RMS who received multimodal therapy on Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma
Study (IRS) protocols IRS-IV, D9602, and D9803. RESULTS: Seventy-six infants with nonmetastatic RMS were treated
on the 3 protocols from 1991 to 2005. Their median age was 7.4 months (range, 0.1-12 months). Tumor histology
included embryonal (57%), alveolar (21%), and undifferentiated sarcoma/other (22%). A parameningeal primary tumor
site was less common in this infant cohort (3%) than in all patients who were treated on IRS-IV (25%). The estimated
5-year failure-free survival and overall survival rates (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 57% (95% CI, 44%-67%) and
76% (95% CI, 65%-85%), respectively, for infants compared with 81% (95% CI, 79%-83%) and 87% (95% CI, 85%-89%),
respectively, for children ages 1 to 9 years. Twenty-three of 32 infants with treatment failure had local recurrence/progression with distant failure (n ¼ 3) or without distant failure (n ¼ 20). The overall local failure rate was 30%. The median time to treatment failure was 13 months. The failure-free survival rate was worse for infants who had IRS Group
III tumors and for those who received less than protocol-recommended radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Infants
with RMS appeared to have worse outcomes than older patients, in part because of high rates of local failure. The
authors concluded that concerns regarding morbidity in infants and reluctance to use aggressive local control measC 2011 American Cancer Society.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a malignancy of mesenchymal cell origin that primarily occurs in children and

young adults. Although the majority of cases of RMS are diagnosed in children aged < 6 years of age,1 RMS is uncommon
in infants. Previous studies have demonstrated that age is a prognostic factor in RMS, and a poorer outcome is reported
for infants than for older children.2-4 Because there is no clear evidence that the biology of RMS is different in infants, the
reason for their worse outcome is unclear. A potential explanation for the inferior outcome of infants may be less aggressive
local therapy. Concerns regarding the morbidity and long-term adverse effects of surgery or radiation therapy (RT) may
lead treating physicians and parents to omit or reduce local therapy for infants. Alternatively, infants may tolerate intensive
systemic therapy less well. Higher therapy-related mortality rates have been observed in infants with Wilms tumor, and
the risk of hepatopathy is greater in younger children with RMS.5,6 Therefore, reduced doses of chemotherapy often are
administered.
The Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) Group (IRSG) has conducted consecutive, multi-institutional
clinical trials to improve the outcome of children with RMS.7-12 In this report, we describe the characteristics, outcome,
prognostic factors, and patterns of failure for infants with nonmetastatic RMS treated on the fourth and fifth IRS studies

(IRS-IV and IRS-V). We specifically evaluated adherence
to protocol-recommended RT as a prognostic factor for
local failure and failure-free survival (FFS).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The study population consisted of infants with nonmetastatic RMS who were treated on intergroup RMS studies,
IRS-IV11 and IRS-V.7,12 IRS-V was conducted through
the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) as study D9803
for ‘‘intermediate-risk’’ RMS and study D9602 for ‘‘lowrisk’’ RMS. Informed consent was obtained at the original
time of enrollment on 1 of the IRS studies from the
parents/guardians of all infants who were included in this
analysis.
All patients in this analysis were aged < 1 year at the
time of diagnosis. The IRS studies assigned a presurgical
stage based on tumor site, size, clinical lymph node
involvement, and the presence or absence of metastases.13
A postsurgical ‘‘group’’ also was assigned to all tumors
based on IRS classification.9 Group I included patients
with localized tumors that were completely excised with
no microscopic residual disease. Group II included
patients who had grossly resected tumors with microscopic residual disease and/or resected regional disease
with involved lymph nodes. Group III consisted of
patients who had gross residual disease after resection or
biopsy only. Group IV consisted of patients with metastatic disease.
Treatment
Patients on all 3 protocols received multimodal therapy,
including chemotherapy with or without surgery and/or
RT as assigned by protocol according to IRS stage and
group. The outcome for patients who were treated on
IRS-IV was similar to that for patients who were treated
on IRS-V,7,11 which allowed us to conduct a pooled analysis of data from both studies. Treatment by study is summarized below.
IRS-IV enrolled patients from 1991 to 1997.11
Patients without metastatic disease were randomized to
receive vincristine and dactinomycin with cyclophosphamide (VAC), ifosfamide (VAI), or etoposide (VIE).
Patients with Group III tumors were randomized to
receive either conventional RT (50.4 grays [Gy] in 28 1.8Gy fractions) or hyperfractionated RT (59.4 Gy in 54 1.1Gy fractions twice daily). The COG study D9803 enrolled
patients with ‘‘intermediate-risk’’ RMS from 1999 to

3494

2005.7 Eligible patients included those with stage 1
through 3/Group I through III alveolar RMS and undifferentiated sarcoma, those with stage 2 and 3/Group III
embryonal RMS, and patients aged < 10 years with stage
4/Group IV embryonal RMS. Three infants with stage 4/
Group IV embryonal RMS who were treated on D9803
were excluded from this analysis. Patients were randomized to receive either VAC chemotherapy or VAC alternating with vincristine, topotecan, and cyclophosphamide
(VTC). The D9602 study enrolled patients with ‘‘lowrisk’’ RMS (stage 1 through 3/Group I and II with embryonal or botryoid histology) from 1997 to 2004.12 Patients
received either VAC or VA chemotherapy with or without
RT based on their pretreatment stage and group.
Each protocol recommended that infants receive
50% of prescribed chemotherapy doses in the initial phase
of chemotherapy with escalation to 75% and then to
100% in subsequent phases if no significant toxicity
occurred. Chemotherapy doses were calculated by weight
(kilograms) or by body surface area (meters squared),
depending on the protocol and the chemotherapeutic
agent.
RT was assigned for all patients with Group II or
Group III tumors and for patients with Group I alveolar
histology. Patients with Group III tumors, Group II
tumors, and Group I alveolar/undifferentiated histology
received RT at doses of 50.4 or 59.4 Gy, 41.4 Gy, and 36
Gy, respectively.
Study Design
We analyzed data regarding clinical features for infants
aged < 1 year compared with older patient cohorts that
were treated on the same studies. We also assessed the
delivery of chemotherapy and RT and the operative procedures performed. Initial and second-look operations as
well as outcome with regard to loss of cosmesis, loss of
organ function, and resection of vital structures were evaluated. ‘‘Loss of cosmesis’’ was defined as any resection
that resulted in a noticeable change in appearance, including resection of the face/head/neck. ‘‘Loss of function’’
was defined as any resection that resulted in the permanent loss of a functional organ (eg, bladder). ‘‘Resection of
vital structures’’ was defined as removal of at least some
portion of a critical structure (eg, ureter, kidney, colon)
that was associated with morbidity with or without ‘‘loss
of function.’’ Adherence to protocol-specified RT was analyzed, and the proportion of patients who received less
than prescribed radiation was determined. RT was classified as not ‘‘as specified by protocol’’ if 1) RT was

withheld despite protocol guidelines specifying that the
patient should receive RT based on IRS stage and group,
and 2) there was a major deviation from the protocolspecified dose and/or target volumes. Lack of adherence
to assigned fractionation (conventional or hyperfractionated) was not considered a major deviation. With regard
to chemotherapy, mean percentages of delivered to calculated doses were determined for each agent in each
‘‘phase’’ of treatment. FFS and overall survival (OS) were
determined for infants and compared with older age
groups that were treated on the same studies. FFS was
assessed and compared by group and according to whether
or not protocol-specified RT was received. Sites of failure
and the time to failure were determined.
Statistical Analysis
Patient characteristics were compared across cohorts using
the Fisher exact test. FFS and OS were estimated using
Kaplan-Meier life table analysis14 and were compared
between age cohorts, by group, and by RT received using
the log-rank test.15

RESULTS
Patient and Disease Characteristics
Among 1843 patients with nonmetastatic RMS who were
enrolled on IRS-IV, D9602, and D9803, 76 patients
(4%) were aged < 1 year at the time of diagnosis (IRS-IV,
n ¼ 41; D9602, n ¼ 20; D9803, n ¼ 15). Characteristics
of the study population compared with patients ages 1 to
9 years and patients aged  10 years with nonmetastatic
RMS listed shown in Table 1. Thirty-one infants (41%)
were girls. The median age at diagnosis was 7.4 months
(range, 0.1-12 months). Thirteen patients (17%) were
aged < 3 months, and 4 patients (5%) were aged < 1
month at the time of diagnosis.
Forty-three infants (57%) had tumors with embryonal histology, and 16 (21%) had alveolar histology. The
remaining 17 patients (22%) had ‘‘other’’ histology,
which included undifferentiated sarcoma and ectomesenchymoma. Infants had a greater proportion of undifferentiated sarcoma than older patients. The distribution of
primary tumor sites differed for infants compared with
older patients (P< .0001). Infants had a lower incidence
of parameningeal tumors (4%) and a higher proportion of
tumors in the trunk/abdomen (including the chest wall,
paraspinous region, and retroperitoneum).
Distribution according to IRS stage, tumor size,
lymph node status, and T-classification differed statisti-

cally across the 3 age categories. Similar to the older age
groups, more than half of infants had Group III tumors
after an initial operative procedure.
Treatment Outcome
Thirty-two of 76 infants experienced treatment failure,
and 20 died. Eighteen patients died from progressive disease, and 2 died from treatment-related toxicity. Outcome
for the patients with nonmetastatic RMS who were
treated on IRS-IV, D9602, and D9803 differed by age at
diagnosis (Fig. 1). The estimated 5-year FFS (95% confidence intervals [CI]) for infants was 57% (95% CI, 44%67%) compared with 81% (95% CI, 79%-93%) for
patients ages 1 to 9 years and 68% (95% CI, 63%-72%)
for patients aged  10 years (P < .001). The 5-year OS
rates for patients aged < 1 year, ages 1 to 9 years, and aged
 10 years were 76% (95% CI, 65%-85%), 87% (95%
CI, 85%-89%), and 75% (95% CI, 71%-79%), respectively (P < .001).
Outcome was similar for infants aged < 3 months
compared with older infants. Five failures were observed
among 13 infants aged < 3 months. Outcome varied by
tumor histology but not by other clinical parameters, such
as tumor site, tumor size, T-classification, and lymph
node status (Table 2). The subset of infants with alveolar
histology had a high risk of failure with an estimated 5year FFS rate of 22% (95% CI, 5%-45%) and a 5-year
OS rate of 65% (95% CI, 35%-85%). Infants in this
study who had undifferentiated sarcoma had outcomes
similar to those observed among those with embryonal
RMS.
Outcome by IRS Group
Infants with Group III tumors had a significantly greater
probability of poor outcome than those with Group I or
II tumors (Fig. 2). The Estimated 5-year FFS rate for
infants with Group III tumors was 39% (95% CI, 24%53%) compared with 69% (95% CI, 37%-87%) for
infants with Group II tumors and 89% (95% CI, 62%97%) for infants with Group I tumors (P ¼ .0022). The
estimated 5-year OS rates were 60% (95% CI, 44%74%), 92% (95% CI, 57%-99%), and 100% for patients
with Group III, Group II, and Group I tumors, respectively (P ¼ .012).

in 14 patients. Of the 14 infants who underwent second
complete excisions, 6 patients also received RT. Five of 14
patients who underwent second complete excisions,
including 2 who also received RT, experienced treatment
failure (3 local failures, 1 distant failure, and 1 death from
toxicity).

Operative therapy resulted in resection of vital structures in 18 of the 76 infants (24%) with resulting loss of
organ function in 17 (22%). An additional 5 patients
(8%) had loss of cosmesis. Resection of vital structures
and loss of organ function occurred more frequently in
patients who underwent complete resection. However, 6
of 36 patients who never underwent complete excision
did undergo operations that resulted in resection of vital
structures and loss of function.

Radiation therapy

Thirty-three infants (43%) received RT (3 with
Group I tumors, 10 with Group II tumors, and 20 with
Group III tumors). RT often was withheld by local investigators or because of parent refusal. Therefore, deviations
from protocol-specified RT also were analyzed for 72
infants who had complete data available. Data regarding
target volume and dose were not available for 4 patients.
Thirty of 72 infants (42%) had major deviations from
protocol-specified RT dose or volume. This group of 30
infants included 20 patients with Group II tumors, Group

doses administered (with 100% defined as the prescribed
dose for children aged > 1 year) by phase of treatment for
alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide), vincristine, and dactinomycin. Doses were escalated successfully for the majority of infants. In the final phase of
therapy, on average, infants received 83% of prescribed
doses of alkylating agents and vincristine and 89% of prescribed doses of dactinomycin. Fifteen of 43 patients
(35%) received at least 90% of the prescribed alkylator
dose in the final phase.

developed distant metastases, 3 had local and metastatic
progression, and 2 died from toxicity (Table 5). The site
of recurrence/progression was not reported for 1 patient.
The mean and median times to failure were 17 months
and 13 months, respectively (range, 1-72 months). Fifteen
patients experienced treatment failure within 1 year of diagnosis, and 8 treatment failures occurred within 6
months.
The overall incidence of local failure (defined as any
local failure with or without failure at other sites) in this
infant cohort was 30% compared with 13% for all
patients who were treated on IRS-IV, D9602, and
D9803. Eighteen of 23 patients with local failure had
Group III tumors. The rate of local failure for infants
with Group III tumors was 42% compared with 17% for
all Group III patients on IRS-IV, D9602, and D9803.
Among the 18 infants with Group III tumors who had
local failure, 6 patients had received RT, 1 patient underwent a delayed complete resection without RT, and 11
patients received no local therapy.

DISCUSSION
The management of infants with RMS remains a challenge, particularly regarding local therapy. Previous studCancer

ies have demonstrated that, after adjusting for other
features, age < 1 year at diagnosis remains a significant
adverse prognostic factor.3,11 The outcome for our cohort
of infants was similar to what was reported by Joshi et al
for infants who were treated on IRS-IV (5-year FFS rate,
53%) and by Ferrari et al for infants who were treated on
a the Italian Cooperative Group trial (5-year FFS rate,
42%).2,3 Although there has been a significant improvement in FFS for children with RMS over sequential IRS
studies, the same improvement in outcome has not been
observed for infants.7-12
The reason for the poorer outcome of infants
remains unclear. In adolescents, an increased risk of failure can be explained by a higher frequency of alveolar histology and tumors in unfavorable sites. Conversely, our
cohort of infants did not have a higher incidence of these
known adverse prognostic factors. A previous analysis of
IRS-III and IRS-IV demonstrated that outcomes were
worse for infants compared with older patients within
each histologic subtype.16 Other factors currently used in
risk stratification, including IRS stage and group, were
similar in infants compared with older patients in our
study.
Because there is no clear evidence of different biology of RMS in infants, the receipt of less aggressive treatment must be considered as a possible reason for poorer
outcome. Although the incidence of Group III tumors
among infants was similar that among older children, the
outcome for these infants was significantly worse, with a
5-year FFS rate of 39%. In comparison, the 3-year FFS
rate for all patients with Group III tumors who were
treated on IRS-IV was 73%.11 Ragab et al also reported
inferior survival for infants with Group III tumors (3-year
OS rate, 41%) who were treated on IRS-I and IRS-II, but
they observed no difference in survival for other groups
compared with older children.17 Similar to what we

observed in our current study, Ragab et al observed a
higher local recurrence rate for infants with Group III
RMS (29%) than for older patients who were treated on
the same studies (11%). The high incidence of local failure in our infants and in the cohort reported by Ragab et
al suggests the possibility of less aggressive local control.
In our cohort, more than half of infants with Group III
tumors had major deviations from protocol-specified RT,
and the majority of infants with Group III tumors and
local failure had received no RT at all. This finding is consistent with the study by Ferarri et al, in which RT was
withheld in 54% of infants with RMS who met protocol
guidelines to receive radiation.2 Accordingly, a high rate
of local failure was observed in their infant cohort, and
85% of treatment failures were local.2
Clearly, there is a dilemma in administering local
therapy to infants. There are valid concerns regarding the
long-term morbidity of RT in infants and young children.18 Depending on the location and size of the tumor,
local control with an operative procedure can be equally
problematic. However, our data suggest that, without
adequate local control, the risk of local failure is very high.
In an analysis of patients with Group II RMS, Million
et al observed a similar high rate of local recurrence associated with deviations from protocol guidelines.19 However, reasonable local control rates can be achieved with
appropriate RT, even in very young children.20 Finding
the balance between long-term effects, quality of life, and
the potential for cure is difficult. Therefore, treatment
decisions often need to be individualized for each particular patient. Our observation that OS was not worse for the
infants with Group III RMS who had RT withheld suggests that many of these patients may be salvaged after
local recurrence. Current COG guidelines for local therapy in children aged < 24 months allow for the individualization of treatment to permit careful balancing of longterm morbidity against the increased risk of local failure
and death.
There is a paucity of pharmacokinetic data in infants
to help guide dosing of chemotherapeutic agents.21
Because of higher mortality in infants on IRS-I who
received full-dose chemotherapy, initial chemotherapy in
subsequent studies has started at 50% of the calculated
doses for older children with dose escalation as tolerated.9
In our infant cohort, chemotherapy was tolerated relatively well, and doses were escalated successfully for most
patients. The rate of death from toxicity was only 3%. It is
unclear whether the lower intensity of initial chemotherapy contributed to the inferior outcome for infants in our

3500

study. However, with improvements in supportive care
and monitoring, this degree of chemotherapy dose reduction for infants may no longer be necessary. Increasing
chemotherapy intensity potentially could contribute to
the successful prevention of local failure.22 Data from a
current COG study evaluating the pharmacokinetics and
pharmacogenetics of vincristine and dactinomycin in children (including infants) will help guide the dosing of these
agents in future trials.23
In summary, our results corroborate previous studies
in infants with RMS and suggest that local control is critical to successful treatment. Although achieving local control in infants with solid tumors remains difficult,
advancement of surgical techniques and improved methods for delivering highly conformal RT are necessary to
overcome this challenge. In addition, the development of
novel systemic agents and the incorporation of these
agents into treatment plans should help to improve the
outcome for infants with RMS.
