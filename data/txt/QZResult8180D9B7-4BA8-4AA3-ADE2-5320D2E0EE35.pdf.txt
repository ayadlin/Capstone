ABSTRACT
To systematically review the safety and efficacy of lenvatinib in the treatment of
patients, we retrieved all the relevant clinical trials on the adverse events (AEs) and
survival outcomes of lenvatinib through PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science
and Cochrane Collaboration's Central register of controlled trial. Fourteen eligible
studies involving a total of 978 patients were included in our analysis. The most
common all-grade AEs observed in patients treated with lenvatinib were hematuria
(56.6%), fatigue (52.2%) and decreased appetite (50.5%). The most frequently
observed grade ≥3 AEs were thrombocytopenia (25.4%), hypertension (17.7%)
and edema peripheral (15.5%). The incidences of both all-grade and high-grade
hypertension were significantly increased. Meanwhile, the controlled trial suggested
that progression free survival (PFS) was significantly longer in the lenvatinib group
than the placebo group. Subgroup analyses showed that mean PFS for renal cell
carcinoma was 10.933±1.828 months (95% CI 7.350-14.515, p < 0.001), and that
for thyroid cancer was 18.344±0.083 months (95% CI 18.181-18.506, p < 0.001).
In conclusion, lenvatinib is an effective agent in thyroid cancer. Early monitoring and
effective management of side effects are crucial for the safe use of this drug.

RET [5, 6]. With its anti-angiogenic activity, and a direct
effect on tumor cells by preventing relevant signaling
pathways [6–8], lenvatinib has been observed to have
promising effects in clinical trials for thyroid cancer [9,
10]. In February 2015, US FDA has approved lenvatinib
for the treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic,
progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated
thyroid cancer (RR-DTC) [9].
Lenvatinib has brought clinical benefits for patients,
but adverse events (AEs) are inevitable such as hypertension,
fatigue, proteinuria, nausea, decreased weight and abdominal
pain, which may decrease the quality of life of patients and
influence their acceptance of treatment [11, 12]. Therefore,
we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate various AEs and
clinical benefits of lenvatinib.

INTRODUCTION
Angiogenesis is critical for the local invasion and
progression of tumor cells [1]. The aberrant formation and
proliferation of blood vessels is due to an imbalance in
pro- and anti-angiogenic factors, with the first weighing
more [2]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
fibroblast growth factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are
several positive regulators of angiogenesis [3]. Over
the last decade, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) have been developed and approved in clinical
oncology practice [4].
Lenvatinib (E7080) is an oral, multi-targeted
tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR and

additional unpublished trials were added to the literature
search results. A flow diagram of the trial selection process
is provided in Figure 1.

Literature search results
We ran an initial broad search that yielded 422
unique articles after deletion of duplicates. After title and
abstract screening, 344 were excluded since they were
narrative review articles or interviews, or completely not
associated with clinical assessment of lenvatinib. Forty
were further excluded for they were conference abstracts
based on published clinical trials, leaving 38 potentially
relevant studies for full review. After estimating the
full texts of these articles, 24 articles were ruled out for
insufficient information. Ultimately, 14 eligible studies
[13–26] involving a total of 978 patients met our metaanalysis criteria. Two articles [22, 26] with the same
first author which had different study designs were both
included in our study, one was a phase II trial, and the
other was a phase III, randomized multicenter study. No

Study characteristics
Of the studies that were included in the final
analysis, 3 studies were based on thyroid cancer
patients, 5 evaluated advanced solid tumors, 1 evaluated
non-small-cell lung cancer, 1 was based on melanoma,
2 were performed on metastatic renal cell carcinoma,
1 was on advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and 1
on healthy adults. Schlumberger M [22] compared
lenvatinib with placebo in radioiodine-refractory thyroid
cancer patients, and Motzer RJ [19] used lenvatinib—
either in combination with everolimus or as a single
agent in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
The characteristics of each trial are summarized in
Table 1.

Adverse drug reactions analyses

Survival outcomes and subgroup analysis

To evaluate the safety of lenvatinib, we calculated
the rates of all-grade and grade 3 or more serious adverse
events in the overall population. In single-arm trials with
all-grade AEs, homogeneity existed in upper abdominal
pain, arthralgia, constipation and peripheral edema etc.,
which were further analysed with a fixed-effects model
(Figure 2a, Table 2). Others were analysed using a
random-effects model (Figure 2b, Table 2). Hematuria
(56.6%, 95% CI 0.193-0.877), fatigue (52.2%, 95%
CI 0.384-0.657), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia
syndrome (47.2%, 95% CI 0.201-0.761), hypertension
(47.0%, 95% CI 0.354-0.589) and diarrhea (46.2%, 95%
CI 0.362-0.605) were common in a random-effects model
(Figure 2b, Table 2). Increased alanine aminotransferase
occurred in 42% of the patients using a fixed-effects model
(42.0%, 95% CI 0.294-0.556). The most frequent grade ≥
3 treatment-related adverse events were thrombocytopenia
(25.4%, 95% CI 0.055-0.665, random model),
hypertension (17.7%, 95% CI 0.102-0.289, random
model), peripheral edema (15.5%, 95% CI 0.020-0.622,
random model) and increased aspartate aminotransferase
(12.6%, 95% CI 0.061-0.242, fixed model) (Figure 2c, 2d,
Table 2).

The efficacy analysis of lenvatinib was mainly based
on the controlled trial of lenvatinib in patients with thyroid
cancer [22]. The median progression-free survival was
18.3 months in the lenvatinib group and 3.6 months in the
placebo group (hazard ratio for progression or death 0.21,
99% CI 0.14-0.31, P < 0.001). In addition, Motzer RJ [19]
reported that median PFS was 7.4 months (95% CI 5.610.2) for single-agent lenvatinib in patients with metastatic
renal cell carcinoma and 5.5 months (95% CI 3.5-7.1) for
single-agent everolimus, representing the significantly
prolonged PFS of lenvatinib compared with everolimus
alone (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-0.98, p = 0.048). Seven trials
[13, 15, 16, 19, 22, 25, 26] reported encouraging response
rates, median time to response, or PFS observed in patients
with different types of tumors, demonstrating the antitumour efficacy of lenvatinib (Table 3). We further carried
out subgroup analyses according to tumor types. Mean
PFS for renal cell carcinoma was 10.933 ± 1.828 months
(95% CI 7.350-14.515, p < 0.001), and that for thyroid
cancer was 18.344±0.083 months (95% CI 18.181-18.506,
p < 0.001) (Table 4). Further large-scale studies are still
needed to assess the PFS of patients with melanoma and
non-small-cell lung cancer.

Risk of bias and quality assessment

suggest that patients who were administered lenvatinib
should be monitored for high blood pressure, and managed
with antihypertensive drugs or dose reductions when
necessary.
Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia was experienced in
about a quarter of patients. Through binding to PDGFR,
PDGF promotes the recovery of platelets and the formation
of bone marrow colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte [33,
34], thus the inhibition of PDGFR by lenvatinib might
cause thrombocytopenia. Hematopoietic growth factors
and transfusions [35] could be used to deal with persistent
toxicities on platelets, but the effects of them on tumor
cells remain to be explored.
In February 2015, US FDA has approved lenvatinib
for the treatment of radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancer
[9] based on the randomized controlled trial [22] included
in our analysis. We find a similar mean PFS (18.344±0.083
months, 95% CI 18.181-18.506, p < 0.001) for thyroid
cancer in our pooled analysis. However, our results
of adverse events (Figure 4a, 4b) are different, since
the relatively larger sample size may allow us to better
determine the AE values. Survival outcomes of other
tumors are mainly based on phase I and phase II trials, and
more subsequent randomized, controlled phase III trials
are needed.
The dose of lenvatinib administered in patients with
solid tumors varied in different situations, but in 8 [15,
16, 18–20, 22, 23, 26] of the 14 included studies, patients
received lenvatinib at a daily dose of 24 mg per day in
28-day cycles, and two studies [18, 20] demonstrated that
the 24-mg QD dose of lenvatinib was determined to be

The risk of bias and quality assessments of the
included studies are outlined in Figure 3a, 3b. Overall, the
quality of the studies was satisfactory.

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to evaluate both the safety and efficacy of the novel
antitumor agent lenvantinib in different types of tumors
systematically. The adverse events of lenvatinib were
tyrosine kinase inhibitor-related and were also seen in
other TKIs. In one meta-analysis [27], the VEGFRTKIs group (cediranib and axitinib) was associated
with higher rates of diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension
and thrombocytopenia compared with bevacizumab.
Vandetanib [28], a dual VEGFR and EGFR inhibitor,
yielded an improvement in PFS but more frequent grade
3 or greater hypertension. Although the incidence of
hematuria was high, most people experienced low grade
(grade 0) hematuria.
It should be noted that lenvatinib was associated
with a significantly increased risk in all-grade (47.0%)
and high-grade (17.7%) hypertension. The mechanism of
lenvatinib-associated hypertension has not been clarified,
and may be due to a possible perturbation of endothelial
cell function in patients treated with VEGF-targeting

tolerable with encouraging anti-tumor activity in patients
with solid tumors.
The heterogeneity in our analysis could arise from
different tumor types, the very heterogeneous study
population with pre-treated disease and the ethnicity
difference. In addition, there are several limitations of
our study. Firstly, because lenvatinib is a relatively new
drug, reports about it are few and are mostly phase I and
II studies. Secondly, only one study provided the overall
survival data, so prolonged follow-ups are needed. Thirdly,
we did not perform subgroup analysis of melanoma and
non-small-cell lung cancer because of lack of enough
information.
In conclusion, lenvatinib has clinically meaningful
benefits in survival outcomes of patients with thyroid
cancer. The pooled analyses suggest that patients should
be monitored for potential thrombocytopenia and
increases in blood pressure, and dose reductions or delays
or antihypertensive drugs are needed accordingly. Correct
estimates of treatment-related toxicities and the efficacy
of lenvatinib are fundamental to provide appropriate
guidance and to conduct ongoing trials.

duplicated studies by comparing author lists, publication
year, and the main contents if necessary. Articles with
the same author(s) or medical center(s) were carefully
reviewed and discussed for eligibility.
Data extracted from all eligible articles included the
first author, year of publication, sample size, study phase,
tumor type, treatment regime, progression-free survival
(PFS), hazard ratio (HR) and adverse events. ADRs were
graded using the National Cancer Institute (Washington,
DC, USA) Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0.

Data analysis
We used patients' all-grade and grade ≥ 3 Common
Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events (CTCAE) counts to
calculate the incidence rates of AEs and the corresponding
95% confidence intervals (CIs). I-squared was calculated
to test heterogeneity of the studies, and I2 > 50% and P
≤ 0.1 indicated strong heterogeneity between the studies.
All the analysis was carried out using the software
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) program 2
(Biostat, Englewood, NJ) and Review manager 5.3
(Copenhagen, Sweden).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Risk of bias and quality assessment

Search strategy

To evaluate the risk of bias and quality of the
studies, QUADAS-2 was used as a systematic review
assessment method, which consisted of four key domains:
patient selection, index test, reference standard and flow
and timing [36]. Risk of bias was rated as high/low/
unclear. The assessment was measured using Review
Manager 5.3 (Copenhagen, Sweden).

We performed a literature search of PubMed,
Medline, Embase, Web of Science and The Cochrane
Library for all the relevant clinical trials on the safety and
efficacy of lenvatinib (until April 26, 2016, 201). In order
to ensure the completeness of the results, we expanded
the search scope by using the search terms “lenvatinib”
or “E7080” or “lenvima”. We also carried out further
searches for relevant unpublished trials in the clinical
trial registry (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). Papers in all
languages were sought and translated where appropriate to
reduce the chances of bias.

angiogenesis-dependent. J Pathol. 2004; 202: 5-13.

To be included in the analysis, patients must be
diagnosed with histologically confirmed tumors, survival
outcomes and toxicities were mandatory to be reported.
All phase clinical trials were eligible for inclusion if
they evaluated the side effects and efficacy of lenvatinib.
Studies were excluded if they did not provide enough
data for toxicities and survival outcomes. They were also
excluded for which full-text reports were not available.
