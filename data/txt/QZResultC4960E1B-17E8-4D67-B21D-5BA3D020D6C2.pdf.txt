ABSTRACT
Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an aggressive malignancy and long-term
survival remains unsatisfactory for patients with metastatic and recurrent disease.
Repurposing the anti-malarial drug dihydroartemisinin (DHA) has been proved to
possess potent antitumor effect on various cancers. However, the effects of DHA in
preventing the invasion of NSCLC cells have not been studied. In the present study, we
determined the inhibitory effects of DHA on invasion and migration and the possible
mechanisms involved using A549 and H1975 cells. DHA inhibited in vitro migration and
invasion of NSCLC cells even in low concentration with little cytotoxicity. Additionally,
low concentration DHA also inhibited Warburg effect in NSCLC cells. Mechanically, DHA
negatively regulates NF-κB signaling to inhibit the GLUT1 translocation. Blocking the
NF-κB signaling largely abolishes the inhibitory effects of DHA on the translocation
of GLUT1 to the plasma membrane and the Warburg effect. Furthermore, GLUT1
knockdown significantly decreased the inhibition of invasion, and migration by DHA.
Our results suggested that DHA can inhibit metastasis of NSCLC by targeting glucose
metabolism via inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway and DHA may deserve further
investigation in NSCLC treatment.

no available cure for patients with advanced disease [4-7].
Therefore, inhibition of tumor metastasis is important in
clinical practice.
DHA is likewise the active metabolite of all
artemisinin compounds (artemisinin, artesunate,
artemether, etc.) and nearly about 5 times more potent than
artemisinin against malaria, Plasmodium falciparum [810]. Previous studies with DHA focused on its antimalarial
abilities, while gradually its effective anticancer activity
has been recognized as well. Previous researches have

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is not only the most common malignant
cancer but also the main cause of mortality by cancer
globally. Moreover, there are almost 80% of cancer
mortality in lung cancer occurred in one of predominant
histological subtypes, non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) [1-3]. Although a variety of therapies have been
considerably improved in the past few years, invasion and
metastasis still enormously limit treatment options, with

reported that DHA has been discovered function in
inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis
by downregulating cyclin D1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, caspase, and
VEGF, while upregulating P21, P27 and Bax in a series
of cancer cell lines could be effected [11-14]. DHA was
also applied to breast cancer-induced mouse osteolysis
mode, that DHA can inhibit breast tumor-induced
osteolysis via restraining the invasion and migration by
regulating AKT signaling pathway [15]. Similarly, our
recent studies indicated that DHA restrain glucose uptake.
Furthermore, it can induce apoptosis by cooperation with
glycolysis inhibitor in NSCLC cells [16]. Interestingly,
a recent popular study reported that DHA reduces both
the incidence and the risk of metastasis in osteosarcoma
and colon cancer [17-19]. Even though DHA has been
confirmed wide usefulness in treatment for many diseases,
there is no evidence at the cellular level or in animal
models for such an effect of DHA on NSCLC metastasis
[20-22]. Moreover, a distinguished feature of various
tumor cells is elevated aerobic glycolysis and increased
glucose uptake. This metabolic reprogramming, known as
the Warburg effect, provides an advantage for growing of
tumor cells even in regions with hypoxia. Metastasis of
cancer cells regulates by changes of glucose metabolism
through high glucose uptake, high lactate formation, low
extracellular pH and reduction of intratumoral pH [23-26].
In this paper, we discovered DHA inhibited
migration and invasion of NSCLC cells even in low
concentration with little cytotoxicity, and also inhibited
Warburg effect. Mechanically, DHA negatively regulates
NF-κB signaling to inhibit the GLUT1 translocation.
Blocking the NF-κB signaling primarily abolishes the
inhibitory influences of DHA on GLUT1 translocation to
the plasma membrane and metastasis. GLUT1 knockdown
significantly decreased migration and the inhibition of
invasion by DHA.

manner (Figure 1B). Subsequently, the effects of DHA
on the invasion of these cells were also determined by
matrigel invasion assay system. At 7.5 and 15 µM DHA,
the invasion capability cells were inhibited 20.7% and
26.5% in A549 cell, 25.1% and 31.7% in H1975 cells
respectively, compared to the control group (Figure 1C
and 1D). We found that 7.5 and 15 µM DHA decreased
ATP production, glucose uptake and lactate levels in
NSCLC cells (Figure 1E).

DHA inhibits the metastasis of NSCLC in vivo
To determine whether DHA treatment could reduce
metastasis in vivo, A549 cells were directly injected into
the tail vein of female nude mice. After injection, mice
received DHA treatment for 4 weeks. We found that the
formation of metastases in the lung was reduced by 45.3%
for the C1 group (50mg/kg/d), and 56.2% for the C2 group
(100mg/kg/d) (Figure 2A and 2B). Additional evidence of
the inhibition of metastasis in the DHA-treated group was
confirmed by the significant difference in whole-lung wet
weights among control and DHA treatment groups (Figure
2C). DHA treatment was well tolerated, as determined by
stable body weights throughout the 28 days’ treatment
period (data not shown). In general, these data suggest that
DHA inhibited metastasis of NSCLC cells in vivo.

DHA inhibits transcriptional activity of the
NF-κB gene
It has been proclaimed that inhibition of NFκB signaling pathway plays a critical role in regulating
gene expression [27, 28]. A549 and H1975 cells were
transfected with NF-κB luciferase plasmid, and then
incubated with DHA (15 µM) for 24 hours in order to
investigate the effect of DHA on the transcriptional
activity. The NF-κB luciferase reporter activity was
decreased by 30% after treated with DHA in NSCLC
cells (Supplementary Figure S2). Consistently, the
nuclear localization of p65 protein, the indicator of NFκB transcription activity, was also decreased in NSCLC
cells by DHA treatment (Figure 3A). These results were
conformed by immunostaining of p65 in A549 and H1975
cells (Figure 3B), indicating that DHA can inhibition
NF-κB nuclear translocation. In addition, the NF-κB
target genes, including cyclinD1, XIAP, BCL2 and c-myc
were down-regulated by DHA (Figure 3C). These results
together indicated that DHA inhibits the NF-κB signaling.

RESULTS
DHA depresses the Warburg effect, migration
and invasion in NSCLC cells
First of all, the dose of dependence of cytotoxic
effects of DHA in A549 and H1975 cells was determined
by using the MTT assay As shown in Figure 1A and
Supplementary Figure S1. Then the pharmacological
potential of DHA on antimetastasis activity was
investigated. It was found that DHA reduced cell viability
in a dose-dependent manner. DHA at concentration lower
than 15μM had no apparent cytotoxic act on the cells
and DHA at 30μM showed about a 15-20% decrease
in cell viability. We next used the wound-healing assay
and transwell assay to investigate the migratory abilities
of the two NSCLC cells treated with 7.5µM and 15 µM
DHA. Treatment with DHA for 24h reduced the migratory
abilities of these lung cancer cells in a dose-dependent

on the Warburg effect, migration and invasion depends
on the NF-κB signaling in lung cancer cells. As shown
in Supplementary Figure S3, DHA had no effect on the
Warburg effect, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells
knockdown of p65 by siRNA in these cells (P > 0.05).
Conversely, as shown in Figure 4A-4C, the impairment
of DHA on these events were rescued by in these NSCLC
cells overexpressing p65. These results suggested that
DHA negatively regulates the Warburg effect, migration
and invasion through its down-regulation of the NF-κB
signaling.

To understand the mechanism of the dysregulation
of Warburg effect by DHA, protein expression of glucose
transporters GLUT1 in NSCLC cells was tested. As shown
in Figure 5A, DHA did not inhibit the protein expression
of GLUT1 in A549 and H1975 cells. Furthermore, mycGLUT1 vectors that express GLUT1 with Myc tag in its
first exofacial loop transduced cells, and the level of it on
the cell surface were measured by immunofluorescence
(IF) staining with an anti-Myc antibody followed by

flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 5B, DHA
inhibited the level of Myc-GLUT1 on cell surface,
compared with the control group in both NSCLC cells.
These results indicate that GLUT1 plasma membrane
localization shown a tread of reduction in both cancer cells
treated with DHA. Plasma membrane protein was isolated
for the evaluation of GLUT1 trafficking to confirm the
dysregulation of GLUT1 plasma membrane trafficking in
NSCLC cells. DHA treatment reduced membrane bound
GLUT1 expression, a response consistent with our Flow
cytometric results (Figure 5C). These data suggest that
DHA inhibits translocation of GLUT1 to cytoplasmic
membrane in these NSCLC cells.

and H1975 cells (Figure 6A). Flow cytometric analysis of
cell surface GLUT1 expression showed ectopic expression
of p65 facilitated the translocation of Myc-GLUT1 to the
plasma membrane. In addition, p65 knockdown inhibited
the translocation of Myc-GLUT1 to the plasma membrane
in A549 and H1975 cells (Figure 6B). These data start a
raising a possibility that DHA inhibit GLUT1 translocation
through its negative regulation of the NF-κB signaling.
Consistent with this presume, our results clearly showed
that activating the NF-κB signaling by ectopic expression
of p65 mainly abolished the inhibitory effects of DHA on
GLUT1 translocation to cell surface in A549 and H1975
cells (Figure 6A). Therefore, these findings suggest that
DHA modulates the GLUT1 translocation to cell surface
through down-regulating NF-κB signaling.
Furthermore, A549 and H1975 cells were pretreated with 2 different GLUT1 siRNAs (GLUT1-siR)
before transfection with p65 expression vectors. The
invasion and migration were increased in p65-transfected
cells, whereas GLUT1 knockdown greatly attenuated the
promoting effects of p65 on in A549 and H1975 cells
(Figure 6C). Moreover, knockdown of the endogenous
GLUT1 by siRNA chiefly abolished the promoting effects
of NF-κB activation on migration, invasion, glucose
uptake, cell ATP content and lactate levels in A549 and
H1975 cells with overexpression of p65 (Figure 6B and
6C). These results together indicate that DHA suppresses
metastasis of non-small-cell lung cancer via inhibiting
NF-κB/GLUT1 axis.

Regulation of NF-κB to GLUT1 membrane
localization in NSCLC cells
Previous studies have reported that the activated
NF-κB signaling promotes the translocation of GLUT1
to the plasma membrane, which could be an important
mechanism by NF-κB activating the Warburg effect. To
determine whether Glut 1 translocation in response to DHA
in A549 and H1975 cells is dependent on the activation
of NF-κB signaling pathway, Glut1 translocation was
measured in transfected cells with p65 expression vectors
or p65-siR with Myc-GLUT1 vectors. Ectopic expression
of p65 greatly furthered the translocation of endogenous
GLUT1 to the plasma membrane as shown by westernblot using the isolated plsama membrane fraction of A549

DISCUSSION

drugs [43]. The pharmacokinetics of DHA has been
discussed in a few studies. DHA pharmacokinetics was
not discovered prominent sexual differences in previous
research that healthy volunteers taken oral DHA or
AS in Vietnam [44]. The t1/2 of IP-administered DHA
is approximately 40–70 min, whereas t1/2 of oraladministered DHA is predicted to be in the range of
0.8-1.5 hours. Oral DHA could be rapidly absorbed
in the gastrointestinal tract; Cmax was acquired at
approximately 1-2 hours of dosing. The pharmacokinetic
profile can be seen as a one-compartment open model
including first- order input and output, describing the
rapid absorption, distribution and elimination phase [45].
In fact, Artesunate, another anti-malarial drug, has shown
promise in crossover usage as an anti-cancer agent for a
variety of solid tumors [46, 47]. A case study demonstrated
a decrease of disease progression in a pituitary
macroadenoma patient who treated with artemether for
12 months [48]. In another research of a randomized
controlled trial investigated in 120 advanced non-small
cell lung cancer patients, control group with 60 patients
was treated with standard chemotherapy (vinorelbine
and cisplatin) and another group with 60 patients was
treated with 120 mg artesunate together with standard
chemotherapy intravenously. The negligible side effects
and improvement of short-term and one-year survival
rates were detected in the group with the artesunate-treated

Poor prognosis generally is discovered in NSCLC
patients with metastatic or relapsed NSCLC. Thus, new
improvement of therapies is needed for better treatment
outcomes of NSCLC patients. As an alternative means,
some pharmaceutical companies have adopted a drug
repurposing to accelerate the drug discovery and
development process. Drug repurposing, which is to
identify novel and useful indications for existing drugs
by targeting alternative diseases, has been proven to
effectively locate unmet medical needs for cancer [3235]. Drug repositioning in the United States is better
established and this means to produce six drugs approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in
2009. New indications have been introduced by drug
repositioning include aspirin, an NSAID, for colorectal
cancer [36]; thalidomide, a sedative hypnotic agent, for
multiple myeloma and leprosy [37]; a COX-2 inhibitor
for pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer [38, 39]
and metformin, an antidiabetic drug, for endometrial
cancer [40].
DHA possess anti-malarial activity and anti-cancer
activities. As a new class of anticancer drugs, DHA have
many advantages including low toxicity to normal tissue/
cells [41], low cross-drug resistance [42], and synergistic
effects with many traditional chemotherapeutic anticancer

patients, compared with control group [49]. DHA has
recently been reported to reduce the incidence and risk of
metastasis in breast cancer and osteosarcoma patients [50,
51]. However, the therapeutic efficacy and mode of action
of DHA in NSCLC are not well understood. In this study,
we demonstrated the efficiency of DHA on Warburg effect
and metastasis of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. In addition,
our results showed that DHA diminished Warburg effect
and metastasis of NSCLC cells probably via suppressing
NF-κB/GLUT1 axis. The results may open a new avenue
for the invention of novel agent in NSCLC therapy.
It has been reported that DHA suppressed cell
migration and invasion in various types of tumor cells.
Consistently, our results revealed that treatment of A549
and H1975 cells with low concentration of DHA had

minimal impact on growth but strongly reduced migration
and potential invasion, suggesting a role of DHA on cell
motility and invasion without affecting proliferation. More
important, our results provided evidences to indicate that
DHA could reverse the Warburg effect in NSCLC cells.
Moreover, therapy of targeting the pathway of glycolytic
may be a new implication via killing the malignant cells
because of association between increased metabolic
activity and glucose concentration and aggressiveness of
cancer. In this research, DHA inhibits the glucose uptake,
the rate of glycolysis, and lactate production of NSCLC
cells. These results might contribute to the consideration
that DHA could restrain the metastasis and invasion of
NSCLC cells as more aggressive tumors are seemly to
have a greater need for glucose, frequently show this

metabolic alteration. The increased glycolysis results in
chronic acidification of the local environment through
the conversion from pyruvate to lactic acid. This micro
environmental acidosis leads to cancer cells invasion and
metastasis.
The NF-κB signaling pathway is frequently
activated in various types of human cancers, and thus
agents capable of suppressing NF-κB activation may
provide therapeutic prospect [5, 52-54]. Our results

showed that NF-κB luciferase activity and NF-κB protein
expression were inhibited by DHA, as well as NF-κB
target genes, while ectopic expression of p65 largely
abolished the inhibitory effect of DHA on NSCLC cell
motility. These results are compliance with previous
reports that DHA inhibited activation of NF-κB in other
cancer cell lines and that resveratrol genistein, curcumin
and aspirin, all present within DHA, were associated with
NF-κB inactivation [55-59].

Figure 6: DHA inhibits GLUT1 translocation to the plasma membrane through down-regulating NF-κB signaling. A.

translocation of Myc-GLUT1 to the plasma membrane, and largely abolished the inhibitory effects of DHA on Myc-GLUT1 translocation

membrane (right panel) in A549 and H1975 cells. Cells were transfected with p65 expression vectors or p65-siR together with Myc-GLUT1

Studies reported that the NF-κB activation facilitates
the Warburg effect in cancer cells. Our data also confirmed
that the activation of NF-κB furthered the translocation
of GLUT1 to the plasma membrane in NSCLC cells.
DHA inhibited the GLUT1 translocation mainly through
the down-regulation of NF-κB activities. Activating the
NF-κB signaling mostly abolished the inhibitory effects
of DHA on GLUT1 translocation and the Warburg effect.
Furthermore, GLUT1 knockdown greatly attenuated the
improving effects of p65 on glucose uptake, ATP content
and lactate levels in A549 and H1975 cells. (Figure 6C).
Meanwhile, GLUT1 knockdown significantly decreased
the inhibition of invasion, and migration of lung cancer
cells. These data indicated that DHA influenced the
invasion and migration of lung cancer cells by regulating
the expression of NF-κB, which changed the GLUT1
translocation.
Warburg effect has been addressed to use positron
emission tomography (PET) with the glucose analog
tracer in clinical oncology. The involvement of a series
of onco-proteins and tumor suppressors, including p53,
hypoxia-inducible factor, Myc and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling pathway in the regulation of this metabolic
adaptation that favors cellular proliferation, tumor growth
and angiogenesis has been reported. Our previous studies
have shown that DHA-suppressed glycolytic metabolism
has connection with inhibition of mTOR activation
[16]. Furthermore, the reduction of glucose uptake and
ATP content was inhibited by overexpression of Rheb
suppressed in DHA-treated A549 cells. In this study, we
likewise found DHA inhibition on NF-κB signaling could
be reverted by overexpression of Rheb in lung cancer
cells (Supplementary Figure S4). It has been presented
that inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin could prevent
glucose uptake [60]. Additionally, a previous report has
reported that mTOR/NF-κB pathway regulates aerobic
glycolysis in vascular smooth muscle cells [61]. Therefore,
this provided a possibility, GLUT1 expression may be
decreased by DHA via mTOR/NF-κB pathway thereby
inhibited glucose uptake.
In summary, the results from this study demonstrated
that DHA could be a useful agent for inhibiting tumor
metastasis in NSCLC. Also, GLUT1 modulation via NFκB inactivation could be a critical cancer targeted strategy.
On the basis of our findings, further in-depth researches
including clinical trials are required to fully understand the
value of DHA as an anticancer agent in NSCLC.

(Gibco, Life Technologies), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100
μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown in a humidified
incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells were grown in
monolayer and passaged routinely 2–3 times a week.
Antibodies against GLUT1 were purchased from
Abcam (Cambridge, UK); The specific primary antibodies
for p65, actin, Pan-Cadherin, cyclin D1, c-myc, XIAP, and
lamin B1 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for BCL-2 was
purchased from Assay Biotechnology (Sunnyvale, CA,
USA). An antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibodies were purchased from
Kangchen Co. (Shanghai China). DHA was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. For drug treatment, DHA were
dissolved in DMSO; aliquots were stored at -80°C. Stock
solutions were diluted to the desired final concentrations
with growth medium just before use. Cells were seeded in
triplicate at a density of 0.1–0.2 million/well in six well
plates. Prior to drug treatment, cells were incubated for at
least 12 h and thereafter replaced with media containing
drugs, followed by 24 or 48 h incubation. DMSO-treated
cells were used as a mock control.

Cell viability
The MTT assay was performed as previously
described to determine the sensitivity of cells to drugs
[62]. Briefly, cells (3 × 103 per well) were plated in 96well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and
incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2. After 24 h of incubation,
DHA at various concentrations was added into the wells,
followed by additional incubation for 68 h. MTT was then
added to the wells and cells were incubated for additional
4 h. Finally, the optical density at 490 nm was measured
using a multi-well plate reader (Micro-plate Reader,
Bio-Rad). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was
determined as the anticancer drug concentration causing
50% reduction of cell viability and calculated from the
cytotoxicity curves (Bliss method) [32]. Cell survival was
calculated using the following formula: survival (%) =
(mean experimental absorbance/mean control absorbance)
× 100%.

Measurements of glucose levels and lactate
production of cells in the media
Per well of a 12-well plate was seeded with a total of
3×105cells treated with various drugs. For assessment of
glucose uptake, the media were collected and the glucose
was immediately measured using an Olympus AU5400
(Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). For assessment of
lactate production, the media was collected and diluted
1:100 in lactate assay buffer. The amount of lactate
present in the media was then estimated using the Lactate
Assay Kit (sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

(Thermo Scientific). The Firefly luciferase activity was
normalized to that of Renilla.

Transfection experiment
A549 or H1975 cells were reverse transfected with
either NF-κB overexpressing plasmid or vector using
FuGene 6 (Roche Diagnostics) transfection reagent
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 2
μg plasmid DNA was diluted in Opti-MEM media and
FuGene 6 transfection reagent was added in a ratio of 1:3
(w: v). The mixture was incubated at room temperature
for 1 h in a six-well plate. Transfected cells were treated
with DHA or 0.1% dimethylsulphoxide or for 24 h and
then subjected to migration and invasion assay or western
blot detection.

Animal experiment
Female BALB/c athymic nude mice, 5- to 6-weekold, were pursued from the Experimental Animal Center
of Xiamen University (China). All animals were fed with
a standard diet ad libitum and housed in a temperaturecontrolled animal facility with a 12/12 hours’ light/dark
cycle. All procedures were performed according to the
NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and
were approved by the Bioethics Committee of Xiamen
University. For experimental metastasis model, A549
cells (1×106 cells) in 300μL PBS were injected directly
into the tail veins of mice (28). One week after cell
injection, the mice were randomized into a control group
C0 (0 g/kg/d), or intervention groups C1 (50 mg/kg/d),
or C2 (100 mg/kg/d) with stepwise increases in DHA
doses. Each experimental group contained 5 mice. Mice
were sacrificed after daily treatment for 28 days, and their
lungs were weighed and subjected to tissue sectioning. To
examine the metastases, 100 sequential sections (5 μm)
were cut from the lungs of each mouse, and every 10th
section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

In vitro wound-healing assay
Cells were seeded in six-well plates and allowed to
grow overnight to confluence. The monolayer cells were
scratched with a 200 μl pipette tip to create a wound and
washed twice with serum-free DMEM to remove floating
cells and the cells were then incubated in serum-free
DMEM. The rate of wound closure was investigated by
photography 24 h later. Each value was derived from three
randomly selected fields.

Boyden chamber assay
The migration and invasion assay was examined
using 24-well Boyden chambers with 8 μm inserts
coated without (migration) or with Matrigel (invasion) as
previously described. 5 ×104 cells were plated in the upper
chambers without serum and supplemented with DHA and
cultured at 37°C for 24 h. The cells that crossed the inserts
were stained with crystal violet (Sigma) and then observed
under phase-contrast microscopy and counted.

Analysis of the levels of Myc-GLUT1 on the
plasma membrane
Cells were transduced with pcDNA3.2-MycGLUT1 vectors which express the GLUT1 with Myc tag
in the first exofacial loop. At 48 h after transduction, the
levels of Myc-GLUT1 on the cell surface and in whole
cells were measured by IF staining in a flow cytometer as
described [63]. The relative levels of Myc-GLUT1 on the
cell surface were calculated after normalization with the
total levels of Myc-GLUT1 in cells.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed on ice with RIPA buffer. The
protein concentration was determined by Bradford dye
method. Equal amounts (20 to 40 μg) of cell extract
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF
membranes (Millipore) for antibody blotting. The
membranes were blocked and incubated with primary
