Inhibition of AMPK and Krebs Cycle Gene Expression Drives
Metabolic Remodeling of Pten-Deﬁcient Preneoplastic
Thyroid Cells

Abstract
Rapidly proliferating and neoplastically transformed cells generate the energy required to support rapid cell
division by increasing glycolysis and decreasing ﬂux through the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway,
usually without alterations in mitochondrial function. In contrast, little is known of the metabolic alterations, if
any, which occur in cells harboring mutations that prime their neoplastic transformation. To address this
question, we used a Pten-deﬁcient mouse model to examine thyroid cells where a mild hyperplasia progresses
slowly to follicular thyroid carcinoma. Using this model, we report that constitutive phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) activation caused by PTEN deﬁciency in nontransformed thyrocytes results in a global downregulation of
Krebs cycle and OXPHOS gene expression, defective mitochondria, reduced respiration, and an enhancement in
compensatory glycolysis. We found that this process does not involve any of the pathways classically associated
with the Warburg effect. Moreover, this process was independent of proliferation but contributed directly to
thyroid hyperplasia. Our ﬁndings deﬁne a novel metabolic switch to glycolysis driven by PI3K-dependent AMPK
inactivation with a consequent repression in the expression of key metabolic transcription regulators. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Highly proliferative conditions, such as embryonic development, tissue regeneration, lymphocyte activation, and neoplastic transformation, require a complex reorganization of energy
metabolism to feed cell growth and division (1). A major
feature of this metabolic remodeling is the switch from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis, a
phenomenon that was ﬁrst observed by Warburg (2). As a
consequence, highly proliferating cells exhibit an increase in
the amount of lactate production regardless of oxygen availability (3).
It is widely accepted that several oncogenes, including
MYC, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a, and AKT (4–6),
drive this switch by increasing the expression and activity
of glycolytic genes, including hexokinase II, lactate dehydrogenase A, pyruvate kinase M2, and pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinase 1 (7–9).

The reduced ﬂux through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle and OXPHOS is not accompanied by compromised
mitochondrial function, and is not associated with alterations in the expression levels of genes involved in oxidative
metabolism. One exception to this notion is represented
by those tumors in which FH, SDH, or IDH are mutated
(10).
To characterize the molecular changes resulting from
constitutive activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) pathway in tissues where this genetic alteration is
causally linked to neoplastic transformation, we have generated a mouse model in which loss of the Pten tumor
suppressor gene is targeted to the follicular epithelium of
the thyroid gland (11). Thyrocyte-speciﬁc deletion of Pten
constitutively activates the PI3K signaling cascade, leading
to hyperplastic thyroid glands at birth, to the development of
thyroid follicular adenomas by 6 to 8 months of age (11), and
of metastatic follicular carcinomas after 1 year of age (12).
The progression to neoplastic transformation is dramatically accelerated by simultaneous Cdkn1b deletion (12), activation of Kras (13), or Tp53 deletion (14).
By analyzing the molecular and metabolic alterations
found in thyroids from young, tumor-free Ptenthyr/ mice,
we have discovered a novel mechanism responsible for the
active repression of TCA cycle and OXPHOS in preneoplastic
thyrocytes. This pathway is independent of both proliferation and of the known pathways classically associated with
the Warburg effect. We show in fact that PI3K activation
induces, through the inactivation of AMPK, a coordinated
repression of the expression of TCA cycle and respiratory

OXPHOS.

Materials and Methods
Animals
The PtenL/L and TPO-Cre strains have been previously
described (11). PDKL/L mice were kindly provided by Dr. Dario
Alessi (University of Dundee) (15). All strains were backcrossed
in the 129Sv background for at least 10 generations, and
littermates were used as controls. RAD001 (Everolimus; kindly
provided by Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Basel,
Switzerland) was given daily by oral gavage at a dose of
10 mg/kg body weight for 2 weeks, starting at age 4 weeks.
5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-b-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR;
TRC) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 400 mg/kg/d, for
4 weeks, starting at age 4 weeks.
Measurement of glucose uptake by PET
Wild-type (WT) and Ptenthyr/ mice were fasted overnight
before a tail vein injection of 2[18F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose
(FDG; 300 mCi). One hour after injection, mice were subjected
to positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with the
Concorde Microsystems R4 microPET Scanner. Animals were
imaged while anesthetized by inhalation with isoﬂurane.
Image acquisition was done using the MicroPET Manager
with the ASPIRO-dedicated software.
Primary cultures
Thyroid glands were minced and resuspended in Ham's F12/
10% FBS with 100 U/mL type I collagenase (Sigma) and 1 U/mL
dispase (Roche). Enzymatic digestion was carried out for 90
minutes at 37 C. After digestion, follicles were seeded in Ham's
F12 containing 40% Nu-Serum IV (Collaborative Biomedical),
gly-his-lys (10 ng/mL; Sigma), and somatostatin (10 ng/mL;
Sigma) and allowed to spread for 24 to 36 hours before carrying
out the experiments.
Proliferation analysis
Anti-Ki67–stained thyroid sections were photographed at
400 magniﬁcation and analyzed using the ImageJ software.
Between 1,500 and 3,000 cells per slide were analyzed. For
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation experiments,
mice were injected i.p. with BrdUrd (10 mg/kg; Sigma) and
dissolved in PBS 2 hours before sacriﬁce. Anti-BrdUrd–stained
sections were analyzed as above.
Lactate assay
Lactate levels were assayed using a commercially available
kit (Biovision). Lactate levels were normalized to the amount of
DNA or proteins extracted from each tissue fragment or
primary culture.
Oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidiﬁcation
rate
Freshly isolated thyroid follicles from pools of 12 WT or 3
mutant mice were plated as described in "Primary cultures,"
and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured using
the Seahorse XF24 instrument (Seahorse Biosciences) under

inhibitor oligomycin (1 mg/mL), the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 4-(triﬂuoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone
(FCCP; 1 mmol/L), and the respiratory chain inhibitors
antimycin A (2 mmol/L) and rotenone (0.1 mmol/L).
Flow cytometry analysis of mitochondrial membrane
potential
Primary thyroid cells were treated with solvent or 20 mmol/L
FCCP for 10 minutes before staining with 100 nmol/L tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE; Invitrogen) for 20 minutes. Cells were rinsed in Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS), trypsinized,
and analyzed for TMRE staining by ﬂow cytometry.
Western blot analysis
Thyroids and cells were homogenized on ice in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor Tablet (Roche Diagnostics). Western
blot analysis was conducted using 20 to 40 mg proteins using
antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology, except for aconitase 2, isocitrate dehydrogenase 3a, HIF-1a, and succinate
dehydrogenase b (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and b-actin
(Sigma-Aldrich).
Cell lines and drug treatments
FTC-133 cells (kindly donated by Dr. Matthew Ringel, Ohio
State University, Columbus, OH) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS at 37 C
in 5% CO2. 8505c cells (kindly donated by Dr. Sareh Parangi,
Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) and THJ16T
cells (kindly donated by Dr. John A. Copland, Mayo Clinic,
Jacksonville, FL) were grown in RPMI medium with 10% FBS.
All cell lines were validated before starting the experiments
by amplifying and sequencing genomic fragments encompassing their known mutations (FTC133: PTEN R130 ,8505c: BRAF
V600E, THJ16T: PIK3CA E545K).
Pharmacologic inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA; H89; Cell
Signaling Technology), and PI3K (BKM120; Selleck Chemicals),
or AMP analog (AICAR; TRC) were added 24 hours after
plating. After 30 minutes, samples were collected and prepared
for Western blot analysis. For luciferase and quantitative PCR
(qPCR) experiments, samples were collected after 72 hours.
Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol and reverse transcribed using the ThermoScript Kit (Life Technologies). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted on a StepOne
Plus apparatus using the Absolute Blue qPCR Rox Mix (Thermo
Scientiﬁc) and TaqMan expression assays (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was run in triplicate and GusB or b-actin
was used to control the input RNA. Data analysis was based on
the Ct method and experiments were repeated at least three
times using at least two independent thyroid pools (at least ﬁve
mice/pool).
AMP, ADP, ATP level determination
AMP, ADP, and ATP levels were assayed using three independent thyroid pools (10 mice/pool). Approximately, 30 mg of

tissue was extracted in 210 mL of extraction solvent, 40%/
40%/20% acetonitrile/methanol/0.1% formamide in water containing a 15N_AMP extraction standard. The column [Sequent
ZIC-cHILIC (3.5 mm, 100 mm  2.1 mm, inner diameter)] was
run with a gradient of 90% acetonitrile/10% water containing
10 mmol/L ammonium formate, pH 3.0, at 0.2 mL/min using
an ACQUITY ultra performance liquid chromatography attached to a Waters Xevo triple quadruple mass spectrometry.
Transient transfection assays
Cells were transfected with 1 mg PGC-1a WT or T177A/
S538A plasmid (#1026, #18093; Addgene). After 24 hours, cells
were treated with 1 mmol/L AICAR (TRC) for 48 hours and
collected for RNA isolation.
Dual luciferase assay
Cells were cotransfected with 10 ng phRG-TK plasmid
(Promega) and 2 mg PGC-1a promoter luciferase plasmid
(#8887; Addgene). After 24 hours, cells were treated with
inhibitors for 48 hours and collected for dual-luciferase reporter assay (Promega).
Transmission electron microscopy
Thyroid glands were ﬁxed with 2% paraformaldehyde and
2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L sodium cacodylate buffer,
postﬁxed with 1% osmium tetroxide followed by 1% uranyl
acetate, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol and
embedded in LX112 resin (LADD Research Industries). Ultrathin (80 nm) sections were cut on a Reichert Ultracut UCT,
stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate, and viewed
on a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope at 80 kV.
Proteomic analysis
Sets of thyroid extracts (100 mg) from 3-month-old WT and
mutant mice were subjected to two-dimensional (2D) gel
electrophoresis (pH 4-11) and Sypro Ruby gel staining as
described in ref. 16. About 30 differentially expressed spots
were selected for cutting and in-gel tryptic digestion. Matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization–time-of-ﬂight (MALDITOF) peptide mass ﬁngerprinting was conducted as described
in ref. 16. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry
(LC/MS-MS) peptide sequencing was conducted as described

in ref. 17. All analyses were conducted by the Fox Chase Cancer
Center Proteomics Facility, Philadelphia, PA.
Statistical analysis
Experiments were carried out at least three times. Data were
analyzed using the Prism software package. Differences with P
values less than 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Constitutive PI3K activity results in transcriptional
repression of TCA cycle and OXPHOS genes
The thyroids of Ptenthyr/ mice are enlarged from birth due
to an increase in the thyrocytes' proliferative index associated
with constitutive PI3K signaling. However, these glands do not
display any functional alteration or signs of neoplastic transformation until the mice are at least 10 months of age (12).
To identify early molecular changes that may favor or
contribute to the development of thyroid tumors in aging
mice, we have initially used a small-scale proteomic approach
to detect proteins differentially expressed in thyroids from 3month-old WT and Ptenthyr/ mice. Several spots, with signiﬁcantly different intensity between normal and mutant
thyroids, were selected and excised from 2D gels, and 35
proteins were identiﬁed using MALDI-TOF and LC/MS-MS.
Surprisingly, 7 of 28 proteins found downregulated in mutant
thyroids were enzymes involved in the TCA cycle (Table 1). To
validate these ﬁndings, we measured by RT-PCR the mRNA
levels of the genes encoding these proteins and found that Cs,
Aco2, Idh3a, Dld, Pdhb, and SdhA expression in mutant thyroids
was reproducibly 20% to 50% lower compared with that of WT
glands, whereas the expression of the glucose transporter Glut1
was slightly increased (Fig. 1A). Downregulation of these genes
was also conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis using antibodies
speciﬁc for aconitase 2, isocitrate dehydrogenase 3a, and
succinate dehydrogenase b (Fig. 1B).
To determine to what extent metabolic genes are transcriptionally deregulated upon PI3K activation, we interrogated our
Affymetrix gene expression dataset (14) to extend the analysis
to all the genes directly involved in the TCA cycle and glycolysis. Interestingly, while none of the glycolytic enzymes was
transcriptionally deregulated in the mutant glands (with the
exception of a modest increase in the Glucokinase mRNA

levels), the expression of 22 of 28 genes encoding enzymes
associated with the TCA cycle was signiﬁcantly repressed in
Pten/ thyroids (Fig. 1C; data not shown). About 60% of these
genes were still repressed in the metastatic follicular carcinomas developing in older Ptenthyr/ mice (Fig. 1D).
Furthermore, when we quantitated citrate and isocitrate in
the thyroids of control and Ptenthyr/ mice by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), we found signiﬁcantly
reduced levels of these metabolites in the mutant glands
(citrate, 2,577  525 pmol/mg in the WT and 985  302 in
the mutants; isocitrate, 217  42 pmol/mg in the WT and 80 
26 in the mutants).
The tight connection existing between TCA cycle, OXPHOS,
and mitochondrial ﬁtness prompted us to test whether this
global downregulation of TCA cycle genes is accompanied by
alterations of the expression of mitochondrial-encoded
OXPHOS genes, as well as by changes in the number of
mitochondria. We ﬁrst used RT-PCR to measure the relative
mitochondrial genome copy number by amplifying four different mitochondrially encoded genes and one reference nuclear gene from total (genomic and mitochondrial) DNA isolated
from WT and mutant thyroids. No signiﬁcant differences were
found between control and mutants, suggesting that constitutive PI3K activation does not alter mitochondrial mass in the
mouse thyroid (Fig. 1E). Conversely, the expression of most
mitochondrial-encoded genes was heavily downregulated in
Pten/ thyroids (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, electron microscopy
analysis of control and mutant thyroid sections showed that
Pten loss caused profound morphologic defects in the mitochondria, including swelling, matrix clariﬁcation, and disruption of the cristae (Fig. 1F). All these features are commonly
associated with reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity (18).
To test whether the aforementioned ﬁndings reﬂect
an impairment in mitochondrial function, we measured OCR
as well as extracellular acidiﬁcation rate (ECAR) in primary
cultures of control and Pten/ thyrocytes. Strikingly, Pten/
thyrocytes exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced spare respiratory
capacity, that is, lower maximal rate of respiration (Fig. 1G) and
increased ECAR (Fig. 1H). Finally, we used ﬂow cytometry to
compare the mitochondrial membrane potential in primary
cultures of control and Pten/ thyrocytes using the cationic
potential-sensitive dye, TMRE, which accumulates in intact
mitochondria. The main population of mutant cells displayed
reduced mitochondrial membrane potential compared with
control thyrocytes (about 50% of WT levels, note the logarithmic scale; Fig. 1I), whereas a second population of mutant cells
was characterized by even lower potential, similar to that of
cells treated with the uncoupler FCCP.
Taken together, these data show that constitutive PI3K
activation in the mouse thyroid results in the coordinated
downregulation of the expression of genes encoding members
of both the TCA cycle and OXPHOS pathways, in extensive
mitochondrial damage, and in severe impairment of mitochondrial function.
A glycolytic switch in preneoplastic Pten/ thyrocytes
Because the expression changes described earlier result in
reduced efﬁciency of the TCA cycle/OXPHOS metabolic path-

www.aacrjournals.org

way, the mutant cells might have to increase their glycolytic
rate to meet their energetic needs.
As a proxy for the thyrocytes' glycolytic rate, we assessed the
amount of lactate present in thyroids from 3-month-old WT
and mutant mice. Strikingly, Pten/ thyroids displayed a 3fold increase in normalized lactate content, suggesting a higher
metabolic ﬂux through glycolysis (Fig. 2A). Along the same line,
we measured the lactate secretion rate in primary thyrocyte
cultures. Mutant cells produced 3- to 5-fold more lactate than
their WT counterparts (Fig. 2B), strongly indicating that glycolysis is indeed upregulated to compensate the PI3K-mediated repression of the TCA cycle/OXPHOS pathway. Finally, to
validate this hypothesis, we conducted FDG-PET imaging on
control and Ptenthyr/ mice and found that the hyperplastic
Pten/ thyroids showed strong FDG uptake, whereas no
uptake was detected in WT mice (Fig. 2C).
These data show that, in response to constitutive PI3K
activation, thyroid epithelial cells undergo a glycolytic switch,
which is functionally reminiscent of the Warburg effect
observed in cancer cells, as well as in highly proliferating cells
such as activated lymphocytes.
The Warburg effect is usually driven by a set of "master
genes," including c-MYC, AKT, mTOR, and HIF-1a, which control the expression, localization, and function of both glucose
transporters and glycolytic enzymes (5, 19). Upregulation of
hexokinase 2, pyruvate kinase M2, and lactate dehydrogenases
A and B are hallmarks of this glycolytic switch.
The establishment of a glycolytic switch in slowly proliferating, non-neoplastic (i.e., nontransformed) cells, and the
absence of glycolytic genes upregulation in our expression
proﬁling data would argue against a mechanism involving the
classical Warburg effect–related master regulators. In fact, we
did not detect signiﬁcant alterations in the expression levels of
Hif-1a, c-Myc, Hk2, Pkm2, Ldha, or Ldhb both at the RNA and
protein level (Fig. 2D and E; data not shown).
These data suggest that PI3K activation in nontransformed
thyroid epithelial cells induces a glycolytic switch through a
novel molecular mechanism.
Pdk1 drives TCA cycle/OXPHOS gene repression
downstream of PI3K, independent of mTOR
Pdk1 is an essential member of the PI3K cascade, as it
phosphorylates Akt on T308 and S6k1 on T229, allowing their
full activation (20). To test to what extent the TCA cycle gene
repression observed in Pten/ thyroids depends on the Pdk1/
Akt/mTOR cascade, we ﬁrst crossed Ptenthyr/ mice to Pdk1
conditional mutants (21), obtaining simultaneous thyroidspeciﬁc deletion of these two genes. Combined loss of Pten
and Pdk1 rescued both the repression of the TCA cycle genes
(Fig. 3A) and that of mitochondrially encoded OXPHOS genes
(Fig. 3B). Interestingly, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded
gene expression in the compound mutants was higher than in
WT controls. Furthermore, simultaneous inactivation of Pten
and Pdk1 restored lactate production in the thyroid to WT
levels (Fig. 3C).
Constitutive PI3K activation in the thyroid follicular cells
results in mTOR activation (22), and mTOR activity has been
proposed to play a key role in establishing the glycolytic switch

(23). To test the role of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis in the
metabolic phenotype of Ptenthyr/ mice, we treated 3month-old WT and mutant mice (n ¼ 5/group) daily for 2
weeks with the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 or placebo (Fig. 3D).
As previously shown by our group, this treatment is sufﬁcient
to inhibit mTOR activity and drastically reduce proliferation
in mutant thyroids (Fig. 3D and E; ref. 22). Strikingly, despite
the clear inhibition of the thyrocytes' proliferation rate,
RAD001 treatment had no effect on the repression of TCA
cycle genes (Fig. 3F), on the repression of mitochondrial genes
(Fig. 3G), or on thyroid lactate production (Fig. 3H).
These data strongly suggest that PI3K activation in thyroid cells induces a glycolytic switch independent of mTOR
activity. Furthermore, they show that the increase in glycolysis in Ptenthyr/ mice is not a direct consequence of the
increased proliferative rate observed in the hyperplastic
glands.

encoded transcription factors and coactivators that modulate
mitochondrial function in response to extra- and intracellular
signals.
To identify the mechanism through which loss of Pten
results in a coordinated reprogramming of the expression of
respiratory genes, we initially measured in thyroids from 3month-old WT and Ptenthyr/ mice the expression levels of
the transcription factors and cofactors involved in the regulation of TCA cycle/OXPHOS. Although the expression levels of
ERRb, PRC, NRF-1 and -2, and TFAM were not altered by
constitutive PI3K activation, Ptenthyr/ thyroids had signiﬁcantly lower expression of ERRg, PGC-1a and -b, and, to a lesser
extent, ERRa (Fig. 4A). These data suggest that PI3K activation
might alter the expression or activity of a common master
regulatory gene.
Recently published data have directed our attention on
AMPK as a candidate for this role. AMPK contributes to the
control of respiratory genes in muscle cells (24) and phosphorylates PGC-1a on T177 and S538 to increase its transcriptional
activity, including its ability to transactivate its own promoter
(25). In addition, the ESRRA promoter contains a PGC-1a/
ERRa-responsive regulatory element that can also be

recognized and activated by ERRb and ERRg (26). Furthermore, in certain cell types, AKT can phosphorylate AMPK on
S485, preventing LKB1 from phosphorylating (on T172) and
activating AMPK (27, 28). Indeed, we found that thyroids
from Ptenthyr/ mice have drastically reduced pT172- and
higher pS485-AMPK, compared with WT controls, and
reduced levels of phosphorylated ACC (Fig. 4B). Because it
is theoretically possible that the reduced levels of pT172AMPK in the mutant glands might be due to a low AMP/ATP
ratio, we measured AMP, ADP, and ATP levels in extracts
from WT and mutant glands. AMP and ATP levels in mutant
glands were comparable with WT controls, whereas ADP
levels were slightly higher on the mutant glands. These data
indicate that PI3K inhibits AMPK despite AMP/ATP and
ADP/ATP ratios that would stimulate AMPK activation, as in
WT glands (Fig. 4C).

To test the hypothesis that PI3K activation represses TCA
cycle/OXPHOS gene expression through the inhibition of
AMPK, we treated WT and Ptenthyr/ mice with the AMPK
activator AICAR for 4 weeks, and then isolated their thyroid
glands. AICAR treatment increased pT172-AMPK levels not
only in WT mice, but also (and to the same levels) in Ptenthyr/
mice, despite the persistent AKT activation and inhibitory
AMPK phosphorylation on S485 (Fig. 5A). Furthermore,
AICAR-activated AMPK restored ACC phosphorylation on
Ser79 (Fig. 5D).
We next measured the expression of ERRa, ERRg, PGC-1a,
and PGC-1b in the thyroids of control, mutant, and AICARtreated mutant mice. Strikingly, AICAR treatment increased
the mRNA levels of all four transcription factors and cofactors to near-WT levels (Fig. 5B). To verify that the increase
in transcriptional regulator levels translates in a restoration

of normal TCA cycle/OXPHOS gene expression, we measured by qPCR and Western blotting the expression levels of
selected TCA cycle genes, and found that AICAR treatment
had completely rescued the PI3K-dependent repression of
Aco2, Idh3a, and Pdhb (Fig. 5C and D). However, when
we tested the expression of the mitochondrial-encoded
OXPHOS genes, we could only detect a partial rescue upon
AICAR treatment (Fig. 5E). Furthermore, the extent of
mitochondrial damage observed in Ptenthyr/ thyrocytes
was only mildly reduced by AICAR treatment (Fig. 5F).
Despite the persistence of some mitochondrial damage,
enforced AMPK activation reversed the glycolytic switch
induced by constitutive PI3K activation, as shown by the
reduction of lactate content to WT levels in AICAR-treated
Ptenthyr/ mice (Fig. 5G).
These data strongly suggest that PI3K/AKT–mediated
AMPK inhibition is responsible for the repression of oxidative
metabolism gene expression observed in Ptenthyr/ mice.

morigenic phenotype of mutant thyrocytes, we compared the
weight and proliferative index of WT, Ptenthyr/, and AICARtreated mutant thyroid glands. During the 4 weeks of enforced
AMPK reactivation, mutant glands grew at a much slower
rate compared with untreated mutants, so that the weight of
the mutant thyroids at the end of the treatment was signiﬁcantly reduced compared with untreated Ptenthyr/ mice
(34%; Fig. 5H). This size reduction was associated with
decreased proliferation: the thyrocyte proliferation index in
AICAR-treated mice, determined by BrdUrd incorporation,
was drastically reduced, compared with that of untreated
mutant mice (53%; Fig. 5I). Thus, it is possible that that the
glycolytic switch caused by PI3K-mediated AMPK inhibition
actively contributes to the development of thyroid hyperplasia
in Ptenthyr/ mice.

A Novel Metabolism-Remodeling Pathway

1a T177 and S538 (25). To test whether this pathway, discovered in skeletal muscle cells, is also active in thyrocytes, we
transfected FTC-133 cells with an expression vector encoding
WT or phosphorylation-defective PGC-1a (PGC-1a-AA), treated the cells with vehicle or AICAR to reverse the inhibition of
AMPK, and extracted mRNA to measure the expression of a
group of TCA cycle genes. AMPK reactivation increased the
expression of ACO2, IDH3A, and PDHB in cells transfected with
WT PGC-1a but not, or to a much lower extent, in those cells
transfected with the PGC-1a- mutant that cannot be phosphorylated (Fig. 6C). Thus, PGC-1a acts as a conduit for AMPK
to control the expression of metabolic genes.
To test whether AMPK repression in human cells is directly
associated with PI3K activation, we treated FTC-133 cells
with the pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120. Surprisingly, PI3K inhibition at a BKM concentration that has no off-target effects
(1 mmol/L) was not sufﬁcient to abolish S485 phosphorylation,
or to induce T172 phosphorylation (Fig. 6D). However, higher
BKM120 concentrations could achieve these effects (data not
shown) suggesting that other related kinases might contribute
to S485 phosphorylation and AMPK inhibition.
PKA has been shown to phosphorylate S485-AMPK in the
insulin-secreting cell line, INS-1 (29). Furthermore, in mouse
adipocytes, PKA can phosphorylate AMPK on S173, inhibiting
T172 phosphorylation, likely through steric hindrance (30).
Thus, we tested whether PKA inhibition could synergize with
PI3K inhibition to restore AMPK activity and respiratory gene
expression. Strikingly, while FTC-133 treatment with the PKA
inhibitor H89 alone did not result in alterations of the phosphorylation status of AMPK, simultaneous inhibition of PI3K
and PKA abolished pS485-AMPK and drastically increased
pT172-AMPK (Fig. 6D). Accordingly, while single-inhibitor
treatment of FTC-133 failed to increase the expression of TCA
cycle genes, or PGC-1a and PGC-1b, combined treatment
signiﬁcantly increased their mRNA levels (Fig. 6E). Combined
inhibition of PI3K and PKA was also more effective than either
kinase inhibition in increasing the expression of a luciferase
reporter driven by the promoter region of PGC-1a, further
supporting the role of AMPK in the control of PGC-1a activity
and expression (Fig. 6F).
These data suggest that the PI3K/AKT axis controls AMPK
activity also in PTEN/ human thyroid cancer cells; however,
in these cells, PKA contributes to the metabolic reprogramming through an overlapping pathway.
To test whether this signaling cascade is also active in
human anaplastic thyroid cancer, we used two cell lines
representative of the most common driver pathways in this
aggressive and genetically complex tumor type: THJ16T, harboring an activating PIK3CA mutation (E545K), and 8505c,
harboring the BRAF oncogenic allele V600E.
Both cell lines displayed low to undetectable pT172-AMPK,
as well as strong pS485-AMPK, suggesting that AMPK inhibition is a common theme in thyroid cancer (Fig. 6G). AICAR
treatment restored T172 phosphorylation, more effectively in
the cell line harboring the PI3K oncogenic mutation (Fig. 6G).
When we treated these cells with PI3K and PKA inhibitors,
alone and in combination, we found that simultaneous
PI3K and PKA inhibition effectively reactivated AMPK and

www.aacrjournals.org

increased the expression of metabolic regulators such as ERRg
and PGC-1b in cells with constitutively active PI3K; however,
they did not affect AMPK activation or ERRg and PGC-1b
expression in the BRAFV600E cell line (Fig. 6H and I). Similar to
the in vivo model, AMPK reactivation reduced proliferation of a
panel of mouse and human thyroid cancer cell lines carrying
PI3K-activating mutations (Fig. 6J).
Thus, in well-differentiated and undifferentiated human
thyroid cancer cells, constitutive activation of PI3K, in cooperation with PKA, alters the expression of genes involved in
respiratory metabolism by inhibiting AMPK.
TCA cycle gene repression in neoplastic lesions is also
observed in other human tissues
To extend our ﬁndings to human tumors other than those
arising in the thyroid, we interrogated the Oncomine database
for datasets showing signiﬁcant simultaneous downregulation
of both PTEN and TCA cycle genes. Although this approach
does not account for other, more common, PI3K-activating
mechanisms, it represents the only direct way to identify,
within large expression datasets, tumors with activated
PI3K signaling, in the absence of validated "PI3K activation"
signatures.
Considering the inherent low power of our search, it is
remarkable that we found a very strong association between
PTEN loss and TCA cycle repression in two datasets, derived
from dedifferentiated liposarcoma and from early-stage colon
cancer (Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, other human tumor
types display global downregulation of TCA cycle genes in
association with PTEN loss and PI3K activation, warranting
future studies to experimentally validate this association.

Discussion
The existence of a tight link between PI3K signaling and
rerouting of energy metabolism is well established in cancer
cells, where activation of PI3K contributes to the switch
from oxidative to glycolytic pathways through several of its
downstream effectors, including AKT, mTOR, and HIF-1a
(31). In turn, these effectors increase the expression and/or
activity of a variety of glycolytic enzymes, such as hexokinase
II (32), phosphofructokinase 2 (33), the GLUT family of
glucose transporters (34), lactate dehydrogenases (35, 36),
and the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (23). Thus, in fully
transformed cells, the Warburg effect is achieved through an
increase in glycolytic ﬂux, whereas mitochondrial metabolism is unaffected.
Little is known of the mechanism(s) regulating energy
metabolism in normal and preneoplastic (i.e., carrying single
mutations and not yet transformed) cells. There is a consensus
that in normal cells the glycolytic switch is linked to high
proliferation rates, as shown for embryonic tissues and activated lymphocytes (37). Although an elegant study has recently
established that activated lymphocytes rely mainly on MYC to
transcriptionally reprogram their metabolism (38), much less
is known when it comes to epithelial cells.
Our data, generated in a relevant in vivo model, support the
hypothesis that, in response to PI3K activation, nontransformed thyroid epithelial cells increase metabolic ﬂux through

glycolysis, as indicated by the dramatic increase in lactate
production observed in mutant cells; however, this metabolic
switch is independent of thyrocyte proliferation. Metabolic
reprogramming of thyroid epithelial cells is achieved through a
previously unknown mechanism, involving the coordinated
downregulation of the expression of TCA cycle and OXPHOS
genes, and leading to dysfunctional mitochondria and reduced
ability to conduct respiratory metabolism. Although we did not
observe any signiﬁcant increase in the expression of glycolytic
genes (with the exception of Glk) upon Pten loss, we found a
reproducible upregulation of the Glut1 transporter. Accordingly, a strong connection between loss of PTEN expression
and increased expression of GLUT1 has been recently reported
in thyroid tumors discovered during unrelated FDG-PET scans
(39).
Our data are in partial agreement with those recently
reported by Garcia-Cao and colleagues using a mouse model
with enforced whole-body overexpression of Pten (40). Mouse
embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) from these mice display a metabolic shift toward OXPHOS, decreased lactate production,
and increased expression of PGC-1a-target genes. However, in
striking contrast with our model, cells overexpressing Pten
have increased mitochondria number and upregulate PKM2
through mTOR. Although these differences might be linked to
tissue-speciﬁcity of some of the controlling pathways, they
might also be the consequence of overexpressing Pten, which
completely abolishes PI3K signaling. Notably, the expression of
OXPHOS genes in Pten,Pdk1thyr/ mice (in which PI3K signaling is drastically repressed, like in the Pten transgenic
strain) was higher than in WT control, supporting the latter
hypothesis.
From a mechanistic standpoint, our data support a model in
which PI3K activation initiates the remodeling of energy
metabolism through the phosphorylation of AMPK on S485
and its consequent inactivation. AMPK is a kinase known to
play critical roles in growth, metabolism, autophagy, and cell
polarity (41, 42). Its activation requires phosphorylation on
T172 by LKB1 (41). Such phosphorylation can be inhibited by
the AKT- and PKA-mediated phosphorylation of S485 (29, 43)
and by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of S173 (30). A recent
report has shown that also S6K1 can inhibit AMPK by phosphorylating S485 (44). However, the fact that RAD001 treatment of mutant mice does not rescue any of the metabolic
phenotypes despite the complete ablation of S6K activity
argues against a role for S6K1 in the phosphorylation of AMPK,
at least in the thyroid. For the same reason, although mTOR
was found to be central to the glycolytic switch in Tsc2/
mouse kidney tumors and in Pten/ MEFs (23), our in vivo
data clearly show that mTOR activation is dispensable for the
metabolic remodeling of the preneoplastic thyroid.
AMPK has been recently shown to suppress the Warburg
effect in Myc-driven lymphomas, and its genetic inactivation
induces a glycolytic shift in MEFs via normoxic stabilization of
HIF-1a (45). Conversely, we do not detect changes in HIF-1a
protein levels in the thyroids of Ptenthyr/ mice, nor upregulation of Ldha or Aldoa. More importantly, acute AMPK ablation
did not affect OCR in both lymphomas and MEFs, suggesting
the absence of any detrimental effects on the TCA cycle. These

5470

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

differences with our model might be related to the complete
loss of AMPK versus its decreased phosphorylation, or reﬂect
tissue-speciﬁc wiring of the metabolic pathways.
ERRs and PGC-1 are major regulators of the expression of
TCA cycle/OXPHOS genes, and their loss or overexpression
have been shown to lead to repression or induction of these
metabolic targets, respectively (24, 46, 47).
Inactivation of AMPK by AKT results in its inability to
transactivate PGC-1a (25), which in turn leads to lower
levels of ERRa (26). Less clear, instead, is how AMPK
controls the expression of PGC-1b, which lacks the two
residues phosphorylated by AMPK in PGC-1a, and that of
ERRg. Although ERRg downregulation might be directly
responsible for the reduced levels of PGC-1b (24), its link
to PI3K and AMPK is still unclear. It has been recently
reported that ERBB2 upregulates (likely through PI3K)
microRNA (miR)-378 expression in breast cancer cells
(48). In turn, miR-378 targets ERRg, leading to downregulation of TCA cycle genes, reduced respiration rate, and
increased glycolysis. Future studies will evaluate whether
PI3K activation in thyroid cells targets ERRg through miR378 , and whether AMPK plays a role in this pathway.
The fact that AICAR treatment rescued only partially the
expression of mtDNA-encoded genes and the altered mitochondria morphology in Ptenthyr/ mice might be a consequence of the extensive damage sustained by these organelles.
Alternatively, additional PI3K-driven pathways might contribute to this aspect of the phenotype. An additional still open
question is why PKA affects AMPK activity in thyroid cancer
cell lines, but does not seem to do so in vivo, in mouse
thyrocytes. Further work will be needed to clarify these issues.
One important aspect of our ﬁndings is that the metabolic
remodeling seems to contribute directly to the hyperproliferative phenotype, as AICAR-mediated restoration of normal
levels of TCA cycle enzymes and reduction of glycolytic rate
in vivo drastically reduces thyrocyte proliferation. However, we
cannot completely exclude that the reduced proliferation in
AICAR-treated mice is also the consequence of an energydeprived status due to persistent mitochondrial damage and
dysfunction in conditions (i.e., AICAR treatment) that decrease
the metabolic ﬂux through glycolysis.
It is tempting to propose that the noncanonical glycolytic
switch that takes place in preneoplastic PTEN/ cells might
contribute to the neoplastic transformation of thyroid, breast,
and colon epithelial cells in patients with Cowden Disease,
carrying germline PTEN mutations. Similar to SDHB or SDHD
mutation carriers, patients with PTEN-mutant Cowden Disease have recently been found to have elevated plasma succinate (49). The downregulation of succinate dehydrogenases
expression observed in the thyroids of Pten-mutant mice also
results in increased succinate levels (Antico and colleagues,
manuscript in preparation). A similar protransforming contribution might also take place in endometrial epithelial cells in
sporadic type I (endometrioid) endometrial cancer, where loss
of PTEN is the earliest recognized genetic alteration (50).
Because the analysis of early hyperplastic lesions with PI3K
activation in human tissues is not easily feasible, and relevant
expression datasets are not publicly available, to extend our

model to additional human tissues, we used the Oncomine
database, and found several datasets in which PTEN downregulation coexists with global repression of TCA cycle genes.
Interestingly, one of these datasets is derived from early-stage
colorectal cancer (51), supporting our hypothesis that these
metabolic changes may take place well before full neoplastic
transformation. Finally, a recent proteomic and metabolomic
study of gastric cancer, a tumor type often associated with PI3K
activation, found extensive repression of TCA cycle genes (52).
In conclusion, our characterization of an in vivo model of
PI3K activation in thyroid epithelial cells has led to the
discovery of a novel pathway, in which the glycolytic switch
is not achieved through direct upregulation of glycolytic
enzyme expression and activity, but rather through the active
inhibition of AMPK and the consequent repression of the
expression of TCA cycle and OXPHOS genes, leading to the
impairment of mitochondrial metabolism.
