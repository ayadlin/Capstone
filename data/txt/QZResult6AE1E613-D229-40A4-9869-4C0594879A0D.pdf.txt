Abstract
Author Manuscript

EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib are approved treatments
for non-small cell lung cancers harboring activating mutations in the EGFR kinase1,2, but
resistance arises rapidly, most frequently due to the secondary T790M mutation within the ATPsite of the receptor.3,4 Recently developed mutant-selective irreversible inhibitors are highly active
against the T790M mutant5,6, but their efficacy can be compromised by acquired mutation of
C797, the cysteine residue with which they form a key covalent bond7. All current EGFR TKIs
target the ATP-site of the kinase, highlighting the need for therapeutic agents with alternate
mechanisms of action. Here we describe rational discovery of EAI045, an allosteric inhibitor that
targets selected drug-resistant EGFR mutants but spares the wild type receptor. A crystal structure

shows that the compound binds an allosteric site created by the displacement of the regulatory Chelix in an inactive conformation of the kinase. The compound inhibits L858R/T790M-mutant
EGFR with low-nanomolar potency in biochemical assays, but as a single agent is not effective in
blocking EGFR-driven proliferation in cells due to differential potency on the two subunits of the
dimeric receptor, which interact in an asymmetric manner in the active state8. We observe
dramatic synergy of EAI045 with cetuximab, an antibody therapeutic that blocks EGFR
dimerization9,10, rendering the kinase uniformly susceptible to the allosteric agent. EAI045 in
combination with cetuximab is effective in mouse models of lung cancer driven by L858R/T790M
EGFR and by L858R/T790M/C797S EGFR, a mutant that is resistant to all currently available
EGFR TKIs. More generally, our findings illustrate the utility of purposefully targeting allosteric
sites to obtain mutant-selective inhibitors.

Diverse activating mutations within the EGFR kinase domain give rise to a subset of nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). The L858R point mutation and small, in-frame deletions
in the region encoded by exon 19 are the most common mutations, and are among a subset
of oncogenic EGFR alterations that confer enhanced sensitivity to EGFR-directed TKIs11-13.
The dose-limiting toxicity of anilinoquinazoline TKIs such as erlotinib and gefitinib arises
from inhibition of wild type EGFR in the skin and GI tract, thus this enhanced sensitivity
relative to wild type EGFR creates a therapeutic window that allows effective treatment of
patients whose tumors are driven by these mutations. The T790M resistance mutation closes
this window, in part by increasing the affinity of the mutant receptor for ATP, which in turn
diminishes the potency of these ATP-competitive inhibitors14. Mutant-selective irreversible
inhibitors, including the tool compound WZ400215 and and the clinical compounds
osimertinib (AZD9291)6,16 and rociletinib (CO-1686)5, are based on a pyrimidine scaffold,
and also incorporate a Michael acceptor group that forms a covalent bond with Cys797 at
the edge of the ATP binding pocket. Because they bind irreversibly these agents overcome
the enhanced ATP affinity conferred by the T790M mutation. Compounds of this class are
demonstrating significant efficacy against T790M mutant tumors in ongoing clinical
trials17,18, and osimertinib was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
for patients with EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC following progression on prior EGFR TKI
therapy. However, laboratory studies and early clinical experience indicate that the efficacy
of these agents can be compromised by mutation of Cys797, which thwarts formation of the
potency-conferring covalent bond7,15,19.

Reasoning that an allosteric inhibitor could also overcome the enhanced ATP affinity
conferred by the T790M mutation, we screened a ~2.5 million compound library using
purified L858R/T790M EGFR kinase. The biochemical screen was carried out using 1 μM
ATP, and active compounds were counter-screened at 1 mM ATP and against wild type
EGFR to identify those that were potentially non-ATP-competitive and mutant selective.
Among the compounds identified in the screen, EGFR allosteric inhibitor-1 (EAI001, Figure
1a) was of particular interest due to its potency and selectivity for mutant EGFR (IC50 =
0.024 μM for L858R/T790M at 1 mM ATP, IC50 > 50 μM for wild type EGFR). Further
characterization of the mutant-selectivity of EAI001 revealed modest potency against the
isolated L858R and T790M mutants (0.75 μM and 1.7 μM, respectively, Extended Data Fig.
1a). Medicinal chemistry-based optimization of this compound yielded EAI045 (Figure 1a),

a 3 nM inhibitor of the L858R/T790M mutant with ~1000-fold selectivity versus wild type
EGFR at 1 mM ATP (Table 1). Enzyme kinetic characterization confirmed that the
mechanism of inhibition was not competitive with respect to ATP (Table 1, Extended Data
Figure 1b). Profiling of EAI045 against a panel of 250 protein kinases revealed exquisite
selectivity; no other kinases were inhibited by more than 20% at 1 μM EAI045 (Extended
Data Table 1). Evaluation of EAI045 in a safety pharmacology assay panel revealed
excellent selectivity against non-kinase targets as well (Extended Data Table 2).

Author Manuscript

The crystal structure of EAI001 bound to T790M-mutant EGFR showed that the compound
binds in an allosteric pocket that is created in part by the outward displacement of the Chelix in the inactive conformation of the kinase (Fig. 1b,c; Extended Data Table 3). The
compound binds as a “three-bladed propeller” with the aminothiazole moiety inserted
between the mutant gatekeeper methionine and active site residue Lys745. The phenyl
substituent extends into a hydrophobic cleft at the back of the pocket and is in contact with
Leu777 and Phe856. Finally, the 1-oxoisoindolinyl group extends along the C-helix toward
the solvent exposed exterior. The compound also forms a hydrogen bond with Asp855 in the
DFG motif. In further support of a non-ATP competitive mechanism, the ATP-analog AMPPNP is bound in the expected manner in the active site cleft (Fig. 1c).

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, EGFR inhibitors neratinib20 and lapatinib21 extend into the allosteric site and
make interactions that resemble those of two of the three blades of the allosteric agents (Fig.
1d, Extended Data Fig. 2a, c). These ATP-competitive inhibitors are not mutant selective,
and they span both the ATP and allosteric sites. Additionally, we note that the EGFR
allosteric pocket is roughly analogous to a site in MEK1 that is targeted by a number of
allosteric inhibitors that are now approved or in clinical trials22. Despite the similar location
of the MEK allosteric site, there is no structural correspondence in the binding modes of the
respective allosteric inhibitors (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b).
The mutant-specificity of the EGFR allosteric inhibitors arises from at least two effects.
Most obviously, the direct contact of the aminothiazole group with the mutant gatekeeper
methionine residue can explain the selectivity for the T790M mutant. Secondly, the
compound cannot bind the fully inactive conformation of the wild type kinase; simple
modeling reveals steric clashes of EAI001 with Leu858 and Leu861 in the N-terminal
portion of the activation loop (Extended Data Fig. 3). The L858R mutation rearranges this
portion of the activation loop23, thereby enlarging the allosteric pocket. EAI045 may also
inhibit other mutants with a similar mechanism of activation, such as L861Q, but we do not
expect it to inhibit most exon19 deletion variants. These mutations shorten the loop leading
into the C-helix and may therefore prevent opening of the allosteric pocket.

Initial studies of the cellular activity of EAI045 showed that it potently decreased, but did
not completely eliminate EGFR autophosphorylation in H1975 cells, an L858R/T790Mmutant NSCLC cell line (Figure 2a). A similar effect was observed in NIH-3T3 cells stably
transfected with the L858R/T790M mutant (Extended Data Fig. 4a). This inhibition was
selective for mutant EGFR; EAI045 potently inhibited EGFR Y1173 phosphorylation in
H1975 cells (EC50 = 2 nM), but not in HaCaT cells, a keratinocyte cell line with wild type
EGFR (Extended Data Table 4). We observed an intermediate level of activity in the L858R-

mutant H3255 cells, a pattern consistent with our biochemical inhibition data (Extended
Data Table 4). Despite potent inhibition of mutant EGFR, EAI045 showed no antiproliferative effect in the H1975 and H3255 cell lines with concentrations as high as 10 μM
(Extended Data Table 4). Profiling in a panel of EGFR-mutant Ba/F3 cells revealed that
EAI045 inhibited proliferation of L858R/T790M and L858R mutant cells, but not the
exon19del/T790M or parental Ba/F3 cells, indicative of on-target, mutant selective activity
of the allosteric inhibitor (Extended Data Fig. 4b-e). However, half-maximal inhibition
required ~10 μM EAI045, a concentration much higher than the biochemical IC50 of the
compound.

In light of the incomplete inhibition of EGFR autophosphorylation and the allosteric
mechanism of action of EAI045, we wondered to what extent ligand stimulation would
affect inhibition of the mutant receptor. We compared inhibition of EGFR Y1173
phosphorylation in H1975 cells in the presence and absence of exogenous EGF (10 ng/ml)
using an ELISA-based assay. EAI045 inhibited EGFR phosphorylation with a similar EC50
irrespective of EGF stimulation, but strikingly, inhibition plateaued at 50% in the presence
of ligand (Fig. 2b). This phenomenon suggests two populations of receptor, one that remains
sensitive to the allosteric inhibitor upon ligand stimulation, and another, equal in number,
that is rendered insensitive. Ligand-induced dimerization of the EGF receptor is known to
induce an asymmetric interaction of the kinase domains8, and is an obvious potential source
of two receptor populations with differential inhibitor sensitivity.

In the EGFR asymmetric dimer, the C-lobe of the “activator” subunit impinges on the Nlobe of the “receiver” subunit, inducing an active conformation in the receiver by reorienting
the regulatory C-helix to its inward position (Fig. 2c). In wild type EGFR, only the receiver
subunit is activated. By contrast, both subunits in a mutant receptor are expected to be
catalytically active because oncogenic kinase domain mutations induce the active
conformation even in the absence of ligand. As explained above, EAI045 binds a “C-helix
out” conformation of the kinase. In the receiver subunit but not the activator, outward
displacement of the C-helix is impeded by the asymmetric dimer interaction. Therefore we
hypothesized that EAI045 was a potent inhibitor of the activator subunit of the mutant
receptor, but a much less potent inhibitor of the receiver subunit, in which the C-helix is
captive. Because the mutant receptor favors dimer formation24,25, this effect could explain
both the incomplete inhibition of EGFR autophosphorylation and the apparent disconnect in
the biochemical and cellular potencies of the allosteric inhibitor. To test this notion, we
exploited an I941R point mutation in the C-lobe of the kinase, which is known to block the
asymmetric dimer interaction8,26. The activity of the L858R/T790M mutant is dimerizationindependent26, and as expected transduction of Ba/F3 cells with L858R/T790M/I941R
mutant EGFR led to factor-independent proliferation. In support of our hypothesis, Ba/F3
cells bearing this dimerization-defective mutant were dramatically more sensitive to the
allosteric inhibitor (Fig. 2d).
The therapeutic antibody cetuximab targets the extracellular portion of the EGF receptor,
blocking ligand binding and preventing dimer formation9,10. The antibody is not effective
clinically in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, and in cell-based studies cetuximab alone does not
inhibit L858R/T790M or exon19del/T790M mutant EGFR, because their activity is

dimerization independent26. However, we reasoned that cetuximab should synergize with a
kinase-targeted allosteric inhibitor, by converting the inhibitor-resistant receiver population
into a monomeric form that is exquisitely sensitive to EAI045. Strikingly, in the presence of
cetuximab (10 μg/ml), EAI045 inhibited proliferation of L858R/T790M EGFR Ba/F3 cells
with an IC50 of approximately 10 nM, similar to its potency against this mutant in
biochemical assays (Figure 2e). In support of an on-target, mutant-selective effect of the
allosteric agent, proliferation of Ba/F3 cells bearing exon19del/T790M EGFR was not
inhibited by this combination (Fig. 2f).

We next tested the in vivo efficacy of EAI045 in genetically engineered mouse model of
L858R/T790M-mutant lung cancer27, both alone and in combination with cetuximab. Mouse
pharmacokinetic studies with EAI045 revealed a maximal plasma concentration of 0.57 μM,
a half-life of 2.15 h, and oral bioavailability of 26% after dosing at 20 mg/kg. In a 4-week
efficacy study, mice were treated with EAI045 at 60 mg/kg by oral gavage once daily, either
alone or together with cetuximab (1 mg I.P. every other day). We observed striking tumor
regressions in the L858R/T790M-mutant mice treated with the combination, whereas those
treated with EAI045 alone did not respond (Fig. 3a). Cetuximab alone had a very modest
effect in these mice, as previously observed26. Mice bearing exon19del/T790M EGFR were
treated using the same protocol, but as expected failed to respond to the combination therapy
(Fig. 3b). MRI imaging studies of cohorts of L858R/T790M and exon19del/T790M mice
after combination treatment for 1 or 2 weeks are shown in Extended Data Figure 5.

Mutation of C797 is expected to confer resistance to all third-generation irreversible EGFR
inhibitors that are active on the T790M-mutant EGFR, and a preliminary study reported the
C797S alteration in 15/67 patients (22%) with acquired resistance to AZD9291 (ref. 28).
Mutations in C797 should not affect the efficacy of EAI045, as this residue is remote from
the allosteric binding pocket. Consistent with this expectation, EAI045 in combination with
cetuximab potently inhibited L858R/T790M/C797S Ba/F3 cells (Extended Data Fig. 5a) and
treatment of genetically engineered L858R/T790M/C797S mice with the EAI045 and
cetuximab induced marked tumor shrinkage, similar to that observed in the L858R/T790M
models (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 5b). Pharmacodynamic studies performed following 2
doses of treatment demonstrated that EAI045 in combination with cetuximab effectively
inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream signaling proteins in these mice, but
not in mice bearing the insensitive exon19del/T790M mutation (Fig 3d, e).

The compounds we describe here are amongst the first allosteric TKIs, and to our
knowledge, the first targeting any receptor tyrosine kinase in a mutant-selective manner.
Further study is required, but our findings suggest that EAI045 or a related compound in
combination with an EGFR dimer-disrupting antibody such as cetuximab should be an
effective strategy for treating L858R/T790M mutant lung cancers, as well as those with the
triple L858R/T790M/C797S mutation, which are resistant to all current EGFR-targeted
therapies. EAI045 and cetuximab exhibit true mechanistic synergy, a valuable property for
combination agents because it lowers the dose required for efficacy. Ideally,
chemotherapeutic agents used in combination should also be “orthogonal” with respect to
mechanisms of toxicity and sensitivity to resistance mutations. EAI045 meets these criteria
as well; its lack of activity on wild type EGFR and other kinases suggest that its dose-

limiting toxicity is unlikely to be related to that of cetuximab and ATP-competitive EGFR
inhibitors. In addition, given its distinct binding site, its sensitivity to resistance-conferring
mutations is expected to be divergent from that of both cetuximab and ATP-site inhibitors.
For these reasons, we speculate that an allosteric agent like EAI045 could be used in
combination with ATP-site directed inhibitors, with the goal of preventing the emergence of
treatment-associated resistance mutations in the receptor itself.

Methods
EGFR protein expression and purification

Author Manuscript

Constructs spanning residues 696-1022 of the human EGFR (including wild type, L858R,
L858R/T790M, T790M, and T790M/V948R mutant sequences) were prepared in a GSTfusion format using the pTriEX system (Novagen) for expression in Sf9 insect cells
essentially as described14,23. EGFR kinase proteins were purified by glutathione-affinity
chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography after cleavage with TEV or
thrombin to remove the GST fusion partner following established procedures14,23.
High-throughput screening
Purified EGFR-L858R/T790M enzyme was screened against Novartis compound collection
of ~2.5 million using HTRF-based biochemical assay format. The screening was performed
at 1 μM ATP using a single compound concentration (12.5 μM). 1322 top hits were picked
for follow-up IC50 confirmation. IC50 values were determined at both 1 μM and 1 mM ATP
to identify both ATP competitive and non-competitive compounds. Hits were also counterscreened against wild type EGFR to evaluate the mutant selectivity.

Author Manuscript

HTRF-based EGFR biochemical assays
Biochemical assays for wild type EGFR and each mutant were carried out using a
homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay as described previously29. Assays
were optimized for each ATP concentration. Compound IC50 values were determined by 12point inhibition curves (from 50 to 0.000282 μM) in duplicate.
Structure determination

Author Manuscript

Prior to crystallization, 0.1 mM of EGFR-T790M/V948R was incubated for 1 hour with 0.5
mM EAI001, 1 mM Adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate (AMP-PNP) and 10 mM MgCl2
at room temperature. Crystals of T790M/V948R EGFR in complex with EAI001 were
prepared by hanging-drop vapor diffusion method over a reservoir solution containing 0.1M
Bis-Tris pH5.5, 25% PEG 3350, 5mM tris (2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP). Crystals
were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after rapid immersion in a cryoprotectant solution
containing 0.1M Bis-Tris 5.5, 25% PEG3350, 10% ethylene glycol and 5mM TCEP.
Diffraction data were recorded using a Mar343 image plate detector on a rotating anode
source at 100K. Data were processed and merged as described previously14. The structure
was determined by molecular replacement with the program PHASER using an inactive
EGFR kinase structure (PDB 2GS7) as the search model. Repeated rounds of manual
refitting and crystallographic refinement were performed using COOT and REFMAC. The
inhibitor was modeled into the closely fitting positive Fo-Fc electron density and then

crystallization was racemic, the density clearly corresponded to the R stereoisomer and was
modeled accordingly. Topology and parameter files for the inhibitors were generated using

previously described15,27. The EGFR-L858R/T790M/C797S (named as TLCS thereafter)
mutant mouse cohort was established briefly as follows: The full-length HuTLCS cDNA
was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quickchange site directed mutagenesis
kit (Agilent Technologies) and further verified by DNA sequencing. Sequence-verified
targeting vectors were co-electroporated with an FLPe recombinase plasmid into v6.5
C57BL/6J (female) x 129/sv (male) embryonic stem cells (Open Biosystems) as described
elsewhere31. Resulting hygromycin-resistant embryonic stem clones were evaluated for
transgene integration via PCR. Then, transgene-positive embryonic stem clones were
injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and the resulting chimeras were mated with BALB/c wild
type mice to determine germline transmission of the TLCS transgene. Further detail on the
generation and characterization of the TLCS transgenic mice is provided in Supplementary
Figure 3. Progeny of TL, TD and TLCS mice were genotyped by PCR of tail DNA. The TL
and TD mice were fed a doxycycline diet at 6 weeks of age to induce EGFR TL or TD
expression, respectively. The TLCS mice were intranasally instilled with Ad-Cre (University
of Iowa viral vector core) at 6 weeks of age to excise the loxP sites, activating EGFR TLCS
expression.

The EAI045 compound was dissolved in 10% NMP (10% 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone: 90%
PEG-300), and was dosed at 60 mg/kg daily by oral gavage. Cetuximab was administrated at
1 mg/mouse every other day by intraperitoneal injection. The TL, TD and TLCS mice were
monitored by MRI to quantify lung tumor burden before being assigned to various study
treatment cohorts, which were non-blinded and not formally randomized. All treated mice
had an equal initial tumor burden. MRI evaluation was repeated every 2 weeks during
treatment. The animals were imaged with a rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement
sequence (TR = 2000 ms, TE effect = 25 ms) in the coronal and axial planes with a 1-mm
slice thickness gating with respiratory rates. The detailed procedure for MRI scanning has
been previously described27. The tumor burden volumes were quantified using 3dimensional Slicer software. Source data for tumor volume measurements are provided in
Supplementary Figure 2.

All care of experimental animals was in accordance with Harvard Medical School/DanaFarber Cancer Institute institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) guidelines. All
mice were housed in a pathogen-free environment at a DFCI animal facility and handled in
strict accordance with Good Animal Practice as defined by the Office of Laboratory Animal
Welfare. None of the tumor efficacy experiments presented in this manuscript exceeded the
2cm maximal diameter tumor size as permitted by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute IACUC.
Synthesis and characterization of EAI045
2-(5-fluoro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(1-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-2-yl)-N-(1,3thiazol-2-yl)acetamide—(EAI045) was prepared from 2-amino-2-(5-fluoro-2methoxyphenyl)acetic acid using a reaction sequence similar to that previously described (G.
W. Muller, US Patent #5,698,579) followed by demethylation with boron tribromide.

a, Structure of EAI001 in complex with EGFR for comparison. b, Structure of MEK1 kinase
bound to allosteric inhibitor GDC0973 (PDB 4AN2). GDC0973 (also called XL518) and
other allosteric MEK inhibitors occupy a pocket created by displacement of the C-helix in
the inactive conformation of the kinase. Most allosteric MEK inhibitors make hydrogen
bond interactions with the γ-phosphate group of ATP that are important for their potency.
The allosteric EGFR inhibitors we describe here bind in a generally analogous location in
EGFR, but lack any clear structural similarity to MEK inhibitors and do not contact the γNature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 November 25.

Both lapatinib and neratinib (see Fig. 1d in the main text) bind an inactive conformation of
the kinase. Like gefitinib and erlotinib, both occupy the ATP site, but also extend into the
allosteric pocket occupied by EAI001. Note that like neratinib, lapatinib places aromatic
phenyl or pyridinyl groups in positions similar to those occupied by the aminothiazole and
phenyl substituents of EAI001.

Extended Data Figure 3. EAI001 binding is incompatible with the inactive conformation of WT
EGFR

Author Manuscript

Superposition of the EAI001/EGFR structure reported here with the structure of WT EGFR
kinase in the inactive conformation (gray, PDB ID 2GS7). EAI001 (shown with carbon
atoms in green) clashes with the side chains of leucines 858 and 861 in the WT EGFR
structure. These leucine residues lie in a short helical segment at the N-terminus of the
activation loop. The L858R substitution disrupts this helix. We propose that this effect
explains, in part, the selectivity of the allosteric inhibitor for the L858R/T790M mutant.
Note that EAI001 was crystallized with the T790M/V948R mutant EGFR, as we were
unable to obtain crystals with the L858R/T790M or L858R/T790M/V948R proteins. The
compound induces unstructuring of the activation loop helix and repositions L858, which is
in contact with the 1-oxoisoindolinyl group of the inhibitor. The location and conformation
of the inhibitor is expected to be the same in the context of the L858R mutation, but the
details of the interaction with this portion of the activation loop will necessarily differ due to
the mutation.

Figure 1. Structure and binding mode of allosteric EGFR inhibitors

Author Manuscript

a, Chemical structures of EAI001 and EAI045. b, Overall view of the structure of T790M/
V948R EGFR bound to EAI001 and AMP-PNP. EAI001 is shown in CPK form with carbon
atoms in green. The V948R substitution was introduced to allow crystallization of the kinase
in an inactive conformation8. c, Detailed view of the interactions of EAI001. A hydrogen
bond with Asp855 in the “DFG” segment of the kinase is shown as a dashed red line. d, The
structure of irreversible inhibitor neratinib bound to EGFR T790M (PDB ID 2JIV).
Neratinib occupies the ATP site, but also extends into the allosteric pocket occupied by
EAI001.

EGFR in which only the receiver subunit is active, both subunits are catalytically active in
the L858R/T790M mutant. The activator subunit is more readily inhibited by allosteric
agents (yellow star), because the C-helix can be readily displaced. By contrast, opening the
allosteric pocket in the receiver subunit requires perturbing the dimer. Thus mutations that
disrupt the asymmetric dimer (such as I941R, blue circle) or antibodies that block
dimerization (cetuximab) should enhance the potency of allosteric agents. d, Inhibition of
proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing L858R/T790M and L858R/T790M/I941R by
EAI045. Addition of the dimer-disrupting I941R mutation markedly sensitizes to inhibition
by EAI045. e and f, Treatment of EGFR-Mutant Ba/F3 cells with EAI045 alone, in
combination with cetuximab (10 μg/ml), or with cetuximab alone. Note the dramatic synergy
with cetuximab that is observed only in the L858R/T790M model.

Figure 3. EAI045 in combination with cetuximab induces tumor regression in genetically
engineered mouse models of EGFR-mutant lung cancer

a, Mice bearing L858R/T790M mutant tumors were treated with EAI045 alone (n=5),
cetuximab alone (n=3) or both agents in combination (n=10). Tumor volumes were
measured using MRI 4 weeks after initiation of treatment and are plotted for each animal in
a “waterfall” format. b, As in panel a, but in mice bearing exon19del/T790M mutant tumors
(n=4, 4 and 4). c, As in panel a, but in mice bearing L858R/T790M/C797S mutant tumors
