Abstract
Emerging evidence suggests that the survival of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells is dependent on microenvironmental influences such as antigenic stimulation and support by stromal cells. Akt, also
known as protein kinase B, is a central component in prosurvival signaling downstream of these events. We
investigated the role of Akt and its modulation by the protooncogene T-cell leukemia 1a (Tcl1a) in the
survival pathways of primary CLL samples and CLL-derived prolymphocytic cell lines MEC-1 and MEC-2.
Akt activation was increased by the protective presence of human bone marrow stromal cells and B-cell
receptor mimicking signals but antagonized by direct Akt blockade with the novel specific inhibitor AiX, with
preferential apoptosis induction in CLL cells with an unmutated immunoglobulin status, which predicts poor
clinical outcome. In addition, we found a direct interaction of Akt with Tcl1a in an endogenous coimmunoprecipitation assay. Confirming the critical role of Tcl1a in modulating Akt signaling, Akt activation was
enhanced by overexpressing Tcl1a in CLL. In contrast, decreasing Tcl1a levels by small interfering RNA reduced Akt activation in the fludarabine-insensitive CLL cell line MEC-2 and sensitized the malignant cells to
fludarabine treatment. In summary, our data reveal a significant role for the Akt-Tcl1a axis in CLL survival
and propose a further evaluation of this interplay for targeting chemoresistance phenomena. Cancer Res; 70(18);

Introduction
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most
prevalent non–Hodgkin lymphoma in the Western world
and is characterized by the accumulation of CD5+ B lymphocytes in the blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow (BM). The
clinical course and outcome of CLL varies considerably.
Some patients progress rapidly and die early despite therapy,
whereas others exhibit an indolent disease course and a normal life span (1). Emerging evidence suggests that the B-cell
antigen receptor (BCR) is the major determinant of this differential outcome. In particular, patients carrying mutated
(MUT) variable heavy chain region genes encoding the
surface immunoglobulin component of the BCR (IgVH) genAuthors' Affiliations: 1 Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular

erally follow a more indolent course than those with unmutated (UMT) IgVH genes, who also tend to show evidence of
adverse cytogenetic features, clonal evolution, and resistance
to therapy (2, 3). In addition, molecular markers that are
associated with the signaling capacity of the BCR in CLL,
such as CD38 and the ζ-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70), serve
as indicators for poor clinical prognosis (reviewed in ref. 4).
In normal B lymphocytes, BCR stimulation triggers the
recruitment and activation of Syk kinases, followed by the
activation of effector enzymes, including protein kinase C
(PKC), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase Cγ2. These signaling complexes regulate key downstream pathways such as extracellular signal-regulated
kinase, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, p38, and Akt, the outcomes of which determine the B-cell fate (5). The serine/
threonine kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B, is a
central molecule in the transmission of antigenic BCRderived signals. Several studies suggested that Akt activation
promotes CLL cell survival following BCR engagement (6, 7).
It is, however, controversially discussed whether in peripheral blood CLL cells, constitutively active Akt contributes
to cell survival (6, 8–11).
The protooncogene T-cell leukemia 1a (Tcl1a) is an
important modulator of Akt activity. Tcl1a was initially characterized in preleukemic T cells (12) but is also expressed in
subsets of naïve lymphocytes (13). Tcl1a protein is expressed
in 90% of human CLL samples at variable levels correlating
with ZAP-70 expression, IgVH mutational status, and cytogenetic aberrations (14). Tcl1a can form a hetero-oligomeric

CLL Apoptosis by Akt Modulation

protein complex with Akt, thereby serving as a coactivator of
Akt (15, 16). The significance of the Akt-Tcl1a axis is further
underlined by the fact that TCL1A-transgenic mice expand a
CD5+/IgM+ lymphocyte population, which is reminiscent of
human CLL (17) and is accompanied by increased Akt activation levels (18). Intriguingly, these mice have a high-risk
phenotype resembling the typical molecular features of an
UMT BCR of human CLL cells.
Direct interference in Akt activation by specific Akt inhibitors or modulation of the coactivator Tcl1a has not been
extensively investigated thus far. We analyzed these aspects
in the context of BCR-related signaling and the tumor
microenvironment—two elements centrally involved in survival and progression of CLL. We found a significant role for the
Akt-Tcl1a axis in CLL cell survival. Our results warrant a further evaluation of this interplay as a therapeutic target in CLL.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies
The Akt inhibitor 10-(4′-(N-diethylamino)butyl)-2-chlorophenoxazine, HCl (AiX) was purchased from Calbiochem,
the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and U0126 were from Cell Signaling Technology, and 2-fluoroadenine-9-β-D-arabinofuranoside and rottlerin were from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies
against Akt1, pan-Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser473), phosphoserine
glycogen synthase kinase 3α/β (GSK3α/β), Mcl-1, Tcl1a,
Bid, and Bik were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology;
antibodies against Akt2, MDM2, p53, and phospho–Bcl-2
(Ser70) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Puma and tubulin were from Sigma-Aldrich; antibodies against CD5-PC7,
CD19-phycoerythrin (PE), and CD19-PC7 were from BeckmanCoulter; VLA-4 (CD49d)-PE was from BD Biosciences; and
CD38-PE was from Immunotech.
Patients, cell preparation, and AiX treatment
Following informed consent, peripheral blood samples
were obtained from patients fulfilling diagnostic and immunophenotypic criteria for CLL at the Salzburg University Hospital, Austria (Supplementary Table S1). Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by density gradient
centrifugation and cultured in complete RPMI 1640. To generate primary BM-derived stromal cells, adherent mononuclear cells from CLL BM aspirates were cultured for 3 weeks in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1 μmol/L hydrocortisone and
100 μmol/L β-mercaptoethanol. For coculture experiments
including risk stratification, BM-derived stromal cells from
healthy donors were kindly provided by Reinhard Henschler
(Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immune Hematology,
German Red Cross Blood Donor Service, Frankfurt, Germany).

Analysis of cell viability, Tcl1a expression, and
Akt activation
Cells were stained with fluorochrome-labeled anti-CD5,
anti-CD19, Annexin V, and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD),
and at least 10,000 CLL cells were analyzed using a FC-500
flow cytometer and CXP2-2 software (Beckman-Coulter).
For intracellular phospho-Akt (Ser473) and Tcl1a staining,
cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Fix and Perm
kit (AN DER GRUBB) and stained with isotype control,
anti-Tcl1a, anti–phosphoserine Akt, or anti–pan-Akt (19).
Plasmid construction and transfection
TCL1A wild-type cDNA was PCR amplified and subcloned
into pcDNA3.1 vectors (Clontech). For cloning, the following
PCR primers with EcoRI and SalI restriction sites were used:
GTGGAATTCGCCATGGCCGAGTGCCCGACACTCGGG
(forward) and GTGGTCGACTCAGTCATCTGGCAGCAGCTCGAGAAG (reverse). Plasmids were nucleofected into MEC-1
cells using the Human B Cell Nucleofector kit (Lonza
Cologne AG). Transfected cells were selected by geneticin.
Small interfering RNA transfection
MEC-2 cells were transfected with 100 pmol small interfering RNA (siRNA) using Metafectene Pro (Biontex GmbH)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assessment
of transfection efficacy was monitored by transfecting an
Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated nontargeting siRNA and flow
cytometric analysis, and effective protein knockdown was
densitometrically assessed.
Immunoblot analysis
Standard lysis buffer was supplemented with phosphatase
(Roche) and protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). For coimmunoprecipitation, a buffer containing 0.3% CHAPS was
used (20). The lysate protein concentration was determined
using the Bio-Rad protein assay. For coimmunoprecipitation,
lysates were precleared with 50 μL protein A or G dynabeads
(Invitrogen) and further incubated with the antibody overnight. Magnetically captured complexes were washed and
analyzed by immunoblotting. Signals were detected by
chemiluminescence using the enhanced chemiluminescence
kit (Millipore).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
5.0 or SPSS 17.0. All data were tested for normal distribution,
and t test or ANOVA and Bonferroni post test were
performed for normally distributed data. For nonnormally
distributed data, the Mann-Whitney test was used.

Results
Cell lines
HS-5 stromal cells and C7H2-CEM cells were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection, and MEC-1
and MEC-2 cells were from the German Resource Centre
for Biological Material. Cell lines were cultured according
to the supplier's instructions, and cell aliquots from early
passages (P1–P10) were used.

Direct Akt inhibition induces CLL apoptosis that
cannot be compensated by protective stimuli
We first tested the in vitro effect of the novel Akt inhibitor
AiX on CLL survival. AiX has been previously shown to effectively inhibit Akt and Akt downstream target phosphorylation
without influencing the activity of PI3K and other Akt-related

kinases (21). We treated randomly selected CLL samples
with increasing concentrations of AiX for 24 hours and
subsequently assessed CLL cell viability by flow cytometry following Annexin V/7-AAD staining. AiX decreased Akt phosphorylation and CLL cell viability in a dose-dependent and
effective manner (Fig. 1A; data not shown) with an IC50 value
of 4.4 μmol/L. Comparison of apoptosis rates induced by
either AiX or the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 showed similar
effectivity at 5 μmol/L but dramatically higher effectivity of
AiX at 10 μmol/L (P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. S1). For discrimination between AiX-induced apoptosis and necrosis, we
additionally monitored for caspase-dependent cleavage of the
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein, internucleoso-

mal DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activity as commonly
used indicators for apoptosis. Akt inhibition resulted in high
levels of cleaved PARP and DNA ladder formation, suggesting
induction of apoptosis rather than necrosis (Supplementary
Fig. S2A and B). We also observed increased caspase-3 activity
in CLL cells after AiX treatment, which could be mostly
blocked by preincubation with the pan-caspase inhibitor
Q-VD-OPH (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
CLL cell survival ex vivo critically depends on the presence
of supportive accessory cells such as BM-derived stromal
cells. Conventional in vitro culture conditions without these
accessory cells usually result in a rapid decline in CLL cell
viability. Concordantly, we observed that CLL cells cocultured

with the human stromal cell line HS-5 displayed significant
increased survival (Fig. 1B, left). Notably, this stromalinduced prosurvival effect correlated with increased Akt
phosphorylation in the same CLL cells (n = 5, correlation
coefficient r2 = 0.81, P = 0.032; Fig. 1B, right) and could be
completely countered by treatment with AiX (data not
shown). As we wished to determine if Akt inhibition of the
CLL cells or rather the reduced viability of the stromal cells
accounted for the decline in stromal-mediated protective
effects, we assessed the viability of the HS-5 cells on AiX
treatment. We observed a slight reduction in HS-5 viability
in response to ≥5 μmol/L AiX (data not shown). Therefore,
we repeated these experiments using primary patientderived BM stromal cells, which were resistant to AiX treatment. Strikingly, coculture of CLL cells with primary stromal
cells almost completely protected CLL cells against spontaneous apoptosis during the whole culture period of 5 days
(Fig. 1C, left). The median viability of CLL cells after 5 days
of in vitro culture in the absence of stromal cells was 25.3%
compared with 91.4% in the presence of the CLL BMderived stromal cells. However, despite this strong protective effect, Akt inhibition was highly efficient in inducing
CLL apoptosis without affecting stromal cell viability
(Fig. 1C, right).

Besides the stromal microenvironment, antigenic input is
one of the most relevant factors in CLL survival (22). We
recently showed a critical role of PKCβ, a molecule centrally
involved in BCR signaling, in CLL development (23). We now
stimulated CLL cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA), thereby mimicking a PKCβ signal (24). This stimulation resulted in strong Akt phosphorylation at Ser473, a major
and for full activation indispensable phosphorylation site (25),
which was entirely reversible by AiX treatment (Fig. 2A). We
confirmed the PKCβ mimicking nature of PMA stimulation
by use of enzastaurin. This PKCβ-specific inhibitor, but not
the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the PKCθ inhibitor rottlerin,
antagonized PMA-induced Akt activation (Fig. 2A), as previously observed (23). PMA stimulation led to a significant
increase in CLL cell viability but failed to inhibit AiX-induced
apoptosis (Fig. 2B). Determining the molecular basis of this
observation, we found a dramatic activation of the Akt
signaling pathway on PMA stimulation, such as increased
levels of phosphoserine GSK3α/β and strong upregulation
of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, which was mostly antagonized by AiX treatment. Expression of the direct Akt
modulator Tcl1a was not visibly affected by PMA stimulation
or direct Akt inhibition (Fig. 2C). Importantly, Akt inhibition
was efficient in antagonizing PMA-induced Bcl-2 Ser 70

phosphorylation, recently reported to be crucial for CLL survival (26). In addition, proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bid
and Bik were upregulated in the presence of Akt inhibition
(Fig. 2C).
We additionally checked the involvement of the p53 signaling pathway because p53 dysfunction is a primary
determinant of CLL chemoresistance (27, 28). Furthermore,
protein expression of MDM2, the main counter player of
p53, is regulated by Akt signaling (29, 30). MDM2 expression was increased on PMA stimulation but decreased with
additional AiX treatment, coinciding with apoptosis.
Expression levels of p53 and its downstream target Puma
were also increased on PMA. The observation that we
could modulate p53 pathway members by PMA or AiX
treatment led us to investigate the influence of the
PKCβ/Akt axis on the fludarabine responsiveness of CLL
cells. Whereas fludarabine treatment resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability of unstimulated cells, the
same concentration did not affect the viability of PMAstimulated cells, further supporting the involvement of
the PKCβ/Akt/Mcl-1 axis in CLL survival and chemoresistance (Fig. 2D). Concordantly, when we tested the sensitivity of fludarabine-resistant CLL samples to Akt inhibition,

we observed clear apoptosis induction by AiX. All samples
displayed a 17p13 deletion in 40% to 90% of the cells,
resulting in p53 dysfunction. Importantly, AiX treatment
was similarly effective in these fludarabine-resistant cells
(n = 4) and normal samples (n = 7, P = 0.9972; Supplementary Fig. S3).
High-risk CLL cells are more sensitive toward
Akt inhibition than low-risk cells
We further analyzed AiX-induced apoptosis in different
CLL subgroups. Stratification of patients' samples according
to their molecular risk profile (marked in Supplementary
Table S1) revealed that in solo culture, CLL cells with an
UMT IgVH status were significantly more sensitive to treatment with AiX than those with a MUT status (Fig. 3A, left).
Furthermore, AiX also preferentially killed CLL cells with
high CD38 and VLA-4 expression (Fig. 3B and C, left), consistent with the association of these molecules with poor clinical outcome (2, 31, 32). Spontaneous apoptosis during
in vitro culture did not differ between CLL subgroups. In
the presence of stromal cells, Akt inhibition was very effective with a trend of preferential targeting UMT but not VLA4–high cases (Fig. 3C, right). Due to this observation, we

determined basal Akt substrate phosphorylation and Tcl1a
levels in UMT versus MUT CLL subgroups. As expected,
UMT CLL cells significantly displayed higher Akt activity
and Tcl1a levels than MUT CLL cells (Fig. 3D).
The Tcl1a/Akt interaction axis is involved in
fludarabine resistance of a CLL-derived
prolymphocytic cell line
The expression of Tcl1a reciprocally correlates with the
IgVH mutational status and is centrally involved in CLL
tumorigenesis (14, 33, 34). Furthermore, Tcl1a is an important modulator of Akt activity with a central role in transmission of antigenic BCR-derived signals (35). Having observed
significantly higher Tcl1a levels in UMT than MUT CLL cells,
we next addressed the role of the Tcl1a/Akt interplay in CLL
survival and chemosensitivity. Therefore, we used MEC-1
and MEC-2 CLL-derived prolymphocytic cells displaying
different Tcl1a expression levels with higher Tcl1a expression
in MEC-2 cells. Increased Tcl1a expression correlated with
increased levels of phosphoserine Akt and GSK3 in MEC-2
cells (Fig. 4A). We tested the sensitivity of these cells
toward Akt inhibition. AiX decreased MEC cell viability in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). After treatment with
20 μmol/L AiX, 50% of the MEC-1 cells and 65% of the
MEC-2 cells underwent apoptosis (a fraction of 0.5 and 0.65
compared with untreated control cells, respectively).
To determine whether this higher constitutive Akt phosphorylation of MEC-2 is a consequence of Tcl1a/Akt interaction, we next examined for direct Tcl1a/Akt protein-protein
interaction. Three isoforms of Akt have been described: Akt1,
Akt2, and Akt3. We observed Akt1 and Akt2 expression in
MEC-1 and MEC-2 cells but did not detect Akt3 (Fig. 4C; data
not shown). Performing endogenous coimmunoprecipitation
experiments, we observed direct protein-protein interaction
of Tcl1a and Akt (Fig. 4C). Tcl1a coimmunoprecipitated with
both Akt1 and Akt2 isoforms in lysates of the Tcl1a-high CLL
cell line MEC-2. No coimmunoprecipitation of Tcl1a was
observed when lysates of the Tcl1a-negative CEM cell line
or anti–cytochrome c IgG were used in control experiments.
Although Akt1 is the more predominant isoform found in
MEC-2 cells, quantitatively more Tcl1a was bound to Akt2
(Fig. 4C). Next, to investigate the direct effect of Tcl1a
on Akt activity, we knocked down Tcl1a expression in
MEC-2 cells by siRNA. The efficacy of the transfection procedure was cytometrically assessed by nontargeting siRNA.
Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell viability was not
negatively affected and ∼90% of MEC-2 cells were transfected (Supplementary Fig. S4). This transfection rate translated into a 70% knockdown of the Tcl1a protein (Tcl1a
siRNA compared with nontargeting siRNA) and resulted in
decreased Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). Following the observation of impaired Akt signaling connected to
reduced Tcl1a levels, we next investigated whether overexpressing Tcl1a would enhance Akt activation in MEC-1 cells.
A plasmid encoding the human TCL1A cDNA was introduced
into MEC-1 cells. This resulted in an activation of Akt and
its downstream target GSK3α/β (Fig. 5B), further confirming the indispensable function of Tcl1a in Akt-mediated

Akt-dependent signaling in CLL survival, we investigated
a potential Tcl1a function in chemosensitivity of these
cells. MEC-2 cells have a monoallelic deletion in 17p13
(36), resulting in fludarabine resistance based on attenuation but not complete abrogation of the p53 pathway. We
confirmed residual p53 activity by showing increased
expression of the p53 downstream target p21 following AiX
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5). Finally, we performed a

Discussion
Akt is a central protagonist in signal transduction pathways
involved in cell differentiation, migration, proliferation, and
survival, with innumerable regulatory circuits operating within and between these functions (37). Moreover, Akt is involved
in malignant cell transformation and in the development of
tumor chemoresistance (38). For these reasons, modulation
of Akt activity through inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), its main upstream activator, has long been
deemed an attractive therapeutic approach, and a range of
different PI3K inhibitors has been developed in recent years
for several tumor entities. However, thus far, lack of selectivity
and solubility of these inhibitors has limited their use in clinical trials (37). Constitutive PI3K activation has been shown in
freshly prepared CLL cells, suggesting that the PI3K/Akt axis
is relevant in CLL pathogenesis (8, 9, 39). In addition, we
and others showed that Akt can also be activated by PI3Kindependent pathways, such as PKCβ (23, 39), recently shown
to regulate the outcome of BCR signals and CLL tumorigenesis (23, 40). Likewise, stabilization of the Akt kinase activity by
the oncoprotein Tcl1a (41) is believed to contribute to the
development of the CD5+ B-cell malignancy observed in the
TCL1A-transgenic mouse model (17, 18). Furthermore, this
Tcl1a overexpression can partly compensate for the loss of
PKCβ presumably by providing the missing Akt amplification
signal in the malignant cell population (23). Surprisingly,
although Akt-driven pathways play an important role in
CLL tumorigenesis (6, 7, 10), the effects of direct Akt targeting
or modulation of its interplay with its coactivator Tcl1a have
not been widely addressed in CLL thus far.
We show here that direct inhibition of Akt by AiX even
under conditions that normally confer protection to these
cells, such as survival signals emanating from the tumor
microenvironment and signals mimicking sustained antigenic input, induced apoptosis of CLL cells. As CLL cells display
an extended life span within the context of their immediate
tumor microenvironment, but rapidly undergo spontaneous
apoptosis ex vivo, increasing emphasis is being placed on
these leukemic cell-microenvironment interactions (42).
Concordantly, coculturing CLL cells with accessory cells
(43) or activation of the BCR signaling pathway (7, 23) rescues the malignant cells from succumbing rapidly to apoptosis ex vivo. Importantly, these prosurvival signals may
converge on the Akt signaling pathway (6). Indeed, we show
that both stromal- and BCR-related prosurvival stimuli result
in Akt activation and that inhibition of Akt effectively overcomes these protective signals. The data indicate that direct
Akt targeting can kill not only the bulk of the tumor cells
circulating in the blood but also those residing within protective BM niches. Considering the pivotal role these niches play
in the development of chemoresistance and disease relapse,
our results underscore the potential value of Akt inhibitors in
the treatment of CLL.
Furthermore, we show that direct Akt inhibition leads to
strong proapoptotic effects especially in high-risk samples
and is also effective in chemoresistant cases. In the presence
of primary stromal cells, Akt inhibition was very potent with

CLL Apoptosis by Akt Modulation

a trend of preferential targeting in those cases with an UMT
IgVH status. In light of increased Tcl1a levels of these cells,
we assume that their increased reliance on an activated Akt
pathway downstream of the BCR (6, 7) renders them more
sensitive toward Akt inhibition. These risk-specific differences in BCR signaling capacity could be overruled by PKCβ
activation. Indeed, PKCβ stimulation with PMA resulted in
high phospho-Akt levels as well as increased cell viability
and chemoresistance to fludarabine regardless of the risk
group. PMA-induced survival benefits were based on elevated
levels of Mcl-1 and activated (phospho-)Bcl-2 (Fig. 2) with
simultaneous reduction of BimEL (data not shown). CLL
cells exist in a delicate balance between the proapoptotic
and prosurvival members of the Bcl-2 protein family. High
levels of prosurvival Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, along with high levels
of proapoptotic Bcl-xL, Bax, Bim, and Bmf, have been
observed in the majority of CLL cells (44, 45). Our data support the described role of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in CLL cell survival
and drug resistance (6, 7, 26). Furthermore, chemoresistance
in CLL is largely dependent on loss of p53 function, in the
form of 17p13 deletion, which also represents one of the
worst prognostic markers in CLL (46–48). Interestingly, we
observed that activation of the BCR pathway using PMA
led to increased protein levels of MDM2 and p53, as well
as induction of p53 target Puma. However, simultaneous
activation of Akt and Mcl-1 by PMA could effectively suppress the proapoptotic activity of these proteins (Fig. 2C).
In support of this, the strong downregulation of Mcl-1 by
Akt inhibition combined with simultaneous increase in proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bid and Bik resulted in apoptosis
even in PMA-stimulated CLL cells. Our observation on Bid
cleavage on Akt inhibition may indicate the involvement of
the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, as Bid conjoins the extrinsic
and intrinsic apoptotic pathways via caspase-8. As we indeed
observed caspase-8 activation after Akt inhibition (data not
shown), it is likely that both apoptotic pathways are involved.
Our data are in line with coincidental Bid cleavage and
caspase-8 activation after inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway
in different lymphoma entities (49, 50).
Importantly, Akt inhibition also induced apoptosis in CLL
cells with p53 deletion or dysfunction (Supplementary
Fig. S3), an observation in consensus with a recent report
(11). Therefore, our results show that targeting Akt by specific small molecules represents a rational strategy to combat
not only high-risk but also therapy-resistant CLL entities,
including those with p53 dysfunction.
Besides direct Akt inhibition, disruption of the Akt interaction with its coactivator Tcl1a can represent a valuable

therapeutic approach. Expression of Tcl1a has been observed
in 90% of human CLL samples, with higher levels correlating
with an UMT IgVH status and ZAP-70 expression (14). Moreover, higher Tcl1a levels predict for an inferior clinical outcome likely by modulating Akt activation (33). To show the
utility of a modulating approach, we made use of CLL cell–
derived lines that differed intrinsically in their expression
of Tcl1a. Concordantly, we found more Akt activation and
higher AiX response rates with regard to cell death in high
Tcl1a-expressing MEC-2 cells than in MEC-1 cells (Fig. 4).
Of note, overexpression of myr-Akt1 in CLL cells increased
leukemic cell size (6), which is an interesting observation,
as Akt-active MEC-2 cells have a bigger cell size than MEC1 cells. Moreover, we are the first to report the coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous Tcl1a with Akt1 and Akt2 in the
CLL cell line MEC-2, as direct Tcl1a-Akt interaction has only
ever been shown in cell lines engineered to overexpress Tcl1a
(35). Condordant with our results, Tcl1a was shown to be
corecruited with pan-Akt in BCR-activated CLL cells (33).
RNA interference with Tcl1a in these cells led to reduced
Akt activation and enhanced response toward cytotoxic
treatment such as fludarabine. In contrast, overexpression
of TCL1A in low Tcl1a-expressing MEC-1 cells led to
enhanced phosphoserine Akt and GSK3α/β levels (Fig. 5).
Collectively, our data show the central role of the prosurvival
kinase Akt and its coactivator Tcl1a in the survival of stimulated CLL cells, which otherwise would be protected from
treatment with cytotoxic agents such as fludarabine, and
suggest that interference of this signaling axis represents a
potential therapeutic strategy to combat CLL.
