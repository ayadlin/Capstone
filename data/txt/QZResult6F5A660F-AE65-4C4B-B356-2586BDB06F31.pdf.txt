BACKGROUND. The current study was conducted to examine the outcomes of
pneumonectomy after induction chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally
advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

METHODS. All patients undergoing pneumonectomy after induction therapy at
the Brigham and Women’s Hospital were retrospectively evaluated for 30-day and
100-day mortality and treatment-related complications with Institutional Review
Board approval. Multivariate and univariate analyses for clinical factors correlating with toxicity and/or survival were calculated.

RESULTS. Between 1995 and 2005, 73 patients underwent pneumonectomy for

With a median follow-up of 28 months, the 1-year and 2-year overall survival
were 6% and 10%, respectively. Only 4 of 73 patients (6%) died of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The rate of nonfatal treatment-related morbidity was
11%. On univariate analysis, right-sided pneumonectomy was associated with a
higher risk of treatment-related mortality (P 5 .099).

CONCLUSIONS. With an acceptable mortality rate, a single-institutional series
demonstrated that trimodality therapy including pneumonectomy can be safely
accomplished in patients with advanced NSCLC. Cancer 2008;112:1106–13.

he treatment of locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) depends on the stage of the cancer, the cardiorespiratory
state of the patient, and locally available expertise. Many of the paradigms that have been developed in the modern era usually require a
combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy (RT), and surgical resection. The challenge in treatment of locally aggressive NSCLC is in the
delivery of a locally aggressive therapy to eliminate large volumes of
disease within the chest, while simultaneously addressing the risk of
distant metastasis. In addition, we must ensure that the toxicity of the
therapy does not outweigh the benefits of the treatment. In 1995,
Albain et al.1 published a phase 2 trial that attempted to address the
optimal treatment for a locally advanced NSCLC. The Southwest

Pneumonectomy After Chemoradiation in NSCLC/Allen et al.

Oncology Group (SWOG) investigators utilized a preoperative regimen of concurrent chemotherapy and RT
followed by surgical resection. The published results
were encouraging, with a 3-year survival rate of 25%.
In addition, the overall treatment-related mortality
was acceptable at 10%, with pneumonectomy patients
having a higher mortality rate (15%), which is consistent with the known increased mortality observed in
patients undergoing pneumonectomy compared with
lesser resections.2,3
The results of this trial prompted a North American Intergroup trial evaluating chemoradiation followed by surgery versus chemoradiotherapy alone for
patients with stage III NSCLC. This latter trial demonstrated a statically significant reduction in local failure
(22% vs 10%; P 5 .002) and improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) (22.4% vs 11.1%; P 5 .017) in
patients receiving the trimodality approach without a
difference in overall survival.4 The lack of survival
benefit was attributed to higher treatment-related
mortality in the surgical group, specifically, a 26%
mortality rate among the 54 patients who underwent
pneumonectomy after induction chemoradiotherapy.
These data led many oncologists and surgeons to conclude that pneumonectomy after chemoradiation
should be abandoned as a treatment strategy because
of the high mortality rate.
We were surprised by the high mortality reported
in the Intergroup study. In our long-term experience
with extrapleural pneumonectomy for mesothelioma,
we have reported mortality in the range of 2% to 4%.5
The importance of a high-volume tertiary care center
in the performance of complex surgical procedures
with lower morbidity and mortality has become recognized in many fields.6 We therefore sought to determine whether the results from the Intergroup trial
were consistent with the experience at our center.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The records of patients who underwent pneumonectomy at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH)
between 1995 and 2005 were reviewed to identify all
patients who had received neoadjuvant therapy that
included RT before surgery. Clinical parameters and
outcome data were obtained. Seventy-three consecutive patients who underwent preoperative therapy
followed by pneumonectomy were identified for this
study. Patients were staged using TNM staging
according to the 5th edition of the American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC).

Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Patients were chosen for this analysis if they received
definitive RT (defined as >4 weeks) followed by

1107

pneumonectomy at BWH. Patients with previous
lung resections, prior RT, recurrent cancer, or other
uncontrolled malignancies were excluded. All
patients had stage III NSCLC with 2 exceptions. A
limited number of patients (n 5 4) had stage IV
NSCLC with solitary resected brain metastasis. In
addition, 6 patients with tumors adjacent or potentially invading the mediastinum that were believed to
require preoperative therapy to render their disease
resectable and found at the time of surgery to have
T3N0, stage II NSCLC were also included.

Radiotherapy
RT was performed at many institutions with a wide
variety of techniques. A majority of patients underwent computed tomography (CT) simulation with
3-dimensional conformal treatment planning. In
general, the field arrangement was anteroposterior/
posteroanterior fields followed by an off-cord oblique
cone-down after 46 gray (Gy) with the final cone
down to 54 Gy. Beam energies varied from 6 to 15
megavolts. The majority of patients had elective
lymph node regions included in the primary treatment fields; these fields did not include the supraclavicular fossa, unless macroscopically involved. The
dose was calculated without heterogeneity corrections in all but the most recent patients.
Follow-up and Statistical Analysis
Overall survival was measured from the time of surgery to the date of death and was estimated by the
method of Kaplan and Meier. Patients who had not
died were censored at their date of last follow-up.
The log-rank test was used to compare overall survival between patient groups. A Fisher exact test was
used to determine the association of patient and
treatment characteristics with treatment-related mortality. Factors that were found to be significant at the
P 5 .200 level in the univariate analysis of each outcome were analyzed jointly as independent variables
in a multivariate model. The relative risk of death
associated with a patient group was based on the
hazards ratio (HR) estimated by the proportional
hazards model in the multivariate analysis. All P
values were based on 2-sided hypothesis tests. Computations were performed using SAS 9.1 software
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
From 1995 to 2005, 73 patients underwent pneumonectomy at BWH after preoperative therapy. The median age of the patients was 62 years (range, 37–78
years), and 43 patients were male (59%). Thirty-seven

patients (51%) (37 of 73) had stage IIIA NSCLC and
27 (37%) had stage IIIB NSCLC. Six patients (8%) had
stage IIB disease and 4 patients had stage IV because
of a solitary resected brain metastasis (Table 1).
Forty-one percent of patients had pretreatment
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) >60%
of predicted.
All patients received preoperative RT. The median dose was 54 Gy (range, 40–66 Gy). Sixty-nine
patients (95%) received preoperative chemotherapy
as well. The median number of cycles of chemotherapy was 3 (range, 1–8). The majority of the patients
received the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel (44; 60%) whereas 15 patients (21%) received
the combination of cisplatin and etoposide. The median time from the completion of RT to surgery was
6 weeks (range, 2–12 weeks). Forty-five patients
(62%) underwent left-sided pneumonectomy and 28
(38%) patients underwent a right pneumonectomy.
Complex pneumonectomy, defined as intrapericardial pneumonectomy or extended pneumonectomy,
was performed in 28 patients (38%), whereas 45
patients (62%) underwent standard pneumonectomy.
The treatment details are summarized in Table 1.

FIGURE 1. Overall survival of 73 patients treated with induction therapy
followed by pneumonectomy. Survival was measured from the time of surgery to the date of death and was estimated by the method of Kaplan and
Meier.

The median follow-up of all 25 living patients was
28 months (range, 6–108 months). The overall median
survival was 23 months (95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 17–30 months). The 1-year and 2-year survival
rates were 70% and 49%, respectively (Fig. 1). Univariate analysis for survival revealed that none of the clinical variables analyzed reached statistical significance,
although there was a trend toward improved survival
for patients who received RT doses >50 Gy (P 5 .079).
This trend was also noted on multivariate analysis
(P 5 .076; HR of 1.8) (Table 2) (Fig. 2).
Four patients died within the first 30 days after
surgery, for a 30-day mortality rate of 6%. One
patient died of a combination of pneumonia and cardiac failure. Three additional patients died of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Furthermore, 3
other patients died after 30 days but within 100 days
after surgery for an overall treatment-related mortality rate of 10%. One patient developed a fatal pulmonary embolism, 1 patient had ARDS, and 1 patient
died from pneumonia after complications of a bronchopleural fistula. On univariate analysis, only a
right-sided pneumonectomy was found to be a borderline significant predictor of treatment-related
mortality (P 5 .099). In particular, neither complex
pneumonectomies, RT dose, histology, nor type of
chemotherapy were found to be correlated with
treatment-related mortality (Table 3). Aside from the
7 patients who died from treatment-related mortality,
an additional 8 patients (11%) had complications

The appropriate management of stage III NSCLC
continues to be debated. Surgery as a frontline treatment has largely been abandoned for 2 major reasons: inadequate local control and insufficient
treatment of systemic disease. It has been previously
reported that when surgery is used as an upfront
treatment modality in patients with stage IIIA
NSCLC, up to 30% of patients will have incomplete
resection leaving behind macroscopic disease.7 The
5-year survival rate for patients with incomplete
resections is < 5%.7–10 However, even in patients
who can undergo complete resections, the risk of
systemic disease is significant and the overall

survival without adjuvant therapy at 5 years is only
10%.8 Furthermore, it is very difficult to administer
adjuvant therapy after major surgery, with patient
compliance limiting completion of adjuvant therapy.11 For these reasons, many clinicians prefer
neoadjuvant therapy.
Another option for treating locally advanced
NSCLC is definitive chemoradiotherapy. Randomized
trials have shown an improvement in survival of concurrent chemoradiotherapy over sequential therapy.12–14 Although sequential therapy leads to a
median survival of 14 months and a 3-year survival
rate of 15% to 20%, these trials have shown that concurrent chemoradiation leads to a 17-month median
survival and 25% to 30% 3-year survival rate. Further
improvements in outcome have been observed with
the addition of consolidation chemotherapy, with the
best results demonstrating a 26-month median survival and 3-year survival rate of 37%.4 However,
when one examines the patterns of failure throughout these studies, an interesting trend emerges. From
the initial sequential studies through the recently
published SWOG 9504 described above, the limitation continues to be the locoregional failure rate,

which has remained consistent between 47% and
53% and has not altered survival.4,12,14,15 This observation suggests that, although systemic therapy
advances can lead to improvements in survival via
reduction in distant metastasis, further survival gains
may be achieved through enhanced local control.
The addition of surgical resection to chemoradiation
is a potential option for improving local control.
One of the first major studies to address the
addition of surgery to chemoradiation, often called
trimodality therapy, for locally advanced NSCLC was
SWOG 8805. Patients enrolled in this phase 2 study
for stage III NSCLC received 45 Gy and concurrent
cisplatin and etoposide followed by surgical resection. This therapy was found to be tolerable, with a
10% treatment-related mortality, and led to an
encouraging median survival of 13 months for
patients with stage IIIB disease and 17 months for
those with stage IIIA disease. The overall 3-year survival rate was 26%.1 On the surface, these numbers
appear to be very comparable to those achieved with
chemoradiotherapy without surgery, as presented
above. However, local failure in the patients who had
surgery was only 10% and the combined local failure
rate (local 1 local and distant) decreased to 38%, an
improvement compared with the studies of chemoradiation alone. In addition to these promising results,
an intergroup trial testing chemoradiation followed
by surgery for pancoast tumors (all N0 or N1) was
completed that demonstrated a 55% 2-year survival
rate with only 2.7% treatment-related mortality.16 On
the basis of these encouraging results, a North American Intergroup study was mounted to compare chemoradiotherapy with trimodality therapy in patients
with stage III, N2-positive NSCLC.
From 1994 to 2001, 429 patients were enrolled in
a phase 3 randomized trial comparing chemoradiotherapy with 61 Gy versus 45 Gy of RT combined
with chemotherapy followed by surgical resection.
The median survival for both treatment arms was
23.6 months for the trimodality arm and 22.2 months
for the chemoradiation arm (P not significant). However, the PFS and local failure rate was statistically
better for the surgical arm compared with chemoradiation alone (median PFS of 12.5 months vs 10.5
months [P 5 .01]; local failure only 10% vs 22%
[P 5 .02]).4 The overall survival of the surgical arm
was limited by early treatment-induced mortality.
Sixteen patients (7.9%) had treatment-related mortality in the surgical group compared with 4 patients in
the chemoradiotherapy arm (2.1%). This was particularly striking in the subgroup of patients who underwent pneumonectomy. Fourteen of 54 patients (26%
of the pneumonectomy subgroup) had treatment-

related mortality after pneumonectomy. Nearly all of
these (11 of 14 patients; 79%) were because of respiratory causes or ARDS. These results led many clinicians to conclude that pneumonectomy after
induction chemoradiation therapy should be abandoned or severely limited. The high mortality rate in
the Intergroup trial prompted a subsequent trial
comparing trimodality therapy, as was done in Intergroup 0139, to induction chemotherapy alone (ie,
without RT) followed by surgery in an attempt to
reduce the toxicity of chemoradiation.
In our retrospective review, we sought to determine whether the results from the Intergroup study
were consistent with our own experience. As we have
shown, the overall treatment-related mortality rate
from our series was 6% at 30 days (standard benchmark of operative mortality) and 10% at 100 days.
This mortality is 2.5–fold to 4-fold lower than the
26% mortality reported from the Intergroup trial and
consistent or slightly higher than other reports of
pneumonectomy alone or chemotherapy followed by
pneumonectomy (Table 4).2,3,17,18 The results from
this study of a 6% 30-day mortality rate are comparable to our own published data showing a 30-day
mortality rate of 4% after pneumonectomy without
induction therapy.19 In addition, only 4 patients in
the current series developed fatal pulmonary complications compared with the 11 patients who died as a
result of ARDS (21%) in the Intergroup study. This is
significant because one would expect that if RT
increased toxicity from surgical resection it would be
because of decreased pulmonary reserve. We did find
that right pneumonectomy was a higher risk procedure than left pneumonectomy, as previously
reported.
An obvious caveat to the results we have presented is the inherent selection bias in our retrospec-

tive series. Although we included all patients who
underwent preoperative RT with or without chemotherapy followed by pneumonectomy over a 10-year
time period, we have not reported on those patients
who either developed progressive disease during
induction therapy or those who developed toxicity
during induction therapy and therefore did not go on
to receive surgical therapy. In addition, those patients
treated with preoperative chemotherapy (without RT)
followed by surgery are herein excluded. However,
patients with progressive disease and toxicity were
also excluded from the surgical arm of the Intergroup trial and other efforts to investigate trimodality
therapy.
It has been well documented for many complex
surgical procedures including pancreaticoduodenectomy, esophagectomy, and liver resection that the volume of both the surgeon and the hospital has a
significant impact on mortality.6 However, there has
been some controversy regarding whether the same
data exist for pneumonectomy. In the study by Begg
et al.6 no difference was observed in mortality based
on hospital volume for pneumonectomies. However,
other reports have identified both the hospital volume as well as the specialization of the surgeon in
only noncardiac thoracic surgery as important prognostic factors,20–22 as well as the existence of specialized teams and postoperative monitoring and
treatment units.23 Our institution and its support
staff have specific expertise in pneumonectomies
because of our high volume of extrapleural pneumonectomies for mesothelioma (90 performed in 2006)
and have published improvements in the surgical
techniques of these patients.5,24,25 Whether this experience in mesothelioma translates to an improved
outcome in the management of pneumonectomy
patients after chemoradiation in NSCLC is unknown.

To our knowledge, the current study is the largest
series reported to date of patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy followed by pneumonectomy. However, other smaller series from selected institutions
have also demonstrated an acceptable mortality of
pneumonectomy after chemoradiotherapy. The University of Maryland group reported a series of
patients who received high-dose RT (>59 Gy) with
concurrent chemotherapy followed by surgery. They
reported no postoperative deaths in the 11 patients
who underwent pneumonectomy.26 Another reported
small series from the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center
of patients receiving chemoradiotherapy before surgery noted a major pulmonary event in 18% of
patients with no mortality.27 Finally, Choi et al.28
reported a series of 30 of patients treated with 60 Gy
of radiation and concurrent chemotherapy followed
by pneumonectomy at the New England Medical
Center and Boston Medical Center with a 13% mortality. The above reports are all single-institution,
nonprospective series with surgery performed by
dedicated thoracic surgeons. However, it is very likely
that there is an inherent selection bias that is present
in all of these series, including our own.
Another interesting note that arose from the
results of the current study was a suggestion of
improved survival with higher doses of preoperative
RT. In the Intergroup study, a subgroup analysis indicated that, in patients in the trimodality arm, those
patients who achieved lymph node downstaging to
pT0 had a remarkable 5-year survival rate of 41%.4
Similar findings by our own group as well as others
have indicated that lymph node downstaging after
induction chemoradiation is the most significant predictor of overall survival.29 In the current study, not
all patients had N2-positive lymph nodes documented at the time of diagnosis, such that a lymph node
downstaging rate could not be accurately assessed.
However, the hypothesis that intensified induction
chemoradiation is safe and may improve lymph
node downstaging before surgery is an intriguing
concept that should invite further study.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the results of the current single-institution experience with a dedicated thoracic surgical
team and systematized approach to patient care
have shown that preoperative chemoradiotherapy
followed by pneumonectomy results in an acceptable
mortality rate in a larger cohort than that of the
Intergroup study. Trimodality therapy, including
pneumonectomy, should remain an option for the
treatment of patients with stage III NSCLC. We also
suggest that this approach should be reserved for

specialized high-volume centers of general thoracic
surgery in clinical practice and in future trials.
