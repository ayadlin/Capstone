Abstract
MICA/B (the major histocompatibility antigen-related chain A and B) and Rae I
are stress-inducible ligands for the immune-receptor NKG2D. Mechanisms by which
genotoxic stress and DNA damage induce the expression of NKG2D ligands remain
incompletely understood. Here, we report that inhibition of xanthine oxidoreductase
(XOR) activity by allopurinol or inhibition of XOR expression by gene knockdown
abrogated genotoxic stress-induced expression of MICA/B and Rae I in three tumor
cell lines. XOR knockdown also blocked gemcitabine-mediated antitumor activity in
an orthotopic syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer. As a rate-limiting enzyme in
the purine catabolic pathway, XOR generates two end-products, uric acid and reactive
oxygen species (ROS). ROS scavenging had an insignificant effect on genotoxic
drug-induced MICA/B expression but modestly inhibited radiation-induced MICA/B
expression. Exogenous uric acid (in the form of monosodium urate) induced MICA/B
expression by activating the MAP kinase pathway. Allopurinol blocked genotoxic
stress-induced MAP kinase activation. Our study provides mechanistic insights into
genotoxic stress-induced activation of the MAP kinase pathway and suggests that XOR
is required for genotoxic stress-induced NKG2D ligand expression and gemcitabinemediated antitumor activity.

Introduction

MAP kinase pathway by oncogene mutations such as RAS
or BRAF induces MICA/B expression in thyroid tumor
cell lines [12]. Ras activation induces the expression of
murine NKG2D ligand expression [14]. DNA damage
by exposure to radiation and genotoxic drugs induces
NKG2D ligand expression in tumor and fibroblast cells
[13, 15, 16]. Mechanistic studies suggest that ROS plays
a critical role in DNA damage-induced NKG2D ligand
expression in part through E2F transcriptionl regulation
[17–20]. Alternatively, presence of DNA in the cytoplasm
and activation of STING in DNA-damaged cells leads to
the activation of IRF-3 transcription factor and induction
of NKG2D ligand expression [21, 22].
Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is a rate-limiting
enzyme in the purine catabolic pathway [23]. Uric acid,
one of its end products, has been identified as a novel

The ligands for the NKG2D immunoreceptor
include one group of retinoic acid early transcript-1
(Rae-1), H60, and Mult1 in rodents, four UL-16 binding
proteins and the MHC class I-related chain A and B
(MICA/B) in humans. These ligands bind the NKG2D
receptor expressed on natural killer cells, γδ T cells, and
CD8+ T cells, and play an important role in activating
innate immunity [1, 2]. MICA/B proteins are not
expressed in normal epithelial cells except at low levels
in variable areas of the intestinal epithelium of healthy
individuals [3–5]. MICA/B expression is increased in
melanoma, breast, colon, hepatocellular, and prostate
cancers and some leukemias [4, 6–8], due in part to
oncogene mutations [9–13]. For example, activation of the

fluorescence level in untreated cells (black line) as a
control. The shift of the histogram curve indicates the
increase of ROS levels in cells treated with genotoxic
drugs and radiation. Allopurinol had litter effect on
inhibiting ROS production at 4 hr but completely inhibited
ROS production (green line) at 12 hr after HT29 cells
were exposed to 5-FU, gemcitabine, or radiation. Similar
observations were made with HeLa cells (data not shown).

“danger signal” that activates innate immunity [24–26].
Uric acid produced in apoptotic or necrotic cells induces
the expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80
and CD86 in dendritic cells and promote dendritic
cell maturation [24–26]. Recent studies demonstrated
that XOR expression is decreased in several types of
malignancy, including breast, colon, gastric, lung cancers
[27–31]. How XOR expression contributes to an
aggressive tumor behavior and a shorter survival remains
unclear [28]. XOR is not only a differentiation marker but
also plays an important role in promoting the inflammatory
state [32]. Gibbings et al. [33] reported that XOR
expression is increased in the inflammatory mononuclear
phagocytes and plays an important role in CINC1 (Cytokine-Induced Neutrophil Chemoattractant-1)
secretion and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes
into the M2 phenotype of macrophages. Here we report
that XOR plays a crucial role in activating the MAP
kinase pathway and inducing NKG2D ligand expression
in tumor cells undergoing genotoxic stress, and that XOR
is required for gemcitabine-mediated antitumor activity in
a syngeneic mouse breast cancer model.

XOR is required for genotoxic stress-induced
MICA/B expression
Genotoxic stress or DNA damage leads to increased
NKG2D ligand expression [13, 36–39]. Consistent with
these observations, we found that the levels of MICA
and MICB transcripts were increased in HeLa and HT29
cells exposed to 5-FU (10 μM), gemcitabine (2 μM), and
radiation (40 Gy) (Figure 3A). Allopuinol alone had no
effect on MICA and MICB mRNA expression but blocked
genotoxic stress-induced MICA and MICB mRNA
expression (Figure 3B).
We next conducted FACS analysis to examine
MICA/B expression. As shown in Figure 3C, untreated
control HeLa and HT29 cells (marked as None) expressed
modest levels of MICA/B (green line). Antibody isotype
control was shown in a black line in all histograms.
5-FU, gemcitabine (GEM), or radiation (IR) significantly
increased MICA/B expression, as shown by the green
line representing MICA/B-positive cells that significantly
shifted to right side, compared to untreated control.
Allopurinol had no effect on basal level MICA/B
expression but blocked MICA/B expression in the cells
exposed to 5-FU, gemcitabine, or radiation (red line)
(Figure 3C).
RCAS-Neu cells, a murine breast cancer cell
line, did not express Rae I (labeled as a green line)
(comparing with isotype control, labeled as a black
line) (Figure 3D) (left upper histogram). Consistently,
5-FU (10 μM) and gemcitabine (2 μM) increased Rae I
expression (Figure 3D, left middle and bottom histograms
respectively). AP blocked 5-FU- and gemcitabine-induced
Rae I expression in RCAS-Neu cells (Figure 3D).
To verify the role of XOR in mediating genotoxic
stress-induced MICA/B expression in tumor cells, we
tested if XOR suppression also blocked genotoxic
stress-induced MICA/B expression. XOR expression
was readily detectable by immunofluorescene
staining in control-miRNA- but not in XOR- miRNAtransfected HeLa cells (Figure 4A). Suppression
of XOR expression was confirmed by Western blot
(Figure 4B, inset). Uric acid production (Figure 4B)
and MICA/B expression (Figure 4C) were increased
in control-miRNA- but not XOR-miRNA-transfected
HeLa cells treated with 5- FU, gemcitabine, and

Results
Genotoxic stress leads to increased uric acid and
ROS production
Uric acid is a novel “danger” signal that is capable
of alerting the immune system [34]. XOR, a ratelimiting enzyme that catalyzes xanthine to produce uric
acid and ROS, is differentially expressed in a variety
of malignancies [27–30]. We first confirmed XOR
expression in the cytoplasm of HeLa and HT29 cells
by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 1A). Western
blot analysis revealed the expression of XOR as an
approximately 150-kDa protein. Genotoxic stress did not
significantly alter the levels of XOR expression in HT29
and HeLa cells (Figure 1B). Furthermore, XOR levels did
not change over different times in genotoxic drug-treated
HT29 (Figure 1D) and HeLa cells (Figure 1C).
Uric acid accumulates in tumor tissue following
genotoxic drug treatment [35]. Here we tested if uric acid
accumulated in HeLa and HT29 cells after genotoxic
stress, including 5-FU, gemcitabine or radiation. As shown
in Figure 2A, intracellular uric acid levels were elevated
at least by 50% in two tumor cell lines after exposure.
Allopurinol, an analog of hypoxanthine and a specific
XOR inhibitor, completely blocked the accumulation of
uric acid in the cells treated with 5-FU, gemcitabine, or
radiation. Similar observation was made with RCAS-Neu,
a murine breast cancer cell line (Figure 2B). Intracellular
ROS levels were slightly elevated in HT29 cells when
analyzed at 4 hr (Figure 2C) and significantly elevated
12 hr (Figure 2D) after exposure to 5-FU, gemcitabine,

radiation (Figure 4B). Similar results were observed
with HT29 cells transfected with control-miRNA
and XOR-miRNA (data not shown). Knockdown of
XOR in RCAS-Neu cells, as revealed by Western blot
(Figure 4D), also led to the suppression of genotoxic
stress-induced Rae I expression (Figure 4E).

completely scavenge ROS in HT29 cells exposed to 5-FU,
gemcitabine or radiation (data not shown).

Uric acid induces NKG2D ligand expression
We next tested whether exogenous uric acid was
able to induce MICA/B expression. Due to its acidity
and poor solubility [40], uric acid was used in its sodium
form, monosodium urate (MSU). MICA/B expression
was induced in HeLa and HT29 cells (Figure 6A, upper
panel) exposed to MSU (blue line) for 16 hr, compared to
untreated control (red line). Isotype control is shown in a
green line). MSU did not induce MHC class I expression
in either cell line (Figure 6A, bottom panel). HT29 cells
treated with MSU (250 µg/ml) expressed more MICA/B
at 12 hr than at 24 and 48 hr (Figure 6B, bottom panels).

Role of ROS in regulating MICA/B expression
We next tested whether induction of MICA/B
expression in tumor cells under genotoxic stress was
due to ROS production. N-acytelcysteine (NAC), an
ROS scavenger, did not inhibit the induction of MICA/B
expression in HT29 cells exposed to 5-FU or gemcitabine,
but partially inhibited radiation-induced MICA/B
expression in HT29 cells (Figure 5). NAC was able to

expression by IF staining with an anti-XOR antibody. (c) The specificity of the antibody on HeLa cells was confirmed by pre-mixing antiXOR antibody (1:50 in 200 μl) with purified XOR (2 μg/200 μl). Normal rabbit IgG was included as a negative control (d). (B–D) Genotoxic
stress does not alter XOR expression. HeLa and HT29 cells were left untreated or treated with 5-FU (10 μM), gemcitabine (2  μM) or
radiation (40 Gy) for 24 hr (B) or treated with 5-FU (10 μM) or gemcitabine (2 μM) in HeLa (C) and HT29 cells (D) for the indicated time.
Cell lysates were prepared in NP-40 lysis buffer and analyzed for XOR expression by Western blot with a rabbit anti-XOR antiserum.

alone. SP600125 (20 μM), an inhibitor of JNK, did not
inhibit MICA/B expression in MSU- stimulated HT29 and
HeLa cells.

Constitutive MAPK activation due to oncogene
mutations such as RAS and BRAF plays an important
role in inducing MICA/B expression [12, 14, 41]. MSU
dramatically induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HeLa
and HT29 cells peaked at 30–60 min after MSU addition
(Figure 7A, left panel) and in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 7A, right panel). PD98059 (50 μM) and U0126
(2 μM) inhibited the expression of MSU-induced MICA/B
expression in HT29 and HeLa cells (Figure 7B). The
inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, SB202180 (2 μM), also
inhibited MSU-induced MICA/B expression, though
p38 activation was not detected in these two cell lines
(data not shown), probably due to the low sensitivity of
the antibody against p38. PD98059 plus SB202180 did
not block MICA/B expression more than either inhibitor

Intracellular uric acid concentrations in MSUtreated cells
To determine if exogenous MSU used in our study
was physiologically relevant, we tested if MSU was
taken into the cytoplasm and reached the concentrations
equivalent to that in the cells exposed to genotoxic
stress. As shown in Figure 8A, intracellular uric acid
concentrations reached up to 20 μg/5 × 106 cells at 4 hr
after MSU addition (250 μg/ml). Intracellular uric acid
levels were increased in HT29 and HeLa cells but only
slightly increased in A375 cells. Interestingly, MSU only
slightly induced MICA/B expression (Figure 8B) and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 8C) in A375 cells.

Statistical analysis revealed that there was no significant
difference (p = 0.056) in tumor growth rate between
Ctr-miRNA and XOR-miRNA-transfected tumors
(Figure  11A). Gemcitabine treatment significantly
inhibited the growth of Ctr-miRNA-transfected RCASNeu tumors, compared to saline treated group (p = 0.011).
Surprisingly, gemcitabine treatment had no effect on
the growth of XOR-miRNA-transfected RCAS-Neu
tumors (Figure 11A). Gemcitabine treatment significantly
decreased the weight of Ctr-miRNA-transfected RCASNeu tumors but had no effect on the weight of XORmiRNA-transfected RCAS-Neu tumors (Figure 11B),
compared to their untreated counterparts. This experiment
was repeated twice with almost identical results.

Uric acid accumulation is required for genotoxic
stress-induced MAP kinase activation
We next tested whether inhibition of XOR
activity by allopurinol led to the inhibition of ERK1/2
phosphorylation in tumor cells undergoing genotoxic
stress. As shown in Figure 10A, ERK phosphorylation
was induced in HeLa and HT29 cells when analyzed at
24 hr after exposure to 5-FU, gemcitabine, and radiation.
Allopurinol completely blocked the induction of ERK1/2
phosphorylation in these cells (Figure 10A). We next
tested if ROS had a role in genotoxic stress-induced
MAPK activation. As shown in Figure 10B, NAC
failed to suppress ERK phosphorylation in 5-FU- and
gemcitabine-treated HT29 cells but partially inhibited the
activation of EKR phosphorylation in HT29 cells exposed
to radiation. Moreover, H2O2 (100 μM) weakly induced
ERK phosphorylation in HT29 cells (Figure 10B).

Discussion
Our study provides several lines of evidence
showing that uric acid production was responsible for the
genotoxic stress-induced NKG2/D ligand expression: 1)
Inhibition of XOR activity by allopurinol or XOR
expression by XOR miRNA abrogated the genotoxic
stress-induced NKG2D ligand expression, MAP kinase
activation, and uric acid production; 2) Exogenous uric
acid induced MICA/B expression; 3) Intracellular uric
acid concentrations in MSU-treated cells were comparable
to that in the cells exposed to genotoxic stress; 4) A375
cells that failed to uptake uric acid did not respond to
MSU to induce MICA/B expression and to activate the
MAP pathway. Of note, induction of MICA/B expression

in HT29 cells undergoing genotoxic stress lagged behind
uric acid accumulation. It makes sense since increased
MICA/B expression was likely due to the transcriptional
regulation mediated by AP-1 through the MAP kinase
activation.
Mechanistic study revealed that genotoxic stress
induced MICA/B expression by uric acid-mediated MAP
kinase activation. Several lines of evidence support this
supposition: 1) Exogenous MSU rapidly activated the
MAP kinase pathway (Figure 7A); The inhibition of the
MAP kinase pathway blocked MSU-induced MICA/B
expression; 2) Inhibition of uric acid production by
allopurinol in tumor cells undergoing genotoxic stress
inhibited MAP kinase activation (Figure 10) and MICA/B

expression (Figure 3); 3) We and others showed that RAS
and BRAF oncogene mutation and activation leads to
increased MICA/B expression [12, 14]; 4) The promoters
of both the MICA and MICB genes contain a putative
AP-1 site [18]. AP-1 is involved in regulating mouse
NKG2D ligand gene expression [42]. It should be noted
that MSU also activates other signaling molecules such
as the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, p38 MAP kinase
pathway, and NF-κB [43]. NF-κB induces MICA/B
expression in activated T cells [44–46]. The signaling
molecules and the transcription factors other than the
MAP kinase pathway-activated AP-1, such as NF-κB,
may also contribute to MSU-induced MICA/B gene
expression.

While our data collectively suggest that uric acid
produced by XOR plays a critical role in mediating
genotoxic stress-induced NKG2D ligand expression,
several questions remain to be answered: 1) it is not clear
if MSU enters cells through endocytosis by binding the
cell membrane lipids in a receptor-independent manner
[47] or through uric acid transporter such as GLUT9 or
URAT1 [48]; 2) The mechanisms by which increased

concentrations of intracellular uric acid activate the
MAP kinase pathway are not clear; 3) It is also not clear
if uric acid produced in DNA-damaged cells can form
precipitates to act like uric acid crystals.
Prior studies have shown that ROS induces
MICA/B expression by activating the promoters of
the MICA and MICB genes [17–20]. Another study
showed that ROS induces MICB and ULBP1 expression

in human airway epithelial cells, in part by increasing
the transcripts of MICB and ULBP1 and by increasing
the translocation of these NKG2D ligands to the
cell surface [49]. ROS production is a well observed
phenomenon in tumor cells exposed to genotoxic drugs
and radiation. We found that ROS scavenging did not
block the induction of MICA/B expression in cells
exposed to 5-FU or gemcitabine but partially blocked the
induction of MICA/B expression in these cells exposed
to radiation at 16 hr (Figure 5). Exogenous hydrogen
peroxide had only a minor effect on MICA/B expression
(data not shown). These observations suggest that ROS
production plays a minor or redundant role in inducing
MICA/B expression in the tumor cell lines used in our
study. This is particularly true that in the early phase
of genotoxic stress, MICA/B expression was slightly
increased in the absence of uric acid production whereas
ROS levels were increased, which was independent of
XOR (Figure 9). ROS may play a critical role in inducing
NKG2D ligand expression in XOR-negative tumor cells
undergone genotoxic stress.

Patients with XOR-negative breast and lung cancers
are associated with a poor prognosis [28, 31]. Fini et al.
[50] reported that two of three XOR inhibitors, oxypurinol
and Y-700, but not allopurinol, modestly but significantly
promote the growth of MDA-231 breast cancer in a
xenograft mouse model. We found that XOR-miRNAtransfected RCAS-Neu tumors did not grow significantly
slower than Ctr-miRNA-transfected RCAS-Neu tumors
(Figure 11A). Interestingly, gemcitabine treatment
inhibited the growth of Ctr-miRNA-transfected but not
XOR-miRNA-transfected RCAS-Neu breast tumors
(Figure 11B). We speculate that gemcitabine-mediated
antitumor activity in this syngeneic breast cancer model is
mediated by the induction of antitumor immunity through
increased NKG2D ligand expression. In support of this
notion, ectopic expression of the murine NKG2D ligands
Rae1β or H60 in tumor cell lines results in potent rejection
of the tumor cells [51]; Inhibition of XOR activity by
allopurinol blocks tumor rejection in a syngeneic mouse
model [35]. Moreover, a recent study showed that the
shed form of MULT1, a high-affinity NKG2D ligand,

activates NK cells and causes tumor rejection in part by
competitively reversing a global desensitization of NK cells
imposed by engagement of membrane NKG2D ligands on
tumor-associated cells [52]. These observations collectively
suggest that increased NKG2D ligand expression following
genotoxic drugs or radiation and the subsequent antitumor
immunity may contribute to their therapeutic effects.

In summary, our study showed that genotoxic stressinduced NKG2D ligand expression in tumor cell lines
was largely mediated by increased intracellular uric acid
concentrations through XOR. Uric acid induced NKG2D
ligand expression by activating the MAP kinase pathway.
XOR plays an important role in gemcitabine-mediated
antitumor activity in a murine breast cancer model.

MICB gene. Oligonucleotides 5ʹ-TGAAGG- TCGGAGT
CAACG-GATTTGGTC- 3ʹ and 5ʹ- ATGGACTGTGGTC
ATGAGTCC TTCCACG- 3ʹ were used to amplify a
527-bp GAPDH DNA fragment. The PCR reaction was
set with an initial denaturation of 2 min at 94°C and
subsequent denaturation for 45 s at 94°C, annealing for
45 s at 55°C, and extension for 1 min at 72°C. Thirty
cycles were used to amplify the PCR product.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma
(St. Louis, MO). MSU crystals were prepared as
previously described [53]. Briefly, supersaturated uric
acid solutions (4–5 mg/ml) in 0.1 M borate (pH 8.5)
were left at room temperature for 72 h. The precipitate
of MSU crystals were spin down and followed by
washing with alcohol and acetone once. MSU crystals
were air-dried and reconstituted in saline. SB202180
and PD98059 were purchased from Calbiochem (San

RCAS-Neu cells are a murine breast cancer cell line that
is derived from a breast cancer induced in TVA transgenic
mice through intraductal injection of an avian retroviral
vector encoding a mutant rat Neu oncogene [55]. RCASNeu and HT29 cells were grown in complete RPMI 1640
medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa and
A375 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine
serum.

XOR knockdown
The XOR hairpin DNA oliognucleotides were
synthesized and cloned into a microRNA expression
vector, pcDNA6.2/GW-miR according to manufacturer’s
instruction (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The sequences
for oligonucleotides that target XOR mRNA were
5ʹ- TGCTGTGATGATGTTCCCTCCAACGGGTTTT
GGCCACTGACTGACCCGTTGGAGAACATCATCA- 3ʹ
and 5ʹ-CCTGTGATGATGTTCTCCAACGGGTCAGTCA
GTGGCCAAAACCCGTTGGGGGAACATCATCAC- 3ʹ.
The sequences of the inserted oligonucleotides were
verified by DNA sequencing. Two pairs of primers that
target murine XOR RNA at nucleotide position 1261 and
1395 were cloned into the same vector. XOR miRNA
targeting nucleotide position 1395 was used in whole
study. The same expression vector encoding a miRNA
sequence targeting β-galactosidase was included as a
negative control. HeLa and HT29 cells were transfected
with control or XOR miRNA and screened in the media
containing blasticidin (10 μg/ml). Pools of stable colonies
were analyzed for XOR expression by IF staining and
Western blot.

Immuofluorescence (IF) staining
XOR expression was detected by IF staining
with a rabbit anti-XOR rabbit antibody (Rockland
Immunologicals, Inc., Bertsville, PA) (1:100) and
examined under a fluorescence microscope. The pictures
were taken with a digital camera connected to Olympus
BX41TF fluorescence microscope.

Orthotopic breast cancer model
The study was carried out in strict accordance with
the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.
The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Rush University Medical
Center. Female FVB mice (6–7-wks-old; 6 mice/group)
were inoculated with Ctr-miRNA- or XOR-miRNAtransfected RCAS-Neu cells (5 × 105 cells in 50 μl/mouse)
by injection into the fat pad and treated with saline or
gemcitabine (160 mg/kg body weight) by intraperitoneal
injection on day 1, 7, 14 days. Tumor volumes were
determined by caliper measurement, twice a week, and
calculated based on the formula: length × width2 × π ÷ 6.
Mice were sacrificed on day 42. Tumors were collected
and weighed. The differences in tumor volumes were
statistically analyzed by using the one-way repeated
measure ANOVA. The differences in tumor weight were
analyzed by using an unpaired Student t test. The p value
of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
