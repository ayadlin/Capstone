Abstract
Epidemiologic studies have highlighted associations between the regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and reduced glioma risks in humans. Most NSAIDs function as COX-2 inhibitors that
prevent production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Because PGE2 induces expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (MDSC), we hypothesized that COX-2 blockade would suppress gliomagenesis by inhibiting MDSC
development and accumulation in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In mouse models of glioma, treatment
with the COX-2 inhibitors acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or celecoxib inhibited systemic PGE2 production and delayed
glioma development. ASA treatment also reduced the MDSC-attracting chemokine CCL2 (C-C motif ligand 2) in
the TME along with numbers of CD11bþLy6GhiLy6Clo granulocytic MDSCs in both the bone marrow and the
TME. In support of this evidence that COX-2 blockade blocked systemic development of MDSCs and their CCL2mediated accumulation in the TME, there were defects in these processes in glioma-bearing Cox2-deficient and
Ccl2-deficient mice. Conversely, these mice or ASA-treated wild-type mice displayed enhanced expression of
CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine 10) and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in the TME, consistent
with a relief of MDSC-mediated immunosuppression. Antibody-mediated depletion of MDSCs delayed glioma
growth in association with an increase in CXCL10 and CTLs in the TME, underscoring a critical role for MDSCs
in glioma development. Finally, Cxcl10-deficient mice exhibited reduced CTL infiltration of tumors, establishing
that CXCL10 limited this pathway of immunosuppression. Taken together, our findings show that the COX-2
pathway promotes gliomagenesis by directly supporting systemic development of MDSCs and their accumulation in the TME, where they limit CTL infiltration. Cancer Res; 71(7); 2664–74. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain
tumors and present with dismal patient prognosis. Despite the
need for curative treatments, definitive information about
their etiology is lacking and identification of factors that
influence the risk and prognosis remains undefined. Recent
reports in epidemiology have exposed yet unexplained roles of

immunosurveillance in gliomagenesis and survival of glioma
patients. For example, the regular use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) seems to be associated with
reduced occurrence of malignant gliomas in humans (1, 2).
NSAIDs mediate their biological effects, at least partially, by
suppression of COX-2 and its product prostaglandin E2
(PGE2), which, in turn, induces differentiation of immunoregulatory cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), in tumor-bearing hosts
(3–6).
MDSCs consist of 2 distinct populations, Ly6GhiLy6Clo
granulocytic MDSCs (gMDSC) and Ly6GLy6Chi monocytic
MDSCs (mMDSC), and expand under pathologic conditions
including tumors (7). They negatively regulate both adaptive
and innate immune responses by producing arginase-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; also known as NOS2), and
reactive oxygen species (7). Thus, MDSCs facilitate tumor
progression by dampening immunosurveillance and are considered to be an important target for tumor immunotherapy.
It is critical to gain a better understanding of the complex
biological interactions between the immune system (MDSCs
in particular) and developing gliomas.
In this regard, the chemokine CCL2 (C-C motif ligand 2) has
been shown to play an important role in migration of MDSCs

COX-2 Blockade and Gliomagenesis

toward the tumor microenvironment (TME; ref. 8). However, it
is unknown whether the COX-2 pathway affects chemokine
expression profiles that are responsible for MDSC accumulation in the TME.
In this study, we evaluated our hypothesis that COX-2
blockade by NSAIDs would suppress gliomagenesis by inhibiting development of MDSCs and their accumulation in the
TME, using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon–mediated
de novo murine glioma model (9, 10). Our findings in this study
implicate significance of the COX-2 pathway in gliomagenesis
through chemokine-mediated immune cell infiltration in the
TME. Our data also suggest that NSAID-based prophylactic
treatment strategies may provide therapeutic benefit for
individuals at heightened risk of glioma development, assuming predictive risk factors can be identified.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Taconic
Farms. C57BL/6 background mice deficient for the following
genes were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory: Cox-2,
Ccl2, and Cxcl10 (C-X-C motif chemokine 10). Animals were
bred and handled in the Animal Facility at the University of
Pittsburgh per an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee–approved protocol. As the Cox-2–deficient breeders
were heterozygous, PCR using tail DNA was employed to
genotype the mice per the vendor's instruction.
Intracerebroventricular DNA injection used for glioma
induction
The procedure has been described previously (9). In vivo
compatible DNA transfection reagent (In vivo-JetPEI) was
obtained from Polyplus Transfection. The following DNA
plasmids were used for glioma induction: pT2/C-Luc//PGKSB13 (0.2 mg), pT/CAGGS-NRASV12 (0.4 mg), and pT2/shP53
(0.4 mg).
Glioma cell culture
The procedure to establish glioma cell lines from SB transposon–mediated de novo murine gliomas has been described
previously (10). The cultured cells were treated with the
following NSAIDs at the indicated concentrations: acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; Sigma Aldrich), celecoxib (BioVision), or
dimethylcelecoxib (kindly provided by Dr. Axel H. Sch€
onthal,
University of Southern California). Cell proliferation assay
using WST-1 (Roche) was conducted on the indicated days
per the manufacturer's instruction. The indicated groups were
used as a control to determine the relative cell viability.
PGE2 release assay
The PGE2 ELISA kit was obtained from R&D Systems.
Assays were conducted per the manufacturer's instructions.
In vivo NSAID treatment
We treated mice with ASA (10 mg/kg/d) or celecoxib (30
mg/kg/d), based on previous studies (11–14) and the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration guidance (15). To treat neonates and

www.aacrjournals.org

unweaned mice with ASA, we prepared water-based solutions
of 2 mg/mL ASA, and mice received the following volume of
these solutions by oral gavage: 20 mL for the first week, 50 mL
for the second week, and 100 mL for the third week after birth.
When the mice were weaned on days 21 to 23 after birth, they
started to receive the treatment via the following method:
drinking water that contained 0.05 mg/mL ASA or diet that
contained 150 ppm celecoxib.
Quantitative real-time PCR
The procedure has been described previously (16). The following primers and probes were obtained from Applied Biosystems:
Ccl2 (Mm00441242_m1), Cxcl10 (Mm99999072_m1), and Nos2
(Mm01290688_m1).
Isolation of brain-infiltrating leukocytes
The procedure to isolate brain-infiltrating leukocytes (BIL)
has been described previously (17, 18). Because of a few BILs
available from each individual, BILs were pooled from 3 mice
in a given group for further evaluation. Fluorescent dye–
conjugated antibodies for flow cytometry were obtained as
follows: anti-CD4 (VH129.19), anti-CD8 (53-6.7), and anti-Ly6C
(AL-21) from BD Biosciences; anti-CD11b (M1/70), antiCD107a (1D4B), anti-FoxP3 (NRRF-30), and anti–Gr-1 (RB68C5) from eBioScience; anti-Ly6G (1A8) from BioLegend; and
anti–COX-2 (SP21) from Abcam. Flow cytometric data were
obtained using a Coulter EPICS cytometer (Beckman Coulter)
and analyzed using WinList software (version 6.0; Verity
Software House).
Antibody-mediated Gr-1þ cell depletion assay
The procedure has been described previously (10). Anti–Gr1 (RB6-8C5) monoclonal antibody (mAb) was obtained from
eBioScience; control IgG was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Mice with developing gliomas received intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injections of these Abs (0.25 mg/dose) on days 21, 23, 25, and
27 after plasmid DNA transfection.
Statistical analyses
Student's t test was carried out to analyze differences
between 2 groups; one-way ANOVA with Holm's post hoc test
was done for multiple groups. Log-rank test was done to
analyze survival of mice with developing gliomas. All data
were analyzed using R Environment (version 2.12.1). Value of
P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Results
Developing gliomas express COX-2
To address the effects of NSAID treatment on gliomagenesis, we first induced de novo gliomas in mice by intracerebroventricular transfection of NRas and small hairpin RNA
against P53, using the SB transposon system (9, 10). By day 21
postinjection, the induced tumors showed pathologic characteristics of World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2
diffuse fibrillary astrocytoma seen in humans and progressed
to WHO grade 3 anaplastic astrocytoma by day 60 (Supplementary Fig. S1). These findings suggest that these tumors

initially develop as low-grade gliomas (LGG) and progress to
high-grade gliomas (HGG), as often seen in the progression of
human gliomas.
Subsequently, we evaluated COX-2 expressions in these
mice (Supplementary Fig. S2). Glioma tissues, especially
late-stage tumors (i.e., day 60), expressed COX-2 at high levels,
whereas adjacent normal brain tissues did not show detectable levels of COX-2 expression (Supplementary Fig. S2A, left).
Moreover, CD11bþ cells in the spleen and bone marrow
consistently express COX-2 in the presence or absence of
intracranial gliomas (Supplementary Fig. S2A, middle and
right; Supplementary Fig. S2B). These data suggest that the

de novo gliomas express COX-2 whereas the tumors do not
seem to enhance the baseline expression levels of COX-2 in the
spleen or bone marrow.
NSAID treatment inhibits glioma development in vivo
We then established primary glioma cell lines from these
COX-2–positive tumors to evaluate the direct effects of COX2 inhibitors on in vitro growth (Fig. 1A). ASA did not exhibit
significant growth inhibitory effects on cultured glioma cells
at up to 10 mmol/L (¼ 1.8 mg/L culture medium; Fig. 1A,
left). In contrast, celecoxib (Fig. 1A, middle) and dimethylcelecoxib (Fig. 1A, right) inhibited glioma cell growth at

Figure 1. Effects of NSAIDs on glioma development. Gliomas were induced in neonatal C57BL/6 mice by intraventricular transfection of the following
plasmids: pT2/C-Luc//PGK-SB13 (0.2 mg), pT/CAGGS-NRASV12 (0.4 mg), and pT2/shp53 (0.4 mg). A, glioma cell lines were established from WT mice and
treated in vitro with the following NSAIDs at indicated concentrations: ASA (left), celecoxib (middle), and dimethylcelecoxib (right). The cells were incubated for
24 hours, and WST-1 assay was conducted for cell viability. Untreated cells were used as a control. B, supernatants were collected from A to conduct
ELISA for PGE2 levels. C, mice with developing tumors received daily treatment of ASA (left and middle) or celecoxib (right) with indicated doses by oral gavage
or through drinking water initiated on indicated days. Symptom-free survival was monitored. P values are based on the log-rank test. "Med" in the tables
stands for median survival. D, plasma samples were collected from these mice at days 50 to 60 to conduct ELISA for systemic PGE2 levels. Numbers in the
"ASA" section represent the days the treatment was initiated. A, B, and D, lines within boxes denote means; box upper and lower bounds indicate
SDs; whiskers indicate minimum and maximum values. P values are based on Holm's post hoc test.

similar concentrations, which is consistent with the
reported direct cell growth inhibitory effects of these agents
(19). Concurrent with Supplementary Figure S2, cultured
glioma cells produced PGE2 at high levels (P < 0.001; Fig. 1B).
Moreover, both ASA and celecoxib significantly inhibited
PGE2 production from glioma cells at a concentration of 10
mmol/L (P < 0.001; Fig. 1B). These data suggest that ASA
inhibits PGE2 production from the glioma cells without
affecting glioma cell growth whereas celecoxib inhibits both
glioma cell growth and glioma cells PGE2 production.
Next, we used ASA and celecoxib in vivo to treat mice
with developing gliomas (Fig. 1C). With regard to the
administered dose, it has been reported that 20% to 50%
of administered reagents remain active for 8 to 24 hours in
the blood circulation (20). Therefore, in vivo administration
of ASA at 10 mg/kg/d in mice would exhibit a similar
concentration in the body as that tested in vitro (1.8
mg/L). We also determined the dose of celecoxib to deliver
in vivo (30 mg/kg/d in mice) that is equivalent to the
clinical use (400 mg/d in human; refs. 13, 14). Daily 10
mg/kg ASA treatment initiated at the time of glioma
induction significantly inhibited glioma development in
WT mice, with 3 of 8 treated mice surviving longer than
120 days (P ¼ 0.0411; Fig. 1C, left). In contrast, we observed
no therapeutic effects when the treatment was initiated on
day 21 (Fig. 1C, middle), by which time solid gliomas were
established (Supplementary Fig. S1B). However, 30 mg/kg
celecoxib was effective in inhibition of glioma development
even when the treatment was started on day 21 (P ¼ 0.0269;
Fig. 1C, right), suggesting the involvement of its direct
inhibitory effect on glioma cell growth (19).
We then addressed whether these treatments would
reduce plasma PGE2 levels in the mice with developing
gliomas (Fig. 1D). The ASA treatment significantly reduced
plasma PGE2 levels in glioma-free mice (P ¼ 0.012; Fig. 1D,
left). The mice with gliomas at days 50 to 60 exhibited higher
plasma PGE2 levels than those in the glioma-free mice (P <
0.001), which were reduced by the daily ASA treatment. The
mice receiving the ASA treatment starting at day 0 showed
slightly reduced PGE2 levels compared with the ones receiving treatment at day 21 (P ¼ 0.0457). As the tumor size was
not significantly different between the ASA- versus PBStreated groups, based on bioluminescence measurement
(data not shown; ref. 10), the observed reduction in PGE2
levels is not likely due to merely smaller size of tumors in
ASA-treated mice. Consistent with these data, the celecoxib
treatment significantly reduced PGE2 levels compared with
the control treatment (P < 0.001; Fig. 1D, right). Taken
together, these findings indicate that COX-2 blockade by
NSAIDs may exert protective (rather than therapeutic)
effects on gliomagenesis, possibly through systemic PGE2
inhibition. On the basis of the findings that pharmacologic
concentrations of celecoxib directly inhibit the proliferation
of glioma cells (Fig. 1A), we thought that daily in vivo
administration of ASA in mice with developing gliomas
would reveal unique immune-mediated mechanisms operating in vivo without directly inhibiting the growth of glioma
cells.

www.aacrjournals.org

The protective effect of ASA is concomitant with a
decrease in systemic and tumor-infiltrating
CD11bþLy6GþLy6Clo granulocytic MDSCs along with an
increase in CD107aþ cytotoxic T lymphocytes
The results discussed in Figure 1 led us to examine the
immunologic TME in response to the NSAID treatment. To
this end, we extracted total RNA from brains, spleens, and
bone marrows of the mice treated with ASA to evaluate the
expression levels of Ccl2 and Cxcl10, chemokines known to
attract MDSCs (8, 21) and activated T cells (17, 18), respectively. Glioma tissues exhibited high Ccl2 expression levels,
which were significantly suppressed when daily ASA treatment initiated on day 0 (P ¼ 0.0251; Fig. 2A, top left). In
contrast, although Ccl2 mRNA levels increased in the spleens
and bone marrows of glioma-bearing mice compared with
glioma-free mice, ASA treatment did not inhibit the Ccl2
expressions in these organs (Fig. 2A, top middle and right).
Similar to the Ccl2 expression profile, the mice with developing gliomas also exhibited higher expression levels of
Cxcl10 in the TME than those in the glioma-free mice (P
< 0.001; Fig. 2A, bottom left). The daily ASA treatment
further enhanced the Cxcl10 expression levels in the TME
(P ¼ 0.0261). In contrast, we observed no alteration of Cxcl10
expression levels in either the spleen or bone marrow in the
presence or absence of the ASA treatment (bottom middle
and right).
Although the data described earlier suggest that the ASA
treatment would affect MDSC accumulation in the TME,
the COX-2 pathway is known to promote systemic MDSC
development in tumor-bearing mice (5). Therefore, we
sought to evaluate the status of MDSCs in the organs
tested earlier. The ASA-treated mice exhibited significant
decreases in both frequencies and absolute numbers of
CD11bþLy6GhiLy6Clo gMDSCs in the gliomas (P ¼ 0.032)
and bone marrows (P ¼ 0.0199) when compared with the
PBS-treated mice (Fig. 2B). In contrast, we observed no
significant differences in CD11bþLy6GloLy6Chi mMDSCs in
these organs.
Because MDSCs are known to exert their biological effects
by producing arginase-1 and iNOS (also known as NOS2;
ref. 7), we extracted total RNA from the sorted gMDSCs
and mMDSCs to evaluate mRNA levels of these effector
molecules (Fig. 2C). The ASA treatment significantly inhibited
Nos2 expressions in gMDSCs in all the organs tested (Fig. 2C,
left). However, the treatment significantly inhibited the Nos2
expression levels only in the glioma-infiltrating mMDSCs (P ¼
0.050) but not of those present in the other organs (Fig. 2C,
right). We observed no effects in Arg1 expression levels by ASA
treatment in any of the 3 sites (data not shown).
Consistent with the significant increase of Cxcl10 observed
in the TME (Fig. 2A, bottom left), the ASA-treated mice
exhibited an increase in glioma-infiltrating CD8þ T cells
compared with the PBS-treated mice (P ¼ 0.020; Fig. 2D).
Moreover, the CD8þ T cells in the ASA-treated mice showed
increased cell surface levels of a degranulation marker CD107a
[mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) levels 9.8 vs. 6.4; ref. 22],
suggesting improved effector functions of these cells compared with those in PBS-treated mice.

COX-2 Blockade and Gliomagenesis

and Cox-2þ/þ mice. A, symptom-free survival was monitored. B, plasma samples were collected as described in Figure 1 to conduct ELISA for systemic PGE2
levels. C, total RNA was extracted from the mouse brains as described in Figure 2 to conduct quantitative RT-PCR for mRNA expression levels of Ccl2 (left) and

Deletion of Cox-2 alleles leads to similar effects to those
by the ASA treatment
The results discussed earlier led us to determine the specific
roles of Cox-2 gene in gliomagenesis. In particular, we directed
our focus on the TME because we observed the most significant changes in both chemokine profiles and immune cell
infiltrations in the brain. To this end, we induced de novo
gliomas in Cox-2þ/þ, Cox-2þ/, and Cox-2/ mice. The Cox2/ mice exhibited a delay in glioma development compared
with the Cox-2þ/þ or Cox-2þ/ mice (P  0.0478), with 5 of 6
Cox-2/ mice surviving longer than 150 days (Fig. 3A). The
Cox-2þ/ mice also exhibited prolonged survival (P ¼ 0.0255),
with 4 of 14 mice surviving longer than 150 days, compared
with the Cox-2þ/þ mice, none of which survived longer than
119 days. Consistent with these data, plasma PGE2 levels were
significantly decreased in the Cox-2þ/ mice compared with
the Cox-2þ/þ mice (P < 0.001), and the levels were further
decreased in Cox-2/ mice (P < 0.001; Fig. 3B). When we
evaluated the effects of Cox-2 gene status on chemokine
expressions in the TME, the Cox-2/ mice exhibited lower
levels of Ccl2 (P  0.016) and higher levels of Cxcl10 (P 
0.0032) than the Cox-2þ/þ or Cox-2þ/ mice (Fig. 3C). Consistent with this, the Cox-2/ mice exhibited a decrease in
glioma-infiltrating Gr-1þ MDSCs (P ¼ 0.0016; Fig. 3D, top)

www.aacrjournals.org

with a concurrent increase in CD8þ T cells (P < 0.001; Fig. 3D,
bottom). Taken together, these data show that the gliomabearing Cox-2/ mice exhibit a similar phenotype to that of
the ASA-treated mice and suggest that the ASA treatment
exerts its main biological effects through suppression of the
COX-2/PGE2 pathway.
To determine whether altered Cox-2 gene expression levels
in glioma cells influenced their proliferation, we established
glioma cell lines from glioma tissues obtained from the Cox2þ/þ and Cox-2þ/ mice. Although we were unable to establish
Cox-2/ glioma cells due to the lack of consistent tumor
formation in these mice, Cox-2þ/þ and Cox-2þ/ glioma cells
proliferated at similar rates in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Endogenous CCL2 promotes glioma development and
tumor infiltration of MDSCs
These data led us to hypothesize that the ASA treatment
would induce dynamic changes in chemokine expression
profiles in the TME, thereby reducing MDSCs and increasing
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). As CCL2 is known to be a
primary chemokine that attracts MDSCs (8), we sought to
evaluate direct impacts of CCL2 by inducing gliomas in Ccl2/
mice. These mice exhibited a significant delay in glioma
development, with 3 of 10 mice surviving longer than 120 days

(P ¼ 0.0188; Fig. 4A). In addition, the Ccl2/ mice exhibited an
increase in Cxcl10 expression levels in the TME compared with
WT mice (P ¼ 0.0347; Fig. 4B). When BILs were analyzed, the
Ccl2/ mice exhibited a decrease in Gr-1þ MDSCs (P ¼ 0.0031;
Fig. 4C, top) and an increase in CD8þ T cells (P ¼ 0.021; Fig. 4C,

suggest an important role of CCL2 in accumulation of not only
MDSCs but also CD8þ T cells in the TME.

which was consistent with the observation in the Ccl2/ mice
(Fig. 4B). The mAb-treated mice exhibited a decrease in
glioma-infiltrating Gr-1þ MDSCs (P ¼ 0.014; Fig. 5C, top)
and an increase in CD8þ T cells (P ¼ 0.023; Fig. 5C, bottom).
Our combined results from COX-2 blockade, Ccl2 deficiency,
and MDSC depletion have uncovered a previously undescribed
role of MDSCs in suppressing the expression of CXCL10, a
critical chemokine for CD8þ T-cell recruitment into the TME.

mAb-mediated depletion of Gr-1þ cells inhibits the
glioma development
To gain a better understanding of the relationship between

glioma-developing WT mice with anti–Gr-1 mAb to deplete
Gr-1þ MDSCs. Consistent with our previous data in type 1
interferon receptor–deficient mice (10), WT mice with developing gliomas that had received anti–Gr-1 mAb for systemic
MDSC depletion exhibited a prolonged survival, with 4 of 9
mice surviving longer than 120 days (P ¼ 0.0063; Fig. 5A).
Furthermore, the mAb-treated mice exhibited an increase in
Cxcl10 expression levels in the TME (P ¼ 0.0082; Fig. 5B),

To address the specific roles of CXCL10 in gliomagenesis,
we induced de novo gliomas in Cxcl10/ mice, which with
developing gliomas exhibited significantly shorter survival
than WT mice (P ¼ 0.0171; Fig. 6A). The Cxcl10/ mice also
exhibited a decrease in CD8þ T-cell infiltration (P ¼ 0.0079;

vs. 16.7), revealing a potential functional deficiency in addition

with previous reports showing that CXCL10 in the TME rather
than CXCR3 plays a predominant role in tumor infiltration of
CTLs (17, 18). Collectively, this study indicates important roles
of the COX-2 pathway in gliomagenesis through systemic
development of MDSCs and their CCL2-mediated accumulation in the TME along with a reduction of CXCL10-mediated
tumor infiltration of CTLs.

Discussion
This is the first report documenting the immunologic
significance of the COX-2 pathway in gliomagenesis in mice.
In this study, treatment with ASA or celecoxib inhibited
systemic PGE2 production and delayed glioma development.
This was especially true when the treatment was initiated
shortly after the glioma induction, suggesting significant
involvement of the COX-2 pathway in the early stage of
gliomagenesis. We also showed a pivotal role of MDSCs
and the MDSC-attracting chemokine CCL2 in the COX-2–
mediated gliomagenesis.
The role of PGE2 in MDSC development has been reviewed
(23). In particular, Ep2 (one of PGE2 receptors)-deficient mice
bearing 4T1 mammary carcinoma showed a decrease in
MDSC development and delayed tumor growth compared
with WT mice (5). In this study, we showed for the first time

www.aacrjournals.org

that COX-2 blockade by NSAIDs and genetic deletion of Cox-2
suppress glioma development in mice, primarily by inhibiting
MDSC accumulation in the TME (Figs. 1–3). We also observed
a negative correlation between MDSCs and degranulating
(CD107aþ) CD8þ T cells in the TME (Figs. 4C and 5C),
suggesting that MDSCs suppress the effector function of
CD8þ T cells in the TME and thereby facilitate glioma
progression.
Although the ASA treatment inhibited systemic PGE2 levels
regardless of the timing to be initiated, it did not provide any
therapeutic benefit when it was initiated after the tumor had
already been established (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1).
Similarly, while homozygous Cox-2/ mice showed remarkably prolonged survival compared with Cox-2þ/þ mice (P <
0.0478), heterozygous Cox-2þ/ mice showed only modest,
albeit significant, prolongation of survival and reduction in
plasma PGE2 levels compared with Cox-2þ/þ mice (Fig. 3A and
B). Furthermore, the heterozygous Cox-2þ/ mice did not
show significant differences in chemokine expressions and
BIL profiles compared with Cox-2þ/þ mice (Fig. 3C and D).
These data, together with remarkable suppression of PGE2
levels by the ASA treatment (Fig. 1B), imply that a substantial
threshold of PGE2 suppression has to be achieved to observe
the clinical benefit of this strategy. These observations also
suggest that ASA administration in humans might be only

beneficial in prophylactic settings but not in patients with
clinically diagnosed gliomas. Consistent with our interpretation, a recent study has shown that long-term use of ASA
reduces cancer risks in human (24).
With regard to the effects of ASA on each of the 2 distinct
MDSC populations (Ly6GhiLy6Clo gMDSCs and Ly6GLy6Chi
mMDSCs), the ASA treatment preferentially reduced
gMDSCs compared with mMDSCs in the organs tested
(Fig. 2B). Taken together with a previous study showing
that expansion of gMDSCs occurs at a greater degree under
inflammatory conditions than that of mMDSCs (25),
gMDSCs may be more susceptible than mMDSCs to
PGE2-mediated expansion and NSAID-mediated suppression. With regard to their functional differences, several
studies have collectively indicated that gMDSCs preferentially express arginase-1 through the STAT3 signaling
whereas mMDSCs express iNOS through the STAT1 signaling (7). Of interest, this proposed paradigm contrasts with
our data showing that gMDSCs also express iNOS that can be
inhibited by ASA (Fig. 2C). Therefore, it is possible that our
observations are unique to gliomas. Further studies are
warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the
suppressive effects of each of MDSC populations in both
human and mouse cancers located in a variety of organs.
CCL2 is known to be one of the primary chemokines
attracting MDSCs toward the TME (8), which is consistent
with our observation that genetic depletion of Ccl2 induced a
significant decrease in MDSC accumulation in the TME
(Fig. 4). In detail, both gMDSCs and mMDSCs express the
receptor CCR2, although its expression levels have been shown
to be higher on mMDSCs than on gMDSCs (26). This observation suggests that the CCL2–CCR2 chemokine receptor axis
can mediate the migration of both gMDSCs and mMDSCs.

Cancer Res; 71(7) April 1, 2011

Simultaneously, our data showed that CCL2 blockade (and
resulting inhibition of MDSCs) led to increases of Cxcl10
expression and CD8þ T-cell infiltration in the TME (Figs. 4
and 5). This contrasts with a previous study showing that
CCL2 mediates accumulation of activated T cells in a glioma
xenograft (27). We think that this difference reflects the
immunocompetent status of mice in our spontaneous tumor
model versus the xenograft model that requires immunodeficient hosts. Given that CCR2, a cognate receptor for CCL2, is
expressed in a wide range of immune cells including monocytes, MDSCs, Tregs, and effector T cells (28), the CCL2–CCR2
axis operates in all cell populations that express the ligand
CCL2 and/or the receptor CCR2 in our syngeneic glioma
model. However, CCL2 in the TME is likely to recruit primarily
MDSCs (8). Then, MDSCs inhibit the type 1 functions of
dendritic cells (DC; refs. 29, 30), including DC production of
CXCL10 (18, 31). Taken together, we propose that CCL2attracting MDSCs inhibit CXCL10 production in the TME
through suppression of DCs.
COX-2 and PGE2 promote de novo induction of Tregs (32).
Consistent with this, the ASA treatment inhibited Treg accumulation in the TME in our model (Supplementary Fig. S4). In
this regard, we have previously attempted to address a role of
Tregs in gliomagenesis by mAb-mediated depletion (10) and
observed no significant effects of Treg depletion on glioma
development. Therefore, we rather focused on the roles of
MDSCs in this study. To elucidate a role of Tregs further, we
are currently incorporating a Treg-attracting chemokine
CCL22 in the SB-mediated glioma induction system; this
system will allow us to address specific effects of CCL22 in
the TME and glioma-infiltrating Tregs attracted by CCL22.
Furthermore, it has been shown that glioma cell–derived
CCL2 promotes Treg migration (33). We will elucidate the

impact of these chemokines on Treg development and accumulation in future studies.
Collectively, the findings in this study reveal the important
roles of the COX-2 pathway in gliomagenesis through an
increase in MDSC development and accumulation and a
decrease in CXCL10-mediated CD8þ T-cell infiltration in
the TME. The data also support development of immunoprevention strategies that could be implemented in people with
an increased risk for glioma development. To this end, it will
be critical to gain a better understanding of the etiology and
risk factors for glioma development in humans. Although risk
factors for gliomas are still largely unknown, patients with
LGGs are known to be at extremely high risks for developing
HGGs (34). On the basis of our data showing that early-stage
gliomas on day 21 resemble human LGGs (Supplementary
Fig. S1) and that celecoxib treatment starting on day 21 is
effective (Fig. 1B), patients with LGGs may benefit from
celecoxib treatment to reduce the risk for malignant progression with HGGs.
With regard to novel risk factors for glioma, we recently
reported that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in
IFNAR1 and IFNA8 correlate with altered overall survival of
patients with WHO grade 2 and 3 gliomas (10). Others have
reported that SNPs in IL-4R and CX3CR1 correlate with
survival of glioma patients (35–38). Although these data do
not directly dictate risk factors for glioma development, it
might be helpful to reveal functional significance of these

SNPs in order to identify individuals who are at a risk of
developing gliomas and are likely to benefit from future
clinical trials with NSAID-based immunoprevention. On the
basis of this study, future studies evaluating SNPs in Cox-2,
Ccl2, and Cxcl10 in relation to glioma risks and prognosis are
warranted.
