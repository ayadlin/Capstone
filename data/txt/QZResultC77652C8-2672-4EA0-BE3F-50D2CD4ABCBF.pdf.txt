Abstract
Octamer 4 (Oct4), a member of the POU family of transcription factors, plays a key role in the maintenance of
pluripotency and proliferation potential of embryonic stem
cells. Cancer stem cell–like cells (CSCLC) are reported to be a
minor population in tumors or even in tumor cell lines which
also express Oct4. The role of Oct4 in CSCLCs still remains to
be defined. In our study, we show that, in vitro, almost all
murine Lewis lung carcinoma 3LL cells and human breast
cancer MCF7 cells express Oct4 at high levels. This expression
of Oct4 is successfully reduced by small interfering RNA, which
eventually results in cell apoptosis. The signal pathway Oct4/
Tcl1/Akt1 has been observed to be involved in this event. The
repression of Oct4 reduces Tcl1 expression and further downregulates the level of p-Ser.473-Akt1. In vivo, only f5% of
tumor cells were detected to express Oct4 in established 3LL
and MCF7 tumor models, respectively. Small interfering RNA
against Oct4 successfully decreases the CSCLCs and markedly
inhibits tumor growth. In summary, we show that Oct4 might
maintain the survival of CSCLCs partly through Oct4/Tcl1/
Akt1 by inhibiting apoptosis, which strongly indicates that
targeting Oct4 may have important clinical applications in
cancer therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(16):6533–40]

Introduction
Although much progress has been made in the diagnosis and
treatment of cancer over the past decades, evidence strongly
indicates that the current treatments usually just hold the tumor at
bay and the patients are not truly cured. Successfully eradicating
this disease therefore requires a better understanding of how
cancer initiates and progresses. Cancer stem cell–like cells (CSCLC)
are now thought to play key roles in cancer initiation and
development (1–7). Developing approaches to specifically target
malignant stem cells by applying the principles of stem cell biology
might raise hope to cure this disease.
Emerging data indicate that CSCLCs express normal stem cell
features and might thus harbor unique cell survival signal pathways
that regulate the behavior of normal stem cells (8–12). The
principles that cover the regulation of stem cell behavior include
specific mechanisms for two important features: pluripotency and
the potential for unlimited proliferation. Normal stem cells either
remain in an undifferentiated state, which gives them the potential
to recreate themselves through self-renewal and unlimited life

span, or they quickly begin differentiating and lose their
unique capacity for self-renewal. The pluripotency of stem cells
is maintained by signal pathways headed by octamer 4 (Oct4;
refs. 13, 14), Nanog (15), and BMPs (16), etc. Among them, Oct4
has been studied extensively. The Oct4 gene, a member of the
POU family of transcription factors, was shown to be expressed in
both embryonic and adult stem cells (13, 14, 17). Recent investigations indicate that Oct4 is involved in controlling not only the
maintenance of embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency but also
the proliferation potential. The signal pathway Oct4/Tcl1/Akt1 is
identified to be involved in ES cell proliferation, which functions
by inhibiting the apoptosis of ES cells (18). Very interestingly,
Oct4 is also detected in germ cell tumors (1, 12) and some
somatic tumors such as hepatoma (Mahlava cells; refs. 1, 19),
breast cancer (6, 20), bladder cancer (21, 22), melanoma
(B16F10),4 etc. Although many cancer cells are observed to
express Oct4, very little is known about its potential function in
cancers.
To date, CSCLCs have been defined and isolated from cancers
belonging to a number of different tissues/organs with different
markers (23–25). Many of these cancer cells are shown to possess
stem cell properties because of their expression of Oct4. Oct4,
therefore, seems to be an important marker for CSCLCs. Thus, it is
important to address whether the expression of Oct4 is involved in
the maintenance of CSCLC’s survival.
Some research indicates that Oct4 might play a key role in
maintaining the survival of cancer cells. Continuous Oct4
expression in epithelial tissues is observed to lead to dysplastic
disorders by inhibiting cellular differentiation in a manner similar
to that in embryonic cells (26). Oct4 has also been reported to be
an oncogenic fate determinant. High levels of Oct4 increase the
malignant potential of ES-derived tumors whereas inactivation of
Oct4 induces a regression of the malignant component (27). This
suggests that Oct4 might play a critical role in the genesis of
tumors.
Based on those findings, our study attempts to show that if we
can turn off expression of the Oct4 signal used to maintain the
pluripotency and survival of stem cells, and therefore, potentially of
cancer cells, we might be able to successfully halt and reverse the
progression of cancer. RNA interference (RNAi) technology involves
an oligonucleotide sequence that targets and degrades complementary mRNA in the cell, thereby inhibiting gene expression
in vitro and in vivo (28). In our study, RNAi was used to inhibit Oct4
gene expression in two somatic tumor models (mouse 3LL cell line
and human MCF7 breast cell line). Our results show, for the first
time, that the reduction of Oct4 in somatic tumor cells leads to
tumor cell apoptosis and inhibition of tumor growth, which is
partly mediated by an ES cell pathway, Oct4/Tcl1/Akt1.

Oct4 RNAi in vitro. Transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) was
performed by using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
recommendations of the manufacturer. Murine 3LL and human MCF7
tumor cells grown to a confluency of 50% to 60% in six-well plates were
transfected with 5 Ag of plasmids without siRNA per well. For staining,
murine 3LL tumor cells were grown on gelatin-coated coverslips and siRNAtreated as above. After 24 h, cells were harvested and immunostained as
described in ‘‘Flow cytometry analysis.’’ The coverslips were washed with
PBS and fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS at room temperature
for 10 min. The coverslips were then washed with PBS and stained with
Hoechst 33258 for 2 min and observed under fluorescence microscope.
Histologic analysis. Murine 3LL tumors were established by intradermally injecting 0.25  106 tumor cells (in 50 AL of RPMI 1640) into the
back flanks of female C57BL/6 mice (day 0). On day 4, reporter plasmids
(100 Ag/100 AL PBS buffer for each tumor) were injected intratumorally.
One day later, tumors were taken out and embedded in optimum cutting
temperature compound (Sakura Finetek), and then sectioned and observed
under a fluorescence microscope.
For the detection of Oct4 expression in tumors, indirect fluorescence
immunohistochemical staining was performed on sections of untreated
4-day established 3LL tumor. Eight-micrometer frozen sections were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. After washing with PBS,
tumor sections were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and then
blocked for 60 min with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum. The
sections were then incubated with primary antibody (rat anti-human/
mouse Oct4 mAb; 1:50) or PBS only as control overnight at 4jC. The
primary antibodies were removed and sections were washed with PBS and
incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 555–conjugated goat anti-rat secondary
antibodies (1:400) in the dark. Fluorescent images were obtained using
Olympus fluorescence microscope system.
Flow cytometric analysis. In order to quantify for Oct4-positive tumor
cells in established tumors, 3LL tumors were established as described
above. Also, human MCF7 tumors were established as described previously
(29). In brief, human MCF7 tumors were established by intradermally
injecting 1  107 tumor cells (in 50 AL of DMEM) into the back flanks of
female athymic nude mice. On day 4 (3LL) or day 10 (MCF7), tumors were
treated with different plasmids (100 Ag/per tumor). The next day, untreated
tumors were each excised and single cell suspensions were prepared as
described previously (30, 31).
The single cell suspension was analyzed by direct or indirect fluorescent
immunostaining. The expression of Oct4 in tumors was detected by direct
fluorescent immunostaining as described in our previous report (30, 32).
The levels of Tcl1, Akt1, and P-Akt1 were assessed by indirect fluorescent
immunostaining as follows: the cells were trypsinized and collected
24 h post-siRNA against Oct4 treatment and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature after PBS washing. Cells were then
incubated with 0.5% Tween 20/3% normal goat serum (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and the cells were
washed with PBS followed by incubation with 3% normal goat serum
(blocking solutions) for another 15 min at room temperature. The primary
antibodies were added to the cells at a ratio of 1:25 (Tcl1) and 1:50 (P-Akt1,
Akt1), respectively. As controls, some samples were given only blocking
solutions. All cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The
secondary antibodies were then added in dilution, respectively, according to
the supplier’s recommendation and the tubes were incubated for 45 min at
room temperature in the dark.
Apoptotic cells were detected with an Annexin V FITC kit and stained
according the instructions of the manufacturer. Data were analyzed using
the CellQuestPro software (BD Biosciences), if necessary, 106 total cell
events were analyzed.
Oct4 siRNA therapy. For Oct4 siRNA therapy in the 3LL tumor model,
tumors were established ( five mice for each treatment group), as described
above (day 0). On days 4, 6, and 8, 100 Ag of plasmid (in 100 AL PBS) were
injected intratumorally. In order to assess the inhibition effect of Oct4
siRNA on the growth of human MCF7 in vivo, female athymic nude mice at
4 to 6 weeks of age were simultaneously injected intradermally with 107 (in
50 AL of DMEM) of MCF7 into the back flanks. On days 10, 12, and 14, 100

Oct4 siRNA Results in Apoptosis of CSCLCs
Ag of plasmid (in 100 AL PBS) were injected intratumorally. Tumor sizes
were measured twice weekly. Mice were euthanized when their tumors
exceeded 400 mm2 in size.

The difference was deemed statistically significant at P < 0.05.

Results
Reduction of Oct4 expression by siRNA results in murine
3LL tumor cell apoptosis in vitro. CSCLCs, shown to express
Oct4 which is indicative of their stem cell property, are reported to
comprise only a very small population in a tumor or even in a
tumor cell line (33). In order to carry out our study to target Oct4
by RNAi, we first identified the Oct4-positive cell population in
murine 3LL tumor cell line. To this end, 3LL cells were
immunostained with Oct4 antibody and analyzed by flow
cytometry. Very surprisingly, almost all of the cells expressed
Oct4 at a high level, compared with isotype antibody (iso) staining
(Fig. 1A). Subsequently, we tested whether the expression of Oct4
could be reduced or inhibited by siRNA against Oct4. For this
purpose, we chose four different siRNA target sites on mouse and

Figure 1. The expression of Oct4 was inhibited by siRNA. A, murine 3LL cells
were stained with PE-labeled Oct4 mAbs (right ) or isotype-matched control
mAbs (left ), respectively, and analyzed by flow cytometry. B, murine 3LL
cells were transfected with PLKO.1-SC (SC ), PLKO.1-shRNA1 (Sh1 ), and
PLKO.1-shRNA2 (Sh2 ), respectively. Twenty-four hours later, transfected cells
were immunostained with PE-labeled Oct4 mAbs (thick line ). As a control,
untreated 3LL cells were also stained with Oct4 mAbs (Con, thin line ) or
isotype-matched control mAbs (Iso, dotted line ). C, intensity of the expression of
Oct4 shown by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI ). The differences were

human Oct4 mRNA sequences and designed four different siRNA
sequences under Ambion’s recommended procedure. In the
meantime, scrambling sequences for each siRNA sequence were
designed as controls. The sequences were termed as Sh1–4 for
mouse Oct4 siRNA sequences and huSh1–4 for human Oct4 siRNA
sequences, respectively. Oct4 was immunostained and detected by
flow cytometer for screening the effective shRNA. The most
effective shRNA, its scrambling control, and less effective shRNA
(as target site–specific control) were used throughout the present
study (see Materials and Methods).
Delivering SC into the cells did not lead to a significant
reduction of the expression of Oct4, compared with that of the
control untreated 3LL cells (Fig. 1B, left). This excluded the
possibility of inhibiting the expression of Oct4 by general
nonspecific effects using siRNA. Transfection of both Sh1 and
Sh2, however, effectively reduced the expression of Oct4. Sh1
decreased the expression of Oct4 more than Sh2 (Fig. 1B, middle
and right, and Fig. 1C). In order to assess the viability of tumor cells
with the reduction of Oct4, the nuclei were stained with Hoechst
33258 and observed using a fluorescence microscope. More nuclei
in Sh1- and Sh2-transfected cells displayed granular blue fluorescence, which indicated apoptotic bodies forming, compared with
that in the untreated control or SC-transfected cells (Fig. 2A,
arrows). The cells in different groups were further double-stained
with Annexin V and propidium iodide and analyzed by flow
cytometry, exhibiting Annexin V–positive/propidium iodide–negative apoptotic properties (Fig. 2B). Quantification of these cell
populations using flow cytometry showed that, compared with an
apoptosis rate in untreated cells, transfection of SC did not result in
a significantly higher rate of apoptosis (9% versus 12%).
Transfection of Sh1 caused a significant increase in apoptosis rate
(up to 48%). Transfection of Sh2 also led to tumor cell apoptosis,
but the apoptosis was lower, only 17% (Fig. 2C). The rate of
apoptosis was proportional to the decrease in the expression
of Oct4.
Collectively, almost all in vitro cultured 3LL tumor cells
expressed Oct4 at a high level, which was successfully reduced by
siRNA against Oct4, and finally resulted in tumor cell apoptosis.
SiRNA against Oct4 leads to a reduction of Tcl1 expression
and further down-regulation of the level of p-Ser.473-Akt1.
Having documented that decreasing the expression of Oct4 induces
tumor cell apoptosis, we next set out to determine the possible
underlying mechanisms. A recent report revealed an Oct4/Tcl1/
Akt1 pathway which acts, not directly on ES cell differentiation, but
on proliferation through analysis of an Oct4-transcriptionally
controlled gene list (18). In this pathway, Tcl1 enhances the kinase
activity of Akt1 whose activation could promote cell proliferation
and inhibit apoptosis (34). It has also been reported that embryonic
and tumorigenic pathways converge via Nodal signaling (35) and
Tcl1 is well known as an oncogene. It is thus reasonable to ask
whether this pathway is involved in controlling tumor cell
proliferation. To answer this question, the changes in the
expression of Tcl1 and Akt1 were assessed. Because Tcl1 has been
shown to be transcriptionally controlled by Oct4 in ES cells, the
change in Tcl1 at the RNA level in tumor cells was confirmed by
RT-PCR. The results showed that the repression of the level of Tcl1
mRNA was proportional to the level of decrease of the expression
of Oct4 (Fig. 3A). The protein levels of Tcl1 and Akt1 were
subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry. The change in the
protein level of Tcl1 was consistent with the mRNA change (Fig. 3B
and C, left). Consistently, the active form of Akt1, which is

phosphorylated at the Ser473 site (P-akt1), was significantly reduced
in cells in which the expression of Oct4 was markedly reduced
(Fig. 3B, middle; and Fig. 3C, right). However, the total amount of
Akt1 protein was unchanged (Fig. 3B, right).
Together, these results indicate that the Oct4/Tcl1/Akt1 pathway
was activated and then, at least partly, mediated tumor cell
apoptosis. This, in turn, suggests that Oct4 might maintain the
proliferative potential by inhibiting apoptosis.
SiRNA against Oct4 could induce CSCLC’s apoptosis in vivo
and markedly inhibit tumor growth. Next, we wanted to assess
the capacity of Oct4 siRNA to induce apoptosis in CSCLCs
(exhibiting Oct4-positive properties) in vivo in the 3LL tumor
model. As a prelude, we first identified the expression pattern of
Oct4 in established 3LL tumors. Very surprisingly, on day 4 post–
Oct4-positive 3LL tumor cell inoculation, only a very minor
population of tumor cells expressed Oct4 (Fig. 4A, arrows), as
observed under a fluorescence microscope after immunohistochemical staining. Further quantification analysis by flow
cytometry showed that only f5% of the total tumor cells were
Oct4-positive (Fig. 4B), indicating that this small population might
be CSCLCs. As a control, tumor cells were also stained with
isotype-matched antibodies. Very few, if any, PE-positive cells were
found (data not shown). Subsequently, we investigated the efficacy
of delivering siRNA into tumor cells in vivo by direct intratumoral
injection. To this end, reporter plasmids were constructed with
GFP and then these recombinant plasmids were directly injected
into the tumor. We observed that the recombinant plasmids were
successfully delivered into the cells at the tumor site as they
exhibited the expression of GFP in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells
(Fig. 4C, arrowheads). In the tumors treated with recombinant
plasmids carrying Sh sequences, there were some scattered pockets
of apoptotic cells with enhanced GFP intensity (Fig. 4C, arrow-

heads). Consistent with in vitro results (Fig. 2A), more apoptotic
cells in tumors injected with Sh1 were observed than in tumors
injected with Sh2. In order to confirm that the apoptotic cells were
CSCLCs, quantification analysis was performed by flow cytometry.
Of note, dead cells undergoing apoptosis are relatively fragile and
readily lysed during the processing of single tumor cell suspensions. Consequently, we chose to quantify live CSCLCs. Given that
tumors, inevitably, varied in size at the time of harvest for the
assessment, we quantified the live CSCLCs in 1  106 total tumor
cells to normalize the results from different tumor samples. As
expected, when compared with mice treated with SC, transfection
of Sh1 resulted in a dramatic decrease in intratumoral CSCLCs. In
comparison, mice treated with Sh2 showed a significant, but
weaker, effect on decrease of CSCLCs (Fig. 4D).
Subsequently, we determined whether this specific depletion
could inhibit the growth of established 3LL tumors. As negative
controls, nontreated mice (Con) and SC-treated mice (SC), all
showed progressive tumor growth and died, whereas the mice
treated with Sh1 and Sh2 showed delayed tumor growth. In
comparison, Sh2 intratumoral injection was less effective in
retarding tumor growth compared with Sh1 (Fig. 5A). Although
the treatment did not cure any of the animals, siRNA against Oct4
intratumoral injection significantly prolonged the survival of the
treated mice (Fig. 5B). Collectively, our data indicate that siRNA
against Oct4 could successfully reduce CSCLCs in vivo and thereby
markedly retard tumor growth.
Decrease of the expression of Oct4 promotes human MCF7
breast cancer cell apoptosis and inhibits MCF7 tumor growth
in vivo. Thus far, we have shown that repression of the expression
of Oct4 could successfully induce murine 3LL tumor cells apoptosis
in vitro and in vivo, which might partly be mediated by the Oct4/
Tcl1/Akt1 pathway. Next, we wanted to further solidify our findings

and propidium iodide (PI ), respectively, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Dead cells were Annexin V–positive and propidium iodide–negative, which indicated apoptosis.
C, apoptosis rates between different groups were statistically analyzed. The differences were statistically significant (SC vs. Sh1, SC vs. Sh2, Sh1 vs. Sh2; **, P < 0.01).
Similar results were obtained in three to six independent experiments.

then quantified in established MCF7 tumors in different groups.
Consistent with the results in 3LL tumors, f5% of the total tumor
cells were Oct4-positive in untreated MCF7 tumors. Intratumoral
injection of huSC could not cause a significant decrease in CSCLCs,
whereas huSh2 transfection led to a dramatic decrease in CSCLCs
in established MCF7 tumors (Fig. 6C). The tumor growth curves
showed that the growth of tumor in mice treated with huSh2 was
markedly inhibited, whereas huSC-treated mice (SC), all showed
progressive tumor growth and died (Fig. 6D), which indicated that
the specific depletion of CSCLCs could inhibit the growth of
established MCF7 tumors. Together, these data thus further solidify
our findings concerning the importance of Oct4 expression in
human cancer cells.

in human cancer cells. To this end, we chose the MCF7 breast
cancer cell, a human clinical tumor model. As in the murine 3LL
tumor cell, almost all of the human MCF7 cells expressed Oct4 at a
high level (data not shown). Two Sh sequences against human Oct4
(huSh1 and huSh2, respectively) were shown to successfully
decrease the expression of Oct4 in MCF7 tumor cells. In this case,
huSh1 had a decreased effect compared with that of huSh2
(Fig. 6A). The apoptotic cells were quantified by analysis of Annexin
V–positive cells using flow cytometry. Transfection of either huSh
sequence into cells significantly up-regulated the rate of apoptosis
(Fig. 6B). Transfection of huSh2 markedly reduced the expression of
Oct4 and resulted in >40% of the cells undergoing apoptosis.
Next, we determined the capacity of Oct4 siRNA to induce
apoptosis in CSCLCs in vivo in the MCF7 tumor model by
intratumoral injection of huSh2, which was more effective in
reducing the expression of Oct4 and resulted in more MCF7 cell
apoptosis in vitro. Live CSCLCs in 1  106 total tumor cells were

The in vitro and in vivo studies described here with two cancer
cell lines have been carried out in order to identify a new
therapeutic target against stem cell factor Oct4, which could block
the survival of cancer cells. Oct4 was observed to be expressed at
high levels in all cultured cells of the murine Lewis lung carcinoma
3LL cell line and the human breast cancer MCF7 cell line (Figs. 1A
and 6A). In vivo, only f5% of tumor cells expressed Oct4 in the
established 3LL tumor model (Fig. 4A and B) and MCF7 tumor
model (Fig. 6C). The expression of Oct4 was successfully reduced
by siRNA which eventually resulted in cell apoptosis. Oct4 siRNA
also led to a reduction of Tcl1 expression and further downregulation of the level of p-Ser.473-Akt1 (Fig. 3A). Tumor cells then
exhibited apoptosis and the tumors were shown to be significantly
inhibited (Figs. 5 and 6C). Our study thus shows the feasibility of
treating somatic cancer by depletion of CSCLCs in tumors on the
basis of better understanding of their multipotent state.
A recent report showed that Tcl1 was transcriptionally regulated
by Oct4 in ES cells and that it acts on cell proliferation by
inhibiting apoptosis in ES cells through the Oct4/Tcl1/Akt1
pathway (18). It has also been shown that Tcl1 is not the only
Oct4-transcriptionally regulated gene that controls proliferation in
ES cells. Furthermore, Oct4 is not the only upstream gene for Tcl1.
Also, analysis of the list of Oct4-regulating genes reveals that 25
apoptotic genes, functioning to inhibit apoptosis, are positively
correlated with Oct4 and a number of apoptosis-inducing genes
were found to be negatively correlated with Oct4. This indicates
that ‘‘antiapoptosis’’ is also an important theme for maintaining
the stem cell state (36). Our results thus show that the signaling
pathway governing ES cell proliferation is, at least partly, involved
in controlling the malignant proliferation of cancer cells. Tcl1, an
oncogene (37), is controlled by Oct4 in tumor cells which strongly
supports the stem cell hypothesis of carcinogenesis. It is presumed
that in mutated stem cells or in mutated cells fused with stem
cells, Oct4 might recognize and bind to a domain on the oncogene
promoter to activate oncogene expression, thereby leading to
malignant proliferation of the cells, as well as maintenance of the
multipotent state of CSCLCs. However, Oct4 always maintains the
pluripotent state and survival of stem cells through a very
complicated network (36). Thus, we could not say that this is
the only signaling pathway involved in the maintenance of
CSCLC’s survival.
Although our results show that Oct4 is expressed in a minor
population of established tumors in vivo (f5% of total tumor
cells), almost all cultured cells of murine 3LL and human MCF7 cell
lines expressed Oct4 in vitro. This is inconsistent with some

has been widely used in the isolation of CSCLC and the specific cell
population is considered to be cancer stem cells (40). This side
population of CSCLCs is very rare, varying from 0.01% to 5% in
tumor cell lines (38). CSCLCs are believed to undergo asymmetric
cell division (41), which might be reasonable in vivo but not
in vitro. Asymmetric cell division means that the total number of
mother cells is unchanged. If CSCLCs divide asymmetrically
in vitro, it would be impossible to establish a tumor cell line, even
if 100% of the cells harvested from the tumors were CSCLCs,
because this cell population would decrease with each passage and
finally be lost after a number of passages in vitro. Furthermore,
using the side population technique, only a very minor fraction of
the established cell line was identified to be putative cancer stem
cells. This suggests that in vitro CSCLCs divide symmetrically. In
fact, a certain tumor cell line freshly derived from a tumor is always
a mixture of cells at different stages of differentiation. The progeny
of CSCLCs will then differentiate and go into apoptosis. Thus, it is
reasonable to assume that all the cells of a long-term culture of a
particular tumor cell line are CSCLCs, all express Oct4, which is
consistent with our results. When these cells are then inoculated
back into the body, they will face ‘‘microenvironment selection.’’
This in vivo microenvironment, compared with that in vitro, lacks
the high oxygen levels and unlimited nutrient supply necessary for

Figure 4. SiRNA successfully decreased the minor tumor cell population
expressing Oct4 in the established 3LL tumors in vivo. A, indirect
immunohistochemical staining for Oct4 on sections of 4-day-old established
3LL tumors, photographed by fluorescence microscope. Very small numbers of
Oct4-positive tumor cells were observed (arrows ; bars, 50 Am). B, intradermal
3LL tumors were established in C57BL/6 mice (day 0). On day 4 post-tumor
inoculation, f5 mm tumors were excised and single cell suspensions were
each prepared and stained with PE-Oct4, and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Approximately 5% of total tumor cells in established 3LL tumors were detected to
express Oct4, when compared with isotype-matched control antibody staining.
Data were obtained from one of three independent experiments. C, the reporter
plasmids were intratumorally injected, and 24 h later, tumors were taken out and
sectioned. The plasmids were successfully delivered into tumor cells, exhibiting
the expression of GFP in cytoplasma (arrowheads ), some scattering apoptotic
cells with enhanced GFP intensity were observed in Sh-treated tumors
(arrowheads ). The pictures were photographed by fluorescence microscope
(bars, 25 Am). D, intradermal 3LL tumors were established in C57BL/6 mice
(day 0). On day 4, mice were treated intratumorally with SC or Sh (100 Ag of total
plasmids per tumor). The following day, single-cell suspensions were prepared
from the tumors separately. Quantification analysis of live Oct4-positive tumor
cells was determined by staining the cells as described in B, the number of
specified cells in 1  106 total tumor cells is shown. Columns, mean of six tumor

reports. In the MCF7 cell line, only 0.2% of cells were enriched with
a side population technique, and thus, only this minor fraction of
cells were considered to be putative cancer stem cells (2, 38).
Although it is still under debate (39), the side population technique

Oct4 siRNA Results in Apoptosis of CSCLCs

Figure 6. Oct4 siRNA promoted cell apoptosis in vitro and inhibited MCF7 tumor growth in vivo. A, Oct4 siRNA were performed in human MCF7 cells, 24 h later, the
cells in different groups were stained with PE-labeled Oct4 mAbs (thick line ) or isotype-matched control mAbs (dotted line ), respectively, and analyzed by flow
cytometry. The intensity of staining is shown by mean fluorescence intensity (iso-staining, top left ; and Oct4-staining, top right ). Data are representative of two to four
independent experiments. B, Oct4 siRNA were performed as described in A, cells were stained with Annexin V and analyzed by flow cytometry. The Annexin V–positive
fraction of total cells is shown in each panel. Data are representative of two to four independent experiments. C, intradermal MCF7 tumors were established in
athymic nude mice (day 0). On day10, mice were treated intratumorally with huSC or Sh2 (100 Ag total plasmids per tumor). The following day, single cell suspensions
were prepared from the tumors separately. Quantification analysis of live Oct4-positive tumor cells was determined as described in Fig. 4D . Data are representative of
two independent experiments. D, human MCF7 tumors were established (day 0). Intratumoral transfers were performed on days 10, 12, and 14 (five mice per
treatment group). Tumor size was measured twice every week and graphed for individual animals; each line represents the tumor size of a single animal. The
representation stops when the animal dies. Data are representative of two independent experiments.

growth. Thus, only a very minor population survives and becomes
the ‘‘malignant core.’’
Although we show that siRNA against Oct4 could induce the
apoptosis of CSCLCs, inhibit the growth of established tumors,
and prolong the survival of mice, shRNA-treated tumors
continued to grow albeit at a slower rate. This might be due
to two reasons. One is that CSCLCs were not cleared thoroughly.
Hence, an effective method to introduce shRNAs into established
tumors, and at the same time up-regulate the depletion rate of
CSCLCs, needs to be developed. Another method to reveal the
mechanisms that control the multipotent state and survival of
CSCLCs, which might be helpful and useful, would be to develop
a better approach to induce the apoptosis of CSCLCs. In vitro, ES
cells express Oct4 at a high level to maintain their undifferentiated self-renewing state (13, 14) only upon the addition of
leukemia-inhibitory factor to the culture medium. Although
tumor cells also express Oct4 at a high level in vitro, they do
not depend on the addition of any cytokines, such as leukemiainhibitory factor, to the culture system. The signal pathways
through which CSCLCs maintain Oct4 expression or/and their
multipotent state, as well as malignant proliferation potential,
have yet to be defined. Recently, HIF-2a has been shown to bind
to the Oct4 promoter and induce Oct4 expression in ES cells.
HIF-2a is an important primary regulator of hypoxic responses,
which shows strong tumor-promoting activity (42). Because
CSCLCs, as cancer-initiating cells, always occur in a ‘‘hypoxic’’
environment. It is therefore possible that Oct4 might also be
transcriptionally regulated by HIF-2a in CSCLCs. Oct4 has also

www.aacrjournals.org

been shown to function in a complex with Nanog and Sox2 in ES
cells (43, 44). More importantly, a new report has shown that
overexpression of Nanog can independently repress ES cell
differentiation. Nanog has also been shown to be expressed in
cancer (45). These fresh insights will be helpful in revealing the
mechanisms involved in the maintenance of CSCLC’s multipotent
state as well as malignant proliferation potential. This would
further the development of more effective cancer treatments
using stem cell knowledge. Much of this work is in progress in
our lab.
In summary, we show here for the first time that reduction of
Oct4 expression in CSCLCs induces apoptosis and the inhibition of
tumor growth partly through the Oct4/Tcl1/Akt1 pathway. The
strategy described here strongly suggests that specific targeted
inhibition of stem cell signaling pathways could be applied to
cancer therapy.
