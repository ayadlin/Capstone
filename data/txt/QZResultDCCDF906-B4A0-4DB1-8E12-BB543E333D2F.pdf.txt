ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is associated with increased expression of the pro-angiogenic
chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8), which induces tumor cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, and metastasis. Even though bortezomib (BZ) has shown remarkable
anti-tumor activity in hematological malignancies, it has been less effective in ovarian
cancer; however, the mechanisms are not understood. We have recently shown that
BZ unexpectedly induces the expression of IL-8 in ovarian cancer cells in vitro, by
IκB kinase (IKK)-dependent mechanism. Here, we tested the hypothesis that IKK
inhibition reduces the IL-8 production and increases BZ effectiveness in reducing
ovarian tumor growth in vivo. Our results demonstrate that the combination of BZ
and the IKK inhibitor Bay 117085 significantly reduces the growth of ovarian tumor
xenografts in nude mice when compared to either drug alone. Mice treated with
the BZ/Bay 117085 combination exhibit smallest tumors, and lowest levels of IL-8.
Furthermore, the reduced tumor growth in the combination group is associated
with decreased tumor levels of S536P-p65 NFκB and its decreased recruitment to
IL-8 promoter in tumor tissues. These data provide the first in vivo evidence that
combining BZ with IKK inhibitor is effective, and suggest that using IKK inhibitors
may increase BZ effectiveness in ovarian cancer treatment.

activity in multiple myeloma, cutaneous T cell lymphoma,
and other hematological malignancies, it has been less
effective in solid tumors, including ovarian cancer
[13–18]. However, the mechanisms are not fully
understood. Nevertheless, BZ has been considered in
combination with other therapies, especially the currently
used cisplatin, since BZ prevents the cisplatin-induced
degradation of cisplatin influx transporter, resulting in
enhanced cisplatin uptake and tumor cell killing [19, 20].
Thus, understanding the mechanisms responsible for the
resistance of ovarian carcinoma to BZ may lead to the
development of more effective combination therapies.
The initial rationale behind BZ development and
use was its inhibition of the inducible IκBα degradation
by 26S proteasome, resulting in the inhibition of
nuclear translocation of NFκB subunits and decreased
expression of NFκB-dependent anti-apoptotic genes in
multiple myeloma cells [21, 22]. However, studies from
our laboratory have shown that proteasome inhibition

INTRODUCTION
Each year, ovarian cancer is diagnosed in nearly
a quarter of a million women around the world, and is
responsible for approximately 140, 000 deaths. Due to
the asymptomatic nature of early disease, most women
present with stage III and IV ovarian cancer, for which
the standard of care remains surgery and platinumbased chemotherapy using cisplatin or carboplatin,
and taxane agents [1, 2]. However, since most ovarian
cancers relapse and become drug-resistant, the survival
rates remain low [3–5]. The advanced stages of ovarian
cancer are characterized by the increased expression of
the pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic chemokine IL-8
(CXCL8), which induces tumor cell survival, proliferation,
angiogenesis, and metastasis, and correlates with poor
prognosis [6–12].
Even though proteasome inhibition by bortezomib
(BZ; Velcade, PS-341) has shown remarkable anti-tumor

IKK inhibitor Bay 117085 suppresses BZ
induced IL-8 expression in ovarian cancer cells

also induces nuclear translocation of IκBα, which has
a promoter specific effect on the suppression of NFκBdependent genes [23, 24]. While most genes are inhibited
by the nuclear IκBα, the IL-8 expression is IκBα
independent [25]. Our recent in vitro studies have shown
that the proteasome inhibition by BZ actually increases the
IL-8 expression in cancer cells [26–28]. In ovarian cancer
cells in vitro, the BZ increased IL-8 expression is mediated
by IKKβ-dependent recruitment of S536-phosphorylated
p65 to IL-8 promoter [27], suggesting that inhibition of
IKK activity might increase BZ effectiveness in ovarian
cancer.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that IKK
inhibition increases BZ effectiveness in reducing
tumor growth in vivo, in ovarian cancer xenografts. We
demonstrate that combination of BZ and the IKK inhibitor
Bay 117085 significantly reduces ovarian tumor growth
in nude mice when compared to either drug alone. Our
results indicate that the underlying mechanisms involve
decreased tumor levels of S536P-p65 and its decreased
recruitment to IL-8 promoter in tumor tissue, resulting in
reduced tumor mRNA levels and plasma concentrations
of IL-8. These data suggest that combining BZ with IKK
inhibitor is effective and may demonstrate a clinical
benefit in the ovarian cancer treatment.

Since our data demonstrated that suppression of
IL-8 enhances the BZ pro-apoptotic effect (Figure 1),
and since studies by Mabuchi et al. [31, 32] indicated
that IKK inhibition by the soluble IKK inhibitor Bay
117085 induces apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells, we
hypothesized that IKK inhibition by Bay 117085 inhibits
the BZ-induced IL-8 expression in ovarian cancer cells.
To test this hypothesis, SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells
were pre-incubated 12 hours with 0, 5, and 20 μM Bay
117085 [31], before 24-hour incubation with 0.1 μM
BZ, which approximately corresponds to the clinically
used BZ concentrations [33], and IL-8 mRNA levels
and cytokine release were analyzed by RT-PCR and
ELISA, respectively. As shown in Figure 2, Bay 117085
significantly decreased the BZ-induced IL-8 mRNA
levels (Figure 2A) and cytokine release (Figure 2B) in
ovarian cancer SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells, suggesting
that IKK inhibition by Bay 117085 may enhance the BZ
effectiveness in ovarian cancer treatment.

Combination of BZ and Bay 117085 enhances BZ
effectiveness in reducing tumor growth in nude
mice implanted with ovarian cancer xenografts

RESULTS

To investigate whether Bay 117085 enhances BZ
effectiveness in ovarian cancer in vivo, we examined the
effect of BZ and Bay 117085 alone and in combination on
the ovarian tumor growth in nude mice. Female athymic
nude mice were implanted (s.c.) with SKOV3 cells. After
tumors (~70 mm3) developed, the mice were randomly
divided into four groups (n = 8) injected (i.p.) for 28 days
with the following: (a) vehicle control (PBS), (b) Bay
117085 (5 mg/kg) every other day (24), (c) BZ (1 mg/kg)
every third day (14), and (d) combination of Bay 117085
(5 mg/kg) and BZ (1 mg/kg). As evaluated by body
weight, the treatment regimen was well tolerated since the
mice did not lose any weight (Figure 3A).
After 28 days of therapy, Bay 117085 reduced the
average relative tumor volume by 40% compared to the
control group, whereas BZ reduced the average relative
tumor volume by 56% (Figure 3B). Remarkably, the
combination of Bay 117085 and BZ significantly decreased
the relative tumor volume compared with control animals
(79% tumor reduction, p < 0.001) or individual treatment
with Bay 117085 (61% tumor reduction, p < 0.001) or BZ
alone (51% tumor reduction, p < 0.001) by the final day of
treatment. The reduced tumor volume in mice treated with
the combination Bay 117085/BZ therapy corresponded to
the appearance of the tumors at the end of the treatment
(Figure 3C). In addition, the reduced tumor volume in
the combination group corresponded to the final average
tumor weight at the end of the experiment (Figure 3D).
The average final tumor weight in the combination group

Suppression of BZ-induced IL-8 expression
enhances BZ pro-apoptotic effect in ovarian
cancer cells
Since we have recently shown that BZ increases the in
vitro IL-8 expression in ovarian cancer cells [27], we wanted
to determine whether the BZ-induced IL-8 expression is
responsible for the decreased effectiveness of BZ in ovarian
cancer cells. To address this hypothesis, we suppressed the
IL-8 expression in BZ-treated ovarian cancer SKOV3 and
OVCAR3 cells by siRNA, and evaluated apoptosis by cell
death ELISA assay that quantifies the release of nucleosomes
into the cytoplasm [28]. As expected, BZ considerably
increased both IL-8 mRNA levels (Figure 1A) and IL-8
cytokine release (Figure 1B) in SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells
transfected with control siRNA. In cells transfected with
IL-8 specific siRNA, the IL-8 expression and release were
significantly decreased (Figures 1A and 1B).
BZ also increased apoptosis in SKOV3 and
OVCAR3 cells transfected with control siRNA (Figure
1C); this is in an agreement with previous studies
demonstrating that proteasome inhibition induces
apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells [29, 30]. Importantly, the
BZ-induced apoptosis was significantly increased in IL-8
siRNA transfected cells compared to cells transfected with
control siRNA (Figure 1C), indicating that suppression
of the BZ-induced IL-8 expression enhances the proapoptotic effect of BZ in ovarian cancer cells in vitro.

therapy resulted in the slowest tumor growth in vivo
(Figure 3), we reasoned that the combination BZ/Bay
117085 therapy might be associated with the reduced
IL-8 expression in implanted ovarian cancer xenografts.
To analyze the IL-8 expression in vivo, we measured IL-8
mRNA levels in tumor samples, and IL-8 cytokine release
in plasma samples obtained from mice at the end of the
treatment, by using quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA,
respectively. Since mice do not have a homolog of the
CXCL8/IL-8 gene, which is present in other species

mice, 59% compared to Bay 117085-treated mice (p <
0.001), and 56% compared to BZ-treated mice (p < 0.001)
(Figure 3D). These data indicate that combining the IKK
inhibitor Bay 117085 and the proteasome inhibitor BZ has
significant anti-tumor effectiveness in vivo.

Combination of BZ and Bay 117085 decreases
recruitment of S536-p65 to IL-8 promoter in
ovarian cancer xenografts

Interestingly, while Bay 117085 or BZ alone did
not have a significant effect on the IL-8 mRNA levels in
tumors, combination of Bay 117085 and BZ significantly
decreased the IL-8 mRNA levels in ovarian tumor
xenografts (Figure 4A). The IL-8 mRNA levels analyzed
in the tumor tissues in the combination group were only
44% compared to the control untreated group (Figure 4A).
Correspondingly, the Bay 117085/ BZ combination
therapy significantly reduced the IL-8 plasma levels,
while either drug alone did not inhibit the IL-8 release
(Figure 4B). Compared to mice in the control group, the
IL-8 plasma levels in the BZ/Bay 117085 combination
group were 50% lower (Figure 4B).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In vitro, the IL-8 transcription is regulated by
IκBα-independent, promoter specific recruitment
of p65 NFκB phosphorylated by IKK at S536
[27, 35, 36]. Thus, we wanted to determine whether
the reduced IL-8 expression and tumor growth in the
combination group are associated with decreased levels
of S536-phosphorylated p65 and its recruitment to the
endogenous IL-8 promoter in ovarian cancer xenografts.

DISCUSSION

analyzed p65, S536P-p65, p50, IκBα, and actin protein
levels in whole cell extracts prepared from tumor tissues
by immunoblotting.
As shown in Figures 5A and 5B, proteasome
inhibition by BZ increased the protein levels of p65
in tumor tissues. This is consistent with previous
studies demonstrating that p65 undergoes proteasomal
degradation [37–39]. In contrast to p65, p50 levels were
not substantially changed between the four groups,
indicating that p50 is not subjected to proteasomal
degradation in vivo. Both Bay 117085 and BZ increased
the tumor levels of IκBα, which was highest in the
combination group; this is consistent with the welldocumented IKK-dependent proteasomal degradation of
IκBα [40, 41]. The levels of S536-p65 were highest in the
control group, and as expected, S536 p65 phosphorylation
was significantly reduced in mice treated with the IKK
inhibitor Bay 117085 (Figures 5A, 5B).
To determine whether the decreased expression
of IL-8 in the combination group is associated with
the decreased promoter occupancy of S536P-p65 in
tumor tissues, we analyzed S536P-p65 recruitment
to the endogenous IL-8 promoter by chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP). To this end, tumor tissues
were homogenized, proteins and DNA were crosslinked with formaldehyde, and chromatin was sheared
by sonication. The recruitment of p65, S536P-p65, and
p50 to IL-8 promoter in tumor xenografts was measured
by ChIP and quantified by real time PCR. As shown in
Figure 5C, p65 and p50 were not substantially recruited
to the IL-8 promoter, and their promoter occupancy
was not significantly affected by Bay 117085 or BZ. In
contrast, S536P-p65 was considerably recruited to the
IL-8 promoter in tumor tissues, and its recruitment was
significantly decreased in the combination group.

The key finding of this study is that combination
of BZ and the IKK inhibitor Bay 117085 significantly
reduces tumor growth of ovarian cancer xenografts in
nude mice when compared to either drug alone. After four
weeks of therapy, the combination of Bay 117085 and BZ
inhibited the average tumor volume by 61% compared
with Bay 117085 alone, and by 51% compared with BZ
alone. The average tumor weight in the combination group
was decreased by 59% compared to Bay 117085 alone, and
by 56% compared to BZ alone. The reduced tumor growth
in mice treated with the BZ/Bay 117085 combination
was associated with decreased tumor IL-8 mRNA levels
and decreased IL-8 concentration in plasma samples.
Furthermore, the reduced tumor growth in the combination
group was associated with decreased tumor levels of
S536P-p65 NFκB, and with the decreased recruitment of
S536P-p65 to IL-8 promoter in tumor tissues. These data
provide the first in vivo evidence that combining BZ with
IKK inhibitor is effective and may demonstrate a clinical
benefit in the ovarian cancer treatment.
Despite the limited effectiveness of BZ as a single
agent in the treatment of ovarian carcinoma and other
solid tumors, BZ has been considered in combination
with cisplatin and other platinum drugs [16–18], since it
prevents the proteasomal degradation of cisplatin influx
transporter, resulting in increased cisplatin uptake and
tumor cell killing [19, 20]. The original rationale behind
BZ development and use in multiple myeloma was the
inhibition of NFκB-dependent transcription of antiapoptotic genes, by blocking the inducible proteasomal
degradation of IκBα and nuclear translocation of NFκB
subunits [21, 22]. However, later studies demonstrated
that in unstimulated cells, proteasome inhibition actually

induces NFκB activity by increasing stability and activity
of IKK [27, 42]. Even though in ovarian cancer cells,
proteasome inhibition reduces expression of NFκBdependent anti-apoptotic genes and induces apoptosis
[29, 30], it also induces IKK-dependent IL-8 expression
[27]. Since suppression of the BZ-induced IL-8 expression
increases the BZ pro-apoptotic effect in ovarian cancer
cells, and since IL-8 levels correlate with ovarian cancer
progression [9–12], these data suggest that the BZ-induced
IL-8 expression might represent one of the mechanisms
responsible for the decreased effectiveness of BZ in
ovarian cancer treatment.
We have recently shown that the mechanisms that
regulate the IL-8 expression in ovarian cancer cells in
vitro, involve IKKβ-dependent S536 phosphorylation
of p65, which is specifically recruited to the IL-8
promoter, resulting in increased IL-8 transcription [27].
Interestingly however, while BZ substantially increases
the IL-8 expression in ovarian cancer cells in vitro [27],
BZ alone has only an insignificant effect on the IL-8
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mRNA tumor levels and IL-8 plasma concentrations
in nude mice. Furthermore, in contrast to inhibiting the
BZ-induced IL-8 expression in vitro, Bay 117085 alone
somewhat increases the IL-8 mRNA tumor levels and
IL-8 plasma concentrations in vivo. Even though the
precise mechanisms are unclear at present, they likely
involve additional side effects of BZ and Bay 117085
on other signaling molecules and pathways. In this
context, previous in vitro studies have shown that in
addition to inhibiting the IKK activity, Bay 117085 also
has an NFκB-independent effect, and activates mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPK), extracellular signalregulated kinases ERK1/2 and p38 kinase in human
chondrocytes and monocytic cells, respectively [43, 44].
Since in vitro studies have shown that the IL-8 expression
in ovarian cancer cells is regulated by p38 and ERK1/2
kinases [45–47], it seems plausible that Bay 117085, as
a single agent, increases the IL-8 expression in mice by
activating p38 and/or ERK1/2. Intriguingly, however,
combination of BZ with Bay 117085 has a synergistic
26353

MATERIALS AND METHODS

effect on the IL-8 expression in mice, and results in a
significantly reduced ovarian tumor growth compared
to either drug alone. Even though the regulation of
IL-8 expression in vivo is complex, and more studies
are warranted, one possible mechanism may consist of
BZ inhibition of the Bay 117085-induced p38 and/or
ERK1/2 pathways, since recent studies have indicated
that proteasome inhibition by BZ suppresses MAPK
signaling [48, 49]. In this model, an individual treatment
with BZ or with Bay 117085 has only a modest effect
on reducing ovarian tumor growth in mice since it does
not significantly inhibit the IL-8 expression. However,
combination of BZ and Bay 117085 maximizes the
potential of both drugs to inhibit the IL-8 expression and
reduce ovarian tumor growth in vivo. In ovarian cancer
cells in vitro, the IL-8 expression is regulated by IKKβmediated recruitment of S536P-p65 NFκB to the IL-8
promoter [27]. Since the decreased expression of IL-8
in mice treated with the BZ/Bay 117085 combination
is associated with the reduced S536 phosphorylation of
p65 and its decreased recruitment to the IL-8 promoter
in tumor tissues, these results suggest that the IL-8
expression in vivo is also regulated by S536P-p65.
High expression of IL-8 and IKKβ in ovarian
cancer tissues has been related to the aggressive nature
of this disease, and to the poor outcome [9–12, 50–52].
Interestingly, epidemiological studies have indicated that
the regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), including aspirin and diclofenac, is associated
with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer [53–56]. In addition,
recent studies have shown that NSAIDs reduce ovarian
tumor growth in mice [57, 58]. Even though one of the
main mechanisms of action of NSAIDs is the inhibition
of cyclooxygenase activity, they also inhibit the IKK
activity, particularly the activity of IKKβ [59, 60].
Although as single agents, IKK inhibitors have failed to
exhibit a strong anticancer effect in ovarian cancer, they
have been considered in combination with chemotherapy,
particularly with cisplatin and paclitaxel, since they inhibit
the cisplatin- and paclitaxel-induced NFκB activity in
ovarian cancer cells [31, 61, 62].
Collectively, our data demonstrate that combining
the proteasome inhibitor BZ with the IKK inhibitor Bay
117085 significantly reduces ovarian tumor growth in
nude mice when compared to either drug alone. Even
though additional mechanisms are likely to be involved,
our results indicate that the reduced tumor growth is
associated with the IKK-dependent decreased S536
phosphorylation of p65 and its decreased recruitment to
IL-8 promoter, resulting in reduced IL-8 transcription. To
our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that
IKK inhibition increases BZ effectiveness in reducing
ovarian tumor growth in vivo, and suggesting that future
studies and clinical trials should examine the effect of IKK
inhibitors on increasing the BZ effectiveness in ovarian
cancer treatment.

All animal procedures were carried out in
accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the NIH,
26354

and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of St. John’s University. Five-week-old
female athymic nude mice (Taconic Farms, NY, USA)
were used for tumor xenograft experiments. Mice were
maintained on an alternating 12 hours light/dark cycle
with ad libitum water and rodent chow as described
[63, 64]. Mice were subcutaneously (s.c.) injected in the
right flanks with 5 × 106 of SKOV3 cells in 200 μl of
serum free RPMI media. Once the average tumor size
reached about 70 mm3, mice were randomly divided
into four groups (n = 8). The control group received
the control vehicle (PBS) injected intra-peritoneally
(i.p) every other day for four consecutive weeks. The
“IKK inhibitor” group received Bay 117085 (5 mg/kg)
prepared in PBS, injected i.p. every other day. The “BZ”
group received BZ (1 mg/kg) prepared in PBS, injected
i.p. every third day. The “combination” group received
Bay 117085 every other day, and BZ every third day.
Mice were weighed, and tumor volume was monitored
by caliper measurement every other day. Tumor volumes
were calculated using the following formula: Volume =
length × width2 × 0.5.
At the endpoint, mice were anesthetized using
isoflurane inhalant gas and approximately 1 ml of blood
was collected from each mouse by cardiac puncture. The
blood samples were centrifuged at room temperature in
heparinized tubes to prepare plasma samples, which were
stored at −80°C for future IL-8 analysis. Immediately
after the blood collection, mice were euthanized using
carbon dioxide and tumors were excised, measured,
weighed, and collected. Each tumor was cut into two
parts; one part was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored in -80°C for future protein extraction and
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The other
half was stored in RNAlater solution for total RNA
extraction.

as template on a Bio-Rad MyIQ Single Color Real-Time
PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The primers used for
quantification of IL-8 and actin mRNA were purchased
from SA Biosciences (Frederick, MD, USA).

Western analysis
Tumor tissues were rinsed with PBS containing 1
mM PMSF and 1% (v/v) anti-protease cocktail (P8340,
Sigma), and homogenized in a lysis buffer containing
0.5M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 50% glycerol, 10% SDS and 1%
(w/v) bromophenol blue, using dounce homogenizer. The
homogenized tissues were immediately boiled (7 min)
and centrifuged (5 min, 5, 000 g). The supernatants were
collected and stored at –80°C. The denatured proteins
were separated on 12% SDS gels, and analyzed by
immunoblotting as described [26–28].

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
Tumor tissues were homogenized in PBS buffer
containing 1% (v/v) anti-protease cocktail (P8340,
Sigma) and 1 mM PMSF by using dounce homogenizer.
Proteins and DNA were cross-linked by formaldehyde,
and cells were washed and sonicated as described [26–
28]. The lysates were centrifuged (15, 000 g, 10 min,
4°C), and the supernatant extracts were diluted with
ChIP dilution buffer and pre-cleared with Protein A/G
Agarose (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 2 hours at 4°C.
Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4°C,
with p65, S536P-p65, or p50 antibodies. Following
immunoprecipitation, the samples were incubated
with Protein A/G Agarose (1 h, 4°C), and the immune
complexes were collected by centrifugation (150 g, 5
min, 4°C), washed, and extracted with 1% SDS–0.1 M
NaHCO3. After reversing the cross-linking, proteins
were digested with proteinase K, and the samples
were extracted with phenol/chloroform, followed
by precipitation with ethanol. The pellets were resuspended in nuclease-free water and subjected to real
time PCR. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed
by real-time PCR (25 μl reaction mixture) using the
iQ SYBR Green Supermix and the Bio-Rad MyIQ
Single Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad). Each immunoprecipitation was performed at
least three times using different chromatin samples,
and the occupancy was calculated by using the human
IGX1A negative control primers (SA Biosciences,
Frederick, MD, USA), which detect specific genomic
ORF-free DNA sequence that does not contain binding
site for any known transcription factors. The results
were calculated as fold difference in occupancy of the
particular protein at the particular locus in comparison
with the IGX1A locus.
The IL-8 primers used for real time PCR were
5′-GGGCCATCAGTTGCAAATC-3′(forward),
and
5′-GCTTGTGTGCTCTGCTGTCTC-3′(reverse).

ELISA
IL-8 release was measured in cell culture
supernatants and mice plasma samples by commercially
available IL-8 ELISA kit (R&D, Minneapolis, MN, USA)
as described [27].

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was evaluated using a cell death detection
ELISA kit that quantifies the release of nucleosomes into
the cytoplasm (Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS, Roche,
Indianapolis, IN, USA) as described [28].

Real time RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated by using RNeasy mini-kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The iScript one-step RTPCR kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
was used as a supermix and 20 ng/μl of RNA was used
