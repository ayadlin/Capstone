IL-8 Signaling Plays a Critical Role in the Epithelial–
Mesenchymal Transition of Human Carcinoma Cells
Romaine I. Fernando, Marianne D. Castillo, Mary Litzinger, Duane H. Hamilton, and Claudia Palena

Abstract
The switch of tumor cells from an epithelial to a mesenchymal-like phenotype [designated as epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT)] is known to induce tumor cell motility and invasiveness, therefore promoting
metastasis of solid carcinomas. Although multiple studies have focused on elucidating the signaling events that
initiate this phenotypic switch, there has been so far no characterization of the pattern of soluble mediators
released by tumor cells undergoing EMT, and the potential impact that this phenotypic switch could have on the
remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Here we show that induction of EMT in human carcinoma cells via
overexpression of the transcription factor Brachyury is associated with enhanced secretion of multiple cytokines,
chemokines, and angiogenic factors and, in particular, with the induction of the IL-8/IL-8R axis. Our results also
indicate the essential role of interleukin 8 (IL-8) signaling for the acquisition and/or maintenance of the
mesenchymal and invasive features of Brachyury-overexpressing tumor cells and show that IL-8 secreted by
tumor cells undergoing EMT could potentiate tumor progression by inducing adjacent epithelial tumor cells into
EMT. Altogether, our results emphasize the potential role of EMT in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment via secretion of multiple soluble mediators and suggest that IL-8 signaling blockade may provide a
means of targeting mesenchymal-like, invasive tumor cells. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5296–306. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Multiple cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors play a
critical role as mediators of paracrine signals between the
tumor and various components of the tumor microenvironment, which will ultimately lead to tumor growth, survival,
and progression (1–3). These soluble mediators could be
secreted either by the tumor cells themselves or by any of
the various cellular components of the tumor microenvironment, including cancer-associated fibroblasts, immune cells,
and endothelial cells, among others (4, 5). In particular, tumorderived soluble factors have been shown to function in a
paracrine fashion to reprogram the normal stroma to a
tumorigenic stroma (6), as well as to work in an autocrine
way promoting tumor growth, survival, and acquisition of
metastatic potential (7). Interleukin 8 (IL-8, CXCL8), a proinflammatory CXC chemokine, constitutes an example of a
soluble mediator released by tumor cells that simultaneously

function in an autocrine and paracrine mode within the tumor
microenvironment. In melanoma, tumor-derived IL-8 has
been shown to promote tumor cell proliferation, survival,
and migration via its autocrine activity, while inducing an
angiogenic response in endothelial cells and the recruitment
of neutrophils to the tumor site via its paracrine activity (8, 9).
In recent years, the importance of an epithelial–mesenchymal phenotypic switch of tumor cells [epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (EMT)] has been shown during the progression of
carcinomas (10, 11). The role of multiple growth factors, cytokines, and components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in
inducing EMT in epithelial tumor cells has been well documented and, for example, TGF-b, fibroblast growth factor
(FGF), and TNF-a have all been implicated in the induction
of EMT (10, 12–14). To date, however, there has been no
comprehensive analysis of the pattern of soluble factors
released by tumor cells undergoing a switch from an epithelial
to a mesenchymal-like phenotype along the course of carcinoma progression. The characterization of the "secretory
phenotype" of tumor cells undergoing EMT might help to
understand the potential impact that this phenotypic switch
could have on the remodeling of the tumor microenvironment,
therefore favoring tumor progression.
In a previous study, we have shown the role of the T-box
transcription factor Brachyury in the induction of EMT and
metastatic potential in various human cancer cell lines (15).
We have also shown that Brachyury mRNA expression is
predominant among high stage lung tumor tissues, with lower
expression among lung tumors of stage I (15). Here we have
investigated whether Brachyury-induced EMT drives the
secretion of a distinctive set of soluble factors by the tumor

IL-8 Signaling in Brachyury-Induced Tumor Progression

cells, and the potential role that these secreted mediators
could play in the context of tumor progression. Our results
have shown that overexpression of Brachyury in epithelial
tumor cells is associated with enhanced secretion of multiple
cytokines, chemokines, and angiogenic factors. In particular,
we have shown that the phenotypic switch of epithelial tumor
cells in response to Brachyury is accompanied by the induction of the IL-8/IL-8R axis which, in turn, seems to be essential
for the acquisition and/or maintenance of the mesenchymal
and invasive features of Brachyury-overexpressing tumor cells.
Moreover, our results also show that Brachyury-induced
tumor-secreted factors promote EMT in epithelial tumor cells,
an effect that is, at least in part, mediated by IL-8.
Altogether, our results emphasize the potential role of EMT
in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment via secretion of multiple soluble mediators and suggest that IL-8
signaling blockade may provide a means of targeting
mesenchymal-like, invasive tumor cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
The human carcinoma cell lines used in this study, luminal
breast MCF7, T47D, and BT474; basal breast MDA-MB-231
and MDA-MB-436; pancreatic PANC-1, and the lung cancer
cell line H460 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection and propagated in RPMI 1640 medium with 2
mmol/L glutamine, 1 solution of penicillin/streptomycin
(Mediatech, Inc.) and 10% FBS (Gibco; Invitrogen). MCF7
and PANC-1 cells were stably transfected with a control
pcDNA4/TO or a vector encoding for the full-length human
Brachyury protein (pBrachyury); the lung H460 and the breast
MDA-MB-436 tumor cells were stably transfected with a
control or a short hairpin RNA specific for Brachyury, as
previously described (15).
Cytokine and chemokine array
The level of secreted cytokines and chemokines was analyzed in the supernatants of MCF7 and PANC-1 tumor cell
pairs by using a protein cytokine array for 79 human cytokines
(RayBio Human G Series Array V; RayBiotech, Inc.). Cells were
plated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Inc.) for
24 hours; supernatants were collected and analyzed following
the manufacturer's recommendations. Cytokine and chemokine levels in each membrane were normalized by comparison
to the intensity of positive control spots.
Treatment of tumor cells with culture supernatants or
IL-8
Culture supernatants [designated here as conditioned
media (CM)] from MCF7–pcDNA and MCF7–pBrachyury
cultures were collected as described above and subsequently
used for the treatment of adherent tumor cells for 72 hours.
For IL-8 receptor blocking studies, antibodies specific for the
IL-8RA (ab8041; Abcam), IL-8RB (ab10401; Abcam), or control
IgG (AbD Serotec) were added to the cultures at a final
concentration of 1 mg/mL and incubated for 72 hours. For
treatment with IL-8, adherent tumor cells were cultured in the

www.aacrjournals.org

presence of recombinant IL-8 (Peprotech) at the indicated
concentrations for 72 hours in serum-free medium.
RNA interference
ON-TARGET plus SMART pool siRNA for Brachyury and a
nontargeting control siRNA (Dharmacon) were used following
the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, tumor cells were incubated with 100 nmol/L of each siRNA prepared in DharmaFECT
reagent in antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 medium for 48 hours.
Real-time PCR
Real-time PCR was conducted as previously described (15)
by using 10 ng of cDNA and the following TaqMan gene
expression assays (Applied Biosystems): Brachyury
(Hs00610080), Snail (Hs00195591), Slug (Hs00161904), Fibronectin (Hs00415006), human IL-8 (Hs01567913), human IL-8RA
(Hs00174146), human IL-8RB (Hs01011557), and GAPDH
(4326317E). Mean Ct values for target genes were normalized
to mean Ct values for the endogenous control glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH; DCt ¼ Ct(GAPDH) 
Ct(target gene)]. The ratio of mRNA expression of target gene
versus GAPDH was defined as 2(DCt).
IL-8 ELISA
IL-8 in 100 mL of serum-free supernatants from tumor cell
pairs was measured by using a human IL-8 ELISA Kit (RayBiotech, Inc.), as directed by the manufacturer.
Promoter assay
Tumor cells were transfected with 50 ng of a Brachyury
promoter or a control promoter luciferase vector (SwitchGear
Genomics) by using Fugene-6 (Roche), and subsequently treated with recombinant IL-8 in triplicate wells. Forty-eight hours
later, tumor cells were incubated with 100 mL of ONE-Glo
Luciferase substrate (Promega) and Luciferase activity was
measured by using a 1450 Betaplate reader (Perkin-Elmer).
Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescent analysis of tumor cells cultured on
glass cover slips was done as previously described (15). For
inhibition of IL-8 signaling, cells were cultured for 72 hours in
medium containing 1 mg/mL of blocking antibodies specific
for the IL-8 receptors or a neutralizing IL-8 antibody (clone
6217; R&D Systems).
Migration and invasion assays
Invasion assay was done as previously described (15). For
IL-8 receptor blocking experiments, cells were incubated
with 1 mg/mL of anti–IL-8RA, anti–IL-8RB, or control IgG for
1 hour at 37 C. Antibody was washed off and tumor cells
were resuspended in serum-free RPMI-1640 medium and
subsequently analyzed for invasiveness. The assay duration
for each tumor cell line was as follows: 48 hours for MCF7, 24
hours for MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436. For IL-8 signaling
blockade in the presence of culture supernatant (CM), cells
were incubated for 72 hours with MCF7–pBrachyury CM in
the presence of antibodies and subsequently analyzed for
invasiveness.

Results

Brachyury overexpression induces expression of IL-8
and its cognate receptors
As IL-8 is a chemokine with a proven role in tumor progression (16), here we have further evaluated the levels of secreted
IL-8 protein by ELISA assay and IL-8 mRNA in various tumor
pairs (low vs. high Brachyury). As shown in Figure 2A, a 4- and a
5-fold increase in the levels of secreted IL-8 were observed in
the supernatants of Brachyury-overexpressing MCF7 and
PANC-1 cells, respectively, compared with the control cells.
Moreover, stable inhibition of Brachyury expression in the
basal breast MDA-MB-436 and the lung H460 cancer cell lines
that exhibit a mesenchymal phenotype and express higher
levels of Brachyury resulted in a 8- and 2-fold inhibition of IL-8
secretion, respectively (Fig. 2A). These changes were also
observed at the transcriptional level, as the expression of IL8 mRNA was markedly enhanced in Brachyury-overexpressing
MCF7 and PANC-1 cells, or significantly reduced in MDA-MB436 and H460 carcinoma cells in response to Brachyury inhibition (Fig. 2B), thus reinforcing the positive correlation between
Brachyury and IL-8 expression in human tumor cells.

Secretory phenotype of epithelial tumor cells
undergoing Brachyury-induced EMT
To investigate whether overexpression of Brachyury could
modulate the pattern of soluble mediators secreted by epithelial tumor cells, we analyzed by using protein arrays the levels
of multiple cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors
released by the human breast MCF7 and pancreatic PANC1 carcinoma cells that were transfected with an empty vector
(pcDNA) versus a vector encoding for human Brachyury
(pBrachyury; Fig. 1A and B). Serum-free CM was obtained
from cell-normalized cultures of each cell line; as shown in
Figure 1C and D, overexpression of Brachyury in both tumor
cell lines resulted in enhanced secretion of multiple soluble
factors. In particular, the levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG,
TNFRSF11B), IL-8, regulated upon activation normal T-cell
expressed and secreted (RANTES, CCL5), growth-regulated
oncogene (GRO), IL-6, and MIP-1d (CCL15) were significantly
increased in the supernatants from MCF7–pBrachyury versus
control cells. In PANC-1 cells, overexpression of Brachyury
resulted in enhanced secretion of IL-8, insulin-like growth

IL-8R-beta (IL-8RB, CXCR2; ref. 17). To determine whether
Brachyury may also have an impact on the expression of the IL8 receptors, we used real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RTPCR) to evaluate IL-8RA and IL-8RB mRNA levels in the MCF7,
PANC-1, and H460 tumor cell pairs (low vs. high Brachyury
expression). A 3-fold increase in the expression of IL-8RA and
no change in the levels of IL-8RB were observed in MCF7–
pBrachyury cells, compared with the control cells (Fig. 2C).
Unlike with the MCF7 cells, overexpression of Brachyury in
PANC-1 cells induced the expression of IL-8RB by several fold
(Fig. 2C) and had no effect on the expression of IL-8RA, which
remained undetectable in the PANC-1 cells regardless of the
status of Brachyury expression. Similarly, the lung carcinoma
line H460 showed expression of IL-8RB that was significantly
decreased after Brachyury knockdown (Fig. 2C), whereas IL8RA was undetectable regardless of the expression of Brachy-

ury. MDA-MB-436 cells showed no expression of mRNA encoding for both receptors; however, Western blot analysis revealed
expression of IL-8RB protein that was significantly reduced in
cells stably inhibited for the expression of Brachyury (Fig. 2D).
Altogether, these results indicated that the Brachyury-induced
phenotypic switch in epithelial tumor cells is accompanied by
the induction of the IL-8/IL-8R axis. As the analysis of the
promoter region of these genes showed no putative Brachyury
binding sites, the upregulation of IL-8 and IL-8R expression
might be indirect and not a consequence of direct transcriptional regulation by Brachyury.

essential for EMT
We next determined whether the IL-8/IL-8R axis has any
role in the acquisition of a metastatic phenotype as a result of

Brachyury overexpression. To this end, we assessed the
expression of epithelial E-cadherin and mesenchymal fibronectin in MCF7–pBrachyury cells that were previously treated
with a control IgG or a blocking antibody directed against
IL-8RA or IL-8RB. As shown in Figure 3A, blockade of IL-8
receptors did not affect E-cadherin expression but markedly
reduced fibronectin expression and the invasiveness of
MCF7–pBrachyury cells. The breast cancer cell lines MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-436, classified as basal B type, have
been previously shown to exhibit mesenchymal and invasive
characteristics (18, 19). Both cell lines were selected to evaluate the role of the IL-8/IL-8R axis on tumor cells that
naturally exhibit a mesenchymal phenotype. Blockade of IL8 signaling resulted in a significant reduction of fibronectin
expression at the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3B), a reduction on the expression of Brachyury mRNA in both cell lines
(Fig. 3C) and, more importantly, a marked reduction of the
invasive capacity of both tumor cell lines (Fig. 3D). Therefore,
a functional IL-8/IL-8R axis seems to be essential for the
acquisition and/or maintenance of the mesenchymal and
invasive features of breast cancer tumor cells.
Brachyury-induced tumor-secreted factors promote
EMT in breast cancer cells
Tumor cells undergoing EMT might constitute a small
fraction of the total primary tumor mass. We have hypothesized that, via secretion of multiple soluble factors, a few
EMT-induced tumor cells could have a profound impact on
the phenotype of adjacent cells, including other epithelial
tumor cells that did not undergo the phenotypic switch, as
well as the various components of the tumor stroma. To test
this hypothesis, we incubated parental MCF7 and T47D
luminal breast cancer cells in the presence of CM derived
from MCF7–pBrachyury versus MCF7–pcDNA cells. Incubation of both tumor cells in the presence of MCF7–pBrachyury CM resulted in a significant decrease of epithelial
E-cadherin and enhancement of the mesenchymal protein
fibronectin (Fig. 4A), changes that are characteristic of a
switch from an epithelial to a mesenchymal-like phenotype
(i.e., EMT). Interestingly, similar treatment of MDA-MB-231
cells that normally exhibit a mesenchymal phenotype further
enhanced their expression of fibronectin (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, the expression of mRNA encoding for the EMT transcriptional regulators Brachyury, Snail, and Slug was
significantly enhanced in all 3 tumor cell lines treated with
culture supernatants obtained from MCF7–pBrachyury versus MCF7–pcDNA cells (Fig. 4B).
IL-8 induces a mesenchymal-like phenotype in breast
cancer cells
To investigate whether IL-8 is critical for the EMT-inducing
activity of culture supernatants from MCF7–pBrachyury cells,
parental MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with
MCF7–pBrachyury CM in the presence of IL-8R blocking
antibodies or control IgG, and subsequently tested for their
invasive properties in vitro. Incubation in the presence of
conditioned medium obtained from MCF7–pBrachyury versus
MCF7–pcDNA cultures significantly increased the ability of

5300

Cancer Res; 71(15) August 1, 2011

parental MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells to invade the extracellular matrix in vitro (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, tumor invasiveness observed in both cell lines treated with MCF7–
pBrachyury supernatants was significantly inhibited by IL-8
signaling blockade, thus suggesting that IL-8 is, at least in part,
responsible for the EMT-promoting activity of Brachyuryinduced secreted factors (Fig. 5B and C).
We further evaluated the role of IL-8 in the induction of
tumor EMT by directly exposing MCF7, T47D, and MDA-MB231 cells to purified, recombinant human IL-8. As shown in
Figure 6A, MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cells treated with IL8 showed a significant reduction of E-cadherin expression, an
increase of fibronectin expression, and upregulation of Brachyury expression (Fig. 6B). MDA-MB-231 showed enhanced
expression of fibronectin (Fig. 6A) and simultaneous upregulation of Brachyury as a result of IL-8 treatment (Fig. 6B). To
further evaluate the mechanism by which IL-8 might induce
the expression of Brachyury, MCF7 cells were transiently
transfected with a reporter vector encoding for the luciferase
gene under the control of the Brachyury promoter versus a
control promoter. Treatment of MCF7 cells with recombinant
IL-8 resulted in approximately a 4-fold increase in luciferase
activity, therefore indicating that IL-8 treatment of tumor cells
results in the enhanced transcriptional activity of the Brachyury promoter in MCF7 cells (Fig. 6C).
Brachyury is essential for the induction of invasiveness
and fibronectin expression mediated by IL-8
Treatment of MCF7 cells with recombinant IL-8 significantly improved their ability to invade the extracellular matrix
in vitro (Fig. 7A). IL-8 was also able to enhance the invasive
abilities of the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 tumor cells,
which naturally exhibit higher invasive capacity than MCF7
cells (Fig. 7A). To investigate whether Brachyury upregulation
in response to IL-8 treatment might be essential for the
induction of tumor invasiveness, MDA-MB-436 cells were
transiently transfected with a control siRNA or a siRNA
specific for Brachyury. Tumor cells transfected with control
siRNA showed a marked induction of invasiveness in response
to IL-8 treatment, whereas cells inhibited for Brachyury
expression were unable to invade in response to IL-8
(Fig. 7B). A similar approach was used with MCF7 and
BT474 cells. Both tumor cell lines upregulated fibronectin
following IL-8 treatment when transfected with control siRNA
but not with Brachyury siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S1). These
results thus indicated that Brachyury upregulation is essential
for the IL-8–mediated epithelial–mesenchymal switch of
tumor cells, including the acquisition of mesenchymal fibronectin and enhanced tumor invasiveness.

Discussion
Multiple studies have indicated a critical role of the epithelial–mesenchymal phenotypic switch of tumor cells (EMT)
during cancer progression by showing a positive correlation
between poor prognosis or advanced disease and the activation of an EMT program in various types of human carcinomas (15, 20–22). In recent years, it is becoming clear that

Figure 4. Brachyury-induced tumor-secreted factors mediate EMT in human breast tumor cells. A, immunofluorescent analysis of E-cadherin and
fibronectin in tumor cells that were incubated with CM obtained from cultures of MCF7–pcDNA or MCF7–pBrachyury cells. B, real-time RT-PCR analysis

The T-box transcription factor Brachyury, a molecule highly
expressed in a variety of human tumors with low or undetectable expression among most human normal tissues, has
been shown to induce EMT in various human tumor cells (15,
24). Here we have further shown that the transition of human
tumor cells from an epithelial to a mesenchymal-like phenotype as a result of Brachyury overexpression is associated with
the secretion of multiple cytokines, chemokines, and growth
factors, including IL-8, IL-6, GRO, RANTES, MIP-1d, GM-CSF,
and the angiogenic factors VEGF, angiogenin, and PlGF. Many
of these factors have been previously associated with tumor
progression in various types of carcinomas (25–28).
Tumor cells undergoing a switch from an epithelial to a
mesenchymal-like phenotype may constitute only a small
fraction of the total primary tumor mass. By secreting a
variety of soluble factors, we hypothesized that a few
mesenchymal-like tumor cells might markedly influence other
cellular components of the tumor stroma as well as other
tumor cells that remained in the epithelial state. In this study,
we have been able to show that various breast cancer cell lines
incubated with culture supernatants from MCF7–pBrachyury,
but not MCF7–pcDNA control cells, were induced to undergo
a phenotypic switch characterized by the overexpression of
fibronectin, induction of tumor cell invasiveness, and upregulation of mRNA encoding for the EMT transcriptional
regulators Brachyury, Snail, and Slug. Therefore, in the context
of a tumor, the soluble factors secreted by a few tumor cells
undergoing Brachyury-mediated EMT could potentially func-

tion in a paracrine mode to induce adjacent epithelial tumor
cells to undergo the phenotypic switch and to acquire metastatic potential.
In particular, expression of the chemokine IL-8 in cancer
has been associated with tumor growth and survival,
increased tumor cell migration and invasion, and increased
neovascularization (29–31). Elevated IL-8 serum levels have
been reported in patients with pancreatic, breast, and prostate
cancer, and a positive correlation has been established
between IL-8 serum levels, advanced disease, and diminished
survival in breast cancer patients (32–36). The cellular origin
of the elevated IL-8 levels, however, remains unclear. The
positive association observed in our studies between Brachyury expression and the expression of IL-8 would suggest that
tumor cells undergoing Brachyury-mediated EMT could be
one potential source of IL-8 found in the tumor environment
of progressive tumors. Experiments with blocking antibodies
showed that IL-8 is at least one of the factors responsible for
the EMT-promoting properties of MCF7–pBrachyury-derived
culture supernatants. Moreover, the EMT-promoting activity
of IL-8 was also shown here by directly incubating various
breast cancer cell lines with recombinant IL-8, which resulted
in upregulated expression of Brachyury, enhanced mesenchymal phenotype, and improved tumor invasiveness. Previous
studies have shown that IL-8 is a transcriptional target of
Ras signaling and that Ras-induced IL-8 expression is critical
for the initiation of tumor-associated inflammation and
neovascularization during Ras oncogene-dependent tumor

progression (37). During the development of vertebrate mesoderm, Ras signaling plays an essential role in the FGF-induced
Brachyury expression (38). A preliminary analysis of several
human lung carcinoma cell lines showed no obvious correlation between the levels of Brachyury mRNA and the mutational status of Ras. However, given the relevant role of Ras
signaling during the embryonic induction of Brachyury,
further experiments aimed at elucidating a potential link
between Ras activation and Brachyury expression in epithelial
tumor cells are planned.

www.aacrjournals.org

In addition to the induction of IL-8 expression and secretion, our studies also show that the levels of IL-8R are
enhanced in tumor cells undergoing EMT in response to
Brachyury. This observation prompted us to determine
whether Brachyury-induced IL-8 and IL-8 receptors could
also play a role in the acquisition and/or maintenance of a
mesenchymal-like phenotype in tumor cells. Antibody blocking experiments indicated that the IL-8/IL-8R axis, functioning in autocrine positive loop, is critical to promote the
acquisition and/or maintenance of the metastatic phenotype
in various breast tumor cell lines. In addition, reinforcing the
idea of a positive feedback loop between Brachyury and IL-8 is
our observation that Brachyury upregulation in response to
IL-8 treatment of tumor cells is a necessary step for the
induction of invasiveness as well as fibronectin expression,
a typical marker of mesenchymal phenotype.
The induction of EMT in human mammary epithelial cells
has been shown to enrich a population of cells with stem cell–
like properties, characterized by a CD44high/CD24low phenotype (39, 40). This association between the acquisition of a
mesenchymal-like phenotype and tumor stemness has also
been recently proposed by the demonstration that residual
breast tumor cell populations surviving postconventional
treatments are enriched in CD44þ/CD24/low cells that also
exhibit mesenchymal features (41). In recent reports, it has
been shown that the IL-8/IL-8RA axis plays a critical role in
cancer stem cell function; the expression of IL-8RA has been
shown to be elevated in populations of breast cancer stem
cells (CSC), characterized by a high activity of aldehyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH; ref. 42). Moreover, the addition of
IL-8 to breast cancer cell lines has been shown to enhance
the percentage of ALDH-positive cells, as well as to promote
the invasion and chemotaxis of CSCs (42). The concepts
emerging from these studies are brought together by the
results from our studies, as the induction of Brachyury expression in epithelial tumor cells not only promotes EMT, which
has been associated with tumor stemness, but also induces the
IL-8/IL-8R axis, which, in turn, has been shown to promote the
tumor-initiating phenotype.
The data in this study further strengthen the role of the
epithelial–mesenchymal phenotypic switch of tumor cells
along the course of tumor progression by showing that tumor
cells undergoing this phenotypic switch are also endowed with
the capacity to secrete a milieu of cytokines, chemokines, and
growth factors that could potentiate metastatic dissemination
by the modulation of the stroma and/or tumor compartments.
The development of strategies aimed at interfering with
cytokine and growth factor regulatory loops appears then
as a rational approach for improving therapeutic efficacy
against tumor progression. In particular, from our results,
blockade of the IL-8/IL-8R axis seems an attractive strategy
that could result in the reversion of the metastatic phenotype
of Brachyury-positive tumor cells by interfering with the
autocrine positive loop between Brachyury and IL-8 signaling.
In addition, blockade of the IL-8/IL-8R axis could also lessen
the paracrine signals that Brachyury-positive tumor cells
could exert on other epithelial, nonmetastatic tumor cells,
as well as on the various cellular components of the stroma.

The results here provide a further mechanism by which agents
that target IL-8 signaling in solid tumors might favor clinical
outcome by suppressing the EMT-promoting activity of the IL8/IL-8R axis, thus preventing the switch of tumor cells from an
