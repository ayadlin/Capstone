ABSTRACT
In general, detection of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) occurs at the late stage
when there is no treatment option. In the present study, we designed novel drug
delivery systems that are functionalized with anti-CD133 antibodies. The C1, C2
and C3 complexes with cisplatin were introduced into nanotubes, either physically
or chemically. The complexes were reacted with anti-CD133 antibody to form the
labeled product of A0-o-CX-chem-CD133. Cytotoxicity screening of all the complexes
was performed on CHO cells. Data showed that both C2 and C3 Pt-complexes are
more cytotoxic than C1. Flow-cytometry analysis showed that nanotubes conjugated
to CD133 antibody have the ability to target cells expressing the CD133 antigen
which is responsible for the emergence of resistance to chemotherapy and disease
recurrence. The shortest survival rate was observed in the control mice group (K3)
where no hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy procedures were used. On the
other hand, the longest median survival rate was observed in the group treated with
A0-o-C1-chem-CD133. In summary, we designed a novel drug delivery system based
on carbon nanotubes loaded with Pt-prodrugs and functionalized with anti-CD133
antibodies. Our data demonstrates the effectiveness of the new drug delivery system
and provides a novel therapeutic modality in the treatment of melanoma.

INTRODUCTION

well as imaging [29-34].
In the present study, we determined whether
selected nanovehicles based on anti-CD133 antibodies
bioconiugated to carbon nanotubes loaded with platinum
(Pt) -prodrugs could be successfully used as targeted drug
delivery systems in modified hyperthermic intraperitoneal
chemotherapy without perfusion. New anti-cancer
complexes, namely cis-[PtCl2(dbtp)2] (labeled C2), where
dbtp is 5,7-ditertbutyl-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine, and
[Pt(C4H4O5)(dbtp)2] (labeled C3), have been synthesized
and their efficacy compared to unmodified CDDP (C1).
In addition, we tested whether nanovehicles can prolong
survival via induced peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) in
mice. We proposed to establish drug delivery system that
is more efficient and present the most significant inhibiting
effect on melanoma cell growth induced by PC in a mouse
model.

Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) presents a
significant challenge within current surgical oncology.
PC refers to a variety of organ-based malignancies in the
peritoneal cavity resulting from uncontrolled and rapidly
progressing metastatic processes [1-3]. PC has a very
poor prognosis and it is invariably terminal [4-7]. Indeed,
there is a serious lack of treatment options for patients
suffering from advanced-stage PC. The combination of
palliative cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic
intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) are promising
and significantly improve the patient’s quality of life.
However, these combinations are characterized by a high
in-hospital mortality rate and short periods of survival [89].
Nanotechnology has had a significant impact on
medicine [10-12]. The application of nanotechnology
in melanoma treatment highlights several nanoparticledelivered drugs approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration, which are currently in clinical trials [13].
Low molecular weight drugs such as cisplatin or cisdiamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP) have been shown to
accumulate in cancerous tissue whilst quickly penetrating
the circulatory system. Such drug delivery systems
subsequently increase the therapeutic effect of platinum
complexes by enhancing cytotoxicity within the tumor due
to their slow release. Novel drug delivery-systems (DDS)
that are based on different types of nanoparticles can
potentially act as nano-containers for targeted anti-cancer
treatment. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are among the most
frequently used DDS [14-16].
Direct targeting of cancerous tissues with anticancer drugs can be achieved via several strategies.
Typically, antibodies are directed towards specific surface
antigens or receptor proteins within tumor cells enabling
drugs or drug carriers to be delivered to the target [17]. The
nano-material is functionalized with a specific recognition
mechanism such as those decorated with antibodies, giving
rise to new and efficient delivery systems for both locally
or systemically administered drugs [18]. Indeed, the
development of functionalized nano-materials is one of the
driving forces in the recent development of new materials
classes for applications in biology and medicine. In
particular, CNTs, with their unique physical and chemical
properties hold great promise for drug delivery and have
been used to directly target tumors in the last few years
[19-23]. CNTs have water solubility and biocompatibility
properties and are able to cross cell membranes, shuttling
a wide range of biologically active molecules into cells
[24-28]. CNTs have excellent stability in the aqueous
phase and can be bioconjugated to targeting ligands such
as antibodies and peptides. These novel DDS are able to
recognize specific cell receptors and provide targeted CNT
bioconjugates, which are useful for biological sensing as

RESULTS
Thermal analysis of prodrugs and drug delivery
systems
Thermal analysis results for pure C2 (/C3) and for
A0-o, A0-o-C2 (/C3)-phys, A0-o-C2 (/C3)-chem-n, A0o-C2 (/C3)-chem are displayed in Figure 2. For the both
complexes after drug deposition, we observed higher
thermal stability (comparing to the drug alone) of C2 (/
C3) on nanotubes. The comparison of thermogravimetric
curves determined for pure C2 and C3 drugs shows lower
thermal stability of the latter. This can be caused by the
different nature of the Pt (II) - ligand bonds. Since both
prodrugs and dbtp are common ligands, one can conclude
that the differences in drugs thermal stability are caused
by the nature of the bonds between the central ion and two
other ligands. In the case of the C2 complexes, the ligand
is bonded to the central Pt(II) ion by Cl(I) while in C3
the O(II)-Pt(II) bonds occur. Following the HSAB theory
since O(II) is a hard base, and Pt(II) is a soft acid one can
expect weaker bond than for Pt(II) - Cl(I).
In general, lower thermal stability is observed for
nanotubes after drug deposition. This is probably due to
catalytic activity of Pt in nanotubes decomposition. More
importantly, the mass loss of the A0-o-C2-phys and A0-oC3-phys samples corresponded to the 2:1 C2 (/C3): A0-o
mass ratio after burning. However, additional purification
in DMF (or acetone) was necessary to remove physically
adsorbed drugs from chemical bonded complexes (A0o-C2(/C3)-chem-n and A0-o-C2 (/C3)-chem).

higher extent. Data in Figure 5 shows that initially, the
nanotubes display high adsorption followed by a decrease
after the deposition of drugs permeated the pores. In the
case where drugs were physically adsorbed, there was
a near disappearance of hysteresis in the isotherm and
the adsorption rate decreased from C1 to C2 to C3. This
decrease was inversely proportional to the volumes of
the complexes (C3 having the largest volume and C1 the
smallest). The drastic decrease in the volume of mesopores
results from the conductive effect of large amounts of
drug clusters located between the nanotubes that block the
internal channels.

Cytotoxicity analyses

Pt-complexes ranging from 1 μg ml-1 and 50μg ml-1 was
expressed as a percentage of control and decreased from
84% to 31 % and from 91% to 1%, respectively.
In contrast, A0-o appeared to be nontoxic at the
highest concentration, whilst the decrease in cell viability
was 60% at the lowest concentration due to its cytostatic
properties. Meanwhile, A0-o-C1-phys remained non-toxic
(with over 90% viability at a concentration of 50 μg ml1
), while the C2 and C3 Pt-complexes showed toxicity is
concentration-dependent. On the other hand, the highest
concentration of A0-o-C3-phys decreased cell viability

Cytotoxicity analyses were performed to evaluate
the potential therapeutic application of the drug delivery
systems. All prodrug delivery systems (Pt-complexes,
nanotubes) were assessed for their cytotoxicity in CHO
cells by MTT assay and LDH activity. Data in Figure
6A showed that both the C2 and C3 Pt-complexes are
more toxic than that of the C1. The viability of CHO
cells treated with different concentrations of C2 and C3

to below 20%. Interestingly, the chemical bonding of Ptcomplexes to the surface of the nanotubes did not cause
any significant alterations in their levels of toxicity.
The LDH activity data in Figure 6B showed similar
cytotoxic properties and concentration-dependence across
all Pt-complexes. Cells treated with Pt-complexes did
not reveal any dramatic differences between materials
prepared through physical adsorption or chemical bonding.
Interestingly, only treatment with the C2 complexes
caused excessive increase in LDH activity as a marker of
cell membrane damage (Figure 6B).

The anti-cancer properties were tested in B16
melanoma cells. Cell proliferation data for the free drugs
and those delivered via nanotubes are shown in Figure 7.
Cells treated with C1 and C3 compounds did not show any
changes in cell proliferation at low and high concentrations
while low concentrations of the C2 complex (10 and 50 μg
ml-1) showed a decrease in cell proliferation compared to
control (Figure 7). In all treatments, the cell index (CI)
values remained above the baseline when the lowest (10

differences at higher concentrations (50 – 250 μg ml1
). One the other hand, the drugs that were chemically
bonded to nanotubes appeared to have weaker effect on
cell proliferation compared to those that were adsorbed
physically. One exception was the A0-o-C3-chem
complex where a decrease in the CI value compared to
the baseline level was observed at longest exposure. The
remaining two complexes in this group did not cause a
decrease the CI even at the highest concentration (250
μg ml-1). The weakest anti-cancer activity was observed
in the A0-o-C1-chem complex where 10 and 50 μg ml-1
concentrations resulted in the same CI value as the control
(Figure 7). Moreover, the increase in DDS concentration
led to a decrease in cell viability and possibly increased

the rate of cell death. Taken together, the platinum drugs
adsorbed physically on nanotubes were found to be the
most effective tools against B16 melanoma cells.
The LT50 was calculated on the basis of results
obtained from real-time cell analysis (Figure 8). LT50
is defined as the time needed to decrease the number of
cells by 50% in comparison to the number of cells present
initially (arrows on Figure 7). For the C2 compound, a
decrease in the LT50 in the presence of DDS was observed
in both chemically and physically modified systems
indicating that B16 cells are most sensitive to the C2
compounds. In all cases, a decrease in number of B16 cells
was observed in a dose-dependent manner, but A0-o-C1chem appeared to be completely non-toxic.

potential in the treatment of melanoma.
Such an innovative approach could be clinically
more beneficial and effective in the palliative treatment
of PC than the HIPEC method that is currently employed.
Several recent in vitro and in vivo studies on anticancer
strategies based on novel drug delivery tools and targeted
therapy mechanisms have been reported [49]. Previous
studies have also shown that carbon nanotubes are good
delivery tools, which can control the bioavailability of
a drug depending on its location [34]. Recent strategies
for treating cancer have utilized antibodies that have
been directed against specific surface antigens or
receptor proteins within tumor cells. This strategy has
proven efficient at targeting drugs or their carriers to
the specific area requiring treatment [50]. DDS could
prove more effective in chemotherapy than HIPEC due
to the prolonged drug release properties. Current HIPEC
treatment procedures are characterized by intraperitoneal
perfusion of 1-3 hours in one intraoperative session [51,
52]. This results in limited clinical effectiveness due to
the relatively short time that cancer cells are exposed
to cytostatic drugs, explaining why some patients also
later qualify for standard systemic chemotherapy.
Another related problem is that not all patients in the
relevant clinical condition qualify for multiple HIPEC
interventions [53]. Melanoma is not the most common
cause of PC in humans. It is most commonly associated
with ovarian cancer, malignant mesothelioma, benign
papillary mesothelioma and desmoplastic small round cell
tumors [54, 55].
The anticancer properties of DDS against melanoma
cells were previously described [56, 57]. In order to
construct a novel DDS with anticancer properties, standard
anticancer drugs were chosen such as Pt(II) complexes.
The efficacy of CDDP has been determined by evaluating

DISCUSSION
This study evaluated the potential of selected
nanovehicles in modified targeted hyperthermic
intraperitoneal chemotherapy without perfusion as a novel
chemotherapeutic strategy for peritoneal carcinomatosis.
Current interest in the field of experimental surgical
oncology is geared towards improving standard clinical
outcomes of melanoma. These generally focus on
important areas such as survival rates and the quality
of life [46, 47]. One important issue is how oncologic
outcomes can be enhanced through the modification
of current clinical procedures like HIPEC for patients
suffering from PC [48]. Our in vitro and in vivo data
show that novel drug delivery systems represented by
nanovehicles (nanocontainers with the selected cytostatics
and supported by a specific antibody) have a great deal of

the chemosensitivity of melanoma cells [58,59]. Prodrugs
were also introduced free or bound to nanotubes using
physical or chemical methods, providing a more flexible
approach. The cytotoxicity screening of all the particular
elements (Pt-complexes, nanotubes) as well as the drug
delivery systems was performed on normal rodent CHO
cells. Both C2 and C3 Pt-complexes are more toxic than
the C1 variant whereas the nanotubes themselves (A0o) seem to be nontoxic even when applied at the highest
doses. These observations suggest that A0-o systems could
be used for novel DDS applications for cancer treatment.
The chemical bonding of Pt-complexes to the nanotube
surfaces failed to induce any significant alterations in
their toxicity whilst the A0-o-C3-chem system proved
most toxic. Of all complexes, only C2 acted in a different
manner from the rest in that its use resulted in excessive
cell membrane damage. Overall, the effectiveness of
the new drug delivery systems indicates that this novel
approach is a useful therapeutic direction to follow in
attempting to treat this type of melanoma. The data
demonstrates that nanotubes can be used to effectively
deliver therapeutics to the nucleus of a cell while the large
drug delivery systems were unable to enter the cell and
therefore exhibited reduced cytotoxicity. This effect is
more pronounced in normal cells since their proliferation
rate was much slower than in cancer cells.
Another important aspect of the data was how
the anti-CD133 antibody was successfully attached
to nanotubes. Flow-cytometry analysis showed that
nanotubes connected to the antibody have the ability to
target cells expressing CD133 antigen and can potentially
be used in experimental therapy against cancer stem
cells. CD133-positive melanoma cells are phenotypically
characterized as melanoma cancer stem cells [60, 61],
which are resistant to chemotherapy and responsible for
disease reoccurrence [62]. Differences were also noted
between slow-acting and fast-acting DDS during the in
vitro experiments on B16 cell lines: the LT50 was found to
be shorter in the case of samples obtained using physical
methods. Real-time cell analysis also showed that drugs
administered alone and those delivered physically with
nanotubes acted similarly, whilst there was a slower
decrease shown in the proliferation rate when chemically
modified nanotubes were employed. This phenomenon
can be explained by the gradual release of drugs after
chemical modification leading to a prolonged effect on
cell proliferation. Overall, this data suggests that treatment
with the new DDS increases the effectiveness of Pt-based
drugs and could lead to an improvement in the efficiency
of the anticancer treatment.
The in vivo study showed the shortest survival
rate in the control group (K3) where no hyperthermic
intraperitoneal chemotherapy procedures were used and
surgical cytoreduction of tumor masses was performed.
This result could be due to two factors: First, the surgical
procedure was not accompanied by any type of adjuvant
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Second, the standard
“Sugarbaker’s protocol” and its numerous modifications
assume the implementation of cytoreduction only in
groups of patients who meet all qualification criteria
for HIPEC [63, 64]. In this study, cytoreduction was
performed on all animals from group K3 in the absence of
a Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) or any exclusion criteria
such as that applied to those with a substantially large
tumor that possibly resulted in a higher mortality rate
[65]. On the other hand, the longest survival median rate
was observed in the group A0-o-C1-chem. That may due
to the fact that the drugs that were used for in vitro tests
exhibited high levels of activity and caused a lot of side
effects including killing healthy cells. Therefore, in order
to create effective DDS with minimal side effects, it is
necessary to use slow-acting systems functionalized with
targeting moieties i.e. DDS with antibodies and conjugated
prodrugs. Overall, the main benchmark from analysis of
the results was found in the survival rate of the control
group (K1) where no experimental procedures were
performed after the implantation of the B16 melanoma
cells. It is striking that this group had longer survival rates
versus many of the groups where experimental procedures
were carried out. This is likely due to their invasive
nature as well as complications associated with surgery
and chemotherapy. Many of these approaches are used to
relieve pain, and improve the quality of life and cannot be
evaluated or compared when using the small rodent model
[66,67].
The most important aspect of this study is findings
that carbon nanotubes can be used as DDS in light of
ongoing controversy in several publications suggesting
that carbon nanotubes themselves exhibit a high level of
cytotoxicity [57, 58]. Our study suggests to the contrary
that cytotoxicity is observed when nanotubes are used
either in vitro or in vivo. The manifestation of CNT
cytotoxicity could be explained by the presence of residual
metallic catalysts in nanoparticles that were observed
mainly in cell culture studies [68-70]. In summary, we
tested novel drug delivery systems based on carbon
nanotubes loaded with Pt-prodrugs and functionalized
with anti-CD133 antibodies. The DDS have been found
to be useful tools in targeted anti-cancer therapy in both
in vitro and in vivo studies. We found most effective
planned and targeted palliative therapy on experimental

MATERIALS AND METHODS

2:1. To attach the C2 (/C3) complex to the carbon surface,
a solution of A0-o sample (75 mg) in 1 ml of isopropanol
was used to fill the carbon nanotubes. The synthesis of
A0-o-C2- and A0-o-C3 are outlined in schemes 4 and 5.
Following this, the sample was dispersed by sonication
in a mixture of water (15 ml) and several drops of 0.1M
NaOH added gradually to 20mg of C2 (/C3) to obtain a
slightly alkaline solution. These conditions forced both
reagents, i.e. oxidized CNT and C2 (/C3) complex to be
hydrolyzed. The resulting solution was vigorously stirred
for about 44 hours at room temperature. The mixture was
then filtered through a 0.45 μm filter (the sample labeled
A0-o-C2 (/C3)-chem-n, where n means “not washed”)
and washed with DMF (in the case of C2; 3 x 10 ml) or
acetone (in the case of C3; 3 x 10 ml) before being dried
in a vacuum chamber at temperature of 323K to give A0o-C2 (/C3)-chem.

Nanotubes and drug deposition
Open-ended high-purity single-walled carbon
nanotubes (labeled A0-o) were obtained from
Nanostructured & Amorphous Materials (NanoAmor,
Houston, TX, USA). These were hydrothermally oxidized
using 30% H2O2 at 493 K temperature as previously
described [34,35]. C2 was synthesized by reaction of
K2PtCl4 with dbtp at a molar ratio of M:L = 1:2 as outlined
in scheme 1 [36]. Reaction of C2 with Ag2C4H4O5
[Pt(C4H4O5)(dbtp)2] was performed to obtain C3 as
shown in scheme 2 [36]. Both coordination compounds
had previously been structurally characterized by IR; 1H,
13
C, 15N, 195Pt NMR, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction
[37,38].
The C1, C2 and C3 complexes were then introduced
to the nanotubes by either physical deposition through a
simple evaporation process or chemically bonded. As
outlined in scheme 3, the synthesis of A0-o-C1-chem was
achieved using a modified procedure previously described
by Ye et al [39]. The C1 complex (20mg) was added to
20 ml of water and mixed with 11.8 mg of silver nitrate
to form an aqueous complex [36]. The resulting AgCl
precipitate was centrifuged at a speed of 8000xg and the
supernatant was filtered twice through a 0.22μm filter
before being attached to the carbon surface A0-o sample
(75 mg) dissolved in 1 ml of isopropanol. To achieve a
slightly alkaline environment, several drops of 0.1M
NaOH were added to the purified supernatant. The solution
was then mixed vigorously for 24 hours at temperature of
310K. Next, the mixture was filtered through a 0.8μm filter
(the sample labeled A0-o-C1-chem-n, where n means “not
washed”) and washed with DMF (3x10 ml). The products
were dried in a vacuum chamber at a temperature of 323
K.
Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum
C1
(CDDP,
Sigma–Aldrich, 99.9% pure) was deposited as previously
described [40]. A sample of A0-o-493 (30 mg) was
dispersed (by sonication) into a solution of CDDP (60 mg)
in water (10 ml) and vigorously stirred for about 20 hours
at room temperature. Next, the solvent was removed by
evaporation in a vacuum chamber at 323K. The resulting
sample was labeled as A0-o-C1–phys and had a CDDP:
nanotube mass ratio of 2:1. The physical deposition of C2
was performed as follows: an A0-o sample (30 mg) was
dispersed by sonication in a solution of C2 (60 mg) in10
ml of ethanol (or in10 ml of acetone in the case of C3)
and stirred for about 20 hours at room temperature. The
organic solvents were used to prevent the hydrolysis of
the Pt-complexes. Next, the solvent was evaporated using
a vacuum chamber at a temperature of 323K to yield of
A0-o-C2 (/C3)-phys with C2(/C3):nanotube mass ratio of

Preparation of A0-o-CX-chem-CD133 complex
The synthesis of A0-o-CX-chem-CD133 was
achieved using a multistep process. First, a sample of
A0-o-CX-chem (10 mg) was dispersed (via sonication)
in 10ml of PBS and then stirred for about one hour at a
temperature of 277 K to attach the BSA (10 mg) to the
CNT. Next, the sediment was centrifuged, washed with
PBS (3 times) and dispersed via sonication. EDC (38 mg)
and NHS (58 mg) were then added and the mixture was
stirred for approximately one hour at a temperature of 277
K. The resulting mixture was dispersed (via sonication)
in 5 ml of PBS, followed by addition of anti-CD133
antibody at concentration of 0.2 mg/ml (Biorbyt LLC,
USA). The mixture was then stirred for 2 hours at 277 K
and centrifuged. The resulting sediment was washed with
PBS (3 times) to yield the final product of A0-o-CX-chemCD133, which was stored at a temperature of 277 K in
PBS.

Electron microscopy and thermal analysis
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) images were taken using a transmission
electron microscope F20X-TWIN (FEI-Tecnai). In
addition, Z-contrast imaging was done with a scanning
TEM equipped with a Fischione HAADF (High Angle
Annular Dark Field) detector. Both devices operated at a
voltage of 200 kV. For thermogravimetric measurements
of the atmosphere, simultaneous TGA-DTA Thermal
Analysis TA Instruments (SDT 2960) was used at a
temperature range of 293-1073 K at a heating rate of
10K/min. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured
using an ASAP2010 volumetric adsorption analyzer from
Micromeritics (Norcross, GA), which was operated at
the temperature of liquid nitrogen (77K) and at pressures
ranging from about 10–6 to 0.999. The A0-o-C1 samples

the samples loaded with C2 and/or C3 were heated at
373K.

for an additional 72 hours. Viability was expressed in cell
index (CI) values. The increase in electrode impedance on
an E-Plate due to the increase in cell numbers attached to
the electrodes was used to monitor the viability, number,
morphology, and the degree of adhesion within a number
of cell-based assays. The experiment was repeated three
times with isolated cells with a cell-free medium serving
as control. The average curves plotted in Figure 7 displays
the relative values compared to the control and were
calculated using the method described by WerengowskaCiećwierz et al [40].

In vitro cytotoxicity and proliferation assays
Cytotoxicity screening of A0-o loaded with Pt
complexes was carried out using CHO (Chinese hamster
ovary) cells. These are rodent epithelial adherent cells
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and cultured according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. These cells are used regularly
as mammalian cell models in biological, medical and
pharmaceutical research [41,42]. Approximately 5x104
cells were seeded into each well of a 12-well plate for
24 hours and grown in F-12 medium (containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg ml-1streptomycin and
100 U ml-1 penicillin) in an incubator with 5% CO2 at
temperature of 309K. CHO cells were treated with each of
Pt complexes at concentrations of 1, 10, and 50μg ml-1 and
tested in time-dependent manner from 24 to 72h.
The effect of DDS on cell growth and viability
was then examined in triplicate through MTT and LDH
activity assays. The MTT solution was prepared at a
concentration of 1 mg ml-1 in F-12 medium and then added
into each well containing the CHO cells. Following an
incubation period of 15 min, the solution was discarded
and a solution of Formosan crystals dissolved in DMSO
was added and their absorbance measured at a wavelength
of 570nm. LDH was then employed to convert pyruvate
to lactate in the presence of NADH as a proton donor and
its level of activity measured within a culture medium
by the observable decrease of NADH into its oxidized
form of NAD (β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).
The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 340 nm
using a spectrophotometer and directly correlated with the
increase in the number of damaged cells. For the LDH
activity assay, 100 μl of NADH (1.25 mg ml-1) and 100 μl
of sodium pyruvate (2.5 mg ml-1) were added into 600μl of
culture medium before the number of living and damaged
cells was compared to the control sample.
Mouse melanoma cells B16-F10 (CRL-6475™)
were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and cultured in
DMEM/HAM’s F-12 medium containing 10% of FBS
supplemented with 5-μg ml-1 of amphotericin B, 100-μg
ml-1 of streptomycin, and 100 U ml-1 of penicillin (pH 7.4).
The cells were grown in 25 cm2 flasks (PAA, Austria)
with 5% CO2 atmosphere at a temperature of 309K. The
effect of DDS on tumor cells was then measured using
the Real Time Cell Analyzer (RTCA) (x-CELLigence
system, Roche Applied Science), which enabled cellular
events to be monitored in real time. The cells (n = 4000)
were subsequently seeded onto all the wells of an E-Plate
16 (Roche Applied Science) and incubated in cell culture
medium for 20 hours. Varying concentrations of DDS (10,
50, 150 and 250 μg ml-1) were then added and incubated

Flow cytometry analysis
Cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of a
hematopoietic donor that had been stimulated with high
dose G-CSF (Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor)
(amounting to 10 mcg/kg of filgrastim per day over
4 days). Mononuclear cells were separated from the
peripheral blood by apheresis using the cell separator
Cobe®Spectra (Terumbo BCT, USA). The isolated cells
contained mainly lymphocytes and monocytes and a large
amount of hematopoietic cells together with platelets and
a small number of erythrocytes.
The cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold FACS
Buffer (PBS with 5% FBS) and incubated for one hour in
the dark at a temperature of 4°C with the FITC-labeled
anti-CD133 antibody connected to nanotubes. The cells
were washed 3 times by centrifugation and resuspended
in 500μl of ice-cold FACS buffer and maintained in this
state until CD133 expression analysis was performed
using FACSCanto flow cytometry (BD Bioscience, USA).

Peritoneal carcinomatosis animal model
Ten weeks old C57BL/6J mice were obtained from
Charles River strain. Animals were divided into 12 groups
(where n = 5 in each group): four control groups and eight
study groups (labeled as: C1, C2, C3, A0-o-C1-chem,
A0-o-C2-chem, A0-o-C3-chem, A0-o-C1-chem-CD133,
A0-o-C3-chem-CD133) were designed to test all new
nanovehicles. Table 1 shows the details of treated and
control groups as well as the type of the DDS employed.
All animal procedures followed guidelines approved
by the Ethical Committee of official European Union
recommendations and guidelines (2010/63/EU) of animal
use.
To artificially create peritoneal carcinomatosis, B16
mouse melanoma (CRL-6475™) cells were used. The
B16 cells were cultured according to the manufacturer’s
conditions in 25-cm2 Nunc T-flasks at a temperature of
309K in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95%
humidity until the 3rd passage. About 1 x 106 cells were
injected into the lower-right quadrant of the abdomen
(Figure 1). Injections were performed in a rigorously

Melanoma cells were implanted for a week
after which the PC process could be clearly observed.
Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy was
administered without perfusion using the range of DDS
across all eight-study groups. Before the DDS were
administered, they were sonicated in 0.7 ml of sterile
PBS for 3 minutes to obtain a homogenous solution. It is
believed that this volume of PBS is the optimum amount,
which could be safely applied to the peritoneal cavity for
any period of time and constitutes approximately 25-29
% of the total blood volume (TBV) in mice, to reduce
postoperative complications [43]. To replicate the clinical
standards of HIPEC treatment without perfusion, a
previously prepared solution containing chemotherapeutic
DDS was also heated to the average HIPEC solution
temperature of 43°C [44,45].
After disinfecting the operating area and inducing
anesthesia, a midline incision along the linea alba was
performed on all animals in the study groups. Following
preparation of the skin, muscles and other tissues, the
abdominal cavity was exposed as shown in a Figure 1.
Employing the classic open method of hyperthermic
intraperitoneal chemotherapy, a Castroviejo eye speculum
was used to hold the abdominal wall open and standard
surgical sutures were used to close off the surgical area
after treatment (Figure 1).
