Abstract
Cancer therapy often produces anemia, which is treated with erthropoietin (EPO) to stimulate erythrocyte production. However, concerns have recently arisen that EPO treatment may promote later tumor
metastasis and mortality. The mechanisms underlying such effects are unknown, but it is clear that EPO has
pleiotropic effects in cell types other than hematopoietic cells. In this study, we investigated how EPO
affects lymphangiogenesis and lymph node tumor metastasis in mouse models of breast cancer and
melanoma. In these models, EPO increased lymph node lymphangiogenesis and lymph node tumor
metastasis in a manner associated with increased migration, capillary-like tube formation, and doseand time-dependent proliferation of human lymphatic endothelial cells. EPO increased sprouting of these
cells in a thoracic duct lymphatic ring assay. These effects were abrogated by cotreatment with specific
inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase or mitogen-activated protein kinase, under conditions in which EPO
increased Akt and extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation. Intraperitoneal administration of EPO stimulated peritoneal lymphangiogenesis, and systemic treatment of EPO increased infiltration
of CD11bþ macrophages in tumor-draining lymph nodes. Finally, EPO increased VEGF-C expression in
lymph node–derived CD11bþ macrophages as well as in bone marrow–derived macrophages in a dose- and
time-dependent manner. Our results establish that EPO exerts a powerful lymphangiogenic function
and can drive both lymph node lymphangiogenesis and nodal metastasis in tumor-bearing animals. Cancer

Introduction
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a specific stimulator of erythropoiesis, exhibiting pleiotropic effects in various cell types other
than hematopoietic cells (1–3). Anemia is associated with low
quality of life in cancer patients who receive chemotherapy and
with poor response to cancer treatment (4). Treatment of
anemia with EPO may increase quality of life and prevent
complications associated with blood transfusions in cancer
patients. EPO treatment increases radiosensitivity of tumor,
therewith increasing survival rate among patients with cancer

(5). However, clinical trial data have indicated that EPO treatment does not increase the survival rate of cancer patients with
head and neck (6), lung (7), or breast (8) cancer. In fact, EPO may
accelerate tumor progression (6–8). Although the exact
mechanism of EPO-induced tumor progression remains to be
understood, several mechanisms of EPO-induced tumor progression have been proposed. EPO may increase EPO receptor
(EPOR) expression in preexisting tumor cells, thereby promoting tumor metastasis (6, 8–10). It increases the growth of tumors
lacking EPOR through tumor angiogenesis (11). Thus, increased
peritumoral angiogenesis through direct or indirect effects on
endothelial cells has been introduced as another mechanism in
EPO-induced tumor progression (9, 12–14).
In addition, malignant tumors, including melanoma and
breast cancers, preferentially metastasize via lymphatic vessels to regional lymph nodes, and peritumoral lymphangiogenesis predicts lymph node metastasis (15). Lymph node
lymphangiogenesis has also been shown to be associated with
lymphatic metastases in animal models (16, 17). It has been
shown that the lymphangiogenesis in the sentinel lymph node
is initiated before tumor metastasis in the lymph nodes (18,
19). Thus, lymph node lymphangiogenesis can be an important factor in lymph node tumor metastasis. However, a direct
link between EPO and lymph node lymphangiogenesis has not
been reported.

Erythropoietin Induces Lymphangiogenesis

VEGF-C is an angiogenic factor mainly involved in lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) growth. Macrophages produce and
secrete VEGF-C and play a critical role in lymphangiogenesis
(19). VEGF-C from macrophages induces lymphangiogenesis
in advanced ovarian cancer (20). In a mouse breast cancer
model, the tumor progression is related to macrophage infiltration in the primary tumors (21). Despite these correlations
between macrophage and tumor lymphangiogenesis, the
effect of EPO on macrophages in promoting tumor and lymph
node lymphangiogenesis is largely unexplored.
In this study, we investigated an involvement of EPO in
lymph node lymphangiogenesis, using a murine model
of melanoma and breast cancer and human lymphatic
endothelial cells (hLEC). The molecular basis of EPOmediated lymphangiogenesis and role of macrophages in
lymphangiogenesis were also examined in vitro and ex vivo.
The results showed that EPO induces lymphangiogenesis
through increasing VEGF-C expression in lymph node
CD11bþ macrophages and bone marrow–derived macrophages and that EPO-induced lymphangiogenesis is mediated
through the Akt- and extracellular signal–regulated kinase
(ERK) 1/2-dependent pathway.

metastasis of melanoma cancer cells to mouse axillary
lymph nodes. Frozen sections of lymph nodes were immunostained with antibodies against LYVE-1 (AngioBio), Prox1 (ReliaTech), and Podoplanin (R&D Systems) to detect LECs
in lymph nodes. An antibody against PECAM-1 (Millipore)
was used to evaluate the changes of vascular endothelial
cells in lymph nodes.
Cell culture
hLECs (Lonza) were incubated and maintained in endothelial basal medium-2 (EBM-2) medium (Lonza) with 5% (v/v)
heat-inactivated FBS at 37 C in a 5% CO2/95% O2 incubator.
For bone marrow–derived macrophages, bone marrow was
isolated from femurs and tibias, and cultured in Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 30%
L929 conditioned media. Recombinant human EPO (Epokine)
was purchased from CJ Pharm. Recombinant human VEGF-A
165 was purchased from R&D Systems. Mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor,
PD98059, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor,
LY294002, wortmannin, gelatin, antibiotics, and antimycotics
were from Sigma-Aldrich.

Materials and Methods
Methods are described in greater detail in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Animal experiments
Breast cancer mouse model. The animal experimental
protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Chonbuk National
University. MDA-MB-231 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were inoculated into the left flank of female nude
mice (Orient Bio Inc.; 18–20 g body weight; ref. 22). EPO at a
dose of 5,000 IU/kg was injected s.c. 3 times per week. After
14 days, lymph node volume was measured as previously
described (23) and processed for immunofluorescent staining (24).
Melanoma cancer mouse model. C57BL/6 mice (Orient
Bio Inc.) were injected with 1  106 B16-F10 cells (American
Type Culture Collection) in a 100-mL volume of PBS in the left
flank. EPO at a dose of 5,000 IU/kg was injected s.c. 3 times per
week. After 7 days, lymph node volume was measured as
previously described (23) and harvested for immunofluorescent staining and isolation of CD11bþ macrophages (24).
Peritoneal lymphangiogenesis. For EPO-induced peritoneal lymphangiogenesis, the indicated dose of EPO
(5,000 IU/kg) in 200 mL of PBS was injected into the peritoneal cavity daily for 7 days.
Immunofluorescence
To determine the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 human
breast cancer cells to mouse axillary lymph nodes, mouse
lymph nodes were stained with an antibody against human
mitochondria (Millipore), which specifically acts on human
cells to evaluate lymph node metastasis of breast cancer.
Mouse lymph node sections were immunostained with an

Migration assay
The migration assay with hLECs was conducted using a
modified Boyden chamber (NeuroProbe) as described previously (25).
Capillary-like tube formation assay
In vitro tube formation assay was conducted in a 3-dimensional culture of hLECs on ECM gel (Sigma-Aldrich; ref. 25).
Cell proliferation by XTT assay
After 48 hours of treatment with EPO (5, 10, or 20 IU/mL),
proliferation of hLECs was measured using a Cell Proliferation
Kit II (XTT; Roche) in accordance with the manufacturer's
protocol.
Immunoblotting
hLECs treated with various drugs were harvested, homogenized, and then immunoblotted as described previously
(26).
Thoracic duct collection and 3-dimensional lymphatic
ring assay
Identification and harvest of thoracic ducts were conducted
as described previously (27). EPO (5, 10, or 20 IU/mL), control
buffer, or recombinant mouse VEGF-A (R&D Systems) was
added to the culture medium at the beginning of the experiment, as appropriate. Anti-EPO (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or
anti-VEGF-A (ReliaTech) was used to evaluate the blocking
effect of EPO or VEGF-A on sprouting of LECs.
Isolation of CD11bþ cells from draining lymph nodes by
MACS
CD11bþ macrophages in the lymph nodes were enriched
using anti-mouse CD11bþ antibody–coupled MicroBeads

(Miltenyi Biotec) and a magnetic cell sorter (MACS; Miltenyi
Biotec) as described previously (24).
Reverse transcriptase-PCR of lymphangiogenic factors
The semiquantitative and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) of total RNA isolated from hLEC, MACSenriched CD11bþ cells, and bone marrow–derived macrophages was conducted.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean  SD. Student t test or one-way
ANOVA was conducted to compare the means of normally
distributed continuous variables. Because the lymph node
volume represented a skewed distribution in this experiment,
a Box–Cox transformation was conducted, converting the
lymph node volumes into log10-transformed values (28).
The level of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

Results
EPO promotes sentinel lymph node lymphangiogenesis
and lymph node tumor metastasis in breast cancer
model
We evaluated the effects of EPO on lymph nodes in a breast
cancer model by determining the volume, lymphangiogenesis,
and tumor lymph node metastasis. Lymph nodes from the
mice treated with EPO had larger volumes than those from the
mice treated with control buffer (Fig. 1A and B). The weight of
lymph nodes from the mice treated with EPO was heavier than
that from the mice treated with control buffer (data not
shown).
To examine whether EPO treatment increases lymph node
lymphangiogenesis, we immunostained lymph node sections
using antibodies against LYVE-1 and Prox-1. An increase
in LYVE-1- and Prox-1–positive lymphatic vessels was found
in sentinel lymph nodes of EPO-treated mice (Fig. 1C).
To evaluate the effect of EPO on LYVE-1–positive lymphatics and PECAM-1–positive vessels in tumor-draining lymph
nodes, we also immunostained the lymph nodes by using
LYVE-1 and PECAM-1 antibodies. Immunofluorescent staining of the sentinel lymph nodes showed that LYVE-1–positive
lymphatic or PECAM-1–positive vessels were increased in the
lymph nodes from mice treated with EPO compared with
those of control mice (Fig. 1D and E). We also found that EPO
treatment increased the density of human mitochondria–
positive cells in mouse sentinel lymph nodes compared with
those in mouse sentinel lymph nodes treated with control
buffer, indicating that the human breast tumor cells had
metastasized to the lymph nodes (Fig. 1D). The mean hematocrit level of EPO-treated mice was significantly higher than
that of mice treated with control buffer (Fig. 1F).

To ensure the aforementioned observations that EPO

and lymph node metastasis, a melanoma tumor mouse

model was examined. Treatment of the tumor-injected mice
with EPO increased the volume of lymph nodes compared
with those of the mice treated with control buffer (Fig. 2A
and B). LYVE-1- and Prox-1–positive lymphatic vessels
were increased in sentinel lymph nodes of EPO-treated mice
(Fig. 2C). EPO increased the density of LYVE-1–positive
lymphatic or PECAM-1–positive vessels in the lymph nodes
of mice compared with those of control mice (Fig. 2D and E).
EPO treatment also increased the density of pan-cytokeratin–positive melanoma cells in sentinel lymph nodes
(Fig. 2D). The mean hematocrit level of EPO-treated mice
was significantly higher than that of mice treated with
control buffer (Fig. 2F).
LYVE-1, Prox-1, Podoplanin, and EPOR are expressed in
hLECs
To confirm the identity of LECs and to evaluate whether
EPOR is expressed in hLECs, LEC makers were examined by
immnuostaining by using respective antibody. The results
showed that the LEC markers LYVE-1, Podoplanin, and
Prox-1 were expressed in hLECs (Supplementary Fig. S1),
and EPORs were also expressed in hLECs (Supplementary
Fig. S2).
EPO induces migration, capillary-like tube formation,
and proliferation of hLECs
To investigate whether EPO has in vitro lymphangiogenic
activity, we conducted migration, capillary-like tube formation, and proliferation assays with hLECs. EPO increased the
number of migrating hLECs in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 3A). Because our data indicated that EPO is a relatively
strong inducer of migration, we examined the effect of
EPO on capillary-like tube formation of hLECs in ECM
gel. After 16 hours of treatment with EPO, tube formation
was increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B and C).
EPO at 20 IU/mL increased capillary-like tube formation
approximately 18.5-fold over that of control buffer–treated
hLECs. We estimated the degree of hLEC proliferation with
an 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-S-sulfophenynl)H-tetrazolium5-carboxanilide inner salt (XTT) assay. In hLECs treated
with EPO for 48 hours, EPO significantly increased cell
proliferation over that of control (Fig. 3D). VEGF-A was
used as a positive control.
EPO increases phosphorylation of MAPK and Akt in
hLECs
To determine whether the MAPK and Akt signaling
pathway is involved in EPO-induced lymphangiogenesis, we
examined the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (p44/p42 MAPK)
and Akt. EPO increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in as short a
time as 5 minutes and produced a maximal effect at 10
minutes after EPO treatment, and then phosphorylation
returned to the control level at 15 minutes (Fig. 4A). The
maximum mean increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was 2.2fold. EPO also increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 4B). Pretreatment with an MEK
inhibitor, PD98059, significantly decreased EPO-induced
ERK1/2 phosphorylation at 10 minutes. EPO also increased

EPO increases CD11bþ macrophage infiltration in
draining lymph nodes from mice with melanoma and
breast cancer
The expression of VEGF-C increased in tumor-associated
macrophages, thereby increasing lymphatic vessel growth (29,
30). In a melanoma or breast cancer model used in this study,
the lymphangiogenesis was observed in tumor-draining lymph
nodes. Therefore, we investigated whether EPO increases the
number of CD11bþ lymph node macrophages in the melanoma or breast tumor model by immunostaining lymph node
sections with a CD11bþ antibody. Our data revealed that EPO

increased CD11bþ macrophage infiltration in draining lymph
nodes of melanoma and breast tumor mice by 1.7-fold and 1.3fold, respectively, over those in draining lymph nodes of mice
treated with melanoma and breast tumor (Fig. 6). EPO treatment alone had no effect on the number of CD11bþ macrophages in draining lymph nodes compared with the number in
mice treated with control buffer alone (Fig. 6B and D).
EPO increases VEGF-C expression in CD11bþ
macrophages from lymph nodes and bone

Because VEGF-C expression is increased in tumor-associated macrophages, we evaluated whether EPO increases
VEGF-C mRNA levels in CD11bþ macrophages from lymph
nodes of melanoma tumor mice (24, 29, 30). Quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that EPO increased
VEGF-C mRNA levels (1.6-fold) compared with those of mice
treated with control buffer in the melanoma tumor model

Discussion
Several mechanisms of EPO involvement in tumor progression have been suggested: EPO increases EPOR expression in
preexisting tumor cells, thereby increasing tumor growth and
metastasis, or directly promotes tumor vascular angiogenesis
(6, 8–10). In this study, we showed that EPO increases LEC
density and tumor metastasis in lymph nodes. Therefore, EPOinduced lymph node lymphangiogenic effects may have a role
in tumor progression.
It is well known that lymphangiogenesis in peritumoral
area and lymph node contributes to tumor metastasis
through tumor-draining lymph nodes (31, 32). EPO is a
growth factor with pleiotropic effects. Therefore, it can be
suggested that EPO may induce lymphangiogenesis and is
associated with tumor metastasis. We showed that EPO
induces sentinel lymph node lymphangiogenesis and is
associated with lymph node tumor metastasis in a mouse
human breast cancer xenograft and melanoma tumor model
(Figs. 1D and E and 2D and E). EPO treatment also increased

4514

Cancer Res; 71(13) July 1, 2011

lymph node volume compared with that of control (Figs. 1D
and E and 2A and B). These results suggest that EPO-induced
lymph node lymphangiogenesis is a new mechanism of
lymph node tumor metastasis.
Malignant tumors can increase lymphangiogenesis and
metastasize through the newly formed lymphatic system.
The growth factors associated with tumor lymphangiogenesis
are VEGF-A (16), VEGF-C (33), VEGF-D (34), FGF-2 (35), Ang-1
(36), Ang-2 (37), and PDGF-BB (38). Recently, it has also been
shown that EPO-induced release of PDGF-BB increases
smooth muscle cell–rich vascular lesions in mice (39). However, our results showed that mRNA levels of these lymphangiogenic factors in hLECs are not changed by treatment with
EPO (Supplementary Fig. S4). These findings suggest that
other lymphangiogenic growth factors are not involved in
lymphangiogenesis.
EPO-mediated invasion, migration, and adhesion of rat
mammary cells are regulated through activation of PI3K/Akt
and ERK (40). It has also been shown that EPO increases
proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells through

activation of ERK1/2, Akt, and stress-activated protein
kinase/c-Jun-NH2-kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway (41). EPOinduced angiogenesis in retinal endothelial cell is associated
with the PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway (42). Consistent with
these observations, our results showed that EPO induces
migration, proliferation, tube formation of hLECs, and
sprouting through ERK1/2- and the PI3K-dependent pathway (Fig. 4).
Macrophages are associated with tumor angiogenesis,
tumor metastasis, and immunoregulation (43). Macrophages
also produce VEGF-C, a lymphangiogenic factor (24). In this
study, the results revealed that EPO increases VEGF-C mRNA
levels from lymph node CD11bþ macrophages of mice injected
with melanoma tumor and in bone marrow–derived macrophages in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figs. 6 and 7).

These observations suggest that EPO treatment in cancer
patients may increase the production of VEGF-C protein
in macrophages in lymph nodes, and this increased expression of VEGF-C may induce lymphangiogenesis. Thus, EPO
can increase tumor lymph node metastasis through a direct
lymphaniogenic effect on LECs and indirectly via VEGF-C
production by macrophages.
In summary, our results reveal that systemic administration of EPO increases lymph node volume, axillary lymph
node diameter, lymph node tumor metastasis, and lymph
node lymphangiogenesis in a mouse model of a human
breast cancer xenograft and melanoma tumor model of
mice. EPO induces migration, capillary-like tube formation,
and proliferation of hLECs as well as lymphatic endothelial
sprouting via the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathway.

Peritoneal administration of EPO also induces lymphangiogenesis. EPO also increased VEGF-C expression in bone
marrow–derived macrophages. All of these data suggest
that EPO can be a new lymphangiogenic factor and that
EPO-induced lymphangiogenesis may be associated with
lymph node tumor metastasis.
