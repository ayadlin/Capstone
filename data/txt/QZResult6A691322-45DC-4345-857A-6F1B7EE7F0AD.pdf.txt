ABSTRACT
Acadesine is a nucleoside analogue with known activity against B-cell
malignancies. Herein, we showed that in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells acadesine
induced caspase-dependent apoptosis through turning on the mitochondrial apoptotic
machinery. At the molecular level, the compound triggered the activation of the
AMPK pathway, consequently modulating known downstream targets, such as mTOR
and the cell motility-related vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). VASP
phosphorylation by acadesine was concomitant with a blockade of CXCL12-induced
migration. The inhibition of the mTOR cascade by acadesine, committed MCL cells
to enter in apoptosis by a translational downregulation of the antiapoptotic Mcl1 protein. In contrast, Bcl-2 protein levels were unaffected by acadesine and MCL
samples expressing high levels of Bcl-2 tended to have a reduced response to the
drug. Targeting Bcl-2 with the selective BH3-mimetic agent ABT-199 sensitized Bcl2high MCL cells to acadesine. This effect was validated in vivo, where the combination
of both agents displayed a more marked inhibition of tumor outgrowth than each
drug alone. These findings support the notions that antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2
family regulate MCL cell sensitivity to acadesine and that the combination of this agent
with Bcl-2 inhibitors might be an interesting therapeutic option to treat MCL patients.

INTRODUCTION

the patient. Although these strategies have high initial
response rates, most patients relapse and die from diseaserelated complications [2]. Within this background, new
efforts in the identification of crucial biologic pathways
involved in cell survival and proliferation are leading
to the development of rational strategies targeting for
instance, the proteasome, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the
B-cell receptor signaling pathway, and the antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family of proteins [2, 3].
In cancer cells, adenosine monophosphate-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway is commonly
deregulated. AMPK is a highly conserved heterotrimeric
serine/threonine kinase that contributes to the control
of cell growth, proliferation and autophagy through the

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive
lymphoid neoplasia characterized by an abnormal
proliferation of mature B lymphocytes. It is genetically
characterized by the presence of the t(11;14)(q13;q32)
translocation causing cyclin D1 overexpression.
Additionally, several secondary genetic events contribute
to the development and aggressiveness of the disease.
Clinically, the prognosis of MCL is generally poor, being
among the worst of all B-cell lymphomas [1]. Current

downregulation of mTOR activity. AMPK acts as an energy
sensor that is activated in response to numerous stress
factors, such as hypoxia or glucose deprivation, linking
cellular metabolism and energy status to prosurvival
signaling pathways [4, 5]. Considering the integral role of
this pathway, targeting AMPK might represent a relevant
therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment [6-8]. In this
context, acadesine (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide1-D-ribofuranoside, AICA-riboside or AICAR), a
cell-permeable nucleoside analogue, is metabolically
converted by the cells to AICA ribotide (ZMP), which acts
as an AMP mimetic and triggers the AMPK activation [7].
Acadesine has been reported to mimic a low energy state
and mediate anticancer effects by different mechanisms,
which may depend on the bioenergetic status of the cells
[4, 9, 10]. Recent evidences in certain cancer models
indicated that acadesine might also inhibit proliferation,
independently of the AMPK pathway [11, 12]. In several
hematologic malignancies, acadesine has been shown to
induce selective apoptosis [13-17] and/or inhibition of
proliferation and cell cycle arrest [18, 19]. Furthermore,
due to the promising in vitro activity of acadesine in CLL
cells [13, 14], a phase I/II clinical trial was conducted in
relapsed/refractory CLL patients with an acceptable safety
profile, and showing that the compound might be effective
for the treatment of these patients [20]. Regarding MCL,
we previously reported that acadesine was cytotoxic for
MCL cells alone or in combination with rituximab [16].
However, the responses among the MCL samples were
heterogeneous and the molecular mechanisms implicated
in acadesine response were not fully characterized. In this
manuscript, we provide insight on the signaling pathways
implicated in the activity of the compound in MCL cells
and explore a rational combination with ABT-199 to
overcome acadesine resistance in MCL.

magnitude, acadesine concomitantly decreased the
mitochondrial membrane potential, activated the caspase-3
and increased the phospatidylserine exposure (Figure 1A).
On the contrary, when the caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh
was added, cells were rescued from caspase-3 activation
and phosphatidylserine exposure but not from the loss of
the mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating that
the apoptosis induced by the nucleoside analogue was
caspase-mediated (Figure 1A).
Given that in CLL cells acadesine-induced apoptosis
has been reported to be mediated by the up-regulation
of the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bim, Noxa and
Puma [15], we examined the levels of these proteins in
our model. MCL cell lines and primary MCL cells were
incubated with acadesine (2 mM) for 6 hours and BH3only proteins were analyzed by western blot. As shown
in Figure 1B, no upregulation of any of these proteins in
the samples studied was detected, suggesting a different
mechanism of apoptosis induction in MCL cells. As
previously reported, Bim expression was not detected in
JEKO-1 cells due to a homozygous deletion at BIM locus
[21].
Next, we verified whether acadesine was efficiently
activating AMPK in MCL cells, as seen in the majority
of cell types, including CLL [14]. For this purpose, we
assessed the levels of phosphorylation of the AMPK
substrate, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which is
phosphorylated upon AMPK activation [15]. Indeed, as
shown in Figure 1C, a 6-hour incubation with acadesine
induced ACC phosphorylation in all MCL samples,
indicating that acadesine activated the AMPK pathway.

Acadesine induces VASP phosphorylation
concomitantly to an inhibition of CXCL12induced chemotaxis and cytoskeleton organization

RESULTS

AMPK has been reported to regulate the
phosphorylation of the actin regulatory protein
vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) [22].
VASP phosphorylation results in inhibition of actin
polymerization, cell adhesion and migration [22, 23].
Gene expression profile studies from our group suggested
a potential role of acadesine in reducing the migration of
MCL cell lines [16]. In this context, we sought to explore
whether the inhibition of migration by acadesine could be
related to VASP phosphorylation.
First, we analyzed VASP phosphorylation levels
after acadesine (2 mM) exposure for 6 hours. JEKO-1,
HBL-2 as well as primary MCL cells showed an increase
in phosphorylation levels of VASP after acadesine
treatment (Figure 2A). In parallel, we performed actin
polymerization assays in the presence of CXCL12, to
study if the drug was also able to block this phenomenon.
CXCL12 stimulation increased actin polymerization
in MCL primary samples that peaked at 15 seconds. A

Acadesine induces apoptosis by a caspasedependent mechanism and activates AMPK
We previously reported that acadesine was able
to induce cytotoxicity in MCL cell lines and primary
MCL samples, although some differences in sensitivity
were observed among them [16]. With the aim to
provide further evidence on the cell death mechanism
triggered by the drug in these cells, we analyzed several
apoptotic hallmarks. JEKO-1 and HBL-2 cell lines,
with different sensitivity to the compound according to
our previous results [16], and 3 primary MCL samples
were incubated with acadesine (2 mM) for 24 hours
and mitochondrial depolarization, caspase-3 activation
and phosphatidylserine exposure were analyzed by flow
cytometry. In all the samples studied, although at different

significant inhibition of this process was observed with
acadesine incubation at 60 and 120 seconds (*P < 0.05;
Figure 2B).
Finally, we performed chemotaxis assays towards
CXCL12 stimulus to confirm acadesine effects on cell
migration in a set of 6 MCL primary samples. As shown
in Figure 2C, acadesine (2 mM) significantly blocked the
migration induced by stimulation with CXCL12 (*P <

mTOR is a well-known AMPK target that has
been involved in MCL pathogenesis [24]. To study
the modulation of this pathway by acadesine, we first
analyzed the phosphorylation status of several mTORrelated kinases after incubating MCL cells with acadesine
(2 mM). Western blot analysis revealed that short-time

incubation with acadesine was enough to inhibit the
mTOR translational activity, as shown by a decrease in
the phosphorylation levels of the mTOR downstream

kinase S6 ribosomal protein (p-S6rp) and the eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4E (p-eIF4E) both in MCL
cell lines and primary MCL samples (Figure 3A).

Bcl-2 expression confers resistance to acadesine

Simultaneously to mTOR inhibition, we found an
important reduction in the levels of the antiapoptotic
protein Mcl-1 (Figure 3A). Given that Mcl-1 is regulated
by mTOR at translational level [25], we hypothesized
that acadesine could decrease Mcl-1 levels by affecting
the AMPK/mTOR axis. To confirm that acadesine was
interfering with Mcl-1 translation, we then wanted
to discard other possible mechanisms explaining its
modification. We incubated two MCL cell lines with
acadesine and the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh to
analyze if Mcl-1 was degraded by caspases. As seen in
Figure 3B, acadesine reduced Mcl-1 levels even when
cells were treated with the caspase inhibitor, indicating that
acadesine-induced Mcl-1 downregulation was not caspasemediated. We next wanted to examine if acadesine was
affecting Mcl-1 stability. MCL cell lines were incubated
with acadesine before adding the protein synthesis
inhibitor cycloheximide. Cycloheximide addition did
not enhance the decrease of Mcl-1 protein levels upon
acadesine exposure, indicating that when translation was
blocked, acadesine did not increase Mcl-1 elimination
(Figure 3C). Finally, we monitored MCL1 mRNA levels by
qRT-PCR to analyze a possible transcriptional regulation
of MCL1 by acadesine treatment. Figure 3D shows that no
changes in the expression levels of MCL1 were detected
in JEKO-1 and HBL-2 cell lines after acadesine treatment
in any incubation time. Altogether these results suggested
that acadesine inhibits the Mcl-1 translation by affecting
the AMPK/mTOR pathway.

Because Mcl-1 was downregulated at the same
degree in all the samples, irrespective of the cytotoxic
response to acadesine, other mechanisms explaining
differences in acadesine-induced cytotoxicity were
explored. In addition to Mcl-1, the antiapoptotic proteins
Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL also play a role in the control of the
survival of MCL cells [26]. Therefore, we investigated
if the levels of these two proteins were altered after
acadesine treatment. As shown in Figure 4A, acadesine
treatment did not induce substantial changes in Bcl-2 and
Bcl-XL protein levels after 6-hour incubation in MCL
cell lines and primary MCL samples. Next, we evaluated
putative differences regarding the basal level of these
two antiapoptotic proteins in correlation with acadesine
sensitivity. For this aim, we quantified by western blot
the basal protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in a set of
9 MCL cell lines and analyzed the correlation with the
corresponding cytotoxic effect of acadesine (2 mM) at 24
hours of exposure (Table 1). Interestingly, we observed
that Bcl-2 protein levels inversely correlated with response
to acadesine (*P < 0.05), thus in Bcl-2high cell lines (HBL2 and GRANTA-519) acadesine was less effective (Figure
4B). In contrast, no significant association was observed
between Bcl-XL protein levels and acadesine sensitivity
(data not shown). Since significant association was found
between Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels (**P < 0.01),
the Bcl-2 correlation with sensitivity to acadesine was

antiapoptotic protein could sensitize Bcl-2high MCL cells
to acadesine. To prove our hypothesis, we treated Bcl2high MCL cells simultaneously with acadesine and the
BH3-mimetic ABT-199, which selectively inhibits Bcl-2
[27]. First, we tested the combination of both drugs in the
representative Bcl-2high cell line HBL-2 (Figure 5A). Low
doses of ABT-199 were able to sensitize this MCL cell
line to acadesine, with the combination reaching a similar
profile of sensitivity to the one observed for acadesine
alone in a Bcl-2low cell line (JEKO-1; Figure 1A). The

DISCUSSION

Our findings indicated that the downregulation of this
protein is neither transcriptional nor through enhanced
degradation, highlighting the direct connection between
mTOR inhibition and Mcl-1 downregulation. Supporting
this, other compounds that target mTOR pathway were
also described to inhibit Mcl-1 at a translational level in
lymphomas [44, 49, 50].
Our results showed that acadesine ultimately
activated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and caused
caspase-dependent cell death in MCL, in accordance
to what has been observed in CLL [14]. Activation of
apoptosis might be consequence of either upregulation
of the proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family or
downregulation of the antiapoptotic ones. [51]. In CLL,
acadesine-induced apoptosis is promoted by the BH3only proteins Bim, Puma or Noxa [15]. However, we
did not find upregulation of these factors in MCL cells,
suggesting a distinct mechanism of apoptosis activation. In
this context, the reduction of Mcl-1 induced by acadesine
exposure might account for MCL entrance in apoptosis,
similarly to what observed with other drugs [44, 52].
Nevertheless, although a similar reduction of Mcl-1
protein levels was observed among all the MCL cases, a
variable degree of cytotoxic response to acadesine was
distinguished, suggesting that other mechanisms might
influence acadesine-induced cell death. Remarkably, we
found that high BCL2 expression correlated with a reduced
response to acadesine in MCL cells. In line with this, B
lymphocytes in vav-BCL2 transgenic mice are highly
resistant to acadesine treatment [15] as well as primary
follicular lymphoma samples, which constitutively express
high levels of Bcl-2 due to the t(14;18) translocation [13].
BH3-mimetic drugs have emerged in order to
overcome the mechanisms of apoptosis resistance by
targeting Bcl-2 family of proteins. ABT-199 is the most
selective BH3 mimetic against Bcl-2, which specifically
binds to Bcl-2 but not to Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL [27]. The
compound has shown promising clinical activity in early
studies [3]. In hematological malignancies, including CLL
and MCL, ABT-199 induces apoptosis [53] and its activity
was found to directly correlate with Bcl-2 expression in
a set of lymphoma cell lines [27]. In this context, we
demonstrated that nanomolar doses of ABT-199 are able
to sensitize Bcl-2high MCL cells, to acadesine. This strategy
was also validated in vivo using a subcutaneous model of
the HBL-2 cell line, where the combination of acadesine
plus ABT-199 was more potent in reducing tumor growth
than each drug alone. Of note, the addition of low doses of
ABT-199 to acadesine was much less effective in Bcl-2low
MCL cell lines (data not shown), probably reflecting their
minor Bcl-2 dependency. Acadesine might also have a role
in resensitizing ABT-199 resistant cells. High levels of
Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL have been reported to be a mechanism
of both de novo [54] and acquired [55] resistance to
ABT-199 in lymphoma cell lines, which is overcome by
the addition of mTOR inhibitors [55], and possibly with

Acadesine has been shown to induce antitumor
activity in several cancer models, by affecting apoptosis
[28, 29], autophagy [30] or cell proliferation [10, 12,
17-19, 31]. In B-cell neoplasms the nucleoside analogue
has been extensively studied both in vitro [13, 14]
and in clinical trials [20]. Recently, we reported that
acadesine had an heterogeneous cytotoxic effect in a
wide range of MCL cell lines and primary samples alone
or in combination with rituximab [16]. In the present
manuscript we provide further insight on the molecular
mechanism of action of acadesine in MCL and explore
potential strategies to overcome acadesine-resistance.
We confirmed the activation of the AMPK pathway
by acadesine in MCL cells, as reported in other models
[6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 29]. AMPK has been found to be
inactivated in lymphoma [32, 33] and has specific roles in
many processes that critically impact tumor progression
[34]. One of such functions is to regulate cell migration
through VASP phosphorylation [22, 35]. VASP is an
actin binding phosphoprotein implicated in the control of
actin cytoskeleton elongation and cell migration [36-39],
whose phosphorylation at Ser239 impairs actin assembly
[22, 36, 37]. Consistently, we observed that in MCL cells,
acadesine triggered VASP phosphorylation at Ser239, as
well as blockade of actin polymerization and migration in
MCL cells. Chemokine signaling and adhesion processes
are regulating the trafficking of MCL cells, and their
homing and/or retention within tissue microenvironments.
Thus, therapeutic approaches disrupting these phenomena
are acquiring more relevance in MCL [40]. In vitro studies
demonstrated that several kinase inhibitors [41-44] as
well as the recently approved BTK inhibitor ibrutinib [45]
blocked these migratory and microenvironmental survival
signals. At the clinical setting, the inhibition of these
processes results in a mobilization of tumor cells from
the lymphoid tissues to the peripheral blood [45, 46]. In
accordance, a similar trend of mobilization was observed
in the phase I/II clinical trial conducted with acadesine
in relapsed/refractory CLL patients, where an increase in
the CLL counts in peripheral blood and a reduction of the
lymph node size was observed [20].
It is also well-known that AMPK regulates mTOR
signaling [4, 5, 8]. In MCL cells, where the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR survival pathway is constitutively activated
[24], AMPK activation results in an inhibition of the
mTOR cascade [47]. Herein, we confirmed that a short
incubation with acadesine efficiently inhibited the mTOR
translational activity in MCL cells, by dephosphorylation
of the mTOR downstream factors S6rp and eIF4E. This
decrease on phosphorylation was less evident by eIF4E
that might be due to the regulation of this protein by other
signaling pathways [48]. Furthermore, we demonstrated a
critical reduction in the levels of the antiapoptotic protein
Mcl-1 as a consequence of a blockade in its translation.

acadesine. Given that the majority of cancers, including
MCL, lack an “Achilles heel“, there is growing evidence
that combination therapies can control tumor growth more
efficiently [56].
Even though acadesine is a nucleoside analogue, its
antitumoral mechanistic effect differs from conventional
chemotherapeutic agents in MCL. Collectively, our
findings suggest that this drug modulates downstream
AMPK targets affecting MCL migration and inhibiting
the mTOR pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated both
in vitro and in vivo that acadesine resistance found in
Bcl-2high MCL samples might be overcome by targeting
Bcl-2 with ABT-199. These results indicate that acadesine
in combination of BH3-mimetics might represent a
promising therapeutic option to treat MCL patients.

cells for 4 hours with acadesine and then for 1 hour with
100 μM of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide
(Sigma). Cytotoxicity was analyzed by quantification
of phosphatidylserine exposure through double staining
with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and
propidium iodide (PI; Bender Medsystems). Changes in
mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm) and caspase-3
activation were evaluated by staining cells with 20 nM
3,3′-diexyloxacarbocyanine iodide or Cell Event TM
Caspase 3/7 (Life Technologies), respectively. Labeled
cells were analyzed on an Attune acoustic cytometer (Life
Technologies). CI values were calculated after exposure
of cells to increasing concentrations of acadesine and
ABT-199 using the Calcusyn software v2.0 (Biosoft).
The interaction between drugs was considered synergistic
when CI < 1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Western blot analysis

MCL cell lines and primary cultures

Whole-cell protein extracts were obtained by
lysing cells with Triton buffer (20 mM Tris-HCL
pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% Triton
X-100) supplemented with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (10 μg/mL leupeptin, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, 1
mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM NaF, and 2
mM Na3VO4; Sigma). Proteins were quantified by using
Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) and separated in 1015% SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P
membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked
with 2.5% phosphoBlocker Blocking Reagent (Cell
Biolabs) in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS)-Tween 20, and
probed with antibodies against: Puma (Abcam), Bim,
Noxa (Enzo life sciences), phosphorylated-Ser79 AAC
(p-ACC), ACC, phosphorylated-Ser239 VASP (p-VASP),
VASP, phosphorylated-Ser235/236 S6rp (p-S6rp), S6rp,
phosphorylated-Ser 209 eIF4E (p-eIF4E), eIF4E (Cell
Signalling Technology), Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). Antibody binding was detected
using secondary peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse (Sigma)
and anti-rabbit (Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies and
chemiluminiscence was detected using a mini-LAS4000
Fujifilm device (Fujifilm). Equal protein loading was
confirmed by probing membranes with α-tubulin antibody
(Sigma). Densitometric quantification was done by using
Image Gauge software (Fujifilm).

Nine human MCL cell lines (GRANTA-519, JVM2, JEKO-1, Z-138, MAVER-1, REC-1, UPN-1, HBL-2
and MINO; Table 1) were cultured with RPMI-1640 or
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) medium
complemented with 10-20% heat-inactivated FBS, 2
mM L-glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin
(Life Technologies). Cells were grown in a humidified
atmosphere at 37Cº with 5% carbon dioxide and routinely
tested for Mycoplasma absence by PCR. Additionally, the
genetic identity of all cell lines was periodically verified
using the AmpFISTR identifier kit (Life Technologies).
Genetic characterization of these MCL cell lines has
been previously reported [44]. Primary MCL cells were
obtained from peripheral blood samples of MCL patients
diagnosed according to the WHO criteria. The ethical
approval for this project, including the informed consent
of the patients, was granted following the guidelines of
the Hospital Clínic Ethics Committee (IRB). Biological
characteristics of these cases are shown in Table 1.
Tumor cells were isolated by centrifugation on a FicollHypaque (GE Healthcare) gradient and conserved within
the Hematopathology collection registered at the Biobanc
from Hospital Clínic-IDIBAPS (R121004-094). Cells
were cultured in supplemented RPMI as above.

Actin polymerization assay

Drugs and detection of apoptosis by flow
cytometry

MCL cells (107 cells/mL) were washed twice and
serum starved for 1.5 hours in FBS-free RPMI-1640.
Acadesine was added for 3 additional hours, and MCL
primary cells were diluted to 2 x 106 cells/mL in RPMI1640 with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma).
Thereafter, samples were stimulated with 200 ng/mL of
CXCL12 (Peprotech) and at the indicated time points,

Cells were incubated with acadesine (1 and 2 mM;
kindly provided by Advancell) and/or ABT-199 (0.5-2.5
nM; Selleck Chemicals) for the times specified. When
indicated, cells were preincubated for 1 hour with 10 μM
of the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh (Calbiochem).
Experiments of protein stability were done by incubating

100 μL of the cell suspension was collected and added
to 25 μL of the staining solution [2.5 ng/mL phalloidinTetramethyl Rhodamine Isothiocyanate (TRITC), 2.5
mg/mL of L-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (Sigma) and 5%
paraformaldehyde (Aname)] for 20 minutes at 37ºC. Cells
were acquired on an Attune cytometer, and results were
plotted relative to the mean fluorescence of the sample
before the addition of CXCL12.

4 cohorts of 4 each. Acadesine (400 mg/kg) or vehicle
were administered by intraperitoneal injection 5 days/
week. ABT-199 (15 mg/kg) diluted in 60% phosal 50 PG
(Lipoid), 30% poliethylenglicol and 10% ethanol (Sigma)
or vehicle were given orally at once a week. The shortest
and longest diameters of the tumor were measured with
external calipers twice a week and tumor volumes were
estimated using the following formula: (the shortest
diameter)2 x (the longest diameter) x 0.5. Mice were
sacrificed after 15 days of the treatment according to the
institutional guidelines.

Chemotaxis assay
MCL cells (107 cells/mL) were washed twice and
serum-starved for 1.5 hours in FBS-free RPMI. Acadesine
2 mM was added for 3 additional hours, and cells were
diluted to 5 x 106 cells/mL with 0.5% BSA in RPMI. One
hundred µL (5 x 105 cells) was added to the top chamber
of a transwell culture polycarbonate insert with 6.5 mm
diameter and 5 μm of pore size (Corning). Inserts had been
previously transferred to wells containing 600 μL of RPMI
with 0.5% BSA and 200 ng/mL of human recombinant
CXCL12. After 3 hours of incubation at 37°C, 100 μL
was collected in triplicate from each lower chamber and
counted in an Attune cytometer for 12 seconds under
constant flow rate. Migration levels of viable cells are
given taking the untreated cells without CXCL12 as
reference.

technical support. This work was carried out at the Esther
Koplowitz Center, Barcelona.

Data were depicted as the mean ± SEM of 3
independent experiments for cell lines or the mean ± SEM
for the MCL primary cases. All statistical analyses were
done by using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad
Software). Comparison of means between 2 groups of
samples was evaluated by nonparametric Mann-Whitney
test or Wilcoxon paired test. Correlations between two
continuous variables were done by a Sperman test. Results
were considered statistically significant when P < 0.05 (*,
P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01).
