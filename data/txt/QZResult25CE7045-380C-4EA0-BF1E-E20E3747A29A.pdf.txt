ABSTRACT
Objective: In this study, we evaluate the frequency of HER-2 and HER-3
expression in liver metastases from patients with colorectal cancer (CRLM). We
analyzed the potential of HER-2 and HER-3 as therapeutic targets and evaluated
their prognostic value.
Patients and Methods: Overall 208 patients with CRLM were enrolled. HER-2 and
HER-3 expression were determined in metastatic tissue of diagnostic punch biopsies
(n = 29) or resection specimens (n = 179). The results of immunohistochemistry
(IHC) scoring and In-situ-hybridization (ISH)-amplification were correlated with
clinical parameters and for the 179 resected patients with cancer-specific (CSS) and
overall survival (OS). The mean follow-up time was 56.7 months.
Results: Positivity of HER-2 status (IHC score 2+/ISH+ and IHC 3+) was
found in 8.2% of CRLM. High expression of HER-3 (IHC score 2+ and IHC 3+) was
detected in 75.0% of liver metastases. CSS after liver surgery was determined and
was independent from the HER-2 status (p = 0.963); however HER-3 was prognostic
with a favorable course for patients showing an overexpression of HER-3 (p = 0.037).
Conclusions: HER-2 overexpression occurs in only 8% of patients with CRLM but
with 75% of cases HER-3 is frequently overexpressed in CRLM. Therefore, HER-2 and
particularly HER-3 could serve as novel targets to be addressed within multimodal
treatment approaches.

radiotherapy (CRT) has led to an reduction of local
recurrences, the introduction of total mesorectal excision
(TME) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU and
oxaliplatin [5] and complete mesocolic excision (CME)
as well as the availability of new biological substances in
the last two decades are aiming to improve prognosis of
patients with (metastatic) CRC [6][7][8].
However, the occurrence of distant metastases
limits the prognosis of these patients. Rates up to 30–50%

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
cancer in the United States and also the third leading cause
of cancer related deaths [1]. High incidence rates of CRC
are reported mainly in developed countries with a Western
culture including the United States, Australia, New Zealand,
Canada and Western Europe [2][3][4]. The implementation
of multimodal therapy including preoperative chemo­

followed by the lung. Besides Radiofrequency ablation
(RFA) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
histopathologically confirmed R0 resection in potentially
curative intent is a favorable option in case of technical
resectability. Due to technical progress in liver surgery
and access to innovative treatment approaches, the
prognosis of patients with colorectal liver metastases has
dramatically improved [9]. Data on survival vary, but
about 17–32% of patients qualify for surgical resection
of liver metastases [10][11], leading to 5-year overall
survival (OS) rates ranging from 32–33% [11][12] to up
to 58% [13] and 10-year OS rates of about 18% [11].
For those patients, whose metastases remain
surgically unresectable and who are treated with
chemotherapy (CTx) alone, median survival rates are
currently reported with 13.9 - 17.4 months [14][15].
In the last decades, metastatic CRC has been treated
with Fluoropyrimidine-based CTx and recently in the
combination with irinotecan or oxaliplatin. Due to nonspecificity of this treatment, there have been major
initiatives in targeted therapy of CRC using antibody
based products such as cetuximab. In several studies
including recent data from the CELIM trial, it has been
demonstrated that initially unresectable colorectal liver
metastases can be resected after response to cetuximab
based CTx leading to a better overall survival of these
patients [16][17]. Patients who respond to conversion
therapy and undergo secondary surgery achieve a better
median OS of 53.9 months compared to those who do not
(21.9 months; p < 0.001) [16]. Still, the evaluation of new
agents targeting molecular pathways that are expressed
strongly by tumor cells is crucial to develop innovative
treatment approaches.
In this context we evaluated the transmembrane
receptor HER-2, a family member of the epidermal growth
factor receptor family (EGFR). HER-2 is already known as
a prognostic biomarker in various solid tumors (for more
than a decade in breast cancer [18][19], more recently
for gastric cancer [20], esophageal adenocarcinoma [21],
pancreatic [22] and rectal cancer [23]) and even more
importantly as a potential target in the specific tumor
therapy in clinical routine for breast and metastatic
gastric cancer. Data on the prognostic value of HER-2 in
GI-malignancies still remains less clear. The ToGA-trial
showed a HER-2 positivity of 22.1% [20][24] in gastric
cancer and adenocarcinoma of the gastro-esophageal
junction (overall n = 584 HER-2 positive) using a specific
modified immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring algorithm
in comparison to breast cancer [20][25]. Patients with
overexpression of HER-2 (IHC 3+, IHC 2+/FISH+) had a
better survival compared to patients with no or weak HER-2
expression levels (IHC 0, IHC 1+, IHC 2+/FISH-). These
patients treated with trastuzumab additionally to standard
CTx benefited significantly from the individualized
therapy [20]. Comparable studies using the same IHC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

scoring criteria showed a HER-2 positivity of 17% in
adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and of 27% in resection
specimens of patients with cUICC-II/-III rectal cancer [21]
[23]. Both studies demonstrated the correlation of a high
HER-2 expression with better survival in gastrointestinal
cancer. On the contrary, in breast cancer HER-2 positivity
seems to be associated with a higher occurrence of brain
metastases and reduced survival.
In several published meta-analyses it has been
shown that HER-2 overexpression was correlated with
decreased survival in CRC patients suggesting that HER-2
overexpression might not be a prognostic indicator [26]
[27]. In metastatic CRC, Aprile et al. [28] reported a
negative prognostic value of HER-2 expression in brain
metastases.
In this study we evaluate the frequency of HER-2
positivity in CRLM and in a very small subgroup of
patients also in corresponding primary tumor resection
specimens. Furthermore we analyzed if HER-2 could
be a prognostic biomarker or could, when being
overexpressed, in the future serve as a therapeutic target.
In addition, we assessed the expression of the EGFR
family member HER-3 whose role in metastatic CRC
has not been fully analyzed and is not understood yet. A
recent publication showed a HER-3 expression in about
70% of primary tumors of stage II and III CRC and in
about 75% of corresponding lymph node metastases
[29]. High expression of HER-3 was even assessed with
worse clinical outcome. So HER-3 could remain as an
independent (from post-resection therapy) prognostic
factor for distant metastases [29][30] and could even be
targeted specifically by a therapeutic antibody [31].

RESULTS
HER-2 status in liver metastases and
corresponding primary tumors
Positive HER-2 status (IHC 2+/ISH+ and IHC 3+)
was detected in 8.2% (17/208) of CRLM and in 18.2%
(4/22) of the very small subgroup of patients with a
resection specimens in primary tumors (Table 3). DualISH was performed in 46 specimens (33 metastases and
13 primary tumors) classified IHC 2+, to determine gene
amplification. About 75% of tissue specimens revealed
heterogeneous or focal expression (≤ 30% of HER-2
positive cancer cells) of HER-2. Positivity of HER-2 status
was found in 6% of synchronous metastases and in 11%
of the metachronous metastases (Table 1). Furthermore,
HER-2 was in trend more often overexpressed in
metastases of colon cancer (n = 8; 12.1%) compared to
metastases of rectal adenocarcinomas (n = 9; 6.3%).
Within the 22 matched paired samples, 4 primary
cancer samples and 2 CRLM samples showed HER-2
overexpression but in none of these cases the matched

in 75.0% samples (n = 156) of CRLM and in 72.7% of
the primary tumors (n = 16) (Table 3). Heterogeneity or

DISCUSSION
HER-2 and HER-3 are members of the EGFR
superfamily and involved in central molecular pathways
(PI3K/AKT and MAPK) in pathogenesis of solid tumors
[32]. HER-2 dimerizes preferentially with the HER-3
receptor initiating potential signal transduction leading

to cell proliferation, angiogenesis and formation of
metastases [33]. Several studies have reported varying
expression levels of HER-2 and HER-3 and evaluated
their correlation with clinico-pathological parameters
and prognosis but with divergent results [23][28][29][34]
[35]. Still, in a variety of solid tumors, the HER-2 receptor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

represents an effective target for monoclonal antibodies
such as trastuzumab being approved for metastatic gastric
cancer, pertuzumab [36] or antibody-drug-conjugates
such as T-DM-1 [37] and for small tyrosine kinase
inhibitors like lapatinib [38] and afatinib [39]. Besides,

target. Anti-HER-3 antibodies such as MM-121 (http://
ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01451632), RG7116 (http://
ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01482377) and U3-1287 [40] are
currently being tested in several clinical trials spanning
various patient populations including CRC patients. In
metastatic CRC, data about significance of HER-2 and
HER-3 overexpression is lacking. Therefore, we aimed to
evaluate the expression pattern of HER-2 as well as HER3 in CRLM to explore their possible prognostic values and
verify if they could serve as potential targets in patients
with metastatic CRC.
In the present analysis, high HER-3 expression
was detected in 75% of CRLM and in 73% of resection
specimens of primary tumors in CRC patients. Even though
several studies assessed cytoplasmatic [41][42][43] rather
than membranous staining pattern for the HER-3 receptor, we
considered membranous immunostaining of the tumor cells
only according to manufacturer’s instructions. HER-3 stained
tissue samples were similar to the HER-2 staining pattern
and were characterized by distinct heterogeneity or focal
expression (75% of tissue specimens had ≤30% of HER-2/
HER-3 positive cancer cells) as observed in previously
published studies in gastrointestinal cancer [20][23]. The
frequency of exclusive membrane staining of HER-3 were
also reported in studies on primary tumors in CRC patients
by Ledel et al. [29] (n = 236) and in colon cancer patients by
Beji et al. [34] (n = 110). Similar to our data, Ledel et al. [29]
showed a high HER-3 expression in 70% of primary tumors
and in 75% in corresponding CRC lymph node metastases.
In previous studies the HER-3 expression had prognostic
implications however with ambiguous findings regarding the
clinical outcome [29][34][44][45].
In line with several studies of CRC patients [26]
[27], we did not find a prognostic benefit for patients with
a positive HER-2 status or any correlation between positive
HER-2 status and clinico-pathological parameters. As
demonstrated in our preliminary studies [23], high HER-2
expression was found mainly in primary tumors in rectal
cancer patients (n = 4; 18.2%). The rate of HER-2 positivity
in metastases was 8% analogous to findings from Aprile
et al.[28] (n = 50) with HER-2 overexpression in 12% of
brain metastases. Furthermore, similarly high levels of
concordance were reported for metastases and corresponding
primary tumors in CRC patients [28][46]. However, the
change from positive HER-2 status in primary tumors to
HER-2 negative status in metastases was detected in about
20% (n = 4) of cases. Although this result is limited due to
the small amount of assessed primary tumors, this downregulation of HER-2 might be induced by multimodal
treatment, as described for breast cancer [47][48] or is an
effect of metastatic progression. Therefore, representative
slides of the resected tumor rather than metastases may be
adequate to evaluate the HER-2 status as a potential target
for a specific treatment. Nevertheless, targeting HER-2,
HER-3 and other EGFR members simultaneously could have
useful applications in metastastic CRC treatment. Although
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

trastuzumab is approved for HER-2 positive metastatic
gastric cancer, clinical trials on trastuzumab therapy for
(metastatic) CRC are still lacking. In CRC, data reported
that a HER-2 overexpression is also involved in response
to anti-EGFR therapies. Bertotti et al. [49] identified in
vitro the HER-2 overexpression and gene amplification to
be a negative determinant in addition to KRAS mutation
for response to an anti-EGFR therapy like cetuximab in
metastatic CRC. Dual inhibition with anti-EGFR antibodies
(cetuximab or pertuzumab) and anti-HER-2 antibody
(tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib) led in preclinical studies
to a significant regression of the tumor (-75%) in comparison
to treatment with cetuximab or lapatinib alone. Further
analyses and clinical phase II studies are also consistent with
these results (DUX study) [50][51] and showed increased
survival and response rates and even doubled progressionfree time with dual inhibition versus single antibody therapy.
In cancers with ligand-dependent activation of
HER-3, several studies suggest therapeutic potential of
anti-HER-3 substances [31][43][52]. Scartozzi et al. [43]
showed that HER-3 proved to be a predictive factor for
clinical outcome in wild-type KRAS CRC patients treated
with cetuximab. Currently, a clinical study evaluates
treatment with MM-121 plus cetuximab versus MM121 in combination with cetuximab plus irinotecan in
CRC (http://ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01451632). Another
multicenter study is recruiting participants to evaluate
RG7116 alone (part A) or in combination with cetuximab
(part B) or erlotinib (part C) in patients with metastatic
and/or locally advanced malignant HER-3 positive solid
tumors (http://ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01482377). The
results remain to be awaited.
In conclusion, HER-2 is detectable in a relevant
proportion and HER-3 is highly overexpressed in liver
metastases of patients with CRC (HER-2 8%; HER-3
75%). In patients with overexpression of HER-2 and/ or
HER-3 with tumor progression and metastatic spread,
targeting these two receptors may hypothetically be
beneficial. The HERACLES phase II trial demonstrated
with first results that the combination of trastuzumab and
lapatinib was effective in standard therapy refractory
mCRCs with HER-2 amplification [53]. Prospective
clinical trials will be necessary to validate HER-2 and
HER-3 as potential targets for precision medicine in the
treatment of (metastatic) CRC.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
This monocentric study included 208 patients (median
age: 67.5 years; 71 female (34%) and 137 male (66%))
with CRLM, treated between April 1982 and January
2013 at the Department of General, Visceral and Pediatric
Surgery, University Medical Center Göttingen, Germany.
The patients’ demographics and clinical characteristics are
summarized in Table 1. Patients were eligible if they had
CRC along with the occurrence of either synchronous or

metachronous liver metastases. Additional screening tests
(e. g. CT scan of the abdomen/thorax/brain, bone
scintigraphy) were performed to detect signs of extrahepatic
tumor manifestations and to verify if CRLM were resectable.
Distant metastases were mainly localized
exclusively in the liver (n = 117; 56%), followed by
metastases detected simultaneously in various organ
systems (liver, lungs, peritoneal, bones and/or brain; n =
91, 44%). Most patients presented with lesions in one lobe
(n = 105; 50%) or in two lobes of the liver (n = 89; 43%).
A total amount of 118 patients (57%) were diagnosed
UICC (Union International Contre le Cancer) stage
IV with synchronous metastases (Table 1), while in 90
patients (43%) distant metastases occurred within further
course of the disease (metachronous metastases). Mostly
the primary tumor was located in the rectum (n = 142;
68%). In 66 patients (32%) it was localized in the colon.
Overall, about 98% of the primary tumors were surgically
removed. Only 5 patients (2%) had surgery in palliative
intention due to an extraorgan extension of CRC and
extended findings intraoperatively.

staining of HER-3 are shown in Figure 2.
For the evaluation of HER-2 and HER-3 we used
the testing protocol, which had been developed within
the ToGA-trial and is now well established to determine
HER-2 expression and amplification in patients with
adenocarcinomas of the stomach and the gastroesophageal
junction [20][54] and which was used in primary rectal
adenocarcinomas before [23].
Scoring criteria included the magnification rule,
which allowed an objective and standardized evaluation
(Figure 1). The stained tissue samples were classified
according to their staining intensity regarding certain
magnification in the light microscope. Tumor cells were
assessed positive if they had only distinct, regularly
striped intercellular membrane staining. The circularity
of membrane staining was not a prerequisite for a
positive membrane staining. Due to a lack of luminal
receptors situated in intestinal glands basolateral or
lateral membrane stainings were also taken into account.
Cytoplasmic, nuclear or granular staining that may
occur among other cases of intestinal metaplasia was not
included [25].
Tumor samples were considered IHC 2+ or IHC 3+,
if at least 10% of the tumor cells had medium (10x, 20x
magnified, IHC 2+) or strong membrane staining at low
magnification (2.5x, 5x, IHC 3+). No membrane staining
was scored IHC 0 and weak membrane staining in at
least 10% of the tumor cells was defined as IHC 1+ (40x
magnified).
HER-2 samples scored IHC 2+ were further
prepared for detection of gene amplification using Dual-insitu-hybridization (Dual-ISH). In HER-3 stained samples
no assessment of gene amplification had been performed
(Figure 1).

Treatment - surgery and chemotherapy
In this study, 179 (86%) patients underwent liver
surgery including major (n = 102; 57%) or minor (n = 77;
43%) resection of the liver for resectable metastases
(Supplementary Table 1). Resectability was assessed by
experienced liver surgeons and was determined by the number
of metastases, size and account of lesions, the patients’
constitution and comorbidity and risk of further damage with
fatal outcome (e.g. hepatitis, hepatic failure). Major surgery
involved resection of four or more liver segments such as
(extended) hemihepatectomy whereas in minor surgery only
one or up to three liver segments were resected.
Perioperative combination CTx protocols varied
in accordance to patients’ tumor genetic profile such
as KRAS-status. Patients with a KRAS wild-typ
status received the monoclonal antibody cetuximab
simultaneously to CTx protocols with doublets
(n = 25; 12%; Supplementary Table 1). Bevacizumab,
a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), was applied to 24
patients (12%). In 6 patients (3%), the application
of cetuximab additionally to bevacizumab had been
performed. One patient received an additional third
antibody panitumumab, a humanized monoclonal
antibody against epidermal growth factor (EGF).

Dual-ISH protocol
Dual-ISH was performed in HER-2 cases with
equivocal membrane staining (if scored IHC 2+)
according to manufactures recommendations by using
the Ventana INFORM HER-2 Dual ISH/DNA Probe
Cocktail and visualized utilizing two-color chromogenic
in situ hybridization (ultraVIEW SISH Detection KIT and
ultraVIEW Red ISH DIG Detection Kit, Ventana Medical
Systems, Mannheim, Germany). HER-2 gene amplification

Immunhistochemistry protocol
The HER-2 status and HER-3 expression level were
determined in 208 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
tissue samples from hepatic CRC metastases. In addition
22 HER-2 stained resection specimens could also be
included in this study, so that 22 matched pairs of CRLM

was determined by the count of visualized copies of the
HER-2 gene and visualized copies of chromosome 17.
Ratios above 2.0 were considered amplified. IHC 3+ or
IHC 2+/Dual-ISH positive (amplified) were classified HER2 positive; IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/Dual-ISH negative
(not amplified) were defined HER-2 negative [23]. IHC and
Dual-ISH analyses were performed independently by two
different observers (HS and IN).

The association of HER-2 and HER-3 expression
levels with other clinico-pathological parameters was
assessed using Fisher’s exact test. Survival rates were
supplied by means of Kaplan-Meier analysis and tested
using the Cox proportional hazards model. Overall
survival (OS) was defined as interval between surgery of
the metastasis and death of any cause and cancer-specific
survival (CSS) was defined as time from surgery of the
metastasis and cancer related death. The p-value was
set to p < 0.05 to be considered statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were conducted using R statistical
computing environment version 3.1.1 [55]. Survival
analysis was performed using the R package survival.
