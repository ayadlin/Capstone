ABSTRACT
Normalization of the tumor microenvironment by selectively targeting
components of the tumor extracellular matrix has been recently proposed to have
the potential to decompress tumor blood vessels, increase vessel perfusion and
thus, improve drug delivery and the efficacy of cancer therapy. Therefore, we now
need to identify safe and well tolerated pharmaceutical agents that are able to
remodel the microenvironment of solid tumors and enhance chemotherapy. In this
study, we repurposed Pirfenidone, a clinically approved anti-fibrotic drug for the
treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, to investigate its possible role on tumor
microenvironment normalization. Using two orthotopic mammary tumor models we
demonstrate that Pirfenidone reduces collagen and hyaluronan levels and, as a result,
significantly increases blood vessel functionality and perfusion and improves the antitumor efficacy of doxorubicin. Reduction of extracellular matrix components were
mediated via TGFβ signaling pathway inhibition due to downregulation of TGFβ1,
COL1A1, COL3A1, HAS2, HAS3 expression levels. Our findings provide evidence that
repurposing Pirfenidone could be used as a promising strategy to enhance drug
delivery to solid tumors by normalizing the tumor microenvironment.

INTRODUCTION

the tumor ECM has been proposed to have the potential
to alleviate mechanical forces, decompress tumor vessels
and improve perfusion [7–10]. As a result drug delivery
and therapeutic outcomes are improved. Specifically, it
was shown that treatment with PEGPH20, a PEGylated
human recombinant hyaluronidase, decreased hyaluronan
levels in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumors in vivo,
causing an increase in vessel diameter and functional
vessel density and thus, resulting in the improvement in
drug delivery and treatment efficacy [11, 12]. Moreover,
depletion of collagen and/or hyaluronan by repurposing
the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan (Cozaar®, Merck
& Co., Inc), or using the monoclonal antibody 1D11,
an inhibitor of TGF-β signaling pathway, improved the
delivery of therapeutics in vivo by inducing blood vessel
decompression and improving perfusion in a variety of
breast and pancreatic tumors in mice [2, 13, 14]. From
the above mentioned agents, only losartan is clinically
approved, as an anti-hypertensive drug, and based on

Current chemotherapeutic agents, in sufficient
concentrations, are potent enough to kill cancer cells.
Nonetheless, failure of standard chemotherapies for
the treatment of desmoplastic cancers (e.g. breast and
pancreatic cancers) is in large part due to the fact that
these drugs are unable to reach cancer cells in amounts
sufficient to cause complete cure [1]. In these tumors,
blood vessels are compressed and sometimes collapsed,
drastically reducing perfusion and resulting in insufficient
delivery of any blood-borne therapeutic agent [2–4].
Desmoplastic tumors are characterized by an abnormally
dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and vessel compression
is an effect of mechanical forces developed within the
tumor due to uncontrolled cancer cell proliferation that
strains the ECM of the tumor microenvironment [5, 6].

preclinical findings [2], a phase II trial using losartan
and FOLFIRINOX has been initiated for the treatment
of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDACs) patients
(clinicaltrials.org identifier NCT01821729). Additionally,
a phase III trial of PEGPH20 combined with nabpaclitaxel plus gemcitabine has been recently started
for patients suffering from PDACs (clinicaltrials.org
identifier NCT02715804). Given the promise of such
combinatorial treatments to improve cancer therapy,
we need to identify clinically approved pharmaceutical
agents, other than losartan, that can be used in order to
improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs and may
be added to cancer patients’ treatment regimen. In this
notion, we hypothesized that Pirfenidone, an anti-fibrotic
drug could be repurposed to alleviate mechanical forces
in solid tumors and thus, improve delivery and efficacy of
common anti-cancer drugs.
Pirfenidone [5-methyl-1-2-[1H]-pyridone] is an
anti-fibrotic drug, commonly used for the treatment of
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It was first approved in
Japan under the trade name Pirespa® and some years
later in Europe, United States and Canada under the trade
name Esbriet® (Roche Pharmaceuticals) for the same cure.
A few studies using either in vitro experiments or animal
models have shown that Pirfenidone inhibits fibrosis
by downregulation of the TGFβ signaling pathway and
collagen synthesis [15–17]. However, to date, no studies
have analyzed the effects of Pirfenidone on remodeling
the tumor ECM to improve the delivery and efficacy of
cancer therapeutics. To investigate this, we employed two
orthotopic breast cancer mouse models: a xenograft model
using the human MCF10CA1a cell line and a syngeneic
model using the 4T1 murine mammary adenocarcinoma
cell line. We demonstrate that Pirfenidone normalizes
the tumor ECM and as a result significantly reduces
mechanical forces, decompresses tumor vessels, improves
perfusion, and enhances the efficacy of doxorubicin in
breast tumors. We further show that this effect is due to the
reduction of collagen and hyaluronan tumor components
as a result of TGFβ signaling pathway inhibition and
downregulation of collagen I (COL1A1), collagen 3
(COL3), hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), hyaluronan
synthase 3 (HAS3) and transforming growth factor-beta 1
(TGFβ1) gene expression.

basis at doses of 350, 500 and 600 mg/kg respectively
[17], starting 4 days post-implantation of cancer cells
in the mammary fat pad for a period of 33 days. First,
we observed that treatment with Pirfenidone had no
effect on tumor growth compared to control at all doses
(Supplementary Figure 1). Histological analysis with
immunofluorescence staining of tumor sections showed
that while treatment with 350 mg/kg Pirfenidone had
no significant effect on ECM tumor content compared
to tumors from control mice that received sterile
water, increased Pirfenidone concentrations at 500 and
650 mg/kg, significantly decreased collagen and
hyaluronan levels (Figure 1A, 1B). Interestingly, we found
that this reduction was the greatest for both components
at the dose of 500 mg/kg as confirmed by area fraction
quantification (Figure 1E, 1F). The area fraction of collagen
and hyaluronan for the 500 mg/kg Pirfenidone-treated
tumors was reduced by ~50%, whereas in 650 mg/kg
-treated animals it was decreased by ~30%, compared to
control-treated mice. Moreover, fibronectin at 500 mg/kg
Pirfenidone-treated tumors was reduced by ~20%
(Supplementary Figure 2). In order to examine the effect
of ECM reduction on the functionality of tumor blood
vessels, we first calculated the percentage of perfused
blood vessels of control and Pirfenidone-treated tumors
as well as the vessel diameter. Tumor tissue cryosections
from all groups were stained with antibodies against the
endothelial marker CD31 and biotinylated lectin, which
specifically marks the functional tumor vessels [2] (Figure
1C, 1D). The fraction of perfused vessels was calculated
based on the ratio of the number of biotinylated lectin
positive (+) to the number of CD31 positive (+) vessels.
We measured no significant change in tumor perfusion in
samples treated with 350mg/kg Pirfenidone. In contrast,
in tumors isolated from mice treated with 500 mg/kg
and 600 mg/kg Pirfenidone, we observed a statistically
significant increase in perfusion. Interestingly, the fraction
of perfused vessels was increased by more than 3-fold in
both groups compared to control (Figure 1H). Consistent
with these findings, calculation of vessel diameters in
these tumors indicated that tumors treated with 500 and
650 mg/kg Pirfenidone had a statistically significant
increased vessel diameter, suggesting that improved tumor
perfusion is an effect of vessel decompression (Figure 1G).
Despite the fact that we observed relatively small increases
in vessel diameter, these findings are in agreement with
previous studies showing that even small increases in
vessel diameter can significantly improve blood flow
[2, 5]. Moreover, quantification of CD31 staining between
different groups showed that Pirfenidone treatment did
not affect the total number of blood vessels (Figure 1I),
suggesting that Pirfenidone can improve perfusion without
affecting tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, measurements
of the interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and the elastic
modulus of the tumors (Supplementary Figure 3) showed
that even though tumors became softer for both 500 and

RESULTS
Pirfenidone normalizes the tumor
microenvironment by reducing collagen and
hyaluronan levels in a dose-depended manner
To investigate the dose-dependent effects of
Pirfenidone on tumor ECM, we initially developed an
orthotopic xenograft mouse model for breast cancer using
the human MCF10CA1a breast cancer cell line. Three
groups of mice received Pirfenidone orally on a daily

Pirfenidone alleviates solid and fluid stresses in
MCF10CA1a and 4T1 breast tumors

650 mg/kg Pirfenidone, only for the 500 mg/kg dose, IFP
was significantly decreased.
Taken together, these data indicate that the dose
of 500 mg/kg Pirfenidone is the optimal to induce
normalization of the tumor microenvironment and
therefore was selected for the subsequent analyses. The
notion that Pirfenidone dose of 500 mg/kg show stronger
effects than 650 mg/kg Pirfenidone could be due to
nonspecific target effects at higher doses.

Improved perfusion via reduction of the tumor
ECM and decompression of tumor blood vessels has been
attributed to alleviation of intratumoral solid stresses,
i.e., the forces originated from the solid phase of a tumor.
Furthermore, delivery of drugs can be improved not only
by increasing perfusion, which brings a larger volume
of blood carrying the drug into the tumor, but also by
alleviation of the IFP which increases the amount of drug
that is transferred across the tumor vessel walls from
the vascular to the interstitial space of the tumor [18].
Therefore, we carried out experiments to measure whether
treatment with Pirfenidone affected solid stress and IFP.
For the solid stress measurement, we performed two
experiments: we employed the tumor opening experiment
[5] to measure the solid stress that remains in the tissue
when the tumor is excised and the stress-strain experiment
to measure the elastic modulus of the tumors. For the
tumor opening experiment, upon excision the tumors
were cut along their longest axis at approximately 80% of
their thickness and then they were allowed to relax for 10
min. Owing to the solid stresses that remain in the tumor
even though it has been removed from the mouse, cutting
of the tumor results in the swelling of the interior of the
tumor and opening at the periphery. After the tumor opens
we measured the distance between the two hemispheres
(Figure 3A). Pirfenidone-induced reduction of the ECM
decreased tumor opening, which is indicative of alleviation
of solid stresses (Figure 3C) and also reduced the elastic
modulus of both tumor types, making the tumors less stiff
and thus, reducing their capacity to develop high stresses
(Figure 3B, 3D). These data suggest that treatment with
Pirfenidone decreased solid stresses in both MCF10CA1a
and 4T1 tumor models. Moreover, we tested the effect of
Pirfenidone on the hydraulic conductivity (Figure 3B, 3E)
and IFP (Figure 3F) of the tumors. Hydraulic conductivity
describes the ease by which interstitial fluid percolates
through the pores of the tumor interstitial space
(Figure 3B). Low hydraulic conductivity hinders fluid flow
through the pores of the tumor interstitial space, which
results in accumulation of interstitial fluid, which in turn
raises IFP. For hydraulic conductivity calculations, we
performed ex vivo stress-relaxation experiments where
the tumor sample is placed between two platens, it is
compressed and held to a constant compression so that the
interstitial fluid will equilibrate and some of it will exit
the tissue (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure 5). The
fluid equilibration (or relaxation) time is indicative of the
hydraulic conductivity, the faster the tissue equilibrates
the higher its conductivity will be. Pirfenidone-treated
tumors showed an increased hydraulic conductivity in
both preclinical tumor models (Figure 3E). Furthermore,
Pirfenidone significantly decreased IFP in both tumor
models (Figure 3F). In conclusion, our data show that

Pirfenidone decreases the levels of ECM
components and increases blood vessel
functionality in a syngeneic 4T1 breast tumor
model
Next, we wanted to confirm these effective
changes on tumor microenvironment and tumor blood
vessel functionality caused by Pirfenidone in another
orthotopic breast tumor model. For this set of experiments
we employed a syngeneic model using mouse 4T1
breast cancer cells implanted in BALB/C mice. Daily
administration of 500 mg/kg Pirfenidone caused no
significant reduction of collagen content (Figure 2A) but
hyaluronan levels were dramatically reduced compared to
the control group (Figure 2B). This was confirmed by area
fraction quantification for both collagen (Figure 2E) and
hyaluronan (Figure 2F). Despite the fact that there was
no difference in collagen levels between the control and
Pirfenidone-treated tumors, hyaluronan area fraction was
reduced by almost 50%. Furthermore, Pirfenidone reduced
significantly fibronectin levels (Supplementary Figure 2).
Since there was no effect on collagen in 4T1
tumors, it was interesting to examine the possible
action of Pirfenidone on myofibroblast-like cells.
We performed immunofluorescence staining for the
positive myofibroblast-like cells using the alpha-smooth
muscle actin (a-sma) antibody. We found that there was
no reduction on its expression in Pirfenidone-treated
tumors compared to controls (Supplementary Figure 4)
indicating that in our study Pirfenidone is not acting on
myofibroblast-like cells. Moreover, in order to examine
the effect of ECM reduction on the functionality of
tumor blood vessels, we calculated the percentage of
perfused blood vessels. Tissue cryosections were stained
with antibodies against or CD31 and biotinylated lectin
(Figure 2C, 2D). Again, the fraction of perfused vessels
was calculated based on the ratio of the number of
biotinylated lectin positive (+) to the CD31 positive (+)
vessels. Importantly, there was a significant increase
in tumor perfusion in Pirfenidone-treated samples
compared to controls by 60%, which was associated with
decompression of tumor blood vessels (Figure 2G, 2H).
Finally, the total area of vessels (CD31+ area) remained
unaffected (Figure 2D, 2I), suggesting that Pirfenidone,
at the selected dose of 500 mg/kg, did not affect tumor
angiogenesis.

Doxorubicin concentration in tissue sample homogenates
was determined by quantification of fluorescence intensity
(Ex.: 470 nm, Em: 590 nm) and calculated based on a
standard curve generated by addition and measurement
of known amounts of doxorubicin to normal tissue
homogenates of non-treated animals. A significant increase
in the delivery of doxorubicin in Pirfenidone-treated
tumors, by approximately 50%, was observed compared
to the control group without causing any effects to the
delivery of the drug to normal tissues (Figure 4).

using human-specific primers showed that Pirfenidone
suppressed collagen I (COL1A1), hyaluronan synthase
2 (HAS2), hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3), collagen 3
(COL3A1), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFβ1),
and fibronectin (FN1) gene expression in breast cancer
cells (Figure 6).

To correlate enhanced delivery of chemotherapy to
treatment efficacy, we performed tumor growth studies
using both the MCF10CA1a and 4T1 tumor models.
In these studies, doxorubicin and Pirfenidone were
administered either alone or in combination and the
tumor volume was measured throughout the treatment
period. Administration of 500 mg/kg Pirfenidone in both
MCF10CA1a and 4T1 tumor models did not influence
primary tumour growth. Similarly, 4 mg/kg doxorubicin,
for MCF10CA1a tumors, or 5 mg/kg doxorubicin for the
4T1 tumors, (i.p.) had no effect on tumor growth in either
animal model. However, combinatorial treatment using
both Pirfenidone and doxorubicin resulted in a significant
delay in tumor growth in both models (Figure  5).
Therefore, Pirfenidone-induced normalization of tumor
ECM can improve the efficacy of chemotherapy.

DISCUSSION
Despite the crucial role that mechanical forces play
in the delivery of drugs to solid tumors, it was only recently
that the contribution of tumor ECM on the development
of these forces and the compression of tumor blood
vessels was elucidated [5]. Collagen, given its ability to
resist to tensile loads, and hyaluronan that swells, owing
to its high negative charges, can generate forces large
enough to compress fragile intratumoral blood vessels
thus, dramatically reducing tumor perfusion. This effect is
more evident in desmoplastic tumors, such as breast and
pancreatic cancers that are rich in these ECM components.
Hypo-perfusion and the resulting reduction in drug delivery
might explain, in large part, the low survival rates of patients
with these tumor types. In the current study, we explored
the hypothesis that normalization of the tumor ECM by
repurposing Pirfenidone, an approved anti-fibrotic drug,
can alleviate mechanical forces, decompress tumor blood
vessels, restore blood vessel functionality and enhance
therapeutic outcomes. We confirmed our hypothesis using
two orthotopic breast tumor models. Interestingly, in both
tumor models chemotherapy alone did not affect tumor
growth but when combined with Pirfenidone it caused a
significant delay in tumor progression. Recent studies
have also shown that Pirfenidone and doxorubicin can
synergistically reduce breast tumor progression by targeting
tumor fibrosis indirectly via depletion of cancer associated

Pirfenidone downregulates the expression of
genes involved in remodeling of the ECM
Based on our histological analysis we concluded
that Pirfenidone normalizes the tumor microenvironment
by targeting collagen and/or hyaluronan. According to
previous studies regarding the Pirfenidone mode of action,
we hypothesized that a possible pathway responsible
for this effect could be the TGFβ signaling pathway. To
elucidate the possible mechanism, we performed realtime PCR gene expression analysis of critical genes that
are involved in collagen and hyaluronan synthesis as well
as others encoding for extracellular matrix components
or collagen crosslinking enzymes. RNA extraction from
human MCF10CA1a tumors followed by real-time PCR

normal tissues. Asterisk indicates statistically significant differences between compared groups (p < 0.05, n = 6).

fibroblasts (CAFs) [19]. In our study we demonstrated
that targeting the fibrotic ECM will in turn significantly
increase blood vessel functionality and perfusion and
thus, improve the anti-tumor efficacy of doxorubicin.
Moreover, pancreatic cancers are highly desmoplastic
and it has been shown that normalization of the tumor
microenvironment improves overall survival in preclinical

models of pancreatic tumors [2, 20]. Therefore, Pirfenidone
could be repurposed to improve chemotherapy in these
tumor types. Given the fact that both the anti-fibrotic agent
and the cytotoxic drug have been clinically approved, our
findings are highly transferable to the clinic and could lead
to clinical trials to test the efficacy of this combinatorial
treatment in human patients.

Animal tumor models and treatment protocols

Apart from targeting the tumor ECM, normalization
of the tumor microenvironment can be also achieved by
targeting stromal cells. Inhibition of the Hedgehog cellular
signaling pathway with Saridegib to deplete cancerassociated fibroblasts in preclinical pancreatic tumor
models has proved to effectively alleviate mechanical
forces and improve vessel functionality and efficacy of
chemotherapy [5, 21]. This drug, however, recently failed
in a phase II clinical trial for pancreatic cancer patients
when combined with gemcitabine, presumably due to
intrinsic resistance to gemcitabine by these tumors [22].
Furthermore, recent studies have shown that genetic
inhibition of Hedgehog pathway accelerates rather than
delays tumor progression [23, 24]. We should notice,
however, that the mechanisms of action of genetic vs
pharmacologic depletion are different as genetic ablation
has a greater effect on stromal cell depletion and could
potentially destroy instead of normalizing the tumor
microenvironment.
Finally, one could argue that opening tumor blood
vessels could allow more metastatic cells to disseminate
from the primary tumor and increase formation of
metastases, which has been shown in a number of preclinical studies [25, 26]. We should consider that even
though blood vessel functionality is one of the means by
which cancer cells are able to metastasize, the creation
of a harsh hypoxic microenvironment—owing to hypoperfusion—is a main cause that forces cancer cells to
metastasize. Therefore, restoration of tumor perfusion
via ECM remodeling can normalize oxygen levels and
might reduce the invasive and metastatic potential of
cancer cells. Furthermore, drugs that decompress vessels
should be given simultaneously with cytotoxic drugs so
that improved perfusion to be associated with increased
cancer cell killing.

Orthotopic xenograft breast tumor models were
generated by implantation of 5 × 105 MCF10CA1a
cells resuspended in 40 µl of serum-free medium
into the mammary fat pad of 6-week old female
CD1 nude immunodeficient mice. Orthotopic
syngeneic models for murine mammary tumors
were generated by implantation of 105 4T1 mouse
mammary cancer cells resuspended in 40 µl of serumfree medium into the mammary fat pad of 6-week old
BALB/c female mice. Pirfenidone was administered
orally once a day at different doses (350 mg/Kg,
500 mg/Kg or 650 mg/Kg as indicated) from day 4 postimplantation. Doxorubicin (4 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg for
the MCF10CA1a and 4T1 models, respectively) was
administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection from day
12 post-implantation, every 72 hours. During the course
of each experiment, tumor growth was monitored daily
and the planar dimensions (x, y) were measured using
a digital caliper. Tumor volume was calculated using
the volume of an ellipsoid and assuming that the third
dimension, z, is equal to x y . All in vivo experiments
were conducted in accordance with the animal welfare
regulations and guidelines of the Republic of Cyprus
and the European Union under a license acquired by the
Cyprus Veterinary Services (No CY/EXP/PR.L1/2014),
the Cyprus national authority for monitoring animal
research.
Before the end of each in vivo tumor growth
experiment, animals were anesthetized by i.p. injection
of Avertin (200 mg/kg) and interstitial fluid pressure
(IFP) was measure using the wick-in-needle technique
[5]. Next, 100 µl biotinylated lectin (1 mg/ml, Vector
Labs) was slowly administered in each mouse by
intracardiac injection and was allowed to distribute
throughout the body for 7 minutes. Finally, mice were
sacrificed via CO2 inhalation and tumors were excised
for mechanical, histological and gene expression
analysis in order to study modifications in the tumor
microenvironment.

avoid any bias, the analysis was performed automatically
using a previously developed in-house code in MATLAB
(MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) [5]. Five different
sections per tumor (from the interior and the periphery) at
×10 magnification were taken and analyzed.

synthesis was performed using reverse transcriptase III
(RT-III) enzyme and random hexamers (Invitrogen).
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was
performed using Sybr Fast Universal Master Mix (Kapa).
The human-specific primers that were used for gene
expression analysis are listed in Supplementary Table
1. All reactions were performed using a CFX-96 realtime PCR detection system (Biorad) and the following
conditions: 95°C for 2 min, 95°C for 2 sec, 60°C for
20 sec, 60°C for 1 sec, steps 2–4 for 39 cycles. Realtime PCR analysis and calculation of changes in gene
expression between compared groups was performed
using the ΔΔCt method.

Biomechanical analysis

Statistical analysis

Unconfined compression experiments were
carried out for the measurement of the elastic modulus
and the hydraulic conductivity of the tumors. For the
elastic modulus measurements, tumor specimens 3 × 3
× 2 mm (length × width × thickness) were loaded on a
high precision mechanical testing system (Instron, 5944,
Norwood, MA, USA) and compressed to a final strain
of 30% with a strain rate of 0.05mm/min, the minimum
rate the system can apply in order to avoid any transient,
poroelastic effects. The modulus was calculated from
the slope of the stress-strain curve between 20 and 30%
strain. For the calculation of the hydraulic conductivity,
stress relaxation experiments were performed in
unconfined compression. Specimens underwent four
cycles of testing for each of which a 5% compressive
strain was applied for 1 minute, followed by a 10 minute
hold. Subsequently, a common biphasic model of soft
tissue mechanics was employed [28] accounting for both
the solid phase (cells and extracellular matrix) and the
fluid phase (interstitial fluid) of the tumor. The hydraulic
conductivity was calculated by fitting the model to the
experimental data.

The data are presented as means with standard
errors. Groups were compared using Student’s t-test.

Biodistribution analysis

Authors’ contributions

For the biodistribution study, a dose of 9 mg/kg
of doxorubicin was administered via tail vein injection
to the animals 4 hours before sacrificing them. Six
animals per group were used (n = 6). The tissues were
excised from mice and were stored at −80°C until further
processing. For doxorubicin dosage and extraction, a
previously described protocol was employed [29]. More
details can be found in the Supplementary Materials
section.
