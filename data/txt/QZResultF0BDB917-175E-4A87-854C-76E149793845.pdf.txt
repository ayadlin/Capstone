ABSTRACT
Aims of this study were to investigate the ability of RACK1 pseudosubstrate alone
or in combination with classical immune stimuli to activate human leukocytes, and to
restore age-associated immune defects.
A total of 25 donors (17 old donors, 77–79 yrs; 8 young donors, 25–34 yrs) were
enrolled. To evaluate the effect of RACK1 pseudosubstrate on cytokine production
and CD86 expression the whole blood assay was used. Cultures were treated with
RACK1 pseudosubstrate in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or
phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and incubated for 24 h or 48 h for LPS-induced CD86
expression, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 production, and PHA-induced IL-4, IL-10, IFN-γ,
respectively. RACK1 pseudosubstrate alone induced IL-6, IL-8, and CD86 expression
in both young and old donors, and IFN-γ in old donors. In combination with LPS
an increase in IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α was observed, also resulting in restoration
of age-associated defective production, while no changes in the other parameters
investigated were found.
Even if based on a small sample size, these results suggest the possibility to
by-pass some of age-associated immune alterations, which may be beneficial in
situations were natural immune stimulation is required, and highlight a different
role of PKCβ in immune cells activation.

function, thereby, providing an explanation for the clinical
signs of immunosenescence [2–4].
In early studies aimed to characterize the molecular
mechanisms underlying immunosenescence, we identified a
defective protein kinase C (PKC) activation as a key player
in the reduced response to immune stimulation. Specifically,
we demonstrated that in the absence of a defect in total PKC
expression, the failing element in its activation was the
reduced expression of the Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1
(RACK1), which underlies functional impairment associated
with aging, including cytokine production, cell proliferation
[5–8], and response to influenza vaccination [9].
RACK1 is a 36-kDa protein that contains seven
WD-domain motifs and is related to G protein β subunits

INTRODUCTION
Developed countries are experiencing an unprece­
dented increase in life expectancy that is accompanied
by a rise in all age-associated problems, including
immunosenescence and immuno-related disorders.
Immunosenescence refers to the age-dependent changes
responsible for the poor immune response to infections
and the low efficacy of vaccination in elderly persons,
which contributes to the enhanced rate of mortality and
morbidity that are observed amongst the elderly [1].
Immunosenescence is characterized by a progressive
deterioration of innate and adaptive immune functions,
with immune cells displaying altered phenotype and

[10, 11]. RACK1 is a highly conserved intracellular
adaptor protein, which was originally identified as the
anchoring protein for activated protein kinase C [12, 13].
In the past 20 years, the number of binding partners and
validated cellular functions for RACK1 has increased,
which is helping to define the versatile role of RACK1 in
assembling and dismantling complex signaling pathways
from the cell membrane to the nucleus in health and
disease [14–16]. Relatively to PKC, RACK1 is able to
interact preferentially with PKCβII [12] and PKCε [13],
RACK1 modulates their activity by stabilizing their active
conformation and promotes their translocation close
to their specific substrates in order to activate defined
pathways [10, 11]. PKCs play a key regulatory role in a
variety of cellular functions, including cell growth and
differentiation, gene expression, hormone secretion, etc.
[17, 18]. Defective PKCβII translocation due to ageassociated RACK1 decline was described in different
immune cells [19, 20], in rat brain [21] and also in skin
cells [22]. More recently, investigating the role of RACK1
and PKCβ in chemical allergen-induced CD86 expression
and IL-8 production in the human promyelocytic cell
line THP-1 and primary human dendritic cells, we
demonstrated that a selective cell-permeable inhibitor of
PKCβ completely prevented chemical allergen or LPSinduced CD86 expression and significantly modulated
IL-8 production (50% reduction). Furthermore, the use
of a commercially available RACK1 pseudosubstrate,
consisting of a peptide derived from the C2 domain of
PKCβ designed to directly activate PKCβ and linked by
a disulfide bridge to the Antennapedia domain vector
peptide for a rapid cell uptake, resulted in dose-related
increase in CD86 expression and IL-8 production [23],
supporting a model where PKCβ activation is a key
component of the signal transduction pathways that induce
activation of dendritic cells.
Based on the important role of RACK1 and PKC in
cellular physiology and immune cells activation together
with its role in immunosenescence, the purpose of this study
was to investigate the ability of RACK1 pseudosubstrate
alone or in combination with classical immune stimuli 1)

to activate leukocytes obtained from healthy young and old
donors and 2) to restore some of the age-associated immune
defects. Results obtained demonstrate the possibility to bypass some of the age-associated immune alterations by
directly activating PKCβ, and overall highlight a different
role of PKCβ activation in cytokine production.

RESULTS
Costimulatory effects of RACK-1
pseudosubstrate on LPS-induced THP-1 cells
activation
We have recently demonstrated a role of PKCβ
and RACK1 in allergen-induced CD86 expression and
IL-8 production in both THP-1 cells and primary human
dendritic cells, supporting a central role of PKC-β in the
initiation of antigen-induced dendritic cells activation
[23]. To further support these findings, and to investigate
possible costimulatory effects of RACK1 pseudosubstrate,
we assessed its ability alone or in combination with LPS
to induce IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α production and CD86
expression in THP-1 cells. As shown in Table 1, RACK1
pseudosubstrate alone was able to induce IL-8 production
and CD86 expression, confirming previous results, while
at the concentration tested (2.5 μM) and time investigated
(24 h), RACK1 pseudosubstrate alone failed to induce
IL-6 or TNF-α production, suggesting that selective
activation of PKCβ is not sufficient for the production of
these cytokines. To study possible costimulatory effects,
a suboptimal concentration of LPS (10 ng/ml) was used
together with RACK1 pseudosubstrate. As expected, LPS
alone induced a significant increase in CD86 expression
and IL-8 production, while a modest production of IL-6
and TNF-α was observed, indicative of a suboptimal
concentration. The combination of LPS and RACK-1
pseudosubstrate was associated for all parameters
measured, with stastically significant higher production
compared to cells treated with LPS alone, indicative of a
costimulatory effect.

These results de facto inspired the subsequent
studies, the purpose of which was to evaluate in vitro the
immunostimulatory effects of RACK1 pseudosubstrate
using leukocytes obtained from young and old donors,
with the ultimate goal of assessing the possibility to
restore some of the immune deficiencies associated with
aging.

alone was able to induce IL-8 production (Figure 1B and
1F) and CD86 expression (Figure 2A and 2B) in both
young and old donors. Contrary to THP-1 and young
donors, in old donors RACK1 pseudosubstrate alone
also induced a statistically significant production of IL-6
(Figure 1E). In combination with LPS, a costimulatory
effect was observed for LPS-induced IL-8 (Figure 1B
and 1F) and IL-10 (Figure 1C and 1G) production in
both young and old donors, for TNF-α (Figure 1H) in old
donors and CD86 expression in young donors (Figure 2A).
No costimulatory effects were observed for LPS-induced
IL-6 production (Figure 1A and 1E). Importantly, in old
donors RACK1 pseudosubstrate was able to completely
restore LPS-induced IL-8 (Figure 1F) and IL-10 (Figure
1G), and partially restore TNF-α (Figure 1H) production,
which may be beneficial in situations were natural immune
stimulation is required.

Effects of RACK1 pseudosubstrate and LPS on
leukocytes obtained from young and old donors
A total of 25 healthy subjects, 17 elderly (77–79
years old, 7 women and 10 men) and 8 young (25–34 years
old, 4 women and 4 men), were enrolled. Blood samples
were taken on fasting early in the morning. In Table 2, the
absolute and percentage count of leukocytes are reported.
No statistically significant differences were observed
among leukocytes betweeen young and old donors. This
is important in light of the use of diluted whole-blood
cultures. As all functional assays are carried out using the
same amount of blood, it is essential to quantify both the
relative and the absolute numbers of white blood cells.
The use of whole blood may indeed mask some cytopenias
or excess of a cell type, which may lead to false data
interpretation.
Whereas studies using purified peripheral blood
mononuclear cells or cell lines have provided substantial
insight on mechanism underlying activation and cytokine
production, they may be limited in their scope because
they do not include all cell-cell or cell-protein interactions
that take place in vivo, the whole blood assay serves as a
useful bridge between in vivo situation and isolated cells
[28, 29]. The whole blood assay is an easy to perform in
vitro test that closely mimics the human situation. It is
faster and cheaper than the more established peripheral
blood mononuclear cell based assay, require less blood and
saves material since no isolation of cells is required [30,
31]. Consistently with our previous findings [7–9], aging
was associated with a decrease in LPS-induced TNF-α
production (Figure 1D and 1H, p < 0.01). In addition,
a statistically significant reduced LPS-induced IL-6
( p < 0.01), IL-8 ( p < 0.05) and IL-10 ( p < 0.01) production
was also observed in leukocytes obtained from old donors
compared to young donors (Figure 1). Consistently with
results obtained in THP-1 cells, RACK1 pseudosubstrate

Effects of RACK1 pseudosubstrate and PHA on
leukocytes obtained from young and old donors
In parallel, we explored the effect of RACK1
pseudosubstrate alone or in combination with PHA on
IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-γ production (Figure 3). Diluted
whole blood cultures were exposed for 48 h with
RACK1 pseudosubstrate alone or in combination with
PHA. Consistently with our previous findings [9], aging
was associated with an increase in PHA-induced IL10 production (Figure 3E, p < 0.01), while no change
in IFN-γ was observed (Figure 3B and 3F). In addition
to IL-10 and IFN-γ, we also measured the production
of IL-4 and no changes in the production or in the IFN-γ/
IL-4 ratio were observed in the two groups (Figure
3C, 3D and 3G, 3H). RACK1 pseudosubstrate alone
had no effect on IL-4, IL-10 or IFN-γ production in
leukocytes obtained from young donors (Figure 3A–3C),
while a modest but statistically significant increase in
IFN-γ production was observed in old donors at both
concentrations tested (Figure 3F), which is also reflected
in increased IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio in old donors (Figure 3H)
compared to young donors (Figure 3D). In combination
with PHA, the only relevant result was a significant
reduction in the production of IL-10 in response to
PHA in young donors (Figure 3A) and a similar trend in
the elderly but not statistically significant (Figure 3B),

indicative of a minor role of PKCβ in PHA-induced IL-4,
IL-10 and IFN-γ production.

production in response to LPS was significantly reduced
( p < 0.01) compared to young donors, but also IL-6,
IL-8 and IL-10 were significantly reduced as well,
indicating an overall reduction in monocyte activation.
Such defective cytokine production in response to
LPS, with the exception of IL-6, could be reversed by
RACK1 pseudosubstrate. RACK1 pseudosubstrate di­
rectly activating PKCβ can by-pass the age-associated
reduced RACK1 expression, and restore PKC-mediated
cell activation. The costimulatory effect of RACK1
pseudosubstrate on LPS-induced IL-6 production
observed in THP-1 cells could not be confirmed in primary
cells obtained from both young and old donors. Overall,
THP-1 cells are a good model to assess monocyte/
macrophage functions, but they do not completely reflect
the response of primary human cells. Concerning the
activation of T cells, RACK1 pseudosubstrate alone
had no effect on IL-4, IL-10 or IFN-γ production in
leukocytes obtained from young donors, while a modest
but statistically significant increase in IFN-γ production
was observed in old donors. In combination with PHA,
the only relevant result was a significant reduction in the
production of IL-10 in response to PHA in young donors.
A similar inhibitory effect on IL-10 production was also
observed using in the young donors anti CD3/CD28 as
stimuli (data not shown), no data are currently available
on old donors. A slight reduction in IL-10 production
was observed in the elderly, but it was not statistically
significant. The concentration of PHA was selected using
leukocytes obtained from young donors, in the case of
IL-10, where old donors produce much higher levels, a
lower concentration of PHA may be necessary to observe
a modulation. Further studies are clearly necessary to
characterize its specific role in T cell activation, including
proliferation and T cell migration. Overall, these results
are indicative of a minor role of PKCβ in PHA-induced
IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-γ production.
It is well known that PKCs play a key regulatory
role in a variety of cellular functions, including cell
growth and differentiation, gene expression, hormone
secretion, etc. [18–20, 34]; PKC family is the largest
serine/threonine-specific kinase family known to
comprise approximately 2% of the human kinome [35].
It is also clear that different PKCs are not functionally
redundant, for example specific PKCs mediate specific
cellular signals required for activation, proliferation,
differentiation and survival of immune cells [36–39], and
patterns of expression for each PKC isoform differ among
tissues [18]. Of the classical PKCs isoforms, only PKCβII was consistently activated during DC-differentiationinducing stimuli in normal and leukemic progenitors
[40]. PKC-βII activation by cytokines (GM-CSF + IL-4 +
TNF-α) in DC was demonstrated to be associated to upregulation of DC surface markers (MHCI and MHCII,
CD11c, CD40, CD80, CD86 and CD83), the induction
of expression of the NF-κB family member c-Rel, and

DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to investigate the
immunostimulatory effects of RACK1 pseudosubstrate
in primary human leukocytes, with the ultimate goal of
assessing the possibility to restore some of the immune
defects associated with aging. Results showed that the
direct activation of PKCβ using RACK1 pseudosubstrate,
alone or in combination with classical immune activators,
results in immune activation, as assessed by cytokine
production, and in the revertion of some of the ageassociated immune dysfuntions.
The concentrations of 1 and 2.5 μM of RACK1
pseudosubstrate were chosen from experiments in THP1 cells, where a clear dose response was observed [23].
For some of the parameters measured, using primary
leukocytes, we did not observe a clear dose response.
In particular we observed a better or similar stimulation
with 1 μM compared to 2.5 μM. We can speculate that
this maybe due to a different kinetic in the production of
cytokines in response to a different vigor in cell activation
following RACK pseudosubstrate stimulation or to donor
variability that may level the response, or to a saturation
in the ability of RACK1 pseudosubstrate to activate PKC
in fresh leukocytes compared to cell lines.
It is widely accepted that aging is characterized by a
pro-inflammatory imbalance termed ‘inflammaging’, with
increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α,
IL-1, IL-6), while increased anti-inflammatory cytokines
(IL-10, TGF-β) are possibly associated with more healthy
aging [32]. In a previous unpublished study conducted in
the same geographical area, which includes some of the
same donors enrolled in the current study, we found in the
elderly group increased serum levels of IL-1β (1.8 ± 1.9
pg/ml vs 0.3 ± 1.0 pg/ml of the young group, p < 0.001.
Results are expressed as mean ± SD, n = 20), TNF-α (23.9
± 19.2 pg/ml vs 13.2 ± 42.1 pg/ml, p < 0.001) and IL10 (3.1 ± 2.0 pg/ml vs 1.5 ± 2.9 pg/ml, p < 0.01), and
decreased levels of IL-1RA (69.4 ± 65.9 pg/ml vs 210.0 ±
800.0 pg/ml, p < 0.05), consistent with literature data. In
spite of this pro-inflammatory status, defective immune
cells activation is observed when cells obtained from old
donors are stimulated with classical immune activators
[33]. In previous studies, using the whole blood assay,
we found reduced TNF-α production in response to LPS,
increased IL-10 and no change in IFN-γ production in
response to PHA and decreased mitogen-induced T cell
proliferation, which correlated with reduced leukocyte
RACK1 expression [7–9]. No gender differences were
observed. In the current study, the defective response
to LPS was confirmed. Furthermore, not only TNF-α

the ability to stimulate allogeneic T cell proliferation.
Our findings support a model where PKCβ activation
is a key component of the signal transduction pathways
that induce CD86 up-regulation and IL-8 production in
monocyte/macrophage activation following exposure to
LPS. On the contrary its role in T cell activation seems
to be less prominent. This is consistent with data that
highlight a central role of other PKC isoforms, namely
PKCθ, PKCε and PKCα, in antigen receptor-mediated
T cell activation ex vivo and T cell-mediated immunity
in vivo [39]. In T cells, however, a role of PKCβ in T cell
locomotion has been demonstrated, where T cells crowling
has been shown to be associated with the translocation of
PKCβ to the microtubule cytoskeleton [41]. Alterations
in PKC expression and/or function may have important
implications in health and disease and warrants a detailed
investigation into the downstream target genes and the
underlying mechanisms involved [42–45]. Further work
is needed to identify mechanisms underlying PKCs
recruitment or exclusion, potential redundancy, and
relevance during immune cells activation.
With the limitation of being a small sample size study,
nevertheless our findings contribute to the understanding
of the mechanism underlying immunosenescence. The
significant results obtained, although with the need
of confirmation in larger cohort of subjects, open the
possibility to use the selective activation of specific
PKC isoforms to provide novel therapeutic strategies
to manipulate monocyte activation and to counteract
immunosenescence. As the effectiveness of vaccines is
reduced in older versus younger adults because of agerelated immunosenescence, the use of an adjuvant, such
as RACK1 pseudosubstrate, may represent a strategy that
may combat immunosenescence, potentially by boostering
dendritic cells activation and T-cell mediated responses,
resulting in a more effective response to vaccination.
Development of drugs that target the PKCβ pathway may
lead to novel therapeutic options for treating age-related
disease including immunosenescence.

supplemented with 10% heated-inactivated foetal calf
serum (media) and cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2 incubator.
To investigate the role of PKCβ in THP-1
activation, a pseudo RACK1 activator of protein
kinase C was used (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol UK).
The pseudosubstrate consists of a peptide derived from
the C2 domain of PKC-β (24) linked by a disulfide
bridge to the Antennapedia domain vector peptide. The
sequence of the peptide, as reported from the supplier, is:
KKWKMRRNQFWIKIQRC CSVEIWD* (Modifications:
disulfide bridge between 17–1*). The Antennapedia
peptide is actively taken up by intact cells, ensuring
rapid and effective uptake of the activator peptide [25].
Once inside the cell, the disulfide bonds are subjected to
reduction in the cytoplasm leading to production of the
activator peptide. Cells were treated with concentrations
and times specified in the legends.
To investigate the co-stimulatory effect of RACK1
pseudosubstrate, cells were treated simultaneously with
the pseudosubstrate in the presence or absence of LPS
(10 ng/ml).

METHODS

Preparation of whole blood cells and cytokine
production

Study population
In this study a total of 25 healthy subjects living
in the same geographical area of Northern Italy were
recruited. These subjects included 17 elderly subject
(age range 77–79; 7 women and 10 men) and 8 young
subjects (age range 25–34, 4 women and 4 men). All
elderly subjects were community dwelling, functionally
independent and participating to the InVeCe Ab population
based study [26]. Healthy subjects were selected according
to the guidelines of the Italian Health authorities and to
the Declaration of Helsinki principles and signed an
informed consent. Criteria for exclusion were the presence
of abnormal laboratory values (i.e. altered hemocrome) or
the use of medication known to affect the immune system,
i.e. steroids, or patients suffering from malignancies,
inflammations and infections.

Chemicals

Blood samples were taken by venous puncture with
sodium citrate 0.5 M as anticoagulant. Sodium citrate was
chosen instead of heparin or EDTA as anticoagulant, since
functional assays were performed using the whole blood
assay and heparin may be contaminated with endotoxin,
while EDTA interferes with cell activation. Blood samples
were diluted 1:10 in cell culture medium RPMI 1640
(Sigma, St Louis, USA) containing 2 mM L-glutamine,
0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin. Diluted
blood samples were treated in the presence or absence of
LPS at final concentration of 10 ng/ml or PHA 0.3 μg/ml
and incubated for 24 h or 48 h at 37°C in a humidified 5%
CO2 incubator for TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-4, IL-10

Lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli serotype
0127:B8 was obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO,
USA); phytohaemagglutinin was from Invitrogen (PHA,
Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). All reagents were purchased at
the highest purity available.

Experiments with THP-1 cells
THP-1 cells (Istituto Zooprofilattico di Brescia,
Italy) were diluted to 106 cells/mL in RPMI 1640
containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin,
100 IU/mL penicillin, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol,

and IFN-γ production, respectively. Owing to the variability
in stimulation assays, the same lot of each reagent was used
in all experimental cultures. The suboptimal concentration
of LPS and PHA were chosen in preliminary dose-response
experiments. The use of suboptimal concentrations allow to
highlight any costimulatory effects. Cell-free supernatants
obtained by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min were
stored at −20°C until measurement.

for THP-1 cells or 15 minutes for blood samples with
specific FITC-conjugates antibodies against CD86 (BD
Biosciences) or with isotype control antibody at room
temperature (BD Biosciences). 1 ml of PBS was then
added and cells centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min and
resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS supplemented with 1%
FCS and 0.1% NaN3. For the blood samples, after 24 h
of treatment, dliluted whole blood was centrifuged at 1500
rpm for 5 min and pellets resuspended in 100 μl of PBS
supplemented with 0.1% NaN3, 50 μl was stained in the
dark for 15 minutes with the specific antibodies or with
isotype control antibody at room temperature. 1 ml of
FACS lysing solution (BD Biosciences) was then added
and samples incubated for 10 min, then centrifuged
at 1200 rpm for 10 min and resuspended in 0.5 ml of
PBS supplemented with 0.1% NaN3. The intensity of
fluorescence and the percentage of positive cells were
analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and
data were quantified using CellQuest software (Becton
Dickinson). 10,000 viable cells were analyzed for mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) and percentage of positive
cells (PC). All experiments were performed in triplicate.
Changes in CD86 expression are reported as
stimulation index (SI) calculated by the following equation:

Summary sentence
Results demonstrate the possibility to by-pass some
of the age-associated immune alterations, and highlight a
different role of PKC-β in immune cells activation.

Abbreviations
IL- interleukin, IFN - interferon, LPS - lipopolysaccharide,
PHA - phytohaemagglutinin, RACK1 - receptor for activated
C kinase 1, TNF - tumor necrosis factor.
