and Michael J. Keating, MD

BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibodies may be used more effectively in combination. A previous study of intravenous
(iv) bolus alemtuzumab plus rituximab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) recurrence produced a
response rate of 54% after a 4-week treatment period. METHODS: To optimize dose, schedule, and route of alemtuzumab, a study was designed exploring continuous intravenous infusion (civ) followed by subcutaneous (sc) alemtuzumab together with weekly iv rituximab in patients with previously treated CLL. RESULTS: Data from 40 patients
with a median age of 59 years, and a median of 3 prior regimens (range, 1-8 regimens) were evaluable. Approximately
64% of patients were fludarabine-refractory. Seven patients (18%) achieved a complete response (CR), 4 (10%) a nodular partial response (nPR), and 10 (25%) a partial response for an overall response rate of 53%. Of 11 major responses
(CR, nPR), 8 occurred after cycle 1. Response rates were highest in blood (94%), followed by liver/spleen (82%),
bone marrow (68%), and lymph nodes (51%). The combination did not generate unexpected toxicities. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivations occurred in 6 patients (15%) and responded well to anti-CMV therapy. High titers of antiidiotype antibodies after sc alemtuzumab were demonstrated in 1 patient, but remained without clinical sequelae.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of civ/sc alemtuzumab plus rituximab has activity in some patients with recurrent/
refractory CLL and maximum response is achieved after 1 cycle (4 weeks) in 73% of patients. Further exploration in
other settings of CLL together with accompanying pharmacokinetic studies is recommended. Cancer 2010;116:2360–

KEYWORDS: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, monoclonal antibodies, alemtuzumab, rituximab.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent adult leukemia in the Western hemisphere. Although traditionally considered of an indolent nature, recent clinical research highlighted a remarkable heterogeneity of its clinical
course ranging from long-term survival without therapeutic intervention to fast-paced progression and early death.1 Therapy of CLL is nowadays frequently based on purine nucleoside-based combinations. However, none of the combinations
cure CLL and prognosis remains poor in patients with recurrent and refractory disease. Ongoing efforts to identify effective therapies therefore remain important.2
We and others have previously demonstrated the feasibility and safety of the monoclonal antibody combination of
alemtuzumab when given as an intravenous (iv) bolus infusion together with standard doses of iv rituximab for patients with
recurrent and refractory CLL.3 The rationale was based on combining the therapeutic strengths of each of the components
(eg, better activity of alemtuzumab in blood or bone marrow and of rituximab in lymph node sites) and thus benefit from
the additive activity. Although response rates were encouraging and generated interest in using alemtuzumab plus rituximab
combinations in other clinical settings such as frontline CLL and minimal residual disease (MRD), questions remained concerning the optimal dose, schedule, and route of alemtuzumab.4 We have combined iv rituximab with alemtuzumab starting

as a 6-day continuous iv infusion (civ) and followed by subcutaneous (sc) injections thereafter. The goal was to 1)
build up and maintain high levels of alemtuzumab in the
plasma, 2) saturate soluble CD52 (sCD52) binding sites,
and 3) improve patient tolerability.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group
Patients aged 15 years with chronic lymphoid malignancies who were either refractory to frontline therapy or had
developed disease recurrence after prior treatment, and
whose malignant cell population expressed both CD20
and CD52 in 20% of the cells by either flow cytometry
or immunohistochemistry were eligible. Expression of
CD20 or CD52 in <20% of analyzed cells was permissible if patients received rituximab or alemtuzumab, respectively, not longer than 3 months before start of the study.
Prior therapy with the combination of rituximab plus
alemtuzumab was not allowed. Additional eligibility criteria included 1) performance status 2 (Eastern Oncology
Cooperative Group [ECOG]), 2) adequate renal (serum
creatinine 2 mg/dL) and hepatic function (total serum
bilirubin 2 mg/dL), and 3) exclusion of patients with
active hepatitis B and at high-risk of hepatitis B infection.
All patients provided informed consent according to institutional guidelines. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center and was conducted in accordance
with the basic principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Treatment Plan
Patients received rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 iv on
Day 1, which was followed by a dose of 500 mg/m2 weekly
on the first day of each treatment week (ie, Days 8, 15, and
22). Alemtuzumab was initiated as a civ over 24 hours at a
dose of 30 mg/day for a total of 6 days (Days 2 to 7) followed by 30 mg sc twice a week on Days 3 and 5 of Weeks
2 to 4. Up to 3 courses could be administered. For patients
receiving a second or third course, rituximab was continued
at a dose of 500 mg/m2 weekly and alemtuzumab at a dose
of 30 mg sc twice weekly on Days 3 and 5 without a repeat
of the preceding 6-day civ phase. Treatment was administered in an outpatient setting. All patients received prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and valacyclovir (or
equivalent) for the duration of therapy and at least up to 3
months beyond the completion of the treatment. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia testing was performed
within 14 days before therapy and after the completion of

each cycle while the patient received treatment. Use of hematopoietic growth factors was permitted throughout therapy and was at the discretion of the treating physician.
All patients were assessed for toxicity and response.
Definition of response followed criteria as defined according to the National Cancer Institute Working Group
(NCI-WG) guidelines for CLL.5
Antiglobulin responses to alemtuzumab (anti-alemtuzumab antibodies) were measured in serum samples by
sandwich enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay as previously described.6 Samples were collected within 60 days
of the beginning of the study in patients with prior exposure to alemtuzumab and thereafter in all patients at the
end of the first cycle and 4 to 6 weeks after the last cycle.
All samples were processed and stored as specified by BioAnaLab Ltd. (Oxford, UK) and sent out in batches.
Statistical Analysis
The primary objective of the current study was to evaluate
the safety and efficacy of combining alemtuzumab when
given as a civ followed by sc injections with rituximab.
The primary measure of efficacy is the achievement of
response, classified as complete response (CR), partial
response (PR), and nodular partial response (nPR) and
determined according to established criteria.5
The trial was conducted in 2 stages and an interim
analysis was conducted after the first 20 patients. The
method of Bryant and Day was used to simultaneously
consider efficacy and toxicity outcomes. Based on historical data, an unacceptable response probability was defined
as 0.2, and an acceptable response probability as 0.4.
Severe toxicities were defined as severe prolonged myelosuppression, severe infectious complications, or grade 4
infusion-related toxicities. A probability of severe toxicity
of 0.4 was regarded as unacceptable, whereas a rate of 0.2
was acceptable for the regimen. Stopping boundaries for
efficacy and toxicity were established accordingly. Descriptive statistics was used to summarize patient characteristics and response data. Time to treatment failure
(time interval between the first treatment day to the first
sign of disease progression) and survival (time interval
between the first treatment until death from any cause)
was estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method.

patients who were not evaluable, 1 patient withdrew consent after registration and before any therapy, 3 patients
had to be taken off study after registration because they
were found to be ineligible (because of prior treatment
with the combination of alemtuzumab plus rituximab,
lack of expression of CD20, and positive serum markers
for hepatitis B virus, respectively), and 3 patients withdrew shortly after the initiation of treatment to continue
therapy off protocol and outside The University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. One patient had a diagnosis of marginal zone lymphoma/leukemia and has been
excluded from this analysis.
Response
Applying NCI-WG criteria for response assessment in
CLL, 7 patients (18%) achieved a CR, 4 (10%) an nPR,
and 10 patients (25%) achieved a PR, for an overall
response (OR) rate of 53%. The 1 patient with deletion of
chromosome 17p achieved a PR, but developed disease
progression soon thereafter so that he had to be taken off
study at the end of 2 cycles. Among the major responders
(CR, nPR), 8 responses occurred after 1 cycle, whereas in
3 patients 2 cycles were necessary. Comparing characteristics of the 11 major responders with the 19 nonresponders
demonstrated a higher number of male patients, a lower
number of previous regimens, fewer patients who have
previously received alemtuzumab, fewer patients with

advanced Rai stage, and lower levels of b-2 microglobulin
among the responders (Table 2). Thirteen patients were
taken off study because of disease progression, including 1
patient with Richter transformation. No patient died
while on study. Response by disease site is shown in Table
3. Response rates were highest in blood (94%), followed
by liver/spleen (82%), bone marrow (68%), and lymph
nodes (51%).
Time to treatment failure is shown in Figure 1. The
results are compared with a historical control of 36
patients with similar characteristics who received singleagent alemtuzumab on another treatment protocol and
41 patients from the previous combination study of alemtuzumab (iv) plus rituximab. The median time to treatment failure was 6 months (range, 1-34 months) for civ
followed by sc alemtuzumab plus rituximab and was virtually identical with both historical control groups (P ¼
.60). Overall survival of the major responders (patients
with CR and nPR) compared with the remainder of the
patients is shown in Figure 2. The median overall survival
was longer in the major responder group (62 months
[range, 1-73 months]) than for patients with a PR or no
responses (28 months [range, 1-72 months]; (P ¼ .01).
Toxicities and Infectious Complications
Adverse events were generally less than grade 3 and manageable with supportive care. Most frequent were fever
(28 patients; 68%), chills (25 patients; 61%), fatigue (21
patients; 51%), skin rashes (11 patients; 27%), nausea (10
patients; 24%), myalgias (10 patients; 24%), and diarrhea
(4 patients; 10%). They occurred mostly at the beginning
of the infusion part of the alemtuzumab administration,
but quickly subsided within a few days and did not recur
once patients moved on to the sc injections. One patient
developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). This
patient was heavily pretreated, had Rai stage 4 disease at

DISCUSSION
Monoclonal antibodies play a dominant role in the therapy of most patients with lymphoproliferative disorders,
including CLL. Combinations of nucleoside analog-based
chemotherapy with monoclonal antibodies (chemoimmunotherapy) have been highly active in CLL. Two
recent, large randomized trials have demonstrated that
chemoimmunotherapy results in superior response rates
and progression-free survival over chemotherapy alone.7,8
Alemtuzumab, a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig)G1
monoclonal antibody targeting the human CD52 antigen, has been approved for use in patients with CLL based
on 2 clinical studies in patients with refractory disease and
frontline patients, respectively.9,10 Monoclonal antibodies
directed against other target antigens have also demonstrated activity, most notably the anti-CD20–specific
monoclonal antibody rituximab.11 In a previous study,
we combined alemtuzumab with rituximab with the following rationale3: 1) responses after single-agent monoclonal antibody therapy are not durable and 2) the
activities of alemtuzumab and rituximab may complement each other. Alemtuzumab can effectively clear blood
and bone marrow lymphocytosis, whereas rituximab is
effective at reducing lymphadenopathy. Furthermore,
alemtuzumab demonstrated activity in patients with 17p
deletions and/or p53 mutations, both of which have been
associated with resistance to most other available CLL
treatment agents.12 The combination achieved an OR
rate of 54% in patients with recurrent and refractory

disease, but questions remained regarding the optimal
dose and schedule of the combination.
Administering alemtuzumab as a continuous infusion at the initiation of the treatment was aimed at rapidly
achieving high circulating antibody levels to saturate soluble CD52 binding sites.13 Subsequent dosing should then
allow maximum binding of alemtuzumab to cell-bound
(malignant lymphocytes, lymph nodes) CD52 and so
enhance its antitumor effect. We have recently published
results of a pilot study in which alemtuzumab was given
identically to the current study, but without rituximab.4
Two of 10 patients with fludarabine-refractory disease
achieved PR. Alemtuzumab plasma levels were measured
in 4 patients, 3 of whom demonstrated peak levels within
24 hours, which were sustained for at least 3 weeks. The sc
alemtuzumab is today more widely used in clinical practice than the iv formulation. In addition to the ease of
administration, its main advantage is the noticeably lower
incidence and severity of adverse events compared with iv
administration. Equally important is the question of
whether sc and iv routes achieve the same alemtuzumab
plasma levels, as blood concentrations have been correlated with response. This is indeed the case as demonstrated in a study from 2004.6 Highest measured blood
concentrations in 50 patients with CLL were similar after
iv or sc alemtuzumab, although the cumulative dose to
reach a defined level in the blood was higher with sc
administration.
In the current study, we reported an OR rate of
53%, including 18% complete responders. In a compari-

2364

son with the previous combination study, the OR rate and
time to treatment failure were similar, although there
appears to be a trend toward a higher CR rate (Table 4).3
However, subtle differences in the patient populations
between this and the previous alemtuzumab/rituximab
study may have influenced this comparison (eg, median
b-2 microglobulin levels were slightly higher in the previous study). The toxicity profile even during the civ phase
of alemtuzumab was more favorable without any new or
unexpected toxicities. We only reported 1 patient with
significant levels of alemtuzumab anti-idiotype antibodies, but no clinically apparent consequences. The levels
were detected before treatment and then persisted at least
for the duration of follow-up. In the study by Hale et al, 2
of 32 patients who were treated with sc alemtuzumab
developed clinically significant anti-idiotype responses.
None of the patients responded to therapy, and in both
cases, an exaggerated skin reaction was observed at the
alemtuzumab injection site. In their study, anti-idiotype
responses were detected up to 50 months after the treatment, whereas our measurements only extended to a few
weeks after therapy.
Although it has been a few years since we first published results of the combination of alemtuzumab plus rituximab in patients with CLL recurrence, interest in the
combination persists and extends into other groups of
patients. Frankfurt et al reported on 20 previously
untreated and symptomatic patients with CLL who
received alemtuzumab with rituximab administered sc.14
The median age of the group was 54 years. Approximately
75% achieved a CR, including all 5 patients with an 11qabnormality. Furthermore, at the completion of therapy,
14 patients (70%) had no evidence of MRD by flow
cytometry. Zent et al used the combination in untreated,
but asymptomatic, patients with CLL who had at least
1 marker of high-risk disease (17p13-, 11q22-, or

combination of unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain
variable and CD38þ/ZAP70þ).15 Twenty-seven (90%)
patients responded, with CRs occurring in 11 patients
(37%) and 5 of the CR patients without MRD. Further
development of the combination includes induction therapy for elderly patients and for the treatment of MRD.
Validation of our hypothesis of neutralizing soluble
CD52 antigen and optimization of binding to the tumor
target would help to substantiate the clinical experience
that the current study achieved higher complete remission
rates in patients with disease recurrence than the previous
dose and schedule.
