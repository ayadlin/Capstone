Abstract
Paclitaxel is a standard-of-care chemotherapy for breast cancer, despite the increasing recognition of its poor effectiveness
in the treatment of patients with advanced disease. Here, we
report that adenovirus-type 5 E1A-mediated elevation of the
miRNA-processing enzyme Dicer is sufﬁcient to enhance paclitaxel sensitization and reduce cancer stem-like cell properties
in this setting. Elevating Dicer expression increased levels of the
AXL kinase targeting miRNA miR-494, thereby repressing AXL

expression to increase paclitaxel sensitivity. We found that
Dicer expression was regulated at the transcription level by
E1A, through activation of an MAPK14/CEBPa pathway. Our
ﬁndings deﬁne a mechanism of E1A-mediated chemosensitization for paclitaxel, which is based upon the suppression of
breast cancer stem-like cells, with potential implications for
the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer patients. Cancer Res;

and in vivo (6, 7), and suppress breast cancer metastasis (8, 9).
Moreover, E1A induces chemosensitization for different categories
of anticancer drugs, including paclitaxel, gemcitabine, TRAIL, and
HDAC inhibitors (10–14), but it is unclear whether miRNAs and
miRNA-processing enzymes are involved in the E1A-mediated
chemosensitization to paclitaxel for breast cancer treatment.
Dicer, an RNase III endonuclease, is an essential enzyme in
miRNA biogenesis that regulates target gene expression, and
aberrant expressions of Dicer are associated with the clinical
outcomes of patients with various cancers (15, 16). Accumulating
studies have shown that downregulation of Dicer is associated
with cancer progression in breast cancer (17–20), hepatocellular
carcinoma (21), colon cancer (22), and ovarian cancer (23).
However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of Dicer regulation and chemotherapeutic sensitization in breast cancer are not
fully understood.
In this study, we found that Dicer expression was inversely
correlated with breast cancer progression in large cohorts of breast
cancer patients and identiﬁed transcriptional regulation of Dicer
by the E1A-mediated MAPK14/C/EBPa pathway. Furthermore,
we found that the elevated expression of Dicer by E1A increased
miR-494 expression and subsequently repressed AXL expression
and cancer stemness, resulting in an enhancement of paclitaxel
sensitivity in breast cancer cells.

Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer in
women and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in worldwide (1). Approximately 20% to 30% of breast cancer patients
present with locally advanced disease, and another 30% of patients
will develop recurrent or distant metastatic disease (2). Paclitaxel
has been widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment
of breast cancer and other cancers (3). However, for paclitaxel,
substantial toxic effects and a poor response of paclitaxel are still
major limitations of treatment in breast cancer (2, 4, 5). The
antitumor effects of the adenovirus type 5 E1A (E1A) gene induce
apoptosis in transformed cells and human cancer cell lines in vitro

Dicer Represses AXL and Elicits Paclitaxel Sensitization

Collection and Research Center and Center for Genomic Medicine, NCKU (Tainan, Taiwan) using an AmoFLSTR Identiﬁer PCR
Ampliﬁcation Kit (Applied Biosystems Cat.# 4322288) for the
analysis of 16 STR loci. All cells were frozen within 1 to 2 weeks
after authentication. MDA-MB-231, HS578t, MCF-7 and SKBR3
cells were grown in DMEM/F12. T47D, MDA-MB-361, and
HBL100 cells were grown in DMEM. The human breast cancer
cell line MDA-MB-231 and its E1A/vector-stable transfectants
have been described previously (9). The transfectants were grown
under the same conditions as the control, except that G418 was
added to the culture medium.
miRNA microarray hybridization
Total RNA (2.5 mg) obtained from MDA-MB-231/vector, MDAMB-231/E1A, and MDA-MB-231/E1A/shDicer cells was labeled
and hybridized on miRNA microarrays (using the Human miRNA
OneArray v2 (Phalanx Biotech Group). The arrays were designed
to detect the 1,087 unique miRNA probes from Human (miRBase
Release, http://www.mirbase.org/). These miRNAs that were signiﬁcantly upregulated or downregulated were analyzed by GenePix 4.1 software (Molecular Devices). All microarray data have
been submitted to GEO database, accession GSE76924.
Orthotopic breast tumor growth assay
Five-week-old female severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice
(NOD.CB17 Prkdcscid from National Laboratory Animal Center)
were orthotopically injected with 5  106 tumor cells into the
mammary fat pad and then randomly assigned to treatment
groups (n ¼ 8/group) with vehicle or paclitaxel. Paclitaxel was
administered at 20 mg/kg i.v. twice a week (24). Calipers were
used to measure tumor length (L) and width (W) every 3 days to
assess the primary tumor growth rates. Tumor volume was calculated with the formula LW2/2.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6 software.
The data from the in vitro experiments were approximately normally distributed and presented as the mean  SEM from at least
three independent experiments that were each performed in
triplicate. Statistical evaluation of the variance among the experimental groups was performed using a two-tailed Student t test for
comparisons between two groups. Differences with a P value of
less than 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Dicer expression is critical for E1A-mediated paclitaxel
sensitization and the suppression of stem-like cell properties
Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are involved in cancer stem
cell dysregulation and cell proliferation and in the drug resistance
of cancers as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Thus, molecularly
targeting miRNAs could be a potential strategy for targeted therapy and a novel therapeutic approach (25). To characterize the
alteration of miRNAs that are involved in E1A-mediated chemosensitization, we conducted an miRNA proﬁling analysis in MDAMB-231 cells that were stably transfected with control vector (231/
vector) or E1A (231/E1A) using an miRNA microarray. Differential expression of the global miRNAs in 231/vector and 231/E1A
cells is shown in a pie chart (Fig. 1A). The results of the array
analysis showed that 88% of the global miRNA level was upregulated, and 12% of that was downregulated in 231/E1A cells

www.aacrjournals.org

compared to 231/vector cells. To determine whether E1A could
increase global miRNA expression through the regulation of
miRNA processing, we examined the expression of several molecules that are involved in miRNA biogenesis, including Drosha,
Dicer, XPO5, TRBP, and Ago2, and found that the protein level of
Dicer signiﬁcantly increased in E1A-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). This
prompted us to consider whether alterations in Dicer expression
would be affected by chemosensitivity and the tumor progression
of breast cancer. We knocked down the expression of Dicer in
MCF-7, SKBR3, MDA-MB-361, and T47D breast cancer cells and
examined cell viability after paclitaxel treatment. The results
showed that reducing Dicer expression signiﬁcantly increased cell
viability after paclitaxel treatment compared with the control cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that the expression level of
Dicer plays a critical role in paclitaxel sensitivity of breast cancer
cells. We queried the PrognoScan and Oncomine databases to
analyze Dicer expression in patients with breast cancer and
observed that the expression level of Dicer negatively correlated
with cancer stem cell markers, including CD44, ALDHA1, KLF4,
SOX2, Nanog, and OCT4 expression (Supplementary Table S1).
Low Dicer expression was also inversely correlated with breast
cancer progression in a large cohort of breast cancer patients
(Supplementary Table S2) and was signiﬁcantly correlated with
worse survival and clinical outcomes (Supplementary Fig. S2).
To further investigate the role of Dicer in E1A-mediated chemosensitization and suppression of the stem-like cell properties
of breast cancer, we knocked down Dicer in E1A-transfected breast
cancer cells and found that E1A-mediated chemosensitization of
paclitaxel is signiﬁcantly abolished (Fig. 1C). Dicer-impaired
colon cancer cells have enhanced cancer stem cell features and
metastasis (22). Therefore, we examined whether the upregulation of Dicer by E1A created a shift in the pattern of expression of
breast cancer stem cell properties. As shown in Fig. 1D–F, in the
CD44high/CD24low population, ALDH activity and sphere formation of MDA-MB-231 cells were decreased in E1A-transfected cells
relative to the vector control cells; however, these effects were
signiﬁcantly reversed by knockdown of Dicer in E1A-transfected
cells. To determine the effect of Dicer on E1A-mediated chemosensitization in vivo, we examined paclitaxel sensitivity in an
orthotropic breast tumor growth assay. We orthotopically
implanted Dicer-knockdown 231/E1A or vector control cells into
the mammary fat pads of NOD/SCID mice and measured the
growth of the resulting primary tumors. Four weeks postimplantation, the tumor volume of the Dicer-knocked down 231/E1A
(231/E1A/shDicer) group with paclitaxel treatment was higher
than that of the 231/E1A group, suggesting that the suppression of
Dicer enhances tumor growth by abolishing E1A-mediated paclitaxel chemosensitization (Fig. 1G and H). In addition, high
levels of Dicer expression were associated with a better response to
docetaxel treatment in breast cancer patients, based on the Oncomine database (Fig. 1I). These results suggest that elevated Dicer
expression plays a critical role in E1A-mediated paclitaxel sensitization and suppression of stem cell phenotypes in breast cancer.
Previous studies have reported that E1A induces cell apoptosis
by interaction with Rb protein then upregulated E2F protein
expression (26–28). We also observed that E1A increased the
expression of E2F family (E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3) and E2Fsregulated genes in MDA-MB-231/E1A cells, but knockdown of
E2Fs in MDA-MB-231/E1A cells did not affect Dicer expression
(Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3D). However, reducing E2Fs expression in MDA-MB-231/E1A cells partially abolished E1A-induced

Dicer Represses AXL and Elicits Paclitaxel Sensitization

chemosensitization of paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. S3E–S3G).
To further conﬁrm whether E1A-mediated paclitaxel sensitization is
a combinational effect of Dicer and E2F pathway, we overexpress
E2F1 in MDA-MB-231/E1A/shDicer cells and found that E2F1 was
slightly re-sensitize MDA-MB-231/E1A/shDicer cells to paclitaxel
(Supplementary Fig. S3H and S3I). On the other hand, overexpression of Dicer, as well as E2F1, in MDA-MB-231/E1A/shE2F1 cells
signiﬁcantly increased paclitaxel-induced cell death (Supplementary Fig. S3J and S3K). More important, under the presence of E1A,
genetic suppression of Dicer did not alter the expression of E2F1
and vice versa (Supplementary Fig. S3H and S3J). These results
suggest that E1A-mediated chemosensitization of paclitaxel may
result from the combinational effect of Dicer and E2F pathways.
AXL is involved in Dicer-mediated paclitaxel sensitization and
cancer stemness suppression
AXL, which belongs to the TAM family of receptor tyrosine
kinases, is associated with cancer progression (29). E1A downregulates the expression of AXL, and this phenomenon is correlated with chemosensitization and the poor prognosis of patients
with breast cancer (30, 31). Therefore, we wondered whether AXL
is involved in Dicer-regulated chemosensitization and cancer
stem cell properties. As shown in Fig. 2A, ectopic expression of
E1A in MDA-MB-231, HS578t, and HBL100 cells increased the
expression of Dicer and signiﬁcantly decreased the expression of
AXL compared with those cells expressing the control vector.
Interestingly, we found that knockdown of Dicer in E1A-transfected cells rescued the expression of AXL (Fig. 2A).
To verify the role of AXL expression in paclitaxel sensitization,
the expression of AXL was knocked down in MDA-MB-231 and
HBL100 cells by transfection with speciﬁc shAXL plasmids. Compared with the shControl-transfected (shCtrl) cells, the shAXLtransfected cells showed an increase in paclitaxel-induced cell
death (Fig. 2B and C; Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B), indicating
that downregulation of AXL is important for chemosensitization
to paclitaxel in breast cancer cells. We also observed that the
expression level of AXL signiﬁcantly and positively correlated with
CD44, ALDHA1, KLF4, SOX2, Nanog, and OCT4 expression (Sup-

plementary Table S3) in invasive breast cancer carcinoma (Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4D), as shown in the Oncomine
datasets. In addition, we restored the amount of AXL in MDAMB-231/E1A and HBL100/E1A cells and found that overexpression of AXL in MDA-MB-231/E1A and HBL100/E1A cells significantly abolished E1A-induced sensitivity to paclitaxel (Fig. 2D
and E; Supplementary Fig. S4E and S4F) and increased cancer
stem cell properties (Fig. 2F and G), indicating that the expression
of AXL is important for E1A-mediated chemosensitization and
cancer stemness suppression. To further investigate whether suppression of AXL is involved in E1A-mediated Dicer-dependent
chemosensitization of paclitaxel, we knocked down the expression AXL in MDA-MB-231/E1A/shDicer cells and found that
knockdown of Dicer in MDA-MB-231/E1A cells (MDA-MB231/E1A/shDicer) substantially reduced paclitaxel-induced cell
death compared with MDA-MB-231/E1A cells; in contrast, knocking down AXL in MDA-MB-231/E1A/shDicer cells signiﬁcantly
reversed the effect of paclitaxel-induced cell death compared to
MDA-MB-231/E1A/shDicer cells (Fig. 2H and I). To ascertain
whether the Dicer–AXL pathway affects other chemotherapeutic
drugs, we knocked down Dicer in MCF7 cells and found that AXL
expression was increased and conferred an increased resistance to
doxorubicin, ﬂuorouracil, and cisplatin (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Furthermore, inhibition of AXL in MCF7/shDicer cells reduced
cell viability after these treatments (Supplementary Fig. S5). These
results suggest that inhibition of AXL by Dicer not only induced
paclitaxel sensitization but also enhanced the sensitivity of breast
cancer cells to doxorubicin, ﬂuorouracil and cisplatin. Using the
Oncomine datasets, we observed that the expression level of AXL
was inversely correlated with Dicer expression in patients with
breast cancer (Fig. 2J; Supplementary Table S4). Collectively, these
results suggest that upregulation of Dicer by E1A reduced AXL
expression and enhanced sensitization to paclitaxel in breast
cancer cells.
Dicer increases miR-494 expression to repress AXL expression
To explore the detailed mechanisms of Dicer downregulation
of AXL expression for chemosensitization to paclitaxel by E1A, we

conducted an miRNA proﬁling analysis in stable MDA-MB-231/
vector, MDA-MB-231/E1A, and MDA-MB-231/E1A/shDicer cells
and predicted several candidate miRNAs that may target AXL
using multiple databases, including miRWalk, TargetScan,
miRanda, and DIANAmT. Using a combination of miRNA prediction and miRNA microarray analysis, we found 7 candidate
miRNAs whose expression was signiﬁcantly upregulated in MDAMB-231/E1A cells compared with MDA-MB-231/vector cells but
downregulated in MDA-MB-231/E1A/shDicer cells compared
with MDA-MB-231/E1A cells. These candidates may be capable
of targeting AXL (Fig. 3A). Among the 7 candidate miRNAs, the
expression of miR-188-5p, miR-494-3p, and miR-7-1-3p were
signiﬁcantly increased in MDA-MB-231/E1A cells compared with
MDA-MB-231/vector cells but decreased in MDA-MB-231/E1A/
shDicer cells compared with MDA-MB-231/E1A cells, as determined using a qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3B). To further investigate
whether these 3 miRNAs would suppress the expression of AXL,
we transfected these miRNA mimics into MDA-MB-231/E1A/
shDicer cells. We found that restoration of miR-494 signiﬁcantly
reduced the expression of AXL and increased paclitaxel-induced
cell death in MDA-MB-231/E1A/shDicer cells (Fig. 3C). To examine whether miR-494 would target AXL, we constructed a luciferase reporter vector harboring the wild-type 30 -UTR of the AXL
mRNA (WT-30 -UTR) and a vector containing mismatches in the
predicted miR-494–binding site (MT-30 -UTR; Fig. 3D, top). We
transfected these vectors into HEK293T cells at different miRNAto-reporter ratios. Transfection of the miR-494 and WT-AXL-30 UTR plasmid, but not the MT-AXL-30 -UTR plasmid, resulted in
suppression of luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 3D, bottom). These results showed that miR-494 targets the
30 -UTR of AXL and downregulates AXL expression.
Moreover, the expression of miR-494–speciﬁc antagomiR and
anti-miR-494 signiﬁcantly reversed E1A-reduced AXL-30 -UTR
reporter activity (Fig. 3E), increased AXL expression (Fig. 3F) and
ALDH activity (Fig. 3G), and suppressed E1A-induced paclitaxel
chemosensitization (Fig. 3H) in MDA-MB-231/E1A cells, suggesting that increasing the level of miR-494 plays a crucial role in E1Amediated AXL suppression and paclitaxel sensitization of breast
cancer cells. In contrast, treatment of MDA-MB-231/E1A/shDicer
cells with the miR-494 mimic decreased AXL expression (Fig. 3I,
lane 4 vs. lane 3) and ALDH activity (Fig. 3J) and increased
paclitaxel-induced cell death (Fig. 3K). In addition, reoverexpression of AXL in MDA-MB-231/E1A/shDicer/miR-494 cells (Fig. 3I,
lane 5) abolished the effects of miR-494 on chemosensitization
and cancer stemness suppression. In addition, the effects of
miR-494 and AXL on paclitaxel sensitization were also observed
in MCF7, SKBR3, MDA-MB-361, and T47D breast cancer cells in
the absence of E1A (Fig. 4). Taken together, these data suggest that
the repression of AXL by Dicer-mediated miR-494 maturation is
required for paclitaxel sensitization of breast cancer cells.

cells with ectopic expression of E1A by using qRT-PCR (Fig. 5A),
and the luciferase reporter activity of the transcriptional regulation of the Dicer promoter was signiﬁcantly increased by E1A (Fig.
5B, F1). These results showed that the transcriptional level of Dicer
was upregulated by E1A; thus, we explored the regulatory mechanism of the transcriptional regulation of the Dicer gene using
serial Dicer promoter–reporter deletion constructs (F1–F5; Fig.
5B). The shortest construct to respond to E1A expression was
between F2 and F3, and we subsequently searched for E1Aregulated response elements using TESS 2.0/TFSEARCH software.
We found 4 candidate response elements in this region, namely,
SP1-, GATA1-, C/EBPa-, and POU2F1-binding elements (Fig.
5C). We investigated which of these response elements are
involved in regulating Dicer promoter activity in response to
E1A using mutant constructs of the Dicer promoter–reporter
(F2) with mutated transcription-factor–binding elements. Compared with the transfection of vector alone in MDA-MB-231 cells,
E1A increased the promoter activity of the F2, F2/mutSP1, F2/
mutGATA1, and F2/mutPOU2F1 elements but not the F2/mutC/
EBPa element (Fig. 5D). The results from the luciferase reporter
assay suggested that the C/EBPa-binding element is critical
for E1A-mediated upregulation of Dicer promoter activity. The
C/EBPa transcription factor suppresses tumorigenesis and is
linked to the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation in lung and breast cancer (32, 33). We observed that C/EBPa
expression was inversely correlated with CD44, KLF4, SOX2,
Nanog, and OCT4 expression (Supplementary Table S5) and
invasiveness in breast cancer patients (Supplementary Fig. S7)
and was signiﬁcantly correlated with better survival outcomes
(Supplementary Fig. S8A and S8B). We further veriﬁed the ability
of E1A to increase the association of C/EBPa with the Dicer
promoter using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The
results showed that MDA-MB-231 cells with ectopic expression
of E1A increased the binding ability of C/EBPa at the Dicer
promoter (Fig. 5E). To deﬁne the role of C/EBPa that is involved
in Dicer regulation and E1A-mediated sensitization to paclitaxel,
we knocked down C/EBPa in MDA-MB-231/E1A cells and found
that MDA-MB-231/E1A/shC/EBPa cells reduced Dicer expression
(Fig. 5F) and the transcriptional activity of Dicer (Fig. 5G) and
decreased paclitaxel sensitivity (Fig. 5H). We also found that
knockdown of C/EBPa in MDA-MB-231/E1A cells increased
ALDH activity (Fig. 5I) and sphere formation (Fig. 5J) compared
with MDA-MB-231/E1A/shCtrl cells. Moreover, we observed that
the level of C/EBPa positively correlated with Dicer expression in
breast cancer patients (Fig. 5K; Supplementary Table S4) but
negatively correlated with the expression level of AXL (Supplementary Table S6). Taken together, these results indicated that
E1A upregulated the expression of Dicer through C/EBPa transcriptional activity, which resulted in chemosensitization to paclitaxel in breast cancer cells.

Transcriptional regulation of Dicer by E1A through C/EBPa
E1A-induced Dicer expression increased miR-494 expression
and subsequently reduced AXL; therefore, we investigated the
mechanism involved in E1A-mediated Dicer induction. By blocking the de novo synthesis of Dicer with actinomycin D and
inhibiting protein synthesis of Dicer with cycloheximide treatment, we observed that E1A did not affect the mRNA and protein
stability of Dicer in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A
and S6B). In addition, we found that the relative mRNA level of
Dicer was increased in MDA-MB-231, HS578t, and HBL100 cancer

Upregulation of Dicer through the E1A-mediated MAPK14/C/
EBPa pathway
The role of C/EBPa in growth inhibition has been reported in
lung and breast cancer, and this activity is regulated by the
MAPK14 mitogen-activated protein kinase in breast cancer (32,
33). In addition, we observed that MAPK14 expression positively
correlated with C/EBPa (Supplementary Table S7) and Dicer
(Supplementary Table S4) expression, negatively correlated with
AXL expression (Supplementary Table S6), and inversely correlated with stem cell markers (Supplementary Table S8) in breast

cancer. In addition, a high level of MAPK14 in breast cancer
patients was signiﬁcantly correlated with better survival outcomes
(Supplementary Fig. S8C and S8D). We further examined the
expression of MAPK14 and C/EBPa in MDA-MB-231 cells with
ectopic expression of E1A and found that E1A increased the
phosphorylation of MAPK14 and C/EBPa and the total C/EBPa
protein level (Fig. 6A). We also found that the tumors from MDAMB-231/E1A–bearing mice express higher phospho-C/EBPa, C/
EBPa and phospho-MAPK14 than the vector control group (Fig.
6B). Because E1A has been reported to increase sensitization to
drug-induced apoptosis through inactivation of Akt and activation of the proapoptotic factor MAPK14 (34, 35), we treated
MDA-MB-231/E1A cells with an MAPK14-speciﬁc inhibitor
(SB203580) to investigate whether MAPK14 is involved in C/
EBPa and Dicer regulation and E1A-mediated chemosensitization. As shown in Fig. 6C, inhibition of MAPK14 phosphorylation
observably decreased the expression and activation of C/EBPa
and Dicer expression (Fig. 6C, lane 3 vs. lane 2). In addition, the
abolishment of MAPK14 phosphorylation in 231/E1A cells signiﬁcantly reduced E1A-mediated sensitivity to paclitaxel, but this
effect was reversed by expression of Dicer (Fig. 6D), suggesting
that Dicer expression was regulated by the MAPK14/C/EBPa
signaling axis. Knockdown of MAPK14 in 231/E1A cells also
reduced Dicer expression (Fig. 6E, lane 3), decreased E1A-induced
paclitaxel sensitivity (Fig. 6F), and increased ALDH activity (Fig.
6G) and sphere formation (Fig. 6H). These effects were rescued by
transfection of C/EBPa in 231/E1A/shMAPK14 cells. These results
revealed that E1A/MAPK14/C/EBPa signaling positively regulated the expression of Dicer and E1A-mediated sensitization to
paclitaxel in breast cancer cells.

Discussion
Dicer is required for processing precursor miRNAs into mature
miRNAs, and dysregulation of miRNAs is involved in tumor
progression and resistance to therapies for breast cancer (36,
37). Recent studies indicate that Dicer may act as a tumor
suppressor for cancer stemness, metastasis, and tumor progression (22, 38). However, it is still unclear whether Dicer expression
and paclitaxel sensitivity in breast cancer are correlated. In this
study, we found that increasing Dicer expression induced the
mature miR-494 to block the synthesis of the AXL protein, which

sensitized breast cancer cells to paclitaxel-induced cell death and
stemness suppression. Moreover, we provide evidence of the
underlying mechanism of this process, which involved the transcriptional regulation of Dicer expression by upstream E1A-mediated MAPK14/C/EBPa signaling (Fig. 6I).
Downregulation of Dicer and Drosha are associated with a lack
of expression of the ER, PR, triple-negative, and basal-like phenotypes of breast cancer (39) and with a poor prognosis in
patients with ovarian cancer (16). A low level of Dicer is associated
with resistance to 5-FU–based chemoradiotherapy in patients
with oral squamous cell carcinoma (40) and contributes to
cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells (23). In addition, the
tumor-suppressive effects of Dicer can be abolished by hypoxia,
which then promotes cancer stemness and tumor progression in
breast cancer in vitro and in vivo (20, 38), suggesting that inducing
Dicer expression might suppress tumor progression. These observations offer a therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.
Speciﬁcally, our ﬁndings reveal that the upregulation of Dicer by
E1A increased miR-494 maturation to repress AXL expression and
increased paclitaxel sensitivity and stem cell phenotypes in breast
cancer. These results provide evidence supporting a correlation
between Dicer expression and paclitaxel chemosensitization in
breast cancer cells.
Dicer is transcriptionally targeted by cyclin D1 and coordinates
miRNA biogenesis to induce cell proliferation and migration in
breast cancer (41). However, anticancer metabolic effects of
Metformin have been reported to induce transcription factors,
E2Fs, to drive Dicer expression, leading to the upregulation of
miR-33a maturation and downregulation of c-MYC, IRS-2, and
HIF1alpha in breast cancer (42), suggesting that targeting the
upstream regulation of Dicer might provide a novel strategy for
the treatment of breast cancer patients. Here, we found that E1A
upregulated the expression level of Dicer through inducing the
binding of C/EBPa to the Dicer promoter in breast cancer cells.
The induction of C/EBPa expression in breast cancer cell lines
results in cell-cycle arrest and is associated with the ER- and PRnegative status of breast cancer patients (33). These results are
consistent with our observation and reveal that levels of C/EBPa
and Dicer negatively correlated with advanced breast cancer. In
addition, the expression of C/EBPa is signiﬁcantly regulated by
the MAPK14 kinase to suppress lung tumor development in vivo
(32). Therefore, the upregulation of Dicer that is involved in the

Dicer Represses AXL and Elicits Paclitaxel Sensitization

suppression of cancer cell growth might occur through C/EBPa
expression and its upstream MAPK14 kinase activity. Besides, the
activity of MAPK14 kinase was upregulated by E1A-induced
downregulation of Akt activity, resulting in enhancement of
E1A-mediated chemosensitization (35), and repression of Akt
activity was correlated with E1A-induced PP2A/C expression in
breast cancer (9, 34). Taken together, we suggest that the upregulation of Dicer contributed to paclitaxel sensitization of breast
cancer through a possible signal cascade induced by E1A, involving PP2A/C, Akt, MAPK14 kinase, and C/EBPa.
Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs affect treatment
resistance in breast cancer through their regulation of key resistance-associated proteins (36). miR-328 negatively regulated
breast cancer resistance protein (BRCP) and increased mitoxantrone sensitivity in breast cancer cells (43); in addition, suppression of miR-34a confers paclitaxel resistance through upregulation of SIRT1 and Bcl2 expression in prostate cancer cells (44).
These results suggest that miRNA-targeted oncogenes might be
associated with chemotherapy sensitization in cancer cells.
Because AXL associates with EGFR and acts synergistically with
other RTKs to promote signaling, it is a potential oncogenic target
for treatment resistance in breast cancer (45). Previous studies
showed that E1A negatively regulated the expression of AXL and is
involved in E1A-mediated growth suppression, but its involvement in the regulation of AXL expression is not clear (46). Our
study revealed that miR-494 direct targeting of the 30 -UTR of AXL
is dependent on E1A-upregulated Dicer, thereby downregulating
AXL protein and the sensitization to paclitaxel in breast cancer
cells. miR-494 suppresses cell viability and angiogenic ability in
medulloblastoma cells through negative regulation of syndecan-1
(47) and inhibits gastrointestinal stromal tumor cell proliferation
through downregulation of KIT (48). In contrast, miR-494
induced TRAIL resistance through inhibition of BIM expression
in non–small cell lung cancer (49). Finally, miR-494 targeting of
AXL through E1A-upregulated Dicer expression might lay the
foundation for the development of speciﬁc therapeutic strategies
for overcoming paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer.
In summary, we revealed in this study that E1A positively
regulates Dicer expression through the MAPK14/C/EBPa pathway
and found that elevated Dicer expression increased mature miR494 repression of AXL expression, leading to a reduction in stemlike cell properties and to an enhancement of the sensitivity to
paclitaxel in breast cancer cells. Our ﬁnding provides evidence of a
novel function and mechanism for Dicer in regulating cancer
stemness and paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer and offers a

potential strategy for targeting the MAPK14/C/EBPa/Dicer/miR494/AXL pathway as a treatment for breast cancer with a poor
response to paclitaxel chemotherapy.
