ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal and aggressive adult brain tumor,
requiring the development of efficacious therapeutics. Towards this goal, we screened
five genetically distinct patient-derived brain-tumor initiating cell lines (BTIC) with
a unique collection of small molecule epigenetic modulators from the Structural
Genomics Consortium (SGC). We identified multiple hits that inhibited the growth
of BTICs in vitro, and further evaluated the therapeutic potential of EZH2 and HDAC
inhibitors due to the high relevance of these targets for GBM. We found that the novel
SAM-competitive EZH2 inhibitor UNC1999 exhibited low micromolar cytotoxicity in
vitro on a diverse collection of BTIC lines, synergized with dexamethasone (DEX)
and suppressed tumor growth in vivo in combination with DEX. In addition, a unique
brain-penetrant class I HDAC inhibitor exhibited cytotoxicity in vitro on a panel of
BTIC lines and extended survival in combination with TMZ in an orthotopic BTIC model
in vivo. Finally, a combination of EZH2 and HDAC inhibitors demonstrated synergy in
vitro by augmenting apoptosis and increasing DNA damage. Our findings identify key
epigenetic modulators in GBM that regulate BTIC growth and survival and highlight
promising combination therapies.

GBM treatments including high inter- and intra-tumoral
heterogeneity [2, 3], the inability of 98% known drugs
to cross the blood-brain barrier [4] and the presence of
a population of stem cell-like glioma cells, referred to as
brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs), that are thought to
contribute to GBM propagation, treatment resistance and
tumor recurrence [5–7]. Therefore, to further improve
the survival of GBM patients, new therapeutic strategies
including combination-based therapies need to be
considered.

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal and
aggressive adult brain tumor. The standard-of-care
treatment includes surgical resection, followed by
radiotherapy and chemotherapy with the alkylating
agent temozolomide (TMZ). Despite this multifaceted
therapy, prognosis for GBM patients remains poor with
a median survival of only 14.6 months [1]. There are
numerous hurdles impeding the development of successful

Epigenetic mechanisms are being increasingly
recognized as a major factor contributing to the
pathogenesis of GBM [8, 9]. Epigenetic silencing of
O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) by
promoter hypermethylation is associated with significantly
longer survival [10]. Recent genome-wide genomic and
epigenomic analyses have revealed that 46% of 291 GBM
samples tested have at least one somatic mutation in genes
associated with chromatin modification [11]. Epigenetic
alterations, particularly those involving enzymatic
modifications of either DNA or associated histone
proteins are currently being exploited for therapeutic
drug targeting. However, at the moment there is limited
knowledge regarding the mechanisms through which
epigenetic modifiers function in GBM, and the possibility
of therapeutic targeting has not been rigorously tested for
this tumor.
In the current study, we performed a drug screen
on five genetically-distinct BTIC lines with a unique
collection of small molecule epigenetic inhibitors
compiled by the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC),
and validated our findings on these and 10 additional lines.
The BTIC lines were generated from tumors from newly
diagnosed and recurrent GBM patients [12–17], exhibit
the ability to self-renew and differentiate into multiple
neural cell lineages [14], encompass the diversity of
molecular genetic alterations that are known to occur
in human GBM patients (e.g. EGFR, PTEN, p53, IDH1
etc.) and are tumorigenic in orthotopic xenograft murine
models [14, 18]. We identified multiple hits, and further
evaluated the therapeutic potential of compounds
regulating two epigenetic modifiers, enhancer of zeste
homolog 2 (EZH2) and histone deacetylase (HDAC), both
of which have high relevance for GBM.EZH2 as well as
HDAC1 and HDAC2 are over-expressed in GBM [19–
23] and are associated with shorter overall survival [19,
20, 22]. We show here that the SAM-competitive EZH2
inhibitor UNC1999 exhibits low micromolar cytotoxicity
in vitro on a diverse collection of BTIC lines, synergizes
with Dexamethasone (DEX) and suppresses tumor growth
in vivo in combination with DEX. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that a unique brain-penetrant class I HDAC
inhibitor is cytotoxic in vitro on a panel of BTIC lines
and is able to extend survival in combination with TMZ
in an orthotopic model in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate
that the combination of EZH2 and HDAC inhibitors shows
synergy in vitro by augmenting apoptosis and increasing
DNA damage of GBM tumors.

distinct patient-derived BTIC lines with an SGC collection
of 24 chemical probes (Figure 1A). Compound addition
was performed digitally using 12-point serial dilutions,
and alamarBlue reduction was performed after 3 or 6 days
to assess metabolic activity as an indicator of cell health.
Compounds exhibiting IC50 values lower than 5 μM in
either the 3 day or a 6-day screening assays were defined
as hits (marked in red, Figure 1B). Compounds targeting
multiple epigenetic targets were identified that suppressed
BTIC health at low micromolar or nanomolar ranges,
including histone methyl transferases (G9A, EZH2,
SMYD2), BET bromodomains, histone demethylase
(JMJD3) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Compounds
that targeted BET ((+)-JQ1) and JMJD3 (GSKJ4)
have been recently described as promising compounds
for GBM and pediatric GBM [24–26], and therefore
we decided to not pursue them further. We tested the
compounds targeting G9A and SMYD2 for their putative
target inhibition (H3K9me2 and H3K4me1/H3K36me2,
respectively) and found them inactive, suggesting that
their cytotoxicity could be due to off-target effects.
Therefore, we decided to focus on novel compounds
targeting EZH2 and HDAC, both of which have high
relevance for GBM [19–22, 27].

Targeting EZH2 in BTICs using a novel SAMcompetitive inhibitor UNC1999
EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of the Polycomb
Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) that inhibits gene
expression through tri-methylation of lysine 27 on
histone H3 (H3K27me3). Deregulation of EZH2 has
been documented in various cancer types, both solid
and hematological, and is associated with poor survival
[28–30]. Therefore, we first assessed EZH2 expression in
a panel of genetically-diverse BTIC lines. We observed
EZH2 mRNA (Figure 2A) and protein (Figure 2B) in
all BTIC lines tested, with virtually no expression in
skin-derived precursor cells (SKPs), which are primary
postnatal human neural-like dermal stem cells used as a
normal neural stem cell control. While we did not observe
in BTIC lines EZH2 activating point mutations Y641
and A677 that occur in hematological malignancies, an
increase in copy number variations (CNV) was detected
in the majority of those lines (Supplementary Table 1).
We next compared the SAM-competitive EZH2
inhibitors GSK126, GSK343, UNC1999 and EPZ6438
on 10 BTIC lines for their ability to suppress cell health
in the alamarBlue assay. UNC1999, a SAM-competitive
EZH2/EZH1 inhibitor [31] identified in our screening of
the SGC library, exhibited superior ability to suppress
cell health as compared to the other inhibitors (IC50 = 2-5
μM; Figure 2C), with EPZ6438 being inactive even at 10
μM (data not shown). UNC2400, an inactive analogue of
UNC1999 [29, 31], did not affect cell growth at 10 μM or
lower, suggesting that the biological effects of UNC1999

inhibitor. To address why other EZH2 inhibitors did not
show similar efficacy to UNC1999, we compared the
target inhibition of UNC1999 with three other EZH2
inhibitors, GSK343, GSK126 and EPZ-6438 at the
same concentrations (2 μM and 3 μM) on BTICs. We
assessed different potential targets including H3K27me3,
H3K27me2, H3K9Me2, H3K4Me1 and H3K27ac as
well as EZH2 and total histone H3 (Supplementary

Figure 1). UNC1999 inhibited only trimethylation of
H3K27 without affecting the other targets or altering
the total level of EZH2 or Histone H3. The other three
inhibitors suppressed trimethylation of H3K27, GSK126
and EPZ-6438 also inhibited dimethylation of H3K27, and
GSK343 also reduced H3K9me2 and H3K4me1 levels.
Our conclusion is that UNC1999 is more specific than the
other inhibitors and therefore, we focused on UNC1999
for our further studies.

flow cytometry. BT73 cells were treated with varying
concentrations of UNC1999 (2-5 μM), and cellular DNA
content was examined 48 hours later. The percentage
of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle significantly
increased as a consequence of drug treatment, with a
slight decrease in the percentage of cells in both S and
G2/M phases (Figure 3C). In contrast, there were no
changes in the percentage of cells at different stages of
the cell cycle in cells treated with UNC2400, an inactive
analogue of UNC1999 [29, 31]. In BTICs, UNC1999
treatment completely inhibited trimethylation of lysine 27
on Histone H3 (H3K27) without affecting the total levels
of either Histone H3 or EZH2 (Figure 3D). Although
there were no changes detected in the expression of the
apoptotic marker cleaved-PARP as a consequence of drug
treatment, we observed an increase in the expression
of LC3B II, suggesting that the potential mechanism
of cell death could be autophagy rather than apoptosis
(Figure 3D), in agreement with the reported autophagic

We first asked whether treatment of BTICs with
UNC1999 affected cell viability. The BT73 line was
treated with increasing concentrations of UNC1999 (4-6
μM) and viable cells were counted at 72 and 96 hours
post-treatment. UNC1999 significantly decreased viable
cell numbers in a dose-dependent manner as compared
to DMSO-treated cells at all time points tested (Figure
3A). Next, the effect of UNC1999 on self-renewal was
investigated. For this, BT73 and BT147 cells were treated
with varying doses of the inhibitor and the number of
spheres counted after 6 days. UNC1999 completely
abrogated sphere formation at 5 μM in both BTIC
lines (Figure 3B). To ask whether UNC1999 also had
cytostatic effects on BTIC lines, the percentage of cells
in the different stages of the cell cycle was examined by

mechanism of GSK343 and UNC1999-mediated cell death
in breast and lung carcinoma cell lines [32]. In order to
rule out apoptosis and necroptosis, we used Annexin V
assay to assess the percentage of apoptotic cells. We could
not detect Annexin V-positive cells at either 24, 48 or 72
hours following UNC1999 treatment (data not shown).
Moreover, co-incubation of cells with UNC1999 and pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK did not rescue the cells
from dying (Figure 3E), suggesting that UNC1999 induces
cell death independently of apoptosis. Necroptosis was
apparently not involved in UNC1999-induced cell death.
Co-incubation of cells with Necrostatin, a necroptosis
inhibitor [33], failed to rescue UNC1999-induced cell
death (Figure 3F), and co-incubating the cells with
UNC1999 and both Necrostatin and Z-VAD-FMK also did
not have an effect on cell viability, confirming that these
mechanisms are not compensating for each other. Since
UNC1999 increased the expression of the autophagic
marker LC3B II, we suggest that autophagy rather than
necroptosis or apoptosis is the mechanism of BTIC cell
death by this compound.

Moreover, we observed no additional increase in LC3B
II. To investigate further potential autophagy mechanisms,
the effect of UNC199 or DEX alone and in combination
on p62/SQTM1, a known autophagy substrate that
decreases as a consequence of ongoing autophagy, was
examined. We found that in both BT73 and BT147 lines,
p62 levels increased in the combination group as compared
to the DMSO control and with the single drugs alone
(Supplementary Figure 3). These findings are similar to
other reports showing that impairment of autophagic flux
results in autophagy-induced cell death [35, 36].
We next evaluated the efficacy of UNC1999
treatment alone and in combination with DEX in vivo. To
assess whether UNC1999 crossed the blood brain barrier
and accumulated to sufficient concentrations in vivo, we
performed a pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma and brain
samples using LC/MS. Following oral administration of
150 mg/kg, a dose in which UNC1999 elicited no toxicity,
the concentration in the plasma was ~7 μM and only 0.5
μM in the brain at both 30 min and 4 hours. Since this
brain concentration was 10-fold less than the in vitro IC50
on the BTIC lines, we did not proceed with an orthotopic
model. We instead tested its efficacy in a flank xenograft
model where we found that the concentration of the drug
in the tumor was ~13 μM, as a proof of concept. For this
analysis, NOD/SCID mice with small established BT73
tumors were treated with either vehicle, UNC1999 alone
(150 mg/kg), DEX alone (1 mg/kg) or a combination of the
two drugs for 17 days. To evaluate target inhibition in vivo,
we isolated tumors 10 days after initiation of treatment
with 150 mg/kg of UNC1999. UNC1999 decreased the
trimethylation of H3K27 in a similar fashion to that
observed in vitro (Supplementary Figure 4), indicating that
UNC1999 exhibits potent target inhibition both in vitro
and in vivo. As shown in Figure 4C, UNC1999 alone was
ineffective at suppressing tumor growth. Treatment with
DEX alone had only a partial effect, while treatment with
both UNC1999 and DEX significantly suppressed tumor
growth as compared to control or single-agent treatment.

The combination of UNC1999 and
dexamethasone is synergistic in vitro and
suppresses tumor growth in vivo
We next asked whether UNC1999 efficacy in vitro
can be augmented through combination with additional
drugs. We first tested a combination of UNC1999 and
Temozolomide (TMZ), a known GBM chemotherapeutic
agent, on two BTIC lines (BT73 and BT147). The results
were analyzed using the CalcuSyn median effect model,
where the CI indicates synergysm (CI<0.9), additivity
(CI=0.9-1.1) and antagonism (CI>1.1). We found that at
all concentrations tested there was no synergy or additivity
detected in a combination of UNC1999 and TMZ with
CI values at the ED50= 2.09, ED75=1.38 and ED90=1.19
in BT73 and ED50=1.2, ED75=1.19 and ED90=1.19 in
BT147 (Supplementary Figure 2). We then examined a
combination of UNC1999 with Dexamethasone (DEX), a
corticosteroid commonly used to treat brain edema in GBM
patients. It has been previously shown that a combination
of a different EZH2 inhibitor, EPZ-6438, was synergistic
with glucocorticoid receptor agonists such as prednisolone
and dexamethasone in B cell lymphoma [34]. In agreement
with those findings, we found that a combination of
UNC1999 with DEX was synergistic in two different BTIC
lines in vitro with CI values at the ED50=0.87, ED75=0.82
and ED90=0.78 in BT73 and ED50=0.84, ED75=0.78
and ED90=0.73 in BT147 (Figure 4A). There were no
additional effects on H3K27me3 levels as a consequence
of combination (Figure 4B), nor were there changes in
EZH2 protein levels, total Histone H3 or cleaved-PARP.
We did observe a decrease in c-MYC protein expression
following treatment with the combination of drugs,
although DEX alone was also able to suppress c-MYC.

Two class I HDAC inhibitors were identified as hits
from the epigenetic screen, Dacinostat and CI994. Both
HDAC1 and HDAC2 mRNA and protein were detected in
most of the BTIC lines tested, and were absent in pediatric
skin-derived precursor cells (SKPs) (Supplementary Figure
5). Sequencing of BTIC lines revealed that the BT147 line
encoded a point mutation in HDAC2, and several lines had
an increase in HDAC2 copy number variations (CNV)
(Supplementary Table 1). Since blood-brain-barrier (BBB)
penetration is one of the obstacles impeding successful
implementation of HDAC inhibitors in the clinic, we tested

in vivo efficacy studies. A range of doses (3, 10, 20 and
40 mg/kg) was administered in vivo over 5 days by oral
gavage. Plasma and brains were collected and analyzed
by LC/MS. Micromolar concentrations of the drug were
detected in both the plasma and the brain (Figure 6A).
We chose 10 mg/kg for in vivo studies, since the brain
concentration achieved at this dose level at 3 hours was
10-fold over the in vitro IC50 of compound 26 efficacy of
seven BTIC lines. To determine in vivo efficacy, NOD/
SCID mice with small established BT147 intracranial
tumors were randomized into 4 groups and treated with 1)
vehicle, 2) compound 26 alone (10 mg/kg), 3) TMZ alone
(50 mg/kg) or 4) combination of the two drugs for a total
of 3 cycles (5 days ON, 2 days OFF). As shown in Figure
6B, treatment with compound 26 alone was ineffective
in extending survival. Treatment with TMZ alone had a
partial effect, while treatment with both compound 26
and TMZ was able to significantly extend survival as
compared to control (approximately 20 days) or singleagent treatment (by approximately 10 days).

an analogue of Entinostat, a known clinical HDAC inhibitor,
optimized to improve BBB penetration in a baboon model
[37]. This compound (referred to herein as “compound 26”)
has been reported to inhibit recombinant human HDAC1 and
HDAC2 at nanomolar concentrations [37]. Compound 26
suppressed metabolic activity as determined by alamarBlue
assay in a panel of 15 BTIC lines with IC50 values ranging
from 57 nM to 2735 nM (Figure 5A). BT147 was identified
as the most sensitive line, possibly due to the presence of a
point mutation in HDAC2 which was also detected in the
original patient tumor. Therefore, we focused our studies on
the brain-penetrant HDAC inhibitor compound 26.
We first asked whether treatment with compound 26
affected cell viability. BT73 cells were treated with varying
concentrations of compound 26 (100-400 nM) and cell
viability was determined at 72 and 96 hours post-treatment.
The inhibitor significantly decreased cell viability in a dose
and time-dependent manner (Figure 5B). To determine
whether compound 26 also affected self-renewal, BT73
and BT147 cells were treated with different doses of the
inhibitor, and the number of spheres was quantified after 6
days. Compound 26 completely abrogated sphere formation
at 5 μM in both BTIC lines (Figure 5C). We next examined
the percentage of cells found at the different stages of the cell
cycle. BT73 cells were treated with varying concentrations
of compound 26 (200 nM-1000 nM) and cellular DNA
content examined 72 hours later. The percentage of cells in
the G1 phase of the cell cycle significantly increased while
the percentage in both S and G2/M phases was decreased
(Figure 5D). Treatment with compound 26 induced
hyperacetylation of Histone H3 in a dose-dependent manner,
without affecting the total levels of Histone H3, HDAC1 or
HDAC2 (Figure 5E). We also observed an increase in the
levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1
and cleaved-PARP, suggesting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
as potential mechanisms of action of the inhibitor (Figure
5E). In order to further confirm the mechanism of cell
death, we used Annexin V assay to assess the percentage
of apoptotic cells (Figure 5F). BT73 cells were treated with
varying concentrations of compound 26 (400 nM-1000
nM) and the percentage of both early (Annexin V-positive,
PI-negative) and late (Annexin V-positive, PI-positive)
apoptotic cells was quantified 72 hours later. The percentage
of early and late apoptotic cells significantly increased in a
dose-dependent manner as compared to vehicle-treated cells,
confirming that compound 26 induced cell death through
apoptosis.

HDAC inhibitor compound 26 is synergistic with
UNC1999 in vitro
Lastly, we examined the efficacy of combining
UNC1999 and the HDAC inhibitor. We hypothesized
that inhibition of two distinct epigenetic pathways might
complement each other and result in strong synergism.
Indeed, a combination of UNC1999 with the HDAC
inhibitor demonstrated strong synergism in two different
BTIC lines in vitro with CI values at the ED50=0.55,
ED75=0.49 and ED90=0.48 in BT73 and ED50=0.35,
ED75 =0.30 and ED90=0.27 in BT147 (Figure 7A).
Similarly, we observed either synergistic or additive
effects when we tested a combination of compound 26
and two other EZH2 inhibitors, GSK126 and EPZ6438
(Supplementary Figure 6). For GSK126, we observed
CI values at the ED50, ED75, ED90 of 1.04, 1.04 and
1.05 in BT73 and ED50, ED75, ED90 of 0.78, 0.70 and
0.64 in BT147. For EPZ6438, we detected CI values at
the ED50, ED75, ED90 of 0.6, 0.6 and 0.61 in BT73 and
ED50, ED75, ED90 of 0.6, 0.75 and 0.94 in BT147. These
results suggest that simultaneously blocking EZH2 and
HDAC1/2 may be a potential therapeutic avenue, as we
have observed similar synergistic or additive responses
with three structurally-different EZH2 inhibitors. We
did not observe any additional effect on H3K27me3
or acetylation of Histone H3 with the combination of
compound 26 and UNC1999 (Figure 7B), nor did we
detect changes in total levels of EZH2, Histone H3,
HDAC1 or HDAC2. There was, however, an increase in
cleaved-PARP, γH2AX, LC3BII as well as a decrease in
c-MYC in cells treated with the combination of drugs,
in particular in BT147 cells. These results suggest that
several mechanisms are in place that can explain the
synergy of the two compounds in vitro.

EZH1 inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in several
cancer models such as leukemia, multiple myeloma and
colon cancer [29, 39, 40]. We show here that UNC1999
is cytotoxic in vitro in a diverse panel of GBM BTIC
lines, inhibits self-renewal, causes cell cycle arrest at
G1 stage and induces down-regulation of H3K27me3.
Our data suggests that UNC1999-induced cell death is
independent of either apoptosis or necroptosis, and may
induce defective autophagy, as judged by the accumulation
of both LC3BII and p62/SQSTM1. A similar mechanism
of action has been recently described by Button et al. for
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors [35].

Increased and decreased expression of EZH2 have
both been implicated in the development and progression
of a variety of cancers types. EZH2 overexpression is
associated with aggressiveness and worse prognosis in
prostate, breast, bladder, endometrial tumors, melanoma
and GBM [30]. Additionally, gain-of-function point
mutations at Y641 of EZH2 were identified in 22%
of DLBCL and 7-12% of follicular lymphomas [41].
These mutations result in enhanced enzymatic function
of EZH2 leading to increased levels of tri-methylated
H3K27 and repression of PRC2 targets. However, EZH2
can also act as a tumor suppressor, with loss-of-function

mutations identified in a subset of myelodisplastic
syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms and T cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Moreover, recurrent
missense mutations in the PRC2 substrate lysine residue
27 of histone H3 and its variants occur in 31% of pediatric
GBM, 78% of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG)
and 50% of pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG), but
not in adult GBM. The H3K27M mutation is oncogenic,
blocking growth-suppressive PRC2 methylation activity
resulting in reduced H3K27 methylation and derepression
of PRC2 target genes. In this regard, inhibition of H3K27
demethylation mediated by JMJD3, using the inhibitor
GSK-J4, suppressed the growth of DIPG tumors grown as
xenografts [24]. Thus, while EZH2 inhibition may prove
beneficial in adult GBM, it will most likely be detrimental
for patients with pediatric gliomas.
Until now, most of the studies in GBM have
used either EZH2 knockdown or treatment with
3-deazaneplanocin (DZNep) in order to assess the effect of
EZH2 inhibition [19, 42, 43]. However, DZNep is a potent
S-adenosylhomocysteine inhibitor which inhibits EZH2
in an indirect manner though depletion of cellular levels
of all PRC2 components, resulting in decreased H3K27
methylation. In contrast, UNC1999 directly inhibits
EZH2 and in a potent and selective manner. Interestingly,
de Vries et al. reported that prolonged EZH2 depletion in
glioma switched tumor cells to a different epigenetic state
that enhanced cell proliferation and DNA damage repair,
resulting in tumor progression [44]. However, shortterm EZH2 depletion significantly improved survival,
suggesting that determining the precise dosing schedules
will be crucial for a successful implementation of EZH2
inhibitors into the clinic.
We hypothesize that the superior efficacy of
UNC1999 in vitro as compared to other EZH2 inhibitors
may be due to its ability to simultaneously target
both EZH2 and EZH1. Konze et al. [31], which first
characterized UNC1999, found that it was 10,000fold more selective for EZH2 as compared to other
methyltransferases (Konze et al., Figure 2G). The only
other histone methyl transferase that UNC1999 inhibited
was EZH1, albeit 10-fold less potently than EZH2. In
contrast, GSK126 and EPZ-6438 were over 50-fold more
potent towards EZH1 than EZH2. This finding suggests
that UNC1999 may be more effective in inducing BTIC
cell death due to suppression of both EZH2 and EZH1.
An additional issue regarding the existing EZH2 and
HDAC class I inhibitors is their inability to penetrate the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) [45]. BBB penetration is one of
the major issues impeding successful therapeutic targeting
in GBM, as more than 98% of drugs fail to cross the BBB.
Although UNC1999 did not cross the BBB, we report
on the efficacy of a promising class I HDAC inhibitor,
optimized for optimal brain penetration. This inhibitor was
identified when a series of compounds using Entinostat
as a backbone were synthesized and tested in baboons
[37]. Compound 26 from these studies potently inhibited
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HDAC1 and HDAC2 and crossed the BBB. This inhibitor
exhibited nanomolar to low micromolar cytotoxicity in
vitro, disrupted self-renewal, caused cell cycle arrest,
induced apoptosis and hyper-acetylation of histone H3
and demonstrated efficacy in an orthotopic BTIC model in
combination with TMZ. Interestingly, we have also found
that a combination of the UNC1999 EZH2 and compound
26 HDAC class I inhibitors demonstrated synergy in vitro.
This combination has been previously tested in other
cancers such as gallbladder carcinoma [46], however
we believe this is the first report that demonstrates such
synergy in GBM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Primary cells
GBM BTIC lines BT50, BT53, BT67, BT73, BT75,
BT92, BT100, BT119 BT143 and BT147 were previously
described [14–16, 18]. BTIC lines BT69, BT140, BT161,
BT167, BT194, BT198 and BT208 were cultured from a
series of tumor specimens (see Supplementary Table 2)
obtained following informed consent from adult GBM
patients during their operative procedure as previously
described [14] with the approval of the University of
Calgary Ethics Review Board. Briefly, BTIC cultures were
initiated in defined culture serum-free medium (SFM)
and gave rise to non-adherent spheres after 7–21 days in
culture. Primary tumor spheres were expanded for several
passages and then cryopreserved in 10% DMSO in SFM
until use in experiments (14). All BTIC lines were used at
passages of approximately 10-20.

Epigenetic library
The epigenetic library consists of 24 small molecule
compounds targeting diverse epigenetic targets. The
library (http://www.thesgc.org/chemical-probes) was
kindly provided by the Structural Genomics Consortium
(SGC, Toronto, ON; http://www.thesgc.org).

Drugs
UNC1999, GSK343, EPZ6438, GSK126 and
Necrostatin were from Selleck Chemicals, Dexamethasone
and Temozolomide from Sigma, Z-VAD-FMK from
Calbiochem, and UNC2400, a negative control for
UNC1999, was kindly provided by the SGC. The brain
penetrant HDAC inhibitor Compound 26 was obtained
from a six step synthesis starting from 4-bromo-2nitroaniline based on a previously reported synthetic route
[37]; dx.doi.org/10.1021/cn500021p).

Primary screening assay
Five BTIC lines (BT143, BT53, BT69, BT100 and
BT194) were dissociated into single cells and seeded

at 1000-2500 cells/well in 50 μL medium in 384-well
microplates. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO
as 10 mM stocks. Compound addition was performed
at OICR using HP Tecan D300 digital dispenser. For
each compound, 12-point, 2-fold serial dilutions were
performed. Drug effects were compared to cells optimally
proliferating in 0.1% DMSO alone, while wells filled
with media served as background. AlamarBlue® (5 μL)
was added after 3 or 6 days, and fluorescence intensity
measured after 6 hr on a PHERAstar microplate reader,
equipped with a λ540 excitation/ λ590 emission filter.

rabbit anti-SQSTM1/p62 (1:1000, CST#8025), rabbit antiphospho-Histone H2A. X (1:1000, Millipore 05-636), and
rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:1000, CST#5174). HRP-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) and goat anti-rabbit IgG
(1:10,000) were used as the secondary antibodies.

Immunofluorescence
Cells underwent Cytospin, fixed either with 4%
PFA (anti-SQSTM1/p62) or 100% methanol (anti-LC3B),
permeabilized with PBS/0.2% Triton X-100, washed with
PBS/ 100 mM Glycine and then incubated in IF buffer
(PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween-20),
with 2% BSA for 30 minutes as a blocking solution.
Slides with cells were incubated with primary antibodies
in blocking solution at 4°C overnight. After washing
with IF buffer, the cells were incubated with secondary
antibodies in blocking solution for 1 hr at RT. Finally, after
PBS washes, slides were mounted in Permount solution
(Thermo, Walthman, MA). Digital image acquisition was
performed with Axiovision software (Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany) on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with a
Hamamatsu (Bridgewater, NJ) Orca-R2 CCD video
camera.

Whole genome and transcriptome sequencing
DNA and RNA from each BTIC line and DNA from
peripheral blood from the respective patients were used
to construct genome and transcriptome libraries. Whole
genome and transcriptome paired-end sequencing using
the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform generated an average
genome coverage of 40X and average transcriptome
read counts of 200 million. Genomic sequence data
from normal and tumor were then aligned to the human
reference genome build GRCh37 using BWA (v0.5.7).
Data from multiple lanes were merged and duplicates
identified using Picard (v1.38). CNASeq (v0.0.6) and
APOLLOH (v0.1.1) were used to identify copy number
aberrations and loss of heterozygosity respectively. For
identification of single nucleotide variants, Samtools
(v1.0.2) was applied followed by filtering with
MutationSeq (v1.0.2), and the results were combined
with variant called with Strelka (v0.4.6.2). Small indels
were also identified using Strelka. These variants were
annotated using Ensembl (v69). Transcriptome reads were
gap-aligned using the Jaguar pipeline (v2.0.3). Further inhouse tools were used to generate read counts for exons
and genes and calculate expression levels using reads per
kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM).

Drug combination studies
The combination index (CI) was used to evaluate the
interaction between different drugs [47]. BT73 and BT147
were dissociated into single cells, seeded at 1000-3000
cells/well in 100 μL medium in 96-well plates and treated
with increasing concentrations of UNC1999, HDAC
inhibitor, DEX and TMZ. Six days after the incubation,
alamarBlue® (10 μL) was added to the plates and
fluorescence intensity measured after 6 hr on a PHERAstar
microplate reader, equipped with a λ540 excitation/λ590
emission filter. The CalcuSyn median effect model was
used to calculate the CI values and evaluate whether
the drug combinations were synergistic, antagonistic,
or additive. CI values of < 1 indicate synergism, CI = 1
indicate additivity, and CI > 1 indicate antagonism [47].

Western blot analysis
For cell lysis, cells were collected, washed in
cold PBS, and lysates prepared in RIPA lysis buffer.
Equal amounts of protein were resolved on gradient
polyacrylamide gels and subjected to immunoblotting
with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-EZH2 (1:1000,
CST#5246), rabbit anti-H3K27me3 (1:1000, CST#9733),
rabbit anti-H3K27me2 (1:1000, CST#9755), rabbit antiH3K4me1 (1:1000, CST#5326), rabbit anti-H3K9me2
(1:1000, CST#4658), mouse anti-H3K27ac (1:2500,
Milllipore 17-683), rabbit anti-histoneH3 (1:1000,
Millipore 05-928), rabbit anti-cleaved PARP (1:1000,
CST#9541L), rabbit anti-LC3B (1:1000, CST#3868P),
rabbit anti-cMYC (1:1000, CST#13987), rabbit anti-acetyl
histone H3 (1:1000, Millipore 06-599), rabbit anti-p21
(1:1000, CST#2947S), mouse anti-HDAC1 (1:1000,
CST#5356), mouse anti-HDAC2 (1:1000, CST#5113),

Pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and blood
brain barrier (BBB) penetration of compounds
To obtain plasma exposure and BBB penetration
of compounds at various time points, blood and brains
were collected form mouse after dosing compounds at
different time points. Plasma was separated from blood by
centrifugation. For analysis 20 μL plasma was transferred
into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, to which 40 μL
acetonitrile was added to denature and precipitate proteins,
and were centrifuged for 6.5 min. at 14000 rpm. The
supernatant was transferred to LCMS vials for analysis.
For quantification of drug levels in brain samples,
brains were transferred to plastic vials containing 1:2
59372

Oncotarget

(brain:water, e.g. 300 mg brain with 600 μL water) volume
of water and 2 glass Pyrex beads (4mm in size). Samples
were homogenized by bead beating (3 X 15 second
pulses of 5,000 rpm) using a Precellys 24 homogenizer
(Bertin Technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France).
Each sample was mixed vigorously with 2 volumes of
acetonitrile to precipitate out protein and were centrifuged
for 6.5 min. at 14000 rpm. The supernatant was then
transferred to LCMS vials for analysis. The concentration
in brain was corrected for dilution.

of UNC1999 (3-6 μM) or HDAC inhibitor (0.4 – 1
μM). Cells were harvested 24-72 hr later, stained for
Annexin V/propidium iodide and analyzed on a LSR II
flow cytometer. Relative numbers of early apoptotic cells
(Annexin V-positive, Propidium iodide-negative) and late
apoptotic cells (Annexin V-positive, Propidium iodidepositive) were obtained for each time point.

Sphere-formation assay
BTICs (BT73 and BT147) were seeded in triplicate
in non-TC-treated 96-well microplates at a density of
1000-2500 cells/well in 50 μL/well. Compounds were
diluted in medium (1:1000) and immediately added to the
cells in a volume of 50 μL (final concentration of DMSO
= 0.05%). Cells were re-treated 72 hrs post-plating with
drugs, and fixed after 6 days with 4% paraformaldehyde
(Electron Microscopy Sciences). Sphere number was
determined by manual counting, and the results expressed
as the mean sphere number of treated wells as compared
to DMSO-treated wells*100.

LCMS analysis
For each analysis, a calibration curve with ten
different concentrations starting from 10 mg/mL up to
10,000 ng/mL was prepared by spiking blank plasma.
Chromatographic separations were carried out on an
Acquity UPLC BEH C18 (2.1 X 50 mm, 1.7 μm) column
using ACQUITY UPLC II system. The mobile phase was
0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic
acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). A gradient starting at
95% solvent A going to 5% in 4.5 min., holding for 0.5
min., going back to 95% in 0.5 min. and equilibrating the
column for 1 min. was employed. A Waters Synapt G2S
QTof mass spectrometer equipped with an atmospheric
pressure ionization source was used for mass spectrometric
analysis. MassLynx 4.1 was used for data analysis.

Flank xenograft model
1.5x106 BTICs (73M) were resuspended in media
and injected in 100 μl volume subcutaneously into 6-8week old NOD/SCID mice. Drug treatment began when
tumor size reached ~25 mm3. Animals were randomized
into 4 groups: 1) Vehicle; 2) UNC1999 alone; 3) DEX
alone; 4) UNC1999 + DEX. Mice were injected via oral
gavage with either vehicle (10% DMSO, 40% PEG)
or UNC1999 (150 mg/kg) every day for 17 days. An
additional group of mice received intraperitoneal injection
of DEX (1 mg/kg) every day for 17 days. The combination
group received both UNC1999 and DEX administered by
oral gavage and i.p. injection respectively.

Determination of cellular DNA content
The BTIC line BT73 (0.2x106) was plated in 6-well
dishes and DMSO, UNC1999 (2 μM, 3 μM and 5 μM) or
HDAC inhibitor (0.2 μM, 0.4 μM, 0.6 μM and 1 μM) added.
After 48 hrs (UNC1999) or 72 hrs (HDAC inhibitor), cells
were harvested, washed with PBS and fixed in 70% ice-cold
ethanol. Fixed cells were treated with RNAseA, stained with
Propidium Iodide at 37°C for 1 hr and analyzed on a LSR II
flow cytometer to determine cellular DNA content.

Orthotopic xenograft model

1x105 dissociated BTICs (BT73) were seeded in
triplicate in 12-well non-tissue culture-treated plates
in 2 mL of medium. UNC1999 (4 μM - 6 μM), HDAC
inhibitor (0.1 μM - 0.4 μM) or 0.1% DMSO were added to
the cells 24 hrs later. At specific time points, spheres were
collected, dissociated and subjected to a viable cell count
by trypan blue exclusion.

BT147 spheres were dissociated into single
cell suspensions and 1x105 cells were stereotactically
implanted into the right striata of 6-8 week old NOD/SCID
mice as previously described [14]. Seven days after BTIC
implantation, mice were randomized into 4 groups and
injected via oral gavage for a total of 3 cycles (5 days ON,
2 days OFF): 1) vehicle (50% PEG, 50% water); 2) HDAC
inhibitor alone (10 mg/kg); 3) Temozolomide (TMZ) alone
(30 mg/kg) and 4) combination of HDAC inhibitor and
Temozolomide.

Annexin V assay

Statistical analysis

The ability of drugs to induce apoptosis in BTICs
was determined with an Annexin V-FITC detection kit,
used according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BD
Pharmingen). Briefly, 0.3x106 BTICs (BT73) were plated
in 6-well dishes and treated with various concentrations

Statistical analyses were performed with Microsoft
Excel using an unpaired, two-tailed student’s T-test with
P<0.05 as the significance cutoff. One-way ANOVA was
used to determine statistically significant differences from
the mean in the combination study in vivo.
