Abstract
Imatinib mesylate is widely used for the treatment of patients
with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). This compound
is very efficient in killing Bcr-Abl–positive cells in a caspasedependent manner. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence
indicated that caspase-mediated cell death (i.e., apoptosis) is
not the only type of death induced by imatinib. The goal of our
study was to evaluate the importance of the newly described
caspase-independent cell death (CID) in Bcr-Abl–positive
cells. We established in several CML cell lines that imatinib,
in conjunction with apoptosis, also induced CID. CID was
shown to be as efficient as apoptosis in preventing CML cell
proliferation and survival. We next investigated the potential
implication of a recently identified mechanism used by cancer
cells to escape CID through overexpression of the glycolytic
enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
We showed here, in several CML cell lines, that GAPDH
overexpression was sufficient to induce protection from CID.
Furthermore, imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl–positive cell lines
were found to spontaneously overexpress GAPDH. Finally, we
showed that a GAPDH partial knockdown, using specific short
hairpin RNAs, was sufficient to resensitize those resistant cells
to imatinib-induced cell death. Taken together, our results
indicate that CID is an important effector of imatinibmediated cell death. We also established that GAPDH
overexpression can be found in imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl–
positive cells and that its down-regulation can resensitize
those resistant cells to imatinib-induced death. Therefore,
drugs able to modulate GAPDH administered together with
imatinib could find some therapeutic benefits in CML
patients. [Cancer Res 2009;69(7):3013–20]

Introduction
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a clonal proliferative
malignancy originating from a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell.
CML accounts for f20% of newly diagnosed cases of leukemia in
adults. About 20% to 30% of patients with CML will die within
2 years of the diagnosis, and about 25% die each year after. All
CMLs are triggered by the fusion gene product of the Philadelphia

chromosome translocation t(9;22). Such a translocation leads to
the generation of a p210 Bcr-Abl protein harboring constitutively
active tyrosine kinase. Bcr-Abl protein is essential for the induction
of in vitro cellular transformation (1) and in vivo leukemogenesis
(2, 3). Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI-571) functions through
competitive inhibition of the ATP-binding site of the Bcr-Abl
enzyme, leading to the inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of
proteins involved in Bcr-Abl signaling (4). Molecular targeting of
signal transduction molecules by imatinib has greatly improved
the treatment of chronic phase and blast crisis in CML. Although
imatinib is unquestionably effective in CML treatment, some
patients ultimately relapse with resistant disease (5, 6). It is
estimated that 20% to 25% of treated patients will develop some
resistance (primary or secondary). Resistance may be through
several mechanisms: about half of them are due to reactivation of
Bcr-Abl kinase activity within the leukemic cells by either point
mutation or gene amplification and the second half are resistant
for reasons not directly related to Bcr-Abl (several mechanisms
have been suggested but the nature of intrinsic resistance still
needs clarification; refs. 7, 8).
It has been extensively reported that imatinib, by counteracting
Bcr-Abl activity, will induce cell death in a caspase-dependent
manner. However, it has recently been suggested that other death
mechanisms could be engaged in response to imatinib treatment
(9–12). Cell death has been classified in several categories. To date,
at least three are known: apoptosis, necrosis, and the so-called
caspase-independent cell death (CID). Apoptosis is by far the bestcharacterized type of cell death. It is defined by morphologic
modifications (chromatin condensation, loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential, plasma membrane asymmetry, overall cell
shrinkage, blebbing of the plasma membrane, and detachment
from the cellular matrix), all occurring before loss of plasma
membrane integrity. Generally, those modifications are considered
as hallmarks for executioner caspase activation (13). Apoptosis is
characterized by the very rapid removal of the dying cell in vivo
(14). In contrast, necrosis has long been considered as a passive
mode of death without established regulatory mechanism.
Classically, necrosis is defined by an early rupture of the plasma
membrane and dilation of organelles (mainly mitochondria).
Nevertheless, recent findings suggest that its occurrence and
course might also be tightly regulated (15, 16).
A large number of studies have proposed the existence of a type
of cell death that diverges from apoptosis or necrosis (17–19). In
conditions where caspase activation is completely prevented, the
process of cell death is delayed but rarely inhibited, leading to the
occurrence of CID. This CID occurs physiologically when a signal
that normally engages apoptosis fails to activate caspases. Different
CID characteristics have been reviewed in refs. 20, 21. A CIDspecific signature has yet to be found, but several morphologic

modifications are observed: ragged plasma membrane, nucleus
shrinkage and absence of apoptotic body, DNA fragmentation, and
cellular blebbing.
We have recently identified the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a specific inhibitor
of CID but not of apoptosis (22). GAPDH overexpression was
shown to rescue cells from CID stresses, allowing them to
proliferate. Importantly, we established that cell survival and
proliferation could only be observed in conditions where both
apoptosis and CID (through GAPDH expression) were blocked.
Until now, very little is known about the implication of this new
type of cell death in CML. The need for additional cancer therapy
due to treatment resistance prompted us to investigate the
potential role of CID in the context of CML.
In this study, we established that apoptosis inhibition was not
sufficient to prevent imatinib-induced cell death in Bcr-Abl–
positive cell lines. We showed that CID was as efficient as apoptosis
in killing CML cells and that GAPDH was able to protect cells from
CID in this context. Interestingly, we also found that some
imatinib-resistant CML cell lines spontaneously overexpressed
GAPDH. Finally, we could establish that GAPDH knockdown was
sufficient to resensitize those resistant cells to imatinib-induced
death. Therefore, this study represents the first demonstration that
CID modulation can sensitize resistant cancer cells to death and
also that drugs able to modulate GAPDH, when used together with
imatinib, should find some therapeutic benefit in CML patients.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Imatinib was kindly provided by Novartis Pharma. Reagents
were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Caspase inhibition
was achieved by including 20 Amol/L of qVD-oph (MPbio). The caspase

inhibitors were added 30 min before the apoptotic stimuli and replaced
at 48-h intervals. Ac-DEVD-AMC, Ac-DEVD-CHO, and zVAD-fmk were
from Alexis Biochemical. Mouse anti-V5 was from Invitrogen. Goat anti–
heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) was purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-GAPDH was from Abcam. Antimouse-horseradish peroxidase (HRP), antigoat-HRP, and antirabbit-HRP were purchased from Dakopatts.
Cell cultures. Two human CML cell lines (Bcr-Abl–positive cells), K562
and JURL-MK1, were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.)
containing 5% FCS (Perbio), 50 units/mL penicillin, 50 Ag/mL streptomycin,
and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate. Imatinib-resistant cells were isolated from
K562 cell lines (previously described in ref. 23). Mock or GAPDH-expressing
K562 and JURL-MK1 cells were isolated after nucleofection (Amaxa) with
either an empty pcDNA3.1 vector or a pcDNA3.1 encoding GAPDH-V5.
Cell death measurement. After the indicated treatment, cells were
harvested and percentage of viability was measured by propidium iodide
(PI) staining (0.5 Ag/mL) and flow cytometry analysis in FL-3.
DEVDase activity measurement. After the indicated treatment, cells
were lysed in buffer A (see ‘‘Western blot’’). Lysates were standardized
for protein content and loaded on a black 96-well plate (Cellstar) in the
presence of 0.2 mmol/L caspase-3 substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC diluted in the
following buffer: 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L
EDTA, and 10 mmol/L DTT. Caspase activity was determined on a
fluoroscan at 460 nm with or without 1 Amol/L Ac-DEVD-CHO, and specific
activities were expressed as the change in absorbance per minute per
milligram of protein.
Clonogenicity assay. Cells (3,000) were loaded in each well of the first
column of a 96-well plate and then diluted by a factor of 2 by serial dilution.
Cells were treated in the presence or absence of imatinib as indicated.
When needed, 20 Amol/L of fresh qVD-oph were added to the cell culture
every 48 h. Ten days later, the number of clones present in the last six wells
of each lane was quantified.
The results represent the number of clones in the last six wells of one
lane. Each treatment is done in duplicate in one experiment and results
represent an average of three to four independent experiments.

Role of Caspase-Independent Cell Death in CML
Measurement of GAPDH activity. Cells were lysed in buffer A (see
Western blot). Lysates were standardized for protein content and incubated
with 0.25 mmol/L NAD, 3.3 mmol/L DTT, 13 mmol/L Na4P2O7 (pH 8.5),
26 mmol/L sodium arsenate, and 25 mmol/L D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
on black 96-well plate (Cellstar). GAPDH activity is measured on a fluoroscan
at 445 nm as the increase in fluorescence relating to NADH accumulation.
Activity is expressed as the change in absorbance per milligram of protein.
Western blot. Briefly, after treatment, cells were collected, washed in
PBS, and lysed for 10 min at 4jC in buffer A [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 1% NP40, 10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 Amol/L leupeptin]. Lysates were
cleared at 10,000  g for 10 min, and proteins (50 Ag) were separated on
polyacrylamide gels (10%) and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes. After blocking nonspecific binding sites, the membrane was
incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the appropriate primary
antibody. The membranes were washed thrice with 50 mmol/L Tris,
150 mmol/L NaCl (pH 7.5), and 1% NP40 and further incubated with HRPconjugated antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblots were
revealed by autoradiography by using enhanced chemiluminescence
detection kit (Pierce).
ATP measurement. On a 96-well plate, each condition was present in
triplicate. Cells (5,000 per well) were incubated in 100 AL of medium. One
hundred microliters of substrate solution (ATPLite 1 Step kit, Perkin-Elmer)
were added and ATP content was analyzed using a luminometer following
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Vector construction. Three different short hairpin RNAs (shRNA),
targeting GAPDH, were generated: sh546 (5¶-GATCCCCGGTCATCCATGACAACTTTTTCAAGAGAAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACCTTTTTGGAAA-3¶),
sh675 (5¶-GATCCCCCATCATCCCTGCCTCTACTTTCAAGAGAAGTAGAGGCAGGGATGATGTTTTTGGAAA-3¶), and sh813 (5¶-GATCCCCCCTGCCAAATATGATGACATTCAAGAGATGTCATCATATTTGGCAGGTTTTTGGAAA3¶). Complementary sense and antisense oligonucleotides (Eurogentec) were
annealed and cloned into BglII/HindIII–cut pTER, generating sh546, sh675,
and sh813 constructs. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing
analysis.
K562 cells and imatinib-resistant K562 cells (ImaR) stably expressing one
of the shRNAs mentioned above or an empty pTER as control were obtained
after Amaxa nucleofection and zeocin selection (200 Ag/mL).
Apoptosome formation assay. The intrinsic potentials of K562 and
ImaR to form apoptosome were examined in a cell-free system as previously
described (24). Briefly, 50  106 cells were collected and washed with
50 mL of ice-cold PBS, washed in 10 mL of hypotonic extraction buffer
[50 mmol/L PIPES (pH 7.4), 50 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L EGTA, 2 mmol/L
MgCl2, 1 mmol/L PMSF, 1 mmol/L DTT], and then lysed in 100 AL of
hypotonic extraction buffer in a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was
cleared at 16,000  g. One hundred micrograms of protein were incubated
with 1 mmol/L dATP and 10 Amol/L cytochrome c for 30 min at 37jC.
Then, DEVDase activity was measured as previously described.
Statistics. Statistics were done using the percentage comparison test or
the Student’s t test. All values shown in the text and figures are means F SD.

Results
Imatinib induces both apoptosis and CID of Bcr-Abl–
positive cells. To confirm the importance of caspase dependency
in imatinib-induced death of Bcr-Abl–positive cells, K562 and
JURL-MK1 cells were incubated in the presence of imatinib for
several days. Cell death was measured as PI+ cells by flow
cytometry (Fig. 1A). In the same experiment, cells were pretreated
or not with a large-spectrum caspase inhibitor (qVD-oph) and then
treated as indicated. To minimize any cell type specificity,
experiments were systematically done in the two different BcrAbl–positive cell lines. As expected, imatinib alone induced a
massive (80–90% PI+ cells) and time-dependent death of both cell
populations. We observed that JURL-MK1 cells were more
susceptible than K562 cells to this stimulus. Interestingly, in the

presence of imatinib and qVD-oph, a massive cell death was also
observed. The death kinetic was slower, but after 5 days of imatinib
treatment, the percentage of dead cells was found to be
independent of the presence of a caspase inhibitor. The same
results were observed in the presence of another caspase inhibitor,
zVAD-fmk (data not shown). To verify that the cell death observed
in the presence of imatinib and qVD-oph was indeed caspase
independent and not due to some residual caspase activation, we
measured caspase-3 activity in both cell lines (Fig. 1B). In the
absence of qVD-oph, caspase activity was readily observed in those
conditions but was undetectable in the presence of qVD-oph at any
time point. Next, we determined whether CID was as efficient as
apoptosis in preventing colony formation. To this end, cells were
treated in the presence of different doses of imatinib F qVD-oph.
The ability of those cells to form colonies was analyzed 10 days after
stimulation. As illustrated in Fig. 2, no clone could be obtained when
cells were treated with imatinib alone. Interestingly, the addition of
qVD-oph had no significant effect on imatinib efficacy. Therefore,
we could conclude that imatinib-induced CID in CML cells
represents a central mechanism controlling cell viability.
GAPDH can protect Bcr-Abl–positive cells from imatinibinduced CID but not from apoptosis. We recently described the
ability of the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH to rescue cells from CID
(22). Because imatinib was able to induce both apoptosis and
CID, we wondered whether GAPDH could prevent imatinibinduced CID in Bcr-Abl–positive cells. For that purpose, we
established two Bcr-Abl–positive cell lines stably overexpressing a

V5-tagged form of GAPDH. Figure 3A (left) showed the expression
of the V5-tagged GAPDH in K562 and JURL-MK1 cells. The right
image illustrated the overexpression of the total amount of
GAPDH present in those two cell lines compared with the mocktransfected K562 and JURL-MK1 cells. Using a colony formation
assay (Fig. 3B), we evaluated the ability of those cells to be
protected from CID. As expected, neither parental nor GAPDHoverexpressing cells can be protected from imatinib-induced
apoptosis. Strikingly, GAPDH-overexpressing cells can form
colonies at higher rates in the presence of qVD-oph, indicating
that GAPDH can significantly protect against imatinib-induced
CID in CML cell lines.
Imatinib-resistant cells are protected from CID via endogenous GAPDH overexpression. To further analyze the importance
of CID in CML, we took advantage of ImaR cells isolated in our
laboratory (23). Unfortunately, despite several attempts, no JURLMK1–resistant cells could be isolated. ImaR cells present a
resistance to high doses of imatinib (up to 10 Amol/L imatinib)
as shown in Fig. 4A. We also verified that these cells can form
colonies in the presence of 5 Amol/L imatinib and that the addition
of qVD-oph did not significantly affect the number of clones that
are able to grow (Fig. 4B). To understand why those cells are
resistant to imatinib, we looked for described Bcr-Abl mutations or
overexpression (7). We could not find any of those in our ImaR cells
(data not shown; ref. 25). We reasoned that because those cells
failed to die in the presence of imatinib, they should have acquired
protection from both apoptosis and CID. Therefore, we first
analyzed apoptosis. For that matter, we measured apoptosomemediated caspase-3 activation in K562 and ImaR cells. As

presented in Fig. 4C, we observed that ImaR cells present a 60%
reduction of caspase activity as compared with sensitive K562 cells,
suggesting that those cells are resistant to the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway. CID resistance in ImaR cells was monitored by
investigating GAPDH levels. ImaR cells exhibited a significant
GAPDH overexpression as visualized by Western blot (Fig. 4D, top)
and quantified by measuring the GAPDH-specific activity (Fig. 4D,
bottom). We found that resistant cells displayed f30% more active
GAPDH than control cells.
Down-regulation of GAPDH expression levels resensitized
ImaR cells to imatinib. Because ImaR cells overexpressed GAPDH,
we hypothesized that reducing GAPDH level could be sufficient for
resensitizing those cells to imatinib-induced cell death. For that
purpose, we generated three different shRNAs specifically designed
to stably knock down GAPDH. Figure 5A shows the level of GAPDH
reduction obtained in ImaR cells expressing each of the three
shRNAs. sh813 and sh546 gave a mild reduction (40%), whereas
sh675 led to a larger GAPDH decrease (60%). Modulation of GAPDH
levels was carefully quantified by measuring specific activity of this
enzyme (Fig. 5B). This quantification correlated very closely with
the level of protein observed in Fig. 5A. Because GAPDH is a key
enzyme of the glycolytic pathway, we verified that its reduction had
no significant effect on the overall energetic status of those cells. As
presented in Fig. 5C, no major differences in ATP level could be
measured comparing K562, ImaR-pTER, and ImaR cells expressing
one of the GAPDH shRNAs.
To further characterize GAPDH knockdown effect on cell
viability and response to imatinib treatment, we generated
sensitive K562 cells expressing different GAPDH shRNAs as

Role of Caspase-Independent Cell Death in CML

controls. The observed GAPDH extinction was equivalent to
the one obtained for ImaR cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Figure 6A indicated that sensitive K562 cells expressing shRNA
546 (K562-sh546) or shRNA 675 (K562-sh675) were not distinguishable from K562-pTER cells in the presence and absence of
treatment, altogether indicating that a partial knockdown of
GAPDH in sensitive K562 has no significant effect on their viability
and their response to treatment.
As previously noted, reducing GAPDH levels had no significant
effect on ImaR cells in the absence of treatment (Fig. 6B). Because
sh813 and sh546 gave a similar GAPDH reduction in ImaR cells, we
chose to further characterize only two of the three knockdown cell
lines generated (see Fig. 5A and B). Strikingly, the viability of ImaR
cells expressing GAPDH shRNA 546 (ImaR-sh546) or shRNA 675
(ImaR-sh675) was profoundly affected by imatinib treatment as
compared with ImaR-pTER cells. A net increase in cell death
could be measured by flow cytometry as PI+ cells in both cell lines
(Fig. 6B, left). Then, we verified the effect of GAPDH knockdown on
the ability of those cells to form colonies (Fig. 6B, right). As
expected, no difference was observed among cells in the absence of
treatment. Importantly, as opposed to ImaR-pTER cells that could
easily grow as colonies, neither K562 nor ImaR cells expressing
sh546 or sh675 could form a significant number of colonies in the
presence of imatinib independently of the presence of qVD-oph
(Fig. 6A and B, right).

Altogether, we could establish that reduction of GAPDH level
was sufficient to resensitize ImaR cells to imatinib-induced death.

Discussion
In the present study, we established the importance of CID in the
context of CML. We showed that apoptosis inhibition (using broad
caspase inhibitors) failed to prevent imatinib-induced cell death of
Bcr-Abl–positive cells (Fig. 1). In fact, on apoptosis inhibition, CID
was acting as a death backup mechanism to kill the leukemic cells.
Therefore, we showed that apoptosis and CID occurred in parallel
in response to imatinib, albeit with different kinetics (apoptosis
occurring faster than CID). We used PI staining as a robust way to
measure cell death. One could argue that a PI cell observed was in
fact a dying cell that did not lose its integrity at the time of the
analysis. Therefore, we addressed this question using a very strict
test: the capacity of those cells to grow as clones. As presented in
Fig. 2, we established for the first time that the ability of imatinib to
prevent colony formation was mediated by both apoptosis and
CID. Indeed, we could show that even if CID is slower than
apoptosis, it is as efficient in preventing any colony formation.
It seems that CID can be observed only in conditions where
caspase-mediated apoptosis is inhibited. Apoptosis inhibition has
been shown to occur in cancer cells by various mechanisms. These
include several tumor lines that lose Apaf-1 expression (26, 27) and

can have mutation in executioner caspases. Similarly, many tumors
overexpressed inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins such as XIAP
(28). In this line, expression of one member of this IAP family
(survivin) has been linked to CML progression and resistance to
apoptosis (29), although it remains unclear whether survivin is very
effective as a caspase inhibitor. It has also been reported that BcrAbl is able to prevent apoptosis downstream of mitochondrial
cytochrome c release by perturbing caspase-9 recruitment to
Apaf-1 (30) mainly through modulation of Hsp90h (31). Finally,
apoptosome-induced caspase-3 activation was found to be
deficient in several patient samples presenting a resistance to
imatinib treatment (12).
CID occurrence in CML cells has previously been suggested
(9–12), but the exact role of this type of cell death and the
importance of its modulation were unknown. To elucidate the
implication of imatinib-induced CID in Bcr-Abl–positive cells, we
took advantage of the ability of GAPDH to specifically inhibit CID
without affecting apoptosis (22). For that matter, we generated
GAPDH-overexpressing K562 and JURL-MK1 cells and showed that
those cells became protected from CID (imatinib + qVD-oph) but
not from apoptosis (imatinib alone; Fig. 3). This is of particular
interest because glycolytic enzymes and particularly GAPDH were
shown to be overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers (32). It is
known since Warburg’s work in 1929 that cancer cells very
frequently up-regulated glucose metabolism leading to a high
uptake and use of glucose but moderate rates of mitochondrial
respiration under aerobic conditions. Frequently, up-regulation of
glycolytic metabolism has been shown to correlate with increased
tumor aggressiveness and poor patient prognosis in several cancers
(33, 34). The exact reason of glycolytic enzyme overexpression
remains unclear but we could postulate that, among other reasons,
GAPDH was overexpressed to protect cells from CID.
Imatinib discovery represents an important advance in the
management of CML and has led the way for targeted therapy of
cancer as a general ‘‘proof of concept.’’ Despite the achievable
remission rates, resistance to imatinib is an important issue for the
therapy because a minority of CML patient in chronic phase and

a substantial proportion in advanced disease phases either display
refractoriness to imatinib treatment or lose imatinib sensitivity
over time and experience relapse (7). To investigate CID
importance in the context of resistance to imatinib, we took
advantage of ImaR cells (23, 25). We showed that those cells were
resistant not only to imatinib-induced apoptosis as expected but
also to imatinib-induced CID. We could establish that those cells
are presenting a resistance to imatinib-induced apoptosis through
an inhibition of the apoptosome-induced caspase-3 activation
(Fig. 4C). The exact reason of this resistance would need further
studies but did not seem to be related to the decrease of
apoptosome component factors (data not shown).
Because imatinib is inducing apoptosis and CID, we therefore
investigated how those cells can escape CID. For that reason, we
monitored GAPDH levels in those ImaR cells and established that
they are expressing 25% to 30% more GAPDH enzyme than control
cells (Fig. 4D).
To further investigate the role of GAPDH in controlling imatinibinduced CID in ImaR cells, we specifically knocked down GAPDH
in those cells using several shRNAs (Fig. 5A and B). We carefully
verified that GAPDH reduction failed to affect the energy status
(i.e., ATP content) of the cell (Fig. 5C). Because GAPDH is not a
limiting enzyme of the glycolytic pathway, its partial reduction in
cells did not result in a major ATP depletion (Fig. 5C) and did not
modify the ability of those cells to form colony in the absence of
treatment (Fig. 6). We also verified that knocking down GAPDH to
the same extent in sensitive K562 cells did not alter their ability to
grow and to react to imatinib-induced death. Finally, we showed
that lowering GAPDH below a certain level was enough to
resensitize ImaR cells to imatinib-induced death (Fig. 6B).
Interestingly, recent clinical reports have indicated that changes
in glucose metabolism might be related to and/or predictive for the
development of imatinib resistance (35). Additionally, clinical
studies of patients with imatinib-resistant c-KIT–positive tumors
have shown avid glucose uptake on positron emission tomography
scans (36). Finally, others also observed GAPDH overexpression at
the protein level in imatinib-resistant cells (37).

Role of Caspase-Independent Cell Death in CML

Figure 6. GAPDH knockdown can counteract imatinib
resistance. A, sensitive K562 cells expressing an
empty vector (pTER ) or expressing 546 or 675 GAPDH
shRNA were treated or not with 1 Amol/L imatinib F
20 Amol/L qVD-oph. At the indicated time period, PI+
dead cells were determined by flow cytometry (left ) and
the number of clones at day 10 (right ) was analyzed as
in Fig. 2. B, sensitive K562 cells or ImaR-pTER or
ImaR cells expressing 546 or 675 GAPDH shRNA were
treated with 3 Amol/L imatinib in the presence of
20 Amol/L qVD-oph, as indicated. The percentage of
PI+ dead cells (left ) and the number of clones (right )
were measured as in Fig. 2. Points and columns, mean
of three individual experiments; bars, SD.

In conclusion, our work describes the first evidence asserting the
importance of CID in Bcr-Abl–positive cells. It seems clear that
combination, rather than sequential therapy, is an attractive option
to prevent the expansion of mutant subclones that confer
resistance to therapy, which may allow more effective elimination
of residual leukemic cells. There is a growing consensus that
inhibition of individual targets is unlikely to succeed as a
therapeutic strategy. Indeed, even in CML, it has been argued that
the efficacy of imatinib treatment requires inhibition of targets
other than Bcr-Abl (38). Therefore, regulating CID (via GAPDH
knockdown or inhibition) in addition to classic treatment could
constitute a new approach for sensitizing imatinib-resistant cells
to death.
