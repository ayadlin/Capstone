Abstract
Recurrence and subsequent metastatic transformation of
cancer develops from a subset of malignant cells, which show
the ability to resist stress and to adopt to a changing
microenvironment. These tumor cells have distinctly different
growth factor pathways and antiapoptotic responses compared with the vast majority of cancer cells. Long-term
therapeutic success can only be achieved by identifying and
targeting factors and signaling cascades that help these cells
survive during stress. Both microarray and immunohistochemical analysis on human prostate cancer tissue samples
have shown an increased expression of vascular endothelial
growth factor-C (VEGF-C) in metastatic prostate cancer. We
have discovered that VEGF-C acts directly on prostate cancer
cells to protect them against oxidative stress. VEGF-C
increased the survival of prostate cancer cells during
hydrogen peroxide stress by the activation of AKT-1/protein
kinase BA. This activation was mediated by mammalian target
of rapamycin complex-2 and was not observed in the absence
of oxidative stress. Finally, the transmembrane nontyrosine
kinase receptor neuropilin-2 was found to be essential for the
VEGF-C–mediated AKT-1 activation. Indeed, our findings
suggest a novel and distinct function of VEGF-C in protecting
cancer cells from stress-induced cell death, thereby facilitating
cancer recurrence and metastasis. This is distinctly different
from the known function of VEGF-C in inducing lymphangiogenesis. [Cancer Res 2009;69(15):6042–8]

Introduction
The increased ability of tumor cells to survive under stress is
important for cancer progression, subsequent metastatic transformation, and therapy resistance (1). The stress can be incurred by
the microenvironment surrounding the cancer cells and/or by
therapeutic interventions used to treat cancer (2). Alternative
growth factor pathways and adaptive up-regulation of antiapoptotic mechanisms are the primary causes for cancer cells to evade
death during unfavorable conditions (3). Reactive oxygen species

(ROS) and cellular oxidative stress have long been understood to be
associated with cancer, although this association is often complex
and paradoxical (4). Oxidative stress may induce cancer, and
receptor tyrosine kinase–activated cell cycle progression often
involves an increase in ROS signaling (3, 5). On the other hand, the
antioxidant system in cancer cells increases paradoxically as
transformed cells generate higher level of ROS compared with
normal cells (6). Indeed, several therapeutic agents promote cell
death by increasing oxidative stress (7, 8). Several agents, including
radiotherapy, chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel, histone
deacetylase inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, as well as redox
cycling agents, increase oxidative stress (6, 9). This common effect
suggests that cancer cells are more vulnerable to oxidant stress
because they function with an enhanced basal level of ROSmediated signaling (10). Therefore, by further increasing the ROS
level by these therapeutic agents, cancer cells are pushed beyond
the breaking point of damaging cellular organelle and DNA and
undergo apoptosis. Thus, a recurrence of the tumor after therapy
likely results from a subset of cells that have developed the ability
to overcome oxidative damage (3, 9). These cells also acquire a
metastatic phenotype, which becomes the major cause of death
due to the cancer (1, 2).
The tumor microenvironment, which is highly heterogeneous in
terms of nutrient supply, pH, and oxygenation, plays a major role in
the ability of tumor cells to resist stress by altering gene expression
and cellular functions of cancer cells (11, 12). The presence of
inflammatory cells, myofibroblasts, and endothelial cells in the
tumor microenvironment supports not only the growth of tumor
cells but also its ability to resist stress and therefore facilitates
metastasis (11). The metastatic cascade is thus orchestrated by
signals from both a tumor and its microenvironment. In this
context, the growth factors and cytokines that facilitate communication between the tumor cells and the stromal compartment are
particularly important. For instance, members of the vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene family are known to execute
a functional communication between the tumor cell and its
surrounding environment (13, 14).
VEGF-C seems to be particularly unique among the VEGF family
members (15, 16) because of its involvement in the lymph node
metastasis (17). Several studies have reported a significant
correlation between the expression of VEGF-C and lymph node
metastases in human prostate carcinoma (18–21). The cancer
microarray profile database Oncomine also describes a significant
up-regulation of VEGF-C mRNA in human metastatic prostate
cancer tissue specimens (22, 23). VEGF-C functions by activating
its cognate tyrosine kinase receptors VEGF-R3 (Flt4; ref. 24)
and VEGF-R2 (KDR) and the nontyrosine kinase receptor neuropilin-2 (NRP-2; ref. 25). These receptors were identified initially
on lymphatic endothelial cells (26), and one of the known

VEGF-C Protects Cancer Cells from Oxidative Stress

functions of VEGF-C is to promote the formation of new lymphatic
vessels by inducing the proliferation, migration, and sprout
formation of existing lymphatic endothelial cells, a process called
lymphangiogenesis (27). It has been postulated that, by inducing
lymphangiogenesis, VEGF-C facilitates lymph node metastasis (28).
Furthermore, several reports now point to functions for VEGF-C,
which are independent of lymphangiogenesis and instead are
important for cancer progression. For example, VEGF-C can
stimulate the proliferation and migration of Kaposi’s sarcoma cells
and also the proliferation and survival of leukemia cells (29). Lack of
lymphangiogenesis has been reported in uveal melanoma despite
high VEGF-C expression (15). More importantly, VEGF-C is often
overexpressed in glioblastoma patients, although brain tissue is void
of lymphatics (30). In a recent report, it has been postulated that the
risk of childhood neuroblastoma treatment failure (progression or
relapse) as well as tumor-related death was found to be significant in

www.aacrjournals.org

VEGF-C–positive patients (31). VEGF-C has also been suggested to
be a trophic factor for neural progenitors in the vertebrate
embryonic brain (32). An autocrine function of VEGF-C to promote
the invasion and metastasis of lung, breast, and gastric cancers has
also been reported (33–35).
In this study, we have identified a survival-promoting function of
VEGF-C on prostate cancer cells under severe oxidative stress
conditions. We have also delineated the underlying molecular
mechanism for this stress-resistant function of VEGF-C, which
involves the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin
complex-2 (mTORC-2) and AKT-1. The nontyrosine kinase VEGFC receptor NRP-2 was identified as an upstream component in this
pathway. Our findings therefore provide a novel mechanism by
which VEGF-C protects cancer cells from stress-induced cell death.
It also sheds new light on the upstream events of mTORC-2
activation.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP (American Type
Culture Collection), LNCaP C4-2 (ViroMed Laboratories), and PC3
(American Type Culture Collection) were cultured at 37jC in RPMI 1640
with L-glutamine (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and containing either 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories,
Fisher Scientific). Cells were serum starved overnight before adding
recombinant wild-type VEGF-C (R&D Systems, Inc.) for 9 h. After 4 h of
VEGF-C incubation, hydrogen peroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) at different
concentration was added for another 5 h.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot assay. Immunoprecipitation
was performed with 0.75 mg of total cellular protein from whole-cell
extracts with antibody (1 Ag) directed against mTOR (Cell Signaling
Technology) and pulled down by protein A-agarose beads (PfizerPharmacia). Western blots were conducted using antibodies against
phospho–AKT-1 (Ser473; Upstate-Millipore), phospho-AKT (Thr308), AKT-1,
phospho–glycogen synthase kinase-3h (GSK-3h), phospho–FOXO-1,
4EBP-1, S6, mTOR, rictor, phospho–4EBP-1, phospho-S6 (Cell Signaling
Technology), GSK-3h (BD Biosciences), NRP-2 (R&D Systems), rho-GDI
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and h-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Apoptosis assay. Vybrant Apoptosis Assay Kit #7, purchased from
Molecular Probes-Invitrogen Detection Technologies, was used according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, LNCaP and LNCaP C4-2 cells (2  106
per well, six-well plate) were serum starved overnight followed by
recombinant VEGF-C and hydrogen peroxide addition as mentioned in
‘‘Cell Culture’’ section of Materials and Methods. PC3 cells were transfected
with VEGF-C–specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) for 72 h followed by
hydrogen peroxide treatment for 5 h. Adherent cells were washed with PBS
and incubated with 1 AL each of Hoechst 33342 stock solution, YO-PRO-1
stock solution, and propidium iodide (PI) stock solution at 37jC in an
atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 15 min. The cells were viewed under a
fluorescence microscope using appropriate filters. The apoptotic cells were

stained with green fluorescent YO-PRO-1 dye and the dead cells were
stained with red fluorescent PI dye. The blue fluorescent Hoechst 33342
stains the chromatin of the cells.
Cell transfections with siRNA against NRP-2 and VEGF-C. Cells were
transfected with siRNA for NRP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and VEGF-C
(Dharmacon RNA Technologies) as published using DharmaFECT 2/3
(Dharmacon RNA Technologies). siRNA transfection was allowed to proceed
72 h before collection of whole-cell extract or total RNA.
Development of VEGF-C–expressing stable clones of LNCaP C4-2.
Mature form of VEGF-C–expressing plasmid (pSecTag2BDNDCVEGF-C, a
kind gift from Dr. Mihaela Skobe, Mount Sinai School of Medicine,
New York, NY) was transfected to LNCaP C4-2 cells. For vector-only control,
pSecTag2B plasmid with no insert was transfected in parallel to another set
of LNCaP C4-2 cells. Cells were selected with zeocin. Multiple stable clones
of LNCaP C4-2 cell line expressing varying levels of VEGF-C will be isolated
for subsequent experiments.

Results and Discussion
VEGF-C receptors are expressed in prostate cancer cells.
Receptors for VEGF-C have been characterized on several cancer
cells (34, 36), suggesting the possibility of cancer cell–specific
functions of VEGF-C. We have detected the VEGF-C receptor
NRP-2 in prostate cancer cell lines such as LNCaP, LNCaP C4-2,
and PC3 (Fig. 1A). LNCaP C4-2 is a hormone-refractory or
castration-recurrent prostate cancer cell and is more metastatic
than its syngeneic parental cell line LNCaP. This cell line was
developed by isolating tumor cells from the regional lymph nodes
after injecting LNCaP cells orthotopically into castrated mice (37).
LNCaP C4-2 cells are not dependent on androgen for their
growth, although they express androgen receptor. PC3 cells

VEGF-C Protects Cancer Cells from Oxidative Stress

were isolated from a site of bone metastasis. These cells do
not express androgen receptor. Both PC3 and LNCaP C4-2
express higher levels of NRP-2 compared with LNCaP. The other
known VEGF-C receptors, VEGF-R3 and VEGF-R2 (data not
shown), were detectable in significantly lower levels in LNCaP
and LNCaP C4-2.
VEGF-C increases prostate cancer cell survival under
oxidative stress. The presence of VEGF-C receptors on prostate
cancer cells led us to look for a cancer cell–specific function of
VEGF-C. LNCaP C4-2 was selected initially because it is an
androgen-responsive and androgen receptor–expressing prostate
cancer cell line that recapitulates many features of hormonerefractory human prostate cancers. This cell line also expresses
high levels of the VEGF-C receptor NRP-2, which we subsequently identified to be critical for VEGF-C function. We have
observed an increase in apoptosis of LNCaP C4-2 cells when
incubated for 5 hours with increasing concentrations of H2O2
(Supplementary Fig. S1). To investigate the survival-promoting
role of VEGF-C, we first incubated serum-starved LNCaP C4-2
cells with increasing concentrations of recombinant VEGF-C (9
hours; R&D Systems). After 4 hours of VEGF-C addition, cells
were treated with a fixed dose of H2O2 (3mmol/L) for the
remaining 5 hours. Cell death was measured by the YO-PRO-1/PI
apoptosis assay using fluorescence microscopy. Our results (Fig.
1B and C) suggested that prior addition of VEGF-C to these cells
protects them from H2O2-induced cell death in a dose-dependent
manner. In this respect, it should be noted that LNCaP C4-2
and its syngeneic parental line LNCaP express low level of
endogenous VEGF-C, which showed moderate protection ability
against a much lower (0.25 mmol/L) concentration of H2O2

(data not shown). Therefore, the endogenous VEGF-C present
in LNCaP C4-2 cells in our experimental conditions (as described
in Fig. 1B and C) was not sufficient to protect cells against high
levels of H2O2. We added exogenous VEGF-C for the following
reason. It is known that, in solid tumors, VEGF-C is secreted by
both tumor cells and inflammatory cells present in the tumor
stroma (38). Therefore, the total level of VEGF-C should be
higher than that secreted by the cancer cells alone. Equivalent
concentrations of VEGF-C have been used by other investigators
(39), who showed that these concentrations of VEGF-C are
physiologically relevant.
VEGF-C restores activation of AKT-1 in prostate cancer cells
under oxidative stress. To evaluate the signaling pathways
important for VEGF-C–mediated survival in prostate cancer
cells under oxidative stress, we tested the regulation of AKT
as a downstream event. We observed a decrease in the
phosphorylation status of AKT-1 (at Ser473 and Thr308) in LNCaP
C4-2 cells treated for 5 hours with increasing concentrations
of H2O2 (Fig. 2A and B; Supplementary Fig. S2). Prior incubation
with VEGF-C abrogated the AKT-1 inactivation (Fig. 2A), supporting the survival-promoting function of VEGF-C as described
in the previous result. No decrease in phospho–AKT-1 levels by
H2O2 treatment was also observed when mature form of VEGF-C
was stably overexpressed in LNCaP C4-2 cells (Fig. 2B; relative
expression levels of VEGF-C in the stable clones of C4-2
are described in Supplementary Fig. S3). These results emphasize
the importance of VEGF-C in up-regulating AKT-1 phosphorylation
in prostate cancer cells during oxidative stress. It is important to
note that VEGF-C–mediated AKT-1 phosphorylation was observed
only under oxidative stress conditions, as we detected no increase

the remaining 9 h. These cells were

5 h of the experiment. Whole-cell lysates
were subjected to an immunoblot.

in phosphorylation of AKT-1 in the absence of H2O2 in LNCaP C4-2
cells when incubated with either recombinant VEGF-C or stably
overexpressing mature VEGF-C (Fig. 2A and B). The importance of
this finding is confirmed by the fact that the AKT signaling cascade
is considered a key determinant of tumor aggressiveness and an
attractive target for therapeutic intervention (40). In addition,
cancer cells expressing constitutively active AKT are more resistant
to chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel and cisplatin than
cancer cells expressing low levels of AKT (41).

Phosphorylation of FOXO-1 (at Thr24) and GSK-3h (at Ser9),
both downstream targets of AKT-1, was also retained in VEGF-C–
treated cells (Fig. 2A). FOXO-1, a known inducer of apoptosis,
loses its activity on phosphorylation by AKT-1 (42). GSK-3h is a
mediator of c-Flip–mediated apoptosis (43), and thus, inactivation
of GSK-3h by phosphorylation suggests an antiapoptotic function
of VEGF-C.
Interestingly, VEGF-C could not restore the decrease in phosphorylation of S6 and 4EBP-1, two downstream targets of AKT-mTOR

VEGF-C Protects Cancer Cells from Oxidative Stress

complex-1 (mTORC-1) pathway in H2O2-treated prostate cancer
cells (Fig. 2C). Although it is not clear why those proteins are
not phosphorylated by VEGF-C under oxidative stress despite
the presence of active AKT-1, an explanation might come from
the observation that oxidative stress can block mTORC-1 activity
downstream of AKT-1 (44). Therefore, the inactivation of mTORC-1
during severe stress may have biological significance. The
major functions of mTORC-1 are protein synthesis and cellular
growth (45). It is possible that during severe stress, cells prefer
to shut off the energetically expensive processes such as protein
synthesis and growth and enhance cellular processes that
mediate cell survival. Again, one of the downstream targets of
mTORC-1 is S6 kinase, which apart from activating its substrate S6 is
also involved in a negative feedback loop to inactivate AKT-1 (46).
Therefore, the absence of mTORC-1 activity facilitates prolonged
activation of AKT-1 during severe stress and thus provides a better
survival advantage.
mTORC-2 is responsible for AKT-1 activation under
oxidative stress. To understand the molecular pathway of VEGFC–mediated stress resistance in prostate cancer cells, we studied
the upstream events required for Ser473 phosphorylation of AKT-1.
Ser473 phosphorylation of AKT was previously reported to be an
excellent predictor of poor clinical outcome in prostate cancer
(47). One of the important upstream candidates is the multiprotein
complex mTORC-2, which has shown to be necessary for prostate
cancer development (46, 48). Accordingly, we tested the involvement
of mTORC-2 in the VEGF-C–induced restoration of AKT-1 activation
under ROS stress. We studied the association of mTOR and
rictor, two important components of mTORC-2, in C4-2 cells
treated with 3 mmol/L H2O2 alone or in the presence of increasing
doses of VEGF-C. A decrease in association of mTOR with
rictor in prostate cancer cells was observed when treated with
H2O2 alone (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, prior incubation with VEGF-C
restored the complex formation even in the presence of H2O2,
suggesting a role of VEGF-C in maintaining mTORC-2 under stress
(Fig. 3A). The total expression level of mTOR and rictor was not
influenced by the addition of H2O2 and/or VEGF-C (Fig. 3A, bottom).
Next, we knocked down the expression of rictor using specific siRNA
to inactivate mTORC-2 in prostate cancer cells and monitored
VEGF-C–induced Ser473 phosphorylation of AKT-1 under ROS stress.
Recombinant VEGF-C failed to restore phospho–AKT-1 levels when
rictor was knocked down (Fig. 3B). These results together with
the results in Fig. 3A suggest the involvement of mTORC-2 in
this pathway and rule out any significant contribution of other
signaling pathways for VEGF-C–mediated Ser473 phosphorylation
of AKT-1 in prostate cancer cells during oxidative stress. Recent
report also indicated the involvement of mTORC-2 for the
progression of prostate cancer (48), underscoring the significance
of our study.
NRP-2 mediates VEGF-C–induced AKT-1 activation. To
identify the VEGF-C receptor/s in this pathway, we showed
interest in NRP-2 because of its involvement in resisting metabolic
stress (49). Furthermore, the Oncomine database showed an
increased expression of NRP-2 in human metastatic prostate
cancer tissues (23). Knocking down NRP-2 in LNCaP C4-2 cells
failed to rescue phospho–AKT-1 levels by VEGF-C when treated
with 3 mmol/L H2O2 (Fig. 3C and D). Thus, our results show the
involvement of NRP-2 in VEGF-C–mediated AKT-1 activation.
Because NRP-2 is a nontyrosine kinase receptor and has a very
short cytoplasmic tail, it is widely believed that it cooperates with
other tyrosine kinase receptors to induce downstream signaling

events (50). Currently, the identity of the tyrosine kinase receptor,
if any, in this process is unknown.
VEGF-C restores activation of AKT-1 in LNCaP and PC3
cells under oxidative stress. Finally, we also checked the
VEGF-C-AKT-1 axis in other prostate cancer cells such as LNCaP
and PC3. Similar to LNCaP C4-2 cells, a dose-dependent recovery
of LNCaP cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis was observed
with increasing concentrations of VEGF-C (Fig. 4A, right ;
Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5). We also observed the phosphorylation of AKT-1 and its downstream target GSK-3h in LNCaP
cells by the addition of recombinant VEGF-C during oxidative
stress (Fig. 4A, left). Interestingly, unlike LNCaP C4-2, we only
observed this restoration of phosphorylation at the lower
concentrations of H2O2 (1 mmol/L; Fig. 4A; Supplementary
Fig. S6). The differences between LNCaP and C4-2 cells might be
due to different NRP-2 expression levels in these two cell lines
(Fig. 1A). NRP-2 expression is significantly higher in C4-2 cells
and therefore should be more potent in resisting stress by
VEGF-C.
Finally, we tested the stress-resistant function of VEGF-C in a
highly metastatic prostate cancer cell line, PC3, which not only
expresses high level of NRP-2 but also synthesizes significant levels
of endogenous VEGF-C. Decrease in phospho–AKT-1 levels in PC3
cells by H2O2 was observed only at higher concentrations (7.5 and
10 mmol/L; Fig. 4B, left). As expected, a rapid decrease in AKT-1
phosphorylation in PC3 cells with increasing concentrations of
H2O2 occurred (Fig. 4B, left) when endogenous expression of VEGFC was knocked down by siRNA (10 nmol/L). A significant increase
in apoptosis in PC3 cells was also observed when endogenous
VEGF-C was knocked down (Fig. 4B, right; Supplementary Fig. S7)
along with the decrease in phosphorylation of FOXO-1 and GSK-3h
(Fig. 4C), confirming the requirement of VEGF-C in resisting ROS
stress in PC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S8 for the efficiency of
VEGF-C knocking down in PC3 by siRNA).
In conclusion, we have determined a novel function of
VEGF-C, which promotes survival of prostate cancer cells under
oxidative stress, as schematically represented in Fig. 4D. Involvement of NRP-2 in this function of VEGF-C is intriguing because of
its higher expression in metastatic prostate cancer. Because
other cancers such as glioblastoma, osteosarcoma,1 and several
epithelial cancers also express higher levels of VEGF-C and
NRP-2, it is possible that the VEGF-C/NRP-2/AKT-1 axis is involved
in the recurrence of those cancers as well, a possibility that should
