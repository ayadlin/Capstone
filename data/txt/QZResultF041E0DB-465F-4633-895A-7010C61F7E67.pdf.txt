Abstract
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating mutations
in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) responds to
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib. However,
secondary somatic EGFR mutations (e.g., T790M) confer
resistance to erlotinib. BMS-690514, a novel panHER/vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor described here, exerted antiproliferative and proapoptotic
effects on NSCLC cell lines, with prominent efficacy on
H1975 cells expressing the T790M mutation. In this model,
BMS-690514 induced a G1 cell cycle arrest, as well as
ultrastructural hallmarks of apoptosis, mitochondrial release
of cytochrome c, and activation of caspases involved in the
intrinsic (e.g., caspase-2, caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9),
but not in the extrinsic (e.g., caspase-8), pathway. Caspase
inhibition conferred partial protection against BMS-690514
cytotoxicity, pointing to the involvement of both caspasedependent and caspase-independent effector mechanisms.
Transcriptome analyses revealed the up-regulation of proapoptotic (e.g., Bim, Puma) and cell cycle inhibitory (e.g.,
p27Kip1, p57Kip2) factors, as well as the down-regulation of
antiapoptotic (e.g., Mcl1), heat shock (e.g., HSP40, HSP70,
HSP90), and cell cycle promoting [e.g., cyclins B1, D1, and D3;
cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1); MCM family proteins;
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)] proteins. BMS690514–induced death of H1975 cells was modified in a unique
fashion by a panel of small interfering RNAs targeting
apoptosis modulators. Down-regulation of components of
the nuclear factor-KB survival pathway (e.g., p65, Nemo/IKK;,
TAB2) sensitized cells to BMS-690514, whereas knockdown of
proapoptotic factors (e.g., Puma, Bax, Bak, caspase-2, etc.) and
DNA damage–related proteins (e.g., ERCC1, hTERT) exerted

cytoprotective effects. BMS-690514 is a new pan-HER/VEGFR
inhibitor that may become an alternative to erlotinib for the
treatment of NSCLC. [Cancer Res 2007;67(13):6253–62]

Introduction
Most patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, the most
frequent cancer in males) present at an inoperable stage, with a
poor prognosis (1). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a
receptor tyrosine kinase that is aberrantly activated in several
epithelial solid tumors, and notably in NSCLC (2). Overexpression
of the gene coding for EGFR has been found in 40% to 80% of
NSCLC biopsies, and has been correlated with shorter survival
after surgical resection (3). Activating mutations of EGFR may
render NSCLC cells independent from external growth factors (4),
converting EGFR into an attractive therapeutic target (5). For the
treatment of NSCLC, small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (EGFR-TKI), like erlotinib (Tarceva) and gefitinib
(Iressa), have been evaluated (6). However, only erlotinib prolonged
the survival of patients with recurrent NSCLC (7). In particular, a
subset of patients carrying EGFR-activating mutations exhibited
encouraging responses to EGFR-TKIs (8). The deletion DE746-A750
in exon 19 and the leucine-to-arginine substitution at position 858
(L858R) in exon 21 account for 85% of NSCLC-related EGFR
mutations (9). Deletions in exon 19 are associated with better
responses to EGFR-TKIs and prolonged overall survival, compared
with activating mutations in exon 21 (i.e., L858R; ref. 10).
Nevertheless, secondary mutations, including the threonine-tomethionine substitution at position 790 (T790M, in exon 20) and
the aspartate-to-tyrosine substitution at position 761 (D761Y, in
exon 19), have been reported in lesions progressing after treatment
with EGFR-TKIs (11). At present, it is not clear whether the T790M
mutation is present in a small fraction of tumor cells before
treatment (12) or whether it arises de novo (13). Recently, it has
been shown that alternative EGFR-TKI inhibitors retain the ability
to promote apoptosis in gefitinib-resistant cancer cells (14).
EGFR signaling is linked to multiple intracellular pathways that
inhibit apoptosis and promote survival and proliferation. Upon
ligand-induced activation, EGFR generates phosphotyrosine sites
for the recruitment of Ras and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase,
setting off the classic mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt
pathways (15). Moreover, several members of the signal transducer

and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcriptional
factors (e.g., STAT1, STAT3, STAT5a, and STAT5b) can be activated
by EGFR (16). Interestingly, the inhibition of STAT3 promotes
apoptosis in cells expressing mutant EGFR (17).
Apoptosis is an accurately regulated program by which vertebrates eliminate superfluous, ectopic, and damaged cells (18, 19),
as well as one of the mechanisms through which chemotherapeutics
kill cancer cells (20). The cell death program is at least partially
suppressed during oncogenesis, thus favoring chemotherapy and
radiotherapy resistance (21, 22). Apoptosis can be distinguished
from other cell death subroutines by means of morphologic criteria,
including chromatin condensation (pyknosis) and nuclear fragmentation (karyorhexis; refs. 23, 24). Cells that succumb to apoptosis
eventually break down into membrane-enclosed bodies, which,
in vivo, are engulfed by resident phagocytic cells and usually fail to
elicit inflammatory/immune responses (23, 25).
Apoptosis may be executed via the extrinsic pathway, which
emanates from the extracellular environment and is propagated
along the ‘‘death receptors ! death-inducing signaling complex !
caspase-8’’ axis (26–28), or through an intracellular cascade of
events that involves mitochondria (intrinsic pathway; refs. 29, 30).
In this case, proapoptotic signals from several subcellular compartments (e.g., the nucleus, the endoplasmic reticulum, etc.) are
transmitted to mitochondria where they promote mitochondrial
membrane permeabilization, often through the activation of
proapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family (22, 31). After mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, cytotoxic proteins that normally
reside in the intermembrane space are liberated into the cytosol,
and can either favor directly the activation of the caspases, as does
cytochrome c (32), or promote apoptosis in a caspase-independent
fashion (33), as do apoptosis-inducing factor (34–36) and
endonuclease G (37).
In the present article, we report the characterization of a novel
panHER/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)
inhibitor, BMS-690514, that exerts antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on NSCLC cell lines, in particular on cells that are
resistant to erlotinib due to the T790M mutation. In addition, we
describe the mechanisms through which BMS-690514 exerts is
cytostatic and cytotoxic effects.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, culture, and treatments. A549 cells [wild-type (wt) EGFR
and p53] were grown in F12-K medium containing L-glutamine, supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin G sodium, and 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin sulfate. H1299 cells (wt EGFR, inactive p53 R175H),
H1650 cells (bearing a deletion in exon 19 of the EGFR gene, i.e., DE746A750, and wt p53), and H1975 cells (EGFR L858R/T790M and wt p53)
were maintained in RPMI 1640 with GlutaMAX supplemented with
10% FCS and antibiotics (as above). For proliferation and cytotoxicity
assays based on 96-well plates, all cell lines were cultured in DMEM/F12
(1:1) with L-glutamine but no phenol red supplemented with 10% FCS
and antibiotics. Media and supplements were purchased from Life
Technologies-Invitrogen.
For fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, 20  103 to 25 
3
10 cells were seeded in 12-well plates 12 h before the treatment with BMS690514 (Bristol Myers Squibb), in the presence or absence of the pancaspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp.fluoromethylketone
(Z-VAD-fmk, 25 Amol/L, from Bachem) or of the nuclear factor-nB
(NF-nB) inhibitor Bay 11-7082 (10 Amol/L, from Sigma-Aldrich).
For transcriptome analysis, 1  105 to 2  105 cells were seeded in sixwell plates, allowed to adhere for 12 h, and then left untreated or treated
with 5 Amol/L (1 Amol/L) BMS-690514 or 50 Amol/L (25 Amol/L) cis-

diammineplatinum(II) dichloride [cisplatin (CDDP), from Sigma-Aldrich]
for an additional 48 h (24 h). Thereafter, cells were harvested, lysed for the
extraction of RNA, and processed to analyze gene expression, as previously
reported (38).
For proliferation assays, 1  103 to 3  103 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates 12 h before the treatment with BMS-690514 or erlotinib (Tarceva,
from Sequoia). When the sequential administration of BMS-690514 and
CDDP was investigated, cells were treated with 5 Amol/L BMS-690514 for
24 h (48 h) before the administration of 10 Amol/L CDDP for additional
48 h (24 h) or vice versa. In both cases, treatments lasted a total of 72 h,
after which plates were analyzed for cell proliferation.
For transmission electron microscopy, H1975 cells were treated for
48 h with 5 Amol/L BMS-690514, then fixed and processed as previously
reported (39).
Cell proliferation assays. Cell proliferation was quantified by means of
a colorimetric assay based on the reduction of the colorless tetrazolium salt
4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate (WST-1, from Roche) to formazan (which exhibit an absorbance peak
around 450 nm), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Small interfering RNA transfections. Detailed information on the
small interfering RNAs (siRNA) can be found in Supplementary Materials
and Methods. For 96-well plates based proliferation assays, A549 and
H1975 cells were transfected while seeded, as follows. siRNA (300 pmol)
dissolved in 2.1 mL of serum-free, antibiotic-free, DMEM:F12 (1:1) with
L-glutamine but no phenol red were mixed with 63 AL of HiPerFect
transfection reagent (Qiagen) dissolved in 2.1 mL of the same medium
and allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min. Thereafter, transfection complexes were added to f2.35  105 cells suspended in 7.8 mL
of DMEM/F12 (1:1) with L-glutamine but no phenol red supplemented
with 10% FCS and antibiotics. The resulting cell suspension was seeded
into a 96-well plate (f3,500 cells in 100 AL of medium per well).
Transfected cells were cultured for 48 h before the administration of
BMS-690514 (25 and 70 Amol/L for H1975 and A549 cells, respectively) or
CDDP (70 Amol/L for both cell lines). Finally (after a total of 72 h), plates
were analyzed for cell proliferation.
For FACS analysis, H1975 cells were reverse transfected after a slightly
modified protocol. One hundred picomoles of siRNA (unrelated, caspase-2,
p65) dissolved in 92 AL of serum-free, antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 with
GlutaMAX were mixed with 8 AL of HiPerFect transfection reagent, and
allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min. Then, transfection
complexes were added to 105 cells suspended in 1.9 mL of RPMI 1640 with
GlutaMAX supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics, and the resulting
suspension was seeded into six-well plates. After 48 h (to allow for protein
down-regulation), cells were harvested and transferred to 12-well plates
(30  103 to 40  103 per well). Upon adhesion to the plate, cells were
retransfected with the siRNAs originally used (to grant for persistent downregulation) by means of the HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen), in this
case following the manufacturer’s instructions. Simultaneously, cells were
treated or not with 5 Amol/L BMS-690514. After an additional 48 h, cells
were subjected to cytofluorimetric analysis of viability and Dw m
dissipation.
Data treatment and statistical analysis. All experiments were done in
duplicates or triplicates, and repeated at least twice. Data are reported as
means F SE. Statistical significance was evaluated by means of paired
Student’s t test. The assay-independent indicator D was introduced to allow
for normalization among different assays, and to analyze the effects of
siRNAs per se separately from their influence on drug-induced cell death.
A precise mathematical definition of D may be found in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Cytofluorometric analysis and immunofluorescence. Cells were
stained with the following probes to assess apoptosis-associated modifications: propidium iodide (1 Ag/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) for viability and
dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide [DiOC6(3), 40 nmol/L, Molecular ProbesInvitrogen] for Dw m dissipation (40). Caspase-3 activation was measured by
staining with an FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody specific for active
caspase-3 (Becton Dickinson). After overnight fixation of the cells in glacial
70% ethanol, DNA content was quantified by staining with propidium

iodide (50 Ag/mL) and RNase (10 Ag/mL, Roche) for 30 min at room
temperature. All cytofluorimetric analyses were done using a FACScan
equipped with Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson).
For immunofluorescence studies, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde
(4% w/v in PBS) followed by staining with antibodies for the detection of
cytochrome c (mouse monoclonal IgG anti-cytochrome c; BD PharMingen)
and active caspase-3 [rabbit polyclonal anti caspase-3 (Asp175); Cell
Signaling Technology]. Nuclei were counterstained with 10 Ag/mL Hoechst
33342 (Molecular Probes-Invitrogen). Primary antibodies were revealed
either with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 (green) or with
goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 568 (red) from Molecular ProbesInvitrogen. Fluorescence microscopy determinations were done by means
of a Leica IRE2 microscope equipped with a Leica DC300F camera.
Analysis of protein expression. Protein samples of H1975 cells were
prepared in lysis buffer, according to standard established protocols (41).
Extracted proteins (50 Ag/lane) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and
subjected to immunoblots using mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibodies
specific for caspase-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), active caspase-8,
phosphorylated EGFR (Cell Signalling Technology), or glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Chemicon International) and rabbit
polyclonal antibodies against caspase-3, caspase-7, active caspase-9 (Cell
Signalling Technology), total EGFR, or the p65 subunit of NF-nB (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Membranes were then incubated with secondary goat antimouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Southern
Biotech) before revelation with ECL Detection kit and Hyperfilm X-ray films
(both from Amersham Pharmacia).

Results and Discussion
BMS-690514 kills erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells by apoptosis. BMS-690514 is a novel specific inhibitor of EGFR, exhibiting an
in vitro IC50 of f5 nmol/L.11 At higher concentrations, it acts also
on other members of the EGFR family (i.e., Erb-B2 and Erb-B4, with
an IC50 of f20 and f60 nmol/L, respectively) as well as on
VEGFR2 (IC50 of f50 nmol/L).11 BMS-690514 inhibits the
proliferation of NSCLC cell lines, showing a marked effect on the
H1975 cell line that expresses an EGFR mutation (T790M) that is
associated with clinical resistance against erlotinib. The antiproliferative effect of BMS-690514 on H1975 cells was obtained at an
IC50 of f1 Amol/L, which is 10-fold lower than the IC50 of erlotinib
(Fig. 1A). It was associated with a marked increase in cells
manifesting signs of apoptosis including the dissipation of the
mitochondrial transmembrane potential [Dw m, as assessed by
staining with the potential-sensitive probe DiOC6(3)] and the
permeabilization of the plasma membrane (as measured by
staining with the vital dye propidium iodide). H1975 cells (EGFR
L858R/T790M, wt p53) were by far more sensitive to BMS-690514
than H1650 (EGFR DE746-A750, wt p53), H1299 (wt EGFR, inactive
p53), and A549 (wt EGFR, wt p53) NSCLC cell lines (Fig. 1B).
Transmission electron microscopy revealed that H1975 cells transit
from a normal morphology (Supplementary Fig. S1A) to full-blown
apoptosis when treated with BMS-690514. After an initial swelling
of the Golgi apparatus (Supplementary Fig. S1B ) and the
accumulation of pseudomyelinic figures in the cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D), the three defining hallmarks of
apoptosis, namely nuclear condensation (pyknosis, Supplementary
Fig. S1E) and fragmentation (karyorhexis, Supplementary Fig. S1F),
and apoptotic blebbing (Supplementary Fig. S1G) became manifest.
Then, the dying cells either were phagocytosed by yet alive

neighbors (Supplementary Fig. S1H) or underwent secondary
necrosis (Supplementary Fig. S1I). In conclusion, BMS-690514
induces the apoptotic demise of H1975 NSCLC cells.
Cellular effects of BMS-690514: cell cycle inhibition and
induction of the mitochondrial caspase activation pathway. To
characterize the mechanisms through which BMS-690514 kills
H1975 cells, we determined its transcriptional effects at a
preapoptotic stage, measured at 24 h (at a dose of BMS-690514,
5 Amol/L, which kills 50% of the cells after 48 h of incubation) or at
48 h (at a dose of BMS-690514, 1 Amol/L, which kills 50% of the
cells after 72 h of incubation). All data obtained by microarray
analysis have been submitted to Array Express at the European
Bioinformatics Institute12 with the accession number E-TABM-239
(42). At 24 h, BMS-690514 caused the up-regulation of f250 genes
and the down-regulation of f500 genes by a factor >2, with a
profile that was markedly different from that induced by CDDP
(Fig. 2A; see also Supplementary Table S1). Hence, part of the
changes in the transcriptome are specific for BMS-690514 and do
not reflect a general property of apoptosis in H1975 cells. Of note,
BMS-690514 suppressed the expression of several cell cycle–
associated proteins (cyclins B1, D1, and D3; CDK1; members of
the minichromosome maintenance family, i.e., MCM-3, MCM-4,
MCM-6, MCM-7, and MCM-10; PCNA), whereas it induced two
CDK1 inhibitors CDKN1B (p27kip1) and CDKN1C (p57kip2; Fig. 2B).
In the same conditions, BMS-690514 led to a G1 cycle arrest
(Fig. 3A) that preceded the overt induction of apoptosis recorded
after 72 h (Fig. 1B). This has important consequences on the
antitumor response mediated by the DNA-damaging agent CDDP.
Because CDDP preferentially kills proliferating cells, it loses its
cytotoxic activity when added to short-term BMS-690514–pretreated (and hence G1 arrested) cells. In contrast, BMS-690514
mediates cytotoxic/antiproliferative effects even after pretreatment
with CDDP, as shown in experiments in which CDDP and BMS690514 were added in different orders to H1975 cells (Fig. 3B).
BMS-690514 influenced several genes that are involved in the
mitochondrial cell death pathway. It induced several transcripts
whose products can induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, namely the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins from the Bcl2 family Bim (by a factor of 3) and Bbc3/Puma (by a factor of 2.5)
as well as p53AP1 (by a factor of 2). In addition, BMS-690514
down-regulated several cytoprotective proteins: the antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 homologue Mcl-1 and several members of the HSP family
(HSP40, HSP70, HSP90; Fig. 2B). In this context, it may be noteworthy that HSP90 promotes the stability of mutant EGFR and
that the use of HSP90 inhibitors (like the geldanamycin derivative
17-AAG) may represent a novel approach for the therapy of
NSCLC (43).
BMS-690514 induced signs of the mitochondrial apoptosis
pathway. Thus, H1975 cells treated with BMS-690514 manifested
the release of cytochrome c and subsequent caspase-3 activation, as
determined by two-color immunofluorescence staining, immunoblotting, and cytofluorimetric quantification (Fig. 4A–C). BMS690514–activated caspases that contribute to the mitochondrial
pathway (including caspase-2, caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9;
Fig. 4B), yet failed to induce the proteolytic maturation of caspase-8,
which characterizes the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis (Fig. 4B).

dephosphorylation of EGFR promoted by BMS-690514; it also did
not (or very slightly) affected the BMS-690514–mediated downregulation of EGFR (Fig. 4D). This correlated with the transcriptional effects of BMS-690514 on various chaperons of the HSP
family, some of which have been implicated in the internalization
and degradation of EGFR (43).
siRNA screening of cell death modulators reveals the
importance of Bcl-2 family proteins and NF-KB for BMS690514–induced killing. To further explore the mechanisms
accounting for BMS-690514 cytotoxicity, we transfected a panel of

influence on the antiproliferative effects mediated by BMS690514. To this aim, transfected cells were treated with BMS690514 for 24 h, before the assessment of proliferation by a
tetrazolium salt reduction assay. The effect of each siRNA was
evaluated by comparing the residual proliferation, as measured
upon the treatment with BMS-690514, to the level observed in
untreated (transfected) cells (Fig. 5A and B). Results were then
compared with the negative control provided by an irrelevant,
‘‘unrelated’’ siRNA. In H1975 cells, several siRNAs attenuated the
cytotoxic effects of BMS-690514. This applies in particular to
siRNAs targeting proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family

proliferation was assessed by an assay
based on the reduction of the tetrazolium
salt WST-1. The switch between the two
treatments was done either at 24 h (left)
and at 48 h (right ). Control cultures were
administered with medium (M ) only. For
each panel, the proliferation of treated
cultures was normalized to that of control
cells subjected to the exchange of the

(Puma, Bax, Bak, Bid, Bad), sessile proapoptotic mitochondrial
proteins (ANT3, PBR), as well as caspases and their activators
(caspase-2, Apaf-1; Fig. 5C). In contrast, the knock down of
components of the NF-nB–activating system (p65, Nemo/IKKg,
TAB2) sensitized H1975 cells to death mediated by BMS-690514
(Fig. 5C). It is important to note that the profile of siRNAmediated modulation of BMS-690514 cytotoxicity, as obtained in
H1975 cells, was rather specific and hence very different from
that observed for another cell death inducer (CDDP) on the same
cell line, or that observed for a cell line bearing wt EGFR (A549)
treated with either BMS-690514 or CDDP (Fig. 5C and D). Using
a different readout, namely the cytofluorimetric quantification of
dying [DiOC6(3)low] and dead (propidium iodide positive) cells,
we could confirm that the knock down of caspase-2 reduced the
lethal effect of BMS-690514 on H1975 cells, whereas that of the
NF-nB subunit p65 sensitized to BMS-690514 (Fig. 6A and B).
Similarly, inhibition of the NF-nB–activating kinase IKK1 with
BAY 11-7082 sensitized to cell death induction by BMS-690514

by the NF-nB system.
Concluding remarks. Clinical data indicate that EGFR-targeted
therapies may provide advantages over traditional chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. However, objective responses are limited to a subset of patients who
invariably develop resistance against currently available EGFR-TKIs
such as erlotinib and gefitinib. Novel EGFR-TKI overcoming drug
resistance might represent important weapons in the fight against
cancer.
As shown here, BMS-690514 was able to arrest proliferation
and/or to induce apoptosis in all tested NSCLC cell lines, although
at different levels of potency. Importantly, BMS-690514 exhibited
a prominent effect on cells affected by the T790M mutation of
EGFR, which confers resistance against erlotinib. The proapoptotic
effects of BMS-690514 were only partially counteracted by the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, suggesting the involvement of
caspase-dependent as well as of caspase-independent mechanisms
in BMS-690514–mediated killing. Accordingly, BMS-690514 was

able to elicit the proteolytic maturation of several caspases
involved in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (e.g., caspase-2,
caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9), as determined by immunoblotting. On the other hand, caspase-8, which is specifically linked
to the activation of death receptors, was not activated. Moreover,

siRNA-mediated down-regulation of caspase-2 provided partial
protection against BMS-690514–induced cell death. It has been
previously reported that caspase-2 is necessary for the death of
PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons induced by withdrawal of
obligate trophic factors (44–46). Interestingly, our results point

of the band corresponding to the active fragment(s) (A ). C, H1975 cells were incubated with BMS-690514 at the indicated concentration (in the absence or

again to the involvement of caspase-2 in the lethal pathways
emanating from inhibited transmembrane growth factor receptors.
BMS-690514 sensitized NSCLC cells to the antiproliferative and
proapoptotic activity of CDDP, the most frequently chemotherapeutic agent used for the treatment of NSCLC. This synergistic
effect was only seen when BMS-690514 was administered after
CDDP, and not vice versa. The fact that CDDP lost its effects on
BMS-690514–pretreated cells can be explained by the G1-arresting
effect of BMS-690514, which reduces the fraction of cells in the
S phase (the preferential target of CDDP toxicity). Altogether, these
results point to the possibility of performing combination chemo-

therapies with improved efficacy, using an appropriate schedule of
sequential drug administrations.
siRNA-mediated knock down of several proteins with an
established role in apoptosis indicates that BMS-690514 activates
the intrinsic, mitochondrial pathway leading to cell death. BMS690514 did not induce any death receptors nor their ligands (and
did not promote the proteolytic activation of caspase-8), yet
changed the balance between antiapoptotic and proapoptotic
members from the Bcl-2 family (by reducing Mcl-1 and inducing
Bim, Puma, and Bad) at the transcriptional level. Accordingly,
siRNA-mediated depletion of several BH3-only proteins from the

Bcl-2 family (Puma, Bad) or of two of the proapoptotic
multidomain members of the family (Bax or Bak, but in particular
the combination of both) reduced the cytotoxic effect of BMS690514. Finally, cells treated with BMS-690514 manifested signs of
mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, including the partially
caspase-dependent release of cytochrome c and Dw m dissipation.
Surprisingly, our siRNA screening revealed that the downregulation of ERCC1, which in NSCLC constitutes both a positive
prognostic marker and a predictive factor for the sensitivity to
CDDP-based adjuvant chemotherapy (47), reduced the lethal
effects of BMS-690514. Similarly, we found that the depletion of
other proteins involved in the DNA damage response or telomere
maintenance (FANCC, FAND2, Chk1, and hTERT) also reduced
BMS-690514 cytotoxicity, through hitherto unexplored mechanisms. This suggests that NSCLC that overexpress ERCC1 or
hTERT might be particularly amenable to the treatment by BMS690514 or similar agents. Our siRNA screening also led to
identification of a series of targets whose depletion sensitized to
BMS-690514. Several among these targets are involved in the

antiapoptotic NF-nB pathway, and inhibition of NF-nB might
indeed increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to BMS-690514.
In conclusion, BMS-690514 and its analogues might constitute
an addition to the armamentarium of EGFR-TKIs used to fight
NSCLC. As shown here, BMS-690514 can act on cells that are
resistant to the Food and Drug Administration–approved EGFRTKI erlotinib by exerting both cytostatic and cytotoxic activities,
the latter involving the activation of the mitochondrial cell death
pathway.
