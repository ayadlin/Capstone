Abstract
Successful chemotherapy accounts for both tumor-related factors and host immune response. Compelling
evidence suggests that some chemotherapeutic agents can induce an immunogenic type of cell death
stimulating tumor-specific immunity. Here, we show that cyclophosphamide (CTX) exerts two types of actions
relevant for the induction of antitumor immunity in vivo: (i) effect on dendritic cell (DC) homeostasis, mediated
by endogenous type I interferons (IFN-I), leading to the preferential expansion of CD8aþ DC, the main subset
involved in the cross-presentation of cell-derived antigens; and (ii) induction of tumor cell death with clear-cut
immunogenic features capable of stimulating tumor infiltration, engulfment of tumor apoptotic material, and
CD8 T-cell cross-priming by CD8aþ DC. Notably, the antitumor effects of CTX were efficiently amplified by IFNI, the former providing a source of antigen and a "resetting" of the DC compartment and the latter supplying
optimal costimulation for T-cell cross-priming, resulting in the induction of a strong antitumor response and
tumor rejection. These results disclose new perspectives for the development of targeted and more effective
chemoimmunotherapy treatments of cancer patients. Cancer Res; 71(3); 768–78. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Many clinical studies based on the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy have been published over the
past years showing variable responses (1). Indeed, chemotherapy may be either immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive
depending on the dosage and the timing of administration and
may synergize with immunotherapy approaches in vivo (2–4).
In addition, most chemotherapeutic agents induce tumor cell
death by apoptosis, a process that has long been regarded as
immunologically "silent" (5). However, recent evidence suggest
that some anticancer drugs, such as anthracyclines, induce an
immunogenic type of apoptosis that stimulates the engulfment of apoptotic bodies by dendritic cells (DC) and the
activation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells through a process known as
"cross-priming" (6). Elicitation of immunogenic cell death by
chemotherapeutics is characterized by a series of events that

include preapoptotic surface translocation of calreticulin
(sCRT), which serves as an "eat me" signal for phagocytes,
and the release of high-mobility group box1 protein (HMGB1)
in the extracellular milieu, whose binding to TLR4 on DC
triggers adaptive antitumor responses (7, 8).
Cyclophosphamide (CTX), one of the most widely used
alkylating agents for the treatment of hematologic and solid
malignancies, has been appreciated for its immunomodulatory
properties (9). Numerous mechanisms have been suggested for
CTX-induced immunomodulatory effects, including the induction of a Th2/Th1 shift in cytokine production (10), the reduction of tumor-induced suppressor T-cell frequencies (11), the
enhancement of long-term survival and proliferation of lymphocytes (12), and the induction of a variety of soluble mediators
(9). Among cytokines induced by CTX, type I interferons (IFN-I)
mediate many of the effects ascribed to the drug, including the
expansion of memory T lymphocytes (12) and the activation of
CD11bþ myeloid cells (13). Moreover, the efficacy of combined
CTX-immune cell therapy in murine tumors was shown to be
strictly dependent on endogenous IFN-I (14, 15). Recent studies
suggest that CTX immunopotentiating activity can also involve
systemic mobilization of DC (16–18), although the impact of
these homeostatic rearrangements on DC–tumor interaction
remains elusive. One critical feature of DC for inducing efficient
antitumor response is the capacity to cross-present tumorassociated antigens (Ag) and to cross-prime cytotoxic T cells, a
process requiring appropriate activation stimuli (19, 20).
Among signals capable of "licensing" DC, IFN-I have been
described to stimulate DC activation, homeostasis, migration,

CTX and IFN-I Synergism in DC-Driven Antitumor Response

T-cell priming, and cross-priming (21–25). Indeed, IFN-I are
cytokines with a long record of clinical use for the treatment of
several types of malignancies due to their capacity to exert
antitumor activity through multiple mechanisms (26).
Here, we analyzed the local and systemic effects of CTX in
mice bearing OVA-expressing EG7 thymoma (EG7) and the
synergism with IFN-I. We show that CTX-stimulated systemic
DC homeostasis requires IFN-I and results in a preferential
expansion of CD8aþ DC. Locally, CTX induces an immunogenic tumor apoptosis, characterized by sCRT exposure and
release of soluble factors, among which HMGB1, capable of
activating CD8aþ DC, efficiently takes up tumor apoptotic
cells and cross-present the EG7-derived OVA both in vitro and
at the tumor site. Finally, we show that CD8 T-cell crosspriming by DC and CTX-induced antitumor effect in vivo can
be strongly enhanced by IFN-I.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Rauscher virus-transformed RBL-5 lymphoma cells, originally obtained from Dr. Ion Gresser (Centre de Recherches
Biomédicales des Cordeliers, Paris, France), and EL-4 lymphoma cells, obtained by American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, TIB-39), were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium,
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum,
2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 0.1 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 0.05 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol. EG.7-OVA cells
(EG7; obtained from ATCC, CRL-2113) are OVA-transfected
EL4 cells and were cultured in similar medium supplemented
with 0.4 mg/mL G418 (Calbiochem). OVA expression on MHCI molecules of EG7 cells was routinely checked by flow
cytometry. B16-F10 melanoma cells (obtained from ATCC;
CRL-6475) were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's
medium complete medium. Each cell line was routinely tested
for morphology, growth curve, and absence of Mycoplasma
and passaged for no more than 5 times from thawing.
Reagents and mice treatments
Mafosfamide [(MAFO) 4-sulfoethylthio-cyclophosphamide
L-lysine; Niomech–IIT GmbH] was used at 10 mmol/L. CTX
(Sigma) was injected i.p. 100 mg/kg when tumor size reached
around 12-mm diameter. High-titer mouse IFN-I (1.5  106 U/
mg protein) was produced as described elsewhere (27) and
was either added to cell cultures (5  103 IU/mL) for 18 hours
or injected peritumorally (105 IU) daily for 4 days starting from
day 1 post–CTX treatment. C57BL/6, OT-1 (Charles River), and
IFNAR/ mice (Dr U. Kalinke, Paul Enrich Institute, Langen,
Germany) were manipulated in accordance with the local
Ethical Committee guidelines.
Bone marrow DC precursor analysis and culture
Bone marrow (BM) cells were collected at various times
post-CTX treatment and surface stained for detection
of DC precursors (DCP) as lineage markers (Lin)
MHC-IICD11cþB220þ, LinMHC-IICD11cþB220, and
LinFlt3/CD135þ and then analyzed by FACS. For in vitro
DC differentiation, BM cells were labeled with 1 mmol/L

www.aacrjournals.org

carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Invitrogen) and then cultured in medium containing 10 ng/mL
rmGM-CSF (Peprotech). At various culture times, BM DC were
surface stained for CD11c and analyzed by FACS.
Analysis of tumor-infiltrating DCs
For FACS, tumor-infiltrating DC (TIDC) were detected as
CD3CD19CD11cþI-Aþ cells. For confocal laser-scanning
microscopy (CLSM), frozen tumor tissue sections were fixed
in acetone and stained with anti-CD11c, anti-I-Ad/I-Ed, antiCD86, anti-MHC-I-OVAp, or Isotype. CLSM observations were
done with a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS apparatus. Signals from
different fluorescent probes were taken in sequential scan
settings, and colocalization was detected in yellow.
Detection of apoptosis and immunogenicity
characterization
For apoptosis detection in vivo, mice were injected i.v. with
green fluorescent FLIVO reagent (FAM-VAD-FMK; Immunochemistry Technologies) and sacrificed 30 minutes later.
Examination of labeling in the tumor mass was done by FACS
of cell suspensions or CLSM analysis of tumor tissue sections.
Immunogenic cell death of MAFO-treated EG7 cells in vitro
was assessed by sCRT and CD31 expression by FACS and by
HMGB1 release in cell culture supernatants (snt) by Western
blotting. DC activation by MAFO-conditioned medium was
assessed by FACS and by release of IL-6 and IL-1b. For in vivo
assessment of immunogenic apoptosis, MAFO-treated EG7
cells were injected s.c. (30  106) into 1 flank of C57BL/6 mice.
One week later, mice were challenged with live tumor cells
(5  106) by subcutaneous injection into the opposite flank.
Phagocytosis of apoptotic EG7 tumors and crosspriming of CD8 T cells by DCs
For uptake analysis, DC were cocultured with apoptotic
CFSE-labeled EG7 cells at a 1:4 ratio for 18 hours in the
presence of IFN-I (5  103 U/mL) or mock and then analyzed
by FACS. For proliferation assays, DC were cocultured with
apoptotic EG7 (EG7-DC) or EL4 cells (EL4-DC), with or without IFN-I, FACS sorted, and then cultured with OT-1 CD8 T
cells. 3H-Thymidine incorporation was measured at the third
day of culture. Ag-specific IFN-g production by CD8 T cells
was assessed by ELISPOT assay following manufacturers’
instruction (Mabtech AB).
Statistical analysis
Levels of significance for comparison between samples
were determined by the 2-tailed Student's t test. P values less
than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

mobilization remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effect
of a single injection of a lymphodepleting, nonmyeloablative
dose of CTX (100 mg/kg), still retaining direct antitumor
effects (Supplementary Fig. S1), on DCP in EG7 tumor-bearing
mice. As shown in Figure 1A, CTX determined a transient
depletion of total BM cells that was mostly evident at day 3
postinjection (p.i.) but not of upstream CD135þLinIACD11c DCP and downstream LinI-ACD11cþB220þ
and B220 DCP (28, 29), which instead were significantly
increased in the relative frequency (Fig. 1B and C). This effect
was independent on the presence of the tumor burden
(Fig. 1D). During the recovery phase (day 7–8 p.i.), when
BM cell numbers increased (Fig. 1A), the rates of DCP returned
similar to those found in untreated controls (Fig. 1B). These
findings suggest that DCP are more resistant to low-dose CTX
than other immune cell progenitors.
To investigate the proliferative and differentiation potential
of DCP, we cultured CFSE-labeled BM cells with GM-CSF
(granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor) and analyzed CFSE dilutions along with CD11c expression, as a
marker for DC differentiation, at different times of culture.

Days of culture

Consistent with the higher frequency of DCP, BM cells from
day 3 CTX–treated mice generated DCs more rapidly with
respect to controls, as determined by higher percentage of
CFSElowCD11cþ cells appearing in BM cultures (Fig. 1E). As
expected, cultures of BM isolated at day 1 or at day 9 post–
CTX treatment yielded DC with similar kinetics as compared
with controls (Fig. 1E). In the periphery, CTX treatment
determined a transient depletion of conventional DC subsets
(CD8aþ and CD8a), but not of plasmacytoid DC, followed by
massive de novo generation of DC resulting in the preferential
expansion of the CD8aþ DC subset, confirming previous
reports (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table I;
refs. 16–18).
IFN-I critically mediate CTX-induced DC mobilization
from BM
We addressed the role of IFN-I in the CTX-induced modulation of DC homeostasis. First, we analyzed IFN-a and IFN-b
gene expression in the BM, where mobilization of DCP originates, and found significant upregulation of both genes in
CTX-treated mice, as compared with controls, by day 3 and up

to day 10 p.i. (Fig. 2A). Next, we examined DC generation
potential in BM cells of IFNAR/ animals at different times
post—CTX treatment. Remarkably, lack of IFN-I signals
strongly reduced CTX-induced DC differentiation from BM
precursors in vitro, as revealed by similar CD11cþCFSElow cells
retrieved in cultures from CTX-treated (day 3 p.i) and salinetreated IFNAR/ mice at the various time points (Fig. 2B). In
contrast, BM cells from day 3 CTX-treated wild-type (WT)
animals displayed significantly increased DC yield throughout
all culture times, with respect to saline-treated controls
(Fig. 2B). Notably, the reduced DC differentiation potential
of BM cells from day 3 CTX-treated IFNAR/ mice did not
reflect a different frequency of LinCD135þ DCP at that time
with respect to CTX-treated WT mice (Fig. 2C). Collectively,
these findings indicate that IFN-I signaling is critically
required for CTX-induced DC mobilization.
Induction of immunogenic tumor apoptosis by CTX
To investigate the effect of CTX on tumor cell death, we
injected EG7 tumor-bearing mice with the fluorescent dye
FLIVO, which binds to active caspases, allowing in vivo
detection of apoptosis at different times post–CTX treatment.
Remarkably, CTX largely increased the levels of apoptotic
tumor cells with almost 80% of FLIVO positivity at day 3 p.
i., as opposed to control animals showing background tumor

apoptosis (30%–35%; Fig. 3A). The analysis of tumor sections
confirmed a widespread distribution of FLIVOþ cells in CTXtreated mice (Fig. 3B). Notably, cell suspensions from tumor
explants of CTX-treated animals failed to survive when placed
in culture, whereas those from control mice were viable and
proliferated considerably (Fig. 3C).
To characterize the parameters of tumor apoptosis immunogenicity, we took advantage of the in vitro active CTX
derivative MAFO. We found that sCRT was clearly expressed
in MAFO-treated EG7 (MAFO-EG7) cells (PI gate), as
compared with live tumor cells, at 4 hour and up to 48 hour
post-treatment and at levels comparable with those found in
UV-irradiated (UV-EG7) cells, a positive control for sCRT
expression (Fig. 3D). Consistently, sCRT translocation was
paralleled by downregulation of the "don't eat me" signal CD31
(Fig. 3D). As a key parameter of cell death immunogenicity,
closely related to DC activation, we measured the levels of
extracellular HMGB1 in snt of MAFO-EG7 cells (8). Notably,
both MAFO-treated and UV-irradiated EG7 cells released
substantial HMGB1 (Fig. 3E). We also measured HMGB1 in
snts of RBL-5 lymphoma and B16 melanoma, two cell lines
displaying differential sensitivity to MAFO in vitro and to CTX
in vivo (data not shown) and found both cell lines releasing
HMGB1 following MAFO treatment, although B16 cells did so
at lower levels than EG7 and RBL-5 (Fig. 3E and F).

Finally, to confirm the immunogenicity of MAFO-induced
apoptosis in vivo, we tested MAFO-treated EG7 cells as a
tumor vaccine. Strikingly, mice immunized with MAFO-EG7
cells were protected from a subsequent tumor challenge with
live EG7 cells (Fig. 3G). Interestingly, vaccination with UV-EG7
cells did not protect mice from challenge, inducing only a
delay in tumor progression with respect to controls (Fig. 3H).
These results strongly indicate that the CTX derivative MAFO
induces an immunogenic type of apoptosis.

Because immunogenic signals of cell death promote the

cells were engulfed by CD8aþ DC more efficiently than UVEG7 cells, as shown by twice higher percentages of CFSEþ cells
(Fig. 4A). To test whether dying tumor cells released DCactivating signals, we added snts from UV-EG7 or MAFO-EG7

the survival of CD8aþ DC, as revealed by higher frequency of
these cells after culture (Fig. 4D). No DC phenotypic changes
or cytokine release was observed when MAFO was added
directly to DC (data not shown), indicating that DC activation was mediated through the release of soluble factors by
tumor cells after MAFO killing. Of interest, DC-activating
signals were released by MAFO-treated RBL-5, but not B16
cells, as revealed by phenotype and inflammatory cytokine
release in DC on exposure to culture snt (Supplementary
Fig. S3).
Apoptotic cell uptake by DC and CD8 cross-priming are
strongly enhanced by IFN-I
CD8aþDCs are specialized for cross-presentation of dead
cell–derived Ag; however, appropriate activation signals are
needed to license DC for cross-priming (30, 31). We asked
whether IFN-I could act as such signal-stimulating DC for CD8
T-cell cross-priming against MAFO-EG7–derived Ag. Remarkably, in the presence of IFN-I, DC showed enhanced uptake of
MAFO-EG7 cells, as indicated by 2-fold higher percentage of
CD8aþCFSEþ cells than mock-treated DC (Fig. 5A). Of note,
IFN-I neither affected the levels of apoptosis nor affected those
of sCRT on MAFO-treated tumor cells (data not shown).
Addition of IFN-I to apoptotic cells/DC cultures induced

phenotypic activation and higher levels of MHC-I-OVA peptide complexes on Ag-bearing CD8aþ DC (Fig. 5B). Consistent
with the enhanced phagocytosis and the more mature phenotype, IFN-treated DC were more efficient at inducing OT-1
CD8 T-cell cross-priming, as revealed by higher proliferation
(Fig. 5C) and by major frequencies of IFN-g–producing cells
with respect to mock-treated DC (Fig. 5D). As expected,
neither proliferative response nor IFN-g–forming spots were
observed when DC loaded with MAFO-treated EL4 cells were
used as stimulators, indicating the Ag specificity of CD8 T-cell
response (Fig. 5C and D).
CTX alters the tumor microenvironment promoting DC
infiltration and subsequent homing to lymph node
Next, we analyzed whether the induction of immunogenic
apoptosis and the consequent changes in tumor architecture
by CTX could influence DC tumor infiltration. Notably, a more
than 8-fold increase in TIDC could be observed at day 7 in
CTX-treated mice, with respect to untreated controls, coinciding with the peak of systemic DC expansion (Fig. 6A and B;
Supplementary Fig. S2). A qualitative analysis of tumor sections by CLSM revealed that almost all TIDC detected in
tissues from CTX-treated, but not saline-treated, mice displayed an activated phenotype, as indicated by colocalization
of CD11c with CD86 and MHC-II molecules (Fig. 6C–F;
Supplementary Fig. S4). Of great interest, CTX-treated tumors
displayed colocalization of CD11c with MHC-I-OVAp complexes, suggesting that TIDCs were phagocytic and, possibly,
cross-presenting EG7-derived OVA peptides on MHC-I molecules (Fig. 6G and H; Supplementary Fig. S4).

To test whether enhanced tumor infiltration by DC in
response to CTX was driven by local alterations in chemokine
balance, we analyzed the intratumoral expression of selected
chemokines and chemokine receptors involved in leukocyte
trafficking (32). All genes analyzed were significantly upregulated 3 days post–CTX treatment, as compared with controls,
supporting a scenario of a tumor microenvironment favoring
DC and T-cell infiltration (Fig. 6I). Moreover, the antiangiogenic ligand–receptor pair CXCL10/CXCR3 was also upregulated in CTX-treated mice, suggesting an additional effect of
this drug in the inhibition of angiogenesis (Fig. 6I).
Because kinetic analysis of TIDC showed only transient
tumor infiltration by these cells, which returned to the levels of
controls by day 10 post–CTX treatment (Fig. 6B), we hypothesized that after entering the tumor site, DC quickly migrate to
draining lymph node (dLN). Thus, we injected FITC as a cell
tracker intratumorally at the time of maximum tumor infil-

774

tration (day 7 post–CTX treatment) and investigated the
homing of TIDC to dLN. Strikingly, in CTX-treated animals,
a considerable percentage of FITCþCD11cþ cells migrated to
dLN but not to contralateral LN (cLN; Fig. 6J). In contrast,
FITCþ DC were barely detectable in dLN from saline-treated
mice (Fig. 6J).
Synergistic antitumor effect of CTX and IFN-I in vivo
Finally, we attempted to combine systemic CTX treatment
with peritumoral IFN-I administration to cure mice bearing
established EG7 tumors. Notably, combined CTX/IFN treatment significantly delayed tumor development and cured 60%
of mice with no tumor recurrence (Fig. 7A and B). Similar
beneficial effect of combined CTX/IFN regimen was observed
with mice implanted with RBL-5 tumors (Fig. 7C). As
expected, mice exposed to CTX or IFN-I alone were not cured
and died within 40 days (Fig. 7A to C). Importantly, mice

Discussion
Most chemotherapeutics induce tumor cell death by apoptosis, which has been generally assumed to be immunologically silent (4). However, recent data suggest that some drugs
can induce an immunogenic kind of apoptosis that stimulates
antitumor immune responses contributing to tumor eradication (6, 33). Here, we have shown for the first time that CTX
can induce a widespread tumor apoptosis with strong immunogenic features. The immunogenicity of CTX-induced cell
death is shown by several observations. First, the translocation
of CRT on the dying cell membrane as an "eat me" signal for
DC paralleled by the downregulation of the "don't eat me"
signal CD31 after treatment with the in vitro active CTX

www.aacrjournals.org

analogue MAFO (7). Second, the release of soluble factors,
among which the alarmin protein HMGB1, promoting the
activation and survival of CD8aþ DC. Third, the efficient
engulfment of MAFO-killed EG7 cells by CD8aþ DC, which
subsequently cross-presented tumor-derived OVA peptides on
MHC-I molecules in vitro and in vivo. In this regard, it is
intriguing that, despite expressing similar sCRT levels, MAFOkilled EG7 were engulfed more efficiently than UV-irradiated
cells by DC. This observation suggests either that additional
"eat me" and/or "find me" signals may be expressed by MAFOEG7 cells or that DC upregulate one or more phagocytic
receptors on contact with MAFO-conditioned medium (34).
Fourth, when injected into immunocompetent mice, MAFOEG7 cells protected mice from a subsequent challenge with
live tumor cells. Similarly, it was reported that tumor cells
exposed to anthracyclines release strong DC-activating signals, causing immunogenic cross-presentation (8).

Although DC loaded with MAFO-EG7 cells could stimulate
CD8 T-cell cross-priming, the addition of IFN-I greatly
enhanced this process. In agreement with the in vitro results,
IFN-I administered in vivo strongly synergized with CTX for
tumor eradication. Because IFN-I treatments were done in the
local tumor microenvironment, we foresee that the beneficial
effect of the cytokines may reflect an action at the DC–tumor
interface. In this regard, it has been shown that intratumoral
administration of IFN-a strongly synergizes with systemic
immunotherapy for the induction of antitumor response
involving enhanced DC cross-presentation (35). It is worth
noting that the effectiveness of combined CTX/IFN therapy
strongly correlates with susceptibility of tumor cells to CTX/
MAFO-induced immunogenic cell death. In fact, RBL-5 lymphoma cells, which are sensitive to CTX-mediated immunogenic cell death, are susceptible to combined therapy in vivo.
In contrast, B16 melanoma cells, which fail to undergo immunogenic apoptosis after MAFO exposure, are resistant to CTX/
IFN therapy in vivo (data not shown).
Because of systemic cytotoxic effects, CTX affects lymphopoiesis and myelopoiesis, perturbing the homeostatic balance
of immature myeloid cells such as DC and myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (16–18). Our results show that CTX, at nonmyeloablative doses, despite inducing transient reduction of
total BM cells (16, 36), spares DCP, which, instead, increase in
their relative frequency (day 3 p.i.), allowing a more rapid
replenishment of the peripheral DC compartment. Consis-

tently, previous reports showed that promyelocytic precursor
cells are less sensitive to sublethal doses of CTX than other
BM progenitors and that BM cultures from low-dose CTXtreated mice yield higher numbers of DC (37, 38). In contrast,
higher doses of CTX (200 mg/kg) were shown to deplete DCP
in BM of tumor-bearing mice, thus supporting the concept of a
dose-dependent sensitivity of DCP to chemotherapy (17).
Remarkably, CTX-mediated DCP mobilization critically
required endogenous IFN-I, induced soon after CTX treatment
systemically (12, 13) and in the local BM environment. Recent
reports showed that IFN-I reactivate dormant hematopoietic
stem cells, promoting their proliferation and mobilization
in vivo (39, 40). In addition, IFN-I can directly stimulate the
turnover of DC in vivo, especially of CD8aþ DC, and promote
the generation of DC from BM precursors (21, 24). Our
findings support the role of IFN-I in homeostasis, with
crucial implications for patients undergoing myelodepleting
regimens, as concomitant treatment with IFN-a could accelerate recovery of immune competence (25). Importantly,
although IFN-I induction by CTX is not sufficient for tumor
eradication, it is necessary for restoring immune cell pools
because the immunopotentiating activity of the drug and
the effectiveness of combined CTX/immunotherapies were
shown to require endogenous IFN-I to succeed (14, 15, 41). In
this regard, because IFN-I was recently shown to reduce
regulatory T cell (Treg) function through stimulation of Agpresenting cells, it is conceivable to speculate a role for

CTX and IFN-I Synergism in DC-Driven Antitumor Response

endogenous IFN-I in mediating the effects of CTX on Treg
ablation (42).
Another interesting finding reported herein is the enhanced
tumor infiltration by DC following CTX treatment. Although
we cannot rule out the possibility that TIDC were recruited
locally from the skin, it is intriguing that these cells appeared
at the tumor site at the peak of DC frequency in lymphoid
organs (day 7). The role of TIDC in tumor eradication is
currently a matter of debate, although it seems that the
maturation state of TIDC may crucially dictate the outcome
of effector CTL responses and a positive correlation of mature
TIDC with longer survival of tumor patients has been reported
in clinical studies (43–45). Remarkably, in tumor tissues from
CTX-treated, but not saline-treated, animals almost all TIDC
displayed a mature phenotype, revealed by CD86 and MHC-II
expression, and expressed MHC-I-OVAp complexes. Of note,
the presence of CD11cþ DC coexpressing MHC-I-OVAp is
indicative not only of active phagocytosis of dying tumor cells
by TIDC but may also suggest cross-presentation of EG7derived OVA. The appearance of TIDC in CTX-treated mice
correlated with an intratumoral chemokines/chemokine
receptors milieu supporting leukocyte recruitment and trafficking, as revealed by early intratumoral upregulation of
CXCR3 and CCR5, and also of CXCL12, CCL19, CCL20, and
CXCL10 (32, 46, 47). Interestingly, it has been reported that the
interaction between CXCR3 and its ligands and the progressive increase in CXCL10 intratumoral expression critically
inhibit angiogenesis, thus suggesting a possible role for
CTX in this phenomenon (32, 46, 48).
After the peak of tumor infiltration, considerable numbers
of DC migrated to tumor dLN in CTX-treated mice (day
10 p.i.). Ag-bearing DC migrating from peripheral tissues to
dLN can either directly present the carried Ag to naive T cells
or hand over the antigenic cargo to LN-resident DC (49). It has
been proposed that migratory DC, rather than CD8aþ DC,
retain more immunogenic features, thus enhancing immune
responses in naive CTX-treated mice (18). However, our data
on Ag cross-presentation by CD8aþ DC and CD8 T-cell crosspriming argue against the assumption that these cells may be
tolerogenic, at least in a setting where tumor-derived antigenic material and immunogenic signals are made available

for DC due to CTX cytotoxic activity. Thus, we propose that on
CTX-induced tumor death, activated DC leave the tumor
microenvironment and migrate to dLN, where they either
directly present or transfer tumor Ag to resident CD8aþ DC,
previously expanded by CTX, to initiate antitumor responses.
In this scenario, coadministration of IFN-I in the local intratumoral milieu functions as a powerful signal that licenses DC
for efficient cross-priming.
Altogether, our data indicate that CTX, on one hand,
induces an immunogenic apoptosis within the tumor mass
that acts as priming event for the induction of antitumor
immunity through the release of large amounts of antigenic
material and soluble factors recruiting and activating DC into
the tumor bed, and, on the other hand, resets the host immune
system, creating an excellent stage for homeostatic expansion
of DC pools. Because of the powerful capability to promote
DC-mediated CD8 T-cell responses and to exert synergistic
therapeutic antitumor effect in vivo, IFN-I represent promising
candidates for combination therapies with CTX for the development of more effective immunotherapy protocols for cancer patients.
