Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Genome instability is a hallmark of cancer cells. Chromosome instability (CIN), which is often
mutually exclusive from hypermutation genotypes, represents a distinct subtype of genome
instability. Hypermutations in cancer cells are due to defects in DNA repair genes, but the cause of
CIN is still elusive. However, because of the extensive chromosomal abnormalities associated
with CIN, its cause is likely a defect in a network of genes that regulate mitotic checkpoints and
chromosomal organization and segregation. Emerging evidence has shown that the chromosomal
decatenation checkpoint, which is critical for chromatin untangling and packing during genetic
material duplication, is defective in cancer cells with CIN. The decatenation checkpoint is known
to be regulated by a family of enzymes called topoisomerases. Among them, the gene encoding
topoisomerase IIα (TOP2A) is commonly altered at both gene copy number and gene expression
level in cancer cells. Thus, abnormal alterations of TOP2A, its interacting proteins, and its
modifications may play a critical role in CIN in human cancers. Clinically, a large arsenal of
topoisomerase inhibitors have been used to suppress DNA replication in cancer. However, they
often lead to the secondary development of leukemia because of their effect on the chromosomal
decatenation checkpoint. Therefore, topoisomerase drugs must be used judiciously and
administered on an individual basis. In this review, we highlight the biological function of TOP2A
in chromosome segregation and the mechanisms that regulate this enzyme's expression and
activity. We also review the roles of TOP2A and related proteins in human cancers, and raise a
perspective for how to target TOP2A in personalized cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Chromosome instability (CIN) is one of the hallmarks of cancer cells1 and is often mutually
exclusive from hypermutation genotypes. Hypermutations in cancer cells are due to defects
in DNA mismatch repair genes, including MLH1 and MSH2;2 however, the cause of CIN is
still elusive. Most solid tumor cells with CIN are aneuploidy, indicating that abnormal
mitosis is involved in the CIN phenotype. The process of mitosis is precisely regulated. The
sequence of events is divided into six stages (prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase,
and telophase) corresponding to the completion of one set of activities and the start of the
next. During mitosis, the pairs of chromatids condense and attach to spindles that pull the
sister chromatids to opposite sides of the cell, each cell receives chromosomes that are alike
in composition and equal in number to the chromosomes of the parent cell. The decatenation
and mitotic checkpoints govern sister chromosome segregation. Topoisomerase IIα
(TOP2A) is a key player in the decatenation checkpoint; when the decatenation checkpoint
is defective, chromosomal mis-segregation is observed. CIN can provide these evolving cell
subclones with a mechanism that causes unremitting genomic and mutational plasticity.
Furthermore, the decatenation checkpoint deficiency can cause additional chromosome
imbalances in cancer cells, increasing tumour aggressiveness (Figure 1).

In this review, we discuss the biological function of TOP2A in chromosome segregation and
CIN. We also assess the mechanisms that may regulate this enzyme's expression and activity
and shed light on the roles of TOP2A in human cancer progression and personalized cancer
therapy.

CHROMOSOME INSTABILITY AND CANCER

Author Manuscript

CIN involves the unequal distribution of DNA to daughter cells upon mitosis, resulting in
the loss or gain of chromosome during cell division, and ultimately, aneuploidy. Aneuploidy
can be driven by genetic alterations that promote inaccurate chromosome segregation, which
often causes whole chromosomes to be lost or gained. This condition is termed whole
chromosome instability. In addition to numerical chromosomal abnormalities, cancer cells
can show changes in chromosome structure, such as deletions of chromosome arms and
amplifications of large chromosome regions. This condition is termed structural or
segmental chromosomal instability.3
Recently, CIN was recognized as a distinct feature of most aggressive cancer types (Figure
2). In normal organisms, the integrity of the chromosome number and structure are essential
to maintaining survival. Aneuploidy, in the form of large or local chromosomal changes, is
more evident and unique in human cancer. Aneuploidy is distinct from polyploidy; in
polyploidy, cells contain more than two complete sets of chromosomes but always have an

exact multiple of the haploid number, so the chromosomes remain balanced. Cancer cells
not only have numerous gene mutations but are also characterized by aneuploidy and CIN.2
Whether CIN is a driver or passenger of cancer is a subject of debate in cancer research.
Most researchers believe that CIN is an early event in tumor formation that causes the
deletion or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes through defects in genome maintenance
and destabilization of the nucleotide sequence;1,4,5 other researchers argue that CIN is a side
effect of neoplastic growth and cell division, during which cancer cells frequently lose and
gain chromosomes.6

To better define the role of CIN in cancer, it is important to understand the molecular basis
of tumorigenesis. Genome alterations in cell subclones confer advantages on outgrowth and
lead to the subclones’ dominance in the local tissue environment. CIN is a cell-autonomous
feature that provides evolving cell subclones with a mechanism that causes unremitting
genomic and mutational plasticity, leading to increased cell survival, cell proliferation, and
tumorigenesis.7 In essence, CIN drives tumor progression by accelerating the gain of
oncogenic loci and the loss of tumor suppressor loci. Therefore, other subclones that have
chromosomal alternations but do not have this kind of gain and loss will not acquire tumorpromoting features. Finally, multistep tumor progression can proceed because of the
succession of subclone expansions. Comparative genomic hybridization, which can
document the gains and losses of gene copy numbers across the cell genome, provides clear
evidence of the loss of control of chromosome integrity in tumor progression.8 The
development of next-generation DNA-sequencing technologies has led to the detection of
widespread destabilization of gene copy numbers and nucleotide sequences.9,10 Defects in
genome maintenance systems cannot detect and resolve these abnormal genome alterations1.
Therefore, favorable genotypes accumulate in subclones or premalignant cells. Accordingly,
CIN is likely the primary cause and driving force of tumorigenesis and progression.11

CHROMOSOME SEGREGATION AND CIN

Author Manuscript

The chromosomal changes that cause CIN commonly occur during tumor cell division.2
Over 100 genes are involved in sister chromosome segregation in humans, and defects in
some of the genes that control this segregation are found in cancer cells.6,12 The mitotic
checkpoint plays a prominent role in chromosome segregation. This checkpoint is a control
mechanism that ensures high-fidelity chromosome segregation. One of the key steps is
regulated by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). APC/C is a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls mitotic progression and sister chromosome
segregation. APC/C activation requires cell-division-cycle 20 (CDC20) as a co-activator to
modulate the ubiquitination and degradation of mitotic substrates, including securin and
cyclin B1.13 Degradation of securin releases the sequestering partner, separase. Active
separase can cleave the cohesin links that hold the sister chromatins together. Degradation of
cyclin B1 leads to the inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and initiates mitotic exit.
Numerous studies have determined the effect of the reduced expression of mitotic
checkpoint genes, including Bub1, Bub1b, Bub3, Mad1, Mad2, Cenp-E, Cmt2, Mps1, ZW10,
ROD, and Zwilch, and found that the haploinsufficiency of these genes resulted in
chromosome mis-segregation (Table 1 and references within). Several key proteins,

including TOP2A, cooperate with APC/Ccdc20 and regulate sister chromosome segregation
(Figure 3).

ROLES OF TOP2A IN CIN
TOP2 is a group of highly conserved enzymes that catalyze the ATP-dependent transport of
one intact DNA double helix through another.51 As a result, the intertwined parental strands
of a replicating DNA ring can come apart, interlocked double-stranded DNA rings can
become unlinked, and knots can be introduced or removed from DNA rings.52 Previous
studies have revealed the important role of TOP2 activity in chromosome segregation
through the use of inhibitors. Drugs that interfere with TOP2 have been reported to induce
polyploidy and endoreduplication to different degrees, providing indirect evidence that this
enzyme is required for the separation of sister chromatids.53-58

Human somatic cells replicate and segregate their genomes with remarkable precision. In the
cell cycle, sister chromatids become entangled after DNA replication.59 Normally, the
decatenation checkpoint monitors the chromosome catenation status. Cells are arrested at the
G2 phase, and the onset of mitosis is delayed if sister chromatids are not fully separated.60-62
Because complete chromatid decatenation is required for accurate chromatid segregation, it
has been suggested that the attenuation of the decatenation checkpoint function contributes
to the acquisition of CIN in cancer cells.61 TOP2A possess three distinct subunit
dimerization interfaces (Figure 4A) and is maximally expressed in the G2 and M phases of
the cell cycle.63-66 It is specific for chromosome untangling and is essential for sister
chromosome segregation before anaphase.67-69 One biochemical study performed in
Xenopus egg extracts (XEEs) showed that centromeres were catenated while sister
chromatids underwent bipolar attachment and that TOP2A activity was required after the
onset of anaphase.69 As an alternative approach, TOP2 catalytic inhibitors have been used to
demonstrate the role of TOP2A in sister chromosome segregation. TOP2 catalytic inhibitors
determine the relative importance of the enzyme in promoting chromosome segregation at
the metaphase-anaphase transition. Inactivation of TOP2 by merbarone also resulted in
polyploidy in male mouse meiotic cells.70

Author Manuscript

TOP2 catalytic inhibitors inhibit the ATPase activity of TOP2A and stabilize this enzyme in
a closed-clamp form, rather than stabilizing the TOP2A DNA-cleavable complex, which is
the mechanism of action of TOP2 poisons (e.g. etoposide and teniposide).71 Therefore, in
contrast to TOP2 poisons, TOP2 inhibitors do not induce extensive DNA breaks. Among the
classes of catalytic TOP2 inhibitors, the bisdioxopiperazines (e.g., ICRF-154, ICRF-187,
and ICRF-193) have been the most extensively studied.72,73 Andoh et al reported that
ICRF-193, a catalytic, noncleavable-complex-forming-type TOP2 inhibitor, led to an
absence of chromosome segregation at mitosis, with further accumulation of polyploid
cells.74 In addition, treating human leukemia cells with ICRF-187 led to endoreduplication,
which resulted in large and highly polyploid cells.75 However, these TOP2 inhibitor studies
did not reveal whether a single isoform was responsible, and these phenotypes may have
been complicated by side effects of the inhibitors. Gene targeting in mice showed that
segregation was dependent on the alpha subunit of TOP2, not the beta subunit of TOP.76,77

metaphase, chromosomes failed to separate, and anaphase bridges formed,53,57,78,79
resulting in partial or complete chromosome gains or losses and polyploidy; this observation
supports the theory that the enzyme is important in anaphase segregation.80,81
As a whole, these reports support the theory that the catenation state of intertwined sister
chromosomes is monitored in G2 cells and that progression to mitosis is actively delayed
when chromosomes are not sufficiently decatenated. The final step, decatenation of
intertwined daughter molecules, can only be carried out by TOP2A.

TOP2A EXPRESSION REGULATION

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

TOP2A expression peaked in G2/M phase cells and decreased when cells completed mitosis.
Cell cycle-dependent TOP2A expression is essential, and TOP2A depletion in mammalian
culture cells causes severe defects in chromosome segregation during anaphase.82 The
expression level of human TOP2A is controlled by its promoter region. The TOP2A
promoter does not contain a consensus TATA motif but contains two GC boxes and five
CCAAT boxes that are located mostly in an inverted orientation (Figure 4B). The activity of
the TOP2A promoter is regulated by various external stimuli, including the stages of the cell
cycle, and by the TP53 tumor suppressor protein. Experimental studies using cell lines
showed that TOP2A expression was negatively regulated by wild-type TP53 through its
promoter region.83,84 In addition, Liu et al reported that TOP2A gene expression was
regulated by TP53 gene status and that several TP53 mutants exhibited reduced suppression
of TOP2A gene expression.85 This regulation was explained as a consequence of TP53
interfering with NF-Y binding to the regulatory sequences of the TOP2A promoter. NF-Y, a
ubiquitous transcription factor, recognizes and binds to inverted CCAAT boxes (ICBs). The
decrease in NF-Y activity is correlated with the decrease in TOP2A transcriptional activity,
transcript level, and expression.86 Furthermore, a chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis
showed that reduced recruitment of NF-Y to TOP2A gene regulatory regions decreased its
transcription.87,88

Author Manuscript

GC boxes are common elements in promoters. In the TOP2A promoter, GC1 and GC2 flank
ICB1 and ICB5, respectively. It has been reported that GC1 has a major role in the basal
transcription of TOP2A, while GC2 functions in a more modulatory capacity.89 Proteins
bound to the GC2 element may act as repressors. The specificity proteins Sp1 and Sp3 have
been implicated in the regulation of TOP2A transcription through binding to both GC1 and
GC2. Sp1 is commonly known as a transcriptional activator and is able to up-regulate
transcription in a variety of promoters, including TOP2A, while Sp3 is bifunctional. Sp3 is a
transcriptional repressor of TOP2A and a common modulator of Sp1-dependent
transcriptional activation.89 Since Sp3 is functionally dominant over Sp1, relatively small
increases in Sp3 levels or decreases in the Sp1/Sp3 ratio could result in reduced transcription
of TOP2A. However, Mo et al found that Sp3 was a transcriptional activator.90 It is possible
that this discrepancy is cell type specific.

POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS OF TOP2A
In mammalian cells, several different mechanisms regulate TOP2A's decatenation ability.
Posttranslational modification, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and small

ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOylation), can alter its protein activity, stability, or
localization (Figure 4C). The proteins involved in these modifications can regulate TOP2A's
decatenation of intertwined daughter chromosomes. Mutations or alterations of the genes
involving in TOP2A post-translational modification can lead to CIN and ultimately, cancer.
Phosphorylation

Author Manuscript

Phosphorylation is a key mechanism that regulates TOP2A's function. It has been proposed
to affect the catalytic activity of TOP2A.91 Most of the phosphorylation sites in TOP2A
protein are located within the C-terminal domain (Figure 4A).92-94 Some studies have
reported that these phosphorylation sites are not important for enzymatic activity but are
critical for the nuclear localization of TOP2A,95 because deletion of this region or mutation
of Ser-1376 or -1524 did not lead to inactivation of the enzyme.95,96 However, Chikamori et
al demonstrated that Ser-1106 was a major phosphorylation site in the catalytic domain of
TOP2A and that mutation of this Ser-1106 to alanine caused a decrease in enzymatic
activity.97 In addition, hypophosphorylation of Ser-1106 may be correlated with etoposide
resistance. These findings establish that Ser-1106 phosphorylation plays a critical role in
regulating TOP2A's decatenation function.

Author Manuscript

Several proteins are involved in the phosphorylation of TOP2A. Casein kinase IIβ, protein
kinase C, and extracellular signal-related kinase 2 have been shown to phosphorylate
TOP2A and enhance its activity.95,98,99 P38γ is a member of the p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinase family that can be activated by both stress and mitogenic signals. Qi et al
reported that p38γ phosphorylated the TOP2A Ser-1542 site and was important for TOP2A's
stability and activity.100 The polo-like kinase (Plk) family is also involved in the
phosphorylation of TOP2A. Plk1 phosphorylates Ser1337 and Ser1524 of TOP2A, while
Plk3 phosphorylates Thr1342.101,102 The maximum level of phosphorylation occurs in
mitosis, and Plk1- and Plk2-associated phosphorylation can activate TOP2A. Although
phosphorylation does not affect TOP2A's dynamic localization in chromosomes, it is
required for its essential role in sister chromosome segregation, and the observed
hyperphosphorylation could represent compensation for the reduced protein level.103
Ubiquitination

Author Manuscript

As a tumor suppressor, BRCA1 plays a versatile role through its ability to participate in
DNA damage response, checkpoint control, mitotic spindle assembly, centrosome
duplication, and sister chromosome segregation104. BRCA1 plays a critical role in the
maintenance of chromosome stability, which participates in TOP2A -dependent DNA
decatenation. Cells derived from conditional BRCA1-knockout mice have various
chromosome abnormalities.105,106
BRCA1 may regulate DNA decatenation through the ubiquitination of TOP2A. Lou et al
reported that, in the absence of BRCA1, there was only one-third as much decatenation
activity, and this contributed to a defect in chromosome segregation107 that was also
reported in BRCA1-defective embryonic mouse fibroblasts. BRCA1-deficient cells had
many spontaneous chromosome abnormalities.105,106,108 Shinagawa et al found that
BRCA1 is a regulator of TOP2A ubiquitination.109 Other studies have supported this

mechanism and demonstrated that BRCA1 has a RING finger domain with documented E3
ubiquitin ligase activity.107,110 BRCA1 can form a complex that includes BRCA1 and pRb
and then ubiquitinate TOP2A for its degradation. In this complex, pRb is another key factor
required for the degradation and inactivation of TOP2A on exposure to oxidative stress.
SUMOylation

Author Manuscript

SUMOs may be involved in diverse biological functions. The results of both genetic and
biochemical studies indicate that the SUMO modification pathway plays an important role
in proper cell cycle control, especially in the normal progression of mitosis. The results of
studies in XEEs have implicated SUMOylation in TOP2A's decatenation ability.111,112
TOP2A is modified by SUMO-2/3 on mitotic chromosomes in the early stages of mitosis
(Figure 4A).113 The inhibition of mitotic SUMOylation in the XEE assay system causes
aberrant sister chromosome separation in anaphase and alters TOP2A's association with
chromosomes.114 Similarly, PIASγ, a member of the PIAS family, is unique in its capacity
to bind mitotic chromosomes and is indispensable for accurate chromosome segregation in
XEEs. PIASγ with SUMO E3 ligase activity is a critical regulator of the mitotic SUMO-2
conjugation of TOP2A,115 and the activity of SUMO E3 ligase led to SUMO's modification
of TOP2A in mitosis.116 In human cells, PIASγ directs TOP2A to specific chromosome
regions that require efficient removal of DNA catenations prior to anaphase. A lack of
PIASγ leads to a prolonged metaphase block, in which normal metaphase plates form and
the spindle checkpoint is activated. Moreover, sister chromatids remain cohered, even if
cohesin is removed by depleting hSgo1, because DNA catenations persist at centromeres.117

Author Manuscript

Recently, it was reported that the nuclear pole protein RanBP2 bound to TOP2A and
regulated its SUMO modification, specifically in mitosis. RanBP2 catalyzed the
SUMOylation of TOP2A, directing this protein to inner centromeres for accurate
chromosome separation prior to anaphase onset. When RanBP2 was insufficient, this defect
led to chromatin bridges in anaphase, which were linked to impaired TOP2A-mediated
decatenation of sister chromatids.37 The results of these studies demonstrate that SUMO
modification leads TOP2A to accumulate at inner centromeres and is essential for proper
sister chromosome separation in mitosis.
Deacetylation

Author Manuscript

Histone acetylases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) modify nucleosomal
histones. Tsai et al reported that two histone deacetylation enzymes, HDAC1 and HDAC2,
were associated with TOP2 in vivo under normal physiological conditions.118 Their results
indicate that TOP2A and TOP2B are substrates for HDAC1 and HDAC2 and that complexes
containing HDAC1 or HDAC2 can increase TOP2 activity. HDAC1 and HDAC2 may
facilitate chromatin modification by targeting a subunit of TOP2 to chromatin regions that
are actively undergoing histone deacetylation. However, the mechanism by which TOP2 is
modified by deacetylation in vivo requires further investigation. Although the balance
between protein acetylation and deacetylation controls several physiological and
pathological cellular processes, the role of HATs in acetylation of TOP2A is yet-to-be
defined.

REGULATION OF TOP2A's DNA BINDING
Chromatin-Accessibility Complex
TOP2A is an ATP-dependent enzyme, and ATPase activity, which is important in TOP2A
catalyzed hydrolysis, is stimulated by free DNA. The chromatin-accessibility complex uses
energy to increase the general accessibility of DNA in chromatin. When its ATPase activity
is stimulated by nucleosomal DNA, it facilitates TOP2A's hydrolysis ability. The ATPase
subunit of the chromatin-accessibility complex, ISWI, and TOP2A are located in the same
complex. Nucleosome remodeling by ISWI may help TOP2A bind to chromatin, which will
enhanceTOP2A's hydrolysis.119
SWI/SNF Complex

Author Manuscript

A similar mechanism is found in another ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex,
SWI/SNF. The mammalian SWI/SNF complex is composed of two distinct groups, the Brm/
Brg1-associated factor (BAF) and polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF) complexes. The BAF
complex is composed of one of two mutually exclusive catalytic ATPase subunits, BRG1 or
BRM, whereas the PBAF complex uses only BRG1 as the catalytic subunit. The deletion of
BRG1 or the expression of the tumor-associated G1232D mutant BRG1 reduced TOP2A's
decatenation ability and caused anaphase bridges.39 The loss of another subunit of the BAF
complex, BAF250a, also resulted in TOP2A decatenation defects. In the BAF complex,
TOP2A associated with BRG1 through a direct interaction with BAF250a. Moreover,
TOP2A binding to DNA was dependent on BAF's function. The BRG1 mutants reduced the
association between TOP2A and chromatin. Consequently, reduced binding of TOP2A to
chromatin reduced TOP2A's function and weakened its ability to associate with substrate
DNA during decatenation.

DNA Damage Checkpoint 1 Complex

Author Manuscript

A number of gene products are involved in TOP2A's decatenation function (Table 2).
Mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) is an important multi-functional
checkpoint protein that can interact with TOP2A.96 Luo et al found within the 71 amino
acids of the TOP2A C-terminal region (residues 1461-1531), Ser 1524 was required for
MDC1 binding to TOP2A (Figure 4A); mutation of the Ser 1524 site abolished this
interaction. In addition, phosphorylation of Ser 1524 occurred preferentially when cells were
in G2/M transition.96 These findings indicate that MDC1-TOP2A interaction and TOP2A
Ser 1524 phosphorylation of are involved in the decatenation checkpoint. Luo et al further
demonstrated that when phosphorylated, Ser 1524 of TOP2A acted as a binding site for
MDC1 and the following MDC1-TOP2A interaction recruited this complex to chromatin.
Although the MDC1-TOP2A interaction is not required for checkpoint activation induced by
DNA damage, it is required for activation of the decatenation checkpoint. Mutation of Ser
1524 results in a defective decatenation checkpoint. These results reveal an important role of
MDC1-TOP2A interaction in checkpoint activation and the maintenance of chromosome
stability.

ALTERATIONS OF TOP2A AND RELATED GENES IN CANCERS TOP2A

Author Manuscript

TOP2A is considered a specific marker for cell proliferation, and it plays an important role
in malignant tumors. As indicated by the findings discussed above, several interacting
partners of TOP2A and mitotic checkpoint proteins regulate accurate chromosome
segregation. The abnormal alteration of TOP2A and related genes consistently contributes to
the human cancer genome (Table 3). The expression, genetic alteration, and enzyme activity
of TOP2A have been studied in several types of malignancies.120-125 In primary invasive
ovarian carcinoma, both protein and mRNA levels of TOP2A expression were increased in
high-grade and advanced-stage tumors; there was also a correlation between high expression
and poor survival.121 In Depowski et al's study, TOP2A was a candidate marker of
increased cell proliferation and poor prognosis in breast cancer.122 These authors also
reported that it was preferentially expressed in a more aggressive subset of breast tumors
(HER-2/neu overexpressed), and HER-2/neu was overexpressed in tumors with increased
TOP2A expression. Since TOP2A is located close to HER-2/neu on chromosome 17, the
levels of TOP2A gene copy number were assessed in samples with HER-2/neu
amplification. Bhargava et al’ reported that TOP2A amplification was found in 39% (25/64)
of HER-2-amplified tumors and was not detected in the absence of HER-2 amplification in
their study.154 TOP2A deletion was also seen in 7 (11%) of 64 tumors. However, whether
TOP2A amplification leads to higher TOP2A protein levels is controversial. Mueller et al
reported that TOP2A gene amplification in breast tumors was not predictive of high TOP2A
protein expression.123

Author Manuscript

In addition to human breast and ovarian cancer, elevated expression of TOP2A has been
identified in oral cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, esophageal cancer, lung cancer,
gallbladder carcinoma, hepatocellular cancer, and colorectal cancer.125 TOP2A
overexpression in these cancers is associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype, advanced
disease stage, tumor recurrence, and decreased overall survival.
BRCA1

Author Manuscript

As one of the representative interacting partners of TOP2A, BRCA1 is located on
chromosome 17q21.31 and encodes a critical tumor suppressor. Low expression of BRCA1
was previously shown to increase the growth rate of benign and malignant breast tissue.141
In another study, loss of nuclear BRCA1 expression was significantly associated with high
histological grade.142 Interestingly, low BRCA1 expression is associated with the
development of distant metastasis and a poor prognosis in sporadic breast cancer.143
Dorairaj et al reported that the rs8176318 G > T 3’UTR variant of BRCA1 is associated with
decreased BRCA1 expression, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, they showed that this
variant was predictive of aggressive and stage IV disease.144
Importantly, BRCA1 mutations account for the majority of hereditary breast and ovarian
cancers. Compared to BRCA2-mutation carriers, BRCA1-mutation carriers have a higher risk
of developing both breast and ovarian cancer. The risk of breast cancer in individuals with
the BRCA1 mutation range from 50% to 80%.145 Meanwhile, over 10% of human ovarian
cancers contain BRCA1 mutations in the coding region, which result in genetic instability.103

Author Manuscript

In addition to human breast and ovarian cancer, BRCA1 mutation carriers were found to
have an increased risk of pancreatic cancer and prostate carcinoma.140
BRG1
BRG1 is a critical interacting partner of TOP2A and is mutated in various malignancies,
including prostate, lung, breast, colon, pancreas, ovary, and colon carcinomas. Allelotype
analyses have often shown loss of heterozygosity at the 19p13 region, where Brg1 is
localized. In addition, a number of anti-cancer proteins, such as BRCA1, p53, and Rb, have
been functionally linked to BRG1, further suggesting that Brg1 loss can hasten cancer
development. The results of these studies suggest that BRG1 has a tumor-suppressive role in
a wide range of human cancers.146

Author Manuscript

Medina et al reported a high incidence of inactivating mutations of Brg1 in lung cancer cell
lines.147 BRG1 was inactive in a quarter of the 59 lines. Such alterations were more
common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Thirty-five percent of the
NSCLC cell lines carried Brg1-inactivating mutations, compared with only approximately
5% of SCLC cell lines. An earlier study performed an immunohistochemical analysis to
evaluate the levels of BRG1 in primary NSCLCs and found that 30% of tumors had no
detectable protein, suggesting BRG1 inactivation.148 Furthermore, loss of nuclear
expression of Brg1 was associated with a low survival rate in NSCLC patients. Glaros et al
found that heterozygous loss of Brg1 could serve as an initiating event in lung cancer
development, whereas complete loss of Brg1 could promote tumor progression rather than
tumor initiation.149

Author Manuscript

In pancreatic tumors, Brg1 also acts as a tumor suppressor. Mutations in Brg1 and other
members of the SWI/SNF complex were observed in over 30% of human pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma cases.150 Furthermore, decreased Brg1 expression was associated with the
IPMN precursor lesion that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is thought to arise from.151 As
in lung cancer, Brg1-inactivating mutations and deletions were found in pancreatic cancer
cell lines. Taken as together, loss of BRG1 affects cancer development.

THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF TOP2A IN PERSONALIZED CANCER THERAPY

Author Manuscript

The homeostasis and balance of the topoisomerase network are critical. Too much or too
few of the key enzymes will lead to topological stress on the chromosomes and cell death.
Thus, TOP2 and TOP1 are often highly expressed to cope with stress. This may lead to a
“topoisomerase addiction” phenotype in CIN. Targeting this addiction may kill these
cells.155 In addition, the level of TOP2A increases 2-3-fold during G2/M phase,156 and the
expression level is much higher in rapidly proliferating cells than in quiescent cell
populations.157 Targeting both TOP2A-mediated DNA cleavage and cell proliferation has
been an attractive approach in cancer therapy. Another isoform of TOP2, TOP2B, does not
change significantly during the cell cycle. It has been suggested that targeting TOP2B leads
to several undesirable consequences, with little clear benefit.158

TOP2-targeting Agents in Clinic

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Several TOP2 inhibitors/poisons have been approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration, including etoposide, teniposide, doxorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin, and
mitoxantrone (Figure 5). Both etoposide and teniposide damage DNA by interacting with
TOP2 to form cleavable complexes that prevent the relegation of DNA; this leads to doublestrand DNA breaks. Etoposide is used to treat a wide variety of malignancies, including
SCLC, testicular cancer, neuroblastoma, leukemias, and lymphomas, while teniposide is
used in pediatric patients with poor-prognosis acute lymphocytic leukemia.157 Like
etoposide and teniposide, anthracyclines intercalate into DNA and are commonly used to
treat breast cancer, leukemias, lymphomas, and sarcomas. The anthracyclines that are
currently approved for use in the United States are doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin,
and idarubicin. Doxorubicin is the most commonly used anthracycline for the treatment of
solid tumors. Mitoxantrone is an anthracenedione that targets TOP2 and is the only agent of
its class approved for clinical use. In the past, these drugs were used without considering
whether the cancer had a G2/M checkpoint defect and CIN. Now, an important goal of
clinical research is to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of TOP2-targeting drugs while
minimizing the risk of toxicity. Thus, it is critical to better understand the role of TOP2A
and the genes that regulate TOP2A in personalized chemotherapy.
Potential Roles of TOP2A in Personalized Cancer Therapy

Author Manuscript

The TOP2A level is believed to be a major determinant of cellular sensitivity to targeting
this enzyme. Thus, genetic and molecular defects that lead to increased TOP2A levels may
serve as predictors of a better response to TOP2A inhibitors/poisons. Because TP53
deficiency is one of the most common genetic aberrations in human cancers and TP53
negatively regulates TOP2A expression, cancer cells with the TP53 mutation have elevated
TOP2A levels and are more sensitive to TOP2A inhibitors/poisons.85 Similarly, it has been
shown that the level of TOP2A partly depends on the ratio of Sp1:Sp3 in the cells, which
also affects the sensitivity of cancer cells to TOP2A inhibitors.89 Wang et al reported that
alterations in NF-Y, a ubiquitous transcription factor that interacts with the TOP2A
promoter, had a significant effect on TOP2A expression and has important consequences in
TOP2A-targeting agents.86 Identifying the key factors that regulate TOP2A will help us
develop an accurate model for predicting patients’ response to TOP2A-targeted
chemotherapy.

Author Manuscript

Because TOP2A is an enzyme, its activity may more closely determine cellular sensitivity to
TOP2A-directed chemotherapy. Cancer cells with a defect in TOP2A decatenation activity,
which is caused by TOP2A modifications or other factors, are resistant to topoisomerase
inhibitors/poisons. Since phosphorylation of TOP2A regulates its decatenation activity,
researchers have studied the role of altered TOP2A phosphorylation in drug sensitivity.
Chikamori et al found that cancer cells with the TOP2A S1106A site mutation were resistant
to etoposide and amsacrine,97 demonstrating that site-specific phosphorylation regulates
sensitivity to TOP2-targeting drugs. Thus, hypophosphorylation of TOP2A may be
responsible for patients’ lack of response to treatment. Chen et al reported that
hypophosphorylation of TOP2A in teniposide-resistant cells was two times higher than in
parental cells.159 A subsequent study by Ritke et al in etoposide-resistant K562 human

leukemia cells revealed that hypophosphorylation of TOP2A in these cells was due to
decreased levels of Casein kinase IIβ.160 In addition, as it is a kinase, ERK2 has been shown
to phosphorylate TOP2A and enhance its activity.99 Kolb et al reported that inhibition of
ERK1 and ERK2 activation using specific inhibitors markedly attenuated the G2/M arrest
induced by etoposide.161 Similarly, p38γ, which is important to TOP2A's stability and
activity, actively regulates the drug-TOP2A signal transduction; this can be exploited to
increase the therapeutic activity of TOP2 drugs. In addition to phosphorylation, other
posttranslational modifications of TOP2A, including ubiquitination, can regulate the
decatenation and localization of this enzyme. Unlike phosphorylation, which can enhance
TOP2A activity, BRCA1 ubiquitination reduces TOP2A activity.102 The absence of
functional BRCA1 enhances cellular sensitivity to etoposide.162

Author Manuscript

A major challenge to the clinical use of TOP2 inhibitors/poisons is that they are associated
with the development of secondary cancers. Etoposide is widely used for the treatment of
many cancer types; however, it is associated with an increased risk of secondary leukemia,
particularly acute myelogenous leukemia. TOP2 inhibitors/poisons, including etoposide,
often cause rearrangements that involve the mixed lineage leukemia gene on chromosome
11q23, which is associated with this secondary cancer. The risk of secondary acute
myelogenous leukemia appears to be dependent on the drug dose. Pedersen-Bjergaard
reported that the risk of developing secondary leukemia was 336 times higher with etoposide
doses of > 2.0 g/m2 than with doses of ≤ 2.0 g/m2.163 On the basis of these data, CIN status
may be an important factor that should be considered when the dose of TOP2 inhibitors/
poisons are chosen because cancer cells with different TOP2A decatenation activity levels
have different sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors and low-dose regimens induce a lower
risk of leukemogenesis.

Author Manuscript

Another challenge in clinically using TOP2-targeting agents is drug resistance. In resistant
cells, TOP2A alterations have been found at both expression level and catalytic activity of
the enzyme. Point mutations in the TOP2A gene have also been found in resistant cells.
Cancer cells with the TOP2A decatenation defect are resistant to TOP2 inhibitors, indicating
that cancer cells’ sensitivity to these drugs can be affected by genes that are involved in
TOP2A-mediated CIN. Mutations or alterations in these genes may result in different
prognoses after treatment with topoisomerase inhibitors. Thus, further studies of TOP2 drug
sensitivity and CIN genes may open a new avenue for the development of personalized
cancer therapy.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Author Manuscript

A comprehensive characterization of cancer genome landscapes unequivocally established
that genomic instability is a hallmark of tumorigenesis. Genomic instability manifests in two
major genotypes: genetic mutations and CIN. Genetic mutations are believed to be initiated
by mutations of a group of DNA repair genes. However, the initiating events for CIN are
still elusive. The picture is further muddied because chromosomal copy number alterations
are also observed in normal cells; thus, the initiating events for CIN may regularly occur in
subclones of normal cells, but only a small percentage evolve into neoplasms.164 Therefore,
although CIN is fully manifested as a tumor phenomenon, it is unlikely to be tumor specific.

Rather, it is mostly likely a pre-cancer phenotype that is intimately tied to cell division, a
highly regulated and fundamental process with multiple checkpoints to monitor for errors
and remove strayed cells. In particular to the CIN phenotype, correct chromosome
segregation requires extensive choreography with key “conductors,” such as TOP2A to cut
and paste, spin, and package. The more cell divisions that occur, the higher the chance of
errors and the higher the chances of cells surviving the monitoring system and becoming
neoplastic. Cancer cells either have CIN or the high mutation phenotype, illustrating that not
only do these two genetic aberrations have distinct mechanisms but also that they have an
equilibrium and “stability” that is likely supported by a new set of machinery. In other
words, these CIN cells are “addicted” to something, which if characterized, would qualify as
the Achilles heel.

Author Manuscript

The results of our literature review and analysis support the hypothesis that TOP2A is an
Achilles heel in cancer therapy. However, the reported responses to TOP2 inhibitors/poisons
have been limited. This is not surprising given that not all cancer cells are “addicted” to
TOP2. TOP2's activities are subject to multiple levels of regulation—copy number, gene
expression control, post-translational modifications, partner protein interactions, and
feedback loops—that lead to other changes in checkpoint control, such as the compensatory
regulation of TOP1. Therefore, to fully explore TOP2 as an effective target for therapy,
more in-depth investigations of the TOP2 regulatory network are needed. Careful
interrogation of the clinical annotations that are tied to genomic characterization will help us
identify prognostic factors that can be used to stratify patients by responsive or resistant
disease; only those with responsive would receive TOP2 inhibitors/poisons.

Figure 1. Cancer biology of CIN

Normally, a 4N cell in G2 enters mitosis, aligns its chromosomes in the metaphase plate,
and equally distributes the DNA over two nuclei and subsequently, two daughter cells.30
The decatenation checkpoint controls sister chromosome segregation and delays entry into
mitosis until the knotted chromosomes have been decatenated by TOP2A. When the
decatenation checkpoint is defective, chromosomal mis-segregation is observed. This causes
aneuploidy and CIN. CIN can provide these evolving cell subclones with a mechanism that
fosters unremitting genomic and mutational plasticity; this leads to increased cell survival,
increased cell proliferation, and carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the decatenation checkpoint
deficiency can result in additional chromosome imbalances of cancer cells, increasing tumor
malignancy. CIN can slow the proliferation rate and cause cell death in cells with
chromosomal alternations but no unremitting genomic and mutational plasticity.

Figure 3. Regulation of sister chromatid separation

Author Manuscript

In pro-metaphase, various mitotic checkpoint proteins, including Mps1, Rae1, Bub1, Bub3,
BubR1, Mad1, and Mad2, bind kinetochores that lack attachment or tension. Unattached
chromosomes apparently generate a signal that delays progress to anaphase until all sister
chromatids are attached to the spindle apparatus. This signal is transduced by the spindlecheckpoint complex that includes CENPE and the Mad/Bub proteins, resulting in inhibition
of APC/CCdc20. After attachment of the last kinetochore to the mitotic spindle, the “wait
anaphase” signal is extinguished. This allows APC/CCdc20 to become active, resulting in the
ubiquitin-dependent degradation of cohesion. The separase is then activated, and the
protease catalyzes the cleavage of cohesion complexes that contain Rec8, which bridges the
aligned sister chromatids. The kinase Plk1 marks Rec8 at chromatid arms by
phosphorylation so that Rec8 will be degraded by separase, while a complex of Sgo1 is
recruited by Bub1 to centromeres. Sgo1 can bind and protect Rec8 from phosphorylation by
Plk1. Sister chromatid separation is also dependent on TOP2A, which targets inner
centromeres and decatenates centromeric DNA. The newly separated chromatids can then
migrate poleward along the spindle axis during anaphase. Once the chromosomes become
bi-oriented, Sgo1 is dephosphorylated at Thr-346 and Sgo1 no longer binds to cohesion.
NMSP715, NMS-P937, BI6727, BI2536, UA62784, etoposide, and teniposide target the
mitotic checkpoint for cancer therapy.

Figure 4. Regulation of TOP2A

Author Manuscript

A) Domain arrangement of TOP2A. TOP2A possesses 3 distinct subunit dimerization
interfaces, termed the N-gate, DNA-gate, and C-gate. Functional regions and postmodification sites are colored and labeled. GHKL, GHKL (gyrase, Hsp90, histidine kinase,
MutL) family ATPase; TOPRIM, Mg2+ ion-binding Topoisomerase/Primase fold; WHD,
winged helix domain; CTR, C-terminal domain. B) Transcriptional regulation of TOP2A
expression. The expression of human TOP2A is controlled by its promoter region that
contains two GC boxes and five CCAAT boxes. NF-Y recognizes and binds to the ICBs.
This binding of NF-Y to the TOP2A promoter can be promoted by HMGB1/2 and inhibited
by pRb. In the TOP2A promoter, GC1 and GC2 flank ICB1 and ICB5, respectively. Two
specificity proteins, Sp1 and Sp3, regulate TOP2A transcription by binding to both GC1 and
GC2. Sp1 is a transcriptional activator and can up-regulate TOP2A transcription, while Sp3
is a transcriptional repressor of TOP2A and a common modulator of Sp1-dependent
transcriptional activation. C) Post-translational modifications of TOP2A. TOP2A is
activated by phosphorylation and enhanced by HDAC1 and HDAC2, but it is inhibited by
the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of BRCA1. SUMO modification, which is catalyzed by
RanBP2, leads TOP2A to accumulate at inner centromeres and is essential for proper sister
chromosome separation in mitosis. P, phosphorylation; S, SUMOylation; T, TOP2A.
