BACKGROUND: Hospital services are expectantly reduced over the weekend, which may result in a delay in treatment
or in obtainment of medical procedures. The authors investigated quality of care and clinical outcomes of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who were hospitalized on weekends versus weekdays and treated with
induction chemotherapy. METHODS: This retrospective follow-up study involved 422 AML patients treated with
cytarabine-based induction chemotherapy at Cleveland Clinic from 1994-2008. Quality outcome measures included
time to triple-lumen catheter (TLC) placement, time to induction chemotherapy, length of stay (LOS), early death
(within 15 days of chemotherapy), and 30-day mortality. These were tested for the association with known predictors
of AML survival and etiology by the methods of linear, categorical, and survival analyses. RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of all admissions (n ¼ 422) occurred over the weekend (n ¼ 103). Compared with younger (aged <60 years)
patients, older patients had higher 30-day mortality (P ¼ .003), early death (P ¼ .025), and time to induction rates (P
¼ .02), but lower complete remission (P ¼ .001) and overall survival (OS) rates (P < .0001). In univariate analyses,
time to TLC was delayed for weekend admissions (P < .01). Weekend admissions had lower early mortality (P ¼ .04)
and 30-day mortality (P ¼ .02). In multivariate analysis, only time to TLC remained significantly longer for weekend
admissions (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Weekend admissions significantly delayed placement of TLC without affecting
other quality parameters or patient survival. This is likely because of immediate initiation of peripheral chemotherapy

Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with ruptured aortic aneurysm, pulmonary embolism,1 acute myo-

cardial infarction,2,3 and cardiac arrest1,4-7 admitted to North American hospitals over the weekend had higher in-hospital
mortality compared with those admitted on weekdays. Higher mortality was also detected in patients with leukemia hospitalized over the weekend.1 Weekend staffing shortages and reduced availability of some diagnostic procedures and therapeutic services were proposed to explain the poorer outcomes.1
In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most common leukemia in adults,8 immediate initiation of intensive induction chemotherapy is generally considered requisite for maximizing survival, particularly in younger
patients.9-13 Younger patients aged <60 years have complete remission (CR) rates that approach 85% and long-term disease-free survival (DFS) rates of up to 40%.14,15 For patients aged 60 years and older, CR rates drop to 50%, and longterm DFS rates decrease to 5% to 10%. Before starting chemotherapy, certain procedures must be performed, such as
placement of a central catheter. These may be delayed or unavailable on weekends, thus potentially postponing induction
chemotherapy, increasing length of stay (LOS), and perhaps impacting CR rates or overall survival (OS).16 AML thus
serves as a model for nonsurgical medical emergencies.

Weekend Admissions, Quality of Care, and AML Outcomes/Bejanyan et al

We hypothesized that the quality of care and clinical
outcomes of patients with newly diagnosed AML admitted for remission induction chemotherapy over the weekend differed from patients admitted on weekdays.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Setting
AML patients admitted to the Cleveland Clinic Leukemia
Service from 1994 to 2008 for remission induction chemotherapy were included in this study. The diagnosis of
AML was independently confirmed at Cleveland Clinic
and classified according to the French-American-British
(FAB) system until 2001 or the World Health Organization (WHO) system for myeloid neoplasms thereafter.17,18 Cytogenetics were determined by using
metaphase karyotyping, based on analyses of 20 or more
cells. Cytogenetic risk classification categories were
defined according to Cancer and Leukemia Group B
(CALGB) 8461.19 Patients with established central lines
and/or induction chemotherapy already initiated before
arrival at Cleveland Clinic were excluded from analyses.
Data for established prognostic factors for AML outcome
were collected. These included patient age, race, sex, white
blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis, cytogenetic risk
groups, and AML etiology (de novo vs secondary AML,
including therapy-related AML and AML arising from an
antecedent hematologic disorder).
The treatment regimens contained conventionaldose cytarabine (100-200 mg/m2 continuous infusion
daily times 7 days) in combination with 3 days of an
anthracycline, anthracenedione, or etoposide, administered through a triple-lumen catheter (TLC). Patients
were typically hospitalized until their absolute neutrophil
count (ANC) reached 500 cells/lL, barring complications
of protracted fevers or bleeding complications. This study
was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional
Review Board.
Definitions for Quality of Care
Quality measures were defined as: (1) time to TLC placement, defined by the number of days from admission to
central-access placement; (2) time to induction chemotherapy, measured from the date of admission to initiation
of induction chemotherapy; (3) LOS in the hospital, the
number of days of hospitalization during initial remission
induction chemotherapy; (4) early death, defined as a
death within 15 days of chemotherapy initiation determined by International Working Group (IWG)20; (5) 30-

day mortality; and (6) CR rates and OS. These definitions
were derived from focus groups with leukemia experts and
from measurable, internationally accepted AML outcome
variables.20
Weekend admissions were those from Friday, 5 PM
through Monday, 12 AM, as these are typically the hours
during which hospital staffing and the ability to obtain
relevant procedures are compromised. CR was defined by
using IWG criteria. OS was calculated from the date of diagnosis to last physician contact and from searches of US
Social Security Administration death records (http//:govdeathrecords.com). DFS was calculated from the date of
CR to date of relapse.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical routines in SAS v9.13 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC) were applied to the descriptive analyses of both continuous and categorical data. Patient characteristics and
CR were summarized by using frequency counts and descriptive statistics, which included the mean  standard
deviation, median, and range. Factors associated with
quality of care were analyzed by chi-square or Student t
test in univariate, and by logistic or linear regression in
multivariate analyses. All significant univariate factors
were included in multivariate analyses. A stepwise-selection algorithm that used a 2-tailed P ¼ .05 cutoff for
determining inclusion and removal of factors from models was used to identify independent predictors of each
outcome. Survival outcomes were analyzed by KaplanMeier and Cox proportional hazard methods in SAS.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
We identified 422 patients with a new diagnosis of AML
who were treated with cytarabine-based induction chemotherapy at Cleveland Clinic from 1994-2008. The date of
hospital admission could be successfully identified for
406 patients (96%, 303 patients admitted on weekdays
and 103 patients admitted over weekends). Baseline characteristics appear in Table 1. Median patient age was 61
years (range, 17-81), with patients aged 60 years
accounting for 51% of the overall population. Approximately two-thirds (65%) of patients had primary AML at
diagnosis. The cytogenetic risk distribution reflected this
mixture of older and younger patients and of primary and
secondary disease: 49 (12%) patients had favorablerisk cytogenetics, 174 (41%) had intermediate-risk

Quality Measures—Entire Population
In-hospital mortality among the 422 patients hospitalized
for remission induction chemotherapy was 11.4%. Thirteen (3.1%) patients died within the first 15 days of
induction chemotherapy and 48 (10.4%) patients within
30 days of hospitalization. A CR was achieved by 281
(66.6%) patients. For the entire group, the median OS
was 0.72 years, and 2-year OS was 18.4%. Having acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL) did not impact the effect
of weekend admission on outcome.

3616

Median time to TLC placement was 2 days (range,
0-27 days), corresponding to the median time to initiation of any component of induction chemotherapy of
2 days (range, 0-22 days). The median length of hospital
stay for the entire population was 32 days (range, 4-91
days).
Quality Measures—Older and Younger Adults
In stratified analyses, older patients (aged 60 years),
compared with younger patients (aged <60 years), had
significantly higher in-hospital mortality (16.2% vs 6.9%,
respectively; P ¼ .004), 30-day mortality (14.7% vs
5.8%, respectively; P ¼ .003), and mortality within 15
days of chemotherapy (4.9% vs.1.1%, respectively; P ¼
.025; Table 2). Younger patients were more likely than
older patients to achieve a CR (77.8% vs 68.9%, respectively; P ¼ .001) and had longer median survival (1.30
years vs 0.53 years, respectively; P < .001), DFS (P < .01;
Fig. 2), and 2-year survival (33% vs 8%, respectively; P <
.001). Although timing of TLC placement and LOS did
not differ between younger and older patients, there was a

slight delay in initiating remission induction therapy for
older patients (2.7 vs 2.1 days, P ¼ .02).
Quality Measures—Weekday Versus Weekend
Admissions
In univariate analyses, patients admitted for remission
induction therapy over weekends experienced an average
delay of 1 day in TLC placement compared with patients
admitted on weekdays (3.8 vs 2.7 days, respectively; P ¼
.002; Table 3). Patients admitted on weekends trended toward a longer overall hospital LOS (35.9 vs 33.5 days,
respectively; P ¼ .09). Weekend admissions were associated with lower early mortality rates (0% vs 4% for weekday admission, P ¼ .04) and 30-day mortality rates (3.9%
vs 12.3% for weekday admissions, P ¼ .02). No difference was found between weekend and weekday admissions for time to induction (2.5 vs 2.4 days, respectively;
P ¼ .6), CR rates (72% vs 69%, respectively; P ¼ .6), OS
(258 vs 273 days, respectively; P ¼ .2; Fig. 3), or DFS
rates (P ¼ .34; Fig. 4) both for the entire population or after adjustment for multiple covariates (Table 4).

In multivariate analyses comparing weekday to
weekend admissions, the only single significant finding
remained a longer time to TLC placement for weekend
compared with weekday admissions (P ¼ .001; Table 4).
No difference was detected for in-hospital mortality, LOS
in hospital, CR rates, OS, or DFS.

DISCUSSION
Similar to other medical emergencies, patients admitted
to the hospital with AML require prompt specialist intervention and initiation of procedures and chemotherapy.
Thus, AML is an ideal model to study quality of care, particularly as it relates to the effect of weekend admissions
for a nonsurgical disease. This is the first study, to our
knowledge, to define and measure this aspect of quality of
care in AML.

The AML population described herein is typical of
other large databases across the United States in baseline
characteristics and in age-specific outcome. We observed
a significant delay of approximately 1 day of central-line
placement in AML patients hospitalized on weekends
when compared with those admitted on weekdays. There
was also a trend toward a longer hospital stay in patients
admitted on weekends in univariate analyses. Interestingly, this delay in central-line placement did not affect
overall time to initiation of chemotherapy, in-hospital
mortality, OS, or DFS. Reasons for lower mortality in
patients admitted on weekends are unclear and not
explained by prognostic factors, which were controlled in
multivariate analyses. It is possible that referral patterns
played a role, although this is difficult to measure. In
another study, we identified the median delay between
AML diagnosis at an outside facility and admission to
Cleveland Clinic to be 3 days (range, 1-99 days) for those
patients diagnosed before admission, and there was no
impact on outcome.11 There was a trend toward delay in
chemotherapy initiation in older adults. Although delay
was statistically significant, it did not appear to be clinically relevant. Other factors that could contribute to this
delay include treatment of active infections, assessment of
comorbid conditions, and optimization of performance
status. We believe that immediate initiation of cytarabine
chemotherapy via peripheral venous access, when central
access was not readily available for anthracycline administration, could partly account for the timely initiation of
chemotherapy. In addition, physician and nurse leukemia

3618

specialists were available to formulate treatment plans and
initiate chemotherapy over the weekend, and patients
were able to receive intravenous antibiotics and blood
products, likely minimizing the life-threatening complications that commonly result in early mortality in this
population.21,22
Numerous studies of other serious medical conditions have demonstrated poorer clinical outcomes for
patients admitted over weekends, particularly if relevant
diagnostic tests, procedures, and therapeutic interventions
were less available during weekend admissions.1-4,23-25
Cram and colleagues demonstrated an increased mortality
rate in patients admitted during the weekend from the
emergency department with 50 common medical conditions, with somewhat higher mortality rates seen in major
teaching hospitals compared with nonteaching settings
(OR, 1.13 vs 1.03, respectively; P ¼ .03).24 Investigators
from the Mayo Clinic, however, found no difference in
mortality between weekend and weekdays admissions in a
single, large, tertiary, medical center intensive-care unit.26
Increased overall mortality rates among leukemia patients
were reported in 2 previous studies.1,24 Bell and colleagues
included, among all acute-care admissions from emergency departments in Ontario, Canada, over a 10-year period of time, 779 patients with leukemia (unspecified type
and acuity) and showed higher mortality rates in patients
admitted over weekends (OR, 1.60).1 Neither the Mayo
Clinic nor the Bell et al study focused on AML, but the
differences in outcome hint at a possible effect of a specialized center in minimizing deleterious outcomes over the
weekend for serious medical conditions. Our results,
derived from a tertiary academic center where hospital
personnel, including leukemia specialists and hematopathologists, and some interventional radiology services are
available over the weekend and recognize the emergent
nature of AML, support this claim.
The data from this study cannot be readily generalized to every medical institution. The ‘‘lazy Sunday’’
phenomena may be more significant within small, nonacademic institutions with more pronounced differences in
the level of medical care delivered on weekdays as opposed
to weekends, including the ability even to diagnose AML.
A next step would be to compare these findings to those
from nonspecialized centers to see whether they differ and
to determine whether a measure of quality should be referral to a leukemia specialty center.
The retrospective design of our study is among the
potential limitations, which almost always introduce the
potential for ascertainment and misclassification biases. As

quality of care has not previously been defined for AML,
identifying measurable factors was a necessary first step and
had to be done retrospectively. The Cleveland Clinic
leukemia database has been operational and collecting data
since 2002. The use of these data in our study should minimize the potential for bias, as the data are quality-checked
without knowledge of study hypotheses. If present, the errors
in documenting, eg, timing of admission, can become a
source of bias, although it would be unlikely for this type of
bias to affect the major study groups in a differential manner.
Another limitation of our study is that we did treat major
holidays as weekdays; in general, these days are not any
different from the weekends in terms of shortage of the
staffing and delay in procedures, but they were difficult to
identify on an individual patient basis. The effect of classifying them as such should be minimal, as they account for
only 5 days yearly at the Cleveland Clinic. Finally, the
patient’s eligibility for initiation of induction chemotherapy
on the basis of age and underlying comorbidities were determined by individual leukemia-service staff. Although this
raises the potential for selection bias in terms of severity
of the underlying clinical conditions of our study population, it represents real-world determinations of induction
chemotherapy eligibility, which is supported by national
cancer groups.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that AML
patients admitted to a large, teaching, referral hospital
over the weekend have similar clinical outcomes compared with patients admitted on weekdays, despite delays
in procedures and possibly longer hospital stays and, for
older adults, in initiating chemotherapy. Thus, quality of
care for AML is measurable and quantifiable. Our data
hint at the importance of referral patterns for AML
patients from smaller hospitals to tertiary centers over the
weekend once induction chemotherapy is indicated, and
that initiation of induction chemotherapy at a leukemia
specialty center may negate the ‘‘lazy weekend’’ effect seen
for other serious medical conditions. Future comparison
of outcomes between a referral center and community setting may identify the need for treating patients with AML
in specialized centers.
The results from this study also reinforce the strategy
of initiating the cytarabine therapy peripherally while
awaiting central-line placement. Finally, our study
emphasizes the importance of defining and addressing the
quality outcome measures in patients with AML, the need
to institute programs to maximize quality of care through
ensuring weekend services, and to measure the impact of
such programs.
