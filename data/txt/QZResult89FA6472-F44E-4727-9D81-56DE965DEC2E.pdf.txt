ABSTRACT
Advances in the molecular biology of medulloblastoma revealed four genetically
and clinically distinct subgroups. Group 3 medulloblastomas are characterized by
frequent amplifications of the oncogene MYC, a high incidence of metastasis, and poor
prognosis despite aggressive therapy. We investigated several potential small molecule
inhibitors to target Group 3 medulloblastomas based on gene expression data using an
in silico drug screen. The Connectivity Map (C-MAP) analysis identified piperlongumine
as the top candidate drug for non-WNT medulloblastomas and the cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK) inhibitor alsterpaullone as the compound predicted to have specific
antitumor activity against Group 3 medulloblastomas. To validate our findings we
used these inhibitors against established Group 3 medulloblastoma cell lines. The
C-MAP predicted drugs reduced cell proliferation in vitro and increased survival in
Group 3 medulloblastoma xenografts. Alsterpaullone had the highest efficacy in
Group 3 medulloblastoma cells. Genomic profiling of Group 3 medulloblastoma cells
treated with alsterpaullone confirmed inhibition of cell cycle-related genes, and downregulation of MYC. Our results demonstrate the preclinical efficacy of using a targeted
therapy approach for Group 3 medulloblastomas. Specifically, we provide rationale
for advancing alsterpaullone as a targeted therapy in Group 3 medulloblastoma.

INTRODUCTION

pathway activation have the most favorable prognosis
whereas Group 3 medulloblastomas have the worst
outcome [3, 4]. Group 3 tumors are restricted to pediatric
patients, characterized by amplification of MYC, and
are frequently metastatic at the time of diagnosis. These
tumors are particularly resistant to conventional therapies
with radiation and chemotherapy, even at maximally
tolerated doses, highlighting the need for novel and more
effective therapeutic options [5, 6].

Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant
pediatric brain tumor consisting of at least four distinct
molecular subgroups: Wingless (WNT), sonic hedgehog
(SHH), Group 3 and Group 4 [1, 2]. These subgroups are
characterized by divergent genetic aberrations, cytogenetic
features, and distinct phenotypes including patient
demographics and clinical outcome. Tumors with WNT

We used the Connectivity Map (C-MAP) database,
a bioinformatic tool based on gene expression, to discover
small molecule inhibitors with high likelihood of efficacy
against Group 3 medulloblastomas. The C-MAP contains
gene expression signatures of various cultured cancer cell
lines treated with a library of small molecule compounds
already approved by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) [7, 8]. This platform links drugs, genes and
diseases by measuring similarity or dissimilarity in
gene expression. Using a pattern-matching algorithm,
the program is able to identify drugs predicted to revert
the oncogenic gene signature of a given cancer to a
nonmalignant or drug-sensitive gene expression profile.
Previous studies have successfully used this approach to
identify compounds with the ability to modulate various
biological pathways or diseases [9-13].
In this study we identified subgroup-specific
signatures with genes differentially expressed between
each medulloblastoma subgroup and normal cerebellum.
We then selected the most frequently up- and downregulated genes to query the C-MAP database and obtain
a list of compounds likely to reverse the direction of gene
expression in medulloblastoma. By limiting the C-MAP
analysis to patient samples from each subgroup, we
anticipate identification of bona fide inhibitors of each
tumor subtype that might be missed if all medulloblastoma
subgroup samples were merged in the analysis. Given that
Group 3 medulloblastoma has the worst prognosis and
current therapy results in high morbidity, identification
of subgroup-specific effective compounds is a priority.
Piperlongumine (PL), a natural product isolated from the
fruit of the Piper longum and previously known to have
cytotoxic properties in cancer [14], was the top candidate
for non-WNT tumors. Alsterpaullone (ALP), a cyclindependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, was identified as a
potential therapeutic agent for Group 3 medulloblastomas.
In subsequent validation experiments we sought to
validate the predictions of this in silico drug screen. Here
we show for the first time that ALP is highly effective and
selective in treating Group 3 medulloblastoma cell lines
and xenografts. Furthermore, ALP reverses the Group 3
medulloblastoma gene signature and downregulates many
cell cycle-related genes, including MYC.

expression profile of each medulloblastoma subgroup
are listed in Table 1. PL, a natural product derived from
the plant species Piper longum, was the compound with
the highest negative enrichment score for non-WNT
medulloblastomas. The compounds identified as potential
novel therapies for WNT medulloblastomas are distinct
from the ones identified for non-WNT tumors. On the
other hand, the drugs listed for Group 3 and Group 4
tumors are very similar.
We then asked which compounds were specific for
Group 3 medulloblastomas. On top of the list, a CDK
inhibitor (ALP), a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor
(rottlerin) and two calcium channel inhibitors (denatonium
benzoate and flunarizine) showed significant negative
enrichment (Table 2).

C-MAP candidate drugs piperlongumine,
alsterpaullone, rottlerin and flunarizine reduce
proliferation of Group 3 medulloblastoma cell
lines
To validate the results of our C-MAP analysis
we selected PL (the best candidate for non-WNT
medulloblastomas) and the top three drugs predicted to
be specific for Group 3 medulloblastomas (alsterpaullone,
rottlerin and flunarizine).
We examined the effects of each drug on the
proliferation of two established Group 3 medulloblastoma
cell lines, D425 and D458, and a fetal normal human brain
culture (hf5281) [15-19]. PL and rottlerin (RTL) treatment
for 48 hours reduced cell proliferation in medulloblastoma
cells at 5 µM (Figure 1a and 1c) whereas ALP treatment
showed the same efficacy at 1 µM (Figure 1b). Treatment
with flunarizine (FZ) decreased cell proliferation at higher
concentrations (50 and 100 µM) (Figure 1d). When normal
human brain cells (hf5281) were incubated with PL, ALP
and RTL there was little reduction in cell proliferation,
even at the highest concentration tested of 10 µM, thus
indicating that these compounds may have selective
killing properties to medulloblastoma tumor cells.

RESULTS

We next investigated the efficacy of PL, ALP,
RTL and FZ in established medulloblastoma xenografts
representative of Group 3 medulloblastomas. D458
cells expressing luciferase were implanted in the right
cerebellum of nude mice and bioluminescence imaging
was performed at 6 days post inoculation. Animals
with a detectable signal were treated by subcutaneous
injection with PL (50 mg/kg, daily for 2 weeks), ALP (30
mg/kg, daily for 2 weeks), RTL (20 mg/kg, every other

day for 2 weeks), FZ (50 mg/Kg, daily for 2 weeks) or
vehicle control (10% DMSO). Marked reduction in
medulloblastoma growth was observed in mice treated
with PL, ALP and RTL when compared to DMSO-treated
controls, as confirmed by bioluminescence imaging
(Figure 2a and 2b) and by histological examination
(H&E stain) of the brains (Supplementary Figure 1a).
A significant increase in survival was also seen in mice
treated with PL (Figure 2c; p = 0.0011), ALP (Figure 2d;
p = 0.0043) and RTL (Figure 2e; p = 0.0262). As expected
by the in vitro effects of FZ in cell proliferation, only
seen at very high concentrations, this drug was not able
to prolong survival of mice bearing medulloblastoma
xenografts (Supplementary Figure 1b).
We then tested the two most promising drugs, PL
and ALP, in nude mice with D425 cerebellar xenografts
and showed that both drugs significantly increase survival
(Figure 3a and 3b; p < 0.05) and reduce medulloblastoma

growth (Figure 3c). Collectively, these results confirm
that the C-MAP top predicted drugs for Group 3
medulloblastomas are effective in treating orthotopic
mouse models of the disease.
To determine the mechanisms by which PL and
ALP exert their antitumor effect, we treated D425 and
D458 medulloblastoma cells with both drugs for 48h and
assessed apoptosis and AKT pathway inhibition. Western
blot analysis showed that ALP induced apoptosis (Figures
3d and 3e) and potently inhibited AKT pathway activation
at lower concentrations than PL (Figures 3f and 3g).

Alsterpaullone inhibits MYC and other cell cycle
related genes
To identify downstream transcriptional events
induced by ALP, we performed genomic profiling of

Interestingly, when we queried the C-MAP database
using the gene expression profiling of D425 and D458
medulloblastoma cells after treatment with ALP and PL,
we found that only ALP was able to significantly reverse
gene expression as determined by the high positive
enrichment score (0.995) and low p-value (p < 0.000001)

the other subgroups. Strikingly, methylprednisolone (a
steroid known to have a beneficial effect in brain tumors)
and four chemotherapeutic agents currently in use for
medulloblastoma treatment (etoposide, methotrexate,
semustine and lomustine) were only listed in the WNT
subgroup, which has the best response to treatment and the
best outcome. On the other hand, PL was the top ranked
compound for non-WNT medulloblastomas suggesting the
ability of this compound to reverse common biological
processes in these tumors. The predictions for Group 3
and Group 4 medulloblastomas included several shared
compounds, in agreement with the genetic similarity
between the two subgroups. Doxorubicin, a wellknown chemotherapeutic agent but not used to treat
medulloblastoma, was identified as a drug with potential
efficacy for both Group 3 and Group 4 tumors.
The top ranked compound with predicted specificity
for Group 3 medulloblastoma was ALP, a potent inhibitor
of CDK1/cyclin B and CDK 5. The cell-cycle kinases
play an important role in normal brain development and
their deregulation is associated with aberrant division
and uncontrolled proliferation in various cancers,
including malignant brain tumours [20, 21]. In cerebellar
development, cyclins D1 and D2 play a crucial role in
the postnatal expansion of the granule neuron precursors
(GNP) in the external granule layer (EGL). As these cells
exit the cell cycle and begin to differentiate, they migrate
inwards through the Purkinje cell layer to form the internal
granule layer (IGL) of the adult cerebellum [22, 23]. The

DISCUSSION
We have used an in silico gene expression-based
screening for drug discovery in medulloblastoma. Using
the Connectivity Map (C-MAP) algorithm, we identified
the CDK inhibitor ALP as a compound with the ability
to reverse the gene expression signature of Group 3
medulloblastomas and, therefore, with potential specific
antitumor effect. We validated the results obtained with
C-MAP by demonstrating the efficacy of ALP both in in
vitro and in vivo models of Group 3 medulloblastoma. Our
study provides evidence for the use of chemical genomics
to identify modulators of biological processes that drive
the medulloblastoma subgroups.
The C-MAP analysis, using the gene expression
signatures of the four molecular subgroups of
medulloblastoma, led to interesting observations. The
drugs predicted for the WNT subgroup were distinct from

SHH pathway regulates the GNPs proliferation inducing
the expression of the transcription factor GLI1, which upregulates the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin D2, via
N-MYC [24, 25]. Removal of both cyclins D1 and D2
in animal models results in severe cerebellar hypoplasia
due to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of
GNPs [26]. In Ptch+/- mice, known to develop spontaneous
cerebellar medulloblastomas, loss of cyclin D1 (Ptch+/;Ccnd1-/-) significantly reduces the incidence of tumors
[27]. On the other hand, loss of CDK inhibitors, Ink4c or
Ink4d, triggers medulloblastoma formation in p53-null
mice [28]. A recent study has shown that CDK5 is also
required for the normal development of the cerebellum.
Cdk5 conditional knockout mice display a smaller
cerebellum and a profound disturbance in migration of
granule cells [29].
Members of the Cyclin/CDK complex are frequently
amplified or up-regulated in human medulloblastoma.
Li et al. described amplifications of the CDK4, CDK6,
CCND1 (or cyclin D1) and CCND2 (or cyclin D2) genes
in primary medulloblastomas [30], raising the possibility
of using CDK inhibition to suppress medulloblastoma
formation. Interestingly, it has been shown in mouse
models of lymphoma and hepatoblastoma that MYC
sensitizes tumor cells to undergo apoptosis in response to
CDK1 inhibition, through a mechanism independent of
p53 status [31]. Due to the limited success in developing
small molecule inhibitors of MYC, targeting important
cellular processes, such as the cell cycle, may prove to be
a viable therapeutic strategy in MYC-dependent tumors,
including Group 3 medulloblastomas.
Previous studies have shown the antitumor effects
of ALP through induction of apoptosis in breast cancer
and leukemia cells [32-34]. We report for the first time
the cytotoxic effects of ALP in medulloblastoma. ALP
effectively decreased cell proliferation and induced
apoptosis through AKT pathway blockade. In mouse
xenografts of Group 3 medulloblastoma, treatment with
ALP significantly reduced tumor growth and improved
survival. Given that Paullones, including alsterpaullone,
have been identified as CDK1/CDK2/CDK5 and GSK3B
inhibitors, we examined the gene expression profiles of
the CDK genes in the Group 3 medulloblastoma cell
lines. We found that multiple CDK genes are upregulated
in untreated control medulloblastoma cells, which were
significantly inhibited in cells treated with alsterpaullone.
This supports the notion that the mechanism of action of
alsterpaullone is the targeting of CDKs which results in
the growth inhibition and apoptosis that we observed.
Future studies include characterization of CDK regulation
in Group 3 medulloblastoma.
Taken together, these experimental results confirm
the value of the C-MAP algorithm by establishing that
ALP may serve as a Group 3-specific drug. In fact, we
demonstrate that ALP down-regulates several cell cycle
related genes, including MYC, and, unlike PL, treatment
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with ALP reverses the gene expression profile of Group
3 medulloblastoma cell lines. Our chemical genomics
study provides a rationale for advancing alsterpaullone as
a targeted therapy in Group 3 medulloblastoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Connectivity map analysis
The subgroup-specific gene expression profiles of
primary medulloblastomas were obtained from previously
published datasets [1]. A list of genes differentially
expressed between each medulloblastoma subgroup and
normal cerebellum was obtained and the top 200 up- and
downregulated genes were selected to query the C-MAP
database. Compounds with a negative enrichment score,
which implies the ability to reverse the direction of
expression of the gene signature of interest, and a p-value
inferior to 0.05 were recorded as potential therapeutic
agents for medulloblastoma [7, 8].

Medulloblastoma cell lines
The medulloblastoma cell lines (D425 and D458)
were kindly provided by Dr. Annie Huang, Hospital for
Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. D458-GFP/Luciferase
cells were generated as described previously [17].

Cell proliferation assays
D425 and D458 cells were grown as suspension
cultures and seeded in 96-well microplates at 10,000
cells per well. hf5281 was grown as an adherent
culture and seeded in 96-well microplates at 4,000
and 5,000 cells per well. Cells were treated for 48h
with different concentrations of piperlongumine (PL;
INDOCINE Chemical Company), alsterpaullone (ALP;
A.G. Scientific), rottlerin (RTL; A. G. Scientific) and
flunarizine (FZ; Sigma) or DMSO (control). Cell viability
was determined by MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium) and the absorbance measured at 490 nm
(CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Reagent; Promega).
Three independent experiments were performed with 16
repeats per treatment condition.

Medulloblastoma xenografts
All mouse studies were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of
Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children, in Toronto,
and performed in accordance to their policies and
regulations.

Medulloblastoma intracranial xenografts were
established in 5-6 week old athymic nude mice (Charles
River Laboratories). Medulloblastoma cells (250,000
D425 and D458 cells) were implanted in the right
cerebellum of mice. Six days after cell inoculation,
animals were randomized into treatment cohorts, which
included subcutaneous injections with vehicle control
(10% DMSO), PL (50 mg/kg, daily for 2 weeks), ALP (30
mg/kg, daily for 2 weeks), RTL (20 mg/kg, every other
day for 2 weeks) or FZ (50 mg/Kg, daily for 2 weeks).
In
animals
bearing
D458-GFP/Luciferase
xenografts, bioluminescence imaging was performed at 6
days after intracranial injection. Mice with a detectable
signal were included in the study and tumor growth was
monitored at one-week intervals using the IVIS Spectrum
Optical In-vivo Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences).
Animals with progressive neurological signs or
weight loss greater than 20% were euthanized and the
brains harvested and fixed in 10% formalin.

and to determine if alsterpaullone and piperlongumine
were able to reverse the gene expression profile of Group
3 medulloblastoma cells (p < 0.05).

The Kaplan-Meier estimate and a log-rank test
were used to generate survival curves. Experiments were
performed in triplicate and results were expressed as
mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using
GraphPad Prism 5 Software. A p-value inferior to 0.05
was considered as significant.
