ABSTRACT
Background: c-Kit/α-PDGFR targeted therapies are effective for gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GIST), but, >50% develop drug resistance.
Methods: RTK expression (c-Kit, c-Met, AXL, HER-1, HER-2, IGF-1R) in pre-/
post-imatinib (IM) GIST patient samples (n=16) and 4 GIST cell lines were examined
for RTK inhibitor activity. GIST-882 cells were cultured in IM every other day, cells
collected (1 week to 6 months) and analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting.
Results: Immunohistochemistry pre-/post-IM demonstrated continued
expression of c-Kit and HER1, while a subset expressed IGF-1R, c-Met and AXL. In
GIST cells (GIST-882, GIST430/654, GIST48) c-Kit, HER1 and c-Met are co-expressed.
Acute IM over-express c-Kit while chronic IM, lose c-Kit and HER-1 in GIST882 cells.
GIST882 and GIST430/654 cells have an IC50 0.077 and 0.59 µM to IM respectively.
GIST48 have an IC50 0.66 µM to IM, 0.91 µM to amuvatinib [AMU] and 0.67 µM to
erlotinib (Erl). Synergistic combinations: GIST882, AMU + Erl (CI 0.20); IM + AMU
(CI 0.50), GIST430/654, IM + afatinib (CI 0.39); IM + AMU (CI 0.42), GIST48, IM +
afatinib (CI 0.03); IM + AMU (CI 0.04); AMU + afatinib (CI 0.36); IM + Erl (CI 0.63).
Conclusion: Targeting c-Kit plus HER1 or AXL/c-Met abrogates IM resistance in
GIST.

INTRODUCTION

domain mutations (~70%) (proximal and distal) [8] are
IM sensitive [3]. However, patients failing IM with exon
11 mutations acquire secondary mutations within the
ATP-binding site or activation loop and are likely also
to be resistant to SM [9]. Extracellular domain exon 9
c-KIT mutations (~12%) are frequently associated with
small intestinal GIST and require higher doses of IM for
response (600 or 800 mg) but this mutation appears also
to be sensitive to SM [2, 4]. Exon 13 N-terminal kinase
domain mutations (~1%) are rare and IM sensitive, while
exon 17 activation loop mutations, also rare (~1%) are
IM resistant [4, 8]. Approximately 10% GIST is wild
type c-Kit and resistant to IM but sensitive to SM [8, 10].
About 5-7% of GISTs have juxtamembrane (exon 12)
or activation loop (exon 18) mutations in the α-PDGFR
that are mutually exclusive with wild type c-Kit [11].
α-PDGFR mutants are generally IM resistant but may be
SM sensitive [12].

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are defined
by mutated and over-expressed oncogenic receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) c-Kit or α-PDGFR that are also
effective therapeutic targets for which imatinib mesylate
[IM (gleevec), Novartis Pharmaceuticals] an ATP-site
small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is approved
as frontline therapy in the advanced [1-4] and adjuvant [5]
settings. C-Kit directed therapies have changed the natural
history of aggressive GIST and clearly improved survival
in both settings [4, 5]. For patients with advanced disease
who are IM resistant or intolerant, sunitinib malate (SM),
a c-Kit/PDGFR/VEGFR TKI is approved as second line
therapy [6] and regorafenib in the third line setting [7] for
those patients progressed on IM and SM. Oncogenic c-Kit
mutations (~85%) in GIST result in constitutive RTK
activation: the most common exon 11 juxtamembrane

RESULTS

Chronic c-Kit directed therapies with IM or SM lead
to emergence of drug resistant GIST in >50% [~6 months
to 3 years] and there is a clear need for a better biologic
understanding of the genetic mechanisms of evolution of
drug resistance. Several alternative potential mechanisms
of drug resistance to IM and SM are currently under
active investigation. These include hemi- or homozygous
deletion of the wild type Kit allele [13], BRAF V600E
mutation (5% GIST) [14], a RTK switch (loss of c-Kit and
gain of AXL) [1], over-expression of focal adhesion kinase
(FAK) [15] and insulin like growth factor receptor I (IGF1R) amplification [16]. For patients who fail both IM and
SM and continue to have a good performance status, an
appropriate clinical trial is recommended [17]. However,
the development of novel targeted agents and their rational
combinations are urgently required to prevent and treat IM
or SM resistance.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of several
oncogenic RTKs in GIST patient specimens demonstrated
uniform expression of c-Kit and HER-1, while IM
resistant patients express IGF-1R and AXL. In 3 GIST cell
lines with single (GIST882) and double (GIST430/654
and GIST48) c-Kit mutations, c-Kit is over-expressed
in comparison to HER1 and c-Met expression which
corroborates with patient samples. Acute treatment of
GIST882 cells with IM leads to up-regulation of c-Kit
expression, while chronic IM treatment leads to loss
of c-Kit expression. The differential sensitivity of the
GIST cell lines targeting c-Kit plus HER1 or c-Kit plus
AXL/Met provide a rationale to abrogate resistance that
develops with acute and chronic IM therapy in GIST.

GIST Patient Characteristics
Sixteen patient cases were divided into two cohorts
A and B (Table 2). In Cohort A, two samples were
analyzed for Patients 2 and 4 and for Patient 1 there were
three. These samples corresponded to separate surgical
resections over the span of several years. Tumor samples
from six patients (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8) were resected prior
to IM treatment and five samples (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) were
post-IM surgical specimens. Patients (1, 2 and 4) had both
pre- and post- IM samples. There were 8 males (53%), 4
females (27%), and 3 of unknown gender. The mean age
for all samples was 58 years (51-93 years). There were
7 Caucasians (47%), 1 Asian (0.1%), 2 Hispanics (13%),
and 5 of unknown ethnicity (33%). An additional patient
(patient 16) (Table S1) was included for Western blotting
analysis for c-Kit expression.

RTK Biomarker Panel Characterization
A panel of 6 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by
IHC assays was used to characterize 15 GIST samples.
Representative images of patient 1 are shown in Figure
1A. Positivity across all samples was defined as the tumor
displaying at least 10% of tumor cells staining (Table 3).
An H-score was used to assess staining intensity (Table
S2). As expected, c-Kit expression was seen in 14 of 15
tumors (93%) with a mean intensity of an H-score of 165
(range of 0-259). Protein expression was observed for the

EGFR staining was lower than c-Kit. No differences were observed in the expression levels of c-KIT, EGFR, or PTEN when
samples are grouped based upon sex, pre- and post-IM, or cohort when data were analyzed by t-Test. PTEN was used to show
that any potential differences seen were not due to pre-analytical parameters.

HER1 and c-Met but the level of expression is 10-20 fold
higher for c-Kit compared to HER1 and c-Met (Figure
1B). GIST cell line data correlate well with IHC results
for RTK expression from debulked tumors.

Situ Hybridization (SISH). All samples analyzed for both
probes contained normal gene copy numbers (~2 copies)
signifying that the HER-1 and the IGF-1R genes were not
amplified.

In order to ascertain whether the cell culture model
recapitulates [1] the human situation, we investigated 5
GIST patients that had progressed on chronic IM therapy
and had debulking surgeries as part of their management
strategy (Table S1). Based on an expert pathology review,
snap frozen active tumors were analyzed by Western
blotting for expression of c-Kit, c-Met and AXL along
with phosphorylation of c-Met (Figure 2). Patient 1
(c-Kit+) progressed on IM and the biopsy at debulking
surgery continued to be c-Kit positive. Patient 1 was
treated with AMG706 (a c-Kit/VEGFR SMI, Phase II
clinical trial) but continued to have progressive disease.
On subsequent biopsy at the second debulking surgery
(2007), c-Kit expression was negative by IHC. Similarly,
patient 2 (c-Kit+) treated with IM for 2 years had

HER-1 mutation and deletion
IHC assays detecting the L858R mutant and
E746-A750 deletion of HER-1 were performed on all
samples. Using the previously defined criterion of IHC
staining of 10% of tumor cells or greater, all samples
were negative for both the point mutation and frame shift
deletion. Of note however, one sample (14) had faint blush
amounts of staining present for the E746-A750 deletion
assay, however this was below threshold values set for this
assay.

by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-c-Kit, anti-c-Met, anti-phospho-c-Met and anti-AXL
antibodies, respectively. GAPDH is used as a loading control.

progressive disease and IM dose was increased from
400 mg to 600 mg with stabilization of disease. Due to
progressive disease, a biopsy from a debulking surgery
showed continued c-Kit positivity. Patient 2 then was
started on SM with disease stabilization. However, due
to progressive symptomatic disease, another debulking
surgical biopsy showed c-Kit negativity by IHC. Patient
7, c-Kit maintains over-expression on IM therapy with no
evidence of AXL or c-Met induction. However, patient
7 was resistant to IM and SM, which may be due to
acquired secondary mutations. Patient 16, c-Kit expression
is lost with IM treatment but there is induction of AXL
expression. Patient 4, c-Kit continues to be over-expressed
despite IM/SM therapy and there is a modest expression of
AXL and c-Met RTKs. The resistance to IM here appears
to be mixed (secondary c-Kit mutations and alternative
RTK expression). Together these observations support the
notion that RTK driven down stream signaling pathways
continue to be activated and provide a survival and
proliferative advantage in c-Kit negative GIST patients.

duration of treatment (Table 5). In contrast, c-Met and
AXL message RNA increased by ~3-fold and ~2.4-fold
respectively compared to untreated cells. Furthermore,
HGF (c-Met ligand) and Gas6 (AXL ligand) message
RNA increased ~8-fold and ~20-fold respectively
implicating an autocrine mechanism of activation. These
results suggest that acute therapy with IM may lead to loss
of c-Kit expression with gain of expression and activation
of AXL and c-Met via an autocrine loop.
In medium to long term culture of GIST882 cells
treated with IM (0.5µM), showed a significant decrease in
the c-Kit message from 27-fold at 3 months to 4-fold at 6
months compared to control (Figure 3A). This observation
was confirmed by c-Kit protein level which decreased by
~50% at 4 months (compared to 3 months) and complete
loss at 5 and 6 months (Figure 3B) consistent with our
prior observations [1]. HER1 expression also diminished
at 4 months of IM therapy (Figure 3B). The ‘control, 6
months’ (Figure 3B) are GIST882 cells grown without IM
with the media changed every other day. The GIST882
cells were not split during the course of the study in order
to maintain continuity between the samples and reached
100% confluency prior to the 6 month termination of the
experiment. These GIST cells do not express c-Kit, most
likely, due to cell cycle arrest. RT-PCR for AXL showed
dramatic increases in message from 120 to 340-fold
compared to control (Figure 3A). However, c-Met showed
an increase message from 14-fold (3, 4 months) to 18 to
22-fold (5, 6 months) compared to control (Figure 3A).
In contrast, no changes in mRNA levels were observed
for IGF-1R and HER-1 with duration of treatment (Figure
3A).

Development of IM resistance with short and long
term culture of GIST cells
The IC50 for IM in the GIST882 cell line is 0.077 –
0.14 µM [1]. When confluent GIST882 cells are incubated
in IM at 0.5 µM (3.5 – 6.5 fold x IC50), they can be
cultured with continuous exposure to IM. GIST882 cells
were treated with 0.5 µM IM for 1, 2, 4 weeks (acute) and
2, 3, 4 and 6 months (chronic) maintained to confluence.
In short term culture, RT-PCR for c-Kit showed a 1.5fold decrease in mRNA compared to untreated cells with

Novel RTK combination therapies overcome IMresistant GIST

with IM plus erlotinib and amuvatinib plus afatinib (Table
7). Moreover, amuvatinib plus afatinib is also antagonistic
in GIST430/654 cells.
Western blotting analyses of GIST48 cells treated
with synergistic combinations amuvatinib + erlotinib, or
amuvatinib + afatinib or amuvatinib + IM at IC50 at 60
min indicate complete inhibition of c-Kit phosphorylation
(Y719) in comparison to single agent IM, amuvatinib,
erlotinin and afatinib (Figure 6). MTS cytotoxicity
corroborates with in vitro phosphorylation of the
c-Kit enzyme activity as a mechanism of efficacy for
combination therapy.

The goal was to investigate the efficacy of single
agent RTK SMIs (IM, SM, amuvatinib, erlotinib,
afatinib) on IM sensitive and resistant GIST cell lines.
MTS cytotoxicity assays for GIST882, GIST48 and
GIST430/654 cells treated with single agent serial
dilutions of IM, amuvatinib, erlotinib and afatinib with
IC50 (µM ±95% CI) are shown in Figure 4 and tabulated
(Table 6) indicated differential sensitivity and resistance
to therapy. Included in Table 6 are the IC50 data for SM.
GIST882 cells are sensitive to IM (0.077 µM) and SM
(0.068 µM) but resistant to amuvatinib (6.91 µM), erlotinib
(4.86 µM) and afatinib (7.50 µM) (Table 6); GIST48 cells
are sensitive to IM (0.66 µM), amuvatinib (0.91 µM) and
erlotinib (0.67 µM) but resistant to sunitinib (4.65 µM)
and afatinib (8.58 µM) (Table 6); GIST430/654 cells are
sensitive to SM (0.15µM) and IM (0.59 µM) and resistant
to amuvatinib (4.02 µM) and HER1 inhibitors (Table 6).
Combination studies were conducted to determine
the equipotent ratios for the 3 GIST cell lines. The
relationship of combinations with IM (Figure 5A,B,C)
and amuvatinib (Figure 5D, E) were determined by
calculating the ratios of their respective ED50 values from
the single dose studies. Equipotent ratios for the respective
combinations are incorporated within Figure 5A-E.
Combinations (CI values) with IM show strong synergy
with HER1 SMIs in GIST48 and GIST430/654 cells.
In contrast, amuvatinib plus HER1 SMIs are strongly
synergistic in all 3 GIST cell lines. An antagonistic
pharmacological interaction is observed in GIST882 cells

DISCUSSION
In GIST patients, drug resistance is associated
with distinct molecular and clinical features due to
development of secondary mutations within the c-Kit
kinase domain and alternative mechanisms of resistance
[1, 9, 10]. However, with acute IM therapy c-Kit+ GIST
cells undergo apoptosis via histone H2AX, but a side
population of cells enters G0 and quiescence [19]. With
acute-on-chronic IM therapy, c-Kit is down-regulated and
new RTKs (e.g. c-Met, AXL) gain expression in a novel
‘RTK switch’ [1]. The underlying questions regarding the
specific cause(s) of drug resistance, how tumors adapt, and
new treatment options required to abrogate drug resistance
needs further investigation.
We examined the expression patterns of several
RTKs (c-Kit, c-Met, AXL, HER-1, HER-2, and IGF-1R) in
GIST patients by IHC to identify therapeutic opportunities
that may help prevent and/or overcome drug resistance.

Expression of c-Kit in 14 of 15 tumors (93%) was strong
and homogeneous confirming signaling via this RTK is a
primary driver of tumor growth [20]. Further, HER-1 was
also homogenously positive in 14 of 15 GIST specimens
(93%) [21], with patient 9 lacking both c-Kit and HER1. A few GIST cases do have HER-1 amplification
(5.3%) and HER1 expression was reported in 96% of
GIST samples tested [22]. No evidence of HER1 gene
amplification was detected in 15 GIST samples consistent
with a FISH analysis of GIST [23]. We did not detect the
existence of HER-1 E746-A750 deletion and L858R point
mutation [24], where 60 GIST were sequenced for HER-1
demonstrated no mutations.
IGF-1R was positive only in patients 4 and 5 with
a normal IGF-1R gene copy number indicating it is a rare
RTK expressed on GIST. Patient 4 had medium to strong
expression for c-KIT, HER-1, and IGF-1R. In contrast,
patient 5 was c-Kit negative and weakly positive for HER1. Fifteen GIST specimens tested by IHC for c-Met and
HER-2 were negative but all stained positive for AXL
(Figure 1A). Western blotting analysis of GIST patients
showed AXL positivity in 1, 2, 4, 7 and 16 and c-Met
positivity in 1, 2 and 4 (Figure 2, Table S1).
The development of IM resistance in short-term
culture of GIST882 cells treated with a high dose of IM
(3.5-fold dose of IC50) for 1, 2 and 4 weeks demonstrated
c-Kit over-expression at 1 week, followed by loss of
expression at 2 and 4 weeks (Table 5). In contrast, ligandreceptor pairs HGF-c-Met and Gas6-AXL are overexpressed in a time-dependent manner (Table 5). In 2
IM-resistant patients, [1], RT-PCR for HGF and Gas6
showed increased expression and both of these patients
also over-expressed c-Met and AXL (Figure 2) implying
an autocrine mechanism of activation. In GIST-T1 cells
(c-Kit exon 11 mutation) over-expression of Cas-L and Src
activation was proposed to be a mechanism of resistance
to IM [25] but no confirmatory data was provided in
human GIST specimens.
Since several RTKs are expressed in GIST patients
(Figure 1A) and GIST cell lines (Figure 1B), we evaluated
single agent activity (Figure 4, Table 6) and combination
therapy (Figure 5, Table 7) for synergy that may help
overcome drug resistance. Of the single agents, IM
is 10-fold more active in GIST882 (exon 11 K642E)
than in GIST48 (exon 11 and 17 missense mutation)
or GIST430/654 (exon 11 in-frame deletion and exon
13 V654A) cells. SM is equipotent to IM in GIST882,
however, is more potent that IM in GIST430/654 but
inferior to IM in GIST48 cells likely due to the c-Kit
exon 17 mutation. Amuvatinib and erlotinib are equally
active in GIST48 cells but have modest activity in
GIST882 and GIST430/654 cells (Table 6) most likely
due higher expression of c-Met and HER1 respectively
(Figure 1B). In GIST882 cells, IM plus erlotinib was
antagonistic, however, in GIST430/654 and GIST48
cells this combination showed strong synergy and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

corroborated with that observed for IM plus afatinib. The
ineffectiveness of IM plus erlotinib or afatinib in GIST882
cells is likely due to activation of alternative signaling
pathway(s). Highly synergistic combinations for GIST882
are AMU + erlotinib (CI 0.20) and IM + AMU (CI 0.50);
for GIST430/654 are IM + afatinib (CI 0.39) and IM +
AMU (CI 0.42); for GIST48 are IM + afatinib (CI 0.03),
IM + AMU (CI 0.04), AMU + afatinib (CI 0.36) and
IM + erlotinib (CI 0.63) (Table 7). GIST48 cells treated
with synergistic combinations of RTK inhibitors at IC50
demonstrated complete inhibition of c-Kit phosphorylation
(Y719) in comparison to single agent IM (Figure 6)
implicating cross-talk between these pathways. Signaling
through c-Kit remains pivotal to all 3 GIST cell lines,
however, inhibition of c-Met and HER1 provides an
additional mechanism to turn off dominant c-Kit signaling.
The mechanism of pharmacologic antagonism of IM plus
erlotinib and amuvatinib plus afatinib in GIST882 and
GIST48 cells in under investigation.
Collectively, our findings suggest that targeting
multiple RTKs on GIST is more effective than single
agent RTK therapy targeting predominantly c-Kit or
α-PDGFR and/or VEGFR2. Given a broader knowledge
of the mutational status and expression levels of c-Kit in
IM-sensitive and resistant GIST patients, targeting c-Kit
plus HER1 (IM or amuvatinib plus erlotinib or afatinib)
or c-Kit plus c-Met/AXL (IM plus amuvatinib) with novel
combinations of RTK inhibitors abrogates IM resistance
in GIST. Synergistic relationships between drugs are
the most advantageous interactions in terms of response
rates and reduced side effects and should be pursued
as potential novel therapeutic strategies for treatment
of GIST. Clinical trials are warranted to evaluate these
combinations in GIST patients failing c-Kit directed
therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
GIST Patient Specimens
Through an IRB approved protocol, IM and/or SM
resistant GIST patients who had failed [tumor(s) had
grown >20% from baseline using Response Evaluation
Criteria for Solid Tumors] after >2 months of treatment
with IM at 600 mg or 800 mg or SM at 50 mg (4 weeks
on/ 2 weeks off) or 37.5 mg orally daily respectively
were banked as both frozen and paraffin samples. All
tissue samples were de-identified in accordance with
HIPPA regulations. There were also five GIST patients
who underwent debulking surgery at various times for
symptomatic progressive disease and excess tissue was
divided for paraffin and frozen sections. All patient
materials were supplied as formalin fixed, paraffin
embedded (FFPE) tissues. Two cohorts of patient samples
1962

were obtained to investigate receptor tyrosine kinase
expression. Tissue blocks and patient information of
Cohort A (n=9) were obtained from Dr. Mahadevan’s
GIST patients (pre- and post-IM) from the University of
Arizona Cancer Center (Tucson). Cohort B samples (n=7)
were GIST patients (IM naïve) de-bulked prior to IM
therapy obtained from Ventana Medical Systems (Tucson).

Pfizer oncology (investigator initiated research grant
to Dr. Mahadevan). Amuvatinib (MP470) and erlotinib
(150 mg tablets, Genentech, CA) was synthesized and
purified respectively by the University of Arizona Cancer
Center chemistry core facility (Dr. E. Mash). Afatanib
was purchased from Selleck chemicals (Houston, USA).
RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium and fetal bovine
serum were purchased from Cellgro (Manassas, VA).
Anti-c-Kit (C-19) antibody was obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphoc-Kit (Tyr719) and anti-GAPDH (14C10) antibodies
were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA).
Mouse anti-c-Met (3D4) antibody was bought from
Zymed (South San Francisco,  CA). Anti-Phospho-cMet (Tyr1230/1234/1235) was from Thermo Scientific
(Rockford, IL). Anti-AXL was from Abnova (Walnut, CA)
and R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), respectively.
IM sensitive (GIST882-S) and IM resistant
(GIST882-R, GIST430/654, GIST48) cell lines were
cultured in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks with RPMI1640
containing 15% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% L-glutamine.
Culture media was replaced three times per week. Cells
were grown in a humid atmosphere set at 37oC with 5%
CO2 and were demonstrated to be free of mycoplasma
using PCR analysis.

GIST IHC and Western Blotting
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed
using Ventana’s BenchMark XT automated staining
platform in collaboration with Arizona Cancer Center
(AZCC) tissue acquisition and cellular/molecular analysis
(TACMASS, Dr. R. Nagle). Antibodies to c-Kit, AXL,
c-Met, HER1, HER2, HER1 (L858R mutant specific),
HER1 (E746-A750, deletion specific), IGF-1R, and
PTEN were utilized for IHC analysis (Table 1). The FFPE
tissue samples were sectioned at 4 µM and transferred in
a water bath onto Superfrost Plus slides (VWR, Catalog
No. 48311-703). H&E stains were performed on all
tissues prior to IHC. The H&E stains were reviewed by a
pathologist (Dr. R. Nagle) to verify tumor presence, tissue
integrity and cell viability. Staining for PTEN was used as
a positive control to evaluate tissue quality. Samples are
flagged if PTEN staining of these elements was weak or
uneven across the specimen and rejected if there was no
staining. Antibody diluent was substituted for the primary
antibody as a negative control across all samples. All
IHC assays used the ultraView Universal DAB detection
chemistry (Ventana; Cat #760-500). The secondary
antibody, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is a biotinfree multimer complex. For these assays, the secondary
antibody and all chromogen reagents were applied using
the instrument’s default times. Snap-frozen sections were
utilized for Western blotting analysis for c-Kit, c-Met and
AXL expression and c-Met phosphorylation.

Cell Viability Assays
GIST882, GIST430/654 and GIST48 cells were
seeded into 96-well plates at a cellular density of 5.0 x 104
per well. Cells were incubated for 24 hr to allow for ample
time for attachment to the well. After 24 hr cells were
treated with graded concentrations of IM, SM, erlotinib,
afatinib and amuvatinib in six replicates in 0.1% DMSO
including a DMSO only control. For combination studies,
treatments were performed in the same manner. Median
effects from each of the single treatments were used to
establish an equipotent ratio, a ratio of the respective
ED50’s. The equipotent ratio was utilized to form a dosing
scheme from which new dose median effects could be
obtained for further analysis of drug interactions. A
mixture of drug combinations up to 10-fold the equipotent
ratio was administered to the GIST cells. A control group
was established for each drug treatment in six replicates.
The cells were exposed to the respective treatments for 96
hr. Cell viability was determined through the CellTiter96
Aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay (MTS).
Absorbance readings at 490 nm were analyzed against the
control group for each drug treatment to determine cell
viability.
The efficacies of various treatments were expressed
as the dose median (Dm), also known as the effective dose
at 50% (ED50). The median effect equation fa/fu = (D/Dm)
m
, where fa and fu represent the fraction of cells affected
and unaffected by the dose, D. Cell viability curves for
each treatment was obtained using GraphPad prism 2.1

In-Situ Hybridization
Ventana’s fully automated silver in situ hybridization
method (SISH) was developed to detect the HER1 gene
status in FFPE tissues (VMSI, Catalog No. 780-001).
Staining was performed on Ventana’s BenchMark XT
automated slide platform. In the present study, scoring
consisted of distinguishing non-amplified (~2 gene copies)
from amplified (>2 gene copies) status.

Reagents and Cells
Imatinib
mesylate
(Gleevec,
Novartis
Pharmaceuticals) was purchased from 21CEC PX
Pharmaceuticals Ltd (Shanghai, China). Sunitinib malate
(Sutent, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals) was received from

Quantitative Real Time RT–PCR

(GraphPad Software, CA) and the median effects and
statistical analyses were obtained using Calcusyn software
(Biosoft, MO). Statistical analysis of the viability assays
was conducted using standard error calculations with a
95% confidence interval. Linear correlation coefficient
values (r) were determined for each treatment based off
the median-effect plots. Sigmoidicity (m) of the D-R
curve was determined for each treatment. The effects
of the combined treatments were determined by the
combination-index and isobologram methods derived from
the median-effect principle of Chou and Talalay [18]. The
combination-index (CI) method quantifies a combined
drug interaction through the analysis of fractional cell
kill derived from enzyme kinetic models that determine
additive effects. The Calcusyn software was utilized to
calculate the CI values for each drug combination for
effective dose at 50% (ED50) fractional cell kill.

Quantitative real-time RT–PCR was carried out on
RNAs isolated from GIST cells treated with IM at 0.5 µM
for 1, 2 or 4 weeks. First strand cDNA was synthesized
by reverse transcription using Superscript III first strand
synthesis kit (Invitrogen), and then the real-time PCR was
performed on the ABI 7000 real time PCR system (PerkinElmer, Branchburg, NJ) with SYBR Green PCR Master
Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primers
(forward/reverse) used in RT-PCR were: c-Kit, c-Met,
AXL, IGF-1R, HER1, HGF, Gas6 and internal standard
GAPDH. Data is provided as a threshold cycle value (Ct)
for each sample, which indicates the cycle at which a
statistically significant increase in fluorescence is detected.
The data are normalized to GAPDH, which serves as an
unaffected control gene for each data point and compared
with untreated control to determine relative expression
ratios. Each measurement was performed in triplicate.

IM Resistant GIST cell line analysis and drug
combination studies

IHC Data Analysis

GIST882 cells were treated with 0.5 µM IM for
1, 2, 4 weeks (acute) and 3, 4, 5 and 6 months (chronic)
maintained to confluence. Fresh IM was added every
other day and any floating cells were removed. At the
end of each treatment time point, cells were harvested
for analysis of c-Kit, c-Met, HER1, IGF-1R, AXL, HGF
and Gas6 by real-time RT-PCR or Western blotting.
GIST430/654 (100nM IM) and GIST48 cell are cultured
(above) and analyzed for RTK expression.

High resolution images of the IHC stained samples
were captured using Aperio’s (Vista, CA) ScanScope XT.
For statistical purposes, the staining intensity categories
were converted to a semi-quantitative scale of 0 (negative),
1, 2 and 3. The percentage of pixels staining positively at
each intensity level was recorded. In order to generate a
single parametric value, H-scores were generated for each
sample. An H score, which combines the components of
staining intensity and the percentage of positive cells on
a scale from 0 to 300, is defined as: [1* (percentage of
pixels staining at 1)] + [2* (percentage of pixels staining
at 2)] + [3* (percentage of pixels staining at 3)] H-Score.
Data analysis was performed using the t-Test: two-sample
assuming unequal variances (Microsoft Office Excel
2007).

Immunoblotting
GIST cells or excess tissue from patients (snap
frozen) were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer containing
50 mM Tris.HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM Sodium Fluoride, and 2 µl/ml
Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Protein
concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein
assay kit (Hercules, CA), and 50 µg of protein were
resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel.
The proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane and nonspecific binding was blocked by
incubating with 5% nonfat milk in TBST buffer (0.01 M
Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5% Tween-20, pH 8.0) for 1
hr at room temperature. The membrane was subjected to
the indicated antibodies, and the proteins were detected
by a LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. Western
blotting was performed to confirm the real time RT-PCR
with the indicated antibodies on the GIST882 cell line
treated with IM at 0.5 µM for 1, 2 and 4 weeks.
