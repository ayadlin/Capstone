BACKGROUND: Randomized trials demonstrating the benefits of chemotherapy in patients with American Joint Committee on
Cancer stage III colon cancer underrepresent persons aged  75 years. The generalizability of these studies to a growing elderly population remains unknown. METHODS: Using the California Cancer Registry for 1994 through 2008, the authors conducted a population-based study of postcolectomy patients aged 50 years to 94 years with stage III (N1M0) colon adenocarcinoma. A 2-sided chisquare test and Cochran-Armitage test for trend were used to compare patient and tumor characteristics associated with receipt of
chemotherapy across age groups. Multivariate regression was used to assess the association between older age and receipt of chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used to evaluate the association between chemotherapy and mortality, with propensity score adjustment. RESULTS: Approximately 44% (12,382 patients) of the study cohort was aged 
75 years. Persons aged  75 years were found to be less likely to have received adjuvant chemotherapy than those aged < 75 years
(30% vs 68% in patients aged 50 years-74 years; P < .0001). On multivariate analysis, patients aged 75 years to 84 years were
13 times less likely, and those aged 85 years to 94 years were 24 times less likely, to have received chemotherapy as patients aged 50
years to 64 years. Nevertheless, age-stratified multivariate survival analyses indicated that chemotherapy provided comparable mortality reduction across age groups. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of persons aged  75 years receiving adjuvant chemotherapy
remains low despite demonstrated survival benefits. These findings deserve attention within the context of a patient’s life expectancy,
underlying comorbidities, and performance status, as well as clinician bias. The results of the current study support the call for phase
II/III studies assessing the toxicities and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of stage III colon cancer in the elderly.

INTRODUCTION
Colon cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide.1 In 2010, > 100,000 persons were expected to be diagnosed
with this malignancy in the United States, 40% of whom present with lymph node-positive disease and are recommended
to receive adjuvant chemotherapy.1-3 Because the median age at the time of colon cancer diagnosis is currently 72 years in
the United States,1 several estimates have predicted that elderly patients with colon cancer will represent a large percentage
of oncology patients in the future. As a result, the number of inpatient surgeries for patients with colon cancer in
the United States is forecast to grow quickly through 2025.4 In an era of limited resources, understanding trends and
the potential benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in the elderly will be an important tool to aid in clinicians’ day-to-day
practice and decision-making.
The underrepresentation of older adults in clinical trials has been a long-standing issue and recent calls for changes
in policy have highlighted the multifactorial causes of this problem.5 Level I evidence supporting adjuvant chemotherapy
in patients with stage III (ie, lymph node-positive) colon cancer has limited generalizability to actual practice involving
patients aged > 75 years. Randomized trials have demonstrated that adjuvant systemic chemotherapy provides a 33%
reduction in mortality and a 24% reduction in disease recurrence in younger patients (those aged 18 years-75 years) with
few comorbidities.6 Pooled analyses of the safety and efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in the elderly (defined in these
studies as individuals aged  70 years or  60 years) have shown comparable toxicity rates and similar survival benefits

compared with younger patients.7,8 However, these elderly patients were all enrolled in clinical trials and were
known to have a more favorable performance status and
fewer comorbidities compared with the general elderly
population. Subsequent population-based studies have
suggested that older persons (examined variably in these
studies in 5-year increments beginning at age 65 years9,10
or categorized as aged < 75 years vs aged  75 years11)
were less likely to have received adjuvant therapy, but
experienced similar survival rates compared with younger
patients.9-11 However, many of these studies were
conducted before the incorporation of contemporary
therapeutic agents such as oxaliplatin into the adjuvant
chemotherapy regimen. Overall, the efficacy of chemotherapy in the elderly population has been demonstrated
in only a highly selected group of elderly patients
who were enrolled in clinical trials. As a result, studies
providing additional evidence to guide clinician decisionmaking regarding the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in
older persons with stage III colon cancer (according to the
sixth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer
[AJCC]) are desirable.
We hypothesized that outside of the clinical trial setting, the likelihood that adjuvant chemotherapy will be
administered will decrease with a patient’s advancing age,
despite a comparable survival benefit across all age groups.
Using a population-based cohort of patients with AJCC
stage III colon cancer who were representative of realworld experience, this study: 1) identified the percentage
of elderly patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy; 2)
assessed the association between older age and receipt of
chemotherapy; and 3) evaluated the survival benefit associated with adjuvant chemotherapy across age groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Database

We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort
study using the 1994 through 2008 California Cancer
Registry (CCR).12 The CCR is California’s statewide cancer
surveillance system. Abstractors collect data from 10 registries encompassing the state’s 58 counties according to
documented standards concerning demographics, cancer
type, extent of disease, treatment, and survival. Information
regarding the first course of therapy is provided but does not
include specific chemotherapy agents, dosages, or information concerning the duration/completion of therapy.
Case Inclusions

We limited our cohort to patients diagnosed with colon
cancers (rectum excluded) between 1994 and 1998
396

including the cecum; ascending, transverse, and descending colon; hepatic and splenic flexures; sigmoid cancers;
and those coded as colon, not otherwise specified (International Classification of Disease for Oncology [ICD-0]
codes C180 and 182-189). Furthermore, we included
only patients diagnosed after age 50 years, which corresponds to the age at which guidelines recommend the initiation of colorectal cancer screening. This also provided a
meaningful referent. Our upper age limit was 94 years to
allow for appropriate analytic cell size and to preserve
anonymity.
Case Exclusions

We excluded patients diagnosed before 1994 because the
CCR allowed blank fields for variables critical for the
analysis, including extent of disease and lymph node positivity, before this time. In addition, because we were interested only in patients diagnosed with AJCC stage III
disease with known treatment status, we excluded those
patients with in situ disease, unknown T classification and
lymph node and chemotherapy status, negative lymph
nodes, and metastatic disease. Finally, cases identified via
death certificates or nursing home records were also
excluded because these patients would be unlikely to have
undergone treatment for their disease. Figure 1 shows a
complete list of cohort ascertainment.
Definition of Adjuvant Chemotherapy

The CCR collects information regarding the first course
of therapy, including chemotherapy, through the abstraction of hospital and treatment facility records. For the
purposes of abstraction, the CCR defines treatment
(including adjuvant chemotherapy) as all therapy received
before disease progression or treatment failure. If disease
progression or treatment failure is not documented, the
first course of treatment is considered to be that occurring
within 1 year of diagnosis. Chemotherapy is then classified by the CCR as 1) none; 2) chemotherapy, not otherwise specified; 3) single or multiagent; 4) contraindicated;
5) patient died before administration; or 6) recommended
but not administered and unknown. For the current
study, we considered responses of chemotherapy, not otherwise specified and single or multiple agents as indicative
of receipt of chemotherapy (yes or no).
Constructed Variables

We constructed T classification by AJCC staging from the
extent of disease variable in the CCR. Substaging and
reclassifications between the sixth and seventh editions of
the AJCC staging manual did not affect our variable classifications. Well-differentiated and moderately differentiated tumors were considered to be low grade, whereas

receipt, adjusting for potential confounders. Independent
variables included in multivariate analyses included sex,
tumor grade, race, T classification, and insurance status.
We assessed cancer-specific survival for the entire cohort
using Cox proportional hazards regression. Cause of death
was identified using ICD codes from the 9th or 10th
editions (depending on the year of death) to distinguish
cancer-specific death (codes 1400-2399 in ICD-9 and
‘‘C’’ codes for ICD-10) from other causes of death. Interactions were evaluated and an age-stratified analysis was
performed. Propensity score analysis was used to decrease
confounding by covariates, so that outcomes (survival)
could be attributed to treatment (chemotherapy). Because
we recognized that the probability of receiving chemotherapy varies by demographic factors, we adjusted for
this probability in our survival analysis. In the current
study, we created a variable that represents the likelihood
of receiving chemotherapy based on demographic factors,
and then adjusted for this variable in our base survival
model. Propensity scores were computed using macros
developed by Kosanke and Bergstralh of the Mayo Clinic
(http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/biostat/sasmacros.cfm)
and those scores were included as covariates in the Cox
proportional hazards regression. We performed sensitivity analyses, which are detailed below. We considered
results to be statistically significant at a P value of .05
using 2-sided tests when applicable. All analyses were
performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.2;
SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). The study was approved
by the institutional Human Subjects Committee of the
University of Minnesota.

poorly differentiated and undifferentiated tumors were
considered to be high grade. Age was grouped as follows:
50 years to 64 years, 65 years to 74 years, 75 years to 84
years, and 85 years to 94 years.

RESULTS
Table 1 summarizes the demographic and tumor characteristics of the cohort in the current study. Of this cohort
(N ¼ 27,805), 32% were aged 75 years to 84 years and
13% were aged 85 years to 94 years. The oldest age group
had a higher percentage of patients who were white,
female, and had a higher T classification. Among the
elderly, a higher percentage presented with T4 tumors
(22% in those aged 85 years-94 years vs 18% in those
aged 50 years-64 years; P < .0001).

Female and nonwhite patients were less likely to receive
chemotherapy (Table 2). Older patients were less likely to
receive multiagent therapy (34% of those aged < 75 years
vs 23% of those aged  75 years received multiagent
therapy; P < .0001).
During the study period, the overall percentage of
persons receiving adjuvant chemotherapy ranged from
48% to 53% (P ¼ .0101). Similarly, among patients aged
 75 years, these percentages ranged from 26% to 33%
(P ¼ .0039).
Multivariate Predictors of Receipt of
Chemotherapy

After adjusting for sex, race, year of diagnosis, tumor
grade, T classification, and insurance status, older age was
found to be strongly predictive of not receiving chemotherapy. Patients aged < 75 years were 4.8 times more
likely to receive chemotherapy than those aged  75 years

(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.6-5.1). Furthermore, compared with those aged 85 years to 94 years,
patients aged 50 years to 64 years were 24 times more
likely to receive chemotherapy, those aged 65 years to 74
years were 13 times more likely to receive chemotherapy,
and those aged 75 years to 84 years were 5 times more
likely to receive chemotherapy than the oldest group. The
magnitude of the effect of age as a predictor of chemotherapy receipt was 10-fold higher than the effect of other variables. For example, white patients were 1.2 times more
likely to receive chemotherapy than black patients and
insured patients were 1.6 times more likely as uninsured
patients to receive chemotherapy. Sex did not appear to be
predictive of receipt of chemotherapy (Table 3).
We next constructed a model predictive of multiagent (vs single agent) chemotherapy receipt. After adjusting for year of diagnosis, sex, race, tumor grade, T
classification, and insurance, patients aged 50 years to 64

years were 5.5 times as likely to receive multiagent therapy
as the oldest age group (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; 95% CI,
3.9-7.8). Similarly, patients aged 65 years to 74 years were
3.8 times as likely to receive multiagent therapy as the oldest age group (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.7-5.4).
To assess whether therapy refusal influenced these
findings, we constructed a model predicting chemotherapy refusal, which included only those patients who had
received or refused chemotherapy. Overall, 6.0% of
patients refused therapy (n ¼ 900). We found that
increasing age strongly predicted refusal. Approximately
1.8% of patients aged 50 years to 64 years refused, 3.6%
of patients aged 65 years to 74 years refused, 12% of those
aged 75 years to 84 years refused, and 31% of those aged
 85 years refused (P < .0001). Other significant predictors included increasing T classification, female sex, and
uninsured status. Race was not found to be predictive of

chemotherapy refusal (Table 4). Nevertheless, the exclusion of patients who refused chemotherapy did not affect
estimates for age as a predictor of chemotherapy receipt.
Cancer-Specific Survival

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated comparable
unadjusted survival benefits across age groups. The 5-year
survival rate among those aged  75 years who were
receiving chemotherapy was 55% compared with 43% for
nonrecipients (P < .0001). The 5-year survival rate
among patients aged 85 years to 94 years who received
chemotherapy was 43% versus 38% among nonrecipients
(P ¼ .0002).
Adjusted analysis further demonstrated the benefit
of chemotherapy in older patients. After adjusting for age,
sex, diagnosis year, tumor grade, race, T classification,
and insurance status, chemotherapy receipt was associated

with a 27% reduction in cancer-specific death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.70-0.77 [P < .001]). To test
this benefit in older patients, we examined an age-chemotherapy interaction. This interaction was significant (P ¼
.0014), suggesting that the benefit of chemotherapy was
different across age groups. Subsequent stratification by
age group demonstrated that chemotherapy conferred an
11% mortality reduction in patients aged 50 years to 64
years, a reduction of 20% in patients aged 65 years to 74
years, a reduction of 30% in patients aged 75 years to 84
years, and a mortality reduction of 29% for those aged 
85 years. An explanation for the differences in adjusted
survival noted across age groups is explored later in this article, and likely represents selection bias.

Sensitivity Analysis

We performed several additional analyses to test that our
findings were not a result of modeling decisions. First,
because chemotherapy may not be given in the context of
a poor postoperative course, we created models predicting
chemotherapy only for those patients who had survived 3
months and 6 months after diagnosis. Second, because
older person are more likely to have had prior cancers,
which may alter decisions involving chemotherapy, we
repeated our analyses adjusting for this factor. We also
adjusted for the number of lymph nodes examined (as a
marker of quality of care). These repeated analyses indicated that our age estimates remained comparable (data
not shown).

Propensity Score Analysis

To control for selection bias, we calculated the likelihood
of chemotherapy receipt by patient demographics and
tumor characteristics as a propensity score. We adjusted
for this score in the Cox proportional hazards regression
analyses. HRs changed minimally after adjustment, as
shown in Figure 2; for comparison, below each forest plot
is the respective HR without propensity score adjustment.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, older age was found to be the strongest predictor of not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy,
although propensity score-adjusted mortality reduction
from chemotherapy was comparable among all patients of
all ages. Although other factors such as race and insurance
status appear to influence receipt of chemotherapy,

the magnitude of the effect of age as a predictor of chemotherapy receipt was 10-fold higher than other predictors.
These results suggest that even after adjusting for important covariates, a 64-year-old patient is 24 times more
likely to receive chemotherapy than a patient aged
85 years, with a comparable relative survival benefit.
Over the past 15 years, the literature has provided
various reports of the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in
elderly patients. The results of the current study are
consistent with early studies demonstrating that older age
is associated with decreased receipt of chemotherapy. In
fact, our adjusted ORs closely match those obtained in a
previously published study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data from 1991
through 1996,13 shedding light on the gap between the
efficacy demonstrated by cancer clinical trials and realworld practice. This gap leaves clinicians without applicable evidence on which to base treatment decisions.
Contrary to the current study findings, 2 studies
have shown that the percentage of elderly patients receiving chemotherapy has increased over time.11,14 For example, although 20% of patients aged  80 years received
chemotherapy between 1990 and 1991, these percentages
had increased to nearly 40% according to National Cancer Data Base data from 2001 to 2002.14 However, in the
current study, the percentages of older patients receiving
chemotherapy were lower and remained constant over the
study period. The likely explanation for these differences
lies in our recent cohort. In approximately 2004, randomCancer

ized trials attributed an additional disease-free survival
benefit to treatment with oxaliplatin6,15; however, its
higher toxicities16,17 undoubtedly contributed to lower
administration rates in older populations.18,19 The lower
rates of multiagent therapy in older populations demonstrated in the current study support this explanation. This
analysis and other more recent studies may capture a plateau in chemotherapy administration associated with the
introduction of oxaliplatin-based regimens,11 although
we must stress that the combination of 5-fluorouracil and
leucovorin or capecitabine remain very appropriate
options with demonstrated benefits in elderly patients.
It should be noted that the higher hazard reduction
observed with receipt of chemotherapy in older persons
(11% better survival in patients aged 50 years-64 years
who received chemotherapy compared with those who
did not, compared with 29% better survival in patients
aged 85 years-94 years who received chemotherapy compared with those who did not) should not be taken to suggest that older patients experience a greater benefit from
chemotherapy than younger patients. The likely explanations for these differences is selection bias, by which only
the healthiest elderly or those with a favorable performance status are even offered chemotherapy and therefore
are more likely to have better survival regardless of therapy. In the context of the hypothesis of the current study,
we believe that the survival benefit associated with chemotherapy is comparable across all age groups.
The strengths of the current study include providing
a contemporary analysis of real-world clinical practice.
Low enrollment of elderly patients into trials is a longstanding problem and extrapolating trial data to these
populations is not necessarily appropriate.5,20 Given
increasing life expectancies, patients aged  75 years will
be a substantial component of oncologic practice in the
future. However, without trials inclusive of these age
groups, the results of the current study offer the important
perspective of a current, large, and diverse population of
elderly patients whose experiences and survival provide
important surrogate data. Our analysis of chemotherapy
refusal also provides a unique contribution to the existing
literature. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, the current study cohort spanning through 2008 is among the
first to capture practice trends reflective of multiagent
therapy using oxaliplatin and capecitabine.
The results of the current study do not offer explanations for the striking age discrepancies noted in the use of
adjuvant chemotherapy. Refusal rates did not explain the
steep gradient of chemotherapy receipt observed across
age groups, because analysis with and without patients

who refused yielded comparable results. It is important to
recognize that in some circumstances, withholding adjuvant chemotherapy from elderly patients may be appropriate. Older patients experience surgical complications
more often than younger patients21 and suboptimal recovery after complications adversely affects performance
status, making these patients poorer candidates for chemotherapy. Using a physician survey, Ayanian et al22 found
that patient refusal or comorbid illness are implicated in
approximately 50% of cases of withheld chemotherapy in
patients aged > 75 years with stage III colon cancer or
stage II/III rectal cancer. In their study, comorbidity did
not account for the decrease in chemotherapy use by age
because this trend was significant in patients without
comorbidities. Physicians indicated that chemotherapy
was not clinically indicated in 27% of patients aged > 85
years, which indicates that chemotherapy is most likely
discussed with many patients in this age group.22 The etiology of age-based disparities in the receipt of chemotherapy is undoubtedly multifactorial.
We report several limitations inherent to the database used in the current study. First, given its retrospective
nature and lack of random assignment, we do not view
the results as practice-changing. Instead, we believe the
results of the current study add to the body of hypothesisdriven and hypothesis-generating evidence supporting
future prospective studies. Second, the CCR does not collect information concerning comorbidities and performance status, both of which weigh heavily on treatment
decisions in older patients. Prior work with CCR-linked
data confirms that older patients with colon cancer who
undergo surgical resection do have more comorbidities.23
Because the CCR does not collect comorbidity data, the
current study results may have overestimated the effect of
age on chemotherapy receipt and its survival benefit.
Third, the CCR does not collect information regarding
specific chemotherapy regimens, durations, compliance,
or referral to medical oncologists. Finally, current practice
in California may not reflect other regions of the United
States or the world. Nevertheless, given that the majority
of cancer trials enroll younger, healthier persons, our
cohort of patients aged > 75 years treated in actual practice compliments the results of phase 3 studies.
The current study has several implications. First,
age-specific toxicity profiles and side effects combined
with increasing comorbidities and decreased tolerance
likely inform the decreased odds of older patients receiving chemotherapy. Certainly, the decision to offer chemotherapy is informed by multiple factors that extend well
beyond the HR. Many factors not captured within admin402

istrative databases weigh heavily in these decisions (eg,
quality of life, estimated years of life gained, and increased
incidence/severity of toxicities). The inclusion of measures that shape clinical decision-making (eg, comorbidities and life expectancy) would greatly enhance the
usefulness of administrative databases such as the CCR.
Although the inclusion of such variables and geriatric
assessments of functional status and comorbidities in cancer registries would strengthen their usefulness, the definitive step to elucidating these complex relations is phase 2
and 3 studies in these patients. This evidence can provide
patients with effective and resource-conserving, rather
than maximally tolerated, treatments. Alternatively, consideration should be given to enrolling more patients or
stratifying patients by age > 75 years in future clinical trials. Second, the hypotheses examined in this analysis are
relevant to other solid organ malignancies such as cancers
of the breast, lung, and pancreas.24 Finally, although the
majority of recommendations limit colorectal cancer
screening to individuals aged  75 years,25 the results of
the current study indicate that patients aged > 75 years
represent nearly 20% of cases with lymph node-positive
colon cancer. Given the projected growth of this population and the potential benefits of chemotherapy, future
policies examining the feasibility of cancer screening in
the oldest old will have to be weighed against cost-effectiveness and life expectancy.
In conclusion, in this large population-based study,
we found that older age was associated with much lower
rates of adjuvant chemotherapy administration, whereas
the survival benefits of such treatment remain comparable
to those of younger patients with stage III colon cancer.
The effect of age as a predictor of receipt of chemotherapy
was much larger in magnitude than the effect of other predictors. Our findings support the survival benefits of
chemotherapy for elderly patients with colon cancer, call
for future studies to identify barriers to receipt of chemotherapy, and support the need to increase the participation
of geriatric patients in randomized trials.
