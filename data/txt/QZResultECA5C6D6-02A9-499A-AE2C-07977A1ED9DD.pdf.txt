BACKGROUND: African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer than whites and
have shorter survival once they are diagnosed. In this analysis, the authors examined racial differences in clinical outcomes among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who received bevacizumab. METHODS: The study
cohort consisted of 1589 white patients (81.4%) and 227 African American patients (11.6%) with mCRC who received
front-line bevacizumab therapy and who were enrolled in a large, predominantly community-based, prospective,
observational cohort study. Differences in time-to-event endpoints and response rates were examined by race. Differences in the incidence of baseline and treatment-related toxicities associated with bevacizumab also were examined.
Finally, differences in patterns of care by race were explored. RESULTS: The median overall survival was 22.6 months
for African Americans and 22.9 months for whites, and the median progression-free survival was 9.5 months for African Americans and 9.8 months for whites. Response rates (complete responses plus partial responses) were 37.5%
for African Americans and 46.3% for whites (adjusted odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.90). African
Americans had higher rates of baseline diabetes (18.9% vs 11%; P ¼ .002), higher rates of hypertension (52.9% vs
41.4%; P ¼ .001), and worsening hypertension while on therapy (13.7% vs 8.9%; P ¼ .02), but no differences in on-treatment arterial thromboembolic events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This large observational cohort study of
patients with mCRC demonstrated that, when treated in a similar fashion with modern chemotherapy, African Americans and whites had equivalent cancer outcomes. No significant differences in bevacizumab-related toxicity or patterns of care were observed between African Americans and whites. The lower response rate among African

INTRODUCTION
It is well established that African Americans with colon and rectal cancer have both a higher incidence and poorer overall
survival compared with whites and that this survival disparity actually is growing.1-3 Much of this disparity is attributed to
differences in stage at diagnosis4; however, even when analyses are controlled for disease stage at diagnosis, survival disparities persist and are worsening over time.
The driving factors for this increased stage-specific survival disparity are unclear. There are several potential explanations, including lower rates or quality of treatment for African American patients during a time when the availability of
curative therapy options was increasing; higher rates of baseline comorbidities, which lead to poorer overall survival; or differences in underlying tumor biology, which lead to lower survival rates for African American patients.5-12 Evaluations of
the clinical trial data consistently indicate no differences in cancer-specific survival by race but, in certain trials, do reveal
overall survival differences, suggesting that baseline comorbidities may be important.5,13-15
The baseline comorbidity differences between African Americans and whites may be particularly important with
bevacizumab, which is known to cause increases in the rates of hypertension and arterial thromboembolic events.16 Given
the demonstrated efficacy of bevacizumab in the front-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer,17 it will be

particularly important to explore racial differences in outcomes among patients who receive bevacizumab in the
front-line metastatic setting given the higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors among African Americans.18-21 In
this report, we present results from the Bevacizumab Regimens: Investigation of Treatment Effects and Safety
(BRiTE) study, an observational study that, as described
below, provides data that overcome many of the limitations described above.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Details
Details of the BRiTE registry have been published previously; however, in brief, BRiTE is a large, US-based, prospective, observational cohort study that was conducted at
248 study sites in 49 states.22 Also, 98% of patients in the
study were from community-based versus academic medical practices. Patients were able to participate if they met
the following criteria: previously untreated metastatic
colorectal cancer, treatment with bevacizumab as first-line
therapy, and signed informed consent. There were no specific exclusion criteria. Patients were considered on study
until death, withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow-up.
There were no protocol-specified treatments or assessments. All aspects of patients’ treatments over time,
including specific chemotherapy agents and/or combinations and the dose, schedule, and duration of bevacizumab
treatment, were determined by the patient’s physician.
Occurrences of adverse events were reported by each
patient’s physician. Data were collected at baseline and
every 3 months through a web-based electronic datacollection system. Total dropout or loss to follow-up was
12% (235 patients) and was similar between African
Americans and whites (10.6% vs 11.6%, respectively).
Clinical Outcomes and Measures
Measures of clinical outcomes were based on physician
determination and included the time to progression from
the date first-line treatment was initiated (progressionfree survival [PFS]); survival from the date of initiation of
first-line treatment to death (overall survival [OS]); and
survival beyond first progression (SBP), which was measured only for patients who had reported first progression
(progressive disease [PD]) and was calculated from the
date of first PD to death. Patients who had not died were
censored at study termination (because of loss to followup, patient’s decision, investigator’s decision, or sponsor’s
decision) or at the study end (July 30, 2008). The best

1084

first-line tumor response and PFS were analyzed according to investigator determination, including the imaging
method and interval.
Collaboration of data on baseline comorbidities and
on-treatment adverse events in BRiTE were focused on
previously described, bevacizumab-related adverse
events.17 Baseline comorbidities included arterial disease
history (history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, angina, and peripheral artery disease),
diabetes requiring medication, and hypertension requiring medication. On-study adverse events included arterial
thromboembolic events, venous thromboembolic events,
new or worsening hypertension (defined as an increase in
dose of or the addition of new hypertensive medications
for those already on therapy or the initiation of hypertensive medication for those without a previous history), gastrointestinal (GI) perforation, and grade 3 or 4 bleeding.
Statistical Analyses
PFS, OS, and SBP were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier
method, and comparisons by race (based on patient selfidentification) were analyzed using the log-rank test. A
Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the independent effects of race on time-to-event endpoints,
adjusting for the following factors in the multivariate
models: age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status, any prior adjuvant therapy, hypertension requiring medication at baseline, arterial disease history at baseline, diabetes mellitus requiring medication at
baseline, and disease-free interval (measured from the date
of initial colorectal cancer diagnosis). Response rates were
compared using the chi-square test and a logistic regression model with the inclusion of the same factors specified
above for the multivariate analysis and also with the addition of the type of front-line chemotherapy received. PFS
and response rates were analyzed further using a randomeffects Cox model and a mixed logistic regression model,
respectively, to adjust for site effects (physician information was not available) on patient disease status assessment. All other comparisons by race were analyzed in
fashion similar to that used for response rate assessment
described above.

African Americans were slightly less likely to receive frontline oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and folinic acid (FOLFOX),
capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX), or fluorouracil, leucovorin and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) with bevacizumab (72%
vs 75%), but this difference was not statistically significant
(P ¼ .25) (Table 2). African American patients were as likely
as white patients to receive therapy postprogression, including an equal likelihood of receiving all 3 types of active cytotoxic chemotherapy agents (fluropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, or
irinotecan), epidermal growth factor receptor-based therapy
postprogression, and bevacizumab postprogression. African
Americans and whites had similar median duration of total

use (11.2 months vs 11.1 months, respectively; P ¼ .91).
African Americans also were as likely as whites to undergo
hepatic metastatectomy after enrollment in the study (5.7%
vs 5.5%, respectively).
Clinical Outcomes
There were no differences between African Americans and
whites in OS (22.6 months vs 22.9 months; P ¼ .83), PFS
(9.3 months vs 9.7 months; P ¼ .15), or SBP (13.2 months
vs 12 months; P ¼ .63) (Table 3; Figs. 1 and 2). Unadjusted hazard ratios for OS and SBP were near 1.0; whereas,
for PFS, there was a statistically nonsignificant 11% greater
failure risk for African Americans (Table 3). These similar
outcomes persisted when other patient and disease characteristics were adjusted for in the multivariate hazard models
(Table 3). Furthermore, a random-effects Cox model that
adjusted for the correlation of patient PFS assessments
within a site yielded the same PFS results.
African Americans did have a lower objective response
rate to first-line therapy (39.2% vs 49.2%; P ¼ .043), which

1086

remained statistically significant after covariate adjustment
that included the type of primary chemotherapy (odds ratio
[OR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.90). Similar results (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.91) were obtained
from a mixed logistic regression model that adjusted for the
correlation among patient response assessments within a site.
On-Therapy Toxicity
Overall, African Americans and whites had similar rates of
bevacizumab-associated adverse events, including development of new hypertension, arterial thromboembolic
events, GI perforation, and bleeding (Table 4). However,
among those patients who had hypertension at baseline,
African Americans were more likely than whites to develop worsening hypertension while on therapy (13.7% vs
8.9%; OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.06-2.47).

DISCUSSION
Consistent with data from the colorectal clinical trial
literature, the current results indicate that, when similar
Cancer

therapy is given, racial differences in colorectal cancer survival are minimal to absent.5,13-15,23,24 The criticism of
studies based on clinical trial cohorts is that they represent
a highly selected cancer population that may not be representative of the general cancer population treated in the
community; their advantage is that treatment and followup data are standardized and rigorously collected. The
findings from clinical trial cohorts have differed from
those reported from many of the national and state registry database studies in which racial differences in survival
persist even after controlling for known patient and
tumor-related factors.1-3,25-32 Such registry-based studies
have the advantage of being population-based but suffer
from the lack of detailed, patient-specific treatment data.
The strength of the current analysis from BRiTE is that it
likely includes a somewhat less highly selected population
than a clinical trial study as a result of its minimal eligibility criteria and physician-determined treatment regimen
while, at the same time, prospectively collecting more
detailed patient treatment and toxicity information than
can be obtained in national and state registries. The current analysis also has the added advantage of including

more detailed information on relevant baseline comorbidities and follow-up treatment information than is typically
included in either clinical trial or registry studies. This last
point is particularly relevant for metastatic colorectal cancer, because it has been demonstrated that exposure to all
active chemotherapeutic agents is associated significantly
with OS.33
This also is the first study to our knowledge that has
explicitly explored the toxicity of bevacizumab among
African American patients. This is highly relevant given
the higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, such
as diabetes and hypertension, among African Americans
compared with whites.18-21 African American patients
could be at higher risk for arterial events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, which have known associations
with bevacizumab therapy.16 The absence of higher rates
of arterial thromboembolic events in the current study
among African Americans compared with whites despite a
higher prevalence of baseline hypertension and diabetes
among African American patients in this study is encouraging. It also should be noted that the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in our cohort is consistent with that

observed in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, suggesting a lack of significant selection bias in this cohort observational study.19,20
The cardiovascular event of developing worsening hypertension observed during our study period was higher
among African Americans. We explored the possibility
that African Americans received bevacizumab for a shorter
duration, but no differences in the median duration of
first-line or total bevacizumab doses were observed (data
not shown). Whether this worsening hypertension among
African Americans compared with whites was directly
related to bevacizumab therapy or would have occurred
even in the absence of such therapy cannot be answered by
this study, because there was no control group of patients
who did not receive bevacizumab.
Although it was not designed as a study to evaluate
the use of different treatment modalities in the community, given the considerable discretion afforded a patient’s
oncologist in terms of the backbone chemotherapy regimen used and the choice of whether to proceed with therapy beyond first progression, the current study does
afford the opportunity to determine whether there are differences in treatment by race among community oncologists. Again, it is encouraging to note that there do not
appear to be any significant differences in treatment. An
important caveat is that this database did not allow for
direct calculation of dose intensity or density by race, and
these variables reportedly differ in the breast cancer literature.34 We are comforted by the finding that, if there was
under dosing by race (lower dose density or intensity for
African Americans), then this probably would bias the
results away from the findings in this study of no difference, and controlling for dose intensity would have made
our findings even more robust.
Although no significant racial differences in OS or
PFS were observed in this study, African Americans did
have a lower response rate to therapy. This is consistent
with the results reported by Sanoff et al in the N9741
analysis.5 A second finding noted in the N9741 analysis
and in a previously published analysis of a GI Intergroup
adjuvant stage II and III study (INT 0089) was that African Americans had lower rates of GI toxicity than
whites.23 This raises the question of whether a certain subset of African American patients actually may benefit
from higher doses of chemotherapy. Our current state of
knowledge regarding pharmacogenomic differences by
race for the chemotherapeutic agents used in colorectal
cancer is limited. One study has suggested that African
Americans have higher rates of dihydropyrimidine dehy-

1088

drogenase deficiency compared with whites,35 which may
lead to more frequent dose reductions of 5-fluorouracil
for African American patients. Another study has suggested possible differences between African Americans
and whites in alleles of unknown significance in the
enhancer region that controls thymidylate synthase
expression, which theoretically may lead to tumor resistance to 5-fluorouracil.36 Several other pharmacogenomic
variants by race for 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin were noted in the N9741 analysis discussed above.5
It will be important to explore whether this difference in
the response rate is confirmed in ongoing randomized trials for metastatic colorectal cancer, because this may have
implications for the treatment of patients with suspected
micrometastatic disease in the adjuvant setting, in which
complete eradication of these micrometastases is the goal.
An important caveat to our findings regarding
response rates and PFS is that tumor response and progression were physician determined, were not required to
be assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors, and did not undergo central review, as is
often done in a clinical trial. We attempted to compensate
for this in our models by controlling for the practice site
where a patient was treated; however, if there were differences within a site in when and how response rates and
progression were characterized for African American versus white patients, then the modeling used would not
compensate for these differences.
There are several additional limitations to the
current study. First, although eligibility criteria and treatment requirements were very flexible for this observational cohort study, a basic requirement was that all patients
had to be started on front-line bevacizumab therapy.
Oncologists, who are well aware of the cardiovascular risks
associated with bevacizumab, likely would not start such
therapy on patients deemed at high risk for such events. It
is also possible that oncologists were even more selective
in placing their African American patients on bevacizumab given the higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in this group. This introduces a selection bias that
limits the external validity of the study. This concern is
somewhat countered by noting that the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in this study were in line with
national prevalence estimates by race. The median age of
63.5 years for the patients in this study also was younger
than the general population of patients with metastatic colon cancer, especially among whites, in which 60% of
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are aged 65
years. The median age of 61.7 years for African Americans

Cancer

February 15, 2012

was more in line with registry data, which reflect that 50%
of patients are aged <65 years.2
A second limitation of this study is that no socioeconomic data, such as insurance status, were collected. To
the extent that oncologists are more likely to initiate highcost therapies like bevacizumab only in patients who have
adequate insurance, the current analysis will not be representative of the general colon cancer population and could
introduce a more significant bias for African Americans,
who have higher rates of noninsurance coverage than
whites.37 The significance that this potential bias has on
the findings of this study is not clear. In a meta-analysis of
studies with adjustments for socioeconomic status that
examined differences in cancer-specific survival and OS
between African Americans and whites with colorectal
cancer, Du et al observed that African Americans continued to have a 14% increase in the hazard of all-cause mortality and a 13% increase in colon cancer mortality.32 In
the National Cancer Institute’s Black and White Cancer
Survival Study, which included in-person interviews to
collect detailed sociodemographic information on each
patient, African Americans were 50% more likely to die
from colon cancer than whites.4 When stage was included
in the model, the relative mortality excess decreased to
20%. However, the inclusion of individual sociodemographic variables (education, poverty index, marital status,
occupation, source of care, type of insurance) in the model
did not alter the mortality excess, which remained 20%.
This suggests that the sociodemographic effect may be
mediated through disease stage at diagnosis but does not
exert additional influence on survival once stage is taken
into consideration.
In conclusion, this large observational cohort study
of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who received
bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in the first-line setting
demonstrates that, when patients are treated in a similar
fashion with modern chemotherapy, African Americans
and whites have equivalent clinical outcomes. This suggests
that differences in treatment received may be driving the
disparities observed in population-based epidemiologic
data. It is encouraging that we observed no significant differences in bevacizumab-related toxicity or patterns of care
between African Americans and whites in this primarily
community-based study. The lower response rate among
African Americans despite similar therapy confirms previous findings and deserves further study.
