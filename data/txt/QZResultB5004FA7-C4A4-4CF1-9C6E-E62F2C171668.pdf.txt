ABSTRACT
Cathepsin B is a ubiquitously expressed lysosomal cysteine protease that
participates in protein turnover within lysosomes. However, its protein and activity
levels have been shown to be increased in cancer. Cathepsin B endopeptidase activity
is involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix, a process that promotes tumor
invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. Previously, we reported an established
antibiotic nitroxoline as a potent and selective inhibitor of cathepsin B. In the present
study, we elucidated its anti-tumor properties in in vitro and in vivo tumor models.
Tumor and endothelial cell lines with high levels of active cathepsin B were
selected for functional analysis of nitroxoline in vitro. Nitroxoline significantly reduced
extracellular DQ-collagen IV degradation by all evaluated cancer cell lines using
spectrofluorimetry. Nitroxoline also markedly decreased tumor cell invasion monitored
in real time and reduced the invasive growth of multicellular tumor spheroids, used
as a 3D in vitro model of tumor invasion. Additionally, endothelial tube formation
was significantly reduced by nitroxoline in an in vitro angiogenesis assay. Finally,
nitroxoline significantly abrogated tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis in
vivo in LPB fibrosarcoma and MMTV-PyMT breast cancer mouse models. Overall, our
results designate nitroxoline as a promising drug candidate for anti-cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION

access of extended substrates to the primed sites of the
active-site cleft [1]. The His110-His111 pair is located at
the tip of the occluding loop and acts as an anchor for
the substrate’s C-terminal carboxylate. This enables the
exopeptidase activity with a pH optimum around 5, which
is typical for lysosomal compartments [2, 3]. However,
the loop is flexible and removal of the contacts that bind it
to the enzyme body markedly increases the endopeptidase
activity. The endopeptidase conformation of the
occluding loop is stable at neutral pH [4, 5], suggesting an

Cathepsin B (CatB; EC 3.4.22.1) is a lysosomal
cysteine protease that belongs to the papain family (C1)
of clan CA of cysteine proteases. The enzyme possesses
endopeptidase and dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity.
This dual character is attributed to the presence of a 20
amino acid insertion termed the occluding loop. In the
exopeptidase conformation, two salt bridges bind the
loop to the body of the enzyme, in this way limiting the

endopeptidase activity for CatB in the extralysosomal and
extracellular environment.
CatB primarily partakes in protein turnover in
lysosomes; however, its physiological roles were recently
extended to more specific functions. Alterations in its
expression, protein levels, activity and localization are
associated with several diseases, including cancer [6–8].
Intracellular and extracellular CatB were shown to degrade
several proteins of the extracellular matrix – collagen
type IV, laminin and fibronectin and activate proteases
acting downstream in a proteolytic cascade resulting in
extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, tumor invasion
and metastasis [9–13].
The active role of CatB in malignant progression
was demonstrated in various tumor mouse models
using CatB-deficient mice [14, 15]. Given the high
pharmacological relevance of CatB in cancer, searching
for new selective inhibitors became a challenge for
medicinal chemists and pharmaceutical companies [16,
17]. The majority of synthetic inhibitors of CatB have
peptidyl backbones with an electrophilic reactive group
that forms either a reversible or an irreversible covalent
bond with the active site cysteine. However, none of
the existing CatB inhibitors are used in clinical practice
due to poor bioavailability, off-target side effects and
high toxicity [18]. Recently, we identified nitroxoline
(5-nitro-8-hydroxyquinoline) as a potent, selective
and reversible inhibitor of CatB [19]. Nitroxoline is an
established drug for treatment of urinary tract infections
and as such it displays superior pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic characteristics over existing CatB
inhibitors. Independently, nitroxoline was also found
to induce senescence of endothelial cells by inhibiting
type 2 methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP2) and sirtuin
(SIRT1) [20] and to induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis
in glioma cells [21].
In the current study we evaluated nitroxoline’s
potential to impair tumor-promoting processes that
depend on the endopeptidase activity of CatB. We
demonstrate that inhibition of CatB endopeptidase activity
by nitroxoline significantly reduces degradation of ECM
and consequently the invasion of selected tumor cells in
two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) models.
Nitroxoline also impairs endothelial cell tube formation
and significantly abrogates tumor growth and metastasis
formation in vivo. These results encourage further preclinical and clinical studies to validate the potential of
nitroxoline and its derivatives as promising antitumor
drugs.

CatB protein and activity levels
The cell lines selected for in vitro evaluation of
tumor cell invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis were of
either human (MCF-10A neoT, U-87 MG, HUVEC and
HMEC-1) or mouse (MMTV-PyMT, LPB and SVEC410) origin and comprised a variety of cancer types
(transformed breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A neoT,
mammary carcinoma cell line MMTV-PyMT, glioma
cell line U-87 MG and sarcoma cell line LPB) as well
as a variety of vascular cell lines of different origins
(microvascular endothelial cell line HMEC-1 and vein
endothelial cell lines HUVEC and SVEC4-10). Our first
objective was to determine the CatB protein and activity
levels associated with these cell lines.
All cell lines were shown to contain a significant
amount of CatB within the cell (Table 1) and bound to
the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane (Fig.
1A) using CatB-specific ELISA and flow cytometry.
Association of CatB with the plasma membrane was also
confirmed with confocal microscopy (Supplementary Fig.
1). In addition, secreted CatB was observed for all cell
lines apart from SVEC4-10 (Table 1). CatB protein and
activity levels in cell lysates were significantly higher
than those in conditioned media for all cell lines tested.
In line with previous reports [22–24], human transformed
and tumor cell lines, MCF-10A neoT and U-87 MG,
had higher levels of intracellular and plasma membrane
bound CatB than non-tumor vascular endothelial cell lines
(p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively) (Table 1 and Fig. 1A).
However, this trend was not apparent in the murine cell
lines.
CatB
substrate
Z-Arg-Arg-7-amino-4methylcoumarin (AMC) was used to establish that CatB,
regardless of its location, is proteolytically active (Table
1). Similar trends in CatB activity were observed as with
CatB protein levels, i.e. levels of CatB activity in human
transformed and cancer cell lines were higher than in
human vascular endothelial cell lines (p < 0.001) and
higher in human than in murine cell lines (p < 0.001).
Irreversible CatB-selective inhibitor CA-074 (10 µM) [25]
and nitroxoline (100 µM) inhibited the release of AMC in
whole cell lysates and in conditioned media in all cell lines
evaluated by ~100 and ~30%, respectively (Fig. 1B and
1C). Additionally, a half maximal effective concentration
(EC50) was determined for nitroxoline inhibition of CatB
activity in MCF-10A neoT whole cell lysates (162.2
µM; Fig. 1D). Taken altogether, these results validated
the selected cell lines as suitable in vitro invasion and
angiogenesis cell-based models for evaluation of CatB
inhibitors.

of MCF-10A neoT cells with nitroxoline (50 µM) or CA074Me (50 µM), a cell-permeable CatB inhibitor, reduced
intracellular DQ-collagen IV degradation by ~50 and

the acidification of lysosomes, reduced intracellular DQcollagen IV degradation by ~40%, suggesting that the
degradation occurs within lysosomes and is dependent
on lysosomal proteases. CA-074Me and bafilomycin A1,
but not nitroxoline, inhibited intracellular collagen IV
degradation in the U-87 MG glioma cell line by 10 and
11%, respectively (Fig. 2C). When murine MMTV-PyMT
and LPB cell lines were evaluated, only bafilomycin A1
reduced intracellular DQ-collagen IV degradation, by 12
and 6% respectively, whereas no decrease was observed
with nitroxoline or CA-074Me (Fig. 2C).
On the other hand, when collagen IV degradation
was monitored in the extracellular milieu, far greater
inhibition was evident. Nitroxoline (5 µM) and CA074 (5 µM) inhibited extracellular DQ-collagen IV
degradation in all tested cell lines (Fig. 2D). This was
further corroborated by nitroxoline EC50 values (16.8 and
0.239 µM, respectively) for inhibition of intracellular and
extracellular DQ-collagen IV degradation by MCF-10A
neoT cells (Fig. 2E and 2F).

and ELISA, confirming that nitroxoline impairs tumor cell
invasion by CatB inhibition.

Nitroxoline inhibits the growth of multicellular
tumor spheroids in a 3D in vitro tumor invasion
assay
An in vitro invasion model based on implantation of
multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) in ECM-mimicking
matrices was used to assess the ability of nitroxoline to
impair tumor cell invasion in a 3D setting [26]. Cell
numbers and time of incubation needed for the preparation
of MCTS of reproducible shape and size were optimized
for each cell line individually (Supplementary Fig. 7).
MCTS were implanted in Matrigel and their growth
monitored for three days (Fig. 3B). Representative images
were recorded at day 2 (U-87 MG) or day 3 (MCF-10A
neoT, MMTV-PyMT and LPB) (Fig. 3C). Cells at the
border of the MCF-10A neoT, U-87 MG and MMTVPyMT MCTS formed multicellular, radially invading
strands, creating a sunburst pattern around the original
spheroid. In addition to collective invasion, individual
cells were also observed migrating away from the original
MCTS (Supplementary Fig. 8). Of the four cell lines used
only LPB MCTS were without an invasive corona, but
they nevertheless retained the individual cell invasive
pattern (Fig. 3C). Abundant CatB proteolytic activity
was observed in cells located in the core as well as at
the protrusive edges of MCTS, using the CatB-selective
activity probe cresyl violet-(Arg-Arg)2 (Magic RedTM)
(Fig. 3D).
Incubation of MCF-10A neoT and MMTV-PyMT
MCTS with nitroxoline (2.5 or 5 µM) or CA-074 (5
µM) reduced the spheroid growth (Fig. 3B) as well as
the formation of invasive protrusions at the edge of
MCTS (Fig. 3C). In addition, fewer cells were observed
migrating away from the original spheroid after treatment
with nitroxoline (Fig. 3C). A less pronounced impact
was observed with U-87 MG MCTS, where significant
inhibition of MCTS growth was observed at day 2
with reduced, albeit not significant, inhibition at day 3.
However, as before, nitroxoline or CA-074 reduced corona
sprouting and migration of individual cells. Nitroxoline
or CA-074 failed to inhibit spheroid growth with LPB
MCTS, but fewer cells migrated away from the original
spheroid after treatment with nitroxoline (Fig. 3C).

Nitroxoline impairs in vitro tumor cell invasion in
real time
To confirm the involvement of CatB in the invasion
of the transformed and cancer cells small interfering
RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing was performed. CatB
knockdown reduced invasion of all cell lines when
compared to cells transfected with control siRNA, thus
validating CatB as a tumor cell invasion-promoting
protease (Fig. 3A). To verify the silencing, transfected
cells were evaluated for CatB protein levels and activity
at 24, 48 and 72h after the transfection (Supplementary
Fig. 3 and 4).
Next, we evaluated the ability of nitroxoline
to impair tumor cell invasion in real time using the
xCELLigence System. As shown in Fig. 3A, nitroxoline
(2.5 or 5 µM) reduced cell invasion in all the cell lines (5493%), with the largest decrease in LPB cells. Similarly,
CA-074 (5 µM) reduced invasion of all cell lines evaluated
(47-68 %).
To exclude the possibility that the inhibition of
tumor invasion resulted from the compound-induced cell
toxicity, cell viability was assayed using the xCELLigence
system. Neither nitroxoline (2.5 or 5 µM) nor CA-074 (5
µM) reduced the viability of cells at concentrations and
times used for the invasion experiment (Supplementary
Fig. 5).
Additionally, to explore the probability that
nitroxoline decreased tumor cell invasion by reducing
CatB expression, CatB protein levels were evaluated
in cell lysates following treatment with nitroxoline. As
depicted in Supplementary Fig. 6, nitroxoline (2.5 or 5
µM) did not significantly reduce CatB protein levels after
24, 48 and 72 h treatment as analyzed with western blot

correlate with the capacity of endothelial cells to form new
vessels. Nitroxoline (10 µM) reduced tube formation of
HMEC-1 and SVEC4-10 cells as evident from increased
numbers of tubular complexes, but not of HUVEC cells
(Fig. 4A and 4B). Inhibitors of CatB, MetAP2 and SIRT1,
CA-074 (10 µM), TNP-470 (10 nM) and EX-527 (1 µM),
alone did not change the number of tubular complexes
in all tested endothelial cell lines (Fig. 4B). Additional
analysis of binary masks of tubular networks showed
that nitroxoline also caused a reduction in the length of
tubular complexes and in the numbers of their junctions
in HUVEC, HMEC-1 and SVEC4-10 cells, without
reducing their size. CA-074 also decreased the length of
tubular complexes in HUVEC and HMEC-1 cell lines
and the number of junctions in HMEC-1 cell line, but did
not impair SVEC4-10 endothelial cell tube formation.

TNP-470 failed to reduce the length and size of tubular
complexes or the number of their junctions in any of the
cell lines tested, whereas EX-527 did not impair HUVEC
or SVEC4-10 endothelial tube formation, but reduced the
complex length and the number of junctions of HMEC-1
cell line.

Nitroxoline abrogates tumor growth in vivo
LPB fibrosarcoma cells were implanted in C57Bl/6
mice and nitroxoline (40 mg/kg) was administered in
their drinking water for the entire duration of experiment
or for 15 days only. As control, CA-074 (10 mg/kg) was
administered intraperitoneally every second day, alone
or in combination with nitroxoline in drinking water.

increased the time required for LPB tumors to reach a

difference in the time required for tumors to reach a volume of 40 mm3 between the experimental and control group. Data are presented as

volume of 40 mm3 (Fig. 5C and 5D) and caused a delay in
tumor growth (Fig. 5E and 5F). The reduced rate of tumor
growth was observed at the transition of tumors from the
avascular to the vascular phase of growth. Administration
of CA-074 and nitroxoline in combination did not result
in further reduction of tumor growth (Fig. 5B). When
nitroxoline was withdrawn after 15 days of treatment, the
nitroxoline-induced inhibition of tumor growth ceased
(Fig. 5A).
An orthotopic mouse breast cancer model was also
employed in which primary MMTV-PyMT cells were
injected into the left inguinal mammary gland of FVB/N
congenic recipient mice. Nitroxoline (40 mg/kg) treatment
of these mice reduced the growth of induced tumors (Fig.
6A). Neovascularization in treated tumors was examined
by immunohistochemical staining for CD31+ endothelial
cells. As shown in Fig. 6B nitroxoline impaired
neovascularization of induced tumors and images obtained
resembled the results from the in vitro tube formation
assay, where increase in the number of tubular complexes
was observed (Fig. 4).
The effect of nitroxoline (40 mg/kg) on the
metastatic process was examined using the transgenic
PyMT mouse model that spontaneously develops
numerous mammary tumors and lung metastases [27].
Since the large number of spontaneously forming tumors
prevented monitoring of the tumor volumes by palpation
and Vernier caliper, the tumors were weighed at the end
of the experiment. The weight of tumors at week 14
following nitroxoline treatment was significantly lower
than that of tumors from untreated animals (Fig. 6C).
Furthermore, in the nitroxoline-treated PyMT mice the
number of lung metastases as well as their average size
were reduced (Fig. 6D).
Nitroxoline did not induce any systemic toxicity as
judged by monitoring the body weight of mice in all three
in vivo tumor models (data not shown).

CatB activity in cell lysates and conditioned media by
~30-40 and ~100%, respectively. The different degrees of
inhibition can be attributed to their mechanisms of action
– while CA-074 irreversibly inactivates the enzyme in
the nano-molar range [25], nitroxoline reversibly inhibits
CatB at low micro-molar concentration [19]. Irreversible
inhibitors may at higher doses and prolonged use cause
undesired effects due to off-target binding rendering them
inappropriate for therapy of chronic diseases [18]. Because
of this, reversible inhibitors, although less efficient, may
be superior to irreversible inhibitors.
We and others have shown that extracellular and
intracellular CatB activity is a prerequisite for ECM
turnover [10, 28, 29]. ECM provides an important physical
barrier against tumor invasion and its proteolysis mediated
by macrophages, tumor and endothelial cells creates
a pathway for tumor and endothelial cells to migrate
and invade the remodeled matrix [10–12, 30, 31]. All
evaluated transformed and cancer cell lines degraded DQcollagen IV intracellularly and extracellularly (Fig. 2A and
2B). Cell-permeable CatB inhibitor, CA-074Me, inhibited
intracellular ECM degradation in MCF-10A neoT and
U-87 MG cells but not in MMTV-PyMT and LPB-1 cells
(Fig. 2C). This suggests that while in MCF-10A neoT and
U-87 MG cells the intracellular ECM degradation is due,
at least in part, to CatB activity, in the MMTV-PyMT and
LPB-1 cell lines other proteases may be responsible for
the intracellular breakdown of ECM proteins. On the other
hand, CA-074 decreased the extracellular DQ-collagen
IV degradation in all four cell lines, validating CatB as
one of the key proteases involved in the extracellular
breakdown of ECM. In line with this, nitroxoline reduced
extracellular DQ-collagen IV degradation in all four cell
lines tested (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, lower EC50 values for
inhibition of extracellular versus intracellular DQ-collagen
IV degradation suggest that nitroxoline is more efficient at
inhibiting the extracellular rather than the intracellular arm
of the ECM breakdown.
CatB has been proposed as one of the key proteases
promoting tumor invasion. It was found equally relevant
for epithelial, mesenchymal and glioma cell invasion
that employ various migratory patterns, suggesting an
universal mechanism for CatB in these processes [10, 29,
32–38]. Accordingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown, CA074 and nitroxoline reduced tumor invasion as evaluated
by xCELLigence system in real time in all evaluated
cell lines (Fig. 3A). In addition to the 2D invasion assay,
nitroxoline and CA-074 both reduced growth, sprouting
and invasive cell migration in the 3D model of MCF10A neoT, MMTV-PyMT and to a lesser extent of U-87
MG MCTS (Fig. 3B and 3C). On the other hand, LPB
MCTS growth remained unaffected as they lacked the
invasive corona around the original spheroid. Increasing
literature reports show that in 3D spheroid models
cancer cells acquire alternative phenotypes compared
to monolayer cell culture due to increased cell-cell and

DISCUSSION
Nitroxoline, an established antibiotic for treating
urinary tract infections, has been shown to be a selective
and reversible inhibitor of CatB endopeptidase activity
which is involved in the degradation of ECM proteins [9,
10]. In this study we demonstrate that nitroxoline impairs
various processes of tumor progression by reducing CatB
activity in various in vitro assays using transformed and
cancer cell lines and in vivo in three different tumor mouse
models.
Our first aim was to select cell lines with appropriate
expression, activity and secretion of CatB to establish in
vitro invasion and angiogenesis models for evaluation of
the CatB inhibitors. Significant levels of proteolytically
active CatB were demonstrated in cell lysates, extracellular
milieu and on the cell surface of all selected cell lines
(Table 1 and Fig. 1A). Nitroxoline and CA-074 inhibited

cell-matrix interactions [39–41]. It is therefore possible
that in U-87 MG and LBP cells other mechanisms, in
addition to CatB, contribute to tumor invasion in the 3D
experimental set up thus accounting for a lesser impact of
nitroxoline on U-87 MG and LPB MCTS growth when
compared to the 2D invasion model. Taken altogether,
the xCELLigence and MCTS data demonstrate that by
impairing ECM degradation nitroxoline is able to reduce
tumor cell invasion in complex in vitro assays and indicate
its feasibility for further in vivo evaluation as an antitumor
agent.
The formation of tumor vasculature by angiogenesis
is essential for tumors to grow beyond 1-2 mm3. CatB
has been shown to promote angiogenesis by ECM
breakdown and its role in angiogenesis has been validated
in CatB knockout or overexpression mice [11, 15, 37–

39]. Additionally, intense CatB staining of endothelial
cells in glioblastomas correlated with poorer clinical
outcomes confirming its role in tumor angiogenesis and
suggesting its clinical application as a prognostic factor
[42]. Nitroxoline attenuated endothelial tube formation of
HMEC-1 and SVEC4-10 cells (Fig. 4). CA-074 displayed
the largest inhibition on HMEC-1 cell tube formation
which is in line with the CatB protein and activity levels
being the highest of the three endothelial cell lines (Table
1). A recent study by Shim et al. [20] has shown that
nitroxoline, through inhibition of MetAP2 and SIRT1,
is able to induce senescence of endothelial cells, thereby
inhibiting their proliferation and angiogenesis. For this
reason, we included TNP-470 and EX-527, the inhibitors
of MetAP2 and SIRT1, in our angiogenesis assay. TNP470 failed to impair endothelial tube formation in all

model. (A) MMTV-PyMT cells (5×105) were inoculated into the left inguinal mammary gland of the FVB/N congenic recipient mouse
and after tumor volumes reached 125 mm3, mice were treated with 40 mg/kg nitroxoline intraperitoneally every second day. Control group

three cell lines tested, similarly as observed by Shim et
al. [20] for HUVEC cells while EX-527 reduced tube
formation of HMEC-1 but not of HUVEC or SVEC4-10
cells. The discrepancy between the two studies can be
partially explained by differences in the experimental setup. Nevertheless, nitroxoline may attenuate endothelial
tube formation and angiogenesis by synergistic action on
MetAP2, SIRT1 and CatB.
Anti-tumorigenic effects of nitroxoline were further
evaluated in three independent tumor mouse models. Oral
administration of nitroxoline attenuated the growth of
LPB-induced tumors in C57Bl/6 mice (Fig. 5). Similar
results were obtained with intraperitoneally applied CA074. However, when nitroxoline and CA-074 were used in
combination no additional decrease in tumor growth was
observed, confirming that nitroxoline-mediated attenuation
of tumor growth was due to CatB inhibition. As evident
from tumor growth curves, nitroxoline treatment delayed
the transition of tumors from avascular to vascular stages
(Fig. 5A) confirming its anti-angiogenic properties.
Similar information was obtained in a FVB mouse
model. Nitroxoline reduced the growth of MMTV-PyMTinduced tumors and impaired neovascularization compared
to non-treated tumors (Fig. 6). Finally, when nitroxoline
was administrated to transgenic PyMT mice that
spontaneously form mammary carcinoma and metastases
in the lung, it reduced the weight of mammary tumors, the
number of metastases in the lung and their average size.
Taken altogether, these results show that nitroxoline not
only decreases tumor growth and angiogenesis but also
impairs metastasis by inhibiting CatB activity.
In conclusion, we show that nitroxoline attenuates
CatB-dependent extracellular ECM protein degradation
and in this way abrogates processes of tumor invasion
and angiogenesis in in vitro assays. Moreover, nitroxoline
significantly abrogates tumor growth, angiogenesis
and metastasis in various in vivo tumor mouse models
regardless of its route of administration. This, together
with its favorable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
properties and lack of systemic toxicity, renders
nitroxoline a new potential as anti-tumor drug that might
also be used in combination with other cancer standardsof-care.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Conditioned medium was obtained by incubating
the serum-free medium (SFM) with confluent cells for
24 h. Afterwards, media were concentrated and dialyzed
twice against 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.5). Whole-cell
lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES,
1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH
5.5). CatB protein levels were determined using ELISA
as reported [43]. CatB activity was evaluated using a
fluorogenic CatB endopeptidase substrate Z-Arg-ArgAMC at 460 nm with excitation at 380 nm.

Cell lines
MCF-10A neoT, a c-Ha-ras oncogene transfected
human breast epithelial cell line [40], and LPB
fibrosarcoma cell line [41], a clonal derivate of
methylcholanthrene-induced C57Bl/6 mouse sarcoma
tumor were provided by Bonnie F. Sloane (Wayne State
University, Detroit, MI) and Jean Jr. Belehradek (Institut
Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France), respectively. Primary
MMTV-PyMT mammary carcinoma cells were isolated
and cultured as described [42]. Human glioma cell line
U-87 MG, human umbilical vein endothelial cell line
HUVEC and SV40-transformed murine endothelial
cell line SVEC4-10 were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). These
cell lines were authenticated by ATCC using STR-PCR
and were used within 6 months upon receipt. Human
microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were obtained
from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta,
GA, USA). U-87 MG, MMTV-PyMT, HUVEC and
SVEC4-10 cells were cultured in Advanced Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; HyClone, Little Chalfont, UK), 2 mM glutamine
(Invitrogen) and antibiotics; LPB cells were cultured
in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM; Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine and
antibiotics; MCF-10A neoT cells were cultured in
DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium (Invitrogen) supplemented
with 5% FBS, 1 µg/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 µg/ml
hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 ng/ml EGF (SigmaAldrich), 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics; HMEC-1
cells were cultured in MCDB 131 medium (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10 ng/ml EGF, 1 µg/ml hydrocortisone,
10% FBS, 10 mM L-glutamine and antibiotics. All cell
lines were kept at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2.

goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 1h at
RT. Finally, cells were monitored for fluorescence using
a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, Franklin
Lakes, NJ).

MCF-10A neoT cells (3×104) were plated on
glass coverslips in a 24-well plate and left to adhere
overnight. Cells were transfected with 1µg/ml pPalmitoylmTurquoise2 plasmid (plasmid #36209, Addgene,
Cambridge, MA) [52] for visualization of the membrane
using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 5 % formalin
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at room temperature (RT)
and further permeabilized by 0.5 % Tween 20 in PBS for
10 min at RT. Non-specific staining was blocked with
3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h at RT
and afterwards incubated with 3 µg/ml rabbit anti-CatB
polyclonal antibody in blocking buffer for 1.5 h at RT.
Next, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with
Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(Invitrogen) for 1h at RT. After washing, a ProLong
Antifade kit (Invitrogen) was used to mount coverslips on
glass slides and the images were captured using a Zeiss
LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany) with ZEN 2011 image software.

DQ-collagen IV degradation
Quantification of intracellular and extracellular
DQ-collagen IV (Invitrogen) degradation as well as its
visualization were performed as reported [19].

Cell viability assay
Possible cytotoxicity of the selected compounds on
cell lines used in the invasion assays were evaluated using
the xCELLigence System (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
The system monitors cellular events in real time by
measuring the electrical impedance (expressed as cell
index) generated by cells attached to the bottom of wells
with integrated electrodes. 150 μl of MCF-10A neoT,
U-87 MG, MMTV-PyMT (5×104 cells/ml) and LPB
(3.3×104 cells/ml) cell suspension were seeded in the wells
of an E-plate 16 (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. After seeding, the CI was monitored every
15 min. After ~10 h (MCF-10A neoT and MMTV-PyMT),
14 h (U-87 MG) or 24 h (LPB), when the cells were in
their log phase of growth, 50 μl of the compound or 0.1%
DMSO was added, and the experiment allowed to run for
72 h. Once every 24 h the medium was replaced with fresh
medium containing the inhibitor or suitable control to
prevent cell death due to medium depletion. Compounds
and their concentrations were: nitroxoline (5 µM) and
CA-074 (5 µM) for all cell lines other than MCF-10A
neoT cell line, where nitroxoline was used at 2.5 µM. All
measurements were performed in quadruplicate.

Western blot analysis
Equal amounts of protein were loaded and
separated using 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred
to a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, Freiburg,
Germany). Membranes were blocked with 5 % (w/v) nonfat dried milk powder in PBST (0.5 % Tween 20 in PBS)
for 1 h at RT and afterwards incubated with sheep antiCatB (1:2500) and mouse anti-β-actin (1:5000; SigmaAldrich) antibodies overnight at 4°C. Next, membranes
were washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated rabbit
anti-sheep secondary antibodies (1:3000) and goat antimouse IgG/IgM (1:1000; Millipore, Billerica, MA)
antibodies 1h at RT for CatB and β-actin, respectively.
Finally, membranes were washed and bands were
visualized using SuperSignal West Dura Extended
Duration Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) or
SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate
(Thermo Scientific) chemiluminiscence kit for CatB and
β-actin, respectively using G:Box (Syngene, Cambrige,
UK). Membranes were stripped with stripping buffer
(100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS and 62.5 mM TrisHCl, pH 5.7) for 1h at 60°C. The band intensities were
quantified using Gene Tools software (Syngene).

Real time invasion assay
Tumor-cell invasion in real time were determined
using the xCELLigence System as before [30]. Cells
were serum-starved for 24 h before each experiment and
the bottoms of CIM-16 plate wells (Roche) were coated
with fibronectin (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany). The
upper compartments of the plate wells were coated with
20 μl of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in SFM (5 mg/ml) and
allowed to gel. After addition of 180 μl complete medium
containing nitroxoline (2.5 or 5 µM), CA-074 (5 µM) or
suitable control (0.05% DMSO) to lower compartments
the plates were assembled and 60 μl of SFM with the
compounds were added to the top wells. Afterwards, 80
μl of MCF-10A neoT, U-87 MG, MMTV-PyMT (3×104
cells∕well) and LPB (8×104 cells∕well) cell suspension were
seeded in the top chambers. Impedance data, reported
as cell index, was monitored for 72 h and the data were

analyzed using the RTCA Software (Roche). For CatB
silencing, cells were transfected with human (sc-29238;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX or SI02663010;
Qiagen, Limburg, Netherlands) or mouse CatB (sc-29933;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control siRNA (sc-37007;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 6 h before the experiment,
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.

Animal studies were carried out in accordance with
EU guidelines and the permission from the Veterinary
Administration of the Republic of Slovenia (permission
number: #34401/42/2011/3 and #34401/15/2011/9). Mice
were housed in a specific-pathogen-free animal colony at
controlled temperature and humidity with 12h light/dark
cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum.

Three-dimensional invasion assay

LPB mouse fibrosarcoma tumor model

MCTS were prepared according to the hangingdrop method as before [44]. Formed MCTS were then
transferred to wells of Lab-Tek™ Chambered Coverglass
which had been coated with 70 μl of Matrigel (5 mg/ml)
in SFM. Spheroids were covered with an additional 70 μl
of Matrigel (5 mg/ml) in SFM and, after 20 min at 37°C,
covered with 400 μl of complete medium. Nitroxoline (2.5
or 5 µM), CA-074 (5 µM), CA-074Me (5 µM) or DMSO
(0.05 %) were added to the Matrigel and the medium
and the growth of spheroids was monitored for up to
three days by measuring the spheroid dimensions under
a light microscope, using an ocular micrometer. Spheroid
volume was calculated according to the equation: V = (π
× (spheroid length) × (spheroid width)2)/6. In a separate
experiment, CatB activity was assayed using a Magic
RedTM Cathepsin B Assay Kit according to manufacturer’s
instructions
(Immunochemistry
Technologies,
Bloomington, MN). Images of tumor spheroids were
obtained using an Olympus IX 81 motorized inverted
microscope and Cell^R software (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan).

Experiments were performed in C57Bl/6 female
mice, 8 – 12 weeks old. 1.2×106 LPB fibrosarcoma cells
in 0.9% NaCl, were injected into the right flank of each
mouse. The control group was treated with drinking
water only (n = 16). A 0.2 mg/ml solution of nitroxoline
was given to mice ad libitum in their drinking water for
the entire duration of the study (n = 13) or for 15 days
only (n = 7). From the volume of consumed solution
(4.0±0.7 ml/mouse/day), the mice received a nitroxoline
dose of 40±7 mg/kg. CA-074 (10 mg/kg) was injected
intraperitoneally every second day, alone (n = 7) or in
combination with ad libitum nitroxoline in the drinking
water (n = 6). Tumor growth was determined daily using
a digital Vernier caliper, from the sixth day after the
induction of tumors on. Tumor volume was calculated
according to the following formula: V = (tumor width2 ×
tumor length)/6. From the tumor growth curves, the time
required to reach a volume of 40 mm3 was determined.
Tumor growth delay was determined as the difference
in the time required for tumors to reach a volume of 40
mm3 between the experimental and the control group. The
weight of the mice was followed as a general indicator of
systemic toxicity.

Tube formation assay
Before each experiment cells were incubated for
24 h with corresponding compounds, then trypsinized
and counted. Cells were then plated (SVEC4-10 – 2×104,
HUVEC – 1.9×104, HMEC-1 – 1.3×104 cells/well) on
µ-Slide Angiogenesis (Ibidi, Martinsried, Germany)
covered with 10 µl of undiluted Matrigel and incubated
until the formation of tubular complexes. Tubular
complexes were stained with Calcein AM according to
manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma-Aldrich). Images
were captured with an Olympus DP72 CCD camera
connected to an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope.
AxioVision program (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was
used to convert raw images into binary masks of tubular
complexes. The pixels above the threshold – Calcein
positive – were given a value of 1 and all other pixels
below the threshold – Calcein negative – were given a
value of 0, creating a binary mask of the tubular networks
that were quantified with the AngioQuant image analysis
program [45]. The number, length and size of tubular
complexes and the number of junctions were recorded.

MMTV-PyMT mouse breast cancer model
FVB/N mice and a transgenic mouse strain
expressing PyMT oncogene under the control of MMTV
LTR promoter (FVB/N-TgN (MMTVPyVT)634Mul) were used [27]. The orthotopic mouse model was
established as described previously [46]. 5×105 of primary
MMTV-PyMT tumor cells in SFM were inoculated
into the left inguinal mammary gland of the congenic
recipient FVB mouse. Tumor bearing FVB mice were
divided randomly into two groups. When tumor volume
reached 125 mm3, mice were treated every second day,
one group (n = 6) with vehicle as control, and the other
(n = 6) with 40 mg/kg nitroxoline in 5% DMSO in peanut
oil, intraperitoneally. Tumor volume was measured and
calculated as mentioned above.
In a separate experiment, transgenic PyMT mice
were divided randomly into two groups at the age of 11

weeks. They were treated every second day, one group
(n = 10) was injected intraperitoneally with vehicle,
and the other group (n = 14) with 40 mg/kg nitroxoline
in 5% DMSO in peanut oil. Mice were sacrificed at 14
weeks of age; mammary tumor tissues were collected
and weighed. Lungs were dissected and processed for
histomorphometric analysis. Tumor vascularization, the
number and the average size of lung metastasis in PyMT
mice was determined as reported [34].
