Abstract
Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a constituent of many
edible cruciferous vegetables, exerts significant protection
against chemically induced cancer in animal models and
inhibits growth of cancer cells in culture and in vivo by
causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. In this study,
we report a novel response to PEITC involving the regulation
of translation initiation at pharmacologically achievable
concentrations. Treatment of human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells and human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, but not a
normal prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC), with PEITC caused
an increase in expression of the eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein (4E-BP1) and
inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Results from pull-down
assay using 7-methyl-GTP Sepharose 4B beads indicated that
PEITC treatment reduced cap-bound eIF4E, confirming that
increased 4E-BP1 expression and inhibition of 4E-BP1
phosphorylation indeed reduced the availability of eIF4E for
translation initiation. Accordingly, results from in vivo
translation using luciferase reporter assay indicated that
PEITC treatment inhibited cap-dependent translation, in
particular the translation of mRNA with secondary structure
(stem-loop structure). Ectopic expression of eIF4E prevented
PEITC-induced translation inhibition and conferred significant protection against PEITC-induced apoptosis. These
results indicate that PEITC modulates availability of eIF4E
for translation initiation leading to inhibition of capdependent translation. The present study also suggests that
inhibition of cap-dependent translation may be an important
mechanism in PEITC-induced apoptosis. [Cancer Res 2007;

Introduction
Epidemiologic studies continue to support the premise that
dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables may be protective against
the risk of various types of malignancies (1). The anticarcinogenic
effect of cruciferous vegetables is attributed to organic isothiocyanates (ITC), which are present in a variety of edible cruciferous
vegetables such as broccoli (1). Phenethyl ITC (PEITC) is one of the
best studied members of the ITC family of compounds that has

generated a great deal of research interest due to its cancer
chemopreventive activity (2).
Very little information currently exists regarding the involvement
of translational control in chemoprotective effects of dietary
agents. The exclusive emphasis on transcriptional regulation has
overlooked the molecular events and pathways involved in
translational control in cancer chemoprevention. However, evidence is accumulating to indicate that targeting protein translation
represents one of the most promising approaches for cancer
intervention (3). Therefore, identification of natural compounds
that modulate translational control is considered a highly
promising strategy for the development of anticancer agents.
In eukaryotes, about 90% of protein is synthesized through capdependent translation. It is estimated that up to 10% of all mRNAs
are translated by an alternative initiation mechanism that involves
a complex RNA structural element termed an internal ribosome
entry segment (IRES). A key step of cap-dependent mRNA
translation is the binding of the eukaryotic translation initiation
factor 4E (eIF4E) to mRNA molecules with a 5¶-terminal 7-methylGTP cap. The availability of eIF4E for binding to the cap structure
of mRNA is regulated by the phosphorylation of a small family of
eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BP). 4E-BP1, the most abundant
member of the 4E-BP family, can be phosphorylated at multiple
sites in a sequential order, and a combination of phosphorylation
events is necessary to dissociate 4E-BP1 from eIF4E (4).
Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 decreases the affinity of the protein
for eIF4E, which facilitates the formation of eIF4F complex
(consisting of eIF4A, eIF4G, and eIF4E) for the initiation of capdependent translation.
Both 4E-BP1 and eIF4E are involved in the regulation of
apoptosis. For instance, increased expression of eIF4E was
sufficient to inhibit apoptosis in serum-restricted primary fibroblasts (5), whereas ectopic expression of 4E-BP1 activates apoptosis
(6). The ability of 4E-BP1 to induce apoptosis is governed by its
phosphorylation status (6). This finding, along with the observation
that enforced expression of 4E-BP1 sensitizes fibroblasts to
apoptosis in a manner strictly dependent on its ability to sequester
eIF4E from a translationally active complex (7), strongly suggests
that 4E-BP1 and eIF4E’s regulation of translation initiation account
for their apoptosis modulation.
We now show that PEITC effectively induces 4E-BP1 expression
and inhibits 4E-BP1 phosphorylation leading to reduced availability
of eIF4E for cap-dependent translation. Reduced eIF4E availability
not only leads to inhibition of translation but also plays a crucial
role in PEITC-induced apoptosis. We propose that inhibition of
protein translation may be an important event in the overall
scheme of cancer chemoprevention by PEITC.

Translational Control and PEITC-Induced Apoptosis
Cell culture and PEITC treatment. HCT-116 were cultured in McCoy’s
5a modified medium (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 1.5 mmol/L
L-glutamine (Sigma). Culture of prostate cancer cell PC-3 cells and normal
prostate epithelial cell line PrEC (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) has been
described previously (10, 11). All other cell culture reagents were purchased
from Mediatech. For PEITC treatment, the cells were exposed to PEITC
(1, 2.5, and 5 Amol/L) or DMSO ( final concentration 0.05% was added to
the controls) for the indicated time. After PEITC treatment, the cells were
harvested for further analysis.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The assays were done as
described previously (12).
7-Methyl-GTP Sepharose 4B pull-down assay. After PEITC treatment,
the HCT-116 cells were lysed with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer, and the
whole cell lysates were used for the pull-down assay with 7-methyl-GTP
Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom).
Precipitated proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed
by immunoblotting for eIF4E.
Transient transfection assays of translation. An in vivo translation
assay of the reporter system was done as described previously (9). Protein
concentration of each well was measured and used for normalizing
luciferase activity.
Reverse transcription-PCR. The total RNA was isolated by TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen, Cincinnati, OH) according to the protocol provided by
the manufacturer. The primers used to amplify 200 bases of the firefly
luciferase gene were 5¶-CTG CAT CCG GCT ATG AAG AGA TAC G-3¶ and
5¶-CCC AAC TGC AAC TCC GAT AAA TAA CGC-3¶. The primers used to amplify
146 bp of the housekeeping gene h-actin were 5¶-CATGGAGTCCTGTGGCATCCACGAAACT-3¶ and 5¶-ATCTCCTTCTGCATCCTGTCGGCAAT-3¶.

Detection of apoptosis and cell proliferation analysis. The PEITCinduced apoptosis was assessed by (a) flow-cytometric analysis of
subdiploid cells (sub-G0/G1 cells with DNA fragmentation) after staining
with propidium iodide and (b) ELISA-based quantitation of cytoplasmic
histone-associated DNA fragmentation using a commercially available kit
from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The experimental procedure was as we
described previously (13, 14). The effect of PEITC on cell growth was
evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion assays as described previously (11).

Results and Discussion
PEITC treatment caused apoptosis in HCT-116 cells. It is
known that PEITC suppresses cancer cell proliferation by causing
cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis (11, 15, 16). In colorectal cancer
HT-29 cells, treatment with PEITC at a relative high dose
(10–50 Amol/L) induces apoptosis at the shortest time point of
3-h exposure (17). In this study, we tested whether chronic
exposure (24–48 h) to PEITC at pharmacologically relevant concentrations exerts a similar effect in colorectal cancer HCT-116
cells. Because the maximal plasma concentration of PEITC
following ingestion of 100 g watercress was shown to vary between
673 and 1,155 nmol/L (18), we decided to focus on the effect of
PEITC treatment at dose range of 1–5 Amol/L.
As shown in Table 1, the fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analysis results showed that statistically significant induction of
apoptosis by PEITC was evident at concentrations within the
pharmacologically achievable range. For instance, the percentage of

The whole cell lysates were used for the pull-down assay with 7-methyl-GTP Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham). The cap-bound eIF4E was evaluated by
immunoblotting with eIF4E antibody. The input eIF4E was evaluated by immunoprecipitation with eIF4E and followed by immunoblotting with eIF4E. B and C, in vivo

concentration for 24 h. The cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was measured using Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The luciferase activity of
each sample was normalized by protein concentration. These experiments were repeated thrice with four independent transfections, and representative data are
shown. *, P < 0.01, significantly different compared with DMSO-treated control by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test. D, RT-PCR amplification of luciferase

cells undergoing apoptosis (sub-G1/G0) increased from 1.81% in
control cells to 4.42% in cells treated with 1 Amol/L PEITC for
24 h and 8.55% in cells treated with 1 Amol/L PEITC for 48 h. In
addition, these results clearly show that PEITC induces apoptosis
but does not cause G1 or G2-M arrest, suggesting that induction of
apoptosis is the major mechanism of PEITC-induced inhibition of
cell proliferation in HCT-116 cells.
PEITC treatment increased 4E-BP1 expression and inhibited
phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Apoptosis induction is often
associated with reduced eIF4E availability due to increased binding
of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 (19). The findings that enforced expression of
4E-BP1 promotes apoptosis and the phosphorylation status of
4E-BP1 governs its proapoptotic potency (6) prompted us to test
whether PEITC-induced apoptosis involved 4E-BP1 modulation.
Indeed, treatment of HCT-116 cells with 1 Amol/L PEITC markedly
increased cellular level of 4E-BP1 protein (Fig. 1A). In addition,
PEITC treatment inhibited phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at S65 and
at Thr70 especially at 2.5 and 5 Amol/L concentrations. Although it

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

seemed that PEITC treatment failed to inhibit 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at Thr37/46 sites, we propose that this might be due to the
increased amount of 4E-BP1 by PEITC treatment. It is also possible
that the lack of inhibition of 4E-BP1 at Thr37/46 resulted from the
fact that specific signaling pathways involved in Thr37/46 were not
affected by PEITC. The PEITC-inhibited 4E-BP1 phosphorylation
was more pronounced at 48-h time point relative to 24 h of
exposure. Together, these data showed modulation of 4E-BP1
protein level and phosphorylation by PEITC even at pharmacologically achievable concentration.
Next, we tested whether the effect of PEITC on 4E-BP1 was
restricted to HCT-116 cells due to its unique genetic background by
examining the effect of PEITC on 4E-BP1 protein level/phosphorylation in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. Similar to HCT-116
cells, PEITC treatment not only increased the expression of 4E-BP1
protein, but also inhibited 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at S65 and Thr70
but not at Thr37/46 in PC-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 1B). To determine if the effect of PEITC on 4E-BP1 was cancer
cell specific, we used a normal prostate epithelial cell line PrEC,
which is resistant to growth inhibition and apoptosis induction
by PEITC (11). Interestingly, PEITC treatment neither caused induction of 4E-BP1 expression nor inhibited 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in
PrEC cells. The induction of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at Thr37/46
and S65 in PrEC cells may result from the fact that PEITC differentially targets signaling pathways in cancer cells versus normal
cells. It is also possible that certain signaling events are affected
differently by PEITC in cancer cells and normal epithelial cells.
Two conclusions can be drawn from these experiments: (a) the
effect of PEITC on 4E-BP1 protein level and phosphorylation is not
cancer cell type specific and (b) resistance of PrEC cells to growth
inhibition and cell death may be partly attributable to the lack
of 4E-BP1 induction and reduced phosphorylation by PEITC.
PEITC treatment reduced the eIF4E availability and
inhibited cap-dependent translation of the luciferase reporter
gene. Because a combination of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation events is
necessary to dissociate 4E-BP1 from eIF4E (4) and binding of eIF4E
to mRNA cap structure (M7GpppX) is essential for initiating capdependent protein translation, we hypothesized that the induction
of 4E-BP1 protein expression and inhibition of its phosphorylation
may reduce the availability of eIF4E for translation initiation. The
results from pull-down with 7-methyl-GTP Sepharose 4B beads
confirmed that the binding of eIF4E to mRNA molecules with a
5¶-terminal 7-methyl-GTP cap was remarkably reduced (Fig. 2A),
demonstrating that PEITC treatment reduced the availability of
eIF4E for cap-dependent translation initiation.
Next, we examined if reduction of eIF4E availability for
translation initiation indeed caused inhibition of cap-dependent
translation, a major mechanism by which mRNAs are translated to
proteins. To evaluate the cap-dependent translation, we used the
luciferase cDNA reporter with or without stable secondary
structure (stem-loop) introduced in the 5¶ leader sequence
(pcDNA-SL-LUC versus pcDNA-LUC; ref. 9). As shown in Fig. 2B,
treatment with PEITC significantly suppressed the translation of
the luciferase reporter gene with stem-loop structure (pcDNA-SLLUC). To a lesser extent, PEITC treatment at 7.5 Amol/L concentration suppressed the translation of the luciferase reporter gene
without the stem-loop structure (pcDNA-LUC; Fig. 2C). The PEITCmediated inhibition of the luciferase reporter gene expression with
stem-loop structure was not due to a decrease in mRNA level of
the luciferase gene as judged by reverse transcription-PCR (RTPCR; Fig. 2D), confirming that the inhibition of the luciferase gene

was at the translational level. To rule out the possibility of
cell type–specific effect, we determined the effect of PEITC on
cap-dependent translation using PC-3 cells. Similar to HCT-116
cells, PEITC treatment decreased the translation of pcDNA-SLLUC, but did not have any appreciable effect on the translation
of pcDNA-LUC (data not shown). Although it remains to be
determined whether PEITC treatment affects mRNA translation through IRES mechanism, our data indicated that PEITC
treatment inhibited cap-dependent translation, and PEITC preferentially inhibited cap-dependent translation of mRNAs with
secondary structure. One potential explanation for this phenomenon is that translation of mRNA with a stable secondary structure
at the 5¶ untranslated region (UTR) would be more susceptible to
the changes of formation of eIF4F complex, and there is a greater
need for eIF4E for initiation of translation.
Ectopic expression of eIF4E confers significant protection
against PEITC-induced apoptosis. Stress-induced apoptosis is
often associated with the down-regulation of protein translation
(19) and the down-regulation of protein translation can result in
apoptosis as well (20). However, the down-regulation of protein
synthesis is not always sufficient to cause apoptosis (20). To
determine whether translation inhibition is simply a consequence
of PEITC-induced apoptosis or translation inhibition is crucial for
PEITC-induced apoptosis, we tested if overexpression of eIF4E
prevents PEITC-induced apoptosis.

As expected, enforced expression of eIF4E not only prevented
PEITC-mediated translation inhibition (data not shown), but also
significantly blocked PEITC-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3A and B) in
HCT116 cells. Moreover, enforced expression of eIF4E also blocked
PEITC-caused inhibition of cell proliferation (data not shown).
Similarly, overexpression of eIF4E prevented PEITC-induced
inhibition of translation and apoptosis in PC-3 cells (data not
shown). Together, these data strongly suggest that inhibition of
translation is the cause but not a consequence of PEITC-induced
apoptosis.
In conclusion, the present study shows that PEITC treatment
modulates translation regulators, and PEITC is a potent inhibitor
of cap-dependent translation. It is important to note that the
PEITC-mediated inhibition of protein translation occurs at
concentrations achievable by dietary intervention or pharmacologic administration and seems selective for cancer cells. We
speculate that inhibition of protein translation may be an
important mechanism in the overall scheme of PEITC-mediated
cancer prevention.
