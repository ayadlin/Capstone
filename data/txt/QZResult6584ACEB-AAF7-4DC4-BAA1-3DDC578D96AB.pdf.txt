ABSTRACT
Lack of differentiation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with
increased circulating platelet size. We measured platelet activation and plasma
adenosine diphosphate (ADP) levels in HCC patients based on differentiation status.
Local platelet accumulation and platelet-hepatoma cell binding were measured using
immunohistochemistry (IHC) or flow cytometry. Using a xenograft assay in NON/SCID
mice, we tested the effects of the anti-platelet drug clopidogrel on platelet activation,
platelet infiltration, platelet-tumor cell binding and tumor cell differentiation. HCC
patients with poor differentiation status displayed elevated platelet activation and
higher ADP levels. Platelets accumulated within poorly differentiated tissues and
localized at hepatoma cell membranes. Platelet-tumor cell binding was existed in
carcinoma tissues, largely mediated by P-selectin on platelets. NOD/SCID mice with
xenograft tumors also exhibited increased platelet activation and platelet-tumor cell
binding. Clopidogrel therapy triggered hepatoma cell differentiation by attenuating
platelet activation and platelet-tumor cell binding. TCF4 knockdown promoted HepG2 cell differentiation and inhibited tumor formation, and TCF4 could be the potential
downstream target for clopidogrel therapy.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a severe complication
in HCC. Up to 40% of HCC patients have PVT at the
time of diagnosis [9], and are more likely to experience
metastasis and shortened survival compared to patients
without PVT [10-12]. This indicates that platelets are hyperactivated in HCC. Increased platelet activation has been
reported in HCC, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer
and colon cancer, and is associated with increased tumornode-metastasis (TNM) stage and risk of recurrence [1316]. Activated platelets are reportedly involved in critical
steps in cancer progression, including facilitating tumor cell
growth and migration within vasculature [17].

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause
of cancer-related mortality worldwide [1]. Surgery is the
primary intervention for early-stage HCC, but recurrence
and metastasis rates are still very high in five years postsurgery [2]. Degree of differentiation is widely accepted as
an important prognostic indicator of metastasis, recurrence
and chemotherapy resistance in solid tumors, including
HCC [3-6]. In clinical practice, more than 50% of HCCs
are pathologically diagnosed as moderately or poorly
differentiated carcinomas [7, 8].

Platelet-tumor cell binding in tumor tissues and
cell culture

Circulating platelets are heterogeneous in size,
density and reactivity [18-20]. Large platelets are
hyperactive in function, express high levels of membrane
proteins, contain greater number of dense granules,
release a large amount of adenosine diphosphate (ADP),
and are more resistant to anti-platelet drugs [18, 19,
21]. Thus, mean platelet volume (MPV, a measurement
of platelet size) and the proportion of large platelets are
important hematological parameters that reflect platelet
activation. In our preliminary retrospective study, we
found that MPV and the proportion of large platelets in
patients with poorly differentiated HCC were higher
than in patients with well-differentiated tumors. We
studied whether the anti-platelet drug, clopidogrel, could
act as anti-cancer therapeutics by promoting tumor cell
differentiation, independent of thrombus formation. We
reported that tumor tissue-accumulated platelets induced
platelet-tumor cell binding and inhibited tumor cell
differentiation. Clopidogrel suppressed platelet-tumor cell
binding and induced hepatoma cell differentiation in the
xenograft model. These findings revealed the efficacy of
anti-platelet drugs in HCC treatment.

We tested the degree of platelet binding to tumor
cells in human HCC tissues and HepG-2 cell culture.
Platelet-tumor cell binding increased by 40% in the
poorly/moderately differentiated carcinoma tissues
compared with well differentiated tissues (poorly/
moderately: 23.2±3.4%; well: 15±2.8%, Figure 3A & 3C).
We co-cultured HepG-2 cells with platelets isolated from
healthy controls or HCC patients and found that platelets
from HCC patients bind more frequently with HepG-2
cells than platelets from healthy controls (HCC patients:
18.7±1.7%; healthy control: 10.9±1.9%, Figure 3B & 3D).
In the co-culture system, P-selectin blocking antibody
abolished about 50% of platelet-tumor cell binding (Figure
3E), indicating that the binding was largely mediated by
P-selectin on platelets.

Anti-platelet intervention abolished tumor cellevoked platelet activation and induced tumor
cell differentiation in the mouse xenograft model
Similar to patients, mice with HepG-2 cell tumors
had elevated P-selectin positive platelets and plasma
ADP levels in comparison to healthy controls (Figure 4B
& 4C). To determine whether platelets were involved in
tumor progression, after three weeks of transplantation,
mice received clopidogrel treatment for another three
weeks. Clopidogrel efficacy was examined by measuring
tail bleeding time. Prolonged tail bleeding was observed
in the clopidogrel treatment group, indicating that the drug
effectively inhibited platelets in our model (Figure 4A).
In xenograft tumors, clopidogrel reduced the proportion
of P-selectin positive platelets (non-treated: 5.7±0.4%;
clopidogrel-treated: 4.3±0.5%, Figure 4B), the amount
of platelet-tumor cell binding (non-treated: 11.8±0.8%;
clopidogrel-treated: 1.9±0.2%, Figure 4D) and platelet
local infiltration (Figure 4E & 4F). Clopidogrel treatment
inhibited tumor growth from day 15 to day 21 compared
with non-treated mice as indicated by tumor volumes
(Figure 5A). Anti-platelet treatment induced CK8/CK18
and CK7 expression and reduced vimentin levels (Figure
5B), indicating that clopidogrel triggered hepatoma
cell differentiation. This finding was confirmed by IHC
showing that the abundance of heppar-1 (a specific HCC
differentiation marker) in the non-treated group was
decreased compared with the treatment group (Figure
5C–5E).

RESULTS
Elevated platelet activation and
circulating ADP levels in relation to HCC
differentiation status
Hematological parameters were determined in
HCC tissue samples and patients were grouped by
differentiation status. Patients with well and moderately
differentiated tumors were older than those with poorly
differentiated tumors (Table 1). Platelet count had no
differences among the three groups, while MPV, platelet
distribution width (PDW) and the proportion of large
platelets were considerably greater in the moderately and
poorly differentiated groups (Figure 1A–1D, Table 1).
Patients with moderate and poor differentiation displayed
high percentages of P-selectin positive platelets compared
to those with well differentiated tumors or healthy controls
(Figure 1E). Plasma levels of ADP in moderately/poorly
differentiated patients increased by 2-fold compared with
the other two groups (Figure 1F).

Platelet accumulation within HCC tissues
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed platelets
(CD41+) accumulated in HCC tissues (Figure 2A–
2H). Poorly differentiated tissues displayed prominent
platelet accumulation, while staining was reduced in
well-differentiated tissues (Figure 2A–2C). In poorly
differentiated tissues, platelets were largely found in the
hepatoma cell membrane (Figure 2E), intravascular regions
(Figure 2G) and connective tissues (Figure 2H). We thus
hypothesized that platelets might bind to hepatoma cells.

TCF4 knockdown inhibited cell growth (Figure 7D–7E),
and suppressed the number of Ki67-postive cells (Figure

genes were markedly changed in the tumor tissues after
anti-platelet intervention, and we confirmed repression of
TCF4 promoted hepatoma cell differentiation.
Platelets have been shown to mediate tumorigenicity
via two fundamental mechanisms. First, platelet activation
induces granular release of mediators, which directly
support tumor growth and migration [22, 23]. Second,
platelets can bind to different types of cancer cells,
largely mediated by P-selectin on platelets and sialylated
fucosylated carbohydrates on tumor cells [24-26]. Such
binding protects tumor cells from immune attack or leads
to tumor cell metastasis via epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) [27, 28]. Platelets reportedly bind to
breast cancer, melanoma, neuroblastoma, lung cancer,
colon cancer and insulinoma cells [24, 27-31]. Consistent
with this, we confirmed that HepG-2 cells bind platelets
extracted from HCC patients, and less so to platelets
from healthy persons, indicating that platelets from HCC
patients were more activated. Further, increased platelettumor cell binding was detected in poorly differentiated as
compared to well-differentiated HCC tissues, supporting

our IHC results showing that platelets largely co-existed
on hepatoma cell membranes. We speculated this binding
would activate certain intracellular pathways and
eventually prevent hepatoma cell differentiation. The
hypothesis that platelet-tumor cell binding drives tumor
cell escape into vasculature, promoting circulated tumor
cells (CTC), requires further investigation.
It remains unclear how platelets are activated
in cancer patients. P2Y receptors, including P2Y1 and
P2Y12, are G-protein coupled receptors that control
critical steps in platelet activation. ADP initially binds
P2Y1 and induces transient activation of platelets,
which is subsequently strengthened and sustained by
interaction with P2Y12 [32, 33]. Generation of ADP has
been documented in neuroblastoma, breast cancer and
melanoma cells, and induces platelet activation [34, 35].
ADP depletion diminished tumor cell-induced platelet
activation and was associated with reduced metastasis
in mice [36]. In the present study, we demonstrated
that plasma ADP levels were increased in HCC patients
compared to healthy controls, and were higher in patients

with well-differentiated compared to moderately or poorly
differentiated disease. Similar results were observed in the
mouse xenograft tumor model.
Inflammation also causes platelet activation. Most
HCC cases are associated with hepatitis B-induced chronic
inflammatory responses [37]. In a mouse model of chronic
hepatitis B, Sitia, et al. showed that activated platelets
contributed to acute hepatocellular injury-induced HCC
by enhancing the accumulation of virus-specific CD8 T
cells [38]. Clopidogrel combined with aspirin effectively
prevented or delayed HCC progression and improved
survival.
Tumor thrombosis is a severe cancer complication
and forms the rationale for using anti-platelet drugs in
cancer therapy. Besides inhibition of thrombus formation,
clinical trials have documented broad benefits of antiplatelet drugs. As one of the most commonly used antiplatelet drugs, aspirin has been extensively studied in
breast and colorectal cancer, demonstrating positive effects
with respect to disease recurrence and patient mortality
[39, 40]. Aspirin in combination with surgical treatment
of non-small-cell lung cancer improved patient survival
rates [41]. Moreover, aspirin decreased the proangiogenic
effect of tamoxifen in breast cancer patients [42, 43]. In a

retrospective analysis of prostate cancer, both aspirin and
clopidogrel improved prognosis in patients undergoing
radiation [44]. In a murine model, targeting of platelet
membrane receptor GPIIb/IIIa, GPIb-IX-V or GPVI
reduced pulmonary metastasis [45-49]. Clopidogrel
reduced tumor growth and metastasis in a mouse model of
pancreatic caner and breast cancer [50, 51]. In the present
study, we demonstrated that clopidogrel treatment at a
daily dosage of 5 mg/kg for three weeks induced tumor
cell differentiation and inhibited tumor growth. The
treatment in our study was started three weeks post-tumor
implantation, and is thus applicable to clinical settings.
In our study, we used only clopidogrel, and not aspirin,
since clopidogrel was highly specific for platelets. Aspirin
inhibits thromboxane A2 (TXA2) production by altering
the activity of both cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX2, which are present in platelets, but also in other types of
cells, including cancer cells.
A microarray assay was performed to identify
potential anti-platelet intervention target candidates in
hepatoma cells. A total 214 genes were differentially
expressed between treated and non-treated cells, and
about 40 genes involved in promoting cancer progression
were upregulated in the non-treated group. Some, such

as CCAR1, MALAT1, FOXP1, TCF4 and CUX1 were
previously reported as highly expressed in HCC [52-56].
We demonstrated that TCF4 was a pivotal differentiation
regulator in hepatoma cells, and TCF4 repression
promoted HepG-2 cell differentiation and inhibited tumor
formation. How platelet-tumor cell binding enhances TCF4
expression in hepatoma cells needs further investigation.
In conclusion, we found that platelets were highly
activated in poorly differentiated HCC. Accumulation
of activated platelets in HCC tissues induced platelettumor cell binding. Clopidogrel effectively inhibited
platelet-tumor cell binding and promoted hepatoma cell
differentiation. These results identify platelets as potential
key regulators in HCC differentiation, supporting the use
of anti-platelet therapy in cancer patients. Clopidogrel, as a
common, inexpensive and safe intervention might constitute
an effective adjuvant to chemotherapy or radiotherapy for
both tumor inhibition and thrombosis prevention in HCC.

ADP levels in patient and mouse plasma samples
were determined using the ADP-Glo™ Kinase Assay kit
(Promega) following the supplier’s instructions.

Cell culture
The human hepatoma cell line, HepG-2, was
obtained from the Shanghai Cell Bank. Cells were
maintained in DMEM (Gibco, high glucose) containing
10% FBS (Gibco) and cultured in a humidified 5% CO2
atmosphere at 37°C.

Mouse xenograft assay and anti-platelet
intervention
Six-week-old NOD/SCID mice were obtained
from the animal center of Dalian Medical University
and were maintained under specific pathogen free
conditions. Mouse care and use protocols were approved
by the Animal Committee of Dalian Medical University
in accordance with national guidelines. HepG-2 cells
(1x106) were subcutaneously injected into the right flank.
After transplantation, body weight and tumor size were
measured every two days. For anti-platelet treatment,
mice were randomly assigned into two groups and one
group received clopidogrel treatment after three weeks
transplantation. Tablets containing clopidogrel (75 mg)
were ground into fine powder, freshly emulsified in 0.5%
methyl cellulose solution and administered by gavage. A
loading dose of 15 mg/kg was given at the first day of
treatment, followed by the maintenance dose of 5 mg/
kg once daily for the remainder of the three weeks [57].
The non-treated group was given 0.5% methyl cellulose
solution by gavage.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient characteristics
We retrospectively analyzed 100 histologically
diagnosed HCC patients who received a partial
hepatectomy between January 2009 and December 2014 at
the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University.
Patients with conditions that might affect platelet
parameters, such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular
diseases and anti-platelet drug use, were excluded from
the study. Routine hematological assays examined prior to
surgery were recorded. Fresh blood samples were obtained
from 24 HCC patients prior to surgery and 8 healthy
controls. Experimental protocols were approved by the
ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian
Medical University.

Determination of P-selectin positive platelets in
human and mouse

Bleeding time measurement
Inhibition of platelet activity by clopidogrel was
tested by measuring tail bleeding time as previously
reported [57]. Both treated and non-treated mice were
subjected to bleeding time measurements. Sterile saline
was poured into a 50 ml test tube and heated in a 37°C
water bath for 1 h. A 10-mm segment of the tail tip was
cut off and the tip of the tail was immersed in pre-warmed
saline. Bleeding time was defined as the period of time
where there was a clearly visible stream of blood that was
continuously flowing.

Human venous blood samples were collected into
a standardized tube containing EDTA as anticoagulant.
Mouse blood was collected by cardiac puncture. To obtain
platelet-rich plasma (PRP), blood (1 ml) was mixed
with 300 μl of platelet washing buffer (pH 6.5, 4.3 mM
K2HPO4, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, 24.3 mM NaH2PO4, 113 mM
NaCl, 5.5 mM glucose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin,
10 mM theophylline) and then centrifuged at 250 g
for 2 min. Platelet pellets from PRP were collected by
centrifugation at 2,000 g for 2 min and re-suspended in
1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in PBS for flow cytometry.
P-selectin antibody or isotype control (FITC-conjugated,
BD Biosciences) was added to 10 μl of PRP and incubated
for 30 min in darkness. P-selectin positive platelets
were recorded and analyzed with a Becton-Dickinson
FACSCalibur flow cytometer with FlowJo software.

for 30 min in darkness. Cells obtained from mice tumor
specimens were incubated with anti-mouse CD41 (FITCconjugated, BD Biosciences), anti-mouse CD45 (PEconjugated, BD Biosciences) and anti-mouse CD31 (APCconjugated, BD Biosciences). CD45 and CD31 antibodies
were used to exclude leukocytes and endothelial cells in
tissue samples.
Washed platelets from HCC patients and healthy
controls were extracted as previously described. HepG-2
cells were co-cultured with platelets at 1:100 for 24 h [27].
P-selectin blocking antibody (25 μg/ml, R&D system) or
IgG control antibody (BD Biosciences) was added to the
co-culture. After 24 h, cells were harvested. re-suspended
in FACS buffer and then incubated with anti-human
CD41 antibody (FITC-conjugated, BD Biosciences).
Cells were thoroughly washed and then analyzed using
a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Analysis was performed
using FlowJo software. The percentage of CD41 positive
cells in total hepatoma cells was determined.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were seeded on poly-lysine pre-coated cover
slides, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature
for 20 min and then permeabilized in 1% Triton-X 100
for 10 min. After blocking in 5% of BSA, slides were
incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C,
followed by secondary antibody conjugated with Alex-488
for 30 min. Nuclei were stained with DAPI.

Immunohistochemistry
IHC was used to determine the contents of platelets
(CD41) or hepatocyte specific antigen (heppar-1)
expression in tumor sections. Paraffin-embedded HCC
tissue samples or mouse xenograft tumors were cut at a
thickness of 5 μm and then mounted on coated microscope
slides. Briefly, antigen retrieval was conducted by slide
immersion in citrate-EDTA buffer followed by 5 min in
a microwave oven at high power. Non-specific staining
was blocked using 10% goat serum. After blocking, 50
μl of primary antibody (CD41, BD biosciences; heppar-1,
Novus) was applied to each section for 1 h. A mouse IgG
isotype control antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was
used at the same concentration as primary antibodies.
After incubation with secondary antibody, sections
were incubated with DAB until the desired staining
developed. Sections were then counterstained with Myer’s
hematoxylin for 2 min, then dehydrated and mounted with
DePex.

Microarray assay and comprehensive
bioinformatics analysis
Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene
expression profiling was performed using the
Human Genome UI33 plus 2.0 array according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix). Fifteen
micrograms of complementary RNA was fractionated and
hybridized to an Affymetrix GeneChip.

Validation of microarray data by qPCR analysis
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to
verify the differential expression of 14 selected genes
that were detected by microarray. These genes included
CCAR1, MALAT1, FOXP1, TCF4, PAK2, CUX1, TRRAP,
PDGFA, ZNF217, DICER1, P4HB, HSPH1 and AKAP2.
qPCR analysis was performed with a 7500 system, and
primers are listed in Table 2. Cycling conditions included
an initial, 5 min cycle at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of
30 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 54°C, and 15 sec at 72°C. Gene
expression was quantified relative to 18S expression.

Detection of platelet-tumor cell binding in tissues
and cell culture
To assess conjugation between platelets and
hepatoma cells, platelet marker CD41 positive tumor cells
were measured in both cell culture and tumor samples
using flow cytometry. Tissues from HCC patients and
mice were mechanically dissociated using a scalpel,
transferred to DMEM containing 1:1 collagenase I (3 mg/
mL):hyaluronidase (100 U/mL; Sigma) and incubated
at 37°C for 2 h on a shaking incubator. After filtration
through a 40-μm filter, specimens were dissociated
into single cells and washed with PBS several times.
Cells were plated in DMEM with 10% FBS. After 2 h,
fibroblasts were adhered. Un-adhered cells were collected
by centrifugation and re-suspended in FACS buffer. Cells
from human HCC tissues were incubated with anti-human
CD41 (FITC-conjugated, BD Biosciences), anti-human
CD45 (PE-conjugated, BD Biosciences) and anti-human
CD31 (Alex Fluor 647-conjugated, BD Biosciences)
