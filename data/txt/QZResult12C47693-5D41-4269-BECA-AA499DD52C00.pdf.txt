SUMMARY
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Identification of driver mutations in human diseases is often limited by cohort size and availability
of appropriate statistical models. We propose a novel framework for the systematic discovery of
genetic alterations that are causal determinants of disease, by prioritizing genes upstream of
functional disease drivers, within regulatory networks inferred de novo from experimental data.
We tested this framework by identifying the genetic determinants of the mesenchymal subtype of
glioblastoma. Our analysis uncovered KLHL9 deletions as upstream activators of two previously
established master regulators of the subtype, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. Rescue of KLHL9 expression
induced proteasomal degradation of C/EBP proteins, abrogated the mesenchymal signature, and
reduced tumor viability in vitro and in vivo. Deletions of KLHL9 were confirmed in >50% of
mesenchymal cases in an independent cohort, thus representing the most frequent genetic
determinant of the subtype. The method generalized to study other human diseases, including
breast cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Identification of somatic mutations and germline variants that are determinants of cancer
and other complex human diseases/traits (driver mutations) is mostly performed on a
statistical basis, using models of genomic evolution (Frattini et al., 2013) or mutational bias
(Lawrence et al., 2013), etc., to increase the significance of individual events. Achieving
appropriate statistical power, however, requires large effect sizes or large cohorts due to
multiple hypothesis testing correction (Califano et al., 2012). In addition, these approaches
are not designed to provide mechanistic insight. As a result, many disease risk determinants,
such as apolipoprotein E, were discovered long before they were mechanistically elucidated
(Liu et al., 2013).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Network-based analyses have recently emerged as a highly effective framework for the
discovery of Master Regulator (MR) genes that are functional disease drivers (Aytes et al.,
2014a; Carro et al., 2010; Lefebvre et al., 2010; Piovan et al., 2013; Sumazin et al., 2011;
Zhao et al., 2009). Here, we introduce DIGGIT (Driver-gene Inference by GeneticalGenomic Information Theory), an algorithm to identify genetic determinants of disease by
systematically exploring regulatory/signaling networks upstream of MR genes. This
collapses the number of testable hypotheses and provides regulatory clues to help elucidate
associated mechanisms.
We first apply DIGGIT to identify causal genetic determinants of the MES-GBM subtype,
which remain poorly characterized despite extensive efforts (Brennan et al., 2013; Verhaak
et al., 2010). We then demonstrate its generalizability to other diseases for which matched
expression and mutational data are available.
Astrocytoma grade IV or glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common human brain malignancy
and is virtually incurable, with average survival of 12–18 months post diagnosis (Ohgaki
and Kleihues, 2005). Gene expression profile analysis revealed three subtypes associated
with expression of mesenchymal, proliferative, and pro-neural genes, respectively (Phillips
et al., 2006). Among these, mesenchymal tumors (MES-GBM) present with worst

prognosis, as confirmed by other studies (Carro et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2006; TCGAConsortium, 2008). Integrative analysis of expression and mutational data (TCGAConsortium, 2008) produced a more complex stratification into proneural (PN), neural,
classic, and mesenchymal subtypes, as well an epigenetically distinct subtype (G-CIMP)
with best prognosis (Verhaak et al., 2010). While non-G-CIMP PN tumors were associated
with worst prognosis by (Brennan et al., 2013), MES-GBM tumors, based on the original
classification, present virtually indistinguishable prognosis and are ~7-fold more frequent
(Fig. S1). Thus the original MES-GBM and the newer Non-G-CIMP PN signatures are both
objective, equivalent markers of poor prognosis.
Among the genetic alterations reported by the TCGA Consortium (TCGA-Consortium,
2008), only NF1 mutations/deletions were associated with MES-GBM tumors (~25% of
samples) (Verhaak et al., 2010) while additional rare mutations and fusion events were
recently reported (Danussi et al., 2013; Frattini et al., 2013). Thus, despite multiple studies,
the genetic determinants of MES-GBM are still largely elusive and represent an ideal target
for the new algorithm.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In (Carro et al., 2010), we reported that aberrant co-activation of the transcription factors
(TFs) C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and STAT3 is necessary and sufficient to induce mesenchymal
reprogramming in GBM, suggesting that this TF-module represents an obligate pathway or
regulatory bottleneck between driver alterations and aberrant mesenchymal program
activity. We thus hypothesize that the genetic drivers of MES-GBM are either among these
genes or in their upstream pathways. Use of DIGGIT to test the hypothesis elucidated two
high-frequency alterations: focal amplification of C/EBPδ and homozygous deletion of
KLHL9, a Cullin E3 ligase adapter (Sumara et al., 2007).
To assess the algorithm’s generalizability to other diseases and germline variants, we also
applied it to breast cancer (BRCA) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This identified driver
alterations and variants missed by GWAS studies but validated by independent candidategene studies, as well as high-probability, yet unreported events.

RESULTS
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given a set of functional disease drivers, e.g., inferred by the Master Regulator Inference
algorithm (MARINa) (Aytes et al., 2014a; Carro et al., 2010), DIGGIT evaluates candidate
alterations in these genes and in their upstream regulators (see Fig. 1A for a flowchart). This
is accomplished by a 5-step process (Fig. 1B-1F), requiring a large set (N ≥ 200) of gene
expression profiles (henceforth GEPD) to assemble and analyze regulatory networks and a
large set (N ≥ 100) of sample-matched genetic variant profiles (henceforth GVPD). We first
discuss application of this pipeline to identify copy number variants (CNVs) that are causal
determinants of the MES-GBM subtype. We then perform additional analyses to show that
DIGGIT generalizes to the study of germline variants, as well as of other diseases, including
breast cancer and Alzheimer’s.

Step 1 (MR Analysis, Fig. 1B)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

This step requires a context-specific regulatory network representing TF → target
interactions (henceforth, interactome), and a gene expression signature of interest (i.e., a pvalue ranked list of differentially expressed genes) (input). These are analyzed by MARINa
to produce a p-value ranked list of candidate MRs (output). Given a GEPD dataset, networks
can be inferred using available reverse-engineering algorithms, such as ARACNe (Basso et
al., 2005). Specifically, MARINa analysis of an ARACNe-inferred GBM network, using a
MES-GBM signature identified six MR genes (MES-MRs), including C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ,
STAT3, BHLHB2, RUNX1, and FOSL2, including C/EBPβ/C/EBPδ and STAT3 as
synergistic MRs (Carro et al., 2010).
Step 2 (F-CNVG Analysis, Fig. 1C)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Functional alterations must induce aberrant activity of their gene products. Among copy
number alterations (CNVGs), we thus select those whose ploidy is informative of gene
expression as candidate functional CNVs (F-CNVGs) (Tamborero et al., 2013) (Fig. S1).
This is assessed based on (a) Mutual Information (MI) between copy number and expression
or (b) differential expression in WT vs. amplified/deleted samples (see Experimental
Methods). Analyses are performed on the GEPD and sample-matched GVPD profiles
(input), independent of subtype classification, to produce a p-value ranked list of candidate
F-CNVGs (output).
Analysis of 229 profile-matched GBM samples in TCGA identified 1,486 candidate FCNVGs (p ≤ 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). The MI test proved highly sensitive, accounting
for 90% of inferred F-CNVGs (Supplemental Tables) (both KLHL9 and C/EBPδ were
positive by MI analysis), with the T-test accounting for an additional 10% of low-frequency
F-CNVGs, with low MI analysis sensitivity.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Most CNVGs (94%) were discarded as not informative of gene expression (see Fig. S1),
suggesting no functional contribution. Conversely, inferred F-CNVGs included most genes
previously reported as GBM drivers (14/18, >88%) (TCGA-Consortium, 2008), including
EGFR, CDK4, PDGFRA, MDM2, MDM4, MET, AKT3, MYCN, PIK3CA, CDKN2A,
CDKN2C, RB1, PTEN, and NF1 (p = 1.2×10−10) (Supplemental Tables). Analysis of
remaining driver genes (CCND2, CDK6, CDKN2B, PARK2) revealed that they were missed
either due to low event frequency (CDK6<1.3%, CCND2<2.2%, PARK2<5.2%) or belowdetection gene expression levels (CDKN2B).
Among the MES-MRs, only C/EBPδ was inferred as a focally amplified F-CNVG (~22% of
samples), suggesting that aberrant activity of other MES-MRs may be mediated by
alterations in their upstream regulators.
Step 3 (MINDy Analysis, Fig. 1D)
Next, we interrogate pathways upstream of MR genes using the MINDy algorithm (Wang et
al., 2009). MINDy analyzes a large GEPD, the candidate MR list (Step-1), and the F-CNVG
list (Step-2) (input) to identify F-CNVGs that are candidate post-translational modulators of
MR-activity (independent of subtype classification), by Conditional Mutual Information

analysis (Wang et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2009), see Supplemental Methods. This generates a
p-value ranked list of candidate F-CNVGs in pathways upstream of MR genes (output). This
step dramatically reduced the 1,486 F-CNVGs from Step-1 to only 92 statistically
significant candidate MES-MR modulators; see Table S3.
Step 4 (aQTL Analysis, Fig. 1E)
F-CNVGs are then analyzed to identify those whose alteration is predictive of MR-activity,
similar to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) discovery (Yang et al., 2009). Activity
quantitative trait loci (aQTL) are inferred based on the statistical significance of the Mutual
Information between copy number and MR-activity. For each candidate F-CNVG, this is
computed using the MR-list (Step-1), the F-CNVG list (Step-2), the GEPD dataset, and the
interactome (input) to generate a p-value ranked list of candidate F-CNVG-aQTL (output).
Differential MR-activity is inferred from their differential target expression, using a singlesample version of MARINa (see Methods). This is critical, as MRs are frequently
differentially active but not differentially expressed (Aytes et al., 2014a; Carro et al., 2010).
Overall, 125 out of 1,486 F-CNVGs from Step-2 were inferred as aQTLs, including both C/
EBPδ and KLHL9 (Fig. 2A, Table S3).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Step 5 (Conditional Association Analysis, Fig. 1F)
MINDy and aQTL analyses are probabilistically integrated, using Fisher’s method, to
prioritize F-CNVGs for the final step. As shown by the 2-fold reduction in candidate FCNVGs (Table S3), these analyses provide largely statistically independent evidence.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CNVs can span multiple genes, resulting in statistical dependencies equivalent to linkage
disequilibrium (LD) in classical genetics. Indeed F-CNVG clustering by sample cosegregation identified 34 clusters (Fig. 2B), largely reflecting chromosomal proximity.
Conditional analysis helps assess whether association of a F-CNVG (fCNVi) with the
phenotype may be an artifact resulting from its physical proximity to a bona fide driver FCNVG (fCNVj), in which case conditional association of fCNVi with the phenotype (i.e.,
using only fCNVWT samples) should not be statistically significant, thus removing such
artifacts. This step requires MINDy/aQTL prioritized F-CNVGs (Step-3/4), a phenotypic
classifier, and the GEPD dataset (input) to produce a final p-value ranked list of candidate
driver F-CNVGs (output).
For MES-GBM, the 41 F-CNVGs inferred as significant from integrative MINDy/aQTL
analysis (Table S3) co-segregated into five distinct clusters: a 7-gene cluster (Chr. 5, 7, 8,
and 19) including the C/EBPδ locus; a 15-gene cluster (Chr. 9), including the KLHL9/
CDKN2A locus; a 11-gene cluster (Chr. 7), including the EGFR locus; a 5-gene cluster (Chr.
19); and a 3-gene cluster (Chr. 10) (see Fig. 2C and S3). The first cluster presented with a
highly unlikely co-segregation pattern distributed over four chromosomes (p = 9.5 × 10−12).
In addition, C/EBPS amplifications on chr-8 also co-segregated with NF1 point mutations,
whose association with the MES-GBM subtype was previously reported (Verhaak et al.,
2010). Since MINDy infers NF1 as a STAT3 but not a C/EBPβ/δ modulator and these
proteins cooperate synergistically to induce MES reprogramming, this suggests a possible
cooperative role of C/EBPδ and NF1 mutations. The 41 F-CNVGδ were tested for

conditional association to the MES subtype (Fig. 2C). Only C/EBPS and KLHL9 abrogated
association of all other F-CNVGδ, while remaining significant when conditioning on other
F-CNVGδ (see Fig. 2C and S3).
Conditional analysis discarded CDKN2A, a well-established tumor suppressor located
proximally to KLHL9, as candidate causal drivers of MES-GBM. Indeed, 85 samples with
homozygous CDKN2A deletions but an intact KLHL9 locus (iCDKN2A−/−-/KLHL9WT) were
not associated with MES-GBM. Conversely, 38 CDKN2A−/−-/KLHL9−/− samples
(excluding C/EBPδ amplifications to avoid confounding factors) were highly associated
with MES-GBM (p = 2.1 × 10−5), when compared to CDKN2A−/−/KLHL9WT samples.
Using a stringent call threshold, C/EBPδAmp and KLHL9−/− events account for 48% of
TCGA MES-GBM samples (Fig. 2D), with independent deletions/mutations of NF1
covering an additional 8%, suggesting that these may constitute the most common subtype
drivers. Table S3 summarizes the reduction in candidate F-CNVGδ resulting from each step
of the analysis.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Association of KLHL9 deletions is confirmed in an independent cohort—Since
C/EBPδ is a validated MES-MR (Carro et al., 2010), we focused on the functional
significance of homozygous KLHL9 deletions. First, we tested whether their association
with poor prognosis could be validated in an independent cohort. We analyzed 63 FFPEs,
representing 40 poor prognosis (survival < 35 weeks) and 23 good prognosis (survival > 130
weeks) GBM samples. Quantitative genomic PCR revealed higher frequency of
homozygous KLHL9 deletions in poor-prognosis (21/40) vs. good prognosis samples (4/23)
(p =0.006, by FET), Fig. 3A, 3B. This suggests an even higher frequency (>50%) than in
TCGA samples (38%). IHC staining of 10 KLHL9−/− and 10 KLHL9WT confirmed
association with aberrant C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ protein expression in vivo (odds ratio 12.25,
p = 0.028) (Fig. 3C). This confirms KLHL9−/− events as poor prognosis biomarkers and
their association with aberrant MES-MR activity in vivo. No KLHL9 missense or nonsense
mutations were detected.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

C/EBPδ and KLHL9 alterations are predictive of poor prognosis in multiple
tumors—Mesenchymal reprogramming is generally associated with poor outcome in
cancer (Thiery, 2002). We thus assessed whether C/EBPδAmp and KLHL9−/− events may be
predictive of poor prognosis in GBM and other tumors, independent of potentially
controversial subtype classification.
In GBM, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significantly worse prognosis for patients
harboring C/EBPδAmp and KLHL9−/− alterations, compared to either good prognosis (i.e.,
non-mesenchymal patients) (Fig. 3D, p = 3.5 ×10−4), or C/EBPδWT/KLHL9WT patients (Fig.
3D, p =0.03). None of the patients with these alterations survived longer than 36 weeks post
diagnosis (see vertical bars in Fig. 3D) and patients harboring both events had worst overall
prognosis, suggesting a cooperative effect. Thus, C/EBPδAmp and KLHL9−/− represent
genetic biomarkers of poor prognosis, independent of subtype classification.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Kaplan-Meier analysis of COSMIC (Forbes et al, 2008) and TCGA cohorts revealed that
KLHL9 homozygous deletions and missense/nonsense mutations are associated with worst
prognosis also in lung (LuAd) and ovarian (OvCa) adenocarcinomas (Fig. 3E, 3F), (p =1.8
×10−3) and p =0.04 respectively, independent of CDKN2A status. In OvCa, most KLHL9−/−
samples had no CDKN2A loss. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al.,
2005) confirmed aberrant C/EBPβ and/or C/EBPδ activity in KLHL9−/− samples, suggesting
a possible pan-cancer role of KLHL9 deletions via aberrant C/EBP activity (Fig. S4).
Ectopic KLHL9 expression in GBM cells abrogates C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ
abundance—To mechanistically elucidate KLHL9-mediated regulation of established
MES-MRs (C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and STAT3), we rescued KLHL9 expression in homozygously
deleted cells. Genomic analysis of a GBM cell line panel identified SF210 and SF763 cells
as KLHL9−/−;CDKN2A−/−;C/EBPWT.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Following inducible lentivirus-mediated rescue of KLHL9 expression in SF210 cells, two
independent clones (KLHL9–4 and KLHL9–7) showed stable KLHL9 levels by Western
blot, up to 96h post-induction (Fig. 4A, 4B). While C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ expression was not
significantly affected (Fig. 4C inset), RNA-Seq profiling revealed significant differential
expression of ARACNe-inferred C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ targets by GSEA (p = 0.004),
compared to controls (Fig. 4A), with significantly downregulation of established MES
markers: CHI3L1/YKL40, LIF, FOSL2, ACTA2, and FN1. Consistently, we observed
significant reduction in C/EBPδ and more modest decrease in C/EBPβ protein levels. Levels
of phospho-STAT3, representing the transcriptionally active isoform, were also reduced
(Fig. S5). These results were recapitulated in SF763 cells, with marked reduction of C/EBPδ
levels and more modest reduction of the C/EBPβ-LIP isoform in cells expressing KLHL9
relative to controls expressing RFP. Conversely, exogenous expression of P16/INK4A
(CDKN2A) in SF210 had no effect on either C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ protein expression or on the
MES signature genes (Fig. S5).
These results show that rescue of KLHL9 expression collapses the MES-GBM signature by
downregulating C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ at the protein level. This effect may be mediated by
ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation, as previously reported for the AuroraB kinase
(Fig. 4B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Proteasomal degradation of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ depends on KLHL9-mediated
poly-ubiquitylation—Given KLHL9’s putative function as an adaptor of Cul3-based E3
ubiquitin ligase (Sumara et al., 2007), we tested its role in mediating poly-ubiquitylationdependent proteasomal degradation of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. Direct physical interaction
between KLHL9 and both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ proteins was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 5A). We then measured degradation and relative half-life
of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ following rescue of KLHL9 expression in SF210 (Fig. 5B). C/EBPβ
and C/EBPδ levels were significantly reduced at 4h following ectopic KLHL9 expression
and cycloheximide-mediated inhibition of protein translation (Fig. 5B). Finally, MG-132mediated proteasome inhibition abrogated C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ degradation, confirming that
KLHL9 is required for their proteasomal processing. A more detailed time-course revealed a

~2h half life for these proteins following KLHL9 rescue (Fig. S6), compared to KLHL9−/−
controls where they were stable beyond 4h.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

KLHL9 mediates poly-ubiquitylation of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ isoforms—To
determine whether proteasomal degradation of C/EBPs depends on KLHL9-mediated
interaction with the CUL3 E3 ligase complex, we collected cell lysates following rescue of
KLHL9 expression and MG-132 treatment to test for ubiquitylated species. Indeed, C/EBPβ
and C/EBPδ poly-ubiquitylated isoforms increased significantly following KLHL9 rescue,
compared to controls (Fig. 5C). Reciprocal assays confirmed this result (Fig. S6).
Finally, to confirm that KLHL9-mediated C/EBP regulation depends on a functional
KLHL9-CUL3 E3 ligase complex, we cloned a mutant KLHL9 isoform with a 70aa deletion
of its N-terminal BTB domain. This domain is required for ligase/target complex
recruitment to the cullin scaffold, which mediates ubiquitin transfer to the target substrate
(Xu et al., 2003). Expression of mutant KLHL9 abrogated poly-ubiquitylation of both C/EBP
proteins in SF210 cells (Fig. 5D), resulting in half-lives comparable to control KLHL9−/−
cells.

KLHL9 expression delays exit from S-phase in glioma cells—To study the
functional consequences of KLHL9 deletion, we performed stable infection with KLHL9 or
control expression constructs in SF210 and SF763 cells, for cell cycle analysis. As
previously reported (Rutka et al., 1987), both cell lines are polyploid and aneuploid, with the
majority of the cells found as tetraploid (Fig. S7). Rescue of KLHL9 expression resulted in
decreased growth rates in both cell lines, with a more pronounced effect in SF210 (Fig. 6A
and S7). C/EBPδ protein levels decreased in both cell lines after KHLH9 infection, and C/
EBPβ isoform levels decreased in the SF210 line (Fig. 6B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were then synchronized by serum-free starvation for 48h, released in regular media,
and analyzed at selected time points with BrdU. We observed a constant increase in cell
number in S-phase in KHLH9-expressing SF210 cells relative to controls (Fig. 6C). BrdU
labeling revealed active S-phase at both 4h and 8h in KLHL9-expressing SF210 cells,
compared to only 4h in control cells (Fig. 6D). SF763 cells also showed delayed entry into
S-phase (at 4h compared with 2h in the control) and exited from S-phase only by 8h.
However, while control cells re-entered S-phase by 8h, KHLH9-expressing cells did not,
suggesting overall slowing of cell cycle progression, consistent with observed growth curves
(Fig. 6A & S7). Finally, Western blot analysis of synchronized KLHL9-expressing cells also
showed different kinetics for C/EBP isoforms, variable levels of AURKB, and higher levels
of cyclin A and p21 protein expression. Taken together, our data suggest that rescue of
KLHL9 expression delays the cell cycle by imposing a late S/G2 checkpoint.
KLHL9 expression in KLHL9 −/− patient-derived GBM tumors reduces growth
in orthotopic xenografts—To test whether the in vitro effects of KLHL9 rescue were
recapitulated in vivo, we identified a patient derived xenograft (PDX) model of
KLHL9−/−GBM (HF2354), classified as a MES-GBM tumor by RNA-Seq profile analysis.
The overall workflow of this experiment is outlined in Fig. 7A. The PDX model originated
from a primary GBM tumor sample that was serially passaged in mice. We exogenously

rescued expression of KLHL9 in HF2354 via stable infection with pLOC-KLHL9 or pLOCRFP vectors. 96h after lentivirus infection, cells were orthotopically implanted in two 7mouse cohorts. All 14 mice were observed daily and euthanized simultaneously at the first
sign of distress (per IACUC protocol). Their brains were formalin fixed, breadloaffed, and
paraffin embedded for histological assessment and IHC.
Face cuts from the blocks were H&E stained for tumor identification and scored by a boardcertified pathologist, from 0 [no tumor cells present in any sections] to 3 [major portion of
hemisphere occupied by tumor]. Rescue of KLHL9 expression in HF2354 cells significantly
impaired tumor growth compared to RFP-expressing controls (Fig. 7B), resulting in
significant reduction in overall tumor mass (p = 0.04). The presence of some tumor cells was
reported even in the absence of an expanding mass. As such, these values and associated pvalue constitute an overly cautious interpretation of the assay.
These experiments show that in vitro cell-cycle dependent reduction in proliferative
potential, induced by ectopic KLHL9 expression in human cell cultures, is recapitulated in
vivo and induces retardation in tumor growth.

Unbiased inference of driver alterations in breast cancer and Alzheimer’s
disease—To test whether DIGGIT could be generalized to study different disease models
and germline variants, we performed full analysis (Steps 1–5) of sample-matched CNV/
expression data from the TCGA breast cancer (BRCA) cohort (TCGA-Consortium, 2012),
and of sample-matched SNP/expression data from a recent integrative study of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) (Zhang et al., 2013).
BRCA is a well-studied cancer with many established oncogenic drivers that have been
functionally or mechanistically validated. We thus first performed a literature search to
identify a repertoire of validated CNV alterations linked to BRCA tumorigenesis. The
analysis revealed a set of 25 alterations, which are reported in Table S4, together with
appropriate references. We then performed DIGGIT and GWAS analyses using TCGA data,
naïve to these publications.

To identify candidate MR genes for BRCA, we first generated tumorigenic signatures for
each tumor sample by differential expression analysis against the set of TCGA normal breast
tissues. We then analyzed each signature using the single-sample MARINa algorithm,
ssMARINa (see methods and (Aytes et al., 2014b)), to select the 10 most frequently inferred
MRs. This effectively avoids bias from breast cancer subtype stratification, while still
supporting identification of subtype-specific MRs. We chose the top 10 MR, because in
previous studies, 50% to 70% of top MRs were experimentally validated. Using more MRs
would thus decrease the specificity of MINDy and aQTL analyses without improving
sensitivity. The optimal number of MRs for the analysis may need to be selected on a caseby-case basis.
Following candidate F-CNVGs analysis, integration of MINDy and aQTL results yielded
122 statistically significant F-CNVGs (FDR ≤ 0.05), of which 35 were selected by
conditional association analysis. Of these, 19 (76%) could be matched in the 25-gene

literature compiled list (Supplemental Table 4); yet only 5 of them were statistically
significant by GWAS, while the remaining 14 were missed (FDR = 1). Finally, 6 literaturederived events were missed by DIGGIT: two could not be identified as MINDy modulators
of top 10 MARINa-inferred MRs, while four were not statistically significant by aQTL
analysis. A summary of this analysis is provided in Supplemental Table 4.

Analysis of an Alzheimer’s disease cohort, using patient-matched, brain gene expression and
genotypic profiles from affected and non-affected individuals, identified TYROBP as a
candidate germline determinant of the disease (Zhang et al., 2013). We downloaded the
publicly available data used in these analyses and performed unbiased DIGGIT analysis,
naïve to the published results. Since this analysis was based on single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP), we modified Step-2 to identify candidate 𝓕-SNPs by selecting those
within 1kb of a corresponding gene’s coding region (see Supplemental Methods). Similar to
BRCA analysis, we used ssMARINa to identify the 10 most frequent MRs (See Methods).
DIGGIT identified 112 𝓕-SNPs, with 63 passing MINDy/aQTL integration and 13 also
significant by conditional association analysis. Among these, TYROBP was ranked 1st (p =
4.2 × 10 −47), achieving higher significance than even APOE, ranked 9th (p = 2.0× 10 −21)
(see Supplemental Tables S5 and S6). An additional candidate SNP identified in the original
publication (FCER1G) was ranked 8th (p = 9.1 × 10 −22) by our analysis.

DISCUSSION
Following ten years of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), elucidating the repertoire
of causal genetic determinants of most complex diseases has proven more challenging than
expected. Due to the large number of candidate loci, it is difficult to achieve the statistical
power to detect all but the most highly penetrant and frequent events. Furthermore, when
relevant genetic determinants emerge from these analyses, their mechanistic validation may
lag by decades. At the other end of the spectrum, candidate-gene based biochemical studies
can provide insight into causal regulatory mechanisms but do not effectively scale up to
genome-wide coverage, due to their time consuming and laborious nature.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To address both challenges we introduced DIGGIT, a novel algorithm for the network-based
elucidation of genetic determinants of human disease, resulting in dramatic reduction of
testable hypotheses and availability of regulatory clues to guide mechanistic validation. The
key algorithm’s requirement is a large repertoire of sample-matched gene expression and
genetic variant profiles. As such, it is directly applicable to many tumor contexts and to an
increasing number of germline diseases and traits.
The specific genetic etiology of most diseases is highly heterogeneous and thus largely
patient-specific. Yet, we hypothesize that diverse alteration patterns induce common
aberrant signals, converging on regulatory modules and associated MR proteins that
represent key regulatory bottlenecks, whose dysregulation is both necessary and sufficient
for disease initiation/progression. The existence and role of MR proteins and modules
representing regulatory bottlenecks has been demonstrated in a variety of tumor contexts
(Aytes et al., 2014a; Carro et al., 2010; Chudnovsky et al., 2014; Compagno et al., 2009; De
Keersmaecker et al., 2010; Della Gatta et al., 2012; Lefebvre et al., 2010; Lim et al., 2009;

Piovan et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2009). Once identified, however, it is reasonable to assume
that driver genetic events must be harbored either by these MRs or by their upstream
pathways.
The mesenchymal subtype of GBM, representative of poor prognosis, provides an ideal
context to test this rationale, as its established genetic determinants account for <25% of the
patients. Starting from previously established MES-GBM MRs (Carro et al., 2010), DIGGIT
identified C/EBPδ amplifications and KLHL9 deletions as novel, causal determinants of
aberrant MES-GBM MR activity. We confirmed KLHL9 deletions in an independent cohort
and showed that this protein is necessary for Cul3-ligase mediated ubiquitylation and
proteasomal degradation of established MES-GBM MRs, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ.
Interestingly, only one MES-MRs (C/EBPδ) harbored driver alterations, suggesting that
typical MARINa-inferred MRs represent non-oncogene dependencies of cancer cells (Luo et
al., 2009; Schreiber et al., 2010), as also confirmed by additional studies (Aytes et al.,
2014a; Carro et al., 2010; Chudnovsky et al., 2014; Compagno et al., 2009; Lim et al., 2009;
Piovan et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2009).

Initial evidence supporting the existence of regulatory bottlenecks that integrate aberrant
signals from multiple mutations to implement a common disease phenotype, first emerged in
earlier studies of Nf-κB as non-oncogene dependency in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
Mutations in several BCR pathway genes (e.g., TNFAIP3, CARD11, MYD88, etc.) elicited
dependency on Nf-κB, even though its subunits were not mutated (Compagno et al., 2009;
Davis et al., 2001). More recent examples of MARINa-inferred non-oncogene dependencies
include AKT1 as a MR of glucocorticoid resistance in TALL, downstream of PTEN and
PI3K mutations (Piovan et al., 2013) and FOXM1 and CENPF as synergistic MRs of
aggressive prostate cancer (Aytes et al., 2014a), downstream of several genetic and
epigenetic alterations, currently undergoing experimental validation. Thus, while regulatory
bottlenecks may not represent a universal mechanism in cancer, when present, they can
substantially contribute to identification of driver alterations. Additionally, canalization of
aberrant signals from genetic events in upstream pathways is not necessarily restricted to
cancer. Indeed, we showed that DIGGIT could be successfully applied to elucidating genetic
determinants of Alzheimer’s disease risk. Specifically, to show that the algorithm can be
applied to multiple disease contexts driven by either somatic alterations or germline variants,
we showed that DIGGIT could successfully identify 19 established CNV drivers of breast
ductal adenocarcinoma and 3 established risk alleles for Alzheimer’s disease, as well as
several novel, high-probability alterations and variants that deserve further experimental
testing. Critically, the vast majority of these events could not be identified by GWAS.
The ability to interrogate de novo reverse-engineered networks upstream of established
functional regulators has several implications. First, it forgoes the need to evaluate each
locus in the genome as an equivalent candidate driver, which incurs a statistical cost that
greatly reduces the power of current GWAS methods. This is especially critical when
multiple low-penetrance or low-frequency events converge on the same functional regulator,
or when genetic alterations may have epistatic/synergistic effects. For instance, the dramatic
reduction in candidate driver alterations afforded by DIGGIT allowed efficient use of
conditional association methods to further distinguish driver from passenger alterations and

to discover candidate co-dependent events, such as independent events in C/EBPδ and NF1.
Second, discovery of genetic drivers upstream of MRs previously established as therapeutic
targets are likely to provide valuable genetic biomarkers for targeted therapeutic
intervention. Finally, MR-based discovery of genetic alterations may help identify
alterations that are either not focal (e.g., in large amplicons) or that are masked by close
proximity to well-established oncogenes and tumor suppressors that would likely prevent
their identification, as was the case for the homozygous KLHL9 deletions.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

With respect to the specific finding in GBM, our results implicate KLHL9 deletions as
mechanistic MES-GBM drivers, by abrogating ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation
of two MR proteins, C\EBPβ and C/EBPδ, and by increasing levels of phosphorylatedSTAT3. At least two other genes coding for E3 ubiquitin ligases were reported to undergo
loss-of-function genetic alterations in GBM. The first one codes for FBW7, an F-box protein
of the SCF complex that is mutated in several forms of human cancer including GBM
(Thompson et al., 2007). FBW7 mutations stabilize the oncoprotein substrates CCNE1,
MYC and NOTCH1 (Nakayama and Nakayama, 2006). The second one, encoding an E3
ligase that is deleted in GBM, is HUWE1, a Hect-domain ubiquitin ligase that triggers
initiation of differentiation and loss of self-renewal in the developing brain by targeting the
MYCN oncoprotein for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (Zhao et al., 2009). Our findings
indicate that loss-of-function events targeting E3 ubiquitin ligases such as KLHL9 in human
cancer not only promote aberrant stabilization of classical oncoproteins, but can also trigger
accumulation of key transcription factors responsible for tumor lineage reprogramming.
Finally, the ability to identify both cancer bottlenecks and their candidate upstream
functional regulators depends critically on the availability of sample-matched geneexpression/genetic-variant profiles and accurate and comprehensive repertoires of cellcontext specific molecular interactions (interactomes). While the assembly of integrated
transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational interactomes is still in its infancy,
the genome-wide integration of experimental and computational approaches is already
starting to provide biologically relevant models. This further suggests that network-based
methodologies may be increasingly valuable entries in the toolkit for the identification and
mechanistic elucidation of genetic determinants of physiological and disease-related
phenotypes, using ever-increasing volumes of genomic data.

Inference of Functional CNV Genes (F-CNVG)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Each F-CNVG (FCi) is assessed based on the statistical significance of the Mutual
Information (MI), IF[CNVi;mRNAi], where mRNAi represents its expression and CNVi its
copy number across a sample-matched cohort. Thresholds for CNV calling are assessed
from the distribution in control samples. The DIGGIT package includes the .fCNV function
to measure MI using a fixed-bandwidth Gaussian Kernel estimator and false discovery rate
(FDR), by gene-shuffling, to assess statistical significance. Low-frequency alterations,
occurring in fewer than 7 samples (thus not appropriate for MI analysis) are tested for
differential expression in altered vs. WT samples via T-test or Z-test.
MINDy and aQTL-analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MINDy—Use of the algorithm to generate a list of candidate MR modulators is fully
discussed in the Supplemental Information and in (Wang et al., 2009). aQTL: For each FCNVG (FC), the .aQTL function is used to compute MIaQTL[CNVi;MRj], i.e., the MI
between its copy number (CNVi) and the ssMARINa-inferred activity of each MES-MR
protein (MRj) to assess the aQTL p-value. MES-GBM MRs included: C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ,
STAT3, FOSL2, BHLHB2, and RUNX1, see (Carro et al., 2010). The aQTL and MINDy pvalues are integrated by Fisher’s method, implemented in the .integrate function.
F-CNVG Clustering and Conditional Association (CA)
Clustering—The .cluster function is used to tests each 𝓕-CNVG pair for same-sample
co-occurrence by pairwise FET; amplifications and deletions are tested separately. Clusters
include all gene pairs with statistically significant association.
Conditional Association—For each 𝓕-CNVG pair (FCi,FCi) in a cluster, the .ca
function is used to test whether FCi is no longer significantly associated with the target
phenotype (i.e., MES-GBM) when samples with FCj alterations are removed. Each
candidate FCi is given a score, SCA by counting the number of 𝓕-CNVGs in the cluster
whose association with the phenotype is abrogated when conditioning on FCi, minus the
number of 𝓕-CNVGs for which FCi’s association is abrogated. E.g., KLHL9 abrogated
MES-GBM association of 14 out of 14 other 𝓕-CNVGs in cluster 2. Conversely, KLHL9’s
association was never abrogated by these 𝓕-CNVGs (SCA = 14 – 0 = 14)

Classification of TCGA GBM tumors
We classified all TCGA GBM tumor samples into MES, PN, or PRO, per the original
definition (Phillips et al., 2006). The three genes with the highest variance across the cohort
in this work were used for classification including: SERPINE1, CHI3L1, TIMP1 (MES);
BCAN, OLIG2, KLRC3 (PN); and HMMR, TOP2A, PCNA (PRO). TCGA samples were
classified based on these markers, by unsupervised k-means clustering (available in the
Bioconductor R package).
Orthotopic xenograft mouse models

Female nude mice (Age 4–5 week) were randomized into groups of 7 that received either
HF2354 cells transduced with a control vector or a vector expressing KLHL9. At 96h
following lentivirus-mediated transduction, cells were injected into the right basal ganglia
using a small animal stereotaxic frame (TSE Systems). Mice were weighed daily and
observed for the onset of neurologic symptoms or distress. When the first mouse from either
study cohort was euthanized due to neurological symptoms or distress, all other mice in both
cohorts were euthanized and formalin-perfused brains were harvested and embedded in
paraffin. Immunohistochemistry and H&E staining were performed and a board certified
pathologist scored the sections: 0, no tumor; 1, small tumor or presence of dispersed tumor
cells in any tissue section; 2, medium size tumor; 3, large tumor occupying major areas of
the hemisphere.

bona-fide causal driver alteration. (C) Step 2F-CNVGs are determined by association
analysis of copy number and gene-expression (see methods), thus removing a large number
of genes whose expression is not affected by ploidy. The insert shows two examples: (a) An
example of no dependency between copy number and expression and not selected as a
candidate F-CNVG, and (b) an example with highly significant dependency and thus
selected as a candidate F-CNVG (D) Step 3: MINDy analysis identifies F-CNVGs that are
candidate modulators of MR-activity (shown as yellow circles), by computing the
Conditional Mutual Information I[MR;T|M], where M is a candidate modulator gene and T
is an ARACNe-inferred MR-target gene. Blue arrows represent physical signal transduction
interactions upstream of the MR. Green arrows represent one specific M→MR→T triplet
tested by MINDy, as an illustrative example. Note that MINDy does not infer the blue
arrows but only the fact that a protein is an upstream modulator of MR activity. (E) Step 4:
aQTL analysis identifies F-CNVGs (shown as white circles), whose alterations cosegregates with aberrant MR-activity, as computed from MR-target expression and shown
by the blue arrows. The insert shows details of this analysis. The vertical gradient rectangle
shows all genes sorted from the most overexpressd (red) to the most underexpressed (blue),
when comparing samples with copy number alterations in a gene (Gene ×) (thick red lines)
to WT samples (thin black lines). If MR-targets significantly co-segregate with the
differential expression signature (i.e., if positively regulated and repressed MR targets,
shown as red and blue bars, are over and under expressed, respectively, as shown), then
Gene × alterations are likely to affect MR-activity. (F) Step 5: Finally, conditional
association analysis identifies F-CNVGs that abrogate all other associations with the
phenotype (e.g., the MES-GBM subtype) when samples harboring their alterations are
removed from the analysis. Each cell shows the statistical significance of the association
between the i-th gene (rows) and the phenotype of interest (as a heatmap), when considering
only samples that have no alterations in the j-th gene (columns). For instance, when
conditioning on G3, no other gene is significantly associated with the subtype, while G3 is
still significantly associated with the subtype when conditioning on G1, G2, or G4. This
suggests that G3 is a bona fide driver gene.

Figure 2. DIGGIT integrative analysis infers candidate MES-GBM driver mutations

(A) DIGGIT analysis of pathways upstream of MES-GBM MRs identifies CEBPδ
amplification and KLHL9 deletions as candidate genetic determinants of the GBM-MES
subtype. p-values shown represent the integrated p-value of the aQTL and MINDy steps, as
defined in Figure 1. (B) co-mutated F-CNVGs are shown as a network, with distance
between connected nodes inversely proportional to the statistical significance of their cosegregation, as assessed by Fisher’s Exact Test (FET). Only statistically significant pairs are
shown (p = 0.05, corrected), with amplifications and deletions represented as blue and red
