Abstract
An increasing amount of experimental evidence shows that
microRNAs can have a causal role in breast cancer tumorigenesis as a novel class of oncogenes or tumor suppressor
genes, depending on the targets they regulate. HER2 overexpression is a hallmark of a particularly aggressive subset of
breast tumors, and its activation is strictly dependent on the
trans-interaction with other members of HER family; in
particular, the activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway,
so critically important in tumorigenesis, is predominantly
driven through phosphorylation of the kinase-inactive member HER3. Here, we show that miR-205, down-modulated in
breast tumors compared with normal breast tissue, directly
targets HER3 receptor, and inhibits the activation of the
downstream mediator Akt. The reintroduction of miR-205 in
SKBr3 cells inhibits their clonogenic potential and increases
the responsiveness to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors Gefitinib and
Lapatinib, abrogating the HER3-mediated resistance and
restoring a potent proapoptotic activity. Our data describe
miR-205 as a new oncosuppressor gene in breast cancer, able
to interfere with the proliferative pathway mediated by HER
receptor family. Our study also provides experimental
evidence suggesting that miR-205 can improve the responsiveness to specific anticancer therapies. [Cancer Res 2009;
69(6):2195–200]

Introduction
In the last few years, an increasing amount of experimental
evidence has strongly supported the involvement of microRNAs,
highly conserved small noncoding RNAs able to regulate gene
expression at posttranscriptional level, in the biology of human
cancer. Several studies have indeed described the aberrant
expression of microRNAs in human tumors (1) and have
investigated their potential role as oncogenes or tumor suppressor
genes, depending on the targets they regulate (2–4).
In the genome-wide miR expression profile of human breast
cancer we published in 2005 (5), we identified a number of
microRNAs that have been later confirmed to play a crucial role in
the biology of human breast cancer (6): one of the first microRNAs

identified as putative oncogene, miR-21, overexpressed in breast
cancer, promotes cell proliferation and survival targeting TPM1
and PDCD4 (7, 8); miR-10b is associated with metastatic potential
(9); miR-125a and miR-125b, down-regulated in breast cancer, are
able to target ERBB2 and ERBB3 receptors (10).
MiR-205, which we initially found associated with absence of
vascular invasion in breast cancer (5), was then investigated by
in situ hybridization by Sempere and colleagues (11), who
described that miR-205 expression is restricted to normal
myoepithelial cells, whereas its expression is reduced or completely
eliminated in matching tumor specimens. More recently, miR-205
and miR-200 family have been shown to regulate epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (12).
Searching for putative targets of miR-205 by in silico analysis,
we found HER3 tyrosine-protein kinase receptor. Members of
human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; HER) family are
involved in tumorigenesis when their signaling functions are
deregulated. In particular, it is known that in breast cancer,
HER2 overexpression is a hallmark of a particularly aggressive
subset of tumors (13, 14). Lacking a ligand-binding activity,
HER2 activation is strictly dependent on the trans-interaction
with other members of the HER family; in particular, the
activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway, so critically
important in tumorigenesis, is for the most part driven through
phosphorylation of the kinase-inactive member HER3. HER3 plays
an important and necessary function in HER2-mediated tumorigenesis and coexpression of the two members of the family is a
poor prognostic factor.
Thus, given the importance of HER3 receptor in survival and
proliferation of breast cancer cells, and the evidence suggesting the
involvement of miR-205 in breast cancer, we investigated a possible
regulation on this protein by miR-205.
Indeed, here, we show that miR-205, negatively regulating HER3,
is able to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation and improves the
response to specific targeted therapies.

Results and Discussion
miR-205 directly targets HER3 in breast cancer cells.
According to our breast cancer miR signature (5) and recent
studies published by other groups, miR-205 seemed to be an
interesting candidate for its involvement in breast cancer. To
validate the down-modulation of miR-205 in breast tumors
compared with normal breast tissue, we first performed a
Northern blot on a panel of breast tumor specimens (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Among the potential mRNAs targeted by miR-205, identified
using the miRGen database4 (17), we selected HER3 receptor,
known to play a crucial role in breast cancer development. HER3 is
indeed frequently up-modulated in breast cancer with EGFR or
HER2 overexpression, and it has been shown that it synergistically
increases the transforming potency of HER2 (18). Evaluating miR205 and HER3 expression in a panel of breast carcinoma
specimens, we observed an inversed correlation (Supplementary
Fig. S2), suggestive of a possible regulation of HER3 exerted by
miR-205. To experimentally validate this hypothesis, we first
investigated the modulation of HER3 protein levels in SKBr3 and
MCF7 breast cancer cells transfected with miR-205 precursor
molecule or a scrambled oligonucleotide by Western blot. Overexpression of miR-205 (verified by Northern blot in Supplementary
Fig. S3 and real-time PCR in Fig. 1A) decreased HER3 protein
expression of f44% and 30% in SKBr3 and MCF7, respectively,
as evaluated by densitometric analysis (Fig. 1B).
Considering that miRs are thought to control gene expression
by base pairing with specific recognizing elements in their target
messenger, we performed a luciferase reporter assay to verify that a
direct interaction between miR-205 and HER3-3¶UTR was responsible for the decreased expression of HER3 protein. 1251 bp of
HER3 3¶UTR, including the binding site for miR-205 (Fig. 1C), were
inserted downstream of the luciferase open reading frame in the
reporter plasmid. The reporter vector was cotransfected in HEK293
cells with miR-205 precursor molecule or a scrambled oligonucle-

otide as negative control, and the luciferase activity was markedly
decreased (57% reduction) after miR-205 overexpression (P = 0.001;
Fig. 1D). Moreover, the mutation of the miR-205 binding site in
HER3-3¶UTR prevented the down-regulation of luciferase expression, supporting the evidence that the effect of the microRNA is
exerted through direct interaction with the mRNA target, and that
the ‘‘seed site’’ at the 5¶ end of the microRNA is necessary for the
binding.
miR-205 interferes with the survival pathway downstream of
HER3. The primary oncogenic signaling induced by the heterodimer HER2-HER3, and directly mediated through HER3, is the
activation of PI3K/Akt survival pathway. Because HER3 was
directly targeted by miR-205, we investigated whether it was able
to interfere with the proliferation/survival pathways activated
downstream of HER receptor activation. As reported in Fig. 2,
transfection of miR-205 molecule in SKBr3 cells clearly decreased
the levels of phosphorylated AKT compared with a scrambled
oligonucleotide. Instead, we observed only a slight reduction in
phospho-MAPK levels.
miR-205 inhibits breast cancer cell growth. Because miR-205
was able to impair the activation of the Akt-mediated survival and
proliferation pathway, it was of high interest and priority to assess
whether this microRNA had a functional effect on breast cancer
cell growth. To address this, we performed a colony forming assay
on SKBr3 breast cancer cells transfected with the plasmid encoding
miR-205 (Vec-miR-205) or the corresponding empty vector (miRVec). As parallel control, we directly knocked down HER3
transfecting a plasmid encoding a specific shRNA (shRNA-HER3)
or the corresponding empty vector (sh-RNA-CTR; Western blot

showing HER3 silencing in Supplementary Fig. S4). After 3 weeks
of antibiotic selection, we stained the culture dishes and evaluated
the number of colonies; as shown in Fig. 3, transfection with
miR-205 (Fig. 3A) consistently decreased the ability to form
colonies, revealing an inhibitory effect even greater than what was
obtained with the shRNA (Fig. 3B; f55% inhibition versus 36%).
At a molecular level, miR-205 overexpression, verified by realtime PCR (Fig. 3C), decreased the quantity of total HER3 protein,
causing a reduction also in P-HER3 and P-AKT levels (Fig. 3D).
The fact that we did not detect any modification in HER2 protein
level supports the hypothesis that the observed cell growth
inhibition mediated by miR-205 is exerted through specific HER3
repression.
miR-205 enforced expression increases the responsiveness
to Gefitinib and Lapatinib. The control exerted by miR-205 on
HER3-mediated survival pathway also raised the intriguing
possibility of a role of this microRNA in the responsiveness to
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies in breast cancer. Recent
findings have indeed unraveled a critical role exerted by the

inactive protein kinase HER3 in the development of resistance
to HER TKIs such as Gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor, and the EGFR/
HER2-selective inhibitor Lapatinib. It has been postulated that the
persistent activation of AKT pathway, only transiently suppressed by
TKIs, could contribute to mediating this effect (19). Recent studies
have also shown that siRNA-mediated HER3 inhibition can impair
the reactivation of Akt-mediated pathway, thus averting the escape
from TKIs therapy (20). Therefore, HER3 is a much more suitable
biomarker to guide TKI treatments efficacy, but, at the same time,
it also represents a challenging target for pharmaceuticals.
To determine whether miR-205, targeting HER3 protein and able
to inhibit AKT phosphorylation, could contribute to TKI responsiveness, we transiently transfected SKBr3 cells for 72 hours with
100 nmol/L pre–miR-205, compared with a negative control, and
then treated with 0.5 Amol/L Gefitinib or 0.25 Amol/L Lapatinib for
an additional 72 hours, evaluating then the percentage of apoptotic
cells. As a parallel control, we directly silenced HER3 transfecting a
specific siRNA. As shown in Fig. 4, forced expression of miR-205
and siRNA-mediated HER3 silencing induced, respectively, f57%

and 60% increase in sensitivity to 0.5 Amol/L Gefitinib (Fig. 4A),
and 48% and 87% to 0.25 Amol/L Lapatinib (Fig. 4B).
To support the hypothesis that the increased responsiveness to
TKIs treatment was due to the ability of miR-205 to repress the
HER3-mediated pathway, counteracting the reactivation of Akt
signaling, we analyzed HER3, p-HER3, p-AKT, and total AKT
levels at 48 hours of drugs treatment; as supposed, in miR-205
or siRNA-HER3–transfected cells, total HER3, P-HER3, and P-Akt
levels are lower than the corresponding control cells (Supplementary Fig. S5).
In summary, in this work, we describe miR-205 as a new
oncosuppressor gene in breast cancer, able to interfere with the
proliferative pathway mediated by the HER receptor family. Our
study also provides experimental evidence that miR-205 can
improve the responsiveness to TKI treatment, raising the
intriguing possibility of using this microRNA as a new biomarker
