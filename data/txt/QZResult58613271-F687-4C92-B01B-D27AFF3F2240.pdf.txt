ABSTRACT:
This study reports on probing the utility of in situ chromatin texture features such
as nuclear DNA methylation and chromatin condensation patterns — visualized by
fluorescent staining and evaluated by dedicated three-dimensional (3D) quantitative
and high-throughput cell-by-cell image analysis — in assessing the proliferative
capacity, i.e. growth behavior of cells: to provide a more dynamic picture of a cell
population with potential implications in basic science, cancer diagnostics/prognostics
and therapeutic drug development. Two types of primary cells and four different
cancer cell lines were propagated and subjected to cell-counting, flow cytometry,
confocal imaging, and 3D image analysis at various points in culture. Additionally
a subset of primary and cancer cells was accelerated into senescence by oxidative
stress. DNA methylation and chromatin condensation levels decreased with declining
doubling times when primary cells aged in culture with the lowest levels reached
at the stage of proliferative senescence. In comparison, immortal cancer cells with
constant but higher doubling times mostly displayed lower and constant levels of
the two in situ-derived features. However, stress-induced senescent primary and
cancer cells showed similar levels of these features compared with primary cells
that had reached natural growth arrest. With regards to global DNA methylation and
chromatin condensation levels, aggressively growing cancer cells seem to take an
intermediate level between normally proliferating and senescent cells. Thus, normal
cells apparently reach cancer-cell equivalent stages of the two parameters at some
point in aging, which might challenge phenotypic distinction between these two types
of cells. Companion high-resolution molecular profiling could provide information on
possible underlying differences that would explain benign versus malign cell growth
behaviors.

INTRODUCTION

sequence, collectively termed epigenetic signatures,
of which the currently most popularly investigated are
differential DNA methylation, histone modifications, and
micro RNA (miRNA) display. All three modalities may
influence chromatin conformation in mammalian cells:
both, locally for regulating site-specific gene expression
and globally to modulate the plasticity of the higher-order

Cells that share the same genotype, may not
necessarily present the same phenotype, including
structural and functional properties that can be assayed
with a plethora of existing technologies. The differences
largely arise from layers of information beyond the DNA

organization of the genome [1-3]. Particularly, changes
in DNA methylation patterns have been associated with
the progression of cells during differentiation [4-7] as
well as the etiology and pathology of complex traits
[8,9]. Differences in DNA methylation patterns between
normal and cancer cells have been well documented
[10-12]. Cancer cells usually display hypermethylation
of a relatively small number of single gene promoters
mostly in gene-rich genomic regions termed CpGislands, leading to silencing of certain tumor suppressors
involved in cell-cycle regulation, DNA mismatch repair,
cellular differentiation, and apoptosis. This phenomenon
is often coexistent with hypomethylation at the global
DNA (gDNA) level, a large portion of which occurs in
repetitive elements; potentially inducing activation of
latent retrotransposons with the consequence of genomewide mutations and genome instability [13] alongside
with substantial spatial reorganization of chromatin in cell
nuclei, which can be visualized by light microscopy [14–
18]. This differential topology can be also be triggered by
exposing cells to strong demethylating agents [19,20].
Recent advancements in cellular imaging and
computational image analysis have made it feasible for
large volumes of images to be analyzed in relatively short
amount of time at substantially lower costs, compared to
genome-wide molecular assays such as DNA microarrays
and massively-parallel sequencing, when being performed
at the single-cell level. Even though these techniques
are rapidly improving in sensitivity towards single-cell
resolution and becoming gradually miniaturized and
automated, still two factors will remain for a while, which
attenuate their use in a cell-by-cell mode: a) the high
cost accumulation, and b) the computational complexity
for data interpretation. Furthermore, imaging modalities
have the advantage of interrogating cells in their native
environment, thus adding contextual information to
subcellular structure analysis. Therefore, we need to
appreciate affordable technologies that provide high
statistical values and acknowledge cellular heterogeneity.
With regard to that, 3D quantitative DNA methylation
imaging (3D-qDMI) has been particularly developed
as a tool towards the causal assessment of global DNA
demethylation,
heterochromatin
decondensation,
and relevant genome reorganization in cell nuclei to
characterize cells in response to environmental changes,
for directed differentiation of stem cells and therapeutic
reprogramming by demethylating agents [18–24]. The
effects are measured through in situ analysis of nuclear
structures (chromatin texture) representing methylated
CG-dinucleotides (MeC) and gDNA, which are delineated
by fluorescence labeling and analyzed via machinelearning algorithms. 3D-qDMI is a high-throughput,
imaging-based assay that allows for the rapid cell-by-cell
analysis of MeC topology in thousands of individual cells,
with the ability to identify and flexibly eliminate outlier
cells in order to leverage data confidence.

Importantly, a connection between global
hypomethylation and aging has been proposed [25],
as reviewed by Pogribny and Vanyushin [26], based on
original observations in the different organs of various
species [27,28] and later confirmation with in vitro assays
using organ-derived cultured cells [29–34]. Therefore,
global hypomethylation can also be found in senescent
cells [35–39]. Replicative senescence (RS), originally
known as permanent growth arrest and repressible by
pharmacological intervention [40], is a naturally occurring
event in normally dividing cells after a certain number
of mitotic doublings [41]. Typically, growth arrest in
RS occurs during G1-phase of the cell cycle and is
accompanied by telomere shortening [42], the expression
of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) [43],
and the appearance of extremely condensed genomic areas
known as senescence-associated heterochromatin foci
(SAHF) [44]. Additionally, senescent cells mostly display
a distinct enlarged and flat cellular morphology [45].
Chromatin reorganization has been suggested
as a significant contributor to aging [49–50]. Separate
from RS, accelerated senescence can also be induced
in cells following exposure to certain stress factors:
this is more specifically referred to as stress-induced
premature senescence (SIS) [51]. Physiologically aged
and prematurely aged genomes also undergo wide-ranging
changes in epigenetic modifications that lead to chromatin
reorganization [52,53]. Early experiments in mammalian
cells have demonstrated the occurrence of a global decline
in DNA methylation in cultured cells including primary
fibroblasts from different species compared with their
immortalized counterparts [54,55]. The overall decline
of methylation results mostly from the loss of DNA
methylation at repetitive regions that represent about
55% of the human genome and are normally highly
methylated. Age-related global hypomethylation concerns
in particular satellite repeats (Sat2 and Satα DNA) as part
of constitutive heterochromatin located at pericentric and
centromeric loci [54–56], as well as interspersed repeat
sequences such as short interspersed nuclear elements
(SINES) and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINES)
that have been reported to become hypomethylated during
aging [57]. The importance of retrotransposons in aging
was supported by recent evidences in which the class
of Alu sequences — the most abundant primate SINE
— was found demethylated in the context of adult stem
cell aging, due to elevation in DNA damage as a result of
demethylation-induced increase in Alu transcription [58].
Interestingly, adipose-derived stem cells, which undergo
senescence in culture, could be rejuvenated by suppressing
Alu expression: a result that challenges the original
principle of the irreversibility of cellular senescence.
Also, several histone modifications are affected during
aging. Although driving mechanisms for chromatin and
epigenetic changes during aging are currently unknown,
it has been suggested that the epigenetic alterations
475

are largely triggered by DNA damage, reviewed by
Oberdoerffer and Sinclair [49]. In this scenario, randomly
occurring DNA damage leads to chromatin remodeling
with various functional consequences. Aged genomes are
characterized by increased DNA damage and high levels
of persistent DNA breaks. In particularly, and in line with
the morphological changes in chromatin, changes on the
histone-level can range from depletion such as in the
case of histone H2A [59] and changes in the abundance
level of histone-tail modifications. The heterochromatinassociated trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 and the
transcriptionally repressive trimethylation of histone H3
lysine 27 are largely lost in aged and prematurely aged
cells [60,61]. Conversely, global trimethylation of H4
lysine 20 increases with age [62]. Furthermore, probably as
a consequence of loss of pericentromeric heterochromatin
structure, physiologically aged and premature aged cells
express normally silenced heterochromatic satellite repeats
[54–56].
Investigations addressing the relationship between
tumorigenesis and senescent cells, have led to earlier
considerations hypothesizing that cellular senescence may
act as a tumor suppressing mechanism [63–71]. Even premalignant lesions may have a high chance of becoming
senescent cells and stop proliferation, depending on the
availability and activity of certain TSGs such as p53 or
p16. This fact induced an initial enthusiasm for senescence
as a strategy in cancer therapy. More recent experimental
results have led to reconsiderations of this approach.
Senescent cells, although permanently growth-inhibited
in turn may drive tumor cells and even normal cells in
the tumor microenvironment towards more aggressive
growth behavior by promoting chronic inflammation via
pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion [72,73]. Therefore,
benefits or disadvantages of the presence of senescent
cells may very well be context dependent. Along these
lines, a hallmark of malignant epithelial cancer cells in
comparison with their normal counterparts and benign
cancer cells is their significantly higher proliferation rate,
which they often acquire during the transformation phase
in the early stages of tumorigenesis. A better understanding
of these differences through studies of epigenetic features
in conjunction with chromatin organization in cells
may also lead to improvements in cancer diagnosis and
prognosis as well as therapies.
Recently, three-dimensional DNA methylation
imaging (3D-qDMI) was introduced with the notion of
characterizing cells and tissues based on their nuclear
global DNA methylation distribution patterns (MeC
phenotypes) in a cell-by-cell mode. Applications of
this technology have been utilized in the evaluation
of demethylating effects of epigenetic drugs and the
progression of human and mouse embryonic stem cells in
early differentiation [19–24]. In here, we report on using
3D-qDMI to probe the utility of MeC-related chromatin
texture features (MeC phenotypes) in characterizing cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

based on their proliferative capacity, i.e. growth behavior.
Being able to characterize fixed cells in conjunction with
this important characteristic could provide a more dynamic
picture of a cell population, therefore having tremendous
implications in cancer diagnostics/prognostics and anticancer drug development.

RESULTS
Additional experiments were performed, in which
primary and cancer cells were synchronized in interphase
to investigate any cell cycle-specific fluctuations in said
features. Since the main objective of this study was to
observe if changes in chromatin condensation and spatial
nuclear MeC patterns can be correlated to differences in
cellular proliferation capacity, it was necessary to verify
that our 3-D image analysis is able to distinguish between
differential nuclear texture information independent from
the cycle stage of the cell.

Differential growth behavior of cells
This study analyzed six different human cell types:
including two primary cells, neonatal dermal fibroblasts
(HDF) — the most extensively studied cell type in the
context of cellular aging — and prostate epithelial cells
(HPEpiC), as well as four human cell lines, modeling
androgen-sensitive and insensitive prostate cancer
(DU145 and LNCaP, respectively) and metastatic breast
cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, currently
disputed as melanoma-derived cell line). Primary cells
were grown to RS, while cancer cells were cultured
in parallel to provide sufficient statistical samples by
monitoring proliferation over equivalent time periods. At
specific time points during culture, a fraction of cells was
analyzed with 3D-qDMI. Cell counts and doubling times
during culture for both types of primary cells and the four
cancer cell lines used in this study are shown in Figure 1.
Doubling times increased in primary cells as cells reached
senescence, while doubling times stayed nearly constant
for all cancer cell lines, as anticipated. We observed that
DU145, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 grew at a
fairly similar rate, whereas the androgen-sensitive LNCaP
cells grew relatively slower. We assume that this might
have been due to lack of androgen in the culture medium.
The results confirm that proliferative capacity of primary
cells rapidly decrease as they age in culture, while this
capacity stays nearly constant for immortal cancer cell
lines.
Furthermore, in order to also assess differential
growth behavior and correlated MeC phenotypes of
primary and cancer cells in response to induction of
accelerated senescence (SIS), cells were exposed to H2O2
following previously published protocols [51, 74, 75].

(4) topological voxel-level parameters, which represent
degrees of meth and cond, and the correlation of the two
at the voxel level as assoc. Figure 2 depicts qualitative
changes of DNA methylation patterns in cultured primary
cells based on the first three types of analytical parameters:
as cells age, the relative pixel intensities in MeC and Ki-67
channels decrease, while the nuclear volume, delineated
by DAPI counterstaining, increases. These changes
correlate with increasing doubling times. Higher-passage
populations comprise a majority of enlarged senescent
cells. In our study, we also chemically induced growth
arrest in aggressively proliferating prostate cancer cells
(DU145) and a subset of HDF by exposing cells to H2O2
as previously mentioned. The stress-induced senescent
cancer cells analogously showed a differential MeC/DAPI
pattern in comparison with their proliferating counterparts,
although the latter as usual showed lower global MeC
levels than normal cells. Interestingly, there was no
significant difference in the MeC/DAPI patterns between
replicative senescence and stress-induced senescence
within the same cell type and also between HDF and
DU145 cells.

Immunofluorescence (IF) samples were generated
every 3-5 passages for primary cells, while for cancer
cells, at least 5 different IF samples were created at
selected passages throughout the culturing process. In
addition to visualization of MeC and gDNA, we also
co-stained for the proliferation marker Ki-67. Although
it is possible to quantify Ki-67 signal intensities using
the 3D-qDMI framework, for the purposes of this study
Ki-67 was only used as a qualitative marker to roughly
distinguish between proliferating and declined cells.
Typically, greater than thousand nuclear regions of interest
(ROI) were recognized in most analyzed IF samples. Of
these nuclear ROIs, those categorized as “dissimilar” and,
thus identified as outliers — based on methods previously
described in [21,22] — were excluded from subsequent
image analysis. In all images used in this study, the
percentages of nuclear ROIs deemed as outliers were less
than 1%, and their exclusion did not significantly alter data
confidence. Each nuclear ROI is analyzed individually
using 3D-qDMI, and the cell-specific data are then pooled
to form population-level statistics. This study focused on
four categories of analytical parameters to delineate DNA
methylation and chromatin condensation patterns in each
nucleus: (1) physical information, particularly the spatial
dimensions (in x-, y-, z-coordinates) and volume of ROI;
(2) MeC/DAPI codistribution; (3) statistics for a subset
of signals, i.e. percentage of low-intensity MeC (LIM%)
and low-intensity DAPI (LID%) pixels within ROIs,
determined by a threshold on image-inherent features; and

Topological voxel analysis for a more dynamic
analysis of nuclear textures
To investigate the correlation between MeC
topology/nuclear texture and cell proliferation a new
analytical module called topological voxel analysis
(TVA) was developed to extend pre-existing analytical
modules in 3D-qDMI [21,22]. In our previous work with
3D-qDMI, we focused on the analysis of topological

(left panel) and cumulative doublings are plotted against total days in culture for HDF and HPEpiC cells. Prostate epithelial cells that have
been established from adult tissue seem to approach senescence much earlier than neonatal dermal fibroblasts. For HDF cells, an abrupt
increase in doubling times occurs around passage 40, while similar behavior can be seen for HPEpiC cells at around passage 10. (B) Cancer
cells used in this study, also show variability of doubling times, with LNCaP cells growing significantly slower than the other three cell
lines. However, growth rates of cancer cells do not change much with increase in passage numbers, indicating their immortality.

distribution of low-intensity MeC (LIM) and lowintensity DAPI (LID) sites within the nuclear region of
interest (ROI) to highlight changes in chromatin density
between drug-treated and untreated cells. We experienced
a more differential analysis at the nuclear periphery,

which contain mostly facultative heterochromatin
[19,22]. However, differences more in the interior of
nuclei, which preferentially are composed of euchromatin
and constitutive heterochromatin, were more difficult to
discern via this approach, and requested a more careful

cells at selected passages during culture and in response to oxidative stress (SIS): As HDF and HPEpiC cells age, there is a general decline in
global MeC (green) signal. In parallel, the number of cells presenting the proliferation marker Ki-67 (red) decreases with increased passage
number. Cells at higher passage numbers exhibit larger nuclei. These qualitative phenotypes, as gleaned from visual impressions, correlate
with quantitative measurements: i.e. increasing doubling times and a flattening of the MeC/DAPI codistribution graphs in respective
scatter plots (shown for selected framed nuclei) in aging cells. In contrast, the representative and immortal DU145 cancer cell populations
comprise a majority of Ki-67-positive cells, with doubling times that are much shorter than primary cells. A convergence towards lowest
MeC-signal levels can be observed in senescent populations for the two categories of cells, independent from the cause of growth arrest,
either replicative or stress-induced (by H2O2 exposure).

meth. The parameter assoc describes the correlation of
low- or high-intensity pixels in both channels to determine
how associated one signal in a given physical space
is with the other signal in the same space. Once these
parameters are found for each voxel within the nuclear
ROI, they can be processed by two different methods.
First, topological changes in parametric value can be
measured at each normalized position from the nuclear
center to the periphery, and subsequently these trend
lines for each nuclear ROI in a cell population can be
compared to determine how much topological variation in
chromatin condensation and methylome distribution exists
for a given population of cells. Second, volume-weighted
mean of voxel-level parametric values are determined
to represent a singular parametric value for the whole

selection of signal cut-off levels for determining LIMs and
LIDs. In order to better utilize chromatin condensation as
a nuclear texture feature, we applied TVA that is based on
a different sub-compartmentalization of the nucleus than
previously used for the study of LIM/LID topology.
To quantify differences in the spatial codistribution
of DAPI and MeC signals the three parameters cond,
meth, and assoc were calculated for each nuclear ROI.
Our approach was inspired by previous publications
delineating heterogeneity and condensation levels of
stained chromatin for 2-D images [76–80]. Chromatin
condensation in a given voxel is measured by the
parameter cond, representing the condensation level of
genomic DNA, while the relative degree of methylation
in the same given voxel is measured by the parameter

type-specific respective distribution of topological voxel analysis parameters cond, meth, and assoc at the two major interphases of the cell
cycle (G0/G1 and G2) and for related unsynchronized control populations. In all graphs, each data point represents one nuclear ROI volume.
The parameter distributions display a high similarity across the three cell groups.

analysis parameters (cond, meth, and assoc) (Table 1)
plotted against the volume of nuclear ROIs. As can be seen
from this distribution scatter plot, there are no statistically
significant differences in the values of each parameter
for any of the three groups of cells; in other words, DNA
methylation and relevant chromatin condensation patterns
of cells are not unique to a particular stage of the cell

Figure 5: Voxel-based parameters in primary and cancer cells. (A) The graph presents pooled data from all primary cells. A
distinct positive correlation can be seen in meth and cond compared to inverse of doubling times. Low parameter values at low growth
capacity (as measured by doubling times) correspond to seemingly senescent cells, and high parameter values correspond to early passage
cells with short doubling times; with overall high correlativity to doubling times; meth: r2 = 0.772, cond: r2 = 0.757, and assoc: r2 = 0.410.
We interpret that DNA demethylation along with chromatin decondensation increase in primary cells as cell growth slows down. (B) In
comparison: according to pooled data from all cancer cells, immortal cells of all four kinds show a fairly equally low meth value (global
hypomethylation) at significantly higher proliferation rates (as measured by doubling times). Even though there are differences in doubling
times amongst the cancer cell lines, no significant correlation of parameter values with doubling times was measured (cond: r2 = 0.441;
meth: r2 = 0.474; assoc: r2 = 0.369).

cells with successive passage, as a sign of decline of the
overall proliferative capacity of these cells. This decline
was generally accompanied by a decrease in Ki-67
presentation, as evidenced in Figure 2.
Through each successive passage, both HDF and
HPEpiC show a progressive loss of global methylation
and became highly hypomethylated upon reaching
their respective RS point, as measured by an increase
in LIM% and a decrease in the parameter meth. Global
hypomethylation becomes highly evident after passage
30 in HDF cells and passage 10 in HPEpiC cells. At the
same time, an increase in LID% and a decrease in cond
could be observed, implying that global hypomethylation
is accompanied by chromatin reorganization in aging
cells. Therefore, as expected, the parameter assoc, which
measures the correlation of low- or high-intensity pixels
in both DAPI and MeC channels at a given voxel cube,
also increased as cells RS. This increase can be attributed
to the overall increase in the distribution of pixels within
the ROI that are of both, low-intensity DAPI and lowintensity MeC. These changes in global DNA methylation
and spatial genome organization are concordant with
visual impressions provided by high-resolution images
of stained cells, as previously shown in Figure 2. When
the correlation of the analytical parameters to doubling
times from all images of primary cell IF-samples was
calculated, parameters cond and meth showed high levels
of correlation with doubling times (Figure 5A).

cycle. Table 1 shows the mean and standard deviation
for various 3D-qDMI analysis parameters. The only
significant difference between the three populations —
for each cell type — is the nuclear (ROI) volume, which
is reasonable, considering the diploid state of cells in G2
versus G1 due to the extra copy of genomic DNA that was
synthesized during the intermediate S phase of the cell
cycle. From these results, we conclude that the imageanalysis features utilized to discriminate cells in growth
behavior are detached from cell cycle phases. Therefore,
feature data collected from cells that are randomly fixed
in non-synchronous populations will not be influenced by
this inherent parameter of living cells.

We then assessed the fourth type of analytical
parameter in the same samples as above. For that, the
three TVA features meth, cond, and assoc, were measured
in all cell types at specific time points within the entire
culture duration for HDF and HPEpiC cells (Figure 4). As
previously shown in Figure 1, the two primary cell types
reached RS after around 50 and 15 doublings, respectively.

methylation, as evidenced by high LIM% and low meth,
compared to primary cells with similar proliferation rates.
Primary cells with higher proliferation capacities (in the
earlier passages) usually showed higher degrees of global
methylation with meth ~ 0.5, as previously shown in
Figure 4, while for cancer cells, values of meth remained
well below this level for all cancer cell types. On the other
hand values for LID% and cond were similar to that of
highly proliferative, early passage primary cells. As in
cancer cells, global hypomethylation was not necessarily
correlated with signs of chromatin decondensation. In
these types of cells we consistently registered assoc-values
lower than those measured in primary cells; although

this difference was not large enough to be statistically
significant. Therefore, in order to further search for
measureable chromatin texture-based differences
between highly proliferative primary and cancer cells,
we calculated the degree of correlation between the TVA
parameters and the cells’ doubling. Figure 5B shows a
scatter plot of doubling times and 3D-qDMI analytical
parameters for each cancer cell line used in this study.
Unlike in primary cells, none of the TVA parameters
correlated satisfactorily with doubling times in cancer cell
lines. This is an interesting difference observed between
normal and cancer cells, which can be interpreted as such:
values of these parameters may be disconnected from
growth rates (and associated proliferative capacity) in
transformed cells.
To determine how well TVA parameters correlate
to doubling times, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were
calculated between each parameter and the inverse of
doubling times, as shown in Table 4.
In primary cells, both cond and meth showed good
level of correlativity with r2 > 0.75. The same was not
experienced for cancer cells: instead both showed poor
correlativity with r2 < 0.5. Using this knowledge, primary
cell data was fitted to a logistic curve. Several models were
explored, including exponential, logarithmic, polynomial,
and linear models. The logistic model was chosen from
ANOVA (analysis of variance) analysis. Figure 6 exhibits
the same data as in Figures 5A and 5B overlaid with
logistic fitting curves. From these results it is apparent
that cancer cells display parametric values outside the
confidence range that can be estimated from primary cell
data, and these differences could be used to discriminate
primary and cancer cells. However, this claim needs to be
verified in future follow-up studies.

cells and cancer cells as evidenced by voxel-based
parameters. When comparing primary cell data (dark,

diamond markers) to cancer cell data (light, square markers), it
can be seen that while primary cells correlate well to growth
capacity (as measured by doubling time), cancer cells do not.
In this figure, both cond and meth are fit with a logistic curve,
which was determined to be the best fitting curve based on F-test
results. Parametric values from cancer cell populations lie further
away from fitted curves and from primary cell populations.

shows image analysis results for untreated proliferating
(control), as well as RS- and SIS-HDF cells. Both visual
and quantitative data reveal no difference in the two types
of senescent cells regarding said features.
In the case of cancer cells, such as DU145, SIS-type
cells exhibited: (i) larger nuclear ROI, (ii) an increase
in LID% and LIM%, and (iii) decreased values for cond
and meth. Thus, the LIM/LID and the meth/cond data
sets are in agreement with one another. Table 6 compares
image analysis results for untreated proliferating and SISDU145 cells. The parametric (feature) values from nuclei
in the latter group are on par with those observed in RS
primary cells, indicating that there is also no difference
between transformed (originally immortal) cells and
primary cells, when they are driven or accelerated into
senescence. Therefore, it seems as if the stage of growth
arrest is correlated with the differential TVA features,
independent from the cells original growth character and
the method by which senescence was elicited. In a closer
look at our measures, we gleaned that untreated cancer
cells exhibit lower degrees of meth/cond (~30% less)
concordant with higher values for LIM/LID (~21%) than
early passage primary cells. Therefore, concerning these
features, aggressively growing cancer cells seem to take an

DNA methylation and chromatin condensation
patterns of replicative senescent cells and stressinduced senescent cells are similar
In order to establish a correlative relationship
between proliferative capacity of cells — as measured by
cellular growth rates — and TVA features, it was necessary
to set a baseline value for these analytical parameters
using a known non-proliferative cell. As mentioned above,
primary cells were grown until they reached replicative
senescence, in order to obtain cells that lack growth
potential. Separate from RS, stress-induced premature
senescence was studied by treating HDF and DU145 cells
with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Details on concentration
and time of peroxide treatment and pre- and post-treatment
cell counts are available in the Supplementary Materials
(File 3). Senescence was verified in both, RS and SIS cells
by two methods in parallel subcultures at same propagation
time points: (i) a subset of cells was simultaneously
immunostained for the proliferation marker Ki-67 in
the IF, and a marked decrease in the presence of Ki-67
signals in both types of senescent cells over regularly
proliferating cells was noticed; (ii) another subset of cells
was colorimetrically stained for presence of senescenceassociated β-galactosidase (SA-βgal). RS and SIS cell
populations presented an absolute majority of large and
flat cells with strong SA-βgal expression compared with
populations with predominantly proliferating cells (data
not shown).
As previously demonstrated in Figure 2, structural
differences between normally proliferating cells and
senescent cells could be retrieved by visual inspection,
while no significant differences were observed between RS
and SIS cells. For primary cells, H2O2-treatment yielded
typical MeC phenotypes that were very similar to MeC
phenotypes of RS cells. Both types of growth-arrested
cells have strongly reduced MeC loads and the associated
TVA features verify these changes quantitatively. Table 5

derived from the 3-D image- and flow-cytometrical results of

In a nutshell, cancer cells with an accelerated growth behavior
compared with their normal counterparts take a meta-stage in
global DNA methylation and chromatin condensation levels
between the latter and senescent cells that have reached growth
arrest. As benign primary cells seem to reach cancer-cell
equivalent stages of the two parameters at some point in aging,
this calls the question as to whether the underlying sequence
of molecular profiles may differ between the two categories of
cells. Along the same lines of thought, it would be informative
exploring this matter also for SIS, which is depicted as a shorter
but more forceful process (thick arrow) than gradual aging (thin
arrow).

DAPI colocalization patterns and 3-D maps of LIMs and
LIDs. The latter feature required a careful selection of
defined intensity thresholds, which works well for the
more consistent structure of the nuclear periphery, but may
face challenges in the mapping of more subtle changes
in the more internal nuclear regions: due to dynamic
local differences in the euchromatin and heterochromatin
portions of DNA. Therefore, we have extended 3D-qDMI
with a new analytical module, termed topological
voxel analysis. The idea behind this amendment is that
fluctuations in chromatin reorganization, that in our case
accompany DNA demethylation, can be traced through the
measurement of DAPI intensity changes in the nucleus.
When using 3D-qDMI to track changes in in situ
DNA methylation and chromatin condensation patterns,
an inquiry we made was, whether our approach would
be sensitive to differences in MeC/DAPI codistribution
patterns based on the unsynchronized cells being at
different interphase cell cycle phases. This consideration is
important in dissecting pattern changes that are attributed
to conditional alterations (of interest) from cell cyclespecific influences. In our analytical practice, cells in
M- (mitotic) phase were excluded from assessment for
two reasons: (a) most of these cells go through different
nucleation phases and do not allow for a proper ROI
determination (based on DAPI counterstaining), (b)
because the unique and highly compact chromatin
conformation is not suitable for differential pattern
recognition. Because of these properties, all M-phase cells
were automatically flagged as outlier cells by 3D-qDMI
software and excluded from further analysis, based on
criteria given in [21]. It is also important to note that the
number of M-phase cells, in a given specimen, compared
to the number of cells in the interphase is relatively small,
and thus their elimination from topological analysis will
not have an impact on the final statistical outcome.
Although trying to interpret chromatin condensation
using microscopy is not a new approach [48–52], to the
best of our knowledge, our approach is novel in retrieving
and cross correlating changes in both signatures — DNA
methylation texture patterns and chromatin organization
— with cellular proliferation, by means of confocal
microscopy and comprehensive 3D image analysis. This
was based on the hypothesis that higher resolved and
therefore more differential texture information would be
extractable from 3D analysis than from 2D analysis or
maximum intensity projections of fluorescence signals.
Additionally, we have chosen cell types and conditions
that would allow us to associate the two signatures with
the three major groups of cell growth behavior: normally
proliferating primary cells, highly proliferating cancer
cells, and minimally proliferating senescent (or nearsenescent) cells derived from these two cell types. The
latter group enabled us to capture nuclear signatures in
a more continuous form during which primary cells
gradually changed their capability from growing at their

DISCUSSION
The main objective of this study was to investigate
the relationship between the spatial nuclear distribution
of methylcytosine — as an epigenomic landmark in
conjunction with chromatin condensation patterns — and
cellular growth behavior, using a novel image-cytometrical
approach. This study was inspired by the notion to
discover chromatin texture-based features that can be
extracted by automated image analysis for generating a
more dynamic and activity-based picture of individual
cells in a population; with conceivable applications
in pre-clinical drug testing and cancer pathology. By
delineating and quantifying in situ spatial distributions
of genomic DNA and MeC residues, 3D-qDMI delivers
a dynamic and motion-based picture of cells. Especially
in clinical pathology, where traditional staining methods
provide a more static picture reminiscent of the tissue’s
history but mostly challenging the prediction of tissue
(and disease) fate, extracted TVA features could support
tissue characterization towards more confident prognosis.
Thus, 3D-qDMI may contribute as a high-throughput,
and cost-effective companion assay for screening of
tumors and other epigenetics-related abnormalities. Our
approach follows the appeal of exploiting differential
DNA methylation patterns as potentially powerful
epigenetic markers in the characterization and therapy
cancer malignancies [81–83]. Changes in the DNA
methylation profile of cancer cells are often comprised
of hypermethylation of single gene promoters, leading
to aberrant silencing of disease-related genes, and global
hypomethylation of repetitive sequences in intergenic
regions and heterochromatic areas of the genome:
tumor cells harbor at average 20–45% less MeC content
compared with their normal counterparts [13, 84–89].
The effect of hypomethylation on cancer cells has been
evidenced as correlating with chromosomal instability
[90,91]. Though some variations exist in the DNA
methylation profile among different types of tumors, the
general trends of specific hypermethylation, mostly within
CpG islands, and global hypomethylation appear to be
ubiquitous in all tumors [36, 92]. Therefore, a secondary
objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of
distinguishing and/or discriminating cells with different
proliferative capacities, based on their spatial nuclear
DNA methylation phenotypes and relevant higher-order
genome organization.
The most important consideration behind any
imaging-based assay is to accurately quantify imaged
signals and in situ patterns at or even beyond the level of
human visual perception. In our previous publications [19,
21,22], we had introduced image-analysis tools to highlight
differences in DNA methylation patterns based on MeC/

fastest (normal) rate in the early passages all the way to
irreversible growth stop. Our results show that 3D-qDMI
enhanced with the newly developed analytical methods
is able to quantify phenotypic differences visualized
through optical imaging, and that these differences match
previously reported descriptions of epigenetic phenomena
in cancer cells and senescent cells.
Initially, this study had planned to include a G1-only
synchronization using thymidine block and nocodazole,
which arrests cells in the mitotic phase. However, one
major technical difficulty arose when using this approach.
Cells arrested in the M-phase usually rounded up and
detached from the glass surface; these detached cells could
not be strongly re-attached (to allow immunofluorescence
staining) to the substrate before cells progressed from
G1 to S- phase. Furthermore, although not the primary
reason for not using nocodazole, a recent publication from
Cooper et al. [93] has suggested that nocodazole cannot
synchronize cells properly. Therefore, acknowledging
technical limitations in fixed cell assays and the limitations
with nocodazole-inhibition, arresting cells to quiescence
(G0 phase) via serum starvation seemed to be a reasonable
alternative. While G0-phase cells are temporarily nondividing, they are not post-mitotic cells and could
be triggered to enter the cell cycle under appropriate
conditions [94]. Most importantly, methylation patterns
of G0/G1 synchronized populations were not affected by
deleterious drug treatment.
Flow cytometry of G0/G1 and G2 synchronized
populations for both HDF and DU145 cells revealed that
the cell cycle synchronization was highly efficient, as the
vast majority of cells were found to be in the targeted cell
cycle phase. At the same time, the image-cytometrical
analysis of respective parallel populations using 3D-qDMI
showed high degrees of homogeneity regarding DAPI/
MeC codistribution patterns, further supporting the results
from flow cytometry. Using 3D-qDMI, no statistically
significant differences were found between the G0/G1 and
G2 synchronized populations and the control population
for both HDF and DU145 cells, in all topological analysis
criteria (LID%, LIM%, cond, meth, and assoc). This
result may not be surprising considering that methylation
of hemi-methylated DNA (replicated strand) by DNA
methyltransferase Dnmt1 is tightly coupled with the
replication process [95, 96]. Since this process is meant
to mirror the molecular methylation patterns on the
replicated strand, it should not change the distribution of
methylcytosine within the genome and thus MeC/DAPI
codistribution should essentially stay constant. This is in
line with the fact that chromatin organization should be
conserved during S-phase and inherited to daughter cells
upon cell division [94, 97,98]. Therefore the differential
methylation phenotypes we observed with 3D-qDMI in
this study can be robustly associated with growth behavior
and are not skewed by the inherent cell-cycle variability
within analyzed cell populations. This fact renders DNA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

methylation phenotyping highly valuable for pathological
tissue characterization in which synchronicity of cells
within their native environment is naturally not the case.
With this confidence, the relationship between
cellular proliferation capacity and chromatin organization
was studied. Primary cells were grown to their Hayflick
limit, as they reached replicative senescence. The number
of cells in culture was counted after every passage to
generate a comprehensive database of growth rates. The
proliferation capacity (as measured by doubling time) was
fairly consistent for over the first 30 passages in HDF cells
and the first 9 passages in HPEpiC cells. Past this point,
the doubling times slowly increased followed by a sudden
leap around passage 40 for HDF cells and passage 11 for
HPEpiC cells. This event coincided with the majority
of cells becoming senescent, and a residual minimal
growth for a few cells within the propagated populations.
The RS-cells showed a significant level of global
hypomethylation, and enlarged nuclear morphology, and
these changes could be detected by light microscopy and
more thoroughly quantified with 3D-qDMI. To better
understand topological changes in DNA methylation
and accompanying chromatin reorganization, 3D-qDMI
considers a variety of analytical parameters. Although
these parameters are all related to the codistribution of
MeC/DAPI signals found in the same image, they do
not behave in exactly the same fashion. For example, in
HDF cells, meth begins to decline significantly around
passage 25, but this behavior is not seen by change in
LIM%, although these two values are correlated. These
differences can be used in creating a unique picture of
the analyzed cells. When cells became essentially postmitotic, reorganization of genomic DNA was observed.
This is evidenced by an increase in LID% and the
correlated decrease in cond. However, at the same time,
we observed a gain in the nuclear ROI volume. As, the
total nuclear content of the cells did not change over time,
a reduction in gDNA condensation could be associated
with two phenomena: (i) global hypomethylation, and (ii)
an increase in nuclear space. In comparison, the growth
characteristics of cancer cells remained fairly consistent
throughout the culture. A fraction of cells were fixed
for immunofluorescence assay and subsequent image
analysis; for each cancer cell type, at least five different
cell populations (collected from different time points)
were analyzed for this comprehensive study. 3D-qDMI
parameters revealed that all cells showed reduced MeC
pixel intensities, compared with primary cells. Global
DNA hypomethylation in cancer cells is a well-known
phenomenon, and is in stark contrast to that of normally
proliferating primary cells at early passages, whereas
both types of cells exhibited quite similar spatial intensity
distributions in the DAPI channel.
Prior to any regression analysis, it was necessary to
set a baseline value for non-proliferating cells. For this
purpose, we decided to model this behavior with senescent

cells. Representative for cancer cells, DU145 cells were
treated with H2O2 to pressure cells into stress-induced
senescence. Regarding the analytical parameters used in
this study, values for cond and meth decreased, suggesting
that SIS exerts a dual effect: DNA demethylation and
concurrent chromatin decondensation. In parallel, HDF
cells were also treated with H2O2 to observe if SIS yields
values different from RS cells. However, no difference
could be observed between the two types of senescent cells
by 3D-qDMI. This observation leads to the conclusion
that: untreated cancer cells, which generally exhibited
lower degrees of meth/cond concordant with higher values
for LIM/LID than early passage primary cells, seem to
take an intermediate level between normally proliferating
and senescent primary cells (Figure 7). In other words,
the stage of senescence is correlated with values of the
TVA-derived chromatin features that are below the level
of cancer cells. However, a decrease in global DNA
methylation and an increase of DNA decondensation both
have causal associations with genomic instability, and the
degree of both phenomena has so far been correlated with
the degree of malignancy. Thus, the data suggests that by
pushing the global level of the two cell properties below
a certain level, the cells independent of their proliferative
capacity and genomic make-up, could be driven into
senescence. It would be interesting to identify the
underlying DNA sequences and their genomic localization
that match or even contribute to these particular cell
behavior characteristics. This would provide insight as
to whether there is a specific order of demethylation and
structural changes taking place on the genome when the
cells are driven towards senescence, and whether there are
even differences if this process occurs gradually or more
forcefully, also depending on the genomic and epigenomic
make-up of the naïve cells.
Correlation analysis of voxel-based parameters to
growth rates demonstrated distinct differences between
primary and cancer cells. In primary cells, the parameters
LID%, LIM%, cond, and meth showed high levels of
correlativity to doubling times, whereas similar trends
could not be found in cancer cells, even though the four
cancer cell lines showed different doubling times that span
a similar range observed with primary cells during in vitro
aging. Statistical analysis with two-sample t-test revealed
that these differences were significant (p < 0.01). Thus, it
is conceivable that the relationship between growth rate
and voxel-based parameters could be used to discriminate
between normally growing cells, such as primary cells, and
aggressively fast-growing cells, such as cancer cells. For
application in cancer diagnostics, ideally, any phenotyping
should be based only on image-intrinsic features, and not
dependent on doubling times or other growth-related
statistics, which constitute a priori knowledge that would
not be available in fixed biopsy sections. Nevertheless, this
type of approach could become useful in live-cell assays,
which allow for monitoring of cells such as in pre-clinical
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

drug screening and personalized treatment development
with cultured patient cells; especially in the development
of epigenetic drugs that aim at remodeling cells and their
growth characteristics.
In conclusion, this study verifies the capability of
3D-qDMI to map and quantitate dynamic changes in
DNA methylation patterns and associated chromatin
organization. Using this cell-by-cell imaging-based
assay together with novel informatics tools we were able
to make two key observations. 1) We could reconcile,
a gradual increase in global hypomethylation and
decondensation of genomic DNA for primary cells during
aging in culture, confirming previous reports based on
molecular assays [29–34]. In comparison, cancer cells
of various origins, although having different doubling
times did not display any differences in the two nuclear
phenomena, and revealed constant proliferation rates over
the entire culturing time. The results are in agreement with
previous documentations [49,54,99]. 2) Cells, independent
from their class and original growth capacity, converge
to the highest level of global DNA hypomethylation and
decondensation when reaching senescence. This fact
concurs with significant changes to higher-order genome
organization in our study, as previously reported in
conjunction with age-related DNA damage [100]. Recent
evidences suggest that these alterations of the chromatin
structure is caused by the relocation of chromatin
modifiers such as histone deacetylase SIRT1 [101] and the
nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD)
complex in mammals [102] and from repetitive DNA in
constitutive heterochromatin as a result of DNA damage
due to an impaired DNA repair machinery. Based on the
abovementioned differences, we were able to determine a
correlation between the reciprocal analytical parameters
LIM%/LID% and meth/cond and the proliferative
capacity of cells. As both, aging and transforming cells
exhibit overlapping changes in their methylation profiles,
the relocation of epigenetic machinery from its normal
distribution in the genome could be a link between
heterochromatin demethylation and the hypermethylation
of cancer-related genes, leading to coexistence of the
two aberrations in aging and cancer cells as discussed
by Teschendorff et al. in [103]. Therefore, it is becoming
increasingly obvious that cell growth behavior is tightly
related to the interplay between the various epigenetic
mechanisms and spatial genome organization. Combined
imaging- and sequencing-based methylation structure
analyses with recently available technologies [104–107]
could unravel the differential methylation patterns and
related genome supraorganization in aging cells and
improve our understanding of how these signatures
are distinct in cellular fate: namely between growth
deceleration towards senescence and transformation into
aggressively proliferating cancer cells, with implications
in drug-based therapy.

were placed in a medium containing DMEM supplemented
with 1% FBS and the appropriate concentration of
HPLC-grade H2O2 solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for
2 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2. After peroxide treatment,
cells grown in tissue culture flasks were detached by
treatment with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA, seeded onto glass
coverslips, and allowed to recover for 24 hours in regular
culturing medium (DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS). Subsequently, cells were washed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and fixed for immunofluorescence

cells were allowed to recover for up to 7 days in regular
medium. Cells in the control group and the two H2O2treated groups were counted at three time points: (i)
immediately after peroxide treatment, (ii) at 24 hours post
treatment, and (iii) one week after senescence induction.
Dead cells were excluded from cell counts with Trypan
blue exclusion assay. Senescence in these cells were
verified by light-microscopic observation of morphology,
as well as staining for β-galactosidase expression with the

cell DU145, as well as the breast cancer cell line MDAMB231 and MDA-MB435 of controversial origin [108]
(all ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured at 37°C
and 5% CO2 following standard culture procedures.
HPEpiCs were grown in Prostate Epithelial Cell Basal
Medium (ScienCell) supplemented with Prostate
Epithelial Cell Growth Kit (ScienCell). LNCaP cells were
grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA,
USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Mediatech), 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Mediatech),
and 2.5 µg/mL Fungizone (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA). All other cells (HDF, DU145, MDA-MB231, and
MDA-MB435) were grown in Dulbecco’s Modification
of Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (Mediatech) supplemented
with 10% FBS, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, and 2.5 µg/
mL Fungizone. Primary cells were grown until their RS
was reached. Cancer cells were grown for 8–10 passages,
so that at least 5 distinct samples could be generated. All
cells were passaged at 75–80% confluency with 0.05%
trypsin-EDTA (Mediatech) to maintain uniform culturing
conditions. Typically, during this study, cells were
usually passaged every 4-5 days. If cells were at reduced
proliferation levels, as in those cells near RS, and did not
reach the aforementioned confluence levels for passaging,
culture medium was changed once a week. Cells were
regularly monitored for both phenotype and cell counts;
phenotype was evaluated by light microscopy and cell
counting was performed at time of each passage with a
hemocytometer, and Trypan blue staining (Invitrogen) was
used to exclude dead cells from propagation statistics.

Cell cycle synchronization and cell viability
HDF and DU145 cells were seeded onto glass
coverslips at the concentration of 105 cells/mL for
immunocytochemical staining and subsequent imaging
via confocal microscopy. For FACS, a parallel set of
cultures at the same concentration was maintained in
TC-grade culture flasks, and processed as previously
described [19]. Enrichment efficiency was evaluated by
flow cytometry using a Becton-Dickinson FACScan (BD
Biosciences). Excitation was achieved with a 488 nm
laser line, and emission was collected at 617 nm. FACS
data was then analyzed using ModFit LT (Verity Software
House, Topsham, ME, USA). Separately, cell viability
was tested, as the synchronization steps involved serum
starvation. The two populations were tested for apoptosis
using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit I
(BD Biosciences) and flow cytometry. The results were
analyzed by FACSDiva (BD Biosciences).

Stress-induced premature senescence
Stress-induced premature senescence was induced in
HDF and DU145 cells via application of H2O2 following
previously published protocols [46,47, 70]. HDF cells
used for SIS study were at passage 20. Prior to application
of H2O2, cells were grown to near-confluency (~100%).
For cell counting purposes, a fraction of these cells was
seeded in 6-well culture plates at 8·105 cells/ml, 24 hours
before treatment with H2O2. SIS cells were studied at three
different conditions: (i) control group (no H2O2); (ii) 200
µM H2O2, previously deemed as the appropriate level for
induction of senescence [109]; and (iii) 500 µM H2O2, a
lethal dose of peroxide. For each condition, confluent cells

Immunofluorescence staining
At set time points, a fraction of cultured cells was
seeded onto glass coverslips and allowed to attach for 24
hours. Cells are then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS,
and sequentially stained with a mouse monoclonal antiMeC primary antibody (clone 33D3, GeneTex, Irvine,
CA), and an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse
polyclonal secondary antibody (Life Technologies).
For some samples, cells were simultaneously stained
with an additional set of a rabbit polyclonal anti488

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 474-493

Ki-67 primary antibody (ab833, Abcam, Cambridge,
MA) and subsequently Alexa 568-conjugated and a
goat anti-rabbit polyclonal IgG (Invitrogen) to verify
proliferation [111–113]. Although signals for Ki-67 can
be quantified using methods described in the following
subsection, for the purposes of this research, Ki-67
was only used as a qualitative proliferation marker.
Following immunocytochemical staining, specimens were
counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for delineation of
nuclear gDNA, as previously described [19,23].

(if necessary) of outlier cells in a given population. For
all analyses used in this study, we have eliminated all
nuclear ROIs deemed “dissimilar” (i.e., nuclear ROI
with K-L divergence value greater than 4.5) according to
definitions provided in [21]. Within defined nuclear ROIs,
the chromatin condensation level and associated spatial
distribution of MeC residues are analyzed by dividing a
given ROI into cubes of constant voxel sizes (500 nm per
side), which was decided by the physical limitations of the
imaging system, namely due to the excitation wavelengths
of fluorophores and the objective lens used for confocal
microscopy. The methodology and justification for
dividing nuclear ROI into these voxels are explained in
the Supplementary Materials (File 4). The distribution and
location of low- and high-intensity pixels are analyzed for
each voxel. These results are later combined for further
analyses by comparing the condensation patterns for DAPI
signals with associated changes of methylation patterns
in the MeC channel. Finally, three other types of data,
which were extracted from these images, were considered
in the analyses presented in this study. First, the nuclear
ROI volume is defined as the number of pixels within
a given ROI. Since all imaging used in this study was
done at identical image settings, each pixel represents a
physical space of 120 nm (x) x 120 nm (y) x 250 nm (z).
For convenience, all nuclear ROI volumes presented in
here are defined as numbers of individual pixels. Second,
for both DAPI and MeC channels, the mean of pixel
intensities within a defined nuclear ROI was measured.
Third, based upon a threshold derived from imageinherent features, the percentage of low-intensity pixels
in either DAPI (LID%) or MeC (LIM%) channel was
measured and mapped in each nuclear ROI. More details
on how a threshold intensity level is determined for each
image is provided in the Supplementary Materials (File 6).

Image acquisition
Stained samples were imaged using an inverted
confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems
TCS SP5X Supercontinuum, Mannheim, Germany),
equipped with a white-light laser for continuous excitation
between 470 to 670 nm, and a 405 nm diode laser line
for excitation of DAPI fluorescence. Images are acquired
as a 3-D image (x, y, z) by collecting serial 2-D optical
sections (x, y) at 250 nm increments (z) using a Plan-Apo
63X 1.3 glycerol immersion lens (pinhole size was 1.0
Airy unit). Each optical section is acquired at a resolution
of 2048 x 2048 pixels, with a respective voxel size of
120 nm x 120 nm x 250 nm (x, y, and z axes), and at a
dynamic range of 12 bits per pixel. As such, the field of
view in each section corresponded to a 246 µm by 246 µm
square. As the cell monolayer area was much larger than
the field of view, the entire IF sample was tiled and serial
sections were generated at each position represented by
tiling. To avoid possible bleed-through of signals (crosstalk effect) between the channels, images for each channel
were acquired sequentially. To improve signal-to-noise
ratio, each recorded image was averaged four times. Raw
images were obtained as Leica Image Format (lif) and
offline-converted to a series of TIFFs for downstream
image analysis.

Statistical analysis

Computational image analysis

Analysis of data obtained with 3D-qDMI was
performed with either Matlab or Origin (OriginLab Corp.,
Northampton, MA). Pearson’s correlation coefficients
were calculated to determine the correlativity of
parametric values to growth rates, while two-way ANOVA
tests were applied for determining the best fitting model
from primary cell data.

Acquired images were analyzed using dedicated
software developed with Matlab (MathWorks, Natick,
MA, USA). Parts of this analytical tool were previously
reported with more detailed explanation of methods used
for 3-D image segmentation [21,22, 114]. Briefly, acquired
3-D images were segmented and binarized by a threshold
intensity that was determined from image-inherent
features, to obtain seeds, which were used to define
distinct 3-D nuclear ROIs via a modified version of seeded
watershed algorithm [115] extended to three dimensions.
Once nuclear ROIs are clearly defined, nuclear similarity
and population homogeneity is assessed using KullbackLeibler (K-L) divergence [116] for each cell in a given
population through the extraction of colocalized MeC/
DAPI patterns, allowing for identification and elimination
