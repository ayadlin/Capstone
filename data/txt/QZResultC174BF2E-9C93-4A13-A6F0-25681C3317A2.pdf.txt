ABSTRACT
Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy is
an option for lung cancers harboring wild-type EGFR when chemotherapeutic reagents
have failed. In this study, we found that the EGFR-TKI, gefitinib, modestly suppressed
proliferation of the lung cancer cell lines, A549 and H358, which both harbor wild-type
EGFR. Treatment with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) reduced the sensitivity to
gefitinib, whereas sensitivity was restored by treatment with an HGF antibody, a
MET inhibitor, or depletion of MET but not ErbB3 gene. Moreover, both PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors and MEK inhibitors suppressed proliferation of A549 cells, whereas only
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors effectively suppressed cell viability of EGFR mutant PC-9 cells.
Our findings suggest that HGF reduced the gefitinib sensitivity through MET and
downstream PI3K and MAPK pathways. Combined use of EGFR-TKI and MET inhibitors
or inhibition of downstream signaling molecules might be a better second or third line
choice for a group of patients with advanced lung cancer harboring wild-type EGFR.

INTRODUCTION

EGFR-TKIs, such as erlotinib, gefitinib, and
afatinib, are established as initial standard therapies
[6–9]. These treatments are particularly effective against
NSCLCs harboring activating mutations in EGFR, such
as the exon 19 deletion and L858R mutation. Activating
mutations in EGFR are observed in up to 50% of lung
adenocarcinomas in Asians and approximately 10% of
Caucasians with NSCLC [10]. Although most patients
with EGFR mutations initially respond to TKI therapy,
almost all develop acquired resistance. Therefore, in trinsic
and acquired resistance have become serious barriers to
the outcomes of patients treated with these reagents.
Many of the EGFR-TKI resistant mechanisms
have been revealed. Recent studies using new generation
EGFR-TKIs show good efficacy in resistant tumors with
the EGFR T790M gatekeeper mutation, which accounts
for approximately 50% of resistant tumors [11, 12].
Previously, we have reported that hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF), the ligand of the MET receptor, induces resistance

Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) account for
about 85% of lung cancers. Among patients with NSCLC,
more than 65% present with locally advanced or metastatic
disease [1]. Unfortunately, less than 15% of patients with
lung cancer survive more than five years. Over the past
decade, the identification of specific genetic alterations,
such as oncogenic drivers, in lung cancers has lead to a
new period of targeted therapy [2]. Targeting oncogenic
drivers, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), has brought the
most encouraging improvements in lung cancer treatment.
Clinical trials of targeted therapy, such as with EGFRtyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy in EGFR
mutant NSCLC and crizotinib therapy in ALK rearranged
NSCLC, have demonstrated major improvements in
treatment response, quality of life, and progression-free
survival compared to chemotherapy [3–5].

to gefitinib or new generation EGFR-TKIs in EGFR
mutant lung adenocarcinomas through the MET/Gab1/
PI3K/Akt pathway, without involvement of ErbB3 [13,
14], although ErbB3 was critical in MET amplification–
induced gefitinib resistance [15]. We also found that the
MET inhibitor, E7050, successfully overcame HGFinduced resistance to EGFR-TKIs [16, 17].
For most patients with advanced lung cancer
harboring wild-type EGFR, chemotherapy is the prior
choice [18]. However, resistance to chemotherapeutic
reagents usually develops over time and limits the
clinical benefit from chemotherapy. Although the effect of
EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients with wild-type EGFR
remains controversial, some clinical data have shown
survival benefit derived from EGFR-TKI treatment
for patients previously treated with chemotherapy but
still developed disease progression [19–22]. Therefore,
several guidelines recommend EGFR-TKIs as an option of
second-line treatments for NSCLC patients with wild-type
EGFR [23]. Considering the nearly unavoidable resistance
to EGFR-TKIs, we propose that a resistance mechanism
may also exist in wild-type EGFR lung cancer. If the
potential resistance can be identified prior to EGFR-TKI
therapy, this specific group of patients may benefit more
from EGFR-TKIs.
Since HGF/MET was previously identified as
playing a critical role in the resistance mechanism of
EGFR-TKIs in EGFR mutant NSCLC, we investigated
whether HGF also influenced EGFR-TKI sensitivity in
lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring wild-type EGFR.
We found that HGF significantly reduced sensitivity to
gefitinib through the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways in
lung cancer cells with wild-type EGFR. A MET inhibitor,
PHA-665752, completely restored the sensitivity to
EGFR-TKI. The results of this study suggest that
combined use of EGFR-TKI and MET inhibitors or
inhibition of downstream signaling molecules, such as
PI3K or MEK, might be a better second or third-line
strategy for a group of patients with advanced lung cancer
harboring wild-type EGFR.

In a parallel study, erlotinib suppressed cell viability of
H358 cells, but treatment with HGF rescued cells from the
effects of erlotinib (Figure 1C). These data indicate that
HGF reduced EGFR-TKI sensitivity in lung cancer cells
harboring wild-type EGFR.

HGF reduces sensitivity to gefitinib by directly
restoring phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2
Next, we explored whether inhibition of MET,
the receptor of HGF, could restore the sensitivity to
gefitinib in lung cancer cells with wild-type EGFR that
were pretreated with HGF. Although the MET inhibitor,
PHA-665752, did not affect the growth of H358 or A549
cells at concentrations less than 0.3 μmol/L, it restored the
sensitivity of cells to gefitinib in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 2A).
Although both MET gene amplification and
HGF treatment has been shown to induce gefitinib
resistance in lung cancers with EGFR mutations, ErbB3
transactivation is involved only in MET amplification
but not in HGF-induced resistance [25]. Therefore, to
explore the molecular mechanism by which HGF reduces
sensitivity to gefitinib in lung cancer harboring wild-type
EGFR, we examined the phosphorylation status of MET,
EGFR, ErbB3, and the downstream signaling pathways
by western blotting. H358 and A549 cells expressed
EGFR, ErbB3, and MET proteins, and these molecules
were constitutively phosphorylated at various levels.
The downstream proteins Akt and ERK1/2 were also
phosphorylated. Consistent with the cell viability data,
gefitinib successfully inhibited the phosphorylation of
EGFR, ErbB3, Akt, and ERK1/2 (Figure 2B). Neither
HGF nor PHA-665752 treatment alone affected
phosphorylation of EGFR or ErbB3. However, HGF
stimulated phosphorylation of MET; MET phosphorylation
was inhibited by PHA-665752. Importantly, even in the
presence of gefitinib, HGF restored phosphorylation of
Akt and ERK1/2, but not EGFR or ErbB3 (Figure 2B).
Moreover, the combination of PHA-665752 with gefitinib
inhibited MET phosphorylation along with Akt and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These data indicate that HGF
reduced sensitivity to gefitinib by restoring MET-mediated
phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 in cells harboring
wild-type EGFR, consistent with previous data examining
EGFR mutant lung cancer cells.
To investigate the relationship between EGFR, MET
and ErbB3, we immunoprecipitated MET and examined
its correlation with EGFR and ErbB3 in H358 cells. As
shown in Figure 2C, MET was not immunoprecipitated
with ErbB3, and neither gefitinib nor HGF induced an
association of these two molecules. Conversely, MET was
constitutively associated with EGFR, and this association
was inhibited by gefitinib, suggesting that the association
between EGFR and MET may be correlated by EGFR
phosphorylation status. Moreover, HGF treatment failed to

Gefitinib sensitivity was examined in the lung
cancer cell lines, H358 and A549, which express
wild-type EGFR. Both cell lines express a mutant KRAS
gene that is known as a marker of low sensitivity to EGFR
inhibition and chemotherapy [24]. As shown in Figure 1A,
cell viability of both H358 and A549 cells were modestly
inhibited by gefitinib. Treatment with HGF reduced the
sensitivity of both cell lines to gefitinib. The effect of
HGF was abrogated by pretreatment with an anti-HGF
neutralizing antibody but not control IgG (Figure 1B).

results indicate that HGF reduces sensitivity to gefitinib in

RNAi was used to determine whether MET was

siRNA did not affect either HGF-reduced sensitivity to
gefitinib (Figure 3A) or HGF-restored phosphorylation
of Akt and ERK1/2 in H358 or A549 cells (Figure 3B).

the proliferation of A549 cells. However, the inhibitory
growth effect of the MEK inhibitors was much less
pronounced in PC-9 cells, although phosphorylation levels
of ERK1/2 in both cell lines were inhibited (Figure 5B).
These results suggested that, in contrast to EGFR mutant
lung cancer cells, both PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling
pathways are essential in lung cancer cells with wild-type
EGFR.

Both PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways
are essential to gefitinib resistance in lung cancer
cells harboring wild-type EGFR

DISCUSSION

The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway has been reported
as a critical component in the acquired resistance to
gefitinib in EGFR mutant NSCLC cells [26–28]. Therefore,
we next sought to determine the importance of the PI3K
and MAPK downstream signaling pathways in lung cancer
cells with mutant or wild-type EGFR using PI3K inhibitors
and MEK inhibitors. The PI3K inhibitors, GSK2126458
and PF04691502, strongly inhibited the phosphorylation
of Akt. These agents significantly suppressed the
proliferation of wild-type EGFR A549 cells and
EGFR-mutant PC-9 cells (Figure 5A). The MEK inhibitors,

EGFR inhibitors have been recommended as the first
choice for patients with advanced NSCLC that express
EGFR activating mutations [29–31]. EGFR inhibitors can
also prolong survival in patients with NSCLC after failure
of chemotherapy regimens [20]. In the present study, we
showed that gefitinib modestly inhibited cell viability of
lung cancer cell lines, H358 and A549, through inhibition
of EGFR phosphorylation and the downstream signaling
molecules, Akt and ERK1/2. However, HGF reduced

of this study, lung cancers with wild-type EGFR are not
addicted to EGFR signal, in contrast to EGFR mutant cells.
Thus, at least in a group of lung cancers with wild-type
EGFR, combining EGFR inhibition with the inhibition
of other survival dependent signaling pathways might
be a better therapeutic strategy, similar to the successful
inhibition of lung cancers with EGFR mutations having
acquired resistance [36].
The KRAS mutation has been used as a predictive
marker of low sensitivity to EGFR-TKI in lung cancer
cells harboring EGFR activating mutations [37].
The mechanism of KRAS mutation related resistance
to EGFR-TKI has not been exclusively explained,
though many investigators propose that mutant KRAS
induces resistance to EGFR-TKI by activating MAPK
pathways [38]. In the present study, analysis of A549 and
H358 cells, which also express a KRAS mutant, further
confirmed this concept. In the experiments of inhibition
to downstream signaling pathways, PI3K inhibitors, but
not MEK inhibitors, effectively suppressed proliferation of
EGFR mutant PC-9 cells. In contrast, both PI3K inhibitors
and MEK inhibitors showed inhibitory effects on the
proliferation of A549 cells, indicating both downstream
signaling pathways are involved in the proliferation of
A549 cells.
In the present study, we found that HGF reduced

the sensitivity of these cells to gefitinib. Therefore,
the influence of resistant mechanisms to EGFR-TKI
sensitivity, such as high HGF levels, should be considered
to improve patient prognosis.
MET amplification has been reported to induce
gefitinib resistance via ErbB3 in EGFR mutant lung
cancers [15]. However, we and other investigators have
demonstrated that HGF induces gefitinib resistance
mediated by MET, without the involvement of ErbB3
[13, 25]. Consistent with previous findings in EGFR
mutant NSCLC, we found HGF suppressed sensitivity
to gefitinib via the MET pathway without association to
ErbB3 in wild-type EGFR NSCLC. Therefore, ligandstimulated MET activation induces different downstream
signals to gene amplification-stimulated MET activation in
both NSCLCs harboring mutant and wild-type EGFR. The
detailed mechanism of this difference needs to be clarified
in future studies.
Studies have shown that most lung adenocarcinomas
with wild-type EGFR were not highly sensitive to
EGFR-TKIs [32–34]. However, even in lung cancer
cells with wild-type EGFR, EGFR phosphorylation
was inhibited by gefitinib, accompanied by modestly
suppression of cell proliferation. Indeed, the firstgeneration of anti-EGFR therapies were all directed
against the wild-type receptor [35]. Based on the findings

the sensitivity to gefitinib, while the MET inhibitor,
PHA-665752, restored the sensitivity. MET inhibitors
have been researched in many clinical trials [39]. At
present, crizotinib, a dual inhibitor of EML4-ALK and
MET, already has been widely employed in lung cancer
patients harboring the EML4-ALK fusion [40]. Based on
our findings, crizotinib might be useful for this group of
patients with lung cancers harboring wild-type EGFR.
In summary, combined use of EGFR-TKI with a MET
inhibitor or inhibition of downstream signaling molecules,
such as PI3K or MEK, might be a better therapeutic
alternative for at least a part of advanced lung cancer
patients.

Duplexed StealthRNAi (Invitrogen) targeted to
MET and ErbB3 and Stealth RNAi Negative Control
Low GC Duplex #3 (Invitrogen) were used for the
RNA interference (RNAi) assay. The full-length HGF
cDNA was cloned into an expression vector and used
for the HGF gene transfection assay. One day before
transfection, aliquots of 2 × 104tumor cells in 400 µL of
antibiotic-free medium were plated into 24-well plates.
After incubation for 24 h, the cells were transfected with
small interfering RNA (siRNA; 50 µmol) or scramble
RNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (1 µL) in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 h incubation,
the cells were washed with PBS and plated into 96-well

and A549 were purchased from Immuno-Biological
Laboratories Co. and American Type Culture Collection,
respectively. The human lung adenocarcinoma cell
line PC-9 was purchased from Immuno-Biological
Laboratories Co. (Gunma, Japan). H358, A549, and PC-9
cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL
penicillin, and 100 units/mL streptomycin.
Gefitinib was obtained from AstraZeneca. Goat
anti-human HGF neutralizing antibody and control goat

Cell proliferation assay

HGF production

Cell proliferation was measured using the 3- (4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT)
dye reduction method. Tumor cells were plated at a density
of 2 × 103 cells/100 µL/well into 96-well plates in RPMI
1640 with 10% FBS. After 24-h incubation, various
concentrations of gefitinib, PHA-665752, and/or HGF
were added to each well, and incubation was continued
for an additional 72 h. Then, 50 µL of MTT solution
(2 mg/mL; Sigma) were added to all wells, and incubation
was continued for another 2 h. The media containing MTT
solution was removed, and the precipitated material was
dissolved by adding 100 µL of DMSO. The absorbance
was measured with a microplate reader at test and reference
wavelengths of 490 and 570 nm, respectively. The
percentage of growth is shown relative to untreated controls.

Cells (2 × 106) were cultured in RPMI 1640 with
10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were washed with PBS and
incubated for 48 h in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. Then,
culture medium was harvested and centrifuged, and
the supernatant was stored at –80°C until analysis. To
determine the levels of HGF secreted, ELISA was done
in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommended
procedures (Human HGF Quantikine ELISA. R & D
systems). All samples were run in triplicate. Color intensity
was measured at 450 nm. Growth factor concentrations
were determined by comparison with standard curves. The
detection limit was 40 pg/mL.

Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as the mean ± SDs of
experiments repeated at least three times. Significant
differences between the means were measured by a
two-tailed unpaired Student t test or one-way ANOVA.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
