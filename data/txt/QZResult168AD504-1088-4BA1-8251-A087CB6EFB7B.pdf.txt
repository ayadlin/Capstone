Abstract
The central role of Src in the development of several
malignancies, including breast cancer, and the accumulating
evidence of its interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases,
integrins, and steroid receptors have identified it as an
attractive therapeutic target. In the current study, we have
evaluated the effect of a Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, SKI-606, on
breast cancer growth, migration, invasion, and metastasis.
Treatment of human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 with
SKI-606 caused a marked inhibition of cell proliferation,
invasion, and migration by inhibiting mitogen-activated
protein kinase and Akt phosphorylation. For in vivo studies,
MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with the plasmid encoding
green fluorescent protein (GFP; MDA-MB-231-GFP) were
inoculated into the mammary fat pads of female BALB/c
nu/nu mice. Once tumor volume reached 30 to 50 mm3,
animals were randomized and treated with vehicle alone or
150 mg/kg SKI-606 by daily oral gavage. Experimental animals
receiving SKI-606 developed tumors of significantly smaller
volume (45–54%) compared with control animals receiving
vehicle alone. Analysis of lungs, liver, and spleen of these
animals showed a significant decrease in GFP-positive tumor
metastasis in animals receiving SKI-606 at a dose that was well
tolerated. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical
analysis of primary tumors showed that these effects were due
to the ability of SKI-606 to block tumor cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, growth factor expression, and inhibition of
Src-mediated signaling pathways in vivo. Together, the results
from these studies provide compelling evidence for the role of
Src inhibitors as therapeutic agents for blocking breast cancer
growth and metastasis. [Cancer Res 2007;67(4):1580–8]

Introduction
Src belongs to a non–receptor tyrosine kinase family that
comprises nine members in vertebrates (1). It is overexpressed in
several human cancers, including carcinomas of the breast, lung,
colon, esophagus, skin, parotid, cervix, as well as gastric tissues
(2–4). For breast cancer, increased Src activity is believed to play
an important role in its development and progression. Furthermore, elevated expression of Src has been associated with poor
prognosis (2). Src plays a role in several signaling pathways that
are involved in cell proliferation and survival (5). Additionally, the

ability of Src to promote tumor cell invasion can lead to the
development of tumor metastasis (6). Collectively, Src plays a
major role in regulating important mechanisms of specific
receptor pathways where their activation can influence the
biological activities of the tumor cell (1).
In the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling
pathway, phosphorylation of VE-cadherin on Tyr685 by Src plays
a pivotal role in regulating VE-cadherin adhesive activity (7).
In addition, Src has been shown to regulate phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase and Akt pathways (8). Several growth factors and
proteases, including parathyroid hormone-related protein
(PTHrP) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), can
serve as downstream targets for Src kinase (9, 10). In previous
studies, we have shown the role of PTHrP in tumor cell
proliferation, invasion, and metastasis and in the development of
hypercalcemia of malignancy in several common cancers,
including breast cancer (9, 11–14). It is important to note that
elevated PTHrP production, regulated by several oncogenes, such
as Ras, Tpr-Met, and Src, can activate osteoclastic bone
resorption, which leads to increased bone metastasis (11–14).
uPA, production of which is activated by Src, has been shown to
play a major role in the invasion, growth, and metastasis of
several malignancies, including breast cancer, due to its ability to
break down various components of the extracellular matrix
(15–17). Src has also been shown to interact with integrins that
are responsible for interaction between tumor cells and their
surrounding stroma, which can alter tumor cell growth,
differentiation, and migration (18, 19). Integrins can in turn
activate extracellular matrix proteins, such as focal adhesion
kinase (FAK). Autophosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397 enables the
recruitment of Src family tyrosine kinases by engaging their
Src homology 2 domains (20–22). Src can phosphorylate
additional sites in FAK, leading to the recruitment of the Grb-2
adapter molecule and in turn activation of several signaling
pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway (23).
Due to the important role of Src in tumor progression, studies
were carried out to evaluate the role of inhibition of Src in
reducing tumor growth (24). Duxbury et al. (25) have used the wellcharacterized pyrazolopyrimidines (PP2) to show their ability to
decrease pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic
xenograft model of pancreatic cancer. The purine analogue
AP23846 can inhibit members of the Src kinase family but has
not been advanced for clinical development. Nonetheless, both
interleukin-8 and VEGF expression were inhibited by AP23846 in
human solid tumor cell lines, lending further experimental support
to a role for Src kinase in tumor growth and angiogenesis (26). The
quinazoline compound AZM475271 has shown significant activity
in orthotopic models for pancreatic cancer (27). Another Src
inhibitor, SKI-606, was recently shown to be active in colon tumor

xenograft models in nude mice (28–33). This compound is also an
Abl kinase inhibitor and is active in chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML) models in vivo (34). Recently, Coluccia et al. (35) also
showed that SKI-606 decreases growth and motility of colorectal
cancer cells via inhibition of Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of h-catenin. Nam et al. (36) showed that dasatinib (BMS354825), a Src family kinase/Abl inhibitor, blocks the kinase
activities of Lyn, Src, and FAK signaling in human prostate cancer
cells. Collectively, these studies have shown the role of the Src
oncogene in several malignancies. In the current study, we have
evaluated the effect of Src kinase inhibition using SKI-606 on
breast cancer growth, invasion, and migration in vitro and on
tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Cells and cell culture. Human MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and BT-474
breast cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells transfected with GFP (MDA-MB-231GFP) were prepared and maintained in culture as described previously
(37–39).

In vitro cell assay and Western blotting. MDA-MB-231 cells
were plated in triplicate in six-well plates in the presence of 2% fetal
bovine serum with DMSO as vehicle alone or different concentrations
(0.1–1 Amol/L) of SKI-606 (33–35). Triplicate wells were trypsinized and
counted using a Coulter counter on alternate days (model ZF, Coulter
Electronics, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom). Cell culture
medium was replenished every 2nd day.
For cell migration assays, MDA-MB-231 cells (3  105 per well) were
plated in a six-well plate. Approximately 48 h later, when the cells were
100% confluent, the monolayer was scratched using a 1 mL pipette tip.
Medium and nonadherent cells were aspirated, the adherent cells were
washed once, and new medium containing various concentrations of SKI606 (0.1–100 Amol/L) was added for 4 h. Cells were observed under the
microscope at different times, and the inhibition of migration was assessed
when the wound in the control was closed.
Tumor cell invasive capacity was examined as described previously
(37, 38). After 18 h, the invading cells were then examined and counted in
10 randomly selected fields under a light microscope at 400 magnification. The average number of invading cells was then calculated.
For DNA fragmentation, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in six-well plates
(Falcon Plastics, London, Ontario, Canada). Cells were treated with SKI-606
(0.1–1.0 Amol/L) for up to 72 h. DNA from cells treated with vehicle alone

Figure 1. Effect of SKI-606 on MDA-MB-231 cell growth and invasion. A, MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at a density of 5  104 per well in six-well plates and
treated with different doses (0.1 and 1.0 Amol/L) of SKI-606. Control (CTL ) and experimental cells were trypsinized and counted with a Coulter counter as described
in Materials and Methods. Change in cell number at various time points. B, MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in culture as described in Materials and Methods. The
number of cells migrating to the lower aspect of the Boyden chamber filter 18 h after treatment with SKI-606 (0.1–1.0 Amol/L) was counted. The percentage of inhibition
in cell invasion was calculated by taking the number of invading cells following treatment with vehicle alone as control as 100%. C, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with
different doses (0.1–1.0 Amol/L) of SKI-606 and change in cell morphology was observed. Representative photomicrograph of vehicle-treated control cells and
cells treated with 1.0 Amol/L SKI-606. D, MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in the presence of vehicle alone or SKI-606 (1.0 Amol/L) for 96 h. DNA was isolated from
vehicle-treated control cells and SKI-606–treated cells as described in Materials and Methods. Isolated DNA was subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose
gel and visualized under UV light. Columns, mean of three experiments; bars, SE. *, P < 0.05, significant inhibition in cell invasion from control cells was determined
by ANOVA.

and SKI-606 was collected using a phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol
solution (50:48:2). Equal amounts of DNA were subjected to gel
electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. DNA fragmentation was visualized
by UV light using a transilluminator (40).
For Western blotting, MDA-MB-231 cells (1  106) were plated in 100mm Petri dishes for 24 h. Cells were then washed with cold PBS and lysed
with 200 AL of cold lysis buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.2 mmol/L
sodium vanadate, 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2% aprotinin].
Samples were kept on ice for 20 min and then spun at 13,000  g for
20 min, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were
determined. Cell lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and protein
was transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Expression of h-tubulin as
control was determined using anti-h-tubulin (NeoMarkers, BD Biosciences,
Mississauga, Ontario, Canada).

Animal protocols. For xenograft studies, 5-week-old (15–20 g) female
BALB/c nu/nu mice (Charles River, St. Constant, Quebec, Canada) were
used (37, 38). Before inoculation, MDA-MB-231-GFP cells grown in serum
containing culture medium were washed with Hank’s balanced buffer and
centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellets (5  105 per mouse) were
resuspended in 100 AL Matrigel (Becton Dickinson Labware, Mississauga,
Ontario, Canada) and saline mixture (20% Matrigel) and injected into the
mammary fat pad of mice s.c. All animals were numbered and kept
separately in a temperature-controlled room on a 12-h light/12-h dark
schedule with food and water ad libitum. Tumors were allowed to grow to
30 to 50 mm3. At this stage, animals were randomized and treated with
vehicle alone or different doses of SKI-606 (150 mg/kg/d) by oral gavage
5 days weekly for 5 weeks. Tumor volumes were determined from caliper
measurements obtained weekly. At the end of the study, animals were
sacrificed and their lung, liver, spleen, as well as the primary tumors were

removed for further analysis. Lung, liver, and spleen were sliced to 1-mmthick slices of fresh tissue for direct examination under the fluorescent
microscope for the presence of GFP-expressing tumor foci. The number of
GFP-expressing tumor foci per field of examination was counted from
10 random sites of five different slides for each organ and calculated and
graphed the average for each group. Total proteins from the primary
tumors were extracted for Western blot analysis to examine levels of Src,
phosphorylated Src, phosphorylated Akt, and phosphorylated MAPK in
these tumors. All animal protocols were in accordance with and approved
by the institutional review board.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical reactions were carried
out as previously described using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex
method (40–43). The antibodies used were polyclonal antiserum against
PTHrP (1–34) from rabbit (41), at 1:100, monoclonal antibodies against
E-cadherin (1:100), and CD31 (1:50) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.
(Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated Akt
(1:50) from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); monoclonal antibody
against Ki-67 (1:100) from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA); and monoclonal
antibody against uPA (1:50) from American Diagnostica, Inc. (Stanford, CT)
overnight at 4jC (39–41). Biotinylated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-mouse
antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) were used as the
secondary antibodies at 1:200 for 30 min at room temperature. The slides
were treated with Vectastain ABC-AP kit (Vector Laboratories) diluted 1:200
for 30 min at room temperature. The signals were visualized with Fast Red
TR/Naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Ontario, Canada)
containing 1 mmol/L levamisole for 10 to 15 min. The sections were then
lightly counterstained with hematoxylin (Fisher Scientific Ltd., Nepean,
Ontario, Canada) and mounted with Kaiser’s glycerol jelly. All sections were
washed thrice, 10 min each, with Tris buffer (pH 7.6) after each step.
Negative controls included substitution of the primary antibody with PBS.
For terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) assay, tissue sections were dewaxed by heating at 60jC
followed by washing in xylene and rehydrated through a graded series of
ethanol and water. Tissues were incubated with proteinase K for 30 min at
37jC, fixed, blocked, and permeabilized. Apoptotic cells were detected by
the TUNEL assay in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Molecular

Biochemicals, Laval, Quebec, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Positive TUNEL staining was visualized by fluorescence
microscopy (40).
Computer-assisted image analysis. The immunostaining of all antibodies was quantitatively analyzed by using a computer-assisted image
analysis system as described previously (42, 43). Briefly, images of stained
sections were captured with a Leica digital camera (Richmond Hill, Ontario,
Canada) and processed using BioQuant image analysis software version
6.50.10 (BioQuant Image Analysis Corp., Nashville, TN). The threshold was
set by determining the positive staining of control cells and was used to
automatically analyze all recorded images of all samples that were stained
in the same session under identical conditions. The area of immunostained
regions in each microscopic field was calculated automatically by the
software. Pixel counts of the immunoreaction product were calculated
automatically and were given as total density of the integrated
immunostaining over a given area of the well. This reflects the relative
amount of proteins detected by the antibodies on cells.
Statistical analysis. Results are expressed as the mean F SE of at least
triplicate determinations, and statistical comparisons are based on
Student’s t test and ANOVA. A probability value of <0.05 was considered
to be significant.

Results
Effects of SKI-606 on cell proliferation, invasion, and
migration. SKI-606 is a potent dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor that
was shown to have antiproliferative effects on CML cells; however,
the efficacy of SKI-606 in breast cancer is still unknown. Therefore,
we determined the effect of SKI-606 on the growth of mesenchymal-like human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231. Treatment of
these breast cancer cells with SKI-606 caused a dose-dependent
inhibition in tumor cell proliferation (Fig. 1A). The effect of SKI-606
on tumor cell invasive capacity was evaluated by Matrigel invasion
assay. The results of these studies show that SKI-606 inhibits the
invasive capacity of MBA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent

immunoprecipitation (IP ) with Src antibody and Western blot analysis for Src-Tyr416. B, MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested at different time points (0 and 2 h) following
treatment with 1.0 Amol/L SKI-606. Western blot analysis was carried out with 40 Ag of total protein loaded in each lane and immunoblotted with antibodies
against MAPK, phosphorylated MAPK (pMAPK ), FAK, phosphorylated FAK (pFAK ), Akt, and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt ). Anti-h-tubulin antibody was used as loading
control. Levels of expression of MAPK, phosphorylated MAPK, FAK, phosphorylated FAK, Akt, and phosphorylated Akt were quantified by densitometric scanning
and expressed as relative density. Columns, mean of three experiments; bars, SE. *, P < 0.05, significant change in phosphorylated MAPK and phosphorylated
Akt production was determined by Student’s t test.

manner (Fig. 1B). Anti-invasive effects of SKI-606 are independent
of its effect on cell proliferation, which was observed following
48 h of treatment with SKI-606. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells
with 0.1 to 1.0 Amol/L SKI-606 for 2 h caused a morphologic change
from a spindle-like phenotype to an epithelial and condensed shape
(Fig. 1C). We also examined the ability of SKI-606 to induce tumor
cell apoptosis by DNA ladder formation assay. Treatment of MDAMB-231 cells with 1.0 Amol/L SKI-606 at 96 h caused a significant
induction of apoptosis in vitro (Fig. 1D).
To assess whether SKI-606 affects cell migration, a woundhealing assay was done. Following treatment with various
concentrations of SKI-606 for 4 h, cells were allowed to migrate
into the denuded area for 16, 24, and 48 h. SKI-606 at 1.0 Amol/L
concentration caused a significant decrease in MDA-MB-231 cell
migration (Fig. 2). Ability of SKI-606 to inhibit cell migration at all
time points suggests that these effects are not due to its ability to
inhibit cell proliferation, which was only seen after 48 h of
treatment. We also examined the effect of SKI-606 on the invasion

and migration of two additional human breast cancer cells (MCF-7
and BT-474). In these cells, which are low invasive, treatment with
SKI-606 caused a statistically significant inhibition in cell invasion
and migration compared with cells treated with vehicle alone.
However, the ability of SKI-606 to inhibit tumor cell invasion and
migration was significantly lower compared with the highly
invasive MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown).
SKI-606 inhibits kinase activity of Src and its downstream
signaling pathways in vitro. Tyr416 in the kinase domain plays a
critical role in the regulation of Src tyrosine kinase activity. MDAMB-231 cells were treated with 1.0 Amol/L SKI-606 for 2 h, a dose
and time that is most effective in inhibiting cell proliferation,
invasion, and migration as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. At the end of
this incubation period, cell lysates were subjected to Western blot
analysis to determine Src kinase activity. These studies showed
that SKI-606 can inhibit kinase activity as measured by
autophosphorylation of Tyr416 in these human breast cancer cells
(Fig. 3A).

A, MDA-MB-231-GFP cells (5  105) were

vehicle alone as control or 150 mg/kg
SKI-606 5 d weekly for 4 wks by daily oral
gavage. Tumor volumes were determined
by caliper measurements obtained weekly
as described in Materials and Methods.
B, to determine the effect of SKI-606 on
tumor metastasis, at the end of these
studies, control and experimental animals
treated with SKI-606 were sacrificed.
Various organs (lungs, liver , and spleen )
were removed and evaluated for the
presence of metastatic tumor cells.
A number of tumor foci in 10 random fields
per slide, five slides per organ, were
counted to determine the average number
of tumor foci in each of the organs as
described in Materials and Methods.

cells (5  105) were implanted in the mammary fat pads of female BALB/c

randomized and treated with vehicle alone as control or 150 mg/kg SKI-606 by
daily oral gavage. At the end of this treatment, tumors were removed and
protein lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies
against MAPK, phosphorylated MAPK, FAK, phosphorylated FAK, Akt, and
phosphorylated Akt. Protein lysates were also immunoblotted using antibodies
against Src levels and Src phosphorylated Tyr416. Membranes were stripped
and reblotted for h-tubulin as control for protein loading as described in
Materials and Methods. Levels of expression of phosphorylated Src, Src,
MAPK, phosphorylated MAPK, FAK, phosphorylated FAK, Akt, and
phosphorylated Akt were quantified by densitometric scanning and expressed

To confirm the loss of Src activity, we examined the effect of Src
inhibition on downstream signaling proteins, such as MAPK, FAK,
and Akt. Results shown in Fig. 3B show that SKI-606 acts as an
inhibitor of these signaling pathways by inhibiting phosphorylation
of these proteins, findings which are consistent with the antiinvasive effect shown in Fig. 1B.
Role of SKI-606 in MDA-MB-231 tumor growth and
metastasis in vivo. Previously, we had generated MDA-MB-231
cells stably transfected with a plasmid containing cDNA encoding
GFP. These MDA-MB-231-GFP cells, which have similar cell
proliferation and invasive capacity as the wild-type cells, allow
for the determination of the number and size of microscopic GFPpositive tumor cells in various organs (lungs, liver, and spleen;
refs. 37, 38). To test the effect of SKI-606 on tumor growth and
metastasis, MDA-MB-231-GFP cells were inoculated into the
mammary fat pad of female BALB/c nu/nu mice. Once the tumor
volume reached 30 to 50 mm3, animals were randomized and
treated with vehicle alone or SKI-606 (150 mg/kg) by daily oral
gavage 5 days weekly for 4 weeks. Tumor volumes were determined
by caliper measurements obtained weekly. The control group of
animals treated with vehicle alone showed a progressive increase in
their tumor volume; however, experimental animals treated with
SKI-606 developed tumors of significantly smaller volume (P < 0.05)
throughout the course of these studies (Fig. 4A).
To determine the efficacy of SKI-606 treatment on the ability
of MDA-231-GFP cells to metastasize in vivo, at the end of these
studies, control and experimental animals were sacrificed and
various organs (lung, liver, and spleen) were removed and
evaluated for the presence of GFP-positive tumor cells. Using
fluorescent microscopy for the analysis of slices of fresh tissue
from lung, liver, and spleen, we were able to show the presence
of GFP-expressing tumor foci recognized by their green
fluorescence. Results clearly show that animals inoculated with
MDA-MB-231-GFP cells and treated with SKI-606 developed
microscopic tumor metastases of significantly smaller number
and size compared with control animals receiving vehicle alone
(Fig. 4B).
Effects of SKI-606 on Src-mediated signaling pathway
in vivo. To investigate the effect of Src inhibition on signaling
pathways in vivo, control and experimental MDA-MB-231-GFP
tumors were collected at the time of necropsy and snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tumors were grinded in liquid
nitrogen. The mice were treated with SKI-606 at a concentration
of 150 mg/kg via oral gavage following inoculation of MDA-MB231-GFP cells in the mammary fat pad. Consistent with the
results of our in vitro studies, SKI-606 markedly abolished
phosphorylation of phosphorylated Src, phosphorylated MAPK,
phosphorylated FAK, and phosphorylated Akt signaling proteins
(Fig. 5).
Effects of SKI-606 on gene expression, tumor cell survival,
proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis in vivo. Because Src
can regulate multiple signaling pathways and gene expression,
control and experimental tumors were evaluated for the expression
of genes involved in tumor progression. Immunohistochemical
analysis of primary tumors treated with vehicle alone or SKI-606
showed a significant decrease in PTHrP and uPA expression, genes
which are known to promote breast cancer progression. In
contrast, treatment with SKI-606 showed increased expression of
E-cadherin, which suggests the ability of SKI-606 to affect tumor
cell adhesion (Fig. 6). Furthermore, as shown previously, SKI-606
inhibits Akt activity through the PIK3 pathway, which results in

Effect of SKI-606 on Tumor Progression

Discussion
SKI-606 is an effective Src kinase inhibitor that blocks the
activity of various signaling pathways, such as MAPK and Akt, at
micromolar concentrations. This effect was tested on mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231, which exhibit high
invasive capacity. SKI-606 showed antiproliferative effects and
inhibited cell migration and invasion, which directly correlate with
a significant (45–54%) reduction in tumor volume in experimental
animals (Fig. 4A). Src phosphorylation at Tyr416 was significantly
reduced in MDA-MB-231 tumors from animals treated with SKI606. Furthermore, we showed that blockade of Src results in
decreased expression of both PTHrP and uPA, which are known to
promote the growth and metastasis of several common cancers,
including breast cancer (12–17). Ability of SKI-606 to inhibit the
expression of these genes is significant because they are regulated
by Src oncogene and via the MAPK and Akt signaling pathways
play an important role in breast cancer invasion and metastasis
(12–17). Additionally, the ability of SKI-606 to affect tumor cell
proliferation and angiogenesis as shown in Fig. 6 plays a significant
role in antitumor and antimetastatic effects of SKI-606 as shown in
this study.
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells are highly invasive and
representative of cells in late-stage breast cancer. In agreement
with previous studies with colorectal tumor xenografts where SKI606 showed an antitumor effect, it showed a significant inhibition
of MDA-MB-231 tumor growth and metastasis in the current study
(27, 28). Therefore, this Src/Abl kinase inhibitor is effective in both
types (colorectal and breast) of tumors. Furthermore, MDA-MB231 cell invasive capacity was also diminished in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 1B). Change in tumor cell morphology combined with
increased expression of E-cadherin points to the potential role of
Src inhibition in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which needs
in-depth investigation to fully understand the mode of action of
these selective inhibitors. Cell migration is necessary in many
physiologic processes, such as tissue development, wound healing,
and tumor metastasis. Several studies suggested that Src might be
involved in cell migration. Indeed, in src / mice fibroblasts,
locomotion is reduced compared with rates displayed by wild-type
fibroblasts (44). Consistent with those findings, SKI-606-mediated
inhibition of Src activity impeded cell migration after 4 h of

treatment (Fig. 2). These findings correlate with the reduction of
uPA levels, which is associated with inhibition of cell adhesion and
migration. Phosphorylation of Tyr416 in the kinase domain is a
critical activation step in the regulation of Src tyrosine kinase
activity (1, 45, 46). On addition of SKI-606, we show clearly that Src
phosphorylation at Tyr416 is inhibited in MDA-MB-231 cells as well
as in tumor lysates of experimental animals. These findings suggest
that SKI-606 is acting through inhibition of Src kinase activity. In
addition, Src regulates many cellular events through phosphorylation of multiple substrates. We investigated whether downstream
signaling pathways would be altered through an inactivation of
Src. Our data clearly show a decrease in phosphorylation of MAPK
and Akt pathway. This change was observed at 2 h of treatment
with SKI-606 and correlated with the findings in vivo.
More recently, using a xenograft model of breast cancer metastasis, Src (tyrosine kinase) activity was shown to be associated with
tumor cell colonization in bone (47). Furthermore, Src (tyrosine
kinase) stimulated the production of PTHrP at transcriptional
levels in MDA-MB-231, which in turn can activate bone resorption
by osteoclasts, leading to the progression of bone metastases (47).
In this study, we examined metastasis in lung, liver, and spleen. Our
results show that, in the organs of treated animals, the number of
MDA-MB-231-GFP cells is reduced compared with the control
animals.
In conclusion, we show in this study that SKI-606 inhibits
metastasis and breast tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model.
It is important to note that E-cadherin levels were increased in
SKI-606-treated tumor. This is in accordance to the recent study
where Nam et al. (36) showed that PP2 is also capable of
restoring E-cadherin/h-catenin in various tumor cell lines.
Collectively, results from these studies have provided compelling
evidence for continued evaluation of the efficacy of SKI-606 in
breast cancer.
