ABSTRACT
Inhibitors of the mTOR pathway, such as everolimus, are promising compounds to
treat patients with renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). However, the precise mechanisms of
action are far from clear, and biomarkers predicting the response to mTOR inhibitors
are still missing. Here, we provide evidence that in RCCs the rpS6 protein is the major
mediator of anti-tumoral effects exerted by everolimus. Inhibition of mTOR signaling
results in substantially decreased clonogenicity and proliferation of RCC cells, but did
not significantly induce apoptosis. Everolimus effectively blocked protein biosynthesis
both in vitro and in a novel ex vivo tissue slice model using fresh vital human RCC
tissue. Compared to other components of the mTOR pathway, phosphorylation of rpS6
was most effectively downregulated by everolimus. Importantly, siRNA-mediated
downregulation of rpS6, but not of 4ebp1 or p27, abolished the inhibitory effects of
everolimus on proliferation and protein synthesis. Moreover, we analyzed the tissue
expression of phosphorylated rpS6 (p-rpS6) and non-phosphorylated rpS6 in a large
collection of patients with RCCs (n=598 and n=548, respectively). Expression of both
proteins qualified as independent negative prognostic markers with a substantially
shorter survival of patients with RCCs exhibiting high levels of rpS6 and p-rpS6.
Taken together, our functional studies identified rpS6 as a main mediator of the antitumoral activity of Everolimus. Therefore, further (pre-)clinical evaluations of rpS6 as
a predictive marker for everolimus-based treatment for RCC patients are warranted.
Finally, the combined detection of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated rpS6 could
represent a robust prognostic marker to identify patients with high risk RCCs.

INTRODUCTION

almost all patients during the course of treatment are still
serious shortcomings of this novel targeted therapeutic
approaches. The therapeutic inhibition of the mTOR
signaling pathway is clinically achieved by analogues
of rapamycin, such as Temsirolimus (CCI-779) and
Everolimus (RAD001). Temsirolimus is recommended as
first line therapy in clear cell carcinoma with poor risk
and non-clear cell carcinoma in any risk constellation.
Everolimus is recommended for clear-cell carcinoma after
VEGF-R based therapies (second and third line therapy)

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a prototype of a
chemoresistant and radioresistant malignant tumor, and
therapeutic possibilities for metastasized disease have
been limited until recently. The introduction of tyrosinekinase inhibitors and mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitors was a major breakthrough in treatment
of RCCs, although primary resistance in a subgroup of
patients and development of secondary resistance in

and as third line therapy after two different TKI [1, 2].
Second and third line treatment with mTOR inhibitors
leads to partial response in 3-17% and stable disease in 4070% of patients [3]. The median time to treatment failure
for mTOR inhibitors (second line setting) is 2.5 months
[4]. In this regard, further progress in the understanding of
the molecular mechanisms of mTOR inhibition as well as
novel diagnostic tools to identify patients that will respond
to targeted therapy are urgently needed.
The mTOR protein complex functions as a
serine/threonine kinase that is mainly activated by the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling
pathway and plays a pivotal role in control of cell
cycle, proliferation and cellular survival both in normal
renal tubules and in renal cell carcinoma [5] [6] [7].
Downstream mediators of mTOR are the 70 kDa
ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), the translational
repressor 4EBP1, HIF1A, p27, and Bcl-2 [8, 9]. By
activating or inhibiting these targets, mTOR regulates
protein synthesis, translation, cell cycle, and apoptosis.
The serine/threonine kinase p70S6K can regulate protein
synthesis and translation by activating the ribosomal
protein S6 (rpS6), but has also other downstream effectors,
such as eEF2K, eIF4B, and the GSK3-BAD axis which
regulates cell survival [10]. However, despite this
knowledge the precise contribution of these downstream
targets of mTOR to the success or failure of a mTOR
inhibitor-based treatment of RCCs is not well understood.
Moreover, the identification of the main mediators of
the anti-tumor effects of mTOR inhibitors are of great
importance regarding the development of diagnostic
techniques to predict the response of individual patients to
targeted therapy. This would enable physicians to stratify
patients for tailored therapy concepts, increase the invidual
benefit from treatment, and prevent unwanted side effects
in patients who are not responsive to treatment. Therefore,
the aim of our study was to identify crucial mediators of
mTOR inhibition in both in vitro and ex vivo models of
RCCs. Further, we investigated the potential of mTOR
pathway components as prognostic biomarkers in a large
collection of patients with RCCs.

HK2 (which is an immortalized proximal tubule epithelial
cell line) and A704 (Figure 1B). Since Everolimus was
also reported to induce apoptosis in cancer cells [11,
12], we tested the viability of RCC cells after a 48 h
treatment with Everolimus. However, viability was only
marginally affected and substantial induction of apoptosis
was not observed (Figure 1C). Thus, Everolimus inhibits
clonogenicity and proliferation in RCC cells without
significant induction of apoptosis.

Everolimus inhibitis protein synthesis in longterm cultured RCC cells as well as in ex vivo tissue
samples
Since mTOR signaling plays a central role for
biosynthesis of proteins we examined to which extent
Everolimus affects protein synthesis in RCC cells by
a 35S-methionine protein labelling assay. Everolimus
treatment induced a strong inhibition of protein synthesis
in 796P and Caki2 RCC cell lines, whereas the inhibitory
effect was minor in HK2 cells (Figure 2A). Next, we
extended our in vitro monolayer cell culture studies by
a 3D tumor model accounting for the in vivo complexity
of human RCC tissue. To this end, we generated 300
µm thick slices from vital, fresh tumor tissue of RCC
patients and incubated the tissue with Everolimus. In
accordance with the in vitro data, Everolimus strongly
inhibited protein synthesis in the tumor tissue (Figure
2B). In contrast, Everolimus-dependent inhibition of
protein synthesis was only moderate in the corresponding
normal tissue. Thus, Everolimus substantially blocked
synthesis of proteins in RCC both in vitro and ex vivo,
providing a possible explanation for the inhibitory effects
on proliferation and clonogenicity.

Expression of mTOR pathway components in
RCC cell lines and modification by Everolimus
In order to functionally investigate the mTOR
pathway we characterized the expression of mTOR
pathway components in several RCC cell lines by
immunoblot analysis (Figure 3). mTOR and rpS6 were
expressed in all cell lines tested, and treatment of cells
with the mTOR inhibitor Everolimus did not substantially
alter the overall expression levels. In contrast, the
phosphorylation of rpS6 (p-rpS6) was completely
blocked by Everolimus. As a control, cells were treated
with leucine which acts as an activator of mTOR by
Rheb-dependent stimulation of the mTORC1 kinase
activity [13]. Total protein levels of 4ebp1, a translational
repressor, were not significantly altered by Everolimus or
leucine. However, phosphorylation of 4ebp1 (p-4ebp1)
was increased upon leucin treatment. Everolimus
treatment resulted in a non-consistent moderate up- or
down-regulation of p-4ebp1. No significant regulation

RESULTS
Characterization of cellular effects of Everolimus
In order to functionally investigate the cellular
effects of everolimus we examined clonogenicity,
proliferation, and viability in a panel of different human
RCC cells. Treatment with Everolimus resulted in a
strong inhibition of clonogenicity (Figure 1A). In the
most sensitive cell line, Caki2, number of colonies were
reduced to 25% of control cells. Similarly, Everolimus
significantly reduced proliferation in most cell lines except

Everolimus. Importantly, the down-regulation of rpS6
completely abolished a further Everolimus-dependent
inhibition of proliferation, whereas p27- and 4ebp1downregulated cells were still susceptible to the inhibitory
effects of Everolimus (Figure 4A). Accordingly, siRNAmediated suppression of rpS6 blocked a further inhibitory
effect of Everolimus on protein synthesis (Figure 4B).
These results indicate that rpS6 plays a central role in
mediating the inhibitory effects of Everolimus on mTOR
signaling in RCC cells.

As a next step, we investigated which of the mTOR
downstream targets is most important for the mediation
of the inhibitory Everolimus effects. Therefore, we

approach and subsequently treated the RCC cells with

mTOR forms two distinct complexes, named mTORC1
and mTORC2, whereas mTORC1 but not mTORC2 is
inhibited by rapamycin analogs. The mTORC1 pathway
regulates major cellular functions, like proliferation or
protein synthesis [20]. Downstream targets of mTOR
signaling pathways are, among others, p70S6K, HIF1A,
and 4E-BP1. The protein kinase p70S6K phosphorylates
several downstream substrates, such as rpS6, and thereby
promotes protein synthesis [21].
In our study, the mTOR inhibitor Everolimus
mainly affected clonogenicity and proliferation of RCC
cells, without substantial impact on cell death pathways.
Although Everolimus was reported to induce apoptosis
in leucemia cells [22], significant triggering of apoptotic
cell death was not observed in our RCC model. Since
Everolimus universally inhibits mTORC1, the differential
apoptosis response might be caused by its varying effects
on Akt dependent on cell and tissue type [23]. The major
inhibitory effect of Everolimus on protein synthesis was
confirmed both in vitro and ex vivo. Our innovative ex
vivo tissue slice model allowed us to directly study the
effects of Everolimus on human vital RCC tissue while
maintaining the original tumor-stroma interaction. In
this model, Everolimus substantially inhibited protein
synthesis in RCC tissue, whereas the inhibitory effect on
non-tumor tissue was much weaker. This finding points
to a higher dependency on the mTOR pathway in tumor
samples.
One important result of our study is the crucial
functional relevance of rpS6 in mediating the antitumor effects of Everolimus. The siRNA-mediated
downregulation of rpS6, but not of 4ebp1 or p27, abolished
the inhibitory effects on proliferation and protein synthesis
of Everolimus. In contrast, the functionality of 4ebp1 to
repress translation could be taken over by its counterpart
4ebp2 and therefore compensate for its loss. Functional
redundancy exists also for the cell cycle inhibitor
p27, e.g. by the other Kip/Cip proteins p21 and p57.
Although the importance of the protein kinase p70S6K
for mTOR-mediated cellular effects is well established,
the contribution of the various downstream effectors of
p70S6K, such as rpS6 and others, is far from clear. Other
effectors modulate protein synthesis (eEF2K, eIF4B,
Pdcd4), cytoskeletal rearrangement, proliferation, splicing,
cell survival and an mTOR feedback loop [24].
Importantly, the central functional role of rpS6
opens up the possibility to exploit the measurement
of rpS6 expression levels as a predictive biomarker
that prognosticates whether a tumor will respond to
pharmaceutical mTOR inhibition or not. A limited
number of studies addressed this question. Iwenofu et al.
identified p-rpS6 in a group of 20 patients with high grade
metastatic sarcoma as an marker for early clinical response
to AP23573 treatment (an mTOR inhibitor). Highly p-rpS6
expressing tumor samples showed stable disease after
two cycles of therapy, low expressing tumors showed

Similar results were obtained for the histological subgroup
of clear-cell RCC (Suppl. Tables 5 and 6).
p-rpS6
Elevated p-rpS6 expression levels were observed
in the tumor tissue of 125 patients (21%). High p-rpS6
expression levels were significantly associated with tumor
extent, regional lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis,
and grade of malignancy (Table 2; for an analysis of
localized vs. metastasized cases see Suppl. Table 1 and
2). Univariate survival analyses showed that high rpS6
expression is associated with a poor clinical outcome in
patients with RCC (p < 0.001, Figure 6B, cancer-specific
survival; for an analysis of progression-free survival see
Suppl. Figure 1B; for an analysis of only clear-cell RCC
see Suppl. Figure 2B). Multivariate Cox analysis identified
p-rpS6 as a significant prognostic factor in the whole
patient group (Table 3, cancer-specific survival: 1.4 [11.9], p = 0.03) and patients with metastatic disease (Suppl.
Table 4, cancer-specific survival: 1.6 [1-2.5], p = 0.03;
Suppl. Table 3, progression-free survival: 1.6 [1-2.5], p
= 0.03). Similar results were obtained for the histological
subgroup of clear-cell RCC (Suppl. Tables 5 and 6).
In patients with RCC expressing both high rpS6
and p-rpS6 levels, survival times were even shorter
(cancer-specific survival: Figure 6C; for an analysis of
progression-free survival see Suppl. Figure 1C; for an
analysis of only clear-cell RCC see Suppl. Figure 2C).
Multivariate analysis identifies the combination of both
markers as prognostic relevant in the whole patient group
(Table 3, cancer-specific survival: 1.9 [1.4-2.4], p < 0.001;
Suppl. Table 3, progression-free survival: 1.8 [1.3-2.4], p
< 0.001), patients with localized (Suppl. Table 4, cancerspecific survival: 1.9 [1.2-2.9], p = 0.007; Suppl. Table
3, progression-free survival: 1.7 [1.1-2.6], p = 0.013) and
patients with metastasized disease (Suppl. Table 4, cancerspecific survival: 2.4 [1.6-3.9], p < 0.001; Suppl. Table 3,
progression-free survival: 2.4 [1.6-3.9], p < 0.001).

DISCUSSION
Despite recent advances in systemic therapy of
metastasized RCC, most patients are not cured and only
32% of patients treated with Temsirolimus showed clinical
benefit, defined as objective response or stable disease > =
24 weeks [16]. Treatment with Everolimus leads to partial
response in 14%, and stable disease in 73 % and 57 %
after three and six months [17]. The application of targeted
therapies is so far not guided by biomarkers. Thus, the
development of predictive biomarkers is a priority in
translational research in RCC to permit rational tailored
treatment of individual patients.
Temsirolimus (CCI-779) and Everolimus (RAD001)
are rapamycin derivatives and form a complex with the
12-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) that inhibits
mTOR signaling [18] [19]. Along with several proteins,

progressive disease [25]. In RCCs, Cho et al. showed
that immunohistochemical detection of p-rpS6 may have
predictive potential for treatment with mTOR inhibitors.
Tissue samples of 20 patients were stained for p-rpS6 and
subsets of them for CA IX, p-Akt and PTEN. Partial or
minimal response to Temsirolimus was associated with
high p-rpS6 expression (p = 0.02) [26]. Li et al. confirmed
p-rpS6 as a potential predictive marker (n = 18, improved
PFS) and identified p-mTOR as an additional marker [27].
However, due to the limited study population results were
preliminary and have to be confirmed by further studies.
On the other hand, baseline amounts of PTEN and HIF1α are not usable as predictive markers in Temsirolimus
treated RCCs [28].
Since it is difficult to recruit enough eligible patients
for a well designed study with sufficient statistical power
that addresses the question of predicting mTOR inhibitor
efficacy, future multicentric trials will have to validate the
predictive power of rpS6 expression in a clinical setting.
In any case, the results presented in this paper warrant a
further evaluation of rpS6 as a companion diagnostic for
the therapeutic use of mTOR inhibitors.
Although the identification of a predictive biomarker
for targeted therapies is clinically most urgently required,
in the case of RCCs there is also a medical need for
reliable prognostic markers that are able to distinguish
high risk from low risk patients. Patients who are at high
risk for relapse or metastasis could be monitored more
closely and offered more aggressive therapies or the
inclusion into clinical trials. Therefore, we studied the
expression of rpS6 and p-rpS6 in a large collection of RCC
patients and compared the expression levels with clinical
and pathological features. We found that high expression
of rpS6 or p-rpS6 is associated with high grade RCCs.
Furthermore, univariate and multivariate survival analyses
showed that high expression of either one is associated
with a poor clinical outcome in patients. Importantly, the
combined assessment of rpS6 and p-rpS6 expression could
further improve the prognostic significance. Since the
immunohistochemical assessment of protein expression
levels for prognostic and/or predictive purposes is already
in clinical use in other tumor types (e.g. hormone receptors
and proliferative activity in breast cancer), the analysis
of rpS6 and p-rpS6 for prognostication of RCC patients
seems feasible. Taken together, rpS6 and p-rpS6 represent
promising candidates for prognostic and predictive
biomarkers in patients with RCCs, and their possible
clinical usage should be further validated by future
investigations.

Cell culture
Human RCC cell lines 769-P, 786-O, Caki-2,
ACHN, A704, 293T and HK-2 were purchased from
ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). These celllines where
authenticated by ATCC through short tandem repeat
profiling. Cells where cultured for at most 10 passages
at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere and maintained in

MD, USA) with additional 10% fetal calf serum, 1
mM glutamine, 25 mM glucose and 1 % penicillin/

Endogenous protein was specifically knocked down
transiently by transfecting cell lines with short interfering
RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides at concentration of 10 nM
(p27 and 4ebp1) and 20 nM (rpS6) using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Three different
rpS6 siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette,
CO, USA) and Santa Crus (Dallax, TX, USA): #J-00302411, #J-003472-07, #sc-36424. Other siRNAs used were
obtained from Dharmacon as well: #J-003472-07 against
p27 and #J-003005-13 against 4ebp1. Non-specific siRNA
was used as a control (#D-001810-10).

Immunoblot analysis
Ice-cold PBS was used to rinse cells, followed by
lysis with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120
mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0,5% Triton X-100) containing
PMSF (1 mM), proteinase inhibitors (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany, #1697498) and phosphatase inhibitors (10
mM NaPPi, 200 µM NaVO3, 25 mM NaF). Incubation
for 15 min on ice was followed by centrifugation of
lysates at 16 000 g for 20 min. Bradford Assays (BioRad, Munich, Germany) were used to measure protein
concentrations. For electrophoresis, 20-40 µg of protein
was separated with 10-15% polyacrylamid gels and
blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) by
standard procedures. Membranes where washed, incubated
over night with primary antibody, washed again and
incubated with secondary antibody (1:3000) coupled
to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Visualization was
performed by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection
system (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany). Following
primary antibodies were used: anti-beta-Actin (Sigma,
Deisenhofen, Clone AC15, A5441), anti-4ebp1 (Cell

membranes, suspended in six-well plates and cultured in
DMEM supplemented with penicillin (100 U/ml, Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and steptomycin (100
mg/ml, Sigma Aldrich) in a conventional CO2 incubator.
Slices were then incubated in 10 µM Everolimus for
72 h. Approvement of the local ethics committee of
the University Hospital of Heidelberg, Germany, was
acquired for usage of tumor tissue for research purposes.
Anonymization of the data was performed prior to analysis
of the data and written consent from the donors or the next
of kin obtained for the use of these samples in research.

Cytotoxicity assays
104 cells were plated in 96-well plates, adhered for
24 h and treated with Everolimus for 72 h. The surviving
ratio was assessed by staining with crystal violet [29].
After removing of the supernatant, the cells were
incubated in 2% crystal violet solution in 20% methanol
for 10 min. After washing in running-tap water the plates
were air-dried for 24 h. The portion of bound crystal
violet was solubilized by the addition of a 0.1 M sodium
citrate buffer in 50% ethanol. Absorption was measured
at 550 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Munich,
Germany).

S-methionine labeling

35

Protein synthesis was assessed through labeling of
cells with the beta-emitting radioisotope 35S-methionine.
Cells were treated with 1 µM Everolimus in Methionine
depleted RMPI medium, followed by addition of
radioactive 35S-methionine for one hour. They were then
lysed in 0.2N NaOH, part of which was used for Lowry
protein concentration measurement [31]. BSA and 50 %
trichloracetic acid was added, the sample 10 min incubated
on ice followed by centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for 5 min.
After addition of 0.25N NaOH, 1.25 N trichloracetatacid
and ULTIMA GoldTM the sample was measured in a
scintillation counter (Packard TriCarb 2900, Meriden,
IL). Tissue samples were incubated in 10 µM Everolimus
in standard RPMI for 72h and labeled with radioactive
35
S-methionine for 2 h.

FACS
FACS measurements of propidium iodid dyed
cells and their supernatants were performed with a PAS
II Flowmeter (Partec, Munich, Germany) to assess the
amount of vital cells and their cell cycle distribution.
Cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min and Nicoletti
agens added (0.1 % Na-Citrat, 0.1 % Triton X-100, pH
7.4). Data was acquired and analysed with the MultiCycle
software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA, USA).

Proliferation assay

Patients

Assessment of proliferation was performed in
96-well plates. 104 cells were seeded, adhered for 24
hours and treated with BrdU for 48h (Amersham Cell
Proliferation Kit, RPN250, GE Healthcare, Solingen).
Incubation with an enzyme-linked antibody against BrdU
followed, which allowed photometrical quantification of
incorporated BrdU at 450 nm.

Tissue samples from 838 patients with primary
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated at the Department of
Urology at the University of Heidelberg between 1987
and 2005 were collected. The human tissue samples
were provided by the Tumor Tissue Bank of the NCT
Heidelberg after approval by the ethics committee of the
University of Heidelberg (ethics approval number: 206
/ 2005). Clinical follow-up was available for all cases.
Patients were prospectively evaluated every 3 months for
the first 2 years after treatment, every 6 months for the
next 3 years, and yearly thereafter (chest x-ray or thoracic
CT scan; abdominal sonography or CT scan or MRI;
serum chemistry). Survival was calculated from the date
of nephrectomy until last visit or death. Follow-up was
performed according to the guidelines. All tissue samples
were reviewed by experienced pathologists. The tumors
were graded according to the 4-tiered nuclear grading
system [32] and pathologically staged based on the TNM

Clonogenicity assays
500 cells were seeded into 6-well culture dishes and
incubated for seven days (14 days for cell lines ACHN and
A704) prior to crystal violet staining and colony counting
with ClonoCounter [30].

Ex vivo tissue slice technique
Fresh human renal cell carcinoma tissue samples
were obtained from the Tissue Bank of the Center for

classification (2002). A tissue micro array containing 838
primary and corresponding normal tissue samples was
created. All cases of RCC were centrally reviewed by an
experienced GU pathologist (S.M.G.). Sections were cut
from representative donor blocks for the tissue microarray,
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Afterwards,
morphologically representative regions were chosen from
the tumor and normal renal tissue samples. With the help
of a semiautomatic system (Beecher Instruments, Silver
Spring, MD), two cyclindrical core tissue specimens
were punched from these regions and arrayed into a
recipient paraffin block. 19 tissue arrays were generated,
each containing 200 core tissue samples, according to 50
patients per array [14, 15].

Meier method was applied to calculate survival rates for
both progression-free and cancer-specific overall survival.
For multivariate analysis, the Cox proportional hazards
regression model was used. Univariate survival data were
tested for significance using the Mantel-Haenszel log rank
test. P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

Immunohistochemistry
The tissue micro array slides were dewaxed and
rehydrated using xylene and a series of graded alcohols,
followed by heat-induced antigen retrieval using a target
retrieval solution (S2031, DakoCytomation, Glostrup,
Denmark) in a pressure cooker for 10 min. Staining was
performed using an automated staining system (Techmate
500, DakoCytomation) with anti-rpS6 (S6 (5G10) Rabbit
mAb #2217, Cell Signaling, Boston, USA) and anti-p-rpS6
(S6-p240 Mouse mAbDAK-S6-240, DakoCytomation,
Glostrup, Denmark) for 90 min, and avidin-biotincomplex peroxidase technique using aminoethylcarbazole
for visualisation and hematoxylin for counterstaining.
In accordance with the manufacturers’ instructions, the
following solutions were used: ChemMate Detection Kit
(K5003, DakoCytomation, containing Dako REAL™
Link, ready-to-use biotinylated goat anti-mouse and
anti-rabbit immunoglobulins, and Dako REAL™ AEC/
H2O2 Substrate Solution), ChemMate Buffer Kit (K5006,
DakoCytomation), and for reduction of non-specific
avidin/biotin-related staining Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit
(SP-2001, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, U.S.A.).
As a negative control for the immunohistochemical
staining procedure, the primary antibody was omitted
or an isotype control antibody (IgG1) was used, with
all other experimental conditions kept constant. For the
immunohistochemical assessment of rpS6 and p-rpS6
expression, intensity was divided into four groups: 0
= negative to very low, 1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high
expression. The arrays were independently scored by two
pathologists (MK, SMG) blinded to tissue annotations
and patient outcomes. In the few instances of discrepant
scoring, a consensus score was determined.
