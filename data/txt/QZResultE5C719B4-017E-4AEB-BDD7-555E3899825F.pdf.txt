Abstract
The RON receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia
(PanIN) and in the majority of pancreatic cancers. In pancreatic cells, RON is an important K-Ras effector
and RON ligand can enhance migration/invasion and apoptotic resistance. However, the pathobiological significance of RON overexpression in pancreatic cancers has yet to be fully established. In this study, we demonstrate that RON signaling mediates a unique transcriptional program that is conserved between cultured
cells derived from murine PanIN or human pancreatic cancer cells grown as subcutaneous tumor xenografts.
In both systems, RON signaling regulates expression of genes implicated in cancer-cell survival, including Bcl-2
and the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) and c-Jun. shRNAmediated silencing of RON in pancreatic cancer xenografts inhibited their growth, primarily by increasing
susceptibility to apoptosis and by sensitizing them to gemcitabine treatment. Escape from RON silencing
was associated with re-expression of RON and/or expression of phosphorylated forms of the related c-Met
or epidermal growth factor receptors. These findings indicate that RON signaling mediates cell survival
and in vivo resistance to gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer, and they reveal mechanisms through which pancreatic cancer cells may circumvent RON-directed therapies. Cancer Res; 70(3); 1130–40. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The median survival of pancreatic cancer patients remains
less than 1 year. The disease incidence continues to increase,
now making pancreatic cancer the fourth leading cause of
cancer death in the United States (1). The most notable clinical features of pancreatic cancer are its propensity for early
and rapid dissemination and its resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy. It is clear that a better understanding of the biological basis of these features is desperately needed.
Our laboratory and others identified the RON tyrosine kinase receptor, a c-Met family member, as an overexpressed
protein and a potential novel therapeutic target in pancreatic
cancer. This finding was recently confirmed by a comprehensive analysis of the pancreatic cancer genome (2–4). RON has
also been identified as a key effector of K-Ras signaling
in pancreatic and lung cancer cells; it also mediates cellular
migration, invasion, and apoptotic resistance in cultured
pancreatic cancer cells (2, 5). These findings have raised inAuthors' Affiliations: 1 Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical

terest in RON as a potential novel therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer. Although RON overexpression has been
shown, no mutations or major splice variants of RON have
been reported in pancreatic cancer specimens. It remains unclear whether the RON ligand increases proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells, as studies have reported conflicting
results (2, 3). Despite these unresolved questions, several
groups have reported that RON-directed therapies can reduce
the growth of human pancreatic cancer xenografts (3, 6).
In the present study, we sought to investigate the relevance of RON signaling to pancreatic carcinogenesis by first
characterizing the transcriptome of pancreatic cancer cells
exposed to the RON ligand. Our studies revealed that RON
regulates the expression of multiple genes that promote cancer cell survival, including Bcl-2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), c-jun, and c-fos. To further investigate the importance of RON signaling to pancreatic cancer cell survival,
we used shRNA technology to silence RON expression in two
pancreatic cancer cell lines, XPA-1 and FG. The proliferation
of pancreatic cancer cells was minimally affected by loss of
RON signaling, and RON-deficient cells were competent to
form tumor xenografts. We show, however, that FG-derived
RON-deficient tumors were significantly growth inhibited
and that both FG- and XPA-derived tumors showed enhanced susceptibility to spontaneous apoptosis. In addition,
XPA-1–derived RON-deficient tumors showed enhanced susceptibility to treatment with gemcitabine chemotherapy. Finally,
we show that escape from RON silencing occurs in association
with reexpression of the receptor and/or upregulation of the

receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) c-met and epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR). These studies suggest that RON signaling contributes to pancreatic cancer cell survival and therapeutic resistance in vivo, and also suggest potential
mechanisms of escape from RON-directed therapies.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and maintenance. The mouse pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) cell line was derived from
the Pdx-1Cre/LSL-KRASG12D mouse model of pancreatic cancer (as previously described in refs. 2, 7) and was maintained
in DMEM. XPA-1 cells were originally derived from a primary
human pancreatic cancer xenograft established at Johns
Hopkins (8, 9). The human BxPC3 cell line was obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection. The XPA-1-RFP and
BxPC3-RFP cell lines were constructed at AntiCancer, Inc.
and kindly provided by Dr. Michael Bouvet (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA) and were maintained in
RPMI with 1% sodium pyruvate and 1% nonessential amino
acids. The FG cell line was kindly provided by Dr. David
Cheresh (University of California, San Diego) and was maintained in DMEM high-glucose medium. All media were supplemented with 1% sodium pyruvate and 1% nonessential
amino acids with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin unless otherwise indicated. All cells were
grown in a humidified incubator at 37°C.
RON-silenced XPA-1-RFP or FG or control XPA-1-RFP cells
were created through transfection with either an shRNA plasmid directed against RON (RHS1764; Open Biosystems; target
sequence 5′-CGCGTAGATGGTGAATGTCATA-3′) or a control
plasmid (RHS 1703; Open Biosystems) using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Stable
clones were isolated, expanded, and characterized following
selection in 2.5 μg/mL puromycin for 5 to 10 d for the XPA1-RFP clones, and 1 μg/mL for 21 d for the FG clones. To label
the RON-silenced FG cells with mCherry, a pCDH-MCS vector
(System Biosciences) containing the mCherry gene at the
Nhe1-BamH1 sites was reverse transfected into the cells
using Lipofectamine 2000. Following transfection, fluorescence-activated cell sorting was performed, and cells were
expanded and maintained in 5 μg/mL puromycin.
Gene-chip studies. To identify genes whose expression was
altered in murine PanIN cells by the RON ligand HGFL (hepatocyte growth factor-like protein), total RNAs were isolated
from three independent samples of PanIN cells. At 60% to
80% confluency, PanIN cells were washed thrice and then divided into three treatment groups: (a) 10% serum medium,
(b) 400 ng/mL of the RON-specific ligand HGFL (recombinant
human MSP; R&D Systems) in 10% serum medium for 30 min,
or (c) 400 ng/mL of HGFL in 10% serum medium for 12 h. Cells
were then washed thrice and trypsinized. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen). Total RNA was purified using
RNeasy columns (Qiagen) and quality was assessed using an
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). The
Affymetrix standard protocol with oligo dT primers was used
to label whole RNAs. Biotinylated cRNA was purified with

www.aacrjournals.org

RNeasy columns and hybridized to Affymetrix MOE430plus2
microarrays using standard procedures (10). The 430 v.2.0 array contains 45,000 probe sets representing more than 34,000
mouse transcripts.
Bioinformatic analyses. CEL files were generated from
GCOS 5.0 and subjected to Robust Multichip Average
(RMA) normalization as implemented in GeneSpring 7.1.
Probe sets were filtered for those whose expression exceeded
RMA intensity value units greater than 6.0 in at least two replicates per condition, and for those whose expression differed between treatments on average by more than 2-fold,
with a Student's t test false discovery rate of not more than
5%. This yielded a list of 858 probe sets that were referenced
to the corresponding control values and subjected to hierarchical clustering using Pearson correlation. Clusters were
evaluated for gene cofunctional relationships using the Gene
Set Enrichment Analysis algorithm as implemented by the
Toppgene server (11).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. For quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR, total RNA was purified as described above. Five hundred to 1,000 ng of RNA were converted to cDNA using random hexamers and SuperScript
III (Invitrogen). Amplification was carried out with an ABI
7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR
green. The reference gene was β-glucuronidase. Whenever
possible, primers were designed to span an intronic sequence
and were validated by PCR and gel analysis. Primer sequences for human c-jun (forward 5′-TCGACATGGAGTCCCAGGA-3′ and reverse 5′-GGCGATTCTCTCCAGCTTCC-3′),
c-fos (forward 5′-CGGGCTTCAACGCAGACTA-3′ and reverse
5′-GGTCCGTGCAGAAGTCCTG-3′), and RON (forward 5′GAGGTCAAGGATGTGCTGATTC-3′ and reverse 5′-GAATACATAGACCAGGCCCAGAATCG-3′) were designed to span an
intronic sequence and were validated by PCR and gel analysis.
Mice and in vivo tumor studies. Five- to 8-wk-old athymic nude mice (National Cancer Institute-Frederick) were
housed in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals, and the study was approved by
the University of Cincinnati and University of California San
Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Tumor
xenografts were developed from each of the three XPA-1-RFP
and two FG-mCherry cell lines [untransfected parental cell
line, vector control, and RON-silenced cell line (XPA-1 only)].
Two hundred microliters of RPMI for the XPA-1-RFP and
200 μL of DMEM for the FG-mCherry with 5 × 106 cells were
injected s.c. into the flanks of nude mice using a 25-gauge
needle. Tumor volume was measured with calipers twice
weekly using the formula (length × width2)/2. Mice were
anesthetized and photon emission was measured from the
tumors twice weekly using a live-animal fluorescence imager
(IVIS Lumina Imaging System, Caliper, housed at UCSD) for
the XPA-1-RFP mice and an OV100 (Olympus, housed at AntiCancer, Inc.) for the FG-mCherry mice. For tumor growth
studies, 16 tumor xenografts were developed for each group
using bilateral flank injections in eight mice. Mice were euthanized and tumors were harvested 30 d after implantation. For bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) studies, mice underwent
i.p. injection of 150 μg/g BrdUrd (XPA-RFP Sigma-Aldrich,

FG-mCherry, BD Biosciences) 2 h before sacrifice. For CD31
and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) studies, tumors were harvested
as they became reliably palpable. For therapeutic studies using XPA-1-RFP cells, a total of 10 tumor xenografts were established in 10 mice using right-sided flank injections. When
the tumor volume reached 125 mm3, animals were randomly
assigned to one of the two treatment groups: (a) control animals that received no additional treatment or (b) gemcitabine-treated animals that received 65 μg/g of drug by i.p.
injection twice weekly. For mice receiving FG-mCherry cells,
a total of 12 xenografts were established in six animals. They
were divided into two groups, RON-silenced and parental,
with both getting PBS injections twice weekly using the same
volume as the XPA-RFP mice treated with gemcitabine. Mice
in therapeutic studies were euthanized and tumors were harvested when the tumor volume reached 2,000 mm3. Three
XPA-RFP mice with RON-silenced tumor xenografts were euthanized and sacrificed when treatment with gemcitabine
had reduced the tumor size to <40 mm 3 . RON-silenced
FG-mCherry mice whose tumor xenografts had not grown
beyond 400 mm3 after 8 wk were euthanized at that time.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. XPA-1-RFP xenograft tumors from nontherapeutic studies were harvested
and immediately fixed in 10% formalin, were paraffin embedded, and cut into 5-μm sections. The FG-mCherry xenograft
tumors were harvested and immediately embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound and cut into 10-μm sections. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated
through a graded series of ethanol/water solutions. Samples
were stained for H&E. A BrdUrd detection kit (Invitrogen)
and a CD31 antibody (BD Pharmingen) were used for immunohistochemistry per the manufacturer's instructions. A
TUNEL assay (Chemicon International) was performed per
the manufacturer's instructions, and samples were counterstained with hematoxylin. All slides from the XPA-1-RFP xenograft tumors were prepared by the University of Cincinnati
Mouse Histology Core and returned to the investigators who
were blinded so that scoring was performed in an unbiased
manner. Percent necrosis was determined by calculating the
percentage of necrotic area relative to the total tumor area.
BrdUrd incorporation was scored by counting the number
of cells staining positive for BrdUrd on a ×200 high-powered
field; BrdUrd-positive cells were counted in four viable random fields for each tumor specimen. For CD31 counts, three
areas of peripheral tumor, devoid of necrosis and showing the
highest vascularity, were identified by evaluating histologic
sections at ×100 magnification. Vessels were then counted
at ×200 magnification. For TUNEL scores, the Axiovision Release 4.5 software was used on the XPA-1-RFP tumors, whereas the Metamorph software was used on the FG-mCherry
tumors to capture and evaluate images at ×200 magnification.
The entire viable area of each tumor was measured using the
Axiovision or Metamorph software, respectively. TUNEL score
was calculated based on the number of TUNEL-stained cell
per measured area (μm2) of viable tumor.
Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and ELISA. Tumors were snap frozen before processing. They were placed

1132

on dry ice and were homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA) containing complete protease inhibitors and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied
Science). The lysates were left on ice for 30 min followed by
centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and then supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was determined
using the Micro BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Immunobloting was performed using between 2.5 and 30 μg of lysate.
Blots were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitations, 500 μg of tumor lysates were incubated with 1 μg of
RON C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min on ice followed by the addition of Protein A/G UltraLink Resin (Pierce)
for 1 h at 4°C with rotation. The beads were washed two
quick times followed by two 15-min washes in RIPA buffer
at 4°C with rotation. After the removal of the final wash,
the beads were resuspended in 1× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 1× NuPAGE sample reducing agent
(Invitrogen) and were incubated at 60°C for 30 min to elute
the protein from the beads. Samples were analyzed by SDSPAGE and immunoblotting. Antibodies against c-met (25H2),
phospho-met (3D7-Tyr1234/1235), Stat3 (4904), Bcl-2 (2870),
p-AKT (9271), AKT (9272), p-ERK (9101), and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK; 9102) were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology, Inc. Antibody against c-jun (610326)
was purchased from BD Biosciences. Actin antibody was
purchased from Sigma. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal
antibody (mAb) 4G10, anti-EGFR, and anti-phospho-EGFR
(9H2-Tyr1173) were purchased from Millipore. Goat antimouse–horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Chemicon/Millipore,
Inc.) and goat anti-rabbit-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
were used as secondary antibodies at 1:5,000 dilution. The
reaction was developed with Enhanced Chemiluminescence
Plus reagent (GE Healthcare).
To quantify tumor VEGF expression, 200 μg of protein for
each sample were diluted to a total volume of 100 μL with
RIPA buffer and were analyzed with a Quantikine human
VEGF immunoassay per the manufacturer's instructions
(R&D Systems).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed
using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software).
One-way ANOVA or two-tailed Student's t tests were performed as appropriate. For all analyses, P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
RON signaling in murine PanIN cells results in largescale alteration of gene expression patterning. Studies in
numerous epithelial tumor types indicate that the activated
RON receptor mediates oncogenic signaling pathways, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), β-catenin, and others
(12–14). Despite this, surprisingly little is known about what
alterations in the transcriptome are mediated by RON signaling. Based on our prior studies suggesting the importance of
RON in regulating pancreatic cancer cell invasion, migration,
and survival, we hypothesized that RON signaling would exert potent effects on the transcriptome. Initially, we were

particularly interested in the effects of RON signaling early in
pancreatic carcinogenesis. To evaluate this, we characterized
the transcriptome of cells derived from murine PanIN after
exposure to the RON ligand. PanIN cells were exposed to the
RON-specific ligand HGFL for 30 minutes or 12 hours, and
transcriptome alterations were evaluated on Affymetrix GeneChips. More than 800 differentially expressed genes were
identified that followed a variety of different patterns
(Fig. 1). As has been seen for the met receptor, a dichotomous pattern of gene expression appeared (15). After
30 min, early-response genes such as egr1, egr3, and crp61
were upregulated. At 12 hours, the transcripts of numerous
genes implicated in oncogenesis were differentially expressed. This included upregulation (3- to 10-fold) of numerous transcription factors, including c-jun, c-fos, and atf-3 of
the activator protein (AP-1) transcription factor complex
STAT3; as well as genes regulating cell survival, such as Bcl-2;
and genes regulating angiogenesis, such as VEGF-A. Gene-chip
findings were validated using Western blot and quantitative
PCR. These data suggest that through its effects on transcription, RON signaling mediates a wide array of onco-

genic pathways in cells derived from pancreatic cancer
precursors.
RON signaling regulates pancreatic cancer cell survival
in vivo. In previous work, we found that RON signaling activates the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways and
promotes apoptotic resistance in pancreatic cancer cells, including the murine PanIN cell line (2). Given our current
findings that RON signaling regulates the expression of genes
that promote cancer cell survival in vitro, we sought to determine if RON signaling was important for the regulation of
survival pathways in vivo. For these studies, we used the human pancreatic cancer cell lines XPA-1 and FG and stably
transfected them with shRNAs specific to the RON receptor
transcript or a nonsense control. FG cells are mutant for
both KRAS and P53, whereas XPA-1 cells, which were derived
from a primary human pancreatic cancer xenograft, are wildtype for KRAS and have mutant P53. These cell lines were
chosen as they have a varied genetic background, yet each
overexpresses the RON receptor. Interestingly, we were unsuccessful in our attempt to develop RON-deficient BxPC3
cell lines, suggesting that RON may be a critical regulator

of cell survival or proliferation in this line. In contrast, RONdeficient XPA-1 and FG cells were viable. Immunoblot analysis showed that RON expression was reduced by >95% in
shRON-XPA-1 cells relative to controls and ∼80% in FG cells
(data not shown). Both shRON-XPA-1 and shRON-FG cells
were competent to develop subcutaneous tumor xenografts.
For all animal studies, we used XPA-1 cells transduced with
an RFP-expressing retrovirus and FG cells transduced with
mCherry to allow for noninvasive imaging. We developed
tumor xenografts by injecting 5 × 10 6 RON-silenced or
RON-expressing cells into the subcutaneous flank of nude
mice. After documenting decreased RON protein expression
in our xenografts (Fig. 2A), we next examined their growth
characteristics. RON-deficient FG cells immediately showed
growth inhibition compared with controls (Fig. 2B). RONdeficient XPA-1 tumors initially appeared to grow at a similar
rate to the controls. Although it was slightly reduced in RONdeficient FG cells, BrdUrd incorporation was not statistically
different in RON-deficient cells versus parental cells in either
XPA-1 or FG (Fig. 2C and D, respectively). When tumors were
excised, we noted significantly more necrosis in RON-deficient tumors, particularly in the XPA-1–derived subset. We
quantified necrosis after H&E staining and observed an
85% increase in the area of necrosis within RON-deficient
tumors compared with controls (P = 0.001; Fig. 3A). Evaluation of photon emission from RON-deficient FG and XPA-1
xenografts showed a 3-fold relative decrease (P = 0.002) in
emission from RON-silenced tumors compared with RONexpressing controls, suggesting that a significantly less viable
tumor was present within the RON-deficient tumors (Fig. 3B).

These data are consistent with earlier in vitro findings that alterations in RON signaling had no effect on the proliferation of
RON-expressing pancreatic cancer cell lines (2). Together,
these data show that although RON signaling may not significantly influence the proliferation of the pancreatic xenografts, it may be essential for cell survival within the tumors
themselves.
Microvessel density is enhanced in RON-deficient pancreatic cancer xenografts. The pathologic finding of tumor
necrosis may be attributed to rapid tumor growth that
exceeds the capacity of tumor blood supply (i.e., a failure
of angiogenesis) or an increased susceptibility to cell death.
Effective antiangiogenic therapies may result in increased
tumor necrosis and the associated decrease in tumor microvessel counts (16, 17). Our gene-chip studies showed an
upregulation in the transcription of VEGF-A after RON
activation. Therefore, we hypothesized that the increased necrosis seen in RON-silenced tumor xenografts may be attributable to a failure of angiogenesis secondary to the loss of
tumor-derived VEGF. We therefore examined VEGF production and tumor microvessel counts in pancreatic cancer
xenografts derived from RON-silenced and control cells.
Tumors were excised and analyzed soon after becoming
readily palpable. VEGF ELISA performed on tumor lysates revealed no difference in VEGF levels in RON-silenced tumors
relative to RON-expressing controls (data not shown). Curiously, CD31 staining performed on nonnecrotic areas of the
tumor revealed that microvessel density was increased by
75% in shRON-FG tumors, and by 31% in shRON-XPA tumors
(data not shown). These data suggest that the effects of RON

signaling on neovascularization are complex but that inhibition of angiogenesis is not likely to be the primary cause for
the decreased growth and necrosis observed in RON-silenced
tumors.
Ron silencing results in increased susceptibility to apoptosis in pancreatic cancer xenografts. Given these findings, we hypothesized that the diminished growth and
necrosis observed in RON-deficient tumors may be attributable to increased susceptibility to apoptosis (secondary necrosis). Our earlier in vitro studies showed that RON may play a
role in apoptotic resistance (2). To investigate the possibility
that a differential rate of apoptosis was occurring in the
absence of RON, we performed a TUNEL assay on shRONXPA-1, shRON-FG, and control tumor tissues. When examining
only the cellular areas of the tumors, we noted a 43% and 74%
increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the RON-silenced
XPA-1– and FG-derived tumors, respectively, relative to RONexpressing controls (P < 0.05 for each; Fig. 4A). This finding sug-

gests that an increase in apoptosis was primarily responsible
for the decreased growth seen in RON-silenced tumors.
To explore the molecular pathways responsible for the
reduced cell survival in RON-silenced tumors, we used our
PanIN cell microarray data as a basis to examine potential
RON-mediated regulators of apoptosis (Fig. 1). Proteins
involved in the regulation of apoptosis include bcl-2, c-jun,
c-fos, and STAT3 (18–20). Each of these was significantly
upregulated on the microarray after RON activation in PanIN
cells. C-jun and STAT3 have been identified as potential
downstream targets of RON activation in tumor types other
than pancreatic cancer (12). Bcl-2, a potent prosurvival regulator of apoptosis, has not been previously identified as a target of RON signaling, although its role in pancreatic cancer has
been described (19, 20). Additionally, PI3K and MAPK are wellknown signaling pathways activated by RON in many cancers,
including mouse PanIN and human pancreatic cancer cells
(2, 3). Immunoblots revealed decreases in the expression of

Figure 4. The effect of RON expression on apoptosis in
pancreatic tumor xenografts. A, as measured by TUNEL
staining, downregulation of the RON receptor resulted
in XPA-1 and FG tumors with 43% and 74% more apoptotic
cells per μm2 relative to RON-expressing tumors,
respectively (P = 0.05). B, tumor lysates from RON-silenced
and RON-expressing xenografts were immunoblotted for
expression levels of RON, p-ERK, total ERK, p-AKT, total
AKT, bcl-2, c-jun, and STAT3. U, tumors derived from
untransfected parental cells; N, nonsilenced transfected;
S, RON-silenced transfected. For XPA-derived tumors,
expression in RON-silenced xenografts was reduced for
p-ERK, pAKT, bcl-2, c-jun, and STAT3 by 50%, 66%, 70%,
53%, and 40%, respectively, whereas for FG tumors, levels
of p-ERK, pAKT, and STAT3 were reduced by 62%, 58%,

p-ERK, p-AKT, c-Jun, STAT3, and bcl-2, corresponding to a
decrease in RON expression in RON-deficient XPA-1–derived
tumors (Fig. 4B). In RON-deficient FG-derived tumors, we
again observed marked decreases in p-ERK, pAKT, and STAT3
expression. Bcl-2 expression was minimally changed and c-jun
expression was actually greater. These data indicate that several powerful mediators of apoptosis are downstream targets
of RON in pancreatic cancer and that the transcriptional
program regulated by RON is highly conserved between the
murine PanIN cell line and invasive human pancreatic cancer
xenografts.
RON silencing enhances the effects of gemcitabine treatment in pancreatic xenografts. Prior work by our group
showed that inhibiting RON receptor signaling sensitizes
pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine in vitro (2). Given
the new findings that RON signaling seems to regulate prosurvival pathways in pancreatic tumor xenografts, we next
sought to evaluate the effects of RON downregulation on
the response of xenograft tumors to gemcitabine treatment.
Given that RON-deficient FG tumor xenografts failed to grow
beyond 500 mm3 even after 8 weeks, we performed the next
set of experiments with XPA-1 cells only. Tumor xenografts
were again initiated by injecting RON-expressing or RONsilenced XPA-RFP cells into the flanks of nude mice. When

the tumors reached 125 mm3, mice were treated with gemcitabine (65 μg/g, approximately half of the maximally tolerated
dose) twice weekly. Tumors were evaluated by both caliper
measurement and noninvasive fluorescence imaging. Both
RON-silenced and control tumors responded to gemcitabine
treatment; however, the response in RON-silenced tumors was
nearly complete. After 7 weeks of treatment, compared with
controls, the volume of RON-silenced tumors was reduced
by more than 12-fold (P < 0.05; Fig. 5A). However, as treatment
continued, we noted that all controls and the majority of
the RON-silenced tumors began to grow again, indicating
an acquired resistance to gemcitabine therapy. This resistance, however, was significantly delayed in the RON-silenced
group relative to the RON-expressing control group. It took
78 days for RON-silenced tumors to reach a mean volume of
1,000 mm3 compared with 41 days for RON-expressing gemcitabine-treated tumors (P < 0.05), and 15 days for RON-silenced
and RON-expressing tumors that went untreated (Fig. 5B).
These data indicate that downregulation of the RON receptor
tyrosine kinase acts to sensitize pancreatic cancer xenografts
to the effects of gemcitabine.
Kinase switching occurs following escape from RON

tumors to gemcitabine therapy. Given that cells can escape
from shRNA-mediated gene silencing, we hypothesized that
gemcitabine-resistant tumors would reexpress the RON
receptor. Immunoblots comparing tumors before and after
escape from gemcitabine treatment showed that reexpression of RON occurred in ∼50% of tumors that acquired gemcitabine resistance. It was apparent that in some tumors,
RON reexpression did not explain the acquisition of gemcitabine resistance. Given that cross-talk between RON and the
RTKs c-met and EGFR has been shown previously, and the
fact that these receptors have been implicated in pancreatic
carcinogenesis, we reasoned that upregulation of alternative
kinase signaling may be occurring and could potentially
explain the acquisition of gemcitabine resistance (21, 22).
Immunoblots for phospho-EGFR and phospho-met were
initially performed on tumors before escape. No expression
of phospho-met or phospho-EGFR was detected. In contrast,
when we examined three tumors established from RONsilenced XPA cells that had escaped gemcitabine treatment,
we found that two tumors reexpressed RON, all three expressed phospho-met, and one expressed phospho-EGFR

(Fig. 6). Because the phosphoantibodies to EGFR and met
recognize mouse antigen, we cannot completely exclude host
immune cells as the source of the phosphorylated forms of
these proteins. We believe this to be less likely, however,
given that tumor xenografts of similar age, that had not
escaped growth suppression, failed to express phosphokinases, despite a visibly similar host immune cell content.

Discussion
The RON receptor tyrosine kinase has been implicated as
an oncogene in multiple epithelial cancers (23–26). Although
only a single instance of a RON point mutation has been reported, active splice variants have been identified in colon
cancers and in several cell lines of varying histology (27–
30). In the majority of tumors, as in pancreatic cancer, the
predominant mode of RON dysregulation seems to be overexpression of the receptor protein and/or its ligand. Such
overexpression has been shown to confer a poor prognosis
in breast and bladder cancer (31, 32). Despite these findings,
few studies have directly examined the effects of RON on

known oncogenic signaling pathways in vivo, and none, to
our knowledge, have investigated the role for RON signaling
in modulating the response to traditional cytotoxic cancer
therapy.
The prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains dismal, and it
is therefore critical that new therapeutic targets for this disease be identified and validated. Several groups have now
shown that the majority of pancreatic cancers overexpress
the RON protein, yet its importance to pancreatic cancer
growth and therapeutic resistance has not been directly
shown (2–4). Importantly, RON has recently been associated
with KRAS oncogene addiction in pancreatic cancer (5). In
the present study, we have shown that RON signaling regulates the expression of numerous genes that encode proteins
that promote cancer cell growth and survival. We initially
identified this aspect of the RON-regulated transcriptome in
cells derived from murine PanIN. This is significant as our
prior studies failed to reveal any effect of RON on PanIN or
pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, thereby raising the question as to how RON might contribute to pancreatic carcinogenesis. Our studies reveal that the transcriptome induced by
RON signaling is highly conserved in pancreatic cancer cells,
as we observed concordant effects on gene/protein expression when the RON transcriptome was studied by the exogenous delivery of the ligand to cultured murine PanIN cells,
and when RON was silenced in human cancer cells and grown
as tumor xenografts in nude mice.
We have identified novel RON-regulated genes, including
Bcl-2 and members of the AP-1 transcription factor complex,
c-jun, c-fos, and ATF-3. The study of RON-silenced tumors
confirmed prior in vitro data suggesting that RON is not a
critical regulator of proliferation, but again pointed to RON
as an important regulator of apoptotic resistance. It is noteworthy, however, that the effect on cell proliferation was

1138

variable between RON-deficient FG and XPA-1 cells, suggesting additional complexities to RON-regulated phenotypes. It
is also notable that regardless of KRAS status, the loss of
RON expression resulted in a marked decrease in expression
of the activated forms of AKT and ERK1/2, suggesting that
RON is an important activator of these pathways in pancreatic cancer cells in vivo.
Although our in vitro studies revealed that RON regulates
VEGF production, our in vivo experiments suggest that, at
least in this model system, RON signaling is not a critical regulator of angiogenesis. This finding is concordant with the
findings of O'Toole and colleagues (6) who reported decreased growth in BxPC3–derived tumor xenografts treated
with a RON-specific mAb, but no effect on tumor VEGF levels. Similarly, Jin and colleagues (33) recently described a
novel met-directed antibody that reduced the growth of pancreatic cancer xenografts without any effect on tumor microvessel density.
Another important finding of the current study is that in
many instances, XPA-1–derived tumor xenografts were able
to escape the response to gemcitabine therapy. This mimics
the clinical behavior of pancreatic cancers in that even when
responses to gemcitabine and/or the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib
are obtained, they are generally transient. It is therefore critical that we gain a better understanding of the mechanisms by
which pancreatic cancer cells escape initially effective therapy. Stommel and colleagues (34) reported that in glioblastoma, it is often necessary to target multiple RTKs to achieve
complete and sustained responses to RTK-directed therapy.
We similarly hypothesized that escape from RON silencing
was likely occurring through reactivation of RTK signaling,
and this possibility is supported by our findings. In each of
the RON-silenced tumors that had acquired resistance to gemcitabine, this was accompanied by reexpression of RON and/
or activation of EGFR or c-met. We did not examine the entire
kinome and obviously cannot rule out the activation of other
kinases as well. Although these data do not directly prove RTK
switching as the mechanism of resistance, it is highly likely
given the lack of any such finding in tumors that remained
growth suppressed. In addition, our findings are consistent
with those of Shah and colleagues (35) who found that resistance to increasing doses of gemcitabine was accompanied by
overexpression of phospho-met. We also cannot rule out the
development of additional genetic mutations that underlie
drug resistance in this model; however, this seems less likely
given the kinetics and uniformity with which tumor escape
occurred.
To directly test the hypothesis that kinase switching is underlying the escape from gemcitabine, we plan to pursue additional experiments to interrogate the targeted retreatment
of tumors following escape from RON silencing. With the recent development of small-molecule inhibitors directed at
RON and met, it will be of great importance to understand
the molecular circuitry of tumors so that rational combination therapies can be designed.
Traditional evaluations of cancer therapies have relied on
their ability to disrupt proliferation and induce objective tumor regression. Our study used cell lines that clearly do not

require RON receptor signaling for proliferation, yet the interruption of this pathway seems to be highly relevant to
cancer cell survival, particularly in the setting of chemotherapy
treatment. Currently, there are no biomarkers for tumors that
are dependent on RON/met signaling for proliferation and/or
survival. Given that proliferation alone does not seem to be
an adequate marker for the potential utility of RON-directed
therapy, clearly this is an area that demands investigation.
In summary, our studies reveal that RON receptor signaling mediates the viability of pancreatic cancer xenografts and
that decreased RON signaling sensitizes cells to the effects
of gemcitabine therapy. These effects seem to be mediated
by the role of RON in promoting cell survival rather than
through the effects on angiogenesis. Regardless of the KRAS
status, RON signaling remains a potent regulator of both
MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling in vivo. RON also regulates
the transcription of numerous genes involved in apoptotic
resistance, such as Bcl-2 and STAT-3. Finally, we show that
pancreatic cancers can escape from RON silencing and gem-

citabine therapy, suggesting mechanisms by which pancreatic cancer cells may circumvent RON-directed therapies.
These findings suggest that further investigations into
RON-directed therapies for pancreatic cancer are warranted
and that RON-targeted agents may ultimately form part of an
effective multidrug approach to pancreatic cancer treatment.
