Abstract
The innate cellular and molecular components required to mediate effective vaccination against weak tumorassociated antigens remain unclear. In this study, we used polymeric cancer vaccines incorporating different
classes of adjuvants to induce tumor protection, to identify dendritic cell (DC) subsets and cytokines critical to
this efﬁcacy. Three-dimensional, porous polymer matrices loaded with tumor lysates and presenting distinct
combinations of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and various Toll-like receptor
(TLR) agonists affected 70% to 90% prophylactic tumor protection in B16-F10 melanoma models. In aggressive,
therapeutic B16 models, the vaccine systems incorporating GM-CSF in combination with P(I:C) or CpG-ODN
induced the complete regression of solid tumors (40 mm2), resulting in 33% long-term survival. Regression
analysis revealed that the numbers of vaccine-resident CD8(þ) DCs, plasmacytoid DCs (pDC), along with local
interleukin (IL)-12, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) concentrations correlated strongly to
vaccine efﬁcacy regardless of adjuvant type. Furthermore, vaccine studies in Batf3/ mice revealed that CD8(þ)
DCs are required to affect tumor protection, as vaccines in these mice were deﬁcient in cytotoxic T lymphocytes
priming and IL-12 induction in comparison with wild-type. These studies broadly demonstrate that threedimensional polymeric vaccines provide a potent platform for prophylactic and therapeutic protection, and can
be used as a tool to identify critical components of a desired immune response. Speciﬁcally, these results suggest
that CD8(þ) DCs, pDCs, IL-12, and G-CSF play important roles in priming effective antitumor responses with
these vaccines. Cancer Res; 74(6); 1670–81. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The generation of immunity requires collaboration between
dendritic cells (DC) and T cells, as the priming of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTL) by DCs is a crucial event in the ﬁght against
infection and tumors (1). DCs regulate immune responses by
recognizing, processing, and decoding pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMP) and antigenic molecules (2–6).
Pamp recognition by intercellular or surface receptors on DCs
signals the presence of infection and triggers signal transduction pathways, ultimately resulting in DC activation (4–6).
Generally, activated DCs are characterized by enhanced

expression of MHC, costimulatory molecules, and proinﬂammatory cytokines, which enable DCs to translate pathogenic
signals to na€ve T cells and trigger adaptive immune responses
(2–8). Recent studies have demonstrated that DCs may act as
a network of distinct subsets, each performing specialized
functions to stimulate and polarize T-cell responses to coordinate immune regulation (9–15). Antigen processing and
presentation to T cells is predominantly attributed to the
conventional DC subset (cDC), consisting of both CD8() DCs
and CD8(þ) DCs. CD8(þ) DCs are especially adept at crosspresentation of exogenous antigen, interleukin (IL)-12 production and induction of CTL responses (16–20). The plasmacytoid DC (pDC) subset has the capacity to produce signiﬁcant
amounts of type I IFNs in response to microbial nucleic acids,
particularly during viral infection, to facilitate T-cell activation,
growth, and survival for disease clearance (13–15, 21). Moreover, the processes mediated by pDC and CD8(þ) DC subsets
have been associated with priming Th1 effector cells for the
control of infection and tumors. A balanced distribution of
activated DC subsets is associated with the control of autoimmune disease and tumors, indicating that these cells may
cooperate during the generation of protective immunity (9,
10, 12, 13).
Currently, cancer vaccines are designed to introduce antigen
in combination with adjuvants to activate DCs either ex vivo

Identify Factors Regulating Antitumor Immunity by Vaccines

before administration or in situ (7, 8, 21–24). A range of stimuli
are used to trigger innate immunity resulting from DC maturation, including proinﬂammatory cytokines, PAMPs recognized by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, and feedback
signals from innate and adaptive immune cells. Discrete
combinations of these stimuli and DC subsets may differentially control T-cell activation and polarization, and these
components may be optimized and exploited to generate
effective immune responses that eradicate tumors or infectious agents. However, it is currently unclear what components
and DC subsets should be included in cancer vaccines, partly
because current techniques limit the cell types that can be
cultured or targeted (21–24). Standard DC-based protocols
used in the clinic use monocyte-derived cDCs that are unable
to cross-present antigens, or efﬁciently produce IL-12 or type I
IFNs to prime CTL-mediated immune responses and tumor
cell death (22–24). There have been efforts to use type I
differentiated DCs in combination with TLR agonists to boost
CTL-priming capacity, but this ex vivo maturation is accompanied by decreased migratory and stimulatory function upon
implantation (22).
Previously, we described macroporous polymer matrices
that regulate the trafﬁcking and activation of DCs in vivo by
precisely controlling the presentation of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and CpG-oligonucleotide (CpG-ODN) adjuvants (25, 26). When applied as cancer
vaccines, these matrices led to CTL-mediated eradication of
melanoma tumors (26). Here, these matrices were modiﬁed to
present three different classes of TLR agonists, CpG-ODN,
monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [P(I:C)], all in combination with GM-CSF. We
hypothesized that poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) matrices presenting various combinations of adjuvants would modulate the distribution of DC subsets at the vaccine site, and
inﬂuence the development of immunity to antigens loaded
within these vaccine systems. This approach would then allow
us to identify critical cellular and molecular hallmarks for
effective vaccination or immunotherapy. Therefore, we ﬁrst
quantiﬁed the ability of various adjuvants to generate activated
DC subsets and cytokines in vivo. The impact of DC induction
on T cell–mediated immunity and cancer vaccine efﬁcacy with
models of B16-F10 melanoma was next assessed. These studies
demonstrated that antitumor efﬁcacy requires CD8(þ) DCs
and is strongly correlated with pDC numbers. Survival outcomes were also correlated to an array of inﬂammatory
cytokines, which revealed a strong relationship between IL12 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) production and antitumor efﬁcacy. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that one can recruit and use various DC subsets for in situ
vaccination, and provide important cellular and molecular
insights into cancer vaccine design.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
B16-F10 melanoma cells were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (catalog: ATCC CRL-6475) in 2010 and 2012.
Upon receipt, the cells were cultured to passage three, ali-

quoted, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For tumor experiments,
B16-F10 cells were thawed and cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.), containing
10% FBS (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100
mg/mL streptomycin. The cells were maintained at 37 C in a
humidiﬁed 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere and early-passage cells
(between 4 and 9) were used for experiments. The cells have not
been reauthenticated since receipt.
Mice
C57BL/6 mice (6–8-week-old female; The Jackson Laboratory), B6.129S2-Cd8atm1Mak/J (CD8 T cell knockout; 6–8week-old female; The Jackson Laboratory), B6.129P2(SJL)Myd88tm1.1Defr/J (MyD88 knockout; 6–8-week-old female;
The Jackson Laboratory), C57BL/6J-Ticam1Lps2/J (TRIF
knockout; 6–8-week-old female; The Jackson Laboratory), and
Batf3/ knockout mice (B6.129S(C)-Batf3tm1.1Kmm/J; 6–8week-old female; The Jackson Laboratory) were cared for in
accordance with the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International regulations.
B6.129S(C)-Batf3tm1.1Kmm/J and B6.129S2-Cd8atm1Mak/J
congenic mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice for at
least 11 and 13 generations, respectively. Experiments were all
approved by the Harvard University Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.
Matrix fabrication
A 85:15, 120-kD copolymer of PLG (Alkermes) was used in a
gas-foaming process to form porous PLG matrices (27). In brief,
PLG microspheres encapsulating GM-CSF were ﬁrst made
using standard double emulsion (28). The double emulsion
process was also used to fabricate PLG microspheres containing MPLA (Avanti Polar Lipids) as an adjuvant (29). PLG
microspheres were then mixed with 150 mg of the porogen,
sucrose (sieved to a particle size between 250 and 425 mm), and
compression molded. The resulting disc was allowed to equilibrate within a high-pressure CO2 environment, and a rapid
reduction in pressure causes the polymer particles to expand
and fuse into an interconnected structure (27). The sucrose
was leached from the scaffolds by immersion in water, yielding
scaffolds that were 80% to 90% porous.
To incorporate tumor lysates into PLG scaffolds, biopsies of
B16-F10 tumors that had grown subcutaneously in the backs of
C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were digested in
collagenase (250 U/mL; Worthington) and suspended at a
concentration equivalent to 107 cells/mL after ﬁltration
through 40-mm cell strainers. The tumor cell suspension was
subjected to four cycles of rapid freeze in liquid nitrogen and
thawed (37 C) and then centrifuged at 400 rpm for 10 minutes.
The supernatant (1 mL) containing tumor lysates was collected, incubated with the PLG microspheres, and lyophilized. The
resulting mixture was used to make PLG scaffold-based cancer
vaccines.
To incorporate CpG-ODNs and P(I:C) into PLG scaffolds,
CpG-ODN 1826, 50 -tcc atg acg ttc ctg acg tt-30 (Invivogen) or
P(I:C) (high molecular weight; Invivogen) was ﬁrst condensed

a PEI solution, while vortexing the mixture (30). The charge
ratio between PEI and CpG-ODN (NH3þ:PO4) was kept constant at 7 during condensation. The charge ratio between PEI
and P(I:C) (NH3þ:PO4) was kept constant at 3 during condensation. The condensate solutions were then vortexed with
60 mL of 50% (w/v) sucrose solution, lyophilized, and mixed
with dry sucrose to a ﬁnal weight of 150 mg. The sucrose
containing PEI-CpG-ODN condensate was then mixed with
blank, GM-CSF, and/or tumor lysate–loaded PLG microspheres to make PLG cancer vaccines.
In vitro release studies
To determine the efﬁciency of GM-CSF incorporation and
the kinetics of GM-CSF release from PLG scaffolds, 125I-labeled
hr-GM-CSF (PerkinElmer) was used as a tracer. Scaffolds were
prepared with iodinated GM-CSF and placed in 3 mL of PBS in
an incubator (37 C). At various time points, the PBS release
media was collected and replaced with fresh media. The
amount of 125I-hr-GM-CSF released from the scaffolds was
determined at each time point by counting the radioactivity of
the removed media in a gamma counter and normalizing the
result to the total 125I-GM-CSF incorporated into the scaffolds.
The total amount of CpG-ODN incorporated into PLG scaffolds
and released into PBS over time was determine by using an
oligreen assay (Invitrogen).
In addition, the MPLA incorporation and release was determined by dissolving the matrix in a 2:1 chloroform:methanol
mixture. The solution was vigorously shaken for 10 minutes
and evaporated under a stream of N2. One milliliter of 3 N
methanolic HCl, 1 mL of hexane, and 25 mL of a 10 mg/mL
pentadecanoic acid internal standard stock solution were
added to each reaction vessel. The vessels were capped tightly
and heated at 50 C for 3 hours. The samples were allowed to
cool for 10 minutes and then 1 mL each of water and hexane
was added. The reaction vessels were vigorously shaken for 5
minutes and allowed to phase separate. One microliter of the
hexane layer was sampled for the gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry analysis. The MPLA content was then quantiﬁed
by detecting the total methyl ester derivative of myristic acid.
In situ identiﬁcation of DCs and T cells
GM-CSF–loaded PLG matrices and matrices containing GMCSF in combination with either 100 mg of CpG-ODN, MPLA, or
P(I:C) were implanted into subcutaneous pockets on the back of
7- to 9-week-old male C57BL/6J mice. To analyze the DC
recruitment, scaffolds were excised at various time points and
the in-grown tissue was digested into the single-cell suspensions using a collagenase solution (Worthington; 250 U/mL)
that was agitated at 37 C for 45 minutes. The cell suspensions
were then poured through a 40-mm cell strainer to isolate cells
from scaffold particles and the cells were pelleted and washed
with cold PBS and counted using a Z2 coulter counter (Beckman Coulter). To assess DC inﬁltration and activation, subsets
of the total cell population isolated from PLG matrices
were then stained with primary antibodies (BD Pharmingen)
conjugated to ﬂuorescent markers to allow for analysis by
ﬂow cytometry. Allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated CD11c (DC
marker), ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated MHCII,

1672

and phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated CD86 (B7, costimulatory
molecule) stains were conducted for DC recruitment and
activation analysis. To further delineate the presence of speciﬁc
DC subsets, cells were also stained with APC-conjugated CD11c
and PE-conjugated PDCA-1 (pDC marker) or APC-conjugated
CD11c and PE-conjugated CD8 (CD8 DCs). The DC subsets were
classiﬁed as CD8(þ)CD11c(þ) DCs (CD8þ DCs) and CD11c(þ)
CD8()PDCA-1(þ) (pDCs). To track the DC emigration from
the implant site, FITC was incorporated into the scaffolds
(25, 31). To assess T-cell inﬁltration, PE-Cy7-conjugated CD3
stains were performed in conjunction with APC-conjugated
CD8a (CD8 T cells) and PE-conjugated FoxP3 [regulatory T cell
(Treg)] and analyzed with ﬂow cytometry. Cells were gated
according to single-positive FITC, APC, and PE stainings and
using isotype controls. The percentage of cells staining positive
for each surface antigen was recorded.
Tumor growth assays, protective cytokines, and Trp2
pentamer analysis
PLG scaffolds with melanoma tumor lysates and GM-CSF in
combination with CpG-ODN, MPLA, or P(I:C) were implanted
subcutaneously into the lower left ﬂank of C57BL/6J mice. For
prophylactic vaccinations, animals were challenged 14 days
later with a subcutaneous injection of 105 B16-F10 melanoma
cells (ATCC) in the back of the neck. Animals were monitored
for the onset of tumor growth (1 mm3) and sacriﬁced for
humane reasons when tumors grew to 20 to 25 mm (longest
diameter).
To assess the PLG vaccine efﬁcacy in the therapeutic setting,
C57/BL6J mice were challenged with a subcutaneous injection of
5  105 B16-F10 melanoma cells (ATCC) in the back of the neck.
At day 9 after tumor challenge, PLG vaccines loaded with 3,000
ng GM-CSF in combination with 100 mg of CpG-ODN, MPLA, or
P(I:C), and tumor lysates were implanted subcutaneously into
the lower left ﬂank of C57BL/6J mice. A subset of mice was
vaccinated again 10 days after the initial vaccination (day 19).
To determine in vivo concentrations of inﬂammatory cytokines at the matrix implant site, adjacent tissue was excised
and digested with tissue protein extraction reagent (Pierce).
After centrifugation, the concentrations of cytokines in the
supernatant were then analyzed with ELISA (R&D systems)
and Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Cytokine 23-Plex Assay (Bio-Rad),
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Local cytokine
analysis at the vaccine site was performed in wild-type (WT)
C57BL/6J mice, Batf3/ mice, and CD8 T-cell knockout mice.
To study the generation of TRP-2-speciﬁc CTLs, single-cell
suspensions were prepared from the spleens of mice immunized with PLG vaccines [antigen þ 3,000 ng GM-CSF þ 100 mg
(CpG or MPLA or P(I:C)] at various time points. These cells
were initially stained with PE-H-2Kb/TRP2 pentamers (SigmaAldrich), and subsequently stained with FITC-anti-CD8 and
PE-CY7 CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb; BD Pharmingen)
before being analyzed using ﬂow cytometry.
TIL characterization
On the indicated days, B16-F10 tumors were removed from
mice, and digested in 1 mg/mL collagenase II (250 U/mL;
Worthington) and 0.1 mg/mL DNase for 1 hour at 37 C.

Identify Factors Regulating Antitumor Immunity by Vaccines

Dissociated cells were ﬁltered through a 40-mm ﬁlter, and
directly stained with antibodies for phenotype characterization by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.
APC-anti-CD8 and PE-Cy7-anti CD3 were used to identify T
cells isolated from the B16F10 tumors. These tumor-inﬁltrating leukocytes (TIL) were also costained with FITC-anti-IFN-g
and PE-anti-CD107a. All antibodies were obtained from
eBioscience.

Results

DCs or their precursors. GM-CSF–loaded PLG scaffolds were
also modiﬁed to present TLR-activating, CpG-ODN, MPLA, and
P(I:C) molecules, as danger signals. The in vitro release kinetics
of GM-CSF were similar in all conditions, irrespective of which
TLR agonist was included in the vaccine (Fig. 1B–D). TLR
agonists were more stably associated with scaffolds than was
GM-CSF, as only 20% to 30% of incorporated CpG-ODN, P(I:C),
and MPLA were released over the ﬁrst 10 days in vitro, followed
by slow and sustained release of danger signals over the next 14
days. Presentation of the TLR agonists in this system was
designed to provide a long-term, local signal to activate DCs.
Importantly, the relatively high molecular weight and composition of the particular PLG chosen to fabricate scaffolds results
in slow scaffold degradation (31), allowing for long-term
analysis of the vaccine site and its regulation over DC activation and T-cell immunity.

Controlled GM-CSF and TLR agonist presentation

quickly release GM-CSF (25). Approximately 60% of the protein

and 2.2-fold, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1), as compared
with GM-CSF delivery alone. Analysis of the activation state of
matrix-resident DCs revealed that local TLR induction produced signiﬁcant percentages of activated DCs, as CD11c(þ)
cells positive for MHCII(þ) and CD86(þ) comprised approximately 30%, 19%, and 28% of the total cells recruited to CpG-,
MPLA-, and P(I:C)-loaded matrices, respectively. Matrices presenting TLR agonists mediated approximately 15- (MPLA), 20[P(I:C)], to 23-fold (CpG-ODN) increases in the total number of
activated DCs at the implant site, relative to control matrices
devoid of this signaling (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Because lymph node homing of DCs is a critical factor in
generating immunity, we investigated the ability of TLR agonists to promote DC emigration from PLG matrices to the
draining lymph nodes. As used in previous reports, FITC was
incorporated into PLG scaffolds as a model antigen, as DCs
recruited to the scaffold will ingest this label (32). The label can
be later used to identify these cells following their trafﬁcking to
the inguinal lymph nodes. At day 2, MPLA stimulation led to a
signiﬁcantly higher overall number of scaffold-derived DCs in
the inguinal lymph nodes as compared with controls and
scaffolds containing CpG-ODN or P(I:C) as a stimulant (Fig.
2B). However, at later time points, day 4 and 7 after implantation, the number of DCs induced to home to lymph node by
MPLA subsided to control levels (Fig. 2B), whereas CpG-ODN
or P(I:C) stimulation resulted in a signiﬁcantly higher number
of DCs. At day 7 after implantation, CpG- and P(I:C)-loaded
matrices resulted in more than a 10-fold increase in lymph
node DCs over control conditions and MPLA stimulation (Fig.
2B), and these results were consistent with the DC activation
observed at the vaccine site (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2).
These data indicate that CpG-ODN or P(I:C) agonists, as
presented from PLG matrices, were able to promote greater
and sustained lymph node homing as compared with MPLA or
control conditions.
Interestingly, stimulation of the cells that inﬁltrated PLG
matrices with CpG-ODN, MPLA, or P(I:C) enriched the numbers
of CD11c(þ)PDCA-1(þ) pDCs and CD11c(þ)CD8(þ) cDCs (Fig.
3A) relative to controls. The danger signals increased the
numbers of pDCs at the implant site by approximately 4-fold
relative to control matrices, with an average pDC number of
140,000 cells residing in the scaffolds presenting any of the TLR
agonists (Fig. 3A). CD8(þ) DCs were also present at the implant
site at approximately 5-fold higher levels with MPLA and P(I:C)
presentation, and at a 9-fold higher number when using CpGODN as a stimulant. Strikingly, the local delivery of TLRactivating agents promoted the local production of IL-12
(200–400 ng/mL) at the implant site (Fig. 3B), with CpG and
P(I:C) inducing the highest levels. The IL-12 concentration
correlated with the increased numbers of activated DCs and

concentrations of a panel of candidate inﬂammatory cytokines
were assayed at the vaccine site (Supplementary Tables S1 and
S2 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Elevated levels of IFN-a (Supplementary Fig. S3) resulted from CpG-ODN and P(I:C) presentation, whereas MPLA had no effect on IFN-a concentration.
However, MPLA led to 4-fold higher levels of TNF-a (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S4). Interestingly,

cytokine production, the antitumor efﬁcacy of these systems
was tested in the poorly immunogenic, B16-F10 melanoma
model. B16 tumor lysates were used as a source of tumor
antigen in vaccine formulations. Prophylactic PLG-based vaccines presenting both B16-F10 tumor lysates and GM-CSF
resulted in 10% of the vaccinated mice surviving, tumor-free
(Fig. 4A), after an otherwise lethal cell challenge at day 14 after
vaccination. Importantly, antigen-loaded matrices with GMCSF in combination with TLR agonists produced signiﬁcant,
and long-term tumor protection. CpG-ODN, MPLA, and P(I:C)
presentation from PLG vaccines resulted in 90%, 80%, and 70%

IL-12 concentrations at MPLA-loaded matrices were 2-fold

TNF-a may inhibit monocyte- and DC-derived IFN-g, IL-12, and
T-cell priming (33) and the aforementioned cytokine proﬁles,
suggesting that MPLA-loaded matrices might be less efﬁcient at

strongly correlated with the numbers of pDCs, CD8(þ) DCs,
and with endogenous IL-12 and G-CSF generated by PLG
vaccines (Fig. 4A–D and Supplementary Table S2). These
ﬁndings suggest that the important parameters potentiating
vaccine efﬁcacy include cross-presentation by CD8(þ) DCs,
and cooperative mechanisms promoted by pDCs and the
cytokines, IL-12 and G-CSF.
Moreover, TLR-MyD88 and TLR-TRIF are critical signaling pathways regulating cytokine production and immune
responses (34), and a complete loss of prophylactic vaccine
efﬁcacy was observed when using vaccines in TRIF and
MyD88 knockout mice, regardless of the TLR agonist (Supplementary Fig. S5). Although P(I:C) is thought to be TRIFdependent (TLR3), CpG MyD88-dependent (TLR9), and
MPLA (TLR4) can activate via TRIF and MyD88, it is likely
that TLR agonists presented within tumor cell lysate and
polymeric formulations require both pathways to promote
the appropriate cytokine production and cellular regulation
that actuates effective vaccination.
Therapeutic vaccination and antitumor CTL activity
As speciﬁc vaccine formulations containing various TLR
agonists produced signiﬁcant numbers of activated DCs and
conferred prophylactic immunity, it was hypothesized that
these would lead to superior therapeutic responses and CTL
responses. To test this hypothesis, mice challenged with 5 
105 B16-F10 melanoma cells were subsequently vaccinated at
days 9 and 19, after tumors were established. All tumor-bearing
mice implanted with control PLG matrices demonstrated
rapid tumor growth and required euthanasia by day 24, as
expected (Fig. 5A and B). PLG vaccines presenting MPLA as an
adjuvant decreased the rate of tumor progression (Fig. 5A), and
a slight increase in mean survival time (1.5 fold increase) over
controls was found (Fig. 5A and B). Complete tumor regression
(tumors  36 mm2) and long-term survival of mice (33%
survival) was achieved in the subset of mice vaccinated with
PLG vaccines exploiting P(I:C) and CpG-ODN as an adjuvant.
To further characterize the therapeutic response, mice were
vaccinated at 9 days after tumor challenge and FACS analysis
was used to determine the induction of B16-F10 TILs. Strikingly, a one-time dose of vaccines loaded with TLR agonists
produced signiﬁcant numbers of tumor-inﬁltrating CD8(þ)
CTLs, as compared with control animals (Fig. 5C and D). CD8
(þ) T-cell inﬁltrates were further characterized for coexpression of IFN-g and CD107a, a marker for cytotoxic-associated
cell degranulation. These cell populations were markedly
enhanced in vaccine-treated animals (Fig. 5C and D). Vaccines
featuring CpG-ODN, P(I:C), and MPLA signaling resulted in
approximately 6.1-, 3.1-, and 1.4-fold increases in IFN-g(þ),
CD107a(þ) TILs in comparison with controls. Moreover, CpGloaded vaccines resulted in signiﬁcantly higher numbers of
activated TILs in comparison with their P(I:C) and MPLA
counterparts (Fig. 5D).
The activation of systemic CTL responses was also monitored by staining splenocytes with MHC class I/TRP2 peptide
pentamers to identify CTLs with speciﬁcity to tyrosinaserelated protein (TRP)-2. This is a main antigenic target of
melanoma vaccines in mice and humans. A signiﬁcant expan-

www.aacrjournals.org

sion of TRP2-speciﬁc CTLs was observed in the spleens of mice
vaccinated with CpG-ODN-, MPLA-, and P(I:C)-loaded vaccines, in comparison with controls devoid of TLR agonists (Fig.
5E). Analysis of cells inﬁltrating the vaccines incorporating
TLR agonists also revealed a signiﬁcant, local CD3(þ)CD8(þ)
T-cell response (Supplementary Fig. S6), likely in response to
sustained tumor antigen presentation.
Vaccination of transgenic mice lacking CD8(þ) T lymphocytes resulted in decreased levels of IL-12 and IFN-g (Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8), in comparison with WT. The IL-12–
IFN-g pathway is a positive feedback mechanism, with each
cytokine augmenting production of its counterpart (33, 35);
these data suggest that the immune responses induced by this
vaccine system may be ampliﬁed by cytokine-mediated crosstalk between DCs and primed CTLs.
To investigate whether the potent antitumor efﬁcacy
induced by P(I:C) and CpG could translate to other tumor
settings, we tested these systems in the Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) model. The P(I:C) and CpG agonists were used
because these agonists induced the highest survival rates in
B16 melanoma models. Similar to the results in the B16
prophylactic model, P(I:C) and CpG vaccines loaded with
LLC tumor cell lysates prophylactically promoted 80% and
70% survival (Fig. 5G). Also, in therapeutic models, mice
were challenged with 5  105 LLC cells and subsequently
vaccinated at day 7. A single vaccination with either the
P(I:C) or CpG vaccine formulations was able to attenuate the
growth rate of LLC tumors by approximately 3-fold (Fig. 5F)
and double median survival times.
Vaccine efﬁcacy is impaired in mice lacking CD8(þ) DC
Because PLG vaccines incorporating TLR agonists were
capable of generating CD8(þ) DC populations in situ, which
correlated to potent antitumor CTL responses and survival
(Figs. 4 and 5), we next examined whether these cells were
required to confer antitumor immunity in vivo. Batf3/
transgenic mice were used in these experiments, as they lack
CD8(þ) DCs, without exhibiting abnormalities in other
hematopoietic cell types or tissue architecture (20). WT and
Batf3/ mice were vaccinated with CpG-ODN–loaded PLG
vaccines and challenged with B16-F10 cells 14 days later.
Vaccination of WT mice promoted complete protection
against tumor growth and long-term survival (100% survival),
as expected, but vaccinated Batf3/ were not protected and
tumor growth rates were similar to unvaccinated, WT animals
(Fig. 6A). Moreover, vaccinated Batf3/ failed to produce the
local CTL responses observed in WT mice, and a 3-fold
decrease in TRP2-speciﬁc CTLs in these mice coincided with
higher ratios of FoxP3(þ) Tregs cells at the vaccine site in this
condition (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that a lack of CD8(þ)
DCs resulted in limited cytotoxicity and allowed regulatory
pathways mediated by Tregs to potentially extinguish the
vaccine-mediated immune response. Surprisingly, the vaccine
produced signiﬁcantly lower numbers of local pDCs and
activated DCs in Batf3/ mice (Supplementary Fig. S9) compared with WT mice, suggesting that CD8(þ) DCs play a role in
generating or maintaining these cells and this effect likely
contributed to the loss of vaccine efﬁcacy. The systemic

production of antitumor CTLs was also impaired in Batf3/,
as a 3-fold reduction in Trp2-speciﬁc CTLs was measured in
the spleens of these mice in comparison with WT controls (Fig.
6D). These results indicate that vaccine efﬁcacy in this system
is critically regulated by CD8 DCs, potentially via their ability to
cross-present tumor antigens, to produce Th1 induction factors, such as IL-12, and to generate and interact with CTLs.
Because our regression analysis identiﬁed IL-12, G-CSF, and
IL-6 as strong correlates to survival (Supplementary Table S2),
we investigated whether the presence of CD8(þ) DCs affected
induction of these cytokines by PLG vaccines. WT mice were
able to induce the production of the T-cell growth factor, IL-12,
at the vaccine site at 5-fold higher levels than found in
vaccinated Batf3/ mice (Fig. 6C). The partial loss of IL-12
production in CD8(þ) DC knockout mice suggests that these
cells are important producers or mediators of this Th1-polarizing cytokine. Similarly, knocking out the CD8(þ) DC population resulted in approximately 3-fold decreases in the levels
of IL-6 and G-CSF at the vaccine site (Supplementary Figs. S10
and S11). These cytokines are associated with priming innate
immunity and danger signal activation, including TLR signaling, suggesting that these mechanisms of DC stimulation are
compromised in Batf3/ mice.

Discussion
To address the limitations of current cancer vaccines, we
used a PLG matrix controlling the presentation of tumor lysate,

GM-CSF, and TLR agonists to create a vaccine node that
recruits and activates multiple DC subsets in situ. This tool
was used to investigate the contribution of DC subsets to
vaccine efﬁcacy and demonstrated that effective tumor cell
killing required the participation of CD8(þ) DCs, with strong
correlations to pDC number and IL-12, G-CSF, and IL-6 concentrations. This study expands on previous reports, by demonstrating that these components were critical to vaccine
efﬁcacy, regardless of the type of stimulant incorporated
within the scaffolds.
As described previously, GM-CSF delivery was used to
promote DC recruitment to the vaccine site where these cells
are subsequently activated by TLR-agonist presentation. We
determined that vaccines were able to maintain elevated levels
of GM-CSF for at least 14 days regardless of the TLR agonist
incorporated into the system. Interestingly, GM-CSF concentrations at the vaccine site at day 14 were approximately 80- to
110-fold higher than the concentrations that would be
expected solely from release from the vaccine, as determined
by in vitro release kinetics. The absolute concentrations were
also lower than control matrices with only GM-CSF (Supplementary Table S1). The assay is not able to distinguish between
exogenous and endogenous GM-CSF and cellular inﬁltrates
may differentially produce and consume GM-CSF at the vaccine site in response to local vaccine activity (Supplementary
Table S1).
In this report, we now describe methods to incorporate
different classes of TLR agonists into biomaterial vaccine

systems and control their presentation. Inclusion of TLR
stimulation was required to signiﬁcantly upregulate DC coexpression of MHCII and CD86 (Fig. 2), enhancing their capacity
to propagate antigen-speciﬁc T-cell populations. Appropriate
TLR signaling increased the generation of CD8(þ) and pDC
subsets at the vaccine site, and stimulated the production of
IFNs and the potent T-cell growth factor, IL-12. Moreover,
removal of TLR agonists from the system resulted in decreased
numbers of Trp2-speciﬁc, cytotoxic CD8(þ) T cells locally at
the vaccine site and systemically in spleens and tumors, and
this coincided with reduced survival in vaccine studies.
Interestingly, a recent report described the sequestration of
tumor-speciﬁc, CD8(þ) T cells at the site of vaccines with
persistent antigen presentation (47). In that study, this resulted
in dysfunctional immune responses and local T-cell apoptosis
relative to relatively nonpersistent vaccine formulations (36).
In contrast to those peptide-based vaccines, the system in this
report was fabricated to present whole-tumor cell lysates
within controlled inﬂammatory microenvironments to confer
an immunostimulatory and tumor-mimicking microenvironment, which produced signiﬁcant, antigen-speciﬁc T-cell inﬁltration at both the vaccine site and the tumor environment
(Figs. 5C–E and 6B; Supplementary Fig. S6). For example, after
10 days of CpG-mediated vaccination, the tumor and the PLG
vaccine site were similarly enriched with CD8(þ) T cells (5%
of total cells; >106 antigen-speciﬁc T cells in tumors), with
potent antitumor effects. A double dose of PLG vaccines
presenting P(I:C) or CpG-ODN induced potent tumor rejection
in therapeutic models of B16-F10 melanoma, causing complete
tumor regression in over a third of vaccinated animals and
eradicating tumors reaching 35 mm2 in size. The tumor sites in
vaccinated animals demonstrated intense and activated CD8
(þ), CTL inﬁltrates, as determined by CD107a and IFN-g
expression, likely affecting tumor-cell killing. Although the
PLG vaccines were able to induce prophylactic and therapeutic
survival in B16 models, unlike peptide in mineral oil formulations, the ﬁndings by Hailemichael and colleagues (36) suggest
that we could further improve efﬁcacy by using more degradable PLG formulations that may reduce the duration of antigen
presentation to focus the induced T-cell response on tumors.
These systems outperformed the preclinical, historical
results of current vaccine modalities extensively studied in
the clinic, including irradiated tumor cell vaccines and DCbased vaccines (7, 8, 26, 37, 38). Also, vaccines containing CpGODN and P(I:C) stimulation were able to confer efﬁcacious
antitumor responses in both prophylactic and therapeutic LLC
models, indicating that these results are transferable to other
tumor settings.
Interestingly, vaccines presenting MPLA signaling slowed
tumor growth rates but did not cause tumors to completely
regress. The current vaccine design is able to effectively exploit
CpG-ODN and P(I:C) signaling, as compared with MPLA, to
promote higher average levels of cell surface activation markers on DCs and cytokine proﬁles that promote Th1 polarization and CTL responses. In addition, MPLA was a strong
inducer of TNF-a, in comparison with CPG-ODN and P(I:C)
(Supplementary Fig. S2), and this may inhibit IL-12 and IFN
pathways priming CTL responses (33, 35). It is important to

www.aacrjournals.org

note that these results do not deﬁnitively address the potency
of TLR4 antagonism relative to TLR3 and TLR9. Other design
variables, such as MPLA dose, and alternative TLR4 agonists
should be tested in the future. However, the data do indicate
that the induction of activated DCs and CTL is dependent on
TLR stimulation and is consistent with survival rates.
Strikingly, all the vaccinated Batf3/ mice generated
tumors in prophylactic models, whereas 90% of WT mice were
protected and survived in the long-term. This ﬁnding expands
upon our correlative measures by proving that CD8(þ) DCs
are, in fact, a critical component of cancer vaccine efﬁcacy in
these systems. Furthermore, cytokine analysis of the vaccine
site of Batf3/ mice revealed that local IL-12 levels, and CTL
responses were markedly reduced, suggesting that CD8(þ)
DCs are an important source or mediator of local production of
IL-12 and Th1 polarization. CD8(þ) DC participation and
vaccination not only resulted in reduced cytotoxic, CD8(þ)
T-cell activity (at tumor site and spleen), it also allowed the
progression of Treg activity. High FoxP3(þ) Treg to CD8(þ) Tcell ratios indicate unbalanced immunosuppression that could
extinguish vaccine efﬁcacy and promote tumor growth (39, 40).
CD8(þ) DCs and IL-12 can cause Treg inhibition or their
conversion to IFN-g–producing, effector T cells (29, 41, 42),
and these mechanisms are potentially critical to the efﬁcacy of
these material-based cancer vaccines. Surprisingly, another
cytokine, G-CSF, was found to be a strong correlate of vaccine
efﬁcacy (Supplementary Table S2) even though it has been
associated with suppression of T-cell proliferation and cytolytic effectors (43–45). G-CSF, however, is a strong mobilizing
factor for mononuclear cells and DCs, and its elevated endogenous production may combine with vaccines presenting TLR
ligands to enhance DC differentiation and activation, and
antitumor responses (46, 47).
An interesting aspect of this vaccine system is CTL homing
to the vaccine site (Supplementary Fig. S3), likely due to longterm antigen presentation. Knocking out CD8(þ) T cells also
resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of local levels of IFN-g and
IL-12 (Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5). Others have shown that
T cell–derived IFN-g enhances DC expression of IL-12 and
costimulatory molecules, creating a feedback loop that ampliﬁes CTL-mediated responses to infection. In the current study,
after vaccine priming, T cells that home back to the antigenpresenting vaccine site may be important vaccine components
themselves, as they may sustain and amplify CTL responses via
IFN-g–mediated DC activation and IL-12 production.
These ﬁndings provide evidence that CD8(þ) DCs, pDCs,
and IL-12, or their equivalent functionally play key roles in
material-based cancer vaccines. The relation between pDC, IL12, G-CSF and vaccine efﬁcacy are currently correlative and
further studies should be undertaken to critically examine
these relationships. Finally, the methods described here may
be adapted to identify cellular and molecular components that
may be used to design immunotherapeutic applications for
other clinical indications, such as infectious and autoimmune
disease.
