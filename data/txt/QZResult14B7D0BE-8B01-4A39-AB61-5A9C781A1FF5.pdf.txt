Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSC) have garnered signiﬁcant attention as a therapeutic focus, based on evidence that
they may represent an etiologic root of treatment-resistant cells. Indeed, expression of the multidrug
resistance protein ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) confers chemoresistance to CSCs,
where it serves as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. Here, we show that afatinib, a small-molecule
inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases EGFR, HER2, and HER4, preferentially eliminated side population cells with
CSC character, in both cell lines and patient-derived leukemia cells, by decreasing ABCG2 expression. In these
cells, afatinib also acted in parallel to suppress self-renewal capacity and tumorigenicity. Combining afatinib
with the DNA-damaging drug topotecan enhanced the antitumor effect of topotecan in vitro and in vivo.
Mechanistic investigations suggested that ABCG2 suppression by afatinib did not proceed by proteolysis
through the ubiquitin-dependent proteosome, lysosome, or calpain. Instead, we found that afatinib
increased DNA methyltransferase activity, thereby leading to methylation of the ABCG2 promoter and to
a decrease in ABCG2 message level. Taken together, our results advocate the use of afatinib in combination
with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs to improve efﬁcacy by improving CSC eradication. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Cancer stem cells (CSC) are thought to be responsible
for tumor metastasis, chemoresistance, and recurrence after
therapy (1). An intriguing property of CSCs is their high
expression of ABC efﬂux transporters, especially ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), which actively
extrudes anticancer drugs and contributes to chemoresistance of CSCs. Moreover, ABCG2 is responsible for the "side
population" (SP) phenotype, which is often used for the
identiﬁcation and isolation of cancer stem-like cells (CSLC).
Furthermore, ABCG2 also plays a crucial role in stem cell
proliferation and self-renewal (2). Therefore, ABCG2 has
been proposed to be a promising biomarker for the identiﬁcation and a new therapeutic target for the eradication of

CSCs. Novel strategies targeting ABCG2, including the downregulation of ABCG2 expression and/or function, may effectively circumvent drug resistance and eliminate CSCs to
achieve better chemotherapeutic effect (3).
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are highly promising agents
for speciﬁc inhibition of cancer cell growth and metastasis. A
large number of TKIs targeting different oncogenic signaling
pathways have been developed, and are currently used in the
clinic or being tested in clinical trials. Interestingly, it has been
reported that several TKIs, such as geﬁtinib, imatinib, and
lapatinib can interact with ABCG2, thereby inhibiting its drug
transport activity and enhancing the anticancer efﬁcacy of
conventional chemotherapeutic agents (4). Importantly, various recent studies have reported favorable clinical outcome by
combining TKIs with conventional cytotoxic agents or monoclonal antibody in cancer chemotherapy (5, 6).
Afatinib (BIBW 2992) is a novel irreversible multitargeted
TKI targeting ErbB family members EGFR, HER2, and HER4 (7).
It exhibits superior anticancer activity in patients with lung
cancer that harbor the geﬁtinib/erlotinib-resistant mutant
EGFR (including T790M, exon 20 insertion, and T790M/
L858R double mutant). Afatinib is also currently in clinical
development for the treatment of other solid tumors, such as
breast, head and neck carcinomas, and gliomas (8, 9). For now,
afatinib has shown promising clinical activity and a higher
overall response rate compared with trastuzumab or lapatinib
in patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer (8). In
addition, a phase II study showed that afatinib had clinical

activity in a subset of patients with refractory and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (10). However,
the effect of afatinib alone or in combination with other
chemotherapeutic agents on drug-resistant CSCs has not been
investigated.
In this study, we found that afatinib effectively eliminated
cancer stem cell–like SP cells and inhibited their self-renewal ability in vitro and in vivo. In addition, afatinib dramatically enhanced the efﬁcacy of chemotherapeutic agents
against SP cells by decreasing the expression of ABCG2.
More importantly, we identiﬁed a unique mechanism by
which afatinib increases DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)
activity and leads to methylation of the ABCG2 promoter and
downregulation of ABCG2 mRNA. Our ﬁndings may provide
a novel strategy for overcoming chemoresistance of CSCs
and a unique way to eradicate cancer cells by afatinib and
probably other selected TKIs.

Materials and Methods
Drug
Afatinib (BIBW2992), whose molecular structure was shown
in Supplementary Fig. S1A, was purchased from Boehringer
Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. and dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide for use at indicated concentrations.
Cell lines
The following cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. S.E.
Bates (NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD): human colon carcinoma
cell line S1 and its mitoxantrone-selected ABCG2-overexpressing subline S1-MI-80 (11), human breast carcinoma cell
line MCF7 and its ﬂavopiridol-resistant, ABCG2-overexpressing subline MCF7/FLV1000 (12). The human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE2 and its high-metastatic clone
s-18 (13) were a kind gift from Prof. M.S. Zeng (Cancer
Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China). Cell
lines used in this study were thawed from early passage
stocks and were passaged for less than 6 months. Cell lines
were periodically monitored for mycoplasma by Hoechst
staining. All cell lines were cultured in DMEM or RPMI1640
medium supplemented with 10% FBS and with 1% antibiotic
solution (penicillin-streptomycin).
Patient samples
Bone marrow blood was obtained from 30 patients with new
diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after informed consent and with the
approval of the Ethics Review Committee at Sun Yat-Sen
University (Guangzhou, China). Patient characteristics are
summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
Leukemia blasts were isolated using Ficoll–Hypaque density
gradient centrifugation and cultured in RPMI1640 medium
containing 20% FBS.
Cytotoxicity assay
Cytotoxicity was determined using MTT assay as previously
described (14). The IC50 value was deﬁned as the drug concentration resulting in 50% cell death. Both the ﬁtted sigmoidal

4432

dose response curve and IC50 were calculated by use of the
Bliss method (14).
Intracellular Hoechst 33342 accumulation assay
The intracellular accumulation assay of Hoechst 33342 was
performed as described by Goodell and colleagues with some
modiﬁcations (15). In brief, cells were incubated in 6-well
plates with exposure to 1, 2, and 4 mmol/L afatinib for 24
hours. Then Hoechst 33342 dye (0.5 mg/mL) was added and
further incubated for 30 minutes. Finally, cells were washed
with ice-cold PBS three times and resuspended in PBS for ﬂow
cytometry analysis.
SP analysis and sorting
The SP sorting and analysis were performed using the
methods described by Goodell and colleagues with some modiﬁcations (15). Brieﬂy, cells were resuspended at a density of 1 
106 cells/mL in prewarmed DMEM containing 2% FBS and 10
mmol/L HEPES. Hoechst 33342 dye was added at a ﬁnal
concentration of 5 mg/mL in the presence or absence of
Fumitremorgin C (FTC, 10 mmol/L). Cells were then incubated
at 37 C for 90 minutes with intermittent shaking. At the end of
incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The
Hoechst dye was excited at 355 nm, and the ﬂuorescence
proﬁle was measured in dual wavelength analysis (blue, 402–
446 nm; red, 650–670 nm).
Sphere-forming assay
SP and non-SP (NSP) cells were sorted from CNE2-s18 cells
as described above. Sphere cell culture was preformed according to published protocol with minor modiﬁcations (16).
Brieﬂy, single-cell suspensions were plated in six-well ultralow attachment plates (Corning Inc.) at a density of 1,000 cells/
mL. Cells were maintained in serum-free DMEM/F12 containing different concentrations of afatinib. Subsphere-forming
assay was performed by harvesting the primary spheres and
replating after dilution. Subspheres were cultured in serumfree DMEM/F12 without afatinib treatment. The number and
size of tumor spheres formed were evaluated by light microscopy after 7 days.
In vivo xenograft model
In vivo experiments were done in accordance with the guidelines for the use of laboratory animals of the Sun Yat-Sen
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Athymic nude mice (BALB/c-nu/nu) of both sexes, 5- to 6week-old, were used to establish S1-MI-80 cell xenograft
model for the drug intervention experiment. The S1-MI-80
cell xenograft model was established as previously described
(17) with minor modiﬁcation. Brieﬂy, 1  106 cells were
inoculated subcutaneously into the ﬂanks of the nude mice.
The mice were randomized into four groups (10 in each
group) after the tumors reached a mean volume of about 100
mm3, and then received various treatments: (i) saline (every
3 days for 11 times, i.p.); (ii) topotecan (every 3 days for 11
times, 3 mg/kg, i.p.); (iii) afatinib (every 3 days for 11 times,
20 mg/kg, orally); and (iv) topotecan (every 3 days for 11
times, 3 mg/kg, i.p.) plus afatinib (every 3 days for 11 times,

Figure 1. Afatinib reduced the cell surface protein expression of ABCG2. A and B, CNE2-s18 and S1-MI-80 cells were treated with afatinib at 1.0, 2.0, and
4.0 mmol/L for 48 hours, or at 2.0 mmol/L for 24, 48, and 72 hours, respectively. Western blot analysis was then performed to measure the total cellular
expression of ABCG2 protein. GAPDH was used as a loading control. C, the intracellular localization of ABCG2 in S1-MI-80 cells after the treatment of
afatinib with indicated concentrations was evaluated by confocal analysis. D and E, the membrane expression of ABCG2 in sorted SP and NSP cells and their
parental CNE2-s18 cells was detected by ﬂow cytometry. F and G, sorted SP cells were treated with afatinib at the indicated concentrations for 48 hours,
after which ABCG2 surface expression was evaluated by ﬂow cytometry.

Eradication of Cancer Stem–like Cells by Afatinib

at 12 days after the initial start date. Thereafter, tumor volume
and mice body weight were measured every 2 days.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis
Real-time PCR was performed with a Bio-Rad CFX96
Real-Time System (Bio-Rad). The amount of each target
gene in a given sample was normalized to the level of
GAPDH in that sample. The ampliﬁcation products were
analyzed on 1% agarose gels. The 2DDCt method was used to
analyze the relative changes in gene expression (18). The
PCR primers used in this study are summarized in Supplementary Table S2.
DNA methylation analysis
Cells were treated with afatinib (2 mmol/L) alone, 5-AzadC (5 mmol/L) alone, or in combination for 72 hours. The
drug-containing medium was replaced every 24 hours.
After treatment, genomic DNA was extracted using the
TIANamp Genomic DNA Kit (TIANGEN) followed by bisulﬁte conversion of 2 mg of genomic DNA using the EpiTect
Bisulﬁte Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
The methylation level of ABCG2 and TP53 promoter was
detected by methylation-speciﬁc PCR (MSP). The primer
pairs for MSP were listed in Supplementary Table S1. PCR
products were electrophoresed on a 2% polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. For the analysis of methylation level of CpG
islands of ABCG2 promoter, the PCR products from MSP
were cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara) and
sequenced. DNA methylation levels were calculated as ratio
of the methylated CpG sites to all available CpG sites within
the sequence analyzed. The sequence results were analyzed
by BiQ Analyzer software.

fore, all subsequent assays were performed with afatinib at a
concentration below 4.0 mmol/L.
To verify whether afatinib downregulated cellular expression of ABCG2, we performed a Western blot analysis of
ABCG2 in whole-cell lysate collected from CNE2-s18 and S1MI-80 cells with or without afatinib treatment. The results
indicated that afatinib decreased the total cellular expression of ABCG2 in a time- and concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. 1A and B). In addition, immunoﬂuorescence
microscopic analysis also showed a concentration-dependent decrease of cell surface staining of ABCG2 in afatinibtreated S1-MI-80 cells (Fig. 1C).
It has been reported that the SP phenotype and the chemoresistance of SP cells are attributed primarily by cell surface
expression of ABC transporters (in particular, ABCG2 and
ABCB1; refs. 19, 20). To investigate whether SP cells derived
from CNE2-s18 have elevated ABC transporters expression,
we analyzed the cell surface expression of ABCG2 and ABCB1
by ﬂow cytometry. It was found that SP cells exhibited significantly higher expression of ABCG2 than NSP cells (Fig. 1D
and E). On the other hand, ABCB1 was not detected in both SP
and NSP cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). These results
indicated that ABCG2 played a more important role in the SP
phenotype in CNE2-s18 cells.
We then analyzed the cell surface expression of ABCG2
protein after treatment with a range of concentrations of
afatinib in SP cells sorted from CNE2-s18 by ﬂow cytometry.
Afatinib was found to signiﬁcantly decrease the cell surface
expression of ABCG2 in a concentration-dependent manner in
SP cells (Fig. 1F and G).

Results

Afatinib effectively decreased the proportion of SP cells
SP cells are known to be enriched in cancer stem–like cells,
which represent a population of self-renewing and drug-resistant cells driving the tumor growth. Afatinib was found to
decrease the SP fraction of CNE2-s18 cells compared with that
of the control cells in a concentration-dependent manner
(Fig. 2A and B). The proportion of SP cells was decreased from
about 18.66% to 9.51%, 3.04%, and 1.21% after a 48-hour
treatment with afatinib at the concentration of 1, 2, and 4
mmol/L, respectively. Signiﬁcant decreases in the percentage of
SP cells in response to treatment with afatinib were also
observed in the parental cell line CNE2 (Fig. 2C and D). These
results suggested that afatinib can eliminate SP cells. To
further verify that the disappearance of SP cells was caused
by the speciﬁc elimination by afatinib, SP cells were sorted out
from CNE2-s18 cells and the purity was >97% (Supplementary
Fig. S2C). We found that afatinib drastically reduced SP
fraction and cell viability in sorted SP cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2E and F and Supplementary
Fig. S2D). Treatment with up to 4 mmol/L afatinib eliminated
SP cell populations by about 67.6%.

Afatinib reduced the protein expression of ABCG2
The in vitro cytotoxicity of afatinib was ﬁrst assessed in
various cancer cell lines by the MTT assay. More than 80%
cell survival was observed in the presence of afatinib up to
4.0 mmol/L in ABCG2-overexpressing S1-MI-80, MCF7/
FLV1000, and CNE2-s18 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). There-

DNMT activity assay
Cells were treated with afatinib (2 mmol/L) and 5-Aza-dC
(5 mmol/L) for 72 hours. Drug-containing medium was
replaced every 24 hours. After the drug treatment, the cells
were harvested and the nuclear fraction was collected using
the Nuclear Extraction Kit (Sangon Biotech). DNMT activity
of nuclear extracts was assayed according to the manufacturer's protocol using the DNMT Activity Assay (ActiveMotif).
Statistical analyses
All the experiments were performed at least in triplicate.
The statistical signiﬁcance of differences was assessed using
t test or nonparametric statistics (SPSS16.0) for comparison
between groups. Values represent mean  SD. For all tests,
P < 0.05 was considered as statistically signiﬁcant.

Figure 4. Afatinib inhibited stem-like properties of SP cells. A and B, afatinib reduced the number and size of the primary spheroids formed. Sorted SP
and NSP cells were plated in single-cell suspensions at a density of 1,000 cells/mL in CSC medium and treated with various doses of afatinib for 7 days.
C and D, primary spheres were harvested and then replated after dilution to analyze the subsphere-forming ability. E, afatinib decreased the
colony-forming ability of SP cells. Sorted SP and NSP cells were seeded in soft agar and treated with indicated concentrations of afatinib for 2 weeks.
F and G, afatinib inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Parental CNE2-s18 and sorted SP and NSP cells were cultured in CSC medium with or without 4 mmol/L
afatinib treatment for 72 hours and then were transplanted into the right or left ﬂank of NOD/SCID mice, respectively. Tumor-bearing mice were
treated with afatinib by oral gavage (20 mg/kg, every 3 days for 10 times). Tumor growth was monitored every 4 days when the mice developed palpable
tumors. Mice were euthanized at day 50. Tumor volume was calculated and plotted. Error bars indicate SD. Two-tailed Student t test was used

much more spheres than the NSP cells (Fig. 4A and B). More
importantly, afatinib was found to inhibit the formation and
growth of spheres in SP cells in a concentration-dependent

the subsphere-forming ability of SP cells (Fig. 4C and D).
Afatinib at 2 mmol/L resulted in a 3.5-fold decrease in

hand, afatinib also diminished the soft agar colony-forming
ability of SP cells (Fig. 4E). These data support that afatinib
can effectively inhibit the self-renewal capacity of SP cells
in vitro.
To investigate whether the inhibition of stemness property by afatinib in SP cells could be extended to in vivo
conditions, we used the NOD/SCID mouse model to evaluate the effect of afatinib on tumorigenic potential. The
tumorigenicity of SP and NSP cells from CNE2-s18, with
or without afatinib treatment, at cell dilution ranging from
1  103 to 1  106 cells per injection was evaluated. As
expected, the SP cells displayed higher tumorigenicity
than NSP cells, thereby validating the stemness property
of sorted SP cells (Table 1). Importantly, SP cells treated
with afatinib were found to exhibit lower tumorigenic
capacity than the untreated SP cells (Table 1). While as
few as 1  103 untreated SP cells were sufﬁcient to generate
tumors, more than 1  104 SP cells were necessary to initiate
tumor formation after afatinib treatment (Table 1). The
data clearly illustrated the impairment of tumorigenicity
of SP cells by afatinib in vivo.
Besides, we also examined the effect of afatinib on the
growth of tumors. A representative tumor growth curve in
mice transplanted with 1  105 cells was shown (Fig. 4G).
Untreated SP cells were found to grow faster than the SP cells
pretreated with afatinib (Fig. 4F and G; P < 0.05). Thus, the
data indicated that afatinib can impair the tumorigenicity of
SP cells and inhibit the tumor growth in vivo.
Therefore, when used alone, afatinib was shown to effectively eliminate the SP cells and reduce their self-renewal
capability and tumorigenic properties, both in vitro and
in vivo.
Afatinib remarkably enhanced the efﬁcacy of
chemotherapeutic drugs in SP cells
As indicated above by the decrease of ABCG2 expression by
afatinib in SP cells, we hypothesize that afatinib can also
sensitize SP cells to ABCG2-substrate chemotherapeutic
agents. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, the SP cells were more
resistant to topotecan and mitoxantrone than NSP cells. After

exposure to afatinib, the IC50 values for topotecan and mitoxantrone in SP cells were signiﬁcantly reduced, indicating the
enhancement of SP cells to topotecan and mitoxantrone.
In addition, we found afatinib could increase apoptosis
(PI-negative, Annexin V-FITC–positive) induced by topotecan and mitoxantrone in SP cells (Fig. 5C and D and
Supplementary Fig. S2E and S2F).
Afatinib dramatically increased the intracellular
accumulation of Hoechst 33342
The potentiation of anticancer activity by transporter
inhibitors is usually mediated by the inhibition of transporter-mediated efﬂux, thereby leading to an increase in the
intracellular drug accumulation (22). To explore the potential mechanism by which afatinib sensitizes SP cells to
chemotherapeutic drugs, we examined the intracellular
accumulation of Hoechst 33342, known ﬂuorescent substrates of ABCG2, by ﬂow cytometry. As shown in Fig.
5E–G, in the presence of 1, 2, or 4.0 mmol/L afatinib, the
ﬂuorescence index of Hoechst 33342 in SP cells was elevated
by 1.34-, 1.49-, 1.87-fold, respectively (Fig. 5E–G). These
results suggested that afatinib, similar to a control potent
ABCG2-speciﬁc inhibitor FTC, dramatically increases the
accumulation of Hoechst 33342 in a concentration-dependent manner in SP cells (Fig. 5E and G). However, neither
afatinib nor FTC affected the intracellular levels of Hoechst
33342 in NSP cells (Fig. 5F and G).
Afatinib enhanced the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
conventional chemotherapeutic agent in vivo
On the basis of the in vitro ﬁndings, we investigated
whether afatinib can enhance the antitumor effect of topotecan in vivo. The results showed that the antitumor ability
of topotecan was signiﬁcantly enhanced when it was administrated in combination with afatinib compared with treatment with topotecan or afatinib alone in S1-MI-80 cell
xenografts in nude mice (Fig. 5H; P < 0.01). The mean

inhibition rate (IR) of the combination group calculated
using the formula described in Materials and Methods was
up to 46.32%.
CSCs are also believed to cause tumor recurrence. Therefore, we performed 12 days of drug treatment followed by
another 12 days of drug withdrawal on CNE2-s18 xenograft
model to evaluate the duration of antitumor effect of afatinib.
A better and more durable tumor growth inhibitory effect
was observed in the combination group (afatinib and topotecan) compared with afatinib or topotecan alone (Fig. 5I;
P < 0.01). Interestingly, afatinib alone also exhibited a longer
lasting antitumor effect than topotecan alone after the drug
treatment was terminated (Fig. 5I; P < 0.05). Neither significant body weight loss nor treatment-related deaths was
observed throughout the in vivo study (Supplementary
Fig. S3A and S3B). Thus, the more effective and durable
tumor growth inhibitory effect exhibited by the combination
of afatinib with topotecan may be due to the speciﬁc elimination of SP cells in vivo.
Downregulation of ABCG2 by afatinib was independent
of protein degradation pathway but involved in
promoter methylation
The downregulation of ABCG2 protein by afatinib is likely
a universal effect in resistant cancer cells with ABCG2
overexpression because ABCG2 protein was also found to
be decreased by afatinib in a concentration-dependent
manner in MCF7/FLV1000 cells (Fig. 6A). To further understand the mechanism for ABCG2 protein downregulation by
afatinib, the possible involvement of protein degradation
systems by ubiquitin-proteasome, lysosome, and calpain
were evaluated. MG132, Leupeptin, and ALLN were used as
speciﬁc inhibitors of proteasome, lysosome, and calpain,
respectively. None of the inhibitors can block the downregulation of ABCG2 protein after afatinib treatment
(Fig. 6B–D). ABCG2 protein stability was also evaluated
by using cycloheximide to stop protein synthesis and measuring the amount of remaining ABCG2 protein at various
time points after 2.0 mmol/L afatinib treatment by Western
blot analysis (Fig. 6E). The quantitative analyses shown that
afatinib do not alter the half-life of ABCG2 protein (Fig. 6F).
These results indicated that the decrease of ABCG2 protein
caused by afatinib was independent of ubiquitin-proteasome-, lysosome-, and calpain-mediated protein degradation systems.
The regulation of ABCG2 mRNA expression by afatinib
was then examined. The results showed that ABCG2 mRNA
level was reduced by afatinib in a time- and concentrationdependent manner in S1-MI-80 cells (Fig. 6G and H). Similar
ﬁndings were observed in CNE2-s18 cells (Fig. 6I and J).
These data suggest that afatinib inhibited ABCG2 expression
at the mRNA level.
Several mechanisms have been reported to regulate the
mRNA expression of ABCG2 in CSCs, including epigenetic
phenomena (23, 24). It has been shown that CpG methylation
of the ABCG2 promoter could result in its transcriptional
silencing (25). Therefore, we sought to determine whether
afatinib could affect the methylation status of the ABCG2

4440

Cancer Res; 74(16) August 15, 2014

promoter, which lead to a reduction in ABCG2 mRNA
level. According to result from MSP, ABCG2 promoter was
found to be more heavily methylated than untreated cells
(Fig. 7A). Importantly, treatment of cells with 5-Aza-dC
(72 hours), a well-known DNA methyltransferase I inhibitor,
was found to elevate ABCG2 mRNA expression, which was
aaccompanied by a signiﬁcant demethylation of the ABCG2
promoter (Fig. 7A and B).
These results were further corroborated by direct bisulﬁte
sequencing of a 125 bp fragment (ranging from -337 to -213
relative to the transcription initiation site), which was reported
to be a functional CpG island suppressing the expression
of ABCG2 (26). Surprisingly, afatinib evidently increased the
level of CpG methylation in the ABCG2 promoter (Fig. 7C
and D). Treatment with a demethylating agent, 5-Aza-dC, was
able to reduce the extent of ABCG2 promoter methylation
in afatinib-treated cells (Fig. 7D). These results indicated that
afatinib downregulated ABCG2 by inducing methylation of
the gene promoter.
Total DNMT activity was then evaluated to determine
whether the increased ABCG2 methylation by afatinib is associated with a change in DNMT activity. The results showed a
1.6-fold increase in DNMT activity after 2.0 mmol/L afatinib
treatment for 72 hours (Fig. 7E; P < 0.05). Consistent with the
restoration of ABCG2 expression by 5-Aza-dC in afatinibtreated cells, 5-Aza-dC was found to decrease the basal DNMT
activity and prevent the afatinib-induced increase in DNMT
activity (Fig. 7E). Furthermore, afatinib concentration dependently increased DNMT activity (Supplementary Fig. S3B and
S3C). Therefore, both increased ABCG2 promoter methylation
and elevated DNMT activity are involved in the downregulation
of ABCG2 by afatinib.
It has been reported that drug-induced DNA methylation
or demethylation could be either global or site speciﬁc (27, 28).
As a control for comparison, methylation status of the TP53
gene was also evaluated. Interestingly, afatinib did not affect
the promoter methylation of TP53 (Fig. 7F). Therefore, the
increased methylation at the ABCG2 locus after afatinib treatment was likely a site-speciﬁc event.

Discussion
The existence of CSCs has attracted a lot of attention
recently because they are the major contributing factor for
cancer recurrence and metastasis, which severely hindered
successful cancer chemotherapy (29, 30). Importantly, the
multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype of CSCs is responsible for chemotherapeutic failure (31, 32). The most common cause of MDR is the increased drug efﬂux from cancer
cells mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters
including ABCG2 and ABCB1 (P-gp). Recent reports indicate that ABCG2 is highly expressed in stem cells, and
play an important role in the proliferation and self-renewal
of stem cells and in the tissue regeneration process
(2, 33, 34, 35). In pharmacologic assays, the ability of stem
cells to efﬂux a ﬂuorescent Hoechst dye 33342 (a ABCG2
substrate) has been adopted to prospectively identify and
isolate stem cell population (20, 36). Therefore, ABCG2 may

Eradication of Cancer Stem–like Cells by Afatinib

be used as a novel target for the development of chemosensitizing agents to target drug-resistant cancer cells and
to eradicate CSCs.
TKIs represent a new class of highly speciﬁc anticancer
agents, which target various oncogenic signaling pathways in
different cancer types. They were demonstrated to be safe and
effective antitumor drugs used in clinical trials and in clinical
treatment. Recently, the combinations of TKIs with cytotoxic
anticancer drugs have been shown to be effective in treating
drug-resistant cancers. Several TKIs have been found to inhibit
ABCG2 and to sensitize resistant cancer cells to the cytotoxic
effect of ABCG2 substrate anticancer drugs. However, most
reports including our previous studies showed that these TKIs
(including lapatinib and geﬁtinib) reversed ABCG2-mediated
MDR via direct inhibition of the transporter function, but
with no obvious effect on the expression level of ABCG2,
(37, 38). In this study, we found that afatinib can effectively
sensitize cancer stem–like cells to conventional chemotherapeutic agents by suppressing the transport activity and also
downregulating the expression of ABCG2. Importantly, this
reduction in ABCG2 expression by afatinib was associated with
a signiﬁcant decrease in the proportion and the self-renewal
capacity of SP cells in the cancer cell lines tested. Moreover,
afatinib dramatically impaired the tumorigenicity of the SP
cells and suppressed their tumor growth in vivo. It has been
proposed that ABCG2 inhibitors can be divided into two
categories: one inhibiting ABCG2 activity only (static) and the
other one inhibiting ABCG2 activity as well as reducing the
expression of ABCG2 (dynamic; ref. 39). To this end, the current
data suggest that afatinib is a "dynamic" inhibitor of ABCG2,
which makes it distinctive from other TKIs.
Like lapatinib, afatinib inhibits irreversibly EGFR and HER2
kinases, which regulate two important downstream PI3K and
AKT pathways. Several reports indicated that these PI3K and
AKT pathways regulate the activity of ABCG2 and subsequently mediate the SP phenotype (40). A recent report indicated
that the phosphorylation status of AKT was associated with
translocation of ABCG2 (41). Therefore, we also examined the
effect of afatinib on the downstream AKT and ERK kinases by
Western blot analysis. The result indicated that afatinib did not
inhibit the activation of AKT and ERK1/2 up to 4 mmol/L in
both S1 and S1-MI-80 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B).
Moreover, afatinib did not affect the expression of total AKT
and ERK1/2 (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). The lack of
effect on AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by afatinib at its
sensitizing concentration was also noted in CNE2-s18 cells

(Supplementary Fig. S4C). Therefore, the blockade of EGFR
signaling is unlikely to play a signiﬁcant role in the sensitizing
effect of afatinib on the ABCG2-overexpressing cells.
The ABCG2 expression is known to be regulated at
multiple levels. DNA methylation and histone modiﬁcations have been reported to play important roles in the
epigenetic regulation of ABCG2 expression in human renal
carcinoma and drug-resistant cells, respectively (23, 42).
Among all the "dynamic" ABCG2 inhibitors previously
identiﬁed, most of them reduced the expression level of
ABCG2 by the degradation of protein mediated by lysosome and proteasome (43, 44). However, in our study, the
decrease in ABCG2 expression by afatinib was not related
to protein degradation mediated by ubiquitin-proteasome,
lysosome, or calpain. On the other hand, the fact that
afatinib also reduce ABCG2 mRNA level suggests transcriptional regulation.
The ABCG2 promoter is known to contain CpG islands. It has
been reported that demethylation of the ABCG2 promoter is
related to reactivation of the gene and the subsequent ABCG2dependent MDR phenotype (26, 45). To this end, drug-induced
epigenetic modulation of the ABCG2 gene has attracted
increasing attention recently (45–47). Our data showed for
the ﬁrst time that afatinib induced methylation of the ABCG2
promoter, thus leading to a decrease in mRNA level of ABCG2
in S1-MI-80 cells, which has not been reported with other TKIs.
Consistent with this ﬁnding, the reduced ABCG2 mRNA
expression in afatinib-treated cells can be restored by treatment with 5-Aza-dC (a demethylating agent), which was
accompanied by the demethylation of the ABCG2 promoter
(Fig. 7B–D).
A schematic model illustrating the possible targeting of
CSLCs by afatinib is proposed in Fig. 7G. Primary tumor
consists of both highly proliferative tumor cells and the
putative CSLCs. Conventional chemotherapeutic agents kill
primarily the highly proliferative tumor cells. However, the
CSLCs are spared by their high expression of multidrug
transporters (especially, ABCG2), mediating their chemoresistance, and eventually regenerate the tumor. Our data
showed that afatinib targets and eliminates the CSLCs by
reducing ABCG2 expression. Therefore, the combination use
of afatinib with conventional chemotherapeutic agents can
eradicate the whole tumor mass by killing both the highly
proliferative cells and the CSLCs. While the clinical application of the drug combination is advocated, further study is
still warranted to understand fully how afatinib causes

Figure 7. Afatinib caused methylation of the ABCG2 promoter. A, methylation level of ABCG2 was increased by afatinib, which was reversible by 5-AzadC treatment. S1-MI-80 cells were treated by afatinib (2 mmol/L) and 5-Aza-dC (5 mmol/L) for 72 hours. Cells were then harvested for MSP analysis.
B, correlation of ABCG2 mRNA expression with the methylation level. The mRNA expression level of ABCG2 was detected by q-PCR. C, a
simpliﬁed schematic diagram showing the ABCG2 promoter was shown to illustrate the location of the detected CpG sites. The MSP products were
cloned into the pMD18-T vector and then sequenced for analysis of the methylation status of the PCR products. The sequencing results were
analyzed by BiQ Analyzer software. Eight clones were analyzed for each PCR fragment. The black circles represent the methylated CpG and the
white circles represent the unmethylated CpG. D, the methylation level of the CpG island of ABCG2 was measured by the average ratio of
methylated CpGs to all available CpGs within the sequence analyzed. E, effect of afatinib and 5-Aza-dC on DNMT activity. Cells were treated with
afatinib (2 mmol/L) and 5-Aza-dC (5 mmol/L) for 72 hours. Cells were then harvested for analysis of nuclear DNMT activity. F, afatinib did not affect the
methylation status of the TP53 promoter. Data represent the mean  SD.  , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01. G, a schematic model illustrating the targeting of CSCs
