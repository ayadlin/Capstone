ABSTRACT:

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus that is prevalent in the human
population. HCMV has recently been implicated in different cancer forms where
it may provide mechanisms for oncogenic transformation, oncomodulation and
tumour cell immune evasion. Moreover, antiviral treatment against HCMV has been
shown to inhibit tumour growth in preclinical models. Here we describe the possible
involvement of HCMV in cancer and discuss the potential molecular impact expression
of HCMV proteins have on tumour cells and the surrounding tumour microenvironment.

INTRODUCTION

characteristic crucial for the tumour cell to sustain a
proliferative state, evade apoptosis, increase angiogenesis,
invasion, metastasis and suppression of immune responses
[2].
Although it has been both experimentally difficult
and heavily debated, it is today well accepted that
approximately 20% of the global cancer burden can be
linked to infectious agents including viruses, bacteria
and parasites [3]. Recent studies indicate that the list
of infectious agents linked to certain cancer forms will
increase in the future.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a betaherpesvirus that is common in the human population.
Although HCMV is not currently causally implicated
in human cancer, a number of recent evidence suggests
that HCMV may be specifically associated with some
human malignancies. HCMV nucleic acids and proteins
have been detected in 90-100% of glioblastomas and
medulloblastomas, prostate, breast and colon cancers and
in mucoepidermoid carcinomas of salivary glands [4-12].
Consistently, HCMV proteins are not detected in healthy
tissues surrounding HCMV positive tumors. HCMV
protein expression is restricted to the tumour; mainly
in tumour cells, but virus proteins are sometimes found
in endothelial cells and inflammatory cells within the
tumour. However, infectious virus is not recovered from
primary tumours. There is also a discrepancy between the
number of protein positive cells and DNA positive cells

The interplay between cancer cells and the
surrounding microenvironment is essential for the growth
and spread of a tumour. The development of malignant
tumours requires a microenvironment that supports the
uncontrolled proliferation and spread of cancer cells but
also conditions that avoid destruction from the various
arms of the immune system must be present. The immune
system represents an important tool for the destruction of
the majority of cancer cells and precancerous conditions
in the human body. However, malignant growing
tumours have in most, if not all, cases developed immune
evasion strategies to avoid destruction by immune
cells. One essential immune evasion strategy that can
be induced or applied by tumour cells is the formation
of an inflammatory microenvironment. Tumour cells
can induce inflammation directly through oncogenes
that induce transcriptional programs responsible for the
production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, cytokines
and chemokines that attract different cells of the
immune system to the microenvironment. Also chronic
inflammation caused by viral or microbial infections,
autoimmune diseases, dietary products or inflammatory
conditions caused by unknown reasons can create an
inflammatory microenvironment that support tumour
growth [1]. Immune cells that are recruited to the tumour
are generally disabled to eliminate tumour cells. Indeed,
tumour-related inflammation is regarded as one enabling

within the tumour.
We have consistently observed that HCMV proteins
are widespread and easily detected in a majority of tumour
samples, whereas viral DNA is detected only in few cells
within the tumour ([12] and unpublished observations).
Recently, Ranganathan et. al. sequenced viral DNA from
20 different HCMV gene regions in samples obtained from
glioblastoma patients and also found that only a minority
of the cells in the tumour harbour the virus genome
[13]. The authors suggested that HCMV may enhance
the growth or survival of a tumour through mechanisms
that are distinctly different compared to classic tumour
viruses that express transforming viral oncoproteins in
the tumour cells. Thus, it is not likely that HCMV is an
opportunistic virus capable of reactivating in the tumour
and then only infects cells within in the tumour. Instead,
HCMV proteins, rather than a productive infection may
aid the development of HCMV positive tumours through
yet undiscovered mechanisms.

samples [4]. Enhanced telomerase activity is necessary
for tumour cells to divide indefinitely and is commonly
induced by oncogenic viruses [21]. Recently, Melnick
et al. suggested that HCMV fulfils the criteria of Koch´s
Postulates as revised for viruses and cancer, and that
HCMV therefore should be designated as an “oncovirus”
[9]. They demonstrated cell specific localization of HCMV
in 97% of mucoepidermoid carcinomas of salivary glands.
HCMV IE and pp65 were expressed in tumour cells, but
not in non-tumour cells and positively correlated with
severity. HCMV protein expression correlated with
activation of known oncogenic pathways such as epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), Erk and amphiregulin. They also used a mouse salivary
gland organ culture model and showed that murine CMV
infection induces dysplasia through an upregulation of Erk
phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the ErbB receptor
family members and downstream signalling may therefore
be relevant targets for drug discovery also of HCMV
positive tumours [9, 22].
The interaction of HCMV with its cellular receptor
ligands, like integrins, during infection results in the
activation of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway and
expression of IE72 protein in glioblastoma cells induces
constitutive activation of Akt [23, 24]. HCMV has been
shown to also activate the PI3K/Akt signalling cascade
via binding of HCMV proteins to platelet-derived
growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR) and by selective
phosphorylation of the cellular focal adhesion kinase
(FAK) in glioblastoma and prostate cancer cells [25-27]
. Furthermore, HCMV UL38 was shown to interact with
tuberous sclerosis complex resulting in dysregulation of
the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 [28].
HCMV encodes several proteins that interfere with
the cellular apoptotic machinery. Direct anti-apoptotic
activity of HCMV proteins has been located to transcripts
encoded by the HCMV UL36-UL38 genes [29]. CMV
blocks apoptosis mediated by death receptors and
encodes a mitochondria-localized inhibitor of apoptosis
that suppresses apoptosis induced by diverse stimuli.
The HCMV UL37 gene product inhibits Fas-mediated
apoptosis downstream of caspase-8 activation and Bid
cleavage in the mitochondria through inhibition of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak [30, 31].
The HCMV UL36 gene product inhibits Fas-mediated
apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting the function of
caspase-8. [32]. HCMV infection has also been shown to
inhibit apoptosis and induce drug resistance by induction
of the p53 tumour suppressor homologue gene product
ΔN-p73α, resulting in abnormal neural cell survival
[33]. The HCMV IE86 protein binds to p53 and inhibits
its transactivating function and suppresses p53-mediated
apoptosis after DNA damage [26, 34-37]. The HCMV
UL97 protein is a viral homologue of cellular cyclindependent kinases (CDK) that phosphorylates and
inactivates the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor

HCMV; A PROMOTER OF CELLULAR
TRANSFORMATION OR AN ONCOGENIC
VIRUS?
As of today, HCMV is not considered to have direct
oncogenic properties; its potential role in cancer seems
to be oncomodulatory, which imply that expression
of HCMV gene products in cancer cells may promote
tumour growth by enabling different hallmarks of
cancer [2, 14, 15]. However, numerous recent data also
indicate that several HCMV encoded proteins have
biological properties that are directly related to cellular
transformation and tumour development.
The US28 chemokine receptor encoded by HCMV
has several characteristics resembling a viral oncoprotein
[16-19]. Expression of US28 in NIH3T3 cells render
these cells tumourigenic when injected into nude mice
and transgenic mice with targeted expression of US28
to intestinal epithelial cells results in the development
of intestinal neoplasia, which can be enhanced by
inflammation [16]. US28 targeted expression in intestinal
cells inhibits glycogen synthase-3β (GSK-3β) function
resulting in increased β-catenin activity and induced
expression of Wnt target genes, including cyclin D,
survivin and c-myc, that are involved in the control of
cell proliferation [16] . These findings provide a direct
molecular link between the expression of US28 and
oncogenesis. In addition, US28 has also been shown to
activate the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κb)
that is a critical regulator of immunity, stress responses,
apoptosis and differentiation [19, 20].
In glioblastoma cells, we found that the HCMV
IE72 protein directly interacts with the hTERT promoter
at SP1 binding sites to induce telomerase activity and
telomere lengthening [4]. We also found that HCMV-IE72
and hTERT were co-expressed in primary glioblastoma

protein resulting in cell cycle progression and inhibition
of apoptosis in mammalian cells [38].
The functional inhibition of the p53 and Rb families
of tumour suppressor proteins by HCMV encoded proteins
implicates that HCMV is able to promote cell cycle
progression, increase DNA synthesis and block apoptosis
resulting in increased chromosomal instability [39-43]. In
neuroblastoma cells HCMV induces expression of Bcl-2
resulting in inhibition of apoptosis and chemoresistance,
a process that can be reversed by treatment of
neuroblastoma cells with the antiviral drug ganciclovir
[44]. Interestingly, case reports of neuroblastoma
patients have shown increased HCMV antibody titers
and detection of HCMV in urine of small children with
neuroblastoma[45]. HCMV DNA also has been detected
in neuroblastoma tissue sample [45-47]. Unpublished
results from our laboratory demonstrate HCMV DNA,
RNA and proteins in the majority of neuroblastoma tissue
samples and in neuroblastoma cell lines. Treatment of
neuroblastoma cells with the anti-viral drug ganciclovir in
vitro or in vivo inhibits tumour growth (Wolmer-Solberg
2011, submitted).
Hence, HCMV encodes for a number of different
proteins that have profound effects on cellular processes
leading to increased proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis,
stimulation of cellular migration, the release stimulatory
factors, induction chemotherapeutic resistance and
increased telomerase activity.

and encodes approximately 200 proteins, of which only
about 50 are essential for viral replication [49]. Hence,
the majority of HCMV encoded proteins have other
functions in the viral lifecycle and many of these proteins
are involved in immune evasion. For instance, the US11,
US2 and US3 gene products prevent host cell MHC class
I antigen expression that is required for CD8+ cytotoxic
tumour killing. HCMV also induces a specific block in
presentation of peptides of the HCMV encoded IE1
protein; one of the earliest immunodominant HCMV
epitopes [50-52]. US3 and US8 inhibit presentation of
MHC class II molecules on the cell surface and thereby
inhibit CD4 + T cell responses [53, 54]. The HCMV pp65
protein encoded by the UL83 gene redirect HLA class
II molecules to lysosomes where the alpha chain of the
HLADR molecule is degraded [55]. HCMV inhibits NK
mediated lysis by several different strategies; the virus
encodes for an MHC class I homologue that prevents
NK cells to become activated through the missing selfhypothesis. The viral protein UL16 retains the NKG2D
ligands ULBP1, 2 and MIC-B in the ER that are essential
to activate an NK cell response (reviewed in [56]). UL16
also protects the cells from lysis mediated by cytotoxic
peptides [57]. Thus, cancer cells expressing UL16 would
be protected against the action of both NK cells and T
cells. Interestingly, the HCMV encoded UL83 protein
pp65 and IE1/IE2 are frequently detected in both gliomas
and medulloblastomas [11, 12].
We recently showed that HCMV nucleic acids and
proteins are present in the majority of medulloblastoma
primary tumours and cell lines. We also found that US28
(the HCMV encoded chemokine receptor homologue
with potential oncogenic functions) was expressed in
medulloblastoma and induced expression of COX2 in these tumours [12]. Microarray analysis of US28
transfected cells and HCMV infected cells showed that
the expression of COX-2 is highly up-regulated in these
cells as compared to mock-transfected or HCMV negative
cells [17, 39]. Moreover, transgenic mice with targeted
expression of US28 to intestinal epithelial cells exhibit
a hyperplastic intestinal epithelium resulting in tumour
development, indicating that US28 is involved in tumour
initiation and progression [16].
COX-2 is over- expressed in a number of different
adult cancers of epithelial origin as well as in gliomas
where high expression often is correlated with poor
prognosis (reviewed in [58-60]). In paediatric solid
tumours high expression of COX-2 has been found in
neuroblastoma [61, 62] , medulloblastoma [63, 64] and
sarcomas [65]. COX-2 is one of the major enzymes
responsible for the conversion of arachidonic acid to the
pro-inflammatory eicosanoid, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).
Increased levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are perceived
in malignancies of different origin, including brain
tumors [66-68]. PGE2 exerts its physiological effects by
interacting with a subfamily of four distinct G-protein–

HUMAN CYTOMEGALOVIRUS; AN
ENHANCER OF INFLAMMATION AND
INDUCER OF IMMUNE EVASION IN THE
TUMOUR MICROENVIRONMENT
Symptoms of a primary HCMV infection are
usually mild or asymptomatic in immunocompetent
individuals but can cause severe disease in fetuses and
immunocompromised patients such as transplant recipients
and AIDS patients. The virus is spread through all bodily
fluids and establishes a life-long latent/persistent infection.
Reactivation from latency appears to be triggered by
inflammation, which the virus can initiate by inducing
cytokine and chemokine production and by enhancing the
synthesis of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Indeed, the
biological responses elicited by HCMV reactivation mimic
those seen in leukocyte dysfunction, wound healing and
chronic inflammation [14]. HCMV reactivation has also
been shown to stimulate the expression of VEGF that can
induce angiogenesis [17, 18] and inhibit the expression of
the potent anti-angiogenic protein thrombospondin-1 [48].
During evolution HCMV has coevolved with the
human host and the virus has developed several immune
evasion strategies to allow persistent infection and viral
spread without harming its host. HCMV contains a 250
kb ds DNA genome that has 252 open reading frames

coupled receptors designated EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4.
PGE2 promotes tumour growth in an autocrine and/or
paracrine manner by stimulating EP receptor signalling
with subsequent enhancement of cellular proliferation,
promotion of angiogenesis, inhibition of apoptosis and
stimulation of invasion [58]. In addition, PGE2 is an
important mediator for the interaction between tumour
cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment where
PGE2 contributes to the generation of a tumor promoting
inflammatory microenvironment that suppress the activities
from cells in the immune system [58].
Different nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) which inhibit the enzymatic function of
cyclooxygenases and the production of prostaglandins
and other inflammatory mediators has been shown to
be promising agents for the prevention and treatment
of various cancers [69]. Elevated levels of PGE2 are
required for efficient replication of HCMV by facilitating
the production of the HCMV immediate-early 2 protein
[70]. Daily aspirin reduce both the risk of development
of cancer and cancer deaths [71]; the benefit increased
with duration of treatment [72]. Interestingly, NSAIDs
abrogate virus-mediated production of PGE2 and reduce
the virus burden in HCMV infected cells [70, 73]; thus
acting as an anti-viral agent against HCMV. Moreover,
the COX-2 specific NSAID celecoxib reduces the
levels of PGE2 and the expression of HCMV proteins in
medulloblastoma, as well as tumour growth in vitro and
in vivo [12].
US28 that induces the expression of COX-2 in
HCMV infected cells can bind different chemokines,
including CCL2, CCL5, and CX3CL1 [74], and suppress
the host immune responses [75]. Moreover, US28 activates
NF- κB resulting in activation of the IL-6–JAK1–STAT3
signalling axis and increased interleukin-6 (IL-6), VEGF
and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (e-NOS) production
[14, 19]. Analysis of clinical glioblastoma samples in situ
showed co-localization of US28 with phosphorylated
STAT3, COX-2, VEGF and e-NOS, suggesting that
US28 in addition to promoting an inflammatory
microenvironment also contribute to tumour invasiveness
and angiogenesis [14, 19]. Taken together US28 could
provide a target for therapy in HCMV-positive tumours.
HCMV establishes latency in myeloid lineage
cells, and reactivation is dependent on inflammation
and differentiation of monocytes into macrophages
of dendritic cells. HCMV can also persistently infect
monocyte/macrophage lineage cells and induce a strong
inflammatory response in these cells [76]. In human
breast and colon cancer HCMV protein expression has
been detected in infiltrating inflammatory cells in the
tumour microenvironment and in gliomas, macrophages
and microglia cells as well as tumor cells exhibit
positive HCMV protein staining [77, 78]. HCMV
infection of moncyte/macrophages is associated with
an induction of IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TGF-β
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that are potent cytokines with both immune stimulating
and immunosuppressive effects on the host anti-tumour
response [1, 79]. In particular, CMVIL-10 and TGF-β
would provide an immunosuppressive microenvironment
in HCMV positive tumours [80, 81]. These evidences
raise the prospect that a persistent HCMV infection could
induce the same kind of “smoldering” inflammation
at the same time as it creates an immunosuppressive
environment, which is frequently observed in the tumour
microenvironment [1, 78].

HCMV AS A GUARDIAN OF CANCER STEM
CELLS
HCMV is a neurotropic virus that can persistently
infect neural precursor cells. As a consequence HCMV
is the major infectious cause of birth defects in infants,
including sensori-neural hearing loss or neuronal migration
disturbances during brain development, and in the most
severe cases, microcephaly or anencephaly. We have
demonstrated that HCMV can block the ability of neural
progenitor cells to differentiate into neurons or astrocytes
[82, 83]. HCMV DNA and gene products have repeatedly
been detected by several laboratories in preneoplastic
and neoplastic tumour cells in human glioblastoma tissue
samples and the fractions of tumour cells infected with
HCMV correlate significantly with tumour staging and
patient survival [5, 84]. We recently reported that the
majority of primary human medulloblastoma and cell lines
propagated for years in laboratories contain HCMV DNA,
RNA and express HCMV IE and late proteins [12]. Our
unpublished data also demonstrate that HCMV is present
in the majority of childhood primary neuroblastoma and
cell lines, an observation which is consistent with other
reports [15, 45].
Medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma are embryonal
tumours of the central and peripheral nervous systems,
respectively. Compared to adult tumours, paediatric
tumours generally have a dramatically shortened latency
period and harbour fewer genetic aberrations causing
oncogene activation or loss of apoptotic regulators. The
reason for these differences is that these malignancies
probably arise from stem or progenitor cells which
already possess proliferative capacity as a part of the
normal developmental process [85]. Medulloblastoma
and neuroblastoma are linked to dysfunctional pathways
that are operative during normal development [85]. The
clinical presentation and treatment response also suggests
that a tumour initiating cell population exist in these
tumours [86-91].
Although the cellular origin of gliomas still is
contended, recent evidence suggests that multipotent
neural stem or progenitors of the subventricular zone
(SVZ) are cells with the potential to form gliomas
[92]. Subpopulations of CD133+ and/or CD15+ cells in
both medulloblastomas and glioblastomas have been
1332

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 1329 - 1338

recognized as potential cancer stem cells [89, 93]. In
neuroblastoma, on the other hand, no true marker for
potential cancer stem cells have been found, although
CD133 and CD44 are implied as potential markers [88].
We have detected HCMV DNA, RNA and proteins in
medulloblastoma, glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cell
lines used world-wide for decades in laboratories, which
may indicate that the virus in condemned in a stem cell
that is maintained in culture and gives rise to tumours
[12]. We observed that the expression of HCMV proteins
in both medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines
varied considerably between different sampling occasions
over a one year period, and that protein expression
increased when the cells were engrafted in nude mice.
We therefore hypothesize that HCMV DNA and proteins
are maintained in a stem-cell like phenotype. Indeed we
observed HCMV protein expression in the majority of
CD133+ medulloblastoma cells whereas in neuroblastoma
this number varied between 4-34% depending on cell line
and sampling time ([12], and unpublished observations).
Likewise, in glioblastoma tissue samples 40-60% of the
CD133+ cell population expressed HCMV IE1 [14] and
our own unpublished observations). These data indicate
that HCMV is present in tumour cells that express stem
cell markers, and that the virus is maintained in cell lines
over long periods of time. The fact that HCMV is able to
inhibit the differentiation of neural progenitor cells raises
the possibility that HCMV encoded proteins are involved
in the maintenance of a cancer stem cell population within
neural tumours.

effects inhibiting cellular proliferation.
Medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma and glioblastoma
tumors express high levels of COX-2 and NSAIDs,
inhibitors of COX-2 and PGE2 production, have profound
effects on the growth of these tumours [64, 94-96]. These
inhibitors also efficiently prevent HCMV replication
and reduce the growth of US28-expressing tumour cells
[17, 18, 70, 73]. Hence, the beneficial effects seen with
aspirin and other NSAIDs in cancer prevention studies
could partly be due to inhibition of HCMV replication
in pre-malignant lesions. Compared to conventional
chemotherapeutic drugs currently used for the treatment
of these tumours, both antiviral drugs for HCMV and
NSAIDs are well tolerated. Hence, these drugs should
undergo clinical testing in combination with conventional
therapies in patients carrying HCMV-infected tumours.
In a randomized double-blinded phase II study we
are currently evaluating antiviral drugs against HCMV
as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma. Results from
this study are expected to be ready soon. Also a phase
I/II immunotherapy clinical trial of autologous HCMV
pp65 RNA loaded dendritic cells has been initiated in
which 13 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma
multiforme were enrolled. Initial results from this study
are promising. Patients exhibited a median progressionfree survival of 15.4 months and overall survival of 20.6
months, numbers which are highly significant compared to
historical controls [97].
The promising preclinical and clinical results
obtained using antiviral drugs against HCMV to treat
tumours carrying HCMV should be extended to include
larger controlled clinical trials. Also, developing drugs
that specifically inhibit the functions of HCMV encoded
US28 may be of future benefit in cancer treatment since
the US28 protein may possess important functions in
tumour initiation through the activation of intracellular
signalling pathways, angiogenesis and effects on the
tumour microenvironment.

ANTI-HCMV THERAPY AS A TREATMENT
OPTION FOR CERTAIN CANCERS
The findings that several cancer forms are HCMV
positive, including those with a neural origin that usually
have a dismal prognosis, opens up the possibility to treat
these cancers with anti-viral drugs against HCMV. In
nude mice engrafted with human medulloblastoma cells,
the antiviral drug valganciclovir, significantly inhibited
tumour growth. Interestingly the treatment effect was
extensively enhanced when valganciclovir was combined
with the COX-2 specific inhibitor celecoxib [12], which is
known to also inhibit HCMV infection. Importantly, the
inhibition of tumour growth clearly corresponded with
reduction in the expression of late HCMV proteins in
these tumours. However, neither valganciclovir by itself
or in combination with celecoxib was able to completely
eliminate the HCMV presence. In sharp contrast,
valganciclovir had no effect neither on the clonogenic
capacity or tumour growth of two HCMV-negative cell
lines derived from prostate and pancreas adenocarcinomas
[12]. This strongly suggests that the inhibitory effect of
valganciclovir on medulloblastoma growth is HCMV
specific and not mediated by potential non-specific drug

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
The presence and functions of HCMV in cancer
is still debated and scepticism vestiges regarding the
relationship between HCMV and cancer. This mainly
originates from conflicting results regarding the detection
of HCMV in tumour samples and since HCMV by
itself not has been shown to transform normal cells into
cancer cells [47]. The last statement has recently been
challenged since the HCMV encoded chemokine receptor
homologue US28 renders NIH3T3 cells tumorigenic
when injected into nude mice and transgenic mice with
targeted expression to intestinal epithelial cells develop
intestinal neoplasia [16, 18, 19]. Compared to the high
degree of HCMV replication and protein expression seen
in primary HCMV infections and in HCMV reactivation
in immunocompromised individuals, the expression
1333

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 1329 - 1338

of viral proteins in cancer cells is very low. The term
“microinfection” has been used to describe the low levels
of HCMV infection found in cancer [84]. Clearly, the
infection is different in cells that replicate the virus and
produce infectious virus compared to tumour cells in
vivo; in spite of the fact that several HCMV proteins are
expressed, infectious virus are not isolated from tumour
cells of primary tumors, primary tumour cell cultures or
established tumour cell lines. Therefore, as detection of
HCMV in cancer cells using standard protocols developed
for the detection of active HCMV infection associated with
a high HCMV replication rate and high-level expression
of HCMV proteins is usually insufficient in these cases ,
it is believed that low levels of HCMV exists in tumours
[13, 15]. However, using flow cytometry examining fresh
tumour cells or indirect immunofluorescence examining
frozen tumor biopsy specimens, we demonstrated the
feasibility of detecting HCMV proteins in primary
tumour cells from medulloblastoma, glioblastoma and
neuroblastoma patients (Wolmer-solberg, submitted,
[12, 98]). Research laboratories that have shown a high
prevalence of HCMV nucleic acids and proteins in tumour
samples have used highly sensitive immunohistochemical
and molecular methods in order to detect the presence of
HCMV.
As of today HCMV has been detected in glioma,
medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, breast, prostate and
colon cancer and mucoepidermoid tumors of the salivary
gland. Although the exact molecular functions of HCMV
in these tumours still need to be further investigated, the
findings that antiviral HCMV treatment inhibit the growth
of certain tumours ([12], Wolmer-Solberg, unpublished)
is exciting and future studies will elucidate whether these
antiviral therapies should be included as an adjuvant
treatment for patients having HCMV-positive tumours.
