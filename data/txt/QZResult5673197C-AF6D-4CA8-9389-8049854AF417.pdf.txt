Abstract

Author Manuscript

The naked mole-rat displays exceptional longevity, with a maximum lifespan exceeding 30
years1–3. This is the longest reported lifespan for a rodent species and is especially striking
considering the small body mass of the naked mole-rat. In comparison, a similarly sized house
mouse has a maximum lifespan of 4 years4,5. In addition to their longevity, naked mole-rats show
an unusual resistance to cancer. Multi-year observations of large naked mole-rat colonies did not
detect a single incidence of cancer2,6. Here we identify a mechanism responsible for the naked
mole-rat’s cancer resistance. We found that naked mole-rat fibroblasts secrete extremely high
molecular weight hyaluronan (HA), which is over five times larger than human or mouse HA.
This high molecular weight HA accumulates abundantly in naked mole rat tissues due to the
decreased activity of HA-degrading enzymes and a unique sequence of hyaluronan synthase 2
(HAS2). Furthermore, the naked mole-rat cells are more sensitive to HA signaling, as the naked
mole rat cells have a higher affinity to HA than the mouse or human cells. Perturbation of the
signaling pathways sufficient for malignant transformation of mouse fibroblasts fails to transform
naked mole-rat cells. However, once high molecular weight HA is removed by either knocking
down HAS2 or overexpressing the HA-degrading enzyme, Hyal2, naked mole-rat cells become

susceptible to malignant transformation and readily form tumors in mice. We speculate that naked
mole-rats have evolved a higher concentration of HA in the skin to provide skin elasticity needed
for life in underground tunnels. This trait may have then been co-opted to provide cancer
resistance and longevity to this species.
Mice and rats are standard animal models for cancer research due in part to their short
lifespan and high incidence of cancer. However, these traits imply that mice and rats have
fewer anticancer mechanisms, and novel tumor resistance mechanisms are less likely to be
discovered using these models. Here we focused our research on a small rodent, the naked
mole-rat, which in contrast to mice and rats, is long-lived and cancer resistant.

Author Manuscript

Our previous studies identified a novel anticancer mechanism in the naked mole-rat, termed
early contact inhibition (ECI)7. Contact inhibition is a process of arresting cell growth when
cells come in contact with each other or the extracellular matrix. Contact inhibition is a
powerful anticancer mechanism that is lost in cancer cells8. Naked mole-rat cells arrest at a
much lower density than mouse cells, and the loss of the ECI makes cells more susceptible
to malignant transformation7. However, the signals triggering ECI in naked mole-rats
remained unknown.

While culturing multiple lines of naked mole-rat fibroblasts we noticed that the culture
media became very viscous after a few days. Viscosity measurements confirmed that the
media conditioned by the naked mole-rat cells was more viscous than the media conditioned
by human, guinea pig, or mouse cells (Figure 1a). We included the guinea pig because it is
phylogenetically closer to the naked mole-rat than the mouse. We identified the viscous
“substance” secreted by the naked mole-rat fibroblasts as high molecular weight HA
(HMW-HA). Treatment with hyaluronidase (HAase) that specifically digests HA reduced
the media viscosity to background levels (Figure 1a). Naked mole-rat embryonic fibroblasts,
which do not display ECI, did not increase viscosity of the culture media (Figure 1a, and
Supplementary Figure 1).
HA is an unbranched disaccharide glucuronic acid/N-acetylglucosamine polymer and is one
of the major components of the extracellular matrix9. Biological responses triggered by HA
depend on the HA polymer length. HMW-HA represses mitogenic signaling and has antiinflammatory properties10, while low molecular weight HA promotes proliferation and
inflammation11.

Analysis of HA from tissue culture media using pulse field electrophoresis showed that the
HA secreted by naked mole-rat cells has a molecular weight of 6–12 MDa, while mouse and
guinea pig HA ranges from 0.5–3 MDa (Figure 1b); human HA has a molecular weight of
0.5–2 MDa12. Naked mole-rat embryonic fibroblasts did not secrete HMW-HA (Figure 1b).
Importantly, a mutated clone NMR SF Mut, which spontaneously lost the ECI phenotype
and p16INK4a expression7, still produced HMW-HA (Figure 1a, b), indicating that the
physical presence of HMW-HA is not sufficient for the ECI phenotype; rather the intact
signaling pathway leading from HMW-HA to induction of p16 is required. These
experiments establish HMW-HA as the extracellular signal that triggers ECI.

In vertebrate cells HA is produced by HA synthases HAS1, 2, and 3, that differ in tissue
distribution and the size of HA produced13. Naked mole-rat skin fibroblasts overexpressed
HAS2, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of HMW-HA in comparison with mouse
and human fibroblasts (Figure 1c). Naked mole-rat embryonic fibroblasts, which do not
secrete HMW-HA, did not show increased levels of HAS2. The levels of HAS1 and HAS3
were similar between mouse, human, and naked mole-rat cells (Figure 1c). Collectively,
these results show that naked mole-rat cells, which display ECI, secrete HA of exceptionally
high molecular weight.

Hyaluronan synthases are highly conserved in vertebrates. The HAS2 protein has 98.7%
identity and 100% similarity between human and mouse. We cloned and sequenced HAS2
cDNA from the naked mole-rat and compared it to other mammalian HAS2 genes (Figure
1d). Two Asparagines that are 100% conserved among mammals were replaced with Serines
in the naked mole-rat HAS2. This change occurs in no other mammalian HAS2 genes
deposited in GenBank, including the naked mole-rat’s close relative, the guinea pig. HAS2
contains seven putative transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic loop14. The conserved
regions carrying Asparagine to Serine substitutions correspond to the cytoplasmic loop
containing the enzyme’s active site. These unique amino acid changes may be responsible
for the high processivity of the naked mole-rat HAS2. Indeed, when the cDNA for the naked
mole-rat HAS2 was overexpressed in human HEK293 cells, they began secreting HMW-HA
(Figure 2a).

We then examined whether naked mole-rat tissues contain high levels of HA in comparison
to mouse and guinea pig. Tissue sections were stained with alcian blue, and control samples
were treated with HAase prior to staining to show that the staining is specific to HA. Naked
mole-rat skin, heart, brain and kidney were highly enriched for HA (Figure 2b,
Supplementary Figure 2). Furthermore, the HA extracted from naked mole-rat tissues had a
higher molecular weight than HA from mouse tissues (Supplementary Figure 3). These
results indicate that production of HMW-HA by naked mole-rat cells is not an artifact of
tissue culture, but a unique in vivo property of this species.
HA levels are regulated by HA-degrading enzymes, HAases15. We measured HAase activity
in naked mole-rat, mouse and human cells by quantifying HA degradation after incubation
with these cells. HAase activity of the naked mole-rat cells was much lower than that of
human, mouse or guinea pig cells (Figure 2c). Similarly, HAase activity was lower in the
naked mole-rat tissues than in the mouse tissues (Figure 2d). These results indicate that two
mechanisms contribute to accumulation of HMW-HA in the naked mole-rat: more robust
synthesis and slower degradation.

We previously demonstrated that ECI contributes to cancer resistance of the naked mole-rat
by arresting cell cycle via the induction of p16INK4a 7. To determine the role of HMW-HA
in ECI we cultured naked mole-rat fibroblasts in the presence of bacterial HAase. Enzymatic
digestion of HMW-HA abrogated the ECI phenotype and caused naked mole-rat cells to
grow to complete confluence (Figure 3a, b). Upon subsequent removal of HAase from the
culture media, a fraction of cells detached from the plate and died by apoptosis

(Supplementary Figure 4), while the remaining cells re-acquired the ECI phenotype (Figure
3c).
CD44 is a major HA receptor in human and mouse cells9,11,16. To confirm that HA
signaling triggers ECI via the CD44 receptor we cultured naked mole-rat cells in the
presence of a CD44-blocking antibody. Naked mole-rat cells grown with CD44 antibodies
reached a higher cell density (Figure 3b) indicating that the ECI signal from HMW-HA is in
part transmitted via the CD44 receptor.
We then used a Flow cytometric assay to measure the affinity of the naked mole-rat cells to
fluorescently labeled HA. Naked mole-rat cells displayed a two-fold higher affinity to HA
than mouse or human cells (Figure 3d), which can contribute to higher sensitivity of naked
mole rat cells to HA signaling.

Author Manuscript

On the cytoplasmic face, the CD44 receptor interacts with NF2 (merlin), which mediates
contact inhibition17. The phosphorylated, growth promoting, form of NF2 appeared in naked
mole-rat cells grown in the presence of HAase, while cells cultured without HAase
contained mainly the unphosphorylated growth-inhibitory form of NF2 (Supplementary
Figure 5). We previously showed that ECI is associated with induction of p16INK4a, while
the NMR SF Mut cells that do not display ECI have lost p16INK4a expression7. Accordingly,
naked mole-rat cells grown in the presence of HAase displayed reduced levels of p16INK4a
(Supplementary Figure 5). Collectively these results establish that ECI is controlled by the
HA/CD44/NF2 pathway.

We then tested the role of HMW-HA in the resistance of naked mole-rat cells to malignant
transformation in a soft agar assay. SV40 Large T antigen (SV40 LT) is a viral oncoprotein
that binds and inactivates p53 and pRb. The mutant derivative LTK1 (K1) inactivates only
p53, while LTΔ434–444 (Δ434) inactivates only pRb and its family members18. A
combination of H-Ras V12 and SV40 LT is sufficient to transform mouse fibroblasts19, but,
as we showed earlier, is not sufficient to confer anchorage independent growth to naked
mole-rat cells7. To test the role of HMW-HA in the naked mole-rat’s resistance to
transformation, we transfected naked mole-rat fibroblasts with H-Ras V12 combined with
SV40 LT or its mutants K1 or Δ434 and cultured them in soft agar in the presence of HAase.
Under these conditions, cells transfected with H-Ras V12 and SV40 LT, or H-Ras V12 and
Δ434 formed robust colonies (Figure 4a). Similarly, naked mole rat cells cultured in the
presence of CD44 blocking antibody formed colonies in soft agar (Supplementary Figure 6).
These results demonstrate that if HMW-HA is degraded by HAase or HA signaling is
blocked by a CD44 antibody, naked mole-rat cells become susceptible to anchorageindependent growth triggered by H-Ras V12 and SV40 LT. In embryonic naked mole-rat
fibroblasts, which do not secrete HMW-HA, H-Ras V12 and SV40 LT or Δ434 were
sufficient to trigger anchorage-independent growth (Supplementary Figure 6).
We then generated H-Ras V12 and SV40 LT expressing naked mole-rat cells, in which
HMW-HA was abolished by either integrating shRNA targeting HAS2 (Supplementary
Figure 7a) or overexpressing an HA-degrading enzyme Hyal2 (Supplementary Figure 7b).
These cells no longer increased the viscosity of their culture media (Supplementary Figure

7c) and readily formed colonies in soft agar (Supplementary Figure 8). To confirm that
HMW-HA inhibits tumor formation in vivo, we performed xenograft experiments with
naked mole-rat cells containing a knockdown of HAS2, or overexpressing Hyal2 (Figure
4b). In the positive control, mouse cells expressing H-Ras V12 and SV40 LT readily formed
tumors in mice. Naked mole-rat cells expressing H-Ras V12 and SV40 LT did not form
tumors, consistent with an earlier report20. Remarkably, naked mole-rat cells expressing HRas V12 and SV40 LT and shRNA to HAS2 or overexpressing Hyal2 formed tumors in
mice. This experiment establishes HMW-HA, produced by HAS2, as a key component
responsible for the elevated cancer resistance of the naked mole-rat.

The HMW-HA in the naked mole-rat could have evolved as an adaptation to subterranean
lifestyle to provide flexible skin needed to squeeze through underground tunnels.
Interestingly, we found that cells of a different subterranean rodent, the blind mole-rat,
which is phylogenetically closer to mice and rats than to the naked mole-rat also secreted
HMW-HA (Supplementary Figure 9). In summary, our results demonstrate that extremely
HMW-HA, its binding to the CD44 receptor, and lower HAase activity play a key role in
mediating the cancer resistance of the naked mole-rat. Using naked mole-rat HMW-HA in
the clinic or targeting Hyal2, or the HA-CD44 signaling pathway opens new avenues for
cancer prevention and life extension.

Methods
Animals

Author Manuscript

All animal experiments were approved and performed in accordance with guidelines set up
by the University of Rochester Committee on Animal Resources. Naked mole-rats were
from the University of Rochester colonies. C57BL/6 mice and NIH III nude mice (NIH-Lyst
bg-JFoxn1nu Btk xid) were purchased from Charles River Labs. Non-albino guinea pigs
were obtained from Elm Hill Labs. Cells and tissues were obtained from at least three
different animals.
Cell culture

Author Manuscript

Primary mouse, guinea pig, blind mole-rat and naked mole-rat cells were isolated from lung
and underarm skin. Cells were obtained from five naked mole-rats, three mice, three guinea
pigs, and three blind mole-rats. The growth characteristics, and HA secretion did not differ
between the cell lines from different animals therefore we performed the experiments on
three skin cell lines from three animals. All cell lines were used at early passage (<12–15
PDs). Human primary skin fibroblasts HCA2 were a kind gift from Olivia Pereira-Smith.
Embryonic naked mole rat fibroblasts were isolated from eight mid-gestation embryos.
Mouse, human, guinea pig and blind mole-rat cells were cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2, 3% O2;
naked mole-rat cells were cultured at 32°C, 5% CO2, 3% O2 on treated polystyrene culture
dishes (Corning) in EMEM media (ATCC) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum
(Gibco), nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml
streptomycin (Gibco).

Viscosity Assay

Author Manuscript

To determine relative kinematic viscosity, 3 ml of distilled H2O, unused complete EMEM
media, or media conditioned with naked mole-rat, mouse, or human cells were run through a
0.6 mm capillary Ostwald viscometer (Barnstead International) at 22°C and timed for the
passage of the media or distilled H2O through the capillary. For HAase control, naked molerat media was treated with hyaluronidase 1 U/ml HAase from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus
(Sigma-Aldrich). The relative viscosity of unused and conditioned media was determined by
comparing times required to pass through the capillary to that of distilled H2O. Samples
were run three times to determine an average relative viscosity.
Cell growth analysis

Author Manuscript

To measure cell proliferation and the confluent density, cells were seeded on 60 mm gridded
plates (Corning). Three 2×2 mm squares were marked on each plate and the number of cells
in those squares was counted each day for 20 days. For cell growth in the presence of
HAase, 24 hours post plating the media was changed to media containing 3 U/ml HAase
(Sigma). Media was then replaced with fresh media containing the enzyme every 48 hours.
Images of the squares were taken using SPOT Advanced (Diagnostic Instruments) and
analyzed using the colony counting program on ImageQuant TL (GE). The average count of
the three squares for each day was multiplied by 458.33 to give the total cell count per 10
cm plate. Cell count data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel.
To calculate maximum cell number cells were harvested from the confluent plates and
counted using Z2 Coulter counter (Beckman Coulter). Every sample was counted three
times and the averages were used to calculate the maximum cell number from at least three
independent experiments.

HA analysis by pulse field gel electrophoresis

Author Manuscript

HA was purified from conditioned media (typically at day 20) by first treating 2 ml of
conditioned media with 500 μg of Proteinase K (Roche) at 50 °C for 45 minutes to remove
proteins. Samples were then precipitated by adding 2 ml of 100% ethanol. The pellet was
dissolved in 500 μl TE Buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following day, aliquots
were removed and control samples treated with 1 U/ml of HAase from Streptomyces
hyalurolyticus(Sigma-Aldrich). Twenty-five μl of each sample was mixed with 5 μl 4M
sucrose loading solution and loaded to a 0.4% pulse field SeaKem Gold agarose gel
(Cambrex). Ten μl of HA molecular size markers; HiLadder (~500 kDA to ~1,500 kDa) and
Mega-HA Ladder (1,500 kDa to 6,000 kDa) (from Hyalose) were run to determine the size
of HA from each sample. Samples were run overnight at 4 °C at 75 volts with a 1 to 10
running ratio in TBE buffer using CHEF-DRII system (Bio-Rad). The gel was next stained
in a method adapted from21. Briefly, the gel was placed in a 0.005% (w/v) Stains-All
(Sigma-Aldrich) in 50% ethanol solution overnight. To de-stain, the gel was placed in
distilled H2O for 18-hours in the dark and then placed under ambient light in distilled H2O
for 1 hour to complete the final de-staining stages and then photographed under white light.
The amount of HA was quantified by counting pixels using Image J software.

HA extraction from tissues

Author Manuscript

Tissues were excised immediately after sacrificing the animals and weighed. Tissues were
chopped and the same amount of tissues were digested at 50°C overnight in the digestion
buffer containing 10 mM Tris-Cl, 25 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS and 0.1 mg/ml
proteinase K (Roche). Then 27 mM MgCl2 was added to chelate EDTA and Pefabloc SC
was added to inhibit Proteinase K. 500-unit Benzonase® endonuclease (Sigma-Aldrich) was
added to remove nucleic acid. The complete digestion of DNA and RNA was confirmed by
running the agarose gel and staining with ethidium bromide (Bio-Rad). Total polysaccharide
extraction was performed by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol
precipitation. Finally, corresponding volume (100ul/100mg) of 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.5) was
added to dissolve the pellet.
Expression of naked mole rat HAS2 gene in human cells

Author Manuscript

HEK293 cells were transfected with an expression vector containing HAS2 under the CMV
promoter and allowed to express HAS2 for 2 days, after which HA secreted into the media
was analyzed by pulse-field gel. Control cells were transfected with a GFP expression
vector.
HAase activity assay

Author Manuscript

Culture media containing HMW-HA secreted by naked mole-rat cells was mixed 1:1 with
fresh media and incubated with 2 × 105 naked mole-rat fibroblasts, human diploid
fibroblasts, mouse fibroblasts, or HeLa cells for four days. Then the media was harvested,
HA was extracted and analyzed on a pulse-field gel as described above. HA levels before
and after incubation were compared as a measure of HAase activity. For analysis of tissues,
corresponding tissues were chopped into 1 mm cubes and washed twice with PBS. HMWHA containing media was incubated with equal amounts (by weight) of tissue fragments of
each tissue type for six hours and HA levels were analyzed as above.
Antibodies
The following antibodies were used: HAS1 (ab104864 Abcam), HAS2 (sc-66916 Santa
Cruz), HAS3 (sc-66917 Santa Cruz), α-tubulin (ab4074 Abcam), CD44 (Monoclonal Mouse
IgG2A Clone #2C5, Catalog Number BBA10, R&D Systems), NF2/Merlin (ab30329
Abcam), p16 (ab14244 Abcam), Hyal2 (ab68608bAbcam).
Tissue staining

Author Manuscript

HA detection in tissues was done as follows. Tissue samples from young animals (3 year old
naked mole-rats, 3–5 months old mice, 1 year old guinea pigs) were fixed in 10% buffered
neutral formalin, embedded in paraffin and quadruple sections cut at 5 μm were mounted on
glass slides. Slides were deparaffinized and hydrated in distilled H2O. They were then
placed in Coplin jars containing 40 ml of hyaluronidase digestion solution (40 U
hyaluronidase from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus (Sigma) in 40 mL of PBS) for the samples
to be digested or in 40 ml of PBS for the non-digested samples. The jars were microwaved
for one minute at 60 W and then transferred to a 37 °C oven for 1 hour. The slides were
rinsed four times in distilled H2O, followed by three rinses with 3% acetic acid. Next, slides

were placed in new Coplin jars containing 1.0% filtered alcian blue solution at pH 2.5
(Alcian Blue 8GX, C.I. 74240 (Leica) in 3% acetic acid and microwaved at 60 W for 3
minutes followed by an additional 5 minute incubation in the hot 1.0% alcian blue solution.
Slides were rinsed three times in distilled H2O, dehydrated in graded alcohols and rinsed
three times in xylene. Images were taken by light microscopy.
Naked mole-rat cell growth assays with CD44 antibody

Author Manuscript

Naked mole-rat cells were seeded 50 cells/square onto cell culture treated 6 cm polystyrene
gridded tissue culture plates (Corning). Twenty-four hours post plating, the media was
changed to contain 5 μg/ml of CD44 specific antibody (Monoclonal Mouse IgG2A Clone
#2C5, Catalog Number BBA10, R&D Systems) or no antibody control. Media was changed
every 24-hours and images were taken daily using SPOT Advanced imaging software
(Diagnostic Instruments). Images from three different squares from two independent plates
were counted from both the CD44 antibody treated or control groups.
HA affinity assay
Naked mole-rat and mouse cells were harvested at subconfluent exponential phase. One
hundred thousand (105) cells of each type were incubated for 45 min on ice in 210 μl PBS
containing 1.5% Fetal Calf Serum and 35 μg/ml fluorescein-labeled HA (FluoresceinLabeled HA from Bovine Trachea, sc-221733, Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA). Five
thousand cells from each replicate were analyzed by FACS. The experiment was repeated
four times.
Transfections

Author Manuscript

Naked mole-rat skin fibroblasts were seeded at 2×105 cells/100 mm plate seven days prior to
transfection. Mouse skin fibroblasts were seeded at 5×105 cells/100 mm plate two days prior
to transfection. For transfection, cells were harvested, counted and 106 cells were transfected
with 5 μg of plasmid DNA using Amaxa Nucleofector II on program U-020 and solution
NHDF (Amaxa). After transfection, cells were seeded at 2×105 live cells per 10 cm plate for
apoptosis analysis and 7×104 live cells per 6 cm grid plates (Corning) for cell growth
analysis in the same media as stated above. Media was replaced 24 hours post transfection to
remove dead cells due to electroporation.
Anchorage-independent soft agar growth assay

One million mouse, naked mole-rat wild type and naked mole-rat mutant exponentially
growing skin fibroblast cells were transfected by Amaxa with the following plasmid DNA
mixtures: 5 μg pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) and 5 μg pSG5 Large T (Addgene 9053), 5 μg pRasV12 (Clontech) and 5μg pSG5 Large T, 5 μg pRas-V12 and 5μg pSG5 Large T K1
(Addgene 9055), or 5μg pRas-V12 and 5μg pSG5 Large T Δ434–444 (Addgene 9054). After
transfection, cells were seeded and allowed to recover for 24 hours on 10 cm treated
polystyrene plates (Corning) in 1X Minimum Essential Medium, Eagle with Earle’s
Balances salt Solution supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (Gibco). The
following day, a 2 ml final solution of 0.5% Difco Agar Noble (BD Bioscience) and 1X

solidify in incubators at 37°C. After harvesting and counting cells transfected 24 hours
previous, 50 to 50,000 cells were serially diluted and resuspended in 1 ml of 2X media. This
cell suspension was then quickly mixed with 1 ml 0.7% liquid Difco Agar Noble, making a
final 0.35% agar/1X media solution, and seeded on top of the solidified 0.5%/1X media.
Plates were incubated at 32 °C, 5% CO2, ad 3% O2 for twenty-four hours before the addition
of 1ml of EMEM media with or without HAase from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus (Sigma)
at 3 U/ml. To test the effect of CD44 antibody, 5 μg/ml of CD44 antibody (BBA10, R&D
Systems) was added and changed daily. Cells were grown for six weeks, with the removal of
old liquid EMEM media and the addition of 1 ml of new EMEM with or without 3 U/ml
HAase every 48 hours to ensure efficient digestion of HMW-HA. Plates were monitored
every 48 hours and photographed at week 3 (mouse cells) and week 6 (naked mole-rat cells)
after plating at 200x on a Nikon TS100 phase contract microscope using SPOT software

Transfection grade plasmids were prepared with EndoFree plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen) and
linearized with ScaI. One μg linearized plasmid was transfected into ~1×106 cells by
Nucleofector (Amaxa) with U20 program, followed by G418 selection at 1 mg/ml for 2
weeks. Clones that stably expressed the shRNA were picked and expanded to characterize
the knockdown efficiency. Clones with highest levels of HAS knockdown efficiency or the
best Hyal2 expression were used for the in vivo xenograft assay.

Tumor xenograft assay

Author Manuscript

NIH-III nude mice (Crl:NIH-Lystbg-J Foxn1nuBtkxid) were purchased from Charles river
Laboratories Inc. (Wilmington, MA, USA). Seven-week-old female mice were used to
establish xenografts. For each injection, 4 × 106 cells were harvested and resuspended in 100
μl of ice-cold 20% matrigel (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ) in PBS (Gibco). This 100
μl solution was injected subcutaneously close to the base of the external ear or into the flank
just in front of the hind legs with 22 gauge needle. Transplantations of MSF-LT-Ras cells
were allowed to grow for 2–3 weeks, while xenografts with NMR cells were allowed to
grow for 65 days before sacrifice. Tumors were excised and size and weight were recorded.
The mice were dissected and tumor metastasis was examined for each organ.

Figure 1. Naked mole-rat cells secrete HA of exceptionally high molecular weight

Author Manuscript

(a) Naked mole-rat cells make the culture media viscous. The viscosity of water, media or
media conditioned with human skin (HSF), guinea pig skin (GP SF), mouse skin (MSF) or
naked mole-rat skin (NMR SF) fibroblasts for 20 days. The NMR SF + HAase bar shows
naked mole-rat conditioned media digested with HAase to specifically digest HA. The NMR
SF Mut are naked mole-rat skin fibroblasts that spontaneously lost the ECI phenotype7. The
NMR EF are naked mole-rat embryonic fibroblasts that do not show ECI. The experiment
was repeated three times; error bars show s.d. (b) Purified HA separated on pulse-field gel.
Each sample was either run intact or pre-digested with HAase. The experiment was repeated
five times, using both skin and lung fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure 9), and a
representative gel is shown. (c) Western blot showing the levels of HA synthases in naked
mole-rat adult skin fibroblasts, naked mole-rat embryonic fibroblasts, human skin fibroblasts
or mouse skin fibroblasts. (d) Conserved catalytic domain of mammalian HAS2 proteins.

Figure 2. Naked mole-rat tissues contain high levels of HA

Author Manuscript

(a) Naked mole-rat HAS2 overexpressed in human HEK293 cells secretes HMW-HA. Small
panel on the right shows immunoblot with anti HAS2 antibodies on whole cell extracts from
the control and HAS2-transfected cells. (b) Tissues from the naked mole-rat, mouse, and
guinea pig stained with Alcian Blue. The control samples treated with HAase do not show
blue staining, demonstrating that the staining is specific to HA. Staining was performed on
three different animals and representative skin and heart images are shown. Brain and
kidney are shown in Supplementary Figure 2. (c) Naked mole-rat fibroblasts have low
HAase activity. Naked mole-rat skin fibroblasts (NMR SF), guinea pig skin fibroblasts (GP
SF), human skin fibroblasts (HSF), mouse skin fibroblasts (MSF) or HeLa cells were
incubated with the media containing HMW-HA for four days. The levels of HA were then
analyzed by pulse-field gel. Control samples were incubated in the absence of cells. The
experiments were repeated four times (all samples except GP), and three times for GF, error
bars show s.d.; asterisk indicates P<0.01 by t-test. (d) Naked mole-rat tissues have low
HAase activity. Media containing HMW-HA was incubated with corresponding tissue
fragments from naked mole-rats (NMR) or mice for six hours and HA levels analyzed by
pulse-field gel. The experiments were repeated three times and error bars show s.d.; asterisk
indicates P<0.05 by t-test.

Figure 3. HMW-HA is required for ECI

Author Manuscript

(a) Naked mole rat cells (NMR SF) grown in the presence of HAase do not display ECI and
proliferate to high cell density. (b) Quantification of cell growth, showing the maximum cell
number per plate achieved under indicated growth conditions. The last bar shows naked
mole-rat cells grown in the presence of CD44-blocking antibody. The experiments were
repeated four times (except the last bar, which was repeated three times) and error bars show
s.d.; asterisk indicates P<0.001 by t-test. (c) Naked mole-rat cells were grown in the
presence of HAase for 12 days, then HAase was removed. (d) Naked mole-rat cells have
higher affinity to HA. Cells were incubated with fluorescein-labeled HA, and the average
fluorescence was plotted. Experiment was repeated four times; error bars are s.e.m.; asterisk
indicates P<0.001 by t-test.

(a) Soft agar assays of anchorage-independent growth. Mouse (MSF) or naked mole-rat
(NMR SF) cells were transfected with vectors encoding SV40 LT (LT) or its mutant
derivatives K1 or Δ434 and H-Ras V12 (Ras), and plated in soft agar. Cells were cultured
with or without HAase. The image shows colonies after 3 weeks of growth at 200×
magnification. The experiment was repeated three times. (b) Mouse xenograft experiment
with naked mole-rat cells in which HMW-HA was abolished. NIH-III immunodeficient
mice were injected with mouse (MSF) cells expressing SV40LT and H-Ras V12 as a
positive control, or naked mole rat (NMR SF) cells expressing SV40LT and H-Ras V12 and
either control shRNA, Hyal2 cDNA, or shRNA to HAS2. All xenografts with mouse cells
formed large tumors. Xenografts with naked mole-rat cells expressing control shRNA did
not form tumors, while naked mole-rat cells overexpressing Hyal2 or HAS2 shRNA formed
tumors in mice. The images show xenograft sites (blue arrow) and representative tumors.
The number of xenografts resulting in tumor formation per the total number of xenografts
with each cell type is shown on the right.
