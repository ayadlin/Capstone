Abstract
Medulloblastoma comprises four molecular subgroups of which Group 3
medulloblastoma is characterized by MYC amplification and MYC overexpression.
Lymphoma cells expressing high levels of MYC are susceptible to apoptosis following
treatment with inhibitors of mitosis. One of the key regulatory kinases involved in
multiple stages of mitosis is Aurora kinase B. We hypothesized that medulloblastoma
cells that overexpress MYC would be uniquely sensitized to the apoptotic effects of
Aurora B inhibition. The specific inhibition of Aurora kinase B was achieved in MYCoverexpressing medulloblastoma cells with AZD1152-HQPA. MYC overexpression
sensitized medulloblastoma cells to cell death upon Aurora B inhibition. This process
was found to be independent of endoreplication. Using both flank and intracranial
cerebellar xenografts we demonstrate that tumors formed from MYC-overexpressing
medulloblastoma cells show a response to Aurora B inhibition including growth
impairment and apoptosis induction. Lastly, we show the distribution of AZD1152HQPA within the mouse brain and the ability to inhibit intracranial tumor growth
and prolong survival in mice bearing tumors formed from MYC-overexpressing
medulloblastoma cells. Our results suggest the potential for therapeutic application
of Aurora kinase B inhibitors in the treatment of Group 3 medulloblastoma.

INTRODUCTION

options. We have recently reported on the in-vitro proapoptotic and in-vivo cytostatic effects of Aurora B
inhibition in glioblastoma using the inhibitor AZD1152HQPA.[4] Aurora kinase B (Aurora B) is an essential
serine/threonine kinase responsible for regulation
of multiple events in mitosis including chromosome
condensation,
centromere-kinetochore
dynamics,
chromatid segregation, and cytokinesis.[5] One of the
hallmarks of Aurora kinase B inhibition is G2/M arrest
and subsequent escape into endoreplication cycles.[6]
Multiple regulatory or structural components essential to
mitotic progression have been previously targeted to block

Recent genetic analysis of medulloblastoma (MB)
has revealed four genetically and epidemiologically
distinct subgroups.[1, 2] One of these subgroups
designated as Group 3 medulloblastoma (G3MB) affects
primarily infants and children and carries an overall
survival of 45% for infants and 58% for children at five
years as reported in a retrospective international metaanalysis.[3] Given the poor clinical outcomes observed
in patients with G3MB tumors with current treatment
regimens, there is a need to explore novel therapeutic

tumor cell proliferation including microtubules,[7] cyclin
dependent kinase 1,[8] Aurora kinases,[9] and Polo-like
kinase 1.[10-12] When tumor cells overexpress c-Myc
(MYC) either endogenously or by genetic modification,
the induction of a G2/M arrest has been shown to trigger
tumor cell death in-vitro and to block tumor growth invivo.[8, 13, 14] This observation was also made recently
in B-cell and T-cell lymphoma cells overexpressing
MYC and treated with the Aurora B inhibitor AZD1152HQPA.[15, 16] MYC expression has also been reported to
confer sensitivity to radiation and DNA damaging agents
(etoposide, cisplatin) in medulloblastoma cells.[17]
Amplification of MYC, as well as MYC
overexpression, is a negative prognostic factor for overall
survival in MB.[18, 19] Approximately 11% of G3MB
tumors demonstrate MYC amplification.[20] Furthermore,
all G3MB tumors express MYC at high levels and
express genes associated with elevated MYC levels.[20]
We hypothesized that MB cells overexpressing MYC
would be uniquely sensitized to the effects of Aurora B
inhibition and that this property could be harnessed for
the in-vivo treatment of MYC-overexpressing MB tumors.
The goal of our study was not only to determine if MYC
overexpression in human MB cells sensitized the cells to
the apoptotic effects of Aurora B inhibition, but also to
further define the mechanism triggering this response. We
demonstrate that Aurora B inhibition triggers cell death
independent of DNA replication and that transient Aurora
B inhibition results in a unique impaired growth response
in MYC-overexpressing cells. Having defined the response
time-course we proceeded to optimize in-vivo therapy with
AZD-1152 HQPA, achieving a prolongation in survival
of mice bearing cerebellar xenografts of MB cells having
MYC amplification and endogenously overexpressing
MYC.

expression and Aurora B expression in G3MB (R=0.57,
P=0.002, N=27, Fig. 1C). Although WNT tumors express
high levels of AURKB mRNA we did not observe a
correlation to MYC mRNA expression in this small subset
of tumor samples (R=0.42, P=0.3, N=8). Aurora kinase
gene expression is increased in fetal cerebellum and in all
subgroups of MB compared to adult cerebellum, reflecting
the proliferative capacity of fetal and tumor tissue.
To further evaluate the expression of Aurora kinase
A and B in relation to MYC, protein expression in a
number of unsynchronized MB cell lines was evaluated
(Fig. 1D). The D425, D458 and MED8A cells, all of
which have known amplification of MYC,[18, 21, 22]
showed concurrent marked expression of both Aurora B
and MYC protein. Using a NanoString assay with a probe
set for MB subgroup signature genes,[23] the D425 cell
line was demonstrated to share a similar gene expression
signature as G3MB tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1). The
D425 cell line was derived from primary tumor tissue,[21]
whereas the D458 line was derived from cerebrospinal
fluid within the same patient after failure of radiotherapy
and chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and
vincristine.[22, 24] As such, our results suggest that the
concordance between Aurora B and MYC expression is
maintained in the setting of recurrent G3MB.

Myc overexpression sensitizes medulloblastoma
cells to cell death induced by Aurora B inhibition
The UW228 and UW426 MB cell lines show
low expression of Aurora B and MYC (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). However, the cells can be modified to stably
overexpress MYC by retroviral transduction [25, 26] â€“
the stable cell lines are identified here as UW228-Myc
and UW426-Myc. Comparison of protein expression
in MYC-overexpressing cells compared to isogenic
controls showed that increased expression of MYC was
associated with an increase in Aurora A and B protein
levels in unsynchronized cell culture (Supplementary Fig.
S2A). The cell-cycle distribution of UW228 cells did not
change with MYC overexpression while a reduction in
G1/G0 cells with associated increase in polyploid cells
was observed in UW426-Myc cells compared to control
(Supplementary Fig. S2B).
The co-expression of Aurora B and MYC in MB
cells suggested that Aurora B activity could be important
for cell survival in the presence of excess MYC, as is the
case for B-cell lymphoma cells.[15] Therefore, we tested
the ability of Aurora B inhibition to elicit cell death in
MYC overexpressing MB cells versus isogenic controls.
We selected the Aurora B inhibitor AZD1152-HQPA
for our studies as we had previously demonstrated that
it had activity in brain and flank xenografts of human
glioblastoma cells.[4] A series of drug concentrations
was used to assess the lowest concentration of drug that

medulloblastoma
MYC has been shown to directly regulate the
expression of Aurora A and indirectly the expression of
Aurora B in B-cell lymphoma.[15] Therefore, we sought
to determine if Aurora kinase gene expression correlates
with MYC expression in human MB. AURKA and AURKB
mRNA expression showed a positive correlation with MYC
mRNA expression (AURKA vs MYC: R=0.32, P=0.001,
N=103; AURKB vs MYC: R=0.37, P = 0.0001, N=103)
while no correlation exists between AURKC and MYC
expression (Fig. 1A). The highest MYC expression was
observed in WNT and G3MB relative to other subgroups,
normal fetal cerebellum, and adult cerebellum (Fig. 1B).
Furthermore, there was a modest correlation between MYC

could inhibit MB cell proliferation in UW228 and UW426
cells (Fig. 2A). Cell proliferation was inhibited in a
concentration-dependent manner both in isogenic controls
and MYC overexpressing cells (Fig. 2A). UW426 cells
showed almost complete inhibition of proliferation when
exposed to 100 nM AZD1152-HQPA for 72 hrs, while
UW426-Myc cells had cell counts that were almost half of
those at baseline, indicating that cell loss had occurred (P<
0.001, N=3). A similar effect is observed for UW228 and
UW228-Myc cells, indicating that MYC overexpression

sensitized cells to induction of cell death upon Aurora
B inhibition (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of proliferation was
achieved with 25 nM AZD1152-HQPA in UW426 and
UW426-Myc as well as UW228 and UW228-Myc
cells indicating a potent block of mitosis by Aurora
B inhibition. The 72-hour time point was selected for
determination of the concentration effects of AZD1152HQPA based on previous observations that induction of
cell death in response to Aurora B inhibition is a timedependent phenomenon.[4]

In order to demonstrate the specificity of inhibition
of MB cells at 100 nM AZD1152-HQPA, cell lysates
were probed for reduction in phosphorylation of Histone
H3 Serine 10, a specific substrate for Aurora B.[27,
28] Histone H3 Serine 10 phosphorylation is reduced
with exposure to 100 nM AZD1152-HQPA over 24
hours without a change in total Histone H3 or Î²-actin
protein levels (Fig. 2B). To further assess if AZD1152HQPA could be interacting with Aurora A, a previously
reported therapeutic target for MB,[29] we examined
the inhibition of Aurora A and B autophosphorylation.
Autophosphorylation of Aurora A on T288 and Aurora

B on T232 is a key requirement for kinase activity.[30,
31] Inhibition of Aurora B autophosphorylation without
a change in total Aurora B levels was achieved upon
exposure of control and MYC-overexpressing cells to 100
nM AZD1152-HQPA for 24 hr (Fig. 2B). We note a weak
phosphorylation signal of Aurora C (35 kDa) in UW425
and UW228 cells, which is abolished with AZD1152HQPA (Fig 2B). The autophosphorylation of Aurora A
was observed to increase slightly in both wild-type and
MYC-overexpressing cells with no change in total Aurora
A levels (Fig. 2B).
The onset of cell loss in MYC-overexpressing

MB cells compared to isogenic controls took place after
48 hours of continuous exposure to 100 nM AZD1152HQPA in our time-course experiments (Fig. 3A). This
cell loss was associated with PARP-1 cleavage indicating
the activation of apoptosis pathways [32] preferentially
in Myc overexpressing cells (Fig. 3B). While UW228
and UW426 cells showed recovery of proliferation after
release from 48 hr of Aurora B inhibition, proliferation
was impaired in UW426-Myc and UW228-Myc cells after
release, suggesting that Aurora B inhibition has unique
anti-proliferative effects on Myc overexpressing cells (Fig.
3C).

Downregulation of the serine/threonine kinase
Ark5/Nuak1 has been shown to promote cell death in
MYC expressing cells.[33] Furthermore, LATS1 levels
are regulated by Ark5/Nuak1 phosphorylation and
LATS1 is needed for activation of Aurora B.[34, 35]
In order to confirm the specificity of AZD1152-HQPA
action on Aurora B independent of Ark5/Nuak1, we
probed for changes in LATS1 levels upon continuous
medulloblastoma cell exposure to AZD1152-HQPA for up
to 96 hours. We observed that LATS1 levels are preserved
in the presence of 100 nM AZD1152-HQPA over the
first 24-48 hours. A slight reduction in LATS1 protein

is seen at 72 -96 hours in both the wild-type and Mycoverexpressing cell lines. (Supplementary Fig. S3) These
results indicate that the reduction of Aurora B kinase
activity and tumor cell polyploidy observed in the first
24-48 hours of Aurora B inhibition with AZD1152-HQPA
is independent of Ark5/Nuak1 kinase regulated LATS1
levels.
In addition to UW228-Myc and UW426-Myc cells,
we also examined effects of Aurora B inhibition in MB cell
lines with endogeneous Myc overexpression. We observed
a block in cell proliferation using an MTS assay over a
period of 96 hr in D425 and D458 cells at AZD1152HQPA concentrations between 25 nM and 1000 nM (Fig.
4A). Specific inhibition of Aurora B was also observed
in D458 and D425 cells with 100 nM AZD1152-HQPA
(Fig. 4B). These D458 and D425 cells did not show an

Aurora C phosphosignal. Aurora A and B levels remained
stable after 48 hr of Aurora B inhibitor exposure (Fig. 4B).
Also, no change in MYC protein level was observed as a
result of Aurora B inhibition (Fig. 4C). The block in cell
proliferation was associated with Caspase 3 cleavage upon
continuous exposure to 100 nM AZD1152-HQPA for 48
hr (Fig. 4D).
In addition to the demonstration of a biochemical
response that is concordant with specific Aurora B
inhibition, we observed effects on cellular morphology
and DNA content characteristic of Aurora B inhibition.
Both wild-type and MYC overexpressing cells showed
the development of a large cell, multinucleated phenotype
after 48 hr exposure to 100 nM AZD1152-HQPA
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). Cells that overexpressed
MYC had greater DNA content compared to wild-type

Cell death effect of Aurora B inhibition in
medulloblastoma does not require endoreplication

isogenic controls when cytokinesis was blocked by Aurora
B inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S5). Induction
of endoreplication was associated with an increase in
the proportion of sub-G0 (apoptotic) cells only in MYC
overexpressing cells after 48 hr of Aurora B inhibition
(Supplementary Fig. S5).

Multiple studies have suggested that endoreplication
is essential for the apoptosis response triggered by Aurora
B inhibition.[16, 36-38] If this were to be the case for
MB cells, this would limit the concurrent use of Aurora B
inhibitors along with DNA synthesis inhibitors currently
used in combination chemotherapy regimens for MB.

Therefore we sought to determine if endoreplication
was a requirement for cell loss in MYC overexpressing
medulloblastoma. In order to address this question, the
alpha-DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin [39] was
used to block DNA replication for 24 hr. If endoreplication
is a requirement for triggering apoptosis, the expected
result would be the protection of MYC overexpressing
cells from the cell death induced by Aurora B inhibition.
Incubation of medulloblastoma cells with 0.5 Î¼M
aphidicolin and 100 nM AZD1152-HQPA for 24 hr
resulted in a significant reduction in the number of cells
having > 4N DNA content (Fig. 5A). However, we did
not see a protective effect of blocking endoreplication on
cell viability in cells exposed to the Aurora B inhibitor

(Fig. 5B,C). In fact, exposure to aphidicolin for the first 24
hours resulted in lower cell viability in both UW426-Myc
and UW228-Myc cells in which Aurora B inhibition was
maintained for 72 hr (Fig. 5B). In the absence of Aurora
B inhibition, aphidicolin blocked cell proliferation. The
release from the aphidicolin block did not affect cell
viability (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, endoreplication occurred
in UW426 and UW228 cells which did not demonstrate
an apoptotic response to Aurora B inhibition (Fig. 3,
Supplementary Fig. S5). These findings are in keeping
with a DNA replication-independent trigger for apoptosis
in MYC overexpressing medulloblastoma cells when
subjected to Aurora B inhibition.

Growth of MYC medulloblastoma flank
xenografts is impaired by Aurora B inhibition

the cerebellum and subarachnoid spaces from mice that
received AZD1152-HQPA showed large multinucleated
cells on H&E histology at day 7 of therapy (Fig. 7C).
Furthermore, the proportion of phosphohistone H3
(Ser10) positive cells decreased and the proportion of
cleaved-caspase 3 positive tumor cells increased with
drug treatment (Fig. 7C,D). In addition to a reduction in
tumor growth we observed an increase in mean survival of
mice bearing intracranial D458 tumors from 18 Â± 0 days in
the vehicle treated group to 34 Â± 3 days in the AZD1152HQPA group (Log Rank P= 0.003, Fig. 7E). All of the
drug treated animals died after withdrawal of therapy. BLI
demonstrated tumor growth (5/5) and metastasis (3/5)
after cessation of drug therapy. Analysis of H&E spinal
cord sections revealed micrometastasis in 3/4 vehicle
treated mice and 4/5 AZD1152-HQPA treated mice on day
7 of treatment, suggesting that Aurora B inhibition does
not alter the propensity for metastasis in MYC amplified
medulloblastoma cells.

To test the results of Aurora B inhibition in-vivo,
we studied the drug-target effects using whole tumor
lysates probed for Histone H3 Serine 10 phosphorylation
and Aurora B autophosphorylation after administering
25 mg/kg/day of inhibitor subcutaneously for 5 days
(Fig. 6A). The cells in tissue sections from UW426-Myc
tumors exposed to AZD1152-HQPA were multinucleated
and had lost the nodular pattern of cell organization
observed in untreated tumors (Fig. 6B). The proportion of
phosphohistone H3 (Ser10) positive cells was lower in the
flank tumors from drug treated mice compared to vehicle
controls (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, the proportion of cleaved
Caspase-3 positive cells was higher in mice with UW426Myc flank tumors that were treated with AZD1152-HQPA
compared to vehicle controls (Fig. 6C). Having confirmed
target activity of AZD1152-HQPA for medulloblastoma
flank tumors, the growth rate of the tumors was studied
by measuring tumor volume. A significant reduction in
UW426-Myc tumor volume and weight at 28 days after
tumor cell implantation was achieved with subcutaneous
administration of 50 mg/kg twice daily for 2 days (Fig.
6D). This high dose, short course therapy was tested
based on the observations that at least 48 hr of Aurora B
inhibition was required to trigger cell death in UW426Myc cells.

DISCUSSION
Aurora kinase family proteins A and B have unique
functions in mitosis despite sharing a high similarity.
In this study, we have inhibited the kinase activity of
Aurora B in MB cells with both transgene mediated
and endogenous overexpression of MYC. As previously
reported AZD1152-HQPA inhibits both Aurora B
and Aurora C autophosphorylation[4] and this was
demonstrated in the UW425 and UW228 wild-type and
MYC-overexpressing cells within this study. However,
medulloblastoma cells D425 and D458 lack an Aurora C
phosphosignal suggesting that Aurora C function is not
required for mitosis in at least some medulloblastoma
cells. It is important to note that Aurora C has overlapping
function with Aurora B in mitosis.[40]
We show in this study that medulloblastoma cells
overexpressing MYC are sensitized to apoptosis induced
upon Aurora B inhibition. The induction of apoptosis in
these cells is time dependent, with cell loss occurring only
after 48 hours of continuous inhibitor exposure. While
endoreplication takes place upon Aurora B inhibition as
a result of cytokinesis block and G2/M escape and this
process is driven by MYC overexpression, we found
that inhibition of DNA replication does not protect
against cell loss. Furthermore, endoreplication occurred
in cells that did not overexpress MYC and these cells
did not show an apoptotic response. These observations
suggest that DNA synthesis inhibitors should not
affect the therapeutic effects of Aurora B inhibition in
medulloblastoma cells overexpressing MYC. This is an
important consideration since medulloblastoma is often
treated with multiple chemotherapeutic drugs, including
inhibitors of DNA synthesis such as methotrexate and
topoisomerase inhibitors.[41] A synergistic effect on
blocking cell proliferation has been shown by Aurora B

V = 190 Î¼L; C0 = 13.3 ng/Î¼L; t1/2 = 2.9 hours; AUClinear
= 68 ng â€¢ hours/Î¼L (Fig. 7A). The calculated effective
therapeutic plasma concentration time was 11 hr for
a dose of 2.5 mg (equivalent to 50 mg/kg for a 25 gm
mouse). The biodistribution of AZD1152-HQPA in the
brain was confirmed using LC/MS/MS after subcutaneous
administration of the drug in a phosphate buffered saline
solution. The peak brain content of AZD1152-HQPA
was 0.7 Â± 0.2 ng/mg brain tissue (n=4) at 2 hr after
administration.
The D458 cell line was modified to express
Luciferase by lentiviral transduction (D458-Luc/
GFP). We observed the formation of D458-Luc/GFP
tumor cell grafts in the cerebellum and monitored
growth by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) over time.
Daily administration of AZD1152-HQPA 50 mg/kg

appropriate downstream effects of Aurora B inhibition.
The orthotopic cerebellar xenograft model demonstrated
that AZD1152-HQPA can cross the blood brain barrier at
effective concentrations to inhibit tumor cell growth and
prolong survival.
AZD1152-HQPA has a clear cytostatic effect invivo, with regrowth of tumor upon withdrawal of drug
therapy. We have demonstrated that if cells are exposed to
persistent Aurora B inhibition in-vitro for at least 48 hours
that the rate of cell proliferation is reduced following drug
withdrawal. These effects are not mirrored in our in-vivo
models and may be explained by sub-therapeutic levels
of Aurora B inhibitor at the tumor site, combined with
persistence of tumor cells that are not actively cycling.
Pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that during treatment
there were periods in which the plasma concentration of
the drug was below the in-vitro therapeutic target of 100
nM. Given the significant suppression of tumor growth
with a single 48-hour period of high-dose therapy in the
UW426-Myc flank model, it is possible that sustained and
efficient tumor suppression could be achieved with a short
(48-72 hr) course of AZD1152-HQPA administered at a
dose of 50 mg/kg every 8 hours in mice. The presence of
AZD1152-HQPA in brain has been recently documented
and we also confirm this finding.[47] AZD1152 which is
the pro-drug for AZD1152-HQPA is the only selective
Aurora B inhibitor that has been assessed in phase I
and II clinical trials. In a clinical trial AZD1152 was
administered as a 1200 mg infusion over 7 days every 21
days in 32 AML patients with completion of â‰¥ 2 cycles
in 50%.[48] The geometric mean plasma half-life of
AZD1152-HQPA was 77.5 hr with steady-state plasma
concentration being 245.2 ng/mL (0.483 M).[48] Thus,
a plasma concentration greater than 100 nM, which was
the therapeutically effective concentration in our tumor
model, is achievable in humans.
Our study demonstrates that intracranial
medulloblastoma tumor growth can be impaired with
AZD1152-HQPA. These findings provide evidence to
support the investigation of Aurora B inhibitors for the
treatment of primary CNS malignancy and specifically
their use as a targeted therapeutic agent for G3M tumors.
The use of Aurora B inhibitors for the treatment of
G3M tumors may be further evaluated by examining the
effectiveness and optimal dosing of of AZD1152-HQPA in
murine models of G3M tumors such as those described by
Pei et al.[49] and Kawauchi et al.[50]

inhibition and concurrent inhibition of DNA synthesis
with Topoisomerase II inhibitor daunorubicin in human
leukemia.[42]
Contrary to our results and those of Yang et al.,[42]
retinal pigment epithelium cells overexpressing MYC
in which DNA replication is blocked by aphidicolin are
protected from induction of apoptosis by VX-680, an
inhibitor of both Aurora A and B.[16] It is important to
note that DNA synthesis was inhibited prior to Aurora
kinase inhibition in that study, which means that the cells
did not enter a 4N state. We propose that the trigger for the
apoptotic response to Aurora B inhibition is initiated prior
to endoreplication, but requires entry into G2/M. This is
in keeping with the recently reported mechanism of ATMdependent DNA damage response activated upon telomere
deprotection that results from prolongation of mitosis by
mitotic inhibitors, including Aurora kinase B inhibitor
Hesparadin.[43]
Prior reports of Aurora B inhibition in colon
carcinoma cells with ZM447439 in which post-mitotic
G1 arrest was initiated by forced expression of p21
or p27, showed that endoreplication was required for
apoptosis in these cells.[37] We did not observe apoptosis
in UW426 and UW228 cells despite the induction of
endoreplication in these cells. In order to explain this
cell-type dependent response to Aurora B inhibition and
the delayed apoptotic response to Aurora B inhibition
in UW426-Myc and UW228-Myc cells we propose
that transcriptional changes take place that are unique
to MYC-overexpressing cells and that these changes
modify the cellular response to Aurora B inhibition.
Previous groups have reported upregulation of proapoptotic genes and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic
genes with Aurora B inhibition in glioblastoma and colon
cancer cells.[44, 45] Medulloblastoma cells engineered
to overexpress MYC by retroviral transduction showed
an upregulation of ribosomal biosynthesis genes, which
is in keeping with the role of MYC as a transcriptional
amplifier driving pathways involved in RNA synthesis
and protein production.[46] The role of transcriptional
response in driving sensitization to Aurora B inhibition
and its potential for therapeutic application remains to be
addressed. Changes in the gene expression state of MYCoverexpressing cells could explain the observation that
these cells proliferate at a slower rate than untreated cells
when released from Aurora B inhibition after a period of
48 hours.
We have demonstrated the therapeutic potential
of Aurora B inhibition in MYC overexpressing
medulloblastoma in both a flank and an intracranial
xenograft model. The flank xenograft model allowed us to
assess the efficacy of AZD1152-HQPA in a location where
blood brain barrier penetration does not have a bearing on
the treatment of tumor cells. This model further facilitated
the accurate biochemical readouts that confirm AZD1152HQPA could effectively reach its target and initiate the

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Medulloblastoma cells were cultured in standard
media at 37Â°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. All cells were

confirmed to be mycoplasma negative by PCR techniques
at the Hospital for Sick Children microbiology laboratory.
Adherent cells were passaged using 0.05% Trypsin/0.53
mM EDTA. A list of all cell lines and culture media is
provided in Supplementary Methods S1.

paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 minutes.
The cell membranes were permeabilized with 0.5% v/v
Triton-X100 (Sigma) in PBS. Antigens were blocked with
1% bovine serum albumin fraction V (Merck) in PBS for
1 hr at room temperature followed by immunolabeling.
The primary and secondary antibodies used, incubation
protocol, and DNA staining and are described in
Supplementary Methods S1. An Olympus 1X81 spinning
disc confocal microscope (Olympus Canada Inc.,
Richmond Hill, ON, Canada) with Yokogawa scan head
(Yokogawa Corporation of America, Sugar Land, TX,
USA) was used to visualize the cells with 20X air or 40X
water immersion lenses (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany). Images
were processed using Volocity 5.5 imaging software.

Bioluminescent cell line
D458 cells were transfected with lentivirus carrying
an expression cassette for Luciferase and GFP (D458-Luc/
GFP) as described previously.[4]

Western blots

FACS cell cycle analysis

Cell lysates were derived by using RIPA lysis buffer
for non-phosphoproteins, or modified RIPA buffer as
described previously.[4] Lysates from flank tumors were
obtained by grinding the liquid nitrogen frozen whole
tumor with a mortar and pestle and suspending the powder
in modified RIPA lysis buffer. Proteins were separated by
SDS-PAGE on 10 to 12.5% gels and transferred to PVDF
membranes using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA). The membranes were washed in TBS-T
(100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20).
Incubation with primary antibody in TBS-T with 5%
Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma) or 5% non-fat milk was
performed at 4Â°C overnight followed by incubation with
horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody
for 1 hr and enhanced chemiluminescence detection
(Supplementary Methods S1).

Cells were grown to confluence, dissociated, and
pelleted for resuspension in 50 ÂµL of staining media (1M
HEPES (pH 7.2), 1M NaN3, 2% fetal bovine serum in
Hankâ€™s Buffered Salt Solution). The cell suspension was
gently mixed with 1 mL 80% ethanol. The cells were
centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 min at 4Â°C for pelleting and
resuspended in Hankâ€™s Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS,
Wisent Inc.) containing 2 mg/mL RNAse A (Qiagen Inc.,
Toronto, ON, Canada) for 5 minutes at room temperature.
Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in HBSS
containing 0.1 mg/mL propidium iodide and 0.6% (w/v)
NP40 at room temperature for 30 minutes. Subsequently,
the cell pellet was resuspended in 500 ÂµL of staining
media and filtered through a 100 Âµm nylon cell strainer
(BD Biosciences Discovery Labware, Bedford, MA,
USA). A total of 10,000 cells were sorted for each cell
line and experimental condition and each experiment
was performed in triplicate. An LSR II analyzer (Becton
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was used with
FACSDiva software. The excitation wavelength was 523
nm and the emission filter was LP600, BP610/20. Data
analysis was conducted with FlowJo (Tree Star Inc.,
Ashland, OR, USA). Doublets were excluded by gating
using the PI-intensity versus FSC-W graph as described
previously.[4]

Cell viability assays
Cell viability was assessed over 96 hr
using
MTS
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium) absorbance (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at
490 nm with at least 8 repeats per treatment condition per
time point in each experiment. For cell count experiments,
1 x 106 cells were cultured on a 3-cm Petri dish for 24 hr
prior to exposure to drug inhibitor and grown for a total
period of 96 hr with varying concentrations of AZD1152HQPA (Selleck Chemicals LLC, Houston, TX, USA)
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA). The final DMSO concentration was
0.01% v/v in media. The live cell number was determined
by trypan-blue exclusion using a Vi-Cell XR counter
(Beckman-Coulter, Mississauga, Ontario). Experiments
were independently repeated three times.

Xenograft tumor model
Animal experiments were approved by the Hospital
for Sick Children Animal Care Committee (protocol
1000010458) and conducted in accordance with the
Ontario Animals for Research Act and the Canadian
Council for Anima Care guidelines. Athymic nude 8-10
week old female mice Foxn1nu/Foxn1nu (Charles River,
Sherbrook, QC, Canada) were used for flank xenografts
and intracranial xenografts. Isofluorane gas anaesthetic
was used to induce an insensate state for inoculation
of cells into the subcutaneous space at the right flank.

Immunofluorescent labeling and imaging
Cells were washed with warm (37Â°C) phosphate
buffered saline (PBS, Wisent Inc.) and fixed with 4%

For implantation, 2 x 106 cells were suspended in a 1:1
mixture of PBS and Matrigel (Becton Dickinson). A total
volume of 200 ÂµL cell suspension was injected into the
subcutaneous space using a 30 Ga needle. Fourteen days
after cell inoculation palpable tumors were measured
with a digital caliper to estimate the tumor volume (in
mm3) using the formula: tumor volume = length (mm) x
width2 (mm2)/2. Animals were weighed for drug dosage
calculation and randomized to a vehicle or drug treatment
group. Subcutaneous bolus injection in the dorsal skin fold
of each animal was performed daily for 4 days. AZD1152HQPA was administered at a weight-determined volume
to achieve 25 or 50 mg/kg/day using a 2 or 4 mg per mL
of 3.94% v/v DMSO in PBS solution. The vehicle group
received a weight-determined volume of PBS with 3.94%
DMSO vehicle solution. Tumor volumes were measured
every 2 days until day 30 after implantation of tumor cells.
Animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide chamber
either at day 5 or day 30 post-implantation and tumors
excised and immediately immersed in 3.7% formaldehyde
for histologic analysis or frozen in liquid nitrogen for
protein analysis. Formalin-fixed whole tumors were
weighed prior to sectioning
Intracranial implantation of 2.5 x 105 cells suspended
in 3 ÂµL of PBS was performed using sterile technique
under isofluorane gas anaesthetic. Cells were placed into
the right cerebellum at a depth of 2.5 mm via a single
burr hole 2 mm lateral to the midline and 1 mm posterior
to the junction of the sagittal and lamdoid sutures. Mice
received 5 mg/kg ketoprofen analgesic and a bolus of
0.5 mL 0.9% saline subcutaneously in the immediate
post-operative period. At day 7, after implantation all
mice were imaged using Luciferin bioluminescence as
described previously.[4] Mice with defined posterior
fossa tumors were randomized to AZD1152-HQPA or
vehicle treatment. AZD1152-HQPA was given at a dose
of 50 mg/kg/day using a 4 mg AZD1152-HQPA per mL
of 3.94% v/v DMSO in PBS administered in the dorsal
skin fold. Treatment was continued for 21-days and
Luciferin bioluminescence imaging was repeated at 7, 15,
and 28 days after initiation of therapy. The vehicle group
received a weight-determined volume of PBS with 3.94%
v/v DMSO vehicle solution. The survival endpoints were
death, weight loss greater than 20%, inability to mobilize,
continuous seizure, moribund state. Tumors were excised
for histological analysis 7 days after initiation of drug
therapy and at the time of animal death.

after drug administration, blood was drawn by cardiac
puncture and collected in EDTA tubes. The mice were
perfused with heparinized saline (5 units heparin/mL
0.9% NaCl). Subsequently the brain was excised and
frozen in liquid nitrogen. Blood samples were centrifuged
at 800 x g for 10 min and the supernatant plasma was
frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen brain and blood samples
were submitted to the Analytical Facility for Bioactive
Molecules, The Hospital for Sick Children for liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)
analysis to determine AZD1152-HQPA concentration.
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from linear
regression analysis of Log10(plasma concentration) versus
time graph assuming a one-component model.

Immunohistochemistry
Flank tumors and whole brains were fixed and
processed for immunohistochemistry as described
previously.[4] Tissues were incubated with primary
antibody at room temperature for 1 hr. Rabbit polyclonal
anti-cleaved Caspase 3 antibody (Cell Signaling) 1:500,
and anti-phospho Histone H3 (Ser 10) (Cell Signaling)
1:200 were used. TBS-T was used for washes. Detection
was performed with avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase
complex (ABC; Vector Laboratories) followed by
diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. Nuclei were
counterstained with hematoxylin. Slides were visualized
on an Olympus 1X37 light microscope. Cells were counted
in 20X fields to greater than 1000 cells per specimen.

mRNA expression analysis in medulloblastoma
tumors
The expression profiles of medulloblastoma tumors,
cell lines, and normal samples were retrieved from GEO
accession GSE21140. The samples were expressionprofiled and assigned subgroups as previously described.
[20, 51] Pearson correlation was used to determine
the association between MYC mRNA expression and
AURKA, AURKB, and AURKC mRNA expression in
medulloblastoma tumors.

mRNA expression profiling in cell lines
Subgrouping of D283, D425, Daoy, Med 8A,
ONS-76, RES262, UW228 cells in comparison to 103
medulloblastomas was performed by NanoString analysis
for selected signature genes differentiating Wnt, SHH,
Group 3, and Group 4 tumors as previously described.[23]

Pharmacokinetic experiment and AZD1152HQPA quantification
Mice were injected subcutaneously in the dorsal
skin fold with 100 mg/kg AZD1152-HQPA using a
solution of 4 mg AZD1152-HQPA per mL of 3.94%
v/v DMSO in PBS. At 2 hr, 4 hr, 6 hr, 12 hr, and 24 hr
