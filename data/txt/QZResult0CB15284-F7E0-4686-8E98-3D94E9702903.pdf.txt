ABSTRACT
Despite numerous developed drugs based on glucose metabolism interventions
for treatment of age-related diseases such as diabetes neuropathies (DNs), DNs are
still increasing in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (T1D, T2D). We aimed to
identify novel candidates in adipose tissue (AT) and pancreas with T2D for targeting
to develop new drugs for DNs therapy.
AT-T2D displayed 15 (e.g. SYT4 up-regulated and VGF down-regulated) and
pancreas-T2D showed 10 (e.g. BAG3 up-regulated, VAV3 and APOA1 down-regulated)
highly differentially expressed genes with neuronal functions as compared to control
tissues. ELISA was blindly performed to measure proteins of 5 most differentially
expressed genes in 41 human subjects. SYT4 protein was upregulated, VAV3 and APOA1
were down-regulated, and BAG3 remained unchanged in 1- Obese and 2- Obese-T2D
without insulin, VGF protein was higher in these two groups as well as in group 3- ObeseT2D receiving insulin than 4-lean subjects. Interaction networks analysis of these 5
genes showed several metabolic pathways (e.g. lipid metabolism and insulin signaling).
Pancreas is a novel site for APOA1 synthesis. VGF is synthesized in AT and
could be considered as good diagnostic, and even prognostic, marker for ageinduced diseases obesity and T2D. This study provides new targets for rational drugs
development for the therapy of age-related DNs.

INTRODUCTION

is unknown and remains to be investigated [19, 22, 27].
Numerous studies have shown that hyperglycemia leads
to the overload of electron transport chain in mitochondria
and subsequent oxidative stress. The imbalance in the
mitochondrial redox state, in favor of oxidation conditions,
leads to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Subsequently, oxidative stress affects several
metabolic pathways [such as insulin signaling pathway
and protein kinase C (PKC) pathway; advanced glycation
end products (AGEs) and mitogen activated protein
kinase (MAPKs)] associated with glucose metabolism
with enhanced oxidative stress and, in turn, inflammatory
reactions [20, 21, 25, 28–32].
Although numerous drugs and therapies have been
proposed to treat the DNs, the majority of these drugs and
treatments were restricted to target the redox and glucose
metabolic pathways [20, 32]. None of the drugs that
targeted glucose metabolic pathways showed any efficient
effect in the treatment of DNs [19, 22]. Also, despite
identification of the genes [19] and metabolic pathways
associated with DNs, the molecular causes of DNs events
still occur in a large scale. These studies suggest that beside
hyperglycemia other genetic components and factors may
contribute to the development of DNs. For instance, tight
links between oxidative stress and obesity were recently
reported, which may provide new insight for investigation
of the genes associated with DNs [21]. Meijer et al. have
recently shown that metabolic dysfunction leads to the
adipocytes hypertrophy (the main cause of obesity),
which primes inflammation in AT [15, 16] and, in turn,
is implicated in pathophysiological states such as energy
storage disruption within adipocytes (e.g. triglycerides
breakdown, FFAs, glycerol et cetera), insulin resistance
(IR), and hyperglycemia as hallmark of T2D.
Feldman et al. reported several pathways involved
in lipid, carbohydrate and energy metabolism modulating
gene expression patterns in peripheral nerves on BKS db/
db mouse sciatic nerve. Although this study support the
hypothesis that hyperglycemia play an important role in
nerve damage, lipid metabolism may involve neuronal
damage and development of DNs as well [19]. Since both
pancreas and AT are key tissues involved in age-induced
T2D and its complications, this study was designed to
investigate whether T2D alters the expression of genes with
a function in neuronal processes in human pancreas and AT
and that might be implicated in the insurgence of DNs.

The homeostasis of blood glucose levels is
maintained by both insulin and glucagon synthesis, which
is functionally tightly regulated by the pancreatic β-cells
and α-cells respectively. When blood glucose levels rise
(hyperglycemia), pancreatic β-cells synthesize and secrete
insulin to the bloodstream to regulate glucose levels. On
the contrary, when circulating glucose levels fall below
normal values (hypoglycemia), pancreatic α -cells produce
and release glucagon to the bloodstream to tune up glucose
concentrations via conversion of stored glycogen into
glucose and its release into the circulation [1, 2]. Thus,
a disruption in blood glucose regulation leads to the
hyperglycemia state so-called diabetes. There are two
types of aged-related [3, 4] diabetes; type 1 diabetes (T1D)
and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Diminished or dysregulation of
insulin by β-cells in T1D and T2D respectively are caused
by cell aging process. T1D is an autoimmune disease
that pancreatic β-cells are targeted to be broken down by
antibodies produced by immune B cells. In this regard, the
main production site of insulin is diminished by β-cells
[5–9]. In contrast, in age-related-T2D the pancreatic β-cells
are still active and do synthesize insulin but at dysregulated
levels and not sensitive enough [10–13]. In a normal state,
there is a homeostatic balance and cross talk between
skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue (AT) organs with
respect to glucose levels, which is strictly under control
of insulin [14]. In this regard, insulin 1- promotes glucose
uptake and inhibits lipolysis by the skeletal muscle, 2stimulates glycogenesis and suppress glucose formation
and release from the liver, and 3- stimulates adipogenesis
and prevent lipolysis in AT-associated adipocytes [14]. In an
obese state, insulin shows a function completely opposite
to the normal state in these three organs. Moreover, it has
been recently shown that other cells such as adipocytes,
macrophages also synthesize insulin [15]. Patients with
either T1D or T2D diabetes are at high risk for serious
complications such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)
[16] and diabetic neuropathy (DN) [17–23]. Obesity
plays an important role in the development of T2D and its
complications via the promotion of an inflammatory state
[16]. In this regard, Systems biology could be a solution to
find etiology of aged-related diseases such as T1D, T2D,
neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases [24].
DNs are the most common micro-vascular
complications that occur in both T1 and T2 diabetes
(40–60%) [18–20, 25, 26]. DNs-associated syndromes are
classified into two groups; diffuse and focal. The former
neuropathies are usually chronic and more common among
diabetic patients, while focal neuropathies are acute [25].
In general, DNs occur in progressive damages of neuronal
cells that commonly appear with symptoms such as severe
pain, loss of sensation and disability [19, 22, 25].
Despite the general agreement that hyperglycemia
plays a key role in initiation and development of DNs,

T2D, we measured mRNA expression in human pancreas
and adipose tissue (AT) with T2D. As depicted in Table 1
and Figure 1, two genes OLIG1 and BAG3 were highly
up-regulated and eight genes PRDM16, GLDNA, APOA1,
CCKBR, EDN3, VAV3, CXCR4, and GHRL were down
regulated in pancreas with T2D as compared to pancreas
control. Based on Gene Ontology database search,
OLIG1 gene shows functions in neuron fate commitment,
neurogenesis, generation of neurons, and neuron
differentiation as shown in Figure 2. Based on database
search, BAG3 gene showed only a neural function
(i.e. neuron part). There were 24 neuron functions found
for these 10 genes in pancreas of which chemokine
C-X-C receptor (CXCR4) gene was shown to have a role
in 17 neural functions based on Gene Ontology database
(Figure 2). Among eight down-regulated genes in pancreas
with T2D, VAV3 gene was highest down-regulated gene
with approximately 246-fold (Table 1 and Figure 1).

Gene Ontology database search, 52 neural functions were
found for these 15 genes (Figure 4). Although VGF gene
was highly down-regulated, only one neural function (i.e.
neuropeptide hormone activity) was shown to be linked
with this gene (Figure 4). SYT4 gene showed a link with
5 neural functions; 1- neurological system process, 2neurotransmitter secretion, 3- neurotransmitter transport
4- neuron part and 5- neuron projection. Based on Gene
Ontology search, PTN and LRNN4 genes showed only
link with one neural function (Figure 4) and both genes
were up-regulated, while the other genes showed multiple
neural functions.
Pathway analysis
The in-silico functional analysis conducted on
the list of 25 genes, led to the identification of several
molecule-function/disease connections, as shown in
Figure 5. Focusing on SYT4, VGF, BAG3, APOA1, and
VAV3 and on their tightly related interactors, which in
turn participated to lipid metabolism, insulin, protein
kinase C (PKC), advanced glycation end (AGE) products
and MAPK signaling pathways, as well as to the electron
transport chain, oxidative stress and glucose metabolism
biological processes, we have drawn a global interaction
network (Figure 6). It contained 198 (13.8%) multiprocess genes, with 31 (AKT2, CALM1, CALM2, CALM3,
FOXA2, G6PC, HRAS, IKBKB, INSR, IRS1, MAPK1,
MAPK3, MAPK8, MLYCD, PDK4, PRKAA1, PRKACA,

INS, MAP2K1, MAPK9, PRKCA, PRKCB and NFKB1)
genes participating to 4 processes and 2 (AKT1 and

Adipose tissue (AT)
The expression of 15 genes were found to be highly
altered in AT caused by age-induced T2D (Table 2 and
Figure 3). From these 15 genes, 8 gens were highly upregulated and 7 genes highly down-regulated (Table 2,
and Figure 3). The expression of synaptotagmin-4 (SYT4)
gene were tremendously high up-regulated (approximately
392-fold) in AT-T2D as compared to AT-control, while
VGF (neurosecretory protein) is highly down-regulated
(approximately 119-fold) Table 2 and Figure 3). Another
gene, which is very highly up-regulated in AT-T2D as
compared to AT-control was MYRF (Myelin regulatory
factor) as displayed in Table 2 and Figure 3. The fold
changes of all 15 genes were reported in Table 2. Based on

difference between obese and lean group, the average of
VGF protein concentration was clearly higher in obese

involved in the development of DNs in age-related T2D.
AT is important during the insurgence of insulin resistance
in the frame of obesity and produce factors involved in
energy metabolism, such as chemokines/cytokines, and
the pancreas is implicated in insulin production. There is
little known about the genes involved in DNs in these two
organs (with or without T2D). This study was designed to
select only genes with very highly up-regulated or downregulated in AT and pancreas with age-related T2D (the
cut off was adjusted to ≥ 32 (=25) times). This selection
criterion was chosen to prevent false positive gene
differences between control and T2D in these two organs
of human.
Overall, 10 genes with a neural function were found
in pancreas-T2D of which 8 genes were highly downregulated and 2 genes highly up-regulated. Although it is
difficult from our studies to infer about the mechanism
behind each gene in the development of DNs, we assume
that these 10 genes could be potentially major players in
DNs.
One of the functions of CXCR4 is known to regulate
neuronal signaling and promotes hippocampal-neuron
survival [34–38], while the mutation affected the gene and, in
turn, suppression of CXCR4 function. Thus, down-regulation

DISCUSSION
Aging can be expressed simply as “functionality
reduction of biological process” or as “loss or reduction
of the regulated cell function”. Of note, the aging process
can be distinguished between early or premature aging and
regulated (normal) or healthy aging. Thus, all diseases such
as obesity, IR, diabetes, degenerative disease, and cancer
could be just referred to aging or aging-related diseases. The
discovery of the factors responsible for premature aging
or healthy aging will provide us information to correct
premature aging or extend healthy aging [23].
Although the underlying mechanisms for the
development of human T1D (autoimmune disease) are
completely different from T2D, insulin signaling pathway,
glucose levels, and energy storage components are
involved in both types of diabetes. Both age-induced T1D
and T2D are associated with many complications such
as DNs. We hypothesized that AT and pancreas could be

of CXCR4 function may lead to the promotion of neuronal
apoptosis. Of note, the CXCR4 was down-regulated in
pancreas-T2D. Neuronal survival and regulation of neuronal
signaling by CXCR4 might be reduced in T2D patients,
and this may play a critical role in the development of DNs.
Moreover, Based on Gene Ontology database search, 17 hits
with neuronal function were found for CXCR4.
To date, apolipoprotein A-1 (APOA1) was shown
to be synthesized in the liver and in the small intestine
and it is a major constituent protein of plasma highdensity lipoprotein (HDL). APOA1 plays a major role
in reverse cholesterol transport, as it has a high capacity
to drive cholesterol efflux [39–41]. Intriguingly, APOA1
was highly expressed in control pancreas but highly
down-regulated in pancreas-T2D. Several studies have
shown that the mutation in APOA1 is involved in the
pathogenesis of polyneuropathy [42–46]. Also, APOA1
convincingly plays a role not only in the early stage but
also in late neuropathy [42–46]. These studies support our
finding that APOA1 is highly down-regulated in pancreasT2D, and it is involved in 6 neural processes.
GHRL is also known as appetite-regulating hormone;
it is highly down-regulated in pancreas-T2D and shows 2

neural functions. GHRL has been reported to protect neurons
from damage and to improve neurons survival [47]. This may
suggest that a down-regulation of GHRL could result in a
decreased neural protection and neural survival [47].
OLIG1, also known as oligodendrocyte transcription
factor 1, is very highly up-regulated in pancreas-T2D
with four neural function hits and is involved in the
formation of oligodendrocytes and together with OLIG2
establish precursor motorneuron (pMN) of embryonic
neural tube [48]. Based on literature search, we could
only find one study related to up-regulation of OLIG1 and
disease [49]. In this study, OLIG1 was highly expressed
in oligodendrogliomas and considered as biomarker for
glial brain tumors. Thus, the up-regulation of OLIG1 in
pancreas-T2D suggests that new studies are crucial to
better elucidate OLIG1 function (s).
The major action of VAV3 (also guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF)) is in angiogenesis and it has
been recently shown that loss of VAV3 in mice on chow
diet resulted in liver steatosis and age-induced T2D [50].
Surprisingly, when the same mice were fed a high fat
diet, they showed resistance against diet-induced obesity
and metabolic syndrome [51]. However, our findings

SYT4 normalized oxytocin release, indicating that obesity
and its afflictions are under regulation of hypothalamic
neuropeptides [52, 53]. Based on our novel finding
(overexpression of SYT4 in AT-T2D) and intriguing
finding by Zhang et al. [52], we hypothesize that SYT4
can be used as a new biomarker for obesity and T2D and
may be considered as prognostic marker for age-induced
T2D, and negative regulation of SYT4 could potentially
repair or reduce the degree of DNs.
The main function of VGF (also called neuro­
endocrine regulatory peptide (NERP)) is synaptogenesis
and they are mainly present in neuron and neuroendocrine
cells [53–55]. Body fluid homeostasis was also maintained
by VGF through regulation of vasopressin release
[54, 55]. Moreover, VGF or VGF-derived peptides
increase lipolysis in AT and in turn energy consumption
in VGF deficient mice (knock-out), which are lean
[56]. However, VGF was highly down-regulated in ATT2D, which does not support the results obtained from
VGF knock-out mice [56]. These contradictory results
could be due to specific differences between mice and
humans. Based on this evidence, we speculate that the
VGF up-regulation (e.g. by an agonist) together with

in humans do not support the data collected from mice
deficient in VAV3. VAV3 showed a down-regulated of
approximately 246-fold in human pancreas with T2D
as compared to control pancreas. This finding indeed
suggests that the action of VAV3 in human is completely
different from that in mice with manipulated VAV3 gene:
the restoration of VAV3 in pancreas-T2D could contribute
to less severe DNs.
In AT-T2D, 8 genes were highly up-regulated and 7
genes down-regulated with neuronal hits. It is beyond the
scope of this study to unravel and discuss the individual
mechanism of each gene in the development of DNs. We
assume that these 15 genes could be potentially major
players in DNs. This study provides preliminary evidence
for further investigations.
SYT4 (Synaptotagmin-4) and VGF (neurosecretory
protein) genes are dramatically up-regulated and downregulated in AT-T2D, respectively. SYT4 is mainly
detectable in brain and neuroendocrine system and it has
been suggested to have a neuroendocrine role [52, 53].
These authors showed that up-regulation of SYT4 blocked
the release of oxytocin, which in turn resulted in an obese
phenotype [52, 53]. On the contrary, down-regulation of

down-regulation of SYT4 could restore the homeostatic
balance between energy consumption and energy storage
regulation, which could repair or reduce DNs.
Of note, the gene-expression data do not have enough
power without the confirmation of gene product (i.e.
protein). For this reason, five from 25 genes was selected to
measure their protein levels. SYT4 and VGF proteins were
chosen from AT-associated 15 genes, because SYT4 gene was
highest and VGF lowest expressed in AT-T2D respectively.
Although plasma VGF protein concentration in three groups
of patients did not correspond with VGF gene expression,
both plasma SYT4 and VGF protein concentrations were
increased and decreased in obese-T2D with insulin injection
as compared to without insulin injection in human subjects
respectively. The effect of insulin was also observed for
BAG3, APOA1 and VAV3 in obese-T2D with and without
insulin injection in human subjects. Based on these data,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

it is then logic to assume that insulin has an effect on the
concentrations of these five proteins and this role of insulin
could be considered as so-called “corrector’’. Importantly,
VGF gene expression did not correspond to VGF protein
levels and one reason could be that post translational
modifications (PTMs) determine VGF protein levels and
not transcriptional phase. Although we did not observe any
significant differences between three patient groups and
lean subjects with respect to SYT4, BAG3, APOA1, and
VAV3, except for VGF protein, there was a trend between
the expression of these four genes and their protein levels.
The majority of investigations and drug
developments for DNs conducted so far focused on
glucose metabolic pathways. Neuropathies still remains a
great problem in patients with diabetes. The expression of
APOA1 in control pancreas and severe down-regulation
in pancreas with T2D is very novel and important finding,

which open new avenues on lipid metabolism, HDL,
cardiovascular events, diabetes and its complications such
as neuropathies, and will help to design new future studies.
GHRL and VAV3 are also expressed in pancreas and
subjected to extreme level changes in pancreas-T2D. SYT4
and VGF were synthesized in AT and the levels alter in ATT2D dramatically. Based on this study, we conclude that
not only diabetes but also its complications such as DNs
are multifactorial diseases. Also, this study provides us a
list of most important genes affected by diabetes involved
in neuronal processes, which opens new avenues for new
investigations for drug development (using agonists or
antagonists) and new pathway(s) for the treatment of DNs.

the following steps were performed: 1: quality check;
2: background correction; 3: normalization to house­
keeping genes; and 4: utile normalization of the data using
Beadstudio Expression module v 3.2.7. After these 4 steps,
a relative mRNA intensity of 2log was considered cut-off.
Each pancreas sample was three times and AT samples
two times measured. The methods were carried out in
“accordance” with the approved guidelines.

Human subjects and plasma collection
41 human subjects divided into four groups of 10
(except lean group 11 subjects), independent of age and
gender, as follows: Group 1-Lean subjects with a body
mass index (BMI) between 20.1 and 25.6 kg/m2, Group
2- Obese subjects with a BMI greater than or equal to
30 kg/m2, Group 3- Obese subjects with T2D without
receiving insulin (obese+T2D-INS) and a BMI greater
than or equal to 30 kg/m2 30 and Group 4- Obese subjects
with T2D, receiving insulin (obese+T2D+INS) and BMI
greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2. All patients were wellselected based on their BMI. Blood was drawn from each
subject after informed consent by venipuncture into tubes
containing Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetic Acid (EDTA)
as anticoagulant. Subsequently, plasma was isolated by
centrifugation at 1500× g for 15 min at 4°C and stored at
–80°C for further analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human biopsies and gene expression procedures
Total RNA was isolated from human adult normal
visceral AT and AT-T2D. Total RNA was collected from
5 pooled human normal pancreases and one pancreas
with T2D provided by AMS Biotechnology (Amsbio,
England). The quality and concentrations of RNAs were
assessed in a Bioanalyzer (Experion), (Bio-Rad, USA/
The Netherlands) using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit
(Agilent, The Netherlands). Amplification Kit was applied
to amplify and label the RNA (Applied Biosystems,
The Netherlands). Total RNA was reverse-transcribed
into cDNA, and the concentrations were determined in
NanoDrop. RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, USA) was
used to biotinylate cRNA according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Samples were purified using the RNeasy kit
(Qiagen, The Netherlands). Hybridization to the Sentrix
Human Expression BeadChip, washing, and scanning
were performed according to the BeadStation 500 manual
(revision C). One BeadChip with 12 samples was used.
Each slide was scanned immediately. After the scanning,

96-well microtitration plates (NuncSorb) were
coated with primary antibodies (100 μl at 5 μg/ml in
PBS, 4°C). After four washes with PBS, the wells are
saturated with BSA (200 μl, 3% in PBS, at least 2 h at
RT). After four washes with PBS, 25 μl of each human
29829

serum sample were deposited in the wells and protein
were allowed to bind to their specific mAb during 3 h at
RT. All proteins not specifically bound were eliminated
by four washes with PBS. Then the HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies were added (100 μl at 1 μg/ml in
PBS, 45 min at RT). After four washes with PBS, 100 μl
of HRP substrate (TMB: 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine;
Thermo Scientific Pierce) were deposited and reaction
was allowed during 15 min in dark (upon oxidation, TMB
forms a water-soluble blue reaction product that can be
measured spectrophotometrically at 650 nm). Reaction
was then stopped by addition of 100 μl H2SO4 2 M (upon
acidification, the reaction product becomes yellow with
an absorbance peak at 450 nm). Absorbance at 450 nm
(yellow) was monitored on a plate-reader device. Primary
antibodies were purchased from SIGMA (SYT4, APOA1,
BAG3), from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (VAV3) and
Abcam (VGF). HRP-coupled secondary antibodies (antimouse, anti-goat, anti-rabbit) were purchased from Abcam.

and BAG3 for each BMI group (1- lean, 2- obese,
3- obese+T2D-INS and 4- obese+T2D+INS).
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to
identify differentially proteins concentrations of SYT4,
VGF, VAV3, apoA1, and BAG3 across the four groups as
controlling for the effects of confounding variables including
age and gender. ANCOVA analysis was done using change
of proteins concentrations in groups as dependent variable;
ordinal variable of four groups (lean, obese, obese- T2DINS, obese-T2D+INS) as a fixed effect and the effects
of confounders were controlled in analysis as covariates
(Table 3). The choice for a post-hoc analysis was due to
having five proteins profiles across four groups. All statistical
tests were two-sided and performed at a significance level of
α = 5%. Data analyses were performed using SPSS statistical
software (version 22; SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).

Interaction network-based pathway analysis
Genes belonging to lipid metabolism, insulin, protein
kinase C, advanced glycation end (AGE) products and
MAPK signaling pathways, together with those participating
to the electron transport chain, oxidative stress and glucose
metabolism biological processes were collected [57–58].
Considering that correlation of gene expression and protein
to protein interactions have been shown to cluster genes of
similar function [59], we queried UniProtKB, Mentha [60],
STRING [61] and BioGRID [62] in search of any evidence
of connection between these genes and BAG3, APOA1,
VGF, VAV3 and SYT4. Interactions were represented as
edges of graphs, while nodes denoted genes, as already
explained in [63]. Genes were colored according to the
biological processes/pathways they were participating in.
Light blue nodes represented genes that took part to
multiple processes and pathways. Differential expressions
of BAG3, APOA1, VGF, VAV3 and SYT4 genes between
normal and patient samples were evaluated by unpaired
student t-test at significance level of α = 5%. A global
view of the functional involvement of the 25 genes into
the abovementioned critical processes and pathways has
been further obtained by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
workbench. A gene-function mixed network was generated,
where edges corresponded to literature-confirmed scientific
evidences of interaction between any two genes. Dashed
edges represented indirect interactions. Green colored genes
were down-regulated in our case-study, while red genes
were up-regulated. Molecule shapes correspond to as many
kinds of molecules, as for functions or diseases (octagons
and crosses).
