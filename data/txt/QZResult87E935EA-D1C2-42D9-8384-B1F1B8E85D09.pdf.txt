ABSTRACT
In this study, a transferrin-anchored albumin nanoplatform with PEGylated
lipid bilayers (Tf-L-APVN) was developed for the targeted co-delivery of paclitaxel
and vorinostat in solid tumors. Tf-L-APVN exhibited a sequential and controlled
release profile of paclitaxel and vorinostat, with an accelerated release pattern
at acidic pH. At cellular levels, Tf-L-APVN significantly enhanced the synergistic
effects of paclitaxel and vorinostat on the proliferation of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and
HepG2 cancer cells. Vorinostat could significantly enhance the cytotoxic potential
of paclitaxel, induce marked cell apoptosis, alter cell cycle patterns, and inhibit
the migratory capacity of cancer cells. In addition, Tf-L-APVN showed prolonged
circulation in the blood and maintained an effective ratio of 1:1 (for paclitaxel
and vorinostat) throughout the study period. In HepG2 tumor-bearing mice,
Tf-L-APVN displayed excellent antitumor efficacy and the combination of paclitaxel
and vorinostat significantly inhibited the tumor growth. Taken together, dual drugloaded Tf receptor-targeted nanomedicine holds great potential in chemotherapy
of solid tumors.

INTRODUCTION

potential limitations including hypersensitivity reactions
and hematological side effects. The most important
limitation is its low colloidal stability, which results in a
poor pharmacokinetic pattern in the systemic circulation
[9]. Active drug PTX dissociates from albumin within 3–4
h of intravenous administration and possesses a Cmax value
of 13 µg/mL after 3 h, which drops to 1 µg/mL at 4 h
with a single dose of 260 mg/m2 in human patients [10].
Consequently, efforts have been made to develop novel
delivery systems, which can improve the colloidal stability
of the nanoparticle in the systemic circulation and sustain
PTX blood levels.
To this end, we propose that encapsulation of an
albumin-PTX nanoparticle (NP) within a biocompatible
lipid bilayer could, in principle, improve the biodistribution
and the pharmacokinetic profile of the albumin conjugate

Paclitaxel (PTX) is an important chemotherapeutic
drug with a broad spectrum of activity against multiple
solid tumors. PTX exhibits anticancer effects through
stabilization of microtubules, by blocking the β tubulin
subunit of the mitotic spindle through mitotic arrest [1–3].
The therapeutic efficacy of PTX is marred by its high
toxicity, poor aqueous solubility, and poor biodistribution.
Numerous therapeutic efforts have been made to
overcome the limitations of PTX; however, none of the
approaches tested have been quite satisfying [4–7]. With
this in view, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved albumin-bound PTX nanoparticles (Abraxane®)
for treatment of various cancers [8]. Although Abraxane®
showed some initial positive response, it still has many

vis-à-vis principle drug, PTX. This kind of lipid bilayersupported albumin conjugate with surface PEGylation is
expected to prolong the blood circulation that will aid the
permeation of tumor capillaries and extravasation into
tumor fenestrations via the enhanced permeation and
retention (EPR) effect [11, 12]. The therapeutic efficacy
of passively targeted NP is far from optimal [13, 14]. In
this context, present study explores the feasibility of tumor
targeting using transferrin (Tf) as a targeting ligand. The
Tf receptor (TfR) is overexpressed in cancer cells (100
fold) compared to normal cells [15–17]. Therefore, Tf
could be utilized as a suitable targeting ligand to deliver
therapeutics to TfR-overexpressing cancer cells.
Recently, combinational regimens have been
developed to decrease the adverse effects associated
with high doses of a single drug and at the same time
augment the therapeutic potential of individual drugs
by synergy [18, 19]. Meta-analyses of multicenter
clinical trials indicate that drug combination regimens
exhibit synergistic tumor response rate, higher than that
of a single agent [20, 21]. Vorinostat (VOR), a histone
deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) plays a crucial role in the
epigenetic transcriptional regulation through stabilization

of histone-DNA interactions, which induce cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells [22]. The co-loading
of VOR and PTX (from APVN, an albumin PTX/VORloaded nanoparticle) in a well-designed nanocarrier
(L-APVN) could effectively modify the pharmacokinetics
and toxicity profiles of cocktail combinations, control the
release of drugs, and maintain synergistic drug ratios for
maximum therapeutic benefits [23, 24].
We contemplated the design of lipid bilayer
encapsulation of APVN, followed by the loading of
second drug (VOR) and Tf conjugation (Figure 1). The
main objectives of the present study were to (a) improve
the colloidal stability and systemic performance of
albumin NP; (b) investigate the synergistic activity of
combinational drugs; (c) contemporaneously target solid
tumors with high specificity. For this purpose, we have
developed a custom-designed procedure in which thin
lipid-film layer was applied to the round-bottomed glass
surface, overlaid with PTX/VOR-loaded albumin NP,
and subsequently surface conjugated with Tf. Following
drug synergy investigations at an in vitro level, we have
demonstrated the therapeutic synergistic outcome in a
xenograft tumor model.

and supported with PEGylated lipid bilayer (L-APVN). The lipid bilayer-supported albumin nanocarrier was covalently conjugated with
transferrin ligand (Tf-L-APVN) to design an actively targeted delivery vehicle.

RESULTS

chemical interactions of drugs with protein or liposomal
components. The spectra of various formulations are
shown in Supplementary Figure 1B. The PTX and VOR
exhibited characteristic peaks at 2965 cm−1 (= C–H),
1707 cm−1 (C = O group), 1641 cm−1 (C–C stretch), 1370
cm−1 (CH3 bending), 1248 cm−1 (C–N stretch), 1072 cm−1
(C–O stretch), and 709 cm−1 (C–H off the plane). Since
these peaks were also present unchanged in the spectra
of liposomal formulations, likely no chemical interactions
occurred between the drugs and the carrier components.
Moreover, linkage between –COOH group of PEG and
–NH2 group of transferrin was confirmed by the amide
(–CO–NH–) stretching peak at 1634 cm−1. The signals at
1655 cm−1, 1537 cm−1, and 1396 cm−1 indicate amide-I,
II, and III bonds in albumin and transferrin, respectively.

Physicochemical characterization of transferrinconjugated lipid bilayer supported APVNs
(Tf-L-APVN)
In this study, we have formulated APVN with a mean
diameter of ~ 130 nm with a slightly negative charge. As
expected, assembly of lipid bilayer on APVN significantly
increased the particle diameter to ~ 195 nm and showed
a ζ-potential of -14.7 mV (Supplementary Table 1). The
final particle size after Tf conjugation was observed to be
~ 230 nm with good dispersity index (polydispersity index
(PDI) ~ 0.203). The amine functional groups of Tf were
covalently conjugated with the carboxylic groups of the
distal terminal PEG (DSPE-PEG) present on the external
nanoparticle surface. A coupling efficiency of ~ 78%
was observed suggesting the success of the conjugation
technique.
TEM revealed the presence of distinct, discrete,
and spherical particles, which are uniformly dispersed
in the copper grid (Figure 2A). Consistent with the DLS
analysis, particles were nanosized and showed incremental
addition upon Tf conjugation. The colloidal stability
of Tf-L-APVN in systemic circulation is one of the
foremost requirements for cancer targeting applications.
The colloidal stability of nanoparticles was evaluated by
DLS (Figure 2B). As expected, particle size of APVNs
immediately increased upon dilution by a factor of 20 due
to the aggregation or disassembly of albumin carriers. In
contrast, L-APVN and Tf-L-APVN maintained the same
particle size even when diluted in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) by a factor of 100, indicating their excellent
colloidal stability. The presence of the protective lipid
bilayer coating prevented the dissociation of albumin NPs
and improved their stability parameters in agreement with
previous reports [25].

In vitro release kinetics
The rate and kinetics of drug release from different
nanoparticulate systems were evaluated in PBS (pH 7.4)
and ABS (pH 5.0) conditions (Figure 2D). Neither of the
drugs exhibited a burst release phenomenon. A biphasic
release profile was observed for both drugs. The release
profiles of Tf-L-APVNs and other formulations were
significantly higher at acidic pH (5.0) than at physiological
pH (7.4). Importantly, a distinct and sequential release
pattern was observed for PTX and VOR, with the
latter releasing faster. For example, ~ 43% of VOR
released compared to ~ 28% of PTX from L-APVN
at 72 h. Similarly, ~ 27% and ~ 21% of VOR and PTX
were respectively released from Tf-L-APVN after 72 h
incubation in PBS.

In vitro cytotoxicity assay and synergy analysis
The cytotoxic potential of all formulations was
tested in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and HepG2 cancer
cells. At first, cytotoxicity of blank nanoparticles was
tested in these cancer cells. As shown, cell viability
remains more than 85% when treated with different
concentrations of blank NP (0.1–100 µg/ml) regardless
of cancer cells tested, indicating the non-toxic nature
of the drug delivery vehicle (Supplementary Figure
2A). Various ratiometric combinations of PTX and
VOR (5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:5) were studied to
investigate the synergistic cytotoxicity of the drugs
in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and HepG2 cancer cells
(Supplementary Figure 2). As expected, PTX/VORbased combinational regimen significantly enhanced
the cytotoxicity in all cancer cells, however, the level
of anticancer effect varied according to the ratio of the
two drugs and the nature of cancer cells. To be specific,
PTX/VOR combinations at a weight ratio of 2:1, 1:1,
and 1:2 were more effective in reducing cell viability
compared to other ratios. PTX: VOR at weight ratios
of 1:1 and 2:1 showed high synergistic activity (CI:

Solid-state characterization
The solid-state characterization was performed by
various techniques including DSC, XRD, and FTIR. The
DSC thermograms of PTX, VOR, BSA, blank liposome,
APVN, L-APVN, and Tf-L-APVN are presented in
Supplementary Figure 1A. The lack of these endothermic
transition peaks in the formulations clearly indicates the
presence of drugs in the amorphous molecular form. The
XRD patterns of all the components are presented in
Figure 2C. The free drugs exhibited numerous sharp and
intense peaks at various scattering angles (2 θ) of 10.81,
11.92, 12.90, 15.26, 16.81, 21.56, 25.089, and 42.16°
(PTX) and 16.3, 17.2, 19.2, 19.8, 22.2, and 23.7° (VOR)
implying their high crystalline nature. A complete lack
of these diffraction peaks in drug-loaded formulations
indicates the presence of drugs in the amorphous forms

0.25–0.70) while 5:1 and 1:2 ratio showed relatively low
synergistic activity (CI: 0.7–0.9). Based on the results,
it could be expected that encapsulating combinational
drugs in nanoparticulate systems will further increase
the therapeutic efficacy in cancers. Following free PTX

and VOR, APVN (1:1), L-APVN (1:1), and Tf-L-APVN
(1:1) were tested in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and HepG2
cancer cells. As hypothesized, Tf-conjugated liposomal
nanoformulations showed significantly remarkable
anticancer effects in all cancer cells tested (Figure 3A).

Intracellular uptake and targeting potential of
Tf-L-APVN

Cell apoptosis and cell cycle analysis
Annexin V/PI assay was performed to quantify
the cells undergoing apoptosis and necrosis. As shown
in Figure 4, early apoptosis (annexin-V+ and PI-) and
late apoptosis (annexin-V+ and PI+) were the major
mechanisms of cell death caused by all the formulations.
The percentage of annexin V-FITC- and PI-positive cells
significantly increased when exposed to combinational
nanoparticles, compared to single drugs. The free PTX or
VOR did not induce appreciable apoptosis of cancer cells
whereas dual drug-loaded targeted therapeutic system (TfL-APVN) exhibited significantly higher apoptotic effect,
as evidenced by ~ 45%, ~ 30%, and ~ 58% of apoptotic
cells in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 (Supplementary Figure 4)
and HepG2 cancer cells.
Cell cycle distribution patterns were investigated to
evaluate the intracellular effects preceding the cytotoxic
effect of various formulations (Figure 5). As expected,
combination of PTX and VOR remarkably increased
the proportion of cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle in
MCF-7 and HepG 2 cancer cells. A significant increase
in percentage of apoptotic cells (measured as sub-G0

In this study, the subcellular distribution was first
evaluated by flow cytometry (Figure 3B). As shown, the
mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of Tf-L-APVNs was
significantly greater (8–10 fold) than that of L-APVNs in
all cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 3A). Interestingly,
Tf-L-APVN showed a time-dependent cellular uptake
rather than short-term uptake (Supplementary Figure
3B  and 3C). MFI of Tf-L-APVNs was significantly
greater (8–10 fold) than that of L-APVNs in all cancer
cells. To further validate the receptor-mediated endocytic
uptake, competitive uptake study was performed by
Tf pre-treatment in all cancer cells. Figure 3C clearly
demonstrates the inhibition of uptake of Tf-L-APVN
in cells pretreated with native Tf, suggesting the key
role of transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis of the
nanoparticulate system. These findings indicate that the
abundant Tf receptors present in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231,
and HepG2 cancer cells could be utilized to effectively
target cancer cells and augment the therapeutic efficacy of
the encapsulated drugs.

formulations. Free PTX and VOR inhibited the migration
of MCF-7 cancer cells; however, combination regimen
of PTX/VOR was more effective. Consistently, Tf-LAPVN showed significantly higher inhibitory potential
compared to other formulations. The migration capacity
of cells treated with Tf-L-APVN was reduced 2-fold
compared to that of either PTX or VOR-treated cells
indicating that the combination of these two drugs
had significant synergistic effects on reducing tumor
progression.

Consistent with the cytotoxicity and apoptosis
analysis, Tf-L-APVN induced a marked expression of cell
cycle protein p27, and p53 in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and
HepG2 cancer cells (Figure 6B). We further monitored the
change in the expression of pro-apoptotic markers (Bax

and c-caspase-3) and the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2.
Results clearly show that the Tf-L-APVN remarkably
induced the expression of pro-apoptotic markers and
markedly decrease the expression of anti-apoptotic
markers.

is presented in Figure 7. The poor colloidal stability of
albumin conjugates resulted in the early elimination
of both the drugs from systemic circulation. The
pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed by using the
non-compartmental model (WinNonlin software). The
terminal half-life of drugs in native free form and in
albumin conjugates were in the range of 0.5–1 h, whereas
terminal half-life of drugs was increased 5-fold when
they were administered as L-APVNs and Tf-L-APVNs
formulations (5 ~ 6 h). Similarly, PEGylated nanocarriers
reduced the elimination rate constant (Kel) of drugs 8–10
fold compared to free form. Consistently, L-APVNs and
Tf-L-APVNs posted an 8–10 fold increase in the overall
AUC value of PTX and VOR, indicating that nanoparticles
significantly improved the blood circulation potential of
encapsulated drugs (p < 0.01) (Table 1).

The safety profiles of blank NPs, free drugs and
drug-loaded formulations were evaluated by a hemolysis
assay (Supplementary Figure 6). As shown, free PTX (~
25%) and free VOR (~ 40%) induced severe hemolysis
of RBC, further increased by the combination cocktail
(~ 50%). As expected, drug-induced hemolysis was
significantly reduced when the drugs were encapsulated
in nanocarriers. L-APVNs and Tf-L-APVNs in particular
showed a remarkable hemoprotective property.

decreased the body weight, indicating that PTX and VOR,
both commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs in clinic,
had great systemic toxicity. In contrast, encapsulation of
dual drugs in nanocarriers obviously reduced the declining
body weight index implying the excellent safety profile of
the formulations.
The micrographs of H&E stained tissue sections
are presented in Figure 8C. Consistent with antitumor
efficacy, Tf-L-APVNs significantly decreased the
tumor cell volume and induced remarkable changes in
tumor microstructures, such as apoptotic condensations
and fragmentation of cancer cells (Supplementary
Table 2). The mice treated with PTX, VOR, PTX/VOR,
APVNs, L-APVNs, and Tf-L-APVNs showed 30.34%,
26.31%, 48.16%, 43.93%, 58.52%, and 64.54% of
caspase-3-immunolabeled cells, respectively, while
untreated mice showed 4.26%. Similar observations
were made for PARP, which showed the highest
expression in animals treated with Tf-L-APVNs.
The number of CD31+ and Ki-67+ cancer cells was
significantly lower in the Tf-L-APVN-treated group
compared to other groups.

We have further evaluated the synergistic anticancer
effect of nanoformulations in HepG2 tumor-bearing
xenograft mice (Figure 8A). All formulations were
administered at a fixed dose of 5 mg/kg via intravenous
injections. Compared to control, free PTX and VOR
slightly inhibited tumor growth, indicating that single
drug treatment will not be effective in combating tumors.
Although the cocktail combination and APVNs delayed
the tumor growth in comparison to both free PTX and
free VOR, they could not induce complete regression
of tumors due to the poor distribution of drugs in the
systemic circulation [27]. In contrast, Tf-L-APVNs
displayed excellent antitumor efficacy compared to other
groups, demonstrating that the combination treatment of
dual drugs in nanocarriers could produce a synergistic
antitumor effect. Animal body weight changes were used
as a marker of the toxicity of anti-tumor therapeutic agents
in tumor-bearing mice (Figure 8B). Compared to control,

DISCUSSION

the drug in the blood circulation, and limit unwanted
toxicity. These characteristics would make our therapeutic
approach advantageous compared to Abraxane. With
a dual objective, to improve the systemic performance
of the albumin nanocarrier and to induce a synergistic
combinational therapeutic effect, the present study
involves developing a lipid bilayer-supported PTX and
VOR-bound albumin NP (L-APVN).
The APVN was prepared by desolvation technique in
which PTX attaches near site I interface of the subdomains
IIA and IIIA and the cleft between domains I and III with
its C13 sidechain, while VOR binds to hydrophobic
cavities present in subdomains IIA and IIIA of albumin via
hydrogen bonding [24]. We have covalently conjugated

Albumin-based nanocarrier was developed to
improve the therapeutic efficacy of PTX in solid tumors.
However, this carrier suffers from poor colloidal stability
resulting in rapid elimination of the drug from systemic
circulation. Upon intravenous administration, albumin
conjugates become unstable in a large volume of blood
and release the encapsulated PTX, which is immediately
removed from systemic circulation, limiting the possibility
of exchange of PTX between external and body albumin.
Our objectives were to improve the stability of albumin
conjugates after systemic administration using a
protective lipid bilayer coating, control the release of

Tf to the surface of lipid nanoparticles (Tf-L-APVN) via
EDC/NHS chemistry. In this study, Tf-L-APVN with a
mean diameter of ~230 nm with good dispersity index
(PDI ~ 0.203) was observed. The entrapment efficiency
of drugs was determined using HPLC. The Tf-L-APVN
showed a high entrapment efficiency of ~ 100% for PTX
and ~ 77% for VOR. The difference in the entrapment
efficiency of the two drugs was attributed to the difference
in partition coefficients that might result in the competition
between drugs to load in the carrier.
Consistent with our hypothesis, the presence of
the protective lipid bilayer effectively controlled the
release of PTX and VOR into the media. In particular,
the release rates of both drugs were significantly reduced
after the Tf conjugation to the lipid bilayer (Tf-L-APVN).
The difference observed in the release patterns of PTX
and VOR might be attributed to the disparity of the
hydrophobic nature of drugs. One of the main objectives
of the present study was to stabilize APVN using a lipid
bilayer and to control and achieve a sustained release
of the drugs. As expected, the release of the drugs was
remarkably reduced after lipid bilayer encapsulation.
Conjugation of Tf on the surface of NP further slowed
the release of drugs, possibly owing to the high molecular
mass of Tf and formation of a dense Tf layer around the
nanoparticle [25, 28].
Both anticancer drugs exhibited a typical dosedependent cytotoxic effect on sensitive (MCF 7 and
HepG2) and resistant (MDA-MB-231) cancer cells.
IC50 values were lower in sensitive cancer cells than in
resistant cells, which might be due to the overexpression
of p-gp efflux transporters. As expected, PTX/VORbased combinational regimen significantly enhanced
the cytotoxicity in all cancer cells, however, the level
of anticancer effect varied according to the ratio of the
two drugs and the nature of cancer cells. The TfR is
overexpressed in proliferating tumor cells because there
is a higher need for iron in these cells, as iron is a cofactor
in DNA synthesis [29, 30]. Using Tf-targeted NP, we
observed a sharp decrease in the IC50 values of individual
drugs compared to non-targeted NPs. Following free PTX
and VOR, APVN (1:1), L-APVN (1:1), and Tf-L-APVN
(1:1) were tested in all cancer cells. As hypothesized,
Tf-conjugated liposomal nanoformulations exhibited
remarkable anticancer effects in all cancer cell lines.
Anticancer therapies work by inducing apoptosis
in cancer cells without damaging the surrounding normal
cells. The appreciable apoptotic activity of Tf-L-APVN
was mainly attributed to the higher accumulation of
nanoparticles in the cells via Tf-receptor mediated
endocytosis uptake and the sequential release of drugs in
the intracellular environment that resulted in a synergistic
therapeutic effect [25, 28, 30]. In general, cell cycle
distribution following DNA damage is controlled by
checkpoints. PTX is known to bind to the tubulin dimer
within microtubules, and therefore exhibited a G2/M
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

phase arrest of cells, which was closely associated with the
cell growth inhibition. As expected, Tf-L-APVN exhibited
a remarkable cell cycle arrest. The untreated cells were
largely found in the G0/G1 phase, while combinational
NPs induced a significantly higher G2/M phase arrest
and appreciable amount of cells in the sub-G0 phase [31].
The migration of cancer cells plays an important role
in tumor progression and proliferation. The migration
capacity of cells treated with Tf-L-APVN was reduced
2-fold compared to that of either PTX or VOR treated
cells indicating that the combination of these two drugs
had significant synergistic effects on tumor progression.
Cellular signaling pathways were investigated
to demonstrate the molecular mechanism behind
the anticancer effect. Tf-L-APVN induced a marked
expression of cell cycle protein p27, and p53 in cancer
cells. PTX stabilizes microtubules leading to G2/M
phase cell cycle arrest (via a Raf-1 dependent pathway)
and p27 and p53 protein induction. Based on the
literature, we expected that VOR potentiates the PTX
cytotoxicity by promoting microtubule stabilization
through increase of tubulin acetylation, which disrupts
the alignment of chromosomes during mitosis and leads
to apoptosis [32, 33]. Results clearly show that the TfL-APVN remarkably induced the expression of proapoptotic markers and markedly decrease the expression
of anti-apoptotic markers. The decreased expression of
Bcl-2 protein in the present study might result in the
formation of pores in the mitochondrial membranes,
leading to proteolytic processing and activation of the
pro-caspase-9 that initiates the downstream apoptosis
cascade [34, 35].
To demonstrate the fact that nanoparticulate
encapsulation of anticancer drugs will reduce toxic effect,
we have performed the haemolytic assay. As expected,
L-APVNs and Tf-L-APVNs in particular showed a
remarkable hemoprotective property. The excellent
hemocompatibility profile of blank NPs indicates
their suitability for systemic applications [36]. The
chemotherapeutic drugs such as PTX and VOR could
transport into the RBC membrane and increase the osmotic
pressure leading to the rupture of the cell membrane and
Hb release. The presence of a protective layer around the
chemotherapeutic drugs would make entering the RBCs
impossible, leading to reduced side effects and rendering
the system safer and more hemocompatible [37].
Pharmacokinetic
study
revealed
that
nanoparticulate system improved the circulatory ability
of free drugs. Consistent with our hypothesis, lack of
colloidal stability of albumin conjugates (APVNs)
resulted in poor systemic performance for both drugs.
In contrast, L-APVNs and Tf-L-APVNs significantly
prolonged the blood circulation for PTX and VOR,
maintaining therapeutic levels of drugs throughout the
study period. It is noteworthy that the nanoformulations
maintained an effective weight ratio of 1:1 for PTX and
14935

Oncotarget

MATERIALS AND METHODS

VOR throughout the study period, a ratio for which
maximum synergistic anticancer activity was observed
in the cancer cells studied. The drugs encapsulated in
L-APVNs and Tf-L-APVNs exhibited a slow decline
in the concentrations found in the systemic circulation.
Many inferences can be drawn from these experiments.
Albumin conjugates (APVNs) disassembled in the
systemic environment whereas lipid bilayer coating
improved the in vivo performance of drugs; second,
antifouling property of PEG improved the circulatory
profile of the delivery vehicle; third, both drugs
released in a sustained and ratiometric manner (1:1)
which could further improve the therapeutic efficacy
[27, 38, 39].
In vivo anticancer efficacy study revealed that
Tf-L-APVNs could effectively control the tumor
progression demonstrating that the combination
treatment of dual drugs in nanocarriers could produce
a synergistic antitumor effect. The tumor volume of
Tf-L-APVN treated mice was 4.6-fold, 3-fold, 3.6fold and 2.4-fold smaller compared to tumor volume
of mice treated with control, free PTX, free VOR, and
cocktail PTX/VOR, respectively. Furthermore, the PTX
formulated in the non-targeted L-APVNs and targeted
Tf-L-APVNs showed significant (P < 0.05) decrease in
tumor size indicating the therapeutic advantage of Tf
conjugation, and of Tf as a targeting ligand. We believe
that the excellent antitumor effect of Tf-L-APVN can
be attributed to the tumor targeting potential of Tf that
could efficiently deliver the nanoparticles and release
the drug in the weakly acidic tumor microenvironment.
In addition, prolonged blood circulation, pHresponsiveness and size of nanoscaled carriers, and
ratiometric and synergistic effects of dual drugs all
contributed to the prominent tumor regression effect of
Tf-L-APVNs.
In summary, we have successfully developed a
transferrin-anchored robust nanoplatform for the targeted
co-delivery of PTX and VOR, in order to achieve
maximum synergistic effect in solid tumors. At cellular
levels, Tf-L-APVN significantly enhanced synergistic
effects of PTX and VOR on the proliferation of MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and HepG2 cancer cells. VOR could
significantly enhance the cytotoxic potential of PTX,
induce marked cell apoptosis, change cell cycle patterns,
and inhibit the migratory capacity of sensitive and
resistant cancer cells. In addition, L-APVNs and Tf-LAPVNs demonstrated prolonged circulation in the blood
and maintained an effective weight ratio of 1:1 (for PTX
and VOR) throughout the study period. In HepG2 tumorbearing mice, Tf-L-APVN displayed excellent antitumor
efficacy and significantly inhibited tumor growth.
Taken together, these results indicate that PTX/VORcombination drug-based TfR-targeted nanomedicine
holds great potential in cancer chemotherapy of solid
tumors.

Materials
Vorinostat was purchased from LC Laboratories
(MA, USA). Paclitaxel was obtained from Shaanxi Top
Pharm Chemical Co. Ltd (Xi’an, China). Bovine serum
albumin (BSA; MW = 66 000 kDa), holo-transferin (Tf),
and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3
phosphoethanolamine-N-[carboxy(polyethylene-glycol)2000] (DSPE-PEG2000), and cholesterol were purchased
from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA). TfAlexa488 and Lysotracker red were purchased from
Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). All other
chemicals were of reagent grade and were used as supplied.

Preparation of the APVNs, L-APVNs and
Tf-L-APVNs
The paclitaxel (PTX) and vorinostat (VOR)entangled albumin nanoparticles (APVNs) were prepared
by desolvation [46, 47]. Briefly, PTX and VOR (250 µg/
mL each) in ethanol were added drop by drop to 1 mL
(1 mg/mL) of albumin solution maintained at pH 9. The
albumin-drug mixture was probe sonicated for 15 min
and kept aside. Separately, a thin film of the lipid mixture
was prepared by adding POPC (2.6 µM), cholesterol (5.17
µM), DSPE-PEG2000 (0.36 µM) and DSPE-PEG-COOH
(0.7 µM) and removing the chloroform using a rotary
evaporator. Later, the thin film was hydrated with the APVN
solution for 3 h with the final lipid concentration of 10
mM. The albumin-lipid suspension was extruded 11 times
through a stack of two polycarbonate membranes with 200
nm pores using an Avanti Mini Extruder (Avanti Polar
Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) resulting in the encapsulation
of APVN in the lipid bilayer (L-APVN). Afterwards,
transferrin (Tf) was conjugated to L-APVNs (Tf-LAPVNs). The amine functionalities of holo-transferrin
(Tf) were used to conjugate DSPE-PEG-COOH by EDC/
NHS-based carbodiimide chemistry. Briefly, to stirred 1 mL
of the lipid formulation equivalent amounts of EDC and
NHS (0.25 M) were added and allowed to incubate for 15
min at room temperature. Next, 125 µg of Tf in PBS (pH
7.4) was added and the mixture was incubated overnight.
The unbound protein was separated from liposomes by
ultracentrifugation at 12000 rpm for 30 min. The coupling
efficiency was further determined by BCA protein assay
and was calculated as µg Tf/µmol PL (Phopholipid).

Morphological characterization
The nanoparticle morphology was examined using a
transmission electron microscope (TEM; H7600, Hitachi,
14936

Oncotarget

Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV.
A drop of the NP dispersion was placed onto a copper
grid coated with a carbon film, negatively stained with
phosphotungstic acid (2%, w/v), and viewed under TEM.
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was also performed
using Nanoscope IIIa scanning probe microscope (Digital
Instruments, Murray Hill, NJ, USA).

serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

Cytotoxicity assay and synergy analysis
The cytotoxicity potential and synergy analysis of
VOR and PTX was tested in MCF 7, MDA-MB-231 and
HepG2 cancer cells. Cells (1 × 105) were seeded in 96-well
plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The next day, the
cells were exposed to various concentrations of PTX and
VOR (individually). Also, cells were co-treated with the
combination of drugs at a weight ratio of 5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2
and 1:5 (PTX:VOR). Furthermore, the cells were treated
with free PTX, free VOR, PTX:VOR (PV), APVNs,
L-APVNs, and Tf-L-APVNs at various concentrations
(0.001 – 10 µM) and incubated for 24 h. After 24 h, cell
viability was assessed by MTT assay (Sigma–Aldrich).
MTT reagent (100 µL; 1.25 mg/mL) was added to each
well and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the dark. The cells
were then lysed and formazan crystals were dissolved by
the addition of 100 µL of DMSO. The absorbance was
measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Multiskan
EX, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and the
combination ratio was evaluated using Calcusyn software
(Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).

Physicochemical characterization
The hydrodynamic size, polydispersity index (PDI),
and ζ-potential were analyzed by dynamic light scattering
(Nano ZS 90, ZetaSizer; Malvern Instruments, Malvern,
UK). The NPs were suitably diluted with distilled water
and measured at 25°C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of the samples were recorded using a vertical
goniometer and X-ray diffractometer (X’Pert PRO MPD
diffractometer, Almelo, The Netherlands) measuring Nifiltered CuK-radiation (voltage, 40 kV; current, 30 mA)
scattered in the crystalline regions of the sample.

Drug encapsulation efficiency
The encapsulation efficiency and drug loading of the
NP formulations were determined using Agilent 1200 series
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after
ultrafiltration using an Amicon® centrifugal filter device
(molecular weight cutoff 10 000 Da; EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA). The supernatant was injected onto
a C18 column (Inertsil® ODS3: 0.5 μm, 15 cm × 0.46 cm,
GL Sciences Inc., Japan) using a gradient mobile phase
comprised of acetonitrile and water with 0.1% formic acid
(35:65 (VOR) and 60:40 (PTX), v/v) mobile phase with a
flow rate of 1.0 mL/min (Supplementary Figure 1C). The
eluent was analyzed using a UV-Vis detector at 227 nm for
PTX and 241 nm for VOR, respectively.

Cellular uptake analysis
Briefly, cells (3 × 105) from each cancer cell line
were seeded in a 6-well plate and incubated for 24 h.
The cells were then incubated with rhodamine-B loaded
L-APVN and Alexa488-labelled Tf-L-APVN for various
time intervals (0.5, 1, and 3 h) at 37°C. Cells were washed
twice with PBS, detached using 0.25% trypsin/EDTA,
centrifuged twice at 1500 rpm for 3 min, and the pellet was
resuspended in 1 mL of PBS. The suspended cells were
directly introduced into a FACS (fluorescence activated
cell sorting (flow cytometer)) from BD FACS Calibur TM
(USA) and analyzed with FL 1 and FL 2 channels. For
confocal imaging, Alexa488 labeled Tf-L-APVNs were
incubated in cancer cells for 1 h, washed two times with
ice-cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min),
and washed twice with PBS. The cells were pre-treated
with excess free Tf 30 min before treatment to observe
the competitive uptake of the Tf-L-APVNs into the cell.
Finally, coverslips that contained cells were mounted
onto slides and observed using confocal laser scanning
microscopy (CLSM, Nikon A1+, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

In vitro release
The release of PTX and VOR from APVNs, L-APVNs
and Tf-L-APVNs was evaluated in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.14 M NaCl), and acetate-buffered
saline (ABS, pH 5.0, 0.14 M NaCl) using membrane tubing
(Spectra/Por®; 3500 Da cutoff, CA, USA). 1% Tween 80
were added to increase the drug solubility in a medium. The
dialysis was performed at 37 °C, at 100 rpm. The samples
were collected at predetermined times and replaced with
equal amounts of fresh buffer. The concentrations of PTX
and VOR present in the dialysate were quantified by HPLC
using Agilent HPLC as described above.

to administer the intravenous injection. The injection
volume of different formulations was 0.3 mL (5 mg/kg)
per animal. Blood samples (0.15 mL) were withdrawn
at predetermined intervals (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
12, and 24 h) and immediately centrifuged (Eppendorf,
Hauppauge, NY, USA) at 13000 rpm for 10 min. The
plasma supernatants were stored at –20 °C until further
analysis. The samples for HPLC analysis were prepared
as following; 150 µl of thawed plasma was mixed with
150 µl of methanol and vortex-mixed for 30 min. The
mixture was centrifuged, supernatant was evaporated,
the samples were reconstituted in the mobile phase and
20 µl was injected into the HPLC system. The HPLC
conditions were as discussed in the in vitro studies section.
The plasma concentration–time values were modeled by
non-compartmental analysis using WinNonlin software
(professional edition, version 2.1; Pharsight Corporation,
Mountain View, CA, USA). The pharmacokinetic
parameters analyzed included the elimination rate (Kel),
half-life (t1/2), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time
of Cmax (Tmax), mean retention time (MRT), and area under
the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC).

Cell migration assay
The scratch assay was performed to assess the
effect of free PTX, VOR, PV, APVNs, L-APVNs, and
Tf-L-APVNs on cancer cell migration. Cells (1 × 104)
were seeded in a 96-well plate and grown for 24 h. The
cells were treated with respective drug formulations
(0.1µg/ mL) for another 24 h. Cell monolayers were
physically wounded by scratching the surface with a
wound maker. Images of cells invading the scratch were
captured after 16 h using the IncuCyte ZOOMTM (Ann
Arbor, Michigan, USA). The pictures were evaluated
by measuring the width of the wound with the IncuCyte
ZOOMTM analysis software and the migration rate
was expressed as a percentage of the scratch closure as
follows:% of scratch closure = ((a – b)/a) × 100, where
a is a distance between edges of the wound and b is the
distance that remained cell-free during would closure.

In vivo antitumor study
HepG2 cell-bearing xenograft mice models were
developed by subcutaneously injecting 1 × 107 cells/100
µl into the rear flanks of 5-week-old male BALB/c nude
mice (Orient Ltd. Osan, South Korea). After two weeks of
initial implantation, animals were randomly divided into
six groups (n = 6 per group). Respective formulations were
injected at a dose of 100 µg/100 µL in 750 µg carrier by tail
vein four times every 3 days. Tumors were measured twice
weekly using a digital caliper and the tumor volume (V) was
calculated as, V = ((width)2 x length)/2. The animals were
sacrificed after four weeks of treatment and the primary tumor
was excised, weighed, and subjected to further analysis.

Immunoblot analysis
The cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 and
treated with respective formulations. The cells were then
lysed on ice for 60 min in RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific,
MA, USA). The whole-cell lysates were subjected to
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were
blocked with 5% skim milk, and subsequently incubated
with the specific primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution)
overnight at 4°C. After incubation with secondary antibodies,
proteins were detected using chemiluminesecence detection
reagents. Films were developed using a Kodak imaging film
(Kodak, USA) processor.

Histopathological analysis
Xenografted tumor masses were cut and fixed in
10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin,
serially sectioned (3–4 μm), and stained with H&E prior
to histopathological examinations under a light microscope
(Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The tumor cell volumes and intact
tumor cell-occupied regions (%/mm2 of tumor mass) were
calculated using a computer-based automated image analyzer
(iSolution FL ver 9.1, IMT i-solution Inc., Quebec, Canada).

overnight at 4ºC in a humidity chamber, and then incubated
with biotinylated universal secondary antibodies and ABC
reagents for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, sections were
reacted with the peroxidase substrate kit for 3 min at room
temperature. Cells were counted as immunopositive if they had
> 20% immunoreactivity to the apoptotic marker (caspase-3
