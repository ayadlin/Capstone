ABSTRACT:
The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) facilitates the
appropriate folding of various oncogenic proteins and is necessary for the survival
of some cancer cells. HSP90 is therefore an attractive drug target, but the efficacy of
HSP90 inhibitor may be limited by HSP90 inhibition induced feedback mechanisms.
Through pooled RNA interference screens, we identified that heat shock factor 1(HSF1)
is a sensitizer of HSP90 inhibitor. A striking combinational effect was observed when
HSF1 knockdown plus with HSP90 inhibitors treatment in various cancer cell lines
and tumor mouse models. Interestingly, HSF1 is highly expressed in hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) patient samples and HCC is sensitive to combinational treatment,
indicating a potential indication for the combinational treatment. To understand the
mechanism of the combinational effect, we identified that a HSF1-target gene DEDD2
is involved in attenuating the effect of HSP90 inhibitors. Thus, the transcriptional
activities of HSF1 induced by HSP90 inhibitors provide a feedback mechanism of
limiting the HSP90 inhibitor’s activity, and targeting HSF1 may provide a new avenue
to enhance HSP90 inhibitors activity in human cancers.

INTRODUCTION

[2, 10, 11]. Therefore, HSP90 is considered as a synthetic
lethal target [12-14].
After the first HSP90 inhibitor, 17-AAG
(tanespimycin), entered clinical trials in 1999, thirteen
different HSP90 inhibitors are currently undergoing
clinical evaluation in cancer patients in twenty-three active
oncology trials [15]. Each of these inhibitors disrupts
HSP90 activity by replacing ATP in the N-terminal
nucleotide-binding pocket [11, 15]. NVP-AUY922 and
NVP-HSP990 are novel, non-geldanamycin-derivative
HSP90 inhibitors [16]. Both compounds showed
significant antitumor activity in a wide range of mutated
and wild-type cancer cell lines, primary tumor cells and
animal models of cancer, including melanoma, myeloma,
gastric cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer(NSCLC),
hepatocellular cancer, sarcoma, and breast cancer
[16-19]. Progress has also been made in terms of

Molecular chaperones assist in the folding of
nascent polypeptides and the correct assembly or
disassembly of protein complexes [1, 2]. A majority of
chaperones are the so-called heat-shock proteins (HSPs),
which are expressed in response to increased temperature
or a variety of other cellular stresses. Among them, heat
shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a conserved molecular
chaperone and is involved in stabilizing and activating
more than 200 proteins[2]. Since many HSP90 ‘clients’ are
known oncogenic proteins, such as tyrosine kinases[3-5],
steroid hormone receptors[6], AKT[7], HIF1α[8] and
MMP2[9], that are known to sustain cancer cell growth,
differentiation and survival. HSP90 chaperone machinery
enables mutated oncoproteins to escape from misfolding
and degradation and allows for malignant transformation

RESULTS

identifying sensitive cancer indications and effective
drug combinations: in HER2+ breast cancer, HSP90
inhibitors block HER2 signaling and suppress tumor
growth as the stability of HER2 protein is dependent on
HSP90. In a Phase II clinical trial following combination
of trastuzumab with 17-AAG treatment, a response rate
of 24% was reported and clinical benefit was observed in
more than 57% of evaluated patients[2, 20].
Although significant progress has been made and
promising results have been seen in breast cancer patients
receiving HSP90 inhibitor treatment, HSP90 inhibitor was
also shown to lack efficacy in certain cancer types, such
as melanoma. In a Phase II trial of 17-AAG in patients
with metastatic melanoma, no objective anti-melanoma
responses were observed [21]. Therefore, understanding
the resistant mechanisms of cancer cells in response to
HSP90 inhibition will help us to develop the effective
combinational therapy with HSP90 inhibitor.
To identify the genetic modulators of HSP90
inhibition, we performed pooled shRNA screening to
search the potential combinational targets of HSP90
inhibitor, and identified HSF1 as a sensitizer of HSP90
inhibitor. HSF1 is a conserved transcription factor and
a major regulator of the heat shock response [22, 23].
Beyond heat shock response, HSF1 also regulates a
transcriptional program highly specific to malignant cell
including cell cycle, cell signaling, metabolism, adhesion
and translation [23-25]. Recently, eliminating HSF1 was
showed to protect mice from tumors induced by mutation
of the RAS oncogene or a hot spot mutation in tumor
suppressor p53 and from DEN-induced hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) formation [24, 26]. Loss of tumor
suppressor NF1 activates HSF1 to promote carcinogenesis
through dysregulated MAPK signaling [27]. Moreover,
HSF1 knock-out or knock-down cells were shown to be
more sensitive to HSP90 inhibitor [28-31]. Those studies
indicate that HSF1 may play an important role in tumor
initiation, development and maintenance, and contribute to
cell sensitivity to HSP90 inhibitor. However, the functional
role of HSF1 in human cancer cell resistance to HSP90
inhibitors and the mechanisms underlying the combination
effect of HSF1 knockdown and HSP90 inhibitors are not
fully understood. Moreover, the downstream targets of
HSF1 which may play a role in attenuating the effect of
HSP90 inhibitor are not fully appreciated.
In this study, we observed that HSF1 knockdown
combined with HSP90 inhibitors led to striking inhibitory
effects on cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor
growth in vivo. HSF1 knockdown combined with HSP90
inhibition facilitates the degradation of oncogenic proteins,
induces cancer cell apoptosis, and decreases activity of
the ERK pathway. HSF1 expression is significantly upregulated in HCC, suggesting a tumor type that may be
targeted by combinational treatment. Finally, we identify
DEDD2 as a HSF1 target gene involved in the resistance
to HSP90 inhibition.

Pooled shRNA screening reveals that HSF1 as a
top sensitizer to HSP90 inhibitor
To identify genes that modulate the efficacy of
HSP90 inhibition on tumor cell growth, we performed
a large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) genetic screen
with a collection of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors
targeting 1,000 human genes in A375 (Fig. 1A). A
barcoding technique was used to identify genes whose
suppression caused resistance or sensitivity to two
separate concentrations of NVP-AUY922 (Fig. 1B). 163
and 360 shRNA constructs were significantly depleted
form either low- or high-dose NVP-AUY922 treated
samples (FDR<=0.15). Among those shRNA hits, 84
hits (including 81 genes) were common shRNA hits as
shown in Venn diagram (Fig. 1C) and sensitizing genes
or rescuing genes were also shown (Z score≥3, or Z
score≤-3, Supplementary Table. S1). Among of these
shRNA hits, HSF1 and heat shock protein 90 alpha,
class B member 1(HSP90AB1) knockdown scored as the
most top sensitizers to HSP90 inhibition in A375 cells,
and are known to regulate the cell response to heat shock
conditions (Fig. 1D), which may reflect the potential
feedback mechanism of HSP90 inhibition. Taking
together, HSF1 is identified as a sensitizer of HSP90
inhibitor through pooled shRNA screening.

HSF1 knockdown sensitizes cancer cells to HSP90
inhibitor in vitro and in vivo
To validate whether HSF1 was indeed a sensitizer of
HSP90 inhibition, two HSF1 inducible shRNA constructs
by targeting distinct HSF1 sequence were stably
introduced into different cancer cell lines: A375, A2058
and HCT116. When shRNA expression was induced by
Doxycycline, robust HSF1 knockdown was achieved in all
three cancer cell lines (Fig. 2A). We next tested whether
HSF1 knockdown has a combinational effect with NVPAUY922 or NVP-HSP990. Induction of HSF1 shRNA
(but not the NTC shRNA) led to IC50 of NVP-HSP990
shifting from 19nM to 6nM in A375 cell, 12.7nM to
5.2nM in A2058 cell (Fig. 2B). The combination effect
was even more dramatically observed in extended
colony formation assays (Fig. 2C). In HCT116 cells,
HSF1 knockdown led to a significant shift of LD50 of
either NVP-HSP990 or NVP-AUY922 (more than 6 fold
change) (Fig. 2D). To further validate HSF1 as a sensitizer
of HSP90 inhibitor, the combinational effect of HSF1
knockdown with HSP90 inhibitor was tested in A375
xenograft mouse model. HSF1 shRNA alone inhibited
tumor growth by 53% T/C, and knockdown was confirmed
(Fig. 2E and F). NVP-HSP990 alone at tolerated dosage
817

(10mg/kg PO, qw) inhibited tumor growth by 0.01% T/C
(Fig. 2F). More strikingly, HSF1 knockdown & NVPHSP990 combination led to 76% tumor regression (Fig.
2F). HSP70 level induced by HSP90 inhibition was also
significantly reduced upon HSF1 knockdown (Fig. 2E).
These results suggest that HSF1 is critical for limiting the
efficacy of HSP90 inhibitor in human cancer cells both in
vitro and in vivo.

in HCC patients, immunohistochemistry (IHC) study for
HSF1 was performed on primary human HCC samples
and non-neoplastic liver samples and the HSF1 antibody
was validated by using Hep3B cell pellets with inducible
HSF1 shRNAs. HSF1 staining was significantly decreased
in Hep3B cells treated with Doxycycline in comparison
with cells without Doxycycline treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S2). HSF1 staining was then scored in 50 human HCC
tumor samples. Samples that were not immunoreactive
(Ki67 negative) or had insufficient tumor were excluded
from the analysis. HSF1 expression was not observed in
non-neoplastic human hepatocytes of the 45 HCC tumor
samples were evaluable, 35 HCC cases showed positive
HSF1 staining (Fig. 3B and Table 2). The intensity of
staining varied considerably from tumor to tumor. These
results suggest that both mRNA and protein level of HSF1
expression are increased in HCC.
Next, we tested whether HSF1 knockdown could
inhibit the proliferation of HCC and whether there is a
combinational effect of HSF1 knockdown and HSP90
inhibitor in HCC cells. Indeed, both the cell proliferation
and colony formation assay showed that HSF1 knockdown
inhibited the growth of HCC in vitro (Fig. 3C and D). In

inhibition
To identify the cancer type which may be useful
for the stratification of the combinational treatment,
we examined HSF1 expression in TCGA database and
found that HSF1 is over-expressed in several tumor
types (Supplementary Figure S1). Among them, we are
particularly interested in HCC since HSF1 has been
reported to be a key modulator of HCC development
in mouse model [26]. HSF1 mRNA was significantly
elevated in HCC tumor in compared to normal control
(Fig. 3A). To examine the protein expression of HSF1

endogenous HSF1 and HSP70 expression was decreased
by Doxycycline treatment (Fig. 3E). HSF1R cDNA
expression rescued both growth phenotype medicated by
HSF1 knockdown (Fig. 3F) and the combinational effects
caused by HSF1 knockdown and HSP90 inhibition (Fig.
3G), which indicate that the effects of the HSF1 shRNA
constructs are indeed on-target effects. The effect of HSF1
knockdown on the proliferation of tumor cells was also
tested in Hep3B xenograft mouse model. HSF1 shRNA

addition, HSF1 knockdown sensitized both Hep3B and
Huh7 cells to HSP90 inhibitor at different levels in vitro
(Table 1). To evaluate whether the phenotype mediated
by HSF1 shRNA knockdown and the combination
effect mediated by HSF1 shRNA knockdown and
HSP90 inhibition was on-target, RNAi-resistant HSF1
(“HSF1R”) cDNA was expressed in Hep3B cells with
inducible HSF1 knockdown. HSF1R cDNA restored the
expression of HSF1 and HSP70 in Hep3B cell lines when

decreased level of HSP70, p-ERK and increased level of
cleaved PARP were also observed in melanoma cells (Fig.
4B) and hepatocellular cancer cells (Supplementary Fig.
S3). To understand how HSF1 knockdown affects the cell
proliferation under HSP90 inhibitor treatment, cell cycle
analysis was performed. HSF1 knockdown didn’t affect
the percentage of cancer cells in cell cycle while HSP90
inhibitor caused more cancer cells into S+G2M phase
(data not shown). In contrast, the percentage of cancer
cells in the S+G2M phase was significantly decreased
in HSF1 knockdown group than in the control group
under HSP90 inhibitor treatment(Fig. 4C), indicating that
under HSP90 inhibition the knockdown of HSF1 blocks
cancer cells to enter the cell cycle, thereby decrease the
proliferation of cancer cells. Next, we examined whether
HSF1 knockdown may enhance apoptosis of cancer cells
under HSP90 inhibitor treatment by staining the cells
with 7AAD and Annexin V. Similarly, HSF1 knockdown
didn’t affect the apoptosis of cancer cells while HSP90
inhibitor induced the apoptosis of cancer cells (data
not shown). HSF1 knockdown further enhanced the
apoptotic proportion of cancer cells under HSP90 inhibitor
treatment (Fig. 4D). Thus, the combination treatment of
HSF1 knockdown and HSP90 inhibition facilitates the
degradation of HSP90 client proteins, such as BRAF and
HER2, inhibits MAPK growth signaling and results in cell
cycles arrest and cell apoptosis.

(Fig. 3I). However, HSF1 knockdown & NVP-HSP990
combination reduced the HSP90 inhibitor induced cell
stress response and led to tumor stasis (Fig. 3H and I).

DEDD2 is a HSF1-target gene involved in
attenuation of the effect of HSP90 inhibitor

Combination of HSF1 knockdown and HSP90
inhibition leads to a decreased level of p-ERK and
an increase of cell apoptosis

Previous studies suggest that HSP70/HSC70
knockdown has a combinational effect with HSP90
inhibitor, which might partially account for certain extend
of the combinational effect of HSF1 knockdown with
HSP90 inhibitor [32]. To identify additional HSF1-target
genes, we compared the gene profiles in A375 cells with or
without HSF1 knockdown treated or untreated with HSP90
inhibitor. Several genes are up-regulated by HSP90
inhibitor treatment and this upregulation are diminished by
HSF1 knockdown (Fig. 5A). Most of those genes belong to
well-known HSF1-regulated cell stress pathway, such as:
HSPA1L, HSPA1A, HSPA6, HSPB1, HSPA4C and DNAJR1
(Fig. 5A). Among these top hits, apart from heat-shock
pathway genes regulated by HSF1, BAG3 and DEDD2
are involved in cell death [33, 34]. Previously, BAG3 was
identified as a HSF1 target gene and DEDD2 was defined
as one of genes included in the molecular signature in
response to the HSP90 inhibitor [35-37]. BAG3, a member
of the Bcl-2-associated athanogen family, was reported
as a mediator of a novel macroautophagy pathway that
uses the specificity of HSP70 to misfolded proteins [33].
DEDD2 associates with DEDD and is involved in the
regulation of nuclear events mediated by the extrinsic
apoptosis pathway [37]. DEDD2 might be an important

To understand the mechanism of the combination
effects of HSF1 knockdown and HSP90 inhibition, we
tested: 1) whether HSF1 knockdown may facilitate the
degradation of HSP90 client protein by HSP90 inhibition,
such as BRAF or HER2 oncogenic proteins; 2) whether
HSP90 inhibition may enhance the attenuation of MAPK
signaling mediated by HSF1 knockdown as recent finding
suggests that HSF1 deficiency attenuates MAPK signaling
in mice[27] and 3) HSF1 may regulate other target genes
rather than HSP70, which may play a role in attenuating
the effect of HSP90 inhibition. Therefore, we examined
the status of HSP90 client proteins and the downstream
effects in cell treated with either HSF1 shRNA or HSP90
inhibitor or combination of HSF1 shRNA and HSP90
inhibitor. HCT116 cells were treated with different doses
of NVP-HSP990 and HSF1 knockdown in combination
with NVP-HSP990 (5nM) reduced the HSP70, p-ERK and
HER2 levels significantly while NVP-HSP990 or HSF1
knockdown alone did not(Fig. 4A). HSF1 knockdown in
combination with NVP-HSP990 (25nM) led increased
cleaved PARP (Fig. 4A). The combination also led an
enhanced degradation of BRAF in A375 cells (Fig. 4B). A

mediator for death receptors and target caspases to the
nucleus [34]. However, the functional roles of BAG3 and
DEDD2 in cancer cell response to HSP90 inhibition are
not explored. Therefore, we decided to further validate
whether BAG3 and DEDD2 may play a role in the
combinational effect mediated by HSF1 knockdown and
HSP90 inhibition. Like HSP70, both BAG3 and DEDD2
mRNA expression were increased upon HSP90 inhibition,
which were abolished upon HSF1 knockdown (Fig. 5B and
Supplement Fig. S4). DEDD2 protein expression was not
significantly regulated by HSP90 inhibition, but its basal
level was decreased upon HSF1 knockdown (Fig.5C).
In comparison, HSP70 protein level was significantly
increased by HSP90 inhibition, which was abolished
by HSF1 knockdown (Fig.5C). Furthermore, DEDD2
expression was elevated by over-expression of HSF1 (Fig.
5D). ChIP experiment also showed that HSF1 is bound to
DEDD2 promoter in response to HSP90 inhibition (Fig.
5E). These results suggest that DEDD2 is a direct target
gene of HSF1. DEDD2 knockdown alone mildly enhances
effect of HSP90 inhibitor (Fig. 5F). In comparison, BAG3

knockdown did not affect the activity of HSP90 inhibitor
(Supplement Fig. S5). Taking consideration of the possible
redundancy function of DEDD and DEDD2, knockdown
of both DEDD and DEDD2 was performed by using
siRNA in the combinational experiment and a significant
combinational effect with HSP90 inhibitor was observed
(Fig. 5F). Thus, these results suggest that DEDD2 is
involved in compensation mechanism of HSP90 inhibitor.

DISCUSSION
Under heat shock condition, HSF1 monomers
dissociate from HSP90, undergo trimerization, nuclear
translocation and subsequently upregulate expression of
heat shock proteins, including HSP70 and HSP27 [32].
The inhibition of HSP90 also increases HSF1 trimer
stability and prolongs the heat shock response [38].
Previously, studies suggest that HSF1 transcriptional
activity is upregulated by HSP90 inhibition, which
may limit the efficacy of HSP90 inhibitors through the
activation of heat-shock responsive genes including

HSP27 and HSP70 [32]. However, the functional role of
HSF1 itself in response to HSP90 inhibition is not fully
appreciated. We found that knockdown of HSF1 sensitizes
cancer cells to HSP90 inhibitors in many different
cancer lineages, including melanoma (A375, A2058),
hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep3B, Huh7) and colon
cancer (HCT116). More importantly, the combination of
HSF1 knockdown with HSP90 inhibition prevents tumor
growth significantly in xenograft mouse model (stasis or
regression). We also observed that the combined treatment
with HSF1 shRNA and HSP90 inhibitor leads to reduction
of HSP90 inhibitor-induced HSP70 expression and p-ERK
signal and induction of cleaved PARP.
Targeting HSF1 in combination with HSP90
inhibitor in HCC is particularly interesting because HSF1
expression level, both in mRNA and protein, is remarkable
higher in primary HCC sample than normal hepatocytes.
HSF1 knockout mice are viable and healthy, suggesting
that inhibition of HSF1 might not be toxic to normal
tissues [24]. Apart from combination with potential HSF1
inhibition, HSP90 inhibitor was also proposed to combine
with mTOR inhibitor since blocking HSP90 may disrupt
rapamycin-induced activation of alternative signaling

pathways in HCCs and substantially improve the growthinhibitory effects of mTOR inhibition in vivo [39]. HCC is
an aggressive human cancer and current therapies are not
very effective. HSP90 inhibitor in combination with HSF1
inhibitor or mTOR inhibitor may provide an additional
therapeutic strategy for HCC.
The question is how to drug HSF1 as a transcription
factor. A promising approach to target HSF1 is to use
therapeutic siRNA to knockdown HSF1. Although
a significant progress has been made in developing
siRNA therapy, there are still many hurdles to overcome
[31]. Many efforts have also been put into drugging the
HSF1 pathway. A couple of small compounds have been
identified to have the ability to inhibit heat shock-induced
upregulation of HSP and other HSF1 targets in cells, such
as quercetin and KNK437[40]. In particular, the antimalaria drug quinacrine (QC) was showed to prevent
heat shock response in cancer cells and suppresses HSF1
induced HSP70 expression in a relatively selective manner
[41]. In future, developing the potent and selective HSF1
pathway inhibitors might eventually be useful for treating
human cancer in combination with HSP90 inhibitor or
other agents.

We also compared the gene profile between
melanoma cells treated with HSP90 inhibitor with or
without HSF1 knockdown. As expected, most genes
regulated by HSF1 in response to HSP90 inhibitors are
related to heat shock response. Some of them, such as
HSP70, have been shown to have a combinational effect
with HSP90 inhibitor previously [32]. DEDD2 is upregulated by HSP90 inhibition and this up-regulation is
reversed by HSF1 knockdown. Interestingly, only DEDD2
is regulated by HSF1 while DEDD is not regulated by
HSF1 under HSP90 inhibitor treatment (data not shown).
Knockdown of both DEDD2 and DEDD, but not either
alone, enhances HSP90 inhibitor efficacy, suggesting the
redundancy function of these proteins.
In this study, we identified that HSF1 transcriptional
activities are induced by HSP90 inhibitors, which may
provide a resistance mechanism through up-regulating a
protective “heat shock” response and other transcriptional
targets, such as DEDD2. However, a couple of questions
still remain to be answered: 1) Are there any other
transcriptional targets regulated by HSF1 required for
HSF1-mediated resistance to HSP90 inhibitor in different
settings? 2) Are there any co-regulators whose activities
are required for HSF1-mediated resistance to HSP90
inhibitor? These questions will further prompt us to
initiate large-scale screens to directly identify the HSF1key-targets in different settings and HSF1-cofactors that
are important for HSF1 transcriptional activities induced
by HSP90 inhibitors in future. While a subset of HSF1dependent-targets may play important roles in attenuating
the efficacy of HSP90 inhibitors, the newly identified
HSF1-target genes and/or HSF1-cofactors will not only
help us to understand how HSF1 transcriptional function
is regulated but may also reveal novel therapeutic targets
in combination with HSP90 inhibitors.

reader (Perkin Elmer). Luminescence values were used to
calculate the inhibition of cell viability relative to DMSOtreated cells (0% inhibition) to calculate. Half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) and median lethal dosage
(LD50) were further calculated.

Pooled shRNA screening
pLKO.1 lentiviral plasmids encoding shRNAs
targeting the kinases and apoptosis related genes were
obtained and combined to generate a plasmid pool as
well as control shRNAs designed not to target any gene.
These plasmid pools were used to generate lentiviruscontaining supernatants as described23. For screening,
A375 cells were infected with the pooled virus so as to
ensure that each cell contained only one viral integrant.
Cells were selected for 3 days with 1μg/ml puromycin.
After selection, 6x106 cells were collected as Day0
sample. 6x106 cells were further cultured and treated
with or without NVP-AUY922 (10 or 20nM) for 14
days. Genomic DNA was isolated from cells by DNA
extraction in Qiagen DNA blood and Tissue kit. To
amplify the shRNAs encoded in the genomic DNA, PCR
was performed for 33 cycles at an annealing temperature
of 66 °C using 2-6 μg of genomic DNA, the primer pair
indicated below, and DNA polymerase. Forward primer:

of shRNA was obtained by addition of 100ng/mL
Doxycycline (Clontech) to the medium.

Western blotting was performed as follows:
total tumor lysates were separated by SDS/PAGE and
electrotransferredto nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen).
Membraneswere blocked in PBS and 0.1% (vol/vol)
Tween-20 (PBS-T) and 4% (wt/vol) nonfat dry milk (BioRad) for 1 h on a shaker at room temperature. Primary
antibodies were added to the blocking solution at 1:1,000
(HSF1; Cell signaling, 4356), 1:1,000 (HSP70; Cell
signaling, 4876), 1:1,000(DEDD2 ; Abcam, ab104350),
1:1,000(p-ERK; Cell signaling, 4370), 1:1,000(ERK; Cell

1:1,000(BRAF; Cell signaling, 9433), 1:1,000(cleaved
PARP; Cell signaling, 5625), and 1:10,000 (GAPDH;
Cell Signaling Technology, 2118S) dilutions and incubated
overnight and a rocker at 4 °C. Immunoblottings were
washed three times, 5 min each with PBS-T, and
secondary antibody was added at 1:10,000 dilution into
PBS-T milk for 1 h on a shaker at room temperature. After
several washes, enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
reactions were performed according to manufacturer’s
recommendations (SuperSignal West Dura Extended
Duration Substrate; Thermo Scientific).

RNA Extraction and Quantitative Reverse
Transcription-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasyMini kit
(Qiagen). ABI taqman gene expression assays include
HSP70 and DEDD2. VICMGB primers/probe sets
(Applied Biosystems) were used in each reaction to
coamplify the B2M transcripts. All experiments were
performed in triplicate and normalize to B2M levels as
indicated.

Immunohistochemistry
A tissue microarray containing hepatocellular
carcinoma samples with Hepatitis B-positive patients
(50 cases, 2 cores per case) and two non-neoplastic
liver samples (2 cores per sample) was purchased from
AccuMax (A217). Primary antibodies were Ki67 antibody,
Ki67_2 (Vector Laboratories Rabbit, VP-RM04), rabbit
IgG isotype control (Southern Biotech, 0111-01) and HSF1
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Rabbit, 4356) were
used. Secondary antibody incubation was done with either
Ventana OmniMap or Ventana UltraMap prediluted HRPconjugated multimer anti-rabbit secondary antibodies
(Cat # 760-4315). Immunohistochemical staining was
performed on the Ventana Discovery System. Images were
captured using Aperio Scanscope.

Tumor xenografts
Mice were maintained and handled in accordance
with Novartis Biomedical Research Animal Care and Use
Committee protocols and regulations. A375 and Hep3B
cells engineered with Tet-inducible shRNA against HSF1
were cultured in DMEM and EMEM supplemented with
10% Tet-approved FBS. Mice (6–8 weeks old, n=8) were
inoculated s.c. with 5 × 106 A375 cells or 7 × 106 Hep3B
cells in the right dorsal axillary region. Tumor volume was
measured by calipering in two dimensions and calculated
as (length × width) / 2. Drug treatment started 6 days
(A375) or 19 days (Hep3B) after implant when average
tumor volume was around 200 mm3. Animals received
vehicle (5% dextrose, 10 ml/kg, orally, qw), Doxycycline
(25mg/kg, orally, qd) or NVP-HSP990 (10 mg/kg, orally,
qw) for the duration of the study. At termination of the
study, tumor tissues were excised and snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen for immunoblotting analyses of biomarkers. Data
were expressed as mean ± SEM, and differences were
considered statistically significant at P < 0.05 by Student
t test.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay
ChIP assay was carried out according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (chromatin immunoprecipitation
assay kit, catalog no. 17-295, Upstate Biotechnology Inc,
Lake Placid, NY). Immune complexes were prepared
using anti-HSF1 (Cell Signaling, 4356) antibody. The
supernatant of immunoprecipitation reaction carried
out in the absence of antibody served as the total
input DNA control. PCR was carried out with 10 μl
of each sample using the following primers: DEDD2
promoter, 5′-GAGTCACGGGCAGGAAGTAG-3′ and
5′-ATTATTACGCCTGCGTCACC-3 ′. This was followed
by analysis on 2% agarose gels.

Gene Profiling

Patient tumor sample analysis

RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy mini
kit. Generation of labeled cDNA and hybridization to
HG-U133 Plus2 arrays (Affymetrix) were performed as
previously described [42]. DNA microarray results have
