Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive neoplasm with almost
uniform lethality and a 5-year survival rate of 7%. Several
overexpressed mucins that impede drug delivery to pancreatic
tumors have been therapeutically targeted, but enzymes
involved in mucin biosynthesis have yet to be preclinically
evaluated as potential targets. We used survival data from
human patients with pancreatic cancer, next-generation
sequencing of genetically engineered Kras-driven mouse pancreatic tumors and human pancreatic cancer cells to identify the
novel core mucin-synthesizing enzyme GCNT3 (core 2 b-1,6
N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase). In mouse pancreatic cancer
tumors, GCNT3 upregulation (103-fold; P < 0.0001) was
correlated with increased expression of mucins (5 to 87-fold;
P < 0.04–0.0003). Aberrant GCNT3 expression was also associated with increased mucin production, aggressive tumorigen-

esis, and reduced patient survival, and CRISPR-mediated
knockout of GCNT3 in pancreatic cancer cells reduced proliferation and spheroid formation. Using in silico small molecular
docking simulation approaches, we identiﬁed talniﬂumate as a
novel inhibitor that selectively binds to GCNT3. In particular,
docking predictions suggested that three notable hydrogen
bonds between talniﬂumate and GCNT3 contribute to a docking afﬁnity of 8.3 kcal/mol. Furthermore, talniﬂumate alone
and in combination with low-dose geﬁtinib reduced GCNT3
expression, leading to the disrupted production of mucins in
vivo and in vitro. Collectively, our ﬁndings suggest that targeting
mucin biosynthesis through GCNT3 may improve drug responsiveness, warranting further development and investigation in
preclinical models of pancreatic tumorigenesis. Cancer Res; 76(7);

Introduction

due in part to altered expressions of mucins, which form a mesh
that makes target sites inaccessible to drugs (2–9). Clinical and
preclinical studies have shown aberrant expression of mucins
during pancreatic cancer development. The mucins may prevent
drugs from accessing their sites of action. The expression of several
mucins, including MUC1, MUC4, MUC5AC, and MUC16, is
highly upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC),
pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), intrapapillary
mucinous neoplasms, and mucinous cystic neoplasms from
patients with pancreatic cancer (2–18). The extent to which the
dense mucin mesh inﬂuences the antiproliferative activity of
5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) was investigated using human pancreatic
cancer cells (2, 3). These studies have led to increasing recognition
of mucins as potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets
in pancreatic cancer. However, there are no reports evaluating the
mucin-synthesizing genes as potential therapeutic targets.
Over 95% of human pancreatic cancers are associated with Kras
mutations. Activation of the Kras and EGFR signaling pathways is
involved in increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis,
and decreased apoptosis. Clinical studies also suggest a correlation between overexpression of mucins and pancreatic cancers
(10–13). One important issue is whether synthesis of mucins by
core enzymes is regulated coordinately. We have shown that
p48Cre/þ-LSL-KrasG12D/þ genetically engineered mice (GEM) with
Kras mutations display signiﬁcant dysregulation of EGFR and
upregulation of mucin biosynthesis in PanIN lesions (19). We
have observed that inhibition of PDAC with the EGFR inhibitor

Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease, and its management is an
ongoing challenge. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of
deaths due to cancer in the United States (1). It is a highly
aggressive cancer that is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage
and has the worst prognosis of any malignancy, with a 7% 5-year
survival rate due to high chemoresistance. This chemoresistance is

geﬁtinib is associated with suppression of mucin synthesis in
p48Cre/þ-LSL-KrasG12D/þ GEM (19). Although EGFR inhibitors
(geﬁtinib) are effective, higher doses lead to signiﬁcant skin
toxicity. Hence, new approaches to target mucin synthesis are
urgently needed to improve the efﬁcacy of existing drugs or to
design new drugs. Although several mucins, like Muc1 and Muc5,
have been targeted, we have little knowledge about potential
intervention approaches involving mucin-synthesizing genes.
The mucin-synthesizing core 2 b-1,6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GCNT3/C2GNT) plays a signiﬁcant role in mucin
biosynthesis. Aberrant GCNT3 expression leads to overexpression
of mucins (17, 18, 20). GCNT3 activity plays important roles in
physiologic processes, including inﬂammatory and immune
responses. Thus, GCNT3 is an attractive novel target for pancreatic
cancer treatment (17–18, 20–21). To date, nearly all reports on
pancreatic cancer mucins have focused on mucin peptide gene
expression or on aspects of the glycosylated mucins, with relatively few reports addressing the enzymes that catalyze mucin
biosynthesis.
In this article, using human pancreatic cancer tissues, GEM
tissues, transcriptome analysis, in silico experiments, Clustered
Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR),
spheroid assay, and in vitro and in vivo studies, we identiﬁed
GCNT3 as a novel target for pancreatic cancer intervention. Then,
we determined that talniﬂumate effectively binds to GCNT3 with
low binding energy. Finally, we found that talniﬂumate decreased
GCNT3 expression alone or in combination with geﬁtinib in vitro
and in vivo.

previously published method (19). Mucin staining was performed per our earlier publication (19).
Mouse model, diet, and handling
All animal research was performed under the auspices of
animal protocols approved by the University of Oklahoma
Health Sciences Center (OUHSC, Oklahoma City, OK) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were housed in
ventilated cages under standardized conditions (21 C, 60%
humidity, 12-hour light/12-dark cycle, 20 air changes/hour) in
the university rodent barrier facility. Semipuriﬁed modiﬁed AIN76A diet ingredients were purchased from Bioserv, Inc. Generation of p48Cre/þ-LSL-KrasG12D/þ mice expressing the activated
KrasG12D oncogene has been described previously (22–27). The
EGFR inhibitor geﬁtinib was procured from the center for cancer
prevention and drug development drug repository. Mice were
allowed ad libitum access to the respective diets and to automated
tap water puriﬁed by reverse osmosis.
Breeding and genotyping analysis
LSL-KrasG12D/þ and p48Cre/þ mice were maintained on a
C57BL/6 heterozygous genetic background. LSL-KrasG12D/þ and
p48cre/þ mice were bred, and offspring of activated p48Cre/þ.-LSLKrasG12D/þ and C5BL/6 wild-type mice were generated at the
required quantities as previously described (22–27).

Cell lines and reagents
Human pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa, BxPC-3, and
PANC-1) were obtained from the ATCC. The cell lines were
authenticated by short-tandem repeat analysis by the ATCC. Cell
lines were initially expanded and cryopreserved within 1 month
of receipt and were typically used for 3 months, and at that time, a
fresh vial of cryopreserved cells was used (2011–2015). These cells
were maintained in culture as an adherent monolayer in RPMI
1640 medium or DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Antibodies for GCNT3, Muc4, Muc13, PCNA, cyclin D1, and actin were
purchased from Abcam, Novus, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Tissue processing and histologic analysis of PanIN lesions and
PDAC
After euthanizing the mice, pancreata and other key organs,
including liver, spleen, kidney, and lung, were collected and
weighed. Tissues were ﬁxed in 10% formalin for 24 hours and
were routinely processed and embedded in parafﬁn. Formalinﬁxed 4-mm tissue sections from each pancreas were stained with
hematoxylin & eosin and were histologically evaluated by a
pathologist blinded to the experimental groups. PanIN lesions
and carcinoma were classiﬁed according to histopathologic criteria, as recommended elsewhere (19, 22–27). To quantify the
progression of PanIN lesions, the total number of ductal lesions
and their grades were determined (19, 22–27). Similarly, pancreatic carcinoma and normal-appearing pancreatic tissue were
evaluated in all animals.

Patient specimens
A human pancreatic cancer tissue array (HPan-Ade180Sur-01),
consisting of 90 cases of tumor and matched normal adjacent
tissue (1 core/case) with survival data, was procured from US
Biomax, Inc. The tumors were categorized as clinical stages I, II,
and IV (seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on
Cancer criteria). Survival information was available; patients were
followed for 3 to 7 years. Patients' history of smoking, drinking,
diabetes, hepatitis B information, and family medical history
were recorded. In addition, we used OD-CT-DgPan03-001 PDAC
(62 cases; US Biomax, Inc.). These PDACs (1 core/case) were
pathology grade 1, 1–2, 2, and 2–3. Ninety percent of cases had
tumor–node–metastasis detail information. Further, we used
patient tissue slides from our Stephenson Cancer Center core.

Transcriptome analysis/next-generation sequencing/RNA-seq,
and data analyses
Pancreatic tumor tissues and normal pancreas were collected
from at least 6 10-month-old Kras mice and 6 10-month-old
wild-type mice. Pancreatic tumor tissues were also collected
from at least 3 untreated control mice and 3 geﬁtinib-treated
mice, after 25 weeks of treatment. Total RNA was extracted
with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) and subjected to cDNA
library construction, followed by next-generation sequencing
(NGS), per the NGS protocol, with a Solid or Illumina
sequencer in the OUHSC core facility (Microgen). The
sequence data were deposited to the Geospiza/Perkin Elmer
company server and analyzed with GeneSifter bioinformatics
software.

IHC analysis
The parafﬁn-embedded tissue microarrays and GEM tissue
slides were used for IHC staining of GCNT3, following our

agreement with those reported in the literature (28, 29). 1HNMR spectroscopy was performed on a Varian Mercury VX-300
NMR Spectrometer at the NMR Facility (University of Oklahoma). High-resolution electrospray mass (ES-HRMS) spectral
analysis was performed at the OUHSC Molecular BiologyProteomics Facility using a Qstar Elite Q-TOF (Applied Biosystems) mass spectrometer. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) solvents consisted of water containing 0.1%
triﬂuoroacetic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile containing
0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid (solvent B). A Sonoma C18 (ES
Industries, 10 mm, 100 Å, 4.6  250 mm) column was used
with a ﬂow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The HPLC gradient system
began with an initial solvent composition of 95% A and 5% B
for 2 minutes, followed by a linear gradient to 5% A and 95% B
in 30 minutes, after which the column was reequilibrated. The
absorption detector was set at 254 nm.
In silico molecular docking studies
Talniﬂumate was obtained from NCBI's Pubchem database
(Pubchem CID 48229). The crystal structure for GCNT3 was
downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDBID 2GAM).
Chain A and the reference ligand, GALB1,3GALNAC, were separated from the pdb ﬁle into two separate ﬁles for docking, and all
water molecules were removed. Using AutoDockTools, nonpolar
hydrogens and partial charges were added to the receptor GCNT3,
and to the ligands GALB1,3GALNAC and talniﬂumate. For ﬂexible ligand docking, rotatable bonds were deﬁned for both
GALB1,3GALNAC and talniﬂumate, with a total of 12 and 6
rotatable bonds, respectively. To accomplish a blind docking
simulation, six search grids were created with AutoGrid4 to
surround the entire protein with the following grid center coordinates: (84.029, 5.002, 65.752), (51.029, 5.002, 65.752),
(67.529, 11.498, 65.752), (67.529, 21.502, 65.752), (67.529,
5.002, 68.752), (67.529, 5.002, 62.752). Each grid was set to
126  126  126 points with a spacing of 0.35 Å. The Lamarckian
search algorithm was used to dock the ligands in all six energy

grids. The GA population size was increased to 500, energy
evaluations to 25,000,000, number of generations to
10,000,000, and the number of runs to 500. Other default search
parameters were unchanged. All docking results were concatenated and sorted by binding free energies to identify the conformation with the lowest binding free energy. Figures were created
using Pymol.
MTT assay, Western immunoblotting, and real-time PCR
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay for viability, Western immunoblotting, and real-time
PCR techniques were used to analyze the expression of GCNT3,
Muc1, Muc13, Muc4, Muc5ac, PCNA, and cyclin D1.
CRISPR knockout for GCNT3 and spheroid assay
CRISPR/Cas9 KO plasmid transfection. In a 6-well tissue culture
plate, 1.5  105 to 2.5  105 cells were seeded in 3 mL of
antibiotic-free standard growth medium per well, 24 hours prior
to transfection. Cells were grown to 40% to 80% conﬂuency.
Healthy and subconﬂuent cells are used for successful human
GCNT3 CRISPR/Cas9 KO Plasmid transfection (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as per the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation, successful transfection of CRISPR/Cas9 KO Plasmid was
visually conﬁrmed by detection of the GFP via ﬂuorescent microscopy. Cell viability was determined using the MTT method.
Spheroid assay. The AlgiMatrix 3D Culture System (Life Technologies) was used for multicellular tumor spheroid assays,
following the vendor's instructions. After GCNT3 transfection,
untransfected and transfected cells were trypsinized and resuspended (1  106 cells/mL) in standard cell culture medium.
Then, 10% (v/v) AlgiMatrix Firming Buffer was added to this
suspension. An AlgiMatrix 3D Culture System plate was inoculated with the suspension, which was added to the top of each
dry sponge with a pipette. Approximately 5 minutes after

to the top of each sponge, without ﬁrming buffer, and were
incubated at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.
Culture medium was changed based on cell proliferation or
when the medium began to change color. Spheroid formation
was monitored for 3 weeks, and the number and size of
spheroids were recorded.

Statistical analysis
Survival time was compared between men and women and
between high and low expressions of GCNT3 using the logrank test. Survival rates across time by gender and by GCNT3
expression were estimated and plotted using the Kaplan–Meier
method. The other data are presented as mean  SE. Differences in body weights were analyzed using ANOVA. Statistical
differences between control and treated groups were evaluated
using the Fisher exact test for PDAC incidence. Unpaired t test
with the Welch correction was used for PanIN and PDAC
lesions. Differences between groups were considered signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.

Results
Correlation between GCNT3 expression and patient survival in
human pancreatic cancer
To determine the association between GCNT3 expression
and patient survival, we performed an IHC analysis for GCNT3
expression on a tissue microarray containing 180 specimens
from individuals with pancreatic cancer (90) or matched
controls (90). The median age was 62 years, and 36.1% of
patients were female. Based on the seventh edition of the
American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria, there were 4
stage IA, 35 stage IB, 13 stage IIA, 33 stage IIB, and 2 stage IV
tumors. Pathologically, the tumors were adenocarcinoma,
ductal adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous carcinoma. There were 51.3% poorly differentiated tumors and 48.63% well-to-moderately differentiated
tumors. All tumors that were tested for GCNT3 expression
were evaluated by an independent pathologist.
There were 88 patients (32 females, 56 males) with pancreatic
cancer in the study. The median follow-up time was 12 months.
Fifty-nine patients died during the study. Women had a

marginally nonsigniﬁcant longer survival time than men (median
survival: 30 vs. 12 months, P ¼ 0.053; Supplementary Fig. S1A). A
5.5% staining score as a cutoff point was used to determine low
GCNT3 (5.5%) versus high GCNT3 (>5.5%) expression.
Patients with low expression of GCNT3 had a longer survival
time than patients with high expression of GCNT3 (median
survival: 17.5 vs. 10.5 months, P ¼ 0.036; Fig. 1A). In patients
with high expression of GCNT3, there was no signiﬁcant difference in survival time between women and men (median survival:
17 vs. 10, P ¼ 0.2894; Supplementary Fig. S1B). Importantly,
those patients with history of smoking, drinking, or diabetes
comprised 62.9% of the sample with high GCNT3. These data
indicate that GCNT3 may be an important prognostic factor for
patients with pancreatic cancer. Further, after analyzing additional
samples (total 103 pancreatic cancer samples) for the percent
positive cells stained for GCNT3, 24.2% (25/103) of male patients
with PDAC showed >50% GCNT3 expression, 27.18% (28/103)
showed 5% to 50% GCNT3 expression, and 48.54% (50/103)
patients showed <5% GCNT3 expression. In female patients with

PDAC, 20.9% (9/43) showed >50% GCNT3 expression, 30.23%
(13/43) showed 5% to 50% GCNT3 expression, and 48.83%
(21/43) showed <5% GCNT3 expression (Fig. 1B). Similarly,
high expression of GCNT3 was observed in human PanINs
(Fig. 1C). Figure 1D shows the expression of GCNT3 and mucin
in PanINs and PDAC.
Pancreatic cancer progression in GEM
Over the past few years, we have demonstrated the utility of the
p48Cre/þ-LSL-KrasG12D/þ (Kras) mouse model for testing the
efﬁcacy of pancreatic cancer chemopreventive agents (19, 22–
27). In this study, we used pancreata from 10-month-old Kras and
wild-type mice (N ¼ 6/group). A signiﬁcant increase in pancreas
weight was observed in Kras mice compared with wild-type mice
(Fig. 2A). As summarized in Fig. 2B, the Kras mice developed
PanIN lesions (mean  SEM; PanIN1: 190  28, PanIN2: 172 
23, PanIN3: 160  18), whereas no evidence of PanIN lesions was
observed in wild-type mice. Out of 6 Kras mice, 4 mice (66%)
showed carcinoma incidence, with 32.5% carcinoma spread

were free from PanIN lesions and PDAC, whereas 100% of
pancreata were normal in wild-type mice.
Gene expression proﬁling in pancreatic tumor tissues by
next-generation transcriptome analysis
We next collected the pancreata and determined GCNT3
expression using PCR. We observed that tumors showed significantly increased GCNT3 compared with normal pancreas.
GCNT3 mRNA levels are signiﬁcantly higher in the pancreatic
tumors of GEM compared with normal pancreas (Fig. 2C). We
then determined GCNT3, EGFR, and top hits related to mucin
expression using transcriptome analysis (Fig. 2D and E). We
observed a signiﬁcant increase in the GCNT3 (103.16-folds;
P < 0.0001) in correlation with increased mucins Muc4 (50-fold;
P < 0.04), Muc5ac (87-fold; P < 0.01), Muc6 (67-fold; P < 0.008),
Muc 1 (5-fold; P < 0.009), Muc 16 (5-fold; P < 0.0003), and Muc

pancreatic tumors from 10-month-old mice compared with pancreata from wild-type mice, as determined by NGS/RNAseq
analysis (Fig. 2E). Further, IHC and mucin staining revealed high
expression of GCNT3 and mucins in PanIN lesions and PDAC
(Fig. 2F). Importantly, the GCNT3 expression in the pancreatic
tissue was observed to increase progressively as the GEM age

We synthesized talniﬂumate for our studies using the following
method (Fig. 3A; refs. 28, 29). Quality and purity were determined
using NMR, HRMS, and HPLC (Fig. 3B–D). Using bioinformatics
tools, the binding conﬁrmation of the noncompetitive inhibitor
talniﬂumate (Fig. 4A) to GCNT3 was explored using in silico small
molecular docking simulations. Our blind docking simulations
revealed that talniﬂumate binds to GCNT3 with a better afﬁnity

1970 Cancer Res; 76(7) April 1, 2016

than does the reference ligand GALB1,3GALNAC. Although talniﬂumate is positioned in the same pocket of GCNT3 that GALB1,
3GALNAC occupies, they do not occupy the same exact space
(data not shown). Talniﬂumate's best docking afﬁnity of 8.3
kcal/mol is achieved deeper in the pocket of GCNT3, whereas
GALB1,3GALNAC's best docking afﬁnity of 7.51 kcal/mol is
achieved closer to the surface of GCNT3. The docking predictions suggest three notable hydrogen bonds between talniﬂumate and GCNT3: Arg192 (3.0 Å), Try288 (3.5 Å), and Ala287
(2.9 Å). Although side chain hydrogen bond contacts are
suggested between both the hydrophilic residues, Arg192 and
Tyr288, the docking suggests a main chain hydrogen bond
contact between talniﬂumate and the hydrophobic Ala287
(Fig. 4B–D). One drawback with performing rigid receptor
docking simulations is that the side chains do not adjust to
the docked ligand, which could explain the longer hydrogen
bonds between talniﬂumate and both Arg192 and Tyr288. In
vivo, these side chains could move closer to the ligand, shortening the hydrogen bond and, therefore, making this a stronger
interaction.
Talniﬂumate inhibits GCNT3 and mucins
We observed a consistent expression of GCNT3 and mucins in
the human pancreatic cancer specimens, GEM tissues, and human
pancreatic cancer cell lines that were analyzed (Figs. 1 and 2;
Supplementary Figs. S2–S4). We then sought to determine whether talniﬂumate inhibits GCNT3 and mucins in GEM in vivo.
Pancreata from 6-week-old Kras mice treated with talniﬂumate
for 1 week showed a signiﬁcant decrease in GCNT3 and mucin
expression in PanIN lesions (Fig. 5A). Further, GCNT3 protein
expression was signiﬁcantly decreased in the pancreas of talniﬂumate-treated Kras mice compared with untreated control
mouse pancreas (Fig. 5B). mRNA expression of GCNT3 was also
observed to be lower in pancreatic tissues from talniﬂumatetreated mice (Fig. 5C). These results support that talniﬂumate

(400 ppm) can inhibit GCNT3, and, thereby, mucins, in GEM in
vivo. Further, we also used next-generation Illumina sequencing to
evaluate pancreatic cancer in geﬁtinib-treated mice and controls
(Fig. 5D–G). The results clearly demonstrate that geﬁtinib treatment (100 ppm) signiﬁcantly decreases EGFR, GCNT3, and
mucins in the pancreas. Geﬁtinib signiﬁcantly reduced PanIN
lesions (PanIN1, 2, and 3) and carcinoma (Fig. 5F). Mice treated
with geﬁtinib showed more normal pancreatic tissues (i.e., free
from PanIN lesions and carcinoma) than did untreated mice
(Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D).

Combination of geﬁtinib and talniﬂumate inhibits GCNT3 and
mucins
We further determined the expression of mucins and GCNT3 in
the human pancreatic cancer Mia PaCa cells treated with talniﬂumate, geﬁtinib, and the combination of talniﬂumate and
geﬁtinib (Fig. 6). A signiﬁcant decrease in cell viability, GCNT3
expression, and number of mucin-expressing cells was seen after

treatment compared with untreated cells (Fig. 6). We also
observed a decrease in cell viability upon treatment with talniﬂumate and geﬁtinib in PANC-1 and BxPc-3 cells (Supplementary
Figs. S3–S5). Along with GCNT3, individual and combination
treatments also reduced mucins, PCNA, and cyclin D1 (Supplementary Fig. S4). These results justify the use of talniﬂumate for
mucin synthesis disruption, thereby enhancing the efﬁcacy of
EGFR inhibitors for pancreatic cancer treatment.

CRISPR GCNT3-KO leads to reduced cell viability and spheroid
formation
We next sought to determine whether knocking out GCNT3
inhibits cell growth and spheroid formation. Pancreatic cancer
cells were knocked out for GCNT3 using CRISPR technology
following the vendor's instruction. Transfection efﬁciency was
determined by GFP ﬂuorescence in GCNT3-KO cells (Fig. 7A).
After 48 hours, cells were harvested and evaluated for cell viability
via MTT assay (Fig. 7B) and spheroid formation in algimatrix 3D

signiﬁcantly reduced spheroid formation, and GCNT3-KO cells
did not form signiﬁcant numbers of spheroids (Fig. 7C). Further,
implanting GCNT3-KO cells into nude mice for in vivo studies will
help us to evaluate the tumor-forming ability of these cells.

Discussion
Pancreatic cancer has an aggressive nature and ranks among the
worst in survival rates of all epithelial cancers. The difﬁculties in
early diagnosis and the lack of effective therapies contribute to its
poor prognosis. One of the challenges in pancreatic cancer therapy is the failure of existing drugs to access their target sites due to
excess mucin production. Clinical and preclinical studies have
shown that various mucins (Muc1, Muc4, Muc13, and Muc5ac)
are signiﬁcantly overexpressed in pancreatic tumors. A large body

1972 Cancer Res; 76(7) April 1, 2016

of evidence supports the role of these mucins in tumor progression. Some have been studied as biomarkers or targeted for
pancreatic cancer treatment. Clinical studies suggest a correlation
between the overexpression of mucins and pancreatic cancer
(10–13), and have demonstrated a link between the aberrant
expression and differential overexpression of mucin glycoproteins
and the initiation, progression, and poor prognosis of the disease
(14–16, 19, 30). However, little advancement has been made in
this area. We sought to evaluate whether a mucin-synthesizing
gene could be an ideal target for pancreatic cancer intervention,
rather than simply targeting individual mucins. In this direction,
we identiﬁed GCNT3 as a potential target that is signiﬁcantly
overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer and is known to
decrease patient survival by 7 months (Fig. 1A). Further, 62.9%
of the patients with high GCNT3 expression had a history of
alcohol use, tobacco use, and/or diabetes. Our results suggest that
excessive mucin synthesis may be associated with these factors.

Control

We have shown that p48Cre/þ-LSL-KrasG12D/þ GEM with Kras
mutations display signiﬁcant dysregulation of EGFR and upregulation of mucin biosynthesis in PanIN lesions and PDAC (Fig. 2;
ref. 19). Further, next-generation transcriptome analysis revealed
that GCNT3 is aberrantly expressed in pancreatic tumors from
GEM compared with normal pancreas, and has increased mucin
subtypes. GCNT3 is a mucin core-synthesizing gene, and its
overexpression is associated with pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis
and enhanced proliferation (Fig. 3). Jones and colleagues (in
Supplementary Table S9; 20) demonstrated that normal pancreas
do not express GCNT3, whereas GCNT3 is overexpressed significantly in tumors from patients with pancreatic cancer. GCNT3 is
also expressed highly in human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Our
studies, preliminary reports, and the available literature support
the notion that GCNT3 is involved in mucin synthesis in pancreatic cancer, and is an attractive novel target for pancreatic cancer
treatment. However, no mucin synthesis inhibitors that affect
GCNT3 have been tested, and there are no published data that
support a direct role of GCNT3 in altering mucin synthesis during
pancreatic cancer growth.
Talniﬂumate is an orally available, small-molecule inhibitor,
and a potential muco-regulator that inhibits mucin synthesis,
blocks mucous overproduction in patients with chronic mucous
respiratory problems, and reduces cystic ﬁbrosis (31, 32). Talniﬂumate is also reported as calcium-activated chloride channel
(hCLCA1/mCLCA3) blocker; it reduces mucin synthesis in cell
culture and animal models. Its anti-inﬂammatory actions are via
inhibition of cyclooxygenases and inhibit Cl-/HCO3- exchanger
activity. Further, it increased survival in a cystic ﬁbrosis mouse
model of distal intestinal obstructive syndrome (31, 32). The
combination of these properties in an orally tolerated drug may be
useful in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Although talniﬂumate was shown to exert its effects by an anti-inﬂammatory
mechanism, studies have not supported its role as a mucous
inhibitor in pancreatic cancer. Hence, after synthesizing talniﬂumate and fully characterizing it using NMR, HMR, and HPLC
puriﬁcation, we used in silico molecular modeling approaches to
investigate the binding capability of talniﬂumate to GCNT3.

Impact of GCNT3 in Pancreatic Cancer

Talniﬂumate

GCNT3-KO

Compared with known ligand GALB1,3GALNAC, talniﬂumate
showed a best docking afﬁnity of 8.3 kcal/mol toward GCNT3,
with three notable hydrogen bonds between GCNT3 and talniﬂumate (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S6). After conﬁrming that
talniﬂumate effectively binds to GCNT3, we evaluated the effects
of talniﬂumate on GCNT3 expression in PanIN lesions from
GEM. Talniﬂumate signiﬁcantly reduced GCNT3 protein expression, mucins, and GCNT3 mRNA compared with untreated controls. These data further conﬁrm that talniﬂumate has an effect on
GCNT3.
Use of the EGFR inhibitor geﬁtinib (Iressa) signiﬁcantly
reduced tumor weight, PanINs, and PDAC, with an accompanying
signiﬁcant decrease in mucin synthesis and GCNT3, suggesting a
potential role of EGFR in the regulation of mucin biosynthesis
through GCNT3 (Fig. 3). Given that clinical doses of most FDAapproved EGFR inhibitors (geﬁtinib) are associated with skin
toxicity, it would be beneﬁcial to use lower doses of geﬁtinib along
with talniﬂumate to produce synergistic effects on inhibition of
tumor cell proliferation. The combination of talniﬂumate and
geﬁtinib showed a signiﬁcant decrease in GCNT3 and mucins with
reduced cell proliferation. Further, talniﬂumate inhibited spheroid formation, and CRISPR transfection of GCNT3 decreased cell
proliferation and spheroid formation.
However, further studies are warranted to evaluate the mechanism of GCNT3 regulation and talniﬂumate's effects on pancreatic cancer development in detail. Understanding the function of
GCNT3 and mucin synthesis in the setting of pancreatic cancer is
critically important to understanding the mechanisms of pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis and to developing new targeted therapies that reduce chemoresistance.
