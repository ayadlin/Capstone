ABSTRACT
Objectives: To evaluate the safety and efficiency of the conversion therapy :
chemotherapy plus anti-epidermal growth factor Receptor (EGFR) or anti-vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) with
different rat sarcoma (RAS) status in patients with potentially resectable colorectal
liver metastases (CRLM).
Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified and the association
between RAS mutation and clinical outcome in CRLM patients treated with anti-EGFR
or anti-VEGFR MoAbs was investigated. Searches were performed for data recorded
between January 2005 and August 2015 in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PubMed,
and EMBASE. Objective response rates (ORR), conversion resection rates (CRR), R0
resection rates (R0R) and rate ratios (RR) were used to assess the strength of the
association between different RAS status, MoAbs and conversion efficiency.
Results: In the conversion therapy, ORR and RR were associated with patients
with wild type RAS and different MoAbs. Patients treated with MoAbs: anti-VEGFR
or anti-EGFR drugs, resulted in higher ORR, (RR=1.53, 95% confidence interval
[CI]: 1.27-1.84, P < 0.05). Furthermore, anti-EGFR regimens displayed higher ORR
compared with anti-VEGFR regimens in CRLM patients, (RR=1.15, 95%CI: 1.04-1.26,
P < 0.05). However, CRLM patients with mutant type RAS did not benefit from antiEGFR therapy, (RR=0.91, 95%CI: 0.76-1.08, P<0.05) and wild type RAS patients
displayed higher ORR with anti-EGFR therapy, (RR=1.56, 95%CI: 1.16-2.01, P <0.05).
In addition, the patients achieved higher resection rates (RR=1.67, 95%CI: 1.00-2.81,
P ≤ 0.05) and R0 resection (RR=1.85, 95%CI: 1.04-3.27, P < 0.05).
Conclusion: We noted that the addition of MoAbs (anti-EGFR or anti-VEGFR)
to standard chemotherapy could improve conversion efficiency for patients with
potentially resectable CRLM patients, and anti-EGFR therapies maybe more effective
than anti-VEGFR therapies. RAS status is a potential predictive marker of the clinical
benefit resulting from treatment with anti-EGFR MoAbs therapy in CRLM patients and
anti-EGFR MoAbs therapy could displayed greater efficiency only in patients with wild
type RAS.

INTRODUCTION

globally per year [1]. At least 50% of patients develop
metastases [2]. Fewer than 12.9% of patients with stage
4 colorectal cancer had a 5-year survival [3]. Only a few
patients with liver-only metastatic disease had a 30-60%
chance of survival 5 years after surgical resection [4]. This

stark difference in 5-year survival highlighted the potential
benefits of liver resection. However, the majority patients
have unresectable tumors [5], and preoperative therapy
may raise the hope of these patients. Preoperative therapy
is administered in either of two settings: neoadjuvant
therapy is administered preoperatively for initially CRLM,
making the resection from Rx to R0 (Rx resection: presence
of residual tumor cannot be assessed, R0 resection:
macroscopically complete removal by non-contaminated
surgery with wide or radical margin, R1 resection:
microscopic residual tumor) [10], and conversion therapy
is given to patients with initially unresectable disease in
an attempt to render the patient’s disease resectable [12].
Systemic conversion therapy may include combinations of
chemotherapeutic agents (irinotecan or oxaliplatin-based),
with or without the use of targeted MoAbs targeting (antiVEGFR: bevacizumab or anti-EGFR: cetuximab and
panitumumab). The efficiency of the targeted therapy
is associated with the gene status and the identification
of the correlation between a mutated cancer gene and
the response to a targeted therapy is complex. This may
be due to intratumor heterogeneity [13]. Different RAS
type tumors should be evaluated especially in patients
administered anti-EGFR MoAbs. The efficiency of
conversion therapy depends upon response rate and R0
resection, and a strong relationship between the tumor
rate ratio (RR) and resection rates has been demonstrated
in patients with CRLM treated with chemotherapy [12].
Although the conversion therapy could provide benefits for
the patients with unresectable CRLM, the preferred choice
of MoAbs for conversion therapy remains debatable,
and there has been no randomized study specifically
investigating patients with borderline resectable CRLM
[7]. Therefore, the choice of standard chemotherapy to be
administered, and whether or which type of MoAbs should
be used in conversion therapy has yet to be elucidated by
RCTs and need to be explored.

(ECOG) score standard; no detectable extrahepatic tumors;
and age of 18-80 years. The exclusion criteria were: nonrandomized controlled trials; use of neoadjuvant therapy;
and failure to comply with any of the above inclusion
criteria.

Quality assessment
Two reviewers (WL and SYN) reviewed
independently to assess the eligibility of each study for
inclusion. Any discrepancy in the selection of studies
or data retrieved by the reviewers was resolved by
discussion with a third reviewer. The quality of the
included literatures was appraised and graded according
to PRISMA Checklist and a modified Jadad scale [14]
as follows: low quality, 1-3 points; and high quality 4-7
points. Others were excluded to reduce the influence
of the critical analysis result for the RCTs with high
statistical power and consistent reporting, with a score
of 3 considered acceptable and a higher score indicating
better reporting.

Data extraction and analysis
Objective response rates (ORR), conversion
resection rates (CRR), R0 resection rates (R0R) and RR
were selected for the statistical analysis of the data. The
analyses were defined prospectively in a statistical analysis
plan. The heterogeneity analysis was performed prior to
combining data (heterogeneity was quantitatively analyzed
using I²): heterogeneity was considered mild when I² <
25%; moderate when 25% ≤ I² < 50%; great when 50%
≤ I² < 75%; and high when 75% ≤ I² < 100%. The fixed
analysis was performed using RevMan 5.2 software on
the data with low heterogeneity; Random analysis was
performed for the data with higher heterogeneity. All
reported 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p values
following a two-sided test with a value of p ≤ 0.05 were
considered indicative of statistical significance.

RESULTS

The intervention measures in the present metaanalysis involved a comparison of the three groups
follows: anti-VEGFR MoAbs plus chemotherapy vs. antiEGFR MoAbs plus chemotherapy vs. placebo (or blank
control) plus chemotherapy prior to the surgical resection.
Searches were performed for data recorded between
January 2005 and August 2015 in the Cochrane Library,
MEDLINE, PubMed, and EMBASE. The search terms
were: “Conversion therapy”, “CRLM” and “MoAbs”.
The inclusion criteria were histologically established
unresectable CRLM by pathology or imaging; 0-2 points
according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group

chemotherapy with pure chemotherapy. Three reports
were used to investigate the efficiency of anti-EGFR
vs. anti-VEGFR therapy in the conversion therapy for
potentially CRLM. Five reports were referenced for the
comparison of anti-EGFR MoAbs in mutant or wild RAS
status in Figure 1.
The 13 studies comprised 7,520 cases in total, with
3,756 cases were from treatment groups and 3,764 from
control groups. The characteristics of the included data are
displayed in Table 1.

ORR data for different MoAbs were provided in 3
studies [25-27]. The combined analysis of the 3 studies
suggested mild heterogeneity (I² = 12%), and a combined
RR for ORR of 1.15 (95%CI: 1.04-1.26, p < 0.05) was
obtained using a fixed-effects model (Figure 3).

Effect of targeted drugs vs. chemotherapy on ORR

ORR data for anti-EGFR targeted chemotherapy in
different patients with RAS/K-RAS status were provided
in 5 studies [17, 20-22, 24]. In the mutant type RAS/KRAS patients, the combined analysis of the 4 studies
suggested mild heterogeneity (I² = 20%), and a combined
RR for ORR of 0.91 (95%CI: 0.77-1.08, p = 0.28) was
obtained using a fixed-effects model. In the wild type
RAS/K-RAS patients, the combined analysis of the 5
studies [17, 20-22, 24] suggested high heterogeneity (I² =
87%), and a combined RR for ORR of 1.56(95%CI: 1.162.10, p < 0.05) was obtained using the random-effects
model (Figure 4).

ORR data for patients were provided in 10
studies [15-24]. The combined analysis of the 10 studies
suggested great heterogeneity (I² = 80%), and a combined
RR for ORR of 1.53(95%CI: 1.27-1.84, p < 0.05) was
obtained using a random-effects model (Figure 2).

Publication bias

Conversion resection rates (CRR)
CRR data for anti-EGFR targeted chemotherapy
were provided in five studies, and the combined analysis
of these studies [19, 20, 22-24] suggested moderate
heterogeneity (I² = 31%), and a combined RR for CRR of
1.67 (95%CI: 1.00-2.81, P ≤ 0.05) was obtained using a
random-effects model(Figure 4).

Publication bias was determined by Begg’s funnel
plot and the Egger linear regression test to detect the
funnel plot asymmetry. If the Egger test calculated p <
0.05, publication bias was assessed to exist. Our results
demonstrated that there was no evident publication bias in
the present meta-analysis.

R0 resection rates (R0R)
R0R data for anti-EGFR targeted chemotherapy were
provided in these studies, and the combined analysis of the
5 studies [19, 20, 22-24] indicated moderate heterogeneity
(I² = 35%), and a combined RR for R0R of 1.85(95%CI:
1.04-3.27, p < 0.05) was obtained using a random-effects
model(Figure 4).

DISCUSSION
The primary aim of treatment for the CRLM is
conversion to resectable as it provides the only possibility
for cure [28]. A staging system was proposed by the
European Colorectal Metastases Treatment Group system
that divides the CRLM into 4 groups. These include M0:
no metastases; M1a: resectable liver metastases; M1b:
potentially resectable liver metastases; and M1c: liver
metastases that are unlikely to ever be resectable. For
M1a resectable patients and M1b patients who qualify as
resectable after systemic treatment, resection offers the
possibility of a cure. For the M1c group, the possibility

Sensitivity analysis
Every study was excluded each time to assess
the effect of the individual data set to the pooled RRs,
and studies with high heterogeneity were subsequently
removed.

of resection should not be excluded and each case
should be considered individually [8]. In conversion
therapy, common combined chemotherapy regimens
include FOLFIRI [21], FOLFOX [22] and CAPOX [23].
However, the efficiency of such chemotherapy is only
30-40%, even in first line application. Also the addition
of anti-VEGFR/EGFR agents could improve both OS
and the rates of secondary resection [21-23]. The present
study confirmed the conversion efficiency of different
MoAbs plus chemotherapy in patients with wild or mutant
type RAS. The study was also able to ascertain from
data concerning the ORR, that conversion therapy with
MoAbs(anti-EGFR or anti-VEGFR) was more efficacious
than simple chemotherapy. When comparing the two types
of MoAbs therapy, anti-EGFR elicited a better response.
From the study, patients with wild type RAS could benefit
from anti-EGFR conversion therapy. However, there was
no observed benefit for patients with the mutant type
RAS considering whether MoAbs were administered.
The underlying mechanisms involve RAS proteins, which

are GTPases and molecular switches for a variety of
critical cellular activities involving K-RAS, N-RAS, and
H-RAS in the EGFR signaling pathway. Their function
is tightly monitored in normal cells but the oncogenic
mutation of the RAS gene, which creates constitutively
active RAS proteins, result in uncontrolled proliferation
or survival in tumor cells and resistance to anti-EGFR
drugs[29]. Therefore, the wild type RAS patients were
included to evaluate the overall conversion resection and
R0R following treatment with anti-EGFR MoAbs plus
chemotherapy. Both R0 resection and overall resection
rate indicated the advantages of anti-EGFR MoAbs in
conversion therapy. Certain factors were not considered in
the study design of the present meta-analysis. For patients
with RAS and BRAF mutations, triplet chemotherapy and
combinations with bevacizumab represented two rational
alternatives on the basis of high response rates and tumor
shrinkage [30]; however their efficacy in the conversion
setting has yet to be confirmed in specifically designed
studies. The gene type of RAS analysis in this study were

included both RAS and K-RAS for the technology of
detecting RAS was created in the recent years and a part
of RCTs only described the K-RAS type. In addition, not
all the studies selected presented the resection rate or R0
resection but only the ORR and unequivocal on ORR and
resection rate in potentially resectable patients are still

required in order for the heterogeneity to be amplified.
In clinical trials regarding adverse effects, it has
been revealed that chemotherapy may induce liver
damage; in particular oxaliplatin has been associated
with sinusoidal wall disruption, resulting in sinusoidal
obstruction (SOS) [32]. Similarly, irinotecan can induce

a form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease known as
steatohepatitis [33].Therefore, in order to decrease these
and improve the therapeutic efficiency for patients with
colorectal cancer, molecularly targeted therapies have
been developed [34], among which, the rates reported
are 43-81% with the addition of the molecular targeted
drug bevacizumab or cetuximab and panitumumab [35].
Molecular targeted drugs expand specific changes in
tumor cells to achieve relative target specificity. This not
only enhances the anti-cancer effect, but also reduces the
damage to normal cells.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates a
clear incentive to select MoAbs for the treatment of
potentially resectable CRLM patients with different
RAS/K-RAS status. MoAbs proffer additional benefits in
conversion therapy compared to the simple chemotherapy.
Furthermore, patients excluded mutant type RAS/K-RAS
could benefit from MoAbs for the conversion therapy and
among the different MoAbs, anti-EGFR therapies have
greater efficacy compared to anti-VEGFR, however, this
is only the case for patients with wild type RAS/K-RAS.
