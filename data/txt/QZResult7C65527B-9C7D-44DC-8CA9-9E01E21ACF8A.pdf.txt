BACKGROUND. The study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of concomitant
and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme versus initial radiotherapy alone from a public health care
perspective.

METHODS. The economic evaluation was performed alongside a randomized, multicenter, phase 3 trial. The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival. Costs
included all direct medical costs. Economic data were collected prospectively for a
subgroup of 219 patients (38%). Unit costs for drugs, procedures, laboratory and
imaging, radiotherapy, and hospital costs per day were collected from the official
national reimbursement lists based on 2004. For the cost-effectiveness analysis,
survival was expressed as 2.5 years restricted mean estimates. The incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was constructed. Confidence intervals for the ICER
were calculated using the Fieller method and bootstrapping.

RESULTS. The difference in 2.5 years restricted mean survival between the treatment arms was 0.25 life-years and the ICER was E37,361 per life-year gained
with a 95% confidence interval (CI) ranging from E19,544 to E123,616. The area
between the survival curves of the treatment arms suggests an increase of the
overall survival gain for a longer follow-up. An extrapolation of the overall survival per treatment arm and imputation of costs for the extrapolated survival
showed a substantial reduction in ICER.

CONCLUSIONS. The ICER of E37,361 per life-year gained is a conservative estimate. We concluded that despite the high TMZ acquisition costs, the costs per
life-year gained are comparable to accepted first-line treatment with chemotherapy in patients with cancer. Cancer 2008;112:1337–44.  2008 American Cancer

lioblastoma is the most frequent primary malignant brain tumor in adults. The median survival
is generally less than 1 year from the time of diagnosis and most patients die within 2 years.1–3 Standard
therapy consists of surgical resection to the extent
that is safely feasible, followed by radiotherapy; in
the US, adjuvant carmustine, a nitrosourea drug, is
commonly prescribed.4,5 A meta-analysis based on
12 randomized trials suggested a small survival benefit of chemotherapy, as compared with radiotherapy
alone (a 5% increase in survival at 2 years, from 15%
to 20%).6
Temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating agent,
has demonstrated antitumor activity as a single agent
in the treatment of recurrent glioma.7,8 This drug is
tolerated well by most patients, has a favorable safety
profile, and is associated with only mild side effects
compared with nitrosoureas.9 In a large, randomized,
multicenter, phase 3 trial treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma with concomitant administration
of TMZ with fractionated radiotherapy, followed by
up to 6 cycles of adjuvant TMZ was compared with
radiotherapy alone. This trial showed that patients
assigned to initial combined modality therapy with
TMZ and radiation had a significantly prolonged survival compared with radiotherapy alone. Quality of
life analysis suggested that this survival prolongation
can be considered meaningful and without significant decrease of health-related quality of life due to
chemotherapy administration.10,11
When new agents or treatment modalities are
introduced to the clinic, attention should focus not
only on efficacy and safety but also on costs and on
the relation between cost and effectiveness. This is of
particular importance for agents with high acquisition costs, such as TMZ. The additional costs of
using TMZ as concomitant and adjuvant treatment
agent until disease recurrence for first-line treatment
of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were estimated at
about E21,000, an 8-fold increase compared with
standard radiation treatment alone.12 The aim of this
study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of concomitant and adjuvant TMZ for the treatment of
newly diagnosed glioblastoma compared with radiotherapy alone. This economic evaluation was planned
and performed alongside the above-described randomized phase 3 study.

Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) and the National Cancer Institute of Canada
Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG). Patients were randomly allocated to either radiotherapy alone (60 Gy
given in fractions of 2 Gy for 30 weekdays) or to
radiotherapy (same regimen as control group) with
concomitant TMZ given before radiotherapy
(Temodar, Temodal, Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ;
75 mg/m2 a day starting on Day 1 of radiotherapy to
the last day of radiotherapy, or for a maximum of
49 days), followed after a 4-week break by up to 6
cycles of adjuvant TMZ (150–200 mg/m2 a day for 5
days every 4 weeks). Randomization was stratified by
institution, performance status (ie, WHO 0 vs 1–2),
and type of surgery (biopsy only vs complete or
incomplete resection). Details on trial conduct and
clinical outcome have been reported previously.10
In all, 85 institutions from 15 countries entered
573 patients in this trial. The economic evaluation is
based on data of patients of a selected number of
centers. Participation by centers in the economic
evaluation study was left optional, but especially the
larger centers participated. For the final economic
evaluation sample the selection was based on patient
accrual on the country level and in addition on the
recruitment of patients per center; 219 patients from
15 institutions in 5 countries (Austria, Switzerland,
Germany, Canada, and the Netherlands) formed the
economic evaluation subsample.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Resource Use and Costs
Information of resource use of the initial treatment
in both arms was collected from the trial database.
The number of sessions and type of radiotherapy, the
total dose of TMZ during radiotherapy and adjuvant

Patients
Patients aged 18–70 years with newly diagnosed glioblastoma after biopsy or resection were eligible for
this international, multicenter trial by the European

Measurement of Effectiveness
Effectiveness was primarily measured by the overall
survival (OS). The time interval between date of randomization and death was the duration of survival.
Progression-free survival (PFS) was used as a secondary endpoint. PFS was defined as radiologic or neurologic or clinical progression, whichever occurred
first. The time horizon was in principle until death of
all patients. However, at the time data were extracted
from the trial database (August, 2005) some patients
were still alive resulting in administrative (right) censoring. The difference in OS and PFS were calculated
as the area between the curves of the 2 arms using a
restricted mean survival method, ie, the Irwin restricted mean,13 and expressed as life-years gained
(LYG) and PFS gained. If death occurred without evidence of progression the date of death was considered as the date of progression.

therapy, and concomitant medications during the
whole treatment phase were derived from the clinical
record forms (CRF).
The number of laboratory tests was derived from
the CRF from initial therapy until end of clinical
follow-up. No data on laboratory tests were collected
after progression. Costs related to treatment-induced
toxicity leading through hospitalization were derived
from the severe adverse events (SAEs) forms
and documentation. For the economic analysis, only
hospitalizations for events of grades 3 and 4 were
considered.
From the end of active treatment until disease
progression only hospitalizations were tracked
through the SAEs. It is recognized that this results in
an underestimation of the true hospitalization rate
during this period. As this is unlikely to be related to
the previous treatment administered, a bias can be
excluded. On a specific health economic form (HEF)
the following information was filled out every 3
months: the number of control visits, the number of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans performed, second- or thirdline therapy (type and dosage of chemotherapy,
repeat surgery, if applicable) and in case of hospitalization, length of stay and type of hospitalization
unit.
Unit costs for each of the resource components
were collected from the official national reimbursement lists. The base year for unit costs was 2004.
Costs were calculated by multiplication of each unit
of resource use by its unit price (see Table 1). The
results presented are based on Dutch unit prices.
The results are presented with and without discounting of both costs and health effects (Table 1). The
Dutch discount rates are used, ie, 4% for costs and
1.5% for health effects.14

Statistical and Economic Analyses
The perspective of the economic evaluation study is
that of the Public Health Care System in the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Canada. All economic analyses are conducted from an ‘intention to treat’
perspective.
Differences in resource utilization between the 2
arms were assessed. Therefore, the proportion of
patients using a particular resource and the number
of units of medical resources between the arms were
compared. A comparison in resource use between
the arms provides insight into major cost drivers. Per
arm, the average total costs were assessed and compared using a parametric t-test and by bootstrap.
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)
between both arms was constructed. CIs for the

1339

ICER were calculated using the Fieller method (parametric approach).15
In the statistical analysis, besides the calculation
of parametric CIs, a bootstrap procedure was performed (nonparametric approach). In such a procedure a random sample with replacement is taken
from the original sample of patients, for both groups,
with a size equal to the original sample size, ie, 108
patients in the radiotherapy-only group and 110
patients in the radiotherapy 1 TMZ group. For such
a bootstrap sample, again additional costs and
effects and the ICER can be calculated. This procedure was repeated 2500 times to assess the uncertainty around the ICER. Each pair of additional costs
and additional effects is displayed in a scatter diagram, ie, graphically presented on the cost-effectiveness plane.
With the outcomes of the bootstrap procedure, a
so-called cost effectiveness acceptability curve is
constructed.16 This curve shows for every threshold
value society may define for the ICER the probability
that the ICER is below that limit.
No sensitivity analysis was undertaken, as most
variations in cost or survival were included in the
bootstrap estimates of the ICER.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Survival
For a subset of 219 of all 573 patients (38%) who participated in this trial, information is available on
healthcare utilization after progression of disease
until death or up to 2.5 years since randomization.
The cost-effectiveness analysis is based on this subset of patients. Compared with the total sample of
573 patients the patients in the radiotherapy 1 TMZ
group of the economic evaluation subset were statistically significant younger, and the proportion of
patients in the radiotherapy-only group of the economic subset with a total resection before randomization was significantly lower.
No statistically significant differences in overall
and PFS between the economic subsample and the
rest of the full cohorts were found for either treatment arm. Overall survival and PFS were longer in
patients treated with radiotherapy 1 TMZ, in concordance with the overall study results. The 2.5-year
restricted mean overall survival was 0.25 life-year
longer in the radiotherapy 1 TMZ group; the 2.5year restricted mean PFS was 0.27 life-year longer.
Because administrative censoring occurred after 2.5
years, 2.5 years was chosen to restrict survival
(Fig. 1).

ication, imaging, visits, and hospitalizations for SAEs
grade 3 and 4 was higher in the radiotherapy 1 TMZ
group. After progression of disease, the number of
patients having second-line treatment with TMZ was
higher in the radiotherapy-only group than for the

1341

radiotherapy 1 TMZ group (48 patients [44%] vs 15
patients [14%]).
For the radiotherapy-only arm the mean costs
before progression were significantly lower than in
the radiotherapy 1 TMZ group (Table 3). Mean costs
for all types of resource use were lower in the radiotherapy-only group except for the costs of radiotherapy, which were about the same in both groups.
After progression the radiotherapy-only group had
significantly higher costs for chemotherapy. For the
use of TMZ a ‘cross-over effect’ was observed, ie,
many patients in the radiotherapy-only group
received second-line treatment with TMZ. The mean
total costs were E9383 higher in the radiotherapy 1 TMZ group. After application of discounting
the difference in mean total costs between the
groups hardly changed.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
One patient in the radiotherapy 1 TMZ group was
censored before 2.5-year follow-up at 2.26 life-years.
This patient had progression of disease before censoring. For the cost-effectiveness analysis the lifeyears of this patient were extrapolated to 2.5 years
and the mean cost per day in the third year after
randomization until censoring were imputed for the
number of days between censoring and 2.5 years.
The difference in mean costs between the treatment
arms became E9415 and the difference in 2.5 years
restricted survival 0.252 (discounted costs and lifeyears: E9402 and 0.248, respectively).
In Table 4 point-estimates for ICERs and the 95%
CIs are shown. The health effect was expressed in
life-years gained and progression-free life-years
gained. Based on Dutch unit costs the ICER was
E37,361 per life-year gained and E34,870 per progression-free life-year gained. When Swiss unit costs
were used the ICER was E43,786 per life-year gained
and E40,867 per progression-free life-year gained;
application of Canadian unit costs resulted in ICERs
of E34,868 per life-year gained and E32,543 per progression-free life-year gained.
Besides the calculation of parametric CIs, a bootstrap procedure was performed. In Figure 2 the
results of the bootstrap are graphically presented on
the cost-effectiveness plane. Figure 2 shows the discounted results. The ICER and 95% CI estimated
with the bootstrap procedure were similar to the
results of the parametric approach presented in
Table 4.
With the outcomes of the bootstrap procedure, a
so-called cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was
constructed. Figure 3 shows the discounted results.

Censoring occurred after 2.5 years of follow-up.
However, the survival data (Fig. 1) suggested an
increase of the overall survival gain for a longer follow-up. Therefore, the overall survival per treatment
arm was extrapolated beyond the trial time horizon.
The difference in extrapolated mean overall survival
between the treatment arms was 0.53 life-year for
extrapolation using the Weibull distribution and 0.67
life-year for the generalized gamma distribution.
Using the mean costs per observed day in the
first half of the third year since randomization (E6.33
in the radiotherapy-only group and E15.91 in the
radiotherapy 1 TMZ group) to calculate the costs in
the extrapolated survival, a point estimate for an
extrapolated ICER was made. The extrapolated
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was E21,299
(5 11,279 of 0.53) per life-year gained for extrapolation of survival with the Weibull distribution and
E18,154 (5 12,100 of 0.67) for extrapolation of survival with the generalized gamma distribution.

DISCUSSION
This economic evaluation accompanied the randomized phase 3 clinical trial, which established the
clinical benefit of adding concomitant and adjuvant
TMZ treatment to radiotherapy in patients with
newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Concomitant and adjuvant treatment with TMZ compared with radiotherapy alone improved survival and increased the costs
of treatment, resulting in an ICER of E37,361 per
life-year gained. The mean costs of initial treatment
until progression of disease in the radiotherapy 1
TMZ group were E13,136 higher than in radiotherapy-only group. The acquisition of TMZ accounted
for 89% of this difference in mean costs. The difference in mean total costs was E9383 in favor of the
radiotherapy-only group. When Canadian and Swiss
unit costs were used instead of Dutch unit prices the
ICER changed to E34,868 and E43,786 per life-year
gained. This was mainly caused by the higher price
of TMZ in Switzerland and a lower price of TMZ in
Canada.
After progression of disease, relatively many
patients in the radiotherapy group received secondline treatment with TMZ. This ‘cross-over effect’
reduced the difference in total costs between the
treatment arms. Because TMZ given at the time of
recurrence of GBM has some activity, this will have
contributed to the survival of patients. There are

1343

trials showing 20% 6-month PFS in that situation.8
So there is a clinical benefit, as we can also hypothesize in view of the superior survival of MGMT promoter methylated patients in the radiotherapy-only
arm.10 Therefore, it is not clear how this ‘cross-over
effect’ of TMZ use affected the ICER.
Ideally, the ICER is expressed as costs per quality
adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. In the accompanying randomized phase 3 trial we performed an economic evaluation of health-related quality of life as
assessed with the EORTC QLQ C3017 at baseline and
during treatment at 3-month intervals until progression. It was concluded that the addition of TMZ during and after radiotherapy did not negatively impact
quality of life.11 For the EORTC QLQ C30 no preference weights or utilities are available to calculate
QALYs. Therefore, we were not able to express the
health effects in terms of QALY gained. The difference over a period of 2.5 years in restricted mean
overall survival was 0.25 life-year. Adjustment of this
difference in life-years for quality of life will result in
a mean difference of survival of less than 0.25 QALYs.
Therefore, the costs per QALY gained will be higher
than the ICERs we presented.
PFS was used as a secondary endpoint. The ICER
was E35,000 per progression-free life-year gained.
Using PFS as a measure of effectiveness can be seen
as applying a weight equal to 1 for the life-years
before progression of disease and a weight of 0 after
progression of disease. The use of PFS as a proxy for
quality of life will therefore result in an overestimation of the quality of life before progression of disease and an underestimation after progression.
In both treatment arms for less than 10% of the
days between progression and 2.5 years after randomization HEFs, ie, information on resource use, were
missing. Our results were based on zero costs for
each day of missing resource use information after
progression. Because the proportion missing resource
use days for both groups is about the same and relatively small, we refrained from imputing costs for the
days with missing resource use information.18
The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on
data from 2.5 years of follow-up. The overall survival
curves suggest an increase of the overall mean survival gain for a longer follow-up. The survival gain after 2.5 years was associated with an increase in the
mean costs difference between the treatment arms.
When the increase in survival gain is proportionally
larger than the increase of the cost difference the
costs per life-year gained will decrease. An extrapolation of the overall survival per treatment arm and
imputation of costs for the extrapolated survival
showed a substantial reduction in ICER to about

E21,000 per life-year gained. An economic evaluation
with a longer follow-up, preferably with the ICER in
terms of costs per QALY gained, can provide a more
definite answer of the effect of a longer follow-up period on the ICER.
We conclude that the presented ICER of E37,000
per life-year gained, which was based on 2.5 years
restricted cost and survival data, is a conservative
estimate. These costs per life-year gained are comparable to accepted first-line treatment with chemotherapy in patients with cancer.19,20 We conclude
that despite the high TMZ acquisition costs, concomitant and adjuvant TMZ provided also significant
benefits in newly diagnosed glioblastoma.
