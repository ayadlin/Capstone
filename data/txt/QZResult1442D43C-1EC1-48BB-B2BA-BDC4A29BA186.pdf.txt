Abstract
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathways
interact at multiple nodes in cancer, including at mTOR complexes, suggesting an increased likelihood of
redundancy and innate resistance to any therapeutic effects of single pathway inhibition. In this study, we
investigated the therapeutic effects of combining the MAPK extracellular signal–regulated kinase (MEK)1/2
inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244) with the dual mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitor (AZD8055). Concurrent
dosing in nude mouse xenograft models of human lung adenocarcinoma (non–small cell lung cancers) and
colorectal carcinoma was well tolerated and produced increased antitumor efﬁcacy relative to the respective
monotherapies. Pharmacodynamic analysis documented reciprocal pathway inhibition associated with
increased apoptosis and Bim expression in tumor tissue from the combination group, where key genes such
as DUSP6 that are under MEK functional control were also modulated. Our work offers a strong rationale
to combine selumetinib and AZD8055 in clinical trials as an attractive therapeutic strategy. Cancer Res; 72(7);

Introduction
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) intracellular signaling cascade comprises Ras, Raf, MAPK extracellular
signal–regulated kinase (MEK), extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and ribosomal S6 kinases and transmits
signals from a number of stimuli including growth factors,
hormones, and neurotransmitters, to many cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, and cell-cycle
progression (1). The pathway is commonly activated in
human cancer through activating mutations of BRAF or the
upstream small GTPase reticular activating system. Mutations in KRAS occur in 90% of pancreatic cancers, 45% of

colorectal, and 20% of non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC)
with BRAF mutations present in approximately 20% to 60%
of melanomas, 35% to 70% of papillary thyroid, and 12% of
colorectal cancers (CRC; ref. 2). Consequently, members of
this signaling pathway, including MEK, have been pursued as
potential anticancer therapeutic targets. MEK contains 2
consensus kinase motifs which are involved in the phosphorylation of serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. Two
homologs exist, MEK1 and MEK2, which have only one
known substrate, ERK1/2, which has multiple downstream
effectors involved in a number of cellular functions including
transcription (e.g., Elk1), cell-cycle progression (e.g., Rb), and
cell motility (e.g., JNK; ref. 1). p90RSK is activated by ERK1/2
and phosphorylates a number of substrates including elongation initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1),
ribosomal protein S6 (S6), and Tuberin (TSC2), which are
also downstream substrates of the AKT/mTOR pathway.
Preclinical data showing sensitivity to a number of agents
targeting MEK1/2 have been reported in vitro and in vivo,
and clinical trials of these agents as monotherapies and in
combination are ongoing (3–6).
In addition to MAPK pathway activation, dysregulation of
the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) cascade occurs in a
number of human cancers. For example, in breast cancer
activating mutations of the catalytic subunit of PI3K, p110a (PIK3CA), occur in 30% of breast cancers and approximately
25% of NSCLC have lost expression of the PTEN tumor
suppressor gene, whereas in ovarian cancers 3% to 8% have
mutated and 27% have lost PTEN (7–9). Further down this

Preclinical Combinations of Selumetinib and AZD8055 In Vivo

pathway, mutations in the tumor suppressor LKB1 have been
associated with 30% NSCLC (10, 11). A number of molecules
targeting components of the PI3K pathway are currently in
clinical development (12). mTOR, a serine/theronine kinase, is
a downstream effector of the pathway, although the PI3K
pathway is not an exclusive activator of mTOR. The protein
functions as a sensor of mitogen, energy, and nutrient levels
and is a central controller of cell growth (13). Furthermore,
mTOR has also been identiﬁed as a negative regulator of
autophagy (13). mTOR forms 2 distinct complexes, mTORC1
(raptor, mLST8, and PRAS40), which is nutrient sensitive, and
mTORC2 (rictor, SIN1, and protor) a nutrient and growth
factor–sensitive complex. Inhibitors, such as rapamycin, inhibit the mTORC1 complex by blocking the phosphorylation of 2
major downstream kinases, p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) and 4EBP1. However, preclinical data with mTOR kinase inhibitors
including AZD8055 suggest that the inhibition of mTORC1 by
rapamycin is only partial (14–16). Also, because of a negative
feedback loop between p70S6K and the insulin-like receptor
substrate-1 (IRS1), it has been shown that inhibition of
mTORC1 activates AKT (17). Rapalogues have shown antitumor activity and are registered for use in a number of oncology
settings, including renal cell carcinoma (18).
In tumor types in which mutations/modulations in either
MAPK or PI3K pathway predominate, monotherapy can be
considered and has shown to be effective (19, 20). However, a
number of studies have presented ﬁndings that highlight
acquired resistance after inhibition of one of these pathways
alone (21). In addition, a number of reports have shown the
presence of feedback loops that promote activity of the pathway upstream of the inhibition site. For example, rapamycin
has been shown to induce the phosphorylation of AKT and
eIF4E, which was overcome by the addition of the PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 (22). Furthermore, another study showed
enhanced MAPK pathway signaling in a PI3K-dependent feedback loop when TORC1 inhibitors were administered. Subsequently this was shown to be overcome when the MAPK
pathway was inhibited (23). It has also been observed that
inhibition of the MAPK pathway results in upregulation of the
PI3K pathway (24). In all of these situations coadministration
of inhibitors from both pathways was able to overcome the
negative feedback and enhance antitumor efﬁcacy in cell lines
and/or xenograft models (25–27). Taken together, these observations suggest that in some settings suppression of one
pathway alone may not be sufﬁcient (28–30).
In this article we investigate the preclinical efﬁcacy of a
novel combination of selumetinib (AZD6244) a potent,
selective, and ATP-uncompetitive inhibitor of MEK1/2 currently in phase II clinical trials (19, 31, 32) and AZD8055, a
recently described (14), potent speciﬁc inhibitor of mTORC1
and mTORC2 kinase currently in phase I clinical trials. Here,
we present evidence that combining these 2 inhibitors in
human tumor NSCLC and CRC cell–derived xenograft and
primary patient explant models shows enhanced antitumor
activity. Furthermore, we present pharmacodynamic data
from our in vivo studies showing inhibition of the PI3K and
MAPK pathways and induction of apoptosis when the 2
agents are combined.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Selumetinib and AZD8055 were prepared as previously
reported (14, 33).
Cell culture
All cell lines, including those used in human tumor xenograft
studies, were cultured and assayed in Dulbecco's modiﬁed
Eagle's medium (phenol red free) or RPMI 1640 þ 10% fetal calf
serum þ 1% glutamine. All cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection and no further characterization was done.
Cell line xenografts
Female nude mice (nu/nu:Alpk; AstraZeneca) were housed in
negative pressure isolators (PFI Systems Ltd.). Experiments
were conducted in 8- to 12-week-old animals in full accordance
with the United Kingdom Home Ofﬁce Animal (Scientiﬁc
Procedures) Act 1986. Human tumor xenografts were established by subcutaneous injection of 1  107, 5  106, 1  106, 1 
107, 2.5  106, and 1  106 cells per mouse for HCT-116, A549,
CaLu-6, LoVo, NCI-H2122, and NCI-H460, respectively. Animals were randomized into treatment groups (n ¼ 12–14 in
vehicle control group, n ¼ 8–12 in treated groups) when
tumors reached a deﬁned palpable size (0.2 cm3). Selumetinib
and AZD8055 were administered by oral gavage (0.1 mL/10g).
The control group received both vehicles. In the combination
group, selumetinib was administered 2 hours before AZD8055.
Tumor volume (measured by calipers), animal body weight,
and tumor condition were recorded twice weekly during the
study.
Pharmacodynamic sampling
At a deﬁned time point selected mice were humanely culled
tumors excised and cut into 2 pieces; one half was snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen, whereas the other was ﬁxed in 10% formalin
buffer for 24 hours and embedded in parafﬁn for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining.
Immunoblotting
Protein lysate preparation and immunoblotting was done as
previously described (34). Immunoblots were stained with
anti-Bim (1:1,000; Chemicon), PARP (1:1,000; Cell Signaling
Technology), total MAPK (1:1,000; Cell signalling Technology),
phospho MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), total S6 (1:1000; Cell signalling Technology), pS6
(Ser235/236; 1:1,000; Cell signalling Technology), total 4EBP1 (1:1,000; Cell signalling Technology), phospho 4E-BP-1 (35/46;
1:1,000; Cell signalling Technology), and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, 1:2,000; Abcam).
Meso scale discovery protein analysis platform
Protein lysate (0.5 mg/mL) was added per well of the MSD
plate and each sample was run in duplicate. Assays were
carried out and results calculated as per the manufacturers
instructions (MSD) for phospho (473)/total Akt (K11100D) and
analyzed on a SECTOR Imager 6000 (MSD). Results are presented as a ratio of phospho to total protein.

with the vehicle-treated group. Two further NSCLC models,
NCI-H2122 and NCI-H460, showed an enhanced antitumor
activity when exposed to the combination of selumetinib and
AZD8055 compared with monotherapies alone (P < 0.005 for
both models when the combination group was compared with
either monotherapy; Table 1).

Combining selumetinib and AZD8055 leads to enhanced
antitumor efﬁcacy in KRAS mutant human NSCLC
xenograft models
To test the efﬁcacy of combining selumetinib and AZD8055
in vivo, we selected a panel of KRAS mutant NSCLC human
tumor xenograft models. The panel included models that
displayed exquisite monotherapy sensitivity to selumetinib
(CaLu-6) or AZD8055 (A549 Fig. 1A and Table 1). The combination of selumetinib and AZD8055 signiﬁcantly enhanced
antitumor efﬁcacy in both models compared with monotherapies (P < 0.0005 in all cases for both models, except AZD8055 Vs
combination in the A549 model P < 0.005). In the CaLu-6 and
A549 models, the combination efﬁcacy resulted in tumor
regressions with tumor growth inhibitions (TGI) of 110%
(P < 0.0005) and 112% (P < 0.0005), respectively, compared

Combining selumetinib and AZD8055 inhibits the MAPK
and AKT/mTOR signaling in the CaLu-6 xenografts
To investigate the pharmacodynamic effect of combining
selumetinib and AZD8055 in vivo, animals bearing CaLu-6
tumors were exposed to an acute dosing schedule (one day
of dosing) of either vehicle, monotherapy agents, or the combination schedule. Tumor lysates were assessed for expression
of downstream pathway biomarkers of the MEK1/2 and AKT/
mTOR pathways. In tumors treated with selumetinib alone a
lower ratio of phospho to total proteins was observed for
pERK1/2 (16%; P < 0.0005), pS6 (46%; P < 0.0005), and p4EBP1 (48%; P < 0.005) compared with the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, selumetinib alone resulted in a
small increase in pAKT (119%; P < 0.05) in CaLu-6 tumors, and

this was also observed in HCT-116 xenografts (Figs. 1B and 2B)
and has been previously reported in studies using MEK1/2
inhibitors (36, 37). Tumors exposed to AZD8055 alone showed
lower expression of pAKT (45%; P < 0.05), pS6 (71%; P < 0.005),
and p4E-BP1 (28%; P < 0.005) compared with the vehicletreated group (Fig. 1B). AZD8055, whether as a single agent
or in combination with selumetinib, caused an increase in
pERK1/2 levels compared with vehicle or selumetinib alone,
respectively. This is probably because of inhibition of PI3K
signaling pathway leading to a release of negative feedback on
the MAPK pathway as previously reported (21). When selumetinib and AZD8055 were combined, the levels of pERK1/2
and pAKT were observed to decrease compared with vehicletreated tumors (Fig. 1B), suggesting that downstream markers
for either pathway can be inhibited simultaneously in the
CaLu-6 xenograft model. Interestingly, lower levels of 4E-BP1
were seen in the combination-treated tumors (16.9%) compared with monotherapies (47.7% in selumetinib and 28.7% in
AZD8055); however, this was not statistically signiﬁcant.

Selumetinib combined with AZD8055 induced apoptosis
in CaLu-6 xenografts
In view of the enhanced regression seen in the combinationtreated tumors, we investigated the expression of apoptotic
biomarkers in the tumors following treatments. In both the
selumetinib and AZD8055 monotherapy groups there was an
increase in the level of cleaved PARP compared with the
vehicle-treated group (P > 0.05 for AZD8055 and was not
signiﬁcant; Fig. 1C and D). However, in tumor tissue taken
from animals dosed with the combination of selumetinib and
AZD8055, an increase in cleaved PARP was observed that was
greater than that in either monotherapy group (Fig. 1C and
D). In addition, in tumors treated with selumetinib or
AZD8055 alone, a small increase in Bim-EL compared with
the vehicle group was observed (P > 0.05 for AZD8055 and
was not signiﬁcant; Fig. 1C and D). In tumors that had
received the combination of both agents, an increase of BimEL was shown to be approximately 4-fold and approximately
2-fold greater than the vehicle- and monotherapy-treated

www.aacrjournals.org

groups, respectively. Furthermore, a phosphorylation shift
was observed in the control- and AZD8055-treated tumors,
but this was not observed in the selumetinib and combination groups consistent with published observations that
activation of Erk1/2 promotes Bim phosphorylation (refs. 38,
39; Fig. 1C).
Combination of selumetinib and AZD8055 in KRAS
mutant colorectal xenografts
To determine the utility of combining selumetinib and
AZD8055 in other types of cancer we investigated the effect
of the combination in KRAS mutant human CRC xenograft
models (LoVo and HCT-116). In LoVo xenografts the combination of selumetinib and AZD8055 resulted in a 93% (P <
0.0005) TGI compared with 43% (P < 0.0005) for selumetinib
and 66% (P < 0.0005) in AZD8055-treated tumors (Table 2). In
HCT-116 xenografts, selumetinib and AZD8055 as monotherapies showed enhanced TGI compared with the control of 59%
(P < 0.0005) and 24% (P < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 2A). In
combination the compounds resulted in a TGI of 89% (P <
0.0005) compared with the vehicle-treated group. Statistical
analysis showed that there was a signiﬁcant difference between
the efﬁcacies observed in the monotherapy verses the combination groups.
Pharmacodynamic analysis of combining selumetinib
and AZD8055 in HCT116 xenografts
After a chronic dosing schedule (14 doses) tumor tissue from
HCT116 xenografts treated with vehicle, monotherapies, or the
combination of both compounds was processed and levels of
the primary biomarkers pERK1/2, pAKT, and pS6 were
assessed. In tumors from animals dosed with selumetinib a
reduction in pERK1/2 (21%) and pS6 (43%) were observed (Fig.
2B). AZD8055 alone resulted in lower levels of pAKT (41%) and
pS6 (36%). In tumors from animals that had received the
concurrent combination of selumetinib and AZD8055, levels
of all key biomarkers were lower compared with the vehicletreated control pERK1/2 (21%), pS6 (6%), and pAKT (43%; Fig.
2B). Interestingly, the reduction in pS6 in the combination

although this was not signiﬁcant.
To assess the mechanism of interaction between selumetinib and AZD8055 IHC analysis was done on the tumor tissue to
assess levels of the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase 3. Quan-

titative analysis did not show an increase in this marker in
selumetinib or AZD8055 monotherapy groups compared with
the vehicle (Fig. 2C). However, when the 2 compounds were
combined an increase in cleaved caspase 3 of approximately
150% (P < 0.05) compared with the monotherapy groups was
observed. Taken together the data presented here suggest that
combined inhibition of the MEK and mTOR pathways results
in enhanced antitumor efﬁcacy due to an increase in apoptosis.
Concurrent combination of selumetinib and AZD8055 in
a KRAS wild-type patient-derived NSCLC xenograft
model shows antitumor efﬁcacy and apoptosis
We then investigated whether the enhanced efﬁcacy of the
selumetinib/AZD8055 combination was seen in a model without a KRAS mutation. To test this we used a patient-derived
NSCLC xenograft model, L004, which is wild-type for KRAS and
EGFR. Selumetinib and AZD8055 were administered daily
following the same study protocol as described previously.
After 20 days of dosing, TGI was 48% (P < 0.005) and 87% (P <
0.0005) in response to selumetinib and AZD8055, respectively
(Fig. 3A). In the combination group TGI was observed to be
113% (P < 0.0005), suggesting tumor regression compared with
the vehicle-treated animals. Statistical analysis showed a signiﬁcant difference between the monotherapy groups and the
combination.
The effect of combining selumetinib and AZD8055 in the
L004 KRAS wild-type model was investigated pharmacodynamically. In tumors exposed to selumetinib alone, levels of
pERK1/2 were reduced to 22% compared with the vehicletreated group. Furthermore, lower levels of pS6 (65%), p4E-BP1
(69%), and pAKT (85%) were observed. When mTOR was
inhibited by AZD8055 reduction in levels of pAKT (19%), pS6
(14%), and p4E-BP1 (17%) were observed compared with the
vehicle. Interestingly, as seen in the CaLu-6 model in xenograft
tissue from animals treated with AZD8055, pERK1/2 levels
were observed to be increased to 174% compared with the
vehicle-treated tissues. However, this was not observed in the
combination group as pERK1/2 levels were reduced to 42%
compared with the vehicle, suggesting that inhibition of the
MEK pathway by selumetinib had repressed the upregulation
observed in xenograft tissue from animals treated with
AZD8055. The combination enhanced suppression of pS6
(6%) and p4E-BP1(7%) levels compared with monotherapies,
as previously observed in the CaLu-6 model.
To investigate the potential mechanism of action when
selumetinib and AZD8055 were combined in this model, levels
of the apoptotic markers, cleaved PARP, and Bim were analyzed and showed enhanced levels in the combination group
compared with the vehicle- and monotherapy-treated groups
(Fig. 3C).

genetic diversity and therefore may represent better models of
clinical disease (40). Therefore to investigate further the effects
of selumetinib and AZD8055 we conducted combination therapy in 3 CRC explants, chosen because of their varied morphology and genetics.
In the TC-305 model animals were exposed to 25 mg/kg
selumetinib and/or 10 mg/kg AZD8055. As monotherapies
selumetinib and AZD8055 showed antitumor efﬁcacy of 32%
(P < 0.05) and 50% (P < 0.0005), respectively, compared with the
vehicle-treated group. When both agents were administered in
concurrent combination, there was a signiﬁcant enhancement
of antitumor efﬁcacy of 73% (P < 0.0005; Fig. 4 and Table 2).
Statistical analysis showed presence of a signiﬁcant difference
between the monotherapy and combination groups. The combination efﬁcacy was also observed in 2 other CRC explant
models TC-71 and TC-302 (Table 2), in which monotherapies
had a moderate effect on antitumor activity.
Gene expression proﬁling of xenografts exposed to
selumetinib and AZD8055
To build on our understanding about the effect of combining
selumetinib and AZD8055 on proximal and phenotypic biomarkers, we wanted to determine whether inhibiting these
pathways in combination correlated with functional transcriptional pathway outputs. Gene expression analysis by real-time
quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR for an 18-gene signature, which has been reported to identify MEK functional
output independent of tumor type (41), was done on xenograft
tissue following exposure to the combination or monotherapy
agents in 3 of our xenograft models (CaLu-6, HCT-116, and
LoVo).
Several genes, which had a P value less than 0.05 and a fold
change of at least 1.4, in all 3 xenograft models tested decreased
in response to selumetinib, compared with vehicle, (DUSP4,
DUSP6, and ETV4; Fig. 5). Other genes were modulated in at
least 2 of the models (ETV5, MAP2K3, SLCO4A1, and SPRY2), or
in the CaLu-6 (LZTS1, PHLDA1, and TRIB2), or the HCT-116
(SERPINB1) models alone. Tumors exposed to AZD8055 did
not seem to have a signiﬁcant effect on the gene signature apart

from DUSP4, which increased (P < 0.05 and more than 1.4-fold
change) in response to mTOR inhibition in the CaLu-6 and
HCT-116 models. In addition, an increase in dual-speciﬁcity
phosphatase 6 (DUSP6; P < 0.05 and more than 1.4-fold change)
and SLCO4A1 (P < 0.05 and more than 1.4-fold change) and a
decrease in LZTS1 (P < 0.05 and more than 1.4-fold change) was
observed in HCT-116 xenografts. The general observation in
the combination groups was that similar gene changes were
seen to those of the selumetinib monotherapy indicating that
AZD8055 was not adding to or inhibiting the functional output
from selumetinib.

Discussion
In recent years numerous agents targeting the Ras/Raf/MEK
or PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways have entered clinical development, and dual targeting of these pathways is now been
investigated clinically. It had been generally accepted, and
shown, that direct inhibition of targets subject to mutational
activation is effective (42), and this expectation has to some
extent translated to cases in which the mutationally activated
pathway is targeted at a nonmutated node (e.g., MEK inhibitors
and Rapalogues). However, in some settings these initial
observations have been shown to be more complicated, and
the dependency of cancer cells for survival on both of these
pathways is becoming better understood (25, 27, 43). In this
study we report that dual targeting of the MEK and mTOR
pathways, using well-tolerated schedules of the inhibitors
selumetinib and AZD8055, respectively, results in enhanced
antitumor efﬁcacy across a panel of NSCLC and CRC xenograft
and patient-derived explant models. Furthermore, pharmacodynamic analysis of tumor tissue taken from several of these
studies showed MAPK and mTOR pathway suppression,
enhanced apoptotic signaling, and the modulation of MEK
functional output pathways following exposure to both agents.
Our initial investigations determined the efﬁcacy of combining selumetinib and AZD8055 across a panel of NSCLC and
CRC human tumor xenograft and explant models. There was a
consistent observation that combining selumetinib and

exquisitely sensitive to selumetinib (Tables 1 and 2). We also
tested the combination in a KRAS wild-type setting, the L004
NSCLC explant model, which showed the signiﬁcant beneﬁcial
effects of the combination (Fig. 3). We explored a wide variety
of models with differing genetic backgrounds and monotherapy response rates to try and understand the dependency of the
combination on cellular pathway signaling and potential
escape routes and feedback mechanisms (24, 44, 45). A recent
study highlighted the issue of feedback loops between the
MAPK and PI3K pathways following a prolonged exposure to
single agents targeting either pathway alone (21). This article
described that in RTK-activated or KRAS mutant cell lines,
when inhibitors speciﬁc for the individual pathways were
administered in combination, the reciprocal pathway activation was overcome and resulted in an increase in apoptosis and
tumor shrinkage in xenograft models. Given the existence and
complexity of mutations to these 2 pathways, it has been
suggested that in some cases combined inhibition of both
pathways maybe required to restore sensitivity to MEK inhibition, such as that shown when PIK3CA mutations were
ablated (28). Investigations into the exposure of transgenic
mice harboring murine lung cancers with either PIK3CA
H1047R or KRAS G12D mutations to the PI3K/mTOR agent
NVP-BEZ235 showed that as a monotherapy the agent was
effective in PIK3CA mutant lung cancers, but not against KRAS
mutations (25). However, when combined with selumetinib,
NVP-BEZ235 was more effective than either agent alone.
As part of our pharmacodynamic studies, we observed in
several models a small, although not statistically signiﬁcant
(P < 0.05), increase in pAKT in response to MEK inhibition with
selumetinib, an observation which has also been recently
reported in melanoma cell lines (36). Consistent with our
ﬁndings Gopal and colleagues showed that inhibition of AKT,

including the use of AZD8055, in combination with selumetinib was able to induce synergistic cell killing. Interestingly
this was not observed when selumetinib was combined with
the mTORC1 targeting agent rapamycin. This is likely to
be because rapamycin, unlike AZD8055, does not inhibit the
mTORC2 feedback loop and consequently AKT will still
be phosphorylated and the pathway active and/or that only
a partial inhibition of mTORC1 is achieved.
Inhibition of mTORC2 leads to dephosphorylation of AKT
(473) and a rapid, yet transient, inhibition of AKT phosphorylation (308; ref. 46). A recent report has described an observation that mTOR inhibition, by AZD8055, relieves feedback
inhibition of RTKs resulting in PI3K activation and subsequent
rephosphorylation of AKT (308) which is sufﬁcient enough to
reactivate AKT activity and signaling (47). In human tumor
xenograft models this observation is only made when AZD8055
was administered at doses greater than 50 mg/kg every day. In
context, the work presented here uses doses that do not exceed
20 mg/kg every day. This dosing regime was well tolerated in
mice and translates clinically to the equivalent maximum-

www.aacrjournals.org

tolerated dose of 90 mg twice daily, which has recently been
reported for AZD8055 (48). Furthermore, we have addressed
the notion that chronic administration is required to see these
feedback effects (see HCT116 pharmacodynamic data Fig. 2B);
we do not see a recovery of the AKT (473) signal to control
values in the AZD8055-treated group. It is also possible that
apparent differences between our data and those presented by
Rodrik-Outmezguine are not only related to the dose but also
tumor background. In their report they have used the BT474
breast cancer model which has a strong RTK "drive" via the
erbB family and these receptors seem to be the target of the
feedback. The tumor models that we have used are not notably
erbB family RTK driven.
Across several of our models we showed a reduction in
proximal biomarkers in response to the associated monotherapy and in the combination groups. Our group and others have
previously shown that a phenotypic response to MEK inhibition does not accurately track with the extent of inhibition of
ERK phosphorylation (36, 41, 49). As part of this study we
wanted to use a MEK functional activation signature (41) to
determine the functional output of the MEK pathway in
response to the combination of selumetinib and AZD8055.
We were able to show that a number of genes in the signature
decreased in response to the combination of selumetinib and
AZD8055, consistent with observations that selumetinib had
also reduced levels of these genes. At the time points assayed in
this study, one gene, DUSP6, was observed to change signiﬁcantly in response to dual targeting of these agents in all 3
models tested. DUSP6 is a negative regulator of the MAPK
family associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation
(49). In addition the response of the gene signature output to
AZD8055 did not seem to signiﬁcantly change, suggesting that
the increases in pERK we observed in response to AZD8055
(Figs. 1B and 3B) did not seem to effect MEK functional output,
further highlighting that some caution is required when interpreting pERK data (36).
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways converge on the
proapoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) family of proteins which
regulate apoptosis (50). Mechanistically a consistent observation from our studies was an increase in apoptosis in the
combination group compared with the single-agent treatment
groups. In the 3 models analyzed pharmacodynamically (CaLu6, HCT-116 and L004), there were increases in the downstream
apoptotic effectors cleaved caspase 3 and/or cleaved PARP.
The induction of apoptosis when the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathways are both inhibited has been frequently
observed across a number of genetic subtypes (21, 43, 51).
Furthermore, a number of in vitro studies have shown that
increases in the proapoptotic protein Bim is observed following combination therapy (26, 52). In our studies we wanted to
evaluate this mechanistic observation in our in vivo models.
Here we have shown that in the CaLu-6 xenograft and L004
NSCLC explant models Bim levels were greater in the combination group than that of the monotherapy. In response to
selumetinib and the combination treatment a dephosphorylation of Bim was seen, consistent with the mechanistic
rationale of MEK pathway inhibition. Several in vitro studies
have shown that in response to MEK inhibition alone or in

Holt et al.

combination with PI3K/AKT/mTOR agents, that Bim, along
with other BH3 proteins, mediates the observed apoptotic
response (43, 52, 53). Therefore the observations in our studies
suggest that Bim may be contributing to the apoptotic
response.
Further studies in vitro have been able to dissect the effects
of dual inhibition on the signaling of BH3 family proteins. A
recent study in AML showed a decrease in Mcl-1 following
combined treatment with the PI3K/AKT inhibitor perifosine
and MEK inhibitors PD184352 or U0126 (52). In our tumor
tissue we did assess Mcl-1 levels but did not detect any
difference in any of the treatment groups compared with the
controls (data not shown); this might reﬂect a cell type or time
dependence for Mcl-1 modulation by MEK inhibition that is
different from the effects of Bim.
In summary, we have presented a detailed preclinical evaluation, in human tumor xenograft and patient-derived tumor
xenograft models with a range of genetic backgrounds, showing that the combination of selumetinib and AZD8055 is more
effective than either agent alone. We have been able to present
detailed phamacodynamic proﬁling showing that MEK functional outputs, as well as primary biomarkers, are modulated in
response to the dual therapy. The use of several patient-derived

tumor xenograft models has enabled us to monitor the combination of selumetinib and AZD8055 in tumor tissue considered to have a greater histologic and genetic heterogeneity
than cell line–derived xenografts. Taken together the work
presented here suggests that the combination of selumetinib
and AZD8055 is a promising therapeutic strategy and warrants
further preclinical and clinical investigation to determine an
optimal setting for clinical testing.
