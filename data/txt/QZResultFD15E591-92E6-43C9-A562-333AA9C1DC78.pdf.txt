Abstract
Although DNA hypermethylation within promoter CpG islands is highly correlated with tumorigenesis, it has
not been established whether DNA hypermethylation within a specific tumor suppressor gene (TSG) is sufficient
to fully transform a somatic stem cell. In this study, we addressed this question using a novel targeted DNA
methylation technique to methylate the promoters of HIC1 and RassF1A, two well-established TSGs, along with a
two-component reporter system to visualize successful targeting of human bone marrow–derived mesenchymal
stem cells (MSC) as a model cell system. MSCs harboring targeted promoter methylations of HIC1/RassF1A
displayed several features of cancer stem/initiating cells including loss of anchorage dependence, increased
colony formation capability, drug resistance, and pluripotency. Notably, inoculation of immunodeficient mice
with low numbers of targeted MSC resulted in tumor formation, and subsequent serial xenotransplantation and
immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of stem cell markers and MSC lineage in tumor xenografts.
Consistent with the expected mechanism of TSG hypermethylation, treatment of the targeted MSC with a DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor reversed their tumorigenic phenotype. To our knowledge, this is the first direct
demonstration that aberrant TSG hypermethylation is sufficient to transform a somatic stem cell into a fully
malignant cell with cancer stem/initiating properties. Cancer Res; 71(13); 4653–63. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
DNA methylation, a tightly regulated process during normal
development, frequently becomes dysregulated during disease
development including cancer (1–3). Although methylationinduced tumorigenesis has yet to be recapitulated experimen-

tally, during somatic cell proliferation, environmental and
extracellular signals can initiate changes in DNA methylation
that contribute to clonal selection, altered cellular behavior,
and ultimately tumorigenesis (4–6). Hypomethylation and/or
hypermethylation of specific loci, including tumor suppressor
loci, were strongly associated with transformation and carcinogenesis (7, 8), and genetic knockout of the DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), resulted in global hypomethylation and
tumorigenesis (9, 10). Although a causative role for altered
methylation at specific loci, particularly as an initiating neoplastic event, remains poorly understood, dormant stem cells,
either pre-existing in tissues or arising from somatic cells, may
play a role in cancer origin and prognosis (4). Furthermore,
because DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene
(TSG) has been documented in many cancers, and its spreading correlates with cancer progression (4), we hypothesized
that abnormal DNA hypermethylation can disrupt somatic
stem cell proliferation and differentiation, resulting in the
development of neoplasia.
To directly examine the effect of aberrant DNA methylation
on cellular physiology, we established a Targeted DNA Methylation method called "TDM" (11, 12), in which transfection
established an in vitro methylated DNA complementary to the
target gene promoter region initiated recruitment of DNMT to
the endogenous target loci. Consequently, DNMT-mediated
methylation spreads within the promoter region of the target
loci, ultimately silencing the target gene after cellular passages.

To monitor progression of TDM and cellular transformation,
we also developed a 2-component system (11, 12). The first
component consisted of regulation of tetracycline repressor
(Tet) expression by the cloned target promoter sequence. A
CMV promoter driving expression of a reporter (enhanced
green fluorescence protein or EGFP) comprised the second
component. A Tet repressor binding site, Tet operator, placed
between the CMV and the EGFP, regulated EGFP expression. In
the absence of DNA methylation, Tet expression was observed,
and the expression of EGFP was silenced. Induction of DNA
methylation silenced the Tet repressor and activated EGFP
expression, allowing us to observe progression of DNA methylation in a living cell. Furthermore, if target loci DNA methylation was sufficient to induce cellular transformation, an EGFPexpressing cell behaved like a tumor (11, 12). It was of interest to
use this system to initiate TDM in a somatic stem cell and
monitor the subsequent effects on cellular transformation.
Although spontaneous transformation of human mesenchymal
stem cells (MSC) in vitro was recently described (13, 14), genetic
disruptions of the p53 pathway, but not retinoblastoma (Rb),
was sufficient to transform a fat-derived MSC (15), supporting
the possibility that sarcoma could be initiated from MSC.
In the current study (work flow is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S1A), we aimed to test the hypothesis that
targeted DNA methylation is sufficient for cellular transformation, thus the promoter regions of HIC1 (hypermethylated
in cancer 1) and RassF1A (ras-associated family protein isoforms 1A), 2 TSGs reported to be frequently silenced by DNA
methylation in cancer (16–18), were cloned, methylated in
vitro, and then transfected into the MSCs, individually or
concurrently. HIC1 and RassF1A are involved in highly diverse,
interacting cellular networks (16, 19, 20), and their loss of
function could result in the recently described phenomenon of
oncogenic addiction through p53 pathway (5). We thus
hypothesized that hypermethylation of HIC1 and RassF1A
would not only to directly suppress their tumor suppressor
function but also disrupt multiple cellular networks resulting
in tumorigenesis and cancer progression.

Materials and Methods
MSC isolation and characterization
Human MSC isolation and culture were carried out as
described by Lee and colleagues (21). MSC expansion medium,
passages, and culture condition were as described by Hsiao
and colleagues (11).
In vitro DNA methylation
Four micrograms of PCR-amplified HIC1 and RassF1A
promoters were incubated with 20 units of CpG methyltransferase (New England BioLabs) at 37 C for 4 hours in the
presence of 160 mmol/L S-adenosylmethionine to induce
methylation.
Validation of in vitro DNA methylation
Methylated DNA showing resistance to methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (BstUI) indicated completed conversion (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Cy5 labelling of the HIC1 promoter fragment
HIC1 DNA was labeled with LabelIT tracker Reagents
(Mirus) according to the manufacturer's instruction.
Transfection
The methylated PCR products (0.4 mg) were denatured at
95 C and then transfected into 5  105 cells using DMRIE-C
(Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Unmethylated PCR products were transfected as control. Cells
were transfected three times at days 1, 3, and 5.
Semiquantitative real-time methylation-specific PCR
The semiquantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP)
experiment was conducted and products were quantified
according to the protocol described in Yan and colleagues
(22). Briefly, bisulfite-converted genomic DNAs (0.5 mg) were
subject to real-time PCR (RT-PCR) with methylation-specific
primers (Supplementary Table S2). The qMSP reactions were
carried out using the SYBR Green I PCR Kit (Toyobo) in an iQ5
Real-Time PCR instrument (Bio-Rad). Melting analysis was
conducted followed by all of the PCR reactions to ensure a
specific amplicon was generated. Col2A1 was used for standard curve construction and as loading control. Serial dilution
of Col2A1 amplified bisulfite-converted DNA was used to
generate standard curve. Methylation percentage was calculated as follows: (means of target gene)/(means of Col2A1);
fold change was calculated as follows: (TDM methylation
percentage)/(mock methylation percentage). Endogenous
and exogenous HIC1 promoters were discerned by the reverse
primers indicated in Supplementary Figures S1B and S3A.
Differential methylation hybridization
All procedures for the differential methylation hybridization
(DMH) microarray were conducted as described in Leu and
colleagues (18) using a human CpG island microarray (Agilent). Briefly, me_H&R-treated and control MSC genomic
DNAs were digested into small fragments and then ligated
with designed adaptors. Methylation-sensitive restriction
enzymes (BstUI and HpaII) were used to discriminate the
methylated and the unmethylated DNA fragments. Differences
in methylation status were then amplified by PCR using the
adaptor as primer. The amplicons from control and me_H&Rtransfected cells were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively
and then cohybridized onto the CpG microarray. After measuring the Cy3 and Cy5 intensity, the M value [M ¼ log2 (Cy5
intensity/Cy3 intensity)] was used to indicate the difference in
DNA methylation between 2 sources, and the L value [L ¼ 0.5
 log2 (Cy5  Cy3)] was used to indicate the intensity of
individual loci. Both values were adjusted and normalized by
LOWESS. A cutoff value of 4 based on the M value was used to
identify the target loci.
Immunostaining
Cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde/PBS, then permeabilized with 0.5% NP40/PBS. After blocked with horse serum/
PBS (1:100), the slides were incubated with primary antibody
in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS followed by 3 times
of PBS washes. The cells were incubated with secondary

antibodies conjugated with Fluorescein or Texas Red (Vector
Lab) in 3% BSA/PBS. After several PBS washes, the slides were
mounted in mounting medium with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Lab). The primary antibodies used were
as follows: anti-HIC1 (Millipore), anti-RassF1A (Bioscience),
anti-CD133 (Abcam), anti-Oct4 (Cell Signaling), and anti-Neuronal nuclei (NeuN; Chemicon).

Semiquantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA isolation, first-strand cDNA synthesis, and detection of the transcripts were carried out as described (18).
Briefly, total RNA (2 mg) was reverse transcribed using the
SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The semiquantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was then carried out by SYBR
Green I PCR Kit (Toyobo) in an iQ5 Real-Time PCR instrument
(Bio-Rad). A serial dilution of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-amplified cDNA was used as control
to generate standard curve and GAPDH from each samples
was used as loading control. The primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2.

5-Aza-dc-20 -deoxycytidine treatment
Control and me_H&R transfected MSCs were treated with
20 mmol/L (Fig. 1) or 5 mmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S6D) of 5aza-dc-20 -deoxycytidine (5-aza-dc) or an equal final volume of
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 5 consecutive days.
Cloning of the human HIC1 and RassF1A promoters
Primer sequences for human HIC1 and RassF1A promoters
are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Genomic DNA purified
from human MSCs served as a template for PCR. Purified PCR
products were ligated into the pyT&A cloning vector (Yeastern
Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Inserts
were confirmed by restriction digests and sequencing. Cloning

Cell survival assay
In 96-well plates, 20 mL of MTT solution (Sigma-Aldrich; 5
mg/mL) was added to each well containing different number
of cells and incubated at 37 C for 5 hours. The reaction was

terminated by adding 200 mL of DMSO, and absorbance was
measured at 595 nm.
Soft agar assay
Cells were plated at a density of 5  104 per well in soft agar.
After 2 weeks of culture, cells were stained with 0.01% crystal
violet, and the number of spheres (>50 cells) from each dish
was counted.
Transwell study
Cells were plated at a density of 5  104 per well into the
hanging cell culture insert (Millipore), and the redistribution
of the cells on the other side of the insert was observed,
stained, and quantified.
In vivo tumorigenesis and serial transplantation of
xenografts
Six-week-old nude mice (Narl: ICR-Foxn1nu) were inoculated subcutaneously with 1  104me_H&R-transfected or
control MSCs. Growth of tumours was monitored until they
reached 0.8 cm in diameter. Then, tumors were surgically
removed and subcultured in MSC medium on low attachment
plates until spheres were observed again. The same number
of subcultured cells was inoculated into a new nude mouse,
and the entire procedure (n ¼ 9) was repeated 4 more times
(n ¼ 36 in total).
Immunohistochemistry
Tumor masses surgically removed from nude mice inoculated with me_H&R-transfected MSCs were paraffin
embedded and sectioned at 4 mm or embedded in optimum
cutting temperature (OCT) and sectioned on a cryostat (Leica)
at 12 mm. Sections were stained with the indicated antibodies,
and detection was carried out with Vectastain (Vector Lab) for
the paraffin sections and Fluorescein- or Texas red–conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (Vector Lab) for the cryosections, followed by DAPI staining. Sections were also stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; Vector Lab) for pathologic
exams.
Lineage-specific induction of MSCs
Transfected MSCs (mock or me_H&R) were plated onto 6well plates at 5  104 cells per well. After attachment, the
medium was replaced with neuronal preinduction medium
[Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) with 20% FBS, 10
ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and 1 mmol/L
b-mercaptoethanol] for 24 hours, followed by neuronal induction medium [DMEM with 100 mmol/L butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), 10 mmol/L forskolin, 2% DMSO, 25 mmol/L KCl,
2 mmol/L valproic acid, 1  B27 supplement, 10 ng/mL bFGF,
10 ng/mL platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)]. Morphologic changes and NeuN expression were used to validate
neuronal induction. Osteocyte induction medium consisted
of DMEM, 10% FBS, 10 mg/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 100
nmol/L dexamethasone, 10 mmol/L b-glycerophosphate, and
50 mmol/L L-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate. Cells were treated
with the osteocyte induction medium for 10 days and then
subject to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich) staining.

Construction of two-component reporter system
The construction of HIC1 2-component reporter system is
described and illustrated in Supplementary Figure S4. Both
constructs were sequence validated and used to transfect the
MSCs and transfected cells were selected with hygromycin
and G418 resistance. PCR were carried out to validate the
integrations of both constructs (HIC1-TR and EG1; Supplementary Fig. S4B). MSC clones carrying both reporter constructs were treated with doxycycline (Supplementary
Fig. S4B). Doxycycline-induced EGFP expression indicates
the reporter system is functional.
Human subjects
Isolation and characterization of human MSCs were conducted under Institutional Review Board (IRB) regulations of
the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.
Animals
The use of mice followed the regulations and protocols
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at the National Chung Cheng University.

Results
Targeted HIC1 and RassF1A methylation transforms
MSCs
In vitro methylated (validation of in vitro methylation is
shown in Supplementary Fig. S2) or unmethylated (control)
HIC1 and RassF1A promoter DNA fragments were transfected
into human bone marrow–derived MSCs mixed population
(MSC_MP) alone or in combination. Transfection of methylated HIC1 (me_HIC1) or methylated RassF1A (me_RassF1A)
increased endogenous HIC1 or RassF1A promoter methylation, as detected by qMSP (Fig. 1A, top). MSP amplification
was confirmed by sequencing in Supplementary Fig. S3A and
B) and the expression of endogenous HIC1 or RassF1A
decreased accordingly, as detected by immunostaining
(Fig. 1A, bottom). TDM was confirmed by bisulfite sequencing
(Supplementary Fig. S3C and D).
Loss of contact inhibition was used as a screening criterion
for MSC transformation (Fig. 1B, left). Transfection and selection of transformed MSCs are illustrated in Supplementary
Figure S6A. Cotransfection of methylated HIC1 and RassF1A
(me_H&R) caused formation of anchorage-independent aggregates, similar to the transformed phenotype in attached
cultures, whereas the controls and cells transfected with
either me_HIC1 or me_RassF1A alone remained contact inhibited (Fig. 1B, left middle two). When cultured in low attachment dishes, both methylated- and mock-transfected MSCs
formed spherical aggregates (Fig. 1B, right), suggesting that
these me_H&R transfected MSCs retained their self-renewal
property.
To confirm that loss of anchorage dependence was due to
DNA hypermethylation, cells were treated with the DNMT
inhibitor 5-aza-dc. 5-Aza-dc treatment decreased the hypermethylation level of endogenous HIC1 and RassF1A in the
me_H&R-transfected MSCs (Fig. 1C and Supplementary
Fig. S6D) and abrogated the formation of me_H&R-induced

aggregates (Fig. 1D, right and Supplementary Fig. S6D,
top). These data indicate that DNA hypermethylation
of both HIC1 and RassF1A potentially transformed somatic
MSCs and rendered them anchorage independent. More-

over, the requirement for methylation of both HIC1
and RassF1A for MSC transformation supports the notion
that cancer initiation and development is a multistep
process.

the MSC nuclei. EGFP was detected in these Cy5-containing/
transfected MSC (Fig. 2B, columns 3, 7, 8). When me_HIC1 was
used to transfect the cells, qMSP analysis further showed
increased methylation of exogenous HIC1 promoter (HIC1TR; Fig. 2C, left), and EGFP expression increased accordingly
(Fig. 2C, right). The me_RassF1A, RassF1A, or control
(unmethylated) HIC1 DNAs failed to induce the EGFP expression, further indicating that we successfully and specifically
methylated the HIC1 promoter. Targeted HIC1 methylation
had no effect on the methylation state of the endogenous
RassF1A promoter and vice versa (Fig. 2D), consistent with our
previous report that the TDM is locus-specific (11, 12). Combined transfection of me_HIC1 and me_RassF1A resulted in
methylation of both endogenous loci, as determined by qMSP
(Fig. 2D, left), as well as concomitant silencing of both genes
(qRT-PCR; Fig. 2D, right). Data from the 2-component reporter
system further confirmed that our targeting method caused
gene silencing at the transcriptional level and that aberrant
DNA methylation of both HIC1 and RassF1A might transform

Validation of TDM by two-component reporter system
To confirm that the TDM caused silencing at the transcriptional level and induced aggregates within the targeted cells,
we used a 2-component reporter system (11, 12) to mark and
track methylation-mediated silencing of the HIC1 promoter in
live cells (single colonies, SC). In this system, the HIC1
promoter regulates expression of the EGFP reporter construct
(Fig. 2A flow diagram on left; reporter system construction is
illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S4). Methylation of the HIC1
promoter alone did not result in phenotypic changes but
caused HIC1 promoter silencing, as indicated by increased
EGFP expression (Fig. 2A, right middle). However, concomitant methylation of RassF1A and HIC1 led to cell aggregates
containing EGFP-expressing (i.e., HIC1 silenced) cells (Fig. 2A,
right and Supplementary Fig. S6B and C).
To track the distribution of transfected DNAs, me_HIC1
construct was labeled with Cy5 prior to transfection. Cy5

functions associated with HIC1 and RassF1A (16, 19, 24), it was
not surprising to observe global changes in the MSC methylome. Furthermore, as both HIC1 and RassF1A were reported
to function as TSGs that act via p53, we conducted unsupervised ontological analysis of the array target loci and found
that p53 and its associated signaling components were significantly altered by me_H&R transfection (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S7, target loci with the p53 binding domain are
listed in Supplementary Table S3). Our finding that MSC
transformation is strongly associated with altered p53 function is consistent with a previous report using genetic
approaches (15).

normal somatic stem cells. Furthermore, our data indicated
that methylation of HIC1 initiated the accumulation of epigenetic changes in MSCs and increased the potential for
transformation. In normal cells, the transformation process
can be prohibited by gatekeepers or roadblocks, such as
RassF1A; thus, gatekeeper silencing can allow for excess cell
proliferation and/or genome corruption, increasing the probability of neoplastic transformation.
Transfection of me_H&R induces genome-wide DNA
methylation changes in MSC
To further investigate changes in DNA methylation following me_H&R targeting, genome-wide methylation profiling of
me_H&R-transfected and control MSCs was carried out using
DMH microarrays (23). As shown in the methylation heatmap,
transfection of me_H&R induced extensive disruption in the
MSC epigenome (Fig. 3A, left). Individual loci (Fig. 3A, right)
displaying hypermethylation (SOX7, ADAM9, and GATA6) or
hypomethylation (CXXC1, OSBP, and TBX2) were validated by
qMSP (Fig. 3B). On the basis of the wide range of cellular

were able to differentiate into neuron-like cells (Fig. 3D, right,
indicated by NeuN staining) and osteoblasts (Fig. 3D, left

that although concurrent methylation of HIC1 and RassF1A
TSGs was sufficient to transform MSCs, as indicated by altered
anchorage dependence and methylation patterns, the transformed MSCs retained somatic stem cell characteristics.

The proliferation and invasion capability of transformed

Methylated HIC1 and RassF1A Transformed MSCs

Expression of stem cell markers in me_H&R MSCderived tumors
We examined xenografts from serial transplantations for
expression of known stem cell markers by immunohistochemistry. As shown in Figure 5A, expression of CD44, CD133, and
Oct4 was observed, substantiating the CSC-like phenotype.
Vimentin expression was also detected, confirming the
mesenchymal origin of the xenografts. Clonal expression of
a panel of epithelial markers, including neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S-100, cytokeratin, desmin, and leukocyte common
antigen (LCA; Fig. 5B), further showed the ability of CSCs to
differentiate into heterogeneous tumors. In addition, expression of both stem cell (CD133) and mesenchymal (vimentin)
markers in sparsely scattered cells of me_H&R tumors showed
that the xenografts were derived from inoculated me_H&R
MSCs (Fig. 5C). Although we observed slight enrichment of
CD133þ/vimentinþ cells in serial transplantation experiments
(Supplementary Fig. S10A), the overall percentage remained
low, in agreement with previous observations (25) that CSCs
continue to form a small proportion of the overall tumor even
after in vitro enrichment and xenograft transplantation.

Supplementary Figs. S8B and S9B). Taken together, these
results indicated that MSCs with concurrent methylation of
HIC1 and RassF1A acquired a cancer phenotype.
Acquired drug resistance is a hallmark of malignancy and a
characteristic of a cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype. Cisplatin
treatment induced cell death in control MSCs in a dosedependent manner, but the drug was much less effective in
me_H&R-transfected MSCs, even at a very high dose (100
mmol/L; Fig. 4C), further indicating that concurrent HIC1 and
RassF1A methylation transformed normal somatic stem cells
into CSC like.
To examine the tumorigenic capacity of the me_H&Rtransfected MSCs in vivo, immunodeficient nude mice were
inoculated with me_H&R-treated MSCs. As shown in Figure
4D, 100% of these mice developed tumors (n ¼ 9), whereas the
mice inoculated with control MSCs remained tumor free.
Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of CD133þ stem
cells in the tumors (Fig. 4D, bottom left). Furthermore, the
tumors were soft tissue sarcomas like (Figs. 4D, right and 5A
and B), consistent with this type of malignancy in mice with
heterozygous disruption of HIC1 (17).

Teng et al.

Transformation specificity induced by concurrent
methylated of HIC1 and RassF1A
To establish that MSC transformation was due to concomitant methylation of HIC1 and RassF1A and not accumulation of targeted genes, we simultaneously methylated 9 genes
in the SWH signaling pathway by TDM in MSCs (ref. 20;
Fig. 6A). Abnormal SWH signaling pathway has been associated with tumorigenesis in both mammalian cells and
Drosophila (26, 27), and RassF1A is a SWH pathway component controlling cellular proliferation, survival, antiapoptosis,
organ size, and cell contact inhibition (20, 28). Because loss of
function of these 9 genes (Fig. 6A) has been reported in various
cancers (20), we hypothesized that methylation of these SWH
signaling pathway genes (i.e., "me_SWH") could cause MSC
transformation. me_SWH-treated MSCs displayed loss of contact inhibition (Fig. 6B), increased colony formation in soft
agar assays (Supplementary Fig. S9A), and were invasive in
Transwell assays (Supplementary Fig. S9B). Furthermore,
me_SWH-treated MSCs retained stemness markers and could
be induced to differentiate (Fig. 6C). However, these cells were
not tumorigenic in nude mice assay (Fig. 6D). Taken together,
these results support a unique role for the combination of
methylated HIC1 and RassF1A in MSC transformation.
Furthermore, increasing the number of methylated loci within
the SWH pathway did not result in transformation of MSC,
even though RassF1A was included in the me_SWH loci.
Collectively, our data showed that concurrent methylation
of HIC1 and RassF1A was sufficient to transform MSCs. The
observation that pluripotency was maintained suggests that
the cells had acquired a CSC phenotype. Increased proliferation is often accompanied with increased genetic and/or
epigenetic mutations (29), which further enhance transformation and clonal selection during mesenchymal-to-epithelial
transition (MET; refs. 30–32). In more permissive environments, including nude mice, subpopulations of inoculated
me_H&R produced NSE- and LCA-positive epithelial cells
(Fig. 5C) or other cell types (Supplementary Fig. S10B). The
acquired differentiation capacity, and perhaps later migratory
capability, may allow these CSC-like cells to either remain in
their original location or migrate to form secondary tumors
(Fig. 5D, bottom scheme). Bioinformatic analysis further
revealed the presence of p53 binding elements within the
targets identified by DMH (Supplementary Table S3), suggesting a central role for p53 in MSC oncogenic transformation.
The tumor suppressor activities of both HIC1 and RassF1A are
due, in part, to p53 activation, in agreement with previous
genetic findings (17). Concordant silencing of HIC1 and
RassF1A by DNA methylation may impair p53-mediated apoptosis and contribute to the tumorigenic ability of MSCs.

Discussion
Here, we elucidated the role of DNA methylation in the
transformation of somatic stem cells into CSC-like cells. Bone
marrow–derived MSCs are known to play important roles in
cancer progression and metastasis (33–35). By providing a
microenvironment that enhances primary tumor growth,
invasiveness, and metastasis, MSCs have the capacity to

4662

Cancer Res; 71(13) July 1, 2011

mobilize to other organs, providing a niche suitable for the
disseminated cancer cells to metastasize to distant tissues
(33). Our data show that in addition to these 2 supporting
roles, MSCs may play a previously unidentified role in tumorigenesis, as abnormal DNA hypermethylation of HIC1 and
RassF1A, 2 TSGs involved in functionally diverse, interacting
networks, transformed MSCs from normal somatic stem cells
to cancer-like stem cells.
Concordant methylation of HIC1 and RassF1A has been
identified in advanced ovarian cancer (36), and HIC1 shows
increased concurrent hypermethylation with other genes in
advanced myelodysplasia syndrome (37), suggesting that disturbance of HIC1-associated networks may be essential for
tumor initiation. Unlike RassF1A, which can be inactivated by
either genetic or epigenetic mechanisms, repression of HIC1 is
mainly caused by DNA methylation (16). Thus, DNA hypermethylation of HIC1 could predispose cells to cancer development (Fig. 2A). A second epigenetic hit, such as RassF1A
methylation, may then permit more efficient cancer development. However, it is also possible that hypermethylation of
RassF1A results in further epigenomic disturbances, rendering
a cell more susceptible to cancer-causing insult(s). Our data
further show that DNA methylation is a cause rather than a
consequence of malignancy, and p53 may be at the center of
this oncogenic transformation. p53-dependent apoptosis
plays an integral part in tumor growth, progression, and drug
resistance development (38), and the tumor suppressor ability
of both HIC1 and RassF1A is due to p53 activation. Thus,
concordant silencing of HIC1 and RassF1A by DNA methylation may synergistically disrupt the p53-mediated apoptotic
pathway and contribute to the observed tumorigenic ability of
MSCs.
The origin of CSCs or cancer-initiating cells has been
widely debated. These cells may arise either from deregulated somatic stem cells or from dedifferentiated mature
cells (4, 7, 8, 39–42). It has been reported that several
hypermethylated genes, including HIC1 and RassF1A, in
adult cancer are unmethylated in embryonic stem cells
and only partially methylated in embryonic carcinomas
(43). In this study, we show that forced epigenetic silencing
of HIC1 and RassF1A is sufficient to confer normal somatic
stem cells with malignant properties, including loss of contact inhibition, increased colony formation, migration capability, drug resistance, and tumor formation in inoculated
mice. Moreover, the cells retained sensitivity to neuron- and
osteocyte-induction and displayed both lineage-specific
markers and stem cell markers in xenografts. Thus, we
reason that methylation of both HIC1 and RassF1A triggers
the transformation of normal somatic stem cells to CSC-like
cells. As proposed in Figure 5D, this transition may promote
additional transforming events and further cellular selection. We further propose that under the influence of different environmental niches, these transformed stem cells
could give rise to tissue-specific cancers.
