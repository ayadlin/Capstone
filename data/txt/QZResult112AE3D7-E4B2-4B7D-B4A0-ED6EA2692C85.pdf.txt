Abstract
Helicobacter pylori infection causes severe dysplasia manifested as gastrointestinal intraepithelial neoplasia (GIN) after
28 weeks post–H. pylori infection (WPI) in cancer-prone,
hypergastrinemic male INS-GAS mice. We examined the
efficacy of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac
(400 ppm in drinking water) alone, the CCK2/gastrin receptor
antagonist YM022 (45 mg/kg/wk) alone, and sulindac or
YM022 combined with H. pylori eradication therapy to prevent
H. pylori–associated gastric cancer in male INS-GAS mice.
Treatments started at 22 WPI, and mice were euthanized at
28 WPI. In uninfected mice, all treatments significantly
delayed development of spontaneous GIN (P < 0.05). In
H. pylori–infected mice, sulindac alone or YM022 alone had
no protective effect on H. pylori–associated GIN. Importantly,
sulindac exacerbated the severity of H. pylori–associated
gastritis despite decreased gastric prostaglandin E2 levels.
However, sulindac combined with H. pylori antimicrobial
eradication reduced the incidence of GIN (P < 0.05), whereas
YM022 combined with antimicrobial eradication did not
reduce GIN. In infected mice, sulindac or YM022 treatment
did not alter gastric expression of the proinflammatory
cytokines Ifn-g and Tnf-a and mucosal cell proliferation.
Sulindac or YM022 combined with antimicrobial eradication
down-regulated mRNA levels of Ifn-g and Tnf-a and mucosal
cell proliferation (P < 0.05). We conclude that sulindac
enhances H. pylori gastritis and may promote inflammationmediated gastric carcinogenesis. The combination of sulindac
and antimicrobial H. pylori eradication was beneficial for
reducing proinflammatory cytokine mRNA in the stomach
and preventing progression from severe dysplasia to gastric
cancer in H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Based on experimental animal models and epidemiologic
evidence, Helicobacter pylori infection causes persistent chronic
gastritis, which in susceptible individuals may progress to atrophy,
intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and finally intestinal-type gastric

cancer (1–4). H. pylori infection resulted in overexpression of
cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) in primary gastric cancer and gastric
cancer cell lines of human and mouse gastric epithelial cells (5, 6).
Double-transgenic mice that constitutively expressed Cox-2 and
prostaglandin E synthase-1 (Pges-1) in gastric epithelial cells had
higher levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the stomach and
spontaneously develop macrophage infiltration, metaplasia, and
gastric adenocarcinoma. This Cox-2/PGE2–related gastric cancer
was suppressed by a Cox-2 inhibitor, NS-398 (7), suggesting that
Cox-2/PGE2 pathway may contribute to Helicobacter-associated
gastric carcinogenesis. Recent studies suggested a positive
association between hypergastrinemia, H. pylori infection, and
gastric cancer in humans and mice (8–11). Hypergastrinemia
and Helicobacter infection synergistically promoted gastric cancer
in male transgenic INS-GAS mice overexpressing amidated gastrin
(8, 9, 11). Because decades of H. pylori infection are a prerequisite
for gastric cancer development in susceptible hosts (1), chemoprevention is one of the promising approaches in gastric cancer
prevention.
Because overexpression of Cox-2 and production of PGE2 are
strongly associated with increased proliferation and reduced
apoptosis in gastrointestinal epithelial tumor cells (12), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) that inhibit Cox activities and
production of PGE2 are among the most widely tested compounds
for cancer chemoprevention (13, 14). Inhibition of Cox activities
decreased cell proliferation in gastric and intestinal cell lines that
constitutively expresses Cox-2 (15, 16). Animal models showed that
the nonselective Cox inhibitor sulindac prevents oral-esophageal
cancer and colon cancer (17, 18). Epidemiologic studies also
associate consumption of aspirin or other NSAIDs with a reduced
risk of colorectal cancer (19, 20). In addition, clinical trials
confirmed that sulindac and the selective Cox-2 inhibitor celecoxib
inhibit the number and growth of adenomatous polyps in patients
with familial adenomatous polyposis (21, 22). A lower risk of gastric
cancer has been associated with NSAIDs in a dose-dependent
manner (23). Considering the association between Cox-2/PGE2
pathway and Helicobacter -associated gastric carcinogenesis,
NSAIDs have been proposed as candidates for chemoprevention
of gastric cancer. However, recent data indicate that suppression of
PGE2 by Cox-2 inhibition enhanced Th1 proinflammatory immune
responses in H. pylori–infected humans (24, 25); this raises the
possibility that NSAIDs may increase H. pylori–associated gastritis
and enhance inflammation-mediated gastric carcinogenesis (2).
It also has been shown that long-term treatment of CCK2/
gastrin receptor antagonist YF476 prevented the development of
Helicobacter-associated gastric cancer in INS-GAS mice (26, 27),
suggesting that the gastrin signaling pathway provides another

potential target for cancer chemoprevention. However, the effect of
short-term CCK2/gastrin receptor antagonist treatment has not
been analyzed. Long-term treatment of sulindac did not cause
tissue injury of gastric mucosa of mice (18).4 A recent study showed
that gastric PGE2 in H. pylori infection was mainly derived from
Cox-1, and the selective Cox-2 inhibitor rofecoxib did not suppress
PGE2 production or gastric epithelial proliferation, biomarkers of
carcinogenesis (28).
We examined the chemopreventive effects of the nonselective
Cox inhibitor sulindac and CCK2/gastrin receptor antagonist
YM022 (29), an analogue of YF476 (26), alone or in combination
with H. pylori antimicrobial eradication during the chronic stage of
H. pylori infection in male INS-GAS mice.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Specific pathogen-free (including Helicobacter spp.) male INS-GAS
mice on a FVB/N background were maintained in an Association for
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care–accredited
facility housed in microisolator cages and given a commercial rodent diet
(Prolab 3000) and water ad libitum. The animal protocol was approved by
the MIT Committee on Animal Care.
Experimental design. Fifty-four 6- to 8-week-old male mice were
infected by oral gavage with 0.2 mL H. pylori (SS1 strain) on alternate days
for a total of three doses (30). The H. pylori inoculum was adjusted with PBS
to A 600 = 1.0 (30). Helicobacter-uninfected mice were sham-dosed with
0.2 mL PBS. Antimicrobial therapy used to eradicate H. pylori consisted of
omeprazole (400 Amol/kg/d; Sigma-Aldrich), metronidazole (14.2 mg/kg/d;
Sigma-Aldrich), and clarithromycin (7.15 mg/kg/d; Abbott) twice a day for
7 days. This regimen has been used successfully in eradicating H. pylori
from experimentally infected mice (31, 32). Antimicrobial H. pylori therapy
was administered at 22 weeks post–H. pylori infection (WPI). Sulindac was
dissolved in buffer (4 mmol/L Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) at the final concentration of
400 ppm, given ad libitum, and changed daily from 22 WPI (18). YM022 was
dissolved in polyethylene glycol 300 (Sigma) by stirring for 24 h at room
temperature, and 45 mg/kg was injected s.c. once a week starting at 22 WPI
(27). Mice were euthanized at 28 WPI.
Tissue collection and gastric pH measurement. Mice were fasted
overnight (8-14 h) before necropsy. Following CO2 asphyxiation, blood
was immediately collected by cardiac puncture. The stomach was clamped
at both esophageocardial and pyloroduodenal junctions. Sterile water
(1.5 mL) was injected into the stomach, the stomach was massaged gently,
and the pH of the aspirated gastric contents was measured using a pH
meter (Orion PerpHecT model 320; Thermo Scientific).
Histologic analysis. The stomach was incised along the greater
curvature. Linear gastric strips from the lesser curvature were fixed in
10% neutral-buffered formalin or 70% ethanol, embedded, cut at 4 Am, and
stained with H&E. Tissue sections were scored for gastric lesions using
previously published criteria by two veterinary pathologists (A.B.R. and B.R.)
blinded to sample identity (33). A dysplasia score of 3.0 was considered lowgrade gastrointestinal intraepithelial neoplasia (GIN). Dysplasia scores
equal or higher than 3.5 represented high-grade GIN (34). Ki-67
immunostaining (BD Biosciences) was used to measure epithelial
proliferation of gastric mucosa. The ratio of Ki-67–positive nuclei to total
epithelial nuclei in all glands of the proximal corpus was quantified
manually to ascertain the Ki-67 labeling index (LI), and results were
averaged from three to four mice per group.
Confirmation of H. pylori eradication by quantitative PCR.
A longitudinal strip of gastric tissue from the greater curvature was
digested with proteinase K at 55jC overnight followed by DNA extraction
with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and ethanol precipitation. H. pylori colonization levels in gastric tissue were quantified using

100 ng genomic DNA by a fluorogenic quantitative PCR assay with urease B
primers as described previously (35).
Determination of PGE2 in mouse gastric tissues. Frozen mouse
gastric tissue (30-50 mg) was ground to a fine powder using a liquid
nitrogen–cooled mortar (Fisher Scientific). Samples were then transferred
to sealed microcentrifuge tubes, and three times the volume of ice-cold PBS
containing 0.1% butylated hydroxytoluene (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mmol/L
EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. The sample was then homogenized by
an Ultrasonic Processor (Misonix) at 0jC for 3 min. An aliquot (100 AL) of
homogenate was transferred to a glass tube (13  100 mm) and subjected to
extraction of prostaglandins using a method described previously (36). The
results were expressed as ng PGE2/mg protein.
Quantitative analysis of mRNA expression. A longitudinal strip of
gastric tissue from the anterior wall was harvested and snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and then stored at 70jC. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from 5 Ag total RNA with
High-Capacity cDNA Archive kit. mRNA levels of Ifn-c, Tnf-a, Il-4, Cox-1 (or
Ptgs1; Applied Biosystems), Cox-2 (or Ptgs2 ), and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) were quantified with TaqMan gene
expression assays using an ABI Prism Sequence Detection System 7700
(Applied Biosystems). mRNA levels of each gene were normalized to the
mRNA level of internal control Gapdh and compared with the data of
uninfected mice using the DDCT method (User Bulletin 2; Applied
Biosystems).
Statistical analysis. Gastric lesion scores and Ki-67 LI for proliferation
indices were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. PGE2 levels,
expression levels of cytokines, and IgG titers were compared using the
Student’s t test. Incidences of low-grade and high-grade GIN in the
treatment groups were compared with controls by m2 test and Fisher’s exact
t test using commercial software (GraphPad Prism 4.0; GraphPad Software).
Data were presented as mean F SE.

Results
Effect of chemopreventive therapies on gastric pH in
uninfected and H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice. To assess the
effect of H. pylori infection with or without treatment on the gastric
acidity of INS-GAS mice, the pH of gastric aspirate was measured.
Untreated uninfected INS-GAS mice had a gastric pH 4.76 F 2.2.
Among H. pylori–uninfected mice, gastric pH was reduced by
sulindac (3.37 F 0.16; P < 0.001), and sulindac and antimicrobial
therapy also reduced gastric pH (3.85 F 0.38; P = 0.07;
Supplementary Fig. S1). Uninfected mice that received sulindac or
sulindac and antimicrobial therapy had comparable gastric pH
(P = 0.21). In contrast, uninfected mice that received gastrin receptor
antagonist YM022 or YM022 and antimicrobial therapy did not alter
gastric pH (4.72 F 0.25 and 4.59 F 0.2, respectively).
H. pylori infection and antimicrobial eradication were confirmed
by quantitative PCR at necropsy. H. pylori was successfully
eradicated in all mice (100%) that received antimicrobial therapy
at 22 WPI (data not shown). H. pylori infection significantly
increased the gastric pH in INS-GAS mice (6.28 F 0.12; P < 0.001).
Among H. pylori–infected mice, the gastric pH was reduced
by sulindac (4.96 F 0.22) and sulindac and antimicrobial therapy
(4.59 F 0.22; both P < 0.001). H. pylori–infected mice that received
sulindac or sulindac and antimicrobial therapy had a similar
gastric pH (P = 0.24). Infected mice that received YM022 had a
gastric pH (6.35 F 0.05) comparable with that in untreated infected
mice. However, YM022 and antimicrobial therapy reduced the
gastric pH (5.55 F 0.25) in infected mice when compared with
untreated infected mice (P = 0.07) or infected mice that received
YM022 (P < 0.01).
Sulindac and YM022 inhibit gastric preneoplasia in
uninfected INS-GAS mice. H. pylori–uninfected mice developed

developed high-grade GIN. Sulindac treatment started at ages 28
to 30 weeks (equivalent to 22 WPI) significantly reduced

premalignant lesions (P < 0.01) and incidence of gastric cancer
(P < 0.05) in uninfected mice (Fig. 2). Low-grade GIN was observed
in 10% of the uninfected INS-GAS mice that received sulindac,
whereas high-grade GIN was not diagnosed. Sulindac and

of the uninfected mice that received the combination of sulindac
and antimicrobial therapy developed GIN.
YM022 treatment slightly reduced dysplasia (P = 0.079) and the
incidence of gastric cancer (P = 0.087) in uninfected mice (Fig. 3).
Low-grade GIN was diagnosed in 25% of the YM022-treated
uninfected mice. YM022 and antimicrobial therapy resulted in less
severe dysplasia (P < 0.01) and incidence gastric cancer (P < 0.01) in
uninfected mice. Additionally, uninfected mice that received YM022
or the combination of YM022 and antimicrobial therapy had
comparable severity of gastric lesions (P > 0.05).
H. pylori infection promotes gastric carcinogenesis.
Helicobacter infection promotes gastric carcinogenesis in mice
(9, 11). H. pylori–infected mice developed more severe gastric
inflammation (P = 0.065) and epithelial defects (P < 0.01) than
uninfected mice (Fig. 2). H. pylori infection also promoted the
development of gastric cancer in all infected mice.
Sulindac increases gastric preneoplasia, whereas sulindac
and antimicrobial therapy reduces gastric carcinogenesis in
H. pylori–infected mice. In H. pylori–infected mice, sulindac
exacerbated the severity of inflammation (P < 0.01), oxyntic
atrophy (P < 0.05), and intestinal metaplasia (P < 0.05; Figs. 1C and
2). Epithelial hyperplasia was reduced by sulindac (P < 0.01; data
not shown). The severity of dysplasia and the incidence of gastric
cancer were comparable between untreated infected mice and
infected mice that received sulindac. All infected mice that received
sulindac developed gastric cancer with both low-grade and highgrade GIN being observed in a H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice
(80% and 20%, respectively). Compared with untreated H. pylori–
infected mice, infected mice that received sulindac and antimicrobial therapy had significantly less severe oxyntic atrophy (P < 0.05)
and a lower incidence of gastric cancer (P < 0.05; Figs. 1D and 2).
Gastric cancer was observed in 64% (38% high-grade and 27%

low-grade GIN) of infected mice that received sulindac and
antimicrobial therapy. The severity of inflammation, epithelial
defects, hyperplasia, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia were
comparable between untreated infected mice and infected mice
that received sulindac and antimicrobial therapy. Additionally,
when compared with H. pylori–infected mice that received
sulindac, severity of inflammation (P < 0.001), oxyntic atrophy
(P < 0.001), and intestinal metaplasia (P < 0.01) and incidence of
gastric cancer (P < 0.01) were significantly reduced in infected mice
that received the combination therapy.
Compared with untreated H. pylori–infected mice, infected
mice that received YM022 or a combination of YM022 and
antimicrobial therapy showed similar pathology scores (Fig. 3).
Gastric cancer developed in all mice that received YM022 and
antimicrobial therapy. Low-grade and high-grade GIN were
observed in 75% and 25% of infected mice that received YM022
and in 44% and 56% of infected mice that received YM022
and antimicrobial therapy, respectively. YM022 or YM022 and
antimicrobial therapy had no significant effect on gastric cancer
incidence in H. pylori–infected mice.
Expression of proinflammatory Ifn-g and Tnf-a, Cox-1, and
Cox-2 in the stomach is up-regulated by sulindac but downregulated by sulindac and antimicrobial therapy. Among
H. pylori–uninfected mice, sulindac significantly up-regulated
gastric mRNA levels of Ifn-c and Tnf-a (P < 0.05; Fig. 4). mRNA
levels of Ifn-c were down-regulated in mice that received sulindac
and antimicrobial therapy compared with uninfected mice that
received sulindac (P < 0.05); however, the gastric Ifn-c mRNA
levels in mice that received sulindac and antimicrobial therapy
were still higher than those in the untreated mice (P < 0.05).
H. pylori–uninfected mice that received combination therapy had
similar gastric Tnf-a expression compared with untreated mice or
mice that received sulindac. In contrast, Cox-1 and Cox-2

expression levels were not altered by sulindac or the combination
therapy. Expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines and Cox
enzymes were not changed in uninfected mice by YM022 or the
combination of YM022 and antimicrobial therapy. Additionally,
gastric Il-4 mRNA levels were not altered by sulindac or YM022,
alone or combined with antimicrobial therapy, respectively.
H. pylori infection up-regulated gastric mRNA levels of Ifn-c and
Tnf-a in male INS-GAS mice (P < 0.01; Fig. 5). H. pylori infection,
however, had no effect on mRNA levels of Cox-1, Cox-2, and Il-4 in
the stomach of mice. Compared with untreated H. pylori–infected
mice, infected mice that received sulindac had significantly higher
mRNA levels of Ifn-c, Tnf-a, Cox-1, Cox-2, and Il-4 (P < 0.05).
Infected mice that received sulindac and antimicrobial therapy had
reduced mRNA levels of Ifn-c and Tnf-a than those in untreated
infected INS-GAS mice (P < 0.05). H. pylori–infected mice that
received sulindac and antimicrobial therapy had higher Cox-1
mRNA levels (P < 0.001) and comparable Cox-2 and Il-4 mRNA
levels when compared with untreated infected mice. Compared
with infected mice that received sulindac, infected mice that
received sulindac and antimicrobial therapy had down-regulated
mRNA levels of Ifn-c, Tnf-a, Cox-2, and Il-4 (P < 0.01). YM022 did
not alter gastric mRNA levels of Ifn-c, Tnf-a, Cox-1, Cox-2, and Il-4 in
infected mice (Fig. 5). H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice that

received YM022 and antimicrobial therapy had comparable mRNA
levels of Cox-1, Cox-2, and Il-4 and significantly lower mRNA levels
of Ifn-c and Tnf-a when compared with untreated infected mice
and infected mice that received YM022 (P < 0.05).
Sulindac reduces gastric PGE2 levels in INS-GAS mice.
Among H. pylori–uninfected mice, sulindac reduced gastric PGE2
levels (1.09 F 0.27 ng/mg protein) compared with untreated mice
(3.03 F 0.59 ng/mg protein; P < 0.01; Fig. 4D). Mice that received
sulindac and antimicrobial therapy had lower gastric PGE2 levels
(1.62 F 0.34 ng/mg protein; P = 0.09) than untreated mice.
Compared with untreated mice, gastric PGE2 levels were slightly
higher in mice that received YM022 (4.33 F 0.71 ng/mg protein;
P = 0.17) or YM022 and antimicrobial therapy (5.51 F 0.64 ng/mg
protein; P < 0.05).
H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice had significantly higher gastric
PGE2 levels (9.73 F 0.81 ng/mg protein; P < 0.01) when compared
with uninfected mice. H. pylori–induced gastric PGE2 levels were
inhibited by sulindac (1.29 F 0.48 ng/mg protein; P < 0.01; Fig. 5D).
Infected mice receiving sulindac and antimicrobial therapy had
significantly lower gastric PGE2 levels (3.47 F 0.76 ng/mg protein;
P < 0.01) than untreated infected mice. YM022 alone reduced
gastric PGE2 levels (6.83 F 0.81 ng/mg protein; P < 0.05) in
H. pylori–infected mice. YM022 and antimicrobial therapy did

Sulindac and antimicrobial therapy decreased Th1associated, H. pylori–specific IgG2a antibody responses.
H. pylori infection significantly induced H. pylori–specific, Th1associated IgG2a responses in mice (P < 0.001; Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Sulindac treatment did not alter H. pylori–infected IgG2a
levels in H. pylori–infected mice (P = 0.09). Infected mice that
received sulindac and antimicrobials had H. pylori–specific IgG2a
levels comparable with untreated infected mice. Additionally,
H. pylori–specific IgG2a levels in infected mice that received the
sulindac and antimicrobial therapy were significantly lower than
those in infected mice that received sulindac (P < 0.05). In contrast,
YM022 alone or YM022 and antimicrobial therapy did not alter
H. pylori–specific IgG2a levels in infected mice. H. pylori infection
also induced H. pylori–specific, Th2-associated IgG1 responses
in mice (P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. S2B). Treatment modalities
in H. pylori–infected mice had no significant effect on H. pylori–
specific IgG1 levels compared with untreated infected mice.

regions of corpus mucosa in uninfected mice (Fig. 6B). In untreated
H. pylori–infected mice, proliferating cells in the corpus expanded
from the isthmus regions to hypertrophic foveolar regions, and the
Ki-67 LIs were higher than in uninfected mice (P < 0.01; Fig. 6A).
Among H. pylori–infected mice, proliferating cells were observed in
the hypertrophic foveolar regions of the corpus in those mice
receiving sulindac or YM022. The distribution of proliferative cells
was mainly in the isthmus region of the corpus mucosa in infected
mice receiving combination of sulindac or YM022 and H. pylori
eradication. Ki-67 LI positively correlated with severity of gastric
pathology and GIN; Ki-67 LI in H. pylori–infected mice receiving
sulindac or YM022 was similar to untreated H. pylori–infected
mice. Infected mice receiving the combination of sulindac or
YM022 and H. pylori antimicrobial eradication had a lower Ki-67 LI
compared with untreated H. pylori–infected mice and infected
mice that received sulindac or YM022 (P < 0.05, respectively).

Discussion
The role of Cox-2 in promoting cancer is mainly attributed to
PGE2 production and its ability to promote cell proliferation,

migration, and angiogenesis and inhibit apoptosis (37). NSAIDs
prevent some types of gastrointestinal cancer and other solid
tumors in humans (37). In epidemiologic studies, the use of NSAIDs
is generally associated with a lower risk gastric cancer. However, a
chemopreventive effect of NSAIDs on the development of gastric
cancer among H. pylori–infected individuals has not been
conclusively shown in human clinical trials (36, 38). In patients
that underwent H. pylori eradication therapy, chronic use of
celecoxib was associated with a higher regression rate of gastric
precancerous intestinal metaplasia (36). However, in patients that
had received H. pylori eradication therapy, treatment with another
selective Cox-2 inhibitor, rofecoxib, for 2 years did not reduce
intestinal metaplasia (38). Considering that cancer chemoprevention by NSAIDs is modulated by both Cox-dependent and Coxindependent pathways (39), NSAIDs may have variable efficacy in
their abilities to prevent gastric cancer.
Consistent with a role for Cox-2/PGE2 in carcinogenesis, doubletransgenic mice expressing Cox-2 and Pges-1 in the gastric mucosa
overproduce PGE2 and develop gastric hyperplasia, metaplasia, and
cancer in the glandular stomach (7). Because H. pylori infection
up-regulates Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production (5, 6), it is
reasonable to hypothesize that suppression of PGE2 should prevent
H. pylori–associated gastric carcinogenesis. However, H. pylori–
associated gastritis and Tnf-a expression are more severe in Cox1 / or Cox-2 / mice (40) and in H. pylori–infected mice

receiving NSAIDs (41). Furthermore, Cox-2 inhibition enhances Th1
immune responses against H. pylori (24, 25, 41). CD4+CD25+
regulatory T-cell function dampens H. pylori–associated gastritis in
C56BL/6 mice (30). PGE2 enhances the inhibitory function of
human regulatory T cells in vitro (42). Therefore, regulatory T-cell
function in the H. pylori–infected mice is likely to be compromised
by reduced PGE2 production in sulindac-treated animals. Suppressed regulatory T-cell function may have also contributed to
enhanced H. pylori–associated inflammation in infected mice
receiving sulindac alone, suggesting that PGE2 induced in response
to H. pylori infection plays a role in dampening gastric
inflammation and reducing inflammation-mediated gastric carcinogenesis (2). The benefit of PGE2 suppression by NSAIDs in
suppressing mediators of cancer progression, however, is not
significant to counteract the adverse effect of Cox-2 inhibition
associated with Th1-predominant inflammation caused by H. pylori
infection.
As described previously, H. pylori infection promoted gastric
carcinogenesis in INS-GAS male mice (8, 32). Although treatment
with sulindac suppressed H. pylori–induced gastric PGE2 levels,
sulindac alone did not prevent gastric cancer in chronically
infected INS-GAS mice. Moreover, sulindac exacerbated H. pylori–
induced gastritis and up-regulated expression of proinflammatory
cytokines. In contrast, a combination of sulindac and antimicrobial
therapy reduced gastric PGE2 levels and gastric inflammation and

resulted in significantly higher Ki-67 LI in mice (P < 0.01).
Sulindac or YM022 did not alter H. pylori –associated
increase of Ki-67 LI in INS-GAS mice. H. pylori–infected
mice receiving the combination of sulindac or YM022 and
H. pylori eradication had significantly lower Ki-67 LI
compared with untreated infected mice (both P < 0.05) or
infected mice that received sulindac or YM022 (P < 0.05,
respectively). Proliferating cells were positively stained for
Ki-67 (B ). In Helicobacter -uninfected INS-GAS mice,
proliferating cells were restricted to the isthmus regions.

H. pylori , Sulindac, and Cancer Prevention in Mice

prevented the development of H. pylori–associated gastric cancer.
These findings suggest that, in the presence of H. pylori infection,
selected NSAIDs enhance Th1-predominant proinflammatory
responses to H. pylori antigens (24) and may promote the
development of inflammation-mediated gastric cancer in a
susceptible host with chronic H. pylori infection (2). In previous
studies, suppression of PGE2 by Cox-2 inhibitors did not alter Th2associated Il-4 expression; instead, the treatment up-regulated
mRNA levels of Th1-associated Il-12 and Tnf-a in gastric tissue of
H. pylori–infected humans (24, 25). Sulindac treatment upregulated gastric Ifn-c and Tnf-a as well as Il-4 mRNA in
H. pylori–infected mice. Sulindac-mediated upregulation of Th1
proinflammatory cytokines positively correlated with the severity
of H. pylori–associated gastric lesions in infected mice. Sulindac
up-regulated gastric Ifn-c and Tnf-a mRNA levels in H. pylori–
uninfected INS-GAS mice, although gastric lesions and gastric
cancer risk were reduced. Sulindac also up-regulated Cox-1 and
Cox-2 mRNA levels in H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice despite that
it reduced gastric PGE2 levels as a result of its known Coxinhibitory effects (43). Sulindac is a prodrug that is converted to
sulfone and sulindac sulfide, and the sulfide form has been shown
to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g and
induce Cox-2 expression (44). The significance of up-regulated
mRNA expression of Cox-1 and Cox-2 in H. pylori–infected mice
that received sulindac is not clear and needs further study. The
combination of sulindac and H. pylori eradication reduced the
H. pylori–specific IgG2a titers, which were not significantly altered
by sulindac treatment.
Sulindac prevented gastrin-driven carcinogenesis in H. pylori–
uninfected male mice despite upregulation of proinflammatory
cytokines. Moreover, the combination of sulindac and antimicrobial therapy was more effective in preventing gastric lesions,
reducing cell proliferation in gastric mucosa and incidence of
gastric cancer in H. pylori–uninfected mice whose stomachs are
known to be colonized with enteric flora (32). Normal microbiota
colonize all regions of the bowel, including the upper gastrointestinal tract of mice (45). Antimicrobial therapy with omeprazole,
metronidazole, and clarithromycin resulted in dynamic changes of
the gastric microbiota in humans (46). These findings in humans
and mice suggest that gastric flora other than H. pylori contribute
to gastric inflammation and cancer (2).
Chemoprevention of Helicobacter-associated gastric cancer in
INS-GAS mice was observed previously in long-term (6 months)
suppression of CCK2/gastrin signaling by treatment with YF476,
which was initiated during the acute stage of Helicobacter infection
(27). We observed that the CCK2/gastrin receptor antagonist,
YM022, alone or in combination with antimicrobial therapy
reduced gastric cancer risk in H. pylori–uninfected INS-GAS mice.
However, the chemopreventive effect of YM022 alone or in
combination with antimicrobial therapy was not observed in
H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice when the 6-week treatment was

initiated during the chronic stage of H. pylori infection. YM022
blockade of gastrin signaling (27) was not sufficient to counteract
YM022-associated gastric pH elevation, which may facilitate
overgrowth of certain gastric flora following H. pylori eradication
therapy (32). These differing results in our current study and the
previous report using YF476 might reflect intrinsic differences in
the two antagonists but were more likely due to the different
treatment schedules in these two studies. The data, however, are
consistent with gastrin playing an important role early, but not
later, in the multistep progression to gastric cancer (11).
Gastric proinflammatory cytokines and cell proliferation
markers were down-regulated using the combination of YM022
and H. pylori eradication in H. pylori–infected INS-GAS mice,
suggesting that this regimen has chemopreventive potential for
gastric cancer. Regression of preneoplastic gastric intestinal
metaplasia following H. pylori eradication is positively correlated
with the interval that patients have been free of H. pylori infection
(47). This suggests that regression of H. pylori–associated gastric
lesions and gastric cancer risk may not be observed during the first
few years after treatment (48). A longer period of follow-up may be
necessary to examine the chemopreventive effect of Helicobacterassociated gastric cancer in INS-GAS mice using a combination of
YM022 and H. pylori eradication.
Our data show that NSAIDs are an effective treatment modality
in preventing of H. pylori–associated gastric cancer provided that
H. pylori is eradicated before NSAIDs treatment is initiated. This
study highlights the possible adverse effect of selected NSAIDs in
promoting H. pylori–associated gastritis and cancer progression in
susceptible hosts despite that PGE2 suppression by NSAIDs has
chemopreventive properties in treatment of colon cancer and other
solid tumors (19, 20, 37). A probable mechanism by which NSAIDs
exacerbates H. pylori–associated gastritis and gastric cancer is via
an enhanced proinflammatory Th1 immune response. Our study is
consistent with the Maastricht III Consensus Report, which
recommends H. pylori eradication for the prevention of peptic
ulcer and gastric cancer, especially in patients with long-term
NSAID usage (49).
