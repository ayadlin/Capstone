Abstract
B-Raf is the most mutated gene in melanoma; however, the
mechanism through which it promotes early melanomas
remains uncertain. Most nevi contain activated V600EB-Raf
but few develop into melanoma, and expression in melanocytes is inhibitory with low protein levels present in surviving cells, suggesting unknown cooperative oncogenic events
are necessary for melanoma development. Because many
melanomas have V600EB-Raf and active Akt3, it is possible that
these proteins cooperatively facilitate melanocyte transformation. In this study, Akt3 is shown to phosphorylate V600EBRaf to lower its activity as well as that of the downstream
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway to levels
promoting early melanoma development. Expression of active
Akt3 in early melanoma cells containing V600EB-Raf reduced
MAPK signaling and promoted anchorage-independent
growth. Furthermore, expression of both V600EB-Raf and active
Akt3 in melanocytes promoted a transformed phenotype.
Mechanistically, aberrant Akt3 activity in early melanomas
serves to phosphorylate Ser364 and Ser428 on V600EB-Raf to
reduce activity of V600EB-Raf to levels that promote rather
than inhibit proliferation, which aids melanocytic transformation. Inhibition of V600EB-Raf or Akt3 in advanced melanoma cells in which both pathways were active reduced
anchorage-independent growth and tumor development in a
cooperatively acting manner. Inhibition of Akt3 alone in these
cells led to increased MAPK signaling. In summary, these
results suggest that activating B-Raf mutations initially
promote nevi development, but the resulting high, intense
activation of the MAPK pathway inhibits further tumor
progression requiring Akt3 activation to bypass this barrier
and aid melanoma development. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3429–39]

Introduction
Despite being the least prevalent type of skin cancer, malignant
melanoma is by far the deadliest due to its highly metastatic nature
(1). Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH (PI3) and mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathways play prominent roles in melanoma
development by regulating diverse cellular processes including
cellular proliferation, survival, invasion, and angiogenesis (2–4).
The mechanism through which these pathways interact or
cooperate to promote melanoma development remains to be fully
elucidated (2).

Increased activity of the PI3K pathway occurs in f70% of sporadic melanomas due to loss of PTEN and/or increased expression
of Akt3 resulting from elevated gene copy number (5). Highest level
of Akt3 activity occur in metastatic melanomas, deregulating
apoptotic signaling and promoting chemoresistance, making it an
attractive therapeutic target for metastatic disease (6–8). Targeting
Akt3 decreases tumorigenesis by increasing cellular apoptosis in
advanced stage melanomas, but it is not known whether it plays a
second independent role in early melanoma development (7, 9).
The MAPK pathway is activated through Ras mutations in 10%
to 15% and B-Raf mutations in f60% of melanomas (10–16). A
single-base mutation converting T to A at nucleotide 1,799 of B-Raf,
substituting a valine for a glutamic acid at codon 600 (V600E) in
exon 15, is the most prominent mutation (12) and is acquired but
not inherited during development of sporadic melanomas (17–19).
Because B-Raf is the most mutated gene in melanomas, it is an
attractive therapeutic target for melanoma patients (20).
Although V600EB-Raf regulates melanoma cellular proliferation
(21–23), angiogenesis (21), survival (22, 23), invasion, and metastasis (24, 25), it alone is not sufficient for melanoma development.
Ectopic expression of Ras or Raf in primary or cancer cell lines
causes cell cycle arrest or senescence (26), likely due to duration or
level of MAPK pathway activation (27), which induces cyclindependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors (28, 29). Thus, other factors are
necessary to facilitate melanoma tumor progression, likely involving loss of tumor suppressor genes or acquisition of cooperating
oncogene activation (30–33). Possibly, deregulation of p53 (31, 33)
and/or Rb pathway through p16INK4A loss (30, 31) might be
necessary. Another unexplored possibility might involve cooperation between V600EB-Raf and Akt3 signaling cascades, which are
frequently activated in the same cells (3, 4). In support of this
possibility, Akt has been shown to phosphorylate B-Raf to decrease
its activity in normal cells; however, it is unknown whether this
process could play any role in melanoma development (34–36).
In this study, V600EB-Raf and Akt3 are shown to cooperatively
promote melanoma development. Akt3 is shown to phosphorylate
mutant V600EB-Raf to reduce its and MAPK pathway activity to
levels promoting rather than retarding melanocytic cell growth and
transformation. Thus, these results suggest that activating V600EBRaf mutation initially promotes nevi development, but the resulting
high, intense activation of the MAPK pathway inhibits further tumor
progression requiring Akt3 activation to phosphorylate V600EB-Raf
to bypass this barrier and promote melanoma development.

In vitro Pharmacologic Agent Studies
The PI3K inhibitor LY-294002 (Qbiogene) was used to pharmacologically
inhibit Akt activity. Briefly, 1  106 NHEM, WM35, SK-MEL-24, or 1.5  105
UACC 903 cells were grown in complete medium supplemented with FBS or
growth factors. Two days later, cells were fed with serum/growth factor–free
medium. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with 50 mmol/L
LY-294002 or DMSO for 20 min followed by stimulation using serum or
growth factors up to 180 min. At each time point, protein lysates were
collected for Western blot analysis.

Western Blot Analysis
Protein lysates were collected, quantitated, and analyzed by Western
blotting as detailed previously (21). Antibodies to pErk and pAkt Ser473 and
caspase-3 from Cell Signaling Technologies; cyclin D1, p27 Kip1, a-enolase,
anti-Hemagglutinin, and B-Raf from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and Akt3
from Upstate Biotechnology were used.

Plasmid Constructs
Hemagglutinin-tagged wild-type and kinase-dead Akt3 (40) were
subcloned (Eco RI and Xba I) into pcDNA3.1puro. A myristoylation tag
was added by PCR to the NH2 terminal of Akt3 and subcloned into the Eco
RI and Xba I. Site-directed mutagenesis (Quick Change) was used to create
E40K Akt3 mutant with primers TGGCTCATTCATAGGATATAAAAAGAAACCTCAAGATGTGGATTT and AAATCCACATCTTGAGGTTTCTTTTTATATCCTATGAATGAGCCA. For B-Raf constructs, Hemagglutinin-tagged
wild-type B-Raf (provided by Dr. Ann Vojtek, University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, MI) was excised (Hind III/Eco RV) and subcloned into pcDNA6/V5HisA (Invitrogen; ref. 41). Site-directed mutagenesis with primers
GATTTTGGTCTAGCTACAGAGAAATCTCGATGGAGTGGG and CCCACTCCATCGAGATTTCTCTGTAGCTAGACCAAAATC generated V600EB-Raf.
Similarly, primers CGAGACCGATCCTCAGCAGCTCCCAATGTGCAT and
ATGCACATTGGGAGCTGCTGAGGATCGGTCTCG generated S364A
V600E
B-Raf, and primers GCGAGAAAGGAAGTCAGCTTCATCCTCAGAAGAC and GTCTTCTGAGGATGAAGCTGACTTCCTTTCTCGC generated
S428A V600EB-Raf. Construct inserts were sequence verified. Plasmids were
introduced into cell lines with the Amaxa Nucleofector. Reagent R, K17
program was used for UACC 903 cells, whereas NHEM reagent, U20
program was used for human melanocytes, WM35, and melan-a cells.
Transfection efficiencies were determined to be f60% using pMaxGFP as a
green fluorescent protein expression plasmid control.

Anchorage-Independent Growth Studies
Plates were coated with PolyHEMA (12.0 mg/mL; Sigma) in 95% ethanol
to assess anchorage-independent growth.
siRNA-mediated inhibition. Duplexed ‘‘Stealth’’ siRNA from Invitrogen
was used for inhibiting protein expression as described previously (7, 9,
25, 39). siRNA (100 or 200 pmol) was nucleofected into 2  106 human
melanocytes, UACC 903, or WM35 cells allowed to recover for 1.5 to 2 d.
Cells were then trypsinized, and 2  104 cells were seeded into PolyHEMAcoated 96-well plates. Protein lysates for Western blot analysis was
harvested. For UACC 903, 1  104 cells per well were seeded into DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS or 2  104 cells per well in serum-free
conditions. Cell proliferation was quantified 3 d later by MTS assay
(Promega).
Ectopic plasmid expression studies. Hemagglutinin-tagged Akt3
constructs (1.45 pmol pcDNA3.1puro Hemagglutinin wt-Akt3, E40K-Akt3,
myr-Akt3, and dead-Akt3) were nucleofected alone or in combination
with siRNA to PRAS40 (100 pmol) or a scrambled siRNA into 2  106 cells,
5  104 cells/50 AL plated into 96-well PolyHEMA-coated plates. Twentyfour hours later, cells were selected using 1.6 Ag/mL puromycin-containing
medium. After 7 d of selection, anchorage-independent growth was
assessed by MTS assay.

Melan-A Transformation Assays

Cells (2  106) were nucleofected with 1.45 pmol of pcDNA6 V600EB-Raf,
pcDNA6 AA-V600EB-Raf alone, or in combination with pcDNA3.1puro myrAkt3 or E40K-Akt3. Cells (4  104) per 50 AL were added to 96-well PolyHEMA-coated plates. After overnight recovery, 50 AL DMEM-supplemented

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

with 10% FBS, 6 Ag/mL puromycin, and/or 6 Ag/mL blasticidin were added
to give a final concentration of 3 Ag/mL. After 3 d of selection, cell viability
was quantified by MTS assay.
V600E

B-Raf Kinase Assay

Hemagglutinin-tagged pcDNA6 V600EB-Raf, S364A V600EB-Raf, S428A
V600E
B-Raf, AA-V600EB-Raf (S364A and S428A), or Dead B-Raf (1.45 pmol)
were nucleofected together with 1.45 pmol pcDNA 3.1myc-His myr-Akt3
into melan-a cells to phosphorylate ectopically expressed B-Raf at serine
residues 364 and 428. Cell lysates were harvested 3 d later using lysis
buffer containing 20 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0), 2 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L
h-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L activated sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton
X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma). Various Hemagglutinin-tagged B-Raf proteins
were immunoprecipitated from 150 Ag of total lysates using 0.2 Ag of
antibody against Hemagglutinin, which was precoupled to Gamma Bind G
sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Activity of immunoprecipitated
B-Raf was measured as previously reported (42) using full-length Mek
protein substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Samples were separated on
duplicate NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen), with protein on one gel transferred
onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Western blot analysis) and other
gel fixed in 10% acetic acid/50% methanol, dried, and then exposed to
HyBlot CL autoradiography film (Denville) for 32P Mek detection.

Phosphorylated B-Raf Analysis
Hemagglutinin-tagged B-Raf expressing plasmids [pcDNA6 wild-type
B-Raf, V600EB-Raf, S364A V600EB-Raf, and AA-V600EB-Raf (S364A, S428A)] were
nucleofected separately or in combination with pcDNA 3.1myc-His myrAkt3 into melan-a cells, seeded into PolyHEMA-coated plates and cell
lysates harvested 3 d later. Various Hemagglutinin-tagged B-Raf proteins
were immunoprecipitated from 20 to 40 Ag of total lysates using 0.1 Ag of
antibody against Hemagglutinin using Gamma Bind G sepharose. Samples
were separated on NuPAGE gels for Western blot analysis and probed with
anti-Hemagglutinin and antiphosphorylated-Akt substrate monoclonal
antibody (Cell Signaling). Western blot images were scanned and quantified
using the Image Gauge 4.0 software (Fuji Photo Film Co.).

Animal Studies
siRNA (112.5 pmol for Akt3, C-Raf, and scrambled; 12.5 pmol for V600EBRaf together with 100 pmol of scrambled siRNA; or 12.5 pmol for V600EB-Raf
together with 100 pmol of Akt3 siRNA) was nucleofected into 1  106 UACC
903 cells. Thirty-six hours later, 1  106 UACC 903 cells in 0.2 mL of DMEM
solution were injected s.c. into the left and right flanks of 4- to 6-wk-old
nude mice. Dimensions of developing tumors were measured on alternate
days up to day 17.5.

Statistical Analysis
One-way or Two-way ANOVA was used for groupwise comparisons,
followed by the Tukey’s or Bonferroni post hoc test. Results were considered
significant at a P value of <0.05. Chou-Talalay method (Calcusyn software)
was used for determining the combination Index (Biosoft; ref. 43).

Results
PI3k pathway inhibition increases MAPK activity in melanomas but not normal melanocytes. In melanomas, the PI3k
pathway is activated through increased Akt3 expression and/or
PTEN loss (7, 39). The MAPK pathway is primarily activated
through mutation of B-Raf to a constitutively active V600E form
(7, 21, 22, 24, 39, 44). Whether these pathways cooperate in early
melanoma development remains an unanswered question. To
investigate this possibility, activation of each pathway in melanocytes, having normal levels of Akt3 activity and wild-type B-Raf,
was compared with UACC 903 melanoma cells having increased
Akt3 activity as well as constitutively active V600EB-Raf, after growth
factor starvation and stimulation. Densitometric analysis of Western blots quantified pErk and pAkt levels, which estimates MAP

Akt3 and

and PI3K pathway activity, respectively, and were plotted as a continuum from 0 to 180 min after serum stimulation (Fig. 1A and B).
Note, profiles represent best-fit lines showing minor perturbations
due to graphical software. In starved melanocytes, activity levels of
both pathways were initially low (Fig. 1A); however, upon growth
factor stimulation, activity of both pathways increases transiently
and declined over time to basal levels due to receptor desensitization, as reported for other model systems (34). In contrast, UACC
903 cells, which had significantly higher basal activity than melanocytes, showed an increase in pAkt accompanied by a corresponding decrease in MAPK pathway activity determined by
measuring pErk (Fig. 1B; refs. 7, 14, 21). After serum stimulation,
activity of both pathways in UACC 903 cells increased; however, as
observed with other cell systems, growth factor stimulation led to
transient increases in activity of both pathways that declined over
time (34). This decrease was not observed after Akt inhibition using
LY-294002; rather, pErk plateaued at high levels. Representative
Western blots showing pErk and pAkt levels 30 and 60 min after
growth factor or serum stimulation are shown in Fig. 1C. Although
melanocytes showed no increase in pErk levels after inhibition of
Akt using LY-294002, inhibition increased pErk levels for both
UACC 903 and SK-MEL-24 cell lines (Fig. 1C). Different serum
stimulation times that corresponded to the peak pAkt/Erk levels
for each cell line were selected to easily observe changes in phosphorylation after agent manipulation (34). Thus, inhibition of PI3K
pathway increased MAPK activity, suggesting inhibitory crossregulation between these pathways in melanoma cells but not
melanocytes.
Akt3 kinase regulates MAPK pathway activity. To establish
whether Akt3 in the PI3K signaling cascade down-regulated MAPK
pathway activity, siRNA targeting Akt3 was introduced into UACC
903 cells to inhibit protein expression, and cells were starved, then
stimulated with serum followed by measurement of pAkt/Erk
levels. Reducing Akt3 protein expression (activity) in UACC 903
cells caused a corresponding decrease in pAkt levels (Fig. 1D).
In contrast, no change was observed in levels of pErk in melanocytes after siRNA-mediated knockdown of Akt3, similar to
results observed after pharmacologic inhibition of Akt signaling in
melanocytes (Fig. 1C). Significantly, decreased Akt3 activity caused
a corresponding increase in MAPK activity observed by measuring
pErk1/2 levels. Thus, Akt3 regulated the activity of the MAPK
pathway.
Presence of V600EB-Raf and absence of constitutively
activated Akt3 increased MAPK activity. The interactive roles
of Akt3 and mutant V600EB-Raf in melanoma development were
evaluated by measuring in vitro anchorage-independent growth of
WM35 cells. Cells were derived from an early stage melanocytic
lesion in the radial growth phase containing the (T1799A) B-Raf
mutation (19). However, unlike UACC 903 cells, WM35 cells have
low endogenous Akt3 activity due to presence of functional PTEN
(7). Thus, WM35 cells are similar to f90% of human nevi
containing V600EB-Raf and having low Akt3 activity (6, 7, 14, 15, 44),
making it a suitable model for evaluating the role played by Akt3 in
melanocytic tumor progression. Densitometric analysis of Western
blots showed pErk/Akt levels in WM35 cells after stimulation with
growth factors after 24 h starvation (Fig. 2A). Upon growth factor
stimulation, activity of both pathways increased transiently in
WM35 cells and, over time, pAkt declined to basal levels due to
receptor desensitization similar to that observed for melanocytes
because both cell types contain PTEN (19, 34). In contrast, levels of
pErk did not decline to near baseline levels; rather, pErk levels

remained at near maximal amounts for duration of the experiment
due to V600EB-Raf constitutively activating the downstream MAPK
pathway (Figs. 1A and 2A). Thus, presence of V600EB-Raf and
absence of constitutively activated Akt3 led to high MAPK activity,
with potential to retard tumor progression.
Regulating MAPK pathway activity by targeting Akt3.
Regulation of V600EB-Raf activity by Akt3 was examined using
pharmacologic inhibition of Akt or expression of active myristoylated Akt3 in WM35 cells to examine effect on pErk/Akt levels.
Although WM35 cells have low levels of pAkt compared with UACC
903 cells, inhibition of Akt using LY-294002 decreased levels of
pAkt, causing a corresponding increase in pErk (Fig. 2B) similar to
that observed for advanced melanoma cell lines (Fig. 1C). Because
WM35 cells had levels of pAkt similar to those observed in normal
melanocytes, constructs ectopically expressing constitutively active
Akt3 were used to produce pAkt levels similar to those observed in
more aggressive melanomas to confirm Akt3-mediated regulation
of MAPK pathway activity. Western blot analysis showed increased
pAkt accompanied by a corresponding decrease in pErk after
ectopic expression of active myristoylated Akt3 but not dead
Akt3 (control-producing inert protein; Fig. 2B). Thus, cross
regulation between Akt3 and MAPK pathway activity occur with
active Akt3.
V600E
B-Raf and Akt3 promote anchorage-independent
growth. Effect of V600EB-Raf and Akt3 expression on melanocytic
transformation was measured by regulating expression of each
protein and quantifying anchorage-independent growth (a phenotypic measurement of cell transformation). WM35 cells were
nucleofected with siRNA against B-Raf and seeded onto PolyHEMA-coated 96-well plates. A significant decrease of viable WM35
cells was observed after nucleofection with B-Raf siRNA compared
with a scrambled control (P < 0.05; One-way ANOVA; Fig. 2C).
Western blot analysis confirmed B-Raf protein knockdown and
corresponding decrease in downstream pErk (Fig. 2C). Next,
myristoylated Akt3 having high activity or the E40K-Akt3 mutant
having activity in the normal physiologic range was expressed in
WM35 cells containing endogenous V600EB-Raf to determine
whether it could enhance anchorage-independent growth (45).
Akt3 expression significantly enhanced anchorage-independent
growth compared with vector controls, which was directly proportional to level of pAkt (P < 0.001; One-way ANOVA; Fig. 2D).
Expression of wild-type protein had lowest pAkt and least effect on
anchorage-independent growth. To show that Akt3-mediated
anchorage-independent growth of WM35 cells was not due to
decreased apoptosis reported in advanced melanoma (7, 9), the
downstream target of Akt3 regulating apoptosis, called PRAS40,
was knocked down using siRNA while active Akt3 was expressed
(9). Similar anchorage-independent growth was observed irrespective of levels of PRAS40 expression (Fig. 2D). Thus, deregulated
apoptosis mediated by active Akt3 was not leading to enhanced
anchorage-independent growth. This raised the possibility that
Akt3 could be interacting with V600EB-Raf to regulate anchorageindependent growth because Akt has been reported to downregulate B-Raf activity through direct phosphorylation (34–36).
Thus, V600EB-Raf and Akt3 mediate anchorage-independent growth
in the WM35 cell model and potentially cooperate in melanocyte
transformation.
Akt3 cooperates with V600EB-Raf to transform melanocytes.
Because Akt3 and V600EB-Raf independently regulated anchorageindependent growth of WM35 cells, effect of ectopic coexpression
on melanocyte transformation was examined using melan-a mouse

starved 24 h, treated with or without
LY-294002 for 20 min, then serum

different time points for Western blot
analysis. Analysis shows LY-294002
abrogates activation of Akt (pAkt) and
consequently increases Erk activation
(phosphorylation) in melanoma cells but
not in human melanocytes. C, inhibition
of Akt activation results in higher pErk
levels in melanoma cell lines but not in
melanocytes. Western blots are shown for
pAkt and pErk levels in normal human
melanocytes and two human metastatic
melanoma cell lines, UACC 903 and

then untreated or treated with DMSO or

stimulated with growth factors or serum
in medium and protein lysates harvested
for Western blot analysis. The two
metastatic melanoma cell lines showed
evidence that LY-294002 treatment
increased pErk levels, which did not
occur in normal human melanocytes.
D, inhibition of Akt3 increased pErk levels
in melanoma cells. Normal melanocytes
were transfected with scrambled siRNA
(siScrambled ), or siRNA targeting PTEN
(siPTEN ), or Akt3 (siAkt3) alone or in
combination. After 48 h, cell lysates were
analyzed for PTEN, Akt3, pAkt, and pErk
levels. Inhibiting Akt3 protein expression
had no effect on pErk levels. UACC 903
cells were transfected with buffer,
scrambled siRNA, or Akt3-targeting siRNA,
starved 24 h, then stimulated with
medium-containing serum for 30 or
60 min, and protein lysates harvested
for Western blot analysis. siRNA-mediated
inhibition of Akt3 increased pErk levels
compared with buffer or scrambled siRNA
controls. a-enolase served as a control
for protein loading.

B-Raf Cooperate in Melanoma Development

Figure 2. V600EB-Raf and Akt3 regulate anchorage-independent growth of early melanoma cells. A, WM35 cells have constitutive activation of MAPK pathway signaling
due to presence of V600EB-Raf but normal Akt activity. Densitometric quantitation of pAkt and pErk levels from Western blots of the WM35 cell line after 24 h of serum
starvation followed by stimulation shows constitutively high levels of pErk despite serum starvation, which is caused by V600EB-Raf activating the MAPK signaling
cascade. In contrast, the Akt activation profile is similar to that observed for melanocytes. B, inhibition of pAkt in WM35 cells using LY-294002 resulted in higher
pErk, whereas expression of active Akt3 decreased pErk levels. Treatment with LY-294002 led to a reduction in pAkt and a corresponding increase in pErk levels.
Ectopic expression of active Akt3 decreased pErk levels. WM35 cells were nucleofected with Akt3 expressing constructs, and after 2 d of recovery, cells were starved
for 24 h, and then stimulated with serum-containing medium and protein lysates collected for Western blot analysis. Ectopic myristoylated-Akt3 expression led to
decreased pErk levels. C, inhibition of B-Raf decreases anchorage-independent growth of early melanoma cells. WM35 cells were nucleofected with siRNA
targeting V600EB-Raf (100 and 200 pmol), scrambled siRNA, or a water control. Cells were then plated onto PolyHEMA-coated 96-well plates to measure the
effect on anchorage-independent growth. MTS assay, 3 d later, was used to quantify viable cell number. Western blot showed efficient knockdown of B-Raf protein
expression and decreased pErk levels. D, ectopic expression of active Akt3 enhanced anchorage-independent growth. Viability of WM35 cells nucleofected with Akt3 is
shown along with Western blot analysis of cell lysates. WM35 cells were nucleofected with various Akt3 expressing constructs: empty vector, wt-Akt3, Dead-Akt3,
and active Akt3; myristoylated-Akt3 (myr-Akt3 ) or E40K-Akt3 alone or in combination with a siRNA targeting PRAS40 protein. After nucleofection, cells were plated
directly onto PolyHEMA-coated 96-well plates, and after 3 d of growth in selection medium, an MTS assay was used to quantify cell viability. Myr-Akt3 significantly
increased cell growth compared with less active E40K-Akt3 that had a more modest effect. Changes in cell growth corresponded directly to pAkt level, which is shown
by Western blot analysis and quantified by densitometry. Knocking down PRAS40 had no significant effect on cell viability indicating that deregulated apoptosis
mediated by active Akt3 was not leading to enhanced anchorage independent growth. Hemagglutinin-probed Western blot shows equal ectopic expression of the
different Akt3 proteins. a-enolase served as a control for protein loading.

melanocytes to assess transformation by anchorage-independent
growth. This model was chosen because melan-a cells undergo
transformation after low level V600EB-Raf expression (46, 47).
Ectopically expressed V600EB-Raf or active-Akt3 alone, promoted
anchorage-independent growth compared with empty vector
(P < 0.001; Fig. 3A). Numerous groups have reported the oncogenic
properties of myr-Akt3 (48). However, a limitation is that the
activity resulting from myr-Akt3 is very high, which could be an
explanation for cell transformation. Therefore, we incorporated the
E40K Akt3 mutant that leads to more moderate physiologic pAkt
levels similar to those present in more aggressive melanoma cells.
Coexpression of V600EB-Raf with active E40K- or myr-Akt3 led to
statistically significant enhanced anchorage-independent growth
compared with single genes (lanes 5 versus 2 or 3, P < 0.05; lanes 6
versus 2 or 4, P < 0.001; Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis of cell lysates
showed that active myr-Akt3 reduced levels of pErk accompanying
V600E
B-Raf expression (Fig. 3A). A similar but less significant effect
was seen after E40K Akt3 coexpression with V600EB-Raf (Fig. 3A).
These results suggest that active Akt3 and V600EB-Raf cooperate in
melanocyte transformation, promoting anchorage-independent
growth.
Akt3 kinase phosphorylates V600EB-Raf to lower in vitro
activity. To determine whether phosphorylation mediated by Akt3regulated V600EB-Raf activity, serine residues 364 and/or 428 in
V600E
B-Raf were converted to alanine. Plasmids expressing these
B-Raf constructs were conucleofected with myr-Akt3 into melan-a
cells to promote phosphorylation of ectopically expressed B-Raf
proteins on Ser364 and Ser428. V600EB-Raf constructs containing
alanine at residues 364 and/or 428 could not be phosphorylated by
Akt3. Various Hemagglutinin-tagged B-Raf proteins were then
immunoprecipitated, and activity was measured using an in vitro
kinase assay with Mek as the substrate (Fig. 3B). AA-V600EB-Raf
(S364A and S428A) exhibited highest level of activity compared
with V600EB-Raf, V600EB-Raf (S364A), or V600EB-Raf (S428A; P < 0.05;
Fig. 3B), demonstrating that direct phosphorylation of V600EB-Raf
protein by Akt3 decreased its activity. Thus, phosphorylation of
V600E
B-Raf has significant potential to decrease activity of the
mutant protein.
Active Akt3 phosphorylates V600EB-Raf in melanocytic cells.
To show that Akt3 phosphorylates mutant V600EB-Raf in melanocytic cells, melan-a melanocytes were transfected with Hemagglutinin-tagged V600EB-Raf, V600EB-Raf (S364A), or AA-V600EB-Raf
(S364A and S428A) alone or with myr-Akt3. Western blot analysis
using an antibody recognizing consensus sequences typically
phosphorylated by Akt was used to quantify levels of phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated Hemagglutinin-tagged B-Raf from
cells (Fig. 3C). V600EB-Raf (S428A) was not used because the
antibody does not recognize this site. Increased phosphorylation of
V600E
B-Raf occurred when coexpressed with active Akt3 (P < 0.01;
Fig. 3C). Mutation of Ser364 to alanine [V600EB-Raf (S364A)]
decreased pB-Raf levels (P < 0.01; Fig. 3C). Furthermore, mutation
of both Ser364 and Ser428 to alanines [AA-V600EB-Raf (S364A and
S428A)] completely blocked phosphorylation by Akt3 (P < 0.01;
Fig. 3C). Thus, active Akt3 is capable of phosphorylating V600EB-Raf
in melanocytic cells.
Phosphorylation of V600EB-Raf decreases MAPK pathway
signaling, overcoming inhibitory growth effects associated
with high activity. Effect of phosphorylated versus unphosphorylated V600EB-Raf on melanocytic transformation was examined by
expressing V600EB-Raf or AA-V600EB-Raf (S364A and S428A) alone or
with active Akt3 in melan-a cells and measuring anchorage-

independent growth. Compared with V600EB-Raf expression alone,
AA-V600EB-Raf (S364A and S428A) protein significantly decreased
cell proliferation (P < 0.001; Fig. 4A). Similarly, coexpression of
AA-V600EB-Raf (S364A and S428A) with myristoylated or E40K Akt3
also significantly reduced proliferation when compared with cells
expressing V600EB-Raf or Akt3 (Fig. 4A; P < 0.001). Western blot
analysis of cell lysates showed AA-V600EB-Raf (S364A and S428A)
expression accompanied by higher MAPK pathway activity than
what occurred with V600EB-Raf (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, coexpression
of AA-V600EB-Raf (S364A and S428A) with myristoylated-Akt3 did
not lower pErk levels as observed when V600EB-Raf and myristoylated Akt3 were coexpressed (Fig. 4B). Induction of cyclin D1 was
also impaired after AA-V600EB-Raf (S364A and S428A) expression
(Fig. 4B). Thus, phosphorylation of V600EB-Raf by Akt3 decreased
MAPK signaling, overcoming growth inhibitory effects associated
with high pathway activity.
Targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 in melanomas cooperatively
inhibits tumorigenesis. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of
simultaneously inhibiting Akt3 and mutant V600EB-Raf in melanoma tumorigenesis, a siRNA was used to inhibit protein expression.
Effects on tumor development was studied by nucleofecting siRNA
against each target into UACC 903 cells, allowing 1.5 days of
recovery in culture followed by s.c. injection of 1 million cells into
nude mice. Reduced expression of each protein was observed for
as long as 9.5 days after nucleofection in cultured cells and in
tumors of nude mice (data not shown; ref. 25). Size of developing
tumors was measured using calipers every other day until day 17.
Initially, siRNA against Akt3 and B-Raf was titered to establish
optimal concentration inhibiting tumorigenesis to a similar extent.
One hundred pmol of Akt3 siRNA was found to inhibit tumorigenesis similar to that occurring with 12.5 pmol of siRNA against
B-Raf (Fig. 5A). In comparison to controls (buffer, scrambled
siRNA, and C-Raf siRNA), siRNA against Akt3 or V600EB-Raf significantly decreased the tumorigenic potential of the UACC 903
cells (Fig. 5A). An even more dramatic reduction in tumorigenesis
was observed after simultaneous inhibition of both Akt3 and
B-Raf. Under these conditions, cooperatively acting tumor inhibition was observed (P < 0.001; Two-way ANOVA; Fig. 5A). Tumors
removed from mice 9.5 days after siRNA nucleofection were found
to have reduced Akt3 (Fig. 5B) or V600EB-Raf (Fig. 5C) protein
expression, demonstrating effective knockdown of these proteins.
Thus, targeting both Akt3 and B-Raf led to cooperatively acting
tumor inhibition.
Simultaneously targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 inhibits
anchorage-independent growth. Because targeting Akt3 and
V600E
B-Raf led to cooperative tumor inhibition, mechanistic basis
for inhibition was examined next. siRNA targeting Akt3 and/or
V600E
B-Raf was nucleofected into UACC 903 cells, and its effect on
in vitro anchorage-independent growth was examined. Simultaneous siRNA-mediated inhibition of Akt3 and B-Raf dramatically
inhibited growth of cells compared with either Akt3 or B-Raf
(Fig. 6A, lanes 2, 4, and 7 and lanes 2, 5, and 8; ANOVA, P < 0.001;
ref. 49). To determine whether inhibition of anchorage-independent
growth was additive or synergistic after siRNA-mediated inhibition
of Akt3 and V600EB-Raf, the Chou-Talalay method for determining
the combination index using Calcusyn software was undertaken
(43). Using this approach, combination index values of <0.9 are
synergistic, of >1.1 are antagonistic, and values of 0.9 to 1.1 are
nearly additive. Experimentally, Akt3 siRNA was kept at a constant
dose of 200 pmol, whereas the concentration of B-Raf siRNA was
titrated at doses of 3, 6, and 12 pmol. The resulting combination

B-Raf Cooperate in Melanoma Development

Figure 3. V600EB-Raf and Akt3 cooperate in melanocyte transformation. A, Melan-a transformation, after ectopic V600EB-Raf and Akt3 expression, was quantified
by measuring effect on anchorage-independent growth. Melan-a cells were nucleofected with various combinations of V600EB-Raf and Akt3 expression plasmids
(resistant to blasticidin and puromycin, respectively) and then directly plated onto PolyHEMA-coated 96-well plates. Transfected cells were selected for blasticidin and
puromycin resistance for 3 d followed by MTS assay to quantify cell viability. Results of a representative MTS assay are shown indicating effects of V600EB-Raf and Akt3
expression on anchorage-independent growth. Nucleofections of either V600EB-Raf or myr-Akt3 led to increased cell viability; however, coexpression of both genes
resulted in a more statistically significant effect. Western blots indicate changes in signaling pathways after ectopic expression of B-Raf and Akt3. Columns, mean; bars,

index for each combination was calculated to be 0.909, 1.023, and
1.107, for 3, 6, and 12 pmol of B-Raf siRNA, respectively combined
with 200 pmol of Akt3 siRNA, which suggest nearly additive
cooperation. Thus, simultaneously targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3
inhibits anchorage-independent growth in a cooperatively additive
manner.
Simultaneously targeting both Akt3 and V600EB-Raf enhances growth inhibition and apoptotic effects on signaling cascades. Mechanistic basis for inhibition of anchorage-independent
growth after V600EB-Raf and Akt3 targeting was examined using
Western blotting to measure levels of protein expression involved
in proliferation (cyclin D1) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3).
Control UACC 903 cells had high cyclin D1 and low cleaved
caspase-3 levels (Fig. 6B, lane 1). In contrast, siRNA-mediated
inhibition of Akt3 increased cleaved caspase-3 levels, indicating
increased cellular apoptosis (Fig. 6B, lane 2). B-Raf siRNA did not
significantly alter levels of cleaved caspase 3 but did significantly
decreased cyclin D1 levels with a corresponding increase in p27
(Fig. 6B, lanes 3–5). Significantly, inhibition of both Akt3 and

mutant V600EB-Raf dramatically increased levels of cleaved caspase
3, indicative of high apoptosis compared with cells in which Akt3
alone had been inhibited (Fig. 6B, lanes 6, 7, and 8 versus lane 2).
Furthermore, the combination approach led to more dramatic
decrease in cyclin D1 than observed when V600EB-Raf was inhibited
alone. Thus, simultaneously targeting both Akt3 and V600EB-Raf has
a more dramatic effect on the signaling cascades of these pathways
than inhibiting each individually.

Discussion
Nevi or moles are benign proliferations of melanocytes that
initially proliferated and then stopped growing (30). Approximately
90% harbor activating B-Raf mutations but never progress into
melanomas (12, 14, 15). This is caused by cellular senescence
associated with high MAPK pathway activity due to presence of
V600E
B-Raf, which is linked to induction of cdk kinase inhibitors,
such as p21Cip1, p16Ink4a, and p27Kip1, functioning as a defense
mechanism of normal cells to overcome oncogene activation

B-Raf Cooperate in Melanoma Development

Figure 5. Targeting V600EB-Raf and
Akt3 dramatically retards melanoma
tumorigenesis. A, nucleofection of siRNA
against both B-Raf and Akt3 into UACC
903 cells led to a statistically significant
reduction of tumor development in animals.
The cells were nucleofected with siRNA,
allowed to recover in culture for 1.5 d,
and then injected s.c. into nude mice.
Tumor size was measured on alternate
days up to day 17.5. Inhibition of Akt3
or B-Raf alone led to a significant reduction
in growth compared with controls;
however, targeting both proteins led to an
even more dramatic reduction compared
with targeting Akt3 or B-Raf individually.

C, Western blot of UACC 903 tumors

(26, 28, 29). In contrast, moderate levels of MAPK pathway activation promote cell cycle progression and cancer development
(27). Therefore, cells containing V600EB-Raf require additional
genetic changes for senescent melanocytic cells to reenter the cell
cycle (31).
Identification of proteins cooperating with V600EB-Raf in
melanocytic transformation are being characterized by studying
nevi development using transgenic zebrafish (30). Prolonged
hyperactivation of MAPK signaling in zebrafish melanocytes
mediated by V600EB-Raf initially promote cellular growth and
development of structures resembling nevi followed by a senescent
phase, a situation comparable with that occurring with most
human moles (30). Zebrafish nevi did not develop into melanomas
until p53 was deleted, suggesting deregulation of multiple
pathways for melanocytic tumor progression (30). Thus, genes
such as Akt3 with prominent roles in the development of f70% of
melanomas likely cooperate with V600EB-Raf in melanocytic
transformation (7, 9, 39, 44, 50).
Akt had been shown to regulate B-Raf activity (34, 35); however,
it was unknown whether Akt3 would phosphorylate mutant V600EBRaf and, if so, whether this process played any role in melanoma

development. In this report, using a combination of pharmacologic
and genetic approaches, Akt3 was shown to down-regulate V600EBRaf-mediated activation of MAPK pathway signaling to promote
tumor progression. Ectopic expression of active Akt3 in early
melanoma cells, phenotypically resembling nevi cells by containing
V600E
B-Raf with low endogenous Akt3 activity, increased anchorageindependent growth. Furthermore, expression of both proteins in
melanocytes promoted anchorage-independent growth, demonstrating that V600EB-Raf and active Akt3 act cooperatively together
to promote melanocyte transformation; thereby, confirming the
importance of these proteins in early melanoma development.
Mechanistically, Akt3 was shown to directly phosphorylate B-Raf
on serine residues 364 and 428 to regulate activity of mutant
V600E
B-Raf protein to promote melanocyte transformation (41).
This second role for Akt in melanoma development was confirmed
by inhibiting the downstream target of Akt3-regulating apoptosis,
called PRAS40 (9). Constitutively active Akt3 was expressed to
activate the signaling cascade, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown was used to inhibit PRAS40 expression/activity. Because
similar anchorage-independent growth was observed irrespective
of levels of PRAS40 expression, deregulated apoptosis mediated by

Figure 6. Simultaneously targeting V600EB-Raf
and Akt3 inhibits in vitro melanoma growth in an
additively cooperating manner. A, in vitro anchorageindependent growth of UACC 903 cells nucleofected
with siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 in cell
culture medium containing 0% serum. UACC 903
cells nucleofected with siRNA were plated onto
PolyHEMA-coated 96-well plates, allowed to grow
for 3 d in DMEM containing no serum and cell viability
quantified by MTS assay. UACC 903 cells nucleofected
with no siRNA (lane 1) was set as 100% and others
compared with this value. Targeting both B-Raf and
Akt3 resulted in statistically significant inhibition of
growth compared with cells in which B-Raf or Akt3 had
been targeted individually. B, Western blots showing
effects of targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 on cyclin D1,

active Akt3 was not leading to enhanced anchorage-independent
growth. Thus, a second important role has been identified for Akt3
in melanoma development.
Melan-a mouse melanocytes used as a model of transformation
are considered to be a normal mouse melanocyte cell line and is
an accepted model for studying V600EB-Raf-mediated transformation (47). However, it lacks p16INK4a as well as alternative reading
frame (ARF) protein expression. Data presented in this study
show that melan-a transformation mediated by V600EB-Raf
expression in a p16INK4a/ARF null background requires expression
of active Akt3 to promote anchorage-independent growth. This
suggests that not only was loss of p16INK4a/ARF important in
bypassing V600EB-Raf induced senescence, but Akt3 activation was

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

required to phosphorylate V600EB-Raf to modulate the level of
MAPK activity.
The therapeutic potential of simultaneously targeting Akt3 and
V600E
B-Raf is also shown in this study. Tumor inhibition was most
significant in animals containing cells in which both proteins had
been targeted. In vitro studies confirmed the effects of the
combination approach, demonstrating that targeting both led to
cooperatively acting inhibition significantly increasing cellular
apoptosis and decreasing proliferation. Thus, therapeutics targeting both pathways in human patients is predicted to be more
effective than targeting each individually.
In conclusion, Akt3 has been shown to cooperate with V600EB-Raf
in promoting melanoma development by phosphorylating the

mutant protein to decrease its activity to levels that promote rather
than inhibit melanocytic cell growth. Furthermore, simultaneously
targeting both Akt3 and V600EB-Raf was more effective at inhibiting
melanomas than inhibiting each individually, which suggest that
therapies for human patients should simultaneously target these
signaling pathways for maximal clinical efficacy.
