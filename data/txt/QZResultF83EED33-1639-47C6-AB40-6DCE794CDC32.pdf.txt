Abstract

HHMI Author Manuscript

SUMMARY—Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft-tissue sarcoma with molecular and cellular features
of developing skeletal muscle. Rhabdomyosarcoma has two major histological subtypes,
embryonal and alveolar, each with distinct clinical, molecular, and genetic features. Genomic
analysis show that embryonal tumors have more structural and copy number variations than
alveolar tumors. Mutations in the RAS/NF1 pathway are significantly associated with
intermediate- and high-risk embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas (ERMS). In contrast, alveolar
rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) have fewer genetic lesions overall and no known recurrently mutated
cancer consensus genes. To identify therapeutics for ERMS, we developed and characterized
orthotopic xenografts of tumors that were sequenced in our study. High throughput screening of
primary cultures derived from those xenografts identified oxidative stress as a pathway of
therapeutic relevance for ERMS.

INTRODUCTION

HHMI Author Manuscript

Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma of childhood and adolescence
(Reis et al., 1999). Using contemporary multimodal therapies, more than 75% of patients
with localized disease are cured (Crist et al., 2001). However, despite the availability of new
agents and intensification of therapy, patients with recurrent or metastatic
rhabdomyosarcoma experience 5-year survival rates of only 17% or 30%, respectively
(Pappo et al., 1999). Rhabdomyosarcoma can be divided into two broad histopathologic
subtypes: embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), which accounts for about 60% of all
rhabdomyosarcomas, and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS), which accounts for about
25%(Newton et al., 1988). The remaining cases are classified as mixed, unspecified or
undifferentiated sarcomas(Rudzinski et al., 2013). Patients with ERMS have a relatively
good prognosis, and the tumors are characterized by the loss of heterozygosity at the 11p15
locus(Ognjanovic et al., 2009; Scrable et al., 1989). In contrast, patients with ARMS have an
inferior clinical outcome, and their tumors are often characterized by a translocation
between the FOXO1 gene on chromosome 13q14 and either PAX3 on chromosome 2q35 or
PAX7 on chromosome 1p36(Barr, 1997; Raney et al., 2001).
Current treatment protocols for rhabdomyosarcoma are designed to deliver risk-based
therapy (low, intermediate, or high) based exclusively on the clinical and pathologic features
at the time of initial presentation(Malempati and Hawkins, 2012). However, the outcome for
an individual child, particularly one with intermediate-risk disease features, is still difficult
to predict. This indicates that clinical and pathologic features alone are imprecise, and
biologic signatures within clinical subgroups might offer a more reliable method for
predicting outcome and assigning risk-based or targeted therapies(Davicioni et al., 2010).

In this study, we characterized the genomic, epigenomic, molecular and cellular features of
rhabdomyosarcoma and integrated those data with drug sensitivity data to identify druggable
pathways for this devastating pediatric cancer.

RESULTS
Sequencing of Rhabdomyosarcoma
We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis on 16 rhabdomyosarcoma tumors
from 13 patients and on matched normal tissue. Nine of the patients had ERMS, and 4 had
ARMS. The distribution of patient age, sex, race, primary site, and stage reflected the
clinical heterogeneity of the disease. We also sequenced 3 recurrent tumor samples from 2
ERMS patients (Table S1).
Using a paired-end–sequencing approach, we generated 4,529 Gb of sequence data for the
samples described; 4,260 Gb (94%) were successfully mapped to the reference genome
(Table S2). The average genome coverage was 42×, and the average exon coverage was
37×; 99% of SNPs detected across all 29 genomes showed concordance with their
corresponding SNP array genotype calls at the same genomic positions (Table S2). We also
performed RNA sequencing on 15 of the 16 tumors used for WGS (Table S2).

HHMI Author Manuscript

All somatic alterations including sequence mutations and structural variations (SVs) were
experimentally validated by custom-capture technology and Illumina sequencing. We
identified 22,123 validated somatic sequence mutations and 1,275 validated SVs across the
16 tumors (Table S2). These included 409 nonsilent tier-1 mutations in genes, 1,980 tier-2
mutations in regulatory regions or evolutionarily conserved regions of the genome, 19,202
tier-3 mutations in nonrepetitive regions of the genome that are not part of tiers 1 or 2 (Table
S2). The average number of sequence mutations was 1,382.7 per case (range, 290-3,135),
with 25.6 mutations per case (range, 5-65) resulting in amino acid changes (Table S2). The
average number of validated SVs was 79.7 per case (range, 2-299). The estimated mean
background mutation rate was 1.06×10−6 per base (range, 2.35×10−7–2.42×10−6). We also
identified and validated 22 SVs that are predicted to produce an in-frame fusion protein in
our discovery cohort (Table S2). RNA sequencing revealed that 8 of those predicted inframe fusions were expressed in the tumors (Table S2). The majority (5/8) of the expressed
in-frame fusion transcripts were the result of the PAX3/7-FOXO1 translocations in ARMS
tumors. The other 3 transcripts were FGFR1- WHSC1L1 in SJRHB001, NSD1-ZNF346 in
SJRHB011, and a 2.7 kb intra-genic deletion in COL4A2 in SJRHB002 (Table S2 and
Figure S1A-S1C). These results show that despite an overall high number of SVs in ERMS
cases, very few resulted in functional fusion genes.

Copy Number Variations and Structural Variations in Rhabdomyosarcoma
Previous aCGH studies have shown that ARMS tumors tend to have fewer copy number
variants (CNVs) than do ERMS tumors(Williamson et al., 2010). We found a trend toward
increased SVs and CNVs in ERMS, compared to those in ARMS, in our discovery cohort,
but SV data did not achieve statistical significance because of the small number of ARMS
tumors (Figures 1A and 1B). SVs and CNVs can be caused by the gradual, progressive
accumulation of chromosomal and regional lesions during each round of cell division, or
they may be caused by a single acute event such as chromothripsis (Stephens et al., 2011).
We found no evidence of chromothripsis in the 16 rhabdomyosarcoma tumors in our
discovery cohort (Data not shown, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details).
Instead, the multi-level CNVs in genomic regions with multiple complex SVs suggested
accumulation of sequential chromosomal lesions rather than a single acute event (Figure
1C).

The background mutation rate (BMR) and overall number of single-nucleotide variants
(SNVs) was significantly higher in ERMS tumors than in ARMS tumors (Figure 1C).
Mutation spectrum estimated using validated SNVs throughout the whole genome (Figures
S1D and S1E) indicated that ERMS tumors had significantly more G→T SNVs than did
ARMS tumors (26.7% vs 19.9%, p = 0.031), and the combined proportion of G→T
transversions in rhabdomyosarcoma (24.9%) was higher than that found in T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and medulloblastoma (MB) (T-ALL + MB: 17.8%, p =
0.0003)(Robinson et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012) but lower than that found in lung cancer
(32.7%, p=0.00014)(2012). Oxidative stress stimulated p38 MAPKs and consistent with this
observation, MAKP12 expression was significantly higher in ERMS compared to ARMS
(FDR = 0.02, 2.1-fold change). In addition, MAP2K6 was overexpressed in ERMS (FDR =
0.0003, 3.3-fold change). Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that
oxidative stress contributes to the SNVs identified in rhabdomyosarcomas.
Intratumoral Heterogeneity and Clonal Evolution in ERMS Recurrence

HHMI Author Manuscript

As a first step to analyze intratumor heterogeneity in the discovery cohort, the tumor purity
(ratio of tumor cells to all cells) was estimated from the WGS data. For each tumor, regions
of the genome that had copy number alterations (CNAs) and corresponding changes in their
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) were surveyed to identify the maximum proportional
representation of a somatic lesion in the tumor. We were able to estimate the tumor purity in
15 of the 16 tumors (ranged from 67% to 98% in our discovery cohort, Figure S2C). Next,
we analyzed intratumor heterogeneity using the purity adjusted mutant allele frequency
(MAF) derived from deep sequencing of all SNVs by capture enrichment and Illumina
sequencing. We excluded SJRHB013 in this analysis because of low tumor purity. The
majority of tumors (13/15) had tumor purity adjusted MAF peaks corresponding to 0.5
indicating that the tumor purity estimates from CNAs and LOH analysis is accurate (Figure
S2). Using somatic SNVs found in the diploid chromosomal regions, we found that there
was a major MAF peak around 0.25 for 3 of the samples (SJRHB001, SJRHB009 and
SJRHB004). These data suggest that there are relatively few mutations in the founding clone
and a subclone representing ~50% of the tumor has the majority of SNVs. Overall, 10 of the
15 tumors had evidence of significant intratumor heterogeneity and two of the tumors
(SJRHB004 and SJRHB011_D) had more than 2 subclones (Figure S2).

HHMI Author Manuscript

To characterize the clonal evolution(Nowell, 1976) of ERMS following treatment, we
analyzed tumors from 2 patients who had diagnostic and recurrent tumors sequenced along
with their matching normal germline genomes. In the case SJRHB011, a recurrent tumor
sample (SJRHB011_D) was compared to the diagnostic tumor isolated 15 months earlier
(SJRHB011_E) (Figure 2A-2C). In the case SJRHB012, tumor samples from 2 recurrent
sites (SJRHB012_R and SJRHB012_S) that were collected at the same time were compared
to the primary tumor (SJRHB012_D) isolated 14 months earlier (Figure 2D-2F). In both
cases, the patients received chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgical resection of the
recurrent tumors. We designed a single capture chip for each patient that included all tier 1-4
predicted mutations in primary and recurrent tumors from their corresponding WGS
analysis. Deep sequencing of the captured DNA allowed us to calculate the MAFs for all
SNVs across each of these 5 tumor samples. This approach allowed us to distinguish de
novo SNVs that arose in the recurrent samples from mutations that were present at low
frequencies in the primary tumor and were missed due to intratumor heterogeneity and/or
limited coverage of the WGS.
In SJRHB011, there were 3,524 SNVs with sufficient coverage for our analysis and we
focused on 841 heterozygous mutations in diploid regions of the genome without LOH.
There were 4 major clusters (A-D) (Figure 3A). Cluster A SNVs are found in cells that were

Chen et al.

present in the major clone in both primary (MAF=0.49) and recurrent (MAF=0.53) tumors.
Cluster B SNVs are found in cells in the major clone of the recurrent tumor but not the
primary tumor. Cluster C SNVs are present in the recurrent tumor in a subclone and Cluster
D SNVs were present in the majority of cells in the primary tumor but were lost in the
recurrent sample after chemotherapy (Figure 3A). At diagnosis, there was a major clone
(clone 2) and a minor clone (clone 1) contributing 97% and 3% to the tumor, respectively
(Figure 3B). Following treatment, the major clone (clone 2) was eliminated and some of the
cells from the minor clone (clone 1) acquired additional SNVs (clone 3) to seed the recurrent
tumor. This recurrent tumor then further evolved into two major clones (clone 3 and clone 4)
contributing 66% and 34% to the tumor, respectively (Figure 3B).

HHMI Author Manuscript

A similar analysis was performed for SJRHB012 using 1,049 validated SNVs in diploid
regions of the genome without LOH. For this tumor, there were 6 clusters of SNVs (Figure
3C). Cluster A SNVs are present in all 3 tumor samples (diagnostic and two recurrent sites)
from this patient (Figure 3C,3D). Cluster B SNVs were present in virtually all tumor cells at
both recurrent sites but absent from the primary tumor (Figure 3D). These mutations were
likely acquired early during progression prior to spreading to the secondary sites. An ALK
mutation (P1445H) is one of the mutations in this cluster. Cluster C SNVs were absent from
the diagnostic tumor but were present at one site of recurrence (pelvis) as the dominant
clone and at the other site (prostate) as a minor clone (Figure 3D). Cluster D and Cluster E
SNVs were unique to the pelvic or prostate recurrent sites, respectively. Cluster F SNVs
were found in the dominant clone in the primary tumor but were lost following treatment
(Figure 3D).
Similar to SJRHB011, the recurrent tumors in SJRHB012 were derived from the founding
minor clone (clone 1) after acquiring additional mutations, including the ALKP1445H
mutation (clone 3). A fraction of the clone 3 cells acquired additional mutations and became
clone 4. Both clones 3 and 4 seeded the 2 recurrent tumor sites and continued to evolve
(clone 5 and 6). Taken together, these data highlight the complex genetic changes and clonal
evolution that occur in ERMS tumors following treatment.
SJRHB011, 012 and 013 Xenografts

HHMI Author Manuscript

To begin to study ALK and other signaling pathways that may be perturbed in primary and
recurrent ERMS, we developed and characterized 6 orthotopic xenografts derived from the
diagnostic and recurrent samples for SJRHB011 and SJRHB012 and from the post-treatment
SJRHB013 tumor specimen. Immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy
confirmed that the cellular features of the patient’s tumors were preserved in the xenografts
in immunocompromised mice (Figure 4A,4B and Figure S3A-S3F). SNP 6.0 analysis,
exome sequencing, RNA-seq and DNA methylation analysis confirmed that these xenografts
closely recapitulate the molecular features of their primary tumors (Figure 4C-4F and Figure
S3A-S3F). There was no correlation between acquisition of the ALKP1445H mutation and
ALK protein levels in SJRHB012 (Figure S3F, S3G). To test the sensitivity of these ERMS
xenograft tumor cells to ALK inhibitors and other therapeutics, we developed and validated
a short-term culture protocol that was amenable to high-throughput screening. There was no
relationship between ALK mutation status and sensitivity to ALK inhibitors for SJRHB012
or the other ERMS xenografts (SJRHB011 and SJRHB013) (Figure S3H).
Recurrent Mutations in Genes Implicated in Muscle Development and Homeostasis
It has been proposed that rhabdomyosarcomas may arise from multipotent mesenchymal
progenitor cells, muscle progenitor cells, or muscle stem cells (satellite cells) (Hettmer and
Wagers, 2010). These possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible that ERMS
and ARMS may have distinct cellular origins. To explore muscle-differentiation pathways in

ERMS and ARMS, we performed network analysis, as previously described (Hu et al.,
2012; Zhang and Horvath, 2005), using published gene expression data for ERMS and
ARMS tumors (Davicioni et al., 2010; Williamson et al., 2010). The WNT and sonic
hedgehog (SHH) pathways differed significantly between the two rhabdomyosarcoma
subtypes. To validate and extend those data, we extended our RNA-Seq analysis to 32
tumors including the 15 samples from the discovery cohort described above. We also
performed DNA methylation analysis using the Illumina 450k BeadChip on 32 tumors (20
ERMS and 12 ARMS) (Figure S4A and Table S3). Several genes in the WNT and SHH
pathways were differentially expressed and a subset of those were differentially methylated
(Table S4). We did not identify any recurrent gene mutations in the SHH pathway in our
discovery cohort, but we did identify β-catenin–activating mutations in the WNT pathway in
SJRHB004 and SJRHB005 (Figure 5A). Tumors with β-catenin activating mutations
accumulated nuclear β-catenin protein in contrast to those that expressed wild-type β-catenin
(Figure 5B). We extended our immunohistochemical analysis of β-catenin and found that
20% (6/30) of ERMS had some evidence of nuclear localization and 0% (0/17) of ARMS
had evidence of nuclear β-catenin (Table S1). The nuclear β-catenin expression was
heterogeneous, ranging from rare cells to extensive (3+) staining within the tumor tissue
(Table S1).

HHMI Author Manuscript

To estimate the frequency of mutations identified in our discovery cohort, we performed
targeted resequencing of all exons for 139 of those genes with mutations in an additional
cohort comprising 21 ERMS, 13 ARMS, and 3 unspecified tumors (Table S5).
Approximately half of the tumors had no mutations in any of the 139 genes, so we
performed exome sequencing on a subset (28/36) of the tumors (Table S5). All mutations
identified in this subset were validated using nextgen amplicon sequencing.

HHMI Author Manuscript

To determine if any of the muscle-specification or -differentiation pathways were mutated in
rhabdomyosarcomas, we analyzed the distribution of mutations in genes that are enriched in
developing muscle compared to other human tissues. We selected all genes that were
enriched by at least 4 fold in 1 of the 3 cell populations (myoblast, myotube, or skeletal
muscle) for a total of 1,295 genes. We identified 130 mutations across 101 genes from our
group of muscle-enriched genes in the discovery and validation cohorts. Nine of those genes
(ANKRD10, COL4A3, DMD, KLHL4, LTBP1, MIB1, MYOD1, P2RX6, and SYNE2) were
mutated in 2 independent tumor samples, and TTN was mutated in 3 samples (Table S6).
Four genes (CTNNA3, MACF1, MAP3K5, and MEF2A) had 2 different mutations in the
same patient’s tumor (Table S6). Overall, 70% (19/27) of the ERMS and 44% (8/18) of the
ARMS had a mutation in at least 1 of the 1,295 muscle-enriched genes in our analysis, but
we detected no statistically significant enrichment in mutations in the muscle-development/
differentiation pathways. Taken together, these data on the mutational landscape of ERMS
and ARMS do not provide any additional evidence about cellular origins for these tumors.
The most common chromosomal alteration in rhabdomyosarcoma is the gain of
chromosome 8 in ERMS tumors(Williamson et al., 2010). We analyzed the gene expression
in ERMS tumors with chromosome 8 gains in comparison to those without chromosome 8
gains. Overall, there was a slight increase in expression of genes on chromosome 8 in the
ERMS tumors with chromosomal gains (Figure S4B). However, none of the individual
genes on chromosome 8 were significantly upregualted in the tumors with chromosome 8
gain. There were 7 genes on other chromosomes with significantly different expression
(FDR≤ 0.05) in the ERMS tumors with chromosome 8 gains compared to those without
chromosome 8 gains. Among those genes, MICU1, MCU, MAMDC2 and ISL1 were altered
by ≥ 2-fold (Figure S4C). MCU is a calcium uniporter in mitochrondria and MICU1 is an
EF-hand protein that is the key regulator of MCU. Both MCU and MICU1 are
downregulated in ERMS tumors with chromosome 8 gains. Previous studies have suggested

that perturbations in MCU/MICU1 expression may lead to changes in oxidative metabolism
and sensitization to calcium overload (Csordas et al., 2013). These data may particularly
relevant to rhabdomyosarcoma because of the features of muscle differentiation in this
tumor and the role of calcium in muscle contraction.

Recurrent Gene Mutations in Cancer Consensus Pathways

HHMI Author Manuscript

Combined sequence analyses demonstrated recurrent genetic lesions (SNVs, indels, and
SVs) in 8 cancer consensus genes (NRAS, KRAS, TP53, NF1, RARA, CTNNB1, CARD11,
and PIK3CA), as well as the expected PAX3/7-FOXO1 translocations in ARMS tumors
(Figure 6A). One ERMS tumor (SJRHB026) also had an oncogenic HRAS mutation. All but
one of the cancer consensus gene mutations were found in ERMS, and 15% (4/27) of ERMS
had multiple cancer consensus gene mutations (Figure 6A). Cancer consensus gene
mutations were validated in 88% (7/8) of the high-risk ERMS tumors, 73% (7/11) of the
intermediate-risk, and 20% (2/10) of the low-risk. The most common cancer consensus gene
mutations were in the RAS pathway (NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, and NF1) (Figure 6A,6B and
Table 1). When we combined the discovery and validation cohorts, 75% (6/8) of high-risk
ERMS tumors had RAS pathway mutations, 45% (5/11) of intermediate-risk, and 0% (0/10)
of low-risk (Table 1); thus, RAS pathway mutations had a significant association with
ERMS risk group classification (p=0.00015). KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, and NF1 gene mutations
were rarely found in combination with other cancer consensus gene mutations, and they
were never found in ARMS.

HHMI Author Manuscript

In our cohort, TP53 gene mutations were accompanied by FGFR4 mutations (Figure 6A,
6C, 6D and Table 1). In addition to TP53 gene mutations, we also performed detailed
analysis of CNVs for TP53, MDM2, MDM4 and CDKN2A using the WGS and SNP 6.0 data
and combined those data with RNA-sequence data, p53 IHC and fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) analysis of all 4 loci (Table S7 and Figure S5A). There were 4 ERMS
samples (SJRHB003, SJRHB011, SJRHB049 and SJRHB059) with SNVs in TP53, and all 4
had elevated nuclear accumulation of p53 protein (Figure S5B). One ERMS tumors
(SJRHB016) had a homozygous deletion of TP53 with reduced gene expression (Table S7).
One of the ERMS tumors (SJRHB012) and one of the ARMS tumors (SJRHB054) had focal
MDM2 gains (>100 copies and 14 copies, respectively) with increased MDM2 gene
expression and one of the ERMS tumors (SJRHB020) had focal homozygous deletion of
CDKN2A with reduced gene expression (Table S7 and Fig. S5). There was one ERMS
sample (SJRHB002) with a gain of MDM4 (3-5 copies in 33% of the cells) (Figure S5C) but
there was no increase in gene expression (Table S7). Overall, by combining WGS, exome
sequencing, SNP 6.0 analysis, transcriptome analysis, p53 IHC and FISH analysis,
mutations in the p53 pathway were more common in ERMS (8/31) than ARMS (1/14).
There were no mutations in TP53 or CDKN2A in our ARMS cohort.
Previous gene expression array analysis of ERMS and ARMS tumors led to the
identification of a 34 metagene expression signature that is predictive of overall survival for
rhabdomyosarcoma(Davicioni et al., 2010). We used RNA sequence data for 32 tumors
from the discovery and validation cohorts to rank the tumors based on their 34 metagene
signature (Table S8). There was no significant association of RAS pathway mutations with
34-metagene rank in our cohort and a larger study will be required to establish the
prognostic significance of RAS pathway mutations in intermediate risk ERMS patients.
Targeting Oxidative Stress and Ras Pathways in ERMS
Skeletal muscle cells have unique energy metabolism because of their aerobic capacity and
ability to rapidly adapt for short-term anaerobic activity. As a result of their unique
metabolic properties, muscle cells also have a robust antioxidant defense system to protect

the DNA, lipids and proteins from the deleterious effects of excess reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Cancer cells also have elevated ROS due to their increased metabolic activity,
oncogenic stimulation (i.e. RAS) and mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, we reasoned
that rhabdomyosarcomas may be particularly susceptible to therapeutics that increase ROS
or target the cells ability to protect against oxidative stress. In addition, the association of
RAS pathway mutations with ERMS risk group provided an additional pathway for
interventions using molecular targeted therapy. To test the efficacy of therapeutics that
target these two pathways, we developed a method to perform acute short-term cultures with
the primary rhabdomyosarcoma orthotopic xenografts described above. Briefly, the tumor
cells are injected into the flank muscle of immunocompromised mice in matrigel and several
weeks later when the tumor mass is palpable, they are isolated and dispersed into a single
cell suspension (Figure 7A-7C). The cells can be grown for up to 96 hours in muscle
differentiation medium in 384 well dishes with reproducible survival and growth kinetics.
Next, we developed a custom compound library with 207 compounds including FDA
approved drugs, molecules in clinical development and well-characterized small molecule
with biological activity (Table S9). The library included chemotherapeutics used to treat
pediatric cancer, agents that perturb the oxidative stress pathway and molecules that target
the Ras pathway. The library was screened in dose response in triplicate against each of the
6 xenografts and several rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines (Table S9). As a positive control, we
used staurosporine and as a negative control we used DMSO at the same concentration in
the drug treated wells. There was robust separation between the positive and negative
controls and the mean z’ was between 0.48 and 0.81 across the experiments (Table S10 and
Figure S6A, S6B). Overall, the xenografts were less sensitive to the agents in the targeted
library than the cell lines (Figure 7D). None of the drugs that target the Ras pathway had
significant activity against the xenografts including the tumor that had an NRAS mutation
(SJRHB013). We also included molecules that target the PI3K pathway because of the
interplay between the Ras and PI3K pathways(Gysin et al., 2011). None of these agents had
significant activity except for the dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor BGT-226 (Figure 7D,7E).
There are now several clinical trials testing the combination of PI3K inhibitors and Ras
pathway inhibitors so we tested the combination of BGT-226 with all of the drugs in our
library. Even these combinations failed to show significant increase in cytotoxicity for our
ERMS xenografts (Table S9). These data are consistent with phosphoprotein analysis for the
Ras and PI3K pathways (Figure S6C, S6D) showing little if any deregulation of those
pathways in our xenografts.

In contrast to compounds targeting Ras and PI3K pathways, the agents that targeted
oxidative stress were more active. The HDAC inhibitors were active as a class with
panobinostat showing the most activity (Figure 7D, 7E). In addition, carfilzomib, auranofin,
cerivastatin, alvocidib and ouabain showed significant activity against the ERMS
xenografts. Each of these drugs can increase oxidative stress and several have been shown to
be synergistic by targeting oxidative stress and inducing mitochondrial cell death (discussed
below). Taken together, these data suggest that drugs that increase oxidative stress and ROS
production in ERMS cells may be effective for the treatment of diagnostic and recurrent
ERMS tumors.

DISCUSSION
Genetic Landscape of Rhabdomyosarcoma
It has been previously shown that chromosome 8 was gained in 74% of ERMS
tumors(Williamson et al., 2010). We identified chromosome 8 gains in 92% (11/12) of the
ERMS tumors and we found that two genes on chromosome 10 that control calcium uptake
in mitochondria (MCU, MICU1) are downregulated in the tumors with chromosome 8 gain.

This may indicate that there is a negative regulator of MCU and MICU1 on chromosome 8.
In a separate aCGH study of 26 ERMS tumors, CDKN2A-homozygous deletions were found
in 23% (6/26) of tumors and heterozygous deletion through loss of chromosome 9p in most
of the remaining tumors (Paulson et al., 2011). In our cohort, we identified 1 ERMS tumor
showing CDKN2A-homozygous loss (8%), and 1 other ERMS tumor showing a
heterozygous deletion. We did not find any CDKN2A mutations in ARMS tumors. We also
analyzed the other key genes in the p53 pathway including TP53, MDM4 and MDM2. In
total, mutations in the p53 pathway were identified in 19% of the ERMS tumors (6/31) and
7% (1/14) of ARMS tumors. This difference between the 2 studies may be due, in part, to
the larger number of low-risk ERMS tumors in our study.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Paulson et al. also reported patterns of activation of the RAS pathway by oncogenic
mutation in HRAS, KRAS, or NRAS (42%, 12/26) or by homozygous deletions of NF1 (15%,
4/26)15. These data are consistent with that from 3 other studies showing RAS pathway
mutations in 35% (5/14), 22% (7/31)(Martinelli et al., 2009; Stratton et al., 1989) and 11.7%
(Shukla et al., 2012) of ERMS tumors. In our study, 58% (11/19) of the high-risk and
intermediate-risk ERMS tumors had RAS pathway mutations, and RAS pathway mutations
were significantly associated with risk group assignment (p=0.0015). None of the ARMS
tumors in our discovery or validation cohorts (17 specimens) had RAS pathway mutations or
TP53/FGFR4 gene mutations. A much larger cohort of ERMS tumors will be needed to
determine the incidence and significance of RAS pathway mutations with respect to overall
survival.
The only cancer consensus gene that was mutated in our ARMS cohort was PIKC3A in 1
sample (SJRHB008). There was also one ERMS tumor with a PIKC3A mutation
(SJRHB057). One of the mutations (H1047R) is a hotspot mutation and the other (N345K)
is a rare mutation that has been shown to be oncogenic in cell culture(Gymnopoulos et al.,
2007). These data suggest that multiple cancer consensus pathways are mutated in ERMS
and the PAX3/7-FOXO1 translocation is the major oncogenic driver in ARMS.

In a previous study comparing genetically engineered mouse models of rhabdomyosarcoma
to primary human tumors, Keller and colleagues analyzed the p53, SHH, RB and RAS
pathways by comparing their gene expression signatures (Rubin et al., 2011). They
concluded that fusion negative rhabdomyosarcomas (ERMS) with a RAS signature always
had perturbations in at least one other pathway (SHH, RB or P53). No other genetic or
histological data was presented in that study to confirm the findings. This is important
because signaling through these pathways is complex and using a metagene approach may
not accurately identify pathway perturbations. This is particularly true for the Ras pathway
that is regulated primarily at the level of protein phosphorylation rather than gene
expression.
In our characterization of the genomic landscape of rhabdomyosarcoma, we did not find
significant overlap of mutations in the p53, Shh, Rb and Ras pathways. However, we cannot
rule out the possibility of non-genetic factors contributing to pathway perturbations and
more comprehensive integration of genetic and epigenetic profiles will help to resolve this
discrepancy. Indeed, our data suggest that several genes that regulate the RAS pathway or
similar receptor tyrosine kinase pathways are differentially methylated in
rhabdomyosarcomas including THEM4, DAB2, KSR1, ELMO1, SH3D19, NCK2 and JAK1.
Developmental Pathways in Rhabdomyosarcoma
Rhabdomyosarcomas express multiple genes and pathways characteristic of muscle cell
differentiation, and electron microscopic analysis of ERMS and ARMS tumors has
demonstrated that tumor cells have features of skeletal muscle including myofibers (Skalli et

al., 1988). Our analysis of previously published gene-expression array data revealed that
expression of genes in the SHH and WNT pathways differ significantly between ERMS and
ARMS tumors and our RNA-Seq and DNA methylation analysis provided additional
validation. No mutations in the hedgehog pathway were found in our cohort but we
identified β-catenin–activating mutations in 7% (2/29) of ERMS tumors, and nuclear
accumulation of β-catenin in 20% (6/30). In a recent study(Shukla et al., 2012), CTNNB1
mutations were identified in 2/60 ERMS tumors but there was no validation of nuclear
accumulation of β-catenin. The nuclear accumulation of β-catenin was heterogeneous and in
tumor sample SJRHB004, the β-catenin–activating mutation was in a minor clone, and in
SJRHB005, it was present in the major clone. There was no evidence of activation of WNT
signaling in ARMS tumors in our cohort. Previous studies in mice have shown that β-catenin
plays an important developmental stage–specific role in muscle cell development, and
activation of β-catenin can lead to ectopic proliferation(Hutcheson et al., 2009). Activation
of β-catenin is not sufficient to induce tumorigenesis of muscle progenitors or differentiation
of muscle cells in mice, but in combination with other mutations, it may contribute to
tumorigenesis in human rhabdomyosarcoma. Indeed, in our cohort, β-catenin– activating
mutations were found in combination with LRP1B mutations.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Beyond SHH and WNT signaling we identified 101 muscle-enriched genes mutated in
rhabdomyosarcoma. Among those 101 genes, only 8 were recurrently mutated in at least 2
tumor samples, and 1 (TTN) was recurrently mutated in 3 samples. The TTN gene is one of
the largest genes in the genome, and it is mutated in most pediatric solid tumors; thus, it is
difficult to assess the functional significance of TTN mutations in rhabdomyosarcoma. A
much larger study will be required to elucidate the significance of mutations in genes
implicated in muscle development or differentiation. Our DNA methylation data also
provided additional insight into muscle development pathways that may be deregulated in
rhabdomyosarcoma including LBX1, FOXK1, ZFHX3, MEF2D, HOXD3, ZFP42, DLK2,
MYF5 and FHL3.
Intratumor heterogeneity and Clonal Evolution of Rhabdomyosarcoma
We identified significant intratumor heterogeneity in 10/15 of the tumors and 2 of them had
multiple clones. Interestingly, 3 of the tumors had a founding clone with relatively few
SNVs and the majority of SNVs in the tumor were present in a clone that grew out of that
clone. There was no difference between ARMS and ERMS tumors with respect to tumor
heterogeneity.

HHMI Author Manuscript

We included two patients in our discovery cohort that had diagnostic and recurrent tumors to
begin to explore the clonal evolution(Nowell, 1976) of ERMS after treatment. This is of
particular interest because the overall survival for patients with recurrent
rhabdomyosarcoma is less than 30% and nothing is known about how the tumors evolve in
the context of current standard of care therapy. Our analysis suggests that chemotherapy can
completely eliminate the major clone in a diagnostic tumor and a minor subclone can then
seed the recurrent tumor following therapy and continue to acquire mutations. Thus, not
only are the two ERMS tumors in our analysis complex with respect to tumor heterogeneity
at diagnosis, but they are significantly different at the time of recurrence and at individual
recurrent sites. These data highlight the importance of performing comprehensive genomic
analyses of diagnostic and recurrent tissue specimens from multiple sites for
rhabdomyosarcoma in order to identify the genetic lesions that contribute to progression and
resistance to therapy and to more effectively identify therapeutic approaches for those
recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma patients. As more targeted agents become available, biopsy of
the recurrent tumor may become an important intervention for selection of therapy since the
mutations present at recurrence may differ from those present at initial diagnosis.

Implications for Preclinical Models of ERMS and ARMS

HHMI Author Manuscript

To model ARMS in the mouse, Keller et al. generated a conditional Pax3-Foxo1 knock-in
mouse line that could be induced to express the Pax3-Foxo1 fusion protein with cell type–
specific Cre expression (Keller et al., 2004). However, expression of the fusion protein was
not sufficient to promote ARMS formation, and only when combined with conditional
inactivation of Trp53 or Cdkn2a did the mice develop ARMS. In our study, none of the
ARMS tumors had TP53 or CDKN2A mutations. Indeed, only one of the 14 ARMS samples
in our cohort had a lesion in the p53 pathway (MDM2 amplification). It is not known if this
species difference reflects a divergence in the cellular origins of the tumor, differences in the
epigenetic landscape of the cell of origin for ARMS across species, or some other cell
autonomous or non–cell autonomous difference that affects tumor initiation or progression.
Our data suggest that conditional activation of the RAS pathway will prove useful for
modeling intermediate- or high-risk ERMS in the mouse, and inactivation of the Trp53 gene
in combination with an activating mutation in Fgfr4 may provide another model of
intermediate- or high-risk ERMS.
Targeting the Oxidative Stress Pathway in ERMS

HHMI Author Manuscript
HHMI Author Manuscript

Skeletal muscle cells and cancer cells have high levels of ROS because of their unique
metabolic demands. Therefore, we reasoned that a cancer with features of skeletal muscle
(rhabdomyosarcoma) may have even higher levels of ROS than other cancer cells and be
particularly sensitive to therapeutics that increase oxidative stress. Indeed, one of the most
active agents for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma (actinomycin-D) increases oxidative
stress(Minai et al., 2013; Tsuruga et al., 2003). The genomic data presented here suggests
that ERMS tumors have elevated ROS because they have higher rates of G→T transversions
and some increase in expression of genes in the p38 MAPK pathway(Wagner and Nebreda,
2009). Also, the majority of ERMS tumors have chromosome 8 gains (92% in our cohort)
and show deregulation of MCU/MICU1 expression which in turn can lead to mitochondrial
dysfunction and oxidative stress(Block and Gorin, 2012). Several genes implicated in
regulation of metabolism, mitochondrial function and oxidative stress were differentially
methylated in rhabdomyosarcomas including PTK2, COX7A1, NOSIP, NOS1, ATP2A3,
DDAH1, GLRX and TXNDC12. In our study, the ERMS xenografts are sensitive to the
thioredoxin reductase inhibitor auranofin (Liu et al., 2012). The thioredoxin pathway is
regulated by epigenetic processes controlled in part by HDACs and one of the cytotoxic
mechanisms of HDAC inhibitors is perturbations in the expression of the thioredoxin
pathway(Butler et al., 2002). Our data on the activity of HDAC inhibitors for the ERMS
xenografts are consistent with this mechanism of action and the susceptibility of the
oxidative stress pathway in these tumors. Two other drugs that show activity against the
ERMS xenografts (carfilzomib and alvocidib) act synergistically with HDAC inhibitors by
targeting mitochondrial function and increasing oxidative stress in cancer cells
(Dasmahapatra et al., 2006; Dasmahapatra et al., 2010; Dasmahapatra et al., 2011; Huang et
al., 2010). Indeed, one of the major mechanisms of action of the HDAC inhibitors is through
changes in expression of thethoredoxin reductase pathway and our data on HDAC inhibitors
as a class is consistent with this hypothesis. Cervistatin is a synthetic statin used to lower
cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular disease. In cardiac myocytes, it is believed that
statins reduce oxidative stress. However, it has been shown that this effect is cell-type
specific and in skeletal muscle, statins can have the opposite effect and increase oxidative
stress contributing to rhabdomyolysis which is a major side effect of statins(Bouitbir et al.,
2012). Cervistatin was withdrawn from the market due to the high rate of deaths and other
side effects related to rhabdomyolysis. Finally, ouabain is a Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor that
can have pleiotropic effects in cells. In myocytes, ouabain can lead to opening of ATPsensitive mitochondrial potassium channels and concomitant increase in ROS (Tian et al.,
2003). Taken together, these genomic, molecular and cellular data suggest that therapeutics

that increase reactive oxygen in rhabdomyosarcoma may be particularly effective and may
contribute synergistically to current standard of care using vincristine, actinomycin and
cyclophosphamide (VAC). The synergistic effects of carfilzomib or alvocidib with HDAC
inhibitors is particularly promising.

Rhabdomyosarcoma Xenografts

HHMI Author Manuscript

Excess, deidentified tumor material was collected from patients with rhabdomyosarcoma at
St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in agreement with local institutional ethical
regulations and IRB approval. Tumor tissue was initially implanted in the flank location of
NSG mice. After sufficient tumor growth, orthotopic xenografts were created by processing
the flank tumor tissue into a single cell suspension by enzymatic dissociation and injection
into the hind leg muscle of CD-1 nude mice. Tumor growth was monitored by manual
palpation. After tumor development, the tumor was harvested and processed using the same
dissociation technique to isolate cells for drug screening.
Orthotopic Xenograft Intramuscular Injection—Rhabdomyosarcoma cells were
suspended in matrigel (BD Worldwide Cat#354234) at a concentration of 1×104 cells per
microliter and placed on ice. Recipient CD-1 nude mice were manually restrained and
injected with 100 μl of cell suspension intramuscularly into the lateral thigh region of the
hind leg.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Rhabdomyosarcoma Tumor Dissociation—Rhabdomyosarcoma tumor tissue was
harvested from CD-1 nude orthotopic xenografts. Tumor was placed through a tumor press
and then rinsed with Dulbecco’s modified eagle media (DMEM, Lonza Cat#12-604F).
Tumor suspension was transferred to a 50 ml conical tube and filled with DMEM.
Dissociation was done by adding 600 μl of trypsin (10 mg/ml, Sigma Cat#T9935) and 50
mg of type II collagenase (275 u/mg,Worthington Cat#4177) and tube placed in 37 degree
water bath for 10 minutes. Dissociation was stopped by adding 600 μl of soybean trypsin
inhibitor (10 mg/ml, Sigma Cat#T6522). Deoxyribonuclease I (2 mg/ml, Sigma Cat#D4513)
and magnesium chloride (1 M) were added in equal amounts in 60 μl increments until tumor
fragments easily settled at the bottom of the tube. Tumor suspension is filtered with a 40 μm
cell strainer and centrifuged at 450g (G=RCF) for 5 minutes. Supernatant is discarded and
10 ml of red blood cell lysis solution (5 Prime Cat#2301310) added and allowed to incubate
at room temperature for 10 minutes. Solution of phosphate buffered saline without calcium
or magnesium (PBS-minus, Lonza Cat#17-516F) /10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Biowest
Cat#SO1520) was added to fill 50 ml conical tube and cell suspension centrifuged at 450g
(G=RCF) for 5 minutes. Supernatant is discarded and cell pellet was resuspended in PBSminus/10%FBS for counting.

SIGNIFICANCE

HHMI Author Manuscript

Our data show that the genetic landscape of ERMS and ARMS are distinct. ARMS have
fewer mutations overall and no recurrent cancer consensus gene mutations. In contrast,
ERMS have a high rate of recurrent mutations in the RAS pathway. We selected six
ERMS patient tumors to generate orthotopic xenografts and optimized a culture system
for high-throughput screening of primary xenograft tumor cells to test their drug
sensitivity. None of the molecular targeted therapeutics for the RAS pathway had any
significant activity but the oxidative stress pathway is a promising cellular target for
primary and recurrent ERMS. These data suggest that cell biology studies may be
combined with genomic analyses to identify druggable pathways for rhabdomyosarcoma.

CNVs in the ERMS and ARMS tumors in the discovery cohort. (B) Representative CIRCOS
plots of validated mutations and chromosomal lesions in two ERMS and two ARMS tumors
in the discovery cohort. Loss of heterozygosity (orange), gain (red), and losses (blue) are
shown. Intrachromosomal translocations (green lines) and interchromosomal translocations
(purple lines) are indicated. Sequence mutations in Refseq genes included silent single
nucleotide variants (SNVs, green), nonsense and missense SNVs (brown), splice-site and
UTR mutations (dark blue), and insertion/deletion mutations (red). (C) Representative plot
of sequence reads on chromosome 3 for the matched germline (green) and tumor (red)
sample. Distinct regions of copy number change are indicated by arrows. For clarity, some
of the gene names have been removed from the CIRCOS plots. In SJRHB003 and
SJRHB004, the labels for gene disrupting SVs have been removed. See also Tables S1,2 and
Figure S1.
