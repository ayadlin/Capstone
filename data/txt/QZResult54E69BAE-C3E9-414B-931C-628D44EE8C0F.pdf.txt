Abstract
Specific targeting of tumors by combined delivery of drugs and of imaging agents represents an attractive
strategy for treatment of cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether neural cell
adhesion molecule (NCAM)–targeted liposomes may enhance drug delivery and allow magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) in a severe combined immunodeficient mouse model of NCAM-positive Kaposi's sarcoma.
NCAM-binding peptide–coated liposomes loaded with both doxorubicin and a lipophilic gadolinium (Gd)
derivative were generated. NCAM-targeted liposomes induced an enhanced in vitro doxorubicin internalization within Kaposi's cells as detected by MRI with respect to untargeted polyethylene glycol liposomes.
Internalization resulted in enhanced apoptosis. In vivo weekly administration of NCAM-targeted liposomes
containing 5 mg/kg doxorubicin for 4 consecutive weeks induced a significant reduction of tumor mass and
vascularization and enhanced cell necrosis and apoptosis with respect to untargeted liposomes. These effects were associated with an enhanced concentration of doxorubicin within the tumor and a reduced systemic toxicity of doxorubicin. By electron microscopy, NCAM-targeted liposomes were detected mainly
within tumor cells whereas the untargeted liposomes were mainly accumulated in the extracellular space.
Gd-labeled liposomes allowed the MRI visualization of drug delivery in the tumor region. The intensity
of MRI signal was partially hampered by the “quenching” of the attainable relaxation enhancement on
endosomal entrapment of the Gd-labeled liposomes. In conclusion, targeting NCAM may be a suitable
strategy for specific drug delivery and imaging by liposomes in NCAM-expressing tumors. Moreover,
treatment with NCAM-targeted liposomes showed enhanced therapeutic effect and reduced toxicity with
respect to untargeted liposomes. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2180–90. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Targeting tumors or tumor endothelial cells (TEC) with
systems that combine delivery of drugs and imaging agents
represents one of the most important challenges for the
treatment of cancer. Lipid-based nanosized particles have
been proved to be suitable as carrier for the delivery of
several therapeutic agents (1–3). Due to its superb spatial

resolution, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) seems to be
the technique of choice for monitoring drug delivery process
and therapeutic output (4). Liposomes seem to be good candidates for carrying both therapeutic and contrast agents, as
the payload can be encapsulated in their internal aqueous
cavity and/or intercalated in the phospholipid bilayer, thus
allowing the transport of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic
compounds (5, 6). Clinical applications of liposomes in the
delivery of anticancer agents for the treatment of different
solid tumors are well established. A specific class of liposomes, named “long time circulating” polyethylene glycol
(PEG)–coated liposomes, are able to accumulate in solid tumors as a consequence of increased microvascular permeability and defective lymphatic drainage (7, 8). The extent
of passive extravasations is directly dependent on the prolonged residence time of liposomes in the blood stream (9,
10). The most common and widely used chemotherapeutic
agent encapsulated in liposomes is doxorubicin (11, 12).
The efficacy of doxorubicin incorporated in PEG-coated liposome is under investigation in several tumor models and
human clinical trials, such as ovarian, breast, brain, and

NCAM Tumor Targeting and Imaging

hepatocellular tumors (13–16). Moreover, doxorubicincontaining liposomes are currently used for treatment of
some solid tumors, such as Kaposi's sarcoma (17, 18).
The targeting of liposomes to tumor cells is a promising
strategy to reduce side effects and improve drug delivery to
tumors. To this purpose, liposomes have been functionalized
with specific ligands (peptides, monoclonal antibodies, and
small organic molecules) able to bind and to internalize receptors expressed on tumor vasculature or on tumor cells
(19–24).
We recently reported the expression of the embryonic
form of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) by Kaposi's
cells and TECs (25). NCAM is an adhesion molecule structurally belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily that mediates cell-to-cell interactions (26, 27). Moreover, NCAM is
expressed by several solid tumors and some leukemias (28).
By exploiting a high-affinity NCAM-binding peptide (C3d;
refs. 29, 30), we showed the possibility to target NCAM in vivo
in neo-formed vessels (31).
The aim of this work was to investigate the possibility to use
C3d-coated liposomes to enhance drug delivery and allow MRI
visualization in an in vivo model of Kaposi's sarcoma expressing NCAM. For this purpose, we generated C3d-coated PEG
liposomes (C3d lipo) loaded with both doxorubicin and a lipophilic gadolinium (Gd)–DOTA-monamide (DOTAMA) derivative. In vitro, we tested the incorporation of C3d lipo within
Kaposi's cells and TECs by MRI, the delivery of doxorubicin,
and its apoptotic effect. In vivo, we evaluated the therapeutic
effect of C3d lipo in a model of human Kaposi's sarcoma
in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice and the
concomitant drug delivery and MRI. The effect of C3d lipo
was compared with that of C3d-uncoated PEG liposomes
(PEG lipo) containing the same dose of doxorubicin and
Gd-DOTAMA derivative.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of doxorubicin-loaded liposomes. POPC
(1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine),
DSPE-PEG-PDP {1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-poly(ethyleneglycol)-2000-N-[3-(2-(pyridyldithio)
propionate] ammonium salt}, and DSPE-PEG {1,2-distearoylsn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene
glycol)-2000] ammonium salt} were purchased from Avanti
Polar Lipids. Cholesterol and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The lipophilic Gd-DOTAMA
(C18)2 was synthesized according to a previously reported
procedure (32). Liposomes were prepared by following the
thin lipid film hydration method (33). Doxorubicin (hydrochloric salt) incorporation in the internal liposome aqueous
phase was done by incubating 0.03 mg of drug per 1 mg of
phospholipids for 1 h at 55°C as described (34). The NCAM
mimetic C3d peptide (C3 peptide: ASKKPKRNIKA) and the
control peptide C3d-Ala, in which Lys6 and Arg7 residues
are substituted with alanines, were synthesized as previously
described (25). For conjugation to thiol-containing molecules, a cysteine residue was added at the COOH terminus

www.aacrjournals.org

of the tetrameric peptides before the lysine backbone (C3dCys and C3d-Ala-Cys). A scramble tetrameric peptide (S3d)
containing the COOH-terminal cysteine (S3d-Cys-S3d peptide: KAKSRINKAKP) was also synthesized as described in
Supplementary Data. The conjugation of the peptides to
the liposome was done as described (ref. 35; Supplementary
Data). The amount of Gd-DOTAMA(C18)2 incorporated in
the liposome was determined by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance T1 measurement at 20 MHz, 25°C (Stelar Spinmaster)
of the mineralized complex solution (in 6 mol/L HCl at 120°C
for 16 h). Doxorubicin encapsulation yield was ∼80% and
was measured after the peptide conjugation. The hydrated
mean diameter of liposomes and the ζ potential were determined using a Malvern dynamic light scattering spectrophotometer (Malvern Zetasizer 3000HS). All samples were
analyzed at 25°C in filtered (cutoff, 100 nm) HBS buffer (pH
7). The polydispersity index for all the liposomes prepared in
this work was smaller than 0.2. The liposomes were stored at
4°C under argon and used within 2 d from the preparation.
FITC-labeled liposomes have been prepared by adding to the
lipid mixture 0.1% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(carboxyfluorescein) (ammonium salt).
Cell lines. A primary culture of Kaposi's cells was obtained
from a cutaneous lesion of a patient bearing renal allograft
under immunosuppressive therapy and previously characterized (36). Kaposi's cells were maintained in culture in RPMI
with 10% FCS. TECs were obtained from renal clear cell carcinomas as previously described (37); TECs were maintained
in culture in EBM complete medium (Cambrex Bioscience)
supplemented with 10% FCS.
Uptake experiments and MRI analysis. Cells were incubated with the liposomes at different Gd concentrations for
3 h at 37°C in the complete medium. Cells were then washed,
detached with EDTA (1 mmol/L), washed, and transferred into glass capillaries placed in an agar phantom for MRI analysis. MRI was acquired on a Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer
(7 T) equipped with a Micro 2.5 microimaging using a standard T1-weighted multislice multiecho sequence (TR/TE/
NEX, 200:3.3:16; FOV, 1.2 cm; one slice = 1 mm; in-plane
resolution, 94 × 94 μm). T1 measurements of cells were done
by using a standard saturation recovery sequence.
Labeling of cell lines and liposomes for in vitro binding
assay. We labeled the cells with carboxyfluorescein diacetate
succinimidyl ester (Vybrant CFDA SE Cell Tracer Kit, Molecular Probe) and the liposomes with the PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker Kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's
instruction. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with
liposomes (C3d, C3d-Ala, or PEG) and, after washing, were
fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde containing 2% sucrose.
Confocal microscopy analysis was done using a Zeiss LSM
5 Pascal model confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss International). Hoechst 33258 dye (Sigma) was added for nuclear staining. Four different liposome preparations were tested.
Apoptosis assay. For in vitro experiments, we incubated
cells (Kaposi and TEC), cultured in a 24-well plate, for 1 h with
three different liposomes (C3d, C3d-Ala, or PEG) and with
doxorubicin alone as positive control. For each stimulus,
we used increasing doses of doxorubicin (100, 250, and

500 ng/mL). After 1 h, each sample was washed and medium
was replaced with fresh medium. Apoptosis was evaluated after 48 h by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (ApopTag Oncor, Millipore). Results are expressed as the mean (± SD) percentage of
apoptotic cells per field of four different experiments done in
triplicate.
Moreover, we assessed apoptosis by TUNEL assay on slices
of tumors recovered at the end of the in vivo experiment in
SCID mice; paraffin-embedded slices of tumors were deparaffinized, and TUNEL assays were done following the manufacturer's instruction. We counted the number of apoptotic
cells per field in 20 randomly chosen sections under ×200
magnification. We expressed the number of apoptotic cells
as mean ± SD.
In vivo therapeutic studies. All animal experiments were
done according to the guidelines for the care and use of research animals and were approved by the local ethics committee. Male mice were 6 to 8 wk of age and their weights
were ∼22 to 24 g. Kaposi's cells were s.c. implanted in the
flank of SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories, Inc.) within
growth factor Matrigel (Sigma; day 0); cells (2 × 106) were

resuspended in 150 μL of DMEM and added to 150 μL of
Matrigel. Ten days after the inoculation of tumor cells, mice
were randomly divided into three groups. The first group
(n = 12) received the functionalized liposomes (C3d lipo),
the second group (n = 12) was treated with PEG lipo, and
the third (n = 12), as control, was treated with equal volume
of PBS. Each mouse received in the tail vein a dose of liposomes corresponding to 5 mg/kg doxorubicin once per week
for 4 consecutive weeks. Mice were monitored two times
weekly for body weight and for evidence of tumor or doxorubicin treatment–associated morbidity. Four animals per each
group received FITC-labeled liposome in the last i.v. injection
for fluorescence staining of liposomes in tumors. Twenty-four
hours after the last liposome injection (36 d after the injection
of tumor cells) was considered the end of the experiment. Mice
were weighed and sacrificed, and the organs (kidney, liver,
tumor, brain, and spleen) were recovered for histology.
Doxorubicin alone (5 mg/kg) given with the same regimen
in six mice or liposomes coated with scramble peptide (see
Supplementary Data) were used as controls.
Histologic analysis. For histology, 5-μm-thick paraffin
sections of tumor, kidney, liver, brain, and spleen were

routinely stained with H&E (Merck). For the determination
of vessel number, sections were stained with Masson trichrome (Masson trichrome Golden, Bio-Optica) and the
number of vessels with blood cells inside was counted in
20 randomly chosen sections (×400).
Immunofluorescence. For confocal microscopy analysis,
sections from paraffin-embedded tumors treated with FITC
liposomes were stained with HLA class I polyclonal antibody
(BioLegend). Texas Red goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular
Probes) was used as secondary antibody. Hoechst 33258
dye (Sigma) was added for nuclear staining.
Electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy
was done on Karnovsky's fixed, osmium tetraoxide–postfixed
tissues and embedded in epoxy resin according to standard
procedures (38). Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl
acetate and lead citrate and were examined with a Jeol JEM
1010 electron microscope.
Quantification of doxorubicin in tumor. In eight animals
per group, the doxorubicin concentration was measured by
spectrofluorimetric analysis as described (ref. 39; see Supplementary Data). Tumors of untreated mice were used as negative control. The results were expressed as mean (± SD)
micrograms of doxorubicin per gram of tissue. Fluorescence
intensity was measured with a Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Excitation wavelength was positioned at 480 nm and emission wavelength was set at 595
nm. The release of doxorubicin in plasma samples of three
healthy individuals and in PBS was evaluated at 5 and 24 h.
Biodistribution and MRI. MRI was acquired at 7 T on a
Bruker Advance spectrometer as described above, using a T1weighted, fat-suppressed, multislice multiecho protocol (TR/
TE/NEX, 250:3.2:6; FOV, 3 cm; one slice = 1 mm). Fat suppression was done by applying a presaturation pulse (90° BW =
1,400 Hz) at the absorption frequency of fat (−1,100 Hz from
water). MRI images were acquired 1 d before every administration and 5 and 24 h after treatments. Tumor volumes were
estimated from MRI images two times per week. Before MRI
examination, animals were anesthetized by injecting tiletamine/zolazepam (Zoletil 100, Virbac, 20 mg/kg) and xylazine
(Rompun, Bayer SpA). The mean signal intensity values were
calculated in regions of interest drawn on the whole tumors,
liver, muscle, spleen, cortical regions of kidneys, and an abdominal vein. Treatment outcome was assessed by calculating the percentage of tumor growth inhibition in the group
treated with C3d lipo compared with the group that received
PEG lipo or vehicle alone (PBS).
Statistical methods. Data are presented as means ± SD.
Differences were determined by Student's t test or ANOVA
with the Newman-Keuls multicomparison tests when appropriate. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Preparation and characterization of liposomes. To
perform MRI-guided drug delivery, liposomes were loaded
with doxorubicin and the Gd-based MRI contrast agent
Gd-DOTAMA(C18) 2 (Fig. 1A). The millimolar relaxivity
(20 MHz, 25°C) of Gd-DOTAMA(C18)2 when incorporated

in the liposome formulation was 15.8 (mmol/L)−1 s−1. This
value is particularly high as a consequence of both the decrease of the molecular mobility after the insertion in the liposome membrane and the relatively fast water exchange
rate through the phospholipid bilayer (40). The NCAM targeting liposomes (C3d lipo) were generated using a C3d peptide
having a cysteine residue at the COOH terminus conjugated
with the PDP functions on the liposome surface. A control
liposome (C3d-Ala lipo) functionalized with a nonspecific
peptide (C3d-Ala), in which a lysine and an arginine involved
in the binding to the receptor of the C3d peptide were replaced by two alanines, was prepared with the same protocol.
A liposome functionalized with the C3d scrambled peptide
S3d was also prepared as control. The amount of doxorubicin
encapsulated in the liposomes remained almost unchanged
on conjugation with the peptides. The average liposome hydrodynamic diameters were unaffected on peptide conjugation, and they were 120 ± 20 nm for all investigated
formulations as detected by dynamic light scattering measurements. Liposome ζ potentials were −12.5 ± 0.6, +21 ± 2,
+9 ± 2, and +18 ± 2 mV for PEG lipo, C3d lipo, C3d-Ala lipo,
and S3d lipo, respectively.
As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, C3d lipo and PEG lipo
became stable on incubation at 37°C in PBS and in plasma
for 5 and 24 hours. The amount of Gd remained unchanged
for PEG and C3d lipo in both media (not shown).
In vitro liposome cell uptake and MRI. We previously
showed that Kaposi's cells and TECs express on their surface
the polysialylated embryonic form of NCAM (25). Liposomes
were tested on Kaposi's cells and TECs in vitro to evaluate the
amount of Gd and doxorubicin taken up by cells and the cytotoxic effect. The results obtained using C3d and C3d-Ala targeted liposomes were compared with those obtained using
nontargeted PEG lipo. The MRI acquired at 7 T on Kaposi's cell
and TEC pellets (Fig. 1B) showed the specific accumulation of
C3d lipo in tumor cells with respect to C3d-Ala lipo and PEG
lipo. Figure 1C shows that the intracellular concentration of
doxorubicin in Kaposi's cells and TECs incubated with C3d
lipo was significantly higher than that found in cells treated
with PEG lipo. A good correlation (r = 0.89 and 0.94 for Kaposi's
cells and TECs, respectively) between Gd relaxation enhancement and doxorubicin delivered to target cells after the incubation with C3d lipo was found (Fig. 1D). The Gd millimolar
relaxivity of internalized C3d lipo was 1.8 (mmol/L)−1 s−1 at
7 T, a value significantly lower than that measured at the same
magnetic field in a 1 mmol/L aqueous solution of C3d lipo
[r1p = 4.2 (mmol/L)−1 s−1]. This observation supports the view
that the liposomes are internalized through receptor-mediated
endocytosis. As previously shown (41, 42), the occurrence of a
low r1p value is a good indication that the Gd complexes are
confined in endosomal vesicles, thus resulting in a “quenching”
of the observed relaxivity.
In vitro apoptotic effect of C3d lipo internalization. By
confocal microscopy, C3d lipo labeled with the red fluorescent dye PKH26 were detected inside Kaposi's cells and TECs
after 1 hour of incubation, whereas only minimal internalization was seen using PEG lipo (Fig. 2A). When cells were
incubated with liposomes coated with the control C3d-Ala

doses of doxorubicin (100, 250, and 500 ng/mL) incorporated
within liposomes or used alone as control. A dose-dependent
increase in apoptosis was observed. C3d lipo induced a

loaded in C3d lipo or PEG lipo or with vehicle (PBS). As
shown in Fig. 3A, the size of tumors detected by MRI of mice
treated with C3d lipo was significantly lower than that of
mice treated with PEG lipo or PBS. The Kaposi's sarcomas
in SCID mice treated with PBS grew subcutaneously without
a significant mortality up to day 40 when mice were sacrificed. When treated with doxorubicin alone, all mice died be-

fore day 32 as a consequence of doxorubicin toxicity. In these
mice, a severe renal injury characterized by tubular necrosis
and atrophy, glomerulosclerosis (Fig. 3C), and proteinuria
(3,000 ± 500 mg/dL after 15 days) was observed. In contrast,
none of the mice treated with C3d lipo and only 30% of those
treated with PEG lipo died before the end of the observation
period. No significant proteinuria (0–50 mg/dL) or renal histopathologic lesions were observed in mice treated with C3d

reduced vascularization (Fig. 4A), and enhanced apoptosis as
seen by TUNEL assay and electron microscopy (Fig. 4B and
C). The reduction of vessels and the enhanced apoptosis
were significantly higher than in mice treated with PEG lipo
or PBS. By electron microscopy, tissue dissociation by edema
and characteristic fragmentation of apoptotic nuclei were
observed in tumors of mice treated with C3d lipo, but not
in tumors of mice treated with PEG lipo or PBS (Fig. 4C).

By confocal microscopy, FITC-labeled C3d lipo injected in
SCID mice were localized after 24 hours within the human
tumor cells, detected as HLA class I–positive cells. In contrast, only very limited incorporation was observed in mice
treated with PEG lipo (Fig. 5A). This observation is in agreement with the significantly higher amount of doxorubicin
extracted from tumors of mice treated with C3d lipo with
respect to those treated with PEG lipo (Fig. 5B).
The accumulation of C3d lipo in tumors was also assessed
by MRI. As seen in Fig. 5C, the localization of C3d lipo was
clearly detectable within the tumors that showed a reduced
size with respect to those treated with PEG lipo. However,

the signal enhancement was lower than that elicited on PEG
lipo administration (Fig. 5D). The electron microscopy of tumors showed that PEG lipo were mainly detectable outside
of the cells in the interstitial and perivascular areas, whereas
the C3d lipo were almost exclusively seen within the cytoplasm of tumor cells (Fig. 6).
Liposome biodistribution, measured by MRI, showed that
5 and 24 hours after injection, the C3d lipo blood content
was much lower than that of PEG lipo, with a concomitant
increase in liver and spleen uptake (see Supplementary
Data). To understand if the different biodistribution and efficacy of PEG and C3d liposomes were due to their different
surface charges, a control liposome functionalized with 0.5%
of a scrambled peptide of C3d was injected at the same doxorubicin dose (5 mg/kg) in a group of mice. The percentage
enhancement measured by MRI (see Supplementary
Fig. S2) shows that the amount of scrambled peptide liposome (S3d lipo) accumulated in the tumor is significantly
lower than that measured after the injection of C3d lipo.

Discussion
The results of the present study showed that the herein
developed liposome functionalized with an anti-NCAM peptide may be used for a combined delivery of a cytotoxic drug

and MRI in a model of human Kaposi's sarcoma in SCID
mice. Moreover, the targeted liposomes were found to be
more efficient for the delivery of drug for the regression
of the tumor and less toxic with respect to nontargeted
liposomes.
The Kaposi's sarcoma is an angiogenic tumor often associated with conditions of immune system impairment, such
as HIV1 infections or posttransplantation immunosuppressive therapy (43–45). We have recently found that Kaposi's
cells and tumor-derived endothelial cells express NCAM on
their surface. NCAM is a widely expressed molecule during
embryogenesis, which is downregulated in the course of differentiation to be reexpressed in some tumors and TECs (25).
By exploiting NCAM expression, we recently developed a
strategy to detect in vivo by MRI the neo-formed vessels using a NCAM peptide (C3d; ref. 31). In the present study, the
model of Kaposi's sarcoma implanted in SCID mice was chosen because treatment with liposome containing doxorubicin
is currently used as a therapeutic strategy for this tumor
(46, 47). Doxorubicin incorporation into liposomes seems
to reduce the systemic toxicity of the drug (48).
In the present study, we found that C3d-coated liposomes
loaded with both doxorubicin and Gd-DOTAMA(C18)2 were
internalized and induced apoptosis of Kaposi's cells and
TECs significantly more efficiently than did the uncoated

NCAM Tumor Targeting and Imaging

PEG liposomes. This indicated that the NCAM-C3d interaction allowed a specific internalization of C3d lipo whereas
PEG lipo mainly remained extracellular.
The incorporation of doxorubicin in PEG-coated liposomes alters the pharmacokinetics of the drug, resulting
in a smaller volume of distribution and slower plasma
clearance than free doxorubicin, thus allowing an extravasation at the site of enhanced permeability. In contrast, C3d
lipo were rapidly internalized within the Kaposi's sarcoma
cells bearing NCAM, with a reduced persistence in plasma.
This resulted in a more efficient reduction of tumor mass
and vascularization. These effects were related to an
enhanced in vivo intracellular accumulation of C3d lipo
within the tumors associated with an enhanced intratumor
concentration of doxorubicin with respect to PEG lipo.
Moreover, C3d lipo were found to be less toxic than free
doxorubicin and PEG lipo.
The specific delivery of C3d lipo to targeted Kaposi's cells
was confirmed by MRI both in vitro and in vivo. MRI showed
the reduced size of tumors in C3d lipo–treated mice and allowed detection of drug delivery within the tumors. However,
the intensity of MRI signal enhancement within the tumors
was lower than that obtained with PEG liposomes. This is
likely due to the internalization of paramagnetic liposomes
into cells that can limit the attainable relaxation enhancement as a consequence of the reduced water exchange across
the barriers among the different compartments. The efficiency of PEG lipo is more than two times higher than that of
C3d lipo because of its prevalent extracellular distribution.
In fact, by electron microscopy, PEG lipo were mainly detected outside of the cells in the interstitial and perivascular
areas whereas the C3d lipo were almost exclusively seen

within the cytoplasm of tumor cells. Furthermore, 24 hours
after the injection, a good amount of PEG lipo is still circulating in the blood stream, yielding an extra signal enhancement contribution in the tumor region.
In conclusion, NCAM-targeted liposomes specifically delivered doxorubicin and induced regression of Kaposi's sarcoma
in SCID mice, suggesting that targeting NCAM may be a therapeutic strategy for NCAM-positive tumors. Indeed, the therapeutic efficacy and the toxicity of doxorubicin were
improved when incorporated in the C3d liposomes. Finally,
the use of Gd-labeled liposomes allowed the concomitant
MRI visualization of the drug delivery in the tumor region.
