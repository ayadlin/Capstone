Monitoring Molecular Response in Chronic
Myeloid Leukemia
Jorge Cortes, MD; Alfonso Quintás-Cardama, MD; and Hagop M. Kantarjian, MD

Before the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, the evaluation of hematologic and cytogenetic responses
was sufficient to gauge treatment efficacy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. However, with more potent TKI
therapies, the majority of patients achieve complete cytogenetic response. Furthermore, deeper molecular responses
are now commonly achieved, necessitating a reliance on molecular monitoring to assess residual leukemic disease.
The prognostic significance between molecular responses and duration of complete cytogenetic response, progression-free survival, and event-free survival is described herein. A discussion of the concept of complete molecular
response is also provided, and the potential for imatinib treatment discontinuation is evaluated. The implications of
rising BCR-ABL1 transcript levels and caveats of molecular monitoring are also described. Cancer 2011;117:1113–22.

KEYWORDS: chronic myeloid leukemia, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, BCR-ABL, imatinib, molecular response.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disease resulting in expansion of hematopoietic cells

carrying the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 fusion, which encodes the constitutively active BCR-ABL1 protein tyrosine kinase.1
This fusion, known as the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome, is the result of a reciprocal translocation between the long
arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11) and can be detected by cytogenetic analysis.2 The resulting BCR-ABL1
tyrosine kinase is upstream of numerous signaling pathways and necessary for initiation of leukemogenesis.2-4 Imatinib
(Gleevec/Glivec; formerly STI571, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ), nilotinib (Tasigna; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation), and dasatinib (Sprycel; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) are BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) designed to inhibit BCR-ABL1 activity and have dramatically improved outcomes for patients with
CML.5-7 A recent 8-year follow-up of patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML in chronic phase)
treated with imatinib in the phase 3 IRIS (International Randomized Study of Interferon and STI571) trial reported a
cumulative rate of complete cytogenetic response of 83% and an estimated overall survival (OS) of 93% when only CMLrelated deaths were considered.8 This review describes the approaches to measuring responses in light of the success of
TKI therapy in the treatment of CML and the prognostic significance of those responses.
Definitions and Approaches to Measuring Response in CML
The goals of CML treatment are the return of blood counts to normal values, reduction and elimination of the Ph1
chromosome, and reduction and elimination of BCR-ABL1 gene expression. Progress toward these goals can be
determined by the measurement of hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses, respectively. Before the advent of
TKI therapy, the evaluation of hematologic and cytogenetic responses was sufficient to gauge treatment efficacy. However,
with more potent TKI therapies, deeper responses are now commonly achieved, necessitating more sensitive methods of
disease detection.
Hematologic responses

A complete hematologic response (CHR) is achieved when laboratory values return to normal levels, with a white
blood cell count <10,000/mm3, a platelet count <450,000/mm3, the presence of <5% myelocytes plus metamyelocytes,
the presence of <5% basophils, the absence of blasts and promyelocytes in peripheral blood, and the absence of

recommendations state that achievement of CHR within
3 months from the start of therapy is an optimal
response.10 Nearly all patients with CML in chronic phase
achieve a CHR with TKI therapy.
Cytogenetic responses

Cytogenetic analysis remains the gold standard for
response to treatment monitoring in CML.10 Conventional cytogenetics requires a bone marrow sample and
evaluation of >20 metaphases for the Ph1þ chromosome. Categories of cytogenetic response include minimal
cytogenetic response, with 36% to 95% Ph1þ metaphases; partial cytogenetic response, with 1% to 35%
Ph1þ metaphases; major cytogenetic response, with 0%
to 35% Ph1þ metaphases; and complete cytogenetic
response, with 0% Ph1þ metaphases. Although cytogenetic studies are associated with a wide confidence interval
because of the limited number of metaphases evaluated,
the association between cytogenetic response and positive
outcomes has been well established.11,12
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is an alternative method for assessing cytogenetic response in which
approximately 200 interphase cells are analyzed from a
peripheral blood sample. Although newer FISH techniques use 3 to 4 probes (double-fusion FISH) and reduce
the number of false-positive results (sensitivity is 1%5%), achievement of complete cytogenetic response
cannot always be confirmed by FISH; hence, clinicians
should be cautious in declaring treatment failure based on
low-level FISH positivity.
Molecular responses

The majority (83%) of patients with CML treated
with TKI therapy achieve a complete cytogenetic response
(elimination of the Ph1 chromosome in bone marrow
metaphases), and therefore more sensitive measurements
are necessary to detect minimal residual disease.13 Molecular monitoring accomplishes this by detecting the presence of BCR-ABL1 mRNA using real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). Molecular monitoring is capable of detecting low levels of disease and is >3
logs more sensitive than conventional cytogenetics.14 In
addition, the analysis can be performed on peripheral
blood samples, making it more convenient than bone
marrow sampling.15 Molecular responses are quantified
by measuring the reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcripts
relative to a standardized baseline.9 The International
Standardization process has led to the development of a

1114

conversion factor that enables individual laboratories to
express BCR-ABL1 transcript levels on an agreed-upon
international scale, thus allowing comparison of molecular response between laboratories.16,17 In the IRIS trial,
patients in the imatinib group who had a reduction in the
level of BCR-ABL1 transcripts of >3 logs compared with
the standardized baseline had a negligible risk of disease
progression over the subsequent 12 months.18 As a result,
a major molecular response was defined as a 3-log reduction or a BCR-ABL1 (international scale) ¼ 0.1%.18 A
good correlation exists between bone marrow cytogenetics
and transcript levels in peripheral blood, with a BCRABL1 (international scale) 10% equivalent to a major
cytogenetic response and a BCR-ABL1 (international
scale) 1% equivalent to a complete cytogenetic
response. However, unlike cytogenetics, molecular analysis does not provide information about bone marrow morphology or additional chromosomal abnormalities.19
Prognostic Significance of
Molecular Responses
There is much evidence that the degree of cytogenetic
response at certain time points is well correlated with
prognosis. Patients who achieve a complete cytogenetic
response have been shown to have low rates of progression
to accelerated phase/blast crisis (AP/BC) and excellent
rates of OS.10,20 The degree of molecular response at certain time points has also been associated with reduced risk
of cytogenetic relapse, improved duration of complete
cytogenetic response, progression-free survival (PFS), and
event-free-survival (EFS).
Major molecular response is associated with
duration of complete cytogenetic response

Several studies have demonstrated that achievement
of a major molecular response is associated with improved
durations of complete cytogenetic response compared
with patients who did not achieve the same depth of
molecular response (Table 1). For example, in a study of
29 patients with complete cytogenetic response followed
for a median of 13 months, none of the 16 patients with
BCR-ABL1 (international scale) 0.1% lost complete
cytogenetic response, whereas 6 (46%) of 13 patients with
BCR-ABL1 (international scale) 0.1% lost a complete
cytogenetic response (P ¼ .004).21 In another report on
280 patients with CML in chronic phase who achieved a
complete cytogenetic response on imatinib treatment,
only 9 (5%) of 166 evaluable patients who also achieved a
major molecular response lost complete cytogenetic

did not achieve a major molecular response over a median
follow-up period of 31 months.22 Likewise, in 97 patients
with CML serially treated with imatinib 400 mg/d, those
with a major molecular response at 12 months were less
likely to lose complete cytogenetic response than patients
who did not achieve major molecular response by that
time point (Fig. 1).23 Marin et al have reported similar
findings in a study of 224 patients in which the probability of losing complete cytogenetic response by 60 months
was 2.6% versus 23.6% for patients who achieved a major
molecular response by 12 months compared with patients
who did not achieve a major molecular response, respectively.24 At 18 months, the probability of losing complete
cytogenetic response was 0% versus 24.6% for patients
with major molecular response and without major
molecular response, respectively. In addition, Press et al
described 90 patients with complete cytogenetic response
followed for a median of 49 months in which only 15%
(12 of 79 patients) with BCR-ABL1 (international scale)
0.1% lost complete cytogenetic response compared
with 57% (8 of 14 patients) with BCR-ABL1 (international scale) >0.1%.25
Impact of molecular responses
on PFS, EFS, and OS

The impact of molecular response rates on PFS and
EFS has also been evaluated. Among patients with complete cytogenetic response at 12 months in the IRIS trial,
there was a statistically significant difference in PFS rates
between patients with and without major molecular
response at 12 months (100% vs 95%, P ¼ .007).18 However, in a more recent update of the molecular data from
the IRIS trial, with longer follow-up, there was no difference between achievement of a major molecular response

none of the patients who achieved complete cytogenetic
response and major molecular response at 12 months on
imatinib progressed to AP or BC.8 The degree of molecular response was also found to correlate with the risk of
progression in a single-institution study of 85 patients
treated with imatinib (400 mg/d in chronic phase patients
[n ¼ 72] and 600 mg/d in AP patients [n ¼ 13]).27
Results demonstrated that compared with patients with a
3-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 levels, patients with 2to <3-log reductions in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels were
at a higher risk for progression (hazard ratio, 3.8; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.92-16; P ¼ .049), as were
patients with a <2-log reduction (hazard ratio, 10; 95%
CI, 3.8-28; P < .001) (Fig. 2).
Other studies, however, have shown that rates of OS
and PFS appear independent of molecular response. In an
analysis conducted at The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center, 276 patients were analyzed, and
responses were coded according to best response and
response at specific treatment intervals.13 Achievement of
molecular response (major molecular response and
<major molecular response) was not associated with
improved OS in patients who achieved a complete cytogenetic response (Fig. 3). Although there was a trend suggesting that higher rates of PFS correlated with better
molecular responses, the difference was not clinically relevant (Fig. 3). In a similar single-institution analysis, investigators at the Hammersmith Hospital found no
significant difference in PFS or OS rates in patients
achieving complete cytogenetic response at 12 months

(n ¼ 121) or at 18 months (n ¼ 106) by whether they had
also achieved a major molecular response at those time
points (n ¼ 30 at 12 months; n ¼ 38 at 18 months).24,28
At 12 months, OS and PFS were 96% and 94% versus
93% and 85% for patients with major molecular response
and without major molecular response, respectively (P ¼
.8, P ¼ .3).24 At 18 months, OS and PFS were 96% and
95% versus 95% and 88% for patients with major molecular response and without major molecular response,
respectively (P ¼ 1, P ¼ .4).24 One possible explanation
for the lack of association between molecular response
and long-term outcomes in these studies is that loss of
complete cytogenetic response may (and should) trigger a
change in therapy. This early intervention can successfully
prevent progression to AP/BC in most patients, thus
masking the adverse consequences of lack of a major
molecular response. In fact, the European LeukemiaNet
recommendations suggest that loss of complete cytogenetic response is a criterion for imatinib failure and
support change of therapy in this situation.10
Influence of time to molecular response

The correlation between outcomes and the time to
achieve molecular response has been investigated. These
studies suggest that the degree of molecular response at
early time points predicts later achievement of major molecular response and improved rates of PFS and EFS. For
example, in an analysis of 55 patients treated with imatinib 400 mg/d who had peripheral blood collected at >1
time points, patients with a >2-log reduction in BCRABL1 transcripts at 3 months had significantly better rates
of major molecular response at 24 months compared with
patients who had a 2-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcripts at 3 months (100% vs 54%, P < .001) (Fig. 4).29
Muller et al have also observed that patients with BCRABL1 (international scale) >10% at the 6-month landmark had a statistically significantly higher probability of
progression and events by 72 months.30 The 5-year PFS
rate was 93% versus 72% (P ¼ .0023), and the 5-year
EFS rate was 88% versus 77% (P ¼ .012) in patients with
BCR-ABL1 (international scale) <10% and 10%,
respectively (Fig. 5). Early molecular responses at 1 and 3
months have also been associated with higher rates of
PFS.31 A decrease in BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratio of 50% at
4 weeks or 10% at 3 months of therapy was associated
with a higher probability of PFS (Fig. 6). An alternative
analysis by M. D. Anderson Cancer Center investigators
focused on the long-term outcomes of patients not achieving complete cytogenetic response or major molecular

response at specific time points, in an attempt to test the
importance of the timing of cytogenetic and molecular
responses during imatinib therapy.32 For patients not in
complete cytogenetic response, the probability of achieving a complete cytogenetic response or major molecular
response with continued imatinib therapy markedly
diminished, and the risk of progression increased at 3, 6,
and 12 months during the first year of imatinib therapy.
Patients exhibiting BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratios >1% to
10% after 3 months of treatment had a 92% probability

event on therapy was 3-fold higher than that of patients
with BCR-ABL1/ABL1 1%, which was quite similar to
that of patients with transcript levels >10%. These results

underscore the importance of attaining complete cytogenetic response and possibly major molecular response at
early time points during imatinib therapy (Table 2).
Significance of rising BCR-ABL1 transcript levels

Despite the importance of molecular monitoring in
predicting long-term outcomes and evaluating treatment
success, minor fluctuations in patients’ BCR-ABL1 transcript levels should not be overinterpreted. For example,
an evaluation of 116 patients who achieved durable complete cytogenetic response (>18 months) with increases in
BCR-ABL1 transcript levels verified by 2 consecutive
measurements has been conducted.33 Progression was
observed in 11 (9.5%) of 116 patients (Table 3). Ten of
these were among 44 patients who lost or never achieved a
major molecular response and experienced a >1-log

increase in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels. The majority of
patients who had achieved complete cytogenetic response
retained the same degree of response despite increasing
transcript levels. Therefore, minor fluctuations in BCRABL1 should not necessarily provoke a treatment change.
However, patients who lose major molecular response or
never achieved major molecular response and have a significant increase in transcripts should be closely monitored. The magnitude of the increase that should be
considered significant varies in different reports, from 2fold to 1-log. Some of this difference depends on the vari-

complete molecular response correlates with improved
long-term EFS, PFS, or OS.
Several studies have examined the potential of discontinuing imatinib therapy in patients with a complete
molecular response.37-40 The STIM (Stop Imatinib) study
evaluated the impact of imatinib discontinuation in
patients with sustained complete molecular response for at
least 2 years.40 After 12 months of follow-up, molecular
relapse (loss of complete molecular response) occurred in
40 (58%) of 69 patients. The relapse rate was slightly lower
among patients previously treated with interferon compared with those who were not (53% vs 66%, P was not
significant) and was more common among women than
men (70% vs 42% relapse rate, P ¼ .02). Relapse rates correlated with Sokal risk score: low, 45%; intermediate, 64%;
high, 86%; and unknown, 78%. All patients reachieved
complete molecular response after reinitiation of imatinib
therapy. As a result of the high relapse rate, discontinuation
of TKI therapy in responding patients is not currently recommended outside a clinical study setting.

TKIs nilotinib and dasatinib in the frontline setting could
increase the number of patients achieving this level of
response even more.34-36 However, without elimination
of the leukemic stem cell population, a cure is not feasible,
and currently there is little evidence that achievement of a

Conclusions
Treatment advances for patients with CML have resulted
in excellent long-term outcomes. TKI therapy with imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib results in high response rates,
many of which can only be measured at a molecular level.
As a result, there is an increasing reliance on molecular
monitoring as a more sensitive measure to assess treatment
efficacy and monitor response. Although it has been established that patients who achieve a complete cytogenetic
response also have excellent outcomes, data indicate that
achieving high levels of molecular response illustrates
treatment efficacy and should be a goal of therapy. The
prognostic significance of molecular responses at early
time points also provides valuable information and suggests more careful monitoring of patients with suboptimal
molecular responses. In patients with major molecular

response (BCR-ABL1 [international scale] 0.1%),
molecular monitoring in peripheral blood may be used in
place of cytogenetic analysis to monitor response, thus forgoing the need for bone marrow sampling. However, it must
be emphasized that molecular monitoring does not provide
information concerning bone marrow morphology or the
presence of additional chromosomal abnormalities in Ph1þ
metaphases. Therefore, occasional cytogenetic analysis is still
recommended. One must also keep in mind that low assay
sensitivity and sample quality could result in false-negative
results, and that variations in results of up to 0.5 log can
occur because of differences in assay technique and sample
quality. Because of these caveats, changes in treatment should
not be based on a single molecular assessment. Instead, fluctuations in transcripts should be monitored and confirmed
with follow-up testing and, if necessary, cytogenetic or mutation analysis should be used in conjunction with molecular
monitoring when transcript levels rise significantly (5-fold)
or if the patient is in danger of losing a major molecular
response. Various studies also suggest that although deep molecular response should be a goal for all patients and is an indication of treatment success, patients who achieve a
complete cytogenetic response have been shown to have
almost as good long-term outcomes as patients with a major
molecular response, thus making complete cytogenetic
response a valid surrogate of long-term survival and the minimal goal to be achieved during TKI therapy.
