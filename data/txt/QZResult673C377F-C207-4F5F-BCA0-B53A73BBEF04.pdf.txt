BACKGROUND: Anemia is a frequent side effect of imatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
Erythropoietic-stimulating agents have been used for treatment of imatinib-induced anemia. There are no data on
long-term safety of erythropoietic-stimulating agents in CML patients. METHODS: The records of chronic phase CML
patients who received treatment with imatinib were reviewed for use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents and occurrence of thrombotic events. Data on cytogenetic response and survival were analyzed by use of erythropoietic-stimulating agent. RESULTS: A total of 608 patients were included, and 217 patients received erythropoietic-stimulating
agents. There were 30 thrombotic episodes. Patients who received erythropoietic-stimulating agents had a higher
rate of thrombosis (8.5% vs 2.6%, P ¼ .0025). There was no difference in cytogenetic response rate and survival by
use of erythropoietic-stimulating agent. Development of grade 3-4 anemia occurred in 62 (10%) patients and was
associated with significantly worse response and survival in patients in late chronic phase. By multivariate analysis,
use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents was not a risk factor for event-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of
chronic phase CML patients, use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents did not impact survival or cytogenetic response
rate, but was associated with a higher thrombosis rate. Severe anemia is associated with worse survival and response.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib (Gleevec; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) is standard therapy for patients

with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).1 Therapy with imatinib is generally well tolerated, and the most common side
effects include nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, muscle cramps, rashes, fluid retention, liver enzymes abnormalities, and myelosuppression.2,3 Myelosuppression is the most common grade 3-4 toxicity, occurring in 35% to 45% of patients treated
with imatinib after interferon (IFN)-a failure and in 15% of patients with previously untreated CML.3-5 Anemia has been
reported in 45% to 68% of patients in chronic phase treated with imatinib, and is grade 3-4 in 7% of patients after IFN-a
failure and in 3% to 7% of those receiving imatinib as initial CML therapy.3-5 The development of myelosuppression,
including anemia, in patients with CML has been associated with an inferior outcome.2,5,6
The use of growth factors such as erythropoietic-stimulating agents (recombinant human erythropoietin [EPO] or darbepoietin-a) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor during therapy with TKI in CML can improve cytopenias and
decrease the frequency of interruptions and dose reductions.6,7 Among patients with chronic phase CML receiving therapy
with imatinib, erythropoietic-stimulating agents improved hemoglobin (Hb) levels by at least 2 g/dL in 68% of patients.6
Recently, concerns have been raised regarding the safety of erythropoietic-stimulating agents in patients with can8
cer. A meta-analysis showed that the use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents for prophylaxis or treatment of anemia in
patients with cancer increases mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17) and decreases overall survival (OS) (HR, 1.06).9

Erythropoietic-Stimulating Agents in CML/Santos et al

Another meta-analysis reported that erythropoietic-stimulating agents increase the risk for venous thromboembolic events (relative risk, 1.57) and decrease survival
(HR, 1.10) in patients with cancer.10 In addition, a
randomized trial showed that use of darbepoietin-a was
associated with worse survival in patients with cancerrelated anemia not receiving chemotherapy.11 Erythropoietic-stimulating agents shortened time to tumor progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer
receiving radiation therapy when it was administered to
target an Hb of >12 g/dL.12 Similarly, use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents decreased OS in patients with
metastatic breast cancer and nonsmall cell lung cancer.13,14 This evidence led to a revision in the US Food
and Drug Administration product labels for erythropoietic-stimulating agents, issuing a black box warning
indicating the possibility of shortened survival and cancer
progression in cancer patients treated with erythropoieticstimulating agents when targeting a Hb level of 10 to
12 g/dL.8
For patients with CML and imatinib-induced
anemia, there are few treatment options. The American
Society of Hematology/American Society of Clinical
Oncology guidelines on the use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents in patients with cancer recommends that for
patients with chemotherapy-associated anemia and lowrisk myelodysplastic syndrome, erythropoietic-stimulating agents should be initiated as Hb approaches or falls
below 10 g/dL to increase Hb and decrease transfusions.8
The dose should be decreased by 25% to 40% when Hb
reaches the level needed to avoid transfusion or if the rate
of Hb increase is >1 g/dL in 2 weeks.8 However, erythropoietic-stimulating agent are frequently used in patients
with CML to treat anemia associated with TKI therapy,
but the long-term safety of their use in this setting is
unknown.6 We thus conducted this analysis to investigate
the prognostic impact of erythropoietic-stimulating agent
use among patients with CML in chronic phase treated
with imatinib and to define the incidence of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or thromboembolic episodes in this
patient population.

Cancer Center from December 1999 to December 2005.
Patients with clonal evolution but no other criteria for
accelerated phase (AP) were also included in this analysis.
Patients were enrolled in studies involving CML after
IFN-a failure (protocols DM99-367, DM00-139, and
ID01-292) or newly diagnosed CML (protocols ID02534, ID01-151, ID01-015, and DM00-163). In 3 studies
(ID01-292, ID02-534, and ID01-151), patients received
high-dose imatinib (800 mg daily). In the remaining protocols, patients received standard-dose imatinib (400 mg
daily). Details about entry criteria, treatment dose
schedules and adjustments, pretreatment, and follow-up
evaluations have been detailed in previous reports.3,4,15-19
Studies were approved by the institutional review board
and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent
before study entry.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patient Monitoring and Response Criteria
Patients were followed with complete blood counts
(CBCs) weekly during the first 4 weeks of therapy with
imatinib and then every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who developed myelosuppression had a CBC performed every 1 to
2 weeks. The CML response criteria were as previously

Use of Erythropoietin in Treatment of Anemia
Anemia was graded according to the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria version 3.0 as
grade 1 (<lower limit of normal [LLN]-10 g/dL), grade 2
(<10-8.0 g/dL), grade 3 (<8.0-6.5 g/dL), and grade 4
(<6.5 g/dL). The LLN was 12 g/dL. Use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents was defined as therapy with either EPO or darbepoetin-a concomitant with imatinib
therapy, regardless of the cause of the anemia. Indication
for use and duration of therapy with erythropoietic-stimulating agents was determined by the treating physician.
Patients received different doses and schedules of erythropoietic-stimulating agents at the discretion of the treating
physician. The most common starting doses were for
EPO 40,000 U once a week, and for darbepoetin-a 200
to 400 lg every 2 weeks. Patients who had signs suggestive
of iron deficiency, as determined by clinical history, red
blood cell indexes measurements, serum iron, serum total
iron binding capacity, and/or serum ferritin concentrations, received oral iron supplementation and were evaluated for possible causes of blood loss before starting on
erythropoietic-stimulating agents. Erythropoietin levels
were not routinely measured before starting therapy with
erythropoietic-stimulating agents.

published.1 Briefly, a complete hematologic response
(CHR) required normalization, for at least 4 weeks, of the
bone marrow (BM; <5% blasts) and peripheral blood
with a white blood cell (WBC) count <10  109/L, without blasts, promyelocytes, or myelocytes, basophils <2%,
a platelet count <450  109/L, and disappearance of all
signs and symptoms of CML. Cytogenetic response was
defined by the percentage of Philadelphia chromosome
positive (Ph1þ) metaphases in at least 20 metaphases
from a BM aspirate (fluorescent in situ hybridization if
insufficient metaphases) as follows: complete cytogenetic
response, 0% Ph1þ metaphases; partial cytogenetic
response (partial cytogenetic response)-1%-35% Ph1þ
metaphases; minor cytogenetic response, 36% to 65%
Ph1þ metaphases; minimal cytogenetic response, 66% to
95% Ph1þ metaphases; no response, 96% to 100%
Ph1þ metaphases. Major cytogenetic response was
defined as complete cytogenetic response plus partial
cytogenetic response (<36% Ph1þ metaphases).
Definition of Event-Free Survival
and Overall Survival
Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the time from
start of treatment to the occurrence of an event. An event
was defined as death from any cause, transformation to
AP or blast phase, loss of major cytogenetic response, and
loss of CHR.4 OS was defined from the time treatment
was started until death from any cause; patients alive at
last follow-up were censored.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical and continuous variables between groups
were compared using the chi-square/Fisher exact test and
Mann-Whitney U test, respectively.20 Survival curves and
probabilities were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method
and compared by the log-rank test.21,22 A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between
clinical features and development of thrombosis. Variables included in the multivariate logistic regression model
were age, sex, use of high-dose imatinib, stage (late
chronic phase vs untreated), percentage of Ph1þ cells,
WBC, Hb, platelet count, percentage of BM blasts, prior
use of IFN-a (yes vs no), Sokal risk (high vs other), duration of disease, and use of erythropoietic-stimulating
agents (yes vs no). Variables were eliminated by backward
selection, with a P value cutoff of.05. Clinical and biological characteristics were analyzed for their association with
EFS using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.23 Variables significant in the univariate analysis were

984

added to the multivariate model, and nonsignificant variables were eliminated by backward selection with a P value
cutoff of.05. The categorical variable use of erythropoietic-stimulating agent was added to the model because
it was the variable of interest. All P values were 2-sided.
Calculations were done in Statistica, version 6.1 (StatSoft,
Tulsa, Okla) and SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Results of
Erythropoietic-Stimulating Agent Therapy
A total of 608 patients were analyzed. Three-hundred
seven (50%) were in early chronic phase (previously
untreated), and 301 (50%) were in late chronic phase
(post-IFN-a failure). Forty-one (7%) patients had clonal
evolution and were analyzed together with early chronic
phase or late chronic phase depending on prior treatment
history. High-dose imatinib (800 mg) was used in 249
(41%) patients, whereas the remaining patients received
standard-dose imatinib (400 mg). Of those 249 patients,
94 with untreated CML participated in a randomized
study of high-dose imatinib alone versus high-dose imatinib combined with IFN-a and sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]),
with 45 (7%) patients being randomized to the combination arm.19 Anemia (any degree) was detected during
therapy with imatinib in 502 (83%) patients, being grade
3-4 in 62 (10%) patients. Patients treated with high-dose
imatinib had a higher incidence of anemia (any grade)
than those treated with standard dose (90% vs 78%; P ¼
.0002), but no difference in the incidence of grade 3-4
anemia (11% vs 9%; P ¼ .47). The addition of IFN-a
and GM-CSF to high-dose imatinib did not affect the
incidence of anemia compared with high-dose imatinib
alone (91% vs 82%, P ¼ .11) or grade 3-4 anemia (11%
vs 10%, P ¼ .83).
Overall, 217 (36%) patients received therapy with
erythropoietic-stimulating agents at some point during
treatment with imatinib. Forty (7%) patients were already
receiving erythropoietic-stimulating agents before starting
therapy with imatinib and continued using erythropoietic-stimulating agents while on imatinib. Among the
remaining 177 patients, median time between start of
imatinib therapy and start of an erythropoietic-stimulating agent was 9 months (range, 1-89 months). The characteristics of patients who received erythropoieticstimulating agents versus those who did not are shown in

agents were older (57 vs 49 years, P < .0001), had lower
Hb at the start of therapy with imatinib (11.7 vs 12.9, P
< .0001), and had a higher prevalence of intermediate
and high risk by Sokal score (P < .0001). Patients treated
with erythropoietic-stimulating agents received therapy
with variable, intermittent doses of EPO and/or
darbepoetin-a during a median time of 15 months (range,
1-113 months). The median nadir Hb among patients
treated with erythropoietic-stimulating agents was 9.2 g/
dL (45 [20%] with grade 3-4 anemia) and was 11.1 g/dL
(17 [4%] with grade 3-4 anemia) in those not treated
with erythropoietic-stimulating agents (P < .0001). The
observed best increase in Hb with erythropoietic-stimulating agent therapy was >3 g/dL in 119 (55%), 2 to 3 g/dL
in 54 (25%), 1 to <2 g/dL in 33 (15%), and <1 g/dL in
11 (5%) patients. The median Hb level achieved with
erythropoietic-stimulating agents was 12.9 g/dL (range,
8.9-16.1 g/dL).
Dose Reductions and ErythropoieticStimulating Agent Use
Data on imatinib dose reduction were available for 605
patients. There was a higher prevalence of dose reductions

versus those who did not (53% vs 38%; P ¼ .0002). We
did a subanalysis on only those patients who started with
standard-dose imatinib and found similar results (47% vs
25%, P < .00001). However, these results are confounded by the finding that patients who did not develop
anemia were less likely to require dose reductions and to
have an indication for use of erythropoietic-stimulating
agents. Thus, we did an analysis focusing only on 251
patients who developed grade 2 anemia and would have
a theoretical indication for erythropoietic-stimulating
agent use. In this population of patients, there was no difference in the occurrence of dose reductions by use of
erythropoietic-stimulating agents (56% vs 52%, P ¼ .51).
Restricting the analysis to those patients who started therapy with standard-dose imatinib also did not demonstrate
a statistically significant difference in the rate of dose
reductions (53% vs 39%, P ¼ .12).
Thrombotic Episodes and Relationship to
Erythropoietic-Stimulating Agent Use
Overall, 27 (4.4%) patients developed 30 thrombotic episodes (3 patients had 2 episodes) after starting therapy
with imatinib (Table 2). There were 11 cardiovascular
events, 8 cerebrovascular events, and 11 thromboembolic
events. Patients had other risk factors for thrombotic

platelet counts, higher percentage of peripheral blood
blasts, higher percentage of BM blasts, older age, development of grade 3-4 anemia, and high-risk Sokal score. By
multivariate analysis (Table 5), late chronic phase (vs early
chronic phase), higher percentage of Ph1þ cells in BM,
higher percentage of BM blasts, high-risk Sokal score, and
development of grade 3-4 anemia were associated with
worse EFS. Use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents was
not associated with worse EFS in the multivariate model.

DISCUSSION
The use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents in patients
with cancer has become a matter of discussion in the past
few years, with reports indicating that erythropoieticstimulating agents may increase the mortality in patients
with cancer, particularly when the target Hb is >12 g/
dL.8-11 Most of these studies analyzed a heterogeneous
group of patients, including both patients with solid
tumors and patients with hematological malignancies,
and in the majority of reports patients were being treated
with conventional chemotherapeutic agents.12-14 Thus, it
is important to discern the impact of erythropoietic-stimulating agents in response and survival in different subtypes of cancer and in patients receiving treatment with
targeted therapy agents such as TKIs.
We retrospectively analyzed the demographics of
use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents in patients with
CML treated with imatinib and its impact in response
and survival. As expected, patients who used erythropoietic-stimulating agents had a lower median Hb at the
start of TKI therapy. Patients who received erythropoietic-stimulating agents also tended to be older, probably a reflection of decreased tolerance to lower Hb levels.
Erythropoietic-stimulating agents were highly effective
for treatment of anemia in CML. A significant (>2 g/dL)
increase in Hb levels was seen in 80% of treated patients.
Increases in Hb levels might in theory improve the dose
intensity of imatinib and the response rate. However, we
did not observe that patients who developed anemia and
were subsequently treated with erythropoietic-stimulating
agents had a lower rate of dose reductions. Interestingly,
there was a trend for a higher complete cytogenetic
response rate in patients receiving imatinib as initial therapy who received erythropoietic-stimulating agents.
A previously published meta-analysis linked the use
of erythropoietic-stimulating agents with venous thromboembolic events in patients with cancer.10 Most studies
analyzed were either focused solely on 1 specific type of

solid tumor or excluded myeloid malignancies. CML
belongs to the group of myeloproliferative neoplasms, a
group of myeloid malignancies that has been known to be
associated with thrombotic phenomena.24 We analyzed
the prevalence of thrombotic events in this population of
patients with CML and its relation with use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents. There was a higher prevalence
of thrombotic events in patients who were receiving or
had received erythropoietic-stimulating agents, and use of
erythropoietic-stimulating agents was associated with
thrombosis in a multivariate logistic regression analysis.
These events frequently occurred in patients who had
other risk factors for thrombotic episodes, such as a prior
history of coronary artery disease, and frequently when
hemoglobin had increased to 11 g/dL or higher. Thus,
firm conclusions regarding the role of erythropoieticstimulating agents in such thrombotic events cannot be
reached. However, clinicians should be cautious with the
use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents in CML patients
who present with other risk factors for thrombotic events,
with particular caution taken not to continue erythropoietic-stimulating agents at Hb levels that approximate
12 g/dL.
In our patient population, use of erythropoieticstimulating agents did not lead to a decrease in EFS or
OS. In a multivariate analysis for EFS, the use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents was not a significant factor.
Thus, although concerns may still be raised by the possible
association between erythropoietic-stimulating agents and
thrombotic events, we could not conclude that erythropoietic-stimulating agents shorten the survival of CML
patients being treated with imatinib. This observation
should be taken with caution, considering that this was
a retrospective analysis of the data and thus could be
affected by latent variables not considered in this analysis.
Still, there is no obvious adverse effect of the use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents on outcome. Considering
the prevalence of anemia in patients treated with TKIs,
the effect that anemia has on the quality of life of patients,
the chronicity of the therapy, and the lack of alternative
options to manage anemia associated with TKI use, the
use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents should be more
carefully studied to confirm these observations.
The development of severe (grade 3-4) anemia was
associated with worse response rates and survival, particularly in patients with late chronic phase CML (post-IFN
failure). This is in accordance with previously published
reports that demonstrated that the development of anemia
in CML patients being treated with imatinib is associated

with worse response and survival.5,6,25 This could be a
reflection of increased disease burden, as the TKI would
induce more profound myelosuppression in patients who
had a greater burden of Ph1þ hematopoiesis and insufficient Ph1 hematopoietic cells for a rapid recovery of the
BM. Alternatively, it could also be a consequence of dose
reductions and treatment interruptions, which could lead
to a decrease in the dose intensity and compromise outcomes.26,27 Imatinib also inhibits other tyrosine kinases
that are important for hematopoiesis, such as c-Kit,28 and
increased plasma levels of imatinib have been associated
with development of anemia in CML patients.29
The mechanism by which erythropoietic-stimulating agents may decrease OS in cancer is still unknown.
Achieving higher hemoglobin levels may lead to higher
mortality from thrombotic events, as has been shown in a
study conducted in cardiac patients on hemodialysis
receiving erythropoietic-stimulating agents targeted to an
Hb level >14 g/dL.30 Cancer cells may express EPO
receptors, which are associated with activation of signaltransducing pathways that lead to increased cell survival
and proliferation, such as phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/
Akt and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of
transcription.31-35 An in vitro study has demonstrated
that EPO can induce resistance to imatinib in the BCRABL1-positive cell line K562.36 However, it must be
remembered that K562 is an erythroid cell line, which
could have influenced the results observed. In our paper,
we did not analyze patients in blast phase, who usually
present with a more aggressive phenotype and with additional genetic aberrations, more similar to advanced solid
tumors. It is possible that use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents could diminish OS in CML patients in blast
phase, but that remains to be proven.
In conclusion, the use of erythropoietic-stimulating
agents had no effect on response rate or survival in CML
patients in chronic phase receiving imatinib. The prevalence
of thrombotic episodes was higher in patients who were
receiving or had received erythropoietic-stimulating agents.
Development of severe (grade 3-4) anemia was an important
risk factor for response and survival in this patient population. Prospective trials studying a larger number of patients
are required to clarify the impact of long-term use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents in this patient population.
