ABSTRACT
Many studies have suggested that disialogangliosides, GD2 and GD3, are involved in
the development of various tumor types. However, the functional relationships between
ganglioside expression and cancer development or aggressiveness are not fully described.
GD3 is upregulated in approximately half of all invasive ductal breast carcinoma cases,
and enhanced expression of GD3 synthase (GD3S, alpha-N-acetylneuraminide alpha-2,8sialyltransferase) in estrogen receptor-negative breast tumors, was shown to correlate
with reduced overall patient survival. We previously found that GD2 and GD3, together
with their common upstream glycosyltransferases, GD3S and GD2/GM2 synthase,
maintain a stem cell phenotype in breast cancer stem cells (CSCs). In the current study,
we demonstrate that GD3S alone can sustain CSC properties and also promote malignant
cancer properties. Using MALDI-MS and flow cytometry, we found that breast cancer cell
lines, of various subtypes with or without ectopic GD3S-expression, exhibited distinct
GD2/GD3 expression profiles. Furthermore, we found that GD3 was associated with EGFR
and activated EGFR signaling in both breast CSCs and breast cancer cell lines. In addition,
GD3S knockdown enhanced cytotoxicity of the EGFR-inhibitor gefitinib in resistant MDAMB468 cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Based on this evidence, we propose that GD3S
contributes to gefitinib-resistance in EGFR-positive breast cancer cells and may be an
effective therapeutic target in drug-resistant breast cancers.

INTRODUCTION

Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing GSLs. The
disialogangliosides GD3 and GD2 have been characterized
as oncofetal markers [5]. In mice and other mammals,
they are expressed primarily at early stages of embryonic
development in central nervous system tissues. Their
expression becomes nearly undetectable within a few days
after birth [6]. GD3 and/or GD2 are frequently expressed
in ectoderm-derived tumors (e.g. neuroblastoma,
melanoma, T-cell leukemia, breast cancer) in adults, and
are therefore considered to be cancer-associated antigens
[7-9]. GD3, GD2, and certain other gangliosides are
thought of as promising targets for cancer immunotherapy
because their expression is restricted to malignant cells
and they are accessible on the cell surface.

Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are amphiphilic
membrane lipids consisting of a polar oligosaccharide
chain attached to a hydrophobic sphingosine-containing
ceramide lipid moiety. They are expressed ubiquitously
in animal cell membranes where they mediate cell
adhesion and signal transduction via lipid rafts [2].
Clusters of GSLs on the cell surface membrane interact
with functional membrane proteins such as growth factor
receptors (GFRs), integrins, and non-receptor cytoplasmic
protein kinases to form glycosynaptic domains, which
are involved in regulation of cell adhesion, growth, and
motility [3, 4].

Both GD3 and GD2 activate signaling molecules,
leading to distinctive phenotypes in different types of
cancer cells. In clinical studies by M. Kaufmann’s group,
GD3 synthase (GD3S; glycosyltransferase encoded
by the ST8SIA1 gene) was more highly expressed in
estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast tumors, and had
prognostic significance for ER status-dependent breast
cancer [10, 11]. In a study of tumorigenesis mechanism,
R.K. Yu’s group found that GD3 colocalized and
associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, a
mitogen receptor) in the microdomain structure of plasma
membrane [12]. Such interaction preserved EGFR levels
by employing an endosomal-plasma membrane recycling
pathway following endocytosis of EGF. In this way GD3
facilitated EGF-mediated signaling and regulated cell-fate
determination of neuronal stem cells. K. Furukawa’s group
observed high expression of GD3 in human melanoma and
small cell lung cancer. Upregulation of GD3 promoted
cell growth and invasion through integrin β1 assembly in
lipid rafts, and mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of focal
adhesion kinase, p130Cas, and paxillin [13, 14]. In studies
by P. Delannoy’s group, GD3S overexpression in breast
cancer cell lines increased cell proliferation and migration
in the absence of growth factors through activation of
c-Met, PI3K/Akt, and mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK)/ERK pathways [15]. Colocalization of GD2 and
c-Met was observed at the plasma membrane. Silencing of
GM2/GD2 synthase significantly reduced GD2 expression
and c-Met phosphorylation, and reversed the proliferative
phenotype [16]. Together, these findings suggest that
GD3S induction in breast cancer cells promotes tumor
aggressiveness.
GD2 was identified as a specific cell surface marker
of CD44hi/CD24lo breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) from
human breast cancer cell lines and patient samples [17].
Reduction of GD2 expression by ST8SIA1 knockdown
inhibited mammosphere formation and cell motility, and
completely blocked tumor formation in vivo, changing
the CSC phenotype to a non-CSC phenotype [17, 18].
Induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in
transformed human mammary epithelial cells markedly
increased expression of GD3S and GD2. Conversely,
inhibition of GD3S prevented metastasis by interfering
with initiation and maintenance of EMT [19]. GD3S
expression is correlated with constitutive activation of
the c-Met signaling pathway that leads to enhancement of
stem cell properties and metastatic potential. The GD3S/cMet axis may therefore be a useful target for treatment of
metastatic breast cancer.
In a previous study, we compared expression levels
of GSLs in breast CSCs vs. non-CSCs, and observed
notably higher expression of GD2 and GD3 in breast CSCs
[18]. Cell populations that expressed GD2/GD3 displayed
a CD44hi/CD24lo stem cell phenotype. Knockdown of
the genes for GD2 synthase (B4GALNT1) and GD3S
(ST8SIA1) significantly reduced GD2/GD3 expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and reversed the stem cell phenotype (e.g. mammosphere
formation and enhanced motility) of breast cancer cells
[18]. On the basis of these findings, we proposed a link
between GD2/GD3 expression and maintenance of breast
CSCs.
In the present study, we further investigated the
effects of GD2 and GD3 on tumor-related phenotypes of
breast CSCs. GD3S expression sustained CSC properties,
including the upregulation of ALDH activity, formation of
mammospheres, and expression of EMT markers. GD3S
overexpression also promoted malignant properties such
as cell migration, attachment, and colony formation.
Transfection of GD3S cDNA into breast cancer cell
lines MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468, and MCF7 cells
resulted in cell type specific upregulation of GD2 and
GD3. Furthermore, we found that GD3 colocalized and
associated with EGFR, and it activated EGFR signaling
in breast cancer cell lines and breast CSCs. In addition,
GD3S knockdown in triple-negative MDA-MB468 cells
resulted in increased sensitivity to gefitinib in vitro and
in vivo. These findings clearly demonstrate the positive
role of GD3S in maintaining CSC properties and in
malignant progression. In light of the observed GD3/
EGFR association in breast CSCs and breast cancer cell
lines, along with the increased gefitinib sensitivity in
GD3S-knockdown MDA-MB468 cells, we propose that
GD3S is involved in gefitinib-resistance of EGFR-positive
breast cancer cells, and can be considered as a potential
therapeutic target in gefitinib-resistant breast cancers.

RESULTS
GD3S sustains stem cell phenotype of breast
cancer cells
We demonstrated previously that GD3S, in
combination with downstream GSL products (GD2 and
GD3), plays a positive role in maintaining stem cell
properties in human breast CSCs [18]. To facilitate more
detailed studies of the biological roles of GD2 and GD3, we
established breast cancer cell lines that stably overexpress
GD3S by transfection of mammalian expression vector
containing full-length cDNA of human GD3S into MDAMB231, MDA-MB468, and MCF7 cells. GD3S mRNA was
quantified by real-time qRT-PCR. In comparison with mocktransfected cells, red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged cells,
or empty vector control cells, stable GD3S overexpression
produced striking (2000- to 5000-fold) increases in GD3S
mRNA levels in MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468, and MCF7
cells (Figure 1A, upper panel). The converse experiment of
GD3S knockdown (ST8SIA1 gene silencing) was performed
using a lentiviral-based expression vector carrying shGD3S.
In this case, real-time qRT-PCR indicated that GD3S
expression level was reduced by approximately 70% in
MDA-MB468 and roughly 60% in MDA-MB231 cells
(Figure 1A, lower panel).

GD3S enhances migration, adhesion, and
clonogenic growth of breast cancer cells

Aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 1 (ALDH1)
activity is a metabolic feature commonly used for
identification and analysis of CSC progression [20]. To
assess the contribution of GD3S to CSC properties, we
evaluated ALDH1 activity in GD3S-overexpressing and
-knockdown breast cancer cell lines. Presence and size of
cell populations showing measurable ALDH enzymatic
activity were determined by the ALDEFLUOR assay with
flow cytometry analysis (Figure 1B). Cells incubated with
ALDH1 substrate BAAA or ALDH1 inhibitor DEAB were
used to establish baseline fluorescence values and to define
ALDH1-positive populations. In GD3S-overexpressing
MDA-MB231, the percentage of ALDH1-positive cell
population was significantly upregulated, from 8.1% to
39.3%. In GD3S-overexpressing MDA-MB468 cells,
the ALDH1-positive percentage increased from 16.6%
to 35.1%. In MCF7 cells, GD3S overexpression had no
significant effect on ALDH1 activity. GD3S knockdown
by shGD3S caused a significant reduction in ALDH1positive percentage (from 16.6% to 2.8%) in MDAMB468 cells, but had no effect on ALDH1 activity in
MDA-MB231 cells (Figure 1B).
For MDA-MB468 cells, mammosphere formation
ability was approximately 3-fold higher in GD3Soverexpressing cells than in parental controls, but was
reduced to 26% of parental control levels in GD3Sknockdown cells (Figure 1C). GD3S knockdown reduced
mammosphere formation to 15% in MDA-MB231 cells
(Figure 1C). GD3S overexpression in MCF7 cells had
no effect on mammosphere formation ability (data not
shown).
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
an important mechanism in cancer metastasis, and is
involved in acquisition and maintenance of stem cell-like
characteristics [21]. GD3S-overexpressing MCF7, MDAMB231, and MDA-MB468 cell lines showed evidence
of EMT, including E-cadherin downregulation and
N-cadherin upregulation (Figure 1D). In addition, GD3Soverexpressing MDA-MB468 cells displayed upregulation
of vimentin, fibronectin, Twist, and Snail, which are
also indicators of EMT (Figure 1D). GD3S-mediated
upregulation of N-cadherin, vimentin and fibronectin,
three of the main markers of EMT, was confirmed at the
protein level by immunoblot (Figure 1E).
Taking these data together, the ALDEFLUOR
assay, mammosphere formation assay, and analysis of
EMT markers expression revealed differential effects of
GD3S overexpression on stem cell properties of the three
cell lines. In MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468, which are
triple-negative breast cancer (ER, PR, and HER2 negative;
TNBC) cell lines, GD3S overexpression enhanced stem
cell properties. In contrast, GD3S overexpression had
no effect on stem cell properties of MCF7, which is of
luminal type and ER and PR positive.

We further investigated the role of GD3S expression
in tumor phenotypes of TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB231
and MDA-MB468. Mechanisms that regulate wound
healing have been suggested to promote transformation
and growth of malignant cells. Moreover, wound healingrelated inflammatory cytokines and growth factors have
been identified as key contributors to the CSC niche [22].
We therefore examined how GD3S expression influences
cell migration using wound healing (scratch) assays. In
Figure 2A, GD3S-overexpressing MDA-MB468 cells
displayed a 2-fold increase in wound healing efficiency
in comparison with control RFP-tagged vector cells (left
panel). GD3S-knockdown in MDA-MB468 cells showed
no change in migration potential relative to control shLuc
cells (left panel). In contrast, GD3S-knockdown in MDAMB231 cells showed a significant reduction of migration
potential (from 50% to 36%) relative to shLuc cells
(Figure 2A, right panel). These findings demonstrate that
GD3S overexpression enhances cell migration. Because
GD3S promoted EMT in MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468
cells (Figure 1D), enhanced migration may be attributed
to the acquisition of an EMT-derived mesenchymal-like
phenotype.
Cell attachment and detachment properties in
the tumor microenvironment are determinants of cell
migration and invasion during metastatic processes
[13]. We examined the effect of GD3S knockdown on
attachment efficiency in MDA-MB468 cells. Two hours
after seeding, non-adherent cells were washed away, and
adherent cells were visualized by crystal violet staining.
The percentage of adherent cells was significantly
decreased (from 70% to 22%) in knockdown cells relative
to control cells (Figure 2B). Thus, attachment capacity
was reduced by GD3S knockdown, consistent with the
reduction of migration potential.
The colony formation assay (clonogenic assay) is
widely used for quantification of transforming potential
and for assessing the tumorigenic nature of cells [23].
Clonogenic growth potential of GD3S-knockdown
MDA-MB468 cells was significantly reduced (by 46.2%)
relative to mock-transduced controls (Figure 2C). This
finding suggests that GD3S expression is involved in
regulation of clonogenic growth potential, and may
therefore be correlated with clinical outcomes such as
tumor regrowth and disease relapse.
Our assays measuring CSC and cancer cell
properties (Figures 1 and 2) indicate that GD3S has
an oncogenic function in mammary epithelial cell
tumorigenesis. This oncogenic function includes
maintaining stem cell-like features and promoting cell
migration and transformation, particularly in TNBC and

a-series gangliosides (GM1, GM2, and GM3). The b-series
gangliosides (GD1, GD3) and globo-series GSLs (Gb4,
SSEA4 [monosialoGb5; MSGb5], disialoGb5 [DSGb5])
were detected at low levels. Relative to un-transfected
WT or RFP-tagged control cells, GD3S overexpression
resulted in upregulation of molecular ion signals
corresponding to GD2 and GD3, and downregulation of
signals corresponding to GM3, GM2, GM1, GD1, and
Gb4/(n)Lc4 (Figure 3B).
As shown in Figure 3C, WT MDA-MB468 cells
expressed predominantly GM1 and GD3, and low levels of
GM3, GT3, and GD1. Fucosyl-Lc4 were also detected at
low levels. GD3S overexpression in these cells resulted in
upregulation of signals corresponding to GD3 (not GD2),
and, to a lesser degree, increase of complex gangliosides
GT3 and GD1.
In WT MCF7 cells, the only highly expressed
ganglioside was GM2. These cells expressed mainly
neutral GSLs (Gb4, Gb5, and globo-H), and lower levels
of sialylated GSLs (GM3, MSGb5, and DSGb5). GD3S
overexpression led to upregulation of signals corresponding
to GD2, but not GD3 (Figure 3D). MS analysis revealed
increases of various globo- and lacto-series GSLs (Gb4/(n)
Lc4, Gb5, globo-H, MSGb5, and DSGb5) and to a lesser
degree, complex ganglioside GD1. In summary, findings
shown in Figure 3 clearly demonstrate the differential
effects of GD3S overexpression on GD2/GD3 expression
patterns in the three breast cancer cell lines.

Cell type-specific regulation of GD2/GD3
biosynthesis by GD3S expression
GD3S expression leads to distinctive phenotypes
in different breast cancer cell lines. We examined the
effect of GD3S expression on GSL biosynthesis by
measuring GSL expression in GD3S-overexpressing
MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468, and MCF7 cells.
Total GSLs were extracted, analyzed by HPTLC, and
visualized with orcinol spray (Figure 3A, upper panel).
The three cell lines showed distinctive GSL expression
patterns. GD2 and GD3 expression was confirmed by
TLC immunostaining with anti-GD2 mAb (14G2a) and
anti-GD3 mAb (R24) (Figure 3A, lower panels). GD2
was upregulated in MCF7 and MDA-MB231 cells, while
GD3 was upregulated in MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468
cells. GD3S-overexpressing MDA-MB468 cells showed
enhanced GD3 expression (with parental cells already
GD3-positive), but no detectable GD2 expression. In
contrast, GD3S-overexpressing MCF7 cells showed
enhanced expression of GD2 but not of GD3. Thus, GD3S
overexpression had differential effects on GD2 and GD3
expression in the three cell lines. More specifically, GD3S
overexpression resulted in expression of both GD2 and
GD3 expression in MDA-MB231 cells, GD3 expression in
MDA-MB468 cells, and GD2 expression in MCF7 cells.
Furthermore, differential GD2 and GD3 expression
patterns on the cell surface were confirmed by flow
cytometry analysis. The three cell lines were labeled
by anti-GD2 mAb (14G2a) or anti-GD3 mAb (R24)
conjugated with fluorophore. In representative histograms
(Figure 3B–3D, insets), gray peaks correspond to isotype
control and black lines correspond to ganglioside mAbspecific fluorescent signals. Flow cytometry analysis was
consistent with results of TLC immunostaining, and the
results demonstrate distinct, cell-type specific effects
of GD3S overexpression on GD2 and GD3 expression
patterns. Upregulated expression of both GD2 and GD3
were found in MDA-MB231 cells. GD3 (but not GD2)
was upregulated in MDA-MB231 cells, and GD2 (but not
GD3) was upregulated in MCF7 cells.
To evaluate changes of GSL profiles in the GD3Soverexpressing cell lines, purified GSLs were also analyzed
by MALDI-TOF MS (Figure 3B–3D). Identities of GSLs
in MS1 profiles were assigned based on m/z values for
major molecular ion signals, fitted to permethylation
of hexose, N-acetylhexosamine, deoxyhexose, and
N-acetylneuraminic acid residues, in combination with
typical sphingosine and fatty acyl components of common
ceramides. GSL structures were inferred on the basis of
known human GSL expression patterns.

Interaction of gangliosides and GFRs in breast
CSCs
Our 2013 study [18] indicated that GD2/GD3 and
their upstream glycosyltransferases, GD2/GM2 synthase
and GD3S, were upregulated in breast CSCs. Knockdown
of these enzymes reversed CSC properties, suggesting
the involvement of GD2/GD3 in maintenance of these
properties. In the present study, we evaluated the potential
for association between GFRs and gangliosides. This was
done to clarify the mechanism whereby association of
membrane protein molecules with GD2/GD3 maintains
stem cell properties of breast CSCs. Such associations
were first investigated by co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) experiments. Cell lysates from breast CSCs were
immunoprecipitated with anti-GD2 or anti-GD3 mAb and
then immunoblotted with anti-EGFR or anti-c-Met mAb.
GD3 associated with EGFR (Figure 4A, left panel), but
not with c-Met (Figure 4A, middle panel). GD2 associated
less obviously with c-Met (Figure 4A, middle panel), but
not with EGFR (Figure 4A, left panel). Consistent with a
previous report [24], integrin β1 associated with GD2, but
not with GD3 (Figure 4A, right panel).
Such ganglioside/GFR associations in breast CSCs
were further investigated by immunostaining. GD3 (red)
and EGFR (green) showed a high degree of colocalization
(yellow) (Figure 4B, upper panels). Consistent with co-IP

GD3S expression enhances EGFR signaling in
breast CSCs and breast cancer cell lines

results, GD2 (red) and c-Met (green) showed only partial
colocalization (yellow) (Figure 4B, lower panels).
Intracellular colocalization of gangliosides and
GFRs was evaluated by immunogold-TEM (Figure 4C).
Using two secondary Abs conjugated to gold particles
of different sizes, two different antigens (in this case,
ganglioside and GFR) can be visualized simultaneously
by TEM. Breast CSCs were double-labeled with 12 nm
(for gangliosides) and 6 nm (for GFRs) colloidal gold
particles. The distributions of differently-sized gold
particles indicate preferential colocalization of GD3
(12 nm particles) and EGFR (6 nm particles) (Figure 4C,
left panel). In contrast, GD2 (12 nm particles) was mostly
separated from c-Met (6 nm particles) (right panel).
In situ interactions of gangliosides and GFRs were
investigated by a proximity ligation assay (PLA). In this
technique, when a pair of PLA probes binds two molecules
that are in close proximity (< 16 nm), complementary
DNA strands conjugated to PLA probes are ligated,
amplified, and visualized as distinct points using a
fluorescent probe. In breast stem-like cancer cells, strong
PLA signals were observed for GD3/EGFR association,
whereas less obvious PLA signals were observed for
GD2/c-Met association (Figure 4D). Taken together, the
results in Figure 4 clearly demonstrate a novel GD3/EGFR
association in EMT-induced breast stem-like cancer cells.

To investigate the effects of GD3S expression on
EGFR signaling pathways, we examined EGFR protein
levels and downstream signaling in GD3S-expressing breast
CSCs and breast cancer cell lines by immunoblotting. In
comparison with non-CSCs, breast CSCs with high GD3S
expression showed increased levels of EGFR protein,
phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR), AKT (p-AKT), and
p44/42 MAPK (p-ERK1/2) (Figure 6A, left panel). Effects
of GD3S overexpression on EGFR signaling pathways in
MDA-MB468 and MCF7 cells were also examined. EGFR,
p-EGFR, p-AKT, and p-ERK1/2 levels were also upregulated
in the GD3S-overexpressing cells (Figure 6B). These findings
suggest that GD3S enhances CSC properties and tumor
phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EGFR signaling.

GD3S knockdown enhances sensitivity of TNBC
MDA-MB468 cells to gefitinib
Gefitinib, a therapeutic for certain types of breast,
lung, and other cancers, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor
that targets the ATP binding site in the cytoplasmic
domain of EGFR [25]. Most clinical studies have shown
limited efficacy of gefitinib against breast cancer [26].
In view of our findings that GD3 associates with EGFR
in breast stem-like cancer cells (Figure 4) and in GD3Soverexpressing breast cancer cell lines (Figure 5), and that
GD3S expression enhances malignant potential of breast
cancer cell lines (Figure 1 and 2), we hypothesized that a
combination of gefitinib treatment and GD3S knockdown
may be an effective therapeutic strategy to combat breast
cancer. MDA-MB468 cells were treated for 10 d with
0.01 μM gefitinib in combination with GD3S knockdown
(by shGD3S), after which clonogenic potential and
cytotoxicity were evaluated (Figure 7). In comparison with
parental or control shLuc cells, GD3S knockdown greatly
enhanced growth inhibition by gefitinib (Figure 7A), and
reduced the gefitinib IC50 value, after 48 h treatment, from
14.76 to 8.85 μM (Figure 7B). The differences between
growth inhibition rates of GD3S knockdown and mock
controls, at gefitinib concentrations of 2.5, 5, and 10
µM were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Thus, GD3S
knockdown sensitized breast cancer cells to the EGFR
kinase inhibitor gefitinib. The GD3S-knockdown-mediated
enhancement of gefitinib cytotoxicity and reduction of
gefitinib IC50 in TNBC cells (MDA-MB468) suggests that
GD3S regulation is a useful target for breast cancer therapy.

GD3/EGFR and GD2/c-Met association in
GD3S-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines
To investigate interactions between gangliosides
and GFRs, distributions of GD2, GD3, EGFR, and
c-Met in the same three cell lines were analyzed by
immunofluorescence staining and in situ PLA. In MDAMB231 cells, both GD2 and GD3 were expressed, and
GD2 colocalized with c-Met (Figure 5A), in agreement
with previous reports [15, 16]. In GD3S-overexpressing
MDA-MB231 cells, GD3 colocalized with EGFR
(Figure 5A, left panels). In situ PLA also demonstrated
GD3/EGFR and GD2/c-Met colocalization in GD3Soverexpressing MDA-MB231 cells (Figure 5A, right
panels). In GD3S-overexpressing MDA-MB468 cells,
which express high levels of GD3 but no GD2, GD3/
EGFR colocalization and association were demonstrated
by immunofluorescence staining (Figure  5B, left
panels) and in situ PLA (Figure 5B, right panel).
GD3S-overexpressing MCF7 cells express high GD2
but no GD3, and therefore showed no GD3/EGFR
colocalization signal. Despite the high GD2 expression
in these cells, both immunofluorescence staining and
in situ PLA revealed limited GD2/c-Met colocalization
or association (Figure 5C). Taken together, the results
from Figure 5 demonstrate an association between GD3
and EGFR in GD3S-overexpressing breast cancer cell
lines, consistent with findings from EMT-induced breast
CSCs shown in Figure 4.

NSG mice were injected via mammary fat pad with MDAMB468 cells transduced with lentivirus carrying control or
GD3S shRNA, to induce formation of tumors. Mice were
subsequently treated with gefitinib (dose 150 mg/kg) by
oral gavage twice weekly for 16 d. In comparison with the
group treated with gefitinib alone, the group treated with
gefitinib in combination with GD3S knockdown showed
significantly greater suppression of tumor growth (Figure
8A and 8B). Tumor volume and tumor weight were also
much lower in the gefitinib + GD3S knockdown group
than in the gefitinib-only group (Figure 8C and 8D).
These findings, taken together, indicate that GD3S inhibits
TNBC cell growth and enhances the tumor-suppressive
effect of gefitinib in vitro and in vivo.

found that CSCs had greatly reduced levels of Fuc(n)
Lc4Cer and Gb3Cer, and much higher levels of GD2,
GD3, GM2, and GD1a. Cell populations expressing
GD2 and GD3 displayed a CD44hi/CD24lo stem cell
phenotype. Knockdown of the gene encoding GD3S
(ST8SIA1) reduced both GD2 and GD3 expression,
while knockdown of the gene encoding GD2 synthase
(B4GALNT1) only reduced GD2 expression. Silencing
either of these two genes reversed the stem cell
phenotype (e.g. mammosphere formation and enhanced
motility) of breast cancer cells. However, silencing of
ST8SIA1 showed the most potent effect on suppression
of stem cell properties. These findings demonstrated
a positive functional role for GD2 and GD3 in breast
CSCs and suggested a possible approach to inhibiting
tumorigenic breast CSCs by targeting the GD2/GD3
synthase-related pathway. In the present study, we
performed a more detailed examination of the biological
impact of GD2 and GD3 in driving a stem cell phenotype
and enhancing tumorigenicity.

DISCUSSION
In our 2013 study [18], we compared GSL
expression profiles in breast non-CSCs and CSCs using
the EMT model developed by Weinberg’s group. We

Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease, in
terms of both pathology and molecular profiles. Various
molecular subtypes of breast cancer differ substantially
with regard to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment
[27, 28]. We therefore used three breast cancer cell
lines classified as different subtypes to investigate the
functional effects of GD3S. These cell lines were selected
to represent luminal-like and basal-like breast cancer
subtypes, according to gene expression studies [29–33].

MCF7 is a luminal-like cell line that is ER+ PR+ HER2-,
while MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468 are both TNBC,
based on the lack of ER, PR, and HER2. MDA-MB231
displays basal-like properties and is classified as claudinlow with enhanced invasive properties. MDA-MB468 is
basal-like with PTEN deletion and EGFR amplification.
After establishing stable GD3S-overexpressing cell
lines, we used pooled populations of antibiotic-selected
cells rather than isolated specific clones for biological

assays and GSL analysis. This was done to avoid clonal
variation.
In studies of the GD3S-overexpressing cell lines, we
observed enhanced EMT and ALDH expression in basallike TNBC cells, but not in luminal-type cells. This finding
is consistent with previous reports that GD3S expression
is necessary for maintenance of CSC properties in EMTinduced human mammary epithelial cells [17, 18]. S. Mani’s
group showed that inhibition of GD3S by shRNA or triptolide
prevented EMT, blocked metastasis, and depleted stem cell
populations [19]. By analyzing microarray data from 1,581
breast cancer samples, M. Kaufmann’s group showed that

GD3S expression was correlated with poor histopathological
grade (p < 0.001) [10, 11]. These previous and our current
findings indicate that GD3S is overexpressed in aggressive
breast cancers and plays a positive role in regulation of EMT
and stem cell function. Furthermore, the findings suggest
a novel therapeutic strategy to combat aggressive breast
cancers, which particularly targets therapy-resistant CSCs.
GSLs have been proposed to interact with specific
membrane molecules to modify signaling transduction
through carbohydrate-carbohydrate or protein-carbohydrate
interactions [34]. We used HPTLC, flow cytometry, and
MALDI-TOF MS analysis to establish comprehensive

GSL profiles of our three breast cancer cell lines and their
GD3S-overexpressing counterparts, and determine how
GD3S expression alters expression of individual GSLs,
affecting cancer cell and CSC phenotypes. GD3S catalyzes
transfer of sialic acid from CMP-sialic acid to GM3, to
produce gangliosides GD3 and GT3. GD3S is therefore the
key enzyme for biosynthesis of b- and c-series gangliosides.
We observed distinct GSL expression patterns in response
to GD3S overexpression in the three cell lines tested.
Interestingly, the three cell lines showed different GD2
and GD3 expression patterns after GD3S overexpression,
as measured by TLC immunostaining and flow cytometry
analysis, i.e., GD2+/GD3+ in MDA-MB231 cells, GD2-/
GD3+ in MDA-MB468 cells, and GD2+/GD3- in MCF7
cells. These differential GSL expression patterns provide
a reasonable explanation for the variable effects of
GD3S overexpression in cancer cells and CSCs. GD3S
overexpression also altered expression of several GSL
species besides GD2 and GD3. Future studies will address
the possible effects of such changes on cancer cell and CSC
phenotypes.
Our MS analyses revealed the presence of both
a-series (GM1, GM2, and GM3) and b-series (low-level
GD1 and GD3) gangliosides in WT MDA-MB231 cells.
GD3S transfection led to increased expression of b- and
c-series gangliosides. P. Delannoy’s group reported that
WT MDA-MB231 expressed only a-series gangliosides,
mainly GM3 and GM2 [15, 16], and that GD3Stransfected cells accumulated b- and c-series gangliosides.
The minor difference between the previous findings and
ours may be ascribable to differences in sensitivity of MS
analysis and/or GSL extraction methods. We observed
that MCF7 expresses both neutral and sialylated GSLs.
Following GD3S transfection, these cells also expressed
GD2 and the complex ganglioside GD1. Delannoy’s group
studied specific clones expressing high levels of b- and
c-series gangliosides and complex GSLs. They observed
accumulation of unusual tetra- and penta-sialylated
derivatives of LacCer, GQ3 (II3Neu5Ac4-Gg2Cer), and
GP3 (II3Neu5Ac5-Gg2Cer) in GD3S+ clones [35]. In
contrast, we observed no GQ3 or GP3 signals in our MS
spectra from pooled GD3S-transfectant populations. This
apparent discrepancy is likely due to differences between
individual clones and pooled populations, or it may be
attributed to methods used for cell sampling. Despite these
relatively minor differences, both studies show that WT
MCF7 express a complex GSL pattern including neutral
and sialylated GSLs.
Our combination of approaches to probe association
between gangliosides and GFRs (co-IP, IF, immunogoldTEM, and PLA) provides novel and consistent evidence
for strong GD3/EGFR association in breast CSCs and
breast cancer cell lines. In breast CSCs, the association
between GD2 and c-Met was observed but less obvious.
Moreover, GD3-positive cell lines (MDA-MB231 and
MDA-MB468 with GD3S overexpression) showed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

strong GD3/EGFR association, while GD2-positive cell
lines (MDA-MB231, MCF7 with GD3S overexpression)
showed GD2/c-Met association.
The involvement of gangliosides in regulating signal
transduction has been reported [36], and many GFRs are
either upregulated or downregulated by gangliosides
[37]. Signaling kinases and adaptor molecules (p130Cas,
paxillin, FAK) have been shown to respond to GD3
upregulation by conferring malignant phenotypes in
melanoma and osteosarcoma [14, 38]. Although, a direct
connection between these molecules and GD3 has not
been demonstrated. J. Wang and R.K. Yu reported that
the interaction between GD3 and EGFR maintained
EGFR signaling by enhancing cell surface EGFR stability
following endocytosis in mouse neural stem cells [12]. Our
co-IP and PLA results provide clear evidence for a GD2/cMet association, and are consistent with observations by P.
Delannoy’s group that GD2 is involved in c-Met activation
and subsequent activation of MEK/Erk and PI3K/Akt
signaling pathways, leading to enhanced breast cancer cell
migration and proliferation [15, 16].
EGFR mutations have potential application in
diagnosis and therapy of various human cancers. Gefitinib
is an EGFR kinase inhibitor that disrupts signaling by
blocking the EGFR kinase domain, and is therefore
effective only in cancers with activating EGFR mutations.
EGFR is highly expressed in more than half of TNBCs.
However, results of most breast cancer clinical trials
using EGFR kinase inhibitors as single agents have
been disappointing [39]. Negative results in these cases
result mainly from insufficient knowledge regarding
the complexity and heterogeneity of breast cancers.
Combination therapies that inhibit multiple aberrant
pathways have been proposed and applied in many clinical
trials designed to optimize anti-tumor efficacy and avoid
drug resistance [40].
A subset of TNBC is characterized by constitutive
EGFR activation and PTEN loss, which likely mediates
resistance to EGFR inhibitors [41]. Among the cell line
models we used in this study, MDA-MB468 cells have
EGFR amplification and also PTEN deficiency [42]. In
our study, sensitivity of MDA-MB468 cells to gefitinib
was significantly enhanced when cells were pretreated
with lentivirus carrying GD3S shRNA. K. Furukawa’s
group reported that GD3 was involved in triggering both
Erk and AKT signaling pathways in human melanoma
cell lines [40]. In another study, combined treatment with
gefitinib and the AKT inhibitor PI-103 had a synergistic,
anti-proliferative effect on MDA-MB468 cells [39]. GD3S
knockdown may therefore interfere with both Erk and
AKT signaling pathways simultaneously. This concept
would explain the strong suppression effect of combined
treatment with gefitinib and GD3S knockdown on growth
of PTEN-deficient, EGFR-overexpressing MDA-MB468
cells. Present and previous findings indicate that GD3 is
involved in multiple, convergent signaling pathways, and

its inhibition provides a basis for effective therapeutic
strategies against metastatic breast cancers. Thus, a
combination of GD3S knockdown (by shGD3S) and
EGFR kinase inhibition (by gefitinib) may be effective
against aggressive TNBC breast cancer cells that are
resistant to gefitinib alone.

Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Plus
Mini Kit (Qiagen). The first strand of cDNA was prepared
from 5 μg RNA using SuperScript III first-strand Synthesis
SuperMix (Invitrogen) with random primers, according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time qRT-PCR
was performed using 200 ng cDNA in a thermal cycler
(ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System; Applied
Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Relative quantities of mRNAs were determined using
the comparative threshold number (ΔΔCt method), with
genes for β-actin, GAPDH, and Ups11 as reference genes.
Primer sequences for qRT-PCR are listed in Table 1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Breast cancer cell lines MCF7, MDA-MB231,
and MDA-MB468 were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in
the recommended culture medium in a 37 °C incubator
with 5% CO2 atmosphere. HMLE-Twist-ER cells were
kindly provided by R. Weinberg (Whitehead Institute;
Cambridge, MA, USA) and grown in one part A medium
(Mammary Epithelial Growth Medium, Lonza, with10 μg/
mL insulin, 10 ng/mL EGF, 0.5 μg/mL hydrocortisone)
and one part B medium (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Medium, Gibco, with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
100 units/mL penicillin-streptomycin). To induce Twist
expression and consequent EMT, these cells were grown
in medium with 40 nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma) for
12 d. Previous studies by our group and others have clearly
shown that Twist-induced EMT of HMLE-Twist-ER cells
results in accumulation of cells with CSC properties
[17–19]. In the present study, we used this model and
considered HMLE-Twist-ER cells cultured in the absence
and presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen as breast non-CSCs
and CSCs, respectively.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity
ALDH activity of various cell lines was quantified
using an ALDEFLUOR® assay kit (STEMCELL
Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were harvested, placed in assay buffer, and incubated
for 45 min at 37°C to allow intracellular ALDH to convert
uncharged ALDH substrate (BAAA) to negatively charged
BAA. As a negative control, an aliquot of ALDEFLUORstained cells was quenched immediately with 1.5 mM
diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), a specific ALDH
inhibitor. Cells were analyzed using the green fluorescence
channel (FL1) on a SA3800 spectral cell analyzer (Sony
Biotechnology).

Mammosphere assay
Breast cancer cells (2 × 103) were plated in ultralowattachment 24-well dishes (Costar) in serum-free basal
medium supplemented with 1× B-27 and 10 ng/mL basic
fibroblast growth factor (Invitrogen). Each well was added
with fresh medium without removal of old medium at
2-day intervals. Cells grown under these conditions for
5–7 d at 37°C formed non-adherent spherical clusters
(mammospheres), which were counted under a light
microscope.

GD3S-overexpressing and GD3S-knockdown cell
lines
ST8SIA1 (NM_003034) human cDNA ORF clone
(cat. no. RG223851) was from OriGene. A full-length
cDNA fragment was PCR-amplified and sub-cloned
into a lentiviral vector pLAS2w.Pbsd (National RNAi
Core Facility; Taipei, Taiwan) or mammalian expression
vector pCMV-Tag2b (Stratagene). A shST8SIA1 clone
(small hairpin targeted GD3S; TRCN0000036045;
pLKO.1 vector) was from National RNAi Core Facility.
Lentivirus production was performed in a HEK293T
cell viral package system. Cell lines MDA-MB231 and
MDA-MB468 were transduced with GD3S full-length
cDNA or GD3S-short hairpin (sh) sequence containing
lentivirus with multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 2. MCF7
cells were transfected with recombinant pCMV-Tag 2B
vector containing GD3S full-length cDNA using FuGENE
6 transfection reagent. Stable clones were selected with
blasticidin (5 μg/mL) for pLAS2w.Pbsd vector, puromycin
(1 μg/mL) for pLKO.1 vector, and G418 (500 μg/mL) for
pCMV-Tag 2B vector. Antibiotic-resistant clones were
pooled to avoid clonal variation.

Wound healing (scratch) assay
Cells grown to a confluent monolayer were gently
scratched (wounded) with a pipette tip, washed twice with
medium to remove detached cells, and then provided with
fresh medium. Cell migration during wound healing was
monitored by taking phase contrast images on an inverted
microscope with a Live Cell Imaging system (model
DMi6000, Leica). Wound areas were estimated by analysis
of images using the Image J software program. Wound
closure percentage was calculated as: [(area of original
wound - area of actual wound)/ area of original wound]
×100.

solubilized in distilled water, and the resulting solution
was applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Varian) for
desalting.
GSLs were analyzed using HPTLC plates
(EMD Bioscience) and developed in a solvent system
of CM/0.5% aqueous CaCl2 (50:40:10). GSLs were
visualized by spraying with 0.5% orcinol in 1 M sulfuric
acid. For immunostaining, the plates were dried, fixed
with 5% (w/v) poly (isobutyl methacrylate) in hexane/
chloroform (9:1), blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA in PBS,
probed with anti-GD2 mAb (Clone 14.G2a, #554272,
BD Biosciences) or anti-GD3 mAb (R24 clone, ab 11779,
Abcam), and incubated with appropriate horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary Abs. GSLs were
detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
detection kit (Pierce).

To assess cell attachment, cells were trypsinized,
plated onto flat-bottom tissue culture plates (Falcon)
(4 × 105 cells/ well), and allowed to adhere for 6 h.
Medium was then removed, non-attached cells rinsed
away, and attached cells fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
and stained with crystal violet (0.1%).

Colony formation assay
MDA-MB468 cells were plated in 6-well plates (600
or 300 cells/well), treated with or without gefitinib (Sigma)
and/or shGD3S lentivirus (MOI = 10) for 48 h, washed
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and medium was
replaced by fresh medium. After 10 d incubation, cells
were fixed with 70% ethanol, stained with crystal violet,
and colony number was counted under a light microscope.

GSL extraction, HPTLC analysis, and
immunostaining

MALDI-TOF MS profiling analyses of
permethylated GSLs were performed on a TOF/TOF 5800
system (Sciex; Canada) using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid
as matrix (10 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile). Permethylated
derivatives were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile solution.
An aliquot of each sample solution was premixed with an
equal amount of matrix solution, and spotted on a MALDI
plate. Each MALDI-TOF MS spectrum was acquired
automatically in 2000 laser shots with random sampling
acquisition.

GSLs were extracted as described previously
[3]. In brief, 2 × 108 cells were extracted by successive
sonication in the following four solvents (each 10 mL): (i)
chloroform/methanol (CM) (1:1), (ii) isopropanol/hexane/
water (IHW) (55:25:20, lower phase), (iii) IHW (55:25:20,
lower phase), and (iv) CM (1:1). The combined extracts
were evaporated and dissolved in 6 mL CM (2:1). The
solution was added with 1 mL water to give CM/water
(CMW) 4:2:1, shaken, and allowed to separate into upper
and lower phases. The lower phase was added with 3 mL
CM/0.1% NaCl (1:10:10), shaken, and allowed to separate
into upper and lower phases. This step, known as the Folch
partition, was repeated three times. The upper phases were
combined, washed with 0.5 mL CM (2:1), evaporated, and

In situ proximity ligation assay (PLA)
Interactions among gangliosides and GFRs were
assessed using an in situ PLA kit (Duolink) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cells (2 × 104) grown
on 8-well slides (ibidi) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
in PBS for 15 min at RT, blocked with Duolink blocking
solution at 37°C for 30 min, washed with PBS, incubated
overnight at 4°C with primary Abs (mouse anti-GD2,
mouse anti-GD3, rabbit anti-EGFR, and rabbit anti-c-Met,
as described above), washed with PBS, incubated 1 h at
37°C with secondary Ab (anti-mouse PLA-plus probe or
anti-rabbit PLA-minus probe; Duolink; dilution 1:50),
washed twice (5 min each time) with Duolink Wash buffer
A, added with Duolink ligation mixture, incubated 30 min
at 37°C, washed twice with Wash buffer A, added with
Duolink amplification mixture and Polymerase, subjected
to amplification reaction for 100 min at 37°C, washed twice
with Wash buffer B and once with 0.1× Wash buffer B,
and mounted with Duolink In Situ Mounting Medium with
DAPI. Fluorescence dot images were obtained by confocal
immunofluorescence microscopy as above.

Immunofluorescence cell staining
Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature
(RT), and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS
for 5 min. Fixed cells were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS
for 30 min, incubated overnight at 4°C with primary Ab,
washed, incubated 1 h at RT with secondary Ab, and
counterstained with DAPI (Pharmingen). Coverslips were
mounted with glycerol mounting medium (Dako) and
sealed with clear nail polish. Fluorescence images were
obtained by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy
(model TCS SP8; Leica).
Primary Abs used for immunofluorescence staining
were anti-GD2 (mouse, Clone 14.G2a, #554272, BD
Biosciences), anti-GD3 (mouse, clone R24, ab 11779,
Abcam), anti-EGFR (rabbit, ab32562; Abcam), and anti-cMet (rabbit, sc-10, Santa Cruz). Secondary Abs used were
Alexa555-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and donkey

Cells were harvested with trypsin, plated in 96-well
plates (1.5 × 103 cells/ well), left for 24 h to recover, and
treated with gefitinib at various concentrations (1.25 to 20
μM) for 48 h. AlamarBlue dye was added to each well
(10% of well volume) and incubated 4 h. Fluorescence
was measured on a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader
(Molecular Devices; USA) at excitation wavelength 560
nm, emission wavelength 590 nm. Growth inhibition rate
was calculated as (1 - mean fluorescence value of drugtreated samples/mean fluorescence value of untreated
controls) × 100%.

Mouse xenograft model and in vivo
tumorigenicity
MDA-MB468 cells (5 × 106) stably expressing
control lentiviral construct (shLuc) or GD3S shRNA
(shGD3S) were harvested and mixed with Matrigel for
subcutaneous injection into the mammary fat pads of 5
week old female NOD/SCID/IL2Rgamma null (NSG)
mice. Once the tumors were palpable, the mice in each
group were randomly allocated to treatment groups
with four animals each: (1) no treatment (control) or
(2) gefitinib (twice weekly by oral gavage at dose of
150 mg/kg). Tumor growth was monitored by caliper
measurements of two perpendicular diameters three times
weekly, and the volume of the tumor was calculated with
the formula V = (length×width2) × (π/6). NSG mice were
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, and bred in our
animal facility under Specific-pathogen-free conditions.
All procedures were performed in compliance with the
Regulations for the Institutional Animal Care and User
Committee of Chang-Gung University.
