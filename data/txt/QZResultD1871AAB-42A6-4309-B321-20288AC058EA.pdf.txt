Abstract
Members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily,
particularly the AKR1C subfamily, are emerging as important
mediators of the pathology of cancer. Agents that inhibit these
enzymes may provide novel agents for either the chemoprevention or treatment of diverse malignancies. Recently,
jasmonates, a family of plant stress hormones that bear a
structural resemblance to prostaglandins, have been shown to
elicit anticancer activities both in vitro and in vivo. In this
study, we show that jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate
(MeJ) are capable of inhibiting all four human AKR1C
isoforms. Although JA is the more potent inhibitor of
recombinant AKR1C proteins, including the in vitro prostaglandin F synthase activity of AKR1C3, MeJ displayed greater
potency in cellular systems that was, at least in part, due to
increased cellular uptake of MeJ. Moreover, using the acute
myelogenous leukemia cell lines HL-60 and KG1a, we found
that although both jasmonates were able to induce high levels
of reactive oxygen species in a dose-dependent fashion, only
MeJ was able to induce high levels of mitochondrial
superoxide (MSO), possibly as an epiphenomenon of mitochondrial damage. There was a strong correlation observed
between MSO formation at 24 hours and reduced cellularity at
day 5. In conclusion, we have identified AKR1C isoforms as a
novel target of jasmonates in cancer cells and provide further
evidence of the promise of these compounds, or derivatives
thereof, as adjunctive therapies in the treatment of cancer.

Introduction
It is becoming increasingly clear that human aldo-keto
reductases (AKR) of the AKR1C family are intimately linked with
cancer biology. For example, AKR1C enzymes activate xenobiotic
polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) proximal carcinogens in vitro.
The in vivo importance of this is strongly supported by
observations that AKR1C3 polymorphisms modulate risk for lung
cancer due to exposure to PAH-rich coal combustion emissions
(1). Furthermore, AKR1C3 polymorphisms have been shown to
modulate risk of other cancers, including childhood leukemias,
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and carcinomas of the prostate and
bladder (2–5). Separately, it has been recently shown that AKR1C3
inactivates the anticancer drugs doxorubicin and oracin (6). Thus,

the ability of AKR1C3 to use xenobiotics as substrates is linked with
both the etiology of cancers and therapeutic resistance.
We have previously shown that AKR1C3 regulates myeloid cell
differentiation. Treatment of HL-60 cells with the AKR inhibitors
indomethacin or medroxyprogesterone acetate enhances both
neutrophil and monocyte differentiation (7, 8), and reciprocally,
overexpression of AKR1C3 suppresses HL-60 differentiation (8, 9).
More recently, we have shown that knockdown of AKR1C3 in K562
cells results in erythroid differentiation (10). We have therefore
proposed AKR1C3 as a novel regulator of myeloid cell differentiation and a potential new therapeutic target in leukemia. Similarly,
others have identified AKR1C3 as a possible target in prostate and
breast carcinoma (11, 12). Equally, other studies have identified
AKR1C2 and AKR1C1 as potential targets for the treatment of
prostate, breast, lung, and bladder carcinomas (12–15). Thus, the
availability of AKR1C-selective inhibitors would be of value in the
chemoprevention of cancers, in use as adjuvant therapies in
combination with established chemotherapeutics and as direct
therapeutic interventions in their own right. In recognition of this,
several laboratories have undertaken structural studies of AKR1C3
bound to inhibitors and substrates and embarked on the
identification of lead compounds for drug development (16–21).
An established approach to identifying new drugs is to identify
natural products from plants with the desired activities (22).
Several structurally and functionally diverse plant hormones,
including auxins (23), cytokinins (24), and jasmonates (25, 26),
have been shown to possess anticancer properties. Jasmonates are
fatty acid–derived cyclopentanones that are structurally similar to
prostaglandins in metazoans. Members of the jasmonate family
include jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJ; Fig. 1),
which have been shown to play major roles in defense against
insects and disease, as well as during plant growth and
development (27). The cytotoxicity of jasmonates has been shown
in vitro against cancer cell lines derived from colon, breast, lung,
prostate, melanoma, and glioma as well as leukemia cell lines and
primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples (25, 28–30). Oral
administration of jasmonates was also found to improve the
survival of mice that had been engrafted with a murine T
lymphoma cell line (25). Furthermore, combinatorial treatment of
leukemia cell–bearing mice with MeJ and the anthracyclin
doxorubicin increased survival of mice compared with those
treated with either agent alone (28).
A key activity of AKR1C3 not shared by the other AKR1C
enzymes is the metabolism of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) into
9a,11h-prostaglandin F2a (9a,11h-PGF2a; ref. 31). PGD2 spontaneously dehydrates to J-series prostaglandins, which culminates in
the formation of 15-deoxy-D12,14PGJ2 (15dPGJ2). This highly
bioactive prostaglandin is a peroxisome proliferator–activated
receptor-g ligand, inhibits nuclear factor-nB, and elevates reactive
oxygen species (ROS; refs. 32–35). Therefore, it is inhibition of the

that results in elevated 15dPGJ2 and promotes differentiation of
myeloid leukemia cell lines.1
Due to the structural similarity of jasmonates and prostaglandins (Fig. 1), we wished to investigate whether AKR1C3 represents
a novel target for the antitumor activities of jasmonates. Using
both recombinant protein and cell-based assays, we show that both
MeJ and JA inhibit members of the AKR1C subfamily, including
AKR1C3. Furthermore, we show that the treatment of the acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines HL-60 and KG1a with both
JA and MeJ results in the dose-dependent production of ROS,
specifically mitochondrial superoxide (MSO), which seems to
correlate with killing of these cell lines.

Materials and Methods
Unless otherwise stated, reagents were purchased from Sigma.
Cloning, production, and purification of recombinant AKR1C
proteins. DNA encoding full-length AKR1C1, AKR1C2, and AKR1C4
(accession numbers NM_001353, NM_001354, and NM_001818) was
obtained from Gene Service Ltd. and cloned into pET28b (Novagen).
Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells to produce
NH2-terminally His6-tagged recombinant proteins. These were expressed,
extracted, and purified along with recombinant AKR1C3 (rAKR1C3) as
previously described (19).
Enzymatic assays of phenanthrenequinone reduction. Phenanthrenequinone was dissolved in acetonitrile to make a 5 mol/L stock and
subsequently diluted further in acetonitrile. Assays for all four human
rAKR1C enzymes were performed using 15 Ag recombinant protein in
50 mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing h-NADPH
(15 Amol/L) and between 1.25 and 20 Amol/L of phenanthrenequinone at
35jC. JA or MeJ was used at concentrations of 20, 100, or 400 Amol/L. For all
assays, acetonitrile and ethanol levels were constant at 2% (v/v) each. Initial

velocities were determined by measuring the change in absorbance of
pyridine nucleotide at 340 nm (e = 6,270 mol/L 1 cm 1) in a 1 mL volume.
The K i and type of inhibition were calculated using the Visual Enzymics
program (Softzymics).
Cells. HL-60 and KG1a cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 100 units/mL penicillin and
100 Ag/mL streptomycin (both from Invitrogen Ltd.).
Assessment of jasmonate uptake into cells. To ensure that no
differential extraction of jasmonates was observed, extractions of
intracellular JA and MeJ was performed alongside samples containing
equal quantities of either jasmonate (2 Amol of each) alone or combined.
To assess uptake of jasmonates into HL-60 and KG1a cells, 1  107 cells
were cultured in 24-well plates in a final volume of 1 mL RPMI 1640 for
15 min at 37jC in the presence of either 10 mmol/L JA or MeJ before
harvesting tubes and washing in PBS. Following centrifugation, the
supernatant was aspirated and cell pellets were lysed by the addition of
500 AL of 50% (v/v) aqueous methanol and vortexed for 1 min before
microfuge centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. The resulting
supernatants were acidified by addition of 80 AL concentrated HCl with
1 mL dichloromethane on ice. Tubes were vortexed for 1 min before
centrifugation at 374  g for 10 min. Following the removal of the upper
aqueous layer, the dichloromethane phase was dried at 55jC under a stream
of nitrogen before being redissolved in 50 AL of 50% (v/v) aqueous
acetonitrile.
Extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) using a 5-Am C18 column (Grace Davison Discovery Sciences).
Jasmonates were separated using a gradient from 2% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1%
(v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to 98% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) TFA
gradient. Cell-free extracts (5 AL) and 20 AL cell extracts were injected onto
the column. Relative amounts of jasmonates were assessed at 210 nm. Peak
areas were calculated by Chromeleon Client software (Dionex).
Analysis of PGD2 metabolism by TLC. Either 2  107 pretreated cells or
3 Ag of recombinant protein were incubated in a final volume of 200 AL PBS
in 96-well plates with 0.2 ACi of [3H]PGD2 (Amersham) and the addition of
the appropriate treatment. Prostanoids were extracted from the supernatant and separated using TLC as previously described (36). Once dry, TLC
plates were scanned using a Bioscan AR-2000 plate reader. The migration of
prostanoids was identified by their comigration with known standards as
revealed by incubation in iodine vapor.
Cell treatments. JA and MeJ were dissolved in ethanol to make 1 mol/L
stocks and stored at 20jC. For use in viability and flow cytometry assays,
cells were seeded at 2.5  105/mL as 4 mL cultures in 25 cm2 flasks and
treated with a serial dilution of each agent (a range between 4 and
0.25 mmol/L), with carrier added to the control cultures. To prevent cells
from becoming overconfluent, cells were reseeded on days 2 and 4 at
2.5  105/mL in the presence of the relevant concentration of jasmonates.
For use in PGD2 turnover assays, cells were seeded at 5  105/mL as 8 mL
cultures in 25 cm2 flasks and treated overnight with either 1 mmol/L JA,
1 mmol/L MeJ, or carrier control.
Cell viability assay. At day 5, duplicate 200 AL volumes of each
treatment were transferred from the 25 cm2 flasks to a 96-well plate before
the addition of 20 AL CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability Assay reagent (Promega).
Following mixing, the plate was incubated for 4 h at 37jC, and
subsequently, fluorescence was measured at an excitation of 530/25 nm
and emission of 595/35 nm on a KC4 fluorometer (Bio-Tek Instruments).
Fluorescence bears a direct relationship to cell viability in cultured cells.
Background readings were assessed using wells containing medium alone,
and these measurements were subtracted from readings obtained for
samples. To account for differences in readings due to the different feeding
regimens on days 2 and/or 4, results were adjusted accordingly to account
for cells that were removed from the cultures.
Assessment of mitochondrial depolarization and generation of ROS
and MSO. All analyses were carried out by flow cytometry on a
FACSCalibur using CellQuest Pro (Becton Dickinson) software. Mitochondrial inner membrane potential was assessed using 5,5¶,6,6¶-tetrachloro1,1¶,3,3¶-tetraethylbenzimidazol-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1), which was
dissolved at 5 mg/mL in DMSO and stored at 20jC and for experimental

use was further diluted to 1 mg/mL in PBS. At 24 h after treatment, 200 AL
of cell suspension were diluted to 1 mL with warm PBS with the addition of
JC-1 at a final concentration of 10 Ag/mL and incubated at 37jC, 5% CO2 for
10 min. Subsequently, the samples were washed with 1 mL PBS,
resuspended in 300 AL PBS, and kept on ice until analyzed.
Carboxy-H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes) is a membrane-permeable
compound that is used to assess all cellular ROS. It was dissolved in DMSO
to yield a 2000 stock and stored under nitrogen at 20jC. Immediately
before use, a 2 (10 Amol/L) working dilution was made in warm PBS. At
24 h after treatment, 200 AL of cell suspension were mixed with 200 AL of
the working stock and incubated at 37jC, 5% CO2 for 40 min before analysis
by flow cytometry (emission wavelength, 517–527 nm).
MitoSOX Red (Molecular Probes) was used to assess the presence of
MSO. Before use, MitoSOX Red was dissolved in DMSO to yield a 5 mmol/L
stock and subsequently diluted to a working concentration of 5 Amol/L in
warm PBS. At 24 h after treatment, 200 AL of cell suspension were
centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and 200 AL of working stock
were added followed by incubation at 37jC for 10 min before analysis by
flow cytometry (emission wavelength, 580 nm).

Results
Jasmonates inhibit AKR1C activity. Due to the structural
similarities between jasmonates and PGD2, we hypothesized that
these plant hormones may be able to inhibit AKR1C3. Although not
a natural substrate, phenanthrenequinone represents a useful tool
to study the inhibitory effects of compounds against AKR1C
isoforms because most, if not all, members of this subfamily readily
catalyze its reduction (18).2 We therefore investigated the
inhibition by jasmonates of the NADPH-dependent reduction of
phenanthrenequinone by rAKR1C proteins. Both MeJ and JA
competitively inhibited rAKR1C3, with JA displaying greater
potency than MeJ with a K i greater than 5-fold lower (Table 1).
Similarly, both JA and MeJ inhibited rAKR1C1 and rAKR1C2, but
only JA was found to be able to sufficiently inhibit rAKR1C4 at the
doses tested here. Importantly, JA displayed greater inhibition for
all four rAKR1C enzymes than MeJ.
Jasmonates inhibit AKR1C3 PGD2 11-keto reductase activity.
To identify whether jasmonates could also inhibit the PGD2 11-keto
reductase activity of AKR1C3, we performed a series of enzyme
assays using rAKR1C3 and [3H]PGD2 and assessed inhibition
following separation of the products using TLC (Fig. 2A). The
production of 9a,11h-PGF2a was decreased by both jasmonates in
a dose-dependent fashion. Once again, JA was found to be the more
potent inhibitor of this activity of rAKR1C3, reaching significance
when used at 400 Amol/L (P = 0.025).
To assess the effects of jasmonates on cellular AKR1C3 activity,
KG1a cells were treated with either 1 mmol/L JA, 1 mmol/L MeJ, or
ethanol (solvent control) overnight before incubation with
[3H]PGD2. KG1a cells are derived from a patient with AML and
display reasonable levels of PGD2 11-keto reductase activity (10).
Interestingly, in these cellular assays, MeJ displayed a significantly
greater inhibition of AKR1C3 than JA (Fig. 2B and C). These
findings are in contrast to the in vitro inhibition of rAKR1C3
described above.
JA and MeJ display differential cellular uptake. Although the
compounds are very similar, MeJ is a more lipophilic compound
than JA. We therefore considered the possibility that the enhanced
cellular potency of MeJ compared with JA to inhibit AKR1C3 may

2

be due to better accessibility into cells. We further hypothesized
that the ester group of MeJ may be a target of cellular esterases,
converting it to JA. To test these two hypotheses, HL-60 cells, an alltrans retinoic acid–sensitive cell line derived from a patient with
AML (37), and KG1a cells, a cell line derived from a patient with
AML that comprises highly undifferentiated blasts (38, 39), were
exposed to jasmonates and cells were extracted to assess both
uptake and metabolism using HPLC (Fig. 3). Interestingly, we did
not find any evidence to suggest that MeJ was converted to JA
intracellularly (Fig. 3A; data not shown). However, significantly
more MeJ was recovered from cell extracts than JA (P = 0.006;
Fig. 3A and B). These data indicate that the greater potency of MeJ
in cells is indeed associated with increased accessibility.
We proceeded to investigate whether the actions of jasmonates
against AML cells are similar to those observed in response to
other AKR inhibitors and if jasmonate effects on AML cell lines
mirror those reported in other cancer cells. Furthermore, we
wanted to assess whether MeJ is more potent than JA.
Jasmonates reduce cell viability of myeloid leukemia cell
lines. Both JA and MeJ reduced cellular viability in a dosedependent fashion, with MeJ being much more potent than JA. By
day 5, there were very few, if any, viable cells remaining in doses
>1 mmol/L MeJ, whereas at the same time point viable cells could
readily be detected even at the highest dose of JA tested (4 mmol/L;
Fig. 4A). These findings are in accordance with those of Fingrut and
colleagues (25) using cell lines derived from T lymphoblastic
lymphoma, melanoma, pancreatic carcinoma, and breast carcinoma. Together with our above observations, these data suggest that
jasmonates mediate their antiproliferative actions via intracellular
activities.
Jasmonates induce increased levels of ROS in myeloid
leukemia cells. ROS, including hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl
radicals, and superoxide anions, are produced in cells as a
consequence of electron leakage from the electron transport chain
and can have detrimental effects on cells, causing lipid peroxidation, DNA adduct formation, and protein oxidation (40). ROS
levels are significantly elevated in cancer cells when compared with
their nontransformed counterparts (41). This has been proposed to
represent an ‘‘Achilles’ heel’’ and increasing ROS levels in tumor
cells may present a valid goal for cancer therapy (42). Importantly,
Oh and colleagues (30) showed that treatment of glioma cells with
jasmonates leads to elevated ROS levels. We therefore, investigated
whether jasmonates induce the production of ROS in myeloid
leukemic cells. Interestingly, 24-hour exposure to either MeJ or JA

induced the dose-dependent formation of ROS in both HL-60 and
KG1a cells (Fig. 4B). Although the effects of JA on ROS formation
were again less pronounced than MeJ, they were notably more
marked than the effects of JA on cell killing (Fig. 4). The data
therefore indicate that the greater potency of MeJ to induce
myeloid leukemic cell killing is not likely to be primarily due to its
ability to induce elevated levels of ROS simply because JA also

low FL-2 signal is observed. As shown in Fig. 5A, 0.5 mmol/L MeJ
significantly increased the proportion of HL-60 and KG1a cells
displaying high FL-1/low FL-2 fluorescence indicative of mitochondrial depolarization (P = 0.0057 for HL-60 and P = 0.0002 for

than that of JA, which caused little or no increase in mitochondrial
membrane depolarization at the doses tested. To further analyze

the mitochondrial toxicity of jasmonates in intact cells, we next
measured the generation of MSO, a by-product of the electron
transport chain, forming as the result of inappropriate reaction
between oxygen and electrons that have leaked from the
respiratory chain.
Treatment of both HL-60 and KG1a cells with MeJ led to dosedependent increases in MSO formation (Fig. 5B). However, there
were very few cells that were positive for the production of MSO
when treated with JA. Notably, there seemed to be an inverse
correlation between the dose responses for MeJ-induced MSO
generation and cell survival responses shown in Figs. 4A and 5B.
Thus, the superior cell killing effects of MeJ over JA seem to be
associated with the targeting of mitochondria and the generation
of MSO rather than generic ROS generation. However, it remains to
be determined whether the MeJ-induced MSO occurs as a direct
effect of MeJ treatment or if it is in fact an epiphenomenon due to
mitochondrial damage.

Discussion
Increasingly, natural products from plants are being identified
as possessing antitumor activities. Among many classes of
molecule, these include plant hormones such as cytokinins (24)
and auxins (23). Included in this list are members of the
jasmonate family. There is a growing body of work investigating
the antitumor effects of jasmonates both in vitro and in vivo (25,
26). Of particular interest here is the potential of jasmonates or
derivatives thereof in hematolymphoid malignancy. The earliest
reports of jasmonate activities included suppressed proliferation
and induced apoptosis of AML, lymphoblastic leukemia, and
lymphoma cell lines (25, 43, 44). This activity was shown to be
selective because normal peripheral blood lymphocytes were
spared even in mixed populations with chronic lymphocytic
leukemia cells (29). Importantly, MeJ was shown to have in vivo
activity in mice bearing EL-4 lymphoma xenografts (44).
Previous studies have implicated jasmonates in rapidly and
selectively depleting cellular ATP in cancer cells by suppressing
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation with the resultant
generation of ROS. However, we observed ROS generation in
response to both MeJ and JA and this did not correlate with the far
more potent cytoreductive activities of MeJ compared with JA.
Instead, the potent actions of MeJ were found to strongly correlate
with the specific generation of MSO. It therefore appears that it is
more specifically the generation of MSO rather than overall ROS
that triggers differentiation and apoptosis. Previously, the Flescher
lab has shown that jasmonates directly target mitochondria (29, 45,
46). It therefore remains to be determined whether the MSO
generation reported here is a direct effect of MeJ or is an
epiphenomenon of mitochondrial damage. Furthermore, Ishii and
colleagues (43) previously showed that MeJ-promoted HL-60 cell

differentiation was associated with increased mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) activity. Treatment of HL-60 cells with
the MAPK inhibitor PD98059 both diminished this activation
and the differentiation seen in response to MeJ. This is of
interest because activation of MAPK has recently been identified
as a downstream effect of jasmonates in plants (47). Furthermore, a link has been suggested by Traore and colleagues (48)
between increased mitochondrial-derived ROS and MAPK
activation during myeloid differentiation. Taken together, these
studies may suggest a link between MeJ-induced MSO generation
and the subsequent activation of MAPK.
We and others have identified AKRs of the human AKR1C family
as potential novel targets in leukemias, lymphomas, and solid
tumors. Here, we have shown for the first time that jasmonates act
as inhibitors of these enzymes. Importantly, although JA was the
more potent inhibitor of rAKR1C proteins, MeJ jasmonate was
better able to enter cells and accordingly was a better inhibitor of
cellular AKR1C3 activity. The ability to inhibit AKRs adds to a
growing list of potential mediators of the anticancer activities of
jasmonates.
Besides studying the direct antitumor activities of Jasmonates,
it is important to consider their exploitation as adjunctive
therapy. In this regard, it is worth noting that AKR1C family
members have been implicated in the inactivation of established
chemotherapeutics, including daunorubicin, doxorubicin, and
oracin (6, 49). Heyfets and Flescher (28) showed that administration of doxorubicin alongside MeJ had additive cytotoxicity
compared with either agent alone against murine BCL1 leukemic
cells both in vitro and in vivo. It is possible that this
cooperativity displayed may be due, at least in part, to inhibition
of the reduction of doxorubicin to the less toxic doxorubicinol
by AKRs.
In conclusion, we have shown that AKR1C family members
represent novel cellular targets for MeJ in both in vitro and cellular
assays. It is this activity allied to the observations by others that
MeJ can activate the MAPK pathway, as well as deplete cellular ATP
levels, particularly in cancer cells that make this compound an
exciting and a potentially important starting point for drug
development.
