ABSTRACT
Shedding of the human NKG2D ligand MIC (MHC class I-chain-related molecule)
from tumor cell surfaces correlates with progression of many epithelial cancers.
Shedding-derived soluble MIC (sMIC) enables tumor immune escape through
multiple immune suppressive mechanisms, such as disturbing natural killer (NK)
cell homeostatic maintenance, impairing NKG2D expression on NK cells and effector
T cells, and facilitating the expansion of arginase I+ myeloid suppressor cells. Our
recent study has demonstrated that sMIC is an effective cancer therapeutic target.
Whether targeting tumor-derived sMIC would enhance current active immunotherapy
is not known. Here, we determined the in vivo therapeutic effect of an antibody
co-targeting sMIC with the immunostimulatory IL-15 superagonist complex, ALT803, using genetically engineered transplantable syngeneic sMIC+ tumor models.
We demonstrate that combined therapy of a nonblocking antibody neutralizing sMIC
and ALT-803 improved the survival of animals bearing sMIC+ tumors in comparison
to monotherapy. We further demonstrate that the enhanced therapeutic effect with
combined therapy is through concurrent augmentation of NK and CD8 T cell antitumor responses. In particular, expression of activation-induced surface molecules
and increased functional potential by cytokine secretion are improved greatly by the
administration of combined therapy. Depletion of NK cells abolished the cooperative
therapeutic effect. Our findings suggest that administration of the sMIC-neutralizing
antibody can enhance the anti-tumor effects of ALT-803. With ALT-803 currently in
clinical trials to treat progressive solid tumors, the majority of which are sMIC+, our
findings provide a rationale for co-targeting sMIC to enhance the therapeutic efficacy
of ALT-803 or other IL-15 agonists.

cells, and in some cases primed cytotoxic T cells [5, 6].
Neutralization of NKG2D was shown to increase the
incidence of carcinogen-induced tumor formation [8]. In
the spontaneous prostate tumor model TRAMP (transgenic
adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate), mice deficient
in NKG2D exhibited accelerated tumor progression in
comparison to their NKG2Dwt counterparts [9]. Enforced
expression of membrane-bound NKG2D ligands on
TRAMP tumors prevented disease progression through
sustained NKG2D signaling in effector cells [10]. These
studies have collectively demonstrated the importance of
NKG2D signaling in active tumor immune surveillance.

INTRODUCTION
Ligand-induced activation of the NK cell activating
receptor NKG2D has been demonstrated to be significant
in controlling tumor growth in experimental animal
models [1, 2]. NKG2D, an NK cell group 2 member D
activating receptor, is also expressed by most NKT cells,
subsets of gamma-delta T cells, all human CD8+ T cells,
and activated mouse CD8+ T cells as co-stimulatory
receptors [1, 3–7]. Ectopic expression of NKG2D ligands
results in effective tumor rejection mediated by NK

The most prevalently expressed NKG2D ligands
in human malignancies are the MHC class I-related
molecules A and B (MICA/B, collectively termed MIC)
[11–14]. However, human cancer cells frequently evade
NKG2D signaling through protease or exosome-mediated
shedding of MIC to produce the immune suppressive
soluble MIC (sMIC). Clinically, levels of sMIC correlated
with disease stage in many malignancies [10, 15–19].
Mechanistically, sMIC shed from tumor cells has been
shown to down-modulate surface NKG2D expression
on NK cells and effector NKT and T cells [17, 20, 21].
Very recently, we have further shown that sMIC perturbs
NK cell homeostatic maintenance in tumor-bearing
hosts and facilitates the expansion of arginase I+ myeloid
suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment [10, 22].
These studies suggest that sMIC may be a valid target for
immunotherapy to re-instate endogenous NK and effector
T cell anti-tumor immune responses. Our recent study has
provided proof for this concept [14].
The common gamma-chain cytokine interleukin-15
(IL-15) is considered as one of the most promising
cytokines for cancer immunotherapy [23–27]. IL-15 not
only is important for maintaining NK cell homeostasis
[28–33], but also can upregulate NKG2D expression on
NK and T cells and prime NKG2D signaling pathways
[34–37]. IL-15 has also been shown to be important for
maintaining CD8+ memory T cell populations [38–42].
The IL-15 superagonist ALT-803, a complex of the mutant
IL-15 (IL-15N72D) and the IL-15RαSu/Fc [43, 44],
was shown to confer at least 25-fold higher bioactivity
in vivo and extended half-life compared to native IL-15
[45]. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that a single
dose of ALT-803 was able to eliminate well-established
primary myeloma cells in the bone marrow and to further
reject tumor re-challenge due to expansion of CD44hi
memory CD8+ T cells [45]. These pre-clinical studies have
signified the cancer therapeutic potential of ALT-803 and
have led to the current clinical trials for treating various
human malignancies [46]. However, due to the facts that
mice do not express human MIC and the human oncoimmune dynamics of NKG2D ligand shedding and tumor
progression have not been described in these mouse models,
the impact of tumor-derived immune suppressive sMIC on
the therapeutic potential of ALT-803 remains unknown.
To overcome the limitation that mice do not express
human MIC, we have developed syngeneic transplantable
tumor models in which sMIC-overexpressing mouse tumor
cell lines were implanted into the sMIC-tolerant transgenic
mouse [10]. Using this transplantable system, we tested the
hypothesis that ALT-803 and a sMIC-neutralizing antibody
can generate a cooperative therapeutic anti-tumor effect.
We demonstrate that combinatory therapy of an antibody
targeting sMIC and ALT-803 significantly enhanced the
survival of mice bearing sMIC+ tumors in comparison with
monotherapy. Mechanistically, we show that combined
therapy cooperatively enhanced the homeostatic maintenance
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and functional potential of NK cells and memory CD8+ T
cells. Combinatory therapy also heightened the potential of
CD4+ T cells to produce IFN-γ and cooperatively eliminated
myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in tumor
infiltrates. We also demonstrate in vitro that ALT-803 and
a sMIC-neutralizing antibody cooperatively enhanced the
activation of STAT5 signaling pathways in effector cells. Our
findings provide the rationale for a translational approach
whereby combinatory therapy of an antibody targeting
tumor-derived sMIC and ALT-803 can cooperatively enhance
innate and adaptive anti-tumor responses.

RESULTS
ALT-803 and sMIC-neutralizing antibody
combined therapy inhibits tumor growth and
prolongs survival of animals bearing sMIC+
tumors
Tumor shedding of sMIC is a human-specific
mechanism of tumor immunoevasion. To test the hypothesis
that targeting sMIC can enhance the therapeutic potential
of IL-15 superagonist ALT-803 in a pre-clinical model,
we developed multiple transplantable syngeneic tumor
models by: 1) overexpressing human soluble MICB in
transplantable mouse tumor cell lines, and 2) inoculating
tumor lines secreting sMICB into the MICB transgenic
mouse. As membrane-bound MIC can stimulate anti-tumor
immunity [10], in order to eliminate experimental variation,
we chose to develop these tumor models using the soluble
form of MICB instead of membrane-bound MIC. Since mice
do not express homologs of the human MIC ligand family,
we utilized MICB transgenic mice as hosts to eliminate the
effect of autoantibodies against the human sMICB. The
MICB transgenic mice were produced by using the minimal
rat probasin (rPb) promoter to direct expression of the
transgene encoding the native form of MICB to the prostate
epithelium. These mice have a similar phenotype as wild
type B6 animals; however, they do not generate immune
responses to syngeneic tumors expressing human MIC [10].
We implanted the murine mouse prostate tumor
cell line RM9 and melanoma cell line B16F10 that were
engineered to express human sMICB (designated as RM9sMICB and B16-sMICB respectively) subcutaneously into
cohorts of syngeneic MICB transgenic mice. When tumors
reached approximately 75–100 mm3 in volume, mice
were randomized into four therapeutic groups (n = 8–10
per group, Figure 1a). Although monotherapy with the
sMIC-neutralizing antibody B10G5 and ALT-803 elicited
survival benefits in comparison to control treatment,
combined therapy further significantly prolonged survival
in comparison to monotherapy in two independent tumor
transplants (p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001 respectively, Figure
1b and 1d). Using linear regression analyses, we compared
tumor growth rate prior to animals in the control group
(or any treatment group) reaching the survival endpoint.

B10G5 or ALT-803 monotherapy significantly reduced
tumor growth rate by 35% and 51%, respectively, in
comparison to control IgG treatment, whereas combined
therapy further reduced tumor growth rate by 60%
(Figure 1c). We observed similar trends in mice bearing
B16-sMICB tumors (Figure 1d). Monotherapy with either
B10G5 or ALT-803 reduced the average tumor burden by
about 50%, whereas combined therapy further reduced
tumor burden by more than 70% (p < 0.001) (Figure 1e).
The enhanced therapeutic effect of combined therapy was
further confirmed by the significant reduction in final B16sMICB tumor weight in comparison to monotherapy in
repeated experiments in which all animals were euthanized
at day 10 of therapy (p < 0.01) (Figure 1f). Similar trend
in survival benefit and tumor growth rate with combined
therapy in comparison to monotherapy was presented with
treatment up to 55 days where majority (>90%) of animals
reached defined survival end point (data not shown). These
data clearly demonstrate that monotherapy of ALT-803
or the sMIC-neutralizing antibodyB10G5 has respective
therapeutic effects; however combined therapy elicited
significantly enhanced therapeutic effects.

ALT-803, indicating enhanced NK cell activation with
combination treatment. No significant change in other NK
cell surface receptor expression, such as NKp46, Ly49A,
Ly49C/I/F/H, NKG2A/C/E, was observed with combined
therapy in comparison to monotherapy (data not shown).
We further tested functional potential of NK cells
from these mice by responses to ex vivo re-stimulation.
NK cell IFNγ production in response to ex vivo PMA/I
stimulation or degranulation shown by CD107a expression
in response to NKG2D ligand-positive RMA-S-RAE-1β
stimulation was significantly increased with monotherapy
of B10G5 or ALT-803 (Figure 2f–2h). When B10G5 and
ALT-803 were combined, therapy resulted in a further
significant increase in the number of IFNγ-producing
NK cells in response to PMA/I stimulation and the
level of NK cell degranulation in response to RMAS-RAE1β stimulation (Figure 2f–2h, Supplementary
Figure 1c and 1d). These data clearly demonstrate that,
in comparison to monotherapy, combined therapy
significantly enhanced innate NK cell anti-tumor potential
by further restoring homeostatic maintenance and
function.

NK cell number and function

Combined therapy enhances functional
potential of CD8 T cells
We next sought to determine the effects of
combined therapy on adaptive immunity, primarily CD8+
T cells, as ALT-803 has been demonstrated to enhance
CD8+ populations in vivo [48]. As shown in Figure 3a,
in mice bearing B16-sMICB tumors, monotherapy of
B10G5 or ALT-803 increased splenic CD8 numbers
by 75% and 860%, respectively, compared to control
treatment. With combined treatment, splenic CD8
numbers further increased significantly compared to
monotherapy with B10G5 (p < 0.005) or ALT-803
(p = 0.05) (Figure 3a). The frequency of NKG2D+CD8+
T cells was significantly increased in both the spleen
and dLN with monotherapy of B10G5 or ALT-803
compared to control IgG therapy (Figure 3b and 3c,
Supplementary Figure S2a). With combined treatment,
splenic NKG2D+CD8+ T cell populations and the
intensity of NKG2D expression (measured by MFI) on
NKG2D+CD8+ T cell were further markedly increased in
comparison to monotherapy of B10G5 (p < 0.05) or ALT803 (p < 0.01) (Figure 3b and 3c; Supplementary Figure
S2a). Since NKG2D is only expressed by activated CD8+
T cells in mice [49], these data indicate a cooperation
of B10G5 and ALT-803 in activating CD8+ T cells.
This conclusion was further confirmed by examination
of CD25+ CD8+ T cells populations (Figure 3d and 3e;
Supplementary Figure S2b).
Previous studies have shown that ALT-803 can
increase CD44hi memory CD8+ T cell populations in
tumor-bearing hosts [45]. Consistent with these studies,
monotherapy with ALT-803 increased the population

We sought to understand mechanisms associated
with the enhanced efficacy of combined therapy. Tumorderived soluble MIC not only impairs NK cell function
by downmodulating surface NKG2D expression but also
perturbs peripheral NK cell maintenance [10, 21]. We
first investigated the therapeutic effect of monotherapy
and combined therapy on NK cells. As representatively
shown with the B16-sMICB tumor model, in response
to monotherapy with B10G5 or ALT-803, not only the
number of NK cells (CD3−NK1.1+) but also the level
of NKG2D expression, measured by the percentage of
NKG2D+ NK cells and the mean fluorescence intensity
(MFI) of the NKG2D expression on NKG2D+ NK cells,
in the spleen and tumor-draining inguinal lymph nodes
(dLN) was markedly increased in comparison to the
control treatment group (Figure 2a–2c and Supplementary
Figure  S1a). However, combined therapy resulted in
further significant increase in the number of NK cells
and the level of NKG2D expression on cells in the spleen
and dLN compared to monotherapy (Figure 2a–2c;
Supplementary Figure S1a). Moreover, significantly
increased activation of NK cells as evaluated by surface
CD25 expression, was also observed in response to
therapy, either by monotherapy of B10G5 or ALT803(Figure 2d and 2e; Supplementary Figure  S1b).
A further significant increase in surface CD25 expression
on NK cells was elicited with combination therapy
in comparison to monotherapy (Figure 2d and 2e;
Supplementary Figure S1b), either with B10G5 or

(Figure 3h and 3i; Supplementary Figure S2d). To a lesser
extent than ALT-803, B10G5 therapy also significantly
increased the number of splenic IFN-γ-producing and CD8+
T cells. With the combined therapy of ALT-803 and B10G5,
CD8+ T cells elicited a markedly enhanced response to
re-stimulation in comparison to monotherapy (Figure
3h and 3i, Supplementary Figure S2d). Moreover, with
combined therapy, CD8 T cells exhibited greater cytotoxic
responses shown by increased CD107a degranu­lation with
melanoma peptide antigen gp100 stimulation (Figure 3j
and 3k, Supplementary Figure S2e). Together, these data
have suggested that combined therapy of B10G5 and ALT803 cooperatively not only can improve the generally
machinery responsiveness of CD8 T cells in sMIC+ tumorbearing mice, but also can enhance antigen-specific effector
CD8 T cell responses.

of memory-like CD44hi CD8+ T cells in both the spleen and
dLN. B10G5 alone resulted in a significant increase in CD44hi
CD8+ T cells in the spleen, but not in the dLN. Intriguingly,
a remarkable increase in the population of CD44hi CD8+ T
cells in both spleen and dLN was elicited as a result of the
combined therapy (Figure 3f and 3g; Supplementary Figure
S2c). These data demonstrate the cooperative effect of ALT803 and B10G5 in generating or likelihood maintaining
memory CD8+ T cells in the tumor-bearing host.
IL-15 has been shown to revive CD8+ T cells from
an anergic state in tumor hosts [50–52]. sMIC has been
shown to impair NKG2D expression and thus the function
of CD8+ T cells [20]. These findings prompted us to
evaluate whether there is a combined therapeutic effect
on CD8+ T cell function. Consistent with other studies,
ALT-803 therapy significantly increased the frequency and
total number of splenic IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells in

Combination therapy of B10G5 and ALT-803
heightens CD4+ T cell anti-tumor potential

ALT-803 or B10G5. However, the combination of ALT803 and B10G5 only cooperatively further enhanced
STAT5 phosphorylation at a significant level (Figure 6b).
Given that STAT5 is essential for NK cell survival and
maintaining memory CD8 T cells function, these data
suggest that, at the cellular level, the combined therapy
of ALT-803 and B10G5 cooperatively enhances NK cell
survival and presumably CD8+ T cell memory function.
Given that AKT is critical for cellular survival and NK cell
effector function, our data also suggest that monotherapy
of ALT-803 or B10G5 can respectively enhance cellular
survival and NK cell functional potential although with a
lesser magnitude than the combined therapy.

IL-15 has been shown to be important in driving
TCR-dependent expansion of CD4+ T cells and
maintaining memory function [53–56]. Thus, we sought
to determine our combined therapeutic effect on CD4+ T
cells. ALT-803 monotherapy had a trend of reduced total
CD4 T cell population in the spleen (p = 0.049), however,
combined therapy did not significantly impact total CD4
numbers in the spleen (Figure 4a). Neither monotherapy
with B10G5 or ALT-803 nor combined therapy had a
significant impact on total CD4+ T cell numbers in tumordraining LNs (Figure 4a). Monotherapy of B10G5 or
ALT-803 had differential impact on potentiating CD4+ T
cell to Th1 responses in the spleen and dLN. As shown by
IFNγ production in response to in vitro PMA/ionomycin
re-stimulation, B10G5 therapy resulted in a better
Th1 response in the spleen, whereas ALT-803 therapy
remarkably potentiated CD4+ T cells to Th1 responses in
the spleen and dLN (Figure 4b–4d).

Depletion of NK cells eliminates the cooperative
effect of B10G5 and ALT-803
As both sMIC and IL-15 pose significant effect
(negative and positive respectively) on NK cell
homeostasis and function, we thus addressed the impact of
NK cells in the combined therapeutic effect. As shown in
Figure 7, depletion of NK cells abolished the cooperative
therapeutic effect of B10G5 and ALT-803, although
monotherapy or combined therapy respectively exhibited
significant inhibition in tumor growth and prolonged
survival. Given that B10G5 or ALT-803 therapy alone
has been shown to enhance cytotoxic CD8 T cell function
(Figures 3 and 4), the respective therapy effect under the
depletion of NK cells is reasonably anticipated.

B10G5 and ALT-803 reduce MDSC populations
in TILs
We have recently shown that tumor-derived sMIC
can facilitate the expansion of immune suppressive
MDSCs, generally defined as CD11b+Gr-1+ cells [22].
Consistent with our previous findings, neutralizing sMIC
significantly reduced the population of MDSCs in RM9sMICB tumor infiltrates. ALT-803 monotherapy did not
significantly impact MDSC population in tumor infiltrates.
However, the combination therapy of B10G5 and ALT803 significantly reduced the MDSC population in tumor
infiltrates with a trend of further reduction in comparison
to B10G5 monotherapy (Figure 5). We also observed a
similar trend toward decreased MDSC frequency in TILs
isolated from mice bearing B16-sMICB tumors (data
not shown). These results demonstrate that B10G5 can
enhance the therapeutic efficacy of ALT-803 through
cooperatively eliminating MDSC-mediated immune
suppression.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we demonstrated for the
first time that the combination therapy of the IL-15
superagonist ALT-803 with a monoclonal antibody B10G5
targeting soluble MIC confers a significant survival benefit
in comparison to monotherapy in sMIC+ tumor hosts. We
showed that the combination therapy not only decreased
the rate of tumor growth but also prolonged survival of
animals bearing primary tumors in two independent
sMIC+ syngeneic tumor models. Mechanistically, we
further demonstrated that combined therapy cooperatively
enhanced homeostasis and function of NK cells, functional
potential of effector CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, and the
expansion or sustainability of memory CD8 T cells. We
further demonstrated in vitro that, in the presence of tumorderived sMIC, ALT-803 and an antibody neutralizing
sMIC cooperatively enhanced STAT5 signaling pathways,
which are critical for maintenance of NK cell homeostasis,
memory CD8+ T cells, and responses of effector CD8+ T
cells in vivo [57–60]. Finally, we demonstrated that NK
cells played a significant role in generating the cooperative
therapeutic effect.
Human tumor-shed soluble MIC was considered
as a viable target for immunotherapy, rationalized by
its immune suppressive effect on NK cells and effector
T cells and its ability to facilitate the expansion of

Combined therapy cooperatively enhances
STAT5 signaling
To further understand the potential cellular
mechanisms whereby combined therapy of B10G5 and
ALT-803 enhances NK functionality, purified mouse
splenic NK cells were co-cultured with the murine
prostate cancer cell line RM9 overexpressing sMICB
(RM9-sMICB) in the presence of IgG, B10G5, ALT803, or the combination of ALT-803 and B10G5. We
analyzed the activation status of AKT and STAT5, the two
essential molecules for cell survival and effector function.
As shown in Figure 6a, the levels of AKT and STAT5
phosphorylation were both increased in the presence of

MDSCs [10, 14, 22]. We have previously shown that
MIC neutralization can decrease lung micrometastases
of sMIC+ tumors and restore NK cell populations and
proliferation [10]. In this study, we demonstrated that
ALT-803 administration further increased the functional
potential of NK, CD4+, and CD8+ cells in combina­
tion with a sMIC-neutralizing antibody. Our find­
ings are consistent with published pre-clinical studies
demonstrating the immune stimulatory effect of ALT803. Xu et al. have shown that in models of murine
multiple myeloma, ALT-803 therapy induced expansion
of memory CD8+ T cells with upregulated NKG2D
expression and increased secretion of IFN-γ; in addition,
the effect of ALT-803 was shown to be independent of
antigen-specific stimulation [45]. Gomes-Giacoia et
al. showed that combination therapy of ALT-803 and
intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in a rat
bladder cancer model resulted in an enhanced therapeutic
effect compared to monotherapy. Gomes-Giacoia et al.
further demonstrated that the enhanced combinatory
therapeutic effect is associated with increased serum and
urinary cytokine levels (IL-1α, IL-1β, and RANTES),
increased NKG2D+ NK populations in the spleen and

peripheral blood, and increased NK infiltration into the
bladder [61]. These published studies strongly support
the underlying mechanisms associated with the enhanced
therapeutic effect of ALT-803 and a sMIC-neutralizing
antibody as demonstrated in our current study.
Our data demonstrate that combined therapy not
only increased NKG2D expression on CD8+ T cells but
greatly increased the population of CD44hi memory CD8+
T cell subset. While the role of IL-15 and ALT-803 in
generating and maintaining CD8+ memory populations has
been well established [38, 45, 62–64], the understanding
of NKG2D in memory CD8+ T cell homeostasis is
limited. Studies by Andre et al. utilizing transgenic mice
constitutively expressing the human NKG2D ligand MICA
demonstrated that functional NKG2D was dispensable for
the generation of memory CD8+ responses but necessary
for effector functions of reactivated memory cells [65].
Other studies by Zloza et al. demonstrated that NKG2D
was important for expansion and maintaining function
of memory cells upon reactivation [66]. Zloza et al also
demonstrated that IL-15 was crucial for rescue of memory
resulting in enhanced cytokine secretion and cytolysis
[66]. These limited investigations have suggested that

NKG2D is critical for sustaining the immunity of activated
memory CD8+ T cells. Provided that IL-15 has been welldemonstrated in upregulating NKG2D expression and
priming NKG2D signaling pathways, it is reasonable to
conclude that the increase in NKG2D function to enhance
both effector and memory CD8+ T cell function confers
a critical mechanism for the cooperative combinatory
therapeutic effect.
We show that the combined therapy also cooperatively potentiated CD4 T cells to Th1 responses
represented by a significant increase in IFN-γ production
in response to re-stimulation, whereas monotherapy only
elicited a limited and inconsistent impact in the spleen and
dLN. Our observations are consistent with published stud-

ies demonstrating that NKG2D+CD4+ T cells are prone to
Th1 cytokine secretion upon co-triggering of IL-15 and
NKG2D [67]. Moreover, it has been shown that IL-15
requires IL-12 to cooperatively stimulate Th1 cytokine
production by CD4+ T cells [68]. In this sense, because
activated dendritic cells (DC) in the dLN are the major
in vivo source for IL-12, it is thus anticipated that ALT-803
may promote Th1 responses by CD4+ T cells in the dLN as
we have observed. NKG2D is normally absent in CD4+ T
cells but is expressed by a rare population of effector CD4+
T cells in tumor hosts or virally infected individuals [67,
69]. It is an intriguing question how NKG2D signaling
alone may regulate potentiation of CD4+ T cells to a Th1
response and warrants further investigation.

Figure 6: Combined therapy cooperatively sustains STAT5 activation in NK cells in the presence of tumor-derived
soluble MIC. NK cells derived from spleens of B6/Rag1−/− mice were co-cultured in a 1:1 ratio with sMICB-RM9 cells in the presence

of control mIgG, B10G5 (10 μg/ml), ALT-803 (71 ng/ml), or combination of B10G5 and ALT-803. At 36 h of co-culture, live cells were
gated for CD45+NK1.1+ and analyzed for AKT and STAT5 phosphorylation with intracellular staining and flow cytometry analyses. No
IL-2 was present in the co-culture. a. Histograms representatively show the phosphorylation status of AKT and STAT5 in NK cells in

Tumor-associated MDSCs have been shown
to be highly immune suppressive through negatively
regulating the function of multiple lymphocyte subsets
[70, 71]. MDSCs can inhibit the function of CD8+ and
dendritic cells though arginase activity and induce the
anergy of NK cells through membrane-bound TGFβ1
[72–75]. MDSCs can expand dramatically during
tumor progression by tumor-secreted growth factors
and cytokines [76, 77]. We have recently shown that
tumor-shed sMIC can directly facilitate the expansion of
MDSCs through upregulating STAT3 pathways [22]. IL15 or its agonists have not been shown to play a direct
role in regulating MDSC expansion or activity, thus
it is anticipated that ALT-803 therapy may only have

marginal effect in the population of MDSCs in tumor
infiltrates. With B10G5 neutralizing sMIC, we show
in this study a significant decrease in the population
of MDSCs in tumor infiltrates than ALT-803 treatment
alone. As tumor-derived growth factors have been shown
to favor the expansion of MDSCs, it is possible that the
reduction of MDSC in the tumor infiltrated with the
combined therapy is the result of smaller tumor burden.
However, since we have shown that neutralizing sMIC
reduces the number of MDSC in tumor infiltrates [22],
it is also conceivable that the reduction of MDSC may
have alleviated its immune suppressive effects on both
NK and CD8 T cells and thus cooperatively inhibited
tumor growth.

IL-15 can activate several signaling cascades,
including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and STAT5 pathways in
effector T and NK cells [78, 79], but the enhancement of
signaling in the context of MIC neutralization has not been
previously studied. STAT5 has been shown to be essential
for NK maturation, peripheral maintenance, and function
[57]. Phosphorylation of STAT5 correlates with levels of
IL-15 trans-presentation [80]. However, recent studies have
shown that IL-15-primed NK cells also require intact PI3K/
AKT/mTOR signaling for optimal cytotoxicity, cytokine
secretion, and proliferation [81]. These studies suggest
that STAT5 and AKT are the two most essential pathways
in maintaining the homeostasis and function of NK and
memory CD8+ T cells. We show that the combination
therapy cooperatively enhanced activation of STAT5
pathways and that monotherapy respectively enhanced
activation of AKT pathways in NK cells. Although we
did not extend our analyses to other cell types, one could
anticipate similar outcomes in CD8+ T cells. However, it
is interesting that the combined therapy only demonstrated
limited impact on activating AKT pathways at cellular
levels, presumably due to a feedback regulatory mechanism
to control normal cellular homeostatic balances.
In summary, given the global immune suppressive
nature of human tumor-derived sMIC and the cancer
therapeutic potential of the IL-15 superagonist complex
ALT-803, which is currently in clinical trials to treat
advanced malignancies, our findings provide the rationale
for combination therapy of an antibody targeting sMIC
and ALT-803 to improve clinical outcomes.

consisted of IL-15 with the N72D mutation and the sushidomain of soluble IL-15Ra fused to the human Fc region
of IgG1. Generation of the anti-MIC mAb B10G5 was
also previously described [10]. B10G5 is a non-blocking
sMIC-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, which neutralizes
free sMIC but does not block the interaction of MIC with
the receptor NKG2D [14].

Tumor inoculation and in vivo experiments
RM9-sMICB and B16F10-sMICB cells were
implanted subcutaneously into cohorts of syngeneic B6/
MICB male mice (n = 8–10 per group) (4 × 105 cells/
mouse) at ages 8–10 weeks old. When tumor volume
reached approximately 75–100 mm3, animals were
randomized into four therapy groups (n = 8–10 per group):
1) control mouse IgG (3.0mg/kg BW); 2) anti-MIC mAb
B10G5 (3.0mg/kg BW); 3) ALT-803 (0.2 mg/kg BW); and
4) B10G5 and ALT-803. All therapies were given via I.P.
routine twice weekly. In some studies, mice received antiNK1.1 (PK136, BioXcell) antibody twice weekly via I.P.
to deplete NK cell during therapy. Tumor volume of 1000
mm3 was defined as survival endpoint. After euthanization,
spleens, tumor draining lymph nodes and tumors were
harvested for analyses.

Ex vivo cytokine re-stimulation and
cytotoxicity assay
Single-cell suspensions of splenocytes and tumor
draining lymph nodes were stimulated at 37˚C for 6 hr
with 50 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and 500
ng/ml ionomycin. Cells were harvested and analyzed by
flow cytometry for intracellular IFN-γ. For cytotoxicity
assay, we use CD107a expression as a marker for
NK and CD8 T cells degranulation in response to restimulation. Specifically, for CD8 T cell function, single
cell suspension of bulked splenocytes or tumor draining
lymph nodes from B16-sMICB mice was stimulated with
1 μg/ml of melanoma peptide antigen gp100 overnight
with addition of PE-labeled anti-CD107a antibody in the
culture. For NK cell cytotoxicity assay, NK cells isolated
from the spleens were incubated with MHC-I-deficient
NKG2D ligand RAE-1β expression RAM-S-RAE-1β
cells at 4:1 ratio for 5 h with addition of PE-labeled antiCD107a antibody in the culture. 1 μM Golgi Plug was
added to the culture 4 h before flow cytometry assay.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice and cell lines
Mice were bred and housed under specific
pathogen-free conditions in the animal facility at the
Medical University of South Carolina in accordance with
institutional guidelines with approved IACUC protocols.
All mice used in this study were male rPB-MICB mice
on the B6 background as previously described [10].
Transgenic progeny were identified by PCR analysis of
DNA extracted from tail biopsies using the forward primer
specific for rPB (5′-ACAAGTGCATTTAGCCTCTCCAG
TA-3′) and the reverse primer specific for MICB
(5′-TGTGTCTTGGTCTTCATGGC-3′).
sMIC-expressing RM9-sMICB and B16F10sMICB cell lines were developed by transduction with a
IRES-GFP retroviral vector containing the construct for
recombinant soluble MICB, as described previously [47].
sMIC+ cells were selected by puromycin and further by
flow cytometry sorting for GFP-positive cells.

In vitro co-culture assay
NK cells were generated from spleens of Rag1−/−
mice as described elsewhere. Briefly, single cell
suspensions of splenocytes from Rag1−/− mice were
seeded at 37ºC for 2 h to remove adherent cells. Nonadherent cells were collected and cultured in 1000U/
ml of IL-2 for 3–4 days before being harvested for
experiments. Cells were > 95% CD3−NK1.1+ at harvest

ALT-803 and B10G5 antibody
Generation and characterization of ALT-803 was
previously described [48]. Briefly, ALT-803 is a complex

(data not shown). NK cells were co-cultured with RM9sMICB cells at 1:1 ratio for up to 36 hours in the presence
of control mIgG (10 μg/ml), anti-MICB mAb B10G5 (10
μg/ml), ALT-803 (71 ng/ml), or a combination of B10G5
and ALT-803. Of note, no IL-2 was present in the coculture. Suspension cells were harvested for analyzing
phosphorylation status of pAKT and pSTAT5 in NK
cells using flow cytometry by intracellular staining. NK
cells were identified by surface CD45 and NK1.1 double
positive staining.
