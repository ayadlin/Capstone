BACKGROUND: The v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) inhibitor (BRAFi) drugs dabrafenib and vemurafenib
have high response rates in BRAF-mutant, metastatic melanoma; however, 50% of patients progress by 7 months. In this study, the
authors examined the nature and management of disease progression (PD) on BRAFi treatment, including characteristics and outcomes of patients who received continued BRAFi treatment beyond disease progression (TBP). METHODS: Clinicopathologic data at
baseline and at the time of PD were collected for all patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma who received BRAFi monotherapy within clinical trials between July 2009 and September 2012. Management and survival after PD were examined, including
continued BRAFi TBP (>28 days beyond Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor [RECIST]-defined PD). RESULTS: Ninety-five of
114 BRAFi-treated patients had PD. Fifty-three of those 95 patients (56%) progressed in extracranial sites alone, 18% (17 of 95
patients) progressed in intracranial and extracranial sites simultaneously, and 16% (15 of 95 patients) progressed in intracranial sites
alone. Twenty-nine of the 95 patients (31%) who had PD progressed in a single site or organ, 48% (46 of 95 patients) progressed in
existing metastases only, and 18% (17 of 95 patients) had new metastases alone. At the time of PD, 35 of 95 patients (37%) received
no subsequent systemic treatment, 20% (19 of 95 patients) changed systemic treatments, and 39% (37 of 95 patients) continued
BRAFi TBP for a median of 97 days. BRAFi TBP and known prognostic factors (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status, lactate dehydrogenase, RECIST sum of the greatest dimensions of target lesions) were associated with overall survival (OS)
from the time of PD; however, in multivariable analysis, BRAFi TBP improved OS (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.270.93; P5.029). CONCLUSIONS: Most BRAFi-treated patients progressed in existing extracranial sites, and 31% progressed in isolated
sites. Compared with cessation, continued BRAFi TBP is associated with prolonged OS even after adjusting for potential prognostic

This study demonstrates that, in patients who receive treatment with BRAF inhibitors for metastatic melanoma, one-third progress at isolated tumor sites, most
progress at existing extracranial sites, and intracranial progression alone is uncommon. The BRAF inhibitors dabrafenib and vemurafenib are associated with an
overall survival benefit when continued beyond disease progression even after adjusting for potential prognostic factors at progression.

position 600 (V600) of BRAF. Although the majority of
BRAFi-treated patients display initial tumor regression,
50% of patients progress by 7 months, and the median
overall survival (OS) is <2 years.3-6
Despite the emergence of drug resistance in the majority of patients, data are scarce regarding the nature and
management of patients after BRAFi disease progression.
Molecularly targeted drugs have demonstrated clinical
benefit when used beyond disease progression in other
solid tumors7-9; however, currently, there is conflicting
preclinical evidence regarding BRAFi treatment beyond
disease progression (treatment beyond progression
[TBP]). One study demonstrated decreased proliferation
with continued BRAFi treatment in melanoma cell lines
derived from a progressing melanoma metastasis because
of a BRAF splice variant10; however another study demonstrated tumor regression on vemurafenib withdrawal in
xenograft models of resistance because of BRAF amplification, which suggests that a discontinuous treatment strategy may be beneficial in these patients.11 Small studies
suggest that patients who receive BRAFi treatment may
progress in only some of their metastases; and, in those
patients, there may be a role for salvage local therapy to
these resistant metastases in isolated sites with continued
BRAFi treatment for the remaining drug-sensitive
disease.12,13
The objective of this study was to analyze the nature
and management of BRAFi disease progression in a large
cohort of patients. We examined the characteristics and
outcomes of patients who were receiving continued
BRAFi TBP compared with those who ceased treatment
upon disease progression to assess whether this approach
may be beneficial or harmful for selected patients with
melanoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection and Data Collection

The study was undertaken at Westmead Hospital
(WMH) and Melanoma Institute Australia (MIA) with
Human Research Ethics Committee approval and patient
informed consent. The study cohort included all patients
with BRAF-mutant, unresectable, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IIIC or IV melanoma
who were accrued consecutively to phase 1 through 4 clinical trials of single-agent dabrafenib5,14-16 or vemurafenib3,17-19 from July 2009 to September 2012 at
Westmead Hospital and Melanoma Institute Australia.

Tumors (RECIST)-defined (version 1.0 or 1.1)20,21 disCancer

ease progression were reviewed for the nature of disease
progression, subsequent treatments received, and survival
up to the time of data cutoff.
Prospectively collected clinical data included demographics, details of metastatic disease at trial commencement and at disease progression (including BRAF
mutation status, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] level, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance
status [PS], AJCC metastasis [M] classification, and
RECIST sum of diameters of target lesions [SoD]), the
nature of disease progression, and details of subsequent
treatments received. Radiology was retrospectively
reviewed only to determine the nature of disease progression, ie, existing versus new metastases, visceral (pulmonary, liver, pancreas, adrenal, or intra-abdominal) versus
nonvisceral (bone, subcutaneous, or lymph node) metastases, extracranial versus intracranial progression, isolated
versus generalized progression, and presence of brain metastases. Isolated disease progression was defined as progression in new or existing lesions within a single site/
organ while the remainder of disease was responding or
stable. Disease progression amenable to local treatment
was defined as the presence of extracranial metastases suitable for surgical excision or external-beam radiation therapy and intracranial metastases suitable for neurosurgery,
stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or whole-brain radiation
therapy (WBRT). BRAFi treatment response and outcome data were prospectively determined using RECIST
as part of the clinical trial in which the patient was enrolled. TBP was defined before data collection as the
receipt of BRAFi treatment >28 days beyond RECISTdefined disease progression, which was continued by the
trial investigator for assumed ongoing clinical benefit.
Factors predicted to influence a clinician’s decision when
deciding whether to consider BRAFi TBP included the
nature of progression (isolated/ generalized), the potential
to treat all progressive disease locally, the nature of clinical
response before progression (percentage response,
progression-free survival [PFS]), the disease burden at
progression (SoD), prognostic factors at progression
(ECOG PS, LDH level), and the availability and efficacy
of other standard therapies (eg, ipilimumab) or clinical
trials (eg, other mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK]
inhibitors, programmed cell death 1 [PD-1] antibodies)
at the time of progression.
Statistical Methods

Group comparisons were tested with the Pearson chisquare test, the Fisher exact test, or the Mann-Whitney U
test as appropriate. Survival analyses were carried out
3143

Original Article

using the Kaplan-Meier method together with the logrank (Mantel-Cox) test and the Cox proportional hazards
method. All factors that significantly influenced survival
on univariable analysis were entered into a multivariable
model using the backward conditional method. The software packages IBM SPSS Statistic version 21.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and SAS version 9.3 (SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) were used, and P values <.05
were considered statistically significant.
Univariable analysis of factors determined a priori
that had an influence on OS from disease progression
included age at disease progression, patient sex, BRAF
mutation status, ECOG PS at disease progression,
RECIST SoD at disease progression, type of disease progression, brain metastasis at disease progression, LDH
level at disease progression, local treatment of disease progression, BRAFi TBP, and alternative, subsequent systemic treatment.
Baseline PFS was measured from the date of BRAFi
commencement to disease progression according to
RECIST. OS was calculated both from the commencement of BRAFi treatment and from RECIST-defined disease progression. A sensitivity analysis was done with
BRAFi TBP defined as continued treatment beyond 0
days, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

In total, 114 patients with unresectable AJCC stage IIIC
or IV BRAF-mutant melanoma were enrolled on clinical
trials of dabrafenib (n569) or vemurafenib (n545). At
baseline, 94% of patients had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1,
43% had an elevated LDH level, and 28% had brain metastases. For the whole cohort (n5114), the objective
response rate was 68%, and the median PFS and OS was
5.5 months and 10.9 months, respectively.
At the time of analysis, 19 of 114 patients (17%)
had not progressed (Table 1); and, of these 19 patients,
74% had a normal LDH level at baseline, and 21%
achieved a complete response according to RECIST.
Patients who had not progressed had a median follow-up
of 26 months, were more likely to have no brain metastases at baseline compared with those who had progressed
(P5.013), and had a lower RECIST SoD (39 mm vs
94 mm; P<.011).

metastases only, whereas 17 of 95 patients (18%) progressed only because they developed new metastases. Overall, 29 of 95 patients (31%) progressed in a single site or
organ, 15 of 95 patients (16%) progressed in intracranial
sites alone, 17 of 95 (18%) progressed in both intracranial
and extracranial sites simultaneously, but the majority
(56%) progressed in extracranial sites alone. Nineteen of
95 patients (20%) had intracranial progression in existing
metastases, and 21 of 95 patients (22%) developed new intracranial metastases. Among the patients who had no
brain metastases at baseline, only 10 of 63 (16%) developed new brain metastases. Conversely, 19 of 31 patients
(61%) who had brain metastases at baseline had progression in existing brain metastases.

median duration of continued BRAFi TBP was 97 days
(range, 29-625 days). Of the 37 patients who continued
BRAFi TBP, 41% received subsequent systemic treatment
(Table 3), including trametinib, dabrafenib and trametinib, lenvatinib (E7080), ipilimumab, anti-PD1, or
LGX818 plus MEK162 (2 experimental drugs). Four
patients received multiple, subsequent, systemic therapies
after the cessation of BRAFi TBP. One patient stopped
vemurafenib and switched to dabrafenib after 26 days
because of severe skin toxicity. Twelve of 37 patients
(32%) who continued BRAFi TBP received local treatment to all known sites of disease progression. Twelve of
16 patients (75%) who received local treatment to all
known sites of disease progression received BRAFi TBP.

Local Treatment After BRAFi Disease
Progression

Factors Associated With BRAFi TBP

Of 70 patients who had extracranial disease progression,
20 (29%) received local treatment to progressing sites; 9
of those 20 patients (45%) underwent surgery alone, 10
of 20 (50%) received external-beam radiation therapy
alone, and 1 of 20 (5%) received both surgery and radiation therapy (Table 3). Of 32 patients who had intracranial disease progression, 21 (66%) received local
treatment to progressing sites; 3 of those 21 patients
(14%) underwent intracranial surgery alone, 4 of 21
(19%) underwent (SRS) alone, and 12 of 21 (57%)
received WBRT alone. One patient underwent SRS and
received WBRT, and another underwent intracranial surgery and received WBRT. Twenty-nine of 95 patients
(31%) had isolated progression in a single site or organ,
and 19 of those 29 patients (66%) had disease that was
considered amenable to local treatment, although only 13
of the 29 (45%) actually received it. Fifty-six of 95
patients (59%) had generalized progression, and 3 of
those 56 patients (5%) received local treatment to all
known sites of disease progression.
Systemic Treatment After BRAFi Disease
Progression

At the time of disease progression according to RECIST,
37 of 95 patients (39%) continued BRAFi TBP, 35 of 95
(37%) did not receive any subsequent systemic treatment,
and 19 of 95 (20%) switched to other drug treatments
(trametinib, dabrafenib plus trametinib, lenvatinib
[E7080], and/or ipilimumab), including 6 patients who
received multiple, subsequent systemic therapies (Table 3,
Figs. 1, 2).
Three patients who received TBP were still on
BRAFi at the date of data cutoff (November 2013). The
3146

Patients who received BRAFi TBP at the time of progression were more likely to have a lower ECOG PS
(P<.001), a normal LDH level (P5.003), a lower median
SoD (P5.002), isolated disease progression (P5.024),
and progression in existing brain lesions (P5.049) compared with those who did not receive BRAFi TBP (Table
2). Patients who received BRAFi TBP also had a longer
median PFS (6.9 months; 95% confidence interval [CI],
5.1-8.7 months) than the patients who did not receive
BRAFi TBP (3.8 months; 95% CI, 3.3-4.4 months;
P<.001). The receipt of BRAFi TBP increased over time;
only 9 of 41 patients (22%) received BRAFi TBP before
the midpoint of the study accrual period (April 2011)
compared with 28 of 54 patients (52%) after that time.
BRAFi TBP was not associated with the trial site, BRAF
mutation type, M-stage, patient sex, age at disease progression, or sites of disease progression (Table 2).
A higher proportion of patients who received BRAFi
TBP at the time of disease progression had disease that
was amenable to local treatment (P5.001) and received
local treatment (P5.002), particularly surgical resection
of extracranial disease progression (P5.004), compared
with those who did not receive BRAFi TBP (Table 3).
There was no difference in the use of local therapies for intracranial progression between patients who received
BRAFi TBP and those who did not (Table 3).
Prognostic Factors at the Time of BRAFi
Disease Progression

Several factors at the time of disease progression were associated with prolonged OS from progression in univariable
analysis; lower ECOG PS (P<.001), lower LDH
(P5.009), lower RECIST SoD (P<.001), isolated disease
progression (P5.019), and, surprisingly, the presence of

b
Isolated disease progression was defined as progression in new or existing lesions within a single site/organ with the remainder of disease responding or
stable.

Within the group of patients who received BRAFi
TBP, the following factors measured at progression influenced OS from the time of progression in univariable
analysis; lower RECIST SoD, brain metastases, lower
LDH and other subsequent systemic treatment (all
P<.05) (Table 5). In multivariable analysis, RECIST
SoD was the only factor associated with OS from the time
of disease progression (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.000-1.017;
P5.048).
Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine
whether the cutoff for the number of days of BRAFi TBP
used to define the TBP cohort (ie, in this study, >28
days) influenced the difference in OS from progression
observed for patients who received BRAFi TBP versus
those who did not receive BRAFi TBP. OS from disease
progression remained statistically different in univariable
analysis in the overall cohort of patients that progressed
when defined as >21 days (P<.001), >14 days
(P<.001), >7 days (P<.001), and >0 days (P5.018) after progression.
DISCUSSION
This study of a large, consecutively accrued, trial-eligible
cohort of patients with unresectable, AJCC stage IIIC or
IV melanoma systematically examines the clinical charac3148

teristics of disease progression and subsequent treatment
strategies, including the outcomes of continuing a BRAFi
beyond RECIST-defined disease progression. This study
was robust because it included data collected from
patients treated within clinical trials that had comprehensive follow-up data and prospectively scheduled RECIST
tumor assessments by the same radiologist. The overall
response rate of 68% for the whole cohort in this study
was higher than previously reported in other trials, but the
median PFS of 5.5 months and the median OS of 10.9
months were lower.4,6 This was likely because of the
inclusion of patients enrolled in trials that permit active
brain metastasis (n519), for which published median
PFS was 3.7 months, and the median OS was 6.5 to 7.4
months.16,18
The results of this study indicate that the nature of
BRAFi disease progression is heterogeneous, although the
majority of patients progress in extracranial sites and in
existing metastases. Intracranial progression alone (16%)
is uncommon and likely reflects the activity of BRAFi in
the brain.16,18 Few patients who receive BRAFi TBP develop new brain metastases, and the rate of progression in
existing brain metastases (61%) is concordant with the
overall rate of progression in existing lesions (71%). These
findings are in keeping with wider evidence of BRAFi

activity in the brain and confirm that intracranial and
extracranial disease control rates are similar.12,16 Many
BRAFi-treated patients remained suitable for consideration of postprogression treatment, because approximately
65% of patients in the current study had an ECOG PS of
0 or 1 at progression. Furthermore, nearly 31% of patients
had disease progression in isolated sites, for which surgery
or radiation therapy could be delivered and BRAFi continued rather than switching the patient to alternative
treatments. In cases of more generalized progression, the
reported minimal efficacy of ipilimumab in retrospective
studies in patients with aggressive disease16,22 and the lack
of other available, effective standard therapies could mean
that clinicians and patients may opt for ongoing BRAFi
treatment as a palliative measure rather than cessation of
systemic therapy, particularly if clinical trials are not
available.
The continuation of BRAFi treatment beyond
RECIST disease progression in selected patients demonCancer

strated no evident detrimental effects and may provide
benefit, because patients in this study who received BRAFi
TBP had a longer OS from commencement of BRAFi
and from disease progression than those who did not
receive BRAFi TBP, even after adjusting for other prognostic variables at progression, such as isolated progression, SoD, presence of brain metastases, subsequent
systemic treatment, ECOG PS, and LDH level. Furthermore, the median duration of continued treatment with a
BRAFi from progression was >3 months, and the median
OS from progression was 11.6 months. This is longer
than that reported in patients who were considered well
enough to switch to immunotherapy with ipilimumab, of
whom 50% were unable to complete the 4 cycles of ipilimumab treatment, and the median OS from BRAFi progression was 5 months.22 Switching to an alternative
systemic treatment, such as other MAPK inhibitors or
immunotherapy, either at the time of BRAFi disease progression or after final cessation of BRAFi in those who

received BRAFi TBP, also influenced OS. Whether this
result was because of selection bias or drug efficacy is not
known.
Two studies that used a xenograft model suggested
that ongoing BRAFi TBP may be detrimental. In 1 study,
withdrawal of vemurafenib promoted the regression of
established vemurafenib-resistant melanomas in xenografts with the specific resistance mechanism of BRAF
amplification.11 Results from another study indicated
that xenograft-derived, BRAFi-resistant cell lines with
another common resistance mechanism, aberrant splicing
of BRAF, grew more efficiently in vitro and in vivo in the
presence of BRAFi compared with the absence of
BRAFi.23 These findings need to be validated in humans,
and it remains to be determined whether other mechanisms of BRAFi resistance24-26 confer a melanoma cell
survival benefit in the absence of drug. In contrast to those
xenograft data, a patient-derived cell line that expressed a
BRAF splice variant had a slower rate of proliferation in
the presence of BRAFi compared with cessation of drug,
and accelerated disease progression has been described in
3150

patients with acquired resistance to BRAFi who were
receiving TBP upon BRAFi withdrawal.10 We suggest
that some antiproliferative activity is maintained by continuing BRAF inhibition beyond disease progression,
which may be explained in part by ongoing sensitivity of a
subset of cancer cells at the time of RECIST progression
because of intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneity.
This is not addressed by the preclinical experiments in
which the effects of BRAFi TBP depend on the specific resistance mechanism operating in that xenograft or
patient-derived cell line model.10,11,23 Heterogeneity of
both tumor response and resistance to combination
MAPK inhibitors in melanoma is well described and is
observed clinically when every individual metastasis is
examined.25-30 In the current study, we have demonstrated that there is a meaningful, added clinical benefit in
continuing BRAF inhibition beyond RECIST disease
progression in a large group of patients.
The results presented are consistent with a report on
patients in the phase 1 vemurafenib study who received
TBP in conjunction with local therapies to control

isolated disease progression.13 Those patients were treated
for a median duration of 3.6 months beyond disease progression and had a median OS in excess of 15.5 months
from the initiation of vemurafenib treatment.13 In addition, there have been studies in other tumor types examining TBP with molecularly targeted therapies, including
trastuzumab in breast cancer, imatinib in gastrointestinal
stromal tumors, and erlotinib in nonsmall cell lung cancer, although each drug is associated with unique mechanisms of resistance.7,9
Although patients were selected for BRAFi TBP on
the basis of ongoing clinical benefit, and those who
received BRAFi TBP had more favorable prognostic factors at the time of BRAFi disease progression and had
more limited disease progression, several factors mitigate
against the OS benefit being entirely attributable to positive selection. This analysis was necessarily retrospective,
because randomized discontinuation trials of BRAFi cannot be conducted in the presence of multiple other active
treatment options that have since become available.31-34
To minimize bias, we conducted a multivariable analysis,
which provided evidence that BRAFi TBP influences OS

from progression, and a sensitivity analysis, which demonstrated that the exclusion of patients who may have intentionally received BRAFi TBP but who deteriorated in
<28 days did not affect the results. The OS benefit of
BRAFi TBP persisted whether BRAFi was continued for
>0 days, 14 days, or 21 days after progression and
although the BRAFi TBP group had a higher proportion
of patients with brain metastases at progression (54% vs
36%).
These results contain potentially important messages
for future clinical trial design in metastatic melanoma.
The true benefit of BRAFi TBP requires a randomized
discontinuation study, but this is not feasible on practical
or ethical grounds. Novel therapies given after BRAFi
progression may be best explored by adding to the BRAFi
backbone rather than replacing it. Reduced mandatory
“washout” periods for cessation of MAPK inhibitors
should be revised in considering eligibility criteria for new
drugs, because long periods off BRAFi may be detrimental, and the half-life of these agents generally is quite short.
Continued BRAFi TBP may be safely considered at clinicians’ discretion in patients who have RECIST-defined
disease progression if no suitable alternative systemic
treatment options are available.
