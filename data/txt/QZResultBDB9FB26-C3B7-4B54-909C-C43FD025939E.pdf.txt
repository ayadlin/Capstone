Abstract
MUC16 is a well-validated cell surface marker for serous
adenocarcinomas of the ovary and other gynecologic malignancies that is distinguished by highly repetitive sequences
(‘‘mucin repeats’’) in the extracellular domain (ECD). We
produced and compared two monoclonal antibodies: one
(11D10) recognizing a unique, nonrepeating epitope in the
ECD and another (3A5) that recognizes the repeats and binds
multiple sites on each MUC16 protein. 3A5 conjugated to
cytotoxic drugs exhibited superior toxicity against tumor cells
in vitro and in tumor xenograft models compared with
antibody-drug conjugates of 11D10. Importantly, drug conjugates of 3A5 were well tolerated in primates at levels in
excess of therapeutic doses. Additionally, the presence of
circulating CA125 in a rat model did not exacerbate the
toxicity of 3A5 drug conjugates. We conclude that targeting
the repeat MUC16 domains, thereby increasing cell-associated
levels of drug-conjugated antibody, provides superior efficacy
in vitro and in vivo without compromising safety. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Epithelial ovarian adenocarcinomas constitute the largest class
of gynecologic malignancies in the United States in terms of
incidence and mortality and are the fifth leading cause of cancer
deaths among women nationwide (1). In the 1980s, a serum
antigen, CA125, was identified as a marker of these cancers, being
elevated most notably in serous adenocarcinomas (2–4). Presently,
CA125 has wide use as a marker for disease progression and
response to therapy. Despite the long-standing importance of
CA125 in the management of ovarian cancers, the gene encoding
this antigen has only recently been described. CA125 is the
extracellular domain (ECD) of a cell surface protein, MUC16, a
member of the mucin family (5, 6). MUC16 has a single
transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain. The
ECD is predicted to comprise more than 14,000 residues. The most
distinctive feature of the MUC16 ECD is tandem repeats of 156
amino acids each, referred to as mucin domains. Multiple proposed

sequences have been reported; depending on the submitted
sequence, there are at least 12 such repeats and possibly 60
repeats in tandem.
CA125 apparently enters the circulation by being shed from the
full-length MUC16 at the cell surface. Antibodies against CA125
selectively bind ovarian carcinomas versus normal tissues, with
expression levels the highest in serous adenocarcinomas (4).7
Immunohistochemistry and in vitro studies show surface expression of MUC16, a property that makes MUC16 an ovarian cancer
target for antibody therapeutics, and indeed several such
approaches have been explored (7).
Therapeutic antibodies that inhibit the proliferation of cancer
cells on binding to surface antigens are used in the treatment of
several malignancies (8). However, the targets for these antibodies
are generally known to be critical for the progression of the disease,
such that disrupting their functions would have a therapeutic
effect. The role of MUC16 and/or CA125 in ovarian cancer pathogenesis is unknown nor does the antigen has a well-established
physiologic function. If MUC16 expression is not crucial for ovarian
cancer genesis or progression, an unmodified antibody against
MUC16 may have little effect on the disease on binding to the
cancer cells, although some therapeutic benefit has been attributed
to antibodies binding to circulating CA125 and eliciting an immune
response (9, 10).
An alternative antibody-based therapeutic approach involves
conjugating cytotoxic drugs to antibodies such that the drug is
stably associated with the antibody in circulation but is released
when the antibody binds to the antigen-expressing tumor cell and
is internalized and transported to lysosomes. This so-called ‘‘armed
antibody’’ or ‘‘antibody-drug conjugate’’ (ADC) approach combines
the powerful antiproliferative activities of chemotherapeutic small
molecules with the targeting capabilities of antibodies (11–13).
Importantly, disruption of antigen function is not required for
activity; the target antigen need only be expressed at the plasma
membrane and be internalized by the tumor cells. However, this
technology may be limited by the inefficient delivery of the
cytotoxic drug to its intracellular target, relative to systemic
administration of the free drug. The number of antibody binding
sites per cell and the rate of antigen internalization will dictate the
amount of drug that can be delivered; an antibody that binds to
multiple epitopes per target antigen would deliver more drug and
possibly exhibit greater efficacy than an antibody that binds to a
unique epitope on the target antigen. To test this hypothesis, we
compared two monoclonal antibodies (mAb): one (11D10) binding

to a unique site on MUC16 and the other (3A5) binding to mucin
repeats (therefore binding more sites per cancer cell than 11D10)
and able to bind more avidly to CA125 (therefore subject to
potential liabilities from binding to CA125 in circulation). We
report here that 3A5 has superior in vivo and in vitro efficacy with
no apparent deleterious effects from CA125 binding. We argue that
the number of binding sites per cell can be a major determinant of
the utility of armed antibodies.

Materials and Methods
Cloning. A MUC16 sequence comprising bases 41,587 to 43,816 at the 3¶
end of NM_024690 and a sequence comprising several tandem mucin
repeats (bases 38,551–40,607) were cloned separately from a pool of
oligo(dT) primed human cDNA libraries (14). To generate MUC16TMshort,
the 3¶ clone was ligated into pRKtkneo encoding an NH2-terminal herpes
simplex virus glycoprotein D epitope tag and a COOH-terminal FLAG tag,
incorporating a NotI restriction site between the glycoprotein D and the
MUC16 sequences. To generate the longer sequence (‘‘MUC16TMlong’’), the
mucin repeats were ligated with MUC16TMshort using the NotI restriction
site following the glycoprotein D epitope tag. For expression of soluble
MUC16 ECD protein in baculovirus (‘‘MUC16ECDshort’’), bases 41,632 to
43,548 were inserted within a modified pVL1393 vector (BD PharMingen)
between a cleavable signal sequence and a COOH-terminal 8xHis tag.
mAb production. BALB/c mice were immunized with either
MUC16ECDshort (murine 11D10 or ‘‘mu11D10’’) or commercially available
purified CA125 (USBiological; murine 3A5 or ‘‘mu3A5’’) resuspended in
monophosphoryl lipid A/trehalose dicorynomycolate adjuvant (Ribi Immunochemicals). Three days after the final boost, popliteal lymph node cells
were fused with cells derived from the murine myeloma cell line
P3X63AgU.1 (CRL1597; American Type Culture Collection) using 50%
polyethylene glycol. Hybridomas were selected using hypoxanthineaminopterin-thymidine (HAT) medium (3A5 panel) or in methylcellulosebased HAT medium (11D10 panel; ClonaCell Medium D, Stemcell
Technologies) in 96-well plates. Ten to 14 days later, culture supernatants
were collected and screened by direct ELISA against the immunogen.
Positive cell lines were further screened by flow cytometric analysis for
binding to MUC16ECDshort on transfected cell lines (mu11D10) or fulllength MUC16 expressed on OVCAR-3 cells (mu3A5) and then subcloned by
limiting dilution.
Molecular cloning and reformatting of 3A5 and 11D10. Total RNA
was extracted from hybridoma cells producing mu3A5 or mu11D10 using
RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Inc.). The variable light and variable heavy
domains were amplified using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The
forward primers were specific for the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of
the variable light and variable heavy region. Respectively, the light chain and
heavy chain reverse primers were designed to anneal to regions in the
constant light and constant heavy domain 1 that are highly conserved
across species. Amplified variable light was cloned into a mammalian
expression vector containing the human n constant domain. Amplified
variable heavy was inserted to a mammalian expression vector encoding the
full-length human IgG1 constant domain. The chimeric antibodies (‘‘ch3A5’’
and ‘‘ch11D10’’) were transiently expressed as described (15).
Cells and antibodies. All cell lines were from the American Type Culture
Collection and grown in the recommended medium unless otherwise
indicated. OVCAR-3/luc cells were generated by stable transduction with a
construct encoding firefly luciferase using retroviral transfer according to
standard protocols. OVCAR-3/luc and PC3/MUC16 cells were maintained
under 500 Ag/mL G-418 selection. ADCs were made at Seattle Genetics, Inc.
All secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch.
Flow cytometry analysis. Cells for flow cytometry analysis were
resuspended with PBS + 5 mmol/L EDTA and washed with buffer consisting
of PBS with 1% fetal bovine serum and 1 mmol/L EDTA. All subsequent
steps were carried out at 4jC. Incubations of 5  105 cells were for 1 h each
with 5 Ag/mL primary antibody followed by the appropriate phycoerythrin
(PE)-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were then analyzed with a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).

Inhibition of in vitro proliferation. Proliferation in the presence of
armed antibodies was assessed using cells plated at 2,000 per well in 50 AL
of normal growth medium in 96-well clear-bottom plates. Twenty-four
hours later, an additional 50 AL of culture medium with serial dilutions of
armed antibodies were added to triplicate wells. Three (PC3) or 5
(OVCAR-3) days later, cell numbers were determined using CellTiter-Glo
II (Promega Corp.) and with an EnVision 2101 Mutilabel Reader (PerkinElmer). To detect selective inhibition of in vitro proliferation (Fig. 4C),
3  105 OVCA-432 cells were plated on each of three 100-mm dishes.
Twenty-four hours later, cells received fresh medium containing 100 ng/mL
antibodies in a total volume of 15 mL. Five days later, cells were
resuspended and stained with mu11D10 and PE-conjugated goat
anti-mouse secondary antibodies for flow cytometric analysis.
ELISA to estimate stoichiometry. Immunosorbant plates (Nunc
Intermed) were coated with 2 Ag/mL of mu3A5 or mu11D10 in PBS for
1 h and blocked with Casein Blocker (Pierce Biotechnology) for 2 h. CA125
was diluted 183-fold with ELISA buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05%
Tween 20 in PBS), and 100 AL/well (f500 units/well) were added for 1 h at
room temperature. Plates were washed with ELISA buffer, and serially
diluted ch3A5, ch11D10, or a chimeric control IgG were added to wells
containing either mu3A5- or mu11D10-captured CA125 for 1 h. Plates were
washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and the relative amount of
bound chimeric antibody was determined with anti-human Fc horseradish
peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and TMB Peroxidase Substrate
(KPL, Inc.).
Determination of antibody binding sites per cell (Scatchard
analysis). The affinity constant and the number of cell surface binding
sites for each antibody were estimated by incubating OVCAR-3 cells for
4 h on ice with a fixed concentration of 125I-labeled antibody combined with
increasing concentrations of unlabeled antibody (16). The data were
analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting using the New Ligand program, an inhouse analysis method based on Ligand (17).
In vivo efficacy. Efficacy studies were done using female CB17 ICR
severe combined immunodeficient mice (Charles River Laboratories). All
studies were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals (18).
To evaluate efficacy against i.p. tumors, mice were inoculated i.p. with
OVCAR-3/luc cells (20 million cells per mouse). Bioluminescence was
measured by injection with D-luciferin at 250 mg/kg (Molecular Probes)
and detection with an ultrasensitive cooled intensified charge-coupled
device camera. Mice with similar bioluminescence signals 2 weeks after
cell inoculation were separated into six groups of 10 mice each and dosed
with antibodies on days 0, 7, 14, and 21. Mice were weighed throughout the experiment and monitored closely for signs of distress (including
a distended abdomen, pale skin, and lethargy). If signs of distress or a
loss of body weight >20% of original weight were observed, the mice
were euthanized. Survival statistics were generated using JMP software
version 6.0.
The OVCAR-3 mammary fat pad transplant model was developed using
tumors excised from a mouse bearing an i.p. tumor and then serially
passaged into the mammary fat pads of recipient mice. When tumors
reached a volume of approximately 150 to 200 mm3, mice were separated
into five groups of 10 and dosed as described. Tumor volume was measured
using calipers according to the following formula: V (mm3) = 0.5A  B 2,
where A and B are the long and short diameters, respectively. Mice were
euthanized before tumor volume reached 3,000 mm3 or when tumors
showed signs of impending ulceration. Data collected from each
experimental group were expressed as mean F SE.
The PC3/MUC16TMlong efficacy model studies were done with s.c.
injection of 10 million cells into the right dorsal flank. When tumors
reached a volume of 100 to 200 mm3, mice were distributed into groups and
dosed as described in Results.
Nude rat OVCAR-3 toxicity model. All experimental procedures were
done at Oncodesign (Dijon, France). NIH:OVCAR-3 ascitic tumors were
serially transplanted in three steps into the peritoneal cavities of nude rats
after whole body g irradiation. Serum CA125 was determined using a
standard ELISA assay. One hundred tumor-bearing nude rats were

randomized into five groups of 10 rats according to body weight and CA125
level (range, 16–2,290 units/mL). Twenty healthy nude rats were
randomized in four groups of 5 rats according to body weight; these rats
had no detectable circulating CA125. Rats received vehicle, drug-conjugated
3A5, or control ADC on treatment day 0. Blood sampling was done
immediately before and 5 and 12 days after dosing.

Results
MUC16 is a type I transmembrane cell surface protein comprising between 12 (Genbank accession no. NM_024690) and 60
(Genbank accession no. AF414442) extracellular mucin repeats, in
addition to nonrepeating sequence. The NM_024690 sequence is
used as the reference for clones and constructs described below.
Two approaches were taken to generate mouse mAbs against the
ECD of MUC16. First, mice were immunized with a sequence
encoding the juxtamembrane portion of MUC16 from the end of
the major mucin repeats to the transmembrane domain
(MUC16ECDshort; Supplementary Fig. S1). Among a panel of
mAb, 11D10 exhibited the highest affinity for the antigenic protein.
This antibody recognized a truncated form of MUC16 ectopically
expressed in PC3 cells (‘‘MUC16TMshort’’; Supplementary Fig. S1)
but did not bind to cells lacking detectable MUC16 expression
(Fig. 1A). 11D10 also binds to OVCAR-3 cells, a cell line that
expresses high levels of cell surface MUC16 (Fig. 1C). By

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

mutagenesis, we defined the 11D10 epitope within an 82-amino
acid sequence C-terminal to the mucin repeat domain (data not
shown).
The second panel of mouse mAbs was generated using purified
CA125 from a commercial source as the immunogen to obtain
antibodies recognizing the mucin repeats. Among this panel, mu3A5
was superior in terms of binding affinity and specificity for MUC16.
This antibody interacted only weakly with the truncated MUC16 that
was recognized by the first panel of antibodies. Insertion of five

conferred 3A5 binding (Fig. 1A). When tested for binding to cells
stably expressing MUC16TMlong, 11D10 and 3A5 both gave flow
cytometry shifts comparable with an antibody against the
glycoprotein D epitope tag (Fig. 1A; data not shown). It is likely
that both 3A5 and 11D10 bind once per copy of MUC16TMlong
protein. Specificity of 3A5 for MUC16 was also shown by reduced
binding to OVCAR-3 cells treated with small interfering RNA
oligonucleotides targeting MUC16 message (data not shown).
Assembly of the MUC16TMlong sequence introduced a nonMUC16 sequence (encoding [-SHLFGTLGGR-]) between the
repeats and the MUC16TMshort sequence. Subsequent to these
studies, a construct encoding a continuous MUC16 sequence
(amino acids 13,340–14,507 of NP_078996.2 encoded by
NM_024690) was analyzed for 3A5 and 11D10 binding, yielding
essentially identical results to those obtained with MUC16TMlong
(data not shown).

MUC16TMlong encodes only a portion of the predicted fulllength MUC16 sequence, particularly lacking the majority of the
repeats (but including all of the unique COOH-terminal sequence).
3A5 binds much more extensively than does 11D10 to ovarian
cancer cells that express the full-length MUC16 (Fig. 1A; data not
shown). Scatchard analysis confirms that 3A5 binds to >3-fold
more sites per OVCAR-3 cell than does 11D10, albeit with a lower
apparent affinity (Table 1). K d values in Table 1 are consistent with
K d values determined using a soluble substrate (data not shown).
To determine if 3A5 recognizes multiple sites on MUC16, purified
CA125 was captured onto plates coated with mu3A5 or mu11D10,
and then the captured CA125 was interrogated with ch3A5,
ch11D10, or an irrelevant antibody (‘‘control’’). Ch3A5 recognized
CA125 immobilized by either mu3A5 or mu11D10, but ch11D10
only recognized CA125 immobilized by mu3A5 (Fig. 1B). Above
1 nmol/L, ch3A5 binding is f8-fold greater than ch11D10 binding

to CA125 immobilized by mu3A5, consistent with the Scatchard
binding data on OVCAR-3 cells. This result shows that 3A5 binds to
multiple epitopes on CA125 (therefore on MUC16), whereas 11D10
recognizes a unique epitope. Preliminary analyses have identified a
sequence that is critical for 3A5 binding and is well conserved

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

among the repeats and in mouse, rat, and primate MUC16 (data
not shown).
Importantly, 11D10 and 3A5 both are specific for MUC16 and
stain only cell lines, tumors, and normal tissues known to express
significant levels of MUC16. Consistent with the stoichiometric
data, 3A5 stains a higher proportion of human ovarian tumors and
with greater intensity than 11D10 by immunohistochemistry (data
not shown); for both antibodies, staining is membranous and is
most prominent in serous adenocarcinomas, in agreement with
published reports.
To evaluate if 11D10 and 3A5 antibodies could be used
therapeutically, in vitro and in vivo studies were done using OVCAR3 cells (19, 20). MUC16 expression in OVCAR-3 cells is typical of the
expression in serous adenocarcinomas based on microarray, quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and immunohistochemical analyses (data
not shown). The proliferation of OVCAR-3 cells in vitro and colony
formation in soft agar are not sensitive to any unmodified anti-MUC16
antibodies among the 16 Genentech and commercial antibodies
tested. To explore the drug-targeting potential of anti-MUC16
antibodies, 3A5 and 11D10 were conjugated to the auristatins
monomethylauristatin F (MMAF) through a maleimidocaproyl (MC)
linker (yielding Ab-MC-MMAF) and monomethylauristatin E (MMAE)
through a cathepsin B-labile MC-[valine-citrulline]-para-amino-benzoate (‘‘MC-VC-PAB’’) linker (yielding Ab-MC-VC-PAB-MMAE, abbreviated ‘‘Ab-VC-MMAE’’; refs. 21, 22). These drug-conjugated antibodies
are designed to carry the cytotoxic payload in an inactive form until
the antibody binds the target antigen at the cell surface, is internalized,
and enters a degradative compartment, such as lysosomes, where
active drug is released (23).
Proliferation of OVCAR-3 cells in vitro over 5 days was much
more strongly inhibited by each 3A5-auristatin conjugate
compared with the 11D10 conjugates (Fig. 2A). Irrelevant
antibody conjugates were inactive against OVCAR-3 cells under
these conditions (data not shown). The greater potency of the
3A5 drug conjugates is not due to a higher rate of transport to
lysosomes, as 11D10 is internalized and delivered to lysosomes at
least as efficiently as is 3A5 (data not shown), nor does 3A5 have
a higher affinity for the target (Table 1). Rather, the greater
activity of 3A5 conjugates is probably due to increased ADC
binding per cell, resulting in increased overall delivery of drug
into the cell. Indeed, 11D10 conjugates show slightly stronger
activity versus 3A5 conjugates when added to the PC3/
MUC16TMlong cells that bind the two antibodies to a similar
degree (Fig. 2B).
OVCA-432 (2) is a serous cystadenocarcinoma line that expresses
MUC16, although less than OVCAR-3 (Fig. 3A). Additionally, the
rates of internalization of 3A5 into these cells are comparable, with
lysosomal staining apparent only after prolonged incubations (data
not shown). Although the proliferation of OVCAR-3 cells is almost
completely inhibited by 3A5-VC-MMAE in vitro (Fig. 3B) above
100 ng/mL, OVCA-432 proliferation was incompletely inhibited
even at the highest concentrations tested. When OVCA-432 in a
Petri dish was incubated with 100 ng/mL 3A5-VC-MMAE over
5 days, only f50% of cells survived compared with untreated cells
and cells incubated with an irrelevant MMAE conjugate (data not
shown). The surviving OVCA-432 cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry with 11D10, revealing a selection for lower MUC16
expression (Fig. 3C). No selection for MUC16 expression was
observed using the irrelevant conjugate (Fig. 3C) or unconjugated
3A5 (data not shown) nor with free MMAE at the approximate IC50
dose (data not shown). This result indicates that ADCs can be

selective for cells expressing high surface levels of target antigen
in vitro, sparing ‘‘neighboring’’ cells with lower or no antigen
expression, and further underscores the role of antigen expression
level in determining the activity of an ADC. Although in principle
the MMAE released within higher expressing cells could diffuse
into and kill the lower expressing cells, the absolute amount of free
MMAE generated in this setting is presumably insufficient to
produce an extensive ‘‘bystander’’ effect (24).
To determine if the superior in vitro potency of 3A5 drug
conjugates versus 11D10 conjugates would be retained in vivo, we
compared their efficacies in rodent tumor models. OVCAR-3 cells
inoculated into the peritonea of nude mice exhibit certain features
in common with the human malignancy (20, 25). The cells
proliferate within the peritoneum, form ascites, establish solid
lesions on the peritoneal wall, and over time metastasize to the
lung, liver, and heart (data not shown). Serum CA125 becomes
elevated somewhat before the detection of metastases. Such an
‘‘OVCAR-3 i.p.’’ model would be an appropriate setting for testing
anti-MUC16 ADCs. However, tumor burden is not easily measured
in the peritoneum. To allow for measurement of tumor burden over
time, OVCAR-3 cells were stably transduced with firefly luciferase
(‘‘OVCAR-3/luc’’) so that bioluminescence on luciferin injection
could be used as a surrogate reporter. Mice bearing OVCAR-3/luc
tumors were dosed with 3A5 or 11D10 drug conjugates at a point
when tumors were established and stable in the peritoneum, but
metastases and overt signs of disease were absent. In preliminary
studies, CA125 was markedly elevated in the peritoneum (>1,000
units/mL) and moderately elevated in the general circulation (<100
units/mL) at that stage. Both drug conjugate formats of 3A5
produced a reduction of bioluminescence (Fig. 4A) and a
commensurate improvement in survival (Fig. 4B); the response as
measured by bioluminescence correlated with life span. Two of the
seven mice in the 3A5-VC-MMAE group had no bioluminescence

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

at study termination and seemed to be free of tumor cells. In
contrast, between the 11D10 conjugates administered at comparable doses, only the VC-MMAE format exhibited efficacy, producing a
transient reduction in bioluminescence and a statistically significant survival benefit. A log-rank test showed significantly improved
survival of 3A5 conjugates versus the corresponding 11D10
conjugates (P = 0.002 for VC-MMAE; P = 0.023 for MC-MMAF).
This study establishes drug conjugates of the repeat-binding 3A5 as
more potent than the 11D10 antibody that binds to a unique site on
MUC16. Conjugates of 3A5 are also better tolerated in normal
Sprague-Dawley rats (data not shown).
The OVCAR-3/luc i.p. model showed superior efficacy of 3A5-VCMMAE compared with 3A5-MC-MMAF. To compare the relative
efficacies of the two 3A5 drug conjugates in other models, we
tested the conjugates in topical mouse xenograft models using the
PC3/MUC16TMlong and OVCAR-3 cell lines. With weekly dosing at
comparable drug exposure levels, 3A5-VC-MMAE most potently
inhibited the growth of s.c. PC3/MUC16TMlong tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2A), achieving 100% complete responses at 3.73 mg/kg
(220 Ag/m2 drug). At 3.48 mg/kg (224 Ag/m2 drug), 3A5-MC-MMAF
had only a modest inhibitory effect on tumor growth. Using the
PC3/MUC16TMlong s.c. model (Supplementary Fig. S2B) and
OVCAR-3 tumors grown in the mammary fat pads (Fig. 4C), similar
efficacies were achieved with weekly dosing at 2 mg/kg 3A5-VCMMAE (40.6 Ag/kg drug = 118 Ag/m2 drug exposure) and 6 mg/kg
3A5-MC-MMAF (133 Ag/kg drug = 388 Ag/m2 drug exposure). This
result shows that appropriate dosing with 3A5 ADC can achieve
eradication of xenograft tumors. Compared with vehicle-treated
tumors, MUC16 expression seems to be unchanged by ADC doses
that achieved partial tumor inhibition or in tumors that have
returned after cessation of dosing, indicating that the drugconjugated antibodies do not select against MUC16 expression in
these models (data not shown).

Armed Anti-MUC16 Antibodies Are Efficacious

Preliminary safety assessments in Sprague-Dawley rats and
cynomolgus monkeys showed that 3A5-MC-MMAF is better
tolerated than 3A5-VC-MMAE. Of note, immunohistochemistry
with 3A5 showed that the expression of MUC16 in normal tissues
of cynomolgus monkeys is quite comparable with the normal
human tissue expression, with antigen detected in bronchus and
fallopian tube. However, toxicity due to damage to these organs by
either 3A5 drug conjugate was not observed on histopathologic
examination and was not suggested by changes in hematology or
serum chemistry variables. The safety findings in primates were
not confounded by any detectable host immune response to the
3A5 drug conjugates. In both species, the most significant toxicity
was transient neutropenia produced by supraefficacious doses of
3A5-VC-MMAE (6.2 mg/kg = 95.9 Ag/kg = 1,100 Ag/m2; Supplementary Fig. S3; data not shown). The neutropenia is likely a
target-independent toxicity, as MUC16 is not expressed on
granulocytes.
The normal rat and monkey models do not present circulating
CA125 as would be the case in ovarian cancer patients. An
antibody such as 3A5 that binds to repetitive epitopes of a
circulating antigen might be distributed and metabolized
differently than an antibody that remains unbound in circulation.
In the case of an armed antibody, this could in principle yield
increased toxicity specifically in major organs of clearance, such
as the liver. To evaluate the safety effect of drug-conjugated
3A5 binding to circulating CA125, nude rats harboring serum
CA125 (range, 16–2,290 units/mL; median, 57 units/mL) due to
peritoneal OVCAR-3 tumors were dosed with 3A5-VC-MMAE at
two dose levels (685 and 2,056 Ag/m2 drug exposure) or with an
irrelevant Ab-VC-MMAE conjugate (2,056 Ag/m2 drug exposure).
Rats were evaluated for changes in body weight, hematology, and
blood chemistry; data showing leukopenia (Fig. 5A), elevation of
liver enzymes in the serum (Fig. 5B), and thrombocytopenia
(Fig. 5C) are shown. The toxicity due to the higher dose of
3A5-VC-MMAE did not seem to be related to the circulating
CA125, as the control conjugate (not binding to CA125) was at
least as toxic. In addition, the rats tolerated the lower dose of
3A5-VC-MMAE, which would remain in excess of CA125 and form
as much immune complex as the higher dose (data not shown).
Histopathologic examination failed to reveal any lesions that
could be attributed to 3A5-VC-MMAE exposure in CA125-positive
rats (data not shown). This result suggests that toxicity from
circulating 3A5-CA125 complexes will not be limiting for armed
3A5 therapy. The selection of the VC-MMAE or MC-MMAF
format for further study will hinge on more precise determinations of relative safety and efficacy.

Discussion
Armed antibodies have great promise as cancer therapeutics by
delivering a cytotoxic payload specifically to the tumor cells that
overexpress target antigens at the cell surface (11). In principle, the
level of cytotoxic drug delivered to its molecular target (e.g.,
microtubules for auristatins) inside the tumor cell is a function of
the flux of antibody into the cell per unit time, which in turn is
determined by antigen copy number and rate of turnover. For most
targets, this mechanism of drug delivery will likely be much less
efficient than systemic delivery of the free cytotoxic drug, although
more specific for the tumor cells (and so presumably safer). To
achieve sufficiently high levels of cytotoxic drug inside the tumor

cells, either the target antigen should be rapidly turned over or the
absolute level of surface antibody binding sites should be high.
MUC16 is a slowly internalizing cell surface protein that is
expressed in a large proportion of ovarian cancers more strongly
than in any normal human tissues. The absolute levels of MUC16
expression on relevant cell lines, such as OVCAR-3, are rather
modest, possibly compromising the efficacy of anti-MUC16 ADC.
Indeed, when we evaluated mAb 11D10 against a unique epitope of
MUC16, the drug-conjugated antibody exhibited only partial
activity against OVCAR-3 cells in vitro and in OVCAR-3 xenograft
models. To increase cytotoxic drug delivery, we developed mAb 3A5
against the mucin repeats of MUC16, allowing multiple antibody
binding per MUC16 molecule. Flow cytometry and Scatchard
binding analyses showed increased binding of 3A5 to OVCAR-3
cells versus 11D10, a property also reflected in the superior staining
of ovarian cancer tissues by 3A5.
As predicted from binding studies, armed 3A5 was much more
potent than armed 11D10 in vitro and in vivo. Significantly, in a
model expressing endogenous MUC16 and generating CA125,
armed 3A5 achieved partial and, in some cases, complete responses
conferring a marked survival advantage to the 3A5 treatment
groups versus 11D10 groups and controls. Both 3A5 drug conjugates produce antitumor activity at doses that are well tolerated by rats and nonhuman primates, with transient neutropenia
after exposure to 3A5-VC-MMAE being the primary toxicity. 3A5VC-MMAE has been more efficacious than 3A5-MC-MMAF in
multiple xenograft tumor models, whereas 3A5-MC-MMAF is better
tolerated. 3A5 drug conjugates have exhibited excellent activity
with dosing every 3 weeks (data not shown), indicating that these
conjugates can be dosed with a schedule that achieves efficacy
while allowing recovery from neutropenia. In our in vivo models,
we have not observed any toxicities that could be attributed to
armed 3A5 binding to circulating CA125. In addition, a phase I trial
evaluating drug-conjugated antibodies against MUC1 did not find
any correlation of toxicities with the levels of circulating MUC1
ECD (26).
Epithelial ovarian cancers are frequently diagnosed at a late
stage. Although most patients respond initially to chemotherapy
(commonly paclitaxel combined with a platinum drug), the
majority will relapse and experience diminishing responses to
therapy, with a poor prognosis. Treatment of this disease would
benefit greatly from a novel therapeutic modality. The impressive
efficacy of armed 3A5 in rodent tumor models, combined with the
selectivity of the antibody for MUC16 and its consequent relative
safety in rats and nonhuman primates, makes this strategy a
promising approach for the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancers.
The preclinical data suggest an encouraging therapeutic index, and
those patients who might benefit from armed 3A5 would be readily
identified by the presence of circulating CA125 and/or immunohistochemical detection of MUC16. We are presently extending
these studies to other models and evaluating the effects, if any, of
chemotherapeutic resistance.
