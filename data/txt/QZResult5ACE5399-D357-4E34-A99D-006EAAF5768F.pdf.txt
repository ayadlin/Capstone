ABSTRACT
Previous studies have indicated that stiehopus japonieus acidic
mucopolysaccharide (SJAMP) could inhibit the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell
SW1990. However, the mechanism remains unclear. In our study, YAP expression
was identified by immunohistochemistry and quantitative Real-time PCR from 45 pairs
of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissues and their adjacent nontumor samples. We found that the YAP expression was associated with the histological
differentiation degree, and negatively correlated with pancreatic cancer patients’
survival. More YAP localization in nuclear and enhanced expression of YAP mRNA in
pancreatic cancer tissue was found in comparison with in the normal tissue. These
results identify YAP acts as an amazing regulator in the pathogenesis of pancreatic
cancer. After affected by SJAMP, YAP and TEAD1 were down regulated, while MST1
and pYAP were upregulated gradually with the prolong of effect time. SJAMP also
improved YAP phosphorylation, nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation and inactivation.
After successfully knocked-down by YAP siRNA, the inhibition of proliferation
of SJAMP to cancer cells was attenuated. Interestingly, we indicated a downregulation of that TEAD with SJAMP 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml for 24 h and with 8 mg/ml
SJAMP for 24 h, 48 h even after YAP silencing. That might mean that the SJAMP
has other targets, not only YAP, to downregulate TEAD. We proposed a hypothesis
that Hippo-YAP pathway involved in carcinogenesis of pancreatic cancer and in the
inhibition effect of SJAMP to the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell, although
maybe not the sole signaling pathway.

INTRODUCTION

to elucidate the complex mechanism on the pancreatic
carcinogenesis and toward new therapeutic approaches.
Carcinogenesis results from an endless and
uncontrolled proliferation and growth advantage,
because of the DNA mutations and cellular malignant
transformation [5–7]. In recent decades, research has
characterized that several pathways highlight a pivotal
role in cancer progression, including Raf-MEK-ERK
signaling pathway, PI3K-PTEN-Akt-mTOR signaling
pathway, and the newly emerging Hippo-YAP pathway.
The ERK and Akt signaling pathways have been shown

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC)
is a kind of aggressive cancer, which 5-year survival rate
less than 5% [1]. In China from 2000 to 2011, PDAC
incidence and age-standardized mortality rates were
increased obviously [2]. Because of diagnosis in late
stage, only one third patients experienced curative-intent
operation, and less than 10% of patients had chance to
receive comprehensive treatment [3] and with very poor
prognosis [4]. Therefore, it would be of a great clinic value

Elevated YAP activity/expression strongly correlated with
tumor histological differentiation in pancreatic cancer
tissue (χ2 = 5.294, p = 0.048), however, YAP has no

suggest that YAP maybe participate in the tumorigenesis
of pancreatic cancer.

over the past 25 years to transfer signals which regulating
the proliferation and apoptosis.  The ERK pathway
controls cell proliferation, differentiation and metastasis
[8]. Phosphorylation of AKT also promotes tumorigenesis
through mediating cell apoptosis and proliferation [9].
The Hippo-YAP signaling pathway plays vital roles in
regulating cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, organ
size, and even cancer development. YAP is a downstream
target of core kinases of mammalian STE20-like protein
kinase 1/2 (MST1/2) and its downstream factor, large
tumor suppressor 1/2 (LATS1/2) [10]. When YAP enters
the nucleus, it promotes a number of downstream gene
transcriptions and exerts a pleiotropic role in tumor
growth and apoptosis inhibition [11]. Overexpression of
YAP was observed in differentiated cell associated with
epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and anchorageindependent proliferation [12]. Expressions of YAP
enhanced in a variety of human cancers, for example, lung
cancer [13], esophagus cancer [14], liver cancer [15] and
ovarian cancer [16]. YAP is able to induce ERK and AKT
phosphorylation [17, 18], and there are novel and complex
ERK/AKT/Hippo-YAP regulatory network in oncogenesis
and provides valuable indications for developing targeted
therapies [19].
Stiehopus japonieus acidic mucopolysaccharide
(SJAMP) is a kind of acid mucopolysaccharides extracted
from stiehopus japonieus, with the properties of anti-tumor
and immunomodulatory. We previous study showed that
SJAMP could inhibit pancreatic cancer cells growth,
promote apoptosis, and increase the percentage of G0/G1
stage [20]; however, the mechanism was unclear.
According to the results of our study, we define that YAP
plays a paramount role in the tumorgenesis of pancreatic
cancer and SJAMP could have theraputic effects through
the Hippo-YAP pathway.

Prognostic value of YAP in pancreatic cancer
patients
Pancreatic cancer has a character of fatal
malignancies and poor prognosis. We have known that the
high CA199 serum level usually mean poor prognosis and
recurrence of cancer [22, 23]. Our research results figured
out that the relative expression of YAP mRNA in cancer
tissues was 9.4 times compared to that in the normal
tissues (0.3685 ± 0.029 vs 0.03908 ± 0.0024, p < 0.001)
(Figure 1B). Importantly, patients with enhanced YAP
expression had a significantly higher CA19-9 serum
level compared to patients with low YAP expression
(r = 0.652, p = 0.0089). We also determined the role YAP
played in survival. The median overall survival (OS) was
7.0 ± 0.6 months (95% CI: 5.4–8.2 months), compared
with the patients who had high expression of YAP
(4.0 ± 0.6 months; 95% CI: 3.1–5.1 months; p = 0.015,
Figure 1C) by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The univariate
survival analysis indicated that low YAP expression and
receives chemotherapy treatment mean longer survival
time. (Table 2, p = 0.015 and p = 0.048) and had
independent prognostic value in the multivariate analysis
(Table 3, p = 0.048 and p = 0.033).

Hippo-YAP pathway involved in the inhibition of
proliferation of SW1990 induced by SJAMP

RESULTS
YAP levels are significantly higher in pancreatic
cancer tissues

The Hippo pathway plays a paramount role in the
progression as well as development of pancreatic cancer
[24]. The Hippo-YAP pathway is engaged in the cell
proliferation to limit organ size. In this process, Mst1/2
kinase is one of the pivotal Hippo kinase complexes, which
was activated at first and then phosphorylate the other
core component, as an example, Lats1/2 [25], and then
the later phosphorylates YAP/TAZ. YAP has two kinds of
existence forms, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.
Phosphorylation form of YAP, p-S127 YAP/14-3-3
complexes locates in the cytoplasm, binding with 14-3-3
proteins on Ser127 site [26, 27]. Dephosphorylation
form of YAP translocates into the nucleus without a
Hippo signal, and controls many transcription genes,
interacting with members of the TEA domain-containing
transcription factor family (TEAD) [7]. In our study, the
results of MTT analysis showed that the proliferation of

Previous studies have showed that YAP promoted
pancreatic cancer anchorage-independent growth and cell
proliferation. It was also an amazing regulator to pancreatic
cancer cells motility, infiltrate and distance metastasis
[21]. Our research data indicated YAP was overexpressed,
located in the nucleus, and hyperactivated in pancreatic
cancer tissues. Immunostaining demonstrated that YAP was
low expressed in normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cell
cytoplasm in adjacent non-tumor samples, partly expressed
in nucleus, without expression in pancreatic acini and
centroacinar cells. In pancreatic cancer tissues, YAP was
intensively localized in the nuclear of the ductal epithelial
cells (Figure 1A). In pancreatic cancer tissues, the positive
expression rate of YAP was 93.33%, while in normal

SJAMP improved the phosphorylation and
nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation of YAP and
its inactivation

SW1990 was markedly reduced with the increase of the
dose and the prolong of effect time of SJAMP. These
results demonstrated that SJAMP inhibited SW1990 cell
proliferation gradually with the increase of effect dose and
prolong of effect time. (p < 0.05, Figure 1D). We also found
that after successfully knocked-down by YAP siRNA,
this inhibition tendency to cancer cells was attenuated
(p < 0.05, Figure 1E). As shown in Figure 2A, we found
that with the prolong of effect time of 8 mg/ml SJAMP
on the pancreatic cancer cells, YAP, TEAD1, and Survivin
expression significantly decreased, but the levels of the
Hippo upstream gene, MST1, and Caspase-9 increased.
The same tendency was observed in different dose of
SJAMP (Figure 2B). Therefore, we speculated that HippoYAP signaling might participate in the process of SJAMP
inhibiting the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells.

After phosphorylated, YAP localized in the cytoplasm
and couldn’t shift into nuclear and lose the transcriptional
activity. After transferring into the nucleus, YAP promotes
the expression of the downstream transcription factor
DIAP1 and Cyclin E, and has transcriptional coactivator
activity toward TEAD/TEF and p73, promoting cell
proliferation [27]. In our experiments, we further confirmed
YAP and pYAP expression by western-blotting. After
affected by SJAMP, the YAP protein expression level
decreased and pYAP protein level increased significantly
(Figure 2C and 2D). The result of immunofluorescence
analysis also indicated that after effected by SJAMP, there is

And then we tested one of the YAP downstream target gene,
TEAD, affected by SJAMP for different dose and effect
time after knocked-down YAP. Interestingly, although our
previous study results indicated that SJAMP could decrease
the expression of TEAD, we found that after YAP silencing
there was still a decrease trend of TEAD, with SJAMP

differentiation in pancreatic cancer tissue. It showed that
the YAP played an important role in the occurrence and
development of pancreatic cancer. Cigarette smoking
is one of the risk factors [29]. The risk in obesity and
diabetes individuals also significantly elevated. New onset
diabetes mellitus may be the key clues to the diagnosis
in the pancreatic cancer early stage [30]. However, in our
study there were no obvious differences among age, sex,
smoking, drinking, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance,
diabetes, chronic pancreatitis and clinical stage. Our
research also indicated that YAP is negatively associated
with pancreatic cancer patient survival, which suggests
high probability of poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer
patients. A larger number of cases than that in the present
study are needed for further study.
CA19-9 is a kind of mucin glycoprotein components
which is recognized to be the tumor markers of pancreatic
cancer. There were some studies supported that the
level of CA19-9 was negatively correlated with survival
which was an important index to reflect prognosis and
recurrences [31]. Our study demonstrated that serum
CA19-9 levels in cancer patients had positively correlation
with YAP, and the staining intensity and extent of YAP
was much higher in primary cancer tissue than in normal
tissue. Low YAP expression and chemotherapy treatment
were positively correlated with the patients’ survival.
The high YAP expression in pancreatic cancer tissue and
poor differentiation degree were positively correlated to
poorer prognosis and had independent prognostic value in
the multivariate analysis. Thus, our results indicated that
YAP may be a potential prognostic factor and may be a
promising therapy target of pancreatic cancer.
SJAMP is an animal acid mucopolysaccharide
extracted by the Stiehopus cell wall, which has the important
roles of anticoagulant, anti-thrombosis, reducing blood fat
and viscosity, antitumor, immunomodulatory, antibacterial,
antiviral and promoting cell growth. Studies had shown that
SJAMP inhibited cervical cancer Hela cells proliferation
through inhibiting CyclinD1 and CDK4, and induce the
differentiation of Hela cells by suppressing the expression
of oncogene c-myc [32]. It inhibited the proliferation and
inducing apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell
line HepG2, and resisted the carcinoma by changing the
Bcl-2 and nm23-H1 protein expression [33].

DISCUSSION
As reported here, we found that YAP was obviously
increased in pancreatic cancer compared with the normal
pancreatic tissues. In cancer tissues, YAP was highly
located in the nuclear of pancreatic ductal epithelial cells.
Increased YAP activity/expression strongly correlated
with poor tumor histological differentiation. Furthermore,
patients with strong positive YAP expression had a higher
CA19-9 serum level compaired to patients with low YAP
expression. Low YAP expression and chemotherapy
treatment were positively correlated with survival and
had independent prognostic value in the multivariate
analysis. Our study is likely a consequence that SJAMP
improved the phosphorylation and nuclear-to-cytoplasmic
translocation of YAP to inhibit the cancer cell proliferation.
Therefore, YAP functioned as a tumor oncogene and
promoted pancreatic cancer progression. SJAMP inhibited
pancreatic cancer cells growth through Hippo-YAP signal
pathway and it could be a potential target for designing
effective therapeutic strategies.
Studies have found in the pancreatic embryonic
development, Hippo-YAP pathway participates in it and
helps to maintain the pancreatic acinar cell differentiation
[28]. Our data indicated that the staining intensity and
extent of YAP was markedly stronger when compared
with cancer tissues and normal tissues. Further analysis
of the correlation of YAP activity/expression with
clinicopathological parameters demonstrated that YAP
expression strongly correlated with tumor histological

The Hippo-YAP pathway, an evolutionarily
conserved pathway, plays elementary roles in tissues
growth and regeneration, as well as in cancer development
[34]. MST is an important factor of Hippo pathway
core kinase cascade chain, whose role is to inhibit the
key components of Hippo signaling pathway to inhibit
the tumor [35]. It modulates YAP phosphorylation and
nuclearcytoplasmic distribution [36]. While located in
the nucleus, YAP stimulates the downstream transcription
factor expression to influence cell proliferation and
apoptosis [37]. Our results showed that with the prolong
of effected time of SJAMP, MST mRNA level elevated
and YAP protein and mRNA level were declined gradually,
while pYAP protein level increased and TEAD1 mRNA
level decreased. It demonstrated that SJAMP could
prompt YAP phosphorylation through MST. The result
of immunofluorescence analysis also indicated that after
effected by SJAMP, there is a nuclear-to-cytoplasmic
translocation of YAP. YAP assembles in cytoplasm and
can’t go into the nucleus, which weakens the effect of
YAP as a kind of cancer gene, inhibits the transcription of
downstream genes.

We also found that after successfully knockeddown by YAP siRNA, the inhibition of proliferation
of SJAMP to cancer cells was attenuated. Our previous
study results indicated that SJAMP could decrease the
expression of TEAD, while after knocked down the YAP
by YAP siRNA, the expression of TEAD still decreased.
That is to say that SJAMP had additional inhibition of
TEAD expression even in the situation of knock-down
of YAP. These results might mean that the SJAMP has
other targets, not only YAP, to downregulate TEAD.
Hippo-YAP pathway has a novel crosstalk with ERK and
AKT pathway. These signaling pathways using CD44 as
an upstream regulator function cooperatively to control
downstream gene expression for cancer cell proliferation
and cell cycle progression [19].
AKT can phosphorylate MST2 and LATS1
phosphorylates Raf-1, which were found to enable Raf-1
to suppress ERK and MST2 signaling [38]. AKT
phosphorylates YAP lead to the nuclear export of YAP
[39]. YAP also can induce ERK and AKT phosphorylation
[17, 18]. Therefore, we proposed another hypothesis to
link them together, which suggested that the signaling

network consisting of ERK, AKT and Hippo-YAP
participated in the inhibition effect of SJAMP to pancreatic
cancer cell proliferation.
Caspase-9 is activated as an initial caspase, and then
further induced the activation of the crack of Caspases and
the cell apoptosis at last [40]. Survivin belongs to apoptosis
inhibiting protein family. It receives apoptotic stimulating
signal and inhibits cell apoptosis through caspase cascade
[41], which roles in apoptosis is much alike with YAP [42].
It will be interesting to indicate whether YAP has tight
relationship with Survivin in pancreatic cancer tissues.
Our study demonstrated that SJAMP could obviously
decrease Survivin and YAP mRNA level and raise the
apoptosis factor caspase-9 mRNA level, which indicated
that SJAMP could excite the mitochondrion apoptosis
pathway and promote the pancreatic cancer cell apoptosis
by inhibiting the expression of Survivin and prompting the
level of Caspase-9.
In conclusion, we report that SJAMP, the marine
medicine, has the effort of anti-tumor. It can inhibit
SW1990 proliferation. Our data suggest the Hippo-YAP
pathway has participate in these processes, implicating
SJAMP potential therapy application to cancer therapy.
We believe that SJAMP may also improve the effect of
chemotherapy drug against pancreatic cancer. However,
further clinical trials are needed to support our strategy for
the treatment for pancreatic cancer.

treatment with YAP siRNA, the same procedures were
performed to SW1990 with 8 mg/ml SJAMP for 24 h,
48 h, 72 h, after transfected with YAP siRNA.

Patient information and tissue specimens
The 45 pairs of PDAC and adjacent non-tumor
samples were used in this study which was diagnosed
by pathological examination at the Affiliated Hospital
of Qingdao University between 2011 and 2013. All
individuals had be informed the purpose of our research
and signed consent on the medical research use of
their personal information and specimens according
the authorization of the Institutional Research Ethics
Committee. The individuals’ information and pathological
characteristics were made a summary in Table 1. The
clinical stages of pancreatic cancer were described using
the tumor-node-metastases (TNM) cancer staging system
announced by the International Union for Cancer Control
(UICC) [44].

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
Human pancreatic cancer and adjacent non-tumor
sections were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to
human YAP1 (1:100, Santa Cruz, USA) at 4°C overnight.
The results of immunohistochemistry staining were
scored by two experienced pathologists independently.
Both the staining intensity and extent were considered.
Staining intensity was scored from 0 to 3. Negative
staining denotes 0; weak staining, light yellow, denotes
1; moderate staining denotes 2; and strong staining, deep
yellow, denotes 3. [45] Percentage of positive tumor cells
were counted to classify the extent of staining; (none,
0; 1–25%, 1; 26–50%, 2; 51–75%, 3; > 75%, 4). The
immunohistochemistry staining results were defined into
four levels considered both staining intensity and extent:
negative (–), weakly positive (+), moderately positive
(++), and strongly positive (+++), corresponding to 0, 1–4,
5–8, and 9–12.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells culture
Pancreatic cancer cell lines SW1990 was cultured
in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 10%
FBS in the condition of 37°C, 5%CO2. SJAMP was bought
from the Medicine College of the Ocean University of
China. When 90% confluent, the experimental groups
were effected by SJAMP of 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 mg/ml for
24 hs. Other experimental groups were affected by SJAMP
of 8 mg/ml for 24 hs, 48 hs and 72 hs respectively. Cell
population has been determined by MTT assay. The
control group was incubated in the absence of SJAMP.

Small interfering RNA transfections

Cell proliferation analysis

To Seed SW1990 into 6-well plates with a cell
density of 2 × 105 per well, and the siRNA was obtained
from GenePharma (Shanghai, China). YAP siRNA and
control sequences were as follows: YAP: 5′-GCAUC
UUCGACAGUCUUCUTT3′ (sense), 5′-AGAAGACUGU
CGAAGAUGCTT-3′ (anti-sense); control: 5′-UUCUCCG
AACGUGUCACGUTT-3′ (sense), 5′-ACGUGACACGU

manufacturer’s instructions, transferring YAP siRNA into
the SW1990 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA).
Western blot was used to analyze the gene-silencing
efficiency.

SW1990 proliferation was evaluated by MTT method
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA). After affected by SJAMP of 0.5, 1,
2, 4, 8 mg/ml for 0, 24, 48, 72 hs, SW1990 were seeded
into 96-well plates with 200 μl medium and 1 × 104 cells
per well. Changing fresh culture medium with MTT
(5 mg/ml in PBS, 200 μl per well) at each time point, and
then continue to incubate for another 4 h [43]. Following
incubation, medium was discarded and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO 150 μl/well; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each
well for 10 mins. Absorbance at 490 nm is analyzed by an

estimated by the 2-tailed Student’s t-test. The significance
of association between YAP immunohistochemistry
expression in pancreatic cancer and histopathological
variables were determined by Chi-square and Fisher
exact test. The relationship between CA199 and YAP
was evaluated using Pearson’s correlation test. To the all
statistical analysis, P-value < 0.05 was considered to have
significant difference.

Samples from pancreatic cancer and adjacent nontumor tissues and from different experiment cell groups
were used to extract the total RNA by Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen) Using 500 ng RNA to reverse transcript to
cDNA using the RNA-to-cDNA kit (TaKaRa, USA). And
then quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) reactions were
carried out using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master
Mix (TaKaRa, USA). The RT products were detected by
PCR reaction which denatured for 30 seconds at 95°C,
5seconds for 95°C, 30s for 60°C by forty cycles in all. All
the data were described using the comparative quantitative
threshold cycle (ΔΔCt) method.
