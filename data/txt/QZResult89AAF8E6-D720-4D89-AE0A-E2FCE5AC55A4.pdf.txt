Abstract:

The discovery of activating BRAF V600E mutations in 50% of all melanoma patients
and the development of small molecule BRAF inhibitors looks set to revolutionize
the therapy of disseminated melanoma. However, in the recent clinical trial of the
BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib (PLX4032), a significant percentage of BRAF V600E
mutant melanoma patients did not meet the RECIST criteria for a response. Recent
work from our lab identified loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin
homolog (PTEN) as being a possible mediator of intrinsic BRAF inhibitor resistance.
In this commentary, we describe the development of a novel mass spectrometry
based proteomic screen of Bcl-2 family proteins that was used to delineate the PTENdependent differences in apoptosis signaling observed when BRAF was inhibited.
We further discuss how use of these sensitive quantitative proteomic methods gives
unique insights into the signaling of cancer cells that are not captured through
routine biochemical techniques and how this may lead to the development of
combination therapy strategies for overcoming intrinsic BRAF inhibitor resistance.

Targeted therapy in melanoma

signaling pathway which drives cell cycle dysregulation
and uncontrolled growth by reducing expression of the
cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27 and by increasing
the expression of cyclin D1 [4, 5]. In addition to its effects
upon cell growth, mutant BRAF also contributes to the
oncogenic phenotype of melanoma cells through both
down regulation of apoptotic signals and enhancement
of cell invasion [6-9]. Recent clinical studies have
demonstrated that the presence of a BRAF mutation is
prognostic for melanoma and is associated with reduced
survival in the metastatic setting [10].
The discovery of activating BRAF mutations in
melanoma prompted a flurry of drug discovery activity
and the development of small molecule BRAF inhibitors.
The list of BRAF inhibitors currently undergoing
preclinical and clinical evaluation includes XL281,
SB590885, GDC-0879, GSK2118438, AZ628 and
PLX4032 [11-14]. Of these, PLX4032 (vemurafenib) and
its analog, PLX4720, have been most extensively studied
[13, 15-18]. Treatment of melanoma cell lines and mouse

Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. It
arises from the malignant transformation of melanocytes
and has long been notorious for its resistance to
chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy.
In recent years, great strides have been made in our
understanding of the underlying genetic and biological
basis of melanoma initiation and development. We now
stand at an exciting juncture in melanoma research in
which our accumulated knowledge about melanoma
biology is translating into new therapeutic strategies. One
key discovery of the last decade is the identification of
activating mutations in the serine/threonine kinase BRAF
in up to 50% of all melanomas [1]. There is now good
evidence that mutated BRAF is a key initiating event
in melanoma development and that continuous BRAF
signaling is required for melanoma progression [2, 3].
Most of the transforming activity of mutant BRAF is
mediated through the activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK

to require signaling activity in many other pathways,
with the PI3K/AKT pathway thought to be particularly
important for both melanoma initiation and progression
[2, 27, 28]. In a recent study, our lab identified loss of
expression of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and
tensin homolog (PTEN) as being predictive for an
impaired apoptotic response when BRAF was inhibited
[29]. Mechanistically it was noted that inhibition of
BRAF in PTEN null melanoma cells was associated with
an increase in phospho-AKT expression which led in turn
to the decreased nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a [29].
As no studies had yet addressed the mechanism by
which PTEN expression regulated the apoptotic response
following BRAF inhibition, we developed a novel mass
spectrometry based technique to simultaneously quantify
a large panel of Bcl-2 family proteins. As our approach,
we used selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry
(SRM-MS), a method that was originally developed to
enable quantification of analytes in complex mixtures.
This technology (LC-SRM-MS) has been applied to the
detection and quantification of small molecules (MW <
500 Da) for decades, and is used routinely to test for drugs
of abuse and performance enhancement and to define
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic
compounds. It was first applied to endogenous peptides
in the early 1990’s [30]. However, the use of triple
quadrupole mass spectrometers to monitor proteolytic
peptides as surrogates for the expression of a protein
was first described in 1996 [31]. LC-MRM with the
addition of spiked stable isotope labeled peptides enables
quantification of the number of moles (or molecules) of
the endogenous protein; this method has been termed
absolute quantification (AQUA) [32-34]. It is important
to note that this technique establishes a minimum value
for the amount of the protein as the digestion and peptide
recovery are incomplete (although they are extremely
consistent).
When analyzing multiple fragments from different
molecules, the technique is also called multiple reaction
monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS). The
“reaction” is the conversion of the intact molecule into
fragment ion(s) specific for its structure (see Figure 1A);
this molecule-fragment pair is also termed a transition.
Each “reaction” is optimized by the choice of background
gas (typically argon or nitrogen) the pressure in the
collision cell, and the collision energy applied. When
coupled with reversed-phase liquid chromatography, three
characteristics of the molecule are used to isolate its signal
for detection and quantification: hydrophobicity (which
defines the elution time), the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z)
of the intact molecule, and fragment ion mass-to-charge
ratio.
This research arena is extremely active and
competitive; methods for assessment of panels of protein
biomarkers and pipeline development have been described
in recent publications [35-39]. Furthermore, LC-MRM

xenografts with PLX4032/4720 led to both G1 phase cell
cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis [13, 15]. The
effects of PLX4032 were noted to be BRAF mutation
specific, and equivalent responses were seen in melanoma
models with both heterozygous and homozygous BRAF
mutations [13]. No anti-proliferative or cytotoxic effects
were observed in melanoma cell cultures that lacked
the BRAF mutation. Interestingly, not all BRAF mutated
melanoma cell lines were similarly sensitive to PLX4032
and PLX4720 though, with some cell lines exhibiting
intrinsic resistance [17-19].
In the phase I clinical trial, vemurafenib led to
significant levels of tumor shrinkage in 80% of patients
whose melanomas harbored the BRAF V600E mutation
[20]. This was an unprecedented result for a melanoma
clinical trial and quickly led to the initiation of both
phase II and phase III single agent trials [21]. The phase
III trial of vemurafenib closed early when the primary
progression free survival endpoint was met and the data
has been submitted to the FDA for regulatory approval.
Although the results from the vemurafenib trial were
very impressive, responses were unfortunately shortlived with most patients ultimately failing therapy and
becoming resistant (median progression free survival ~7
months) [20]. The development of strategies to manage
and overcome acquired BRAF inhibitor resistance is
now the major challenge facing the melanoma research
community.
The emerging evidence suggests that acquired
resistance to vemurafenib is complex and multi-factorial
[17, 22-26]. Already, studies have shown that resistance
can be mediated via increased receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) signaling, the acquisition of activating mutations
in NRAS, novel mutations in MEK1 and up regulation
of MAP3K8 (Cot) [22-26]. Although the resistance
mechanisms reported thus far are diverse, most are
associated with the re-establishment of MAPK signaling
and/or an increase in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling [2226]. Clinical trials are currently ongoing to validate the
combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAF
V600E mutant melanoma, with trials on the combination
of BRAF with AKT inhibitors due to commence in the
near future. The end goal of these studies is to define
an optimal combination therapy strategy with the aim
of extending the time to relapse and improving overall
survival.

Using proteomics to understand
the mechanisms of intrinsic BRAF
inhibitor resistance
Approximately 20% of BRAF V600E mutant
melanoma patients on the phase I trial of vemurafenib
appeared to be intrinsically resistant and did not meet the
RECIST criteria for a response [20]. Although uniquely
addicted to MAPK signaling, melanomas are also known

Q1: Select
Peptide Ion

BIM is a pro-apoptotic BH3-only domain protein
that is regulated both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally by many signaling pathways including
BRAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, p38 MAPK and JNK/
SAPK [43]. It exerts its pro-apoptotic effects by binding to
and antagonizing the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-w,
Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 [44, 45]. In BRAF mutant melanoma
cells, inhibition of BRAF using small molecule inhibitors
and siRNA knockdown leads to the induction of apoptosis
via a mechanism involving the decreased phosphorylation
of BAD at Ser-75, an upregulation of BMF and an increase
in BIM expression [6, 46, 47]. The identification of BIM as
a key PTEN-regulated apoptotic mediator in BRAF mutant
melanoma cells allowed a novel mechanism of intrinsic
drug resistance to be elucidated whereby the paradoxical
activation of AKT in PTEN null cells led to a suppression

shows promise in translation to the assessment of patients.
Of equal importance, LC-MRM can be effective in
elucidating biological processes; this technology has been
used to monitor protein post-translational modifications as
well as signaling networks [40-42]. Our study used SDSPAGE protein fractionation combined with LC-MRM
detection and quantification to evaluate the expression
of apoptosis-regulating proteins in the Bcl-2 family. The
quantification of multiple family members is critical due
to the redundancy of their function, and LC-MRM has the
capability to measure large numbers of low abundance
proteins in a single experiment. Quantification of these
proteins revealed a differential up regulation of BIM
between the PTEN expressing and PTEN null cells when
BRAF was inhibited (14-fold increase vs 4-fold increase,
respectively) (Figure 1B) [29].

reversed-phase HPLC separation, peptides are selected by their mass-to-charge ratio and dissociated by collisions with background gas before
the fragment ions are mass selected to enable specific detection and quantification of individual peptides in complex mixtures (A).   This
technique was applied to the measurement of expression of apoptosis-regulating proteins in the Bcl-2 family to determine the mechanism for
PTEN null melanoma cells’ resistance to the BRAF V600E inhibitor, PLX4720 (inset).  Both the heat map and the bar graph indicate that the
major difference between the two cell lines was the upregulation of Bim, which caused apoptosis in PTEN positive cells.  Regulation of the
other Bcl-2 family proteins was similar regardless of PTEN status.

MRM platforms should soon emerge as competitors for
array technologies. Just as peptide sequencing with liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS) has revolutionized biology, the ability of LC-MRM
to detect and quantify low abundance targets determined a
priori represents the next potential impact that proteomics
can have on the study of human disease. As we have
demonstrated, these methods have particular utility
in unraveling how the genetic makeup of cancer cells
can dictate drug response. As cancer therapy becomes
ever more personalized, and the LC-MRM technology
becomes more sophisticated, a future can be envisioned
in which the key determinants of drug response can be
determined in individual patient samples. It is hoped
that these new approaches could allow therapies to be
specifically tailored to individual patients so that efficacy
can be maximized and off-target effects minimized.

of the nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a and a reduction
in BIM mRNA [29]. Of potential clinical relevance it
was noted that dual inhibition of both BRAF and PI3K
restored nuclear FOXO3a accumulation, upregulated
BIM expression at the mRNA and protein levels and
enhanced the level of apoptosis [29]. Similar results were
also noted in melanoma cells intrinsically resistant to
the MEK inhibitor AZD6244, where sensitivity could be
restored by the dual inhibition of both MEK and IGF1R,
mTORC1/2 or AKT [48]. Further support for the role for
AKT signaling in intrinsic BRAF inhibitor resistance
came from other studies showing that overexpression of
an active form of AKT3 (myristolated AKT3) prevented
apoptosis in BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cells when
BRAF was inhibited [49].
The use of LC-MRM allowed the level of BIM
expression to be identified as a PTEN-dependent
determinant of BRAF inhibitor mediated apoptosis. If
it were not for the exquisite sensitivity of the LC-MRM
approach and the ability to accurately quantify peptide
levels, the PTEN dependency of BIM expression in this
process may not have been realized. The utility and value of
LC-MRM comes primarily from the fact that experiments
can be designed to evaluate the full complexity and detail
of biological processes in different human disease states.

Current value and projected
future potential of LC-MRM
protein quantification
Quantitative mass spectrometry, particularly LCMRM, is emerging as an alternative to antibody-based
methods for the detection and quantification of proteins
(such as Western Blotting). The development of peptidebased assays for protein expression, modification, and
even mutations can be implemented very rapidly [50].
The selection of the target peptide sequence from either
existing tandem mass spectrometry data or LC-MRM
screening of peptide candidates, synthesis of stable
isotope-labeled standards, and analysis to examine the
match between the elution time and fragmentation patterns
of the endogenous and standard peptide can be completed
within a few days. Current mass spectrometers can
analyze hundreds to thousands of transitions (peptide and
fragment pairs) in each experiment enabling quantification
of numerous proteins. While one peptide could be used
as a surrogate, typically three or more transitions from
three or more peptides are recommended for quantifying
protein expression. Unlike antibody-based methods that
are completely reliant on the reagents and the epitopes
that they recognize, protein measurements with LC-MRM
have a great deal more flexibility [51]. If an assay has
interference, additional steps can be taken to change the
protein purification, select another peptide, or even just
select a different fragment ion from the same peptide.
