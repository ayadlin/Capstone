Abstract

Author Manuscript

Oncogenic Ras expression is associated with activation of the DNA damage response (DDR)
pathway, as evidenced by elevated DNA damage, primarily DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs),
and activation of DNA damage checkpoints, which in primary human cells leads to entry into
senescence. DDR activation is viewed as a physiological barrier against uncontrolled proliferation
in oncogenic Ras-expressing cells, and arises in response to genotoxic stress due to the production
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage DNA, and to hyper-replication stress. Although
oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is considered a tumor suppressor mechanism, the
accumulation of DNA damage in senescent cells is thought to cause genomic instability,
eventually allowing secondary hits in the genome that promote tumorigenesis. To date, the
molecular mechanisms behind DNA repair defects during OIS remain poorly understood. Here,
we show that oncogenic Ras expression in human primary cells results in down-regulation of
BRCA1 and 53BP1, two key factors in DNA DSBs repair by homologous recombination (HR) and
non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), respectively. As a consequence, Ras-induced senescent cells
are hindered in their ability to recruit BRCA1 and 53BP1 to DNA damage sites. While BRCA1 is
down-regulated at transcripts levels, 53BP1 loss is caused by activation of cathepsin L (CTSL)mediated degradation of 53BP1 protein. Moreover, we discovered a marked down-regulation of
vitamin D receptor (VDR) during OIS, and a role for the vitamin D/VDR axis regulating the levels
of these DNA repair factors during OIS. This study reveals a new functional relationship between
the oncogene Ras, the vitamin D/VDR axis, and the expression of DNA repair factors, in the
context of OIS. The observed deficiencies in DNA repair factors in senescent cells could
contribute to the genomic instability that allows senescence bypass and tumorigenesis.

INTRODUCTION
Expression of oncogenic Ras in primary human cells results in a growth-arrest known as
oncogene-induced senescence (OIS)8, 9, 50. This is more commonly observed in human preneoplasia than in neoplastic lesions, and is considered a tumor suppressor
mechanism4, 19, 27. There is strong evidence that establishment of OIS is tightly dependent
on persistent activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway due to replication
stress1, 3, 18, 39, 40 and/or increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)37, 58. In fact,
cells expressing oncogenic Ras but unable to activate DDR do not enter senescence4, 18.
Similarly, oncogene expression in non-replicating cells does not trigger DDR. Although
these findings stress the importance of DDR activation during OIS, we have limited
understanding about the integrity of DNA repair mechanisms in senescent cells.

Author Manuscript

Recent studies reported that oncogenic Ras inactivates the BRCA1 DNA repair complex by
dissociating BRCA1 from chromatin, coinciding with DNA damage accumulation prior to
senescence55, 56. Importantly, these cells subjected to DNA damage by ionizing radiation
(IR) during replication, bypass senescence and become transformed more efficiently than
not irradiated cells. Thus, oncogenic Ras-induced BRCA1 loss of function was proposed to
predispose senescent cells to additional hits in the genome that promote senescence bypass
and eventually cellular transformation.

Author Manuscript

The reduced association of BRCA1 to chromatin could explain at least in part the
accumulation of DNA damage during hyper-replication, due to inefficient DNA repair by
homologous recombination (HR). Previous studies have shown that genomic instability in
BRCA1-deficient cells is tightly linked to the function of 53BP1. Recruitment of 53BP1 to
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) facilitates DNA repair by non-homologous end joining
(NHEJ) while inhibiting end-resection at the break, a prerequisite for HR5, 6, 10. Thus,
BRCA1 and 53BP1 seem to compete for DNA repair substrate and facilitate either HR or
NHEJ, respectively. This competition is important for the maintenance of genome integrity,
with loss of either BRCA1 or 53BP1 resulting in genomic instability and cancer
susceptibility35, 42. In contrast, loss of 53BP1 alleviates HR defects in BRCA1-deficient
cells. While loss of BRCA1 function in mice causes embryonic lethality, depletion of 53BP1
in this context rescues lethality10. Thus, 53BP1 loss is synthetically viable with the loss of
BRCA12, 34, 38. Moreover, reduced 53BP1 expression is observed in triple negative breast
cancers (TNBC) and BRCA1-mutated tumors, suggesting that 53BP1 loss contributes to the
survival of BRCA1-deficient cells5, 29. Whether or not the function of 53BP1 is altered
during Ras-induced senescence remains unknown.

Our studies showed a correlation between 53BP1 and BRCA1 levels in a variety of contexts.
Human fibroblasts and cancer cells (MCF7) growth-arrested by contact inhibition or serum
deprivation exhibit reduced BRCA1 and 53BP1 levels14. Growth-arrested cells downregulate BRCA1 expression and up-regulate the protease cathepsin L (CTSL), which is
responsible for 53BP1 protein degradation. In addition, BRCA1 depletion in MCF7 cells
results in genomic instability and growth arrest. However, after approximately two to three
weeks in growth arrest, BRCA1-deficient cells activate CTSL-mediated degradation of
53BP1 as a means to overcome the proliferation arrest induced by BRCA1 loss29. Similarly,

depletion of lamin A/C proteins results in reduced BRCA1 expression and activation of
CTSL-mediated degradation of 53BP1, concomitant with DNA damage
accumulation25, 45, 46. Altogether, these studies suggest that BRCA1 and 53BP1 levels are
down-regulated in response to a variety of stress conditions that cause growth arrest.
Whether the loss of BRCA1 function during Ras-induced senescence55 impacts on 53BP1
levels is unknown.

Author Manuscript

Our analysis of tissue microarrays from breast cancer patients revealed nuclear accumulation
of CTSL primarily in TNBC and BRCA1-mutated tumors29, and an inverse correlation with
53BP1 levels. These data suggest that nuclear CTSL could contribute to 53BP1 loss.
Moreover, subsets of TNBC and most BRCA1-deficient tumors analyzed exhibit reduced
VDR levels, which correlate with accumulation of nuclear CTSL, and reduced 53BP1
levels29. These results suggest that vitamin D/VDR might regulate CTSL-mediated
degradation of 53BP1. In support of this notion, vitamin D treatment inhibits CTSLmediated degradation of 53BP1 in a variety of contexts, including BRCA1-deficient and
lamin A/C-deficient cells25, 29.

Author Manuscript

Overall, these studies suggest a functional relationship between BRCA1, CTSL-mediated
degradation of 53BP1, and the vitamin D/VDR axis. Given that Ras-induced senescence
causes BRCA1 dissociation from chromatin55 and that Ras expression up-regulates
CTSL13, 17, 28, 57, we determined whether 53BP1 is down-regulated during Ras-induced
senescence, and whether vitamin D/VDR regulate this process. Here, we show that
expression of oncogenic Ras (H-RasG12V) in primary human fibroblasts results in downregulation of BRCA1 expression and activation of CTSL-mediated degradation of 53BP1. In
addition, we discover a marked down-regulation of VDR during Ras-induced senescence.
Importantly, stabilization of VDR via vitamin D treatment restores near normal levels of
BRCA1 and 53BP1, and their recruitment to sites of DNA damage. This study demonstrates
a functional relationship between the oncogene Ras, the vitamin D/VDR axis, and the
expression of DNA repair factors, in the context of OIS.

RESULTS
Ras-induced senescence leads to up-regulation of CTSL, reduced levels of DNA repair
factors, and down-regulation of VDR

Author Manuscript

Given our findings that CTSL regulate the levels of 53BP1 in tumor and normal
cells14, 25, 29, we determined whether over-expression of oncogenic Ras results in the
activation of this regulatory mechanism in human cells. As previously reported, retroviral
transduction of the constitutive active form of H-Ras (H-RasG12V) in human primary
fibroblasts immortalized with telomerase (BJ+hTert) results in the establishment of
senescence8, 9, 50, as shown by the typical flat morphology, positivity for β-galactosidase
(SA-β-Gal) activity (Fig 1A), presence of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci
(SAHF) (Fig 1B), accumulation of cells in G2 phase of the cell cycle (Fig 1C), and loss of
Cyclin A expression (Fig 1D). These senescent cells display a marked up-regulation of
CTSL at protein and transcript levels as assessed by immunoblottting (Fig 1D&1E) and
qRT-PCR, respectively (Fig 1F). Interestingly, CTSL upregulation correlates with a marked

decrease in 53BP1 protein (Fig 1D&1E), but not in transcripts levels (Fig 1F), suggesting
that CTSL-mediated degradation of 53BP1 might be activated during OIS.

Author Manuscript

In addition, oncogenic Ras-induced senescent cells exhibit deficiencies in the DNA repair
factors BRCA1 and RAD51, at both protein and transcript levels (Figs 1D–1F). RAD51
decrease might be explained by the fact that this factor is regulated during the cell
cycle36, 60. In addition, a progressive reduction of RAD51 expression has been reported
during replicative senescence41. In contrast, there is no evidence for down-regulation of
BRCA1 or 53BP1 levels during OIS. One study showed however that BRCA1 association
with chromatin is reduced during Ras-induced senescence, although the global protein levels
did not change55. In our hands, we find down-regulation of BRCA1 at transcript and protein
levels in senescent cells expressing H-RasG12V (Figs 1D–1F). Importantly, the same
upregulation of CTSL and downregulation of DNA repair factors BRCA1, RAD51, and
53BP1 were observed in IMR90 cells transduced with oncogenic Ras (Figs 1G–1I),
indicating that this is not a cell type-specific phenotype.
Previous studies showed that Ras activation induces VDR mRNA instability in tumor cells
and reduces nuclear VDR activity in mouse fibroblasts48, 54. Thus, we determined whether
VDR levels are altered during OIS. We show that VDR is down-regulated at protein and
transcripts levels during Ras-induced senescence (Figs 1D–1F).

Overall, these studies reveal a marked reduction in the levels of key factors in DNA repair
(53BP1 and BRCA1), and in VDR expression, during Ras-induced senescence. To
determine if these deficiencies are due to growth arrest per se, we used different strategies to
induce senescence. BJ+hTert fibroblasts were subjected to bleomycin or hydrogen peroxide
treatments and senescence evaluated by positivity for SA-β-Gal activity (Fig 2A), decreased
Ki67 levels (Fig 2B), accumulation of cells in G1/G2 phases (Fig 2C), and changes in
Cyclin A and p21 (Fig 2D). Importantly, these strategies to induce senescence do not result
in down-regulation of BRCA1, 53BP1, or VDR (Fig 2D), indicating that expression of
oncogenic Ras, and not only senescence, is responsible for the deficiencies in these factors
during OIS. In addition, we treated human fibroblasts (BJ and IMR90) with hydroxyurea
(HU) to induce replication stress-induced senescence (Fig 2E–2G). We observed downregulation of VDR expression in response to HU, but not of DNA repair factors 53BP1 and
BRCA1 (Fig 2G). These data suggest that VDR deficiency might be linked to replication
stress during OIS, but not the DNA repair deficiencies, which are only observed upon
expression of oncogenic Ras. In contrast, expression of oncogenic Ras in tumor cell lines
(MCF7 and HeLa) did not result in growth arrest or downregulation of VDR or DNA repair
factors (Fig 2H), suggesting that these alterations might involve tumor suppressor
mechanisms, which are lost in tumor cells.
CTSL is responsible for 53BP1 loss during Ras-induced senescence
During Ras-induced senescence, we found a correlation between up-regulation of CTSL
expression and reduced 53BP1 protein levels, without changes in 53BP1 transcript levels
(Figs 1D–1G). To determine if CTSL is responsible for 53BP1 degradation in this context,
we depleted CTSL prior to expression of oncogenic Ras in BJ+hTert cells. Depletion of
CTSL prior to Ras expression abrogates 53BP1 loss (Fig 3A). Of note, expression of Ras in

CTSL-depleted cells results in a slight increase in the levels of the protease, reflecting the
dramatic effect that Ras exerts on its expression. In fact, we detected a 53BP1 protein of
lower molecular weight in these cells, possibly indicating that some degradation is taking
place. These results demonstrate that CTSL is required for the degradation of 53BP1 during
Ras-induced senescence.

Author Manuscript

Next, we determined if the decrease in 53BP1 has functional consequences, by assessing the
ability of Ras-senescent cells to recruit 53BP1 protein to ionizing radiation (IR)-induced
DNA damage sites. Irradiation of control and Ras-senescent cells results in proper activation
of the DDR pathway, with 100% of cells being positive for γH2AX ionizing radiationinduced foci (IRIF) formation (Figs 3B&3C). Interestingly, while the majority of control
cells are positive for 53BP1 IRIF formation, Ras-senescent cells exhibit a decreased ability
to form 53BP1 IRIF. This is consistent with the reduction in 53BP1 global levels.
Importantly, depletion of CTSL rescues the formation of 53BP1 IRIF in Ras-senescent cells.
These data indicate that CTSL-mediated degradation of 53BP1 is activated during Rasinduced senescence, hindering the recruitment of this important DNA repair factor to sites of
DNA damage.
To determine if the stabilization of 53BP1 has consequences for OIS, we monitored the
entry into senescence of cells depleted of CTSL. As shown in Fig 3D, expression of
oncogenic Ras in CTSL-depleted cells results in a more robust G2 arrest, when compared to
CTSL-proficient cells expressing Ras, and at all times tested. However, positivity for SA-βGal activity was similar in both contexts (Fig 3E). These results suggest that although
stabilization of 53BP1 promotes a growth arrest in G2, it does not affect the overall extent of
OIS.

Author Manuscript

Down-regulation of VDR leads to an imbalance between BRCA1 and 53BP1, which is
responsible for premature entry into senescence
A functional relationship between BRCA1 and the vitamin D/VDR axis has been previously
suggested. Studies showed that vitamin D/VDR regulates indirectly the expression of
BRCA17, and that BRCA1 interacts with VDR16. Our own studies in normal fibroblasts and
fibroblasts derived from patients with Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome revealed that
depletion of VDR results in decreased levels of BRCA1, and accumulation of DNA damage
(γH2AX foci) (Kreienkamp et al. unpublished). Given our findings that VDR levels are
decreased during Ras-induced senescence, we determined whether VDR deficiency could
contribute to DNA repair defects.

Author Manuscript

As shown in Fig 4A, depletion of VDR in BJ+hTert fibroblasts via lentiviral transduction
with two independent shRNAs results in down-regulation of BRCA1 transcripts,
concomitant with decreased protein levels (Fig 4B), mirroring Ras-induced senescent cells.
In contrast, we did not find alterations in CTSL or 53BP1 protein levels upon VDR
depletion (Fig 4B). Importantly, VDR depletion leads to accumulation of DNA damage, as
shown by increased global levels of γH2AX by immunoblotting (Fig 4B), and increased
percentage of γH2AX-positive cells by immunofluorescence (Fig 4C). Moreover, VDR
depletion results in growth arrest and establishment of senescence, as shown by positivity for
SA-β-Gal activity (Fig 4D), accumulation of cells in G1 phase (Fig 4E), and high expression

of p21 (Fig 4B). The effect of VDR depletion triggering senescence was more robust than
oncogenic Ras expression. While growth arrest is established over the course of the first
week upon H-RasG12V transduction, VDR loss-induced growth arrest is established within
the third day after VDR depletion.
Consistent with the decrease in BRCA1 levels, VDR-depleted cells were hindered in their
ability to form BRCA1 IRIF (Figs 5A&5B), suggesting that VDR deficiency could
contribute to defects in BRCA1-mediated DNA repair by HR during OIS. VDR-depleted
cells were able to activate the DDR in response to IR, as shown by positivity for γH2AX
IRIF formation (Figs 5C&5D), and did not show deficiencies in 53BP1 IRIF (Figs 5E&5F).

To test directly if VDR loss affects DNA repair by HR, we depleted VDR in MCF7 cells
carrying an HR reporter construct. Depletion of VDR results in a marked decrease in GFPpositive cells, indicating that VDR deficiency hinders DNA repair by HR (Fig 6A).
Altogether, these data demonstrate that VDR depletion leads to an imbalance between
BRCA1 and 53BP1. This scenario is known to induce profound genomic instability and
proliferation arrest; phenotypes that are rescued by lowering 53BP1 levels29. Thus, one
possible explanation for the most robust growth arrest when compared to Ras-expressing
cells is that VDR-depleted cells express normal levels of 53BP1, in a context of BRCA1
deficiency. To test this hypothesis, we depleted 53BP1 prior to depletion of VDR in BJ
+hTert cells. As shown in Fig 6B, we achieved a marked depletion of both VDR and 53BP1,
and BRCA1 levels were maintained in 53BP1-depleted cells, but not in VDR-depleted cells,
as expected. Interestingly, depletion of 53BP1 abrogates the ability of BJ+hTert cells to
growth arrest upon depletion of VDR, as shown by decreased positivity for SA-β-Gal
activity (Fig 6C), and by proliferation rate (Fig 6D). These data uncover a critical role for
53BP1 in the establishment of senescence due to VDR loss, as previously shown in the
context of BRCA1 depletion29.
In summary, our results are consistent with VDR transcription factor playing a role in the
maintenance of genomic stability by being involved in the regulation of BRCA1 expression,
and with VDR loss contributing to DNA repair defects during Ras-induced senescence. In
contrast, CTSL up-regulation and 53BP1 decrease are not observed during VDR lossinduced senescence suggesting that Ras regulates these processes independently of VDR.
We also provide evidence for the importance of a balance between 53BP1 and BRCA1 to
maintain genome stability and normal proliferation.
Vitamin D treatment rescues the levels of DNA repair factors during oncogenic Rasinduced senescence

Author Manuscript

To investigate further the functional relationship between vitamin D/VDR and DNA repair
factors during OIS, we monitored the effect of activation of VDR by vitamin D in this
context. Vitamin D (1α,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3) or vehicle were added to BJ+hTert cells
on day 4 after transduction with oncogenic Ras, and cells collected 48–72 hours later for
immunoblotting and qRT-PCR analyses. At this point, cells exhibit all the characteristics of
senescence. As expected, vitamin D treatment increases VDR levels20, demonstrating that
the treatment was effective (Fig 7A). Interestingly, vitamin D treatment increases BRCA1
protein (Fig 7A) and transcripts (Fig 7B) levels in senescent cells, when compared to
Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 October 14.

vehicle-treated cells. These data support the notion that VDR down-regulation contributes to
BRCA1 reduction during Ras-induced senescence. In addition, vitamin D stabilizes, at least
partially, the levels of 53BP1 protein in senescent cells (Fig 7A), without affecting 53BP1
transcripts levels (Fig 7B), which could be explained by the role that vitamin D plays
inhibiting CTSL activity25. These results, and data showing that VDR depletion does not
activate CTSL-mediated degradation of 53BP1 suggest that VDR deficiency during OIS
does not contribute to 53BP1 loss. However, once this mechanism is activated by Ras
expression, vitamin D/VDR can inhibit 53BP1 degradation by regulating the levels/activity
of CTSL, as previously reported in other contexts25, 29. Overall, our results support the
notion that VDR, the main effector of vitamin D’s genomic actions, is involved in the
regulation of DNA repair factors such as 53BP1 and BRCA1, which play critical roles in the
maintenance of genomic stability. During OIS, the expression of Ras activates CTSLmediated degradation of 53BP1, and the concomitant decrease in VDR expression could
contribute to BRCA1 loss.
Next, we tested whether vitamin D supplementation started concomitant with oncogenic Ras
expression would have an impact on the onset of senescence (Figs 7C–7E). As shown in Fig
7C, Ras-expressing cells show decreased levels of VDR, which are rescued by 1,25D
treatment. We found modest decreases in the percentage of G2-arrested cells (Fig 7D) and of
SA-β-Gal positive cells (Fig 7E) at all times tested, however vitamin D treatment was not
sufficient to prevent OIS. Thus, we speculate that although activation of vitamin D/VDR
signaling does not impact the onset of OIS, it might improve DNA repair capabilities in
senescent cells, reducing the occurrence of secondary hits in the genome that promote
malignant transformation.

Vitamin D treatment improves DNA repair in Ras-induced senescent cells

Author Manuscript

Given the reduced BRCA1 and 53BP1 levels observed in Ras-induced senescent cells, we
investigated the ability of these factors to be recruited to sites of DNA damage induced by
IR. Senescent cells were irradiated, and the formation of DNA repair foci labeled with
γH2AX, BRCA1, or 53BP1 monitored by immunofluorescence. As expected, Ras-senescent
cells accumulate basal levels of DNA damage (58% γH2AX-positive), when compared to
control cells (15% γH2AX-positive) (Fig 8A&8B). In contrast, Ras-senescent cells are
hindered in their ability to recruit 53BP1 to sites of basal DNA damage (6% 53BP1positive). This is consistent with the global reduction in 53BP1 levels, which could hinder
DNA repair by NHEJ. Importantly, while 100% of Ras-senescent cells are positive for
γH2AX IRIF formation, and thus able to activate DDR, only 67% show positivity for 53BP1
IRIF, supporting the idea that these cells exhibit DNA repair deficiencies. Significantly,
vitamin D treatment of Ras-senescent cells increases 53BP1 foci formation both under basal
conditions and in response to IR. Similarly, we found a low percentage of BRCA1-positive
cells in irradiated Ras-senescent cells, indicating defects in BRCA1 recruitment to sites of
DNA damage, which is indicative of HR defects. Importantly, vitamin D treatment rescues
the ability of Ras-senescent cells to recruit BRCA1 to IRIF (Fig 8A&8B).
These results suggest that vitamin D, by stabilizing 53BP1 and BRCA1 levels, restores the
function of these important DNA repair factors during Ras-induced senescence. To the best

of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the down-regulation of DNA repair factors
during OIS, and a mechanism through which the DNA repair deficiencies might be, at least
in part, rescued.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Our study reveals new molecular mechanisms contributing to OIS (Fig 9). In particular,
expression of oncogenic Ras results in down-regulation of VDR and DNA repair factors
such as BRCA1 and 53BP1, which are essential for the maintenance of genome stability.
Consequently, recruitment of these factors to DNA damage sites is impaired in Ras-induced
senescent cells. These alterations are not observed in other types of senescence such as that
induced by bleomycin or hydrogen peroxide treatments, indicating that they are not solely
the result of growth arrest. Importantly, we uncover an unprecedented role for the vitamin
D/VDR axis regulating DNA repair factors during OIS. We find that vitamin D treatment
stabilizes VDR, BRCA1 and 53BP1 levels, rescuing at least partially the recruitment of
these DNA repair factors to sites of damage in senescent cells. Altogether these studies
suggest that Ras-induced senescent cells could be hindered in their ability to deal with
endogenous and exogenous DNA damaging insults, which could facilitate the acquisition of
secondary hits in the genome that allow senescence bypass and cellular transformation.
Maintaining the levels of VDR in senescent cells could potentially improve their DNA repair
capabilities and ameliorate the genomic instability that drives malignancy.

Author Manuscript

Mechanistically, we propose that reduced expression of VDR during OIS contributes to the
down-regulation of BRCA1, since depletion of VDR results in decreased BRCA1 transcripts
and protein levels, defects in BRCA1 recruitment of DNA damage sites, and deficiency in
DNA repair by HR. Ligand binding to VDR increases VDR expression, as previously
reported in other contexts30. This counteracts VDR deficiency during OIS, which in turn
increases BRCA1 expression. However, it is likely that activation of vitamin D/VDR
signaling impacts other cellular pathways, with consequences for proliferation, senescence,
and potentially for transformation. Future studies are needed to understand in depth the
consequences of VDR deficiency in genomic instability during tumorigenesis.

Author Manuscript

Importantly, we show for the first time that VDR depletion leads to a prompt growth arrest
with characteristics of senescence, which is dependent upon the presence of 53BP1. As
such, depletion of 53BP1 abrogates growth arrest in VDR-depleted cells. These results
support our previous findings that MCF7 cells depleted of BRCA1 undergo growth arrest
due to the aberrant up-regulation of 53BP1-mediated NHEJ, which causes chromosomal
instability29. In this context, depletion of 53BP1 also prevents the proliferation arrest. Our
findings are also consistent with landmark studies showing that 53BP1 loss is synthetically
viable with the loss of BRCA1, and that the imbalance between 53BP1 and BRCA1 causes
genomic instability and growth arrest5, 6, 10, 34, 38. Our data suggest that 53BP1 plays a
major role in the growth arrest imposed by VDR loss and HR deficiency, acting as a tumor
suppressor mechanism. Consistent with this notion, reduced expression of 53BP1 has been
observed in breast tumors from patients carrying germ-line mutations in BRCA1, and in
TNBC, which are often deficient in DNA repair by HR5, 29. Based on all these data, we
propose that 53BP1 plays an active role in senescence induced by genomic instability due to

HR defects, such as in BRCA1- and VDR-depleted cells, and that loss of 53BP1 allows
evasion of this barrier to tumor progression. Importantly, the fact that Ras-induced senescent
cells reduce 53BP1 levels during the senescence phase in the context of BRCA1 deficiency,
support the idea that these cells could be more prone to transformation, when compared to
other senescent cells where BRCA1 and 53BP1 remain highly expressed. In tissues, OIS is
thought to arrest tumor growth before cells become malignant12. Thus, senescent cells are
typically observed in benign neoplastic lesions, but not in malignant cancers. Interestingly,
analysis of several benign and malignant human neoplasms revealed a clear abundance of
53BP1-labeled DNA repair foci in benign lesions, and a marked decrease in 53BP1
positivity in cancerous lesions, including melanomas and invasive breast and colon
carcinomas53.

The role of 53BP1 in tumor suppression stresses the importance of identifying molecular
mechanisms responsible for its loss in tumor cells and in senescent cells, as shown in this
study. These mechanisms could represent novel therapeutic targets. Our previous studies
identified one molecular mechanism regulating 53BP1 levels. We found that upregulation of
CTSL and its entry into the nucleus is responsible for 53BP1 protein degradation in a variety
of contexts, i.e. mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in lamin A/C25, MCF7 cells depleted
of BRCA129, and primary human fibroblasts and MCF7 cells growth arrested by contact
inhibition or serum deprivation14. As such, depletion of CTSL in all these contexts results in
stabilization of 53BP1, rescuing its targeting to DNA repair sites. Here, we show that this
mechanism of regulation of 53BP1 is also activated during Ras-induced senescence. This
finding is highly significant, since up-regulation of CTSL has been observed in a variety of
cancers and associated with increased invasiveness, metastasis, and overall degree of
malignancy23, 33, 51. Future studies need to determine whether activation of CTSL-mediated
degradation of 53BP1 in senescent cells contributes to senescence bypass and
transformation. Importantly, we demonstrate the ability to regulate 53BP1 protein levels by
vitamin D treatment in senescent cells. Our study reveals a new potential therapeutic strategy
to maintain 53BP1 levels in senescent cells as well as in cells already transformed. In
particular, maintaining high levels of 53BP1 could prevent proliferation and survival of
senescent or transformed cells that exhibit genomic instability due to defects in HR.

The importance of the vitamin D/VDR axis in tumor suppression has been extensively
reported. Epidemiological studies showed that vitamin D/VDR deficiency enhances cancer
risk, and that vitamin D treatment has anti-proliferative effects in a variety of cancers15, 43.
In addition, VDR expression has been associated with improved overall survival in cancer
patients, including patients with tumors of poor prognosis such as human glioblastoma
multiforme49, and non-small cell lung cancer52. Moreover, a high prevalence of vitamin D
deficiency has been reported among African-American women, who are disproportionately
affected by TNBC11, 44, 59. The TNBC phenotype is associated with mutations in BRCA1
and defects in HR, thus suggesting that VDR deficiency could be linked to the high
incidence of these tumors in African-American women. However, the molecular
mechanisms by which deficiencies in the vitamin D/VDR axis contribute to malignancy
remain poorly understood. This study and our previous findings25, 26, 29 support a role for
vitamin D/VDR regulating DNA repair factors with key roles in the maintenance of genome
stability. Here, we demonstrate that VDR depletion results in BRCA1 reduction and HR

defects, which in turn results in a prompt growth arrest of primary human cells. Activation
of CTSL-mediated degradation of 53BP1 in senescent cells, either due to direct upregulation
of CTSL, such as in Ras-induced senescent cells, or via alternative unknown mechanisms,
could prime cells for senescence bypass. In the context of tumor cells, VDR and BRCA1
deficiencies would in principle sensitize tumor cells to DNA-damaging strategies. However,
we also found a correlation between VDR deficiency and loss of 53BP129, a well-known
mechanism of therapy resistance, in BRCA1-related tumors and TNBCs21, 22, 31, 32, 47.
Thus, we hypothesize that vitamin D/VDR deficiency promotes malignancy by causing
DNA repair defects, while allowing the activation of mechanisms of therapy resistance.
Future studies need to determine if vitamin D treatment could represent a new strategy to
stabilize 53BP1 in the context of BRCA1 deficiency, restoring the sensitivity of specific
tumor cells to DNA-damaging strategies currently used in the clinic for cancer treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
Human foreskin (BJs) and lung (IMR90) fibroblasts expressing telomerase (hTERT) were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS+1% antibiotics/antimycotics.
Bleomycin treatment—Bleomycin was used to induce senescence of fibroblasts (BJ
+hTert). Cells were incubated with 100µg/ml Bleomycin for 24 hours in complete medium.
Bleomycin was then removed by extensive washing with PBS, and cells were grown for 72
hours in complete medium, and collected for different assays.

Author Manuscript

H2O2 treatment—Hydrogen Peroxide was used to induce senescence of fibroblasts (BJ
+hTert). Cells were incubated with 500µM H2O2 for 1 hour in complete medium, washed
extensively in PBS, and cultured in complete medium for 4 days. Cells were then treated
with 200µM H2O2 for 2 hours, washed with PBS and cultured for additional 4–6 days. After
two weeks from the first treatment cells were collected and processed for different assays.
Hydroxyurea treatment—Cells were grown in complete medium supplemented with
600µM HU (or vehicle), freshly replaced every two days. After two weeks from the first
treatment cells were collected and processed for different assays.

Author Manuscript

Vitamin D treatment—In all the cases, the active form of Vitamin D, 1α,25dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Sigma-Aldrich), was administrated to cells. Aliquots of 1nmol 1,25D
were re-suspended in 500µl FBS and diluted to 100nM in DMEM supplemented with FBS at
a final concentration of 10−7M. Short treatment: Ras-expressing cells at day 4 post-infection
were treated with 1,25D for 48 or 72 hours, replacing fresh 1,25D-containing medium daily.
Prolonged treatment: 1,25D was administrated to cells concomitantly with the expression of
oncogenic Ras, replacing fresh 1,25D-containing medium every two days.
Ionizing radiation—For assessing the ability of Ras-senescent cells to form DNA-repair
foci, cells were irradiated with 3Gy and fixed and processed for immunofluorescence 3 or 6
hours post-irradiation to monitor 53BP1 and BRCA1 IRIF foci formation, respectively. As
control for DNA damage, γH2AX IRIF were monitored at both time points as well. For the

time course experiment of DNA-repair foci formation/dissolution, cells were irradiated with
1Gy and fixed at different time points (1–24 hours) post-irradiation.
Constructs and Viral Transduction
Retroviral and lentiviral transductions were performed as previously described24. Details in
supplemental information.
Senescence markers
To monitor senescence, we performed analyses of cell cycle profile, positivity for SA-β-Gal
activity, presence of SAHF, and expression of cyclin A and p21. Assays are described in
detail in supplemental information.
Proliferation assay

Author Manuscript

To monitor rate of proliferation, cells were plated in triplicate at 500,000 cells/10-cm plate
and counted every two days utilizing Trypan Blue Viability Assay on the Nexcelom
Cellometer Vision CBL. To extrapolate proliferation to the respective time periods, we used
the equation Nf=Noekt, where Nf is the final number of cells, No is the starting number of
cells, k is ln2/DT (doubling time), and t is time in days. For each period we calculated the
doubling time and used it to estimate the number of cells (Nf) that would result from initially
plating 500,000 (N0) and culturing them for a given period of time.
Immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and qRT-PCR
These were performed using standard protocols described before14, 29, 46. Details in
supplemental information.

Author Manuscript

HR assays
HR was measured in MCF7-pDR-GFP cells by flow cytometry as described61
Microscopy
Microscopy and photo capture was performed on a Leica DM5000 B microscope using 40×
or 63× oil objective lenses with a Leica DFC350FX digital camera and the Leica
Application Suite (Version 4.1.0).
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

A standard “two-tailed” student’s t-test was used to calculate statistical significance of the
observed differences between two independent samples. When comparisons were made
among more than two samples, we used one-way ANOVA. All graphs show average±sem of
at least 3 biological repeats. GraphPad Prism 6 was used for the calculations. Differences
were considered statistically significant when p<0.05.

Figure 6. 53BP1 depletion rescues growth arrest in VDR-depleted cells

Author Manuscript

(A) MCF-7 cells carrying an HR reporter construct (DR-GFP) were lentivirally transduced
with shRNA targeting VDR or shRNA control (shscr). We monitored the percentage of
GFP-positive cells resulting from HR of I-SceI-induced DSBs by FACS in 4 independent
experiments. Note how depletion of VDR (immunoblotting) results in decreased HR
efficiency. (B) BJ+hTert fibroblasts were depleted of 53BP1 via lentiviral transduction with
specific shRNA (sh53BP1) prior to depletion of VDR (shVDR). Hairpins shscr and shLuc
were used as control for the depletions. After dual selection, cells were processed for
immunoblotting to monitor the levels of BRCA1, VDR, and 53BP1. Vinculin was used as
loading control. (C) Percentage of cells positive for SA-β-Gal activity was calculated 6 days
after the second lentiviral transduction with shRNAs. Graph shows average±sem of 2
biological repeats. (D) Proliferation of the different cell lines generated was evaluated by
counting cells days 2–11 after dual selection, as described in methods. The graph shows
average±sem of 4 biological repeats. Note how depletion of 53BP1 prevents growth arrest in
VDR-depleted cells (Day 11, *p=0.001).

Figure 7. Vitamin D (1,25D) treatment rescues the levels VDR and DNA repair factors during
Ras-induced senescence

(A) Oncogenic Ras-expressing cells in the senescence phase were treated with 1,25D (100
nM) or vehicle control for 48 or 72 hours, and collected for analysis by immunoblotting. The
levels of DNA repair factors, VDR, CTSL, Ras, and cell cycle regulators were monitored.
Note how 1,25D treatment partially rescues the levels of BRCA1 and 53BP1, while
stabilizing VDR. The experiment is representative of 4 biological repeats. (B) qRT-PCR
shows decreased levels of BRCA1 transcripts in Ras-senescent cells, which are rescued by

shows average±sem of 4 independent experiments. (C) 1,25D treatment of BJ+hTert
fibroblasts was initiated concomitant with retroviral transduction with oncogenic Ras or
empty vector control. Samples were collected 6, 8, and 10 days after viral transduction and
processed for immunoblotting to monitor Ras and VDR expression. Vinculin was the
loading control. Note how 1,25D treatment restores normal levels of VDR in Ras-expressing
cells. (D) The same experimental protocol as in (C), followed by monitoring of cell cycle
profile. Graph shows average of 5 independent experiments. (E) The same experimental
protocol as in (C), followed by quantitation of percentage of SA-β-Gal positive cells.
Representative images of SA-β-Gal staining are shown from 2 biological repeats.

Figure 9. Model of functional relationship between vitamin D/VDR axis and DNA repair factors
during Ras-induced senescence

We propose a model whereby the vitamin D/VDR signaling axis affects DNA repair
capabilities by regulating the expression of DNA repair factors during OIS. (A) Expression
of oncogenic Ras in human primary fibroblasts results in up-regulation of the cysteine
protease CTSL, which in turn is responsible for the degradation of 53BP1 protein during
OIS. In addition, oncogenic Ras expression leads to down-regulation of VDR, which in turn
contributes to a reduction in BRCA1 expression. VDR deficiency and loss of DNA repair

factors during OIS could contribute to the genomic instability that drives senescence bypass
and cellular transformation over time. (B) Vitamin D (1,25D) treatment increases VDR
expression, as previously reported in other contexts30. Increased vitamin D/VDR signaling
results in up-regulation of BRCA1 expression and inhibition of CTSL-mediated degradation
of 53BP1, as reported25. As a consequence, vitamin D treatment rescues DNA repair defects
in senescent cells. Maintaining vitamin D/VDR levels could ameliorate the occurrence of
secondary hits in the genome that promote senescence bypass and malignant transformation.
