ABSTRACT
Epidemiological studies have provided controversial evidence of the association
between dietary fatty acids intake and endometrial cancer risk. The continuous
update project of World Cancer Research Fund failed to focus on this issue. To
address this inconsistency, we conducted this dose-response meta-analysis based
on epidemiological studies published up to the end of June 2015 identified from
PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science. Two authors independently performed the
eligibility evaluation and data extraction. Random-effects models were used to
estimate summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Fourteen
epidemiological studies (4 cohort and 10 case-control studies) were included in
this dose-response meta-analysis. The summary RR for an intake increment of
10g/day was 1.02 (95% CI = 0.97–1.08; I 2 = 66.0%) for saturated fatty acids,
0.98 (95% CI = 0.96–1.001; I 2 = 0%) for monounsaturated fatty acids, and 1.00
(95% CI  =  0.95–1.06; I 2 = 0%) for polyunsaturated fatty acids intake. Nonsignificant results were observed in the majority of subgroup analyses stratified
by study characteristics and adjustment for potential confounders in analyses of
aforementioned associations. In conclusion, results from this dose-response metaanalysis provided limited evidence that dietary saturated, monounsaturated, and
polyunsaturated fatty acids consumption was associated with endometrial cancer
risk. Further studies, especial prospective designed or pooled studies are warranted
to confirm our findings.

to the etiology of EC because diet might be an important
difference of lifestyle of these countries [2].
In vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that
dietary fat and fatty acids (FA) intake have been proposed
to influence EC risk by modulating the production,
metabolism, and excretion of endogenous hormones [3–7].
However, the continuous update project of World Cancer
Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research
(WCRF/AICR) including studies up to December 2012
only investigated the association between total dietary fat
intake and EC risk which indicated limited evidence [8].
The relationships between dietary different FA (saturated,
monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FA) intake and risk
of EC have remained inconsistent and elusive which were

INTRODUCTION
About 320,000 new cases of endometrial cancer
(EC) were diagnosed and nearly 76,000 deaths from
this disease occurred worldwide in 2012 [1]. By
comparison with Africa and South Asia, the incidence
rates of this disease were higher in North America and
Europe [1]. Nonetheless, this discrepancy could not be
totally attributed to these well established risk factors
including obesity, reproductive factors (e.g., parity, age at
menarche), and use of exogenous hormones (e.g., estrogen
hormonal replacement therapy, oral contraceptives) [2].
During the past decade, experimental and epidemiological
studies have suggested that dietary factors may contribute

not summarized in this updated report [7–20]. In 2007, a
meta-analysis including 7 studies (one cohort and 6 casecontrol studies) showed a relative risk (RR) of 1.49 (95%
confidence interval (CI) = 1.11–2.01, I 2 = 52.7%, P for
heterogeneity = 0.06) for the highest compared with the
lowest intakes of dietary saturated FA [21]. However,
the results were hard to interpret because the definitions
of the categories differed among each study [21]. During
the recent five years, the findings from one of the largest
population-based cohort studies, the European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) found
non-significant result of saturated and polyunsaturated
FA but suggested significant result of monounsaturated
FA intake with EC risk [9]. In contrast, the Nurses' Health
Studies (NHS/NHSII) updated their evidence but found
non-significant association between monounsaturated
FA intake and EC risk [9]. Additionally, to our knowledge,
a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of the
relationship between dietary FA intake and EC risk has not
been reported. Therefore, we carried out this dose-response
meta-analysis of epidemiological studies to assess the
aforementioned associations.

occur’, all cohort studies were assigned a score except
one study [16] because the mean follow-up period was
less than 10 years. For the category of ‘using an energyadjusted model’, one study [7] failed to carry out it in
their analysis (Table 2). Furthermore, for the category of
‘selection of control subjects’, four case-control studies
[12–14, 19] were not assigned a score because the controls
of their study were not from populations; For the category
of ‘control for important factor or additional factor’, all
case-control studies were assigned two scores except
one study [19] because they adjusted for less than two
important confounders in their multivariable analysis; For
the category of ‘exposure assessment’, five case-control
studies [10, 13, 14, 17, 18] were assigned a score because
their FFQs were validated. Five-case-control studies
were assigned a score because there was no difference of
response rate between cases and controls [11,13,15,17,19].
Five case-control studies [10, 13–15, 18] were assigned
a score because they presented or considered energyadjusted model in their primary analyses (Table 3).

RESULTS

Thirteen studies [7, 9–20] were included in the doseresponse meta-analysis of saturated FA intake and EC
risk (Table 4). The summary RR for a 10g/day increase
was 1.02 (95%CI = 0.97–1.08), with high heterogeneity
(I 2 = 66.0%, P for heterogeneity < 0.01) (Figure 2).
No evidence of a potential nonlinear aforementioned
association was observed (P for nonlinearity = 0.18).
There was no indication of publication bias by visual
inspection of the funnel plot (Figure 3) as well as by
Egger’s test (P for bias = 0.18) and Beggʼs test (P for bias
= 0.30).
When stratified by study design, we found borderline
significant result in cohort study (RR = 0.97; 95%
CI = 0.93–1.00), with low heterogeneity (I 2 = 15.3%, P for
heterogeneity = 0.31). However, the non-significant results
with high heterogeneity were observed in the majority
of other subgroup analyses (Table 4). Furthermore, the
results of meta-regression analyses did not show statistical
significance. In a sensitivity analysis of saturated FA
intake and EC risk, we sequentially removed one study at
a time and re-analyzed the data. The 13 study-specific RRs
ranged from a low of 1.01 (95% CI = 0.96–1.06, I 2 = 57%,
P for heterogeneity = 0.01) after omitting the study by
Littman et al [15] to a high of 1.04 (95% CI = 0.98–1.10,
I 2 = 61.4%, P for heterogeneity < 0.01) after omitting the
study by Jain et al [16].

Dose-response analysis of saturated FA intake

Search results, study characteristics, and quality
assessment
Figure 1 presented the detailed procedures of the
article search and screening. Briefly, the search strategy
retrieved 3638 articles: 1073 from PubMed, 1756 from
EMBASE, and 809 from Web of Science. Of these,
3609 articles were excluded after the first screening based
on abstracts or titles, leaving 29 articles for full-text
review. Among them, fifteen articles were further excluded
due to i) no usable risk estimates or 95%CIs were reported;
and ii) study population duplication. Overall, a total of 13
articles (14 studies) were included in the present metaanalysis [7, 9–20].
Table 1 demonstrated the characteristics of the
14 selected studies. These studies were published between
1993 and 2015 and involved a total of 7741 EC cases
and 583,892 non-cases. There were 4 cohort and 10 casecontrol studies. Of the 4 cohort studies, three were
conducted in North America and one in Europe. Of the
10 case-control studies, eight were conducted in North
America and two in Europe. Age adjusted risk estimates
could be determined for all studies. Risk measures were
also adjusted for body mass index (13 studies), total
energy intake (13 studies), parity (12 studies), hormone
replacement therapy (12 studies), oral contraceptive
use (11 studies), cigarette smoking (11 studies), and
menopausal status (9 studies).
The information of study quality assessment is
demonstrated in Table 2 and Table 3. Briefly, for the

In a sensitivity analysis of monounsaturated FA intake
and EC risk, we sequentially removed one study at a
time and re-analyzed the data. The 9 study-specific
RRs ranged from a low of 0.98 (95% CI = 0.95–1.00,
I 2 = 0%, P for heterogeneity = 0.64) after omitting the
study by Lucenteforte et al [13] to a high of 0.99 (95%
CI = 0.96–1.01, I 2 = 0%, P for heterogeneity = 0.81) after
omitting the study by Tzonou et al [19].

Dose-response analysis of polyunsaturated
FA intake

EC risk. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is
the first meta-analysis to report the relationship between
monounsaturated and polyunsaturated FA intake and
EC risk.
The present study is inconsistent with a previous
meta-analysis which suggested that dietary saturated
FA (summarized RR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.11–2.01,
I 2 = 52.7%) intake was associated with an increased
risk of EC [21]. However, this finding was based on the
highest comparing with the lowest category of intake,
which was hard to interpret because the definitions of the
categories differed among these studies. For example,
Potischman et al [20] reported the highest category (the
fourth quartile) of saturated FA intake was over 25g/day
in a population-based case-control study with 399 cases
and 296 controls. However, the amount of saturated FA
intake for the fourth quartile was over 37g/day with
same population-based case-control study design from
the same country [17].
Our meta-analysis has several strengths. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first dose-response
meta-analysis systematically and quantitatively
evaluates the association between dietary saturated,
monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FA intake and
risk of EC. Moreover, compared with the previous metaanalysis [21], with six additional studies (two cohorts
and four case-controls studies), our meta-analysis
included a total of 7741 EC cases and 583,892 non-cases
which provided sufficient statistical power to detect
this putative association. Notably, we also carried out
numerous subgroup and sensitivity analyses in this doseresponse meta-analysis.

Eight studies [7, 9, 10, 12–14, 17, 19] were
included in the dose-response meta-analysis of
polyunsaturated FA intake and EC risk (Table 4). The
summary RR for a 10g/day increase was 1.00 (95%
CI = 0.95–1.06), without heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%,
P for heterogeneity  = 0.46) (Figure  6). No evidence
of a potential nonlinear aforementioned association
was observed (P for nonlinearity = 0.14). There was
no indication of publication bias by visual inspection
of the funnel plot (Figure 7) as well as by Egger’s test
(P for bias = 0.17) and Beggʼs test (P for bias = 0.71).
When stratified by study characteristics and
adjustment for potential confounders, the non-significant
results were observed in all the subgroups (Table 4). The
results of meta-regression analyses did not show statistical
significance. In a sensitivity analysis of polyunsaturated FA
intake and EC risk, we sequentially removed one study at
a time and re-analyzed the data. The 8 study-specific RRs
ranged from a low of 0.99 (95% CI = 0.93–1.06, I 2 = 0%,
P for heterogeneity = 0.47) after omitting the study by Cui
et al [7] to a high of 1.03 (95% CI = 0.96–1.01, I 2 = 0%, P
for heterogeneity = 0.56) after omitting the study by Merritt
et al [9].

One star was assigned if there was no significant difference in the response rate between control subjects and cases by
using the chi-square test (P > 0.05).

Despite the clear strengths of this study, some
limitations of our study should be acknowledged.
First, a meta-analysis is not able to solve problems
with confounding factors that could be inherent in
the included studies. Intake of diets high in FA may
be associated with overweight and obesity, cigarette
smoking and alcohol drinking, physical activity, and
intake of total energy and other nutrients, which possibly
could confound the aforementioned associations.
Although the results for dietary FA intake persisted in
studies that adjusted for these potential confounders,
less of studies adjusted for alcohol drinking (n = 1) [11]
and physical activity (n  =  3) [11, 13, 14]. Therefore,
we did not show these results which were difficult to
interpret. Furthermore, since EC was a hormone-related
cancer, we carried out the subgroup analyses stratified
by adjustment for hormone-dependent risk factors
(e.g., parity, oral contraceptive use, and hormone
replacement therapy). The majority of included studies
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

adjusted for these aforementioned confounders in
their primary analyses. Additionally, the results of
meta-regression analyses found no evidence that these
findings differed significantly between studies adjusted
for these confounders or not. Second, measurement
errors in the assessment of dietary intake are known
to bias effect estimates [22]; although all included
studies evaluated the dietary intake through food
frequency questionnaire (FFQ), none of them made any
corrections for measurement errors. Any measurement
errors would most likely result in bias toward the null,
which underestimate the relationship between dietary FA
intake and EC risk. Moreover, because the estimation of
dietary FA intake was based on the FFQ which might
vary among these include studies. For example, the
FFQ of the EPIC contained up to 260 food items [9]. In
contrast, Yeh et al [12] measure the dietary intake on the
basis of 44-item FFQ in a hospital-based case-control
study. Third, although the meta-regression analyses did

monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FA was associated
with the risk of EC. Since few prospective studies were
included, the findings of this study are warranted to be
confirmed. Additionally, further studies are needed to
provide more detail results, including those for other type
of dietary FA and stratify the results by the histology of
EC after better adjustment for the potential confounding.

not show statistical significance, the point estimates
were slightly different between cohort and case-control
studies (0.98 vs. 1.06), which could be partly attributed
to the methodological differences in study designs.
Compared with case-control studies, prospective studies
are less susceptible to bias (e.g. recall bias, selection
bias) due to their nature. Additionally, on the basis of
the updated NOS, less case-control studies fulfilled
these criteria than cohort studies (Table 2 and Table 3).
Therefore, further prospective studies are warranted to
confirm our findings. Last, since women who have had a
hysterectomy are at virtually no risk of developing EC,
none of the studies updated hysterectomy status of their
population during follow-up which might bias results
toward the null [21].
In summary, our dose-response meta-analysis
provides limited evidence that dietary intake of saturated,

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Search strategy
Two independent investigators (Q-JW and T-TG)
systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of
Science from each database’s inception to the end of June,
2015 to identify relevant epidemiological studies. The
following search keywords were used: (diet OR dietary

OR fat OR fatty OR fatty acid) AND (endometrium OR
endometrial) AND (cancer OR tumor OR carcinoma
OR neoplasm). This search strategy was similar to
previous studies [23–25]. We followed the preferred
reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines to plan, conduct and report this
meta-analysis [26].

estimates without 95% CIs); and (iii) reported the outcome
as EC mortality or recurrence [23].

Data extraction and quality assessment
Data were extracted by two investigators (Q-JW
and T-TG) using a data extraction form and entered into
a database. All differences were resolved by discussion
with third investigator (Y-ZW). For each included study,
we extracted the following information: last name of the
first author, publication year, geographic location, number
of cases/controls (size of cohort), exposure assessment
and categories, and study-specific adjusted estimates
with their 95% CIs for the highest compared with the
lowest category of intake (including adjusted confounders
information if applicable). If there were multiple estimates
for the association, we used the estimate adjusted for the
most appropriate confounding variables, like previous
studies [23, 27–29].
An update Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)
[23, 29–31] uses four quality parameters including
selection, comparability, exposure/outcome, and energyadjusted model was used to assess the methodological
quality of all included studies. The full score was 10 and

Study selection and exclusion
To be included in this analysis, a study must
have (i) an observational study design; (ii) evaluated
the association between dietary FA (saturated,
monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FA) intake and
EC risk; and (iii) presented RR, odds ratio (OR), or
hazard ratio (HR) estimates with 95% CIs or necessary
data for calculation [23]. If several publications involved
overlapped individuals, we included the study with the
most patients.
The studies were excluded by the following
exclusion criteria: (i) were randomized controlled
trials, reviews without original data, ecological studies,
editorials, and case reports; (ii) reported the risk estimates
that could not be summarized (such as reported the risk

geographic location (North America versus Europe),

mean number of EC cases (≥450 versus < 450),

for potential confounders including total energy
intake, body mass index, cigarette smoking, parity, oral
contraceptive use, menopausal status, and hormone
replacement therapy use. Heterogeneity between
subgroups was evaluated by meta-regression [23,29–31].
Small study bias, such as publication bias can
reflect genuine heterogeneity, chance, or other reasons for
differences between small and large studies which was
evaluated with Egger's linear regression asymmetry test
[39] and Beggʼs rank-correlation test [40]. A P-value of
0.05 was used to determine whether significant publication
bias existed. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were
conducted by deleting each study in turn to reflect the
influence of individual data on the overall estimate. All
statistical analyses were performed with Stata (version 12;
StataCorp, College Station, TX).

the high-quality study was defined as a study with quality
scores ≥ 9.

Statistical analysis
As the absolute risk of EC is low and therefore we
interpreted all risk estimates as relative risk (RR) for
simplicity [23]. For study [9] reported aforementioned
associations on the basis of the EPIC as well as the
NHS/NHSII but in one article, we treated it as two
included studies. For study [19] did not provide
the adjusted risk estimate, we used the exposure
distribution of cases and controls to calculate the crude
risk estimate.
To examine the associations between the dietary
FA intake and EC risk, the summary RR with 95% CIs
were estimated by summarizing the risk estimates of each
study using the random effect models, which considered
both within- and between-study variation [32]. We
summarized the study-specific RR for each 10 g/day
increment in dietary FA intake. The study-specific trend
from the correlated log RR across the categories of dietary
FA intake was computed by using the generalized leastsquares trend estimation method developed by Greenland
and Longnecker [33] and Orsini et al [34]. For studies
reported the risk estimates as per standard deviation (SD)
increment of total FA intake, we used previously described
methods [35, 36] to recalculate risk estimates into per
10g/day increment which was suggested by the continuous
update project of WCRF/AICR [8]. Furthermore, a
potential nonlinear dose-response relationship between
the dietary FA intake and the EC risk was modeled by
using restricted cubic splines with three knots at fixed
percentiles (10, 50 and 90%) of the distribution of
exposure. We calculated the overall P-value by testing
that these two regression coefficients were simultaneously
equal to zero. We calculated a P-value for nonlinearity by
testing that the coefficient of the second spline was equal
to zero. The details of this method has been published
elsewhere [37, 38].
For conducting the dose-response meta-analysis, the
following information were needed: (i) the distribution
of cases and non-cases and the risk estimates with
the variance estimates for at least three quantitative
exposure categories; (2) the median or mean level of
these exposures in each category (if reported by ranges,
mean level was calculated by averaging the lower and
upper bound; if the lowest category was open ended, the
lowest boundary was considered to be zero; if the highest
category was open ended, the open-ended interval length
was assumed to be the same as the adjacent interval).
Given this, thirteen, nine, and eight studies met the
criteria and were included in the dose-response analysis
of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FA
intake and EC risk, respectively.
To investigate the possible sources of heterogeneity
of main results, we carried out stratified analyses by the
