Abstract
Ovarian cancer frequently acquires resistance to platinum chemotherapy, representing a major challenge for
improving patient survival. Recent work suggests that resistant clones exist within a larger drug-sensitive cell
population prior to chemotherapy, implying that resistance is selected for rather than generated by treatment.
We sought to compare clinically derived, intrapatient paired models of initial platinum response and subsequent
resistant relapse to define molecular determinants of evolved resistance. Transcriptional analysis of a matched
cell line series from three patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer before and after development of clinical
platinum resistance (PEO1/PEO4/PEO6, PEA1/PEA2, PEO14/PEO23) identified 91 up- and 126 downregulated
genes common to acquired resistance. Significantly enhanced apoptotic response to platinum treatment in
resistant cells was observed following knockdown of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 4, FOLR2, PIK3R1, or STAT1
(P < 0.05). Interestingly, HDAC4 and STAT1 were found to physically interact. Acetyl-STAT1 was detected in
platinum-sensitive cells but not in HDAC4 overexpressing platinum-resistant cells from the same patient. In
resistant cells, STAT1 phosphorylation/nuclear translocation was seen following platinum exposure, whereas
silencing of HDAC4 increased acetyl-STAT1 levels, prevented platinum-induced STAT1 activation, and restored
cisplatin sensitivity. Conversely, matched sensitive cells were refractory to STAT1 phosphorylation on platinum
treatment. Analysis of 16 paired tumor biopsies taken before and after development of clinical platinum
resistance showed significantly increased HDAC4 expression in resistant tumors [n ¼ 7 of 16 (44%); P ¼ 0.04].
Therefore, clinical selection of HDAC4-overexpressing tumor cells upon exposure to chemotherapy promotes
STAT1 deacetylation and cancer cell survival. Together, our findings identify HDAC4 as a novel, therapeutically
tractable target to counter platinum resistance in ovarian cancer. Cancer Res; 71(13); 4412–22. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
One of the greatest areas of unmet need compromising the
successful treatment of ovarian cancer is the acquisition of
clinical resistance to platinum chemotherapy. Platinum-based
compounds are standard first-line agents for ovarian cancer
and initial response rates are high (1). However, subsequent

relapse with acquired platinum resistance is frequent and
closely linked to the poor survival associated with this cancer.
Multiple mechanisms for platinum resistance have been
described and are reviewed elsewhere (2–4).
A recent genomic analysis of a cell line series derived from 3
cases of serous ovarian cancer both before and after acquisition of clinical platinum resistance revealed that in addition to
shared genomic features, sensitive and resistant tumor cells
from the same patient also exhibit mutually exclusive genomic
characteristics, indicating that rather than a direct linear
evolution of resistance from sensitive disease in response
to platinum challenge, platinum-resistant clones are present
from the outset at low abundance within the sensitive presenting tumor (5). In this model, the minor resistant clone
persists despite effective killing of the dominant sensitive
population and subsequently expands causing relapse. This
is in contrast to alternative hypotheses of acquired resistance
whereby mutations are proposed to arise in sensitive cells in
response to treatment with chemotherapy. In vitro derivation
of acquired resistance by treatment of a sensitive cancer cell
line with platinum agents is likely to mimic this alternative
hypothesis producing adaptive linear responses, which may
not accurately reflect clinical resistance. As such, we focused

STAT1 and HDAC4 in Acquired Platinum Resistance

our analysis here on clinically derived models of resistance.
Henceforth, for brevity, we refer to this selection hypothesis as
acquired platinum resistance, as it describes the known
clinical entity of relapse within 6 months of last platinum
therapy after previous remission/response.
Here, we report the first linked gene expression profiling
and functional analysis of intrapatient paired pre- and postclinically acquired platinum resistance in ovarian cancer. Our
analysis used ovarian cancer cell line series described previously (5, 6), identifying several novel modulators of platinum
response and focuses on a previously unreported functional
mechanism that behaves in a fundamentally different manner
between clinically platinum-sensitive and -resistant cells from
the same patients. In addition, we noted that this mechanism
operates to produce resistance independently of pre-existing
established changes in platinum response caused by functional reversion of a germ line BRCA2 truncating mutation (7).
This work identifies therapeutic targets with implications for
the management of ovarian cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
The paired high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma cell lines
PEO1 versus PEO4/PEO6, PEA1 versus PEA2, and PEO14
versus PEO23 were obtained from Dr. Simon Langdon (Edinburgh, UK) and have been described elsewhere (5–7). Cell line
verification was by Identifyler kit (Applied Biosystems). In the
matched pairs, the first set of cell lines (PEO1, PEA1, PEO14)
were derived prior to and the second set (PEO4/PEO6, PEA2,
PEO23), following the onset of acquired clinical platinum
resistance. SKOV3 cells were obtained from European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (ECACC). Cisplatin response was
measured by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay as described (8).
All cell lines have confirmed TP53 mutations (5). BRCA1/2
sequencing was done as described (ref. 9; see also Supplementary Methods). All lines were maintained in RPMI 1640
media with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine at 37 C/5% CO2. Antibodies used were FOLR2
(Abcam); STAT1 (BD Biosciences); HDAC4, pSTAT1Y701,
Acetyl-Lys (Cell Signaling Technology); FAK, PIK3R1, Lamin
A/C (Upstate); b-tubulin and HDAC4 (for immunohistochemistry; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Microarray hybridization and data analysis
RNA was prepared using TriReagent (Sigma) and hybridized
to Sanger Hver1.2.1 10K cDNA microarrays as described elsewhere (ref. 10; see also Supplementary Methods), and data
analyzed using the Genespring GX Software Package (Aglient)
following lowess normalization and averaging of quadruplicate
hybridizations. Genes were filtered on the basis of expression
change between sensitive and resistant cells after which
Student's t tests were conducted with Benjamini–Hochberg
false discovery rate correction (see also Supplementary Fig. S2).
siRNA transfection and apoptosis assay
Cells were grown to 60% confluence in 6-well plates prior
to transfection with smartpool siRNAs directed to FAK,

www.aacrjournals.org

FOLR2, HDAC4, HSXIAPAF1, ITGB2, LAMA4, MYC, PIK3R1,
PRKCBP1, STAT1, TAP1, VEGFA and control siRNAs,
LAMIN A/C, nontargeting and siCONTROL-TOX (100
nmol/L final concentration; Dharmacon). Cells were
retransfected after 48 hours. The siRNAs in 1 siRNA buffer
were mixed with 2 mL transfection reagent #1 (Dharmacon)
per transfection in a total volume of 400 mL with OptiMEM
media. Following 30 minutes incubation, siRNAs were
added to 1,600 mL antibiotic-free RPMI 1640/10% FCS on
cells. Twenty-four hours after second transfection, cells
were reseeded. Cells reseeded in 6-well trays were incubated
for 48 hours and protein and RNA samples prepared. RNA
extraction was by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Cells reseeded
into clear and opaque 96-well trays were treated identically:
for each transfection condition, 24 hours after seeding, 3
replicate wells were treated with 25 mmol/L cisplatin and 3
wells left untreated. After 24 hours, cells caspase activation
was measured by caspaseGlo 3/7 assay (Promega) and
viable cell numbers inferred by MTT assay as described
elsewhere (11). Caspase activity was normalized to cell
density for each treatment.
Immunofluorescent microscopy
Coverslips (VWR International) were treated with 1 mol/L
HCl before cell seeding and incubation for 24 hours at 37 C/
5% CO2. After indicated treatment, cells were washed with PBS
then fixed/permeabilized at 37 C for 30 minutes with 4%
paraformaldehyde/1.8% TritonX-100/PBS. Coverslips were
blocked in 10% goat serum/2% bovine serum albumin
(BSA)/PBS for 30 minutes, then washed with PBS, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 C. Coverslips
were washed in PBS and incubated with 1:500 dilutions of
fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies [fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) anti-goat IgG, FITC anti-rabbit IgG,
Alexa Fluor 555 anti-mouse IgG, and Alexa Fluor 488 goat
anti-rabbit IgG; Invitrogen] and directly labeled actin stain
(Alexa Fluor 633 phalloidin; Invitrogen) in blocking buffer for 1
hour. Cells were rinsed 3 times in PBS for 5 minutes and
mounted onto slides using Vectashield media containing 40 ,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories). Slides
were visualized on an inverted confocal microscopy system
(Axiovert 200M, Zeiss and TCS SP5, Leica).
Pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC4
PEO4 and SKOV3 cells were seeded at 25,000 cells per well
in 96-well plates in a volume of 50 mL per well. After 24 hours,
cells were either treated with 40 mL of fresh culture media
(untreated control) or 40 mL fresh media containing HDAC
inhibitor (HDACi) aroyl-pyrrolyl-hydroxy-amide 4a (APHA4a)
at final concentration, calculated for 50 mL final volume, of 5
mmol/L and 10 mmol/L. After 1 hour, 10 mL of cisplatin was
added to a final concentration of 25 mmol/L in 50 mL; 10 mL of
fresh culture media was added to control cells. Caspase 3/7
and MTT assays were conducted at 24 hours post–cisplatin
treatment as described above.

Coupled gene expression and functional analysis of
upregulated transcripts in clinically acquired platinum
resistance
To confirm that acquired clinical resistance to platinumbased chemotherapy was maintained in long-term platinumfree cell culture, we carried out in vitro cisplatin sensitivity
assays (Fig. 1A). Average values from at least 3 replicate
experiments revealed a between 4- and 9-fold increase in
cisplatin IC50 values on acquisition of clinical resistance.
Stable resistance in the absence of cisplatin suggests that
clinical mechanisms of resistance are genetically or epigenetically determined: consistent with the description of distinct
genomic differences between the sensitive and resistant
paired lines studied here (5). Mutations in BRCA2 have been
described previously in the cell lines PEO1 and PEO4 (7). We
sequenced BRCA1 and BRCA2 in all paired cell lines and
identified previously described alterations in our stocks of
PEO1 and PEO4 that are associated with functional BRCA2
(discussed in detail in Supplementary Fig. S1). No further
mutations were seen in BRCA1 or BRCA2 in other cell lines
indicating that the clinical platinum resistance phenotype
here is not accounted for by BRCA mutation/reversion. RNAs
from cell line pairs were cohybridized to cDNA microarrays.
Normalized data were filtered as described identifying 91
unique upregulated and 126 downregulated genes in association with clinically acquired platinum resistance (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S1A and B). We
hypothesized that silencing of genes overexpressed in resistant cells might lead to resensitization by re-engaging apoptotic response to cisplatin treatment and thus may directly
reveal novel therapeutic targets for clinical reversal of resistance. Hence, the overexpressed genes formed the focus of our
onward strategy. Thirteen upregulated candidate genes were
selected on the basis of either magnitude of overexpression or
cellular function and were taken forward for functional assessment (Supplementary Table S2). We combined an siRNAbased approach, using the platinum-resistant PEO4 cell line,
to a caspase 3/7 activation–based apoptosis assay to evaluate
the effect of each gene on the cellular response to platinum. To
quantify the difference in platinum-induced apoptosis
between control and test genes, the ratio of caspase3/7
induction in control transfected cells on cisplatin treatment
was compared with that of target gene siRNA-transfected
cells. Six of the 13 genes showed a 1.5-fold or greater increase
in the ratio of caspase induction in the target gene siRNA
compared with the control gene siRNA (platinum resensitization ratio; Supplementary Table S2) and these were taken
forward for further analysis. Assays were repeated a further 3
times for these 6 genes and the average values plotted
(Fig. 1B). The platinum resensitization ratios were calculated
and averages subjected to Student's t test for statistical
significance (Table 1). Knockdown of control and test genes
was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). Four genes,
FOLR2, PIK3R1, HDAC4, and STAT1, emerged as significantly
resensitizing platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells. We
focused here on 2 of these genes, HDAC4 and STAT1, as recent

Figure 1. Identification of platinum resistance modulators. A, IC50 values
for platinum-sensitive and -resistant paired cell lines were calculated
based on SRB assay data (n ¼ 3). This analysis confirmed an in vitro
resistance to cisplatin in all clinically platinum-resistant cell lines relative to
their sensitive parent lines [fold changes in IC50 between sensitive and
matched resistant cells: PEO4-8.7 (P ¼ 0.016), PEO6-4.6 (P ¼ 0.004),
PEA2-4.1 (P ¼ 0.0002), PEO23-4.5 (P ¼ 0.00002)]. B, following microarraybased expression analysis, candidate genes were assessed for a role in
acquired platinum resistance by a first round of siRNA knockdown
followed by cisplatin treatment identifying 6 genes that enhanced
apoptotic induction by cisplatin. Following replication, 4 of these genes
[FOLR2 (P ¼ 0.004), HDAC4 (P ¼ 0.02), PIK3R1 (P ¼ 0.04), and STAT1
(P ¼ 0.0002)] passed statistical analysis (see also Table 1) as enhancing
apoptotic induction on cisplatin treatment when compared with control
siRNA treated cells. Data are represented as means  SEM of 4 replicate
experiments. C, specificity of siRNA was confirmed by Western blot. All
t tests throughout are 2-tailed and assume unequal variances.

reports indicate that the transcription factor STAT1 can be
regulated by acetyl modifications (12, 13) suggesting the
possibility that STAT1 may transcriptionally control the
switch from sensitivity to resistance in a manner that may
be modulated clinically using HDACi, which are well developed and indeed approved for use in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (14).
HDAC4 knockdown resensitizes a panel of clinically
derived platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines
We used quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and
Western blotting to validate the upregulation of HDAC4 seen
in the gene expression analysis (Fig. 2A). This indicated an
increase in expression between sensitive and resistant cells
in each pair tested. We showed that the effect seen in the 24hour caspase3/7 activation assay is maintained at 72 hours by
SRB assay following HDAC4 siRNA knockdown (Fig. 2B). We
then considered the effect of siRNA knockdown of HDAC4 in
the clinically derived platinum-resistant cell lines PEA2,
PEO23, and SKOV3. Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure
S4 show significantly increased apoptotic response to cisplatin
following siRNA knockdown of HDAC4, compared with control siRNAs. Conversely, silencing of HDAC4 expression in
sensitive cells (PEO1, PEA1, PEO14) did not significantly
enhance platinum sensitivity, in keeping with their already
relatively low HDAC4 expression levels (Supplementary
Fig. S3). However, overexpression of HDAC4 in platinumsensitive PEO1 cells resulted in decreased apoptotic response
to cisplatin (P ¼ 0.032) indicating that the platinum-resistant
phenotype can be, at least partially, recapitulated by overexpression of HDAC4 alone (Fig. 2D). Deconvolution of the
pool of 4 HDAC4 siRNAs confirmed target specific knockdown
(Supplementary Fig. S4B).

www.aacrjournals.org

Demonstration of a novel role for HDAC4 in acquired
platinum resistance led us to consider possible targets for
HDAC4-mediated deacetylation. Posttranslational modification of the transcription factor STAT1 by acetylation at lysine
residues 410 and 413 has been reported previously in melanoma cells (12) and shown to promote dephosphorylation at
tyrosine residue 701 (13) thereby acting as a control mechanism for this protein in the IFN response. Because STAT1 was
identified as upregulated in resistant cells in our analysis and
knockdown significantly resensitized cells to platinum (see
above), we considered that STAT1 might be subject to acetyl
regulation in acquired resistance and hence explored whether
a functional interaction occurs between HDAC4 and STAT1.
STAT1 is activated and translocated to the nucleus in
response to cisplatin treatment in acquired platinumresistant but not -sensitive ovarian cancer cells
We examined the broader role of STAT1 in platinum
resistance prior to more detailed mechanistic studies. STAT1
exists as 2 distinct isoforms, full-length STAT1a and STAT1b,
a truncated form considered to act as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of STAT1a. qRT-PCR in platinum-sensitive and
-resistant lines showed that both STAT1a and STAT1b were
upregulated to the same extent in the resistant lines (Fig. 3A),
suggesting that differences between isoforms did not explain
the alteration in platinum sensitivity.
Next, we carried out RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of
STAT1 in additional platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cell
lines: PEA2, PEO23, and SKOV3. Figure 3B and Supplementary
Figure S5A depict the enhanced apoptotic response following
STAT1 siRNA knockdown. Deconvolution of the pool of 4
siRNAs to STAT1 validated target-specific phenotype (Supplementary data Fig. S5B).
We explored whether STAT1 is activated in response to
cisplatin and thus examined the subcellular localization of
STAT1. Immunofluorescence microscopy of platinum-sensitive and matched, resistant cells showed that in the absence of
platinum, STAT1 is predominantly unphosphorylated and
cytoplasmic. However, nuclear STAT1, phosphorylated at
Y701, is observed following cisplatin treatment in resistant
cells (PEO4/PEA2) but not matched, sensitive cells (PEO1/
PEA1) where STAT1 remains largely unphosphorylated and
cytoplasmic (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S6A). This is in
keeping with the canonical pathway of STAT1 activation by
phosphorylation, dimerization and nuclear translocation and
suggests a platinum-induced, STAT1-mediated transcriptional response occurring specifically in acquired platinumresistant cells. To corroborate these findings, we also looked at
pSTAT1 Y701 levels in the sensitive and resistant cells by
Western blotting. Figure 3D shows striking discordance
between the phospho-STAT Y701 levels in the paired sensitive/resistant cell lines PEO1 and PEO4, with no detectable
Y701 phosphorylation in sensitive cells. In contrast, phosphoSTAT1 Y701 is detectable at baseline and is induced following
platinum treatment in PEO4 cells. Expression of the STAT1
regulated gene IRF1 was measured in platinum-resistant
PEO4 cells and showed cisplatin-mediated induction of
IRF1 transcription which was abolished by STAT1 knockdown

confirming functional activity of STAT1 in response to cisplatin exposure in resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B).
We hypothesized that if HDAC4 and STAT1 had independent roles in the platinum-resistant phenotype, we would
expect additivity or synergy in platinum resensitization if
both were inhibited simultaneously. Therefore, we carried
out dual knockdown of HDAC4 and STAT1 in resistant
PEO4 cells. Data indicated no additional effect in apoptotic
response to cisplatin over that seen following knockdown of
either gene alone (Fig. 4A), implying redundancy between
these 2 genes and supporting the notion that they may act
in the same pathway in this phenotype.

Having shown a clear role for STAT1 in platinum resistance,
we considered the hypothesis outlined above, that HDAC4
may be acting as a STAT1 deacetylase, altering the impact of
cisplatin on STAT1 signaling.
HDAC4 interacts with STAT1, modulating its
acetylation, phosphorylation, and nuclear
translocation, thereby abrogating sensitivity to
cisplatin
To assess STAT1 acetylation and the potential role of HDAC4
in STAT1 deacetylation, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation and showed an interaction between HDAC4 and STAT1 in

for the presence of acetyl-STAT1 (ac-STAT1) by immunoprecipitation with anti-acetyl lysine antibody and Western blotting for STAT1. Ac-STAT1 was present in the platinumsensitive cell lines PEO1 and PEA1 (expressing low levels of
HDAC4) but was undetectable in their HDAC4 overexpressing
matched platinum-resistant counterparts PEO4 and PEA2 and
was similarly undetectable in platinum-resistant SKOV-3 cells.
However, following HDAC4 knockdown, ac-STAT1 was detectable in all resistant lines (Fig. 4C) indicating that HDAC4 is

resistance. Next, we considered the consequence of HDAC4mediated deacetylation of STAT1 on its protein function and
on the phenotype of clinically acquired platinum resistance.
We hypothesized that because acetylation of STAT1 has
been shown to abrogate IFN-induced phosphorylation at Y701
(13), and that because the knockdown of HDCA4 has been
shown here to increase acetylation of STAT1, that HDAC4
may influence the phosphorylation, and hence nuclear accumulation, of STAT1. Figure 4D shows that the cisplatininduced accumulation of phospho-STAT1 observed in the
presence of HDAC4 is abrogated following HDAC4 knockdown in platinum-resistant PEO4, PEA2, and SKOV3 cells.

To consider the potential therapeutic utility of inhibiting
HDAC4 or STAT1, we treated-platinum resistant cells with the
hydroxamic acid–based HDACi APHA4a (15). This treatment
elicited a restoration of platinum sensitivity, as determined by
induction of caspase 3/7 activity, in the resistant cell lines PEO4

platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients matched to second
biopsies from the same patients subsequent to development
of acquired platinum resistance. In addition, we utilized
paired biopsies from 14 patients with platinum refractory
disease; those biopsies obtained before and after platinumbased chemotherapy. Sections were stained and scored,
blinded by 2 pathologists. Intensity of staining was scored
on a 0 to 3 scale and percentage cells stained scored on a 0 to 4
scale. The product score was derived and used for further
statistical analysis. This revealed an increase in HDAC4 protein expression in 7 of 16 (44%) acquired platinum-resistant
biopsies compared with their matched platinum-sensitive
biopsies (Fig. 6A and B; P ¼ 0.0413; Wilcoxon rank-sum test).
Interestingly, the analysis of 14 paired sections from patients
with platinum refractory disease revealed no increase in
HDAC4 expression between the paired biopsies taken before
and after ineffective first-line platinum treatment indicating
that upregulation of HDAC4 is specifically an acquired resistance mechanism and is not involved in refractory disease
(Supplementary Fig. S7). Clinical parameters are shown in
Supplementary Table S4. This analysis suggests that up to 44%
of patients with acquired platinum resistance may have an
HDAC4-mediated resistance pathway.

Discussion
Resistance to platinum chemotherapy continues to be a
major obstacle in the treatment of ovarian and other cancers.
A recent genomic analysis of the cell lines used in this study
has shown that resistance to platinum seems not to arise by
mutational adaptation of the sensitive tumor cells in the
presence of chemotherapy: rather the resistant cells are present in the initial prechemotherapy tumor as a minor population (5). The implication is therefore, that clinical mechanisms
of acquired resistance may not be recapitulated in vitro by
adaptive responses following exposure of homogeneous sensitive populations to chemotherapy. Mechanisms produced

in vitro may reflect the artificial environment of the monolayer
culture: a suggestion underscored by the lack of correlation
between gene expression changes detected in a cisplatinresistant cell line, PEO1cddp (16), produced in vitro from
sensitive PEO1 cells and those seen in the clinically derived
resistant PEO4 and PEO6 lines (r2 values: PEO1cddp vs. PEO4
¼ 0.25; PEO1cddp vs. PEO6 ¼ 0.23; PEO4 vs. PEO6 ¼ 0.81;
Supplementary Fig. S8). Interestingly, most in vitro derived
platinum-resistant cell lines require periodic retreatment with
platinum to maintain resistance, indicating that the mechanisms affecting drug response are transient and adaptive rather
than being genomically established. Conversely, the clinically
derived resistant cell lines used here exhibit stable platinum
resistance in vitro, implying that the genomic differences
reported between sensitive and resistant cells from the same
patient (5) are likely to underpin the resistant phenotype. Such
alterations between these cell line pairs are extensive, however, and preclude efficient identification of resistance
mechanisms by DNA-level candidate selection. We therefore
used transcriptional profiling to indicate changes in gene
activity relating to acquired resistance.
Gene expression profiling has been used previously to
attempt identification of better predictive biomarkers for
clinically acquired platinum resistance and novel targets for
therapy and has been applied to clinical material (17–19) and
cell lines (20, 21). Jazaeri and colleagues identified expression
changes related to chemoresistance and, although underpowered for statistical significance, suggested that distinct
mechanisms may be responsible for intrinsic and acquired
chemoresistance, as we have also indicated here (17). Spentzos and colleagues developed a 93-gene signature predictive of
response to platinum-based chemotherapy (18). Helleman and
colleagues identified a set of 9 genes, predictive of intrinsic
platinum resistance. These studies were focused on frozen
clinical samples and as such were correlative rather than
functional; however, they suggest that gene expression measurements are informative in this context (19). Cheng and
colleagues compared global gene expression levels between
isogenically matched, platinum-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer cell line pairs (21). The analysis identified a number
of dysregulated genes; however, no functional validation was
reported. Of note, the platinum-resistant cell lines used were
not clinically derived but were created by in vitro exposure of
sensitive cells to cisplatin (21).
Our analysis identified 4 genes, HDAC4, STAT1, FOLR2, and
PIK3R1 as overexpressed in clinically resistant cells, each of
which also significantly potentiated cisplatin response when
knocked down by siRNA. We were prospectively interested in
whether our approach would identify unrelated mechanisms
or common pathways of acquired resistance. It is of note that
by using this discovery-based approach, we identified a novel
relationship between HDAC4 and STAT1 whereby they physically interact to create conditions under which STAT1 can be
activated following cisplatin treatment in cells with acquired
clinical platinum resistance but not in matched sensitive cells
from the same patient. As a surrogate of this resistancespecific activation, we observed phosphorylation and nuclear
translocation of STAT1 upon platinum treatment in resistant

4420

Cancer Res; 71(13) July 1, 2011

cells only. We showed that overexpression of HDAC4 promotes deacetylation of STAT1 which facilitates STAT1 phosphorylation at Y701 and its subsequent nuclear translocation.
In contrast, matched cisplatin-sensitive cells have lower endogenous HDAC4 levels and readily detectable ac-STAT1: consequently, cisplatin treatment is unable to induce
phosphorylation of STAT1 (Y701) or STAT1 nuclear relocalization (model summarized in Supplementary Fig. S9).
The role of HDACs in deacetylation of nonhistone proteins
is not a new concept. HDAC6, a class IIb HDAC found
exclusively in the cytoplasm, deacetylates tubulin, contractin,
and Hsp90 affecting cell morphology, adhesion, and migration
(22). A sumoylation/acetylation cross-talk has been described
for p53 that affects the transcriptional activity of this tumor
suppressor (23), whereas activity of the FOXO proteins, downstream targets of AKT, can be modulated by p300/CBPmediated acetylation and deacetylation by the class III HDAC,
SIRT1 (24). Kramer and colleagues reported acetylation of
STAT1 at K410 and K413 in melanoma cells and showed
increased acetylation following HDAC inhibition or IFN-a
treatment (12) although, HDAC4 was not analyzed in their
study. Following activation at the cell surface, nuclear translocation of STAT1 occurs which has been reported to follow
binding of STAT1 to importin-a5 via critical K410 and K413
(25, 26): the same residues as identified by Kramer and
colleagues as the acetyl sites on STAT1 (12). This suggests
a potential interference with the nuclear import machinery in
platinum-sensitive cell lines shown here to have constitutively
acetylated STAT1 and to remain in the cytoplasm following
platinum treatment (Figs. 3C and 4C). Subsequent to their
report of acetyl control of STAT1 (12), Kramer and colleagues
described a cyclical control system whereby phosphorylated,
nuclear STAT1 is acetylated by the histone acetyl transferase
CBP marking it for subsequent dephosphorylation by the
phosphatase TCP45 resulting in decreased DNA binding
and target gene transcription (13). Deacetylation by HDAC3
and nuclear–cytoplasmic translocation returns STAT1 to a
latent cytoplasmic state in readiness for reactivation by subsequent IFN stimulation (13, 27). Our data suggest a similar
but distinct set of effects. In contrast to previous studies,
which identified the involvement of the class I HDACs, HDAC1
and HDAC3 in STAT1 deacetylation, we identify the class II
deacetylase, HDAC4, as having a key role in the cisplatinmediated activation of STAT1, specifically in platinum-resistant cells that overexpress this HDAC. Importantly, we see that
in both platinum-sensitive and -resistant lines, IFN treatment
induces strong phosphorylation of STAT1 Y701 despite the
observed differences in basal STAT1 acetylation levels
between those platinum-sensitive and -resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. S10). In contrast, we only see STAT1 Y701
phsophorylation in response to cisplatin treatment in resistant lines. Our data indicate that both sensitive and resistant
cells activate STAT1 in response to IFN-g (Supplementary
Fig. S10); however, only resistant cells activate STAT1 in
response to cisplatin-induced DNA damage (Fig. 3D), suggesting that this effect is not mediated via IFN-g.
The work presented here shows a novel mechanism involving HDAC4 and places this interaction at the centre of the

STAT1 and HDAC4 in Acquired Platinum Resistance

response to platinum chemotherapy revealing clinically relevant phenotypic differences resulting from within-patient
changes in HDAC4 gene expression. Our data indicate that
an HDAC4 threshold level exists that creates a dichotomous
STAT1 response that differentiates clinical platinum sensitivity from acquired clinical platinum resistance. Pharmacologic
and clinical data (Figs. 5 and 6) suggest that this mechanism
may be a frequent event and can be targeted to reverse
resistance using HDACi, many of which are either in or near
the clinic. It further suggests that HDAC4/class II HDACi may
be more appropriate than pan-HDACi in this indication, with
potentially lower toxicity/nonspecificity. This has implications for management of platinum-resistant disease, as a
relatively modest reduction in HDAC4 can cause resistant
cells to behave like their sensitive parental cells with respect to
both the control of STAT1 and the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin. HDAC4 has not previously been shown to functionally
modulate clinically acquired resistance to platinum-based
treatment.
Although STAT1 is most commonly associated with proapoptotic signaling, it is also associated with cell survival in
certain contexts. STAT1 is relocalized to the nucleus of breast
cancer cells following doxorubicin treatment and is associated
with increased apoptotic response (28) and enhances apoptotic response to DNA damage in mouse fibroblasts via downregulation of mdm2, a negative regulator of p53 (29).
Conversely, STAT1 can induce docetaxel resistance in prostate
cancer cells (30) and cisplatin resistance in A2780 ovarian
cancer cells (20). Roberts and colleagues carried out expression profiling of ovarian cancer cell lines with predefined
response to a number of chemotherapeutics (20). Gene expression was correlated with drug IC50 values across the cell lines
used and this identified an association between STAT1 and
response to cisplatin and AMD473. Overexpression of STAT1
by transfection was shown to increase resistance to both
agents; however, inhibition of upstream Janus kinase by
treatment with AG490 (31) increased sensitivity to AMD473
but not cisplatin, perhaps suggesting that cisplatin-mediated
activation of STAT1 may be independent of Janus-activated
kinase (JAK) 2/3. The study included the cell line pair PEO1
and PEO4, however, interestingly the analysis did not take
advantage of the matched nature of these lines. Our study
shows that the behavior of STAT1 can differ fundamentally,
even within a single patient's tumor before and after the onset
of clinical resistance to platinum, thus highlighting the importance of the cellular context in understanding STAT1
responses following stimulus.
In summary, we have shown that molecular profiling of
appropriate, clinically derived model systems coupled to

functional assays can reveal novel biological mechanisms
underlying acquired platinum resistance. The identification
of an HDAC4-mediated STAT1 response "switch" represents a
novel mechanism of in vivo acquired platinum resistance that
is demonstrably amenable to therapeutic modulation and can
result in resensitization to platinum-based chemotherapy.
The recent report that platinum-resistant clones exist within
the platinum-sensitive presenting tumor also raises the possibility of therapeutically targeting these cells in front-line
therapy to increase survival and/or delay the onset of resistance. Further work will determine the most appropriate
predictive biomarker(s) for identifying patients who might
benefit from this approach. Drug development and clinical
trials around HDAC4 or STAT1 inhibition will address the
therapeutic potential of re-engaging response to platinumbased treatment in resistant cells by disrupting this specific
mechanism in ovarian and potentially other platinum-treated
cancers. Further work is required to identify the downstream
mechanistic functions of STAT1 that confer this resistant
phenotype and to further integrate this novel mechanism
in the context of other parallel signaling changes in acquired
resistance identified here and elsewhere. In addition, it
remains unclear how platinum-induced DNA damage leads
to STAT1 activation. A comprehensive screen of ligands,
receptors, and associated kinases (JAKs and others) in the
context of platinum treatment would help to address this
question. Establishment of a system-level understanding of
acquired platinum resistance will allow us to better predict
the behavior of each tumor and identify rational means of
targeting it for re-engagement of apoptotic response to platinum chemotherapy.
