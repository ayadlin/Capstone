ABSTRACT
Stag3, a meiosis-specific subunit of cohesin complex, has been demonstrated
to function in both male and female reproductive systems in mammals. However,
its roles during oocyte meiotic maturation have not been fully defined. In the
present study, we report that Stag3 uniquely accumulates on the spindle apparatus
and colocalizes with microtubule fibers during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation.
Depletion of Stag3 by gene-targeting morpholino disrupts normal spindle assembly
and chromosome alignment in oocytes. We also find that depletion of Stag3
reduces the acetylated level of tubulin and microtubule resistance to microtubule
depolymerizing drug, suggesting that Stag3 is required for microtubule stability.
Consistent with these observations, kinetochore-microtubule attachment, an
important mechanism controlling chromosome alignment, is severely impaired
in  Stag3-depleted oocytes, resultantly causing the significantly increased
incidence of aneuploid eggs. Collectively, our data reveal that Stag3 is a novel
regulator of microtubule dynamics to ensure euploidy during moue oocyte meiotic
maturation.

are composed of α- and β-tubulin dimers that make a
highly dynamic state between rapid growth and shrinkage.
Disruption of this dynamics would cause increased or
decreased microtubule stability, which thereby results in
defective spindle structures [10]. Faithful chromosome
segregation depends on the sister chromatid cohesion
mediated by a complex named cohesin, which has the
ability to hold two DNA segments together within its ringshaped structure until the onset of anaphase, when cohesin
is cleaved and chromosome segregation is initiated [11–
13]. Although numerous studies have been focused on the
mechanisms regarding how cohesin and its regulators play
essential roles in chromosome segregation, transcriptional
regulation and DNA damage repair, the more biological
processes involved remain to be explored.
Stag3, Rec8 and Smc1β are three core meiosisspecific versions of cohesin subunits, which are essential
for proper pairing and segregation of chromosomes in
meiosis [14, 15, 16]. Recent studies have shown that Stag3
is involved in maintaining the stability of all meiosis-

INTRODUCTION
Cells divide and reproduce in two ways: mitosis and
meiosis. During mitosis, chromosomes have to replicate
and the resulting sister chromatids have to segregate in
each cell cycle, which generates two genetically identical
daughter cells [1, 2]. On the other hand, male and female
germ cells both undergo two rounds of meiotic cell
divisions (meiosis I and II) during their development in
order to reduce the ploidy, and this process generates
the formation of haploid gametes, each possessing half
the number of chromosomes of the original cells [3, 4].
Errors in meiosis resulting in aneuploidy contribute
to miscarriage, the age-related infertility, and the high
incidence of genetic disorders such as Down's syndrome
in humans [5, 6, 7, 8].
The major causes of these errors are mainly due
to the deficient structure of spindles and segregation of
chromosomes [9]. Correct spindle assembly depends on
the speedy reorganization of dynamic microtubules which

specific cohesin complexes, and changing the structures
of chromosomes that mediate chromosome pairing and
synapsis, DNA repair and progression of meiosis [17].
Both Stag3-deficient male and female mice are infertile
due to the early prophase I arrest and apoptosis in both
male and female germ cells. Stag3-deficient females
show a lack of ovarian follicles indicating a severe
ovarian dysgenesis [18, 19]. In addition, the wholeexome sequencing in a large consanguineous family with
inherited premature ovarian failure (POF) has identified
a homozygous frameshift mutation in the STAG3 gene
leading to a premature stop codon [20]. Despite the very
important recent progress, the functions of Stag3 during
mouse oocyte meiotic maturation are still not fully defined.
Here, we identify the meiosis-specific subunit of
cohesin complex Stag3 as a novel regulator of microtubule
dynamics during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. We
show that Stag3 specifically localizes on the spindle
apparatus and is required for microtubule stability and
spindle assembly. In addition, Stag3 plays an important
role in proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments to

maintain the euploidy in the mouse eggs, and this role is
beyond the sister chromatid cohesion.

RESULTS
Stag3 localizes on the microtubule fibers during
mouse oocyte meiosis
The subcellular localization of Stag3 in various
developmental stages of mouse oocytes was examined by
the immunofluorescent staining. As shown in Figure 1A,
in oocytes that just underwent GVBD (Germinal Vesicle
Breakdown), with the formation of microtubules, Stag3
started to distribute around the chromosomes (Figure 1A).
In metaphase I and metaphase II oocytes, Stag3 exhibited
a spindle-like localization pattern (Figure 1A). To confirm
the possible relationship between Stag3 and spindle
apparatus, we double stained Stag3 with microtubule
subunit α-tubulin. As expected, the result showed that
fluorescent signals of Stag3 and α-tubulin were indeed
overlapped in the metaphase I oocytes (Figure 1B),

during oocyte meiosis.

We applied a morpholino-based gene-silencing
approach to deplete Stag3. Fully-grown GV oocytes
were microinjected with control and Stag3-specific
morpholinos and arrested in medium supplemented with
milrinone for 20 h, allowing enough time to inhibit mRNA
translation. As shown in Figure 2A, the protein level of
Stag3 in Stag3-depleted oocytes was remarkably reduced
compared to controls, verifying the effect of knockdown
by morpholino injection. Then MO-injected oocytes were

immunostained with anti-α-tubulin-FITC antibody to
observe the spindle morphologies and counterstained with
Hoechst 33342 to analyze the chromosome alignment. The
results showed that most of control oocytes exhibited a
typical barrel-shape spindle apparatus with a well-aligned
chromosome on the equatorial plate (Figure 2B). By
contrast, a variety of disrupted spindle morphologies and
misaligned chromosomes was observed in Stag3 MOinjected oocytes (Figure 2B). Statistically, about 80% of
oocytes displayed the disorganized spindles (78.3% ±
4.7%, n=142) and more than 70% of oocytes exhibited
misaligned chromosomes (70.7% ± 7.9%, n=142)
compared to approximately 20% of defects in controls
(21.5% ± 0.7%, n=121; 19.2% ± 1.5%, n=121; p < 0.05;
Figure 2C, 2D). Therefore, the results suggest that Stag3 is
required for spindle assembly and chromosome alignment
during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation.

Impaired spindle assembly predicts that microtubule
stability and dynamics might be compromised in the
absence of Stag3. To test this, we examined the acetylated
level of α-tubulin, a marker of stabilized microtubules,
to assess the microtubule stability in oocytes. As shown
in Figure 3A, the Stag3-depleted oocytes exhibited a
prominently reduced fluorescence intensity of acetylated
α-tubulin compared to control oocytes (96.9 ± 2.8,
n=45 VS 57.1 ± 4.4, n=39, p < 0.05; Figure 3B). The
hypoacetylation of α-tubulin suggests that microtubules
are less stable with the loss of stag3, which hence impairs
microtubule dynamics and organization.
To further define the role of Stag3 in regulation
of microtubule stability, the microtubule resistance to

the microtubule depolymerizing drug was tested in the
presence of nocodazole. In control oocytes, five minutes
after nocodazole treatment, although spindle apparatus
was collapsed, microtubules still persisted (Figure
4A). In striking contrast, following the same treatment,
microtubules were completely depolymerized in Stag3depleted oocytes, showing the reduced microtubule
stability in these oocytes (Figure 4B). Collectively, these
results indicate that Stag3 plays a crucial role in spindle
assembly by regulating microtubule stability.

microtubule attachments by employing cold treatment to
depolymerize unstable microtubules upon depletion of
Stag3. For this purpose, metaphase I oocytes were briefly
chilled to induce depolymerization of microtubules that are
not attached to kinetochores, and then immunostained with
CREST to detect kinetochores, with anti-α-tubulin-FITC
antibody to visualize the microtubules and counterstained
with Hoechst 33342 to observe chromosomes. It was
shown that in a large majority of control oocytes
kinetochores were fully attached by microtubules and
chromosomes were well-aligned after cold treatment
(11.2% ± 1.8%, n=98; Figure 5A, 5B). However, a
significantly elevated frequency of kinetochores with
very few cold-stable microtubules was observed in Stag3depleted oocytes (57.2% ± 2.2%, n=100, p < 0.05; Figure
5A, 5B). Taken together, this observation suggests that
kinetochores and microtubules attach less stably after
depletion of Stag3, which might contribute to the failure
of chromosome alignment.

Depletion of Stag3 impairs kinetochoremicrotubule attachments during mouse oocyte
meiosis
Since aberrant spindle formation and incorrect
chromosome alignment is always coupled with the
defective interaction between kinetochores and
microtubules, we tested the stability of kinetochore-

Stag3 is required for maintenance of euploidy in
oocytes

of sister chromatids in mitotic cell division requires the
inactivation of SCC function by either proteolytic cleavage
or stripping cohesin molecules from chromatin [21–23].
The original (“mitotic” or “somatic”) cohesin complex is
postulated to have the shape of a “ring” that is potentially
able to physically embrace two chromatids [24].
In mammals there is a meiosis-specific Smc1
subunit (Smc1β), two additional α-kleisins (Rad21L and
Rec8) and another stromal antigen protein (Stag3)[25,
26]. All cohesin complexes are composed of these four
essential subunits. Only one cohesin component known as
Stag3 is represented in all meiosis-specific cohesins. Stag3
is a HEAT repeat protein and it has been reported that
Stag3 is involved in segregating sex chromosomes that
undergo no recombination [27, 28], which is required for
gametogenesis and fertility. Still, we do not know much
about the functional roles of Stag3 during oocyte meiotic
maturation.
Here, we find that Stag3 accumulates on the spindle
apparatus and colocalizes with microtubule fibers in mouse
oocytes. This unique localization pattern is different from
the typical chromatin distribution of cohesin subunits in
mitosis. Also, in meiosis, it has been shown that Stag3
localizes at the interchromatid domain in metaphase I and
is lost from chromosome arms during the metaphase-toanaphase I transition in mouse spermatocytes [29]. Thus,
the distinct localization of Stag3 during mouse oocyte

To determine whether chromosome misalignment
would result in aneuploidy, an abnormal number of
chromosomes in mouse eggs, which might lead to
miscarriage, embryonic lethality or genetic disorders,
we then analyzed the karyotype of metaphase II oocytes
by chromosome spreading. As shown in Figure 6A, the
number of single chromosomes (univalents) in the normal
eggs was 20, which is expected in the mouse for genomic
integrity. Whereas a significantly higher incidence of
aneuploid eggs that had more or less 20 univalents was
found in Stag3-depleted oocytes compared to controls
(7.8% ± 0.7%, n=39 VS 45.8% ± 2.2%, n=31, p < 0.05;
Figure 6B), suggesting that loss of Stag3 in oocytes are
unable to properly assemble the spindles and align the
chromosomes and thus prone to produce aneuploid eggs.

DISCUSSION
Stag3 encodes a meiosis-specific subunit of the
cohesin complex that ensures correct sister chromatid
cohesion and enables correct synapsis and segregation of
chromosomes during meiosis. Cohesin is the key activity
that establishes SCC (Sister Chromatid Cohesion) and then
holds sister chromatids until the anaphase. The separation

meiotic maturation predicts that it might play an important
role in microtubule dynamics and spindle organization
beyond its function as a subunit of cohesin complex.
Consistent with this idea, loss-of-function experiments
performed by gene-targeting morpholino micro-injection
shows that depletion of Stag3 disrupts the normal spindle
formation and correct chromosome alignment with a much
higher frequency.
The observation of impaired spindle assembly
further prompted us to examine the role of Stag3 in
regulation of microtubule dynamics. Tubulin acetylation
that occurs on Lys-40 of the α-tubulin subunit has been
found in mouse oocytes as an indicator of stabilized
microtubules. Acetylated α-tubulin is abundant in stable
microtubules but is absent in dynamic subcellular
structures [30]. Thus we examined the acetylated level
of α-tubulin in Stag3-depleted oocytes. The remarkable
reduction in immunofluorescent signals of acetylated
α-tubulin indicates that Stag3 is crucial for microtubule
stability during mouse oocyte meiosis. Another line
of evidence to prove this is that depletion of Stag3
compromises the microtubule resistance to microtubule
depolymerizing drug nocodazole. After same time of

treatment with nocodazole, microtubule fibers still persist
in control oocytes rather than Stag3-depleted oocytes.
Taken together, these observations reveal that Stag3
plays an important role in spindle organization through
regulating microtubule stability.
The kinetochore contains approximately 100
different proteins that clustered in several different
complexes on centromeric DNA, including inner
kinetochore proteins, outer kinetochore proteins, as
well as regulatory proteins [31, 32, 33]. Through
these multiprotein structures, kinetochore attaches
chromosomes to spindle microtubules and maintain the
attachment to growing or disassembling microtubule to
drive chromosomes segregation [34–36]. Therefore, if
errors of kinetochore-microtubule attachment could not be
corrected until anaphase, they would cause chromosome
misalignment and missegregation [37, 38]. We therefore
propose that Stag3 participates in maintaining the
attachment between kinetochores and microtubules based
on the observation of the higher frequency of incorrect
chromosome alignment in Stag3-depleted oocytes. As
expected, our findings show that a significantly elevated
proportion of kinetochores are unattached by microtubules

upon cool treatment which is able to depolymerize
unattached microtubules. As a result, our data also reveal
that loss of Stag3 produces a higher incidence of aneuploid
eggs which are highly correlated with miscarriage, birth
defects and genetic disorders. The mutations of TUBB8,
a microtubule related gene, have recently been identified
as the genetic cause of human oocyte maturation
arrest which occurs frequently in the clinical in vitro
fertilization, leading to female infertility [39]. However,
other undiscovered genes can also result in human oocyte
maturation arrest, and our findings suggest that Stag3, as
a microtubule regulator, might be one candidate in this
pool of genes.
In conclusion, our study presents a body of evidence
showing that Stag3 is a master regulator of microtubule
dynamics that maintains normal spindle assembly,
proper chromosome alignment and correct kinetochoremicrotubule attachment to prevent generation of aneuploid
eggs, providing a new molecular determinant controlling
oocyte development and helping dissect the molecular
bases of infertility, miscarriage, early embryonic lethality
and birth defects in humans.

after culture, oocytes were collected for subsequent
analysis.

Morpholino knockdown
Fully grown GV-intact oocytes were microinjected
with 5–10 pl of non-targeting or Stag3-targeting
morpholinos (Gene tools, Philomath, OR, USA) in M2
medium containing 2.5 μM milrinone. The working
concentration of morpholinos was 1 mM. To facilitate
the inhibition of mRNA translation by morpholinos,
microinjected oocytes were arrested at GV stage in M16
medium containing 2.5 μM milrinone for 20 h, and then
transferred to milrinone-free M16 medium to resume
the meiosis for further experiments. Stag3 morpholino
