BACKGROUND: Recent observational studies have shown that metformin use in diabetic patients decreases both
cancer incidence and mortality. Metformin use is also independently predictive of pathologic complete response. In
the current study, the authors explored the association between metformin use and survival outcomes in patients
with triple receptor-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: The
Breast Cancer Management System database of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center identified 1448
women who received adjuvant chemotherapy for TNBC between 1995 and 2007. Patients were categorized by diabetes status and metformin use. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was used to calculate distant metastasis-free
survival (DMFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards models were fit
to determine the association between metformin use and survival outcomes. RESULTS: The study cohort was comprised of 63 diabetic patients receiving treatment with metformin, 67 diabetic patients not receiving metformin, and
1318 nondiabetic patients. Patients in the diabetic groups tended to be older (P ¼ .005); more diabetic patients were
postmenopausal (P ¼ .0007), black (P ¼ .0001), and obese (P < .0001). At a median follow-up of 62 months, there
were no significant differences with regard to 5-year DMFS (P ¼ .23), RFS (P ¼ .38), and OS (P ¼ .58) between the 3
groups. Compared with the metformin group, patients who did not receive metformin (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63; 95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 0.87-3.06 [P ¼ .13]) and nondiabetic patients (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 0.97-2.71 [P ¼ .06])
tended to have a higher risk of distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study suggest that
metformin use during adjuvant chemotherapy does not significantly impact survival outcomes in diabetic patients

INTRODUCTION
It is believed that 8% to 18% of cancer patients have diabetes.1 The increased coexistence of diabetes with breast cancer
has been related to the mitogenic effects of signaling through the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and insulin
receptor.2,3 Diabetes mellitus is believed not only to be a moderate risk factor for breast cancer but also to considerably
worsen prognosis in patients with this disease.4,5
Metformin is a widely prescribed oral hypoglycemic agent that is used as first-line therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Several studies have suggested a possible association between the use of metformin and a decreased risk of
cancer,6-9 and cancer-specific mortality in diabetic patients.6,10 The mechanisms involved in the antiproliferative effects of
metformin are most likely very diverse.11,12 Preclinical studies with breast cancer cell lines have demonstrated that metformin acts as a growth inhibitor that is mediated by upregulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and
downstream suppression of signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).13 Other mechanisms
include, in particular, influences on estrogen biosynthesis and estrogenic signal transduction14-16 and suppression of

human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) protein expression.17 More recently, Liu et al18 demonstrated
unique apoptotic effects of metformin against triple receptor-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines via poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and the activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic caspase signaling cascades. Moreover, in nude mice, metformin modestly
inhibited tumor growth of xenografts of a TNBC cell
line.18
Recent observational studies have shown that metformin use in patients with diabetes decreases both cancer
incidence and mortality.6,10 Strikingly, this effect
appeared to improve with higher doses.6,19 Despite these
promising results, to the best of our knowledge there is
only sparse evidence from clinical studies addressing the
relative impact of metformin on the outcome of patients
with breast cancer. Furthermore, it is not clear whether
metformin use is predictive of improved long-term survival outcomes.
The objective of the current study was to investigate
in a retrospective setting the distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall
survival (OS) outcomes among diabetic patients receiving
treatment with metformin, diabetic patients not receiving
metformin, and nondiabetic patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
The Breast Cancer Management System database of The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
(MDACC) identified 1448 women who were diagnosed
and treated with adjuvant chemotherapy for TNBC
between 1995 and 2007. Patients with metastatic or bilateral disease, a prior history of cancer, resolved gestational
diabetes, or diabetes diagnosed after the period of adjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the analysis.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at MDACC. Accuracy of clinical variables recorded
within the prospectively collected data was verified by retrospective review of individual patient records.
Pathologic Evaluation
All pathologic specimens were reviewed by dedicated
breast pathologists at MDACC. Invasive carcinoma was
confirmed on initial core needle biopsy specimens. The
initial clinical stage and pathologic stage of disease in all
patients were revised and based on the seventh edition of
the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging crite-

ria.20 Histologic type and grade were defined according to
the World Health Organization classification system21
and modified Black nuclear grading system,22 respectively. Negative estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone
receptor (PR) status was defined as nuclear staining of 
10% on immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. HER-2–
negative status was defined as either 1þ or no staining
by IHC and/or the absence of gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Treatment
The type of surgery undertaken and adjuvant chemotherapy received were at the discretion of the patient and multidisciplinary treating team. Surgical intervention was
breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for 51% of patients (n ¼
738) and mastectomy for 49% of patients (n ¼ 710).
Adjuvant chemotherapy regimens were comprised of
anthracycline-based regimens with a taxane (758 patients;
45%) or without a taxane (675 patients; 40%),
single-agent taxane (65 patients; 4%), and non–anthracycline-containing/non–taxane-containing regimens (181
patients; 11%). Postoperative radiotherapy was administered if patients had undergone BCS, had locally advanced
disease at the time of presentation, had a primary tumor
measuring > 5 cm, or had  4 involved axillary lymph
nodes. None of the patients received adjuvant endocrine
therapy.
Statistical Analysis and Outcome Measures
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the 3
study groups were compared with the chi-square test.
DMFS, RFS, and OS were defined as the time from the
date of definitive surgery until the first date of documented distant metastasis, disease recurrence, or death
from any cause, respectively. Patients not experiencing the
relevant endpoints were censored at the time of last follow-up. Survival outcomes were estimated with the
Kaplan-Meier product-limit method; groups were compared using the log-rank statistic. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to determine the association
between the use of metformin and survival outcomes after
adjustment for age (> 50 years vs  50 years), tumor T
classification (T3-4 vs T1-2), lymph node classification
(N1-3 vs N0), nuclear grade (3 vs 1/2, lymphovascular
invasion (LVI) (positive vs negative), and chemotherapy
type (anthracycline-based chemotherapy vs taxane-based
chemotherapy vs anthracyclines and taxane-based chemotherapy vs other). Factors included in the multivariate
models for adjustment were based on both statistical and

clinical significance. Hazard rate and ratio values were
estimated using kernel functions.23 Statistical analyses
were performed using SAS (version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC) and S-Plus (version 7.0; Insightful Corporation, Seattle, WA) statistical software.

RESULTS
Patient Demographics and Clinical
Characteristics
A total of 1448 patients were included in the statistical
analysis, 130 of whom (9%) were diabetic and 1318 of
whom (91%) were nondiabetic. Of all the diabetic
patients, 63 (48%) were receiving metformin during adjuvant chemotherapy (metformin group). In the nonmetformin group, glycemic control was achieved using
different modes of antidiabetic therapy, including dietary
treatment only (30%), sulfonylurea preparations (28%),
insulin therapy (39%), or thiazolidinediones (20%).
Patient demographics and clinical characteristics including comorbidities and concomitant medications are summarized in Table 1. Patients in the diabetic groups were
older (P ¼ .005) than those in the nondiabetic group. The
diabetic groups also had a higher percentage of postmenopausal (P ¼ .0007), black (P ¼ .0001), and obese (P <
.0001) patients compared with the nondiabetic group.
The other potential prognostic factors were not found to
be significantly different among the 3 groups. Aspirin was
more frequently used in the nonmetformin group than in
the metformin group (P ¼ .05); however, there were no
differences noted in the use of thiazolidinediones, statins,
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers between the 2 diabetic groups.
Survival Estimates
The median follow-up for the patients who were still alive
at the time of last follow-up was 62 months (range, 1
month-176 months). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of
DMFS, RFS, and OS stratified by groups (metformin,
nonmetformin, and nondiabetic) are shown in Figures 1A
to 1C.
Of all the patients, 559 (39%) developed distant
metastases: 18 (29%) in the metformin group, 26 (39%)
in the nonmetformin group, and 515 (39%) in the nondiabetic group (Table 2). The 5-year DMFS estimates
were 73%, 66%, and 60%, respectively, in the metformin
group, the nonmetformin group, and the nondiabetic
group (P ¼ .23). When comparing patients who received
metformin with patients who did not, the 5-year

1204

DMFS estimates were 60% versus 73% (P ¼ .09). After
adjustment for age, body weight, tumor size, lymph node
status, nuclear grade, LVI, and type of adjuvant chemotherapy received, compared with the metformin group,
patients who did not receive treatment with metformin
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 0.87-3.06 [P ¼ .13]) and nondiabetic patients (HR,
1.62; 95% CI, 0.97-2.71 [P ¼ .06]) tended to have a
higher risk of developing distant metastases (Table 3).
Overall, there were 647 (44%) recurrences: 24 (38%)
in the metformin group, 29 (43%) in the nonmetformin
group, and 594 (45%) in the nondiabetic group. The estimated 5-year RFS rates were not different among the 3
groups (65% in the metformin group, 64% in the nonmetformin group, and 54% in the nondiabetic group; P ¼ .38).
After adjustment for age, body weight, tumor size, lymph
node status, nuclear grade, LVI, and type of adjuvant chemotherapy received, there were no significant differences noted
with regard to risk of disease recurrence between the nonmetformin (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.78-2.40 [P ¼ .27]) versus
the metformin groups and the nondiabetic (HR, 1.36; 95%
CI, 0.87-2.10 [P ¼ .17]) versus the metformin groups.
On univariate analyses, older age (> 50 years),
smaller tumor size, absence of metastatic lymph nodes or
LVI, undergoing BCS rather than mastectomy, and
receiving adjuvant radiotherapy or anthracycline-based
chemotherapy were found to be associated with higher
DMFS and RFS rates. On multivariate analyses, older
age, T1 to T2 status, N0 status, and negative LVI
remained independent significant predictors of improved
DMFS and RFS.
There were a total of 535 (37%) deaths: 20 (32%)
in the metformin group, 23 (34%) in the nonmetformin
group, and 492 (37%) in the nondiabetic group. The 5year OS estimates were 67% in the metformin group,
69% in the nonmetformin group, and 66% in the nondiabetic group (P ¼ .58). After adjustment for age, body
weight, tumor size, lymph node status, nuclear grade,
LVI, and type of adjuvant chemotherapy received, using
the metformin group as the reference, the nonmetformin
group (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.66-2.28 [P ¼ .52]) and the
nondiabetic group (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.79-2.08 [P ¼
.31]) were each found to have a nonsignificantly increased
risk of death. When comparing patients with diabetes
who were receiving metformin versus those who were not,
the P values (as determined by the log-rank test) were .29
for DMFS, .053 for RFS, and .80 for OS, respectively.
On univariate analyses, younger age ( 50 years),
T3 to T4 status, N1 to N3 status, positive LVI, and higher

DISCUSSION
Herein, we present the results of our single-institution
study in a large cohort of women with TNBC, and assess
the role of metformin during adjuvant chemotherapy in
survival outcomes. The current study data suggest that
concurrent use of metformin with adjuvant chemotherapy
does not significantly impact survival outcomes in diabetic patients with TNBC; however, patients who do not
take metformin and nondiabetic patients tend to have a
higher risk of developing distant metastases.
In the current study cohort, diabetic patients were
more likely to be black and obese. Although nondiabetic
patients tended to be younger, they had a similar clinical
stage of disease at the time of presentation compared with
diabetic patients. Consistent with the findings of previous

1208

studies,24,25 the histopathological tumor features were not
different between the diabetic patients and nondiabetic
patients. The choice of adjuvant chemotherapy did not
differ between the 3 groups. We also evaluated the use of
thiazolidinediones and other concomitant medications in
the diabetic groups, because there is evidence that these
agents (thiazolidinediones,26 aspirin,27,28 statins,29,30 and
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers31) may affect tumorigenesis. Among these
medications, only aspirin use was found to be significantly
different between the 2 diabetic groups.
In contrast to previous studies,25,32-34 our findings
demonstrated that in this group of patients with TNBC,
the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was not associated
with lower survival outcomes, even when diabetic patients
had other poor prognostic features including black race
and obesity.35-39 We could speculate that worse survival
in diabetic patients is most likely ameliorated by strict glycemic control and therefore through the restoration of tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
At the level of cell signaling, metformin is known to
improve insulin resistance-associated hyperinsulinemia,
mainly by affecting the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway,
which has been shown to induce cell cycle proliferation,
tumor formation, and metastases.40-42 Metformin also
exerts direct inhibitory effects on the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway through
activation of AMPK.13,43-45 Consequently, metformin
was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer in
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in various observational studies.6,7 In addition, evidence suggests a lower

cancer-related mortality rate in diabetic patients who are
treated with metformin compared with sulfonylurea preparations and, possibly, insulin therapy.6,8,10,46,47
It is not clear whether metformin use is predictive of
improved long-term survival in patients with breast cancer. Epidemiological studies reported up to a 23%
reduced risk of cancer-related mortality for metformin
users compared with that for nonusers.10,47 Jiralerspong
et al reported a 3-fold greater pathologic complete
response rate in diabetic patients with breast cancer who
received metformin during neoadjuvant chemotherapy
compared with those who did not (odds ratio, 2.95; 95%
CI, 1.07-8.17 [P ¼ .04]).25 With a limited follow-up, the
estimated 3-year RFS and OS rates tended to be better in
the metformin group versus the nonmetformin group.
However, metformin was not found to be an independent
predictor of either RFS or OS after adjusting for diabetes
status, body mass index, age, stage of disease, nuclear
grade, ER/PR status, and taxane use. Although we did not
observe a significant survival benefit with the concurrent
use of metformin and adjuvant chemotherapy in our
cohort of patients with TNBC, in the multivariate survival model, patients receiving metformin tended to have
a reduced risk of developing distant metastasis compared
with patients who were not receiving the drug (P ¼ .06
when compared with nondiabetic patients). In addition,
when the 2 diabetic groups were compared (metformin vs
nonmetformin), there was a beneficial effect of metformin
use noted in diabetic patients with regard to RFS (P ¼
.053).
Metformin has been shown to reduce insulin levels
by 22% in nondiabetic, hyperinsulinemic women with
early stage breast cancer.48 In clinical studies, elevated insulin levels have been associated with an increased rate of
breast cancer recurrence and death.49,50 Furthermore,
there is recent evidence of the efficacy of nonpharmacologic interventions that reduce insulin resistance in affecting breast cancer outcomes. For example, in the Women’s
Intervention Nutrition Study,24,51 lower dietary fat intake
and weight loss in the intervention group correlated with
lower rates of disease recurrence (9.8% vs 12.4%) and
death (7.5% vs 18.1%) compared with the control group.
In the subgroup analyses, dietary fat reduction had a
greater effect on RFS in women with ER-negative breast
tumors.
The known adverse prognostic factors such as
younger age,52,53 larger tumor size,54 positive lymph node
status, and LVI55-57 were confirmed to be prognostic in
the current analysis. We also demonstrated that patients

Cancer

March 1, 2012

treated with either single-agent taxane or non–anthracycline-containing/non–taxane-containing chemotherapy
regimens had an increased risk of distant metastases, disease recurrence, and death. The differential influence of
anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens on the
outcome of patients with TNBC will require confirmation. Recently, Hirsch et al58 demonstrated that combination therapy with metformin and doxorubicin reduces
tumor mass and prevents disease recurrence much more
effectively than either drug alone in a breast cancer xenograft mouse model. Moreover, selective inhibition of
breast cancer stem cells by metformin appeared to have a
dramatic effect on prolonging remission.58 This interesting evidence provides the rationale for studying metformin with an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen
as a new treatment for breast cancer.
Although previous studies have shown the potential
efficacy of metformin as an antitumor agent in patients
with breast cancer, these studies differ from the current
work in that no account of the adjuvant breast cancer
treatment was presented. However, several limitations
must be considered when interpreting the results of the
current study. It should be noted that our conclusions are
mainly based on the subgroup of 63 metformin users and
1385 control patients, and therefore rely on a relatively
small number of case and control patients. In addition,
patient selection for individual treatment regimens may
have influenced the differences in oncologic outcome. We
did not have available data regarding the duration of diabetes, metformin use before the index date in the diabetic
group, or metformin use in the nondiabetic group for
other comorbid conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Another limitation is that the level of surveillance and detection of
nonfatal outcomes in particular might vary according to
diabetes status. We also could not add the comorbidity
score as a potential adjustment variable because we did
not have enough information regarding the severity of
comorbid conditions. Hence, the potential impact of
these confounding factors on outcome need to be
acknowledged.
In conclusion, the results of the current retrospective
analysis suggest that metformin use during adjuvant therapy was not associated with improved survival outcomes
in diabetic patients with TNBC. However, there was a
trend toward a decrease in the risk of developing distant
metastasis in diabetic patients receiving metformin compared with nondiabetic patients. In light of the evidence
that the majority of breast cancer deaths result from

1209

Original Article

distant metastatic recurrence, these findings deserve to be
tested with additional prospective studies. Currently, the
impact of metformin on survival outcomes in patients
treated with adjuvant breast cancer therapy is being investigated in a phase 3 randomized trial conducted by the
National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials
Group.
