Abstract

Author Manuscript

While recent studies indicated roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in physiologic aspects
of cell-type determination and tissue homeostasis1 yet their potential involvement in regulated
gene transcription programs remain rather poorly understood. Androgen receptor (AR) regulates a
large repertoire of genes central to the identity and behavior of prostate cancer cells2, and
functions in a ligand-independent fashion in many prostate cancers when they become hormone
refractory after initial androgen deprivation therapy3. Here, we report that two lncRNAs highly
overexpressed in aggressive prostate cancer, PRNCR1 and PCGEM1, bind successively to the AR
and strongly enhance both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent AR-mediated gene activation

programs and proliferation in prostate cancer cells. Binding of PRNCR1 to the C-terminally
acetylated AR on enhancers and its association with DOT1L appear to be required for recruitment
of the second lncRNA, PCGEM1, to the DOT1L-mediated methylated AR N-terminus.
Unexpectedly, recognition of specific protein marks by PCGEM1-recruited Pygopus2 PHD
domain proves to enhance selective looping of AR-bound enhancers to target gene promoters in
these cells. In “resistant” prostate cancer cells, these overexpressed lncRNAs can interact with,
and are required for, the robust activation of both truncated and full length AR, causing ligandindependent activation of the AR transcriptional program and cell proliferation. Conditionallyexpressed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting of these lncRNAs in castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC) cell lines strongly suppressed tumor xenograft growth in vivo. Together, these
results suggest that these overexpressed lncRNAs can potentially serve as a required component of
castration-resistance in prostatic tumors.

Author Manuscript

One of the overexpressed lncRNAs in prostate cancer, PCGEM1, is tissue-specific and
correlated with high-risk prostate cancer patients, including African-American men4, while a
second highly expressed lncRNA, PRNCR1 (PCNCR1), is pervasively transcribed from the
8q24 “gene desert” region in strong association with susceptibility of prostate cancer5.
Paired benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPT) and aggressive tumor specimens (Gleason scores
3+3) derived from three individual prostate cancer patients exhibited >100-fold upregulation
of PRNCR1 and PCGEM1 expression (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Native RNAImmunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments in paired prostate tumor and BPH tissues (Gleason
scores 2+3 to 4+3), revealed a specific association of full-length AR with both PRNCR1 and
PCGEM1 in prostate tumor tissues (Fig. 1a, b; Supplementary Fig. 1a, c) compared to
minimal interactions with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Supplementary Fig. 1c and data not
shown). In LNCaP cells, DHT treatment induced association of AR with both PRNCR1 and
PCGEM1 (Fig. 1c), but not with NEAT2 (Fig. 1c). Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO)-based
knock-down of PRNCR1 abolished both AR-PRNCR1 and AR-PCGEM1 interactions while
knock-down of PCGEM1 did not affect the AR-PRNCR1 interaction (Fig. 1d;
Supplementary Fig. 2a), suggesting the PRNCR1-dependent recruitment of PCGEM1.

Author Manuscript

Knock-down of either PRNCR1 or PCGEM1 resulted in a significantly decrease in DHTinduced activation of canonical AR target genes while not affecting AR levels
(Supplementary Fig. 2a-c). Global run-on sequencing (GRO-Seq) confirmed that knockdown of either PRNCR1 or PCGEM1 significantly decreased the induction of 617 DHTupregulated genes (n=617, edgeR FDR < 0.01, and read density RD > 2) with AR-bound
enhancers within 200kb (Fig. 1e), but had no effect on DHT-unresponsive genes located
>200kb away from AR-bound enhancers (Supplementary Fig. 2d), verified by randomly
extracting sets of 1,000 genes (data not shown).
Using Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP)6 with biotin-labeled DNA probes

2,142 high-confidence PCGEM1 occupancy sites genome-wide (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e)
and motif analysis revealed a very significantly enriched AR response element (ARE) DNA
motif (Supplementary Fig. 3f), revealing that ~82% of PGCEM1 co-localized with ARbound sites (−3kb/+3kb relative to the center of PCGEM1 peak), of which ~70%
corresponded to AR bound, H3K4me1-marked enhancers (Fig. 1f, g and Supplementary Fig.
3g), independently confirmed by qPCR analyses (Supplementary Fig. 3h, i) and ChIRP-Seq
using even-numbered and odd-numbered probe sets (Supplementary Fig. 3j and data not
shown). These data suggest a stoichiometry of PCGEM1 sufficient to account for the
recruitment to AR DNA regulatory binding sites on enhancers. Levels of PRNCR1 in
LNCaP cells are estimated as ~400-600 copies/cell (data not shown). The ability of these
lncRNAs to read enhancer-associated histone marks might account for their preferential
presence at AR-bound enhancers (vide infra).

By imposing a high stringency wash condition, we identified that DOT1L, CARM1,
GADD45α, and AR specifically associated with in vitro-transcribed biotinylated PRNCR1
by Mass-spectrometry analysis, while AR, β-Catenin, and Pygopus2 (Pygo2) preferentially
associated with in vitro-transcribed biotinylated PCGEM1 (Supplementary Fig. 4a-c;
Supplementary Tables 1-3). β-Catenin, CARM1 and GADD45α have been suggested to play
important roles in AR signaling7. Knock-down of AR, Dot1L, β-catenin, and Pygo2 by
specific siRNAs impaired DHT-induced activation of AR-target genes, TMPRSS2, PSA, and
FKBP5 (Supplementary Fig. 4d). Mass-spectrometry analysis revealed that the lncRNAbound AR contains several post-translational modifications, including K631/634 acetylation
and K349 methylation (Supplementary Fig. 4e; Supplementary Tables 1-3). Consistent with
the proposed importance of acetylation of AR in activation of an AR target gene8, a
K631/634R mutation on AR inhibited its interaction with PRNCR1 and PCGEM1 (Fig. 2a;
Supplementary Fig. 5a) and DHT-induced expression of AR target genes (Supplementary
Fig. 5b), while overexpression of a AR K631/634Q mutant resulted in enhanced DHTdependent interactions with PRNCR1 and PCGEM (Fig. 2a, b; Supplementary Fig. 5c).
These data suggest that PRNCR1 and PCGEM1 interact with AR in a K631/634 acetylationand K349 methylation-dependent manner, respectively.

Author Manuscript

Because effective AR-PCGEM1 interaction requires the methylation of AR at K349 (Fig.
2b), we confirmed DOT1L-mediated AR methylation at K349 using in vitro methylation
assays, finding that a K349R point mutation significantly inhibited AR methylation
(Supplementary 6a; Fig. 2c). Specific DOT1L knock-down impaired the interaction between
AR and PCGEM1, but not that with PRNCR1 (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c), suggesting that
AR K349 methylation, mediated by PRNCR1-bound DOT1L, is critical for the recruitment
of PCGEM1 to AR. Indeed, overexpression of an AR K349R mutant significantly reduced
DHT-induced gene activation in LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. 5b).
In vitro binding studies demonstrated that PRNCR1 bound to the region aa 549-623 of AR
and PCGEM1 bound to AR N terminal region when methylated at K349 by overexpressing
DOT1L (Fig. 2d, e; Supplementary Fig. 7a). By incubating in vitro transcribed PCGEM1
with nuclear lysate from cells overexpressing Myc-tagged Pygo2 proteins, including fulllength, N- or C-terminally truncated proteins, we identified strong interactions between
PCGEM1 and the Pygo2 C-terminus (Supplementary Fig. 7b).

To map the sequence motif of PCGEM1 responsible for AR or Pygo2 binding, we
performed modified in vitro RNA pulldown followed by dot-blot assay (Supplementary Fig.
8a), using two regions of NEAT2-bound by unmethylated Pc2 as a control for the CLIP
assay9 (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Methylated AR bound/protected PCGEM1 sequence was
identified to encompass 421GAT…TCC480 (Supplementary Fig. 8c) with unmethylated AR
or the unrelated protein, His-tagged MURF1, not showing specific binding to any region of
PCGEM1 (Supplementary Fig. 8c). A sequence motif of PCGEM1
encompassing 1201TGT…ATT1260, distinct from the AR binding region, was identified as
the Pygo2 binding motif, with deletion of this motif (Δ1191-1270) abolishing Pygo2 binding
with no effect on AR binding (Supplementary Fig. 8c; Fig. 2f). Similarly, deletion of AR
binding site of PCGEM1 (Δ411-490) abolished AR-PCGEM1 interaction, with minimal
effect on Pygo2-PCGEM1 interaction (Fig. 2f).

MODified Histone Peptide Array experiments using in vitro transcribed biotinylated
PCGEM1 or PRNCR1 revealed that they selectively recognize H3K4me1 and H4K16ac
histone marks indicative of enhancers10,11, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 9a-c).
Therefore, it is likely that these histone tail associations of PRNCR1 and PCGEM1 serve as
a functional component of their preferred recruitment to enhancers of AR-regulated
transcription units.

PCGEM1 and PRNCR1 were highly upregulated in the LNCaP-cds2, and CWR22Rv1
castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line models compared with immortalized “normal”
prostate epithelial cell lines, WPE and RWPE, or even LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig.
10a, b). The AR antagonist, bicalutamide (Casodex), reduced the DHT-induced PSA
expression in LNCaP cells but failed to act as an antagonist in LNCaP-cds2 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 10c). Transduction of LNCaP-cds2 cells with lentivirus expressing
shRNAs against PRNCR1 or PCGEM1, but not a non-specific (LacZ) shRNA, significantly
reduced the activation of several canonical AR target genes while having no effect on AR
expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 10d-f and 11a). Because truncated forms of AR that
exhibit ligand-independent transcriptional activation are frequently detected in castrationresistant prostate cancer and may often reflect alterations in AR gene structure, we
investigated the potential roles of PRNCR1 and PCGEM1 in AR-mediated basal
transcription activity in CRPC cells. RT-PCR using primers specific for one AR “splicing”
variant, AR-V712 confirmed the presence of this variant in LNCaP-cds2 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 11b). Western blot analysis using N-terminal AR-specific antibody
(441), revealed that the AR-V7 variant (~75kDa) represents ~1-2% of total AR in LNCaPcds2 cells, although it is the predominant form in CWR22Rv1 cells (Supplementary Fig.
10g). Because overexpression of truncated AR can constitutively activate androgenresponsive genes in the absence of ligand12, we transfected LNCaP cells with AR Q641X
mutant, with activation of canonical androgen-responsive genes, including TMPRSS2, PSA,
KLK2, FKBP5, and NKX3-1 in the absence of added androgen (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig.
12a, b). This constitutive effect of AR Q641X was highly reduced upon knock-down of
either PRNCR1 or PCGEM1 (Fig. 3a). RIP assay in CWR22Rv1 cells demonstrated that
both PRNCR1 and PCGEM1 associated constitutively with truncated AR (AR-V7) with or
without ligand (Fig. 3b). By immunoblotting the AR-V7 immunoprecipitates with N-

terminal AR-specific antibody (441), we did not observe any residual pull-down indicative
of interaction between full length and truncated AR (Fig. 3b, right panel), arguing against an
indirect association of PRNCR1 and PCGEM1 with truncated AR consequent to
hetrodimerization with full length AR. Using an antibody specific for the C-terminal ligand
binding domain of AR (C-19) to selectively recognize full length AR, we observed
interactions between these lncRNAs and full length AR in the absence of added ligand (Fig.
3b), possibly due to the relative higher level of basal acetylation and methylation of fulllength AR in CWR22Rv1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 12c).

To study the biological roles of PRNCR1 or PCGEM1, we generated stable cell lines derived
from CWR22Rv1 harboring Doxycycline (Dox)-induced shRNA against LacZ, PRNCR1 or
PCGEM1 (Supplementary Fig. 13a). Dox-induced either PCGEM1 or PRNCR1 knock-down
significantly reduced the expression of canonical AR target genes, with no noticeable effect
on AR expression level (Supplementary Fig. 11a, 13b). Dox-induced knock-down of either
PRNCR1 or PCGEM1 also inhibited the growth of CWR22Rv1 cells comparable to the
effect of AR knock-down13, without affecting AR expression levels (Fig. 3c; Supplementary
Fig. 11a and 13c). Remarkably, conditional shRNA-mediated inhibition of either PRNCR1
or PCGEM1 robustly inhibited in vivo tumor growth in a CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer
xenograft mice model (Fig. 3d), indicative of an lncRNA-dependent regulatory network that
critically regulates growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells in vivo.

Author Manuscript

While knock-down of either PRNCR1 or PCGEM1 did not affect the recruitment of AR on
PSA and KLK2 enhancers (Supplementary Fig. 14a, b, left panels), knock-down of
PCGEM1 inhibited SMC1 recruitment on PSA and KLK2 promoters, with only minimal
effects on SMC1 levels on enhancers (Supplementary Fig. 14a, b, right panels), consistent
with proposed Cohesin-dependent14 formation of chromatin loops between enhancers and
promoters. We further demonstrated ligand-induced enhancer: promoter interactions in the
PSA transcription unit by ChIP-3C assay15 and found that these interactions were impaired
by depletion of either PRNCR1 or PCGEM1 (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Fig. 14c).

Author Manuscript

The ability of Pygo2, associated with PCGEM1 (Supplementary Fig. 2a), to recognize a
canonical promoter histone mark16, H3K4me3, raised the possibility that Pygo2 might be
involved, at least quantitatively, in enhancer: promoter looping. ChIP assays revealed that
Pygo2 was efficiently recruited to enhancer and promoter regions of the PSA, KLK2 and
TMPRSS2 transcription units in a DHT-dependent manner, exhibiting relatively higher and
earlier association with the enhancer regions (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Fig. 15a). Knockdown of either PRNCR1 or PCGEM1 in LNCaP cells inhibited Pygo2 recruitment to ARdependent enhancers/promoters (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Fig. 15b). On knock-down of
Pygo2 , AR and SMC1 failed to effectively associate with the PSA, KLK2 or TMPRSS2
promoters despite unperturbed DHT-dependent AR or SMC1 recruitment to their enhancers
(Supplementary 16a-d) and DHT-induced enhancer: promoter looping in the PSA
transcription unit was inhibited (Fig. 4d). GRO-Seq analysis revealed a broad inhibition of
AR-dependent transcriptional program under the condition of Pygo2 knock-down (n=290,
edgeR FDR < 0.01), which did not affect AR expression (Fig. 4e; Supplementary Fig. 16a).

Depleting PRNCR1 or PCGEM1 from LNCaP-cds2 cells also inhibited enhancer: promoter
looping in FASN and NDRG1 (Supplementary Fig. 17a-d; Fig. 4f), previously shown to be
activated following FoxA1 knock-down in LNCaP cells17. Again, knock-down of either
PRNCR1 or PCGEM1 had no effect on recruitment of AR to enhancer regions of the FASN
and NDRG1 transcription units or on Pygo2 expression levels (Supplementary Figs. 16a,
17e).

Author Manuscript

To address whether the Pygo2 PHD domain might itself be instrumental for its function in
mediating chromatin looping, we first depleted Pygo2 by shRNA followed by
overexpression in LNCaP-cds2 cells of either shRNA-resistant wild-type Pygo218 or a
W352A mutant defective for H3K4me3 recognition16. In 3C assays, knock-down of Pygo2
reduced FASN enhancer: promoter interactions, which could be rescued by overexpression
of wild-type, but not W352A, Pygo2 (Supplementary Fig. 18a, 19a), even though there was
equal recruitment of wild-type Pygo2 or the W352A mutant to enhancers, and no altered
promoter H3K4me3 levels (Supplementary Fig. 18b-d). Knock-down of Pygo2 curtailed the
expression of canonical of AR target genes TMPRSS2, KLK2, PSA, FKBP5, and NKX3-1,
and overexpression of wild-type, but not W352A, Pygo2 was able to robustly rescue the
induction of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 19b). These data suggest that Pygo2 exerts a
quantitatively-important role in DHT-dependent enhancer: promoter interactions and coding
target gene activation. For 220 AR-regulated coding gene promoters under regulation of an
enhancer exhibiting ligand-dependent recruitment of Pygo2 also exhibiting recruitment to
the coding gene promoter by ChIP-seq, we did not observe ligand-induced increase in the
next adjacent, non-AR-regulated transcription unit (~204 promoters) (Supplementary Fig.
19c), indicating that the H3K4me3 mark cannot alone be sufficient to effectively recruit
Pygo2, suggesting a role of other similarly-modified proteins in prostate cancer cell gene
activation events.

Author Manuscript

In the present study, we have found a mechanistic link between prostate cancer-upregulated
lncRNAs and AR transcriptional activity, revealing the biological importance of the
lncRNAs, PRNCR1 and PCGEM1, in licensing C-terminally truncated, as well as full
length, AR-dependent gene activation events in prostate cancer cells (Supplementary Fig.
19d). Considering the regulatory potential of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) identified in recent
studies19,20, lncRNAs may also be part of a broad transcription regulatory network.

RIP was performed in native conditions as described21. Briefly, 1×107 LNCaP cell nuclei
were pelleted and lysed in 1mL ice-cold Polysomal Lysis Buffer (100mM KCl, 5mM
MgCl2, 10mM HEPES [pH 7.0], 0.5% NP-40, 1mM DTT) supplemented with Anti-RNase,
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail, Panobinostat, and Methylstat.
The lysate were passed through a 27.5 gauge needle 4 times to promote nuclear lysis.
Turbo™ DNase (400 U) was then added to the lysate and incubated on ice for 30 min. The
cell lysate was diluted in the NT2 buffer (50mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150mM NaCl, 1mM
MgCl2, 0.05% NP-40) and 50 ul of the supernatant was saved as input for PCR analysis. 500
ul of the supernatant was incubated with 4 μg of AR (441) antibodies-IgG magnetic beads
(pre-blocked by 1×PBS+5 mg/ml BSA) at 4 °C overnight. The RNA/antibody complex was
washed four times (1 ml wash, 5 minutes each) by NT2 buffer supplemented with AntiRNase, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail, Panobinostat and
Methylstat. The RNA was extracted using Acid-Phenol: Chloroform, pH 4.5 (with IAA,
125:24:1) (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and subjected to RT-qPCR
analysis.

designed as the negative control. All probes were biotinylated using Label I® Nucleic Acid
Biotin Labeling Kit from Mirus Biotechnology. LNCaP cells were fixed with 1%
formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Crosslinking was then quenched with
125mM glycine for 5 min. The chromatin preparation, hybridization/elution, deep
sequencing steps were essentially performed as described4 except that wash was conducted
at 50 °C and 65°C. The image analysis and base calling were performed using Illumina’s
computational analysis pipeline. The sequencing reads were aligned to hg18 human genome
by using Bowtie222 and only 1 read/position was kept for downstream analyses. Peak
finding was performed by using HOMER suite23 and the peaks within 1kb from each other
were merged. Peak intersection was computed by using intersectBed in BedTools24, after
extending the peaks with 1kb. In order to call reliable peaks, we have excluded from
analysis the peaks that overlapped the satellite repeats or LacZ ChIRP peaks. The annotation
of the peaks on the human genome and the tag density profiles were computed in HOMER,
and the display of the heatmap were carried in MeV25. Sequenced motif enrichment analysis
was carried in HOMER. For ChIP-Seq data (AR and H3K4me1), peak finding was
performed by using HOMER or SICER26.
Data Processing Procedure for Overlapping ChIP-Seq and ChIRP-Seq

Author Manuscript

We used the standard ChIP-Seq peak finding tools in the processing of ChIRP-Seq data. We
chose HOMER software suite (http://biowhat.ucsd.edu) for the analysis of both AR ChIPSeq and PCGEM1 ChIRP-Seq data, using the same program routine (i.e. findPeaks
command) and the same default parameters that calls only the robust peaks (these
parameters are outlined below): 1) fold enrichment over input tag count, default: 4.0; 2)
poisson p-value threshold relative to input tag count, default: 0.0001; 3) fold enrichment
over local tag count, default: 4.0; 4) poisson p-value threshold relative to local tag count,
default: 0.0001; 5) fdr <#> false discovery rate, default = 0.001; 6) size of region used for
local filtering = 10000; 7) fold over local region required = 4.00. Peak finding procedure: 1)
typically, the tag distribution along the genome could be modeled by a Poisson distribution
and the peak finding algorithm slides windows of fixed size across the genome to find
candidate peaks with a significant tag enrichment (Poisson distribution p-value default 10-4
to 10-5); 2) we use very strict parameters in HOMER to call a peak: a very low FDR (i.e.
0.001), and a high fold enrichment over input tag count (i.e. 4). By default, HOMER also
requires the tag density at peaks to be 4-fold greater than in the surrounding 10 kb region.
Therefore, we ensure that only the sharp peaks with low local background are called and
considered for downstream analyses. Both ChIP-seq and ChIRP-seq data were processed
precisely in the same way using the same default settings of HOMER.

Author Manuscript

For the analysis of overlapping between ChIP-Seq and ChIRP-Seq data, we used the
following samples: PCGEM1ChIRP-Seq (−DHT), PCGEM1 ChIRP-Seq (+DHT), and AR
ChIP-Seq (at a higher sequencing depth). The heatmaps were generated in 2 steps: 1) we
used HOMER and the command [(annotatePeaks.pl <peak file> <genome> −size <#> −hist
<#> −ghist) that specifies the list of peaks (<peak file>), and the tag density in a region that
covers <size> kb around the peak center; the tag density is specified in a bin size that is
specified by the parameter <hist>)] to generate a matrix of tag densities across the samples,
for each peak. Typically the tag densities are normalized to 10 mil reads for each sample; 2)

we used MeV package (http://www.tm4.org/mev/) to display the heatmap and to color code
it on a scale from 0 to 2: a difference in the colors from 2 (red) to 0 (green) may reflect a
fold enrichment over local tag count higher than 4 (4 is typically the default value, used for
peak finding, as we described above).
GRO-Seq

Author Manuscript

The image analysis and base calling were performed by using Illumina’s standard
computational analysis pipeline. Bowtie222 was used to align the sequencing reads to hg18
human genome; when multiple reads aligned to the same genomic position, only 1 read/
position was kept for downstream analyses. We have used RefSeq annotations in order to
estimate the gene expression level by counting the sequencing reads over the gene body
(from 400bp downstream of TSS to TTS) on the sense strand with respect to the gene
transcription, by using intersectBed in BedTools24. In order to call statistically significant
differentially expressed genes, we have used edgeR27 and a FDR < 0.01. Additional criteria,
including read density (normalized number of reads/kb) were imposed in order to filter the
differentially expressed genes. Wilcoxon tests for sample comparisons were computed in R.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, ChIP-Seq and ChIP-3C assay

Author Manuscript

ChIP assays and ChIP-Seq was performed as described28. ChIP-3C assays were performed
as described15 with minor modifications. Briefly, LNCaP cells were cross-linked with 1%

partially purified by His tag or GST tag magnetic beads and the purified RNA-protein
complexes were treated with proteinase K, which removes protein but leaves intact RNAs.
The recovered RNAs were hybridized to BrightStar®-Plus Positively Charged Nylon
Membrane spotted with 60-mer antisense DNA oligonucleotides tiling along the indicated
lncRNA sequence at 37 °C overnight. The anti-sense oligonucleotides corresponding to the
indicated lncRNAs were spotted on membrane as following order (left to right in each row):
A1 is corresponding to the oligonucleotide sequence nt 1-60 of indicated lncRNA, A2 is
corresponding to oligonucleotide sequence nt 61-120 of indicated lncRNA and so on till the
end of the lncRNA sequences. The hybridized membrane was washed as described at
sequential 37°C, 50 °C and 65°C. The protein-bound RNA sequence was visualized by

facility were randomly put into cages with four mice each. They were implanted with
respective tumor cells in the unit of cages. Three million of cells were suspended with
matrigel in the ratio of 2:1 for subcutaneous injection. The experiment was set up to use
eight animals per group to detect a 2-fold increase in tumor size with power of 80% and at
the significance level of 0.05 by a two-sided test for significant studies. In these
experiments, the tumor take rate was often about 50%, so we often ended up with about 4
animals per group, with or without doxycycline treatment. Tumor progression was
monitored by caliper measurement twice a week and the tumor volume was calculated
according to the equation, v=length × width2 ×1/2. When the tumor size reached between
150 – 200 mm3, animals were randomly distributed to groups receiving 1 mg/ml of
doxycycline water or regular water with continuous tumor monitor until tumor burden
exceeded the limit of IACUC humane endpoints (less than 20 mm in one dimension), for 3
to 4 weeks. The investigators were blinded to the group allocation during the experiment
and/or when assessing the outcome. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National
Institutes of Health. Animals were housed in the UC Davis Medical Center Animal Facility
(Sacramento, CA) under pathogen-free conditions; protocol approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.
