BACKGROUND: Adjuvant therapies for pancreatic and periampullary cancer reportedly achieve only a marginal survival benefit. In this randomized controlled trial, 120 patients with resected pancreatic or periampullary cancer
received either adjuvant celiac axis infusion chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy (CAI/RT) or no adjuvant
treatment. The objective of the study was to compare the quality of life (QoL) in patients who received CAI/RT after pancreatoduodenectomy with the QoL in patients who did not receive adjuvant treatment. METHODS: During
and after CAI/RT, QoL was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL
Questionnaire C30 every 3 months during the first 24 months after randomization. RESULTS: Eighty-six percent of
patients (n ¼ 103) completed 1 or more questionnaires. In total, 355 questionnaires were completed. The results indicated that CAI/RT did not impair physical, emotional, or social functioning. During and after CAI/RT, patients had significantly less pain (P ¼.02) and less nausea and vomiting (P ¼.01). Overall QoL (global functioning) tended to be
better (P ¼.08) after CAI/RT. CONCLUSIONS: Over a period of 24 months, CAI/RT improved QoL compared
with observation alone in patients with resected pancreatic and periampullary cancer. This beneficial effect of CAI/RT

Pancreatic cancer is currently 1 of the world’s most fatal malignant diseases and ranks fourth in cancer-related mortality.1 Even after radical resection, the median survival is 12 to 15 months,2,3 and the 5-year survival rate ranges from 5%
to 25%.2,4-6
Considering the short life expectancy after radical resection and the morbidity related to a pancreatoduodenectomy,7
the value of resection has been debated. However, several trials demonstrated that, after pancreatoduodenectomy, quality
of life (QoL) returned to preoperative values 3 months after surgery8 or was even better than before surgery measured up
to 6 months after surgery in patients with localized pancreatic cancer.9,10 However, compared with laparoscopic surgery
for a benign cause (ie, laparoscopic cholecystectomy), patients after pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma have a significantly worse QoL.11 This deleterious effect on QoL may be explained by both the
extent of surgery and the primary indication for surgery, ie, a benign lesion versus a malignant lesion.
To improve survival after pancreatoduodenectomy in patients with pancreatic or periampullary tumors, several clinical trials have studied the efficacy of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Most studies investigated improvements in disease-free or overall survival by adjuvant therapy.2,6,12-17 Only 2 randomized controlled trials also measured the effect of

adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy on QoL.
In the first European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer
trial (ESPAC-1), similar QoL was observed after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)–based chemotherapy (425 mg/m2 with
folinic acid 20 mg/m2 on 5 consecutive days for 6 cycles)
versus no chemotherapy and 5-FU–based chemoradiotherapy (500 mg/m2 on the first 3 days of each week of
radiotherapy; 10  2 grays [Gy]) versus no chemoradiotherapy. The Charite Oncology Studies in Gastrointestinal
Cancer
(CONKO)-001)
trial
compared
chemotherapy (6 cycles of 3 weekly infusions of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2) with observation and reported no
adverse effect on QoL.6,18
In a randomized controlled trial, we compared
intra-arterial chemotherapy (celiac axis infusion) plus
radiotherapy (CAI/RT) with observation after pancreatoduodenectomy in patients with periampullary or pancreatic cancer.19 This therapy involves 6 separate weeks of
hospitalization, indwelling catheters, several angiographies, 6 weeks of daily radiotherapy on an outpatient
basis, and considerable toxicity, mainly of hematologic origin; the therapeutic results were reported previously.
To investigate whether the efficacy of this treatment
was counterbalanced with detrimental effects on QoL,
analysis of the QoL was a predefined secondary endpoint.
The results of the QoL analysis are described in this report.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Because the trial design has been described extensively
before, we summarize only the main aspects.19
Study Design
After pancreatoduodenectomy, patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas or the periampullary region were assigned randomly to receive either
adjuvant CAI/RT or observation. Intra-arterial chemotherapy consisted of 6 cycles of mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2
on Day 1), 5-FU and folinic acid (600 mg/m2 and 170
mg/m2, respectively, on Days 2-4), and cisplatin (60 mg/
m2 on Day 5); patients also received 54 Gy (total dose) of
radiotherapy. During each cycle of chemotherapy,
patients were admitted to hospital, had an indwelling
intra-arterial catheter, and were obliged to stay in bed for
the entire week. During radiotherapy, patients were
treated on an outpatient basis and received 1.8 Gy each
weekday for 6 weeks. Including intervals, the entire schedule lasted for >8 months. None of the patients received

further chemotherapy or radiotherapy in case of recurrence. Patients signed an informed consent.
Quality-of-Life Assessments
Quality of life was measured using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of
Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) version
3.0,20 which is a 30-item, self-reporting questionnaire
that was developed to assess the QoL of cancer patients. It
is grouped into 5 functional subscales (role, physical, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning). It also contains
3 multi-item symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea
and vomiting), individual questions concerning common
symptoms in cancer patients (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite
loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), and
2 questions that assess overall QoL (global functioning).
Quality of life was assessed every 3 months in the
first 24 months after randomization. The first QoL questionnaire was filled out at 3 months and was used as the
baseline. The QoL forms were sent to the patients before a
visit to an outpatient clinic, where filled out forms were
collected.
Outcome Measures and Statistical Analysis
Survival curves were computed according to the KaplanMeier method from the date of randomization to the date
of death from any cause or were censored at the last
follow-up. Median survival was calculated on the basis of
the curve. Survival curves were compared using the logrank test.
All scores from the EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3)
questionnaire were transformed to a scale from 0 to 100
using a linear transformation.20 Higher scores for a functional scale represent a higher level of functioning, ie, a
better state of the patient. Conversely, higher scores for
symptoms indicate a higher level of complaints.
Nine scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 were selected
a priori for this analysis: physical, emotional, and social
functioning; fatigue; pain; nausea and vomiting; loss of
appetite; diarrhea; and global functioning. Compliance
was calculated as the number of completed questionnaires
expressed as a percentage of the number of questionnaires
expected (per time interval). Fifty percent of the standard
deviation of any QoL tool equivalent to 8 to 10 points
usually is considered clinically significant21
All QoL scales were compared between randomized
arms with repeated measurement analyses of variance
using SAS PROC MIXED (version 8.2; SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, NC). For all scales, we was evaluated whether

the treatment effect differed between time points of assessment with interaction terms. Other analyses were done
using SPSS version 11.5 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill). All
evaluations were done on an intent-to-treat basis, and
P ¼ .05 (2-sided) was considered the limit of significance.

RESULTS
Summary of Clinical Results
Between June 2000 and March 2007, 120 patients with
resected pancreatic or periampullary adenocarcinoma
were randomized to receive either intra-arterial chemoradiotherapy (n ¼ 59) or observation (n ¼ 61). Table 1 lists
the characteristics of these patients. The median followup was 17 months.19
Thirty-six percent (21 of 59) of all patients in the
CAI/RT group received all 6 cycles, including radiotherapy, as specified in the protocol. Causes for discontinuation of treatment as planned were adverse toxic events in
13 of 52 patients (25%), progressive disease in 11 patients
(21%), patient refusal in 3 patients (6%), and comorbidity in 3 other patients. Six hundred twenty celiac axis catheterizations were performed, and catheter luxations were
observed in 14% of the placements.
After CAI/RT, patients had a significantly prolonged time to progression (12 months vs 7 months; logrank P<.02). Overall, no significant survival benefit
was observed after CAI/RT compared with observation
(median, 19 months vs 18 months; P ¼ .25), although
cancer-specific survival tended toward significance (29
months vs 18 months; log-rank P ¼ .052).

Quality of Life
Table 2 shows the proportion of patients with assessable
QoL forms in each time interval. Eighty-six percent
(n ¼ 103) of patients completed 1 or more questionnaires,
including 51 patients in the treatment arm and 52
patients in the observation arm, and 71% of patients completed at least 2 questionnaires. In total, 355 questionnaires were completed, with a median of 4 questionnaires
completed (range, 1-7 questionnaires) by patients who
underwent CAI/RT and a median of 3 questionnaires
completed (range, 1-7 questionnaires) by patients in the
observation arm. Overall, 60% of the expected questionnaires were completed and assessable for analysis. The rate
of assessable questionnaires decreased over time, with
more forms available in the CAI/RT arm in the first 6
months but no difference after the end of treatment. The
decrease in the number of questionnaires was not related

In this randomized controlled trial,19 we compared CAI/

schedule lasted a minimum of 8 months with intermittent
hospital admissions. Although there was no overall survival benefit after intra-arterial chemoradiotherapy, cancer-related survival tended to be better in the treatment
arm. Intra-arterial chemoradiotherapy also significantly
extended the time to disease progression in all patients
and reduced the number of liver metastases in patients
who had periampullary tumors.
In this study, QoL measured according to the
EORTC QLQ-C30 principles was improved from baseline after CAI/RT for all endpoints analyzed. On all functioning scales, higher mean scores were reported,
indicating better functioning; although none of these
scores were significant. For all symptom scores, patients
reported fewer complaints, leading to lower mean scores.
For pain and for nausea and vomiting, these scores were
significantly lower after CAI/RT than the scores in the

observation arm for the first 24 months after randomization. For pain scores, for which there was a mean difference of 9.7 points between CAI/RT and surgery alone,
this difference also was clinically relevant. For all QoL
scores, the difference between the CAI/RT arm and the
observation arm was constant over the 24 months, but the
effect of CAI/RT on QoL was most apparent from 12
months to 24 months after the start of therapy. In the first
12 months of QoL assessment, ie, during CAI/RT, symptoms like fatigue, nausea and vomiting, or pain did not
occur more often. Overall QoL tended to be better after
CAI/RT (P ¼ .08).
A limitation of our study is the absence of questionnaires at baseline. Therefore, we could not evaluate
changes from baseline, which are expected to produce
more precise results. Our results are valid, however,
because, from the randomization, it was reasonable to
expect that the baseline QoL would be comparable

between the groups. Also, the number of questionnaires
returned per patient was comparable.
One important feature of QoL assessment is that it
is subjective. This is particularly relevant: CAI/RT may be
expected to have a negative influence on a patient’s QoL
because of the impact of the number and length of hospital admissions, the number of outpatient visits, and the
toxicity of the therapy itself.
However, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are not
necessarily associated with an impaired QoL. More effective
therapies produce a better QoL, because minor tumor
shrinkage relieves some of the symptoms or because they
produce a longer period without disease and, thus, less time
involving the problems of recurrent disease and its treatment. Thus, a longer or more toxic treatment is not always
associated with lower QoL. QoL even can improve when
therapy has no objective effect; this may be because of the
placebo effect, the provision of hope, or the increased medical attention associated with being in a study. In addition,
side effects are not major determinants of QoL.22
A comparison of our results with results from previous randomized controlled trials of adjuvant therapies in
pancreatic and periampullary cancer2,6 indicates that this
is the first trial to demonstrate that adjuvant therapy benefited QoL up to 24 months after resection. One of the reasons for this difference is that the CONKO-001 trial used
the Spitzer Quality of Life Index, a questionnaire focused
on more nonspecific QoL parameters, such as daily activity, social support, and mental well being. Our use of the
EORTC QLQ-C30, which focuses both on functioning
scales and on cancer-specific complaints like pain, fatigue,
and nausea and vomiting, is important, because it is especially on these symptom scores that we observed a benefi-

cial difference for the CAI/RT arm. Although the
ESPAC-1 trial also evaluated QoL with the EORTC
QLQ-C30 questionnaire, it produced a QoL response
percentage of 53%, and it measured QoL only for the first
12 months after resection. In our trial, the most noticeable
differences in all QoL dimensions occurred after the first
12 months. If the ESPAC-1 trial had continued to assess
QoL over a longer period, then it may have revealed a similar difference, although this effect also might have been
reduced by the 2  2 factorial design.
Because survival after adjuvant therapy for resected
pancreatic or periampullary cancer has not lengthened substantially over the years, the objective of adjuvant therapy in
these patients at least should be to improve the QoL during
the short remaining lifetime. We have demonstrated that
CAI/RT, although a demanding therapy, improves QoL
from baseline. Therefore, we believe that it is incorrect to
deny cancer patients intensive therapies only because they
do not result in a significant survival benefit. One of the
possible objective factors underlying this beneficial effect on
QoL is the finding that the time to disease progression is
extended. When patients with recurrent disease develop duodenal obstruction, and especially pain, the postponement
of recurrence leads to a longer complaint-free period and,
thus, better QoL. Because none of our patients were treated
with chemotherapy or radiotherapy after recurrence, there
was no treatment-related effect to cause a decline in QoL in
the second half of the follow-up.
In conclusion, 5-FU–based intra-arterial chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy improves QoL compared
with observation alone in patients with resected pancreatic
and periampullary cancers. Over a period of 24 months,
patients suffer from significantly less pain and significantly
less nausea and vomiting. This beneficial effect of CAI/RT
is most prominent in the latter half of the follow-up and
probably is caused by a delay in tumor recurrence and
related symptoms. Given the disappointing effect on overall
survival of adjuvant therapy after pancreatoduodenectomy,
QoL during this period is of eminent importance. Impairment in QoL during or after treatment is no longer a reason
to deny patients adjuvant therapies.
