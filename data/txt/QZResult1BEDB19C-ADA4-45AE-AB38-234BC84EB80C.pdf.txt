Abstract:
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)-Akt-mTOR pathway is mutated
at high frequency in human breast cancer, and this pathway is the focus of active
drug discovery and clinical investigation. Trials of personalized cancer therapy seek
to leverage knowledge of cancer gene mutations by using mutations to guide the
choice of targeted therapies. At the same time, cancer genome sequencing studies are
identifying low frequency variants of unknown significance in known cancer genes,
as well as genes of unknown function. We have performed functional analysis of six
non-hotspot AKT1 pleckstrin homology domain mutants identified in recent largescale breast cancer sequencing studies. Three of these mutants cause constitutive
activation of Akt1 in the absence of growth factors, leading to phosphorylation of
downstream target proteins. Like the hotspot E17K mutation, these mutants confer
constitutive membrane localization of Akt1. Finally, the same three mutants showed
oncogenic activity in a cellular transformation assay. The other three mutants were
inactive in all assays. These findings validate novel driver mutations in AKT1, and
extend the number and type of mutations that activate the PI3-kinase pathway in
human breast cancers.

Introduction

unknown significance are being discovered. In the cases
of PIK3CA, KRAS, NRAS, and ERBB2 low frequency nonhotspot mutations have been shown to have transforming
activity using functional assays[3-5].
Mutational activation of the PI3-kinase-Akt-mTOR
pathway is the most frequent oncogenic event in breast
cancer, with a particular predilection for the hormone
receptor-positive subtype of disease. The mTOR inhibitor
everolimus was recently approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for treatment of aromatase inhibitorresistant estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, and a
number of PI3-kinase or Akt inhibitors are under active
clinical investigation in breast cancer.
The hotspot AKT1 E17K mutation occurs in
approximately 3% of primary breast cancers, exclusively
in the estrogen receptor positive subtype[6-8]. The
mutation occurs in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain

The advent of rapid and cost-effective methods
for somatic mutation analysis of cancer has brought the
goal of personalized cancer therapy closer to reality.
As the mutational landscapes of common tumor types
are becoming clear, a number of clinical trials either
completed or in progress are testing the feasibility and
in some cases the efficacy of using tumor mutation data
to guide selection of targeted therapy[1,2]. In some cases
researchers have performed focused sequencing or mass
spectrometric assays directed at known hotspot mutation
sites, such as BRAF codon 600, KRAS codons 12 and 13,
PIK3CA codons 542, 545, and 1047, and AKT1 codon
17. However, as more large-scale genome or exome
sequencing studies and more resequencing studies of
known cancer genes are performed, novel variants of

clones expressing each mutation (Supplemental Figures
1B and 2).
The E17K mutation constitutively activates Akt1
by altering the kinetics and specificity of phospholipid
binding, increasing the binding to PIP2, the more abundant
plasma membrane phospholipid in the absence of PI3kinase activation[9]. In order to determine whether these
novel PH domain mutants similarly conferred constitutive
membrane targeting of Akt1, we generated expression
constructs fusing the PH domains of wild type and mutant
Akt1 proteins with enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP). This system has been widely used to study the
localization and activation of Akt, and the E17K mutant
was shown to localize constitutively to the plasma
membrane with this technique[6]. The AKT1-PH-EGFP
fusion constructs were transfected into MCF-7PIK3CAWT
cells, which were serum-starved and then imaged with a
confocal microscope. As previously reported the E17K
PH domain confers predominant membrane localization
in the absence of growth factors (Figure 2). The mutants
that activate Akt-dependent signaling, L52R, C77F, and
Q79K, also localize to the plasma membrane. We did not
observe significant membrane localization of wild type,
D32Y, K39N, or P42T PH domain fusion proteins.
Although AKT1 is a well characterized oncogene,
we sought to demonstrate a functional effect of the
mutations on cellular transformation. Wild type and
mutant Akt1 proteins, along with empty vector and a
Kras G12V mutant positive control were stably expressed
in Rat1a cells to assess effects on soft agar colony
formation. All of the Akt1 mutants that were active in
signal transduction and membrane localization--E17K,
L52R, C77F, and Q79K--stimulated colony formation
(Figure 3). Despite the increased Akt pathway signaling
observed with over expression of wild type Akt1, we did
not observe an effect on colony formation, suggesting that
this assay is more stringent for Akt1’s oncogenic activity
or that wild type Akt1 may not sufficiently phosphorylate
other proteins critical for anchorage-independent growth.
No colonies were observed with over expression of the
three other mutants.

of Akt1 and confers constitutive plasma membrane
localization in the absence of growth factor stimulation,
leading to increased Akt1 activation and phosphorylation
of downstream target proteins[6,9]. Recent largescale breast cancer sequencing studies have identified
other somatic sequence variants in the PH domain of
AKT1[8,10-13]. We sought to determine whether these
novel AKT1 variants are bona-fide activating mutations.
We show that several, but not all of the reported variants,
confer constitutive membrane localization and activation
of Akt1. These findings have implications for the
evaluation of the cancer-associated somatic mutations and
the implementation of personalized medicine protocols for
cancer therapy.

Results
We chose for study six AKT1 variants reported in
recent breast cancer sequencing studies: D32Y, K39N,
P42T, L52R, C77F, and Q79K. L52R appears to be
a recurrent mutation, as it has been identified in five
independent studies to date, including one reported case
of colorectal cancer[8,11-14]. K39N was identified twice
in a single study, which was also the source for D32Y and
P42T[12]. C77F and Q79K have been reported as single
instances in different studies[10,13]. We expressed all
of these variants, as well as wild type human Akt1 and
the E17K mutant, in a novel derivative of the human
breast cancer cell line MCF-7 created in our laboratory.
MCF-7 cells have the PIK3CA helical domain mutation
E545K. We used somatic cell gene targeting to replace
the mutant alleles with wild type sequence. The resulting
cell line, MCF-7PIK3CAWT shows a drastic reduction in
basal Akt activation and phosphorylation of downstream
Akt targets, such as FOXO1/3 and PRAS40 compared to
parental MCF-7 cells (manuscript in preparation). When
expressed in MCF-7PIK3CAWT the E17K mutant led to
increased activation of Akt under low serum conditions, as
measured by phosphorylation of serine 473 and threonine
308, when compared to empty vector control (Figure 1
and Supplemental Figure 1A). Interestingly, the over
expression of wild type Akt1 also conferred some increase
in activation. The novel PH-domain mutants L52R, C77F,
and Q79K substantially increased Akt phosphorylation,
while D32Y, K39N, and P42T did not activate Akt more
than wild type. Expression of the Akt1 transgenes was
confirmed by immunoblotting for total Akt1. Increased
activation of Akt1 by E17K, L52R, C77F, and Q79K
mutants led, as expected, to increased phosphorylation
of Akt target proteins including FOXO1/3 and PRAS40.
Similar results were observed in Rat1a cells transduced
with the Akt1 variants (Figure 1). Although there is some
variability in the expression levels of the transgenes by
western blotting for Akt1, we confirmed that all of the
transgenes were expressed within a two-fold range by
qPCR, and we also evaluated the activity of single cell

Discussion
We have performed biochemical and functional
characterization of six novel AKT1 pleckstrin homology
domain mutants that have been identified predominantly
in human breast cancers. In addition to the previously
characterized E17K hotspot mutant, three other mutants
were found to be activating, oncogenic mutations: L52R,
C77F, and Q79K. These three mutations led to constitutive
localization of the Akt1 PH domain-EGFP fusion protein
to the plasma membrane in the absence of growth factors.
Increased constitutive Akt activation by phosphorylation
was demonstrated by western blotting, and these Akt1
mutants caused increased phosphorylation of canonical

Akt target proteins, such as PRAS40 and FOXO proteins,
under minimal serum conditions. Finally, these novel
Akt1 mutants behaved as classical oncogenes in a
transformation assay, causing Rat1a cells to form colonies
in soft agar.
Structural studies have suggested that the glutamate
to lysine change at amino acid 17 directly alters the lipid
binding pocket of the Akt1 PH domain[6]. It is not yet
clear how these novel mutations lead to constitutive
membrane targeting. They could, like E17K, cause
structural changes that alter the kinetics and selectivity of
phosphoinositide binding, but we cannot presently exclude
the possibility that they lead to increased membrane
localization through a distinct mechanism. While this
manuscript was under review, Parikh et al published an
analysis of a number of AKT1 mutants, including six of
the seven mutants in this study[15]. In agreement with
our findings they also showed biochemical activation and
oncogenic activity of the L52R and Q79K mutants. The
C77F mutant was not studied in their paper, however.
Parikh et al [15] concluded that Akt PH domain mutants
function primarily by disrupting inhibitory interactions
between the PH domain and kinase domain. They showed
that the E17K and Q79K mutants localized constitutively
to the plasma membrane, although, in contrast to our
findings, they did not observe membrane localization
of the L52R mutant. We cannot explain the discrepancy
between our results for this mutant.
Three other mutants, D32Y, K39N, and P42T, did
not activate Akt in any of the biochemical or cellular
assays. Although it is difficult to completely exclude some
enhanced activity of these mutants, in the aggregate the
lack of signaling over that induced by wild type Akt1,
lack of membrane localization, and lack of activity in

a functional transformation assay argue against D32Y,
K39N, and P42T being activating mutations. In support
of our results, Parikh et al [15] also found no evidence of
increased Akt activity with overexpression of these same
three mutants. Of note, detailed methods were not reported
for how somatic sequence alterations were validated in the
study that originally reported these three mutations[12].
It is possible that they represent sequencing artifacts or
simply non-functional passenger mutations. This finding
illustrates several important issues arising in the clinical
use of genomic data for personalizing cancer therapy.
First, sequencing may identify artifactual or passenger
variants of no significance in known cancer genes. Use of
such mutations to select therapy might result in therapeutic
failure. Second, significant variants in known cancer
genes may be ignored because they occur with lower
frequency in non-hotspot locations. Others have shown
that non-hotspot KRAS and NRAS mutations occurring in
leukemias and rare ERBB2 mutations in lung cancer are
functionally transforming[4,5]. Indeed, two of the AKT1
variants shown to be oncogenic in the current study, C77F
and Q79K, have thus far been identified only once each in
sequencing studies. The use of focused mutation detection
technologies, such as primer extension mass spectrometric
assays or sequencing only single exons (for example,
AKT1 exon 3, which does not contain C77 or Q79),
will miss less common variants and potentially exclude
patients from selection for targeted therapies. Some of
these issues may be resolved with lower cost sequencing
and improvements in sample processing or sequencing
technology that reduce artifacts and allow for less-focused,
unbiased interrogation of the somatic mutation landscape
of patients’ tumors. Until then, the gold standard must
remain functional validation of variants of uncertain

Materials and Methods

Wild type and mutant versions of human AKT1
coding sequence were cloned by PCR either directly from
human cDNA or using PCR mutagenesis to introduce the
various AKT1 mutations. Primer sequences are available
on request. cDNA inserts containing a Kozak consensus
sequence and stop codon were cloned into the EcoRI
and XhoI sites of the LXSN retroviral vector (Clontech).
All sequences were verified by sequencing both strands
at the Johns Hopkins Synthesis and Sequencing Facility.
Constructs were packaged into VSV-G envelope
pseudotyped retroviruses by transiently transfecting 293T
cells using FuGENE 6 (Promega). Stable pools of cells
were selected and maintained in G418 (Mediatech).

Cell Lines
MCF-7PIK3CAWT cells were derived from MCF-7
cells using gene targeting as described, except homology
arms contained wild type sequence from PIK3CA exon
9[16]. Details of their characterization will be published
elsewhere (manuscript in preparation). Compared to
parental MCF-7 cells, the MCF-7PIK3CAWT cells exhibit
greatly reduced Akt activation and Akt-dependent
signaling. The cells were cultured in DMEM (Mediatech)
with 5% FBS (Hyclone) and penicillin-streptomycin
(Invitrogen). Rat1a cells were obtained from Linda SmithResar (Johns Hopkins University) and cultured in DMEM
with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. All cells were
cultured at 37°C at 5% CO2.

Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was prepared from cells using RNeasy
kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNAase I digestion. cDNA
was synthesized with a First-Strand cDNA Synthesis
kit (GE Biosciences). PCR amplification was done
using the MyiQ system (BioRad) with Platinum Taq
polymerase and SYBR green dye (Invitrogen). Primer
