ABSTRACT
While targeted agents are an important part of the treatment arsenal for
colorectal cancer, there is still a lack of efficient small-molecule targeted agents based
on the understanding of pathogenic molecular mechanisms. In this study, curcumin
analog RL71 displayed potent cytotoxicity towards human colon cancer cells with an
IC50 of 0.8 µM in SW480 cells and inhibited xenotransplanted tumor growth in a dosedependent manner. Using affinity chromatography, we identified sarco/endoplasmic
reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA) 2 as the binding target of RL71. Most notably, RL71
demonstrated special binding to SERCA2 at a novel site with the lowest estimated
free energy -8.89 kcal mol-1, and the SERCA2 residues critical for RL71 binding were
identified. RL71 suppressed the Ca2+-ATPase activity of SERCA2 both in vitro and
in vivo, accompanied by the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress leading to
apoptosis and G2/M cycle arrest in SW480 cells. In addition, RL71 showed synergistic
cytotoxicity with the pan-SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin. These results suggest that
RL71 could be a selective small-molecule inhibitor of SERCA2, and that it may serve
as a lead compound for the study of targeted colorectal cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

expense of ATP hydrolysis. SERCA-dependent calcium
transport is the only calcium-uptake mechanism in the ER,
and therefore the regulation of SERCA activity is crucial
to regulating calcium homeostasis in this organelle. Thus
far, SERCA has been identified as a therapeutic target
for prostate cancer and NOTCH1-mutated leukemia [3,
4]. Recent studies have reported that particular SERCA
isoforms have altered expression patterns in various
malignancies including CRC [5-7]. SERCA2 mRNA
overexpression has been found both in cancerous tissues
of CRC patients and in circulating tumor cells of relapsed
CRC patients [8, 9]. Additionally, increased SERCA2
protein expression is significantly correlated with serosal
invasion, lymph node metastasis, and advanced tumor
stage. Consistently, our previous study also demonstrates

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most
important causes of cancer mortality [1]. Other than
surgical resection, current therapy for CRC mainly relies
on traditional cytotoxic agents with limited effects. These
considerations highlight the importance of developing
new treatments based on the understanding of pathogenic
molecular mechanisms.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium homeostasis is
involved in a multitude of signaling pathways that control
cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis [2]. Sarco/
endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPases (SERCAs) act
as Ca2+-ATPases that transfer Ca2+ from the cytosol to the
lumen of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum at the

Identification of SERCA2 as a cellular target of
RL71

that increased SERCA2 protein levels correlate strongly
with tumor progression in patients with CRC [10].
Meanwhile, the loss of SERCA3 expression is an early
event during the multistep process of colon carcinogenesis
[11]. SERCA3 expression is low in colorectal carcinoma
compared with that in the adjacent non-neoplastic mucosa
and adenoma [12]. Thus, increased SERCA2 expression
could be a rational and feasible target for anti-CRC drug
development.
A variety of pan-SERCA inhibitors such as
thapsigargin (TG) have been identified with diverse
chemical structures and binding affinity [13]. Given the
pervasive role of calcium signaling in normal physiology,
only TG and related derivatives have been implemented
in the clinic to date [14]. One strategy might be the
development of isoform-specific small-molecule inhibitors
of SERCA. The natural product curcumin has anti-CRC
activity and is also a SERCA inhibitor that is 6-fold
more effective in inhibiting SERCA2b than SERCA3a
[15]. Therefore, investigating the selective potencies of
curcumin analogs may prove to be useful.
In this study, we identified a potent anti-CRC
compound RL71 (3,5-bis(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylidene)1-methylpiperidine-4-one) from a series of secondgeneration heterocyclic cyclohexanone curcumin analogs.
Using affinity chromatography, we discovered that
SERCA2 is the direct target of RL71. By computational
virtual docking analysis and biological evaluation, RL71
was shown to interact with SERCA2 in the cleft on
the lumenal side of the ER where Lys876 is critical for
binding. The binding of RL71 at this novel site markedly
inhibited SERCA2 activity and induced ER stressassociated apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo.

To investigate the cellular target (or targets) of
RL71, we attempted to generate biotinylated RL71
derivatives. Among 5 curcumin analogs, RL71 (1)
exhibited the strongest cytotoxic effect on SW480 cells
(Figure 2A). RL100 (3), which has a similar chemical
structure except for the lack of a methyl substituent on
the nitrogen, exhibited an approximate 16-fold weaker
cytotoxicity than RL71. On the basis of their structures,
we conjugated biotin to the nitrogen of RL71 to generate
RL71-biotin (7) (Figure 2B). Although RL71-biotin
showed decreased efficacy compared to RL71, RL71biotin still maintained significant cytotoxic activity at 1
µM in SW480 cells (Figure 2C). Total cell extracts from
SW480 cells were used for the affinity chromatograph
experiment. The proteins between 95 and 130 kDa were
specially purified on RL71-biotin-coupled streptavidin
beads and competed with soluble RL71 (Figure 2D). LC/
MS analysis revealed that SERCA2 is a binding protein
of RL71. This finding was confirmed by western blot
analysis using an anti-SERCA2 antibody (Figure 2E).
The interaction between RL71-biotin and SERCA2 could
be competed by RL71. Because of the innate fluorescent
property of RL71, immunofluorescence staining was
performed to identify its subcellular localization. We
observed that RL71 co-localized with SERCA2 (Figure
2F). Additionally, the co-localization of RL71 and ERtracker was revealed in SW480 cells (Figure S1). These
results indicate that RL71 can potentially target SERCA2
in the ER.
To further explore the potential mode of binding of
RL71 to the SERCA2 protein, we employed molecular
docking using AutoDock 4.2. Based on the reported
crystal structure of SERCA1 (Protein Data Bank (PDB)
3ar4) [16], we performed homology modeling for the
SERCA2-RL71 complex, because the SERCA isoforms
share over 75% homology at the amino acid level with
similar domain structures. The model with the lowest
estimated free energy for binding (-8.89 kcal mol-1) was
selected. As shown in Figure 2G, RL71 appears to bind
the cleft between the loop connecting M3 and M4 and the
L78 loop on the lumenal side, possibly sealing the access
pathway at the very surface through hydrogen bonds,
hydrophilic interactions and Van der Waals forces with
a group of residues. Our modeling analysis predicated
that RL71 forms hydrogen bonds with Gln874, Lys876,
Glu877 and Asp878. In addition, RL71’s two phenyl rings
could form Pi-Pi interactions with His278 and Phe872. To
verify the importance of these residues in the binding of
RL71, we generated SERCA2 mutants carrying H278A,
Q874A and K876A mutations. As predicted by the model,
the H278A and Q874A double mutant showed a reduced
affinity for RL71-biotin (Figure 2H). Notably, we hardly
detect any apparent binding between RL71-biotin and the

RESULTS
RL71 shows potent cytotoxicity towards human
colon cancer cells
After a cell-based screen for cytotoxicity using a
series of second-generation heterocyclic cyclohexanone
curcumin analogs, we identified RL71 by its significant
dose-dependent suppression of cell viability compared
with curcumin in a panel of human colon cancer cell lines
(Figure 1A, 1B; Table S1). Out of these cell lines, RL71
showed the lowest IC50 value (0.8 µM) for inhibition of
cell viability in the colon carcinoma line SW480. Timedependent inhibitory effects on cell viability were also
confirmed in colon cancer cell lines SW480 and HCT116
(Figure 1C).

RL71 inhibits SERCA2 activity and induces ER
stress-associated apoptosis

H278A and K876A double mutant. These results indicate
that RL71 possibly binds to SERCA2 at a novel site where
amino acid Lys876 is critical for binding.
Our analysis also showed that the less active analog
RL100 could dock into the same site in SERCA2 and form
hydrogen bonds with side-chains of Gln874 and Lys876.
It was observed that the nitrogen in RL100 could form a
hydrogen bond with Asp281 (Figure S2). This interaction
induces the deflection of the molecule, which broke
hydrogen bonds with Glu877 and Asp878, and weakened
the Pi-Pi interactions of His278 and Phe872.

To test the effects of RL71 on SERCA2 function, we
measured the Ca2+-ATPase activity in the treated SW480
cells. RL71 significantly inhibited the Ca2+-ATPase activity
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). Additionally,
4 µM of RL71 inhibited the Ca2+-ATPase activity by
77%, to a level comparable to 1 µM of TG (Figure 3B).
In contrast, the less active analog RL100 failed to show
any inhibition. To further validate the inhibitory effect
of RL71 on SERCA-associated Ca2+-uptake activity, we
examined intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in treated SW480

cells. In Ca2+-free medium, RL71 induced a steady rise
in cytosolic Ca2+ levels (Figure 3C). When the cells were
pretreated with TG that depletes Ca2+ stores in ER, RL71induced [Ca2+]i increase was abolished (Figure 3D). These
data suggest that the cytosolic influx is due to SERCA
inhibition in ER, but not extracellular calcium influx.
The inhibition of SERCA causes a depletion of the

ER calcium storage pool and a subsequent rise in cytosolic
calcium levels, which results in ER stress leading to
apoptosis [17]. We thus tested the effects of RL71 on
the ER stress-associated apoptotic signaling pathway
in SW480 cells. Hoechst staining demonstrated that
apoptotic changes in morphology occurred, characterized
by typical chromatin condensation and blebbing nuclei in

RL71-treated SW480 cells (Figure S3A). RL71 treatment
caused the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and
increased GRP78, ATF4, and CHOP expression, as well as
the cleavage of PARP, in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
3E). Because CHOP acts as a key transcription factor of
DR5 under the condition of ER stress, we observed that
RL71 treatment indeed caused an increase in DR5 protein
levels (Figure S3B). The up-regulation of DR5, but not
Fas, was confirmed on the surface of SW480 cells after
RL71 treatment (Figure S3C). In addition, 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA), a chemical chaperone reported to be
an inhibitor of ER stress [18], reduced CHOP expression
in RL71-treated SW480 cells (Figure S3D).
To evaluate the involvement of SERCA2 in
RL-71-induced ER stress, we examined the effects of
overexpression and knockdown of SERCA2 on the
expression of ER stress-related molecules in RL71-treated
SW480 cells. SERCA2 (predominantly the ubiquitous
SERCA2b isoform) is always present in cancer and

leukemia cell lines [5, 11, 19]. Real time-PCR confirmed
the predominant expression of SERCA2b, and RL71
showed no effect on SERCA2 expression at either mRNA
or protein levels in SW480 cells (Figures S4A and S4B).
The overexpression of SERCA2b reduced the elevation of
GRP78, CHOP expression and the cleavage of PARP in
RL71-treated SW480 cells (Figure 3F). Moreover, stable
SERCA2 knockdown blocked their up-regulation (Figure
3G, left panel). RL71-associated cell growth inhibition
was also reversed, at least in part, by SERCA2 knockdown
(Figure 3G, right panel).

stress-associated apoptosis
To clarify the mechanism of action of RL71 during
the induction of ER stress, we investigated the effects
of SERCA2 mutants on ER stress-related molecules in

RL71 induces G2 cell-cycle arrest via ER stress

transfected HEK293 cells. Unlike wild type SERCA2b,
the H278A and K876A double mutant failed to reduce
the elevation of GRP78 and CHOP expression upon
RL71 treatment. In contrast, the H278A and Q874A
double mutant blocked the up-regulation of GRP78
and CHOP to a lesser extent than wild type SERCA2b
(Figure 4A). In addition, the H278A and K876A double
mutant did not decrease the cytosolic Ca2+ levels induced
by RL71 (Figure 4B). These results were consistent
with the binding affinities of the RL71-SERCA2 mutant
interaction, indicating that RL71 interacts directly with
SERCA2 in the cleft on the lumenal side of ER where
Lys876 is critical for binding. The identity of this novel
binding site was also supported by evidence showing that
RL71 synergistic cytotoxicity with thapsigargin in SW480
cells (Figure 4C), which binds the E2 form of SERCA in
the transmembrane domain [20].

Treating cells with drugs that target ER calcium
influx results in ER stress, which induces G2 cell-cycle
arrest via mRNA translation of the p53 isoform p53/47
[21]. Measurement of DNA content showed that RL71
indeed increased the percentage of cells in G2/M phase
and decreased the percentage in G0/G1 phase of the cell
cycle in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5A). An average
increase of 60% in the proportion of SW480 cells in G2/M
phase over control was observed upon incubation with
RL71 (0.5 µM) or curcumin (10 µM). The overexpression
of SERCA2b suppressed G2 cell-cycle arrest in RL71treated SW480 cells (Figure 5B). Like TG, RL71 induced
p53/p47 mRNA translation (Figure 5C). These results
demonstrate that RL71 induces ER stress by interfering
with SERCA2 function (Figure 5D).

tumors (Figure 6B). The overall survival of the tumorbearing mice with RL71 treatment was prolonged than
controls (Figure 6C). RL71 did not have significant effect
on the body weight (Figure 6D), as well as the weight of
the liver or spleen (Figure 6E). In addition, Ca2+-ATPase
activity was inhibited by about 40% in the RL71-treated
tumors at 2 mg/kg compared with the olive oil-treated
tumors (Figure 6F), confirming SERCA2 inhibition in
vivo. The cleavage of PARP and caspase 3, as well as
CHOP expression in the tumors, were greatly elevated in
the RL71 treatment groups (Figure 6G). Moreover, the
histochemical and TUNEL staining assay showed apparent

apoptotic induction in tumor tissues in the RL71-treated
group at 2 mg/kg compared with the olive oil-treated
group (Figure 6H). Immunostaining also revealed that
CD31+-marked blood vessels in RL71-treated mice were
greatly decreased compared with controls.

DISCUSSION
While targeted agents are an important part of the
treatment arsenal for CRC, few small-molecule agents that
target intracellular signaling pathways have been shown
to improve the outcome of patients, particularly with

metastatic CRC [22]. It has been postulated that using
predictive biomarkers for CRC could be indispensable
for determining which patients will benefit from these
target-based therapies. Our study and other recent work
demonstrate that increased levels of SERCA2 expression
may be a tumor marker during CRC progression [8-10].
In the present study, we report the discovery of the small
molecule RL71 as a potent anti-CRC compound and
identified SERCA2 as the direct target of RL71.
With a combined approach that included affinity
chromatography, biochemical analysis and structural
modeling, we show that RL71 binds to SERCA2 at the
cleft between the loop connecting M3 and M4 and the L78
loop on the lumenal side of the ER (Figure 2). Classic panSERCA inhibitors thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid
are both reported to bind in the transmembrane domain,
and each induces unique changes to the cytoplasmic
headpiece [23]. Another SERCA inhibitor, 2APB, can
bind close to the cytoplasmic loop between M6 and M7
(L67) and possibly block Ca2+ from entering Ca2+-binding
sites [24]. It is likely that when RL71 binds to this novel
site, it acts as a ‘plug,’ sealing the access pathway/route
by which Ca2+ can enter the ER. Mutation of the residues
in the binding site revealed that the amino acid Lys876 in
the L78 loop was the most critical for the specific binding
of RL71 and also for the activities of RL71 acting on
ER stress-related signaling and the cytosolic Ca2+ levels
(Figures 2 and 4). Comparison of protein sequences of the
L78 loop among the human SERCA 1-3 isoforms showed
that Lys876 is only located in SERCA2 (data not shown).
Because paired inhibitor studies have demonstrated that a
change in SERCA conformation upon binding of a single
inhibitor can favor the binding of a second inhibitor [25],
a uniquely synergistic relationship was uncovered between
RL71 and thapsigargin in cytotoxicity, further confirming
a novel binding site for RL71. In addition, RL71 showed
no inhibitory effect on the mRNA levels of SERCA3
and PMCAs that are located on the Golgi membrane
and also involved in cellular Ca2+ homoeostasis (Figures
S4C and S4D). Pre-inhibition of SERCA activity with
TG completely abolished RL71-induced [Ca2+]i increase
(Figure 3D). Taken together, these results suggest that
RL71 could be a novel SERCA2-specific inhibitor.
In this study, we found that RL71 induces apoptosis
and promotes G2/M cell cycle arrest in SW480 cells
(Figures 3 and 5). These results could be due to the
induction of ER stress by RL71 via inhibition of SERCA2.
With the exception of the unfolded protein response,
imbalance of Ca2+ transfer also induces ER stress [26].
SERCA inhibition causes prolonged elevation of cytosolic
calcium that elicits an ER stress response typified by the
accumulation of unfolded proteins, CHOP induction and
caspase activation [17]. Indeed, a steady rise in cytosolic
Ca2+ levels was detected in RL71-treated SW480 cells.
Meanwhile, the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and
an elevation of GRP78, ATF4 and CHOP were detected.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

SERCA2 overexpression or knockdown impaired the
induction of GRP78 and CHOP as well as the cleavage of
PARP by RL71. It has been recently demonstrated that p53
can interact with SERCA pump at the ER, thus stimulating
Ca2+ accumulation in the ER and allowing for apoptosis
[27, 28]. However, RL71 inhibited SERCA2 activity
and induced p53/p47 mRNA translation, suggesting that
RL71 might induce p53/47-dependent G2 cell-cycle arrest
via ER stress. Consistent with our results, a recent study
showed that RL71 induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis in breast cancer cells [29].
An in vivo test demonstrated that RL71 treatment
dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth and reduced
tumor weight in a SW480 xenograft model, but had little
effect on the body weight as well as the liver or spleen
weight of tumor-bearing mice (Figure 6). These results
indicate that RL71 has relatively low toxicity in animals.
In fact, a previous study showed that RL71 was orally
available following a single oral dose of 8.5 mg/kg [29].
In line with the in vitro results, the inhibition of Ca2+ATPase activity and the elevation of CHOP expression
and apoptotic induction were detected in the RL71treated tumor tissues. Moreover, CD31+ blood vessels
were greatly decreased, indicative of an anti-angiogenic
microenvironment. This finding is supported by evidence
that RL71 inhibits HUVEC cell migration and the ability
of these cells to form tube-like networks [29]. We also
found the inhibitory effect of RL71 on cell migration in
SW480 cells using wound healing assay (Figure S5).
Although SERCA inhibition has been postulated
to provide a potential targeting strategy for anti-cancer
therapy, most small molecule SERCA inhibitors are
non-selective for SERCA isoforms, which prevents
their immediate clinical application. For example, TG
shows toxicity in normal cells in response to SERCA
inhibition [6]. Only when it was used as a prodrug by
conjugation with peptides unique to prostate-specific
antigen enzyme, successful targeted therapy of prostate
cancer was achieved in clinical trial [3]. Curcumin is a
potent SERCA2 inhibitor, but has shown limited clinical
efficacy due to its low bioavailability and low stability in
physiological media [19, 30, 31]. The successful synthesis
of second generation heterocyclic cyclohexanone
curcumin analogs affords good candidates, since they
have enhanced activity and stability in biological medium
compared with curcumin [32, 33]. In this study, RL71
showed potent anti-CRC activity both in vitro and in vivo
over other curcumin analogs, which is possibly related to
the binding affinities for SERCA2. Furthermore, RL71
also repressed the growth of other human cancer cells
(Figure S6). These results implicate its clinical therapy
potential.
In summary, this study demonstrates that curcumin
analog RL71 interacts with SERCA2 at a novel binding
site. Thus binding might contribute to the selective
potency on SERCA2 and impaired toxicity of RL71. The

study also demonstrates the efficacy of SERCA2 as a
therapeutic target for the treatment of CRC and suggests
that RL71 may serve as a tool to study isoform-specific
SERCA inhibition.

The reaction was stirred at r.t. for 16 h. The reaction
was quenched by sq. NH4Cl (20 mL) and extracted
with ethyl acetate (15 mL × 3). The organic phase was
dried by Na2SO4, concentrated, then purified by flash

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
RL71,
RL100
(3,5-bis(3,4,5trimethoxybenzylidene)- piperidine-4-one) , F36
(3,5-bis(3,4-dimethoxybenzylidene)- piperidine-4-one),
LH60 (3, 5- di(3, 4, 5- trimethoxybenzylidene) tetrahydro2H- pyran- 4- one), LH40 (3, 4- dihydro- 4, 6- bis(3, 4,
5- trimethoxyphenyl) - 2(1H) - pyrimidinethione) and
other synthetic curcumin analogs were kindly provided by
Professor Guang Liang from Wenzhou Medical College,
China. These structures were confirmed by comparing
MS, 1H NMR and physical data with those reported in
the literature [32, 34]. The purity is higher than 97%.
Curcumin (>98% purity), 5-Diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) and thapsigargin were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). ER-tracker Red and Fura2/AM were purchased from Beyotime (Nanjing).

MTT assay
Cells were incubated with various concentrations of
RL71 or curcumin at a density of 2×104 cells per well in
96-well plates. In total, 20 µl of MTT (4 mg/mL in PBS)
was added per well 4 h before the end of the incubation.
MTT formazan production was dissolved by DMSO
replacing the medium. The optical density at 570 nm
was measured using a FL × 800 Fluorescence Microplate
Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT).

Target identification of RL71 using affinity
chromatography

Cell culture

As described previously [35], SW480 wholecell lysates were incubated with 10 µM biotin, 10 µM
RL71-biotin or 10 µM RL71-biotin plus 200 µM RL71
and 20 µl streptavidin-conjugated sepharose beads (GE
Healthcare) at 4 °C overnight for 12 h. After an extensive
wash with PBS, the beads were boiled in 2× loading buffer
(100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 1% bromophenol
blue, 20% glycerol and 2% β-mercaptoethanol). Then,
the supernatants were collected and separated with SDSPAGE prior to silver staining. The band between 95 and
130 kD specific to RL71-biotin was excised from the gel
and analyzed with LC/MS, which was performed by the
Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry Proteomics Center
(Shanghai).

Human colon carcinoma cell lines SW480, SW620,
HT29, HCT116 and Caco2 were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection. HEK293 cells were
purchased from the Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology
(Shanghai, China). The cell lines were maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Life Technologies), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/
mL streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

Mice
Eight-week-old NCR-nu / nu (nude) female mice
were purchased from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal
Center. Animal care was performed in compliance with the
guidelines of the Ministry of Science and Technology of
China (2006) and the related ethical regulations of Nanjing
University. All efforts were made to minimize animal
suffering and the number of animals used.

Western blot
Western blot analysis was performed as previously
described [19]. Antibodies to SERCA2 (#9580), PARP
(#9542), cleaved caspase-3 (#9664), DR5 (#3696), CHOP
(#2895), p53 (#2524), ubiquitin (# 3933), and FLag (#
2368) were purchased from Cell Signal Technology
(Beverly, MA), and antibodies to GRP78 (sc-13968),
ATF4 (sc-22800), β-actin (sc-47778) and GAPDH (sc166574) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA). Final detection was performed using the

at 340 nm and 380 nm (5 nm slit) using a TECAN
GENIOS (Model Safire; Tecan, Switzerland). [Ca2+]i
was calculated using the formula: Intracellular free Ca2+
concentration = Kd (F0 / Fs) (R - Rmin) / (Rmax - R). Kd
represents a dissociation constant with a value of 224 nM.
F0 and Fs represent the fluorescence intensity measured
when the Ca2+ is at zero and at the saturation point,
respectively. R is the observed fluorescence ratio. Rmax and
Rmin are the maximum and minimum fluorescence ratios,
respectively. Maximal and minimal fluorescence values
were obtained at the end of the experiment by sequential
addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5 mM EGTA. In some
experiment, Fura-2 loaded cells were pretreated with 5
µM TG for 10 min, followed by stimulation with RL71
in Ca2+-free medium. Changes in [Ca2+]I were monitored.

Confocal microscopy
SW480 cells were incubated with 10 μM of RL71
for 2 h and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4)
for 10 min at 37 °C. Subcelluar localization of RL71
was analyzed following the manufacturer’s protocol. For
analysis of the co-localization of RL71 and SERCA2, the
fixed cells were stained with an anti-SERCA2 antibody
and detected with a secondary antibody. The fluorescent
signals were detected using a FluoViewTM FV1000
confocal microscope (Olympus Corporation, Shinjuku,
Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed by the Olympus Fluview
Ver1.7b viewer (Olympus Corporation, Shinjuku, Tokyo).

were purchased from Neuronbiotech (Shang Hai).
The sequence of SERCA2 shRNA is as follows:
5′-CAAAGUUCCUGCUGAUAUA-3′. SW480 cells
were infected with the viral vectors and then maintained
in puromycin at a concentration of 8 μg/mL. Resistant
cells were allowed to grow for 2 weeks. The cells stably
expressing the shRNA were selected.

The full length of human SERCA2b was subcloned
into pcDNA3.1(+) as previously described in detail [19].
The amphimutation plasmids, pcDNA3.1(+)-mSERCA2b
(His278→Ala; Lys876→Ala) and pcDNA3.1(+)mSERCA2b (His278→Ala; GLN874→Ala), were
constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis using the
appropriate synthetic oligonucleotides and human
SERCA2b cDNA as a template. The resulting FLAGlabeled fragments were inserted into the pcDNA3.1(+)
vector. All of the mutations were confirmed by sequencing.

Analysis of the cell cycle

In vitro binding assay

The cell cycle was analyzed by measuring
propidium iodide (PI) staining using a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). DNA
contents of stained cells were analyzed with ModFit
software (Becton Dickinson).

The HEK293 cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged
SERCA2b or its mutants were lysed in protein lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v)
Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA and proteinase inhibitors) and
centrifuged at 16,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant
was incubated with biotin or RL71-biotin and streptavidin
beads. After an extensive wash with PBS, the bound
fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by
western blotting.

Transplantation of SW480 cells into nude mice
Cultured SW480 cells were washed with and
resuspended in ice-cold PBS. Portions of the suspension (3
× 106 cells in 0.1 mL) were injected into the right flank of
nude mice. Two weeks after the injection, the mice bearing
tumors (an average size of 50 mm3) were distributed into 4
groups (n = 8-10 mice per group). RL71, dissolved in olive
oil, was administered daily for 14 days by intraperitoneal
injection at a dose of 1, 2 or 4 mg/kg. Tumor volumes
were measured every 2 days and calculated using the
following formula: 0.5236 × L1 × (L2)2, where L1 and
L2 are the long and short diameters of the tumor mass,
respectively. Tumor tissues, liver and spleen were excised
and weighted on day 15. In another experiment, survival
tests were made (n = 14 mice per group) as above and

Intracellular Ca2+ measurement
[Ca2+]i was determined using the Ca2+-sensitive
fluorescent indicator Fura-2/AM as previously described
[36]. Briefly, cells were washed with HEPES-buffered
medium (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM Na2HPO4, 1
mM MgCl2, 1 mg/mL glucose and 20 mM HEPES, pH
7.4) and incubated with 2.5 μM Fura-2/AM for 30 min at
37 °C. Then, the cells were washed twice and incubated
with RL71 for another 15 min. Fluorescence intensity was
monitored at 510 nm (5 nm slit) with alternated excitation
