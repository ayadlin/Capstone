BACKGROUND. Determining the outcome of patients with aspergillosis can be
particularly difficult because patients with aspergillosis are at risk for other conditions that mimic this infection. Galactomannan is an Aspergillus-specific antigen released during invasive aspergillosis and is detected by the quantitative
serum galactomannan index (GMI) test.

METHODS. Using a kappa correlation coefficient test (KCC), the strength of correlation was determined between GMI and survival outcome of aspergillosis among

56 adults with hematologic cancer (90% had myeloma) who underwent serial
GMI monitoring until hospital discharge or death.
RESULTS. All 56 patients received antineoplastic therapy (myeloablative followed
by stem cell transplantation [autologous in 21 patients and allogeneic in 3
patients] or nonmyeloablative therapy [32 patients]). The overall correlation
between survival outcome and GMI was excellent (KCC 5 0.8609; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.7093–1.000 [P < .0001]) and was comparable among
neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients (KCC 5 0.8271; 95% CI, 0.6407–1.000
[P < .0001] and KCC 5 1.0; 95% CI, 1–1 [P 5 .0083], respectively).

CONCLUSIONS. The survival outcome of patients with aspergillosis strongly correlated with serum GMI. These findings have important implications for patient
care and clinical trials of mold-active antifungal agents. Cancer 2007;110:830–4.

espite the availability of active antifungal agents, invasive aspergillosis among patients with hematologic cancers continues to
cause high morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization.1–6 Assessing aspergillosis outcome can be particularly difficult because
patients with aspergillosis are at risk for other infections and conditions that may mimic this infection. Precise outcome evaluation is
critical because of its implications for managing patients, such as
the need for invasive diagnostic procedures and/or alternative therapies. Because repeat microbiologic and histopathologic sampling is
difficult in these critically ill patients, conventional outcome evaluation of aspergillosis frequently relies on subjective and nonspecific
variables such as signs and symptoms and nonstandardized operator-dependent radiologic findings. A noninvasive Aspergillus-specific, objective, reproducible, measurable, and quantitative endpoint
is clearly needed. Galactomannan is an Aspergillus-specific antigen

that is hematogenously released during invasive
aspergillosis and is detectable by a commercially
available test.7
We herein analyze the strength of correlation
between serum galactomannan index (GMI) values
and survival among 56 patients with cancer with
aspergillosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was conducted at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences between November 2003
and January 2007 and was approved by the Institutional Review Board.

Inclusion Criteria
Patients with hematologic cancer and proven or
probable aspergillosis was as defined by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of
Cancer/Mycology Study Group (EORTC/MSG)8: 2
consecutive positive serum GMI (optical density
[OD] of 0.5) and sequential (at least weekly) serum
galactomannan testing after diagnosis of aspergillosis, including within 1 week of outcome evaluation
(discharge or death, whichever occurred first).
Patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate during the infectious episode were
excluded.

ture positive and/or with hyphal tissue invasion consistent with aspergillosis) for at least 2 weeks after
the first negative GMI.

Failure
Failure was defined as persistently positive serum
GMI. Patients who died within 2 weeks after normalization of GMI values were considered failures unless
autopsy examination failed to reveal aspergillosis.
We selected serum GMI as an outcome variable
because the test is Aspergillus-specific, objective,
quantitative, and shown to be an accurate measure
of fungal load9 and a validated surrogate endpoint
for aspergillosis outcome.10–12 We also evaluated survival because it is an important and objective clinical
outcome.
Death within 2 weeks of the first negative serum
GMI was considered failure in the absence of autopsy examination, even when other conditions contributed to or were the primary apparent cause of
death (eg, progressive cancer). Patients with aspergillosis have significant mortality, frequently from
causes other than aspergillosis, particularly when
death occurs later during the course of aspergillosis.13 To account for this late nonfungal mortality, we
selected a 2-week cutoff period for mortality after the
first negative GMI.

Testing
Serum galactomannan testing was performed and
reported according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Platelia Aspergillus EIA; Bio-Rad, Redmond, Wash).
Sera with an index 0.5 were retested the following
day and considered positive if the GMI was 0.5.
All patients were prospectively followed by 1 of
the investigators (E.A.). The frequency of GMI testing
was at the discretion of the primary physician until
January 2005, after which testing was performed
daily when serum galactomannan was 0.5. Testing
was continued until death or discharge. The date of
diagnosis of aspergillosis was defined as the date of the
first of 2 consecutive positive serum galactomannan.
Neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1000 cells/lL; severe neutropenia
was defined as an ANC <100 cells/lL. High-dose
steroids were defined as the receipt of dexamethasone at a dose 80 mg.

Statistical Analysis
The kappa correlation coefficient (KCC) test was
used to assess the correlation between GMI values
and survival. Concordance was considered to be perfect when the kappa was 1.0, excellent when 0.75,
good if between 0.4 and 0.75, and marginal if 0.4.14
Statistical significance was defined as P  .05. Survival functions for different galactomannan levels
(OD <0.5 and 0.5) were further estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and compared
by log-rank test. For patients who failed, the survival
time was the actual number of days from the date of
the first positive GMI until death. For patient who
succeeded, the survival time was censored at 2 weeks
after the first negative GMI and computed as 14 days
plus the interval between the first positive and first
negative GMI. SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC) was used for this study.

Outcome Definitions
Success
Success was defined as repeatedly negative serum
GMI values in the absence of new extrapulmonary
lesions of aspergillosis (eg, a skin lesion that was cul-

their underlying disease. The median age of the
patients was 59 years (range, 27–76 years) and 32
patients were male. All 56 patients received antineoplastic therapy within 90 days of the diagnosis of
aspergillosis (myeloablative followed by stem cell
transplantation [autologous in 21 patients and allogeneic in 3 patients] or nonmyeloablative [32 patients]).
Forty-six patients (82%) were severely neutropenic at the time of diagnosis (mean, 10 days; range, 1–
69 days) and 45 had received high-dose steroids
within 60 days of aspergillosis (mean, 20 days; range,
1–57 days). All patients but 1 were not receiving
mold-active antifungal prophylaxis. A mean of 9 serum GMI tests per patient were positive (range, 2–60
tests). Time to first positive serum GMI test after
myeloablative and nonmyeloablative chemotherapy
was 14 days (range, 22 to 44 days) and 23 days
(range, 5–74 days), respectively.
Respiratory tract cultures (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sinus drainage, and/or tracheal
aspirate) yielded Aspergillus species in 11 patients,
whereas septate hyphae, consistent with Aspergillus
species, were identified in biopsy specimens of 4
patients (lungs [2 patients] and sinuses and esophagus [1 patient each]). Thirty patients died at a mean

of 72 days after diagnosis (range, 2–400 days) and serum GMI at death was persistently positive in 12.
Eighteen patients died without evidence of aspergillosis at a mean of 92 days (range, 2–393 days) after
normalization of serum GMI. In 4 of these patients,
Aspergillus antigenemia had resolved within 14 days
of death; these patients were therefore considered
as failures of therapy. One patient underwent autopsy examination that revealed invasive aspergillosis.
Overall, a strong correlation was present between
serum GMI and outcome of aspergillosis (KCC 5
0.8609; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.7093–1.000
[P <.0001]), regardless of neutrophil status at diagnosis
(KCC 5 0.8271 [95% CI, 0.6407–1.000; P < .0001] and
KCC 5 1 [95% CI, 1–1; P 5 .0083]) for neutropenic and
nonneutropenic patients, respectively).
The survival of patients whose serum GMI titers
normalized was significantly better compared with
those whose titers remained persistently positive (P
< .0001) (Fig. 1).

DISCUSSION
Our results indicate that serum GMI values correlate
strongly with aspergillosis outcome in both neutro-

penic and nonneutropenic adults with hematologic
cancer receiving various antineoplastic therapies.
The power of this correlation would have been stronger had autopsy been performed on patients who
died within 2 weeks of their first negative GMI.
Persistently elevated GMI values were associated
with failure and death in contrast to survival and
success among patients whose Aspergillus antigenemia resolved. To our knowledge, this is the first study
to evaluate the correlation between serum GMI and
aspergillosis outcome using an established statistical
test of correlation and the first to correlate serum
GMI results with survival. To our knowledge, this
study is also the largest to date to include serial and
frequent serum GMI monitoring until outcome evaluation.
That serum galactomannan values correlate with
clinical outcome is supported by our findings among
19 neutropenic patients with aspergillosis (6 in this
series) who developed transient deterioration during
neutrophil recovery. Because deterioration coincided
with rapid normalization of daily serum GMI and
neutrophil recovery, we interpreted the transient
deterioration as an immune reconstitution and
inflammatory syndrome and continued the same
antifungal therapy (with the addition of methylprednisone in 2 patients) with complete aspergillosis
response and survival.12
A correlation between the kinetics of serum GMI
and aspergillosis outcome was suggested in 2 previous reports.15,16 Boutboul et al.15 reported that 37
patients with aspergillosis, serum GMI values
increased in the treatment failure group compared
with the group of responders (P 5 .002) and that a
GMI increase 1.0 over baseline value during the
first week of monitoring was predictive of treatment
failure (sensitivity of 44% and specificity of 87%).
Among patients with aspergillosis who had sequential serum GMI, Herbrecht et al.16 reported that a significantly higher response rate was observed among
patients whose GMI normalized (<0.5) between 5 to
9 days after therapy.
In contrast to these 2 studies, we included survival, an important and unambiguous outcome endpoint, and evaluated the correlation between serum
GMI and outcome using an established statistical
test of correlation. Using the same statistical test, we
have also previously shown strong correlation
between survival outcome in aspergillosis and serum
GMI in 228 patients reported in the literature.11 Our
current findings further support the strength of this
correlation and imply that frequent GMI monitoring
after diagnosis of aspergillosis is important to evaluate treatment response. Persistently positive GMI

833

values imply unresolved infection requiring treatment modifications in contrast to aspergillosis
response among those who antigenemia resolves.
These results support our previous findings that
established GMI is a validated surrogate endpoint for
aspergillosis outcome and that the test should be
considered both as an enrollment criterion and an
outcome measure in clinical trials of aspergillosis.
Incorporating surrogate endpoints in clinical trials
offers several benefits including decreasing trial duration and costs and improving trial accuracy, all of
which likely expedite approval of therapies against
aspergillosis.
Our findings are limited by the very small number of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients and should be confirmed and
expanded into other patient populations at risk for
aspergillosis.
We conclude that serum GMI values strongly correlate with survival outcome among adults with hematologic cancer and aspergillosis. This strong correlation
has significant implications for patient care and for the
design of trials of novel antifungal strategies.
