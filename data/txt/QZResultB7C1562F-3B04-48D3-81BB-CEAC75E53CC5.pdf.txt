BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy is a standard option in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of circulating endothelial cell progenitors (CEPs)
and phenotypical circulating endothelial cells (CECs) as surrogate markers of clinical outcome in mCRC patients to
identify responders to bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy. METHODS: A total of 69 patients with measurable mCRC were enrolled in this prospective study. Whole blood samples were analyzed before initiation of treatment and on days 4 and 14. Phenotypical CECs and CEPs were then isolated and enumerated by using flow
cytometry. RESULTS: CEP levels of less than 0.04% on day 4 were significantly associated with longer progressionfree survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (P < .001, P ¼ .002, respectively) as compared with levels of 0.04% or
more. In addition, CXCR4-positive CEC levels of less than 20% at baseline were significantly associated with longer
PFS and OS as compared other indicators investigated (P < .001, P ¼ .002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Levels of
CEPs on day 4 and proportion of CXCR4-positive CECs at baseline were correlated with the prognosis of bevacizumab combination chemotherapy, suggesting that these surrogate markers may play a core role in the selection of

Antiangiogenic agents such as bevacizumab that target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway
have shown promise in the treatment of a variety of malignancies.1 However, clinical biomarkers are needed for quantitative evaluation of the effect of bevacizumab.
VEGF is known to promote the mobilization of bone-marrow–derived circulating endothelial progenitors (CEPs)
and survival by activating antiapoptotic pathways in circulating endothelial cells (CECs),2–4 which may subsequently differentiate into mature endothelial cells.5,6 Recently, CEPs were reported to be involved in tumor angiogenesis in tumor
implantation models7–10 and in clinical studies.11,12 According to several clinical reports, baseline CEC levels in cancer
patients have shown higher values compared with those in healthy controls and were correlated with response and outcome.13–15
The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of CEPs and phenotypical CECs as surrogate markers of clinical outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients to identify responders to chemotherapy with bevacizumab.

Assessment of Biomarkers
Whole blood samples were collected and analyzed at the
following times: before initiation of treatment (baseline),
immediately after completion of 1 course (day 4), and
before commencement of a second cycle (day 14). Blood
samples were drawn into 8.5-mL evacuated tubes (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
Mononuclear cells isolated by density gradient centrifugation were analyzed using the method established by
Duda DG et al.16 Briefly, Ficoll gradient was used to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and
remove red cells and platelets before incubation with antibodies. The following directly conjugated monoclonal
antibodies were used for detection of CECs and CEPs by
4-color flow cytometry in peripheral blood: anti-CD31FITC (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif), anti-CD133PE (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, Calif), anti-CD34-APC
(BD Pharmingen), and anti-CD45-PerCP/Cy5.5 (BD
Pharmingen). The proportions of CECs (CD31-positive
and CD45 negative fractions) and CEPs (CD31-positive,
CD34 highly positive, CD133-positive, and CD45 dimly
positive fractions) were calculated as percentages of the
total number of mononuclear cells after evaluation of at
least 50,000 cellular events. Phenotypical CECs expressing VEGFR1, VEGFR2, Tie-2, or CXCR4 were also analyzed. The proportions of these CEC phenotypes were
calculated as percentages of the total number of CECs.

Observation of CECs and CEPs
For morphological and immunohistological observation
of CECs and CEPs, a small portion of mononuclear cells
was fractionated into CXCR4-positive CECs or CEPs by
using FACSVantage (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes,
NJ). The nuclei of the isolated live CECs and CEPs were
stained with DRAQ5 (Alexis, now part of Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) and then observed by confocal
laser scanning microscopy (FV1000; Olympus, Center
Valley, Penn).

CR indicates complete response; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease;

Statistical Analysis
Kaplan-Meier survival plots were generated based on
CEC levels at each time point of blood sampling, and the
curves were compared by using the log-rank test. The Cox
proportional hazards regression model was used to determine univariate and multivariate hazard ratios for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
A total of 69 patients were enrolled. Patient characteristics
at baseline are summarized in Table 1. Among 69 patients
treated with FOLFOX4 plus bevacizumab assessable for
response, we observed complete response in 2 (3%), partial response in 46 (67%), stable disease in 15 (22%), and
progressive disease (PD) in 6 (8%) during treatment.
Overall response rate was 70%.
Relation Between CEP Levels and Outcome
Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that CEP levels on day 4 were significantly associated with PFS in 30
of the 69 patients in the training set. To identify the level
of CEPs that most clearly distinguished patients responsive to FOLFOX with bevacizumab, thresholds of 0.01%0.20% of the total number of PBMCs on day 4 were systematically correlated with PFS. Median PFS in patients
with levels above or below each threshold differed at
0.04% CEPs of the total number of PBMCs, reaching a
plateau at approximately that level. At this level, the Cox

proportional-hazard ratio signifying the difference
between slow and rapid progression of disease also reached
a peak. Therefore, a cutoff of 0.04% CEPs was chosen to
distinguish patients. The Kaplan-Meier 0.04% CEP
counts were available on day 4 for 30 of the 69 patients in
the training set and for 39 of the 69 patients in the validation set. Because the 2 sets of data were nearly identical,
they were combined to estimate PFS and OS for the entire
study population. Patients with 0.04% or more CEPs on
day 4 had a shorter median PFS (6.7 months; 95% CI,
4.2-9.2 months) than those with less than 0.04% CEPs
on day 4 (19.4 months; 95% CI, 14.2-24.6 months) (P <
.001) (Fig. 1a). Patients with 0.04% or more CEPs on day
4 had a shorter median OS (22 months; 95% CI, 11.432.6 months) than those with less than 0.04% CEPs on
day 4 (P ¼ .001) (Fig. 1b).
Relation Between CEC Phenotype and
Efficacy
Levels of CXCR4 in patients with PD were significantly
higher than in those with no PD. Other phenotypes
showed no differences between patients with PD and
those without (Fig. 2).

Relation Between CEC Phenotype and
Outcome
According to univariate Cox regression analysis, CEC levels at baseline were significantly associated with PFS. To
explore the predictive potential of CEC phenotypes at
baseline, we analyzed the relation between baseline levels
of CEC phenotypes and PFS. Univariate Cox regression
analysis revealed that CXCR4-positive CEC levels at baseline were significantly associated with PFS. On the other
hand, no correlation was observed between baseline
VEGFR1-positive, VEGFR2-positive, or Tie-2–positive
CEC levels and PFS. To identify the level of CXCR-positive CECs that most clearly distinguished patients responsive to FOLFOX with bevacizumab, thresholds of 1% to
45% of the total number of CECs at baseline were systematically correlated with PFS. Median PFS in patients with
levels of above or below each threshold differed at 20%
CXCR4-positive CECs. At this level, the Cox proportional-hazards ratio signifying the difference between slow
and rapid progression of disease also reached a plateau.
Therefore, a distinguishing cutoff of 20% CXCR4-positive CECs was chosen. The Kaplan-Meier CXCR4-positive CEC count was available at baseline for 30 of the 69
patients in the training set and for 39 of the 69 patients in
the validation set. No significant difference was observed
in either PFS or OS in either set. Because the 2 sets of data
were nearly identical, they were combined to estimate
PFS and OS for the entire study population. Patients with
20% or more CXCR4-positive CECs at baseline had a
shorter median PFS (6.7 months; 95% CI, 4.1-9.3
months) than those with less than 20% CXCR4-positive

CECs at baseline (19.4 months; 95% CI, 12.7-26.1
months) (P < .001) (Fig. 3a). Patients with 20% or more
CXCR4-positive CECs at baseline had a shorter median
OS (22 months; 95% CI, 9.2-34.9 months) than those
with less than 20% CXCR4-positive CECs at baseline
(P ¼ .002) (Fig. 3b).
Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to assess the association
between factors of interest and PFS or OS. According to
the univariate Cox regression analysis, liver metastasis,
lung metastasis, CEP levels on day 4, and CXCR4-positive CEC levels at baseline were associated with PFS; furthermore, peritoneal metastasis, CEP levels on day 4, and
CXCR4-positive CEC levels at baseline were associated
with OS (Table 2). To evaluate the independent predictive effect of these markers, multivariate Cox regression
analysis was carried out (Table 3). Levels of CEP on day 4
and CXCR4-positive CEC levels at baseline were the
strongest predictors.

DISCUSSION
Some authors have suggested that CECs are a predictive
marker of clinical outcome in cancer patients treated with
Cancer

bevacizumab-based chemotherapy. In breast cancer, most
studies14,17,18 have reported that high CEC levels at baseline indicate a better outcome than low CEC levels. On
the other hand, in colorectal cancer, low CEC levels at
baseline were reported to indicate a better outcome than
high CEC levels.19,20 These results suggest vascular formation differs according to tumor origin. However, these
differences in results between these 2 types of cancer may
have resulted from differences in the measurement protocols used. A number of methods and protocols are used to
evaluate and count CECs. Two widely used protocols
involve the use of flow cytometry. Duda et al16 reported a
cytometry protocol for phenotypic identification and enumeration of CECs and CEPs using 4 surface markers:
CD31, CD34, CD133, and CD45. This procedure is
believed to allow detection of 0.1% to 6.0% of viable
CECs and 0.01% to 0.20% of CEPs from among a blood
mononuclear cell population and is mainly used in colorectal cancer. Mancuso et al21 reported a protocol for the
phenotypic identification and enumeration of CECs and
CEPs involving 6-color flow cytometry, nuclear staining
with Syto16 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Ore) and 7AAD (Flow Labs, Irvine, UK) and a panel of monoclonal
antibodies, including CD45, CD133, CD31, and
CD146. This protocol has been mainly used in breast cancer. In this study, we selected the protocol of Duda et al.
Willet et al19 reported that CEP levels decreased on
day 3 after initiation of bevacizumab with chemoradiation
in rectal cancer patients. On the basis of this earlier report,
we decided, in this study, to collect samples at 3 days (day
4) after initiation of chemotherapy with bevacizumab. We

found that bevacizumab combination therapy resulted in
a marked and significant decrease in CEP levels on day 4
in comparison with those at the other time points selected.
Levels of CEP on day 4 were the strongest predictor of
PFS and OS. These results suggest that bevacizumab
inhibits bone marrow-dependent tumor vasculogenesis by
reducing endothelial progenitor cells mobilizing from
bone marrow into the peripheral blood and reducing the
proliferation of CEPs. Based on these results, we believe
that if CEP levels do not decrease immediately after initiation of bevacizumab, then the patient must be considered
unresponsive, and that it would not be beneficial to
continue.
These results support the view of Ronzoni et al20
that low CECs at baseline are indicative of longer PFS.
Ronzoni reported that low levels of total CECs at baseline
were correlated with improved PFS, but not significantly
so. However, analysis of resting CEC levels at baseline
revealed a significant correlation with improved PFS,
indicating the potential of phenotypical subgroups of
CECs as biological markers. Torrisi et al18 reported that
VEGFR-1–positive CEC levels showed a significant
increase with bevacizumab-combination treatment. To
explore the predictive potential of CEC phenotypes that
express markers such as VEGFR1, VEGFR2, Tie-2, and
CXCR4 at baseline, we analyzed the relation between
baseline levels of CEC phenotypes and bevacizumab efficacy. We found that a lower ratio of CXCR4-positive
CECs at baseline may indicate a beneficial effect for beva-

cizumab treatment. Xu et al22 reported that bevacizumab
upregulated stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF1alpha) and its receptor, CXCR4, and that higher SDF1alpha plasma levels during bevacizumab treatment were
significantly associated with distant metastasis at 3 years.
Siegel et al23 reported that SDF-1 levels decreased from
baseline in all patients after 8 weeks of bevacizumab, with
an increase noted at time of progression. Their results suggest that SDF-1 is a resistance factor for bevacizumab,
with SDF-1 inducing CXCR4-positive CECs in peripheral blood. Several studies24,25 reported that the SDF-1/
CXCR4 axis may contribute to functional vascular establishment and that the antiangiogenic effects of the blockade of CXCR4 are related to a reduction in the
establishment of tumor endothelium independent of
VEGF inhibition. Therefore, we confirmed differentiation by pathology between CEPs and CXCR4-positive
CECs. Live CEPs sorted by flow cytometry were observed
by using confocal microscopy, and cell surface expression
of CD31 and CD34 was confirmed (Fig. 4a). Similarly,
live CXCR4-positive CECs were also observed. The nuclear/cytoplasm ratio of CEPs was higher than that of
CXCR4-positive CECs (Fig. 4b). The cell nuclei of the
CEPs were mononuclear, but those of CXCR4-positive
CECs were lobulated. These results indicate that the
CEPs and CXCR4-positive CECs were different populations and that the CEPs were more immature than the
CXCR4-postive CECs. Our findings suggest that activation of CXCR4-positive CECs may be responsible for

angiogenesis occurring in cases where the VEGF antibody, bevacizumab, has proved ineffective. However, this
also suggests that resistance to the antiangiogenic effects
of bevacizumab may be neutralized by administration of
SDF-1/CXCR4.
In conclusion, CEP levels on day 4 and proportions
of CXCR4-positive CECs at baseline showed a correlation with prognosis in bevacizumab combination chemotherapy. This indicates the potential of these surrogate

markers in the selection of candidates for bevacizumab
treatment. Further research in the form of large-scale clinical trials is needed, however, to confirm these results.
