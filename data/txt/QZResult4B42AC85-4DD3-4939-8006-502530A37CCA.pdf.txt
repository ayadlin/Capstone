Abstract
Several phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit
inhibitors are currently in clinical trial. We therefore sought to
examine relationships between pharmacologic inhibition and
somatic mutations in PI3K catalytic subunits in estrogen
receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer, in which these mutations are particularly common. RNA interference (RNAi) was
used to determine the effect of selective inhibition of PI3K
catalytic subunits, p110A and p110B, in ER+ breast cancer cells
harboring either mutation (PIK3CA) or gene amplification
(PIK3CB ). p110A RNAi inhibited growth and promoted
apoptosis in all tested ER+ breast cancer cells under estrogen
deprived-conditions, whereas p110B RNAi only affected cells
harboring PIK3CB amplification. Moreover, dual p110A/p110B
inhibition potentiated these effects. In addition, treatment
with the clinical-grade PI3K catalytic subunit inhibitor
BEZ235 also promoted apoptosis in ER+ breast cancer cells.
Importantly, estradiol suppressed apoptosis induced by both
gene knockdowns and BEZ235 treatment. Our results suggest
that PI3K inhibitors should target both p110A and p110B
catalytic subunits, whether wild-type or mutant, and be
combined with endocrine therapy for maximal efficacy when
treating ER+ breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(9):3955–62]

Introduction
Despite the use of adjuvant endocrine treatment, prognosis
remains poor for a significant population of patients with estrogen
receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer (1). The cellular basis for the
efficacy of endocrine therapy treatment is principally through
inhibitory effects on the tumor cell cycle (2) because, unlike
cytotoxic chemotherapy, it has never been clearly shown that
endocrine therapy promotes cell death through apoptosis (3). A
logical approach to improving ER+ breast cancer treatment is,
therefore, to inhibit gene activities that promote survival in the
presence of ER-targeting agents. To address this hypothesis, we

focused on combining endocrine agents with inhibitors of
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) because this pathway promotes
cell survival in several tumor types (4).
Aberrant activation of the PI3K pathway through mutation and
epigenetic silencing of genes within the PI3K signaling cascade
frequently occurs in breast cancer. Gain-of-function mutations in
the PI3Ka catalytic subunit (PIK3CA) occur in f30% of ER+ breast
cancer and, much less commonly, activating AKT1 mutations.
Loss-of-function mutations affect the PI3K negative regulator
PTEN and gene amplification in S6 protein kinase 1 (RPS6KB1) and
AKT2 have also been reported (5–8). Whereas the precise
consequences of these aberrations on the clinical outcome of ER+
disease remain to be fully defined, RPS6KB1 amplification and
PTEN loss are both associated with poor prognosis and PTEN loss
may correlate with endocrine therapy resistance in ER+ tumors
(9–15). In contrast, PIK3CA presents a more complex picture
and mutations may differentially affect prognosis depending on the
affected PIK3CA functional domain (15). Finally, a role for PIK3CB,
the gene encoding the PI3Kh catalytic subunit, has also recently
been postulated in breast cancer, although mutations in this gene
have not been detected (16, 17).
Several PI3K catalytic subunit inhibitors are advancing toward
phase II clinical testing (18). The targets for these agents are
the products of the class 1A PI3K catalytic subunit genes
(PIK3CA, PIK3CB, and PIK3CD). PIK3CA and PIK3CB are believed
to be broadly expressed in breast cancer, whereas PIK3CD gene
expression is more limited (19). We sought to address several issues
related to the clinical development of these compounds. First, it is
not clear if PIK3CA mutation status restricts the efficacy of PI3K
inhibitors. Second, catalytic subunit targeting strategies for
achieving maximum therapeutic effect have not been developed.
Finally, a rationale for the combination of a PI3K inhibitor and
endocrine therapy in ER+ breast cancer has not been established.

Materials and Methods
Human tumor samples. Fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded human breast tumor biopsies for paired array comparative
genomic hybridization (aCGH) and PIK3CB fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were obtained from ER+ breast cancer patients undergoing
preoperative letrozole treatment (20). RNA for transcriptional profiling and
cDNA synthesis (samples z50% tumor) and DNA for aCGH (samples z70%
tumor cellularity) were prepared from sectioned fresh-frozen samples using
RNeasy Mini and QIAamp DNA Micro kits (Qiagen) for RNA and DNA
extractions. Tumor enrichment was done using macrodissection or an

Cell lines were propagated in RPM1 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum
with antibiotics and supplements (50 Ag/mL gentamicin, pyruvate,
10 mmol/L HEPES, and glucose to 4.5 g/L) in a humidified 37jC incubator
containing 5% CO2. To test the effects of estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich)
treatment and withdrawal, cells were maintained in phenol red-free RPM1
1640 containing 5% charcoal-stripped serum (CSS; Invitrogen; CSS medium)
for at least 7 days before small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection or drug
treatments.
Protein extracts. Details are provided in Supplementary Materials and

RNA interference transfection. Nuclease-resistant Stealth duplex
siRNAs (Invitrogen) were used for RNA interference (RNAi) experiments.
The following siRNAs were used: Universal Low GC Negative Control,
PIK3CA siRNAs (target sequence 5¶-GGUGGUGCGAAAUUCUCACACUAUU3¶ for primary siRNA duplex and 5¶-CCCAAGAAUCCUAGUAGAAUGUUUA-3¶
for alternative siRNA duplex), and PIK3CB siRNAs (target sequence

5¶-GCGCUUGAUGGAUUUACUCUGGAAA-3¶ for alternative siRNA duplex).
PIK3CA and PIK3CB siRNA knockdown efficiencies were determined by
reverse transfection of siRNAs into cells and immunoblotting cell lysates
prepared 3 days after transfection. Maximal knockdown efficiency (>70%)
was achieved with 10 nmol/L PIK3CA or PIK3CB siRNA. Transfection
efficiency assessed by the BLOCK-IT fluorescent oligo (Invitrogen) was >90%
in all cell lines.

(P < 0.05), comparisons between specific treatments were made with
Student’s t test. Interactions between PAM50 subtypes or PIK3CA mutation
status and PIK3CA, PIK3CB, and PIK3CD expression were analyzed by t tests
using the SAS version 9.1 Statistical Package (SAS Institute).

Results
p110A and p110B expression in breast cancer cells. The
expression of p110a and p110h was examined in breast cancer cell
lines by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). The panel included ER+
breast cancer cells with activating PIK3CA mutations (MCF-7 and
T47D) or wild-type PIK3CA (HCC712; ref. 11). Both PI3K catalytic
subunit isoforms were ubiquitously present; however, p110a and
p110h expression varied widely. Notably, p110h protein expression
was higher in ER+ cells, with the HCC712 cell line (22) expressing
the most. To determine if increased expression was associated with
gene copy gain, high-resolution aCGH was done. This analysis
revealed PIK3CB copy gain at 3q22.3 in the HCC712 cell line but
not in other cell lines (Fig. 1B). PIK3CB gene copy number in

PIK3CB amplification in primary breast cancer. aCGH
analysis on ER+ primary breast tumors revealed PIK3CB copy gain
in at least one tumor examined (1 of 35), which was confirmed by
FISH (amplification ratio, 2.3; Fig. 1C). In another series of primary
breast cancer samples from a breast tissue microarray, low-level
PIK3CB amplification or copy number gain was observed by FISH
in different breast cancer subtypes (1 ER-, 1 ER+, and 2 ER+/HER2+), suggesting that PIK3CB copy number gain occurs with an
incidence of f5% (Supplementary Table S1). To determine if
PIK3CB was mutant, the PIK3CB helical and kinase domains in 22
primary ER+ breast tumors were sequenced, including the PIK3CB
amplified breast tumor illustrated in Fig. 1C and three breast
cancer cell lines (HCC712, MCF-7, and T47D). No sequence
anomalies were detected.
PIK3CA and PIK3CB are expressed at higher levels in
Luminal B breast cancer in comparison with Luminal A breast
cancer. The variation in PIK3CA and PIK3CB expression observed
in breast cancer cell lines led to an expression analysis in a series
of ER+ primary breast cancers. First, microarray studies were
examined using the PAM50 model (23) to subtype cases into
Luminal A (good prognosis - 31 cases) or Luminal B (poor
prognosis - 44 cases; Table 1). There was strong evidence for higher
expression of both PIK3CA and PIK3CB in poor prognosis Luminal
B tumors when compared with Luminal A tumors. Higher
expression of PIK3CD was also observed in Luminal B tumors,
but the result was less striking. The presence of a PIK3CA mutation
was associated with higher levels of PIK3CA mRNA but not PIK3CB
or PIK3CD.
p110A is the predominant mediator of PI3K signaling in
breast cancer cells, but p110B contributes in a cell line–
restricted manner. To determine the individual effects of PIK3CA
and PIK3CB on PI3K signaling, siRNAs were used to selectively
knock down p110a and p110h expression (Fig. 2A). An analysis of
signal transduction showed that PIK3CB RNAi had no effect on
serum-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in MCF-7, T47D, and MDAMB-231 cells but partially inhibited Akt phosphorylation in
HCC712 cells (Fig. 2A). Knockdown of p110h had no clear effect
on serum-stimulated phosphorylation of S6 protein in any of the
cell lines tested. In contrast, PIK3CA RNAi suppressed serumstimulated Akt phosphorylation in all cell lines tested. S6
phosphorylation was also significantly inhibited in MCF-7 and
T47D cells but not in the HCC712 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines.
Consistent with previous studies (24), we observed reductions in
Akt and S6 protein levels in some experiments, particularly for
MCF-7 cells. To test whether the lack of inhibition of serumstimulated S6 phosphorylation by p110a knockdown in MDA-MB231 and HCC712 cells was due to compensatory signaling through
p110h, dual p110a/p110h knockdowns were done (Fig. 2B).
Combined p110a/p110h knockdown had no clear effect on S6
phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells. However, the combination
partially inhibited S6 phosphorylation in HCC712 cells, indicating
that both PIK3CA and PIK3CB must be inhibited to affect S6 kinase
activation in this cell line. Overall, this analysis indicated that
p110a is the major catalytic subunit that transduces PI3K pathway
signals in ER+ breast cancer cells, but p110h significantly
contributes to pathway activation, particularly in cells containing
higher levels of p110h expression.
PIK3CA and PIK3CB RNAi inhibit ER+ breast cancer cell
growth and survival. To more precisely determine the cellular

response of ER+ cells, the effects of RNAi-mediated p110a and
p110h inhibition were examined under estrogen-dependent growth
conditions (Fig. 3A). PIK3CA RNAi inhibited growth in all cell lines,
ranging from a modest reduction in growth in the MDA-MB-231
cell line to a >90% reduction in MCF-7 cells. In contrast, PIK3CB
RNAi inhibited growth only in HCC712 cells. To determine if
PIK3CA and PIK3CB RNAi promoted cell death, apoptosis was
quantified in the presence and absence of estradiol (Fig. 3B).
Estrogen deprivation alone resulted in no significant increase in
cell death in HCC712 and T47D cells but a modest (significant)
increase in cell death in MCF-7 cells. However, PIK3CA RNAi
resulted in significant activation of apoptosis in estrogen-deprived
MCF-7, T47D, and HCC712 cells. In particular, p110a knockdown
dramatically induced cell death in estrogen-deprived MCF-7 cells,
with f50% of cells dying via apoptosis 7 days after transfection
(Fig. 3B). Consistent with data on cell growth, PIK3CB RNAi
promoted apoptosis in HCC712 cells but not in the other cell lines
examined. In contrast to the effects on ER+ cells, neither PIK3CA
nor PIK3CB RNAi affected the survival of ER- MDA-MB-231 cells.
Importantly, estradiol treatment suppressed the induction of
apoptosis by PIK3CB RNAi in HCC712 cells and PIK3CA RNAi in
all three ER+ cell lines, indicating that the combination of estrogen
deprivation with specific PI3K inhibition caused synthetic lethality.

Combined PIK3CA/PIK3CB RNAi enhances apoptosis in
estrogen-deprived ER+ breast cancer cells compared with
either single-gene knockdown. Next, we examined the effects of
simultaneous inhibition of PIK3CA and PIK3CB on cell growth and
survival using RNAi (Fig. 4A and B). Dual knockdown of p110a and
p110h reduced cell growth by f90% in estrogen-deprived MCF-7
cells, similar to the inhibition of cell growth caused by p110a
knockdown alone (Fig. 4A). In contrast, dual p110a/p110h
knockdowns produced a greater reduction in cell growth in
estrogen-deprived T47D cells (90% inhibition of cell growth) in
comparison with the single-subunit knockdowns (65% growth
inhibition for PIK3CA RNAi and no significant growth inhibition for
PIK3CB RNAi). Combined RNAi was also effective in inhibiting
HCC712 cell growth; however, the growth of ER- MDA-MB-231 cells
was unaffected. Whereas dual p110a/p110h knockdown did not
enhance cell death in estrogen-deprived MCF-7 cells compared
with the marked effect already achieved by p110a knockdown
alone, combined 110a/p110h knockdown resulted in f4-fold
higher levels of apoptosis in T47D and HCC712, similar to that
achieved in MCF-7 cells with single PIK3CA knockdown. In
contrast, the survival of MDA-MB-231 cells was unaffected by dual
p110a/p110h knockdown (Fig. 4B). Importantly, estradiol treatment significantly rescued all three ER+ cell lines from cell death

caused by dual p110a/p110h knockdown. It remained possible that
the induction of apoptosis observed with RNAi knockdown was
caused by off-target siRNA effects and that rescue of apoptosis with
estradiol is not ER-dependent. However, dual p110a/p110h
knockdowns in T47D cells with different siRNA than those used

in Figs. 3A and B and 4A and B also induced apoptosis in estrogendeprived cells. In addition, treatment with the ER-specific inhibitor
fulvestrant abrogated rescue by estradiol, indicating that estradiol
rescue was mediated by the ER (Fig. 4C).
BEZ235 induces apoptosis in estrogen-deprived ER+ breast
cancer cells. The PIK3CA and PIK3CB RNAi experiments in the
cell line panel provide a defined system for examining the potential
of pharmacologic PI3K inhibitors in breast cancer cells. The effects
of BEZ235 (a dual PI3K class 1 catalytic subunit/mTOR inhibitor)
was therefore investigated. BEZ235 has been shown to potently
inhibit wild-type and mutant p110a at low nanomolar concentrations (IC50 f5 nmol/L) and p110h at significantly higher
concentrations (IC50 f75 nmol/L; ref. 25). Signaling effects in the
cell line panel are consistent with a selective p110a inhibitor
(summarized in Fig. 5A). Low concentrations (5 nmol/L) of BEZ235
significantly inhibited the growth of all three ER+ breast cancer cell
lines both in the presence and absence of estrogen (Fig. 5B). In
contrast, only high concentrations (50 nmol/L) of BEZ235 inhibited
MDA-MB-231 cell growth. When the effect of BEZ235 on cell
survival in the presence and absence of estrogen was examined,
marked differences between the three ER+ cell lines emerged
(Fig. 5C). Treatment of estrogen-deprived MCF-7 and T47D cells
with concentrations of BEZ235 as low as 5 nmol/L promoted cell
death. However, effect of BEZ235 on survival was maximal using
5 nmol/L BEZ235 in T47D cells. In contrast, the level of apoptosis in
MCF-7 cells increased with BEZ235 concentration and approached
the levels observed with PIK3CA RNAi at 50 nmol/L. In estradiol
rescue experiments, induction of cell death by 5 nmol/L BEZ235
in MCF-7 cells was completely blocked by estradiol, and in the
presence of estradiol, 4-fold higher doses z20 nmol/L were required
to induce cell death. Remarkably, estradiol abrogated the BEZ235induced cell death in T47D cells at all doses tested. HCC712 cells
were the least sensitive to BEZ235 treatment and required higher
concentrations (z20 nmol/L) to promote cell death under estrogendeprived conditions. However, estrogen did suppress BEZ235induced apoptosis in HCC712 cells such that cell death only
occurred in estradiol treated cells at the highest concentration
tested (50 nmol/L). Consistent with the PIK3CA and PIK3CB single
and combination knockdown results, BEZ235 treatment did not
induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells.

Discussion
+

The role of estrogen in the proliferation of ER breast tumors is
well established. However, the role of estrogen as a survival factor is
less clear. Preclinical studies with the MCF-7 cell line showed that
treatment with antiestrogens or estrogen deprivation increases
apoptosis, as we can confirm (26–28). However, MCF-7 cells are
unusual in this regard because we did not observe estrogen
deprivation-induced apoptosis in the HCC712 or T47D cell lines,
and in the neoadjuvant endocrine therapy setting, treatment did
not increase apoptosis (3, 29). Our data indicate that signaling
through the PI3K pathway may explain these observations because
estradiol promotes survival only when PI3K is inhibited. The

www.aacrjournals.org

presence of two apparently independent cell survival mechanisms,
one PI3K-dependent and one estradiol-dependent, creates an
opportunity for synthetic lethality. At the current time, it is not
known whether estrogen promotes survival through ER-dependent
transcription or by rapid, nongenomic activation of signal
transduction pathways (30, 31). Nevertheless, our data strongly
suggest that the effectiveness of PI3K catalytic subunit inhibitors in
treating ER+ breast cancer will be greatest when combined with
endocrine therapy.
In vitro studies have shown that activated forms of p110a or
p110h transform mammary epithelium (32, 33). Knock-in and
knockout transgenic mouse studies confirmed these findings and
p110h appears to be particularly important for ERBB2-driven

or 10 nmol/L each (20 nmol/L final) of PIK3CA and PIK3CB siRNAs (si CA/CB ).
Cells were left untreated or treated with 10 nmol/L estradiol and growth was
assessed after 10 days. Growth is expressed relative to untreated control
siRNA-transfected cells. Results from four to six experiments per cell line.

breast cancer (16, 34) and in the promotion of proliferation,
survival, and invasiveness in a variety of cancer types (35–37). The
data presented in this study are the first to show PIK3CB
amplification in primary breast cancer and suggest that this
amplification event may promote oncogenesis. Our initial screen
indicates that PIK3CB copy number gain occurs at a low frequency
(f5%) in tumors of breast cancer patients; however, this may be
clinically significant, because breast cancer is common (38). We
also find that PIK3CB is preferentially expressed in Luminal B
breast cancer regardless of gene copy number, indicating that this
isoform is a potentially important therapeutic target, perhaps as a
conduit for the effects of other somatic mutations that activate the
PI3K pathway such as PTEN loss (17). Interestingly, our in vitro
data indicate that PIK3CB supports cell survival in HCC712 cells
under estrogen-deprived conditions, implying that targeted p110h
inhibition could be effective in treating PIK3CB-amplified breast
tumors. However, our data also suggest that both PIK3CA and
PIK3CB may have to be inhibited under these circumstances
because high-level apoptosis only occurred when both catalytic
subunits were targeted. Because PIK3CA is wild-type in HCC712
cells, we also conclude that PIK3CA gain-of-function mutations are
not a prerequisite for the synthetic lethal effect when combining
estrogen deprivation and PI3K inhibition. Additionally, inhibition of
p110h also appears relevant in the presence of a PIK3CA mutation.
T47D cells express modest levels of wild-type p110h as well as a
mutant PIK3CA, raising the question of whether PIK3CB provides
an escape from mutant p110a inhibition. A comparison between
single and combined knockdowns suggests that this is the case,
because both isoforms must be inhibited for maximal synthetic
lethality. MCF-7 cells appear unusual in their extreme sensitivity to
p110a inhibition alone; however, this may possibly reflect the low
levels of PIK3CB expression in this cell line.
BEZ235 is an example of a new generation of PI3K inhibitors to
enter clinical investigation in breast cancer (25). A comparison
between the effects of BEZ235 and RNAi against PIK3CA and
PIK3CB supports the conclusion that BEZ235 functions as a
selective p110a inhibitor at low nanomolar concentrations (25).
However, the apoptotic effect remained very modest in T47D cells,
even at higher doses, consistent with lack of PIK3CB inhibition,
which, based on the RNAi experiments, is necessary for the full
synthetic lethal effect. Estradiol suppresses BEZ235-induced
apoptosis in the three ER+ cell lines, but estrogen rescue was not
as dramatic as that observed in the PIK3CA and PIK3CB RNAi
experiments. The reduced sensitivity to estradiol rescue likely
reflects inhibition of other kinases by BEZ235.
We conclude that there is a strong rationale for the
combination of endocrine therapy and PI3K inhibitors. In terms
of the population of patients suitable for a clinical trial of a PI3K
inhibitor combined with endocrine treatment, the data suggest
that eligibility should not be restricted by PIK3CA mutation
status. Furthermore, the association between PIK3CA and PIK3CB
expression and Luminal B status indicates that the addition of a
PI3K inhibitor may be particularly important in more aggressive
forms of ER+ disease. Finally, PIK3CB is emerging as an important
therapeutic target, whose inhibition is important not only to
increase the efficacy of PIK3CA inhibition but as a target in its
own right, perhaps particularly in the setting of gene amplification. A combined inhibitor with low nanomolar inhibitory
properties for both PIK3CA and PIK3CB may be necessary for
maximal clinical efficacy in combination with an endocrine agent
in the treatment of ER+ breast cancer. However, this clinical

PI3K Inhibition in ER+ Breast Cancer

Figure 5. BEZ235 causes synthetic lethality in estrogen-deprived ER+ breast cancer cells. A, BEZ235 treatment inhibits PI3K pathway signaling in breast cancer cells.
Serum-starved cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) and the indicated concentrations of BEZ235, LY294002 (20 Amol/L), or rapamycin (100 nmol/L) and then
stimulated with 20% fetal bovine serum. Cell lysates were immunoblotted to determine effects on PI3K signaling by phospho-Akt and phospho-S6 antibodies and on
mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling via phospho-ERK (p-ERK 1/2 ) antibodies. Representative results from at least two experiments per cell line. B, BEZ235
inhibits growth of breast cancer cells. Cells in CSS medium were treated without or with BEZ235 in the absence or presence of 10 nmol/L estradiol. Cell growth was
measured after 10 days and is calculated relative to growth in untreated cells. Results from five experiments per cell line. *, P < 0.05, significant differences in growth
between estrogen-deprived and estrogen-deprived drug-treated cells; #, P < 0.05, significant differences in growth between estrogen-stimulated and estrogenstimulated, drug-treated cells. C, BEZ235 promotes apoptosis in ER+ cells. Cells growing in CSS medium were treated with the indicated concentrations of BEZ235
without or with 10 nmol/L estradiol for 7 days. Apoptosis was assessed by counting Hoechst-stained nuclei. Results from four to six experiments per cell line. Significant

treatment strategy may be problematic because systemic
inhibition of both catalytic subunits will cause derangements in
insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis (16, 17, 39, 40), and
metabolic toxicity could be further enhanced by estrogen

deprivation. Nonetheless, it may be possible to pursue this
strategy clinically because endocrine therapy in combination
with a PI3K inhibitor is cytotoxic. Therefore, short-course hightoxicity combinations of PI3K inhibitors with endocrine therapy,
