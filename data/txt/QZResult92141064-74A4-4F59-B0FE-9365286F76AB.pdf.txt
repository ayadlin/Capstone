BACKGROUND. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has often been
selected as a therapeutic option for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The objective of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of repetitive HAIC with high-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin given
for 3 days in patients with advanced HCC.

METHODS. Between January 2001 and December 2004, a total of 41 patients with
unresectable advanced HCC were enrolled. The patients underwent HAIC via the
implantable port system with 5-FU (at a dose of 500 mg/m2 on Days 1–3) and
cisplatin (at a dose of 60 mg/m2 on Day 2) every 4 weeks. Tumor response was
assessed at the end of every 3 cycles.
RESULTS. The median age of the patients was 53 years and 34 patients (82.9%)
had evidence of portal vein thrombosis. In total, 230 cycles of HAIC were administered to the 41 patients, with a median of 6 cycles given (range, 1–14 cycles).

stable disease. The median time to disease progression and overall survival were
significantly longer in the successful disease control group (patients with a complete response, partial response, and stable disease) than in the disease progression group (median of 14.0 months vs 6.0 months; P < .001). Adverse reactions
were tolerable and successfully managed with conservative treatment.

CONCLUSIONS. HAIC with high-dose 5-FU and cisplatin given for 3 days achieved
effective and safe results in patients with advanced HCC. Therefore, repetitive
short-course HAIC with high-dose 5-FU and cisplatin may be useful as an alternative therapeutic option for patients with advanced HCC. Cancer 2007;110:129–

orldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most
common cancer (with 626,000 new cases reported in 2002)
and the third most common cause of death from cancer.1 Patients
with early-stage HCC may benefit from potentially curative treatments, such as surgical resection or percutaneous local therapy.
Unfortunately, the majority of patients with HCC are not candidates
for any curative treatments because of advanced disease at time of
presentation and/or underlying cirrhosis. The majority of patients
with advanced HCC reportedly survive 6 months from the time of
initial diagnosis.2,3 Although variable therapeutic approaches for

these patients may be attempted, to our knowledge,
the treatment strategies for patients with advanced
HCC have not yet been established.4–6
Repetitive hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy
(HAIC) with various chemotherapeutic regimens via
the implantable port system has been reported to be
a useful therapeutic modality for patients with
advanced HCC.7–15 The advantage of intra-arterial
chemotherapy compared with systemic therapy is
pharmacologically explained by the concepts of ‘‘firstpass effect’’ and ‘‘increased local concentration.’’16
Chemotherapeutic agents are delivered in the liver
via the implanted port system and catheter with a
high concentration and lower toxicity compared with
systemic chemotherapy. Several chemotherapeutic
agents (such as cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), epirubicin, doxorubicin, and mitomycin-C) are administered individually or in combination for advanced
HCC. However, to our knowledge, there has been no
consensus to date regarding the most useful agents
to administer by HAIC or their optimal schedule,
dosage, and treatment duration.
Several studies have reported that repetitive
HAIC, comprised of low doses of cisplatin and 5-FU,
in patients with advanced HCC has achieved favorable results.11–15 However, the treatment schemes of
these reports were comprised mainly of protracted
infusions of low-dose cisplatin and 5-FU. This may
require relatively long-term treatment and hospitalization. It is desirable to tailor the treatment scheme
to a shorter duration without compromising tumor
response as well as the incidence of adverse events.
In the current study, we evaluated the clinical utility
of repetitive HAIC with high doses of 5-FU and cisplatin for 3 days, using an implantable port system
in patients with unresectable, advanced HCC, a disease entity that is especially not suitable for other
treatment modalities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Other eligibility criteria included the following: ages
18 to 75 years, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1, ChildPugh class of A or B, preserved organ function
(serum creatinine level 1.5 mg/dL and aminotransferase 5 times the institutional upper limit of
normal), acceptable blood cell counts (absolute neutrophil count of 1500 cells/mm3, a platelet count
75,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin 10 g/dL), and
at least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion. Previous antitumor therapy was allowed if it was performed >8 weeks before enrollment in this study.
Patients were ineligible if they had another concurrent type of malignancy or extrahepatic metastases,
had experienced recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or had any other underlying serious medical
condition that would interfere with participation in
the study. Patient disease was staged using the TNM
staging system, the Okuda staging system, Cancer of
the Liver Italian Program (CLIP), and Japan Integrated
Staging (JIS). The Okuda stage was determined by the
summation of the points for 4 variables including tumor size, ascites, albumin, and bilirubin (stage I indicates a score of 0, stage II indicates a score of 1 or 2,
and stage III indicates a score of 3 or 4). The CLIP
score was calculated by the summation of the points
for 4 variables: Child-Pugh class, tumor morphology,
AFP levels, and portal venous invasion. The JIS score
was obtained by the summation of the tumor stage
score (stage I indicates a score of 0, stage II indicates
a score of 1, stage III indicates a score of 2, and stage
IV indicates a score of 3) and the Child-Pugh class
(Child-Pugh class A indicates a score of 0, Child-Pugh
class B indicates a score of 1, and Child-Pugh class C
indicates a score of 2).
Written informed consent was obtained from
each participant or responsible family members after
the possible complications of port system implantation and HAIC had been explained fully. The
Institutional Review Board of the Severance Hospital
approved this study.

Patients
The study recruited patients between January 1, 2001
and December 31, 2004. The diagnosis of HCC was
made either by histopathologic confirmation or typical radiologic evidence of HCC with elevated serum
levels of a-fetoprotein (AFP) (>400 ng/mL) in the
setting of cirrhosis. Patients with advanced HCC who
were not suitable for surgical resection, liver transplantation, or nonsurgical interventions (such as
percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation, or transcatheter arterial chemoembolization)
because of multiple tumor involving both lobes of
the liver or portal vein thrombosis were enrolled.

Implantation of the Port System
After injection of local anesthetic, the Seldinger technique was used to gain access to the femoral artery.
Arteriography of the celiac trunk and superior
mesenteric artery was performed to visualize the
arterial vascularization of the liver and to evaluate
portal vein patency, respectively. After detection of
the HCC and its feeding artery, the tip of the catheter
(Port-A-Cath1; Deltac, St Paul, Minn) was placed at
the common hepatic artery or proper hepatic artery
under fluoroscopic guidance. The proximal end of
the catheter was connected to the injection port and

the device was implanted in a subcutaneous pocket
in the right iliac fossa. To prevent occlusion of the
catheter, 10 mL (10,000 units) of a heparin solution
was infused via the injection port after each cycle
of chemotherapy. The hepatic angiography via the
port system was performed every 2 to 3 cycles of
treatment.

Study Treatment and Dose Modification
Chemotherapeutic agents were administered via the
implantable port system. Patients received 5-FU
(Choong-wae, Seoul, South Korea; 500 mg/m2 for
5 hours on Days 1–3) and cisplatin (Il-dong, Seoul,
South Korea; 60 mg/m2 for 2 hours on Day 2) into
the hepatic artery. Intravenous hydration was performed before cisplatin infusion to prevent nephrotoxicity and all patients were given prophylactic
antiemetic treatment comprised of 5-HT3 antagonists
and dexamethasone. Treatment cycles were repeated
every 4 weeks until evidence of disease progression,
unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal to continue.
Dose adjustments were made depending on the
toxicity observed with each treatment cycle. The
following cycle of treatment was reduced by 30% in
the case of repeated grade 2 or any grade 3 or 4
toxicity during the preceding cycle. Treatment was
delayed until resolution from any grade 3 or grade 4
toxicity. If a patient required a delay of >4 weeks for
recovery, the patient was taken off the study.
Study Assessments
The primary efficacy endpoint of the current study
was an objective response rate (complete response
[CR] plus partial response [PR]) and the secondary
efficacy endpoints were time to disease progression
(TTP) and overall survival (OS). Pretreatment evaluation included medical history and physical examination, whereas laboratory tests included serum AFP,
chest X-ray, and computed tomography (CT) scan,
which was performed within 2 weeks before the
initiation of treatment. During treatment, a physical
examination (including toxicity assessment, laboratory tests, and chest X-rays) was performed every 4
weeks before each cycle. CT scans were performed
every 3 cycles to evaluate treatment response or, if
needed, for the documentation of disease progression. The tumor responses were classified according
to the World Health Organization tumor response
criteria with the European Association for the Study
of the Liver modifications.6 Patients who achieved
CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) were considered to
have achieved successful disease control. SD was
required to last at least 24 weeks. Anticancer effects

131

were evaluated by examining changes in tumor size
and serum AFP level.
TTP was calculated from the time of study entry
to disease progression. OS was calculated from the
time of study entry to death or last follow-up visit.
All patients who received at least 1 cycle of HAIC
were considered for toxicity evaluation. The observed
toxicities were evaluated according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC;
version 3.0).

Statistical Analysis
The Kaplan-Meier method was used in the analysis
of time-to-event variables and the 95% confidence
interval (95% CI) for the median time to event was
computed. The univariate analysis to identify parameters predictive of survival was performed by computing survival curves according to the Kaplan-Meier
method. For the evaluation of continuous variables,
the cutoff level chosen was their median value. In
this analysis, composed variables such as Child-Pugh
class as well as the TNM, JIS, and Okuda stages were
replaced by their constitutive variables. Significant
parameters of univariate analysis were entered into a
multivariate Cox regression model to identify independent predictors of survival. The chi-square test
and Student t test were used for the analysis of clinical characteristics and prognostic factors between
the successful disease control group (CR 1 PR 1 SD)
and the disease progression group (progressive disease [PD]).
The intensity of the actually delivered dose was
calculated as the ratio of the total dose (expressed in
mg) per meter squared actually received by the
patient divided by the actual total treatment duration
expressed as weeks. The relative dose intensity was
calculated as the ratio of the intensity of the actually
delivered dose to the dose intensity planned by the
protocol.
A P value <.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analysis was performed using commercially available software (SPSS
software [version 13.0]; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).

Patient Characteristics
A total of 41 patients were enrolled into the study
between January 2001 and December 2004. The
baseline characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1. The patients were 29 males and 12

in 4 patients, and alcoholism in 1 patient. Thirty-four
patients (82.9%) had evidence of portal vein thrombosis at baseline. The degree of vascular invasion to
the portal vein was Vp3 or 4 (the first branch or
main portal trunk) in 30 patients and Vp2 (the second branch) in 4 patients. Thirty-three patients
(80.5%) had stage IV-A disease. Twenty-two patients
had 50% of their liver replaced by the tumor.
Okuda staging of the 41 patients demonstrated that
13 patients had stage I disease and 28 patients had
stage II disease. The median serum AFP was 189.40
ng/mL (range, 1.79–83,000 ng/mL), being normal
(<20 ng/mL) in 22.0% of patients and >400 ng/mL
in 41.5% of patients.

Clinical Efficacy
A total of 230 cycles of HAIC were administered with
a median of 6 cycles given per patient (range, 1–14
cycles). The delivered relative dose intensities were
0.92 for 5-FU and 0.90 for cisplatin. Thirteen patients
required dose reductions or treatment delays at
some point in their therapy.
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was
the objective response rate and 34 of 41 patients

(82.9%) were assessable for tumor response. Seven
patients (17.1%) were not assessable for response
due to early withdrawal from the study, but were
included in the intent-to-treat analysis (2 patients
with lung metastases, 2 patients with progressive
liver disease, 1 patient who withdrew from the study
voluntarily, and 2 patients with implantable port
system infections). On intent-to-treat analysis, 9 of
41 patients (22.0%) experienced a PR and 14 patients
(34.1%) experienced SD, whereas 11 patients (26.8%)
developed PD. Therefore, the objective response rate
was 22.0% and 23 patients (56.1%) achieved successful disease control with this treatment approach. The
response characteristics are shown in Table 2.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate
the median TTP at 7.0 months (95% CI, 6.3–7.7
months) and the median OS at 12.0 months (95% CI,
9.7–14.3 months). The 6-month and 1-year cumulative survival rates were 76.5% and 47.1%, respectively
(Fig. 1). The patients who achieved a PR had a
median survival of 16.0 months (95% CI, 7.2–24.8
months), whereas the patients with SD had a median
survival of 14.0 months (95% CI, 11.6–16.4 months).
The OS rate was found to be significantly longer

Prognostic Factors
The prognostic factors affecting patient survival were
analyzed by examining 22 potential parameters
(Table 3). Univariate analysis revealed 6 significant
prognostic factors related to survival: ECOG performance status (P ¼ .001), Child-Pugh class (P ¼ .004),
the presence of ascites (P ¼ .003), the serum albumin
level (P ¼ .044), the serum AFP level (P ¼ .038), and
successful disease control (P< .001). Multivariate
analysis revealed successful disease control (95% CI,
1.626–16.215; P ¼ .005) to be the only independent
predictor of survival.
The comparisons of baseline characteristics between the successful disease control group and PD
group are provided in Table 4. Sex, tumor stage,

Treatment-Related Toxicity
All patients were evaluated for toxicities and implantable port system-related complications. The port
systems were successfully implanted in all patients.
The worst toxicities associated with treatment are
reported in Table 5. Overall, toxicities were transient
and tolerable, and they were successfully managed
by conservative treatment. The hematologic toxicities, including leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, were mild. Two patients experienced grade 3
to 4 thrombocytopenia, but there were no episodes
of thrombocytopenia-related bleeding reported. The

major clinical problems were hepatic toxicities such
as elevation of the aminotransferase or bilirubin
levels. Elevated liver enzymes in documented cases
of HCC progression were not considered to be treatment-related toxicities. Grade 3 elevations in the
aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels
occurred in 4 patients (9.8%) and 1 patient (2.4%),
respectively. Of the patients with elevated aminotransferase due to treatment, 2 patients returned to
normal levels, usually within 1 month of discontinuing treatment. Five patients (12.2%) demonstrated a
 grade 3 elevation in their bilirubin level. Three
patients who later developed persistent hyperbilirubinemia after receiving treatment were withdrawn
from this study. Two of these patients experienced
hepatitis and hyperbilirubinemia due to hepatitis B
virus reactivation, and were received lamivudine
treatment immediately. These toxicities returned to
baseline levels within 2 months. These patients
resumed further HAIC after resolution of toxicity, but
went off the study. One patient experienced cholangitis that was considered to be a 5-FU-related toxicity. This patient had been treated successfully with
percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and antibiotic treatment, and therefore demonstrated
improvement of the biliary stricture that did not
require further therapy after 1 month.
Occlusion of the implantable port system
occurred in 1 patient. The occluded port system was
removed and the patient resumed HAIC after the implantation of new port system. Infection of the port
system occurred in 2 patients. After administering
antibiotics and conservative care, port system infection was controlled, but these patients discontinued
HAIC with the implantable port system.

DISCUSSION
HCC is among the most frequent causes of death
from malignancy and the overall prognosis is very
poor in patients with advanced HCC.1–3 To our
knowledge, a standard therapeutic method for
patients with unresectable advanced HCC has not
been established to date.4–6 Recently, HAIC has been
reported to be a useful palliative therapeutic option
for patients with advanced HCC.7–15 HAIC is delivered directly by means of selective catheterization
into the hepatic arterial branches feeding the tumors.
The rationale for HAIC is the possibility to achieve
increased local drug concentrations at the tumor to
levels not achievable by intravenous systemic treatment, while reducing systemic exposure and therefore side effects. Although several chemotherapeutic
agents (including cisplatin, 5-FU, epirubicin, doxoru-

bicin, and mitomycin-C) have been used for HAIC,
5-FU and cisplatin are the most commonly used
agents in HAIC for HCC.11–15 Ando et al.12,13 reported
the usefulness of HAIC with low-dose cisplatin and
5-FU in patients with advanced HCC with portal vein
tumor thrombosis. The response rate and median
survival duration of 48 patients were 48% and 10.2
months, respectively. The regimen of low-dose cisplatin and 5-FU was given daily 5 days a week for 4
consecutive weeks. Itamoto et al.14 reported outcomes in 7 patients with unresectable or recurrent
HCC with portal vein thrombosis. The overall
response rate of patients to their chemotherapy was
33%, and the median survival duration was 7.5
months. Tanioka et al.15 reported that HAIC with
low-dose cisplatin and 5-FU achieved a response rate
of 47% in patients with advanced HCC. However,
these therapeutic schemes, which were performed
for the most part in an area that is endemic for hepatitis C virus, were comprised of the protracted infusion of low-dose cisplatin and 5-FU for relatively
long periods. Protracted infusion of chemotherapeutic agents may have a negative impact on a patient’s
quality of life (QOL). It is desirable to tailor the treatment scheme to a shorter duration without compromising tumor response as well as the incidence of
adverse events. The practical chemotherapy strategy
is to use the most active drugs at maximum doses
over a relatively short period. In addition, cytotoxic
drugs display a steep dose-response curve, resulting
in a significant increase in tumor response. In contrast to previous reports, we assessed the efficacy of
repetitive HAIC using high-dose 5-FU and cisplatin
during a short treatment course in an area that is
endemic for hepatitis B virus. In the current study,
the overall response rate was 22.0%. The median survival was 12.0 months and the median TTP was 7.0
months. Patients had fewer side effects and generally
tolerated the chemotherapy well. Although efforts to
improve disease remission using dose escalation and
a shorter treatment period would most likely result
in increased chemotherapy-related toxicity, there did
not appear to be a clinical limit to repetitive HAIC
with high doses of 5-FU and cisplatin in the current
study. In addition, compared with previous reports,
patients received HAIC during a short treatment
course and demonstrated satisfactory results. Unlike
potentially curative treatment, the objectives of
administering HAIC in patients with advanced HCC
are survival benefits with palliative therapy and
improvement of the patient’s QOL. QOL is an important measure in patients undergoing palliative therapy. If the chemotherapy treatment period is longer,
it might deteriorate the QOL. A shorter treatment pe-

riod can benefit patients by reducing the cost of
treatment and by improving QOL.
Recently, improvements in an implantable drug
delivery port system have made possible repetitive
HAIC for patients with advanced HCC. Use of the
implanted catheter and port system has simplified
the repetitive, long-term administration of chemotherapy17 and may contribute to improved patient
prognosis and QOL.
In the current study, univariate analysis showed
6 significant prognostic factors that were correlated
with survival: ECOG performance status (P ¼ .001),
Child-Pugh score (P ¼ .004), the presence of ascites
(P ¼ .003), the serum albumin level (P ¼ .044), the
serum AFP level (P ¼ .038), and successful disease
control after chemotherapy (P <.001). However, portal vein tumor thrombosis did not appear to influence the prognosis in patients with advanced HCC
who were treated with HAIC (P ¼ .340). Multivariate
analysis revealed successful disease control to be the
only independent predictor of survival (P ¼ .005).
Several investigators reported that hepatic reserve
function and therapeutic objective response after
HAIC were significant prognostic factors in patients
with advanced HCC who were treated with
HAIC.13,18,19 The results of the current study were
similar to those in the previous reports but, in contrast to other reports, we considered that the successful disease control group contained patients with
SD. There was no significant difference noted in
overall survival between the patients with PR and
those with SD in the current study. Even patients in
whom there was no measurable tumor regression
but in whom disease remained stable during the period of infusion appeared to fare better symptomatically. The majority of these patients demonstrated a
decrease in tumor vascularity without any apparent
tumor regression. In addition, if these patients had
elevated baseline AFP levels, all patients had a correspondingly significant decrease in the serum AFP
level, which supported evidence of a response to
HAIC with 5-FU and cisplatin. Considering the natural doubling time of HCC, an inhibition of tumor
growth in patients with SD was predicted, indicating
the relative efficacy of this method, even in patients
with SD. The precise mechanism awaits further
investigation, but perhaps chemotherapeutic agents
may produce a loss of tumor vascularity in addition
to anticancer effects. HAIC appears to be effective in
controlling tumors, or at least helps to retard tumor
progression. In addition, previous reports have
demonstrated that the pretreatment serum AFP level
was an independent prognostic predictor, regardless
of the treatment adminstered.18,19 It is interesting to

HAIC with High-Dose 5-FU and Cisplatin in HCC/Park et al.

note that Patt et al.20 suggested that the better
response of patients with low serum AFP to 5-FU
may be due to the lower expression of thymidylate
synthase, making the tumor more sensitive to fluoropyrimidines. In the current study, the patients who
achieved successful disease control had a correspondingly significantly low serum AFP level. This
therapeutic approach is worthy of clinical consideration in patients with advanced HCC who have a
good performance status, preserved hepatic function,
and low serum AFP level, even though portal vein tumor thrombosis is noted.
The results of the current study demonstrate the
clinical efficacy of repetitive HAIC with high-dose 5FU and cisplatin given for 3 days in patients with
unresectable advanced HCC. With regard to toxicity,
the majority of patients tolerated the therapeutic
approach well and only mild or transient adverse
reactions were reported. Further comparative randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the
survival outcome of patients with advanced HCC
who are treated with repetitive HAIC.
