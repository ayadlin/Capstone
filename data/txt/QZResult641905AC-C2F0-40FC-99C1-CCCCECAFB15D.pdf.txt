BACKGROUND. Despite the advantages from using aromatase inhibitors (AIs)
compared with tamoxifen for early breast cancer, an unexpectedly greater number of grade 3 and 4 cardiovascular events (CVAE) (as defined by National Cancer
Institute of Canada-Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0] was demonstrated.

METHODS. Phase 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing AI with tamoxifen
in early breast cancer were considered eligible for this review. The event-based
risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were derived, and a test
of heterogeneity was applied. Finally, absolute differences (ADs) in event rates
and the number of patients needed to harm 1 patient (NNH) were determined.
RESULTS. Seven eligible RCTs (19,818 patients) reported CVAE results. When considering all RCTs, the AD of the primary endpoint (CVAE) between the 2 arms
(0.52%), tamoxifen versus AI, was statistically significant (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07–

cantly more frequent in the tamoxifen arm, regardless of the strategy adopted
(RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.42–0.65; P < .0001), without significant heterogeneity
(P 5 .21). An AD of 1.17% and an NNH value of 85 patients were observed.

CONCLUSIONS. According to the results from this meta-analysis, the risk of grade
3 and 4 CVAEs in patients who were receiving AIs was higher compared with the
risk in patients who were receiving tamoxifen, and the difference reached statistical significance. However, the AD was relatively low, and from 160 to 180 patients

Cardiac Toxicity of AIs/Cuppone et al.

B

reast cancer is the second most frequent cause of
cancer-related death for women in the U.S.1 For
30 years, tamoxifen has been the most widely used
endocrine drug for the management of all stages of
breast carcinoma in women with estrogen-dependent
tumors, regardless of age or menopausal status.
Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have demonstrated
superiority to tamoxifen in the setting of metastatic
breast cancer.2–4 Although tamoxifen has been the
cornerstone of treatment for hormone-sensitive early
breast cancer, recently reported randomized clinical
trials (RCTs) clearly indicate the benefit of AI.5–15
These benefits, despite strategic differences across
RCTs and patient populations, are consistent with all
AIs, and previously reported cumulative analyses
have indicated that there is an overall survival benefit to the already documented advantage in diseasefree survival (DFS).7,14 Despite these positive aspects,
toxicity profile and the pharmacoeconomic aspects
should always be taken into account when discussing
new treatment strategies, particularly in the presence
of small benefits. Previously presented or published
data ‘alarmed’ medical oncologists because of a trend
(sometimes statistically significant) toward increased
differences in cardiac events.10,15 Those concerns are
enhanced by the lack of a clear mechanism by which
these drugs are supposed to act.16,17
The presumed pathogenesis of cardiac pathology
induced by AIs remains unclear, although it has been
proposed that some pathways (reduction of circulating estradiol and alterations in lipid metabolism) are
involved.16,17 In fact, in head-to-head comparisons of
AI and tamoxifen, it is not possible to distinguish
between this supposed higher risk and the proposed
cardioprotective effect of tamoxifen (attributed to its
favorable impact on lipid profile).18 It also is important to note that the only trial comparing an AI with
placebo did not identify a difference in cardiac
events.19 Moreover, tamoxifen’s protective effect
seems to be proportional to the duration of treatment
and, in itself, remains controversial,18 thus, raising the
question of whether AIs actually are cardiotoxic or tamoxifen is cardioprotective. Furthermore, the need to
evaluate AI-versus-tamoxifen trials to determine
whether there are any differences in cardiac events
comes to the surface. To gain a better understanding
of whether adjuvant AIs increase the cardiovascular
risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer and to quantify this risk, we performed a metaanalysis based on the published data to date.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our comprehensive analysis was conducted in 4
steps: 1) definition of the endpoints (definition of the

261

question which the analysis was designed to answer),
2) definition of the optimal search strategy, 3) definition of the criteria for the selection of the eligible
trials, and 4) a detailed description of the statistical
methods used.7,20

Endpoints Definition
Analyses were conducted to determine significant
differences in primary and secondary endpoints. The
primary endpoint was grade 3 and 4 cardiovascular
adverse events (CVAEs), as defined by National Cancer Institute of Canada-Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 2.0). Secondary endpoints were 1) thromboembolic adverse events (TEAEs) and 2) cerebrovascular adverse events (CBVAEs).
Search Strategy
The trial publication deadline for inclusion in this
analysis was February 2007. Publications of trials
were searched first; then, congress websites and/or
specific reports were screened for updates every
month. In particular, updates of RCTs were gathered
through searches of the Medline (PubMed, available
at URL: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed), American
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (available at
URL: www.asco.org), European Society for Medical
Oncology (ESMO) (available at URL: www.esmo.org),
Federation of European Cancer Societies (FECS)
(available at URL: www.fecs.be), and San Antonio
Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) (available at URL:
www.sabcs.org) web sites (each site was last accessed
on February 28, 2007). The following keywords were
used for the searches: adjuvant hormonal therapy,
aromatase inhibitors, AIs, tamoxifen, endocrine, exemestane, anastrozole, letrozole, aminoglutetimide,
switch, early, breast cancer, review, cardiovascular, ischemic, myocardial infarction, cardiotoxicity, metanalysis, meta-analysis, pooled analysis, randomized,
phase 3, comprehensive review, systematic review. In
addition to the Internet, the reference chapters of
reviews and original articles also were scanned to
search for any missing update of trials. Furthermore,
lectures of major meetings (ASCO, ESMO, European
Congress on Clinical Oncology, and SABCS) that had
‘adjuvant therapy for breast cancer,’ ‘early breast cancer,’ or ‘cardiotoxicity of endocrine therapy’ as topics
were checked. No language restrictions were applied.
Trial Identification Criteria
We gathered phase 3 prospective and randomized
trials that were published as full articles in peerreviewed journals or that were presented at the mentioned meetings up to February 2007 in which previously untreated patients had undergone curative

surgical resection for early breast cancer and were
randomized to receive hormonal therapy with either
an AI (experimental arm) or tamoxifen (control arm)
for a total of 5 years of treatment. For entry criteria,
all trials that explored adjuvant AI compared with tamoxifen either as an ‘early-switch’ strategy (after 2–
3 years of tamoxifen) or as an ‘up-front’ strategy
(starting at the time of surgery and planned for
5 years) were considered eligible. Phase 2 randomized trials were excluded, because such trials are
not designed to compare drugs or strategies. Phase 3
trials that adopted AIs with different design, such as
‘late-switch’ trials (which adopted a placebo in the
control arm after 5 years of tamoxifen), were
excluded from the analysis. The AI arm was considered the experimental group, and the tamoxifen arm
was considered the control group.

Data Extraction
Within each study arm for all trials, the number of
grade 3 and 4 CVAEs, TEAEs, and CBVAEs were
obtained. All data were reviewed and computed
separately by 2 different independent investigators
(E.B. and D.G.).
Data Synthesis
The log of relative risk ratios (RRs) was estimated for
each studied endpoint, and 95% confidence intervals
(95% CIs) were derived.21 By using this method, it
was possible to apply both a fixed-effects model and
a random-effects model according to the inverse variance and Mantel-Haenzel methods. To test for heterogeneity between trials, the Q statistic was used.
Patients were accounted for and filled in on a 2 3 2
tables using intention-to-treat assignment.7,22 The
significance of the heterogeneity test suggested a
preference for using random-effects estimation as an

appropriate evaluation of the results. Absolute differences (ADs) for each endpoint were calculated (ie,
AD 5 exp [RR  log (control rate)] 2 control rate).23
The number of treated patients needed to harm 1
patient (NNH) was determined (NNH: 1/[(AD)/
100]).24 The results are depicted in all figures as conventional meta-analysis Forest plots. The pooled
analysis calculations were accomplished by using the
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software, version
1.0.23 (CMA; Biostat, Englewood, NJ).7,22 The project
was funded by the Italian National Ministry of
Health. To reduce heterogeneity across the different
generations of AIs, the analysis was carried out in
consideration of 2 different populations: 1) overall
analysis (ie, considering all AIs regardless of generation), and 2) third-generation AIs (CVAE-New).

RESULTS
Selected Trials
Seven trials (19,818 patients) were identified that were
eligible for inclusion in this analysis5,6,8,10–13,15,25
(Fig. 1). Two trials with similar design were pooled together and published as a single report (Austrian
Breast Cancer Study Group 8/German Adjuvant Breast
Cancer Group trial [ABCSG8/ARNO]).13 All trials have
been published fully, and 3 of them recently were
updated with more mature follow-up.8,9,11,12,26 Two
trials were designed with the up-front strategy (11,108
patients),8,9 and 5 trials were designed with the early
switch strategy (8974 patients).5,6,10,11,13,25,26 The median follow-up ranged from 28 months to 68 months.
Trial characteristics are listed in Table 1. There were no
disagreements between investigators at the time of
data extraction and analysis.
Combined Analysis
All results obtained are displayed in Tables 2 through
5 and in Figures 2 through 4. RRs should be interpreted as follow: RRs >1.0 indicates more events in
the AI arm (ie, higher risk), and RRs <1.0 indicate
more events in the tamoxifen arm.
Primary endpoint
All trials (5 1 2 combined trials; 19,818 patients)
were evaluable for the primary endpoint. When all
AIs were considered, a significant AD of 0.52% in the
overall population was observed in CVAEs for
patients who received AIs (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07–
1.60; P 5 .007) (Fig. 2), which corresponds to an
NNH of 189 patients (Table 2) without significant
heterogeneity. When evaluating only the trials with
third-generation AIs (ie, anastrazole, exemestane,
and letrozole), the difference between the 2 arms

P 5 .038) (Fig. 3) without significant heterogeneity
(P 5 .19) and with an AD of 0.57%, which corresponds to an NNH of 165 patients (Table 3). No significant differences were observed between the 2
arms for either the early-switch strategy or the upfront strategy (Tables 2 and 3).

Secondary endpoints
The overall incidence of TEAEs, as expected, was
higher in the tamoxifen arm (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.42–

0.65; P < 0.0001; heterogeneity test: P 5 .21) (Fig. 4).
This risk translates into an AD of 1.17%, with an
NNH of 85 patients (Table 4). Similar results were
observed with both the early-switch strategy (RR,
0.33; 95% CI, 0.19–0.56; P 5 .00,004) (Fig. 4) and the
up-front strategy (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46–0.73;
P 5 .00,001) (Fig. 4), which translate into ADs of
0.92% and 1.39%, respectively. Thus, the NNH for
TEAEs was 85 patients and 72 patients for the earlyswitch and up-front strategies, respectively. With
regard to CBVAEs, although a strong trend in favor of

AIs was observed particularly with the up-front strategy (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58–1.003; P 5 .053) in a homogeneous manner, the low number of events most
likely was insufficient to attain statistical significant
(Table 5).

tory of cardiac disease, this issue is more controversial in survival outcome, as discussed previously.7
The main bias in interpreting this analysis (and
all RCT cross-sectional reading) is the difference in
reporting and defining cardiovascular events and cardiac risk factors among these RCTs (Table 1). A variety
of cardiovascular endpoints or predefined parameters
have been used in the majority of AI therapy trials,
and there are differences in how they are reported.
Indeed, in the Breast International Group 1–98 trial,
the events are defined as adverse cardiac events
(ischemic cardiac disease and cardiac failure) plus all
cardiovascular events9,15; whereas, in the Arimidex,
Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination trial, the events
are defined only as ischemic cardiovascular events.12
In the latest Italian study, cardiac toxicity was
reported as cardiovascular disease; whereas, in the
previous Italian trial, it was reported as cardiovascular
events.5,25 In the Intergroup Exemestane Study trial,
events were defined as cardiovascular events (ie, ischemic cardiac; such as myocardial infarction and angina) plus other cardiac events, whereas only
myocardial infarction was reported in the pooled
analysis of ABCSG8 and ARNO.10,13,26 Because of these
and other differences across RCTs, any conclusion
should be interpreted with caution.
To gain a better understanding of the issue of
overall vascular toxicity, TEAEs and CVAEs also were

DISCUSSION
The results from this meta-analysis indicated that
previous reports with shorter follow-up overestimated the cardiovascular ischemic risk in patients
who were receiving AIs because of the dilution of the
events in a larger patient cohort and the updates of
recent RCTs.10,15 Indeed, the trial with the short median follow-up at the time of this analysis reported
the least favorable RR for AI in terms of cardiac toxicity, as illustrated in Figures 2 and 3.13 It is interesting to note that, if this trial were excluded from our
analysis, then the RR in the early-switch strategy in
terms of CVAE would be less in favor of tamoxifen,
although it always would remain nonsignificant (data
not shown).
Although the number of CVAEs was greater for
patients who were receiving AI, this translates into a
low risk (approximately 0.50%), and the NNH would
be >180 patients (Table 2). Although it is questionable to compare different strategies because of the
different time of assignment during the natural his-

investigated (Tables 4 and 5). Tamoxifen, as expected
and as well documented, is associated with a significant increase in thromboembolic risk by from 1% to
1.4%, as demonstrated previously in patients with
early and advanced disease.3,27 Although they were
not addressed (and perhaps not powered) for subgroup analyses, differences appear to exist between
strategies, as shown in data and plots. Indeed, this
risk appears to be time-dependent, ie, the longer the
patients are exposed to tamoxifen (such as the upfront strategy), the higher the incidence. This lengthof-tamoxifen-exposure effect is present across all
endpoints (Tables 2–5, Figs. 2–4). Although there was
a trend toward significance (more evident in the upfront strategy), CVAEs were not increased in patients
who were receiving tamoxifen (Table 5); the lack of
difference (especially in the up-front strategy)
appears to be related to the small number of events.
What is relevant for clinicians and patients is
whether these events lead to deaths.28 Similarly, the
overall outcome of those patients who experience a
cardiac event is not actually reported across the
examined RCTs; thus, a cumulative analysis from a
literature-based approach is not possible.
The introduction of new drugs or new treatment
strategies into clinical practice should take into
account the long-term safety profile data with
updated and mature follow-up. A recent systematic
review that approached this topic suggested that it is
necessary to interpret early data (which can lead to
stopping a trial prematurely) with care and skepticism.29 Many studies over the past 50 years have
demonstrated that negative alteration in lipid profile
is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular
disease: The lipid alterations may include increases
in cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein a, and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and a decrease in
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. It has been
implied that the negative to null effect of AI on lipid
metabolism plays a role in the cardiotoxicity of AI,
although no definitive evidence is available.13–15 In
addition, steroidal AI actually may improve triglycerides and apolipoprotien A. Therefore, do AIs damage
cardiovascular health directly compared with to tamoxifen, or are the differences observed caused by
the proposed protective effects of tamoxifen (mainly
because of positive lipidic effects)? This still is
debated and has been explored in other meta-analyses.17,30 The lack of increased CVAEs with letrozole
compared with placebo in the MA.17 trial suggests
that the differences between AIs and tamoxifen in
other trials are caused by tamoxifen-based protection
rather than because AIs actually increase cardiac
events.17,19 Because placebo-controlled trials in the

prevention setting previously demonstrated the exact
safety profile of tamoxifen without confounding factors, the ongoing RCTs in the very same setting will
clarify definitively the real safety outline of AIs without biases provided by the disease itself or by comparative treatment.17
In analyzing these data, the difference in cardiac
events between AI and tamoxifen does seem to exist,
although it appears to be minimal. This needs to be
balanced against the relevant toxicities of tamoxifen,
such as thromboembolism, stroke, and endometrial
carcinoma,7,27 The effects of these toxicities on overall survival also must be considered. In addition,
regarding the bone toxicity of AIs, promising data
regarding the protective role of bisphosphonates to
mitigate fracture risk in AI therapy are emerging in
the literature.31,32
Although the impact on clinical practice and
research given by systematic reviews and meta-analyses33 is relevant, there are many drawbacks to literature-based approach.34 The difference in median
follow-up between trials, given the hypotheses
regarding its role in late toxicity profiles of new
unknown drugs, is a crucial issue for this topic. A
patient-based meta-analysis gathering the database
from each individual trial is able to answer this specific question, but it is time-consuming, costly, and
generally requires years to complete.34,35 Given these
general biases of this meta-analytic approach, if we
consider the specific mentioned biases, such as differences in the definition of cardiac toxicity (Table 1),
and the lack of an eventual link between these data
and deaths, then our results should be carefully evaluated.
Notwithstanding all of the limitations of a literature-based meta-analysis, our results provide updated data regarding the risk of grade 3 and 4
cardiac events with adjuvant AI therapy in patients
with breast cancer. Although the difference is present, it appears lower than was suspected previously.
Hence, clinicians need to balance these differences
in cardiac toxicity with the improved toxicity observed with AI regarding the thromboembolic risk,
