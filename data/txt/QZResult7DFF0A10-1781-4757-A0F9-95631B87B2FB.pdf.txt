Abstract
Aromatase inhibitors (AI) are rapidly becoming the first
choice for hormonal treatment of estrogen receptor-A
(ERA)–positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women.
However, de novo and acquired resistance frequently occurs.
We have previously identified a lysine to arginine transition
at residue 303 (K303R) in ERA in premalignant breast
lesions and invasive breast cancers, which confers estrogen
hypersensitivity and resistance to tamoxifen treatment.
Thus, we questioned whether resistance to AIs could arise
in breast cancer cells expressing the ERA mutation. As
preclinical models to directly test this possibility, we
generated K303R-overexpressing MCF-7 cells stably transfected with an aromatase expression vector. Cells were
stimulated with the aromatase substrate, androstenedione,
with or without the AI anastrozole (Ana). We found that
Ana decreased androstenedione-stimulated growth of wildtype cells, whereas K303R-expressing cells were resistant to
the inhibitory effect of Ana on growth. We propose that a
mechanism of resistance involves an increased binding
between the mutant receptor and the p85A regulatory subunit
of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K), leading to increased PI3K activity and activation of protein kinase B/Akt
survival pathways. Inhibition of the selective ‘‘addiction’’ to the
PI3K/Akt pathway reversed AI resistance associated with
expression of the mutant receptor. Our findings suggest that
the K303R ERA mutation might be a new predictive marker of
response to AIs in mutation-positive breast tumors, and that
targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway may be a useful strategy for
treating patients with tumors resistant to hormone therapy.

Introduction
Despite the clinical efficacy of the aromatase inhibitors (AI),
many ERa-positive breast tumors initially fail to respond (de novo
resistance), or resistance develops during treatment leading to
disease progression (acquired resistance). To understand resistance
mechanisms, several laboratories have developed in vitro cell line
models to study the molecular changes associated with long-term

estrogen deprivation (1–5). AI resistance has also been examined
using aromatase-overexpressing MCF-7 breast cancer cell line
models grown as xenografts in athymic nude mice (6), or breast
cancer cells made resistant to AIs via long-term treatment with
these drugs (7, 8). These models suggest the hypothesis that
resistance to endocrine therapy may be through the acquisition of
estrogen hypersensitivity, whereby low subphysiologic levels of
estrogens remaining after estrogen deprivation are sufficient for
maintenance of tumor growth. One unifying feature which has
emerged is a retained mitogenic role for ERa (9). Recently,
intracellular cross-talk between ERa and several signal transduction pathways have been shown to be associated with endocrine
resistance (10, 11).
We have previously identified a frequent somatic mutation at
nucleotide 908 of ERa (A908G) in premalignant breast lesions
and invasive breast cancers (12, 13). This mutation results in a
lysine to arginine transition at residue 303 (termed K303R), that
confers hypersensitivity to estrogen (12, 14). We hypothesized
that such a mutant could provide a continuous mitogenic
stimulus to the breast even during phases of low circulating
hormone, such as menopause, thus affording a proliferative
advantage especially during treatment with AIs. Here, we present
a new model of resistance to endocrine therapy, whereby the
expression of the A908G ERa mutation conferred resistance to
the AI anastrozole (Ana). We speculate that inhibition of the
phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways may
represent a promising therapeutic strategy for hormone-resistant
cancers that are ‘‘addicted’’ to these pathways due to mutation
of the ERa target.

product was subcloned into the Spe I/Not I sites of the pZeoSV2-vector
(Invitrogen). The resulting pZeoSV2-aromatase expression vector (pZeoArom) sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Generation of yellow
fluorescent protein (YFP)–tagged expression constructs, YFP-WT and
K303R-ERa, has been previously described (14).
Cell culture. MCF-7 parental breast cancer cells were cultured as
described (14). MCF-7 wild-type (WT) and K303R ERa-expressing cells were
generated as described (15). MCF-7 parental and YFP-K303R ERa clones
were stably transfected with the pZeo-Arom expression vector using Fugene
6 reagent according to the manufacturer (Roche). Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) or MCF-7 Arom-expressing pools, stably transfected with YFP-WT
ERa and YFP-K303R ERa expression vectors, were also used.
Aromatase activity assay. Aromatase activity was evaluated using a 3Hwater release assay using 0.5 Amol/L of [1h-3H]-androst-4-ene-3,17-dione as
substrate (16). The incubations were performed at 37jC for 1 h. The results
were expressed as fmol-pmol/h/mg protein.
Tumor xenografts. All animal studies were carried out according to the
guidelines and with the approval of the Baylor College of Medicine Animal
Care and Use Committee. Female nude ovariectomized athymic mice were
injected with MCF-7 YFP-WT and YFP-K303R ERa–expressing cells or
MCF-7 Arom 1 and K303R Arom 1–expressing cells as described (17).
Animals were supplemented with estrogen tubing releasing f80 pg/mL, or
supplemented daily with injections of the aromatase substrate androstenedione (AD; 100 Ag).
Cell proliferation assays. Seven hundred cells were plated into 96-well
plates in phenol red–free MEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal
bovine serum (FBS). After 24 h, cells were treated as indicated. Nine days
later, proliferation was assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagent following the recommendations of the manufacturer. Soft agar anchorage-independent growth assays
were performed as previously described; data shown are the mean colony
numbers of three plates and is representative of two or three independent
experiments (18).
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses. Cells were starved
in serum-free MEM for 48 h and treated as indicated before lysis (15). For
coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we used 500 Ag of total cellular
protein and anti-ERa (1:50) or anti-p85 (1 Ag) antisera overnight and
protein A/G with rotation at 4jC for 2 h. Protein extracts from tumor
tissues were prepared by homogenizing the tissue in lysis buffer
supplemented with 10% glycerol. Equal amounts of extracts were subjected
to SDS-PAGE as described (14). Blots shown are representative of two or
three individual experiments.
PI3K activity. PI3K was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates with
p85 antibody and the amount of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate
(PIP3) produced was assessed in a competitive ELISA (Echelon Biosciences).
ERA transactivation assays. Cells (50,000/well) were plated in phenol
red–free MEM with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS in 24-well plates,
and then cotransfected with 0.5 Ag of an ERE2-tk-luciferase reporter
plasmid, plus 1 ng of the respective ERa expression plasmid and 50 ng of
CMV-h-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control using Fugene 6 reagent.
After 6 h, cells were treated as indicated for 18 to 24 h. Luciferase activities
were determined as described (14).
Apoptosis assays. Cells were seeded into six-well plates (105/well) in
phenol red–free MEM with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS for 48 h and then
incubated with different treatments for 72 h. Apoptosis was measured using
the Cell Death Detection ELISA Kit (Roche). Data are representative of two
independent experiments performed in triplicate.
Statistical analyses. Data were analyzed by Student’s t test using the
GraphPad Prism5 software program.

Results
The K303R ERA mutation and estrogen hypersensitivity.
We have previously described ERa-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells
that overexpress either WT ERa or the K303R ERa mutation (15).
Cells expressing the K303R ERa mutant receptor expressed a 66 kDa

www.aacrjournals.org

endogenous ERa protein, along with a 96 kDa receptor representing
the exogenously added mutant tagged with YFP (Fig. 1A). We have
shown that K303R ERa mutant overexpression conferred increased
sensitivity to estrogen using in vitro growth assays (12). To confirm
these findings, we examined the ability of increasing concentrations
of estradiol (E2) to induce anchorage-independent growth, which
reflects in vivo three-dimensional tumor growth. Basal (E2) mutant
colony number was 2.9-fold higher (Fig. 1B); both cell lines exhibited
estradiol-induced dose-response growth. Growth stimulation was
not observed with low E2 (10 12 mol/L) in parental cells, whereas low
E2 enhanced the growth of mutant cells.
To determine if low estrogen might favor the growth of mutant
cells, we examined xenograft tumor models. Cells were injected
into female mice supplemented with 80 pg/mL of estradiol,
representing low premenopausal levels (Fig. 1C). K303R ERa
tumors grew faster than the WT ERa tumors (P = 0.0466). Thus,
expression of the mutant generated an estrogen hypersensitive
phenotype in vitro and in vivo.
Expression of the mutation and AI resistance. Estrogendeprived MCF-7 cell lines (1–3, 19), and breast cancer cells resistant
to aromatase inhibitors (AIR) have been generated (6, 7); one
hypothesis emerging is that resistance may result from adaptive
estrogen hypersensitivity or estrogen-independent ERa activation.
This hypothesis led us to question if the K303R ERa mutant might
play a role in AIR due to its estrogen-hypersensitive phenotype.
To test for AIR , cells were stably transfected with an aromatase
cDNA expression vector. Figure 1D shows aromatase protein levels
in a vector control clone (MCF-7 V), one clone stably expressing
aromatase (MCF-7 Arom 1), and two clones coexpressing the YFPK303R mutant ERa along with aromatase (K303R Arom 1 and
Arom 2). These cells overexpressed aromatase protein and activity
at f1,000 times more than vector control cells (0.032 versus 29–65
pmol/h/mg protein).
We next evaluated proliferative responses in anchorage-independent assays (Fig. 1E). K303R Arom 1–expressing cells exhibited
significantly enhanced control growth compared with WT ERa
MCF-7 Arom 1–expressing cells, and growth was further increased by
AD treatment. MCF-7 Arom 1 and K303R Arom 1 cells were also
injected into mice to monitor xenograft growth; a significant increase
in the growth of AD-treated mutant tumors was seen (Fig. 1F).
To investigate whether the mutant hypersensitive phenotype
could cause AIR , we examined the effects of the nonsteroidal
aromatase inhibitor Ana on cell growth (Fig. 2A). Growth of MCF-7
vector (V) cells was significantly enhanced by E2, but as expected,
they did not respond to AD treatment. AD treatment enhanced
growth to the same extent as E2 in MCF-7 Arom 1 cells, as well as
K303R Arom 1–expressing cells. Ana treatment decreased ADstimulated growth at f40% in MCF-7 Arom 1–expressing cells, but
had no effect on the growth of mutant cells.
To extend the MTT data, we performed anchorage-independent
soft agar growth assays (Fig. 2B). E2 and AD treatments enhanced
colony numbers, and treatment with Ana completely abrogated
AD-stimulated growth of MCF-7 Arom 1 cells. In contrast,
basal colony number was increased f10-fold in K303R Arom 1
and Arom 2 clones, and Ana was unable to inhibit AD-induced
colony growth.
Because it was possible that overexpression of exogenous ERa
alone might stimulate cell growth and contribute to the AIR
phenotype, we also transfected MCF-7 Arom 1–expressing cells
with an expression vector for YFP-WT ERa. Aromatase and
exogenous YFP-ERa levels are shown (Fig. 2C, top). Pools

expressing exogenous WT or mutant receptor were evaluated in
soft agar assays (Fig. 2C, bottom). The basal growth of K303R
ERa Arom pools (P) was significantly higher than WT pools.
Inhibition of aromatase activity by Ana caused a significant
reduction in AD-stimulated growth in WT ERa Arom cells, but Ana
was unable to reduce AD-stimulated mutant cell growth, confirming our stably transfected clones results. In the mutant pool AD +
Ana stimulated growth compared with AD treatment alone, which
may be a variable clonal effect. We also generated stable pools of
YFP-tagged ERa in ER-negative, aromatase-positive CHO cells
(Fig. 2D). Ana did not reverse AD-stimulated growth in CHO
mutant cells, confirming that the AIR phenotype was associated
with expression of the mutant in a number of different cellular
backgrounds. We also examined whether there was crossresistance to the nonsteroidal AI Exe (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Exe treatment decreased AD-stimulated growth of mutant cells,
although Exe was unable to reduce their high basal nonstimulated
growth. Aromatase activity was effectively reduced by both Ana
and Exe treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1B). We are currently
examining the mechanism(s) associated with the partial response
to Exe in mutant-expressing cells.
K303R ERA aromatase cells exhibit enhanced PI3K/Akt
signaling. Previous studies have revealed the importance of

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (11). June 1, 2009

increased MAPK activity and/or PI3K signaling in the adaptation
of ERa-positive cells to long-term estrogen deprivation or AI
treatment (1–4, 6). To explore the mechanisms underlying the
mutant AIR , we focused on short-term signaling events. Cells were
treated with increasing AD concentrations (Fig. 3A) for different
times (Fig. 3B). MCF-7 Arom 1 cells showed a low basal level of
pAkt that was increased in a dose-dependent and time-dependent
manner by AD treatment. In contrast, mutant cells showed
elevated constitutive pAkt that was not further increased by AD;
no changes in phosphorylated p42/44 ERK1,2/MAPK levels were
seen (data not shown). pAkt levels were also increased f4-fold in
mutant tumor xenografts compared with MCF-7 Arom 1–overexpressing tumors (Fig. 3C).
We next investigated the expression and activation of Akt in cells
treated with Ana (Fig. 3D). MCF-7 Arom-1 cells showed slightly
increased levels of pAkt following AD treatment that was reduced
with Ana cotreatment, whereas K303R Arom 1 and Arom 2–
expressing cells showed elevated constitutive pAkt that was
unaffected by Ana. It has been shown that treatment with the
antiestrogen ICI182,780 leads to a rapid down-regulation in ERa
levels (20); there were no changes in pAkt with short-term
treatment (Fig. 3E). Treatment with ICI182,780 (1–48 h) reduced
ERa levels in MCF-7 Arom 1, but not basal pAkt; in contrast,

K303R ERa Mutation and Aromatase Inhibitor Resistance

ICI treatment resulted in a decrease in pAkt levels in mutant cells,
concomitant with a reduction in YFP-ERa levels (Fig. 3F). This
suggests that activation of pAkt may be related to nongenomic
activities of the mutant receptor, as short-term treatments did not
block Akt phosphorylation, but are known to block ERa’s genomic
activities (21).
ERa can bind to the p85a regulatory subunit of PI3K and activate
PI3K/Akt signaling in cells (22). We have previously shown that the
mutant ERa receptor exhibits altered binding with several nuclear
receptor coregulatory proteins, such as the TIF-2 coactivator, and
for the ERBB2 (HER2) oncogene when compared with WT ERa
(12, 18). We next examined whether the mutation might alter
binding with the PI3K subunit p85, and alter PI3K activity. ERnegative CHO cells were transiently transfected with YFP-tagged
receptors, and coimmunoprecipitation studies were performed.
Enhanced binding of the p85 subunit to mutant receptor in the
absence of ligand was observed (Fig. 4A). Equal amounts of lysates
of CHO transfected cells (CHO + WT or K303R) or stable pools
(CHO WT or K303R P; Fig. 4B) were immunoprecipitated with an
anti-p85 antibody, and kinase activity was determined. Mutant ERa
either transiently expressed or in stable pools significantly induced
PI3K activity. We also performed an in vitro PI3K assay in our stably
transfected MCF-7 clones, and found constitutively increased PI3K
activity in the mutant cells, which was abrogated by PI3K inhibitor

LY294002 treatment (Fig. 4C). We also detected elevated constitutive pAkt in CHO cells transiently or stably expressing the mutant
receptor (Fig. 4D). These data support a mechanism whereby
enhanced binding of the regulatory subunit of PI3K results in
enhanced downstream Akt signaling in the mutant cells.
Phosphorylation of ERa by a number of kinases is an important
mechanism by which ERa activity can be regulated (23–25).
Akt kinase phosphorylates ERa at serine (S) 167. Increased levels
of pS167 YFP-ERa were found in K303R mutant cells (Fig. 4D), and
the mutant increased ERE-transcriptional activity f8-fold
(Fig. 4E). ERE activity was inhibited by treatment with either the
PI3K inhibitor LY294002, or the antiestroogen ICI182,780. Thus, Akt
may serve as a functional link between nongenomic and genomic
ERa activities, engaging in a bidirectional cross-talk that may set
up a vicious cycle between these two growth-regulatory pathways
and augment signaling between them.
K303R ERA-aromatase cells exhibited altered apoptotic
responses. Akt/protein kinase B signaling is involved in the
control of survival and apoptosis (26, 27), and AIs induce cell death
by apoptosis (28). This suggestion led us to question if the K303R
ERa mutation could protect cells from apoptosis induced by Ana,
providing these cells with a potential survival advantage. We first
evaluated PARP proteolysis, and found a reduction in the basal
levels of the proteolytic form of PARP (85 kDa) in mutant cells

under control conditions (Fig. 5A). AD treatment reduced its levels
in a time-dependent fashion in WT and mutant cells, but this
reduction was less pronounced in WT cells. E2 was able to reduce
PARP-cleavage levels only in mutant cells, suggesting that reduced
apoptosis may underlie their hypersensitivity. Ana treatment of
MCF-7 Arom 1–expressing cells increased proteolysis compared
with AD treatment; cleavage was unchanged in mutant cells (Fig.
5B). In addition, we found an increase in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio in
K303R Arom 1–expressing cells, which was further increased with
AD and Ana treatments (Fig. 5C and D).
To determine the levels of cellular apoptosis, we also used ELISA
cell death detection assays (Fig. 5E), and found that AD-stimulated
mutant cells exhibited a lower apoptosis compared with MCF-7
Arom 1–expressing cells, suggesting that the proliferative advantage provided by the mutation may be achieved by a decreased
apoptotic response of these cells. In addition, Ana treatment
induced an increase in cell apoptosis only in MCF-7 Arom 1 cells.
We hypothesize that mutant-expressing cells are resistant to AIinduced cellular apoptosis.
The AIR phenotype is dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway.
We next addressed whether activated PI3K/Akt signaling may be a
functional mechanism of resistance to AI therapies using PI3K/Akt

inhibitors. To define the effective dose, mutant cells were treated
with different doses of these agents and analyzed for pAkt. LY
(10 Amol/L), PI-103 (1 Amol/L), Akti1/2 (1 Amol/L) effectively
blocked basal Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 6A). We then performed
soft agar growth assays. LY completely inhibited mutant proliferation, whereas it induced a slight reduction in the growth of MCF-7
Arom 1 cells (Fig. 6B). Similar results were obtained using the
PI-103 inhibitor in another mutant clone (K303R Arom 2; data not
shown). Because PI3K inhibitors affect not just all three Akt
isozymes, but also other PH domain-containing molecules (29), we
tested a specific Akt inhibitor, Akti1/2 (Fig. 6C), and found that
basal, AD-stimulated and Ana-stimulated growth was inhibited by
f30% in MCF-7 Arom 1–expressing cells, whereas growth was
inhibited by >90% in mutant cells. These results suggest that Akt
signaling is essential for the growth of mutant cells, but may not
play an important role in the growth of WT cells.
We also used a MEK1 inhibitor (PD98059) in soft agar assays
(Fig. 6D); antiproliferative effects were not observed and PD
treatment was unable to reverse the AIR mutant phenotype. These
results confirm that the p44/42 Erk1,2/MAPK pathway was not
involved in the AIR mutant phenotype. We also used ICI182,780,
and it suppressed the colony growth of both cell lines, indicating

that ERa expression remained important in their growth regulation
(Fig. 6D).
We next evaluated the effects of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on
apoptosis using an ELISA cell death detection assay (Fig. 6E), and
found that LY treatment in MCF-7 Arom 1 cells showed similar
apoptosis induction as Ana-treated cells (1.7-fold increase),
whereas inhibitor treatment of mutant cells was able to induce a
3.6-fold increase in the apoptotic rate compared with AD, and most
significantly, after Ana treatment. We conclude that the mutation
provides a selective dependency on the PI3K/Akt survival pathway
for sustained proliferation and/or survival. We suggest that
inhibition of this potential pathway addiction may provide an
effective means to reverse AIR associated with the expression of
K303R ERa mutation.

Discussion
Despite significant advances in the treatment of breast cancer
following the introduction of AIs (30, 31), de novo and acquired
resistance remains a major clinical concern. Here, we report that
expression of the K303R ERa mutant conferred resistance to the AI
anastrozole, and show that resistance occurs through a constitutive

www.aacrjournals.org

activation of the PI3K/Akt prosurvival signaling pathway to which
the mutant cells have become addicted for maintenance of growth.
Breast cancer cells can adapt in response to the selective
pressures exerted by exposure to estrogen deprivation therapy by
developing enhanced sensitivity to the proliferative effects of
low estrogen levels (32). A number of laboratories have developed
in vitro models with long-term estrogen deprivation (1–5), and they
propose a dynamic interplay between growth factor signaling and
ERa action. Letrozole resistance involves cross-talk between the
HER2 growth factor receptor pathway and ERa, leading to
activation of Erk1,2/MAPK and ERa phosphorylation (6). Herein,
we show that a naturally occurring mutation of ERa, termed
K303R, conferred hypersensitivity to estradiol, and show that the
mutant ERa in aromatase-expressing cells exhibited enhanced
growth in basal conditions, as well as with AD treatment. We found
that the hypersensitive phenotype associated with mutant
expression resulted in the acquisition of resistance to the AI
anastrozole. The growth of mutant cells was suppressed by
fulvestrant treatment, indicating that ERa remained essential for
growth.
There is extensive evidence to support the role of HER2 as a
mediator of resistance to endocrine therapy (33), but we did not

detect increased HER2 levels in our aromatase-overexpressing
mutant cells (data not shown), highlighting the uniqueness of our
resistance model. K303R ERa-expressing cells exhibited constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and increased
binding to the p85a regulatory subunit of PI3K that led to
increased PI3K activity and downstream Akt phosphorylation. The
increased levels of phosphorylated Akt in mutant-expressing cells
were associated with a specific increase in ERa pS167, a known Akt
phosphorylation site. In agreement with these data, we found that
the mutant had enhanced transcriptional activation, which was
inhibited by treatment with either the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, or
the antiestrogen ICI182,780. This suggests that Akt may serve as a
functional link between both cytoplasmic and nuclear ERa
functions, resulting in an integrated bidirectional signaling that
promoted and sustained the proliferation of mutant cells. Despite
the extensive disruption in the genome of cancer cells (34, 35),
there are examples whereby the reversal of only one or a few of
these abnormalities can profoundly inhibit the cancer growth (36).
PI3K/Akt inhibition drastically inhibited the growth of mutant cells
suggesting an exquisite ‘‘dependency’’ of the mutant cells on the
PI3K/Akt pathway for maintenance of AIR.
It has been reported that estrogen deprivation, antiestrogen, or AI
treatment induced apoptotic cell death (28, 37). We found a lower
frequency of apoptosis in AD-stimulated K303R ERa-expressing
cells, suggesting an altered apoptotic response in these cells. In

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (11). June 1, 2009

addition, Ana treatment induced a significant increase in cell
apoptosis in WT cells, but no changes were observed in the apoptotic
response of mutant-expressing cells. It has been proposed that Bcl2/Bax protein ratios may determine whether a cell will undergo
apoptosis (38). We found an increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio in the mutant
cells that was further increased after AD and Ana treatments,
confirming a potential survival advantage for the mutant receptor
cells.
There are relatively few mutations which have been reported in
the ERa gene, which is surprising because many clinical resistance
mechanisms involve mutation of the target. The K303R ERa
mutation was associated with poor outcomes in univariate
analyses, and its presence was correlated with older age, larger
tumor size, and lymph node–positive disease, all factors
associated with worse outcomes (13). Four other studies did not
detect the mutation in invasive cancers (39–42), but our studies
suggest that the detection method used might be insensitive.
However, the K303R mutation has been reported, but at low
frequency in invasive breast tumors by Conway and colleagues
(43). Molecular analyses have shown that the mutated arginine at
the 303 position allows ERa to be more highly phosphorylated by
protein kinase A (14) and Akt kinase signaling.6 We have

previously shown that overexpression of the K303R ERa mutation
in ERa-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells conferred estrogen
hypersensitivity in vitro (12, 14), and decreased sensitivity to
tamoxifen treatment when engaged in cross-talk with growth
factor receptor signaling (18). Here, we provide a unique model of
endocrine resistance, whereby expression of the K303R ERa
mutant receptor conferred resistance to the AI anastrozole. The
potential mechanisms of resistance include cellular strategies to
evade apoptosis, and increased proliferation through an enhanced
cross-talk between the mutant receptor and the PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway.
There are two major clinical implications of our study. First,
because K303R mutant cells may escape from growth inhibition
when treated with AIs, genetic assays for the mutation might offer
a new predictive marker for hormonal response. Second, these data
