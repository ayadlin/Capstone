BACKGROUND: The authors assessed the use of herbal medicine by Middle Eastern patients with cancer, as reported by their oncology health care professionals (HCPs). Herbal products identified by the study HCPs were evaluated for potential negative effects.
METHODS: Oncology HCPs from 16 Middle Eastern countries received a 17-item questionnaire asking them to list 5 herbal products in
use by their patients with cancer. A literature search (PubMed, Micromedex, AltMedDex, and the Natural Medicine Comprehensive
Database) was conducted to identify safety-related concerns associated with the products listed. RESULTS: A total of 339 HCPs completed the study questionnaire (response rate of 80.3%), identifying 44 herbal and 3 nonherbal nutritional supplements. Safety-related
concerns were associated with 29 products, including herb-drug interactions with altered pharmacodynamics (15 herbs), direct toxic
effects (18 herbs), and increased in vitro response of cancer cells to chemotherapy (7 herbs). CONCLUSIONS: Herbal medicine use,
which is prevalent in Middle Eastern countries, has several potentially negative effects that include direct toxic effects, negative interactions with anticancer drugs, and increased chemosensitivity of cancer cells, requiring a reduction in dosedensity. Oncology HCPs
working in countries in which herbal medicine use is prevalent need to better understand the implications of this practice. The presence
of integrative physicians with training in complementary and traditional medicine can help patients and their HCPs reach an informed

INTRODUCTION
The use of herbal medicine by patients with cancer may result in potentially negative effects that can impact the efficacy
and safety of conventional anticancer treatments. Greater than 35% of patients with cancer in the United States report
using herbal medicine during chemotherapy, with this rate exceeding 50% in developing countries.1,2 Between 20% and
70% of patients using complementary and traditional medicine (CTM), including herbal agents, are often reluctant to
disclose this practice to their conventional medical professional.3 This results from an anticipated negative response (either
disapproval or a general lack of interest).3
In light of the increased use of CTM by patients with cancer, many of the leading cancer centers have begun to provide patients with an evidence-based consultation and subsequent CTM treatments, including herbal medicine. However,

Risks Associated With Herbal Use/Ben-Arye et al

to the best of our knowledge, only a few of these centers
offer this service as part of standard care in their conventional oncology setting.4 At the same time, many oncology health care professionals (HCPs) report that they do
not believe they are adequately informed about herbal
medicine, and lack competence in this field in their daily
practice.5 As a result, many patients are seeking advice
from family members, friends, or nonconventional medical practitioners.6,7Nevertheless, many patients expect
conventional HCPs to provide up-to-date information
and guidance on CTM treatments, including herbal medicine, as part of the medical consultation.8 Greater than
85% of patients have reportedly admitted they would discontinue the use of herbal agents if a potentially harmful
herb-drug interaction was suspected.9
Much has been published regarding the potential for
interactions between herbal products and conventional
drugs, especially in the field of oncology. The research has
focused primarily on the effects of herbal components on
the induction10 and bioavailability of chemotherapy
agents,11 and is almost exclusively preclinical, in which cancer cell lines and animal models are exposed to combinations of herbal products and chemotherapeutic agents.12,13
The potential for herb-drug interactions is attributed
primarily to the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome
P450 (CYP450) system, of which CYP3A4 is the most
predominant.14 Other factors such as the transporter
P-glycoprotein have been examined as well.15 The findings
of this research are often contradictory, demonstrating
either antagonistic effects,16 additive effects,17 synergy,18 or
no interaction whatsoever.19 Clinical research has revealed
several directly toxic effects of herbal products,20,21 as well
as alterations in the pharmacokinetics of anticancer
drugs,22 although these findings are often contradictory as
well.23
The conflicting findings with regard to herb-drug
interactions have precluded the development of accepted
guidelines. As a result, there are those in the medical profession who have issued an across-the-board recommendation
to avoid the use of all herbal products during active anticancer treatment.24 Although this may be prudent, it is a
somewhat unrealistic solution for oncology HCPs working
in communities in which herbal medicine is an integral
part of societal norms. Abstention from herbal medicine
may not be acceptable to patients, their family members, or
their community. This approach also may impede
physician-patient communication25 and may be regarded
as unethical and disrespectful to patient autonomy.26
The Middle East is a region with a high affinity for
CTM, including the use of herbal medicines, which has

been reported for >60% of patients receiving adjuvant or
palliative care.27 We found that Middle Eastern oncology
HCPs have a generally positive attitude toward the integration of CTM in supportive cancer care.28 In the current study, we collated and analyzed additional data from
this cohort, examining specific herbs listed by HCPs as
being used by their patients undergoing active oncology
treatments. We then searched the medical literature for
potentially harmful outcomes associated with these products, such as directly toxic effects and herb-drug interactions. This enabled us to develop a pragmatic approach to
the physician-patient interaction, addressing the risks of
herbal medicine use in the cancer care setting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Background Review of the Literature

An in-depth review focusing on CTM and herbal medicine
use in cancer care among Middle Eastern patients was
performed.29,30 The implications on physician-patient communication were examined as well.31,32Preclinical and clinical
research findings (English language) were searched using 4
databases (PubMed, Micromedex, AltMedDex, and The
Comprehensive Natural Database) published between January 2010 and March 2015.33 A Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH)search using the scientific and commonly used
names of the identified herbal products was conducted, as
was a search using the following terms: “herb-drug interaction,” “adverse effects,” “sideeffects,” “safety,” “risk,”
“toxic/toxicity,” “bioavailability,” “induction,” “absorption,”
“inhibition,” “synergism,” and “chemosensitization.” Boolean operator words (“AND,” “OR”), as well as asterisks (*)
were used in conjunction with the keywords of the search to
ensure that all of the variations of the terms were included.
Study Questionnaire

The study HCPs were asked a series of questions regarding demographic and professional characteristics, and
were then asked to list the 5 leading herbs being used by
their patients. The term “complementary traditional medicine” (CTM) was used to describe those therapies that are
considered to be alternative, natural, folk/traditional,
complementary, or integrative medicine. The study questionnaire was based on a validated questionnaire that was
developed by us in a previous study that explored the perspectives of patients in Israel and Palestine regarding the
integration of CTM within supportive cancer care.34,35
The study questionnaire was reviewed by a focus group of
12 HCPs from a variety of age and sex groups, religious
self-definitions, and cultural backgrounds, as well as other
HCPs working in an oncology setting and with training

in CTM. The English version of the questionnaire was
again reviewed by 16 researchers from 11 Middle-Eastern
countries, all of whom were members of the Middle East
Cancer Consortium (MECC).36 The final version contained 17 questions, with an open-ended question asking
respondents to list the 5 leading herbal compounds being
used by their patients during cancer treatment (see online
Supporting Information).
Distribution of Study Tool

The final version of the study questionnaire was mailed
to a list of HCPs that included oncologists, oncology
surgeons, family physicians, oncology nurses, psychooncologists, and oncology paramedical practitioners. All
participants were Middle-Eastern practitioners treating
patients with cancer on a regular basis who had attended
MECC workshop programs in supportive and palliative
care. Additional HCPs who participated in the workshops
were contacted using a snowball, nonprobability sampling
methodology. Initially, a smaller group was recruited, on
the condition that they were acquainted with at least 20
additional HCPs who met the study inclusion criteria.
Study Sites and Participants

The study was conducted between June 2012 and July
2013, during which time the questionnaire was sent to
HCPs from the following 16 Middle Eastern countries:
Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, Palestinian Authority, Qatar, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia,
600

Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Participating
HCPs were affiliated with 63 cancer care and/or academic
centers in the region.
RESULTS
Of the 422 HCPs contacted from 16 Middle Eastern
countries, 339 returned the study questionnaire (response
rate of 80.3%). Of these, 201 respondents (57.5%) from
15 countries listed at least 1 herbal medicinal product as
being used by their patients. The demographic characteristics of HCPs reporting herbal medicine use were similar
to those whose patients did not use herbal medicines
(Table 1). Herbal medicine use was reported more
frequently among female HCPs (P 5 .005) and among
Muslim respondents compared with their non-Muslim
counterparts (P 5 .0004).
Rates of herbal medicine use and the products identified are shown in Table 2. Countries with high rates of
herbal medicine use included Turkey (as reported by
89.7% of respondents), the Palestinian Authority
(78.1%), Lebanon (69.2%), Qatar (72.7%), and the
United Arab Emirates (62.5%). In total, 47 products were
identified, 44 of them by the scientific nomenclature provided. The remaining 3 products were nutritional supplements (honey, camel’s milk, and Zamzam water from
Mecca in SaudiArabia). The most frequently identified
herbal products included Urtica dioica and urens (stinging
nettle; Turkey), Curcuma longa L. (turmeric; 5 countries),
Allium sativum L. (garlic; 6 countries), Nigella sativa L.

Safety-Related Concerns

A total of 29 of the 44 herbal products identified were associated with safety-related concerns (65.9%) (Table 3).37-93
These were grouped according to 3 predominant themes:
1) potentially harmful herb-drug interactions with a reduction in bioavailability (and thus efficacy) of anticancer
agents, or increased drug levels with increased toxicity
(15 herbs; 34.1%); 2) directly toxic effects of herbal
compounds and metabolites (18 herbs; 40.9%); and 3)
enhanced anticancer effects of conventional treatment
through either synergy with herbal components or chemosensitization of cancer cells, thereby increasing the response
to treatment (7 herbs; 15.9%).
Herb-Drug Interactions

Several potentially negative herb-drug interactions were
identified. These were mediated primarily through the
cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily induction of
CYP3A4.37,38 CYP induction can cause a reduction in bioavailability and subsequently the effectiveness of anticancer agents,39-41 whereas enzyme inhibition can
increase the risk of toxicity, such as that observed with etoposide, paclitaxel, vinblastine, and vincristine.42-47 Additional effects on factors such as intestinal P-glycoprotein,
which inhibits drug absorption, can alter the bioavailabilCancer

ity of anticancer drugs such as etoposide.48-50 The inhibition of boronic acid–based proteasome inhibitors (eg,
bortezomib)51 or the transport of irinotecan and its
metabolite, SN-38, can increase biliary removal with an
increase in the half-life of the drug52; a reduction in organic anion transporting polypeptides can increase the
absorption of chemotherapy agents such as etoposide, irinotecan, methotrexate, and paclitaxel53; gingko biloba can
inhibit paclitaxel metabolism (in vitro)54; and an increase
in the bioavailability or a decrease in the activity of tamoxifen in estrogen-responsive tumors may occur,55-58 as well
as a reduction in the drug’s active metabolite levels via
CYP2D6 inhibition.59,60
Direct Herb-Related Toxicity

Many of the herbal products identified were found to
have directly toxic effects, such as an increased risk of
bleeding with anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment by

anticoagulant activity.95 Herbal products with hepatotoxic effects included Nerium oleander79 and ginseng in
patients treated with imatinib,80 and localized allergic
reactions were found with subcutaneously administered
Viscum album L.81 At the same time, several herbal products were shown to either prevent or reduce the toxicity of
chemotherapy agents, such as Urtica dioica L attenuating
cisplatin-related toxicities.82
Effects on Antitumor Activity

Several of the herbal products identified were found to
induce and augment the cytotoxic activity of conventional
anticancer agents. This results from either a synergistic
interaction with the conventional drug or chemosensitization of the cancer cells. Increased cell death has been
observed with Curcuma longa L. in patients with cisplatinresistant lung cancer cells83; Ganoderma lucidum with
doxorubicin in HeLa cells84 and doxorubicin-resistant
leukemic cell lines85; Linum usitatissimum L. enhancing
the antitumor effects of trastuzumab in breast cancer cell
lines86; Nigella sativa L. with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin
in pancreatic cancer cells87; Panax ginseng metabolites
(Rh2 ginsenosides) with paclitaxel in multidrug-resistant
breast cancer cells88; Silybum marianum L. with
doxorubicin-related apoptosis in the MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line89 as well as with etoposide and doxorubicin
in drug-resistant smallcell lung carcinoma cells90; and
finally, Viscum album L. with paclitaxel in human SKhep1 hepatocarcinoma cells.91 Herbal compounds also
have been found to attenuate the anticancer effects of
chemotherapy (eg, inhibition of etoposide on the MCF-7
breast cancer cells in the presence of curcumin)92 and promote cancer progression (eg, Thymus vulgaris on estrogen
receptor activity).93
DISCUSSION
There are many challenges facing Middle Eastern oncology HCPs treating patients with cancer. These professionals are working in a society in which CTM practices such
as herbal medicine are an integral aspect of the local culture of health care. The research on this subject has been
focused primarily on patient-HCP communication,
which has improved significantly in recent years and
reduced the Rubicon of “to tell or not to tell” that many
patients have faced in the past.94 Today’s oncology HCPs
are expected to provide evidence-based guidance for the
use of herbal products during anticancer treatments.95
In the current study, oncology HCPs were asked
about the herbal products most frequently used by their
patients and about their own perspectives regarding the
606

integration of CTM in supportive cancer care. However,
they were not asked about their role in prescribing the
herbal agents themselves. Earlier research concerning the
role of HCPs in prescribing herbal medicine to their
patients was conducted in an integrative setting in which a
CTM-trained physician consulted patients on this practice.4 In the overwhelming majority of cases, patients were
found to have initiated the use of herbal products on their
own, as part of their CTM treatment. Although the role
of oncology HCPs in advising patients on the use of herbals needs to be studied more in depth, it is our impression
that most herbal medicine use is patient-derived, especially in cases in which there is no professional oncology
consultant available to advise which products should be
used (or avoided).
Communication between patients and oncology
HCPs is a 3-armed triangle, representing the patient, the
oncology HCP, and the integrative physician (IP). IPs are
physicians with training in herbal medicine, and can serve
as an important resource for both patients and their
HCPs, providing up-to-date and evidence-based information regarding the effectiveness and safety of herbal medicine. The IP consultation should be patient-centered,
taking into consideration the many aspects of the patient’s
health belief model and expectations. IPs should be aware
that such a patient-centered consultation, especially in
cross-cultural regions such as the Middle East, needs to
address not only the individual’s perspective. The IP consultation needs to understand the broader sociocultural
and religious context of the patient’s, and the HCP’s,
community, as well as their affinity with traditional medicine. We found a higher rate of reported herbal use among
Muslim respondents, which may suggest that the dialogue
between the HCP, patient, and IP may also relate to communication aspects of care. This may reflect the individualistic and collective cultural perspectives that can often
influence decision-making. IPs should be clinically
focused, helping to reduce the side effects of treatment
and improve quality of life. This will enable patients and
their HCPs to reach an informed decision regarding their
use of herbal products while keeping within the guiding
principle of primum non nocere (first, do no harm).
In the current study, 29 of the 44 herbal products
identified were found to be associated with safety-related
concerns. These included herb-drug interactions, toxic
effects of the herbal components, and alterations in the
response of cancer cells to chemotherapy either through
synergy or increased chemosensitivity.96 Changes to the
CYP, P-glycoprotein, or other metabolic pathways can either reduce the bioavailabilty of drugs (with decreased

efficacy) or, conversely, increase serum levels (with
increased toxicity). With regard to the potential for an
increased response of cancer cells to anticancer treatments,
this may appear to be desirable. However, if proven true,
then adjustments in the dose density of chemotherapy
and other anticancer therapies need to be made. Unnecessarily intense dose-dense therapies inevitably result in an
increased risk of toxicity, which should be avoided if
possible.
The majority of the findings regarding herb-drug
interactions, including those found for the 29 herbal productsidentified herein, are based on either preclinical or
small clinical trials. These include case reports, postmarketing surveillance studies, or reports with indirect findings from explanatory (phases 1-3) clinical research. This
makes it extremely difficult to reach an evidence-based
conclusion on their use in order for patients and their oncology HCPs to make an informed and responsible decision. The “easy” solution for this would indeed be to
make an across-the-board recommendation against the
use of any and all herbal products during active anticancer
treatment. However, such a negative and critical approach
can increase nondisclosure of this practice among patients,
especially in societies in which herbal medicine use is part
of the traditional health-related culture.
A more reasonable and practical approach is to educate oncology HCPs about CTM and herbal medicine
use, providing them with the tools for better communication with their patients. All herbal medicinal products
being used should be recorded in the medical file, and
patients should be referred to a qualified IP for guidance.
The consultation should be part of the conventional oncology service, and patients should be asked specifically
about their use of herbal medicine, as well as about their
expectations from this treatment. The use of herbal products for which there is no evidence of effectiveness, or for
which there are significant safety concerns, should be
discouraged.
In the current study, we addressed several issues that
were related to the safety of herbal medicine use during
chemotherapy. These included the potential for herbdrug interactions, which may compromise efficacy and
increase the toxicity of anticancer treatments. The same is
true for conventional drugs, which are frequently being
used in supportive care and also may interact negatively
with anticancer treatment. An example of this is the interaction between tamoxifen and CYP-2D6 inhibitors such
as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are used
for the treatment of depression and hot flashes.97 The use
of such conventional drugs in conjunction with anticancer
Cancer

February 15, 2016

agents can also lead to reduced efficacy and increased toxicity.98 The potential for drug-drug interactions should be
addressed in clinical practice with the same rigor and thoroughness asis required when investigating herb-drug
interactions.
The current study has several limitations, reflecting
the complex geographic, economic, and political character
of the MiddleEast. This collaborative research program
took place at a time of intense conflict in the region,
requiring the creation of a unique methodological design.
In contrast to most of the research regarding CTM and
herbal agents, which is based almost exclusively on
patient-reported data, we decided to target conventional
oncology HCPs who were working in a conventional cancer treatment setting.99,100 This allowed us to avoid several patient-based biases, such as a reporting bias resulting
from nondisclosure of CTM use to researchers who
patients may have believed had a negative attitude regarding nonconventional medical approaches.101 For this purpose, we asked oncology HCPs to provide a list of herbal
products being used by their patients with cancer, using a
snowball sample approach among participants in an
MECC workshop program.28 This may have led to a
selection bias because the workshop was attended by
HCPs who are oriented to supportive care and thus more
open to the integration of CTM into cancer care. At the
same time, it is likely that some HCPs did not participate
in the study for fear of professional or personal consequences. In addition, the list of herbal medicines identified by the study HCPs was not compared with what
patients may have reported had they been asked.
The absence of a validation process for the questionnaire used in the currentstudy needs to be addressed in
future research. This questionnaire was designed based on
insights gleaned from an HCP focus group, as well as
from a previous validated patient-oriented questionnaire
that had been administered to patients with cancer in
Israel and the Palestinian Authority.34,35 The use of CTM
was based solely on the reports of oncology HCPs and not
on those of their patients. As such, we could not explore
any associations between the prevalence of herbal medicine use and demographic factors such as socioeconomic
conditions or patients’ motives to use herbal medicines
(eg, CTM use as a more affordable treatment option).
Nevertheless, we did not find any correlation between
national rates of herbal medicine use and economic status.
Indeed, a high rate of herbal medicine use was reported
both in wealthy countries such as Qatar and the United
Arab Emirates as well as in less affluent countries such as
the Palestinian Authority and Lebanon.

Future research will need to further explore these
aspects of CTM use in Middle Eastern countries. This
should be done by conducting a regional patient-centered
survey, comparing patients’ perspectives regarding the
integration of CTM in supportive cancer care in varied
oncology settings across the Middle East. This approach
could provide further insight into patients’ perspectives,
which were not explored in the current study, such as the
extent to which patients demand that CTM be part
of their care; whether the use of herbal medicine is CTMbased or influenced by the increased interest in cancerrelated complementary medicine practice in Western
societies; the association between CTM use and costrelated issues; the variations in treatment options based on
the type of cancer; specific issues related to quality of life;
and finally, the incorporation of herbal medicine into the
palliative care setting, in which therapeutic options are often limited. Despite the above limitations, the study
methodology reflects an important and objective
approach for describing a general trend of herbal medicine
use by patients with cancer in Middle Eastern countries.
Future research will need to address these limitations, as
well as assess the impact of integrating IP consultations
within the conventional oncology setting, with the provision of guidance regarding the use of herbal medicine in
supportive cancer care. Such an approach is important to
bridge the physician-patient communication gap, providing patients and their oncology HCPs with important information regardingthe safe and effective use of herbal
medicine.
