ABSTRACT
Grap2 and cyclin D1 interacting protein (GCIP) has been recognized as a putative
tumor suppressor, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its anti-tumor properties
remain undefined. Here, we report that GCIP is frequently downregulated in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues. Binding assays indicated that inhibitor of
DNA binding/differentiation 1 (Id1) interacts with GCIP in the nucleus. Ectopic GCIP
expression in the highly invasive NSCLC cell line, H1299, inhibited proliferation,
colony formation, invasion and migration, and increased susceptibility to anticancer
drugs. Conversely, silencing GCIP expression in the minimally invasive NSCLS cell
line, A549, increased proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and migration in vitro,
and increased survival and resistance to anticancer drugs. GCIP also suppresses
tumorigenicity of NSCLC cells in vivo and GCIP suppresses NSCLC progression is
mediated in part by interfering with Id1 signaling, which was confirmed in conditionally
induced stable cell lines. In addition, GCIP downregulates the expression of Id1,
and GCIP and Id1 are inversely expressed in NSCLC cell lines and specimens. Taken
together, these results suggest that GCIP is a potential tumor suppressor in NSCLC
and that suppression of Id1-mediated oncogenic properties may be a key mechanism
by which GCIP can potently suppress NSCLC tumor progression.

INTRODUCTION

for DNA binding [6]. Among four types of Id proteins
(Id1, Id2, Id3, and Id4), Id1 has been extensively studied
in various cancers and is linked to tumorigenesis, as
aberrant elevation of Id1 has been found in over 20 types
of human cancer [7]. Moreover, high Id1 expression levels
are correlated with aggressive and high-grade cancer, as
well as poor clinical outcome in different tumor types [813]. In addition, among the identified genes that mediated
breast cancer metastasis to the lungs, Id1 was identified
as one of the most active [14]. Furthermore, Id1 is a
novel prognostic factor in NSCLC patients [15] and is a
common mediator of NSCLC progression and metastasis
in both smokers and nonsmokers [16].
GCIP is a 40-kDa HLH leucine zipper protein,
which is also recognized as a dnHLH protein [17] and

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death
worldwide. More than 80% cases are classified as nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is characterized
by its poor prognosis and resistance to antineoplastic drugs
both in vitro and in vivo [1, 2]. Patients with NSCLC have
a 5-year survival rate of less than 15% [3]. To improve
the survival of patients with NSCLC, it is important to
elucidate the signaling pathways regulating both NSCLC
tumor promotion and suppression to identify novel
prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets[4, 5].
The inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation (Id)
proteins belong to the dominant-negative helix-loop-helix
(dnHLH) family of proteins, which lack a basic domain

was originally identified to be a human Grap2 and cyclin
D-interacting protein [18] and also was recognized as
a human homologue of the MAID protein (HHM) [19]
and a D-type cyclin-interacting protein 1 (DIP1) [20].
Although several proteins, such as nuclear p29, Rad
associated with diabetes (Rad), ribosomal phosphoprotein
(P0), and oligodendrocyte transcription factor 1 (Olig 1),
interact with GCIP [21-25], its physiological function
remains largely undefined. Previous studies indicated that
GCIP is expressed mainly in terminally differentiated
tissues and might play an important role in controlling
cell differentiation and proliferation [26]. In addition,
overexpression of GCIP in mouse liver suppressed
diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver tumors in
transgenic mice [27], and mice lacking GCIP (Maid)
expression in the liver are prone to earlier development
of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and hepatocellular
adenomas (HCAs) [28]. In addition, expression of
GCIP was reduced in several cancer tissues with tumor
progression and metastasis, including breast, prostate
and colon tumor tissues [22]. Furthermore, decreased
expression of GCIP correlates with poor patient prognosis
in breast cancer [29].
Although GCIP is considered a putative tumor

suppressor in breast, colon and liver cancers, its role in
NSCLC tumor progression remains unknown. In this
report, we evaluated the expression of GCIP in NSCLC
and explored its role in NSCLC progression. Our
results revealed that GCIP expression was significantly
downregulated in NSCLC tissues, and the antitumor
activity of GCIP was mechanistically mediated by the
ability of GCIP not only to interact with Id1 but also to
suppress its transcriptional activity, and thereby, increasing
the susceptibility to chemotherapeutic agents.

RESULTS
GCIP expression is significantly downregulated in
invasive NSCLC tissues
To investigate the role of GCIP in NSCLC
progression, we first assessed its expression in NSCLC
gene expression data sets. The Oncomine database
revealed that GCIP is significantly downregulated in 58
primary NSCLC tissues, compared with adjacent normal
tissues (Fig. 1A, P<0.0001). We then investigated GCIP

tumors. C, prognostic role of GCIP protein levels in NSCLC (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) specimens were examined by

expression levels in 72 NSCLC specimens (comprised
68.1% adenocarcinoma and 31.9% squamous cell
carcinoma) by Immunohistochemistry. The result
revealed significant downregulation of GCIP in both the
adenocarcinoma and the squamous cell carcinoma (Fig.
1B). In addition, GCIP expression levels were lower in
stage IV tumors as compared to stage I tumor (Fig. 1C).
These results suggest that GCIP plays a negative role in
tumor progression and may be a valuable biomarker for
NSCLC.

Flag antibody. Analysis of 293T cell fractions revealed
the c-Myc-GCIP Flag-Id1 complex was present mainly
in the nucleus (Fig. 2B). In addition, immunofluorescence
analysis indicated that GCIP and Id1 were co-localized
in the nucleus of H1299 cells (Fig. S1). Furthermore,
the interaction between the endogenous proteins was
confirmed in A549 cells (Fig. 2C). Because Id1 expression
could be induced by bone morphogenetic protein 2
(BMP2) [31], a markedly enhanced level of endogenous
Id1 was coimmunoprecipitated in A549 cells stimulated
with BMP2 for 24 h (Fig. 2C), further supporting the
physical interaction between GCIP and Id1. To examine
whether other Id proteins similarly interact with GCIP,
four pBIND vectors containing full-length Id1, Id2, Id3,
and Id4 cDNAs were constructed. Mammalian twohybrid assays indicated that Id1 exhibited the strongest
interaction with GCIP followed by Id3; its interaction with
Id2 and Id4 was relatively weaker (Supplementary Fig.
S2A). Similar results were obtained with GST pull-down
assays (Fig. 2D). Using truncated protein constructions,
mammalian two-hybrid assays revealed that GCIP requires
its HLH domain to associate with Id1 (Supplementary Fig.
S2B). Taken together, these results indicated that GCIP

Identification of Id1 as a GCIP-interacting protein
To gain more insight into GCIP function, we
isolated proteins that interact with it using full-length
GCIP as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid system. Among the
positive clones screened from a human cDNA library, two
positive clones had high sequence similarity with Id1. To
examine whether GCIP interacts with Id1 in mammalian
cells, 293T cells were cotransfected with c-Myc-GCIP and
Flag-Id1 expression vectors. As shown in Fig. 2A, FlagId1 was specifically coimmunoprecipitated using an antiMyc antibody followed by Immunoblotting with an anti-

association with Id1.

controls (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Consistent with a previous study [20], both
H1299/GCIP-6 and -9 cells exhibited a decrease in cell
proliferation (Fig. 3B, right). In contrast, both A549/
shGCIP-3 and -4 cells showed a significant increase in
cell proliferation, when compared with respective controls
(Fig. 3B, left). These results were further confirmed by
colony formation assays (Fig. 3C). We also generated
stable A549 cells that overexpress Id1 (A549/Id1) and
stable H1299 cells that express shId1 (H1299/shId1)
(Supplementary Fig. S3C and D). In accordance with a
previous study by Yu-Jen Cheng et al. [32], A549/Id1 cells
exhibited significantly increased cell proliferation, whereas
H1299/shId1 cells displayed significantly decreased cell
proliferation, when compared with respective controls
(Supplementary Fig. 4A and B).

GCIP inhibited and Id1 increased NSCLC
proliferation in vitro
In the less-invasive NSCLS cell lines, CL1-0 and
A549. Western blot analysis indicated that relatively
high levels of GCIP expression and relatively low levels
of Id1expression were detected (Fig. 3A). In contrast,
low levels of GCIP expression and high levels of Id1
expression were detected in the highly invasive NSCLC
cell lines, CL1-5 and H1299 (Fig. 3A). To explore the
functional significance of GCIP-Id1 interaction, two
stable H1299 cells with ectopic expression of GCIP
(H1299/GCIP clone 6, 9) and two A549 cells stably
expressing GCIP shRNA (A549/shGCIP clone 3, 4) were
next generated. Western blot analysis confirmed the high
expression of GCIP in H1299/GCIP-9 and H1299/GCIP6 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A) and reduced GCIP
expression level in A549/shGCIP-3 cells as compared to

profoundly increased migration and invasion, when
compared with respective controls (Fig. 4A and B).
Whereas knockdown of Id1 diminished cell migration and
invasion, its overexpression led to enhanced migration
and invasion by H1299/shId1 cells and A549/Id1cells,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5A and B). Consistent
with the in vitro experiments, A549/shGCIP-4 cells had
significantly greater tumor growth, whereas H1299/
GCIP-9 cells exhibited reduced tumor growth in NOC/
SCID mice (Fig. 4C). Specifically, the average tumor
volume in mice bearing A549/shGCIP-4 cells was
increased by 50%, whereas mice bearing H1299/GCIP9 cells had tumor volumes that were decreased by 24%,
when compared to respective controls (Fig. 4C). Notably,
immunohistochemical staining revealed that the H1299
GCIP-expressing tumors had significantly decreased Ki67staining relative to control tumors (Fig. 4D). Collectively,
our data indicate that GCIP expression suppresses
tumorigenicity of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo.

GCIP suppresses NSCLC
interfering with Id1 signaling

progression

(e.g., snail, slug, vimentin and fibronectin), and MMP9
expression levels in H1299/shId1 cells; a significant
increase in p-PI3K (Tyr467), p-Akt (Ser473), NFκB/
p65, snail, slug, vimentin, fibronectin, and MMP9
expression levels in the A549/Id1 cells was also observed
(Supplementary Fig. S6A and B). Furthermore, whereas
both H1299/GCIP-6 and -9 cells had significantly
decreased p-PI3K (Tyr467), p-Akt (Ser473), NFκB/p65,
snail, slug, vimentin, fibronectin, and MMP9 expression
levels, both A549/shGCIP-3 and -4 cells displayed
significantly increased p-PI3K (Tyr467), p-Akt (Ser473),
NFκB/p65, snail, slug, vimentin, fibronectin, and MMP9
expression levels, when compared with their respective
controls (Fig. 5A and B).
To determine if GCIP suppression of NSCLC
progression may be mediated by inhibiting the
Id1 signaling pathway, a stable Tet-On system for
doxycycline-dependent expression of GCIP was
established in A549/Id1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6C).
Expression of p-PI3K (Tyr467), p-Akt (Ser473), NFκB/
p65, snail, slug, vimentin, and MMP9, which was elevated
by overexpressing Id1 in A549/Id1/Tet-on-GCIP cells
(clone -1 and -2), was profoundly decreased when GCIP
was expressed (Fig. 5C and D). Taken together, these
data reveal that GCIP suppresses NSCLC progression is,
at least in part, mediated by inhibiting Id1 downstream
signaling.

Previous studies demonstrated that Id1 expression
was associated with activation of the Akt-related pathway
and correlated with elevated expression of mesenchymal
markers in NSCLC cells [16, 32]. Consistent with
these studies, we observed a considerable reduction of

(Ser473), NFκB/p65, the EMT inducers or markers

GCIP and Id1 are inversely expressed in NSCLC
cell lines and tissues

with malignancy. Furthermore, Id1 expression analysis
was also conducted using the same samples employed
for GCIP IHC analysis in Fig. 1B. Low levels of GCIP
expression significantly correlated with high levels of Id1
expression in the metastatic tumors (Fig. 6C). This inverse
expression pattern between GCIP and Id1 was observed in
the NSCLC tissues from 72 human patients; there was a
statistically significant inverse correlation between GCIP
and Id1 expression (r=-0.2834, p< 0.05). A previous study
reported that higher Id1 levels were associated with an
overall survival in adenocarcinoma but not in squamous
cell carcinoma from 346 NSCLC patients[15], however
survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier plotter database
(www.kmplot.com, 2014 version) with a log-rank test
revealed that increased Id1 expression correlated with
poor prognosis in both the adenocarcinoma and squamous
cell carcinoma from 1405 NSCLC patients (Fig. 6D and
Supplementary Fig. S7C). Nevertheless no information
of GCIP expression can be seen in this database. Taken
together, GCIP inhibits the expression of Id1, and GCIP
and Id1 are inversely expressed in NSCLC cell lines
and tissue specimens, suggesting that GCIP suppresses
NSCLC progression by downregulating the expression
and function of Id1.

Although Id1 overexpression and silencing did
not alter GCIP expression in A549/Id1 and H1299/shId1
cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S7A), we observed
a marked decrease in Id1 expression in the GCIPoverexpressing (H1299/GCIP-9) cells and a significant
increase in Id1 expression in the GCIP-silenced (A549/
shGCIP-3 and -4) cells (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Cotransfection of an Id1 promoter reporter construct (from
-1 to -2134) [13] with a GCIP expression plasmid, a
GCIP-shRNA plasmid, or control vector, revealed that
ectopic expression of GCIP led to markedly decreased
Id1 promoter reporter activity; expression of shGCIP led
to upregulated Id1 promoter reporter activity (Fig. 6A).
Thus, GCIP expression downregulates Id1 expression by
inhibiting its transcription, and silencing GCIP upregulates
Id1 expression in NSCLC cell lines.
The inverse correlation between GCIP and Id1
expression was also observed in NSCLC specimens. As
shown in Fig. 6B, Id1 was weakly expressed in early-stage
NSCLC specimens; however, its expression increased

Effects of GCIP on sensitivity of NSCLC cells to
chemotherapy

(p<0.05; Fig. 6E). Similar results were also obtained
from these cells treated with docetaxel, which has
been approved as a first- and second-line treatment for
advanced NSCLC (Supplementary Fig. S7D and E). Thus,
depletion of GCIP promoted resistance, while expression
of GCIP potentiated the cytotoxic effect of anticancer
drugs, suggesting that GCIP expression increased
susceptibility to chemotherapeutic agents by inhibiting
Id1-induced chemoresistance. Furthermore, depletion of
GCIP, which was observed in most NSCLC specimens
especially in patients with invasive NSCLC, might reduce
chemosensitivity in NSCLC patients.

Because increased Id1 expression was correlated
with chemoresistance of NSCLC cells [15], we examined
whether overexpression of GCIP could reverse this
chemoresistance. GCIP-overexpressing H1299 cells
(H1299/GCIP-9), GCIP-silenced A549 cells (A549/
shGCIP-4), or their respective control cells were treated
with 0, 25 and 200 μg/mL carboplatin for 72 h. As
expected, H1299/GCIP-9 cells treated with 200 μg/
mL carboplatin exhibited a significant reduction in cell
growth compared to the H1299 cells treated with the
same dose (p<0.05; Figure 6F). On the contrary, A549/
shGCIP-4 cells exhibited a significantly increased the cell
viability when treated with 25 or 200 μg/ml carboplatin
compared to the A549 cells treated with the same dose

DISCUSSION
Growing evidence indicates that the GCIP is a novel
tumor suppressor in breast, colon and liver cancers [22,

27-29]. However, the precise mechanisms underlying
its anti-tumor properties have not been fully elucidated.
It is generally thought that GCIP may inhibit the protein
expression and function of cyclin D1, and thereby,
inhibiting cell proliferation and tumorigenesis [18, 20, 2224, 27, 28]. Consistent with these previous studies, in this
study, we also found that both cyclin D1 expression and
phosphorylation of Rb at Ser780 (RbS780) were enhanced
in GCIP-silenced A549 cells; both cyclin D1 and RbS780
were decreased in GCIP-overexpressing H1299 cells (data
not shown). Furthermore, our data presented here also
demonstrated that GCIP interacts with and represses Id in
NSCLC cell lines. Since cyclin D1 has been implication
in several cell types as a target of Id1 [33, 34] and is a
key modulator proliferation, it is reasonable to speculate
that attenuation of GCIP would lead to upregulation of
Id1, which may also contribute to enhanced cyclin D1
and RbS780 levels, subsequently leading to the increased
proliferation.
In addition to inducing cell proliferation, Id1 may
also induce EMT, inhibit apoptosis and promote migration,
invasion, metastasis and drug resistance in several types
of cancer [35, 36]. It is an upstream regulator of the
PI3K/Akt/NFκB pathway in esophageal, head and neck,
ovarian, gastric and lung cancer cells [32, 37, 38], and
the expression of vimentin and fibronectin is regulated by
Id1 at transcriptional level in NSCLC [16]. In addition,
Id1 induces snail1expression in kidney epithelial cells
[39] and positively regulates MMP-9 expression in breast
and lung cancer cell lines [40, 41]. Consistent with these
previous studies, Id1-induced expression and/or activation
of the aforementioned proteins was inhibited in GCIPoverexpressing H1299 cells, and was enhanced in GCIPsilenced A549 cells. Furthermore, GCIP downregulated
these proteins through inhibition of Id1, which was
confirmed in a conditionally induced stable A549 cell line.
Significantly higher Id1 protein expression was previously
found in 346, 61[15, 41] and 1405 NSCLC specimens
(www.kmplot.com, 2014 version), respectively, and 72
NSCLC specimens in this study. As compared to Id3,
more frequent expression of Id1 was observed in NSCLC
specimens [42]. Furthermore, among the Id proteins, GCIP
exhibited the strongest interaction with Id1, inhibiting its
expression. Given the role of the PI3K/Akt/NFκB pathway
in apoptosis resistance [38, 43], chemoresistance [44, 45]
as well as the regulation of cellular invasion and metastasis
[46, 47] as well as the importance of both snail and Slug
as critical regulators of EMT, which is important for
tumor invasion and metastasis, and resistance to several
antitumor-drugs [48, 49] combined with the role of MMP9
as an important mediator of malignant invasiveness and
metastasis [40], it is tempting to speculate that GCIPmediated downregulation of Id1 and its downstream
effectors could be a key mechanism by which GCIP can
potently suppress NSCLC tumor progression.
Id1 is recognized as an inhibitor of differentiation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and essential for embryonic development [6]. Consistent
with dedifferentiation of adult tissues being intricately
connected to oncogenesis, the evidence for an important
role of Id1 in cancer development and progression seems
to be growing [35]. Alternatively, although GCIP is also
recognized as a dnHLH protein and structurally related to
the mouse Id1-like molecule, Maid, it is widely expressed
in differentiated cells in adults and has been demonstrated
to be a tumor suppressor in breast, colon and liver cancers
in contrast to the extremely low expression of Id1 in
adult tissues. Induction of Id1 expression in response
to extracellular signaling molecules, including bone
morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), has also been reported
[31, 50, 51]. In addition, previous studies have also
demonstrated that Id1 is required to maintain self-renewal
capacity in various stem cells [13, 52], and is required for
tumor initiating function, both in the context of primary
tumor formation and during metastatic colonization
of the lung microenvironment [53]. In this study, we
demonstrated that GCIP transcriptionally inhibited Id1
expression and exerted antagonistic effects on Id1-driven
tumor progression of NSCLC. On the basis of these
findings, and the fact that GCIP is expressed mainly in
terminally differentiated tissues in adults where Id1 levels
are extremely low, we propose that GCIP expression in
both the non-transformed lung cells and the differentiated
NSCLC cells serves to restrict the levels of Id1. However,
in the presence of extracellular signaling molecules that
can induce Id1 but not GCIP expression in NSCLC cell
lines (e.g., BMP2, Fig. 1C), upregulation of Id1 may
overcome the tumor suppressive functions of GCIP. In
addition, loss of GCIP through currently unidentified
mechanisms during tumor development could also
contribute to enhanced Id1 levels, consequently promoting
tumor progression of NSCLC. The regulation of GCIP and
the mechanisms that GCIP transcriptionally regulates Id1
are currently being studied.
Our present study also showed that GCIP expression
level negatively correlated with NSCLC disease stage, and
that GCIP and Id1 are inversely expressed in NSCLC cell
lines and tissues. In addition, we also demonstrated that
GCIP downregulated Id1 to render NSCLC cells more
susceptibility to carboplatin and docetaxel, two commonly
used anticancer drugs for NSCLC. Thus, GCIP may also
be a useful prognostic marker for NSCLC in addition to
Id1. Furthermore, our data also imply that robust induction
of GCIP may not only improve chemosensitivity but also
be an effective therapeutic approach in NSCLC.
In summary, GCIP is a tumor suppressor that
interacts with Id1 in NSCLC. Upregulation of GCIP
suppresses Id1-mediated downstream signaling. Clinical
and mechanistic evidence supports that GCIP exerts
its tumor-suppressive function in NSCLC through
suppression of Id1-triggered oncogenic properties.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Supplementary Data.

Cell lines

Proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic
assays

293T cells and the lung cancer cell lines, A549,
H1299, CL1-0 and CL1-5, were cultured in complete
medium consisting of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). All cells were incubated in 10-cm tissue culture
dishs (BD Falcon, San Jose, CA, USA) at 37°C and 5%
CO2, and were subcultured every 3–4 days. P.C. Yang
kindly provided the lung cancer cell lines, CL1-0 and
CL1-5. The lung cancer cell lines, A549 and H1299, were
purchased from Bioresource Collection and Research
Center (BCRC), Hsinchu, Taiwan.

Cell proliferation was measured by trypan-blue
staining. Briefly, cells were plated at a concentration
of 1 × 105 cells in 10-cm dishes. Every 24 h, cells were
trypsinized and counted. To evaluate migration or invasion,
1–5 × 104 cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM in an
upper compartment of a transwell (BD Biosciences) or
with a matrigel-coated transwell (BD Biosciences) using
24-well plates for 24 to 72 h. The wiped membrane was
fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. The percentages
of migrating cells were calculated in three independent
representative fields. Colony formation assays were
conducted by plating 500 cells/well into 100-mm culture
dishes in triplicate. After a 12-day incubation at 37°C and
5% CO2, cells were fixed with formaldehyde and stained
with 2% crystal violet. The number of colonies was then
counted, and the surviving fraction of treated cells was
normalized to the surviving fraction of the corresponding
controls.

Immunoprecipitation
Cells that were transfected with plasmids as
described in Supplementary Methods were washed with
cold PBS and lysed in NP-40 buffer (NaCl, 150 mM, NP40, 1.0%, Tris-Cl 50 mM, pH 8.0). A detailed procedure
for the immunoprecipitation assay was described in the
Supplementary Data.

Xenograft
To examine the effect of GCIP expression in tumor
formation, 1 × 106 H1299/mock, H1299/G6, A549/shLuc
or A549/shG3 cells were implanted subcutaneously
into 5-week-old female BALB/c nude mice (n=5), and
the tumor growth was monitored using calipers every 3
to 4 days. Animals were sacrificed 30 or 35 days after
inoculation, and tumors were isolated and fixed in 10%
natural-buffer formalin (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ,
USA) for further immunohistochemical staining was
performed as previously described [29].

GST pull-down assay
BL-21 bacteria were transformed with pGEX-5X-3
(GST alone) or each GST fusion construct a described in
Supplementary Methods. A detailed procedure for the GST
pull-down assay was described in the Supplementary Data.

Id1 promoter assays

Expression dataset from microarray analysis

Luciferase and galactosidase assay systems
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) were used for promoter
analysis. A detailed procedure for the Id1 promoter
analysis with GCIP was described in the Supplementary
Data.

Patient
clinical
immunohistochemistry

specimens

The Oncomine databases were queried to identify
the prognostic role of GCIP components in NSCLC. The
Oncomine Cancer Microarray database from Hou et al.
[30] was employed to compare GCIP gene expression in
normal lung and primary in NSCLC tumor.

and

Cell viability analysis by MTT assay
NSCLC tissue samples were collected from 72
consecutive patients, who underwent resection at the
National Cheng Kung University Hospital. All patients
gave informed consent for retention and analysis of their
tissue for research. Unstained slides were deparaffinized
in xylene and rehydrated sequentially in ethanol.
Immunohistochemistry analysis of GCIP was performed
as previously described[29] and Id1 was described in the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

A549/shLuc, A549/shG3, H1299/mock and H1299/
G6 cells were plated in 96-well plates (2 ×106 cells/mL)
in triplicate. Cells were treated with 0, 25, and 200 μg/
mL carboplatin or 0, 25 μg/mL docetaxel. After 3 days,
cell proliferation was measured using MTT (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) assays according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm.

Staining intensities (1 = +, 2 = ++ and 3 = +++),
fraction of positive cells (0=0%, 1=<5%, 2=5–50% and
3=>50% of tumor cells) and the histological grade (G1
= well, G2 = moderate and G3 = poor) were scored by
an experienced pathologist (MG), who was blinded
to the patient’s clinical details. The semi-quantitative
H-score, defined as the staining intensity × fraction of
positive cells (range, 0–9), was determined and used for
statistical analysis. Pearson rank correlation (r) was used
to assess correlation between GCIP and Id1 genes. Unless
otherwise specified, all experiments were performed in
triplicate and were repeated at least twice. Data were
expressed as mean values ±SE or SD and were analyzed
using GraphPad Prism software. The level of significance
was set at P < 0.05.
