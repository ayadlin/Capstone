Abstract
The p53 protein is a sequence-specific DNA-binding factor
that can induce apoptosis or activate genes whose dysregulation is involved in cancer. By using serial analysis of gene
expression technique, p53-induced genes (PIGs) have been
identified, one of which was lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–
induced tumor necrosis factor-A (TNF-A) factor (LITAF/
PIG7). LITAF regulates the transcription of cytokines such as
TNF-A. To further elucidate the role of p53 in LITAF
expression, LITAF promoter activity was carefully dissected.
In this study, we found that the element required for
transcriptional activity is mainly located in the region from
990 to 500 of the LITAF promoter; the specific site required
for p53 protein-DNA binding is located between 550 and
500. We also found that transient transfection of either a p53
short DNA sequence, called p53LFB12, or its corresponding
7-amino-acid synthetic peptide from amino acids 164 to 170
(K164Q165S166Q167H168M169T170), named p53pep164, significantly reduced LITAF promoter activity to 15% in p53-null
H1299 cells. Transfection of p53pep164 into H1299 cells
significantly down-regulated LPS-induced LITAF expression
as well. Furthermore, transfection of p53pep164 into human
monocytes resulted in down-regulation of nine proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-A. We also found that the
LPS-activated p53 is a short-lived protein, and that p53orchestrated apoptosis occurs shortly after the initiation stage
following LPS stimulation and lasts a short time. Once p53
levels return to baseline, the p53-mediated inhibition of LITAF
is released, and LITAF-mediated cytokine production can
proceed. The present finding proposes a novel link between
p53 and the inflammatory processes and highlights potential
interventional approaches to control p53-associated inflammatory processes. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1308–16]

Introduction
The tumor suppressor p53 is known to function as a sequencespecific DNA-binding factor that can activate genes whose
promoters contain a p53 response element (1–4). This p53 protein
helps to maintain the genomic stability of cells, thereby reducing
the probability that a cancer will develop. Lost or mutated p53 is
frequently associated with a broad spectrum of human cancers
(5, 6). By using the serial analysis of gene expression technique to
evaluate the patterns of gene expression following p53 expression,
a series of p53-induced genes (PIGs), including lipopolysaccharide

(LPS)–induced tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) factor (LITAF/
PIG7), have been identified and implicated as targets of p53
transcriptional activation (7). Indeed, p53 was found to suppress
nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)–mediated inflammatory responses (8).
Because our recently cloned transcription factor LITAF, which
exhibits NF-nB–like activities, such as regulating the transcription
of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a), was later identified as PIG7, we
were interested in investigating how p53 might control LITAF gene
expression, thereby also contributing to the regulation of cytokines,
including TNF-a.
We previously identified LITAF, which we have shown performs
a similar function as NF-nB to regulate TNF-a transcription (9).
Inhibition of LITAF mRNA expression in THP-1 cells results in a
reduction of TNF-a transcripts. We found that high levels of LITAF
mRNA are expressed predominantly in placenta, peripheral blood
leukocytes, lymph nodes, and spleen. We also identified the DNA
site within the TNF-a promoter that is essential for LITAF binding
(10). More recently, we reported the discovery and characterization
of a cofactor in this cytokine-regulatory process (signal transducer
and activator of transcription 6B), which is LPS dependent as well
and which binds to LITAF and up-regulates the transcription of
cytokines (11).
The aim of the present study was to characterize the binding
relationship between p53 protein and the LITAF DNA promoter
and to further dissect the role of p53 in LITAF-mediated processes
following LPS stimulation.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. All bacterial cloning constructs used Escherichia coli strain
DH5a (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). U2OS human osteosarcoma cells [p53
wild type (wt)] were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
THP-1 cells [TIB-202, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA
(ATCC)] were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Human
H1299, a p53-null non–small cell lung cancer cell line (CRL-5803, ATCC),
which contains a homozygous deletion of the p53 gene, was maintained in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine and adjusted to
contain 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/L glucose,
1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, and 10% FBS. Human monocytes, purchased
from AB, Inc. (Columbia, MD), were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% FBS. All human cell cultures were maintained in a 37jC
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
Plasmid constructs. (I) The clone p53-1, which contains a full-length
human p53 gene and expresses wt p53 protein in mammalian cells, was
kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center,
Baltimore, MD). A series of human p53 deletions were constructed, and the
major clones were named A12, B1, C6, D10, or p53LFB12, as follows. (a) A12
contained the amino acids of p53 (1-393D101-169). The first mutant DNA
fragment was generated by PCR with the primer pair 5¶-ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGAT-3¶ and 5¶-CCGTCATGTGCTGGGAAGGGACAGAAGATG-3¶.
The second DNA fragment was generated by PCR with the primer pair
5¶-CACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAG-3¶ and 5¶-TCAGTCTGAGTCAGGCCCT-3¶.
Both the first and second PCR-generated DNA fragments were purified and
diluted as template to 1 ng per reaction and amplified by PCR with the

Finally, the p53 site mutant DNA fragment was inserted into the pcDNA3.1/
V5-His TOPO vector. (c) C6 contained coordinating amino acids of p53

with the primer pair 5¶-ATGAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGA-3¶ and
5¶-CGTCATGTGCTGTGACTGCTTCATA-3¶ was annealed by heating for
2 min at 65jC and then cooling slowly to <35jC over 15 to 30 min. The
annealed DNA fragment was inserted into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO

<35jC over 15 to 30 min. The annealed DNA fragment was directly inserted
into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector. (II) Human genomic DNA from
THP-1 cells was prepared as described (12). Subsequently, the full-length

CCCCGCC-3¶ and 5¶-CCCCAGCCAAGGGCTCAGTGC-3¶ for the region 600
to 400 of LITAF promoter. The primer pair 5¶-GCCCCCGCCCCCGTCCCCGCC-3¶ and 5¶-CTGGCGCCACCGGCCCCCCGC-3¶ was used for 600
to 440, and the primer pair 5¶-GCGCCCGAGAGGCCAGCTCAGA-3¶ and
5¶-CCCCAGCCAAGGGCTCAGTGC-3¶ was used for 560 to 400. DNA
containing deletions was generated as follows. The double-stranded
oligonucleotide (ds-oligo) was annealed by heating for 2 min at 65jC and
then cooled slowly to <35jC over 15 to 30 min with the follow primer pairs:
(a) 5¶-GCCCCCGCCCCCGTCCCCGCCGCCCGGCCCTTTTCTCGGGGCGCCCGAGAGGCCAGCTCAGACCTCCCGGCTCGACAGGCGGCGCGGGCGGCGGTGAGTG-3¶ and 5¶-CCCCAGCCAAGGGCTCAGTGCCCGGGGCCCCCAGCAGGTCCCCGGCGTCCCCGCGCCGCACTCACCGCCGCCCGCGCC-3¶

After
annealing, each 0.01 Ag annealed ds-oligo was amplified without additional
primers or template by PCR. Finally, the DNAs were purified using a gel
extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and each DNA species was labeled
with [g32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Labeled double-stranded DNA oligos were
purified using G-25 Sephadex columns (Boehringer, Ingelheim, Germany)
and precipitated with ethanol. After centrifugation, the DNA pellets were
suspended in 10 AL water, and aliquots of each oligonucleotide were
measured for cpm/AL and used as probes for electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA), as described below.
IP-p53 or IP-actin. Cultures of U2OS cells (5  106) were transfected
with p53-1 or pcDNA3 as control using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) for
3 h, washed with PBS, and incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS
at 37jC and 5% CO2. The proteins from the treated cells or untreated
control cells were extracted with lysis buffer (Promega) plus a cocktail of
protein inhibitors (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The immunoprecipitation of p53 (IP-p53) or actin (IP-actin) as
control was done using a goat IgG (sc-2028, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA), a Protein A/G Plus-Agarose (sc-2003, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), or an antibody to p53 (sc-6243-G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or actin (sc-1615, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The protein levels of IP-p53 and IP-actin were
confirmed by Western blot with their corresponding antibodies.
Bio-Plex cytokine assay. Human monocytes (1  106) were stimulated
with 0.1 Ag/mL E. coli LPS for 3 h, washed with PBS, then further
transfected with p53-1 or pcDNA3 as control using LipofectAMINE 2000
(Invitrogen) or treated with peptides by a Chariot kit (Active Motif,
Carlsbad, CA). Cells were then incubated overnight in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% FBS at 37jC and 5% CO2. Culture supernatants
were harvested and centrifuged at 1,500  g to remove cell debris, then
concentrations of cytokines, including human TNF-a, in the supernatant of
each treated or untreated control cell condition were measured. The
immunoreactivity was quantified by Bio-Plex 200 System (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) and then graphed.
Peptides. Synthetic peptides were supplied by Biosynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). p53pep164 consisted of the p53 sequence KQSQHMT located in
the region from amino acids 164 to 170; pepSC served as a negative control
peptide and consisted of the randomly scrambled sequence SKMQQTH
(Medusa Random Sample Generator Software, Randombots.com). Both
peptides were solubilized in DMSO and delivered into p53-null H1299 or
human monocytes by Chariot kit (Active Motif). They were detected by
reporter assays and Western blots following the manufacturer’s instructions.
EMSA. A commercial kit, Gel Shift Assay System (Promega), was used. A
reaction mixture contained 2 AL of HeLa nuclear extract, 1  105 cpm/AL
radiolabeled double-stranded oligo DNA probe, 1 Ag of IP-p53 protein

achieve a final volume of 10 AL. Mixtures were incubated at room
temperature for 20 min, followed by electrophoresis on nondenaturing 6%
polyacrylamide gels in Tris-borate-EDTA buffer [90 mmol/L Tris-borate/2
mmol/L EDTA HEPES (pH 8)].
Western blot analysis. Cultures of p53 wt U2OS cells (5  106), p53null human H1299 non–small cell lung cancer cells (5  106), or p53 wt
human monocytes (1  106) were transfected with DNAs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) for 3 h; washed with PBS; and further transfected
with synthetic p53 peptides using a Chariot kit (Active Motif) as required.
Cells were then incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS at 37jC
in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The proteins from the
treated cells or untreated controls were extracted with lysis buffer
(Promega) plus a cocktail of protein inhibitors (Sigma) following the
manufacturer’s instructions and suspended in SDS sample buffer, heated at
95jC for 5 min, then applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected by
Western blotting. Antibodies were purchased from the following vendors:

LITAF (611615, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), actin (C-11, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), p53 (FL-393-G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or luciferase (NB
600-307, Novus Bio, Inc., Littleton, CO).
Luciferase assay. Cultures of U2OS (5  106), p53-null human H1299
non–small cell lung cancer cells (5  106), or p53 wt human monocytes
(1  106) were cotransfected with DNAs using LipofectAMINE 2000
(Invitrogen) for 3 h; washed with PBS; then further treated with peptides by
Chariot kit (Active Motif) as required. The b-galactosidase gene was
included in all transfections. Cells were then incubated overnight in
appropriate media (DMEM or RPMI 1640) + 10% FBS at 37jC, in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were harvested, and the
luciferase activity of each lysate was measured (Turner Designs luminometer model TD-20/20) using a commercial kit (luciferase reporter assay
system, Promega) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer.
Finally, the data were normalized to h-galactosidase expression.

Human monocytes (1  104 per well) cultured in 96-well plates were
transiently transfected with DNA (p53-1 or pcDNA3 as control) using
LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), or else, the cells were stimulated with 0.1
Ag/mL E. coli LPS. Treated cells were then incubated in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% FBS at 37jC and 5% CO2. Cell supernatants were
discarded, and cells were fixed at various times (0, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16 h)
with 200 AL of fixative solution (80% methanol in PBS) and incubated at
37jC for 30 min. Triplicate samples of fixed cells from each condition were
subjected to the ssDNA Apoptosis ELISA following the manufacturer’s
protocol (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA). Finally, the p53induced apoptotic rate in cells was quantified on a model 680 Microplate
Reader (Bio-Rad) and then graphed. To confirm the effects of p53 and other
related gene expression on apoptosis, the cell lysates from human
monocytes (1  106 per well) cultured in six-well plates under the same
conditions were also assayed. The protein levels of these cells were detected
by Western blot with antibodies against p53, LITAF, p21, caspase-3, or actin
as control.

Results
Apoptosis assay. To investigate the effect of LPS-induced p53
on apoptosis in cells, human monocytes were transfected with p531 or pcDNA3 as control or stimulated with LPS, then collected at
various times and assessed by ssDNA apoptosis ELISA. As shown in
Fig. 1A, the relative extent of p53-induced apoptosis was gradually
increased with the increase of p53 transient expression (Fig. 1A).
However, when combined with LPS stimulation, the extent of

www.aacrjournals.org

apoptosis was significantly increased (132% by 4 h of LPS
treatment) compared with the controls (8% for untreated, 11%
for 0 h treated). After 8 h, the effect had increased slightly but then
leveled off (148% after 8 h, 152% at 10 h, 151% at 12 h, 154% at 14 h,
and 158% at 16 h; Fig. 1B). Additionally, the accumulation of p53,
caspase-3, or p21 was clearly observed at the 4-h time point, but
these quickly returned back to baseline protein levels 8 h after
treatment. In contrast, no increase of LITAF protein was found
before 4 h, but it was gradually increased after 8 h of treatment
(Fig. 1B).
Identification of LITAF promoter constructs. The full-length
LITAF promoter DNA (pGLP990) and its derived deletions were
subcloned into pGL3-basic, a plasmid lacking a promoter sequence.
Sequence analysis of our clone showed that it was almost identical
to human LITAF promoter (Genbank accession no. AB074031) but
with a few differences: one base was shifted from g to a in position
899; one base ‘‘t’’ was added at 14; and an additional sequence
with 26 bases ‘‘aaacaaaaccaaaacaaacaaaaaaa’’ was present in the
region (83 to 58) of the 5¶ UTR. Finally, no TATA box was
recognized, although three GC boxes were identified (Fig. 1C).
Functional analysis of the LITAF promoter by 5¶ upstream
deletions. To examine whether the LITAF promoter contains selftransactivation activity, and to further determine which region
might respond to this activity, we generated deletion promoter
constructs containing the 1,090-bp promoter vector (990 to +100)
and a series of 5¶ upstream sequence deletions. Each of these
constructs, the full-length luciferase reporter construct pGLP990
and deletion constructs pGLP700, pGLP600, pGLP550, pGLP500,
pGLP450, and pGLP400 (Fig. 1D), was individually transfected into

pGLP700 (98%), pGLP600 (96%), pGLP550 (83%), pGLP500 (34%),
pGLP450 (3.5%), and pGLP400 (2.8%). Thus, the results showed that
the element required for self-transactivation activity is mainly
located in the region upstream to 500 (Fig. 1D, open columns).
p53-dependent inhibition of LITAF promoter activity. To
examine whether LITAF promoter activity could be regulated by
p53, H1299 cells (p53/) were cotransfected with pGLP700 and
p53-1, and then protein extracts were analyzed by Western blot.
The results show that the transient transfection of increasing
concentrations of p53-1 from 0.1 to 0.5 Ag caused a concomitant
decrease in LITAF promoter-activated luciferase gene expression
(Fig. 2A). To further characterize the effect of p53 on the responsive
region of the LITAF promoter, H1299 cells were cotransfected with
0.5 Ag pGLP700, pGLP600, pGLP550, pGLP500, pGLP450, or
pGLP400 plus 0.5 Ag p53-1. As shown in Fig. 2B (lane 2, 4, or 6),
luciferase gene expression induced by the LITAF promoter in the
responsive region from 550 to 500 was completely blocked by
cotransfection of 0.5 Ag p53-1. Direct measurement of luciferase
production also showed the inhibition of gene expression when
functional p53 was present (Fig. 2C).
p53 binding activity. To analyze the direct binding of p53 to the
LITAF promoter, p53 protein was immunoprecipitated (IP-p53) and
confirmed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3A, the IP-p53 protein
sample contains both endogenous and exogenous p53 but is devoid
of any actin contamination (lane 5 and 7), suggesting that our
IP-p53 protein was highly purified. Subsequently, EMSA was done
in the appropriate reaction buffer with 1 Ag IP-p53 and 32P-labeled
DNA probe (600 to 400, 600 to 440, 560 to 400, 600 to
400D-480 to 440, 600 to 400D-520 to 480, or 600 to
400D-560 to 520) in separate lanes. Lane 2 contained a 100-fold
excess of unlabeled competitor. Clearly, the LITAF promoter DNA
from 600 to 400 lacking a sequence from 480 to 440 (lane 5)
did not significantly affect the p53 binding. However, the deletions
ranging from 520 to 480 (lane 6), 560 to 520 (lane 7), or
from 600 to 560 (lane 8) completely blocked the binding
(Fig. 3B). These results suggest that p53 directly binds within the
region from 600 to 480 of the LITAF promoter.
To determine which p53 binding domain inhibits LITAF
promoter activity, a series of human p53 constructs were created.
Several of the major constructs, p53-1, A12, B1, C6, D10, and
p53LFB12, are shown in Fig. 4A. The proteins extracted from the
p53-null H1299 cells transiently transfected with the p53 construct
noted above plus pGLP700 were assessed for luciferase assay. The
promoter activity of pGLP700 alone was assigned the maximal
value of 100%. As shown in Fig. 4B, the LITAF promoter activity
was strongly reduced to 9% of control after the transient
transfection of wt p53 (p53-1). Partial LITAF promoter activity
(73% or 61%) was still maintained by the overexpression of either
A12 or B1, which lacked amino acids 101 to 167 or amino acids 167
to 234, respectively. Construct C6, containing amino acid 167 and
its flanking sequences, which lacked amino acids 235 to 300,
reduced LITAF promoter activity to 22% of control. This suggested
that the specific residues playing an important role in inhibition of
LITAF promoter activity were located in the region around amino
acid 167. Thus, the DNA clones D10 and p53LFB12, which either
possessed (D10) or lacked (p53LFB12) amino acid 167 and its
flanking sequences, were constructed. Construct D10, lacking
amino acids 156 to 178, completely lost the ability to inhibit

to 400D-520 to 480; lane 7, 600 to 400D-560 to 520; lane 8, 560 to

to the appropriate reaction buffer with the DNA probe noted above each lane.
In lane 2, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled competitor was also added. Arrows,

LITAF promoter activity. In contrast, p53LFB12, which possessed
only a short 7-amino-acid peptide representing amino acids 164 to
170 (K164Q165S166Q167H168M169T170), significantly reduced
LITAF promoter activity to 31% of control (Fig. 4B, condition 7).
Furthermore, we were interested in whether transfection of this
sequence would also affect the regulation of the endogenous
LITAF gene expression. Thus, the DNAs of p53-1, D10, or p53LFB12,
as test samples and non-DNA or pGLP700 alone as negative
controls were, respectively, transfected into p53-null H1299 cells.
The protein extracts from these transfected cells were analyzed by
Western blot with antibodies against LITAF or actin as control. As
shown in Fig. 4C, the protein level of the endogenous LITAF gene
expression was not changed by the transient transfection of D10
(lane 4) or of pGLP700 (lane 2) but was greatly reduced by
transient transfection of p53-1 (lane 3) or p53LFB12 (lane 5)
compared with the untreated control (lane 1). These results
suggest that the production of LITAF is specifically down-regulated
by a p53 short peptide (amino acid KQSQHMT) interacting with
LITAF promoter.

p53 Short Peptide in LITAF/TNF Production

Consequently, a short peptide (p53pep164) that contained seven
residues (amino acids 164–170; K164Q165S166Q167H168M169T170) corresponding to p53LFB12 and another peptide
(pepSC) with the reverse sequence of p53pep164 as a negative
control were synthesized and analyzed using the luciferase assay.
As shown in Fig. 5A, treatment with varying amounts of p53pep164
(Fig. 5A, 8–10; 1, 10, or 100 Ag/mL) plus pGLP700 caused a gradual
but significant decrease (66% for no. 8, 40% for no. 9, or 15% for no.
10) in LITAF promoter activity compared with the controls
transfected with pGLP700 alone (100% for no. 2) or pGLP700 plus
100 Ag/mL pepSC (95% for no. 7). Treatment with peptide alone
without pGLP700 did not affect the assay (1.5% for no. 5 or 2.3% for
no. 6). To determine which region of the LITAF promoter is the
specific site for p53 binding, we introduced p53pep164 (100 Ag/mL)
plus pGLP700 (no. 12) or pGLP550 (no. 14); these significantly
reduced LITAF promoter activity to 15% or 23% of control.
However, the same treatment with p53pep164 plus pGLP500 did
not affect LITAF promoter activity (no. 16) compared with the
control (no. 15). This p53pep164-dependent inhibition of LITAF
was evaluated by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 5B, transfection of
either DNA (p53-1) or peptide (p53pep164) into primary human
monocytes inhibited LPS-induced LITAF production (lane 3 or 5)
compared with controls (lane 1, 2, or 4). These findings suggest
that the site from 550 to 500 in the LITAF promoter is specific
for p53 binding activity.
Analysis of p53pep164-mediated cytokine gene expression in
response to LPS stimulation. To further examine the effects of
p53pep164 on LPS-induced cytokine production, human monocytes (1  106) were stimulated with 0.1 Ag/mL E. coli LPS plus
p53pep164 or plus pepSC as negative control (Fig. 6A).
Production of 27 cytokines in treated or untreated control cell

cultures were measured by the Bio-Plex 200 System. As a positive
control, the cytokines induced by cells treated solely with LPS
were assigned the maximal value of 100%. As shown in Fig. 6B
(no. 10), nine LPS-induced cytokines were significantly reduced
by p53pep164 administration: 33% for platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF), 49% for interleukin-1h (IL-1h), 77% for IL-15, 35%
for IFN-g, 24% for IP-10, 60% for IL-6, 74% for RANTES, 19% for
TNF-a, and 58% for IL-1ra, relative to the positive control.
Similarly, the significant reduction of these cytokines mediated
by p53pep164 (Fig. 6B, no. 10) could also be observed if cells
were transiently transfected with p53-1 (wt) DNA (no. 4). In
addition, no effect of pepSC on LPS-induced cytokine production
could be observed (no. 7), suggesting that p53pep164 as a short
peptide substitute for p53 not only down-regulates LITAF gene
expression but also significantly decreases the production of nine
cytokines.

Discussion
We have previously investigated the regulation of LPS-induced
inflammatory cytokine expression (9–11). In the process, we
identified a transcription factor (LITAF) that contributes to the
regulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a. A report
from the Vogelstein group unexpectedly linked LITAF/PIG7 and
p53 (7). In the present article, we have further characterized the
interaction between LITAF and p53. We have engineered LITAF
promoter DNA/luciferase constructs, which allowed us to probe
their p53-mediated promoter activity. We have found that the
element required for p53-directed transcriptional activity is
mainly located in the region from 990 to 500 of the LITAF
promoter, and that the specific site required for p53 protein-DNA

binding seems to be located between 550 and 500.
Surprisingly, p53 did not up-regulate LITAF promoter activity as
anticipated (7). To the contrary, we have found that the transient
transfection of either p53LFB12 DNA or its corresponding
synthetic peptide, called p53pep164, that contains seven amino
acids of p53 in the region from 164 to 170 (K164Q165S166Q167H168M169T170) significantly reduced LITAF promoter
activity to 15% of that typically observed in p53-null H1299 cells
(Fig. 5).
Recent studies showed that p53 can suppress the activation of
some transcription factors (13–16), leading to apoptosis via
cytokine activation. However, the signaling pathway whereby p53
activates cytokine-related apoptosis in response to LPS stimulation
remains unclear. Consistent with these data, the present study
shows that transfection of p53 (wt) or introduction of exogenous

12REV (3 ) as control using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) for 3 h; washed
with PBS; and further treated with peptide: 100 Ag/mL pepSC (7), p53pep164
at 1 Ag/mL (8), 10 Ag/mL (9), or 100 Ag/mL (10, 12, 14, and 16), after which
cells were incubated in appropriate medium at 37jC overnight. Luciferase
activities of the lysates from each culture of treated cells were measured. The
extracts from untreated (1), pepSC alone (5 ), p53pep164 alone (6), pGLP700
alone (2 and 11), pGLP550 alone (13), or pGLP500 alone (15 ) were used as
controls. Triplicate assays were done. B, human monocytes (1  106) were
transfected with p53-1 DNA or p53pep164 or pepSC as negative control before
treatment with 0.1 Ag/mL E. coli LPS. Cell extracts from each treatment were

p53pep164 into normal human monocytes significantly reduced
LPS-induced production of several cytokines: PDGF, IFN-g,
RANTES, IP-10, IL-1h, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-15, and TNF-a; this downregulation seems to be LITAF dependent. Our data are also
supported by recent studies showing that LPS induces apoptosis in
endothelial cells, leading to microvascular injury in numerous
tissues in lung, gut, or liver, during sepsis (17, 18). Furthermore,
upon LPS treatment, some apoptotic genes, such as p21, Bax,
caspase-1, or caspase-3, are found to be induced (19, 20). Under
these conditions, stabilization of p53 is clearly observed (21).
Further support is provided by recent studies showing that the
overexpression of p53 within 24 h in human and rabbit synovial
cells can significantly reduce the leukocytic infiltrate, suggesting
that p53 production is able to induce synovial apoptosis and to
reduce inflammation (22). Finally, p53 wt DNA delivered into
human rhabdomyosarcoma cells is found to down-regulate
proinflammatory genes, such as IL-15 (23).
Previous studies have indicated that LPS activates both LITAF
and p53 gene expression (21, 24). Here, we found that p53 downregulated LITAF gene expression and prompted us to investigate
how p53 could affect LITAF-dependent cytokine production,
including TNF-a in response to LPS stimulation. To further
understand this process, we hypothesized that the time course
for p53 gene expression and the consequent effects might differ
from that regulating the LITAF response to LPS. Our data show
that in p53-transfected cells, apoptosis is increased regardless of
LITAF down-regulation. Furthermore, we observed that LPS
stimulation significantly induced apoptosis and the accumulation
of p53 and p53 target gene caspase-3 or p21 within 4 h after LPS
treatment. However, the extent of apoptosis was relatively
constant z8 h after LPS treatment following an initial burst
(4 h). As the protein levels of p53, p21, and caspase-3 also quickly
returned to baseline levels by about 8 h, we conclude that LPSactivated p53 is a short-lived phenomenon. This suggests that
apoptosis mediated by p53 and/or p53-activated p21 or caspase-3
only happens during a brief window at the initiation stage of LPS
stimulation. During this time, transcription factors including
LITAF will be inhibited by p53 in cells that are not destined for
apoptosis. This could explain why cytokine production mediated
by LPS via LITAF or other factors was not observed. However,
after p53 levels returned to baseline (f8 h), LPS-induced LITAF
activation and LITAF-mediated cytokine production could
commence (Fig. 1A and B).
Additionally, it is well known that p53 binds to a consensus DNA
binding sequence, consisting of two repeats of the 10-bp motif 5¶GGGC(A/T)(T/A)GCCC-3¶. Furthermore, several reports have
claimed that a sequence with ‘‘GGGCTTGCTT’’ or ‘‘AGACAAGCCT’’
could function as a p53 binding site, and that deletion of these
sequences could lead to an unbinding of p53 (25–28). However, the
site ranging from 600 to 500 of LITAF promoter that was
specifically identified in this study as a p53-binding site differed
from the p53 motif reported. Thus, it is proposed that p53 peptide
p53pep164 regulates cytokines by binding to a novel consensus
p53-binding motif in the promoter of the target transcription
factors. Therefore, further investigations of the p53 motif at the site
of the LITAF promoter, by footprinting and point mutagenesis, may
be warranted.
Because p53pep164 substitutes for p53 in binding activity, we
were interested to know whether this short peptide also mediates
LPS-induced LITAF enhancement of TNF-a production. The
present data show that p53pep164 treatment of human monocytes

down-regulated LPS-induced LITAF and TNF-a production,
advocating for p53 as a key molecular node regulating gene
expression in an inflammatory response (27). Furthermore, LITAF/
PIG7 has been found to be involved in the carcinogenesis of
extramammary Paget’s disease (29); therefore, further investigation
is warranted to determine whether this short 7-amino-acid p53
peptide (KQSQHMT) plays an important role in p53-regulated
LITAF-mediated processes. Taken together, our findings highlight
the influence of a 7-amino-acid p53 peptide that binds specifically
and with high affinity to the LITAF promoter. Our results pave the
