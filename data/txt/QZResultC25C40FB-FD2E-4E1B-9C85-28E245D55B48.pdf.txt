Abstract
The use of agents to prevent the onset of and/or the progression
to breast cancer has the potential to lower breast cancer risk.
We have previously shown that the tumor-suppressor gene p53
is a potential mediator of hormone (estrogen/progesterone)induced protection against chemical carcinogen–induced
mammary carcinogenesis in animal models. Here, we show
for the first time a breast cancer–protective effect of chloroquine in an animal model. Chloroquine significantly reduced
the incidence of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea–induced mammary
tumors in our animal model similar to estrogen/progesterone
treatment. No protection was seen in our BALB/c p53-null
mammary epithelium model, indicating a p53 dependency for
the chloroquine effect. Using a human nontumorigenic
mammary gland epithelial cell line, MCF10A, we confirm that
in the absence of detectable DNA damage, chloroquine
activates the tumor-suppressor p53 and the p53 downstream
target gene p21, resulting in G1 cell cycle arrest. p53 activation
occurs at a posttranslational level via chloroquine-dependent
phosphorylation of the checkpoint protein kinase, ataxia
telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), leading to ATM-dependent
phosphorylation of p53. In primary mammary gland epithelial
cells isolated from p53-null mice, chloroquine does not induce
G1 cell cycle arrest compared with cells isolated from wildtype mice, also indicating a p53 dependency. Our results
indicate that a short prior exposure to chloroquine may have
a preventative application for mammary carcinogenesis.

Introduction
Breast cancer remains the major cancer among women in the
United States with >200,000 new cases annually (1). Breast cancer
incidence rates are influenced by age, genetics, radiation,
socioeconomic status, diet, ethnicity, and reproductive history.
However, the strongest protective factor is related to reproductive
history, that is, early age at first pregnancy (V20 years of age), which
confers a 50% reduction in lifetime risk compared with the lifetime
risk of breast cancer in nulliparous women (2, 3).
The protective effect of early pregnancy against chemical
carcinogen–induced mammary carcinogenesis has been shown in
both rat and mouse models (4–6). The effect of pregnancy on the
protection against carcinogen-induced mammary cancer is mimNote: C.R. Loehberg and T. Thompson contributed equally to this work.

icked by treatment with estrogen and progesterone (4, 5, 7).
However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the protective
effect are poorly understood. In studies using the Wistar-Furth rat
and BALB/c mouse models, we showed that hormone-induced
protection is manifested at the cellular level as a block in
carcinogen-induced proliferation shortly after carcinogen treatment (4, 5, 7). The availability of the BALB/c p53-null mammary
epithelium model provided a means to test the functional role of
p53 in hormone-induced protection (8–11). We showed that the
absence of p53 abrogates the protective effect of hormones against
chemical carcinogen–induced mammary cancer (10–12). These
results suggested the general hypothesis that p53 is up-regulated in
a persistent fashion by hormonal stimulation of the virgin gland
and that p53 functions in part to retard cell cycle progression in
response to carcinogen-induced DNA damage.
p53 can be activated by several phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)–related kinases (PIKK), including ataxia telangiectasiamutated (ATM), ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR); and the ATM downstream effector checkpoint kinases Chk1 or Chk2 that phosphorylate
the NH2-terminal transactivation domain of p53 at multiple sites
(e.g., serines 6, 9, 15, 20, 37, and 46; refs. 13–17). Recent studies
showed that not only DNA damage but also chromatin modifications are sufficient to activate the ATM protein kinase, which, in
turn, is able to activate p53 (18). Chromatin modifiers such as the
antimalarial agent chloroquine activate ATM via autophosphorylation at serine 1981, which results in the phosphorylation of p53 at
serine 15 in fibroblasts (18, 19). Furthermore, members of the quinoline sulfonamide family, like chloroquine, induce cell cycle arrest,
apoptosis, and differentiation in breast cancer cell lines (20–23).
Importantly, it was recently shown that chloroquine not only
reduces proliferation in cellular models, but impairs spontaneous
lymphoma development in a mouse model (24). Here, we further
show a cancer protective effect of chloroquine and show that a
short prior exposure to chloroquine is preventative against
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (NMU)–induced mammary carcinogenesis
in our rat model similar to estrogen/progesterone treatment. No
protection was seen in our BALB/c p53-null mammary epithelium
model, suggesting a p53 dependency of the chloroquine effect. We
show that in a human nontumorigenic mammary gland epithelial
cell line, MCF10A, chloroquine up-regulates the tumor-suppressor
p53, its downstream target gene p21 leading to G1 cell cycle arrest.
These findings indicate that the tumor protective effect of
chloroquine may be mediated in part by a p53 pathway.

spontaneous immortalization from cell cultures established from the s.c.
mastectomy of a woman with fibrocystic disease (25). Briefly, MCF10A cells
were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 5% horse
serum, 0.02 Ag/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), 0.5 Ag/mL hydrocortisone, 10 Ag/mL insulin, 0.1 Ag/mL cholera toxin, 100 units/mL penicillin,
and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin.
Cells were treated with 10 or 50 Amol/L chloroquine (Sigma) for 4, 24,
48, or 72 h. For Western blot analyses, cells were pretreated with medium
containing reduced horse serum (0.1%) for 24 h. As positive controls for
several antibodies, cells were either g-irradiated with 10 Gy or treated with
10 Amol/L trichostatin A (Sigma).
The primary mammary gland epithelial cells were derived from 8-weekold p53-null or p53-WT BALB/c mice 9. The left and right thoracic and
inguinal mammary glands were aseptically removed, pooled, and the
epithelial cells were isolated according to ref. 9. The cells were plated on
collagen-coated flasks and grown in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented
with 2% FCS, 5 ng/mL EGF, 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 10 Ag/mL
insulin, 50 Ag/mL gentamicin, and 20 units/mL nystatin.

Short Interfering RNA Transfection
Validated small interfering RNAs (siRNA) for p53 and ATM were
purchased from Dharmacon (siGENOME SMARTpool reagent) and transiently transfected into MCF10A cells using TransIT siQuest from Mirus
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. At 24 h posttransfection, MCF10A
cells were treated with chloroquine, as described above and harvested
24 h later for protein and flow cytometry analyses.

Western Blot Analysis
Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared with NEPER lysis buffer
kit (Pierce). For Western blotting, the lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE
and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane according to standard
protocols. The blots were stained with the following primary antibodies:
p53 (FL-393), p53 (DO-1), Chk1 (G-4), Chk2 (A-11) from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; murine double minute 2 (MDM2; AB-2) from Calbiochem;
p27 (Kip1) and p21 (Cip1/Waf1) from BD Biosciences PharMingen; acetyl–
p53-K373/382, phospho–histone-H2AX-S139 (JBW301), ATM from Upstate;
Bax, phospho–p53-S6,9,15,20,37,46, phospho–Chk1-S345, phospho–Chk2Th68 from Cell Signaling; ATR (BL117) from Bethyl; and h-actin (AC-74,
as loading control) from Sigma. The phospho–ATM-S1981 antibody was
kindly provided by Dr. M.B. Kastan (18). Protein bands were visualized with
anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham) or the Super Signal West Femto Kit (Pierce). Amounts of proteins
were quantified with a scanner densitometer (Molecular Dynamics).

Flow Cytometry
MCF10A cells were trypsinized into single-cell suspension, fixed in icecold 70% ethanol, and stored at 4jC. Before analysis, cells were resuspended
in 100 Ag/mL RNase A (Promega), 40 Ag/mL propidium iodide in PBS.
To determine the percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cells, trypsinized
cells were collected and stained with Annexin V FITC and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD), according to standard protocols. Analysis was done
on a Becton Dickinson fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACScan).
Differences of MCF10A cells after chloroquine treatment were examined by
Student’s t test with P < 0.05 considered as statistically significant.

Animals
Rats. Female Wistar-Furth rats were purchased from National Cancer
Institute. The Wistar-Furth female rat is an inbred strain of rats sensitive to
both NMU- and 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene–induced mammary
adenocarcinomas. Rats were acclimatized to our animal facility before
experimental manipulation.
Mice. All donor and recipient BALB/c mice were bred and maintained at
Baylor College of Medicine. The donor mice were p53 homozygous null, and
the recipient mice were p53 wild-type (WT; ref. 8).
All animals were housed by using approved American Association of
Laboratory Animal Care guidelines under conditions of a 12-h light/dark
cycle, and permitted ad libitum access to food and water. All experiments

were performed in accordance with NIH guidelines for experimental
animals.

Tumorigenesis Studies in Chloroquine-Treated Wistar-Furth
Rats and BALB/c Mice
Wistar-Furth rats. For the studies on chloroquine-induced resistance to
the carcinogen NMU (Sigma), 48-day-old Wistar-Furth virgin female rats,
were given three i.p. injections of chloroquine, 3.5 mg/kg of body weight,
1 week apart. At 63 days old, 1 day after the final chloroquine-injection
(at day 62), Wistar-Furth rats were given an i.p. injection of NMU, 50 mg/kg
of body weight. An age-matched control group of rats also received NMU
injections. All mammary tumors appearing in the ensuing 35 weeks were
collected, and processed for histology and pathologic evaluation. Tumors
were evaluated by routine H&E staining. The vast majority of the mammary
tumors of both groups were adenocarcinomas of the solid or papillary
variety. Tumor incidences and latencies were statistically evaluated and
differences between groups were tested for statistical significance by using
the two-sided Student’s t test. Results were considered significantly different
at P < 0.05.
BALB/c mice. The mammary ducts were isolated from 7- to 8-week-old
p53-null BALB/c mice and transplanted into the cleared mammary fat pads
of 3-week-old WT BALB/c mice. The transplanted duct samples grew and
filled the fat pad in 6 to 8 weeks. For each group, two mammary fat pads
were processed as whole mounts at 8 weeks to examine the growth rate and
morphology of the outgrowth. Those mice were treated weekly for 8 weeks
with chloroquine (3.5 mg/kg of body weight) starting at 8 weeks after
transplantation so the mice were 11 to 12 weeks old when the treatment
started. The mice (n = 20 per group) were palpated weekly for mammary
tumors for 60 weeks posttransplantation. Tumors and nontumoral tissue
were evaluated by routine H&E staining. Tumor incidences and latencies
were statistically evaluated, and differences between groups were tested for
statistical significance by using the Fisher’s exact test. Results were
considered significantly different at P < 0.05.

Results
Chloroquine shows breast cancer protective effects in
animal models in a p53-dependent manner. To investigate
whether chloroquine has an effect in mammary gland tissue
in vivo, we designed an experiment in rats based on our earlier
work showing that estrogen/progesterone treatment is protective
against NMU-induced mammary tumors in female Wistar-Furth
rats (7). Rats were treated thrice (once a week) over a period of
three weeks with chloroquine (3.5 mg/kg of body weight) before
treatment with NMU (50 mg/kg of body weight) to induce
mammary gland adenocarcinomas (Fig. 1A). In the untreated rats,
mammary tumor incidence was 67% (16 of 24) with the first tumor
onset at 8 weeks after NMU. In comparison, rats that received
chloroquine treatment exhibited a reduced tumor incidence of
only 41% (10 of 24; P < 0.05) with a delayed tumor onset at
12 weeks (P < 0.05) post-NMU (Fig. 1A). In addition, the growth
rate of tumors was significantly slower in the chloroquine-treated
rats compared with the untreated controls (data not shown).
A mouse model that mimics essential biological and genetic
attributes of a subset of human breast cancer is the BALB/c p53null mammary epithelium, in which deletion of the tumorsuppressor gene p53 results in enhanced tumorigenic risk (8–11).
The p53-null mammary epithelium progresses through ductal
hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ before becoming invasive
breast cancer (8–11). Because the p53-null mammary epithelial cell
mimics the expression patterns found in subsets of human invasive
breast cancers, we investigated the possible p53-dependency of the
chloroquine-induced breast cancer protective effects in this model.
Using this model, we have previously shown that the p53 null

Figure 1. Chloroquine reduces the incidence of NMU-induced mammary
tumors in WT female Wistar-Furth rats but shows no breast cancer protective
effects in a BALB/c p53-null mammary epithelium model. A, treatment plan:
Wistar-Furth female rats, 48 days old, were given three i.p. injections of
chloroquine, 3.5 mg/kg of body weight, 1 wk apart. At 63 days old, Wistar-Furth
rats were given an i.p. injection of NMU, 50 mg/kg of body weight. An
age-matched control group of rats also received NMU injections. The rats were
palpated weekly for the appearance of tumors and the percentage tumor-bearing
rats were plotted against weeks after the NMU treatment. Tumor incidence,
number, and latency were assessed for 35 wk. Each group contained 24 animals.
Tumor incidences and latencies were statistically evaluated, and differences
between groups were tested for statistical significance by using the two-sided
Student’s t test. Results were considered significantly different at
P < 0.05. B, treatment plan: Mammary ducts were isolated from p53-null BALB/c
mice and transplanted into WT BALB/c mice. Those mice were either left
untreated or treated weekly for 8 wk with chloroquine (3.5 mg/kg of body weight)
starting at 8 wk after transplantation so the mice were 11 to 12 wk old when the
treatment started. The mice were palpated weekly for the appearance of tumors
and the percent mammary tumor-free mice were plotted against weeks after
transplantation. The tumor incidences were 41% (12 of 29) and 50% (18 of 36)
in the untreated and chloroquine-treated mice, respectively (P > 0.05).

mammary epithelium develops spontaneous breast cancer when
transplanted into WT BALB/c mice, and showed that the absence
of p53 tumor-suppressor gene function abrogates the protective
effect of estrogen/progesterone against carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis in those BALB/c mice (10–12).
Accordingly, the mammary ducts were isolated from p53-null
BALB/c mice and transplanted into WT BALB/c mice. The mice
were treated weekly for 8 weeks with chloroquine (3.5 mg/kg of
body weight) starting at 8 weeks after transplantation (at 11–12
weeks of age). No protection was seen in our BALB/c p53-null

mammary epithelium model, suggesting a p53 dependency
(Fig. 1B). Importantly, this is the first indication that chloroquine
can prevent breast cancer in an animal model similar to estrogen/
progesterone treatment and shows a p53 dependency supporting
the cellular results.
Chloroquine inhibits MCF10A cell proliferation via G1 cell
cycle arrest. To address the molecular mechanisms by which
chloroquine prevents mammary tumorigenesis in vivo, we performed flow cytometry to determine whether chloroquine affects
the cell cycle in MCF10A cells at concentrations that do not induce
significant cytotoxicity. The DNA content of propidium iodide–
stained nuclei from untreated and chloroquine-treated cells were
analyzed as shown in Fig. 2A. At 24 h incubation, the percentage of
cells in the G1 phase was 52% in the control, 64% with 10 Amol/L,
and 76% with 50 Amol/L chloroquine treatment (P < 0.05; similar
numbers occurred at 48 and 72 h, data not shown). To determine
whether chloroquine induces apoptosis in addition to G1 cell cycle
arrest, we stained the MCF10A cells with Annexin V–FITC
(apoptosis marker) and 7-AAD (necrosis marker). As shown in
Fig. 2B, in the untreated MCF10A cell population only 5% of the cells
undergo apoptosis, and after treatment with 10 Amol/L chloroquine
no significant change in apoptosis is detectable. Although the
50 Amol/L chloroquine treatment results in an increase in apoptotic
cells, the level of apoptosis (10% of cells) is still very low, indicating
that chloroquine does not cause significant cytotoxicity. In
summary, chloroquine induces cell cycle arrest in MCF10A cells at
a low 10 Amol/L concentration that does not induce cytotoxicity.
Chloroquine up-regulates p53 and its downstream target
gene p21. Because loss of p53 abrogates the tumor protective
effect of chloroquine, we next examined whether chloroquine also
induces up-regulation of p53 in the MCF10A cells as shown
previously in fibroblasts (18) and MCF7 breast cancer cells (22).
Indeed, p53 protein levels were increased in nuclear extracts of
chloroquine-treated MCF10A cells at 4 h (1.5-fold at 10 Amol/L and
2.7-fold at 50 Amol/L) and 24 h (3-fold at 10 and 50 Amol/L;
Fig. 2C). Increase in nuclear p53 protein level after chloroquine
treatment was confirmed by immunocytochemistry (data not
shown). Increases in p53 protein levels generally reflect regulation
at the posttranscriptional rather than at the transcriptional level
(26–28). In agreement with this, we did not detect any increase in
p53 transcripts after chloroquine treatment, measured by quantitative PCR from control and chloroquine-treated MCF10A cells
(data not shown), suggesting that the increase in p53 protein levels
reflects regulation at the posttranscriptional level.
To determine whether chloroquine-induced cell cycle arrest is
associated with up-regulation of the p53-dependent cell cycle
inhibitor p21, we examined the levels of the p21 protein after
chloroquine treatment. As shown in Fig. 2C, significant upregulation (3-fold at 10 Amol/L and 6-fold at 50 Amol/L) of p21
(Waf1/Cip1) was detected by Western blot analysis in our model.
In addition to p21, p27 (Kip1), a member of the Cip/Kip family of
cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors (29), was up-regulated
(up to 4.7-fold at 10 Amol/L) after 24 h chloroquine treatment
(Fig. 2C). Both p21 and p27 play a significant role in cell cycle arrest
via enforcing G1 restriction point by inhibitory binding to cdk2/
cyclin E or other cdk/cyclin complexes (29). We also examined the
level of expression of bax, a proapoptotic mediator of p53dependent apoptosis (30); no significant up-regulation was
detected for bax (Fig. 2C).
Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53, plays a central role
through a p53-Mdm2 autoregulatory loop to regulate the stability

of p53 via ubiquitination and degradation (31). Due to increased
p53 levels, total mdm2 protein levels were also increased (up to 6.6fold at 10 Amol/L for 4 h) with chloroquine treatment (Fig. 2C),
consistent with the role of mdm2 as a p53 target gene. Taken
together, we show chloroquine-induced up-regulation of p53 and
p21, the key players for G1 cell cycle arrest in the MCF10A cells
similar to our estrogen/progesterone protection model.
p53 is required for the chloroquine-induced G1 cell cycle
arrest of MCF10A cells. To determine if there is a functional
requirement for p53 in the chloroquine-induced G1 cell cycle arrest,
flow cytometry propidium iodide staining was performed in p53siRNA–transfected MCF10A cells, and p53 expression was monitored by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, no increased G1 cell
cycle arrest was detected after 10 Amol/L chloroquine treatment in
cells transfected with p53-siRNA. Moreover, treatment with p53siRNA abolished the chloroquine stimulation of the cell cycle
regulator p21 (Fig. 3B).
To further confirm the functional requirement of p53, we
isolated primary mammary gland epithelial cells from our WT and
p53-null BALB/c mice. Flow cytometry profiles of nuclear DNA
content revealed that chloroquine promotes G1 cell cycle arrest
only in the p53-WT cells but not in p53-null cells neither at
10 Amol/L (Fig. 3C), nor at 50 Amol/L (data not shown). Thus,
p53 is required for the chloroquine-induced G1 cell cycle arrest in
nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells.
Chloroquine causes p53 phosphorylation. The level of p53
activity is regulated by a variety of posttranslational modifications,
including phosphorylation and acetylation that are activated by
distinct stimuli (13–15, 32–34). To determine whether exposure of

mammary epithelial cells to chloroquine results in covalent
modification of p53 in the MCF10A cells, we analyzed the
phosphorylation and acetylation status of p53 by Western blotting.
p53 can be activated by several kinases that phosphorylate
primarily the NH2-terminal transactivation domain of p53 at
multiple sites (e.g., serines 6, 9, 15, 20, 37, and 46; refs. 13–15). Our
analysis of the phosphorylation status of these residues using
phosphorylation site–specific antibodies showed that chloroquine
treatment of MCF10A cells increased p53 phosphorylation only at
serine 15 (8.2-fold at 10 Amol/L and 11-fold at 50 Amol/L for 24 h),
a crucial p53 phosphorylation site that can be phosphorylated
by ATM and that plays an important role in p53 functional activity
(refs. 35, 36; Fig. 4). The time course of chloroquine-induced p53
phosphorylation at serine 15 correlated with the chloroquine
stimulation of p21 production (Fig. 2C). In contrast, phosphorylation of serine 46, which has been shown to be linked to the
transactivation of apoptotic target genes (37), was not increased
with chloroquine treatment. This result is consistent with our flow
cytometry data showing that chloroquine induces only slight
apoptosis at high amounts (Fig. 2B).
The COOH terminus of p53 also plays a key role in the regulation
of p53 function; it is rich in lysines, which are subjected to
acetylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation (32–34). Phosphorylation of serine 20 and 46 strengthens the association with the
acetyltransferases p300 and CBP, leading to acetylation at lysines
373 and 382 in the COOH-terminal regulatory domain (13).
This increases the DNA-binding activity of p53 and modulates
its interaction with transcription factors (32–34). Consistent with
our data showing no significant phosphorylation at serine 20 or 46,

Figure 2. Chloroquine induces G1 cell cycle arrest already at low doses (10 Amol/L), and slight apoptosis only at higher doses (50 Amol/L), and up-regulates p53
and its downstream target genes mdm2, p27 , and especially the cell cycle inhibitor p21 but not the proapoptotic bax protein. Exponentially growing nontumorigenic

example of experiments done in triplicate).

we did not detect any increase in acetylated p53 after chloroquine
treatment (Fig. 4). These results suggest a serine 15 selective
modulation of p53 occurs following chloroquine.
Chloroquine phosphorylates p53 through the ATM signaling pathway. p53 phosphorylation at serine 15 is mainly
transduced through the PIKKs ATM, ATR, and the DNA-activated
protein kinase (DNA-PK; ref. 13), which predicts that inhibitors
of the PI3K family of enzymes should suppress chloroquineinduced phosphorylation of p53. To test this concept, MCF10A
cells were treated with chloroquine in the presence or absence of
wortmannin, an inhibitor of PIKK ATM and DNA-PK (38).
Wortmannin completely blocked ATM-mediated serine 15 phosphorylation of p53 in our model (data not shown), suggesting a
PIKK requirement for serine 15 phosphorylation. Because
previous studies have indicated that chloroquine can activate
ATM by phosphorylation at serine 1981 in fibroblast cells (18, 19),
we next asked whether specific inhibition of ATM using RNA
interference abrogates p53 phosphorylation of serine 15. As
shown in Fig. 5A, treatment with ATM-siRNA completely
abolished the chloroquine induction of p53 protein phosphorylation at serine 15.
To determine whether chloroquine treatment regulates ATM
phosphorylation in MCF10A cells, we performed Western blots with
a phosphospecific antibody to the serine 1981 of ATM. As shown in
Fig. 5B, ATM was specifically phosphorylated in chloroquinetreated nuclear extracts (6-fold at 10 Amol/L and up to 21-fold at
50 Amol/L for 4 h), under conditions in which p53 protein is
phosphorylated at serine 15. Interestingly, ATM downstream
effectors Chk1 (16) and Chk2 (17) only showed increased
phosphorylation at the later time point in response to chloroquine
(up to 5-fold at 10 and 50 Amol/L at 24 h; Fig. 5B), and ATM-siRNA
still abolished chloroquine-induced phosphorylation of p53 at
serine 15 at this later time point (24 h; Fig. 5A).
The ATM protein kinase may be activated by DNA damage or by
chromatin modifications such as acetylation (18, 19). Therefore, we
determined whether chloroquine activation of the ATM signaling
pathway was due to formation of DNA double-strand breaks.
Western blotting of isolated histone extracts showed that in
MCF10A cells, chloroquine does not induce phosphorylation of
H2AX at serine 139, a well-known DNA breakage marker (39),
compared with irradiation, suggesting that chloroquine does not
activate the ATM-mediated phosphorylation of p53 through
induction of DNA double-strand breaks in MCF10A cells (Fig. 5C).
Additionally, we did not detect any histone hyperacetylation after
chloroquine treatment (Fig. 5C). Taken together, our data indicate
that chloroquine can be used in nontumorigenic mammary
epithelial cells, similar to fibroblasts (18), to activate the tumorsuppressor p53 via the ATM kinase pathway without detectable
DNA damage.

Figure 3. p53 is required for the chloroquine-induced up-regulation of the
cell cycle inhibitor p21 (Waf1/Cip1) and for G1 cell cycle arrest. A, MCF10A

Chloroquine and Breast Cancer

Discussion
We report here that the preventative effects of early pregnancy or
exposure to estrogen/progesterone (4, 7) against mammary
carcinogenesis can be recapitulated by short-term pretreatment of
rats with the drug chloroquine. The first indication that chloroquine
may be useful for later cancer prevention, in addition to treatment of
malaria and rheumatoid diseases, came from a recent study showing
that chronic chloroquine treatment impairs spontaneous lymphomagenesis in mouse models (24). We and others have previously
shown that mammary tissue in young rodents is very susceptible to
the protective effects of pregnancy or pregnancy levels of estrogen/
progesterone (4, 5, 7). Similarly, women who have undergone a fullterm pregnancy early in life are f50% less likely to develop breast
cancer compared with nulliparous women (2, 3). Therefore, we took
the approach to administer chloroquine for only a 2-week period
in young rats to examine whether chloroquine may be used in
prevention of mammary carcinogenesis. The prevention of mammary carcinogenesis by chloroquine was significant, and was
similarly efficient to what we observed previously with lower doses
of estrogen/progesterone treatment (4, 5, 7). However, we only gave
the rats three injections of chloroquine, 3.5 mg/kg of body weight,
during the 2-week treatment regimen. Therefore, by optimizing the
chloroquine dosage, we would expect an even greater response.
Previous studies have indicated that although chloroquine does not
show many side effects during long-term use for treatment of
malaria or rheumatoid diseases, retinal problems are a potential side
effect (40). Based on the ophthalmologic safety guidelines for longterm use of chloroquine in humans (40), chloroquine can be
administered with the low dose of 3.5 mg/kg of body weight daily for
several years. Furthermore, chloroquine shows two interesting
pharmacologic characteristics, extensive tissue accumulation and
prolonged retention in the tissues after drug administration has
ceased (41). Chloroquine has been shown to be retained in the body
for several weeks after a single i.v. dose similar to the conditions in
our animal model (42) and showed impaired spontaneous
lymphomagenesis in mouse models with this low dose (24).

p53 serine 15 phosphorylation. MCF10A cells were treated for the indicated
time points with chloroquine. Cells were harvested and nuclear extracts
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with p53 or the indicated
phosphorylated and acetyl antibodies, and quantitated by scanning densitometry.

Therefore, our result of chloroquine-induced protection against
mammary carcinogenesis at such low levels is highly significant and
promising.
We have previously shown that estrogen/progesterone–induced
prevention of carcinogen-induced mammary carcinogenesis in
rodents is associated with up-regulation of the tumor-suppressor
p53. This results in p53-dependent up-regulation of p21, leading to
cell cycle arrest and a mammary phenotype that is refractory to
carcinogenesis (4, 5, 7). The essential role of p53 was shown by the
abrogation of the refractory phenotype in mammary epithelium
derived from p53-null mice (10–12). As seen with estrogen/
progesterone treatment, where abrogation of p53 diminished
the protective effects, we showed that in the absence of p53,
chloroquine-induced protection against mammary carcinogenesis
in vivo and cell cycle arrest in vitro is lost. These results clearly
confirm an essential role for p53 in the prevention of mammary
carcinogenesis. However, the lack of an appropriate nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cell culture system that responds to
estrogen/progesterone has hampered disclosure of the molecular
mechanisms underlying estrogen/progesterone–dependent activation of p53. Therefore, our observation that chloroquine can mimic
the protective effects of estrogen/progesterone in animals and
induce p53 activation in cultured mammary epithelial cells
suggests that chloroquine may be used in culture systems to
elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying prevention.
The tumor-suppressor p53 is induced in response to a wide array
of signals that stress the cell, and these changes involve
stabilization of the protein and increases in its rate of translation.
The precise mechanism by which chloroquine induces p53 is not
yet resolved. However, our analysis of the chloroquine-induced
posttranslational modifications associated with p53 activation
revealed site-specific phosphorylation at serine 15, whereas other
known NH2-terminal phosphorylation sites and the COOHterminal acetylation status remained unaltered. Phosphorylation
of p53 at serine 15 has been shown to increase in response to some,
but not all, activating signals (35, 36, 38), with some evidence
suggesting that the ATM kinase plays a crucial role in the
phosphorylation of this site. Our results indicate that in the
MCF10A cells, chloroquine indeed activates ATM, another known
tumor suppressor. Specifically, we observed that treatment of cells
with either wortmannin (inhibitor of ATM and DNA-PK; ref. 38),
or ATM-siRNA, disrupts the chloroquine-induced phosphorylation
of p53 at serine 15, indicating that ATM is a principal kinase that
activates p53 in these cells in response to chloroquine. These
results are in agreement with previous studies done in fibroblasts
(18). In the above-mentioned murine lymphoma model, chloroquine still impaired spontaneous lymphoma development in ATMdeficient, but not in p53-deficient mice (24). However, an essential
role for ATM was shown in chloroquine-induced insulin sensitivity
and cardiovascular effects; chloroquine treatment improved blood
pressure and glycemic control in ATM-WT but not ATM-null mice
(43). This suggests that in select cells, chloroquine-induced
signaling pathways require ATM to activate downstream targets
whereas in other systems, p53 (or other targets) may be activated
via ATM-independent pathways.
Previous studies have shown that hormonal (estrogen/progesterone) prevention of carcinogen (NMU)–induced mammary
carcinogenesis in rats is associated with p53-dependent upregulation of the cdk inhibitor p21. This leads to increased cell
cycle arrest in the mammary gland and, importantly, to a
mammary phenotype that is refractory to carcinogenesis (4, 5, 7).

Figure 5. Chloroquine activates p53 through the ATM signaling pathway, but does not generate DNA double-strand breaks or histone hyperacetylation. A, downregulation of ATM abolishes chloroquine-induced p53 phosphorylation at serine 15 (24 h). MCF10A cells were transiently transfected with either control-siRNA or
ATM-siRNA. Cells were harvested and nuclear extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with indicated antibodies (representative example of
experiments done in triplicate). B, chloroquine induces ATM phosphorylation at serine 1981. Cells were treated with chloroquine for the indicated time points, processed
for Western blot analysis with indicated antibodies, and quantitated by scanning densitometry (fold induction after normalization to loading control; representative
example of experiments done in triplicate). C, histones were purified and used in Western blotting experiments with indicated acetyl antibodies, and histone 3 as loading
control. Phospho–H2AX-serine 139 antibody was used as a DNA-breakage marker (representative example of experiments done in triplicate).

Our analysis of the cellular and molecular effects of chloroquine in
cultured nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells supports the
hypothesis that low doses of chloroquine act at least in part also by
inducing G1 cell cycle arrest through a p53-dependent upregulation of p21. Specifically, we showed that chloroquine-induced
G1 cell cycle arrest in the human breast epithelial cells was
dependent on functional p53 and was abrogated in p53-siRNA–
treated MCF10A cells and isolated primary mammary gland
epithelial cells from p53-null BALB/c mice coinciding with loss of
p21. We hypothesize that one mechanism of chloroquine-induced
protection could be through the activation of p53, so that upon
DNA damage (as induced by chemical carcinogen), a memory
response occurs so that p53 is functionally activated to cause G1
cell cycle arrest. Similar to our estrogen/progesterone treatment
model, we hypothesize that this heightened response to inhibit
carcinogen-induced proliferation can protect normal proliferating
cells from the initiation of carcinogenesis but not the promotion of
p53-null preneoplastic cells as shown in our animal models.
Together with the excellent pharmacologic characteristics like
extensive tissue accumulation, chloroquine offers the opportunity
to develop an improved protective strategy for protection of
normal proliferating tissues without affecting the sensitivity of
tumors with mutant p53, for example chemotherapeutic antimitotic agents. Thus, chloroquine may offer a new modality for partial
protection of normal proliferating tissues during antimitotic
chemotherapy of p53-deficient tumors.
Currently, there are very few agents that have a proven ability to
prevent breast cancer and their mechanism of action remains

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

undetermined. We reasoned that possible preventative agents
would include those that augment p53-dependent pathways. We
focused our chemoprevention studies on the antimalarial drug
chloroquine, which can activate the tumor-suppressors ATM and
p53, and which is well-tolerated in humans. The activation of the
tumor-suppressors ATM and p53 by chloroquine is highly
interesting because ATM and p53 deficiencies increase susceptibility to cancer (44–48). Our studies provide further proof-of-principle
for developing prevention therapies based on the modulation of
ATM-p53 pathways, whether based on chloroquine itself or
targeting of other steps in the pathway. Although the mechanism
of chloroquine-induced activation of ATM remains undetermined
and may be cell signaling and context specific, chloroquine is
known to alter chromatin and chromosome structures, which, in
turn, may activate ATM (49–51). Therefore, further studies are
needed to provide insight into the role of chloroquine-regulated
molecular pathways and on the consequences of these events to
susceptibility to carcinogenesis. From a clinical standpoint,
however, our results indicate that chloroquine may have important
preventative applications in breast carcinogenesis.
