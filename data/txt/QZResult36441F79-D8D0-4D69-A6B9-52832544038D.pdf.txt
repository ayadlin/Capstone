Abstract

Author Manuscript

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia in the western countries
and is currently incurable due in part to difficulty in eliminating the leukemia cells protected by
stromal microenvironment. Based on previous observations that CLL cells exhibit mitochondrial
dysfunction and altered lipid metabolism and that carnitine palmitoyltransferases (CPT) play a
major role in transporting fatty acid into mitochondria to support cancer cell metabolism, we
tested several clinically relevant inhibitors of lipid metabolism for their ability to eliminate
primary CLL cells. We discovered that Perhexiline, an anti-angina agent that inhibits CPT, was
highly effective in killing CLL cells in stromal microenvironment at clinically achievable
concentrations. These effective concentrations caused low toxicity to normal lymphocytes and
normal stromal cells. Mechanistic study revealed that CLL cells expressed high levels of CPT1
and CPT2. Suppression of fatty acid transport into mitochondria by inhibiting CPT using
Perhexiline resulted in a depletion of cardiolipin, a key component of mitochondrial membranes,
and compromised mitochondrial integrity leading to rapid depolarization and massive CLL cell
death. The therapeutic activity of Perhexiline was further demonstrated in vivo using a CLL

effectively eliminate leukemia cells in vivo, and is a novel therapeutic strategy for potential

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a lymphoproliferative disorder with variable clinical
courses.1 Despite significant progress in the recent years, CLL still remains an incurable
disease due in part to the persistence of residual leukemia cells after therapy.2–5 The stromal
microenvironment or tissue niches that promote leukemia cell viability and drug resistance is
a major factor contributing to drug resistance in vivo. Although most drugs currently used in
clinical treatment of CLL are effective in inducing leukemia cell death in vitro when CLL
cells are cultured alone, their therapeutic activity decreases substantially in vivo when
stromal cells are present6. The tissue microenvironment protects leukemia cells by multiple
mechanisms, including signaling through direct cell-cell contact, secretion of stromal
factors, and metabolic interactions. 6–10 Thus, development of new therapeutic strategies to
effectively eliminate CLL cells in tissue microenvironment is extremely important in
overcoming in vivo drug resistance and improving therapeutic outcomes.

Our recent studies showed that an important mechanism by which bone marrow stromal
cells protect CLL cells is by promoting glutathione (GSH) synthesis in CLL cells, and that
disabling this protective mechanism by inhibition of the cystine transporter (Xc-) in stromal
cells or by direct depletion of GSH in CLL cells are effective in killing CLL cells in the
presence of stromal cells.6,11,12 Another strategy to overcome stromal mediated drug
resistance is to disrupt stromal-leukemia cell interaction and promote the release of CLL
from their tissue microenvironment into the blood circulation, where leukemia cells might be
more vulnerable to chemotherapeutic agents. The CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 seems able to
function as a chemo-sensitizing agent through such mechanism.13 However, due to the
multiple mechanisms involved in the stromal protection of leukemia cells, inhibition of one
protective mechanism might not be sufficient to effectively overcome drug resistance in
vivo. We speculated that an effective strategy to overcome this problem would be to induce
CLL cells to undergo an intrinsic cell death that cannot be protected by stromal cells. The
main goal of the current study was to test this possibility based on the unique metabolic
properties of CLL cells.
Metabolic abnormalities are a hallmark of transformed cells that may provide growth
advantages.14–17 Beyond the well-known Warburg effect,18 alterations in fatty acids (FAs)
metabolism have also been noted in cancer. In particular, deregulation of lipid metabolism
seems involved in CLL pathogenesis, as suggested by a frequent up-regulation of lipoprotein
lipase (LPL) in CLL cells and its association with poor prognosis.19 FAs are essential

building blocks of biomembranes, and function as important nutrients for energy metabolism
and as the precursors of certain signaling molecules. As such, pharmacological inhibition of
fatty acid synthase (FASN) to suppress the de novo synthesis of FAs and inhibition of
cellular uptake of exogenous FAs are considered as potential therapeutic strategies.20–23 In
this study, we used both in vitro and in vivo experimental systems to test several drugs that
inhibit different steps of FA metabolism for their impact on CLL viability in stromal
microenvironment. Our study identified Perhexiline, a carnitine palmitoyltransferase
inhibitor that suppresses the transport of FA into mitochondria, as a highly effective
compound capable of selective killing CLL cells in the presence of bone marrow stromal
cells and in vivo.

Perhexiline effectively killed CLL cells in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells

Author Manuscript

Previous studies showed that CLL cells have multiple metabolic alterations, including
mitochondrial dysfunction with high ROS generation6,12,24–26 and elevated expression of
lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins to release free fatty
acids.27,28 The deregulation of LPL expression and altered lipid metabolism seems to play a
significant role in CLL pathogenesis.24,29–37 Consistent with these observations, our study
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that CLL cells contained
significantly more mitochondria with an accumulation of lipid droplets compared to normal
B lymphocytes (P<0.01, Supplementary Figure 1). To evaluate the role of lipid metabolism
in CLL cell viability, we tested several clinically relevant lipid metabolic inhibitors for their
ability to kill primary CLL cells. Figure 1a shows several key steps of lipid metabolism and
the respective inhibitors used in this study. Cerulenin, an antifungal antibiotic that inhibits
FASN,38 was used to suppress de novo FA synthesis. Perhexiline, an anti-angina drug that
inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferases 1 and 2 (CPT-1 & CPT-2), was employed to block
fatty acids (LCFAs) transport into mitochondria. Ranolazine, another anti-angina drug, was
used to suppress mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. As shown in Figure 1b, inhibition of
de novo FA synthesis by Cerulenin exhibited cytotoxic effect in CLL cells cultured alone.
However, in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells, Cerulenin lost its cytotoxic effect
against CLL cells (Figure 1b, lower panels), suggesting that this drug would not be effective
in vivo as an anti-CLL agent. Another anti-agina drug ranolazine only exhibited limited
cytotoxic effect in CLL cells even at the drug concentrations up to 500–1000 μM (Figure
1c), suggesting that inhibition of mitochondrial FAs β-oxidation was not a major cytotoxic
event in primary CLL cells.

Author Manuscript

In contrast, blocking FA transport into mitochondria by Perhexiline showed potent cytotoxic
effect against CLL cells when the leukemia cells were cultured alone or co-cultured with
bone marrow stromal cells (Figure 1d). This compound is highly effective in eliminating
CLL cells at the drug concentrations of 5–10 μM, which could be achieved clinically in
angina patients.39 The potent anti-CLL activity of perhexiline was consistently observed in
multiple CLL patient samples in the presence of StromaNktert cells (Figure 1d, right panel).
We also tested the ability of perhexiline to kill CLL cells co-cultured with two other stromal
cell lines (HS-5, KUSA-H1) and obtained similar results (data not shown). In a control

experiment, the drug solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, final concentration 0.1%) did not
cause any significant cytotoxicity (Supplementary Figure 2). These results together showed
that perhexiline was effective in killing CLL cells in the presence of bone marrow stromal
cells, which usually confer resistance to many anticancer agents.
Rapid depletion of mitochondrial cardiolipin in CLL cells by perhexiline as a key
mechanism of cytotoxic action

Author Manuscript

Because blocking the transport of FAs into mitochondria by Perhexiline was highly effective
against CLL cells whereas inhibition of FA β-oxidation by Ranolazine had only modest
cytotoxicity, we reasoned that generation of ATP via β-oxidation was unlikely the critical
mechanism by which mitochondrial FAs support CLL cell survival. Indeed, measurement of
cellular oxygen consumption showed that Perhexiline did not cause any significant decrease
in oxygen consumption (Figure 2a). These data suggest that mitochondrial FAs in CLL cells
might not be used as a major fuel for β-oxidation (which consumes oxygen). This prompted
us to further explore the other possible mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of
Perhexiline.

Author Manuscript

Considering that cardiolipin is a special lipid component of the mitochondrial membranes
and is its synthesis in the mitochondria requires FAs as precursors, we reasoned that
inhibition of FA transport into mitochondria by Perhexiline might impact the synthesis of
cardiolipin. To test this possibility, we used 10-N-nonyl acridine orange (NAO), a
fluorescent dye for staining of cardiolipin11,12,40 and flow cytometry analysis or
quantitation. As shown in Figure 2b, the majority of primary CLL cells rapidly lost their
cardiolipin after incubation with 10 μM Perhexiline. Approximately 60% and 80% of the
drug-treated CLL cells lost their normal cardiolipin contents at 4 h and 6 h, respectively, as
indicated by a substantial left-shift of the NAO fluorescent peak. These data suggest that
inhibition of FA transport into mitochondrial by Perhexiline caused a rapid depletion of
cardiolipin due to a lack of metabolic precursors.
We then tested if incubation of CLL cells with Perhexiline would lead to damage to
mitochondrial membrane integrity. We used rhodamine-123 to measure transmembrane
potential as an indicator of mitochondrial membrane integrity. As shown in Figure 2c, more
than 40% of CLL cells lost their mitochondrial integrity 4 h after Perhexiline incubation.
This was associated with in a release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, as indicated by
a left-shift of the mitochondrial cytochrome c signal in flow cytometry analysis (Figure 2d,
log scale) and a substantial increase in cytosolic cytochrome c at 4 h and beyond (Figure 2e).
Consequently, the release of cytochrome c led massive apoptosis (Figure 2f).

Author Manuscript

Analysis of cellular ATP showed that there was a time-dependent decrease (Figure 2g). The
loss of ATP appeared concurrent with the time-course of cell death. This loss of ATP was
likely due to its leakage from the damaged cells and not due to a decrease in β-oxidation,
since there was no significant decrease in oxygen consumption when the cells were treated
with Perhexiline (Figure 2a). Interestingly, CLL cells exhibited similar sensitivity to
Perhexiline regardless of the present/absent of glucose (Supplementary Figure 3 a and b).
These results also support the conclusion that Perhexiline-induced cell death mainly by
depletion of mitochondrial cardiolipin, and not by inhibition of ATP generation through βOncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 October 28.

oxidation of FAs. Consistently, there was no compensatory increase in glucose uptake when
CLL cells were treated with Perhexiline (Supplementary Figure 3c).
Selective cytotoxicity of Perhexiline against CLL cells with high expression of CPT

Author Manuscript

The potent cytotoxic effect of Perhexiline against primary CLL cells in the presence of
stromal cells suggests that this compound could be effective in killing CLL in vivo. We then
tested if this compound might also be toxic to normal lymphocytes. As shown in Figure 3a,
Perhexiline at a relatively low concentration (5 μM) exhibited potent cytotoxic effect against
CLL cells with only 14% viable cells at 48 h, but the same drug concentration caused only
modest cytotoxicity in normal lymphocytes (68% viable cells). In the presence of bone
marrow stromal cells, 5 μM Perhexiline was still able to induce massive apoptosis (64%) in
CLL cells, but only cause minimum cell death in normal lymphocytes (9%, Figure 3b).
Consistently, analysis of mitochondrial cardiolipin (Figure 3c) and transmembrane potential
(Figure 3d) showed that Perhexiline induced only minimum changes in normal lymphocytes,
even at a higher drug concentration (10 μM). This was in a sharp contrast with the
observations in CLL cells, which showed a rapid depletion of cardiolipin (Figure 2b) and a
substantial loss of transmembrane potential (Figure 2c). We also compared the effect of
Perhexiline (5 μM) in CLL and normal lymphocytes at multiple time points (12, 24 and 48
h), and consistently observed preferential toxicity against CLL cells (Supplementary Figure
4a–4b).

Author Manuscript

To confirm the therapeutic selectivity of Perhexiline, we tested multiple CLL samples (n
=11) and normal lymphocytes isolated from healthy individuals (n=5) with various
concentrations of Perhexiline in the presence and absence of bone marrow stromal cells. The
results again demonstrated that this compound preferentially impacted CLL cells when
stromal cells were either absent (Figure 3e) or present (Figure 3f). We noted that the
therapeutic selectivity was optimal when perhexiline concentrations were between 5–7.5
μM. At a higher concentration, Perhexiline exhibited some toxicity in normal lymphocytes.
We further examined the effect of Perhexiline on bone marrow stromal cells (StromaNKtert),
and showed that this compound did not cause any significant loss of stromal cell viability at
concentrations up to 10 μM (Figure 4a), whereas this drug concentration caused a loss of
over 90% of CLL cell viability (Figure 4b).

Author Manuscript

In an attempt to understand why primary CLL cells exhibited much higher sensitivity to
Perhexiline than to normal cells, we compared the expression of several enzymes involved in
fatty acid metabolism in the leukemia cells and normal cells. As shown in Supplementary
Figure 5 c–f, CLL cells showed higher expression (3–4 folds increase) of most carnitine
palmitoyltransferase isoforms including CPT-1A, CPT-1B, CPT-2, with an exception of
CPT1C (Figure 4c–4f). The expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and lipoprotein lipase
(which involves in uptake of exogenous FAs) was also higher in CLL (Figure 4g–4h). These
data together suggest that CLL cells were highly active in de novo FA synthesis as well as in
uptake of exogenous FAs, likely due to a high requirement of FAs for cardiolipin synthesis.
Comparison of lipoprotein lipase expression in CLL cells and normal lymphocytes revealed
that CLL cells expressed significantly higher levels of LPL (Figure 5a), which has

previously been implicated as a potential prognostic factor for CLL patients whose high
expression is correlated with poor clinical outcome.19,29,30,32,34,37–39,41 We also noted that
among the 12 CLL patient samples tested, the LPL expression levels exhibited substantial
heterogeneity among individual patients. Interestingly, in vitro treatment of CLL cells with
Perhexiline consistently induced a further increase in LPL expression, especially in those
CLL samples with relatively lower basal LPL expression (Figure 5b), suggesting a possible
compensatory response in CLL cells after drug treatment. Similarly, the expression of the
A2 phospholipase isoform iPLA2α, an enzyme that catalyzes the release of FAs from
phospholipids, was also increased in CLL cells compared with normal lymphocytes (Figure
5c). The expression of iPLA2α could also be further up-regulated by Perhexiline treatment
(Figure 5d). The expression of FASN in CLL cells and normal lymphocytes appeared similar
(Figure 5e), and Perhexiline incubation also led to an increase in FASN expression in all 3
CLL samples tested (Figure 5f). These data together suggest that CLL cells were highly
active in utilizing exogenous FAs through uptake via LPL and PLA2α for cardiolipin
synthesis, and that inhibition of FA transport by Perhexiline triggered a compensatory upregulation of LPL, PLA2α, and FASN.
In vivo therapeutic activity of Perhexiline in transgenic CLL mice

Author Manuscript

Since Perhexiline was able to effectively kill CLL cells in the presence of bone marrow
stromal cells, we postulated that this compound would be effective against CLL cells in
vivo. To test this possibility, we generated CLL transgenic mice with Tcl-1Tg:p53−/−
genotype 42 to evaluate the in vivo therapeutic activity of Perhexiline. Mice that had
developed CLL were first measured for basal leukemia cell burden in their peritoneal
cavities as described previously 6. After a week of recovery period, the mice were treated
with perhexiline (8 mg/kg, i.p.) every other day for a total of four injections. Peritoneal cells
were collected one week and two weeks after the last drug treatment to determine total cell
counts and CLL cell surface markers. As shown in Figure 6a–6b, there was a significant
decrease in leukemia cell counts in all mice after drug treatment (P<0.01). Importantly, flow
cytometry analysis of the cell for expression of CD5 and IgM revealed that 59% of the cells
were CD5+/IgM+ leukemia cells in the pre-treatment samples, whereas only 0.9% cells were
CD5+/IgM+ after drug treatment (Figure 6c), indicating that the leukemia cell population
(CD5+/IgM+ population) were selectively eliminated in vivo by Perhexiline, with most
(99%) of the remaining cells were CD5/IgM negative cells.

To evaluate the impact of Perhexiline treatment on the overall animal survival,
Tcl-1Tg:p53−/− mice that started to develop CLL at the age of approximately two months
were treated with Perhexiline (8 mg/kg, i.p.) every other day for a total of four injections.
The mice were then observed for survival time without further drug treatment. As shown in
Figure 6d, there was a significant increase in median survival time of the drug-treated mice
(5.0 months) compared to the untreated mice (3.8 months, P=0.0046). Considering that the
mice were treated with only 4 injections of Perhexiline as a single agent, these in vivo data
suggest that this drug might be potentially effective for clinical treatment of CLL.

Discussion
Among the many challenges in cancer treatment, development of drug resistance and low
therapeutic selectivity of cytotoxic anticancer agents are two major problems. The protective
effect of stromal microenvironment that promotes cancer cell survival and drug resistance
further contributes to the difficulty in elimination of cancer cells in vivo. Thus, identification
of new therapeutic strategies and novel compounds capable of effectively and selectively kill
cancer cells in stromal microenvironment would have significant clinical implications and
potentially improve the treatment outcome of cancer patients. One logical way to improve
therapeutic selectivity is to target the key biological differences between cancer cells and
normal cells. Metabolic alterations in cancer cells have emerge as a promising area that has
gained significant new insights into the biological differences between malignant and normal
cells, and provided new basis for selective targeting cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

In addition to increase in aerobic glycolysis known as Warburg effect,18 other metabolic
alterations including high dependency on glutamine and abnormal lipid metabolic pathways
are also observed in cancer cells. Inhibition of de novo FA synthesis by targeting FASN has
been considered as an attractive anticancer strategy.43,44 Deregulation of FA metabolism
seems to play an important role in CLL pathogenesis.29,31,33,41,43,45 In particular, increased
expression of LPL and PLA2 are often observed in CLL, and the high expression of LPL has
been considered as a poor prognosis factor.33 Since LPL and PLA2 facilitate the release of
FAs from lipoproteins and phospholipids for cellular utilization, it seems that CLL cells are
highly active in using exogenous lipids to meet their metabolic needs, although the exact
underlying reasons remain unclear.

Author Manuscript

In this study, we showed that inhibition of FAs transport into mitochondria by perhexiline
was able to effectively kill CLL cells, even when the leukemia cells were under the
protection by bone marrow stromal cells. This suggests that CLL cells are highly dependent
on the transport of FAs into mitochondria to maintain viability. Our study suggests that a key
role of mitochondrial FAs is to support the synthesis of cardiolipin as a critical component of
mitochondria membranes to maintain their integrity, and inhibition of FAs transport into the
mitochondria would lead to a severe depletion of cardiolipin and loss of mitochondrial
integrity, leading to a release of apoptotic factors and cell death. Importantly, such intrinsic
cell death process triggered within the mitochondria could not be rescued by stromal cells.

Author Manuscript

Although it is possible that the long-chain fatty acids transported into mitochondria could be
used as an energy source to generate ATP via β-oxidation to support CLL viability, it is
unlikely that this could be the key mechanism to maintain CLL cell survival, since the toxic
concentrations of perhexilin did not inhibit oxygen consumption, indicating that the FAs
transported into mitochondria were not used as a main fuel source. This conclusion is further
supported by the observation that inhibition of β-oxidation by high concentrations of
ranolazine only exhibited modest cytotoxic effect in CLL cells, suggesting that β-oxidation
of FAs might not be a critical energy source in primary CLL cells.

membranes, where it is required for maintaining the integrity of mitochondria. A loss of

cardiolipin may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Cardiolipin is also necessary for
cytochrome c anchorage to the mitochondrial membranes for proper function. Loss of
cardiolipin could arise from impaired cardiolipin synthesis due to a decrease in precursors
such FAs for its synthesis.46 Perhexiline, by its known ability to inhibit carnitine
palmitoyltransferases, suppresses the transport of FAs into mitochondria and thus depletes
the precursors for cardiolipin biosynthesis.

Author Manuscript

One important question is why inhibition of FA transport into mitochondria is selectively
toxic to CLL with low cytotoxicity to normal lymphocytes and stromal cells. A possible
explanation is that the turnover rate of cardiolipin in CLL cells may be higher than normal
cells, due to intrinsic oxidative stress in CLL cells and high expression of cardiolipin
degradation enzymes such as phospholipase iPLA2.47,48 The high intrinsic mitochondrial
ROS generation in CLL cells 6,12,24–26 might accelerate the degradation of cardiolipin,
which is highly sensitive to ROS-mediated damage and degradation.11,12 Thus, the high
turnover of cardiolipin in CLL cells would render them highly dependent on the transport of
FAs into mitochondria for cardiolipin synthesis. As such, CLL cells are more vulnerable to
inhibition of FA transport into mitochondria by perhexiline. This may also explain why CLL
cells often show elevated expression of LPL, which facilitates the uptake of exogenous FAs
for use in active synthesis of cardiolipin.

Author Manuscript

Our in vivo study showed that Perhexiline was able to effectively and selectively eliminate
CD5+/IgM+ leukemia cells in the CLL mouse model (Figure 6c). This is consistent with its
ability to selectively kill CLL cells in stromal tissue microenvironment. It is also important
to note that the CLL mice used in this study harbored Tcl-Tg:p53−/− genotype. Since a subset
of CLL patients with chromosome 17p-deletion (loss of p53 gene in 17p) are difficult to
treat due to drug resistance and aggressive disease progression. The ability of Perhexiline to
eliminate leukemia cells in the Tcl-Tg:p53−/− mice and to significantly prolong the mouse
survival by only 4 injections of the drug seems very promising. It should be noted that
Perhexiline is an anti-angina drug used since the 1970s and its clinical pharmacokinetic
parameters have been well characterized. This makes it feasible to reposition this drug for
new applications in CLL treatment. This possibility warrants further evaluation.

Author Manuscript

Bone marrow stromal cell lines (HS5, StromaNKtert, and KUSA-H1) were cultured as
described previously6, and were tested to be free of mycoplasma contamination. Blood
samples were obtained from CLL patients with confirmed diagnosis of CLL using the
National Cancer Institute Criteria.49 Proper informed consents under a research protocol
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of MD Anderson Cancer Center were
obtained from all patients before collection of blood samples. CLL cells were isolated from
blood samples as described previously.50 All viable samples were used in this study without

TEM imaging was carried out as previously described.51 Cell viability was determined by
double staining with annexin-V-FITC/PI followed by flow cytometry analysis as described
previously.6
Glucose uptake and oxygen consumption assays
CLL cells were first treated with 5 μM Perhexiline in triplicates for 3 h in glucose-free
medium. [3H]2-deoxyglucose (0.4 μCi/ml) was then added and incubated for 60 min. The
cells were collected, washed twice with PBS, and suspended in 200 μl of water, then mixed
with 1 ml scintillation fluid. Radioactivity was detected by scintillation countering. Cellular
oxygen consumption was measured by an Oxytherm system (Hansatech Instrument,
Norfolk, UK).
Quantitation of cardiolipin and mitochondrial membrane integrity

Author Manuscript

The cellular cardiolipin contents were measured by flow cytometry analysis, using NAO as a
specific fluorescence dye as described previously.40 Changes in mitochondrial membrane
potential were monitored by incubating cells with 1 μM Rho-123 for 1 h, followed by flow
cytometry.
Animal study

Author Manuscript

The Tcl-1Tg:p53−/− mouse model of CLL we recently established 42 was used to evaluate the
in vivo therapeutic effect of Perhexiline. Before drug treatment, leukemia cells were
obtained from the peritoneal cavity of Tcl-1Tg:p53−/− mice that had developed CLL disease
by peritoneal washing as described6, and the basal leukemia burden was measured. After a
week recovery period, the mice were treated with Perhexiline (8 mg/kg, i.p.) every other day
for 1 week (total 4 injections). Peritoneal cells were again collected one and two weeks after
the last drug treatment, and total cell counts as well as expression of surface IgM and CD5
were analyzed by flow cytometry as described.42 To evaluate animal survival, the mice (age
2 months) were treated with Perhexiline (8 mg/kg, i.p.) every other day for a total of 4
injections. The mice were then observed for survival without further drug treatment. The
mice with confirmed genotype (Tcl-1Tg:p53−/−) at age of 2 months were enrolled in this
study without exclusion, and randomly assigned to the control and treated groups with clear
label (no blinding). The animal study was performed in compliance with federal and
