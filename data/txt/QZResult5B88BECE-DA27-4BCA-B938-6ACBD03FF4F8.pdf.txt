Abstract
Mutational activation of KRAS is a common event in human tumors. Identification of the key signaling
pathways downstream of mutant KRAS is essential for our understanding of how to pharmacologically target these cancers in patients. We show that PD0325901, a small-molecule MEK inhibitor, decreases MEK/
ERK pathway signaling and destabilizes cyclin D1, resulting in significant anticancer activity in a subset of
KRAS mutant tumors in vitro and in vivo. Mutational activation of PIK3CA, which commonly co-occurs with
KRAS mutation, provides resistance to MEK inhibition through reactivation of AKT signaling. Genetic ablation of the mutant PIK3CA allele in MEK inhibitor–resistant cells restores MEK pathway sensitivity, and
re-expression of mutant PIK3CA reinstates the resistance, highlighting the importance of this mutation in
resistance to therapy in human cancers. In KRAS mutant tumors, PIK3CA mutation restores cyclin D1 expression and G1-S cell cycle progression so that they are no longer dependent on KRAS and MEK/ERK
signaling. Furthermore, the growth of KRAS mutant tumors with coexistent PIK3CA mutations in vivo is
profoundly inhibited with combined pharmacologic inhibition of MEK and AKT. These data suggest that
tumors with both KRAS and phosphoinositide 3-kinase mutations are unlikely to respond to the inhibition
of the MEK pathway alone but will require effective inhibition of both MEK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/
AKT pathway signaling. Cancer Res; 70(17); 6804–14. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The three members of the Ras family of small GTPase proteins, KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS, play central roles in the transduction of growth factor receptor–induced signals (1).
Mutations of RAS that impair its GTPase function are oncogenic and occur at high frequency in many human malignancies (2, 3). Activation of RAS has been implicated in mediating
many aspects of the transformed phenotype, including deregulated proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis.
The mechanisms through which RAS supports these
processes are not completely understood. In the activated,
GTP-bound state, RAS binds to and activates multiple effector
proteins of which more than 10 have been identified (4). Of
these, the most studied are the RAF kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) protein families and Ral guanine dissocia-

tion stimulator (5–8). Early work focused on the RAF family of
serine/threonine protein kinases. RAS-GTP binds to and activates the three RAF kinase family members which phosphorylate their main substrates, the serine/threonine kinases MEK1
and MEK2, which in turn activate the two ERK kinases (5, 9, 10).
ERK phosphorylates multiple substrates and has pleiotropic
cellular effects, including the induction of proliferation and invasion. This observation, the finding that ERK activation was
required for the transformation of NIH3T3 cells by mutant
RAS (11), the isolation of gag-RAF as a retroviral oncogene
(12), and the recent discovery that BRAF is mutated and oncogenic in a significant fraction of human tumors (13), led to the
idea that the RAF kinases and subsequent activation of MEK/
ERK signaling are key effectors of mutant KRAS-induced transformation. Therefore, pharmaceutical efforts have focused on
developing therapeutic agents that inhibit the components of
this KRAS effector pathway (14, 15). However, the ability to
pharmacologically and genetically block key KRAS effector
pathways unveiled unexpected complexities of KRAS signaling
in human cancer. Unlike the findings reported for BRAF mutant tumors (16, 17), many KRAS mutant tumor cells are resistant to MEK/ERK pathway inhibition. In fact, recent studies
in vitro and in vivo suggest that KRAS mutant tumors require
dual inhibition of both the MEK and PIK3CA pathways to
achieve inhibition of tumor growth (18–20).
Here, we use a selective, allosteric MEK inhibitor to determine the MEK dependence of tumors with mutational
activation of the pathway. These studies indicate that many
KRAS mutant tumor cell lines are, contrary to the prevailing

Mutant PIK3CA Abrogates Tumor Dependence on RAS and MEK/ERK

view, sensitive to the MEK inhibitor PD0325901, and hence,
dependent on the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling arm. Resistance
to MEK inhibitors in the relevant cell lines is not an intrinsic
feature of KRAS oncogenic function but instead mutational
activation of PIK3CA is present in most, but not all, MEKresistant KRAS mutant cancers. In such resistant lines,
sensitivity is restored by functional ablation of mutant PI3K
activity. Furthermore, our data show that combined inhibition
of both MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways in tumors with
both KRAS and PIK3CA mutations is effective in profoundly
inhibiting their growth in vivo. Overall, our data define genotypes that suggest which KRAS tumors may be effectively treated with MEK inhibition and support the possibility that MEK/
ERK inhibition, alone or in combination with inhibition of
PI3K/AKT signaling, might be effective therapeutic strategies
for mutant KRAS-dependent malignancy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human colon, pancreas, and lung cancer cell lines were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained as described in the Supplementary Methods. The MEK
inhibitor, PD0325901, was synthesized as described (21). The
dual AKT1/AKT2 inhibitor (AKTi-1/2) was obtained from
Merck and Co., Inc. (22–25). The PIK3CA isogenic HCT116
and DLD-1 cell lines have been previously described (26),
and were kindly provided by Drs. Bert Vogelstein and Victor
Velculescu (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD).
Cell proliferation assay and Western blot analysis were performed as previously described (17). Antibodies used for immunoblotting are listed in the Supplementary Methods.
Colony formation in soft agar
To assess anchorage-independent growth, triplicate samples of 1 × 104 cells were mixed in complete growth medium
containing 0.3% low-melting agarose and the indicated concentration of PD0325901. In a single well of a six-well plate,
2 mL of the cell mixture was plated on top of a 2-mL solidified
layer of 0.6% agarose containing growth medium. The agarose
was overlaid with 200 μL of complete medium. Cells were
stained with crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) and photographed
after 21 days using a dissecting microscope. Assays were done
in triplicate and in all cases, independently, at least twice.
Short interfering RNA experiments
ON-TARGETplus KRAS SMARTpool consisting of four
short interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes (L-005069, Dharmacon) was used for KRAS knockdown. Cells (3 × 105) were
plated in six-well plates and the next day transfected with
20 nmol/L of KRAS siRNA or a control nontargeting siRNA
no. 2 using DharmaFECT-1 transfection reagent and the accompanying protocol (Dharmacon).
Cell cycle analysis
Cells were seeded in six-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well) in
normal growth medium, and the following day, the cells were
treated with vehicle (DMSO), 50 nmol/L of PD0325901, or

www.aacrjournals.org

siRNA duplexes in the siRNA experiments. Both adherent
and floating cells were harvested. Nuclei were isolated by
the Nusse method, stained with ethidium bromide and analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry (27).
Generation of cells stably expressing mutant PIK3CA
HCT116 wild-type PIK3CA cell line stably expressing
mutant PI3K (H1047R) was generated by infection with
retroviruses carrying mutant PIK3CA-encoding gene
(pBabe-puro-HA-PIK3CA-H1047R, Addgene plasmid 12524;
ref. 28). Vector-only plasmid (pBabe-puro, Addgene plasmid
1764) was used as a control. The plasmids were transfected
into the GPG293 amphotropic packaging cell line using
LipofectAMINE transfection reagent to produce retrovirus.
GPG293 cells were provided by Dr. Joan Massague (Program
in Cancer Biology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,
New York, NY) and maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), doxycycline (20 ng/mL), puromycin (2 μg/mL),
and G418 (0.3 mg/mL). Virus was collected 72 hours posttransfection and filtered to remove cell contamination. Filtered retrovirus was used to infect cells in the presence of 8 mg/mL of
polybrene. After infection, successfully transduced polyclonal
cell populations were obtained by selection with puromycin
(2 μg/mL) as a pool of stable clones.
Animal studies
Animal experiments were carried out as previously described (16), under an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee–approved protocol, and institutional guidelines for the
proper, humane use of animals in research were followed.
PD0325901 was formulated in 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose plus 0.2% Tween 80 and administered by oral gavage for
5 consecutive days each week for 3 to 4 weeks. AKTi-1/2 was
formulated in 25% hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin (pH 4–5),
and administered subcutaneously. Additional details are provided in the Supplementary Methods.

Results
A subset of KRAS mutant cells depends on
MEK/ERK signaling
We first exposed a panel of 16 KRAS mutant colorectal,
lung, and pancreatic cancer cell lines to PD0325901, a potent
and selective MEK inhibitor, to ascertain their dependence
on MEK signaling for proliferation. At a concentration of
10 nmol/L, PD0325901 effectively inhibited MEK kinase signaling in all cells in the panel, as measured by loss of ERK
phosphorylation (p-ERK; Fig. 1B). In this panel, however,
MEK inhibition led to antiproliferative activity in seven of
these lines with IC 50 values of <20 nmol/L PD0325901
(Fig. 1A). Seven cell lines showed no antiproliferative
response to PD0325901 at concentrations >100 nmol/L
(Fig. 1A), and two cell lines had an intermediate phenotype
with IC50 values between 20 and 100 nmol/L. MEK dependence was not correlated with tumor lineage or the specific site
of KRAS mutation. On the other hand, the majority of MEKindependent cell lines harbored PIK3CA mutations, as previously reported (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1; refs. 29, 30).

Importantly, all the cell lines sensitive to MEK inhibition

In cells sensitive to MEK inhibition, expression of cyclin D1 was MEK-dependent. In MEK inhibitor–resistant
cells, cyclin D1 expression was unaffected even at
concentrations in vast excess of those required for inhibition of MEK activity (Fig. 1B). Thus, in a subset of
KRAS mutant tumor cells, MEK/ERK signaling is absolutely required for cyclin D1 expression and anchoragedependent proliferation.

Coexistent KRAS and PIK3CA mutations prevent cyclin
D degradation and sensitivity to MEK inhibition
We further characterized the biological outcome of MEK
antagonism in the above tumor cell lines. For example, in
KRAS mutant/PIK3CA wild-type cell lines (SW620 and
H747), MEK inhibition led to a rapid and persistent downregulation of cyclin D1 expression and arrest of the cells in the
G1 phase of the cell cycle (Figs. 1B, 2A, and B). In these cells,
MEK inhibition also resulted in an increase in apoptosis as
shown by an increase in cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase

(PARP) expression and a 4-fold increase in the fraction of the
cells with sub-G1 DNA content (Fig. 2A and B). As a result,
MEK inhibition with PD325901 prevented the anchorageindependent growth of KRAS mutant/PIK3CA wild-type cells
in soft agar (Fig. 2C). Notably, as little as 1 nmol/L of
PD0325901 was sufficient to inhibit colony formation by
>50% in these lines (Fig. 2C).
In contrast, upon MEK inhibition, KRAS mutant/PIK3CA
mutant cell lines (HCT-15 and DLD-1) exhibited neither cyclin D1 degradation, cell cycle arrest, nor induction of apoptosis (Fig. 2A and B). Again, these differences did not arise
due to a lack of ERK inhibition (Figs. 1B and 2A). Consistent
with this, anchorage-independent growth of these cells was
unaffected by up to 100 nmol/L of PD0325901 in soft agar
assays (Fig. 2C).
We next determined whether MEK/ERK signaling was required for the growth of KRAS mutant colorectal tumors
in vivo. To do this, we focused on two MEK-sensitive
(SW620, H747) and two MEK-insensitive (HCT-15 and DLD1) cell lines. PD0325901 (5 or 25 mg/kg) potently suppressed
the growth of KRAS mutant/PIK3CA wild-type, SW620, and
H747 xenografts (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S2B). As seen
in vitro, inhibition of tumor growth was associated with the
downregulation of p-ERK, cyclin D1, and cyclin D2 expression
and induction of cleaved PARP (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In
contrast, KRAS/PIK3CA-double mutant HCT-15 and DLD-1
xenograft tumors grew in the presence of MEK inhibition, albeit at a somewhat slower rate than the control (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S2B). In these tumors, no change in cyclin D
expression or induction of PARP cleavage was observed following PD0325901 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Thus,
cyclin D expression, PARP cleavage, anchorage-independent
in vitro growth, and in vivo growth of mutant KRAS colon tumor cells are not dependent on MEK/ERK signaling when
PIK3CA mutations are present. Together, these data help to
reconcile previously observed complexity regarding MEK inhibitor sensitivity in RAS mutant cancers (16, 18), and support
the notion that RAS mutation could predict sensitivity to MEK
inhibition, but that primary resistance could be observed
when RAS and PIK3CA mutations co-occur.
Selective knockout of mutant PIK3CA allele confers
MEK/ERK dependence
PIK3CA mutation could either be causal of MEK inhibitor
resistance or simply associated with the phenomenon. To determine whether mutant PIK3CA was sufficient to cause resistance to MEK inhibition, we used KRAS mutant colorectal
cancer cell lines that are isogenic with respect to PIK3CA
mutational status (26). Both HCT116 and DLD-1 harbor heterozygous G13D KRAS mutations and are also heterozygous
for H1047R or E545K PIK3CA mutations, respectively. Homologous recombination was used by Samuels and colleagues to knock out either the mutant or wild-type allele of
PIK3CA in these cell lines, thus creating pairs of KRAS mutant
cell lines that are isogenic except with respect to their endogenous PIK3CA mutational status (26). Both HCT116 and
DLD-1 cell lines with mutant PIK3CA were insensitive to
PD0325901, as expected from the results above (Fig. 3A; Sup-

plementary Fig. S3). In contrast, knockout of mutant PIK3CA
in the paired cell lines conferred sensitivity to MEK inhibition. This sensitivity correlated with the induction of
apoptotic markers such as an increase in the sub-G1 fraction of cells and induction of PARP cleavage and caspase-3
activation (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S3B). As expected
from the original description of these lines, the effects of
MEK inhibition were more pronounced in 1% of FBS
(Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S3). Importantly, in an in vivo
setting, we further showed that loss of the mutant PIK3CA
allele was sufficient to confer sensitivity to PD0325901
when HCT116 cells were grown as xenografts (Fig. 4). Specifically, the growth of PIK3CA mutant tumors was only
marginally affected by treatment with the MEK inhibitor.
The growth of the tumor xenografts with wild-type PIK3CA
tumors, however, was dramatically suppressed by MEK
inhibition (Fig. 4A). Similarly to in vitro data, in these
PIK3CA wild-type xenografts, MEK inhibition caused a
significant induction of cleaved PARP expression and
caspase-3 activation (Fig. 4B and C). Formally, it is possible that selection for PIK3CA wild-type isogenic clones had
coselected for other background mutations that could
confound these findings. To confirm that restored MEK
dependence in these lines was specifically due to genetic
knockout of mutant PIK3CA, we exogenously re-expressed
the mutant PIK3CA gene into the HCT116 wild-type PIK3CA
cells and tested their dependence on MER/ERK signaling.
Stable transfection of H1074R mutant PIK3CA into these
cells restored resistance to MEK inhibition and prevented
PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activation (Fig. 3C). Together,
these results strongly suggest that mutant PIK3CA is
necessary for the MEK-independent growth of mutant
KRAS colon cancers in tissue culture and in vivo, and
is consistent with studies using shRNA and PIK3CA
inhibitors (18, 19).
Sustained cyclin D expression and bypass of MEK
inhibitor–induced G1 arrest correlates with
MEK antagonist efficacy
It is important to note that PI3K mutation, while inducing
proliferative and apoptotic resistance to MEK inhibition, did
not alter the activity of ERK. Thus, there might be PI3K pathway intersecting effector molecules further downstream of
ERK. Our observation that cyclin D1 regulation correlates with
MEK sensitivity, further supported by the work of Smalley and
colleagues (31), which shows that increased cyclin D1 expression could mediate BRAF inhibitor resistance in BRAF mutant
melanomas, led us to further explore whether cyclin D1 might
be a candidate for one such downstream effector molecule.
First, we transfected multiple cell lines with KRAS siRNA to
determine whether MEK-dependent cyclin D1 expression
was also dependent on the expression of KRAS. KRAS siRNA
effectively reduced KRAS expression, resulting in marked inhibition of p-ERK (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S4A). In MEKdependent cell lines, KRAS knockdown also resulted in a
>90% decrease in AKT phosphorylation on S473 (p-AKT;
Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S4A). In these cells, KRAS knockdown resulted in a >90% decrease in cyclin D1 expression, an

these cells only slightly altered the fraction of cells in G1 (an
average increase from 55% to 60%) or S phase (an average
decrease from 38% to 33%; Fig. 5B). Together, these data
suggest that whereas cyclin D1 expression and G1-S cell cycle
progression are dependent on KRAS and MEK/ERK signaling,
mutation of PIK3CA relieves this dependence.

To confirm that cyclin D1 expression and cell cycle progression is dependent on mutant PIK3CA in MEK-independent cell
lines, we used the PIK3CA isogenic cell pairs in HCT116 to further explore this relationship. As expected, KRAS knockdown
in cells lacking the mutant PIK3CA allele caused, in addition to
downregulation of ERK phosphorylation, a marked downregulation of AKT phosphorylation and cyclin D1 expression

these cells accumulated in G1 (from 45% to 81%; Fig. 5D)
with a concomitant loss of cells in S phase (from 36% to
9%; Supplementary Fig. S4C). In contrast, potent KRAS
knockdown with siRNA did not alter AKT phosphorylation
or the expression of cyclin D1 and had only a marginal

effect on cell cycle distribution in HCT116 cells bearing
mutant PIK3CA (Fig. 5C and D; Supplementary Fig. S4C).
This strongly suggests that resistance to MEK inhibition
and diminished requirement for KRAS in KRAS mutant
cells directly correlates with persistent activation of a
PI3K/AKT signaling axis.

Combined inhibition of both MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT
pathways suppresses the growth of tumors with
coexisting KRAS and PIK3CA mutations
Genetic ablation of PIK3CA mutation is sufficient to restore
sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in KRAS/PIK3CA mutant cell
lines. This implies that pharmacologic inhibition of the
PI3K/AKT signaling axis might have similar effects. To explore
this further, a potent and selective inhibitor of AKT1 and AKT2
(AKTi-1/2; refs. 22–25) was used to block signaling downstream of mutant PIK3CA. Mice bearing KRAS/PIK3CA mutant
HCT15 tumor xenografts were treated with the MEK inhibitor
PD0325901 and AKTi-1/2 alone or in combination. Daily treatments with either 5 mg/kg of PD0325901 or 100 mg/kg of AKTi1/2 as single agents showed no significant effects on tumor
growth. However, when both inhibitors were administered in
combination, the growth of tumor xenografts was profoundly
abrogated (Fig. 6A). Chronic administration of both drugs together was well tolerated (Supplementary Fig. S5). In mice
treated with either inhibitor alone, the expected pathway inhibitory effect was achieved, as evident by downregulation of
p-ERK with PD0325901 and p-AKT with AKTi-1/2 (Fig. 6B).

Neither agent alone resulted in elevated apoptosis, as judged
by cleaved PARP. However, the dual inhibition of MEK and
AKT signaling with both inhibitors cooperated to induce a
profound accumulation of cleaved PARP, suggesting that the
combination therapy induced apoptosis (Fig. 6B). Using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling
staining (32) as an alternate measure of apoptosis, significant
staining of xenograft tissue was only seen in the presence of
both inhibitors (Fig. 6C). Consistent with experiments using
genetic ablation of mutant PIK3CA signaling, these data indicate that the concurrent pharmacologic inhibition of both the
PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways is an effective strategy to
overcome the resistance to inhibiting either pathway alone in
cancer cells bearing both KRAS and PIK3CA mutant alleles.

Discussion
Oncogenic activation of RAS isoforms by mutation is a highly
recurrent phenomenon in human tumors. Although mutant
RAS is an attractive target for therapy, efforts to develop pharmacologic inhibitors have thus far been unsuccessful. This has

Figure 6. Combined inhibition of both MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways shows benefits in suppressing the growth of tumors with coexisting KRAS and
PIK3CA mutations. A, mice with established HCT15 (KRAS mutant/PIK3CA mutant) xenografts were dosed with 5 mg/kg of PD0325901 and 100 mg/kg
of AKTi-1/2 alone or in combination. The results are represented as in Fig. 2D. B and C, immunoblots of homogenized xenograft tissue. Tumors were
excised 8 h posttreatment and split in half: one half was flash-frozen for immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies (B); the other half was
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and used for analysis (C) by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling assay [described in
Gavrieli and colleagues (32)].

Mutant PIK3CA Abrogates Tumor Dependence on RAS and MEK/ERK

led to efforts focused on inhibiting KRAS-dependent transformation by targeting downstream effector pathways. Although
more than 10 families of RAS effector proteins have been identified (4), there is strong evidence that at least three of these, the
RAF, PI3K, and the RAL exchange factors, play predominant
roles in mediating its transforming effects (5–8). This suggests
that multiple effector pathways downstream of RAS must be
blocked to achieve a therapeutic effect. Indeed, recent research
has identified that dual inhibition of both the MEK (downstream of RAF) and PI3K kinase effector pathways is essential
to cause the regression of genetically engineered KRAS mutant
tumors in mice (18). However, in human cancer cell lines, our
results show that at least a subset of KRAS mutant tumors, particularly those wild-type for PIK3CA, retain sensitivity to MEK
inhibition as a monotherapy, consistent with another recent report (19). We observe that KRAS mutant and PIK3CA wild-type
cancer cells show a decrease in both p-ERK and p-AKT signaling as well as growth inhibition through cyclin D1 degradation
and G1 arrest in vitro and in vivo. In human cancers, the situation will undoubtedly be more complex, and the question
remains: how can MEK inhibitor–sensitive and –resistant tumors be identified in patient populations? Our results indicate
that p-ERK is a poor biomarker on its own. Because both mutant KRAS and PIK3CA signaling may converge on cyclin D1
stability and G1-S cell cycle transition, the rapid and persistent
loss of cyclin D1 could be an important biomarker for the efficacy of MEK inhibition in cancers, a notion consistent with a
recent publication which showed that increased cyclin D1 expression could mediate BRAF inhibitor resistance (31).
It is important to note that although all identified MEK
inhibitor–sensitive cancer cells were KRAS mutant/PIK3CA
wild-type, not all KRAS mutant/PIK3CA wild-type cancer
cells were MEK inhibitor–sensitive. Interestingly, the downstream signaling features present in PIK3CA mutant tumors
(e.g., stabilized cyclin D1 expression) are retained in these
inhibitor-resistant cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that as-yetunidentified genetic lesions that generate MEK resistance
in KRAS mutant tumors remain to be discovered. For
example, SW1990 and H2030 cells, despite having wild-type
PIK3CA and PTEN, have augmented PIK3CA/AKT pathway
activation, as evident by higher expression of phosphorylated
AKT in these cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). This upregulation of AKT pathway signaling could possibly be due to mutations in other elements of PIK3CA signaling (33–35) and
might be the basis for resistance in MEK inhibitor–insensitive
PIK3CA/PTEN wild-type cell lines such as SW1990 and H2030.
However, because p-AKT levels do not seem to be predictive
of resistance across all the cell lines, PIK3CA mutation remains the strongest predictor. Alternatively, it is also plausible that common downstream effectors of KRAS and PIK3CA
which serve as integrators of signaling could also be mutated.
Identification of these mutations and downstream signaling
pathways will undoubtedly aid in our understanding of the
common signaling pathways upon which KRAS and PIK3CA
converge.
There is currently no therapeutic agent that directly inhibits KRAS function. The results reported here have important
implications for the development of treatments for tumors

www.aacrjournals.org

with mutant RAS. Inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling may be
useful in some of these patients as a single modality. However, only tumors with a wild-type PIK3CA pathway would be
likely to respond to MEK/ERK inhibition alone. In early trials
of MEK inhibitors, clinical responses were noted in a patient
with pancreatic cancer and in a patient with mutant NRAS
melanoma, suggesting that in some cases, MEK inhibition
could indeed have single-agent efficacy in humans (36–38).
However, our results suggest that patients with coexistent
PIK3CA pathway mutations should be excluded from such
trials. Instead, our data with in vivo xenograft models suggest
that patients with such tumors would require combined inhibition of both the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways to
observe efficacy. Because the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/
AKT pathways are two key RAS effector pathways, the combined inhibition of MEK and AKT might constitute a general
“anti-RAS” therapeutic strategy. Regardless of PIK3CA mutational status, this strategy could be useful in cancers with
mutated RAS (pancreatic, colon, lung carcinoma) for which
there are few and only marginally effective therapies. The tolerability of the combined inhibition of AKT and MEK and its
marked effects on reducing tumor growth in mouse models
suggest that such a strategy could be useful in a variety of
advanced tumors bearing both RAS and PIK3CA mutations.
Why do tumors mutate multiple oncogenes that seem to
converge on similar downstream signaling events? We speculate that part of the selection for the second mutation is to
reduce a cell's dependency on any one pathway and provide
redundancy to reduce oncogene addiction, perhaps in the
face of environmental cues such as hypoxia or low nutrient
conditions that attenuate tumor growth. The downstream
convergence of PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling might account
for the significant frequency of coexistent mutations in these
pathways in cancer. In fact, the requirement for combined
inhibition suggests that the two pathways activate converging targets that integrate their function. These integrators,
for example, may include components of the networks that
regulate cellular survival and apoptosis (39), protein translation (40), or cell cycle (such as cyclin D1).
