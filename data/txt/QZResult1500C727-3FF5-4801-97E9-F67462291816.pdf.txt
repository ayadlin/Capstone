Abstract
Mismatch repair (MMR) strongly enhances cyto- and genotoxicity of several chemotherapeutic agents and environmental
carcinogens. DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) formed after
two replication cycles play a major role in MMR-dependent
cell death by DNA alkylating drugs. Here, we examined DNA
damage detection and the mechanisms of the unusually rapid
induction of DSB by MMR proteins in response to carcinogenic chromium(VI). We found that MSH2-MSH6 (MutSA)
dimer effectively bound DNA probes containing ascorbate-CrDNA and cysteine-Cr-DNA cross-links. Binary Cr-DNA adducts,
the most abundant form of Cr-DNA damage, were poor
substrates for MSH2-MSH6, and their toxicity in cells was
weak and MMR independent. Although not involved in the
initial recognition of Cr-DNA damage, MSH2-MSH3 (MutSB)
complex was essential for the induction of DSB, micronuclei,
and apoptosis in human cells by chromate. In situ fractionation of Cr-treated cells revealed MSH6 and MSH3 chromatin
foci that originated in late S phase and did not require
replication of damaged DNA. Formation of MSH3 foci was
MSH6 and MLH1 dependent, whereas MSH6 foci were
unaffected by MSH3 status. DSB production was associated
with progression of cells from S into G2 phase and was
completely blocked by the DNA synthesis inhibitor aphidicolin. Interestingly, chromosome 3 transfer into MSH3-null
HCT116 cells activated an alternative, MSH3-like activity that
restored dinucleotide repeat stability and sensitivity to
chromate. Thus, sequential recruitment and unprecedented
cooperation of MutSA and MutSB branches of MMR in
processing of Cr-DNA cross-links is the main cause of DSB
and chromosomal breakage at low and moderate Cr(VI) doses.

Introduction
The primary function of mismatch repair (MMR) is to correct
errors arising during DNA replication (1, 2). Detection of single
base mispairs occurs through the binding of the MutSa complex
(MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer; refs. 3, 4), which is also capable of
recognizing one nucleotide insertion/deletion (4). The lessabundant MutSh heterodimer (MSH2-MSH3) predominantly

recognizes insertion/deletion loops containing two or more
nucleotides (3, 4). After recognition and binding to mispaired
DNA, MutSa/h recruits MutLa (MLH1-PMS2 heterodimer), and
the MutS-MutL complex activates the excision of up to 1 kb of
newly synthesized DNA to remove the mispairs (1, 2). Loss of
MMR leads to highly elevated rates of spontaneous mutagenesis
and is a cause of microsatellite instability found in 15% to 20% of
human cancers (5). In addition to their role in correction of
replication errors, MMR proteins are known to participate in the
cytotoxic responses to several chemotherapeutic drugs including
SN1-type methylating agents (6, 7), cisplatin (8, 9), and halogenated
nucleotides (10–12). The activation of cell death by these drugs
involved the initial recognition of modified DNA bases by MutSa
and a subsequent recruitment of MutLa. MutSh has not been
found to play any significant role in toxicity of alkylating agents or
base analogues (13, 14). MMR-dependent processing of DNA
damage leads to a delayed formation of DNA double-strand breaks
(DSB) and these secondary lesions are important for apoptosis,
cell cycle arrest, and cytogenetic damage (15–17). Direct signaling
from DNA damage–bound MMR complexes has been proposed as
an alternative model for the induction of cell death (5, 18, 19).
Another chemical that displays a MMR-dependent mechanism
of cell death is the potent human carcinogen chromium(VI) (20,
21). Cr(VI) is a procarcinogen activated via reduction to Cr(III) by
cellular ascorbate (Asc) and small thiols (22), which results in the
formation of weakly mutagenic Cr-DNA adducts and strongly
mutagenic reducer-Cr-DNA cross-links (22–25). The importance of
MMR in Cr(VI) carcinogenesis is indicated by a very high frequency
(>80%) of microsatellite instability in chromate-induced human
lung carcinomas (26, 27), suggested to result from selective
outgrowth of resistant cells during chronic exposures to Cr(VI)
(refs. 20, 28). Mechanistically, MMR seems to induce cell death in
response to Cr-DNA damage differently than in the cases of other
DNA-damaging agents. The initiation of apoptosis by MMR of
Cr-treated cells was preceded by the formation of poorly repaired
DSB that were induced almost immediately after Cr(VI) exposure
(20, 29). This rapid DSB production is inconsistent with the model
of futile MMR cycling in which DSB are not formed until the
second S phase after a generation of single-strand breaks and gaps
in the daughter DNA strand after the first S phase (15–17). Thus,
in addition to the importance of mechanistic understanding of
high genotoxicity of this widespread carcinogen, Cr(VI) can also
serve as a tool to uncover novel functions of MMR proteins in
responses to DNA damage.
In this work, we identified ternary Cr-DNA cross-links as high
affinity substrates for recognition by MSH2-MSH6 dimer. Using an
in situ fractionation approach and selective knockdowns of MMR
proteins, we discovered the formation of MSH6 and MSH3 nuclear
foci and a unique requirement for the MutSh complex in induction
of DSB and apoptosis by Cr(VI).

Materials and Methods
Cells and treatments. Human colon HCT116 (MLH1 / ) and DLD1
(MSH6 / ), lung epithelial H460, and lung fibroblast IMR90 cell lines were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). HCT116+chr.3
(MLH1+) and DLD1+chr.2 (MSH6+) were gifts from Dr. T. Kunkel (NIH/
NIEHS, Research Triangle Park, NC). Loading with Asc and measurements
of its cellular concentrations by high performance liquid chromatography
were performed as previously described (29, 30). Exposures to K2CrO4
[Cr(VI)] were for 3 h in serum-free medium. For clonogenic experiments,
colonies were stained with Giemsa solution and counted 10 to 14 d later.
Cr-DNA modifications. Cr-DNA adducts were formed according to the
previously described conditions (24, 25). Binary Cr-DNA adducts were
generated by reacting 2 Ag DNA with 0 to 80 Amol/L CrCl3.6H2O in
25 mmol/L MES buffer (pH 6.0). Standard reaction mixtures for Cr-DNA
binding during Cr(VI) reduction contained 2 Ag DNA, 25 mmol/L MOPS
(pH 7.0), 0 to 150 Amol/L K2CrO4, and either 1 mmol/L Asc or 2 mmol/L
cysteine. Reactions were incubated at 37jC for 30 min (CrCl3 and Asc
reactions) or 1 h (cysteine reactions). Unreacted Cr was removed by two
passages through Bio-Gel P-30 (plasmids) or P-6 (oligos) columns. DNAbound Cr was measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (30).
DNA-protein pulldown assay. Nuclear extracts were prepared as
described (31) with the addition of a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)
to the lysis buffer. The sense oligo, 5¶-GGGAAGCTGCCAGGCCCCAGTGTCAGCCTCCTATGCTC, was modified with a 5¶biotin label. The antisense
sequence for the homoduplex contained normal Watson-Crick base pairing
and antisense sequence for the heteroduplex probe contained one G/T
mispair in the center of the sequence, 5¶-GAGCATAGGAGGCTGACATTGGGGCCTGGCAGCTTCCC. Nuclear extracts (100 Ag) were preincubated with 0.1 Ag of nonbiotinylated homoduplex and 5 Ag poly DI:DC in 1
DNA binding buffer [12% glycerol, 20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mmol/L
KCl, 1 mmol/L DTT, 5 mmol/L MgCl2] for 5 min at 4jC. Next, 100 ng
biotinylated duplex were added to the reaction for 30 min. Biotin-DNAprotein complexes were captured by incubation with 80 AL streptavidinagarose beads for 2 h at 4jC. Beads were washed 4 times with 1 mL of
1 DNA binding buffer, resuspended in 30 AL of 2 SDS loading buffer
and bound proteins were released by boiling.
Western blotting. Cells were collected by scraping, washed twice with
cold PBS and then resuspended in a lysis buffer supplemented with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (20). Proteins were separated by SDSPAGE and electrotransferred onto ImmunoBlot polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes. Primary antibodies for MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 were
from Pharmingen. Protein bands were visualized using horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies.
Plasmid replication in cells. Control and Cr-modified pSP189 plasmids
(M. Seidman, NIH/NIA, Baltimore, MD) were transfected into HCT116 and
HCT116+chr.3 and allowed to replicate for 48 h. The replicated plasmids
were isolated by the Mini-prep kit from Qiagen. DNA was ethanol
precipitated, dissolved in deionized water, and electroporated into
Escherichia coli MBL50 strain. Transformed E. coli cells were plated on
minimal agar plates containing 30 Ag/mL of ampicillin and 0.5 Ag/mL of
chloramphenicol to assess the yield of replicated plasmids.
Knockdown experiments. Stable depletion of protein levels was
achieved by expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) from the pSUPERRETRO vector. The plasmid was linearized with HindIII and BglII to
permit the insertion of the annealed oligonucleotides directed toward
the mRNA of interest. The targeting vectors for MSH2, luciferase (29),
MLH1 (32), and infection conditions (33) have already been described.
MSH6- and MSH3-targeting vectors were constructed using 5¶-gatccccggtgatccctctgagaactttcaagagaagttctcagagggatcacctttttggaaa and 5¶-gatccccgccagtttgtgaactagaattcaagagattctagttcacaaactggctttttggaaa oligos,
respectively. Vector-expressing cells were selected in the presence of
1.5 Ag/mL puromycin.
MLH1 complementation. MluI fragment caring MLH1 gene was excised
from pCMV-SPORT6 (ATCC) and inserted into the pQCXIN retroviral vector
opened with EcoRI. Viral particles were packaged in 293T cells by

passages) and then selected with 2 Ag/mL puromycin at a density of 1  106
cells per 100-mm dish. Mutation frequency was calculated by dividing the
number of puromycin resistant colonies per 106 clonable cells.

Results
MSH2-MSH6 dimer recognizes Cr-DNA cross-links in vitro.
To examine whether MMR proteins are able to recognize Cr-DNA

damage, we devised a DNA-protein pulldown assay. Biotinylated
oligos were incubated with nuclear extracts, pulled down with
streptavidin beads, and bound proteins were eluted and analyzed
by immunoblotting. Validation experiments confirmed the ability
of biotinylated DNA containing a single G/T mismatch to pull
down both MSH2 and MSH6 from HeLa extracts (Fig. 1A). Cr-DNA
binding does not display apparent base or sequence specificity
leading to a near random distribution of adducts (23, 35). As
adjacent bases exert strong effects on the ability of MMR
complexes to bind their substrates (19, 36), analysis of randomly
damaged templates offers a benefit of examining multiple sequence
contexts. In our initial experiments, we monitored binding of
MSH2, a component of both MutSa and MutSh mismatch-sensing
complexes. Oligos containing solely binary Cr-DNA adducts
showed reproducible binding of MSH2 but only at a high density
of modifications (f7 Cr/oligo; Fig. 1B). However, DNA probes
modified in the presence of Cr(VI)-cysteine displayed a strong
binding of MSH2 at 2.7 Cr/oligo. Oligos modified in the reaction of
Cr(VI) with its dominant cellular reducer Asc pulled down MSH2 at
both 1.3 and 3.2 Cr/probe (Fig. 1B). We have previously determined
that Cr(VI)-cysteine reactions generated approximately equal
numbers of Cr-DNA adducts and cysteine-Cr-DNA cross-links
(37). Cr(VI)-Asc reactions yielded f25% Asc-Cr-DNA cross-links
and 75% Cr-DNA adducts (30).
We next examined the role of MSH2-MSH6 and MSH2-MSH3
complexes in recognition of Cr-DNA adducts. Oligos modified
during Cr(VI) reduction with cysteine or Asc pulled down MSH6

from HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig. 1C). We were unable to detect the
presence of MSH3 in HeLa pulldowns (data not shown). To further
test a potential involvement of MSH3, we analyzed DNA adduct–
binding activity of nuclear extracts from DLD1 (MSH6 ) and
DLD1+chr.2 (MSH6+) cells. Although MSH2 was pulled down by
Cr-DNA damage from MSH6+ extracts, there was no MSH2 binding
in MSH6 extracts (Fig. 1C). Similarly to detection of base
mismatches, recognition of Cr-DNA damage by MutSa was
independent of MLH1 as nuclear extracts from MLH1-null
HCT116 cells showed normal binding of MSH2 to Cr/Asc-modified
DNA probes (Fig. 1C). Because lack of MLH1 makes cells resistant
to Cr(VI) cytotoxicity (20, 21), this protein seems to act in the
genotoxic responses downstream of MutSa-mediated recognition
of Cr-DNA adducts. To test whether the differences in binding by
MSH2-MSH6 accurately predict genotoxic responses in cells, we
examined replication inhibition by Cr-DNA modifications at levels
equivalent to 0.8 to 2.2 Cr/pulldown oligo. In agreement with

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (3). February 1, 2009

MutSa binding affinity, plasmids treated with Cr(VI)+Asc but not
with Cr(III) displayed a strong MMR-dependent replication
inhibition (Fig. 1D).
Both MutS dimers are required for the induction of cell
death by Cr-DNA damage. To test the importance of MMR
complexes in cellular responses to Cr(VI), we created stable

shRNA-mediated depletions of MLH1, MSH3, and MSH6 were
highly specific, whereas knockdown of MSH2 was also accompanied by decreased stability of its partners MSH3 and MSH6.
Surprisingly, loss of MSH3 suppressed clonogenic lethality of
Cr(VI) to the same degree as did loss of MSH6, MSH2, or MLH1
(Fig. 2B). The same result was observed in cells supplemented
with physiologic 1 mmol/L Asc, the most important Cr(VI)
reducer in vivo (22) with barely detectable concentrations in
H460 (21) and other cultured human cells (29, 30). Potentiating
effects of Asc on Cr(VI) toxicity are completely blocked by MMR

Cooperation of MSH6 and MSH3 in DNA Breakage

inactivation (21, 29), which makes preloading of cells with this
vitamin a very useful tool for a selective enhancement of the
MMR-dependent toxic responses. Silencing of MSH3 or other
MMR proteins all inhibited Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis as
evidenced by decreased PARP cleavage (Fig. 2C). MSH3 depletion
had no effect on clonogenic lethality of two chemicals with
MSH6- but not MSH3-dependent toxicity (13, 14), N-methyl-N ’nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and 6-thioguanine (Fig. 2D), demonstrating that the involvement of MSH3 in MMR-activated cell
death was specific to Cr-DNA damage. Stable knockdowns of
MSH3 and MSH6 in primary lung IMR90 fibroblasts were also
equivalent in suppression of all Cr(VI)-induced cytotoxic effects
(data not shown).
Both MSH6 and MSH3 are involved in DSB formation. The
inhibition of all forms of cytotoxicity by silencing of MSH3 or MSH6
suggested that both proteins acted very early in toxic processing of
Cr-DNA damage. Therefore, we examined the role of MSH6 and
MSH3 in the generation of a DSB-specific marker gH2AX foci (38)
that appear early after Cr-DNA damage and precede the activation
of apoptotic responses (20, 29). We found that knockdowns of
MSH3, MSH6, or MLH1 all abrogated the formation of gH2AX foci
in Cr(VI)-treated IMR90 cells (Fig. 3A). As expected, supplementation of IMR90 cells with 1 mmol/L Asc strongly enhanced the
production of gH2AX foci by Cr(VI) but silencing of MSH3 or
MSH6 eliminated the induction of this DSB marker. Knockdown of
MSH3 or MSH6 also completely suppressed the formation of
micronuclei by 0.5 and 1 Amol/L Cr(VI; Fig. 3B), indicating that
processing of Cr-DNA damage by MutS dimers was responsible for
chromosomal breakage by doses below the current US-EPA water
standard of 100 ppb (1.92 Amol/L) chromium. PFGE further
confirmed that both MSH6 and MSH3 were required for DSB
induction by Cr(VI; Fig. 3C).
To investigate whether MMR proteins were present at the sites of
DNA breaks, we examined the colocalization of MSH3 and MSH6
with gH2AX foci. After testing several different extraction
conditions, we found that permeabilization in the CSK buffer
before paraformaldehyde fixation was effective in removal of
nucleoplasmic MMR proteins and it also revealed the formation of
MSH3 and MSH6 foci in Cr(VI)-treated but not control IMR90 cells
(Fig. 3D). Approximately 30% to 40% of gH2AX foci-containing cells
showed colocalization with MSH3 foci. The frequency of gH2AX
foci–positive cells displaying colocalization with MSH6 foci
averaged 85% to 90%. We also found a high degree of colocalizaion
of MSH6 foci with 53BP1 foci (data not shown), another marker of
DSB (39). The colocalization of MSH3 and MSH6 to DSB foci
further supports a causal role of both proteins in breakage of
Cr-adducted DNA.
Dependence of MSH3 and MSH6 foci on other MMR
proteins. Consistent with its lack of participation in recognition
of Cr-DNA damage by MutSa in pulldown experiments, MSH3
depletion had no significant effect on the formation of MSH6 foci
in Cr-treated IMR90 cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, MSH6 was
absolutely required for the production of MSH3 foci in Cr(VI)treated cells (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that MutSa complex is
involved in the initial detection of Cr-DNA damage in cells and
MSH3-containing MutSh complex is recruited later. The majority
of MSH6 foci-containing cells also had MSH3 foci and vice versa.
For example, 80.9% of MSH6 foci+ cells contained MSH3 foci and
90.4% of MSH3 foci+ cells had MSH6 foci at 6 hours after 10 Amol/L
Cr exposure of 1 mmol/L Asc-preloaded IMR90 cells. MLH1
depletion in primary IMR90 cells resulted in a moderately lower

frequency of MSH6 foci-containing cells (Fig. 4C) and completely
abrogated MSH3 foci (Fig. 4D).
Cell cycle specificity and effect of replication on MSH3 and
MSH6 foci. Because the majority of Cr-induced DSB are found in
G2 cells (20, 29), we asked whether the formation of MMR foci also
exhibits cell cycle specificity. S phase cells were labeled by BrdUrd
incorporation, whereas G2 cells were identified by cyclin B1
staining. Our detergent extraction procedure retained cytoplasmic
cyclin B1 due to the stability of its binding to microtubules (40).
Essentially no cells displayed both BrdUrd incorporation and
MSH6/MSH3 foci either immediately or 6 hours after Cr(VI)
exposure (Fig. 5A). A large percentage of cells containing MSH6

The role of replication in the formation of MMR foci was
examined in two series of experiments with the DNA polymerase
inhibitor aphidicolin. In the first set, there was no replication of
Cr-adducted DNA at any time due the presence of aphidicolin
during and after Cr(VI) treatments. In the second set, replication
was only inhibited during Cr exposure and then the aphidicolin

block was removed. We found that even in the absence of any
replication, Cr-DNA damage resulted in a significant formation of
MSH6 and MSH3 foci immediately after Cr(VI) exposure and their
levels remained constant during 4 hours post-Cr incubations (Fig.
5C). Release of the replication block after Cr exposure resulted in a
progressively higher number of MSH6/3 foci–containing cells with
time and a parallel increase in the number of MMR foci/cyclin
B1–double positive cells (Fig. 5C). Unlike MSH6/3 foci, replication
arrest by aphidicolin completely blocked the formation of DSB
(Fig. 5D), pointing to the importance of the completion of
DNA replication and progression from S into G2 for DNA breakage
by MMR.
Different responses in HCT116 cells expressing MLH1 via
vector or chromosome 3 complementation. We have previously
found that MLH1-null HCT116 cells had much greater resistance to
Cr(VI) and lower DSB induction than their counterparts complemented with MLH1 via chromosome 3 transfer (20). However,
HCT116 cells have also been reported to lack functional MSH3 due
to a 1 truncation mutation in the (A)8 repeat of exon 7 (41). This
raised the important question of how chromosome 3 transfer
increased sensitivity of HCT116 cells to Cr(VI) because MSH3 was
clearly required for Cr-induced cytotoxicity and DSB production in
IMR90 and H460 cells. Formation and repair of Cr-DNA adducts
were identical in HCT116 and HCT116+chr.3 cells (20), excluding
the possibility that chromosome complementation altered Cr(VI)
metabolism or persistence of adducts. We sequenced exon 7 of
MSH3 gene from our HCT116 lines and confirmed the presence of
the previously reported truncation mutation in the (A)8 repeat.
MLH1 silencing in HCT116+chr.3 cells restored their resistance to
Cr(VI) (Fig. 6A), confirming MMR-dependence of cell death in Crtreated HCT116+chr.3 cells. Because chromosome 3 introduced
more genes than just MLH1, we infected HCT116 cells with the
pQCXIN-MLH1 retroviral vector and selected several clones that
expressed MLH1 at the same level as HCT116+chr.3 cells. As
expected, expression of functional MLH1 in HCT116 cells was
accompanied by stabilization of its partner PMS2 (Fig. 6B).
Although all MLH1-expressing clones were highly sensitive to
MNNG, a chemical that induces MMR-dependent toxicity without
MSH3 involvement (14), they showed no sensitization to Cr(VI)
(Fig. 6C). Because repair of 2 nt-long insertion/deletion loops is
primarily dependent on MSH2-MSH3 dimer (41, 42), MLH1complemented HCT116 cells containing only MutSa complex
would be expected to display a weak suppression of frameshift
mutagenesis at dinucleotide repeats. We found that two tested
clones complemented with pQCXIN-MLH1 showed only modest

Cooperation of MSH6 and MSH3 in DNA Breakage

surviving in the presence of 2 Ag/mL puromycin. Total of 5 to 7  107 clonable cells were screened for puromycin resistance. Similar mutation frequencies were obtained
when selection was performed with 5 Ag/mL puromycin. C, clonogenic survival of control and MLH1-complemented HCT116 cells treated with MNNG or Cr(VI).
D, a model describing MMR-dependent genotoxicity of Cr(VI) involving recognition and sequential processing of Asc/cysteine-Cr-DNA cross-links (X-Cr-DNA) by MMR
proteins into toxic DSB. Binary Cr-DNA adducts are poor substrates for MSH2-MSH6 binding and their toxicity is weak and MMR-independent.

2.5- and 6.7-fold reductions in frameshift mutagenesis at CA
repeats relative to the vector control (Fig. 6B, right). CA
dinucleotide instability in two other clones was as high as in
parental HCT116 cells (not shown). In contrast, chromosome 3
transfer completely restored CA repeat stability, with the frequency
of puromycin-resistant clones decreasing 190-fold from 38.2  10 6
for HCT116 to 0.2  10 6 HCT116+chr.3 cells. Thus, HCT116+chr.3
cells seemed to acquire the ability to compensate for the loss of
functional MSH3, as evidenced by their sensitivity to Cr(VI) and
highly efficient repair of slippage errors in dinucleotide sequences.
Introduction of one extra chromosome into diploid human cells
has been found to induce large alterations in the transcriptome of
the trisomic and other cellular chromosomes (43), and this could
have created either a new loop–processing activity or somehow
enhanced affinity of MutSa to the substrates that are typically

www.aacrjournals.org

recognized by MutSh. Despite the involvement of the alternative
MSH3-like activity, HCT116+chr.3 cells (20) faithfully recapitulated
toxic responses of H460 and primary human cells to Cr-DNA
damage (21, 29).

Discussion
Pulldown experiments with Cr-modified probes and formation
of MSH6 foci in Cr-treated cells in the absence of DNA replication
indicated that MSH2-MSH6 dimer acted as a sensor of Cr-DNA
damage. Binding of MutSa complex to Cr-adducted DNA was
independent on MSH3 and MLH1, demonstrating that the initial
recognition of Cr-DNA damage was very similar to the detection
of single base mismatches (1, 2). Reduction of Cr(VI) by Asc
or cysteine created a combination of Cr-DNA adducts and

Asc/cysteine-Cr-DNA cross-links and led to strong binding of
MSH2-MSH6 to oligos containing on average 3 Cr/oligo. No
significant binding was detected using probes with 1 to 3 binary
Cr-DNA adducts. These results indicated that Cr-DNA cross-links
were high affinity substrates for MMR proteins, which was further
confirmed in the plasmid replication experiments. The ability of
cellular Asc to enhance cytotoxicity and DSB formation by Cr(VI)
strictly in a MMR-dependent manner (21, 29) was consistent with a
strong MMR-activating potential of Asc-Cr-DNA cross-links.
Because Cr-DNA adducts and cross-links showed no differences
in the sites of DNA attachment (22, 23), higher affinity of MutSa for
cross-links could be associated with their increased bulkiness.
Although binding of MSH2 and MSH6 in amounts similar to the
samples with a single G/T mismatch required up to 3 Cr/oligo for
Cr(VI)-cysteine or Cr(VI)-Asc reactions, the affinity of MutSa
complex for Cr-DNA cross-links was probably as good as for the
mismatch. First, because Asc/Cr(VI)-modified oligos contained 75%
inactive Cr-DNA adducts, G/T mismatch-equivalent levels of
MSH2-MSH6 binding were reached with 0.75 cross-links/probe.
Second, because Cr-DNA binding was random, only f1/3 of all
Cr-DNA modifications were expected to be within the central area
of our 38-bp long oligo, which provided a sufficient sequence length
for binding of MMR proteins (44).
MMR-dependent DSB formation by Sn1-methylating agents
involves the production of persistent single-strand gaps after the
first S phase and a subsequent collapse of replication forks in the
second S-phase (17, 45). The unique aspect of MMR-induced DSB
in Cr-damaged DNA was an almost immediate appearance of DSB
after short Cr exposures. DSB production in Cr-treated cells also
showed unprecedented requirement for MSH3, a component of
the MutSh complex principally responsible for recognition and
repair of DNA loops with z2 nucleotides (1, 2). MSH2-MSH3
dimer acted downstream of MSH2-MSH6 because MSH6 depletion eliminated MSH3 foci, whereas MSH3 silencing had no effect
on the levels of MSH6 foci. Formation of MSH3 foci was also
blocked by MLH1 knockdown, indicating that the recruitment of
MSH3 occurs after the completion of a series of MutSa-initiated
MMR events (Fig. 6D). What signal or DNA structure activates
MSH3 is currently unclear but the formation of hairpins or loops
in single-stranded regions containing repetitive sequences could
represent one possibility. Alternatively, MSH3 could be recruited
by recombination intermediates formed at the sites of singlestranded gaps generated by MutSa-MutLa activity. MSH2-MSH3
dimer is known to participate in rejection of imperfectly matched
sequences during homologous recombination through activation
of endonucleases (46). In the case of Cr-damaged DNA, MSH3dependent recruitment of endonucleases could lead to the

inappropriate cleavage of recombination products and formation
of toxic DSB.
A combination of our findings with phase-specific markers and
replication-arrested cells indicates that the formation of Cr-DNA
damage–processing MMR complexes occurs in late S phase.
Normal initial formation of MSH6 foci in replication-arrested cells
and then parallel increases in the total number of MSH6 foci and
MSH6 foci/cyclin B1–double positive cells after removal of
replication block are indicative of a relatively rapid progression
of MSH6 foci–containing cells into G2 phase. MMR-promoted DSB
foci were predominantly found in G2 cells but inhibition of DNA
synthesis by aphidicolin completely blocked DSB induction. Thus,
accumulation of MSH6/3 foci and DSB after Cr(VI) exposure seems
to require not replication but the progression of cells through late S
into early G2 phase, which creates the permissible conditions for
cleavage of both DNA strands. S phase cells display higher
thresholds for checkpoint activation relative to G2 cells (47) and
increased sensitivity to DNA damage–induced signaling in the late
S phase could be one contributing factor to the formation of MSH6
foci at this stage of cell cycle. Another important event occurring in
late S phase is the induction of exonuclease-1 expression (48),
which is a critical MMR component that has recently been found
to be necessary for cell death by the MMR-dependent toxicant
6-thioguanine (49).
Recent risk assessment studies have shown that even Cr(VI)
exposures not exceeding a new, 10 times lower permissible limit
could result in as many as 45 additional cancer deaths per 1,000
workers (50). These risks are striking considering relatively modest
amounts of inhaled Cr(VI) and high rates of Cr-DNA damage
removal by nucleotide excision repair (30). A rapid activation of both
MMR branches apparently outcompetes beneficial repair processes
and is the principal cause of chromosomal breaks at low chromate
doses. Drugs producing DNA adducts with similarly rapid MMR
processing into toxic DSB should offer greater clinical efficacy due to
less dependence on repair deficiency of cancer cells and no need for
persistence of adducts until second S phase, which is a requirement
for the currently used Sn1 alkylating agents (17).
