Abstract
To determine the role of 14-3-3 in colorectal cancer apoptosis
induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
we evaluated the effects of sulindac on 14-3-3E protein
expression in colorectal cancer cells. Sulindac sulfide inhibited
14-3-3E proteins in HT-29 and DLD-1 cells in a time- and
concentration-dependent manner. Sulindac sulfone at 600
Mmol/L inhibited 14-3-3E protein expression in HT-29. Indomethacin and SC-236, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
inhibitor, exerted a similar effect as sulindac. Sulindac suppressed 14-3-3E promoter activity. As 14-3-3E promoter
activation is mediated by peroxisome proliferator–activated
receptor D (PPARD), we determined the correlation between
14-3-3E inhibition and PPARD suppression by NSAIDs. Sulindac
sulfide inhibited PPARD protein expression and PPARD
transcriptional activity. Overexpression of PPARD by adenoviral transfer rescued 14-3-3E proteins from elimination by
sulindac or indomethacin. NSAID-induced 14-3-3E suppression was associated with reduced cytosolic Bad with elevation
of mitochondrial Bad and increase in apoptosis which was
rescued by Ad-PPARD transduction. Stable expression of 14-33E in HT-29 significantly protected cells from apoptosis. Our
findings shed light on a novel mechanism by which NSAIDs
induce colorectal cancer apoptosis via the PPARD/14-3-3E
transcriptional pathway. These results suggest that 14-3-3E is a
target for the prevention and therapy of colorectal cancer.

Introduction
Human and animal studies have shown that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) suppress colorectal tumorigenesis
(1). Population-based epidemiologic studies have shown that use of
aspirin and NSAID reduces risk of colorectal cancer (2, 3). Animal
experiments provide evidence for control of colorectal cancer by
NSAIDs such as sulindac and selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
inhibitors (4, 5). Results from clinical trials have documented the
efficacy of sulindac and selective COX-2 inhibitors in reducing the
size and numbers of colon adenomatous polyps in patients with
familial adenomatous polyposis, a precancerous condition (6, 7).
The action of NSAIDs on controlling colorectal cancer is attributed
to the inhibition of COX-2 (8), which is overexpressed in a majority
of patients with colorectal cancer (9, 10). NSAID could also exert its
action on colorectal cancer in a COX-2–independent manner (11).
It is well documented that NSAIDs, notably sulindac, indometh-

acin, and selective COX-2 inhibitors exert their actions by inducing
colorectal cancer cell apoptosis (12, 13). The mechanism by which
these agents induce apoptosis is not entirely clear. It was proposed
that NSAID-induced apoptosis might be mediated by downregulation of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-y (PPARy;
ref. 14). Several studies have shown that PPARy is overexpressed in
colorectal cancer and PPARy is activated by prostacyclin generated
by colorectal cancer cells (15). Activation of PPARy accelerates
intestinal adenoma growth whereas genetic disruption of PPARy
decreases the tumorigenicity of human colorectal cancer cells
(16, 17). It has been reported that PPARy plays an important role in
cellular resistance to apoptotic insults (18, 19). Activation of PPARy
was reported to be associated with increased expression of
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and activation of Akt (20).
Akt is recognized as a key signaling molecule for transmitting
survival messages. We have recently reported that PPARy activation
by prostacyclin or L-165041, a synthetic PPARy ligand, increases the
expression of 14-3-3 proteins, especially the 14-3-3q isoform (21).
Promoter analysis identifies three PPAR response elements (PPRE)
located between 1426 and 1477 of the 14-3-3q promoter region.
Deletion of these PPREs abrogates the protective effect of
prostacyclin or L-165041 (21). Our previous findings suggest that
PPARy-mediated 14-3-3q up-regulation plays a crucial role in
endothelial cell resistance to apoptosis (21). It is unclear whether
14-3-3q is involved in colorectal cancer cell survival. We postulated
in this study that NSAIDs induce apoptosis by reducing 14-3-3q via
suppressing PPARy. Reduction in 14-3-3q protein levels results in
mitochondrial Bad translocation and colorectal cancer cell
apoptosis. The results show that sulindac sulfide, sulindac sulfone,
indomethacin, and SC-236 suppressed HT-29 14-3-3q protein and
promoter activity, which correlated with the suppression of PPARy
protein expression. The reduction in 14-3-3q levels was accompanied by enhanced mitochondrial Bad translocation and HT-29
apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. HT-29 and DLD-1 cells were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HT-29 were maintained
in DMEM and DLD-1 were maintained in RPMI 1604 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin at 37jC in a humidified
5% CO2 atmosphere. Cell culture media and antibiotics were purchased
from BRL Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). Sulindac sulfide and
sulindac sulfone were obtained from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Solon, OH).
Indomethacin, SC-236, MG-132, and cell-permeable caspase 3 inhibitor, acDVED aldehyde (DEVD-CHO), were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). We
used 10 Amol/L of MG-132 and 50 Amol/L of DEVD-CHO, which were
reported to block proteasome and caspase 3 activities, respectively (22, 23).
Recombinant adenoviral vectors. Replication-defective recombinant
adenoviruses were generated by homologous recombination and amplified
in 293 cells as described previously (24, 25). The recombinant viruses were
purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation and the virus titers were
determined by a plaque assay as previously described (24). Ad-PPARy was

HT-29 cells were transfected with Ad-GFP (green fluorescent protein) or
Ad-PPARy at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 50 for 48 h before treatment
with indomethacin or sulindac sulfide.
Preparation of mitochondrial fraction. HT-29 cells treated with
indicated reagents (sulindac sulfide, 160 Amol/L; sulindac sulfone, 300 Amol/L;
indomethacin, 800 Amol/L; or SC-236, 40 Amol/L) for 8 h were washed
thrice with PBS and harvested by centrifugation. Mitochondrial fractions
were prepared by a mitochondria isolation kit (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) as
described previously (26). The mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were
purified by two-step gradient centrifugation and stored at 20jC.
Mitochondrial Bad protein level was analyzed by Western blotting. Heat
shock protein 60 (Hsp60) was used as a mitochondrial marker.
Immunoprecipitation. HT-29 cells treated with the indicated reagents
were harvested and lysed in 1 radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
(Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) with cocktail protease inhibitors (Sigma).
Lysate proteins (200 Ag) were immunoprecipitated with a human 14-3-3q
antibody. The immunoprecipitated complex was pulled down with protein
A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After washing five
times, the proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using a Bad antibody.
Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer containing protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were
determined by a Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) protein assay kit. Cell lysate
proteins (25 Ag) were applied to each lane and analyzed by Western blots as
previously described (25). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against 14-3-3q
(diluted at 1:250), and goat polyclonal antibodies against Hsp60 (1:2,000)
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibody
against PPARy (1:500) was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor,
MI). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against Bad (1:500) was purchased from
Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal antibody against actin (1:5,000)
was obtained from Oncogene (Boston, MA). Donkey anti-rabbit or donkey
anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Protein bands were visualized by an
enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce, Rockford, IL).
Assay of apoptosis. Apoptotic cells were analyzed by Hoechst staining
according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Hoechst 33258 is a cell-permeable dye which is sensitive to nuclear
DNA damage and is useful in detecting apoptosis of unfixed living cells (27).
In brief, HT-29 cells transiently transfected with Ad-PPARy, Ad-GFP, or
stably transfected HT-29 cells were treated with 160 Amol/L of sulindac
sulfide for 24 h. After washing, they were incubated with 1 Ag/mL of

Hoechst 33258 in the dark for 15 min, centrifuged and washed with PBS.
The washed cells were examined under fluorescent microscopy (excitation
at 352 nm and emission at 461 nm). Apoptotic cells exhibited strong nuclear
staining with overt nuclear morphologic changes as previously described
(27). The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by counting at least
200 cells.
Plasmid constructs and luciferase reporter assay. A human 14-3-3q
expression construct was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pCDNA 3.1+
vector (Invitrogen) and a 14-3-3q promoter subcloned into pGL3 vector
were prepared as previously described (21). PPRE reporter (14) was kindly
provided by Drs. Kinzler and Vogelstein at Johns Hopkins University. For
the luciferase assay, cells were transfected with the reporter constructs by
Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for 48 h. After treatment
with the indicated reagents, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was
measured using a kit from Promega (Madison, WI), and the emitted light
was determined in a luminometer.
Establishment of 14-3-3E stable cell line. Control vector (pCDNA3.1+)
and human 14-3-3q expression vectors which contain a neomycin-resistant
cassette were transfected into HT-29 cells by using an Effectene transfection
kit for 48 h. The transfected cells were screened by incubation with 500 Ag/mL
of G418 (Sigma) for 4 weeks. The cell lines which stably expressed 14-3-3q
were isolated from individual colonies and maintained in DMEM with 10%
fetal bovine serum and 200 Ag/mL of G418.
Statistical analysis. ANOVA was used to analyze statistical differences
among multiple groups. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

Results
Suppression of 14-3-3E by sulindac sulfide and COX-2
inhibitors. To evaluate the effect of sulindac on 14-3-3q protein
levels, we treated HT-29 with sulindac sulfide at 0 to 160 Amol/L
for 4 to 24 h. 14-3-3q proteins were analyzed by Western blotting.
Sulindac sulfide did not have an effect at 4 h of treatment,
suppressed 14-3-3q at 8 h only at 160 Amol/L, and exerted a
concentration-dependent inhibition of 14-3-3q at 24 h of treatment
(Fig. 1A). Sulindac sulfone had no effect at 300 Amol/L but
suppressed 14-3-3q expression at 600 Amol/L (Fig. 1B). Indomethacin, a nonselective COX inhibitor, or SC-236, a selective COX-2
inhibitor, also concentration-dependently inhibited 14-3-3q protein

levels (Fig. 1C). Sulindac sulfide suppressed 14-3-3q protein levels in
DLD-1 with a pattern similar to that of HT-29 (Fig. 1D).
Inhibition of 14-3-3E promoter activity by sulindac sulfide.
To determine whether sulindac sulfide inhibits 14-3-3q at the
transcription level, we transfected HT-29 with a human 14-3-3q
promoter construct ( 1628/+24) and treated the transfected cells
with various concentrations of sulindac sulfide for 24 h. Sulindac
sulfide concentration-dependently inhibited 14-3-3q promoter
activity (Fig. 2A). Sulindac-induced 14-3-3q protein suppression
was not influenced by MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, or DEVDCHO, a caspase 3 inhibitor (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results
suggest that sulindac suppresses 14-3-3q primarily at the transcriptional level.
Restoration of 14-3-3E by adenoviral PPARD transfer. We
have recently discovered that 14-3-3q transcription is mediated by
PPARy (21). We were, therefore, interested in learning whether
sulindac-induced 14-3-3q suppression involves PPARy. HT-29 cells
were treated with sulindac sulfide (160 Amol/L) or indomethacin
(800 Amol/L) for 24 h and PPARy proteins were analyzed by
Western blots. PPARy levels became undetectable following
treatment with either agent (Fig. 3A). To ensure that PPARy is
active in HT-29, we transfected the cells with a PPRE construct and
treated the cells with sulindac sulfide for 24 h. Sulindac reduced the
PPRE activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). To
determine whether PPARy overexpression rescues 14-3-3q from
sulindac or indomethacin suppression, we transduced HT-29 with

www.aacrjournals.org

Ad-PPARy (50 moi) or Ad-GFP control (50 moi). PPARy protein
levels were increased by Ad-PPARy transduction (Fig. 4A), which is
accompanied by enhanced PPRE activity (Fig. 4B) and 14-3-3q
promoter activity (Fig. 4C). PPARy proteins in Ad-PPARy–
transduced cells were not altered by sulindac or indomethacin
(Fig. 4A), but the PPARy transcriptional activity (Fig. 4B) and
the 14-3-3q promoter activity (Fig. 4C) were partially suppressed.
14-3-3q proteins were increased by Ad-PPARy overexpression which
were suppressed by sulindac sulfide and indomethacin (Fig. 4D).
Mitochondrial Bad translocation and cell death by sulindac
and COX-2 inhibitors. 14-3-3 proteins bind phosphorylated Bad
and sequester it in cytosol. Apoptotic signals induce Bad to release
from 14-3-3 and translocate to the mitochondria where it disrupts
the protective action of Bcl-XL, thereby promoting apoptosis via
the mitochondrial pathway (28, 29). It was reported that upregulation of 14-3-3q protein levels by PPARy ligands enhances Bad
binding and reduces Bad translocation to mitochondria (21).
Because sulindac suppresses 14-3-3q in HT-29, it is predicted that
sulindac reduces cytosolic Bad sequestration and reciprocally
enhances Bad localization to mitochondria. To confirm this, we did
two types of experiments. First, we prepared mitochondrial and
cytosolic fractions from HT-29 treated with or without sulindac
sulfide or sulfone, indomethacin, or SC-236, and Bad in the
mitochondrial fraction was analyzed by Western blotting. As a
control, the mitochondria-resident protein Hsp60 was concurrently
analyzed. Second, we immunoprecipitated cell lysates of HT-29

treated with or without sulindac sulfide or indomethacin by a
14-3-3q antibody and analyzed Bad in the immunoprecipitate
with a Bad antibody. The results show that in the absence of
NSAIDs, most Bad were localized to the cytosol, whereas Hsp60
was predominantly detected in the mitochondrial fraction with
a trace quantity detected in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 5A). Bad
was detected at a very low level in mitochondrial fraction
(Fig. 5A). Sulindac and indomethacin enhanced mitochondrial
Bad (Fig. 5A) and suppressed binding of Bad to 14-3-3q (Fig. 5B).
SC-236 enhanced mitochondrial Bad to an extent comparable
to sulindac sulfide and indomethacin (Fig. 5A). These results
suggest that sulindac, indomethacin and SC-236 induce Bad
translocation to mitochondria as a consequence of severe 14-3-3q
suppression.
Rescue of NSAID-induced apoptosis by Ad-PPARD and 14-3-3E.
Sulindac sulfide and indomethacin induced HT-29 apoptosis as
evidenced by an increase in Hoechst-positive cells. Apoptosis was
reduced by transduction of cells with Ad-PPARy (Fig. 5C). To
ascertain the role of 14-3-3q in NSAID-induced HT-29 apoptosis,
we prepared a HT-29 cell line overexpressing 14-3-3q (HT-2914-3-3q)
and a control cell line (HT-29CTR; Fig. 6A). In HT-29 control cells,
sulindac suppressed 14-3-3q proteins (Fig. 6A) accompanied by a
large increase in apoptosis (Fig. 6B). Overexpression of 14-3-3q
proteins in HT-2914-3-3q cells (Fig. 6A) prevented apoptosis by >50%
(Fig. 6B).

Discussion
Our findings show for the first time that sulindac and other
NSAIDs drastically suppress 14-3-3q expression in colorectal
cancer cells, resulting in reduced Bad sequestration in cytosol,
increased mitochondrial Bad, and enhanced apoptosis. The 14-3-3
family comprises at least seven members in mammalian cells (30).
They share sequence homology and biochemical properties,
interact with more than 100 cellular proteins, and have diverse
biological activities (31). They bind phosphorylated Bad, thereby
sequestering Bad in cytosol and suppressing Bad-induced
mitochondrial injury and the consequential apoptosis via the
intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway (32). It was reported
in endothelial cells that among the 14-3-3 members, 14-3-3q is
expressed in abundance, and its cellular level is regulated and
is crucial in protecting cells from oxidative damage (21). The
results in this study show that 14-3-3q is constitutively expressed
in HT-29 and DLD-1 cells and is a target of NSAID-induced
apoptosis. Sulindac, indomethacin, and SC-236 suppress 14-3-3q
expression in HT-29 accompanied by increased translocation of
Bad to mitochondria and apoptosis. Stable overexpression of
14-3-3q alleviates sulindac-induced apoptosis. Taken together,
these results strongly suggest that the suppression of 14-3-3q is
a major mechanism by which NSAIDs induce colorectal cancer
apoptosis.

14-3-3q transcription requires PPARy and is regulated by the
level of PPARy, as evidenced by increased 14-3-3q proteins in
Ad-PPARy–transduced cells. Our results are consistent with a
previous report that sulindac suppresses PPARy transcription
activity (14), and provide new data which attribute reduced PPARy
transcription activity to the suppression of PPARy protein
expression. The results show a good correlation between sulindacand indomethacin-induced 14-3-3q and PPARy suppressions.
Furthermore, PPARy overexpression by Ad-PPARy transduction
rescues 14-3-3q from suppressions by sulindac sulfide at 80 Amol/L
or indomethacin at 400 Amol/L. These data indicate that sulindac
and other NSAIDs suppress PPARy expression, thereby blocking
PPARy-mediated 14-3-3q transcription. Although Ad-PPARy abrogates 14-3-3q suppression by sulindac and indomethacin at 80 and
300 Amol/L, respectively, it only partially corrected 14-3-3q levels
suppressed by higher concentrations of sulindac (160 Amol/L)
or indomethacin (800 Amol/L). Lack of complete correction by
Ad-PPARy may be due to the following reasons. First, activated
PPARy promotes transcription by forming a heterodimer with
RXR nuclear receptor (14). Overexpression of PPARy alone without
concurrent RXR overexpression may, therefore, be inadequate to
exert maximal transcriptional activation. Second, sulindac and
other NSAIDs have diverse COX-2–dependent and COX-2–independent effects on signaling transduction and gene expression.
Lack of a complete rescue of 14-3-3q suppression and cell apoptosis
may suggest that PPARy is not the only pathway via which NSAIDs
suppress 14-3-3q. Furthermore, differential effects of Ad-PPARy
(50 moi) on rescuing 80 versus 160 Amol/L sulindac-induced 14-3-3q
suppression may reflect dose-dependent effects on diverse cellular
functions. Lastly, lack of a correlation between the magnitude of
PPARy overexpression and 14-3-3q rescue could also be attributed
to the requirement of PPARy posttranslational modification for its
full transactivation activity. Because neither MG-132 nor DEVDCHO blocks the 14-3-3q–suppressing effect of sulindac, it is unlikely

that the reduction in 14-3-3q protein levels are due to degradation
by ubiquitin-proteasome or caspase 3.
PPARy expression is regulated by the h-catenin-Tcf (T cell factor)
transcriptional program (14). The wild-type adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene product binds and targets
h-catenin for degradation, thereby suppressing PPARy expression
(14). Adenomatous polyposis coli mutation results in increased
h-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus and complexes with
Tcf to form an active transcription factor that binds to specific
responsive elements on PPARy and up-regulates PPARy expression
in familial adenomatous polyposis (14, 33). It is reported that
sulindac and celecoxib inhibit h-catenin expression and/or the
transcriptional activity of the h-catenin/Tcf complex (34, 35). It
is, therefore, possible that sulindac, SC-236, and other NSAIDs
suppress PPARy expression through the h-catenin/Tcf transcription pathway.
Sulindac and other NSAIDs may induce colorectal cancer cell
apoptosis by COX-2–dependent and COX-2–independent mechanisms (36–39). COX-2 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer and
COX-2-derived prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) has been shown to activate
PPARy in colorectal cancer cells (15). PPARy activation confers
resistance to apoptosis in colorectal cancer as well as a number of
non–cancer cells such as endothelial, renal interstitial, cardiomyocytes and keratinocytes (18, 19, 21). Sulindac sulfide and selective
COX-2 inhibitors may induce apoptosis by blocking COX-2 derived
PGI2 production, thereby suppressing PPARy activation and the
antiapoptosis action of PPARy. COX-2–derived prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) up-regulates h-catenin expression (40) and NSAIDs may
further suppress h-catenin–mediated PPARy expression by blocking PGE2 production. However, a recent report has shown that
sulindac, selective COX-2 inhibitors, and a host of classic NSAIDs
inhibit h-catenin by a COX-2–independent mechanism (41). Our
results reveal that sulindac sulfone, which does not inhibit COX-2,
is capable of inhibiting 14-3-3q expression, suggesting that NSAIDs

2 and 3 are considered COX-2–independent. In process 2,
NSAIDs block extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK )
activation, thereby reducing Bad phosphorylation and
enhancing Bad translocation to the mitochondria. In
process 3, NSAIDs inhibit Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 protein levels.
A common result of these processes is a reduced ratio
of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 to Bad and Bax at mitochondria, and an
increased release of proapoptotic factors, notably
Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria into the cytosol which
contribute to caspase 3 activation and apoptosis.

suppress 14-3-3q by a COX-2–independent mechanism. Regardless
of the COX-2 involvement, an important finding is that reduction
in 14-3-3q levels by sulindac and other NSAIDs results in a decline
in Bad sequestration and an increase in Bad translocation to the
mitochondria where Bad binds and inactivates the antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family proteins, notably Bcl-XL and Bcl-2. It was reported
that sulindac suppresses Bcl-XL expression, creating an imbalance
between Bcl-XL and Bax, and subsequent mitochondria-mediated
apoptosis (42). Moreover, sulindac inhibits Bcl-2 expression (43),
further enhancing Bad- and Bax-mediated mitochondria damage,
Smac/DIABLO release, and apoptosis (44). Taken together, our
results and the published data suggest that sulindac and other
NSAIDs induce colorectal cancer cell apoptosis by multiple mitochondrial apoptotic processes as proposed in Fig. 6C. First,
NSAIDs suppress PPARy, thereby reducing 14-3-3q level and Bad
sequestration. Second, NSAIDs inhibit extracellular signal–
regulated kinase, thereby blocking Bad phosphorylation (45), and
further reducing Bad sequestration leading to excessive Bad

translocation to the mitochondria. Lastly, NSAIDs inhibit Bcl-XL
and Bcl-2 expression resulting in a reduction in the ratio of
antiapoptotic to proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins on the
mitochondrial membrane with consequent loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential, release of proapoptotic factors especially
Smac/DIABLO resulting in caspase activation and apoptosis.
These processes are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. As
PPARy or 14-3-3q overexpression rescues apoptosis, the PPARy/
14-3-3q transcriptional pathway represents a major pathway for
colorectal cancer cell survival.
