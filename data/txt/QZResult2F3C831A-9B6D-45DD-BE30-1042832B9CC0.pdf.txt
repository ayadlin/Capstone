ABSTRACT
Genetic alterations involving TMPRSS2-ERG alterations and deletion of key tumor
suppressor genes are associated with development and progression of prostate cancer
(PCa). However, less defined are early events that may contribute to the development
of high-risk metastatic prostate cancer. Bioinformatic analysis of existing tumor
genomic data from PCa patients revealed that WAVE complex gene alterations
are associated with a greater likelihood of prostate cancer recurrence. Further
analysis of primary vs. castration resistant prostate cancer indicate that disruption
of WAVE complex gene expression, and particularly WAVE1 gene (WASF1) loss, is
also associated with castration resistance, where WASF1 is frequently co-deleted
with PTEN and resists androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Hence, we propose that
WASF1 status defines a subtype of ADT-resistant patients. Better understanding of
the effects of WAVE pathway disruption will lead to development of better diagnostic
and treatment modalities.

levels of PTEN increase the availability of phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 triphosphate (PIP3) for driving PI 3-kinase
(PI3K)-dependent signaling, such as cellular growth
pathways downstream of AKT (protein kinase B) [7, 11].
In addition, we previously implicated ABI1 (SSH3BP1) as
a putative tumor suppressor in prostate cancer [12] and
have demonstrated that disruption of Abi1 in the mouse
prostate leads to prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN),
but not to invasive prostate cancer [13]. We have therefore
sought to find additional genes that cooperate with ABI1 in
prostate tumor progression.
In cells Abi1 is incorporated in the WAVE complex.
In mammalian cells, several distinct WAVE complexes can
form, depending on the isoform of proteins that is expressed
[14]. Each WAVE complex assembles from ubiquitously
expressed variants of 5 polypeptides: WAVE, Abelson inter­
actor (Abi or SSH3BP1), Rac1-associated protein (Sra-1),

INTRODUCTION
As the most-common noncutaneous cancer in men
worldwide [1], mechanisms contributing to development
of prostate cancer at all stages of disease remain of high
interest for both diagnosis and treatment of clinicallyrelevant disease. Consistent with the multi-hit hypothesis,
several genes that control critical growth, survival, and/
or apoptotic pathways [2] must be altered to lead to fully
penetrant prostate cancer [3–5]. A wide body of literature
has identified many complex genetic alterations involved
in neoplastic transformation, including TMPRSS2-ETS
(ERG) chromosomal translocations and deletion of tumor
suppressor genes (PTEN, TP53, RB1, NKX3–1, and
CDKN1B) [3–10]. Of these, selection for the deletion
of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) occurs in
approximately 30% of prostate cancers, as lowered

Nck-associated protein (Nap), and Brk1 (HSPC300)
[15–17]. Except for Brk1 [18], for which only one isoform
exists, each of these proteins is a member of a protein family
consisting of 2–3 genes in mammals including alternatively
spliced isoforms of 10 genes [14, 19]: (i) WASF1, WAVE2
(WASF2), and WAVE3 (WASF3), (ii) ABI1, ABI2, and
ABI3, (iii) Sra-1 and PIR121 (CYFIP1 and CYFIP2), and
(iv) Nap1 (NCKAP1) and Hem1 (NCKAP1L1). Functionally,
WAVE complexes are major actin cytoskeleton regulatory
factors that promote actin polymerization through an Arp2/3
dependent mechanism [20]. Other functions of WAVE
complex or its components involve binding to variety of
membrane receptors [21], intracellular signaling [22, 23],
and transcription [22, 24]. WAVE complexes are involved
in cell motility and migration, cellular adhesion, cell-to-cell
communication, cell division, and immunological responses
[17, 25–31]. Thus, WAVE complexes are involved numerous
cellular functions requiring actin cytoskeleton reorganization
and dynamics, processes with roles in tumor progression and
metastasis [32].
Consistent with this, dysregulation of WAVE
complex or its components is associated with human
cancer [33–35] including prostate cancer [12, 36–39], as
the WAVE pathway cross talks with the PI3K pathway. It
has been shown previously that PIP3 can bind directly to
WAVE protein [40], and we and others have demonstrated
that the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K interacts with Abi1
[23, 41]. Importantly, we have also shown that genetic
inactivation of Abi1 led to down-regulation of WASF1
(and WASF2 [42]) which in turn resulted in increased
phosphorylation of Akt in murine prostate tissue [13].
To this effect, altered levels of WAVE complex genes
would result in disruption of the WAVE complex’s ability
to regulate p85, and thus would phenocopy deletion of
PTEN in mediating cancer progression. Therefore we
hypothesize that prostate cancers select for cells with
lower levels of WAVE complex proteins.
In patients with metastatic PCa, standard treatments
involve either surgical or medical castration, which
effectively prevents testicular testosterone from driving
androgen receptor (AR) activation in the tumor cell [43].
The fact that most patients invariably relapse has led to
profound interest in identifying mechanisms contributing
to the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC) and commercial production of inhibitors of adrenal
sources of androgens and AR pathway inhibitors such
as galeterone, abiraterone and enzalutamide [44–46].
However, the fact that PTEN is deleted or down-regulated
in these cancers has intensified investigation of how
PI3K contributes to androgen independence via a PTENdependent mechanism. Not surprisingly, simultaneous
inhibition of both AR and PI3K effectively blocked growth
of human PCa xenografts [47–49]. These data further
reinforce the need to identify causative mechanisms of
CRPC development, especially in the context of PTEN
deletion.

Therefore, to assess whether prostate cancer
progression to castration resistance is mediated by changes
to WAVE complex, we performed bioinformatic metaanalyses on several published datasets, including mutation,
copy number, and gene expression data accumulated
as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), as well
as other publicly-available datasets deposited in GEO
from experiments performed at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center (BIDMC), Memorial Sloan Kettering
Medical Center (MSKCC) and the University of Michigan
(UMICH) [7, 10, 50]. By comparing results across
independent cohorts, we observed shifts in the frequency
of WAVE complex gene alterations, which suggest that
WAVE complex disruption may be a putative driver of
prostate tumorigenesis. Importantly, we observed that
deletion of WASF1, the gene that codes for WAVE1,
occurs more frequently with PTEN deletion in metastatic
lethal vs. primary disease, suggesting that WASF1 loss
represents an aggressive of subtype of prostate cancer. It is
thus possible that patients who harbor tumors with WASF1
deletion may benefit from either earlier or more aggressive
intervention.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We had previously assessed the status of ABI1
in a small cohort of primary prostate tissue [51], so we
expanded our interrogation of WAVE complex alterations
to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and molecular
analyses performed on these samples. We hypothesized
that alterations to the WAVE complex may contribute to
increased tumorigenicity and therefore poorer long-term
outcome. When we interrogated the dataset for cases
with mutations, copy number alterations, or abnormal
expression, we found that alterations to WAVE complex
genes were significantly associated with a 13.43% increase
in the rate of biochemical recurrence (BCR) within
5 years (Figure 1a). Interrogating other datasets for which
biochemical recurrence rates were available, we observed
a similar trend in the MKSCC dataset, where alterations
to WAVE complex genes were associated with a 11.14%
increase in the five-year BCR rate (Supplementary
Figure 1). Strikingly, the most common alterations were
not mutations (Figure 1b) nor recurrent up- or downregulation (Figure 1c), but rather copy number variation
to WAVE complex genes, preeminently WAVE1 (WASF1)
(Figure 1d), which was deleted hemizygously in 54 cases
(16.9%) and homozygously in 32 cases (10%).
These observations are consistent with several recent
reports that describe many recurrent translocations and
deletions in prostate cancer and surprisingly few recurrent
mutations. Indeed, mutations to SPOP, MED12 and FOXA1
comprise less than 10% (each) recurrence in primary
PCa exomes sequenced as part of TCGA and previous
studies [52], but large chromosomal events occur far more
frequently, with translocations (or interstitial deletions)

involving TMPRSS2 and ETS-family transcription factors
(such as ERG) in approximately 50% of cases, or tumor
suppressor deletions (PTEN, NKX3–1) in approximately
30–50% of cases [7]. Our observation of WASF1 deletion
was not as frequent (approximately 25%). Although these
deletions were identified, these same cases did not indicate
lower levels of WASF1 mRNA. While we cannot rule out
the possibility that cells can compensate by up-regulating
the remaining copy, recent evidence suggests that the WAVE
complex is regulated mostly at the protein level [42, 53].
Nonetheless, the increased frequency of biochemical
recurrence of tumors with WAVE complex gene alterations
and our observation of recurrent deletion of WASF1 in
primary prostate cancer therefore led us to ask whether
WAVE complex was similarly disrupted in advanced PCa,
in a castration-resistant (CRPC) setting. Examination
of gene expression microarrays from 131 primary PCa
(MSKCC dataset [7]) and 33 CRPC (BIDMC dataset
[50]) revealed marked down-regulation of ABI1, ABI2,
and NCKAP1 in the CRPC samples (Figure 2a). WASF1
expression displayed modest variation (within and
between sets), which is consistent with the observation
from TCGA (see Figure 1c) that WASF1 down-regulation
by itself is not a mechanism of progression in PCa,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

although down-regulation of ABI1, ABI2, or NCKAP1 may
lead to destabilization of WAVE complex and thus lower
levels of WAVE1 protein.
Importantly, the WAVE complex acts as a mediator
PI-3 kinase-directed cell motility, and thus may also
contribute to overall tumorigenenicity when dysregulated
[54, 55]. Given its function downstream of PI3K, we
therefore sought to explore WASF1 copy number status in
the context of PTEN deletion, a frequent genomic lesion
found in primary and advanced PCa [56–58]. To make
comparisons, we selected two published datasets (from
MSKCC [7] and UMICH [10]) in which copy number
analysis was performed simultaneously in both primary
PCa and CRPC. As anticipated, PTEN and WASF1 were
frequently deleted (hemizygously and homozygously) in
primary PCa from both datasets (Figures 2b and 2c). To
our surprise however, PTEN and WASF1 deletion were
mutually exclusive in primary PCa, but hemizygous
WASF1 deletion co-occurred with both hemizygous and
homozygous PTEN deletion in CRPC (P < 0.0001 for the
MSKCC set, P = 0.0006, for the UMICH set). As PTEN
and WASF1 are on different chromosomes (10q23 and
6q21) these events are not physically linked, and because
in CPRC nearly all WASF1 deletions were in cases that

also harbored at least one copy of PTEN (but not vice
versa), these data suggest that WASF1 deletion is an earlier
event preceding tumor cells’ acquisition of PTEN deletions
that likely occur later as tumors progress.
Importantly, as PTEN and WASF1 were rarely
deleted simultaneously in the same case in primary
PCa (see Figures 2b and 2c), selection for dual loss
may be associated with processes that mediate disease

progression. Specifically, the frequency of WASF1 deletion
in lethal prostate cancer and its co-deletion with PTEN
raised the possibility that advanced PCa cells select for
PTEN deletion in cases with WASF1 already deleted in
order to drive PI 3-kinase signaling in castration-resistant
cases with stronger AR reactivation. Furthermore,

deletion of WASF1, tumors with lower WAVE1 levels

(rather than total loss of WAVE1) may similarly confer
a selective advantage at later stages of disease. Indeed,
WASF1 expression within the BIDMC dataset of CRPC
was varied to permit stratification of samples by the top
quartile of WASF1 expression (WASF1-high) vs. the lower
quartile (WASF1-low) to predict the potential effects of
WASF1 genomic deletion (Figure 3a). Consistent with
our hypothesis that low WASF1 expression represents
an aggressive phenotype, we observed significant downregulation of the putative tumor suppressors CHD1 and
CDH10 (cadherin-10) [59, 60]. Moreover, amongst the
genes most up-regulated in the WASF1-low group are
HSD17B4, which codes for an androgen inactivating
enzyme [61], and PIP (prolactin-induced protein),
whose expression was recently reported as a readout of
AR (Androgen Receptor) activity [62]. Therefore, to test
whether AR activity is indeed increased in the WASF1low cases, we performed Geneset Enrichment Analysis
(high vs. low) using the expression values for all genes.
In the WASF1-low phenotype, we observed negative
enrichment for up-regulated genes derived from a dataset
in which LNCaP cells were treated with methyltrienolone/
R1881 (Figure 3b) [63]. Indeed, these genes include the
AR targets KLK3 (PSA), TMPRSS2, and FKBP5, which
are up-regulated in the WASF1-low group (Figure 3c),
suggesting that CRPC with lower levels of WASF1 have
increased tumorigenicity.
While metastatic CRPC circumvents androgen
deprivation by intratumoral testosterone synthesis
[50], increased expression of AR target genes suggests
higher stability of ligand-bound AR and thus higher
levels of androgen synthesis. Because the reactivation
of AR activity and down-regulation of additional tumor
suppressors in these cases (see Figure 3a) represents an
aggressive prostate cancer phenotype, deletion of WASF1
and lower levels of ABI1 and ABI2 likely cooperate
with other perturbations in these CRPC for overcoming
androgen deprivation, providing a selective advantage
for those tumors harboring these genetic changes. Thus,
the normal function of the WAVE complex may be to
serve as a tumor suppressor. Therefore, WASF1 deletion
co-occurring with PTEN in advanced prostate cancers
may result in even stronger PI3K signaling, having
removed inhibitory forces from p85 (WASF1 deletion)
and increasing levels of PIP3 (PTEN deletion). Further
investigation is needed to determine the biological
consequences of WASF1 deletion, the interactions between
WAVE pathway and the AR signaling axis, and the role
of WAVE pathway in establishing tumors with long-term
aggressive potential.
