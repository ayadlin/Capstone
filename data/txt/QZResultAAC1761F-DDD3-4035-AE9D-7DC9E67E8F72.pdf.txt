ABSTRACT
The DNA damage response (DDR) is an emerging target for cancer therapy.
By modulating the DDR, including DNA repair and cell cycle arrest, the efficacy of
anticancer drugs can be enhanced and side effects reduced. We previously screened
a chemical library and identified novel DDR inhibitors including DNA damage response
inhibitor-9 (DDRI-9; 1H-Purine-2,6-dione,7-[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl]-3,7-dihydro3-methyl-8-nitro). In this study, we characterized DDRI-9 activity and found that
it inhibited phosphorylated histone variant H2AX foci formation upon DNA damage,
delayed DNA repair, and enhanced the cytotoxicity of etoposide and ionizing radiation.
It also reduced the foci formation of DNA repair-related proteins, including the protein
kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated, DNA-dependent protein kinase, breast cancer
type 1 susceptibility protein, and p53-binding protein 1, but excluding mediator of
DNA damage checkpoint protein 1. Cell cycle analysis revealed that DDRI-9 blocked
mitotic progression. Like other mitotic inhibitors, DDRI-9 treatment resulted in the
accumulation of mitotic protein and induced cell death. Thus, DDRI-9 may affect both
DDR signal amplification and mitotic progression. This study suggests that DDRI-9 is
a good lead molecule for the development of anticancer drugs.

INTRODUCTION

field of cancer therapy because both chemotherapy and
radiotherapy are based on DNA damage-induced tumor
cell death. However, activation of the DDR after treatment
with chemotherapeutic DNA-damaging agents or radiation
may promote tumor cell survival rather than induce cell
death, which reduces the effectiveness of these treatments.
This suggests inhibition of the DDR (cell cycle arrest and
DNA repair) could increase the efficacy of conventional
DNA-damaging agents.
Several small molecules that inhibit protein
kinases involved in the DDR have been developed and
characterized as chemosensitizers that could potentiate
the efficacy of conventional cancer therapies [3-7].

The maintenance of genomic integrity is essential
for survival. Thus, the DNA damage response (DDR),
which protects the genome from various insults, is highly
conserved and complex. Cell cycle arrest mechanisms and
DNA repair pathways are activated in response to DNA
damage. If the damage is too severe, cells harboring the
damaged DNA are removed from the organism through
the induction of cell death. The cellular responses to DNA
damage, which include DNA repair pathway activation,
cell cycle arrest, and cell death induction, are collectively
called the DDR [1, 2]. The DDR is important in the

For example, KU55933, a specific inhibitor of the
protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM),
which is a key player in the signaling pathways that are
activated following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs),
enhances the cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation (IR)
and DNA-damaging anticancer drugs (e.g., etoposide
[ETO], doxorubicin, and camptothecin) [8]. Other small
molecules, including UCN01, XL‑844, AZD7762 and PF0047736, which are inhibitors of the cell cycle checkpoint
kinases 1 and 2 (the gatekeepers of cell cycle progression),
have been developed as chemosensitizers and evaluated in
several clinical trials [4, 9-11]. In addition to sensitizationbased strategies, targeting the DDR in specific tumor cells
is highly effective. A specific inhibitor of poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP), important for single-strand
break (SSB) repair, can selectively kill tumor cells
carrying BRCA mutations but not normal cells [12-14].
Thus, the application of inhibitors that target the DDR is a
promising therapeutic strategy.
Several chemotherapeutic agents, including
bleomycin, ETO, doxorubicin and camptothecin, as well
as gamma irradiation, all induce DSBs, one of the most
severe forms of DNA damage. The DSBs induce activation
of ATM, which phosphorylates several downstream
substrates. One of the initial targets of ATM is histone
variant H2AX, which is phosphorylated on serine 139
at DSBs. Phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) recruits DDR
proteins to DSBs to elicit DNA repair [15, 16]. One of
DDR proteins is mediator of DNA-damage checkpoint
protein 1 (MDC1), which is phosphorylated by ATM and
binds γH2AX. MDC1 may serve as a platform for the
recruitment of other DDR proteins and ATM-dependent

amplification in response to DNA damage [17, 18]. It also
regulates the intra-S-phase checkpoint, G2/M checkpoint,
and mitotic progression [19-21]. Several studies have
shown that DDR core proteins (e.g., ATM, p53-binding
protein 1 [53BP1], and MDC1) are involved in both
DNA repair and the regulation of mitotic progression,
suggesting the processes are closely linked [22, 23]. Like
the DDR, the mitotic phase of tumor cells has become a
target for cancer therapy. Antimitotic drugs such as taxol,
which interferes with microtubule dynamics, cause mitotic
arrest and cell death [24].
We previously exploited the relationship between
γH2AX foci formation and the extent of DNA damage to
develop a quantitative cell-based high content screening
method to identify chemical inhibitors of the DDR. Using
this method, we screened a chemical library and identified
several inhibitors of γH2AX foci formation [25]. In this
study, we characterized DNA damage response inhibitor-9
(DDRI-9;
1H-Purine-2,6-dione,7-[(4-fluorophenyl)
methyl]-3,7-dihydro-3-methyl-8-nitro) and found that it
inhibits γH2AX foci formation upon DNA damage and
blocks mitotic progression.

RESULTS
DDRI-9 inhibits γH2AX foci formation
We previously established a high content screening
method based on quantitation of γH2AX foci to identify
small molecule inhibitors of the DDR and screened a

chemical library (provided by the Korea Chemical Bank)
containing 6,800 compounds. In an initial screen, 11
chemicals were identified that inhibited ETO-induced
γH2AX foci formation. Among these compounds, DDRI-9
was the most potent inhibitor of DDR [25]. We examined
whether DDRI-9 could inhibit γH2AX foci formation
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1A). U2OS cells
were pretreated with DDRI-9 for 1 h, exposed to 10
μM ETO for 1 h, fixed, and then immunostained with
an anti-γH2AX antibody. In the presence of 1 μM, 2.5
μM, and 5 μM DDRI-9, the γH2AX foci total area per
cell decreased from 74.51 ± 3.10 to 68.43 ± 1.67, 32.48
± 2.23, and 18.30 ± 1.54, respectively. After treatment
with 10 μM KU55933, a specific inhibitor of ATM that
phosphorylates H2AX, the γH2AX foci total area per cell
decreased from 74.51 ± 3.10 to 31.11 ± 5.08, similar to
the effect of 2.5 μM DDRI-9. We confirmed that DDRI-9
inhibited γH2AX foci formation after ETO treatment at a
lower concentration than KU55933. We also observed that
DDRI-9 inhibited ETO-induced γH2AX foci formation in
HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Figure
1). The chemical structure of DDRI-9 is similar to that
of caffeine (Figure 1B). Because caffeine is an inhibitor
of ATM and ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related
(ATR) kinase [26], we compared the inhibitory activity
of caffeine with that of DDRI-9. Caffeine inhibited ETOinduced γH2AX foci formation at higher concentrations
than DDRI-9 (Figure 2A).

BRCA1, and DNA-PK1 foci formation in response to
DSBs induced by ionizing radiation (IR). However,
the MDC1 foci count per cell increased in the presence
of DDRI-9 after IR (Figure 2B). Thus, DDRI-9 altered
DDR-related protein foci formation. In response to DSBs,
DDRI-9 inhibited the recruitment of most DDR-related
proteins (γH2AX, ATM, 53BP1, BRCA1, and DNAPK1) to DNA damage sites. However, MDC1 recruitment
increased.
We also examined whether DDRI-9 inhibited ATMdependent DDR signaling. Indeed, DDRI-9 inhibited
phosphorylation of ATM, Nijmegen breakage syndrome
gene (NBS1), BRCA1, checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), and
H2AX in DSB-induced ATM signaling (Figure 2C).

DDRI-9 inhibits DNA repair and ETO-induced
cell cycle arrest
We next examined whether DDRI-9 could disturb
DNA repair similar to KU55933. An alkaline comet assay
was performed to determine the extent of damaged DNA
(extent of tail DNA) after ETO treatment in the presence
and absence of DDRI-9. In the presence of vehicle
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the extent of tail DNA
was maximal 1 h after ETO treatment and decreased to
the basal level 3 h after ETO removal from the culture
medium. However, in the presence of DDRI-9, the
extent of tail DNA remained at high levels 3 h after ETO
removal, indicative of inefficient DNA damage repair.
KU55933-treated cells showed a pattern of tail DNA
after ETO removal that was similar to that observed with
DDRI-9 treatment (Figure 3A). These data suggested that
DDRI-9 inhibited DNA damage repair processes similar
to KU55933.
Because several DDR inhibitors are known
to interfere with DSB-induced cell cycle arrest, we
examined whether DDRI-9 could disturb ETO-induced
cell cycle arrest at the G2/M boundary. We performed
cell cycle analysis based on combined staining with an
anti-phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) antibody as a marker of
mitosis. Treatment of U2OS cells with 2 μM ETO caused
G2/M cell cycle arrest resulting in a reduced proportion of
phospho-histone H3-positive cells. However, when cells
were treated with ETO in combination with DDRI-9 or
KU55933, G2/M arrest was disturbed and the number of
phospho-histone H3-positive cells increased (Figure 3B).
These data indicated that DDRI-9 and KU55933 blocked
ETO-induced cell cycle arrest at G2.
Because several studies have suggested that DNA
repair inhibitors including KU55933 could enhance the
cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs, we tested whether DDRI9 could sensitize tumor cells to ETO. We performed a
clonogenic assay to measure U2OS cell viability after
ETO treatment in combination with DDRI-9, KU55933,
or DMSO as a vehicle control (Figure 3C). We determined

DDRI-9 alters recruitment of DDR-related
proteins onto DNA damage sites and inhibits
ATM-mediated DDR signaling pathways
In response to DSBs, autophosphorylated, active
ATM phosphorylates H2AX at sites of DNA damage.
Several DDR-related proteins such as MDC1, 53BP1,
breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1),
and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) are then
recruited to the DSBs. To characterize the inhibitory
effects of DDRI-9 on DDR, we examined whether it
affected recruitment of DDR-related proteins onto DNA
damage sites. Following treatment of U2OS cells with
ETO in the presence or absence of DDRI-9, we observed
foci formation of DDR-related proteins (γH2AX, ATM,
MDC1, 53BP1, BRCA1, and DNA-PK). In the presence
of DDRI-9, the extent of γH2AX, ATM, 53BP1, BRCA1,
and DNA-PK foci formation decreased as expected, but
MDC1 foci formation increased (Figure 2A). We then
evaluated the activities of KU55933 and caffeine, which
are inhibitors of the DDR. Both chemicals inhibited foci
formation of DDR-related proteins including MDC1.
DDRI-9 treatment also increased MDC1 foci formation
after ETO treatment in HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells
(Supplementary Figure 1). By confocal microscope
analysis, DDRI-9 inhibited γH2AX, ATM, 53BP1,

that U2OS cells were more sensitive to ETO in the
presence DDRI-9 and KU55933, and DDRI-9 enhanced
the cytotoxicity of ETO in HeLa cells (Supplementary
Figure 2A). Additionally, DDRI-9 rendered U2OS and
HeLa cells more sensitive to IR (Supplementary Figure
2B). These data indicated that DDRI-9 increased the
sensitivity of various tumor cells to anticancer drugs,
similar to the effects of inhibitors of DNA damage repair.

Because treatment with ETO and either DDRI-9 or
KU55933 increased phospho-histone H3-positive cells
(Figure 3B), we examined whether DDRI-9 or KU55933
alone could affect the percentage of these cells. Although
KU55933 treatment alone had no effect, DDRI-9 treatment
alone increased the proportion of phospho-histone H3-

positive cells (Figure 4A). Since the accumulation of
phospho-histone H3-positive cells is indicative of defects
in mitotic progression, we determined whether DDRI-9
could block mitotic progression, similar to the actions of
taxol, nocodazole, and colchicine. Flow cytometric data
demonstrated that DDRI-9 increased the percentage of
phospho-histone H3-positive cells to a similar extent as
these other antimitotic drugs. In contrast, caffeine did not
block mitotic progression, even though it has a similar
chemical structure to DDRI-9, (Figure 4B).

In addition, we found that DDRI-9 increased the
percentage of phospho-histone H3-positive cells in other
cell lines (HeLa, HCT116, MDA-MB-231, and Jurkat)
(Supplementary Figure 3). Similar to taxol, DDRI9 treatment increased the levels of the mitotic kinase
Aurora A (Figure 4C). These data indicated that DDRI9 blocked mitotic progression. Because DDRI-9 was
identified as a DDR inhibitor, we examined whether taxol
and nocodazole also inhibited DDR. However, neither
chemical prevented DDR-related protein foci formation

following treatment with ETO (Supplementary Figure 4).
Taken together, these data indicate that DDRI-9 inhibited
both DDR and mitotic progression, activities that are
distinct from those of other mitotic and DDR inhibitors.

U2OS cells were exposed to a serial dose of DDRI-9 or
antimitotic drugs (taxol and nocodazole) for 48 h were
performed. DDRI-9 alone induced U2OS cell death but
was less cytotoxic than the antimitotic drugs (Figure 5A).
In addition, we observed DDRI-9 cytotoxicity in various
cell lines (HeLa, HCT116, HT29, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, SK-BR3, and A549 cells), with varying LD50 values
(Supplementary Table 1).
We next investigated whether DDRI-9-induced
cell death was due to apoptosis. We evaluated markers of
apoptosis (annexin V-positive cells and PARP cleavage).
Based on flow cytometric analysis, the proportion of cells
that were annexin V-positive increased in DDRI-9-treated

DDRI-9 induces cell death through apoptosis
Because antimitotic drugs induce cell death by
interfering with mitotic spindle microtubule dynamics
in proliferating cells, they have been used to target
proliferating tumor cells. To determine whether DDRI9 could induce cytotoxicity, MTT assays in which

U2OS cells compared to DMSO-treated cells (from 6.0%
in DMSO vehicle-treated cells to 18.1% in DDRI-9-treated
cells) (Figure 5B). Cleaved PARP was detected in DDRI9-treated cells by Western blotting (Figure 5C). To confirm
whether DDRI-9-induced cell death was due to caspasedependent apoptosis, we pretreated U2OS cells with the
pan-caspase inhibitor Q-Val-Asp-OPh (Q-VD-Oph) prior
to treatment with DDRI-9. In the presence of Q-VD-OPh,
DDRI-9-induced cell death decreased significantly (Figure
5D). DDRI-9 was also capable of inducing cell death in
HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure 5). These data indicated
that DDRI-9 alone could induce tumor cell death, which
could be partially attributed to apoptosis.

mitotic arrest in HeLa cells. DDRI-9 may block mitotic
progression by inhibiting the mitotic functions of MDC1.
We therefore hypothesized that DDRI-9 targeted MDC1 or
factors downstream of MDC1 in DDR signaling pathways.
To test our hypothesis, we evaluated the inhibitory activity
of DDRI-9 in MDC1-depleted cells. We found that
depletion of MDC1 by siRNA resulted in inhibition of
DDR (decreased γH2AX foci formation) and blockage of
mitotic progression (increased mitotic cells) as previously
reported. However, DDRI-9 treatment of MDC1-depleted
cells did not result in additive inhibitory effects (data not
shown). This raised the possibility that MDC1 was a target
of DDRI-9.
To biochemically define the target using biotinylated
DDRI-9, we attempted to determine the structure-activity
relationship of DDRI-9 and identify the possible biotinlinking sites. However, all 215 derivatives tested (provided
by the Korea Chemical Bank) failed to show inhibitory
activity toward the DDR and mitotic progression. Thus,
we could not determine a proper biotin-linking site for
DDRI-9. We also performed co-immunoprecipitation
experiments to identify the targets of DDRI-9. Lysates
from DDRI-9-treated cells were immunoprecipitated
with specific antibodies against candidate DDRI-9 targets
such as MDC1 and ATM, and the presence of DDRI-9
analyzed by mass spectrometry. DDRI-9 was not detected
by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry or matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass
spectrometry, possibly due to the poor ionization of the
compound or changes in the chemical structure. We were
therefore unable to confirm that MDC1 was a target of
DDRI-9.
The majority of DNA-damaging agents induce
tumor cell death through apoptosis. Cell death induced by
DDRI-9 was due to apoptosis because it was accompanied
by phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure (an increase in
annexin V-positive cells) and increased PARP cleavage,
which are hallmarks of apoptosis. Inhibition of cell death
by treatment with Q-VD-OPh revealed that DDRI-9induced cell death was caspase-dependent. It is not likely
that apoptotic cell death is the sole mechanism of DDRI9-induced cell death, because annexin V-positive cells
and cleaved PARP were not significantly increased, and
most populations of DDRI-9-treated cells could not be
recovered after treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor
Q-VD-OPh (Figure 5). We therefore examined whether
DDRI also induced cell death through non-apoptotic
mechanisms. Indeed, DDRI-9 treatment increased LC3 II
conversion and LC3 puncta (autophagosomes), which are
hallmarks of autophagy [28]. However, pharmacological
inhibition of autophagy with 3-methylamine and
chloroquine did not inhibit DDRI-9-induced cell death
in U2OS cells (data not shown). Additionally, treatment
with necrostatin, an inhibitor of necroptosis, did not inhibit
DDRI-9-induced cell death (data not shown). These data
indicated that DDRI-9-induced cell death was due to

DISCUSSION
We previously developed a cell-based high content
screening method using γH2AX foci quantitation to
identify DDR inhibitors [25]. A novel DDR inhibitor,
DDRI-18, was identified that delayed resolution of
γH2AX foci, inhibited the DDR, and potentiated the
cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents [27]. In this study,
we characterized DDRI-9, another novel DDR inhibitor,
and found that it competently inhibited γH2AX foci
formation and delayed DNA repair processes after DSBs.
In addition, DDRI-9 potentiated the cytotoxicity of ETO,
a DNA damage-inducing agent. These results indicated
that DDRI-9 could act as a typical DDR inhibitor, similar
to the ATM kinase inhibitor KU55933 (Figures 1 and 3).
However, DDRI-9 exerted slightly different inhibitory
effects than KU55933 on the recruitment of DDRrelated proteins to DNA damage sites. Following DSBs,
foci formation by most DDR-related proteins examined
(γH2AX, ATM, 53BP1, BRCA1, and DNA-PK) was
inhibited by DDRI-9 treatment, similar to the effects of
KU55933 treatment. However, foci formation by MDC1
increased after DDRI-9 treatment (Figure 2A). MDC1
functions as a platform for the recruitment of DDR-related
proteins and amplifies ATM-dependent DDR signaling
[17]. Recruitment of MDC1 to sites of DNA damage was
concomitant with the recruitment of the DDR-related
proteins. Thus, the opposite effects of DDRI-9 after DNA
DSBs (a reduction in the foci formation of DDR-related
proteins and an increase in the foci formation of MDC1)
suggest that DDRI-9 could abrogate the ATM-dependent
DDR signaling pathway at or downstream of MDC1.
We hypothesized that DDRI-9 binding might
induce a conformational change in MDC1 that facilitates
recruitment onto sites of DNA damage independent
of γH2AX. A conformational change in MDC1 could
prevent binding to phospho-ATM and result in a failure
of amplification of ATM-dependent DDR signaling. In
light of this hypothesis, it was interesting that DDRI-9
blocked mitotic progression (Figure 4), because a previous
report indicated that MDC1 regulated mitotic progression
[21]. In this study, siRNA knockdown of MDC1 caused

apoptosis and not autophagy or necroptosis. It is possible
that mitotic catastrophe induction is the major mechanism
underlying DDRI-9-induced cell death. This is because
DDRI-9 induces mitotic arrest and mitotic catastrophe is
considered to be cell death initiated by aberrant mitosis
[29]. However, whether mitotic catastrophe should
be categorized as a bona fide cell death mechanism is
controversial [30].
In conclusion, we identified a novel chemical
compound, DDRI-9, that inhibits both the DDR and
mitosis. This compound not only potentiated the efficacy
of anticancer drugs, but also induced tumor cell death.
The exact mechanisms of action of DDRI-9 are not yet
clear. Thus, further studies are required to enhance our
understanding of the connection between the DDR and
mechanisms of mitotic arrest. Ultimately, this could lead
to the development of novel anticancer drugs. Recent
studies have emphasized the close relationship between
DDR and mitotic checkpoint mechanisms. For example,
ATM is activated during mitosis by Aurora B kinase and
phosphorylates the mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine
protein kinase Bub1, resulting in the inhibition of the
anaphase-promoting complex and regulation of mitotic
progression into anaphase [31]. Characterization of the
mechanisms of action of DDRI-9 may reveal a novel
therapeutic target.

each. Non-specific binding was blocked by incubating
the cells with 1% BSA and 0.02% Triton X-100 in PBS
for 30 min at RT. The cells were sequentially incubated
at RT with the primary antibodies (1:500 dilutions) for

than five fields per well were collected to obtain data
for 200-400 cells. The filter sets used for detection of
the Hoechst 33342 and Alexa Fluor® 488 signals were
D360/40 (excitation)-HQ535/50 (emission) and D475/20
(excitation)-HQ 535/20 (emission), respectively. The
images were analyzed using the Multi Target Analysis
(MTA) module of the IN Cell Analyzer 1000 Workstation
software (v3.4). The MTA module measured the
fluorescence intensity and area (μm2) of nuclei (based
on Hoechst 33342 staining) and targeted foci (based on
Alexa Fluor® 488 staining). The fluorescence area of
Alexa Fluor® 488 represented γH2AX foci. We previously
reported that the foci total area per cell was well correlated
with the extent of DNA damage [25, 27].

U2OS, HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and HCT116 cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Hyclone, South Logan, UT, USA) and 2 mM
glutamine at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Comet assay

with PBS and 100 μL of MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, 0.5 mg/mL]
was added. After incubation at 37°C for 2 h in a 5% CO2
environment, insoluble crystals were completely dissolved
in DMSO. The absorbance at 540 nm was measured using
a VersaMax™ Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

The comet assay was performed under alkaline
conditions according to the Trevigen CometAssay® kit
manual (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Cells treated with
chemical compounds and ETO and were harvested at
the indicated time points. A total of 5 x 102 cells in 5 μL
of PBS was mixed with 50 μL of low melting agarose,
placed onto a CometSlide™, solidified at 4°C for 10
min, immersed in lysis solution at 4°C for 40 min, and
electrophoresed at 21 volts for 30 min in alkaline buffer
(300 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA) in the dark. The slides
were then immersed in distilled water followed by 70%
ethanol and then dried. DNA was stained with ethidium
bromide and analyzed using KOMET 5.5 software
(Kinetic Imaging, Ltd., Nottingham, UK).

Detection of mitotic cells using an anti-phosphohistone H3 (Ser10) antibody
Cells were fixed with 1% formalin on ice for 15 min,
washed with PBS, and then fixed with cold 70% ethanol
at -20°C for at least 30 min. After fixation, the cells
were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.25%
TritonX-100 in PBS on ice for 5 min. The cells were
sequentially incubated at RT with 1 μg of anti-phosphohistone H3 (Ser10; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 1 h,
Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody
(Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 30 min, and
propidium iodide (PI, 10 µg/mL) for 20 min at RT in the
dark. Finally, the cells were analyzed using FACSCaliber™
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).

Clonogenic assay
Cells were seeded at a density of 100-200 cells per
well in a six-well plate and exposed to anticancer drugs
and DDRI-9 at the indicated concentrations for 48 h. The
cells were then incubated in drug-free medium for 7-10
days until colonies (50 cells per colony) were visualized.
Following incubation, colonies were fixed and stained
with Diff-Quick (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan).

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean values ± SEM. All
statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism®
version 5.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
Comparisons between two groups were performed using
the Student’s t-test for unpaired data. Differences between
groups were considered statistically significant if P < 0.05.

Western blotting
Cell lysates were prepared by suspending 4 x
105 cells in 100 µL of Tris-Glycine SDS sample buffer
containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (Novex, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). The cell lysates were incubated on ice for 10
min and then boiled at 95°C for 5 min. Equal amounts
of total protein were separated on a 4-12% gradient or
a 10% or 15% Tris-Glycine PAGE and then transferred
to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA). After blocking with 5% skim milk in TBST [20
mM Tris (pH 7.5), 135 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20],
the membranes were incubated with the indicated primary
antibodies, washed with TBST, and then incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or antimouse IgG antibodies (1:5000 dilutions; Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). After extensive
washing with TBST, the proteins were visualized
by chemiluminescence using the ECL reagent (GE
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).
