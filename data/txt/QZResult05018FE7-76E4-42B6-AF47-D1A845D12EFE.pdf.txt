ABSTRACT
Brain metastasis is a devastating problem in patients with breast, lung and melanoma
tumors. GRP94 and FN14 are predictive biomarkers over-expressed in primary breast
carcinomas that metastasized in brain. To further validate these brain metastasis biomarkers,
we performed a multicenter study including 318 patients with breast carcinomas. Among
these patients, there were 138 patients with metastasis, of whom 84 had brain metastasis.
The likelihood of developing brain metastasis increased by 5.24-fold (95%CI 2.83–9.71) and
2.55- (95%CI 1.52–4.3) in the presence of FN14 and GRP94, respectively. Moreover, FN14
was more sensitive than ErbB2 (38.27 vs. 24.68) with similar specificity (89.43 vs. 89.55)
to predict brain metastasis and had identical prognostic value than triple negative patients
(p < 0.0001). Furthermore, we used GRP94 and FN14 pathways and GUILD, a networkbased disease-gene prioritization program, to pinpoint the genes likely to be therapeutic
targets, which resulted in FN14 as the main modulator and thalidomide as the best scored
drug. The treatment of mice with brain metastasis improves survival decreasing reactive
astrocytes and angiogenesis, and down-regulate FN14 and its ligand TWEAK. In conclusion

our results indicate that FN14 and GRP94 are prediction/prognosis markers which open up
new possibilities for preventing/treating brain metastasis.

Patients with ErbB2-positive or TNBC have an
increased risk of BrM development [20, 21]. A recent study
reported that both basal-like and claudin-low breast cancers
exhibited a high probability of metastasizing to the brain and
lung, while ErbB2-enriched tumors preferentially colonized
the liver [12]. It has been observed that active WNT/b-catenin
signaling contributes to the metastasis of basal breast tumors to
the brain, whereas the absence of WNT/beta-catenin signaling
allows luminal B-type tumors to metastasize to bone [13].
Moreover, a 13-gene signature predicting rapid development
of brain metastases in patients with ErbB2-positive advanced
breast cancer may be useful in the design of preventive
therapies [19]. We identifiedan expression signature based
on breast cancer BrM cells mapped onto an experimental
protein–protein interaction network, which found 37 proteins
differentially expressed in brain metastases [23]. The
combination of GRP94, FN14 and TRAF2 expression, and
the absence of Inhibin in breast carcinomas, referred to as the
endoplasmic reticulum stress resistance phenotype (ERSRP),
was the best signature for discriminating between breast
carcinomas according to their BrM progression, regardless of
whether or not they expressed ErbB-2 [24].
Bearing in mind that metastasis could already be
underway at the time of diagnosis [25], ERSRP provides a
predictive tool to help decide on treatment under the risk of
BrM progression. We performed a multicenter study with
breast carcinomas provided from three different hospitals
and assessed ERSRP expression in tissue microarrays to
independently validate it. Over-expression of GRP94 and
FN14 in primary breast cancer was confirmed as a BrM
predictor and the presence of FN14 and GRP94 in pairs
of tumor/brain metastasis of lung and clear cell kidney
carcinomas suggest that this phenotype might indicate
BrM in tumors from different tissues. Moreover, we used
bioinformatics tools such as BIANA [26] and GUILD [27]
to prioritize genes implicated in BCBrM progression, and
based on the network topology we assessed the level of
association of genes with BCBrM (GUILD scores). We
then ranked drugs using the GUILD score of their targets
and produced a list of candidate drugs with high therapeutic
potential, which were validated in preclinical experiments.
Moreover, the preliminary experimental results suggested
that the therapeutic activity of thalidomide derivatives might
be dependent on brain organspecific microenvironmental
factors produced by reactive astrocytes.

INTRODUCTION
Brain metastasis (BrM) occurs mainly after the
diagnosis of systemic metastases in up to 30% of cancer
patients [1, 2]. Despite the improvement in systemic
therapies and the availability of more frequent imaging,
central nervous system (CNS) relapse is emerging as an
increasing clinical problem in up to 40% of cancer patients
[3, 4]. The mean survival of these patients is 7 months
[5, 6], posing CNS relapse a key research challenge.
The cross-subtype comparison involving both wet-lab
and clinical studies reflects the heterogeneity of carcinomas
to brain metastasis progression [7]. It is now recognized that
breast cancer is composed of several subtypes [8–10]. The
large numbers of differentially expressed genes in the five
molecular subtypes of breast carcinoma confirm the diversity
of the underlying biology [11]. These biomarkers include
the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR),
and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2 or
HER2). ER and PR positivity define Luminal tumors A and
B, whereas ErbB2 expression occurs in hormone positive and
in negative tumors and basal tumors are characterized by the
absence of these biomarkers. Moreover, the clear differences
in metastatic potential between subtypes raise the question
as to whether some tumors are “hardwired” to metastasize
to the brain [12, 13]. Known predictive factors for BrM are:
(i) overexpression of ErbB2, (ii) lack of hormone receptor
expression, (iii) triple-negative subtype (TNBC) with ER
and PR-negative and normal ErbB2, (iv) patient age under
50 years and (v) the presence of positive regional lymph
nodes and lung metastases [14, 15]. The basal subtype has
the worst prognosis (3–4 months) and ErbB2-negative/
hormone receptor positive disease has the best prognosis
(over 20 months). In a retrospective series of metastatic breast
carcinoma (MBC) patients treated with trastuzumab, 52% of
them succumbed to CNS progression although the non-CNS
disease was stable or responsive [16].
Different primary tumor types exhibit remarkable
differences in developing BrM. Both small cell and non-small
cell lung carcinomas, kidney cancer and melanoma are the
principal tumors with brain metastasis ability [3]. Alterations
in the expression of several genes, including ST6GALNAC5,
transforming growth factor-β, vascular endothelial growth
factor, Serpine 1 and Timp 1 have been implicated in brain
metastasis [17]. In lung cancer the genes mostly associated
with brain metastasis are EGFR, KRAS mutation at codon
12 and several chromosomal imbalances [18].
Therefore, understanding the properties of brain-trophic
tumor cells is essential to identify patients with risk of brain
metastasis and to effectively prevent it [19]. A research priority
is to delineate pathogenic mechanisms of metastasis to the
brain that would enable the heterogeneity among tumors to
differentiate between indolent and aggressive lesions.

included patient characteristics and biological features of
tumors such as ER negativity, ErbB2 positivity, a large
primary tumor and loss of histopathological differentiation
[35]. Among clinical parameters the presence of lymphnode metastasis is intrinsic to establishing the breast cancer
prognosis [36]. We took all of these parameters into account
when evaluating the contribution of the previously defined
breast cancer brain metastasis biomarkers (BCBrMBK):
GRP94, TRAF2, FN14 and Inhibin [24].
The overexpression of BCBrMBK was categorized as
positive when strong expression was detected in more than
70% of tumor cells (Figure 1A). On this basis, GRP94 was
overexpressed in 48.2% (151/313), FN14 in 17.9% (55/308)
and TRAF2 in 31.4% (97/309) of tumors. Inhibin expression,
which was inversely associated with brain metastasis
progression, was found in only 3.57% (11/308) of samples.
The variation in the denominators is the result of taking into
account the missing values in the immunohistochemistry
data (tissue lost, unviable staining, background, etc.).
We first analyzed the association between the
overexpression of proteins and the clinico-pathological
features of the patients (Table 1). Patients with infiltrated
axillary lymph nodes overexpressed GRP94 (Chi-square
test, p = 0.049), whereas tumors with a high histological
grade (III) were associated with FN14 expression (Chisquare test p = 0.004). The expression of both markers was
associated with ErbB2 positivity (p = 0.013 and p = 0.005,
respectively). Moreover, the expression of biomarkers was
not associated with hormone receptors. The combination
of negative hormone receptors and ErbB2 expression in
TNBC patients was independent from the expression of
GRP94 (p = 0.481) and FN14 (p = 0.914).
Statistical analysis of the data showed significant
associations between BrM progression and high
expression of GRP94 (p = 0.0004) and FN14 (p < 0.0001).
The expression of TRAF2 was marginally associated with
brain metastasis (p = 0.084). Inhibin was not correlated
with BrM relapse (p= 0.428).
As expected, the ErbB2 expression detected in
14.4% (42/292) of patients (26 missing values) was
significantly associated with BrM (p = 0.003): 24.7%
(19/77) of breast cancers that progressed to brain metastasis
were positive versus 12.8% (6/47) and 10.1% (17/168) of
breast carcinomas that relapsed in other locations (such as
lung, liver, bone or non-regional lymph nodes) or without
metastasis, respectively. The incidence of BrM in patients
with hormone receptors that expressed ErbB2 was 11.5%.
A total of 15.5% (46/297) of patients (21 missing
values) were triple-negative (TNBC) with an increased
risk of BrM progression (p < 0.0001). The incidence of
BrM in this group was 58.7% (27/46); 15.2% (7/46) of
patients had non-brain metastasis (lung, liver, bone or nonregional lymph nodes) and 26.1% (12/46) of patients did
not progress to metastasis (p < 0.0001).
We found no correlation between lung, bone or liver
metastasis and high levels of expression of BCBrMBK.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The overexpression of GRP94 in patients who
developed brain metastasis was 65.1% (54/83), whereas
GRP94 overexpression was found in 42.2% (97/230)
in the other and non-metastasis group. FN14 was
overexpressed in 38.3% (31/81) of brain metastasis relapse
patients and only in 10.6% (24/227) of the others and
non-metastasis group. The variation in the denominators
is the result of taking into account the missing values of
clinicopathological data.
The multivariate analysis comparing samples from
patients who relapsed in the brain versus those who
relapsed in other organs and without metastasis, indicated
that the likelihood of relapse in patients with GRP94positive tumors was 2.55-fold higher (95% CI 1.52–4.3,
p = 0.0003) and increased to up to 5.24-fold higher
(95% CI 2.83–9.71, p < 0.0001) if the tumors expressed
FN14 (Table II). The combination of both markers was
significantly associated to brain metastasis (p = 0.0014).
These results indicated the predictive potential of both
molecules for establishing the risk associated with a
tumor that shows these characteristics. The overexpression
of TRAF2 in tumors was associated with a 1.60-fold
increased likelihood of relapse in the brain, although this
increase was not significant (p = 0.086).
When multivariate analysis was corrected by the
covariables tumor size, histological grade, lymph nodes,
hormone receptors, ErbB2, therapy (adjuvant chemotherapy
and hormones), the best predictive markers for the presence
of BrM were FN14 (p < 0.0001) followed by GRP94
(p = 0.0017). These results confirmed the independence of
both biomarkers from the classical categorization of breast
carcinomas and from the five breast cancer subtypes, and
reinforce their intrinsic value as biomarkers for predicting
BrM relapse, whereas TRAF2 and Inhibin were no longer
significant (p = 0.481 and p = 0.736, respectively).
A multivariate analysis based on stepwise logistic
regression retained GRP94 and FN14 as the best
combination for predicting brain metastasis (Figure 1B).
We calculated the positive and negative likelihood ratios to
assess the predictive accuracy of each molecule as a BrM
marker, considering the sensitivity and specificity of each.
GRP94 was the most sensitive (0.65) and FN14 the most
specific (0.89), and the combination of both increased the
predictability of brain metastasis risk (AUC = 0.69) above
that ascribed to ErbB2 overexpression (AUC = 0.57).
Since FN14 had better sensitivity than ErbB2 (38.27%
vs. 24.68%), the additional information on ErbB2 status
did not improve the prediction of BrM in breast cancer
patients (AUC = 0.69). Therefore, the expression of FN14
in primary tumors was by far the strongest predictor of
the likelihood of BrM in breast cancer patients and could
be used to stratify patients according to their risk of
developing BrM, both for therapeutic decision making at
first diagnosis and to indicate preventive treatments.
GRP94 and FN14 were also expressed in tumor
metastasis brain pairs from non-small cell lung carcinoma

tumors FN14 expression might be only circumscribed to a
subtype from those which develop brain metastasis.

also had a significantly shorter BrM-free survival than
patients whose tumors did not expressed the protein. These
results confirmed that FN14 and GRP94 have prognostic
value as widely accepted breast cancer prognostic markers.
Since adjuvant therapy is selected according to the
biological features of the primary tumor, and as long-term
efficacy implies the lack of disease relapse, we assessed
whether FN14 and GRP94 predicted the response to
adjuvant therapy by evaluating overall survival (Figure
2B). Interestingly, patients treated with taxanes survived
a shorter period with regard to other therapeutic regimens
(upper-left panel) when tumors expressed FN14 (16/37,
p = 0.048). In contrast, the survival of patients with FN14negative tumors (upper-right panel) was similar in those
treated with taxanes or with other therapeutic regimens
(36/150, p = 0.360). These results show that FN14
predicted taxane protocol failure in breast cancer patients,
suggesting a relationship between FN14 expression and
the shortening of BrM-free survival (p = 0.066) in patients
treated with taxanes (bottom-left panel). In contrast, BrMfree survival was not associated with the therapeutic
protocol in patients with FN14-negative tumors (bottomright panel).
The association between FN14 expression and
the efficacy of taxanes against breast cancer in vivo was

BrM-free survival (Figure 2A), the number of months

metastasis, and we correlated with patients according to
whether the tumors were TNBC (bottom-right panel) or
expressed ErbB2 (bottom-left panel), FN14 (upper-left
panel) or GRP94 (upper-right panel). Patients with FN14positive tumors (81/308, 10 deleted due to missingness),
Figure 2A, had a shorter BrM-free survival than patients
with negative tumors (p < 0.0001) and 31 developed brain
metastasis; similar to that of TNBC patients (77/301, p <
0.0001). Patients with ErbB2-positive tumors (77/297, p =
0.002) and GRP94-positive tumors (83/313, p = 0.002)

explored by performing experiments with two TNBC
breast cancer xenografts obtained from breast cancer
patients that expressed (TNBC-EG) or did not express
(TNBC-1070) FN14 (Supplementary Figure S1A, right
panel and left panel, respectively). Although docetaxel
treatment diminished the growth of tumors with regard
to controls after 15 days of treatment in both models
(Supplementary Figure S1B), the rate of increase of the
tumor volume was reduced only 50% (p = 0.003) in FN14positive tumors, whereas the rate of increase was reduced
by 85% (p < 0.001) in FN14–negative tumors with regard
to the control.
The survival of patients given adjuvant treatments,
either taxanes or other chemotherapeutic protocols
(Supplementary Figure S2), was not correlated with
GRP94 expression in tumors, whether positive (N = 98) or
negative (N = 92), p = 0.31 and p = 0.29, respectively. These
results indicate GRP94 and FN14 are involved in different
pathways and functions in BrM progression, suggesting that
both biomarkers might be therapeutically inhibited.

thus early breast cancer assessment with tools for prognosis
and prediction of treatment benefit may aid clinical decision
making. Indeed, an important question is how to identify
the specific adjuvant interventions that would improve the
prognosis of BC patients with risk of BrM progression. Since
the pathophenotype is the outcome of perturbations in the
underlying regulatory pathways, we designed experiments
to highlight the usefulness of BCBrMBK expression in
choosing the most appropriate adjuvant therapy.
We have previously cataloged the organ-specific
metastasis signature (BOSMS) with a hierarchical
clustering containing 1,193 genes after one-versus-all
(ONA) class comparisons, which clearly distinguished
between the different metastases [40]. These datasets,
under the identification number GSE11078, are freely
available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
repository. The BOSMS mapped human brain metastasis
expression profiles with a PPIN to maximize accuracy
in the classification of brain metastasis proteins and
permitted the identification of protein folding and
chaperones connecting different functions and performing
the endoplasmic reticulum stress resistance phenotype
(ERSRP) [24]. Indeed, rather than having random
connections through the network, the interaction of
proteins encoded by genes implicated in such phenotypes
involves partners from similar diseases [26]. We used these

and regulating the function of the BBB in the EC-BMastrocyte interface [44].
To analyze if LND can impair FN14/TWEAK
in vivo, we performed experiments to inhibit BrM growth
in a classical model of brain metastasis [30], where the
proprietary cells BRV5eGFP-CMV/Luc (BrV5), obtained
from 435Br1 cells by in vivo/in vitro selection, were
injected intra-cranially by stereotaxia to homogenize the
groups of treatment. The cellular burden was followed by
luminescence to assess the volume slope of intracranial
masses in animals treated with the vehicle or with a
thalidomide derivative lenalidomide (LND), the weight of
the animals was monitored three times a week (m-w-f) and
the bioluminescence analysis was done twice a week (m-f)
until the symptoms of metastasis appeared. The differences
observed in the increasing rate of bioluminescence
between the two groups (treated or not with LND) were
not statistically significant (Student test, p = 0,39), due
in part to the heterogenic growth of cells (Figure 4A).
In addition, we analyzed mice survival and the results
showed moderate differences (Figure 4B) between treated
and non-treated mice (p = 0.080). The IHC analysis of
brain tissues showed that LND decreased the expression
of FN14 in tumoral cells (Figure 4C).
These results fit with the survival of 435Br1 cells
stimulated with TWEAK (Supplementary Figure S3A
and S3B), which increased with regard to parental cells,
suggesting the high functionality of the FN14/TWEAK
pathway. Moreover, we found an IC50 > 100 μM when
challenged 435Br1 cells with LND. Therefore, LND
does not exert in vitro cytotoxicity against carcinoma
cells, as was the case in human myeloma cell lines
challenged in vitro with the cell-extrinsic component of
the antineoplastic activity of LND, which prevails over
its cell-intrinsic counterpart [45]. In contrast, 435Br1
cells overexpressed GRP94 (Supplementary Figure S4A),
and the heat shock protein inhibitor (NVP-AUY922)
[46] was highly cytotoxic and the IC50 was 10–20 nM
(Supplementary Figure S4B).

Targeting FN14 with thalidomide derivatives
improves brain metastasis outcome in preclinical
experimental models
Since GUILD retrieved FN14 as the main
regulator of BrM protein-protein interacting network, we
hypothesized that thalidomide therapy could impair FN14/
TWEAK function in the BrM.
It is well known that FN14 belongs to the TNFR
family and is activated by its specific ligand TWEAK
and by TNFα [42]. Among other cytokines TWEAK
is expressed in brain, mainly produced by astrocytes
and microglial cells [43]. The binding of TWEAK to
FN14 has a direct effect on the composition of the basal
lamina (BL) and on the perivascular astrocytes (PA),
regulating their interaction with endothelial cells (EC)

We analyzed the contribution of the CNS micro­
environment in brain metastasis from treated and
control mice. The expression of reactive astrocytes
around cancer cells diminished together with the
down regulation of TWEAK and CD31 expression in
treated mice with regard to controls (Figure 4D). These
results indicated that LND had a microenvironmental
action in BrM that can involve astrocyte response and
angiogenesis.

and control mice was similar (NVP-AUY922 vs. CTR,
p = 0.351). Reactive astrocytes decreased according to the
expression of GFAP in NVP-AUY922 + LND with regard
to NVP alone (Figure 4G). These results suggested that the
therapeutic effect of LND might contribute to the success of
adjuvant treatment by decreasing reactive astrocytes and/or
modifying the BBB penetration [44].
In addition, to avoid BBB permeability maintaining
the stromal and phenotypic characteristic of brain
metastasis tissue, we treated a group of mice with a
subcutaneously engrafted brain metastasis biopsy, which
expressed both GRP94 and FN14 proteins, obtained
from a woman with primary lung carcinoma that
metastasized in the brain. We compared tumor growth
in mice treated with LND, docetaxel and NVP-AUY922
alone or in combination with LND (Figure 4H). LND
alone (p = 0.046) reduced the engrafted brain metastasis
in mice, even more in combination with docetaxel (p =
0.004), in contrast to docetaxel alone (p = 0.179). These
preliminary results showed that LND might improve
therapy responses in brain metastatic tissue. Moreover,
NVP-AUY922 decreased graft development alone (p =
0.006) and in combination with LND (p = 0.004). In this
case the high cytotoxicity of the drug is manifested when
BBB is avoided.
These preliminary results suggested that the action
of thalidomide derivatives could impair FN14/TWEAK
axis through its reactive astrocytes activity. In fact,
LND did not reduce the tumor slope of i.m.f.p. breast
cancer tumors induced with EG and 1070 TNBC breast
carcinomas (Supplementary Figure S5), even thought
decreased the expression of FN14 positive EG tumors,
probably intercepting other stromal cytokines production.

will develop brain metastasis, either in ErbB2 or TNBC
patients.
FN14 positivity was associated with ErbB2
expression in our series, consistent with reports
that high FN14 expression levels were significantly
correlated with several poor prognostic indicators, being
higher particularly in ErbB2-positive breast cancer
[49]. Moreover, FN14 positive tumors might have a
poor survival because they are likely to develop brain
metastasis. On the other hand, GRP94 correlates with
ErbB2 expression and poor BrM free survival of breast
cancer patients. Indeed, GRP94 specific inhibitors
provided evidence for the role of GRP94 in maintaining
the architecture of high-density ErbB2 formations at
the plasma membrane, which is vital for proper ErbB2
functioning [50].
FN14 is a small cell-surface protein that might
modulate cell–extracellular matrix interactions, the
expression of which is frequently found to be strongly
enhanced in tumor tissue compared to non-transformed
tissue [49]. The tumor microenvironment typically
contains many factors implicated in the upregulation of
FN14 expression [51]. High FN14 has been found in
tissues damaged by different insults including hypoxia,
oxidative stress, chemical and mechanical injuries and
tumor growth [52]. Although the regulatory elements
involved in FN14 gene activation have not yet been
elucidated, the human FN14 promoter region contains
several potential transcription factor binding sites,
including AP-1 sites and the NFkB site [53]. RNA
interference-mediated inhibition of FN14 expression in
metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells reduces
invasion through activation of the NF-kB pathway [49].
Moreover, FN14 has been shown to promote breast cancer
cell migration, invasion and MMP9 expression [54].
These data illustrate the importance of FN14 expression
in mechanistic pathways of metastasis progression.
Brain colonization involves many factors implicated
in the upregulation of FN14 expression. Among them,
reactive astrocytes [55] represent a bona fide source of
TWEAK (TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis), its only
known signaling-competent receptor [51]. Further work
is required to unraveling the important role that FN14/
TWEAK axis in different pathogenic steps of brain
metastasis progression, including BBB permeability.
Consistent with the hypothesis that LND action
might involve the physical and tropic interaction between
cancer cells and the CNS environment, the treatment of
experimental brain metastasis resulted in a reduction in
tumor volume with reactive astrocytes and angiogenesi
decrease and down-regulation of FN14 and TWEAK
expression. A similar therapeutic effect has been reported
with the use of immunotoxins targeting the FN14 receptor
[56]. Indeed, a phase I study of RG7212, a humanized
anti-TWEAK IgG1k monoclonal antibody, was conducted
in patients with advanced solid tumors expressing FN14

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study is the first to report
that fibroblast growth factor-inducible protein 14 (FN14)
expression and GRP94 expression in a patient diagnosed
with breast cancer (BC) indicates a high risk of brain
metastasis (BrM) progression, offering the opportunity to
develop therapeutic strategies either to prevent the disease
or facilitate early detection. Moreover, other tumors like
lung carcinomas and clear cell kidney carcinomas might
express these biomarkers according their ability to develop
BrM.
The major challenge for both primary and
secondary prevention studies is the identification of
patients at highest risk of developing brain metastasis
due to tumor and host factors. For cancers of the breast,
BrM occurs after diagnosis of systemic metastases from
tumors belonging to one of two categories: tumors with
amplification of ErbB2 or TNBC; the incidence of both
exceeds one-third of patients [47, 48]. We demonstrate
that FN14 and GRP94 are independent prognostic factors
and give information on the likelihood that patients

resulting in tumor regression and prolonged stable disease
[57]. This is the first evidence of a specific treatment
against FN14/TWEAK that encourage the use of these
molecules as a therapeutic target to develop new drugs to
treat/prevent brain metastasis.
LND is a synthetic derivative of thalidomide currently
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use
in patients affected by multiple myeloma (in combination
with dexamethasone) and low or intermediate-1 risk
myelodysplastic syndromes that harbor 5q cytogenetic
abnormalities [58]. Therefore, our results illustrate a new
indication of LND for the treatment of brain metastasis
when the primary tumor expresses FN14. Pomalidomide
(CC4047) is a new thalidomide derivative with high in
vitro potency. A first phase 1b, single-center, ascending
dose study was conducted to identify the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate the safety and efficacy
of CC-4047 in relapsed or refractory LND-treated MM
patients (http://ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01311687,
and with EudraCT, number 2010–019820-30), showing
a significantly longer median overall survival time with
refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma patients [59].
BrM are remarkably heterogeneous in permeability
to the chemotherapeutic agents, typically undergo higher
levels of drug penetration than surrounding normal
tissue, but far lower levels of penetration than metastases
to other organs [60], due of drug efflux pumps for
chemotherapeutic and molecular therapeutic agents [17].
Since St Gallen Consensus [61] is indicating cytotoxic
drugs in TNBC, due to the limit distribution of taxanes
to subtherapeutic levels in brain, it could be beneficious
to treat FN14 positive tumors with drugs that have better
penetration to CNS. This consideration might prevent to
render the brain a ‘‘sanctuary site’’ for metastatic cells in
TNBC patients.
On the other hand, in all meta-analyses involving
taxane-based regimens or anthracycline-based regimens
[62], the proportional reductions in early recurrence, any
recurrence, and breast cancer mortality appeared largely
independent of age, nodal status, tumor diameter, tumor
differentiation (poorly or moderately differentiated,
relatively few were well differentiated) or ER status
(ER-poor or ER-positive). Indeed, for a patient with
early-stage breast cancer, recommendations regarding
systemic therapy and the most appropriate choice of
agent(s) are often difficult (Early Breast Cancer Trialists’
Collaborative Group (EBCTCG)). In this scenario, FN14
over-expression is an early event, which reflects specific
mechanisms of breast cancer progression, correlates with
clinico-pathological features and predicts BrM outcome
in patients treated with protocols including taxanes.
Therefore, FN14 combines prediction and prognostic
information to stratify patients at first diagnosis according
to the likelihood of BrM with accuracy similar to ErbB2,
and thus it might help clinicians in deciding the therapeutic
protocols to be adopted.

To date only ErbB2-positive breast cancer patients
have entered prevention trials to clarify the role of
lapatinib [63]. Most patients with BrM are suffering
from terminal cancer, and control of brain metastasis
is crucial for their quality of life. ErbB2-positive BC
has seen more therapeutic progress than TNBC. The
LANDSCAPE trial is a phase II study testing lapatinib
plus capecitabine in previously untreated BCBrM and was
positive for its primary endpoint, with 65.9% of patients
presenting a partial response. In the light of these results
we suggest that patients with triple-negative tumors and
pulmonary metastasis might be the most suitable group
for prospective trials investigating strategies for BrM
screening and prevention. Indeed, FN14 and GRP94 might
be a companion diagnostic markers that could identify
patients who are likely to respond to drugs interfering with
these specific targets.
Progress in treating brain metastases has been
hampered by a lack of model systems, a lack of human
tissue samples, and the exclusion of brain metastatic
patients from many clinical trials. The Response
Assessment in NeuroOncology (RANO) group has
recently published the endpoints and trial consideration in
brain metastases clinical trials [64]. This is clearly but the
beginning of such considerations.
BrM therapy faces the challenge of efficiently
targeting cancer cells or/and their supportive relationship
with the brain parenchyma. Nowadays, the treatment
armamentarium consists of a multimodality approach,
selected according to the patient’s symptoms and extent
of disease. A systemic therapy might even prevent brain
colonization altogether or at least arrest single cells
or micrometastases in the dormant state. The role of
thalidomide derivatives in preventing BrM progression is
an ongoing investigation in our laboratory, with a particular
focus on their hypothetical mechanism of action which
might be associated with the regulation of immunoreactive
astrocytes in the area surrounding BrM cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection
We recruited samples from 318 patients diagnosed
between 1989–2009 in three hospitals: 252 samples from
the Catalan Institute of Oncology (I.C.O.) – Hospital
Duran i Reynals and the Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge
(L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain); 24 samples from the
Consorci Hospitalari Parc Taulí (Sabadell, Spain) and
42 samples from I.C.O. – Hospital Universitari Germans
Trias i Pujol (Badalona, Spain). The patients were between
24–88 years old at diagnosis and 61% were diagnosed
when in/older than their fifties (mean: 55 years). Followup ranged from 8 to 146 months (mean: 76.6 months).
Metastasis relapse occurred in 43.4% (138/318) of
patients; of these, 84 patients (60.9%) developed BrM,

47 (34.1%) lung metastasis, 54 (39.1%) liver metastasis,
40 (29.0%) non-regional lymph node metastasis and 89
(64.5%) bone metastasis. Just over half (56.6%; 180/318)
of the patients had no metastatic progression after a
minimum follow-up of 5 years.
In terms of histological type, the ductal type was
identified in 94.1% (n = 299) of patients, followed by
lobular in 5% (n = 16), mucinous in 0.6% (n = 2) and
medullary in 0.3% (n = 1). Estrogen receptors (ER)
were analyzed in 304 patients, being positive in 74.7%
(n = 227); relevant data were missing in 14 patients.
Progesterone receptors (PR) were evaluated in 299
patients (missing in 19), being positive in 65.9% (n = 197).
ErbB2 scoring was obtained for 296 patients (22 cases
missing), only 14.2% (n = 42) of whom were positive.
The triple-negative status was analyzed in 302 patients (16
cases missing), with only 15.6% of them (n = 47) being
identified as triple-negative.
Sixty-three percent (193/307) received adjuvant
chemotherapy: schedules with CMF (n = 68), anthracyclines
(n = 32), anthracyclines plus CMF (n = 60), taxanes (n =
21) and anthracyclines plus taxanes (n = 12); 6 patients
were missing and 5 were not undergone to surgery. Only 3
patients received trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy. Twentynine percent (91/314) of patients received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and adjuvant hormonotherapy was prescribed
in 65.1% (203/312); 1 case was missing and 5 not undergone
to surgery. The variation in the denominators is the result
of taking into account the missing values in the clinicalpathological parameters.

rabbit, anti-mouse and anti-goat immunoglobulins in PBS;
streptavidin conjugated to HRP in PBS; and liquid 3–3′
diaminobenzidine in chromogen solution. The polyclonal
antibody anti-ErbB2, A0485 (Dako) was used with the
Ultraview detection kit in an automatic staining system
(Benchmark XT, USA).
Staining optimization, evaluation parameters and
analyses were established by two pathologists who were
blinded to the clinical status. The overexpression of
GRP94, FN14 and TRAF2 was categorized as positive
when strong expression was detected and negative when
no or weak expression was detected, in order to avoid
false positives (Figure 1A), taking into account the known
expression in a control tissue, as previously reported [24].
Four tumor-metastasis pairs of kidney and lung
carcinoma from paraffin archives were used to explore the
expression of biomarkers in tumors different from breast.

Prioritization of brain metastasis candidates
using protein–protein interactions
First, a protein–protein interaction subnetwork
(PPIN) of the whole human interactome was built
around a set of proteins known to be crucial for
brain metastatic growth (i.e., root proteins). All the
interactions of root proteins were retrieved from
BIANA, provided that the interaction had been
identified using an experimental method other than a
pull-down method. Though suitable for defining protein
complexes, interactions from pull-down methods might
introduce spurious binary interactions between proteins.
Then, gene expression levels were mapped onto the
network. A protein was considered to be differentially
expressed if the gene encoding for it was differentially
expressed in the tissue microarray experiment. This
mapping allowed us to find the active subnetworks:
clusters of the network with a significant proportion of
proteins produced by up- and down-regulated genes.
Next, we calculated a brain metastasis likelihood score
for all the nodes in the human interactome using GUILD
[27], a network-based disease-gene prioritization
software. GUILD assigns a disease-implication score to
each node in the network by disseminating information
about roots (known metastatic growth proteins) to other
nodes through the links in the network. It can also be
used to prioritize drugs for their potential to intervene
in a given disease by considering the scores of the drug
targets [28]. We used 15 root proteins (selected from
those identified by proteomics analysis) for which
we found interactions in the human interactome (see
Supplementary Table S1). We applied the NetCombo
algorithm implemented in GUILD, which produces a
consensus score that considers the distance from the
nodes to the roots in the network.
Next, we used the GUILD scores assigned
to proteins to rank candidate drugs (listed in

Tissue microarrays (TMAs) and
immunohistochemistry (IHC)
TMAs were prepared from three representative
areas of the tumor that were carefully selected from
hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections of the donor blocks.
Core cylinders of 1 mm diameter were punched from
each tumor using a skin-biopsy punch and deposited into
recipient paraffin blocks using a specific arraying device
(Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI) as described
elsewhere [24]. Three-μm sections of the resulting tissue
microarray block were cut and used for IHC analysis after
being transferred to glass slides.
To optimize each immunohistochemical analysis,
the corresponding control tissues for the expression of
each protein were also used. Antigens were retrieved
by heating in a pressure cooker for 7 minutes in the
appropriate buffer. Primary antibodies anti-GRP94 at
1/2000 (sc-1794) and anti-FN14 at 1/3000 (sc-27143),
both Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and antiTRAF2 at 1/100 (SM7106P, Acris Antibodies, Herford,
Germany) were diluted in Dako Real™ Antibody Diluent
Buffer (Dakocytomation; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark):
Tris buffer, pH 7.2, 15 mM Na3N. LSAB+System-HRP
(Dakocytomation) was used, including biotinylated antiwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the average GUILD score of its known targets. Drugprotein information was retrieved from the DrugBank
database [29].

The controversial use of MDA-MB 435 cells has
been recently clarified, since it has been demonstrate that
MDA-MB 435 cells are an useful breast cancer model that
expresses both, epithelial and melanocytic markers [34].
Animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal
injection of ketamine/ medetomidine, with a previous
subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine, and placed
in a stereotactic apparatus. An incision was made over
the cranial midline with a scalpel, and a hole 1 mm
posterior to the bregma and 2 mm to the right of the
midline was made with a 25 gauge needle by hand.
Two microliters of the cell suspension at 107 cells/ml
in HBSS was infused with a Hamilton® 10 μl syringe
(Bonaduz, Switzerland) and a Hamilton® needle
(ga26s/51mm/pst2). Finally, the incision was sutured
and medetomidine was added as the antidote. Animals
were imaged and weighed three times within a week (on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday), and were euthanized
when they showed signs of declining health and visible
body weight loss.

Animal models
Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu female mice weighing
22–28 g were purchased from Harlan Laboratories S.A.
(Barcelona, Spain) and were housed in the IDIBELL
facility in SFP conditions, at 20–24°C, 60% relative
humidity, and 12–12-hour light-dark periods. Animals
were allowed free access to UV-irradiated water and an
adequate sterile diet. All animal-related procedures were
performed in accordance with the National Institute of
Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals, with the approval of the animal care committee.
Xenografts from primary tumors and brain metastasis
biopsies
Samples were collected at Hospital Universitari de
Bellvitge (L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain).
The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board. Written informed consent was collected from
patients. Non-necrotic tissue pieces (2–3 mm3) from
resected ductal breast carcinoma (TNBC-EG and TNBC1070) or brain metastasis biopsies (BrM1110) were
placed in DMEM (BioWhittaker) supplemented with
10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. The xenografts
were implanted in animals under isofluorane-induced
anesthesia, either in the intramammary fat path (i.m.f.p)
or subcutaneously when the biopsy belonged to primary
breast carcinoma or brain metastasis, respectively. When
the i.m.f.p. tumors reached ~1000 mm3, they were excised,
dissected into 2–3 mm3 cubes and transplanted into
additional mice using the same procedure.

In vivo bioluminescence imaging
Mice were injected subcutaneously with 10 μl/g
body weight of D-Luciferin (Biosynth AG) 15 minutes
before imaging. We anesthetized the animals with 4%
Isofluorane gas in 2 l/min O2 and maintained anesthesia
inside the chamber with 2% Isofluorane at 2 l/min O2 during
acquisition. The animals were placed in the prone position.
Cells showing bioluminescence were detected and quantified
using the Living Image 4.1 image analysis software (Caliper,
LifeSciences Hopkinton, MA). The parameter chosen for
treatment evaluation was the total flux (p/s).
The background signal of each mouse (photons
emitted by the mouse before the injection of luciferin) was
subtracted in every bioluminescence cranial measurement.
The bioluminescence analysis was conducted once
a week during the early stages of the disease and twice
a week when brain masses began to grow exponentially.

Brain metastasis in vivo experiments
To induce brain metastases the highly brain
metastatic cell line BR-eGFP-CMV/Luc-V5CA (BRV5)
[30] was intracranially implanted [31]. In brief, 435-Br1
cells originally established from a brain metastasis in a
nude mouse orthotopically inoculated with the triple
negative MDA-MB 435 parental cell line [32], contain the
retroviral vector preGFP-CMV-PLuc with the enhanced
green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene, under the control
of the 5′ LTR, and the photinus luciferase (PLuc) gene,
under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter
[33]. Vector preparation and packaging of viral particles
was performed as described previously. A cell population
that uniformly expressed the highest levels of eGFP
(BR-eGFP-CMV/Luc) was selected by FACS (MoFlo,
Cytomation, Dako, Denmark). Left ventricle (LV)
injection of cells and their further isolation from mouse
brain was repeated five times, obtaining BR-eGFP-CMV/
Luc-V1 to V5 cells through these cycles.

characterization in mice

tumor

The morphology of the engrafted tumors and brain
metastases was analyzed by H&E staining in paraffinembedded sections. Determination of GRP94, FN14 and
TRAF2 was performed as described previously. IHC
analysis with anti-CD31 (Dako) at (1/100), anti-TWEAK
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at (1/300) and anti-GFAP
(Dako) at (1/16000) were performed.
Therapeutic protocols
For brain metastasis treatment, we started therapy on
day 14 once the mice had recovered from surgery and after
checking the success of cell inoculation.
Lenalidomide (LND), a thalidomide derivative, was
obtained from the Celgene Corporation (Summit, NJ) and
from Sellek Chemicals LLC (Houston, TX). LND was

Statistical analysis

Angels Sierra has received research funding from
Celgene Research, S. L.

To evaluate the correlation between protein expres­
sion and brain metastasis in patients, immunostained
samples were graded on a three-category scale (negative,
weak positive, and strong positive). The marker was
classed as being overexpressed in strong positive samples.
The association with brain metastasis for each marker was
tested using a two-sided Fisher exact test and summarized
by calculating the sensitivity among tumors that developed
metastasis, and specificity among tumors without metastasis,
for strong positive values. Positive and negative likelihood
ratios were also calculated as integrated predictive indexes,
as was the area under the ROC curve. Markers were
assessed using a multivariate logistic regression model in a
forward stepwise procedure to identify the best combination
for predicting brain metastasis. Since ErbB2 was already a
known metastasis risk factor, an analysis including ErbB2
as the baseline was also performed, as well as a stratified
analysis of each candidate marker within ErbB2-positive
and -negative tumors. In all analyses, associations were
considered significant when p was less than 0.05.
To compare survival times for the control and
LND in mice groups, we used the non-parametric MannWhitney test and the log-rank test.
The bioluminescence data were transformed
using the log(1 + x) function (where x = AvR), in order
to obtain a more regular and positive distribution.
Subsequently, these data were normalized by subtracting
the first observation (day 14) from each of the following
observations. The Student’s t test was used to compare the
treatment groups. Survival curves for each treatment were
estimated via the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank
test was used to assess the significance of differences in
both, patients and mice follow-up.
P-values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.
