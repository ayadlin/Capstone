ABSTRACT
Therapies targeting the tyrosine kinase activity of Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor (EGFR) have been proven to be effective in treating a subset of non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring activating EGFR mutations. Inevitably these
patients develop resistance to the EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
Here, we performed integrated genomic analyses using an in vitro system to uncover
alternative genomic mechanisms responsible for acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.
Specifically, we identified 80 genes whose expression is significantly increased in the
erlotinib-resistant clones. RNAi-based systematic synthetic lethal screening of these
candidate genes revealed that suppression of one upregulated transcript, SCRN1, a
secernin family member, restores sensitivity to erlotinib by enhancing inhibition of
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis revealed
increased levels of SCRN1 in 5 of 11 lung tumor specimens from EGFR-TKIs resistant
patients. Taken together, we propose that upregulation of SCRN1 is an additional
mechanism associated with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs and that its suppression
serves as a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance in these patients.

INTRODUCTION

[1, 2]. In particular, epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy with tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib, gefitinib
and afatinib have been effective in a subset of
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
harboring EGFR activating mutations [3–6].

The success of genome-directed small molecule
inhibitors targeted against aberrantly activated tyrosine
kinases have changed the clinical paradigm of cancer
treatments and ushered in the age of precision medicine

Two common EGFR somatic alterations, the L858R
mutation in exon 21 and exon 19 in-frame deletions
encompassing amino acids 747 to 749, represent about
90% of EGFR mutations in lung adenocarcinoma, and
predict clinical responses to EGFR- TKIs [7–12]. Dramatic
radiologic responses are observed with the EGFR-TKIs,
however, almost all patients become resistant less than
1 year after initial treatment [13]. The most prevalent
mechanism of acquired resistance, accounting for ~50%
of resistant cases, is the acquisition of a secondary EGFR
mutation, a substitution of threonine at the “gatekeeper”
amino acid 790 to methionine (T790M) in exon 20,
resulting in increased binding affinity of EGFR to ATP
over inhibitors [14–16].
In addition to the EGFR gatekeeper mutation, altered
expression profiles, somatic single nucleotide variants and
copy number alterations have also been found as mechanisms
driving acquired resistance [17, 18]. These include gene
amplification of MET, ERBB2 or CRKL [19–21], somatic
mutations in PI3KCA or BRAF [22, 23], NF1 loss [24], and
increased levels of IGF1R or AXL [25, 26]. Furthermore,
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) or histological
transformation to small-cell lung cancer has been reported to
be responsible for EGFR-TKIs resistance [27]. Nevertheless,
the mechanism of acquired resistance is still unknown for
about 30% of remaining cases [28, 29].
In the present study, we carried out integrated
genomic analyses to identify additional genomic alterations
associated with acquired EGFR-TKIs resistance, and in
particular, to discover resistance mechanisms that occur
in the context of enhanced enzymatic activity associated
with mutant EGFR. Therefore we established an erlotinibresistant in vitro model system using PC9 NSCLC
cells ectopically overexpressing the exon 19 deletion
EGFR mutant and identified genes whose expression is
significantly increased or decreased in erlotinib-resistant
clones compared to parental cell lines by expression
profiling. Utilizing further RNAi-based synthetic
lethal screening, we found that suppression of SCRN1
in erlotinib-resistant clones restores drug sensitivity,
suggesting that upregulation of SCRN1 may be a new
mechanism for rendering the EGFR mutant-lung cancer
cell lines to erlotinib resistance.

that the elevated kinase activity associated with mutant
EGFR is largely unexplored. To address this uncertainty,
we sought to examine: 1) if increased kinase acitivity
promotes the onset of acquired resistance to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib and 2) how it contributes
to resistance mechanisms. We first generated a stable
EGFR mutant overexpression cell model system using PC9
lung adenocarcinoma cells which harbor an endogenous
EGFR exon 19 deletion (Ex19Del) mutation and are
sensitive to either erlotinib or gefitinib [30]. To specifically
investigate the role of elevated enzymatic activity of
Ex19Del mutant in EGFR-TKI resistance, and not be
confounded by constitutive phosphorylation-mediated
downstream signaling, we utilized a phosphorylationimpaired EGFR mutant. In this particular experimental
setup, all 10 C-terminal tyrosine residues were substituted
to phenylalanine in the background of exon 19 deletion
mutant (Ex19Del/CYF10) in generating the cell model.
We then established erlotinib-resistance in the PC9
cell model by culturing in the presence of escalating
doses of erlotinib from 0.05 μM to 10 μM, and then
isolating individual single-cell clones, as previously
described [19]. Notably, Ex19Del/CYF10 expressing PC9
(PC9/CYF10) cells acquired the resistance to erlotinib
much faster than PC9 parental (51 days vs. 151 days),
demonstrating that increased enzymatic activity of mutant
EGFR by overexpression of mutant EGFR lacking
autophosphorylation promotes the acquisition of erlotinib
resistance in PC9 cells. The resistance of single-cell derived
PC9/CYF10 clones (C1–C5) to erlotinib was further
confirmed by cell viability (Figure 1A), colony formation
assays in soft agar (Supplementary Figure S1A) as well
as in vivo subcutaneous mouse xenografts (Figure 1B).
Immunoblotting analysis revealed that when compared
to the PC9/CYF10 parental cell line, the phosphorylation
of endogenous EGFR as well as its downstream
signaling molecules, AKT and ERK1/2 in clone 1 (C1)
and clone 2 (C2) cells, were not completely inhibited
by erlotinib treatment (Supplementary Figure S1B).
In contrast to previous studies that reported the emergence
of EGFR T790M gatekeeper secondary mutation in PC9
cells [31, 32], we detected no additional mutation on EGFR
in this context (Supplementary Figure S1C) [25, 33–35].
In addition, genomic alterations previously identified to be
associated with drug resistance including increased levels
of ErbB2, AXL, MET, NF-κB, Vimentin or decreased
E-cadherin or PTEN loss [13] were not detected by
immunoblotting analysis in the erlotinib-resistant cell
clones (Supplementary Figure S1D). Therefore, in this
model, the incomplete inhibition of EGFR signaling by
erlotinib and acquired erlotinib resistance is likely induced
through a previously uncharacterized mechanism(s)
[21, 36] and thus ideally suited to explore novel genomic
alterations mediating resistance to erlotinib in the context

untreated resistant cells vs. untreated parental cells, and
erlotinib-treated resistant cells vs. untreated resistant
cells (Supplementary Table S3). Of the 48 statistically
significant genes selected, 10 were commonly identified
as potential modulators of survival of C1 and C2
cells in the three different comparisons (Figure 1E).
Among those 10 genes, we found SCRN1 to be of great
interest because its upregulation was strongly associated
with genomic alterations of EGFR across all three
available lung adenocarcinoma data sets in cBioPortal
(www.cbioportal.org) (Supplementary Table S4)
[39, 40]. We confirmed that both SCRN1 protein and
mRNA levels were significantly higher in resistant clones
than in parental PC9/CYF10 cells (Figure 1F and 1G).
Furthermore, SCRN1, a 50kDa cytosolic protein involved
in the regulation of exocytosis from mast cells [41], is
known to be upregulated in various cancers including
gastric, prostate and colorectal cancers and its expression
is correlated with poor prognosis of synovial sarcoma
[42–45]. Thus, we decided to explore whether upregulation
of SCRN1 serve as a potential mechanism for EGFR-TKIs
resistance by further functional characterization.

RNAseq analyses identified gene signature of
erlotinib-resistance in lung adenocarcinoma cell
line
RNAseq-based expression profiles of two resistant
clones (C1 and C2) and two parental cell lines with or
without erlotinib treatment were generated to identify
differentially expressed genes that may be associated
with erlotinib resistance (Figure 1C and Supplementary
Table S1 and Supplementary Figure S2A). To nominate
candidate genes whose increased expression levels may
be responsible for acquired resistance to erlotinib for
further functional screening, we filtered out the genes with
low expression as well as whose effect size of difference
was minimal (see Materials and Methods for detail). In
addition, we excluded the genes whose expression simply
increased in response to erlotinib treatment, by comparing
expression of parental PC9 cells after treatment with
erlotinib. Upon these analyses, 80 genes were selected
whose expression is significantly upregulated in erlotinibresistant PC9/CYF10 cells (C1 and C2) and 47 genes
that were downregulated (Figure 1C and Supplementary
Table S2 and Supplementary Figure S2A). Notably, gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that the downregulated genes are significantly correlated with the downregulated expression signature found in erlotinib-resistant
NCI-H1975 cells upon treatment with an irreversible
EGFR-TKI, which have both L858R and T790M
mutations in EGFR [37]. These results are consistent with
our hypothesis that these cell lines may have expression
changes reversible by reactivation of certain transcriptional
programs (Supplementary Figure S2B).

SCRN1 overexpression is associated with EGFRTKIs resistance and attenuates the effect of
erlotinib on the downstream AKT pathway
We next investigated whether the increased SCRN1
expression found in resistant clones plays a role in
rendering erlotinib resistance. Specifically, we examined
whether suppression of SCRN1 via shRNAs (shSCRN1)
in the resistant clones leads to restoration of erlotinib
sensitivity. All five erlotinib resistant clones (C1 to C5)
transfected with four individual shSCRN1, showed a
reduction of cell viability upon erlotinib treatment at
a comparable level to parental PC9 cells (Figure 2A),
confirming downregulation of SCRN1 resensitizes these
clones to treatment. The same clones transduced with
control shRNA (shGFP) remained refractory to erlotinib
(Figure 2A). In contrast, the growth of another lung
adenocarcinoma cell line, A549 which harbors wildtype EGFR, was unaffected, suggesting that increased
sensitization to erlotinib by shRNA-mediated suppression
of SCRN1 is specific to EGFR Ex19Del resistant cells
(Figure 2A). In addition, growth inhibition of C1 and C2
cells in the cells with shSCRN1, but not in the cells with
shGFP was dose-dependent (Figure 2B). Furthermore, we
found that shSCRN1 expressing resistant clones exhibited
decreased colony formation even in the absence erlotinib
treatment when compared to cells stably expressing
control shGFP (Figure 2C), suggesting that SCRN1
may play a crucial role in oncogenic growth of these
cells. This result is consistent with recent findings that
suppression of SCRN1 in colon cancer cells inhibited
cell proliferation and colony formation [44, 46]. Caspase
3/7 activity was markedly increased in resistant clones

siRNA synthetic lethality screening identified
genes associated with resistance to EGFR-TKIs
Next, to investigate whether any of the 80
upregulated candidate genes may function as novel
genomic determinants of acquired erlotinib resistance,
we performed synthetic lethality screening with siRNAs
targeting these genes in the C1 and C2 cells (Figure 1D).
All expected performance parameters passed the
screen quality control (QC) evaluation, revealing a
low Coefficient of variation (CV) < 10%, siRNA high
transfection efficiency of > 98% and high Z-factor
of > 0.77. In addition, we observed high coefficient
of determination of R2 values between the replicates
within each run as well as the two biological runs for
each cell lines (Supplementary Figure S2C and S2D).
GFP was chosen as the siRNA control. We used the
RIGER method [38] to determine the differential
lethality in three different comparisons; erlotinibtreated resistant cells vs. erlotinib-treated parental cells,

stably expressing shSCRN1, indicating that this impaired
transforming ability through down-regulation of SCRN1
may be mediated via apoptosis (Figure 2D) [47]. Taken
together, these data demonstrate that upregulation of
SCRN1 not only confers resistance but also is important
for oncogenic activity in our erlotinib resistant clones,
suggesting that suppression of SCRN1 may serve as an
additional therapeutic strategy to overcome acquired
erlotinib resistance.
While suppression of SCRN1 expression alone
increased apoptosis, we observed that suppression of
SCRN1 in combination with erlotinib treatment enhanced
apoptotic activity (Figure 3A). In addition, this effect is
larger following the treatment by the second generation

irreversible EGFR-TKIs, afatinib or dacomitinib [6, 48],
suggesting that downregulation of SCRN1 increases
the drug efficacy of not only erlotinib but also the other
EGFR-TKIs (Figure 3A).
Biochemical analyses show that levels of
constitutively phosphorylated AKT and ERK1/2
were reduced by either erlotinib or dacomitinib in C1
cells transduced with shSCRN1 as compared to those
with shGFP (Figure 3B lanes 10, 12, 14 and 16, and
Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B). In contrast, parental
cells or resistant clones with shSCRN1 alone had little or
no effect in attenuating AKT or ERK1/2 activation under
normal cell culture conditions (Figure 3B; lanes 1 and 9).

pathways are crucial for cell growth and transforming
ability of NSCLC cell lines harboring mutant EGFR
[49, 50]. Consistent with previous reports [51], we found
that PI3K/AKT inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 effectively
suppressed the growth of both parental PC9 and resistant
cell lines in a dose dependent manner, while MEK inhibitor
AZD6244 displayed no effect on cell viability (Figure 3C
and Supplementary Figure S3C). These results indicate
that inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathways resulting
from SCRN1 suppression may be directly responsible for
increased induction of apoptosis by EGFR-TKIs, resulting
in consequent restoration of erlotinib sensitivity in C1 and
C2 cells [52, 53]. The growth inhibitory effect of NVPBEZ235 was increased by combinatorial treatment with
erlotinib in parental cells (Figure 3D and Supplementary
Figure S4A), but was not observed in C1 and C2 cells
(Figure 3E and Supplementary Figure S4B, S4C and S4D)
[51, 54]. Given that the levels of SCRN1 are unaffected by
erlotinib treatment in these cells, these data provide further
evidence that SCRN1 overexpression attenuates the effect
of erlotinib on the downstream PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway, thereby decreasing the sensitivity to EGFR
inhibitory drugs. We found a synergistic growth inhibition
effect by coupling NVP-BEZ235 treatment with silencing
of SCRN1 by shRNA in C1 and C2 cells (Figure 3F and
Supplementary Figure S4E and S4F), as well as more
effective inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathways

by NVP-BEZ235 when SCRN1 is downregulated
(Supplementary Figure S4G). Clinical significance of
these combinatorial response needs further investigated
using in vivo mouse model in future studies.
While our data from the loss-of-function based
approaches provide compelling evidence that show a
relationship between the downregulation of SCRN1
and the restoration of sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs in the
resistant clones, we were unable to establish resistance
to EGFR-TKIs in any additional EGFR mutation-bearing
lung cancer cell lines through ectopic overexpression of
SCRN1 (Supplementary Figure S5A, S5B and data not
shown). The functional uncertainty of SCRN1 mediated
resistance in other EGFR mutant backgrounds may reflect
differences in genomic alterations, expression profiles and
signaling networks that remains unclear at this time.

Suppression of SCRN1 increases EGFR-TKIs
sensitivity for T790M-bearing NCI-H1975 cells
by enhancing apoptosis via PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway
We next examined expression of SCRN1
in additional lung adenocarcinoma cell lines by
immunoblotting analysis and found that protein levels
of SCRN1 were the most elevated in NCI-H1975 and

NCI-H1650 cell lines (Figure 4A). NCI-1975 cells are
known to be resistant to erlotinib as a consequence of
secondary EGFR T790M mutation [15, 55], we therefore
sought to explore the functional significance of SCRN1
in these cells. Similar to PC9/CYF10 derived C1 and C2
clones, suppression of SCRN1 via shRNA significantly
increased caspase 3/7 activity in NCI-H1975 cells, and
treatment with EGFR-TKIs including erlotinib, afatinib
or dacomitinib further enhanced apoptosis (Figure 4B).
In contrast, A549 cells remained unaffected under the same
condition. Consistent with these results, immunoblotting
analysis showed that AKT phosphorylation in response
treatment with afatinib or dacomitinib was significantly
reduced following SCRN1 suppression by shRNA
in NCI-H1975 cells (Figure 4C), demonstrating that
suppression of SCRN1 expression enhanced the drug
sensitivity of NCI-H1975 cells by modulating PI3K/
AKT signaling pathways. The growth of these cells are
also significantly abrogated by PI3K/AKT inhibitor
NVP-BEZ235, but not by MEK inhibitor AZD6244
(Supplementary Figure S6A) [53]. In addition, similar
to PC9/CYF10 erlotinib resistant cells, this growth

inhibition by NVP-BEZ235 were significantly increased
with suppression of SCRN1 expression, but not by
combinatorial treatment with erlotinib (Figure 4D and
Supplementary Figure S6B) [56]. In contrast, we did not
observe any differences in A549 cells under the same
experimental condition (Supplementary Figure S6C).
Taken together, these results suggest that upregulation of
SCRN1 contributes to cell survival of T790M-mediated
erlotinib resistant cells by modulating PI3K/AKT
signaling pathways as well.
Furthermore, we analyzed publicly available Cancer
Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) data [57] and found that
IC50 of erlotinib is significantly lower in cell lines with
low SCRN1 expression than in cell lines with higher
SCRN1 expression (Supplementary Figure S7), supporting
the notion that level of SCRN1 expression is correlated
with erlotinib sensitivity. However, it needs to be further
investigated whether suppression of SCRN1 is directly
associated with the growth inhibition of lung cancer cell
lines with elevated SCRN1 expression and whether it
modulates the sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs in these cell lines.

SCRN1 overexpression was detected in a subset
of EGFR TKIs-resistant NSCLC patients

Medical School). Transient transfection experiments
were performed using XtremeGene 9 (Roche) according
to manufacturer’s instruction. Cells were serum-starved
for 16 hours before drug treatment and harvested for
making lysates. Erlotinib (LC laboratories), afatinib
(LC laboratories), dacomitinib (Selleckchem), NVPBEZ235 (Selleckchem, PI3K/AKT inhibitor) and AZD
6244 (Selleckchem, MEK inhibitor) were dissolved in
DMSO at 10 mM.

To further investigate the clinical significance
of our findings, we measured the levels of SCRN1 by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 11 tumor specimens
from lung adenocarcinoma patients who developed
resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib. All analyzed tumor
specimens harbored an EGFR mutation encoding L858R
or the Ex19Del (Supplementary Table S5). Consistent with
previous reports [21, 24, 25], we detected EGFR T790M
gatekeeper mutation in 5 of 11 (45.5%) (Figure 5A),
while MET amplification measured by fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was not detected in any
of the specimens tested (Supplementary Table S5). We
observed high levels of SCRN1 in 5 out of 11 (45.5%) of
the EGFR TKIs- resistant specimens (Figure 5A and 5B).
Because we were unable to evaluate the matched
pretreatment samples, we cannot exclude the possibility
that high SCRN1 expression preexisted in these tumors
before EGFR-TKIs treatment. Nevertheless, four of the
EGFR-TKIs resistant tumors with detected SCRN1 levels
harbored neither an EGFR T790M nor amplified MET,
showing a trend toward mutual exclusivity of SCRN1
expression with EGFR T790M or MET amplification,
however, a larger cohort would be necessary to make a
strong statistical conclusion. These results demonstrate that
SCRN1 is overexpressed in a subset of activating EGFR
mutation-bearing lung adenocarcinomas with acquired
resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Taken together, we propose that
the inhibition of upregulated SCRN1 in combination with
EGFR-TKIs can be used as a novel therapeutic strategy in
the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma patients refractory
to TKIs.

Anchorage-independent growth assay
Soft agar assays were conducted in triplicated as
previously described (Cho et al., 2013) with minor changes
(2 × 104 cells were used per well). After 2–3 weeks,
digital images were taken and the number of colonies was
quantified using GelCount software (Oxford) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. The data were presented
as a relative ratio in a graph following normalization to
number of colonies formed by control cells. Each assay was
repeated a minimum of two times with comparable results.

Cell growth inhibition assay
PC9 (8 × 103 cells), NCI-H1975 (8 × 103 cells)
or A549 (6 × 103 cells) were plated in 180 µl media in
96-well flat-bottom plates (Corning). After 24 hours, cells
were treated with drugs at the indicated concentrations
and incubated as previously described [58]. For the RNAi
study, cells were seeded into 96 well plates for overnight
and then transfected with shRNA expressing lentiviruses
with polybrene for 72 hours. Transfected cells were treated
with indicated drugs for additional 72 hours. Viable
cell numbers were measured using Cell Counting Kit-8
solution (Dojindo). Absorbance was measured at 450 nm
after 3 hours. Data are expressed as percentage of growth
relative to that of untreated control cells.

prior to infection and subsequently incubated with diluted
virus containing media with 8 µg/mL polybrene for 4
hours. Transfected cells were pooled and treated with
puromycin for 1 week. For siRNA studies, cells plated in
10cm plate or 6-well plates were transfected with either
SCRN1 targeting siRNA (Bioneer) using Lipofectamine
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Scrambled siRNA (Dharmacon) used as negative control.
After 48 hours, transfected cells were treated with drugs
as indicated followed by immunoblotting.

than 10% of positive staining cancer cells was counted as
positive.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
analysis
Deparaffinized 4 μm sections were submitted to
dual-color FISH analysis according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using a Histology FISH Accessory Kit (Vysis,
Illinois, USA) with a MET/CEN7q Dual Color FISH
Probe purchased from Abbot laboratory (Vysis, Illinois,
USA). Results are interpreted as the average ratio of MET/
chromosome 7 signals in 50 non-overlapping nuclei.

Caspase 3/7 activity assay
Caspase 3/7 activity in cell extracts and culture
supernatant was measured using the Caspase-Glo 3/7
Assay Kit (Promega) according to manufacturer’s
instruction. Briefly, parental or transfected cells were
plated in 96-well plate and treated with either vehicle,
erlotinib, afatinib or dacomitinib for 24 hours. After
addition of 100 µl Caspase 3/7 reagent and a gentle
mixing, the cells were incubated for 1 hour at room
temperature, and the luminescence of each sample was
measured by luminometer.

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Total cellular RNA was prepared from the cells by
using and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). And total RNA was
used to synthesize the first strand cDNA using RNA to
cDNA EcoDry premix Oligo-dT (Clontech). Quantitative
PCRs were performed with the use of SYBR green PCR
Master Mix (Toyobo) [59] and we used an ABI 7300
real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). GAPDH
was used as the internal standard for normalization. The
primer sequences used are as follows; SCRN1 primer set
(forward: 5′-GGAGAGGGCGAGTTCAATTT-3′; reverse:
5′-GCACTGTGATGCTTTCTTCTTG-3′), GAPDH primer
set (forward: 5′-GGTGTGAACCATGAGAAGTATGA-3′;
reverse: 5′-GAGTCCTTCCACGATACCAAAG-3′).

Xenografted mouse study
All animal experiments were carried out in
accordance with IACUC of Laboratory Animal Research
Center (LARC; AAALAC International-approved facility)
in Samsung Medical Center. PC9 and resistant cell lines
(107/50 μl) were injected into 4 week-old male BALB/
c-nude mice (n = 4 or 5 mice per group). Mice were
purchased from Charles River Japan. Mice were randomly
assigned to erlotinib treatment or no treatment groups for
each cell line. After the tumor size reached approximately
150–300 mm3, mice were treated with erlotinib
(25 mg/kg/day) or control three times per week by oral
gavage. Tumor volume was measured using caliper three
times per week and calculated using the formula Volume
= Length × Width2/2. Mice were sacrificed when morbid.

RNAseq-based gene expression profiling
Total RNA purified from two independent cultures
of DMSO passaged control and erlotinib resistant
cultures of PC9 cells was used to prepare cDNA for
sequencing with the Illumina HiSeq2500 using the
TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, USA).
Paired-end 50 base pair RNA-sequencing reads
were mapped to the human RefSeq transcripts using
DNAnexus (http://dnanexus.com) analysis module and
gene expression values were obtained by the RPKM
normalization method. We analyzed the data with use
of the samr (Significance Analysis of Microarray in R)
package in Bioconductor. After the genes whose RPKM
is < 10 in all samples were filtered out, genes with fold
change > 50% with absolute RPKM change > 10 with
a statistical SAM score exceeding expected value at a
delta slope of 2.5 were considered statistically significant
as differentially expressed. We excluded genes whose
expression in RPKM increased by > 2-fold upon treatment
with erlotinib from the above identified upregulated genes.
Those genes whose expression is significantly upregulated
or downregulated in resistant PC9 cells were also used for
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) against Molecular
Signature Database (MSigDB) v3.0.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry for SCRN1 was performed
on unstained slides using antibody to SCRN1 (rabbit
polyclonal, dilution 1:50, Abcam). Slides were cut to a
thickness of 4 μm, deparaffinized in xylene and hydrated in
a graded series of alcohols. Heat-induced antigen retrieval
was performed by using a microwave oven and ER
1 buffer (pH 6.0). Sections were incubated in Bond-max
autoimmunostainer (Leica Biosystem) for 20 minutes
at 97°C. The IHC reactions were visualized using
Bond-max autoimmunostainer (Leica Biosystem) using
Bond™ Polymer refine detection, DS9800 (Vision
Biosystems). For SCRN1 immunohistochemistry, only
cytoplasmic staining was evaluated and the case with more

transformation across samples. To measure the association
between the gene expression level of SCRN1 and response
to erlotinib, IC50 values for erlotinib in cell lines were
compared between two groups, high SCRN1-expressing
and low expressing cell lines (using a cutoff value = 0.5).
The significance of difference between IC50 values were
compared using the Student’s two sample t-test.

Four siRNA sequences for each targeted gene were
picked from the Whole Human Genome siRNA Library
(Qiagen) to create custom 384-well assay plates. Total of
320 siRNAs against 80 up-regulated genes were picked.
In all assay plates, we included negative control siRNAs
(Non-Silencing, All-Star Non-Silencing, and GFP,
Qiagen), and two positive control siRNAs for transfection
(UBBs1 and All-Star Cell Death Control, Qiagen).
The siRNAs were printed individually into white solid
384-well plates (1l of 0.667 µM siRNA per well for a total
of 9 ng siRNA) using a Biomek FX (Beckman Coulter).
Lipofectamine was transferred into each well. Cells were
added into each well using a BIO-TEK mFill Microplate
Dispenser. Transfected cells were incubated for 24 hours
prior to the addition of 7.5 nM Erlotnib for sensitive
parental cells and 2 mM erlotinib for resistant cells as
well as vehicle control (DMSO). After further incubation
for additional 72 hours, cell viability was measured using
an Analyst GT Multimode reader (Molecular Devices).
Each condition was run in duplicate for all cell lines. A
biological replicate of the screen was also performed for all
cell lines, thus 4 replicates per condition for each cell line.

RNAi screening data analysis

Authors’ contributions

The siRNA screen included parental and resistant
cell lines, which were either untreated and treated
with Erlotinib and each cell line had 2 technical and 2
biological runs. The output of the raw luminescence data
from the plate readers were aligned and annotated with
their respective gene names and control types. The output
from ratio normalization was then used as an input to
RNAi gene enrichment ranking algorithm (RIGER) [38].
RIGER, a java extension of GENE-E software package
(http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E)
was used to calculate for enrichment of multiple siRNAs
targeting the same gene. Signal to noise metric for ranking
siRNAs and Kolmogorov-Smirnov method was used to
convert individual siRNA to genes. RIGER methodology
is nonparametric in its approach and uses Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Kolmogorov–Smirnov
(KS) to calculate gene scores from multiple siRNAs
targeting a gene. A list of ranked genes with Normalized
Enrichment Scores (NES) [60] is generated by RIGER.

JC conceptualized and supervised the entire project;
analyzed and interpreted data; wrote the manuscript. NK
