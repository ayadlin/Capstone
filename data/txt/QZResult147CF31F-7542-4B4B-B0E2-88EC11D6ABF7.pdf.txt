Abstract
Ileal bile acid binding protein (IBABP) is the only cytosolic
protein known to bind and transport bile acids. Because
IBABP is reportedly up-regulated in colorectal cancer, it has
been suggested as a link between bile acids and the risk of
colorectal cancer. However, in this study, we show that IBABP
is not up-regulated. Rather, a novel transcript of the IBABP
gene, which encodes an additional 49 NH2-terminal amino
acid residues, is up-regulated in colorectal cancer (P < 0.001).
The novel transcript, called IBABP-L, is also distinct from
IBABP because its transcription is controlled by nuclear
factor-KB (NF-KB) rather than by the farnesoid X receptor.
Most significantly, IBABP-L is necessary for the survival of
HCT116 colon cancer cells in the presence of physiologic
levels of the secondary bile acid deoxycholate. Collectively,
the studies point toward a unique bile acid response pathway
involving NF-KB and IBABP-L that could be useful for
diagnosis and could potentially be targeted for therapeutic
benefit. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9039–46]

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer
and the second leading cause of cancer mortality. It is estimated
that f150,000 cases of colorectal cancer will be diagnosed, and
55,000 people will die of colorectal cancer in the United States in
2006 (1). There are two well-described colorectal cancer syndromes
that are inherited: familial adenomatous polyposis, which arises
because of germ-line mutations in the APC gene, and hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, which is caused by germ-line
mutations in mismatch repair genes (2). These conditions account
for V5% of all cases of colorectal cancer; importantly though, the
majority of colorectal cancer is of sporadic nature with no unique
and clear genetic etiology. Consequently, there is a great need to
understand the mechanisms underlying the onset and progression
of sporadic colorectal cancer.
One factor that may be involved in sporadic colorectal cancer
is bile acid homeostasis. Epidemiologic studies indicate that
secondary bile acids, produced by colonic bacteria, are linked to
the incidence of colorectal cancer (see ref. 3 for reviews).
Experimental studies show that deoxycholic acid (DCA), a major
secondary bile acid, strongly enhances the protumorigenic effects

of chemical mutagens in animal models of colorectal cancer (4, 5).
DCA causes mitochondrial oxidative stress and DNA damage
and was proposed as a carcinogen (3). It is well known that
DCA can kill intestinal epithelial cells by apoptosis at a concentration usually seen in colon lumen of subjects with high fat diet;
however, it also has been suggested that DCA can either induce
cell death resistance or select death-resistant cells to promote
tumorigenesis (3).
Another pathway receiving increased attention in colorectal
cancer is that controlled by the nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)
transcription factor. In a resting state, the p50 and p65 subunits
of NF-nB form a heterotrimeric complex with InBa that sequesters
them in the cytoplasm. On various stimuli, InBa is degraded and
the p50-p65 heterodimer is translocated to the nucleus where it
binds specific regulatory elements and drives gene expression (6).
NF-nB is up-regulated in colorectal adenoma and adenocarcinoma
(7–10) and controls the expression of many colorectal cancer–
linked genes, including cyclooxygenase-2 and Bcl-2 (6). NF-nB is
also believed to be involved in the onset of colorectal cancer (6),
in the inflammatory process associated with colorectal cancer
(11), and in the development of resistance of colorectal cancer to
chemotherapy (12, 13).
In the present study, we uncover an unanticipated link between
NF-nB and bile acids. We have identified a variant of ileal bile acid
binding protein (IBABP) that arises from an alternative transcription start site (TSS). Unlike IBABP, which is transcribed by the
farnesoid X receptor/bile acid receptor (FXR), the new variant,
called IBABP-L, is regulated by a NF-nB binding site in a distal
promoter. IBABP-L contains 49 amino acids at its NH2 terminus
that are absent in IBABP. More significantly, the transcript for
IBABP-L is up-regulated in all stages of colorectal adenocarcinoma.
In fact, we show that the up-regulation of IBABP in colorectal
cancer reported in prior studies (14, 15) can be attributed to the
up-regulation of IBABP-L, whereas the expression of the previously
defined form of IBABP is unchanged in colorectal cancer. Most
significantly, IBABP-L is necessary for the survival of colon cancer
cells in the presence of secondary bile acids. These observations
provide an important mechanistic link between bile acids, NF-nB,
and colorectal cancer that can likely be exploited for therapeutic
benefit.

Cancer Research
Matched human colorectal adenoma, adenocarcinoma, and adjacent
normal mucosa were purchased from Asterand, Inc. or obtained from the
Cooperative Human Tissue Network (service of the National Cancer
Institute, Bethesda, MD). Patients have provided written consent for use
of tissues for scientific purpose. Tissue array slides containing human
colorectal cancer and matching normal tissues were ordered from Imgenex.
Assessing the expression of IBABP variants by PCR. Expression of
mRNA encoding IBABP-L (Genbank accession number DQ132786) and
IBABP (Genbank accession number NM_001445) along the digestive tract
was measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with
RNA from normal human intestine and liver purchased from Invitrogen
and from BioChain Institute, Inc. Expression of acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (ARPP0) was used as a control. The expression of IBABP-L,
IBABP, and total IBABP in human tumor and adjacent normal tissue was
measured with tissues purchased from Asterand, Inc. and from the
Cooperative Human Tissue Network as described above.
Total RNA was isolated from tissues using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) in a
protocol combined with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). For each sample,
frozen tissue (f0.1 g) was cut and soaked in prechilled RNAlater-ICE
stabilizing solution (1.0 mL; Ambion) for 24 h at 20jC. Tissue was minced
using a surgical scalpel, immersed in Trizol (1.0 mL), and homogenized
using a Tissue-Tearor (BioSpec Products). Chloroform (200 AL) was added
to homogenized tissue and sample was mixed by vortexing for 30 s. Samples
were centrifuged (12,000  g, 10 min at 4jC) to separate phases. The
aqueous phase was removed, added to an equal volume of 70% ethanol,
mixed by pipetting, and loaded into the RNeasy column. Following RNA
binding, an on-column DNase digestion protocol using RNase-Free DNase
Set (Qiagen) was done according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
To determine the relative expression levels of IBABP-L and IBABP, a twostep quantitative RT-PCR procedure was used. In the first step, cDNA was
synthesized from total RNA. For each sample, RNA (2.0 Ag) was reverse
transcribed using SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR
(Invitrogen) in a 20 AL final reaction volume containing 10 mmol/L
deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix (1.0 AL), 0.5 Ag/mL oligo(dT)12-18
(1.0 AL), 0.1 mol/L DTT (2.0 AL), 25 mmol/L MgCl2 (4.0 AL), 10 reverse
transcriptase buffer (2.0 AL), RNaseOUT Recombinant RNase Inhibitor
(1.0 AL), and SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (1.0 AL). Reverse
transcription was done at 42jC for 50 min and terminated by heating to
70jC for 15 min followed by chilling samples on ice. Template RNA was
cleaved by incubating with RNase H (1.0 AL) for 20 min at 37jC. In the
second step, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out on a Mx 3000P Realtime PCR System (Stratagene) using a solution containing diluted cDNA
(1:20; 2.0 AL), 1 SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and
primers for IBABP-L, IBABP, or ARPP0 (0.25 Amol/L). The primer sets are
as follows: IBABP, 5¶-CCACCCATTCTCCTCATCCCTCTGCTC-3¶ (in exon 4a)
and 5¶-ACCAAGTGAAGTCCTGCCCATCCTG-3¶ (in exon 5), and IBABP-L,
5¶-ACATGGGTGAGCCGGAAAGGAGAC-3¶ (in exon 3) and 5¶-CCGGAGTAGTGCTGGGACCAAGTGAAGT-3¶ (in exon 5). The primer set that cannot
distinguish IBABPL and IBABP is 5¶-AGGATGGGCAGGACTTCACTTG-3¶
(in exon 5) and 5¶-GCTCACGCGCTCATAGGTCAC-3¶ (in exon 7); the primer
set of ARPP0 is 5¶-CAAGACTGGAGACAAAGTGG-3¶ and 5¶-AATCTGCAGACAGACACTGG-3¶. All primers were designed using PrimerSelect (DNAStar)
and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. The following cycling
variables were used: denaturation at 95jC for 15 s, annealing at 56jC for
20 s, extension at 72jC for 30 s, and detection at 78jC for 5 s. After 40 cycles,
PCR products were subjected to dissociation curve analysis to check the PCR
specificity. Each sample was done in duplicate.
Values obtained from qPCR were normalized to expression of ARPP0.
The difference in RNA expression of IBABP-L and IBABP between colon
cancer tissue and matched adjacent normal mucosa was represented as fold
change (cancer versus normal). The correlation between IBABP-L
expression level and clinical variables (gender, age, race, tumor size, tumor
locale, differentiation level, and clinical stage) was analyzed by t test and
one-way ANOVA.
Regulation of expression of the IBABP variants in Caco-2 cells.
Caco-2 cells were seeded in six-well plates (BD Biosciences) at 2  105 per
well in phenol-free DMEM (Mediatech) supplemented with charcoal-

stripped FBS (Hyclone). Medium was replaced every 2 days until cells
reached 100% confluence and began spontaneous differentiation. Stock
solutions of CDCA (Sigma-Aldrich), as free acids, were prepared in absolute
ethanol (100 mmol/L) and stored at 20jC. Confluent Caco-2 cells were
incubated at 37jC for 24 h in medium containing 100 Amol/L CDCA or
solvent (0.1% ethanol). Cells were harvested, cellular RNA was isolated using
the RNeasy Mini kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction, and
expression of IBABP variants was determined by qPCR as described above.
Values obtained from qPCR were normalized to the expression of ARPP0.
The difference in RNA expression of IBABP-L and IBABP between CDCA
and control Caco-2 cells is represented as fold change.
Determine the TSS. Primer extension was conducted using Human
Small Intestine Marathon-Ready cDNA with Advantage 2 PCR kit (Clontech)
according to the manufacturer’s manual. Briefly, first PCR was done using
primers AP1 (included in the kit) and gene-specific primer 1 (GSP1)
5¶-ACATTATATTTTCTTGCCAAGTAGAGGA-3¶ (exon 2) followed by a nested
PCR with primer AP2 (included in the kit) and GSP2 5¶-ACTTGCCAGCTGCCTTCCT-3¶ (exon 3). The longest PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1
T/A cloning vector (Invitrogen) and 12 individual clones were sequenced.
The TSS was unanimously located 78 nucleotides away from GSP2. To
simplify the description, the position of the TSS ‘‘C’’ was set to as +1.
Construct the wild-type and modified IBABP-L promoter-luciferase
reporters. A 1.6-kb region ( from 1563 to +79) of IBABP-L promoter was
amplified from human bacterial artificial chromosome clone RP11-725E20
(Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA) by PCR
using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with primers 5¶-ACATTATATTTTCTTGCCAAGTAGAGGA-3¶ (1563/1534) and primer GSP2 described
above (+61/+79). The 1188/+79 and 1154/+79 fragments were amplified
using primer 5¶-GAAGTAGAGCTTCCTCTTC-3¶ (1188/1168) or primer
5¶-CCTGTCTAATTAGGAATAA-3¶ (1154/1137), respectively, together
with primer GSP2. PCR product was cloned into pCRII-Blunt-TOPO (Invitrogen)
for sequencing, and verified clone was digested by SpeI/XhoI (New England
Biolabs) restriction enzymes. The promoter fragment was retrieved and inserted
into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) between NheI and XhoI (New England
Biolabs). The single site–mutated pGL3_1165 G/C IBABP-L reporter was
generated from pGL3_1563/+79 IBABP-L using QuikChange MultisiteDirected Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primers 5¶-CTTCCTCTTCAAAGCGACTTTCCTTCCCG-3¶ and 5¶-CGGGAAGGAAAGTCGCTTTGAAGAGGAAG-3¶
(1179/1150, the 1165 G/C substitution is italicized).
Transient transfection and luciferase reporter assay. Individual
promoter construct (300 ng) and 100 ng of pRL-CMV vector (Promega) were
cotransfected into 2  105 HEK293 or HCT116 cells grown in 24-well plate
using 3 AL Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were then either
treated with 25 ng/mL of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) dissolved in PBS
(pH 7.4) for 5 h or left alone. For cotransfection with NF-nB complex in
HEK293 cells, 300 ng of individual promoter construct and 100 ng of
pRL-CMV were cotransfected with 300 ng each of plasmids encoding p65
and p50 (gift from Dr. Marty W. Mayo, University of Virginia, Charlottesville,
VA; ref. 16). For control cotransfection without p65/p50 constructs, pUC19
was used to make the DNA content equal. After 24 h of incubation, cells
were harvested in 1 Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and firefly and Renilla
luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Assay System
(Promega) with Veritas Microplate Luminometer. All activity data are the
mean F SD of three independent experiments done in triplicate.
Produce IBABP-L–specific antiserum and immunohistochemical
studies. A peptide unique to IBABP-L (CTWVSRKGDLQRMKQTHKGKPPSS)
was synthesized, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used to
immunize rabbits. Antisera were tested for reactivity against recombinant
IBABP-L and IBABP by Western blot. The antibody is highly specific for
IBABP-L, and its binding can be blocked by the synthetic peptide antigen.
The antisera (1:2,000) were used to stain paraffin-embedded array slides of
human colorectal carcinomas and normal adjacent tissues (Imgenex).
Binding of the antibody was detected with diaminobenzidine using a
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) system. The slides were counterstained with
hematoxylin. The microscopic photographs were taken at 100, 200, and
400 magnification with an Inverted TE300 Nikon wild field microscope
equipped with color CCD SPOT RT Camera (Diagnostic Instruments).

IBABP-L Up-regulation in Colorectal Cancer

Figure 1. Identification of IBABP-L, a new
transcript of IBABP. A, the gene encoding
both forms of IBABP was originally
annotated as fabp6 . The structure of this
gene is shown but is not drawn to scale.
Exons are labeled E1 to E7 and promoters
are labeled P1 and P2 . P1 drives the
expression of IBABP-L, whereas P2 controls
the transcription of IBABP. IBABP-L shares
exons 4b to 7 with IBABP and contains the
complete open reading frame for IBABP.
B, primers specific for each variant of IBABP
were used to assess their expression by
RT-PCR in mRNA extracted from intestine.
Reactions were done in duplicate.
A housekeeping gene, ARPP0 , was used
as a control to monitor the efficiency of
reverse transcription and PCR. The PCR
product was separated in 1.6% agarose gel.
The PCR product was also confirmed by
direct sequencing (data not shown).

IBABP short hairpin RNA transfection and cell death assays. Short
hairpin RNA (shRNA)-encoding constructs were purchased from Open
Biosystems. The sequence of the shRNA targeting IBABP is 5¶-CCCGCAACTTCAAGATCGTC-3¶. The sequence of the nonsilencing scrambled
shRNA is 5¶-ATCTCGCTTGGGCGAGAGTAAG-3¶. These constructs are in
the pSM2c vector and transcribed by type III RNA polymerase through the
U6 promoter. HCT116 cell suspension was mock transfected or transfected
with either pSM2c-IBABP, pSM2c-scrambled, or pSM2c at 200 ng DNA/1,000
cells and then seeded into 96-well plate at 1,000 cells per well. Following
transfection, cells were incubated at 37jC for 72 h and treated with DCA in
different concentration for 24 h. The cell apoptosis was measured using the
Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit (Roche Applied Science), which detects
the amount of cleaved DNA/histone complexes using a sandwich enzyme
immunoassay–based method. The value was determined using a colorimetric 96-well plate reader (Bio-Rad) and represented as mean F SD of
three independent experiments done in quadruplicate.

Results
Identification of a new variant of IBABP. While doing
preliminary PCR analysis to determine if IBABP was up-regulated
in human colorectal cancer tissue, we noticed significant upregulation of IBABP in tumor tissue compared with normal tissue
when using a primer set that hybridized in the coding sequence of
IBABP. Yet, when using a 5¶ primer hybridizing far upstream of
the start site of IBABP, up-regulation was not detected. This observation suggested that there could be an alternative form of IBABP.
To test this possibility, we searched the National Center for
Biotechnology Information human expression sequence tag (EST)
database1 using the IBABP sequence NM_001445. This search
revealed two ESTs (BM974219 and BU683560) that were identical to

www.aacrjournals.org

IBABP except that they encoded a protein with a predicted
49-amino acid extension on the NH2 terminus. To verify the
presence of this transcript, the two EST clones were obtained and
sequenced and compared with the sequence of human BAC clone
RP11-725E20 containing the IBABP gene [fatty acid binding protein
6 ( fabp6)]. These studies led to the finding that the mRNA
encoding IBABP-L contains seven exons, three of which are unique
and are present at the 5¶ end of the gene. The shorter transcript,
IBABP, contains only four exons and its transcription is initiated
within the third intron of the fabp6 gene (Fig. 1A). Thus, the two
variants of IBABP share exons 5 to 7 and part of exon 4. Both
variants could be detected in mRNA extracted from human
intestine by RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, searches of the
sequence databases indicate that IBABP-L is also present in
primates such as Rhesus monkeys and chimpanzees, but it is
absent in mouse, rat, and rabbit (data not shown). The complete
nucleotide sequence of IBABP-L transcript was deposited in
Genbank with accession number DQ132786.
IBABP and IBABP-L are differentially expressed in the
gastrointestinal tract. IBABP is primarily expressed in the
intestine (17). Therefore, we compared the expression of transcripts
encoding IBABP and IBABP-L in the gastrointestinal tract,
particularly in tissues associated with the enterohepatic bile acid
cycle (human liver, gallbladder, and intestinal sections). The studies
were conducted with tissue RNA extracted from donors who did
not have gastrointestinal diseases. Oligonucleotides capable of
selective amplification of each variant were used to initiate realtime qPCRs. The copy number of mRNA transcripts was
normalized to the expression of the housekeeping gene ARPP0,
also known as ribosomal protein large P0, which is often used as
an endogenous control in research on prostate and colon cancer
(18, 19). The transcript encoding IBABP-L was found at similar

Figure 2. Differential tissue expression
pattern and regulation of IBABP variants.
A, primers specific for each variant of
IBABP were used to quantify their
expression in mRNA extracted from human
liver, gallbladder, and sections of the
gastrointestinal tract (duodenum through
rectum) by quantitative RT-PCR. The
expression of each variant was normalized
using the housekeeping gene ARPP0.

by activation of FXR, were incubated with

weak levels in all tissues tested with the exception of the rectum
where it was expressed at lower levels (Fig. 2A). In contrast, IBABP
is highly expressed within a section of the intestine extending
from the jejunum through ascending colon with peak expression in
the ileum. In these sections, the expression of IBABP was 10- to
1,000-fold higher than the expression of IBABP-L.
IBABP and IBABP-L are differentially regulated by chenodeoxycholic acid. Like many other genes associated with bile acid
homeostasis, IBABP is regulated by the FXR. In fact, bile acids,
especially chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), bind directly to FXR
and activate its transcriptional function (20–22), which in turn
leads to up-regulation of IBABP (23, 24). Studies were conducted to
determine if IBABP-L is regulated in a similar manner. The effect
of CDCA on the expression of IBABP-L and IBABP was studied in
Caco-2 cells, which respond to CDCA by up-regulating IBABP (25).
Confluent Caco-2 cells were treated with 100 Amol/L of CDCA or
buffer, and the relative expression of transcripts encoding IBABP-L
and IBABP was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. As anticipated,
CDCA increased expression of IBABP by 14-fold. However, this bile
acid was without effect on expression of IBABP-L (Fig. 2B). These
results are consistent with the idea that the two variants of IBABP
arise from separate TSSs (Fig. 1A).
Transcription of IBABP-L is controlled by NF-KB. As a first
step toward understanding the transcriptional regulation of
IBABP-L, the TSS was successfully identified through 5¶-rapid
amplification of cDNA ends method. This information provided an
anchor point for mapping regions of the promoter of IBABP-L. The
genomic sequence of IBABP-L extending 1.6 kb upstream of TSS
was analyzed for putative transcription factor binding sites using
the P-Match program.2 A putative NF-nB binding motif was
identified 1.16 kb upstream of the TSS (Fig. 3A).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

To verify that NF-nB binds the response element and drives the
expression of IBABP-L, several studies were done with deletions
and mutations of the promoter linked to luciferase reporter in the
colon cancer cell line HCT116. Reporter vectors were constructed
to either delete the entire putative NF-nB binding motif or
mutate the most conserved ‘‘G’’ to ‘‘C’’ within this motif (Fig. 3A,
underlined). The wild-type promoter and modified reporters were
introduced into HCT116 cells, and luciferase activity was analyzed
at 24 h. The wild-type promoter for IBABP-L produced a 7.5-fold
increase in luciferase activity compared with the basic reporter
(Fig. 3B). Deletion of the sequences upstream of the putative NF-nB
binding motif had no effects on the luciferase activity. However,
when the whole binding motif was deleted, the reporter constructs
nullified its transcriptional activity. More importantly, a single
nucleotide substitution from G to C at the most conserved region
of the NF-nB binding motif also resulted in loss of promoter
activity (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, TNF-a, which is an activator of
NF-nB, dramatically increased the transcription activity of the wildtype promoter but not the mutated promoter (Fig. 3C).
The activity of the IBABP-L promoter was also tested in HEK293
cells, which have low endogenous levels of NF-nB. In these cells,
the IBABP-L promoter had low activity (Fig. 3D), but its activity
significantly increased when constructs encoding protein p65
and p50 of NF-nB were cotransfected into HEK293 cells (Fig. 3D).
This activation by p65/p50 was not observed when the IBABP-L
promoter lacked a functional NF-nB binding site (Fig. 3D).
Together, these findings provide strong support for the idea that
NF-nB regulates the transcription activity of the IBABP-L promoter.
IBABP-L is up-regulated in colorectal cancer. NF-nB is
implicated in multiple cancers, including colorectal cancer (6).
Because IBABP-L is regulated by NF-nB, we tested its expression
in colorectal tumors. The expression of IBABP and IBABP-L
was measured in 68 cases of colorectal cancer by quantitative
RT-PCR. The clinicopathologic data of all cases are shown in

IBABP-L Up-regulation in Colorectal Cancer

Supplementary Table S1. Experiments were done with primers that
selectively amplified each form of IBABP and also with a pair of
primers that amplified both forms together (total IBABP). The
gene expression level of the transcript in adenocarcinoma was
compared with its levels in adjacent normal tissue. The transcript
encoding IBABP-L was massively up-regulated in colorectal
adenocarcinoma; in some cases, it was expressed at levels
>100-fold higher than in normal tissue (Fig. 4A). IBABP-L was upregulated in 76% (52 of 68) of the colorectal cancers using a 2-fold
cutoff (P < 0.001). In contrast, there was no significant change
in the expression of IBABP in cancer tissue. Because of the upregulation of IBABP-L, total IBABP is also up-regulated.
Further statistical analysis was conducted to determine if the
up-regulation of IBABP-L is associated with any clinical variables
such as gender, age, race, tumor size, tumor locale, differentiation
level, and clinical stage. The expression of IBABP-L was not associated with patient age, gender, differentiation level, and tumor
locale (data not shown). However, there is a trend toward
increased expression of IBABP-L from stage I to stage II to IV
adenocarcinoma.
An IBABP-L–specific antiserum was raised against the peptide
CTWVSRKGDLQRMKQTHKGKPPSS, which falls within the 49
NH2-terminal residues that are unique to IBABP-L. The resulting
antiserum selectively detected IBABP-L but not IBABP by Western
blot analysis. The protein expression of IBABP-L was then
investigated using the validated antiserum with tissue sections of

human colorectal adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal
mucosa. The microscopic view of two patient samples is shown at
several magnifications (Fig. 5). IBABP-L is weakly expressed in
some normal epithelial cells. In contrast, nearly all of the cancer
cells stained positively and strongly for IBABP-L. The IBABP-L
staining is confined to a region close to nucleus on the apical side
of both normal and neoplastic cells. These data strongly support
that IBABP-L protein is increased in colorectal cancer.
IBABP-L is necessary for the survival of HCT116 colon
cancer cells in the presence of DCA. Studies were conducted to
determine if IBABP-L has a role in conferring bile acid resistance in
colon cancer cells. As a model system, we chose the HCT116 colon
cancer cell line because it expresses high levels of IBABP-L but
barely detectable levels of IBABP (Fig. 6A). Therefore, this cell
line recapitulates the expression pattern of IBABP-L and IBABP
that we observe in human colon cancer tissue. RNA interference
was used to knock down the expression of IBABP-L in HCT116
cells. Quantification of mRNA encoding IBABP-L showed that the
expression was reduced by 50% and that this level of repression
was maintained 4 days. Two days after the knockdown of IBABP-L,
the cells were incubated with 100 Amol/L DCA for 24 h, and the
number of cells undergoing apoptosis was determined. The level
of apoptosis in cells where IBABP-L was knocked down was
substantially higher than that in cells transfected with scrambled
shRNA or other control groups (Fig. 6B). We found nearly identical
results when activation levels of caspase-8 and caspase-9 were

analyzed (see Supplementary Fig. S1). This observation is consistent with reports in the literature showing that DCA activates
both caspases (26).

Discussion
Both bile acids and NF-nB have been shown to have a role in
colorectal cancer. In the present study, we identify a new transcript
of the gene encoding IBABP, called IBABP-L, which provides a
missing mechanistic link between NF-nB and bile acids. In
colorectal cancer, IBABP-L is up-regulated by NF-nB and this upregulation seems to be necessary for resistance of colon cancer
cells to bile acid–induced apoptosis. Together, these findings
suggest the existence of a bile acid response pathway controlled
by NF-nB and requiring IBABP-L that is essential for the survival
of colon cancer cells in the presence of secondary bile acids.

Figure 4. Up-regulation of IBABP-L mRNA in colorectal cancer. Total RNA
was isolated from 68 sets of matched human colorectal and adjacent normal
mucosa and used as template in a two-step quantitative RT-PCR procedure as
described in Materials and Methods. Specific primer sets were used to quantify
mRNA encoding IBABP-L, IBABP, and total IBABP. The qPCR was done in
duplicate, and values were normalized to expression of ARPP0 before
calculating the fold change. Statistical analysis was done using one-way
ANOVA. Points, value of individual patient; long bars, mean; short bars, SE.
A, the differential expression of IBABP, IBABP-L, and total IBABP from 68
adenocarcinomas and matched normal mucosa is presented as fold change of
IBABP variants between cancer and normal tissues. Note that total IBABP
up-regulation in adenocarcinomas is entirely contributed by IBABP-L. B, the fold
change of IBABP-L was grouped by clinical stage and statistical analysis was
done. The fold change of IBABP-L in stage I and stage II to IV adenocarcinoma is
statistically significant (P < 0.05).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

The fact that IBABP-L is up-regulated in colorectal cancer forces
a reinterpretation of two prior studies that reported that the
shorter transcript of IBABP is up-regulated in colorectal cancer
(14, 15). Those studies were done without knowledge of IBABP-L
so the PCR-based studies were done with primers that failed to
distinguish between the two forms of IBABP. Our work shows that
the up-regulation previously attributed to IBABP is actually the
up-regulation of IBABP-L. We found the mRNA level for IBABP-L is
on average 30-fold higher in colorectal cancer tissue than in
matched normal tissue, whereas the levels of IBABP remained
negligible; the IBABP-L protein is also up-regulated in colorectal
cancer.
There are several important distinctions between IBABP and
IBABP-L. First, the proteins have distinct NH2 termini. Because
there are six potential methionine start sites in the predicted NH2terminal peptide of IBABP-L, we have yet to pinpoint the precise
NH2 terminus, but the open reading frame encodes 49 residues
following the initiator ATG that are absent in IBABP. A polyclonal
antibody raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to
residues 25 to 49 was reactive with IBABP-L, so we conclude that
some of this region is present in IBABP-L. Additional analysis will
be required to define the exact NH2 terminus.
IBABP and IBABP-L are also differentially expressed in normal
intestinal tissue. Whereas IBABP is highly expressed in the region
of the normal intestine extending from the jejunum to the
ascending colon, the expression of IBABP-L in normal intestine is
several orders of magnitude lower. Interestingly though, in the
limited number of samples we could obtain, the IBABP-L protein is
highly expressed in human fetal intestine (data not shown),
suggesting that the protein may have a role in development.
Perhaps, the most important distinction between IBABP and
IBABP-L is the way in which their expression is regulated. IBABP is
part of the FXR transcription pathway (23) that responds to bile
acids and regulates their reabsorption across the ileum. In contrast,
IBABP-L is not regulated by FXR; it is regulated by NF-nB. One of
the paradoxical findings in the literature on IBABP is the
observation that it is up-regulated in colorectal cancer, whereas
its key regulator FXR is down-regulated (14). The discovery that
the seeming up-regulation of IBABP is actually up-regulation of
IBABP-L and the fact that this transcript is regulated by NF-nB
resolve this paradox.
In addition to the differential expression and regulation of
IBABP-L, we provide a biological function for IBABP-L in colon
tumorigenesis; IBABP-L is necessary for the survival of colon
cancer cells in the presence of physiologic levels of DCA, a toxic
secondary bile acid (27). The concentration of DCA in the fecal
water of normal subjects is f100 Amol/L (3). We observed that
colon cancer cells are resistant to cell death induced by these levels
of DCA; however, when the expression of IBABP-L is knocked
down, the cells undergo apoptosis. IBABP-L is also necessary for
survival of cells in the presence of concentrations of DCA observed
in colorectal cancer patients, f2-fold higher than normal levels
(28). These observations show that IBABP-L promotes survival of
colorectal cancer cells in the presence of toxic bile acids and is
likely to contribute to colon tumorigenesis.
The intriguing link between bile acids, NF-nB, and IBABP-L may
provide a novel target for intervention in colorectal cancer. In
conjunction with the findings in the literature, our study indicates
that IBABP-L is up-regulated as a result of the constitutive
activation of NF-nB in colorectal cancer (29, 30). This coupling of
NF-nB and IBABP-L enables colon cancer cells to buffer toxic bile

acids, protecting the cells from apoptosis. IBABP-L can be
exploited as a therapeutic target in two ways. First, inhibitors of
IBABP-L may enhance the chemopreventative and therapeutic
effects of NF-nB inhibitors (31). Second, because IBABP-L is
necessary for tumor cell survival in the presence of bile acids, its
inhibition would be expected to cause tumor cell death in the
colon.

A, HCT116 cells express 13-fold greater levels of IBABP-L mRNA than
IBABP mRNA. B, HCT116 cells are resistant to cell death induced by DCA
(100 Amol/L); knockdown of the expression levels of IBABP-L causes the cells
to become sensitive to DCA-induced cell death.
