ABSTRACT
Despite therapeutic advancement, multiple myeloma (MM) remains incurable
with drug resistance being one of the main challenges in the clinic. Myeloma cells
possess high protein secretory load, leading to increased intracellular endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress. Hence, they are vulnerable to further perturbation to its protein
homeostasis. In studying the therapeutic mechanism of PRIMA-1 (mutant-p53reactivating-agent), we uncovered its novel p53-independent-mechanism that can
be exploited for myeloma. Despite its inability in restoring the wild type-p53 protein
conformation and transcriptional function in the mutant-p53-human-myeloma-cells,
PRIMA-1 was efficacious against myeloma cells with differential p53 genotypes.
Strikingly, cells without p53 expression demonstrated highest drug sensitivity.
Genome-wide gene-expression analysis revealed the involvement of ER stress/UPRpathway in inducing PRIMA-1-toxicity. UPR markers, HSP70, CHOP and GADD34,
were significantly up-regulated, concomitantly with the induction of apoptosis.
Furthermore, there was a global attenuation of protein synthesis, correlated with
phospho-eIF2a up-regulation. Mechanistically, we identified that PRIMA-1 could
cause the demethylation of TP73, through DNMT1 depletion, to subsequently enhance
UPR. Of clinical significance, we observed that PRIMA-1 had additive therapeutic
effects with another UPR-inducing-agent, bortezomib. Importantly, it can partially
re-sensitize bortezomib-resistant cells to bortezomib. Given that MM is already
stressed at the baseline in the ER, our results implicated that PRIMA-1 is a potential
therapeutic option in MM by targeting its Achilles heel.

shown that in MM cases with hemizygous 17p13(del),
the p53 pathway is already attenuated [7], rendering these
patients to be highly resistant to standard therapeutics
[6, 8]. Restoration of the functional p53 signalling is
therefore an important therapeutic strategy in these highrisk disease.
PRIMA-1 (p53 reactivation and induction of massive
apoptosis) is a small molecular drug that was functionally
discovered to reactivate mutant p53 by restoring its WT
(wild type) protein conformation, transcriptional activity
and its ultimate tumour suppressive properties [9, 10].

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most
common haematological malignancy characterized by
abnormal proliferation of antibody-producing-plasma cells
[1]. Although the emergence of novel therapeutics such as
bortezomib has revolutionized the treatment scene in MM,
drug resistance remains inevitable and only about 10% of
patients have a 10-year survival rate [2, 3]. In particular,
patients harbouring TP53 deletion/mutation have very
poor prognosis [4–6]. Importantly, we have previously

Its classical function in reactivating mutant p53 is well
established in human cancers, including breast, lung,
thyroid and ovarian cancer [11–14]. PRIMA-1 was able to
reconstitute p53 activity by inducing the transcription of
various downstream targets such as p21, BAX, PUMA and
NOXA and a consequent mutant-p53-dependent apoptosis
[11, 12, 15].
Due to the promising results generated from
previous in vivo and in vitro studies, PRIMA-1Met (the
more potent derivative) has made its way to Phase I/II
clinical trials [15]. The drug was generally well tolerated
with the cancer cells harvested from several patients were
noted to undergo cell cycle arrest, increased apoptosis, and
up-regulation of p53 target genes.
With this in mind, we tested the therapeutic effects
of PRIMA-1 in a panel of MM cell lines of various p53
functional status. Consistent with some recent reports
[16, 17], we found that PRIMA-1 can effectively kill
myeloma cells independently of their p53 genotype.
Intriguingly, its highest potency was exhibited in cells
with zero p53 expression. High-throughput microarray
analysis and subsequent investigations then unveiled
an important novel mechanism by which PRIMA-1
could kill MM cells, which is via the activation of
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or Unfolded Protein
Response (UPR) pathway that was mediated by p73
demethylation. Given that myeloma cells are by nature
vulnerable to additional ER stress due to its extensive
protein burden in vivo, targeting the ER stress pathway
may be an attractive way to combat the disease. The
novel mechanism of action uncovered in our study
suggests that PRIMA-1 and its derivative may be used in
myeloma to exploit this vulnerability.

IC50s in JJN3 and KMS11 were also found to be much
lower than other HMCLs. Collectively, these data strongly
suggest that p53 (be it WT or mutant) is dispensable for
PRIMA-1 treatment and that its cytotoxicity was most
prevalent in the absence of p53.
To further validate this finding, isogenic p53knockdown-NCI-H929 (sh-Ctrl and sh-p53) [7] were
similarly treated. Indeed, the silencing of p53 rendered
the cells more sensitive towards PRIMA-1 as reflected
by a dramatic reduction in cell survival (Figure 1C)
and significant increase in the percentage of apoptosis
(Figure 1D), thus, further emphasizing the better efficiency
of PRIMA-1 in a p53-null background.
In view of the high IC50 in the p53-mutant HMCLs,
we also examined if PRIMA-1 has any direct effects on
the protein structure of the mutant-p53 proteins. By using
a p53-WT-conformation-specific antibody (PAb 1620), we
identified that PRIMA-1 was not able to restore the p53WT structure (Supplementary Figure S3A). Concordantly,
no changes were seen in the expression levels of p53
transcriptional targets, namely, p21, MDM2 and PUMA,
even when they were treated up to 100uM, indicating that
the transcriptional function of the mutant proteins was not
reinstated (Supplementary Figure S3B).
In other words, the canonical role of PRIMA-1
in rescuing the WT function of mutant-p53 was not
applicable in MM. Since it is found that the p53-null
cells were most sensitive to the drug, this only implied
that factors other than p53 was prevailing in PRIMA-1’s
mechanism of action in MM.

RESULTS

To elucidate the p53-independent mechanism of
PRIMA-1, we performed a systematic genome-wide
GEP analysis in JJN3 and KMS11. Comparing DMSO
versus PRIMA-1-treated samples, we noted a series of
differentially expressed genes encoding the stress and heatshock proteins alongside regulators of cell proliferation,
protein folding and lipid metabolism (Fold change ≥2,
p <0.05). Eighteen differentially expressed genes were
common in both HMCLs (Figure 2A and Supplementary
Figure S4). When validated by PCR, important cancerrelated genes such as NOXA (apoptotic gene), GADD34
(cell cycle regulator) and HSPA1A, HSPA1B (encoding
HSP70 proteins) were up-regulated by at least two folds
upon PRIMA-1 treatment (Figure 2B).
Gene ontology analysis revealed two interesting
signalling pathways that were significantly enriched
upon drug treatment, namely, the unfolded and misfolded
protein responses (Supplementary Table S3). Since
NOXA, GADD34 and HSP70 have also been closely
associated with unfolded protein accumulation [18, 19],
these data strongly support the involvement of UPR in
mediating PRIMA-1 toxicity in MM.

stress pathway/ UPR

PRIMA-1’s non-canonical role in MM
Consistent with previous reports in MM [16, 17],
we found that PRIMA-1 was able to induce growth
inhibition of HMCLs, irrespective of their p53 functional
status (Figure 1A; IC50s in Supplementary Table S1).
Interestingly, JJN3 and KMS11, both with zero p53
mRNA and protein (Supplementary Figure S1), were
noted to be significantly more sensitive to PRIMA-1
than other HMCLs, including those with p53 mutation.
Annexin-V assay also showed the highest degree of
apoptosis in these two HMCLs (Figure 1B). Treatment
with 50uM of PRIMA-1 only managed to kill less than
60% of the cells in the remaining HMCLs. Cell cycle
analysis also revealed the highest sub-G1 population in
PRIMA-1-treated KMS11 and JJN3 (Supplementary
Figure S2). When we treated the same set of HMCLs
with its derivative, PRIMA-1Met, all of them experienced
growth inhibition with generally lower IC50s than its
parental drug (Supplementary Table S2). Consistently, the

To validate our hypothesis, various ER stress
markers were assessed using Western blot analysis.
Indeed, GRP78 (HSP70 family member), necessary for
binding to aggregated unfolded/misfolded proteins in ER,
showed increased expression upon treatment by PRIMA-1
in a time-dependent manner. In addition, PERK and eIF2a
were phosphorylated, and the downstream elements,
CHOP and GADD34, were consequently upregulated, all
of which are hallmarks of ER stress induction (Figure 2C).
This led to the modulation of the pro-apoptotic (NOXA)
and anti-apoptotic (BCL-2 and MCL-1) protein
expression, ultimately triggering a cascade of apoptosis
involving both intrinsic (caspase-9 cleavage) and extrinsic
(caspase-8 cleavage) signalling. Accordingly, PRIMA-1
treatment also caused the induction of UPR markers at the
transcript level (Figure 2D).
As p-eIF2a functions to momentarily attenuate
protein translation for the repair of ER congestion to
commence [20], we examined if PRIMA-1 was able to
stall protein production by performing the SUnSET assay,
a dynamic non-radioactive method utilizing puromycin

to label neo-proteins [21]. PRIMA-1 treatment resulted
in a gradual reduction of global protein synthesis, with a
concomitant increase of p-eIF2a expression (Figure 2E).
This observation was replicated in tunicamycin-treatedfraction (Figure 2E, lane 5) (tunicamycin is a classical ER
stress inducer), thus validating the UPR-inducing effects
of PRIMA-1.
The hallmark of UPR is that cells which are
subjected to insurmountable ER stress would switch from
adaptation to apoptotic state. CHOP has been shown to
be the specific factor mediating this ER stress-induced
apoptosis [22, 23]. In line with this, we proceeded to
knockdown CHOP (Figure 2F). Indeed, depletion of
CHOP resulted in a significantly lower sensitivity to
PRIMA-1, as demonstrated by the higher cell viability in
these cells relatively to the siCtrl cells (Figure 2G). This
finding further confirms that PRIMA-1 cytotoxicity was in
part mediated through the UPR-death inducing pathway.
The other sensitive HMCL, KMS11 also
displayed an activated UPR (Supplementary Figure
S5A), implicating that observation in JJN3 was not

a cell line-specific effect. The less sensitive HMCLs
such as NCI-H929 (p53-WT) and U266 (p53-mutant)
displayed a mild degree of UPR activation, and required
a much higher concentration of PRIMA-1 (~50-100uM)
to manifest this phenotype (Supplementary Figure
S5B). This further corroborates the importance of
UPR activation in mediating PRIMA-1 cytotoxicity in
myeloma cells.

XBP1 splicing is the hallmark for IRE1 activation
and has been reported to be an early event in UPR [24].
Figure 3A showed that XBP1 was undergoing only a subtle
splicing at the 12th and 24th hour, as demonstrated by faint
XBP1s bands. In contrast, tunicamycin treatment of a
mere 6 hours was sufficient to create an intense splicing.
The IRE1/XBP1 route was described to be crucial for
differentiation and survival of plasma cells [25, 26], thus,
we postulated that PRIMA-1 may be exerting its antimyeloma role by inhibiting the pro-survival effects of IRE1/
XBP1. Indeed, we observed that PRIMA-1 treatment could
partially rescue tunicamycin-induced-XBP1s (Figure 3B,
lane 4), an indication of the suppression of IRE1 activity.
On the other hand, ATF6 reporter assay revealed a
non-significant increase of luciferase activity upon PRIMA-1
treatment (Figure 3C), suggesting that ATF6 network may not
be important in PRIMA-1’s mechanism of action.
Taken together, these assays denoted that PRIMA-1
may be exerting its cytotoxicity by inhibiting the prosurvival arm of IRE1 to amplify the pro-apoptotic
response from PERK activation.

PRIMA-1 activated PERK, suppressed IRE1 and
has no significant effect on ATF6 arms of UPR
Because UPR constitutes three inter-linked networks
mediated by transmembrane protein sensors, namely,
IRE1, PERK and ATF6 [20], we sought to know which
one is the main target of PRIMA-1. Our earlier results
suggested that the PERK network was involved, as shown
by the induction of its downstream elements, such as
p-PERK, p-eIF2a, ATF4, CHOP and GADD34. CHOP
(transcription target of ATF4) knockdown also diminished
PRIMA-1-induced-cytotoxicity.

High basal intracellular ER stress is important
for PRIMA-1-induced-toxicity

treatment of U266 with tunicamycin essentially sensitized
the cells to the subsequent PRIMA-1 exposure, whereby
a significant increase in apoptosis was recorded (Figure
4B and 4C). This is also in keeping with the expression
profile of the UPR markers which showed up-regulation
of five to 10 folds when the tunicamycin-pre-treated cells
were subsequently incubated with PRIMA-1 (Figure 4A).
Therefore, this indicates that inflating the baseline ER
stress level by tunicamycin prior to PRIMA-1 treatment
could lead to the intensification of UPR, culminating in
cellular toxicity. This finding clearly demonstrated the
importance of basal ER stress level in bringing about
effective apoptosis in response to PRIMA-1 treatment.

Because MM plasma cells must be able to sustain
high intracellular ER stress for survival and proliferation
due to its high secretory load [20, 27], we postulated that
cells with a higher baseline ER stress (lower threshold
for UPR induction) would be more easily sensitized to
PRIMA-1-induced-apoptosis.
To prove this hypothesis, we utilised a less sensitive
HMCL, U266. Firstly, we heightened their basal ER
stress level prior to PRIMA-1 treatment. Tunicamycin,
is known to disrupt N-linked glycosylation of nascent
proteins [28], thus, was used to induce unfolded protein
accumulation. As shown in Figure 4A, single treatment of
either tunicamycin or PRIMA-1 triggered only a marginal
UPR activation, as indicated by increased of two to
three folds of UPR markers. This corresponded with the
minimal apoptosis response observed in the cells of single
treatments (Figure 4B and 4C). On the other hand, pre-

PRIMA-1-induced-p73 led to the enhancement
of UPR
Because PRIMA-1 was more toxic in the absence
of p53, we hypothesized that p73, being its homologue,
may act as a surrogate TSG (tumor suppressor gene).

stress markers after U266 was treated with either tunicamycin or PRIMA-1 or combination of both. For combination treatment, U266 was

Importantly, Saha et al. has previously highlighted the role
of p73 in PRIMA-1-induced-apoptosis [16]. Moreover,
p73 has also been associated with elevation of intracellular
ER stress through functional incorporation of scotin [29].
Thus, it was highly relevant to interrogate if p73 was
associated with PRIMA-1-induced-UPR in myeloma.
In concordance with the literature, we also found
distinct increase of p73 at both the mRNA and protein
levels upon PRIMA-1 treatment (Supplementary Figure
S6A). In the range of HMCLs tested, p73 is generally low
at the basal level, however, we can see a trend whereby
cells with higher sensitivity to PRIMA-1 (JJN3 and
KMS11) have relatively higher levels of p73 mRNA as
compared to cells with lower sensitivity (Supplementary
Figure S6B). At the protein level, even though p73
was barely detectable at the baseline in both JJN3 and
KMS11, its expression was markedly upregulated upon
PRIMA-1 treatment. All other cell lines, albeit seem
to also demonstrate an increased expression of p73 in
response to PRIMA-1 treatment, the upregulation was
either subtle or almost negligible than in the sensitive
cell lines (Supplementary Figure S6C), concurring
that p73 has an important role in mediating PRIMA-1induced-toxicity. As expected, loss of p73 expression
via siRNA knockdown compromised its induction upon
drug treatment (Figure 5A). Lower rate of p73 induction
indicates that its expression level was not sufficient to
trigger the downstream effects.
Importantly, silencing p73 did not only confer the
cells a compromised apoptotic response (lesser c-PARP)
(Figure 5B), but the PRIMA-1-induced-upregulation of
the ER stress markers were also significantly rescued
(Figure 5C). In turn, p73 overexpression (Figure 5D)
resulted in an enhancement of the expression level of
UPR markers (Figure 5E), accompanied by greater growth
inhibition (Figure 5F). These findings implicate the role
of p73 in mediating the ER activity and in sustaining the
UPR required for the cytotoxicity of PRIMA-1 in MM.

Besides DNMT1, the expression levels of DNMT3A
was also checked upon PRIMA-1 treatment. There was
a slight downregulation (~20%) of DNMT3A transcript
level at the 6th and 12th hour (Supplementary Figure
S6D) but the downtrend was abolished come 24th hour.
Based on these results, it may indicate that both DNMT1
and DNMT3A may act collaboratively in the early time
point but complete demethylation of the target gene was
mediated predominantly by DNMT1.

Clinical significance of PRIMA-1 treatment
When we treated primary patient samples with
PRIMA-1, they experienced a gradual growth inhibition
with increasing dosage (Figure 7A). Consistent with
HMCL observations, absence of p53 expression
apparently conferred higher amount of apoptosis (c-PARP)
in both N073 and T019 as compared with N099 and T011
(Figure 7B). This further confirms that even in clinical
samples, PRIMA-1’s activity is independent of p53 and
was more effective in MM cells without p53 expression.
Importantly, the cytotoxicity profile in the patient samples
also corresponded well with robust UPR activation
(Figure 7C).
Bortezomib, being the novel anti-myeloma agent,
has also been reported to induce the UPR activation [27,
32]. More importantly, previous studies have suggested
that the sensitivity to bortezomib is dependent on a
cellular state where UPR is activated [33]. These raised
the possibility that if PRIMA-1 can elevate ER stress to
induce UPR in myeloma cells, then it could sensitize them
to bortezomib and that the combination would be more
effective (same concept as Figure 4).
To test this hypothesis, we utilized the previously
generated bortezomib-resistant HMCL, RPMI-8226P100V. This HMCL was resistant to bortezomib of up to
50nM (Supplementary Figure S7A), whereas its parental
cell line, RPMI-8226 has a low IC50 of only 4nM (data
not shown). Similar to RPMI-8226, PRIMA-1 treatment
was effective in inducing growth inhibition of P100V in
a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure S7B).
Essentially, when P100V was treated with a combination
of PRIMA-1 and bortezomib, we observed an enhanced
depression in cell survival (Figure 7D). Combination
index (CI) was approximately 1.0, suggesting an additive
effect for both drugs. This set of data highlighted not only
the efficacy of PRIMA-1 in targeting bortezomib resistant
cases, but also underlined the likelihood of PRIMA-1
restoring bortezomib sensitivity in myeloma.
To probe into this possibility, P100V was pre-treated
with PRIMA-1 and was then allowed to recover for 6
hours before they were being incubated with bortezomib
(Figure 7E). This strategy was intended to elevate the
basal ER stress and disrupt the UPR equilibrium first
before exposing the cells to solely bortezomib. Indeed,
pre-treatment with PRIMA-1 caused an increased rate of

PRIMA-1-induced-p73 was associated with
demethylation of TP73
Because TP73 was reported to be commonly
silenced by promoter hypermethylation in cancers [30,
31], we proceeded to check if the p73 up-regulation by
PRIMA-1 was mediated by demethylation. To clarify this
hypothesis, methylation specific PCR (MSP) analysis
was performed and indeed, methylated TP73 showed
consistent down-regulation with a simultaneous upregulation of its demethylated counterpart, upon PRIMA-1
treatment (Figure 6A). Concordantly, there was a reduction
of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) at both the mRNA
(Figure 6B) and protein (Figure 6C) levels, suggesting
that there was an association of PRIMA-1-induced-TP73
demethylation through the attenuation of DNMT1 activity,
leading to downstream activation of UPR.

apoptosis in the bortezomib only-treated cells (compare
Figure 7E-5 and 7E-6), indicating that the effect seen in
7E-6 was solely due to the actions of bortezomib since
PRIMA-1 has been completely rid of (from the overnight
recovery). This underlines the potential re-sensitizing role
of PRIMA-1 to bortezomib.
To further establish the importance of PRIMA-1
and bortezomib partnership, drug combination study
was then extended to other HMCLs. In JJN3, a low
dosage treatment of single agent PRIMA-1 (10uM) and
bortezomib rendered the cells to have 20% and 30%
of reduction in cell viability, respectively. Strikingly,
combination treatment of both drugs led to significantly
reduced cell survival (Figure 7F). Additive effects were

recorded at the concentrations tested, with CI~1. To
determine if the enhanced cytotoxicity was the result
of the amplified UPR, we assessed the UPR markers
upon combination treatment. True enough, concomitant
treatment significantly intensified the expression of
HSP70, CHOP, GADD34 and NOXA relatively to the
single-agent-treated-cells (Figure 7G and 7H).
Similarly, combination treatment was also
performed in the NCI-H929 (p53-WT) and RPMI-8226
(p53-Mut) and the sensitivity of the cells to PRIMA-1
was efficiently increased in the presence of bortezomib
(Supplementary Figure S7C), suggesting that PRIMA-1
could co-operate with the latter for enhanced cytotoxicity,
presumably by magnifying the UPR activity.

DISCUSSION

Our study unveiled the perturbation of the UPR
as a novel mechanism by which PRIMA-1 exerts its
cytotoxicity in MM. We saw a robust induction of various
ER stress markers, namely, HSP70, CHOP, GADD34
and NOXA in HMCLs and patient samples. Additionally,
we also observed a global reduction of protein synthesis,
consistent with the function of UPR in re-establishing
intracellular protein homeostasis, thus, implicating that
PRIMA-1 cytotxicity in MM cells was to a large extent
working through the UPR pathway. Attesting to our
findings, the association of ER stress with PRIMA-1 has
actually been briefly reported before in osteosarcoma,
nonetheless, it was a mutant-p53-dependent event [38].
Importantly, our finding was relevant in the context of
MM because these malignant plasma cells being involved
in excessive immunoglobulin production, naturally has an
almost-saturated level of cytoprotective UPR mechanism,
thus, they are more easily sensitized to the induction
of terminal UPR in response to additional ER stress by
exogenous agents such as PRIMA-1.
We have demonstrated that the intracellular ER
stress level was critical for PRIMA-1’s therapeutic

PRIMA-1 is a first-in-class mutant-p53-reactivating
agent that has made its way to the Phase I/II clinical trials
[15, 34]. This drug demonstrated proof-of-concept that
mutant p53 can be rescued and restored to the function of
a WT in killing cancer cells. Despite its well established
efficacy in cancer cells with p53 mutation, other studies
have suggested p53-independent mechanisms. Cells
from osteosarcoma, prostate cancer and hepatocellular
carcinoma of either p53-WT or p53-null status, were
efficiently killed by PRIMA-1 [9, 35, 36]. Of important
relevance, this drug was also reported to be effective in
blood malignancies, irrespective of p53 status, in AML,
B-CLL and MM [16, 17, 37]. Nonetheless, its mechanism
of action has yet to be clearly elucidated. These reports
collectively erected an important platform for further
interrogation of the p53-independent mechanisms of
PRIMA-1. This is crucial given that PRIMA-1 has been
described to potentially activate various apoptosisinducing pathways, giving rise to its essential multifaceted functions [38].

mechanism in MM. Only in the presence of tunicamycin
to pre-induce unfolded protein accumulation that the
less sensitive HMCL (U266) could undergo significantly
higher PRIMA-1-induced-apoptosis, accompanied by
concomitant increase of UPR markers. This essentially
means that tunicamycin sets the base for PRIMA-1 to
further impose ER stress, tipping the homeostasis balance
in favour of apoptosis. In relation to this, we propose that
a certain threshold of ER stress needs to be surpassed for
PRIMA-1 to be effective. Supporting this hypothesis,
bortezomib (acting similiarly as PRIMA-1), was also
apparently more effective in targeting MM cells with

higher immunoglobulin production (higher basal ER
stress) [32].
Previously, p73 was identified to be important
for PRIMA-1 cytoxicity in myeloma [16]. We further
extended this finding by demonstrating that p73 induction
could result from the down-regulation of DNMT1, leading
to a subsequent demethylation of TP73, and a sustained
UPR activity. The fact that our p53-null study models
were most sensitive to the drug makes our data all the
more relevant as absence of p53 could trigger its family
member, p73, to act as a surrogate TSG. Supporting our
findings, a recent study on thyroid cancer has reported

that PRIMA-1Met was indeed able to induce global
DNA demethylation and upregulation of various tumor
suppressors [39].
Another study in MM has revealed the association
between PRIMA-1Met and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
[17]. Consistently, we also found that ROS is induced
upon PRIMA-1 treatment but it was a downstream event
of UPR. Evident elevation of ROS marker was observed
only at the 16th hour onwards upon PRIMA-1 treatment
(Supplementary Figure S5C), whereas UPR markers were
already upregulated at the 6th hour (Figure 2C). Given that
ROS has been consistently linked to ER stress-induced
apoptosis in cancer [40, 41], it is conceivable that all these
factors are inter-connected to form a dynamic network
in driving the eventual PRIMA-1 cytotoxicity in MM
(Supplementary Figure S8).
At the molecular level, PRIMA-1 was reported
to restore the functional p53 protein conformation
and phenotypic activity through its active compound,
methylene quinuclidinone (MQ) that binds to and forms
adduct with the cysteine residues (Cys) of mutant p53
proteins [10]. While we did not observe this phenotype
in the p53-mutant MM cells, it is plausible that MQ could
also bind to other proteins (such as p73 in our case), since
all intracellular proteins potentially contain Cys, and
cause modifications, which may then affect cellular milieu
and protein homeostasis. We speculate that this could at
least, in part, explain why PRIMA-1 could trigger UPR,
bringing about p53-independent-apoptosis. Supporting
this theory, the ability of PRIMA-1/MQ binding to other
proteins (TrxR1 and glutathione) has been reported
previously [42, 43].
Regarding why PRIMA-1 was more efficacious in
the absence of p53 expression, it is likely that p53, being
the guardian of the genome, will protect genome integrity
by suppressing stress, including that in the ER, that is
required by PRIMA-1 to kill the MM cells. Furthermore,
as p73 was found to be essential in its mechanism of
action, the presence of p53 may possibly suppress the
effects of p73. This hypothesis is in line with mutant p53’s
gain-of-function role of binding to TA-p73, rendering
the latter functionally defective [44, 45]. Nevertheless,
these possibilities have to be carefully interrogated and is
beyond the scope of current study.
Clinically speaking, since we have shown that
myeloma cells lacking p53 expression were more sensitive
to the drug, we strongly feel that the high risk 17p13(del)
patients who experience p53 haploinsufficiency and total
abolishment of p53 expression [7] could potentially benefit
from this drug. Our finding corroborates with a previous
observation in AML in which hemizygous 17p13(del)
subgroup was more sensitive to PRIMA-1 [46]. Moreover,
the fact that PRIMA-1 was effective against all the
HMCLs tested, irrespective of their p53 status (albeit at
higher concentrations), really underscores its versatility in
targeting myeloma cases with different genetic alterations.

It is understandable if one is concerned about the
relatively high PRIMA-1 dosage required for its efficacy.
However, previous reports have ruled out its toxicity effects
in the xenograft system (the mice were administered with
high doses of the drug, up to 100mg/kg) [11, 12] as well as
in the bone marrow and hematopoetic progenitor cells [15,
16]. Of paramount importance, the first-in-human study
with PRIMA-1Met has reported 60mg/kg as the maximum
tolerated dose, which corresponds to a maximum plasma
concentration of about 300uM [15]. In our study, we already
saw a complete eradication of the MM cells at 100uM in all
the HMCLs tested. This simply means that efficient killing of
MM can already be achieved at a dosage that is substantially
lower than the reported maximum tolerated dose.
In addition, we have shown that PRIMA-1’s
combination with bortezomib could induce significant
growth inhibition in HMCLs. Since bortezomib has also
been associated with the involvement of UPR in MM [27,
47], we believe that combination of both drugs could cause
major perturbation to the UPR, thus, driving the cells into
major pro-apoptotic state. Importantly, we observed that
bortezomib-resistant cells were also sensitive to PRIMA-1.
As the clinical efficacy of bortezomib is often impeded
by eventual resistance, our finding denotes that PRIMA-1
may possibly be an important bortezomib re-sensitizing
agent, however, the optimum dosage of both drugs needs
to be prudently scrutinised. Although PRIMA-1 has been
reported to synergize with various cytotoxic drugs such as
dexamethasone, doxorubicin and cisplatin [14, 16, 48], to
the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to report
the novel efficacy of PRIMA-1-bortezomib combination.
In conclusion, we have unveiled a novel mechanism
by which PRIMA-1 could exert its cytotoxicity in MM
cells, which is via the UPR/ER stress pathway. This
denotes that PRIMA-1’s mechanism of action is actually
much more diverse than previously thought, underlining
its promising role in targeting various tumor suppressor
pathways and its versatility in keeping drug resistance at
bay. Essentially, the double-edged sword properties of
UPR provides a good channel for therapeutic manipulation
in cancer. Because high ER stress level remains one of
the hallmarks of MM, exploiting this Achilles heel of the
disease would represent an attractive therapeutic strategy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) and
primary myeloma cells
All HMCLs used have been previously characterized
[7]. For primary myeloma cells, the blood or bone marrow
samples were collected from patients after obtaining
informed consent, in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki. Plasma cells were isolated through FicollHypaque centrifugation system and were purified with
CD138 immunomagnetic beads (Stemcell Technologies,

sequences [49]. PCR products were visualized on a 2.5%
agarose gel.

Drug treatment

Luciferase reporter assay

All drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and are stored at -20C. PRIMA-1 was purchased
from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Tunicamycin
and 5-Azacytidine were bought from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis,
MO, USA). Bortezomib was obtained from the clinic. Cells
were seeded at 0.25x106 cells/mL prior to treatment.

Cells were transfected with Cignal ERSE (ER stress
response element) reporter (Qiagen, Venlo, Limburg,
Netherlands) and was treated 24 hours post-transfection.
Detailed procedure is described in the Supplementary
Information.

Surface Sensing Of Translation (SUnSET) assay

Cell viability and apoptosis assay

Upon the completion of timepoint treatment, the
cells were incubated 30 min in medium containing 1
μM puromycin. Cells were harvested and total protein
extraction was performed as per standard protocol. Cell
lysates were subjected to conventional Western blotting
using anti-puromycin antibody.

Cell viability of MM cells was determined
by using MTS (3-(4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium)
assay [7]. Rate of apoptosis was checked by using AnnexinV-FITC assay (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA)
according to manufacturer’s protocol. Percentage specific
apoptosis was calculated as previously described [7].
Protein levels of cleaved-PARP and cleaved-caspases-8,-9
and -3 were used as a semi-quantitative gauge for apoptosis.

Statistical and bioinformatics analysis
All statistical analyses were done with Independent
T-test, assuming normal distribution of mean. IC50s
were analyzed using CompuSyn (Combosyn, Inc.,
Paramus, NJ, USA). Gene Ontology (GO) pathway
analysis was conducted using DAVID, v6.7 (Database
for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery)
(National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, MD).
All statistical data are presented as mean ± standard
deviation.

Gene silencing and overexpression
p53 stable knockdown NCI-H929 has been generated
previously [7]. Introduction of either sip73 (Dharmacon,
Lafayatte, CO, USA) or pCDNA-p73 (Addgene,
Cambridge, MA, USA) was performed using Neon
Transfection System (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Transfection was done at 0.5x106 cells/mL density,
followed by drug treatment 48 hours post-transfection.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Gene expression microarray analysis

The authors disclose no potential conflicts of interest.

Gene expression profiling (GEP) was done on
Affymetrix platform (Santa Clara, CA, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Differentially expressed
genes of at least 2-folds (p<0.05) upon PRIMA-1 treatment
were identified. Only overlapping up/downregulated genes
in both HMCLs (JJN3 and KMS11) were considered
specific for PRIMA-1 activity.
