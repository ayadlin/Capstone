mTOR inhibitor efficacy is determined by the eIF4E/4E-BP ratio
Tommy Alain, Nahum Sonenberg and Ivan Topisirovic
The mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin
(mTOR) is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase
that is hyperactivated in cancer [1]. mTOR forms two
distinct complexes, mTORC1 and 2. mTORC1 stimulates
translation and perturbs energy metabolism to drive cell
proliferation and growth, whereas mTORC2 regulates
cytoskeletal organization and cell survival by stimulating
AGC kinases (e.g. AKT). Therefore, suppressing mTOR’s
activity is widely considered as a very attractive anticancer therapy. Accordingly, mTOR inhibitors are
increasingly used as anti-neoplastic agents in the clinic.
Rapamycin is a naturally occurring allosteric
inhibitor of mTORC1 and its analogs (rapalogs) are used
as anti-cancer agents for the treatment of refractory renal
cell carcinomas, mantle cell lymphomas, and pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors. However, success of rapalogs as
anti-cancer monotherapies is limited [2]. This has been
attributed to the activation of AKT signaling resulting
from the loss of a negative-feedback mechanism, as
well as rapamycin-resistant mTORC1 outputs, such as
the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor
4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs).
To overcome these deficiencies a new generation
of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors [also referred
to as dual mTORC1/2 inhibitors or active-site mTOR
inhibitors (asTORi)] was developed [2]. asTORi suppress
AKT signaling by inhibiting mTORC2, and abrogate
rapamycin-resistant mTORC1 outputs including the
phosphorylation of 4E-BPs. Accordingly, asTORi exhibit
stronger anti-proliferative and anti-tumorigenic effects
as compared to rapalogs, and are currently in multiple
clinical trials aiming to target aberrant mTOR signaling in
cancer [2]. However, a major obstacle to applying asTORi
to the clinic is a lack of predictive biomarkers that would
facilitate the stratification of the patients that are most
likely to respond to these drugs. Discovery of predictive
biomarkers indicative of the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors
is hampered by the complexity of the mTOR pathway,
given that mTOR controls a variety of cellular processes
via a multitude of substrates.
4E-BPs are a family of small translational
repressors, which sequester the 5’ mRNA cap-binding
protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)-4E
(eIF4E), thereby impeding the assembly of the eIF4F
complex. The eIF4F complex, which consists of eIF4E,
scaffolding protein eIF4G and the DEAD-box helicase
eIF4A, recruits the mRNA to the ribosome to initiate
translation. mTORC1 phosphorylates and inactivates

4E-BPs, thereby facilitating the assembly of the eIF4F
complex and translation initiation (See Figure 1).
eIF4E acts as a general translation initiation factor, but
a subset of mRNAs referred to as “eIF4E-sensitive” are
particularly sensitive to changes in eIF4E activity. These
mRNAs encode tumor-promoting factors, such as cyclin
D3, ornithine decarboxylase and myc. The inability of
rapalogs to completely suppress 4E-BP phosphorylation
and translation of “eIF4E-sensitive” mRNAs is thought to
be the reason for their relatively limited anti-tumorigenic
efficacy in the clinic [2, 3].
Overexpression of eIF4E and variations in 4EBP levels and phosphorylation are frequently observed
in tumors, thereby suggesting that eIF4E/4E-BP
stoichiometry may significantly differ among patients, or
even within a single tumor [4]. We demonstrated that the
eIF4E/4E-BP ratio determines the ability of asTORi to
suppress neoplastic growth [5]. Resistance of malignant
cells with high eIF4E/4E-BP ratio to asTORi can be
explained by their deficiency to inhibit eIF4F complex
assembly and translation of “eIF4E-sensitive” mRNAs
(Figure 1). We also showed that cancer cells acquire
resistance to asTORi by increasing eIF4E availability via
downregulation of 4E-BP1 and 2. These data corroborate
earlier findings showing that the amplification of the eIF4E
gene underlies resistance to the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
BEZ235 [6], and that eIF4E translation activity can predict
sensitivity to rapalogs [3]. Therefore, eIF4E/4E-BP ratio,
rather than individual levels or phosphorylation status
of these proteins, is more likely to serve as a prognostic
biomarker to select the patients for clinical trials using
asTORi and to tailor personalized mTOR targeted
therapies.
Recently, several mechanisms potentiating
resistance to mTOR inhibitors emerged, including the
activation of alternative signaling pathways such as the
MAPK pathway [7]. Therefore, combined targeting of
the mTOR and MAPK pathways has been suggested as
a promising approach to overcome resistance to mTOR
inhibitors in the clinic. In addition to this strategy, our
findings suggest that combining therapeutic approaches
that suppress eIF4E expression or activity (e.g. ISISEIF4ERx, 4EGI-1, or 4E1RCat [8]) with mTOR targeted
therapies should be beneficial in patients bearing tumors
with elevated eIF4E/4E-BP ratio.

Figure 1: Sensitivity of tumor to asTORi as a function of eIF4E/4E-BP ratio. mTORC1 phosphorylates and inactivates

4E-BPs, thereby stimulating translation of “eIF4E-sensitive” mRNAs and driving cell proliferation and growth. asTORi abrogate the
phosphorylation of 4E-BPs by mTORC1 leading to reduction in translation of “eIF4E-sensitive” mRNAs. However, in cancer cells with
elevated eIF4E/4E-BP ratio (red rectangle), inhibition of translation of “eIF4E-sensitive” mRNAs by asTORi is incomplete and insufficient
to suppress neoplastic growth. In turn, in malignant cells exhibiting low eIF4E/4E-BP ratio (green rectangle), asTORi abolish “eIF4Esensitive” mRNA translation and suppress neoplastic growth. ORF: open reading frame.
