Abstract
Overexpression of the prosurvival Bcl-2 family members
(Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) is commonly associated with tumor
maintenance, progression, and chemoresistance. We previously reported the discovery of ABT-737, a potent, smallmolecule Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor. A major limitation of
ABT-737 is that it is not orally bioavailable, which would limit
chronic single agent therapy and flexibility to dose in
combination regimens. Here we report the biological properties of ABT-263, a potent, orally bioavailable Bad-like BH3
mimetic (K i’s of <1 nmol/L for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w). The
oral bioavailability of ABT-263 in preclinical animal models
is 20% to 50%, depending on formulation. ABT-263 disrupts
Bcl-2/Bcl-xL interactions with pro-death proteins (e.g., Bim),
leading to the initiation of apoptosis within 2 hours posttreatment. In human tumor cells, ABT-263 induces Bax translocation, cytochrome c release, and subsequent apoptosis.
Oral administration of ABT-263 alone induces complete tumor
regressions in xenograft models of small-cell lung cancer
and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In xenograft models of
aggressive B-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma where
ABT-263 exhibits modest or no single agent activity, it
significantly enhances the efficacy of clinically relevant
therapeutic regimens. These data provide the rationale for
clinical trials evaluating ABT-263 in small-cell lung cancer and
B-cell malignancies. The oral efficacy of ABT-263 should
provide dosing flexibility to maximize clinical utility both as a
single agent and in combination regimens. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer (1). Cancer cells
must overcome a continual bombardment by cellular stresses such
as DNA damage, oncogene activation, aberrant cell cycle
progression, and harsh microenvironments that would cause
normal cells to undergo apoptosis. One of the primary means by
which cancer cells evade apoptosis is by up-regulation of the
prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1
(1, 2). Thus, a variety of approaches to target these oncoproteins
have been pursued to restore the natural process of programmed
cell death (3).

We recently described the design of small molecules that occupy
the BH3 binding groove of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members,
which culminated in the discovery of ABT-737 (4–6). ABT-737 binds
with high affinity (<1 nmol/L) to Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bcl-w; exhibits
single-agent activity against small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and
lymphoid malignancies; and potentiates the proapoptotic effects of
several therapeutic agents in a broader context (7–16). In addition
to established human tumor cell lines, ABT-737 effectively induces
apoptosis in primary patient-derived lymphoma and chronic
lymphocytic leukemia cells ex vivo (12, 17).
However, the prospects for ABT-737 as a therapeutic agent are
hampered by its poor physiochemical and pharmaceutical properties. This compound is not orally bioavailable and its low aqueous
solubility makes formulation for i.v. delivery challenging. In
xenograft models, ABT-737 exhibits maximal monotherapy efficacy
when given by i.p. injection on a continuous daily schedule. Because
continuous administration of a parenteral agent in the clinical
setting is problematic, we sought an orally bioavailable agent with
the pharmacologic properties of ABT-737. We believe that such an
agent will maximize clinical utility as a single agent and more
readily enable combination with standard chemotherapeutics.
Here, we report the biological properties of our secondgeneration, orally bioavailable BH3 mimetic, ABT-263. ABT-263
exhibits selective cytotoxicity to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL–dependent cells
in vitro. When dosed p.o. in vivo, ABT-263 elicits complete tumor
regressions in SCLC and ALL xenograft models as well as
potentiates the therapeutic efficacy of commonly used chemotherapeutic regimens in B-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma
xenograft models. These results have provided the rationale and
strategy for ongoing clinical studies.

Materials and Methods
Compound synthesis and affinity determination. ABT-737 and
ABT-263 were synthesized as previously described (12, 18). The enantiomer
and BH3-only peptides were synthesized at Abbott (Abbott Park, IL).
Binding affinities (K i or IC50) were determined with competitive fluorescence polarization assays (19). The following peptide probe/protein pairs
were used: f-bad (1 nmol/L) and Bcl-xL (6 nmol/L), f-Bax (1 nmol/L) and
Bcl-2 (10 nmol/L), f-Bax (1 nmol/L) and Bcl-w (40 nmol/L), f-Noxa (2 nmol/L)
and Mcl-1 (40 nmol/L), and f-Bax (1 nmol/L) and Bcl-2-A1 (15 nmol/L).
Binding affinities for Bcl-xL were also determined using a time-resolved
fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. Bcl-xL (1 nmol/L, His tagged)
was mixed with 200 nmol/L f-Bak, 1 nmol/L Tb-labeled anti-His antibody,
and compound at room temperature for 30 min. Fluorescence was
measured on an Envision plate reader (Perkin-Elmer) using a 340/35 nm
excitation filter and 520/525 ( f-Bak) and 495/510 nm (Tb-labeled anti-His
antibody) emission filters. Dissociation constants (K i) were determined
using Wang’s equation (20).
Cell culture and in vitro cytotoxicity assays. Human tumor cell
lines [American Type Culture Collection or Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ)] were maintained at 37jC

containing 5% CO2. SCLC cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen)
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 1% sodium pyruvate,
25 mmol/L HEPES, 4.5 g/L glucose, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(Sigma). Leukemia and lymphoma cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Cells (1  104–5  104) were treated for 48 h in 96-well culture plates in a
final volume of 100 AL and cytotoxicity was assessed with the CellTiter Glo
assay (Promega).
In vivo tumor xenograft studies. All animal studies were conducted
according to guidelines established by the internal Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. C.B.-17 scid-bg or C.B.-17 scid mice (Charles River
Laboratories) were implanted with 5  106 (1  106 for DoHH2) cells in
0.2 mL 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences) s.c. into the right flank. Tumorbearing mice were size matched (f235 mm3; day 0) into treatment and
control groups, ear tagged, and monitored individually. Tumor volume
was measured two to three times weekly by electronic calipers (volume =
length  width2 / 2). Tumor growth inhibition was calculated based on the
difference in mean tumor volumes between treated and appropriate vehicle
control groups. Partial response (PR) is defined as z50% tumor growth
inhibition, and complete response (CR) is defined as nonpalpable tumor. All
studies used 8 to 10 mice per group. Statistical comparisons of tumor
growth rate and tumor growth delay used the Wilcoxon rank sum test and
the Mantle-Cox log-rank test, respectively.
ABT-263 was formulated in 10% ethanol, 30% polyethylene glycol 400,
and 60% Phosal 50 PG and administered p.o. The other agents used
[rituximab (Genentech, Inc.), doxorubicin (Bedford Laboratories), cyclophosphamide (Bristol-Myers Squibb), vincristine (GensiaSicor Pharmaceuticals), bortezomib (Millenium Pharmaceuticals), and prednisone (Aero
Pharmaceuticals)] were administered i.p., p.o., or i.v. and formulated
according to the manufacturers’ recommendations. For combination
studies, ABT-263 was given f2 h before the other agents, except bortezomib, which was given f4 h before ABT-263.
Additional details on materials and methods can be found in Supplementary data.

Results
ABT-263 is an orally bioavailable Bcl-2 family inhibitor. The
structural features in ABT-737 that impart undesirable drug
properties result from design elements essential for inhibition of
a large surface area, hydrophobic protein-protein interaction, and
reduction of serum albumin binding (4–6). To improve the oral
efficacy of this relatively large (MW >800) molecule, a careful
balance was required between target affinity, cellular potency, and
oral absorption. Three key sites along the backbone of ABT-737
were identified that affect charge balance, metabolism, and oral
absorption (Fig. 1). Analogues incorporating modifications at these
positions were optimized to maximize the pharmacokinetic/

pharmacodynamic relationship between oral exposure in animals
and efficacy in human tumor cell lines. These efforts resulted in the
identification of ABT-263.
ABT-263 maintains high affinity for Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bcl-w,
which is below the detection limit of the fluorescence polarization
assay (K i V1 nmol/L), but binds more weakly to Mcl-1 and A1
(Table 1). This selectivity pattern is similar to that of its
predecessor ABT-737 and the BH3-only protein Bad (12). Subnanomolar affinity of ABT-263 for Bcl-xL was confirmed by a more
sensitive time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer
assay that shows the enantiomer (a stereoisomer with the opposite
configuration of the morpholinoethyl group, used as a less active
control) to be f40-fold less potent.
The pharmacokinetic profile of ABT-263 is characterized by low
plasma clearance values and low volumes of distribution in mouse,
rat, dog, and monkey, with plasma elimination half-lives after i.v.
dose of 4.6 to 8.4 hours (Supplementary Table S1). Bioavailability
after oral gavage was f20% in all four species. Due to its low
aqueous solubility, ABT-263 displays a prolonged dissolution ratelimited oral absorption. P.o. administration in lipid-based formulations, in which the compound is significantly more soluble,
yields enhanced absorption with bioavailability near 50% and an
oral elimination half-life of 8.9 hours in dogs. A representative
plasma drug concentration curve after i.v. or p.o. dosing in dog is
shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.
ABT-263 exhibits mechanism-based cytotoxicity. A number of
BH3 mimetic small molecules have been reported to bind Bcl-2
family members with modest affinity and induce apoptosis in tumor
cell lines (21–23). However, many of these agents were recently
shown to kill cells in a Bax/Bak–independent manner, calling into
question the functional relevance of their weak affinity for Bcl-2
proteins and the true mechanisms of action for these molecules
(14). Therefore, we felt it important to robustly demonstrate that
apoptosis induced by ABT-263 was the direct result of inhibition of
Bcl-2 family proteins. First, the cellular activity of ABT-263 was
evaluated in the interleukin-3 (IL-3)–dependent prolymphocytic
FL5.12 murine cell line. Withdrawal of IL-3 induces FL5.12
apoptosis, in part by up-regulation of the proapoptotic factors
Bim and Puma (24, 25). Overexpression of Bcl-2 (FL5.12-Bcl-2) or
Bcl-xL (FL5.12-Bcl-xL) protects against the effects of IL-3 withdrawal by sequestration of Bim and Puma (25). ABT-263, but not the
enantiomer, reversed the protection afforded by overexpression
of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (EC50 = 60 and 20 nmol/L, respectively; Fig. 2A).
ABT-263 was ineffective in eliciting cell death in the presence of
IL-3 where FL5.12 cells were not subject to proapoptotic stimuli.
The ability of ABT-263 to kill FL5.12-Bcl-2 or FL5.12-Bcl-xL cells
under IL-3 withdrawal was significantly attenuated in the presence
of the caspase inhibitor ZVAD, indicating that cell killing is caspase
dependent (Supplementary Fig. S2).
To determine if ABT-263–induced cytotoxicity can be attributed
to the disruption of intracellular Bcl-2 family protein-protein
interactions, coimmunoprecipitation studies were done. ABT-263
induced a dose-dependent decrease in Bim:Bcl-xL interactions
within 2 hours posttreatment in FL5.12-Bcl-xL cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Similar patterns were also observed for the disruption
of Bim:Bcl-2 complexes in FL5.12-Bcl-2 cells (data not shown),
indicating that ABT-263 restores IL-3–dependent cell death by
attenuating the ability of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 to sequester proapoptotic factors such as Bim. The ability of ABT-263 to disrupt Bcl-2
family protein-protein interactions was confirmed in a mammalian
two-hybrid system (Fig. 2B). ABT-263 inhibited the interaction of

To further interrogate the mechanism of action, the activity of
ABT-263 was evaluated in a series of mouse embryonic fibroblast

(MEF) cells that included wild-type (WT) as well as cells deficient

the ability of ABT-263 to functionally inhibit Bcl-xL, but not Mcl-1,
in a cellular context and is consistent with previous observations
with ABT-737 (7, 11, 13, 14, 26). The enantiomer was ineffective in
both systems. ABT-263 was also ineffective (EC50 z10 Amol/L) in
killing either WT or DKO MEF cells, consistent with previous
reports (14). In contrast, etoposide, a general cytotoxic agent, as
well as two reported small-molecule BH3 mimetics [( )-gossypol
and GX15-070], induced cell death with similar EC50s across all four
MEF cell types, suggesting that these compounds induce cell death,
at least in part, by Bcl-2 family–independent mechanisms
(Supplementary Fig. S4C).
To assess the ability of ABT-263 to directly induce apoptosis in a
human tumor cell line, Bax translocation and release of
cytochrome c were monitored in the SCLC cell line H146. H146
has been shown to be dependent on Bcl-2 for survival (25). ABT-263
induced a dose-dependent decrease in cytosolic Bax coupled with
an increase in cytosolic cytochrome c within 2 hours posttreatment
(Fig. 2C-i). The enantiomer was unable to elicit a similar response.
Bax activation and cytochrome c release were confirmed by
microscopy (Fig. 2C-ii ). The 6A7 anti-Bax antibody, which
specifically recognizes the conformationally active form of Bax,
was used to detect activated Bax in H146 cells. Consistent with the
fractionation studies, ABT-263 treatment was associated with a
substantial increase in activated Bax. This corresponded to release
of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol as evidenced
by decreased punctate structures and increased cytosolic staining.
ABT-263, but not its enantiomer, also induced a time-dependent
increase in caspase-3 activity that was detectable at 2 hours and
which peaked at f6 hours (Fig. 2D). This effect was concentration
dependent, with an EC50 f100 nmol/L at the 6-hour time point
(Fig. 2D, inset). In contrast, camptothecin, a topoisomerase I
inhibitor reported to induce mitochondrial apoptosis and subsequent caspase activation (27, 28), was only able to elicit an increase
in caspase-3 activity after 24 hours (data not shown). These data
indicate that ABT-263 acts directly to inhibit Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL,
releasing proapoptotic factors such as Bim to induce a rapid
activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
To evaluate the breadth of cellular activity of ABT-263, a panel of
human tumor cell lines spanning a range of tumor types was
examined. Consistent with previous reports on ABT-737 (12),
ABT-263 exhibited single-agent activity in SCLC and hematologic
malignancies but not in the majority of other tumor types (data
not shown). To more closely investigate the activity within these
sensitive tumor types, ABT-263 was examined in panels of cell lines
derived from SCLC (n = 22) and hematologic malignancies (n = 23).
In each panel, ABT-263 exhibited a range of potency with 32%
(SCLC) and 48% (hematologic) of cell lines being highly sensitive
(EC50 <1 Amol/L; Fig. 3). The enantiomer was >20-fold less active in
these sensitive cells (Supplementary Table S2).
Oral dosing of ABT-263 results in the regression of SCLC
and ALL xenograft tumors in vivo. To extend these observations
in vivo, ABT-263 was evaluated in flank xenograft models
established from some of the sensitive SCLC and hematologic cell
lines. When dosed p.o., once a day at 100 mg/kg for 21 consecutive
days, ABT-263 induced rapid and complete tumor responses (CR)
that were durable for several weeks after the end of treatment in all
animals bearing H889 (SCLC) or RS4;11 (ALL) tumors (Fig. 4A).
Similar treatment of mice bearing H146 SCLC tumors induced rapid
regressions resulting in CR in 60% and PR in 40% of the animals
(Fig. 4A). Gradual tumor rebound was observed beginning several
weeks after the end of dosing in this model. Activity was dose

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

dependent in the H146 xenograft model. Treatment with ABT-263 at
50 mg/kg for 21 consecutive days induced CR in 22% and PR in 44%
of the animals, whereas 25 mg/kg induced a statistically significant
but modest tumor growth inhibition with no observed tumor regressions. ABT-263 was well tolerated (<5% weight loss) at all doses.
To correlate the exposure of ABT-263 with antitumor efficacy,
a steady-state pharmacokinetic study was done in which non–
tumor-bearing mice were dosed p.o. once a day for 3 days, and
plasma drug concentrations determined after the third dose. Both
peak plasma concentration (C max) and area under the plasma
concentration curve (AUC) were proportional to dose and increased
in a roughly linear fashion (Supplementary Table S3). A dose of
100 mg/kg, which produced a 100% overall response rate (overall
response rate = CR + PR), gave C max and AUC values of 7.7 Amol/L
and 90 Amol/L h, respectively. The exposure resulting from a
50 mg/kg dose, which elicited a 66% overall response rate, was
5.4 Amol/L (C max) and 54 Amol/L h (AUC). These data indicate that
peak plasma drug concentrations of ABT-263 ranging from f5.4 to
7.7 Amol/L are highly efficacious.
ABT-263 enhances the activity of chemotherapeutic agents
in vivo. The in vivo efficacy of ABT-263 was investigated in
combination with commonly used therapeutic agents in several
aggressive models of hematologic malignancies. ABT-263 and
rituximab were examined in the DoHH2 B-cell lymphoma flank
xenograft model (Fig. 4B). When dosed daily at 100 mg/kg p.o. for
17 days, ABT-263 exhibited 44% tumor growth inhibition. A single
10 mg/kg dose of rituximab elicited 84% tumor growth inhibition.
Neither ABT-263 nor rituximab alone achieved sustained tumor
regression; however, the combination exhibited a superior effect,
achieving 70% CR and 10% PR. This combination also resulted in a
significant improvement in tumor growth delay (>700%) versus
rituximab alone (300%).
The efficacy of ABT-263 alone and in combination with a
modified R-CHOP regimen was also evaluated in a GRANTA-519
flank xenograft model of mantle cell lymphoma (Fig. 4B). ABT-263
delivered at 100 mg/kg p.o. for 21 consecutive days elicited 40%
tumor growth inhibition. In comparison, the R-CHOP regimen
inhibited tumor growth by 68% with 20% CR. The combination
resulted in dramatic tumor regressions and complete tumor
responses in all animals tested with no evidence of tumor regrowth
in four of nine evaluable tumors.
Finally, we examined the ability of ABT-263 to potentiate the
effects of chemotherapy in a model resistant to ABT-263. In the
OPM-2 flank xenograft model of multiple myeloma (in vitro EC50 =
6.7 Amol/L), ABT-263 delivered daily for 21 days at 100 mg/kg did
not significantly inhibit tumor growth (Fig. 4B). Bortezomib
delivered at its maximum tolerated dose (1 mg/kg i.v., qd 3)
inhibited tumor growth by 70% with no CRs. ABT-263 enhanced the
efficacy of bortezomib with the combination resulting in 95%
tumor growth inhibition and a 40% CR rate.
ABT-263 induces a rapid but reversible thrombocytopenia.
We recently reported that ABT-737 induces a rapid and reversible
thrombocytopenia in animals resulting from inhibition of Bcl-2
family proteins and induction of apoptosis in circulating platelets
without bone marrow toxicity (29). As expected, ABT-263 also
induces thrombocytopenia. After a single p.o. dose in dogs,
circulating platelet counts decreased within 2 hours with a platelet nadir at 6 hours and evidence of rebound within 24 hours
(Fig. 5A). To determine the effects of prolonged dosing, we examined the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship following
multiple daily doses in dog (Fig. 5B). ABT-263 was dosed p.o. at

2 mg/kg/d for 6 days, and then increased to 6 mg/kg/d for an
additional 6 days. Platelet counts and plasma drug concentrations
were evaluated 6 hours posttreatment to capture the likely platelet
nadirs on days 1 to 4 and days 7 to 11. At 2 mg/kg, platelet counts
decreased from an initial value of f250,000/AL to f125,000/AL by
the second dose, thereafter holding steady for the remaining doses.
Plasma drug concentration obtained 6 hours posttreatment (C 6h)
remained constant at values ranging from 3.6 to 4.2 Amol/L. Based
on the pharmacokinetic profile of ABT-263 (Supplementary Fig. S1),
the C 6h is roughly 2-fold lower than the C max, indicating that the
peak plasma drug concentrations achieved after multiple 2 mg/kg
doses are f7 to 8 Amol/L. These levels are similar to those
obtained after a 100 mg/kg p.o. dose in mice. When the dose of
ABT-263 was increased to 6 mg/kg/d, platelet counts decreased to
f50,000/AL by the second day of this higher dose and remained
relatively constant for the duration of the study. The C 6h values at
this dose level ranged from 10.2 to 14.8 Amol/L (C max, 20–30 Amol/L).
ABT-263 was well tolerated in this study with no mortality or adverse clinical signs. However, some hematomas were apparent at
the site of venipuncture, consistent with alterations in hemostasis.
These data indicate that repeated daily exposure of ABT-263 at
levels shown to be highly efficacious in murine models results in
f50% reduction in circulating platelets in dogs. Furthermore, plasma
concentrations severalfold higher than the efficacious level are well
tolerated, with circulating platelet counts reduced to f50,000/AL.

Discussion
Tumor initiation, progression, and maintenance commonly
involve alterations in apoptosis, which lead to enhanced cell

survival and resistance to therapy (30). The prosurvival Bcl-2 family
proteins act by sequestering and neutralizing proapoptotic
proteins and play a pivotal role in determining the ability of a
cancer cell to undergo apoptosis. Consequently, Bcl-2 and its
prosurvival homologues are attractive targets for therapeutic
intervention. ABT-737 was the first small-molecule mimetic of the
proapoptotic BH3 binding domain that exhibits high affinity to
multiple Bcl-2 family members (12). Studies from numerous
laboratories have established the activity of ABT-737 in a variety
of single agent and combination settings (8–10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 25, 31).
However, the physical properties of ABT-737 will likely prohibit its
full potential as a clinical agent. To overcome this, we report here
the development of ABT-263, a second-generation, orally bioavailable small-molecule Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor that is currently
in phase I clinical trials.
Analogous to its predecessor ABT-737, ABT-263 possesses high
affinity for Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bcl-w, but not for Mcl-1 or A1 (Fig. 1).
In contrast to ABT-737, however, ABT-263 is orally bioavailable
in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey. ABT-263 exhibits a low volume
of distribution consistent with high serum protein binding,
resulting in an oral half-life of f9 hours in dog. Furthermore,
ABT-263 dosed p.o. reaches exposures similar to those attained
by ABT-737 when given at the same dose by i.p. injection
(Supplementary Table S3).
In cells, ABT-263 inhibits the interaction between proapoptotic
and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in both a mammalian twohybrid system and in FL5.12 cells. IL-3 withdrawal in FL5.12 cells
has previously been shown to dramatically increase Bim and
reduce Mcl-1 levels, resulting in the induction of apoptosis (24, 32).
Bcl-2 overexpression protects the cells from cytokine withdrawal by

loss of Mcl-1 (25). Disruption of this complex and release of Bim
either to directly activate Bax and/or Bak (direct model) or to
further antagonize antiapoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1 to release

activated Bax and Bak (indirect model) is sufficient to induce cell
death. On the other hand, ABT-263 is ineffective in cells that have
not previously been primed with proapoptotic stimuli (i.e., FL5.12
cells in the presence of IL-3; Fig. 2).

Bcl-2 Family Protein Inhibitor

The induction of apoptosis by the proapoptotic BH3-only
proteins is dependent on Bax or Bak (33, 34). As such, Bax/Bak–
deficient cells are immune to BH3-only protein–mediated cell
death. It was previously shown that the induction of apoptosis by
ABT-737 in MEF cells requires the neutralization of Mcl-1 and is
dependent on Bax and Bak (14). Similarly, we observe that
neutralization of Mcl-1 (i.e., Mcl-1 / MEFs) is required for ABT263 to induce apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S4A). This is
indicative of cell killing mediated through inhibition of Bcl-xL
(and Bcl-2). In contrast, other reported Bcl-2 family inhibitors
exhibit cytotoxicity independent of Bax and Bak (14). Consistent
with these observations, both reported BH3 mimetics tested in this
study [GX15-070 and ( )-gossypol] displayed a similar spectrum of
cell killing in WT and DKO MEF cells to the general cytotoxic agent
etoposide (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
In contrast to nonmalignant cells, cancer cells are continually
bombarded by multiple stress signals that predispose them to
die (1, 25). Cancer cells overcome these death signals through
alterations in the apoptotic pathway (e.g., up-regulation of
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members). Human tumor cell lines
such as H146 that have been shown to be ‘‘addicted’’ to Bcl-2
are, in fact, quite sensitive to treatment with ABT-263, leading to
rapid Bax activation, cytochrome c release, and caspase
activation. In a broader sense, the protection afforded to cancer
cells by Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 is illustrated by the single-agent activity
of ABT-263 in f30% to 50% of SCLC and hematologic malignant
cell lines (Fig. 3).
From gene expression microarray analysis, cells overexpressing
Mcl-1 are resistant to ABT-263, similar to observations made with
ABT-737 (Supplementary Fig. S5). Furthermore, siRNA knockdown
of Mcl-1 in the resistant SCLC cell line H196 restores sensitivity to
ABT-263 (Supplementary Fig. S6). The role of Mcl-1 as a resistance
factor for ABT-263 is also supported by the fact that ABT-263 is
only effective in MEF cells in which Mcl-1 has been deleted
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). This is consistent with recent studies
with ABT-737, showing that attenuation of Mcl-1 in resistant cells
leads to restoration of single-agent activity (7, 11, 13, 14, 26).
Interestingly, ABT-263 does exhibit measurable (550 nmol/L)
affinity for Mcl-1 (Table 1), suggesting that affinity <500 nmol/L
is necessary to functionally inhibit this protein.
In vivo, ABT-263 exhibited pronounced oral activity in multiple
xenograft models, both as a single agent and in combination with
chemotherapy (Fig. 4). ABT-263 treatment of mice bearing
established SCLC and ALL tumors resulted in rapid and complete
tumor regression, suggesting that these tumor types are attractive
areas for clinical investigation. Furthermore, ABT-263 dramatically
enhanced the efficacy of several approved oncology agents in B-cell
malignant xenograft models. Recent reports have described the role
of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in conferring resistance to rituximab
(35–37). In the DoHH2 diffuse large B-cell xenograft, ABT-263
dramatically enhanced rituximab treatment above what was
observed with each agent alone and induced complete regression
of the majority of treated tumors. ABT-263 also significantly
enhanced the activity of R-CHOP in a mantle cell lymphoma
xenograft model, increasing the CR from 20% to 100%, with 44% of
the mice exhibiting apparent cures. These are significant findings
given that rituximab is routinely administered either alone or in
combination with CHOP (i.e., R-CHOP) as first- and second-line
therapy in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients (38). The activity of
bortezomib was also significantly enhanced by ABT-263 in the
OPM-2 multiple myeloma xenograft model, a tumor type that is

www.aacrjournals.org

typically associated with high Mcl-1 expression. Bortezomibinduced cell death is mediated, in part, by the neutralization of
Mcl-1 via up-regulation of Noxa (39–44). Indeed, we observe the
up-regulation of Noxa in OPM-2 cells treated with bortezomib
(Supplementary Fig. S7). This suggests that the pronounced
synergy between bortezomib and ABT-263 may be due to net
neutralization of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 (by ABT-263) and Mcl-1
(by bortezomib). These data show that, in addition to its single
agent activity, ABT-263 can significantly enhance the efficacy of
common chemotherapies to improve tumor regressions and overall
response rates. This is true even in cases such as the OPM-2
multiple myeloma model, where ABT-263 alone displays little
monotherapy activity.
Chronic daily dosing of ABT-263 is well tolerated in murine
xenograft models with minimal weight loss and no overt toxicities.
However, we previously reported that inhibition of prosurvival Bcl-2
family proteins with ABT-737 induces apoptosis in circulating
platelets that results in their hepatic clearance without bone marrow
toxicity (29). Recent reports have also described hypomorphic
mutations in Bcl-x, which lead to thrombocytopenia in mice similar
to that observed with ABT-737 treatment (45). The platelet effects of
ABT-737 are also completely Bak/Bax dependent, indicating that
ABT-737 acts upstream of these important mediators in the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl-xL
directly results in thrombocytopenia. Here we examined the effects
of multiple daily dosing that would more closely mimic the clinical
setting. Because dogs exhibit platelet levels and hemostasis similar
to humans, and Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins are highly conserved
between these species, evaluation of the ABT-263–induced thrombocytopenia was done in the dog (Fig. 5).
Similar to ABT-737, ABT-263 induced a rapid reduction in
circulating platelets in dogs. However, multiple daily dosing that
achieves sustained plasma levels of ABT-263 does not significantly
reduce platelet counts below that observed after the first dose. This
suggests that either there are distinct populations within the
circulating platelet pool that display differential sensitivities to
ABT-263 or the animals are able to rapidly compensate by
producing more platelets to maintain a steady-state platelet count.
Although dose escalation results in a further decrease in platelets,
continued dosing at this level produces a similar steady-state effect.
Importantly, these studies suggest that a therapeutic window exists.
In murine efficacy models, peak plasma concentrations of ABT-263
from 5.4 to 7.7 Amol/L were highly efficacious. Plasma drug
concentrations severalfold above these efficacious levels were
achieved in dogs after repeated daily p.o. dosing without
decreasing circulating platelet count below 50,000/AL, which
would constitute clinical grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Bcl-xL
inhibition by ABT-263 seems to only affect circulating platelets,
which is fundamentally different than thrombocytopenia observed
with most cytotoxic chemotherapies that act through myelosuppression. It is important to point out that the platelet effects
observed with ABT-263 are mechanism based, reversible, easily
monitored, and well tolerated in these studies. In fact, it has been
suggested that monitoring circulating platelet counts may
represent a convenient surrogate marker for Bcl-xL inhibition in
the clinic (45).
In summary, we describe here the properties of ABT-263, an
orally bioavailable Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor that not only
exhibits robust single-agent activity but also significantly enhances
the antitumor activity of common chemotherapeutics. The ability
to orally dose ABT-263 provides the flexibility to dose chronically to

maximize efficacy as a single agent, as well as to develop practical
and effective combination-dosing regimens with parenteral chemotherapeutics. These studies provide a strong rationale for the
clinical development of ABT-263 in both SCLC and hematologic
malignancies.
