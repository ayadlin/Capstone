BACKGROUND. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether tumor-infiltrating immune cells in biopsy specimens can be used to predict the clinical outcome of stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

METHOD. The authors performed an immunohistochemical study to identify and
count the number of CD681 macrophages, c-kit1 mast cells, and CD81 T cells in
both cancer nests and cancer stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens obtained
from 199 patients with stage IV NSCLC treated by chemotherapy, and then analyzed for correlations between the number of immune cells and clinical outcome,
including chemotherapy response and prognosis.

RESULTS. There was no correlation between the number of immune cells in either cancer nests or stroma and chemotherapy response. Patients with more tumor-infiltrating macrophages in cancer nests than in cancer stroma
(macrophages, nests > stroma) had significantly better survival than nests <
stroma cases median survival time (MST 440 days vs 199 days; P < .0001).
Patients with more tumor-infiltrating CD81 T cells in cancer nests than in cancer
stroma (CD81 T cells: nests > stroma) showed significantly better survival than
in nests < stroma cases (MST 388 days vs 256 days; P 5 .0070). The proportion of
tumor-infiltrating macrophages or CD81 T cells between cancer nests and stroma
became independent prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis. Neither the
number of mast cells in nests nor in stroma correlated with the clinical outcome.
CONCLUSIONS. Evaluation of the numbers of macrophages and CD81 T cells in
cancer nests and stroma are useful biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of
stage IV NSCLC patients treated with chemotherapy, but could fail to predict
chemotherapy response. Cancer 2008;113:1387–95.  2008 American Cancer

ung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths throughout the
world, and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for
approximately 80% of lung cancer. The prognosis of NSCLC is poor,
and patients with advanced NSCLC are candidates for systemic
chemotherapy.1 During the 1990s, 5 new drugs became available for
the treatment of metastatic NSCLC: paclitaxel, docetaxel, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and irinotecan. Each of them has since been
evaluated in combination regimens with cisplatin or carboplatin,
and the median survival time of patients with metastatic NSCLC
treated with such regimens is approximately 8 to 10 months.2,3
However, some patients with metastatic NSCLC exhibit long-term

survival, and their tumors progress slowly after
chemotherapy, or even in the absence of treatment.4
Tumor cells are surrounded by infiltrating
inflammatory cells, such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells. Infiltration of
CD81 T cells has been shown to be an important
phenomenon for a specific immune response in several tumor systems, and CD81 T cells have been
reported to play an important suppressive role in cancer progression, including ovarian cancer, esophageal
cancer, pancreatic cancer, bile duct cancer, gallbladder
cancer, and colorectal cancer.5-12 Immunologists have
long considered the presence of tumor-infiltrating
macrophages as evidence of a host response against
the growing tumor, and the presence of tumor-infiltrating macrophages has been reported to be associated
with anticancer immunomechanisms of the tumorbearing host and a favorable prognosis. However,
recently, tumor-associated macrophage infiltration has
been found to be correlated with angiogenesis and an
unfavorable prognosis in several kinds of cancer,
including gastric cancer, endometrial cancer, and
breast cancer.13-15 Furthermore, it has been reported
that mast cells produce many angiogenic factors and a
variety of cytokines, including transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin8 (IL-8), fibroblast growth factor-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor, which are implicated in both normal and tumor-associated neoangiogenesis.16 In fact,
mast cell density has been reported to be highly correlated with the extent of both normal and pathologic
angiogenesis, such as the angiogenesis observed in
chronic inflammatory diseases and tumors, including
gastric cancer and endometrial cancer.17,18
Tumor-infiltrating immune cells are thought to
play important roles in disease progression and therapeutic efficacy. The effect of chemoradiotherapy has
been found to be correlated with the presence of
CD81 T cells in esophageal cancer,11 and cervical
cancer patients with T-cell infiltration showed
improved local response to radiation therapy.19
In the current study, we evaluated the status of
tumor-infiltrating immune cells in tumor biopsy specimens obtained from stage IV NSCLC patient and
analyzed the numbers of immune cells and clinical
outcome, including chemotherapy response and
prognosis, for correlations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Tissue Specimens
The tumor specimens analyzed in this study were
obtained from a total of 199 patients with stage IV
NSCLC who received platinum-based combination

chemotherapy (cisplatin plus paclitaxel, docetaxel,
gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or irinotecan, or carboplatin plus paclitaxel), which is considered to be the
standard regimen20,21 at the National Cancer Center
Hospital East in Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan, between January 1996 and December 2004, with performance
status (PS) 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale. Of the 199 patients, 184 had died
by the time of the analysis. All patients had adequate
tumor biopsy specimens obtainable before chemotherapy and were analyzed in this study. The tumor
specimens were obtained by bronchoscopy in 152
patients, and by percutaneous needle biopsy in 47
patients. The histological classification was based on
a World Health Organization report. Clinical staging
was based on an initial evaluation consisting of a
clinical assessment, chest radiography, computed tomography of the chest and abdomen, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the
brain, and bone scintigraphy. The current International Staging System was used to stage clinical disease.22 All target lesions were evaluated for response
by computed tomography or magnetic resonance
imaging after completion of the first-line chemotherapy, and all patients underwent tumor biopsy and
chemotherapy, after obtaining informed consent in
accordance with institutional guidelines.

Immunohistochemistry and Cell Counts
All specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin embedded. Four-micrometer-thick sections were
mounted on silanized slides and deparaffinized with
xylene and ethanol. To retrieve the antigen for macrophages, sections were pretreated in 0.05% trypsin
and incubated for 20 minutes at 378C in a humidity
chamber. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with
0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 minutes. We used
mouse antihuman CD68 antibody (Dako, Kyoto,
Japan) to detect macrophages, mouse antihuman
CD8 antibody (Novocastra, Newcastle, UK) to detect
T cells, and mouse antihuman c-kit antibody (Dako)
to detect mast cells; immunostaining was performed
with Envision (Dako). To retrieve the antigen for CD8
and c-kit, sections were immersed in 10 mM citric
buffer solution (pH 6.0) and heated to 958C by exposure to microwave irradiation for 20 minutes.
We performed an immunohistochemical study to
identify and count the number of CD681 macrophages, c-kit1 mast cells, and CD81 T cells and confirmed that cancer cells and mesenchymal cells such
as endothelial cells were not immunostained with
these antibodies.
Immunostained cells counts were blinded to the
patients’ clinical data. Macrophages, CD81 T cells,

Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells in NSCLC

and mast cells in the specimen were counted in 2
locations: in the ‘‘cancer nests’’ and in the ‘‘cancer
stroma.’’ Cancer nests were defined as ‘‘cancer nests
without fibroblasts and vasculatures’’ and cancer
stroma as ‘‘connective tissues surrounding cancer
nests without any cancer cells.’’ Every biopsy specimen had both cancer nest and stroma, and it was
possible to distinguish these lesions. We counted
CD681 round cells as macrophages, c-kit1 round
cells as mast cells, and CD81 round cells as T cells.
By using a high-power microscopic field (3400;
0.0625 mm2), we separately counted the number of
macrophages, CD81 T cells, and mast cells in each 2
most intensive areas. Two pathologists (O.K. and G.I)
reviewed all slides and counted the cells.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the Scientific
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, Chicago, Ill) software. We used median values to calculate category
correlations between macrophages, CD81 T cells,
mast cells, and survival rate by the Kaplan-Meier
method, and performed univariate analyses by
means of log-rank test. The chi-square test was used
to test for relationships between categorical variables. Multivariate analysis was performed by means
of the Cox proportional hazards model. Student t test
was used to test for correlation between macrophage
counts, CD81 T cell counts, mast cell counts and
response to first-line chemotherapy. We evaluated
test results as significant if the P value was P < .05.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The clinicopathological characteristics of all patients
are listed in Table 1. Their median age at the time of
diagnosis was 62 years (range, 39 years-79 years), and
139 of the 199 patients were men. There were 134
patients with adenocarcinoma, 41 patients with squamous cell carcinoma, and 24 patients with NSCLC
that could not be specified by biopsy specimen.

were also observed in cancer stroma (Fig. 2B) in 195
of the 199 tumors, and the mean number was

Relationships between the number of infiltrating
macrophages, mast cells, CD81 T cells, and
clinicopathological variables
The numbers of infiltrating macrophages, mast cells,
and CD81 T cells were divided into 2 groups at the
median value. The relationships between these
groups in cancer nests or stroma and the individual
clinicopathological characteristics (sex, age, smoking
history, PS, histological type) were examined by the
chi-square test. More macrophages were present in
cancer nests in the nonadenocarcinomas than in the
adenocarcinomas (data not shown).

Correlations between the numbers of tumor-infiltrating
macrophages, mast cells, and CD81 T cells
and patient survival
Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and the log-rank test
were performed to compare survival with the number
of infiltrating cells (Fig. 2, Table 3). Patients with more
macrophages in cancer nests than the median value

had the same survival rate as patients with fewer macrophages. By contrast, patients with more macrophages in the cancer stroma had significantly poorer
survival than those with fewer macrophages
(P 5 .0001). The median survival time was 243 days in
the group with higher numbers of macrophages in the
stroma, versus 391 days in the group with fewer macrophages in the stroma (1-year survival rate, 33.9% and
55.2%, respectively). Patients were divided into 2
groups, according to the distribution of infiltrating
macrophages; a High Nests Macrophage (HNM) group,
in which the number of macrophages in the cancer
nests was higher than in the cancer stroma (macro-

significantly better survival than the LNM group (P <

the HNM group versus only 199 days in the LNM
group, and the 1-year survival rate was 60.8% and
21.4%, respectively. Although mast cells in the cancer
nests have been reported to contribute to a favorable
outcome,23 there was no significant relationship with
patient survival in this study (Fig. 2D-F). Figure 2G-I
shows the relation between the number of CD81 T
cells and patient survival; there was a positive association between survival and the number of CD81 T

cells in cancer nests (Fig. 2G, P 5 .0008). Median survival was 388 days in the group with the higher number of CD81 T cells in the cancer nests, versus 242
days in the group with the lower number (1-year survival rate, 52.8% and 34.3%, respectively). According
to the distribution of infiltrating CD81 T cells,
patients in the High Nests CD81 T cell (HNT) group,
in which the number of tumor-infiltrating CD81 T
cells was higher in the cancer nests than in the cancer
stroma (nests > stroma), had significantly better survival than those in the Low Nests CD81 T cell (LNT)

only 199 days in the LNT group, and 1-year survival
rate was 53.4% and 31.3%, respectively.
We then classified the patients into 4 groups
according to macrophage and CD81 T cell distribution: 1) the HNM and HNT group (macrophages, nests
> stroma; CD81 T cells, nests > stroma), 2) the HNM
and LNT group (macrophages, nests > stroma; CD81

(macrophages, nests < stroma; CD81 T cells, nests >

Median survival time was 495 days in the HNM and

group, and the 1-year survival rate was 68.4% and
12.5%, respectively. Median survival time was 342
days, and 1-year survival rate was 45.0% in the HNM
and LNT group; median survival time was 221 days,
and the 1-year survival rate was 27.2% in the LNM and
HNT group. Patients in the HNM and HNT group had
significantly better survival than patients in the other
groups (Fig. 3, Table 3)

Multivariate Regression Analysis of Survival in
NSCLC Patients
As immune cells in cancer nests and cancer stroma
would have different biological activity in regard to tumor progression, it would be meaningful to evaluate
immune cell distribution. Considering that the distributions of macrophages in cancer nests and cancer
stroma may impact clinical outcome, multivariate
analysis of macrophage and CD81 T cell distribution
and clinicopathological predictors of survival was performed by means of the Cox proportional hazards
model (Table 4), and both macrophage distribution (P
< .001) and CD81 T cell distribution (P 5 .040)
emerged as independent favorable prognostic indicators. Smoking status also emerged as an independent
prognostic indicator (P 5 .033).

DISCUSSION
This is the first study to investigate the relationship
between the number of tumor-infiltrating macrophages, mast cells, and CD81 T cells in tumor biopsy
specimens and the clinical outcome of patients with
stage IV NSCLC. Patients with higher numbers of tumor-infiltrating macrophages and CD81 T cells in
cancer nests than in cancer stroma had significantly
better survival. These factors were also independent
prognostic factors in multivariate analysis.
Immunologists have long considered the presence
of tumor-infiltrating immune cells as evidence of a
host response against the growing tumor. However,
recently reports have shown that macrophages and
mast cells in cancer stroma secrete several growth factors and proteases involved in angiogenesis, thereby
promoting cancer progression. An experimental study
has demonstrated that interaction between lung cancer cells and macrophages promotes the invasiveness
and matrix-degrading activity of cancer cells,24 and
infiltration by these cells has been reported to be

associated with an unfavorable outcome in several
kinds of cancers.25-27 Conversely, macrophages in cancer nests produce cytotoxic cytokines, such as IL-1a,
IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a, which may protect against tumor progression.28 Considering the results of this
study showing that the distributions of macrophages
in cancer nests and cancer stroma impacted outcome
of stage IV NSCLC, the macrophages in cancer nests
and cancer stroma may have different biological activity in regard to tumor progression. Welsh et al demonstrated that higher numbers of macrophages in
cancer stroma and lower numbers of macrophages in
cancer nests were unfavorable prognosis factors in
surgically resected NSCLC,23 and their findings are in
part consistent with the results of our study. No relationship between the numbers of macrophages in
cancer nests and patient survival was found in our

study. This can be explained by the difference
between the specimens from operable cases of NSCLC
(stage I-III) and stage IV cases.
CD81 T cells with cytotoxic activity play an important role in antitumor immunity. CD81 T cells
can circumvent many of the barriers inherent in cancer-induced stroma, while optimizing T-cell specificity, activation, homing, and antitumor function.29
The presence of tumor-infiltrating CD81 T cells has
previously been reported to be associated with a
favorable outcome, the same as in our own study.5-12,30
Patients in the HNM and HNT group had significantly better survival (median survival was 495 days;
1-year survival rate was 68.5%) than patients in the
HNM group (median survival, 440 days; 1-year survival rate, 60.8%; Fig. 2C) and patients in the HNT
group (median survival, 388 days; 1-year survival
rate, 53.4%; Fig. 2I). There were also many long-term
survivors in the HNM and HNT group, which notably
had a 3-year survival rate of 19.1%. Because aggregation of tumor-infiltrating macrophages in cancer
nests has been reported to have a beneficial effect by
activating cytotoxic T cells,31 the macrophages and
CD81 T cells in cancer nests should exert synergistic
antitumor effects. Infiltration of CD81 T cells in gastric carcinoma is actually directly correlated with
macrophage infiltration, suggesting that macrophages play an important part in the activation of T
cells and subsequent tumor cell destruction.31
Whether there is any correlation between the
presence of tumor-infiltrating mast cells and cancer
progression is a matter of controversy. In previous
studies, mast cells were found to have antitumor

1394

functions, including serving as natural cytotoxic
effectors32,33 and antitumor compounds,34 and to be
a favorable prognostic factor in surgically resected
NSCLC, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer.35-37
Although mast cells produce histamine, basic fibroblast growth factor, heparin, chymase, and tryptase,
which have been shown to promote cancer progression, including in surgically resected NSCLC, gastric
cancer, and endometrial cancer,18,38 no significant
relation to survival was found in this study.
Accumulation of immune cells in tumor tissue
either before or during chemoimmunotherapy has
been reported to be associated with a better clinical
response and improved survival.39-41 The effect of
chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer is correlated with the number of CD81 T cells in the tumor
of each patient, and the patterns of gene expressions
for T cell activation and for tumor vessel formation
may become good markers for identifying potential
long-term survivors.11 However, in the present study,
no correlations between numbers of macrophages,
CD81 T cells, or mast cells and response to first-line
chemotherapy were found (Table 2). The results of
our study suggested that patients with a favorable or
unfavorable prognosis could be identified by the status of tumor-infiltrating macrophages and CD81 T
cells in tumor biopsy specimens before receiving
chemotherapy regardless of chemotherapy response.
Cancer patients can mount cellular immune
responses against their own tumor cells, and hosts
can respond to a large compendium of tumor-associated antigens and epitopes. The natural immune
system within the cancer microenvironment may
affect its ability to control malignant disease beyond
the response to chemotherapy. The only treatment
currently available for metastatic NSCLC is chemotherapy, but patients with a poor prognosis, and
patients with a predominant distribution of macrophages and CD81 T cells in the cancer stroma,
require some additional therapy to prolong life. For
example, elimination of macrophages from the cancer stroma or transfer of CD81 T cells to cancer nests
might be beneficial in prolonging the life of stage IV
NSCLC patients in these unfavorable groups.
In conclusion, we found that predominant distribution of macrophages and/or CD81 T cells in cancer nests as opposed to cancer stroma was correlated
with a favorable prognosis in stage IV NSCLC
patients. Patients with advanced NSCLC require
additional therapy, because the response rate to
chemotherapy has been poor (only 30%-40%), and
the median survival time of patients with metastatic
NSCLC is approximately 8 months to 10 months.20,21
The results of our study indicate the possibility of

using macrophages and CD81 T cells to treat
advanced NSCLC in the future.42 Decreasing the
number of tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor stroma in an animal model of breast cancer
effectively altered the tumor microenvironment
involved in tumor angiogenesis and progression and
markedly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis.43
Thus, a more accurate insight into the role of
macrophages and CD81 T cells in tumors and consideration of the local microenvironment in regulating the functions of these cells is needed and has
important implications for the design of future clinical trials of adjuvant therapy, as well as for our
understanding of the immunopathobiology of stage
IV NSCLC.
