Abstract
Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the human
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Although approved
for use in EGFR-overexpressing advanced colorectal cancer,
recent studies have shown a lack of association between EGFR
overexpression and cetuximab response, requiring the identification of novel biomarkers predictive of response to this
agent. To do so, 22 colon cancer cell lines were screened for
cetuximab response in vitro and sensitive and resistant lines
were identified. In sensitive cell lines, cetuximab induced a
G0-G1 arrest without inducing apoptosis. Notably, cetuximabsensitive but not cetuximab-resistant cell lines were preferentially responsive to EGF-stimulated growth. Whereas neither
EGFR protein/mRNA expression nor gene copy number
correlated with cetuximab response, examination of the
mutation status of signaling components downstream of
EGFR showed that cell lines with activating PIK3CA
mutations or loss of PTEN expression (PTEN null) were more
resistant to cetuximab than PIK3CA wild type (WT)/PTENexpressing cell lines (14 F 5.0% versus 38.5 F 6.4% growth
inhibition, mean F SE; P = 0.008). Consistently, PIK3CA
mutant isogenic HCT116 cells showed increased resistance to
cetuximab compared with PIK3CA WT controls. Furthermore,
cell lines that were PIK3CA mutant/PTEN null and Ras/BRAF
mutant were highly resistant to cetuximab compared with
those without dual mutations/PTEN loss (10.8 F 4.3% versus
38.8 F 5.9% growth inhibition, respectively; P = 0.002),
indicating that constitutive and simultaneous activation of
the Ras and PIK3CA pathways confers maximal resistance to
this agent. A priori screening of colon tumors for PTEN
expression status and PIK3CA and Ras/BRAF mutation status
could help stratify patients likely to benefit from this therapy.

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway
is commonly activated in colorectal cancer and has been explored
for several years as a target for cancer therapy (1). EGFR is

expressed in 30% to 85% of colorectal cancer patients, and the
intensity of its expression has been linked to reduced survival (2, 3).
Dysregulation of EGFR signaling has been shown to stimulate cell
proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastatic spread and to inhibit
apoptosis (1, 4). Activation of this pathway occurs after ligand
[EGF, transforming growth factor (TGF), amphiregulin] binding
to EGFR, which leads to EGFR phosphorylation and oligodimerization at the plasma membrane. This in turn triggers a chain of
downstream signaling events that include activation of the Ras/
Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt, and signal transducer and activator of
transcription pathways (4, 5). Cetuximab is a chimeric IgG1
monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of
EGFR, blocking ligand binding to the receptor (1). Based on a
randomized phase II clinical trial, cetuximab was approved in the
United States in 2004 for use in combination with irinotecan or as
monotherapy in EGFR-positive irinotecan-refractory colorectal
cancer (6).
Cetuximab, however, has an objective response rate of only 9%
when used as a single agent, along with toxicities of diarrhea, skin
rash, and infusion reactions (7). There is therefore a clear need for
biomarkers predictive of response to cetuximab to maximize
likelihood of response while minimizing toxicities and cost.
Whereas cetuximab was initially approved for treatment of
patients with EGFR overexpression, the utility of EGFR as a
predictive biomarker for cetuximab response has become increasingly controversial (6, 8, 9). One limitation of these studies is that
EGFR expression status was frequently measured in the primary
tumor, whereas objective response is measured in metastatic
lesions. Recent studies have shown variability in EGFR expression
between primary and metastatic tumors from the same patient
(10, 11), suggesting the need to determine EGFR expression status
at the stage and site at which response is determined. The first
objective of this study, therefore, was to directly compare EGFR
expression and cetuximab response in the same colon cancer cell
lines.
In addition to EGFR expression, a further determinant of
cetuximab sensitivity may be the presence or absence of mutations
that result in constitutive activation of EGFR-mediated signaling.
For example, in lung cancer, patients with activating mutations in
the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (encoded by exons 18–21) show
significantly greater response to the small molecule inhibitors of
EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, gefitinib and erlotinib (12–14).
Whereas mutations in the EGFR kinase domain are extremely rare
in colon cancer (15), mutations which constitutively activate key
signaling mediators downstream of EGFR, particularly K-Ras/BRAF
and PTEN/PIK3CA, are more common (16–19). We hypothesized

therefore that colon tumors with constitutively activated downstream signaling mediators of the EGFR pathway would be
refractory to inhibition of the pathway at the receptor level.
Indeed, several recent studies have shown a link between K-Ras
mutation status and cetuximab response, with tumors wild type
(WT) for K-Ras showing improved response to this agent (20–22).
However, other studies failed to do so (23).
In the present study, we observed that separation of cell lines
according to PIK3CA mutation/PTEN expression status significantly distinguished cetuximab sensitive and resistant cell lines.
Particularly, cell lines with both PIK3CA mutation/PTEN loss and
Ras/BRAF mutation were highly resistant to cetuximab. Therefore,
a priori screening of colon tumors for PIK3CA mutation/PTEN
expression and Ras/BRAF mutation status may help identify
patients likely to benefit from this therapy.

Materials and Methods
Determination of sensitivity of colon cancer cell lines to cetuximab
and EGF. The sources and maintenance of the colon cancer cell lines used
in this study have been previously described (24), with the exception of
the GEO cell line which was kindly provided by Dr. Z Fan (M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center).
For determination of cetuximab sensitivity, 5,000 to 50,000 cells per well
(24) were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 20,
50, and 100 Ag/mL cetuximab for 72 h. For each cell line, one plate was
harvested for determination of t = 0 absorbance values. Viable cells were
determined 72 h posttreatment using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay by measurement of absorbance
at 570 nm. The relative rate of cell growth for each cell line was factored
into the analysis by subtracting the absorbance at time 0 from both the
control and treatment groups. All the experiments were replicated thrice at
a minimum.
For determination of sensitivity to EGF, cells were serum starved for
4 h and then treated with 0, 0.5, or 5 ng/mL EGF for 24 to 72 h. For
cetuximab/EGF cotreatment experiments, cells were pretreated with
cetuximab for 4 h before EGF addition.
HCT116 K-Ras and PIK3CA isogenic cell lines. HCT116 colon cancer
cells harbor both activating K-Ras and PIK3CA mutations. Isogenic HCT116
K-Ras and PIK3CA WT and mutant cells were generously provided by the
Sasuzaki and Vogelstein/Velculescu Laboratories, respectively (25, 26).
Cell cycle distribution—fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis.
For assessment of the effect of cetuximab and EGF on cell cycle distribution, cells were stained with 50 Ag/mL propidium iodide overnight and
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was performed, as
previously described (27).
Determination of cetuximab response in vivo. For xenograft experiments, 5  106 GEO or LIM2405 cells in 200 AL of PBS/Matrigel (1:1)
were injected s.c. into the right flank of SCID mice. Tumors were allowed to
form for f1 wk. Animals were then injected with either PBS or cetuximab
(10 mg/kg or f300 Ag per mouse) i.p. biweekly for 2 wk, as previously
described (28). Upon sacrifice, tumor volume was calculated from
measurements of the smallest (s) and longest (l) diameter based on the
following formula: volume = [(s 2  l)  p] / 6.
Determination of EGFR protein and mRNA expression in colon
cancer cell lines. EGFR protein expression was determined by Western
blot using an anti-EGFR antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). EGFR mRNA
expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. EGFR-specific
primers were as follows: (F, ATGCTCTACAACCCCACCAC; R,
GCCCTTCGCACTTCTTACAC). Results were expressed relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (primers: F, TCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGG; R, GAATTTGCCATGGGTGGAAT).
Determination of EGFR gene copy number by fluorescence in situ
hybridization. EGFR copy number was assessed in colcemid-treated cells
by standard cytogenetic methods using 0.075 mol/L KCl and Carnoy’s
fixative (methanol/acetic acid, 3:1). Metaphase chromosomes were

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (6). March 15, 2008

hybridized overnight with the dual color LSI EGFR/CEP7 (Vysis locus–
specific identifier DNA) probe and counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino2-phenylindole. This probe has a specific EGFR Spectrum Orange probe
and a CEP7 probe, labeled in spectrum green, which hybridizes to the a
satellite DNA located at the centromere of chromosome 7 (7p11.1-q11.1).
Images were acquired with an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51)
connected to a Sensicam QE CCD cooled camera. Ten metaphases for each
cell line were analyzed using the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
view software (Spectral Imaging). EGFR gene amplification was defined as
more than one copy of EGFR locus per chromosome 7, and EGFR polysomy
was defined as more than two EGFR loci per nucleus.
Identification of K-Ras, BRAF, PIK3CA, and PTEN mutations in
colon cancer cell lines. The mutation status of K-Ras, BRAF (exon 15),
PIK3CA (exons 9 and 20), and PTEN for a subset of the cell lines was
obtained from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Cancer Genome Project
Web site4 or from previous publications. For cell lines for which the
mutation status of one or more of these genes was unknown, genomic DNA
was isolated using the Qiagen DNA extraction kit. Primers used for
amplification of exon 2 of K-Ras were F, AGGCCTGCTGAAAATGACTGAATA and R, CTGTATCAAAGAATGGTCCTGCAC. Primers used were F,
AACACATTTCAAGCCCCAAA and R, GAAACTGGTTTCAAAATATTCGTT
for amplification of exon 15 of BRAF; F, GCTTTTTCTGTAAATCATCTGTG
and R, CTGAGATCAGCCAAATTCAGT for exon 9 of PIK3CA; and F,
CATTTGCTCCAAACTGACCA and R, TACTCCAAAGCCTCTTGCTC ( for
codon 1023 mutation) and F, ACATTCGAAAGACCCTAGCC and R,
CAATTCCTATGCAATCGGTCT ( for codon 1047 mutation) for exon 20 of
PIK3CA. PTEN expression status was determined by Western blot using an
anti-PTEN antibody (Cell Signaling).
Statistical analyses. Differences between two groups were analyzed
using an unpaired Student’s t test with P < 0.05 considered statistically
significant. Differences in cetuximab sensitivity between cell lines WT or
mutant for specific genes or gene combinations were determined using an
unpaired Student’s t test with Bonferroni adjustment. Because we
performed five separate analyses, P < 0.01 was considered statistically
significant. For correlative analyses, a Pearson’s correlation coefficient was
computed with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant.

Results
Determination of sensitivity of colon cancer cell lines to
cetuximab. To identify colon cancer cell lines with differential
response to cetuximab, a panel of 22 colon cancer cell lines was
screened for cetuximab response using the MTT assay. As shown in
Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1, a spectrum of sensitivity to
cetuximab was identified. Maximal response was observed in the
LIM1215, GEO, and SW403 cell lines, where growth was inhibited
>70% at the maximum concentration of cetuximab tested. An
intermediate response (f50% growth inhibition) was observed in
the Caco-2 and SW948 cell lines, whereas minimal response (<35%
growth inhibition) was observed in the remaining cell lines (Fig. 1
and Supplementary Fig. S1).
Differential sensitivity of colon cancer cell lines to cetuximab in vitro is also observed in vivo. To confirm the differential
sensitivity of colon cancer cell lines to cetuximab in vivo, the
sensitive GEO and resistant LIM2405 cell lines were grown as
xenografts in SCID mice and treated with 10 mg/kg cetuximab
biweekly for 2 weeks. Consistent with the in vitro findings, cetuximab inhibited growth of GEO cells by f75% (205 F 36 mm3
compared with 854 F 201 mm3 in cetuximab-treated and control
mice, respectively), whereas no growth inhibitory effect was
observed in LIM2405 cells (999 F 32 mm3 versus 934 F 66 mm3
in cetuximab-treated and control mice, respectively; Fig. 1B).

Prediction of Response to Cetuximab

22 cell lines screened for cetuximab response. Points, mean (n = 3–5 experiments); bars, SE. B, differential sensitivity of colon cancer cells to cetuximab in vivo .
5  106 cells of the cetuximab-sensitive (GEO) and cetuximab-resistant (LIM2405) colon cancer cell lines were injected in SCID mice. Once palpable tumors had
formed, animals were injected with cetuximab (10 mg/kg) or PBS (control), biweekly, for 2 wk, after which animals were sacrificed, tumors were excised, and tumor
volume was calculated, as in Materials and Methods.

Comparable sensitivity profiles of colon cancer cells to
cetuximab and erlotinb. To confirm that the sensitivity spectrum
of colon cancer cells to cetuximab reflected inhibition of EGFR and
its downstream signaling pathway, we assessed the response of
12 of the cell lines to erlotinib (5 Ag/mL), a small molecule tyrosine
kinase inhibitor that targets the intracellular domain of EGFR.
As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, a significant correlation
between response of colon cancer cell lines to cetuximab and
erlotinib was observed, consistent with both agents mediating
growth inhibition through inhibition of EGFR signaling (r 2 = 0.542,
P = 0.006). In contrast, no significant correlation was observed
between cetuximab response and response to the mechanistically
distinct chemotherapeutic agent, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; r 2 = 0.019,
P = 0.678; Supplementary Fig. S2).
Cetuximab induces a G0-G1 arrest in colon cancer cells. To
confirm the findings of the MTT assay and to further assess the
effect of cetuximab on cell cycle distribution, we determined the
effect of cetuximab on cell cycle distribution in the three most
sensitive and three most resistant cell lines (Fig. 2A–C). Consistent
with the MTT data, an increase in the percentage of cells in G0-G1
and a concomitant decrease in the percentage of cells in S phase
were observed in the three sensitive cell lines (LIM1215, GEO, and
SW403). No difference in the percentage of cells in G2-M was
observed. In comparison, minimal change in cell cycle distribution
was observed in the resistant cell lines (LIM2405, HCT116, and
HCT15). Importantly, minimal effects on apoptosis were observed

in this cell line panel, either at 24 or 72 hours after cetuximab
treatment (Fig. 2D), indicating cetuximab elicits a predominantly
cytostatic effect in colon cancer cells. In contrast, treatment of
SW403 cells with 5 Amol/L 5-FU induced f50% apoptosis after
72 hours of treatment, demonstrating that these cell lines are not
inherently resistant to apoptosis (Fig. 2D).
EGFR mRNA, protein expression, or gene copy number do
not correlate with cetuximab response in colon cancer cell
lines. Because cetuximab targets EGFR, we determined whether
basal EGFR mRNA and/or protein expression in the cell line panel
correlated with cetuximab response. EGFR mRNA in the 22–cell
line panel was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription–PCR
(Q-RT-PCR). As shown in Fig. 3A, no correlation between basal
EGFR mRNA expression and cetuximab response was observed
(R 2 = 0.067, P = 0.244). To determine whether basal EGFR protein
expression correlated with cetuximab response, EGFR protein
expression was assessed in the 22 cell lines. Whereas significant
correlation between EGFR mRNA and protein expression was
observed (R 2 = 0.35, P = 0.003), no correlation between basal
EGFR protein expression and cetuximab response was observed
(R = 0.36, R 2 = 0.13, P = 0.099; Fig. 3B).
Finally, studies by Moroni et al. suggested that EGFR gene
amplification status correlates with response to cetuximab in
patients with colon cancer (23). Hence, the EGFR amplification
status of the three most sensitive and three most resistant colon
cancer cell lines was determined by FISH analysis. As shown in

Fig. 3C, no EGFR gene amplification was seen in any of the six
colon cancer cell lines tested. Two sensitive (GEO and SW403)
and one resistant cell line (LIM2405) contained three copies of
EGFR per nucleus; however, in each case, three copies of the
chromosome 7 marker CEP7 were also observed indicating this
reflected polysomy as opposed to amplification of the EGFR
locus. Collectively, therefore, no correlation between cetuximab
response and EGFR expression of copy number was observed in
the colon cancer cell line panel.
Cetuximab sensitivity correlates with growth response to
EGF. Signaling via the EGFR receptor is initiated upon ligand
binding (EGF, TGF-a, amphiregulin), with signal transduction
primarily through the PTEN/PI3K/AKT and/or Ras/Raf/MAP/
MEK/ERK pathways. We speculated, therefore, that cell lines
responsive to ligand mediated canonical activation of this pathway
for their growth would be most sensitive to cetuximab.
To test this, the proliferative response of the three most
cetuximab-sensitive and three most cetuximab-resistant cell lines
to exogenous EGF treatment was examined under serum-free
conditions (Fig. 4). A significant increase in S phase was observed
24 hours post–EGF treatment (0.5 ng/mL) in the three cetuximabsensitive cell lines (GEO, LIM1215, and SW403) but not in the three
most cetuximab-resistant cell lines (LIM2405, HCT15, and HCT116;
Fig. 4A). To confirm this result, we also performed MTT assays.
Treatment with 0.5 or 5 ng/mL EGF preferentially increased growth
of the cetuximab-sensitive cell lines, establishing a clear link
between response to the mitogenic effects of EGF and the growth
inhibitory effects of cetuximab (Fig. 4B). Similar results were
observed when response to a 10-fold higher concentration of EGF
(5 ng/mL) was tested (Supplementary Fig. S3). Importantly,

pretreatment of the EGF-responsive cell lines with cetuximab
significantly attenuated the mitogenic effect of EGF (Fig. 4B).
Mutation status of PIK3CA and/or PTEN predicts response
to cetuximab. Ligand binding to EGFR results in signal
transduction via the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK and the PI3K/AKT
pathway. As mutations that result in constitutive activation of
each of these pathways occur at high frequencies in colon cancer,
we hypothesized that colon cancer cell lines with constitutively
activated signaling downstream of EGFR would not be dependent
on ligand binding to EGFR for their growth and, in turn, would be
refractory to cetuximab.
Mutation-driven constitutive activation of the PI3K signaling
pathway has been reported to occur in f30% of colon tumors,
primarily due to activating mutations in exons 9 and 20 of the
PIK3CA gene (18) and, to a lesser extent, due to inactivating PTEN
mutations or PTEN promoter methylation (29). The presence of
activating PIK3CA mutations in the cell line panel was assessed by
literature searches from the COSMIC database and by direct
sequencing of exons 9 and 20 of the PIK3CA gene. Mutations in
PIK3CA were identified in 8 of the 22 cell lines (Table 1;
Supplementary Fig. S5). Separation of cell lines according to
PIK3CA mutation status alone did not distinguish cetuximab
sensitive from resistant cell lines (16.3 F 6.0% versus 33.7 F 6.4%
growth inhibition for PIK3CA mutant versus WT cell lines,
respectively; P = 0.08).
PTEN is a tumor suppressor that acts as a negative regulator
of PI3K signaling by converting PIP3 to PIP2, and truncating
mutations which result in loss of PTEN expression have been
reported in f20% of MSI colon cancers (30, 31). We noted that the
KM12 cell line that was PIK3CA WT, yet highly resistant to

distribution, cells were treated for 24 h
with 20 Ag/mL cetuximab (A–C ). For
assessment of apoptosis, cells were
treated with 20 Ag/mL cetuximab or

analysis. Points, mean; bars, SE (n = 3;

Prediction of Response to Cetuximab

cetuximab, harbors a truncating mutation in PTEN (Wellcome
Trust Sanger Institute Cancer Genome Project5). The PTEN
expression status of the cell line panel was therefore determined
by Western blot (Supplementary Fig. S4). In addition to KM12,
loss of PTEN expression was also observed in the cetuximab
resistant LIM2405 line (Supplementary Fig. S4). Consistent with
previous reports, both lines with loss of PTEN expression were
derived from MSI colon cancers. Furthermore, the occurrence of
PIK3CA mutations and loss of PTEN expression in the cell line
was mutually exclusive, as previously reported (32).
Separation of cell lines according to PIK3CA mutation and/or
PTEN expression status identified a significant difference in
cetuximab sensitivity, with PIK3CA mutant/PTEN null cell lines
being significantly more refractory to cetuximab treatment (14.0 F
5.0% versus 38.5 F 6.4% growth inhibition for PIK3CA mutant/
PTEN null versus PIK3CA WT/PTEN-expressing cell lines, respectively; P = 0.008; Fig. 5A).
To further confirm this finding, we examined cetuximab
response in a pair of isogenic HCT116 cells provided by the
Velculescu/Vogelstein Laboratories, in which either the mutant or
WT PIK3CA allele has been deleted by homologous recombination
(26). Whereas the PIK3CA mutant HCT116 isogenic cell line was
highly resistant to cetuximab, a modest, although statistically
significant, response to cetuximab was observed in the PIK3CA WT
isogenic line (Fig. 5B). Collectively, these findings show that colon
cancer cell lines with constitutively active PI3K signaling are
refractory to cetuximab.

Mutation status of K-Ras or BRAF does not predict response
to cetuximab. Several clinical studies have examined the
relationship between Ras mutation status of colon tumors and
response to cetuximab. Whereas an initial study did not observe an
association (23), more recent studies have shown that colon tumors
mutant for K-Ras are less responsive to cetuximab compared with
WT tumors (20–22).
To validate and extend these findings, the K-Ras mutation status
of the cell line panel was determined by literature searches,
searching of the Sanger database or direct sequencing of codons
12 and 13 in exon 2 of the K-Ras gene (Table 1; Supplementary
Fig. S5). Of the 22 cell lines in the panel, 13 were mutant and 9
were WT for K-Ras. Separation of the cell lines according to Ras
mutation status did not result in a differential response to
cetuximab (22.2 F 6.6% versus 34.7 F 6.8% growth inhibition for
Ras mutant versus WT cell lines, respectively; P = 0.21). The lack of
an association between Ras mutation status and resistance to
cetuximab was underscored by the observation that the established
cetuximab-sensitive cell line GEO (28) and SW403 harbored a
mutant K-Ras allele (Fig. 1). To further confirm this finding, we
compared cetuximab response in parental HCT116 cells (Ras
mutant) and the HCT116 Ras WT isogenic derivative (Hke3)
generated by targeted deletion of the mutant K-Ras allele. No
difference in cetuximab response, as assessed by cell number
24 hours post–cetuximab treatment, was observed between the Ras
mutant and WT clones (Fig. 5C).
Mutations in BRAF are frequently observed in colon tumors WT
for K-Ras. The BRAF mutation status of the cell line panel was
therefore determined by direct sequencing of exon 15. Three cell
lines harboring BRAF mutations were identified in the cell line
panel (RKO, HT29, and LIM2405). Consistent with the previously

Discussion

observed mutual exclusion of Ras and BRAF mutations in colon
tumors, the three cell lines with BRAF mutations were WT for
K-Ras. Separation of the cell lines according to Ras/BRAF mutation
status resulted in a tendency for Ras/BRAF WT cell lines to be
more sensitive to cetuximab compared with Ras/BRAF mutant
lines, although this effect was not statistically significant (22.6 F
5.4% versus 40.0 F 9.4% growth inhibition for Ras/BRAF mutant
versus WT cell lines, respectively; P = 0.11; Fig. 5A).
Collective consideration of PIK3CA/PTEN and RAS/BRAF
mutation status further predicts cetuximab response. Notably,
our mutation screening analysis showed that, whereas 9 of 16 cell
lines (56%) with Ras/BRAF mutations harbored a synchronous
PIK3CA/PTEN mutation, 9 of the 10 cell lines (90%) harboring
PIK3CA/PTEN mutations contained synchronous Ras/BRAF mutations (Table 1). This finding is consistent with previous reports
indicating significant overlap between the presence of PIK3CA and
K-Ras/BRAF mutations within the same colorectal tumor (19, 33).
Importantly, separation of cell lines that were both PIK3CA mutant/
PTEN null and Ras/BRAF mutant, versus those that were not,
further discriminated between cetuximab-sensitive and cetuximabresistant cell lines, with PIK3CA mutant/PTEN null;Ras/BRAF
mutant lines (10.8 F 4.3% growth inhibition) being significantly
more resistant to cetuximab than cell lines that did not harbor
mutations in both of these pathways (38.8 F 5.9% growth
inhibition, P = 0.002; Fig. 5A).

The development and approval of novel therapies, including the
monoclonal antibodies bevacizumab (anti-vascular endothelial
growth factor; Avastin) and cetuximab (anti-EGFR), have increased
median survival of patients with metastatic colon cancer to
f24 months (34, 35).
Cetuximab was initially approved for use in colorectal cancer
patients with EGFR overexpression; however, recent retrospective
clinical reports found no evidence for limiting cetuximab therapy
to patients with EGFR-overexpressing tumors (8, 9). Similarly, our
present findings failed to show an association between EGFR
expression and cetuximab response in colon cancer cell lines,
indicating that factors other than EGFR expression are primarily
responsible for determining response to this agent.
In addition to EGFR expression, a link between EGFR amplification and response to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody–based
treatment has been shown (23). For example, the Difi colon cancer
cell line, which has high-level EGFR amplification, is highly sensitive
to cetuximab, undergoing both growth arrest and apoptosis at
cetuximab concentrations several orders of magnitude lower than
those required for response in other cell lines (6, 36). Lievre et al.
also described a complete response in a patient with high-level
EGFR amplification (20 copies per nucleus; ref. 22). EGFR
amplification, however, is a rare event in colon cancer, occurring
at a frequency of <1% of cases (37–39). Consistent with this finding,

Prediction of Response to Cetuximab

Figure 4. EGF selectively stimulates cell growth in cetuximab-sensitive cell lines. A, effect of EGF treatment on cell cycle progression. Cells were treated for 24 h

representative experiment; #, P < 0.05. Experiments were repeated three separate times.

examination of EGFR amplification status in cetuximab-sensitive
and cetuximab-resistant cell lines in the present study failed to
identify any lines with EGFR amplification. These findings shows
that, whereas rare tumors and cell lines with EGFR amplification are
highly sensitive to cetuximab, more modest, cytostatic responses to
this agent are obtained in the absence of EGFR amplification.
Two of the cell lines identified as cetuximab-sensitive, LIM1215
and SW403, have previously been shown to be dependent upon
activation of EGFR in an autocrine manner for their growth
(40, 41). A previous study also showed a link between the
proliferative response of colon adenocarcinoma cell lines to EGF
and response to EGFR inhibition (42). We confirmed and extended
these observations by demonstrating that cetuximab-sensitive cell
lines were more sensitive to EGF-induced growth promotion than
cetuximab-resistant lines. Importantly, the growth stimulatory
effect of EGF could be completely inhibited by pretreatment with
cetuximab. These findings indicate that a subset of colon tumors
that are dependent upon ligand activation of EGFR for their growth
exists, and it is these cell lines that are growth inhibited by
blockade of ligand binding to the EGFR.
As recently shown, tumor cells can lose their dependence on
growth factors via mutation-driven constitutive activation of
signaling pathways downstream of growth factor receptors,

www.aacrjournals.org

specifically the PI3K and Ras/MAPK pathways (43). We observed
that stratification of cell lines according to PIK3CA/PTEN
expression mutation status identified a significant difference in
cetuximab response, with PIK3CA mutant/PTEN null lines being
consistently more resistant to this agent compared with WT lines.
This finding was further confirmed using the HCT116 PIK3CA
WT and mutant isogenic cell lines, where increased sensitivity to
cetuximab was observed in the PIK3CA WT line. This finding is
consistent with the reported observation that HCT116 PIK3CA WT
cells are more dependent on serum-derived growth factors for their
growth and are more responsive to EGF ligand–induced signaling
compared with the mutant line (26). Collectively, these findings
imply that colon cancer cell lines which acquire mutations that
result in constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway have a
diminished dependence on canonical EGFR ligand–induced signaling for their growth and are, therefore, more resistant to EGFRtargeted therapies.
Two prior studies failed to observe a link between PIK3CA
mutation status and cetuximab response in patients with colon
cancer (22, 23). However, in both of these studies, PTEN mutation
status of the tumors was not examined, and very few patients with
PIK3CA mutations, 3 of 31 (23) and 2 of 30 (22), were identified.
Notably, whereas the low PIK3CA mutation frequency may have

Figure 5. Mutation status and response to cetuximab in vitro. A, cetuximab response in the 22–colon cancer cell line panel separated according to PIK3CA
mutation/PTEN expression status (*, P = 0.008), Ras/BRAF mutation status (P = 0.11), or according to presence or absence of synchronous mutations in the PIK3CA/
PTEN and the K-Ras/BRAF pathways (*, P = 0.002). B, cetuximab response in isogenic PIK3CA mutant and WT HCT116 cell lines. Cells were serum starved overnight,
then treated with 20 or 100 Ag/mL cetuximab for 24 h in medium containing 0.5% serum. Differential sensitivity was assessed by direct counting of cell number.
C, cetuximab response in isogenic Ras mutant and WT HCT116 cells. Cetuximab response was determined 24 h posttreatment by counting cell number.

precluded the overall ability of these studies to detect differences
in cetuximab response between PIK3CA WT and mutant tumors,
four of the five patients with PIK3CA mutations did not respond
to cetuximab. Furthermore, the single patient with a PIK3CA
mutation that did respond had a tumor with low-level EGFR
amplification. Collectively considered therefore, the current data
available in patient samples are relatively consistent with the
present findings, although the need for validation in a larger
patient study clearly remains.
Consistent with the present findings, Frattini et al. recently
reported that colon tumors with loss of PTEN expression have
significantly reduced response to cetuximab (44). Likewise, breast
cancers with either activating mutations in PIK3CA or with loss of
PTEN expression respond poorly to treatment with the Her2/Neu
targeting antibody, trastuzumab (45). Collectively, these studies
provide additional clinical evidence that the mutation status of the
PI3K signaling pathway should be considered before treatment
with EGFR family antagonists.
Several (20–22, 46), although not all, studies (23) that have
examined the link between Ras mutation status and cetuximab
response have shown that patients with tumors WT for both K-Ras
and BRAF have improved response to cetuximab. It is notable,
however, that, in some of these studies, patients with mutant Ras
tumors, who showed clinical response to cetuximab treatment,
were identified (20). In the present study, separation of cell lines
according to Ras and/or BRAF mutation status did not stratify cell
lines according to cetuximab response, although a clear tendency
for Ras/BRAF mutant lines to be more resistant to cetuximab was
observed (P = 0.11). We also observed that two Ras mutant cell lines,
GEO and SW403, showed significant response to cetuximab.
Whereas it remains to be clarified whether determination of
Ras/BRAF mutation status alone is sufficient to stratify patients
for cetuximab treatment (20), we observed that the six most
cetuximab-resistant cell lines harbored mutations or loss of

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (6). March 15, 2008

expression in both the PIK3CA/PTEN and Ras/BRAF pathways.
This finding is consistent with previous reports indicating the
coexistence of Ras and PIK3CA mutations within the same tumor
(19, 33). Importantly, collective consideration of PIK3CA mutation/
PTEN expression and Ras/BRAF mutation status provided the most
robust determinant of cetuximab response, with cell lines
harboring mutations (or loss of PTEN expression) in both of these
pathways being highly resistant to cetuximab. In terms of
therapeutic implications, these findings suggest that patients
whose tumors harbor simultaneous PIK3CA mutations/PTEN loss
and Ras/BRAF mutations are unlikely to benefit from cetuximab
treatment. Instead, these patients may be suitable candidates for
treatment with newer targeted drugs currently in clinical trial,
which inhibit signaling mediators further downstream, including
PI3K, AKT, or mTOR inhibitors and Ras, Raf, or MEK inhibitors.
Importantly, although cell lines with PIK3CA mutation/PTEN loss
and Ras/BRAF mutation were consistently resistant to cetuximab,
not all cell lines WT at the four loci tested, were sensitive to
cetuximab. A possible mechanism of resistance to cetuximab of
these cell lines may be the existence of alternate mutations in the
Ras/BRAF and or PIK3CA/PTEN pathway other than those screened
for in the present analysis. For example, with regards to the PI3K
pathway, less frequently occurring mutations have been described
in exons 1 and 2 of PIK3CA which encode the p85 interacting domain
(18). Mutations in p85a (47), PDK1, AKT2, PAK4, and INSRR (19),
as well as amplifications in AKT2 and IRS2 (19), have also been
described in colon tumors, as have less frequently occurring
mutations in codon 146 (A146T) of the K-Ras gene (48). In this
regard, it is notable that mutations in both codon 146 of K-Ras and in
p85a have been reported in the relatively resistant HCC2998 cell line
(48, 49), which is WT at the four hotspot loci examined in the present
analysis. Comprehensive screening of all known components of the
PI3K and Ras signaling pathways may therefore be required to
further improve prediction of cetuximab response.

Prediction of Response to Cetuximab

In addition to inhibition of EGFR signaling, cetuximab can
stimulate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
and complement dependent cytotoxicity in vivo (50), which may
contribute to its antitumor activity. As our current in vitro model
does not assess the role of ADCC, additional validation of these
findings in patient samples is clearly required.
In conclusion, this study shows that cell lines responsive to
canonical EGFR signaling-mediated growth are also responsive to
cetuximab. We observed that cell lines mutant for PIK3CA/PTEN
null are significantly more resistant to cetuximab compared with
PIK3CA/PTEN WT lines. Furthermore, cell lines with both
constitutively active PIK3CA and Ras/BRAF signaling were highly
