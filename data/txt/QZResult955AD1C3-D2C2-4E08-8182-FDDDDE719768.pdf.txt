Abstract
Genotoxic stress induced by anticancer drugs can lead to
apoptosis of both angiogenic endothelial cells (ECs) and
proliferating tumor cells. However, growth factors such as
basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial
cell growth factor (VEGF) present within the tumor microenvironment can promote chemoresistance by suppressing
apoptotic mechanisms in these cells. Here, we have identified
apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a proapoptotic
member of the MAP3K family, as a target of bFGF-mediated
survival signaling in ECs. Evidence is provided that ASK1 is
required for EC apoptosis in response to the genotoxic
chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, and that bFGF, but not
VEGF, neutralizes the death-promoting activity of ASK1.
Specifically, bFGF stimulation promotes the formation of a
Raf-1/ASK1 complex at the mitochondria, inhibits ASK1
kinase activity, and protects ECs from genotoxic stress.
Mutation of the Raf-1 activation domain (SS338/9AA) not
only prevents Raf-1/ASK1 complex formation but abolishes
bFGF-mediated EC protection from genotoxic stress. In line
with these observations, bFGF, but not VEGF, neutralizes the
antiangiogenic effects of doxorubicin in vivo. These findings
reveal a new pathway of EC survival signaling and define a
molecular mechanism for chemoresistance induced by bFGF.

Introduction
Anticancer treatments have relied in part on ionizing radiation
or systemic administration of genotoxic chemotherapeutics
designed to promote stress-mediated apoptosis of tumor cells as
well as tumor-associated endothelium in response to DNA damage
(1). In fact, proliferating vascular cells within the tumor
microenvironment are likely to be the first targets of chemotherapeutic agents (2). Although growth factors present within the
tumor can provide an epigenetic mechanism by which tumor cells
as well as the genetically stable endothelium may acquire
chemoresistance, little is known about specific mediators of
apoptosis that are targeted by growth factor-induced survival
signals.
Previous studies suggest that cell death in response to genotoxic
stress is associated with the activation of apoptosis signal-

regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) a serine/threonine kinase member of
the MAP3K family (3, 4). ASK1 is a key mediator of a redoxsensitive signaling pathway leading to the initiation of cellular
apoptosis. It is activated in response to a variety of apoptotic
stimuli, including chemotherapeutic agents (3, 5), serum withdrawal (6), oxidative (4, 7), and endoplasmic reticulum stress (8, 9),
as well as treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and Fas
(10, 11). Mice with targeted disruption of ASK1 are phenotypically
normal; however, retinal ganglion cells and embryonic fibroblasts
have been shown to be partially resistant to cell death induced
by ischemic injury (12), hydrogen peroxide, or TNF-a (13). ASK1
is present in both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions
(14) and activates the MKK6/MKK7–c-jun-NH2-kinase and MKK3/
MKK6-p38 kinase pathways (11), leading to mitochondrial cytochrome c release and activation of the caspase-9–dependent or
intrinsic pathway of apoptosis (15). Mice with targeted disruption
of ASK1 are phenotypically normal; however, retinal ganglion cells
and embryonic fibroblasts have been shown to be partially
resistant to cell death induced by ischemic injury (12), hydrogen
peroxide, or TNF-a (13). These observations suggest an important
role for ASK1 in mediating cell death that proceeds via the intrinsic
or mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.
In quiescent cells, ASK1 kinase activity is tightly regulated.
Association of ASK1 with reduced thioredoxin (7) and other
proteins such as glutaredoxin (16), 14-3-3 (17), and SOCS1 (18) has
been shown to regulate its activity. Recent reports have shown that
proapoptotic ASK1 activity is also regulated by Raf-1. Specifically,
when experimentally overexpressed in cells, Raf-1 was shown to
bind to the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of ASK1,
suppressing its death-promoting activity (19, 20). In this respect, we
have previously shown that differential activation of Raf-1 by basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or vascular endothelial cell growth
factor (VEGF) acted to promote endothelial cell (EC) protection
from distinct apoptotic stimuli (21, 22). bFGF promoted translocation of Raf-1 to the mitochondria and preferentially protected
ECs from the intrinsic or stress-mediated apoptosis. In contrast,
VEGF protected cells against apoptosis induced by death ligands
but had little protective effect on stress-mediated death. These
findings provide a molecular basis to explain how distinct angiogenic growth factors activate common pathways of cell proliferation and invasion leading to angiogenesis, yet promote survival
in response to distinct apoptotic stimuli. To further delineate the
molecular basis underlying the chemoprotective function of growth
factors, we examined the role of bFGF or VEGF stimulation of
ECs in regulation of proapoptotic activity of ASK1 by Raf-1. Evidence is provided that ASK1 is required for stress-mediated
apoptosis in ECs and that bFGF, but not VEGF, stimulation
promotes formation of a complex between Raf-1 and ASK1 at the

mitochondria, suppresses ASK1 activity, and provides chemoresistance to ECs. These findings suggest that the chemoprotective
function of bFGF is linked to inhibition of proapoptotic ASK1
activity in ECs.

Materials and Methods
Electroporation and RNAi-mediated knockdown. Human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were electroporated using an Amaxa
Nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany). For RNAi-mediated
knockdown, 5  105 cells in 100 AL EBM-2 (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD)
were electroporated with 2 Amol/L (200 pmol) control or ASK1 small
interfering RNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) using setting
U-001. Cells were immediately transferred to 400 AL RPMI 1640 and
incubated for 15 min at 37jC. Following incubation, cells were added to
complete MCDB131 medium (described below), and the medium was
changed after 2 h. For ASK1 and Raf-1 mutants, 6 Ag of each expression
construct was electroporated into 2  106 cells, and analysis was done after
48 h. We routinely obtain >70% expression efficiency using these conditions.
Reagents, antibodies, and constructs. ASK1 siRNA and antibodies for
immunoprecipitation (H-300) and blotting (F-9) of ASK1, Raf-1 (sc-133)
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phospho-ERK1/2 antibody was from
Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Etoposide, doxorubicin, anti–
h-actin and anti–FLAG-M2 antibodies were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO). Anti-HA antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake
Placid, NY). Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal sc-133 antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and immunoblotted with a monoclonal
antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Growth factor stimulations were
done using indicated concentrations of human recombinant VEGF
(Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) and bFGF (National Cancer Institute).
Cell culture and fractionation. Passage 4-6 human umbilical vein
ECs were maintained in complete MCDB131 medium containing 20%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), endothelial cell growth supplement (Upstate),
5 units/mL Heparin (Sigma), 2 mmol/L glutamine and penicillin/
streptomycin/fungizone (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cellular fractionation
was done using the Pierce Mitochondria Isolation System (Pierce, Rockford,
IL) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in lysis
buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH, 7.5), 20 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 2 mmol/L sodium PPi, 2 mmol/L
EDTA, 2 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 50 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol and complete protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) for 20 min and cleared by centrifugation
for 15 min. Protein concentrations were determined by Pierce BCA
(bicinchoninic acid) Protein Assay. For immunoprecipitations, 1 mg HUVEC
lysates was incubated with 2 Ag primary antibody overnight followed by
2 h incubation with 20 AL protein A/G bead slurry (Pierce). Immunoprecipitates were washed thrice with lysis buffer before immunoblotting or
kinase assays. Whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated
using SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% nonfat dry
milk in TBST, and exposed to the described primary antibodies. Antibody
binding was detected using horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, Arlington
Heights, IL).
In vitro kinase assay. Following immunoprecipitation, beads were
washed once in kinase buffer containing 20 mmol/L HEPES (pH, 7.6),
20 mmol/L MgCl2, 20 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 100 Amol/L sodium
orthovanadate, 2 mmol/L DTT, and 20 Amol/L ATP. A total of 30 AL of
kinase buffer containing 0.5 Ag GST-MKK6 (Upstate) and 10 ACi [g-32P]ATP at 3,000 Ci/mmol (Perkin-Elmer, Shelton, CT) was added to the
beads and incubated for 20 min at 30jC. The kinase reaction was
terminated by the addition of the Laemmli buffer, and proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane.
Phosphorylated MKK6 was detected by storage phosphor autoradiography
and scanning using a STORM 860 Phosphoimager (Molecular Dynamics,
Piscataway, NJ). Quantitation of radiolabeled protein was done using
ImageJ software.

Analysis of cell death. Cell death was scored by analyzing binding of
FITC-conjugated annexin V to externalized membrane phosphatidylserine
(BD PharMingen, Palo Alto, CA) or by detection of active caspases
using carboxyfluorescein-labeled fluoromethyl ketone peptide inhibitor of
caspase, FAM-VAD-FMK (CaspaTag; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) by flow
cytometry according to manufacturer’s instructions. A total of 10,000 cells
were analyzed for each condition. Plasma membrane integrity was analyzed
by staining with 5 Ag/mL propidium iodide.
Mouse Matrigel angiogenesis assay. Adult 6- to 8-week-old C57Bl/6J
(The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) mice were used in this study. The
Matrigel angiogenesis assay is approved by the University of California, San
Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and is done according
to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were
injected with 400 AL of ice-cold growth factor–depleted Matrigel (Becton
Dickinson, Bedford, MA) mixed with 400 ng/mL of each growth factor and
indicated amounts of doxorubicin. After 5 days, mice were i.v. injected with
50 Ag of fluorescein-conjugated endothelium-specific GSL I–isolectin B4
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in 100 AL of PBS. Thirty minutes
after injection, mice were euthanized, the Matrigel plug was surgically
resected and washed in ice-cold PBS. Matrigel plugs were homogenized and
the extent of EC staining by FITC was quantitated by spectrophotometric
analysis.
Statistical analysis. Each experiment was repeated 2 to 4 times. Values
represent means F SE from separate experiments. P values were
determined using Student’s t test assuming populations with equal variance
and two-tailed distribution.

Results
Role of ASK1 in EC apoptosis. Genotoxic chemotherapeutic
agents such as doxorubicin and etoposide activate the stress or
intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by inhibiting topoisomerase II
leading to DNA damage. Cell death mediated by these agents has
been linked to the activation of the proapoptotic kinase ASK1
leading to mitochondrial cytochrome c release and activation of
caspases (3, 5). To determine whether endogenous ASK1 in ECs
is required for stress-mediated death, we knocked down ASK1
expression by RNAi and monitored cell death in response to
the DNA-damaging agent etoposide. Treatment of ECs with
etoposide led to the induction of EC apoptosis, and knockdown
of ASK1 resulted in a significant reduction in this death response
(Fig. 1A). These findings suggest that endogenous ASK1 is required
for apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress. To assess whether
ASK1 expression was sufficient to induce death, ECs were
transduced with adenovirus encoding wild-type (WT) HA-ASK1,
and these cells were monitored for apoptosis. Exogenously
expressed ASK1 produced a dose-dependent apoptotic response,
suggesting that its expression in ECs was sufficient to induce
apoptosis of these cells (Fig. 1B). To establish a role for ASK1 kinase
activity in stress-mediated apoptosis in ECs, we examined the
ability of WT or kinase-inactive ASK1 (K709M) to induce cell death.
Expression of WT ASK1 induced apoptosis, whereas expression
of kinase-inactive ASK1 did not (Fig. 1C). These findings show
that ASK1 kinase activity is sufficient to induce EC apoptosis, and
that it seems required to induce death in response to genotoxic
stress.
bFGF selectively inhibits ASK1 kinase activity and protects
ECs from ASK1-induced apoptosis. bFGF and VEGF act as
survival factors for ECs and can produce chemoresistance to
genotoxic drugs. To assess whether bFGF or VEGF promote EC
survival based on their ability to regulate ASK1, ECs were
transduced with adenovirus encoding HA-tagged WT ASK1 and
then exposed to varying concentrations of bFGF or VEGF.
Although both growth factors produced a maximal level of

extracellular signal-regulated kinase stimulation (data not shown),
exposure of cells to bFGF, but not VEGF, led to the protection
of ECs from ASK1-induced cell death (Fig. 2A), demonstrating
that the survival pathway induced by bFGF protects cells from
ASK1-mediated death, whereas that induced by VEGF does not.

However, in other experiments, VEGF was able to protect ECs
from death induced by activators of caspase-8 (21). Next, we asked
whether bFGF-mediated protection from ASK1-induced EC death
occurs through inhibition of ASK1 kinase activity. We treated
ECs overnight with doxorubicin and assessed the effect of bFGF

Regulation of Genotoxic Apoptosis in ECs by ASK1

or VEGF stimulation on ASK1 kinase activity as measured by
phosphorylation of its substrate MKK6 in an in vitro kinase assay.
Treatment of ECs with doxorubicin led to the activation of
ASK1, and bFGF efficiently inhibited this activity to below baseline
levels, whereas VEGF had no effect on this activity (Fig. 2B).
Selective inhibition of ASK1 by bFGF, but not VEGF, was associated
with bFGF-mediated protection against apoptosis induced by
treatment with doxorubicin (Fig. 2C). These results show that
genotoxic drugs such as doxorubicin induce ASK1 activity leading
to EC death, and that bFGF preferentially suppresses ASK1 activity
and the associated death response.
bFGF, but not VEGF, promotes Raf-1 interaction with ASK1.
Previous studies have shown that the binding of Raf-1 to the
NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of ASK1 suppresses
ASK1-induced cell death (19, 20). Although both bFGF and VEGF
activate Raf-1, they do so via distinct mechanisms (21). We
therefore considered whether the inhibition of ASK1 kinase
activity selectively by bFGF in ECs is linked to the ability of
bFGF-stimulated Raf-1 to form a complex with ASK1. To test this,
lysates from ECs stimulated with bFGF or VEGF were subjected
to immunoprecipitation of endogenous ASK1 followed by immunoblotting for Raf-1. Stimulation of cells with bFGF led to
the formation of a Raf-1/ASK1 complex (Fig. 3A). Importantly,
whereas VEGF leads to Raf-1 activation in ECs as detected by
analysis of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
levels (Fig. 3A), it did not induce the formation of a Raf-1/ASK1
complex (Fig. 3A). To substantiate these findings, lysates from
ECs expressing HA-tagged ASK1 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody followed by blotting for
Raf-1. Once again, bFGF induced a complex between Raf-1 and
ASK1, whereas VEGF did not. We obtained similar results by
performing a reciprocal immunoprecipitation with anti–Raf-1
antibody and blotting with anti-HA (Fig. 3B). These findings
reveal that Raf-1 activation due to bFGF, but not VEGF, induces
the formation of a Raf-1/ASK1 complex in ECs and may account
for selective protection of ECs from stress-mediated death by
bFGF.
Previous studies have shown that bFGF, but not VEGF,
stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of Raf-1 SS338/9 (4).
Interestingly, these sites were found to be required for bFGFmediated protection of ECs against stress-mediated apoptosis.
We therefore determined whether the mutation of SS338/9 of
Raf-1 to alanines might impact bFGF-induced formation of the
Raf-1/ASK1 complex, a process associated with the protection of
cells from stress. To test this, HUVECs electroporated with
expression constructs encoding FLAG-tagged WT, SS338/9AA, or
SS497/9AA Raf-1 (a protein kinase C regulatory site mutant)
were transduced with adenovirus encoding HA-tagged WT ASK1.
Cells were starved overnight and stimulated with bFGF, and
Raf-1 variants were detected in anti-HA immune complexes resolved by SDS-PAGE. Mutation of SS338/9 to alanines significantly
reduced bFGF-induced Raf-1 ASK1 complex formation, whereas
WT and SS497/9AA Raf-1 showed bFGF-dependent formation
of a Raf-1/ASK1 complex (Fig. 3C). Importantly, the SS338/9AA
Raf-1 mutant reduced basal levels of Raf-1/ASK1 complex in
starved ECs, suggesting that this mutant of Raf-1 not only prevents
growth factor–induced Raf-1/ASK1 complex formation but may
actually dissociate this complex in quiescent cells. These results
provide a molecular basis to explain the requirement of SS338/9
sites of Raf-1 in protection against stress-mediated apoptosis
(21, 23).

Figure 3. bFGF selectively promotes the association of Raf-1 with ASK1.
A, ECs were grown in 1% serum overnight followed by 30 min stimulation with
bFGF or VEGF (50 ng/mL). Endogenous ASK1 was immunoprecipitated (IP )
followed by immunoblotting (IB ) for Raf-1. Cellular stimulation with bFGF or
VEGF was confirmed by examining the level of activated ERK1/2 using an
anti–phospho-ERK1/2 antibody. B, ECs were transduced with adenoviral
HA-tagged WT ASK1, incubated in 1% serum overnight followed by 30 min
stimulation with each growth factor (50 ng/mL). Formation of Raf-1/ASK1
complex was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti–Raf-1 antibody and
immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (top ). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation of
cell lysates with anti-HA antibody and blotting with anti–Raf-1 antibody was done
(bottom ). C, expression constructs encoding FLAG-tagged WT, SS338/9AA,
or SS497/9AA Raf-1 were introduced into HUVECs by electroporation. Fourteen
hours later, cells were transduced with 20 MOI Ad HA-ASK1 followed by
overnight incubation in 1% serum. Cells were stimulated with 50 ng/mL bFGF
for indicated time periods followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody,
followed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. Expression of Raf-1
contructs in cell lysates was confirmed using an anti-FLAG antibody.

Subcellular localization of the Raf-1/ASK1 complex. bFGF
promotes translocation of Raf-1 to mitochondria leading to
protection against stress-mediated apoptosis that is independent
of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/ERK kinase/ERK signaling
(21). Interestingly, p21-activated protein kinase (PAK)–mediated
activation of Raf-1 and phosphorylation of SS338/9 sites have
been shown to potentiate mitochondrial translocation of Raf-1
and provide protection from stress (21, 23–25). Because ASK1 is
associated with both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments (14), we determined whether bFGF-induced translocation
of Raf-1 to the mitochondria facilitates association of Raf-1 with
the mitochondrial pool of ASK1. Untreated or doxorubicin-treated

cells were stimulated by bFGF and subjected to subcellular
fractionation. Endogenous ASK1 immune complexes from the
cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions were resolved by SDSPAGE and probed by immunoblotting for endogenous Raf-1 to
detect Raf-1/ASK1 complexes. bFGF stimulation of ECs led to
significant increase in levels of Raf-1/ASK1 complex at the
mitochondria with no significant change in the level of this
complex in the fraction containing the cytoplasm and plasma
membrane (CT + PM in Fig. 4). Furthermore, the activation state
of ASK1 did not impact the basal capacity of ASK1 to form a
complex with Raf-1. These results suggest that bFGF-mediated
translocation of Raf-1 to the mitochondria promotes the formation
of a mitochondrial Raf-1/ASK1 complex leading to the protection
of ECs from genotoxic stress. We observed minimal plasma
membrane contamination in our mitochondrial preparations.
However, this is unlikely to account for enrichment of Raf-1 with
immunoprecipitated ASK1 because we did not observe an
enrichment of the Raf-1/ASK1 complex in the fraction containing
the cytoplasm and plasma membrane.
Stimulation with bFGF, but not VEGF, enhances chemoresistance of angiogenic ECs. In addition to stimulating
proliferation and migration of ECs, bFGF and VEGF promote
angiogenesis in part by acting as EC survival factors that protect
against distinct apoptotic stimuli. Previous studies have suggested
that these growth factors differentially influence the survival of ECs
(21, 26). In this study, we have provided evidence suggesting an
important role for bFGF, but not VEGF, in protection of ECs against
cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. To substantiate our results
in vivo, we determined whether bFGF and VEGF differentially
impact the chemosensitivity of invasive angiogenic ECs in a mouse
model of angiogenesis. Mice were injected with growth factordepleted Matrigel containing increasing concentrations of the
genotoxic stress-inducing drug doxorubicin in the presence or
absence of each growth factor at a concentration to provide
maximal angiogenic stimulation (21). Although bFGF and VEGF
efficiently induced angiogenesis in the absence of doxorubicin, EC
cell survival and angiogenesis was only observed in animals treated
with bFGF. Increasing concentrations of doxorubicin selectively
inhibited VEGF-mediated angiogenesis (Fig. 5). These findings

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

suggest that bFGF, but not VEGF, protects angiogenic ECs against
the genotoxic effects of doxorubicin.

Discussion
In this study, we provide evidence that bFGF selectively inhibits
the proapoptotic activity of ASK1 in ECs and, in so doing, blocks
apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress or exogenous expression
of ASK1. Stimulation of ECs with bFGF, but not VEGF, promotes
the formation of a complex between Raf-1 and ASK1 localized at
the mitochondria, a critical site involved in the regulation of the
intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The significance of these studies is
underscored by the observation that ASK1 not only is sufficient to
induce apoptosis, but is required for the induction of EC apoptosis
in response to genotoxic stress. Thus, our studies summarized in
Fig. 6 identify ASK1 as a target of antiapoptotic signaling by bFGF
and provide evidence for an important role of Raf-1 activation in
this response.

Regulation of Genotoxic Apoptosis in ECs by ASK1

Figure 6. A model depicting the role of
Raf-1 in regulation of ASK1-mediated
apoptosis. bFGF-mediated activation of
Raf-1 promotes a complex between Raf-1
and ASK1 at the mitochondria, leading to
inhibition of ASK1 kinase activity and
prevention of stress-mediated apoptosis.

Accumulating evidence suggests that a critical function of Raf-1
is to protect cells from apoptosis. Targeted disruption of Raf-1 in
mice leads to increased levels of cell death and is associated with
elevated basal ASK1 kinase activity (27–29). Importantly, the
apoptotic phenotypes observed in cardiac-specific Raf-1 knockout animals are rescued when ASK1 expression is also disrupted
(29). These findings provide significant genetic evidence that the
prosurvival function of Raf-1 is linked to its ability to block ASK1mediated apoptosis. In support of these observations, exogenously
expressed Raf-1 was shown to interact with and inhibit ASK1 in
a manner that was not dependent on Raf-1 or MEK kinase
activities (19). The NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of
ASK1 was shown to be required for the formation of this complex
and subsequent inhibition of ASK1-induced apoptosis. To our
knowledge, this is the first report of a physiologic stimulus
leading to formation of an endogenous Raf-1/ASK1 complex
leading to cell survival.
We have previously shown that Raf-1 plays an important role in
EC survival and angiogenesis (21, 22, 30). Raf-1 was shown to be a
point of convergence for growth factor–mediated survival signals
where differential phosphorylation of the activation loop of
Raf-1 mediated divergent protection mechanisms. Specifically,
VEGF activated Raf-1 via Src kinase leading to phosphorylation
of YY340/1 and preferential protection against the extrinsic or
death receptor–mediated apoptosis in a manner that was
dependent on ERK signaling. In contrast, bFGF activated Raf-1
via PAK and promoted the phosphorylation of SS338/9, promoted
Raf-1 translocation to the mitochondria, and protected against
stress-mediated or intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in a manner that
did not require MEK1/2 activation (21, 23). These findings are
consistent with previous observations showing that mitochondriatargeted Raf-1 protects cells against the stress- or caspase-9–
dependent pathway of apoptosis (24, 25, 31). Given the subcellular
localization of ASK1 in both the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic
compartments, as well as the role of Raf-1 in regulation of ASK1mediated apoptosis, we considered whether growth factor–
mediated survival signaling depends on the regulation of
mitochondrial ASK1 by Raf-1 through the formation of an
inhibitory complex. In this report, we provide evidence that bFGF
promotes the formation of an endogenous Raf-1/ASK1 complex at
the mitochondria, inhibits ASK1 kinase activity, and prevents the

www.aacrjournals.org

activation of the downstream proapoptotic cascade. Therefore,
inhibition of mitochondrial ASK1 may play an important role in
bFGF-mediated protection of ECs against stress-mediated apoptosis. In support of these observations, expression of H-Ras, a critical
mediator of bFGF signaling in cells, has been shown to inhibit
proapoptotic signaling by ASK1 in a Raf-1–dependent but MEK1/2and ERK1/2-independent manner (20).
Tumor growth depends on the production of growth factors
such as bFGF and VEGF that stimulate quiescent endothelium to
undergo angiogenesis, promoting increased EC proliferation and
tissue invasion. However, the cytoprotective effect of these growth
factors has been shown to provide chemoresistance to ECs, thus
attenuating the efficacy of anticancer therapies designed to
promote apoptosis. The observation that bFGF, but not VEGF,
preferentially protects ECs from apoptosis in response to genotoxic
stress (intrinsic pathway) may have significant ramifications
because conventional anticancer chemotherapeutic agents function, in part, as angiogenesis inhibitors by causing DNA damage
and promoting stress-mediated apoptosis of proliferating ECs
within the tumor (2). In fact, tumor-derived bFGF has been shown
to promote chemoresistance of both tumor cells as well as ECs
(32–37). Interestingly, inhibition of FGF receptor signaling has been
shown to enhance cellular susceptibility to genotoxic agents such
as doxorubicin and etoposide (32, 38). These observations support
the notion that administration of genotoxic drugs or ionizing
radiation, combined with agents that block growth factor–
mediated protection from stress may synergize to enhance the
efficacy anticancer therapy. Therefore, identification of apoptotic
signaling cascades targeted by angiogenic growth factors present
within the tumor microenvironment may enhance the design of
effective therapies that use antiangiogenics as chemosensitizing
agents.
