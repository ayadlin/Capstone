Abstract
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Pancreas cancer (PC), a highly aggressive tumour type with uniformly poor prognosis, is an
exemplar of the classical view of cancer development based on stepwise progression1. The current
progression model, based on analyses of precursor lesions termed pancreatic intraepithelial
neoplasm (PanINs) lesions, makes two predictions: 1) PC develops through a particular sequence
of genetic alterations2–5 (KRAS > CDKN2A > TP53/SMAD4); and 2) the evolutionary trajectory
of PC progression is gradual because each alteration is acquired independently. One shortcoming
of this nearly two decade old contention is that clonally expanded precursor lesions have been
identified that do not always belong to the tumour lineage2,5–9, indicating that the evolutionary
trajectory of the tumour lineage and precursor lesions can be divergent. This prevailing view of
tumourigenesis has contributed to the clinical notion that PC evolves slowly and presents at a late
stage10. However, the propensity for this disease to rapidly metastasize and the inability to
improve patient outcomes despite efforts aimed at early detection11, argue that PC progression is
anything but gradual. By tracking DNA copy number changes and their associated rearrangements
from tumour-enriched genomes using novel informatics tools, we found that PC tumourigenesis
neither is gradual nor follows the accepted mutation order. Two-thirds of tumours harbour complex
rearrangement patterns associated with mitotic errors, consistent with punctuated equilibrium as
the principal evolutionary trajectory12. In a subset of cases, the consequence of such errors was the
simultaneous, rather than sequential, knockout of canonical preneoplastic genetic drivers that
likely set-off invasive cancer growth. These findings challenge the current model of PC
tumourigenesis and provide novel insights into the mutational processes giving rise to these
aggressive tumours.

PC will be the second leading cause of cancer-related death within a decade, and the
biological basis for the aggressive nature of this disease is largely undefined. Motivated by
this, we explored the PC genome to address this concern. PC genomes are highly unstable13,
as evidenced by the drastic modifications to their DNA copy number (CN) landscape.
Although this instability is further exacerbated with metastatic progression14, it remains
unclear when the instability begins relative to the key genetic alterations that give rise to the
invasive clone. Also, whether this instability propagates through single CN changes that
accumulate one after another or through large numbers of concurrent changes, remains an
unsettled facet of the PC progression model. These questions have important basic and
translational implications for this lethal disease. As a first step, the mechanisms at the root
cause of this instability need to be identified. Mutational phenomena such as chromothripsis

and polyploidization have been linked to unstable tumours15,16 and aggressive tumour
behaviour, raising the possibility that they play a role in PC development. These particular
mutational phenomena are considered to accelerate cancer evolution because the DNA
damage ensuing from such mitotic errors must be resolved in one or few rounds of cell
division; otherwise the cell would die. To date, the extensive fibrosis in PC has obstructed
the sequencing resolution needed to clearly decipher these events. In this study, we
performed an in-depth analysis of over 100 whole genomes (Extended Data Fig. 1) from
purified primary and metastatic PC (referring to ductal adenocarcinoma only) with a focus
on mutational phenomena linked to rapid tumour progression.

Author Manuscript

To evaluate polyploidization, we developed and validated a new informatic tool, termed
CELLULOID, which can estimate tumour ploidy and CN from whole genome data (Fig. 1a;
Extended Data Fig. 2). We found that 45% (48/107) of tumours displayed CN changes
consistent with polyploidization (Ploidy solutions in Supplement). In polyploid tumours,
88% (42/48) were tetraploid and the rest were hexaploid. The mean ploidy of diploid
tumours was 1.95 versus those tumours that underwent genome duplication and triplication
was 3.03 and 5.21 (relative to 4 and 6), implying that a larger proportion of the genome was
lost in the latter subgroup (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), which is consistent with previous
data16. Polyploid tumours were enriched for mutations in TP53 (Extended Data Fig. 1e;
p=0.02, Fisher’s exact test), and harboured 1.5 fold higher CN alterations compared to
diploid tumours (median: 112 versus 77, p=0.003, t-test; Extended Data Fig. 3c). The
dramatic loss of genomic material relative to baseline ploidy and increased number of CN
alterations in polyploids demonstrates that their genomes are highly unstable.

Author Manuscript

We then used mutation data to infer the timing of the polyploidization event in tumour
evolution (Supplementary results). All cases were first categorized according to their
dominant mutational signature since specific aetiologies drive mutation accrual17. Two
subgroups were evident: one where C>T transitions dominated, likely related to cytosine
deamination with aging (termed ‘Age-related’: ~80%); and a second where all six classes of
base substitutions were more or less balanced, a phenomenon linked to defects in doublestrand break repair (termed DSBR: 17%; Extended Data Fig. 3d). Accordingly, half of the
DSBR cases carried germline or somatic mutations in BRCA1/213. The remaining cases
were comprised of heterogeneous signatures previously identified by Alexandrov et al17
(Extended Data Fig. 3d).

Author Manuscript

We found that most mutations preceded polyploidization in both the Age-related and DSBR
subgroups (Fig. 1b). By contrast, most CN losses and gains occurred after polyploidization,
an effect that was dramatically magnified when the size of the CN change was taken into
account (losses: p=4.3×10−7; gains: p=0.003, t-test; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 3e). This
implies that CN changes that precede polyploidization were smaller and focal; whereas,
those that came after were larger and more structurally damaging to the genome. Some of
these larger changes are likely a consequence of the improper segregation of chromosomal
material gained during polyploidization. CN alterations corresponding to the
polyploidization event commonly resided at integer values indicating that such events are
near or fully clonal (CELLULOID solutions in Supplement). Two conclusions emerge from
these data: 1) polyploidization occurs after an extended diploid phase of mutation accrual; 2)

the CN changes related to polyploidization come to rapidly dominate in a shorter timeframe
suggesting they are relevant to disease progression.

Many diploid and polyploid tumours harboured focal CN alterations that oscillated between
a few DNA copy states, a telltale sign of chromothripsis15. We developed a sensitive
algorithm, termed Chrom-AL, to differentiate chromothripsis from localized gradual events
that accumulate over time (Supplementary Results). We found that a striking 65.4% (70/107)
of PC harboured at least one chromothripsis event (Chrom-AL solutions in Supplement). A
similar frequency was observed in an independent genome cohort (60%, n=50/84,
Supplementary Results). Eleven percent of all chromothripsis events resided on chr18
(Extended Data Fig. 4a) resulting in the loss of a key tumour suppressor gene, SMAD4. By
comparing the consensus CN profiles of cases with and without chromothripsis, we found
that SMAD4 loss was accompanied by a gain in a region of chr18 that harbours GATA6, an
oncogene implicated in PC development (Extended Data Fig. 4b, top panel; Supplementary
Fig. 1). Furthermore, 8% percent of events were observed on chr12. The consensus CN
profile of these cases revealed a focal amplification in the region of KRAS (Extended Data
Fig. 4b, middle panel). These amplifications commonly affected the mutant KRAS allele
either directly when chromothripsis and breakage-fusion-bridge cycles were combined
(Extended Data Fig. 4c, Pcsi_0290), or indirectly when polyploidization was subsequent to a
chromothripsis event that removed the wildtype copy (Extended Data Fig. 4c, Pcsi_0356).
There was significantly more chromothripsis in polyploids than in diploids, agreeing with
greater genomic instability in the former subgroup (Extended Data Fig. 4d; p=0.013,
Fisher’s exact test). We observed a worse overall survival for patients whose tumours had
such an event (p=0.025, log-rank test; Supplementary Fig. 2). The high prevalence of
chromothripsis in PC combined with the previously established link between chromothripsis
and aggressive tumour behaviour in other cancers15,18, strongly implicate this mutational
processes as a key part of PC development. Importantly, these data directly support the
‘catastrophic’ model of PC progression proposed by Real19 more than a decade ago.

We next performed a series of focused analyses using individual cases to illustrate the broad
principles of the approach applied to the genome cohort. An important question arising from
the above data is how much of the overall genomic instability in these tumours can be
attributed to a single chromothripsis event. In Pcsi_0082, a tetraploid tumour, 63% of all CN
changes could be attributed to five distinct chromothripsis events on chr8, chr13, chr15,
chr16 and chr18 (Extended Data Fig. 5a). As chromothripsis is sustained and resolved in a
single cell division20,21, we can approximate that more than half of the genomic damage in
Pcsi_0082 was incurred from roughly five aberrant mitoses. Because Pcsi_0082 had
undergone polyploidization, we were able to infer the timing of chromothripsis events
relative to the genome doubling using the magnitude of the CN changes. Considering that
chromothripsis occurs on one copy of DNA, the events sustained on chr13, chr16 and chr18
occurred after polyploidization because the CN changes on these chromosomes vary mostly
by one (Extended Data Fig. 5a, ➁, , ). By contrast, the chromothripsis on chr8 and
chr15 occurred before polyploidization when the tumour was still diploid since these CN
changes vary in multiples of two as a result of genome doubling (➀, ). Across all
polyploid tumours, we observed that more than half (59%) of all chromothripsis events
transpired before polyploidization (Chrom-AL solutions). This suggests that

polyploidization further exacerbates the preexisting genomic instability in these tumours.
Overall, many CN alterations in PC are acquired through rapid bursts of genetic change from
a single or few cataclysmic events (Extended Data Fig. 5b) rather than a set of gradual
events that accumulate overtime.

Author Manuscript

To investigate these mitotic cataclysms in disease progression, we analyzed the genomes of
15 distinct metastases from six cases (Extended Data 6; Supplementary results). In one case
of fulminant metastatic progression (Pcsi_0410), eight distinct metastases were sequenced
(progression timeline: Fig. 2a). All metastases were polyploid and also carried two distinct
chromothripsis events: one on chr6, and another on chr8 that resulted in the striking
amplification of c-MYC (20 – 40 copies) resembling a double minute or a variant of a
cancer neochromosome22 (Fig. 2b,c; Extended Data Fig. 7a). The final CN in areas of loss
of heterozygosity (LOH) in both chromothripsis events reside at 2 indicating they occurred
before polyploidization (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Using FISH, we confirmed that the
primary tumour was also polyploid and harboured chromothripsis (Fig. 2c; Supplementary
Fig. 3a,b). Thus, we can infer that both chromothripsis events preceded polyploidization,
and systemic spread of the disease ensued after polyploidization by a clone that harboured
all three cataclysms (Fig. 2d). An additional chromothripsis event was detected on chr13 in
the adrenal gland metastasis (Supplementary Fig. 3c), consistent with previous data on
ongoing instability with metastatic progression14. Overall, we observed that chromothripsis
was maintained in metastases if present in the primary tumour (Extended Data Fig. 6d).
These data support that the bulk of genomic instability precedes metastases and is fostered
early in tumourigenesis. If the dominant clonal lineage of the primary tumour arises from
these types of mitotic errors, it leads to the hypothesis that intra-tumoural heterogeneity in
PC10 follows this event, akin to the ‘big-bang’ model proposed for colon cancer23.

The central tenet of the PanIN progression model posits that alterations in KRAS,
CDKN2A, TP53 and SMAD4 are acquired as part of consecutive events. To directly test this
model, we used DNA rearrangements to reconstruct the evolutionary history of allelic losses
of tumour suppressors based on evidence that allelic alterations are the first hit in
tumourigenesis (Supplementary results and Luttges et al5). Ashpc_0005, a tetraploid tumour,
had a complex pattern of rearrangements involving chromosomes 9, 17 and 18 where
CDKN2A, TP53 and SMAD4 reside (Fig. 3a). Several features of this rearrangement pattern
facilitate the reconstruction of the mutational events in this tumour. First, there are two
independent sets of rearrangements on chr9 (Fig. 3b; window 1 and window 2) that flank
CDKN2A indicating that the two copies of this gene were lost as part of independent
chromothripsis events. Second, there are distinct amplified DNA segments in window 2 (Fig.
3c) bounded by a specific type of rearrangement referred to as a fold-back inversion which
leave behind steep CN drops (>2) indicative of a cycle of breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB)14.
Three steep CN drops in window 2 are evidence of three cycles of BFB (Fig. 3c). Third, the
intervening CN change (from 10 to 8) on one of these amplified segments, suggests that
chromothripsis event followed three cycles of BFB and was likely the final major event that
stabilized the derivative chromosome24 (Fig. 3c, second to last panel). Fourth, all CN
changes in the event are in multiples of two, indicating that polyploidization followed the
BFB cycles and chromothripsis (Fig. 3a). Finally, the CN change on chr18 from 3 to 1
(instead of 4 to 2) indicates that one wildtype copy of this chromosome was lost after

polyploidization (Fig. 3a). The relative order of the first and the second copy losses of
CDKN2A cannot be deciphered, but a single cataclysmic event involving BFB and
chromothripsis knocked out a single copy of CDKN2A, TP53 and SMAD4 in synchronized
fashion (Fig. 3d,e). Using rearrangements to reconstruct the sequence of events in a second
case (Pcsi_0171) demonstrated a single chromothripsis simultaneously knocked out
CDKN2A and SMAD4 (Extended Data Fig. 8). Notably, rearrangement patterns in 16% of
cases (17/107) combined allelic alterations in KRAS, CDKN2A, TP53 and SMAD4 genes,
predominantly as double knockouts (14% if only tumour suppressor genes are considered;
Supplementary Fig. 4). In a proof of principle experiment using single cell sequencing in a
tumour where rearrangements did not span these genes, we found an ancestral clone that
harboured a SMAD4 loss but retained TP53 and CDKN2A (Extended Data Fig. 9). These
data provide direct evidence that a number of cases do not conform to the accepted
mutational hierarchy predicted by the PanIN progression model and warrant future
investigation into the sequence of mutational events that give rise to these aggressive
tumours.

Studies dating back two decades have been critical in molding the current perspective of
how PC develops1. Key features of our data provide a framework to broaden this view. First,
analysis on polyploid tumours revealed that most mutations accumulate when these tumours
are still diploid. Assuming that preneoplastic cells are diploid, a fraction of these mutations
must be preneoplastic. In line with this reasoning, Murphy et al. have demonstrated that
preneoplasms in PC acquire extensive mutation burden but remain non-invasive25. This
suggests a prolonged preneoplastic phase predates the onset of invasive disease and that CN
events are crucial for transformation (Extended Data Fig. 10). These data carry implications
for the design of future studies on early detection of PC11. Second, CN changes from
chromothripsis are essentially clonal suggesting that these events are sustained early in
tumourigenesis. The inactivation of well-known preneoplastic drivers (CDKN2A, TP53,
SMAD4) en bloc strongly supports this notion and implies that chromothripsis can be a
transforming event under the right gene context18,24. Our data also raise the possibility that
some PCs may not progress through a linear series of PanIN lesions19. Why cataclysmic
phenomena are so frequent in PC cannot be easily answered. Perhaps the extensive fibrosis
in these tumours, known to suppress tumour development26,27, plays a role in applying a
selective pressure that favours punctuated events over gradual ones. Lastly, PC is well
known for its proclivity to metastasize. In mouse models of PC, genomic instability
contributes to metastatic progression28. If chromothripsis is indeed the transforming event in
some tumours, as our data suggests, a single event could thus confer a cell with both invasive
and metastatic properties. In this scenario, there would be a very short latency period
between the birth of the invasive clone and the ability of that clone to send volleys of
metastatic seeds29,30. This fits the logic of why 80% of PC patients present with advanced
disease at diagnosis. How these mutational processes contribute to disease progression and
metastatic phenotype becomes a critical topic of investigation; such knowledge will be
essential to guide more effective screening and therapeutic strategies for PC and conceivably
for other aggressive tumour types as well.

even values), the estimate of cellularity would have to be decreased. Indeed, in order to
maintain an allelic ratio at a given value, the proportion of tumour cells has to be reduced to
compensate the higher number of copies in them (from a cellularity value t to a value t/(2-t)
in the case of a doubling of the ploidy). A test can thus be designed to verify that ploidy
estimates have not been systematically over- or underestimated, simply by comparing the

and paired end whole genome sequencing was performed using HiSeq 2500. Single cells
were sequenced to a median whole genome depth of 3.9X (Supplementary Fig. 18). Only
cells with enough whole genome coverage (n=70) were used in the analysis. This
sequencing depth allowed us to track heterozygous SNPs across the whole genome in single
cells. Using this methodology, we were able to follow LOH events across the whole genome
in single cells with high concordance with bulk tumour (Supplementary Fig. 18).
Hierarchical clustering based on LOH events across the whole genome was performed and
found 4 independent cell clusters. (b) Specific LOH events on chr3, chr9, chr17 and chr18
are shown from representative single cells. The chromothripsis event on chr3 is shown in
greater detail in Fig. 2a. Summary of the sequence of allelic losses is shown on the bottom.
Supportive data that allelic losses precede mutational inactivation is shown in
Supplementary Figure 13 and Supplementary Figure 14. (c) Representative plot of the
shared chromosomal breakpoint on chr18 on the bulk (top), preneoplastic single cell
(middle) and tumour single cell (bottom). (d) Classical model of pancreas tumour

Extended Data Figure 10. Theoretical model of PC tumour progression

The classical model of tumour evolution driven by a gradual pace (grey), and an alternate
model driven by punctuated equilibrium (red). In gradualism, there is a period of latency
between driver alterations that lead to tumour development, and multiple, independent
transforming events are required for tumour development (top – grey line; bottom left). In
punctuated equilibrium, tumour development can be divided into two major events: the
cancer-initiating event and cancer-transforming event (top – red; bottom right). Under this

model, most mutations (indicated with x) would accrue in an extended phase of
preneoplastic tumour development. Transformation, likely due to a genomic instability from
copy number changes (arrow heads) ensuing from cataclysmic event, would rapidly lead to
invasive cancer and metastases. Classical drivers (KRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, SMAD4) from
the PanIN progression model are overlaid onto these models. Theoretical PanIN stages are
shown as P1–P3.
