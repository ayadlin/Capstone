ABSTRACT
We provide first-time evidence for ERβ-mediated transcriptional upregulation of
c-FLIP as an underlying mechanism in the development of castrate-resistant cancer.
While androgens inhibit apoptosis partly through transcriptional upregulation of
the anti-apoptotic protein, c-FLIP in androgen-responsive cells, they downregulate
c-FLIP in androgen-independent cells. We found that although Sp1 and p65 transactivate c-FLIP, the combination of Sp1 and p65 has differential effects in a cellular
context-dependent manner. We show that activation of the androgen metabolism
enzyme, aldo-keto reductase, AKR1C1, relieves androgen independence through
activation of 3β-Adiol-mediated upregulation of ERβ. ERβ competes with Sp1 and
Sp3 to transcriptionally downregulate c-FLIP in the absence of consensus estrogenresponse element in androgen-independent cells. Forced expression of AR in androgenindependent cells show that ERβ-mediated growth inhibition occurs under conditions
of androgen independence. Reactivation of ERβ with the estrogenic metabolite,
2-methoxyestradiol, decreased enrichment ratio of Sp1/Sp3 at the c-FLIP promoter
with concomitant effects on cell growth and death. Expression of Sp1 and c-FLIP
are elevated while AKR1C1, ERβ and Sp3 are significantly low in human prostate
tumor samples. ERβ is epigenetically silenced in prostate cancer patients, therefore
our results suggest that combination of ERβ agonists with ADT would benefit men
stratified on the basis of high estrogen levels.

effective, the outcome is transient, invariably resulting
in progression to aggressive metastatic castrate-resistant
form (CRPC) with no effective curative options [2]. ADT
functions by causing apoptotic cell death of cancer cells.
However, advanced prostate cancer cells develop resistance
to ADT-induced apoptosis leading to development of
aggressive castrate-resistant status [3]. Additionally, though
PCA is an androgen-dependent disease, levels of androgens

INTRODUCTION
The binding of androgens to the androgen receptor
(AR) plays an important role not only in the growth and
development of normal prostate, but also in prostatic diseases
including prostate cancer (PCA). Accordingly, androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay therapeutic
approach for locally advanced PCA [1]. Although initially

decrease while estrogens increase with age [4]. Accordingly,
it was suggested that rather than androgens per se, the
ratio of androgen to estrogens may be a potential reason
for development of CRPCA [5]. This is corroborated by
emerging evidence implicating a role of estrogen receptors
(ERs) primarily α and β (ERα and β) in prostate cancer cells
and human prostate tumors [6, 7]. Furthermore, ectopic
expression of ERβ inhibits growth, migration, invasion
and epithelial mesenchymal transition of prostate cancer
cells and ERβ knockout mice develop hyperplasia and
PIN lesions [7, 8]. However, the underlying mechanism
of ERβ-mediated prostate pathogenesis including CRPCA
is undefined. Studies to understand the molecular events
associated with CRPCA identified an important role for
the anti-apoptotic FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) [11].
c-FLIP is aberrantly expressed in high-grade and castrateresistant human prostate tumors. Furthermore, nude mice
implanted with c-FLIP overexpressing LNCaP cells develop
androgen independent prostate tumors suggesting androgen
regulation of c-FLIP. Evidence from epidemiological and
laboratory studies indicate lower PCA incidence in men
consuming soy products [12]. Gut microbial digestion of
these products generates estrogenic metabolites with antitumorigenic activity [12]. Along these lines, studies from
number of laboratories including our own demonstrated antitumorigenic activity for a non-toxic endogenous estrogenic
metabolite 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME2) in multiple
tumor types in vitro and in vivo [13–17]. In addition,
downregulation of c-FLIP by 2-ME2 has been reported to
inhibit tumor growth in vitro and in vivo [13–17]. Despite
the circumstantial evidence, the underlying mechanism
through which androgens and loss of ERβ influence c-FLIP
deregulation during prostate carcinogenesis and whether
2-ME2-mediated inhibition of prostate tumor development
involves ERβ/c-FLIP remains to be defined.
Here we investigated the functional interaction
between androgen metabolism-mediated activation of
ERβ as a possible underlying mechanism involved in
deregulation of c-FLIP. We provide evidence that c-FLIP is
negatively regulated by ERβ possibly through modulation
of Sp1/Sp3 binding to its promoter. We also provide
evidence that inhibition of Sp1 activation coupled with
ERβ activation with 2-ME2 suppresses tumor cell growth
and induces apoptosis. These findings identify ERβ as a
negative modulator of c-FLIP and suggest strategies to target
ERβ activation either directly or by enhancing androgen
metabolism enzyme AKR1C1 along with AR inhibition as a
novel approach for effective management of CRPCA.

suppressing transcriptional activation of c-FLIP, the
molecular mechanism through which 2-ME2 suppresses
c-FLIP activation is not defined [13]. Transient expression
assays using exonuclease deletion constructs spanning
the 5′-flanking region of c-FLIP promoter element
identified –121/+242 sequence with maximal constitutive
reporter activity in both androgen-responsive LNCaP
and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells PC-3
and DU145 cells (Fig. 1A-1C). Interestingly, promoter
activity increased significantly in response to androgens
(5α-DHT stimulation) in LNCaP cells (Fig. 1C and data
not shown). Constitutive c-FLIP promoter activity in PC-3
and DU145 cells or 5α-DHT-stimulated activity in LNCaP
cells decreased following treatment with 2-ME2. Inclusion
of sequence elements upstream of –121 not only decreased
the basal promoter activity but also the 2-ME2 response.
These data suggest that 2-ME2 response elements are
located within sequence elements –121/+242 and that this
sequence element was sufficient to maintain the c-FLIP
core promoter activity.
Analysis of –121/+242 sequence identified
putative binding sites for multiple transcription factors
including AR, Sp1 and NFκB (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Therefore, we tested the impact of ectopic expression of
Sp1, Sp3 and p65 (NFκB) on c-FLIP promoter activity
using co-transfections. Ectopic expression of Sp1 or
p65 transactivated c-FLIP in all three prostate cancer
cell lines (Fig. 1D-1F). The observed p65-mediated
transactivation was repressed in cells co-transfected
with phosphorylation defective IκBα indicating the
specificity of NFκB-mediated effects. Interestingly, we
observed differential effects of co-transfection with Sp1
on p65 transactivation of c-FLIP promoter. Sp1 repressed
p65 transactivation of c-FLIP in DU145 and LNCaP
cells (Fig.  1E-1F) with no significant effect in PC-3
cells (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, ectopic expression of Sp3
or treatment with 2-ME2 inhibited both Sp1 and p65mediated transactivation (Fig. 1D-1F). These data suggest
(i) Sp1 as master regulator of c-FLIP; and (ii) either Sp1
or p65 can individually transactivate c-FLIP, and that the
combination of Sp1 and p65 can have differential effects
depending on the cell type.

Identification and characterization of DNAprotein complexes binding to c-FLIP promoter
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) was
used to examine whether Sp1 regulates endogenous c-FLIP
in the context of chromatin using overlapping binding sites
for Sp1 and p65 (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Chromatin
immunoprecipitated extracts from untreated DU145 but
not PC-3 cells with anti-Sp1 antibody amplified c-FLIP
sequence (Fig. 2A and 2B). It is noteworthy to mention
here that Sp1 was recruited to the c-FLIP sequences
upstream of –833 (data not shown). In contrast, in LNCaP
cells significant enrichment of Sp1 was observed only

immunoprecipitated extracts with anti-p65 specifically
bound these sequences that was abolished with 2-ME2 in
PC-3 cells (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data suggest
multiple transcription factors including Sp1, Sp3 and
NFκB differentially regulate c-FLIP depending on the cell
type and recruitment of both Sp1 and p65 to overlapping
sites of c-FLIP promoter.
To examine if Sp1 and p65 regulate c-FLIP by
binding to the same sequence elements, gel super-shift
experiments were conducted using c-FLIP promoter
sequence (+64/+89 containing AR, Sp1 and NFκB
overlapping bindings sites; Supplementary Fig. S1C) as
radiolabeled probe. Given our data suggesting differential
regulation of c-FLIP between LNCaP and DU145
vs. PC-3, we performed gel shift experiments using
LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Nuclear extracts from PC-3 or
5α-DHT-stimulated LNCaP cells formed three distinct
DNA-protein complexes (Complex I, II and III; Fig. 2D
and 2E). The observed complexes were either completely
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(CI and II) or partially (CIII) abolished in response to
2-ME2 treatment (lane 3). Competition experiments
using c-FLIP oligo or mutant Sp1 oligonucleotide as
homologous or heterologous competitors respectively
abolished both CI and II but CIII was partially abolished
(lanes 4 and 5). These data suggest the presence of Sp1,
Sp-related and factors other than Sp1 in these complexes.
Pre-incubation of nuclear extracts with antibodies against
Sp1 and Sp3 showed super-shifted complexes (lanes
6 and 7; indicated as SS) or reduced complex formation
with p65 and p50 (lanes 8 and 9) in both cell types. In
addition, pre-incubation of nuclear extracts from LNCaP
cells with AR antibody partially abolished the observed
DNA-protein complex indicating the presence of AR in
androgen-responsive cells (lane 5a).
Previous studies have demonstrated the presence
of androgen response element (ARE)-1 within this
sequence [20]. These data prompted us to perform gel shift
experiments using c-FLIP sequence containing wild type
ARE-1 (Supplementary Fig. S1D). 5α-DHT-stimulated

nuclear extracts from LNCaP cells showed enhanced
binding to this sequence that was reduced in response to
2-ME2 (lanes 3 and 4; Fig. 2F). Competition experiments
using ARE1 with mutation in conserved binding site
eliminated the observed DNA-protein complex indicating
the presence of factors other than AR, including Sp1 and
p65 (lane 5; Fig. 2F). Taken together, these data show
the presence of AR, Sp1 and p65 in CI and Sp3 in CII
and suggest that AR bound c-FLIP promoter sequence
containing Sp1/NFκB sequences is upregulated in
response to androgens in LNCaP cells.

with PC-3 cells (Fig. 3E). In contrast, 3β-Adiol but not
ERβ decreased c-FLIP promoter activity in LNCaP cells
(Fig. 3E bottom panel). Given the differential status of AR
between LNCaP and PC3 & DU145 cells, we reasoned
that the presence of AR could be a contributing factor
for the observed differential regulation of c-FLIP by
ERβ. To address this, we performed similar experiments
using PC-3 cells stably overexpressing AR (PC-3 AR).
Intriguingly, we did not observe ERβ-mediated down
regulation of c-FLIP promoter activity in these cells
(Fig. 3F). These data suggest that metabolic inactivation
of 5α-DHT by AKR1C1 could produce 3β-Adiol, which
in turn reduces c-FLIP transcriptional activation possibly
via ERβ activation. Furthermore, AR inhibits ERβmediated inhibition of c-FLIP activation. Given the lack
of consensus estrogen response element in the c-FLIP
promoter, how ERβ suppresses c-FLIP is unclear.

Androgen down regulate c-FLIP activation in
androgen independent cells
These results prompted us to examine if Sp1/p65 can
mediate androgen regulation of c-FLIP in the absence of
AR using AR-negative DU145 cells. Surprisingly, c-FLIP
promoter activity was significantly decreased in response
to 5α-DHT in these cells (lane 3; Fig. 3A). Consistent
with data presented in Fig. 1B, 2-ME2 further reduced the
observed basal and 5α-DHT-inhibited c-FLIP promoter
activity (lanes 2 and 4; Fig. 3A). This unexpected finding
prompted us to test if the detected 5α-DHT-mediated
effects are related to its metabolism. Therefore, we
conducted these experiments using non-metabolizable
androgen R1881. Interestingly, R1881 had no significant
effect on c-FLIP activation, albeit 2-ME2 decreased (lanes
5 and 6; Fig. 3A). Next we investigated if the observed
5α-DHT-mediated decrease in c-FLIP activation is related
to reduced Sp1 enrichment at the promoter. ChIP analysis
showed significant enrichment of Sp3 and non-significant
increase in Sp1 (relative to control IgG antibody) at the
endogenous c-FLIP promoter in response to 5α-DHT
but not R1881 treatment (lanes 2&7 and 4&9; Fig. 3B).
Remarkably, 2-ME2-treatment showed 10-fold higher
enrichment of Sp3 (relative to control IgG antibody) to
the endogenous c-FLIP promoter following 5α-DHTstimulation (lane 8; Fig. 3B). These results suggest that
5α-DHT metabolic products could be involved in the
observed 5α-DHT-induced downregulation of c-FLIP.
Aldo-keto reductase, AKR1C1 predominantly
metabolizes 5α-DHT into 3β-Adiol, a physiological
ligand for ERβ [21]. We examined alterations in the
expression of AKR1C1 and ERβ in DU145 cells and
found that 5α-DHT and 2-ME2 significantly up-regulated
mRNA expression of AKR1C1 and ERβ (Fig. 3C). These
correlative results led us to hypothesize that metabolic
inactivation of 5α-DHT by AKR1C1 could produce
3β-Adiol that in turn reduces c-FLIP transcriptional
activation via ERβ activation. To directly test this, we
examined c-FLIP transactivation by ectopically expressing
ERβ or pharmacologically by treating cells with 3β-Adiol.
Ectopic expression of ERβ (left panel) or treatment with
3β-Adiol (right panel) decreased c-FLIP promoter activity
significantly (Fig. 3D). Similar results were also obtained
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ERβ competes with Sp1 and Sp3 for binding to
c-FLIP promoter
Previous studies have shown that estrogen receptors
can regulate gene expression non-genomically through
interactions with other transcription factors such as Sp1
[22, 23]. We tested this hypothesis using co-transfection
assays in DU145 cells. Consistent with data presented
in Figs. 1E and 3D; ectopic expression of Sp1 transactivated while Sp3 trans-repressed Sp1-mediated
activation (lanes 2 and 3; Fig. 4A). On the other hand,
ectopic ERβ expression not only suppressed constitutive &
Sp1-mediated activation but also Sp3-mediated inhibition
c-FLIP activation (lanes 4–7; Fig. 4A). Furthermore,
ectopic ERβ expression further suppressed Sp3-mediated
inhibition of Sp1 transactivation (lane 8; Fig. 4A).
Although the biological significance of these observations
is unclear, these results imply that ERβ suppresses c-FLIP
transcriptional activity possibly by competing with Sp1
and Sp3. Biological relevance of 5α-DHT or 2-ME2mediated suppression of c-FLIP activation was determined
by examining the effect of 5α-DHT on cell growth
and apoptosis in the presence and absence of 2-ME2.
Treatment with 5α-DHT significantly decreased colonyforming ability of DU145 cells. Decreased colony forming
ability was further reduced in the presence of 2-ME2
(Fig. 4B). Immunoblot analysis revealed dose-dependent
increase in PARP cleavage and decreased FLIPL (Fig. 4C).
These observations suggest that ERβ can inhibit growth
of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells through
transcriptional downregulation of c-FLIP and activation
of apoptosis.
We analyzed the expression of Sp1 and Sp3
in human prostate tissues by immunohistochemistry
(IHC). IHC analysis revealed significantly elevated Sp1
expression (27/35 human prostate tumors; p = 0.035) with
no detectable expression in the normal tissue (Fig.  5A
and  Table 1). However, differences in Sp3 expression

data demonstrating tumor suppressor role for ERβ is in
agreement with these published findings.
Additionally, we provide evidence that ERβ inhibits
apoptosis non-genomically by competing with Sp1 and Sp3
to transcriptionally downregulate c-FLIP. Given the lack
of understanding how ERβ activation inhibits apoptosis to
drive prostate pathogenesis, our observations are novel.
Estrogen receptors (ERs) regulate gene expression either
classically by binding to estrogen response element (ERE)
in the promoter regions or non-classically in association
with other transcription factors including AP-1, Sp1
and NFκB [22]. Genome-wide global profiling of ERβ
occupancy studies indicate that ERE is not the major
binding site for ERβ, but it can bind to sites including Sp1
[23]. Data presented in this manuscript provide evidence
that 2-ME2 (i) inhibits Sp1 transactivation of c-FLIP; (ii)
activates ERβ in a dose-dependent manner and (iii) that
ectopic expression of ERβ or treatment with its ligand
3β-Adiol suppresses c-FLIP promoter activity despite
lack of consensus ERE. The observed downregulation
of c-FLIP is associated with induction of apoptosis in
prostate cancer cells. Based on these observations, we
speculate that ERβ downregulates c-FLIP either directly
by binding to Sp1 sites on the c-FLIP promoter or by
modulating the ratio of Sp1/Sp3 through competitive

DISCUSSION
Recent evidence shows the importance of androgen
metabolism in the progression of prostate cancer to
castrate-resistant state. Here, we show for the first time
that AKR1C1 can contribute to CRPCA by inhibiting
apoptosis through ERβ-mediated transcriptional
suppression of c-FLIP. The tumor suppressive role for
ERβ has been reported using in vitro cell culture and
in vivo animal models [6–10]. It has also been reported
that human prostate cancer cells express both ERα and
β and ERβ knockout mice develop HGPIN lesions [9].
Furthermore, in silico analysis revealed significantly
decreased expression of both AKR1C1 and ERβ in human
prostate tumors compared to normal tissue. Therefore, our

DNA binding. Alternatively, involvement of other ERβ
coregulators cannot be ruled out. Additionally, it is also
possible that 2-ME2-treatment can activate epigenetically
silenced ERβ through demethylation. It has been reported
that due to methylation of the ERβ promoter, relative
ERβ expression is undetectable in LNCaP and very low
in DU145 cells compared to PC-3 cells [26]. Since our
results show that treatment with 2-ME2 resulted in dosedependent increased ERβ expression in DU145 cells they
signify the possibility that 2-ME2-treatment can activate
epigenetically silenced ERβ through demethylation, which
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

will be a focus of our future studies. Taken together, these
observations for the first time suggest that loss of ERβ can
contribute to aggressive advanced prostate cancer through
transcriptional regulation of c-FLIP.
Sp1 and NFκB are transcription factors that regulate
expression of genes involved in various cellular processes
of oncogenesis including differentiation, apoptosis, cell
migration, and cell cycle progression [27, 28]. Moreover,
published studies show correlation between elevated
levels of NFκB in castrate-resistant prostate tumors and
disease progression [29]. However, to the best of our

knowledge no studies have examined the expression of
Sp1 and Sp3 in human prostate tumors. The current study
for the first time demonstrates elevated expression of Sp1
in human prostate tumors compared to normal tissue.
These observations are consistent with published studies
in other tumor types [30–32]. For example, in comparison
to normal tissues or cells Sp1 levels are higher in breast,
thyroid, hepatocellular, pancreatic, colorectal, gastric and
lung cancer. In addition, abnormal Sp1 levels are highly
correlated with stage and poor prognosis of cancer [31].
Our data also shows potential combinatorial effects
of Sp1 with AR, Sp3 and p65 in the regulation of c-FLIP
transcription. Treatment with pro-apoptotic agent 2-ME2
also blocked the observed effects. Sp1 and Sp3 both
bind GC-rich sequences and regulate gene expression
either thorough cooperative interactions or inhibitory
interactions whereby Sp3 can decrease Sp1 transactivation.
Furthermore, published evidence demonstrates that Sp1
can also regulate gene expression in association with
ligand activated and orphan nuclear receptors including
AR, ER, progesterone receptor (PR) and retinoic acid
receptor (RAR). Sp1 and/or Sp3 also cooperatively
activate gene expression through interaction with other
transcription factors including E2F, SMADs, NFκB,
GATA and c-Jun [28]. Previous studies have demonstrated
association between Sp1 and AR. For example, it has
been shown that despite lack of consensus ARE, AR can
transactivate p21 by binding to Sp1 sequence elements
in association with Sp1 in response to androgens [33]. In
addition, Sp1 stimulates AR target gene PSA through its
transcriptional activation ability. Inhibition or knocking
down of Sp1 to normal cellular level has been reported to
decrease tumor formation, growth and metastasis [34–37].
For example, chemopreventive agents including Betulinic
acid and Curcumin reduce the expression of Sp1 and
Sp3 with consequent reduced expression of their target

genes including EGFR, Cyclin D1, VEGF and SREB2.
Mithramycin A and tolfenamic acid together reduce
Sp1 levels in pancreatic cancer cells. Thus, interactions
between Sp1 and other proteins can differentially affect
Sp1-dependent transactivation depending on the promoter
context [27, 28]. In agreement with these published
findings, our work demonstrates that 2-ME2-mediated
restoration of ERβ prevents Sp1 or p65 recruitment or
combination of both Sp1 and p65 to c-FLIP promoter
with consequent induction of apoptosis. In future studies,
we will determine whether binding of Sp1 facilitates
recruitment of NFκB or vice versa.
Surprisingly, the current study also observed that
treatment with metabolizable androgens such as 5α-DHT
but not non-metabolizable R1881 lowers enrichment
of Sp1 and increase enrichment of Sp3 to the c-FLIP
promoter leading to reduced transcriptional activation
and inhibition of colony formation in DU145 cells.
How might treatment with 5α-DHT in AR negative
cells contribute to growth suppression? AKR family
members including AKR1C1, C2 and C3 function as
3-,  17- and 20-ketoseteroid reductases respectively to
form 3-α/β, 17-β and 20-α-hydroxyl metabolites [21, 38].
For example, inactivation of 5α-DHT by AKR1C1 results
in the formation of 3β-Adiol, a potent ERβ ligand [21].
Interestingly, the intraprostatic levels of 3β-Adiol, was
reported to be 100-fold higher than estradiol [21]. Data
presented here shows (i) expression of AKR1C1 decreases
in human prostate tumors, (ii) 5α-DHT enhances AKR1C1
expression; (iii) both 3β-Adiol and ERβ suppress c-FLIP
activation in DU145 and PC-3 cells but not in LNCaP
cells. It is noteworthy to mention that PC-3 cells are
more sensitive to 3β-Adiol, which could be related to
relatively higher expression of ERβ as it is unmethylated.
These observations are consistent with the hypothesis
that variations in the intraprostatic levels of 3β-Adiol

can potentially dictate the outcome of AR/ER signaling
and possibly the disparate increased risk of CRPCA by
preventing apoptosis via c-FLIP. Hypothetical model is
shown in Fig. 6. In future studies, we will determine the
crosstalk between ERβ and androgen metabolism and
how other nuclear receptors including ERα impact the
biological outcome.
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer
related deaths in men. Localized cancer can be treated
effectively either by surgery or radiation [39]. The first
line therapy, ADT though initially effective, progresses
to castrate-resistant disease in a majority of patients [40].
There are no effective curative approaches for treatment
of castrate-resistant disease. It is well accepted that AR
is activated in about 80% of castrate-resistant tumors
[41]. Several mechanisms including AR amplification/
overexpression, alteration in cofactors or AR variants
and crosstalk with signal transduction pathways plays a
critical role in the reactivation of AR [42, 43]. In addition,
emerging evidence demonstrates survival benefit and tumor
growth inhibition in patients by suppression of adrenal
androgen production by abiraterone acetate suggests a
pivotal role for intratumoral androgen metabolism [44].
Similarly, enzalutamide, which provides survival benefit
directly, inhibits AR activation [45]. Although these data
provide convincing evidence that androgen metabolism and
AR are critical targets for CRPC progression, resistance
to these agents is a major challenge for management of

CRPC. This is substantiated by recent data demonstrating
reactivation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a prevalent
mechanism of acquired resistance to enzalutamide [46].
Data presented in this manuscript provided evidence for
targeting c-FLIP either by increasing the levels of AKR1C1
or activating ERβ could have therapeutic potential. Do
changes in AKR1C1 lead to increase in c-FLIP expression
during CRPCA progression? How do interactions among
transcription factors Sp1/Sp3/NFκB/AR involved in
upregulation of c-FLIP contribute to CRPCA? Taken
together, these observations clearly indicate a conjectural
role for AKR1C1/ERβ/c-FLIP in prostate pathogenesis
that warrants additional investigations to elucidate the
regulation of c-FLIP with respect to androgen metabolism
and progression to CRPC. Furthermore, despite its ability
to exert anti-neoplastic activity in variety of tumor types,
2-ME2 was found to be clinically non-viable [47]. The
data presented in this manuscript justifies investigations
combining 2-ME2 with  ERβ agonists or 3β-Adiol for
effective management of CRPC.

Figure 6: Hypothetical model. Hypothetical model of ERβ-mediated transcriptional inhibition of c-FLIP. AKRC1 mediated inactivation
of 5α-DHT generates 3-β-Adiol, a potent ligand for ERβ. Activation of ERβ by 3-β-Adiol down regulates c-FLIP transcriptionally possibly
by regulating the binding of Sp and NFκB factors to the c-FLIP promoter. Furthermore, 5α-DHT-induced activation of AR could potentially
suppress ERβ-mediated transcriptional suppression of c-FLIP activation.

androgen independent (C4-2B) were obtained from
Dr. Thambi Dorai (Department of Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology, New York Medical College, NY). All
cells were grown essentially as described previously [18].
Logarithmically growing LNCaP, PC-3  and C4-2B

(St. Louis, MO)}.

activity was determined using Dual Luciferase Reporter
Assay system (Promega, Madison, WI).

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
EMSA and ChIP were essentially conducted as
described previously [13, 19]. For EMSA, Nuclear
extracts prepared from LNCaP, C4-2B, and PC-3
cells treated with 2-ME2 for 24 h were used in EMSA
experiments using 32P-labeled c-FLIP promoter sequence
oligonucleotide (+64/+89) containing overlapping
binding sites for Sp1, Sp3, p65 and AR. For competition
experiments, the radiolabeled probe was mixed with 100fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded synthetic
c-FLIP oligonucleotide for 5 min prior to the addition
of nuclear extracts. For super-shift experiments, nuclear
extracts were pre-incubated with Sp1, Sp3, p65, p50, AR
or control IgG antibodies for 30 min on ice prior to use
in EMSA. For ChIP, sheared, cross-linked protein-DNA
fragments were immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit
IgG (sc-2027), anti-Sp1 (sc-59 X) anti-Sp3 (sc-644 X)
antibody, or anti-p65 antibody (sc-372 X; obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and immune
complexes were absorbed with protein G magnetic beads
(Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). 10% of the input extract
was saved as input control for normalization before adding
antibody for immunoprecipitation. Cross-linking was then
reversed, and immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified by
PCR or quantitative PCR. PCR products were resolved
on 3% agarose gel. Densitometry was used to quantify
the PCR products and the results were normalized
to respective input values. For qPCR, triplicate PCR
reactions were performed for each sample and the data
are presented as the average ± S.E.M. and the results were
normalized to respective input values. Fold enrichment
was calculated as 100*2−(Ct[Target]−Ct[Input]).

Western blot analysis and quantitative real
time PCR
Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis was conducted
as described previously [18]. Primary antibodies used
include FLIPL (generated in-house), Cleaved PARP
(9541S; Cell signaling, Danvers, MA), and β-actin
(A5316; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Bound antibody
was visualized using ECL kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA). All the blots were stripped and reprobed
with β-actin to ensure equal loading of protein. Images
were captured and analyzed using Gene snap software
(Syngene, Frederick, MD), and quantification was carried
out using Gene tools software (Syngene, Frederick, MD).
Total cellular RNA isolated using Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Target genes
were amplified and expression was measured using
7300 Applied Biosystems with SYBR Green dye.
The primers used were as follows: β-actin, forward
5′-GGCACCCAGCACAATGAAGATCA-A-3′ and reverse
5′-TAGAAGC-ATTTGCGGTGGACGATG-3′; AKR1C1,
forward 5′-GCTTTAGAGGCCACCAA-ATTGGCA-3′
and reverse 5′-ACTGCCATCTGCAATCTTGCTTCG-3′;
ERβ, forward 5′-GGCACCTTTCTCCTT-TAGTG-3′
and reverse 5′-GGTGTGTTCTAGCGATCTTG-3′. PCR
reactions were conducted in triplicate, and relative mRNA
expression was normalized to β-actin. Fold change in
experiments was determined relative to solvent control
group. Specific amplification of target genes was validated
using a dissociation curve.

Clonogenic cell survival assay
For colony formation, DU145 cells seeded in
24-well plates at a density of 100 cells per well in 1 ml of
media were treated with 2-ME2 for 24 h in the presence
or absence of DHT (1 nM towards final 1 h of 24 h
treatment). Following this treatment, cells were washed
with PBS and media was replaced with fresh media with
no treatment. Following one week, cells were fixed with
ice-cold 100% methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal
violet in 20% methanol, and groups in excess of 15 cells
were counted as colonies.

Transient transfection
For transfections, human prostate cancer cells
were plated in triplicate at a density of 100,000 cells
per well in 24-well plates. Cells were transfected with
indicated c-FLIP reporter plasmids (0.5 μg) along with
Renilla luciferase (10 ng) using Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. For co-transfection
experiments, 0.5 μg/well of Sp1, Sp3, and/or ERβ was
used along with –121/+242 sequence of c-FLIP reporter
plasmid. Total amount of DNA was maintained constant
using backbone vector pcDNA3.1. Where necessary, cells
were treated with or without 2-ME2 for 24 h and luciferase
