Abstract
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase
(MKP)-1 is overexpressed in a large proportion of breast
cancers, and in some systems interferes with chemotherapymediated proapoptotic signaling through c-Jun-NH2-terminal
kinase (JNK). We therefore sought to examine whether MKP-1
is a mediator of breast cancer chemoresistance using
A1N4-myc human mammary epithelial cells, and BT-474 and
MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells. Transient or stable overexpression of MKP-1 reduced caspase activation and DNA
fragmentation while enhancing viability in the face of treatment with alkylating agents (mechlorethamine), anthracylines
(doxorubicin), and microtubule inhibitors (paclitaxel). This
overexpression was associated with suppression of JNK
activation, and JNK blockade alone induced similar effects.
In contrast, reduction of MKP-1 levels using a small interfering RNA, or its targeted inactivation, enhanced sensitivity
to these drugs, and this was associated with increased JNK
activity. Pharmacologic reduction of MKP-1 by pretreatment
with a novel p38 MAPK inhibitor, SD-282, suppressed MKP-1
activation by mechlorethamine, enhanced active JNK levels,
and increased alkylating agent–mediated apoptosis. Combination treatment with doxorubicin and mechlorethamine had
similar effects, and the enhanced efficacy of this regimen was
abolished by forced overexpression of MKP-1. These results
suggest that the clinical efficacy of combinations of alkylating agents and anthracyclines are due to the ability of the
latter to target MKP-1. Moreover, they support the hypothesis
that MKP-1 is a significant mediator of breast cancer chemoresistance, and provide a rationale for development and translation of other agents targeting MKP-1 into the clinical arena
to overcome resistance and induce chemosensitization.

Introduction
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase (MKP)-1
is the prototypic member of a family of dual-specificity phosphatases that dephosphorylate tyrosine and threonine residues
on target proteins. This phosphatase is best known for its specificity toward p44/42 MAPK (1), but recent studies showed
that MKP-1 has a substrate preference for p38 MAPK and c-Jun-

NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and limits JNK activity (2, 3). Many
chemotherapeutic agents induce apoptosis in part by activation
of the JNK pathway (4), which causes mitochondrial cytochrome c
release, leading to oligomerization of apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1). This cytochrome c/Apaf-1 complex recruits
pro–caspase-9, inducing its autoactivation, with subsequent
activation of the downstream effector caspase-3 (5–7). JNK family
members are also involved in activation of programmed cell death
by transcription-dependent processes, such as through death
receptor induction (8). Given this role of JNK, the ability of MKP1 to decrease JNK activation could be antiapoptotic. Indeed, in
prostate cancer, MKP-1 expression was inversely related to apoptosis (9), and expression of MKP-1 conferred resistance to Fasmediated apoptosis (10). In addition, conditional MKP-1 expression
protected leukemia cells from UV-induced apoptosis (11), mediated
the antiapoptotic effects of retinoids (12), and MKP-1 inhibition
potentiated tumor necrosis factor-a–induced apoptosis in mesangial cells (13).
Studies have shown that MKP-1 is overexpressed by up to 5-fold
or more (14) in primary samples from patients with breast
malignancies. Such overexpression occurs in up to 80% or more of
breast neoplasms ranging from carcinoma in situ to metastatic
carcinoma (15, 16). In addition, MKP-1 can be further induced by
genotoxic stress, such as radiation and alkylating agents (2), as well
as by newer agents such as proteasome inhibitors (17). Induction of
MKP-1 in response to stress is mediated in part through the p38
MAPK pathway (18), which itself is overexpressed and activated in
breast cancer (14). Notably, p38 activation was found to be a poor
prognostic sign in patients with lymph node–positive breast cancer
(19). MKP-1 has also been identified as a putative mediator of
glucocorticoid-induced survival signaling in breast cancer (20, 21).
However, the significance of these findings to breast cancer therapy
have not been established, nor has the potential to induce
chemosensitization by targeting MKP-1 directly, or through p38
MAPK.
We previously reported that MKP-1 was induced by proteasome inhibitors (17) and played an antiapoptotic role through
effects on JNK (22). This prompted us to extend our studies to
chemotherapeutic agents that were clinically relevant to breast
malignancies, including alkylating agents, anthracyclines, and
taxanes. Stable and transient MKP-1 overexpression inhibited the
ability of drugs in these classes to induce apoptosis in association with decreased JNK activation. In contrast, MKP-1 suppression with a small interfering RNA (siRNA), or targeted deletion,
enhanced chemosensitivity and JNK activity. Pharmacologic
MKP-1 inhibition through the use of a p38 MAPK inhibitor or
doxorubicin enhanced alkylkating agent–mediated apoptosis,
and this was abolished by forced MKP-1 overexpression. Taken
together, these studies support the hypothesis that MKP-1 is a
significant mediator of both de novo and inducible breast cancer chemoresistance. Furthermore, they suggest that strategies

targeting MKP-1, such as through p38 inhibition, may prove fruitful in overcoming chemoresistance and inducing chemosensitization.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Phosphatase inhibitors deltamethrin and nodularin were
from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., whereas sodium orthovanadate was
from Sigma Chemical Co. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was from
Fisher Scientific. The p38 MAPK inhibitor SD-282 (23) was from Scios, Inc.
Stock solutions were prepared in DMSO (SD-282 and phosphatase inhibitors; Fisher Scientific), 100% ethanol (PMSF; Mallinckrodt Baker, Inc.), or
PBS (sodium orthovanadate). These reagents were used at concentrations
indicated in the text, with a final vehicle concentration no >0.5%. All other
chemicals were obtained from Fisher Scientific.
Cell lines and cell culture. A1N4-myc human mammary epithelial cells
transformed by c-myc (24), and BT-474 (25) and MDA-MB-231 (26) carcinoma cells served as human breast cancer models. Preparation of MDAMB-231 cells overexpressing MKP-1, or vector-bearing controls, was
described previously (22), as was the cloning of BT-474 cells expressing
an siRNA targeting MKP-1 (siMKP), or a scrambled sequence control
(ssMKP; ref. 27). Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) from homozygous MKP-1
knockout mice (28), and wild-type controls, were from the Bristol Myers
Squibb Research Institute. All cells were propagated in incubators providing a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 (17, 22, 27, 29).
Adenovirus-mediated expression. Recombinant adenoviral plasmids
expressing MKP-1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP), or GFP alone as a
control, were constructed using the pAdEasy vector system (Stratagene;
ref. 22). For adenoviral infections, cell lines were plated at 0.5  103 cells per

well in 96-well plates for apoptosis assays, or at 1  105 cells per well in
24-well plates for Western blotting. Cells were allowed to recover overnight
and exposed to viral particles using a multiplicity to yield 80% to 100%
infection, based on GFP expression evaluated by immunofluorescence
microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss Optical, Inc.).
Treatments of interest were applied 24 h later under conditions detailed in
the text. For expression of dominant negative c-Jun (dn-c-Jun), adenovirus
expressing GFP as a control, or dn-c-Jun, was obtained from Vector BioLabs.
Cells were exposed to a multiplicity of infection of 75 for either viral
preparation, and the further manipulations described were done 24 h later.
Western blotting. Total cellular extracts were prepared in lysis buffer
containing PBS, SDS, deoxycholate, and NP40 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and subjected to Western blotting (22). JNK activation
status was determined using rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing
active, dually phosphorylated (Thr183/Tyr185) p54/46 JNK (Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.). Total JNK levels were evaluated using rabbit polyclonal
JNK antibody recognizing p46 JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit
polyclonal C-19 antibody to MKP-1 was used to assess MKP-1 levels (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). As a loading control in addition to JNK, a rat monoclonal antibody recognizing heat shock cognate protein (HSC)-70 was used
(StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.). To quantify protein bands, autoradiographs were scanned with an Agfa Duoscan T2500 scanner (Agfa Corp.) into
Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc.), and densitometry was done
using NIH Image version 1.61.
Apoptosis assays. Programmed cell death was evaluated as described
(22) using the apoptosis-specific Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit
(Roche Applied Science). As a confirmatory assay in some cases, caspase
activation was evaluated using the Apo-ONE Homogeneous Caspase-3/7
Assay kit (Promega Corporation). Additionally, cell proliferation and

1 Amol/L doxorubicin (dox ), 10 Amol/L

above. Apoptosis was evaluated with an assay
detecting oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation
and expressed in relation to vehicle-treated
controls, which were arbitrarily set at 1.0 (top ).

carcinoma cells were infected with adenoviral
constructs, treated as described above, and then

viability were assessed by measuring mitochondrial-dependent cleavage of
the tetrazolium salt WST-1 (Roche Applied Science).
Statistical analyses. Paired, two-tailed t tests were done to determine
the statistical significance of the data obtained using Prism software
(version 2.0; GraphPad Software). Findings were considered significant if
P values were <0.05.

Results
Effect of MKP-1 overexpression on chemotherapy-mediated
apoptosis. To examine the influence of MKP-1 on chemotherapyinduced cell death in breast carcinoma models, MDA-MB-231 cells
were stably transfected with pcDNA3-MKP-1, resulting in a 2-fold
increase in MKP-1 (Supplementary Fig. S1A) compared with
pcDNA3 controls. These cells were treated with the anthracycline
doxorubicin, the alkylating agent mechlorethamine, or the microtubule inhibitor paclitaxel, and assayed for apoptosis. Mechlorethamine was used rather than cyclophosphamide because, although
the latter is more clinically relevant, it must be transformed in vivo
to the active metabolite 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (30), and
cannot be used in vitro. All three chemotherapeutics induced
apoptosis, as measured by enhanced caspase-3/7 activity, in both
cell lines (Fig. 1A, left). This enhancement was consistently greater,
however, in the control MDA-MB-231/pcDNA3 cells, which did not
overexpress MKP-1. In the case of mechlorethamine, for example,
this alkylator induced 5.9-fold more caspase activity in MDA-MB231/pcDNA3 cells, but only 2.6-fold more in MDA-MB-231/
pcDNA3-MKP-1 cells (P < 0.01).
MDA-MB-231–based cell lines overexpressed MKP-1 but this
level tended to decrease with propagation, and similar findings
were noted in other cells. Therefore, an adenoviral-based expression system was used, allowing MKP-1 overexpression by up to
5-fold or more (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Doxorubicin, mechlorethamine, and paclitaxel induced caspase-3/7 activity in MDA-MB-231
cells infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-MKP/GFP (Fig. 1A, right), but this
caspase activation was blunted by MKP-1. Paclitaxel, for example,
enhanced caspase-3/7 activity by 4.3-fold in MDA-MB-231/Ad-GFP
cells, but by only 2.3-fold in MDA-MB-231/Ad-MKP/GFP cells
(P < 0.01).
It was of interest to confirm this antiapoptotic role of MKP-1 in
other models and to use other means to quantify programmed cell
death. To this end, A1N4-myc and BT-474 cells were infected with
Ad-MKP/GFP or Ad-GFP and treated as described above. Exposure
of A1N4-myc/Ad-MKP/GFP cells to chemotherapeutics enhanced
apoptosis, as measured by the generation of oligonucleosomal DNA
fragmentation, by an average of 2.2-fold above vehicle-treated
controls (Fig. 1B, top). Overexpression of GFP alone, however,
allowed these drugs to induce programmed cell death to a greater
extent, with an average 5.4-fold increase. This was accompanied by
a preservation of viability in the Ad-MKP/GFP–infected cells
compared with their Ad-GFP counterparts (Fig. 1B, bottom).
Chemotherapeutic treatments resulted in an average 22% decline
of viability in A1N4-myc/Ad-GFP cells, but only 2% in A1N4-myc/
Ad-MKP/GFP cells. Similar results were obtained with BT-474 cells,
where apoptotic induction was blunted (Fig. 1C, top), and viability
was preserved to a greater extent (Fig. 1C, bottom) by Ad-MKP/
GFP. These findings supported the hypothesis that MKP-1 overexpression protected breast carcinoma cells from chemotherapymediated apoptosis.
Overexpression of MKP-1 and chemotherapy-mediated JNK
activation. Several classes of chemotherapeutics, including anthracyclines (31, 32), alkylating agents (33), and taxanes (34–36), induce

www.aacrjournals.org

apoptosis in part through JNK activation. To determine the effect of
these chemotherapeutics, and of MKP-1, on JNK, Western blotting was used to detect activated, dually phosphorylated JNK.
Doxorubicin, mechlorethamine, and paclitaxel induced JNK
activation in A1N4-myc, BT-474, and MDA-MB-231 cells infected
with Ad-GFP (Fig. 2A). Overexpression of both GFP and MKP-1,
however, dramatically blunted the ability of these drugs to enhance
JNK activity. For example, in A1N4-myc cells, the anthracycline,
alkylator, and microtubule inhibitor increased phosphorylated
(phospho-)JNK levels by 3.5-, 4.7-, and 1.6-fold more, respectively,
in Ad-GFP–infected cells compared with Ad-MKP/GFP cells. To
verify that this JNK repression played a role in suppressing

Figure 2. MKP-1 expression represses JNK activity. A, A1N4-myc , BT-474,
and MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with Ad-GFP (GFP ) or Ad-MKP/GFP
(MKP ), and then treated with 5 Amol/L doxorubicin, 10 Amol/L mechlorethamine,
or 500 nmol/L paclitaxel for 4 h. Extracts were then analyzed for phospho-JNK
content by Western blotting using a phosphospecific JNK antibody recognizing
activated, dually phosphorylated JNK-1 and JNK-2. The blots were then stripped
and reprobed for total JNK-1 content, and the fold increase in phospho-JNK
content is expressed for each condition relative to vehicle-treated control cells,
which were arbitrarily set at 1.0, after correction for equal JNK loading. Finally,
the abundance of corrected phospho-JNK was expressed in GFP-infected
cells compared with those infected with Ad-GFP/MKP-1. Therefore, in the
example of A1N4-myc , the value ‘‘3.5’’ indicates that A1N4-myc /Ad-GFP cells
contain a 3.5-fold increased level of phospho-JNK compared with A1N4-myc /
Ad-GFP/MKP-1 cells when both have been corrected for loading. Each panel is a
representative result from one of two independent experiments. B, A1N4-myc
cells were infected with either Ad-GFP or Ad-dn-c-Jun, and treated 24 h later with
1 Amol/L doxorubicin, 10 Amol/L mechlorethamine, or 100 nmol/L paclitaxel for
18 h. Apoptosis was evaluated with an assay detecting oligonucleosomal DNA
fragmentation and expressed in relation to vehicle-treated controls, which were
arbitrarily set at 1.0. Columns, mean from four independent experiments; bars,

chemotherapy-mediated apoptosis, A1N4-myc cells were infected
with Ad-GFP or with Ad-dn-c-Jun (37). When these cells were
treated with doxorubicin, mechlorethamine, or paclitaxel (Fig. 2B),
apoptosis-associated DNA fragmentation was induced in A1N4myc/Ad-GFP cells. However, suppression of just one of the downstream effectors of JNK, c-Jun, decreased programmed cell death

induced by these chemotherapeutics. These studies documented
that MKP-1 overexpression and suppression of apoptosis was
associated with blunted JNK activity and that this change played a
role in modulating the levels of programmed cell death.
Genetic suppression of MKP-1 and chemotherapy-mediated
apoptosis. If MKP-1 plays an antiapoptotic role, then inhibiting
its expression should enhance chemosensitivity. To evaluate this
possibility, genetic approaches were studied, including the use of an
siRNA and targeted gene disruption. BT-474 cells stably expressing
ssMKP, a control siRNA that does not target any known genes
(22, 27), were treated with doxorubicin, mechlorethamine, or
paclitaxel, all of which induced apoptosis (Fig. 3A). In BT-474 cells
stably expressing siMKP, however, which suppressed MKP-1 expression (refs. 22, 27; Supplementary Fig. S1C), the extent of apoptosis
was significantly enhanced, by an average of 2.2-fold. Although
siMKP decreased MKP-1 levels, it did not abolish them; thus, we
sought to study the effect of complete MKP-1 abrogation, such as
might be possible in the future with a direct pharmacologic MKP-1
antagonist. MEFs from MKP-1 knockout (MKP / ) mice, in which
both MKP-1 alleles were disrupted (28), were therefore compared
with wild-type (MKP+/+) controls. Doxorubicin, mechlorethamine,
or paclitaxel induced apoptosis in MKP+/+ controls (Fig. 3B); however, MKP / cells were dramatically more sensitive. Treatment
with doxorubicin, for example, resulted in a 12-fold increase of
apoptosis in MKP / MEFs relative to wild-type controls, whereas
for mechlorethamine there was a 10-fold difference. These studies
supported the possibility that targeting MKP-1 represents a rational
means of overcoming chemoresistance in breast malignancies.
Suppression of MKP-1 and JNK activation status. To further
validate the hypothesis that MKP-1 was influencing chemotherapyinduced apoptosis through JNK, BT-474/siMKP, BT-474/ssMKP, and
MKP+/+ and MKP / MEFs treated as above were analyzed by
Western blotting. Doxorubicin, mechlorethamine, and paclitaxel
enhanced the abundance of activated, dually phospho-JNK-1/2
(Fig. 4A), by 2.0-, 30.7-, and 3.5-fold, respectively, in BT-474/ssMKP
cells. In BT-474/siMKP cells, however, these agents induced
enhanced levels of JNK activity, as reflected by a 4.4-, 144.0-, and
4.9-fold increase, respectively, in phosphorylated JNK-1/2. In the
MEF model system, the three chemotherapeutics induced a modest
increase in phospho-JNK in wild-type MKP+/+ cells (Fig. 4B).
Targeted MKP-1 disruption enhanced the sensitivity of JNK to

equivalent loading of the JNK-1 control. Each panel

independent experiments. B, MKP-1 (+/+) and

activation by anthracyclines, alkylating agents, and microtubule
inhibitors, in association with the increased apoptotic susceptibility of these cells (Fig. 3).
Impact of p38 MAPK inhibition on MKP-1 and apoptosis. In
addition to the basal overexpression of MKP-1 seen in breast
tumors, further MKP-1 induction occurs in response to genotoxic
stressors, such as alkylating agents and proteasome inhibitors, in
part through activation of p38 MAPK (18, 38, 39). Because clinically
relevant direct pharmacologic MKP-1 inhibitors are not yet
available, we considered the possibility that targeting p38 could
serve to enhance chemosensitivity. BT-474 cells treated with

Figure 5. p38 inhibition suppresses MKP-1 and augments alkylating agent–
mediated apoptosis. A, BT-474 cells without any prior transfection or infection
were preincubated with vehicle or 0.1 Amol/L of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SD-282,
and then treated further with either vehicle or 10 Amol/L mechlorethamine for
18 h. The content of phospho-JNK, JNK, MKP-1, and HSC-70 was then analyzed
by Western blotting, and adjusted for loading and expressed as indicated
previously. This panel is a representative result from one of two independent
experiments. B, programmed cell death induced in BT-474 cells treated as

fragmentation. Results are expressed as a fold increase over vehicle-treated

mechlorethamine underwent programmed cell death in association
with JNK activation, but this alkylator also substantially induced
MKP-1 (Fig. 5A). Pretreatment with the p38 inhibitor SD-282
decreased mechlorethamine-mediated MKP-1 induction from
15.0- to 2.4-fold above controls. This was associated with a
superinduction of JNK, with phospho-JNK levels increasing from
14.7- to 59.5-fold above vehicle-treated controls. To evaluate if
this pharmacologic manipulation resulted in enhanced alkylating
agent-mediated apoptosis, BT-474 cells were treated with mechlorethamine in the presence or absence of the p38 MAPK inhibitor
(Fig. 5B). When MKP-1 was overexpressed to high levels due to
p38 activation (Fig. 5A), mechlorethamine activated programmed
cell death. However, when mechlorethamine-mediated MKP-1
induction was blunted with SD-282, higher levels of apoptosis
were induced (P < 0.05).
Interaction between anthracyclines and alkylators at the
level of MKP-1. We previously reported that anthracyclines,
including doxorubicin and epirubicin, specifically suppressed
MKP-1 transcription by a direct effect on its promoter (27). The
above results with p38 inhibitors suggested, therefore, that the
known clinical efficacy of the anthracycline/alkylating agent
regimen against breast cancer might be due to its effect on
MKP-1. To test this, A1N4-myc cells were infected with Ad-GFP or
Ad-MKP/GFP, and then treated with vehicle, doxorubicin, mechlorethamine, or both. Lower MKP-1 levels were induced in these
experiments because a lower multiplicity of infection with
adenovirus vectors was used. This was necessary to allow for the
detection of the higher levels of apoptosis anticipated due to the
application of two antineoplastic agents as opposed to one, as well
as the effect of adenoviral infection itself, within the linear range of
the assay in use. A1N4-myc/Ad-GFP cells treated with the
combination showed a reduction in MKP-1 compared with cells
treated with the alkylator alone (Fig. 6A, left), and this was
associated with enhanced phospho-JNK induction (Fig. 6A, left).
Programmed cell death (Fig. 6B, left) was induced by the
combination to a greater extent than a simple sum of the two
agents, indicating the likely presence of synergy. In A1N4-myc/AdMKP/GFP cells, however, MKP-1 overexpression blunted JNK
activation by the alkylating agent/anthracycline regimen (Fig. 6A,
left). Notably, in the presence of higher levels of irrepressible MKP1, this combination regimen was less active in inducing enhanced
levels of programmed cell death in comparison with control, GFPexpressing counterparts (Fig. 6B, left). Under these conditions,
mechlorethamine and doxorubicin had only an additive effect.
To confirm these findings, we studied BT-474 cells, and found that
BT-474/Ad-GFP cells treated with the combination showed a
reduction in MKP-1 compared with cells treated with the alkylating
agent alone (Fig. 6A, right). This was associated with enhanced
phospho-JNK induction (Fig. 6A, right), and levels of programmed
cell death that were greater than the sum of the effect of each
agent alone (Fig. 6B, right), supporting the presence of synergy.
In BT-474/Ad-MKP/GFP cells, however, MKP-1 overexpression
blunted JNK induction by the alkylating agent/anthracycline
regimen (Fig. 6A, right). Importantly, in the presence of higher
levels of irrepressible MKP-1, this combination regimen no longer
induced apoptosis at levels higher than that achieved by either
agent alone (Fig. 6B, right), supporting the presence of antagonism.
These findings strongly support the hypothesis that MKP-1
suppression by anthracyclines or p38 MAPK inhibitors is a rational
approach to chemosensitization to agents such as alkylators that
further induce MKP-1 levels.

Figure 6. MKP-1 suppression plays a role in the activity of a doxorubicin/alkylator regimen. A, A1N4-myc (left ) and BT-474 cells (right ) were infected with Ad-GFP
(GFP ) or Ad-MKP/GFP (MKP ), and then treated as previously described either with vehicle, 5 Amol/L doxorubicin, 5 Amol/L mechlorethamine, or the combination.
Extracts were then analyzed for phospho-JNK, JNK-1, MKP-1, and HSC-70 levels by Western blotting. The relative change in phospho-JNK and MKP-1 levels is shown
relative to the untreated Ad-GFP control sample, which was arbitrarily set at 1.0, after adjustment for either total JNK-1 content for phospho-JNK analysis, or total
HSC-70 for MKP-1 analysis. Representative data are from one of two independent experiments. Please note that lower MKP-1 levels were induced in these experiments
compared with those in Fig. 1 because a lower multiplicity of infection with adenovirus vectors was used. This was necessary to allow for the detection of the
higher levels of apoptosis anticipated due to the application of two antineoplastic agents as opposed to one, as well as the effect of adenoviral infection itself, within
the linear range of the assay in use. Similarly, a lower dose of mechlorethamine was applied to allow the increased levels of apoptosis anticipated with exposure
to two drugs, as opposed to only one, to still be captured in the linear range of the assay in use. B, A1N4-myc (left ; n = 4) and BT-474 cells (right ; n = 6) infected
with Ad-GFP or Ad-MKP/GFP were treated with vehicle, 1 Amol/L doxorubicin, 5 Amol/L mechlorethamine, or the combination, and the induced apoptosis was evaluated
using a DNA fragmentation ELISA. Results are expressed as a fold increase over vehicle-treated Ad-GFP–infected cells, which were arbitrarily set at 1.0.

Discussion
Chemotherapeutic agents can be limited in their ability to
induce beneficial antitumor effects by chemoresistance, which can
occur in de novo or inducible forms. One example of a pathway
that contributes to both is the nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), which is
activated at baseline in many cancers, including some breast
malignancies, and can be further induced by genotoxic stressors,
such as chemotherapeutics (40). Downstream consequences of
NF-nB activation include the induction of survival-promoting
Bcl-2 and inhibitor of apoptosis protein families that mediate
chemoresistance. Strategies that block NF-nB activity, including
overexpression of the inhibitory protein InB, or its stabilization
through proteasome inhibition that blocks InB degradation (41),
have been proven to overcome chemoresistance and to induce
chemosensitization.
Our current results support the possibility that MKP-1 is an
important mediator of de novo breast cancer chemoresistance
because its overexpression to levels comparable with those in
clinical samples inhibited the proapoptotic activity of an
anthracycline, an alkylating agent, and a microtubule inhibitor
(Fig. 1). This is in agreement with recent reports that MKP-1 may
play a role in the glucocorticoid-mediated resistance seen in MCF-7
breast carcinoma cells in response to paclitaxel and doxorubicin
(20, 21). Moreover, siRNA-mediated MKP-1 inhibition, or its complete abolition by targeted disruption, significantly enhanced the

proapoptotic activity of these drugs (Fig. 3) that have clinical
relevance to breast cancer in a number of settings, including adjuvant therapy (42). Mechanistic studies suggested that this effect
of MKP-1 was mediated, at least in part, through its ability to
modulate the activation of JNK. Overexpression of MKP-1, which
inhibited apoptosis, was associated with decreased JNK activity
(Fig. 2), whereas MKP-1 inhibition, which augmented apoptosis,
resulted in enhanced phospho-JNK levels (Fig. 4), reflective of
increased JNK activity. Also, inhibition of c-Jun, one of the downstream JNK mediators, inhibited chemotherapy-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 2), further validating the link between MKP-1, JNK, and
programmed cell death.
Clinically relevant, direct MKP-1 inhibitors have not yet been
developed; however, the current study suggests that they could be
applicable to breast cancer, where up to 80% or more of primary
samples overexpress this phosphatase (15, 16). It should be noted
that MKP-1 is overexpressed in other malignancies as well, such as
prostate cancer (9, 10, 16, 43). Given the early evidence of an
inverse relationship between MKP-1 and apoptosis in prostate
cancer (9), it is tempting to speculate that MKP-1 may mediate
de novo chemoresistance in that malignancy. Our studies therefore
provide an impetus for further preclinical development and clinical
translation of direct MKP-1 inhibitors to overcome de novo
chemoresistance. In that regard, recent results from Vogt et al.
(44) and Lazo et al. (45), describing the identification of novel

agents that specifically inhibit MKP-1 in vitro at micromolar
concentrations, are encouraging, and suggest that it may be possible to develop even more potent, clinically applicable inhibitors.
MKP-1 is part of the stress response pathway and can be induced
further by chemotherapeutics such as alkylating agents in a p38
MAPK-dependent process (18). Given the prominent role of
alkylators in breast cancer therapy, we studied the effect of combinations with a p38 inhibitor and an anthracycline, which both
suppress MKP-1. Regimens incorporating either an alkylating
agent and a p38 inhibitor (Fig. 5), or an alkylator and doxorubicin
(Fig. 6), resulted in enhanced proapoptotic activity, suppression of
MKP-1, and enhanced JNK activation. Moreover, forced overexpression of MKP-1 suppressed the ability of the anthracycline/
alkylating agent regimen to induce greater levels of programmed
cell death, supporting the importance of inhibition of MKP-1
expression in this process.
These results suggest that the clinical relevance of alkylator/
anthracycline regimens, which for many years were standards of
care for adjuvant breast cancer therapy (42), may be due in part to
doxorubicin-mediated suppression of cyclophosphamide-induced
MKP-1. They also suggest that incorporation of p38 MAPK
inhibitors, some of which are currently in clinical trials (46), may
be a rational approach to chemosensitization to alkylating agents
either in addition to, or in place of, doxorubicin. The latter
approach has the potential of reducing the anthracycline-mediated

cardiac toxicity associated with breast cancer chemotherapy (47).
Moreover, inhibition of p38 may have other beneficial effects, such
as suppression of P-glycoprotein (48), of activation of heat shock
protein-27 (49), and of the AKT8 virus oncogene cellular
homologue/protein kinase B (50), all of which may play roles in
chemoresistance. It is also tempting to speculate that p38 MAPK
activation, which is seen in a large proportion of breast neoplasms
(14), and in some studies has portended a poor clinical prognosis
(19), may have its effect through MKP-1–mediated chemoresistance.
Taken together, these studies strongly implicate MKP-1 as an
important mediator of de novo and inducible chemoresistance.
Approaches to inhibit MKP-1, such as through the development of
pharmacologic agents that directly block its phosphatase activity,
or through the use of p38 MAPK inhibitors that act indirectly by
blocking its transcription, therefore merit further investigation as
potential mechanisms to induce chemosensitization and overcome
breast cancer chemoresistance.
