Abstract

Author Manuscript

Biotin-dependent carboxylases are widely distributed in nature and have important functions in the
metabolism of fatty acids, amino acids, carbohydrates, cholesterol and other compounds 1–6.
Defective mutations in several of these enzymes have been linked to serious metabolic diseases in
humans, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is a target for drug discovery against diabetes, cancer
and other diseases 7–9. We report here the identification and biochemical, structural and functional
characterizations of a novel single-chain (120 kD), multi-domain biotin-dependent carboxylase in
bacteria. It has preference for long-chain acyl-CoA substrates, although it is also active toward
short- and medium-chain acyl-CoAs, and we have named it long-chain acyl-CoA carboxylase
(LCC). The holoenzyme is a homo-hexamer with molecular weight of 720 kD. The 3.0 Å crystal
structure of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis LCC (MapLCC) holoenzyme
revealed an architecture that is strikingly different compared to those of related biotin-dependent
carboxylases 10,11. In addition, the domains of each monomer have no direct contacts with each
other. They are instead extensively swapped in the holoenzyme, such that one cycle of catalysis
involves the participation of four monomers. Functional studies in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
suggest that the enzyme is involved in the utilization of selected carbon and nitrogen sources.

The reactions catalyzed by biotin-dependent carboxylases proceed in two steps and involve
at least three different protein components (Extended Data Fig. 1). In the first step, a biotin
carboxylase (BC) component catalyzes the carboxylation of the biotin cofactor, which is
covalently linked to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) component. In the second

step, the carboxylated biotin translocates to the carboxyltransferase (CT) active site and
transfers the carboxyl group to the substrate. In bacteria, ACC has been well characterized
as a multi-subunit enzyme, with a BC subunit, a BCCP subunit, and two subunits (α and β)
for the CT activity (Extended Data Fig. 1). In contrast, ACC is a large (~250 kD), singlechain, multi-domain enzyme in most eukaryotes (Extended Data Fig. 1), with domains that
are homologous to the bacterial subunits. Other members of this family include propionylCoA carboxylase (PCC) 10, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) 11, pyruvate
carboxylase (PC) 12,13, and urea carboxylase (UC) 14 (Extended Data Fig. 1).

Author Manuscript

By examining the sequence database, we identified a novel single-chain (~120 kD), multidomain biotin-dependent carboxylase in bacteria 1. The enzyme contains a BC domain at the
N terminus, a BCCP domain near the middle, and a CT domain that is homologous to that of
ACC and PCC (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1). Homologs of this enzyme are found in a
large number of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, such as Rhodopseudomonas
palustris, Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis 15, and the human pathogen
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Extended Data Fig. 2), with highly conserved sequences
(Extended Data Fig. 3). These homologs are in fact mis-annotated as PC 16 or carbamoylphosphate synthase (CPS) in the database, as was noted in an earlier report 17, probably
because they have approximately the same size as PC and CPS. The CT domain of PC has a
completely different sequence and structure 12,13 (Extended Data Fig. 1), whereas CPS is
not a biotin-dependent enzyme and does not have a BCCP domain. These single-chain
enzymes are somewhat related to a family of acyl-CoA carboxylases that have been
characterized in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other actinomycetes 3, where BC and
BCCP are present in one subunit while CT is in a separate subunit (Extended Data Fig. 1,
see below).

Author Manuscript

We over-expressed several of these single-chain enzymes in E. coli and purified them to
homogeneity. The proteins migrated at the same position on a gel filtration column as the
750 kD α6β6 holoenzymes of PCC 10 and MCC 11, suggesting that these enzymes are
hexamers, with a molecular weight of ~720 kD for the holoenzyme.

Author Manuscript

We characterized the catalytic activities of the enzyme from R. palustris, which is annotated
as both PC and CPS in the database. Consistent with the sequence analysis, we found that
this enzyme is an acyl-CoA carboxylase, and we did not observe any PC activity for it. The
enzyme is active toward all the acyl-CoAs that we tested, with chain lengths from C2 to
C16, but it prefers long-chain substrates (Extended Data Table 1). The kcat values for all the
substrates are comparable, while the Km for palmitoyl-CoA is ~350-fold lower than that for
acetyl-CoA. The high sequence conservation among these proteins (Extended Data Fig. 3)
suggests that they have similar activity profiles. Therefore, we have named them long-chain
acyl-CoA carboxylases (LCCs). Broad-spectrum activity has been observed for a few of the
acyl-CoA carboxylases in actinomycetes 3,18.
To define the holoenzyme architecture, we determined the crystal structure at 3.0 Å
resolution of M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis LCC (MapLCC, Figs. 1b–1e), which
shares 52% amino acid sequence identity with R. palustris LCC (Extended Data Fig. 3). The
holoenzyme hexamer is situated on a crystallographic three-fold axis, and there is a dimer in

the asymmetric unit. The atomic model has good agreement with the crystallographic data
and the expected geometric parameters (Extended Data Table 2). Several segments of the
protein have poor or no electron density and are not included in the atomic model. These
include parts of the linkers from the BCCP to the BC and CT domains (Fig. 1b), although
there is no ambiguity in assigning the BCCP domain to a specific monomer. A different
assignment will result in gaps that are too large to be bridged by the missing residues.
The overall structures of the two MapLCC monomers in the asymmetric unit are similar.
With their CT domains superposed, a difference of 3° is seen in the orientation of their BC
domains (Fig. 1b). The BCCP domains have a larger difference, corresponding to a rotation
of 15°, indicating some asymmetry in the holoenzyme hexamer. Remarkably, the BC,
BCCP, and CT domains of each monomer do not have any direct contacts with each other.

Author Manuscript

The structure of the holoenzyme hexamer of MapLCC has the shape of an equilateral
triangle, obeying 32 symmetry and with a length of ~180 Å for each side (Fig. 1c) and a
thickness of ~65 Å (Figs. 1d, 1e). A hexamer of the CT domain forms the central core of the
structure, with three CT domains in each layer and CT dimers being formed by one domain
from each layer. Dimeric BC domains are located at the vertices of the triangle, contacting
CT domain dimers. The BCCP domains are situated between the BC and CT domains but
not in the active site of either domain. The lysine residue that would be biotinylated is
located on the surface, more than 15 Å away from the nearest BC or CT domain, and its side
chain is disordered. The BCCP domain is not biotinylated in this holoenzyme, even though
it was expressed under identical conditions as those for R. palustris LCC, which was
completely biotinylated.

Author Manuscript

The overall architecture of the MapLCC holoenzyme is strikingly different from those of
PCC (Fig. 1f) 10 and MCC (Fig. 1g) 11, even though all three enzymes are ~750 kD
oligomers made up of homologous BC, CT and BCCP domains. The central CT domain
core of MapLCC is similar to that of the β6 hexamer core of PCC, with an rms distance of
1.7 Å for 2,073 equivalent Cα atoms between them (Extended Data Fig. 4). In contrast,
while the BC domains are located above and below the central core in PCC and MCC, they
are positioned at the side of the central core in MapLCC. Moreover, the BC domain is a
monomer in PCC and a weakly associated trimer in MCC, but it is a dimer in MapLCC. In
fact, this dimer is similar to that for the BC subunit of E. coli ACC 19,20 (Extended Data Fig.
4) and the BC domain of PC 12,13.

Author Manuscript

A BT domain was identified in the structures of PCC (Fig. 1f) and MCC (Fig. 1g), located
between the BC and BCCP domains in the primary sequence (Extended Data Fig. 1) and
having an important role in mediating interactions between their α (BC) and β (CT)
subunits 10,11. This domain does not exist in LCC, as there are not sufficient residues in the
linker between BC and BCCP to form such a domain (Extended Data Fig. 1). On the other
hand, the BC-BCCP linker and the BCCP-CT linker do participate in mediating interactions
in the MapLCC holoenzyme, and there are also direct contacts between the BC and CT
domains (see below).

The domains of the MapLCC monomers are swapped extensively in the holoenzyme
hexamer. The CT domains of two monomers related by a BC domain dimer are located far
from each other (Fig. 2a). Similarly, the BC domains of two monomers related by a CT
domain dimer are also located far from each other (Fig. 2b). Therefore, interactions among
these domains occur only in the context of the holoenzyme, and the structure of the
monomer alone is unlikely to be stable (Fig. 1b).

Author Manuscript

A total of ~8,200 Å2 of the surface area of each MapLCC monomer is buried in the
holoenzyme. The majority of this surface, 5,700 Å2, is buried by the interface among the CT
domains in the central core, and 1,000 Å2 surface is buried in the BC dimer interface (Figs.
3a,3b). The remaining interfaces in the holoenzyme make smaller contributions to the
surface area burial, 600 Å2 in the BC-CT interface, 500 Å2 for the linkers from BCCP, and
400 Å2 from the BCCP domain. Nonetheless, all of these smaller interfaces together may be
important for stabilizing the holoenzyme.
The primary BC-CT interface involves three monomers of MapLCC. A β-hairpin structure
in the BC domain of monomer 4 contacts the CT domains of monomer 2 (N domain) and
monomer 6 (C domain, Fig. 3c). Similarly, the BC-BCCP linker just prior to the BCCP
domain in monomer 1 contacts the CT domain of monomer 2 and the BC domain of
monomer 4 (Fig. 3d). These interactions also demonstrate the extensive connections among
the monomers in the holoenzyme. The interfaces involve van der Waals contacts, hydrogen
bonding and ionic interactions.

Author Manuscript

We also carried out electron microscopy (EM) studies on the MapLCC holoenzyme.
Negative-stain EM images showed mono-dispersed particles of similar size but variable
shapes (Extended Data Fig. 5). Classification in SPARX 21 of ~25,000 particles yielded 308
classes that represented 65% of the data set (Extended Data Fig. 5). Cross-correlation
analysis identified class averages that are very similar to the top view (cross-correlation
coefficient of 0.856, Fig. 3e) and side view (cross-correlation coefficient of 0.752, Fig. 3f)
of the crystal structure, confirming the holoenzyme architecture seen in the crystal. At the
same time, substantial variations in the three peripheral densities (corresponding to the BC
domains) relative to the central core (the CT domains) are also observed (Extended Data
Fig. 5). Each peripheral density can appear as a single or bilobed feature (Fig. 3g), likely
representing different views of the BC dimer. The densities can also be located in different
positions relative to the central core, breaking the alignment of the two-fold axes of the BC
and CT dimers (Fig. 3h). Overall, the EM data indicate that the peripheral BC domains
move as dimers and are flexibly tethered to the CT core (Supplementary video S1),
consistent with the crystal structure that the BC-CT contact is relatively weak in MapLCC.

Author Manuscript

Each BC active site is located ~40 Å from a CT active site in the MapLCC holoenzyme
(Fig. 4a). The BCCP domain, while not located in either active site, can readily access both
of them, through conformational changes in its linkers. Remarkably, the crystal structure
shows that the BCCP domain of monomer 1 visits the BC active site of monomer 4 and the
CT active site at the interface of monomers 2 and 6 (Fig. 4a), suggesting that each cycle of
catalysis requires the participation of 4 monomers. This again indicates the extensive
communications among the monomers in this holoenzyme. The residues in both active sites

are generally conserved with those in other biotin-dependent carboxylases, suggesting a
similar catalytic mechanism 22 for LCC. The CT active site has a pocket that can
accommodate short- and medium-chain acyl groups (Extended Data Fig. 6), and a
conformational change is needed to bind long-chain substrates. This conformational
flexibility may be important for the enzyme to adapt to and be active toward the broad
collection of substrates.

Author Manuscript

In most of the other biotin-dependent carboxylases, BCCP is located at the end of a
polypeptide chain, and therefore there is only one linker to the rest of the protein. The LCCs,
and the eukaryotic ACCs (Extended Data Fig. 1), are distinct in that BCCP is located in the
middle of these proteins. Therefore, there are two linkers from BCCP to the rest of the
protein. The amino acid sequences of these two linkers in the LCC enzymes are not
conserved (Extended Data Fig. 3). Therefore, they are likely to be flexible and allow the
movement of BCCP during catalysis, consistent with the fact that a portion of both linkers is
disordered in the structure (Fig. 1b). Residues in both linkers that are included in the current
atomic model also have high B values (Extended Data Fig. 4). In addition, the B domain of
BC and a loop near the C terminus of the protein have high B values and are partially
disordered.

Author Manuscript

The structure of MapLCC also has implications for the holoenzymes of other biotindependent carboxylases, especially the family of acyl-CoA carboxylases in M. tuberculosis,
S. coelicolor and other actinomycetes 3. These enzymes contain two subunits, with BCBCCP in the α subunit and CT in the β subunit, and there are not enough residues in one of
the α subunits for a BT domain (Extended Data Fig. 1). The holoenzyme is an α6β6
dodecamer, and the structure of the β6 hexamer 23 is similar to that of the CT domain
hexamer in MapLCC. Therefore, it is likely that the holoenzymes of such two-subunit
carboxylases share a similar architecture as MapLCC (Fig. 1c) rather than PCC (Fig. 1f).
Interestingly, M. tuberculosis does not have an LCC homolog, indicating some differences
among these mycobacterial species.
Eukaryotic ACCs are also single-chain, multi-domain enzymes (Extended Data Fig. 1),
although there are substantial differences compared to LCC. The eukaryotic ACCs contain
~1000 additional residues, including a unique central region of ~700 residues, and they are
likely to carry a BT domain as well. Therefore, the overall architecture of the eukaryotic
ACCs is likely to be different from that of MapLCC observed here.

Author Manuscript

We have begun to characterize the physiological functions of LCC, using Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (strain PA14) as the model organism. The P. aeruginosa enzyme (locus name
PA14_46320, homolog of PA1400 in P. aeruginosa PAO1) shares 59% amino acid
sequence identity with R. palustris LCC. This organism also carries the multi-subunit ACC,
MCC and geranyl-CoA carboxylase (GCC) 24,25, although it lacks a homolog for PCC. The
multi-subunit ACC is likely essential, similar to the E. coli enzyme, as no transposon
insertions in its subunits are found in a PA14 transposon mutant library 26. On the other
hand, transposon insertions are found in LCC, MCC and GCC, suggesting that they are not
essential for growth under the conditions used to produce this library 26.

We produced a markerless deletion of LCC/PA14_46320, confirming that it is not essential
for cell survival. The activity profiles of the mutant under ~2000 conditions were
characterized using a phenotype microarray, which monitored its ability to reduce a
tetrazolium dye 27. The incubation conditions included different carbon or nitrogen sources,
nutrient supplements, osmolytes, pH values, and antibiotics. While most of the conditions
showed comparable profiles between the wild type and the LCC deletion mutant, phenotypic
differences were observed for several conditions (Extended Data Fig. 7), and two of these
were considered significant based on the phenotype microarray analysis – using fumarate as
the sole carbon source and the Met-Val dipeptide as the sole nitrogen source (Fig. 4b). It is
not clear how this enzyme is linked to selected carbon and nitrogen source utilization in P.
aeruginosa. The metabolism of both Met and Val is likely to produce propionyl-CoA, and
the PCC activity of LCC may be important for its further degradation, as is the case in many
other organisms. This is also supported by the fact that P. aeruginosa lacks a proper PCC
enzyme.
A long-chain acyl-CoA carboxylase activity is needed for the biosynthesis of mycolic acid
in Mycobacterium and other actinomycetes 3,18,28. However, the LCC enzyme studied here
is unlikely to be essential for this function, as its homolog is absent in M. tuberculosis.
Moreover, mycolic acid is not known to be present in P. aeruginosa, R. palustris and other
bacteria, suggesting that this LCC is likely to have different physiological functions.

Author Manuscript

The striking differences in the architectures of LCC, PCC and MCC holoenzymes are also
linked to functional differences among them. Especially, the N and C domains of the β
subunits of PCC and MCC are swapped relative to each other, and this is coupled to the
different substrate specificity of the two enzymes. PCC carboxylates the α carbon of an acid
(as a CoA ester), while MCC carboxylates the γ carbon of an α-β unsaturated acid (Extended
Data Fig. 1). Therefore, the structural differences suggest that there are two lineages of the
biotin-dependent carboxylases 11, one containing PCC, ACC and LCC, the other containing
MCC and possibly GCC. At the same time, PCC and LCC share propionyl-CoA carboxylase
activity, indicating that similar biochemical activities can be supported by holoenzymes with
dramatically different architectures as well.

Author Manuscript

Overall, our studies have identified a new member of the biotin-dependent carboxylase
family, and revealed a novel architecture for its holoenzyme. These observations are also
relevant for other members of this family. Moreover, the differences in the architectures of
LCC, PCC and MCC holoenzymes, despite their sharing domains with homologous
structures, indicate that these domains can be arranged in remarkably different ways to form
the various holoenzymes. This will have significant implications for other multi-domain
proteins, especially eukaryotic ACCs, and protein structure and sequence conservation in
general.

by PCR and cloned into pET28a, pET26b and/or pET24d vectors (Novagen). The plasmids
were transformed into BL21Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen). Protein expression was induced
with the addition of 1 mM IPTG, and the cells were grown at 16°C for 16–20 h.
To facilitate biotinylation, the recombinant enzyme was co-expressed with the E. coli biotin
ligase BirA, and 15 mg/liter biotin was added to the medium. An avidin shift assay of the
purified enzymes showed that R. palustris LCC was completely biotinylated. However,
purified MapLCC did not show any biotinylation, possibly indicating some degree of
selectivity of the BirA enzyme. Expression of P. aeruginosa LCC did not produce any
soluble protein and was not pursued further.

Author Manuscript

Cells were lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 250 mM NaCl,
5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM PMSF. Soluble enzyme was
purified by Ni-NTA (Qiagen), anion exchange, and gel filtration (Sephacryl S-300, GE
Healthcare) chromatography. The S-300 running buffer for MapLCC contained 25 mM
Hepes (pH 7.4), 250 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM dithiothreitol. The purified protein was
concentrated to 6 mg/ml, and the solution was supplemented with 5% (v/v) glycerol before
being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.
The selenomethionyl MapLCC protein was produced in B834 (DE3) cells (Novagen) that
were grown in defined LeMaster medium supplemented with selenomethionine 30. The
protein was purified with the same protocol as that for the native enzyme.
Protein crystallization

Author Manuscript

MapLCC was crystallized at 4°C using the microbatch method under paraffin oil. The
protein solution was mixed with a precipitant solution containing 0.1 M Bis-tris propane (pH
7.5–8.5), and 1.5–2.0 M ammonium sulfate. Crystals took 4–6 weeks to grow to full size,
and larger crystals were obtained by microseeding. They were cryo-protected with reservoir
solution supplemented with 12–15% (v/v) glycerol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for
data collection at 100 K. The C-terminal His-tag on the protein was not removed before
crystallization.
Data collection and structure determination
X-ray diffraction data for the native (wavelength 1.075 Å) and selenomethionyl (0.979Å)
crystals were collected using a Q315 CCD (ADSC) at the X29A beamline of the National
Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS). The diffraction images were processed with the HKL
package 31. The crystals belong to space group P213, with cell dimensions of a=b=c=220.9
Å. There are two MapLCC monomers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit.

Author Manuscript

The structure of MapLCC was solved by a combination of molecular replacement and
selenomethionyl SAD phasing. The orientation and position of the BC, CT and BCCP
domains were located with the program Phaser 32. The Se sites were located with the
program SHELX 33, and SOLVE/RESOLVE was used for phasing the reflections and
automated model building 34. The atomic model was built with the program Coot 35. The
structure refinement was carried out with the programs CNS 36. The crystallographic
information is summarized in Extended Data Table 2.

We also obtained a second crystal form of MapLCC, with an entire hexamer in the
asymmetric unit, and were able to collect an X-ray diffraction data set to 4.3 Å resolution
(space group P212121, a=102 Å, b=292 Å, and c=314 Å). The structure of this crystal form
was readily solved by the molecular replacement method, and it revealed essentially the
same holoenzyme architecture (data not shown).
Electron microscopy and image processing

Author Manuscript

Purified MapLCC was prepared by conventional negative staining with 0.75% (w/v) uranyl
formate 37. Images were collected with a Tecnai T12 electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro,
OR) equipped with an LaB6 filament and operated at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV.
Images were recorded using low-dose procedures on an UltraScan 895 4K × 4K CCD
camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA) using a defocus of −1.5 μm and a nominal magnification of
52,000x. The calibrated magnification was 70,527x, yielding a pixel size of 2.13 Å on the
specimen level.

Author Manuscript

BOXER, the display program associated with the EMAN software package 38, was used to
interactively select 24,535 particles from 270 CCD images, and the SPIDER software
package 39 was used to window the particles into 160 × 160-pixel images. To perform
iterative stable alignment and clustering (ISAC) 40 in SPARX 21, the size of the particle
images was reduced to 64 × 64 pixels, and the particles were pre-aligned and centered. ISAC
was run on the Orchestra High Performance Compute Cluster at Harvard Medical School
(http://rc.hms.harvard.edu), specifying 200 images per group and a pixel error of 0.7. After
19 generations, 308 classes were obtained, accounting for 15,932 particles (65% of the
entire data set) (Extended Data Fig. 4). Averages of these classes were calculated using the
original 160 × 160-pixel images. To confirm that the ISAC averages are representative of
the entire data set, the particles were also subjected to 10 cycles of multi-reference
alignment in SPIDER. Each round of multi-reference alignment was followed by K-means
classification, specifying 300 output classes (Extended Data Fig. 5).
To compare the class averages with the crystal structure, the crystal structure was Fourier
transformed, filtered to 30 Å with a Butterworth low-pass filter, and transformed back.
Evenly spaced projections were calculated at 4° intervals and subjected to 10 cycles of
alignment with masked EM class averages. The class averages most similar to the top and
side view of the crystal structure and their cross-correlation coefficients are presented in
(Figs. 3e, 3f).

Author Manuscript

To visualize the structural heterogeneity of MapLCC in solution, 179 averages obtained by
ISAC that showed three peripheral densities were selected (indicated by asterisks in
Extended Data Fig. 5), ordered according to their correlation coefficients, and used to
prepare Supplementary Video 1. This structural variability is likely the reason why it was
not possible to calculate a 3D map from cryo-EM images of vitrified MapLCC samples.

3.5/3.7 units lactate dehydrogenase/pyruvate kinase (Sigma), 0.25 μM enzyme (except for
MCC, which was at 1.2 μM), and varying concentrations of acyl-CoA. The absorbance at
340 nm was monitored for 1.5 min. The initial velocities were fitted to the MichaelisMenten equation using the program Origin (OriginLab).
Construction of an LCC deletion mutant in P. aeruginosa

Author Manuscript

A markerless deletion was generated for the gene PA14_46320 in P. aeruginosa PA14 using
previously described methods 42. Briefly, ~1 kb flanking regions for PA14_46320 were
amplified using primers listed in Extended Data Table 3 and recombined into the allelicreplacement vector pMQ30 through gap repair cloning in the yeast strain InvSc1 43. This
plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BW29427 and moved into PA14 using
biparental conjugation. LB agar containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin was used to select for P.
aeruginosa single recombinants. Markerless deletions in PA14_46320 (double
recombinants) were then selected using LB agar plates devoid of NaCl and containing 10%
(w/v) sucrose as a counter-selection and their genotypes were confirmed by PCR.
Phenotype microarrays
The phenotype microarray screening was carried out by Biolog, Inc. as described 27.

Structural comparisons of domains in LCC with related enzymes. (a). Stereo drawing of the
overlay of the structure of the BC domain dimer of MapLCC (in color) with that of BC
subunit dimer of E. coli ACC (in gray)46. The bound positions of biotin (black) and ADP
(green) in the E. coli BC structure are also shown. The two-fold axis of the dimer is
indicated with the black oval. With the two monomers at the bottom overlaid, a difference of
21° in the orientations of the two monomers at the top is observed. Most of the B domain of
BC is ordered in one of the two monomers of MapLCC. In the other monomer, only weak
electron density is observed for a few segments, and the B domain is not modeled. (b).
Overlay of the structures of the CT domain hexamer of MapLCC (in color) and the β subunit
of PCC (in gray)47. Each enzyme is highly conserved across species, and therefore the
overlay should be meaningful. (c). Stereo drawing of the overlay of the CT domain dimer of
MapLCC (in color) and the β subunit of PCC (in gray). The view is down the red arrow of
panel b. The bound position of biotin in the holoenzyme is shown (black). The position of
CoA is modeled based on that of CoA bound in the active site of the CT domain of yeast
ACC48. (d). Plot of the temperature factor value of each Cα atom in the two monomers (in
red and blue). Several linker regions with high temperature factor values are indicated.

Electron microscopy studies of LCC. (a). Representative raw image of negatively stained
MapLCC. “S” marks a side view of the holoenzyme, and “C” indicates a contaminant. Scale
bar: 500 Å. (b). The 308 class averages of negatively stained MapLCC obtained from 19
generations of the iterative stable alignment and clustering (ISAC) procedure49 implemented
in SPARX50. These class averages represent 65% (15,932 particles) of the entire data set
(24,535 particles). Averages representing side views are marked with a “S”, averages that
were used to create Supplementary Video S1 are marked with a “*”, and averages that
represent a contaminant are marked with “C”. The side length of the individual panels is 340
Å. (c). The averages obtained by classifying all 24,535 particles of negatively stained
MapLCC into 300 classes using K-means classification in SPIDER51. Averages are shown
in rows with the most populous class at the top left and the least populous class at the

the structure of the complex with yeast ACC CT domain48. The α6 helix in the N domain of
monomer 6 shows a more closed conformation (indicated with the red arrow), and clashes
with the CoA model. There is also a clash with the adenine base of CoA. There may be a
conformational change in this region of MapLCC for CoA binding. (b). Molecular surface

Phenotypic differences between wild-type and LCC knockout (ΔPA14_46320) P.
aeruginosa strains, revealed by a colorimetric assay that monitors reduction of a tetrazolium
dye. The conditions were identified from a screen that sampled 1920 different media (Biolog
Inc, Hayward, CA). Assays were carried out twice in each medium for the wild-type (red
and orange) and mutant (blue and cyan) strains. Shown are activity profiles for strains
incubated with Gly-Pro as the sole carbon source (top panel) and Asp-Phe, Glu-Val, and
Met-Asp as the sole nitrogen source (bottom panels). For each panel, the horizontal axis is
