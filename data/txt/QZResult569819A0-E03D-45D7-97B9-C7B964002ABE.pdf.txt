BACKGROUND. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether polymorphisms of p53 codon 72 (Arg72Pro) and MDM2 SNP309 (309T>G) affect p53 expression and the clinical outcome of patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung
cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS. A total of 148 NSCLC patients, previously enrolled in 2 different prospective clinical trials, were genotyped for the p53 Arg72Pro and MDM2 309T>G

polymorphisms. Immunohistochemical staining of p53 protein was performed on
61 tumor samples. Genotypes were correlated with p53 expression, clinicopathologic factors, tumor response, and survival. Multivariate logistic or Cox regression
analyses were used to adjust for possible confounding variables.

RESULTS. The distribution of sex, age, performance status, stage, tumor histology,
and smoking habit was not significantly different among polymorphism variants.
However, a significant association was observed between p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and primary resistance to chemotherapy. Patients with the Pro/Pro
variant were more likely to be resistant to first-line chemotherapy, especially the
irinotecan plus cisplatin regimen, than those with Arg/Arg or Arg/Pro variants
(60% vs 27%, P 5 .014). In multivariate analysis, the Pro/Pro genotype was
strongly predictive for shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio
[HR] 5 1.952, P 5 .01). The p53 overexpression was associated with MDM2
SNP309. The TT genotype showed more p53 overexpression than TG or GG genotypes (P 5 .036). In multivariate analysis, the MDM2 TT genotype was independently predictive for longer survival (HR 5 1.742, P 5 .032).

CONCLUSIONS. The p53 72Pro/Pro variant was predictive for primary resistance
to chemotherapy and shorter progression-free survival. The MDM2 SNP309 was
associated with less p53 overexpression and prognostic for worse survival. Genotyping these polymorphisms may be useful for predicting the clinical outcome of
advanced NSCLC. Cancer 2008;113:799–807.  2008 American Cancer Society.

T

he p53 gene is a well-known tumor suppressor gene that
encodes a nuclear protein that induces growth arrest or apoptosis in response to cellular stress.1 When the p53 pathway is inhibited, cancer progression is accelerated and resistance to
chemotherapy is developed.2 Indeed, p53 function is compromised
in the majority of human cancers.3-5 MDM2 is an oncoprotein that
binds to p53 and inactivates the p53 tumor suppressor activity.6
MDM2 can inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53 by binding
directly to the N-terminal transactivation domain.7,8 MDM2 also
functions as an E3 ligase, covalently attaching ubiquitin molecules
to p53, which leads to both the export of p53 to the cytoplasm and

proteasomal degradation.9,10 Many cancer cells have
high levels of the oncogenic MDM2 protein because
of either increased expression or amplification of the
mdm2 gene.11,12 In addition, a common polymorphism in the MDM2 promoter region, a T to G change
at nucleotide 309 in the first intron (single nucleotide
polymorphism [SNP] 309) is shown to increase the
affinity for binding stimulatory protein (Sp) 1 and
results in higher levels of MDM2 expression.13 Cells
homozygous for SNP309 express higher levels of
MDM2, thereby weakening the p53 pathway. In
humans, MDM2 SNP309 is associated with accelerated tumor formation in both hereditary and sporadic cancers.14 Moreover, MDM2 overexpression is
associated with rapid cancer progression and lack of
response to therapy in a subset of human cancers.15
The p53 function is also altered by a common
sequence polymorphism within the p53 gene that
encodes either arginine (Arg) or proline (Pro) at
codon 72 in exon 4.16-19 The Pro72 and Arg72 variants have been reported to differ in functional activity because this polymorphism is located in the
proline-rich domain of p53, which is necessary for
the p53 protein to fully induce apoptosis.20 Recent
experimental studies have shown that the Arg72 variant is more efficient in inducing apoptosis than the
Pro72 variant in cells with endogenous p53.19,21
Furthermore, patients with inoperable head and neck
cancer whose cancer retained a wildtype Arg72 allele
had a higher response rate to chemoradiotherapy
and longer survival than those with the wildtype
Pro72 variant.22 All of these trends may be explained
by the increased apoptotic potential of the 72Arg variant and implicate p53 codon 72 polymorphism as
an important determinant of cellular sensitivity to
chemotherapy.
Given the possibility that polymorphic variants
of p53 codon 72 and MDM2 SNP309 may modulate
p53 function, we hypothesized that treatment outcomes of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients
may be influenced by these polymorphisms. In the
current study, we investigate whether p53 codon 72
and MDM2 SNP309 polymorphisms are associated
with tumor response and survival of advanced
NSCLC patients treated with chemotherapy. We also
examine p53 expression in NSCLC tumor samples by
using immunohistochemistry to determine effects of
these polymorphisms on p53 protein alteration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
A total of 148 patients with histologically confirmed
advanced NSCLC who received irinotecan plus cis-

platin or gemcitabine plus vinorelbine chemotherapy
as first-line chemotherapy were included in this
study. These 148 patients were treated in our institution from September 2002 to June 2005 as a part of 2
different prospective phase 2 studies, which included
a total of 226 patients.23,24 Patients were required to
have: 1) pathologically confirmed stage IIIB with
pleural effusion or stage IV NSCLC; 2) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
(PS) 0 to 2 scores; 3) adequate organ function, (i) hematology: absolute neutrophil count 2.0 3 109/L,
platelets 150 3 109/L; (ii) hepatic: serum bilirubin
(bili) 1.03 the upper limit of normal (ULN), AST/ALT
1.53 ULN, alkaline phosphatase or gamma-glutamyltransferase 2.53 ULN; (iii) renal: serum creatinine
1.5 mg/dL; 4) no prior chemotherapy. Treatment
consisted of irinotecan 65 or 80 mg/m2 plus cisplatin
30 mg/m2 or gemcitabine 900 mg/m2 plus vinorelbine 25 mg/m2, each given on Days 1 and 8 every 3
weeks.
Blood samples for genotyping and demographic
information including age, sex, and smoking status
were collected at the time of recruitment. Those who
smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime were
defined as never smokers; otherwise, they were considered smokers. All patients gave written informed
consent approved by the Institutional Review Board
of the National Cancer Center Hospital. The study
was performed in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

Genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood by
using a DNA-purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif).
Polymorphisms at codon 72 in the p53 gene were
determined by using a polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) restriction fragment-length polymorphism
(RFLP)-based method. A 366 base pair (bp) fragment
of the p53 gene was amplified by PCR by using forward primer 50 -GTCCTCTGACTGCTCTTTTCACCCATCTAC-30 and reverse primer 50 -GGGATACGGCCA
GGCATTGAAGTCTC-30 . Polymorphisms at SNP309 in
the MDM2 gene were determined by using a direct
sequencing. A 400-bp fragment of the MDM2 gene
was amplified by PCR by using forward primer 50 GTTTTGTTGGACTGGGGCTA-30 and reverse primer
50 -CACTGAACACAGCTGGGAAA-30 . Laboratory personnel blinded to patient status performed genotyping and a random 5% of samples were repeated to
validate genotyping procedures. The assay and
restriction enzyme for studying polymorphisms are
described elsewhere.25,26

Immunohistochemical Staining of p53
The formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were
cut into 4-lm sections and dried on capillary-gap
glass slides (ChemMate; BioTEK Solutions, Santa Barbara, Calif). The sections were deparaffinized with
standard xylene and hydrated through graded alcohols into water. Antigen retrieval was performed by
using citrate buffer and heating for 5 minutes in a
pressure cooker. Staining was performed at room
temperature on an automatic staining workstation
(TechMate 1000; BioTEK Solutions) by using the
Envision peroxidase mouse system (Envision Plus;
Dako, Carpinteria, Calif ). Slides were placed for 10
minutes in a 3% hydrogen peroxide blocking medium and then allowed to react with the primary
antibody. The anti-p53 immunoglobulin G monoclonal antibody (clone DO-7; DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, Calif), which is known to react to both
wildtype and mutant forms of the p53 protein, was
used at 1:200 dilution for 45 minutes at room temperature. Immunodetection was performed with the
Envision system and with diaminobenzidine chromogen used as the substrate (Dako). Counterstaining
with hematoxylin for 1 minute was the final step. After they were stained, the slides were dehydrated
through graded alcohols and mounted with a coverslip that used a standard medium. Appropriate positive controls were used (a T2N0M0, welldifferentiated glottic tumor known to express p53 in
> 90% of tumor cells). Negative controls with an
omission of the antiserum from the primary incubation were also included. Evaluation of the immunohistochemistry was conducted blindly, without
knowledge of the clinical and pathologic characteristics of the patients. Staining for p53 was scored 3 if
greater than 50% of tumor cells were immunostained
positive; 2 if 26% to 50% of cells were positive; 1 if
11% to 25% of cells were positive; and 0 if less than
10% of cells were positive. The stains were graded
p53 overexpression if the score was 2 or 3.27
Statistical Analysis
Associations between genotype and individual clinicopathologic factors were assessed by using a w2 test
or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Responses were
assessed according to World Health Organization criteria. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the
first day of treatment until death or last known follow-up. The progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated as the time between the first day of
treatment and disease progression, death, or last
known follow-up. Survival probabilities were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method and
assessed by using a log-rank test. Multivariate logistic

or Cox regression models were used to adjust for
potential confounding variables with genotypes. Statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS (Chicago, Ill), and 2-sided P-values <0.05 were
considered significant.

frequencies for the p53 Arg72Pro and MDM2 SNP309
were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P 5 .9 and .8,
respectively; Table 1). There was no significant difference among these polymorphisms’ status in terms of
sex, age, performance status (PS), stage, histology, or
smoking habit (Table 2). Of 148 patients, 61 tumor
samples were available for immunohistochemical
staining of p53 protein, and p53 overexpression was
observed in 19 (31%) cases (Table 1).

Genotype and Response to Chemotherapy
Of 148 examined patients, 147 were assessable for tumor response. Overall, 52 (35.4%) patients had a partial response (PR), 49 (33.3%) had stable disease
(SD), and 46 (31.3%) had progressive disease (PD).
Although baseline patient characteristics were not
significantly associated with tumor response (data
not shown), p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism showed a
significant association with sensitivity to chemotherapy. Patients with the Pro/Pro variant were more
likely to have PD at first-line chemotherapy than
those with Arg/Arg or Arg/Pro variants (56% vs 28%;
P 5 .018; Table 3). Although it was not significant,
patients with MDM2 SNP309 TG or GG genotypes
also showed a trend for more resistance to chemotherapy than TT genotype (44% vs 22%; P 5 .194; Table 3). When the association between these
polymorphisms and tumor response was estimated
for each of the first-line regimens separately, p53

codon 72 Pro/Pro variant was significantly associated
with higher PD among patients treated with irinotecan plus cisplatin chemotherapy (P 5 .014), whereas
no significant association was observed among
patients treated with gemcitabine plus vinorelbine
chemotherapy (P 5 1.0).

Genotype and Survival
At the time of the final analysis (July 2007), 144
patients showed disease progression and 36 patients
were alive. The median follow-up was 38.2 months
(range, 0.4-58.6 months). In the entire group, the median PFS time was 4.4 months (95% confidence
interval [CI], 4.0-4.8 months), and the median OS
time was 14.4 months (95% CI, 11.8-17.1 months).
The p53 codon 72 polymorphism status showed
a significant association with PFS (P 5 .024; Fig. 1).
Patients with the Pro/Pro variant that was significantly associated with higher PD had a shorter median PFS time of 2.7 months (95% CI, 1.9-3.6
months) compared with 4.6 months (95% CI, 3.8-5.5
months) for those with Arg/Arg or Arg/Pro variants,
whereas MDM2 SNP309 demonstrated a significant
association with OS (P 5 .040; Fig. 2). Patients with
the TT genotype had a longer median OS time of
16.5 months (95% CI, 9.9-23.1) compared with 13.6
months (95% CI, 11.2.-15.9 months) for those with
the GG or TG genotypes.

To estimate the independent impact of each variable on survival, a descriptive Cox proportional
hazard model was performed. Univariate analysis
identified that ECOG PS of 2, squamous cell carcinoma, and p53 codon 72 Pro/Pro variant were each
associated with shorter PFS (Table 4), whereas older
age (>60 years), ECOG PS of 2, squamous cell carcinoma, smoking pack-years, and MDM SNP 309 TG
or GG genotypes were associated with shorter OS
(Table 5). Finally, multivariate Cox regression analysis
identified that an ECOG PS of 2 (hazard ratio
[HR] 5 2.6; P 5 .001) and p53 codon 72 Pro/Pro vari-

ant (HR 5 2.0; P 5 .010) were predictive of shorter
PFS (Table 4); whereas an ECOG PS of 2 (HR 5 1.9,
P 5 .035) and MDM2 SNP309 TG or GG genotypes
(HR 5 1.7; P 5 .032) were predictive of shorter OS
(Table 5).

Genotype and p53 Protein Overexpression
To investigate whether these polymorphisms regulate
p53 expression, we analyzed the association between
each polymorphism and p53 protein overexpression
in tumor tissues. Overexpression of p53 protein was
determined by immunohistochemical staining, and
19 of 61 (31%) tumors overexpressed p53 protein

(staining 2 to 3). Although the difference in median
survival distributed by p53 overexpression status was
not significant, patients with p53 overexpression had
a tendency toward a longer OS of 13.0 months (95%
CI, 8.7-17.4 months) than those without p53 overexpression (median OS, 11.5 months; 95% CI, 9.3-13.7

between MDM2 SNP309 status and tumor p53 protein overexpression (P 5 .023; Table 6). Patients with
TG or GG genotype had fewer tumors that aberrantly
expressed p53 (12 of 49 [24%] tumors) than those
with TT genotype (7 of 12 [58%] tumors), whereas no
significant association was observed between p53
codon 72 polymorphism and p53 protein expression.
This finding suggests that the MDM2 SNP309 G variant allele may more efficiently target p53 protein for
degradation than the common genotype (TT).

DISCUSSION
There is increasing evidence that allele variants in
some oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes are
candidates for genetic risk factors that may alter the
clinical outcome of lung cancer. In the current study,
we evaluated effects of p53 codon 72 and MDM2
SNP309 polymorphisms on the clinical outcome of
patients with advanced NSCLC treated with chemotherapy. Our data indicate that p53 codon 72 and
MDM2 SNP309 polymorphisms could be functionally
important in patients with advanced NSCLC. We
found that the p53 72Pro/Pro genotype was more
likely to be resistant to cisplatin-based chemotherapy
and to predict a worse PFS. These findings are consistent with prior findings that link the 72Pro variant
to less apoptotic potential than the 72Arg variant.19,21
Recently, Hu et al28 examined the effect of this poly-

morphism on p53 mutation and survival in patients
with surgically resected NSCLC. They found that the
number of codon 72 Pro alleles was independently
associated with p53 mutation. However, they did not
find any influence of this polymorphism on survival.
Meanwhile, Nelson et al29 reported that there was no
difference in the prevalence of p53 mutation by constitutional p53 codon 72 polymorphism status in
patients with surgically resectable NSCLC. Instead,
they found that the combination of p53 mutation
with the codon 72 Pro variant predicts worse survival. This finding suggests that a loss of p53 function may be linked to the 72 Pro allele.
In our study, MDM2 SNP309 status was not significantly associated with tumor response to chemotherapy. However, this variant showed a significant
association with OS because it appeared to modify
the p53 tumor-suppressor pathway. This finding is
also consistent with other reports that the MDM2
SNP309 GG genotype is associated with higher
MDM2 levels than the TT genotype, which may
decrease p53 expression and subsequently attenuate
the p53 pathway.13,14
The p53 pathway is important in determining
cancer progression and tumor response to chemotherapy.30 In patients with NSCLC, the p53 gene is
inactivated by mutations in greater than 50%.31,32 So
far, many studies have evaluated alterations of either
the p53 gene or protein product as prognostic or predictive markers in lung cancer; however, some have
reported disparate results. A meta-analysis of 11 retrospective studies that collectively included more
than 1000 patients demonstrated a negative prognostic effect of p53 mutations in NSCLC.33 In contrast,
prospective trials that examined the prognostic role
of p53 mutation failed to demonstrate prognostic or
predictive value in patients with resected NSCLC.34,35
Similar to observations of the p53 mutation, the relation between p53 overexpression and survival in
NSCLC has been controversial. Some studies have

805

found an improved survival with p53 overexpression.36-38 Conversely, another series identified
a significant reduction in survival with p53 overexpression.39,40 Another study has shown no correlation
between p53 overexpression and survival.41 Thus, the
clinical usefulness of p53 mutational status or overexpression for predicting survival or response to
treatment in NSCLC remains controversial and warrants further study. In the current study, we did not
examine the mutational status of p53 because of a
lack of available tissue slides. Instead, we observed
immunohistochemical staining of p53 on some available samples. Although we examined p53 expression
in limited numbers of samples, no significant relation between p53 overexpression and tumor response
or survival was observed.
Generally, simultaneous p53 mutation and
MDM2 amplification do not occur within the same
tumor, which suggests that MDM2 overexpression
can substitute for inactivating p53 by mutation.42,43
As MDM2 expression levels seem to regulate the p53
pathway, MDM2 overexpression was observed in
many human cancers including NSCLC. However,
results have been inconsistent in NSCLC patients.
Some studies have found that MDM2 overexpression
is correlated with poorly differentiated tumor and
advanced stage,44,45 whereas others have observed
that MDM2 overexpression correlates with favorable
prognostic parameters.27,46 Very recently, Heist et al47
reported that the GG genotype showed worse OS in
early-stage NSCLC. Consistently, we found that
patients with a GT or GG genotype showed significantly shorter OS than those with a TT genotype. In
multivariate analyses, MDM2 SNP309 was independently predictive for OS as well as PS. Moreover, the
GT or GG genotype showed less overexpression of
p53 than the TT genotype. Theses findings indicate
that regulation of p53 by MDM2 may influence prognosis of NSCLC. Furthermore, activation of p53 in tumor cells by inhibiting its physical interaction with
MDM2 has been the focus of cancer drug discovery,48 which further supports the importance of a
p53-MDM2 interaction in cancer progression.
In summary, we have demonstrated that p53
codon 72 polymorphism is both predictive for worse
response to chemotherapy and prognostic for worse
PFS. Although the prognostic value of p53 overexpression has not been demonstrated in this study,
MDM2 SNP309 was associated with less p53 overexpression and was prognostic for worse survival.
These observations suggest that genotyping of these
polymorphisms may be helpful for predicting clinical
outcomes of patients with advanced NSCLC. However, we did not examine the association between

p53 gene mutations with these polymorphisms.
Therefore, further validation would be needed to
confirm the predictive and prognostic role of these
polymorphisms in NSCLC.
