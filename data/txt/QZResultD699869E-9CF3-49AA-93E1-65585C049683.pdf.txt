Mutations in the TP53 tumour-suppressor gene are common in human tumours. Although
these mutations invariably inactivate the normal activity of p53 (ref. 1), which is the
transcription factor encoded by TP53, some mutations also endow p53 with ‘gain-offunction’ activities that promote cancer2. Whether diverse p53 mutants produce similar gainof-function activities and how they do so remains a puzzle, but finding the answer might
enable the design of strategies for treating many cancers. On page 206 of this issue, Zhu et
al.3 provide a possible explanation: they show that gain-of-function mutant p53 proteins
induce the production of enzymes that modify the histone proteins around which DNA is
packaged as chromatin, thus altering gene expression.

Experimentally altering the expression of gain-of-function mutant p53 affects the expression
of myriad genes, enhancing the invasiveness and proliferation of tumour cells in vitro4.
Moreover, mice harbouring key gain-of-function mutations in TP53 develop tumours that
differ from those lacking p53 (ref. 5). Lowering the level of gain-of-function p53 has
antiproliferative effects in vitro and can reduce metastasis or trigger tumour regression in
vivo2, 5, 6. A better understanding of these mutants is therefore desirable. Zhu et al. found
that, in cultured human-cancer cell lines, gain-of-function mutant forms of p53 bind to
different regions of DNA from the normal protein. In particular, the mutant proteins bind to
the genes MLL1 and MLL2. Gain-of-function p53 seems to be recruited to these genes in
part through binding to ETS2 — a transcription factor that is known7 to target gain-offunction p53 to different genes from those activated by normal p53.

Author Manuscript

MLL1 and MLL2 are members of the SET family of histone methyltransferase enzymes8.
These act as parts of large complexes9 to modulate gene expression by attaching methyl
groups to a lysine amino-acid residue (K4) of the histone H3 protein. Such H3K4
methylation allows increased transcription of the gene packaged around the histones. The
authors found that gain-of-function p53 also activates expression of the gene MOZ, which
encodes an enzyme that adds an acetyl group to K9 of H3, again allowing increased gene
expression.

The finding that genes encoding enzymes that modify histone proteins are among the targets of certain mutant forms of the p53
protein sheds light on how these mutations cause cancer beyond p53 inactivation.

In agreement with the idea that gain-of-function p53 affects histone modification, reducing
levels of the mutant p53 decreased H3K9 acetylation. However, p53 reduction had only a
small effect on H3K4 methylation. Perhaps, as Zhu and colleagues suggest, this is because
other members of the SET family have similar but p53-independent roles to MLL1 and
MLL2. The authors demonstrated that gain-of-function p53 activates MLL1, MLL2 and
MOZ, and showed that this activation is partly responsible for the ability of the mutant p53
to enhance cell proliferation in vitro (Fig. 1).

Finally, mining human-cancer databases provided support for Zhu and colleagues’ data,
indicating that expression of MLL1, MLL2 and MOZ is significantly upregulated in human
tumours with select p53 gain-of-function mutants compared with tumours lacking p53 or
those without mutant p53. This correlation is not obvious across breast cancers10, the tissue
of origin for many cell lines studied in this work — although Zhu et al. clearly show that
such a correlation exists in the cell lines that they used. It is likely that other variables affect
MLL expression in some tumour types. As a result, it will be important to investigate the
contextual factors that determine whether or when gain-of-function p53 can trigger changes
in MLL and MOZ expression, and to analyse the mechanisms underlying these events.
Gain-of-function p53 was also recently shown11 to act with the SWI/SNF chromatinremodelling complex to upregulate many genes that can themselves mediate the cancercausing activities of gain-of-function p53. This finding, taken together with Zhu and
colleagues’ demonstration that this p53 is linked to chromatin and, by extension, to the
transcriptome (the complete gene-expression profile of the cell), could explain why so many
genes are affected by the presence of gain-of-function p53. But precisely how p53 proteins
with diverse mutations acquire similar capabilities remains to be discovered.

Author Manuscript

One possibility is that p53 mutants adopt a different structure from normal p53 that enables
their interaction with ETS2. However, there is no obvious explanation for the evolution of
such an interaction, and this model is at odds with the observation12 that some gain-offunction p53 proteins have similar structures to normal p53. Alternatively, the ability of
normal p53 to bind to thousands of sites in the human genome might prevent it from
associating with the factors with which gain-of-function p53 interacts. Or perhaps the
expression of one or more target genes somehow actively prevents the normal protein from
engaging in the interactions that are characteristic of the mutant p53.

Author Manuscript

The authors’ link between gain-of-function p53 and MLL1 and MLL2 is intriguing, given
that members of the MLL family are frequently mutated in human cancers13. For example,
chromosomal translocations involving MLL1 can drive leukaemia, and MLL2 mutations are
common in several carcinomas. But MLL1 translocations eliminate the gene’s histone
methyltransferase domain, and MLL2 mutations seem to be inactivating. The explanation for
this apparent discrepancy with Zhu and colleagues’ findings is unclear, but probably reflects
context-dependent differences in enzyme function.
Could targeting MLL1, MLL2 or MOZ be a strategy for treating tumours involving gain-offunction p53? Zhu et al. showed that two inhibitors of MLL-complex formation block
proliferation in cells expressing mutant p53, but do not affect those lacking p53. Eliminating

gain-of-function p53 or interfering with its mechanism of action can have anticancer effects
in vitro and in mice6, 14, 15. Moreover, there is much enthusiasm for cancer treatments that
affect chromatin modification, and compounds that target some chromatin-modifying
activities have been approved for use in the clinic or are currently in clinical trials. But more
work is required, because the specificity of the MLL inhibitors is not entirely established.
Furthermore, MLL genes are active during embryonic development, and their inhibition can
cause embryonic death, independent of TP53 mutations14. These observations, together with
the previously mentioned fact that mutations disrupting MLL function are common in
tumours, raise concerns that MLL inhibitors might be toxic, or might even promote tumours.

Author Manuscript

Nonetheless, given the frequency with which TP53 is mutated in cancer, continued efforts to
modulate the effects of mutant p53 are clearly warranted. With the key targets of MLL and
MOZ in hand, specific therapies might become possible. Thus, Zhu and colleagues’ study,
and those of others, might point to treatments for tumours that harbour TP53 mutations.

‘Gain-of-function’ mutations in the tumour-suppressor gene TP53 enable the transcription
factor that it encodes to bind to abnormal targets, leading to cancer. Zhu et al.3 report that
gain-of-function p53 binds to the transcription factor ETS2 and activates the genes MLL1,
MLL2 and MOZ. MLL1 and MLL2 encode MLL enzymes that add methyl groups (Me) to
the histone proteins around which genes are packaged as chromatin, and MOZ adds acetyl
groups (Ac) to these histones. Both modifications increase local gene expression, leading to
an increase in the proliferation of cancer cells through as-yet-unknown mechanisms.
