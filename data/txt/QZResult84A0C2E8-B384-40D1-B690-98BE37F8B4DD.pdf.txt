Abstract

Author Manuscript

Despite the clinical success of tamoxifen, its resistance remains a major challenge in breast cancer.
Here we show that Aurora-A determines tamoxifen sensitivity by regulation of estrogen receptor
(ER)α. Ectopic expression of Aurora-A decreases and depletion of Aurora-A enhances tamoxifen
sensitivity in ERα-positive breast cancer. Elevated Aurora-A was significantly associated with the
recurrence of ERα-positive tumours. Notably, Aurora-A inhibitor MLN8237, which is currently in
clinical trial, synergizes with tamoxifen and overcomes tamoxifen-resistance. Furthermore,
Aurora-A interacts with and phosphorylates ERα on serine-167 and -305, leading to increase in
ERα DNA-binding and transcriptional activity. Elevated levels of Aurora-A are significantly
associated with disease-free survival in ERα-positive but not -negative breast cancers. These data
suggest that Aurora-A plays a pivotal role in tamoxifen resistance and ERα is a bona fide substrate
of Aurora-A. Thus, Aurora-A represents a prognostic marker in ERα-positive tumor and a critical
therapeutic target in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer, and Aurora-A inhibitor could be used as
either an independent or concurrent agent in tamoxifen-resistant tumour.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Aurora-A is a mitotic serine/threonine kinase, which is evolutionally conserved and is
localized at the centrosome.1 Activation of Aurora-A is required for mitotic entry,
centrosome maturation and separation and G2 to M transition.2 It has been shown that
Aurora-A is frequently amplified and/or overexpressed in breast carcinoma.3 In animal
models, estrogen-induced rat breast cancers expressed high levels of Aurora-A and
displayed centrosome amplification and aneuploidy.4 Moreover, mouse mammary tumour
virus (MMTV)-driven Aurora-A transgenic mice developed breast tumours and genetic
instability occurred prior to tumorigenesis in mammary epithelial cells.5 In addition, recent
studies have shown that Aurora-A promotes distant metastases only in ERα-positive breast
cancer cells.6, 7 These findings indicate the critical role of Aurora-A in mammary
carcinogenesis. However, the role of Aurora-A in endocrine-therapy resistance and ERα
signaling remains largely unknown.

Author Manuscript

ERα is a hormone-dependent nuclear transcription factor expressed in approximately 70%
of breast tumours.8 The binding of estrogen to ERα results in ERα dimerization and its
recruitment to the estrogen-responsive elements (EREs) on the promoters of ERα target
genes.9, 10 Because ERα plays a major role in the development and progression of breast
cancer, current endocrine therapies for breast cancer are mainly based on targeting the ERα
signaling pathway. Among the endocrine therapies targeting ERα, the selective estrogen
receptor modulator tamoxifen, which inhibits breast cancer growth through competitive
binding of ERα, has been the principal endocrine therapy for breast cancer for the past 30
years.11 However, tamoxifen resistance presents a major challenge in treating the
disease.12–14 ERα is a key determinant of breast cancer susceptibility to endocrine therapy,
and post-translational modifications of ERα often lead to endocrine resistance.15 The
phosphorylation of ERα has long been implicated in modulating endocrine response 16, 17
and has been shown to influence ERα-binding potential and gene expression profiles,16
resulting in tamoxifen resistance.

Author Manuscript

In this study, we demonstrated a critical role of Aurora-A in regulation of tamoxifen
sensitivity. Aurora-A inhibitor MLN8237 synergized with tamoxifen to inhibit cell growth
and cell survival and to overcome tamoxifen resistance. Furthermore, Aurora-A interacted
with ERα and phosphorylated ERα-Ser167/Ser305. The phosphorylation of ERα by AuroraA resulted in activation of ERα in the absence of estrogen. These data indicate that AuroraA plays an important role in regulation of ERα activity and tamoxifen resistance, and thus
could be a therapeutic target in breast cancer endocrine-therapy. In addition, these findings
underscore the potential of MLN8237 as either an independent or concurrent agent in
tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer and the pERα-Ser167/Ser305 as potential clinical
biomarkers in Aurora-A inhibitor therapy.

RESULTS
Knockdown of Aurora-A reverses tamoxifen resistance and ectopic expression of AuroraA renders cells resistance to tamoxifen

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Previously studies showed frequent overexpression/activation of Aurora-A in breast cancer
and a critical role of Aurora-A in mammary epithelial cell immortalization and
transformation.5, 18 When we examined Aurora-A expression in a panel of breast cancer cell
lines, we found elevated levels of Aurora-A protein and p-Aurora-A-T288 in tamoxifenresistant BT474 and MCF7-TamR cells as compared to tamoxifen-responsive MCF7 cells
(Figure 1a). These findings prompted us to assess the role of Aurora-A in tamoxifen
resistance. We initially assessed the tamoxifen sensitivity in 3 ERα-positive and 1 ERαnegative cell lines (Figure S1) and subsequently knocked down Aurora-A in BT474 and
MCF7-TamR cells using 2 siRNAs against different coding regions of Aurora-A (Figures 1b
and S2a). Following incubation for 2 days, the cells were treated with and without
increasing doses of tamoxifen for 72 hours and then subjected to MTT, Annexin V/FACS
and colony formation assays. In agreement with previous reports, tamoxifen alone had
minimal effect on cell death and colony growth in tamoxifen-resistant BT474 and MCF7TamR cells.19 However, knockdown of Aurora-A significantly reduced cell survival and
colony formation, and enhanced tamoxifen anti-tumour effects in both BT474 and MCF7TamR cell lines (Figures 1c–e, and Figures S2b and 2c). To further examine the role of
Aurora-A in tamoxifen sensitivity, we ectopically expressed Aurora-A in tamoxifenresponsive MCF7 cells (Figure 2a). The cells transfected with empty vector were used as
controls. Following treatment with tamoxifen, we found that overexpression of Aurora-A
rendered MCF7 cells resistance to tamoxifen (Figures 2b–d). As controls, we evaluated the
effects of Aurora-A on response to tamoxifen in ERα-negative cells. Aurora-A was knocked
down and ectopically expressed in MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively.
After administration of tamoxifen, cell viability and colony formation were found no
difference between Aurora-A-manipulated and control-siRNA/vector-treated cells in both
ERα-negative cell lines (Figure S3). These data indicate that Aurora-A plays a role in
tamoxifen resistance and could be a critical therapeutic target for overcoming the resistance
in ERα-positive breast cancer cells.
Aurora-A inhibitor MLN8237 cooperates with tamoxifen and overcomes tamoxifenresistance in vitro and in vivo

Author Manuscript

Since tamoxifen-resistant MCF7-TamR and BT474 cells expressed high levels of Aurora-A
and knockdown of Aurora-A reduced the resistance, we further investigated whether
Aurora-A inhibitor MLN8237, which is currently in clinical trial,20 is able to overcome
tamoxifen resistance and to cooperate with tamoxifen. We first treated MCF7-TamR and
BT474 cells with various concentrations of MLN8237 and tamoxifen alone and in
combination and monitored cell survival. Figures 3a and 3c show that MLN8237 alone
inhibited p-Aurora-A-T288 and caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cell survival with
IC50 values of ~4.0 μm/L, whereas tamoxifen alone had much less effect on cell survival
with IC50 values of greater than 5 μm/L. However, combination treatment of cells with
Aurora-A inhibitor and tamoxifen resulted in significant cell death with IC50 values of
tamoxifen from greater than 5 μm/L (in the absence of MLN8237) to 0.1 μm/L (in the

presence of 0.5 μmol/L MLN8237; Figure S4). In addition, we found that combination of
MLN8237 and tamoxifen increased cleavage of PARP, caspase-7 (MCF7-TamR) or caspase
3 (BT474) more significantly than either one alone (Figure 3b). Therefore, MLN8237
sensitized MCF7-TamR and BT474 cells to tamoxifen. To further examine if MLN8237
synergizes with tamoxifen, we treated cells with a combination of MLN8237 and tamoxifen
and used Calcusyn software to generate Fa-CI plots as described under Methods. Figure S4
shows that almost all the experimental points have CI values of less than 1.0. The resulting
Fa-CI plot curve falls well below 1 for the effect range, showing that the combination of
MLN8237 and tamoxifen is synergistic in tamoxifen-resistant MCF7-TamR and BT474
cells.

We next determined whether Aurora-A inhibitor MLN8237 overcomes tamoxifen resistance
in vivo. Orthotopic tumours were established by injection of BT474 cells into the mammary
fat pads of athymic nude mice. After implanted tumours reached approximately 100 mm3 in
size, the mice were randomized in 4 groups (7 mice/group): vehicle, tamoxifen alone,
MLN8237 alone, and both tamoxifen and MLN8237. As control, orthopotic tumours with
tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 cells were also established and administered with tamoxifen and
vehicle (Figure S5). The mice were treated for 12 consecutive days and the tumour growth
was monitored for an additional 1 week (Figure 3d). While the control group tumour
reached 1500 mm3 in volume at the endpoint of the assay, the MLN8237-treated tumours
grew much slower than control and tamoxifen-treated groups. Treatment with tamoxifen
alone completely inhibited MCF7 tumour growth but only caused an approximately 10%
reduction in BT474 tumour size compared with the control group (Figures 3d and S5),
whereas the combination of both MLN8237 and tamoxifen significantly repressed BT474
tumour growth (Figure 3d). Similarly, the BT474 tumour weight in MLN8237- and the
combination-treated groups was dramatically reduced as compared with control and
tamoxifen-treated groups (Figure 3e). Immunoblotting analysis of the representative
tumours revealed that p-Aurora-A-T288 was inhibited by MLN8237 and that PARP
cleavage was induced in the tumours treated with MLN8237 alone and combination of
MLN8237 and tamoxifen (Figure 3f). Moreover, immunostaining with cleavage caspase-3
and Ki-67 antibodies showed that inhibition of Aurora-A alone and combination with
tamoxifen significantly activated caspase-3 and inhibited proliferation (Figure 3g). Taken
together, these data indicate that Aurora-A inhibitor MLN8237 not only overcomes
tamoxifen resistance but also synergizes with tamoxifen in vitro and in vivo.
Aurora-A induces ERα transactivation activity

Author Manuscript

Post-translational modification of ERα has been shown to be one of major mechanisms in
tamoxifen resistance.21, 22 Thus, we next investigated if Aurora-A regulates ERα
transactivation activity. Reporter assay was performed by introducing ERα responsive
element reporter (ERE-Luc) combined with HA-Aurora-A into MCF7 cells, and the results
showed that Aurora-A strongly induced ERα transactivation activity in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 4a). In addition, the reporter activity induced by E2 was further increased by
expression of Aurora-A (Figure S6a). However, E2- but not Aurora-A-induced ERα
activation was inhibited by tamoxifen (Figure S6b). Furthermore, the effect of Aurora-A on
ERE-Luc activity was evaluated in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Following

transfection of ERE-Luc and ERα together with and without Aurora-A, luciferase assay
revealed that expression of ERα alone moderately induced ERE-Luc activity. However, the
reporter activity was significantly stimulated by co-expression of ERα and Aurora-A (Figure
4b). These data suggest that Aurora-A not only activates ERα activity but also enhances E2
action and that Aurora-A-induced ERα activation could not be inhibited by tamoxifen.
Aurora-A interacts with and phosphorylates ERα

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To determine the mechanism by which Aurora-A induces ERα transactivation activity, we
initially performed co-immunoprecipitation in MDA-MB-231 cells following transfection of
GFP-ERα and HA-Aurora-A. Figure 4c shows that HA-Aurora-A interacted with GFP-ERα.
We next examined if endogenous ERα and Aurora-A forms a complex. Coimmunoprecipitation was carried out in MCF7-TamR cells, which express elevated AuroraA and ERα (Figure 1a). As shown in Figure 4d, ERα was readily detected in Aurora-A
immunoprecipitates and vice versa. Furthermore, GST-pull down assay revealed that GSTAurora-A but not GST could pull-down the recombinant ERα (Figure 4e). These data
indicate that Aurora-A directly binds to ERα. To determine if Aurora-A co-localizes with
ERα, we performed immunofluorescence staining in MCF7-TamR cells with anti-ERα and Aurora-A antibodies and we found that Aurora-A co-localized with ERα not only in the
nucleus but also in centrosome (Figure 4f). We next investigated if Aurora-A phosphorylates
ERα. In vitro Aurora-A kinase assay was performed by incubation of full-length human
recombinant ERα with and without recombinant Aurora-A. Figure 5a shows that ERα was
highly phosphorylated in the reaction containing Aurora-A. To determine if Aurora-A
phosphorylates ERα in vivo, MDA-MB-231 cells were co-transfected with Myc-ERα and
either HA-Aurora-A or vector. After labeling with [32P]-orthophosphate for 3 hours, ERα
was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and the immunoprecipitates were separated
in SDS-PAGE. Following exposure of an x-ray film, we observed that phosphorylation of
ERα was induced by Aurora-A (Figure 5b).

Author Manuscript

We further defined the amino acid(s) of ERα that is phosphorylated by Aurora-A. In vitro
Aurora-A kinase assay was carried out using GST fusion proteins containing different
portions of ERα as substrates (Figure S7a). Since ERα/1–200 and ERα/1–318 but not
ERα/1–150 were phosphorylated by Aurora-A, a potential phosphorylation site(s) was
mapped to the amino acid 150–318 region of ERα (Figure S7b). Mass spectrometry analysis
revealed serine-167 (Ser167), Ser212 and Ser305 as putative Aurora-A phosphorylation
sites. To verify if these 3 serine residues are phosphorylated by Aurora-A, we further created
3 different GST-ERα fusion proteins that contain Ser167, Ser212 or Ser305 and their serinealanine mutation S167A, S212A and S305A individually (Figure S7a). In vitro kinase assays
revealed that Aurora-A phosphorylated wild-type GST-ERα-S167, even it is not perfect
match with Aurora-A phosphorylation consensus motif,23 and -S305 but not GST-ERαS212, -S167A, and -S305A (Figure S7c). Furthermore, in vivo [32P]orthophosphate labeling
and Western blotting analysis revealed that Aurora-A phosphorylation of wild-type ERα but
not ERα-S167A/S305A (ERα-2A) mutant (Figures 5c and 5d), suggesting that Ser167 and
Ser305 of ERα are phosphorylated by Aurora-A. These findings were further confirmed by
immunoblotting of Aurora-A overexpressing MCF7 and Aurora-A knocking down BT474
cells (Figure 5e) as well as of cold in vitro Aurora-A kinase reaction (Figure S7d) using

specific phospho-ERα-Ser167 and -Ser305 antibodies. In addition, we observed that AuroraA inhibitor MLN8237 significantly inhibited p-ERα-Ser167/Ser305 levels in MCF7-TamR
and BT474 cells (Figures S8a and S8b) and the xenografts (Figure S8c). Based on these
findings, we conclude that ERα-Ser167 and -Ser305 are phosphorylated by Aurora-A in
vitro and in vivo.
Aurora-A-induced ERα transactivation activity and CCND1 expression via phosphorylation
of ERα-Ser167 and Ser305

Author Manuscript

Since Aurora-A induces ERα transactivation, we next investigated whether Aurora-Ainduced ERα activity depends on phosphorylation of ERα-Ser167 or/and Ser305. ERαnegative MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with wild-type ERα, ERα-S167A, ERαS305A or ERα-S167A/S305A (ERα-2A) together with ERE-Luc. Reporter assay showed
that expression of Aurora-A significantly induced wild-type ERα but not ERα-S167A/
S305A transactivation activity (Figure 6a). Furthermore, Aurora-A also stimulated ERαS167A- and ERα-S305A-induced ERE-Luc activity to a much lesser extent than wild-type
ERα (Figure 6a)

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Since CCND1 (cyclin D1) is a major target of ERα and overexpression of CCND1 has been
implicated in tamoxifen resistance,25, 26 we also examined whether Aurora-A induces
CCND1 expression and, if present, whether the induction depends on phosphorylation of
ERα-Ser167/SerS305. ERα-positive MCF7 and ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells were
transfected with Aurora-A. Following 72 hours of incubation, semi-quantitative RT-PCR
and immunoblot analyses revealed that mRNA and protein levels of CCND1 were induced
by Aurora-A in MCF7 but not in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 6b and Figure S9).
Furthermore, knockdown of Aurora-A decreased CCND1 expression in BT474 cells (Figure
6c), suggesting Aurora-A induction of CCND1 through ERα. To determine if Aurora-A
phosphorylation of ERα mediates this action, we expressed wild-type ERα, ERα-S167A/
S305A, ERα-S167A and ERα-S305A together with and without Aurora-A in MDAMB-231 cells. As shown in Figures 6d–f, co-expression of Aurora-A and wild-type ERα
significantly increased CCND1 protein and mRNA levels and ERα transactivation and
DNA-binding activity towards the CCND1 promoter. However, Aurora-A failed to exert
these effects when co-transfected with ERα-S167A/S305A. Expression of ERα-S167A or
ERα-S305A partially inhibited Aurora-A-induced CCND1 (Figure 6d and 6e). In addition,
we examined the relationship between Aurora A and CCND1 mRNA levels in patient
samples from GEO gene expression datasets and found the significant positive correlation of
Aurora-A with CCND1 expression in ERα-positive but not ERα-negative breast cancers
(Figure S10). Taken together, these data indicate that Aurora-A induces ERα and ERαtargeted gene CCND1 through phosphorylation of Ser167 and Ser305.
Upregulation of Aurora-A correlates with p-ERα-Ser167/Ser305, endocrine therapy
resistance and disease-free survival in ERα-positive breast cancer
Having demonstrated Aurora-A phosphorylation of ERα-Ser167/Ser305 in cells, we next
investigated if this event occurs in human breast tumour samples. Of the 167 ERα-positive
breast cancers examined by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot, 73 had
Aurora-A overexpression and 34 had elevated both p-ERα-Ser167 and p-ERα-Ser305

(Figures 7a–c and Table S1). Further, p-ERα-Ser167 and p-ERα-Ser305 were detected in 88
and 71 tumours, respectively, which include 34 cases with positive p-ERα-Ser167/Ser305
(Figure 7c). Of the 34 tumours with elevated levels of p-ERα-Ser167/Ser305, 32 (94.1%)
also had elevated Aurora-A (p < 0.00001; Figure 7d). The other 2 cases with elevated pERα-Ser167/Ser305 could be resulted from activation of other kinases (Figure 8). Further
analyses showed that Aurora-A expression level, p-ERα-Ser167 and p-ERα-Ser305 status
were not related to tumour size, lymph node metastasis, tumour stage and grade (Table S1).
However, p-ERα-Ser167/Ser305 and pERα-Ser167 alone, but not p-ERα-Ser305, are
significantly associated disease-free survival (DFS; Figure S11a–c and Table S2). All 32
patients with elevated Aurora-A and positive pERα-Ser167/Ser305 relapsed from
tamoxifen/nolvadex treatment and had poor DFS (Figure S11d). Notably, elevated levels of
Aurora-A were found to be significantly associated with DFS (Figure 7d and Table S2).

To further confirm these findings, we took advantage of the available gene expression
datasets summing up to 854 ERα-positive primary breast cancers with associated clinical
data, including endocrine therapy, disease recurrence and survival (Table S3). We defined
each dataset into two groups of tumours with respectively high and low level of expression
of Aurora-A (Figure S12). Strikingly, the univariate Kaplan-Merier survival analysis
revealed that the group expressing high levels of Aurora-A displayed a significant higher
probability to develop recurrence when compared to the “low” group (p values ranged from
0.0064 to 3E-01, depending on the datasets; Figure 7e, S12, S13 and Table S4). In addition,
the KM Plotter database (http://www.kmplot.com;24 analysis of breast cancers also showed
that Aurora-A levels were significantly associated with recurrence-free survival in ERαpositive breast cancers treated with endocrine therapy (Figure 7f and Table S5) but not in
ERα-negative and basal breast tumours (Figure S14 and Table S5). Since antiestrogen
therapy was used in ERα-positive tumours collected in these datasets, the recurrence largely
represents the resistance to endocrine therapy. Therefore, these data suggest that elevated
Aurora-A has significant implication in recurrence of ERα-positive breast cancers which are
mostly due to Aurora-A inducing endocrine therapy-resistance by phosphorylation of ERα.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Here we show that overexpression of Aurora-A sufficed to induce tamoxifen resistance,
whereas inhibition of Aurora-A by small molecule inhibitor MLN8237 or siRNA
knockdown overcame the resistance. Previous reports demonstrated that overexpression/
activation of Aurora-A is a recurrent event in human breast cancer.3 A recent study showed
that Aurora-A promotes distant metastases by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
in ERα-positive breast cancer cells,6 suggesting a link between Aurora-A and ERα, which
plays a critical role in disease progression in ERα-positive breast cancer. Our data showed
that Aurora-A directly interacted with ERα and phosphorylated ERα-Ser167/Ser305 in vitro
and in vivo (Figures 4 and 5). Co-existence of overexpression of Aurora-A and phosphoERα-Ser167/Ser305 was detected in tamoxifen resistance breast cancer cells and primary
tumours with poor prognosis (Figures 1, 7c and S11d). Furthermore, data mining analysis of
~2,400 breast cancers revealed that elevated Aurora-A was significantly associated with
short recurrence-free survival only in ERα-positive and antiestrogen-treated breast cancers
(Figures 7e, 7f and S12–S14, and Table S4 and S5). Thus, these findings indicate that ERα

is a bona fide substrate of Aurora-A and that elevated level of Aurora-A is a causal factor of
endocrine therapy-resistance and a valuable prognostic marker in ERα-positive breast
cancer.

Author Manuscript

Previous studies showed that at least 80% of tamoxifen resistant breast tumours retain ERα
expression11 and that phosphorylation of ERα by protein kinases is one of major
mechanisms that cause the resistance. Serine-167, which is located in the N-terminal
activation function 1 domain (AF-1) of ERα, has been shown to be phosphorylated by Akt,
S6K1, pp90rsk as well as IKBKE and the phosphorylation of Ser167 leads to increase of
ERα transactivation activity.27–30 In a small study based on tamoxifen-treated breast cancer
patients,31 the p-ERα-Ser167 was correlated with increased tamoxifen sensitivity,32 In
contrast, other results have indicated that the phosphorylation of ERα-Ser167 is linked to
reduce tamoxifen sensitivity.27, 28 In this study, our data show that p-ERα-Ser167 is
associated with poor prognosis (Figure S11b). Serine-305 is located in the hinge region of
ERα and the phosphorylation of this residue by PKA and PAK1 has been shown to result in
ERα transcriptional activation of its target genes.33, 34 In addition, phosphorylation of
Ser305 is correlated with tamoxifen resistance while it is not associated with DFS.33–37 We
showed that Aurora-A phosphorylates both Ser167 and Ser305 of ERα, which is
significantly related with short DFS (Figures 5, 7e S11a and S11d) and significantly induces
ERα transactivation activity and CCND1 expression (Figure 6). Mutation of Ser167 and
Ser305 to alanine abrogated the effect of Aurora-A on ERα activity and CCND1 expression
(Figure 6). Collectively, these data suggest that Aurora-A-induced ERα activation,
tamoxifen resistance and disease recurrence could be largely through phosphorylation of
Ser167 and Ser305 (Figure 8).

Author Manuscript

Aurora-A is a centrosome kinase, however, it has been shown to also phosphorylate the
molecules outside centrosome, including TRF1, RalA, p53, HDAC6 etc.38–41 Our data
showed that Aurora-A co-localized with ERα in both nucleus and centrosome (Figures 4f
and S15b). We also observed the co-localization of p-ERα-Ser167 and p-ERα-Ser305 with
Aurora-A in the centrosome (Figure S15a), implying that Aurora-A also phosphorylates
ERα within the centrosome. The function of ERα in the centrosome is currently unknown.
Further studies are required to characterize the role of ERα in Aurora-A-induced centrosome
amplification.

Author Manuscript

Finally, several small molecule inhibitors of Aurora kinases have been developed and are
currently undergoing preclinical and early clinical testing. In particular, MLN8237 is a
novel, orally bioavailable, second-generation selective inhibitor of Aurora-A. MLN8237 has
exhibited efficacy against solid tumours and hematologic malignancies in preclinical models
and are currently undergoing clinical evaluation in hematological and solid cancers.42, 43 In
this report, we showed that MLN8237 not only inhibited tamoxifen-resistance breast cancer
cell survival and tumour growth but also co-operated with tamoxifen in cell culture and
orthotopic breast cancer model (Figures 3 and S4). In addition, MLN8237 abrogated
Aurora-A phosphorylation of ERα-Ser167 and -Ser305 (Figure S8). These data underscore
the potential of MLN8237 as either an independent or concurrent agent in tamoxifenresistant breast cancer and the pERα-Ser167/Ser305 as potential clinical biomarkers in
Aurora-A inhibitor therapy.

were obtained from ATCC. MCF-7-TamR was generated by chronic low dose treatment
with tamoxifen.44 The cells were grown in RPMI-1640 or DMEM medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum or in phenol red-free DMEM with charcoal stripped serum.
Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) following the
manufacturer’s instruction. Frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded human primary
breast cancer and normal breast tissues were obtained from the Tissue Procurement Facility
at Moffitt Cancer Center under an approved IRB protocol.

Western Blot, Immunoprecipitation, Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Immunofluorescence Staining

Author Manuscript

Western blot, immunoprecipitation, IHC and immunofluorescence were performed as
previously described.45 Briefly, cell lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer and then
subjected to immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblots with antibodies indicated in the
Figure Legend. For IHC, breast cancer sections were immunostained with anti-Aurora-A
(1:200), -ERα (1:250) and -ERα-Ser167/Ser305 (1:200) antibodies. The expression of
Aurora-A and ERα was evaluated and scored as previously described.7 Immunofluorescence
staining was carried out by fixing cells with 10% formalin/10% methanol for 20 min, and
permeabilized in 1% NP-40 in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then blocked by 10%
normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with primary antibodies
against Aurora-A and ERα followed by secondary antibodies. The DNA was counterstained
with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.
Luciferase Reporter Assay
Cells were transiently transfected with EREα-Luc or CCND1-Luc, Aurora-A, wild-type or
mutant ERα and β-galactosidase. The amount of DNA in each transfection was kept
constant by the addition of empty pHM6 vector. After 48 hours of transfection, luciferase
activity was measured using a luciferase assay reagents (Promega). Luciferase activities

were normalized with respect to parallel β-galactosidase activities, to correct for differences
in transfection efficiency. β-galactosidase assays were performed using the β-Galactosidase
Enzyme Assay System (Promega).
Mass spectrometry, GST Pull-down, in vitro Kinase Assay and in vivo [32P]Pi Cell Labeling
Mass spectrometry was performed as previously described.27 Glutathione-Sepharose beads
coupled with recombinant GST-Aurora-A or GST, were incubated with recombinant ERα
(Abcam) in a binding buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1%
Triton-X-100) for 2 h at 4°C. After washing the beads three times with the binding buffer,
proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by 10% SDS–PAGE followed by
immunoblotting with ERα antibody.

Author Manuscript

In vitro Aurora-A kinase assay was performed by incubation of recombinant Aurora-A and
recombinant ERα, as a substrate, in an in vitro kinase buffer for 25 min and followed by
SDS–PAGE.18 For in vivo labeling, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with ERα and
together with and without HA-Aurora-A. After serum starvation overnight, cells were
labeled with [32P]Pi (0.5 mCi/ml) in phenol red-free MEM without phosphate for 4 hours.
ERα was immunoprecipitated and separated in SDS-PAGE. The phospho-ERα was detected
and quantified.
RT-PCR and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

Author Manuscript

RT-PCR and ChIP assays were performed as previously described.27 Primers are: ERα, 5′GGTGCCACCTGTGGTCCACCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′CTTCACTTGTGGCCCAGATAGG-3′ (antisense); GAPDH, 5′CATGTTCGTCATGGGTGTGAACCA-3′ (sense) and 5′AGTGATGGCATGGACTGTGGTCAT-3′ (antisense); CCND1, 5′GAACAGAAGTGCGAGAAGGAG-3′ (sense), and 5′AGGCGGTAGTAGGACAGGAAG-3′ (antisense). For ChIP assay, the primers for CCND1
were used as following: forward (−1039) AACAAAACCAATTAGGAACCTT, reverse
(−770) ATTTCCTTCATCTTGTCCTTCT. The PCR products were analyzed by
electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
Colony Formation, Cell Viability, Apoptosis Assays and Synergy Analysis
Colony formation, MTT and apoptotic assays were performed as previously described.28
Each experiment was repeated three times in triplicate. The results are expressed as the
enrichment factor relative to the untreated controls.

Author Manuscript

The synergistic effects of drug combinations were evaluated with Calcusyn software
(Biosoft). This software uses the Chou-Talalay combination index method, which is based
on the median–effect equation, itself a derivation from the mass-action law.46 For this
analysis, Drug1 was combined with Drug2 at a constant ratio determined by IC50 Drug1/
IC50 Drug2. We entered the resulting proliferation data, along with the data obtained from
single drug treatments, into Calcusyn to determine a combination index value (CI) for each
combination point, which quantitatively defines additivity (CI = 1.0), synergy (CI < 1.0),

and antagonism (CI > 1.0). The resulting values were used to construct a plot of CI values
over a range of fractions affected (FaCI plot).
Orthotopic Breast Cancer Mouse Model

Author Manuscript

Experimental procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use committee. Animal care was in accord with institution guidelines.
Cells (5 × 106) were injected into mammary fat pads of 6 weeks old female nude mice
(Charles River, Wilmington, MA). Tumour growth was monitored twice weekly by caliper
measurements (LxWxD). When the tumours reached the average size of 100 mm3, the mice
were divided into four groups, each with seven mice and an even distribution of tumour
sizes, and treated as follows. Tamoxifen (at a dose of 5 mg) and Aurora-A inhibitor
MLN8237 (at a dose of 30 mg/kg in a final formulation in 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-βcyclodextrin/1% sodium bicarbonate) were orally given alone and combination daily for 26
days. Control group was orally given 100 μL vehicle control daily.
Breast Cancer Datasets

Author Manuscript

To assess the relation of overexpression of Aurora-A with recurrence of ERα-positive breast
cancer treated with endocrine therapy, 674 ERα-positive breast cancers that were treated
with antiestrogen agents were analyzed in the KM Plotter database (http://www.kmplot.com;
Table S5). We also collected 4 different datasets from (Table S1). For each data set, we
performed survival analysis to test if the Aurora-A levels are associated with recurrence.
Each dataset has been processed independently from the other to preserve the original
differences among the various studies (e.g., patient cohort, microarray type, sample
processing protocol, etc.). We downloaded ERα-positive breast cancer gene expression
datasets with clinical information from Gene Expression Omnibus (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GEO/), or author’s individual web pages. Table S3 reports the
complete list of datasets and their sources. The datasets included both Affymetrix and dualchannel cDNA microarray platforms. When CEL files were available, expression values
were generated from intensity signals using the RMA algorithm; values have been
background adjusted, normalized using quantile normalization, and expression measure
calculated using median polish 7 summarization.
Statistic Analysis

Author Manuscript

Statistic significance of differences between groups was analyzed by unpaired Student’s t
test. The correlation of Aurora-A with ERα phosphorylation was examined by Chi-square.
Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using the Cox
proportional hazards model. Recurrence-free survival time was calculated as the time
between diagnosis and any of the events: locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, or
breast cancer death. Recurrence-free survival time distributions were compared with the logrank test and plots were drawn using the Kaplan-Meier technique. Multivariate analysis of
recurrence rates and breast cancer mortality rates was done with Cox proportional hazard
regression, a method also used for the interaction analysis of different factors. All analyses
were performed using the SPSS 11.5 Statistical Software, and p ≤ 0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.

Figure 7. Expression of Aurora-A correlates with p-ERa-Ser167/Ser305 and is associated with
recurrence-free survival

(A and B) Immunohistochemical staining (A) and immunoblot (B) analyses were performed
with indicated antibodies in ERα-positive human breast tumours. (C) Chi-square test
analysis of Aurora-A expression and p-ERα-Ser167/Ser305 in ERα-positive breast cancer
specimens. (D – F) Kaplan-Meier curves show the recurrence free-survival in ERα-positive
breast cancer patients from Moffitt Cancer Center patients (D), 4 breast cancer datasets (E)
and the KM Plotter database (F; note: there are 8 datasets in KM Plotter including 3 datasets
from panel E). The log-rank test p values reflect the significance of association between high
Aurora-A and shorter survival.
