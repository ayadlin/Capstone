Abstract
Abnormal centrosome and centriole numbers are frequently
detected in tumor cells where they can contribute to mitotic
aberrations that cause chromosome missegregation and
aneuploidy. The molecular mechanisms of centriole overduplication in malignant cells, however, are poorly characterized. Here, we show that the core SKP1-cullin-F-box
component cullin 1 (CUL1) localizes to maternal centrioles
and that CUL1 is critical for suppressing centriole overduplication through multiplication, a recently discovered
mechanism whereby multiple daughter centrioles form
concurrently at single maternal centrioles. We found that this
activity of CUL1 involves the degradation of Polo-like kinase 4
(PLK4) at maternal centrioles. PLK4 is required for centriole
duplication and strongly stimulates centriole multiplication
when aberrantly expressed. We found that CUL1 is critical for
the degradation of active PLK4 following deregulation of
cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity, as is frequently
observed in human cancer cells, as well as for baseline PLK4
protein stability. Collectively, our results suggest that CUL1
may function as a tumor suppressor by regulating PLK4
protein levels and thereby restraining excessive daughter
centriole formation at maternal centrioles. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Centrosomes function as major microtubule-organizing centers
in most mammalian cells (1). The single centrosome of a nondividing cell consists of a pair of centrioles, short microtubule
cylinders, surrounded by pericentriolar material. To organize a
bipolar mitotic spindle, the centrosome duplicates precisely once
before mitosis (2). This process is frequently disrupted in tumor
cells, where centrosome overduplication has been implicated in
mitotic defects, chromosome missegregation, and aneuploidy (3–6).
Supernumerary centrosome numbers may arise as a consequence of mitotic defects that lead to the formation of tetraploid
and/or binucleated cells that will contain four centrosomes if they
reenter the cell division cycle. Although tetraploidy has been
implicated as a gateway to aneuploidy, it is a remarkably stable
cellular state, suggesting that additional mutations are necessary

that cause chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy (7).
Importantly, however, some oncogenic events, for example, the
human papillomavirus-16 (HPV-16) E7 oncoprotein (8), directly
interfere with the process of centriole synthesis resulting in the
formation of multiple daughter centrioles from a single maternal
centriole during a single round of cell division as was originally
postulated by Boveri (9).
The duplication of the centrosome is initiated by the disengagement of the two centrioles (10). This is followed by activation of
Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) and the subsequent recruitment of hSAS-6
and other centriolar components to maternal centrioles, which are
critical steps in procentriole assembly (11–13).
During a normal centriole duplication cycle, a single maternal
centriole generates one and only one daughter centriole. However,
recent studies have revealed that single maternal centrioles have
the ability to mediate the concurrent formation of multiple
daughter centrioles at the same time (centriole multiplication).
The structures that arise during this process, a single maternal
centriole surrounded by a ring of concurrently synthesized
daughters, have been called centriole flowers (8, 12). Besides
overexpression of PLK4 or hSAS-6 (12–15), inhibition of the
proteasome (8), overexpression of the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein (8),
and inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 in Drosophila
wing disc cells (16) have been reported to stimulate the formation
of multiple daughters at single maternal centrioles. In addition, the
centriolar pathway of basal body production in oviduct cells has
also been shown to involve the concurrent formation of multiple
daughter centrioles (17, 18).
Given the intrinsic potential of maternal centrioles to give birth
to multiple daughters, the question arises what the molecular
mechanisms that normally restrain procentriole formation to only
one per cell division cycle may be.
The centrosome has been shown to harbor components of the
ubiquitin-proteasome machinery including subunits of SKP1-cullinF-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligases and components of the 26S
proteasome (19–22). Although SCF complexes have been implicated
in centriole duplication control as well as centriole separation
(19, 23), their precise functions are not understood in detail.
Here, we show that the SCF core component, cullin 1 (CUL1),
localizes to maternal centrioles and that these centrioles serve as
assembly platforms for oncogene-induced centriole overduplication. Moreover, SCF ubiquitin ligase activity was found to be
critically involved in suppressing centriole multiplication in human
tumor cells by regulating PLK4 protein levels. We provide evidence
that SCF ubiquitin ligase activity is critical for the degradation
of active PLK4 following overexpression of cyclin E/CDK2 as well
as for baseline PLK4 protein stability. Our results suggest that
SCF ubiquitin ligase activity provides an important mechanism
for restraining excessive daughter centriole formation at single

maternal centrioles and hence centrosome-mediated cell division
errors and chromosomal instability. Because recurrent deletions of
the CUL1 locus on chromosome 7q36.1 have been detected in
human malignancies, our findings provide insights into possible
tumor suppressor activities of CUL1.

proteasome inhibitor Z-L3VS (Biomol) or 0.1% DMSO as control. To inhibit
CDK activity, cells were treated with 1 Amol/L indirubin-3¶-oxime (kindly

immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of the SCF core
component CUL1 was done using U-2 OS cells stably expressing
centrin-GFP. CUL1 was found to localize to centrioles (Fig. 1A),
whereas weaker CUL1 staining was detected in the nucleus and
occasionally in the cytoplasm of cells as reported previously (28).
The colocalization pattern between centrin-GFP and CUL1
suggested that CUL1 may be present at older, mature centrioles
(Fig. 1A). A coimmunofluorescence microscopic analysis of CUL1
and CEP170, a marker for mature maternal centrioles (29), in U-2
OS/centrin-GFP cells revealed that CUL1 in fact localizes to older,
maternal centrioles (Fig. 1B).
Overexpression of the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein has been shown
previously to lead to excessive daughter centriole formation at
maternal centrioles (8, 30). U-2 OS/centrin-GFP cells were
transiently transfected with HPV-16 E7 or other oncogenes
including c-MYC or the transcription factor E2F-1 followed by
immunofluorescence staining for CUL1. Because normal centriole
duplication generates a maximum of two mature maternal
centrioles and a maximum of two immature daughters, excessive

numbers of CUL1-negative centrioles in the presence of one or
two CUL1-positive centrioles were counted as abnormal. An
increase of cells with more than four centrioles in the presence of
only one or two CUL1-positive centrioles was detected in cells
overexpressing c-MYC (6.7%), HPV-16 E7 (10.7%; P V 0.05), or
E2F-1 (13%; P V 0.005) in comparison with empty vector control
(3%; Fig. 1C, D).
These results indicate that the SCF ubiquitin ligase component
CUL1 localizes to maternal centrioles that serve as assembly
platforms for excessive daughter centriole formation induced by
various oncogenic stimuli.
Inhibition of SCF ubiquitin ligase activity causes centriole
multiplication. To determine the role of CUL1 in the control of
centriole biogenesis, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to
deplete cells of CUL1 and a dominant-negative mutant of CUL1
(DN-CUL1), which has recently been shown to effectively reduce
CUL1-based SCF activity (31). siRNA-mediated knockdown of CUL1
led to centriole multiplication with an increase of cells showing
multiple daughter centrioles at single maternal centrioles (Fig. 2A)

from 0.6% in controls to 8.5% in CUL1-depleted cells (P V 0.05;
Fig. 2B, left). Centriole multiplication was also detected in cells
transiently transfected with DN-CUL1 with an increase from 1.3%
in controls to 12% in DN-CUL1–transfected cells (P V 0.05; Fig. 2B,
right).
CUL1 is involved in the degradation of several critical cell cycle
regulators including cyclin E (32, 33). In line with this notion, we
detected an increase of cyclin E protein expression in U-2 OS/
centrin-GFP cells transfected with either siRNA against CUL1 or
DN-CUL1 (Fig. 2C).
These results suggest that cyclin E may contribute to centriole
multiplication induced by inhibition of CUL1. However, when
cyclin E together with its kinase subunit CDK2 was overexpressed
in U-2 OS/centrin-GFP cells, no significant increase of cells with
centriole multiplication was detected (Fig. 3A). Only when cyclin
E/CDK2 complexes were coexpressed with increasing amounts of
the centrosomal kinase PLK4, a significant increase of cells with
centriole multiplication was detected (Fig. 3A and B). Coexpression
of PLK4 together with cyclin E/CDK2 consistently led to a higher
frequency of centriole multiplication than overexpression of PLK4
alone (Fig. 3A).
We therefore asked next whether cyclin E/CDK2 complexes can
alter the expression of PLK4 at centrioles. To test this idea, U-2 OS/
centrin-GFP cells were transiently transfected with cyclin E and
CDK2 followed by immunofluorescence microscopy for endogenous PLK4 protein (Fig. 3C). In empty vector–transfected control

www.aacrjournals.org

cells, disengaged centrioles or duplicated centrioles were associated with a single dot of endogenous PLK4 that typically localized
to the site of daughter centriole synthesis at the wall of the
maternal centriole (Fig. 3C, control). In cells ectopically expressing
cyclin E/CDK2, an increased proportion of cells with two or more
dots of endogenous PLK4 at single mothers was detected (Fig. 3C,
cyclin E/CDK2). These aberrant PLK4 dots were occasionally found
to precede the formation of centrin-containing procentrioles
(Fig. 3C, bottom), which is in line with previous results suggesting
that PLK4 functions early during daughter centriole synthesis (12).
Aberrant PLK4 dots at maternal centrioles were detected in 28 of
52 (53.8%) cells transfected with cyclin E/CDK2 in comparison with
10 of 51 (19.6%) cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 3D).
Overexpression of cyclin E/CDK2 also triggered an aberrant
expression of endogenous PLK4 in nontransformed human cells
with 14 of 28 (50%) BJ/TERT/centrin-GFP fibroblasts transfected
with cyclin E/CDK2 showing aberrant dots of endogenous PLK4
at maternal centrioles in comparison with 7 of 28 (25%) empty
vector–transfected cells (Fig. 3D).
Taken together, these results suggest that the centriole
multiplication induced by inhibition of CUL1 cannot solely be
explained by an accumulation of cyclin E but depends also on
increased levels of PLK4.
PLK4 is degraded by the proteasome. Our findings that cyclin
E/CDK2 complexes cause an aberrant recruitment of PLK4 to
maternal centrioles but do not lead to centriole multiplication

unless PLK4 is overexpressed suggest that PLK4 levels are ratelimiting for excessive daughter centriole assembly. To explore how
PLK4 protein expression may be regulated, we first analyzed U-2
OS/centrin-GFP cells ectopically expressing PLK4 and treated with
the proteasome inhibitor Z-L3VS, which readily stimulates
centriole multiplication (8). Immunoblot analyses revealed a
stabilization of ectopically expressed PLK4, together with cyclin
E, in Z-L3VS–treated cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, Z-L3VS treatment
led to an excessive amount of endogenous PLK4 at maternal
centrioles. (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that PLK4 protein levels
are, at least in part, regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome
machinery. Furthermore, the effectiveness of Z-L3VS to stimulate
centriole multiplication may be based on the fact that both, cyclin
E and PLK4, are stabilized.
Cyclin E/CDK2 can destabilize PLK4. To explore why cyclin
E/CDK2 can only promote centriole multiplication in the presence
of excessive amounts of PLK4, PLK4 protein levels were
determined by immunoblotting after ectopic expression of Myctagged PLK4 alone or in combination with cyclin E and/or CDK2
(Fig. 5). Surprisingly, we detected a reduction of PLK4 protein levels
in the presence of ectopically expressed cyclin E or cyclin E/CDK2
(Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained when we analyzed wholecell extracts obtained from cells transfected with cyclin E/CDK2
and increasing amounts of PLK4 (Supplementary Material) and
these findings could also be reproduced in HeLa cells (not shown).

In contrast to wild-type PLK4, protein levels of catalytically
inactive mutant PLK4 D154A (14) were not significantly decreased
in the presence of ectopically expressed cyclin E/CDK2 (Fig. 5A).
Because PLK4 D154A mutant has no apparent defect in its
localization to centrioles (14), we interpret this finding as evidence
that the degradation of PLK4 depends on its kinase activity. Similar
results have been reported for other protein kinases such as SRC
(34). The decrease of PLK4 protein levels in the presence of cyclin
E/CDK2 was due to decreased protein stability as shown by a
cycloheximide block experiment (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, inhibition
of CDK activity using the small-molecule inhibitor indirubin-3¶oxime led to a stabilization of PLK4 protein underscoring the CDK
dependency of this process (Fig. 5C).

CUL1 and Centriole Multiplication

cells after transient transfection with empty vectors (control) or DN-CUL1 for 48 h followed by transfection with Myc-PLK4 for 24 h and treatment with 30 Ag/mL
cycloheximide for the indicated time intervals. Note the increased protein stability of Myc-PLK4 in the presence of DN-CUL1 (6 h cycloheximide; lane 4 ). D, tentative
model of centriole multiplication triggered by oncogenic stimuli such as c-MYC, E2F-1, or HPV-16 E7. These stimuli are known to deregulate cyclin E/CDK2
complexes and we show here that this leads to an aberrant recruitment of PLK4 to maternal centrioles. However, degradation of enzymatically active PLK4 (and low
baseline protein expression) by CUL1-based SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase activity prevents the formation of supernumerary daughter centrioles. Only when PLK4 is
overexpressed or its CUL1-mediated degradation is altered that centriole multiplication occurs. Hence, it is likely that oncogene-induced centriole multiplication, for
example by HPV-16 E7, also involves impairment of CUL1-mediated protein degradation through mechanisms that remain to be determined. Genetic alterations such
as deletion of the CUL1 locus in certain human malignancies are likewise to promote centriole duplication.

Taken together, these findings suggest cyclin E/CDK2 promote
the aberrant recruitment of PLK4 to maternal centrioles followed
by its degradation that depends on PLK4 kinase activity. This
process may prevent the accumulation of active PLK4 at maternal
centrioles at levels that may promote aberrant procentriole
assembly. Our finding that additional dots of endogenous PLK4
at maternal centrioles are often smaller in size and weaker in signal
intensity than normal endogenous PLK4 dots (Fig. 3C) may lend
support to this notion.
CUL1 regulates PLK4 protein stability. We next asked whether
CUL1 contributes to the regulation of PLK4 protein levels. Ectopic
expression of DN-CUL1 caused an excess of endogenous PLK4 at

www.aacrjournals.org

maternal centrioles (Fig. 6A, left) that was phenotypically similar to
PLK4 accumulation in response to Z-L3VS–associated inhibition
of proteasomal PLK4 degradation. To assess this increase, the
integrated density of PLK4 signals at maternal centrioles was
quantified using ImageJ and expressed in arbitrary units (Fig. 6A,
right). A 6.9-fold increase of endogenous PLK4 protein was detected
in cells with centriole multiplication after transient transfection
with DN-CUL1 after normalization for endogenous PLK4 expression
in empty vector–transfected controls and formation of only a single
daughter. Treatment of cells with the CDK inhibitor indirubin-3¶oxime led only to a modest 1.3-fold increase of endogenous PLK4
in comparison with DMSO-treated control cells (Fig. 6A, right).

We tested next the effects of DN-CUL1 on cyclin E/CDK2induced PLK4 degradation. Using immunoblotting, we found that
DN-CUL1 abrogates the reduction of PLK4 protein levels associated
with ectopic expression of cyclin E/CDK2 (Fig. 6B). DN-CUL1 also
increased the baseline protein stability of ectopically expressed
PLK4 in the absence of overexpressed cyclin E/CDK2 (Fig. 6C).
Depletion of CUL1 by siRNA led to similar results (not shown).
Taken together, these results suggest that CUL1 is involved in
both cyclin E/CDK2-associated degradation of PLK4 and baseline
PLK4 protein stability.

Discussion
Results presented here show that the core SCF ubiquitin ligase
component CUL1 is critical to tightly regulate PLK4 proteins levels
to suppress aberrant centriole biogenesis at maternal centrioles.
Up-regulation of PLK4 expression is a strong stimulus for
centriole multiplication (8, 12, 15, 35). The fact that overexpression
of cyclin E/CDK2 can aberrantly recruit PLK4 to maternal
centrioles (Fig. 3C) provides mechanistic insight into how CDK2
and PLK4 may cooperate to stimulate excessive daughter centriole
formation (8, 14). Our finding that overexpression of cyclin E/CDK2
leads to the degradation of PLK4 in a manner that depends on
PLK4 kinase activity explains why overexpression of cyclin E/CKD2
alone is not sufficient to trigger centriole multiplication. The low
endogenous levels of PLK4 together with the degradation of active
PLK4 likely represent cellular failsafe mechanisms to limit normal
centriole biogenesis to one per cell division cycle.
Several lines of evidence indicate that active protein kinases can
be rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery,
whereas kinase-inactive mutants are more stable (34). Although
the precise molecular mechanisms that render active kinases more
susceptible to degradation are currently unknown, it has been
suggested that the switch from an inactive to an active state is
associated with a change in the conformation of the protein, as
well as phosphorylation events, which promotes its ubiquitination
and subsequent degradation. We will address this question for
PLK4 in future experiments.
PLK4 has been shown to autophosphorylate (36), but no specific
amino acid residues have been identified. It is known from other
protein kinases (e.g., CHK2; ref. 37) that autophosphorylation is
required for interaction with CUL1 and its degradation. It is hence
possible that autophosphorylation of PLK4 plays a role in its
degradation.
We were not able to unambiguously detect a direct interaction
between CDK2 and PLK4 by coimmunoprecipitation (data not
shown). This does not rule out a very weak and/or transient
interaction. Our results are consistent with a model whereby high
levels of cyclin E/CDK2 complexes cause an aberrant recruitment
of PLK4 to centrioles through an indirect mechanism that remains
to be identified. The fact that mutant PLK4 D154A is more stable
than wild-type PLK4 in the presence of overexpressed cyclin
E/CDK2 but has no centrosomal localization defect (14) suggests
that it is the enzymatic activity of PLK4 and not only its
centrosome association that triggers its degradation. One possibility is that cyclin E/CDK2 complexes phosphorylate a centrosomal
protein that mediates the recruitment of PLK4 followed by its
activation and subsequent degradation. It has been suggested,
however, that the single Polo box of PLK4 reduces its ability to
efficiently recognize phosphopeptides (38). PLK4 is protected from
PEST-dependent proteolysis by the protein tyrosine kinase Tec (39).
One possible mechanism hence may be that Tec activity is

modulated by CDK2, which may then lead to an accumulation
of active PLK4 at the centrosome. Tec contains a consensus
S/T-PxK/R CDK2 phosphorylation motif and we will follow up on
this interesting possibility in future experiments. Whether any of
the centrosomal CDK2 targets such as nucleophosmin, CP110, or
MPS1 play a role in this process remains to be determined (40–43).
The question whether normal activation of cyclin E/CDK2
complexes triggers PLK4 recruitment during normal centriole
duplication also awaits further clarification. It is interesting to note,
however, that CDK2-deficient MEFs cells have no detectable defects
in centrosomal duplication (44). Oncogene-triggered centrosome
overduplication, however, was clearly blocked in CDK2-deficient
cells (44), suggesting that deregulation of CDK2, as frequently seen
in tumors through increased cyclin E expression, may promote
centriole overduplication by aberrantly recruiting PLK4. One
prediction from our results is that such tumor cells may also
harbor alterations of the PLK4 degradation machinery. Oncogenic
stimuli that induce centriole overduplication may therefore not
only function by deregulating cyclin E/CDK2 activity but also by
impacting on CUL1-based SCF ubiquitin ligase activity (Fig. 6D).
PLK4 contains a consensus DSGxxS/T phosphodegron, which has
been linked to SCFh-TrCP–mediated degradation. Two recent studies
in Drosophila cells have shown a role of the SCFSlimb ubiquitin ligase
in the regulation of SAK (PLK4; refs. 15, 35). Slimb is the orthologue
of the mammalian F-box protein h-TrCP, and although knockout
of h-TrCP in mice has been found to lead to centrosome
amplification (45), our own experiments did not show significant
centriole multiplication after siRNA-mediated knockdown of
h-TrCP in human U-2 OS cells (data not shown). Our finding does
not preclude a role of SCFh-TrCP in PLK4 regulation in human cells,
but it raises the interesting possibility that there may be cell type–
specific differences in PLK4 regulation and/or that more than one
F-box protein participates in SCF-mediated regulation of PLK4
stability in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. Given the need to
tightly regulate PLK4 levels, it is likely that multiple mechanisms
converge on PLK4 expression control and protein stability.
The CUL1 locus on chromosome 7q36 has been found to be
recurrently deleted in several human malignancies including acute
myeloid leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes (46). Such
malignancies are characterized by centrosome aberrations and
genomic instability (47) and our results suggest that the activity of
CUL1 to suppress centriole multiplication may play an important
role in its function as a putative tumor suppressor (Fig. 6D).
Another prominent example of centrosome amplification associated with the loss of a tumor suppressor that has E3 ubiquitin
ligase activity is BRCA1 (48). It is likely that more proteins involved
in restraining centriole overduplication through targeted degradation remain to be discovered.
Our findings provide a framework for future studies to dissect
molecular interactions and post-translational modifications that will
add layers of complexity to the SCF/CUL1-based regulatory circuitry
that restrains daughter centriole biogenesis at maternal centrioles.
