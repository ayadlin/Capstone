In Brief
López-Garcı́a et al. find that BCL9L is
often genetically inactivated in human
colorectal cancers with chromosomal
instability. BCL9L dysfunction promotes
aneuploidy tolerance by reducing basal
caspase-2 levels and preventing
cleavage of MDM2 and BID independent
of TP53 mutation status.

SUMMARY

Chromosomal instability (CIN) contributes to cancer evolution, intratumor heterogeneity, and drug resistance. CIN is driven by chromosome segregation errors and a tolerance phenotype that permits the propagation of aneuploid genomes. Through genomic analysis of colorectal cancers and cell lines, we find frequent
loss of heterozygosity and mutations in BCL9L in aneuploid tumors. BCL9L deficiency promoted tolerance of
chromosome missegregation events, propagation of aneuploidy, and genetic heterogeneity in xenograft
models likely through modulation of Wnt signaling. We find that BCL9L dysfunction contributes to aneuploidy
tolerance in both TP53-WT and mutant cells by reducing basal caspase-2 levels and preventing cleavage of
MDM2 and BID. Efforts to exploit aneuploidy tolerance mechanisms and the BCL9L/caspase-2/BID axis may
limit cancer diversity and evolution.

INTRODUCTION
Emerging evidence supports the influence of intratumor heterogeneity on patient outcome and drug response (Ding et al., 2012;
Landau et al., 2013; Szerlip et al., 2012). Genomic instability
is frequently observed in cancer (Lengauer et al., 1998; Negrini
et al., 2010), driving intercellular variation and subsequent intra-

tumor heterogeneity, providing the substrate for selection and
tumor evolution (Boutros et al., 2015; Desmedt et al., 2015; Yates
et al., 2015).
Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a form of genome instability
characterized by the ongoing disorder of chromosome number
and/or structure. Numerical CIN occurs after whole chromosome missegregation due to mitotic defects (Bakhoum et al.,

Significance
This comprehensive genomic analysis of aneuploid colorectal cancer identified frequent mutations and deletions of BCL9L
leading to caspase-2 dysfunction and the tolerance of chromosome missegregation, which operates independently of TP53
status. These data support the existence of parallel pathways complementing TP53 dysfunction in the tolerance of aneuploidy and the central role for caspase-2 in the stabilization of p53 following chromosome missegregation events.

in an aberrant chromosome number, known as aneuploidy.
Structural CIN results in the disordered integrity of parts of chromosomes. Both types of CIN are interconnected: missegregated
chromosomes are exposed to mitotic stress that generates
structural CIN (Crasta et al., 2012; Janssen et al., 2011) while
changes in chromosome structure render them susceptible to
missegregation (Burrell et al., 2013; Chan et al., 2007; Kawabata
et al., 2011; Pampalona et al., 2010).
Since chromosome segregation errors are poorly tolerated by
diploid cells (Dewhurst et al., 2014; Iwanaga et al., 2007; Thompson and Compton, 2008, 2010), survival mechanisms, termed
aneuploidy tolerance, are crucial for the propagation of aneuploidy in tumors. Mutations in TP53 (Grim et al., 2012; Li et al.,
2010; Thompson and Compton, 2010) and buffering of protein
changes due to aneuploidy (Stingele et al., 2013; Torres et al.,
2010) have been proposed as candidate mechanisms of aneuploidy tolerance. Due to the potential clinical benefit of limiting
CIN in tumors, further efforts to elucidate these survival mechanisms might contribute to limiting this driver of heterogeneity.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) can be broadly divided into microsatellite-instability high (MSI, 20%) and microsatellite-stable
tumors (MSS, 80%). MSI CRC tumors remain near diploid,
whereas MSS tumors develop a wide range of aneuploid karyotypes and CIN (Bogaert and Prenen, 2014; Cancer Genome Atlas
Network, 2012; Mouradov et al., 2013; Rowan et al., 2005). TP53
mutations occur frequently in aneuploid tumors (Cianchi et al.,
1999; Rowan et al., 2005; Tang et al., 2004); however, next-generation sequencing efforts have not specifically explored the
80 Cancer Cell 31, 79–93, January 9, 2017

somatic mutational landscapes of aneuploid versus diploid
MSS CRC tumors to identify determinants of CIN.
In this study, we aimed to identify somatic mutations enriched
in aneuploid CRC and to elucidate the potential role of these
mutations in the development of CIN in CRC.
RESULTS
Somatic Mutation Analysis in CIN Colorectal Cancer
Genomes
We selected a cohort of 17 MSS colorectal adenocarcinomas
and eight MSS aneuploid cell lines (see Table S1 for clinical features) for whole-exome sequencing. Ploidy status was deduced
by calculation of the DNA index (DI) using DNA image cytometry
data obtained from nuclei isolated from paraffin-embedded
specimens (Table 1 and Figure S1). DI was calculated as the ratio
between the mode of the relative DNA content of observable
tumor nuclei peaks and a diploid control consisting of nuclei
from infiltrated fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells.
To validate the DNA image cytometry results, we performed
centromeric fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for chromosomes 2 and 15 (Table 1), since these chromosomes are not
frequently subject to whole chromosome gains or losses in
CRC (Orsetti et al., 2014). The overall distribution of centromeric
signals in tumor cells was compared with the normal adjacent
tissue (Table 1; Figures S2A and S2B). By convention, a tumor
was classified as aneuploid when an aneuploid peak was detected by DNA image cytometry (DI between 1.1 and 1.89 or
greater than 2.1) or when significant changes in the distribution

of centromeric signals were detected for one of the chromosomes tested. A tumor was classified as diploid when no aneuploid populations were detected by DNA image cytometry (only
one peak with DI = 1) and no significant changes were detected
in the distribution of centromeric signals for the two chromosomes tested. We detected modal chromosome signals different
from 2 for at least one chromosome in samples with aneuploid
peaks (Table 1). For the MSS cell lines, ploidy status was obtained from published karyotyping and SNP array analysis (Table
2, Gaasenbeek et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2011).
Aneuploid CRC is strongly associated with CIN defined
by cell-to-cell variation of centromeric signals and surrogate
parameters that measure karyotypic complexity in cancer genomes such as the weighted genome instability index (wGII),
which assesses the fraction of the genome with alterations (Burrell et al., 2013; Chin et al., 2007). We observed that both modal
centromere deviation (MCD) for chromosomes 2 and 15 and the
wGII were significantly higher in aneuploid tumors (Figures S2C
and S2D). In samples with DI = 1, the modal centromere signal
was 2 in all cases except tumor 395, which showed significant
alterations in the overall distribution of chromosome 15 signals
and was therefore classified as aneuploid (Table 1 and Figure S2E). This classification was also supported by a high wGII
(0.41). No significant differences were observed in tumor sample
purity between aneuploid and diploid tumors (Table 1 and Figure S2F). Taken together, ten MSS tumors were classified as
aneuploid and seven as diploid (Table 1).
To attempt to identify aneuploidy-specific mutations, we
performed exome sequencing on DNA from tumors, normal adjacent tissue, and cell lines (Table S2), and mutation calling of tumor
somatic variants was performed by filtering germline variants identified in normal adjacent colon. Manual curation of variant calls and
validation by Sanger sequencing revealed a list of 32 genes specifically mutated in aneuploid samples (Figure 1A and Table S3).
Notably, known CRC drivers (APC, FBXW7, and KRAS) did not
segregate according to tumor ploidy status. As expected, however, TP53 mutations were significantly enriched in aneuploid tumors (Figure 1A, 13/18 aneuploid tumors and cell lines, 0/7 diploid
samples; p = 0.001, Fisher’s exact test). No somatic mutations
were mutually exclusive with TP53 in this discovery cohort.
BCL9L was the only gene for which all mutations found were
clearly inactivating, with one nonsense mutation Q713* in tumor
379, one nonsense mutation R716* in the cell line SW1463, and

one splice-site variant (exon 5 + 1 G > A) in the tumor sample 363.
We also found loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the BCL9L locus in
two aneuploid tumors (391 and 389) and one cell line (SK-CO-1).
R716* was observed in two of four alleles of the aneuploid cell
line SW1463. Q713* and the splice-site mutation were observed
in two of three alleles of tumor samples 379 and 363, respectively, which suggests that BCL9L mutations occurred early,
prior to chromosome duplication.
Next, we performed two functional RNAi screens probing
phenotypes relevant to chromosome segregation errors and
their tolerance. We used the diploid cell line HCT-116 due to
its low level of constitutive chromosome segregation errors relative to CIN CRC cell lines and its poor tolerance of drug-induced
segregation errors (Gascoigne and Taylor., 2008; Lengauer et al.,
1997; Thompson and Compton, 2010). In the first RNAi screen
we silenced each of the 32 genes mutated in aneuploid samples
and examined the consequence upon chromosome segregation
error frequency as previously described (Burrell et al., 2013), with
no significant results. Second, we performed a screen to detect
tolerance of chromosome segregation errors. Chromosome missegregation induces p53-mediated cell cycle arrest in the next
G1 phase, often followed by apoptosis, thereby preventing propagation of aneuploid progeny (Figure S3A; see also Hinchcliffe
et al., 2016). Chromosome missegregation can be artificially
induced in HCT-116 cells with reversine, an Mps1 inhibitor that
impairs the spindle assembly checkpoint resulting in chromosomal non-disjunction and missegregation. Consistent with results by Jemaa et al. (2012), we found that reversine treatment
induces subsequent arrest or cell death (Figure S3A). We
depleted all aneuploid-specific genes (Figure 1A) individually in
HCT-116 cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) pools from
Dharmacon in the presence or absence of 250 nM reversine, a
concentration that does not inhibit Aurora kinase B (Santaguida
et al., 2010). Silencing of TP53, RABGAP1, BCL9L, HDLBP, and
ZFHX3 induced reversine tolerance (Figure 1A, right). We considered a gene validated when at least three of four individual oligonucleotides (components of the pool of four) showed the same
effect as the pool. TP53, BCL9L, and ZFHX3 were validated
following these criteria (Figure S3B). Experiments with distinct
Qiagen siRNA pools also showed a similar result for TP53,
BCL9L, and ZFHX3 (Figure S3B).
Efficient depletion of the BCL9L protein was observed for all
four single oligonucleotides (Figure S3C); however, we discarded the BCL9L oligonucleotide 4 due to high cellular toxicity.
Finally, expression of a BCL9L-EGFP construct lacking the
30 UTR region reverted the survival phenotype in reversine
when an siRNA targeting 30 UTR was transfected, further supporting that aneuploidy tolerance observed with various siRNA
duplexes is due to on-target silencing of BCL9L (Figure S3D).
BCL9L silencing also increased cell viability following treatment
with 200 nM aphidicolin (Figure S3E), which causes replication
stress and induces segregation errors of structurally unstable
chromosomes (Burrell et al., 2013). No tolerance effect was
observed when HCT-116 cells were treated with doxorubicin,
suggesting that silencing of BCL9L does not result in general
resistance to cytotoxics causing DNA damage (Figure S3F).
Given the aneuploid-specific pattern of LOH and truncating
events of BCL9L, the second most commonly truncated gene
in aneuploid CRC after TP53 in our discovery cohort (Figure 1A

and Table S3), and its putative aneuploidy tolerance function in
the siRNA screen, we investigated BCL9L somatic events in independent cohorts. We analyzed data from 186 MSS CRCs
available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Cancer
Genome Atlas Network, 2012). ZFHX3 was not investigated
further as mutations in this gene were not enriched in aneuploid
CRC in validation cohorts.
We confirmed that samples with somatic copy-number loss of
BCL9L had significantly lower gene expression compared with
samples with no alterations in BCL9L (Figure 1B). Using the
wGII score as a surrogate of chromosomal instability and aneuploidy in CRC as previously described (Chin et al., 2007; Lee
et al., 2011), we observed significantly higher wGII scores in tumors harboring BCL9L mutation or copy-number loss compared
with tumors with no alteration in BCL9L (Figure 1C). This relationship remained significant when controlling for the higher probability of gene loss in high-wGII tumors (Figure S3G, p = 0.03).
The majority of BCL9L deletions and mutations co-occurred
with TP53 mutations (21/26 tumors with co-occurrence, Figure 1D). In a similar computational permutation analysis as performed above (Figures 1C and S3G), samples with co-occurring
BCL9L and TP53 alterations displayed higher wGII scores
compared with those with mutually exclusive alterations (Figure 1E, p = 0.007), suggesting that these two genes might cooperate as aneuploidy suppressors in CRC.
Comprehensive genomic analysis from the same colorectal
TCGA cohort enabled us to infer the genotype of BCL9L alterations in MSS CRC (Figure 1F). In total, BCL9L mutations and/or
deletions occurred in 14% of MSS CRC (26/186, 5 mutations
and 21 deletions), the majority of which (23/26) retained a wildtype (WT) copy of BCL9L while biallelic alterations of BCL9L
occurred in only three samples. Taken together, these results suggest a haploinsufficient model of tumor suppression for BCL9L.
Finally, we evaluated the pattern of BCL9L non-synonymous
mutations in MSS CRC across the BCL9L protein (Figure 1G).
We compiled all BCL9L mutation data from the discovery cohort
in Figure 1A, the TCGA MSS CRC cohort, a large cohort of 438
MSS CRC published by Giannakis et al. (2016) together with
two additional validation cohorts of MSS CRC tumors sequenced
by Ion Torrent targeted sequencing (Figure S3H). The 27 BCL9L
somatic mutations identified were scattered across the gene
with one cluster of four missense mutations mapping to two adjacent residues within the b-catenin binding HD2 domain (R409W
and S410F). Thirty-seven percent (10/27) of the somatic mutations were truncating events (nonsense, splice-site, and indel mutations) whereas 17 of 27 were missense mutations (see Table S4
for functional impact). This characteristic profile of scattered mutations with >20% of inactivating/truncating mutations is consistent with the tumor-suppressor pattern proposed by Vogelstein
et al. (2013). Consistent with these data, comprehensive computational analysis has classified BCL9L as a candidate driver gene
in a pan-cancer analysis (Tamborero et al., 2013) and as a significantly mutated driver gene in MSS CRC (Giannakis et al., 2016).

Loss of BCL9L Drives Tolerance to Segregation Errors
and Aneuploidy
The results shown above prompted us to carry out a more
detailed study of the role of BCL9L dysfunction in aneuploidy
tolerance. The diploid cell line HCT-116 expresses high levels
of BCL9L, and siRNA transfection efficiently depleted BCL9L
protein and mRNA (Figure 2A). BCL9L silencing increased the
number of metabolically active cells, total cell number, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-incorporating cells, and colony-forming efficiency in reversine-treated HCT-116 cells (Figures 2B–2E) and
reduced reversine-induced apoptosis (Figure 2F). In the absence
of reversine, BCL9L silencing did not induce any significant
changes in cell proliferation or apoptosis, nor did it affect the
rate of constitutive segregation errors (Figure S4A). BCL9L
knockdown also induced reversine tolerance in a panel of
near-diploid colorectal cell lines that express BCL9L (Gaasenbeek et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2011; Figures S4B–S4D). In contrast,
survival of BCL9L mutant and/or non-expressing cells (LS-174T
and RKO) in reversine was not improved after BCL9L silencing,
suggesting on-target specificity of the BCL9L siRNAs (Figures
S4B–S4D; see also COSMIC database at cancer.sanger.ac.uk).
Next, we examined the fate of daughter cells arising from error-free mitoses or mitoses with naturally occurring segregation
errors. For this we used HCT-116 cells expressing H2B-RFP to
visualize chromosomes. Following control siRNA transfection,
the majority of daughter cells that had undergone a chromosome
segregation error did not divide again within 48 hr (Figures 2G
and S5A, and Movies S1, S2, S3, and S4 for examples of endogenous segregation errors). Longer-term observation of cells that
had undergone a chromosome segregation error revealed that
24.5% of arrested cells died between 48 and 72 hr after mitosis
(Figure S5B). In contrast, the majority of daughter cells entered a
second mitosis following silencing of BCL9L or TP53, whether an
endogenous segregation error occurred or not (Figures 2G and
S5A). Similar results were found through live-cell microscopy
of three additional cell lines (Figure S5C). These results suggest
that BCL9L dysfunction promotes survival following chromosome segregation errors by a mechanism that may not be unique
to Mps1 inhibition but a more general mechanism that also applies to endogenous chromosome segregation errors.
We generated HCT-116 cells with partial depletion of BCL9L
(Figure S5D) using a lentiviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA) vector
to study the long-term consequences of BCL9L silencing.
Treatment with 125 nM reversine for 15 days revealed an increase in colony-forming efficiency in the shBCL9L cells relative
to shControl (shCtrl) cells (Figure 2H). To study whether BCL9L
depletion promotes the propagation of aneuploid cells, we
treated cells with 125 nM reversine for 15 days followed by a
2-week recovery in drug-free medium, and performed centromeric FISH analysis with centromeric probes for four chromosomes (Figure 2I). In untreated cells, BCL9L silencing produced
a small but significant increase in the modal centromeric deviation when compared with shCtrl for chromosomes 2 and 8. In

number of resistant colonies in HCT-116 TP53-null and CL-40
cells, a CRC cell line harboring the most frequent TP53 mutation in CRC (R248Q, Figure 3E). These data support the hypothesis that BCL9L depletion results in an additive survival
effect in TP53-mutant cells and suggest that loss of BCL9L contributes to aneuploidy tolerance in both TP53-competent and
mutant CRC.
Effect of BCL9L Loss on Xenograft Models of
Tumorigenesis
To determine the role of BCL9L as an aneuploidy suppressor
in vivo, we injected BCL9L-depleted or control cells into immunocompromised mice following the protocol shown in Figure 4A.
We observed that reversine pre-treatment of shBCL9L cells
dramatically improved the engraftment efficiency and growth
rate when compared with the rest of the experimental situations
(Figures 4B and 4C). Although untreated shBCL9L cells did
not engraft better, they displayed a modest growth advantage
when compared with untreated shCtrl cells, although these differences were not statistically significant (Figure 4C).
86 Cancer Cell 31, 79–93, January 9, 2017

We hypothesized that the increased karyotypic diversity in
BCL9L-deficient cells pre-treated with reversine (Figures 2J
and 3C) might lead to clonal selection of advantageous karyotypes, promoting intratumor heterogeneity of whole chromosome aneuploidies in the mouse xenografts. SNP profiling of
the xenografts (Figure 4D) detected ubiquitous alterations on
chromosomes 8, 10, 16, and 17 that are known for parental
HCT-116 cells, together with intratumor heterogeneity for whole
chromosome 12 in one region of two BCL9L-depleted xenografts and whole chromosome 7 gain in one region of one
BCL9L-depleted xenografts. Notably, whole chromosome gains
were observed in shBCL9L cells both with and without reversine,
substantiating the role of BCL9L loss in the tolerance and propagation of endogenous segregation errors. Control cells did not
show any heterogeneous whole chromosome alterations. Gain
of the long arm of chromosome 21 was seen in one region of
one shCtrl xenograft. These data support the ability of BCL9L
depletion to foster intratumor heterogeneity and the propagation
of subclones with whole chromosome aneuploidies distinct from
other subclones within the same tumor.

Mechanism of BCL9L-Mediated Aneuploidy
Surveillance
p53 stabilization mediates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest
upon genotoxic stress. Western blot analysis showed that
BCL9L silencing strongly inhibited p53 accumulation following
reversine treatment in TP53-WT HCT-116, SW48, and C99

cells, an effect reproduced with three siRNA duplexes (Figures
5A and S6A). We did not detect p53 accumulation in TP53mutant SNU-C5 cells upon reversine treatment (Figure 5A).
BCL9L silencing in HCT-116 did not affect TP53 mRNA
levels (Figure S6B). However, BCL9L silencing in HCT-116
inhibited the induction of the p53 transcriptional targets

CDKN1A (p21) and BBC3 (Puma) after reversine treatment
(Figure S6C).
We then examined MDM2 expression due to its important
role in regulating p53 stability (Karni-Schmidt et al., 2016).
Following reversine treatment, we observed an intense band
around 60 kDa similar to the MDM2-p60 N-terminal cleavage
product previously described (Oliver et al., 2011) (Figure 5B)
that was not detected by C-terminal MDM2 antibodies (Figure S6D). MDM2-p60 accumulated mainly in the nucleus where
it co-localized with p53 (Figure S6E). Importantly, MDM2 cleavage was still detectable in TP53-null cells following reversine
exposure, and was impaired following BCL9L silencing and reversine treatment in both TP53-WT (Figure 5B, compare lanes
2 and 4) and TP53-null cells (Figure 5B, compare lanes 6 and 8).
Active caspase-2 cleaves MDM2, generating the MDM2-p60
fragment as part of a p53 regulatory cascade. MDM2-p60 conserves the p53 binding domain but is devoid of the RING
domain. p60-p53 heterodimers cannot be targeted for degradation, which ultimately enhances p53 accumulation (Oliver et al.,
2011; Terry et al., 2015). We observed that reversine treatment
induced cleavage of caspase-2 (determined by cleavage of caspase-2 into p32 and p19 moieties) in both HCT-116 TP53-WT
and to a lesser extent in TP53-null cells (Figure 5C). We also
observed reduced levels of caspase-2 protein and mRNA in
BCL9L-depleted HCT-116 TP53-WT and null cells (Figures 5C,
5D, and S5D), which contributed to lower levels of active caspase-2 upon reversine treatment. A reduction in caspase-2 protein following BCL9L silencing was also confirmed in other cell
lines (Figure S6F) and with different siRNA sequences targeting
BCL9L (Figure S6G). qPCR analysis revealed that reversine
treatment did not increase the expression of PIDD mRNA, a
gene involved in p53-dependent caspase-2 activation (Figure S6H). Cell synchronization and transient reversine exposure
revealed that p53 stabilization, MDM2 cleavage, and caspase-2
activation are detectable after one division in the presence of
reversine (doubling time for HCT-116 = 20 hr), confirming that
one cell division is sufficient to trigger these three events (Figure S6I). Similar to BCL9L silencing, caspase-2 depletion by
RNAi attenuated both p53 accumulation and MDM2 cleavage
upon reversine treatment (Figures S7A and B).
These results suggest that reversine induces proteolytic activation of caspase-2 partially independent of p53, and depletion
of BCL9L reduces caspase-2 expression that ultimately prevents
cleavage of MDM2 and stabilization of p53 following reversine
exposure.
Given the higher number of karyotypic alterations in CRC with
co-occurrence of BCL9L and TP53 alterations (Figure 1E) and our
results showing a BCL9L survival effect in TP53-WT and null
backgrounds (Figures 3D, 3E, S4C, and S4D), we investigated
a potential p53-independent role for BCL9L in aneuploidy tolerance. Since caspase-2 cleavage was detectable, but at reduced
levels, in TP53-null cells (Figure 5C), we assessed the role of other
caspase-2 substrates, such as BID, in mediating aneuploidy
tolerance (Guo et al., 2002). Although BCL9L silencing in TP53null cells resulted in lower levels of basal BID mRNA (Figure S7C),
only a moderate reduction in BID protein steady-state levels was
observed (Figures 5E and S7D). In TP53-null cells, reversine
treatment induced formation of a 15 kDa band consistent with
tBID (Figures 5E and S7D), derived through caspase-mediated
88 Cancer Cell 31, 79–93, January 9, 2017

cleavage of BID. Silencing of either BCL9L or caspase-2 attenuated this cleavage (Figures 5E and S7D). tBID relocalizes to the
outer mitochondrial membrane where it activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Korsmeyer et al., 2000). Consistent
with a p53-independent pro-apoptotic role for BCL9L, BCL9L
and caspase-2 depletion prevented poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) cleavage in reversine-treated TP53-null HCT-116
cells (Figure 5F). Colony-forming assays confirmed that BID
depletion by siRNA had a similar effect to BCL9L silencing in reversine-treated HCT-116 TP53-null cells (Figure 5G). We did not
find significant changes in the expression of other caspases and
mitochondrial apoptotic regulators (Figure S7E).
Consistent with the results shown above, caspase-2 depletion
increased resistance to reversine treatment in BrdU incorporation
assays (Figure S7F), and also increased tolerance to endogenous
segregation errors in HCT-116 cells (Figure 5H). Finally, co-transfection of siRNA targeting BCL9L and a caspase-2 expression
plasmid (Figure S7G) reverted the tolerance of reversine treatment mediated by BCL9L depletion (Figure 5I). These observations support a mechanism of aneuploidy tolerance whereby
caspase-2 suppression in BCL9L-depleted cells enhances the
survival of cancer cells after endogenous or drug-mediated segregation errors in both TP53-WT and TP53-null backgrounds.
Next, we explored the hypothesis that BCL9L loss drives
aneuploidy tolerance through repression of Wnt signaling. BCL9/
BCL9L and their binding partners b-catenin and Pygo function
as transcriptional co-activators that facilitate the activity of the
TCF/LEF family of transcription factors (de la Roche et al., 2008).
We confirmed that BCL9L silencing inhibited TCF4 transcriptional
activity in reporter assays and expression of Wnt signaling targets
(Figures S8A and S8B). Examination of the ENCODE database
(Rosenbloom et al., 2012) revealed a potential TCF4-binding site
near the transcription start site of CASP2 that we were able to
confirm by TCF4 chromatin immunoprecipitation in HCT-116 cells
(Figure 6A). Treatment of HCT-116 with PNU74654, a drug that
inhibits Wnt signaling by impairing b-catenin binding to TCF4, triggered a statistically significant downregulation of the Wnt targets
AXIN2 and MYC along with reduction of caspase-2 mRNA and
protein (Figures 6B and 6C). In addition, treatment of HCT-116
cells with PNU74654 induced reversine tolerance relative to
HCT-116 cells treated with reversine alone (Figures 6D and 6E).
In summary, we propose a model in which partial loss of
BCL9L results in lower caspase-2 mRNA and protein levels in
both TP53-WT and mutant cells, likely mediated through inhibition of TCF4 transcriptional activity at the CASP2 promoter. After
chromosome segregation errors, fully functional BCL9L permits
transcription and activation of caspase-2, resulting in p53 stabilization via MDM2 cleavage in TP53-WT cells and BID cleavage
in TP53-mutant cells, ultimately inducing arrest and apoptosis
(Figure 6F). In cancer cells, BCL9L dysfunction results in lower
levels of caspase-2, and when chromosome missegregation
occurs this deficiency results in suboptimal activation of caspase-2, leading to impaired p53 stabilization, tBID formation,
and attenuated cell death.

with cancer multidrug resistance (Kuznetsova et al., 2015; Lee
et al., 2011; Swanton et al., 2006). These high-risk features of
CIN suggest that targeting aneuploid cancer cell populations
may have therapeutic potential, emphasizing the importance of
understanding the cellular processes that initiate and promote
tolerance of aneuploidy.
Tumors harbor a wide spectrum of structural and numerical
chromosomal alterations (Andor et al., 2015) ranging from diploid

or near-diploid tumors to highly aneuploid samples with more
complex karyotypes. Notwithstanding that p53 is closely associated with CIN and aneuploidy in CRC, little is known about
somatic events that might cooperate with p53 dysfunction in
generating or sustaining the accumulation of chromosomal alterations. Our data provide support for BCL9L as an aneuploidy
tumor-suppressor gene in CRC, the loss of which sustains
aneuploidy tolerance, both independently of and in cooperation
with p53, through repression of caspase-2. These results are

supported by studies in caspase-2 knockout mouse models in
which transformed cells develop aneuploidy and become more
aggressive (Dorstyn et al., 2012; Puccini et al., 2013).
The mechanisms leading to p53 accumulation in response to
chromosomal missegregation events are unclear. DNA damage
(Janssen et al., 2011), histone phosphorylation (Hinchcliffe et al.,
2016) and reactive oxygen species (Li et al., 2010) have all been
proposed as mechanisms of p53 accumulation in CIN cells.
Our data reveal that caspase-2 depletion induces tolerance
of endogenous chromosome segregation errors and prevents
p53 accumulation in response to artificial induction of chromosome segregation errors using an Mps1 inhibitor, reversine, supporting a central role for caspase-2 as an enzyme regulating p53,
underpinned by seminal work from other groups (Dorstyn et al.,
2012; Oliver et al., 2011; Terry et al., 2015). We found that loss of
BCL9L prevents cleavage of BID through caspase-2 in TP53-null
cells and thereby inhibits apoptosis. This p53-independent role
for caspase-2 in the suppression of aneuploidy might operate
as a fail-safe mechanism to limit CIN in TP53-mutant tumors,
thereby compromising outgrowth of heterogeneous tumor cells
and impairing subsequent tumor adaptation. Conceivably, in
TP53-WT cells parallel mechanisms of aneuploidy surveillance
independent of p53 might reinforce the removal of aneuploid
cells in instances where chromosome missegregation events
may remain undetected by p53.
Our results support the possibility that caspase-2 can be activated upstream of p53 after chromosome missegregation. This
emphasizes the need to elucidate the mechanisms of caspase-2
activation, such as its dependence on phosphorylation (Andersen et al., 2009) or proteotoxic stress, frequently observed in
aneuploid cells (Upton et al., 2008). This process might constitute a mechanism of genome instability sensing that can operate
independently of p53.
Although evidence supports roles for both BCL9L and BCL9 in
the regulation of gene expression that are independent of b-catenin (Cantu et al., 2014), our data suggest that caspase-2 is a
target of the b-catenin/TCF4 transcriptional complex. However,
it is unclear whether BCL9L regulates a specific subset of genes
distinct from its homolog BCL9. Our data support the ‘‘just-right’’
model (Albuquerque et al., 2002) for the modulation of Wnt
signaling in tumors to render TCF transcriptional activation sufficient for cancer cell viability, while minimizing transcriptional
activation of genes associated with cell death. More specifically,
partial inhibition of TCF4 transcriptional activity in tumors with
excessive Wnt pathway activation through BCL9L dysfunction
might reduce caspase-2 expression to levels compatible with
cell viability, enhancing tolerance of segregation errors and intratumor heterogeneity.
Consistent with these observations, and notwithstanding
the limitations of the xenograft evolutionary experiments due
to animal welfare considerations and the resulting short time
course of such studies, the xenograft data support the ability
of BCL9L silencing to propagate intratumor heterogeneity manifested as whole chromosome aneuploidies that are spatially
distinct within individual tumors.
Based on the genomic analysis presented here, the characterization of BCL9L as an aneuploidy suppressor conforms to a
haploinsufficiency model based on results from our analyses of
CRC datasets and our functional work. This model has been
90 Cancer Cell 31, 79–93, January 9, 2017

frequently described for other tumor suppressors such as
PTEN, BRCA1, and RAD17 (Berger et al., 2011). Such observations may begin to explain why the identification of aneuploidy
suppressors has proved evasive, and suggest the need for
deeper analysis of genomic datasets focusing on haploinsufficiency as a possible mechanism of tolerance to large-scale
karyotypic alterations.
In summary, these data support a role for BCL9L as an aneuploidy tolerance gene, conforming to criteria for a significantly
mutated driver gene and tumor suppressor in CRC (Giannakis
et al., 2016; Tamborero et al., 2013; Vogelstein et al., 2013). Understanding aneuploidy tolerance mechanisms more widely, and
the BCL9L/caspase-2/BID axis specifically, may unravel potential vulnerabilities in aneuploid cancers, which could be exploited
to limit intercellular heterogeneity, a substrate for selection and
tumor evolution.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Patient Samples
Tissue collection was approved by an ethics committee (NRS Committee
South Central-Oxford B, REC reference 05/Q1605/66), and all individuals
included in this study had provided written informed consent for the analysis
presented.
Reversine Survival Screen
Five thousand HCT-116 cells per well were seeded on 96-well plates with
siRNA transfection medium and DMSO or 250 nM reversine. Cells were grown
for 3 days and cell viability was measured by Cell Titer Blue (Promega). The
surviving fraction for each siRNA pool was calculated as the ratio of the fluorescent Cell Titer Blue signal of treated wells between untreated wells (four
replicates). Data shown in Figure 1A were normalized to siCtrl2 (siGENOME).
Reversine Survival Assays
For siRNA short-term survival, cells were plated in transfection medium and
250 nM reversine for 3 days. Cell number was measured by DAPI staining
and automated imaging (Acumen), cell viability was measured with Cell Titer
Blue (Promega) or alternatively, cells were harvested and analyzed after 1 hr
of BrdU incorporation. For colony-forming assays with siRNA, cells were transfected for 3 days and replated in serial dilutions in the presence or absence
of reversine. After 5 days of treatment, reversine-containing medium was replaced by drug-free medium and cell colonies grown until the appropriate
size was reached.
For long-term colony-forming assays (shRNA), cells were treated for 15 days
with 125 nM reversine.
FISH Analysis
For development of aneuploidy, stable BCL9L knockdown and control cells
were treated for 15 days with 125 nM reversine. Reversine-containing medium
was replaced by drug-free medium and cells were allowed to recover for
2 weeks. Next, cells were grown on glass slides and centromeric FISH was
performed (CEP 1, 2, 8, and 15; Abbot Molecular). Centromeric signals were
counted and modal centromeric variation was calculated as the fraction of
cells with centromeric signals different from the modal number within the
population.
