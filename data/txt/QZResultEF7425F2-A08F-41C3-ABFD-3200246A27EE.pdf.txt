Abstract
Ionizing radiation (IR) therapy is one of the most commonly
used treatments for cancer patients. The responses of tumor
cells to IR are often tissue specific and depend on pathway
aberrations present in the tumor. Identifying molecules and
mechanisms that sensitize tumor cells to IR provides new
potential therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. In this
study, we used two genetically engineered mouse carcinoma
models, brain choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) and prostate,
to test the effect of inactivating gadd45a, a DNA damage
response p53 target gene, on tumor responses to IR. We show
that gadd45a deficiency significantly increases tumor cell
death after radiation. Effect on survival was assessed in the
CPC model and was extended in IR-treated mice with gadd45a
deficiency compared with those expressing wild-type gadd45a.
These studies show a significant effect of gadd45a inactivation
in sensitizing tumor cells to IR, implicating gadd45a as a
potential drug target in radiotherapy management. [Cancer

Introduction
Ionizing Radiation (IR) is one of the most commonly used
therapies in oncology. Tumor cell responses to IR are tissue specific
and depend greatly on the pathway defects present within tumors.
Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of the cellular
responses to IR is essential for managing and improving this mode
of cancer treatment.
The tumor suppressor gene Trp(p53) is a key player in the cell
response to stress signals, including IR. For example, following IR
treatment, murine thymocytes undergo rapid p53-dependent
apoptosis, fibroblasts enter irreversible p53-dependent cell cycle
arrest, whereas epithelial cells usually go through reversible cell cycle
arrest (1). Stress signals, including DNA damage and oncogenic
events, induce p53 activity eliciting differential expression of p53
target genes. These downstream genes can be divided into major
groups categorized by established p53 roles in a given biological
response. The best characterized of these include cell cycle arrest
genes [e.g., p21(Cdkn1), gadd45a, and 14-3-3r] and apoptosis genes
[e.g., bax, Apaf1, puma, p53AIP1, and noxa; refs. 2, 3]. Among
p53-regulated cell cycle control genes, gadd45a has been shown to
play an important role in DNA damage–induced cell responses.

For example, gadd45a deficiency causes defective UV-induced
nucleotide excision repair (4). Gadd45a participates in the proper
control of the G2-M checkpoint in response to UV radiation and of
the S-phase checkpoint under multiple conditions of nutrient
deprivation (5–7). Gadd45a-null mouse embryonic fibroblast cells
exhibit increased aneuploidy accompanied with abnormal centromere amplification; when exposed to IR, gadd45a knockout mice also
show increased lymphomagenesis compared with control mice (8).
Interestingly, in vivo studies have shown that gadd45a inactivation
also causes abnormal p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, T-cell hyperproliferation, and a lupus-like autoimmune
disease in mice (9, 10). In addition to p53, BRCA1 and FOXO3a
have also been shown to activate gadd45a gene expression (11, 12).
In addition to cell cycle control, there is evidence that gadd45a is
also involved in DNA damage–induced apoptosis. For example,
gadd45a prevents UV-induced skin tumors and promotes keratinocyte apoptosis in mice via the p38 and p53 pathways (13).
Similarly, gadd45a suppresses Ras-induced mammary tumorigenesis by p38-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (14).
Overexpression of gadd45a in HeLa cells induces apoptosis through
translocation of Bim to mitochondria (15). However, little is known
about the role of gadd45a in control of apoptosis in the cellular
response to IR in vivo.
In the current study, we used in genetically engineered mouse
models of spontaneous brain and prostate carcinoma to investigate
the role of gadd45a role in epithelial tumor responses to IR
treatment. We found that gadd45a inactivation increased the
in vivo sensitivity of carcinoma cells to IR resulting in significantly
delayed tumor progression.

Materials and Methods
Mice. The transgenic TgT121 brain tumor mouse model (16, 17),
the TgAPT121 prostate carcinoma mouse model (18), and mice harboring
a homozygous deletion of the gadd45a gene (8) or of the p21 gene (19)
were previously described. TgT121;gadd45a / and TgT121;gadd45a+/ were
generated by crossing hemizygous TgT121 mice with gadd45a / mice, and
TgT121;p21 / and TgT121;p21+/ were generated by crossing hemizygous
TgT121 mice with p21 / mice. TgAPT121;gadd45a / mice were generated
by crossing TgT121 mice with gadd45a / mice. To produce homozygous
null backgrounds, transgenic mice that were heterozygous at the desired
locus were crossed to respective homozygous null animals. In every case,
the oncogenic transgene was maintained in the hemizygous state.
Radiation treatment. To assess brain tumor cell responses, 2-mo-old
mice (male and female) were treated with one 10-Gy dose whole-body
radiation and then euthanized 4.5 h after treatment for terminal
deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) assay. A different group of mice were treated with the same dose
of irradiation and were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; 30 Ag/g
body weight) 4.5 h after treatment; the mice were euthanized 1 h after the
injection and brain tissues were fixed for immunohistochemical assay. For
analysis of prostate tumor cells, 2-mo-old male mice were treated with one

TUNEL and proliferation assays. Brain and prostate tissues were fixed,
embedded, and sectioned as described (20). Apoptotic cells were detected
in sections by the TUNEL assay (17, 20). For each mouse, 8 to 10 different
fields were counted under microscope. At least three mice of each genotype
were analyzed, and the counts of apoptotic indexes were averaged and the
SDs within each genotype group were calculated (represented by error
bars). Proliferation rate of tumor cells was measured by BrdUrd
immunostaining as previously described (20).
Statistics. T tests were used to evaluate the difference in apoptosis level
between different groups of mice. Log-rank tests were used for survival
analysis.

Results

Figure 1. Gadd45a and p21 are not effectors of the p53-dependent apoptotic
response to oncogenic stress. Brain sections from three or more mice of
each genotype were analyzed by TUNEL. Average apoptotic indexes and SDs
were calculated as described in Materials and Methods. Inactivation of either
gadd45a or p21 does not significantly affect p53-dependent apoptosis; deficiency
in both effectors causes a small but statistically significant increase of
apoptosis, potentially due to relaxation of feedback regulation (P < 0.05).

10-Gy whole-body dose. For survival analysis, 2-mo-old TgT121;gadd45a /
and TgT121;gadd45a+/+ mice were irradiated (heads only) at a dose of 2 Gy/d
for a total of 10 Gy with a 1-d interval after receiving treatment for 2 d.
Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% Avertin (0.3 mL/20 g body weight)
before irradiation. Mice were euthanized when signs of illness were present
(e.g., domed head, lethargy).

We previously established a mouse brain epithelial [choroid
plexus epithelium (CPE)] tumor model, TgT121, in which choroid
plexus carcinoma (CPC) development is initiated by cell-specific
transgenic expression of T121, an NH2-terminal fragment of
SV40 T antigen that inactivates pRb and related proteins, p107
and p130 (21). T121 acutely induces aberrant CPE cell proliferation
accompanied by p53-mediated apoptosis and predisposes to
aggressive tumor growth, which occurs on p53 inactivation.
Tumors are histologically indistinguishable from human CPCs
(17). To evaluate the contribution of p53 downstream genes to
p53 tumor suppression function in TgT121 mice, we generated
TgT121;gadd45a / mice, and found that, unlike p53 deficiency,
gadd45a deficiency does not affect the apoptosis level induced by
pRb function loss (Fig. 1). To determine whether the response to
irradiation was affected by gadd45adeficiency, we treated
TgT121;gadd45a / , TgT121;gadd45a+/ , and TgT121;gadd45a+/+ mice
with a single dose of IR to the head (10 Gy) and examined acute

Gadd45a and p21 increased the effect
but not additively. Increased IR-induced
apoptosis was p53 dependent as
evidenced by its reduction in p53-null
backgrounds.

effects within the tumor 4.5 hours after the treatment. Apoptosis,
measured by the TUNEL assay, was significantly increased in
TgT121;gadd45a / tumors (16.5 F 3.6%; n = 5) compared with
the TgT121;gadd45a+/+ controls (8.2 F 0.8%; n = 5; P < 0.05).
TgT121;gadd45a+/ tumors yielded an intermediate apoptosis
index (12.4 F 2.7%; n = 4; Fig. 2). The CPE of nontransgenic mice,
both gadd45a+/+ and gadd45a / , contained a very low level of
IR-induced apoptosis(<1%; data not shown).
Another p53 downstream cell cycle control gene, p21, also
plays an important role in the cellular response to DNA damage
signals, eliciting G1 or G2-M cell cycle arrest (19, 22, 23). Thus, we
also examined the IR-induced apoptosis in CPE tumors of
TgT121;p21 / mice. Similar to that of TgT121;gadd45a / mice,
without IR treatment the average CPE tumor cell apoptosis index
of TgT121;p21 / mice was about the same as that of TgT121;p21+/+
mice. However, with IR treatment the average apoptosis index in
tumors of TgT121;p21 / mice (17.1 F 2.3%; n = 3) was f2-fold
greater than that of TgT121;p21+/+ mice (8.5 F 0.8%; n = 5; P < 0.05),
with an intermediate level of apoptosis in the tumors of
TgT121;p21+/ mice (11.5 F 1.7%; n = 4; Fig. 2). Inactivating
both gadd45a and p21 genes caused an even higher level of IRinduced apoptosis (21.1 F 1.1%; n = 5) compared with inactivating
either gadd45a or p21 alone (Fig. 2). Although the apoptosis level
was significantly increased, there was no significant change in
the tumor cell proliferation rates in TgT121;gadd45a / and
TgT121;p21 / mice compared with TgT121 control mice as
determined by BrdUrd incorporation (data not shown).
These data indicate that inactivation of p53 downstream cell
cycle arrest genes gadd45a or p21 sensitizes epithelial tumor cells
to DNA damage in vivo. To determine whether these effects were
mediated by p53, we measured the IR-induced apoptosis levels of
TgT121;p53 / and TgT121;p21 / ;p53 / mice, which were 3.3% +

www.aacrjournals.org

1.2% (n = 4) and 3.3% + 0.2% (n = 4), respectively, implying that the
increased IR-induced cell death in TgT121;p21 / mice, like the
oncogene-induced death, was dependent on p53 function (Fig. 2).
To determine whether IR-induced tumor cell death enhancement by gadd45 or p21 deficiency was specific to CPE tumors,
or might be more broadly applicable, we examined IRinduced apoptosis in a prostate cancer mouse model, TgAPT121 .
In this model, tumors were initiated by prostate epithelial
expression of T121 using the probasin promoter. Aberrant
proliferation and abundant apoptosis occurs in prostate luminal
epithelial cells, causing the development of mouse prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia and establishing the selective pressure
for tumor progression. However, unlike the CPE model and a
T121 -induced mammary gland tumor model (17, 24), the apoptosis
is not mediated by p53 but rather by phosphatase and
tensin homologue (18). TgAPT121 male mice display slow progression to well-differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma (18).
We generated TgAPT121;gadd45a+/+, TgAPT121;gadd45a+/ , and
TgAPT121;gadd45a / mice. Male mice at 2 to 3 months of age
were treated with one dose of IR (10 Gy; whole body) and prostate
apoptosis was measured by TUNEL. Nontransgenic prostate
apoptosis was very low (<1%; Fig. 3A). TgAPT121;gadd45a+/+
prostate apoptosis increased to 10.0 F 1.7% (n = 6; P < 0.05;
Fig. 3B), whereas TgAPT121;gadd45a+/ prostates showed intermediate levels of apoptosis (14.9 F 2.6%). Once again, gadd45a
deficiency caused a high level of apoptosis in response to IR
(22.1 F 2.4%; n = 6). Therefore, as in the brain epithelial tumor
model, inactivating gadd45a sensitizes prostate cancer cells to IR
in vivo. It is worth to note that in the absence of IR, gadd45
deficiency also caused increased apoptosis level without IR.
Because apoptosis levels are a critical factor in over all tumor
growth rates and animal survival, we further examined the effect of

was reached or that there is overlap in IR-mediated DNA damage
checkpoints. Interpretation of survival studies in mice with the
compound deficiency (Supplementary Fig. S1) was confounded by
the observation that all TgT121 mice with a p21 deficiency
developed severe hydrocephalus independent of IR treatment.

Discussion

Figure 4. Gadd45a inactivation extended survival from brain tumors in
IR-treated TgT121 mice. A, survival of TgT121;gadd45a+/+ mice and
TgT121;gadd45a / mice without IR treatment. Kaplan-Meier curves showed a
shorter survival of TgT121;gadd45a / mice (t 50 = 207 d; n = 45) compared
with TgT121;gadd45a+/+ mice (t 50 = 263 d; n = 60). P < 0.05, log-rank test.
B, after sublethal IR treatment to the head (see Materials and Methods),
TgT121;gadd45a / mice had a better survival (t 50 = 285 d; n = 7) than
TgT121;gadd45a+/+ mice (t 50 = 223 d; n = 18; P < 0.05, log-rank test).

gadd45a inactivation on the survival of IR-treated mice. Brain
carcinomas of TgT121 mice develop life-threatening tumors with
consistent timing, whereas prostate adenocarcinomas of TgAPT121
mice do not reproducibly affect survival (18, 25). Therefore, the
brain tumor model was used for survival studies. In the absence of
IR, TgT121;gadd45a / mice had a shorter survival time (t 50 = 207
days; n = 45) than did TgT121;gadd45a+/+ mice (t 50 = 263 days;
n = 60; Fig. 4A; P < 0.05), indicating a tumor suppression function
of gadd45a gene. In the IR treatment study, 2-monthold TgT121;gadd45a+/+ and TgT121;gadd45a / mice were irradiated
by a 137Cs irradiator using a modified clinical protocol. Consistent
with an increased apoptosis index, TgT121;gadd45a / mice (t 50 =
285 days; n = 7) lived significantly longer than TgT121;gadd45a+/+
mice (t 50 = 228 days; n = 18; P < 0.05; Fig. 4B). In addition, the
survival time of IR-treated TgT121;gadd45a+/+ mice was shortened
by f30% after IR treatment compared with untreated mice. Also
noteworthy, inactivating both gadd45a and p21 genes increased IRinduced apoptosis more than did inactivation of either gene alone
(Fig. 2B). However, the effect of inactivating gadd45a or p21 was
not additive, suggesting either that a maximum detectable level

These studies show that gadd45a inactivation sensitizes both
brain and prostate epithelial cancer cells to IR treatment. Tumor
progression is slowed and survival extended in the brain carcinoma
mouse model. Interestingly, a previous clinical report showed that
gadd45a expression levels correlated with radiotherapy prognosis
in a group of cervical cancer patients (26). Patients with relatively
low gadd45a expression induction showed better prognosis
following radiotherapy than patients with high gadd45a expression
levels (26). Our data provide a possible explanation for this
observation. Together, these data suggest that gadd45a may serve
as a radiotherapy prognosis indicator and that inactivating
gadd45a, possibly through small molecule inhibitors, could be
used in conjunction with radiation to improve response to
treatment.
Enhanced apoptotic response to IR in the absence of Gadd45a or
p21 seems to depend on p53 function. Whereas CPC tumor cell
apoptosis was increased after IR treatment in TgT121;p21 / mice
compared with TgT121;p21+/+ mice, the effect was negated on
further deficiency in p53 (Fig. 2B). Hence, this combined
therapeutic approach is predicted to be effective only for tumors
that retain p53 function. Interestingly, in the clinical study
mentioned above, tumors of all patients included in the study
were genotypically wild-type for p53 (26). In the brain tumor
system, inactivation of p21 was associated with adverse ‘‘side
effects’’; hydrocephalus was induced with high frequency by an
undefined mechanism. However, inactivation of Gadd45a did not
cause adverse effects and, thus, based on the preclinical studies
described here, would constitute a valid target for enhancement of
radiation therapy. These observations underscore the need for
target validation in specific tumor types using appropriate
preclinical models. Finally, in the prostate cancer model, Gadd45a
inactivation caused increased apoptosis in the absence of IR
(Fig. 3B), although the oncogene-induced cell death in this tissue is
p53 independent (18). This unanticipated result suggests that
inhibition of Gadd45a alone in some tumor types may have
significant antitumor activity. In future experiments, it will be
important to test whether gadd45a inactivation–mediated sensitization is also effective in other cancer types, especially in those
cancers for which surgery or chemotherapy has only modest
effects.
