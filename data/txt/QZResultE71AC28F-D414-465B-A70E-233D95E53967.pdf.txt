ABSTRACT
Recent clinical data in lung cancer suggests that epigenetically targeted therapy
may selectively enhance chemotherapeutic sensitivity. There have been few if any
studies rigorously evaluating this hypothesized priming effect. Here we describe
a series of investigations testing whether epigenetic priming with azacitidine and
entinostat increases sensitivity of NSCLC to cytotoxic agents.
We noted no differences in chemosensitivity following treatment with epigenetic
therapy in in vitro assays of viability and colony growth. Using cell line and patientderived xenograft (PDX) models, we also observed no change in responsiveness
to cisplatin in vivo. In select models, we noted differential responses to irinotecan
treatment in vivo. In vitro epigenetic therapy prior to tumor implantation abrogated
response of H460 xenografts to irinotecan. Conversely, in vitro epigenetic therapy
appeared to sensitize A549 xenografts (tumor growth inhibition 51%, vs. 22% in
mock-pretreated control). In vivo epigenetic therapy enhanced the response of
adenocarcinoma PDX to irinotecan.
Taken together, these data do not support broadly applicable epigenetic priming
in NSCLC. Priming effects may be context-specific, dependent on both tumor and host
factors. Further preclinical study is necessary to determine whether, and in which
contexts, priming with epigenetic therapy has potential to enhance chemotherapeutic
efficacy in NSCLC patients.

high toxicity, resistance, and recurrence of disease, which
highlights the need for more effective treatments.
There is substantial evidence (reviewed elsewhere)
that epigenetic dysregulation, including silencing of
tumors suppressor genes, is intimately involved in
lung carcinogenesis [8–10]. We recently explored the
potential efficacy of a combinatorial epigenetic therapy
strategy for the treatment of recurrent metastatic NSCLC,
using the demethylating agent, azacitidine (Aza),
and the class I specific histone deacetylase inhibitor
(HDI), entinostat [11]. A small number of patients
(2/34) exhibited objective responses to combination
epigenetic therapy alone, and 10 others experienced

INTRODUCTION
Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) account
for approximately 80% of all cases of lung cancer, a
disease which remains the leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide [1]. The utility of existing targeted
therapies for NSCLC remains limited due to the lack of
targetable oncogenic drivers in many patients, acquired
resistance, and disease recurrence [2–7]. As a result,
NSCLC is still frequently treated with conventional
cytotoxic chemotherapy, typically a platinum agent in
combination with a taxane or gemcitabine in first line
therapy. This approach is hampered by limited efficacy,

disease stabilization. A surprising observation from this
trial was that several patients, including patients with rapid
progressive disease while on epigenetic therapy, responded
to their next chemotherapy regimen (Fig. S1), despite a
median of three prior therapies for this patient population.
Two of these patients survived 44 and 52 months after
cessation of epigenetic therapy despite receiving only one
subsequent therapy [11]. A similar scenario was previously
observed in a pilot phase I/II study of the demethylating
agent decitabine in stage IV NSCLC patients, with one
patient receiving chemotherapy aprroximately six months
after decitabine, and surviving 81 months [12]. These
observations, although representing a small sample size,
suggest the potential for epigenetic therapy to sensitize
NSCLC to subsequent chemotherapy. Additional
supporting evidence for a chemotherapy priming effect
comes from recent clinical trials in other solid tumors:
two recent reports provide evidence that treatment with
a demethylating agent (azacitidine or decitabine) can
re-sensitize resistant and refractory ovarian tumors to
platinum chemotherapy [13, 14].
Preclinical evidence also implicates epigenetic
mechanisms in drug resistance in cancer [15–19]. Several
studies demonstrate sensitization of solid cancers to
chemotherapy following treatment with epigenetically
directed therapies, in association with reactivation of
silenced tumor suppressor genes or restoration of tumor
suppressor protein expression [15, 17, 20]. Interestingly,
one of these studies found that the combination of
decitabine and the pan-HDI, belinostat, was more
effective than decitabine alone at reactivating the silenced
tumor suppressor, hMLH1, and re-sensitizing a cisplatin
resistant ovarian cancer cell line to cisplatin both in vitro
and in vivo [17]. Another recent paper directly implicated
epigenetic alterations, including increased expression
of the histone demethylase, JARID1A/KDM5A, and
loss of H3K4me2/me3 histone marks, in tolerance of a
mutant EGFR NSCLC line to EGFR targeted therapy,
and demonstrated the ability to prevent or suppress the
phenotype through treatment with HDIs [18]. These latter
two studies highlight a distinct role for histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibition, in addition to DNA demethylation, in
reversal of epigenetically mediated resistance mechanisms.
Here we test whether priming with single agent
or combination epigenetic therapy sensitizes NSCLC to
various subsequent chemotherapeutic agents. We include
cisplatin, docetaxel, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine, as
they are FDA approved for the treatment of NSCLC,
as well as irinotecan, which is included in the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines
for the treatment of NSCLC. Although irinotecan is not
commonly used in this setting, the observation from
our recent NSCLC clinical trial that two patients who
received irinotecan following epigenetic therapy achieved
stable disease (Fig. S1) [11] warrants its inclusion. In

addition, the hsp90 inhibitor, 17-AAG, and the proteasome
inhibitor, bortezomib are included to explore sensitization
to drug mechanisms distinct from those of DNA damaging
agents or anti-mitotics. It has been shown that combining
entinostat with 17-AAG synergistically inhibits growth
of several NSCLC cell lines, including A549 [21]. In
addition, work in breast cancer cell lines demonstrated that
HDAC1 maintains the chaperone, hsp90, in a deacetylated
state, allowing its association with and preventing
proteasomal degradation of DNA methyltransferase
1 (DNMT1) [22]. In this model, HDAC1 inhibition
induces hsp90 hyperacetylation, disrupts association
of hsp90 with DNMT1, and promotes ubiquitination
and degradation of DNMT1 via the proteasome. Since
HDAC1 is a target of entinostat, we hypothesized that
pretreatment with entinostat may augment sensitivity to
17-AAG. Bortezomib was also of interest with regard to
this pathway as a direct inhibitor of proteasomal function.
Using several preclinical models encompassing two
of the three most common histological subtypes, we find
that the combination of azacitidine and entinostat enhances
sensitivity of select NSCLC tumors to irinotecan in vivo,
while sensitivity to other agents remains largely unaffected
both in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
Epigenetic therapy does not sensitize NSCLC
cell lines to subsequent chemotherapy in acute
cytotoxicity assays
We sought to determine whether epigenetic therapy
sensitizes NSCLC cell lines to subsequent chemotherapy
in vitro. We selected the following for our epigenetic
priming regimen: 500 nM Aza every 24 hours for 72 hours
(days 0 – 3), 50 nM entinostat for 24 hours (days 2 – 3),
combination, or mock treatment, followed by harvesting
and replating, and culture for one week in drug free
media. This dose and schedule of Aza has been shown to
alter gene methylation and expression patterns and exert
lasting effects on clonogenic and tumorigenic potential
of leukemia, breast, and lung cancer cells [23, 24].
The entinostat dose was selected based on published
pharmacokinetic data obtained from patients who received
the same 7 mg fixed dose as administered in our recent
NSCLC trial [25].
We validated our Aza dosing regimen by
assessing DNA methylation using the Illumina Infinium
450 BeadChip. We found that promoter region DNA
methylation, including only Infinium probes within
1500  bp (+/−) of the transcription start site, decreased
with 72 h Aza or combination treatment in all cell lines
(day 3), and demethylation was maintained one week post
treatment (day 10) (Fig. 1A and Fig. S2A). To validate

NSCLC cell lines

our dosing regimen for entinostat, we first assessed live
cell activity of HDAC2, one of three relevant isoforms
targeted by entinostat [26, 27]. Treatment with 50 nM
entinostat suppressed mean HDAC2 activity by 26.5%,
14.2%, 36.4%, 47.7%, and 38.5% in H1299, H358,
H838, A549, and H460, respectively (Fig. 1B). We also
examined changes in acetylation of histone H4 (lysine
residues 5, 8, 12, and 16) relative to total histone H4 levels
in four cell lines at the end of treatment with entinostat,
Aza, combination, or mock, as described above. We found
that entinostat, Aza, and combination treatment increased
acetyl-H4 by 11.2-, 4.5-, and 14.1-fold, respectively,
in H838, and 1.8-, 2.1, and 5.1-fold, respectively, in
A549 (Fig. 1C-D). However, we did not see an increase
in acetylation in H1299 and H460 with any treatment
(Fig. S2B). These data suggest that the chosen dose
may be insufficient, as indicated by the lower degree of
HDAC2 inhibition or lack of changes in H4 acetylation, in
some cell lines. However, as entinostat has approximately
6-fold greater selectivity for HDAC1 over HDAC2,
we anticipate greater inhibition of that isoform [26]. In
addition, HDACs, including the targets of entinostat
(HDAC1, 2, 3) have many non-histone substrates, and
therefore the pleiotropic effects of entinostat and other
HDAC inhibitors are likely mediated by more than
altered histone acetylation (reviewed elsewhere) [28–31].
Melanoma patients who received a 7 mg fixed oral dose
of entinostat in a phase II clinical trial achieved a mean
plasma Cmax of 49.15 nM [25]. We therefore chose a dose
of 50 nM entinostat for in vitro experiments in order to
mirror clinically relavent drug exposure.
We explored whether cells treated on the above
regimens of epigenetic priming or control in days 0 – 3
exhibited increased sensitivity to chemotherapy by
seeding cells at equal number on day 9, and treating
with chemotherapy for 72 hours beginning on day 10.
Following treatment, cell viability was assessed on
day 13. Nonlinear regression of background corrected,
log-transformed data was performed to obtain IC50
values, 95% confidence intervals, and R2 for each
epigenetic pretreatment condition and chemotherapy
tested (Table S1). In cases where a maximal inhibition
plateau was not reached and the calculated IC50 was
ambiguous (e.g. H358 and H838 treated with cisplatin),
IC50 was considered not determined (ND). Statistical
analysis of logIC50 and standard error of logIC50 via
ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test revealed
no statistically significant differences in IC50 among
pretreatment conditions for any evaluable chemotherapy.
Log dose response curves from data normalized to
untreated controls within each pretreatment group for
a given chemotherapy demonstrate minimal differences
in chemosensitivity across cell lines, pretreatment
conditions, and chemotherapeutic agents tested (Fig. 2
and Fig. S3).

To further test whether epigenetic therapy sensitizes
NSCLC to the effects of chemotherapy in vitro, we selected
sub- or near- IC50 doses of select chemotherapeutic agents
and assessed the effects of these agents on colony growth
with or without pretreatment with epigenetic therapy. Prior
work has suggested that exposure to low concentrations
of demethylating agents (decitabine or Aza) alone can
blunt clonogenic and tumorigenic potential of leukemia
and breast cancer, implying depletion of progenitor or
tumor initiating cell populations [23]. We hypothesized
that pretreatment with epigenetic agents would also
attenuate clonogenic capacity of NSCLC. In addition, if
epigenetic pretreatment sensitizes clonogenic NSCLC cells
to chemotherapeutic agents, we would predict a greater
attenuation of clonogenic capacity following chemotherapy
than that achieved with epigenetic therapy alone.
H358 and A549 cell lines were selected for their
ability to form distinct colonies on a reconstituted
basement membrane matrix (Matrigel). Using the
treatment paradigm previously described, we pretreated
cells with epigenetic therapy. Cells were then seeded at
low density on Matrigel one day prior to 72 hour treatment
with chemotherapy. Colonies were grown an additional
2 – 4 days after treatment, stained, imaged, and quantified
(Fig. 3 and Fig. S4). After normalization to untreated
controls within each epigenetic pretreatment group,
we found that prior epigenetic treatment did not alter
inhibition of H358 colonies by gemcitabine or 17-AAG
(Fig. 3A-B and Fig. S4A-B). In A549 cells, pretreatment
with azacitidine and combination attenuated colony
inhibition by 600 nM cisplatin (−6% vs 13% for mock
pretreatment, p < 0.05), and 1 nM docetaxel (50% vs 62%
for mock pretreatment, p < 0.01), respectively (Fig. 3C-D).
No significant differences were noted among pretreatment
groups in response to 30 nM 17-AAG (Fig. 3C-D),
6 nM bortezomib, and 10 nM 17-AAG (Fig. S4C-D).
These data suggest that pretreatment with an inhibitor
of DNA methylation and/or histone deacetylation, at
the doses tested, does not substantially alter the effects
of chemotherapy on anchorage-dependent clonogenic
capacity of NSCLC in vitro.

In vitro combinatorial epigenetic therapy exerts
differential effects on in vivo chemosensitivity of
NSCLC cell line xenografts
Given the limitations of purely in vitro clonogenic
model systems, we next assessed whether in vitro
pretreatment with the combination of azacitidine and
entinostat, following the treatment paradigm described
above, might alter sensitivity of NSCLC cell line

xenografts to subsequent chemotherapy in vivo. This
model allows for controlled exposure to epigenetic
therapy prior to injection of pretreated cells on day 10
to establish xenografts. Two cell lines, A549 and H460,
were selected for these studies since prior work in our
laboratory demonstrated that their tumor growth rate
in vivo is unaffected (A549) or only moderately impaired
(H460) by epigenetic treatment in vitro (data not shown).
NOD/SCID mice bearing tumors established from
mock and combination epigenetic pretreated A549 cells
were randomized to receive vehicle (saline) twice weekly,
2 mg/kg cisplatin weekly, or 10 mg/kg irinotecan twice
weekly, over the course of three weeks. Despite a lack
of priming to cisplatin in our in vitro studies in A549,
cisplatin was chosen for this experiment as it is a firstline, standard of care agent for treatment of NSCLC.
Irinotecan was included due to the lack of priming to
the other chemotherapeutic agents tested in our in vitro
studies. One animal in the Combo-Irinotecan arm with a
tumor more than 3-fold larger in volume than the second
largest tumor within that treatment arm, and larger than all
tumors in the vehicle control arms for both pretreatments,
was considered an outlier and was therefore excluded from
subsequent analysis (Fig. S5). We observed no difference
in growth between mock and combination pretreated
tumors that received vehicle or cisplatin (Fig. 4A).
However, epigenetic pretreatment appeared to modestly
but consistently augment response to irinotecan compared
to mock pretreatment (Fig. 4A). The end of study mean
tumor growth inhibition (TGI) following irinotecan
treatment was 22% for mock pretreated tumors (M-I) and
51% for combination epigenetic pretreated tumors (C-I),
relative to the corresponding vehicle control arms (M-V
and C-V, respectively). Irinotecan treatment decreased
the rate of growth of M-I and C-I tumors by 5.8 mm3/day
( p = 0.05) and 16.8 mm3/day ( p < 0.0001), respectively,
compared to vehicle treatment (M-V and C-V), and the
difference in response to irinotecan was statistically
significant ( p = 0.0001). Based on these data, we conclude
that in vitro pretreatment with combination epigenetic
therapy may sensitize A549 xenografts to irinotecan
treatment in vivo.
Using a similar experimental design, mice bearing
tumors established from mock and combination epigenetic
pretreated H460 cells were randomized to receive vehicle
(saline), 2.5 mg/kg docetaxel, or 10 mg/kg irinotecan,
every fourth day for a total of four injections. Docetaxel
was selected in place of cisplatin due to existing data that
demonstrated synergy between docetaxel and entinostat in
H460 in vitro [21]. The dose of docetaxel was escalated
to 5 mg/kg for the final two injections due to lack of
response at the lower dose. Irinotecan was included given
the results observed in A549 xenografts. Pretreatment with
combination epigenetic therapy alone (C–V) reduced the
rate of H460 tumor growth by 42.5 mm3/day ( p = 0.001)
relative to mock control (M–V) (Fig. 4B), and resulted in a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

TGI of 31%. Interestingly, in mice treated with docetaxel,
epigenetic pretreated tumors (C–D) exhibited an increased
rate of growth (24.7 mm3/day greater increase in tumor
volume, p = 0.0003) compared to vehicle control (C–V),
while mock pretreated tumors (M-D) were unaffected
by docetaxel treatment (p = 0.72) (Fig. 4C). In addition,
while irinotecan inhibited growth of mock pretreated
tumors (M–I) by 40% compared to vehicle control (M–V),
combination epigenetic pretreated tumors (C–I) did not
respond to irinotecan treatment (Fig. 4B).

In vivo combinatorial epigenetic therapy does
not sensitize H358 xenografts to cisplatin or
irinotecan
We next assessed whether in vivo epigenetic therapy
sensitizes NSCLC tumors to immediate subsequent
chemotherapy. H358 xenografts were selected due to the
slower rate of growth in vivo, permitting repeated cycles
of epigenetic therapy prior to chemotherapy. Tumor
bearing nu/nu mice were treated weekly for four weeks
with 0.5 mg/kg Aza (sc, days 1 – 5) and 1 mg/kg entinostat
(ip, day 5), or with vehicle control, prior to randomization
to chemotherapy at the beginning of week five. A similar
dose and schedule of entinostat has been used successfully
in orthotopic models of NSCLC in rats [32]. The dose of
Aza was chosen since it is well tolerated based on prior in
vivo work, and has been shown to be more efficacious in
breast cancer xenografts than higher doses [23]. Following
epigenetic therapy, mice were treated with 2 mg/kg
cisplatin weekly, 10 mg/kg irinotecan twice weekly, or
saline twice weekly for four weeks. Epigenetic therapy
inhibited tumor growth by 36% by day 29 (Fig. 5A).
However, H358 xenografts showed no evidence of a
differential response to subsequent cisplatin or irinotecan
therapy, regardless of pretreatment (Fig. 5B).

Combination epigenetic therapy may prime
response to repeat dose irinotecan in a patientderived NSCLC xenograft model
We extended study of epigenetic priming to
a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of lung
adenocarcinoma, LX7, which has poorly differentiated
histology, is negative for KRAS, EGFR (exons 18–21),
and BRAF mutations, and is negative for ALK-fusions
by cytogenetic analysis. This xenograft was previously
established in immunocompromised mice by direct tumor
cell transplantation from a NSCLC patient, and is serially
passaged in mice. Similarly derived lung cancer PDXs
have previously been shown to exhibit gene expression
patterns more closely related to primary patient tumors
than those of lung cancer cell lines derived from the
PDXs [33].
To assess the effects of epigenetic priming on
response of LX7 to subsequent chemotherapy, tumor

observation. By day 32, no significant difference in mean
tumor volume (+/− SEM) between pretreatment arms
(1345 ± 136 mm3 for vehicle pretreated, 1072 ± 131 mm3
for epigenetic pretreated) was noted (p = 0.19 by two-tailed
unpaired t test). Beginning on day 32, mice were subjected
to a repeat cycle of irinotecan therapy. Two of eight mice
within the vehicle pretreatment arm were euthanized early
due to excessive body weight loss (day 42, final tumor
volume = 1576 mm3) and a large ulcerated tumor (day 45,
final tumor volume = 2789 mm3). Interestingly, epigenetic
pretreated LX7 tumors exhibited increased sensitivity
to irinotecan upon repeat exposure, with regression
of mean tumor volume to slightly below baseline
(day 32) compared to vehicle pretreated tumors, which
exhibited only a brief cytostatic response (Fig. 6C-D).
After adjusting for the difference in tumors sizes between
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

arms at the initiation of repeat treatment on day 32,
we determined that mean tumor volume increased by
9.6 mm3/day less in epigenetic treated mice than in vehicle
treated mice (23.9 vs 33.5 mm3/day, p = 0.013). In both
arms, tumor growth rapidly increased roughly one week
after the final dose of irinotecan, indicating that the degree
of response, but not duration, was altered by epigenetic
priming.

DISCUSSION
Our in vitro assays generally showed no evidence
in support of the epigenetic priming hypothesis, and
collectively, our data suggest that the effects of epigenetic
pretreatment of NSCLC on response to subsequent
chemotherapy may vary with a given epigenetic or

chemotherapeutic agent, and by context. In Matrigel
colony formation assays, pretreatment of A549 with
Aza or Aza plus entinostat appeared to slightly attenuate
the effects of cisplatin or docetaxel, respectively. While
statistically significant, these differences are modest,
and likely do not suggest a clinically relevant shift in
chemotherapy responsiveness. In addition, these effects
were not observed in our cell viability experiments, or with
cisplatin in the more relevant xenograft model. Response
of NSCLC xenografts to cisplatin therapy following
in vitro (A549) and in vivo (H358, LX7) pretreatment
with combination epigenetic therapy was unaltered.
Conversely, in our H460 xenograft model, epigenetic
priming abrogated response of H460 xenografts to
irinotecan, and in fact resulted in a slightly increased rate
of tumor growth in the docetaxel treated group compared
to the vehicle treated group, suggesting the potential
for epigenetic priming to negatively impact response
to subsequent chemotherapy, at least in select contexts.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Mechanistic studies will be important to determine
underlying genetic or epigenetic factors responsible for
these negative interactions in our model, and what, if any,
impact these findings may have on the clinical application
of epigenetic priming.
Some evidence in support of an epigenetic priming
of chemotherapy response was observed in A549 and
LX7 xenografts. Xenografts established from mock
pretreated A549 cells were minimally responsive to
irinotecan, whereas tumors grown from cells pretreated
with combination epigenetic therapy exhibited increased
sensitivity to the same irinotecan therapy. Interestingly,
in addition to the differential responsiveness of H460 and
A549 epigenetic primed tumors to irinotecan, we noted
differential effects of the priming therapy in A549 and
H460 cells. We saw no change in histone H4 acetylation
following combination epigenetic therapy in H460 cells,
whereas H4 acetylation increased approximately 5-fold
in A549 cells treated with the combination of Aza and
65

Oncotarget

entinostat. It is possible that histone hyperacetylation,
which appeared to be lacking in H460 primed cells, is a
key component of the priming effect observed in A549
xenografts.
The A549 xenograft data are notable given that
transient (72 h) in vitro treatment with epigenetic
therapy did not affect the growth of A549 xenografts,
yet altered the response of established xenografts to a
chemotherapeutic agent weeks later. This is of interest
in light of the clinical observations of several patients
whose disease progressed on epigenetic therapy but who
experienced better than expected responses to subsequent
chemotherapy. These data together with the clinical trial
observations suggest that the effects of epigenetic therapy
on tumor cells can be long lasting, and that immediate
response may not be necessary for patients to derive
benefit from this approach.
Some additional evidence in support of an epigenetic
priming of chemotherapy response was observed in LX7
xenografts. LX7 PDXs established from vehicle and
epigenetically pretreated LX7 tumors both responded
strongly to initial, short duration (three injections over
nine days) irinotecan therapy, but recovered following
cessation of treatment. Upon treatment with a second
regimen of irinotecan, epigenetic pretreated LX7 tumors
exhibited increased response to therapy, characterized by
a slowed growth and regression of mean tumor volume to
slightly below baseline (day 32). In comparison, vehicle
pretreated tumors exhibited continued tumor growth, with
a minor cytostatic effect but no regression. The LX7 data
are particularly intriguing for two reasons. First, LX7 is a
patient-derived adenocarcinoma model maintained in mice
and may better reflect the biology of disease than ex vivo cell
line models, as suggested by earlier data from our group [33].
Second, LX7 tumors responded well to initial irinotecan
therapy, but grew quickly after treatment ended, which is
reminiscent of the short-lived response to chemotherapy seen
in many NSCLC patients. Tumors that had no prior exposure
to epigenetic therapy did not respond as well to the second
cycle of irinotecan therapy, as is often the case for recurrent
NSCLC, while tumors previously exposed to epigenetic
therapy again exhibited at least transient tumor regression.
Data from two models of human lung
adenocarcinoma, the cell line A549 and the patientderived primary xenograft LX7, offer support for the idea
that prior exposure to epigenetic therapy may enhance
response of established tumors to irinotecan. Balanced
against this, data from other models, and from these
same models treated with other chemotherapeutic agents,
show no evidence of enhanced response with epigenetic
priming, and in one case suggest a negative interaction.
The effects of prior exposure to epigenetically targeted
agents appear to be highly context dependent.
In the majority of models and with the majority of
cytotoxic chemotherapy agents tested, we were not able
to demonstrate that combinatorial epigenetic therapy with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

azacitidine and entinostat enhanced tumor sensitivity to
subsequent chemotherapy. Taken together, these data call
into question whether in fact azacitidine and entinostat
exposure could augment chemotherapeutic efficacy in a
substantial fraction of lung cancer patients. However, we
cannot exclude the possibility that our model systems do
not fully reflect the genetic and/or epigenetic landscape of
a subset of patients that may derive benefit from epigenetic
priming. In addition, there are many potentially relevant
differences between efficacy in preclinical models and
clinical outcome in patients, notably differences in drug
pharmacokinetics. A randomized phase II clinical trial to
specifically address this question in patients with advanced
lung cancer has been initiated, including priming of
irinotecan. A second trial assessing epigenetic priming of
an irinotecan-based regimen (FOLFIRI) in colon cancer
is also underway. These studies offer the opportunity to
address this clinical hypothesis directly. Comparative data
from the clinical lung cancer study in progress and the
preclinical work presented here, in particular, will be of
interest in defining the extent to which these preclinical
models can reflect treatment paradigms of relevance to
lung cancer patients.

METHODS
Cell lines
NCI-H358 and A549 were purchased in from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were
reauthenticated by STR profiling (Promega StemEltite™)
immediately prior to use for this work. NCI-H1299,
NCI-H838, NCI-H460 were purchased from ATCC
immediately prior to use for this work. Experiments
were conducted on low passage cells. Cells were
routinely checked for mycoplasma (Lonza MycoAlert™
Mycoplasma Detection Kit). Cells were cultured in
RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/
streptomycin, 2 mM l-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate,
10 mM HEPES buffer, and 1.5% sodium bicarbonate, in a
humidified incubator at 37ºC with 5% CO2.

Drugs and reagents
5-azacitidine (Aza) was purchased from Tocris
Bioscience. For in vitro use, Aza was dissolved in
1x PBS as a 4 mM stock and stored at −80ºC in aliquots.
Fresh aliquots were thawed immediately prior to use.
For in vivo studies, Aza was dissolved in saline (0.9%
sodium chloride) at 1 mg/mL and stored at −80ºC in
aliquots. Fresh aliquots were thawed and diluted 1:10
in saline immediately prior to injection. Entinostat
was provided by Syndax Pharmaceuticals. For in vitro
experiments, entinostat was dissolved in DMSO, diluted
to a 200 uM solution, and stored at −20ºC. Drug was
thawed immediately prior to use and diluted 1:4000 in
66

Oncotarget

culture medium to provide a final concentration of 50 nM
entinostat and 0.025% DMSO. For in vivo use, entinostat
was dissolved at 2 mg/ml in DMSO and stored at −20ºC.
Immediately prior to injection, entinostat was thawed
and diluted 1:10 in saline. 17-AAG and bortezomib, and
docetaxel and vinorelbine were purchased from LC Labs
and Selleck Chemicals, respectively, and dissolved in
DMSO for in vitro use. Appropriate dilutions in DMSO
were made to provide a final of 0.025% DMSO in
medium. Cisplatin (APP Pharmaceuticals), Gemcitabine
(Sagent Pharmaceuticals), Docetaxel (Hospira), and
Camptosar (Pfizer) were obtained from the Johns Hopkins
Hospital pharmacy. Gemcitabine was dissolved in saline.
All drugs were diluted with saline for in vivo use. Cisplatin
and gemcitabine were diluted with 1x PBS for in vitro use.

(5 mM) was added to all wash and lysis buffers to retain
existing histone acetylation. The histone fraction was
nuclease treated with benzonase (250 units), and diluted
in an equal volume of 2x Laemmli sample buffer (BioRad). Additional details are provided in the Supplementary
Methods. Western blotting was performed using standard
techniques and the following primary antibodies from
Millipore: Anti-acetyl Histone H4 (Lys5/8/12/16),
clone 3HH4-4C10, 1:1000 dilution, and Anti-Histone H4,
pan, clone 62-10C-2, 1:2000 dilution. Following detection
of acetyl histone H4, blots were stripped for 45 min at
room temperature in Restore stripping buffer (Thermo
Scientific) and re-probed for total histone H4. Protein
levels were quantified using ImageJ software.

Cell viability assays

Treatment of cell lines with epigenetic therapy

DNA from mock, entinostat, Aza, or combination
treated cells was harvested at the end of treatment
(day 3) and one week post treatment (day 10). Global
methylation analysis was performed on bisulfite
converted DNA samples using the Illumina Infinium
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.). Data
were processed using R and Bioconductor. Box plots were
generated using deltaBeta values (deltaBeta = treatment
Beta value – mock Beta value) for probes in which mock
Beta value was >0.5.

Six days after epigenetic treatment (day 9), pretreated
cells were seeded in triplicate in white walled 96-well plates
as follows: H1299 = 1000, H358 = 4200 H838 = 1700,
and A549 = 1500 cells/well. Approximately 24 h later,
cells were treated for 72 h with 17-AAG (3 – 1000 nM,
0.03 – 10 uM for H358), bortezomib (1 – 300 nM),
cisplatin (0.03 – 10 uM), docetaxel (0.3 – 100 nM,
0.3 – 30 nM for A549), gemcitabine (1-300 nM), or
vinorelbine (0.3 – 100 nM). Cell viability was assessed
using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
(Promega) and quantified on a SpectraMax M2e plate
reader (Molecular Devices). Raw data were corrected
for background luminescence, transformed (x=log(x)),
and analyzed by nonlinear regression (log(inhibitor) vs.
response with variable slope) in GraphPad Prism 5 to
obtain IC50 values, 95% confidence intervals, and R2. IC50
was considered not determined if calculated as ambiguous
by Prism. Transformed data were then normalized to
untreated controls within each pretreatment group for
a given chemotherapy to generate log dose response
curves. Experiments were repeated at least twice to ensure
consistent results, with the exception of vinorelbine in H358
and H1299, as no differences were observed in any cell
line. Results from representative experiments are shown.

HDAC activity assay

Matrigel colony formation assays

HDAC2 enzyme activity was assessed in cells
treated for 24 h with 50 nM entinostat or mock using
the HDAC-Glo 2 Assay (Promega), nonlytic format, and
quantified on a Safire2 plate reader (Tecan). Raw data were
corrected for background luminescence and normalized to
mock to determine relative HDAC2 activity.

Six days after epigenetic treatment (day 9),
pretreated H358 and A549 cells were seeded at low
density in 96-well plates (4-5 replicates) on a 40 uL layer
of solidified Matrigel (Corning). Approximately 24 h
later, cells were treated with 10 nM gemcitabine, 10 nM
17-AAG, or 20 nM 17-AAG (H358) or 600 nM cisplatin,
6 nM bortezmib, 10 nM 17-AAG, 30 nM 17-AACG, or
1 nM docetaxel (A549). After 72 h, chemotherapy was
removed, cells were rinsed with 1x PBS, and drug free
media was added. Colonies were grown an additional
2 – 4 days, stained with MTT reagent, and imaged and
counted on the GelCount™ colony counter (Oxord
Optronix). Colony number was normalized to untreated

Cells were seeded at the following densities
(per 75 cm2): 2 × 105 (H1299, H460), 3.5 × 105 (H838,
A549), 1 × 106 (H358). Cells were allowed to adhere 2024 h and were treated with 500 nM Aza or mock (1x PBS)
in fresh media every 24 h for 48 h, followed by treatment
with 500 nM Aza, 50 nM entinostat, combination, or mock
in fresh media (final 0.025% DMSO for all treatments)
for an additional 24 h. After the 72 h treatment, cells
harvested and reseeded at equal density and cultured in
drug-free media.

DNA methylation analysis

Western blot for histone H4 acetylation

control within a given pretreatment group to determine
percent colony formation after chemotherapy.

Tumors were grown to a starting size of approximately
160 mm3 (+/− 25%). Mice were randomized to receive
vehicle or azacitidine (days 1 – 3, 6 – 10, 13 – 17)
and entinostat (days 3, 10, 17). On day 16 and 17,
representative vehicle and epigenetic treated tumors,
respectively, were harvested and pooled. Single cell
suspensions were generated and frozen at −80°C in 90%
FBS/10% DMSO. Cells were later thawed, and 1.3 × 106
cells/mouse were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Once
tumors reached approximately 140 mm3 (+/− 15%), mice
were treated with 2 mg/kg cisplatin (q7d × 2), 10 mg/kg
irinotecan (q4d × 3, repeated on day 32), or vehicle (q4d × 3).

Animal xenografts studies
Protocols for animal experiments were approved
by the John Hopkins University Animal Care and Use
Committee and were strictly followed. Female NOD/SCID
mice were obtained from the Johns Hopkins Research
Animal Resources. Female nude (Foxn1nu/nu) mice were
purchased from Jackson Laboratory. All xenografts were
established from cells injected subcutaneously into the
right hind flank of 6 – 7 week old female mice, in a total
volume of 100 uL, consisting of a 1:1 mix of 1x PBS and
Matrigel. Tumor volume was calculated as (L × W2)/2.
Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at 0.5 mg/kg.
Entinostat was administered intraperitoneally at
1 mg/kg. All other chemotherapeutics were administered
intraperitoneally. Vehicle for entinostat was 10% DMSO
in saline. All other vehicle injections were saline.
Injection volume was 5 mL/kg. Mean tumor growth
inhibition was calculated as TGI = (1-(Tf-T0)/(Cf-C0))*100,
where Tf and T0 represent final and initial mean tumor
volumes in the treatment arm, respectively, and Cf and
C0 represent final and initial mean tumor volumes in the
vehicle control arm, respectively.

Statistical analysis
ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test and
two-tailed unpaired t test were performed in Graphpad
Prism 5. For A549, H460, and LX7 xenograft experiments.
Linear mixed effects model with random intercept
was used to fit longitudinal tumor data. Group by time
interactions were used to compare tumor growth rates
between groups. All model parameters were estimated
through restricted maximum likelihood (REML) methods.

Xenografts established from pretreated cells
Seven days after epigenetic treatment (day 10), mock
and combination pretreated A549 and H460 cells were
harvested and counted, and 6.5 × 105 (A549) and 2.75 × 105
(H460) viable cells/mouse were injected into NOD/SCID
mice. Mice were added to study when tumors reached
250 mm3 (+/− 20%). A549 bearing mice were treated with
2 mg/kg cisplatin (days 2, 9, 16), 10 mg/kg irinotecan (days
2, 5, 9, 12, 16, 19), or vehicle (days 2, 5, 9, 12, 16, 19).
H460 bearing mice were treated with 2.5 mg/kg docetaxel
(q4d × 2) escalated to 5 mg/kg docetaxel (q4d × 2), 10 mg/kg
irinotecan (q4d × 4) or vehicle, starting on day 1.
