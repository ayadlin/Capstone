BACKGROUND: This randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial evaluated
the neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist casopitant mesylate in combination with ondansetron/dexamethasone
(ond/dex) for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) related to moderately
emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive patients who were receiving MEC (N ¼
723) were randomized to receive either oral placebo or casopitant at doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, or 150 mg
daily (on Days 1-3) plus ondansetron (on Days 1-3) and dexamethasone (Day 1). Two exploratory arms evaluated single-dose casopitant (150 mg) plus ond/dex and a 3-day casopitant regimen with once-daily
ondansetron and dexamethasone. Primary endpoints were rates of complete response (CR) (no vomiting,
retching, rescue therapy, or premature discontinuation) and significant nausea (SN) (25 mm on a visual
analog scale) over the first 120 hours after Cycle 1 of MEC. Secondary endpoints included acute and
delayed CR and SN rates, rates of nausea, vomiting, and safety. RESULTS: All casopitant doses that were
tested significantly increased the proportion of patients with CR: The CR rates were 80.8% with casopitant
50 mg, 78.5% with casopitant 100 mg, and 84.2% with casopitant 150 mg compared with 69.4% in the control group (P ¼ .0127); casopitant 150 mg was identified as the minimally effective dose. In exploratory analyses, single-dose casopitant demonstrated a 79.2% CR rate, and once-daily ondansetron plus casopitant
produced an 83.5% CR rate. Vomiting rates in the first 5 days after MEC were reduced with casopitant-containing regimens (from 23% to 10%-16%). Rates of SN did not differ among treatment arms (range, 28%-

The introduction of 5-hydroxytriptamine 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists into standard therapy for the prevention
of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV)
represented a significant advance; however, the prevention
and treatment of CINV remain clinically challenging. In a
prospective multinational study, 27.9% of patients who
received moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC)
experienced delayed vomiting despite antiemetic prophylaxis.1 In the community, patients’ quality of life and daily
functioning continue to be affected adversely by CINV
even when antiemetics are prescribed in accordance with
current clinical practice guidelines.2 There remains room for
improvement in the prevention of CINV in both the acute
phase (0-24 hours) and the delayed phase (24-120 hours).
Casopitant is a potent, selective neurokinin-1 (NK-1)
receptor antagonist with demonstrated antiemetic activity.3-6
In ferret models, a combination of casopitant and ondansetron was superior to either agent alone for the prevention of
acute cisplatin-induced emesis, but only casopitant was effective as a rescue treatment for established cisplatin-induced
emesis.3,4 Casopitant has been well tolerated in phase 1 clinical trials in single doses up to 150 mg and in phase 2 trials in
combination with ondansetron.5-7 In a phase 2 trial, patients
who received highly emetogenic, cisplatin-based chemotherapy experienced significantly higher complete response rates,
lower rates of vomiting, and a longer median time to first
emesis when casopitant was added to the prophylactic regimen relative to ondansetron/dexamethasone alone.6 The
current trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and sideeffect profile of several casopitant doses when administered
with ondansetron and dexamethasone for the prevention of
CINV over the first 5 days after administration of MEC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inclusion Criteria
Chemotherapy-naive patients aged >18 years with a malignant solid tumor who were scheduled to receive their
5808

first course of MEC were eligible for the trial. Eligible regimens included at least 1 of the following agents: cyclophosphamide from 500 mg/m2 to 1500 mg/m2 if given
with other MEC or from 750 mg/m2 to 1500 mg/m2 if
given alone or with agents that had minimal or low emetogenic potential, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, doxorubicin 60
mg/m2, epirubicin 90 mg/m2, irinotecan (dosed as part
of an irinotecan, leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil [FOLFIRI] regimen), or carboplatin at an area under the curve (AUC) 
5. Other inclusion criteria included a Karnofsky performance status score 70 and adequate hematologic and metabolic status, which we defined as white blood cells >3000/
mm3, absolute neutrophils >1500/mm3, platelets
>100,000/mm3, and serum creatinine <1.5 mg/dL. Eligible patients were required to have adequate liver function,
as demonstrated by laboratory values for aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase 2.5 times the
upper limit of normal in patients without known liver metastases or 5 times the upper limit of normal in patients
with liver metastases. All patients of childbearing potential
were required to use birth control.
Exclusion Criteria
Patients were not eligible if they had previously received
cytotoxic chemotherapy or an NK-1 receptor antagonist
or if they were scheduled to receive 1) highly emetogenic
chemotherapy, 2) adjuvant cyclophosphamide-based
chemotherapy, 3) bone marrow transplantation and/or
stem cell rescue with the current chemotherapy course, or
4) any medication of moderate or high emetogenic risk
within 48 hours of receiving study medication. Abdominal or pelvic radiation was not allowed from 7 days before
to 6 days after the initiation of study medication. Patients
who had known central nervous system metastases were
ineligible unless they were treated successfully with excision or radiation and had been stable for at least 1 week
before they received the first dose of study medication.
Patients who were receiving other antiemetics and
those who experienced emesis or clinically significant

excluded from the study. Systemic corticosteroid therapy
other than for taxane premedication was not to be initiated within 72 hours before the first dose of study medication. Opioid narcotics for cancer pain were permitted if
the dose had been stable for at least 7 days and if the
patient had not experienced nausea or emesis as a side
effect. Patients were ineligible if they had taken strong or
moderate inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)
and CYP3A5 within 2 to 14 days of the first dose of study
medication or inducers of CYP3A4 within 14 days of the

chemotherapy treatment (taxane-based or nontaxanebased). Patients in Group 1, the control arm, did not
receive casopitant. Groups 2, 3, and 4 (primary treatment
arms) and Group 6 (exploratory arm) received casopitant
for 3 consecutive days, whereas Group 5 (exploratory
arm) received casopitant only on Day 1. Groups 1
through 5 received ondansetron 8 mg orally twice daily,
whereas Group 6 received ondansetron 16 mg once daily.
All patients who did not receive steroid premedication for
taxane therapy received a single intravenous dose of dexamethasone 8 mg before MEC on Day 1.
All patients provided written informed consent
before participation in the trial. The study was conducted
in accordance with good clinical practice, all applicable
regulatory requirements, and the guiding principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki.

severity of nausea, if present. The Functional Living
Index-Emesis (FLIE) questionnaire was administered on
Day 1 and Day 6 of the trial to assess the impact of CINV
on activities of daily living during the 120-hour evaluation
phase. Patient satisfaction was assessed on Day 6 with a 5point Likert scale ranging from ‘‘very satisfied’’ to ‘‘very
dissatisfied.’’ Safety assessments were performed until the
end of the first cycle of MEC (Days 20-30) and included
the results of routine physical examination, vital
signs, electrocardiogram monitoring, routine clinical laboratory tests, clinical monitoring and/or observation, and
adverse event reporting. Adverse events were captured by
the study personnel, who telephoned patients daily on
Days 2 through 5 and graded events according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 3).

Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoints of the study were 1) the proportion of patients achieving a complete response (CR),
which was defined as no vomiting, no retching, no rescue
therapy, and no premature discontinuation from the
study, during the 120-hour evaluation period after the
first cycle of MEC; and 2) the proportion with SN, which
was defined as a maximum nausea score 25 mm on the
VAS, during the same period. Both endpoints were
assessed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.
The study had 90% power to detect a 20% difference in the overall CR rate between the control group
5810

(Group 1) and the group that received the highest dose of
casopitant (Group 4) with a 2-sided significance level of
.05 and assuming a predicted CR rate of 52% (Group 1)
and 72% (Group 4), which would require 100 evaluable
patients per arm. However, a 15% dropout rate was
assumed, and, in total, 118 patients were to be enrolled in
each study arm.
The 2 primary endpoints in this study were to be
tested hierarchically as follows: First, the dose-response
for CR was tested using a Cochran-Armitage test.8 If this
test was statistically significant, then the dose response for
SN (defined as a maximum nausea score 25 mm on the
VAS) would be tested.
Once a dose response had been determined for the
primary endpoint of CR at 120 hours, ordinal contrasts
were fit by excluding the highest dose until the test for linear trend was no longer statistically significant; the highest
dose at which the ordinal contrasts retained statistical significance was to be considered the ‘‘minimally effective
dose.’’ This analysis was repeated for SN at 120 hours. For
secondary endpoints, the primary treatment groups were
compared with Group 1 in a similar fashion. The study
was not powered based on secondary endpoints; thus,
there was no adjustment for multiplicity. Time-to-event
endpoints were summarized by using quartiles and the
associated 95% confidence intervals, and log-rank P values comparing all groups together and comparing each
treatment arm with placebo were calculated. Scores on the
FLIE were compared by using the Kruskal-Wallis test for
differences between treatments.

* Reported for at least 5% of patients in any treatment arm.

Secondary endpoints included CR rates and SN
rates during the acute phase (0-24 hours) and the delayed
phase (24-120 hours), and the rates of complete protection (CR plus maximum nausea <25 mm on the VAS),
total control (CR plus maximum nausea <5 mm on the
VAS), vomiting, and rescue medication use. The median
times to emesis and rescue medication use were
determined.

RESULTS
Population demographics were similar across all treatment groups (Table 2). The most common diagnoses
were breast cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, colorectal
cancer, and ovarian cancer. More women were enrolled
than men (60% and 40%, respectively). The average age
of all patients was 58 years, and the median time since diagnosis was 30 days. Carboplatin, which was the most freCancer

quently administered, moderately emetogenic agent, was
received by 384 patients (53%) overall. Dexamethasone
used as a premedication for paclitaxel or docetaxel or as a
rescue medication was balanced across treatment arms.

Efficacy
The proportion of patients in the ITT population who
achieved a CR at 120 hours ranged from 69.4% in Group
1 (control arm) to 84.2% in Group 4 (casopitant 150 mg
daily for 3 days), and a significant overall dose response
was established through Cochran-Armitage trend testing
(P ¼ .0127). Testing for a linear trend for doses from
0 mg to 100 mg did not achieve significance (P ¼ .0846),
thereby establishing the 3-day 150 mg daily dose as the
minimally effective dose (ordinal contrast; P ¼ .0127).

* Patients who did not have a CR in the acute phase were considered as not having a CR in the delayed phase.

The greatest benefit from the addition of casopitant
to the prophylactic regimen was observed in the delayed
phase, in which the CR rate was 69.4% for Group 1 versus
80.8% for Group 2, 78.5% for Group 3, and 84.2% for
Group 4 (P ¼ .0127). There were no differences among
Groups 1 through 4 for the second primary endpoint,
SN. From 0 hours to 120 hours, the rates of SN were
28.9% in Group 1, 27.5% in Group 2, 29.8% in Group
3, and 28.3% in Group 4 (P ¼ .0983).
In the exploratory analyses, Group 5 (single-dose
casopitant regimen) produced a numerically higher
CR rate relative to Group 1 (control) overall and in
the delayed phase (Table 3). The absolute treatment
benefit approached 10%, and the lower limit of the
95% confidence interval approached zero for each
time point (mean difference, 9.7%; 95% confidence
interval, 1.2 to 20.7). Results in Group 6 were similar to those in Group 4, suggesting that ondansetron
16 mg given once daily with casopitant could be a
convenient alternative to twice-daily dosing. For SN,
the 34.2% overall incidence rate in Group 5 was not
significantly different from that in Group 1 (28.9%),
and the 30.6% rate in Group 6 was consistent with
the rates in both Group 1 and Group 4 (28.9% and
28.3%, respectively).
5812

Significant dose-response relations were not
observed for rates of complete protection, total control, or
nausea (Table 4). However, there was a significant doseresponse relation for vomiting both overall and in the
delayed phase (P ¼ .0251 and P ¼ .0069, respectively)
(Table 4). Each ordinal contrast was statistically significant, indicating the effectiveness of all casopitant regimens
in the reduction of vomiting relative to Group 1 in the
delayed phase. There also was a significant difference in
favor of casopitant in the time to first emesis (P ¼ .0401)
(Fig. 2). Hazard ratios for first emesis relative to Group 1
were 0.487 for Group 2 (pairwise Wald test; P ¼ .0278),
0.668 for Group 3 (P ¼ .1752), and 0.448 for Group 4 (P
¼ .0169).
Less than 10% of patients on each arm received
rescue medication during the evaluation period (7.4%
in Group 1 vs 5.8% in Group 2, 3.3% in Group 3, and
5% in Group 4). There were no differences in the time to
first rescue medication use across groups (P ¼ .5466).
Rescue medication was received by 5 patients in Group 5
(4.2%) and by 7 patients in Group 6 (5.8%) over 0 to
120 hours.
There were no significant differences on FLIE scores
for CINV, nausea, or vomiting in the ITT population for
Groups 1 through 4 (data not shown). For all 6 treatment

groups, the majority of patients (>60%) described themselves as ‘‘very satisfied’’ with the antiemetic prophylactic
regimen in the patient satisfaction questionnaire.
Subgroup analyses were specified in the protocol
to examine the results by sex and by type of chemotherapy (taxane-based vs nontaxane-based). The results
of these analyses generally were consistent with the
overall results. Rates of CR at 120 hours among men
were 70.8% in Group 1, 83% in Group 2, 87.5% in
Group 3, and 83.3% in Group 4, whereas, among
women, the rates were 68.5%, 79.5%, 72.6%, and

who received nontaxane-based regimens. In those who
received taxane-based therapy, a CR was reported in
71.4% of Group 1, 85.4% of Group 2, 80.5% of
Group 3, and 82.9% of Group 4. Those who received
nontaxane-based regimens experienced similar complete
responses: 68.4% of Group 1, 78.5% of Group 2,
77.5% of Group 3, and 84.8% of Group 4.

Safety
The safety population consisted of the 711 patients who
received at least 1 dose of study medication in any treatment cycle. The most frequently reported adverse
events—nausea, anemia, fatigue, constipation, neutropenia, and vomiting—generally appeared to be balanced
across study arms. Fewer patients in Groups 2 through 6
reported vomiting than in Group 1, and more patients in
Group 3 reported nausea and anorexia than in the other
groups; however, there were no notable differences among
treatment arms for overall adverse event frequency. Seventy-eight patients experienced at least 1 serious adverse
event, and there were 20 deaths in this study, none of
which were considered by the investigator to be related to
study medication (Table 5). The incidence of adverse
events leading to discontinuation was low and was balanced across the study arms.

DISCUSSION
This large international trial was conducted to assess
the efficacy and side-effect profile of different doses
of the NK-1 antagonist casopitant when added to a
standard antiemetic regimen for the prevention of
CINV in chemotherapy-naive patients who were
receiving MEC. At the time that this trial was initiated, the standard of care for the prevention of
CINV was a combination of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist plus a corticosteroid; therefore, the dual regimen
was used as a control.9-11 Since that time, both the
American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer
have revised their guidelines to reflect a triple-drug
regimen with a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, a corticosteroid, and the NK-1 antagonist aprepitant as the
standard of care for patients who are receiving certain
MECs.11-13
The population in the current trial comprised
patients with a broad range of tumor types (breast cancer,
nonsmall cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and ovarian
cancer) who were receiving a variety of chemotherapeutic
regimens with moderate emetogenicity. In the primary
analysis, a statistically significant dose-response relation
was demonstrated for the primary endpoint: the CR rate
over the first 5 days after chemotherapy administration.

Casopitant to Prevent CINV After MEC/Arpornwirat et al

This composite endpoint was defined rigorously as no
vomiting, no retching, no rescue therapy, and no premature discontinuation from the study. Each casopitant dose
demonstrated clinical activity, and absolute improvements in CR at 120 hours ranged from approximately
10% to 15% relative to the control arm. Clinical activity
was not affected by sex or by the type of chemotherapy
(taxane-based vs nontaxane-based). Although it was active
in the acute phase, the greatest clinical benefit related to
casopitant was observed in the delayed phase. In an exploratory arm, a single dose of casopitant added to the
prophylactic regimen on Day 1 appeared to be as effective
as the 3-day regimens.
A significant dose-response relation was not noted
for SN (maximum score 25 on the VAS), which was the
other primary endpoint of the trial. In addition, rates of
nausea (score 5 on the VAS) did not differ among the 6
treatment arms overall or in the acute phase. Approximately 40% to 50% of patients in this study experienced
nausea at some point after chemotherapy administration,
highlighting the need for further research into the pathogenesis of chemotherapy-induced nausea.
Rates of vomiting were reduced significantly with
casopitant treatment both overall and in the delayed
phase. Approximately 90% of patients who were randomized to receive casopitant therapy did not vomit in the
delayed phase, and there was an absolute improvement
over the control arm of approximately 10%. Each 3-day
casopitant regimen produced a statistically significant
improvement in vomiting rates relative to control in the
delayed phase. Statistical comparisons were not made
between the exploratory arms and controls; however, the
vomiting rates in Groups 5 and 6 were consistent with the
rates in the other casopitant arms.
Treatment with casopitant generally was well tolerated. The most commonly reported adverse events generally were consistent with side effects related to
chemotherapy, such as fatigue, anemia, neutropenia, and
alopecia.
In summary, across the different doses that we studied, an antiemetic regimen of combined casopitant,
ondansetron, and dexamethasone provided a significant
reduction in the number of patients who experienced
CINV events over the first 5 days after MEC relative to
the ondansetron/dexamethasone regimen alone and
appeared to be well tolerated. It is noteworthy that casopiCancer

tant produced significant improvements in the prevention
of CINV in this broad population of men and women
with different tumor types who received a variety of chemotherapeutic regimens. A single-day casopitant regimen
provided benefit in the prevention of CINV equal to the
benefit that was provided by the 3-day regimens that were
evaluated in this trial. These regimens are being evaluated
in recently completed phase 3 trials.
