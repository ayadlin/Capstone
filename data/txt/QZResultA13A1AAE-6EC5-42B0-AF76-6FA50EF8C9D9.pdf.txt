ABSTRACT:
Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-1 (STAT1) is phosphorylated
upon interferon (IFN) stimulation, which can restrict cell proliferation and survival.
Nevertheless, in some cancers STAT1 can act in an anti-apoptotic manner. Moreover,
certain malignancies are characterized by the overexpression and constitutive
activation of STAT1. Here, we demonstrate that the treatment of transformed
hematopoietic cells with epigenetic drugs belonging to the class of histone deacetylase
inhibitors (HDACi) leads to the cleavage of STAT1 at multiple sites by caspase-3 and
caspase-6. This process does not occur in solid tumor cells, normal hematopoietic
cells, and leukemic cells that underwent granulocytic or monocytic differentiation.
STAT1 cleavage was studied under cell free conditions with purified STAT1 and a set
of candidate caspases as well as with mass spectrometry. These assays indicate that
unmodified STAT1 is cleaved at multiple sites by caspase-3 and caspase-6. Our study
shows that STAT1 is targeted by caspases in malignant undifferentiated hematopoietic
cells. This observation may provide an explanation for the selective toxicity of HDACi
against rapidly proliferating leukemic cells.

INTRODUCTION

of the homo- and heterodimers. These translocate into the
nucleus, where they alter gene expression patterns [1].
Moreover, Stark and coworkers showed that STAT1 and
STAT3 can modulate gene expression independent of their
phosphorylation status [2].
Seven STAT proteins have been identified in
mammals: STAT1, -2, -3, -4, -5a, -5b, and -6 [3, 4]. STAT1
has a primary role in IFN-mediated cell signaling and is
important for processes like cell proliferation, survival,
and immunological control [5]. While STAT1 can act as
a tumor suppressor, an oncogenic potential of STAT1 has
been shown in certain cellular contexts [6]. Furthermore,

STAT proteins control the development and
homeostasis of metazoans [1]. STATs are latent
transcription factors that reside in the cytoplasm until
they are activated by extracellular ligands. These are
e.g., cytokines, growth factors, and hormones. Binding
of these ligands allows the multimerization of their
receptors. Subsequently, Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) are
recruited to the cytoplasmic domains of these receptors
and become activated by phosphorylation. JAKs directly
phosphorylate STATs leading to a conformational switch

STAT1 overexpression is found in many leukemic cells
and in some solid cancers [7]. Moreover, overexpressed,
unphosphorylated STAT1 regulates a different subset
of genes than phosphorylated STAT1, and these genes
are often related to tumorigenesis [8, 9]. Hematopoietic
cells are key cells of the immune system, which makes
it important to analyze the stability of STAT1 in HDACitreated normal and transformed blood cells.
Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is a critical
barrier to tumorigenesis [10]. During apoptosis, activated
caspases are the main executor enzymes that selectively
cleave proteins. They are a multifunctional, highly
conserved enzyme family. Caspases harbor a cysteine
residue in their active center and cleave selectively after
aspartate residues [11, 12]. Caspases are synthesized as
immature zymogens requiring specific proteolysis for
activation [13]. They can be generally subdivided into two
classes. Initiator caspases are activated upon recruitment
to multi-protein complexes like death receptors (caspase-8
and caspase-10) or the apoptosome (caspase-9). These
caspases activate executioner or effector caspases [14],
which cleave various proteins to allow cellular demise
[12, 15]. In addition, several non-apoptotic functions of
caspases have been identified in the last years, which
indicates that these enzymes play important roles in
cellular differentiation and proliferation [16]. Recent
studies show that the activation of caspases also leads to
selective protein degradation independent of apoptosis in
hematopoietic cells [17].
The signaling of STAT1 is well studied but only a
few analyses concerning the degradation and recycling of
STAT1 were done. Kim and Maniatis reported that STAT1
becomes ubiquitinylated after IFNγ stimulation [18].
Other studies also show that STAT1 can be ubiquitinylated
and degraded by the proteasome to restrict IFN-dependent
JAK-STAT signaling [19, 20]. Remarkably, some
pathogens like the SV5 or Mumps virus inactivate STAT1
via the induction of its proteasomal degradation [21, 22].
On the other hand, there is a positive feed-back loop on
STAT1 expression, with IFNs activating STAT1 and the
subsequent binding of STAT1 to its own promoter [23-25].
Little is known about the cellular turnover of
STAT1 in uninduced cells. So far, STAT1 was identified
as a caspase-3 target in HeLa cells [26]. Treatment with
staurosporine, as classical apoptosis inducer, resulted in
a C-terminally truncated STAT1 protein (STAT1γ) unable
to induce IFN signaling. A complete in vitro degradation
of STAT1 by caspase-3 was shown in cell-free extracts
prepared from Jurkat cells which were treated with 50
mg/ml cytochrome c and 1mM dATP [27]. The above
named studies indicate that STAT1 can be a substrate of
caspase-3. However, it has not been formally addressed if
caspases other than caspase-3 cleave STAT1 in cells.
HDACs are epigenetic modulators that catalyze
the deacetylation of lysine residues [28]. Inhibition of
these enzymes with HDACi modulates several functions
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the immune system. Of note, STAT1 signaling is not
exclusively regulated by phosphorylation, but equally
by acetylation [29]. Several studies show that HDACi
modulate the acetylation of STAT1 and its transcriptional
activity [30, 31]. The treatment of cells with HDACi
alters protein degradation, signaling, gene expression, and
apoptosis [32-34]. Accordingly, HDACi also are potent
apoptosis inducers in certain cell types [28]. While HDACi
block IFN-dependent STAT1 signaling, STAT1 expression
is increased in melanoma and other solid cancer-derived
cells when they are incubated with HDACi [25, 31, 35,
36].
We addressed whether HDACi affect the stability of
STAT1 in leukemic cells and in normal blood cells. Our
data show that treatment with HDACi induces apoptosis
and allows the cleavage and degradation of STAT1.
Furthermore, we reveal that STAT1 is a direct target of
caspase-3 and caspase-6 in undifferentiated leukemic
cells. Hormonally and chemically induced differentiation
protects transformed cells from apoptosis involving the
caspase-dependent processing of STAT1. The same holds
true for normal blood cells. These results provide further
understanding to the differential response of normal and
leukemic cells to HDACi.

RESULTS
The expression of STAT1 in NB4 cells is reduced
upon exposure to the HDACi butyrate.
To determine whether HDACi affect the expression
and activity of STAT1 in leukemic cells, we treated NB4
acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells with butyrate,
a naturally occurring HDACi. We found that butyrate
treatment significantly reduces STAT1 levels in NB4 cells
(Figure 1A). Since all STAT proteins share a high degree
of homology [4], we also examined STAT2 and STAT3
protein levels in butyrate-treated cells. Whereas STAT2
was even slightly induced, STAT3 seemed to be unaffected
by HDACi (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure 1.1).
Thus, of the STATs tested, specifically STAT1 becomes
reduced after exposure of NB4 cells to butyrate.
The HDACi-induced attenuation of STAT1 is
unexpected, as HDACi treatment results in an induction
of STAT1 mRNA and protein levels in solid tumor derived
cells [25, 31, 35, 36]. Therefore, we compared the effect
of butyrate on various lymphoid and myeloid leukemia
cells and on solid tumor-derived cells. Whereas butyrate
reduces STAT1 in leukemia cells (Figure 1B), most solid
tumor-derived cells show an induction of STAT1 after
treatment (Supplemental Figure 1.2).
Since HDACi can activate caspases and the
apoptotic program [37, 38], we tested whether butyrate
has a pro-apoptotic effect on NB4 cells. A loss of full2306

length caspase-3 indicates its activation, i.e. the cleavage
from the precursor into the active enzyme. An additional
control for caspase activation is the detection of its cleaved
substrates [11, 12]. These can for example be the DNA
repair enzyme PARP1 and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90),
both being direct targets of caspases in apoptotic NB4
cells [39]. Cleavage products of HSP90 and PARP1 can
be detected in butyrate-treated NB4 cells (Supplemental
Figure 1.1). In addition, the protein levels of mutant
p53 become reduced (Figure 1A) and). Accordingly, the
levels of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-XL and BCL-2,
which are positively regulated by mutant p53 [40, 41], are
reduced in NB4 cells exposed to butyrate (Figure 1A and
Supplemental Figure 1.1).
The HDACi butyrate induces significant amounts
of apoptosis in NB4 cell cultures (Figure 1C). Apoptotic
DNA fragmentation below a DNA content of 2N (SubG1
fraction of fixed cells) is detected in 32.4%+/-3.1%
of the cells treated with 1.5 mM butyrate for 24 hours.
Furthermore, 35.6%+/-1.7% of Annexin V-positive, i.e.
apoptotic cells can be measured by AnnexinV/PI staining

of unfixed cells (Figure 1D).
Data provided in Figure 1 show that STAT1
expression can be reduced by butyrate in leukemia cells.
This loss of STAT1 appears to be linked induction of
apoptosis by HDACi.

Butyrate-induced downregulation of STAT1
correlates with apoptosis.
Next, we investigated at which concentrations
butyrate reduces STAT1 protein expression and whether
this process can be correlated with the induction of
apoptosis. Western blot experiments demonstrated that
STAT1 degradation starting at a concentration of 1 mM
butyrate (Figure 2A). Conversion of full-length caspase-3
and PARP1 cleavage can also be seen at this and higher
concentrations of butyrate. In order to test for HDACi
efficacy, we analyzed hyperacetylation of histones.
Both, the induction of cell death as well as histone
hyperacetylation correlate with the loss of STAT1 in NB4
cells exposed to butyrate (Figure 2A).

or stimulated with NaB for 24 hours. Amounts of STAT1, caspase-3 full-length (fl.), PARP full- length and PARP cleaved form and the

described in Figure 1C(means +/- SE; n=3; **p <0.01).F) NB4 cells were stimulated with 1.5 mM NaB at the indicated intervals. After 24

FACS analyses revealed that butyrate leads to an
increase of the apoptotic cell fraction in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 2B) and MTT assays show that butyrate
reduces cell viability of NB4 cells (Figure 2C). Increasing
concentrations of butyrate has little additional effect;
from 1.5 mM on a plateau in cell death, PARP1 cleavage,
histone hyperacetylation, and loss of STAT1 expression is
reached (Figure 2A-C).
We then determined the kinetics of STAT1
degradation in butyrate-treated cells with time course
experiments for up to 24 hours. While the treatment with
1.5 mM butyrate for up to eight hours has no significant
effect on STAT1 expression, treatment lasting from 12
hours on reduces STAT1 expression. Together with STAT1
degradation, caspase-3 cleavage indicating its activation
can be observed. STAT2 again remained stable in the
presence of butyrate (Figure 2D).
In NB4 cells STAT1 becomes clearly reduced after
12 hours of butyrate exposure. We determined whether this
process is associated with apoptosis. FACS data showed
that, from a 12 hour treatment period on, butyrate starts to
cause cell death (Figure 2E). Additionally, we performed
an MTT assay to analyze the butyrate effect on NB4 cell
viability at various time points and doses. Cells stopped
proliferation and underwent apoptosis and this correlated
with the degradation of STAT1 (Figure 2C and 2F).
These findings demonstrate that STAT1 levels are
reduced time- and dose-dependently by butyrate treatment
and this effect correlates with the induction of apoptosis.
This effect begins after 12 hours of treatment, indicating
that the butyrate-induced STAT1 loss is most likely an
indirect effect.

to butyrate treatment seems to be a general mechanism
(Figure 3C).
The cleavage of proteins by caspases often leads
to the appearance of protein fragments [12, 15]. We
used several antibodies to detect such protein fragments
of STAT1. Immunoblot data shown in Figures 1 and 2
were collected with a monoclonal anti-STAT1 antibody
directed against the STAT1 C-terminus (Figure 3D).
Since a C-terminal cleavage of STAT1 has been described
[42], we also probed immunoblots with an antibody
directed against more N-terminal residues (Figure 3D).
This antibody (termed STAT1 SH2) revealed a fragment
of STAT1 in addition to full-length STAT1 in NB4 cells
exposed to butyrate (Figure 3E).
We did some additional tests to clarify whether other
proteases contribute to the degradation of STAT1 in NB4
cells treated with butyrate. Various protease inhibitors
could not prevent STAT1 degradation (Supplemental
Figure S2.1). Since HDACi also induce proteasomedependent protein degradation [33, 43], we tested whether
the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin protects STAT1 from
butyrate. This inhibitor could though not prevent STAT1
reduction (Supplemental Figure S2.2). The E3 ubiquitinprotein ligase RLIM is degraded by the proteasome after
HDACi exposure [39]. The rescue of the butyrate-induced
loss of RLIM by lactacystin served as control and verified
the potency of the lactacystin batch (Supplemental Figure
S2.2).
To test whether STAT1 degradation through
treatment with butyrate requires de novo protein
synthesis, experiments with the protein-synthesis inhibitor
cycloheximide (CHX) in combination with butyrate were
performed. After 24 hours, STAT1 protein levels were
determined. Western blot analyses showed that treatment
with butyrate as well as with CHX leads to reduced STAT1
levels after 24 hours (Supplemental Figure S2.3). These
findings agree with STAT1 having a half-life between
12 and 24 hours [44, 45] and with the auto-regulatory
control of STAT1 expression at the level of the STAT1
promoter [23, 24]. The combination of cycloheximide and
butyrate leads to a further reduction. Therefore, protein
biosynthesis of an additional factor may not be required
for the degradation of STAT1 in response to butyrate
(Supplemental Figure S2.4). This is plausible as caspases
are already present as precursors until they are activated.
Based on these data, we propose that STAT1 is a
target of caspases during the HDACi-induced apoptosis.

Caspases cleave STAT1 in apoptotic cells
Our data suggest that butyrate promotes a caspase
dependent processing of STAT1 in leukemic cells. In
order to ascertain these findings, we blocked these
enzymes with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK
[12]. We pre-treated NB4 cells with Z-VAD-FMK and
then added butyrate. FACS analyses of NB4 cells showed
that Z-VAD-FMK significantly inhibits the butyrateinduced chromatin fragmentation (Figure 3A) as well as
the cleavage of caspase-3 giving rise to its active form
(Figure 3B). Of note, Western blot analyses revealed that
Z-VAD-FMK blocks the degradation of STAT1 evoked by
butyrate (Figure 3B). Detection of hyperacetylated histone
H3 verified that the efficacy of butyrate is unaffected by
Z-VAD-FMK.
Curiously, incubation of untreated NB4 cells with
Z-VAD-FMK resulted in a slight increase in STAT1
protein levels. Hence, also the basal turnover of STAT1 is
regulated by caspases in NB4 cells (Figure 3B).
The same effects were seen in the leukemia cell lines
Kasumi-1, BV-173, and SD1. These findings illustrate that

Caspase-3 and Caspase-6 cleave STAT1
It is known that the immunodepletion of caspase-6
from apoptotic lysates cannot prevent the cleavage of
STAT1 [27]. However, it has not been addressed whether
caspase-6 may directly attack STAT1. To determine more
thoroughly which caspase(s) can cleave STAT1 directly,
we utilized GST-STAT1 as a substrate for the recombinant

caspases 1, -3, -4, -6, -7, -8, and -9. Of the tested caspases,
only caspase-3 and -6 cleave STAT1 at 1 U per reaction,
yielding truncated fragments (Figure 4A; fragments
marked with arrows), and this cleavage was inhibited by

the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK as well as by heat
shock inactivation of the enzymes (Supplemental Figure
4.1).
To clarify whether STAT1 is also cleaved in vivo

or “XXXD” sequence motifs; at amino acids 142, 167,
170, 694 with high probability (Figure 4C, supplement
3.1, supplement 3.2).
Therefore, we generated single mutants of the
potential cleavage sites within STAT1 and performed an in
vitro cleavage assay with caspase-3 and caspase-6. None
of these STAT1 mutants was resistant to cleavage by these
caspases (supplemental Figure 4.2), confirming the above
mentioned in silico data illustrating that STAT1 contains
more than one caspase cleavage site.
To verify the presence of multiple caspase cleavage
sites in STAT1, we expressed and purified His-tagged
STAT1 domains and repeated the in vitro caspase cleavage
assay with recombinant caspase-3 and -6. The results
revealed that STAT1 has caspase cleavage sites in the
coiled-coiled domain, the DNA-binding domain as well
as in the transactivation domain, and that both caspases
are able to cleave STAT1 under these conditions (Figure

by caspase-3 and -6, we preincubated NB4 cells with
cell permeable inhibitors for caspase-3 (zDEVD-FMK)
or caspase-6 (zVEID-FMK), and treated the cells with
butyrate (Figure 4B). Each of these caspase inhibitors
prevented STAT1 cleavage, suggesting a critical role of
caspase-3 and caspase-6 for the cleavage of STAT1.
Western blot analysis of cell extracts from NB4 cells
revealed that the decrease in total STAT1 protein levels
ties in with the appearance of one cleavage fragment
of STAT1 (Figure 3E). However, recombinant STAT1
became cleaved into more fragments by caspases and
these fragments could not be identified by antibodies (data
not shown). Therefore, we concluded that multiple STAT1
fragments were generated as a consequence of caspase
activation. Examination of the amino acid sequence of
STAT1 with the GraBCas software and the CASVM server
[46, 47] showed that STAT1 contains several potential
cleavage sites being characterized by “DXXD,” “VXXD,”

4D). These findings verify the above predicted absence
of cleavage sites in its N-terminal domain and in the SH2
domain. Moreover, the data support the notion that STAT1
contains several caspase cleavage sites. Mass spectroscopy
studies as well as Edman sequencing were performed with
selected bands resulting from cleavage assays with GST
tagged full length STAT1. These experiments verified that
STAT1 is processed at multiple sites by caspase-3 and
caspase-6 (supplemental Figure 4.3 4.4 and 4.5). Thus,
STAT1 is a bona fide target of these enzymes.

primary cells are resistant to the induction of apoptosis by
HDACi.

DISCUSSION
STAT1 is overexpressed or constitutively activated
in some types of leukemia and this can correlate with a
bad prognosis for the patients [51, 52]. Therefore, there
may be situations in which a more long term or permanent
loss of STAT1 is beneficial. Previously, it was shown that
apoptosis induced by exposure to etoposide resulted in
a C-terminally truncated form of STAT1 [26]. Caspases
were found to mediate this process in HeLa cells. Here,
we report the cleavage of STAT1 by caspases in NB4
cells exposed to HDACi (Figures 1 and 2). We performed
experiments with the HDACi butyrate, LBH-589 and MS275, which have been described to induce apoptosis via the
extrinsic as well as the intrinsic pathway (data not shown)
[28, 53-55]. Depending on the nature of the apoptosisinducing agent, different caspases are activated and this
possibly results in diverse STAT1 cleavage patterns.
Our data show that STAT1 is cleaved by the executioner
caspases 3 and 6, generating multiple STAT1 fragments in
NB4 cells exposed to butyrate (Figure 4A). This cleavage
process can be prevented by blocking the enzymatic
activities of caspase-3 and caspase-6 (Figure 4B). Whereas
in some solid cancer cell lines STAT1 protein expression
is induced after HDACi treatment, STAT1 is known
to be acetylated and inactivated by HDACi [30]. Since
leukemia cells are very sensitive to HDACi, in contrast
to many cells derived from solid tumors, the cell type and
perhaps the cellular context may determine the activation
of distinct caspases and the impact on STAT1 signaling.
STAT1 and STAT3 share high similarity [30].
STAT3 is cleaved by caspases in prostate cancer cells
generating multiple STAT3 protein fragments [56]. These
STAT3 fragments retain transcriptional activity. We could
show in in vitro cleavage assays that STAT1 is cleaved
at several sites (Figure 4D and Supplemental Figure
4.3). The generated specific STAT1 cleavage products
may contribute to STAT1 dependent gene expression in
cells. This mechanism could represent a novel mechanism
that links the activity of caspases to non-apoptotic cell
functions. Further studies are required to find out whether
caspase-generated STAT1 fragments play a role in gene
transcription similar to those of STAT3
Several non-apoptotic functions of caspases have
been identified in the last years, which indicate that
caspases play an important role in cell differentiation
and proliferation. Recent studies show that activation of
caspases may selectively inactivate transcription factors,
regulatory proteins and enzymes. For example, caspase-6
is able to cleave 5-lipoxygenase in B lymphocytic cells
under non-apoptotic conditions [57]. Furthermore,

Butyrate leads to STAT1 degradation in leukemia
cells but not in primary and differentiated cells
NB4 cells are promyelocytes that retain the
bilineage potential. They are capable of maturation along
the monocyte/macrophage lineage after phorbol myristate
acetate (PMA) treatment or along the granulocytic
maturation after induction with all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA) [48]. NB4 cell differentiation can be monitored
by measuring the expression of the markers CD11b and
CD14 on the cell surface. High levels of CD11b can be
found after differentiation induced by ATRA, CD14 is
increased upon differentiation by PMA (Figure 5A). NB4
cells were preincubated for 24 hours with ATRA or PMA
and subsequently stimulated for 24 hours with butyrate
or staurosporine, an apoptosis inducing agent [49, 50].
ATRA as well as PMA abolished the degradation of
STAT1 by butyrate but not by staurosporine, indicating
that differentiation specifically desensitizes cells against
butyrate. Furthermore, caspase-3 cleavage was not
detectable in NB4 cells treated with ATRA or PMA
plus butyrate. In contrast, we could not identify any
difference for staurosporine-induced STAT1 cleavage in
undifferentiated and differentiated cells. In conclusion, we
reason that undifferentiated cells have a higher sensitivity
to the HDACi butyrate, which leads to a strong activation
of caspases subsequently degrading STAT1 (Figure 5B).
So far, our data demonstrate that caspase-mediated
STAT1 cleavage exclusively occurs in leukemia cell lines.
Next, we tested if this effect could be observed in primary
material. We assessed the HDACi sensitivity of human
CD4-postive T cells and of a fraction of mono nuclear cells
(MNCs). Surprisingly, in these cells there was no STAT1
reduction with 1.5 mM butyrate applied for 24 hours
(Figure 5C). Even higher concentrations had no influence
(supplemental Figure 5.1). To investigate this unexpected
finding, we checked for caspase-3 cleavage in primary T
cells and MNCs. Indeed, HDACi did not lead to caspase-3
activation. To assess the possibility that these agents may
not be able to affect caspase-3 in primary cells, we treated
them with staurosporine and measured caspase-3 activities
in whole cell extracts. Staurosporine but not HDACi, like
butyrate or VPA, activate caspase-3 and caspase-6 in T
cells and MNCs (Figure 5D). Therefore, we conclude that

or overexpression of anti-apoptotic factors results in an
abnormal development of cells [58]. The list of substrates
cleaved by caspases under apoptotic and non-apoptotic
conditions is still growing.
Both, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK as
well as the caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK allow the
accumulation of STAT1 in NB4 cells. These data show for
the first time that caspases control the stability of STAT1
in resting hematopoietic cells. We provide evidence
suggesting that STAT1 is cleaved by caspases under
apoptotic as well as under non-apoptotic conditions.
IFNs are commonly used as a therapy for cancer [5961]. Consequently, STAT1 has been categorized as a proapoptotic factor within the IFNα/γ-dependent signaling
cascades [62, 63]. Accordingly, studies with STAT1-/- mice
show that the loss of STAT1 increases the incidence of
breast tumors [60]. Nevertheless, recent studies illustrate
an ambivalent character of STAT1 [6, 64] and STAT1
can even accelerate the development of hematopoietic
tumors independent of IFN signaling [8]. Interestingly,
the upregulation of MHC class I molecules which is
promoted by STAT1, represents a general mechanism
how leukemic cells can escape tumor surveillance by
natural killer cells in mice [6]. We consistently found
that treating NB4 cells with butyrate causes a significant
downregulation of the mRNA levels of HLA-A and HLA-B
(Supplemental Figure 5.2). Truly, the cellular context
may determine whether STAT1 acts as tumor promoter
or as a tumor suppressor. The reduced levels of STAT1
caused by specific caspase cleavage may have an impact
on the immune response and this could also affect cancer
development. Our observations demonstrate that STAT1 is
targeted by caspases upon HDACi treatment of leukemic
cells. HDACi exposure of primary blood cells fails to
induce caspase activation and STAT1 reduction (Figure
5C). These data may help to explain the beneficial effects
of HDACi on tumor cells while sparing non-transformed
cells [28].
In conclusion, HDACi induce the proteolytic
processing of STAT1 by caspase-3 and caspase-6 in
leukemic cells. This process is associated with the
formation of several STAT1 cleavage fragments and it
has implications on STAT1 target gene expression. The
caspase-mediated processing of STAT1 under apoptotic
and non-apoptotic conditions may represent an additional
mechanism to modulate STAT1 signaling.
