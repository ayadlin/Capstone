ABSTRACT
Anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 plays an important role in protecting cell from death
in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The apoptosis blocking activity of Mcl-1 is inhibited
by BH3-only protein Noxa. We found that dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and its derivative
X-11 are potent apoptosis inducers in AML cells and act through a Noxa-mediate
pathway; X-11 is four-fold more active than DHA. DHA and X-11-induced apoptosis
is associated with induction of Noxa; apoptosis is blocked by silencing Noxa. DHA
and X-11 induce Noxa expression by upregulating the transcription factor FOXO3a
in a reactive oxygen species-mediated pathway. Interfering with the integrity of the
endoperoxide moiety of DHA and X-11, as well as chelating intracellular iron with
deferoxamine, diminish apoptosis and Noxa induction. AML cells expressing Bcl-xL,
or with overexpression of Bcl-2, have decreased sensitivity to DHA and X-11-induced
apoptosis which could be overcome by addition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT-737.
DHA and X-11 represent a new group of AML cells-apoptosis inducing compounds
which work through Noxa up-regulation utilizing the specific endoperoxide moiety
and intracellular iron.

INTRODUCTION

chemotherapy. Increased levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and/or
Mcl-1 have been found to predict poor prognosis of AML
patients to chemotherapy [6-8]. Although agents targeting
Bcl-2/Bcl-xL have been developed [9], the effect of Bcl-2/
Bcl-xL inhibitors was hindered by basal and/or increased
expression of Mcl-1 [10]. Molecular studies revealed
that Mcl-1 plays an even more important role than Bcl-2/
Bcl-xL in protecting AML cells from apoptosis [11] and,
therefore, agents inhibiting Mcl-1 need to be developed.
Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from
the sweet wormwood Artemisia annua L and is being
used as an antimalarial agent [12]. Artemisinin, its ester
and ether have been reported to have antitumor effects
[13]. The anti-proliferative effects of these artemisinin
analogues were tested in National Cancer Institute (NCI)
60 cell line panel which were clustered into three response

Acute myeloid leukemia is a disease of malignant
proliferation of hematopoietic cells with disrupted
differentiation and apoptotic program. Chemotherapy
remains the main therapy and the therapeutic outcome
of AML has not been significantly improved during the
last forty years. Molecular and cellular genetic analyses in
AML revealed many potential signaling pathways which
have been used to develop therapeutic agents [1, 2], but so
far only limited clinic activities have been achieved [3, 4].
It seems that agents selectively inducing cell death would
be more effective for AML treatment. Mitochondrialmediated apoptosis, controlled by the anti-apoptotic
protein Bcl-2 family, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 [5], was
thought to be the main mechanism of AML cell killing by

groups with leukemia cells being the most responsive [13,
14]. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is an active metabolite
of arteminisin analogues and has been shown to induce
apoptosis in AML cells [15, 16]. To improve the antileukemia activity of DHA we have synthesized a series
of derivatives substituted with a chalcone or a piperazine
[17]. DHA derivatives substituted with a chalcone showed
improved anti-proliferative ability over DHA and also
induced apoptosis in AML HL-60 cells [17]. We also
found that DHA derivatives substituted with a piperazine
were more potent than DHA in induction of apoptosis in
HL-60 cells. Although several factors have been found to
contribute to DHA-induced apoptosis, the mechanism of
action is unclear. In this study we selected one of the most
active derivatives, X-11 (10-O-[4-(1-acetyl-5-phenyl-4,
5-dihydropyrazol-3-yl) phenyl]-(10S)-dihydroartemisinin,
Fig. 1A), and DHA to compare their apoptosis induction
abilities and to investigate the mechanism of action in
several AML cell lines. We found that up-regulation of
BH3-only protein Noxa, by inactivating Mcl-1, plays an
important role in DHA and X-11-induced apoptosis. This

effect relies on the endoperoxide moiety of DHA and X-11
as well as the intracellular iron of AML cells.

RESULTS
X-11 induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells more
potently than DHA and this effect is associated
with the induction of Noxa
HL-60 cells were treated with several concentrations
of DHA or X-11 for 12, 18 and 24 h and apoptotic cells
were measured based on morphological changes after
staining with acridine orange (AO) and ethidium bromide
(EB). X-11 was more potent than DHA in inducing
apoptosis (Fig. 1B). The comparative levels of apoptotic
cells after treatment with DHA or X-11 at different
concentrations were confirmed by measuring fragmented
DNA (hypodiploid DNA) using FACS (Fig. 1C). While
about 57% of HL-60 cells underwent apoptosis after

treatment with 0.2 μM X-11 for 24 h, a 4-fold higher
concentration of DHA was required to induce the same
amount of apoptotic cells (Fig. 1C).
To determine the mechanism of apoptosis induction
by DHA and X-11 treatment, the levels of apoptosisrelated proteins were investigated in HL-60 cells treated
with these two compounds. Altered levels of cleaved
PARP in cells treated with DHA and X-11 corresponded
to levels of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9,
suggesting that all three caspases participated in apoptosis
induction (Fig. 1D). Although, there was a report showing
that caspase-8 was activated in HL-60 cells after DHA
treatment, the activation of caspase-9 was not determined
[15]. In a separated report it was found that a sub-clone
of Jurkat cells defective in caspase-8 expression was
responsive to DHA-induced apoptosis [18]. We compared
the apoptosis induction ability of DHA and X-11 in Jurkat
sub-clones, I 9.2 cells with defective caspase-8 and A3
cells expressing caspase-8. Both cell lines were equally

sensitive to DHA- and X-11-induced apoptosis (Supp
Fig. 1A); in both lines apoptosis was associated with the
activation of caspase-9 (Supp Fig. 1B), indicating that a
mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway plays a more
important role than death receptor-mediated pathway. Of
note is the fact that much higher concentrations of DHA
and X-11 were needed to induce apoptosis in both I 9.2
and A3 cell lines as compared to that used in HL-60
cells (Supp Fig. 1, Fig. 1). The mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway leading to caspase-9 activation is controlled by
anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, as well as the BH3-only
proteins Bad, Bim, PUMA and Noxa [19, 20]. The levels
of those proteins were measured in HL-60 cells treated
with DHA and X-11. Previously we reported that HL60 cells did not express Bcl-xL and that decreasing the
Mcl-1 protein level could induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells
[21, 22]. Neither Mcl-1 level, nor Bcl-2, Bax or Bak were
changed after treatment with DHA and X-11 (Fig. 1D).

MitoSOXTM Red followed by FACS analysis. The peak shift to the right indicates increase in the levels of O2- content (A). The effects of
DPI on DHA and X-11-induced apoptosis were determined by PI staining followed by FACS analysis (B). Cleavage of PARP, caspase-3,

HL-60 cells express high levels of Bad, Bim and PUMA,
but lower levels of Noxa. The levels of Bad and PUMA
were decreased after treatment with DHA and X-11. Noxa,
BimL and BimS, but not BimEL, were induced by treatment
with DHA and X-11 in HL-60 cells. Since Noxa, BimL
and BimS were also induced in Jurkat A3 and I 9.2 subclones treated with higher concentrations of DHA and
X-11 (Supp Fig. 1B), these data suggest that Noxa and/or
Bim-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway accounts
for DHA and X-11-induced apoptosis.

levels of ROS in HL-60 cells treated with DHA and X-11
were measured using a H2O2-sensitive fluorescent probe
DCFH-DA. DHA and X-11 treatment for 6, 9 and 15 h
increased the amount of H2O2 (Supp Fig. 2A). Although
pretreatment with either N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or
catalase (CAT) decreased H2O2 accumulation caused by
DHA and X-11 treatment (Supp Fig. 2B), neither NAC nor
CAT blocked DHA and X-11-induced apoptosis (Supp Fig.
2C). Pretreatment with NAC and CAT altered only very
minimally the activation of caspase-3 and -9 as well as the
up-regulation of Noxa and Bim (Supp Fig. 2D). Therefore,
these data are consistent with the previous report showing
that DHA-induced apoptosis could not be blocked by
NAC in HL-60 cells [15].
To find out if O2- has a role in DHA/X-11-induced
apoptosis, O2--sensitive fluorogenic dye MitoSOXTM
Red was used to measure O2- levels. Treatment with 0.2
μM X-11 and 0.8 μM DHA increased the levels of O2(Fig. 2A). Diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), an O2-

Superoxide (O2-), but not H2O2, plays an important
role in DHA and X-11-induced apoptosis in HL-60
cells
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been reported
to be involved in DHA-induced apoptosis in Jurkat and
melanoma cells [18, 23], but not in HL-60 cells [15]. The

inhibitor [24], attenuated the DHA and X-11 treatmentincreased O2- levels of HL-60 (Fig. 2A). Correlated with
the inhibition of O2- accumulation, DHA and X-11-induced
DNA fragmentation was attenuated by DPI (Fig. 2B). DPI
also inhibited the cleavage of PARP, caspase-3 and -9, as
well as the up-regulation of Noxa and BimL induced by
DHA and X-11 treatment (Fig. 2C). These data suggest
that O2-, but not H2O2, plays an important role in apoptosis
induction and Noxa up-regulation of HL-60 cells treated
with DHA and X-11.

Pretreatment with DFO significantly suppressed DHA/X11-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3A). Addition of 100 µM DFO
decreased 0.8 µM DHA-induced apoptosis from 42.7% to
11.9% and 0.2 µM X-11-induced apoptosis from 58.2 to
22.7%. DFO blocked DHA and X-11-induced cleavage
of PARP, caspase-3 and caspase-9, as well as the upregulation of Noxa and Bim (Fig. 3B). Although addition
of 100 µM Fe2+ or Fe3+ reversed the blockage of DFO on
DHA/X-11-induced apoptosis, exogenous Fe2+/Fe3+ only
minimally enhanced DHA/X-11-induced apoptosis (Data
not shown). These data suggest that the intracellular iron
content of HL-60 cells is sufficient to activate DHA and
X-11. Since DFO also attenuated DHA and X-11-induced
O2- production (Fig. 3C), it seems that iron plays an
essential role in apoptosis induction by DHA and X-11 in
leukemia cells.

Iron is required for DHA/X-11-induced apoptosis
in HL-60 cells
Several reports show that iron plays an important
role in DHA-induced cell death [15, 25, 26]. To test the
role of iron in the apoptosis induction by DHA and X-11,
iron chelator, deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) was used.

At low concentrations of DHA and of X-11
endoperoxide bridge is required for apoptosis
induction in leukemia cells

as DHA and X-11 to induce BimL and BimS regardless
of the concentrations used. These data suggest that the
endoperoxide bridge of DHA and X-11 is the functional
moiety for the induction of apoptosis and Noxa protein at
lower concentrations.

The endoperoxide bridge of DHA interacts with iron
to form carbon-centered radicals which cause cytotoxicity
[16]. To test the requirement of the endoperoxide bridge
in the apoptosis induction in cells treated with DHA
and X-11, deoxygenated counterparts of DHA and X-11
(DODHA and DOX-11) were synthesized (Sup Fig. 3).
In both compounds the endoperoxide bridge moiety
contained only one oxygen (Fig. 4A). Unlike DHA and
X-11, DODHA at 0.8 µM and DOX-11 at 0.2 µM neither
increased the O2- levels (Fig. 4B) nor induced apoptosis
(Fig. 4C), at 80 μM concentration of DODHA and 8 μM
of DOX-11 both compounds increased the levels of Noxa
(Fig. 4D). DODHA and DOX-11 have similar abilities

Noxa is a key mediator of DHA- and X-11-induced
apoptosis in leukemia cells which is induced
through a FOXO3a-mediated pathway
The up-regulation of Noxa and Bim is associated
with apoptosis induction in HL-60 cells in response to
DHA and X-11 (Fig. 1D). Additional AML cell lines
(NB4 and U937) were used to test apoptosis induction and
Noxa/Bim up-regulation by DHA/X-11 treatment. While
NB4 cells were as sensitive as HL-60 cells to DHA/X-11
treatment (Fig. 5A), U937 cells were less sensitive. Four-

levels were determined using Western blot analysis (B). HL60/M15 and HL60/V3 cells were treated with X-11 at 0.1 µM for 24 h and their
extracts were used to measure the protein levels of Noxa and Mcl-1 with Western blotting (C) and the intact cells for percent of apoptosis

fold higher concentrations of either DHA (3.2 μM) or
X-11 (0.8 μM) were required to induce apoptosis in U937
cells (Fig. 5A). The up-regulation of Noxa, but not Bim,
was associated with the cleavage of PARP, caspase-3 and
caspase-9 in both NB4 and U937 cell lines (Fig. 5B). Noxa
is a pro-apoptotic protein that inactivates Mcl-1, but not
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and leads to apoptosis [27]. To test the
role of Mcl-1 in Noxa induction-mediated apoptosis, HL60/M15, HL-60 cells transfected with a Mcl-1 expression
vector, and HL-60/V3, HL-60 cells transfected with
an empty vector, were used to compare their responses
to X-11-induced apoptosis. HL60/M15 cells contain
higher levels of Mcl-1 than HL-60/V3 cells (Fig. 5C).
Both sub-clones were treated with X-11 at 0.1 µM for
24 h. Although Noxa was induced to the same level by
X-11 treatment in both sub-clones (Fig. 5C), apoptosis
induction ability of X-11 was reduced in HL-60/M5 cells

as determined by PARP cleavage (Fig. 5C) and staining
with annexin V (Fig. 5D).
NB4 and HL-60 cell lines are equally responsive to
apoptosis induction and Noxa up-regulation by DHA/X-11
treatment. Noxa was silenced in NB4 cells. Silencing of
Noxa blocked X-11-induced PARP cleavage without
influencing the Mcl-1 level (Fig. 6A) and apoptosis (Supp
Fig. 4). Noxa leads to Bak activation by competitive
binding to Mcl-1 [28]. To test the role of Bak in the
apoptosis induction by X-11 treatment, Bak was also
silenced in NB4 cells. Similar to the silencing of Noxa,
knocking down of Bak blocked X-11-induced PARP
cleavage (Fig. 6B) and apoptosis (Supp Fig. 4). These
data suggest that induction of Noxa plays an important
role in the apoptosis induction. To test the signaling
pathways through which Noxa is induced, the mRNA
levels of NOXA were measured. X-11 treatment increased

(C) and the protein levels were measured by Western blot analysis (D). E, NB4 cells were transfected with FOXO3A siRNA or a negative
control siRNA, and after 18 h, treated with 0.2 μM X-11 for 18 h. The protein levels of PARP, Noxa and GAPDH were determined. F, DPI,
but not NAC, inhibited X-11-induced Noxa and FOXO3a. NB4 cells were pretreated with or without 1 μM DPI or 10 mM NAC followed

the mRNA levels in NB4 cells (Fig. 6C), suggesting the
induction of Noxa is at the transcription level. It has
been reported that Noxa can be induced by ROS through
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress- and FOXO3amediated pathways [29-31]. We compared the levels of
CHOP, a member of ER stress signaling, and FOXO3a
protein levels and found that FOXO3a, but not CHOP,
was induced after X-11 treatment (Fig. 6D). Silencing of
FOXO3a blocked X-11-induced PARP cleavage and Noxa
protein (Fig. 6E) as well as apoptosis (Sup Fig. 4). DPI,
but not NAC, blocked X-11-induced apoptosis and Noxa
in HL-60 cells (Fig. 2, Sup Fig. 2). Similarly, we found
that DPI, but not NAC, blocked X-11-induced FOXO3a,
Noxa and PARP cleavage in NB4 cells (Fig. 6F). These
data suggest that FOXO3a is a mediator of O2- and Noxa
induction in AML cells treated with X-11.

U937 cells express high levels of Bcl-xL (Fig.
5B) [32]. Since Bcl-xL also inhibits Bak, an effect not
antagonized by Noxa [33], the lesser sensitivity of U937
cells to DHA and X-11 treatment is probably due to
their expression of Bcl-xL. ABT-737 is a small molecule
inhibitor of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL proteins and induces apoptosis
in AML cells [34]. The combined effect of DHA with
ABT-737 was tested by treating U937 cells with different
concentrations of DHA alone, and in combination with
ABT-737 at different ratios, and apoptosis induction
rates were determined by morphological observation
after staining with AO/EB (Fig. 7A). Using Compusyn

morphologic changes by microscopic detection of AO/EB-stained cells (A). The nature of interaction between ABT-737 and DHA was
characterized by median dose effect analysis using CompuSyn software. CI values of less than 1.0 (horizontal line) correspond to a
synergistic interaction. Fa on the x- axis denotes the fraction affected (B). U937 cells were treated with 0.5 μM ABT-737, 0.8 μM DHA and

indicated proteins were determined by Western blotting using specific antibodies (D).

software, the combined apoptotic effects of DHA with
ABT-737 were analyzed for synergy. CI values were
calculated for different dose-effect levels based on
parameters derived from median-effect plots of DHA
alone, ABT-737 alone, or their combinations. As shown
in Fig. 7B, simultaneous exposure of U937 cells to ABT737 (0.125-2 μM) and DHA (0.2-2.4 μM) showed CIs of
less than 1, indicating synergistic effects. The synergistic
apoptotic effect was confirmed in U937 cells using FACS
analysis of annexin V stained cells after treatment with 0.5
µM ABT-737 and 0.8 µM DHA. While individually, each
of the compounds produced only <11% apoptotic cells, the
combined treatment increased apoptosis to approximately
44% (Fig. 7C). DHA at 0.8 µM induced Noxa, but not
PARP cleavage. Addition of ABT-737 enhanced cleavage
of PARP and caspase-3 as well as Noxa level (Fig. 7D).

Similar data were observed for U937 cells treated with
ABT-737 (0.125-2 μM) in combination with X-11 (0.050.6 μM), in which synergistic apoptotic effects were
obtained with CIs less than 1 were detected (Fig. 8A, 8B).
The combined treatment of 0.5 µM ABT-737 with 0.2 µM
X-11 induced approximately 38% apoptotic cells while
individually, each compound produced only <17% (Fig.
8C). X-11 was more potent than DHA in Noxa induction
which was not further enhanced by ABT-737 (Fig. 8D).
These data suggest that the inhibition of Bcl-xL and/
or Bcl-2 by ABT-737 together with Noxa induction by
DHA/X-11 account for their synergistic apoptotic effect.
Increased levels of Bcl-2 were shown to be
associated with resistance and relapse in anti-AML
therapy [35, 36]. To test if the increased levels of Bcl-2
in HL-60 cells correspond to decreased response to DHA

and X-11, clones of HL-60 transfected with either Bcl2 (HL-60/Bcl2) or an empty vector (HL-60/neo) were
tested. While HL-60/neo cells were as sensitive as the
parental HL-60 cells HL-60/Bcl2 cells were less sensitive
to DHA/X-11-induced apoptosis. While DHA at 0.8 μM
and X-11 at 0.2 μM induced approximately 60% of HL60/neo cells to undergo apoptosis, even at the higher
concentrations, (DHA at 3.2 μM and X-11 at 0.4 μM),
the compound induced apoptosis in only less than 10% of
HL-60/Bcl2 cells (Fig. 9A), indicating that overexpression
of Bcl-2 causes resistance to DHA/X-11. ABT-737 at a
concentration of 0.1 μM alone did not induce apoptosis

but enhanced apoptosis of HL-60/Bcl2 cells treated with
3.2 µM DHA or 0.4 µM X-11 (Fig. 9A). DHA at 3.2 µM
and X-11 at 0.4 µM increased the levels of Noxa in both
HL-60/neo and HL-60/Bcl2 cells, but cleavage of PARP
and caspase-3 only occurred in HL-60/neo cells (Fig. 9B).
Addition of ABT-737 together with DHA or X-11 induced
cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 in HL-60/Bcl2 cells (Fig.
9B). These data suggest that increased levels of Bcl-2
decrease cell sensitivity to DHA and X-11 and this can be
overcome by the addition of ABT-737.

DISCUSSION

cells. Moreover, we found that FOXO3a is the mediator
of increased levels of O2- and Noxa protein. FOXO3a is a
transcription factor known to induce expression of several
pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bim, FasL and TRAIL [48].
There is only one report showing that FOXO3a induces
Noxa expression in neuroblastoma cells [31]. We found
that FOXO3a is a novel mediator of Noxa-induction by
X-11 treatment (Fig. 6C, 6D). Silencing of FOXO3a
inhibited X-11-induced up-regulation of Noxa and O2inhibitor DPI blocked X-11 induction of FOXO3a and
Noxa up-regulation (Fig. 6E, 6F). Therefore we observe
a new cascade of O2-/FOXO3a/Noxa in AML cells treated
with X-11 which plays an essential role in apoptosis
induction.
AML cells express Bcl-2 with varied expression of
Bcl-xL [32]. HL-60 and NB4 cells which express high
levels of Bcl-2 without Bcl-xL, are sensitive to DHA and
X-11-induced apoptosis (Figs. 1, 5). Since both cell lines
also express high levels of Bim, which binds to Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2 in
those lines is compromised by the expression of Bim.
Overexpression of Bcl-2 in HL-60 cells decreases their
sensitivity to DHA and X-11-induced apoptosis even
when Noxa is induced (Fig. 9). This might be due to Bcl2 competition for Bim which frees Mcl-1, a process that
would require more Noxa to antagonize the anti-apoptotic
effects of Mcl-1. Therefore, the ratio between Bcl-2 and
Bim could regulate the sensitivity of AML cells to DHA
and X-11-induced apoptosis. Although we found that

We found that DHA and its derivative X-11-induced
apoptosis in AML HL-60 and NB4 cells and that this
effect was associated with Noxa induction (Fig. 1D, 5B).
Overexpression of Mcl-1 (Fig. 5C, 5D) and silencing of
Noxa and Bak attenuated X-11-induced apoptosis (Fig.
6A, 6B), supporting the notion that Noxa up-regulation
leads to Bak activation through inactivation of Mcl-1.
Mcl-1 is a key anti-apoptotic protein that protects mature
neutrophils against cell death [38-39]. The activated MEK/
ERK and AKT/mTOR signaling pathways have been
found to increase Mcl-1 levels in AML cells [40-42] such
that Mcl-1 is being considered as a therapeutic target for
AML therapy [42]. Although many agents can decrease
the levels of Mcl-1 protein, only limited efficacies were
observed in AML patients [42]. It is possible that agents
inhibiting Mcl-1 activity through other pathways will
be more effective and need to be developed. Noxa, a
BH3-only protein, specifically binds to Mcl-1 and then
leads to Bak activation and apoptosis [9]. Based on the
specificity of Noxa binding to Mcl-1, Noxa mimetics are
being developed [43]. Several agents approved for cancer
therapy such as bortezomib have been found to induce
Noxa expression [44].
Although it has been reported that DHA induces
Noxa and/or activates Bak in melanoma and lung
adenocarcinoma cells, much higher concentrations of
DHA were used [23, 45]. Since in AML cells DHA is
capable of inducing Noxa expression at 100-fold lower
concentrations than those used in solid tumors, it suggests
that DHA induces Noxa in AML cells through different
mechanisms. We found that several factors mediate the
Noxa induction in AML cells. First, we determined that
the endoperoxide moiety of DHA and X-11, as well as
the intracellular iron, were required for Noxa induction
in AML cells (Figs. 3, 4). The connection of iron with the
endoperoxide moiety may come from their interaction
to form carbon-center radical which mediates apoptosis
induction in AML cells [16]. Second, we found that O2-,
but not H2O2, mediates Noxa induction in AML cells. The
role of ROS in DHA-induced apoptosis is controversial
[15, 18, 23]. It has been found that Noxa induction in
melanoma and Jurkat cells treated with high concentrations
of DHA was inhibited by antioxidant NAC [18, 23]. We
found that the antioxidant NAC and catalase did not block
DHA and X-11-induced apoptosis or Noxa induction (Sup
Fig. 2), which is consistent with a previous report showing
that DHA-induced apoptosis was not blocked by NAC in
HL-60 cells [15]. However, we did find that increase of
the O2- levels after DHA and X-11 treatment contributes
to apoptosis and Noxa induction, and is blocked by an
O2- inhibitor DPI (Fig. 2). It seems that DHA and X-11
form more active products with iron and, by targeting
mitochondrial function, produce more O2- [46, 47]. This,
in turn, leads to Noxa and apoptosis induction in AML
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Figure 10: A working model of DHA and X-11 apoptosis
induction in AML cells. DHA or X-11 interacts with iron

to produce ROS (O2-) through the endoperoxide moiety, which
strongly upregulates Noxa and weakly upregulates Bim. The
induced Noxa protein binds to Mcl-1 and then leads to Bak
activation. The anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2 is antagonized by
basal and induced levels of Bim. ABT-737 combined with DHA
synergistically induces apoptosis in AML cells due to respective
inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and Mcl-1.

DHA and X-11 weakly induce the Bim isoforms, BimL
and BimS, in HL-60 cells (Fig. 1D), the levels of BimL and
BimS were not induced in NB4 cells treated with DHA
and X-11 (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that the basal, not
the induced levels of Bim, are sufficient to antagonize the
Bcl-2 and to participate in DHA/X-11-induced apoptosis.
Some AML cells, such as U937, express all three antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. Bcl-xL also
binds to Bak and protects cells from apoptosis in a way
similar to that of Mcl-1 [42]. Since Noxa does not bind to
Bcl-xL, Bcl-xL needs to be inhibited in AML cells treated
with DHA/X-11. ABT-737 is a newly developed Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL inhibitor [49]. The apoptosis induction ability
of ABT-737 is attenuated by increased levels of Mcl-1
[34]. ABT-737 acts synergistically with DHA and X-11
to induce apoptosis in U937 cells (Fig. 7, 8). Our data
provide a strong rationale for the combined use of DHA
with ABT-737 for AML patient treatment with the goal of
inhibiting both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL/Bcl-2.
Overall, we found that by inducing Noxa,
inactivating Mcl-1 and causing Bak activation, DHA and
X-11 are potent apoptosis inducers in AML cells. The
weakly induced and/or basally expressed Bim participates
in the apoptosis induction by inhibiting Bcl-2. DHA/X-11
in combination with ABT-737 synergistically induce
apoptosis in AML cells that express high levels of BclxL and/or Bcl-2. Intracellular iron and the endoperoxide
moiety of DHA and X-11 are required for apoptosis and
Noxa induction through a ROS-mediated pathway (Fig.
10). Since normal myeloid cells contain much lower levels
of iron and are much less sensitive to DHA-induced cell
death [46], DHA and X-11 could be developed as selective
apoptosis inducers in AML cells alone or in combination
with ABT-737.

Cell lines
Human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells, human
acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells, and human acute
monocytic leukemia U937 cells, were cultured in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 100 units/mL penicillin,
100 μg/mL streptomycin and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS) [50]. Jurkat cell (sub-clone A3)
and its caspase-8 deficient sub-clone, I 9.2 (obtained from
ATCC, Rockville, MD), were cultured in RPMI 1640
medium modified to contain 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10
mmol/L HEPES, 1.0 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/L
glucose, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 100 U/mL penicillin,
100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 10% FBS [51]. HL-60/neo
and HL-60/Bcl2 cells are clones of human HL-60 cells
transfected with an empty vector and a Bcl-2-expression
plasmid (obtained from Dr. Cleary) [52]. HL-60/V3
and HL-60/M15 cells are clones of human HL-60 cells
transfected with an empty vector and a Mcl-l-expression
plasmid generated by us previously [53].

Quantitation of apoptotic cells
Apoptotic cells were determined by morphologic
observation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis after staining with PI or Annexin V [53].
For morphologic apoptosis quantification, cells were
stained with AO and EB as described previously [50], and
the percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated from 300
cells. For FACS analysis with PI staining, cells were fixed
with ice-cold 70% ethanol at a density of 1×105 cells/mL
and treated with 1 mg/mL RNase for 30 min at 37 ºC.
PI was then added to a final concentration of 50 μg/mL
and the DNA content was quantitated by flow cytometry
(Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) with an excitation
wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of
625 nm. Data were analyzed using CELLQuest (Becton
Dickinson) software. For FACS analysis with Annexin V
staining, Annexin V–FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit and
Annexin V–PI Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences)
were used to quantify apoptosis by FACS analysis.

ml) were first mixed with 0.5 μmol/L DCFH-DA for 1 h
and then incubated with or without DHA and X-11 for
various time periods at 37ºC. After washing with PBS,
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with excitation and
emission wavelengths of 495 nm and 525 nm, respectively
[50].

RNA isolation was performed using the RNA
isolation kit (Gentra). cDNA was prepared using
an oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript II Reverse
Tanscriptase (Invitrogen) following standard protocols.
Primers used in these experiments were as follows:
NOXA, 5’-AGAAGGCGCGCAAGAACGCT-3’ and
5’-TTTCTCCCCAGCCGCCCAGT-3’; and β-actin, 5’ATCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG-3’
and 5’-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATC
TGC-3’. After reverse transcription, the cDNA product
was amplified by PCR with two units of Taq DNA

annealing temperature of 55ºC.

Measurement of intracellular superoxide anion
(O2-) content
Levels of intracellular O2- content were measured
by mitochondrial superoxide indicator MitoSOX™
Red, which rapidly enters live cells and is oxidized by
superoxide, but not by other ROS- or reactive nitrogen
species (RNS)–generating systems, and exhibits red
fluorescence. Briefly, cells (1 × 105 cells/ml) treated or
untreated with DHA/X-11 for various time periods, were
incubated with 5 μmol/L MitoSOX™ Red for 15 min at
37ºC, protected from light. After washing with phosphate
buffer saline (PBS), cells were analyzed by flow cytometry
with excitation and emission wavelength of 510 and 580
nm, respectively.
