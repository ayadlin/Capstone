ABSTRACT
It was recently suggested that daily dose, liver metabolism and lipophilicity were
associated with an oral drug’s potential to cause hepatotoxicity, but this has not been
widely accepted. A likely reason is that published data lack comprehensiveness, as
they were based on only about one third of all FDA approved single-active-ingredient
oral prescription drugs. Here the 975 oral drugs used worldwide which have a
Defined Daily Dose (DDD) designated in the World Health Organization’s Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical classification system and whose hADRs potential and metabolism
data are available in the Micromedex Drugdex® compendium were studied, with their
lipophilicity calculated by the partition coefficient LogP. Of the 975 drugs examined,
49% (478) have the potential to induce at least one type of hepatic adverse drug
reactions (hADRs) such as fatal hepatotoxicity, acute liver failure, significant ALT/AST
elevation, hepatitis, and jaundice. By single factor analysis, a higher DDD (≥100 mg)
was found to be associated with all types of hADRs, and extensive liver metabolism
(≥50%) was associated with a subset of hADRs including fatal hADRs, hepatitis and
jaundice, while LogP showed no relation to any types of hADRs. Contrary to previous
reports, none of the combination, neither DDD and liver metabolism, nor DDD and
LogP, was found to be more predictive of hADRs than using DDD or liver metabolism
alone. These data provide convincing evidence that a higher daily dose and extensive
liver metabolism, but not lipophilicity, are independent but not synergistic risk factors
for oral drugs to induce hepatotoxicity.

that a higher dose (that is, ≥50 mg) is a risk factor for
severe hADRs induced by oral medications [4]. Using a
slightly smaller number of 207 drugs, the same group later
on reported that extensive liver metabolism (that is, ≥50%
liver metabolism) is another risk factor for an oral drug
to induce hADRs, and the combination of daily dose and
liver metabolism appears to be synergistic in predicting
liver risks [5]. More recently, based on data from 164
drugs, another group reported that the combination of oral
dose and lipophilicity was remarkably more effective than
either alone in predicting a drug’s hADR potential  [6].
However, this combination appeared ineffective in a larger

INTRODUCTION
Drug hepatotoxicity is the leading cause of acute
liver failure and unfavorable regulatory actions such as
drug non-approvals or market withdrawals. Tremendous
efforts have been undertaken to predict which drug is
more likely than the others to induce hepatic adverse drug
reactions (hADRs), but relatively little progress has been
made [1]. Inspired by the observation that drugs received
unfavorable regulatory actions due to liver injury are very
often administrated at high doses [2, 3], a recent study
examined 230 mostly prescribed U.S. drugs and concluded

number of 254 drugs [7]. The general belief remains that
none of these medication characteristics are able to predict
hADRs with high confidence [1]. An outstanding caveat
is that all previous studies lack comprehensiveness, that
is, the number of drugs examined is relatively small as
compared to all FDA approved new molecular entities
(NMEs) or currently used oral prescription drugs.
According to a recent report, the FDA has
approved 1,453 new molecular entities from the year
1827 to 2013 [8]. However, this is an underestimate
by about 10%. According to the FDA official statistics,
1,527 NMEs were approved by the FDA during
the period of 1940 to 2011 (http://www.fda.gov/
AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/
SummaryofNDAApprovalsReceipts1938tothepresent/
default.htm). In the year 2012 to 2014, the FDA has
approved an additional 107 NMEs (http://www.fda.gov/
Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DrugInnovation/
default.htm). Therefore at least a total of 1,634 NMEs
has been approved by the FDA. Though some approved
drugs were later on discontinued or withdrawn from
the market [9, 10], the number of currently used singleactive-ingredient oral prescription drugs, as downloaded
in June 2014 from the FDA Online Label Repository
using the FDALabel database [11], is 736. This raised
the possibility that previous reports on dose, metabolism
and lipophilicity affecting hADRs could be biased, as
only a small fraction of drugs, that is, only around 15%
of all the FDA approved NMEs or 34% of all currently
used U.S. oral prescription drugs, were included for
analysis. The present study aimed at to scrutinize the role
of dose, metabolism and lipophilicity, each alone or in
combination, in predicting an oral drug’s hADR potential
using a comprehensive list of drugs covering nearly all
human oral medications.

As of July 2013, the WHO ATC/DDD system
contains 5,015 drug records (Supplementary Table 1),
with 2,338 drugs having DDDs assigned (Supplementary
Table 2), among which 1,013 drugs are used only by oral
administration and 379 drugs are used both orally and
non-orally (Supplementary Table 3). Of the 1,392 drugs
that can be used by oral route, 975 drugs (Supplementary
Table 4) were found to be included in the Micromedex
Drugdex® compendium and therefore were chosen for
further analysis.
Of the 975 drugs analyzed, 478 (49%) drugs were
found to be associated with at least one type of hADRs.
Specifically, 150, 208, 37, 309, 251, 61, and 291 drugs
were shown to have the potential to induce fatal hADRs,
liver failure, liver transplantation, jaundice, biomarker
increase, hepatomegaly and hepatitis, respectively
(Supplementary Table 4). Interestingly, though a previous
report using 230 mostly prescribed U.S. drugs found no
drugs causing liver transplantation when their daily doses
were equal or less than 10 mg [4], here we found that
ramipril with a DDD of 2.5 mg is associated with liver
transplantation.
The Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to
examine if DDDs or LogP are associated with a drug’s
hADR potential. Table 1 shows that the percentage of
drugs inducing all major types of hADRs was significantly
increased when DDDs became higher. Specifically, among
the 169 drugs whose DDDs are less than 10 mg, only
12 drugs (7%) can cause fatal hADRs. However, among
the 288 drugs whose DDDs are in the range of 10 to
100 mg, 35 drugs (12%) can induce fatal hADRs. As for
the 518 drugs whose DDDs are equal or large than 100 mg,
103 drugs (20%) can trigger fatal hADRs. The difference

that the combination of DDD and LogP produced a
negligible increase of the crude odds ratio at the expense
of sacrificing the TPR significantly. Similarly, the
combination of DDD and liver metabolism produced
even worse prediction power, as the crude odds ratio was
actually decreased for several types of hADRs such as
liver failure and liver transplantation, and again the TPR
was markedly reduced for all types of hADRs, with the
majority of them decreased to less than 50%. Table 4
clearly demonstrates that none of the combination, neither
was it DDD and metabolism, nor DDD and LogP, provided
added value in predicting a drug’s hADR potential than
using DDD alone.
The comparison between using liver metabolism
alone and its combination with LogP or DDD, as well
as those using LogP alone and its combination with liver
metabolism or DDD, also showed a similar tendency, that
is, no added value was obtained when combining two
factors, as compared to using either alone. Detailed results
were presented in the Supplementary Table 5.
To further clarify the possible interactions among
DDD, liver metabolism and LogP, the multivariate
logistic regression analysis was performed. As shown in
Table 5, no statistically significant interactions between
DDD and LogP, or DDD and metabolism, were observed
in predicting all the hADRs types examined (p > 0.01).
Similar results were obtained in analyzing the possible
interaction between LogP and metabolism (data not
shown). These results demonstrate that DDD, live
metabolism, and LogP do not interact with each other in
predicting a drug’s hADR potential.
As previous reports used either 50 mg [4] or
100 mg [6] as a cutoff for daily dose, additional analysis
was performed using 50 mg as a cutoff to facilitate a
more direct comparison between our dataset and those
published. Nearly identical results were obtained in these
additional analyses (data not shown).

among dose groups was statistically significant (p < 0.001).
Similar results were obtained regarding other types of
hADRs including liver failure, liver transplantation,
jaundice, biomarker increase, hepatomegaly, and hepatitis,
either individually or combined together. In contrast,
Table 2 shows the percentage of drugs inducing different
types of hADRs (except for jaundice) was not associated
with LogP (p > 0.05).
The Fisher’s exact test was used to determine
if extensive liver metabolism, that is, ≥50% of liver
metabolism as defined in a previous report [5], is
associated with a drug’s hADR potential. As shown
in Table 3, among the 483 drugs that are subjected to
extensive liver metabolism, 99 drugs (20%) can cause
fatal hADRs, while only 18 out of 162 (11%) drugs that
do not undergo extensive liver metabolism can induce
fatal hADRs. Such difference was statistically significant
(p < 0.01). Similarly, extensive liver metabolism was also
associated with jaundice, but not the remaining individual
types of hADRs. Nevertheless, the pooled hADRs were
indeed significantly associated with extensive liver
metabolism (p < 0.01). In contrast to the data in Table 1,
none of the statistically significant association reached the
confidence level of p < 0.001 in Table 3.
We next examined if the combination of DDD,
metabolism or LogP would enhance the prediction
power as previously suggested [5, 6]. The overall
results comparing the performance of DDD alone to
its combination with either LogP or metabolism were
presented in Table 4. For all the individual types of
hADRs except hepatomegaly, the combination of DDD
and LogP produced a slightly higher crude odds ratio
than using DDD alone. However, none of such increase
exceeded 43% of the odds ratio associated with DDD
alone, and these slight increases were accompanied by
a sharp decrease in the true positive rate (TPR), with
all of which becoming less than 50%. It is apparent

DISCUSSION

associated with only some but not all types of hADRs,
indicating that liver metabolism is a less important risk
factor than daily dose for predicting an oral drug’s hADR
potential. Further supporting this notion, a recent report [7]
based on 254 drugs showed that higher daily doses were
more effective than cytochrome P450s (CYP) mediated
metabolism in predicting a drug’s hADRs potential.
Contrary to the common assumption [12] and a
recent report [5], though DDD and liver metabolism
each alone contributes to a drug’s hADR potential, their
combination does not have a synergistic effect. This is
likely because that the qualitative but not quantitative
nature of liver metabolism plays a more important role
in triggering hADRs. Regardless of the reasons, our data
clearly show that a previous report about the enhanced
power of the combination of daily dose and liver
metabolism in predicting hADRs [5] needs to be revisited.
Of note, our data are in line with a more recent report
which showed that, among 254 oral drugs, though “drugs
that are cytochrome P450s enzymes substrates” were more
likely to induced hADRs than those that are not substrates,
this tendency is dose-independent [7].
Another interesting finding is that when lipophilicity
was combined with DDD, no added value was obtained.
This is in contrast to a recent report which showed that
a combination of LogP ≥ 3 and DDD ≥ 100 mg was
remarkable more predictive of a drug’s hADR potential
than using either criterion alone [6], but is consistent with
a more recent publication that was based on a slightly large
number of drugs [7]. It seems apparent that lipophilicity,
either alone or in combination with other factors, does
not play a significant role in predicting an oral drug’s
liver risks.
Our study provides a unique quantitative estimate of
the hADR risks in overall human medication use, that is,
49% of the drugs examined have the potential to induce

This is the most comprehensive study so far
that aimed at examining the relation between a drug’s
hADR potential and its daily dose, liver metabolism, or
lipophilicity. Our results not only consolidated and but also
remarkably expanded the view that a higher daily dose is
a risk factor for oral drugs to induce hADRs. Though a
previous report based on 230 drugs failed to demonstrate
a statistically significant association between daily dose
and ALT > 3 × ULN, nor daily dose and jaundice [4], here
these associations became clearly established by using a
more than 4-fold larger number of drugs. Additionally,
daily dose was found to be strongly associated with
hepatitis and hepatomegaly, two types of hADRs that were
not examined in the previous study [4]. This finding is of
particular significance because nearly one third (291 out of
975) of drugs were found to be associated with hepatitis.
Our data provide convincing evidence that a higher daily
dose is a risk factor for all major types of hADRs induced
by oral medications.
In partial agreement with a previous study [5], we
found that only a subset of hADRs was associated with
extensive liver metabolism. It is notable that both our
study and the previous report [5] showed that fatal DILI
and ALT > 3 × ULN, but not liver transplantation, were
related to extensive liver metabolism. A notable difference
between two studies is that jaundice, but not liver failure,
was shown to be related to extensive liver metabolism in
our dataset, but the opposite was observed in the previous
study [5]. We additionally found that hepatitis was also
significantly associated with extensive liver metabolism.
These consistencies and discrepancies are most likely
due to the number of drugs studied. Regardless of the
differences, both the previous report [5] and our present
study clearly show that extensive liver metabolism was

at least one type of hADRs. This result may help health
care providers, regulators and pharmaceutical industries
better evaluate the risks of hADRs associated with drugs.
Due to the relatively rareness of severe hADRs
and ethical issues, many theories are difficult to be tested
experimentally and are therefore highly speculative at this
time, and controversies are not uncommon in this field
[13]. Given that few general rules have been established
in the past decades, any new rules such as the one dubbed
“rule of 2” [6] shall be treated with caution. Similar
caution and scrutiny should be exercised in viewing the
recently developed new experimental approaches aimed
at predicting hADRs, such as those using high-content
analysis of cellular injury [14], mitochondrial dysfunctions
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[15] and a combination of mechanistic toxicity endpoints
[16], as all these studies were also based upon drugs in the
low hundreds. To minimize further confusions, our study
highlights the importance of avoiding overgeneralization
before comprehensive studies are in place. By the same
token, the present study has two apparent limitations.
First, the drug list does not cover all drugs used by
human kind. Secondly, understandings of a drug’s hADRs
potential, as well as its metabolism, are evolving with time
and the present study represents only a snapshot of current
knowledge deposited in a single database, the Micromedex

MATERIALS AND METHODS

focused on “alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than
3 times the upper limit of normal” (ALT > 3 × ULN)
as one important type of hADRs [4, 5], we used a more
general term, that is, biomarker increase, to cover this type
of hADRs, for which we included not only ALT > 3 ×
ULN, but also other findings such as “clinically significant
increase of ALT and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)”,
or “ALT/AST elevations that led to drug withdrawal”, (2)
we additionally collected drugs that are associated with
hepatitis and/or hepatomegaly, as we noticed that lots
of drugs can cause these types of hADRs, (3) we used
the term “severe hADRs” to cover hADRs leading to
death or causing acute liver failure or necessitating liver
transplantation. Other criteria are the same as previous
reports [4, 5]. As the Micromedex Drugdex® compendium
is updating constantly, and our data collection was
completed in March 2014, updates after that will not be
reflected in the present manuscript.
In line with a previous report, drug lipophilicity was
determined by the partition coefficient LogP [6], which
was calculated using the online software ALOGPS 2.1
(http://www.vcclab.org/lab/alogps/start.html).
Statistical analysis: For single factor analysis, the
Cochran-Armitage test was used to determine the statistical
significance of the association between DDDs and hADRs,
and the Fisher’s exact test was used for liver metabolism
and hADRs. The possible interaction between DDD and
LogP or liver metabolism, or LogP and liver metabolism,
was determined by multivariate logistic regression model
using the Wald test. A p value less than 0.05, 0.01 or 0.001
was considered as statistically meaningful.

All drug records in the World Health Organization’s
(WHO) Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification
and Defined Daily Dose (ATC/DDD) system were
manually collected from the official website at http://www.
whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/ in July 2013.
Only drugs with an assigned DDD were selected
for further analysis. Though previous reports [4, 6, 7]
used other sources than the WHO ATC/DDD system to
determine a drug’s daily dose, we chose not to do so.
This not only minimizes subjectivity but also reduces
possible errors, as the WHO ATC/DDD system represents
the consensus achieved among worldwide experts and
has been considered as a reliable information source for
nearly 30 years. Notably, the WHO ATC/DDD system
also updates the DDDs when the dosage changes over
time (http://www.whocc.no/filearchive/publications/2014_
guidelines.pdf).
If a drug is used by both oral and non-oral routes of
administration, it was also included in the present study,
but only the oral DDD was used for analysis. For a small
number of oral drugs that are used for multiple diseases
and therefore have multiple DDDs, the average DDDs
were used.
In line with previous reports [4, 5], the Micromedex
Drugdex® compendium was used to collect the drug
metabolism data and to determine if a drug causes any
types of hADRs. For data collection, the criteria used in
previous reports [4, 5] were used with slight modifications.
These modifications include (1) though previous reports
