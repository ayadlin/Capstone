ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma recurrence involves the persistence of a subpopulation of cells with
enhanced tumor-initiating capacity (TIC) that reside within the perivascular space,
or niche (PVN). Anti-angiogenic therapies may prevent the formation of new PVN but
have not prevented recurrence in clinical trials, suggesting they cannot abrogate TIC
activity. We hypothesized that combining anti-angiogenic therapy with blockade of
PVN function would have superior anti-tumor activity. We tested this hypothesis in an
established intracranial xenograft model of GBM using a monoclonal antibody specific
for murine and human VEGF (mcr84) and a Protein Epitope Mimetic (PEM) CXCR4
antagonist, POL5551. When doses of POL5551 were increased to overcome an mcr84induced improvement in vascular barrier function, combinatorial therapy significantly
inhibited intracranial tumor growth and improved survival. Anti-tumor activity was
associated with significant changes in tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis, and a
reduction in the numbers of perivascular cells expressing the TIC marker nestin. A
direct effect on TICs was demonstrated for POL5551, but not mcr84, in three primary
patient-derived GBM isolates. These findings indicate that targeting the structure and
function of the PVN has superior anti-tumor effect and provide a strong rationale for
clinical evaluation of POL5551 and Avastin in patients with GBM.

INTRODUCTION

and as an adjunct to chemotherapy [23-25]. In the central
nervous system, the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis is critical for
the function of the primary neurogenic subependymal zone
as well as secondary germinal matrices in the cerebellum
and hippocampus [26-28]. Disruption of this pathway
by gene deletion results in significant abnormalities in
hematopoiesis and brain development [28, 29].
CXCR4 expression is elevated in many brain tumor
types, including GBM, where increased expression is
associated with a worse prognosis [20, 30, 31]. CXCL12
is also upregulated in the brain tumor microvasculature,
and blocking the CXCR4 axis with antagonists AMD3100
and AMD3465 resulted in significant anti-tumor effects in
animal models [19, 20, 30-33]. In these studies both tumor
cell and microvascular CXCR4 were identified as potential
targets. These findings have supported the clinical
evaluation of AMD3100 in the treatment of recurrent
GBM, though efficacy has not been established. Here, we
hypothesized that in GBM, CXCR4 antagonism works
by blocking the TIC supportive effects of the PVN, and
that in combination with VEGF antagonism, would exert
superior anti-tumor effect by inhibiting PVN formation
and function. We therefore performed a preclinical
study of combined VEGF and CXCR4 antagonism in an
intracranial xenograft model of GBM using the Protein
Epitope Mimetic (PEM) CXCR4 antagonist POL5551
[34], together with mcr89, an anti-VEGF antibody with
dual functionality against both murine and human VEGF
[35].

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant
brain tumor in adults and makes up approximately 5% of
brain tumors in children [1]. Despite advances in surgery,
radiation, and chemotherapy, the average survival for a
patient with GBM remains just15 months from the time
of diagnosis [2]. Temozolomide, an alkylating agent, is
the only drug that, in combination with complete resection
and radiation therapy, has been shown to improve overall
survival [2, 3]. Alternate approaches, particularly those
that can target the mechanisms of recurrence, are required.
Current models of GBM biology suggest that
tumor recurrence depends upon the persistence of a
subpopulation of cells with enhanced tumor-initiating
capacity [4]. These so called tumor-initiating cells
(TICs) or “tumor stem cells,” which are distinguished
by their expression of stem cell markers and enhanced
tumorigenicity, are purported to be a reservoir of germinal
activity from which recurrent tumors derive [5, 6]. Similar
to normal stem cell populations, GBM TICs reside within
specialized niches [7, 8]. The perivascular space or niche
(PVN) in GBM is a cellularly heterogeneous domain that
is enriched with GBM TICs [9-12]. Within the PVN,
functional interactions between GBM TICs microvascular
endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes and microglia
regulate TIC activity, mediate resistance to therapy
and provide a conduit for invasion. Thus targeting the
formation and function of the PVN has the potential to
block GBM recurrence and improve cure.
The formation of new PVN depends upon
angiogenesis. GBM is renowned as being among the
most angiogenic cancers, and this property is highly
correlated with expression and secretion of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by tumor cells [13-15].
Blocking VEGF function with Bevacizumab (Avastin®),
a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against
VEGF-A, is approved for use in several cancers, and has
accelerated approval for relapsed/refractory GBM [16,
17]. Bevacizumab treatment frequently results in transient
radiographic improvement and improved quality of life in
patients with GBM [18]. However, despite initial response,
nearly all patients progress, suggesting either resistance in
angiogenic mechanisms or that tumor growth cannot be
controlled by blocking angiogenesis and formation of new
PVN alone[18].
Multiple cell types and signaling pathways mediate
the functions of the PVN. We previously showed that
endothelial cell-derived CXCL12 was required for
localizing GBM cells to the PVN and also induced
their growth [19]. CXCL12 and its receptor, CXCR4,
are important for the functioning of multiple germinal
matrices in a variety of tissues [20-22]. These functions
have been successfully targeted in the clinical application
of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 for the mobilization
of hematopoietic stem cells from their bone marrow niche
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

RESULTS
We previously demonstrated that CXCR4
antagonism could disrupt the effects of endothelial cells
on GBM cells in an in vitro model of the PVN and block
intracranial xenograft growth [19, 32, 33]. Based on these
findings, we were interested in determining whether
there would be an advantage of combination therapy
with a VEGF antagonist. POL5551, a novel CXCR4
antagonist, was shown to produce superior bone marrow
stem cell mobilization in mice compared to an established
CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 [34]. In this same study,
AMD3100 also had greater dose-limiting toxicities.
We hypothesized that the combination of POL5551 and
mcr84 (VEGF inhibitor) would effectively target GBM
PVN structure and function. We tested this hypothesis
in an intracranial xenograft model of GBM using eGFPluciferase-expressing U87 cells. U87 xenografts are
highly angiogenic and prior studies using them have
identified tumor cell and microvascular targets for CXCR4
antagonism [32, 36]. Thus, we used U87 xenografts to
further define the cellular target(s) of CXCR4 inhibition.
Animals bearing intracranial U87 xenografts that
exhibited steady and equal growth over the two-week
post-impantation period were randomly assigned to one
of four different treatment groups: PBS and IgG (Control),

low dose POL5551 (LD-POL5551, 8mg/kg/day) and IgG,
PBS and mcr84 (10mg/kg twice weekly), LD-POL5551
and mcr84 (Figure 1). Mice were treated for a total of four
weeks, and during the treatment period (week 2 to week 6)
mcr84 alone or mcr84 in combination with LD-POL5551,
significantly inhibited intracranial tumor growth to an
equivalent level as measured by weekly BLI (Figure 2A).
Tumor growth persisted after the cessation of treatment
at 6 weeks. While the addition of POL5551 to mcr84 did
not enhance the inhibition of tumor growth, analysis of
survival indicated there was a benefit to the combination.
Median survival was similar between control (18 days),
mice treated with LD-POL5551 alone (17 days) or mice
treated with mcr84 alone (18 days). However, mice treated
with both LD-POL5551 and mcr84 exhibited significantly
longer median survival (32 days) compared to control
mice (p=0.0179) (Figure 2B). These results indicated
possible synergy between the drugs.
To further investigate interactions between
POL5551 and mcr84, we measured compound levels in
blood plasma, tumor–bearing cortex, and contralateral
(non-tumor bearing) cortex. Consistent with an intact
blood brain barrier (BBB) limiting brain permeation of
POL5551, mean concentrations of POL5551 in normal
brain tissue were 13-fold lower than in plasma (not
shown). Compared to contralateral non-tumor bearing
cortex, mean concentrations of POL5551 in the tumor bed

were 1.7-fold higher (Figure 3A), indicating disruption of
normal BBB function. Importantly, treatment with mcr84
lowered the mean concentrations of POL5551 in tumor
tissue and normal cortex by 28% and 42%, respectively.
These findings suggested that, like Avastin®, mcr84
might normalize and improve barrier function within the
tumor vasculature [37, 38]. To determine whether the
barrier effects of mcr84 could be extrapolated to other
molecules, we examined the extravasation of albumin in
tissue sections from control and mcr84 treated animals.
Throughout tumor sections from mice treated with PBS
and IgG control, we found albumin within the perivascular
space (Figure 3B). mcr84 treatment markedly reduced the
amount of albumin observed within the perivascular space
indicating that VEGF antagonism results in improved
BBB function.
Decreased permeation of POL5551 in the setting
of VEGF antagonism might reduce potential therapeutic
efficacy. To test this hypothesis, we increased the
POL5551 dose ten-fold and sought to determine whether
this could overcome the permeation barrier and exert a
superior anti-tumor effect. Four weeks of 80 mg/kg/day
POL5551 (high dose (HD)) alone or in combination with
mcr84 significantly inhibited intracranial xenograft growth
(Figure 4A). Interestingly, upon cessation of therapy at 6
weeks, tumor growth appeared to rebound in the mcr84containing regimens.

Figure 1: Treatment scheme. (A.) Engraftment of intracranial tumors was confirmed by serial BLI over the two week post implantation
period. (B) A subcutaneous osmotic pump delivered either PBS or POL5551 (low dose or high dose) continuously over 28 days. Mice
received either mcr84 or vehicle IgG antibody (10 mg/kg i.p. twice weekly for 4 weeks).

Consistent with the inhibition of tumor growth, there
was a significant increase in median survival from 18 to
27 days in animals treated with the HD-POL5551 alone
compared to control (p=0.024 (Figure 4B). The addition
of mcr84 to HD-POL5551 further increased median
survival to 35 days, which was a significant improvement
compared to mcr84 (18 days) alone (p=0.009) (Figure
4C). The difference in median survival between mcr84
combined with low dose (32 days) and high dose (35
days) POL5551 did not reach statistical significance but
there was an apparent difference in overall survival. In the
groups treated with the mcr84 and POL551 combination,
there were no survivors by day 37 when LD-POL551 was
used, whereas 30% survived beyond this timepoint HD-

POL5551was used.
To determine whether the improved survival
was associated with increased tumor tissue POL5551,
we confirmed compound concentrations by mass
spectrometry. At the higher dose of POL5551, mean
concentrations were increased approximately 3-fold
in tumor and non-tumor bearing (contralateral) cortex
compared to animals receiving LD-POL5551 (Figure 4D).
Importantly, tumor POL5551 concentrations following
HD-POL5551 were not significantly decreased upon
combination with mcr84.
To evaluate the mechanism of HD-POL5551 antitumor effects we performed tissue based analyses to
examine tumor morphology, and tumor cell proliferation

and apoptosis. None of the treatments altered the
characteristic non-infiltrative pattern of U87 growth
(data not shown). As anticipated, treatment with
mcr84 alone or in combination with HD-POL5551
was associated with a decrease in endoglin positivity
(Figure 5) which is indicative of decreased endothelial
cell numbers. Proliferation was measured with Ki67

was determined in a blinded fashion in multiple highpowered fields from three separate subjects from each

with significant decreases in proliferation and increases
in apoptosis compared to vehicle-treated controls as
determined by two-tailed Fisher’s exact test (Table 1).
In addition, treatment with HD-POL5551 alone or in
combination with mcr84 had a widespread effect on
the shape and size of tumor cell nuclei and appeared to
reduce the numbers of nestin-positive perivascular cells
(Figure 6A, asterisks). Nestin is an intermediate filament
expressed by normal neural and brain tumor stem cells
[39, 40]. It typically fills the cytoplasm of positive cells

as seen in brains from PBS and IgG or PBS and mcr84
treated animals. Interestingly, nestin positivity in tumors
treated with HD-POL5551 was reduced to puncta (Figure
6A, arrowheads).
HD-POL5551 overcame the permeation barrier of
VEGF antagonism and was associated with a superior
anti-tumor effect and changes in tumor cell nuclear
shape, proliferation and apoptosis compared to PBS
controls (PBS+IgG and PBS+mcr84) (Table 1, Figure
6). These findings support the literature that states
CXCR4 antagonist targets are not limited to the vascular
endothelium but include tumor cell targets as well [19,
32]. Taken together with other reports describing a role for
CXCR4 in the regulation of neural stem cell function [41,
42] our data showing that POL5551 reduced the numbers
of nestin positive perivascular cells, led us to hypothesize
that POL5551 might have direct effects on tumor stem
cells. To test this, and improve the translational relevance
of these studies, we investigated the direct effects of
POL5551 on three primary GBM isolates.
The stem cell or TIC fraction of primary GBM
isolates was measured as the CD133 positive fraction in
tumorsphere cultures. CD133 positive cells in three low
passage GBM preparations (CDI-2, CDI-5, B18) were
isolated by MACs with antibody directed against CD133.
To measure the effect of POL5551 on the TIC fraction,
cells were treated with TSM with IgG (10 μg/mL) as
vehicle control, POL5551 (1 μg/mL) and IgG, PBS and
mcr84 (10 μg/mL), or POL5551 and mcr84 together. After
treatment, the CD133 fraction was measured again and
normalized to vehicle. mcr84 alone had no effect on the
CD133 positive fraction. In contrast, POL5551 alone or
in combination with mcr84 reduced the CD133 positive

fraction to 70% of control values (Figure 6B). Together,
these data indicate that CXCR4 antagonism reduces the
GBM TIC fraction through direct action, requiring drug
permeation into tumor tissue.

DISCUSSION
Despite decades of research, GBM remains among
the most devastating malignancies. Targeting both the
function and formation of the PVN could be important
for preventing tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. In
this study, we showed that the combination of a CXCR4
antagonist, POL5551, and a VEGF inhibitor, mcr84, can
increase median overall survival in GBM xenografts

and nestin (purple) expression. Nuclei were counterstained

perivascular space (asterisks). In the HD-POL5551 and IgG and

positive cells within the perivascular space. Nestin positivity is

compared to treatment with either drug as monotherapy.
CXCR4 and VEGF are two of the few validated
targets for directed GBM therapy. Bevacizumab, a
humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF-A,
disrupts the formation of tumor growth by inhibiting
angiogenesis; however, it does not improve cure. CXCR4
expression is well known to be increased in many cancers,
including GBM, and is associated with poor prognosis
[43]. We showed that AMD3100 or AMD3465, related
CXCR4 antagonists, inhibit the growth of intracranial
GBM xenograft models by decreased proliferation
and increased apoptosis of tumor cells [32, 33]. The
CXCR4/CXCL12 pathway has also been shown to be
involved in GBM invasiveness [30, 31]. AMD3100 is
currently being evaluated in clinical trial in combination
with bevacizumab for patients with high-grade gliomas
(NCT01339039). In prior studies, sustained AMD3100
treatment had significant side effects, including
unexplained cardiotoxity [44]. By targeting formation and
function of the tumor PVN, we hoped to decrease tumor
growth and invasiveness synergistically and increase
survival. POL5551 is thought to have less toxicity and
has been shown to have superior ability to mobilize bone
marrow stem cells in a mouse xenograft model [34]. The
improved safety and efficacy of POL5551 over other
CXCR4 antagonists makes it an attractive therapeutic
candidate.
POL5551 was first studied in xenografts for the
use of stem cell mobilization at a dose of 8 mg/kg/day,
prompting our initial dose for this experiment. We saw
a significant increase in survival of mice treated with the
combination of LD-POL5551 and mcr84 compared to
vehicle or either drug alone, suggesting possible synergy.
Measurement of tissue POL5551 concentrations revealed
that in the presence of mcr84, POL5551 concentrations
were decreased in normal brain as well as tumor tissue,
suggesting mcr84 decreased blood vessel permeability and
subsequent permeation of POL5551. VEGF was originally
known as vascular permeability factor (VPF) because of
its influence on the permeability of blood vessels [13].
Our results are consistent with several recent studies
that showed VEGF antagonists, including bevacizumab,
negatively affect concomitant drug penetration into tumor
tissue [45-47].For this reason, we increased the dose
of POL5551 by 10-fold which significantly increased
POL5551 concentrations in plasma, tumor, and normal
brain and significantly increased median survival.
The association of higher POL5551 concentrations
in tumor tissue with increased survival suggests that a
critical target for POL5551 action is within the tumor
parenchyma. This conclusion is supported by the apparent
POL5551-induced decrease of nestin positive stem cells
in vivo, and additionally by the reduction of the CD133
positive cell fraction in three independent primary GBM
isolates by POL5551 in our in vitro studies. Together,
these studies strongly support the clinical evaluation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of combined VEGF and CXCR4 antagonism, but with
increased doses of the CXCR4 antagonist to overcome
the improved vascular barrier function that results from
effective VEGF antagonism.

Animals were used in accordance with an Animal
Studies Protocol (# 20120174) approved by the Animal
Studies Committee of the Washington University School
of Medicine per the recommendations of the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes
of Health).

Human Studies
Primary human GBM specimens for culture were
obtained and utilized in accordance with a Washington
University Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved
Human Studies Protocol (#201102299).

Chemicals and other reagents
POL5551 was supplied by Polyphor and mcr84 was
obtained from Affitech AS and purified in house by Protein
A chromatography. All tissue culture reagents and media
were obtained from Invitrogen unless otherwise indicated.

Tumor cell lines
U87 cells were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and validated by them.
Viral particles were produced by the Viral Vectors Core
Facility of The Hope Center for Neurological Diseases at
Washington University School of Medicine; expression
vectors used in viral production contained a transgene
for green fluorescent protein-firefly luciferase (GFP).
GFP expressing cells were sorted and collected by highspeed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (MoFlo HighPerformance Cell Sorter; DAKO). The eGFP-luciferase

(LIF, Chemicon, 1 x N2 Supplement (Gibco), 1 x B-27
Serum-Free Supplement (Gibco), and heparin (20 ug/mL,
Sigma). Cells were initially plated on tissue-culture coated
plates overnight to allow non-stem-like cells to attach,
and the non-adherent stem-like cells were transferred to
extracellular matrix protein (ECM)-coated tissue culture
plates prepared by coating with 10% ECM (Sigma) in
Hanks Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) and washed three
times in HBSS. Thereafter, GBM cells were maintained
in adherent culture on ECM-coated plates in TSM media,
which was changed every 2 to 3 days.

using Living Image and IgorPro Software (v 2.50) and data
were expressed as total photon flux (photons per second).
Generally, the first mouse images were obtained 3-5 days
following intracranial inoculation, then weekly. Data were
analyzed and plotted as the ratio of bioluminescence on a
given treatment day over bioluminescence on the first day.

In vivo Drug Treatment
Mice were imaged two times after implantation of
cells to identify those with equivalent tumor growth rates.
Two weeks after tumor cell implantation, cohorts of mice
with approximately equivalent tumor bioluminescence
were divided into control and treatment groups (5-6
mice per group per cohort). POL5551 was delivered as
a continuous subcutaneous infusion. An osmotic pump
(Alzet® model 2004, 28 day delivery) was inserted
subcutaneously into each mouse and contained either PBS
or POL5551 (8mg/kg or 80mg/kg). Prior to insertion, mice
were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride at 150 mg/
kg and xylazine at 12 mg/kg (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals,
St Joseph, MO) via i.p. injection. The incision was closed
with Vetbond (3M, St. Paul, MN). mcr84 (10mg/kg [35])
or IgG antibody were injected i.p. twice weekly for 4
weeks.
Mice were euthanized per protocol if they exhibited
weight loss of greater than 15% or displayed neurological
symptoms. Blood samples were collected for plasma
analysis. All mice were perfused with PBS; a subset
was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. If fixed, brains
were stored in paraformaldehyde for 24 hours, then 15%
sucrose for 24 hours, then 30%-sucrose for 24 hours.
Brains were embedded in OTC and stored at -80’C. 1012um sections were made for immunostaining. The brains
of mice perfused only with PBS were frozen in liquid
nitrogen then stored at -80’C. Tumor-bearing cortex and
non-tumor-bearing (contralateral) cortex from these brains
were further processed for determination of POL5551
concentration.

In vitro drug treatments
Primary tumor cells were thawed, counted and equal
numbers of cells were plated in ultra-low adherent 6 well
plates in 2mls of regular TSM supplemented with 10 μg/
mL IgG (vehicle), or mcr84 alone (10μg/mL), POL5551
(1μg/mL) and IgG, or POL5551 and mcr84 together. The
CD133+ cell fractions were measured 72 hrs later using
CD133 conjugated microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech) using
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, tumorspheres were
dissociated using trypsin and collagenase and incubated
with FC blocking buffer and CD133 microbeads for 30
min. The cells were washed in MACS buffer and loaded
on to the MACS columns. The columns was washed three
times, detached from the magnet and cells were eluted
in TSM. Cell number was counted using trypan blue
exclusion.

Generation of Intracranial xenografts
Intracranial xenografts were generated as previously
described [32, 33]. In brief, 50,000 U87 cells in 7.5uL
of PBS were injected into homozygous NCR nude mice
(Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) through a 27-gauge
needle over 2 minutes at 2mm lateral and posterior to the
bregma and 3mm below the dura.

Immunostaining
Sections (10um) were processed and analyzed as
described 37. For endoglin/nestin colabeling studies, tissue
sections were permeabilized with 0.025% Triton-X-100
and endogenous peroxidase, and nonspecific binding
sites were blocked as previously described [49]. Primary
antibody concentrations were as follows: Endoglin (R&D
systems AF1320, Goat, 1:200 dilution) and Nestin (Sigma
N5413, rabbit, 1:200 dilution). Staining was detected
using biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies augmented
by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Endoglin and
Nestin were visualized using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine
and the Vector VIP Peroxidase Substrate kit (DAKO),
respectively. Sections were counterstained with methyl

Bioluminescence imaging
Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was performed as
previously described [32, 33, 48]. Briefly, after injection
with 150 ug/g D-luciferin (Biosynth) in PBS (i.p.),
isoflurane-anesthetized mice were imaged with a chargecoupled device camera-based BLI system (IVIS 50;
Xenogen Corp., Alameda, CA; exposure time= 1-60 s,
binning=8, field of view=12, f/stop=1, open filter). Signals
were displayed as photons/s/cm2. Regions of interest were
defined manually at 95% of the maximum pixel output

green. Control sections were processed identically in the
absence of primary antibody.
Endoglin/albumin colabeling, and TUNEL and Ki67
staining was detected by immunofluorescence using the
secondary AlexaFluor 555–conjugated and AlexaFluor
488–conjugated secondary antibodies at a concentration
of 1:1200 (Molecular Probes) for 90 minutes. Primary
antibodies were as follows: albumin (Abcam Cat#:
ab2406, rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000 dilution), Endoglin
(R&D systems AF1320, Goat, 1:200 dilution), and Ki67
(Thermo Scientific RM-9106-S0, Rabbit monoclonal,
1:500 dilution.) Nuclei were counterstained with
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Control sections
were processed identically in the absence of primary
antibody.
TUNEL staining was performed using the TACS 2
TdT In situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Trevigen Cat# 481030-CK) per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, tissue
sections were treated with 5ug/ml proteinase K, followed
by incubation in labeling reaction mix (Tdt dNTP Mix,
TdT Enzyme, Mn2+ , and 1XTdT labeling Buffer, for
60 minutes at 37°C in humidified chamber, followed by
incubation with the 1X Tdt Stop Buffer. Sections were
washed in 1X PBS and incubated in AlexaFluor 568–
conjugated secondary antibody (1:1500) (Molecular
Probes) for 90 minutes. Nuclei were counterstained with
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Control sections
were processed identically in the absence of Tdt Enzyme.

Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version
4.00 (GraphPad Software). Kaplan-Meier survival
curves were analyzed using pairwise log-rank tests.
Statistical differences in tumor growth curves (measured
by bioluminescence) were analyzed using two-way
ANOVA. The effect of drug treatments on proliferation
and apoptosis were evaluated by two-tailed Fisher’s exact
test. The effects of drug treatments on stem cell fraction
were evaluated by two-tailed t-test.

POL5551 concentration
Pretreatment plasma samples and plasma, brain
and tumor tissue from the time of death were obtained
and stored at -20C. Samples were processed by Polyphor
by mass spectrometry analysis. Concentrations of
POL5551 in plasma and brain were determined using a
high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to mass
spectrometry detection (LC‑MS/MS analytical method).
Briefly, after addition of an internal standard, plasma
and brain homogenate samples (aliquot of 50 µL) were
extracted with acetonitrile (acidified with formic acid).
Supernatants were evaporated to dryness under a stream of
nitrogen, and reconstituted in H2O/ ACN, 95/5, v/v, +0.2%
formic acid. Extracts were then analyzed by reverse-phase
chromatography (Acquity BEH C18 column, 100 x 2.1
mm, 1.7 µm column), using an acidified water /acetonitrile
gradient elution (UPLC, Waters). The detection and
quantification was performed by mass spectrometry, with
electrospray interface in positive mode and selective
fragmentation of analytes (AB Sciex 4000 Q Trap mass
spectrometer). Standards, Quality Controls and samples
were extracted and assayed in the same manner.
