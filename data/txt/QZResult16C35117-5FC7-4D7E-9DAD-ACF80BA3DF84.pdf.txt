Abstract
The interaction between tumor cells and their microenvironment is an essential
aspect of tumor development. Therefore, understanding how this microenvironment
communicates with tumor cells is crucial for the development of new anti-cancer
therapies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that inhibit gene
expression. They are secreted into the extracellular medium in vesicles called
exosomes, which allow communication between cells via the transfer of their
cargo. Consequently, we hypothesized that circulating endothelial miRNAs could be
transferred to tumor cells and modify their phenotype. Using exogenous miRNA, we
demonstrated that endothelial cells can transfer miRNA to tumor cells via exosomes.
Using miRNA profiling, we identified miR-503, which exhibited downregulated levels
in exosomes released from endothelial cells cultured under tumoral conditions.
The modulation of miR-503 in breast cancer cells altered their proliferative and
invasive capacities. We then identified two targets of miR-503, CCND2 and CCND3.
Moreover, we measured increased plasmatic miR-503 in breast cancer patients after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which could be partly due to increased miRNA secretion
by endothelial cells. Taken together, our data are the first to reveal the involvement
of the endothelium in the modulation of tumor development via the secretion of
circulating miR-503 in response to chemotherapy treatment.

Introduction

progression, allowing access to oxygen and nutrients that
support tumor growth and eliminate metabolic waste.
Thus, angiogenesis, the process by which new blood
vessels arise from preexisting ones, is a crucial step in
the progression of tumor development and metastases
dissemination, and the blockade of angiogenesis is a
promising strategy for the development of new cancer
therapies [3]. However, drugs that inhibit tumor blood
vessel formation by blocking the VEGF pathway have
presently produced limited improvement in the clinical

The tumor microenvironment includes a variety
of cell types: fibroblasts, immune and endothelial cells,
pericytes, and local and bone marrow-derived cells,
surrounded by matrix components [1]. The crosstalk of this
microenvironment with tumor cells is essential for tumor
development, adaptation and metastasis formation [2].
Moreover, the blood supply plays a crucial role in cancer

setting [4]. Consequently, a better understanding of
the interactions between cancer cells and the tumor
microenvironment is necessary to unravel the complexity
of tumor physiology and to limit the development of
resistance mechanisms during anti-cancer treatments.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs
that are essential for the regulation of various physiological
and pathological processes, including development,
differentiation, proliferation and cancer [5,6]. These
transcripts bind to the 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs)
of messenger RNAs to either induce their degradation
or inhibit their translation into proteins [7,8]. Cell-free
miRNAs were found inside exosomes within biological
fluids a few years ago [9,10]. Exosomes are small
vesicles, ranging from 30 to 100 nm in size, composed
of RNAs, microRNAs, and soluble and membranous
proteins [11,12]. There is accumulating evidence that these
organelles play a key role in intercellular communication
via the transfer of their molecular contents [13–15].
Furthermore, recent findings demonstrate that circulating
miRNAs are promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of
several pathologies, demonstrating the notable abilities
to discriminate between cancer types and stages and to
monitor treatment responses [16–18].
Several studies have demonstrated that
tumor exosomes are able to modulate the tumor
microenvironment by activating angiogenesis, promoting
the formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
and modulating the immune response [19–22]. However,
little information is known regarding the role of exosomes
derived from cells of the tumor microenvironment on the
regulation of tumor cell metabolism. In the present study,
we examined the potential transfer of miRNAs from
endothelial to tumor cells via exosomes and their role
in tumor behavior. We identified the endothelial miRNA
miR-503, the expression of which is regulated by breast
cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy and which is able to
inhibit tumor cell proliferation and invasion.

the membranous protein composition of the exosomes is
representative of the originating cells, we compared the
presence of endothelial markers on HUVECs and HUVEC
exosomes. As expected, both compartments presented a
similar composition of markers, including αvβ3 integrins,
CD31, CD105, E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and
VE-cadherin. However, VEGFR2, which was strongly
expressed on HUVECs, was not found on exosomes (Fig.
1D and Fig. S1A-P). In addition, electron microscopy
visualization of the exosomes also revealed a characteristic
cup-shaped morphology, with a diameter of approximately
100 nm. Furthermore, immunogold labeling was positive
for the exosome marker CD63 and the endothelial marker
CD105 (Fig. 1E).
Next, using an exogenous mouse miRNA that is
not conserved in humans, mmu-miR-298, we sought to
investigate the ability of endothelial cells to transfer
miRNAs to human tumor cells. The miRNA was
overexpressed in HUVECs, and the transfection efficiency
was monitored using qRT-PCR (Fig. S1Q). Transfected
HUVECs were then placed in a transwell coculture system
with the cells separated by a membrane with 0.2-µm pores
to prevent the transfer of miRNAs from other vesicles.
This assay was applied to four tumor cell lines (lung
carcinoma: A549, colorectal carcinoma: HCT116, breast
adenocarcinoma: MDA-MB-231, and glioblastoma: U87)
(Fig. 1F). Whereas HCT116 cells presented markedly low
levels of mmu-miR-298, the three other tumor cell lines
showed significant incorporation of the exogenous miRNA
after 48 h. Exosomes were also purified from endothelial
cells overexpressing mmu-miR-298, and the presence of
the miRNA in exosomes was assessed using qRT-PCR
(Fig. S1R). In addition, mmu-miR-298- and controlloaded exosomes were incubated with the various tumor
cell lines. As observed in the coculture system, mmumiR-298 was detected in all cell lines, but HCT116 cells
still displayed reduced transfer levels (Fig. 1G).
To study the interaction of endothelial exosomes
with tumor cells, we labeled exosomes with the fluorescent
lipid dye PKH67 and monitored uptake by the four tumor
cell lines. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that all
of the cell lines took up the exosomes, but the uptake
by HCT116 cells was less pronounced (Fig. 1I). This
observation was confirmed via flow cytometry (Fig. 1H).
Notably, the exosome incorporation profile was similar to
the mmu-miR-298 levels transferred via either coculture
or endothelial exosomes, suggesting a major contribution
by exosomes in the transfer of miRNAs. Moreover, the
variation in uptake efficiencies between different tumor
cell types strongly suggests the selective incorporation of
endothelial exosomes. To further visualize the mechanism
of exosome capture, we monitored exosome uptake over
time using electron microscopy. For that experiment, we
chose the MDA-MB-231 cell line, as these cells displayed
a high level of exosome incorporation. If no exosomes
were added to tumor cells, no specific patterns could be

Results
Endothelial exosomes allow the transfer of
miRNAs to tumor cells
To investigate the role of circulating endothelial
miRNAs on tumor cell physiology, we prospectively
isolated and characterized exosomes from human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). As
demonstrated by dynamic light scattering, exosomes
from endothelial cells show the typical size range of these
vesicles, with a maximum peak at approximately 95 nm
(Fig. 1A). Flow cytometry analysis also confirmed the
presence of two well-known exosomal markers, CD63
and CD9, on the exosome surface (Fig. 1B-C). Because

observed inside the endocytic vesicles. However, after
2 hours, entities with the characteristic cup shape of
exosomes could already be observed inside the endosomes;
these entities accumulated over time, as observed after 8
and 24 h (Fig. 1J). These data demonstrate that endothelial
exosomes are taken up by tumor cells via endocytosis to
allow the intercellular transfer of miRNAs.

Several studies have shown that miRNAs can be
transferred from tumor cells to modulate angiogenesis.
Here, we speculated that the exchange could also occur
in the opposite direction. We hypothesized that tumor
cells might elicit an anti-tumor response through the
secretion of miRNAs from the endothelium. We thus

investigated the miRNA content of endothelial exosomes
to identify miRNAs that could modify tumor growth. We
first performed miRNA expression profiles using PCR
panels (Exiqon) to compare between HUVECs and their
exosomes. As observed in other studies [9,23], most of
the miRNAs were expressed at similar levels in cells and
exosomes, although some were detected only in cells (10
miRNAs) or in exosomes (16 miRNAs) (Fig. 2A-B and
Fig. S2A). To identify endothelial miRNAs that could

affect tumor development, we then profiled the miRNA
content of exosomes from HUVECs cultured in a basal
medium or in a tumor-mimicking medium enriched with
growth factors. Basal medium was composed of 5% serum
whereas tumoral medium contained a mix of growth
factors optimized for HUVECs culture supplemented
everyday with high doses of VEGF (50 ng/ml) and bFGF
(20 ng/ml). Indeed, these two molecules are well-known
activators of tumor angiogenesis [24]. As measured by

protein quantification, the first notable observation was
the radical decrease in the level of exosome secretion
in HUVECs cultured in the tumor medium compared
with those cultured in the basal medium (Fig. 2C). Only
miRNAs that were detected in all samples, displayed
a variation lower than 2 between replicates and an
individual Ct value lower than 40 were considered for
further analysis. These criteria led to the selection of 204
miRNAs (Fig. S2B). When comparing the miRNA ratio
derived from exosomes and HUVECs, 108 miRNAs were
found to be modulated in HUVEC-derived exosomes by
at least twofold (Fig. 2 D-E and Table S1). As shown in
the volcano plot, the 3 most upregulated miRNAs were
miR-502-5p, miR-744 and miR-373*, whereas the most
downregulated miRNAs were miR-146a, miR-205 and
miR-503 (Fig. 2D-E). For further investigation, we
examined the 3 most downregulated miRNAs, which,
according to our hypothesis, might exhibit antitumor
properties. The decreased miR-146a and miR-503 levels
in tumoral and basal exosomes were confirmed using
TaqMan microRNA assays; however, we were unable
to confirm the alteration in miR-205 levels (Fig. 2F-G).
Interestingly, we observed that miR-146a levels were
also decreased in the exosome-producing endothelial

cells, whereas miR-503 levels were not modified under
tumor-mimicking conditions (Fig. 2H-I). We then decided
to further study miR-503 because this miRNA undergoes
a selective export mechanism under tumor-mimicking
conditions. In addition, miR-503 is a member of the
extended miR-16 family, which has been widely described
in the literature as an anti-tumor miRNA that regulates
cell cycle progression and the proliferation status of cells
[25–27].

Endothelial miR-503 impairs tumor growth in
vitro
To investigate the impact of miR-503 on tumor
growth, we performed gain- and loss-of-function studies.
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with either preor anti-miR-503, and the transfection efficiency was
monitored using qRT-PCR (Fig. S3A). We used MDAMB-231 constitutively expressing luciferase to quantify
the proliferation in a coculture system by measuring
the luminescence. Moreover, tumor cell invasion was
assessed by quantifying the sprouting of tumor spheroids
in a 3D collagen matrix. Increasing miR-503 levels

via the transfection of miRNA mimics (pre-miRs) in
MDA-MB-231 cells decreased both cell proliferation
and invasion. Conversely, inhibition of miR-503 via the
transfection of miR-503 antisense LNAs (anti-miRs)
resulted in increased levels both of these processes
compared with those of the control (Fig. 3A-B). Moreover,
the effects of modulating miR-503 on tumor proliferation
and invasion were confirmed by measuring BrdU
incorporation and performing Boyden chamber assays,
respectively (Fig. S3B-C).
We next sought to explore the effect of endothelialderived miR-503 on MDA-MB-231 cells. For this
purpose, HUVECs were transfected with pre-miR-503,
and the transfection efficiency was monitored using qRTPCR (Fig. S3D). The effective transfer of the miRNA was
then assessed using endothelial exosomes loaded with
miR-503. Upon incubation of miR-503-loaded exosomes
with MDA-MB-231 cells, we observed increased miRNA
levels in the cells using qRT-PCR (Fig. 3C). We next
investigated whether miR-503 secreted from endothelial
cells could modify the phenotype of MDA-MB-231 cells.
HUVECs overexpressing miR-503 were cocultured with
MDA-MB-231 cells, which led to reduced tumor cell
proliferation and invasion compared with those under

control conditions (Fig. 3D-E). Importantly, the addition
of anti-miR-503 into tumor cells rescued the effects of
endothelial miR-503 in both functional assays. This
observation suggest that miR-503 is the main effector
of tumor cell proliferation and invasion inhibition in
endothelial exosomes. To confirm that these effects
were caused by the transfer of endothelial miR-503 via
exosomes, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with miRNAloaded HUVEC exosomes. This treatment also resulted in
reduced MDA-MB-231 proliferation compared with the
cells treated with mock HUVEC exosomes (Fig. 3F).

MiR-503 inhibits CCND2 and CCND3 expression
of MDA-MB-231
To explore the molecular mechanism responsible
for the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and invasion
by miR-503, we searched for target genes of the miRNA
involved in those mechanisms. We used a computational
approach involving the Targetscan algorithm (http://www.
targetscan.org/) to obtain a list of genes predicted to be
targets of miR-503. We then used the STRING algorithm
(http://string-db.org/), which creates a network between

proteins that have functional or physical interactions,
to identify associations between predicted targets of
miR-503. We observed the presence of a large cluster of
proteins that influence cell cycle progression and pathways
that regulate the proliferation/apoptosis status of cells
(Fig. S4C). Using qRT-PCR, we tested a subset of miR503 target genes that displayed many links with each other
to identify the genes responsible for the observed antitumor phenotype. From this subset of genes, we identified
two targets of miR-503, CCND2 and CCND3, which
are downregulated at the RNA and protein levels upon
overexpression of the miRNA (Fig. 4A-C). Importantly,
inhibiting endogenous miR-503 using anti-miR
transfection led to increased CCND2 and CCND3 protein
levels. The interaction sites of miR-503 and the CCND2
and CCND3 3’-UTRs are pictured in Fig S4D. Notably,
expression of the homologue CCND1 was not affected
by miR-503 even though this gene is a validated target of
miR-503 (Fig. S4A-B). Because CCND2 has never been
described as a target of miR-503, we analyzed whether
the miRNA directly interacts with its 3’-UTR. Indeed,
there are 3 binding sites for miR-503 in the CCND2 3’UTR: one 8-mer site and two 7-mer-1A sites. We therefore
constructed a luciferase reporter vector that encoded the
3’-UTR of CCND2 downstream of the luciferase coding
sequence. Reduced luciferase activity was observed
in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with the vector;
these cells were also observed to overexpress miR-503
compared with that of the control (Fig. 4D). Moreover,
when the sequences that bind the seed region of miR-503
were mutated in the CCND2 3’-UTR, the miRNA was no
longer able to inhibit translation of the luciferase mRNA,
leading to normalized luminescence levels.
We next determined whether the inhibition of
CCND2 and CCND3 was responsible for the inhibition of
tumor cell proliferation and invasion observed upon miR503 modulation. Indeed, silencing CCND2 and CCND3
in MDA-MB-231 cells with siRNA led to decreased
proliferation and invasion (Fig. 4E-F). Taken together,
these results demonstrate that endothelial-derived miR503 induces the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and
invasion via inhibition of CCND2 and CCND3.

biopsies and in residual tumors of patients subjected to
this treatment and presenting an incomplete pathological
response. Surprisingly, no changes in the miR-503
levels were observed before treatment or after postchemotherapy surgery (Fig. 4C and F). This observation
favors the view that the increased miR-503 levels in
the circulation after chemotherapy do not come from
the tumor. Thus, we decided to investigate whether
endothelial cells could be responsible for the increased
miR-503 levels upon neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We
treated endothelial cells with both chemotherapeutic
agents (epirubicin and paclitaxel) used in the treatment
and analyzed the consequences on miR-503 expression
and exosome secretion using qRT-PCR. We first observed
a drastic increase in exosome production in endothelial
cells treated with the chemotherapeutic agents; this effect
was more pronounced with paclitaxel than with epirubicin
treatment (Fig. 4G). Moreover, we observed increased
miR-503 levels in exosomes following epirubicin and
paclitaxel treatments compared with control conditions,
whereas decreased levels were observed in exosomeproducing HUVECs (Fig. 4H-I). These data suggest
that the elevated circulating miR-503 levels observed in
patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy could originate
in part from exosome modification and miR-503 secretion
by endothelial cells.

Discussion
Over the past few years, exosomes have emerged
as important players in intercellular communication.
Notably, several studies have demonstrated the role of
tumor exosomes in regulating major processes of tumor
progression, such as angiogenesis, immune modulation
and metastasis dissemination. However, until now, the
effects of exosomes secreted from endothelial cells on
tumor cells has not been explored. Endothelial exosomes
have been shown to induce several mechanisms, such as
the regulation of angiogenesis in other endothelial cells
[28,29] and the atheroprotective stimulation of smooth
muscle cells [15]. It is well known that cells within
the tumor microenvironment can act on tumor cells.
In this context, a role for exosomes has emerged in the
recent literature. For example, exosomes secreted from
mesenchymal stem cells can regulate tumor growth,
whereas exosomes from dendritic cells can induce tumor
regression [30–32]. In this study, we demonstrate that
endothelial cells, which are also important players in
the tumor environment, produce exosomes that are able
to transfer miRNAs to tumor cells. Our data reveal that
this transfer involves endocytosis because incorporated
exosomes are observed in endocytic vesicles inside tumor
cells.
An important finding of our work is the observation
that the miRNA content of endothelial exosomes differs
from that of the producing cells. This phenomenon has

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases circulating

To study the potential endothelial release of miR503 during cancer, we analyzed the plasmatic miR-503
levels in breast cancer patients subjected to various
therapies. Interestingly, we observed increased miR-503
levels in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy
treatment, whereas no changes were observed in patients
treated only with surgery (Fig. 4A-B and D-E). To
more deeply investigate the influence of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, miR-503 levels were analyzed in tumor

been described in other studies and demonstrates that, at
least in part, miRNAs can be selectively packaged into
exosomes [9,23]. In addition, our profiling experiment also
revealed that the miRNA content of exosomes is altered
by the culture conditions. This experiment led to the
identification of miR-503, the exosome levels of which are
decreased under tumor conditions despite cellular levels
being unaffected. Notably, miR-424, which belongs to
the same cluster as miR-503, also showed reduced levels

under the same conditions. MiR-503 is known to inhibit
proliferation, migration and tube formation in endothelial
cells under high-glucose stress conditions [33]. Moreover,
miR-503 has been widely described in the literature as
an anti-tumor miRNA that regulates the expression of
key cell cycle proteins, such as CDC25A and cyclins D1
and E1, as well as cell proliferation via E2F3 and PI3K
regulation and the apoptosis status via BCL-2 inhibition
[6,25–27,33,34]. Notably, miR-503 also prevents tumor

growth by interacting with the tumor microenvironment
and reducing secretion of the proangiogenic factors FGF2
and VEGF by tumor cells [35]. We obtained similar results
by modulating the expression of miRNA in MDA-MB-231
cells. The overexpression of miR-503 led to decreased
tumor cell proliferation and invasion in multiple assays,
whereas its inhibition presented opposite results. The role
of endothelial miR-503 contained in exosomes has also
been investigated by coculturing HUVECs overexpressing
miR-503 with tumor cells. This manipulation also led to
reduced proliferative and invasive properties, which could
be reversed by adding anti-miR-503 to MDA-MB-231
cells. During investigation of the mRNA targets of miR503 to explain these effects, we identified that miR-503
regulated cyclins D2 and D3. Cyclin D3 is already a
validated target of miR-503; however, the regulation of
the cyclin D2 had not yet been demonstrated [26]. Overall,
these data showed that endothelial cells cultured under
tumoral conditions released miR-503, which can have
antitumoral effects, into the medium.
Our human studies revealed a role for miR-503
in response to neoadjuvant therapy. Plasmatic miR503 levels were elevated in breast cancer patients
receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. As suggested by
our in vitro data, the elevation of miR-503 in the blood
after chemotherapy could originate, at least in part,
from the increased secretion of miR-503 by endothelial
cells following paclitaxel and epirubicin treatment.
Because decreased miR-503 expression was observed in
exosome-producing endothelial cells, it is likely that the
chemotherapeutic agent promotes the transfer of miR-503
to exosomes rather than the induction of its expression.

A similar effect has been reported in endothelial cells
submitted to ionizing radiation [36]. On the other hand,
plasmatic levels of miR-503 of patients treated only with
surgery, and tumor levels of miR-503 of patients under
chemotherapy were not affected. Therefore, it is likely
that endothelial circulating miR-503 would originate
from the entire endothelium. As previously described
by other studies, anthracyclines and taxanes induce an
endothelial toxicity which also affects endothelial cells
outside of the tumor [37]. Therefore, miR-503 might
act as a stress-induced miRNA that is essential for cell
cycle regulation. Its expression is increased upon serum
starvation of mesenchymal stem cells and is modulated
according to cell cycle progression [38,39]. Thus, we
propose a model in which endothelial cells, in response
to unfavorable conditions, such as chemotherapy or
radiation treatment, release circulating miR-503 into the
surrounding environment (Fig. 5). Endothelial exosomes
loaded with miR-503 might then inhibit tumor growth
by acting directly on tumor cells, thereby contributing
to the direct effect of these therapies. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report of a miRNA transferred
from endothelial cells to tumor cells via exosomes. Our
data also reveal the involvement of the endothelium in the
modulation of tumor development upon chemotherapy
treatment. In this context, miR-503 appears to be an
antitumor miRNA secreted by endothelial cells that is
able to regulate tumor cell proliferation and invasion
via the inhibition of CCND2 and CCND3. This process
might complement the direct effects of chemotherapy and
thereby help the host fight the tumor.

Figure 6: Endothelial transfer of miR-503 elicit antitumor response during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Endothelial cells
treated with chemotherapeutic agents release more exosomes that contain more miR-503. MiR-503 loaded exosomes induce a reduction of
breast cancer cells proliferation and invasion caused by the inhibition of CCND2 and CCND3.

Materials and Methods

Dynamic light scattering
Exosomes were suspended in PBS at a concentration
of 50 µg/mL, and analyses were performed with a
Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Ltd.). Intensity,
volume and distribution data for each sample were
collected on a continuous basis for 4 min in sets of 3.

Cell culture
The isolation and culture of HUVECs (passages
6–11) were previously described [40]. A549 and U87
cells were cultured in EMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS. HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium
supplemented with 10% FBS. MDA-MB-231 cells were
cultured in DMEM 4500 supplemented with 10% FBS.

Flow cytometry
Cells were first saturated for 30 min in PBS
containing 5% BSA and incubated for 1 h at 4°C with
the following antibodies: anti-αvβ3 integrin (Chemicon),
anti-CD9 (Santa Cruz), anti-CD31 (Dako), anti-CD63
(BD-Biosciences), anti-CD105 (Dako), anti-E-selectin
(Abcam), anti-ICAM-1 (Abcam), anti-V-CAM1 (Abcam),
anti-VE-Cadherin (Enzo Life Sciences) and anti-VEGFR2
(Cell Signaling). Cells were then incubated with a biotincoupled secondary antibody for 30 min and then incubated
with streptavidin-PE for 30 min before being analyzed
on the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Exosomes were incubated for 30 min with latex beads
(Invitrogen), then the exosome-coated beads were
subjected to the same steps.

Cell transfections and treatments
Pre-miRs (25 nM; Ambion) and anti-miRs (25
nM; Exiqon) were transfected into HUVECs and MDAMB-231 cells using Dharmafect-4 (Dharmacon Research
Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
CCND2, CCND3 and control siRNAs (20 nM) were
transfected based on the calcium phosphate transfection
method. Transfected HUVECs and MDA-MB-231 cells
were plated in EGM2 or complete DMEM, respectively.
After a 24-hour transfection, the cells were washed and
kept in their media for an additional 48 or 72 hours.
Functional assays were performed as described above.

Patients

Exosome purification

Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional
Review Board (Ethical Committee of the Faculty of
Medicine of the University of Liège) in compliance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients with newly diagnosed
primary breast cancer were prospectively recruited at
CHU of Liège (Liège, Belgium) from July 2011 to July
2013. All patients signed a written informed consent form.
This work consisted of a prospective study and did not
influence the treatment of the enrolled patients; 29 patients
were included in this study. Blood samples were collected
into 9-mL EDTA-containing tubes. Plasma was prepared
within 1 h by retaining the supernatant after double
centrifugation at 4°C (10 min at 815 g and 10 min at 2500
g), then stored at -80°C.
Seventeen patients with primary locally advanced
breast cancer received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)
with 3 or 4 courses of alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide
or fluorouracil) and anthracycline-based chemotherapy
(epirubicin) followed by 3 or 12 courses of tubulinbinding agents (docetaxel or paclitaxel). Eight of these
patients did not achieved pathological complete response
(ypT0N0, following the AJCC-UICC classification)
For those 8 non responders, 4-μm tumor slices from
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues samples
were obtained from diagnostic core-needle biopsies (2
to 3 passes in the primary tumor) and the corresponding
remaining tumor. The histological statuses of all 8 tissues

Exosomes were isolated and purified from the
supernatants of HUVEC cultures using the differential
centrifugations. HUVECs were cultured in EGM2 medium
containing exosome-depleted serum. After 72 h, the
medium was collected and centrifuged at 2000 g for 15
min at 4°C and then again at 12,000 g for 45 min at 4°C.
Supernatants were then passed through a 0.22-μm filter
(Millipore) and ultracentrifuged at 110,000 g for 90 min at
4°C. The pellets were then washed with phosphate buffer
saline (PBS), followed by a second ultracentrifugation
at 110,000 g for 90 min at 4 °C, then resuspended in
PBS. The protein levels of the exosome preparations
were measured using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce)
following the manufacturer’s instructions.

PKH67 labeling of exosomes
Exosomes were labeled with PKH67 dye (Sigma)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and
incubated with cells for 24 h. The cells were then washed
2 times with PBS and mounted on a slide for observation
under a fluorescence microscope.

Cell coculture and functional assays

samples were established with hematoxylin and eosin
staining of the FFPE sections by a pathologist.
Circulating miR-503 levels were also analyzed in a
cohort of twelve primary breast cancer patients that did not
receive any chemotherapy, and their plasma was collected
8 days before and 3 months after surgery.

For cocultures, endothelial donor cells were seeded
onto 6-well plates. After 8 hours, transwells were added,
and tumor cells were seeded onto the inner part of the
transwell membranes. After 48 h of incubation, tumor cells
were collected and analyzed.

Electron microscopy of whole-mounted immunolabelled exosomes

Proliferation assays

Exosome were placed on Formvar-carbon coated
nickel grids for 1 h, washed 3 times with PBS and fixed
with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After 3 washes,
grids were then incubated for 2 h with the following
antibodies: anti-CD63 or anti-CD105. Exosomes were
then washed 5 times and incubated with a 10 nm-gold
labeled secondary antibody. They were washed 5 more
times and post-fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 10
min. Samples were contrasted using 2.5% uranyl acetate
for 10 min followed by 4 washes and an incubation of
10 min in lead citrate. Grids were finally washed 4 times
in deionized water and examined with a JEOL JEM-1400
transmission electron microscope at 80 kV.

For the luminescence proliferation assay, MDAMB-231 cells were transfected or incubated with
transfected HUVECs on a 24-well plate. After 48 h,
150 µg/mL of luciferin was added per well, and the
luminescence was quantified using the bioluminescent
IVIS imaging system (Xenogen-Caliper).
For the BrdU incorporation assay, MDA-MB-231
cells were transfected and seeded into 96-well plates for 40
h. BrdU was added for 8 h, and proliferation was assessed
using the Cell Proliferation ELISA BrdU (colorimetric) kit
(Roche) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Spheroid invasion assay

Electron microscopy of exosome uptake in MDAMB-231

Spheroids were prepared as previously described
[41]. Briefly, spheroids composed of transfected MDAMB-231 alone or with transfected HUVECs were allowed
to form in 96-U-well suspension plates for 48 h. Spheroids
were then collected and seeded for 48 h inside a 3D
collagen matrix with culture medium. Pictures were taken
to quantify the invasion level by measuring the area of
invasion using ImageJ software.

MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with exosomes
(final concentration, 20 μg/mL) dissolved in PBS. After 0,
2, 8 and 24 h pre-incubation, the MDA-MB-231 cells were
washed with PBS and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/1%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) for 2 h at 4°C.
Then, the cells were washed 3 times in PBS for 10 min at
4°C and post-fixed for 30 min with 2% osmium tetroxide.
After dehydration in graded ethanol, samples were
embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were obtained with
a Reichert Ultracut S ultramicrotome then contrasted with
uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Observations were made
with a JEOL JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope
at 80 kV.

Boyden chamber assay
Transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded
into 8-µm 24-well Boyden chambers (Transwell; Costar
Corp) and subjected to cell invasion assays. The lower
chamber was filled with 600 μL of complete DMEM, and
transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were placed in 300 μL of
free DMEM in the upper chamber and allowed to migrate
for 4 h at 37°C. After fixation, cells were stained with 4%
Giemsa and counted on the lower side of the membrane
using ImageJ software.

MicroRNA profiling
Total RNA was extracted with the miRNeasy kit
(Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol, and celmiR-39 and cel-miR-238 were spiked into the exosome
samples. Reverse transcription was then performed
using the miRCURY LNA™ Universal RT microRNA
PCR, polyadenylation and cDNA synthesis kit (Exiqon,
Denmark). Quantitative PCR was performed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions on microRNA Ready-toUse PCR panel 1. The controls included reference genes,
inter-plate calibrators run in triplicate (Sp3) and negative
controls.

Chemotherapy treatment of endothelial cells
HUVECs were cultured in EGM2 supplemented
with 1 µg/mL epirubicin or 20 ng/mL paclitaxel. After
24 h, the medium was swapped with exosome-depleted
medium, and the cells were cultured for 72 additional
hours before being collected for exosome purification.

stem loop primers (Applied Biosystems). The resulting
cDNAs were used for quantitative real-time PCR using
the TaqMan microRNA assay and TaqMan universal
PCR master mix reagents (Applied Biosystems). Thermal
cycling was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7900
HT detection system (Applied Biosystems). For the cells,
the relative miRNA levels were normalized to 2 internal
controls, RNU-44 or RNU-48. For the plasma and
exosomes, the relative miRNA levels were normalized
to the 2 spiked-in miRNAs: cel-miR-39 and cel-miR-238
(Applied Biosystems).
For mRNA expression analysis, RNA was
extracted using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA synthesis was
performed with 1 μg of total RNA and the iScript cDNA
Synthesis kit (BioRad), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The resulting cDNA transcripts (20 ng)
served as the template for quantitative real-time PCR
using the SYBR green method (Roche Applied Sciences).
Thermal cycling was performed on an ABI Prism 7900 HT
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). For
all reactions, no-template controls were run, and random
RNA preparations were also subjected to sham reverse
transcription to verify the absence of genomic DNA
amplification. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed
using the SYBR green method (Bioline and Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Thermal cycling was performed on an
Applied Biosystems 7900 HT detection system (Applied
Biosystems). The relative transcript level of each gene
was normalized to the housekeeping genes cyclophilin-A
(PPIA) and/or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH). Primers were designed using Primer Express
software and selected to span exon-exon junctions to
avoid the detection of genomic DNA (primer sequences
are provided below).

Cells were washed with PBS and scraped
into lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 7.5); 1%
NP40; 0.5% sodium desoxycholate; 1 mM EDTA;
protease inhibitor cocktail cOmplete Mini, EDTA free
(Roche)] on ice. Insoluble cell debris was removed
by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 15 min. Aliquots of
protein-containing supernatant were stored at -20°C, and
protein concentrations were measured using the BCA
Protein Assay kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Soluble cell lysates (50 μg) were resolved using
SDS-PAGE (12%) and transferred to polyvinylidene
fluoride membranes (Millipore). Blots were blocked
overnight with 8% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1%
Tween 20 and probed for 1 h with the following primary
antibodies: anti-CCND1 (Cell Signaling), anti-CCND2
(Cell Signaling), anti-CCND3 (Cell Signaling), and
anti-beta-tubulin (ab6046, Abcam). After 3 washes with
Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, antigenantibody complexes were detected with a peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody and the enhanced fluorochemiluminescent system (ECL; Pierce Biotechnology).
Quantifications were performed using ImageJ software
and are presented in bar graphs normalized to the levels of
the corresponding loading control (β-tubulin).
