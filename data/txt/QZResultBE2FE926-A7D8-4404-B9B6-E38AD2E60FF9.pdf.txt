BACKGROUND: There is a debate regarding the management of ovarian immature teratomas (ITs). In adult women, postoperative
chemotherapy is standard except for stage I, grade 1 disease, whereas surgery alone is standard in pediatric patients. To determine
the role of chemotherapy, a pooled analysis of pediatric and adult clinical trials was conducted. METHODS: Data from 7 pediatric trials and 2 adult trials were merged in the Malignant Germ Cell International Collaborative data set. Four trials included patients with
newly diagnosed pure ovarian ITs and were selected (Pediatric Oncology Group/Children’s Cancer Group Intergroup Study
(INT 0106), Second UKCCSG Germ Cell Tumor Study (GC2), Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG 0078 and GOG 0090). Adult and
pediatric trials were analyzed separately. The primary outcome measures were event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: One hundred seventy-nine patients were included (98 pediatric patients and 81 adult patients). Ninety pediatric patients
were treated with surgery alone, whereas all adult patients received chemotherapy. The 5-year EFS and OS were 91% and 99%,
respectively, for the pediatric cohort and 87% and 93%, respectively, for the adults. There were no relapses in grade 1 patients, regardless of the stage or age. Only 1 adult patient with a grade 2 IT relapsed. Among grade 3 patients, the 5-year EFS was 0.92 (0.720.98) for stage I/II and 0.52 (0.22-0.75) for stage III in the pediatric cohort (P 5 .005) and 0.91 (0.69-0.98) for stage I/II and 0.65
(0.39-0.83) for stage III/IV in the adult cohort (P 5 .01). Postoperative chemotherapy did not decrease relapses in the pediatric
cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The grade was the most important risk factor for relapse in ovarian ITs. Among grade 3 patients, the stage
was significantly associated with relapse. Adjuvant chemotherapy did not decrease relapses in the pediatric cohort; its role in adults

INTRODUCTION
Immature teratomas (ITs) of the ovary represent approximately 1% of ovarian tumors. ITs are a specific histological subtype of germ cell tumor (GCT) and are composed of tissues derived from all 3 embryonic layers: the mesoderm, the endoderm, and the ectoderm. They are graded according to the proportion of tissue containing immature neural elements. The
grade and stage of these tumors have been shown to be of prognostic significance and are, therefore, used to make therapeutic decisions.1,2
There is no consensus on the management of patients with ovarian ITs. Significant differences exist between pediatric and adult groups about the necessity and utility of chemotherapy for patients with higher grade and stage disease. Therapeutic recommendations for adult women are based on 2 seminal studies. In 1976, Norris et al3 performed a

retrospective analysis of 58 patients, and they observed an
18% recurrence rate for grade 2 tumors and a 70% recurrence rate for grade 3 tumors; this resulted in the recommendation to use chemotherapy for grade 2 and 3
tumors. Gershenson et al4 reported outcomes for 41
patients with stage I to IV ovarian ITs and observed recurrences in 94% of the patients treated with surgery alone
versus 14% of the patients treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Henceforth, the standard of care for adult
women with ovarian ITs has been postoperative chemotherapy for all patients except those with stage I, grade 1
tumors.
Clinical practice in children has been led by evidence
provided by a pediatric intergroup trial (Pediatric Oncology Group/Children’s Cancer Group Intergroup Study
(INT) 0106) conducted in the United States. Patients
with completely resected ovarian ITs were observed
closely without postoperative chemotherapy.5,6 Fortyfour patients with completely resected ovarian ITs were
enrolled; 31 patients had pure ITs with tumor grade 1 (n
5 17), 2 (n 5 12), or 3 (n 5 2). Thirteen patients had microscopic foci of a yolk sac tumor. Gliomatosis peritonei
(GP) was present in 27% of the patients, and 3 of the 16
patients with lymph node sampling had nodal gliomatosis. At 4 years, the event-free survival (EFS) rate was
97.7% with an overall survival (OS) rate of 100%. This
study concluded that surgery alone is curative for children
with completely resected ovarian ITs, regardless of grade
or the presence of microscopic foci of a yolk sac tumor.5 A
similar study conducted in the United Kingdom followed
124 patients with ITs (54 ovarian ITs) after surgical resection.7 Eleven patients had GP, and 6 patients had nodal
gliomatosis. The EFS and OS rates were 85.9% and
95.1%, respectively, and the authors concluded that the
treatment of ovarian ITs is primarily surgical.
To highlight these differences and gain clarity into
the role of postoperative chemotherapy in the management of a pure IT of the ovary, we conducted a pooled
analysis. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG) and
the Children’s Cancer and Leukemia Group (CCLG)
agreed to merge 25 years of clinical trial data on pediatric
GCTs to form the Malignant Germ Cell International
Collaborative. Subsequently, data from the Gynecologic
Oncology Group (GOG) GCT clinical trials were added.
This report presents our analysis of pediatric and adult
patients with ovarian ITs. We compare these 2 groups and
identify similarities and differences with the goal of establishing a uniform treatment approach across all age
groups. Data from some of these trials have been previously published as separate reports.5,7,8

MATERIALS AND METHODS
After the signing of a memorandum of understanding,
which specified the variables to be included and how data
were to be de-identified, patient data from 7 GCT clinical
trials conducted by COG or CCLG between 1983 and
2009 were included in the Malignant Germ Cell International Collaborative data set. Data from 2 GOG clinical
trials were added subsequently. Four of the 9 trials
included patients with ITs. These were INT 0106
(COG), GC2 (CCLG), GOG 0078, and GOG 0090.
Each study had different eligibility criteria for the inclusion of IT patients. The INT 0106 study included
patients up to 21 years of age with biopsy-proven ITs
(stages I and II and grades 1-3). The presence of GP
within the abdomen or pelvis did not result in upstaging
in this study. The GC2 study included patients younger
than 16 years with biopsy-proven ITs (all stages and
grades). The pediatric studies included ITs at all sites in
both sexes. The GOG 0078 study included patients with
stage I, grade 2/3 ITs and completely resected stage II/III
ITs of all grades. The GOG 0090 protocol included
patients with incompletely resected stage II to IV, grade 1
to 3 ITs. Each trial had received research ethics board approval from the relevant agencies. This project was
approved by the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center
institutional review board.
From the larger data set, we selected only females
with a newly diagnosed pure IT of the ovary. Patients
with a mixed malignant GCT of the ovary and patients
with an extragonadal IT were excluded. Patient characteristics that were included in the data set were the age at diagnosis, histology, tumor markers, stage, grade,
administration of adjuvant chemotherapy (yes or no), and
clinical outcomes.
Staging

Patients treated with GOG protocols were staged with
International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics
(FIGO) staging,9 whereas pediatric patients were staged
with the COG or CCLG staging system.5,7 There are several differences between the COG/CCLG staging system
and the FIGO staging system. For instance, positive peritoneal washings are stage III in COG staging but can be
stage Ic or IIc in the FIGO system. Similarly, positive
lymph nodes are stage III in the FIGO system, but they
are stage II in the COG system if they are less than or
equal to 2 cm and are stage III if they are greater than
2 cm. Extension to the pelvis is stage IIb in the FIGO
system and stage III in the COG system. Because of irreconcilable differences in staging between these systems,
231

adult and pediatric patients were analyzed separately. A
few adolescents were treated with GOG protocols. They
were analyzed with the adult cohort because they were
staged and managed according to the adult treatment algorithm. Within the pediatric staging systems, a major difference between the COG and CCLG systems was that the
presence of GP in the COG system did not result in upstaging of stage I patients, whereas in the CCLG system,
patients with GP were classified as stage III. To resolve this
discrepancy, we retrospectively applied the CCLG staging
to COG patients so that all patients with GP were defined
as having stage III disease.
Grading

All tumors required central pathology review at the time
of enrollment by the respective cooperative group pathologist to confirm the histology, and they were graded
according to the criteria of Norris et al3 and Robboy and
Scully.10 Grade 1 was defined as immature tissue present
in <1 low-power field (43 objective) per slide, grade 2
was defined as immature tissue present in 1 to 3 lowpower fields (43 objective) per slide, and grade 3 was
defined as immature tissue present in >3 low-power fields
(43 objective) per slide.
Tumor Markers

Serum a-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were available for most
patients, and they were classified as normal if they were
<10 ng/mL and as elevated if they were 10 ng/mL.
Patients with AFP levels > 1000 ng/mL were excluded
because this level of AFP elevation was considered more
likely to indicate malignant GCT elements, which would
warrant more aggressive treatment.11
Treatment

Complete surgical excision at diagnosis was undertaken
when feasible. In the pediatric trials (INT 0106 and
GC2), chemotherapy was not recommended after surgery. However, some patients did receive chemotherapy
immediately after surgery at the discretion of the treating
physician. In the GOG trials (GOG 0078 and GOG
0090), chemotherapy was administered postoperatively
for all patients.
Statistical Analysis

The primary outcomes were EFS and OS. EFS was defined
as the time interval from the date of diagnosis to relapse or
progression, second malignancy, death, or date last seen
(whichever occurred first). Patients who experienced a
relapse, progression, or second malignancy were considered
to have experienced an event; otherwise, the patient was
232

censored at last contact. OS was defined as the time interval
from the date of diagnosis to death or date last seen (whichever occurred first). Patients who died, regardless of cause,
were considered to have experienced an event; otherwise,
the patient was censored at last contact.
The effects of various factors, including the age at
diagnosis, stage, grade, tumor marker levels, and treatment received, on the risk for an EFS event or death
were estimated with relative risk regression.12 We constructed survival curves with the Kaplan-Meier
method.13 Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for
the Kaplan-Meier estimates at specified time points were
calculated with the complementary log-log transformation.12 The 2-sided log-rank test for comparing EFS
across groups defined by the risk factors12 was used to
assess the prognostic significance of the characteristics
with P values < .05, which were considered significant.
For adult patients, a backwards stepwise procedure
was used to identify factors that were significantly associated with the risk for an EFS event. A selection probability
of .05 was used to retain factors in the model. Because of
issues with the collinearity of predictor variables, only the
stage and the grade could be entered into the starting model
for the selection process. All analyses were conducted with
Stata 13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
A total of 193 patients with pure ovarian ITs were identified from the 4 clinical trials. Six pediatric patients were
excluded because they had a mixed malignant GCT on
central review. Eight adult patients were excluded; 7
patients had recurrent ITs at the time of enrollment, and
1 patient had mixed malignant histology on central
review. One hundred seventy-nine patients with pure ITs
were included in the final analysis; 98 patients were
treated in the pediatric trials, and 81 patients were treated
in the adult GOG trials.
Characteristics, Treatment, and Outcomes of
Pediatric Patients

The characteristics of the pediatric patients are presented in
Table 1. The mean age at presentation was 10 years (range,
0-17 years). Sixty percent of the patients had stage I disease.
The mean serum AFP level was 83 6 182.7 ng/mL. Ninety
of the 98 patients were treated with surgery alone, and 8
patients received postoperative chemotherapy. The median
follow-up was 6.8 years (range, 1.7-14 years).
Nine of the 98 patients relapsed with 5-year EFS and
OS rates of 0.91 (0.84-0.95) and 0.99 (0.93-1.00), respectively. As shown in Table 2, there were no relapses in

patients with grade 1 or grade 2 tumors, regardless of stage.
Among patients with grade 3 tumors, 8 of 38 patients
(21%) relapsed. Stratifying grade 3 tumors by stage (Fig.
1), we found that the estimated 5-year EFS for patients
with grade 3, stage I/II disease was 0.92 (0.72-0.98),
whereas it was 0.52 (0.22-0.75) for grade 3, stage III
patients (P 5 .005). The OS for all grade 3 patients,
regardless of stage, was 100%. Neither the age at diagnosis
nor the AFP level was related significantly to the risk of
relapse. The administration of postoperative chemotherapy
did not decrease the risk of relapse in the pediatric cohort.
Table 3 outlines the clinical characteristics of the 9
pediatric patients who relapsed. All but 1 of the 9 patients
were salvaged (3 with surgery alone).

Characteristics, Treatment, and Outcomes of
Adult Patients

The characteristics of the 81 adult patients are outlined in
Table 4. Fifty-six percent of the patients had grade 3 disease, whereas 39% did in the pediatric cohort. In addition, 7% of the adult patients (but no pediatric patients)
had stage IV disease. The mean AFP level was 63.17 6
155.18 ng/mL. All patients, regardless of stage, were
treated with chemotherapy after surgery. The median
follow-up was 12 years (range, 0.3-21.9 years).
Eleven of the 81 patients relapsed with estimated 5year EFS and OS rates of 0.87 (0.77-0.93) and 0.93 (0.850.97), respectively. There were no relapses in patients with
grade 1 tumors, regardless of tumor stage. Among patients
with grade 2 tumors, only 1 of the 27 patients (3.7%)
relapsed; this patient had stage IIIc disease. Among patients
with grade 3 tumors, 9 of 45 patients (20%) experienced a
relapse. Stratifying grade 3 disease by stage, we found that
the estimated 5-year EFS for patients with grade 3, stage I/
II disease was 0.91 (0.69-0.98), whereas it was 0.65 (0.390.83) for grade 3, stage III/IV disease (P 5 .01). The estimated 5-year OS for grade 3, stage I/II disease was 0.91
(0.68-0.98), whereas it was 0.88 (0.61-0.97) for grade 3,
stage III/IV disease (P 5 .41; Fig. 2).
The extent of resection was not available in the database; however, the eligibility criteria for the adult studies
(GOG 0078 and GOG 0090) were based on the stage and
extent of resection. Patients with stage III disease were enrolled into GOG 0078 if they had undergone complete
resection and into GOG 0090 if they had undergone
incomplete resection. Stage IV patients were enrolled only
into GOG 0090. Stratifying the grade 3, stage III patients
by protocol, we found that the observed 5-year EFS was
0.75 (0.13-0.96) for GOG 0078 and 0.67 (0.28-0.88)
for GOG 0090. Because the numbers were so small

(9 patients in GOG 0090 and 4 patients in GOG 0078),
a log-rank test for this comparison was not performed.
Stepwise selection identified the grade and stage as
significantly associated with the risk of relapse (Table 5).
The age at diagnosis and the AFP level were not significant risk factors for relapse. Because all the adult patients
received postoperative chemotherapy, the effect of surgery
versus chemotherapy could not be assessed. Table 6 shows
the clinical characteristics of the patients who relapsed. Six
of the 11 patients died.
DISCUSSION
This combined analysis was performed in an attempt to
simultaneously compare pediatric and adult patients with

Figure 1. Event-free survival for pediatric patients with ovarian grade 3 immature teratomas by stage. Pediatric patients
with grade 3, stage I/II ovarian immature teratomas had a
significantly reduced risk for an event-free survival event in
comparison with patients with grade 3, stage III disease.

ovarian ITs to identify common risk factors and compare
outcomes for 2 cohorts with different treatment strategies.
Our analysis shows several striking similarities in the 2
groups, both in risk factors and in overall outcomes, despite differences in treatment. Risk factor analysis shows
that for ovarian ITs, grade is the most important risk factor for relapse across all age groups. In patients with grade
1 tumors, there were no relapses, regardless of stage.
Among the 47 pediatric and adult patients with grade 2
tumors, there was only a single relapse. This was an adult
patient with stage IIIc disease. The majority of relapses
occurred in patients with grade 3 tumors. Twenty percent
of the patients (17 of 83) with grade 3 tumors relapsed:
21% in the pediatric cohort and 20% in the adult cohort.
For patients with grade 3 tumors, the risk of relapse significantly differed by the stage at presentation. Grade 3
patients with stage I/II disease had excellent EFS in comparison with stage III/IV patients in both the pediatric
cohort and the adult cohort. In addition to stage, the completeness of resection influenced EFS. Adult patients were
enrolled in 2 protocols, with eligibility based on the stage
and extent of resection. Among grade 3, stage III patients,
the EFS was improved in patients with complete resection
versus those with incomplete resection.
There were important differences in the treatment
approach between the pediatric and adult cohorts in our
study. Only 8 of the 98 pediatric patients received chemotherapy, whereas all 81 adult patients received postoperative chemotherapy. Despite this, the 5-year EFS and OS
were higher in the pediatric cohort versus the adult cohort.
This difference in outcomes is likely a reflection of the tumor grade rather than treatment. Tumor grading varied

shown to be important risk factors for relapse.1,3,14 In the
study by Norris et al,3 the recurrence rate was 70% for
patients with grade 3 tumors and 18% for patients with
grade 2 tumors. In a study by Gobel et al,14 which
included 116 patients with extracranial ITs, 38 patients
underwent incomplete resection. They found that immaturity in incompletely resected teratomas was a risk factor
for relapse; there were no relapses in patients with completely resected ITs, even if they were grade 3 tumors.14 It,
therefore, appears that in patients with grade 3 tumors,
the stage and a lack of complete resection are associated
with an increased risk of relapse.
Similarly to our study, other pediatric studies have
shown no benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy postoperatively in the management of ovarian ITs. In a nonrandomized study by Gobel et al,14 76 patients were treated by
surgery alone, and 40 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. There was no reduction in the number of subsequent relapses in the IT group receiving chemotherapy.
However, risk factors were not balanced between the 2
treatment groups in this study.

Original Article

In contrast to the pediatric data, chemotherapy was
used for all the adult patients with pure ovarian ITs except
those with stage I, grade 1 tumors.3,4 Vicus et al15
reported on 34 women with ovarian ITs: 32 were at stage
I, 1 was at stage IIB, and 1 was at stage IIIA. Three of the
32 patients with stage I disease experienced recurrence,
and all of them had grade 2 or 3 disease. Consequently,
the authors recommended surveillance only for stage I,
grade 1 tumors and chemotherapy for stage I, grade 2/3
tumors.15 Recently, several studies in adults have questioned the role of chemotherapy for ITs. A multicenter
Italian trial (Multicenter Italian Trials in Ovarian Cancer
9) reported on 28 patients with stage I disease.16 Nineteen
patients were treated with surgery alone, and 9 patients
received adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy. Four of
19 patients treated with surgery alone and 2 of 19 patients
treated with adjuvant chemotherapy experienced recurrence. At recurrence, all patients were salvaged. The
authors concluded that all patients with stage I ovarian
ITs, regardless of grade, could be treated with surgery
alone, with chemotherapy reserved for recurrence. A UK
study by Patterson et al17 adopted a close surveillance program after surgery for all stage IA ovarian GCTs. Four of
15 patients relapsed, and only 1 of these patients could
not be salvaged. They recommended surveillance for all
stage IA ITs, regardless of grade. Bonazzi et al18 undertook a prospective trial of patients with pure ovarian ITs.
Surgery alone was recommended for patients with stage I/
II, grade 1/2 tumors. Twenty-two patients were followed
after surgery alone. Two patients relapsed after surgery
alone and were salvaged, and this led to the conclusion
that such patients could be treated with surgery alone. In
our adult cohort, all patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, so we are unable to comment on its efficacy.
However, the risk of relapse in the grade 3 patients was
not different between the adult and pediatric cohorts
(20% vs 21%, respectively), despite major differences in
management.
Our study has several limitations. It is a combined
database analysis of patients treated in multiple studies;
hence, there were missing data, and different staging systems were used. Although a small number of pediatric
patients and most adults were treated with chemotherapy,
there was no explicit documentation of objective
responses to chemotherapy. In addition, clinical details at
relapse were missing for adult patients; this included pathologic information and treatment at relapse. Despite these
limitations, several important clinical messages can be
drawn from our data.
236

In conclusion, our study shows that for all patients
with ovarian ITs, grade is the most important risk factor
for relapse. No patients with grade 1 tumors relapsed in
the pediatric or adult population. We would thus advocate that for grade 1 tumors, surgery alone should be recommended for all stages across all age groups. In patients
with higher grade tumors, the risk of relapse differed by
stage, and patients with stage I/II tumors had excellent
EFS in comparison with patients with stage III/IV
tumors. We currently have a joint COG-NRG clinical
trial under review that proposes observation for all stage I
tumors, regardless of grade. The results of this analysis
further justify this approach. With respect to the approach
for grade 2 and 3 tumors at higher stages, in our analyses,
we observed only a 2% failure rate for grade 2 tumors.
The only group for which the failure rate was a concern
was the group with grade 3, stage III/IV tumors. Adjuvant
chemotherapy did not decrease the relapse risk in the pediatric cohort. Given our doubts that this subtype of
GCT is chemosensitive, even in this higher stage and
grade group, we would be in favor of a prospective trial of
observation after surgery for patients with grade 2/3, stage
II-IV tumors with consideration of second surgery as the
first line of treatment in the setting of relapse.
