ABSTRACT
Chemo-resistance is a clinical barrier to more effective anti-cancer therapy. In
this context, cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are thought to be chemo-resistant, resulting
in tumor recurrence and distant metastasis. Our hypothesis is that chemo-resistance
in CSCs is driven, in part, by enhanced mitochondrial function. Here, we used breast
cell lines and metastatic breast cancer patient samples to begin to dissect the role
of mitochondrial metabolism in conferring the CSC phenotype. More specifically, we
employed fluorescent staining with MitoTracker (MT) to metabolically fractionate
these cell lines into mito-high and mito-low sub-populations, by flow-cytometry.
Interestingly, cells with high mitochondrial mass (mito-high) were specifically
enriched in a number of known CSC markers, such as aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) activity, and they were ESA+/CD24-/low and formed mammospheres with
higher efficiency. Large cell size is another independent characteristic of the stem
cell phenotype; here, we observed a >2-fold increase in mitochondrial mass in large
cells (>12-μm), relative to the smaller cell population (4–8-μm). Moreover, the mitohigh cell population showed a 2.4-fold enrichment in tumor-initiating cell activity,
based on limiting dilution assays in murine xenografts. Importantly, primary human
breast CSCs isolated from patients with metastatic breast cancer or a patient derived
xenograft (PDX) also showed the co-enrichment of ALDH activity and mitochondrial
mass. Most significantly, our investigations demonstrated that mito-high cells were
resistant to paclitaxel, resulting in little or no DNA damage, as measured using the
comet assay. In summary, increased mitochondrial mass in a sub-population of breast
cancer cells confers a stem-like phenotype and chemo-resistance. As such, our current
findings have important clinical implications for over-coming drug resistance, by
therapeutically targeting the mito-high CSC population.

i) energy metabolism and ii) susceptibility towards
apoptotic cell death. Previous studies have shown that
catabolic cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) produce
mitochondrial fuels (such as L-lactate, ketone bodies
and L-glutamine), which are sufficient to confer a drugresistant phenotype in MCF7 breast cancer cells in
culture [7, 8]. In this context, treatment with metformin
(a mitochondrial inhibitor of Complex I) was sufficient
to revert this drug-resistance phenotype. Similar results
were also obtained in a variety of distinct patient cohorts
followed at the MD Anderson and Dana-Farber Cancer
Centers, showing that increased mitochondrial integrity
(in stained tumor-tissue sections) was associated with
drug-resistance and treatment failure in a number of
different cancer types, including multiple myeloma,
acute myelogenous and lymphoblastic leukemia, as well
as ovarian cancers [9, 10].
Our group has previously shown that breast
CSCs are chemo- and radio-resistant and that stem
cell regulatory pathways, such as Notch, Wnt, FAK
and CXCR1/2, may play a role in their maintenance
and resistance mechanisms [11–17]. However, there
is a limited understanding of the metabolic activities
within CSC-enriched and CSC-depleted populations,
although mechanistic differences are undoubtedly
present [18–20]. Metabolic investigations in glioma stem
cells (GSCs) showed that radio-resistant GSCs were less
glycolytic, with a higher mitochondrial reserve capacity
[18], indicating that specific inhibition of OXPHOS may
target the GSCs. Similarly CSCs isolated from ovarian
cancer patients also showed evidence of a metabolic
profile dominated by OXPHOS, even in the absence of
glucose. The authors suggest that these findings could
be instrumental in helping CSCs to escape damage in
hypo-oxygenated tumor areas [21].
To determine if breast CSC characteristics were
associated with a specific metabolic activity, we used
MitoTracker (MT) as an investigational tool to livestain and metabolically fractionate cancer cell lines
and patient samples into mito-high and mito-low cell
populations. Our study demonstrates that cells with high
mitochondrial mass showed many of the characteristics
of CSCs, including increased ALDH activity,
mammosphere formation activity and tumor initiation
in vivo. In addition, we show increased survival and
decreased DNA damage within the mito-high cells after
paclitaxel treatment, suggesting that mitochondrial mass
confers a chemo-resistance phenotype, as predicted.
Thus, our current findings provide a new
mitochondrially-based model for understanding the
relationship between CSCs and chemo-resistance. As this
approach is technically simple, it could be used to rapidly
isolate chemo-resistant CSC populations from possibly
any tumor type, facilitating the development of new
classes of drugs to target chemo-resistance.

High mitochondrial mass directly correlates
with ALDH activity, the ESA+CD24-/low CSC
population and larger cell size
Studies show CSC and non-CSC populations
may use different metabolic pathways and this may
contribute to their increased survival and resistance
to chemotherapy [18, 22, 23]. To determine if
mitochondrial mass is increased within the CSC
population, we fluorescently-labeled mitochondria
in MCF7 and MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells with
MitoTracker Deep-Red. These cells were co-stained
with ALDEFLUOR or CSC cell surface markers ESA/
CD24, to identify the CSC population. Both ALDH+ and
ESA+/CD24- cell populations have been shown to be
enriched in mammosphere- and tumor-initiating cells,
key characteristics of CSCs [2, 24–28].
Figure 1A, 1B, 1C shows that MitoTracker staining
is specifically enriched in the ALDH+ cell population of
MCF7 and MDA MB 231 cells (P < 0.05). A similar fold
increase in MitoTracker mean fluorescence intensity was
also observed in the ESA+CD24-/low CSC population of
the MDA MB 231 cell line (Figure 1D, P < 0.01). These
findings suggest that CSCs contain a higher mitochondrial
mass than the non-CSC population.
As an alternative approach to enrich CSCs, we
used cell size. Previous studies have shown that cells
with mammary stem cell activity tend to be larger than
10 μm [29]. As a consequence, we used forward scatter
(FSC) to isolate three different cell populations, based
solely on size: 4–8 μm, 9–12  μm and >12 μm (Figure
2A). Quantitative analysis of MitoTracker staining
demonstrated that larger cells were associated with
significantly higher mitochondrial mass, up to 2.5-fold,
consistent with an anabolic CSC phenotype (Figure 2B
and 2C, P < 0.001).
These data indicate that high mitochondrial mass,
as determined by MitoTracker staining, is associated with
breast CSC populations enriched via three independent
CSC markers, namely ALDH activity, ESA/CD24 cell
surface levels or cell size.

High mitochondrial mass directly correlates with
ALDH activity in primary breast cancer cells
isolated from metastatic disease sites or a patient
derived xenograft (PDX)
To validate the possible in vivo relevance of our
above findings, we next examined mitochondrial mass in
primary CSC populations from metastatic breast cancer
patients. For this purpose, we co-labeled breast cancer
cells isolated directly from pleural effusions or ascites
fluids (n = 4) with ALDEFLUOR and MitoTracker.

Figure 3A, 3B, and 3D supports our breast cancer
cell line data, showing that ALDH+ primary metastatic
breast CSCs have significantly higher mitochondrial mass
than the ALDH- cells (P < 0.05). Notably, although these
findings are of a low sample size, our results appear to
be independent of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
(PR) and HER2 status (Figure 3F). In addition, we also
show similar results within the ALDH+ population of
human breast cancer cells isolated from a patient derived
xenograft (BB3RC50*) (Figure 3C and 3E). These data
suggest that high mitochondrial mass is associated with
CSC populations from freshly isolated metastatic breast
cancer cells.

staining) cell populations using flow-cytometry. The
mito-high and mito-low cell populations were then seeded
under non-adherent culture conditions and the number
of mammospheres >60 μm were counted after 5 days.
Both MCF7 and MDA MB 231 cells showed a significant
2- to -3 fold increase in mammosphere forming efficiency
within the mito-high population, compared to mito-low
cells (Figure 4A, P < 0.01).
The most stringent test of CSC activity is the
capacity for tumor initiation [31, 32]. Serial dilutions of
MDA MB 231 mito-high and mito-low cells (1, 5, 10,
and 50 cells) were injected into NOD scid gamma (NSG)
mice, and tumor initiation and growth were measured
over 9 weeks. Our results show high mitochondrial
mass was not associated with increased tumor growth/
size (Figure  4B). However, using extreme limiting
dilution analysis (ELDA), we demonstrate a 2.4-fold
increase in tumor initiation cell frequency within the
mito-high population of MDA MB 231 cells, when
compared to mito-low (Figure 4C, P < 0.05). Although
high mitochondrial mass was not associated with
increased tumor size (Figure 4B), these data show
that high mitochondrial mass is specifically associated
with two key functional CSC characteristics, in vitro
mammosphere formation and tumor-initiating cell
frequency in vivo.

High mitochondrial mass enriches for
mammosphere-forming activity in vitro
and tumor-initiating activity in vivo
Although we correlated high mitochondrial mass
with a number of CSC markers, it was important to validate
our findings with more functional parameters, such as
mammosphere-forming activity and tumor initiation,
that have been traditionally associated with “stemness”
[30–32]. MCF7 and MDA MD 231 cells were sorted into
mito-high (top 5% of cells with high MitoTracker staining)
and mito-low (bottom 5% of cells with low MitoTracker

CSCs with high mitochondrial mass
preferentially survive paclitaxel treatment and
show reduced DNA strand breaks, conferring
chemo-resistance

To better mechanistically understand this
chemo-resistance phenotype, we used the comet assay
to functionally measure the levels of DNA strand breaks
after 24 h of paclitaxel treatment [33]. Remarkably,
Figure 5C and 5D shows that cells with high mitochondrial
mass have significantly reduced DNA damage, whereas
cells with low mitochondrial mass are more chemosensitive, with increased comet tail length after paclitaxel
treatment. These data indicate that high mitochondrial
mass allows CSCs to survive chemotherapy, by affording
protection or increased repair against DNA damage.

Another key CSC characteristic is resistance to
radio- and chemo-therapy [2, 3, 17]. In order to correlate
chemo-resistance with mitochondrial mass, MCF7 and
MDA MB 231 cells were first separated into mito-high
and mito-low cell fractions by flow-cytometry, using
MitoTracker. The two cell populations were then seeded
into mammosphere culture in the presence or absence
of paclitaxel (0.1–0.5 μM) to assess their survival
characteristics and susceptibility towards DNA damage.
Figure 5A and 5B shows that cells with high
mitochondrial mass are resistant to paclitaxel,
demonstrating little or no decrease in mammosphere
formation, compared to vehicle alone controls. In contrast,
cells with low mitochondrial mass show significant
reductions in mammosphere formation, up to 2-fold, at the
same concentrations (P < 0.001). Thus, high mitochondrial
mass directly correlates with resistance to paclitaxel
in CSCs.

DISCUSSION
Drug resistance is a rate-limiting barrier to
successful cancer therapy. Tumor-initiating cells and/or
CSCs share a common chemo-resistant phenotype, which
ultimately drives tumor recurrence and metastatic disease,
resulting in patient relapse [1–6]. In this report, we show
that high mitochondrial mass is associated with CSC
markers, functional CSC characteristics (mammosphere
and tumor initiation) and chemo-resistance. Our findings
highlight the need to further understand and target the

metabolic pathways in CSCs, to improve clinical outcome
in breast cancer patients.
ALDEFLUOR is an investigational tool, which is
routinely used to measure ALDH activity in cell lines
and primary tumor samples, enriching for CSC activity
via flow-cytometry [27, 28]. However, the ALDH gene
family is quite large and it still remains controversial
which ALDH isoforms contribute towards ALDH activity
that is associated with CSC activity [34–37]. As our
current report shows that ALDH activity in CSCs is also
associated with high levels of mitochondrial mass, in cell
lines and patient samples, it is quite possible that this stemcell associated ALDH activity may also be derived from
mitochondria. In fact, at least 7 members of the ALDH
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

family of genes are known to be targeted to mitochondria
and are bonafide resident mitochondrial proteins,
including ALDH2, ALDH1L2, ALDH4A1, ALDH5A1,
ALDH6A1, ALDH7A1 and ALDH18A1. Therefore, this
new mitochondrial connection could functionally explain
the relationship between ALDH activity and stemness in
cancer cells. In support of this idea, it was recently shown
that the drug-resistant ALDH-high cell sub-population has
significantly increased mitochondrial respiration, leading
to increased levels of oxidative stress [38].
We also showed that other CSC markers (ESA/
CD24), and large cell size were associated with high
mitochondrial mass. This supports other published studies
where breast CSCs have been shown to have a higher

proton leak, compared to their differentiated non-CSC
progeny [22]. Moreover, we demonstrated that cells
with high mitochondrial mass were also functionally
more stem-like, showing significant increases in
i)  mammosphere-forming efficiency and ii) tumorinitiating cell activity in vivo. The mechanism behind
the increased mitochondrial mass in our study remains
unknown. However, CSC populations are known to have
a distinct genomic and proteomic expression profile [39],
which can contribute to the stem cell characteristics of
CSCs. This differential expression may also influence
mitochondrial biogenesis, for example high levels of
mTORC1 and its activity are seen in CSC populations
of pancreatic and breast cancer cells [40, 41]. Studies
have shown mitochondrial activity and biogenesis are
controlled by mTORC1 by promotion of the translation
of mitochondria-related mRNAs, via inhibition of the
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)binding proteins [42], suggesting the high activity of
mTORC1 in CSCs may increase mitochondrial biogenesis.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Similarly, the transcription coactivator peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha
(PGC-1α), a known mediator of mitochondrial biogenesis,
has been shown to be overexpressed in circulating tumor
cells (with CSC characteristics) from the MMTV-PyMT
spontaneous mouse breast cancer model [43]. The overexpression of oncogenes is also linked to increased
mitochonidrial mass. Increased expression of Myc
maintained the stemness of brain stem cells and glioma
CSCs [44, 45] but also stimulated nuclear-encoded
mitochondrial genes and mitochondrial biogenesis
[46]. These studies suggest the differential expression
of proteins and genes within the CSC population may
preferentially favor increased mitochondrial biogenesis,
compared to the non-CSC population.
The inherent expression of genes that increase
mitochondrial biogenesis may, in turn, aid the maintenance
of stem cell characteristics, as mitochondrial function
has been shown to be important for the self renewal
and differentiation capacity of stem cells. Although
mitochondrial mass in embryonic stem cells is low,

studies in normal adult stem cells and CSCs demonstrate
the levels of mitochondrial mass are tissue-specific [47].
In glioblastoma, the depletion of mitochondrial DNA,
after 2′-3′-dideoxycytidine treatment, inhibited tumor
initiation [48], whereas reduced mitochondrial mass
identified lung cancer stem cells [49]. A recent paper
also highlighted the asymmetric apportioning of old/aged
mitochondria, where the retention of young mitochondria
during asymmetric self-renewal was vital to maintaining
the stem cell characteristics of normal mammary epithelial
cells [50]. Our data suggests that increased mitochondrial
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mass may increase tumor initiation via increased self
renewal. Further investigations on the tumor initiation
capacity of breast CSCs after the depletion or inactivation
of mitochondria are warranted to validate this hypothesis.
Although high mitochondrial mass increased
tumor initiation, especially at low cell numbers, it did
not significantly affect overall tumor growth/size. These
findings may simply reflect the recent observation that
tumor cells have the capacity to “steal” mitochondrial
DNA (mt-DNA) from host stromal cells (such as
mesenchymal stem cells or endothelial cells), to boost

Figure 6: Therapeutic targeting of chemo-resistant CSCs: A new systematic approach. Here, we propose a new clinical

strategy for over-coming drug resistance. We suggest that primary or metastatic clinical samples could be used to purify chemo-resistant
“mito-high” CSCs by flow-cytometry, after live-staining with MitoTracker, to estimate mitochondrial mass. Then, these chemoresistant CSCs would be subjected to phenotypic drug screening, with well-defined panels of i) conventional chemotherapies and/or ii)
mitochondrially-targeted FDA-approved drugs (e.g., metformin and antibiotics). This would allow us to achieve the goals of personalized
cancer treatment, by establishing the chemo-sensitivity profiles of mito-high CSCs in individual patients, leading to the prevention of tumor
recurrence and metastasis, in multiple cancer types. Chemo-resistant “mito-high” CSCs could also be expanded by using 3D-spheroid
cultures, possibly for biobanking and drug screening.

requires cell division to induce microtubule damage.
Further exploration to elucidate the exact mechanisms is
warranted.
CSCs are known to have increased DNA damage
responses and repair mechanisms, characterized by
the expression of high levels of DNA repair proteins,
e.g. Chk1 and Rad51 [58, 59]. Since our mito-high cell
population is enriched in established CSC markers, it is
reasonable to presume the reduced DNA damage may
be facilitated in part via non-metabolic mechanisms.
However, recent studies have described signaling linking
the metabolite fumarate to the promotion of DNA repair.
Increased fumarate inhibited KDM2B histone demethylase
activity, which subsequently increased accumulation of
DNA-PK at double strand break regions, driving nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair and cell survival
[60, 61]. Research to date has only just started to reveal
the complex signaling cross-talk linking metabolic
processes with the DNA damage response and other
biological functions. Further investigations will aid our
understanding and deliver new targets to improve cancer
treatment.
Interestingly, most markers of stemness that
are routinely used to enrich for CSC activity (CD24,

their metabolic capacity towards OXPHOS, depending on
the length of time they spend in the host [51]. Interestingly,
it has also been reported that the transfer of stromal cell
mitochondria to cancer cells increases their respiratory
capacity and chemo-resistance [52].
Our findings also demonstrated that cells with
high mitochondrial mass were resistant to chemotherapy,
effectively protecting, delaying or avoiding DNA strand
breaks after 24 h of paclitaxel treatment. Other studies
show that inhibiting ALDH activity, which is increased
within the mito-high population, can increase chemosensitivity [53, 54], although the specific mechanism is
currently unknown. Evidence also shows that chemoresistant solid cancers could be driven by numerous
metabolic mechanisms, including reduced reactive oxygen
species [55] and increased mitochondrial coupling [56].
Similarly, a recent study has identified that SIRT4, a
mitochondria-localized sirtuin, regulates the metabolic
responses to DNA damage by repressing mitochondrial
glutamine metabolism. This contributes to the control of
cell cycle progression and the maintenance of genomic
integrity in response to DNA damage [57]. Differential
metabolic control of the cell cycle may therefore play a
role in reducing DNA damage in our study, as paclitaxel

sensitivity to chemotherapy and aiding in the discovery
of new therapeutics that inhibit mitochondrial biogenesis
in CSCs.
In summary, metabolic fractionation of cancer
cell lines and primary metastatic breast cancer samples,
identified a stem-like, mitochondrial-rich sub-population
of tumor cells (Figure 7). CSCs with high mitochondrial
mass showed an increased capacity for mammosphere
formation, tumor initiation and were resistant to DNAdamage induced by paclitaxel. Thus, these results provide
a new mitochondrially-based model for understanding
the molecular relationship between CSCs and chemoresistance.

ESA, CD133, KRT19) are not generally thought of
as therapeutically druggable targets. In contrast, the
discovery of mitochondrial mass as a biomarker of CSC
activity, as detected using the MitoTracker probe, suggests
that we could therapeutically target mitochondria to
more effectively eradicate the CSC population. There
are many potential targets within mitochondria that
could be inhibited to improve cancer treatment. These
include targeting mitochondrial control of apoptosis with
inhibitors the BCL-2 family [62] or HSP90, which has
been shown to be specifically expressed in cancer cell
mitochondria, but not their normal counterparts [63, 64].
Specific targeting of upregulated metabolic pathways, such
as fatty acid synthesis, glycolysis and OXPHOS have also
been shown to have anti-cancer effects (reviewed in Ref
[65]). As discussed above, mitochondrial biogenesis can
be induced by the hyper-activation of numerous signaling
pathways and oncogenes, such as mTOR and Myc, which
can be inhibited using rapacycin analogues e.g. everolimus
[66] or DCR-MYC, a novel siRNA-based therapeutic,
designed to silence the MYC oncogene which is currently
in Phase I clinical trials [67].
The “Endo-symbiotic Theory of Mitochondrial
Evolution” suggests that mitochondria originally
evolved from engulfed aerobic bacteria, over millions
of years of adaptation [68, 69]. As such, antibiotics
target mitochondria, and therefore this side effect could
be exploited to target the increased mitochondrial mass
within CSCs. Interestingly, several FDA-approved drugs/
antibiotics that target mitochondria have already been
shown to eradicate CSC activity, such as OXPHOS
inhibitors (metformin and pyrvinium pamoate) [70–73],
a potassium ionophore (salinomycin) [74, 75] and known
inhibitors of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial
translation (the erythromycins, the tetracyclines and
the glycylcyclines) [76, 77]. In fact, doxycycline and
azithromycin have already shown significant efficacy in
treatment-resistant cancer patients, with MALT lymphoma
and non-small cell lung tumors, respectively [78–80].
The discovery that MitoTracker can identify a live
population of cancer cells (mito-high) that are enriched
for chemo-resistant cells may have a potential role in
personalized medicine. For example the isolation of mitohigh cells from patient samples could be used to screen
for sensitivity to current or new therapies, by measuring
cell death, mammosphere formation, or by employing
a simple colony survival assay (Figure 6). Mito-high
cells could also be isolated for genomic and proteomic
analyses. Detailed analysis of the transcriptome and the
proteome of mito-high cells, as compared to the mito-low
cell populations, could reveal specific pathways that mitohigh cells depend on for survival and maintenance. These
specific pathways could then be targeted, to eliminate
this chemo-resistant cell population. With further
development, our new findings could have important
clinical relevance for targeting CSCs, by improving

5 × 105 cells were re-suspended in 1 ml Assay buffer
and 5 μl ALDEFLUOR reagent (Stem Cell Technologies)
was added and mixed well. 0.5 ml of this cell suspension
was transferred into a new tube with 5 μl of DEAB regent
(Stem Cell Technologies). Tubes were incubated for
30 mins at 37°C before centrifugation and re-suspension
in Assay Buffer (0.5 ml) for FACS analysis (BD, LSR
Fortessa). When combined with MitoTracker Deep-Red
(Molecular Probes, 0.125 μl/ml), both were added before
30 min incubation. Note the PDX model BB6RC50 was
also co-stained with anti-mouse MHC Class I (H-2Kd)
antibody conjugated with Pacific Blue (BioLegend,
116616), to exclude mouse cells in the ALDH analysis.

Figure 7: Understanding the relationship between mitochondrial mass, “stemness” and chemo-resistance in cancer
cells. Our report suggests that high mitochondrial mass, quantified using live MitoTracker staining, is associated with a number of stem
cell characteristics and biological functions including CSC markers ALDH+, ESA/CD24, large cell size, mammosphere formation in vitro,
as well as tumor-initiating activity in vivo. Moreover, cells with high mitochondrial mass were preferentially resistant to paclitaxel during
mammosphere formation and the comet assay (a marker DNA damage), when compared to low mitochondrial mass cells. Thus, we conclude
that high mitochondrial mass can be used as a biomarker to isolate a sub-population of stem-like cancer cells that are chemo-resistant. This
has important implications for better appreciating the role of tumor metabolic heterogeneity in driving chemo-resistance and treatment
failure, via recurrence and metastasis.

Comet assay

Deep-Red (Molecular Probes) was added for 30 mins
at 37°C before centrifugation and re-suspension in PBS
for FACS analysis (BD, LSR Fortessa) or Sorting (BD,
Aria III).

Alkaline comet assays were modified from [33].
MDA MB 231 and MCF7 cells were FACS sorted for
the 5% highest and lowest MitoTracker expressing cells.
Cells were seeded into 24 well plates (2 × 104 cells) and
treated with 0.1 μM paclitaxel for 24 h. Cell were them
trypsinized and resuspended into 250 μl cell media; 750 μl
of low melting point agarose (1% w/v in PBS, at 40°C)
was added to the cell suspensions before pipetting on to a
pre-agarose coated glass slide and a glass cover slip was
placed on top. After 15 min at 4°C, slides were placed
in lysis buffer (2.5 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris,
10% DMSO, 1% Triton X-100, pH 10) and left at 4°C
overnight. Slides were placed in alkaline solution (0.3 M
NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, pH13) for 50 mins at 4°C and
electrophoresed at 23 V for 50 mins (4°C). SYBRgold

CSC cell surface markers
Exponentially dividing MDA MB 231 cells were
trypsinized and re-suspended into a 1 × 106 cell/100 μl
PBS. MitoTracker (0.125 μl/ml) was added to cell
suspension for 30 mins at 37°C before centrifugation
and re-suspension in 100 μl PBS and the addition of
10 μl ESA-FITC (DAKO, BerEP4), 10 μl CD24-PE
(Pharmingen) for 10 mins at 4°C before centrifugation
and re-suspension in PBS for FACS analysis (BD, LSR
Fortessa. All tubes were incubated with 1 μl/ml live/dead
fixable violet cell stain (Molecular Probes) to exclude dead
cells from FACS analysis and sorting.

Isolation of breast cancer cells from primary
samples and patient derived xenografts

Statistical analysis
In vitro data is represented as the mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM), taken over ≥3 independent
experiments, with ≥3 technical replicates per experiment,
unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance was
measured using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test
with post-hoc dunetts multiple comparisons or t-test,
using Graphpad prism. P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant
and all statistical tests were two-sided. All statistics were
carried out under the guidance of the Medical Statistics
Department, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, UK.

Breast cancer cells were isolated from pleural
effusions or ascites fluid from metastatic breast cancer
patients (n = 4), using the following method. The acquired
samples were centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min at 1000 × g,
followed by resuspension in cold PBS. Red blood cells
were removed using Lymphoprep™ (Axis-Shield) and
subsequently leukocytes were removed with CD45negative magnetic sorting (Miltenyi Biotech), according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Metastatic human
breast cancer samples were collected from patients at The
Christie NHS Foundation Trust. All patients underwent
fully informed consent, in accordance with local
research ethics committee guidelines (05/Q1403/159 and
05/Q1402/25). The PDX model BB6RC50 was generated
from the subcutaneous injection of 1 million metastatic
breast cancer cells into NOD scid gamma mice. Passage 2
tumors were removed, dissected into 2–3-mm cubed
pieces and then digested for 1–2 hours at 37°C in serumfree Dulbecco’s modified Eagle Medium (DMEM;Gibco)
containing × 1 collagenase/hyaluronidase (STEMCELL
technologies) and penicillin (100 U/mL) – streptomycin
(0.1 mg/mL; Sigma). The enzymatically digested tumor
was then filtered through a sterile 40-μm mesh/sieve, to
obtain a single-cell suspension and washed in cold PBS.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Mammosphere culture of breast cancer cells

None.

Mammospheres were cultured as described [30]. In
brief, single cells from MCF7 and MDA MD 231 cell lines
or primary metastatic samples were seeded at 500 cells per
cm2 on poly-HEMA-coated plates. Mammosphere forming
efficiency (MFE) was calculated as follows: [(number of
mammospheres formed (≥60 μm) ÷ by the number of cells
seeded) × 100].

Tumor initiation and Extreme limiting
dilution assay (ELDA)
MDA MB 231 cells were stained with MitoTracker
and sorted into two populations; mito-low (lowest
5% mitochondrial mass) and mito-high (highest 5%
mitochondrial mass). Cells were then resuspended in
1:1 solution of mammosphere media and growth factor
reduced matrigel. NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice were
then subcutaneously injected with 1, 5, 10 and 50 cells per
flank (n = 3 mice per group) of mito-low and mito-high
MDA MB 231 cells. Tumor size was measured bi-weekly
