ABSTRACT
A key task in developing the field of personalized cancer therapy is the
identification of novel molecular targets that enable treatment of cancers not
susceptible to other means of specific therapy. The collagen receptor uPARAP/
Endo180 is overexpressed by malignant cells in several non-epithelial cancers,
notably including sarcomas, glioblastomas and subsets of acute myeloid leukemia.
In contrast, in healthy adult individuals, expression is restricted to minor subsets of
mesenchymal cells. Functionally, uPARAP/Endo180 is a rapidly recycling endocytic
receptor that delivers its cargo directly into the endosomal-lysosomal system, thus
opening a potential route of entry into receptor-positive cells. This combination
of specific expression and endocytic function appears well suited for targeting of
uPARAP/Endo180-positive cancers by antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) mediated drug
delivery. Therefore, we utilized a specific monoclonal antibody against uPARAP/
Endo180, raised through immunization of a uPARAP/Endo180 knock-out mouse,
which reacts with both the human and the murine receptor, to construct a uPARAPdirected ADC. This antibody was coupled to the highly toxic dolastatin derivative,
monomethyl auristatin E, via a cathepsin-labile valine-citrulline linker. With this ADC,
we show strong and receptor-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro in uPARAP/Endo180positive cancer cell lines of sarcoma, glioblastoma and leukemic origin. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the potency of the ADC in vivo in a xenograft mouse model with
human uPARAP/Endo180-positive leukemic cells, obtaining a complete cure of all
tested mice following intravenous ADC treatment with no sign of adverse effects. Our
study identifies uPARAP/Endo180 as a promising target for novel therapy against
several highly malignant cancer types.

INTRODUCTION

lysosomal compartment liberates the toxin for entry into
the cytoplasm.
In this work, we have constructed and characterized
an ADC directed against uPARAP, based on a
specific monoclonal antibody in combination with the
aforementioned linker-toxin structure. We show that this
ADC has strong and target receptor dependent cytotoxicity
in vitro in a panel of cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we
demonstrate a high anti-tumor efficiency in vivo in a
uPARAP-positive tumor model, obtaining a complete cure
in all mice treated with this ADC.  

In many cancer types, notably including several
non-epithelial cancers, there is a strong need for
novel tumor cell-specific therapy. In these cases, the
identification and validation of novel cell surface markers
which may act as tumor-specific targets is a crucial task.
The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor–associated
protein (uPARAP, the product of the MRC2 gene, and
also known as Endo180 or CD280) is a specialized
component in tissue collagen turnover. This protein, in
the following designated uPARAP, acts as an endocytic
receptor internalizing extracellular matrix collagen for
lysosomal degradation [1–6]. uPARAP has a limited
distribution in healthy tissues where it is expressed on a
restricted set of cells of mesenchymal origin, including
subsets of activated fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes
involved in bone development [2, 7–10]. In contrast, high
expression levels of uPARAP are found on malignant cells
of various non-epithelial cancers, including osteosarcomas
and soft tissue sarcomas [11, 12], glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) [13, 14] and subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) (http://servers.binf.ku.dk/bloodspot/, see ref. [15]).
In the context of molecular cancer targeting, this is an
interesting expression pattern. There is an urgent need for
improved means of treatment for all of these cancer types,
including a demand for novel strategies for specific tumor
cell-directed therapy [16–18].
One successful strategy for targeting of cancer cells
through tumor-specific cell surface markers is the use of
antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). This strategy combines
the ability of an antibody to specifically recognize the
target cell with the effect of an attached drug or cytotoxin,
thus allowing targeted drug delivery with minimal sideeffects [19–22]. In addition to the strong expression by
non-epithelial cancers, uPARAP has functional properties
that might particularly favor an ADC-mediated strategy
targeting this receptor. Thus, the receptor takes part in
efficient ligand internalization in a rapid process, where
the receptor recycles to the cell surface with a frequency
of several cycles per hour, whereas the initially bound
cargo is routed to lysosomal degradation [10, 23].
When targeting such cellular receptors, ADC
constructs rely on mechanisms for intralysosomal
release of the conjugated cytotoxin from the antibody
component, before translocation into the cytoplasm can
be efficiently achieved. Furthermore, the limited number
of molecular delivery events into each cell dictates the use
of extremely potent cytotoxins in these ADC constructs
[19]. One commonly employed mechanism of action
is based on a highly potent cytotoxin, monomethyl
auristatin E (MMAE), a synthetic derivative of the tubulin
inhibitor dolastatin 10a [19, 24, 25], which is coupled to
an IgG component through a valine-citrulline dipeptidecontaining linker entity [26–28]. With this construct,

RESULTS
Demonstration of uPARAP-expression in cell
lines from various cancers and target-specific
endocytosis of antibody 2h9 against uPARAP
Since uPARAP has been reported to be expressed
by tumor cells in AML, sarcomas and GBM [11–15], we
first verified that a panel of cultured cell lines derived from
these diseases express the receptor. The U937 myeloid
leukemia, the NB-4 acute promyelocytic leukemia, the
THP-1 monocytic leukemia, the HT1080 fibrosarcoma,
the GCT (giant cell tumor) fibrous histiocytoma, the RD
rhabdomyosarcoma, the KNS42 glioblastoma, the HS683
glioblastoma and U373 MG glioblastoma cell lines
were all found to express uPARAP by Western blotting
(Figure 1A). For comparison, we also included a U937
uPARAP knockout cell line rendered uPARAP negative
by CRISPR/Cas9 technology (see Methods), as well as
the non-malignant, embryonic cell line HEK293, which
previously has been shown to have negligible expression
of uPARAP [29, 30], and under the same conditions of
Western blotting showed a signal close to background
(Figure 1A).
As a candidate antibody to be used in ADC form, we
focused on a well-defined anti-uPARAP mAb, designated
2.h.9:F12 (henceforth 2h9). This high-affinity antibody
was previously raised in the laboratory after immunization
of a uPARAP knock-out mouse and has been extensively
characterized, including the demonstration of specific
reaction with both the human and the murine receptor
[29, 30].
To show that mAb 2h9 can accumulate specifically
in uPARAP-positive cells, we labeled the antibody
with an Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647) fluorophore. For
fluorescence labeling, we used a coupling method
based on mild reduction of IgG disulphides followed
by maleimide conjugation, thus mimicking a preferred
molecular strategy for preparing an ADC (see Methods).
As a negative control, we labeled an isotype-matched
murine mAb, anti-trinitrophenol (aTNP), which has no
biological recognition partners in human cells [31]. We
then incubated U937 cells with these fluorescence-labeled
antibodies, subjected the cells to protease treatment to

remove surface-bound fluorescence, and studied the
cells by confocal microscopy. When incubated with 2h9AF647, the cells displayed a pronounced intracellular
fluorescence with a strong vesicular signal (Figure 1B).
This staining pattern was equivalent to previously obtained
results using fluorescence-labeled collagen ligands after
specific uptake in uPARAP-positive cells, where these

ligands have been shown to be routed to lysosomes [1–5].
No uptake was observed with the negative control, aTNPAF647. These data suggested that mAb 2h9 could be
modified by a reduction/maleimide-dependent conjugation
procedure and thereby coupled to a low-molecular weight
hydrophobic moiety, while still being subject to specific
endocytosis by the target receptor.

Figure 1: Expression of uPARAP by different cancer cell lines and specific cellular uptake of fluorescence-labeled
mAb 2h9. (A), whole cell lysates of the cancer cell lines U937, THP-1, NB-4, HT1080, GCT, RD, KNS42, HS683 and U373 MG were
examined for expression of uPARAP by Western blot, together with lysates of uPARAP-deficient U937 cells obtained by CRISPR/Cas9
technology (“U937 uPARAP k.o.”; see Methods) and non-malignant HEK293 cells. uPARAP was detected using anti-uPARAP mAb 2h9
as the primary antibody. Bands of apparent Mr 180,000 confirm expression of uPARAP in all of the cancer cell lines except for U937
uPARAP k.o. Negligible expression of uPARAP is observed in HEK293 cells. An antibody against GAPDH (Mr 37,000) was used as a
loading control. Asterisk: The THP-1 cell line displayed a reduced GAPDH signal, although identical loading of total protein was used;

microscopy. Blue: nuclear (Hoechst) stain; green: plasma membrane (anti-hCD45-AlexaFluor 488) stain; red: AlexaFluor 647-labeled

Preparation and evaluation of a uPARAPdirected ADC

both heavy and light chains. To study the sensitivity of the
conjugate to proteolytic release of the toxin, we incubated
a sample of 2h9-vc-MMAE (DAR~4) with recombinant
cathepsin B. This led to a reversion of the electrophoretic
mobility back to that of unconjugated mAb, indicative
of valine-citrulline dependent linker cleavage by the
lysosomal protease (Figure 3B).
To establish that mAb 2h9 retained affinity towards
uPARAP after the preparation of the ADC, we studied
the binding of the products to uPARAP in an ELISA
setup, using dilution series of either unmodified mAbs,
mAbs subjected to the reduction step of the conjugation
procedure, or mAb-vc-MMAE ADCs. Reassuringly, both
the disulphide-reduced mAb 2h9 and the 2h9-vc-MMAE
ADC displayed a concentration dependent binding
nearly identical with that of the unmodified mAb (Figure
3C). Since the binding curves obtained include the subnanomolar concentration range, this result points to an
unchanged or negligible loss of affinity towards uPARAP,
and confirms that mAb 2h9 tolerates the conjugation
procedure with the linker-toxin construct well.

To create an ADC based on mAb 2h9, we coupled
the antibody to MMAE via a cathepsin-sensitive linker
(see Introduction), using partial reduction of IgG
disulphides and maleimide chemistry, forming an ADC
designated 2h9-vc-MMAE. An equivalent product was
created with the control antibody, aTNP. A schematic view
of the resulting mAb-vc-MMAE ADC structure is shown
in Figure 2. The molecular drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR)
was determined using an absorbance-based method (see
Methods), and it was verified that for both of these mAbs,
the DAR could be controlled by adjusting the amount of
maleimide-derivatized linker-toxin reagent present during
conjugation, with a maximal obtainable DAR of 10 [32]
(see Methods). This DAR corresponds to labeling of all
free thiol groups formed from five reduced interchain
disulphides in a murine IgG1 molecule
Batches of 2h9-vc-MMAE with moderate (~4) or
high (~10) DAR were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE
and compared with unmodified mAb 2h9. As shown in
Figure 3A, the ADCs have decreased gel mobility relative
to the unmodified mAbs and this effect becomes more
pronounced at a high DAR. The ADC with a moderate
DAR appeared to be mainly conjugated via heavy chain
cysteines, evident from the lack of mobility shift of the
IgG light chain in the DAR~4 batch. In contrast, the ADC
with a high DAR of 10 appeared to be conjugated via

In order to evaluate the cytotoxic potential
of uPARAP-directed ADC 2h9-vc-MMAE, cells
demonstrated above to be positive or negative for uPARAP
expression were incubated with a dilution series of either

2h9-vc-MMAE or control ADC aTNP-vc-MMAE for
72 hours, and thereafter analyzed for cytotoxicity of
the ADCs by a cell viability assay (Figure 4). All of the
uPARAP-positive cell lines showed specific sensitivity
towards 2h9-vc-MMAE, with leukemia cell lines U937
and NB-4 displaying the most pronounced loss of
viability. A smaller, nonspecific effect of the negative
control conjugate was noted at the highest concentrations
(> 2.5 µg/mL mAb component) in some cell lines, but
importantly still leaving a large therapeutic window of
specificity for 2h9-vc-MMAE. HEK293 cells, as well as
the aforementioned U937 uPARAP knock-out clone (see
Figure 1A and Methods), were irresponsive towards 2h9vc-MMAE, thus demonstrating that the cytotoxic effect of
this ADC is target receptor specific.
To further substantiate the specificity of the cytotoxic
effect, a competition assay was performed. U937 cells were
incubated with 2h9-vc-MMAE at 1 µg/mL mAb component
in the presence of increasing amounts of potential
competitors. The latter reagents included unmodified mAb
2h9, a mAb designated 5f4 which recognizes a different
epitope on uPARAP [30], and the negative control mAb,

aTNP. The uncoupled mAb 2h9 had pronounced efficacy in
rescuing cells from 2h9-vc-MMAE mediated cytotoxicity,
whereas no effect was found with the other antibodies
(Figure 5A). The mAb 5f4 has been studied extensively
previously, and has been shown to deplete uPARAP from
the cell surface upon long-term incubation, due to failure
of receptor recycling [33]. Therefore, we also studied
the effect of this antibody in a preincubation experiment,
where mAb 5f4 was added before the addition of 2h9-vcMMAE. Indeed, preincubating U937 cells with mAb 5f4
for 3 hours resulted in a ~10 fold decrease in the toxicity of
subsequently added 2h9-vc-MMAE (Figure 5B).
Next, to study whether the cytotoxicity of 2h9-vcMMAE was dependent on lysosomal linker cleavage, we
tested the effect of E-64D, an inhibitor capable of entering
the lysosomal compartment and blocking the activity of
several lysosomal cysteine proteases including cathepsin
B [34]. U937 cells were preincubated with E-64D, after
which the cellular sensitivity was determined by adding a
dilution series of the ADCs. As shown in Figure 5C, this
pretreatment abrogated the cytotoxic effect of 2h9-vcMMAE.

Altogether, these experiments showed that the
cytotoxic effect of 2h9-vc-MMAE is dependent on the
interaction between the targeting antibody and the target
receptor, as well as lysosomal cleavage of the valinecitrulline-containing ADC linker.
MMAE is an extremely potent inhibitor of tubulin
polymerization and is highly cytotoxic, being directed
particularly against actively dividing cells. However, the
compound may not always mediate cell killing directly,
as affected cells may instead be arrested in the G2/M cell
cycle phase due to failure of mitotic spindle assembly
[19]. Therefore, in order to investigate the mechanism
underlying the observed reduction in overall viability of
the cells, we determined the cell cycle distribution of the
sensitive cell lines shown above, following incubation
with 2h9-vc-MMAE at a concentration resulting in a 50%
reduction in viability, as demonstrated in Figure 4. In these
experiments, shown in Table 1, all leukemia cell lines
(U937, NB-4 and THP-1) displayed a clear propensity
towards apoptosis over growth arrest upon exposure to
2h9-vc-MMAE, evident from the increase in percentage
of cells mainly in the sub-G1 cell cycle phase. Similar data
was found for the sarcoma cell line HT1080, whereas the
GCT cell line showed an increase mainly in the fraction
of cells in the G2/M phase. The RD sarcoma cell line, as
well as GBM cell lines KNS42, HS683 and U373 MG,
showed a mixed response, with increased fractions of cells
both in the sub-G1 phase and the G2/M phase, indicative
of effects resulting in apoptosis as well as growth arrest.

Thus, these data demonstrate composite mechanisms of
inhibition of cancer cell growth in the cell lines tested.
This opens the possibility that both a direct cytotoxicity
and a non-lethal inhibition of cell division by the cytotoxin
MMAE may contribute to counteracting tumor growth in
certain cancer forms.

Eradication of uPARAP-positive tumors in mice
The sensitivity of the U937 cell line towards ADC
2h9-vc-MMAE in vitro appeared highly promising for
in vivo investigation, since AML models in mice based
on this cell line are well established [35–38], and since
uPARAP is strongly upregulated in certain AML subsets
in humans [15]. In contrast, normal leukocytes in the
circulation are generally uPARAP-negative [6]. Therefore,
in order to investigate a potential anti-tumor effect of 2h9vc-MMAE in vivo, we next set up a xenograft model with
U937 cells, using subcutaneous inoculation of cells in
CB17 SCID mice [35, 36].
In this system, the growth of the resulting tumors
can be easily evaluated by palpation. In the absence of
treatment, subcutaneous injection with U937 cells led
to the establishment of local tumors within approx. two
weeks, with a doubling time of tumor volume of 3 to 4 days
(see Methods; data not shown). Immunohistochemical
staining of these tumors revealed a positive staining
for uPARAP in tumor cells. uPARAP staining was
predominantly observed in the outermost part of the tumor

Figure 5: Specificity of the cytotoxic effect of 2h9-vc-MMAE, and importance of cathepsin-mediated linker cleavage.

MTS-based cell viability assays were performed as in Figure 4, except that additional reagents were added as indicated. (A), receptor
competition assay with unmodified mAbs. Viability curves obtained upon incubation of U937 cells with 1 µg/mL of 2h9-vc-MMAE
in the simultaneous presence of increasing amounts of potential competitor mAbs, using either mAb 2h9 (red), mAb aTNP (grey) or
a different uPARAP-directed mAb (5f4; blue). Only mAb 2h9 rescues the cells from 2h9-vc-MMAE mediated toxicity. (B), effect of
target receptor depletion on ADC toxicity. Viability curves of U937 cells obtained with a concentration series of 2h9-vc-MMAE, either
without pretreatment of cells (red), following a 3 hour preincubation with uPARAP-depleting mAb 5f4 (green; see text), or obtained with a
concentration series of ADC aTNP-vc-MMAE (grey). Preincubation with mAb 5f4 decreases the impact of 2h9-vc-MMAE on cell viability
approximately 10-fold. (C), inhibition of lysosomal ADC linker cleavage and drug release. Viability curves of U937 cells obtained in the
presence of ADCs 2h9-vc-MMAE (red), aTNP-vc-MMAE (grey), or 2h9-vc-MMAE following preincubation of cells with 20 µM of an
inhibitor of lysosomal proteases (E-64D, purple). Incubation in the presence of E-64D abrogates the toxic effect of 2h9-vc-MMAE.

The cell cycle phase distribution of cancer cell lines, comparing untreated cells to cells following incubation with 2h9-vcMMAE over three days. The ADC was added at a final concentration resulting in 50% overall cell viability, as previously
determined by viability assay (see Figure 4). Bold numbers marked with an asterisk indicate a significant shift in the

tissue (Figure 6A), which was also the case after positive
control staining for human CD45 (Figure 6B), confirming
the human origin of the stained cells. Thus, tumor cells
retained uPARAP expression when growing in vivo. Ki67 staining of the tumor tissue revealed a high proportion
of actively proliferating cells (Figure 6C), as expected
considering the rapid tumor growth observed by palpation.
Staining for apoptosis showed very little positive signal in
the tumor tissue, demonstrating a very low abundance of
apoptotic cells (Figure 6D). Evaluation of H&E stained
tumor tissue indicated that tumors are densely packed with
cancer cells (small round cells), with a relatively small
contribution of stromal cells with a typical elongated
fibroblast morphology (black arrows). In addition, staining
confirmed intact nuclei of the far majority of cells present,
with no obvious signs of necrosis (Figure 6E)
To initially test animal tolerance towards the ADCs
in the absence of tumors, a subcutaneous injection of a
single high dose (15 mg/kg) of either 2h9-vc-MMAE
(N=2) or aTNP-vc-MMAE (N=2) at a moderate DAR of
~4 was performed. Animals were then closely monitored
for signs of distress or aberrant behavior and weighed
daily for a 7-day period. No weight loss or signs of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

abnormal behavior was observed, thus demonstrating
gross tolerance towards these ADCs.
We then tested the effect of local ADC treatment
in tumor-bearing mice. Randomized groups of mice were
treated with either uPARAP-directed ADC 2h9-vc-MMAE,
control ADC aTNP-vc-MMAE, unmodified mAb 2h9, or
PBS vehicle control, respectively. Treatment was initiated
after the establishment of palpable tumors of 50-100 mm3,
with each mouse receiving 4 subcutaneous doses of 3 mg/kg
mAb component in the tumor area, with four-day intervals.
Tumors in mice receiving aTNP-vc-MMAE or unmodified
mAb 2h9 showed unaffected tumor growth relative to the
PBS vehicle control group, and all mice in these groups
reached a point of sacrifice due to tumor size after 9-12
days of treatment. In contrast, the group of mice treated
with 2h9-vc-MMAE showed a strong reduction in tumor
growth (Figure 7A). Indeed, after completion of treatment,
9 out of 10 mice in this group had reached a point where no
palpable tumors could be detected. These mice were then
followed for an observation period of 3 months without
further treatment. As shown in the Kaplan-Meyer plot
(Figure 7B), a full cure was obtained in 5 of these animals,
with no signs of relapse throughout this observation period.

Notably, these surviving mice did not show any signs of
detrimental side effects, referring to the criteria above and
general observation of animal behavior. In contrast, 4 of
the above 9 mice did show a rapid relapse of tumor growth

after termination of treatment. Western blot analysis of
tumor tissue revealed that tumors harvested from mice with
relapse, as well as tumors from all other treatment groups,
were still positive for uPARAP at the point of sacrifice

(Supplementary Figure 1). This result pointed to incomplete
targeting and elimination of uPARAP-positive tumor cells
as being the main reason for the different outcomes for mice
in the 2h9-vc-MMAE-treated group, rather than loss of the
target receptor during treatment.
Finally, we tested the effect of systemic
treatment with 2h9-vc-MMAE. Mice were inoculated
with subcutaneous U937 tumors as above, and after
establishment of palpable tumors of 50-100 mm3, ADCs
were administered intravenously, with a total of 3
injections of 5 mg/kg mAb component in a tail vein with
four-day intervals. An additional treatment group was
included for comparison, receiving local subcutaneous
treatment with 2h9-vc-MMAE as above, but with the
same dose and treatment schedule as the groups receiving
intravenous treatment. Remarkably, intravenous treatment
with 2h9-vc-MMAE resulted in a complete cure of all
mice, with no recurrent tumor growth over a 3 month
observation period (Figure 8A). The same outcome was
obtained after local subcutaneous treatment with this
slightly elevated dose of the ADC (Figure 8B).
Survival of the intravenously treated mice is shown
in a Kaplan Meier plot (Figure 8C). Although tumors were
not completely inert to intravenous treatment with control
ADC aTNP-vc-MMAE (Figure 8A and 8C), the effect
noted in this group was much less pronounced than that
obtained with 2h9-vc-MMAE, and most likely was the
result of an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)
effect (see Discussion).
The group of mice treated systemically with 2h9vc-MMAE was followed throughout the treatment and
a 3 month observation period. The mice showed no
weight loss during the treatment period (Figure 8D), and
observations revealed no negative side effects in terms of
aberrant animal behavior.
A separate group of U937 tumor-bearing mice was
then treated with a single intravenous injection of 2h9-vcMMAE at 5 mg/kg, and upon tumor shrinkage confirmed
by palpation, these tumors were resected and subjected
to histological analysis. Staining of the tumor tissue for
apoptotic cells revealed an extensive positive staining
across the entire tumor, indicative of efficient targeting
of tumor cells by 2h9-vc-MMAE, with the surrounding
stromal tissue being largely negative for apoptosis
(Figure 8E). This pattern of extensive cell death in the
tumor tissue, with cells of the tumor stroma remaining
unaffected, was confirmed by H&E staining (Figure 8F).
To further study potential side effects, we examined
the histology of mouse livers during ADC treatment for
any signs of acute, non-specific hepatotoxicity. H&E
staining of liver sections of treated mice, obtained at
the same time point as above where tumor regression
was evident, revealed no histological abnormalities [39,
40], and no differences between untreated and treated
livers could be noted (compare Figure 8G and 8H).
Furthermore, to look into the fate of healthy cells that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

do express uPARAP, we focused on bone lining cells
that are well documented to express the receptor [41].
At the time of tumor regression, bones of treated mice
were indistinguishable from those of untreated mice, and
bone lining cells were in both cases positive for uPARAP
expression (compare Figure 8I and 8J).
Taken together, these results demonstrate highly
efficient tumor penetration and targeting of tumor cells
by ADC 2h9-vc-MMAE. Additionally, uPARAP-positive
host cells appeared to be unaffected, adding to the tumor
specificity of this ADC.

DISCUSSION
In this work, we have identified the collagen
receptor uPARAP as a novel and highly promising target
for specific drug delivery to different types of nonepithelial cancers. Cancer cells positive for this receptor
are dominant in sarcomas [11, 12], GBM [13, 14] and
subtypes of AML [15], and uPARAP positive cell lines
derived from these cancers were demonstrated to be
sensitive in vitro to our uPARAP-directed ADC in a target
receptor specific manner (Figure 4, Figure 5 and Table 1).
Treatment experiments in vivo with transplanted U937
cells in mice led to complete eradication of established
tumors (Figure 8).
The use of ADCs for targeted drug delivery is a
rapidly growing approach, with the number of new clinical
trials on ADC drugs having increased steadily for the
last decade. As of late 2016, almost 100 different ADC
species had undergone clinical testing in various forms of
cancer, with about 60 ADCs in active testing, and more
than 100 preclinical ADCs underway [42]. The process
of developing these potential drugs has led to substantial
understanding of factors critical for a successful ADC
strategy. Notably, this includes the utilization of extremely
cytotoxic agents which, in their free form, would be much
too toxic to be safely used for cancer therapy, as well as
the introduction of molecular properties that make the
ADCs non-toxic before specific release of the conjugated
toxin inside the target cell [19, 22].
The linker-toxin entity used in our work, vc-MMAE,
was originally developed in pioneering studies to create the
ADC Brentuximab Vedotin (Adcetris®), directed against
CD30-positive cancers [26, 27, 43, 44]], and since then, vcMMAE has been widely used in ADC development [21,
42]. Although the functional properties of a combination
of a certain IgG molecule and any linker-toxin construct is
unpredictable, we showed that the mAb 2h9 directed against
uPARAP could be efficiently coupled to vc-MMAE using
a reduction/maleimide conjugation method, with negligible
loss of affinity towards the target receptor. The resulting
uPARAP-directed ADC was proven to be efficacious
against a panel of uPARAP-positive cancer cell lines with
negative control cells being unaffected, demonstrating
uPARAP-dependent cytotoxicity.

The current combination of molecular target and use
of an ADC strategy has several advantageous properties.
In addition to the unique cellular expression pattern, the
targeted molecule uPARAP is an efficiently recycling
endocytic component, belonging to the clathrin-associated
group of constitutive internalization receptors with direct
lysosomal delivery of cargo [1–6]. These endocytic
properties are rarely found among existing ADC targets
in clinical testing [21, 42] and may likely contribute to
a high efficiency of ADC internalization, which in turn
may favor efficacy of treatment with this type of ADC. In
contrast, ADC targeting of cell surface proteins which are
not bona fide internalization receptors has often required
the development of specialized antibodies, which actively
induce the internalization of these targets [45], or even
more complex bispecific antibody formats, in order to
obtain efficient ADC internalization [46].
While our ADC was highly specific in killing and/
or inducing growth arrest in uPARAP-positive tumor
cells in vitro, there appeared to be no simple correlation
between the degree of sensitivity and the apparent levels
of uPARAP expression in the target cells (compare Figure
1A, Figure 4 and Table 1). A similar situation has often
been reported for other ADCs in pre-clinical studies,
where ADC cytotoxicity does not necessarily reflect the
target receptor expression level in a simple linear manner
[26, 47, 48]. Although a high expression level of any target
receptor would be considered beneficial in regards to ADC
efficacy against a certain type of cancer cell, there is a
general consensus that several additional factors influence
the overall sensitivity towards a given ADC species [19–
22]. Notably, these factors include a variable sensitivity
towards the cytotoxin component of the ADC, which in
turn may be influenced by the expression of multidrug
resistance transporters [49] and, in the case of tubulin
inhibitors such as MMAE, the propensity to cell division.
Other factors may include the overall internalization and
routing rates of ADCs [50, 51], as well as the cellular
capacity for linker cleavage. It is not unlikely that all of
these factors contribute to the variations in sensitivity
observed in our panel of cancer cell lines (Figure 4
and Table 1). In particular, we demonstrated that ADC
efficiency in highly sensitive cells such as U937 cells is
completely dependent on lysosomal linker cleavage, since
uPARAP-dependent cytotoxicity was abrogated after
inhibition of lysosomal proteases with E-64D (Figure 5C).
The mAb 2h9 was obtained after immunization of
a uPARAP gene-deficient mouse and is reactive with an
epitope shared between human and murine uPARAP [29,
30]. This leads to a great advantage when using xenograft
tumor models in mice, since treatment with a 2h9-based
ADC will not only reveal a successful targeting of human
tumor cells, but also any potential target-dependent
toxicity in the host organism. We found ADC 2h9-vcMMAE to be well tolerated at high doses in mice, and no
side-effects were observed in the three month observation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

period following successful treatment. This is not
unexpected in the light of the known expression pattern of
this receptor. Both in humans and mice, although uPARAP
is found in a variety of organs, the expression is restricted
to a limited set of activated, mesenchymal cell types in
the healthy adult organism, typically in connection with
tissue remodeling (reviewed in [6]). Although a detailed
toxicology study was not performed in this work, our
results suggest that healthy uPARAP-positive host cells are
not particularly sensitive to 2h9-vc-MMAE. A prominent
example of healthy, uPARAP-expressing cells is bone
lining cells which take part in bone collagen metabolism
[41]. However, these cells were intact and retained
uPARAP expression during ADC treatment (Figure 8I and
8J), even though at the same time point, tumor regression
and extensive apoptosis of tumor cells was evident (Figure
8E and 8F). Most likely, the resistance of bone lining cells
towards 2h9-vc-MMAE is due to factors such as a low
mitotic activity discussed above, which further contribute
to narrow the specificity of treatment to uPARAPexpressing tumor cells. Regarding generalized (non-target
related) activity of ADCs, this is often revealed in the
form of hepatotoxicity, with necrosis and inflammation
being evident upon simple inspection of liver sections as
found in mouse studies [39, 40]. However, no sign of liver
damage was observed upon treatment with 2h9-vc-MMAE
(Figure 8G and 8H).
In our xenograft tumor model with U937 cells in
CB17 SCID mice, intravenous administration of 2h9vc-MMAE led to a 100% cure rate of the treated mice.
By far the major element in this effect was a uPARAPdependent cytotoxicity, as evident from a comparison of
the four treatment groups (Figure 8A and 8C). Although
the detailed mechanism of cell death was not pursued in
vivo, immunohistochemical studies performed on 2h9vc-MMAE-treated tumors during the regression phase
showed that a single injection of 2h9-vc-MMAE led to
widespread and specific death of cancer cells, while
surrounding stromal cells remained unaffected by ADC
treatment (Figure 8E and 8F).
In addition to uPARAP-specific eradication of
tumors, a slight unspecific effect was also noted in vivo,
with the non-targeted control ADC, aTNP-vc-MMAE,
displaying a much lower but still measureable effect on
tumor growth (Figure 8A and 8C). Similar observations
have been done in other ADC studies, including
investigations that employ the vc-MMAE linker-toxin
construct with different targeting antibodies [27, 48,
52–55]. The unspecific contribution to such an antitumor effect is usually ascribed to an EPR phenomenon,
resulting in accumulation of macromolecular drugs in the
tumor microenvironment due to leaky vasculature and
a lack of lymphatic clearance, as well as extracellular
cleavage and/or degradation of ADCs in the intratumoral
area [56, 57]. To this end, additional studies have shown
that non-internalizing ADCs, based on more labile linker
44616

Oncotarget

chemistries, can even in some cases contribute to treating
solid tumors by passive diffusion of released cytotoxins
[58, 59].
In this work we utilized a well described AML
xenograft model to show the efficiency of our uPARAPdirected ADC in vivo. However, the potential therapeutic
utilization may cover several additional types of
cancers. The expression patterns described above would
point directly to sarcomas and glioblastoma as likely
indications, i.e. very severe diseases for which only few
options for targeted therapy exist [16–18]. Indeed, we
have recently studied the expression and importance of
uPARAP particularly in osteosarcoma, where just the
functional inhibition of this receptor leads to a pronounced
counteraction of tumor-mediated bone degeneration in a
mouse model [11]. In connection with treatment of this
disease, it is particularly promising that we found healthy,
uPARAP-positive bone lining cells to be tolerant to
systemic ADC treatment in the current study.
In addition to these cancer forms, uPARAP displays
a strong upregulation in the stromal compartment of
several cancers of epithelial origin, including breast [60–
62], head and neck [30] and prostate cancer, where even a
mixed tumor-stroma expression has been reported for the
latter [63, 64]. Along with an increasing understanding of
the functional importance of the tumor microenvironment,
an increasing interest is now devoted to therapeutic
targeting of stromal cells in cancer [65–68], as well as
bystander effects utilizing stromal liberation of the toxin
components of ADCs. In this connection, our uPARAPdirected ADC may also be a highly efficient reagent, due
to the cell permeability of the liberated MMAE toxin.
In all potential indications for treatment with a
uPARAP-directed ADC, the complete target specificity
is a great advantage, not only for reducing side effects
but also for the option of selecting individual patients
for treatment. Most of the diseases discussed above are
highly heterogeneous in their protein expression pattern
and therefore, an immunohistochemical examination
of primary tumor material should strongly aid the
identification of patients with a dominant expression of
the target protein.
The linker-toxin combination employed in this
study, vc-MMAE, is currently the most widely employed
construct in the ADC field [22, 42]. However, novel ADC
functionalities are continuously being developed. These
include improved and site-directed attachment chemistries,
improved linkers, and especially in current years more
potent cytotoxins [19-21, 25, 69]. These innovations all
contribute to a continuously increasing perfection of ADC
synthesis and function, while studies such as the one
presented here should potentially contribute to expanding
the scope of ADC utilization in preclinical as well as
clinical settings via the identification of novel targets.
We hope that the novel findings presented in this
work will pave the way for a further development of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

uPARAP-directed ADCs, and ultimately lead to actual
cancer therapy based on the concepts introduced in
this study. This may be an important contribution to
combatting cancer types with an urgent need for novel
means of treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antibodies and cell lines
uPARAP-directed mAbs 2h9 and 5f4 of isotype
IgG1k, as well as the isotype-matched control mAb
directed against trinitrophenol, aTNP, were produced at
the laboratory using hybridoma cell cultures as described
previously [30, 31, 70, 71]].
U937 (ATCC# CRL­1593.2), THP-1 (ATCC# TIB202), HT1080 (ATCC# CCL­121), GCT (ATCC# TIB223), RD (ATCC# CCL-136), HS683 (ATCC# HTB-138),
U373 MG (ATCC# HTB-17) and HEK293 (ATCC# CRL1573) cells were all obtained from ATCC. KNS42 cells
were kindly provided by Drs. Lara Perryman and Janine
Erler, Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC),
University of Copenhagen. NB-4 cells were kindly
provided by Dr. Kim Theilgaard-Mönch, The Finsen
Laboratory, Copenhagen University Hospital.
A U937 cell line, deficient for uPARAP expression for
use as a negative control, was prepared by CRISPR/Cas9
technology using previously published detailed protocols
[72]. In brief, a human uPARAP sgRNA1 (5′-GCCGAA
ACCGGCTATTCAACCTGG-3′) was designed to target
exon 2 of the uPARAP gene, corresponding to the Cysteinerich domain in the N-terminal part of the protein. After
sgRNA1 cloning into the plasmid pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP,
the resulting plasmid was used for transfection of U937
cells using Lipofectamine 3000. Positively transfected cells
were selected using FACS enrichment of GFP expressing
cells followed by single cell sorting into 96-well plates [73].
Single clones were screened for the absence of uPARAP
expression by flow cytometry in 96-well format using antiuPARAP mAb 5f4 for staining, and clones with a negative
staining signal in comparison to wild-type control cells
were further propagated in cell culture. uPARAP deficiency
was further confirmed by Western blotting using antiuPARAP mAb 2h9. Genomic DNA of selected clones was
purified and subjected to PCR amplification of the region
surrounding the expected Cas9 target site by use of forward
(5′-AACGTATGAGTGACGGCTCA-3′) and reverse
(5′-CTCCTCGCTGCCGTAGATG-3′) PCR primers. To
determine indels and DNA sequences of knockout clones,
the PCR-products were first purified by QIAQuick PCR
purification before direct Sanger sequencing followed
by TIDE and “mixed sequence reader” analysis [74, 75].
To this end, the uPARAP knockout (-/-) monoclone 2A3
used herein, was determined to contain a targeted 1 nt
insertion (A) and a 4 nt deletion (TTCA), respectively, in
the uPARAP-encoding alleles.

Cell lines were maintained in the following media:
unmodified U937, U937 clone 2A3, THP-1 and NB-4
in RPMI; HT1080, RD, U373, HS683 and HEK293 in
DMEM; KNS42 in DMEM/F-12, and GCT in McCoy’s
5A medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and cells
were maintained in a 37°C, 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator.

For analysis of cellular uptake of antibodies, cells
were incubated for 4 hours with AF647-labeled mAbs at 5
µg/mL. A nuclear Hoechst stain (#62249, Thermo Fisher)
was added at 2 µg/mL in cell medium for 20 minutes
before washing, followed by treatment with a mixture of
0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, Life Technologies) and 50
µg/mL proteinase K (Roche) in order to remove surfacebound antibodies. For staining of the plasma membrane,
an anti-human CD45 mAb (#368502, BioLegend) was
fluorescence-labeled using a Zenon Alexa Fluor 488
Mouse IgG1 Labeling Kit (#Z25002, Thermo Fisher
Scientific), then added to the cells at 5 µg/mL in PBS for
20 minutes. Cells were then spun down onto a microscope
glass slide (Superfrost ultra plus, Thermo Scientific)
using a Hettich cyto-system at 500xG for 1 minute in 4
mL one-funnel chambers (#M966-4, Simport, Canada),
and mounted in ProLong Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
under a cover slide. Samples were then examined using a
Leica TCS SP8 confocal laser microscope.

Western blot for detection of uPARAP expression
in cell lysates
For preparation of cell lysates, cells were treated
on ice for 20 min with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, 140
mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, including protease
inhibitor cocktail set III EDTA-free (Calbiochem) diluted
1:200), using 100µL of lysis buffer per 1x106 cells, then
centrifuged at 20,000 x G. Sample protein content was
measured by Pierce BCA analysis (ThermoFisher). 25
µg of total protein per sample was then run on a 4-12%
gradient gel using the NuPAGE Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gel
and reagent system (ThermoFisher Scientific). Using
an iBlot transfer system (Invitrogen), gel contents were
transferred to a PVDF membrane using a Novex PVDF
gel transfer stack (Invitrogen). The membrane was then
blocked in 2% BSA in PBS pH 7.4 for 30 minutes.
Membranes were then incubated in primary antibody
(anti-uPARAP mAb 2h9 at 0.5 µg/mL or anti-human
GAPDH mAb #VMA00046 from Bio-Rad (loading
control) 1:2000), diluted in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, pH
7.4, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary rabbit antimouse antibody 1:6000 (#P0260, Dako Denmark), and
treatment for 5 minutes with Amersham ECL Western
Blotting Detection Reagent (#RPN2106, GE Healthcare),
with intermediate washing steps. The blot was developed
by a brief exposure onto Amersham Hyperfilm ECL
(#28906837, GE Healthcare).
In these analyses, the THP-1 cell line displayed a
reduced GAPDH signal, although identical amounts of
total protein were analyzed and loaded as measured by
Pierce BCA analysis (Figure 1A). A parallel gel stained
with Coomassie Blue confirmed a uniform protein loading
for all cell lines analyzed (Supplementary Figure 2).

Preparation and characterization of mAb-vcMMAE ADCs
For preparation of ADCs, antibodies were subjected
to mild reduction by a 15 minute incubation at 37°C in the
presence of 10 mM DTT in a 50 mM sodium borate, 50 mM
NaCl, pH 8.0 buffer at an IgG concentration of 5 mg/mL,
followed by buffer exchange to fresh PBS pH 7.4 with 1 mM
EDTA, using 30 kDa Ultra Centrifugal Filters as described
above. This was followed by immediate conjugation by
addition of a molar excess of maleimidocaproyl-valinecitrulline-p-aminobenzoyloxycarbonyl-monomethyl
auristatin E (MC-VC-PAB-MMAE, Levena Biosystems,
San Diego, USA), dissolved in water-free DMSO to a final
DMSO content of 10% v/v during conjugation for 2 hours
at 37°C. Amounts of MC-VC-PAB-MMAE were adjusted
according to the desired DAR; see below. The resulting
mAb-vc-MMAE ADCs were purified by gel filtration on
PD-10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
The average DAR of the resulting ADCs was measured
based on the absorbance ratios of purified conjugate
preparations at λ=248nm (Amax of MMAE) and λ=280nm,
respectively, using previously determined reference values
[43, 76]. With the coupling method employed, conjugation
of MC-VC-PAB-MMAE at 5-fold molar excess over mAb
resulted in moderate DARs of 4-5, whereas conjugation at
10-fold molar excess resulted in a DAR of about 10. For
cytotoxicity studies in vitro, ADCs with a DAR~10 were
employed. Studies in vivo were performed using ADCs with
a DAR of 4-5.

Analysis of cellular uptake of fluorescence
labeled mAb against uPARAP
Fluorescently labeled antibodies 2h9 and aTNP were
prepared by subjecting the antibodies to a mild reduction
with 10 mM DTT in PBS, pH 7.4 for 30 minutes at 37°C,
followed by buffer exchange to fresh PBS pH 7.4 using a
30 kDa NMWL Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters (Merck
Millipore). Antibodies at 2 mg/mL were then allowed to
react with a 5-fold molar excess of Alexa Fluor 647 C2
Maleimide (AF647, Thermo Fischer Scientific) for 2 hours
at room temperature, and then purified by gel filtration on
PD-10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).

Electrophoretic analysis of conjugate species and
test of linker cleavage
SDS-PAGE was performed with 5 µg of total
protein per lane, using the same gel system as described
44618

Oncotarget

above for Western blotting. Samples were reduced by
boiling for 3 minutes in sample buffer in the presence
of 40 mM DTT before electrophoresis. A protein marker
was run in separate lanes for Mr determination. Gels
were stained using a standard 0.1% Coomassie blue stain.
For linker cleavage assays, samples of mAb-vc-MMAE
were treated with recombinant human (rh) Cathepsin B
(#953-CY, R&D systems) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, using 100 ng of activated rhCathepsin B
to 20 µg mAb or ADC (mAb component) in a 25 mM
2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer, pH
5.0, and incubation at 37°C overnight.

Sub-G1-, G1-, S-, or G2/M-phases of the cell cycle was
established from histogram analysis using the NucleoView
NC-3000 software.

Receptor competition assay, receptor depletion
assay and lysosomal protease inhibition
These experiments were done in the form of cell
viability assays with U937 cells, performed as above,
except that additional reagents were added, either in
a pre-treatment step or at the start of ADC treatment of
cells. Receptor competition assay was performed with
a constant 2h9-vc-MMAE concentration of 1 µg/mL
mAb component in all wells, and with the ADC and the
unmodified competing mAb being added simultaneously.
Competing mAbs were used in dilution series (1:2),
starting at 8 µg/mL and were present throughout the assay.
For receptor depletion assay, cells were pre-incubated in
the presence of mAb 5f4 at 10 µg/mL for 3 hours, before
starting a 72 hour cell viability assay in the presence of
2h9-vc-MMAE as described above. For the inhibition of
lysosomal proteases, U937 cells were pre-incubated with
20 µM of E-64D protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2
hours, before starting a 72 hour cell viability assay in the
same manner.

ELISA of uPARAP-binding by conjugated mAbs
A 96-well ELISA plate was coated with 25 ng/well
of a soluble truncated uPARAP protein comprising the first
3 domains of uPARAP, containing the epitope for mAb
2h9 [29, 30]. Dilution series of untreated mAbs (2h9 or
aTNP), partially reduced mAbs (see above), or ADCs 2h9vc-MMAE or aTNP-vc-MMAE, were then employed as
the primary antibody in an ELISA setup, followed by an
HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody
(Dako Denmark). Finally, an o-phenylenediamine
dihydrochloride (OPD) ELISA substrate solution (Dako)
was added, and the color reaction was stopped by adding
1M H2SO4. Plates were read at 492 nm using a plate
reader.

Animal experiments
All animal experiments were performed
under legal approval from The Danish Veterinary
and Food Administration, under license number
2014−15−0201−00322 (L. H. Engelholm). All reagents
and cell lines used for animal experiments were tested
negative for the presence of endotoxins, murine viruses,
bacteria, mycoplasma and fungi (Taconic Europe, Ry,
Denmark). For all studies, animals received standard of
care, according to Danish animal welfare legislation.
A xenograft model with subcutaneous inoculation
of human U937 cells was established in CB17 SCID
mice (Janvier Labs). Mice were injected subcutaneously
in the upper right flank with 1x106 U937 cells in 100 µL
PBS, resulting in the formation of tumors displaying rapid
growth, with an observed doubling in tumor volume of
approximately 3-4 days. Tumor growth was followed
by palpation using electronic calipers. Volumes were
calculated using the formula V=(LxW2)/2, with L being
the longest dimension of the tumor and W being the
corresponding tumor width.
Studies on treatment of subcutaneous tumors were
performed with either local (subcutaneous) or systemic
(intravenous) administration of reagents. For the study on
local administration, upon formation of palpable tumors
with a volume of ~50-100 mm3, mice were randomized
into four treatment groups, receiving either 2h9-vc-MMAE
(N=10), aTNP-vc-MMAE (N=9; one mouse in a group of
10 failed to develop palpable tumors), unmodified mAb

Cytotoxicity of 2h9-vc-MMAE in vitro - cell
viability assay and cell cycle analysis
For cell viability assays, cells were seeded at low
density, generally 1x103 to 2.5x103 cells per well, in a
flat-bottomed 96-well cell culture plate (Costar) in 90 µL
of cell culture medium. The next day, mAb-vc-MMAE
conjugates were prepared as a serial dilution (1:4) in
PBS and added in volumes of 10 µL to each well, with
a maximum final ADC concentration of 10 µg/mL mAb
component in cell culture medium with 10% v/v PBS.
Cells were incubated for 72 hours before evaluating
overall viability by adding 12 µL of CellTiter 96 AQueous
One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) (Promega),
and then further incubating for an appropriate time for
formation of color (15-60 mins). The plates were then
read at 490 nm, with background subtraction at 630 nm
using a plate reader, and viability calculated as percentage
of an internal plate control of untreated cells. For cell
cycle analyses, cells were seeded and treated with 2h9-vcMMAE as above, at a concentration yielding about 50%
viability in the abovementioned MTS viability assays.
After 3 days, cell cycle analysis was performed using a
Nucleocounter NC-3000 system (ChemoMetec Denmark),
according to the manufacturer’s standard protocol for
analyzing the cell cycle distribution in a population of
cells, based on DNA content. The percentage of cells in

2h9 (N=5) or PBS vehicle control (N=5). All treatments
were given as a total of four subcutaneous doses of 3 mg/kg
mAb component near the tumor, with one dose every four
days (q4dx4 schedule). Injections were performed under
brief isoflurane anesthesia. During treatment, the tumors
were measured every second day, until reaching a point
of sacrifice (euthanasia due to tumor burden). Mice which
completely lost any tumor burden were then examined twice
a week for a period of 3 months after the final injection.
For the study on systemic treatment, mice were
inoculated with U937 cells as above, again allowing
tumors to reach a volume of ~50-100 mm3 before initiation
of treatment. The four treatment groups received either
2h9-vc-MMAE (N=10), aTNP-vc-MMAE (N=10),
unmodified mAb 2h9 (N=5) or PBS vehicle control (N=5).
All treatments were given as a total of three intravenous
doses of 5 mg/kg mAb component in the tail vein, every
four days (q4dx3 schedule). During treatment, tumors
were measured every second day, until reaching a point
of sacrifice (euthanasia due to tumor burden). Mice which
completely lost any tumor burden were examined twice
a week for a period of 3 months after the final injection.
Treatment experiments were performed with the
researcher responsible for injecting mice and evaluating
tumor size being blinded from the identity of the treatment
groups.

proteinase K at 5 µg/mL (uPARAP) or 10 mM citrate
buffer, pH 6.0 (hCD45), as well as blocking of
endogenous peroxidase by 1% H2O2, before incubation
with primary detection antibody (anti-uPARAP: rabbitanti-human pAb [2] at 0.5 µg/mL, anti-hCD45: #368502,
Biolegend, at 1 µg/mL) overnight at 4°C. EnvisionHRP anti-rabbit (#4003, Dako) or Envision-HRP antimouse (#K4001, Dako) was employed as a secondary
antibody, respectively, and NovaRED HRP substrate
(#SK-4800, Vector Burlingame) was added as a color
substrate for 9 minutes before rinsing and adding a
hematoxylin counterstain (HARRIS HTX solution,
#01800, HistoLab). Samples were finally dehydrated
with increasing concentrations (70%, 96% and 99%) of
ethanol, followed by xylene, and mounted with Pertex
(#20080, Sakura Finetek). H&E staining: Samples were
deparaffinized, rinsed in water, and subjected to a staining
with hematoxylin (HARRIS HTX solution, #01800,
HistoLab) for 5 minutes followed by staining with eosin
(eosin solution 0.2%, #8702, Sakura Finetek) for 5
minutes. Samples were finally dehydrated with increasing
concentrations of ethanol followed by xylene and mounted
with Pertex, all being performed as above. Apoptosis
staining: Staining for apoptotic cells was performed using
the In situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (#ab206386, Abcam),
according to the enclosed manual. Briefly, samples
were first deparaffinized and subjected to a pretreatment
with proteinase K, as well as blocking of endogenous
peroxidase by 3% H2O2. Biotin-labeling of exposed 3′-OH
ends of DNA of apoptotic cell nuclei was then performed
by adding TdT enzyme and TdT labeling reaction mix for
90 minutes at room temperature, after which the reaction
was stopped using the stop buffer. Biotinylated DNA was
detected by incubation with a streptavidin-HRP conjugate
for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by a
diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate solution for 15 minutes
at room temperature. The samples were counterstained
with methyl green, dehydrated and mounted as above. Ki67 staining: Samples were deparaffinized and subjected
to a pretreatment with 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0 at
98°C for 10 minutes, as well as blocking of endogenous
peroxidase by 1% H2O2, before incubation with primary
detection antibody (rabbit-anti-Ki67 mAb, #ab16667,
Abcam, 1:100) overnight at 4°C. Envision-HRP anti-rabbit
(#4003, Dako) was employed as a secondary antibody, and
NovaRED HRP substrate (#SK-4800, Vector Burlingame)
was added as a color substrate for 9 minutes before rinsing
and adding a hematoxylin counterstain (HARRIS HTX
solution, #01800, HistoLab). Dehydration and mounting
of samples were then performed as described above.

Harvest and processing of tissue for
immunohistochemical staining
Tumor tissue was harvested from tumor-bearing mice
upon reaching a point of sacrifice: Mice received anesthesia
(Hypnorm/Midazolam), and the mice were perfused by
intracardial injection of 10 mL PBS. The tumors were then
surgically removed and cut in half, with one half being
immediately frozen in a mixture of dry ice and ethanol for
Western blot analysis of uPARAP expression, and one half
being transferred to a 4% PFA solution for histological
processing. Bones were dissected and transferred to a 4%
PFA solution in a similar manner. After 24 hours of incubation
at 4°C, tissue samples for histology were transferred to 70%
ethanol. Bones were decalcified in a 10% water solution of
EDTA, adjusted to pH 7.4, by microwave heating steadily
to 50°C for 20 minutes at 600W, then maintaining 50°C for
2 hours at 300W. To ensure complete decalcification, the
femurs were stored in fresh 10% EDTA, pH 7.4, for 3 days at
4°C. Samples for histology were then dehydrated with 70%,
96% and 99% ethanol, followed by xylene, and subsequently
embedded in paraffin. The embedded tissue samples
were sectioned at 3-3.5 µm on an automatic microtome
(#HM355S, Thermo Scientific), and mounted on glass slides.

CHAPS, pH 7.5, including protease inhibitor cocktail III
1:200 (VWR)), using 800 µL of lysis buffer per 150 mg
tissue. The tissue was lysed using a chilled polytron tissue
homogenizer for 2x20 seconds, or until homogenous
appearance. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 x G at 4°C,
and the supernatant transferred to fresh tubes. The protein
content was determined by BCA analysis as above. Tissue
lysate samples of 20µg total protein per lane were separated
by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane, as
described above. For specific detection of uPARAP, mAb
2h9 was labeled with 125I [77]. The membrane was then
blocked in 2% BSA, and incubated overnight at 4°C with 20
ng/mL of the radiolabeled detection antibody, before being
washed in PBS pH 7.4 and water. Using a Fuji FLA-3000
system, an imaging plate was then exposed to the membrane
overnight, and developed the following day.
