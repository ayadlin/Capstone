PAX3-FOXO1 Induces Cannabinoid Receptor 1 to Enhance
Cell Invasion and Metastasis
Amy D. Marshall, Irina Lagutina, and Gerard C. Grosveld

Abstract
Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is a muscle-derived childhood tumor characterized by production of
oncogenic PAX3/7-FOXO1 chimeric transcription factors. While downstream targets of the PAX3-FOXO1
oncoprotein in ARMS have been deﬁned, the functional relevance of these targets is unclear. Here, we show
that upregulation of the cannabinoid receptor 1 (Cnr1/Cb1) by PAX3-FOXO1 in mouse primary myoblasts and
ARMS cell lines, contributes to PAX3-FOXO1 phenotypes, both in vivo and in vitro. In primary myoblasts, Cnr1 was
dispensable for PAX3-FOXO1 to mediate cell proliferation, differentiation, or transformation; however, Cnr1
function was essential to increase the invasive capacity conferred by PAX3-FOXO1 overexpression in these cells.
Genetic or pharmacologic abrogation of Cnr1 inhibited the enhanced basement membrane invasion induced by
PAX3-FOXO1. Cnr1 loss by either route also dramatically reduced lung metastasis formation. Taken together, our
ﬁndings strongly implicate Cnr1 as a novel tractable target to inhibit ARMS invasion and metastasis. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Rhabdomyosarcoma is a pediatric soft tissue tumor derived
from the skeletal muscle lineage that expresses many musclespeciﬁc proteins (1). Most commonly, rhabdomyosarcoma
presents in one of two histologic subtypes; embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) or alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma
(ARMS; ref. 1). Recent clinical advances have improved the
outcome for patients with both ARMS and ERMS; however,
patients with the more aggressive and metastatic ARMS subtype have a poorer prognosis than patients with ERMS (2).
ARMS is histologically characterized by tumors containing
small, round, densely packed cells usually surrounding alveolar-like structures reminiscent of the lung (1). More than 75%
of ARMS tumors possess a t(2;13)(q35;q14) translocation or the
variant t(1;13)(p36;q14) translocation which generate PAX3FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1 fusion proteins, respectively (3–5).
These fusion proteins contain the complete paired and homeobox-DNA–binding domains of the PAX3/7 protein and the
transcriptional activation domain of FOXO1 (FKHR) which is
more potent than that of PAX3/7 (4, 6). Among patients with
ARMS, those possessing the PAX3-FOXO1 translocation have
the poorest survival rates, particularly those with metastatic

disease at diagnosis, which is the case in about a quarter of
patients (1, 3).
ERMS and ARMS have distinct gene expression proﬁles.
Recent microarray studies including those of Wachtel and
colleagues (7), Davicioni and colleagues (8), and Lae and
colleagues (9) have identiﬁed cannabinoid receptor 1
(CNR1/CB1) upregulation as a marker of ARMS tumors. Speciﬁcally, CNR1 is overexpressed in PAX3/7-FOXO1 fusionpositive ARMS tumors (7). Moreover, microarray analysis of
an osteosarcoma cell line (U2-OS) expressing PAX3-FOXO1
showed increased CNR1 expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that PAX3 and PAX3FOXO1 bind to upstream of the human CNR1 gene (10).
CNR1 is a G-protein–coupled receptor which is predominantly expressed in the brain but is also in the testes and
skeletal muscle at much lower levels (11–13). The Cb1/
mouse lacking the gene encoding Cnr1 was developed by
Zimmer and colleagues (14). These mice appear healthy and
fertile but show hypoactivity, hypoalgesia, and increased mortality. No skeletal muscle phenotype has been reported in these
animals, although in rat L6 skeletal muscle myotubes, treatment with Cnr1 inverse agonist/antagonist rimonabant
(SR141716A) increases glucose uptake (15), indicating a possible role for Cnr1 in skeletal muscle glucose metabolism. Cnr1
can exist in 3 states; active bound to ligand, inactive not bound
to ligand, and in a ligand-independent constitutively active
state. Therefore, Cnr1 is capable of inducing a biological signal
in the absence of ligand (16). Cnr1 is capable of signaling via a
variety of different cell signaling pathways including; G-proteins, adenylyl cyclase, mitogen-activated protein kinase
[MAPK; p38-MAPK, extracellular signal–regulated kinase
(ERK), and c-jun-NH2-kinase (JNK)] and phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K; for review see ref. 17). The effect that Cnr1
signaling induces likely depends on the cell context in which

it is expressed. Cnr1 expression outside the brain has been
associated with cell migration and tumor growth (18–20).
Here, we show that Cnr1 is upregulated by the ARMS fusion
protein PAX3-FOXO1. The PAX3-FOXO1 upregulation of Cnr1
is required for, but not sufﬁcient to, increase the invasive
capacity of primary myoblasts through ex vivo peritoneum
basement membranes. This invasion capacity can be
abrogated by treatment with Cnr1 inverse agonist AM251, but
only partially by neutral agonist URB447, indicating that Cnr1
ligand-independent signaling is at least partially responsible
for the enhanced invasive capacity. Moreover, in vivo assays
show that treatment with the cannabinoid receptor inverse
agonist AM251, or loss of the Cnr1 gene, can abrogate lung
metastasis formation in an ARMS metastasis model. These
results show that Cnr1 expression is an important player in
ARMS tumor cell propensity for invasion and metastasis.
Therefore, Cnr1 represents a potential novel therapeutic target
to inhibit the metastatic capacity of this aggressive pediatric
sarcoma.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Primary myoblasts were isolated from P1-P5 C57B6, Cb1/
(14), INK4a-ARF/ (21), INK4a-ARF//Cb1/, or ARF/
(22) mice as per the protocol of Rando and colleagues (23)
and Bois and colleagues (24) and cultured in Ham's F-10
(Invitrogen or HyClone) with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL
streptomycin (P/S; Invitrogen), 1 ng/mL basic ﬁbroblast
growth factor (bFGF; PeproTech), 20% HyClone serum lot#:

AHA7632 or cell generation serum lot#: 133F05 for in vivo
studies, or 10% cosmic calf serum (HyClone) for in vitro studies
and 10 mmol/L HEPES, on collagen (Becton Dickenson) or
gelatin (Stem Cell Technologies) coated dishes at 37 C, 5% CO2,
and 6% O2. Primary myoblasts were differentiated with Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM), 2 mmol/L glutamax (Invitrogen), 2% horse serum (HS; Invitrogen) and P/S
(23). Rhabdomyosarcoma lines RD, JR1, RH6, RH2 (ERMS) and
RH30, RH4, RH41, RH3, and RH28 (ARMS) authenticated by the
expression of myogenic markers (data not shown) by Western
blotting and ARMS lines expressing PAX3-FOXO1 (Fig. 1B)
were obtained from Dr. Peter Houghton in 2005 (Nationwide
Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH) and were cultured in
DMEM, glutamax, 10% FBS, and P/S.
Proliferation assays were conducted with 10,000 cells per
well on collagen-coated 24-well plates (Becton Dickenson) and
counted daily for 6 days. Triplicate anchorage-independent
growth assays (25) were conducted with 20,000 cells in 0.3%
agar noble over 0.6% agar in complete media. Colonies were
grown over 2 weeks at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 6% O2. Plates were
then photographed using the Geldoc System (Bio-Rad) and
colonies counted with the Quantity One 4.6.5 Software (BioRad). Apoptosis assays were conducted by plating 1,000 cells in
100 mL on a 96-well collagen-coated plate (Becton Dickenson).
A media change was carried out 24 hours later to contain
Met-F-AEA in absolute ethanol vehicle at the indicated concentrations. After a further 24 hours, 100 mL of Apo-ONE
Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assay reagent (Promega) was
added, and caspase activity was determined according to the
manufacturer's instructions.

Cnr1 Enhances Invasive and Metastatic Activity in ARMS

Constructs
PAX3, PAX3-FOXO1, Cnr1 or D417-Cnr1 (26), E7 or luc2 were
cloned behind the long terminal repeat (LTR) in MSCV-IRESGFP or YFP, MSCV-SV40-Puro, or pBabe-SV40-Puro plasmids
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Retroviruses were produced using
phoenix eco cells (27) and applied to primary myoblasts with 8
mg/mL polybrene for 2 hours. Cells were then ﬂuorescenceactivated cell sorted for ﬂuorescent label or selected with 1.5
mg/mL puromycin.
PCR
RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as per the
manufacturer's instructions, treated with DNaseI (Invitrogen)
followed by the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System
for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer's protocol.
Real-time PCR was carried out by TaqMan Universal PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.3 mmol/L of primers, and
0.2 mmol/L of probes as follows: mCnr1 forward (fwd) 50 TGTACATTCTCTGGAAGGCTCACA-30 , mCnr1 reverse (rev)

were normalized to Mouse GAPDH Endogenous Control
(VIC/MGB Probe, Primer Limited; Applied Biosystems 435
2339). Reactions were carried out with the ABI prism 7900HT
and SDS2.1 software (Applied Biosystems). Nonquantitative
reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for ARMS PAX3-FOXO1
and PAX7-FOXO1 translocation genotyping was carried out as
per Barr and colleagues (28).
Western blotting
Western blotting was carried out with the following antibodies: 1:1,000 rabbit anti-PAX3 (29), 1:1,000 rabbit anti-pan-actin
(Cell Signaling), 1:10,000 horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Jackson Laboratories). Densitometry was
carried out with Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad).

myoblasts (originally isolated in HyClone serum lot#; AHA7632)
or 1  106 INK4a-ARF/ or INK4a-ARF//Cb1/ primary
myoblasts (originally isolated in cell generation serum lot#:
133F05) expressing E7-Puro (to abrogate the pRb pathway),
PAX3-FOXO1-IRES-GFP and luc2-IRES-YFP in 100-mL PBS
were injected into the tail vein of NOD/SCID (nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeﬁcient) IL2Rg null mice (31). Mice
were imaged using IVIS Imaging Systems (Xenogen). Animals
were injected intraperitoneally with 200 mL of 15 mg/mL D-luciferin and imaged for luc2 expression on days 1, 5, 7, and 10 after
tail vein injection. The luminescence in the lung region was
quantitated with Living Image 3.1 software (Xenogen).
Lungs were ﬁxed, embedded, and sectioned. Sections were
dewaxed and antigen retrieved in boiling citrate buffer, pH 6
(Invitrogen), 15 minutes. Samples were treated with 3% H2O2 in
methanol, the Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit (Vector Laboratories), and Protein Block Serum-Free (Dako). Rabbit anti-GFP
(1:4,000; Abcam) diluted in antibody diluent solution (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at room temperature and detected by 1:250
biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories) and
LSAB2 Streptavidin-HRP (Dako) followed by Liquid DABþ
Substrate Chromogen system (Dako). Slides were stained with
Gill hematoxylin and permounted. Micrographs were taken at
40 magniﬁcation across the whole lung section, and the
number of GFP/YFP-positive metastases per ﬁeld was counted.
For comparison of Cb1þ/þ versus Cb1/ primary myoblast
lung metastasis formation, lungs were removed from mice at
day 70, ﬁxed, imbedded, and sectioned. GFP/YFP and H&E
staining was conducted, and micrographs of whole lung sections were taken with a dissection microscope.

Results

Ex vivo basement membrane invasion assay
The ex vivo basement membrane invasion assay was conducted as described (30). Brieﬂy the peritonea from 8- to 12week-old C57B6 female mice were mounted over 6.5-mm
Transwell inserts (Fisher). Peritoneum constructs were then
treated with 1 mol/L ammonium hydroxide for 1 hour and
washed extensively. A total of 5  105 INK4a-ARF/ primary
myoblasts were then applied to at least duplicate constructs in
media for 12 days. Cells were treated daily with 300 nmol/L
AM251, 2 mmol/L URB447, or DMSO vehicle; and 10 mmol/L
Met-F-AEA or absolute ethanol vehicle in media. Constructs
were ﬁxed, cross-sectioned, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
stained. The average number ( SE) of invading cells per 400
microscopic ﬁeld was counted from 6 ﬁelds, and results were
normalized to empty vector control.

Cnr1 expression is induced by the PAX3-FOXO1
oncogene
Given that CNR1 has been identiﬁed as being highly
expressed in fusion-positive ARMS tumors (7–10), real-time
PCR analysis was conducted to determine the relative expression of CNR1 in primary mouse myoblasts expressing either
PAX3 or PAX3-FOXO1. Cnr1 was increased 3-fold in PAX3 and
170-fold in PAX3-FOXO1 samples (Fig. 1A). To conﬁrm this,
CNR1 expression was compared between ERMS and ARMS cell
lines. CNR1 expression was upregulated between 180-fold in
RH30 and 150,000-fold in RH3 over RH2 (the highest CNR1
expresser among ERMS lines; Fig. 1B). Furthermore, CNR1
expression was upregulated 175- to 330-fold in 3/4 ARMS tumor
samples over the highest expressing ERMS tumor (Fig. 1C). The
ARMS tumor sample without CNR1 upregulation, tested negative for PAX3/7-FOXO1 translocation gene products, indicating this sample represents a fusion-negative ARMS tumor
(Fig. 1D). This corroborates data from others that CNR1 upregulation is speciﬁc to fusion-positive ARMS (7, 9, 10, 32).

In vivo lung metastasis assay
Mice were pretreated one day prior to tail vein injection and
continued on treatment for a further 10 days with 3 mg/kg/d
intraperitoneally of AM251 in 3.6% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),

Cnr1 upregulation does not contribute to proliferation,

PAX3 overexpression also resulted in an increase in proliferation rate greater than empty vector or PAX3-FOXO1 (Fig. 2A),
likely due to differences in expression [Supplementary Fig. S1B
(i)]. Expression in Cb1/ primary myoblasts continued to
result in an equivalent increase in proliferation rate (Fig. 2A
and B).
PAX3-FOXO1 expression in primary myoblasts results in
the inhibition of myogenic differentiation. As seen in Fig. 2C,
Cb1/ myoblasts were indistinguishable from wild-type
primary myoblasts. In addition, Cnr1 overexpression
[Supplementary Fig. S1B (ii)] did not affect myoblast differentiation in either wild-type or Cb1/ myoblasts.
PAX3-FOXO1 expression alone is not sufﬁcient to transform
primary myoblasts, additional abrogation of the p53 and pRb

pathways are required (33–35). Therefore, in transformation
assays, we used INK4a-ARF/ mouse myoblasts. To determine whether Cnr1 may play a role in the transformation
capacity of PAX3-FOXO1, we transduced INK4a-ARF/ or
INK4a-ARF//Cb1/ myoblasts with empty vector, PAX3,
PAX3-FOXO1, or CNR1. PAX3-FOXO1 increased colony formation by these cells compared with empty vector controls
[Fig. 2D (i) and (ii)]. PAX3 or Cnr1 overexpression did not
enhance colony formation, and Cb1/ cells were not signiﬁcantly different from their Cb1þ/þ counterparts.
Previously, it has been reported that treatment with the
CNR1 agonist Met-F-AEA can induce apoptosis in ARMS cell
lines (32). Treatment with either 3 or 30 mmol/L Met-F-AEA for
24 hours failed to induce any increase in apoptosis over that

Cnr1 Enhances Invasive and Metastatic Activity in ARMS

seen in vehicle treated wild-type or Cb1/ primary myoblasts
expressing empty vector, PAX3, PAX3-FOXO1, or CNR1 [Fig. 2E
(i)]. In ARMS cell lines, we only observed a small increase in
apoptosis with MET-F-AEA treatment in RH41 and only after
48 hours of treatment [Fig. 2E (ii)].
These results show that although CNR1 is grossly upregulated by PAX3-FOXO1 it does not play an appreciable role in
enhanced proliferation, inhibited differentiation, or enhanced
transformation seen with PAX3-FOXO1 expression in primary
myoblasts.
Cnr1 is required, but not sufﬁcient, for increased cell
invasion driven by PAX3-FOXO1
Patients with ARMS tumors are more likely to present with
metastatic disease than ERMS (36). Moreover, PAX3-FOXO1–

positive ARMS tumors have an increased propensity for localized invasiveness (3). This increased invasive and metastatic
capacity contribute to the poorer prognosis associated with
ARMS (1–3). Because Cnr1 has been associated with cell
migration and tumor invasiveness (19, 20, 37–39), we wished
to determine whether Cnr1 played a role in this PAX3-FOXO1–
dependent phenotype.
INK4a-ARF/ primary myoblasts were used in an in vitro
invasion assay using ex vivo basement membranes from the
peritoneum of mice. Those cells expressing PAX3-FOXO1
showed increased invasion capacity over vector-only controls
(Fig. 3A). However, INK4a-ARF//Cb1/ primary myoblasts
expressing PAX3-FOXO1 failed to invade as well as Cb1þ/þ
counterparts and were indistinguishable from empty vector (Fig. 3A). To further conﬁrm this result, INK4a-ARF/

primary myoblasts expressing PAX3-FOXO1 or empty vector
were treated with the speciﬁc Cnr1 antagonist/inverse agonist
AM251 which inhibits both ligand-dependent and constitutively active Cnr1 signaling. PAX3-FOXO1 showed enhanced
invasion over cells expressing vehicle alone, but this increase
was completely abrogated in the presence of AM251 (Fig. 3B).
Cnr1 overexpression alone was insufﬁcient to induce this
increased invasive capacity in the absence of PAX3FOXO1 (Fig. 3C). However, reintroduction of Cnr1 in
INK4a-ARF//Cb1/ primary myoblasts expressing PAX3FOXO1 restores the ability of these cells to invade. Expression
of the D417 Cnr1 mutant (Supplementary Fig. S1C) lacking the
distal C-terminal tail of Cnr1 which is involved in repressing
constitutive activity (26), results in increased invasion in
INK4a-ARF//Cb1/ primary myoblasts irrespective of
PAX3-FOXO1 cotransduction (Fig. 3C).
To further investigate the mechanism by which Cnr1
induces an increase in invasion in PAX3-FOXO1 expressing
myoblasts, we treated cells in the invasion assay with URB447, a
Cnr1 neutral agonist which inhibits only ligand-dependent
signaling, and MET-F-AEA a Cnr1 ligand/agonist. Compared
with AM251, which completely abrogates the enhanced invasive capacity of PAX3-FOXO1 expressing primary myoblasts,
the neutral agonist URB447 only reduced invasion capacity
slightly (Fig. 3D). Moreover, treatment with agonist Met-F-AEA
failed to further enhance cell invasive capacity and actually
signiﬁcantly inhibited invasion (Fig. 3E).

prevents ARMS lung metastasis formation in this animal
model.
A similar experiment was carried out, this time treating with
the Cnr1 neutral agonist URB447 (data not shown). No significant reduction of lung metastases was seen, concurring with
in vitro data where Cnr1 constitutive activity was required for
invasive capacity.
To verify that this was the speciﬁc effect of Cnr1 affecting
lung metastasis formation, we injected INK4a-ARF/ and
INK4a-ARF//Cb1/ primary myoblasts expressing E7,
PAX3-FOXO1, and luc2 into the tail vein of NOD/SCID IL2Rg null
mice. We were unable to generate lung metastasis with INK4aARF/ loss alone, thus E7 was added to further abrogate the
pRb pathway (for review, see ref. 40). Though the latency of
tumor formation was longer due to a difference in the serum
used to initially isolate the primary myoblasts (Fig. 5A), we
could see a signiﬁcant difference in lung metastasis formation
comparing mice of a Cb1þ/þ versus a Cb1/ genotype (Fig. 5B
and C). Gross appearance of lung sections is shown in Fig. 5C.
Lung metastasis can be seen by H&E and anti-GFP staining.
Numerous GFP-positive tumors could be detected in the lungs
of mice injected with cells of the Cb1þ/þ genotype, whereas
only a single GFP-positive tumor could be detected among
the lung sections of all 5 mice injected with myoblasts with a
Cb1/ genotype.

Pharmacologic or genetic abrogation of Cnr1 inhibits
lung metastasis formation
To determine whether an inverse agonist such as AM251
could prevent ARMS metastasis formation in vivo, we
developed an ARMS lung metastasis model. Lung metastasis
occurs in 25% of metastatic ARMS cases (3). Injection of 1 
106 ARF/ primary myoblast cells expressing the human
papilloma virus protein E7 (to abrogate the pRb pathway),
PAX3-FOXO1 and luc2 into the tail vein of NOD/SCID
IL2Rg null mice resulted in luc2 signal in the lungs within
24 hours of administration. Over time, these cells invade
into lung tissue and develop metastatic lesions, if unattended, animals die within 4 weeks due to respiratory failure
(data not shown). To determine whether a CNR1 antagonist
could be used to prevent metastasis formation, we treated
mice with 3 mg/kg/d intraperitoneal AM251. After one day
of AM251 treatment, mice were injected intravenously
with PAX3-FOXO1 expressing cells and luc2 activity in the
lung area was monitored for the next 10 days (Fig. 4A).
Twenty-four hours postinjection, there was no signiﬁcant
difference in lung localized luciferase activity between
AM251 and vehicle-treated mice. After 5 days, luciferase
activity from the lung was signiﬁcantly reduced in
AM251-treated animals and this reduction was maintained
to 10 days (Fig. 4B). The lungs from mice were sectioned and
stained for GFP/YFP expression to detect lung metastasis.
AM251 treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the
number of metastases compared with vehicle-only–treated
animals (Fig. 4C). Representative staining is shown in Fig.
4D. Thus inhibition of Cnr1 by inverse agonist AM251

ARMS is a particularly aggressive form of rhabdomyosarcoma and is associated with an increased propensity for
metastasis (2). ARMS tumors are typically characterized by
the presence of a t(2;13)(q35;q14) chromosomal translocation
or variant t(1;13)(p36;q14) resulting in a PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7FOXO1 fusion transcription factor, respectively (3–5). We and
others (7–10, 32) have identiﬁed Cnr1 as a target gene of PAX3/
7-FOXO1. We have shown that PAX3-FOXO1 expression results
in an increased capacity for primary myoblasts to invade
through an ex vivo basement membrane. Moreover, we have
shown that Cnr1, upregulated by PAX3-FOXO1, is necessary for
this increased invasive capacity. Treatment with AM251, an
inverse agonist of Cnr1, abrogates both cell invasion in vitro
and lung metastasis formation in vivo. These results show that
Cnr1 expression, downstream of PAX3-FOXO1, contributes to
the aggressive behavior of fusion-positive ARMS.
In primary myoblasts, a cell likely to resemble the cell of
origin for ARMS, absence of Cnr1 prevents PAX3-FOXO1–
induced enhanced invasive capacity. Cnr1 expression has been
associated with invasive capacity in several different tumor
types. In breast cancer cells, a more invasive phenotype was
associated with Cnr1 expression (41). Cnr1 agonists can induce
the migration of HEK-293 and normal primary bone marrow
cells (19, 39) and Cnr1 antagonist rimonabant can decrease
vascular smooth muscle cell migration (20). Conversely, Cnr1
agonists inhibit leukocyte and colon carcinoma cell migration
(38). Therefore, it is conceivable that Cnr1 expression in other
tumor cell types could also lead to increased invasive capacity,
meaning drugs targeting Cnr1 could also be useful to inhibit
metastatic disease of other tumor types.

Cnr1 expression has also been linked with cell proliferation.
In thyroid, breast, glioma, and prostate cancer cells, Cnr1
agonists inhibited proliferation which could be abrogated by
antagonists (18, 41–43). Moreover, conﬂicting results have
been obtained in colorectal cancer where Cnr1 agonists can
induce apoptosis and inhibit growth, whereas antagonist
treatment can either accelerate or prevent precancerous lesion
formation, depending on the animal model used (37, 44, 45).
However, we could ﬁnd no contribution of Cnr1 to PAX3FOXO1–induced myoblast growth. Cnr1 expression can have
different effects depending on the cell context in which it is
expressed. This is most likely due to the ability of Cnr1 to
activate a number of different signaling pathways including;
G-proteins, adenylyl cyclase, MAPK (p38-MAPK, ERK, and
JNK), and PI3K (for review see ref. 17) which can induce
numerous different effects in different cell types.
Recently, Oesch and colleagues (32) reported that treatment of ARMS cell lines, RH4 in particular, with Cnr1
agonists induced apoptosis. We did not ﬁnd induction of
apoptosis in RH4 with treatment of MET-F-AEA [Fig. 2E (ii)].
Of the 5 ARMS cell lines tested, only RH41 showed a small
increase in apoptosis after 48 hours incubation with MET-FAEA [Fig. 2E (ii)]. In addition, apoptosis was not induced in
primary myoblasts by MET-F-AEA, irrespective of PAX3FOXO1 or CNR1 expression [Fig. 2E (i)], suggesting that this
proapoptotic effect is not universal in ARMS. It is unknown
whether Cnr1 agonists will prove useful clinically for the
induction of apoptosis in ARMS. In our ex vivo basement

membrane invasion assay, we found that Met-F-AEA did not
further induce, and in fact slightly inhibited, invasion of
primary INK4a-ARF/ myoblasts expressing PAX3-FOXO1.
Therefore, agonist treatment in vitro would be unlikely to
enhance cell invasive capacity. So, if MET-F-AEA or other
CNR1 agonists would prove useful to induce apoptosis in
ARMS, treatment with such drugs seems unlikely to further
enhance invasive and metastatic capacity.
ARMS tumors metastasize to the lung in about 25% of
metastatic ARMS cases (3). Consistent with this, we successfully developed a model for lung metastases. Primary ARF/
myoblasts expressing E7, PAX3-FOXO1, and luc2 injected into
the tail vein preferentially form metastases in the lung tissue.
ARMS tumors have a higher propensity for metastasis than
ERMS (36), and PAX3-FOXO1–positive ARMS in particular are
associated with higher local tumor invasiveness and a poorer
prognosis if presenting with metastatic disease (3). We have
shown that Cnr1 expression downstream of PAX3-FOXO1
expression increases ex vivo basement membrane invasion
capacity in vitro, a characteristic that is abrogated in Cb1/
myoblasts or by AM251 treatment. Only D417-Cnr1, a mutant
with enhanced constitutive activity, is able to enhance invasion
in the absence of PAX3-FOXO1, indicating PAX3-FOXO1
expression modulates the expression of other, as yet unidentiﬁed, proteins involved in the transmission of Cnr1 signal
within myoblasts.
ERMS is also known to metastasize to the lung (1). Cnr1 is
not upregulated in ERMS, indicating that Cnr1 is not required

an alternative mechanism. This indicates that Cnr1-driven
metastasis is a unique feature of fusion-positive ARMS. The
most common site of metastasis for PAX3-FOXO1–positive
ARMS is the bone marrow (3). We attempted to model ARMS
bone marrow metastasis, by injecting transformed primary
myoblasts into the left ventricle of the heart. This avoids

Cnr1 Enhances Invasive and Metastatic Activity in ARMS

these ARMS cell lines. After exploring multiple different
approaches to this problem, we did not observe reliable
formation of bone marrow metastases with any of the cell
types used. Therefore, we were unable to determine whether
CNR1 plays a role in the propensity of ARMS to form bone
marrow metastases.
In vivo inhibition of Cnr1 with AM251 or genetic deletion can
abrogate lung metastasis formation. Because this invasive
capacity was less affected by treatment with the neutral
agonist URB447 and not enhanced by MET-F-AEA agonist
treatment, increased invasive capacity is at least partially
downstream of constitutive Cnr1 signaling. Therefore a limitation of Cnr1 antagonists for ARMS treatment is that they
would have to be administered early enough in disease progression to prevent the invasion of circulating, potentially
metastatic, tumor cells. Moreover, these drugs would not affect
the growth of the primary tumor, or micrometastases that are
already established, as Cnr1 does not inﬂuence PAX3-FOXO1–
induced myoblast proliferation or transformation. Despite
these limitations, the combination of Cnr1 antagonists with
the current standard of care for ARMS could prove useful
clinically to prevent further metastasis formation, potentially
prolonging the life of the patient.
One could envision that inhibition of Cnr1 activity within
ARMS cells could be useful therapeutically to reduce invasive
and metastatic capacity of ARMS. Use of Cnr1 antagonist
rimonabant in humans, however, is associated with undesirable side effects. In November 2008, the development of
rimonabant, for weight loss and smoking cessation, was abandoned by Sanoﬁ-Aventis. This was due to failure to achieve U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval owing to
concern over depressive psychiatric side effects (46). With

respect to Cnr1 expression in ARMS tumor cells, given that
brain metastases are rare in rhabdomyosarcoma (2.4%; ref. 47),
treatment with a Cnr1 antagonist that is unable to pass
through the blood–brain barrier would likely be sufﬁcient to
play a therapeutic role. Unfortunately, the only commercially
available peripherally restricted Cnr1/2 antagonist, URB447,
proves ineffective in our model, because it acts only as neutral
agonist to Cnr1 (48) and Cnr1 constitutive activity is at least
partially responsible for PAX3-FOXO1–induced invasion. The
development of a peripherally restricted Cnr1-speciﬁc inverse
agonist would represent a potential novel therapy for the
inhibition of metastasis formation in patients with ARMS.
