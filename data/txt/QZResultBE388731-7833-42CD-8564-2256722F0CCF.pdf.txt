BACKGROUND. The aim was to determine the long-term outcome for patients
with FIGO stage IV epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) treated with intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy after second-look assessment.

METHODS. By using data from a retrospective cohort of 433 patients who received
IP therapy after second-look assessment after primary surgery and initial systemic therapy for EOC between 1984 and 1998 at our institution, all FIGO stage

IIIC and IV patients were identified. Standard statistical methods were used.

RESULTS. Overall, 297 patients met study criteria (246 stage IIIC; 51 stage IV).
The median survival for patients with stage IV disease was 34 months compared
with 42 months for patients with stage IIIC disease (P 5 .02). The only significant
predictor of overall survival in patients with stage IV disease was the presence of
gross residual disease at initiation of IP therapy (P 5 .027). When comparing
stage IV patients with and without pleural effusions to all stage IIIC patients,
there was a significant trend toward improved survival in the patients with pleural effusions only compared with other stage IV patients (P 5 .01).

CONCLUSIONS. Prolonged overall survival was observed in patients with no gross
residual disease at the time of IP chemotherapy initiation. When compared with
similarly treated stage IIIC patients, stage IV patients with malignant pleural effusions appear to have a better outcome than those with other sites of metastasis.
Future prospective trials should evaluate the use of IP therapy for patients with
stage IV EOC by virtue of malignant pleural effusions only who responded to initial systemic therapy. Cancer 2008;112:2690–7.  2008 American Cancer Society.

n the US, epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the eighth most common cancer among women and the fifth leading cause of death,
accounting for the most deaths among women with gynecologic
malignancies.1 The implementation of comprehensive surgery and
platinum plus taxane-based chemotherapy has significantly
improved median survival to 57 months over the course of time for
patients who are optimally debulked.2 However, as many as 40% to
50% of patients who achieve pathological complete remission after
cytoreductive surgery and standard adjuvant chemotherapy will
relapse and eventually develop chemotherapy-resistant disease. The
majority of the recurrent disease will be confined to the peritoneal
cavity.3–5 This has prompted numerous clinical trials to evaluate the

role of additional intravenous or intraperitoneal (IP)
treatment as consolidation strategies. Studies investigating the use of IP chemotherapy in patients with
stage III or IV EOC after second-look assessment
have noted prolonged survival in select patients with
minimal residual disease at the time of second-look
assessment.6–9 Recent large, randomized, controlled
phase 3 trials of up-front IP chemotherapy for optimally debulked stage III EOC have shown an
improvement in overall survival compared with intravenous chemotherapy alone.10–12
Stage IV EOC, which accounts for only 16% of
ovarian cancers, is noted for its poor long-term outcome, with estimated 5-year survival rates of 7% to
17%.13–15 Many authors have reported that optimal
cytoreduction is an important determinant of survival in patients with stage IV EOC, advocating optimal debulking of IP disease,13,15–18 whereas some
have reported no difference in survival, arguing that
the biology of stage IV disease makes aggressive
cytoreductive surgery inappropriate.14,19 In patients
with stage IV EOC, the response rate to intravenous
chemotherapy is comparable to that of patients with
less-advanced disease.20 Little is known about IP
therapy for patients with stage IV disease, and no
data are available comparing the different subsets of
stage IV diseases with regard to the site of extraperitoneal disease and IP therapy. Many practitioners
will not offer up-front IP therapy to patients with
optimally debulked stage IV disease because there
has been no proven benefit demonstrated in randomized phase 3 trials for this group of patients.
The aim of this study was to evaluate overall survival in patients with stage IV EOC treated with IP
chemotherapy after second-look assessment. Within
the group of patients with stage IV disease, we also
sought to determine how outcome was affected by
site of metastasis and considered this in relation to
similarly treated stage IIIC patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients of this analysis were derived from a previously published retrospective database of 433
patients who received IP chemotherapy after secondlook assessment after intravenous primary therapy
for ovarian cancer between 1984 and 1998 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The majority of
these patients were treated on phase 2 clinical trials
(n 5 285), whereas the remainder (n 5 126) were
treated off-protocol.9,21–24 In this study we retrospectively reviewed the records of 297 patients with stage
IIIC and IV EOC after obtaining Institutional Review
Board approval.6 IP therapy was administered as

2691

consolidation therapy after negative second-look
assessment (n 5 59) or for treatment of persistent
small volume disease (microscopic disease or residual tumor <1 cm, n 5 211) or bulky disease (>1 cm,
n 5 27) noted at the time of second-look surgical
assessment after primary surgery and initial systemic
therapy. Patients with nonepithelial histologic subtypes, borderline cancers, earlier stage disease, or
those treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
were not included. The majority of patients (n 5
277) had a clinical response to primary therapy (normalization of symptoms, normal clinical examination, and/or normal radiologic findings, and/or
normalization of CA 125 <35 U/mL) before undergoing second-look reassessment. The remainder (n 5
20) had clinical evidence of persistent or progressive
disease.
Data were extracted for patient age, stage, histologic subtype, grade, surgical debulking status
(optimal vs suboptimal), presence of paclitaxel in the
primary regimen, presence of platinum in the IP regimen, size of residual disease at initiation of IP therapy, and overall survival. All patients included in the
study had undergone a second-look surgical assessment of disease, which defined the size of residual
disease at initiation of IP therapy. Stage IIIC and IV
EOC was defined according to the criteria outlined
by the Oncology Committee of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO).25 Follow-up data were available for 286 patients, of whom
51 had documented stage IV disease and 235 had
stage IIIC disease.
Second-look assessments were performed both
via laparotomy and laparoscopy. Secondary cytoreductive surgery was performed in 10 patients with
bulky disease at the time of second-look assessment.
IP treatment was administered through a subcutaneous titanium implanted port with a fully fenestrated catheter (Bard Access Systems, Salt Lake City,
Utah, part #0603006 or similar), which was generally
placed at the time of second-look assessment. Chemotherapy agents used alone or in combination
included cisplatin, carboplatin, etoposide, 5-flourouracil, floxuridine, cytarabine, mitoxantrone, paclitaxel,
and gemcitabine. Overall survival was defined as the
interval from second-look surgery until death or last
follow-up. Statistical analyses included tests for associations within or between potential prognostic
factors and survival. Survival probabilities were estimated by using the method of Kaplan and Meier.
Prognostic factors for survival were evaluated by the
log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression models
were used to test for independent associations
between survival and clinical-pathologic covariates.

RESULTS
Patient Demographics
The clinical characteristics of the study population
are listed in Table 1. The mean age of the 297
patients in the study population was 53 years (range,
26–76 years). Fifty-one patients (17%) were diagnosed with stage IV EOC. Most cancers were highgrade tumors (73%) of serous histology (58%). The
distribution of stage IV-defining metastatic sites
includes cytologically positive pleural effusions (n 5
33), parenchymal liver (n 5 9), abdominal wall (n 5
3), vagina (n 5 2), vulva (n 5 1), and mediastinal (n
5 1) and supraclavicular lymph nodes (n 5 2). Of all
297 patients, optimal debulking at initial surgery
with residual tumor no more than 1 cm in greatest
dimension was performed in 37%. Optimal surgical
debulking was achieved in 39% of patients with stage
IIIC EOC and 28% in the stage IV group (P 5 .15).
The size of residual disease at initiation of IP therapy
was as follows: none, 67 (23%); microscopic, 89
(30%); less than 1 cm, 114 (38%); and greater than 1
cm, 27 (9%). There was no statistically significant difference in the size of residual disease at initiation of
IP therapy between patients with stage IIIC or stage

patients was 9.1 years (range, 0.57-19.6 years).

Treatment Results
The median survival for patients with stage IIIC disease was 42 months compared with 34 months for
patients with stage IV disease (P 5 .02, Fig. 1). Of the
51 patients with stage IV disease, 48 died of disease,
1 patient died of metachronous pancreatic carcinoma, and 2 patients are alive without evidence of
disease. A univariate analysis for overall survival for
all patients with stage IV disease was performed on
the following parameters: age, grade, histology, size
of residual disease at initiation of IP chemotherapy,
the presence of paclitaxel in the primary regimen,
the presence of platinum in the IP regimen, and
stage IV-defining metastatic disease site (Table 2). Of
all variables, the only significant predictor of survival

with pleural effusions compared with only 5% in
patients with other metastatic sites (P 5 .008). The
median overall survival was 42 months for stage IIIC
patients, 38 months for stage IV patients with pleural
effusions only, and 25 months for patients with other
stage IV-defining disease (P 5 .036, log-rank; P 5 .01,
trend test; Fig. 3). The subgroup of stage IV patients
with no gross residual disease at the time of secondlook assessment had a median overall survival of 41
months, which compares favorably with that
observed in stage IIIC patients with or without gross
residual disease (34 months vs 59 months; P 5 .001,
trend test), respectively. This implies that some stage
IV patients fare better than certain stage IIIC
patients. On multivariate analysis, stage and size of
residual disease at the initiation of IP therapy were
both independent predictors of survival (hazard ratio
[HR] 5 0.67 and 0.56, respectively).
Ten stage IV patients (20%) survived more then 5
years (median age, 49 years; range, 42-57 years, Table
4). The stage IV-defining metastatic sites in the longterm survivor group were as follows: pleural effusion,
7 patients; liver parenchyma, 2; and vagina, 1. Six
patients did not have gross residual disease at the
time of second-look surgical assessment. In the
remaining 4 cases the residual disease was less than
1 cm. Eight patients had poorly differentiated
tumors. Seven patients died of their disease, 1
patient died of secondary pancreatic carcinoma after
172 months’ follow-up, and 2 patients are still alive
with no evidence of disease after 15 years of followup. Of the patients who died of disease in the longterm survivor group, all patients except 1 had near-

in patients with stage IV disease treated with IP
chemotherapy was the presence of gross residual disease at initiation of IP therapy. Median survival for
those stage IV patients receiving IP therapy as consolidation with no gross residual disease was 41
months, and 18 months for those with residual disease at the time of second-look assessment (P 5 .027;

When comparing patients with pleural effusions
to patients with other sites of stage IV-defining metastatic disease, the median overall survival was 38

diagnosis were less likely to have gross residual disease at the time of second-look assessment than
those with other metastatic sites (P 5 .014, Table 3).

DISCUSSION
The prognosis of stage IV epithelial ovarian cancer is
generally poor, and the natural history is often one
of persistent disease or progression after primary
treatment. These circumstances warrant the consideration of alternative therapeutic strategies. Studies
investigating the use of IP chemotherapy in patients
with stage III and IV EOC after second-look assessment have noted prolonged survival in select
patients with minimal residual disease at the time of
second-look assessment.6–8 Recent large, randomized, controlled phase 3 trials of up-front IP chemotherapy for optimally debulked stage III EOC have
shown an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival compared with intravenous
chemotherapy.10–12 Up-front IP therapy in optimally
debulked patients with stage IV EOC is controversial,
however, because its anticipated added benefit
derived from enhanced drug exposure is thought not
applicable to extraperitoneal sites.
This study evaluated patients with stage IV disease treated with IP therapy after second-look assessment. Technical problems with the fully fenestrated
peritoneal catheter were relatively uncommon and
have been reported elsewhere.6 With the exception of
2 patients, all patients with stage IV disease died despite primary surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy followed by IP therapy after second-look
assessment.
The overall survival of patients with stage IV disease in this series is significantly shorter than in
similarly treated patients with stage IIIC disease. In
2002 Barakat et al.6 reported that stage was not a
predictor of long-term survival in patients receiving
IP therapy after second-look assessment. The only
significant predictors of survival were grade and size
of residual disease at initiation of IP therapy. In that
study, 433 patients of all stages who received IP therapy after second-look assessment were included, and
no discrimination had been made between stage
IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC disease. The median patient follow-up was 2.7 years (range, 0.06–13.2 years). In the
present study the median length of follow-up was 3.4
years, and all but 2 patients died in the stage IV
group. The longer follow-up may have contributed to
the statistically significant difference in survival
when comparing stages IIIC and IV. These results
support the FIGO staging system and other data stating that the survival of patients with stage IV disease

2695

remains worse than stage IIIC disease.14,26 Previous
reports, such as the study by Eitan et al,26 have also
shown that survival of stage IV patients with optimally debulked EOC based on pleural effusions only
is significantly worse than the survival of patients
with optimally debulked stage IIIC disease. One
explanation suggested for the survival difference in
that study is the presence of undetected bulky intrathoracic disease.
In this study we looked at several prognostic factors for stage IV disease and found that the size of
residual disease at initiation of IP therapy is the only
determinant of long-term survival. Median survival
for those stage IV patients receiving IP therapy as
consolidation with no gross residual disease was 41
months, and 18 months for those with residual disease at the time of second-look assessment. Thus,
patients who failed to respond to primary intravenous therapy by evidence of bulky disease at the
time of second-look reassessment did not benefit
from further IP chemotherapy.
From the data it appears that the site of stage
IV-defining disease may also play a role in outcome
after IP therapy. When comparing survival for
patients with pleural effusions to patients with other
sites of metastasis, the difference did not reach statistical significance. However, when both groups of
stage IV patients (with or without pleural effusions)
are compared with similarly treated stage IIIC
patients, there was a significant trend for improved
survival in those patients with pleural effusions only.
Interestingly, the median survival of stage IV patients
with pleural effusions was more similar to those with
stage IIIC disease than stage IV patients with visceral
or other stage IV-defining metastasis. The trend test
suggests that the site of metastasis may be an important determinant of survival. These findings are supported by the outcome of the long-term stage IV
survivors in this study. Near-death findings in longterm stage IV survivors defined by pleural effusions
who subsequently died of the disease all had extensive hepatobiliary disease, which may support the
use of regional therapy in this ‘favorable’ group of
stage IV patients. In other words, these patients died
of intraabdominal disease, the target of IP therapy,
and not distant spread.
In this analysis the median survival of 34 months
for all patients with stage IV disease was longer than
that shown in other series. Bonnefoi et al.14 reported
a median survival of 13.4 months and a 5-year survival rate of 7.6%. Naik et al.13 reported a median
survival of 11 months and a 5-year survival of 9%.
Several factors could have accounted for this relatively favorable outcome. The majority of these

2696

CANCER

patients (n 5 277, 93%) were in clinical remission after primary surgery and initial intravenous chemotherapy. Also, our study population is relatively
young (median age, 51 years) when compared with
the other series. Recent studies have investigated the
relationship between age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer and prognosis. A recent retrospective analysis of
a large group of patients with stage III EOC who
received primary cytoreduction and intravenous platinum and paclitaxel chemotherapy during participation in a Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)27 trial
confirmed that age was an independent predictor of
prognosis. Whereas this outcome in our study may
be explained by the inclusion of only a highly
selected, mostly favorable group of stage IV patients
(ie, those in clinical remission, young and healthy
enough to undergo second-look reassessment and IP
chemotherapy), it nonetheless raises the possibility
that more favorable survival is an achievable goal in
a subpopulation of patients with stage IV disease.
Another important difference between this series and
others is that the majority of patients (64%) had malignant pleural effusions as their stage IV-defining
site of disease.
In our series, patients with stage IV who were
treated with primary cytoreduction and intravenous
chemotherapy and who were subsequently treated
with IP therapy had a better median overall survival
if no gross residual disease was found at second-look
laparotomy. Drugs delivered by the IP route penetrate only a depth of a few millimeters beneath the
tumor surface.28–30 Thus, patients with small-volume
residual disease benefit most from this approach.
Although randomized trials evaluating the role of
consolidation strategies have not demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of overall survival,
they have suggested that these strategies are most
effective for patients who have responded to primary
therapy.31–35 Undoubtedly, there are methodological
issues that may not permit generalization of these
findings to contemporary patients. The heterogeneity
of treatment strategies throughout the study period
makes it difficult to account for differences in treatment regimens used during and after IP consolidation therapy. These findings are also limited by a
long study period. During this time period, both the
standard chemotherapy agents and surgical techniques have improved. Cyclophosphamide and cisplatin are no longer the standard agents used for
treating primary EOC. Surgical technique, instrumentation, and approach have all improved as evidenced
by the current optimal cytoreduction rate at this
institution, which is near 80%, compared with only
37% in the reported series.36

In conclusion, the survival of patients diagnosed
with stage IV EOC continues to be short, and even in
this ‘favorable’ group selected for IP therapy after
achieving a clinical remission, only 2 patients survived. Whereas new approaches are undoubtedly
needed, identification of a group of patients with
stage IV disease who may benefit from IP consolidation is warranted. Optimal cytoreduction rates may
prove helpful in enhancing survival rates even for
stage IV patients, and certain subsets may benefit
from implementation of strategies heretofore thought
applicable only to stage III patients. Because stage IV
patients all receive intravenous therapy, consolidation IP therapy may offer an opportunity to extend
the benefits of the IP route to a population with a
historically poor outcome.
