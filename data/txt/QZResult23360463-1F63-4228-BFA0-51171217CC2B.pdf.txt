ABSTRACT
Recently, we found that NHE9 mRNA was upregulated in chemoradiotherapy
(CRT)-resistant esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC); however, the underlying
mechanisms were unclear. Here, we aimed to clarify the functional contribution
of NHE9 to CRT resistance, understand the molecular basis of NHE9-dependent
resistance in ESCC, and identify potential therapeutic targets. Our results showed
that NHE9 prevented CRT-induced apoptosis. Importantly, we found that RACK1 is a
novel binding partner of NHE9 and that NHE9-dependent induction of CRT resistance
requires the activation of RACK1-associated Src/Akt/β-catenin signaling. Moreover,
upregulated Bcl-2 protein was also observed in cells exhibiting NHE9-induced CRT
resistance. A higher NHE9 level was associated with a poor response to CRT and less
decrease in T and N stage in ESCC patients. Furthermore, combining either Dasatinib
or ABT-737 with CRT significantly reduced tumor volume, and the response to CRT
was restored when these inhibitors were used together with CRT in a xenograft nude
mouse model with NHE9 overexpression. Taken together, our findings demonstrate
that NHE9 can be an effective predictor of CRT response and may be useful in the
development of targeted therapies for CRT-resistant ESCC.

only gene in this group that was significantly upregulated:
its level in the responder group was two-fold higher than
that in the nonresponder group. Therefore, it is possible that
NHE9 is involved in regulating the response of ESCC to
CRT; however, this requires further investigation.
NHE9, which belongs to the Na+/H+ exchanger
superfamily, localizes on late recycling endosomes
and maintains cation and volume homeostasis through
electroneutral exchange of protons for Na (+) across
membranes [6]. Members of the NHE family contain a
long intracellular C-terminus that may interact with various
proteins, such as calcineurin-homologous proteins (CHP1
and CHP2) [7, 8], receptor for activated kinase C (RACK1)
[9, 10], calmodulin (CaM) [10, 11], and PIP2 [12], all of
which play key roles in regulating cell function via various

INTRODUCTION
Currently, it is clear that neoadjuvant chemora­
diotherapy (CRT) can improve the outcome of esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) [1, 2]. However, only
responders benefit from CRT, whereas nonresponders
may suffer a worse prognosis [3, 4]. Therefore, it is
very important to explore the key markers and relevant
subcellular processes affecting the CRT response. We
previously conducted a microarray study using mRNA
extracted from tumor tissue obtained from ESCC patents
via endoscopic biopsy before CRT to examine differences
in gene expression between responders and nonresponders
[5]. Among the differentially expressed genes, the NHE9
gene, which is implicated in endocytic recycling, was the

signaling pathways. Nevertheless, the interactions between
NHE9 and these proteins have not been confirmed. NHE9
was reported to be associated with autism susceptibility
and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [13, 14].
Currently, the exact role of NHE9 in the CRT response
of ESCC has not yet been determined, and despite the
expression difference, the mechanism underlying NHE9
involvement in CRT resistance is unclear. However,
considering the many potential interacting proteins, NHE9
could alter signaling pathways and ultimately cause ESCC
cells to become resistant to CRT.
A growing body of evidence has shown that aberrant
activation/sequestration of signaling pathways such as PI3K/
Akt [15–17], MAPK [18, 19], and TP53 [20, 21] is correlated
with the inhibition of apoptosis that is often observed in
cancers with acquired resistance to treatment [16, 22, 23],
[24, 25]. Several potential binding partners of the NHE
family, including RACK1, CHP1, CHP2, CaM and PIP2,
participate in regulating apoptosis-related cellular processes
and in establishing crosstalk between intrinsic and extrinsic
apoptotic pathways [24–28]. For example, RACK1 acts as an
IGF-1R-interacting protein to activate Src/Akt and promote
cell survival [29]. Additionally, CHP1 and CHP2 can
respectively activate and inhibit the phosphatase activity
of calcineurin [28], which induces apoptosis by enhancing
BAD heterodimerization with Bcl-xl [30]. Therefore,
NHE9 may regulate the response to CRT by interacting
with key factors in various cellular processes. In this study,
we explored the possible functions and corresponding

mechanisms of the NHE9-regulated response to CRT
in ESCC, and sought potential therapies that may offset
NHE9-induced resistance.

RESULTS
NHE9 increases CRT resistance in ESCC cell lines
We examined the expression of NHE9 in ten ESCC
cell lines (Fig. S1), and we selected Eca109 and KYSE30,
which have relatively low levels of intrinsic NHE9, to
establish stable overexpression lines (Eca109/NHE9 and
KYSE30/NHE9). Inversely, KYSE520 and KYSE180,
with relatively high levels of intrinsic NHE9, were used
to generate stable knockdown cell lines (KYSE520/
sh1, KYSE520/sh2; KYSE180/sh1, KYSE180/sh2).
Subsequently, the efficiency of overexpression and
knockdown was confirmed by real-time PCR and western
blotting (Fig. 1A–1B). Additionally, the overexpression
of NHE9 was also confirmed by an immunofluorescence
assay (Fig. 1C). GFP-fused NHE9 was mainly localized
on the membranes of endosomes and in the cytoplasm,
whereas the control GFP protein was dispersed throughout
the cytoplasm and nucleus.
Both the overexpression and knockdown cell lines
were treated with cisplatin or vinorelbine to study the
possible function of NHE9 in regulating the response to
chemotherapy. A series of 17 drug concentrations, ranging
from 25 μg/ml to 3.9 × 10−4 μg/ml, were established using

Figure 1: NHE9 overexpression or knockdown cell lines. NHE9 was stably overexpressed in Eca109 and KYSE30 cells; NHE9
was stably knocked down in KYSE520 and KYSE180 cells; A. The efficiency of overexpression and knockdown was re-examined by realtime qPCR B. Subcellular localization of GFP-fused NHE9 compared with control GFP protein in Eca109 cells C.

the double ratio dilution method and utilized to calculate
the IC50 dose of cisplatin or vinorelbine in each cell line.
The results showed that the IC50 doses of both drugs
were significantly higher in the NHE9-overexpressing
cells than in the corresponding controls; inversely, NHE9
knockdown obviously reduced the IC50 dose of both
cisplatin and vinorelbine (Fig. 2A). The IC50 doses of
cisplatin and vinorelbine for each cell line and the relevant
P values are listed in Table 1.
An X-ray survival assay was performed on both
overexpression and knockdown cell lines to examine
the possible regulatory effect of NHE9 on the response
to radiotherapy. Colonies were counted two weeks after
x-ray radiation (Fig. 2B). Fewer colonies were observed in
NHE9 knockdown cell lines compared with the controls;
in contrast, NHE9-overexpressing cell lines formed more
colonies than the controls. KYSE180 was more sensitive
to radiation because this cell line formed fewer colonies
that were smaller in size compared with other ESCC cell
lines treated with the same X-ray dose.

the growth curves, xenograft tumor sizes, and migration
ability were compared between NHE9-overexpressing cells
and control cells. Unfortunately, no apparent differences
were observed in the cell growth curves (Fig. S2A), and
the tumor volume was similar between Eca109/NHE and
Eca109/Con grafts (Fig. S2B). Additionally, NHE9 did not
exhibit effects on cell migration in a wound-healing assay
(Fig. S2C).
To study the mechanism underlying NHE9induced CRT resistance, we further tested whether the
overexpression of NHE9 was correlated with decreased
susceptibility to apoptosis induced by chemotherapy and/
or radiotherapy. Flow cytometry was used to quantify cell
apoptosis after cisplatin, vinorelbine or X-ray treatment.
Obviously, Eca109/NHE9 and KYSE30/NHE9 cells
exhibited significantly lower rates of apoptosis after
anti-cancer drug or X-ray treatments compared with the
controls, whereas NHE9 knockdown cell lines displayed
a higher apoptosis rate (Fig. 3A–3C).
Furthermore, the effect of NHE9 on apoptosisrelated pathways was tested by western blotting,
and the results revealed that NHE9 could inhibit
CRT-induced apoptosis. The levels of cleaved-PARP
and cleaved-caspase-3 in Eca109/NHE9 and KYSE30/
NHE9 cells were much lower than those in the controls
after chemotherapy and X-ray treatments (Fig. 3D).
These  findings suggest that NHE9 induces CRT
resistance by inhibiting cell apoptosis.

NHE9 inhibits CRT-induced apoptosis
Although NHE9 was found to be capable of
regulating the response of ESCC to CRT, the underlying
mechanism was unclear. To abolish CRT resistance in
patients with higher NHE9 expression, it is important to
first identify the functional role of NHE9 in the response
to CRT. We initially hypothesized that NHE9 might
enhance CRT resistance by promoting cell proliferation
and/or metastasis. This hypothesis was based on
immunohistochemistry (IHC) results indicating that NHE9positive cells were mostly observed in tumors, in the
basal epithelium, and around microvessels. Subsequently,

partner of NHE9 in ESCC

mechanisms by which NHE9, an ion channel, affects
apoptosis are unknown. NHE9 is known to contain
binding sites in its intracellular C-terminus for many
molecules; therefore, we hypothesized that NHE9 might
play a role in apoptosis through its binding partners.
A pull-down assay was performed using the C-terminus
of NHE9 (generated via prokaryotic expression) fused
to GST-Sepharose and Eca109 cell lysates. The protein
complex was further analyzed by SELDI-TOF-MS, and
4 potential interacting proteins, including Homo sapiens
glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1), leucine-rich repeat
and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing receptorinteracting protein 4 (LIGO4), polycystin-1 (PKD1), and
receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) (Fig. 4A), were
identified.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

All four of the potential binding proteins were
further identified by co-immunoprecipitation followed
by western blotting; however, only RACK1 could be
confirmed as a binding partner of the NHE9 C-terminus.
Immunoprecipitation of NHE9 and RACK1 was applied
to further confirm this result (Fig. 4B–4D).

NHE9 inhibits apoptosis by activating Src/Akt/
β-catenin signaling
Interestingly, we found that the interaction
between NHE9 and RACK1 was altered after the cells
were treated with cisplatin, vinorelbine or X-rays. The
immunoprecipitation results showed that the binding
of NHE9 to RACK1 was relatively weaker after

β-catenin [31, 32]. To determine whether Akt/GSK3β/
β-catenin was involved in NHE9-induced CRT resistance,
the expression levels and phosphorylation states of
GSK3β and β-catenin were evaluated. The results
revealed a significant increase in Akt phosphorylation
with concomitant upregulation of GSK3β and β-catenin
in a cell model with NHE9 overexpression-induced
CRT resistance (Fig. 5C). Phosphorylated Akt was also
suggested to be capable of upregulating Bcl-2 [33, 34],
a potent anti-apoptotic molecule. Thus, we subsequently
examined the expression of Bcl-2. Increased expression
of Bcl-2 was detected in NHE9-overexpressing cells,
which is reflective of resistance to treatment; inversely,
relatively lower expression of Bcl-2 was found in
NHE9 knockdown cells (Fig. 5D). Collectively, our
data indicate that NHE9 might induce CRT resistance
by upregulating Src/Akt/β-catenin pathway and Bcl-2
protein expression.

chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and a similar result
was observed after X-ray treatment (Fig. 5A and 5B).
Therefore, CRT may negatively affect the binding between
NHE9 and RACK1. Additionally, NHE9 may affect cell
signaling activation by interacting with RACK1.
Because RACK1 downregulats cell apoptosis
by regulating Src/Akt activity, we first examined the
activation states of Src and Akt after anti-cancer treatment
or X-ray treatment in NHE9-overexpressing and NHE9
knockdown cells. The western blot results showed that
higher levels of phosphorylated Src (Tyr 416) and higher
levels of phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) were detected in
NHE9-overexpressing cells, whereas lower levels of
phosphorylated Src and Akt were observed in NHE9
knockdown cells (Fig. 5C).
We further evaluated the states of the downstream
targets of Src/Akt. Activated Akt can phosphorylate
and inactivate GSK3β, leading to the activation of

use of targeted inhibitors significantly reduced tumor
volume (Fig. 6). The volume of Eca109/NHE-formed
grafts was reduced after treatment with Dasatinib plus
chemotherapy or ABT-737 plus chemotherapy compared
to chemotherapy alone; moreover, the response to CRT was
restored when applying two inhibitors-plus-chemotherapy
treatment in Eca109/NHE-formed grafts. The combined
targeted-therapy had similar therapeutic effects in the group
exposed to X-ray radiation.
HE staining revealed a malignant phenotype,
and IHC staining confirmed the expression of NHE9,
phosphorylated Src, and Bcl-2. Histologic analysis
revealed that tumor xenografts displayed the ESCC
phenotype, and IHC staining showed increased expression
of NHE9 in Eca109/NHE cells. Src phosphorylation and
Bcl-2 expression were largely inhibited after treatment
with Dasatinib and ABT-737 (Fig. 7).
We concluded that NHE9-induced CRT resistance
required Src/Akt/β-catenin activation and Bcl-2

Given that the aberrant activation of Src/Akt/
β-catenin and the upregulation of Bcl-2 were considered
to be involved in NHE9-induced CRT resistance in ESCC,
we attempted to weaken the resistance by applying the
relevant targeted inhibitors to decrease the activation
of Src and Bcl-2. Dasatinib and ABT-737 are targeted
inhibitors that are widely used for inhibiting Src and
Bcl-2 activation, respectively, in basic research and
clinical trials [35–38]. Therefore, a combination therapy
including Dasatinib, ABT-737 and chemotherapy
(consisting of cisplatin and vinorelbine) was applied in a
nude mouse xenograft model to test its therapeutic effect
on tumor grafts with NHE9-induced CRT resistance.
The therapeutic effect of a combined regimen including
Dasatinib, ABT-737 and X-ray radiation was also tested.
No incidental death was observed during the

(Fig. S3). Patients with a staining score of no more than
5 were placed in the “low expression” group, and the
remaining patients were placed in the “high expression”
group.
According to the cut-off value described above,
high NHE9 expression was observed in 48 of 76
(63.16%) patients. The results of a Chi-square test
revealed that higher NHE9 levels were associated with
a poor pathological complete response (P < 0.001) and
less changes in the T (P = 0.045) or N (P = 0.039) stage
after CRT; however, no significant correlations were
observed between the NHE9 expression level and other
patient characteristics, including age, gender, BMI, tumor
location, clinical stage, and lymph node stage change
(Table 2).

NHE9 expression and CRT response in
ESCC patients
To determine the clinical relevance of NHE9
expression, we extended our analysis to an additional
105 ESCC patients who received the same regimen of
neoadjuvant concurrent CRT described above. At the time
of evaluation, a pathological complete response (pCR)
and a non-pathological complete response (non-pCR)
were achieved in 45 and 60 patients, respectively, with a
therapeutic response rate of 42.9%. After CRT, all cases
underwent esophagectomy performed by surgery teams
supervised by experienced esophageal surgeons at Sun
Yat-sen University Cancer Center.
An immunohistochemical assay was utilized to
detect the expression of NHE9 in endoscopic biopsy
samples before CRT. Results were obtained from
76 samples (samples could not be obtained from
26 patients, and inconclusive results were obtained
from 3 slides). A total of 48 of the 76 patients showed
strong positive staining (a score of 6–7), 22 patients
showed moderate positive staining (a score of 3–5), and
6 patients showed weak positive staining (a score of 0–2).
Positive immunoreactivity for NHE9 protein was mainly
detected in the tumor cytoplasm; however, positive
staining was also occasionally observed in the basal
layer of the normal esophageal epithelium (Fig. 8A–8D).
Interestingly, strong positive staining was observed around
microvessels, which might suggest a link between NHE9
and the tumor microenvironment.
We performed ROC curve analysis to develop
a reasonable cut-off value for high NHE9 expression

DISCUSSION
In this study, we uncovered an oncogenic role for
NHE9. NHE9 overexpression enhanced the resistance of
ESCC cells to apoptosis induced by cisplatin, vinorelbine
or X-ray treatment. Conversely, NHE9 knockdown
resulted in increased sensitivity to these therapies. In
addition, the oncogenic function of NHE9 was further
explored in a nude mouse xenograft model. We found
that the overexpression of NHE9 induces CRT resistance
in ESCC by upregulating the Src/Akt/β-catenin pathway
and Bcl-2 expression. Inhibition of Src and Bcl-2 largely
abolished the CRT resistance induced by NHE9. Taken
together, these findings demonstrate that NHE9 may be
an effective predictor of the response to CRT. Knowledge
about NHE9 provides promising clues for enhancing
CRT sensitivity in ESCC. These findings have significant
clinical relevance.

Consistent with the experimental data in vitro and
in vivo, higher expression of NHE9 was correlated with a
poor CRT response and less decrease in T and N stage in
ESCC patients, which further confirmed that NHE9 is a
predictor of CRT resistance and ultimately poor survival.
Therefore, knowledge about the expression level of NHE9
may help medical oncologists to select the best candidates
for CRT.
RACK1 was identified as a binding partner of NHE9
in ESCC cells. Although the mechanism underlying the
involvement of NHE9 in tumors was unclear, previous
studies established an important role for RACK1 in cancer
cell apoptosis [25, 27, 39, 40], which led us to investigate
the possibility that NHE9 induced CRT resistance by
affecting the RACK1-associated apoptosis pathway.
Because RACK1 could affect cell apoptosis by regulating
Src/Akt activity, we examined Src and Akt kinase activity
under conditions of high or low NHE9 expression.
Interestingly, we found that the interaction between
NHE9 and RACK1 might be involved in CRT resistance.
The binding affinity of NHE9 for RACK1 was much
weaker after chemotherapy or radiation. Additionally,
overexpression of NHE9 induced the upregulation of
the Src/Akt/β-catenin pathway and Bcl-2 expression.
Therefore, we presumed that an increase in the level of
NHE9 protein might contribute to resistance by restoring
the interaction between NHE9 and RACK1 and finally
upregulating Src/Akt/β-catenin and Bcl-2.
Apoptosis is a pivotal mechanism in CRT-induced
cell death. The balance among members of the Bcl-2
family of proteins determines the susceptibility of cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to a death signal in the intrinsic pathway [41]. Consistent
with previous studies, the expression of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, was upregulated in
cells exhibiting NHE9-overexpression-induced resistance
to CRT. Src phosphorylation at Tyr416 was also identified
in ESCC cells overexpressing NHE9. Phosphorylation of
Tyr416 in the kinase domain upregulates enzyme activity
and subsequently triggers a series of downstream kinase
activation events, such as activation of Akt. The abnormal
activation of Akt is an important mechanism underlying
chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer [42], ovarian
cancer [43], ESCC [44, 45], and lung cancer [46, 47].
Akt is activated by phosphorylation at Ser473 within
its carboxy terminus, and it plays a role in cell survival
by activating GSK-3β and downstream β-catenin.
Upregulation of Bcl-2 expression and Src phosphorylation
was also clearly observed in IHC images of Eca109/NHE9
nude mouse xenografts. To the best of our knowledge, our
study is the first to reveal an oncogenic role for NHE9 and
to elucidate the mechanism of CRT resistance in ESCC
patients with increased NHE9 expression. Thus, Src/Akt/
β-catenin and Bcl-2 might be effective therapeutic targets
in ESCC patients with NHE9 expression-induced CRT
resistance.
In the present study, we attempted to weaken the
CRT resistance triggered by NHE9 expression by applying
two targeted agents. Dasatinib, a Src kinase inhibitor, has
been shown to be effective in treating solid tumors, such
as thyroid cancer [48]. The Bcl-2 family inhibitor ABT737 can effectively reduce chemotherapy resistance in
breast cancer [49, 50]. Thus, we performed experiments

continuous i.v. drip for 48 hr on days 1, 8, 22 and 29. All
patients received external beam radiotherapy by 6–8 MV
linear accelerators. Two-dimensional or three-dimensional
treatment plans using computed tomography scans were
made. The initial treatment included the primary tumor and
enlarged lymph nodes. For primary tumor, a radial margin
of 1.5 cm and a proximal and distant margin of 3–4 cm
were applied. A total radiation dose of 40 Gy (2 Gy/fraction,
5 days a week) was delivered with the three-field technique.
The effect of CRT was evaluated clinically for
primary lesions based on esophagography and CT scan
4  weeks after CRT according to the following criteria:
pCR was defined as the complete resolution of all
assessable lesions. Otherwise, the patients were classified
as non-pCR group. All these conditions had to last for at
least 4 weeks and no appearance of new lesions.
Six to eight weeks after chemoradiotherapy, all
patients received the right-approach tri-incisinal videoassistant thoracoscopic R0 esophagectomy with two-field
systemic lymphadenectomy and cervical lymph node
sampling. The alimentary tract was reconstructed using the
gastric pull-up technique. The sites of the lymph nodes
were identified by the surgeons during the operation.
The patients were followed every month for the first
3 month, every 3 months for the first year and then every
6 months for the next 2 years and finally annually. The
diagnostic examinations consisted of esophagography, CT,
chest X-ray, blood tumor biomarker test, and bone scan
when necessary to detect recurrence and/or metastasis.

to assess the therapeutic effects of these two targeted
drugs on CRT resistance in ESCC. The results showed that
Src phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression were largely
inhibited by the targeted inhibitors. Combining CRT with
targeted-therapy with a single inhibitor led to an increased
response to CRT in ESCC with higher NHE9 expression.
Furthermore, the CRT response of grafts overexpressing
NHE9 was restored when both targeted inhibitors were
applied together with CRT. Currently, the application of
targeted medication in ESCC is still in its infancy, and
combined treatments including targeted drugs and CRT
may be the best approach for extending patient survival.
We hope to provide evidence for further clinical phase
I trials of targeted therapies for ESCC.
In summary, this study provides not only new
insights into the mechanisms of CRT resistance in ESCC
but also clues regarding the application of new targeted
agents in CRT-resistant ESCC patients. It is possible that
NHE9 may weaken the response to CRT through other
mechanisms aside from those described in this study;
thus, further investigations should be carried out to better
clarify the mechanisms underlying NHE9-induced CRT
resistance with the aim of achieving a higher pathological
response rate and better patient prognosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and tissue specimens
In accordance with the patient selecting criteria of
microarray assay, another set of 105 patients diagnosed
with stage II – III ESCC and undertook neoadjuvant
concurrent CRT were consecutively selected from
the department of Thoracic surgery, the Sun Yat-sen
University Cancer Center. All the cases were selected
based on availability of biopsy specimens and follow-up
data. Patients included were without previous treatment,
adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, malignant
disease or a second primary tumor. All of the tumor
samples from patients in this study were endoscopic
biopsy specimens obtained before CRT. The preoperative
workup was evaluated by endoscopy with biopsy and
histological examination, barium esophagography to
confirm tumor location, thoracic and abdominal computed
tomography (CT) and cervical ultrasonography (with
biopsy if indicated) if cervical lymph node metastasis was
suspected. Endoscopic ultrasonography was performed
routinely. All patients signed written informed consent
before operation. The study was approved by the medical
ethics committee of Sun Yat-sen University research
institutes, Guangzhou, China.
All of the patients received the same concurrent
CRT with the cisplatin / vinorelbine regimen. Cisplatin
was administered as an i.v. drip at dose of 75 mg/m 2 on
day 1 and 22; vinorelbine 25 g/m 2 was administered as a

Immunohistochemistry
IHC analysis was performed to examine NHE9
expression levels in endoscopic biopsy ESCC samples and
nude mice graft tumor. Primary antibodies against NHE9
(1:200 dilution, anti-Rabbit, Abcam), phosphor-Src (Tyr416,
1:50 dilution, anti-rabbit, Cell signaling), and Bcl-2 (1:200
dilution, anti-rabbit, Cell signaling) were used in this study.
NHE9 does not have any different isoform. Normal rabbit
IgG-B (1:50 dilution, Santa) was used as negative control.
HRP anti-rabbit/mouse antibody was used as secondary
antibody (Dako). The intensity of IHC staining in the tumor
cells was scored independently by two pathologists by
using semiquantitative IRS (immunoreactive score) scale
according to Remmele and Stegner [51]. The intensity of
positive staining was scored according to the mean optical
density method [52]:0, no staining; 1, weak staining (light
yellow); 2, moderate staining (yellow brown); and 3, strong
staining (brown). Positive tumor cell staining was assigned
a score using a semiquantitative five-category grading
system: 0, < 5% positive cells; 1, 5–25%; 2, 26–50%; 3,
51–75%; 4, 76–100%. The two individual parameters were
added, resulting in an IRS ranging from 0 to 7. The value
was selected until at least two pathologists reported
consistent results.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
analysis was performed to determine cutoff score for
NHE9 “high expression”. Tumors classified as low
expression of NHE9 were those with the scores below or
equal to the cutoff value, while tumors of high expression
were those with scores above the value.

NHE9 overexpression and control cell line; pSUPER.
retro-shNHE9 and pSUPER.retro vector were used to
produce retrovirus and then constructed stable NHE9
knocking down and control cell lines. Packaging of
viruses was performed by transient transfection of 293FT
cells with a transfer plasmid and pik packaging vector.
Seventy-two hours after transfection, the retrovirus
particles were collected and filtered, then concentrated
by ultracentrifugation at 50, 000 g for 2.5 hr at 4ºC.
Subsequently, we infected the esophageal cancer cell
lines Eca109, KYSE30, KYSE180 and KYSE520 with
the retrovirus in 6-well plates. 48 hours after infection,
DMEM medium with 1.5ug/ml puromycin was applied to
select the successful transfected cells. The overexpression
or knockdown efficiency of NHE9 was examined by realtime qPCR and Western blotting.

RNA extraction, reverse transcription and
real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from ESCC cell lines
using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The
extracted RNA was dissolved with RNAase-free water,
and 1ug RNA from each sample was used for cDNA
synthesis primed with random hexamers. Real-time PCR
was performed using a Roche 480 fast real-time system
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to determine the
expression pattern of NHE9 mRNA in each of the cell
lines. Expression data were normalized to the geometric
mean of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehydes
3—phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The first strand
cDNA products were amplified with GAPDH-specific
(F: 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′ and
R: 5‘-TC TAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′) and
NHE9-specific (F: 5′-TTGCAATGGGGTCTGCGTAT-3′
and R: 5′-TTCCAGCATCGGGAACTCAC-3′) primers by
PCR. The knockdown or overexpression efficiency was
also evaluated.

Transient transfection
RACK1, CHP1, CHP2, GSTp1, LIGO4, and PKD1
cDNA was cloned into pcDNA6/myc-HisB vector and
transfected to produce overexpression cell lines. The
KYSE30/NHE9 and Eca109/NHE9 cells were prepared
for RACK1 transfection.

Western blotting analysis
Protein samples were resolved by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred
on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pall Corp., Port
Washington, NY). The samples were then incubated with
primary antibodies against NHE9 (1:800 dilution, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA), GAPDH (1:5000 dilution, KangChen,
Shanghai), β-actin (1:1000 dilution, Cell signaling),
Caspase 3 (1:1000 dilution, Cell signaling), phosphor-Akt
(1:1000 dilution, Cell signaling), phosphor-Src (Tyr416,
1:1000 dilution, Cell signaling), PARP (1:1000 dilution,
Cell signaling), β-catenin (1:1000 dilution, BD), pGSK3β
(1:1000 dilution, Cell signaling), Bcl-2 (1:1000 dilution,
Cell signaling), Flag-tag (1:1000 dilution, Sigma),
c-Myc (1:200 dilution, Santa), normal mouse IgG (1:200
dilution, Santa). The secondary antibodies used were
ECLTM anti-mouse IgG (1:2500 dilution, GE healthcare)
and ECLTM anti-rabbit IgG (1:2500 dilution, GE
healthcare). The immunoreactive signals were detected
with enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham
Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). The procedures followed
were conducted in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Plasmids
A complete protein coding region (CDS) of human
NHE9 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen)
using EcoRI and Xho I sites. Subcloning was conducted
into pMSCVpuro (Clontech) for stable transfection.
A flag tag was added after NHE9 for immunoprecipitation
assay. C-terminal of NHE9 was clone into pGEX-6p-1
(GE Healthcare), for protein prokaryotic expression
and following pull-down assay. pEGFP-C2-NHE9 was
constructed for fluorescein observation, using pEGFP
vector (Clontech). The shRNA sequences targeted NHE9
are listed as following:, (1) GCTCTTCAGAATGTGGTAT

ATACCACATTCTGAAGAGCCG; (2)
ATCGTCATAGGGTTAATTA
(loop)
TAATTAACCCTATGACGATGC.
pSUPER.retro
vector (Oligoengine) was used for construction of
short interfering RNA. Packaging plasmid pik (Langri
biotechnology, Guangzhou) was used in virus construction.
The complete CDS regime of human RACK1, GSTP1,
LIGO4, PKD1 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA6/myc-HisB
(Invitrogen) for co-immunoprecipitation assay.

X-ray survival assay
Cells were dispensed in 6-wells cell culture dishes
at a density of 1 × 10 3 cells. After 24 h incubation, they
were irradiated with x-ray (6 J/m 2, x-ray irradiation was
carried out using x-ray machine for research only), and the

cultures were maintained until the surviving cells formed
colonies. The colonies that survived after incubation were
then stained with crystal violet, counted, and relative
colony numbers were obtained.
2 × 105 cells (cover 50% area of the dish) were
cultured in 60mm dish for 24 hours, and then irradiated
with x-ray (6 J/m 2). The cells were collected after 48 hours
for study of protein and mRNA expression alteration.

10 cm) was added to the resin. After incubation for 1 h at
4°C, the resin was washed 6 times with PBS, and bound
proteins were eluted with sample buffer and analyzed
by SDS-PAGE. The positive results were analyzed with
surface- enhanced laserdesorption/ionization – time
of flight – mass spectrometry (SELDI- TOF- MS) to
detect the proteins. The same sample also prepared for
western blotting identification using the corresponding
antibodies.

Chemotherapy resistance assay

Immunoprecipitation

To assess chemosensitivity to anti-cancer drugs,
cells were dispensed in 96-well plates at a density about
3 × 103 cells per well and incubated with a range of
different concentrations of cisplatin or vinorelbine for
72 hours. Cell viability values were assessed by the MTT
(3- (4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide, inner salt) method (Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One
Solution Cell Proliferation Assay solution; Promega,
Madison, WI). Spectrometric absorbance at wavelength of
570 nm and 655 nm were measured on a microplate reader
(Bio-Rad). Cell viability was evaluated with the value of
[A570-A655 (drug+)/A570-A655 (drug-)] × 100%.
2 × 105 cells (cover 50% area of the dish) were
cultured in 6-well cell culture dishes for 24 hours, and then
they were treated with cisplatin (1 ug/ml) or vinorelbine
(1.5 × 10−2ug/ml) for 48 hours. The cells were collected
for studying protein and mRNA expression changes.

1 x 108 NHE9 stable transfectants or mock controls
were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM,
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 10ug/ml aprotinin,
10 ug/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-Flag beads
(Sigma) or anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotecnology)
or control normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotecnology).
The immune complex was precipitated using Protein-A/
G-agarose beads (when using anti-Myc or normal mouse
IgG in IP) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The blot was then
probed with anti-FLAG (Sigma) or anti-Myc antibodies
(Santa Cruz Biotecnology), respectively.

Nude mice xenograft models
The orthotropic nude mice esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma model was established with human
esophageal cancer cell Eca109/NHE and Eca109/Con.
106 cells in 150 ul of culture medium were subcutaneously
injected into the left (Eca109/NHE) or right flank (Eca109/
Con) of five-week old female nu/nu mice maintaining in
standard SPF conditions. When tumor volume reached
approximately 300 mm3, the long and short diameter of
each graft tumor were recorded and tumor volume was
quantified with the value of L*W2/2 (L, long diameter; W,
short diameter).
The first time cisplatin + vinorelbine intraperitoneal
injection started when tumor volume reach 300 mm3. The
dosage for mice was calculated using HD/HBSA*MBSA
(HD, human dosage; HBSA, human body surface
area; MBSA, mouse body surface area). So cisplatin+
vinorelbine were injected every five days, 4 times, with
a dose of 0.04 mg/20g (5.78mg/m2) and 0.02 mg/20 g
(2.9 mg/m2); meanwhile 0.9% normal saline was injected
as negative control. Dasatinib (Selleck, S1021 or ABT-737
(Selleck, S1002) was injected 0.4 mg/20 g in 0.1ml PBS
intraperitoneal in combination with cisplatin and vinorelbine.
Combined therapy of Dasatinib+ ABT-737 was performed
by injecting a mix of 0.4 mg/20 g of each inhibitor. No less
than 5 mice were performed for each group.
The x-ray radiation (6 J/m2) was performed when
tumor volume reach 500 mm3. Mice holder was used
during radiation. The tumor was well exposed, while
other part of mice body was carefully protected using

Flow cytometry
To quantify the apoptotic cells, the occurrence of
apoptosis was determined by staining cells with both
annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium
iodide (PI). The apoptosis assay was conducted using
the protocol according to manufacturer’s instructions
(BioVision, Milpitas, CA). Fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) was performed with a Beckman Dickinson
FACSort apparatus and used to quantitate the apoptotic
population based on DNA levels.

Pulldown assay
NHE9 c-terminal (NHE9c) was expressed as a
complex of a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused
human SLC9A9. Recombinant proteins fused with GST
binding protein were expressed in BL21 Star (DE3)
cells. The protein complex was induced with isopropylβ-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and purified with
glutathione-Sepharose (Sigma). Bacterial from 500 ml
of LB-medium (MP biomedicals, LLC) culture were
sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatant was
applied to an amylose resin column equilibrated with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for
30 min at room temperature. The resin was washed
3 times with PBS, and cell lysate of Eca109 (10 dishes,
