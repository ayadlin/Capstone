Abstract
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) have multifaceted roles in tumor development but they have been
associated particularly closely with tumor angiogenesis. However, although the accumulation of TAM (M2
phenotype) promotes tumor angiogenesis, the mechanism through which monocytes differentiate to generate
TAM is unclear. Here, we report that the mTOR pathway is a critical element in the regulation of monocyte
differentiation to TAM. In human peripheral monocytes stimulated by lipopolysaccharide, mTOR was inhibited
by rapamycin or activated by RNA interference–mediated knockdown of the mTOR repressor tuberous sclerosis
complex 2 (TSC2). Rapamycin caused the monocytes to differentiate into M1 macrophages releasing more
interleukin (IL)-12 and less IL-10, whereas TSC2 knockdown caused the monocytes to differentiate into M2
macrophages releasing less IL-12 and more IL-10. In parallel fashion, angiogenic properties were promoted or
reduced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells cocultured with TSC2-deﬁcient monocytes or rapamycintreated monocytes, respectively. Furthermore, tumor angiogenesis and growth in murine xenografts were
promoted or reduced by infusion of hosts with TSC2-deﬁcient or TSC2-overexpressing monocytes, respectively.
Finally, in vivo depletion of macrophages was sufﬁcient to block the antiangiogenic effects of rapamycin on
tumors. Our results deﬁne the TSC2–mTOR pathway as a key determinant in the differentiation of monocytes into
M2 phenotype TAM that promote angiogenesis. Cancer Res; 72(6); 1363–72. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Inﬂammation and cancer are connected, as cancers arise at
chronic inﬂammatory sites (1, 2), and inﬂammatory cells
participate in processes of tumor progression such as neoangiogenesis. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play a
prominent role in tumor invasion by promoting tumor angiogenesis in contrast to the antitumor effects of classical activated macrophages (3–6). Depleting macrophages in tumors
reduces tumor angiogenesis (7, 8), although the molecular
mechanisms governing macrophages and angiogenesis are
unknown.
The mTOR is a central regulator of cell growth that phosphorylates ribosomal p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) and initiation
factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) to control the synthesis
of translation components (9). The tuberous sclerosis complex

2 (TSC2) is an upstream negative regulator of mTOR (10, 11).
The TSC2–mTOR pathway may alter cytokine secretion to
regulate innate immune responses, such as the monocyte
macrophage system (12–14). However, the involvement of the
TSC2–mTOR pathway in macrophage-induced angiogenesis is
unclear.
The STAT3 controls an important inﬂammation-related
signaling pathway in cancer development, and it is activated
by tyrosine phosphorylation in both immune and tumor cells
(15). STAT3 inhibits macrophage-derived antitumor immune
responses (16) and is involved in macrophage differentiation
and development of the tumor microenvironment (17–20).
mTOR, which regulates STAT3 activation in cells including
immune cells, might promote tumor angiogenesis (12, 21).
Rapamycin downregulates microvessel density in vivo (22, 23).
Together, these ﬁndings suggest that TSC2–mTOR may promote angiogenesis via macrophages and that STAT3 may be a
downstream effector.
Here, we used both in vivo and in vitro assays to investigate
the role of the TSC2–mTOR pathway in regulating macrophages to induce tumor angiogenesis. Our ﬁndings suggest
that activating mTOR promoted macrophage-induced angiogenesis through STAT3, whereas inhibiting mTOR promoted
macrophage-mediated antitumor effect.

PBMCs by magnet-mediated cell separation (CD14 magnetic
beads; Miltenyi Biotec). The phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated
antibody against CD14 was used to analyze the purity of
PBMCs. The purity of human and mouse monocytes was about
95% (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). The isolated monocytes were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 100 U/mL penicillin, and
100 mg/mL streptomycin. Five mice were killed for every
reinfusion to have sufﬁcient mouse monocytes.
Kupffer cells were isolated from rat livers. The nonparenchymal cells were separated with an 18% Nycodenz gradient
(Nycomed Pharma A/S), and then Kupffer cells were further
separated with counterﬂow centrifugal elutriation in a J2-MC
centrifuge (Beckman-Coulter). The purity of the Kupffer cells
was determined with CD68 immunoﬂuorescence and latex
bead–mediated phagocytosis (Sigma-Aldrich).
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were
isolated from umbilical veins and cultured in M199 medium
(Invitrogen) containing 20% FBS, 15 mg/mL endothelial cell
growth supplement, 2 nmol/L L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.
The Huh-7 hepatocarcinoma cell line (Japanese Collection of
Research Bioresources, Sennan-shi, Osaka, Japan) was cultured
similar to HUVECs. We did not conduct test and authentication for this cell line after we purchased it from the company.
Cell transfection
Monocytes were transfected with scrambled siRNA (50 to 30 :
GATCATCCTTGATCTTATA) or siRNA for TSC2 or STAT3
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 48 hours before use. Mouse monocytes were similarly
transfected with the TSC2 plasmid (pEGFP-c2-TSC2) or the
TSC2 siRNA plasmid (pEGFP-c2-TSC2 siRNA) before being
reintroduced to the mice.
Determination of cytokine concentrations
A total of 1  106 TSC2 siRNA-transfected human
monocytes or 2  105 Kupffer cells were pretreated with
20 nmol/L rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 90 minutes while
plated in 24-well plates and then stimulated by 100 ng/mL
lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma-Aldrich). After 48 hours,
cell-free supernatants were collected. The concentrations
of interleukin (IL)-12-p40, IL-12-p70, IL-6, TNF-a, IL-10,
VEGF, IL-1, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1)
were measured by ELISA using kits (R&D Company).
Immunoblot analysis
A total of 1  107 human monocytes were stimulated as
indicated after 24 hours of starvation in serum-free medium.
Cellular lysates (40 mg) were analyzed by standard Western
blotting techniques. Immunoreactive bands were developed by
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; GE Healthcare) and visualized by autoradiography (Kodak). Relative levels of total and
phosphorylated proteins were determined with these antibodies: anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) and anti-STAT3 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology); anti-phospho-TSC2 (Ser939), anti-TSC2,
anti-phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), anti-mTOR, anti-phosphop70S6k (Thr389), anti-p70S6K, anti-phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/

Matrigel angiogenesis assay in vitro
A total of 2  104 primary HUVEC cells were plated on 24well plates coated with Matrigel (BD Bioscience), incubated for
1 hour at 37 C with 5% CO2, cocultured with monocytes for
12 hours, and subsequently the development of capillary
structures and tubular networks was analyzed by light microscopy (Leica Microsystems).
Subcutaneous xenograft of Huh-7 cells in nude mice
Male nude mice that were 5 weeks old weighing 18 to 20 g
(Shanghai Experimental Animal Institute, Shanghai, China)
were housed in a pathogen-free room. The experimental
animals were handled in compliance with the guidelines of
the Animal Ethics Committee of Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, PR China). After Huh-7 cells were harvested, 106 cells
were resuspended in 100 mL saline solution and inoculated into
one ﬂank of each mouse. After 3 weeks, the tumors were 100
mm3 and the mice were divided into 3 treatment groups.
In experiment A, 35 tumor-bearing mice were divided into 4
groups: control group (n ¼ 5), rapamycin group (5 mice
intraperitoneally administered with 1 mg/kg rapamycin daily),
GdCl3 group (5 mice injected with 10 mg/kg GdCl3 once a week
through the caudal vein), and combined group (20 mice
injected with both GdCl3 and rapamycin). After 2 weeks, 5
mice from each group were killed, and then the xenografts were
removed and saved for additional research. The remaining 15
mice from the combined group were injected with GdCl3 again,
and then divided into 3 groups: rapamycin group (5 mice
administered 1 mg/kg rapamycin daily), rapamycin plus monocyte group (5 mice administered 1 mg/kg rapamycin daily and
daily infusion of 5  106 mouse monocytes), and monocyte
groups (5 mice had only 5  106 mouse monocytes reintroduced the next day). Injected monocytes were not pretreated
with rapamycin or LPS. The different experimental monocytes
were directly injected intravenously into mice. After 1 week, the
mice were sacriﬁced by cervical dislocation, and the xenografts
were removed for analysis.
In experiment B, 20 male nude mice were treated with
subcutaneous xenografts of Huh-7 cells established as earlier
and divided into 4 groups: control group (5 mice injected with
vehicle daily), GdCl3 group (5 mice injected with 10 mg/kg
GdCl3 weekly), TSC2 siRNA group (5 mice treated with 5  106
monocytes transfected with the TSC2 siRNA), and TSC2 group
(5 mice treated with 5  106 monocytes transfected with the
TSC2).
In experiment C, 20 additional tumor-bearing nude mice
were divided into 4 groups: control group (5 mice injected with
vehicle daily), NSC 74859 group [5 mice treated with 5 mg/kg
NSC 74859 (Merck KGaA) intraperitoneally every other day],
GdCl3 group (5 mice injected with 10 mg/kg GdCl3 weekly), and
combined group (5 mice injected with both 10 mg/kg GdCl3
and 5 mg/kg NSC 74859 as described earlier). All the mice were
killed by cervical dislocation 2 weeks later. The xenografts were
removed and stored for further examination.

TSC2–mTOR Regulates Macrophage-Induced Tumor Angiogenesis

Histology and immunohistochemistry
Formalin-ﬁxed tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Both CD31 and CD68 were immunohistochemically examined on the parafﬁn sections using primary antibodies diluted 1:75 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The mean
vessel density was quantiﬁed in sections stained for CD31 by
capturing 10 random ﬁelds (0.159 mm2) at 100 magniﬁcation.

Rat tumor induction
A total of 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats with body weights of
160 to 180 g and aged from 6 to 7 weeks (Shanghai Experimental Animal Institute, Shanghai, China) had hepatomas
induced by continuously administering 0.01% diethylnitrosamine via drinking water for 12 weeks.
Two weeks after tumor inoculation, the 10 rats in the
rapamycin and 10 in the control group had 2 mg/kg rapamycin
(Hangzhou Huadong Medicine Group) or saline solution,
respectively administered intragastrically. All rats were sacriﬁced by cervical dislocation 4 weeks later, and the livers were
removed, photographed, and examined by immunohistochemistry for CD31 and CD68 expression.

Results
Manipulating the TSC2–mTOR pathway modulated
cytokine secretion and vessel formation
To investigate the impact of mTOR activity on macrophages,
cytokine secretion was assessed in human monocytes (Fig. 1).
Monocytes in rapamycin þ LPS group secreted more IL-12p40, IL-12-p70, IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1 and secreted signiﬁcantly
less IL-10, MCP-1, and VEGF than in the LPS group (All
P < 0.05; Fig. 1A) and the majority of cells in the population
shifted to expressing IL-12-p40 (Supplementary Fig. S1C). LPS
treatment signiﬁcantly increased the release of these cytokines
compared with non-LPS–treated control cells. Treatment with
LPS increased the phosphorylation of mTOR compared with
control on Ser2448 (a frequent site of mTOR phosphorylation;
ref. 24), 4E-BP1, and STAT3 of the downstream mTOR pathway
(Fig. 1B). Treatment with rapamycin reduced mTOR phosphorylation although the phosphorylation was higher than the
untreated control. CD206 (mannose receptor), a marker of M2
macrophages, was not detected in the rapamycin þ LPS
treatment group (Supplementary Fig. S1D) but it was highly
expressed on TSC2 siRNA–treated cell surfaces (Supplementary Fig. S1E). To assess whether rapamycin may affect the
phosphorylation of other LPS-stimulated pathways, we eval-

uated the phosphorylation NF-kB and p38/mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) after rapamycin treatment. Rapamycin
did not affect the phosphorylation of p38 but did increase the
phosphorylation of NF-kB (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B).
The effect of reduced TSC2 on cytokine secretion and
protein expression was examined by transfection of cells with
TSC2 siRNA. Compared with monocytes transfected with
unspeciﬁc siRNA, monocytes transfected with TSC2 siRNA
secreted signiﬁcantly less IL12-p40, IL12-p70, IL-6, TNF-a, and
IL-1 and secreted more IL-10, MCP-1, and VEGF (all
P < 0.05; Fig. 1C). Increased phosphorylation of mTOR,
p70S6K, 4E-BP1, and STAT3 was detected in monocytes transfected with TSC2 siRNA (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that
monocytes treated with rapamycin and subsequently stimulated by LPS developed the M1-like macrophage phenotype,
whereas monocytes transfected with TSC2 siRNA developed
the M2-like macrophage phenotype.
To deﬁne the potential role of mTOR in monocyte-induced
angiogenesis, vessel formation by human monocytes with
different treatments was assayed in vitro (Fig. 2). Rapamycin
treatment signiﬁcantly reduced LPS-induced vessel formation
(P ¼ 0.004; Fig. 2A and B). Conversely, TSC2 siRNA treatment
signiﬁcantly increased vessel formation (P ¼ 0.005; Fig. 2C and
D). However, addition of VEGF antibody did not signiﬁcantly
block TSC2 siRNA–induced angiogenesis (see Supplementary
Fig. S3A and S3B).

TSC2–mTOR Regulates Macrophage-Induced Tumor Angiogenesis

Macrophages mediate the antitumor effects of
rapamycin in vivo
Because rapamycin inhibits tumor angiogenesis in vivo,
nude mice were inoculated with Huh-7 hepatocarcinoma cells
to form subcutaneous tumors and subsequently treated with
GdCl3 to deplete monocytes or rapamycin to inhibit mTOR, or
both (Fig. 3, experiment A). The monocytes/macrophages in
GdCl3-treated tumor tissue were signiﬁcantly lower than in the
untreated group (0.17% vs. 9.4%; Supplementary Fig. S4). The
GdCl3-treated mice trended toward lower gross tumor volume
and relative lower ratio of tumor weight to body weight (15.4 vs.
39.6 mg/g, P ¼ 0.0022). Interestingly, the mice treated with both
GdCl3 and rapamycin had larger tumors than rapamycin alone
(Fig. 3A, P < 0.05). The rapamycin-treated mice had the smallest
tumors and a lower ratio of tumor weight to body weight
(4.6 mg/g) than control mice (P ¼ 0.0001, right).
The reintroduction of exogenous monocytes into GdCl3treated mice rescued tumor growth (Fig. 3B) and the addition
of exogenous monocytes plus rapamycin signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor growth (P < 0.0001). Further analysis of microvessel
density found that rapamycin signiﬁcantly inhibited exogenous monocyte-induced microvessel density formation
(Fig. 3C). These ﬁndings suggest that rapamycin induced
monocytes to differentiate into the antitumor M1 phenotypes.

STAT3 mediates the effects of rapamycin on cytokine
secretion of monocytes

TSC2–mTOR signal pathway controls angiogenesis
induced by macrophages in vivo
In human and mouse monocytes, downregulation of TSC2
by TSC2 siRNA transfection signiﬁcantly increased the ratio of
phosphorylated mTOR/total mTOR in a time-dependent pattern, whereas overexpression of TSC2 by TSC2 cDNA transfection signiﬁcantly decreased mTOR phosphorylation (Fig. 4A
and B).
To investigate the role of mTOR in the xenograft tumor
growth induced by macrophages in vivo, we manipulated TSC2
expression in monocytes that had been reintroduced into mice
(Fig. 4C, experiment B). Mice treated with monocytes overexpressing TSC2 had the smallest tumor size. Tumors from
mice treated with TSC2 siRNA monocytes were larger than
mice treated with GdCl3 (P ¼ 0.0003) or control mice (P < 0.05).
Microvessel density assay indicated that overexpression of
TSC2 signiﬁcantly inhibited exogenous monocyte-induced
blood vessel formation, whereas TSC2 siRNA–treated monocytes dramatically induced angiogenesis (Fig. 4D).

with GdCl3 or with GdCl3 and NSC 74859 had statistically
similar tumor sizes (Fig. 5D, experiment C). We further found
that treatment with NSC 74859 blocked TSC2 siRNA–induced
blood vessel formation, indicating that STAT3 is necessary for
mTOR-induced angiogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S5A and
S5B).
The cytokine secretion of Kupffer cells and
hepatocarcinogenesis induced by diethylnitrosamine
are affected by mTOR
The Kupffer cells were identiﬁed by CD68 immunoﬂuorescent staining (Fig. 6A). Treating the Kupffer cells with rapamycin in vitro increased the secretion of IL-12-p40 (P ¼ 0.011),
TNF-a (P ¼ 0.002), and IL-6 (P < 0.001) and decreased IL-10
compared with control (Fig. 6B, P ¼ 0.002). Furthermore, large
clumps of tumor were easily seen in the liver of the control rats
but not in rapamycin-treated animals (Fig. 6B). In addition, less
CD31 staining was detected in the liver of rapamycin-treated
rats; however, CD68 staining did not alter the number of
Kupffer cells (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
In this study, we found that inhibiting of mTOR by either
rapamycin or overexpression of TSC2 or blocking STAT3 in
monocytes/macrophages promoted the release cytokines of
the M1 and inhibited tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. These
effects were conﬁrmed with decreased tumor angiogenesis and
the requirement of monocytes. We also conﬁrmed that acti-

vating the mTOR signaling pathway by treating monocytes/
macrophages with TSC2 siRNA promoted release of cytokines
of the M2 phenotype and promoted tumor growth. These
ﬁndings were conﬁrmed by the increased tumor and the
requirement for monocytes.
TAMs are considered a polarized population of M2
macrophages, especially when the tumor begins to invade,
vascularize, and develop (3, 4). The classiﬁcation of polarized
macrophages as either the M1 or M2 phenotype is mainly
based on differential secretion of cytokines. The M1 phenotype
secretes IL-12 and TNF and later the M2 phenotype secretes IL10. This study found that TAMs profoundly inﬂuenced the
regulation of tumor angiogenesis and that depleting macrophages reduced vascular density and delayed tumor growth.
This study shows that inhibiting mTOR increased IL-12
production and decreased IL-10 production in monocytes, in
agreement with previous studies (12, 13). The opposing roles of
IL-12 and IL-10 provide a new explanation of the antitumor
effects of inhibiting mTOR activity. The fact that IL-12-p70 was
only modestly upregulated might suggest that excess IL-12-p40
may form homodimers, although we did not detect IL-12-p40
homodimers in these experiments.
Because the antitumor effects of rapamycin are mainly
attributed to inhibited angiogenesis (22, 23), it is exciting that
the rapamycin effects were eliminated by depleting macrophages with GdCl3, a known inhibitor of Kupffer cell activation
(26, 27). Reintroducing monocytes recovered the antitumor
effects of rapamycin. Rapamycin enhanced and TSC2 siRNA
attenuated the phagocytic capability of macrophages

(Supplementary Fig. S6), which was reversed by reintroduction
of macrophage inﬁltration into tumors (Supplementary Fig.
S7A–S7C). These ﬁndings strongly suggested that the antitumor effects of rapamycin were mediated by induction of
macrophages with the antitumor M1 phenotype.
Inhibiting mTOR altered the monocyte cytokines in vitro by
increasing IL-12 and decreasing IL-10. This ﬁnding suggested
that the mTOR signal may participate in polarizing macrophages, which would explain the essential role of monocytes in
the ability of rapamycin to inhibit angiogenesis. Phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 is mediated by the p70S6 kinase (24)
and our ﬁndings suggest that this may be controlled by
inhibiting the phosphorylation of p70S6. We found that rapamycin did not inhibit the phosphorylation of p38 but did
enhance the phosphorylation of NF-kB. Releasing of IL-12
required activated NF-kB in macrophages (28, 29). This indicated that the cytokine released by rapamycin-treated macrophages might be mediated through NF-kB pathway. In addi-

tion, although TSC2 siRNA resulted in an upregulation of
VEGF, adding of VEGF antibody did not signiﬁcantly block
TSC2 siRNA–induced angiogenesis.
Our ﬁndings indicated that mTOR regulates the ability of
macrophages to induce angiogenesis. Rapamycin downregulates secretion of IL-10, which promotes the production of
VEGF in both immune and tumor cells resulting in strengthening of the macrophage T-helper cell (TH1) response. Our
experiments suggest that that the TSC2–mTOR pathway–
regulated angiogenesis may be mediated by other growth
factors, not only through VEGF. We also found that rapamycin
enhanced TSC2 siRNA attenuation of macrophage phagocytosis (Supplementary Fig. S6). Although our rapamycin experiments support the idea that the mTOR pathway acts via
monocytes to promote tumor growth, it is possible that the
effect of rapamycin may affect monocytes through other
mechanism. In an in vitro experiment, we found that rapamycin mainly stimulated monocytes to release cytokines which

had antiangiogenic effects and reduced the release of proangiogenic cytokines (Supplementary Fig. S8A and S8B).
Because STAT proteins regulate cytokine-dependent
inﬂammation and immunity, they are central in determining
whether cancer is promoted or inhibited by immune responses
(30). The activation of STAT3 mediates such cancer-promoting
properties as neoangiogenesis in macrophages (31, 32) and
secretion of IL-10 and IL-12 in TAMs (18, 24). We also found
that inhibiting STAT3 mediated the upregulation of IL-12 and
the downregulation of IL-10 in macrophages, resulting in
neoangiogenesis and inhibited tumor growth. The important
role of macrophages in this process was shown by the reduced
antitumor effects of NSC 74859 when monocytes were depleted. Our results agreed with previous work showing that NSC
74859 inhibits tumor growth more in vivo than in vitro (33). Our
study agreed with the ﬁnding of previous studies that STAT3
was the downstream target of mTOR in macrophages and in
many other cell types (12, 21). We also found that treatment
with NSC 74859 blocked TSC2 siRNA–induced blood vessel

formation, indicating that STAT3 was necessary for mTORinduced angiogenesis. The secretion of cytokines regulated
by inhibiting mTOR also involves NK-kB, which regulates IL12-p40. Inhibiting mTOR led to activation of NK-kB, which
augmented the secretion of IL-12-p40, whereas inhibiting
STAT3 only impaired the secretion of IL-10 (12). However,
this study found that when mTOR was inhibited, STAT3
decreased the secretion of both IL-12-p40 and IL-10. Thus,
STAT3 mediates the effects of mTOR in macrophageinduced neoangiogenesis, potentially providing us new
insights into innate immune responses and new targets for
cancer therapy.
We also found that rapamycin affects Kupffer cells by
enhancing IL-12 and inhibiting IL-10 production, indicating
that the mTOR pathway is involved in the function of Kupffer
cells. Rapamycin reduced the angiogenesis and growth of
tumors that were induced by diethylnitrosamine in rats. Additional experiments are required to further investigate that how
rapamycin affects tumor formation in the liver.

In summary, we have identiﬁed a critical role of the TSC2–
mTOR pathway in regulating angiogenesis that is induced by
phagocytic cells. When mTOR was activated in monocytes
by knocking down TSC2 with siRNA, STAT3 was activated
and IL-10 increased while IL-12 decreased in a manner
similar to TAM secretion and resulted in neoangiogenesis
in vivo. Conversely, inhibiting mTOR had a reciprocal effect.
These ﬁndings suggest that inhibiting TSC2–mTOR–STAT3
in the innate immune response may be a novel and effective
therapeutic avenue.
