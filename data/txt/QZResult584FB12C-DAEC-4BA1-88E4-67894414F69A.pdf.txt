BACKGROUND: Metabolic activity assessed by 18F-fluorodeoxyglocuse-positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET)
reflects biological aggressiveness and prognoses in various tumors. The authors present a correlation between tumor
metabolic activity and clinical outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Over a 3-year
period (2005-2008), 135 locally advanced HCC patients were treated with localized concurrent chemoradiotherapy
(CCRT; external beam radiotherapy at 45 grays for 5 weeks plus concurrent hepatic arterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil
during the first and fifth week) followed by repetitive hepatic arterial infusional chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and
cisplatin. Among them, the authors studied 107 who received 18F-FDG-PET before CCRT. Maximal standardized
uptake values (SUVs) of tumors were calculated. RESULTS: The median maximal tumor SUV was 6.1 (range, 2.419.2). Patients with low maximal tumor SUVs (<6.1) had a higher disease control rate than those with high maximal
tumor SUVs (6.1) (86.8% vs 68.5%, respectively, P ¼ .023). Both median progression-free survival (PFS; 8.4 vs 5.2
months; P ¼ .003) and overall survival (OS; 17.9 vs 11.3 months; P ¼ .013) were significantly longer in the low maximal
tumor SUV group than in the high maximal tumor SUV group, respectively. In multivariate analysis, low maximal tumor SUV and objective responses to CCRT remained significant for PFS and OS. The high maximal tumor SUV group
was more likely to have extrahepatic metastasis within 6 months than the low maximal tumor SUV group (58.1% vs
26.8%, respectively; P < .001). Similar results were obtained for the maximal tumor SUV/normal liver maximal SUV ratio (<2 vs 2) concerning progression, death, and extrahepatic metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic activity may
be useful not only in predicting prognosis and treatment responses, but also in establishing optimal treatment plans

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which accounts for >5% of cancers globally, is ranked as the sixth most com-

mon cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.1 The incidence of HCC is rising in developed
countries and continues to be high in endemic areas such as Asia.1,2 Although surgical resection or local ablative therapies
such as radiofrequency ablation and percutaneous ethanol injection achieve the best outcomes, with a 5-year survival rate
of 60%-70% in patients treated during early stages, only about 30% are amenable to potentially curative treatments.3,4
For the majority of HCC patients, these treatment modalities with curative intent are no longer feasible, because of
advanced diseases, including extensive tumor burden with portal vein thrombosis and intratumoral/extratumoral spread,
or poor liver function at presentation.3,4

Original Article

To date, several therapeutic options, such as transhepatic arterial chemoembolization, external/internal irradiation, and molecular targeted agents, have been evaluated
for advanced HCC, and sorafenib is now recommended
as a category 1 drug in such cases owing to its proven survival benefits over the best supportive care.5-7 However, a
treatment of choice has yet to be established in locally
advanced HCC without extrahepatic metastasis. Among
various treatment modalities, 3-dimensional conformal
radiation therapy (3DCRT) has made it possible to escalate the irradiation dose for advanced HCC without
undue dose-limiting toxicity, and is now recognized as a
potentially curative option.8 Recently, the combination of
intra-arterial chemotherapy and localized 3DCRT has
been reported to improve treatment response rates, compared with the poor outcomes experienced with monotherapy for locally advanced solid tumors. This finding
supports a beneficial interaction between radiotherapy
and chemotherapy.8-11 So far, localized concurrent
chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) followed by repetitive
hepatic arterial infusional chemotherapy (HAIC) in
locally advanced HCC without extrahepatic metastasis
has been attempted at several institutions, with promising
results.9
Conversely, positron emission tomography (PET)
imaging using 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is
an imaging technique based on the increased rate of glucose uptake in several kinds of malignant tumors.12,13 So
far, 18F-FDG-PET has been proposed as a prognostic predictor as well as a noninvasive measurement of the biological aggressiveness of the tumor in the field of oncology.
Likewise, in HCC, several investigators have reported that
18
F-FDG uptake evaluated by preoperative PET scan is
associated with tumor differentiation as well as recurrences and survival after resection or transplantation.14-17
Hence, it is feasible that 18F-FDG uptake on PET scan,
like size and number criterion, might be an important
prognostic factor in the establishment of treatment and
surveillance plans. However, most studies on HCC and
18
F-FDG-PET have focused primarily on either tumor
detection in preoperative settings or prognostic value in
patients treated with resection or transplantations. There
are few data on the clinical significance of 18F-FDG-PET
in HCC patients who have undergone nonsurgical treatments.14,15,17-19 Furthermore, to date, there have been no
data on the appropriate application of the clinical significance of 18F-FDG-PET in patients who have undergone
localized CCRT followed by repetitive HAIC for locally
advanced HCCs.

Here, we investigated the value of metabolic activity
assessed by 18F-FDG-PET as a prognostic factor in
patients who were treated with localized CCRT followed
by HAIC for locally advanced HCCs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
In this study, we consecutively enrolled patients with locally
advanced HCC without extrahepatic metastasis who
received localized CCRT at Severance Hospital, Yonsei
University College of Medicine between January 2005 and
June 2008. Diagnosis of HCC was based upon pathologic
confirmation or typical appearance of HCC on 2 dynamic
imaging examinations (computed tomography [CT] and
magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), or via 1 dynamic
technique with elevated serum a-fetoprotein (AFP; >400
ng/mL).20 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans were obtained 10 to
14 days before the initiation of localized CCRT.
Eligible patients for localized CCRT met the following criteria: at least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion,
age 18 to 75 years, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status of 0 to 1, life expectancy of at
least 3 months, Child-Pugh class A or B, and adequate
function in other organs (serum creatinine <1.5mg/dL,
aminotransferase <5 the upper limit of normal, absolute neutrophil count 1500 cells/lL, platelet count
75,000/lL, and hemoglobin 10 g/dL). Patients with
diffuse or multifocal bilobar tumors were not considered
to be eligible for localized CCRT, because whole liver irradiation can cause serious hepatic toxicity. Other exclusion
criteria for localized CCRT included extrahepatic or
another concurrent malignancy, experience of recent
upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and any other underlying
serious medical condition interfering with participation
in the study. Among patients who underwent localized
CCRT according the above criteria, those who underwent
18
F-FDG-PET/CT before the initiation of treatment
were included in the study. The modified International
Union Against Cancer TNM staging system21 and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging systems22 were adopted.
The study protocol was in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. Written, informed consent was obtained from each participant
or a responsible family member.
Treatment Protocols
Under the standard localized CCRT protocol, patients
received a total radiation dose of 45 grays in 25 fractions

over a period of 5 weeks, with concurrent hepatic arterial
infusion of 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/d for 5 hours on
5 consecutive days through an implanted port system)
during the first and fifth weeks of radiotherapy.9 This
localized CCRT was followed by repetitive HAIC with
5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2 for 5 hours on 3 consecutive
days) and cisplatin (60 mg/m2 for 2 hours on a single
day), administered through a port system every 4 weeks
for 2 to 12 cycles, depending on the tumor responses.9
The standard localized CCRT and HAIC protocols were
strictly maintained during the study period.
PET Imaging
All patients fasted for at least 6 hours before an 18F-FDGPET/CT scan. Scanning was performed when the plasma
glucose level before administration of 18F-FDG was
<130 mg/dL. Scanning was initiated about 1 hour after
administration of 18F-FDG. The median time to scanning after injection was 60 minutes (range, 57-61
minutes). A low-dose noncontrast CT scan was obtained
for attenuation correction using the following parameters:
120 kVp, 50 mAs, 0.5 seconds rotation time, 5.0 mm
scan reconstruction, 60 cm field of view, and a 512  512
matrix for the Gemini. Images from the neck to the proximal thighs were obtained using the Phillips Gemini PET
scanner (Phillips-ADAC Medical Systems, Hanover,
Mass) with a spatial resolution of 5.3 mm in the center of
the field of view. Data were acquired in a 3-dimensional
(3D) mode after an intravenous administration of 370 to
444 MBq of 18F-FDG. After PET imaging, contrastenhanced CT images were acquired (intravenously bolus
60% wt/vol at 1.5-2.0 mL/s). The obtained PET images
were reconstructed using the 3D row-action maximum
likelihood iterative reconstruction algorithm (interation
number, 2; relaxation parameter, 0.006).
PET Interpretation
Two experienced nuclear medicine specialists, who were
unaware of the clinical information, were responsible for
reading the 18F-FDG-PET/CT images. In the cases of discrepancy in determining target tumor lesions, a consensus
was reached and was used for analysis. Positive malignant
FDG uptake was defined as an abnormal increase in comparison with the background activity in the surrounding
tissue. The standardized uptake value (SUV) was assessed
by region of interest (ROI) analysis with guidance from
the CT or MRI scans and calculated as the activity concentration detected in the lesion divided by the injected
activity, with correction for radioactive decay and body

weight (lCi/g). The maximal tumor SUV was the peak
SUV in 1 pixel with the highest counts within the ROI
and in the case of multiple tumors, the maximal tumor
SUV was defined as the highest value of the tumors.
For normal liver regions, 3 circular ROIs of about
100 mm3 each were drawn, 2 in the right lobe and 1 in
the left lobe, at a location where tumor was not detected
on other images and the maximal SUV of normal liver
was defined as the highest of the 3 ROIs drawn on normal
liver. Thereafter, another metabolic parameter suggested
by the previous investigator,15 maximal tumor SUV/normal liver maximal SUV ratio was calculated.
Response Evaluation
The response evaluation was carried out with a dynamic
CT scan or MRI, if appropriate, first at 1 month after
completion of localized CCRT and then after every 2
cycles of HAIC. We adopted the Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors, as follows: complete response
(CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD).23 Objective response was defined as
CR or PR, and disease control as CR, PR, or SD.
Response was analyzed by intention-to-treat analysis.
Statistical Analysis
The major goals of this study are to investigate clinical outcomes of localized CCRT and to evaluate the prognostic
value of metabolic activity assessed by 18F-FDG-PET.
Continuous and categorical variables were examined using
Student t test (or the Mann-Whitney U test if appropriate)
and the chi-square test, respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed from the date of the initiation of
localized CCRT until the date of first recurrence or death.
Overall survival (OS) was calculated as the time interval
between the date of the initiation of localized CCRT and
the date of death or last follow-up. Survival time was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the survival difference between groups was assessed by the log-rank test. The
Cox proportional hazards model was used for a multivariate analysis of survival. All variables found significant in the
univariate analysis were included in the multivariate model.
Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software version 9.1.3 (SAS, Cary, NC), and a 2-sided P value
<.05 was considered statistically significant.

79 (73.8%) patients were male. The median body mass
index was 22.6 kg/m2 (range, 17.2-29.8 kg/m2). The
most common etiology was hepatitis B virus infection (81
patients, 75.7%), and 101 were in Child-Pugh class A.
Eighty-two (76.6%) patients had stage IVA cancer, and
72 patients (71.0%) had portal vein thrombosis. The median maximal tumor SUV was 6.1 (range, 2.4-19.2).
Comparison of Clinical Characteristics
According to Maximal Tumor SUV
We divided the patients into 2 groups according to the
median value of the maximal tumor SUV; the low maximal
tumor SUV group (53 patients, maximal tumor SUV
<6.1) versus the high maximal tumor SUV group (54
patients, maximal tumor SUV 6.1). There were no significant differences in clinical variables between the 2 groups
except for the baseline AFP level, which was marginally
higher in the high maximal tumor SUV group (Table 2).
Radiologic Responses After Treatments
After localized CCRT, 0 and 31 patients had CR and PR
(objective response rate of 28.9%), whereas 52 and 24 had
SD and PD, respectively. After subsequent HAIC, 2 and
36 had CR and PR (objective response rate of 35.5%),
whereas 45 and 24 had SD and PD, respectively.
Table 3 also shows the detailed radiologic responses
to localized CCRT and to localized CCRT plus subsequent HAIC according to the maximal tumor SUV.

maximal tumor SUV group (5.2 months; 95% CI,
4.0-6.5 months; P ¼ .003) (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a
longer PFS was also observed in patients with the
lower baseline AFP level (8.4 months; 95% CI, 4.911.9 months; P ¼ .030) and those with objective
responses to localized CCRT (12.0 months; 95% CI,
7.1-16.9 months; P < .001), compared with those
with the higher baseline AFP level (5.1 months; 95%
CI, 3.9-6.4 months) and those without objective
response to localized CCRT (4.9 months; 95% CI,
4.0-5.8 months), respectively. In a multivariate analysis, the low maximal tumor SUV (adjusted hazard
ratio [HR], 0.481; 95% CI, 0.304-0.761; P ¼ .002)
also remained a significant independent predictor of a
lesser risk of progression, along with the objective
responses to localized CCRT (adjusted HR, 0.375;
95% CI, 0.223-0.631; P < .001) (Table 4).
The median OS was 12.6 months (95% CI, 11.313.9 months). Patients with a low maximal tumor SUV
(17.9 months; 95% CI, 11.0-24.7 months) had a significantly longer median OS than those with a high maximal
tumor SUV (11.3 months; 95% CI, 9.7-12.9 months;
P ¼ .013) (Fig. 2). In addition, a longer OS was observed
in patients without portal vein thrombosis (23.1 months
[95% CI, 7.2-39.0 months] vs 11.7 months [95% CI,
10.0-13.5 months]; P ¼ .021), and in those with an
objective response to localized CCRT (27.0 months [95%
CI, 12.0-43.0 months] vs 10.9 months [95% CI, 7.814.0 months]; P < .001). In a subsequent multivariate
analysis, the low maximal tumor SUV also remained a significant independent predictor of a lower risk of death
(adjusted HR, 0.545; 95% CI, 0.313-0.947; P ¼ .031),
along with objective responses to treatments (adjusted
HR, 0.317; 95% CI, 0.167-0.599; P < .001).

Maximal Tumor SUV and Extrahepatic
Metastasis
Patients with a high maximal tumor SUV had a significantly
higher incidence of extrahepatic metastasis (14 patients,
25.9%) after completion of localized CCRT than those with
a low maximal tumor SUV (4 patients, 7.5%; P ¼ .018),
with an odds ratio of 4.287 (95% CI, 1.308-14.052). In
addition, the high maximal tumor SUV group was more
likely to have extrahepatic metastasis within 6 months of the
initiation of treatment (58.1%) than the low maximal tumor
SUV group (26.8%, P < .001), with a HR of 2.544 (95%

was a significant correlation between the maximal tumor
SUV and maximal tumor SUV/normal liver maximal
SUV ratio by Pearson correlation test (r ¼ 0.799, P <

lesser risk of death (HR, 0.586; 95% CI, 0.354-0.970; P
¼ .038). In addition, those with maximal tumor SUV/
normal liver maximal SUV ratio 2.0 were more likely to
have extrahepatic metastasis within 6 months of the initiation of treatment (50.9%) than those with maximal tumor
SUV/normal liver maximal SUV ratio <2.0 (28.7%),
with an HR of 2.269 (95% CI, 1.382-3.726; P < .001).

DISCUSSION
Malignant tumors including HCC are known to have
increased glycolysis compared with normal tissues.24 The
increased activities of enzymes involved in glucose uptake
and intracellular glycolytic metabolism, such as glucose
transporter protein, hexokinase, and phosphofructokinase, result in the increased uptake of 18F-FDG in tumor
cells.24,25 However, because the expression of glucose-6phosphatase enabling 18F-FDG to accumulate in tumor
cells varies widely in HCC, only 50% to 70% of HCC
cases have positive 18F-FDG uptake, in contrast to metastatic liver cancer or cholangiocarcinoma.26,27 Thus, we
undertook the current study with the assumption that
such metabolic diversity in HCC may lead to differences
in biological characteristics, treatment outcomes, and ultimately prognosis. So far, most previous studies of HCC
and 18F-FDG-PET have primarily focused on either
detection of extrahepatic metastasis in preoperative settings or prognostic significance in patients who were
treated with surgical resection or transplantation.14,15 To
our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the prognostic value of quantitative metabolic activity and its corCancer

relation with clinical outcomes in subjects who have
undergone localized external beam radiotherapy along
with concurrent intra-arterial chemotherapy infusion performed in homogeneous protocols. Considering the relatively low sensitivity of 18F-FDG uptake in individual
HCCs, we selected the ROI of HCC with guidance from
dynamic CT or MRI for accurate measurement of the
maximal SUV.28 Because the combination of external
beam radiotherapy and intra-arterial chemotherapy infusion has been widely applied at many institutes, the results
from our study could help physicians accurately determine disease courses and establish further treatment plans.
In the present study, the localized CCRT showed
considerable antitumor effect, with a median PFS of 6.5
months and an OS of 12.6 months, suggesting a benefit
over the best supportive care and at least comparable outcomes with reference to sorafenib in patients with locally
advanced HCC, although this is not a direct comparative
study.5,7 As a prognostic factor, those with a low maximal
tumor SUV had a higher disease control rate, as well as
longer PFS and OS. On multivariate analysis, maximal tumor SUV independently affected both PFS and OS along
with the objective response to CCRT. In addition, a
higher baseline AFP level was significantly associated with
worse outcome in univariate analysis of PFS, but not in
multivariate analysis. This may be primarily because of
the higher baseline AFP levels observed in patients with
high maximal tumor SUVs, suggesting that patients with
high maximal tumor SUVs may have the more aggressive
tumor biology and disease burdens.27 Regarding OS, the
presence of portal vein thrombosis was a significant factor
in univariate analysis, but not in multivariate analysis.
However, we note that most of our patients had portal
vein thrombosis, and even those without it already had
highly advanced disease, in terms of number and size.
Another metabolic parameter, maximal tumor SUV/normal liver maximal SUV ratio, showed consistent prognostic implications with maximal tumor SUV in this study.
Therefore, the metabolic activity assessed by 18F-FDGPET might be useful in identifying subgroups with differential prognosis before treatment, considering that conventional staging systems such as TNM and Barcelona
Clinic Liver Cancer stage cannot discriminate the detailed
high-risk groups in patients with locally advanced HCC
without extrahepatic metastasis, because most of them fall
into the category of TNM IVA and Barcelona Clinic Liver
Cancer C stage.
Several factors may explain the prognostic implications of maximal tumor SUV. First, increased glucose

4785

metabolism and resulting relative glucose depletion in intracellular milieu in HCC cells might induce the expression of the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene, comprising
the treatment outcomes by activating an efflux pump to
chemotherapeutic agents.29 Second, the increased uptake
of 18F-FDG reflects the rapid growth of the HCC and
poor histologic differentiation associated with aggressive
biological behavior.17,19,26,30 In addition, the higher
expression of metalloproteinase-9 in tumor cells with
enhanced glucose metabolism might make invasion into
surrounding tissues and extrahepatic spread much easier.31 In the same context, HCC with a high uptake of
18
F-FDG exhibited microvascular invasion more frequently, which proved to be an important histopathological parameter, resulting in treatment failures like
intrahepatic/extrahepatic dissemination.32,33 Thus, it is of
note that patients with the higher baseline maximal tumor
SUV were more likely to have extrahepatic metastasis
within 6 months of treatment initiation (more than 2-fold
increase of risk) compared with those with low maximal
tumor SUV. In particular, patients with high maximal tumor SUV had an approximately 4-fold increase in the
incidence of extrahepatic metastasis after completion of
localized CCRT. For those high-risk patients, locoregional therapy, either localized radiotherapy or intra-arterial chemotherapy infusion, might be insufficient for
prevention of systemic dissemination of the disease. Thus,
the addition of other systemic therapy should be considered at an earlier stage of treatment for such patients. Theoretically, sublethal irradiation damage of HCC cells may
induce the compensatory activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathway mediators such as PI3K, MAPK,
JNK, NF-jB, and VEGF, not only leading to enhanced
intratumor angiogenesis, but also ultimately facilitating
earlier dissemination of HCC. Recent studies have shown
positive results upon maintenance of molecular target
agents such as sorafenib, along with chemoradiotherapy.34,35 Thus, such high-risk patients may benefit from
concomitant systemic therapy such as novel agents to
block multimolecular pathways.35-37
This study has several limitations. First, quantitative
assessments of changes in maximal tumor SUV from baseline after completion of chemoradiotherapy were not performed. Further studies investigating metabolic responses
as a prognostic factor are warranted. Second, histopathologic examinations on tumor specimens were not
included. Future studies covering the clinical correlation
between metabolic activity and the expression of various
regulatory enzymes and genes on tumor tissues are

4786

required to understand the tumor biology. Third,
although maximal tumor SUV had a good correlation
with the prognosis, considering that the repeatability of
the SUV measurement is not high in a single patient,
physicians should be cautious in interpreting this metabolic parameter. Therefore, further investigations to develop other metabolic parameters for generating the
reproducible results are warranted.
In conclusion, we have shown that tumor metabolic
activity before therapy, assessed by 18F-FDG-PET/CT, is
an independent prognostic factor in determining survival
outcomes in patients with locally advanced HCC who
have undergone localized CCRT followed by HAIC.
Thus, it could be used as an ancillary method for risk stratification in the treatment of HCC. Further studies are
required to investigate whether tumor metabolic activity
is similarly significant in other nonsurgical treatment
modalities, especially newer targeted agents.
