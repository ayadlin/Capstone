ABSTRACT
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has a propensity to spread to the cervical
lymph nodes (LN). The presence of cervical LN metastases severely impacts patient
survival, whereby the two-year survival for oral cancer patients with involved LN
is ~30% compared to over 80% in patients with non-involved LN. Elucidation of key
molecular mechanisms underlying OSCC metastasis may afford an opportunity to
target specific genes, to prevent the spread of OSCC and to improve patient survival. In
this study, we demonstrated that expression of the heterotrimeric G-protein alpha-12
(G`12) is highly up-regulated in primary tumors and LN of OSCC patients, as assessed
by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
We also found that exogenous expression of the constitutively activated-form of G`12
promoted cell migration and invasion in OSCC cell lines. Correspondingly, inhibition
of G`12 expression by shRNA consistently inhibited OSCC cell migration and invasion
in vitro. Further, the inhibition of G12 signaling by regulator of G-protein signaling
(RGS) inhibited G`12-mediated RhoA activation, which in turn resulted in reduced
LN metastases in a tongue-orthotopic xenograft mouse model of oral cancer. This
study provides a rationale for future development and evaluation of drug candidates
targeting G`12-related pathways for metastasis prevention.

metastasis [5]. Therefore, the elucidation of key molecular
mechanisms involving OSCC spread from their primary
site affords an excellent opportunity to target these genes
to prevent and stop the spread of OSCC and to improve
patient survival.
Gα12 and Gα13 are members of the G12
subfamily of heterotrimeric G-proteins [6]. Activation
of the G12 subfamily regulates a wide variety of
important cellular events and responses that range from
embryonic development [7–9], platelet activation [10,
11], angiogenesis [12], to apoptosis [13]. Most notably,

INTRODUCTION
Cancer metastasis is a major hurdle for cancer
treatment as it adversely impacts the quality of life and
patient survival [1]. Oral squamous cell carcinoma
(OSCC) predominantly spreads via the lymphatic
route, and primarily to the cervical lymph nodes (LN).
The presence of cervical LN metastases remains the
most significant prognostic indicator in OSCC patients
[2–4]. The two-year survival for OSCC patients with LN
metastasis is ~30% compared to 80% for those without LN

however, of the two α-subunits, (Gα12 and Gα13), it is
Gα12 that has consistently been demonstrated to play a
key role in cancer development and progression, largely
due to its potency in oncogenic transformation [14, 15].
There is now compelling evidence that Gα12
promotes cancer metastasis [16–19]. We have previously
reported that Gα12 was significantly up-regulated in
OSCC biopsies when compared to normal oral mucosa
regardless of risk habits of the patients [20]. In this study,
we sought to further investigate the functional impact
of Gα12 up-regulation on OSCC development and
progression. From our emerging data, we demonstrated
that inhibiting G12 signaling results in reduced OSCC
metastasis to LN, thereby identifying a potential
therapeutic target to prevent the spread of OSCC and a
range of other malignancies.

and the matched LNs in majority of the cases (7/12),
indicating that the high levels of Gα12 is retained in
both primary tumors and LN metastasis, and 3/12 (25%)
cases had increased Gα12 levels in the LN compared to
the primary tumor (Figure 1E). However 1/12 showed
consistently low expression of Gα12 in both the primary
tumor and LN, while the remaining one case, showed
high Gα12 levels in the primary but low in the matched
LN. For potential detailed functional analysis of these
observations, we next assessed the protein levels of Gα12
in a panel of OSCC cell lines previously established in
our laboratory. From our data, we found that Gα12 was
consistently overexpressed in the OSCC cell lines but not
in normal oral keratinocytes primary cultures (ORL218
and ORL232; Figure 1F). In particular, 4 OSCC cell
lines (ORL48, ORL174, ORL188 and ORL214) had the
highest Gα12 expression with reference to the HeLa cells
transduced to overexpress Gα12.

RESULTS

Activation and expression of Gα12 promotes
OSCC cell migration and invasion

Gα12 is up-regulated in OSCC
Previously, we reported that Gα12 mRNA levels
were up-regulated by more than two-fold in OSCC
[20]. In this study, we sought to further validate these
observations in an independent set of specimens and
to assess if high levels of Gα12 were likely to have a
biological impact on tumor progression. Firstly, as
Gα12 share 67% sequence similarity with Gα13 [6],
we examined mRNA levels of both molecules from
the same tissue sample set. We confirmed that Gα12
mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated in OSCC
(p=0.014), compared to Gα13 levels, which were
essentially unchanged between OSCC and NOM tissues
(Figure 1A). Furthermore, we found that the majority
of OSCC tissues (26/47; 55.3%) had mRNA levels of
Gα12 that were elevated ≥2 fold, further indicating the
overexpression of Gα12 in this cancer type (Figure 1B).
Consistently, IHC analysis demonstrated that the protein
levels of Gα12 were overexpressed in OSCC tissues and
tumor cells that have spread to the LN, but not in the
NOM tissues (Figure 1C). In particular, Gα12 protein
was significantly overexpressed in 34 of 43 (79.1%)
OSCC cases and majority of these have the intensity
score of 2 or 3 thus confirming our prior observations
(Figure 1D). In contrast, 22 of 23 (95.7%) of NOM
tissues showed low levels of Gα12 (intensity score 0–1).
Although Gα12 was differentially expressed between
OSCC and NOM, Gα12 was not associated with any
of the clinical parameters, as detailed in Table 1. We
next examined Gα12 protein levels in 12 LN positive
tissues that were matched to the primary tumors from
the same patient, and found that 10 of 12 patient samples
(83.3%) had Gα12 overexpression in tumor cells that had
metastasized to the cervical LN. Overall, Gα12 staining
intensity was essentially similar between primary tumors

From our previous data, we chose ORL150
cells, largely due to the lower Gα12 levels amongst the
OSCC cell lines examined, to ectopically overexpress
the constitutively active form of Gα12 (Gα12QL) using
pLXRN retrovirus transduction. Exogenous expression
of Gα12QL in ORL150 stimulated Gα12 signaling,
as indicated by the activation of down-stream RhoA
(supplementary Figure 1). We next determined if this
Gα12 activation was going to have an effect on cell
migration. As seen in the scratch assay, we observed that
the open wound area was 56.3% in ORL150/Gα12QL
cells when compared to 85.7% in the vector control (VC)
cells after 18 hours, indicating that expression of Gα12QL
significantly increased the rate of migration of ORL150
cells in closing the open wound area (p<0.001; Figure 2A).
Further, the transwell invasion assay demonstrated that
ORL150/Gα12QL cells had a significant increase in the
number of cells invading through the matrigel barrier in
response to NIH3T3 cell-conditioned medium, compared
to the VC cells (Figure 2B).
Previous work has reported that both Gα12 and
Gα13 of the G12 sub-family promote Rho activation by
binding to the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS)
domain of RGS-containing Rho guanine nucleotide
exchange factors (GEFs) [19, 21]. Here, we sought
to inhibit both Gα12 and Gα13 signaling in OSCC by
expressing a chimeric molecule consisting of GFP fused
to the RGS domain of PDZ-RhoGEF in ORL48 cells
(ORL48/RGS) (Supplementary Figure 2). ORL48 cells
were used for these studies due to high endogenous levels
of Gα12 protein as well as the ability to form tumors
when xenografted in mice. Expression of the chimeric
molecule did not alter the endogenous levels of total

indicated that Gα12 was significantly overexpressed at the mRNA level in OSCC tissues. As indicated by the box and whiskers plot, OSCC
tissues had a median of 2.35-fold increase in Gα12 expression, with a maximum level of 23-fold overexpression compared to normal oral
mucosa (NOM). Meanwhile, the median of Gα13 expression is 1.1-fold, suggesting no differential expression between OSCC and NOM.
(B) Gα12 mRNA levels were found to be overexpressed in 55.3% of OSCC tissues examined, and majority of the OSCC tissues had downregulation of Gα13, when using a cut-off fold-change value of ≥ 2. (C) IHC images showing NOM tissues have negative staining for Gα12

Pattern of invasion

Gα12 and Gα13 in ORL48 cells (Figure 3A), but was
demonstrated to behave as a dominant negative mutant
for G12 signaling by inhibiting LPA and thrombin
dependent RhoA activation (Figure 3B). We observed
that the endogenous level of activated RhoA was slightly
higher in the ORL48/RGS control (0 time point). The
levels of activated RhoA in ORL48/GFP control were
markedly induced upon LPA and thrombin stimulations,
respectively as early as 30 seconds. Interestingly, the
levels of activated RhoA in ORL48/RGS remained low
for up to 10 minutes of LPA and thrombin stimulations,
indicating that the expression of the GFP-fused RGS
chimeric molecule inhibited LPA- and thrombin-mediated
G12-RhoA signaling axis.
As the presence of RGS inhibited the G12-mediated
RhoA activation biochemically, we next examined if
the presence of RGS in ORL48 was likely to confer a
functional outcome. Here, we showed that the inhibition of
G12 signaling by the GFP-fused RGS chimeric molecule
caused a significant reduction of migration capacity as
indicated by the open wound area in ORL48/RGS, which
was 85.6% compared to 45.6% in the ORL48/GFP cells
(p<0.001, Figure 3C). To confirm that this reduction in
migration was due to reduced Gα12 functional activity
through RGS, we decided to use a knockdown approach
of reducing endogenously high levels of this protein
in ORL48 cells. As seen in Figure 3D, the two shRNA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

0.410+

sequences for Gα12 were able to reduce Gα12 protein
levels to 44% (shGα12 322311) and 22% (shGα12
322313), and when these cell populations with controls
were tested for their potential in cell migration and
invasion, we noted that there was a significant reduction
in cell motility and invasiveness in ORL48/shGα12
cells, compared to mocked transfected cells (Figure 3E).
Knockdown of Gα12 in ORL48 led to ~30% and ~70%
reduction in cell migration and invasion in response to
the NIH3T3 cells conditioned medium and thrombin,
respectively. Altogether, these findings strongly suggest
that both activation as well as overexpression of Gα12 can
lead to OSCC cell migration and invasion.

Inhibition of Gα12 signaling reduced OSCC
metastasis to LN in the orthotopic xenograft
model
OSCC frequently metastasize to the lymphatic
basin in the neck area. Given that the oral tongue is
composed of a dense lymphatic network, we developed
an orthotopic model of OSCC metastasis by injecting
ORL48 cells into the posterior of the tongue of NOD/
SCID mice. Following the same model as previously
reported [22], ORL48 cells formed moderately
differentiated tumors within 20 days and were noted
to be highly aggressive, invading the muscle and

hours. (B) Similarly, ORL150/Gα12QL cells demonstrated 4-fold increase in invasion in comparison to the ORL150/VC cells. NIH3T3

surrounding tissues (Supplementary  Figure  3A). More
importantly, ORL48 cells also metastasized into the
cervical LNs (Supplementary 3B). With this information
of the physiopathological behavior of ORL48 cells in
vivo, and that the overexpression of RGS inhibits G12
signaling in ORL48 cells in vitro, we next assessed the
impact of ORL48/RGS cells on OSCC spread to LN in
the orthotopic-tongue mouse model. Both ORL48/GFP
and ORL48/RGS cells formed ulcerating and highly
aggressive tumors on the tongue of NOD/SCID mice
after 20 days. Histopathological evaluation of the primary
tumors indicated that the tumor had invaded into the
muscle and the surrounding tissues (Figure 4A, i and
iii). Perhaps of importance, no difference in the primary
tumor volume was observed between the two groups
(Figure 4B). Furthermore, we observed that 12 out of the
14 (85.7%) animals injected with ORL48/GFP control
cells had OSCC spread to their cervical LN, while only
7 out of 15 (46.7%) animals injected with ORL48/RGS
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells showed metastatic spread (Figure 4A, ii and iv). This
difference in prevalence of LN metastasis (Figure 4C;
p=0.027), suggests that inhibition of G12-RhoA signaling
axis is not involved in regulating tumor growth but is
pivotal for the inhibition of OSCC metastatic progression.
In addition, we noticed that mice orthotopically injected
with ORL48/GFP cells had higher mortality rate, as 5
out of 19 mice died before day 20 whilst no deaths were
noted in the corresponding ORL48/RGS cohort during this
experimental period (data not shown). Taken together, our
results indicated that targeting the G12 signaling pathway
may be an effective approach to prevent metastasis burden
in OSCC patients.

Gα12 is not involved in OSCC cell proliferation

growth, we compared ORL150 cells expressing Gα12QL
with VC cells. Activation of Gα12 had no effect on OSCC

cell growth (Figure 5). This observation was confirmed
in ORL48/RGS and ORL48/shGα12 cells, where no
significant differences in the proliferation rate were found
when compared to their respective control cells. These
findings were consistent with our observation in the
animal studies, whereby inhibition of Gα12 signaling has
no effect on tumor volume (Figure 4B), suggesting that
Gα12 is not involved in driving OSCC cell proliferation.

harbors transforming capability [14, 15]. Studies on other
Gα subunit family members showed that constitutively
active mutants of Gαq and Gα11 are considered as driver
oncogenes in 66% of ocular melanomas [25]. However,
unlike the activating mutations found in other Gα subunit
family, whereby these hotspot mutations reduced the
rate of GTP hydrolysis of the active GTP-bound Gα
subunit, resulting in constitutive signaling activity, human
tumors carrying mutations that activate Gα12 have yet
to be reported to date [25–27]. In fact, in head and neck
cancers, Gα12 mutation frequency has been largely found
to be low (1.3%). It is possible that mutations in GPCRs
coupled to G12 family that are frequently found in other
cancers provide an oncogenic advantage, hence additional
gain-of-function mutations in these G-proteins may not
be frequently observed [25]. Following our observation
that high levels of Gα12 are predominantly detected in
OSCC and not in NOM tissues, it is possible that Gα12
may acquire an oncogenic transforming ability in the
overexpressed form, compared to other heterotrimeric
Gα proteins which have to attain the constitutively GTPbound form to induce transformation.
It is noteworthy that Gα12 and its G12 subfamily
counterpart, Gα13, share 67% amino acid identity [6],
and both appear to interact with the same receptors and
downstream effectors in mediating cell signaling [28,
29]. In this study we determined that while Gα13 levels
remained unchanged, Gα12 levels were observed to
be largely overexpressed in our OSCC tissue cohort,
indicating the importance of Gα12 in OSCC tumorgenesis
and progression. In this context, studies have suggested
that the functions of Gα12 and Gα13 may not completely
overlap, whereby Gα12 has been demonstrated to be more
potent in inducing oncogenic transformation including
cell shape changes and migration [15, 30], while Gα13
was noted to be more active in inducing angiogenesis and
apoptosis [12, 31].

DISCUSSION
When the spread of OSCC involves LN metastasis,
the prognosis of the patient is significantly reduced and
treatment becomes limited and invariably aggressive.
Unfortunately, approximately half of OSCC patients
present with metastatic cervical nodes at the time of
diagnosis or follow-up [23], hence understanding the
molecular mechanisms underlying OSCC progression
from a localized growth to LN metastasis is critical to
effectively prevent disease recurrence and ultimately
improve survival. In this study, we further validated
our previous observations that Gα12 is overexpressed
in an independent OSCC sample cohort, suggesting
an oncogenic role for Gα12 that warranted further
investigation. Data from our current findings are in-line
with studies reported in other solid cancers including
nasopharyngeal cancer [18], adenocarcinomas of the
breast and prostate [16, 17], as well as cell lines derived
from different tumor origins [24]. The basis of the
elevated Gα12 levels observed in our samples is unclear,
but emerging data from our group have noted that all our
OSCC cell lines with the exception of ORL214 showed
chromosomal amplification at the region where Gα12
resides (7p22.2) (unpublished copy number alterations
data). More importantly, studies have shown that Gα12
in the overexpressed and constitutively activated form

Several studies have demonstrated that
overexpression of Gα12 is associated with tumor
invasiveness [16–18, 32]. In this regard, our IHC analysis
of Gα12 on OSCC samples showed no association
between Gα12 expression in the primary tumors and LN
metastasis, but intriguingly high levels of this protein
were found to be retained in the OSCC cells that had
metastasized into the LN. More recently, during the
preparation of this manuscript, Jian and colleagues [32]
also found no association between Gα12 overexpression
and LN status in OSCC patients, but showed that Gα12
overexpression significantly correlated with extracapsular
spread.
We further examined the function of Gα12 in OSCC.
Although both activation by the use of Gα12 GTPase
defective mutants and overexpression of Gα12 have been
demonstrated to have transformation properties [14–16],
we focused here on the use of an activated Gα12 mutant
as it may facilitate the analysis of its consequences and
to minimize the variability that may be caused by relying
on overexpression and likely activation by endogenously
expressed Gα12-coupled receptors. Our in vitro data
demonstrated that expression of constitutively activatedGα12 increased OSCC cell migration and invasion. We
also demonstrated that inhibition of Gα12 expression in
OSCC cells by shRNA markedly inhibited OSCC cell
migration and invasion. Perhaps it is not too surprising
to find that deregulation of G12 promotes cell migration
and invasion in cancer development, since physiologically,
normal G12 proteins regulate cell polarity, cytoskeletal
rearrangement and processes governing cell shape changes
which are essential in controlling cell motility during
embryonic development [8, 9]. In addition, they also
regulate the migration of lymphocytes, neutrophils and
vascular smooth muscle cells [33–36].
Signaling by G12 proteins are responsible for the
Rho-dependent cytoskeletal changes required for cell
migration [28, 34, 37, 38]. Activation of G12 signaling
by PAR-1 and LPAR inducing cancer cell invasion have
been shown to be mediated by Rho proteins in breast and
prostate cancers [16, 17, 39]. Here, we investigated the
G12-RhoA signaling axis in OSCC, whereby expression
of RGS blocked G12 downstream signaling as indicated
by the reduction in LPA- and thrombin-dependent RhoA
activation. Blockade of G12 signaling by RGS resulted in
the inhibition of OSCC cell migration in vitro. In support,
RGS expression has been reported to block G12 signaling
in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, reduced SDF-1dependent Rho activation, causing a reduction in invasion
and migration [19]. Although we did not further examine
the downstream G12 signaling mechanism in mediating
cytoskeletal changes, it is possible that RhoA promotes
changes in the cytoskeletal architecture through ROCK,
and the remodeling of focal adhesion components through

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

protein kinase C-related kinase to collectively cause cellcell junction disruption [38]. Interestingly, G12 subfamily
can couple to the CXCR4 chemokine receptor and drive
tumor spread to specific organs in RhoA dependent manner
[19]. Also, G12 can enhance cell motility and invasion
independently of Rho proteins, such as by reducing cellextracellular matrix adhesion through integrins [40],
decreasing the rigidity of cell-cell contacts by reducing
the stability of homophilic E-cadherin interactions
[41], as well as by activating transcription factors that
control the expression of metalloproteases such as
matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 [29].
In a recent study, Gα12 signaling was shown to mediate
OSCC invasion by up-regulating proinflammatory
cytokines [32], suggesting that Gα12 is a critical player
in the inflammatory cytokines pathways during OSCC
tumorigenesis. In support of these observation, we have
recently reported that these proinflammatory cytokines
(IL-6 and IL-8) were found to be elevated in the serum
samples of OSCC patients using a novel antibody based
screening device [42], suggesting that high Gα12 level
may be causal for the induction of these cytokines.
More importantly, we further demonstrated that
RGS mediated inhibition of G12 signaling significantly
reduced the metastatic dissemination of OSCC cells from
the primary tumor mass to the LNs irrespective of size,
suggesting that G12 signaling does not impact the growth
of the primary tumor but is likely to drive metastasis. In
support of these observations, previous studies on breast
cancer also showed that the blockade of G12 downstream
signaling resulted in a notable impact on the metastatic
spread that resulted in a significant increase in metastasisfree survival of mice [16]. As mentioned earlier, OSCC
has a high potential to spread to the cervical LNs, therefore
any strategies that may result in locoregional control of the
disease will play an important role in improving patient
survival. Thus, these findings suggest that interfering with
the G12-Rho signaling axis and their key down-stream
targets may provide previously unexplored options to halt
OSCC metastasis.
Several studies have indicated that Gα12 may be an
important promoter for cell growth in certain cell types,
as this molecule in its wild-type and activated-form
has been shown to be involved in the proliferation of
fibroblasts [14, 15, 30, 43, 44]. In this study, both Gα12
expression and activation consistently showed no effect
in OSCC cell proliferation in in vitro results, suggesting
that Gα12 is not crucial in regulating OSCC cell growth
and proliferation. In support of our in vitro findings,
our in vivo data also suggested that the growth of
primary tumors on the tongue were not affected, despite
the reduction in LN metastasis when G12 signaling
was inhibited by RGS. Our findings are in agreement
with those reported by Kelly and colleagues [16, 17].

These differences seen in the role of G12 in controlling
cell proliferation may be due to the intrinsic properties
of the tumor and also the different cellular origin such
as the mesenchymal (fibroblasts) versus epithelial cells,
as Gα12 may exert specific effects through the different
down-stream signaling pathways [37].
In conclusion, the overexpression of Gα12 in OSCC
may be required for the amplification of G12 signaling to
promote the transforming effects of this oncogene. Further,
our data collectively support the functional significance
of Gα12 in OSCC tumor metastasis that has also been
reported in other human cancers [16, 17]. The presence
of LN metastasis in OSCC represents the most important
factor predicting a poor prognosis [45], and unfortunately
there are still limited therapeutic options to prevent disease
progression and OSCC spread. Many studies including
ours have indicated that perturbing the G12 signaling may
provide a reasonable approach to preventing metastasis in
patients at risk.

ethical review board at the Faculty of Dentistry, University
of Malaya (Ethical approval code: DFOP0703/0017).
Frozen tissues comprising of 47 OSCC and 18 normal
oral mucosa (NOM) tissues were used in this study. NOM
specimens were obtained from the gingiva of individuals
who did not have OSCC but had undergone wisdom tooth
removal. In addition, the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue specimens used in this study include 42 OSCC
specimens, 10 fibro-epithelial polyps (FEP), 13 NOM and
12 metastatic cervical LN specimens that are matched to
primary tumors. The diagnoses of all tissue specimens used
in this study were histopathologically confirmed by an oral
pathologist (RBZ). The socio-demographic information of
the patient cohort was obtained from the Malaysian Oral
Cancer Database and Tissue Bank System (MOCDTBS)
[46], and this is summarized in Table 2.

RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissues
containing at least 70% tumor cells (OSCC specimens) or
normal epithelial cells (for NOM) using the RNeasy Micro
kit (Qiagen, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The quality and quantity of RNA extracted
from these samples were evaluated using the Agilent
2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). cDNA
was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using the High

Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied
Biosystems, CA, USA) in a total volume of 100 μl, as
described previously [20].

Amplification kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). All
OSCC cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s Medium/Nutrient mixture F-12 HAM’s medium
(DMEM/F-12; Hyclone, Utah, USA) supplemented with
500 ng/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA),
and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Auckland, NZ).
Normal oral keratinocytes primary cultures (ORL218
and ORL232) established in our laboratory from healthy
gingival biopsies, were maintained in Keratinocyte
Serum-Free Medium (KSFM; Gibco, Auckland, NZ)
supplemented with 25 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract,
0.4 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 0.09 mM CaCl2.
Mouse NIH3T3 and packaging cell lines HEK-293T,
GP-293 (Clontech, CA, USA), were grown and maintained
in DMEM high glucose medium (Gibco, Auckland, NZ)
containing 10% FBS.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
qPCR was performed with standard SYBR Green
protocol using the ABI PRISM® 7000 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems, Germany), as described
previously [20]. Briefly, reactions were carried out by
performing a pre-incubation for 10 minutes at 95ºC,
followed by 40 amplification cycles at 95ºC for 15 seconds
and 60ºC for 1 minute. The primers used were as follow:

Relative quantification was performed by
comparative Ct method to normalize the expression of
Gα12 and Gα13 to the housekeeping gene GAPDH.
Relative expression of target genes in OSCC were
determined against Ct values of the NOM tissues.

Overexpression of activated Gα12 in OSCC
The Gα12QL plasmid was a kind gift from
Dr. Patrick Casey (Duke University Medical Centre).
GP-293 packaging cells were grown in a 60 mm dish
until 70% confluence (~24 hours) prior to transfection.
Retroviral stock was prepared by co-transfecting 5 μg of
pLXRN (vector control [VC]) or Gα12QL with 5 μg of
pVSVG (envelope) into the GP-293 packaging cells using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, CA, USA), according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The supernatants
containing the retrovirus were harvested after 48 hours
and filtered through 0.45 μm PVDF syringe filter. ORL150
cells expressing low levels of Gα12 were seeded at 1x105
cells in a 60 mm dish 18 hours prior to retroviral infection.
Then, filtered viral supernatant was added onto the
ORL150 cells with 10 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich,
MO, USA). Successfully transduced cells were selected
with 75 μg/ml G418 (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
The expression of Gα12 was examined by IHC
using the Dakocytomation Envision+ Dual Link SystemHRP (DAB+) kit (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). IHC was
performed on the FFPE primary OSCC tissues and 12
available matching lymph node tissues as described
previously [47]. The Gα12 polyclonal antibody (SC-409;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) was used as the
primary antibody at a dilution of 1:75. Immunoreactivity
of epithelial cells (cancer and normal) was scored based
on a 4-point intensity scoring system: 0 = negative
expression; 1 = weak positive; 2 = moderate positive;
3 = strong positive as described previously [16, 17]. All
IHC analysis was evaluated independently by a pathologist
(RBZ). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
was used to identify the best cut-off points in scoring the
expression of Gα12 for specificity and sensitivity, whereby
scores of 1 or 2 would be grouped as low expression,
while 3 or 4 would be considered as high expression.

Inhibition of G12 signaling by RGS
The green fluorescence protein (GFP)-fused to
the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) domain of
PDZ-RhoGEF has been previously described by Basile
and colleagues [48]. HEK-293T packaging cells were
grown in a 6-well plate until 70% confluence (~24 hours)
prior to transfection. Lentiviral stock was prepared by
co-transfecting RGS expression vector with pSPAX2
(packaging) and pVSVG (envelope) vectors in the ratio
of 3:1:1 into HEK-293T with Turbofect (Fermentas,
MD, USA) and thereafter, the cells were culture for
an additional 48 hours. The supernatants containing
lentiviruses were harvested and filtered through 0.45μm
PVDF syringe filter. ORL48 cells expressing high levels
of Gα12 were seeded at 2x105 cell density in 6-well plates
18 hours prior to lentiviral infection. ORL48 cells were
incubated with filtered lentiviral supernatant for 48 hours

Cell culture
Asian OSCC cell lines (ORL48, ORL115, ORL150,
ORL153, ORL174, ORL188, ORL207, ORL214) used in
this study were previously established in our laboratory
as described [47]. Prior to use, all lines underwent
authentication using the AmpF/STR® Identifier® PCR

RhoA pull-down assay

with 10 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA).
Virus titre efficiency was evaluated under a fluorescence
microscope (Olympus, Japan) to determine the percentage
of cells that express GFP. These cells were further sorted
by FACS (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) to harvest
only GFP-positive cells and these were further expanded
in normal growth medium for down-stream experiments.

RhoA activity in cultured cells was assessed as
described by Chikumi and colleagues [49]. Briefly, cells
were grown to 70% confluence in 100 mm dishes, serumstarved for 18 hours and then stimulated with 1U/ml
thrombin (Sigma, MO, USA) or 5 uM lysophosphatidic
acid (LPA) (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) for 30 seconds
to 10 minutes. Cells were lysed on ice with 600 μl of
cold lysis buffer (detailed above). Lysates were then
collected and centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 5 minutes at
4 ºC. From the resulting supernatants, 100 μl was used for
total RhoA protein levels, while the remaining 500 μl for
each sample were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose
4B beads (GE Healthcare, Sweden) bound to glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-rhotekin-RhoA binding domain for
30 minutes at 4ºC on a rotator. The beads were collected
by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 1 minute at 4ºC and
washed (x3) with cold lysis buffer. The associated GTPbound RhoA was released with protein loading buffer
and denatured by heating for SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis followed by western blotting. Blots
were incubated using anti-RhoA (sc-418; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, CA, USA) at 1:1000 dilution for 1 hour
and further processed according to western blotting
conditions mentioned above.

Gα12 knockdown by RNA interference
The pGIPz vectors containing Gα12 shRNA target
sequences:
shGα12 (388311): 5¢GGCAAGTCCACGTTCCTCA
and shGα12 (388313): 5¢GAGACCATCGTCAACAACA3¢
were purchased from Open Biosystems (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, AL, USA), and used to knockdown the protein
expression of Gα12 in ORL48 cells, essentially following
the lentivirus production method as stated above. Viral
titration efficiency was evaluated under a fluorescence
microscope (Olympus, Japan) to determine the percentage
of cells expressing GFP. Transduced cells were selected
using 7 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) and
maintained thereafter in medium containing puromycin.

Western blotting
Cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer (0.5%
NaDOC, 0.1% SDS, 25mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.3 M NaCl,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5
mM DTT, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1mM Na3VO4)
supplemented with 1x HALT protease inhibitor cocktail
(Pierce Biotechnology, IL, USA). Cell lysates were
collected after centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 5 minutes
at 4ºC. The concentration of total protein in the cell lysate
was determined using Bradford protein assay (Pierce
Biotechnology, IL, USA). 50 μg of total protein was
subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore,
MA, USA). Blots were blocked with 5% skimmed
milk (TBS with 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 hour and further
incubated with the following primary antibodies: antiGα12 (sc-409; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA),
anti-Gα13 (sc-410; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA)
and anti-α-tubulin (T9026; Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA), at
a 1:1000 dilution for 1 hour. Blots were washed (x3 for 5
minutes each) in TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20
(TBS-T) and then probed with respective secondary
antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase
(dilution 1:10,000; SouthernBiotech, AL, USA) for
1 hour. After washing (TBS-T), detection was performed
via enhanced chemiluminescence method, using the
ChemiImagerTM Imaging System (Alpha Innotech, USA).
Quantification of protein bands was performed using the
ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). The relative
intensity of target proteins was calibrated against α-tubulin
and then compared to the control for each experiment.

Cell proliferation
Cells were seeded at 2x104 density in 6-well plates,
and cultured for up to 7 days. Cell counts were performed
every 24 hours using the CASY cell counter (Innovatis
AG, Reutlingen, Germany), according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Each experiment was performed in triplicates,
and mean cell counts were compared to the respective
vector controls across different time intervals.

Scratch assay
Scratch assays were performed as previously
described [50]. In brief, cells were seeded at 4x105 cells/ml
and cultured for 48 hours to form a confluent monolayer.
Cells were then treated with 10 μg/ml mitomycin C for
2 hours to inhibit cell proliferation. A scratch was made
through the monolayer with a P200 pipette tip by applying
constant pressure to create an open wound. Cells were
rinsed with PBS and cultured in DMEM/F-12 complete
medium and open wound areas were microscopically
recorded between 0 to 18 hours. Images of open
wounds were then analyzed using the TScratch analysis
software [51].

(PET) membrane of 8 μm pore size (BD Biosciences,
MA, USA). Cells were serum-starved for 18 hours and
detached with Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, Auckland, NZ).
Then, 1x105 cells were suspended in serum-free medium
and added to the upper chambers of the Transwell inserts
and 3T3 cell-conditioned medium or medium containing
1U/ml thrombin was used as chemoattractant in the lower
chamber. After 48 hours of incubation at 37ºC, cells in
the upper surface of the membranes were removed with
a cotton swab. The membranes were fixed with 4%
formaldehyde for 15 minutes and stained with 0.2% crystal
violet for 10 minutes, and further rinsed with water. The
membranes were detached from the inserts and mounted
onto glass slides using DPX mountant. Stained cells were
counted in 4 randomly chosen microscopic fields per insert
at 200x magnification and average value of 3 biological
replicates was obtained.
Cell invasion was assayed with Biocoat Matrigel
24-well invasion chamber (BD Biosciences, MA, USA)
according to the method described for the Transwell
migration assay, with the exception that inserts were precoated with matrigel basement matrix (BD Biosciences,
MA, USA).

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software. Gα12
mRNA levels in OSCC and NOM tissues were compared
using the Mann-Whitney U test. The receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the
cut-off point for the IHC scoring of Gα12 expression
in differentiating the tumors from the NOM tissues.
Fisher-exact test was used to study the association
between Gα12 protein expression in OSCC and various
clinicopathological parameters. Independent t-test was
used to analyze the differences in in vitro cell proliferation,
invasion and migration, as well as in in vivo experiments
comparing the tumor volume and LN involvement
between the two groups of animals.

Animal studies
All animal studies were carried out according
to National Institutes of Health-approved protocols
in compliance with the guide for the care and use of
laboratory animals. Female NOD/SCID mice (NCI,
Frederick, MD, USA) at 4–6 weeks of age were used
in this study. Mice were housed in appropriate sterile
filter-capped cages, and fed and watered ad libitum.
The orthotopic tongue model was established based on
a previous study by Patel and colleagues [22]. Briefly,
1x105 ORL48/GFP and ORL48/RGS cells previously
sorted for GFP by FACS were injected into the posterior
tongue. Mice were evaluated every other day for general
behavioral abnormalities, signs of illness or discomfort.
Body weights of the animals were recorded and tumor
measurements were given visually by the same operator
for the duration of the study. Mice were euthanized on
day 20 and the neck area of each mouse was carefully
dissected under a Discovery V12 Stereo microscope
(Zeiss, Thornwood NY, USA) to retrieve 4 to 5 cervical
lymph nodes. Next, the tongues for each mouse in each
group were resected. The resected tissues were fixed in
formalin overnight and then transferred to 70% alcohol
and processed for paraffin embedding for histopathological
evaluation by a pathologist (AAM). H&E-stained slides
from primary tumors were acquired with an Aperio CS
Scanscope (Aperio, Vista, CA, USA) at 40x magnification.
Tumor volume was determined using the formula: LW2/2;
where L and W represent length and the width of the
tumor respectively.
