ABSTRACT
Recent clinical data indicate a synergistic therapeutic effect between trastuzumab
and taxanes in neoadjuvantly treated HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) patients. In
HER2+ BC experimental models and patients, we investigated whether this synergy
depends on the ability of drug-induced stress to improve NK cell effectiveness and
thus trastuzumab-mediated ADCC. HER2+ BC cell lines BT474 and MDAMB361 treated
with docetaxel showed up-modulation of NK activator ligands both in vitro and in
vivo, accompanied by a 15–40% increase in in vitro trastuzumab-mediated ADCC;
antibodies blocking the NKG2D receptor significantly reduced this enhancement. NKG2D
receptor expression was increased by docetaxel treatment in circulating and splenic
NK cells from mice xenografted with tumor cells, an increase related to expansion
of the CD11b+Ly6G+ cell population. Accordingly, NK cells derived from HER2+ BC
patients after treatment with taxane-containing therapy expressed higher levels of
NKG2D receptor than before treatment. Moreover, plasma obtained from these patients
recapitulated the modulation of NKG2D on healthy donors’ NK cells, improving their
trastuzumab-mediated activity in vitro. This enhancement occurred mainly using
plasma from patients with low NKG2D basal expression. Our results indicate that
taxanes increase tumor susceptibility to ADCC by acting on tumor and NK cells, and
suggest that taxanes concomitantly administered with trastuzumab could maximize the
antibody effect, especially in patients with low basal immune effector cytotoxic activity.

Moreover, data from the NCCTG N9831 trial suggest that
trastuzumab is more effective if used concurrently with
rather than following the taxane component of adjuvant
chemotherapy [4]. However, the mechanism(s) underlying
this synergy remains unclear, prompting investigations
to further define trastuzumab killing activity when
administered with chemotherapy.
Several preclinical studies have indicated that
trastuzumab anti-tumor activity depends on several direct
or indirect cytostatic and cytotoxic activities [5;6]. The

INTRODUCTION
Trastuzumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal
antibody directed to the extracellular domain of the
HER2 protein, is the paradigm of tailored treatment for
patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Recent clinical
data indicated a synergistic therapeutic effect between
trastuzumab and chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting
in these patients, with up to 70% pathological complete
response [1] and especially when taxanes are used [2;3].

importance of immune cells in trastuzumab therapy is
supported by studies showing that ADCC contributes
mainly to the antitumor effects of trastuzumab in HER2positive tumors in mice [7] and in breast carcinoma preoperative clinical studies, in which it was associated with
increased tumor infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells
[8;9]. NK cells play a key role in trastuzumab-mediated
ADCC [10] and, if stimulated, enhance trastuzumab
efficacy [11]. The NK cell detection system, in addition
to the low-affinity Fc receptor CD16, which permits
NK cells to kill antibody-coated target cells, includes a
variety of cell surface activating and inhibitory receptors,
the engagement of which by ligands expressed on tumor
cells regulates immune effector cell activities. A key
receptor for NK cell activation is NK Group 2 member
D (NKG2D), a type II transmembrane C-type lectinlike receptor expressed on all NK cells. It binds multiple
ligands, including MHC class I chain-related A (MICA),
MICB and several UL-16 binding proteins (ULBPs),
which are induced after cellular stress [12] and are the
most common ligands for NK cell receptors in breast
carcinomas together with DNAM-1 ligands [13].
In this study, we investigated in HER2-positive
breast carcinoma models the effect of taxane treatment
on expression levels of ADCC-associated factors with
a focus on NKG2D ligands, and correlated the changes
in these molecules with the ability of trastuzumab to
mediate ADCC. Moreover, we investigated the effect of
chemotherapy on NK cells in xenografted mice and in
HER2-positive breast carcinoma patients treated with
neoadjuvant therapy.

to untreated cells. Similar results were obtained for soluble
MICA in BT474 but not in MDAMB361 culture medium,
where soluble MICA was never detectable.
To test whether NK cell stimulatory ligands are also
up-modulated by docetaxel in vivo, SCID mice bearing
MDAMB361 tumors in the mammary fat pad were treated
intravenously with 20 mg/Kg docetaxel or not treated and
analyzed 24 hours later for expression of MICA and ULBP2
by Western blotting on cells obtained from disaggregated
tumors. Levels of MICA ligand were significantly higher in
tumors derived from docetaxel-treated than untreated mice
(Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S2).

NKG2D ligand expression and susceptibility to
trastuzumab-mediated ADCC
To test whether increased expression of NKG2D
ligands observed on breast carcinoma cells after treatment
with docetaxel enhances trastuzumab-mediated cell
cytotoxity, tumor cells were analyzed in 51Cr-release assays
using human PBMCs from healthy donors as effector
cells. Docetaxel treatment for 6 hours rendered BT474 and
MDAMB361 target cells more sensitive to trastuzumabdependent ADCC, with an average killing increase of 38%
in BT474 (Figure 2A) and 14% in MDAMB361 (Figure 2B)
cells. This ADCC increment was significantly inhibited in
both cell lines by antibo­dies blocking the NKG2D receptor
(Figure 2C, 2D), supporting the role of the NKG2D ligandreceptor interaction in increasing trastuzumab-mediated
ADCC upon chemotherapy. Comparable results were
obtained in BT474 target cells treated with docetaxel for 12
hours, whereas a trend toward inhibition of trastuzumabmediated killing was found in BT474 and MDAMB361
cells treated with docetaxel for 72 hours as compared
with untreated controls (Supplementary Figure S3), when
NKG2D ligand expression was lower in treated than in
untreated cells (Figure 1).
To further demonstrate the direct role of NKG2D
in trastuzumab-mediated ADCC of HER2 positive breast
carcinoma cells, PBMCs from healthy donors were
collected, treated with prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) for
24 hours to force NKG2D down-modulation [13], and
used in ADCC assay against BT474 cells. The induced
reduction of NKG2D expression on NK cells (Figure 2E)
led to a reduced killing of BT474 cells in the presence of
trastuzumab compared to untreated PBMCs (Figure 2F).

RESULTS
Modulation of NKG2D ligand cell surface
expression in response to docetaxel
To investigate whether docetaxel upregulates the
production of the NK cell stimulatory ligands MICA,
MICB, ULBP1 and ULBP2 of the NKG2D receptor,
HER2-overexpressing human breast carcinoma cell lines
BT474 and MDAMB361 were treated in vitro for different
times with 100 nM docetaxel and analyzed by flow
cytometry. Docetaxel-treated cells revealed a significant
increase in membrane-associated ligand expression as a
rapid and dynamic event, with the greatest enhancement
within 6–12 hours and a return to basal levels within 24–
48 hours (Figure 1A, 1B). Longer drug treatment increased
the soluble forms of MICA and ULBP2, the two molecules
reportedly cleaved and released into the extracellular
space as negative feedback ligand-mediated NK regulation
[14], in culture medium of breast carcinoma cells at 48 and
72 hours after docetaxel treatment compared to untreated
cells (Supplementary Figure S1), partly explaining their
reduction on the cell membrane. Specifically, soluble
ULBP2 amounts increased in both cell lines as compared

Increased expression of NKG2D in circulating
NK cells in mice receiving chemotherapy
The activity of docetaxel on effector cells was
analyzed by comparing the phenotype of NK cells
obtained from MDAMB361 tumor-bearing mice with
that of tumor-free mice upon docetaxel treatment. No
differences in NKG2D expression on NK cells were
observed at 24 hours after treatment (not shown), whereas
256

NKG2D expression was significantly higher in NK cells
derived from chemotherapy-treated than saline-treated
tumor-bearing mice 6 days after treatment (Figure 3A).
Chemotherapy treatment impaired the proportion of NK
cells only in tumor-bearing mice (Figure 3B). Notably,
NKG2D expression did not differ in NK cells derived from
tumor-free mice irrespective of treatment, suggesting that
the presence of the tumor is necessary for up-modulation
of NKG2D levels in NK cells upon chemotherapy.
To determine whether the increase in NKG2D
was directly induced by tumor cells after treatment with
chemotherapy, PBMCs obtained from healthy donors
were cultured with supernatants conditioned by BT474
cells treated or not with docetaxel. No modulation of
NKG2D expression was found in NK cells conditioned
by supernatant of BT474 cells treated or not with
docetaxel (Figure 3C) or co-cultured for 24 hours with
BT474 cells in the presence or absence of docetaxel
(Figure 3D). Similar results were observed in NK cells
after 48 hours of co-culture (data not shown). These data
suggest that docetaxel-induced up-modulation of the
NKG2D receptor observed in mice is not directly affected
by tumor cells after treatment with chemotherapy, but is
likely mediated through their interaction with the host
microenvironment.
Based on the reported accumulation of myeloid
cells in tumor-bearing mice and in cancer patients
[15], we investigated the expansion of these cells in
the spleen of mice injected with MDAMB361 cells and
treated with docetaxel or untreated. Docetaxel treatment
led to an increase in the number of CD11b+Ly6G+
cells (granulocytic myeloid cells) as compared to the
number in untreated mice (Figure 4A), whereas similar
numbers of CD11b+Ly6C+ cells (monocytic myeloid
cells) were found in mice irrespective of treatment
(Figure 4B). The percentage of CD49+ cells (NK cells)
and the NKG2D expression on NK cells were lower
and higher, respectively, in treated than in untreated
mice both in blood (Supplementary Figure S4) and in

the spleen (Figure 4C, 4D), raising the possibility that
NKG2D expression in chemotherapy-treated mice is
modulated by an increase in granulocytic myeloid cells
that expand only in the presence of tumors. Analysis
of purified myeloid cells (GR1+) from mice treated or
not with docetaxel and co-cultured at a 1:1 ratio with
splenocytes derived from tumor-free mice indicated that
NKG2D relative expression on NK cells was increased,
irrespective of docetaxel treatment of mice from which
they were purified (Figure 4E). Thus, the higher number
of myeloid cells found in mice treated with docetaxel
than in untreated mice might explain the increased
NKG2D expression on NK cells.

Increased expression of NKG2D in circulating
NK cells of patients receiving chemotherapy
Based on the results obtained in preclinical models,
we investigated the NK cell phenotype in patients with
HER2-positive breast carcinomas treated with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and trastuzumab. Analysis of the NK
phenotype in PBMCs obtained from 9 patients before
(pre) and after (post) the first chemotherapy treatment
cycle (4 cycles of taxane-based chemotherapy) showed
that treatment slightly impaired NK cell proportions
(Figure 5A), in particular CD16+ NK cells (Figure 5B), but
significantly increased NKG2D expression on NK cells
(Figure 5C). Note that other natural cytotoxicity receptors
involved in human NK activity (i.e., NKp30, NKp44 and
NKp46) were not significantly modified by chemotherapy
(Supplementary Figure S5). Thus, chemotherapy appears
to change the NK cell surface receptor configuration in
patients with HER2-positive breast carcinomas. Moreover,
healthy donor PBMCs cultured for 24 hours with plasma
obtained from patients post-treatment showed significant
up-modulation of NKG2D on NK cells compared to
plasma collected pre-treatment (Figure 5D), indicating
that the plasma treatment recapitulated the drug-induced
up-modulation of NKG2D on NK cells.

corresponding pre-treatment plasma (Figure 6B), which
had the lowest basal activity (Figure 6A). Notably, the
trastuzumab-mediated ADCC induced by NK cells after
treatment with P5 post-treatment plasma increased
to levels similar to those obtained with NK cells after
P1 pre-treatment plasma (Figure 6B). These data
suggest that the benefit of chemotherapy in improving
trastuzumab-mediated ADCC occurs mainly in patients
with low basal cytotoxic activity of immune effector
cells, and that addition of chemotherapy to antibody
administration may not be as relevant in improving
trastuzumab activity for patients with elevated basal
lytic activity of effector cells. Consistent with this view,
NKG2D basal expression in a new series of 18 HER2positive breast cancer patients before neoadjuvant
treatment with one cycle of trastuzumab alone [16] and
analyzed by qPCR using RNA obtained from the buffycoat of collected blood was higher in tumors that benefit
from the antibody, evaluated as at least 20% reduction
in the standardized uptake value evaluated by FDG PET/
CT scan (Figure 6C), than in non-responsive tumors (p
= 0.0249). Moreover, patients that reached a pCR at
the end of the neoadjuvant treatment with trastuzumab
and docetaxel showed higher basal NKG2D expression
than did partial responders with borderline statistical
significance (Figure 6D, p = 0.0806); the two patients of
the INT cohort with the highest NKG2D were those with

To determine whether enhanced NKG2D
expression after chemotherapy is associated with
improved NK cell function in the context of breast
cancer, PBMCs obtained from healthy donors were
treated with plasma from patients and used in ADCC
assay. Treatment of PBMCs from healthy donors with
pre-treatment plasma from different patients induced
different ADCC ability of the same PBMC (Figure
6A), and the mean cytotoxic activity of effector cells
correlated with NKG2D expression evaluated on NK
cells (r = 0.86, p = 0.06). Interestingly, the lower the
PBMC lytic activity induced by pre-treatment plasma,
the higher the fold-increase in PBMC ADCC activity
induced by post-treatment versus pre-treatment
plasma (Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure  S6).
Indeed, treatment of PBMCs from healthy donors
with patient P1 post-treatment plasma, which induced
the highest expression of NKG2D on NK cells and, in
turn, the highest trastuzumab-mediated ADCC before
chemotherapy, did not induce a significant increment in
trastuzumab-mediated ADCC compared to pre-treatment
plasma (Figure 6B). By contrast, post-treatment plasma
derived from patient P5 induced an increment in NKG2D
expression and consequently of ADCC compared to the

increasing trastuzumab-mediated ADCC observed here is
in agreement with the increased activity of an anti-ERBB2NKG2D ligand fusion protein targeting HER2 tumors and
triggering lymphocytes that express the NKG2D receptor
compared to anti-HER2 antibody alone in preclinical models
[19].
Since chemotherapy is known to cause bone marrow
suppression that manifests as reduced numbers of peripheral
blood immune cells [20], we also evaluated its effect on
ADCC effector cells. Although the percentage of NK cells
was slightly reduced by chemotherapy, NKG2D expression
on NK cells was increased after docetaxel treatment.
While NKG2D up-modulation upon drug treatment was
strictly dependent on the presence of tumor cells in mice,
such cells do not appear to play a direct role in enhancing
NKG2D expression, since no direct modulation of NKG2D
on NK cells was observed by co-culturing PBMCs
with tumor cells according to treatment with docetaxel.
However, we did found that NKG2D up-modulation on
NK cells after chemotherapy treatment involves the host
microenvironment, specifically granulocytic myeloid cells,
as indicated by the increase of NKG2D on NK cells after
co-culture of GR1+CD11b+ cells with splenocytes derived
from healthy mice. Indeed, neutrophils have been reported

a pCR after chemotherapy and trastuzumab treatment (p
= 0.0142).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we report for the first time that
taxanes significantly increase NKG2D ligand expression on
tumor cells and their susceptibility to NK activity. Moreover,
docetaxel induces the expression of the activating cognate
receptor NKG2D on NK cells, increasing their cytotoxic
activity mediated by trastuzumab.
The up-modulation of NKG2D ligands by
chemotherapy is consistent with the function of these
ligands, whose expression is generally linked to cellular
stress mechanisms that induce danger signals [17]. Based
on the demonstrated role of NKG2D signals in inducing NK
activation favoring NK degranulation rather than adhesion
to tumor cells [18] during ADCC, the induced trastuzumab
activity after chemotherapy treatment observed in our model
is likely due to the interaction between NKG2D ligands with
their receptor, as supported by the ability of anti-NKG2D
receptor antibodies to abrogate the chemotherapy-induced
increase of in vitro trastuzumab-dependent ADCC. The
involvement of the NKG2D ligand/receptor interaction in

to play a role in regulating differentiation and activation
of NK cells [21]. Moreover, the selective expansion of
CD11b+Ly6G+and the increase in NKG2D expression
on NK cells in our models upon docetaxel treatment is
consistent with the elevation of granulocytic myeloid
cells after chemotherapy in patients [22], and with the
increase in GM-CSF and IL6 production, that supports
myeloid cell expansion, as well as the increased NK cell
cytotoxic activity demonstrated upon taxane treatment
in human patients [23]. We speculate that tumor cells
after chemotherapy treatment modulate the production
of soluble factors that induce expansion of myeloid cells
[24;25], as we observed in breast cancer cell lines in vitro
after chemotherapy treatment (not shown). Myeloid cells,
in turn, could sense chemotherapy and increase expression
of NKG2D ligands described to induce NK activity when
expressed on myeloid cells [26]. Because docetaxel is also
able to induce NKG2D ligand expression in tumor cells,
the interaction between tumor NKG2D ligands and NKG2D

receptor expressed by NK cells significantly improves
trastuzumab-mediated ADCC. Although the modulation
of the NKG2D ligand/receptor could be coincidental,
our findings open the door to further research aimed at
harnessing the power of the modulation of both elements
for improving therapy. Moreover, our results obtained
regarding NKG2D raise the possibility that other activating
receptors and co-regulators such as DNAM-1, described to
be involved in breast cancer-NK cell recognition [13], are
involved in increasing trastuzumab activity in humans and
await further investigation.
Our data obtained in experimental models support
the notion that chemotherapy causes modifications
important for inducing an increase in trastuzumabmediated cytotoxicity and consequent response of
patients to treatment. Thus, while trastuzumab might also
augment chemotherapy-induced tumor toxicity, causing
attenuation of DNA repair activity and increasing
apoptosis [27], our results strongly suggest that the

reported synergy between trastuzumab and docetaxel
in HER2-positive breast cancer patients and in nude
mice bearing HER2-expressing tumors and treated with
the two drugs in combination [27;28] depends on the
increased ADCC rather than on the inhibition of HER2mediated DNA repair by the antibody. Indeed, taxanes,
drugs that showed the best therapeutic effect when
combined with trastuzumab [2;29], presumably act as
inhibitors of microtubules rather than as intercalants of
the DNA and are thus unlikely to promote DNA repair
mechanisms involving HER2. However, since recent
evidence suggests that taxane can also induce breaks
in single-strand DNA [30], it is possible that such a
mechanism also contributes to the synergy between
trastuzumab and taxane. The up-modulation of NKG2D
in NK cells of breast carcinoma patients after treatment
with taxane-containing chemotherapy further supports
the relevance of drug treatment in improving the ability
of trastuzumab to trigger host immune effectors against
tumor cells. Thus, the evidence that taxanes significantly
increase tumor susceptibility to NK activity provides an
avenue to improving the cytotoxic effect of trastuzumab
by injecting the antibody concomitantly with taxanes in
a neo-adjuvant setting. Such a protocol could also reduce
the duration of therapy.
Although based on a small subset of patients, our
data suggest that the benefit of taxanes in improving
trastuzumab-mediated ADCC occurs mainly in patients
with low basal cytotoxic activity of their immune
effector cells and with potentially low responsiveness
to trastuzumab-mediated ADCC. Indeed, the meager
enhancement of NKG2D after chemotherapy recorded
in women with elevated basal NKG2D expression does
not appear to support the relevance of chemotherapy in
improving trastuzumab activity in patients with innate
high lytic activity of effector cells, consistent with results
obtained in the TRUP cohort that showed high expression
levels of NKG2D on NK cells from patients responsive to
one cycle of trastuzumab alone. Since patients with high
NKG2D expression on NK cells before any treatment are
also those who reached a pCR in the TRUP and the INT
cohorts, it remains to be determined whether trastuzumab
alone might be sufficient for a pCR in such patients or
whether the addition of chemotherapy is always necessary
to generate a long-lasting response. In this context, the
validation of NKG2D expression levels on circulating NK
cells from patients before any treatment as a predictive
marker of trastuzumab response could represent a simple
tool for the selection of patients who will benefit from the
addition of taxanes to antibody administration.
The relevance of circulating NKG2D-positive NK
cells as indicators of antibody therapy success is strengthened
by results of Fisher and coworkers [31], who showed that
circulating NK cells able to mediate ADCC specifically
express NKG2D, but not NKp30 or NKp46 activating
receptors. Activated NK cells are known to shape the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

adaptive immune response [32;33], described to be crucial for
the complete eradication of BC upon trastuzumab treatment
both in preclinical [34;35] and clinical samples [36;37].
Differences in the patients’ adaptive immunity activation
or recruitment could explain the variable clinical response
of patients observed after treatment with trastuzumab
and chemotherapy, despite the modulation of NKG2D by
chemotherapy observed in all treated patients.
Together, our data indicate that the synergy between
taxanes and trastuzumab occurs mainly through the NKG2D
ligand/receptor-mediated activation of NK cells and mainly
in those patients with low NKG2D expression on effector
cells at the time of diagnosis. The understanding of the
mechanism through which NKG2D levels on NK cells
are increased promises to help in improving trastuzumab
activity through immunotherapy combinations for those
patients who do not respond to treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and treatments
Human HER2-positive breast carcinoma cell
lines MDAMB361 and BT474 (American Type Culture
Collection) were authenticated using the Short Tandem
Repeat Profiling method in our Institute facility and
maintained in appropriate medium supplemented with 10%
(v/v) FBS (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and
L-glutamine in a 5% CO2 humidified chamber at 37°C. Cells
were treated in complete medium with 100 nM docetaxel
(DOCETAXEL, Sanofi Aventis) for different times.

Mice and treatments
Six- to 8-week-old SCID mice (Charles River, Calco,
Italy) were maintained in laminar-flow rooms at constant
temperature and humidity, with food and water given ad
libitum. Mice were injected into the mammary fat pad with
5x106 MDAMB361 cells in growth medium diluted 1:1 with
Matrigel (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA). Experimental
protocols used for animal studies were approved by the Ethics
Committee for Animal Experimentation of Fondazione
IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei tumori of Milan in accordance
with institutional guidelines.
Docetaxel was administered (20 mg/Kg)
intravenously. Spleen and blood were collected from mice
after treatment, and single-cell suspensions obtained after
lysis of red blood cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Myeloid cells were purified from total splenocytes using
biotinylated anti-GR1 antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, San
Diego, CA, USA) as described [38].

Patients
Breast carcinoma core biopsies were obtained
from 8 patients (INT cohort) before a treatment protocol
262

Oncotarget

consisting of 3 or 4 cycles of AT (adriamycin plus taxotere)
followed by 4 cycles of CMF (cyclophosphamide,
methotrexate and fluorouracil) and trastuzumab at
Fondazione IRCCS, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of
Milan. Blood samples of these patients were collected at
two time points during neoadjuvant treatment: pre, before
any treatment; post, after AT cycles.
Eighteen buffy-coats of the “trastuzumab upfront
in HER2-positive locally advanced breast cancer”
(TRUP) cohort deriving from the recent prospective
neoadjuvant study [16] were obtained from patients
before any treatment. Patients were treated with one
cycle of trastuzumab alone followed by 4 cycles of
taxotere and trastuzumab. Tumor dimensions on posttherapy day 21 were measured by FDG PET/CT scan.
Pathological complete response (pCR) was defined as
no residual invasive tumor or in situ carcinoma in the
primary tumor and in the nodes. Human peripheral blood
and tumor specimens were obtained at Fondazione IRCCS
Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan and A.O. Istituti
Ospitalieri di Cremona after written informed consent
from patients in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration
and after institutional approval from our ethics committee
(Comitato Etico Indipendente, Fondazione IRCCS, Istituto
Nazionale dei Tumori) for the conduct of the study.

incubation with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 448-conjugated
reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). Samples were
analyzed by gating on live cells using the FACSCanto
system (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) and BD
FACSDiva™ software (BD Bioscience).
PBMCs isolated from patients or healthy
donors were analyzed using monoclonal antibodies to
human antigens, including PE-anti-CD16 (3G8, BD
Bioscience), PECy5-anti-CD56 (B159, BD Bioscience),
APC-eFluor780-anti-CD3 (SK7, eBioscence, San Diego,
CA, USA), FITC-anti-CD69 (FN50, BD Bioscience)
and APC-NKG2D (ON72, Beckman Coulter, Miami,
FL, USA).
Total splenocytes or purified Gr1+ myeloid
cells from mouse spleens were analyzed using mouse
monoclonal antibodies, including PE-anti-CD49b (DX5,
eBioscience), APC-anti-NKG2D (CX5, eBioscience),
PE-anti-CD11 (MI/70, BD Bioscience), FITC-anti-Ly6G
(1A8, Mylteni Biotec) and APC-anti-Ly6C (HK1.4,
eBioscience). Samples were analyzed by gating on
physical parameters using the FACSCanto II system
(Becton-Dickinson) and FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc,
San Carlos, CA, USA).

Western blotting

Breast carcinoma cells were treated or not (controls)
with docetaxel (100 nM) for 6, 12 or 72 hours and labeled
with 100 μCi 51Cr (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA)
for 1 hour at 37°C. After 3 washes with PBS-5% FBS,
cells were co-incubated for 4 hours at 37°C with PBMCs
isolated by density-gradient separation using FicollPaque PLUS (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ,
USA) from healthy donors (effector:target ratio 50:1) in
200 μl RPMI 1640 complete medium (Gibco, Waltham,
MA, USA) in triplicate 96-well U-bottomed plates in
the presence of saturating concentrations of trastuzumab
(4 μg/ml). NKG2D (1 μg/ml; R&D Systems) was used
in blocking experiments. Radioactivity of the supernatant
was measured with a Trilux Beta Scintillation Counter
(Perkin-Elmer). Percent specific lysis was calculated as:
100 × (experimental cpm – spontaneous cpm)/ (maximum
cpm – spontaneous cpm).

Cytotoxicity assays

Protein fractions were extracted from tumors
grown in athymic mice and analyzed by Western blotting
as described [39]. Antibodies used were: anti-vinculin
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-MICA and
anti-ULBP2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from buffy-coats with
Qiazol® (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer‘s
instructions. cDNAs were reverse-transcribed from 1
μg of total RNA in a 20-μl volume with SuperScript III
(Invitrogen) using random-hexamer primers. qRT-PCR
was performed using Applied Biosystem Taqman assays
(CD16: Hs.04334165_m1, NKG2D: Hs.00183683_m1)
on the ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). NKG2D
expression levels were calculated by the comparative
Ct method using CD16 as reference gene and RNA
obtained from a healthy donor buffy-coat as reference
sample.

ELISA assay
Soluble MICA and ULBP2 were quantified in
breast carcinoma cell supernatants using DuoSet ELISA
kits (R&D Systems), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cell culture supernatants were collected
at different time points after treatment with docetaxel
and stored at -80°C until use. ELISA detection was
performed using 100 μl of each supernatant. Soluble
ligand quantification was normalized to the number
of cells still present in culture as assessed by SRB
colorimetric assay.

Flow cytometry
MDAMB361 and BT474 cells were exposed to
docetaxel (100 nM) for 6 to 72 hours or left untreated,
collected and incubated at 4°C with anti-MICA, -MICB,
-ULBP1, -ULBP2 (R&D Systems), followed by
