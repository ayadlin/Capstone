Abstract
We analyzed the gene expression profiles of clinical lung carcinomas using a cDNA microarray containing
27,648 genes or expressed sequence tags, and identified CDCA5 (cell division cycle associated 5) to be upregulated in the majority of lung cancers. Tumor tissue microarray analysis of 262 non–small cell lung cancer
patients revealed that CDCA5 positivity was an independent prognostic factor for lung cancer patients. Suppression of CDCA5 expression with siRNAs inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells; concordantly, induction
of exogenous expression of CDCA5 conferred growth-promoting activity in mammalian cells. We also found
that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase phosphorylated CDCA5 at Ser79 and Ser209 in vivo.
Exogenous expression of phospho-mimicking CDCA5 protein whose Ser209 residue was replaced with glutamine acid further enhanced the growth of cancer cells. In addition, functional inhibition of the interaction
between CDCA5 and ERK kinase by a cell-permeable peptide corresponding to a 20-amino-acid sequence part
of CDCA5, which included the Ser209 phosphorylation site by ERK, significantly reduced phosphorylation of
CDCA5 and resulted in growth suppression of lung cancer cells. Our data suggest that transactivation of
CDCA5 and its phosphorylation at Ser209 by ERK play an important role in lung cancer proliferation, and
that the selective suppression of the ERK-CDCA5 pathway could be a promising strategy for cancer therapy.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death
worldwide, as 1.3 million patients die annually (1). Despite
the recent development of surgical techniques combined
with various treatment modalities, such as radiotherapy
and chemotherapy, the overall 5-year survival rate of lung
cancer is still only 15% (1). Newly developed cytotoxic agents
have emerged to offer multiple therapeutic options for patients with advanced non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC);
however, each of the new regimens can provide only modest
survival benefits compared with conventional platinumbased therapies (2). Although many genetic alterations in-

volved in the development and/or progression of lung cancer have been reported, the molecular mechanism is not
fully elucidated (3). Hence, novel therapeutic strategies
based on the precise molecular pathology of lung cancer,
such as the development of molecular-targeted agents, nucleic acid drugs, and antibodies, as well as cancer vaccines,
are eagerly awaited.
Systematic analysis of expression levels of thousands of
genes on a cDNA microarray is an effective approach for
identifying molecules involved in carcinogenic pathways
(4); some of the upregulated genes or their products may
become candidate targets for the development of novel anticancer drugs and tumor biomarkers. To isolate such molecules, we have been analyzing genome-wide expression
profiles of 101 lung cancers, using enriched populations of
tumor cells prepared by laser microdissection (5–9). To verify the biological and clinicopathologic significance of the respective gene products, we have established a screening
system by a combination of tumor tissue microarray analysis of clinical lung cancer materials with RNA interference
(RNAi) technique (10–36). In the course of those systematic
studies, we found that CDCA5 (cell division cycle associated
5; alias Sororin) was overexpressed in a great majority of
lung cancers.
CDCA5 was initially identified as a substrate of anaphasepromoting complex and as a regulator of sister chromatid
cohesion in HeLa and mouse myeloma Nso-1 cells (37, 38).

CDCA5 protein is degraded through anaphase-promoting
complex–dependent ubiquitination in the G1 phase, and is
required for stable binding of cohesion to chromatid (38). Despite these biological studies in a limited number of cell lines,
there has been no report describing the significance of the
activation of CDCA5 in human carcinogenesis and its potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target.
We here report that CDCA5 is indispensable for growth
of cancer cells and is possibly involved in the extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, and that targeting
the CDCA5 and/or the ERK-CDCA5 pathway is likely to be
a promising strategy for the development of new molecularly
targeted drugs for cancer treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and clinical samples
Twenty-three human lung cancer cell lines used in this
study included 19 NSCLC cell lines (A427, A549, NCI-H1373,
LC319, PC-14, PC-3, PC-9, NCI-H1666, NCI-H1781, NCI-H647,
NCI-H226, NCI-H1703, NCI-H2170, NCI-H520, LU61, RERFLC-AI, SK-MES-1, EBC-1, and LX1) and 4 small-cell lung
cancer cell lines (SCLC; DMS114, DMS273, SBC-3, and SBC5; Supplementary Table S1). All cells were grown in monolayers in appropriate medium supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS) and were maintained at 37°C in an atmosphere of humidified air with 5% CO2. Human airway epithelial cells SAEC (Cambrex Bio Science, Inc.) were also included
in the panel of the cells used in this study. Primary lung cancer tissue samples had been obtained earlier with informed
consent, as reported elsewhere (5, 9, 11). All tumors were
staged based on the pathologic tumor-node-metastasis
(pTNM) classification of the International Union Against
Cancer (39). Formalin-fixed primary NSCLCs and adjacent
normal lung tissue samples used for immunostaining on tissue microarrays were obtained from 262 patients undergoing
curative surgery at Hokkaido University and its affiliated hospitals (Sapporo, Japan; please see Supplementary Table S2).
To be eligible for this study, tumor samples were selected
from patients who fulfilled all of the following criteria: (a)
patients with primary NSCLC with histologically confirmed
stage (only pT1 to pT3, pN0 to pN2, and pM0); (b) patients
who underwent curative surgery but did not receive any preoperative treatment; (c) NSCLC patients positive for lymph
node metastasis (pN1, pN2) who were treated with platinumbased adjuvant chemotherapies after surgery, and patients
with pN0 who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapies; and
(d) patients whose clinical follow-up data were available. This
study and the use of all clinical materials mentioned were
approved by individual institutional ethics committees.
Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR
We prepared appropriate dilutions of each single-stranded
cDNA prepared from mRNAs of clinical lung cancer samples,
using the level of β-actin (ACTB) transcript as a quantitative
control. The primer sets for amplification were as follows:
ACTB-F (5′-GAGGTGATAGCATTGCTTTCG-3′) and ACTB-R
(5′-CAAGTCAGTGTACAGGTAAGC-3′); CDCA5-F1 (5′-CGC-

5338

CAGAGACTTGGAAATGT-3′) and CDCA5-R1 (5′-GTTTCTGTTTCTCGGGTGGT-3′). All reactions involved initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes followed by 22 (for ACTB) or
30 (for CDCA5) cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 56°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 60 seconds on a GeneAmp PCR system
9700 (Applied Biosystems).
Northern blot analysis
Human multiple tissue blots (23 normal tissues including
heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney,
pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, leukocyte, stomach, thyroid, spinal cord, lymph
node, trachea, adrenal gland, bone marrow; BD Biosciences
Clontech) were hybridized with a 32P-labeled PCR product
of CDCA5 cDNA. The partial-length cDNA of CDCA5 was prepared by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) using primers
CDCA5-F2 (5′-GCTTGTAAAGTCCTCGGAAAGTT-3′) and
CDCA5-R2 (5′-ATCTCAACTCTGCATCATCTGGT-3′). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing were performed
according to the supplier's recommendations. The blots
were autoradiographed with intensifying screens at −80°C
for 7 days.
Anti-CDCA5 antibody
Plasmids expressing full-length CDCA5 that contained Histagged epitopes at their NH2 termini were prepared using
pET28 vector (Novagen) and primers CDCA5-F3 (5′-CCGGAATTCATGTCTGGGAGGCGAACGCG-3′) and CDCA5-R3
(5′-CCGCTCGAGTTCAACCAGGAGATCAAACTGCTC-3′).
Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli
BL21 codon-plus strain (Stratagene) and purified using
Ni-NTA (Qiagen) according to the supplier's protocol. The
protein was inoculated into rabbits; immune sera were purified on affinity columns according to standard methods.
Affinity-purified anti-CDCA5 antibodies were used for Western blotting as well as immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical studies. We confirmed that the antibody was
specific to CDCA5 on Western blots using lysates from cell
lines that had been transfected with CDCA5 expression vector as well as those from lung cancer cell lines that endogenously expressed CDCA5.
Western blotting
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer: 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 0.5% deoxycholate-Na,
0.1% SDS, plus protease inhibitor (Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
Set III; Calbiochem). We used an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting analysis system (GE Healthcare Biosciences), as described previously (11).
Immunocytochemical analysis
Cultured cells were washed twice with PBS(−), fixed in
4%paraformaldehyde solution for 30 minutes at 37°C, and
then rendered permeable with PBS(−) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 minutes. Before the primary antibody reaction, cells were covered with blocking solution [3% bovine
serum albumin in PBS(−)] for 10 minutes to block nonspecific antibody binding. After cells were incubated with

antibodies to human CDCA5 (generated to recombinant
CDCA5; please see above), Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was added to detect
endogenous CDCA5. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI). Antibody-stained cells were viewed
with a laser-confocal microscope (TSC SP2 AOBS: Leica
Microsystems).
Immunohistochemistry and tissue microarray analysis
To investigate the significance of CDCA5 expression in clinical NSCLCs, we stained tissue sections using ENVISION+ kit/
horseradish peroxidase (HRP; DakoCytomation). Affinitypurified anti-CDCA5 antibody (generated to recombinant
CDCA5; please see above) was added after blocking endogenous peroxidase and proteins, and each section was incubated
with HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody.
Substrate-chromogen was added, and the specimens were
counterstained with hematoxylin. Tumor tissue microarrays
were constructed as published previously, using formalinfixed NSCLCs (40–42). Tissue areas for sampling were selected
based on visual alignment with the corresponding H&Estained sections on slides. Three, four, or five tissue cores
(diameter, 0.6 mm; height, 3–4 mm) taken from donor tumor
blocks were placed into recipient paraffin blocks using a tissue
microarrayer (Beecher Instruments). A core of normal tissue
was punched from each case. Five-micrometer sections of the
resulting microarray block were used for immunohistochemical analysis. Three independent investigators semiquantitatively assessed CDCA5 positivity without prior knowledge of
clinicopathologic data. Because the intensity of staining within each tumor tissue core was mostly homogenous, the intensity of CDCA5 staining in the nucleus and cytoplasm was
evaluated by recording as negative (no appreciable staining
in tumor cells) or positive (brown staining appreciable in
the nucleus and cytoplasm of tumor cells). Cases were accepted as positive if two or more reviewers independently defined
them as such.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were done using the StatView statistical program (SAS). We used contingency tables to correlate
clinicopathologic variables, such as age, gender, and pTNM
stage, with the positivity of CDCA5 protein determined by
tissue microarray analysis. Tumor-specific survival curves
were calculated from the date of surgery to the time of
death related to NSCLC, or to the last follow-up observation.
Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated for each relevant variable and for CDCA5 expression; differences in survival times
among patient subgroups were analyzed using the log-rank
test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed
with the Cox proportional hazard regression model to determine associations between clinicopathologic variables and
cancer-related mortality. First, we analyzed associations between death and possible prognostic factors, including age,
gender, smoking, histologic type, pT classification, and pN
classification, taking into consideration one factor at a time.
Second, multivariate Cox analysis was applied on backward
(stepwise) procedures that always forced strong CDCA5 ex-

pression into the model, along with any and all variables
that satisfied an entry level of a P value <0.05. As the model
continued to add factors, independent factors did not exceed an exit level of P < 0.05. A two-tailed P value of <0.05
was considered statistically significant.
RNAi assay
Two independent CDCA5 siRNA oligonucleotides were designed using CDCA5 sequences (Genbank accession no:
NM080668). siRNAs (600 pmol/L) were transfected into two
NSCLC cell lines, A549 and LC319, using 30 μL of
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were cultured for 7 days.
Cell numbers and viability were measured by Giemsa staining and triplicate MTT assays (cell counting kit-8 solution;
Dojindo Laboratories). The siRNA sequences used were
as follows: control-1 (si-LUC: luciferase gene from Photinus
pyralis), 5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA-3′; control-2 (CNT:
ON-TARGETplus siCONTROL Nontargeting siRNAs a pool
of four oligos: 5′-UGGUUUACAUGUCGACUAA-3′, 5′-UGGUUUACAUGUUUUCUGA-3′, 5′-UGGUUUACAUGUUUUCCUA-3′, and 5′-UGGUUUACAUGUUGUGUGA-3′); siRNACDCA5-#1 (si-CDCA5-#1: 5′-GCAGUUUGAUCUCCUGGUUU3′); siRNA-CDCA5-#2 (si-CDCA5-#2: 5′-GCCAGAGACUUGGAAAUGUUU-3′). Downregulation of endogenous CDCA5
expression in the cell lines by siRNAs for CDCA5, but not
by controls, was confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR and
Western blot analyses.
Cell growth assay
To establish COS-7 cells stably expressing CDCA5, nontagged CDCA5 expression vector (pCAGGSn-CDCA5) or
mock vector (pCAGGSn) was transfected into COS-7 cells
that weakly expressed endogenous CDCA5 using FuGENE6
transfection reagent (Roche). Transfected cells were incubated in the culture medium containing 0.4 mg/mL neomycin
(Geneticin, Invitrogen) for 14 days. Then, 50 colonies were
trypsinized and screened for stable transfectants by a limiting dilution assay. Expression of CDCA5 was determined in
each clone by Western blotting and immunocytochemical
staining. Viability of cells was evaluated by MTT assay at
days 1, 3, 5, and 7.
In vitro kinase assay
We performed in vitro ERK kinase assay using glutathione
S-transferase (GST)–tagged full-length CDCA5 protein
(pGEX-6p-1/CDCA5). Briefly, 1.0 μg each of recombinant
GST-CDCA5, MBP, or GST was incubated in 20 μL of kinase
buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L
EGTA, 2 mmol/L DTT, 0.01% Briji-35, and 1 mmol/L ATP
(pH 7.5) at 25°C] supplemented with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP
(GE Healthcare) and 50 ng of ERK2 kinase (Upstate) for 20
minutes at 30°C. The reactions were terminated with
Laemmli SDS sample buffer to a final volume of 30 μL; half
of the samples were subjected to 5% to 15% gradient gel
(Bio-Rad Laboratories); and phosphorylation was visualized
by autoradiography. MBP was used as a positive substrate
control, and GST was used as a negative control.

To determine in vivo ERK-dependent phosphorylation sites
on CDCA5 in cultured cells, we performed colloidal CBB
staining after immunoprecipitation of exogenously expressed
CDCA5 protein in epidermal growth factor (EGF)–treated
HeLa cells (50 ng/mL for 20 minutes) that were transfected
with both CDCA5-expressing plasmid and ERK2-expressing
plasmid, using anti-CDCA5 antibody. Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were
stained by Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB, R-250; Bio-Rad).
Specific bands corresponding to CDCA5 were digested with
trypsin as described elsewhere (43) and analyzed by matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry analysis (Shimadzu Biotech). Mass spectral data were evaluated
using the Mascot search engine (http://www.matrixscience.
com) to identify proteins from primary sequence databases.
EGF stimulation assay
HeLa cells were cultured in FCS-free medium for 20 hours.
Then, cells were stimulated by 50 ng/mL of EGF with or without 10 μmol/L MEK inhibitor U0126 (Promega).
Synthesized cell-permeable peptide
Amino acid peptide sequences corresponding to a part of
CDCA5 protein that contained Ser209, a site phosphorylated
by ERK, were covalently linked at its NH2 terminus to a membrane transducing 11 poly-arginine (11R) sequence (44).

RRRRRRRRRRR-GGG-TLPGISPPPEKQKRKKKKM; and p209C, RRRRRRRRRRR-GGG-RVCAKPWAPDMTLPGISPPP.
Peptides were purified by preparative reverse-phase highpressure liquid chromatography. A549 and LC319 cells as
well as human lung–derived CCD19-Lu cells were incubated
with the 11R peptides at concentrations of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10
μmol/L for 7 days. The medium was changed every 48 hours
at the appropriate concentrations of each peptide, and viability of cells was evaluated by MTT assay after 7 days of treatment with the peptide.

Results
Expression of CDCA5 in lung cancer and normal tissues
We previously screened 27,648 genes or expressed sequence tags on a cDNA microarray to identify transcripts
showing 3-fold or higher expression in cancer cells than in
normal cells in the majority of clinical lung cancer samples.
Among them, we identified the CDCA5 transcript to be upregulated; its increased expression in all of nine clinical lung
cancer tissues was confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR
experiments, although its expression was hardly detectable
in adjacent normal lung tissues (Fig. 1A). High levels of
CDCA5 expression were also observed in all of the 23 lung

cancer cell lines examined, but the transcript was hardly detectable in SAEC cells derived from normal airway epithelial
cells (Fig. 1B). In addition, we confirmed high levels of endogenous CDCA5 protein by Western blot analysis in lung
cancer cell lines using anti-CDCA5 antibody (Fig. 1C). Subsequent immunofluorescence analysis of lung cancer LC319
cells identified the subcellular localization of endogenous
CDCA5 mainly in the nucleus and weakly in the cytoplasm
(Fig. 1D). Northern blot analysis using a CDCA5 cDNA fragment as a probe identified a 2.8-kb transcript to be highly
expressed in the testis; however, this transcript was hardly
detectable in other normal tissues examined (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, we examined CDCA5 protein in five normal tissues
(heart, lung, liver, kidney, and testis) and lung cancer tissues
by immunohistochemistry using anti-CDCA5 polyclonal antibodies, and detected its abundant expression in the testis as
well as in lung cancer cells, whereas its expression was hardly
detectable in the remaining four normal tissues (Fig. 2B).
Association of CDCA5 expression with poor prognosis
for NSCLC patients
Using tissue microarrays prepared from archived NSCLC
samples from patients who underwent curative surgery, we
performed immunohistochemical analysis with anti-CDCA5
polyclonal antibodies. We classified staining patterns of
CDCA5 expression to be negative or positive as shown in

Fig. 2C. Of the 262 NSCLC cases examined, we judged 192
cases (73.3%) as positive and 70 cases (26.7%) as negative;
no staining was observed in any of their adjacent noncancerous cells (Supplementary Table S3A). We then examined the
association of CDCA5 expression with various clinicopathologic parameters of NSCLC patients, and found a significant
association between CDCA5 positivity in NSCLCs and a
shorter tumor-specific survival period (P = 0.0143 by log-rank
test; Fig. 2D and Supplementary Table S3B). We also applied
univariate analysis to evaluate associations between patient
prognosis and several factors including age, gender, smoking
history, histologic type (adenocarcinoma versus nonadenocarcinoma), pT stage (tumor size; T1 versus T2+T3), pN stage
(node status; N0 versus N1+N2), and CDCA5 status (negative
versus positive expression). All of these parameters were
significantly associated with poor prognosis (Supplementary
Table S3C). Multivariate analysis indicates CDCA5 status to
be an independent prognostic factor for surgically treated lung
cancer patients enrolled in this study (P = 0.0244), similar to
pT and pN stages and age.
Growth-promoting effect of CDCA5
Using siRNA oligonucleotides for CDCA5, we attempted
to knock down the expression of endogenous CDCA5 in
lung cancer cell lines A549 and LC319, which showed high
levels of CDCA5 expression. Two CDCA5-specific siRNAs

(bottom). B, colony formation assays of A549 and LC319 cells transfected with the siRNAs. C, viability of A549 and LC319 cells evaluated by MTT
assay in response to the siRNAs. All assays were performed in triplicate wells three independent times. D, enhancement of growth of COS-7 cells by
exogenous introduction of CDCA5. Cell viability of two stable clones (COS-7–CDCA5-#A and -#B) and two control clones (COS-7–Mock-#A and -#B)
was quantified with the MTT assay at days 1, 3, 5, and 7. All assays were performed in triplicate wells three independent times.

(si-CDCA5-#1 and si-CDCA5-#2) significantly suppressed
expression of CDCA5 in both transcript and protein levels
compared with control siRNAs (si-LUC and si-CNT; Fig. 3A).
Colony formation and MTT assays revealed that reduction
of CDCA5 expression by the two siRNAs significantly suppressed the growth of A549 and LC319 cells (Fig. 3B and C).
To further examine the effect of CDCA5 on growth of mammalian cells, we transfected plasmids designed to express fulllength CDCA5 (pcDNA3.1-CDCA5) or mock plasmids into
COS-7 cells, and established two independent COS-7 cell lines
overexpressing exogenous CDCA5 (COS-7-CDCA5-#A and -#B)
and two control cells (COS-7-Mock-#A and -#B). We then
carried out MTT assay of these COS-7–derived cells and
compared the growth of COS-7–CDCA5 cells with control
COS-7–Mock cells. Growth of the two COS-7–CDCA5
(COS-7–CDCA5-#A and -#B) cells was promoted at a significant degree in accordance with the amount of CDCA5 protein
as detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3D).

Phosphorylation of CDCA5 by ERK kinase
To analyze the function of CDCA5 in carcinogenesis,
we focused on the possible phosphorylation of CDCA5
protein because the in silico approach suggested several
consensus phosphorylation sites on CDCA5 by ERK kinase
[x-x-S/T-P], which is one of the important downstream components in the oncogenic mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathway. We first performed in vitro kinase assay
by incubating rhERK2 with rhCDCA5 and found that CDCA5
was likely to be directly phosphorylated by ERK kinase
(Fig. 4A).
To examine whether CDCA5 was phosphorylated by ERK
in cells, serum-free cultured HeLa cells were stimulated with
50 ng/mL of EGF in the presence or absence of 10 μmol/L of
MEK inhibitor U0126. Western blot analysis using anti-ERK
antibody detected upper-shifted bands that corresponded to
activated phospho-ERK1/2 at 15 and 30 minutes after EGF
stimulation; however, the amount of the upper-shifted band

detected by anti-ERK antibody was decreased at 60 minutes
(Fig. 4B, left panels). In the same condition, increase
in phospho-ERK1/2 level at 15 and 30 minutes after EGF
stimulation and its decrease at 60 minutes were also confirmed by directly detecting phosphorylated ERK using anti–
phospho-ERK antibody. In accordance with the levels of
endogenous ERK phosphorylation, an upper-shifted endogenous CDCA5 band was detected by anti-CDCA5 antibody at
15 and 30 minutes after the EGF stimulation, whereas the
shifted CDCA5 band and activated phospho-ERK levels were
decreased at 60 minutes. On the other hand, treatment of
cells in the presence of U0126, an inhibitor for both EGF
and MEK kinases, blocked ERK phosphorylation as well as

CDCA5 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B, right panels). These results
suggest the possible phosphorylation of endogenous CDCA5
protein in the ERK-dependent pathway.
To examine the ERK-dependent in vivo phosphorylation
sites on CDCA5 in cultured cells, we performed immunoprecipitation assay using anti-CDCA5 antibody and lysates of
EGF-treated or untreated HeLa cells that were transfected

both EGF and U0126, were excised and subjected to mass
spectrometric analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1B); 70%, 77%,
or 66% of the CDCA5 protein were individually analyzed.
We found that Ser79 and Ser209 were ERK-dependently
phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of Ser21 was found in
all three cells, indicating that it is unlikely to be an
ERK-dependent phosphorylation site in vivo (data not
shown). To confirm the results of this mass spectrometric
analysis, we performed Western blot analysis using HeLa
cells transfected with vectors expressing wild-type or mutant CDCA5 protein whose Ser79 and/or Ser209 residues
were replaced with alanine (CDCA5-S79A, CDCA5-S209A,
and CDCA5-S79A/S209A). Myc/His-tagged ERK2-expressing
vector was cotransfected with either wild-type or mutant
CDCA5-expressing vector under the same conditions
with/without EGF treatment as described above. Uppershifted bands were detected in lanes corresponding to
wild-type and two mutant CDCA5 proteins (CDCA5-S79A
and CDCA5-S209A) after EGF stimulation, whereas no
shifted band was detected in those corresponding to the
mutant CDCA5 (CDCA5-S79A/S209A) containing double
substitutions (Fig. 4C). Using anti–phospho-Ser209-CDCA5
antibody, phosphorylation of both ERK2 and Ser209 of
CDCA5 after EGF stimulation was detected in lanes
corresponding to wild type CDCA5 and CDCA5-S79A, but
not in those corresponding to CDCA5-S209A or CDCA5S79A/S209A. In addition, CDCA5-S79A and CDCA5-S209A
seemed to be smaller compared with wild-type CDCA5.
These results indicate that both Ser79 and Ser209 are likely
to be phosphorylated by ERK kinase in cells.
Growth-promoting effect of CDCA5 phosphorylation
at Ser209
To examine whether ERK-dependent phosphorylation of
CDCA5 could play important roles in lung carcinogenesis,

5344

Cancer Res; 70(13) July 1, 2010

we transfected into LC319 and A549 cells plasmids expressing nontagged phospho-mimicking CDCA5 protein whose
Ser79 or Ser209 residue was replaced with a glutamine acid
(CDCA5-S79E and CDCA5-S209E). We found by MTT assay
that growth of cells expressing phospho-mimicking CDCA5
at Ser209, but not those expressing Ser79 phospho-mimicking
CDCA5, was significantly faster than those expressing wildtype CDCA5 (Fig. 5A and B). The results could strongly suggest that phosphorylation of Ser209 of CDCA5 plays a pivotal
role in cancer cell growth.
Growth inhibition of lung cancer cells by cellpermeable peptides
To investigate the functional significance of Ser209 phosphorylation on CDCA5 protein by ERK for growth or survival
of lung cancer cells, we developed bioactive cell-permeable
peptides that were expected to inhibit the in vivo phosphorylation of CDCA5 by ERK. We synthesized three different
peptides that included the Ser209 phosphorylation site on
CDCA5 protein. These peptides were covalently linked at
its NH2 terminus to a membrane transducing 11 arginine residues (11R). We first investigated the inhibition of these
three p209-CDCA5 peptides on the phosphorylation level of
Ser209-CDCA5 by ERK in cells, using anti–phospho-Ser209CDCA5 antibody. We incubated HeLa cells, which were
transfected with vectors designed to express nontagged
CDCA5 and ERK2-Myc/His, with each peptide for 48 hours.
Then, we stimulated the cells with EGF for 20 minutes. The
phosphorylation level of Ser209-CDCA5 was significantly suppressed by the treatment with p209-C peptide compared
with two other peptides (Fig. 6A). We also performed immunoprecepitation using Myc-agarose to precipitate ERK2 protein and found that the amount of CDCA5 protein binding to
ERK was significantly decreased in cells treated with p209-C
peptide (data not shown). Treatment of A549 and LC319 cells

that strongly expressed CDCA5 with the p209-C peptide
resulted in significant decreases in cell viability, as measured
by the MTT assay (Fig. 6B and C). Peptide p209-C revealed no
significant effect on cell viability of human lung fibroblast–
derived CCD19-Lu in which CDCA5 expression was hardly
detectable (Fig. 6D). The data indicate that the p209-C peptide could specifically inhibit the ERK kinase activity for
CDCA5 phosphorylation through the interference of their interaction, and have no or minimal toxic effect in normal human cells in which CDCA5 expression was hardly detectable.

Discussion
Despite the improvement of surgical techniques and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, lung cancer still has very poor
prognosis among malignant tumors. Therefore, it is urgently required to develop novel diagnostic biomarkers for early detection of cancer and for a better choice of adjuvant
treatment modalities to individual patients, as well as for
developing new types of anticancer drugs and/or cancer

vaccines. To identify appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic target molecules, we combined genome-wide gene expression analysis (5–9) for selecting genes that were
overexpressed in lung cancer cells with high-throughput
screening of loss-of-function effects by means of the RNAi
technique and tumor tissue microarray analysis (10–36).
Using this systematic approach, we found CDCA5 to be frequently upregulated in clinical lung cancer samples and
showed that this gene product plays an indispensable role
in growth of lung cancer cells.
Although CDCA5 was suggested to play some roles in cell
cycle progression through its interaction with cohesion on
chromatin in some immortalized cell lines (38), no study has
shown that CDCA5 could be involved in carcinogenesis. Our
study has indicated that CDCA5 is a putative oncogene that
is highly and frequently expressed in lung cancers. We found
by tissue microarray analysis that patients with NSCLC having
positive CDCA5 expression represented a shorter tumorspecific survival period, indicating that CDCA5 is likely to contribute to a malignant potential of lung cancers. In addition,

we showed that CDCA5 was phosphorylated by ERK at two
phosphorylation sites, Ser79 and Ser209, whose sequences
matched to a consensus ERK phosphorylation site and are
highly conserved in many species (data not shown). Furthermore, phosphorylation of Ser209 by ERK seemed to be critically
important for cancer cell growth.
ERK is a member of the MAPK family that functions at an
integration point for multiple biochemical signals and is
involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation, and development (45–47). Dysfunction of MAPK cascades is well
known to play a pivotal role in carcinogenesis (48). The
Raf-MEK-ERK pathway is a key downstream effector in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling (45–47).
Thus, the EGFR-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling network has
been the subject of intense research scrutiny, leading to
the discovery of new anticancer drugs. Currently, inhibitors
of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade, such as the geldanamycin analogue 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, are under
evaluation in clinical trials (49). In addition, multiple
small-molecule inhibitors for MEK and Ras have been developed (50). Although these drugs are indicated to be effective
in preclinical studies and/or in certain proportions of cancer
patients, clinical response was not likely to be precisely correlated with the activation levels of the target protein(s).
More importantly, severe adverse reactions due to their nonspecific cytotoxicity have been reported in some cases.
Therefore, development of drugs that more selectively target
this pathway based on the precise information for downstream oncogenic signals may be one of the alternative
promising approaches.
We here showed that exogenous expression of phosphomimicking CDCA5 protein whose Ser209 residue was replaced
with glutamine acid further enhanced the growth of cancer
cells, and that functional inhibition of interaction between

CDCA5 and ERK kinase by a cell-permeable peptide corresponding to a 20-amino-acid sequence part of CDCA5,
which included the Ser209 phosphorylation site by ERK, significantly reduced phosphorylation of CDCA5 and resulted in
growth suppression of lung cancer cells. Because phosphorylation of CDCA5 at the site was likely to be indispensable for
growth and survival of lung cancer cells, selective targeting of
CDCA5-ERK enzymatic activity as well as interaction between
CDCA5 and its unknown oncogenic binding partners could be
a promising therapeutic strategy that is expected to have a
strong biological activity against cancer, with a minimal risk
of adverse reactions. Further analyses of the mechanism of
growth suppression by specific inhibition of CDCA5 phosphorylation by ERK and the detailed function of downstream
effectors of CDCA5 may have the great benefit toward the development of new types of anticancer agents.
In summary, CDCA5 is likely to play a significant role in
lung carcinogenesis through its phosphorylation at Ser209
through the activation of the MAPK pathway. Inhibition of
CDCA5 itself as well as its functional interaction with ERK
kinase could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the development of new types of anticancer drugs.
