ABSTRACT
Oncogenic mutations in the Neuroblastoma Rat Sarcoma oncogene (NRAS) are
frequent in melanoma, but are also found in several other cancer types, such as lung
cancer, neuroblastoma and colon cancer. We designed our study to analyze changes in
NRAS mutant tumor cells derived from malignancies other than melanoma. A variety
of small molecule inhibitors as well as their combinations was tested in order to find
beneficial inhibitory modalities in NRASQ61 mutant lung cancer and neuroblastoma cell
lines. Signaling changes after incubation with inhibitors were studied and compared
to those found in NRAS mutant melanoma.
All cell lines were most sensitive to inhibition in the MAPK pathway with the MEK
inhibitor trametinib. MEK/AKT and MEK/CDK4,6 inhibitor combinations did not show
any beneficial effects in vitro. However, we observed strong synergism combining
MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in all cell lines. Our study provides evidence that
NRAS mutant cancers share signaling similarities across different malignancies. We
demonstrate that dual pathway inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
synergistically reduces cell viability in NRAS mutant cancers regardless of their
tissue origin. Our results suggest that such inhibitor combinations may be a potential
treatment option for non-melanoma tumors harboring activating NRAS mutations.

INTRODUCTION

found in approximately one-third of all human cancers
[1–4].
Mutations in v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene
homolog B1 (BRAF), NRAS and Kit are among the most
prevalent driving aberrations in cutaneous melanoma
with 15-20% affecting the NRAS oncogene [5,6].
While targeting of mutant BRAF with small molecule
inhibitors such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib showed
promising results in BRAF mutant melanoma, there are
no therapeutics available which specifically inhibit mutant
NRAS. Meanwhile current treatment approaches focus on
inhibiting proteins of the NRAS downstream signaling
pathways [7]. Trials are testing different drugs and
their combinations in NRAS mutant melanoma patients
(NCT01781572; NCT01941927).

Rat sarcoma (RAS) genes encode a family of small
guanosine triphosphate(GTP)ases: Harvey rat sarcoma
viral oncogene homolog (HRAS), Kirsten rat sarcoma
viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and neuroblastoma
viral oncogene homolog (NRAS). Under physiological
conditions, these proteins are activated by extracellular
stimuli and regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation
and survival [1–3]. Mutations are predominantly
found in codons 12, 13 and 61. They lead to amino
acid substitutions in corresponding proteins causing a
continuous activation of downstream pathways that leads
to cell division, cell growth and suppression of apoptosis
(reviewed in ref. [3,4]). Such mutant RAS oncogenes are

RESULTS

NRAS mutations are frequent in melanoma,
however many other cancer types also harbor mutant,
constitutively active NRAS. Table 1 reports on tumor
types in which NRAS mutations have been described and
summarizes tumor incidence, mortality, survival and the
estimated percentage of tumors bearing NRAS mutations
[5,6,8–18].
Our group has recently reported in vitro and in
vivo studies testing a variety of small molecule inhibitors
and their combinations in NRAS mutant melanoma cell
lines [19]. As shown in Table 1, NRAS mutations in nonmelanoma tumors have an important clinical impact on the
overall population. Our current study aimed to elucidate
the effects of different targeted inhibitors and their
combinations in non-melanoma NRAS mutant tumor cells.
In order to do so we chose established lung carcinoma and
neuroblastoma cell lines with known NRASQ61 mutations.
This study provides evidence that NRAS mutant cancer
shares signaling similarities across different malignancies,
thus opening up potential treatment options comparable to
those proven to be effective in NRAS mutant melanoma
tumors. Supplementary Figure S1 shows a simplified
schematic of NRAS signaling pathways and the inhibitors
used in this study.

DNA extraction and the subsequent PCR confirmed
the NRAS exon 3 Q61 mutations in cell lines SW 1271,
NCI-H2347, SK-N-AS and CHP-212. The SK-N-DZ
and NCI-H82 cell lines, used as negative controls, did
not show mutations in the NRAS gene (NRASWT). Next
we used a commercially available and validated pool of
4 different siRNAs directed against NRAS to perform
RNAi-mediated knockdown experiments [20]. As
anticipated, the NRASQ61 mutated lung carcinoma cell
lines NCI-H2347 and SW 1271, and the neuroblastoma
cell lines SK-N-AS and CHP-212 showed a significant
decrease in cell viability after siRNA mediated NRAS
knockdown, compared to cells transfected with nontargeting control siRNA and compared to NRASWT cells
(Figure 1A). The knockdown efficiency of the siRNA
pool used was measured and analyzed with the image
processing ImageJ software (Figure 1B). Neuroblastoma
cells tended to be more sensitive to NRAS knockdown

lines proved to be dependent on NRAS signaling for cell
homeostasis.

BRAFV600 mutant melanoma cell lines, serving as positive
controls to test drug efficiency of the BRAFi and AKTi,
showed a marked cell viability decrease after treatment
with the same inhibitors (Supplementary Figure S2). In
contrast, all NRASQ61 mutated cell lines were sensitive to
the MEK inhibitor (MEKi) trametinib at low nanomolar
concentrations, highlighting the importance of MEK
signaling in RAS mutant cancer. The NRASWT cell lines,
which served as negative controls, did not show cell
viability decrease following trametinib (Supplementary
Figure S3). We also found a decrease in cell viability using
the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 (PI3Ki), the mTOR1/2
inhibitor AZD8055 (mTOR1/2i), the PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors GSK2126458 and BEZ235 (PI3K/mTORi)
(Figure 2). Only the neuroblastoma cell line CHP-212
showed a relevant reduction in cell viability in response to
treatment with the CDK4,6i palbociclib.

NRASQ61 mutant lung cancer and neuroblastoma
cell lines are most sensitive to inhibition of the
MAPK pathway
In order to evaluate the response of NRASQ61
mutated lung carcinoma and neuroblastoma cell lines to
different small molecule inhibitors, we incubated cells
with different inhibitors of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/
mTOR cascade as well as with the CDK4,6 inhibitor
palbociclib (CDK4,6i). As expected, all cell lines
showed no sensitivity to the specific BRAFV600 inhibitor
(BRAFi) vemurafenib and to the AKT inhibitor (AKTi)
GSK690693 at concentrations used in this study. Two

The combination of MEK and PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor synergistically decreases cell viability in
NRASQ61 mutant lung cancer and neuroblastoma
cell lines in vitro
To test effectiveness of potential combination
therapies, we combined the MEKi trametinib with one of
the following: AKTi GSK690693, CDK4,6i palbociclib
or PI3K/mTORi GSK2126458. Using the Chou-Talalay
method to calculate synergism of drug combinations,
we observed no beneficial effects when combining
MEKi with CDK4,6i or AKTi in vitro. In contrast, we
observed a strong synergism combining MEKi and PI3K/
mTORi in all NRASQ61 mutated cell lines (Figure 3B).
The NRASWT negative controls showed a decrease in cell
viability following treatment with GSK2126458, but no
synergism could be seen when the drug was combined
with trametinib (Supplementary Figure S3B)
In this study, we used Cell Titer Glo Assay as a
measure of cell viability. However, because Cell Titer Glo
Assay functions by detecting metabolically active cells it
may have missed live cells with low metabolic activity.
We decided to further confirm the induction of apoptosis
by combining Annexin V/Propridium Iodide assay with
flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S4). Table 2
reports the GI50 and CI values for all cell lines tested.
We now asked the question if the expected signaling
changes after inhibitor treatment are comparable to those
observed in melanoma cells. Immunoblot analyses for
the effector proteins of the targeted pathways showed
that only the combination of MEKi and a PI3K/mTORi
sufficiently suppressed protein levels of p-ERK, p-AKT
and p-S6 in all cell lines, including the NRASWT negative
controls (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S3A).
Incubation with the AKTi led to the previously described
“paradoxical” AKT hyperphosphorylation in all cell
lines tested. This is thought to be due to the occupation

and SK-N-DZ. Neuroblastoma cell lines are more sensitive

inhibitors [21–23].

signaling behavior, which allows the conclusion that
MEKi and PI3K/mTORi might also be effective in other
malignancies which bear NRAS mutations, including
neuroblastoma and lung cancer.
Recent studies have shown that a dual inhibition
of MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways leads to a
reduction of cell viability in vitro and a decrease in tumor
size in xenograft models of NRAS mutant melanoma
[19,24]. In this study we sought to investigate NRAS
mutant lung cancer and neuroblastoma cell lines and
showed that certain small molecule inhibitor combinations
could also be used in NRAS mutant cancers other than
melanoma. While MEKi/AKTi and MEKi/CDK4,6i
combinations did not reveal beneficial effects in vitro,
we were able to prove that MEKi and PI3K/mTORi
synergistically reduce cell viability in all cells tested.
Among the different tumors which are known to

DISCUSSION
Oncogenic mutations of the NRAS gene in codons
12, 13 and 61 lead to increased downstream signaling
through the well-known NRAS mutant melanoma
signaling cascades MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR [24,25].
Whereas, several studies explore the potential use of
inhibitors in these pathways in NRAS mutant melanoma,
only one study investigated the effects of such therapeutics
on NRAS mutated lung cancer cell lines and one study
reported on the use of CDK4,6 inhibitors in neuroblastoma
cell lines [10,19,24,26–28]. Our study provides evidence
that NRAS mutant cancers share similarities in their

increasing concentrations of different small molecule inhibitors (n>3, 72hrs incubation). Curves represent the relative
change in viability compared to vehicle treated controls. Nanomolar concentrations of the MEK inhibitor trametinib (Upper panel) are
sufficient to reduce cell viability, whereas inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade (PP242, GDC-0941, GSK690693, GSK2126458,
AZD8055, BEZ235) and the CDK4,6 inhibitor palbociclib required higher amounts of drug (Middle and Lower panel). All cell lines were
resistant to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and the AKT inhibitor GSK690693. Only the neuroblastoma cell line CHP212 was sensitive
to CDK4,6 inhibition with palbociclib.

of achieving growth inhibition in several tumor types in
vitro and in vivo (19,26,32)]. Current clinical trials are
testing different inhibitor combinations in solid tumors
such as melanoma and lung cancer using therapeutics in
these cascades. Whereas MAPK inhibition is believed to
be a corner stone of RAS treatment, the rationale behind
using these combination regimens is to achieve greater
anti-tumoral activity using possible synergisms between
different drugs and preventing the development of
resistance.
We were able to demonstrate that the combination
of a MEKi and a PI3K/mTORi can reduce cell viability in
NRAS mutant cancer cell lines other than melanoma. The
calculated combination index showed a clear synergistic
effect for MEKi and PI3K/mTORi combinations, while
it failed to show synergism when combing MEKi with
AKTi or CDK4,6i in vitro. The inhibition of the MAPK
and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was needed to abolish
p-ERK and p-S6, two downstream effectors of the NRAS
cascade. Even though the addition of AKTi and CDK4,6i
was not promising in our study, it is important to mention
that other inhibitor combinations, interfering with the
above mentioned pathways, might also be effective. We
are aware of the fact that a translation of in vitro findings
into in vivo applications bears considerable challenges, as
currently available PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are known to
have unfavorable side effect profiles. Also, inhibitors that
are ineffective in vitro might still be beneficial in vivo.
However, this study adds evidence to the importance of
the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathway in NRAS mutant
cancer and supports that these findings are not limited
to NRAS mutant melanoma cells. We also highlight that
the rationale for dual pathway inhibition appears to be
imperative, as several pathways are activated by mutant
NRAS and cross talk between the two pathways exists
[26,33,34].
In conclusion, we show that mutant NRAS
signaling shares similarities across various malignancies
and that NRAS mutant tumors from different tissues can
be blocked with same combinations. With the advent of
screening for oncogenic mutations in clinical practice,
the consideration of different treatment options based on
individual mutations has become increasingly important.
Our results suggest that inhibitor combinations targeting
the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways downstream
of NRAS may be a potential treatment option for nonmelanoma tumors harboring activating NRAS mutations.

harbor NRAS mutations (Table 1), we decided to focus our
experiments on lung cancer and neuroblastoma cell lines,
due to the lack of studies in this specific subset of cells.
A study recently reported on the clinical characteristics
of NRAS mutant lung cancer, which accounts for
approximately 1% of non-small cell lung cancers. The
majority of mutations were found in codon 61 (80%). The
authors also reported on 6 NRAS mutant lung carcinoma
cell lines and their sensitivity to the MEK inhibitors
selumetinib and trametinib and their resistance to erlotinib
(EGFR-TK inhibitor), crizotinib (ALK/MET/RON/ROS1
inhibitor) and linsitinib (IGF-1R inhibitor) [10]. Even
less is known about NRAS mutations in neuroblastoma.
A study which reviewed the genetic aberrations of 240
stage IV neuroblastoma patients reported NRAS mutations
in 0.83% of the studied tumors [12]. We hypothesized
that different cancer types with activating mutations in
the same location of NRAS respond to small molecule
inhibitors and their combinations in a way comparable to
NRAS mutant melanoma cells.
To prove dependency on the mutant NRAS protein,
we transiently knocked down NRAS using a commercially
available and validated siRNA pool. The knockdown of
NRAS decreased NRAS protein expression and cell
viability for all four cell lines, thus indicating the need
of oncogenic NRAS for cell maintenance. In contrast, the
NRASWT cell lines did not show a significant decrease of
cell viability after NRAS knockdown. Other studies in
NRAS mutant lung cancer cell lines support our findings,
albeit in different cell lines. Furthermore, our results are
in line with NRAS knockdown experiments published
previously, proving that NRAS is a bona fide oncogene in
our subset of cancer cell lines [10,29].
These findings led us to the assumption that
the downstream pathways in our four non-melanoma
NRAS mutant cancer cell lines might be comparable to
signaling signatures in NRAS mutant melanoma. Thus,
we hypothesized that synthetic interference of these
pathways might have similar effects on cell viability.
The sensitivity profiles to the inhibitors of the two key
NRAS downstream signaling cascades MAPK and PI3K/
AKT/mTOR were similar to sensitivity profiles found in
NRAS mutant melanoma [19]. This indicates the potential
use of those inhibitors in NRAS mutant lung cancer and
neuroblastoma (Fig 2).
Only the neuroblastoma cell line CHP-212 showed a
relevant decrease in cell viability when incubated with the
CDK4,6i palbociclib. We interpret this finding as a result
of CHP-212 having an N-Myc amplification and higher
expression of the protein (Supplementary Figure S5). This
is in accordance with previously published studies where it
was shown that the sensitivity of neuroblastoma cell lines
to CDK4,6 inhibitors is correlated with N-Myc expression
[28,30,31].
Mounting evidence suggests that dual inhibition
of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is capable

Sanger
sequencing was carried out and the sequences were
analyzed with the Mutation Surveyor Version 4.0.9
(Softgenetics, State College, PA, USA)

Cells were plated in 12-well plates and after 24 hour
incubation treated with DMSO, trametinib, GSK2126458
or their combinations. After 72hrs apoptosis analysis
was performed using the Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit with
Annexin V Alexa Fluor 488 & Propidium Iodide according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen; V13241) with
the AccuriC6 Flow Cytometer using the CFlow software
(Version 1.0.227.4).

Immunoblots
Cells were washed with ice cold phosphate buffered
saline (PBS), lysed using radio-immunoprecipitation
(RIPA) buffer [150mM NaCl, 1% (vol/vol) Nonidet
P-40, 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (wt/
vol) SDS] in 50mM Tris HCl (pH8.0) supplemented with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce; 78442) as
described previously (36)]. Protein concentrations were
determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce, IL,
USA; 23225) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE with 4-20%
gradient gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA; 4561096), transferred to an Immobilon-P PVDF membrane
(Millipore, MA, USA; IPVH00010), and blocked in 5%
dry milk in Tris Buffered Saline, with Tween 20 (TBST)
(Sigma-Aldrich). The membrane was incubated with
primary and secondary antibodies, and target proteins
were detected with ECL detection reagent (Pierce; 32106).
β-Actin served as a loading control and was obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich. Phosphor-ERK (4370), phosphor-AKT
(4060), phosphor-S6 (4857), N-Myc (9405S) antibodies
were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (MA,
USA). N-Ras antibody (F155) was obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (CA, USA). The NRAS protein
knockdown efficiencies were analysed using the software
ImageJ (version 1.49d).

siRNA Experiments
For siRNA studies, cell lines were plated in 96
well plates with a density of 4000-8000 cells per well,
or 6 well plates with a density of 100000-200000 cells
per well. After 24 hours, cells were transfected with the
pre-designed ON-TARGET plus Human NRAS siRNA
SMARTpool or the ON-TARGET plus Non-targeting
Control siRNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA)
at a final concentration of 25nM, using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, CA, USA) as per manufacturer’s
instructions and incubated for 72h post transfection. All
siRNA experiments were performed at least in triplicates.

Cell Viability Assays
All drugs used in the study were purchased from
Selleck Chemicals and ChemieTek and were dissolved
