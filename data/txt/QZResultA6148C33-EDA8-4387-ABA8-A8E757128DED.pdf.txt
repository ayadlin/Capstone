ABSTRACT
Wnt/β-catenin signaling is responsible for the generation of cancer stem cells
(CSCs) in many human tumors, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Recent
studies demonstrate that Wnt or PORCN inhibitor, Wnt-C59, inhibits tumor growth
in MMTV-WNT1 transgenic mice. The effect of Wnt-C59 in human tumors is not clear.
In this study, the NPC cell lines investigated manifest heterogeneous responses
to Wnt-C59 treatment. Wnt-C59 decreased tumor growth of SUNE1 cells in mice
immediately following the administration of Wnt-C59. Mice injected with HNE1 cells
did not develop visible tumors after the treatment of Wnt-C59, while control mice
developed 100% tumors. Wnt-C59 inhibited stemness properties of NPC cells in a
dosage-dependent manner by arresting sphere formation in both HNE1 and SUNE1
cells. Thus, Wnt-C59 has the potential to eradicate CSCs in human tumors. Active
β-catenin and Axin2 proteins were strongly expressed in stromal cells surrounding
growing tumors, confirming the importance of Wnt signaling activities in the
microenvironment being driving forces for cell growth. These novel findings confirm
the ability of Wnt-C59 to suppress Wnt-driven undifferentiated cell growth in NPC.
Both anti-Wnt signaling and anti-CSC approaches are feasible strategies in cancer
therapy.

INTRODUCTION

tumors [11-13]. Dosage levels of Wnt signaling and genetic
background of tissues play critical roles in regulating
self-renewal tumor cell networks [3, 14, 15]. Lack of
knowledge underlying signal transduction mechanisms
clearly impedes the exploration of effective therapeutic
targets for this pathway [9, 10, 16]. A few promising Wnt
targeting molecules, such as ICG001 [17], XAV939 [18],
and Wnt-C59 [19], have been recently reported. Porcupine
(PORCN) is a membrane bound O-acyltransferase
(MBOAT) family that is essential for Wnt palmitoylation,
secretion, and other biological activities, indicating that
PORCN activity is a key modulator of Wnt signaling [16,
20]. Wnt-C59 is a strong and specific PORCN inhibitor.
This small molecule is similar to other Wnt inhibitors,
IWP family and LGK974, that inactivate PORCN function
by directly inhibiting the PORCN active site or affecting

The central concept of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is
that the bulk of tumor cells contain a tiny cell population
having self-renewal ability to sustain the long-term tumor
proliferation against chemotherapy. Efforts to control the
growth of these unique tumor cells are a major effort in
current translational and clinical cancer research [1, 2].
A growing number of studies indicate that inappropriate
activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling correlates with the
generation of CSCs in many tumor types [3-8]. Therefore,
targeting of this pathway may provide the means to safely
eradicate CSCs and identify novel molecular targets for
cancer therapy [9, 10].

regulators such as Axin2 [7, 16, 20, 21]. A model of finetuning of the Wnt pathway by Wnt-C59 was proposed
in which either β-catenin-mediated or its downstream
components-mediated activities are arrested by PORCN
inhibitors [22]. Several recent studies provide evidence
showing that PORCN inhibitors, including Wnt-C59 and
LGK974, inhibit or delay tumor growth in mouse models.
These experiments were performed in MMTV-WNT1
transgenic mice and findings indicate that mammalian
physiological Wnt signaling is sensitive to PORCN
expression levels. Small changes in PORCN activity
can induce significant inhibitory effects in rodent tumor
models. Notably, Wnt-C59 and LGK974 are safe agents
as verified in these animal studies and the latter is now in
the phase I clinical trials [20, 23].
Recent findings reveal the vital role of Wnt signaling
in both epithelial and stromal cells; inhibitory effects of
Wnt-C59 mimick the PORCN knockout mouse to block
proliferation of intestinal stem cells at physiological
conditions [24]. However, whether targeting the Wnt
pathway can be achieved to eradicate human CSCs by
affecting the tumor microenvironment is largely unknown.
Using reduced expression of Axin2 mRNA as a reporter,
Liu et al screened many human tumor cells, including
brain, lung, and colon cancers and lymphoma/leukemia,
and only detected a few (31%, 31/96 cases) head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines that were
sensitive to the PORCN inhibitor treatment. One of these
HNSCC cell lines, HN30, delays tumor growth within
a 15-day period in vivo, following the administration
of LGK974 [20]. Only a fraction of human tumors are
sensitive to PORCN inhibitors, although aberrant Wnt
signaling is widely reported in many human tumors [25].
We already know that precise regulation of PORCN
activity is required for physiologically relevant expression
levels of Wnt signaling, which might fine-tune network
activities over a large dynamic range [19]. Therefore,
many human tumor cells may not have responded to
PORCN treatment because of the inappropriate or
overexpressed levels of Wnt pathway activities or the
involvement of other interacting pathways induced by
aberrant Wnt signalling and accumulated mutations in
these cells. However, such tumor models with dominant
activation of Wnt signalling are limited for current studies.
Our early studies show that self-renewal networks
in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) stem-like cells are
precisely regulated by dominant physiological levels
of Wnt/β-catenin signaling [3]. The exogenous Wnt
signaling in these cells, interacting with p53, RB1, TGF-β,
epithelial-mesenchymal transition and other pathways, can
induce extensive signaling cascades and regulate LIFRand IL6ST-mediated cell self-renewal networks. More
importantly, inhibition of Wnt signaling in these stem-like
cells could effectively suppress cell growth and sphere
formation. Given the key roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
in NPC [26], it is an attractive therapeutic approach to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

test PORCN inhibitor in this unique human cancer. Using
several NPC cell lines, we now demonstrate that a PORCN
inhibitor is able to inhibit Wnt signaling activities, arrest
stemness properties, and suppress tumor cell growth in
animal assays. Although these results vary depending on
the context of NPC cells, these novel findings demonstrate
that inhibition of Wnt signaling is a promising therapeutic
approach in certain human tumors.

RESULTS
Wnt-C59-sensitive cell lines in mice have stemness
properties in cell culture
To determine whether NPC cells are sensitive
to Wnt-C59 treatment, as reported in other head and
neck tumors, we established a 3-dimensional (3D) cell
culture system [27]. Plating cell densities influenced
3D sphere-formation abilities because most cells grew
as a monolayer and only a small population of cells
was capable of sphere formation. Cells growing as a
monolayer surrounding the spheres might change to 3D
growth, reflecting a NPC stemness property influenced
by the local microenvironment. After 30 days culture,
experiments were terminated and examined for sphere
formation. C666-1 cells grow quickly, but most cells form
a colony-like morphology and do not show obvious 3D
cell growth. The sphere-formation ability was weak for
both CNE1 and HK1 cells compared to HNE1 and SUNE1
cells that exhibited fast cell growth abilities and formed
relatively large spheres (Figures 1A and 1B).
Previous studies indicated that Wnt-C59 did not
significantly inhibit in vitro proliferation in 46 cancer cell
lines at concentrations that might inhibit PORCN. The
IC50 was greater than 50 µM in 87% of tested cell lines
[23]. To investigate anti-stemness activities induced by
Wnt-C59 in NPC cells, we investigated possible growth
influences of this small molecule in a NPC cell line
panel. As shown in Figure 1C, SUNE1 cells exhibited a
strong tolerance to this agent, as reported in many other
human cancer cell lines. Both CNE1 and HNE1 cells
showed reduced growth abilities in the higher Wnt-C59
concentration (20 µM), while HK1 cells were sensitive to
all concentrations (5 µM, 10 µM, and 20 µM) of Wnt-C59
treatments.
Both SUNE1 and HNE1 cells showed a greater
ability to form spheres (Figures 1A and 1B). Their IC50
for Wnt-C59 treatment at 48 hours is greater than 60 µM.
Additionally, these two cell lines have obviously different
in vivo cell growth dynamics, providing good animal
models to determine biological effects of Wnt-C59 in NPC
cells. HNE1 cells display less aggressive tumor growth
in mice. While the majority of injected HNE1 cells (1 x
107) die and injected cell nodules shrink for about 2 or 3

weeks post-injection, a fraction of the population survived
and subsequently expanded to form progressively growing
tumors after a period of latency, as seen in the control
group mice (Figure 2A and 2B). In the 41-day testing
period, the first and last growing tumors of the controls
appeared on days 20 and 38, respectively, reflecting highly
heterogeneous tumor behaviors. Shortly after the latency
period, visible tumors were observed in all injected sites
(7/7). In contrast, all injected tumor nodules shrank and
disappeared following the administration of Wnt-C59 in

3 weeks and no visible and progressively growing tumors
were detected in any injected sites (0/8) in 41 days, as
shown in Figures 2A and 2B. Histological examination
confirmed that all growing nodules in the control group
contained tumor cells. Figure 2C shows a representative
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained section of the
smallest tumor finally appearing in mice. Therefore, the
complete suppression of HNE1 cells in vivo confirms
that the growth of the NPC subcutaneous tumor can be
inhibited by Wnt-C59.

In contrast to HNE1, SUNE1 is a fast-growing
cancer cell line. We tested tumor inhibitory effects of
Wnt-C59 in nude mice following injection of SUNE1
cells. Figure 2D shows that Wnt-C59 inhibits SUNE1 cell
growth immediately after administration of this agent for

the 13-day period of tumor growth in mice. Compared to
tumor sizes of control groups, average inhibited tumor
sizes in Wnt-C59-treated animals were significantly
smaller (p < 0.001). Comparison of tumor weights from
both control and experimental groups is shown in Figure

2E, revealing that average tumor weights of the Wnt-C59treated groups were significantly lower than for control
mice (p < 0.001).

The inhibitory effects of Wnt-C59 were dosage-dependent
in these NPC cells; both 5 µM and 20 µM Wnt-C59
treatments can arrest sphere formation in both HNE1 and
SUNE1 cell lines, but not CNE1 cells. However, cells
showing a monolayer growth with Wnt-C59 treatments
were continuously expanding and both 3D inhibition and
monolayer growth were consistent, as observed from
weeks 1 to 3 (Figure 3B).
After a three-week treatment, we withdrew
Wnt-C59 and continued to culture cells for 10 to 20 days
more under control cell culture conditions. No obvious 3D

Wnt-C59 suppresses in vivo tumor growth and
high Wnt-C59 concentrations are also effective in
in vitro assays
A low concentration (1 µM) of Wnt-C59 treatment
suppresses SUNE1 cells and 3D growth was clearly
inhibited compared to control untreated cells (Figure 3A).

growth resumed or was detected in HNE1 cells, although
cell densities and incubation periods were sufficient
to generate 3D growth for untreated cells. However,
monolayer-growing SUNE1 cells gradually formed huge
spheres in 20 days under untreated culture conditions
(Figure 3C). These findings indicated that inhibitory
effects of Wnt-C59 on stemness were irreversible as seen
in HNE1. The HNE1 cells with stemness properties in the
whole cell populations could be safely eradicated by the
Wnt inhibitor.
To verify the different effects of the Wnt inhibitors
in our established sphere-formation system, we evaluated
two other non-PORCN inhibitors, ICG001 and XAV939,
as previously described. As expected, no obvious anti-

stemness effects were observed by these two agents after
three weeks of culture of HNE1 and SUNE1 cells (Figure
3D) even at higher concentrations of agents. Compared to
control cells, no obvious growth inhibition was induced,
confirming that these two Wnt inhibitors have different
regulatory effects in the tumor cells.

Wnt-C59 inhibits the Wnt pathway in vivo
Wnt signaling in the stroma plays a vital role in the
stem cell niche, as reported recently [24]. Therefore, we
examined protein expression of active β-catenin and Axin2
in tumor tissues. These two proteins clearly accumulated

Figure 4: Wnt/β-catenin pathway is activated in the niche of growing tumors. A. IHC staining shows that strong expression

of both active β-catenin and Axin2 is detected in stromal cells around cancer nests derived from both control and Wnt-C59-treated mice
with injected SUNE1 cells. The representative images of β-catenin expression under both higher and lower power objectives are presented,
and a negative control without using primary antibodies is also included. B. Wnt signaling is up-regulated in tumor tissues obtained from
control mouse injected with HNE1 cells and IHC staining shows that extensive expression of Axin2 is detected in stromal cells around
cancer nests (top). The β-catenin is also expressed in stromal tissues of tumor (bottom). C. and D. Wnt-C59 has systemic effects in mice
injected with HNE1 cells. Both active β-catenin and Axin2 expression are down-regulated in liver and kidney in Wnt-C59-treated mice,
compared with those from control mice.

DISCUSSION

in stromal cells around cancer nests, especially in the
fast-growing region of the tumor tissues. No obvious
difference of expression of these two proteins was detected
between control and Wnt-C59-treated mice with injected
SUNE1 cells, indicating that the tumor microenvironment
in SUNE1 (Figure 4A) and HNE1 cells (Figure 4B) had
favorable and up-regulated Wnt pathway activities. The
Wnt-C59 had limited influence on these growing tumors
in treated mice with injected SUNE1 cells.
Importantly, expression of active β-catenin and
Axin2 in liver (Figure 4C) and kidney (Figure 4D) was
clearly down-regulated in the Wnt-C59-treated HNE1 cellinjected mice compared to control mice. These findings
confirmed that the administration of Wnt-C59 generated a
systemic influence on the Wnt pathway in treated animals
within a 41-day assay period, which induced tumor
suppression in tested mice.
We recently reported that NPC HONE1 cells have
very low endogenous activities of the Wnt pathway,
especially expression of β-catenin [3]. Using this line
as a control, we compared Wnt activities in HNE1 and
SUNE1 cells. Western blotting confirmed that both HNE1
and SUNE1 cells expressed β-catenin and Axin2 proteins,
which are key mediators of the Wnt pathway (Figure 5A).
Notably, the active form of β-catenin was also detected in
these two cell lines, reflecting that the activated Wnt/βcatenin signaling status in both HNE1 and SUNE1 cells,
compared to control HONE1 cells.
Expression changes of β-catenin and Axin2, derived
from Wnt-C59-treated and control spheres (DMSO) cells
(Figure 3B), is seen in Figure 5B; expression of both
genes was inhibited by Wnt-C59 (5 µM) in both HNE1
and SUNE1 cells.
To understand the influence of the Wnt pathway
in tumor microenvironments, we examined SUNE1
cell-derived mouse tumors with and without Wnt-C59
treatment. Using parental SUNE1 cells as controls, the
PCR assays showed the increased expression of β-catenin
(Figure 5C) and Wnt10B (Figure 5D) in all tumor samples,
including both control and Wnt-C59-treated mice. There is
no obvious difference in the expression of β-catenin and
Wnt10B between Wnt-C59-treated and control tumors,
suggesting that Wnt pathway activities are similar in these
tumors derived from SUNE1 cells. Because mouse tumors
contain both SUNE1 and stromal cells, we compared
β-catenin and Wnt10B expression to that of parental
SUNE1 cells that had no stromal influences. As expected,
mouse tumor tissues had higher Wnt activities compared
to the in vitro cultured SUNE1 cell line. Additionally,
Wnt10B expression, reported to be associated with
Wnt-C59 treatment [7], increased with expression of
β-catenin as expected. These results confirm the IHC
staining findings detected in tumor tissues (Figures 4A
and 4B), indicating that Wnt pathway activities, especially
in the tumor microenvironment, stimulated SUNE1 cell
tumor growth.

A successful anticancer therapy should eliminate
both the differentiated cancer cells and undifferentiated
CSC populations. Although the CSC concept has been
linked to resistance in cancer therapy for some tumor
models, definitive evidence for functional suppression
of tumor growth by manipulating both Wnt signaling
and CSC activities is lacking. CSCs have the capacity
to self-renew and this property is controlled by several
developmental pathways, including Wnt signaling [3, 13,
28]. Although there is lack of direct evidence showing
the existence of CSCs in unmanipulated solid tumors
[2], many studies revealed the CSCs may be present in
tumors as a distinct small population driving relapse and
metastasis by giving rise to new chemoresistant tumors
[1]. A hypothetical issue is whether Wnt inhibitors can
inhibit CSC activities, since tumor stemness properties
have long been suggested to correlate with both Wnt
activation and tumor proliferation [1, 10, 29]. Therefore,
it is of interest to understand whether both cancer stemness
and proliferation activities can be altered by regulating the
Wnt signaling cascade in tumor cells.
We focused on Wnt-mediated self-renewal signaling
networks in NPC cells and detected that NPC stemness
was precisely regulated by the physiological levels of
Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We reported that multiple tumor
suppressor pathways, including p53 and RB1, within NPC
cells are important for maintaining a balanced environment
for upregulation of β-catenin expression [3, 30].
Additionally, we recently found that BLU, one of the TSGs
mapped to the chromosome 3p21.3 region, controlled the
NPC microenvironment and angiogenesis [31]. Since
β-catenin is extensively activated in NPC tissues [32]
and cell lines (seen in this study) and CSC properties
are strongly regulated by microenvironment [4], it is
possible that these TSGs play critical roles in both Wntor stemness-mediated activities in NPC. Given the facts
that inflammation and Epstein-Barr Virus infection are
very common in NPC cells [33], these microenvironment
changes may also influence Wnt signaling and expression
of TSGs through epigenetic regulation. Further elucidation
of these interacting mechanisms underlying the Wnt
pathway in NPC may provide useful insight for the
development of an effective therapeutic approach.
One major stemness property in tumors is 3D
sphere growth, which is widely used to explore dynamics,
function, and regulation of stem cells for clonogenic
growth potential [34]. To demonstrate the ability of Wnt
inhibitors to suppress tumor stemness, we performed
sphere inhibition assays in various NPC cells. In the
ordinary culture conditions, these NPC cells usually grow
as monolayers and do not form spheres. We now provide
evidence confirming that cellular ability for 3D growth of
some NPC cells is strongly correlated with the activation
of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling and can be suppressed by

the Wnt inhibitor, Wnt-C59.
NPC, like other human tumors, harbors genetically
distinct subclones, which influence cellular heterogeneity
in tumor behaviors. Recent study demonstrated that
the Wnt pathway was responsible for this hierarchical
configuration in tumor cells [35]. Like another Wnt
inhibitor, ICG001, inhibitory effects of Wnt-C59 on cell
proliferation and sphere formation were context-dependent
in breast cancer [7]. However, the PORCN inhibitory
approach is only suitable for a limited number of tumor
cell lines having aberrant Wnt activation, as described
previously. Our current investigations demonstrate
that the great diversity of cells impacts tumor behavior
and is an important and unavoidable issue faced when
molecular therapy approaches are explored, as seen in
CNE1, SUNE1, HNE1, and other HNSCC cells [36].
The Wnt pathway activities differ in these cells and
influence responses to Wnt-C59 treatment. Consequently,
the CNE1 stemness activity was not obviously inhibited
by the PORCN inhibitor, reflecting heterogeneity of
NPC cells and suggesting that other pathways, such as
EGFR and AKT, possibly contribute to CNE1 stemness
[37]. Although the Wnt pathway strongly correlates
with stemness properties in some NPC cells, two Wnt
inhibitors, ICG001 and XAV939, did not show obvious
inhibitory effects on stemness in treated cells. These
results suggest differences in regulatory networks are
controlled by the complicated Wnt signaling in human
tumor cells [8, 9].
We chose both SUNE1 and HNE1 cell lines
with distinct growth dynamics for animal studies. The
hypothesis is if Wnt signaling was dominant in the control
of cellular stemness and proliferation, it would be possible
to demonstrate the inhibitory effects by Wnt-C59 in these
cell lines. Wnt-C59 treatment obviously delayed the
growth of SUNE1 cells immediately after administration
of tested chemicals in animals, but expression of active
β-catenin protein was detected in tumor stroma. The
findings suggested that Wnt-C59 was not able to fully
control the CSC microenvironment to favor SUNE1induced tumor growth in animals. It was also possible that
some unknown negative feedback or redundant regulatory
mechanisms finally dominated the signaling networks
that caused restoration of Wnt activities and tumor cell
proliferation in SUNE1 cells.
To detect long-term effects of Wnt-C59 in animals,
which have not been reported yet, we investigated tumor
growth of HNE1 cells. These cells require a longer
latency period to form growing tumors in mice, reflecting
greater intra-tumoral heterogeneity in this cell line. In the
control group, surviving tumor cells, presumably CSCs,
expanded in the injection sites and formed progressively
growing tumors very quickly after the latency period. In
contrast, injected tumor cells died and did not form visible
and progressively growing tumors after the treatment
of Wnt-C59 in animals. It was not possible to directly
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

show the presence of CSCs in injected HNE1 cells, but
the sphere inhibition assay demonstrates that Wnt-C59
could safely eliminate cells with stemness properties in
an irreversible manner. Both in vitro and in vivo assays
further confirm these findings and support the notion for
the presence of CSCs in this cell line.
Targeting CSCs to suppress tumor growth is a major
focus in current cancer research [38]. The current findings
demonstrate that Wnt-C59 can effectively suppress Wnt
signaling and stemness properties of certain tumor cells.
We provide functional evidence demonstrating the use of
an anti-CSC agent for tumor growth control is a feasible
approach in cancer therapy and may be broadly exploited
in human tumors.

NPC CNE1, HK1, HNE1, HONE1, and SUNE1
cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified eagle
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS. All
these cell lines were obtained from the Hong Kong NPC
AoE Cell Line Repository (Center for NPC Research at
University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong) and have been
authenticated by genotyping analysis. C666-1 cells were
cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum. Cells for sphere and sphere inhibition assays were
cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium (Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10 ng/ml
epidermal growth factor (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA), 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (R&D
Systems), and B-27 Supplement (Life Technologies).
All tested cells for stemness were maintained in Nunc
HydroCell 24 multidish (Themo Fisher Scientific,
Roskilde, Denmark).

Wnt inhibitors
Wnt-C59 was obtained from Cellagen Technology
(San Diego, CA, USA) and was dissolved in DMSO
making a 10 mM stock solution following the
manufacturer’s manual. Concentrations of 1 µM, 5 µM,
10 µM and 20 µM were used as working solutions in in
vitro assays. ICG001 and XAV939 were obtained from
R&D Systems and Cellagen Technology, respectively,
and 10 mM stock solutions were prepared in DMSO. The
concentrations of 5 µM and 10 µM of these two agents

Wnt10B: TGGGATGTGTAGCCTTCTCC (forward) and
CCCAGCCAAAAGGAGTATGA (reverse). For qPCR
analysis, triplicate PCR reactions were performed using
the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR Instrument (Roche
Diagnositics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).

Approximately, 1 x 104 cells were seeded in
24-well plates, and Wnt-C59 (5 µM, 10 µM, and 20
µM) was added the next day. Each group was tested in
triplicate and control groups with addition of DMSO
were also established. Cell confluence was determined
by microscopy at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after seeding
of cells. The IC50 of Wnt-C59 was determined by MTT
(3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide) assay, using 96-well dishes. Next day, various
concentrations of Wnt-C59 were added, and cellular
viabilities were measured by a spectrophotometer at both
24 and 48 hours.
For sphere formation, approximately one hundred
cells were seeded onto the Low Cell Bind Surface 24well Nunc dish. Each group was done in triplicate and
each well had 2 ml medium. Media were changed twice
a week, and only half of the media was changed each
time. Approximately, 1 x 103 cells were seeded for each
well in the sphere inhibition assay. At 1 to 5 days after
plating, all tested cells formed small spheres. Five days
later, Wnt-C59 (1 µM, 5 µM, and 20 µM) was added into
experimental groups. Abilities for cell growth and sphere
images were compared and recorded at the end of the
first, second, and third weeks after addition of Wnt-C59,
or DMSO in control groups. The sphere growths were
observed and recorded daily under microscopy, and the
area of spheres was analyzed using Metamorph (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and recorded as average
area (µm2).

Animal assay
The in vivo animal assays were performed as
previously reported [39, 40]. A total of 1 x 107 cells in
200 μl DMEM were injected into 4-8 week old nude mice
subcutaneously. Next day, mice were randomly divided
into two groups, experimental and control, and were
given Wnt-C59 via vein injection. Based on previous
reports [22-24], Wnt-C59 was dissolved in 30% propylene
glycol for intravenous tail vein administration (2.5 mg/
kg). After 48 hours, Wnt-C59 was added into drinking
water (5 mg/kg/day) for experimental groups. Fresh
water with Wnt-C59 was changed every 48 hours in dark
bottles avoiding light; water consumption was recorded
and calculated. Mice in control groups were treated with
injection of 30% propylene glycol and given fresh water
containing DMSO. Tumor sizes were measured three
times a week until the last day of the experiment. Injected
tumor cell nodule growth or shrinkage was recorded and
only progressively growing tumors, confirmed by both
gross and histology examinations, were counted. Tumor
incidence was determined based on tumor numbers on the
last day of experiment and termination day of assay was
decided depending on possible appearance of ulcers on
the surface of fast-growing tumors in control animals. All
animal experiments were approved by the Government
of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the
University of Hong Kong.

Western blotting
Western blotting was performed as previously
described (3). The antibodies used in this assay are
β-catenin (catalog # 9587, Cell Signaling,), Anti-Active
β-catenin (catalog # 05-665, Millipore), and Axin2
(catalog # 2151, Cell Signaling). The α-tubulin (catalog #
CP06, Calbiochem) was used as a loading control for all
experiments.

Histology and immunohistochemical staining
Mouse organs and tumor tissues were excised from
mice, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and stained
with H&E and IHC, as previously described (31). Primary
antibodies of anti-Active β-catenin and Axin2 (Catalog #
MABN259, Millipore) were used. The counterstain with
hematoxylin was performed before mounting. The slides
were scanned by ImageScope v11 software (Aperio, Vista,
CA, USA).

qPCR analyses
RNAs from tumor samples were extracted using the
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Human
GAPDH, primers GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC
(forward)
and
GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC
(reverse), was used as an internal control for all
PCR reactions. The primers for qPCR are β-catenin:
GGCTTGGAATGAGACTGCTGAT (forward) and
CTGGCCATATCCACCAGAGTG (reverse); Axin2:
CGCAGCAGTTTGGCGGCAGCA (forward) and
AGGGTCCTGGGTGAACAGGTGGG (reverse); and

Statistical analysis
Differences between two groups were scored for
statistical significances, using Student’s t-test or Chisquare test.
