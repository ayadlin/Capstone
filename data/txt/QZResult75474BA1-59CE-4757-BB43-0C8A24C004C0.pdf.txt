ABSTRACT
Protease nexin 1 (PN1) is an endogenous serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN),
expressed at high levels in the prostate, and capable of inhibiting the proliferation
of prostate cancer cells. We previously showed that PN1-uPA complexes inhibited
Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signalling through engagement of the LRP receptor. Here, we
describe an alternative anti-proliferative mechanism through which PN1 expression
leads to apoptosis. In prostate cancer cells, increased expression of PN1 led to
substantial reduction of XIAP levels and apoptosis mediated through the uPAR,
but not the LRP receptor. The alterations in XIAP were effected in two ways 1) via
alteration in the NF-κB pathway, a pathway known to signal XIAP transcription and 2)
by promoting XIAP instability. The AKT pathway is known to phosphorylate XIAP at
serine 87 leading to protein stability and PN1 expression is shown to interfere with
this process. As a result of both mechanisms, programmed cell death is substantially
increased. Consistent with these observations, reduced PN1 protein correlated with
elevated p65/XIAP expression and with higher Gleason scores in human prostate
tissue arrays. Thus, PN1 expression appears to differentially down-regulate distinct
oncogenic pathways depending upon the cell surface receptor engaged by its
complexes and demonstrates a novel molecular mechanism by which the protein
can promote tumor cell apoptosis.

role in regulating cell death pathways [4]. Because its
overexpression is associated with cancer formation and
progression [5–7], drugs antagonistic to XIAP have shown
promise as cancer therapeutic agents [8].
XIAP is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis
(IAP) family of proteins that target caspases, the effector
molecules of cell death [9]. XIAP is able to effectively
bind and neutralise the activity of caspase-3, 7, and 9,
which together can drive the mitochondrial and death
receptor pathways of apoptosis [10, 11]. XIAP is one of
eight individual members of the IAP family, but is the

INTRODUCTION
A distinctive feature of tumor growth is uncontrolled
cell proliferation that largely bypasses the process of
programmed cell death, or apoptosis [1]. As hyperproliferative states contribute not only to tumor progression
but also to chemo- and radiotherapy resistance [2, 3],
selective targeting of pro-survival factors in tumor cells is
a possible approach to encourage recovery of the apoptotic
apparatus. XIAP (X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of
apoptosis protein) is a cellular factor that plays a central

most potent inhibitor as determined by strength of binding
to its caspase targets [9]. High levels of XIAP have been
associated with malignancy, and have also been found to
correlate with reduced survival rate and poorer outcomes
in clinical settings [12–15]. Consequently, many small
molecules or antisense nucleotides have been designed to
block XIAP and engage the cell death program [5, 16–
18], with varying success. Here, we show evidence that
an endogenous serine protease inhibitor, protease nexin-1
(PN1), leads to reduced expression of XIAP, resulting in
induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer.
PN1, known alternatively as SerpinE2 [19], is
secreted by a variety of cells, including endothelial cells,
fibroblasts, macrophages, astrocytes, and cancer cells
[20, 21]. PN1 can potently and irreversibly inhibit a variety
of serine proteases including urokinase plasminogen
activator (uPA), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), thrombin and plasmin [22]. We have previously
described a novel regulatory pathway in which PN1
blocks the invasion of prostate metastatic cells through the
regulation of uPA activity [23] and also demonstrated that
PN1 influences sonic hedgehog (SHH) levels, providing a
pathway by which PN1 can affect tumor cell proliferation
[24]. Engagement of the low density lipoprotein receptorrelated protein-1 (LRP-1) receptor proved critical for PN1mediated inhibition of the hedgehog pathway, blocking
proliferation in several prostate and pancreas cell lines
[24]. Intriguingly, overexpression of PN1 appeared to
concomitantly induce an apoptotic program independent
of Hedgehog pathway inhibition. Here we explore the
mechanism responsible for the effect of PN1 on apoptosis.
We have found that PN1-mediated inhibition of uPA
and its signalling through the uPA receptor (uPAR), but not
LRP-1, results in a downstream cascade of events leading
to a cellular reduction in XIAP. This can occur either
via 1) an alteration in NF-κB signalling, lessening xiap
transcription or 2) through a blockade of AKT signalling,
preventing the stabilizing phosphorylation of XIAP at
serine 87, therefore promoting the protein to degradation.
Thus, the PN1-uPA regulatory axis may be capable of
triggering apoptosis by modulating survival pathways and
as a result the growth of prostate cancer cells.

xenografts [24]. Here, increased cell death also occurs in
xenografts formed after innoculation with recombinant
PN1 in the Matrigel compared to controls (Sup. 1C).
Having validated that increased levels of PN1 can
enhance apoptosis, we sought to determine its effect on
known cell death regulatory proteins. Lysates from PC3
cells transfected with an empty vector (Mock) or a PN1
expression vector were evaluated using arrays to detect 35
pro- and anti-apoptotic factors (Figure 1A and Sup. 1D).
Of the proteins screened, only XIAP was significantly
reduced after PN1 expression. Conversely, levels of death
receptors 4/5 (DR4 and DR5) were increased. The changes
in XIAP and DR5 levels were verified using western
blotting (Figure 1B).

Combined PN1 and TRAIL treatment induces
growth lag in prostate cancer xenografts
These data (Figure 1 and Sup. 1) suggested that
PN1 might be an effective pro-death factor, particularly
if combined with other agents known to induce apoptosis
in cancer cells. DR4/ DR5 are receptors for TRAIL (TNFrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand), a cellular protein that
has shown promise as a cancer cell-selective agent [25,
26]. In PC3 cells, PN1 (2 μM) or human recombinant
TRAIL (200 ng/mL) added individually repressed cell
numbers after 24 hours in culture. Combination of the two
treatments had an additive effect, reducing cell number by
roughly 40% (Figure 1C).
To validate these results, PC3 xenografts were
generated in SCID mice to test the effect of PN1 on
tumor growth. Tumors were formed from cells injected
either in Matrigel alone or Matrigel supplemented with
PN1 (10 μM). These tumors were then treated with daily
administration of TRAIL (40 mg/kg) intraperitoneally
after tumors reached 100 mm3. The combinatorial effect
of PN1 exposure and TRAIL (post-treatment) of PC3
xenografts resulted in slower growth compared to control
(1,200 mm3 to 300 mm3) (Figure 1D & 1E). These data
support the hypothesis that PN1 could be a potentially
useful adjuvant therapy to treat prostate tumors in vivo.

XIAP mRNA expression is reduced by PN1
exposure

RESULTS

xiap RNA levels were determined using qRT-PCR
at 24 h following transfection of increasing concentrations
of the PN1 expression vector (Figure 2A) or after the
exogenous addition of recombinant PN1 protein (0.2 μM,
2 μM) to serum free cell medium (Figure 2B). In both
experiments, xiap RNA levels were inversely proportional
to PN1 levels. Conversely, siRNA against PN1 enhanced
xiap mRNA amounts (Figure 2C). To evaluate whether
inhibition of xiap by PN1 is more generalizable, additional
cell lines including two human leukemic cell lines (HL-60
and Jurkat) and a cervical cancer cell line (SIHA) were

XIAP protein levels
We show here and previously [24] that expression of
PN1 leads to the decreased growth and increased apoptosis
of prostate metastatic cells. Cell death, as determined by
TUNEL and Parp cleavage, increased in PC3 cells after
PN1 overexpression (Sup. 1A & B). If injected within
Matrigel, PC3 cells can be reliably grown subcutaneously
as murine xenografts. Previously, we showed that
addition of PN1 to Matrigel delayed the growth of these

tested. In all three cell lines, PN1 expression reduced xiap
mRNA levels (Sup. 2).
To determine if PN1-mediated change in XIAP
levels was prevalent in vivo, brain, liver, lung, bladder,
seminal vesicle (Sup. 3A) and prostate (Sup. 3B) tissue
lysates from C57WT or PN1 knock mice were obtained.
ELISA detection of XIAP showed increases in the brain
and the urologic organs (prostate, seminal vesicle, and
bladder) when PN1 is genetically ablated from the animal.
Interestingly, in lung and liver the trend was reversed.
A western blot was performed to further validate XIAP
levels and showed substantial increases in the prostates
of wild type mice versus PN1 knock-out mice (Sup. 3C).

cells led to an elevation of xiap RNA (Figure 3C). In
contrast, down-regulation of endogenous uPA resulted in
lowered xiap expression (Figure 3D), confirming positive
regulation of xiap by uPA in this system. When uPA was
depleted by siRNA, overexpression of PN1 did not further
inhibit xiap (Figure 3Dii). Thus, uPA appears essential for
the PN1-mediated down-regulation of xiap.

PN1-mediated XIAP regulation requires uPAR
signalling
Both LRP-1 and uPAR have been described as
membrane receptors that propagate cellular signals
after binding protease-PN1 complexes. We previously
engineered point mutations into PN1 at its LRP and
RCL binding sites [24], both of which are critical for the
efficacy of the serpin against Hedgehog signalling. As
expected, the RCL mutant (m-RCL) reversed the ability
of PN1 to inhibit XIAP. The RCL site is responsible for
PN1 binding to its targets, including uPA. However,
overexpression of PN1 containing the LRP mutant

PN1 can regulate XIAP by impeding uPA
uPA activity has been reported to regulate XIAP
transcription [27]. PN1 inhibits the activity of uPA shown
here in PC3 cells using overexpression of PN1 vector, or
deletion of PN1 with siRNA (Figure 3A–3B). Addition

(m-LRP) did not rescue XIAP at a protein level
(Figure 3E). As a result, we then asked whether downregulation of either of these receptors would alter the
extent of xiap mRNA. Experiments using siRNA against
LRP (Sup. 4, left) failed to show induced alterations of
xiap. On the other hand, knock-down of uPAR expression
by siRNA reduced xiap levels (Sup. 4, right).
An additional experiment was conducted at
the protein level employing LRP and uPAR blocking
antibodies (50 μg/ml each) in conjunction with a
sandwich ELISA system for the detection of XIAP.
Once more, inhibition of uPAR made a substantial
impact on total XIAP protein while its levels were
relatively static following LRP blockade (Figure 3F).
We also used immunoblotting to further investigate
the consequence of blocking membrane receptors on

down-stream signalling (Figure 3G). Antibody blockade
of LRP-1 altered SHH levels as we found previously
[24]. In contrast, XIAP was not significantly affected
by blocking antibodies to LRP-1. However, when
uPAR was inhibited, XIAP, but not SHH, was downregulated. This suggests PN1 complexes interact with
uPAR but not LRP in mediating XIAP levels and
survival signalling. Thus, the response of the cell to
PN1 protease complexes is determined by the cellular
receptors transmitting the signal.

xiap mRNA through the NF-κB pathway, we used an
NF-κB inhibitor (BAY 11–7082). As expected, the
inhibitor alone reduced xiap expression. That effect was
amplified by expression of PN1 protein (Figure 4A). Using
immunoblotting of cells and murine prostate tissue, we
found that alterations in PN1 levels resulted in alterations
in expression of various components of the NF-κB
pathway. In PC3 cells, elevation of PN1 reduced levels
of the NF-κB activating sub-unit, p65 (Figure 4B) and
correlated with reduced amounts of XIAP. Interestingly,
p65 was not only decreased but cleaved, which typically
occurs when there is increased caspase activity [30]. This
cleavage can inactivate p65 transcriptional capabilities
[30, 31] and supports the hypothesis that reduction in
XIAP via PN1 leads to a program of cell death.
We further evaluated the expression pattern of
these molecules in the Matrigel plug model of tumor
growth (Figure 4C–4D). XIAP and p65 levels were
reduced in the Matrigel plugs with added PN1. These
results are in agreement with the increased apoptosis
measured by TUNEL assay (Sup. 1A–1C). Thus, PN1

appears to be important both in vitro and in vivo in the
regulation of XIAP and resulting cell death.

PN1 destabilizes XIAP through AKT signalling
in prostate cancer cells
Another pathway positively associated with XIAP
levels in prostate cancer is AKT [32]. AKT inhibition via
LY 294002 (10 μM) alone or in combination with PN1
expression, reduced xiap expression (Figure 5A). PN1
overexpression resulted in both increased total AKT
amounts and decreased phosphorylation (Figure 5B).
Previously, Dan et al described a system in ovarian cancer
cells in which XIAP is phosphorylated by activated AKT
at serine-87, an event that acts to stabilize the protein
and prevent its auto-ubiquitination [33]. Increased
serine-87 phosphorylation and total XIAP were observed
in the prostates of pn1−/− mice compared to wild type
(Figure 5C). Additionally, phospho-AKT was lower in
wild type mice than pn1−/− mice. These observations
suggest that XIAP stability may be preserved in the

cells by exposure to the AKT inhibitor, MK-2206
(Figure 5D). When treated with 10 ng/mL of MK-2206
following PN1 overexpression, both total XIAP and XIAP
phospho-serine-87 were substantially decreased. These
data strongly suggest that the AKT pathway is important
for XIAP protein stability in prostate cancer cells and that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PN1-driven signalling is a factor. The lack of change in
p65 protein after MK-2206 treatment shows that AKT
signalling is independent from NF-κB in prostate cells.
Finally, in Matrigel xenografts, p-AKT levels were lower
in Matrigel tumor plugs containing PN1 (Figure 5E–5F).
These findings are consistent with PN1 having the capacity
to diminish AKT signalling in prostate tumors.

Elevated p65 and XIAP levels are indicators of
advanced prostate cancer

concomitant with higher p65/XIAP, matching observed
expression patterns in our tissue culture and animal models.

Elevated XIAP has been observed in prostate cancer
[14]. Here we show co-expression of p65 and XIAP in
the more advanced prostate cancers (Gleason 8–10), and
that PN1 protein is concurrently decreased (Figure 6A).
XIAP and p65 proteins localize largely to the epithelium,
and are sparse in the tumor stroma. The expression of
both increased with Gleason score, and exhibits a strong
correlation (Spearman correlation analysis, r = .69, p =
.00001). PN1 expression displayed a trend of decreasing in
the presence of increasing p65 or XIAP (Figure 6B–6D).
Overall, prostate tumors featured high variability in the
intensity of all proteins stained, whereas benign control
prostate displayed a much tighter range. This could
be a reflection of prostate cancer heterogeneity, which
is common in the stromal microenvironment, and is
also where PN1 protein is primarily expressed [34, 35].
However, the general trend of expression in these human
tissues was consistent with a gradual reduction in PN1

DISCUSSION

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Our previous work demonstrated that PN1
expression in cultured PC3 cells induces cell rounding
and anoikis, slows cell division, and promotes cleavage
and activation of capase-3 and PARP, all consistent
with apoptosis [23, 24]. We have also shown that
PN1 can modulate signalling through uPA and the
Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway, leading to reduced
proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells, and
tumor growth delay in various in vivo models [24, 36].
However, overexpression of PN1 greatly increased cell
death beyond that caused by inhibition of the hedgehog
pathway, suggesting the contribution of the serpin to
apoptotic signalling. Here, we have shown evidence that
PN1 expression substantially represses XIAP levels.
Further investigation also indicates that PN1 could
regulate XIAP in two distinct ways, firstly via control of

Figure 6: Elevated p65 and XIAP levels are indicators of advanced prostate cancer. (A) DAB-staining of PN1, p65 and
XIAP in human prostatic tissue. Measurement of staining intensity comparing normal prostate tissue (n = 12) versus a subdivision of
prostate cancer into Gleason scores 6–7 (n = 14) or 8–10 (n = 22). One-way ANOVA performed. Correlation between groups (B–D)
calculated using Spearman’s r-value.

RNA levels (Figure 3–4) and also through stabilization of
the XIAP molecule itself (Figure 5).
XIAP is the most potent cellular inhibitor of
caspases, and an important survival factor. Numerous
studies have focused on this protein as a target for
degradation in cells that exhibit cancer-like characteristics
[37]. XIAP can be inhibited at the physiological level by
smac/diablo, which acts to displace XIAP from its target
caspases [38]. To date, most pharmacological approaches
have concentrated primarily on producing small-molecule
inhibitors that mimic this mechanism. We show here that
another endogenous molecule, PN1, can inhibit XIAP, in
tissue culture and in vivo, to promote cell death in prostate
tumor cells.
Firstly, PN1 was shown to regulate XIAP at the
mRNA level (Figure 2). How PN1 might propagate

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

its signal from the extracellular matrix (ECM) was
examined. We found that uPA activity, an ECM target
of PN1, correlated with XIAP mRNA levels. This is in
accordance with a previous study that implicates uPA
in the transcriptional regulation of XIAP in endothelial
cells [27]. In that model, uPA regulated transcriptional
signalling through binding to its receptor, uPAR. We
observed similar results in our study, where biochemical
inhibition of uPA or its membrane receptors modulated
xiap mRNA levels (Figure 3). PN1 is also known to
target thrombin, especially in the process of coagulation.
However, the effect of PN1 upon thrombin is not widely
known to induce apoptosis or proliferation changes in
prostate cancer cells. Here the data suggest that com­
plexation of uPA-uPAR in the ECM is itself important to
the downstream signalling that drives XIAP. As an uPA

3791

Oncotarget

inhibitor highly prevalent in the ECM, PN1 is in a position
to impede this process and therefore mitigate XIAP
expression and ultimately apoptosis in cancer cells.
We showed previously that PN1-uPA complexes
preferentially signal through the LRP-1 to control SHH
signalling in prostate cancer. In line with these results,
blockade of LRP-1 inhibited SHH levels (Figure 3G).
However, the same treatment induced no detectable effect
on XIAP levels. Instead, down-regulation or blockade
of uPAR prevented the cell’s ability to express XIAP.
The response was similar to that seen after PN1 overexpression. These results suggest that binding to different
receptors by PN1-uPA complexes may control different
signalling pathways in prostate cancer cells. An intriguing
question for future studies is whether uPAR-beta-integrin
signalling may contribute to this discrepancy, especially
as association of these factors have been linked to cancer
progression [39] and may influence invasion of prostate
metastatic cells [40].
PN1 expression was shown to alter the NF-κB
pathway. NF-κB signalling transcriptionally regulates
a number of anti-apoptotic genes, most importantly
XIAP itself. In a cell culture model and in matrigel plug
tumors (Figure 4), we show that certain NF-κB subunits, particularly p65/p50, were strongly repressed,
consistent with the blockade of the canonical NF-κB
pathway. Downstream XIAP levels were reduced in
line with decreases in p65 levels. Interestingly, the p65
protein is itself cleaved to a 40 kD fragment when PN1
is highly expressed. This is a process that occurs when
p65 is degraded through caspase activation [41], which is
consistent with the higher cell death generally observed
during increased PN1 expression.
A further novel observation made in this study
is that the phosphorylation of AKT is altered in mice
with genetic ablation of PN1, or in xenografts that have
been exposed to PN1 pre-treatments (Figure 5). uPA is
able to promote AKT signalling through uPAR [42, 43].
Additionally, prior studies have determined that AKT
signalling is associated with the stabilization of XIAP
via phosphorylation at serine 87 [33]. Our data shows
that when PN1 is removed from the system, such as
in pn1−/− mice, increased total and phosphorylated
XIAP is observed. This would suggest protection from
auto-ubiquitnation and resistance to cell death. Thus,
impeded AKT signalling would represent a second arm
of PN1-mediated control of XIAP and help explain why
such robust changes in cell death can be observed after
expression (Figure 7). Importantly, obstructing the AKT
system using specific inhibitors such as MK-2206 does not
appear to impact the NF-κB pathway, as p65 levels remain
stable. This implies independence of these two signalling
pathways (Figure 5D).
These findings reveal novel regulatory targets
for PN1 and suggest a greater potential in impeding
tumor growth and metastasis. Reducing XIAP with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

siRNA affects viability in several cell lines and can
dramatically sensitize tumor cell to TRAIL mediated
apoptosis [44]. These observations match our apoptotic
array data showing PN1-induced TRAIL-R1 (DR4)
and TRAIL-R2 (DR5) expression simultaneous with
decreased XIAP. Treatments of PC3 cells with a
combination of PN1 and TRAIL recombinant proteins
significantly reduced tumor growth in xenografts
(Figure 1D–1E), suggesting a potent sensitization of
prostate tumor cells to death signals.
Additionally, staining from human prostate tissue
microarrays (TMAs) show an inverse correlation between
PN1 expression and XIAP (Figure 6). PN1 levels are
decreased in a step-wise fashion from their highest
expression in normal prostate tissue to near ablation in
the most advanced cancer (Gleason 8–10). Furthermore,
advanced prostate cancer expressed significant levels of
p65 concomitant with XIAP. This data could suggest that
another avenue of treating severe CaP may entail blocking
both NF-κB signalling in addition to XIAP.
Our data provides evidence that PN1 can regulate
signalling by neutralising complexes uPA-uPAR and
altering downstream pathways that contribute to the
transcriptional activation and stabilization of the survival
factor XIAP in prostate cancer cells. As a result, PN1
levels may affect the overall severity of prostate cancer.
Therefore, induction of PN1-mediated signalling may be
useful for enhancing XIAP-specific inhibition by small
molecule compounds in cancer therapy.

METHODS
Animals
pn1−/− mice were a generous gift from MC Bouton
(Université Paris, Paris, France). All knock out animals
were compared against littermate controls. All animal
experiments and protocols were reviewed and performed
in accordance with UK Home Office and Oxford
University regulations.

Plasmids and mutagenesis
pcDNA3-PN1 was a kind gift from Dr Peter
Andreasen’s lab (Aarhus, Denmark). A range of point
mutations were generated previously as described [24].

Cell culture and treatment
Cancer cell lines PC3, SIHA, Jurkat and HL-60
cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and regularly tested to ensure the
absence of Mycoplasma contamination (MycoAlert,
Lonza). New stock vials were thawed every 3–4
months and cell morphology regularly checked.
All cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified

Figure 7: Model Figure. PN1 expression mediates apoptosis via regulation of XIAP. PN1 can affect this regulation through down-

regulation of the NF-κB pathway activator p65, impeding XIAP transcription. Alternately, PN1 activity can reduce the stability of XIAP
by preventing a stabilizing phosphorylation at serine-87, mediated by the AKT pathway. The dual regulation of XIAP is facilitated through
inhibition of uPA and altered signalling through uPAR.

XIAP ELISA

Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
FBS at 37°C with 5% CO2. PN1 expression vectors
were transfected into cells using FuGENE 6 reagent
(Roche). All transfection experiments performed for 24
h unless otherwise noted. Where indicated, inhibitors,
recombinant proteins, or blocking antibodies were
added to serum free medium during treatments: NF-κB
inhibitor Bay11–7082 (BIOMOL Research laboratories,
PA), PI3k/AKT inhibitor LY 294002 (Calbiochem),
AKT inhibitor MK-2206 (Santa Cruz), recombinant
uPA (America Diagnostica), recombinant PN1 (R&D
system), uPAR blocking antibody (R&D Systems),
and LRP blocking antibody (Progen, Germany).
Recombinant human TRAIL was generated as described
[45]. uPA activity was measured using a uPA Activity
Assay kit (Millipore), per manufacturer’s instructions.
Measurements were taken at 405 nM on a Tecan m200
plate reader.

All ELISA detection of XIAP protein was performed
using the Human Total XIAP DuoSet IC (R&D Systems,
DYC822) according to factory instructions. Briefly,
10 μg of cell lysate was combined with a provided XIAP
capture antibody fused to the bottom of a 96 well plate
overnight. Then a streptavidin-linked detection antibody
was applied for 2 h before a substrate was added (20 min)
for colorimetric detection at 450 nM using a Tecan m200
plate reader.

RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR
RNA was extracted by Trizol and the RNA
concentration was measured by a Nano-Drop 1000
spectrophotometer (Thermo). All qRT-PCR reaction
mixtures were prepared using Superscript Platinum III
one step kits with incorporated SYBR Green (Invitrogen).
One step cDNA production and DNA amplification were
performed on a Stratagene MX 3005P thermocycler. All
amplified products normalized against GAPDH. Amplified
products confirmed by electrophoresis using 1.5% highresolution agarose gels.

Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry
Cell pellets were lysed in TNN buffer containing
protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem). 50 μg of protein
was loaded into 10% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Blots were
probed with the indicated antibodies: anti-PN1, XIAP,
DR5 (R&D Systems), beta-actin (Santa Cruz), p-AKT,
PARP, all NF-κB molecules (Cell Signalling), and uPA
(Abnova).
All immunohistochemistry was performed on tissues
harvested from wild type C57/B6 or pn1−/− animals on
a B6 background. All harvested tissues were fixed for
24 hours in 4% paraformaldehyde and sliced at 10 μM
thickness for staining. Briefly, microscope slide mounted
tissues were hydrated and exposed to an antibody at a 1:50
dilution overnight following antigen retrieval (Sodium
Citrate, 20 min at 90°C). Pre-diluted Immpact secondary
antibody (Vector Labs) was applied to the slides for 30 min
and Immpact DAB (Vector Labs) was added to observe
positive stain. Samples were evaluated microscopically
and photographs were taken on a 20× objective.

siRNA
siRNA directed against pn1,upa, lrp, upar, and
siRNA negative control oligos were from Ambion.
10 nM of each siRNA was transfected into cells using the
siPORTNeoFX transfection agent (Ambion). After 48 h,
cells were washed and the media replaced with serum free
media. Conditioned media was collected 24 h later.

Matrigel plugs
Briefly, 1 × 106 PC3 cells (suspended in 50 μl of
serum free media and 50 μl of Matrigel supplemented
with recombinant PN1 as indicated) were injected
subcutaneously into the flanks of adult SCID mice as
previously described. When distinct individual tumors
reached 100 mm3, TRAIL/apo2 was administered at 40
mg/kg, daily by IP, in appropriate treatment groups. Tumor
volumes were determined from calliper measurements of
the tumor dimensions at the indicated times.

Apoptotic assays
Apoptotic Protein arrays (R&D Systems, ARY009)
were used to probe for alterations in protein amounts.
PC3 cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection
with PN1 expression vectors and 300 μg of lysate was
diluted in blocking buffer. This solution was incubated
with an apoptotic protein array containing 35 pro- or
anti-apoptotic proteins overnight at 2–8°C. After 3×
washing with PBS, reconstituted Detection Antibody
Cocktail was added to the membrane and incubated for 1
hour. The membrane was then subjected to StreptavidinHRP followed by a chemiluminescent reagent, per
manufacturer’s instructions.

Tissue array and immunohistochemistry
Human tissue microarrays (PR956b; BioMax)
contained samples from 36 cases of prostate cancer
with various Gleason scores and 12 examples of normal
prostate tissue. TMA staining was assessed using a
combination of intensity and percentage of positive
stained cells, as previously described [46]. The slides were
analysed by two independent pathologists.
