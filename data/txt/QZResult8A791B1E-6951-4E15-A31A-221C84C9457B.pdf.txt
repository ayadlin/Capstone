Abstract
The Met receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand, hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF), are overexpressed and/or activated in
a wide variety of human malignancies. Vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) receptors are expressed on the surface
of vascular endothelial cells and cooperate with Met to induce tumor invasion and vascularization. EXEL-2880 (XL880,
GSK1363089) is a small-molecule kinase inhibitor that targets
members of the HGF and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase families, with additional inhibitory activity toward KIT, Flt-3,
platelet-derived growth factor receptor B, and Tie-2. Binding
of EXEL-2880 to Met and VEGF receptor 2 (KDR) is characterized by a very slow off-rate, consistent with X-ray crystallographic data showing that the inhibitor is deeply bound in
the Met kinase active site cleft. EXEL-2880 inhibits cellular
HGF-induced Met phosphorylation and VEGF-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and prevents
both HGF-induced responses of tumor cells and HGF/VEGFinduced responses of endothelial cells. In addition, EXEL-2880
prevents anchorage-independent proliferation of tumor cells
under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In vivo, these
effects produce significant dose-dependent inhibition of
tumor burden in an experimental model of lung metastasis.
Collectively, these data indicate that EXEL-2880 may prevent
tumor growth through a direct effect on tumor cell proliferation and by inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis mediated
by HGF and VEGF receptors. [Cancer Res 2009;69(20):8009–16]

Introduction
Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is widely expressed
in epithelial and endothelial cells, whereas its ligand, hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF), is expressed by cells of the mesenchymal
lineage (1). Met is a central mediator of cell growth, survival,
motility, and morphogenesis during development; however, its role
in adults appears to be primarily confined to repair/regeneration
following injury of tissues such as the liver (2). Overexpression of
Met has been widely documented in many human tumor types (1,
3) and activating Met mutations have been identified in hereditary

and sporadic papillary renal cell carcinoma (4, 5), in gastric (6),
hepatocellular (7), head and neck (8), and ovarian (9) carcinomas,
and in other tumor types including small cell lung cancer (10),
breast cancer (11), and glioma (12). Notably, Met mutations appear
to be particularly prevalent in metastatic lesions, consistent with
a role for Met in promoting tumor invasion and dissemination
(8, 13). Met gene amplification has been found in gastric and colorectal tumors (14–17) and was recently proposed as a mechanism
for acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor
inhibitors in lung cancer (18, 19). Clinically, overexpression and/
or dysregulation of Met and/or HGF correlates with a poor
prognostic outcome in patients with a diverse array of malignancies (20–24).
The negative prognostic consequences of Met dysregulation in
tumors reflect its multiple roles in tumor pathobiology (reviewed in
refs. 1, 3). Activated Met promotes cancer cell growth and survival
and increases their motility and invasiveness, facilitating tumor
metastasis. In addition, activation of Met in endothelial cells by
HGF promotes tumor angiogenesis. Dysregulation of Met signaling
results in enhanced tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in engineered cells and in transgenic mice (25–28). Conversely, inhibition of Met signaling using ribozymes, antisense RNA, anti-HGF
antibodies, or an inhibitory fragment of HGF inhibits growth of
tumor xenografts in mice (29–35).
The receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
VEGF receptor 1 and VEGF receptor 2/KDR, are expressed on the
surface of vascular endothelial cells and on some bone marrow–
derived cells (36). When activated, these receptors mediate endothelial cell invasion, proliferation, and survival. VEGF expression is
up-regulated in many human tumors, and activation of KDR by
VEGF is believed to be a major driver of tumor angiogenesis.
Consistent with this, inhibition of VEGF signaling in preclinical
models inhibits tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth (36, 37). The
anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab (Avastin) has shown
therapeutic benefit in patients, and many other antiangiogenic
agents are undergoing clinical trials.
In addition to their individual roles in tumor pathobiology, Met
and KDR cooperate to promote tumor angiogenesis. Expression of
Met is regulated by the same hypoxia-inducible factor system that
governs VEGF expression levels; hence, both Met and VEGF are
induced in response to tumor hypoxia (38). This may explain the
observation that the presence of tumor hypoxia is a negative prognostic indicator for tumor dissemination and patient prognosis
(39). There is also evidence for cooperativity between Met and KDR
in endothelial cells: simultaneous administration of HGF and VEGF
in cultured primary endothelial cells confers a greater proliferative
stimulus and proangiogenic effect than either ligand alone (40).

These findings suggest that simultaneous inhibition of Met and
KDR by a small-molecule inhibitor may confer broad and potent
antitumor efficacy.
We report here the characterization of EXEL-2880, an inhibitor
of the HGF and VEGF RTK families. EXEL-2880 binds tightly to
Met and KDR with a very slow off-rate, consistent with the mode
of binding revealed by X-ray crystallography. EXEL-2880 inhibits
cellular HGF-induced Met phosphorylation and VEGF-induced
extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and inhibits
growth of tumor cells under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions
with increased potency against Met-amplified gastric cancer cell
lines. In vitro, EXEL-2880 inhibits HGF-induced responses of tumor
cells and HGF/VEGF-induced responses of endothelial cells that
are thought to contribute to invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis
in vivo. Consistent with this profile, EXEL-2880 inhibits tumor formation in an in vivo murine model of lung metastasis. EXEL-2880
therefore has the potential to prevent tumor growth through a
direct effect on tumor cell proliferation and indirectly through
inhibition of the host angiogenic response.

Materials and Methods
Compound. EXEL-2880 (Supplementary Fig. S1) was synthesized at
Exelixis (41) and its synthesis will be reported separately. The compound
was licensed to GSK in December 2007 and is now called GSK1363089.
Kinase inhibition assays. Kinase inhibition was investigated using one
of three assay formats: [33P]phosphoryl transfer, luciferase-coupled
chemiluminescence, or AlphaScreen tyrosine kinase technology (PerkinElmer). Further assay details are provided in Supplementary Section. IC50
values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using XLFit.
Expression and X-ray crystallography of Met receptor. The Met
kinase domain (1051-1348) was expressed with a NH2-terminal histidine
tag and Tobacco Etch Virus protease cleavage site (MLLGSHHHHHHGENLYFQGS) in Sf9 insect cells using a modified pAcGP67 baculovirus DNA
transfer vector (BD Pharmingen). Further details of protein purification and
X-ray crystallography are provided in Supplementary Section.
Cell lines, cell culture conditions, and cytotoxic screening. Cell lines
B16F10, PC-3, A549, HT29, and MDA-MB-231 were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection and propagated using recommended
conditions. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L), and normal human dermal fibroblasts
were obtained from Clonetics and propagated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For cytotoxic screening, a panel of 91 cancer cell lines
was purchased (American Type Culture Collection; Developmental Therapeutics Program, National Cancer Institute; German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures; and European Collection of Cell Cultures) and
maintained according to the supplier’s specifications or RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol/L Glutamax, and
1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate. Microarray analysis was done as described in
Supplementary Data. These data are available at https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/
caArray_GSKdata/.
Target receptor phosphorylation assays. PC-3 and B16F10 cells were
seeded in 24-well plates overnight. The cells were then washed and
incubated with serum-free medium for 3 h followed by a 1 h incubation
with EXEL-2880 before addition of HGF (100 ng/mL; R&D Systems) for
10 min. Met phosphorylation status was determined by ELISA analysis
(Supplementary Data). For determination of VEGF-stimulated extracellular
signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, human umbilical vein endothelial
cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h and then serumstarved for another 24 h. A serial dilution of EXEL-2880 was added for
1 h before a 5 min stimulation with VEGF (20 ng/mL; R&D Systems). Medium was removed, and the cells were fixed with Cytofix (BD Pharmingen)
and then treated with 0.6% H2O2. Plates were blocked with 10% FBS and
incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphorylated extracellular
signal-regulated kinase p44/42 antibody (E10; Cell Signaling Technology)

followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase
(BD Pharmingen) and chemiluminescent detection. IC50 values were calculated based on triplicate experiments.
HGF-induced migration assay. B16F10 cells (2  105) were seeded onto
0.8 Am membranes in the top chamber of a 96-well Transwell plate in
DMEM containing a serial dilution of EXEL-2880 and 0.1% FBS. DMEM
containing HGF (50 ng/mL), 0.2% FBS, and EXEL-2880 was added to the
bottom chamber, and after 24 h, the medium was removed and Accutase
(ISC BioExpress) was added to the bottom chamber. After 30 min, cells were
transferred to a V-bottomed 96-well plate, centrifuged, and resuspended in
HBSS containing 2 mg/mL calcein-AM (Molecular Probes). After incubation
for 30 min, cells were transferred into a black 96-well plate. Fluorescence
emission was measured at 480 nm using an excitation wavelength of 520 nm
and imaged with a fluorescence microscope.
HGF-induced invasion assay. Growth factor reduced Matrigel (15 AL;
BD Pharmingen) was coated onto 0.8 Am membranes in 96-well Transwell
plates (Millipore) and incubated for 30 min. B16F10 cells (1  105) were
plated in the top chamber in DMEM containing dilutions of EXEL-2880 and
0.1% FBS. HGF (50 ng/mL), 0.2% FBS, and EXEL-2880 were added to the
bottom chamber. After 24 h, the medium was removed and the cells
visualized as described for the migration assay above.
Soft-agar assay. B16F10, A549, and HT29 cells (1.2  103 per well) were
mixed with soft agar and seeded in a 96-well plate containing 10% FBS and
EXEL-2880 over a base agar layer. For normoxic conditions, the plates were
incubated (37jC) for 12 to 14 days in 21% oxygen, 5% CO2, and 74% nitrogen,
whereas incubation (37jC) under hypoxic conditions was done in a hypoxia
chamber (IN VIVO2 400; Biotrace) in 1% oxygen, 5% CO2, and 94% nitrogen.
The number of colonies was evaluated under each condition following
addition of 50% Alamar Blue (Invitrogen) and fluorescence detection.
Endothelial tubule formation and migration assays. Normal human
dermal fibroblasts were plated at 2.5  104 per well in 96-well plates and
incubated under for 24 h. HMVEC-L cells (6  103 per well) were plated
onto the normal human dermal fibroblast cultures with 60 ng/mL VEGF
or conditioned medium (MDA-MB-231 or B16F10 cells) and EXEL-2880.
The cocultures were incubated for 7 days after which cells were fixed
with Cytofix (BD Pharmingen) and stained with 2 Ag/mL CD31 antibody
(clone WM-59; BD Biosciences) followed by anti-mouse IgG-horseradish
peroxidase (DAKOCytomation) and AEC color development reagent
(DAKOCytomation). Digital images (20) were taken and total tube length
was quantified with Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics). IC50
values were calculated based on the average total tubule length achieved in
cultures treated with EXEL-2880 compared with cultures treated with VEGF
alone. HMVEC-L cells were plated in 96-well plates coated with fibronectin
(BD Biosciences), and when confluent, a cell-free zone was introduced into
each well using a pipette tip. The cultures were treated with EXEL-2880 in
serum-free medium followed by addition of VEGF (30 ng/mL) or HGF
(60 ng/mL) in duplicate overnight. The cultures were stained with 0.2 Ag/mL
calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) for visualization and a quantitative assessment of inhibition of migration was done for each condition.
Cytotoxicity assay. HMVEC-L cells were seeded at 5  103 per well in
96-well plates and incubated for 24 h, after which a serial dilution of EXEL2880 in serum-free medium was added for a further 24 h and cell viability
was determined (Alamar Blue; Biosource).
Animals. Female athymic nude mice (NCr or BALB/c) 5 to 8 weeks old
were purchased from Taconic. Animals were housed and treated according
to the guidelines outlined by the Exelixis Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
Pharmacodynamic studies. In vivo target modulation studies were
done in naive mice or mice bearing B16F10 tumors. EXEL-2880 or vehicle
(0.9% normal saline) was administered at 10 mL/kg via oral gavage. For
examination of Met phosphorylation in liver, HGF (10 Ag/mouse) was
administered i.v. 10 min before harvest. For examination of Flk-1/KDR
phosphorylation in lung, VEGF (10 Ag/mouse) was administered i.v. 30 min
before harvest 0.5 h later (42). Receptor phosphorylation analysis was
determined by immunoblot analysis.
Efficacy studies. B16F10 tumor cells (2  105) were implanted via i.v. tail
vein injection into mice on day 0. EXEL-2880 or vehicle administration was

EXEL-2880 Inhibits HGF and VEGF Receptor Tyrosine Kinases
initiated 3 days after implantation for 10 days followed by assessment of
lung tumor burden. Lungs were excised, weighed, and zinc-fixed for 24 h,
and the number of nodules formed on all lobe surfaces was counted using a
Zeiss stereoscope (Carl Zeiss). Lung nodule diameters were morphometrically measured on digitally captured images. Inhibition of tumor burden
as measured by lung wet weight was calculated as follows: % tumor growth
inhibition = [(compound treated-naive / vehicle-naive)  100]. The results
for each treatment group (n = 10 animals) were averaged, and statistical
t test analysis was done comparing each treatment group to the vehicletreated control.

Results
Inhibition of RTKs. EXEL-2880 inhibits HGF receptor family
tyrosine kinases with IC50 values of 0.4 nmol/L for Met and 3 nmol/L
for Ron. EXEL-2880 also inhibits KDR, Flt-1, and Flt-4 with IC50
values of 0.9, 6.8, and 2.8 nmol/L, respectively. In addition, EXEL2880 inhibits members of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor
family and the angiopoietin-1 receptor Tie-2 (Table 1). EXEL-2880
exhibits modest activity against fibroblast growth factor receptor 1
and epidermal growth factor receptor and is inactive against 50
serine/threonine kinases, including cyclin-dependent kinases and
protein kinase C isoforms (data not shown).
To determine the mechanism of inhibition by EXEL-2880, IC50
determinations for Met and KDR were done in the presence of
increasing concentrations of ATP. Figure 1 shows that the IC50 values
increase linearly with increasing ATP concentration, showing that
EXEL-2880 is an ATP-competitive active site inhibitor. The reversibility of enzyme inhibition by EXEL-2880 was also evaluated for
Met and KDR. Following 10-fold dilution with 2 mmol/L ATP, f10%
activity for both kinases was observed after 180 min. Measurements
beyond this time were not feasible due to instability of the enzyme.
K MATP values of 2 Amol/L were determined for both Met and KDR
using the same assay format. Thus, at 2 mmol/L ATP, >90% recovery
of enzyme activity is expected to occur at equilibrium, and from
this, a dissociation half life of f15 h can be estimated. The kinetic
constants for EXEL-2880 binding to Met and KDR reveal it to be tightly
bound with a long dissociation half-life (Supplementary Table S1).
Structure of EXEL-2880 in complex with Met. Met was
cocrystallized with EXEL-2880 and the X-ray crystal structure was
solved and refined to a resolution of 2.0 Å (Fig. 2). The structure of

Figure 1. Mechanism of kinase inhibition. In vitro kinase assays for Met (A) and
KDR (B) were done using increasing concentrations of ATP. Resulting IC50
values were plotted as a function of ATP concentration and shown to exhibit a
linear relationship.

the complex shows that EXEL-2880 is well-ordered when bound to
Met, occupies the ATP-binding site as well as an adjacent pocket,
and makes both important hydrogen bonds and extensive hydrophobic contacts with the protein—many of which are external to
the ATP binding pocket. The phenyl malonamide moiety of EXEL2880 dislodges the phenylalanine of the DFG motif (Phe1223) from
its activated conformation (‘‘Phe-in’’) binding pocket under the
C-helix (43). Phe1223 then reorients by f13 Å and forms a stabilized
stacking interaction with the central fluorophenyl ring of EXEL2880. This places the kinase in a pseudo-unactivated conformation
where the catalytic machinery has been disrupted (‘‘Phe-out’’). On

EXEL-2880 forms one hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Met1160 in
the kinase linker; three additional hydrogen bonds are formed between the
malonamide and Met atoms. A water-mediated hydrogen bond is also shown
(water in red ). Phe1223 of the activation loop ‘‘DFG’’ (orange sticks ) has relocated
from the position in the active conformation to stack underneath the fluorophenyl

binding, a total of 1,225 Å2 of surface area is buried. This is facilitated by the reorganization of the activation loop, which almost
entirely buries the ligand, sequestering it from solvent and greatly
enhancing the binding affinity.
Inhibition of cellular RTKs. Consistent with the biochemical
data described above, EXEL-2880 is a potent inhibitor of cellular
Met with IC50 values of 23 and 21 nmol/L, respectively, in PC-3
prostate cells and murine B16F10 melanoma cells. To further
delineate the cellular effect of EXEL-2880, we used VEGF-induced
extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation to assess the
effect of the compound on phosphorylation of KDR in human umbilical vein endothelial cells that resulted in an IC50 of 16 nmol/L.
Inhibition of tumor cell migration, invasion, and soft-agar
growth. The ability of EXEL-2880 to inhibit HGF-stimulated migration and invasion was tested using in vitro assays (44). Murine
B16F10 melanoma cells express high levels of Met, which becomes
highly phosphorylated when the cells are treated with HGF

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (20). October 15, 2009

(Fig. 3A). B16F10 cells plated in the top well of a Transwell
chamber containing a barrier with 0.8 Am pores show very little
ability to migrate to the bottom chamber. Addition of HGF to the
bottom chamber greatly increased migration through the barrier
over a 24 h period, which was blocked by EXEL-2880 with an IC50
value of 44 nmol/L (Fig. 3C). Addition of HGF to the bottom
chamber again produced a large increase in the number of cells
migrating through a Matrigel barrier in response to HGF, and EXEL2880 inhibited this effect with an IC50 value of 25 nmol/L (Fig. 3D).
To test the effect of EXEL-2880 on anchorage-independent tumor
cell growth, tumor cell suspensions were plated in soft agar and
colony formation was monitored for 12 to 14 days. EXEL-2880
inhibited colony growth of B16F10 cells with an IC50 value of
40 nmol/L (Fig. 3B). Human cell lines A549 and HT29 resulted in
IC50 values of 29 and 165 nmol/L, respectively (data not shown).
Additionally, this experiment was repeated using A549 cells under
hypoxic cell culture conditions, which resulted in a colony formation inhibition IC50 value of 18 nmol/L.
Inhibition of endothelial tubule formation and migration.
When plated on a confluent layer of normal human diploid fibroblast cells, HMVEC-L cells form extensive networks of tubules
in response to VEGF (Fig. 4A). However, when coincubated with
EXEL-2880, VEGF-induced tubule formation was inhibited with an
IC50 value of 3 nmol/L, which was similar to the IC50 value obtained
using the VEGF-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase
phosphorylation assay described above. As shown in Fig. 4B, conditioned medium derived from MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma and B16F10 murine melanoma cell cultures stimulated robust
tubule formation of HMVEC-L cells (Fig. 4B). EXEL-2880 potently
inhibited this response to tumor cell–derived growth factors with
IC50 values of 4 to 5 nmol/L. Additionally, EXEL-2880 showed little
cytotoxicity in endothelial cells (IC50, 2,180 nmol/L), indicating that
the effects of EXEL-2880 in this cell culture system are clearly
antiangiogenic rather than cytotoxic.
A second assay was used to test EXEL-2880 for activity against
endothelial cell migration. A cell-free zone was scratched into a
monolayer of HMVEC-L cells, and the ability of EXEL-2880 to block
VEGF- or HGF-stimulated migration of these cells into the cell-free
zone was determined. Figure 4C and D show that, in the presence of
HGF or VEGF, migration of HMVEC-L cells was nearly complete.
Moreover, EXEL-2880 reduced migration of HMVEC-L cells in response
to HGF and VEGF with IC50 values of 17 and 5 nmol/L, respectively.
Cytotoxicity screening panel. To determine the cytotoxic
activity of EXEL-2880, a broad panel of cell lines was screened by
microarray analysis. These experiments were conducted in the
absence of HGF and thus represent activity only where Met is
endogenously activated. Overall, the extent of cytotoxic activity
generally correlated with high-level expression of known EXEL2880 targets. Among the most sensitive cell lines, 73% (8 of 11) had
extremely high levels of at least one target gene (Supplementary
Fig. S2), with gastric tumors exhibiting the highest proportion of
sensitive cell lines (50%, 3 of 6). Two of the sensitive gastric cell lines,
Hs746T and SNU-5, have both DNA amplification and overexpression of Met. Additional data are available in Supplementary Data.
In vivo inhibition of Met and Flk-1/KDR by EXEL-2880. A
single 100 mg/kg oral gavage dose of EXEL-2880 resulted in substantial inhibition of phosphorylation of B16F10 tumor Met, which
persisted through 24 h (Fig. 5A). In separate experiments, a single
oral dose of EXEL-2880 inhibited ligand (e.g., HGF or VEGF)–induced
receptor phosphorylation of Met in liver and Flk-1/KDR in lung
through 24 h.

EXEL-2880 Inhibits HGF and VEGF Receptor Tyrosine Kinases

The potent and long-lasting pharmacodynamic activity of EXEL2880 in B16F10 solid tumors prompted efficacy studies in this same
model although under different experimental conditions. As shown
in Fig. 5B, i.v. implantation of B16F10 cells leads to accumulation of
tumor cells in the lung where they implant and grow as malignant
nodules resembling a model of lung metastasis (45). Once daily oral
gavage administration of EXEL-2880 resulted in a dose-dependent
reduction in tumor burden of 31% and 62%, respectively, for doses
of 30 and 100 mg/kg as determined by a reduction in lung wet
weights (Fig. 5B). This reduction in lung wet weight was consistent
with reductions in both the average size and the number of surface
nodules in the lung. The lung surface tumor burden, calculated by
multiplying the total nodule count by the average nodule diameter
for each tumor, was reduced by 50% and 58% following treatment with 30 and 100 mg/kg EXEL-2880, respectively. In contrast,
animals in the vehicle-treated control group exhibited a significant
2-fold increase in lung wet weight compared with animals treated
with mock implantation (Supplementary Table S4). In a similar
manner, EXEL-2880 treatment of mice bearing B16F10 solid tumors
also resulted in dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition of 64%
and 87% at 30 and 100 mg/kg, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3).
For both studies, administration of EXEL-2880 was well tolerated
with no significant body weight loss.

Discussion
Dysregulation of Met activity has been extensively described in
numerous forms of human malignancy and is associated with
an aggressive, metastatic phenotype. Multiple point mutations
in c-Met have also been documented in tumors including lung,

ovarian, and hepatocellular carcinomas. Activating mutations are
found in the kinase domain, juxtamembrane domain, and extracellular domain, and mutant forms of c-Met transform cells in
culture and promote tumor formation in mice. As documented for
other RTKs, many of the point mutations in c-Met found in human
tumors are somatic; however, c-Met activating mutations have also
been documented in the germ-line. People who inherit activating
point mutations in the c-Met kinase domain inevitably develop
renal cancer, a syndrome known as hereditary papillary renal cell
carcinoma. The pivotal role of VEGF and its receptors in promoting
angiogenesis is also well established, and both antibody and smallmolecule inhibitors of VEGF signaling have shown utility in the
clinic. Rapid up-regulation of both VEGF and Met occurs in tumor
cells under hypoxic conditions, and VEGF signaling synergizes with
HGF to promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, and invasion. Thus,
dual inhibition of Met and VEGF receptors may inhibit growth
and survival mechanisms activated by tumor cells in response to
hypoxic stress and may be particularly effective in addressing the
most lethal aspects of tumor growth, such as migration, invasion,
and metastasis. Using this rationale, EXEL-2880 was optimized as a
dual inhibitor of Met and KDR RTKs.
Although it was optimized for inhibition of Met and KDR,
EXEL-2880 also displays nanomolar potency toward Ron (a close
homologue of Met), other VEGF receptors (Flt-1 and Flt-4), c-KIT,
platelet-derived growth factor receptors, and Tie-2. This spectrumselective activity may be advantageous in mediating the antiangiogenic effects of the compound. For example, it has been shown that
combined inhibition of both VEGF and platelet-derived growth
factor receptors elicits more profound antivascular activity than
inhibition of either receptor alone likely due to direct effects on

B16F10 cells were seeded onto 0.8 Am
porous membranes and treated with
EXEL-2880 in the presence or absence of
HGF (50 ng/mL) for 24 h, and inhibition of
migration relative to HGF-alone treated
cells was done. D, Matrigel was coated onto
0.8 Am porous membranes followed by
seeding of B16F10 cells treated with
EXEL-2880 in the presence or absence of
ligand HGF (50 ng/mL) for 24 h, and the
inhibition of invasion relative to HGF
alone–treated cells was determined.

vascular endothelial cells and indirect effects on the perivascular
structure (45).
The binding of EXEL-2880 to both Met and VEGF receptor is
characterized by a very slow off-rate in vitro. X-ray crystallography
revealed that the compound is tightly bound in the active site of
Met, with the activation loop burying the compound and sequestering it from solvent. The structure of Met in complex with
EXEL-2880 exhibits some unique features compared with the five
complexes of Met bound to small-molecule inhibitors (46–48) and
two Apo structures (48, 49) that have been reported previously. The
inhibitors SU11274, AM7, and K252A all bind to an inactive conformation of Met that closely resembles the Apo unphosphorylated
structures, although some differences are observed in the activation loop conformations. In contrast, EXEL-2880 dislodges Phe1223
from its binding pocket in the Apo conformation and causes reorganization of the activation loop, such that Phe1223 stacks with the
fluorophenyl ring of the inhibitor. In contrast to the Apo structure,

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (20). October 15, 2009

the C-helix is localized close to the N-lobe, the conserved kinase salt
bridge is formed, and the C-helix and salt bridge forms interactions
with the inhibitor. Two additional Met inhibitors also have this ‘‘Pheout’’ conformation for the activation loop as well as a C-helix that is
positioned close to the N-lobe, interacting with the bound inhibitor
(46). However, in these structures, the conserved salt bridge is not
formed; instead, Glu1127 forms a hydrogen bond with the inhibitor.
Consistent with its potent and durable inhibition of Met kinase
activity in vitro, EXEL-2880 is a potent inhibitor of Met phosphorylation in tumor cells and of Met-driven tumor cell responses
as evident from the inhibition of both attached and anchorageindependent cell growth and the particularly high sensitivity of
c-Met-amplified gastric cancer cell lines. EXEL-2880 also inhibits
HGF-driven migration and invasion of B16F10 cells with IC50 values
similar to those found for receptor phosphorylation. Furthermore,
EXEL-2880 inhibits VEGF signaling in endothelial cells and is also a
potent inhibitor of endothelial cell migration and tubule formation.

EXEL-2880 Inhibits HGF and VEGF Receptor Tyrosine Kinases

Of note, HMVEC-L migration was inhibited to a similar extent in
response to either VEGF or HGF stimulation, consistent with the
multitargeted profile of EXEL-2880. EXEL-2880 also blocked in vitro
endothelial tube formation in response to either VEGF or
conditioned medium from tumor cells, suggesting that the array of
growth factors secreted by these tumor cells cannot circumvent the
antivascular effects of EXEL-2880. Thus, this unique combination of
in vitro activities, affecting both tumor and endothelial cells, enables
a single molecule to reverse three of the six so-called hallmarks of
cancer: proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion/metastasis.
Single-dose oral administration of EXEL-2880 resulted in prolonged inhibition of phosphorylation of constitutively phosphorylated Met in B16F10 solid tumors as well as ligand HGF-stimulated
phosphorylation of Met in whole liver. Similar potent activity was

observed for inhibition of VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of
Flk-1/KDR in whole lung. This pharmacodynamic activity correlated well with potent efficacy in the B16F10 mouse model of lung
metastasis. Oral administration of EXEL-2880 at well-tolerated
doses produced a robust, dose-dependent reduction in both the
size and the number of lung nodules. In addition, EXEL-2880
treatment resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of B16F10 solid
tumors. Collectively, these studies suggest that EXEL-2880 has
significant utility in treating primary solid tumors and furthermore
may both prevent implantation of metastatic cells and limit the
invasive growth of established metastatic lesions, thus affecting
perhaps the most lethal phenotype of tumor cells in vivo.
Overall, these data show that EXEL-2880 is a highly potent and
tight-binding inhibitor of Met and KDR tyrosine kinases and that

Figure 5. EXEL-2880 inhibits phosphorylation of Met and
Flk-1/KDR and reduces tumor burden in an experimental
model of lung metastasis. A, naive mice or mice bearing
B16F10 tumors were administered a single oral gavage
dose of EXEL-2880 (100 mg/kg) or vehicle before
i.v. administration of HGF (10 Ag/mouse) or VEGF
(10 Ag/mouse). Tissues (tumor, liver, and lung) were
collected and lysates were prepared. The relative percent
inhibition of phosphorylation of Met and Flk-1/KDR was
compared with tissue lysates from vehicle-treated control
animals collected at the same time point. B, B16F10 cells
were implanted into mice via i.v. tail vein injection, and
3 d later, oral gavage administration of EXEL-2880
(30 and 100 mg/kg/d) or vehicle was initiated for 10 d.
Lungs were harvested and tumor burden was assessed.

this activity profile elicits antitumor effects on both tumor
epithelial cells and vasculature. This combination of activities
translates into broad and potent inhibition of tumor growth
