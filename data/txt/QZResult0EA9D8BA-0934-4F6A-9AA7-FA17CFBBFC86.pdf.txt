Abstract
The pathogenic impact of tumor-inﬁltrating B cells is unresolved at present, however, some studies suggest that
they may have immune regulatory potential. Here, we report that the microenvironment of various solid tumors
includes B cells that express granzyme B (GrB, GZMB), where these B cells can be found adjacent to interleukin
(IL)-21–secreting regulatory T cells (Treg) that contribute to immune tolerance of tumor antigens. Because
Tregs and plasmacytoid dendritic cells are known to modulate T-effector cells by a GrB-dependent mechanism,
we hypothesized that a similar process may operate to modulate regulatory B cells (Breg). IL-21 induced
outgrowth of B cells expressing high levels of GrB, which thereby limited T-cell proliferation by a GrB-dependent
degradation of the T-cell receptor z-chain. Mechanistic investigations into how IL-21 induced GrB expression in B
cells to confer Breg function revealed a CD19þCD38þCD1dþIgMþCD147þ expression signature, along with
expression of additional key regulatory molecules including IL-10, CD25, and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase.
Notably, induction of GrB by IL-21 integrated signals mediated by surface immunoglobulin M (B-cell receptor)
and Toll-like receptors, each of which were enhanced with expression of the B-cell marker CD5. Our ﬁndings
show for the ﬁrst time that IL-21 induces GrBþ human Bregs. They also establish the existence of human B
cells with a regulatory phenotype in solid tumor inﬁltrates, where they may contribute to the suppression of
antitumor immune responses. Together, these ﬁndings may stimulate novel diagnostic and cell therapeutic
approaches to better manage human cancer as well as autoimmune and graft-versus-host pathologies. Cancer Res;

diseases (1, 2). In murine autoimmune models, adoptive Bcell transfer can ameliorate chronic inﬂammatory responses
even when the disease is already established (1, 3). Similarly,
in human patients with rheumatoid arthritis, disease activity
is lower in patients with high peripheral B-cell counts (4).
One of the factors produced by regulatory B cells (Breg) is
the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-10, which
has recently been identiﬁed in mouse models (1, 5–7) and
humans (1, 2, 8, 9). Nevertheless, although some clinical
observations clearly support the concept of human B cells
contributing to the limitation of autoimmune diseases, in
other cases they are known to have rather aggravating
potential (10). To better understand the development of
regulatory versus pathogenic B cells, a more comprehensive
knowledge of factors inducing and mediating Breg functions
is necessary.
A previously discovered cytokine with pleiotropic effects on
a variety of immune cells is IL-21 (11). The effects of IL-21 on B
cells strongly depend on additional signals including Toll-like
receptors (TLR) agonists, B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation
and CD40 ligation (12). Recently, CD40 ligand (CD40L) was
shown to determine whether IL-21 induces differentiation of B
cells into plasma cells (13, 14), or, in its absence, into B cells
secreting the serine protease granzyme B (GrB; refs. 15, 16).

Granzyme Bþ Regulatory B Cells Inﬁltrate Tumors

Importantly, GrB is characterized not only by its classical
function as cytotoxic protease, but also exhibits immunosuppressive properties such as in regulatory T cells (Treg; refs. 17–
19) and dendritic cells (20). In line with these ﬁndings, IL-21 has
been described to mediate expression of IL-10 by murine
cytotoxic cells and B cells (21, 22), supporting its involvement
in immune regulation.
Several inﬂammatory conditions including systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) and acute viral infections are characterized by both elevated GrB (23, 24) and IL-21 serum levels
(15, 25, 26). Moreover, we recently showed that GrBþ B cells can
be found in patients with SLE (15) and in subjects vaccinated
against viral infections (16). An association of GrBþ B cells with
solid tumors has not been reported so far. However, while
inﬁltration of certain tumors with B cells can be associated
with a good prognosis (27–30), in others the presence of B cells
support a tumor-protective environment (31–33). We therefore hypothesized that GrB-expressing B cells may phenotypically represent Breg and may be present in the microenvironment of human tumors.
In the current work, we show that IL-21 induces a regulatory
phenotype in human B cells with expression of immunoregulatory molecules including GrB, IL-10, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and CD25. Moreover, we show that GrBþ B cells
suppress T-cell proliferation by GrB-dependent degradation
of the T-cell receptor (TCR) z-chain, a known GrB substrate
(34). Importantly, we show that GrBþ B cells as well as IL-21–
providing T cells are present in the tumor microenvironment
of certain solid tumors. Of note, CD5þ B cells from human
cord blood possess an enhanced capacity to express GrB,
supporting the concept that CD5þ B cells may play a particular
role in immune regulation, as suggested by various mouse
models (5–7).
In summary, our ﬁndings suggest IL-21 is a key cytokine
for the generation of human Bregs under certain environmental contexts, and GrB represents a central immunomodulatory
molecule expressed by such Breg. GrBþ Breg may play a so far
unappreciated role in human pathologies by inﬁltration of
tumors or by modulation of inﬂammatory processes. Our study
also suggests IL-21–induced Breg may prove useful as innovative cell-therapeutic tool for the management of undesired
immune activation in autoimmune diseases and GVHD.

Materials and Methods
Human subjects and cell culture
The use of blood from human subjects was approved by the
Ethics Committee at Ulm University (Ulm, Germany). Blood
samples were collected after informed consent had been given.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or mononuclear
cells from umbilical cord blood (cord blood mononuclear cells)
were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. CD19þ
B cells (>99% purity) and CD4þ T cells (>95% purity) were
magnetically puriﬁed using appropriate negative selection kits
according to the manufacturer's protocol (Miltenyi Biotec).
Cells were suspended in AIM-V medium (Gibco BRL) and
incubated on U-bottom 96-well plates at 1  106 cells/mL and
200 mL/well, if not stated otherwise. For B-cell/T-cell coculture

experiments, CD4þ T cells were added to CD19þ B cells at a 1:1
ratio and incubated for the time indicated. Reagents used for
functional assays are outlined in the article Supplementary
Data.
Reagents for functional assays
For BCR stimulation, afﬁnity puriﬁed rabbit F (ab0 )2 against
human IgAþIgGþIgM (HþL) was used at 6.5 mg/mL
(anti-BCR, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Human
recombinant IL-21 (50 ng/mL) was purchased from BioSource.
Human recombinant IL-2 (100 IU/mL) was obtained from
PeproTech GmbH. CpG ODN 2243 was obtained from
Coley Pharmaceutical Group. IRS 661 and IRS 869 were purchased from Biomers. Cycloheximide and brefeldin A (both at
1 mg/mL) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Tick-borne encephalitis
virus (TBEV) antigens were used as inactivated TBEV vaccine
(standard concentration 100 ng/mL, strain Neud€
orﬂ) adsorbed
to 0.35 mg Al (OH)3 (FSME-IMMUN Erwachsene; Baxter).
For TCR stimulation, anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-coated beads
(0.02 mL/200 mL-well) from Dynal (Invitrogen) were used.
For GrB inhibition, GrB inhibitor IV (Ac-IEPD-CHO) at
5 mmol/L (American Peptide Company) or a carrier- and
preservative-free goat anti-human GrB polyclonal antibody
[immunoglobulin G (IgG)] at 10 mg/mL (R&D Systems) was
used.
Flow cytometry
Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-, phycoerythrin (PE)-, PECy5-, PE-Cy7-, or allophycocyanine (APC)-labeled antibodies to
CD1d, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD19, CD20, CD25, CD27, CD38, CD58,
CD69, CD70, CD86, CD107a, IgD, and IgM were purchased from
BD Biosciences. FITC-labeled antibodies to CD10 and PElabeled antibodies to CD24 were purchased from EXBIO,
FITC-labeled antibodies to CD58, CD147, Annexin V, and
PE-labeled antibodies to IL-10 from Immunotools, FITClabeled antibodies to CD154 from BioLegend, Alexa Fluor
488–labeled antibodies to human IDO from R&D Systems,
carboxyﬂuorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) from SigmaAldrich, and PE- and APC-labeled antibodies to human GrB
(clone GB12) from Invitrogen. Appropriate isotype controls
were used. For intracellular GrB, IL-10, and IDO staining, cells
were incubated with brefeldin A (1 mg/mL) during the last 4
hours of incubation and analyzed as recently described (16).
For apoptosis detection, cells were stained with Annexin V
for 15 minutes at room temperature. Then, propidium iodide
(PI; 1 mg/mL) was added and samples immediately analyzed
by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Flow-cytometric analyses were conducted on a FACScan or a FACSCalibur (BD Immunocytometry Systems). Data were analyzed using FlowJo (version 9.3.1; Tree Star).
CFSE staining and proliferation assay
For proliferation experiments, 1  107 cells puriﬁed CD4þ T
cells were resuspended in 10 mL PBS containing 0.1% bovine
serum albumin (PBS/BSA). CFSE was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mmol/L and cells were incubated at 37 C for 10
minutes. Incubation was stopped by adding 40 mL ice-cold
culture medium and suspension was incubated for 5 minutes

on ice before 3 additional washing steps with PBS/BSA. Then,
CD4þ T cells were cocultured for 6 days with autologous or
allogenic puriﬁed B cells in the presence of anti-CD3/28 beads,
IL-2, IL-21, anti-BCR, GrB inhibitors, or combinations of these
as indicated. After 3 days of culture, 100 mL medium was
exchanged.
GrB ELISpot
Human GrB ELISpot kits were purchased from Gene-Probe
Diaclone SAS and polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF)-bottomed
96-well plates from Millipore. ELISpot assays were conducted
as recently described (15). Brieﬂy, cells were plated in AIM-V
medium at 1  105 per 100 mL per well for 16 hours. Then, plates
were developed, read on an Immunospot Series 1 Analyzer and
spots counted using Immunospot 3 software (CTL Cellular
Technology Ltd.).
ELISA for enzymatically active GrB
For the detection of enzymatically active, secreted GrB in the
supernatants of stimulated B cells, we used a highly speciﬁc
GrB activity assay according to the manufacturer's protocol
(SensiZyme; Sigma-Aldrich).
Spinning disk confocal microscopy
Puriﬁed CD19þ B cells were cultured for 16 hours in the
presence of IL-21 and anti-BCR. Puriﬁed CD4þ T cells at 1  106
cells/mL were cultured separately in the presence of anti-CD3/
28 beads. Then, 1  105 T cells were harvested, put on ibiTreat
chamber slides (ibidi GmbH) for 30 minutes for immobilization, stained with Cell Mask deep red membrane dye (Invitrogen) at 5 mg/mL for 15 minutes at 37 C and washed 3 times
with PBS. A total of 1  105 B cells in 50 mL of PBS and 25 mL of
GranToxiLux ﬂuorogenic GrB substrate (OncoImmunin) were
added. Fluorescence images were acquired using a spinning
disk confocal microscope and the acquisition software Andor
iQ 1.6 as described previously (20).
Western immunoblotting
Puriﬁed B cells (>99%) from healthy individuals were stimulated with anti-BCR  IL-21 overnight. Autologous puriﬁed
CD4þ T cells (>98%) were simultaneously stimulated with antiCD3/28 beads in a separate culture. After removal of beads and
treatment with 1 mg/mL cycloheximide, CD4þ T cells were
cocultured at a 1:1 ratio with prestimulated B cells for 24 hours
in the presence or absence of anti-GrB antibodies. Then,
cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mmol/L HEPES,
10 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L KH2PO4, 5 mmol/L NaHCO3,
1 mmol/L CaCl2, 0.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 5 mmol/L EDTA in A.
dest.) containing a protease inhibitor (protease inhibitor cocktail set III; Calbiochem) for 15 minutes on ice. Protein content
was measured using Pierce BCA colorimetric protein assay kit
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). Then, proteins were separated on 18%
SDS-PAGE and transferred onto 0.45-mm PVDF membranes.
After washing and blocking, membranes were incubated with
primary monoclonal antibodies against human TCR-z (16
hours, 4 C; Biolegend) or b-actin (30 minutes, room temperature; Thermo Scientiﬁc). Then, membranes were washed 3
times and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase–conjugat-

ed secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) for 1 hour at room temperature. Finally, membranes were developed and band intensities quantiﬁed using
ImageJ.
Cytometric bead array
For quantiﬁcation of IL-2, supernatants from B cells and T
cells cocultured at a 1:1 ratio for 3 days were analyzed using a
BioPlex-9 Plex Cytokine Assay Kit (BioRad Laboratories)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. All incubations
were conducted at room temperature. Brieﬂy, the anti-cytokine bead solution was diluted and 50 mL were placed on 96well Durapore membrane plates (Millipore). After washing by
vacuum ﬁltration, 50 mL of undiluted supernatants and standards were placed into wells and incubated for 30 minutes on a
shaker. After washing, 25 mL detection antibody was added and
incubated for another 30 minutes while shaking. After washing,
streptavidin–PE was added for 10 minutes. Finally, plates were
washed, resuspended in assay buffer and read on a ﬂow
cytometer (Luminex). Data were analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager software (Bio-Rad).
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
Formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded cancer tissue sections (1
mm) from various solid epithelial cancers including breast,
cervical, ovarian, colorectal, and prostate carcinomas were
obtained from the local department of pathology (Table 1). In
compliance with the German law for correct usage of archival
tissue for clinical research the blocks were anonymized. Double immunoﬂuorescent staining of formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded cancer tissue sections against GrB, IL-21, or IL-10
as ﬁrst antigens and against CD19 or CD3 as second antigens
was conducted as follows: tissue sections were deparafﬁnized
in xylol and alcohol and antigens retrieved by 20-minute
incubation in 10 mmol/L citric acid (pH 6.0) in a pressure
cooker. Then, sections were incubated with primary antibodies
against GrB (mouse anti-human GrB; Dako Cytomation), IL-21
(rabbit anti-human IL-21; Acris Antibodies), or IL-10 (rabbit
anti-human IL-10; Acris Antibodies) for 30 minutes in a moist
chamber and rinsed with PBS. Subsequently, sections were
incubated with secondary biotinylated antibodies (anti-mouse
or anti-rabbit; Dako Cytomation) for 30 minutes. For GrB and
IL-21 staining, this was followed by a 30-minute incubation
with a streptavidin–Alexa Fluor 488–conjugate (Molecular
Probes), for IL-10 staining with a DyLight 488–conjugated
anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Dianova). To enable double
immunohistochemisty with antibodies from the same host as
used for the ﬁrst antigen, sections were placed on a heating
plate for 4 minutes at 90 C in H2O to denature open binding
sites on the primary antibodies. Then, slides were incubated
with primary mouse anti-human CD19 or CD3 antibodies
(Dako Cytomation) for 30 minutes, followed by incubation
with a Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Dianova) for 30
minutes. Internal controls included exclusion of nonspeciﬁc
binding of Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies as well as
premature denaturation of antibody binding sites by placing
the heating step directly after binding of the primary anti-GrB
and anti-IL-21 antibodies, respectively. In this case, no binding

(Fig. 1C and D). B cells stimulated with IL-21 alone had a
mild suppressive effect only, corresponding with a lower
expression of GrB (Fig. 1C and D). Both a GrB-neutralizing
antibody and a speciﬁc GrB substrate inhibitor were able to
rescue T-cell proliferation (Fig. 1E and F). The lower proliferation of T cells in the presence of BCR-stimulated B cells
is due to enhanced consumption of media with anti-BCR–
induced B-cell proliferation.

CD19 PE-Cy7

Because expression of GrB by B cells is not accompanied by
perforin expression, they may exhibit perforin-independent
functions (23), such as the immunosuppressive capacity of
Treg (17–19). To test the hypothesis that GrBþ B cells may
exhibit similar functions, we isolated B cells and preactivated them with IL-21 and BCR stimulation. IL-21 rapidly
induced expression and secretion of enzymatically active
GrB in a number of B cells, an effect strongly enhanced by
simultaneous BCR stimulation (Fig. 1A and B and Supplementary Fig. S1). We then isolated CD4þ T cells and induced
proliferation using by activating CD3 and CD28 (CD3/CD28).
Subsequently, we incubated CD3/CD28–stimulated T cells
for 6 days in the presence or absence of differentially
activated B cells. T-cell proliferation was strongly suppressed in the presence of IL-21/anti-BCR–activated B cells,
but not in the absence of B cells (Supplementary Fig. S2) or
in the presence of unstimulated or IL-2–stimulated B cells

Inhibition of T-cell proliferation by B cells involves
transfer of active GrB to T cells and degradation of the
T-cell receptor z-chain but not induction of T-cell
apoptosis
Next, we characterized the underlying interactions between
GrBþ B cells and T cells. First, we tested whether B cell–derived
GrB is delivered to T cells in its active form. To this end,
we preincubated B cells with or without IL-21 and anti-BCR

Figure 2. B cells transfer active GrB to T cells and induce GrB-dependent degradation of the TCR z-chain. A, healthy B cells were isolated and activated using
þ
IL-21 and anti-BCR overnight. In parallel, CD4 T cells were isolated and separately cultured with anti-CD3/CD28 beads. Then, T cells were stained with Cell
Mask deep red membrane dye and cocultured with B cells on a chamber slide. GrB-speciﬁc ﬂuorogenic substrate was added for cellular detection
of active GrB and live cell imaging conducted for 6 hours. Shown are 9 video frames at different time points. Images are from 1 representative
experiment out of 3 with similar results. B, puriﬁed B cells from healthy individuals were stimulated with anti-BCR  IL-21 overnight. Autologous
puriﬁed CD4þ T cells were simultaneously stimulated with anti-CD3/28 beads in a separate culture. After removal of beads and treatment with 1 mg/mL
cycloheximide, CD4þ T cells were cocultured at a 1:1 ratio with prestimulated B cells for 24 hours in the presence or absence of anti-GrB antibodies.
Then, cells were lysed, protein contents of samples equalized, and TCR-z protein determined by Western blot analysis. b-Actin was used as control.
One representative experiment out of 5 with similar results is shown. Control cultures with T cells and B cells cultured separately showed no change in TCR-z
protein levels (data not shown). C, relative band intensities of TCR-z and b-actin were determined using ImageJ and ratios were calculated. Bar graphs show
the ratios between TCR-z and b-actin band intensities.

and then started coincubating them with CD4þ T cells in
the presence of a GrB-speciﬁc ﬂuorogenic substrate on microscopy dishes. Spinning disk confocal microscopy showed that
after 2 to 3 hours T cells began to internalize B cell–derived GrB
into the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Video S1). No
active GrB was observed in T cells in the presence of unstimulated, GrB B cells (data not shown).
A potential impact of GrB on T cells may be induction of
apoptosis by caspase cleavage. Nevertheless, using FACS
analysis, we excluded that B cells stimulated in the presence
of IL-21  anti-BCR were able to induce signiﬁcant T-cell
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). A more recently identiﬁed GrB substrate is the z-chain of the TCR (TCR-z),
which plays a role in delivering activation and growth signals
to T cells (34). To test the impact of B cell–derived GrB on
TCR-z, we coincubated CD3/CD28–activated CD4þ T cells in
the presence or absence of B cells activated with IL-21 
anti-BCR. B cells stimulated with IL-21 and anti-BCR, but
not B cells stimulated with anti-BCR only, were able to
strongly suppress TCR-z expression in coincubated CD4þ
T cells (Fig. 2B and C). This effect was not seen in the

www.aacrjournals.org

absence of B cells (data not shown). More importantly,
TCR-z expression in T cells was partly rescued by a GrBneutralizing antibody (Fig. 2B and C).
GrB expression by IL-21–stimulated B cells is part of a
regulatory B cell phenotype
As outlined earlier, we primarily described IL-21–induced
Breg as cells able to express and secrete GrB (Fig. 1), a capacity
they seem to share with Tregs (17–19) and regulatory dendritic
cells (20). To deﬁne in more detail the phenotype of IL-21–
induced GrBþ B cells, we tested a variety of surface antigens
described in the past to characterize Breg (5, 6, 8, 9, 35). These
antigens include activation markers, molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily, costimulatory molecules, enzymes,
and adhesion molecules. We found signiﬁcant upregulation
of several of these molecules in IL-21–stimulated GrBþ B cells
including CD38, CD1d, IgM, CD86, CD154, CD10, and CD20
(Fig. 3). CD70 showed a higher expression in GrBþ B cells as
compared with unstimulated B cells, whereas CD24, CD27,
and IgD exhibited no increase or even a decrease in GrBþ B
cells (Fig. 3).

Figure 3. GrB B cells develop a
Breg surface phenotype. Healthy
PBMC were analyzed before or
after culture with IL-21 and antiBCR for 4 days. Cells were
harvested, stained for CD19 and
various surface markers, ﬁxed,
permeabilized, intracellularly
stained for GrB, and analyzed by
FACS. Bar graphs show average
MFIs from 3 or more individual
experiments; dashed lines indicate
average isotype controls.

A frequently reported characteristic of Breg is the expression of IL-10, with such B cells often referred to as B10 cells
(2, 5, 6). Here, we show that healthy peripheral B cells
stimulated with IL-21/anti-BCR also responded with the
development of a small but signiﬁcant population of B cells
expressing IL-10 (Fig. 4A and B). This population did not
occur in the presence of IL-2 nor in the absence of cytokines.
Moreover, costimulation of B cells with IL-21/anti-BCR was
able to induce IDO, another regulatory molecule previously
described in dendritic cells (36). Again, this effect was small
but signiﬁcant, and most pronounced in the presence of
IL-21, but not with IL-2 or without cytokines (Fig. 4C and D).
Importantly, after stimulation of B cells with IL-21 and antiBCR, GrB not only was the ﬁrst regulatory molecule expressed (Fig. 1), but all additional regulatory molecules tested
were primarily expressed on GrBþ but not on GrB B cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
Because IL-21–activated GrBþ B cells seem to express
characteristic Breg markers, we also tested Treg-speciﬁc antigens. Tregs typically express high levels of CD25 and it was
hypothesized that part of their inhibitory effect is effector
T-cell deprivation of IL-2 (37, 38). IL-21–stimulated B cells
indeed signiﬁcantly upregulated surface CD25 (Fig. 4E and F),
and were able to capture free IL-2 from T cell/B cell cocultures
(Fig. 4G). Nevertheless, we were not able to rescue the proliferative response of cocultured T cells by retitrating recombinant IL-2 (Supplementary Fig. S5), indicating that IL-2 deprivation may not be the primary mechanism exhibited by
human Breg. Finally, IL-21–activated B cells expressed
increased levels of the Treg-speciﬁc Ig family member CD147
(ref. 39; Fig. 3), whereas neither Foxp3 nor CTLA-4 or CD28
were expressed by IL-21–stimulated B cells (data not shown).

CD5þ B cells exhibit an enhanced potential to express
GrB as compared with CD5 B cells
CD5 is another marker described on murine Breg (5, 6),
although it is not expressed on IL-21–induced GrBþ peripheral
B cells (data not shown). Recently, however, we found that
CD5þ B cells from patients with SLE constitutively express GrB,
in contrast to CD5 B cells from normal healthy donors (15). To
directly compare the GrB potential of CD5þ versus CD5 B
cells, we isolated B cells from cord blood samples and from
adult healthy donors. We found that the GrB response of CD5þ
B cells to IL-21 was more than 2-fold stronger than the
response of CD5 B cells from healthy adult donors (Fig.
5A–C). Moreover, we previously showed that B cells from
healthy volunteers vaccinated against viral infections such as
TBEV respond with stronger GrB expression to IL-21 stimulation than B cells from unvaccinated donors (16). Therefore,
we compared the GrB response of CD5þ and CD5 B cells from
normal donors to IL-21 in the presence of TBEV vaccines
instead of anti-BCR. Here, the GrB response of CD5þ B cells was
up to 10-fold stronger (Fig. 5D and E), suggesting an innate
potential of CD5þ B cells to express GrB in the presence of
danger signals such as viral stimuli.
IL-21–induced GrB expression by B cells depends on both
BCR and TLR signaling pathways
IL-21–induced GrB expression by peripheral B cells is
strongly enhanced in the presence of BCR stimulation, an
effect suppressed by SYK inhibition (16). However, the
induction of GrB in antigen-unexperienced CD5þ B cells by
viral antigens (Fig. 5D and E) suggests the additional involvement of TLR such as TLR7 or TLR9. Indeed, we found that
inhibition of both TLR7 and TLR9 using speciﬁc inhibitory

ODN (40) suppressed IL-21–induced GrB expression in B
cells in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was found in
both CD5 and CD5þ B cells (Supplementary Fig. S6).
GrB-expressing B cells and IL-21–expressing T cells
reside in the microenvironment of various solid tumors
Although the regulation of immunity is important, its
suppression may be undesired when the establishment of
a robust immune response, for example against a tumor, is
required. To evaluate whether B cells with a regulatory
phenotype could play a role in the modulation of antitumor
immune responses, we screened a variety of tumor tissue
sections for GrBþ B cells. We found that GrB-expressing B

cells reside within the microenvironment of different tumor
types including breast, ovarian, cervical, colorectal, and
prostate carcinomas (Fig. 6A–F and Table 1). Because we
identiﬁed IL-21 as key cytokine for differentiation of B
cells into GrBþ B cells, we tested whether IL-21–expressing
cells are also present in the tumor tissue. As expected, IL21–expressing CD3þ T cells could be identiﬁed in the vicinity
of B cells in these tissue sections (Fig. 6G and H). Importantly, we also detected IL-10–expressing CD19þ B cells in
the same tumor tissues that contained GrBþ B cells, suggesting that B cells with a regulatory phenotype in this tumor
micorenvironment may express both IL-10 and GrB (Supplementary Fig. S7). Nonetheless, the frequency of IL-10þ B

showing that the predominant regulatory molecule
expressed by IL-21–induced human Breg is GrB (Supplementary Fig. S4).

Discussion
B cell–mediated immune regulation seems to be a fundamental property of the immune system (1, 2). In the present
study, we identiﬁed IL-21 as key cytokine for the induction of
human Bregs. Their phenotype includes surface markers such
as CD1d, CD38, IgM, CD10, CD86, and CD154 (5, 6, 8, 9, 35) but
also molecules with actual regulatory functions including GrB
(17–20), IL-10 (2, 5, 6), IDO (36), and CD25 (37, 38). IL-21 is

2476

known to have a variety of effects on B cells, depending on their
maturation stage and the presence of further costimulatory
signals. In certain cases, IL-21 can induce B-cell proliferation,
survival, differentiation into plasma cells, or isotype switching
(13, 14). In other situations, B cells rather undergo apoptosis
and cell-cycle arrest after IL-21 stimulation (41). Recently,
CD154 (CD40L) was identiﬁed as important determinant
for IL-21–induced differentiation of human B cells into either
plasma cells (13, 14) or into GrB-secreting B lymphocytes
(15, 16). Here, we show that human B cells gain regulatory
potential in response to IL-21, provided additional triggering
of the BCR and TLRs is present. Although their involvement
in the development of human Breg has been proposed before
(1, 42), a speciﬁc role of IL-21 in this regard has not been
considered so far.

The exact phenotype of Breg is not clearly deﬁned and
multiple discrepancies exist between different studies (1, 2).
A common ﬁnding in mice seems to be IL-10 secretion and
expression of CD1d and CD5 (5–7). These data were only partly
conﬁrmed in humans (8, 9). A recent study described a human
CD19þCD24hiCD38hi B-cell population with regulatory potential, which is functionally impaired in patients with SLE (8).
This B-cell population secreted IL-10 but did not express CD5.
Of note, its regulatory capacity was dependent on CD86
expression, but only partially on IL-10 secretion, so that the
authors postulated the existence of further soluble factors with
regulatory potential. These results are complementary to our
data showing that CD86 is strongly upregulated in IL-21–
activated Breg and that the Breg identiﬁed in our study secrete
several additional regulatory molecules. One of these molecules is CD25, which is also expressed on Treg (37, 38). A recent
study showed the development of large, CD25þ B cells with
regulatory potential after polyclonal activation with different
TLR-agonistic stimuli (43). Part of the regulatory effect identiﬁed in CD25-expressing B cells may therefore be due to IL-2
deprivation (37, 38). We further identiﬁed CD147 to be upregulated by IL-21-induced Breg, an immunoglobulin family
member that was recently postulated as novel marker for
highly active CD4þCD25þFoxP3þ Treg (39). Although further
molecules typically associated with Treg, including CTLA-4
and Foxp3, were not expressed by IL-21–induced Breg, the
panel of regulatory molecules compiled in this study including

Figure 6. GrB B cells and IL-21–providing T cells inﬁltrate
the microenvironment of solid tumors. A–F, double
immunohistochemistry (60-fold magniﬁcation) was conducted
on a series of formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded cancer tissue
sections from various tumors including breast (A–B), ovarian
(C–D), and cervical (E–F) carcinomas. Tumor sections were
costained with anti-CD19 antibodies (red), anti-GrB antibodies
(green), and DAPI (blue, nuclear staining). Negative control
stainings ruled out unspeciﬁc staining. G, in alternatively stained
tumor sections, IL-21–expressing cells (green) were detected
adjacent to CD19þ B cells (red). H, ﬁnally, coexpression of IL-21
and CD3 was shown by double immunohistochemistry of breast,
cervical, and ovarian carcinoma sections using anti-CD3
antibodies (red, surface staining) and anti-IL-21 antibodies
(green).

GrB, IDO, IL-10, and CD25 suggests mechanistic similarities
between GrB-expressing Breg and Treg. Given previous ﬁndings in Treg and in pDC (17–20), we hypothesize that particularly GrB may be a common effector molecule of human
regulatory cells in general. Apart from the GrB effect identiﬁed
in our study, namely TCR-z degradation, GrB may exhibit
further regulatory functions such as TGF-b release from soluble b-glycans (44) or induction of apoptosis in certain
immune cells. In IL-21–induced human Breg GrB not only is
the ﬁrst regulatory molecule expressed, but all other regulatory
molecules tested are expressed primarily on GrBþ, but not on
GrB B cells. This suggests that GrB represents a predominant
regulatory molecule and an important novel marker of human
Breg.
Although the existence of tumor-inﬁltrating B cells has been
previously described (27, 45), their signiﬁcance for solid tumors
remains unclear. For example, in ovarian cancers some publications correlate the presence of B cells in the tumor microenvironment with a better prognosis (28), whereas others state
that their presence is associated with a worse outcome (33). To
detect the "smoking gun" of B cells with a GrBþ regulatory
phenotype directly in tumor tissue, we therefore started
screening various human tumors for CD19þGrBþ cells. This
screening revealed that GrB-expressing B cells, IL-21–providing T cells, and some IL-10–expressing B cells indeed inﬁltrate
solid tumor tissue. These ﬁndings, and recent data showing
downregulation of the TCR-z chain in deﬁned solid tumors

Lindner et al.

(46), suggest IL-21–induced GrBþ B cells may indeed play
an immunosuppressive role in certain tumors, possibly with
similar impact on T-cell responses as Treg. Nevertheless,
while the presence of IL-21þ cells provides a valid explanation
for the induction of GrBþ B cells in tumor tissue, a variety of
cofactors such as CD40L, TLR ligands, and tumor-derived
danger signals may inﬂuence the function of IL-21. Moreover,
local secretion within a tumor may allow IL-21 to interact
with different cell types than its systemic occurrence. It is
therefore possible that IL-21 supports an immunosuppressive
environment within a tumor, whereas its systemic application
may allow activation of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells
with antitumor activity at tumor-distant sites, eventually even
resulting in the establishment of a robust antitumor immune
response as recently described (47). Altogether, it likely
depends on the activation status of inﬁltrating B cells, and
the presence of additional cofactors whether an efﬁcient
antitumor immune response is suppressed or supported by
inﬁltrating B cells.
In conclusion, we have shown for the ﬁrst time that IL-21 is a
key cytokine for the induction of human Breg and have
identiﬁed GrB as predominant immunomodulatory molecule
and phenotypic marker of human Breg. IL-21–mediated induction of GrB is signiﬁcantly stronger in CD5þ as compared with
CD5 B cells, and integrates both BCR- and TLR-dependent
signals. GrB plays a central role for the regulatory function of
Breg, as they can efﬁciently suppress T-cell proliferation by
GrB-dependent TCR-z degradation. GrBþ B cells exhibit a
CD19þCD38þCD1dþIgMþCD147þ phenotype and express further regulatory molecules including IL-10, CD25, and IDO.
Most importantly, GrBþ B cells can inﬁltrate the microenvironment of various solid tumors, where they are observed
adjacent to IL-21–providing T cells. Our ﬁndings strongly
suggest GrBþ B cells may contribute to the modulation of
cellular adaptive immune responses by Treg-like mechanisms,
possibly allowing the escape of certain tumors from an efﬁcient
antitumor immune response. On the other hand, the induction

and use of GrBþ Breg may be evaluated as an innovative cell
therapeutic approach to the management of immune pathologies including autoimmune diseases and GVHD.
