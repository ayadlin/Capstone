ABSTRACT
The use of dietary bioactive compounds in chemoprevention can potentially
reverse, suppress, or even prevent cancer progression. However, the effects of
licochalcone A (LicA) on apoptosis and autophagy in cervical cancer cells have not
yet been clearly elucidated. In this study, LicA treatment was found to significantly
induce the apoptotic and autophagic capacities of cervical cancer cells in vitro and
in vivo. MTT assay results showed dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity in four
cervical cancer cell lines treated with LicA. We found that LicA induced mitochondriadependent apoptosis in SiHa cells, with decreasing Bcl-2 expression. LicA also induced
autophagy effects were examined by identifying accumulation of Atg5, Atg7, Atg12 and
microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II. Treatment with autophagyspecific inhibitors (3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1) enhanced LicA-induced
apoptosis. In addition, we suggested the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of mTOR pathway by LicA. Furthermore, the inhibition
of PI3K/Akt by LY294002/si-Akt or of mTOR by rapamycin augmented LicA-induced
apoptosis and autophagy. Finally, the in vivo mice bearing a SiHa xenograft, LicA dosed
at 10 or 20 mg/kg significantly inhibited tumor growth. Our findings demonstrate the
chemotherapeutic potential of LicA for treatment of human cervical cancer.

technologies, women with cervical cancer have relatively
high five-year survival rates, and there is a consensus that
the early detection of cervical cancer can help prevent
premature mortality [2]. Although human papillomavirus
(HPV) is the major etiological agent of cervical cancer,
HPV infection alone does not sufficiently explain the
progression of cervical cancer. The suboptimal prognosis

INTRODUCTION
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer
in women, and the seventh most common type of cancer
overall, with an estimated 528,000 new cases worldwide
in 2012. There were an estimated 266,000 deaths from
cervical cancer in 2012, accounting for 7.5% of all female
cancer deaths [1]. Because of widespread screening

of patients with cervical cancer might be due to advanced
or metastatic diseases with poor responses to therapies [3].
Apoptosis is an active process in which apoptotic
cells undergo chromatin condensation and fragmentation
followed by the formation of apoptotic bodies containing
intact cytoplasmic organelles or fragments of the nucleus,
resulting in a programmed and very regulated form
of cell death executed by caspases and Bcl-2 family
proteins [4]. Autophagy is an intracellular degradative
system that plays important roles in regulating protein
homeostasis, and is essential for survival when cells
are faced with metabolic stress [5, 6]. Accumulating
evidence suggests that cancer cells tend to have reduced
autophagy relative to their normal counterparts and to
premalignant lesions [7]. Several molecular and cellsignaling pathways have been implicated in regulating
autophagy, such as the autophagy-related gene family [8],
Beclin-1 [9], mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) [10], and
the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target
of rapamycin (PI3K-AKT-mTOR) pathways [11] Several
pieces of evidence have also suggested that autophagy
triggers tumor cell death in response to various antitumor agents [12, 13]. In contrast, autophagy induced by
chemotherapy or radiotherapy may prevent cells from
undergoing apoptosis, producing unfavorable conditions
after anti-tumor therapy [14]. Thus, autophagy is also
implicated in the promotion of cellular self-destruction,
presumably due to the induction of mitochondriadependent or -independent death signaling pathways, or
to the irreversible destruction of cellular contents [15, 16].
However, the detailed mechanisms of different anticancer
drug treatments, all of which necessarily involve the
relationship between autophagy and apoptosis to some
degree, are still poorly understood.
Licochalcone A (LicA) is a characteristic chalcone
of licorice, which is the root of Glycyrrhiza inflata Batalin
[17]. It is the most potent component of licorice and has
been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial
activities [18], as well as anti-tumor effects [19,20].
LicA can induce prostate cancer apoptosis through the
modulation of bcl-2 protein expression [19], suppress
the migration of endothelial cells and the proliferation
of smooth muscle by decreasing ERK1/2 activities
and Rb phosphorylation, and block the progression
of the cell cycle [21]. Moreover, mice fed with LicA
exhibit significantly reduced tumor formation as well as
reductions in the number of cells expressing proliferating
cell nuclear antigen, beta-catenin, COX-2, and iNOS in
the colon; LicA also significantly increases survival and
inhibits liver metastasis, as well as the expression of matrix
metalloproteinase-9 in the liver [20]. Recently, we also
found that LicA could inhibit the invasion and migration
of HCC cell lines via inhibition of the expression of uPA
via the MKK4/JNK pathway [22]. Recent reports suggest
that natural compounds, such as curcumin, resveratrol,
oridonin, and quercetin, may induce cancer cell death
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by activating core autophagic pathways [23]. To our
knowledge, only one article has been published up to now
regarding the ability of LicA to induce caspase-dependent
and autophagy-related cell death in prostate cancer LNCaP
cells [24]. Hence, alternative cell death pathways (such as
autophagic cell death) are of interest for drug development
and cancer chemotherapy [25]. However, there is limited
evidence for the effects of LicA on the underlying
mechanisms in human cervical cancer cells.
The aim of the present study was to clarify the
mode of action of LicA in the context of its anti-tumor
activity, and to investigate the relationship between
apoptosis and autophagy both in vitro and in vivo. Our
data show that LicA treatment inhibited the growth of
human cervical cancer cells. We also sought to identify
the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of LicA
on apoptosis and autophagy. The results demonstrated
that LicA induces caspase-dependent apoptosis and that
LicA-induced early autophagy is mainly dependent on the
induction of autophagosomes; the conversion of LC3-I
to II; the induction of Atg5, Atg7, Atg12 and Beclin1;
and the inhibition of Bcl-2. The data indicate that LicA
ultimately induces apoptosis through the inhibition of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and the activation of caspases.
We also found that LicA-induced apoptosis is enhanced
by Akt inhibitor, siRNA-Akt, and rapamycin (mTOR
inhibitor). Taken together, our observations suggest that
LicA should be regarded as a promising anti-cancer agent
against cervical cancer cells, and that the inhibition of
PI3K/Akt/mTOR-mediated autophagy may enhance the
anti-tumor effects of LicA, such that this inhibition may
have therapeutic implications in the treatment of cervical
cancer.

(10,000 units/mL penicillin, 10 μg/mL streptomycin
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) in a
humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 at 37 °C.

Immunofluorescence assay
For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were grown
on glass coverslips and fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde
solution for 10 min at room temperature. After rinsing
with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton
X-100 for 5 min. Following another rinse with PBS, cells
were blocked for 15 min at room temperature with 5%
BSA buffer. The LC3 antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA
and incubated on cells at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 2 hours.
The coverslips were washed with PBS and placed in
rabbit anti-DyLight 488 for 1 hour at room temperature.
The cells were washed with PBS and counterstained with
DAPI. The cells were examined and photographed by
immunofluorescence microscopy.

Cell viability assay
The cytotoxic activity of LicA was measured using
the MTT assay. SiHa and HeLa cells were treated with
LicA at various concentrations (0, 10, 30, and 50 µM) for
various periods of time (24 and 48 hours), and then washed
once and incubated with MTT (0.5 mg/mL) at 37°C for
4 hours. The purple formazan crystals were dissolved in
0.5 mL of isopropanol. After 10 min, the plates were read
on an automated microplate spectrophotometer (Sunrise,
Tecan, Austria) at 570 nm. Assays were performed in
triplicate on three independent experiments.

RESULTS
LicA inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in
human cervical cancer cells
The chemical structure of Licochalcone A
(LicA) is shown in Figure 1A. Prior to investigating
the pharmacological potential of LicA for affecting
human cervical cancer cell viability, we first assayed the
cytotoxicity of LicA by treating SiHa and HeLa cells with
LicA at various concentrations (0, 10, 30, and 50 µM) for
24 and 48 hours by using an MTT assay. We found that
LicA treatment resulted in significantly decreased viability
in SiHa and HeLa cells in a dose- and time-dependent
manner, with IC50 values of 42.2 ± 3.5 µM and 48.5 ±
4.2 µM after 24 hours; IC50 values of 32.9 ± 4.2 µM
and 40.3±0.8 µM after 48 hours of treatment, respectively
(Figure 1B, 1C). Similarly, as shown in Table  1, LicA
also inhibited the growth of two other human cervical
cancer cell lines (C33A, CaSki and HeLa). Interestingly,
LicA was found to be less cytotoxic on two normal cells
(HK-2 and WI-38). SiHa and HeLa cells were chosen
to represent human cervical cancer for the subsequent
studies to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms
of LicA.
To determine whether LicA could induce apoptosis
in SiHa and HeLa cells, SiHa and HeLa cells were
incubated with different concentrations of LicA (0, 10,
30, and 50 µM) and for different durations (0, 6, 12 and
24 hours) with 50 µM LicA. By performing annexin
V-FITC/PI double stained assay by flow cytometry, LicA
was found to induce apoptosis in SiHa and HeLa cells
in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 1D). To
further delineate the mechanism by which LicA induced
apoptosis in these SiHa and HeLa cells, western blotting
assay was performed and revealed that LicA significantly
increased the expression of cleaved-caspase-3, cleavedcaspase-9, and cleaved-PARP, while decreasing the
expression of Bcl-2 in a dose- and time-dependent
manner (Figure 1E). In addition, SiHa and HeLa cells
were also pretreated for 2 hours with a pan-caspase
inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK (25 µM), and then incubated
with LicA (50 µM) for 24 hours, and the subsequent
MTT assays revealed significantly pretreatment with
Z-VAD-FMK could effectively attenuate LicA-induced
cell viability (Figure 1F) and cell apoptosis (Figure 1G).
These results revealed that LicA could induce apoptosis
in human SiHa and HeLa cells via the caspase-dependent
apoptosis pathway.

Tumor xenograft in nude mice
Tumors were established by injection of 5 × 106
SiHa cells s.c. into the armpit of 4-to 5-week old BALB/c
female athymic mice (National Laboratory Animal Center,
Taipei, Taiwan). All animal studies were conducted
according to the protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Chung
Shan Medical University (IACUC Approval No. 1071).
Treatments were initiated when tumors reached a mean
group size of approximately 85 mm3. Tumor volume
(cubic millimeters) was measured with calipers, and it was
calculated as 0.5236 × L (W)2, where W is the width and L
is the length of tumor. LicA was administered i.p. to mice
1 times/3 day for 28 days. Tumor volumes were recorded
every 7 days until animals were sacrificed.

Immunohistochemistry
3 mm thick, from representative tissue blocks
were cut, deparaffinised with xylene rinse and
rehydrated with distilled water through graded alcohol.
Immunohistochemical staining was performed on the
other four slides using the two-step procedure. The slides
were then incubated overnight at 4°C in humidified
chambers with human Ki-67 (Abcam; diluted 1:200),
cleaved-caspase-3 (Cell signaling; diluted 1:200), cleavedPARP rabbit monoclonal antibody (Cell signaling; diluted
1:100) and anti-human LC3 rabbit monoclonal antibody
(Cell signaling; diluted 1:500) were used. The slides were
washed three times in a phosphate buffered solution and
further incubated with a secondary antibody for 30 min at
room temperature. After washing in phosphate buffered
solution, the immunolabeled sections were incubated
with biotin-conjugated secondary antibody for 20 min
at room temperature, then with peroxidase-conjugated
complex (Dako) for 20 min, and finally visualized with 3,
3’-diaminobenzidin and counterstained with hematoxylin,
and then examined by light microscopy.

Statistical analysis
Statistically significant differences were calculated
using the Student’s t-test (Sigma-Stat 2.0, Jandel

more efficient. After transfection with GFP-LC3 and
treatment with LicA for 48 hours, cytoplasmic LC3II
formation was observed to occur in a dose-dependent
manner in HeLa cells treated with LicA (Figure 2E,
upper). Moreover, Western blotting assays indicated that
the expression levels of LC3-II were increased in a dosedependent manner (Figure 2E, down). Together, these
results supported the idea that LicA induced autophagy in
SiHa and HeLa cells.

The autophagic pathway begins with the formation
of a double-membrane vesicle called the “autophagosome”
that engulfs organelles or long-lived proteins and then
matures into an acidic single-membrane autophagosome
that fuses with a lysosome to become the “autolysosome”.
This process is known to be accompanied by an increase
in the acidity of the lumen, followed by the development
of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs) [26]. AVO reagent
staining showed that the relative fluorescence intensity of
SiHa and HeLa cells was increased in a dose- and timedependent manner (Figure 2A, upper). The quantification
of AVO cells by flow cytometry assay (Figure 2A, down)
also indicated the occurrence of autophagy. The amount
of LC3-II cleaved product is correlated with the extent
of autophagosome formation and detection of autophagic
activity [27, 28]. To elucidate whether LicA could induce
autophagy in SiHa cells, SiHa cells were incubated with
various concentrations of LicA (0, 10, 30, and 50 µM) and
for different durations (0, 6, 12 and 24 hours) with 50 µM
LicA. According to Western blotting assays, we found
that SiHa cells treated with increasing concentrations of
LicA resulted in dose-dependent increased expression
of LC3-II (Figure 2B). Similarly, confocal fluorescence
microscopy indicated that LicA increased the formation of
LC3-II in SiHa cells treated with 50 µM LicA or incubated
in 50 µM LicA for 24 hours (Figure 2C). In addition,
a trend of increased expression of other autophagyassociated proteins such as Beclin1, Atg5, and Atg7 with
increased expression of Atg12 was also observed in LicA
treated cells (Figure 2D). When performing a GFP-LC3
transfection study, we used the HeLa cervical cancer cell
line instead of the SiHa cell line because doing so was

Inhibition of autophagy enhances LicA-induced
apoptosis
As described above, we found that SiHa cells treated
with LicA exhibited increased apoptosis and autophagy.
To determine the inter-relationship between apoptosis and
autophagy after treating SiHa cells with LicA, we found
that treating SiHa cells with LicA and 10 mM 3-MA
(an inhibitor of autophagy) increased the expression
of cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved
PARP, and decreased the expression of Bcl-2 more than
treating SiHa cells with LicA alone (Figure 3A). Here,
we used bafilomycin A (BA), an autophagy-lysosomal
inhibitor [29]. MTT assays showed that the apoptotic
effect of LicA on SiHa cells was enhanced when LicA
was combined with 3-MA or BA in comparison to
treatment with LicA alone (Figure 3B). In addition,
annexin V-FITC/PI double stained assays revealed that
treatment of SiHa cells with LicA and 3-MA or BA
resulted in a significantly greater number of apoptotic
cells than treatment with LicA alone (Figure 3C).
Moreover, after transfection with GFP-LC3 for
48 hours, then treatment with LicA for another 24 hours,
cytoplasmic LC3II formation was observed in HeLa cells
treated with LicA (Figure 3D, upper), and subsequent

addition, SiHa cells after knockdown of Atg12/Beclin1 for
48 hours, as subsequent treatment with LicA for another
24 hours resulted in remarkably increased cell apoptosis
(Figure 3E, 3F). These results indicated that suppression
of autophagy could enhanced the LicA-induced apoptosis.

the growth of tumors was significantly reduced by 43.8%
and 61.2%, respectively (Figure 6A and 6B), compared
with DMSO controls. Ultimately, there were no significant
differences in mean body weight between the control
group and the treatment groups, which indicated that
there were no adverse effects from feeding nude mice with
LicA (Figure 6C). In addition, the tumor weights of SiHa

DISCUSSION
It had been known that cervical cancer leaded the
third-most cancer among women worldwide, resulting in
an annual 250,000 deaths [32]. Its incidence in developed
countries, however, has decreased by around 70% over
the past 50 years due to improved screening methods in
cervical cytology [33]. Recently, many naturally grown
plant agents have been reported to induce autophagy, but
the effects of altered autophagy are inconsistent, because
it can either protect cells from apoptosis or promote cell
death [34, 35]. One of the flavonoids, Licochalcone A,
which is the root of Glycyrrhiza inflate, has previously been
reported to have effects on cell cycle progression, such
as inhibiting the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle
cells by blocking G1 to S phase progression [21], arresting
progression at the G2/M phase transition in prostate
cancer [36] and gastric cancer [37], and inhibiting the
invasion and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells

by inhibiting uPA expression [22]. Some researchers have
also reported that isoliquiritigenin, which is a constituent
of licorice (Glycyrrhiza inflate), can decrease cell viability,
induce the accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase, and
enhance apoptosis, in addition to causing changes in Bax
and Bak expression, decreasing the expression of Bcl-2 and
Bid proform, triggering dissipation of the mitochondrial
membrane potential, and releasing cytochrome c to the
cytosol followed by activation of the caspase cascade
with cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP [38,
39]. This sequence of events is strongly supported by the
results of the current study. First, we found that LicA is a
potent inhibitor of cervical cancer cells in vitro. Second,
we found that LicA induces apoptosis and autophagy
in cervical cancer cells. Third, the selective autophagy
protein Beclin 1, Atg5, Atg7, Atg12 and autophagosomeassociated form (LC3-II) was demonstrated by western
blotting. Fourth, the results showed that LicA induced its
effects on autophagy and apoptosis in cervical cancer cells
via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
(Figure 7). Finally, xenograft tumor growth was inhibited
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by LicA. Overall, the results indicate that LicA activated
the autophagic and apoptotic processes in vitro in cancer
cells and in vivo in tumor xenograft models.
Autophagy, which is characterized by the
accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, no forming of
apoptotic bodies, no condensing of chromosomes, and
caspase independence, is a process of physiological
cell death that occurs during development. Another
type of programmed cell death, apoptosis, involves the
early collapse of cytoskeletal elements but preservation
of organelles until late in the process and is caspasedependent [40]. Although the role of the autophagic
process in antitumor therapy has not been clearly
elucidated, many studies have demonstrated that these two
types of cell death are predominantly distinctive but that
cross-talk also occurs between them [41–43]. In this study,
we found that LicA-treated SiHa cells presented with more
annexin V-positive cells and expressed enhanced activities
in terms of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved
PARP, but less Bcl-2, all of which indicated the ability of
LicA to induce apoptosis. We considered the possibility
28862

Oncotarget

that LicA could inhibit the growth of cervical cancer cells
by concomitantly inducing apoptosis and autophagy.
Studies had previously shown that after treatment with
antitumor drugs, some cancer cells undergo autophagy as
a temporary survival mechanism, and the suppression of
autophagy leads to apoptosis, thus enhancing antitumor
effects; however, some treatments also result in the
induction of autophagic cell death or both apoptosis and
autophagy. Xu et al. proposed that inhibiting autophagy by
3-MA or chloroquine in cervical cancer enhanced cellular
apoptosis [41]. Sun et al. found that over-expression
of Beclin-1, which is an autophagy-related gene, may
enhance the activity of apoptosis in cervical cancer cells
[44]. Hou et al. reported that fucoxanthin induces HeLa
cervical cell autophagy but not apoptosis, even with 3-MA
pretreatment [45]. Hsu et al. found increased activities of
apoptosis, autophagy, and anti-proliferation after treating
cervical cancer cells with resveratrol [40]. So, it seems
that there is complex relationship between autophagy and
apoptosis when cells are treated with different substances.
However, the exact role of autophagy in cancer treatment,
and the question of whether it can protect cells from the
cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs by blocking apoptosis
or by killing cells as an alternate pathway to cell death
is still controversial [46]. In this study, we found that for
cervical cancer cells treated with LicA, autophagy might
play a role in fine tuning the cellular apoptotic ability.
The autophagic genes Beclin-1, Atg5, Atg7,
Atg12, and LC3 are responsible for autophagosome
biogenesis [47]. Atg7 is reported to be essential for
Atg12 conjugation and LC3 modification systems,
and the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II correlates with
autophagosome formation [48]. Recent studies have
also shown that the expression of Atg5, Atg7, and Atg12
proteins plays a role in autophagic/apoptotic cell death
and gastrointestinal cancer pathogenesis [49, 50]. Patients
with increased Beclin1 expression in their cancer cells
exhibit longer survival [51], and so Beclin1 expression
has been postulated to act as a tumor suppressor [52].
In this study, we demonstrated by western blotting that
LicA increases the expression levels of Atg5, Atg7, Atg12,
Beclin1, and LC3-II in a time-dependent manner in SiHa
cells. This finding is consistent with a recent report that
dendropanoxide (DP), which comes from the leaves and
stem of Dendropanax morbiferus H.Lév, induced a timedependent accumulation of Atg7, Beclin1, and LC3-II in
osteosarcoma cells, and that treatment with U0126, 3-MA,
and wortmannin significantly decreased DP-induced
autophagy that was accompanied by increased apoptosis
[53]. Another study, reported that aristolochic acid I (AAI)
induced autophagy and apoptosis in renal tubular epithelial
cells, and that the knockdown of Beclin1 or Atg7 not only
decreased the LC3-II formation induced by AAI, but also
induced apoptosis [54]. Our study demonstrates that gene
silencing of Atg12 and Beclin1, or cotreatment of the
cervical cancer with 3-MA or BA, inhibits LicA-induced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

autophagy. Therefore, LicA-induced autophagy may
serve as a protective mechanism against LicA-induced
apoptosis.
Bcl-2 was reported to act as an anti-autophagy
protein via its inhibitory interaction with Beclin-1 in
various cancer cells [55.56]. In human leukemic HL60
cells, down-regulation of Bcl-2 was induced autophagyrelated cell death [57]. Tetrapeptide ICE inhibitor induced
loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
and promoted cell death, which it may be attributed to
the decreased expression of Bcl-2 in [58]. Recently,
it has been reported that silibinin induced the LC3-II
expression which closely correlate with the number of
autophagosomes, as well as Atg12-Atg5 formation were
increased, elevated expression of Beclin1 which was
accompanied by a decreased level of Bcl-2 in MCF7 breast
cancer cells [59]. Licorice extract and LicA may have
induced an imbalance between Bcl-2 and Beclin1 levels
in LNCaP cells, leading to the promotion of autophagy
[24]. Consistent with the our finding of enhanced LC3-II
and Atg-related proteins expression by LicA-treated
cervical cancer cells, Therefore, it is possible that LicAinhibited autophagy was accompanied by apoptosis, and
the interplay between apoptosis and autophagy occurred,
which warrants further investigation.
Many pieces of evidence suggest that the
cross-talk between apoptosis and autophagy is made
especially complicated by the fact that they share many
common regulatory molecules, such as Bcl-2 and the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway [60]. It is well
known that the PI3K/Akt pathway serves as a critical
signaling axis in cell growth, proliferation, and cell
survival, but intriguingly, several lines of evidence
suggest that this pathway could also provide a prodeath signal, especially for necrotic cell death [61]. For
instance, it has been reported that the activation of PI3K
and Akt sensitized the necrotic cell death in response
to glucose deprivation or hypoxia in rat cardiomyocytes
[62] and mouse Lewis lung carcinoma cells, respectively
[63]. LicA could induces ROS-mediated MAPKs
activation, inhibit PI3K/AKT pathway, and lead to
gastric cancer cell apoptosis [64]. The inhibitory effects
of LicA on PI3K/Akt are consistent with the prevention
of phosphorylation of Akt downstream targets. mTOR
is major downstream target of Akt, and inhibition of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway has been shown to initiate
autophagy and apoptosis [65.66]. Here, we observed
the role of the mTOR pathway in autophagy pathway,
because some studies indicated that inhibition of the
Akt-mTOR pathway was consistently associated with
triggering autophagy in tumor cells [67]. It have been
reported that phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 is
associated with resistance to apoptosis by controlling
subcellular localization of pro-apoptotic proteins
[68]. Our data showed that the LicA decrease in Akt
at Ser473 phosphorylation in SiHa and HeLa cells.
28863

Oncotarget

It can be suggested that phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473
may play a protective role in LicA-induced apoptosis.
Moreover, pretreatment of mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin)
not only reinforces the apoptotic-inducing activity and
antitumor capacity of LicA, but also probably autophagy
induction. Therefore, our study demonstrated that
mTOR might act as an important factor governing the
cross talk between apoptosis and autophagy in human
cervical cancer cells. Notwithstanding, the role of
mTOR in manipulating LicA-induced cell apoptosis and
autophagy appears complicated and needs to be further
explored.
In the present study, we found that LicA
substantially increased the levels of LC3-II, in addition
to increasing caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP cleavage,
in cervical cancer cells, all of which suggested that LicA
induces both apoptosis and autophagy in these cells. We
also found, via an in vivo study, that LicA inhibited the
growth of xenografts of cervical cancer in nude mice.
The phenomenon of enhanced apoptotic ability cause by
combining LicA treatment with an autophagy inhibitor and
PI3K suggested that LicA-induced autophagy prevents
cervical cancer cells from undergoing notable apoptosis.
Collectively, we conclude that LicA induced apoptosis,
inhibited PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, and resulted in
autophagy, highlighting a basic mechanism accounting
for the anticancer activity of LicA and a potential strategy
to enhance the anticancer efficacy of LicA by preventing
autophagy.
