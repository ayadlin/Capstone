Abstract
Estrogen receptor (ER) a–positive breast cancers initially
respond to antiestrogens but eventually become estrogen independent and recur. ERþ breast cancer cells resistant to long-term
estrogen deprivation (LTED) exhibit hormone-independent ER
transcriptional activity and growth. A kinome-wide siRNA
screen using a library targeting 720 kinases identiﬁed Polo-like
kinase 1 (PLK1) as one of the top genes whose downregulation
resulted in inhibition of estrogen-independent ER transcriptional activity and growth of LTED cells. High PLK1 mRNA and
protein correlated with a high Ki-67 score in primary ERþ breast
cancers after treatment with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole.
RNAi-mediated knockdown of PLK1 inhibited ER expression,
estrogen-independent growth, and ER transcription in MCF7
and HCC1428 LTED cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of PLK1
with volasertib, a small-molecule ATP-competitive PLK1 inhibitor, decreased LTED cell growth, ER transcriptional activity,

Introduction
Most breast cancers express estrogen receptor a (ERa) and are
driven by estrogen (1–3). Targeting the function of ER with
receptor antagonists such as tamoxifen, fulvestrant, and aromatase
inhibitors (AI), such as anastrozole and letrozole, are effective
treatments for patients with this subtype of breast cancer (4–7).
However, a signiﬁcant number of patients with ERþ tumors,

and ER expression. Volasertib in combination with the ER
antagonist, fulvestrant, decreased MCF7 xenograft growth in
ovariectomized mice more potently than each drug alone.
JUNB, a component of the AP-1 complex, was expressed
16-fold higher in MCF7/LTED compared with parental MCF7
cells. Furthermore, JUNB and BCL2L1 (which encodes antiapoptotic BCL-xL) mRNA levels were markedly reduced upon
volasertib treatment in MCF7/LTED cells, while they were
increased in parental MCF7 cells. Finally, JUNB knockdown
decreased ER expression and transcriptional activity in MCF7/
LTED cells, suggesting that PLK1 drives ER expression and
estrogen-independent growth via JUNB. These data support a
critical role of PLK1 in acquired hormone-independent growth
of ERþ human breast cancer and is therefore a promising target
in tumors that have escaped estrogen deprivation therapy.

particularly those with advanced disease, exhibit primary and
acquired resistance to antiestrogens (8–11). Most mechanisms
that mediate this resistance are not yet fully understood. Therefore,
identifying those mechanisms and strategies to interfere with them
is needed to prevent or delay acquired endocrine resistance and
improve patient outcome. We and others have modeled secondary
resistance to treatment with AIs, the equivalent of estrogen deprivation in postmenopausal patients, by generating long-term
estrogen-deprived (LTED) cells, whereby ERþ human breast cancer
cells have adapted to estrogen deprivation and acquired robust
growth under hormone-free conditions (12–14). In this study, we
used ERþ MCF7/LTED and HCC1428/LTED breast cancer cells,
which overexpress ER and retain estrogen-independent ER binding
to DNA and ER transcriptional activity (15).
To identify targetable molecules that drive hormone-independent growth and ER transcription in LTED cells, we performed a screen using a library with siRNA pools targeting 720
kinases. We used two metrics in this assay: (i) luciferase activity
as assessed by using an estrogen-response-element (ERE)-regulated reporter and (ii) cell viability measured by the Alamar Blue
assay. In this screen, we identiﬁed Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) as
the top hit whose downregulation decreased both ER transcriptional activity and cell viability. PLK1 is a serine/threonine
kinase that is highly expressed during the G2 phase of the cell
cycle where it controls the metaphase-to-anaphase transition
and mitotic exit (16–18). PLK1 is one of three isoforms of PLKs

(PLK2 and PLK3; refs. 19, 20) and has been shown to be overexpressed in several human cancers (21–25). Currently, PLK1speciﬁc small-molecule inhibitors are in clinical trials in patients
with advanced cancer (26, 27). Herein, we discovered that
genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of PLK1 decreased ER
expression, estrogen-independent ER-mediated transcriptional
activity, and growth of ERþ xenografts alone and in combination with fulvestrant. These results provide a basis for combinations of PLK1 inhibitors with ER downregulators in patients
with hormone-independent ERþ breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
Parental cancer cell lines were from ATCC and maintained in
improved minimum essential medium (IMEM)/10% FBS
(Gibco) as previously described (28). LTED cells were generated
in and maintained in phenol red-free IMEM with 10% dextran/
charcoal-treated FBS (DCC-FBS) as previously described (28).
BI2536 and volasertib were obtained from Selleckchem. Fulvestrant was obtained from the Vanderbilt Hospital Outpatient
Pharmacy (Nashville, TN). FOXM1-EE construct was a gift from
Junjie Chen (Yale University; New Haven, CT; ref. 29). The
myristoylated-PLK1 construct (Addgene plasmid 20859) was a
gift from William Hahn (Dana Farber Cancer Institute; Boston,
MA; ref. 30).
RNAi screen
MCF-7/LTED cells were transfected with the Dharmacon RTF
Protein Kinase siRNA library (14) as described in Supplementary
Methods. Secondary validation was performed with four independent siRNAs against GSG2, RPS6KA2, and PLK1 (Qiagen).
qRT-PCR
Cells maintained in 10% DCC-FBS were transfected with control or PLK1 siRNA oligonucleotides (Thermo Scientiﬁc) with
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX for 48 to 72 hours. Cells were harvested
and their RNA extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).
Using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad), 1 mg of RNA was
reverse transcribed to cDNA and real-time PCR reactions were
conducted in 96-well plates using the iCycler iQ (Bio-Rad) and
primers obtained from SA Biosciences (Qiagen). RNA was
extracted from MCF7 and MCF7/LTED cells that had been treated
with volasertib or transfected with PLK1 siRNA; cDNA was
applied to the Estrogen Receptor Signaling PCR Array (SA Biosciences). Fold changes in gene expression were determined
using the web-based software from SA Biosciences (http://
www.qiagen.com/us/products/genes%20and%20pathways/dataanalysis-center-overview-page/). Genes identiﬁed in the array were
veriﬁed by qRT-PCR.
Cell proliferation assays
Cells seeded in triplicate in 12-well plates (2.5  104 cells/well
for MCF-7/LTED and 4  104 cells/well for other lines) were
treated in 10% DCC-FBS. Media and inhibitors were replenished
every 3 days; after 5 to 10 days, adherent cells were trypsinized and
counted using a Coulter Counter or ﬁxed/stained with crystal
violet. Crystal violet-stained plates were scanned using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences) and the staining intensity was quantiﬁed using the manufacturer's analysis
software. For the combination studies of volasertib and fulves-

trant, MCF7 and MCF7/LTED cells were seeded in 96-well black
plates followed by the Alamar Blue Assay after 72 hours as
described in the Supplementary Methods.
Immunoblot analysis
Cells were lysed with NP40 lysis buffer (150 mmol/L Tris,
pH 7.4, 100 mmol/L NaF, 120 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% NP-40,
100 mmol/L sodium vanadate, and 1 protease inhibitor cocktail; Roche). Lysates (40 mg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes; these were ﬁrst incubated with primary antibodies at 4 C overnight or at room
temperature for 2 hours, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 hour at
room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by
enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientiﬁc). All primary
antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology except the ERa
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Transcriptional reporter assays
Cells were plated as above and transfected with pGLB-MERE
(encodes estrogen response element-regulated Fireﬂy luciferase),
pGL4.23 vectors (Peak2 or Peak5 Fireﬂy luciferase; ref. 28) and
pTK-Renilla (encodes TK-driven Renilla luciferase; Promega) plasmids. Cells were then treated as above; luciferase activity was
measured 16 to 20 hours later using the Dual Luciferase Kit
(Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions utilizing
a Moonlight 3010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence
Laboratory). The same procedure was used for the pCAGA (provided by J.-M. Gauthier, Laboratoire GlaxoSmithKline), pGL2E-cadherin (31), and pGL-ErbB3 (32) Fireﬂy Luciferase reporters.
Xenograft studies
Animal experiments were approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Female ovariectomized
athymic nude mice (Foxn1nu 4–5 weeks old; Harlan–Sprague–
Dawley) were implanted subcutaneously with a 14-day release,
0.17-mg, 17b-estradiol pellet (Innovative Research of America).
Twenty-four hours later, 5  106 MCF7 cells suspended in IMEM
and Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at 1:1 ratio were injected subcutaneously into the right ﬂank of each mouse. Approximately 4
weeks later, mice bearing tumors measuring 150 mm3 were
randomized to treatment with vehicle (control), volasertib (10
mg/kg/day via orogastric gavage), fulvestrant (5 mg/week s.c.), or
both drugs. Animal weight and tumor diameters (with calipers)
were measured twice weekly and tumor volume was calculated
with the formula: volume ¼ width2  length/2. After 6 weeks,
tumors were harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or ﬁxed
in 10% neutral-buffered formalin followed by embedding in
parafﬁn for IHC analysis.

Results
PLK1 siRNA oligonucleotides inhibit ER transcriptional activity
and cell growth
Initially, we transfected cells with ERE ﬁreﬂy-luciferase and
Renilla-luciferase constructs. Transfection with ERa siRNA
decreased ERE-ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity. Importantly, the Renilla
reading was markedly decreased (93%), resulting in a greater
ﬁreﬂy/Renilla ratio compared with control siRNA-transfected cells
(Supplementary Table S1). In the Alamar Blue assay, ER siRNA

PLK1 Drives Hormone-Independent ERþ Breast Cancer

Figure 1.
RNAi screen identiﬁed PLK1 is required for hormone-independent ER transcriptional activity and growth. A, MCF-7/LTED cells were screened with a siRNA
library targeting 720 kinases. Ligand-independent cell growth and ER transcriptional activities were sequentially measured 72 hours later using a highthroughput Alamar Blue and luciferase reporter assays, respectively. Both cell growth and ER transcriptional activity for each kinase siRNA relative to
nonsilencing controls (siCTL) were transformed to a Z-score; the data are presented as median Z-score across three independent experiments. B,
knockdown of 48 and 26 kinases signiﬁcantly decreased MCF7/LTED cell proliferation and ER transcription, respectively. Knockdown of 10 kinases was found
to decrease both cell viability and ER transcription. C, MCF7/LTED and HCC1428/LTED cells transfected with RNAi-targeting PLK1 and cultured for 5 days.
Cells were trypsinized and their number determined in a Coulter Counter ( , P < 0.01). D, MCF7/LTED and HCC1428/LTED cells were transfected with
control (CTL) or PLK1 siRNA and reseeded in 12-well plates in full growth media. Media were replenished every 3 days and the cells were stained with
crystal violet after 7 days ( , P < 0.0002). E, RNAi-mediated PLK1 downmodulation was validated by qRT-PCR in MCF7/LTED and HCC1428/LTED cells
( , P < 0.01). F, MCF7/LTED cells were transfected with CTL or PLK1 siRNA for 72 hours. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis
for ER, PLK1, and actin.

decreased cell viability only by 62% (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
These results suggested that RNAi oligonucleotides reducing
ER expression had a nonspeciﬁc effect on Renilla expression in
MCF7/LTED cells, thus skewing the results. For this reason, we
could not use Renilla expression as a control in cells transfected
with the siRNA pools. We next assessed whether LTED cell
viability (Alamar Blue) and ERE luciferase activity can be measured consecutively. Fireﬂy luciferase activity was similar in cells
transfected with MERE-luc in the presence or absence of Alamar
Blue dye (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1C). Therefore, MCF7/
LTED cells were next transfected with an ERE-luciferase construct
and with siRNA pools targeting 720 kinases (schema in Supplementary Fig. S1A). Both cell viability (Alamar Blue) and ER
reporter activity for each siRNA relative to nonsilencing controls
(siCTL) were transformed to a Z-score; the median Z-score across
three independent experiments was then calculated (Fig. 1A).
Knockdown of 58 and 36 kinases was observed to signiﬁcantly
decrease cell viability and ER reporter activity, respectively (Fig. 1B
and Supplementary Table S2). Of these, 10 kinases scored positive
in both assays. Statistical analysis identiﬁed PLK1, RPS6KA2, and

www.aacrjournals.org

GSG2 as the top hits inhibiting both ER transcriptional activity
and viability of MCF7/LTED cells (Table 1). We next validated
the effect of these three genes using four independent siRNA
oligonucleotides for each of them (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Only in the case of PLK1, all four independent siRNA oligos
decreased both ERE luciferase activity and cell viability.
PLK1 downmodulation with siRNA resulted in inhibition
of proliferation and focus formation in monolayer of both
MCF7/LTED and HCC1428/LTED cells (Fig. 1C and D). Knockdown of PLK1 was validated by both qRT-PCR and immunoblot
analysis. Interestingly, PLK1 siRNA also decreased ERa protein
levels (Fig. 1E and F), suggesting that PLK1 has a role in ligandindependent ER transcriptional activity and ERþ breast cancer cell
growth via regulation of ERa expression.
To investigate the potential clinical signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings, we correlated Ki-67 levels (a marker of cell proliferation)
with PLK1 protein and mRNA expression in tumor biopsies
from patients with an operable ERþ/HER2– breast cancer that
had been treated with the AI letrozole for 10 to 21 days before
surgery. In this setting, Ki-67 levels are used as a surrogate of the

hormone independence because ERþ breast cancers that retain a
high Ki-67 score after therapy are considered resistant to estrogen
deprivation (with letrozole) and vice versa; tumors with a low
posttreatment Ki-67 are considered highly hormone dependent
and, thus, antiestrogen sensitive (11, 33). In tumor biopsies from
patients treated with letrozole, PLK1 protein levels measured by
RPPA positively correlated with the Ki-67 score (Fig. 2A). In
addition, PLK1 mRNA transcript levels measured by RNA-seq
correlated directly with Ki-67 mRNA expression (Fig. 2B and C).

counterparts were assessed for ER and PLK1 expression by immunoblot
analysis. Actin was used as a loading control.

Furthermore, both MCF7 and HCC1428 LTED cells displayed
increased PLK1 expression compared with their parental cell
lines (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that high PLK1 expression
associates with and could be used as a marker of hormoneindependent ERþ breast cancer.
PLK1 downmodulation decreases hormone-independent ER
transcriptional activity
In MCF7/LTED cells, PLK1 siRNA decreased MERE-Luciferase
activity (Fig. 3A) and expression of the ER-responsive genes
progesterone receptor (PR), Trefoil factor 1 (TFF1), and growth
regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (GREB1; Fig. 3B). A
more modest reduction in PR and TFF1 was observed in
HCC1428/LTED cells transfected with PLK1 siRNA. To conﬁrm
that the effects of PLK1 siRNA were on ligand-independent
ER transcription, we generated two luciferase reporters (Peak2
and Peak5) with ER-binding regions proximal to genes reported
to be downregulated by ER siRNA or fulvestrant in the absence
of estrogen (28). Notably, the effect of PLK1 siRNA on the
ligand-independent reporters was similar to that of ER siRNA
oligonucleotides (Fig. 3C). In addition, MCF7/LTED cells were
transfected with both Peak5 ﬁreﬂy luciferase and Renilla luciferase plasmids 2 days after transfection with two independent
PLK1siRNAs to avoid the effects of RNAi on Renilla activity. We
observed that both PLK1 siRNA oligonucleotides decreased
estrogen-independent ER reporter activity (Supplementary
Fig. S3) when measured as a ratio of ﬁreﬂy to Renilla luciferase.
Conversely, overexpression of PLK1 in MCF7/LTED cells
increased >4-fold Peak5-Luc reporter activity (Fig. 3D). To
show that the effect of PLK1 downregulation on ER transcription was speciﬁc to ER and not secondary to an overall effect on
chromatin segregation during mitosis, we examined other
transcriptional reporters. PLK1 and ER siRNA did not affect
the activity of the transcriptional reporters driven by SMAD,
E-cadherin, and ERBB3 promoter binding regions in MCF7/
LTED cells (Figs. 3E–G).
PLK1 inhibitor decreases hormone-independent growth and
ER transcriptional activity in LTED cells
We next used BI2536 and volasertib, small-molecule inhibitors derived from the dihydropteridinone class of compounds
that target the ATP-binding pocket in the PLK1 kinase domain
(34). Growth of MCF7/LTED and HCC1428/LTED cells was
inhibited by low nmol/L concentrations of both BI2536 and
volasertib in dose-dependent fashion (Figs. 4A and B), whereas
parental MCF7 cells were only inhibited by concentrations in
excess of 10 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S4A). In both LTED cell
lines, treatment with volasertib abrogated hormone-independent ER reporter activity (Fig. 4C) and reduced ER protein levels
(Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S4B). Furthermore, volasertib
increased expression of cleaved PARP, an apoptotic marker, and
phosphorylated Histone H2AX, a marker of DNA damage and
fragmentation (Fig. 4E and Supplementary Fig. S4B).
Volasertib enhances the antitumor effect of fulvestrant in vivo
We next investigated whether combined inhibition of PLK1
and ER with volasertib and the ER antagonist fulvestrant, respectively, would have a synergistic antitumor effect. Volasertib
enhanced the antiproliferative effect of fulvestrant in MCF7 and
MCF7/LTED cells (Fig. 5A and B and Supplementary Fig. S4C).
The combination of fulvestrant and volasertib also increased

PLK1 downmodulation abrogates estrogen-dependent and -independent ER transcriptional activity. A, MCF7/LTED cells were transfected with CTL, PLK1,

18 hours later ( , P < 0.0001). MCF7/LTED cells were transfected with CTL, PLK1, or ER siRNA or treated with 1 nmol/L estradiol (E2). After 48 hours,
cells were transfected with pCAGA-Luc (E), Ecad-Luc (F), ErbB3-Luc (G) reporter constructs; a luciferase assay was performed the following day as

expression of cleaved PARP and phospho-Histone H2AX, whereas
each drug alone did not (Fig. 5C). To examine the effect of the
combination in vivo, we established MCF7 xenografts in ovariectomized nude mice. Mice with tumors measuring 150 mm3
were treated with vehicle, volasertib, fulvestrant, or the combination of both inhibitors. After 6 weeks of treatment, the combination induced a statistically superior antitumor effect compared with fulvestrant or volasertib alone (Fig. 5D). During this
period, the mice in all 4 treatment groups displayed stable body
weight (data not shown) and no signs of toxicity. Treatment with
volasertib reduced ER levels but the combination of volasertib
and fulvestrant more potently reduced both ER and PR levels as
measured by IHC of tumor sections (Figs. 5E–G).
PLK1 inhibition decreases BCL-xL and JUNB expression in
LTED cells
It has been shown that PLK1 may have a tumor-suppressive
role in cancer, including MCF7 breast cancer cells (21, 35, 36).
On the basis of the ﬁndings from the RNAi screen, we sought to
elucidate mechanistic differences between parental MCF7 and
estrogen-independent MCF7/LTEDs in response to PLK1 loss.
Using an Estrogen Receptor Signaling PCR Array with 84 ER-

associated genes, a 24-hour treatment with each volasertib and
PLK1 siRNA oligonucleotides altered (>1.4-fold) the expression
of seven genes, including ERa, in MCF7 and MCF7/LTED cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5A). Expression of BCL2L1, the gene
encoding BCL-xL, and JUNB was also increased in hormonedependent parental MCF7 cells following treatment with each
volasertib and PLK1 siRNA. In MCF7/LTED cells, however,
volasertib and PLK1 siRNA decreased the expression of both
BCL-xL and JUNB (Fig. 6A and B). HCC1428/LTED cells treated
with volasertib also displayed a modest reduction in BCL-xL
and JUNB, whereas PLK1 siRNA markedly decreased BCL-xL
and JUNB transcript levels (Fig. 6C). BCL-xL and JUNB expression were approximately 5-fold and 17-fold higher, respectively, in MCF7/LTED cells compared with the parental MCF7 cells
(Fig. 6D). We next conﬁrmed that treatment with volasertib
and downmodulation of PLK1 with two independent siRNAs
decreased protein levels of ER, BCL-xL, and JUNB (Fig. 6E).
mRNA and protein levels of BCAR1 (breast cancer antiestrogen
resistance 1), which has been associated with poor prognosis
and resistance to tamoxifen (37), were also decreased upon
treatment with volasertib (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B).
JUNB is a component of the AP-1 transcriptional complex that

drives the expression of genes involved in cellular growth and
development (11). In addition, estrogen-activated ER is known
to bind to AP-1 promoter sites in ERþ breast cancer cells (38).
Therefore, we examined whether PLK1-mediated regulation of
JUNB affected ER expression and transcriptional activity.
MCF7/LTED cells transfected with JUNB siRNA exhibited
reduced hormone-independent ER transcriptional activity (Fig.
6F and Supplementary Fig. S5C) and ER expression (Fig. 6F).
Conversely, JUNB siRNA increased ER expression in the parental MCF7 cells (Fig. 6G). These observations suggest that PLK1
regulates ERa via transcriptional regulation of JUNB.
PLK1 transcription is driven by FOXM1, a member of the
forkhead family of transcription factors (39). PLK1 and FOXM1
have an inter-regulatory relationship as part of a kinase-driven
positive feedback loop that leads to the PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of FOXM1 and potentiation of its activity (29, 40).
Consistent with this positive interaction, transfection of a vector
encoding FOXM1 constitutively phosphorylated at the PLK1 site
(FOXM1-EE) (29) increased ER expression and ER transcriptional
activity (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Treatment with volasertib still
reduced constitutive ER transcriptional reporter activity in the

410 Cancer Res; 75(2) January 15, 2015

FOXM1-EE–expressing cells, suggesting that PLK1 mediates ER
activity downstream of FOXM1 in LTED cells. Supporting an
interaction between FOXM1 and PLK1 in hormone-independent
primary tumors, FOXM1 transcript levels correlated positively
with both Ki-67 and PLK1 mRNA levels in patients with ERþ
breast cancer treated with letrozole (Supplementary Fig. S6B and
S6C). Finally, we determined the effect of PLK1 downmodulation
on the expression of other nuclear receptors involved in breast
cancer pathogenesis, androgen receptor (AR), and ERb. In ERþ
breast cancers, AR expression is associated with lower risk of
recurrence and increased overall survival (41, 42). ERb has been
shown to antagonize ERa by decreasing growth and ERa-mediated transcriptional activity (43). Furthermore, it was recently
shown that ERb can be regulated by activated AR to decrease ERþ
breast cancer cell growth (44). We observed that PLK1 downmodulation augmented the expression of both AR and ERb while
decreasing the expression of the ERa target gene PR (Supplementary Fig. S6D).
These results suggest that, in breast cancer cells that adapt
to estrogen deprivation, PLK1 positively regulates antiapoptotic genes (BCL-xL) and components of the AP-1 (JUNB)

expression and transcriptional activity and is therapeutically
targetable with PLK1 inhibitors in hormone-independent, ERdriven breast cancers.

Discussion
In this study, we identiﬁed PLK1 as a potential therapeutic
target in hormone-independent ERþ breast cancer cells. Using
a high-throughput RNAi screen approach to identify kinases
that contribute to hormone-independent transcriptional activity and tumor cell viability, PLK1 was the top candidate gene
associated with both of these phenotypes. In addition to ER
transcriptional activity, PLK1 downmodulation decreased
ER expression. Consistent with these results, treatment with
the PLK1 inhibitor volasertib reduced LTED cell viability, ER

levels, and ER transcriptional activity. Furthermore, volasertib
enhanced the antitumor action of fulvestrant in MCF7 xenografts via enhanced ER downmodulation. Using an Estrogen
Receptor Signaling PCR Array, we compared the effect of PLK1
inhibition on gene expression in parental and LTED MCF7
cells. Inhibition of PLK1 with volasertib and PLKsiRNA
resulted in a reduction of BCL-xL and JUNB expression in
LTED cells, while these genes were upregulated in parental
MCF7 cells. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that PLK1
inhibition may provide therapeutic beneﬁt to patients with
endocrine-resistant ERþ breast cancer.
RNAi kinome screens have previously identiﬁed PLK1 as a gene
causally associated with growth of basal-like breast cancer and
tumor-initiating cells (35, 45). This ﬁnding may reﬂect a crucial
role of PLK1 in mitosis of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. PLK1
was also recently shown to cooperate with estrogen-dependent

Inhibition of PLK1 decreases BCL2L1 and JUNB expression in LTED cells. A, MCF7 and MCF7/LTED cells were treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or
100 nmol/L volasertib for 24 hours. An ER signaling-speciﬁc PCR array was performed with RNA extracted from these cells. The expression of JUNB and
BCL2L1 was compared between parental and LTED MCF7 cells. B, MCF7 and MCF7/LTED cells were transfected with control or PLK1 siRNA for
48 hours. RNA was extracted and tested in an ER signaling-speciﬁc PCR array. The expression of JUNB and BCL2L1 was compared between the parental

ER signaling (21). In this study, Wierer and colleagues showed
that PLK1 phosphorylates the transcriptional regulator MLL2,
which forms a complex with ER to drive transcription of
tumor-suppressive genes. Those ﬁndings suggest that PLK1 drives
proliferation via its role in interphase but it decreases growth via
its interaction with ER. The ﬁndings in our report herein suggest
that PLK1 has lost this negative cell cycle and transcriptional

PLKs exist in three different isoforms, PLK1, PLK2, and PLK3.
Although PLK1 was shown to signiﬁcantly affect both viability

steady state levels during cell division (46). Volasertib has a high
afﬁnity for PLK1 (0.87 nmol/L), PLK2 (5 nmol/L), and PLK3
(56 nmol/L; ref. 34). Therefore, treatment of antiestrogen-resistant ERþ breast cancer cells with volasertib may have a very potent
effect on growth and ER transcriptional activity by inhibition of
both PLK1 and PLK3.
Blockade of PLK1 with volasertib or siRNA decreased ER
transcriptional activity and ER expression. JUNB, a component
of the AP-1 transcription complex was also decreased upon
inhibition of PLK1 in LTED cell lines and knockdown of JUNB
decreased ER transcriptional activity and expression. It has been
shown that ER can cooperate with AP-1 complexes at AP-I sites to
drive transcription, particularly E2F1 transcription (38, 47). Furthermore, JUNB mRNA and protein expressions have been
reported as poor prognostic biomarkers in patients with ERþ
breast cancer (48). We previously reported that an E2F1 transcriptional signature correlates with a resistance to estrogen deprivation in ERþ breast cancer cells (28). Treatment with volasertib
also reduced expression of BCAR1 (breast cancer antiestrogen
resistance), which encodes p130Cas (Crk-associated substrate;
Supplementary Fig. S5A; ref. 49). BCAR1 overexpression has also
been shown to correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to
tamoxifen in patients with ERþ breast cancer (37). p130Cas
complexes with ER and drives nongenomic signaling such as
activation of c-Src and p85 PI3K (50). We have reported that
hyperactivation of PI3K is causally associated with hormoneindependent growth of ERþ breast cancer cells (15). Moreover,
p130Cas has E2F and c-Jun–binding elements in its promoter.
Taken together, these data suggest that inhibition of PLK1 may
interfere with E2F transcription.
Finally, the combination of volasertib and fulvestrant exhibited
synergistic antitumor efﬁcacy and abrogated ER expression levels
in vivo. Volasertib has currently completed phase I clinical trials
where it showed a favorable pharmacokinetic proﬁle with minor
hematologic toxicities (34). It is under active investigation in
phase II studies addressing efﬁcacy (www.clinicaltrials.gov).
Therefore, based on the two-pronged effect of PLK1 inhibition
on endocrine-resistant ERþ breast cancer cell viability and ER
transcriptional activity, we propose that PLK1 inhibitors like

volasertib should be investigated in patients with ERþ breast
cancer that have escaped estrogen deprivation therapy.
