ABSTRACT
Chemical inhibitors of the checkpoint kinases have shown promise in the
treatment of cancer, yet their clinical utility may be limited by a lack of molecular
biomarkers to identify specific patients most likely to respond to therapy. To this end,
we screened 112 known tumor suppressor genes for synthetic lethal interactions
with inhibitors of the CHEK1 and CHEK2 checkpoint kinases. We identified eight
interactions, including the Replication Factor C (RFC)-related protein RAD17.
Clonogenic assays in RAD17 knockdown cell lines identified a substantial shift in
sensitivity to checkpoint kinase inhibition (3.5-fold) as compared to RAD17 wildtype. Additional evidence for this interaction was found in a large-scale functional
shRNA screen of over 100 genotyped cancer cell lines, in which CHEK1/2 mutant cell
lines were unexpectedly sensitive to RAD17 knockdown. This interaction was widely
conserved, as we found that RAD17 interacts strongly with checkpoint kinases in
the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the setting of RAD17 knockdown,
CHEK1/2 inhibition was found to be synergistic with inhibition of WEE1, another
pharmacologically relevant checkpoint kinase. Accumulation of the DNA damage
marker γH2AX following chemical inhibition or transient knockdown of CHEK1, CHEK2
or WEE1 was magnified by knockdown of RAD17. Taken together, our data suggest
that CHEK1 or WEE1 inhibitors are likely to have greater clinical efficacy in tumors
with RAD17 loss-of-function.

cycle control, targeting the kinases that regulate cell
cycle checkpoints has been proposed as an anti-cancer
therapeutic strategy [2-5]. Currently, ten selective small
molecule inhibitors of the cell-cycle checkpoint kinases
CHEK1, CHEK2, or WEE1 have been tested in clinical

trials, and many more are in preclinical development
[2, 6, 7]. These compounds have shown clinical activity
either in combination with DNA damaging chemotherapy
or as single agents in several tumor types [2, 4, 5,
8-10]. Recently, WEE1 inhibitors have been explored in
combination with CHEK1 and CHEK2 inhibitors [11-13]
and also histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors [14].
It has been proposed that checkpoint kinase
inhibitors may be most active in tumors with defects
in specific aspects of DNA damage repair, including
homologous recombination (HR), the Fanconi Anemia
pathway, or TP53 loss-of-function [15-17]. Nonetheless,
much remains unknown about the genetic predictors of
activity for these compounds. At present, a number of
clinical trials involving checkpoint kinase inhibitors are
underway [2, 18], but these are being performed without
use of biomarker stratification to pre-select patients
most likely to respond to therapy. On the other hand,
the recent report of a remarkable and possibly curative
response to the CHEK1 and CHEK2 (CHEK1/2) inhibitor
AZD7762 in a small-cell tumor with RAD50 mutation
illustrates what is possible when a targeted therapy is
given to a susceptible tumor [19]. This case highlights the
importance of using molecular markers to prospectively
identify patients with susceptible tumors so that they can
be put on effective therapy.
One general strategy for identifying markers of
response to a particular drug is to screen for syntheticlethal genetic interactions with the drug target [20, 21].
Two genes are said to be ‘synthetic lethal’ if simultaneous
disruption of both genes results in cellular death, whereas
independent disruption of either gene is tolerated [22].
Cancers with mutations in tumor suppressor genes (TSG)
that are synthetically lethal with therapeutic targets such
as CHEK1 should be particularly sensitive to inhibition of
that target. Consequently, such mutations become markers
for selection of patients most likely to respond to targeted
therapy. The recent FDA approval of the PARP1 inhibitor
olaparib, specifically for ovarian cancer patients harboring
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, demonstrates the clinical

viability of this strategy [23].
Here, we identify synthetic-lethal genetic
interactions with CHEK1 in order to stratify tumors with
an increased sensitivity to checkpoint kinase inhibition.
We identify the human gene RAD17 Homolog (RAD17) to
be synthetically lethal with both AZD7762 as well as MK1775, an inhibitor of WEE1. When RAD17 expression is
suppressed, the combination of AZD7762 and MK-1775
shows a potent synergistic toxicity associated with a
marked accumulation of γH2AX.

RESULTS
Chemogenetic profiling of AZD7762 identifies
synthetic lethal interactions with RAD17 and
other DNA repair genes
To identify genes with a synthetic lethal relationship
to AZD7762, a chemogenetic screen was performed in
HeLa cells against a panel of 112 known or suspected
TSG (Supplementary Table 1). Each of the 112 TSG
was knocked down with siRNA either in the presence
of AZD7762 (high or low dose) or dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) solvent control. At a stringent cutoff (5 sigma
below mean of non-silencing controls), 8 genes were
identified for synthetic lethal interaction with AZD7762
(Figure 1A). The top four hits (WEE1, CHEK1, CDC6 and
CDC73) were TSGs with well-known functions related
to cell cycle regulation. These included CHEK1 itself, a
direct target of AZD7762, as is typical in chemogenetic
screens [24]. WEE1, another checkpoint kinase known to
complement CHEK1-mediated regulation of cell cycle,
also displayed a strong synthetic lethal interaction with
AZD7762 [11, 12, 25]. Comparing the AZD7762 screen to
a similar chemo-genetic screen with the CHEK1 inhibitor
Gö6976 [16], two of the hits with Gö6976, BRCA2 and
RAD23B also trended towards being synthetically lethal
with AZD7762. Two other hits with Gö6976, HDAC1

and HDAC6 were tested but not found to be synthetically
lethal with AZD7762. Likely the differences in the
AZD7762 and Gö6976 screens is related to inhibition of
kinases other than CHEK1. Gö6976 is known to inhibit
JAK2 [26], which was been reported to be synergistic with
HDAC inhibition [27].
The next four hits with AZD7762 (BLM, RFC1,
RAD17 and FZR1) were all novel interactions involving
TSGs functioning in the DNA damage response. Bloom
syndrome protein (BLM), a RecQ family DNA helicase, is

phosphorylated by both CHEK1 and CHEK2 and is known
to participate in HR, telomere maintenance, and DNA
replication [28, 29]. Germline mutation in BLM is the
cause of Bloom syndrome, a rare disease associated with
cancer predisposition [28]. Fizzy-related protein homolog
(FZR1) activates and regulates substrate specificity of
the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C),
and by doing so is thought to regulate multiple cell cycle
events including G1/G0 maintenance, initiation of DNA
replication and DNA damage response [30]. Replication

Loss-of-function of the tumor suppressor RAD17
is frequent in human cancers

factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) is a DNA-dependent ATPase
known to be involved in clamp loading during DNA
replication and repair [31]. First characterized in the
fission yeast Schizosaccheromyces pombe [32], RAD17
contains DNA binding motifs similar to RFC1 and is
known to be an important sensor of DNA damage and
essential for ATR-mediated cell-cycle arrest in response
to DNA damage [33]. RAD17 localizes to areas of
DNA damage and recruits the MRN complex to Double
Strand Breaks (DSB), promoting HR [34]. In the context
of human cancer, it has been shown that depletion of
RAD17 sensitizes cancer cell lines to DNA damaging
chemotherapy [35], and that down-regulation of RAD17
by certain gain-of-function TP53 mutations leads to the
accumulation of DNA damage [36].

Next, we investigated the incidence of mutation
or homozygous deletion in human tumors for each of
our hits. Query of the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics
[37, 38] indicated that RAD17 is the most frequently
altered of the four TSGs with a pan-cancer incidence of
1.9% (Supplementary Figure 1). RAD17 is frequently
deleted in adenoid cystic carcinoma (13.3%) and prostate
adenocarcinoma (13.1%, 5.9%) and frequently mutated
in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (7.0%) and stomach
adenocarcinoma (4.5%) (Figure 1B and 1C). Mutations
in RAD17 are spread relatively evenly throughout the
681 amino-acid length of the gene, and 10 of the 58
observed mutations (17.2%) are frameshift, nonsense,
or splicing mutations (Figure 1D). This diffuse pattern

and frequency of truncating mutations are consistent
with RAD17 functioning as a TSG [39]. A recent pancancer analysis of all tumor exomes currently included
in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)[40] found somatic
mutations occur in RAD17 at an overall rate of 1.0% and
homozygous deletions at a rate of 0.9%, which, given an
annual incidence of approximately 1.7 million new cancer
cases in the United States [41], equates to over 31,500 new
patients per year with tumors involving RAD17 loss-offunction.

also more sensitive to knockdown of WEE1 (normalized
viability 0.55 vs. 0.96, p < 3.0 x10-8, Figure 1G). These
data in conjunction with the yeast findings suggest that
the interaction between CHEK1/2 and RAD17 is general
to eukaryotic cells and not specific to a particular genetic
background.

CHEK1/2 - RAD17 interaction is conserved across
species and cancer cell lines

To further explore the relationship between RAD17
and the checkpoint kinases, we created stable knockdown
cell lines using lentiviral shRNA constructs targeting
RAD17 in HeLa cells, a human cancer cell line derived
from a cervical adenocarcinoma, as well as LN428,
a human cancer cell line derived from glioblastoma
multiforme [47]. Both cell lines have inactive p53;
HeLa by the effect of human papillomavirus (HPV)
gene E6, and LN428 by somatic mutation. Effectiveness
of gene knockdown was confirmed at the mRNA
level by RT-qPCR, and at the protein level by both
immunofluorescence and western blot (Supplementary
Figure 2). The dual CHEK1/2 inhibitor AZD7762
(chemical structures shown in Supplementary Figure 3)
was significantly more toxic to HeLa cells with RAD17
knockdown relative to non-targeting controls (F-test p <
0.0001, Figure 2A and 2C, Table 1). AZD7762 was also
significantly more toxic to RAD17 knockdowns in LN428
cells (F-test p < 0.0001, Figure 2D, Supplementary Figure
4A). Additionally we performed 2way ANOVA to assess
what portion of the difference in viability was due to
RAD17 knockdown. In HeLa cells 19.5% of the variation
was from RAD17 effect (p < 0.0001) and 13.7% from
interaction between RAD17 effect and dose of drug (p
< 0.0001), for LN428 these percentages were 38.6% and
4.3% respectively (p < 0.0001, Supplemental Table 4). The
WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 was significantly more toxic to
RAD17 knockdowns relative to non-silencing control in
clonogenic assays in both HeLa and LN428 cells (F-test
and ANOVA p < 0.0001, Figure 2B-2E, Supplementary
Figure 4b).
Several structurally distinct checkpoint kinase
inhibitors were tested to determine if the observed
synthetic lethality was an on-target effect. RAD17
knockdown sensitized HeLa cells to the CHEK1 selective
inhibitors MK-8776 and LY2603618 (Supplementary
Figure 4c and d, Table 1). The CHEK2 selective inhibitor
BML-277 also showed greater toxicity to HeLa cells
with RAD17 knockdown, although the magnitude of the
synthetic lethal effect was less than that seen with CHEK1
inhibitors (Supplementary Figure 4e and f). CHEK1,
CHEK2, and WEE1 were also knocked down transiently
using siRNA. The cytotoxic effect of WEE1 knockdown
was significantly greater in LN428/RAD17-KD cells
than controls (26.8% vs. 60.2% normalized viability, p =
0.017, Supplementary Figure 4g). As single knockdowns,

RAD17 functionally interacts with multiple
checkpoint kinases

Given the demonstrated utility of cross-species
modeling for prediction of chemogenetic interactions
[42, 43], we sought to determine if the orthologous genes
to RAD17 and the checkpoint kinases had a syntheticlethal relationship in the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. Sequence alignment was performed to
identify the following best matches: human RAD17 with
scRAD17; human CHEK1 with scCHK1, and human
CHEK2 with scDUN1 (Supplementary Table 2) [44].
These yeast orthologs were tested in a Synthetic Genetic
Array (SGA), in which the rad17Δdun1Δ double knockout
had significantly smaller colonies relative to either single
deletion (Figure 1E). Interestingly, the rad17Δchek1Δ
interaction did not score as a hit in this in this assay. The
rad17Δdun1Δ interaction was further tested in a yeast
spot dilution assay. The double knockout of rad17Δdun1Δ
showed less colony formation relative to either rad17Δ or
dun1Δ single deletion or the wild type stain (Figure 1F),
confirming that rad17Δ and dun1Δ have a synthetic lethal
relationship.
To determine if the interaction between CHEK1/2
and RAD17 was also present across a diverse set of
cancer cell lines we analyzed data generated from Project
Achilles, a cancer cell-line based functional genomic
screen in which over 11,000 genes were knocked down
with shRNA in 102 cell lines [45]. Since the majority of
these 102 cells lines were profiled for mutations at panel of
1651 genes as part of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
(CCLE) [46] we were able to identify 10 of the 102 as
having either mutation or homozygous deletion of CHEK1
or CHEK2. Of note, none of the cell lines had RAD17
homozygous deletion, and RAD17 mutation status was
not assessed in this dataset. We found that cell lines with
disruption of CHEK1/2 had significantly greater sensitivity
to shRNA mediated knockdown of RAD17 relative to cell
lines without CHEK1/2 alteration (normalized viability
0.73 vs. 1.0, p < 0.0003, Figure 1G). Two of the three cell
lines most sensitive to RAD17 knockdown were GP2D and
LS411N, both colon cancer cell lines harboring CHEK1
mutation. The other top hit was Colo704, an ovarian
cancer cell line with homozygous deletion of CHEK2
(Supplementary Table 3). CHEK1/2 altered cell lines were

both CHEK1 and CHEK2 had a mild effect on viability,
trending towards RAD17 knockdowns being more
sensitive. LN428/RAD17-KD cells were significantly
more sensitive to simultaneous knockdown of CHEK1
and CHEK2 than LN428/SCR control (50.9% vs. 89.6%
normalized viability, p = 0.011, Supplementary Figure
4g). Overall, these results demonstrate that RAD17 has a
synthetic lethal relationship with each of the checkpoint
kinases CHEK1, CHEK2, and WEE1.

with RAD17 knockdown. Indeed, the combination of
AZD7762 with an equal dose of MK-1775 was more
toxic to RAD17 knockdown cells than non-silencing
controls in both HeLa (F-test and ANOVA p < 0.0001,
Figure 3a) and LN428 cells (F-test and ANOVA p <
0.0001, Figure 3B). The absolute IC50 concentration
was approximately four-fold lower for the combination
relative to the IC50 concentrations of either AZD7762 or
MK-1775 alone (Table 1). However, the magnitude of
the synthetic lethal effect, that is the ratio of wild type
IC50 to RAD17 knockdown IC50, was essentially the same
for the combination relative to either single molecule.
The combination of AZD7762 with MK-1775 was
synergistic in both RAD17 knockdown cell lines but not
in non-silencing controls for all doses tested (Figure 3C).
Additionally we tested the ATR inhibitor VX-970, which
is currently in Phase I/II clinical testing in combination
with topotecan [50]. RAD17 knockdown sensitized
both HeLa and LN428 cells to VX-970, reducing IC50
by approximately 3 fold (F-test and ANOVA p < 0.005,

Combined CHEK1/2 and WEE1 inhibition causes
synergistic toxicity in the setting of RAD17 lossof-function
Given prior reports of synergy between CHEK1
and WEE1 inhibitors in lymphoma [48], leukemia
[11], and solid tumor [12, 49] cell lines, we suspected
that simultaneous inhibition of CHEK1 and WEE1
might further magnify the synthetic lethal effect

RAD17 synthetic lethal effect with checkpoint
kinases is associated with increase in γH2AX
accumulation

Supplemental Figure 5a and b). The combination of
AZD7762 with VX-970 was also more potent in HeLa
cells with RAD17 knockdown (F-test and ANOVA p
< 0.0001, Supplemental Figure 5c). Interestingly, the
combination of AZD7762 with VX-970 was synergistic in
both HeLa cells with RAD17 knockdown as well as nontargeting controls (Supplementary Figure 5d).
Given that evidence of forced mitotic entry has been
observed as soon as 8 hours after treatment with WEE1
inhibitors [13], we suspected that transient CHEK1/2WEE1 inhibition would be sufficient to kill RAD17
knockdown cells. A pulse-dose exposure of AZD7762 with
MK-1775 for 72 hours was only slightly less toxic than
continuous exposure and again demonstrated a synthetic
lethal effect with RAD17 knockdown (Figure 3D). This
suggests that intermittent dosing of CHEK1 or WEE1
inhibitors could be a viable therapeutic strategy in certain
susceptible tumors.

RAD17 is known to participate in cell cycle
regulation by activating the S-phase checkpoint [51]
in addition to its role in DNA damage repair [34]. We
sought to determine which function was mediating the
observed synthetic lethal effect with checkpoint kinase
inhibition using a high-throughput immunofluorescence
assay to measure phosphorylation of histone H2AX at
Ser139 (γH2AX), an established marker of DNA damage
[52]. It has previously been reported that inhibition of
CHEK1 or WEE1 causes accumulation of γH2AX [2,
7, 12]. We found that chemical inhibition of CHEK1/2
with AZD7762 resulted in a dose dependent increase in
γH2AX, with significantly greater induction of γH2AX
seen in RAD17 knockdown samples relative to nonsilencing controls in both HeLa (p < 0.05, Figure 4A)
and LN428 cell lines (p < 0.05, Supplementary Figure
6a). Similarly, WEE1 inhibition with MK-1775 also
resulted in a dose dependent increase in γH2AX with
significantly greater induction of γH2AX seen in RAD17

Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) assay. The addition of the
combination of AZD7762 and MK-1775 resulted in greater
accumulation of γH2AX in RAD17 knockdown cells,
consistent with the results of the immunofluorescence
assay (Figure 4D-4G, Supplementary Figure 6b-d). The
observation that loss-of-function of RAD17 exacerbates
the γH2AX accumulation seen with CHEK1 or WEE1
inhibition suggests that RAD17’s role in DNA repair is at
least partially independent of the checkpoint kinases.
To evaluate the effect of RAD17 knockdown on
cell cycle progression we performed FACS. In contrast
to its effect on γH2AX accumulation, RAD17 knockdown
had minimal effect on progression through the G1-S or
G2/M checkpoints. In LN428 and HeLa cells a dosedependent accumulation of cells in the S or G2 phase was
seen with AZD7762, MK-1775, and the combination of
AZD7762 and MK-1775 (Figure 5A-5C, Supplementary
Figure 6e-g). However, the accumulation of cells in S or
G2 phase was not increased by the knockdown of RAD17
in the absence of checkpoint kinase inhibition (Figure
5D), or at doses near the IC50 concentration for these
compounds (Figure 5E). At a dose of 200 nM, more than
three times the IC50 for LN428/RAD17-KD1 cells or six
times the IC50 for LN428/RAD17-KD2 cells, there was a
greater percentage of cells in S or G2 phase in the RAD17
knockdown cell lines relative to non-silencing control
(Figure 5F). Similar results were seen in HeLa cells

knockdown samples in both HeLa and LN428 cell lines
(p < 0.05, Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure 6a).
Similar to its effect in clonogenic assay, the combination
of both AZD7762 and MK-1775 was more potent than
either single agent in terms of induction of γH2AX. The
increase in γH2AX seen with combined treatment was
greater in the setting of RAD17 knockdown (p < 0.05,
Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure 6a). The CHEK1
selective inhibitors MK-8776, CHIR-124, and LY2603618
also increased γH2AX accumulation to a greater degree
in cells with RAD17 knockdown (p < 0.05, Figure 4B).
The CHEK2 selective inhibitor BML-277 induced less
γH2AX than the CHEK1 inhibitors, but more γH2AX
was observed in RAD17 knockdown cells relative to
non-silencing controls (p < 0.05, Figure 4B). Transient
knockdown of CHEK1, CHEK2, and WEE1 produced
results similar to chemical inhibitors. Knockdown of
either CHEK1 or WEE1 led to significantly more γH2AX
accumulation in RAD17 knockdown cells (p < 0.05, Figure
4C), however this effect was not seen with knockdown
of CHEK2. These results confirm that the increase in
γH2AX accumulation seen with AZD7762 and MK-1775
is due to the on-target effect of inhibition of CHEK1/2 or
WEE1, respectively, and suggest the effect of AZD7762 is
mediated primarily through inhibition of CHEK1.

in TCGA. Tumors with RAD17 homozygous deletion or
mutation had significantly increased expression of both
CHEK1 and CHEK2 relative to tumors without RAD17
alteration (Mann-Whitney U test p = 1.0e-7 and 0.0017,
respectively), with WEE1 there was a non-significant
trend toward increased expression (Figure 6A-6C). Given
the overlapping roles of RAD17 and the checkpoint
kinases in repairing DNA damage we suspected that the
observed overexpression of CHEK1, CHEK2 and WEE1
was a compensatory mechanism to prevent excessive
DNA damage. To evaluate if this overexpression of
checkpoint kinases is potentially clinically relevant,
we next looked for an association with patient survival.
At an overexpression cutoff of two sigma, the majority
of TCGA patients had none of the three checkpoint
kinases (CHEK1, CHEK2 and WEE1) overexpressed.
These patients had the best overall survival, and as the
number of overexpressed checkpoint kinases increased,
overall survival became progressively worse (Figure 6D).
The number of checkpoint kinases overexpressed was
significantly associated with survival as assessed by a Cox
proportional hazards model (p < 0.003 without covariates,
p < 0.008 with covariates age, stage, tumor type). The

(Supplementary Figure 6h-j). These data suggest that in
the setting of RAD17 knockdown cells continue to cycle
normally. The fact that cytotoxic doses of AZD7762 and
MK-1775 do not cause accumulation of cells in S or G2
phase with or without RAD17 indicates that loss of cell
cycle regulation is not the primary mechanism causing
cell death. This result is consistent with prior reports that
WEE1 or CHEK1 inhibition can ultimately cause cell
death by mitotic catastrophe [53, 54].

Interaction of RAD17 and checkpoint kinases in
primary human tumor samples
It has been demonstrated that co-disruption of
synthetic lethal partners in a tumor is associated with
better patient survival [55], presumably because these
tumors are less robust to perturbations and thus more
vulnerable to therapy. To assess whether there is evidence
of interaction between RAD17 and the checkpoint kinases
in primary human tumors, we examined somatic mutation,
copy number variation, and mRNA expression data from
~8000 biopsy specimens spanning multiple cancer types

[22]. Given that CHEK1, CHEK2, and WEE1 play a role
in the repair of DNA damage in addition to regulating
cell cycle checkpoints [2, 18, 57], we suspected that the
interaction with RAD17 would involve one or both of
these two functions. Our results suggest that it the role of
RAD17 in DNA damage repair, likely the recruitment of
the MRN complex to DSB, which becomes essential in the
setting of checkpoint kinase inhibition. This conclusion
is supported by prior data in HeLa cells identifying that
claspin-dependent activation of CHEK1 is independent of
RAD17 [58].
Although the compound AZD7762, which inhibits
both CHEK1 and CHEK2, is no longer in clinical
development due to cardiac toxicity [9], other selective
inhibitors of CHEK1 including MK-8776 remain in
clinical development. It is unknown if the cardiac issues
seen with AZD7762 relate to dual CHEK1/2 inhibition or
an off-target effect; regardless, our data on the selective
CHEK1 inhibitors MK-8776, LY2603618, and CHIR-124
suggest that CHEK1 inhibition is sufficient to achieve a
synthetic lethal interaction with RAD17 loss-of-function.
The selective CHEK1 inhibitors were not tried in
combination with WEE1 inhibition in this study, but given
a prior report of synergy between MK-8776 and MK-1775
in the majority of a set of 39 cancer cell lines [12], it is
likely that a CHEK1 selective inhibitor would perform
similarly to AZD7762 when combined with MK-1775 in
the setting of RAD17 loss-of-function. The combination
of CHEK1 inhibitor and WEE1 inhibitor shows particular
promise in RAD17 mutant or deleted tumors, as the IC50
of these drugs in combination is four-fold lower than that
of each drug individually. The fact that only a pulse-dose
of CHEK1 and WEE1 inhibition was needed to achieve a
synthetic lethal effect in RAD17 knockdown cells suggests
the possibility that this combination could be used as
a long term maintenance therapy, free of traditional
cytotoxic chemotherapy.

proportion of patients alive at five years ranged from 62%
for those with no checkpoint kinase overexpression to 0%
for the 24 patients overexpressing all three checkpoint
kinases (Figure 6E). These results suggest that the
synthetic lethal effect observed between RAD17 and the
checkpoint kinases in vitro may be functionally relevant
in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Small molecule inhibitors of either CHEK1 or
WEE1 remain in clinical development, both as single
agents and in combination with either DNA damaging or
anti-metabolite chemotherapy [2, 4, 7]. Currently, these
early phase trials are being performed without biomarker
stratification due in part to a poor understanding of the
molecular predictors of response to these therapies. Prior
in vitro testing of CHEK1 inhibitors has found that only
10-15% of cancer cell lines are sensitive to isolated
CHEK1 inhibition [56]. Assuming these cell lines are a
reasonable surrogate for human tumors, it suggests that
for each patient with a tumor sensitive to checkpoint
kinase inhibition, as many as nine patients with resistant
tumors will be treated with ineffective therapy. To address
this need we identified several TSG involved in either
DNA repair or cell cycle regulation to be synthetically
lethal with the checkpoint kinase inhibitor AZD7762.
Focusing on RAD17, we show in clonogenic assay that
shRNA mediated knockdown of RAD17 increases the
sensitivity of either HeLa or LN428 cancer cells to both
chemical inhibition or siRNA mediated knockdown of the
checkpoint kinases CHEK1, CHEK2 and WEE1. Evidence
of the interaction between RAD17 and CHEK1/2 was also
seen in a functional genomic screen involving a panel of
over 100 cell lines and in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae.
The presence of a strong conserved genetic
interaction between RAD17 and the checkpoint kinases
in human and yeast species separated by up to a billion
years of evolution [22], suggests that this functional
relationship is not just active in some conditions or cell
states but may be fundamental for eukaryotic life. This
supposition is supported by the fact that (excluding hypermutated tumors) there are no occurrences of tumors with
mutations in both RAD17 and either CHEK1, CHEK2
and WEE1 across all cancer types in TCGA. We suspect
that the observed overexpression of CHEK1, CHEK2 and
WEE1 in tumors with RAD17 deletion or mutation is a
compensatory response to impaired DNA damage repair.
Tumors that overexpress checkpoint kinases should
have greater fitness than those without compensatory
overexpression, resulting in worse clinical outcomes for
these patients, as we observed.
Synthetic lethal interactions are predicted to occur
between genes that participate in independent, but
complementary pathways, such as base excision repair
and HR for the synthetic lethal pair PARP1 and BRCA1

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemo-genetic screen
A dose-response curve for AZD7762 in HeLa cells
was created prior to screening. HeLa cells were seeded at
density of 500 cells per well in 384 well plates, after 72
hours of drug exposure viability was measured using the
Cell Titer Glow (Promega) viability regent. Prism v6.05
(GraphPad Software) was used to fit non-linear regression
to create a dose-response curve which determined IC20
(0.22 µM) and IC40 (0.4 µM) doses. For the chemogenetic screen cells were transfected by wet reverse
method using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies). Each
gene was targeted by four individual siRNA constructs
pooled in the same well; three replicates were performed
35764

on separate plates for each dose. Correlation of replicates
was 0.97 indicating excellent reproducibility (Figure
S1B-D). Synthetic lethal interactions were scored by first
normalizing for the viability effect of gene knockdown in
the presence of only dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent,
then comparing these normalized values for each gene
to panel of non-silencing controls to determine Z-score.
Since the Z-scores for the IC20 and IC40 doses were highly
correlated (r = 0.87, p < 0.0001, Figure S1A) they were
averaged to create a single value for each of the 112 genes
screened.

at 32˚C and then cultured for 8 hours at 37˚C. Next, the
cells were transduced a second time at 32˚C for 18 hours
with the lentiviruses containing the same shRNA, and
then cultured for 24 hours at 37˚C. Cells were selected
by culturing in growth media with 1.0 μg/mL puromycin
for two weeks to obtain stable knockdown cells. For each
gene, five individual shRNAs targeting each gene were
used to generate five independent knockdown cell lines.
The cell lines with the highest level of knockdown were
selected for future studies.

Determination of gene knockdown level (RTqPCR)

cBioPortal analysis
Data from all available cohorts on cBioPortal (www.
cbioportal.org) excluding cell lines was last downloaded
on 6/1/15.

Gene expression (mRNA) was measured by
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) using
an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus system. Briefly,
80,000 cells were lysed and reverse transcribed using
the Taqman Gene Expression Cells-to-CT kit (Applied
Biosystems). Each sample was analyzed in duplicate
using a Taqman Gene Expression Assay for human RAD17
(Hs00607830_m1) and normalized to the expression of
human β-actin (Applied Biosystems). Expression (mRNA)
was analyzed via the ΔΔCT method, results are reported as
an average of two analyses +/- SE.

Sequence alignment
The online version of Clustal W, version 2.1 was
used to perform sequence alignment.

Yeast spot dilution and synthetic genetic array
assay

Determination of gene knockdown
(Immunofluorescence and western blot)

Yeast mutant strains were constructed by the pinning
robot ROTOR (Singer Instruments) using SGA technology
[59]. Colony sizes were quantified and normalized using
Colony Analyzer to assess viability [60]. For spot dilution
assays, cells were grown to mid-log in rich media (YPAD).
Aliquots of 10-fold serial dilutions were spotted on rich
media (YPAD) and grown for 2 days at 30 ˚C.

Cells were seeded into clear bottom 384 well plates
(Nunc), fixed with 4% formaldehyde, blocked with 2%
bovine serum albumin in TBST, and stained with Hoechst
and anti-RAD17 (Abnova) primary antibody followed
by Alexa594 donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody.
Plates were imaged with ImageXpress Micro automated
epi-fluorescent microscope (Molecular Devices) and
images were scored with MetaExpress analysis software
(Molecular Devices). For western blot cells were lysed
with RIPA buffer and prepared for SDS-PAGE using
NuPAGE kit (Invitrogen). Same anti-RAD17 (Abnova)
primary antibody was used as in immunofluorescence
assays.

Project achilles analysis
Raw shRNA viability data was downloaded from
Cheung et al, 2011 [45]. Viability for each gene was
determined by averaging the values of five independent
constructs.

Generation of lentiviral knockdown cell lines

Clonogenic assays

The shuttle vectors for expression of shRNA
targeting each gene were purchased from Sigma (St.
Louis, MO). Lentiviruses were prepared in collaboration
with the UPCI Lentiviral facility. Lentiviral particles
were generated by co-transfection of 4 plasmids (the
shuttle vector plus three packaging plasmids: pMD2.g
(VSVG), pVSV-REV and PMDLg/pRRE) into 293-FT
cells using FuGene 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche).
10,000 cells were seeded into a 6-well plate 24 hours
before transduction. Cells were transduced for 18 hours

level

Cells were counted using Scepter automated cell
counter (Millipore) and between 800-2000 cells were
seeded per plate. Cells were treated with small molecule
inhibitors or DMSO solvent control for 9 days (HeLa) or
10 days (LN428). Consistent with standard protocol a cut
off of 50 cell was used as threshold to define a colony
[61]. Canon Rebel T3i digital camera was used to create
a digital image of each plate, colonies were then scored
using a custom Matlab script calibrated against manually

TCGA analysis

counted control plates for each cell line. Number of
colonies per plates was normalized to number of colonies
on plates treated only with DMSO solvent, each lentiviral
modified cell line was normalized independently. IC50
concentrations were determined by performing four
parameter non-linear regression using Prism v6.05
software. IC50 concentrations compared to each other using
extra sum-of-squares F test. Pulse-dose experiments were
performed by exchanging media to remove drugs after 72
hours of exposure with colony formation measured after
an additional seven additional days of growth. The method
of Chou and Talalay was used to measure synergistic
effects of drug combination [62].

Data for TCGA cohort were obtained from the
Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC) Firehose website,
latest data were downloaded from the 4/2/15 standard data
and analyses run.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

250-500 cells were seeded into clear bottom 384
well plates (Nunc) and treated with either siRNA, kinase
inhibitors, or controls. After incubation with either siRNA
or small molecule inhibitor for 48-72 hours cells were
fixed with 4% formaldehyde, blocked with 2% bovine

400,000 - 500,000 cells were plated in 10 cm
dishes and allow to attach overnight before being treated
with small molecules the next day. After 48 hrs of drug
exposure cells were harvested by incubating with trypsin
for 5 min. Trypsin was neutralized with serum containing
media and then cells were pelleted and re-suspended in
ice cold 70% ETOH and stored at -20 C. On day of FACS
run cells were washed once with PBS and incubated with
FITC conjugated anti- γ-H2AX antibody (Millipore)
per manufacturer protocol. Cells were then suspended
in DNA staining buffer (Sodium citrate 0.1%, Triton-X
100 0.3%, propridium iodide 0.1 mg/mL, ribonuclease A
0.2 mg/mL in distilled water) and run on FACS machine
(B&D LSRII, BD Biosciences). FACS data was analyzed
with FlowJo v10.0.8 (Tree Star, Inc). Cell cycle analysis
was performed using the Watson (univariate) method
with constraint of equal CV for 2N and 4N peaks [63].
At baseline, approximately 40% of cells were in S or G2
phase for both RAD17-KD and non-silencing cell lines in
both the HeLa and LN428 background.
