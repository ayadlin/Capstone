toward Adoptive Immunotherapy after Cord
Blood Transplantation

Abstract
Donor leukocyte infusions (DLI) in the allogeneic hematopoietic transplant setting can provide a clinically
relevant boost of immunity to reduce opportunistic infections and to increase graft-versus-leukemia activity.
Despite significant advances in applicability, DLI has not been available for single-unit recipients of unrelated
cord blood transplant. Ex vivo expansion of cord blood T cells can be achieved with interleukin (IL)-2 and
CD3/CD28 costimulatory beads. However, significant apoptosis occurs in proliferating T cells, diminishing
the yield and skewing the CD4/CD8 ratio in the T-cell population, jeopardizing the potential efficacy of
DLI. In this study, we show that interleukin (IL)-7 not only reduces apoptosis of activated T lymphocytes
and enhances their proliferation but also promotes functional maturation, leading to secretion of IFN-γ
and other key cytokines. Recognizing that infused T lymphocytes will need to meet microbial antigens in secondary lymphoid organs to generate effectors, we also show that expansion with IL-7 promotes the preservation of a polyclonal broad T-cell receptor repertoire and a surface phenotype that favors lymph node homing.
Expanded lymphocytes lack alloreactivity against recipient and other allogeneic cells, indicating a favorable
safety profile from graft-versus-host disease. Nevertheless, expanded T cells can be primed subsequently
against lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cells to generate tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells. Taken together,
our findings offer a major step in fulfilling critical numerical and biological requirements to quickly generate
a DLI product ex vivo using a negligible fraction of a cord blood graft that provides a flexible adoptive immunotherapy platform for both children and adults. Cancer Res; 70(13); 5249–58. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Lymphopenia, particularly affecting T cells, is an almost
uniform consequence of hematopoietic cell transplantation
extending sometimes beyond the first year. Adoptive transfer
of naturally primed and ex vivo restimulated T lymphocytes
in the form of donor leukocyte infusions (DLI) has shown
efficacy to prevent/treat EBV-associated lymphomas and
posttransplant viral infections (1) and could augment graftversus-leukemia (GVL) activity. Despite significant recent

advances in the applicability and outcome following unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT), currently there is no
obviously available posttransplant source for DLI from the
transplanted unit. Not only is there a shortage of leukocytes
available for DLI but cord blood T lymphocytes are also antigen inexperienced/naïve cells. Moreover, multiple placental
factors bias against Th1/Tc1 development in utero (2, 3), impairing Th1/Tc1 cytokine production, particularly IFN-γ (4)
and cytotoxicity (5), collectively leading to impaired antiviral
immunity that leads to significant transplant-related mortality in the first 3 to 6 months after UCBT (reviewed in ref. 6).
The tempo of cellular recovery is quite variable after UCBT.
Although mitogenic responses may reach reference range in
children 6 to 9 months after UCBT, T-cell reconstitution is
gradual and typically does not reach age-appropriate numbers before 9 to 12 months. This is in contrast with adults
where T-cell reconstitution typically extends beyond the first
year, presumably as a result from age-dependent decline in
pretransplant thymic function (7). A detailed analysis in a
cohort of adults who underwent UCBT for hematologic
malignancies showed extremely severe T-cell lymphopenia
that extended throughout the first year (8).
Attaining a vigorous cellular immune profile, particularly
against common pathogens such as herpes viruses, affects
survival after UCBT. Investigators from the Cord Blood

Transplantation Study found that development of antigenspecific proliferation in the first 3 years to cytomegalovirus
(CMV), herpes simplex virus, or VZV led to a lower probability of leukemia relapse and a higher overall survival (9). Robust proliferative T-cell responses likely represent a powerful
surrogate marker for functional T-cell immune reconstitution, leading to more effective GVL activity. These data
underscore the high clinical relevance to design novel approaches aimed at alleviating posttransplant lymphopenia
and the Th1/Tc1 functional deficits displayed by cord blood
T cells infused in the graft.
Recently, we and others have shown the feasibility of ex vivo
cord blood T-cell expansion (10, 11), drawing from the pioneering work by June and colleagues (12), using paramagnetic
Dynal beads coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulatory
antibodies. These artificial antigen-presenting cells (APC)
simultaneously provide agonistic T-cell receptor (TCR) and
costimulatory signals triggering sufficient T-cell proliferation
in vitro to generate clinically relevant DLI products from living donors (13–15). Although in our previous work (10) robust
T-cell expansion and even partial Th1/Tc1 maturation were
evident starting with frozen/thawed cord blood specimens,
significant apoptosis (∼16%) resulted in an inverted CD4/
CD8 ratio and diminished yield despite relatively low concentrations of interleukin (IL)-2 in the medium. The high degree
of apoptosis was likely the result of activation-induced cell
death (AICD) following strong TCR signaling on cord blood
T cells as previously described (16). Infusion of overstimulated, apoptosis-prone DLI product would likely lead to a narrow T-cell repertoire and shortened T-cell survival in vivo.
Moreover, it could falsely suggest futility of ex vivo expanded
DLI strategies.
In the current study, we tested and confirmed our hypotheses that IL-7, acting in concert with a new clinical-grade CD3/
CD28 costimulatory bead and IL-2, would not only enhance
ex vivo cord blood T-cell proliferation while retaining a broad
TCR repertoire as predicted (17) but would also reduce AICD.
We also show that IL-7 permits Th1/Tc1 maturation of the
proliferating cord blood T cells to progress until a clinically
desired intermediate state while preserving the naïve surface
phenotype of the starting population conducive to lymph
node homing. The absence of cytotoxicity against recipient
and other allogeneic cells indicates a favorable safety profile
from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Importantly, expanded CD3/CD28-expanded T cells can be subsequently primed
against lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cells to generate
tumor-specific CTL. Taken together, the presented experimental strategies for the first time fulfill critical numerical
and biological requirements to generate a DLI product
ex vivo in ∼14 days from a negligible (≤3%) fraction of a cord
blood graft, offering a flexible adoptive immunotherapy platform for pediatric as well as adult clinical trials.

Materials and Methods
Specimens
Frozen umbilical cord blood samples not eligible for clinical use were obtained from research units at the Duke Stem

5250

Cancer Res; 70(13) July 1, 2010

Cell Laboratory. Eligible patients were consented on an Institutional Review Board–approved protocol to obtain fibroblasts and ≤3% aliquots of their UCB grafts.
T-cell enrichment and expansion system
CD3+ T cells were enriched by negative immunomagnetic
selection with EasySep (StemCell Technology) as described
(10). Expansion was started at 6 × 105 to 8 × 105 T cells/mL
in gas-permeable VueLifeTeflon bags (American Fluoroseal).
T cells were cocultured with ClinExVivo Dynabeads (Dynal/
Invitrogen Corp.) at a cell/bead ratio of 3:1 in X Vivo-15
(BioWhittacker) supplemented with 5.5 × 10 −5 mol/L βmercaptoethanol, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 5% pooled human serum (Valley Biomedical), and 100 units/mL IL-2 (Proleukin,
Novartis) ± 10 ng/mL IL-7 (R&D Systems) as indicated.
Medium and cytokines were replenished three times a week
to maintain a cell concentration of ∼1 × 106 total nucleated
cell count/mL (10). After 12 to 14 days, after vigorous agitation,
the beads were removed by a Dynal magnet MPC-2 or Dynal
ClinExVivo MPC.
Immunophenotypic and functional characterization
of the CD3/CD28-expanded T cells
Surface and intracellular immunophenotyping, cytokine
secretion, and T-cell enumeration were performed by fourcolor fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) as described
(10, 18, 19). Acquisition of >5,000 CD3+ events was performed
on FACSCalibur or FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences). All antibodies, including isotype-specific controls, were purchased
from BD Biosciences, except anti–granzyme B, which was
from Serotec. Cytotoxicity was measured against IM9 cell
line (20) or recipient fibroblasts by Delfia EuTDA cytotoxicity
assay on a Victor 2 microplate reader (both from PerkinElmer). Following 7 to 9 days of prestimulation with mitomycin C–treated targets (100 μg/mL; Sigma) in the presence
of IL-7 (5 ng/mL) and IL-2 (25 units/mL), effectors were
washed and cultured in serial dilution with 5,000 fresh
untreated targets for 2 and 3 hours. Percent specific europium chelated ligand (EuTDA) release was calculated as
follows: [experimental release (counts) − spontaneous release
(counts)]/[maximum release (counts) − spontaneous release
(counts)] × 100. Percent spontaneous release = [spontaneous
release (counts) − background (counts)]/[maximum release
(counts) − background (counts)] × 100.
TCRVβ spectratyping and Kullback-Leibler divergence
analysis were performed as previously published (21).
Leukemia-specific CTL generation from CD3/CD28expanded cultures
CD3/CD28-expanded “day 14” T cells generated from cord
blood grafts were cultured in parallel with two different
mitomycin C–treated leukemia cells (IM9 and U937) at a
stimulator/responder ratio of 1:10 in 24-well plates (Costar)
at ∼1 × 106 cells/mL. IM9 leukemia cell line represents a lymphoid malignancy (20), whereas U937 monoblastoid leukemia cells are of myeloid origin (22). CTLs were cultured in
X Vivo-15 medium (Lonza) supplemented with 5% FCS (Life
Technologies, Invitrogen), 5 ng/mL IL-7, 5 ng/mL IL-15, and

IL-7 Promotes Cord Blood T-Cell Expansion

10 ng/mL IL-12 (all from R&D Systems) for 9 to 10 days. U937
cells were treated in vitro with IFN-γ (R&D Systems) at
500 units/mL for ∼48 hours before mitomycin C treatment
to enhance their immunogenicity. Cultures were restimulated with mitomycin C–treated leukemia cells twice: first
in the presence of IL-7 and IL-15 and second with IL-15
alone, each for 6 to 7 days. CTL cultures were refed with medium alone after half the medium was removed the night before culture termination. Washed effectors were tested in
Delfia EuTDA cytotoxicity assay as described above against
fresh, unmanipulated BATDA-loaded targets that included
IM9 and U937 leukemia cells and phytohemagglutinin
(PHA) blasts of the cord blood transplant recipient. Percent
specific EuTDA release was calculated as described above.
Analysis of human TRC gene rearrangement
The signal-joint TCR excision circle (sjTREC) assay was
performed using real-time quantitative PCR by quantifying
the episomal circles generated as a by-product of TCRα gene
rearrangement as we previously published (7). For each cell
suspension prepared for TREC analysis, total nucleated cell
count and absolute T cell content were enumerated by Trucount FACS as previously described (10, 18), and thereafter,
dry pellets were prepared and kept frozen at −80°C until
batch-matched pairs were thawed. TREC content was
expressed after adjustment for 105 T cells per sample.
Statistical analysis
Two-sided paired Student's t test was used to compare conditions ± IL-7 and to compare T-cell cytotoxicity against the
described targets. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

Results
Favorable effect of IL-7 on cord blood T-cell survival,
proliferation, and TCRVβ repertoire during
CD3/CD28-mediated expansion
Purified T cells obtained from frozen/thawed cord blood
specimens were split and cultured in parallel with and without IL-7. Matched pair analysis showed significantly more viable T cells when IL-7 was added to IL-2 in the medium,
leading to an average of 165-fold T-cell expansion (Table 1;
Fig. 1A). Following 14 days of expansion, striking dilution of
TRECs was noted as the sjTREC content in CD3+ T cells was
depleted by ∼2 log in both culture conditions compared with
the starting population of pre-expansion cord blood T cells
(Fig. 1B), irrespective of IL-7 exposure. There was no significant difference in trypan blue viability between the culture
conditions, typically >85% by days 12 to 14. This was in stark
contrast once cellular events at the end of 12 to 14 days of
culture were examined by flow cytometry. Significantly more
viable CD45 bright T lymphocytes were identified in cultures
supplanted with IL-7 (71 ± 10%) compared with cultures with
IL-2 alone (mean, 46 ± 15%; Fig. 2A; Table 1). CD3/CD28costimulated lymphocytes that have recently undergone
apoptosis can be accurately enumerated with the aid of a simple flow cytometry gating strategy (10). Recently apoptotic/
dead cells display altered physical properties, as defined by

forward scatter/side scatter, additionally stain less intensely
with CD45 (and CD3) compared with “viable” lymphocytes
(Fig. 3A). We also tracked T cells that have recently entered
the apoptosis pathway, identified/gated in the viable CD45/
FSC/SSC region by intracellular expression of activated caspase-3 (Fig. 2C) and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD)/Annexin
stain (Fig. 3B). As determined by intracellular activated caspase-3 expression, there were significantly fewer T cells undergoing active apoptosis in the presence of IL-7 (median, 4%
versus 8%; Table 1; Fig. 2C). The antiapoptotic effect if IL-7
was evident in both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets (Table 1). To test
T-cell survival-promoting effects of IL-7 beyond the in vitro
expansion period, expanded cells were frozen on day 14
and subsequently thawed and rested for 24 hours in culture
medium devoid of cytokines. Although the rest period in vitro
cannot mimic the in vivo postinfusion conditions exactly,
these experiments show that T cells after expansion retain
the potential to upregulate IL-7 receptor/CD127 (Fig. 3A),
and that the majority of IL-7 + IL-2–expanded T cells are still
alive after freeze, thaw, and 24-hour culture in medium (Fig.
3B). Independent of the described antiapoptotic effects, IL-7
promoted significantly greater T-cell proliferation. About two
thirds of all T cells were still actively cycling at the termination of the expansion period, as detected by intracellular Ki67
expression (Fig. 2B; Table 1). Because naïve T cells with recent
thymic emigrant (RTE) phenotype (CD28+/CD27+CD45RA+/
CD62L+) represent the vast majority of unmanipulated cord
blood T cells, these findings corroborate earlier studies showing the proliferative and antiapoptotic effects of IL-7 to be
operational predominantly in the naïve/CD45RA+ T-cell compartment (17, 23). In addition to superior T-cell proliferation
and reduced apoptosis in IL-7 supplanted conditions, we also
found higher TCRVβ diversity per family (P = 0.04, n = 3), displaying a broad polyclonal spectrum (Fig. 4).
Limited Th1/Tc1 “maturation” during expansion and
low expression levels of 4-1BB/CD137, CD40L, and
perforin correlate with absent alloreactivity
Once we had shown the salutary effects of IL-7 on T-cell
viability, expansion, and overall TCR diversity, we sought to
determine its effect on surface and intracellular phenotype
and overall T-cell function as measured by cytokine secretion
profile and cytotoxicity. Despite undergoing several cycles of
cell division triggered by IL-2 + IL-7 in concert with TCR and
CD28 costimulation, significantly more cord blood T cells retained the naïve starting phenotype, CD45RA+/CD62L+, in the
IL-7–containing condition (90 ± 5%) compared with cells cultured in IL-2 alone (73 ± 14%; P = 0.03; Fig. 2D). Surface expression of L-selectin (CD62L) is essential for effective T-cell
homing to secondary lymphoid organs, a desired destination
for antigen inexperienced, unprimed adoptive T-cell infusions. CCR-7, a chemokine receptor implicated in both the
entry and the retaining of T cells in lymph nodes, was also
expressed on the majority of expanded T cells (data not
shown). Interestingly, although the surface of postexpansion
T cells seemed identical to unmanipulated fresh cord blood T
cells in terms of CD28+/CD27+/CD45RA+/CD62L coexpression, expanded T cells displayed several upregulated surface

“receptor switching process” is not dependent on the presence of IL-7 in our cultures, as CD25 and CD127 expression
levels were superimposable in the presence and absence of
IL-7 (Fig. 3A). Moreover, because a near-complete reversal
between CD25 and CD127 expression has occurred by ∼24
to 48 hours of culture (Fig. 3A), this phenomenon seems independent of cell division. Numerical T-cell expansion does
not begin in earnest in the cultures until days −3 to 4 (Fig. 1;

data not shown). Interestingly, when expanded T cells
were frozen on day 14 and subsequently thawed and rested
for 24 hours in culture medium devoid of cytokines, CD127
was reexpressed on nearly half of the viable T cells (Fig. 3A).
IL-7 receptor reexpression could permit delivery of prosurvival signals to expanded T cells administered by clinical DLI
infusions in the lymphopenic posttransplant state, where endogenous IL-7 level has been shown to be elevated up to 10
to 30 pg/mL after transplant (24). Although it is possible that
high levels of IL-7 in vivo could induce downregulation of
CD127 in the responding T cells, nevertheless, our results
suggest that the expanded T cells retain the capacity to reexpress CD127 even when rested after thaw with IL-7 at 15 to
30 pg/mL (data not shown).
CD3/CD28 costimulation with ClinExVivo Dynabeads in
this series of experiments enhanced in a larger fraction of
postexpansion T cells the capacity for intracellular expression of IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and granzyme
B (Table 1) than we previously reported using different arti-

Figure 1. A, CD3+ T-cell expansion is superior in the presence of IL-7.
Frozen/thawed cord blood T cells were enriched by negative selection,
enumerated by lyse/no wash multitest T cell staining in Trucount tubes
(BD Biosciences) as previously described (18, 50), and then split equally
into two under identical culture conditions except for the presence of
IL-7 as indicated. Cells were cultured for 12 to 14 d with ClinExVivo
Dynabeads, whereas medium and cytokines were replenished three
times a week. A 50-μL aliquot was removed from the bags at indicated
time points and absolute T cell number was enumerated in Trucount
tubes. B, irrespective of IL-7 in the culture medium, expansion leads to
dilution and near-complete loss of sjTREC in day 14 progeny. sjTRECs
were measured before and after expansion (n = 4), as published
previously (7). For each sample, total nucleated cell count and absolute T
cell content were enumerated by Trucount FACS method (10, 18).
TREC content was expressed after adjustment for 105 T cells per sample.

ficial APC beads (10). Nevertheless, despite the potential for
an increase in alloreactivity (25) after the more robust expansion in the presence of IL-7, the expanded progeny lacked
cytotoxicity against a highly immunogenic (CD40+, CD80+,
CD86 + ) EBV + allogeneic lymphoblastoid cell line (IM9;
n = 7), or recipient fibroblasts (n = 2), despite a week long
presensitization before performing the CTL assay (Fig. 5). Interestingly, absent cytotoxicity coincided with low expression
of 4-1BB/CD137, CD40L, and perforin (Table 1). Together,
these features support a favorable safety profile of day 14
ClinExVivo expanded T cells with reduced likelihood for
inducing GVHD in vivo on adoptive transfer.
Ex vivo expanded, CD3/CD28-costimulated cord blood
T cells can be primed in vitro against lymphoid and

DLI with day 14 ClinExVivo + IL-2 + IL-7–expanded T cells
generated from the originally infused cord blood graft could
alleviate posttransplant lymphopenia and qualitative T-cell
defects until thymic regeneration could contribute new T
cells. However, such DLI would be antigen nonspecific and
will require microbial and/or tumor antigens to in vivo prime
infused T cells in the transplant recipients. In a series of experiments, we evaluated the potential of day 14 CD3/CD28costimulated/expanded T cells to undergo in vitro priming
against specific leukemic targets. In vitro generated tumorspecific CTL responses could be adoptively infused to treat
leukemia patients with minimal residual disease and/or relapse. CD3/CD28-expanded day 14 T cells were stimulated
in vitro for 3 weeks in parallel cultures with killed, mitomycin
C–treated lymphoid leukemia cells (IM9) and IFN-γ–treated
myeloid leukemia cells (U937). U937 cells by themselves cannot induce allogeneic T-cell response unless a stimulating
anti-CD3 antibody is added to cultures (22). In addition, they
do not provide costimulation via the CD80/CD86-CD28 pathway but likely via the ubiquitously expressed CD147 and
CD98 molecules (22). CTL priming was performed in the decreasing presence of IL-12, IL-7, and IL-15, drawing from our
published experimental strategy to in vitro prime antiviral responses from cord blood (26). Robust T-cell expansion (195×,
±115; n = 4) ensued over the course of ∼3 weeks when killed
leukemia cells rather than ClinExVivo beads served as APC.
After the course of two to three repeated stimulations, strong
leukemia-specific cytotoxicity was detected in CTL assays,
killing the stimulating leukemia cells but not the other leukemia or, most importantly, cord blood transplant recipient
PHA blasts (n = 4; P ≤ 0.01; Fig. 6A and B). Failure to recognize and kill cord blood transplant recipient PHA blasts
indicates future clinical safety from the potential toxicity
of GVHD.

Discussion
IL-7 is a very attractive immune modulator with proposed
utility for in vivo administration to alleviate posttransplant
lymphopenia (reviewed in ref. 27). It is well accepted that
exogenous IL-7 can increase survival of naïve T cells and promotes homeostatic expansion particularly among naïve

Figure 2. Flow cytometry profile of the expanded T-cell progeny ± IL-7. Surface and intracellular (ic) FACS characterization was performed as shown
previously (10, 18, 19). The relative size of T-cell subsets in each quadrant is expressed as the percentage of total viable T cells (see Table 1 for P values).
A, CD45-PerCP/SSC defines an unambiguous region of viable cells. All other CD45 dim cells (recently apoptotic) also stain dim for CD3 (data not shown).
B, intracellular Ki67 staining (top quads) identifies more proliferating T cells when expanded with IL-7 than without. C, when expanded without IL-7,
more T cells undergo apoptosis and stain with intracellular active caspase-3+, although gated from the viable region of A. D, more T cells display the
phenotype of naïve/CD45RA+/RO− T cells when expanded with IL-7. Representative of 10 experiments.

T cells (28–31; reviewed in refs. 17, 23). Large animal models
have established that IL-7 alone will lead not only to peripheral expansion of naïve T cells but also to enrichment of antiviral CMV-specific T cells (32), showing the physiologic
relevance of IL-7Rα expression on both naïve cells and
central memory T cells. Recently, the first cohorts of humans
received recombinant human IL-7 at the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) to assess its safety and effects on T-cell

homeostasis and function (33, 34). IL-7 induced in vivo T-cell
cycling, bcl-2 upregulation, and a sustained increase in
peripheral blood and total body T-cell mass, affecting both
CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Moreover, T-cell expansion caused
significant broadening of circulating TCR repertoire diversity,
as naïve T cells expanded preferentially (34). Homeostatic
expansion is the primary mechanism of IL-7–mediated
immune restoration in these studies accompanied by dilution

of TRECs among sorted CD4+ and CD8+ naïve cells (34). Importantly, IL-7 may induce T-cell maturation in nonlymphopenic circumstances as shown by another NCI study
performed in rhesus macaques (35). In immunocompetent
macaques, IL-7 induced the acquisition of central memory
cell markers in both naïve CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell subsets.
Moreover, both central memory and effector memory T cells
entered cell cycle, showing the contribution of IL-7 to the
maintenance of the entire T-cell pool. Nevertheless, taken
together from the human and primate studies, there seems
to be a preferential expansion of RTE and naïve T cells, thus
explaining the broadened TCRVβ repertoire after IL-7
therapy and dilution of TREC in the sorted naïve cells.
Despite the consensus on the proliferative and antiapoptotic effects of IL-7, there have been conflicting reports on the

functional changes induced by IL-7. Most studies agree that
IL-7 signaling can sensitize naïve CD4+ T cells and prime T
cells for IL-2–induced IFN-γ production (36–38); however,
the variable degree of this functional maturation may have
dramatic consequences in an allogeneic milieu where exaggerated T-cell activation and alloreactivity could induce and/
or potentiate GVHD, a continuing barrier to the safety of
allogeneic transplantation (reviewed in ref. 39). It is still
vigorously debated whether donor T-cell exposure to IL-7
will worsen GVHD, as some murine studies contend (10,
25, 40, 41) or not (42, 43; reviewed in ref. 17).
The effect of IL-7 on human cord blood T cells has previously been tested in vitro (28, 44–46); however, these experiments were probing its effect without concomitant CD3/
CD28 costimulation and without concurrent exogenous

from peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy volunteers as positive
controls and compared with CD3/CD28-costimulated cord blood
T cells ± IL-7. First, effectors were primed/sensitized against a highly
immunogenic (HLA-DR+, CD40+, CD80+, CD86+) IM9 cell line for 7 to 9 d
at 1:1 to 1:3 responder/stimulator ratio and then reexposed to fresh
BATDA-loaded IM9 targets at the indicated E:T ratios for 2 and 3 h.
Europium release was measured by the Delfia EuTDA cytotoxicity assay
(10), and the calculated percent specific cytotoxicity is presented on
the Y axis. Representative of seven experiments.

IL-2. Compared with adult T cells, cord blood T cells have
been shown to express higher surface levels of IL-7Rα chain
matched with lower amounts of the common γc chain. Notably, IL-7 does not alter the surface phenotype of proliferating naïve cells (28, 47). Interestingly, whereas in adult blood
only “true” RTE (i.e., the CD31+ subset of CD62L+/CD45RA+/
CD4+ T cells) enters cell cycle in response to IL-7, in cord
blood both CD31+ and CD31− cells proliferate vigorously (48).
Our data presented above clearly show the salutary role of
IL-7 on ex vivo cord blood T-cell expansion as evidenced by
enhanced T-cell cycling, reduced apoptosis, and increased
TCRVβ diversity per family. Just as important from a clinical
immunotherapy perspective, we also show that the addition
of IL-7 to ex vivo expansion cultures using artificial CD3/
CD28 APC beads permits the limited acquisition of granzymes and secretion of Th1/Tc1 cytokines without acquisition of alloreactive cytotoxicity. Significantly, despite T-cell
maturation and an activated surface phenotype, IL-7 promotes the preservation of a surface phenotype (CD28 + /
CD27+/CD45RA+/CD62L), typically seen on naïve T cells including RTE. These surface features together with CCR-7
expression should facilitate effective T-cell homing to secondary lymphoid tissues that will be an essential step for
the infused postexpansion T cells before priming could occur
by encountering their cognate antigens in the right microenvironment. In parallel, we propose that reduced/absent cytotoxicity against allogeneic cells as a manifestation of residual
functional “immaturity” will be an essential parameter in order for clinical DLI products to safely cross the HLA barrier,
as opposed to full “adult like” cytotoxicity that may lead to
severe alloreactivity/GVHD in the HLA-mismatched, unrelated UCBT setting. The predicted safety of expanded T-cell
products in moderate doses is supported by an in vivo
NOD/SCID-β2m−/− mouse model, where adoptive transfer

tated engraftment in the absence of inducing xenogeneic
GVHD (49).
To our knowledge, our study is the first to present a relatively simple, easily reproducible methodology to ex vivo
expand cord blood T cells that meet both numerical and critical qualitative biological benchmarks to usher DLI to the
clinical UCBT setting. DLIs with ex vivo expanded T cells
from the originally infused graft could alleviate posttransplant lymphopenia and qualitative T-cell defects well before
thymic regeneration could contribute new T cells. In fact, by
starting with ∼2 × 106 total cord blood T cells, obtainable
easily by “sacrificing” 2% to 3% of a typical UCB graft,
∼100-fold expansion would yield ∼2 × 106 cells/kg for patients up to 90 kg. Dose escalation/phase I trials will be
started at lower doses in the HLA-mismatched UCBT setting
to test safety while testing for augmented cellular immune
function in a prophylactic manner for high-risk patients,
such as those with viral reactivation and severe lymphopenia.
Significantly, as we have shown with both a lymphoid and a
myeloid leukemia cell line model, the antigen nonspecific

effectors after 3 wk in CTL culture was tested against fresh, unmodified,
