ABSTRACT
We investigated the patients with solid cancers harboring Fms-like tyrosine
kinase 3 (FLT3) amplification using targeted sequencing of tumor tissue specimen
and FISH assay. Simultaneously, FLT3-amplified patient-derived cells (PDCs) were
generated to evaluate the sensitivity to FLT3 inhibition. A patient with metastatic colon
cancer who was previously treated with more than 3rd line cytotoxic chemotherapy
was found to have FLT3 amplification and then received regorafenib showing partial
response. In two PDC cell lines with FLT3 amplification, FLT3 mRNA expression was
increased, however, the growth of tumor cells was not significantly inhibited by either
regorafenib or sorafenib which is known to block the activity FLT3. Additional drug
combinations with mTOR inhibitor did not affect the cell proliferation of PDC. FLT3
amplification in solid cancers is infrequently observed using targeted genomic profile,
as yet, FLT3 amplification does not seem to be an actionable target or a proper
biomarker for FLT3 inhibitor sensitivity.

mutations, followed by gene amplification [7]. The
incidence of FLT amplification in solid tumors was reported
up to 13.8 % in breast cancer [8], 5.5% in colorectal
cancer [9], 1.7% in gastric cancer [10], and 0.4% in lung
adenocarcinoma [11]. Recently, a refractory colorectal
cancer patient with FLT3 amplification using targeted
genomic profile (FoundationOne) demonstrated clinical
benefit with sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor targeting
vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1 to
3, FLT3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR),
c-Kit protein (KIT), and RET receptor tyrosine kinases [12].
Although it remains unknown that FLT3 amplification might
be potentially actionable molecular alterations in certain
tumor types, in the current study, we investigated patients
with solid cancers majority of gastrointestinal malignancies
harboring of FLT3 amplification and the clinical efficacy of
FLT3 inhibition in this subpopulation. We further generated
patient derived cells (PDC) from some of these patients’

INTRODUCTION
Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) is a gene that
encodes for a tyrosine kinase that activates pathway
in proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic
stem cells. FLT3 is frequently mutated in acute myeloid
leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and other
hematologic malignancies [1]. Oncogenic activation of
FLT3 by internal tandem duplication was found in 20-25%
of AML patients [2, 3] and is well known for association
with poor clinical outcome [4]. In cancer cells with
activating mutations in FLT3, FLT3 inhibitors or tyrosine
kinase inhibitors have been shown to be effective [5, 6]
and a number of small-molecule tyrosine inhibitors of
FLT3 have been developed and trials are ongoing.
The role of FLT3 gene aberration in solid tumors
has not yet been established. A comprehensive analysis of
FLT3 aberrations showed that the majority are somatic

Patients’ characteristics

A 62-year-old female patient who presented with
sigmoid colon cancer with lung metastasis had recurrent
diseases in lung after curative resection followed by 8
cycles of adjuvant XELOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin)
chemotherapy. Molecular studies revealed the presence
of KRAS G12S mutation in the primary colon cancer
tissue specimen. The patient recurred with multiple lung
metastases 4 months after completion of adjuvant FOLFOX
chemotherapy. She started palliative chemotherapy with
avastin/FOLFIRI (irinotecan, leucovorin and fluorouracil)
for eight cycles but progressed. Then the patient has been
treated with regorafenib and achieved partial response
(Figure 2). Copy number of FLT3 amplification was 15-30
in FISH assay and the FLT3/CEP13 ratio was 10. In this
particular patient, patient was on regorafenib for 12.4
months with partial response.

Using targeted sequencing, an Illumina HiSeq2500based platform comprising SNV, CNV, INDEL and
chromosomal rearrangements covering 381 genes, we
identified twenty patients with FLT3 amplification. Table 1
and 2 provide baseline patient characteristics. The most
frequent cancer types were colon cancer (n=8, 40%),
followed by rectal cancer (n=7, 35%), gastric cancer
(n=3, 15%), non-small cell lung cancer (n=1, 5%), and
hepatocellular carcinoma (n=1, 5%). The median age of all
patients was 63 years (range, 40 – 83) and 60% were male.
Among gastric and colorectal cancer patients, most of the
patients (83.3%) were mild to moderate differentiated
and 6 (33.3%, colon cancer) had concomitant KRAS
mutation. In total, 9 patients (45%) were found to have

(8.3%) in the order of frequency in all FLT3-amplified
cancer (Supplementary Figure S1). We found a previously
heavily treated patient with metastatic colon cancer harboring
FLT3 amplification by targeted sequencing and the patient
showed partial response to regorafenib for 12.4 months.
Based on this, we hypothesized that FLT3 amplification
might be a potential therapeutic target in colorectal cancer
and investigated further using FLT3-amplified PDC from
colorectal cancer patients. In two PDC cell lines with FLT3
amplification, with increased FLT3 mRNA expression, tumor
growths were not significantly inhibited by either regorafenib
or sorafenib. Regorafenib and sorafenib are multikinase
inhibitors that block the activity of multiple protein kinases,
mainly tumor angiogenesis (VEGFR1-3) and also including
RET, FLT3, KIT, PDGFR, FGFR1-2, TIE2, RAF-1, BRAF,
BRAFV600E and Abl pathways.
FLT3 amplification has been previously detected
in approximately 3% of CRC samples [17, 18]. It was
reported to be associated with primary or acquired
resistance to EGFR blockade in colorectal cancers using
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) [19]. Recently, Braxton
et al. reported that FLT3 amplified cases display a high
number of pathogenic variant when compared to FLT3
wild-type cases, suggesting that FLT3 amplification in
mismatch repair proficient colorectal adenocarcinoma
occurred as a late event [20]. However, they suggested
that FLT3 amplification in CRC may not be the most
effective genomic alteration for therapy and seems to
be a passenger alteration [20]. Among 50 gastric cancer
tissues, FLT3 gene amplification (3.7-fold) was noted only
in one sample. And the MAPK pathway was activated by
mutations and gene amplifications of ERBB2, FLT3, and
KRAS [21].
So far, the FLT3 signaling cascade has not been
definitively characterized, complex associations and
downstream effects that probably occur after activation

In order to investigate the sensitivity of patient
derived tumor cells on regorafenib and sorafenib, we
generated malignant tumor cells from FLT3 amplified
tissues as described in Methods. First we measured relative
mRNA expression of FLT3 via qRT-PCR. As shown in
Figure 3A, FLT3 expression was increased in PDC#1
and PDC #2 compare to negative cell line AGS and PDC.
PDC#1 and PDC#2 were tested the anti-tumor effect
of regorafenib and sorafenib, the growth of tumor cells
was not considerably reduced by exposure of inhibitors
compared with control in vitro cell viability assay (Figure
3B). We further detected FLT3 expression and regulation
of downstream targets upon exposure to each drug via
immunoblot assay. We observed that FLT3 expression was
slightly reduced by treatment of regorafenib or sorafenib,
but downstream targets such as phospho-AKT or
phospho ERK were not affected by exposure of each drug
(Figure 4A). We next tested combination cell viability
assay with additional drug treatment to the PDC#1;
sorafenib, sunitinib, everolimus, sorafenib+everolimus,
sunitinib+everolimus, and sorafenib+sunitinib. Cell
proliferation of PDC was not significantly inhibited by
these combinations (Figure 4B).

DISCUSSION
FLT3 alterations are well documented in leukemia and
therapeutic compounds are being developed to inhibit the
activity of the constitutively active FLT3 receptors [15, 16].
In this study, the incidence of FLT3 amplification is 1.6%
(20 patients) and the majority was gastrointestinal tumors
(colorectal and gastric cancers). In the TCGA data set, the
incidence of FLT3 amplification was highest in colorectal
cancer (34.6%), breast cancer (10.5%), and gastric cancer

MATERIALS AND METHODS

of FLT3. Binding of FLT3 ligand to FLT3 triggers the
PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and RAS pathways,
leading to increased cell proliferation and the inhibition of
apoptosis [4]. Therefore, FLT3-amplification may not be
the proper biomarker for FLT3 inhibitor sensitivity, and
molecular mechanisms in addition to FLT3 amplification
may be involved in the oncogenesis of FLT3-amplified
solid cancers. Even in patients with FLT3-mutated
leukemia, a number of small molecule tyrosine kinase
inhibitors with activity against FLT3 have been developed
[22, 23] but, as of yet, none of the studied FLT3 inhibitors
has not been used for routine clinical use in FLT3-mutated
AML. This is in part due to the insufficient antitumor
effect observed with most FLT3 inhibitors alone and rapid
development of resistance which may illustrate the need
for additional therapeutics [24].
In summary, FLT3 amplification in solid cancers is
a frequently encountered genomic alteration in the clinic
with various prevalence across cancer types. However,
based on our data, FLT3 may not be an “actionable”
target, at least in colorectal cancer, either as monotherapy
or combined therapy. We are currently investigating
other genomic alterations that may be associated with
regorafenib in the patient case presented in this paper.

Patients
This investigation was conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and
national and international guidelines, and was approved
by the Institutional Review Board at Samsung Medical
Center. Between October 2013 and Jan 2016, 1,250
patients with gastrointestinal cancer, rare cancer, and
lung cancer were prospectively enrolled in the screening
program at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea using
targeted sequencing. Patient inclusion criteria were as
follows; age ≥18 years, pathologically confirmed cancer,
resection/ biopsies of the primary or metastatic site, and
available data on clinicopathologic characteristics.

Targeted exome sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted, and a SureSelect
customized kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
USA) was used for capturing 83 or 379 cancer-related genes
depending on the version of sequencing panel. Illumina
HiSeq 2500 was used for sequencing with 100 bp paired3242

end reads. The sequencing reads were aligned to the human
genome reference sequence (hg19) using BWA-mem
(v0.7.5), SAMTOOLS (v0.1.18), Picard (v1.93), and GATK
(v3.1.1) for sorting SAM/BAM files, duplicate marking,
and local realignment, respectively. Local realignment and
base recalibration were carried out based on dbSNP137,
Mills indels, HapMap, and Omni. SNVs and InDels were
identified using Mutect (v1.1.4) and Pindel (v0.2.4),
respectively. ANNOVAR was used to annotate the detected
variants. Only variants with over 1% of allele frequency
were included in the results. Copy number variations were
calculated for targeted sequencing regions by dividing readdepth per exon by the normal reads per exon using an inhouse reference. Translocations in the target region were
identified using an in-house algorithm (in preparation).

according to the manufacturers’ recommendations.
Total RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed
with the SuperScript®III First-Strand Synthesis
System using Oligo(dT) 20 primer (Invitrogen Corp,
Carlsbad, California, USA). All qPCR reactions were
performed with a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), using FLT3
primer Forward:5’-CCATCTTGGACCTGGAAGAA-3’
Reverse:5’-AAGATGTGCCAAGGGAATTG-3’, and
GAPDH (Forward:5’-ACA ACT TTG GTA TCG TGG
G-3’ Reverse:5’- GCC ATC ACG CCA CAG TTT
C-3’) was used as the housekeeping gene for relative
quantification. All genes were run in triplicate to allow for
the assessment of technical variability.

Cell treatment and viability assay

FLT amplification by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) assay

After pathologic confirmation, cells were seeded on
1~2 × 106 cells/10 mm dishes or 5000 cells/ well/ 96well
plate for analysis of immunoblotting and cell proliferation
inhibition assay and treated for 3~5 days with various
doses of drugs, as indicated. Cell proliferation inhibition
was determined via Cell Titer Glo (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Tumor sections were cut to 1 μm thickness, followed
by deparaffinization with the pretreatment reagent (Abbott,
30-801250) at 80°C for 30 min. Protease digestion procedures
were performed using the protease reagent (Abbott,
30-801255) at 37°C for 20 min. FLT3 probes (Empire
genomics, FLT3-20-RE) and Chr 13 control probe (Empire
genomics, CHR13-10-GR) were hybridized at 73°C for 5
min and 37°C for 20 h. After hybridization, the slides were
washed in 2× saline-sodium citrate/0.3% NP-40 at 72°C for
5 min, air dried, and counterstained with 4′, 6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) I and DAPI II (Abbott Molecular).
The slides were examined under a fluorescence microscope
equipped with Spectrum Texas Red with isothiocyanate and
DAPI filters. The FLT3/Chr13 ratio was established after
counting at least 50 tumor cell nuclei. An FLT3/Chr13 ratio
higher than 2.0 was interpreted as gene amplification-positive.

Immunoblot analysis
Total proteins from PDCs were isolated using RIPA
buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing a
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany)
and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and protein
concentrations were determined according to Bradford
procedure using a Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Thirty μg of proteins
were subjected to 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, and electro-transferred onto nitocellulose
membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5 %
nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1%
v/v Tween 20, and probed overnight at 4°C with a Specific
antibodies: phospho-FLT3(Tyr591) and FLT3(8F2),
pAkt (Ser473), Akt(C67E7), pERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204),
ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA, USA), and beta actin from Sigma Aldrich.
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or
mouse IgG (Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) were used
as a secondary antibody, and signals were detected by
chemiluminescence using ECL Western Blotting Substrate
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), and visualized by
using LAS-4000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).

Patient-derived cell culture
Tumor tissue from patients with metastatic cancer
was removed surgically or biopsy from patients who had
provided informed consent. Collected tissue was minced and
dissociated with enzymatic method. The cells were grown
in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Gibco BRL, Paisley, UK) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Gibco BRL), 0.5 μg/ ml of hydrocortisone
(Sigma Aldrich), 5 μg/ ml of insulin (PeproTech, Rocky Hill,
NJ, USA), 5 ng of EGF and 2.5 ng of FGF (PeproTech).
The medium was changed every 3 days, and cells were
maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. PDCs
were passaged using TrypLE Express (Gibco BRL) to detach
cells when the cells reached 80–90% confluence.

Statistical method
For PDC viability curves, results are expressed
as the means. Paired one way ANOVA tests were used
to calculate the P values. Statistical significance was
assessed using one way ANOVA tests and described in
the figure.

Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction
