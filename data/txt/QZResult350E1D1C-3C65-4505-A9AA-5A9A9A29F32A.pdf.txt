Abstract
Cancer-selective drug delivery is an important concept in improving treatment
while minimizing off-site toxicities, and sigma-2 receptors, which are overexpressed
in solid tumors, represent attractive pharmacologic targets. Select sigma-2 ligands
have been shown to be rapidly internalized selectively into cancer cells while retaining
the capacity to deliver small molecules as drug cargoes. We utilized the sigma-2based drug delivery concept to convert Erastin, a clinically underperforming drug,
into a potent pancreatic cancer therapeutic. The Erastin derivative des-methyl Erastin
(dm-Erastin) was chemically linked to sigma-2 ligand SV119 to create SW V-49.
Conjugation increased the killing capacity of dm-Erastin by nearly 35-fold in vitro and
reduced the size of established tumors and doubled the median survival in syngeneic
and patient-derived xenograft models when compared to non-targeted dm-Erastin.
Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that cell death was associated with robust reactive
oxygen species production and could be efficiently antagonized with antioxidants.
Mass spectrometry was employed to demonstrate selective uptake into pancreatic
cancer cells. Thus, targeted delivery of dm-Erastin via conjugation to the sigma-2
ligand SV119 produced efficient tumor control and prolonged animal survival with
minimal off-target toxicities, and SW V-49 represents a promising new therapeutic
with the potential to advance the fight against pancreatic cancer.

remains the only potential cure, but only 15 to 20 percent
of patients are diagnosed early enough to be amenable for
an attempt at resection [2]. Even in this highly select group
of patients, the prognosis remains poor due to a high rate

of local recurrence and metastatic disease [3]. Treatment
with standard chemotherapy offers a very modest
prolongation of life with few, if any, cures [3]. There is
desperate need to explore novel therapeutics to improve
outcomes. The clinical need is so marked that Congress
recently passed the Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act
specifically to encourage further research into treatments
for pancreatic cancer.
Erastin is a small molecule discovered during a
screen of synthetic compounds with cytotoxic activity
in cells containing mutations in the KRAS oncogene [4].
KRAS mutations are found in more than 90% of pancreatic
cancers, and despite its frequency and being the earliest
genetic alteration, previous attempts to selectively target
KRAS have failed [5, 6]. Erastin has been shown to inhibit
the cystine/glutamate antiporter (system xc-), resulting in
the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
non-apoptotic cancer cell death [7, 8]. System xc- permits
uptake of cystine, which is vital to the formation of
cysteine, a key building block for the production of the
antioxidant glutathione, an important contributor to cell
homeostasis [9]. Additionally, Erastin has been reported
to target mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels
[10]. These channels are found in the outer mitochondrial
membrane and facilitate transport of metabolites [11]
and were reported to be important, but not sufficient, to
result in Erastin-mediated cell death [10]. Erastin and its
analogues have been explored in several clinical trials
but have underperformed [12, 13]. We hypothesized that
the lack of in vivo efficacy was caused by either a lack
of targeted drug delivery and/or a failure of an efficient
uptake mechanism by the cancer cells.
Targeting cytotoxic cancer therapeutics selectively
to cancer cells represents a highly desired objective with
potential to improve treatment efficacies and minimize
off-target toxicities. Over the last decade, our laboratory
has developed efficient means to selectively deliver
small molecule drug cargoes into cancer cells based
on the sigma-2 ligand/receptor concept [14]. We have
demonstrated sigma-2 receptors to be overexpressed in
most human malignancies, including pancreatic cancer
[15]. Sigma-2 ligands have been shown to be rapidly
internalized into cancer cells [16] and, at high doses, are
capable of inducing apoptosis [15, 17-19]. Importantly,
sigma-2 ligand conjugates retain the capacity to bind
and deliver additional drug cargoes into cancer cells.
The sigma-2 ligand portion provides targeting while
the effector molecule provides functionality as part of
the dual-domain therapeutic [14, 20, 21]. In summary,
we have previously established proof-of-principal for
sigma-2 ligand targeted cancer delivery with several small
molecules, and this work represents the culmination of a
highly collaborative multi-investigator effort focused on
developing a new therapeutic with the goal of testing the
sigma-2 cancer delivery concept clinically.
Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the novel small molecule drug conjugate SW V-49. This
dual-domain compound was synthesized as a conjugate
of the sigma-2 ligand SV119 with des-methyl Erastin
(dm-Erastin). In these studies, we show that SW V-49
overcomes the cellular internalization block of dm-Erastin
and reduces tumor sizes while improving survival in the
best available models of pancreatic cancer. Our results
suggest that SW V-49 is a highly potent pancreatic cancer
therapeutic worthy of clinical investigation.

Results
Synthesis of the sigma-2/dm-Erastin conjugate
SW V-49
The main focus of our work was to develop novel
therapies for evaluation in patients with pancreatic
cancer. Erastin (Figure 1A) and its analogues are small
molecules with cancer-selective cytotoxic activity profiles
in vitro and thus represent attractive candidates for drug
development [4]. The initial reports on Erastin analogues
suggested that they might prove effective in pancreatic
cancer patients, but they underperformed in clinical trials
[12, 13]. We sought to understand why this drug class
failed clinically and found that Erastin alone was incapable
of inducing cell death in AsPC-1 and other pancreatic
cancer cells in vitro while SYO-1 synovial cancer cells
were sensitive (Figure 1B). We hypothesized that the
lack of efficacy in pancreatic cancer might be caused
by a deficiency in cellular drug uptake/internalization.
Based on our previous experience utilizing sigma-2
ligands to deliver a payload to cancer cells [14, 20-22],
we theorized that uptake blockade could potentially
be overcome if we chemically conjugated Erastin to
a sigma-2 ligand. We theorized that the conjugation
would not sterically interfere with Erastin’s function
and cancer-selective lethality. An important criteria in
choosing small molecules for further development into
dual-domain drug conjugates is accessibility to chemical
synthesis. The originally described Erastin molecule was
challenging to synthesize due to an optically active carbon
atom located within its structure (Figure 1A, asterisk). A
slightly modified analogue, dm-Erastin, was reported to
be functionally equivalent to the parental molecule as the
methyl-substituted carbon is not necessary for its activity,
thus avoiding the additional optically active structural site
[23]. Thus, prior to generating the sigma-2/Erastin drug
conjugate, we synthesized dm-Erastin (Figure 1A) and
compared it with commercially available Erastin (EMD
Millipore) in cell viability assays. Both drugs had identical
cytotoxic activity profiles when assessed on Erastinsensitive synovial sarcoma cells (data not shown). As a
result of these comparisons, dm-Erastin was chemically
linked to our sigma-2 delivery vehicle SV119 (Figure S1)

human- and murine-derived pancreatic cancer cell lines
(Figure 2B).
Historically, clinical efficacy has not reliably
followed success of novel therapies in long cultured
cancer cell lines, and investigators have postulated that
genetic drift and adaptation to cell culture conditions
have contributed to a lack of translatability [24]. Patientderived three dimensional cultures (organoids) are thought
to better predict clinical successes [25, 26]. To assess the
efficacy of SW V-49 in patient-derived organoid cultures,
we treated multiple human pancreatic cancer organoid
cultures (n = 5) with varying doses of SW V-49, SV119,
and dm-Erastin (Figure 2C). As with the established cell
lines, we observed a robust response following treatment
with SW V-49, which resulted in an IC50 of 1.84 µM
(SEM: ± 1.10). The controls behaved slightly different
in organoids. The SV119 delivery molecule was nearly
inactive and dm-Erastin exhibited a small cytotoxic
response at the highest doses.
To test whether cellular uptake is improved via
chemical conjugation with SV119, we utilized mass
spectrometry and asked if pancreatic cancer cells were
able to absorb SW V-49 from the culture supernatant when
compared with non-conjugated dm-Erastin. Based on prior
studies demonstrating rapid uptake of sigma-2 ligands into
cancer cells [16], we treated human pancreatic cancer cells
(MIA PaCa-2) with SW V-49 or dm-Erastin for two hours.

SW V-49 overcomes the chemotherapeutic plateau
of dm-Erastin via enhanced drug uptake
As previously noted, all of our pancreatic cancer cell
lines were resistant to Erastin. To test if conjugation to a
sigma-2 ligand would overcome this treatment resistance,
PANC-1 cells were treated with SW V-49, SV119
alone, dm-Erastin alone, and with equimolar mixtures
of SV119 and dm-Erastin combined. Concentrations
of dm-Erastin as high as 100 µM failed to demonstrate
significant cytotoxic effects and its half-maximal killing
concentration (IC50) was greater than 150 µM (Figure
2A). The moderate killing profile of the delivery agent
SV119 was anticipated as reported previously [14, 17, 18].
Furthermore, equimolar mixes of dm-Erastin with SV119
did not lead to a substantial improvement over the baseline
activity of SV119, as cytotoxicity was nearly identical
to that of sigma-2 ligand alone (Figure 2A). In stark
contrast to all other treatment groups, SW V-49 elicited a
robust cytotoxic response with an IC50 in the single digit
micromolar range. SW V-49 was 17-fold more effective
than an equimolar mix of SV119 and dm-Erastin (Figure
2A, IC50: 4.1 µM ± 0.2 vs 70.0 µM ± 0.3, p < 0.05). This
in vitro activity profile was confirmed across a panel of

Figure 1: Chemical structures demonstrating the parental compounds and the novel drug conjugate SW V-49. A. The
parental Erastin molecule (asterisk) and its des-methyl variant are nearly identical structurally. The sigma-2 ligand SV119 was chemically
conjugated to dm-Erastin, resulting in the sigma-2/dm-Erastin conjugate SW V-49. B. SYO-1 synovial sarcoma cells were treated in a cell
viability assay to demonstrate that Erastin is functionally active. In contrast, AsPC-1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells did not respond to
Erastin, as demonstrated by lack of cellular death.

SW V-49 reduces tumor growth and improves
survival in syngeneic and patient-derived
xenograft models of pancreatic cancer

The supernatants and cell pellets were then harvested
and submitted for mass spectrometry. Drug-containing
medium in the absence of cells was used to establish the
baseline signal intensity for the respective compound.
We found that dm-Erastin did not show any evidence
for entering the cancer cells, also reflected by the fact
that the drug concentration in the supernatant remained
unaltered during the course of the experiment (Figure 2D).
Extended exposure times and increased drug doses did not
lead to accumulation of dm-Erastin in the cell pellets. In
contrast, SW V-49 was found to be associated with the
cell pellet, while the drug concentration in the supernatant
fell concomitantly (Figure 2D). These data strongly
support the hypothesis that the sigma-2 ligand delivery
moiety of SW V-49 (SV119) is necessary and sufficient to
facilitate efficient transport across the plasma membrane
of pancreatic cancer cells, otherwise impermeable for the
unconjugated drug cargo (dm-Erastin).

To determine the in vivo efficacy of SW V-49, we
employed several murine model systems of pancreatic
cancer. We utilized genetically-engineered murine models
driven by a KRAS mutation on a C57BL/6 background
[27, 28] as well as a patient-derived xenograft model using
athymic nude mice [29]. In the subcutaneous syngeneic
model, C57BL/6 mice (n = 15 per group) were observed
until tumors measured 5-6 mm in diameter and then treated
with daily i.p. injections of 375 nanomoles of SW V-49,
SV119, Erastin, an equimolar mix of SV119 and Erastin,
or vehicle. SW V-49 more than doubled the median
survival to 48 days (SD: ± 16.9); while vehicle (20.0 ± 8.4
days), Erastin (18.0 ± 9.2 days), SV119 (19.0 ± 8.6 days),
and the equimolar mix of SV119 and Erastin (21.0 ± 7.9
days) all had significantly shorter survivals (Figure 3A,
p < 0.0001). Only SW V-49 was capable of reducing the
mean tumor volume during the treatment interval (Figure
3B, p = 0.0003). None of the other compounds, alone or
in combination, resulted in a reduction of tumor size and
all control groups exhibited similar growth rates when

Figure 2: Conjugation to SV119 overcomes the internalization block of dm-Erastin and increases efficacy in pancreatic
cancer cell lines. A. PANC-1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of SW V-49, SV119, Erastin, and an equimolar mix of

SV119 and Erastin. CellTiter-Glo cell viability assay was performed 24 hours post-treatment. The half-maximal killing activities (IC50)
of the various treatment conditions are expressed as means (n ≥ 3/group). B. The drug activity profiles (IC50 ± SEM) of SW V-49, Erastin,
SV119, and the equimolar mix of SV119 and Erastin are shown across multiple pancreatic cancer cell lines (BxPC-3, AsPC-1, MIA PaCa2, KCKO). SW V-49 treatment was effective and potent across all cell lines. C. Pancreatic cancer organoids (hM1 [41] is shown) were
treated with increasing concentrations of SW V-49, SV119, and dm-Erastin. Cell viability was measured 72 hours after treatment using
CellTiter-Glo. Only treatment with SW V-49 resulted in a robust cytotoxic response (IC50: 1.84 µM ± 1.10). Minimal effect of dm-Erastin
and SV119 was observed. D. MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were exposed to SW V-49 and dm-Erastin for 2 hours. Only
SW V-49 was decreased from the media supernatant and present in the cell pellet, whereas dm-Erastin remained in the supernatant without
any significant detection in the cell pellet.

Importantly, there were no treatment-related deaths
or gross abnormalities in mouse behavior. In order to
assess for more subtle toxicities, serum chemistries (AST,
ALT, BUN, total protein, glucose, and Cr) and complete
blood counts were analyzed and there were no significant
differences (Tables S1 and S2). Necropsy, performed by a
blinded veterinary pathologist employed by our Digestive
Diseases Core facility, revealed no difference in mass
(vehicle: 20.7± 0.6 grams; SW V-49: 21.3 ± 2.1 grams; p
= 0.600) nor any injury to brain, heart, lungs, alimentary
tract, kidneys, liver, or pancreas. Only mild peritonitis was
identified at the site of repeated drug injections.
SW V-49 was evaluated in patient-derived xenograft
models of pancreatic cancer, which our group and others
believe complement the purely murine models [30-32].
Thirty mice bearing subcutaneous patient-derived tumors
were randomized to receive daily treatment with i.p.

injections of 375 nanomoles of SW V-49 or vehicle control
for 2 weeks. SW V-49 nearly doubled median survival
from 33 days (SD: ± 11.5) in the control group to 58 days
(SD: ± 12.5) in the conjugate-treated group (Figure 3C,
p = 0.0002). Additionally, SW V-49 markedly slowed
the growth rate of the established tumors (Figure 3D, p
< 0.0001). All mice tolerated the treatment well without
obvious off-target effects.
We compared SW V-49 to a standard treatment
for pancreatic cancer (gemcitabine) to understand the
comparative magnitude of our drug’s effect. In addition,
we evaluated the effectiveness in yet another tumor model.
The KP-2 tumor line, recently derived from a geneticallyengineered spontaneously-arising model, was implanted
orthotopically into C57BL/6 mice (n = 5-6 mice/group)
to assess the efficacy of SW V-49 in a stroma-dense
model (Figure S2). Similar genetic crosses have been
demonstrated to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment

C57BL/6 mice (n = 10 mice/group) with established KCKO tumors were treated daily i.p. with 375 nanomoles of the indicated compounds

16.9). All other groups had a significantly lower median survival (***p < 0.001). Mice treated with vehicle, Erastin only, SV 119 only,
and an equimolar mix of SV119 and Erastin had median survivals of 20.0 ± 8.4 days, 18.0 ± 9.2 days, 19.0 ± 8.6 days, and 21.0 ± 7.9
days, respectively. B. There was no significant difference between DMSO, SV119, dm-Erastin, and the equimolar mix of SV119 and dmErastin (p = 0.9). Tumor volumes in mice treated with SW V-49 were significantly smaller compared in all control groups (***p < 0.001).
C. Athymic nude mice (n = 15 mice/group) with established patient-derived xenograft tumors (PDX) were treated daily i.p. with 375
nanomoles of SW V-49 for 14 days. Mice treated with vehicle served as a control. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve of the mice is shown.

SW V-49 competes for the sigma-2 receptor with
known sigma-2 binders and activates cargospecific signaling pathways

from the stromal and immunologic perspectives to better
model the human disease [33, 34].
Mice were randomized to receive i.p. injections
twice weekly of 20 mg/kg gemcitabine or injections daily
of 200 nanomoles SW V-49 for two weeks. Vehicle was
utilized as a control. The dosing of SW V-49 was decreased
to assess for potency with a smaller amount. Mice treated
with SW V-49 had significantly smaller tumors compared
to gemcitabine (p = 0.0007) and vehicle (p = 0.0003),
indicating SW V-49 was effective in a stroma-dense model
even at lower doses (Figure 4A). These data were repeated
utilizing a genetically-engineered spontaneously-arising
tumor line (KCKO) derived by another group [27, 28] via
implanting tumors subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice.
When tumors reached 5-6 mm in diameter, mice were
treated twice weekly with i.p. injections of 200 nanomoles
SW V-49, 20 mg/kg gemcitabine, or vehicle alone. Mice
treated with SW V-49 had significantly smaller tumors
compared to both gemcitabine (p = 0.049) and vehicle
groups (Figure 4B, p = 0.047).
In summary, SW V-49 effectively treated tumors in
subcutaneous and orthotopic locations and results were
reproducible in both patient-derived and geneticallyengineered murine models. SW V-49 demonstrated
efficacy without measurable toxicity and outperformed
gemcitabine, a clinical standard for the treatment of
pancreatic cancer.

SW V-49 is a new chemical entity, and it is highly
unlikely that our conjugate should enter a cancer cell
without utilizing the sigma-2 ligand/receptor complex. It
would also be unexpected that SW V-49 should develop
an entirely new mechanism of action. For completeness,
we sought to confirm that SW V-49 binds to the sigma-2
receptor and retains Erastin’s main mechanism of action.
In order to demonstrate that SW V-49 binds to the sigma-2
receptor, we performed a competition assay with SW120,
a fluorescently-labeled sigma-2 ligand [35], as previously
described [21]. SW V-49 was able to block uptake of
SW120 in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 5A).
We further sought to verify that the mechanism
of Erastin was preserved after conjugation to SV119.
Erastin has been shown to initiate ROS-dependent cell
death via blockade of the cystine/glutamate antiporter
(system xc-) [7]. To elucidate the impact of our conjugate
on the uptake of cystine, AsPC-1 cells were treated
for three minutes with SV119, Erastin, an equimolar
combination of SV119 and Erastin, and SW V-49. Cellular
cystine uptake was monitored via scintillography using
radiolabeled cystine. SV119 exhibited minimal impact on
the uptake profile of radiolabeled cystine. Erastin alone
had the anticipated effect, and the addition of SV119 did
not enhance the blocking effect (Figure 5B). However,
chemical conjugation of the two components, SW V-49,
resulted in a marked decrease in cystine internalization by
the cancer cells. There was an 85% (SD: ± 2.7) blockade

Figure 4: SW V-49 outperforms gemcitabine in stroma-dense models of pancreatic cancer. A. C57BL/6 mice (n = 5-6 mice/
group) with KP-2 orthotopic tumors were treated twice weekly with 20 mg/kg gemcitabine i.p. or with daily 200 nanomoles SW V-49 for
two weeks once a palpable tumor had formed. Mice in the SW V-49 group had significantly smaller tumors compared to gemcitabine (***p
= 0.0007) and vehicle (***p = 0.0003). B. C57BL/6 mice (n = 5 mice/group) with established KCKO tumors were treated twice weekly
with 20 mg/kg gemcitabine i.p. or twice weekly with 200 nanomoles/injection SW V-49 i.p. for three weeks after tumors had grown to 5-6
mm in diameter. Mice in the SW V-49 group had significantly smaller tumors compared to gemcitabine (p = 0.049) and vehicle (p = 0.047).

with the conjugate compared to untreated cells. Compared
to the mix of SV119 and Erastin (43 ± 2.5% blockade),
we observed a 4-fold uptake reduction with the conjugate
(Figure 5B, p = 0.004). We then assessed for ROS
production to further confirm that the expected effector
pathway of dm-Erastin was still functional with our

conjugate. The strong effect of SW V-49 on the cystine/
glutamate antiporter correlated with ROS production. After
AsPC-1 cells were treated, the production of intracellular
ROS increased significantly only for SW V-49 (Figure
5C, p < 0.0001). All other compounds, in isolation and as
equimolar mixtures, did not result in elevated ROS levels

V-49 inhibits uptake of a fluorescently labeled sigma-2 ligand (SW120) in a dose-dependent manner. AsPC-1 cells were pretreated with
increasing concentrations of SW V-49, followed by incubation with SW120 (10 nM), prior to analysis by flow cytometry. B. A cystine
uptake assay was performed to assess the impact of the various compounds on the system xc- antiporter. AsPC-1 cells were exposed for
three minutes with SW V-49, SV119, Erastin, or an equimolar mix of SV119 and Erastin (200 µM). Uptake of 14C-labeled cystine was
recorded by scintillography relative to DMSO treated control cells. Cystine uptake was reduced nearly 4-fold by 85% (SD: ± 2.7) in cells
treated with SW V-49 compared to cells with an equimolar concentration of SV119 and Erastin (**p = 0.004). C. The production of ROS
was measured as an indicator of effective Erastin-driven cytotoxic activity. AsPC-1 cells were treated with 8 µM of compound and ROS
production was assayed one hour after treatment. Only SW V-49 treatment caused a ROS production level 1.5-fold (SD: ± 0.04 fold) higher
than in all other treatment groups (****p < 0.0001). D. Addition of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevents SW V-49-mediated
cell death (**p = 0.003). AsPC-1 cells were treated with NAC (10 mM) or vehicle and then exposed to SW V-49 (10 µM); NAC treatment
rescued AsPC-1 cells from SW V-49.

and were similar to DMSO-treated control cells (Figure
5C). Cell death was completely abolished in the presence
of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) (Figure 5D, p
= 0.003), further suggesting the ROS pathway is a major
contributor of cancer cell death induced by SW V-49.

conjugate. SW V-49 also proved to be highly effective in
three-dimensional pancreatic cancer organoid cultures.
Success in this experimental in vitro setting may better
predict drug efficacy at clinically achievable drug
concentrations due to the ability of the organoid cultures
to reproduce relevant aspects of disease progression
unachievable in standard in vitro cell culture experiments.
The most promising finding of our current study
was the ability of SW V-49 to effectively target pancreatic
cancer in multiple murine models with minimal toxicity.
We demonstrated the strong therapeutic response in
several immunocompetent syngeneic models, a patientderived xenograft model, and stroma-dense orthotopic
models. Each of these models has features which
recapitulate an aspect of the human disease and, taken
together, we interpret success in all these models as a
suggestion that SW V-49 has potential as a therapeutic for
human pancreatic cancer. Only a short treatment interval
with SW V-49 was required to reduce tumor sizes, delay
tumor growth, and improve survival of our test animals.
In addition, we found SW V-49 to be more effective in
decreasing tumor burden than gemcitabine, a standard
chemotherapeutic used clinically for pancreatic cancer.
The cancer-selective delivery of SW V-49 may limit offsite toxicity and this supposition is supported by normal
complete blood counts and serum chemistries in treated
mice as well as by pathologic examination at necropsy.
Finally, we demonstrated preserved function of the
Erastin analogue in inhibiting the system xc- antiporter
[7]. Pancreatic cancer cells have been reported to
upregulate expression of system xc-[39], which leads
to an enhanced capacity to import cystine, resulting in
increased glutathione production. Here, we overcame
the internalization block in pancreatic cancer and
demonstrated a nearly 4-fold higher efficiency of SW
V-49 than Erastin in inhibiting cystine uptake. This
inhibition directly correlated with a robust increase in
ROS production as quickly as one hour post-treatment
and could be rescued by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine.
In summary, pancreatic cancer is a devastating
malignancy and novel treatment approaches are
desperately needed. Targeted delivery and efficient
internalization of small molecules to pancreatic cancer
cells represents one of the key advantages of the sigma-2
ligand-based drug concept. Tumor-selective delivery of the
novel Erastin conjugate SW V-49 decreased tumor burden
and increased survival while limiting off-site toxicities
in preclinical mouse models of pancreatic cancer. Given
the impressive findings using the best available models of
pancreatic cancer explored in our current study, we believe
further experimentation is highly warranted to rapidly
advance this conjugate towards clinical evaluation.

Discussion
Sigma-2 ligands have been shown to preferentially
bind cancer cells [36], and we have previously described
their capacity not only to image pancreatic cancers
in animal models [15] but, even more importantly, in
clinical imaging studies [37]. We and others have tested
the safety of sigma-2 ligands and discovered that several
of these compounds had intrinsic anti-cancer properties
at high doses [17-19]. However, our observation that
sigma-2 ligands were capable of internalizing additional
drug cargoes provided the impetus for the development
of more effective cancer-selective therapeutics [14,
20]. Previously, we tested delivery of peptides and
chemotherapeutic agents and found that some small
molecules retain their mechanism of action and efficacy
when conjugated to select sigma-2 ligands. In several
instances, conjugation to a sigma-2 ligand also enhanced
delivery and internalization of the drug cargo [20, 21].
Erastin exhibits features that make it an attractive
cargo for sigma-2 ligand-mediated cancer cell delivery.
Erastin was initially described as a potent cytotoxic drug
against RAS mutant cancers [10], and as KRAS mutations
are found in more than 90% of pancreatic cancer patients
[38], we hypothesized that an Erastin-based therapy
would work effectively if we could overcome the uptake
blockade observed in pancreatic cancer cells. We found
our conjugate to be effective in KRAS-mutant and KRASwildtype pancreatic cancer cells. Subsequently, others
have also found that the main mechanism of action for
Erastin and its analogues is a non-apoptotic, oxidative
form of cell death [7, 8]. We believe that our conjugate
is so effective at generating ROS in cancer cells that it is
impossible for us to differentiate subtle differences that
might exist between KRAS-mutant and KRAS-wildtype
cancers.
Through chemical conjugation, we successfully
converted an Erastin analogue into a potent, targeted
therapeutic (SW V-49) for pancreatic cancer with minimal
off-site toxicity. Conjugation of dm-Erastin with SV119
overcame the internalization block that was observed
in pancreatic cancer while preserving Erastin’s inherent
anti-tumor activity. We successfully demonstrated
cellular association and reduction from the extracellular
environment (supernatant) of SW V-49, while dm-Erastin
remained in the media, despite the presence of pancreatic
cancer cells in the culture vessels. We demonstrated
that SW V-49 competed for the sigma-2 receptor with
another well-established sigma-2 ligand suggesting the
delivery and internalization function was preserved in the

were assayed in triplicates.

Human pancreatic tumor organoid culture

Small molecules

Organoids were isolated and grown as previously
described [41] and dissociated into single cells using
TrypIE (Life Technologies). For each well of a 384-well
plate, 500 cells were plated in 50 µL mixture of human
complete organoid media [41] supplemented with 10%
GFR-Matrigel (Corning) and 10 µM Rho Kinase inhibitor
Y-27632 (Sigma). Twenty-four hours after plating, 50 µL
human complete organoid media containing SW V-49,
SV119, or dm-Erastin was dispensed. Cell viability
was measured 72 hours post-treatment using CellTiterGlo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. Experiment was
replicated with cells from 5 different patients.

The originally identified Erastin molecule [10] was
purchased from EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA). Sigma-2
ligand SV119 and Erastin analogue (dm-Erastin) were
synthesized according to published methods [23, 40].
Synthesis of the sigma-2/dm-Erastin conjugate (SW V-49)
is described in detail (Figure S1).

Cell lines
The pancreatic cancer lines AsPC-1, BxPC-3, Mia
PaCa-2, and PANC-1 were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The
synovial sarcoma cell line SYO-1 was provided by
Dr. Van Tine. The mouse KCKO cell line isolated
from a spontaneously developing pancreatic cancer
overexpressing human MUC1 [27, 28] was kindly
provided by Dr. Pinku Mukherjee (University of North
Carolina, Charlotte, NC). The mouse KP-2 line was
derived from pancreatic cancer tumor tissue obtained
from p48-CRE/LSL-KrasG12D/p53flox/+ mice (backcrossed
C57BL/6, n = 6). AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells were cultured
in RPMI-1940 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS). MIA PaCa-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS and
2.5% horse serum. PANC-1 and SYO-1 cells were cultured
in DMEM with 10% FBS. KCKO cells were cultured in
RPMI-1940 medium with 10% FBS, 1% sodium pyruvate,
1% HEPES buffer, and 1% L-glutamine. KP-2 cells
were cultured in 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham’s F-12
Nutrient Mixture with 10% FBS. Penicillin (100 mg/mL)
and streptomycin (100 mg/mL) were added to all media;
cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 ºC
with 5% CO2. Cells were authenticated (every 6 months,
last in October 2015) by morphology, doubling times,
short tandem repeat profiling and tested for mycoplasma.

Mass spectrometry detection of SW V-49 and dmErastin in vitro
MIA PaCa-2 cells were plated at a density of 5 x
105 cells/well in clear-bottom 6-well plates for 24 hours
prior to treatment. The cells were exposed to 8 µM SW
V-49 or dm-Erastin. After 2 hours, the supernatant was
aspirated. The remaining cells were washed twice with
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and harvested with
trypsin/EDTA buffer (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY). Empty wells were used to test drug stability in media
at 37 ºC. Samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry
at the Proteomics & Mass Spectrometry Facility at the
Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. Cell samples
were extracted using 1 mL 1:1 acetonitrile/methanol then
dried down and resuspended to 100 µL. Media samples
were diluted 30x prior to injection. Compounds were
analyzed using a 4000 QTRAP equipped with a Shimadzu
Prominence UPLC with an injection volume of 20 µL
using standard gradient and solvents. Experimentation was
performed in triplicates.

In vivo assessment of SW V-49 in syngeneic and
patient-derived xenograft models of pancreatic
cancer

Efficacy studies of the targeted drug conjugate
SW V-49 in vitro

Animal studies were performed in adherence with
the animal studies protocol approved by the Washington
University Institutional Animal Care Facility. C57BL/6
mice (6 weeks old, National Cancer Institute Laboratories)
were injected in the right flank with 200 µL of a single-cell
suspension of KCKO cells in RPMI medium (2.5 x 105
cells per mouse). Treatment began when the mean tumor
diameter was 5-6 mm. Mice received daily i.p. injections
with 375 nanomoles SW V-49, SV119, dm-Erastin, or
equimolar combination of SV119 and dm-Erastin in 100
µL vehicle or vehicle alone (control) for 10 days. Vehicle

Cancer cell lines (pancreatic or sarcoma) were
plated at a density of 2 x 104 cells/well in black clearbottom 96-well plates for 24 hours prior to treatment. The
cells were treated for 24 hours with their respective drugs
(alone, in combination, or as a conjugate). Untreated cells
served as a control. Cytotoxicity was evaluated employing
a CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
(Promega, Madison, WI) [20]. Luminescence signals were
recorded using a multi-mode microplate reader (BioTek
instruments, Winooski, VT). Different drug concentrations

was a mixture of 25% Cremophor in H2O. Tumors were
measured in two dimensions every other day with a digital
caliper, and tumor volumes were calculated by the standard
formula of Tumor Volume = Length x Width2 x 0.5.
Several mice from each treatment cohort were assessed
for pathologic evaluation (Digestive Diseases Research
Core Center at our institution). Blood was collected for
complete blood count (CBC) and biochemical analysis
(AST, ALT, BUN, total protein, glucose and Cr). Organs
were examined grossly and histologically.
Surgical pancreatic adenocarcinoma specimens (3
x 3 mm pieces) were implanted subcutaneously into the
flanks of anesthetized NOD/SCID mice [29, 30]. Stable
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines were obtained after
passaging the tumors three times. These tumors were
implanted subcutaneously into the right flanks of athymic
female nude mice (6 weeks old, National Cancer Institute
Laboratories), and treatment began when tumors reached
5-6 mm in diameter. Mice were treated daily with i.p.
injections of 375 nanomoles SW V-49 or control for 14
days. For all survival experiments, mice were euthanized
and considered dead when the tumors reached a diameter
of 2 cm or had ulcerated.
Syngeneic orthotopic pancreatic cancer tumors
were established by surgical implantation. C57BL/6 mice
(8 weeks old, Jackson Laboratory) were injected in the
tail of the pancreas with 50 µL single-cell suspension
of KP-2 cells (2.5 x 105 cells per mouse) in Matrigel
(Corning). On day 7 gross palpation revealed a tumor
and mice were treated twice weekly with i.p. injections
of 20 mg/kg gemcitabine (Tocris) or daily with 200
nanomoles SW V-49 for two weeks. Vehicle was used as a
control. C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old, Jackson Laboratory)
were injected in the right flank with 100 µL single-cell
suspension of KCKO cells (2.5 x 105 cells per mouse) in
PBS to create a syngeneic subcutaneous model. Treatment
began when the tumors reached 5-6 mm in diameter. Mice
were treated twice weekly with i.p. injections of 20 mg/kg
gemcitabine (Tocris) or 200 nanomoles SW V-49 for three
weeks. Vehicle was used as control.

Cystine uptake assay was performed as previously
described [7]. Briefly, 5 x 105 AsPC-1 cells/well were
seeded overnight in a 6-well plate. Cells were washed
twice in pre-warmed Na+-free uptake buffer (137 mM
choline chloride, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2,
5 mM D-glucose, 0.7 mM K2HPO4, and 10 mM HEPES
[pH 7.4]). Cells were incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C in
1 mL of uptake buffer to deplete cellular amino acids. This
buffer was replaced with 600 μL uptake buffer containing
200 µM of compound (SW V-49, SV119, dm-Erastin, or
an equimolar mix of SV119 and dm-Erastin) and 0.12 μCi
(80 - 110 mCi/mmol) of L-[3,3′-14C]-cystine (American
Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) and incubated
for 3 minutes at 37°C. DMSO was used as a control.
Cells were washed three times with ice-cold uptake buffer
and lysed in 500 μL of 0.1 M NaOH. To this lysate, 1
mL of scintillation fluid was added and radioactive counts
per minute were obtained using a scintillation counter
(Beckman instruments, Fullerton, CA.). Experiment was
performed in triplicates.

Detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
ROS measurement was performed using Total
ROS/Superoxide Detection Kit (Enzo Life Sciences,
Farmingdale, NY) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, AsPC-1 cells were seeded at a
density of 2 x 104 cells/well in black clear-bottom 96-well
plates for 24 hours prior to treatment. Cells were treated
with 8 µM SV119, Erastin, SW V-49, or an equimolar
concentration of SV119 and Erastin. DMSO was used as
a control. One hour post-treatment, culture supernatants
were removed and replaced with 100 µL/well of ROS/
Superoxide Detection Mix reagent. Fluorescent signal was
measured using a multi-mode microplate reader (Bio-Tek).
The assay was performed in 6 replicates.

Inhibition of SW V-49-mediated ROS production
with N-acetyl cysteine

SW V-49 uptake studies by pancreatic cancer cells
AsPC-1 cells (5 × 105/well) were seeded into 6-well
plates 24 hours before treatment. The cells were incubated
for 30 minutes at 37°C with 0 (control), 10, 30 and 50
μM of SW V-49 followed by addition of the fluorescently
labeled sigma-2 ligand SW120 (10 nM). Thirty minutes
after SW120 addition, the cells were washed twice with
PBS and harvested with trypsin/EDTA buffer. The cells
were washed twice with PBS, and SW120 internalization
blockade by SW V-49 was determined by flow cytometry
(FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

AsPC-1 cells were plated at a density of 2 x 104
cells/well in opaque 96-well, clear-bottom plates 24
hours prior to treatment. Cells were treated with N-acetyl
cysteine (10 mM) or vehicle and exposed to SW V-49 (10
µM) for 5 hours. CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability
Assay was performed. Assay was performed in triplicate.

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses and data plotting were
performed using GraphPad Prism software version 6.03
(San Diego, CA) in consultation with JL (biostatistician).

Results were expressed as mean ± standard error of the
mean of at least 3 biological replicates. IC50 values were
calculated by curve fitting normalized viability versus
drug concentration. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze
the differences in IC50 values and SW V-49 inhibition with
NAC tests. Student’s two-tailed unpaired t-tests were
used to evaluate the difference in SW V-49 tissue uptake,
cystine uptake, ROS production, and tumor volume.
Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the difference
in CBC and biochemistry analyses. Kaplan-Meier
survival analyses were used to assess differences between
treatment groups and were compared using a log-rank
test. Survival is reported as median survival ± standard
deviation. Repeated measures ANOVA was used for
analysis of tumor size. A p-value < 0.05 was considered
significant for all analyses.
