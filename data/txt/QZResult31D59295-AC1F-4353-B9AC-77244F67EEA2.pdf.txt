ABSTRACT:

In this Phase 2 study, we evaluated the efficacy of combination of 5-azacitidine (AZA),
valproic acid (VPA), and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in patients with high-risk acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Treatment consisted of
six cycles of AZA and VPA for 7 days, followed by ATRA for 21 days. Sixty-five patients
were enrolled (median age, 72 years; 55 AML including 13 relapsed/refractory
patients, 10 MDS; 30 unfavorable karyotypes). Best responses included 14 CR and 3 PR
(26%), 75% of the responders and 36% of the non-responders achieving an erythroid
response. Median overall survival (OS) was 12.4 months. Untreated patients had a
longer OS than relapsed/refractory patients. In patients who fulfilled the 6 planned
cycles, OS did not appear to depend on CR/PR achievement, suggesting that stable
disease while on-treatment would be a surrogate for survival with this approach.
During therapy, early platelet response and demethylation of the FZD9, ALOX12, HPN,
and CALCA genes were associated with clinical response. Finally, there was no evidence
for the restoration of an ATRA-induced differentiation during therapy.
Epigenetic modulation deserves prospective comparisons to conventional care in
patients with high-risk AML, at least in those presenting previously untreated disease
and low blast count.

INTRODUCTION

2 very early deaths). The main causes of treatment discontinuation were disease progression (8 patients) and death
(15 patients). Death was related to or concomitant of disease progression in 5 of these 15 patients. Nine patients
died from infection and another one died from myocardial
infarction. Only 3 patients withdrew their consent during
the study time.

Chromatine remodeling through DNA demethylation
has been investigated for many years as a potential anticancer therapeutic approach [1]. Two DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, 5-azacytidine (AZA) and decitabine, have
demonstrated clinical activity as single agents in patients
with MDS/AML [2-7]. Both drugs are registered in the US
to treat patients with MDS. Based on a large confirmatory
study [8], AZA has recently obtained an EMEA approval
to treat patients with high-risk MDS and AML until 30%
marrow blasts, as the survival benefit over conventional
care regimens was also observed in the subgroup of patients
with low bone marrow blast count AML [9].
Another way to modulate the epigenetic chromatine
structure is to use histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.
It has been shown for instance that the resistance to all-trans
retinoic acid (ATRA) observed in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells carrying the variant PLZF-RARA fusion
protein may be abrogated by HDAC inhibitors (HDACi)
such as trichostatin A or sodium phenylbutyrate in vitro or
in vivo [10-11]. Valproic acid (VPA) has been demonstrated
as belonging to the HDACi family and, interestingly, combined VPA/ATRA treatment may also induce hematological
responses in patients with non-APL AML or MDS [12-14].
In this Phase 2 study, we thus evaluated the efficacy
of AZA/VPA/ATRA combination in patients with high-risk
AML or MDS. Focusing on differential analysis between
responders and non-responders, DNA methylation profile
analysis confirmed that epigenetic modulation occurs in
vivo and may be linked to drug efficacy.

Patients
A total of 65 patients (median age, 72 years; ranging
from 50 to 87) entered the study. Patient characteristics are
shown in Table 1. The numbers of patients were 42, 13, and
10 in eligibility subset 1, 2, and 3, respectively. All patients
with refractory/relapsed AML had previously received
intensive chemotherapy. The proportion of patients with
unfavorable cytogenetics was high (52%); no patient had
favorable core binding factor AML. Median WBC and
percentage of marrow blasts were low, suggesting that a
selection of patients with slowly progressing disease may
have occurred. At the reference date of analysis, the median
follow-up was 16.3 months, ranging from 14 to 28.

No complete (CR) or partial (PR) remission was

received the first 3 cycles, 8 (18%) were in CR and 3 (7%)
in PR at that time (Table 2). Among the 34 patients who
received the six planned cycles, 13 (38%) achieved CR
and 2 (6%) achieved PR (Table 2). Best responses were,
however, 14 CR and 3 PR (26%), as some patients lost
their response between cycle 3 and 6. Responses were
seen within the three eligibility subsets: 11 CR and 2 PR
in newly-diagnosed elderly patients, 2 CR and 1 PR in
relapsed/refractory patients, and 1 CR in high-risk MDS
patients (P= 0.47). Among the 15 patients alive in response
after cycle 6, 14 patients received further maintenance
treatments with AZA alone (7 patients) or low-dose cytara-

6 cycles. Erythroid response was never observed after the
first cycle, but 10% of the responders and 12.5% of the
non-responders reached it after 3 cycles.
Factors usually associated with the outcome of AML/
MDS patients (age, PS, cytogenetics, and disease status)
predicted death before response during therapy. These factors, including cytogenetics, did not, however, predict the
response. The only factor associated with a lower response
incidence was a low platelet count (18% CR + PR in the
24 patients with initial platelet count < 50.109/L). In addition, early platelet recovery after the first cycle was significantly associated with a higher response rate (P< 0.001
for platelet count as a continuous variable). Response incidence reached 57% in patients with a platelet count of 100
x 109/L or more after the first cycle compared to 12% in
other patients (P= 0.001).

Median PB neutrophil count, platelet count, and Hb
level observed during therapy in the 34 patients who
received the 6 planned treatment cycles are shown in
Figure 1 according to the 6-month response (15 responding and 19 non-responding patients). As indicated, platelet
count improvement was the earliest feature observed in
responding patients. Stable PB counts or partial improvements were, however, observed in non-responding patients.
With respect to erythroid response, 75% of the responders

Toxicity

not seem to be significantly influenced by CR or PR obtention. Factors previously shown to be associated with death
during therapy (age, PS, cytogenetics, and disease status)
were also predictive of OS. Based on multivariable Cox
model, only PS and unfavorable cytogenetics were associated with a shorter OS.

Main adverse events are reported in Table 3. If one
except fatigue, infections, and hemorrhages usually
observed in AML patients, the toxicities observed may
readily be related to one of the three drugs administered.
Somnolence and confusion related to VPA led to amend the
starting VPA dose after the first 11 patients. Gastro-intestinal events were probably related to AZA, as were pain
at the AZA injection sites and fatigue. Mucosal dryness
is a well-known side effect of ATRA. In the 34 patients
who received the 6 cycles, re-hospitalization rate was 29%,
38%, 23%, 18%, 15%, and 15% after cycle 1 to 6, respectively.

Genome methylation
Baseline methylation profiles were available in 28
patients. After excluding sexual chromosome-related
sites, 1421 regulatory regions were analyzed. Methylation profiles were bimodal with 454 sites with a median
methylation of 50% or more (32%). Methylation profiles
were relatively similar among patients and unsupervised
clustering did not allow identifying subgroups with different patterns, even when focusing on hypermethylated
loci (data not shown). Similarly, supervised clustering did
not allow to allocate specific signatures to various patient
subsets defined by age, gender, PS, WBC, platelet count,
percentage of marrow blasts, disease status, cytogenetics,
or even response to therapy. After adjustment for multiple
testing, only one site showed significant correlation with
WBC (PMP22, P=0.04) and another with marrow blast
percentage (TFDP1, P=0.01), but no site was significantly
differently methylated at baseline between responders and
non-responders.	

Survival
Figure 2A shows OS in the 65 enrolled patients, according to the eligibility subsets. Median OS was 12.4 months
for the whole patient cohort, with a significant difference
between naïve AML/MDS patients and relapsing patients
(18.1 versus 2.9 months; P= 0.0024). Median OS of the
17 responders was 19.6 months. In the 34 patients who
received the 6 planned cycles, OS from 6-month evaluation was not significantly different between responding and
non-responding patients (Figure 2B), meaning that the survival of patients who were still on therapy at that time did

Induction of differentiation
There was no evidence supporting the hypothesis of
ATRA-induced differentiation restoration, even in responding patients. Morphological features suggesting in vivo differentiation of AML blasts, reminiscent of those observed
in APL patients under ATRA treatment, were observed in
one CR patient only. Unfortunately, this patient did not
have cytogenetic aberration that could have been monitored to further support this hypothesis. No clinical symptoms suggesting any differentiation syndrome were noted.
In addition, no clear demethylation was observed at various
retinoic acid target gene loci during therapy. Retinoic acid
receptor alpha (RARA) and beta (RARB) gene promoters
were rather hypomethylated at baseline and no significant
change in their methylation levels was observed during
therapy (Table 4B). Although demethylation of the two
RBP1 loci appeared slightly superior in responding than
in non-responding patients, no clear differences between
responding and non-responding patients were observed for
three other CDKN1A, RBP1, and ETS1 retinoic acid target
genes.

DISCUSSION

of hematological response.
Maybe due to the low number of patients studied, we
were unable to find specific methylation profile signatures
that distinguished responders from non-responders. We
nonetheless identified a set of four genes that were markedly demethylated in responding patients, while unchanged
in non-responding patients. Interestingly, these four genes
(FZD9, ALOX12, HPN, and CALCA) have been recently
reported as aberrantly methylated in MDS/AML patients
during the progression from MDS to AML [25]. Among
these genes, FZD9 is a receptor of Wnt and a putative
tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 7. It is thus
tempting to consider that patients responding to epigenetic
modulation might somehow “return” to a less advanced
pre-leukemic state. In the British study mentioned above
[19], it was observed that some patients may reach CR with
good restoration of marrow progenitor quantity and quality, while still harboring persistent malignant stem cells
[19]. If confirmed, these observations should encourage
further approaches to maintain long lasting responses in
these patients, including stem cell transplantation, immunomodulators, or even vaccination.
In conclusion, as shown by the median OS reported
here, epigenetic modulation deserves now direct randomized comparisons to other conventional care regimens in
older patients with AML, at least in those presenting previously untreated disease and relatively low blast count.
Identification of reliable biomarkers that could predict
response to these new therapies remains an important issue
to select patients most likely to derive a prolonged benefit
from these treatments.

We report here a 26% response rate including 22% CR
associated with AZA/VPA/ATRA treatment in patients with
high-risk AML or MDS. Even if selected, the 65 patients
enrolled were clearly at high risk of treatment failure: their
median age was over 70 years and, more importantly, half
of them had very unfavorable cytogenetic features. Similar
response rates have been reported using various combination of the same drugs, even if using different schedules
[18-19]. In the first study from the M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center (MDACC) which included a much shorter ATRA
exposure (5 days per cycle, from day 3 to 7), the overall
CR rate was 23% [18]. As in the present study, responses
were observed across the different risk subsets including
unfavorable cytogenetics. In the British study which added
theophylline to AZA/VPA/ATRA as a fourth pro-differentiating agent, the overall CR/CRi/PR rate was 33% [19].
It appears thus that ATRA does not add any significant
clinical benefit to treatments based on epigenetic modifying
drugs. Various 2-drug or even 1-drug regimens with DNA
methyltransferase inhibitors and/or HDACi have antiAML efficacy [2-10, 20] and response rates observed in
these three ATRA-containing studies are not clearly superior. Furthermore, similar response rates were observed
when using either 5 days of ATRA administration per treatment cycle, as in the MDACC study [8], or 21 days, as in
the present study. In addition, we were unable to provide
observations supporting a significant differentiating effect
of ATRA when combined to AZA/VPA in such non-APL
patients.
Whether the superiority of AZA/HDACi combinations
over the single-agent AZA therapy remains questionable,
as no controlled study has yet prospectively addressed this
issue. Some in vitro data are in favor of additive or synergistic effects when adding VPA to a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor [21]. The single randomized Phase 2 study
which has addressed this issue in MDS/AML patients has
used decitabine but not AZA, and reported only marginal
response rate and time to response improvements without impact on survival [22]. Of interest, combinations of
azacitidine with newer and potentially less toxic HDACi,
such as vorinostat or entinostat, have also been reported as
associated with good response rates [23-24].
The present study provides two additional important
clinical observations. The first one is the prognostic value
of a rapid platelet count recovery, often observed as soon as
during the first cycle in responders and suggesting a direct
effect of any component of the treatment on the megakaryocytic lineage. The second one is the apparent good
outcome of patients who did not reach CR or PR but may
receive the whole planned treatment. Similar results were
recently reported in high-risk MDS patients [8]. This confers an unusual feature to AZA, which appears as a drug
able to significantly prolong survival even in the absence

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study design and treatments
The study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID, NCT00339196) was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the Pitié-Salpêtrière
Hospital, sponsored by the Délegation à la Recherche
Clinique (DRRC ID, P050202), and conducted between
2006 and 2007 in 9 French centers. All patients signed
informed consent in accordance to the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients were planned to receive six monthly cycles
of AZA/VPA/ATRA. AZA was given subcutaneously at
75 mg/m2/d in combination with oral VPA at 35 to 50 mg/
kg/d, both for 7 days (day 1 to 7). ATRA was then given
orally at 45 mg/m2/d from day 8 to 28. Patients were
admitted in hospitals for cycle 1, while they were treated
on an outpatient basis for cycles 2-6, which were repeated
whatever peripheral blood (PB) counts but not earlier than
every 4 weeks. At the onset of the study, VPA was started
at 50 mg/kg/d in all patients. After enrolment of the first
11 patients, excessive VPA-induced neurological toxicity
observed in some patients led the independent Data Safety
39

and Monitoring Committee to recommend a 35 mg/kg/d
VPA starting dose for the first cycle, that could then be
increased to 50 mg/kg/d for subsequent cycles if clinically
tolerated. Supportive care measures including antibiotics,
antiemetics, and growth factors were allowed if clinically
indicated and according to institutional guidelines. After
the 6th cycle, responding patients could receive further
maintenance treatments.

oligos are then extended and ligated to create amplifiable
templates. The PCR that follows uses fluorescently labeled
universal PCR primers. The resulting PCR products were
hybridized to a bead array at sites bearing complementary
address sequences. These hybridized targets contained a
fluorescent label that tagged methylated or unmethylated
sequences at a given locus. Methylation status of the interrogated CpG sites was determined by comparing the ratio
of the fluorescent signal from the methylated allele to the
sum from the fluorescent signals of both methylated and
unmethylated alleles yielding a percentage of methylation
at each site. The GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I
assay probes 1505 CpG sites from the 5’ regulatory regions
of 807 cancer-associated genes on 23 chromosomes.

Eligibility criteria
High-risk AML was defined as newly-diagnosed previously untreated AML in patients aged 70 years or more
unlikely to benefit from standard intensive chemotherapy
(subset 1) or relapsed/refractory AML in patients with
a first CR duration < 18 months and/or post-MDS AML
(subset 2). High-risk MDS was defined as refractory
anemia with excess blasts or refractory anemia with excess
blasts in transformation with an intermediate-2 or high
International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score [15]
(subset 3). Eligibility criteria also included an ECOG performance status (PS) score not higher than 3 and adequate
hepatic and renal functions. Patients must have been off
chemotherapy or other investigational therapy for at least
4 weeks prior study entry and not previously treated with
AZA, VPA, or ATRA. Patients with APL or central nervous
system leukemic involvement, or patients with active or
uncontrolled infection were excluded, as well as those with
a white blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 30 x 109/L. Pre-treatment
with hydoxyurea was allowed, but had to be interrupted at
least 48 hours prior to study entry.

Statistical methods
Analysis was performed on the intent-to-treat basis.
Cumulative incidences of response were estimated considering treatment discontinuation and death before response
as competing risks and compared with the Gray test.
Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier
method, with reference date of November 15th, 2008. Survival comparisons were based on Cox proportional hazards models. The following factors were analyzed for their
prognostic value: gender, age, PS, WBC, platelet counts,
marrow blast percentage, cytogenetics, and relapsed/
refractory status. All statistical tests were two-sided. For
DNA methylation assay analysis, the 84 regulatory regions
located on sexual chromosomes were excluded. The raw
profiles were normalized using quantile normalization.
Unsupervised clustering was applied using the euclidean
distance. Initial methylation profiles were correlated with
baseline characteristics and response at 6 months using the
Spearman correlation coefficient. Changes in methylation
levels were investigated in a subset of patients for whom a
second methylation profile was available after initiation of
treatment. Multiple testing correction was applied using the
Bonferroni single step method for P values. All analyses
were performed on SAS 9.1 (SAS, Cary, NC) and R 2.8.0
software packages (http://www.R-project.org).

Cytogenetic and response classification
Unfavorable cytogenetics was defined as -7, del(7q),
-5, 3q abnormality, or complex (5 anomalies or more). All
other karyotypes were classified in a standard-risk group.
Bone marrow and PB response was assessed after cycle 1,
3, and 6, and classified according to the International Working Group (IWG) AML criteria [16]. Erythroid response
(ER) was defined according to IWG MDS criteria [17].
Genome methylation assay

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Marrow samples were obtained at baseline in 28 patients
and under therapy in 8 patients. Mononuclear cells were
isolated using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France). Genomic DNA was prepared using
the DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France)
and then subjected to sodium bisulfite conversion using the
EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Reseach, Orange, CA).
DNA methylation profiles were determined using the GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I (Illumina, San Diego,
CA). Briefly, bisulfite-converted DNAs are biotinylated,
hybridized to query oligos, and washed. The hybridized
