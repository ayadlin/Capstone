Abstract
HER2/HER3 dimerization resulting from overexpression of HER2 or neuregulin (NRG1) in cancer leads to
HER3-mediated oncogenic activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Although ligand-blocking HER3 antibodies inhibit NRG1-driven tumor growth, they are ineffective against HER2-driven tumor
growth because HER2 activates HER3 in a ligand-independent manner. In this study, we describe a novel
HER3 monoclonal antibody (LJM716) that can neutralize multiple modes of HER3 activation, making it a
superior candidate for clinical translation as a therapeutic candidate. LJM716 was a potent inhibitor of
HER3/AKT phosphorylation and proliferation in HER2-ampliﬁed and NRG1-expressing cancer cells, and it
displayed single-agent efﬁcacy in tumor xenograft models. Combining LJM716 with agents that target HER2
or EGFR produced synergistic antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. In particular, combining LJM716 with
trastuzumab produced a more potent inhibition of signaling and cell proliferation than trastuzumab/
pertuzumab combinations with similar activity in vivo. To elucidate its mechanism of action, we solved the
structure of LJM716 bound to HER3, ﬁnding that LJM716 bound to an epitope, within domains 2 and 4, that
traps HER3 in an inactive conformation. Taken together, our ﬁndings establish that LJM716 possesses a novel
mechanism of action that, in combination with HER2- or EGFR-targeted agents, may leverage their clinical
efﬁcacy in ErbB-driven cancers. Cancer Res; 73(19); 6024–35. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
In clinical practice, the HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) is central to the treatment of
HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer. Although trastuzumab has
well-established clinical beneﬁt, responses are transient and
patients frequently relapse with trastuzumab-resistant dis-

ease (1). A number of trastuzumab resistance mechanisms
have been proposed that most commonly center on sustained phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling (2, 3)
either due to the presence of activating PI3K mutations
(4, 5), PTEN inactivation (4, 5), or persistent HER3 signaling
(6, 7). HER3 is the preferred dimerization partner of HER2
(8), acting as an allosteric activator of its partner kinase (9).
Activation of the HER2–HER3 complex results in transphosphorylation of HER3 and initiation of downstream
signaling. HER2–HER3 activates PI3K signaling via HER3,
which in contrast to other ErbB receptors contains multiple
phosphodependent binding sites for the regulatory p85
subunit of PI3K (10).
In HER2 ampliﬁed cancer, activation of HER3 may occur
through high-level expression of heterodimerization partners such as HER2 (11). Consequently, in cases of HER2
ampliﬁcation, HER2–HER3 heterodimer formation occurs in
a ligand-independent manner, resulting in unrestrained
HER3 signaling that is both necessary (12) and sufﬁcient
(13) for transformation. Indeed, human HER2-ampliﬁed
breast cancer samples harbor high levels of phosphorylated
HER3, indicative of HER3 activation and infrequent concomitant NRG1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S1A–1D and
Table S1; ref. 14). Continued HER3 signaling in the presence
of trastuzumab or PI3K inhibitors might also be driven by

Locking HER3 in the Inactive Conformation

FOXO-dependent induction of HER3 expression (15–17) via
the release of a PI3K/AKT-driven inhibitory feedback loop
(7, 18).
The HER2-targeted antibody pertuzumab (Perjeta) reportedly inhibits ligand-induced HER3 activity by preventing
HER2/HER3 dimerization (3, 19). The recent CLEOPATRA
study (20) showed that the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab/docetaxel signiﬁcantly prolonged progression-free
survival when used as ﬁrst-line treatment in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. However, recent preclinical reports indicate that even dual HER2 blockade is unable to fully inhibit
PI3K/AKT signaling, and superior beneﬁt may be achieved
with HER3-speciﬁc inhibition (21).
Elevated expression of NRG1 drives ligand-dependent HER3
signaling and functional NRG1/HER3 autocrine loops have
been identiﬁed in models of squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck (SCCHN; ref. 22) and ovarian cancer (23). Given
that both ligand-dependent and independent HER3 activation
appear to be of fundamental importance in multiple tumor
types, a therapeutic agent capable of inhibiting both of these
modes of HER3 activation may be efﬁcacious in multiple
indications.
Here we describe the discovery, biologic activity, and
molecular mode of action of a fully human antibody
(LJM716) currently in clinical testing. LJM716 is capable of
neutralizing both ligand-dependent and independent HER3
signaling and data suggest this occurs by locking HER3 in
the inactive conformation. In addition, we present in vitro
and in vivo data that highlight the potential clinical beneﬁt
of combining LJM716 with both HER2- and EGFR-targeted
agents.

Materials and Methods
Recombinant proteins
Recombinant monomeric HER3 extracellular domains
(ECD) from human, rat, and cynomolgus monkey, as well as
isolated HER3 domains (D1-2, D2, D3-4, and D4) were cloned
upstream of a C-terminal afﬁnity tag, sequence-veriﬁed,
expressed in HEK293-derived cells, and puriﬁed using an
anti-tag antibody. Fc-tagged ECDs from three other ErbBfamily proteins (EGFR, HER2, and HER4) were purchased from
R&D Systems. Further details on all recombinant proteins used
can be found in the Supplementary Materials.
Antibodies
HER3-targeted antibodies were selected from the Human
Combinatorial Antibody Library (HuCAL GOLD) using phagedisplay technology (24). The afﬁnity (KD) of the binding interaction between LJM716 and recombinant monomeric HER3
ECD was determined by solution equilibrium titration (SET;
ref. 25).
ELISA binding assays
Maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated with the appropriate recombinant protein and blocked before incubating with the relevant test antibody for two hours at room
temperature. Plates were washed and human antibody

detected using peroxidase linked goat anti-human antibody (Pierce).
Immunoblotting
For immunoblots, cell lysates were prepared in 1% NP-40
buffer including protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche)
and analyzed by Western blot using the Odyssey detection
system (Licor) or by enhanced chemiluminescence after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Promega). Details of antibodies used are in the
Supplementary Material.

Locking HER3 in the Inactive Conformation

pHER3 and pAKT assays
pHER3 and pAKT were measured by Meso Scale Discovery
(MSD) assay. Brieﬂy, cell or tumor lysates were prepared in NP40 lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors, followed by capture of the analyte on an MSD plate
and detection with a phosphospeciﬁc primary antibody and
Sulfo-tagged secondary immunoglobulin G (IgG). Supplementary Materials contain details.
In vitro proliferation assays
For single-agent growth assays, cells were seeded onto 96well plates (Costar #3904) at 5,000 cells/well, treated with the
appropriate concentration of the indicated drug, and incubated
for three to ﬁve days at 37 C. Cell viability was quantiﬁed by the
addition of CellTiterGlo reagent (Promega). For drug combination treatments, the procedure was the same except that cells
were plated into 384-well plates (Greiner #781091) at 1,000 cells/
well. Percent growth inhibition was calculated by normalizing
raw luminescence values to that of untreated wells.
FACS and cellular NRG1-blocking assays
Binding of HER3 antibodies and NRG1 blocking was determined using ﬂow cytometry. Details are presented in the
Supplementary Materials.
HER3 crystallography
The MOR09825–HER3 complex was prepared by mixing
tagged HER3 ECD (residues 20-640) with Escherichia coliexpressed MOR09825 Fab and then purifying the complex on
a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare). Data were
collected on a crystal cooled to 100K using a Dectris Pilatus
6M detector and synchrotron radiation (l ¼ 1.0000Å) at the
IMCA-CAT beam line 17-ID of the Advanced Photon Source
at Argonne National Laboratory. For details on data processing and modeling, refer to Supplementary Materials.
In vivo studies
For xenograft studies, female athymic nu/nu Balb/C (Harlan
Laboratories) or NOD SCID Gamma (NSG; Jackson Labs) mice
were implanted with BT-474, BxPC-3, FaDu, KPL4, L3.3, N87,
T3M4, and Hara cells. Mice were treated with 20 mg/kg trastuzumab (every second week), 20 mg/kg LJM716 (every other
day), 20 mg/kg pertuzumab (every second week), cetuximab 20
mg/kg (every second week), or 100 mg/kg lapatinib (daily).
Further details on the in vivo efﬁcacy and pharmacodynamic

Results
Discovery of an anti-HER3 antibody that inhibits both
ligand-dependent and -independent HER3 activity
in vitro
Previous short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) data have shown
that loss of HER3 expression in HER2-ampliﬁed models is
sufﬁcient to inhibit cell proliferation (14). Treatment of the
HER3 shRNA-sensitive cell line SKBR-3 with commercially
available HER3-targeted antibodies further validates the
ability to modulate cell growth in this setting from the
extracellular compartment. AF234 (a HER3-speciﬁc goat
polyclonal) induced signiﬁcant inhibition of growth, whereas MAB3481, a ligand-blocking mouse monoclonal, had little
to no effect (Fig. 1A). The greater activity observed with
AF234 was correlated with its more robust downregulation
of HER3 and prolonged inhibition of pAKT (Fig. 1B). Thus,
antibodies that simply block ligand binding to HER3 and fail
to inhibit AKT phosphorylation are unlikely to be active in
this setting.
To identify a HER3 therapeutic antibody capable of inhibiting both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent HER3 signaling, we isolated HER3-targeted Fabs using MorphoSys
HuCAL phage-display technology (24) against a number of
recombinant HER3 antigens. Corresponding full IgGs were
screened for their ability to neutralize HER3 tyrosine phosphorylation and cell proliferation driven by either HER2
(SKBR3 cells) or NRG1 (MCF7 cells). From all conﬁrmed hits,
only four antibodies were capable of effectively inhibiting
HER2-driven HER3 phosphorylation and proliferation in
SKBR-3 cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, a large number of antibodies
efﬁciently inhibited HER3 phosphorylation and cell proliferation in NRG1-stimulated MCF7 cells (Fig. 1D) due to their
ability to prevent ligand binding (data not shown). Three
antibodies were active in both settings (Fig. 1C and D),

suggesting they may be uniquely capable of inhibiting multiple
modes of HER3 activation. The sequence of these antibodies
differed only in residues contained within hCDR2 and, thus,
these antibodies were highly related and are referred to herein
as Family 15.

cells. The inhibitory activity of LJM716 similarly led to
inhibition of PI3K pathway signaling including downregulation of AKT phosphorylation (pAKT S473; Supplementary Fig.

potent inhibitor of ligand-dependent and -independent
HER3 signaling and growth.
LJM716 displays single-agent activity in HER2- and
NRG1-driven in vivo models
Having established that LJM716 inhibits multiple modes
of HER3 activation in vitro, we next asked whether this
activity was maintained in vivo. SCID mice bearing HER2ampliﬁed BT474 breast cancer xenografts were treated with
a single-dose of 20 mg/kg LJM716, resulting in maximal
reduction of pHER3 by 52% and pAKT by 84% over a 24-hour
period when compared with an equivalent dose of an isotype
control antibody (Fig. 2A). Similarly, in SCID mice bearing
ligand-expressing BxPC-3 pancreatic xenografts, intravenous dosing of 20 mg/kg LJM716 resulted in 86% maximal
inhibition of pHER3 and 74% inhibition of pAKT compared
with isotype-matched treated controls (Fig. 2B). These pharmacodynamic studies show that LJM716 is capable of inhibiting both HER2- and ligand-mediated HER3 signaling in
vivo as evidenced by decreased pHER3/pAKT in both xenograft models.
LJM716 displayed signiﬁcant antitumor activity in BT474
(17% T/C) and HBCx-13A (7.7% T/C) HER2-ampliﬁed xenografts (Fig. 2C and D). Treatment of SCID mice bearing NRG1expressing xenografts with 20 mg/kg LJM716 induced tumor
regression in FaDu (SCCHN), tumor stasis in Hara (lung), and
signiﬁcant (T/C < 25%) tumor growth inhibition in BxPC-3 and
T3M4 (pancreatic) xenografts (Fig. 2E and F, Supplementary
Table S5). LJM716 is, therefore, efﬁcacious in HER2-ampliﬁed
and NRG1-expressing tumor models in vivo.
LJM716 traps HER3 in the inactive conformation
In an effort to understand the mechanism by which LJM716
inhibits HER3, the epitope was identiﬁed by determining
the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Fab fragment
of MOR09825 bound to the HER3 extracellular domain.
MOR09825, the parent Fab molecule of LJM716, has identical
CDR regions and an identical biologic proﬁle to LJM716 (data
not shown). The 3.4Å crystal structure reveals that MOR09825
binds to HER3 in the tethered (inactive) ErbB conformation
and recognizes a nonlinear epitope formed by two distinct
domains D2 and D4 (Fig. 3A). The epitope is centered over the
D2/D4 interface with a similar occluded surface area for each
domain (D2-706 Å2; D4-546 Å2; Fig. 3B). This unique binding
mode has not been previously observed with other ErbBtargeted antibodies and can only occur when domains 2 and
4 are juxtaposed in the tethered (inactive) HER3 conformation
(27–29). The structure also reveals that the antibody heavy
chain and light chain contribute approximately equally to the
recognition of HER3 with the paratope comprising all three
heavy chain CDRs and two light chain CDRs (Supplementary
Fig. S3B).

The crystallographically deﬁned epitope is corroborated
by biochemical characterization of the anti-HER3/HER3
interaction. ELISA characterization of MOR09825 and other
Family 15 members binding to recombinantly expressed
HER3 domains and ECD shows that binding is only detected
for the full ECD construct. No binding is observed for constructs containing isolated domains or domain pairs, D1-D2,
D2, D3–4, or D4 (Supplementary Fig. S3C). In addition,
inspection of the crystal structure indicated that HER3 residues Lys267 and Leu268 located within the D2 b-hairpin
dimerization arm are involved in numerous interactions with
both the heavy and light chains of the antibody (Fig. 3C),
suggesting they may be fundamentally important for binding.
Mutation of Lys267 and/or Leu268 to alanine abolishes
LJM716 binding (Fig. 3D), whereas binding of a D3-targeted
antibody is largely unaffected by these mutations (Supplementary Fig. S3D). These data show that residues within the
b-hairpin dimerization arm are an integral part of the LJM716
epitope. We conclude that binding of LJM716 locks HER3 in
the inactive conformation, thus preventing the large-scale
structural rearrangements required for transition of HER3 to
the extended conformation characteristic of activated ErbB
receptors (30–32).
LJM716 does not prevent neuregulin binding to HER3
The crystal structure indicated that the ligand-binding site of
HER3, which has been mapped to D1 and D3 by analogy to EGFR
(31, 32), was not occluded by Fab binding (Fig. 3A and B). We
explored the impact of LJM716 upon the HER3–NRG1 interaction. LJM716–HER3 complexes were preformed and passed over
a surface plasmon resonance biosensor chip previously coated
with NRG1. LJM716/HER3 complexes were capable of binding
immobilized NRG1 whereas a complex comprised of HER3 and
a ligand-blocking HER3 antibody (MOR09624) prevented binding to NRG1 (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, the presence of LJM716 had
no signiﬁcant impact on the binding afﬁnity of HER3 for NRG1
(Supplementary Fig. S4), indicating that LJM716 does not
inﬂuence NRG1 binding in biochemical assays. The afﬁnity of
NRG1 was consistent with that previously determined using a
mutant form of HER3 that is in the locked conformation (33). To
conﬁrm these results in a cell-based system, we tested whether
MCF7 cells pre-bound with LJM716 were capable of binding
NRG1. Using ﬂow cytometry we found that pre-binding of MCF7
with LJM716 had no impact on subsequent binding by NRG1
(Fig. 3F). These ﬁndings strongly suggest that the LJM716
epitope is not essential for ligand binding and that LJM716 and
NRG1 can bind concurrently.

incomplete PI3K pathway suppression (2, 3). When we tested
the ability of trastuzumab to inhibit pHER3 in a panel of HER2ampliﬁed cell line models grown in full serum, robust (>50%)
pHER3 inhibition was observed in only 3/19 cell lines (Fig. 4A).
In contrast, LJM716 treatment was more broadly active, lowering the IC50 of pHER3 inhibition (e.g., MDA-MB-453) as well
as enhancing maximal inhibition (e.g., NCI-N87), so that 14/18
cell lines showed robust (>50%) pHER3 inhibition (Fig. 4A and
B). LJM716 induced inhibition of pAKT in a subset of cell lines
(Fig. 4A), all of which contained high levels of HER3 phosphorylation, and in these cell lines, LJM716 was capable of
inducing growth inhibition (Fig. 4C, Supplementary Fig. S1A
and E). Trastuzumab similarly induced inhibition of pAKT (Fig.
4A) and proliferation (Fig. 4C) in an overlapping subset of cell
lines despite its inability to effectively inhibit HER3. These
data may indicate that HER2 can activate PI3K signaling in a
HER3-dependent and -independent manner, and that modulation of pAKT may be a key predictor of single-agent activity
for both LJM716 and trastuzumab.
To investigate the consequence of HER2 and HER3 dual
inhibition we determined the growth inhibitory effect of
simultaneously combining LJM716 with trastuzumab. In vitro,
the addition of LJM716 to trastuzumab both increased the
degree of growth inhibition obtained in sensitive cell lines
(e.g., SKBR-3) and also induced a response in cell lines
refractory to either agent alone (e.g., KPL4; Fig. 4C, Supplementary Fig. S7). The efﬁcacy of LJM716/trastuzumab combination was tested in vivo using BT474 xenografts grown in
NSG mice. BT474 xenografts grown in nude mice are exquisitely sensitive to trastuzumab, due in part to its potent ability
to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC; ref. 34). Consequently, NSG mice were used since
they lack functional NK cells in addition to B and T cells, thus
potentially mimicking the impaired ability of trastuzumab to
induce ADCC in those patients possessing low-afﬁnity Fcg
receptor polymorphisms (35). In NSG mice, both LJM716 and
trastuzumab slowed tumor growth when dosed as single
agents (Fig. 4D). The combination of both agents was well
tolerated and showed superior activity compared with either
agent alone, inducing prolonged tumor stasis (Fig. 4D, Supplementary S5A).
Because LJM716 also effectively inhibits NRG1-dependent
HER3 activation, we assessed its activity in models of
SCCHN, a lineage that has recently been shown to be driven
by a NRG1/HER3 autocrine loop (22). LJM716 displayed
single-agent growth inhibitory activity in several of these
cell lines (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, the combination of LJM716
with the EGFR-targeted antibody cetuximab, which is
approved for the treatment of metastatic SCCHN, was more
potent in vitro compared with either single agent (Fig. 4E). In
vivo the LJM716–cetuximab combination was well-tolerated
and capable of completely eradicating FaDu xenograft
tumors (Fig. 4F, Supplementary S5B) and, in this regard,
was superior to either agent alone. These data indicate that
LJM716 can inhibit multiple modes of HER3 activation and
the combination results in enhanced activity with both
HER2- and EGFR-targeted agents in indications driven by
either HER2 or NRG1.

The HER2-targeted antibody pertuzumab, which blocks
dimerization of HER2 with other ligand-activated ErbB
members, was recently approved for treatment of metastatic
breast cancer. We sought to compare the combination activity of trastuzumab–pertuzumab (TþP) with that of trastuzumab–LJM716 (TþL) in a set of HER2-ampliﬁed breast
cancer cell lines. Although TþP and TþL combinations
were both highly potent at inhibiting colony, as well as
3D spheroid formation in the trastuzumab-sensitive cell line
BT474, the LJM716-containing combination was signiﬁcantly more active in trastuzumab-insensitive models like HR6
(36) and MDA-MB-453 cells (Fig. 5A and B, Supplementary
Fig. S6). Increased activity of LJM716 containing treatments
was accompanied by enhanced inhibition of HER3 and AKT
(Fig. 5C). In trastuzumab-sensitive BT474 xenografts in vivo,
TþP and TþL combinations are equally active at inducing
tumor regressions (Fig. 5D, Supplementary Fig. S5C). When
monitoring overall survival following a 35-day dosing period,
both combinations equally prolong survival compared
with either T or P alone (Fig. 5E). These studies show that
addition of LJM716 to trastuzumab is at least as active as the
TþP combination in trastuzumab-sensitive settings, but
enables enhanced inhibition of oncogenic signaling and
proliferation in trastuzumab-resistant settings.

Discussion
Clinical and preclinical data suggest that resistance to
ErbB-targeted therapies occurs frequently and can arise
through a variety of mechanisms. Mounting evidence has
implicated HER3 in resistance to multiple targeted agents
via both ligand-dependent and -independent mechanisms
(37, 38). Through both structural and biochemical studies,
we have shown that LJM716 binds a novel epitope that
speciﬁcally locks HER3 in the inactive conformation. LJM716
binding ensures that the HER3 D2 dimerization arm remains
inaccessible even in the presence of NRG1 or high-levels of
HER2. Therefore, once bound to LJM716, HER3 is unable to
transition to the active conformation and interact with
partner receptors.
LJM716 inhibitory properties result in signiﬁcant tumor
growth inhibition in several different xenograft models that
represent ligand-dependent and -independent modes of
HER3 activation. The LJM716 mechanism of action offers
several potential advantages when attempting to tackle
clinical resistance to targeted agents. Inhibiting multiple
modes of HER3 activation may prevent tumors from circumventing LJM716 activity by simply switching between
ligand-dependent and ligand-independent HER3 activation
as the tumor adapts in response to treatment. Evidence for
an enrichment of HER2 ampliﬁcation was recently shown in
cetuximab-refractory colorectal tumors (39), suggesting that
plasticity in the expression of ErbB-family members known
to activate HER3 is clinically relevant. The ability of LJM716
to lock HER3 in the inactive conformation may also prevent
HER3 activation through the upregulation of alternate heterodimer partners (40). A solely HER2-targeted therapy, like
the trastuzumab–pertuzumab combination is unable to

Locking HER3 in the Inactive Conformation

Figure 5. The addition of LJM716 to trastuzumab enables more potent HER3–PI3K pathway signaling and growth inhibition than trastuzumab–pertuzumab
combination, particularly in trastuzumab-insensitive models. A, cells were plated at 10,000 to 50,000 cells per well in six-well plates and treated in triplicate
with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 10 mg/mL LJM716, pertuzumab, and/or trastuzumab. Media containing antibodies was replenished every three to four
days. Cells were stained with crystal violet when control-treated cells were conﬂuent, ranging from 14 to 21 days. Representative images and quantiﬁcation
of integrated intensity (% control) are shown.  , P < 0.05, t test. B, cells were seeded in Matrigel and allowed to grow in the absence or presence of
10 mg/mL LJM716, pertuzumab, and/or trastuzumab as indicated. Medium was subsequently changed every three days. Images shown were recorded
15 to 19 days after cell seeding. Acini burden was quantiﬁed using the GelCount system. Each bar graph represents the mean þ SEM. of triplicate samples.  , P
< 0.05, t test. C, BT474 and MDA453 cells were treated with 10 mg/mL LJM 716, 10 mg/mL pertuzumab, and/or 10 mg/mL trastuzumab for one or 24 hours.
Whole-cell lysates were prepared and separated in a 7% SDS gel followed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies directed against the indicated
proteins. D, BT474 xenografts were treated with either IgG (20 mg/kg), trastuzumab (20 mg/kg), pertuzumab (20 mg/kg), LJM716 (20 mg/kg, q2d),
trastuzumabþpertuzumab, or trastuzumabþLJM716 for 35 days. Data are presented as mean tumor volume SEM. E, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis

suppress HER3-driven PI3K pathway signaling resulting
from a switch from HER2/3 heterodimers to alternate signaling, such as EGFR/HER3 heterodimers (41). Our data
show that NRG1_EGFR_HER3-driven cell lines are sensitive
to LJM716 inhibition and that dual targeting of EGFR and
HER3 can prevent the emergence of resistance in vivo (Fig.
4E and F). One might speculate that consolidated HER
family inhibition using a triple combination of HER2,
LJM716 (HER3), and EGFR-targeted agents, if tolerated,
could provide additional beneﬁt by restricting possible
routes to resistance through adaptive switching between
HER-family dimers.
HER3 is a central component of many interdependent
signaling pathways activated in cancer. We hypothesize that
combination of LJM716 with either HER2, EGFR, or PI3Ktarged agents may yield a more effective treatment strategy.
Indeed, addition of LJM716 to trastuzumab resulted in
increased inhibition of pAKT and improved in vitro efﬁcacy
exceeding that achieved by the trastuzumab–pertuzumab
combination (Figs. 4B and 5A and C). Interestingly, the presence of PIK3CA hotspot mutations, a clinically validated
mechanism of trastuzumab resistance (2), appears to limit
the added activity contributed by trastuzumab in LJM716–
trastuzumab combinations (Supplementary Fig. S8). Furthermore, the solely HER2-targeted pertuzumab–trastuzumab
combination was less effective than LJM716/trastuzumab in
PIK3CA mutant cells, suggesting that PIK3CA mutations more
dominantly impact sensitivity to HER2 inhibition compared
with HER3 blockade.
The importance of having multiple methods of attacking
oncogenic drivers is further underscored by the recent
identiﬁcation of cetuximab-resistant EGFR mutants that
remained sensitive to panitumumab (42). Because HER2
mutations located within the pertuzumab binding site have
already been identiﬁed in multiple tumor types (43, 44), it is
possible that a similar resistance mechanism may arise in
pertuzumab-treated patients. In these cases, LJM716 may
present a complementary or superior approach for combination therapy with trastuzumab in both breast and gastric
cancers.
In summary, we show that trapping HER3 in the inactive
conformation is a highly effective therapeutic strategy that
may be extended to other receptors, which are also activated in
both a ligand-dependent and -independent manner. Within
the ErbB-family, both HER1 and HER4 can adopt a similar
inactive conformation and, thus, may be targeted using an
analogous approach. As a result of its novel mechanism,
LJM716 displays the unique potential to treat HER2/HER3 as
well as NRG1_EGFR/HER3-driven tumors either as a single

agent or in combination with HER2, EGFR, and PI3K-targeted
agents. LJM716 is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in
HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers, as well as SCCHN.
