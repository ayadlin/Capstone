ABSTRACT
The development of multi-target drugs and irreversible modulators of deregulated
signalling proteins is the major challenge for improving glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) treatment. Reversible single-target drugs are not sufficient to sustain a
therapeutic effect over time and may favour the activation of alternative signalling
pathways and the onset of resistance phenomena. Thus, a multi-target compound
that has a long-lasting mechanism of action might have a greater and longer life
span of anti-proliferative activity. Recently, a dual-target indol-3ylglyoxyldipeptide
derivative, designed to bind to the Translocator Protein (TSPO) and reactivate p53
function via dissociation from its physiological inhibitor, murine double minute 2
(MDM2), has been developed as a potent GBM pro-apoptotic agent. In this study,
this derivative was chemically modified to irreversibly bind MDM2 and TSPO. The
new compound elicited a TSPO-mediated mitochondrial membrane dissipation and
restored p53 activity, triggering a long-lasting apoptosis of GBM cells. These effects
were sustained over time, involved a stable activation of extracellular signal regulated
kinases and were specifically observed in cancer cells, in which these protein kinases
are deregulated. Dual-targeting and irreversible binding properties combined in the
same molecule may represent a useful strategy to overcome the time-limited effects
elicited by classical chemotherapies.

INTRODUCTION

consequently, different approaches have been tried to
overcome this phenomenon such as the use of multi-target
drugs and the trial of long-lasting active molecules [6].
Recent discoveries in molecular biology have shown
that the aberration of different signalling pathways are
involved in the pathogenesis of malignant gliomas and
have allowed the identification of new targets for novel
therapeutic approaches, including growth factor ligands,
receptors, and intracellular downstream effectors [7].
Because these deregulated intracellular signalling
pathways, including the PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of
the rapamycin (mTOR) and the Ras/extracellular signal-

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a WHO grade
IV malignant glioma [1], is the most common and lethal
primary brain tumour in adults [2], with a median survival
of less than 2 years. Presently, treatment of GBM is based
on cytoreductive resection combined with radiotherapy
and adjuvant chemotherapy with Temozolomide (TMZ)
[3]. Nonetheless, the prognosis of GBM patients remains
poor because of the onset of drug resistance and tumour
recurrence [4, 5]. A number of attempts have been made
to understand the molecular basis of resistance, and

a

regulated kinase (ERK), are a point of convergence for
different stimuli, the concept of one disease-one drug is
challenging, and multi-target therapy is becoming the
favourite way to develop innovative and more efficient
therapies [8-11].
Furthermore, it has been postulated that reversible
drugs may have several limitations in cancer therapy.
Indeed, a reversible molecule may not be enough to
sustain a therapeutic effect over time, thereby favouring
the activation of alternative signalling pathways that
escape drug action and cause resistance. For these
reasons, oncology research has recently been focused
on the synthesis and development of new irreversible
and long-lasting molecules [12]. Recently, different
irreversible inhibitors for tyrosine kinase receptors have
been described, and some of these are under clinical
development for the therapy of breast, lung and other
solid tumours [13-18]. Lately, pre-clinical results for an
irreversible, orally administered pan-ERBB inhibitor in
mice GBM xenograft tumours have been reported [19].
These data showed that the long-lasting activity of the drug
towards epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can
substantially increase the efficacy of the drug, suggesting
irreversible ligands as a new, valuable therapeutic option
to overcome drug resistance.
In GBM, p53 and Translocator protein (TSPO),
both acting as apoptosis inducers, represent two attractive
intracellular targets. Classic TSPO ligands, such as
PK11195, have demonstrated anticancer effects both in
vitro and in vivo; in addition, newly synthesized TSPO
ligands triggered apoptosis in human and rat GBM cells by
modulating the opening of the mitochondrial permeability
transition pore (MPTP), of which TSPO is an important
constitutive protein [20, 21].
On the other hand, deregulation of the p53 protein
is widely described in the literature, and reactivation of its
endogenous function represents an important anticancer
therapeutic strategy, at least for those tumours that do
not contain a mutant p53. P53 is negatively regulated by
the murine double minute 2 (MDM2), and inhibitors of
MDM2/p53 interaction currently represent another viable
approach in GBM therapy [22-24].
Recently, we have characterized TSPO/MDM2
dual-target ligands and demonstrated that these agents
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

present an attractive multi-modal anti-cancer activity in
GBM cells [25]. In this study, we started from this scaffold
and synthesized a new dual target compound with longlasting binding properties towards MDM2 and TSPO.
Specifically, this compound was characterized by the
presence of a chemo-reactive isothiocyanate group, able
to covalently bind the target proteins. The compound
activated mitochondrial membrane dissipation and
restored p53 activity, inducing GBM cell apoptosis. It is
noteworthy that the new molecule oriented the cellular fate
towards irreversible apoptosis via the stable activation of
the p53-MDM2-ERK axis. These results indicated that
the development of new molecules targeting more key
proteins and able to regulate intracellular signalling over
time may offer innovative and alternative strategies to
overcome the reversible activity of chemotherapy agents.

RESULTS
Synthesis of the new compound
The convergent procedure applied for the
synthesis of the target indole derivative EB148 is
outlined in Figure 1. The dipeptide 3 was obtained
in two steps starting from Boc-L-leucine 1, which
was condensed with L-phenylalanine ethyl ester in
the presence of N,N’-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) in
anhydrous dimethylformamide to obtain compound 2,
then deprotected by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid,
as previously described [25]. Acylation of the 5-nitro2-phenylindole 5 with oxalyl chloride in anhydrous
ethyl ether at 0°C yielded the corresponding 5–nitro-2phenylindolylglyoxylyl chloride 6 [26].
Reaction of derivative 6 with compound 3 in
the presence of triethylamine in anhydrous toluene at
0°C gave compound 7, which was purified by flash
chromatography. Then, the (5-nitro-2-phenylindol-3-yl)
glyoxyl-L-leucine-L-phenylalanine ethyl ester 7 was
catalytically hydrogenated over palladium to yield the
corresponding amine 8, which was then reacted with
thiophosgene in a biphasic CH2Cl2/aqueous NaHCO3
solution to give the desired isothiocyanato derivative

EB148, which was purified by flash chromatography. The
reversible analogue EB54 was synthesized essentially as
described previously [25]. Purity degree of the compounds
(> 96%) was assessed by HPLC.
The stability of EB148 in aqueous solution was
evaluated by HPLC analysis. The results showed no
significant degradation of the compound: indeed, the
average peak area of EB148 was 98.83 ± 0.47 % within
72 h.

EB54 and EB148 (Figure 2A) displaced specific [3H]
PK11195 binding in a concentration-dependent manner,
with Ki values of 108 ± 10 nM and 199 ± 18 nM (Figure
2B), respectively. The affinity of the reversible ligand
(EB54) towards human TSPO was consistent with data
obtained in rat kidney membranes [25].
Direct kinetic binding studies indicated that [3H]
PK11195 labelled TSPO with an association constant rate
(Kon) of 9.15 ± 0.85 x 106 M-1 min-1 (Figure 2C; Table
1). Dissociation occurred rapidly when the ligand-receptor
complex was exposed to a saturating concentration of
unlabelled PK11195 (Figure 2C). The dissociation rate
constant (Koff) was estimated to be 0.0264 ± 0.0018 min1
, leading to a calculated half-life of 26.1 ± 1.8 min-1.

EB148 exhibited long-lasting binding properties

At first, the ability of EB148 to bind human TSPO
was tested by radioligand binding studies in U87MG cells.

is the sustained inhibition of the target protein, with a
recovery of activity that occurs only after re-synthesis
of the target protein. To determine the binding kinetics
of EB54 and EB148, a competition kinetic method was
performed [27,28]. Figure 3 shows the effect of multiple
concentrations of unlabelled test compounds on the
association binding kinetics of [3H]PK11195. By fixing
the association and dissociation rate constants for [3H]
PK11195 to the values previously determined, it was
possible to obtain the relevant kinetic binding parameters
for each compound (Table 1).
The rank order of dissociation half-lives for the
tested compounds was EB148 > PK11195 ≥ EB54, thus
demonstrating that EB148 acts as a long-lasting TSPO
ligand. To verify the kinetic approach, the pKd values for
the tested ligands were calculated as a ratio of estimated
koff and kon values. The comparison between pKd
and competition pKi values (Table 1 and Figure 2B)
demonstrates that the two methods produce comparable
results, thus validating the indirect kinetic method.

Several pieces of evidence have shown that TSPO
is a constituent of the MPTP and therefore takes part in
the dissipation of membrane potential (Δψm) that occurs
after MPTP opening. To assess whether the compounds
could modulate MPT-pore opening through their selective
binding to TSPO, Δψm was measured in mitochondria
isolated from U87MG cells. The treatment of the isolated
mitochondria with EB54 or EB148 (1 µM) for 20 min led
to a significant reduction in tetrachloro-tetraethylbenzimid
azolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) accumulation compared
to control untreated mitochondria, demonstrating
the collapse of Δψm (Figure 4A, 4B and 4C). When
compound-treated mitochondria were centrifuged and
washed to remove the TSPO ligands, only EB148
determined Δψm collapse. These results demonstrate that
the long-lasting TSPO ligand can dissipate Δψm even after
mitochondria wash-out (Figure 4B and 4C).

half-life (t1/2) of 16.4 ± 2.1 (10 nM), 3.83 ± 0.65 (100 nM)
and 2.27 ± 0.93 (10 µM) min-1, respectively. No significant
differences in the association kinetics between EB54
and EB148, both tested at a 10 µM concentration, were
detected (EB54: t1/2=2.33 ± 0.83; Figure 5B).
To verify the EB148 covalent mechanism of
action, kinetic dissociation of the p53/MDM2 complex
was evaluated in cell lysates and in whole cells. Cell
lysates were treated for 60 min with EB148 or EB54

at a concentration ten-fold higher than their IC50 value.
Afterwards, the lysates were diluted 1:20 by adding
reaction buffer and incubated for different times (0-180
min), after which the extent of p53-MDM2 complex was
quantified. The activity of compound EB148 in inhibiting
p53-MDM2 complex was maintained unchanged after
sample dilution. In contrast, the reversible analogue
gradually decreased its activity through the dilution time
(Figure 6A and 6B). These data confirmed that EB148 acts
as a long-lasting inhibitor of the p53-MDM2 complex.

an antibody specific for p53 and subsequently an HRP-conjugated antibody and a TMB substrate kit. Blank wells were obtained in the

MDM2 antibody and levels of the MDM2/p53 complex were quantified as in A. Curves were generated using a sigmoidal dose-response
curve model (A) (GraphPad Prism 5 software) from which the IC50 values were derived, or an association kinetics model (B).

A limitation of the “in tube” assay is that it is an
isolated system that does not account for compound
permeability through the cell membrane as well as the
cellular machinery that may interfere with the biological
activity by regulating the expression/degradation of
protein target and of the compound itself. For this reason,
the activity of EB148 or EB54 as inhibitors of the p53MDM2 complex was also assessed in whole cells using
the same validated ELISA assay. U87MG cells were
incubated for 8 h with EB148 or EB54 and then the levels
of the p53-MDM2 complex were quantified. As expected,
both EB54 and EB148 inhibited the p53-MDM2 complex
after 8 h (Figure 7). When U87MG cells were washed out
to remove ligands, a significant difference in the recovery
of p53-MDM2 complex formation was observed. As
shown in Figure 7, in cells treated with EB54, the recovery
of p53-MDM2 complex occurred within 12 h. The longlasting compound EB148 significantly slowed down new
complex formation, which was maintained significantly
lower than in the control even after 24 h cell wash-out
(Figure 7).

out period of 16 h brought p53 accumulation to control
levels in EB54-treated cells. In contrast, even if the
transcription was not activated at this time point, EB148
also maintained high p53 levels after cell wash-out (Figure
9A and 9B).

EB148 induced a long-lasting activation of
intracellular ERK
The kinetic pattern of ERK activation is the prerequisite that regulates the final biological outcomes of
these kinases. A transient kinase activation is commonly
associated with a proliferative effect, whereas their
sustained phosphorylation over time triggers death
signalling pathways. In this regard, the kinetics of ERK
activation induced by EB148 and its reversible analogue,
EB54, were evaluated. The data depicted in Figure 10A
and 10B showed that reversible compound EB54 did not
induce any significant ERK1/2 stimulation. In contrast,
EB148 induced significant ERK phosphorylation, and
this signal remained switched-on up to 8 h after cell
treatment (Figure 10A). Moreover, after cell wash-out the
long lasting compound EB148 continued to significantly
activate the MAPKs (Figure 10A).
To unequivocally prove that ERK activation elicited
by EB148 was mediated by p53, experiments were
repeated in the presence of the p53 inhibitor pifithrin-β
(1 µM) [30].
As depicted in Figure 10B, blocking p53 completely
impaired EB148-mediated ERK1/2 activation but did
not significantly affect the EB54 response. These data
demonstrate that the sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation
elicited by the long-lasting MDM2 inhibitor involves a
p53-mediated mechanism.
It has been ascertained that a sustained activated
ERK directly interacts with MDM2 inhibiting its ubiquitin
ligase activity and triggering pro-apoptotic p53-mediated
pathways [31,32]. To evaluate the role of ERK in the
long-lasting effects evoked by EB148, the association
between ERKs and MDM2 in response to cell treatment
with EB148 was evaluated. EB148 induced a significant
and marked induction of complex formation (Figure 10C).
This association was evident after both 8 and 24 h after
cell treatment and remained significant after cell wash-out
for 24 h. These data suggest that the long-lasting inhibition
of MDM2 induced sustained ERK phosphorylation, and
this activated kinase might play a role in controlling
MDM2 activity and triggering p53-mediated apoptotic
effects. In contrast, cell incubation with EB54 did not
induce any significant MDM2-ERK association.

EB148 efficiently reactivated the p53 pathway
To support the reactivation of the p53 pathway,
mRNA expression levels of p53 target genes and p53
protein expression were evaluated. Significant differences
in the kinetics of induction of p53 target genes were
detected after cell incubation with the long-lasting MDM2
inhibitor EB148 or the reversible analogue EB54. Indeed,
after 8 and 16 h of U87MG cell treatment EB54 induced
a significant increase in the mRNA expression level of
p21, p53 and MDM2 (Figure 8A and 8B). The expression
of these genes gradually slowed down and, after 24 h,
reached values significantly lower than controls (Figure
8C), likely by means of a feed-back inhibition mechanism.
In contrast, EB148 induced a sustained increase in
the mRNA expression of p53 target genes up to 24 h of
cell treatment. Notably, high induction of MDM2 mRNA
was observed: EB148 caused a 6.9-, 8.8- and 2.2-fold
induction of MDM2 mRNA after 8, 16 and 24 h of cell
treatment, respectively, whereas the maximal increase
of the MDM2 transcript elicited by EB54 was 2.9-fold
versus control (Figure 8A, 8B and 8C). To evaluate
reversible versus long-lasting effects of EB54 and EB148,
cells were treated with each compound for 2 h and then
washed out for 16 h in a drug-free medium. After the cells
were challenged with EB54, the levels of the p53 target
genes were down-regulated (Figure 8D). When the longlasting compound EB148 was added in the pre-incubation
medium, the transcripts of p53 target genes returned to
control values (Figure 8D).
Consistent with the data obtained with Real time
PCR analysis (RT-PCR), challenging GBM cells with
EB54 and EB148 for 16 h led to a slight but significant
increase in p53 protein levels (Figure 9A and 9B); a washwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

EB148 inhibited GBM cell proliferation over time
and triggered apoptosis

out. After EB148 cell treatment and subsequent removal,
the inhibition of cell proliferation was maintained, thus
suggesting the inability of the cells to restart proliferation.
In contrast, a significant recovery in proliferative activity
was detected when cells were pre-treated with the
reversible compound EB54 (Figure 11C). These results
suggest that the drug-target residence time plays a crucial
role in the control of cell proliferation over-time.
To determine toxicity in non-tumour cells, the
effects of EB148 and EB54 were examined on normal
mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) isolated from human
bone marrow. Of note, the MSC viability of non-cancer
cells was significantly decreased after 72 h of incubation
with EB54 at 10 µM (Suppl. Figure 1). However,
the percentages of cell proliferation reduction were
significantly lower than those observed in U87MG cells,

The effects of the compounds on cell viability
and proliferation were then examined. Cell treatment
with EB54 or EB148 for 72 h induced a concentrationdependent reduction in cell proliferation, yielding IC50
values of 177 ± 15 nM and 91.6 ± 8.9 nM, respectively
(Figure 11A). Moreover, both compounds reduced the
total number of living cells, showing a maximal effect at
100 µM concentration (Figure 11B).
To assess whether U87MG cells could resume
growing after inhibitor removal, culture medium was
replaced with fresh medium not containing drugs and
cell proliferation was monitored 72 h after cell wash-

suggesting that the anti-proliferative effect elicited by the
reversible dual ligand EB54 was directed preferentially
towards tumour cells. In contrast, EB148 did not affect
MSC proliferation even at the highest concentration tested,
suggesting a lack of cell toxicity.
Then, the effect of EB148 on the regulation of cell
cycle and on the apoptotic process was investigated. P53
activation in proliferating cells often caused cell cycle
arrest at the G1 or G2 phases, an event that commonly
involves the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21.
According to these outcomes, a cell cycle cytofluorimetric
assay revealed that both compounds similarly induced a
significant increase in G0/G1 phase, suggesting a block of
the cell cycle (Figure 12A and 12B).
In addition, the treatment of U87MG cells with
EB148, as well as with the reversible EB54, induced

a significant phoshpatidilserine externalization in the
absence and in the presence of 7-amino-actinomysin
binding to DNA, thus demonstrating that both compounds
induced early and late apoptosis of the cells (Figure 12C
and 12D).

DISCUSSION
Compound EB148, designed as a dual molecule
targeting both MDM2 and TSPO proteins, was
demonstrated in this study to activate the ERK intracellular
signalling pathway over time, driving GBM cells towards
an unavoidable fate of death. These effects were also
maintained after ligand depletion, thus suggesting that
increasing the drug-residence time to its targets may

represent a proper way to improve GBM treatment
outcome.
GBM treatment is an undisputed neurosurgical
challenge. The major limitations of the current antiproliferative therapies for GBM are related to the onset
of drug resistance phenomena [5]. Results from both
basic and clinical research have suggested that the
development of irreversible agents [12, 19] and multitarget compounds [9] may lead to the discovery of novel
therapeutic strategies for GBM and other types of solid
tumours. In terms of current multi-therapy strategies,
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are emerging in GBM.
Several inhibitors targeting these two kinases have been
developed; for example, XL765 has been demonstrated to
reduce cell viability in vitro and is possibly effective when
combined with TMZ therapy [33]. Recently, we identified
new reversible compounds dual-targeting MDM2 and
TSPO, two proteins that are both up-regulated in GBM
so contributing to cancer cell resistance to physiological
apoptosis [25]. These compounds have showed high and
prolonged anti-proliferative activity in GBM cells, with
significantly higher effects than those elicited by the
single target reference standards, thus confirming that
dual inhibitors might have improved results compared to
monotherapy.
Furthermore, it is also true that targeting one or
more signalling pathways with reversible molecules may
be not enough to sustain the therapeutic effects over time,
and actually may favour the activation of alternative
signalling pathways and the onset of drug resistance
phenomena. Recently, there has been a resurgence of
interest towards irreversible inhibitors, and this topic has
been excellently reviewed in several publications from a
risk-benefit perspective [34, 35] and in terms of the current
irreversible inhibitors that are in preclinical or clinical
development [36]. Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors
with irreversible activity have been developed, and some
of these are now in phase I-III trials for the treatment of
different solid tumours, [37-40] including GBM. The
irreversible inhibitors include Canertinib (CI1033; Pfizer/
Warner-Lambert), Pelitinib (EKB-569; Wyest-Ayerst) and
Dacomitinib [41].
Based on this evidence, we wondered whether
a molecule that modulated two distinct intracellular
targets (namely MDM2 and TSPO) with a long-lasting
mechanism of action, might have greater and longer life
span of anti-proliferative activity in GBM cells.
In the design of the new irreversible dual target
compound, the basic structure of the recently developed
2-phenylindol-3ylglyoxyldipeptide derivative EB54, [25]
was examined to determine the best synthetically feasible
position for the introduction of a moiety conferring
long-lasting properties. The 5-position of the indole ring
seemed suitable for a chemo-reactive group. Among
possible chemo-reactive moieties, isothiocyanate has
proven extremely versatile as an electrophilic moiety for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

long-lasting ligands. It can easily be synthesized from a
primary amino group; furthermore, its high reactivity
towards amino and sulfhydryl groups, along with its low
reactivity towards water and other hydroxyl functions,
accounts for its successful applications in receptor studies
[26, 42]. Actually, we recently employed this moiety to
develop selective irreversible TSPO ligands as useful
tools to study the role of this protein in human GBM cells
[26, 43]. Thus, the derivative EB148 was synthesized and
biologically evaluated.
Compound EB148 was able to cause GBM cell
death by arresting the cell cycle and inducing an apoptotic
pathway of cell death. The effects elicited by EB148
appeared to be greater and more long-lasting than those of
the reversible analogue. Furthermore, the apoptotic effects
appeared to be irreversible so that the cells were not able
to regain proliferative activity after drug wash-out.
The biological characterization of EB148 started
with the evaluation of its ability to bind TSPO and to
induce ∆ψm collapse in mitochondria isolated from
GBM cells. The compound displayed a nanomolar range
affinity for TSPO, with a long-lasting binding profile,
as demonstrated by kinetic competition experiments.
Through TSPO activation, EB148 induced permeability
transition pore opening in GBM cells without any
steroidogenic activity and, differently to that which
occurred with the reversible analogue EB54, this effect
was maintained over time, even after cell wash-out.
Therefore, we can conclude that the long-time activation
of TSPO caused an irreversible mitochondrial collapse.
Then, the ability of the same compound to dissociate
the MDM2-p53 complex was investigated by an in
vitro ELISA-based assay [25]. To evaluate the covalent
mechanism of action, kinetic dissociation studies of p53MDM2 complex inhibition were performed both in cell
lysates and in whole cells. EB148 inhibited MDM2-p53
association with a nanomolar potency, a value comparable
to that detected with the reversible analogue EB54. As
a major difference, the long-lasting compound EB148
induced prolonged inhibition of the MDM2-p53 complex
that was maintained even after cell wash-out, thus
demonstrating its covalent binding to MDM2 protein. The
sustained inhibition of MDM2-p53 complex formation
may account for the different kinetic pattern in the
regulation of p53 gene targets induced by the reversible
versus the long-lasting compound and may explain the
differences in the long-term pro-apoptotic effects elicited
by EB148. To dissect the molecular mechanism involved
in the long-term effects of EB148, the modulation of ERKs
was investigated. The GBM biological characteristics
are exemplified by prominent proliferation, active
invasiveness and rich angiogenesis. These features are
mainly due to highly deregulated signalling pathways in
the tumour, in particular the Ras/MEK/MAPK pathways
[44].
MAPK signalling plays a crucial role in almost all

cell functions and therefore requires exquisite control of its
spatiotemporal activity [45]. Depending on the duration,
the magnitude and its subcellular localization, ERK
activation controls various and opposite cell responses,
such as proliferation, migration, differentiation and death.
An interesting question is how such an apparently
straightforward and simple cascade can generate a wide
array of biological responses depending on the cellular
context. One way to achieve diversity in signalling
outcomes is to control the signal duration by acting on
the dose and on the drug-target residence time. Indeed,
limiting exposure to ligands could be another mechanism
to control signalling duration and switch-like cellular
responses [46, 47].
The proliferative effects of ERKs in response to
mitogenic signals are commonly associated with a transient
activation of these kinases. In contrast, a sustained ERK
activation induces a progressive accumulation of deathpromoting factors, up to a level that induces cell death.
Prolonged ERK activation has been shown to promote
death of human cancer cell lines of different origins
and to be the primary mechanism of action of different
chemotherapy agents [48-53]. Understanding the critical
pathological roles of this signalling molecule and its
regulatory mechanisms in the progression of glioma is
important for the development of effective moleculartargeted therapies against GBM. Furthermore, the
development of ERK signalling modulators may likely
represent a smart strategy to selectively target cancer cells
with deregulated ERK activity but not normal cells in
which ERK activation is transient.
In several tumour cell lines, a strict interplay
between ERK signalling and the MDM2-p53 pathway has
been demonstrated. ERK, via a phophorylation process,
promotes p53 stability and activity and inhibits p53
interaction with MDM2. On the other hand, p53 may act
as an upstream regulator of ERK activation for the drugmediated induction of apoptosis in different tumour cells
[46, 48, 51]. Notwithstanding that the role of the p53MDM2 axis in the progression of GBM has been well
explained, the interplay between p53-MDM2 and the ERK
pathway has not yet been deeply investigated.
In this study, EB148 was demonstrated to induce
a sustained and p53-dependent stimulation of ERK1/2
phosphorylation, whereas no significant activation was
detected after treatment of cells with the reversible
analogue, EB54. Because of prolonged ERK activation,
EB148 favoured the association of MDM2 with ERK.
Because it has been demonstrated that ERK mediated
MDM2 phosphorylation reduced the ubiquitin ligase
activity of MDM2 and in turn potentiated p53 proapoptotic effects, we can speculate that EB148, favouring
MDM2-ERK association, contributed to sustain p53
activation over time. In this scenario, the long-lasting
inhibition of MDM2 may activate a feed-back mechanism
through which the p53-MDM2-ERK axis feeds itself in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the control of cell fate triggering an irreversible path of
cell death.
Overall, our data demonstrated that in GBM cells 1)
EB148 acts as a dual and irreversible-like ligand targeting
both MDM2 and TSPO proteins, 2) the long-lasting
activation of the two targets induced irreversible apoptosis,
and 3) the ERK pathway is likely one of the molecular
mechanism involved in the p53-mediated effects.

Stability test
To test the stability of EB148 in aqueous solution,
the compound was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with
PBS to the final 1 µM concentration (the amount of
DMSO in the final solution was 1%). The solution was
maintained in a closed vial and analysed by HPLC at
specific times (4, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h) using the following
conditions: column Shim-pack VP-ODS 4.6 µm (250 mm
x 4.6 mm), isocratic elution with water, flow rate of 1 ml/
min, room temperature. The percentage of decomposition
was calculated on the base of peak area of the product.

Cell cultures
U87MG cells were cultured in RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM-glutamine, 100 U/
ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 1% nonessential amino acids at 37°C in 5% CO2. U87MG cells
were plated at 5x103 cells/cm2. After 24 h, culture medium
was replaced with fresh medium containing newly
synthesized compounds solubilized in DMSO for the
indicated incubation times. DMSO was added to control
cells (0.5 % v/v). Human MSCs were cultured in normal
growth medium (MSCGM, Lonza), plated (5x103 cells/
cm2) in 75-cm2 flasks and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2
and 95% air. The medium was changed to remove non
adherent cells every 3 to 4 days, and the cells were used
at passages 0 to 3.

TSPO binding assays
Equilibrium radioligand binding assays were
performed essentially as previously described [54].
Briefly, aliquots of U87MG cell membranes (20 µg of
proteins) were incubated with [3H]PK 11195 (1.5 nM)
in the presence (non-specific binding) or in the absence
(total binding) of unlabelled PK 11195 (1 µM), in the
final volume of 500 µl of assay buffer for 120 min at
0°C. Samples were rapidly filtered under vacuum through
GF/C glass fiber filters. Radioactivity was measured by
liquid scintillation counter (TopCount; PerkinElmer Life
and Analytical Sciences; 65 % counting efficiency).
In U87MG cell membranes, [3H]PK11195 maximum
number of binding sites (Bmax) and affinity (Kd) were
determined in previous experiments by Scatchard analysis
of saturation binding data [43].

TSPO association and dissociation kinetics

Dissociation studies of native MDM2/p53 complex

Association kinetics for [3H]PK11195 were
determined incubating U87MG cell membranes (20 μg
protein) with 1.5 nM radioligand at various time points
up to a total of 3 h. Dissociation kinetics were determined
by pre-equilibrating membranes and [3H]PK11195 for
120 min and the adding a saturating concentration of cold
PK11195 (1 μM).
Association and dissociation rate constants for [3H]
PK11195 binding were determined by global analysis of
the association and dissociation binding curves according
to mono-exponential association and decay curves.
From this analysis an estimate of the dissociation (koff)
and observed association (kobs) rates for ligand binding
was generated; the association rate constant (kon) was
determined according to the following relationship kobs
= [A] kon + koff; ligand-receptor half-life was calculated
as 0.693/koff.
For competition kinetics, the [3H] PK11195 curves
in the presence and absence of EB54 or EB148, were fitted
using the equations in Dowling and Charlton [55].

To test the ability of new compound to dissociate
the native MDM2/p53 complex, a quantitative sandwich
immune-enzymatic assay, on crude cell lysates obtained
from U87MG cells was applied [25,29]. Cells were
washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline,
collected by centrifugation, and suspended in lysis buffer
(20 mM Tris HCl, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1%
NONIDET40, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8) containing 1% of the
Protease inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma Aldrich, Milan, Italy).
96-wells were pre-coated with a mouse full-length antiMDM2 antibody (sc-965, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
1:50 in 0.05% Poly-L-Ornithine) overnight at room
temperature. Cell lysates (20 µg in a final volume of 100
µl) were pre-incubated with DMSO (control), or different
compound concentration for 10 min at room temperature,
and then transferred to the pre-coated wells for 60 min.
After three quick washes with PBS/Tween 0.05% to
remove unbound MDM2, each well was incubated for 15
min with 1% BSA, to block nonspecific sites, and then for
1.5 h at room temperature with a rabbit primary anti-p53
antibody (sc-6243, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:250).
Then, wells were washed and incubated for 1 h with an
anti-rabbit HRP-conjugate antibody, and washed again.
The TMB substrate kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) allowed
a colorimetric quantification of the MDM2/p53 complex.
Blanks were obtained processing cell lysates in the
absence of the primary anti-p53 antibody. Absorbance’s
values at 450 nm were measured, background subtracted
and sigmoid dose-response curves were generated using
Graph Pad Prism 4 software, from which IC50 values of
MDM2/p53 complex were derived.

5,59,6,69-tetrachloro1,19,3,39tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) [25].
Mitochondria were isolated from U87MG cells using the
Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Sigma Aldrich, Milan, Italy)
following manufacturer’s instructions.
Isolated mitochondria were treated for 20 min
with EB54 or EB148 (1 µM). In wash-out experiments,
mitochondria were then centrifuged at 11.000 x g for 5
min, washed with fresh saline and suspended in JC-1
buffer not containing the drugs. At the end of treatments,
5 µg of control and treated mitochondria were added to
the JC-1 dye. The fluorescence (relative fluorescence
units, RFU) of the sample was read in a spectrofluorimeter
using a time-drive method (one acquisition each 10 sec,
for 10 min), where the excitation wavelength was set to
490 nm and emission wavelength at 590 nm. JC-1 exhibits
potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria,
where higher concentrations start to form J-aggregates
indicated by a fluorescence emission shift from green
(529 nm, monomer emission maximum) to orange-red
(590 nm, aggregate emission maximum). Consequently,
mitochondrial depolarization is indicated by a decrease in
the orange-red fluorescence intensity.

To investigate the association kinetics of the

different times (0-120 min) with EB148 or EB54.
Following incubation, cell lysates were captured on wells
pre-coated with MDM2 antibody for an additional 60 min.
After extensive washes, levels of the MDM2/p53 complex
were quantified as described above.
In dissociation studies, U87MG cell lysates,
suspended in lysis buffer, were incubated for 90 min with
EB148 or EB54 in order to reach association plateau.
Dissociation was initiated by the addition of 20 volumes
of cold buffer, and lysates were further incubated at 4°C
for the indicated times (0-180 min). Following incubation,
200 µl of the mixture were captured on wells pre-coated
with MDM2 antibody for an additional 60 min. After
extensive washes, levels of the MDM2/p53 complex were
quantified as described above.

Quantitation of p53/MDM2 and ERK/MDM2
complexes in U87MG cells

1:500). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) was the loading control (G9545, Sigma
Aldrich, Milan, Italy, 1:5000). The primary antibodies
were detected using the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies, which were then detected using
a chemioluminescent substrate (ECL, Perkin Elmer).
Densitometric analysis of the immunoreactive bands was
performed using Image J Software.

U87MG cells were treated with DMSO (control),
EB148 or EB54 for different times. When indicated, after
8 h of incubation, cells were washed twice with fresh
saline and cultured in drug-free medium for an additional
24 h. At the end of the treatment period, the cells were
collected, and suspended in lysis buffer containing 1%
of the Protease inhibitor Cocktail. Levels of p53/MDM2
or ERK/MDM2 complexes were quantified using the
ELISA test method described above in wells pre-coated
with an anti-MDM2 antibody. Cell lysates (20 µg in a
final volume of 100 µl) were transferred to the pre-coated
wells for 60 min; each well was then incubated for 1.5 h
at room temperature with p53 or ERK (sc-7383 SantaCruz
Biotechnology, 1:500) primary antibodies.

Cell viability and proliferation assay
The effects of compound treatment on U87MG cell
viability and proliferation were evaluated by Trypan blue
exclusion assays and MTS assay, respectively. U87MG
cells were treated with EB148 or EB54 for 72 h. Following
treatment, harvested cells were mixed with an equal
volume of 0.4% trypan blue dye. For quantization of cell
viability, blue and bright cells were counted, and viability
was calculated as the number of living (bright) and dead
(blue) cells in each well. To establish the effect of MDM2
inhibitors on cell proliferation, cells were treated for 72 h
with different concentrations of each compound (0.1 nM–
100 µM) for 72 h, and then MTS assay was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The absorbance of formazan at 490 nm was
measured in a colorimetric assay with an automated plate
reader (Victor Wallac 2, Perkin Elmer). For wash-out
experiments, U87MG cells were treated with EB148 or
EB54 (100 nM-10 µM) for 72 h. Following incubation,
medium-containing drugs was replaced by fresh medium,
and cells were allowed to growth for the indicated days.
At the end of treatments, cell proliferation was measured
by MTS assay. The results were calculated by subtracting
the mean background from the values obtained from each
evaluation and were expressed as the percentage of the
control (untreated cells). Sigmoid dose-response curve
was generated, from which the IC50 values were derived.
To evaluate compound toxicity, MSCs were treated
for 72 h with different concentrations of EB148 or EB54.
At the end of treatments, cell proliferation was measured
by MTS assay.

Relative mRNA quantification of p53 target genes
The assessment of the levels of p53 mRNA gene
targets was evaluated by real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR). In brief,
total RNA was extracted from control cells as well
as from cells treated with EB148 or EB54 (1 µM) for
different times (8 h, 16 h or 24 h), using RneasyH Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed with 500 ng
of RNA using using i-Script cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad,
Hercules, USA). RT-PCR reactions consisted of 25 µl
FluocycleH II SYBRH (Euroclone, Milano, Italy), 1.5 µl
of both 10 µM forward and reverse primers (listed in [56]),
3 µl cDNA, and 19 µL of H2O. For each sample, mRNA
levels of p53 gene target were normalized against β-actin
mRNA levels, and relative expression was calculated by
using Ct value. PCR specificity was verified by both the
melting curve analysis and gel electrophoresis.

Western blotting analysis
U87MG were treated with DMSO (control),
EB148 or EB54 for 16 h. When indicated, after 16 h of
incubation, cells were washed twice with fresh saline,
and incubated with fresh medium not containing the
drugs for an additional 24 h. At the end of the treatment
period, the cells were collected and then lysed for 60 min
at 4 °C using 200 μl of RIPA buffer (9.1 mM NaH2PO4,
1.7 mM Na2HPO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and a
protease-inhibitor cocktail). Equal amounts of the cell
extracts (40 µg of protein) were diluted in Laemmli sample
solution, resolved using SDS-PAGE (8.5%), transferred to
PVDF membranes and probed overnight at 4 °C using an
anti-p53 antibody (FL-393, Santa Cruz Biotechnology;
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cell cycle analysis
The measurement of the percentage of cells in
the different phases of cell cycle was performed using
the MuseTM Cell Analyzer (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt,
Germany). Briefly, U87MG cells were treated for 24
h with DMSO, reversible or irreversible compound (1
µM). Adherent cells were collected and suspended in the
fluorescent reagent (MuseTM Cell Cycle reagent). After
incubation for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, the
measurements of the percentage of cells in the different
phases was acquired [25].
