BACKGROUND: Clofarabine is a nucleoside analog with activity in myeloid malignancies. Experience in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is limited. METHODS: The goal of this study was to evaluate the activity and safety of 2 different
doses (15 mg/m2 vs 30 mg/m2 daily  5 days) of intravenous clofarabine in patients with higher-risk MDS. Fifty-eight
patients with a median age of 68 years (range, 25-89) including 15 patients (28%) with secondary MDS and 35
patients (60%) who received prior DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors were adaptively randomized between
the 2 dose cohorts. RESULTS: The overall response rate (ORR; based on a modification of International Working
Group criteria) was 36% including 26% with complete remission (CR) (ORR, 41% at 15 mg/m2 and 29% at 30 mg/m2).
Responses were lower in patients who failed DNMT inhibitors (ORR, 17%; CR rate, 14%). The 8-week mortality rate was
19%. Median survival was 7.4 months for all patients, 13.4 months for responders, and 21.7 months for complete responders. Some adverse events, particularly hepatic and renal, were more severe (grade >2) in patients randomized
to 30 mg/m2 of clofarabine. Myelosuppression and infectious complications were frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Both the
lower and higher doses of clofarabine have comparable clinical activity, but the lower dose appeared less toxic. If
these results are confirmed, lower doses of clofarabine, possibly in alternative schedules, should be pursued. Cancer

INTRODUCTION

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder, charac-

terized by dysplastic changes in myeloid, erythroid, or megakaryocytic progenitors and cytopenias in 1 or more cell lines.1
The International Prognostic Scoring System provides a score to assess survival and risk of evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) based on percentage marrow blasts, karyotype, and severity of cytopenias.2,3 The risk of progression to
AML varies between 10% and 70%, and the median survival times range from 3.5-5.7 years to 0.4-1.2 years for lower-risk
and higher-risk patients, respectively.
Given the considerable clinical heterogeneity, therapeutic decisions remain challenging for patients with MDS.
Several drugs for MDS therapy have become available, such as lenalidomide for patients with transfusion-dependent 5
q lower-risk MDS and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors (hypomethylating agents) for patients with a
broader range of MDS. Complete remission (CR) rates remain low; responses are transient and mostly do not significantly
outlast treatment duration.4-6 After patients lose their response to DNMT inhibitors, no therapeutic alternatives currently
exist. Hence there is an ongoing need to expand the armamentarium of therapeutic options for patients with MDS.

IV Clofarabine in Higher-Risk MDS/Faderl et al

Clofarabine is a newer generation nucleoside analog,
which is similar in its molecular structure to fludarabine
and cladribine, but has distinct features that expand its
spectrum of activity.7 Besides its capacity to effectively inhibit DNA synthesis, it also causes disruption of mitochondrial membrane integrity with resultant release of
proapoptotic proteins, and is an effective inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase. The latter leads to intracellular
depletion of natural nucleosides and thus enhanced uptake
of the analog during DNA synthesis (self-potentiation).
Furthermore, clofarabine has a higher affinity to deoxycytidine kinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in intracellular
nucleoside phosphorylation, and a longer retention time
of the triphosphate metabolite than do its predecessors.
Although there is more experience with clofarabine
in adults with AML, earlier studies have also suggested
clinical activity in MDS.8-10 By using an oral formulation
of clofarabine at doses between 20 mg/m2 and 40 mg/m2
(with a bioavailability of around 55%) daily for 5 days, we
reported an overall response rate (ORR) of 43% (25%
CR rate), including a 30% response rate (10% CR)
among patients who failed DNMT inhibitor therapy.11
A commonly used dose of clofarabine in AML is 30
to 40 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) daily  5 days. We
hypothesized that in MDS lower-dose schedules may still
be as effective and less toxic. The current study tests the
hypothesis by comparing lower (15 mg/m2/d  5) doses
of clofarabine to standard dose (30 mg/m2/d  5) clofarabine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group
Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MDS based on
World Health Organization (WHO) or French-American-British (FAB) Group criteria with marrow blasts
5% or International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-risk or high-risk status were eligible (Table 1).12
All patients provided written informed consent according
to institutional guidelines. Prior biologic or targeted
therapies (eg, hypomethylating agents), or single-agent
chemotherapy, with the exception of cytarabine at doses
1 g/m2, were permitted. Patients receiving prior intensive multiagent chemotherapy were excluded. Hematopoietic growth factor support was allowed before therapy
with clofarabine. Patients were required to have Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2,
and adequate hepatorenal function (serum creatinine <2
mg/dL; total bilirubin <2 mg/dL; alanine aminotransferase [ALT] <3  upper limit of normal). Patients were
excluded for active and uncontrolled infections and other

Treatment and Monitoring
Patients were adaptively randomized to 1 of 2 dose schedules: 15 mg/m2 versus 30 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour daily for
5 consecutive days. Courses were repeated every 4 to 8
weeks depending on resolution of toxicities and marrow
recovery. In case of persistent disease, subsequent courses
were started regardless of counts. In case of CR, continuation of therapy required recovery of neutrophil counts to
0.75  109/L and platelet counts to 50  109/L. Any
drug-related nonhematologic toxicities needed to have
recovered to grade 1 before institution of the next course.
Therapy was permitted for a maximum of 12 courses,
unless patients had no response after 3 courses, progressed, or relapsed on therapy. Patients with stable disease
could remain on therapy if it was thought to be in their
best interest. Dose reductions (from 15 mg/m2 daily  5
to 10, 7.5, or 5 mg/m2 daily  5, and from 30 mg/m2 to
20, 15, and 10 mg/m2, respectively) were implemented for
prolonged marrow aplasia (marrow cellularity 5% without evidence of disease by day 42), major infections, and
any drug-related grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities. No
escalation of clofarabine doses was allowed. Supportive
care measures such as antibiotic prophylaxis (eg, levofloxacin, valacyclovir, and itraconazole or voriconazole), hematopoietic growth factors, and transfusions were provided as
necessitated for optimal medical care of the patients. Antifungals were withheld on days when clofarabine was given
to avoid exacerbation of liver function abnormalities. Inpatient administration of therapy was optional.
Patients were monitored with complete blood
count/platelet count at least weekly during course 1 and at
various frequencies as mandated thereafter. Creatinine,
bilirubin, and ALT were monitored weekly during course
1 followed by once every 2 to 4 weeks while on therapy.
Marrow aspiration (including cytogenetics if abnormal at
study start) to document remission was required every 1
to 3 courses.
Response Criteria
CR was defined as normalization of blood counts with
neutrophils 1  109/L and platelet counts 100  109/
L, and marrow blasts 5%. Hematologic improvement
was defined as CR with the exception of a lack of platelet
recovery to 100  109/L.13
Statistical Design
The primary endpoint of the study is assessment of efficacy of 2 different dose schedules of IV clofarabine as
defined by response rate. Secondary endpoints include

724

comparisons of response duration, survival, and toxicity
of the patients in each of the 2 dose levels. Patients were
randomized to receive either 15 mg/m2 or 30 mg/m2
using an adaptive procedure that based assignment probabilities on observed results in preceding patients according
to the method by Berry.14 For the first 30 patients, the
randomization was balanced with probability of 1=2 to
each of the 2 arms. Beginning with patient 31, and for
each subsequent patient, data from all patients with evaluable response versus no response were incorporated using
a Web-based data entry screen as provided by the Department of Biostatistics at The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center. Assignment to a treatment was
stopped if the probability that patients were assigned to
this arm was 5% or if there was an indication that a
response rate of 20% was not achieved. A treatment
would only be selected as superior if there was sufficient
evidence of superiority, whereas otherwise the trial would
accrue up to a total of 60 patients and would be regarded
as inconclusive. Continuous variables are summarized
using the mean or median (range). The distribution of
time-to-event endpoints (response duration, survival)
were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Response duration was calculated from response date to
last follow-up. Survival was calculated from start of treatment date until death or last follow-up.

RESULTS
Characteristics of the Study Group
The characteristics of the patients are listed in Table 1.
Greater than 80% of the patients were older than 60 years.
Approximately 1=4 of the patients had secondary MDS as
defined by a preceding malignancy that was treated with
chemotherapy, radiation, or both. About 2=3 of the
patients received some form of prior therapy for the MDS
diagnosis, mostly in the form of azacitidine (29%) decitabine (43%), or both (12%). On the basis of the WHO
classification, 58% of the patients had a diagnosis of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB)-1 or RAEB-2,
and the majority of the patients (78%) had intermediate2 and high-risk MDS by the International Prognostic
Scoring System. Fourteen patients (24%) had blasts
between 20% and 29% and therefore carried a diagnosis
of AML by WHO and RAEB in transformation (RAEBt) by FAB. Seventeen patients (29%) and 22 patients
(38%) had intermediate and poor karyotypes, respectively. Assignment to cytogenetic groups was based on the
International Prognostic Scoring System.2 There were no

statistically significant differences in any of these characteristics between the 2 treatment groups.
Response
All 58 patients have been evaluated for response. CR was
achieved in 15 patients (26%) and hematologic improvement in 6 (10%) for an ORR of 36% (Table 2).
Responses were similar in both dose cohorts (15 mg/m2 vs
30 mg/m2), with no differences in rates of CR and possibly a trend for a better overall response in the group of
patients who were treated with clofarabine 15 mg/m2.
Nine patients had a diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia (CMML), and 3 (2 CR, 1 hematologic improvement) responded; the 2 CRs occurred at the 30-mg/m2
dose level. Among the 14 patients with a diagnosis of
AML (RAEB-t by FAB criteria), 6 patients responded (4
CR and 2 hematologic improvement). In these, all the
responses occurred at doses of 15 mg/m2 and none at 30
mg/m2. The patient numbers in these subgroups are too
small to allow for definite conclusions except for the findings that 1) patients with the diagnosis of CMML and
AML (with blasts between 20% and 29%) had similar
responses as the whole group; and 2) treatment at lower
doses was as effective as at higher doses.
Fifteen patients had secondary MDS defined as a
prior history of malignancy that had been treated with either chemotherapy, radiation or both. Five patients who
had a prior malignancy but did not receive therapy or surgery only were not counted. Their ORR of 40% was comparable to that of the whole group, although all responses
occurred at 15 mg/m2 and none at 30 mg/m2.
A particularly relevant subgroup is patients who
have been exposed to prior therapy with DNMT inhibitors and either achieved no response to them or relapsed
on them. Six of these 35 patients (17%) responded.
Responses were equally divided between the 2 dose
cohorts.

February 1, 2012

In a multivariate analysis of factors including cytogenetics, prior exposure to DNMT inhibitors, and dose (15
mg/m2 vs 30 mg/m2), prior treatment with DNMT
inhibitors resulted in an independently significantly
higher nonresponse rate (odds ratio [OR], 8.57;
P ¼ .0001). This was further confirmed by step forward
multivariate analysis on all the baseline characteristics.
Survival, Response Duration, Mortality
Median duration of response was 8.8 months (range, 146þ months), and median survival 7.4 months (range, 048.2þ months), with no significant differences between
the 2 groups with respect to either parameter (Figs. 1 and
2). Among responders, the median survival was 13.4
months (range, 2.3-48.2þ months) and 21.7 months
(range, 3.9-48.2þ months) for those who have achieved a
CR. The median number of cycles to response was 1
(range, 1-3). The 1-year survival probabilities were 37%
overall (37% for patients treated at 15 mg/m2; 38% for
patients treated at 30 mg/m2), and the 1-year progressionfree survival was 39% (50%; 25%). None of the differences reached statistical significance. Mortality rates at 4 and
12 weeks are summarized in Table 3. Overall, 14 patients
(24%) died within the first 12 weeks of therapy, with a
trend for lower mortality rates at 15 mg/m2 (7 patients
[19%]) compared with 30 mg/m2 (7 patients [33%]).
Deaths were usually related to myelosuppression-associated infectious complications.
Treatment Administration and Consolidation
Therapy
Given the known myelosuppressive nature of clofarabine
and according to departmental treatment practice, 78%
of the patients were treated in an inpatient facility, with a
third of these patients staying for up to a month in a laminar air flow room (protective environment). The remainder of the patients received therapy in the outpatient

setting. The decision regarding admitting patients to a
laminar air flow room was mainly based on age 50 years
(as has been the practice at The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center for many years with regard to
AML/MDS induction therapy). About half of the patients
received hematopoietic growth factor support (mainly filgrastim) while on therapy with clofarabine. Almost all
patients (83%) received concomitant therapy with prophylactic antibiotics (antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral). Seventeen patients (29%) received consolidation
therapy, which consisted of a median of 2 cycles (range, 112). Noncontinuation was mainly because of lack of
response in combination with toxicities. Fifteen of these
patients were in the 15-mg/m2 group. Dose reductions
during consolidation became necessary in 10 patients
(59%), mostly because of myelosuppression and infectious complications during the preceding cycles of
therapy.

Toxicities
Toxicities during the first course of therapy are summarized in Table 4. Almost all patients (n ¼ 95) experienced
grade 2 toxicities; this was equal on each treatment arm.
They mostly consisted of gastrointestinal adverse events,
skin eruptions, and elevations of transaminases and/or bilirubin. Grade >2 toxicities were less frequent. However,
there were more patients (52%) with grade 3 elevations of
transaminases, bilirubinemia, and creatinine as well as
acute renal failure, skin rashes, diarrhea, and mucositis
with clofarabine at 30 mg/m2 compared with the 15-mg/
m2 dose group (22%). The 30-mg/m2 dose independently
predicted for significantly higher rate of any toxicity
(grade >2) by step forward multivariate analysis after considering covariates including creatinine, bilirubin, performance status, and prior exposure to DNMT inhibitors
(OR, 3.99; P ¼ .02). Nine patients (16%) developed elevations of the levels of creatinine, and another 4 patients
(7%; 1 receiving the 15 mg/m2 schedule and 3 the 30 mg/
m2 schedule) developed acute renal failure. Although in
each of them the surrounding circumstances included
infections, sepsis, and the use of nephrotoxic agents (vancomycin, aminoglycosides, amphotericin, furosemide), the
outcome of these patients was poor. About 50% of the patients
developed at least 1 infectious episode while on therapy.

DISCUSSION
Therapy of patients with MDS has improved substantially
over the past few years with the availability of lenalidomide for lower-risk, transfusion-dependent patients and
5q abnormality, and DNMT inhibitors for most of the
remainder. Despite progress, trying to match the biological heterogeneity of MDS with effective therapies still
leaves room for improvement. The prognosis remains
poor for patients with higher-risk disease and especially
those who have failed to respond or have relapsed on
DNMT inhibitor therapy. In a study by Jabbour et al, the
median survival for these patients was 4.3 months, and
the estimated 12-month survival rate was 28%.15

treatment of adults with AML.16-18 As earlier studies indicated activity in patients with MDS, several clinical studies have focused specifically on these patients.9 Given the
availability of an oral formulation of clofarabine (bioavailability of 55%), we reported our experience using 3 different doses (ranging from 20 to 40 mg/m2 daily for 5 days)
in a similar population of patients with MDS as in the
current study.11 The response rate was 43% for all
patients and 30% for those failing prior therapy with
DNMT inhibitors. A few tentative conclusions could be
drawn: 1) clofarabine showed activity in patients with
MDS, including poor prognostic groups; 2) lower doses
appeared to achieve similar responses as higher doses but
with the added benefit of better tolerability; and 3) there
still remained questions about optimal dose, schedule,
and target population. Although there is ongoing interest
in optimizing the oral formulation of clofarabine (see
below), the intravenous route remains attractive and has a
longer track record above all in patients with AML, and
also there is no defined best schedule in MDS.
In the current study, we therefore compared, in an
adaptively randomized fashion, clofarabine IV 15 mg/m2
versus 30 mg/m2, daily 5. We report an ORR of 36%
(including a CR rate of 26%), an 8-week mortality rate of

19%, and a median overall survival of 7.4 months (13.4
months for responding patients). Responses in patients
who have failed DNMT inhibitors were lower (17%).
There is no large-scale experience of response rates to second-line therapy of patients who have failed DNMT inhibitor therapy, partly because of a lack of standard
practice and hence a variety of different therapies that are
being applied (if any). The lower response rate in this situation, however, is in keeping with our previous experience of oral clofarabine.11 The side effect profile was
consistent with previous reports. Although more patients
were randomized to the lower-dose arm, the study was
open until accrual was complete, and was not stopped prematurely, as the statistically defined stopping rules were
not met. This means that the trial remained inconclusive
regarding determination of a superior dose schedule.
Nevertheless, from a clinical point of view, a few observations are important. As has also been shown in previous
trials, lower doses (at least down to 15 mg/m2/dose) can
achieve at least similar response rates as higher doses. In
the multivariate analysis, more important than dose, however, was prior treatment with DNMT inhibitors. Dose
had a bigger impact with respect to toxicities grade >2.
Lower doses were better tolerated. Although the

distribution of grade 2 toxicities did not differ much,
there were more patients suffering from grade >2 adverse
events with respect to renal insufficiency and elevations of
transaminases and/or hyperbilirubinemia. Even at lower
doses, clofarabine retains its myelosuppressive properties,
and as a consequence, myelosuppression-related infections remain a major concern, and patients need close follow-up throughout their treatment course, although the
treatment can be delivered on an outpatient basis.
The current study continues not to provide a definitive answer as to the definition of an optimal dose and
schedule, nor does it answer the question of whether there
is any advantage to the IV schedule over the oral formulation. Both appear comparable at equitoxic doses. The
choice of an optimal dose and schedule remains problematic for a variety of reasons, including differences of pharmacokinetics between IV and oral administration of
clofarabine, differences in toxicities because of patient
selection and exposure to prior DNMT inhibitors, and
distribution of patients with secondary versus primary
MDS. Although there is a trend to reduce the dose of clofarabine with the main purpose to decrease toxicity, there
are also concerns that too low a dose (eg, <15 mg/m2)
may sacrifice response. Unpublished data from an
ongoing trial at The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center suggest that a flat dose of 10 mg orally
daily for 5 days may not be effective enough to pursue.
Other investigators have taken a similar approach to us.
Sekeres et al reported on 22 assessable patients with
mainly higher-risk MDS who received 55 mg, 35 mg, or
25 mg of a fixed dose of oral clofarabine daily for 5 days
every 4 weeks.19 The preliminary conclusion was that 55
mg was too toxic (2 of 4 patients died within 30 days),
and that 25 mg had an acceptable safety (no induction
deaths) and response profile (4 of 10 patients achieved a
marrow remission). Unfortunately, there are no preclinical models, and trial designs are primarily made based on
clinical empiricism. As DNMT inhibitors and clofarabine
together might be more active, another ongoing study is
evaluating a DNMT inhibitor alternating with clofarabine in patients with higher-risk MDS. Other schedules
of clofarabine including lower doses given over a prolonged time >5 days are also being evaluated. Although
currently no specific recommendation regarding an optimal schedule of clofarabine in MDS is possible, there is
sufficient activity to warrant further clinical trials. Any
promising lead from smaller single-institution trials
should be validated and confirmed in larger multicenter
clinical studies.
