BACKGROUND: We assessed the efficacy of taxane chemotherapy in BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated patients
compared with sporadic metastatic breast cancer patients. METHODS: Response rates (RRs) to and progression-free
survival (PFS) after taxane chemotherapy of 35 BRCA1-associated and 13 BRCA2-associated metastatic breast cancer
patients were compared with those outcomes in 95 matched (1:2) sporadic patients. Matching was performed for
age at and year of diagnosis of primary breast cancer, year of metastatic disease, and line of therapy (first vs second
or third). RESULTS: Among BRCA1-associated patients, the RR was worse (objective response [OR], 23% vs 38%; progressive disease [PD], 60% vs 19%; P < 0.001); and the median PFS shorter (2.2 vs 4.9 months; P ¼ 0.04) compared
with sporadic patients. In the subgroup of hormone receptor (HRec)-negative patients, BRCA1-associated patients
(n ¼ 20) had a worse RR (OR, 20% vs 42%, respectively; PD, 70% vs 26%, respectively; P ¼ 0.03) and a shorter PFS
(1.8 vs 3.8 months; P ¼ 0.004) compared with sporadic patients (n ¼ 19). These outcomes in HRec-positive patients
were similar in BRCA1-associated (n ¼ 11) and sporadic (n ¼ 61) patients (OR, 36% vs 38%; PD, 28% vs 20%; median
PFS, both 5.7 months). In BRCA2-associated patients, who were mainly HRec-positive, the OR was higher than in
sporadic patients (89% vs 38%, respectively; P ¼ 0.02), whereas the median PFS was not significantly different (7.1 vs
5.7 months, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: BRCA1-associated, HRec-negative metastatic breast cancer patients were
less sensitive to taxane chemotherapy than sporadic HRec-negative patients. HRec-positive BRCA1- and BRCA2associated patients had a sensitivity to taxane chemotherapy similar to that of sporadic patients. Cancer

The taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel are microtubule-stabilizing agents that have become widely recognized as active

cytotoxic agents for the treatment of early and advanced breast cancer.1-3 A recent meta-analysis has shown that the addition of a taxane to an anthracycline-based regimen improves disease-free and overall survival of high-risk early breast cancer patients.2 In advanced disease, treatment with taxane chemotherapy has shown response rates (RRs) between 35% and
60% and a time to progression of 5-9 months, depending on pretreatment with anthracyclines and line of therapy given.3
However, the downsides of taxane chemotherapy are the possibly serious side effects such as neutropenic fever, muscle
cramps, peripheral neuropathy, and relevant fatigue.3
Growing evidence from preclinical studies suggests that sensitivity to taxanes requires a functional BRCA1 protein.4-7 In response to the abnormal mitosis induced by taxanes, BRCA1 protein activates the mitotic spindle checkpoint and promotes apoptosis mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway,
leading to cell death.8,9 Until now, for the BRCA2 protein there is no evidence for a pathophysiological link with
the efficacy of taxanes.
Clinical data confirming these preclinical findings are very scarce. In a neo-adjuvant study, the percentage of patients
achieving a partial or complete response after treatment with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin was lower in

BRCA1-associated compared with sporadic breast cancer
patients (in 6/15 vs 12/12 patients, respectively; P ¼
0.001).10 In another retrospective, neo-adjuvant study
among BRCA1 mutation carriers, treatment with taxanebased therapy resulted in a low percentage of pathologic
complete responses (2/25 [8%] patients), whereas this
percentage was 22% for antracycline-based therapy (11/
51 patients) and 83% after cisplatin monotherapy (10/12
patients), suggesting inferior chemosensitivity to taxane
chemotherapy for BRCA1 mutation carriers.11 Regarding
metastatic breast cancer, it has been reported that patients
with loss of BRCA1 protein expression (n ¼ 13) determined via immunohistochemistry have a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) after taxane chemotherapy
compared with patients with BRCA1 protein expression
(n ¼ 6) (6.5 vs 14.7 months, respectively).12 However,
the relevance of this finding is unclear, because measuring
BRCA1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry is
inaccurate and can lead to an overestimation of patients
with loss of BRCA1 protein expression, and loss of
BRCA1 protein expression does not necessarily imply dysfunctional BRCA1 protein. Regarding BRCA2, it has
been reported in a small study (n ¼ 25) that a low
as opposed to a high BRCA2 messenger RNA (mRNA)
level was correlated with a higher RR to taxane
chemotherapy.13
Aiming at improved treatment for BRCA mutation
carriers, it is crucial to obtain more clinical data on the efficacy of taxane chemotherapy in BRCA mutation carriers. Therefore, we investigated the RR and PFS in
BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated compared with sporadic
metastatic breast cancer patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Using the database of the Family Cancer Clinic of the
Erasmus MC-Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, we identified all female patients with invasive breast cancer belonging to a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation family and having
been treated with docetaxel or paclitaxel for metastatic
disease, irrespective of treatment line (n ¼ 48). Selected
patients included proven BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation
carriers (n ¼ 41), as well as obligate mutation carriers
(n ¼ 1) and first-degree family members of mutation carriers diagnosed with breast cancer 55 years of age who
had not been tested themselves (n ¼ 6).
Each BRCA-associated patient was matched with 2
sporadic breast cancer patients derived from the institutional registry. Patients were matched for age at and year

900

of primary breast cancer diagnosis (within 5 years), year of
diagnosis of metastatic disease (within 5 years), line of
administration of taxane chemotherapy (first line vs second or third line), and concomitant trastuzumab treatment (yes/no). Patients diagnosed with a second primary
breast cancer within 10 years after the first primary cancer
(n ¼ 10) were matched for age at and year of diagnosis of
the first breast cancer, whereas patients diagnosed with a
second primary breast cancer 10 years or more after the
first primary cancer (n ¼ 4) were matched for age at and
year of diagnosis of the second primary breast cancer.
Medical records from the potentially eligible sporadic
breast cancer patients were evaluated for family cancer history. Patients with sporadic breast cancer were excluded if
they had 2 additional family members with breast cancer
(irrespective of age), or 1 additional family member diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50 years or with
ovarian cancer (any age). The study was approved by the
Medical Ethical Committee of the Erasmus University
Medical Center, Rotterdam, and the Netherlands (MEC
2009-344).
For each patient, data on patient and tumor characteristics, adjuvant systemic treatment, disease recurrence,
type of and response to treatment for metastatic disease,
and death were extracted from the medical records. For
patients diagnosed with a second primary breast cancer
within 10 years after the first breast cancer, tumor characteristics of the first breast cancer were considered. In the
other 4 cases, the characteristics of the second primary
breast cancer were considered.
Taxane chemotherapy for metastatic disease could
have been given as first-, second-, or third-line chemotherapy. Docetaxel was given every 3 weeks (100 mg/
m2) or weekly (30-36 mg/m2), while paclitaxel was
administered either every 3 weeks (175 mg/m2) or in a
weekly regimen (90 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15,
repeated every 4 weeks). Response evaluation was performed after every 2 or 3 cycles of chemotherapy, or
earlier in case of symptoms suggestive of progressive
disease. Response was assessed by means of International Union Against Cancer criteria,14 because a large
portion of the patients were treated before the introduction of the RECIST criteria in 2000. Objective
response (OR) was defined as complete response (CR)
(disappearance of all known disease) or partial response
(PR) (50% decrease in measurable lesions and objective improvement in evaluable lesions). Stable disease
was defined as lesions unchanged (ie, <50% decrease
and <25% increase in the size of measurable lesions).

Progressive disease (PD) was defined as progression of
some or all lesions (25% increase) and/or appearance
of new lesions. In case of response or the absence of
PD, chemotherapy was given for 6 cycles in total. Continuation of chemotherapy was dependent on toxic
adverse effects and the discretion of the treating physician. After the introduction of trastuzumab as evidence-based therapy, taxane chemotherapy was
administered in combination with trastuzumab for
patients with Her-2/neu–positive breast cancer (2
BRCA1, 4 sporadic). Patients with estrogen-positive
breast cancer who stopped taxane chemotherapy and
who were still responding received endocrine therapy as
consolidation therapy.
Differences in patient and tumor characteristics
were analyzed using the Student t test (continuous variables) or Pearson’s chi-square test (categorical variables).
Differences in RR between BRCA1-associated and sporadic tumors were tested using a chi-square test for trend
(linear-by-linear association). PFS after taxane chemotherapy was defined as the period between the start of
chemotherapy and date of PD, and was assessed by the
Kaplan-Meier survival method. Using the Cox proportional hazard regression model, PFS was multivariately
assessed, adjusting for possible confounding factors,
including hormone receptor (HRec) status (negative/positive), adjuvant chemotherapy (yes/no), and site of first
relapse (visceral/bone/soft tissue). A negative HRec status
was defined as negativity of both estrogen receptor (ER)
and progesterone receptor (PR), and a positive HRec status was defined as ER and/or PR being positive. HRec status was considered as unknown if information on both
ER and PR status was lacking, or in case of negative ER
and unknown PR status. A cut-off level of 10% immunopositive cells was used for ER and PR positivity.
Because we found that HRec status was an effect modifier
(P<.007 for interaction; see Results), analyses were stratified for HRec status.
Furthermore, because PFS can be influenced by consolidation endocrine therapy after taxane-based therapy,
the analyses for PFS were repeated via exclusion of the
patients treated with consolidation endocrine therapy and
by censoring these patients at start of consolidation endocrine therapy. We also performed the analyses after
excluding the 2 BRCA1-associated patients and the 4 sporadic patients who were treated with a taxane in combination with trastuzumab. Two sided P<.05 was considered
statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed with the use of SPSS version 15.0 software.

RESULTS
Patient and Tumor Characteristics
Patient and tumor characteristics are presented in Table 1.
The mean age at diagnosis of the primary breast cancer
was 40 years, and the mean age at detection of metastatic
disease was 43 years. Compared with sporadic tumors,
BRCA1-associated tumors were significantly more often
lymph node and HRec-negative. Furthermore, as
expected, contralateral breast cancer was more often
observed in BRCA-associated than in sporadic patients,
reaching statistical significance regarding BRCA1-associated cases. The sites of first distant metastases and number
of metastatic sites at detection were not significantly different between BRCA1-associated, BRCA2-associated,
and sporadic patients.
Taxane Chemotherapy
Only a minority of patients (23% of BRCA1-associated
patients, 16% of sporadic patients) were treated with a
taxane as first-line therapy for metastatic disease (Table 2),
whereas the majority (77% of BRCA1-associated patients,
100% of BRCA2-associated patients, 84% of sporadic
patients) received docetaxel or paclitaxel as second- or
third-line therapy. Furthermore, the majority of patients
were treated with taxane monotherapy. Five patients (1
BRCA2-associated, 4 sporadic) initially treated with docetaxel switched to paclitaxel, and 1 sporadic patient receiving paclitaxel switched to docetaxel due to unacceptable
toxicity. Two BRCA1-associated patients (1 HRec-positive and 1 HRec-negative breast cancer) were treated with
the combination trastuzumab/taxane. They were matched
with 4 sporadic patients also being treated with the combination taxane/trastuzumab. Nine Her-2/neu–positive
breast cancer patients (1 BRCA2-associated, 8 sporadic)
did not receive trastuzumab in addition to taxane chemotherapy because they were treated before the era of trastuzumab as standard treatment for Her-2/neu–positive
disease. Three (9%) BRCA1-associated, 4 (31%)
BRCA2-associated, and 17 (18%) sporadic patients
received endocrine therapy after taxane chemotherapy as
consolidation therapy.
RRs and PFS
BRCA1-associated patients had a worse response compared with sporadic and BRCA2-associated patients (both
P<.001 for trend). Of the BRCA1-associated patients,
23% had an OR, compared with 84% and 38% of the
BRCA2-associated and sporadic patients, respectively
(Table 3). Furthermore, PD at first evaluation was

among HRec-positive patients, PFS was similar in both
groups (median, 5.7 months) (Table 4 and Figure 1B). In
addition, univariate Cox proportional hazard analyses
revealed significantly worse PFS in BRCA1-associated
patients compared with sporadic patients in HRec-negative but not HRec-positive patients (Table 5). After

remained similar and significant for the HRec-negative

Because only 1 BRCA2-associated patient had an

HRec-positive BRCA2-associated patients had an OR significantly more often than sporadic patients (89% vs

censoring these patients at the start of therapy did not alter
the results (data not shown). Furthermore, performing all
analyses after excluding the 2 BRCA1-associated patients
and the 4 sporadic patients who were treated with a taxane
in combination with trastuzumab showed similar results
(data not shown).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study of metastatic
breast cancer patients to show that HRec-negative
BRCA1-associated patients were significantly less sensitive to taxane chemotherapy compared with HRec-negative sporadic patients, not only in terms of a lower RR but
also in terms of a shorter PFS. Among HRec-positive
patients, no significant differences regarding taxane chemotherapy efficacy were observed between BRCA1-associCancer

ated and sporadic patients. BRCA2-associated patients,
primarily those with HRec-positive breast cancer, were
found to be highly sensitive to taxane chemotherapy.
Based on preclinical data, there is growing evidence
that a functional BRCA1 protein is a necessary condition
for the cytotoxic effect of taxanes. The present study confirms the preclinical data, however, only for BRCA1-associated patients with HRec-negative and not HRecpositive breast cancer. This finding might suggest that
HRec-negative breast cancer (but not HRec-positive
breast cancer) could be subdivided into 2 subgroups: with
and without BRCA1 expression. This suggestion has been
made by Rodriguez et al,15 who reported that within triple-negative breast cancers, a defective DNA repair microarray gene expression pattern was associated with
sensitivity to anthracyclines and resistance to taxane
chemotherapy. However, a recent study observed that
BRCA1 mutation carriers with triple-negative breast cancer had survival similar to that of noncarriers when treated
with alkylating chemotherapy.16 A plausible explanation
for this finding is not yet known. Because the majority of
BRCA1-associated breast cancers are HRec-negative
(almost 80%),17 one could speculate that HRec-positive
breast cancers in BRCA1 mutation carriers are ‘‘sporadic’’
breast cancers (ie, they still have 1 functional BRCA1 allele left). However, this hypothesis has very recently been
rejected by Tung et al,18 who reported no difference in
the prevalence of loss of wild-type BRCA1 between estrogen receptor–positive and estrogen receptor–negative
BRCA1-associated breast cancers.
In the current study, we observed that BRCA2-associated patients (mostly HRec-positive) were highly sensitive to taxane chemotherapy in terms of a significantly
higher RR and a not significantly different PFS compared
with sporadic patients. Despite the small numbers, the
findings are interesting, especially because our data extend
on the very scarce available data hereon. To our knowledge, only 1 previous study suggested an inverse relationship between BRCA2 expression and sensitivity to taxane
chemotherapy.13 In that small study (n ¼ 25), it was
observed that breast cancers with a low BRCA2 mRNA
level had a higher response to taxane chemotherapy compared with breast cancers with a high BRCA2 mRNA
level. Although concordant with our findings, more studies including larger numbers of BRCA2-positive breast
cancer patients are warranted.
Despite the unique and interesting results, this study
has several limitations. First, it had a retrospective design,
and consequently patients were treated with various

905

Original Article

taxanes and/or schemes. It is known that paclitaxel given
in a weekly scheme is more effective than when administered in a thrice-weekly scheme.19 However, because only
a very limited number of patients (2 BRCA1-associated
[5%] and 5 sporadic [5%]) received paclitaxel in a thriceweekly scheme, we anticipate that this does not have a
major impact on the results.
Furthermore, compared with previously published
data on the efficacy of taxanes, our sporadic patients
showed comparable RRs (38% vs 35%-60%) and median
PFS (4.9 vs 5.0-9.0 months).3 This indicates that we constructed a representative patient group. Second, the Her2/neu status is unknown in a large portion of the patients.
However, despite being a marker of adverse prognosis
among patients not treated with trastuzumab, there are no
reasons to suggest that the efficacy of taxane chemotherapy differs among Her-2/neu–positive and Her-2/neu–
negative breast cancer patients. Also, because combination
treatment taxane/trastuzumab leads to a longer PFS, it is
reassuring that repeating the analyses excluding the
patients receiving trastuzumab did not alter our results. A
third shortcoming is that PFS could have been influenced
by consolidation endocrine therapy after taxane chemotherapy, which was given to 3 BRCA1-associated patients,
4 BRCA2-associated patients, and 17 sporadic patients.
As mentioned in the Results, performing analyses for PFS
by excluding patients treated with consolidation endocrine therapy and censoring these patients by date of start
of therapy showed similar results, leaving the conclusions
unaltered (data not shown).
Evidence is growing that various biomarkers could
be a marker for response to different chemotherapeutic
agents, as could BRCA deficiency. It has been reported
that BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated breast cancer
patients have an increased sensitivity to anthracyclines,
platinum, and poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase inhibitors.20-24 The findings of the current study
provide data on a reduced efficacy of taxane chemotherapy in HRec-negative BRCA1-associated patients compared with sporadic breast cancer patients. Whether
HRec status also plays a role in the sensitivity to other cytotoxic agents within the BRCA1-associated group has
not been investigated yet. From a clinical point of view,
however, the data presented here could be of great importance. If confirmed, this might already have implications
regarding the choice of (adjuvant) systemic chemotherapy. Therefore, larger and prospective studies are eagerly
needed to confirm our results. Meanwhile, it seems justified to treat patients with metastatic BRCA1-associated

906

breast cancer with anthracycline- or platinum-containing
agents before treating them with a taxane, especially in the
case of negative HRecs. Also, it becomes more and more
relevant to perform genetic testing for a BRCA mutation
at breast cancer diagnosis, especially in young (<50 years)
triple-negative cases, because therapy choice may depend
on the knowledge of a functional BRCA1 pathway in triple-negative breast cancer.
In conclusion, the current analyses showed a
reduced sensitivity to taxane chemotherapy in HRec-negative BRCA1-associated metastatic breast cancer patients
compared with age-matched, HRec-negative sporadic
patients. Taxane chemotherapy was similarly effective in
hormone-sensitive, BRCA1-associated patients compared
with sporadic patients. Larger prospective studies are
eagerly needed, because the findings could have a major
impact on the choice of the type of (adjuvant) chemotherapy for BRCA mutation carriers. Likewise, clinicians
should address genetic testing, especially in triple-negative
breast cancer at young age, at the diagnosis of breast
cancer.
