Abstract
Much attention has recently been focused on PIM kinases as
potential targets for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies and some solid cancers. Using protein stability shift
assays, we identified a family of imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines to
specifically interact with and inhibit PIM kinases with low
nanomolar potency. The high-resolution crystal structure of
a PIM1 inhibitor complex revealed that imidazo[1,2-b]pyrridazines surprisingly interact with the NH2-terminal lobe
helix AC rather than with the kinase hinge region. Thus, the
identified inhibitors are ATP competitive but not ATP mimetic
compounds, explaining their enhanced selectivity with respect
to conventional type I kinase inhibitors. One of the identified
imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines (K00135) was further tested in
several hematopoietic cellular systems. First, K00135 dosedependently impaired survival of murine Ba/F3 cells that have
been rendered cytokine independent by overexpression of
human PIMs. Second, K00135 impaired survival and clonogenic growth of a panel of human acute leukemia cells. Third,
exposure of K00135 significantly suppressed in vitro growth of
leukemic blasts from five acute myelogenous leukemia
patients but not of normal umbilical cord blood mononuclear
cells. In vitro kinase assays and immunoblotting using lysates
from human MV4;11 leukemic cells showed inhibition of
phosphorylation of known PIM downstream targets, such as
BAD and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E–binding
protein 1, by K00135. Taken together, we report a family of
small molecules that selectively interact and block PIM
kinases and could serve as a lead to develop new targeted
antileukemic therapeutics. [Cancer Res 2007;67(14):6916–24]

Introduction
Genetic alterations leading to uncontrolled protein tyrosine
kinase activity are a hallmark of myeloproliferative disorders.
Fusion genes involving ABL or platelet-derived growth factor
receptor are the molecular correlate of chronic myeloid leukemia,
whereas activating mutations of FLT3 or KIT are recurrently found
in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; refs. 1, 2). The

success of small molecules that block oncogenic tyrosine kinase
activity, like imatinib-mesylate (Gleevc, Novartis), provided a proof
of principle for targeted antileukemic therapy (3). However,
the successful clinical use of such specific inhibitors has been
challenged by the development of drug resistance and a limited
clinical efficacy in patients with acute leukemia (4). To overcome
these limitations, identification of critical signaling mediators
downstream of an oncogenic tyrosine kinase is essential to
delineate new targets that would allow development of an efficient
combined therapeutic approach. Strong evidence exists that most
oncogenic tyrosine kinases mediate malignant transformation by
parallel activation of several signaling pathways such as Janusactivated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription
(STAT), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, Ras/Raf/mitogenactivated protein kinase, or nuclear factor nB (1, 2).
Retroviral gene tagging in c-myc–induced murine lymphomas
led to identification of the PIM serine/threonine kinase family that,
in humans, encompasses three members: PIM1, PIM2, and PIM3
(5, 6). PIM1 has been characterized as one of the first target genes
of STAT5 (7, 8). Several groups have shown that constitutive STAT5
activation is a hallmark of a wide spectrum of hematologic
malignancies and that STAT5 is an essential mediator for transformation by oncogenic tyrosine kinases (9, 10). Interestingly,
PIM1 and PIM2 have been found to be overexpressed in leukemia
and lymphoma (11–13). Further in vitro functional studies have
provided evidence that activation of PIM1 and/or PIM2 is
important for malignant transformation by oncogenic tyrosine
kinases such as FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD),
expressed in f25% of human AML cases (12, 14–17). These studies
suggested that small molecules inhibiting PIM kinases could
provide a promising therapeutic avenue for hematologic malignancies.
To facilitate development of lead compounds, several groups
have reported the crystal structure of PIM1 in complex with a
number of ATP mimetic kinase inhibitors with broad kinase
inhibition profile (18–22). The crystal structures of PIM1 and PIM2
(pdb code 2IWI)4 showed that PIM kinases have an atypical hinge
region characterized by an insertion of one additional residue and
the presence of a proline that allows formation of only one
hydrogen bond with ATP or ATP mimetic inhibitors. Despite this
unique structural feature, all inhibitors published to date interact
with the kinase hinge region in a classic ATP mimetic way (18–22).
Here, we report imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines as inhibitors of PIM
kinases. Despite high sequence homology and conservation of the
active site, the identified inhibitors were on average 100-fold

selective for PIM1 over PIM2. The selected lead compounds were
highly selective and cross-reacted only with one additional kinase
(Cdc-like kinase 1) when screened against a panel of 50 kinase
catalytic domains. Determination of the cocrystal structure with
K00135 suggested that the unusual binding mode of the studied
inhibitor is responsible for the enhanced selectivity of this scaffold.
In addition, we show that this inhibitor has in vitro antileukemic
potential as shown in various cell line models as well as primary
AML patient samples.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification. Full-length human PIM1
(gi|33304198) was subcloned and protein was expressed and purified as
previously described (21). The masses of purified proteins were
confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using an Agilent
LC/MSD TOF system with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization and an orthogonal timeof-flight mass analyzer. The purified PIM1 protein was homogeneous
and had an experimental mass of 35,546 Da as expected from its primary
structure.
Kinase assay. Phosphorylation reactions were monitored using a
coupled-enzyme assay in which ADP production was coupled to NADH
oxidation by pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (23). The assay
was carried out in 100 AL of a buffer containing 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5),
100 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L phosphoenolpyruvate,
0.1 mmol/L NADH, 30 Ag/mL pyruvate kinase, 10 Ag/mL lactate
dehydrogenase, and either 20 nmol/L PIM1 or PIM2. The reaction was
monitored at 340 nm at 25jC on a Spectramax spectrophotometer
(Molecular Devices) and started by addition of 100 Amol/L ATP after a
10-min preincubation at 25jC. A recognition peptide of the PIM1 substrate
p21 (RKRRQTSMTD) was used at 30 Amol/L. DMSO-dissolved inhibitors
were added at the preincubation period resulting in a 2% final DMSO.
Kinetic analysis was done by nonlinear regression fitting using the program
KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software).
Protein stability shift assay. Thermal melting experiments were carried
out using the Mx3005p real-time PCR machine (Stratagene). Proteins
(2 Amol/L, final) were assayed in 10 AL of 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5),
150 mmol/L NaCl in a 96-well plate. Inhibitors were added at a final
concentration of 10 Amol/L. SYPRO Orange (Molecular Probes; dilution,
1:1,000) was added as a fluorescence probe. Excitation and emission filters
for the SYPRO-Orange dye were set at 465 and 590 nm, respectively. The
temperature was raised at 1jC/min from 25jC to 96jC and fluorescence
readings were taken at each interval. The temperature dependence of the
fluorescence during the protein denaturation process was approximated
by the equation
yU  yF
yðT Þ ¼ yF þ
1 þ euGðT Þ =RT
where DuG is the difference in unfolding free energy between the folded and
unfolded state, R is the gas constant, and y F and y U are the fluorescence
intensity of the probe in the presence of completely folded and unfolded
protein, respectively (24). The baselines of the denatured and native state
were approximated by a linear fit. The observed temperature shifts, DT mobs,
for each inhibitor were recorded as the difference between the transition
midpoints of sample and reference wells containing protein without
inhibitor in the same plate and determined by nonlinear least squares fit. All
compounds were purchased from BioFocus.
Crystallization. Nonphosphorylated PIM1 sample was concentrated
( final, 10 mg/mL) in the presence of ligands 0.7 mmol/L ‘‘pimtide’’
(ARKRRRHPSGPPTA-amide) and 1 mmol/L imidazopyridazine inhibitor.
Crystals were grown in a sitting drop setup at 4jC by mixing 100 nL of this
sample with 50 nL of precipitant [40% polyethylene glycol 300, 0.1 mol/L
Tris (pH 8.5), 0.2 mol/L Li2SO4]. The imidazopyridazine inhibitor [1-(3-{6[(cyclopropylmethyl)amino]imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-3-yl}phenyl) ethanone;

www.aacrjournals.org

referred as K00135] was purchased from BioFocus and added to a final
1 mmol/L from a 50 mmol/L stock in DMSO.
Structure determination. PIM1 diffraction data were collected on a
cryofrozen crystal (100K) at the Swiss Light Source synchrotron beam line
SLS-X10. Images were indexed and integrated using MOSFLM (25) and
scaled using SCALA (26) implemented in the CCP4 (CCP4, 1994) suite of
programs. The structure was solved using molecular replacement and the
program Phaser (27) using the PIM1 in a complex with the bisindolyl
maleide inhibitor BIM1 as a search model. Both structures were refined
with REFMAC5 (28) using iterative rounds of rigid-body and restrained
refinement with translation-libration-screw against maximum likelihood
targets, interspersed with manual rebuilding of the model using Xfit/
XtalView (29).
Coordinates. Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank
(pdb accession code 2C3I).
Reagents. Anti–phospho-BAD (Ser112), anti–phospho-BAD (Ser136), antiBAD, anti–phospho-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E–binding
protein 1 (4E-BP1; Thr37/46), and anti–phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr70) rabbit
polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
Anti-FLAG (clone M2) mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) was obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-actin antibody and anti-PIM1 mouse mAb were
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and anti-PIM2 rabbit polyclonal antibody
was from Abgent. Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al (MG132) was purchased from SigmaAldrich.
Generation of stable cell lines expressing human PIM1/PIM2 and
inhibitor treatment. The murine interleukin-3 (IL-3)–dependent hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3 was maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10%
FCS and 1 ng/mL recombinant murine IL-3 (PeproTech EC). The cDNAs
encoding human PIM1 and PIM2 were reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
amplified (with or without a FLAG tag) from mRNA extracted from human
leukemic cell line K562 and cloned into EcoRI/XhoI sites of pMSCVIRES-EYFP (PIM1) and into BgllI/EcoRI sites of pMSCV-IRES-EGFP (PIM2).
High-titer retroviral supernatants were produced as previously described
(17). Transduced Ba/F3 cells were selected for IL-3–independent growth.
Expression of FLAG-tagged PIM1/PIM2 was verified by real-time RT-PCR
and Western blotting (on treatment with 10 Amol/L MG123 for various
amounts of time). Cellular growth curves were established by daily counting
of the cultures at a starting density of 105 cells/mL. To investigate the effect
on the cell proliferation, K00135 (dissolved in DMSO) was added to the
culture medium (0.1, 1, and 10 Amol/L) and 0.1% DMSO was added to the
control cultures. Cell viability was analyzed by trypan blue dye exclusion
and normalized as percentage to control cultures after 24 h.
Human cell lines and treatment with PIM inhibitor. Human leukemia
cell lines MV4;11, RS4;11, MOLM13, KOCL45, SEM, KOPN8, and K562 were
purchased from DSMZ and maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin at 37jC in 5% CO2. To investigate the effect on the
cell proliferation, either K00135 (in DMSO, 0.1, 1, 10 Amol/L final) or 0.1%
DMSO was added to the culture medium and the cultures were incubated
for 48 h (1  105 cells in 1 mL). Cell proliferation and viability were assayed
using 200 AL of the initial culture and Cell Proliferation Reagent WST-1
from Roche Diagnostics according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell
survival was calculated as a percentage normalized to control cultures and
IC50 values were calculated using Forecast function of Excel.
Primary AML samples. Peripheral blood samples were collected with
informed consent from patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent AML.
Mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Histopaque and frozen in 10%
DMSO. Cells were then either used for colony formation assays, as described
below, or cultured in AIM-V medium (Cambrex) supplemented with 10%
FCS, 1 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cord blood
was isolated from healthy donors under informed consent, and mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Histopaque gradient and used as a
control for compound-related cytotoxicity. To investigate the effect on cell
proliferation, either K00135 (in DMSO, 1, 5, 10 Amol/L final) or 0.1% DMSO
was added to the culture (1  105 living cells/mL in 2 mL) and cell viability
analyzed by trypan blue dye exclusion after 24 h.
In vitro colony forming assay. Cells (104) were plated in methylcellulose (2 mL; MethoCult SFBIT H4236, StemCell Technologies) supplemented

with 10% FCS and either K00135 (1 or 4 Amol/L) or DMSO (0.1%) alone, and
grown in 35-mm Petri dishes in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2
at 37jC. Light microscopy was done 8 days later to assess colony formation (a colony was defined as a cluster of z50 cells). Mononuclear blood
cells (5  105) from the AML patients were plated in ‘‘complete’’
methylcellulose (2 mL; MethoCult GF H4534, StemCell Technologies)
supplemented with either K00135 (1, 5, and 10 Amol/L) or 1% DMSO alone
and grown as above. All cultures were inspected 10 days later for leukemic
cell growth and pictures were taken.
Analysis of apoptosis. MV4;11 cells were treated with 1 Amol/L K00135
for 48 h and analyzed at various time points by flow cytometry using both
violet fluorescent dye PO-PRO-1 (a sensitive indicator of apoptotic cells)
and 7-amino-actinomycin D (indicator of dead cells) from the Vybrant
Apoptosis Assay Kit #13 (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Protein extraction and Western blotting. MV4;11 cells were grown at
3  105/mL to 5  105/mL, treated with 1 to 3 Amol/L K00135 for various
times, harvested, and rinsed with ice-cold PBS. Ice-cold lysis buffer
[10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100,
0.5 mmol/L EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4,
protease inhibitor cocktail] was added to the cells and incubated on ice
for 20 min followed by 5-min microcentrifugation. Proteins were precipitated from supernatant using methanol-chloroform, and then pellets
were resuspended in Laemmli’s sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and
transferred to the membranes. The membranes were blotted with primary
antibodies (diluted according to the manufacturer’s recommendations),
followed by horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies, and
the proteins detected by SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity
Substrate (Pierce). The same blots were stripped and reprobed with desired
antibodies to confirm equal loading.
Immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assay. Cell lysates from
2 Amol/L K00135–treated MV4;11 cells (60 min) were prepared as
described above and incubated with either no antibodies or 2 Ag of
anti-PIM1/PIM2 antibody with gentle rocking at 4jC overnight. Protein
A-agarose beads (Upstate; 50 AL of 50% beads slurry in 500 AL of the
lysate) were added and incubated for additional 2 h, followed by 15-s
microcentrifugation, three washes with 300 mmol/L lysis buffer, and two
additional washes with kinase buffer [40 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
20 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin]. Beads were then
suspended in 50 AL of kinase buffer supplemented with 500 Amol/L ATP
and either no inhibitor or 2 Amol/L K00135 and incubated at 30jC for
30 min. Four micrograms of soluble BAD protein (Upstate) were then
added to the reaction and incubated for additional 30 min. The reactions
were terminated by addition of the Laemmli sample buffer and
phosphorylation of BAD was analyzed by Western blotting with anti–
phospho-BAD (Ser112/136) antibodies.

Inhibitor binding. Although the imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine
inhibitor binds to the ATP binding site of PIM1, surprisingly, it
does not mimic binding of ATP by forming hydrogen bonds with
the kinase hinge region (shown in magenta in Fig. 1B), but rather
binds to the opposite side of this pocket participating in a
hydrogen bond network formed by the conserved active site lysine
(Lys67), a structural water molecule, the aC residue of Glu89, and
the activation loop residue Phe187 (Fig. 1B). In addition, a number
of hydrophobic contacts, particularly with PIM1 residues Leu44,
Phe49, Ile104, and Leu120, stabilize this interaction. The unusual
hinge architecture of PIM1, which has a proline at the hinge
position 123, allows formation of only one hydrogen bond to ATP
or ATP mimetic inhibitors. We believe that this active site
architecture, together with the unexpected binding mode of the
studied imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine inhibitor, results in surprisingly
PIM-specific inhibitors. Indeed, the imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine that
cocrystallized with PIM1 interacted with only one other kinase

Results
Overall structure and substrate binding. The crystal structure
of the ternary complex of PIM1 with a consensus substrate peptide
and the inhibitor K00135 was determined at 1.9-Å resolution (Fig. 1;
Supplementary Table S1) revealing the kinase with the typical
bilobal architecture. The overall structure of the protein was found
to be similar to structures that have previously been described
(Fig. 1A; refs. 18–21). The serine/threonine kinase PIM1 has been
shown to have a strong preference for substrates with basic
residues, particularly arginine, at positions 5 and 3 (21, 22).
Peptide library screening has defined additional selectivity for
histidine at 2, proline at 1, and glycine at +1, facilitating the
design of a high-affinity consensus peptide, pimtide (ARKRRRHPS*
GPPTA). As in the case of the PIM1-BIM1 peptide complex (22),
the substrate peptide was well defined between residues Lys6 and
Gly1, whereas the termini were not visible in the electron density
and assumed to be disordered.

inhibitors based on the imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine scaffold targeting
PIM1 kinase and used temperature shift assays to identify and
rank-order ligands that interact with PIM kinases. This assay
monitors the linear affinity–dependent stability increase of
proteins and has been shown to correlate well with binding
constants and IC50 values (22). In the study done here, we also

confirmed an excellent correlation of temperature shift data (T m)
with IC50 values and identified several inhibitors (K00152 and
K00486) with improved potency compared with K00135 (Fig. 2A).
The structure-activity relationship of the library was established
with two varying positions (R1 and R2; Fig. 2B). The limited
variations in position R2 did not dramatically influence T m shift
values. This is supported by the cocrystal structure, which showed
that chemical moieties at that position interact with the glycinerich loop but larger moieties would point toward the solvent.
Aliphatic or saturated six-member ring systems at that position
resulted in slightly more potent inhibitors than the tricyclic ring
present in K00135. Within the inhibitor series tested, a trifluoromethoxy moiety in meta position of the aromatic substitution in

R1 showed the highest affinity for PIM1 (Fig. 2). Our crystal
structure suggests that the larger trifluoro-methoxy moiety might
favorably interact with the side chain of Arg122. K00135 binding was
also confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry, revealing a K D
of 25 nmol/L and a strongly enthalpy-driven interaction (not
shown). It was interesting to see that, in general, PIM2 inhibition
was 10- to 100-fold weaker than IC50 values measured for PIM1
(Fig. 2). This finding is very surprising considering the high
homology between the PIM1 and PIM2 active sites. In fact, there is
only one single conservative change within the ATP pocket:
comparison with the PIM2 crystal structure (pdb code 1IWI)
showed PIM1 Val126 is an alanine residue in PIM2. The close
contact of Val126 side chain and the carbonyl oxygen of the substitution of the aromatic R2 moiety of the inhibitor is 4 Å. This
interaction is not likely to contribute to the binding of the inhibitor,
but an amino acid substitution at this position might influence the
flexibility of the kinase hinge region. PIM3 interaction with the
investigated inhibitors seems to be more similar to PIM1 (Fig. 2).
Two hits identified in the screen were particularly interesting;
K00486 had an IC50 of 34 nmol/L against PIM1 and only an IC50 of
2.5 Amol/L against PIM2 with an identical selectivity profile,
whereas K00152 inhibited PIM1 with an IC50 of 39 nmol/L (PIM2
7 Amol/L) but also inhibited polo-like kinase 1 in our profiling for
specificity (data not shown).
Ba/F3 cells stably expressing human PIMs. To address
inhibition of PIM kinases by K00135 in a cellular system, we
established a series of murine IL-3–dependent Ba/F3 cells that
stably expressed human hPIM1 or hPIM2 by retroviral gene
transfer. Stable expression of hPIM1 or hPIM2 allows the cells to
survive in the absence of IL-3 (Fig. 3A, top; ref. 30). To increase the

sensitivity of detection of hPIM proteins, we also generated Ba/F3
cells stably expressing NH2-terminal FLAG-tagged human PIM
kinases. No differences in cell growth were observed when tagged
or untagged hPIM kinases were expressed (not shown). Interestingly, although we were able to detect high levels of hPIM mRNAs
(not shown), only relatively low levels of steady-state hPIM proteins
were observed (Fig. 3A, bottom). This is probably due to the short
half-life of PIM proteins in vivo and their rapid proteosomal
degradation. Treatment of the cells with the proteosome inhibitor
MG132 led to a substantial increase in hPIM protein levels, in
particular for hPIM1 (Fig. 3A, bottom; ref. 31). To address the effect
of K00135 in Ba/F3 cells stably overexpressing hPIMs, we exposed
the cells to different concentrations of K00135, ranging from
nanomolar to low micromolar levels. Survival of the cells was
determined after 24 h by trypan blue dye exclusion. As shown in
Fig. 3B, a dose-dependent decrease in cell survival was observed
after 24 h in Ba/F3-hPIM1 grown in the absence of IL-3. Cells
expressing hPIM2 were less sensitive to K00135, as expected from
the higher IC50 values for PIM2 determined for this compound
(Fig. 2). Despite better potency in in vitro kinase assays, effects
on cell survival using the two inhibitors K00152 and K00486 were
similar (data not shown). Importantly, no significant decrease in
viability was observed in wild-type Ba/F3 cells growing in IL-3 and
in the presence of all three inhibitors tested. These experiments
show that imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines interact with and inhibit
hPIM1 and, to a lesser extent, hPIM2 in a cellular system. In
addition, these compounds do not seem to interfere with molecules
of murine origin that are critical for IL-3–mediated cell growth.

cell lines, and cell viability (as in Fig. 3B) and IC50 values were determined
24 and 48 h later (C).

were tested in a series of human leukemia cell lines (MV4;11,
RS4;11, MOLM13, KOCL45, SEM, KOPN8, and K562). As shown
in Fig. 4, some cytotoxic effects of K00135 were observed in all
cell lines tested. Interestingly, cell lines that harbor the FLT3-ITD
mutation, such as MV4;11 or MOLM13, were up to 20 times more
sensitive than K562 cells that originate from BCR/ABL–positive
blast crisis patient (Fig. 4C). We also assessed the effect of K00135
on clonogenic growth of leukemic cells. Among the cell lines
included in our study, only MV4;11, MOLM13, and K562 were able
to form colonies (>50 cells) when plated in methylcellulose (not
shown). A significant reduction in clonogenic growth was observed
in MV4;11 and MOLM13 even at an inhibitor concentration of
<1 Amol/L, whereas colony formation of K562 was not affected
even at a higher dose as expected from the relative resistance of
this cell line to the treatment with this inhibitor class (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
K00135 induces apoptosis in human leukemic cell line
MV4;11. K00135 induced cytotoxicity in both hPIM1/hPIM2–
overexpressing Ba/F3 cells and all leukemic cell lines tested. To
determine the mechanism of K00135-mediated cell death, we
measured by flow cytometry the induction of apoptosis in MV4;11
cells treated with 1 Amol/L K00135 at different time points after
inhibitor exposure. We used both dye PO-PRO-1, which is a
sensitive indicator of apoptotic cells, and 7-amino-actinomycin D,
an indicator of dead cells. The percentage of apoptotic MV4;11
cells increased in a time-dependent manner, with 2.8% of the
cells undergoing apoptosis and 15.3% dead after 12 h and 8.5%
apoptotic and 40.5% dead cells after 36 h of treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
K00135 impairs phosphorylation of PIM downstream
targets. To show that PIM kinases are indeed targeted by

K00135 in leukemic cells, we monitored the in vitro kinase activity
of immunoprecipitated PIM on its downstream targets by Western
blotting with phospho-specific antibodies. The antiapoptotic
protein BAD has been shown to be directly serine phosphorylated
by both PIM1 and PIM2 (32, 33). To show inhibition of PIM activity
in MV4;11 cells, PIM protein was immunoprecipitated and analyzed for its ability to phosphorylate BAD (on Ser112 and Ser136)
in vitro in the presence (1 h) or absence of K00135 (2 Amol/L). As
shown in Fig. 5A, phosphorylation of BAD by PIM1 and PIM2 was
abrogated on addition of the compound. To further analyze the
effects of K00135 on PIM function, phosphorylation of two known
direct PIM targets (BAD and 4E-BP1) was followed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5B, short-term exposure of the cells to
1 Amol/L K00135 led to a significant decrease of phosphorylation
of BAD and 4E-BP1. In contrast, no changes in phosphorylation of
FLT3-ITD or Akt/protein kinase B were observed (data not shown).
These results suggest that K00135 exerts its effects in MV4;11 by
interfering primarily with PIM kinases downstream of FLT3-ITD or
Akt/protein kinase B.
K00135 impairs in vitro survival of primary leukemic blasts.
Next, we analyzed the effects of K00135 on the growth of leukemic
blasts from five patients with newly diagnosed AML. When
cultured in methylcellulose, the cells from AML patients grew in
small clusters (Fig. 6B) and were therefore not amendable to be
analyzed by classic quantitative colony forming assays. However,
as shown in Fig. 6A, exposure of leukemic blasts in a short-term
liquid culture to K00135 resulted in a significant decrease in
survival for all patient samples. Although K00135 showed an effect
on colony formation of all primary cells analyzed, no significant
difference in survival between the patients harboring FLT3-ITD
(patients 1 and 2) or those without (patients 3–5) was observed.

Finally, we have addressed the cytotoxic effects of K00135 on
normal human cord blood cells at antileukemic doses. As shown
in Fig. 6C, K00135, at concentrations of 1 to 10 Amol/L, had only a
minor effect on survival of normal umbilical blood mononuclear
cells from four healthy donors.

Discussion
Recent reports showing that PIM kinases are involved in
malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells by oncogenic
tyrosine kinases provided a strong rationale for development of
PIM kinase inhibitors as potential therapeutics (11–17). All PIM
inhibitor structures that have been published to date interact with
the kinase hinge region in a classic ATP mimetic way. Screening
of a kinase-targeted library and structure-activity relationship
analysis allowed us to identify several imidazo[1,2]pyridazines with
high affinity for PIM1. Related inhibitors of the pyrazolpyrimidine

Figure 6. K00135 impairs in vitro survival of primary leukemic blasts.
A, leukemic blasts from five patients were grown in liquid cultures without the
drug or with increasing amounts of K00135, and cell viability was determined
24 h later (expressed as a percentage normalized to viability of cells treated with
0.1% DMSO only). B, when cultured in methylcellulose in the presence of
K00135, significantly lower density of characteristic small leukemic clusters was
observed as compared with control cultures (shown only for one patient sample;
right ). C, cytotoxic effects of K00135 (at antileukemic doses) were analyzed in
liquid cultures of umbilical vein–derived mononuclear cells from four healthy
donors, and cell viability was determined as percentage compared with viability
of cells treated with DMSO only. Columns, mean of two independent
experiments, each done in triplicate; bars, SD.

A, PIM proteins were immunoprecipitated from MV4;11 cells and the
agarose-protein A-immunoprecipitate complex was tested for its ability to
phosphorylate BAD in vitro in the presence or absence of K00135.
Phosphorylation of BAD (both on Ser112 and Ser136, detected by Western blotting
with phospho-specific antibodies) was abrogated on addition of the compound.

Beads alone (without anti-PIM antibodies) were incubated with the MV4;11
extract and used for the same in vitro phosphorylation reaction as a negative
control. B, MV4;11 cells were incubated with 1 Amol/L K00135 for indicated
times, harvested, and protein extracts separated by SDS-PAGE. The effect of
K00135 on PIM endogenous targets was followed by Western blotting with
indicated phospho-specific antibodies. Membranes were stripped and reprobed

class were first described as specific inhibitors of the Src family
of tyrosine kinases, with several pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines having
low nanomolar affinity for Lck and anticancer activity (34). One
of these compounds, PP1, was later crystallized in complex with
the autoinhibited form of Hck, providing further guidance for drug
development (35). Subsequently, this scaffold yielded specific
inhibitors for glycogen synthase kinase 3 and members of the
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family (36). Inhibitors based on the
variant pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine scaffold have also been described with specificity for CDK2 and the KDR kinase domain
(37–39). However, all published cocrystal structures of this
inhibitor class show binding to the kinase hinge region in the
expected type I binding mode. Here, we identified a binding mode
for our compound in which the inhibitor interacts with the
opposite side of the ATP binding pocket, without making
significant polar contacts with the kinase hinge region. In addition,
the DFG motif did not move into an ‘‘out’’ conformation as
observed in cocrystal structures of kinases with type II inhibitor
complexes. However, the described area of the binding pocket is
much more diverse than the hinge region, bearing the promise that

PIM Kinase Inhibitor with Antileukemic Activity

more specific inhibitors may be developed on the basis of the
determined crystal structure. Indeed, we observed cross-reactivity
with only one other kinase (Cdc-like kinase 1) within a panel of
50 serine-threonine kinases currently present in our laboratory.6
Several compounds that inhibit PIM1 in vitro with nanomolar
potency were selected for in vivo profiling using murine Ba/F3
cells overexpressing human PIM1 or PIM2 (30). Three compounds
showed a dose-dependent inhibition of cell survival in hPIMexpressing Ba/F3 cells, but not in wild-type cells growing in the
presence of IL-3 (Fig. 3). This suggests that PIM activity may not be
essential for growth and survival of murine Ba/F3 cells signaling
through IL-3, or simply that the compounds can interact and
inhibit only human but not mouse PIM kinases. Additional
experiments carried out with IL-3–independent Ba/F3 cells overexpressing mouse PIMs strongly suggest the latter possibility (data
not shown).
The nanomolar in vitro potencies of the selected inhibitors using
purified PIM protein translated into low micromolar potencies in
the Ba/F3 cell model. The compounds were further tested in
several human leukemia cell lines. Some AML cell lines such as
MV4;11 or MOLM13 were very sensitive to the selected PIM1
inhibitors with IC50 values well below 1 Amol/L in cell survival
studies; however, other cell lines, such as K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis), were less affected (Fig. 4C). The
molecular correlates that determine the sensitivity of PIM
inhibitors are currently unknown, but preliminary results suggest
that effects on cell survival may not fully correlate with PIM
kinase expression levels (data not shown). In addition to cytotoxic
effects, the tested inhibitors also significantly reduced the selfrenewal capacity of leukemic cells as shown by inhibition of their
clonogenic activity. Interestingly, there are several lines of evidence
suggesting that PIM1 may functionally cooperate with Gfi1, a
known regulator of self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (40). In
addition, the homeobox transcription factor HOXa9, another
regulator of self-renewal capacity and frequently deregulated in
human acute leukemia, seems to regulate expression of PIM1 in
hematopoietic stem cells, further supporting PIM1 as a therapeutic
target for this disease (41).
Indeed, exposure of blasts from five AML patients to our PIM1
kinase inhibitors leads to a significant reduction in cell survival
after 24 h (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, exposure of mononuclear cells
from human cord blood from four donors to the compounds was
associated with minimal cytotoxic effects (Fig. 6C). Mice lacking all
known PIMs (PIM1, PIM2, and PIM3) are fertile and have a normal
life span, suggesting that PIMs may not be essential for steady-state
homeostasis, although deregulated on malignant transformation
(42). Biochemical analysis strongly suggests that our compounds
indeed block PIM1 function and its downstream targets such as

BAD or 4E-BP1. However, a drawback of the identified compounds
may be that significant reduction of growth and survival of human
leukemia cell lines or primary samples could only be achieved at
relatively high (micromolar) compound concentrations. Further
experiments are necessary to determine whether micromolar
serum level can be achieved in a living organism. Additional
modification of the molecule core may further increase the affinity
of the compounds. Strategies to modify PIM expression and/or
stabilization may also be explored for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies, and possible additive effects of combinations
of PIM kinase inhibitors with heat shock protein-90 inhibitors
such as 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin derivatives
are currently investigated (31, 43). One should also keep in mind
that PIM kinases have been intensively characterized as proteins
of relatively weak inherent oncogenicity but potent in cooperation
with other oncogenes such as c-myc (44–47). Therefore, it is likely
that synergistic effects may be achieved in combination with
either traditional chemotherapeutics and/or other small molecules
that target signaling cascades linked to survival of the malignant
cells.
K00135 shows selectivity for PIM1. Although previous studies
have shown that an optimal PIM-targeted tumor therapy would
include inhibition of PIM2 (12, 15, 17), thus far, there is no potent
inhibitor for PIM2 available. Interestingly, all reported inhibitors
show selectivity for PIM1, suggesting that PIM2 is intrinsically
more difficult to target. This finding is surprising considering the
high sequence conservation of the PIM1 and PIM2 active sites. It
is therefore likely that dynamic variables that are currently not
understood may also play a role in the recognition process. Strong
research efforts are currently put into a search for PIM1 and PIM2
inhibitors.
This is the first report of a class of compounds that inhibit PIM
kinases with clear anticancer activity as shown in leukemic cell
lines as well as primary blasts from AML patients. Deregulated
expression of PIM1 in other hematologic tumors (high grade
lymphoma) and solid tumors, such as prostate carcinoma or oral
squamous cell cancer, suggests that efficient inhibition of these
kinases by small molecules may lead to potent targeted cancer
therapy (48–50).
