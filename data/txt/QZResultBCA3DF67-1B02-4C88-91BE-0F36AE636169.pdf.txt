ABSTRACT:
A T-to-G germline single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of MDM2
(SNP309) has been reported to markedly accelerate tumor formation in humans
suggesting that it may represent a powerful cancer predisposing allele. Since its first
description in 2004, a large number of retrospective analyses involving a wide variety
of human malignancies have been reported, showing conflicting results regarding the
impact of Mdm2SNP309 status on cancer risk and response to cancer therapy. Here, we
appraise the available information on the effect of Mdm2SNP309 in lymphoma and
leukemia and discuss the factors that likely account for the conflicting results
observed in the studies reported to date.

regulation of Mdm2 levels is necessary to maintain
proper p53 homeostasis and therefore p53-mediated
tumor suppression, which suggests that modest changes
in Mdm2 levels may have an important impact on
tumor development.
Recently, a functional T to G single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in the human Mdm2 gene
(SNP309G) has been identified [6]. This SNP enhances
the binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to the Mdm2
promoter which in turn results in increased Mdm2
mRNA levels and thereby lower p53 levels. Of
importance to cancer development, the Mdm2SNP309G
allele has been associated with an increased cancer risk
in some human tumors that express wild type p53 [79]. However, some reports have failed to show a
correlation between the Mdm2SNP309G allele and cancer
risk [10, 11]. The impact that Mdm2SNP309G has on
cancer risk is supported by the findings that patients
diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a
syndrome resulting from inherited germline mutations
in p53, that are also homozygous for the Mdm2SNP309G
allele develop tumors significantly earlier than patients
with LFS lacking this polymorphism [6, 12]. These
data suggest that increased Mdm2 levels resulting from

INTRODUCTION
Alterations in numerous tumor suppressor pathways
involving oncogene overexpression and loss of tumor
suppressors have been demonstrated to be crucial for
tumorigenesis. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor
p53 or components of the p53 pathway is common
during tumor development. TP53 encodes a
transcription factor that activates numerous genes that
halt tumorigenesis [1]. Mutations in the TP53 gene
occur in over 50% of human cancers [2]. Additionally,
some tumors have an ablated p53 pathway yet lack
TP53 mutations, suggesting alterations to other
components in the p53 pathway occur during
tumorigenesis [2]. One key component of the p53
pathway is Mdm2. This gene is amplified or
overexpressed in a large number of human cancers that
retain wild type TP53 [3, 4]. Mdm2 encodes an E3
ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates p53 protein
stability and transcriptional activity [5]. These data
demonstrate that decreased p53 activity, resulting from
mutations in the TP53 gene or alterations in Mdm2
significantly impact tumor development. Data derived
from mouse studies have shown that a fine tuned

the presence of the Mdm2SNP309G allele may further
down modulate an already deficient p53 pathway.
Relatively little is known regarding the impact that
subtle genetic modifiers have on tumorigenesis.
Examination of large cohorts of patients carrying the
Mdm2SNP309 allele suggests that subtle changes to the
p53 pathway may have a pronounced impact on
tumorigenesis. Several caveats hamper a proper
interpretation of such clinical studies, including the fact
that they are retrospective in nature, with all the biases
associated with such type of analyses, and the fact that
they involve patients from different ethnic
backgrounds, therefore not accounting for the potential
impact that other gene modifiers (e.g. other SNPs) may
have on the p53 pathway. Certainly an unbiased
prospective analysis of patients with cancer is
warranted to definitely delineate the impact of the
Mdm2SNP309 allele on cancer risk and response to
therapy. The development of mouse models mimicking
the human Mdm2SNP309 allele may advance
significantly our understanding of the impact that
subtle genetic differences may have in the regulation of
the p53 pathway. Alterations in the p53 pathway have
been reported in an important fraction of patients with
leukemia or lymphoma. In this paper we appraise the
available information on the impact of the Mdm2SNP309
allele in lymphomagenesis and leukemogenesis.

CLL is the most frequent leukemia in the western
hemisphere with an incidence rate of 4/100000. The
incidence rates in men are nearly twice as high as in
women. CLL is characterized by the accumulation of
mature CD5+, CD19+ B-lymphocytes in the
hematopoietic system [15, 16]. Several prognostic
factors have been linked to a poor prognosis in patients
with CLL. Among them, the presence of unmutated
immunoglobulin (Ig)-VH gene and the expression of
CD38 and Zap70 are the ones that have shown more
robust results as risk factors in clinical trials [15]. p53
plays a critical role in regulating tumor growth and p53
status has been shown to be critical for survival of
patients with CLL. p53 inactivation has been
documented in patients with CLL primarily due to
17p13 deletion and point mutations. Patients with CLL
exhibit a deletion of 17p13 in approximately 5–7% in
early stage disease and in 25–40% in advanced and/or
refractory disease [17]. Patients with the 17p13
chromosomal abnormality exhibit very aggressive
disease, poor response to chemotherapy, and a very
poor prognosis [18]. In addition, TP53 mutations can
be detected in up to 20-30% of patients with CLL [17],
which implies that, in the remaining cases, possibly
other alterations in the p53 pathway may be involved in
CLL. Interestingly, overexpression of Mdm2, a major
p53 regulator has been shown in 28% of patients with
B-CLL. The well documented functional association of
Mdm2SNP309 in human tumors, and the important
prognostic role of p53 in CLL, provides the rationale
for studying the prognostic and predictive implications
of Mdm2SNP309in patients with CLL.
The very first study investigating the impact of
Mdm2SNP309 on leukemogenesis did not find any
difference in the mean age at diagnosis between the
different Mdm2SNP309 genotype subsets [19]. In
addition, the authors did not find any significant
association between the Mdm2SNP309 and the p53 codon
72 arginine-to-proline (p53R72P) polymorphisms or
other prognostic markers such as the mutational status
of the VH gene, CD38 expression and Zap70
expression. However, the limited cohort size in this
study (n=83) precluded a robust statistical analysis. In
contrast, another study reported that carrying the
Mdm2SNP309G allele was associated with a decreased
risk of leukemia in patients of Chinese origin [20].
However, once again a small cohort size and clubbing
together different kinds of leukemia patients made the
results difficult to interpret.

IMPACT OF THE MDM2SNP309 ALLELE ON
LEUKEMOGENESIS
The tumor suppressor TP53 is mutated in more than
50% of all human solid tumors and in approximately
30% of patients with leukemia. Notably, p53 has been
shown to play a critical role in hematopoiesis.
Fluctuations in p53 levels and activity result in drastic
consequences to the hematopoietic compartment, as
demonstrated in mouse models with haploinsufficiency
of its negative regulators Mdm2 and Mdm4 [13, 14].
The Mdm2SNP309 allele has been associated with
attenuation of p53 activity and early onset of human
cancers [6]. Extrapolation of these results to examine
the impact of the Mdm2SNP309 allele on leukemogenesis
has rendered multiple studies reporting conflicting
results. Three major types of leukemia, chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) have been primarily investigated with
regards to Mdm2SNP309 status and outcome.

In the first major systematic study, Gryschenko et
al. analyzed two different cohorts of patients (n=140
and n=111, respectively) and showed that occurrence
of homozygous (G/G) Mdm2SNP309 did not predispose
to CLL [21]. However, patients that were either
heterozygous (T/G) or homozygous (G/G) at the
Mdm2SNP309 loci had significantly shortened treatment
free survival (TFS) and overall survival (OS) in
comparison to patients with the (T/T) genotype.
Multivariate analysis also identified Mdm2SNP309 as an
independent prognostic factor for TFS and OS. In
contrast, an unbiased analysis of a large cohort of
patients with CLL (n=418) did not detect any
association of Mdm2SNP309 and time to first treatment
and overall survival [22]. Likewise, no apparent
correlation between the different Mdm2SNP309
genotypes and Binet stage or IgVH mutational status
was identified. Another study involving an even larger
cohort of patients (n=617) also confirmed these results
and could not detect any correlation between
Mdm2SNP309 and the other established prognostic
markers in CLL [23]. Carrying the Mdm2SNP309 allele
did not impact OS.
A recent study from Sweden involving 210 patients
with CLL followed for over 19 years reported that the
OS of patients with at least one Mdm2SNP309G allele was
significantly shorter than that of patients with two
Mdm2SNP309T alleles [24]. However, the age of onset of
B-CLL was similar between the two genotypes. The
presence of an Mdm2SNP309G allele in combination with
TP53 mutations or unmutated IgVH gene status resulted
in an additional risk. This study supported the claim by
Gryschenko et al. of Mdm2SNP309 as a prognostic
marker in concert with TP53 mutations and unmutated
IgVH status. However, these data are in conflict with
Kaderi et al and Zenz et al, which could be explained
by the difference in patient cohort composition in these
studies. Differences in the number of patients with
unmutated IgVH gene and a higher proportion of
advanced Binet stage patients may have accounted for
such discrepant results. Additionally, unlike
Gryschenko et al., the authors did not observe any
reduction in TFS in patients carrying two Mdm2SNP309T
versus two Mdm2SNP309G alleles, suggesting that
Mdm2SNP309 mainly influences the outcome of therapy.
This contention is intriguing particularly in light of
data reported by Saddler et al. showing that treatment
with nutlin-3a, a drug that disrupts the interaction
between Mdm2 and p53, efficiently induces apoptosis
of B-CLL cells in vitro [25]. Similar results were also
reported by Seyfried et al [26]. Moreover, a recent

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

report analyzing a small cohort of patients with CLL
(n=75) in conjunction with studies involving the TCL1
mouse model, an established mouse model of B-CLL,
showed that miR34a, a p53 downstream pro-apoptotic
target gene expression correlates with Mdm2SNP309
status [27]. Mdm2SNP309G/G or Mdm2SNP309T/G patients
with wild type p53 have a lower expression of miR34a
and lower TFS. In aggregate, these data suggest that
Mdm2SNP309T/G or Mdm2SNP309G/G genotypes possibly
alleviate the sensitivity to chemotherapy regimens by
suppressing the p53 pro-apoptotic activity.
In addition to CLL, studies have also focused on
ALL, a leading cause of childhood cancer. ALL
accounts for 25-30% of all diagnoses in infants below 1
year of age. p53 mutations are rare in childhood ALL.
However, components of the p53 pathway are
frequently found mutated in ALL [28]. Indeed, deletion
or transcriptional silencing of p14ARF is frequent in
ALL, while Mdm2 overexpression or silencing of the
p53 transcriptional target p21CIP1 has been reported in
approximately 50% of patients with ALL and linked
with worse prognosis [28]. Analyses of 284 samples
obtained from children with ALL revealed that the
presence of the Mdm2SNP309G allele significantly
decreased the age of onset for ALL in Caucasian and
African-American patients but not Hispanic patients
[29]. These findings suggest an ethnic specific effect of
Mdm2SNP309 in ALL, which has also been reported in
patients with solid tumors. A separate study of 114
children with ALL however could not confirm any
statistical correlation between Mdm2SNP309 and age of
onset of ALL [30]. Nonetheless, a sex specific effect of
the polymorphism on earlier disease onset was
identified. Females that are homozygous carriers of the
Mdm2SNP309G allele had a significantly earlier disease
onset compared to those carrying two Mdm2SNP309T
alleles. While estrogen has earlier been shown to affect
Mdm2SNP309 activity, this observation is quite
interesting given the fact that children with ALL have
negligible estrogen activity. While it could be
hypothesized that fetal estrogen exposure may impact
postnatal Mdm2 activity, a more detailed investigation
of a larger cohort of patients is required to confirm this
hypothesis.
Several studies have addressed the possibility of an
association between Mdm2SNP309 and the development
of therapy related AML. Therapy related AML arises
as a consequence of prior cytotoxic therapy and as
many as 10% of patients treated for a first cancer
develop this potentially fatal secondary malignancy.
Examination of two cohorts of patients (n=80 and

ATM, Mdm4, or p14ARF may likewise affect p53
function. A multivariate, detailed analysis (metaanalysis) of a larger cohort of a more biologically
homogenous population will be more informative in
this regard.
Given these complexities, the examination of
Mdm2SNP309 status in isolation as a prognostic marker
for CLL, ALL or AML and for the intent of designing
individualized treatment regimens may not be of great
clinical impact. However, a synergistic role of the
Mdm2SNP309 allele with other prognostic markers is
likely and it may predict for response in patients
receiving p53-directed therapy (e.g. nutlin-3a).

n=91) who developed treatment related AML
following chemo/radiotherapy regimens for another
tumor type did not reveal any significant association
between Mdm2SNP309 and the risk of treatment related
AML [31]. However, an interactive effect between
Mdm2SNP309 and the p53R72P SNP towards increased
risk of AML was observed in patients previously
treated with chemotherapy. Nevertheless, analysis of
data sets from a large group of patients with AML
(n=404 and 816) revealed a modest increase in risk of
de novo AML in patients with an Mdm2SNP309G
background. In agreement with the latter, a study by
Xiong et al., reported a 3.52-fold increase in AML risk
but no association of Mdm2SNP309 with age of onset of
AML in a cohort of 231 patients with AML [32]. A
recent study reported similar results on 575 children
with AML treated on three Children’s Oncology Group
protocols (CCG 2941/2961/AAML 03P1). This study
revealed that patients carrying two copies of the
Mdm2SNP309G allele had an increased susceptibility to
AML [33]. However, unlike CLL [21], Mdm2SNP309
status had no apparent effect on treatment outcome in
AML.
In conclusion, although these studies present
conflicting results, they appear to agree in that the
presence of an Mdm2SNP309G allele correlates with
earlier onset of childhood ALL in an ethnicity and sex
specific manner but may not correlate with incidence
or onset of B-CLL. Additionally, the Mdm2SNP309G/G
genotype increases the risk of de novo AML. The
presence of the Mdm2SNP309G allele either in the
heterozygous or the homozygous state also
significantly impacts the overall survival of patients
with CLL or AML. There are several aspects that
preclude a clear interpretation of results from these
studies. Mdm2SNP309 is a weak modifier of p53 activity
and its effect is influenced by sex, age, gender,
ethnicity and other environmental factors [8].
Furthermore, CLL, ALL and AML are genetically
heterogeneous diseases with varied outcomes in
different individuals depending on factors such as age
at diagnosis, performance status, and the presence of
specific chromosomal abnormalities. Furthermore,
there are multiple SNPs in the p53 pathway that could
alter p53 function. In fact, the polymorphic p53R72P
protein may likewise influence the effect of the
Mdm2SNP309 allele. Some of the above studies have
taken into consideration the potential interplay between
these two SNPs. However, a comprehensive study
validating such interplay is lacking. Additionally,
mutations or defects in p53 or its modulators such as

IMPACT OF THE MDM2SNP309 ALLELE ON
LYMPHOMAGENESIS
A series of small scale retrospective studies have
also been undertaken to address the impact of
Mdm2SNP309G on lymphomagenesis [8, 34-36]. The
initial description of the role that Mdm2SNP309G has on
diffuse large B-cell lymphomagenesis (DLBCL) was
reported by Bond and colleagues [8]. In this study, the
authors demonstrated that women (under the average
age of 51, and therefore considered to be
premenopausal), who self-identified themselves as
being of Ashkenazi Jewish decent, carrying the
Mdm2SNP309G allele were more likely to develop
DLBCL than young women harboring two
Mdm2SNP309T alleles. Specifically, women harboring
two Mdm2SNP309G alleles were diagnosed with DLCBL
13-years earlier than women who carried two
Mdm2SNP309T alleles, with an average age of 55 years
(ranging from 21 to 87 years) and 68 years (ranging
from 55 to 78 years), respectively. In fact, 49% of
women carrying Mdm2SNP309G were diagnosed with
DLBCL before the age of 51. This is in direct contrast
to premenopausal women carrying Mdm2SNP309T/T, as
no individual younger than 51 years of age presented
with DLBCL in this study. It is important to note, that
the significant impact of Mdm2SNP309G on DLBCL
development in women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent
was lost when patients were diagnosed after the age of
51 (considered menopausal). The fact that young
premenopausal women harboring the G nucleotide
were more likely to develop DLBCL led the authors to
speculate that hormone specific factors might influence
this early tumor phenotype. This notion is supported
by several observations. First, women exposed to
exogenous estrogen have an altered risk in DLBCL
development [37]. Secondly, Mdm2 levels are

171

Oncotarget 2010; 1: 168-174

Mdm2SNP309G. The effect of such compounding
polymorphisms on the functionality of Mdm2SNP309G is

regulated by estrogen signaling as the Mdm2 promoter
possesses an estrogen response element (ERE) [38].
Interestingly, this ERE lies in a region just upstream of
the
Mdm2SNP309
polymorphism.
Third,
the
SNP309G
Mdm2
allele results in an increased affinity for
the transcription factor Sp1 [6]. Several studies have
demonstrated that Sp1 activity is further stimulated
upon its interaction with hormone receptors such as the
estrogen receptor [39]. Taken together, these findings
suggest that Mdm2SNP309G may regulate DLBCL
development in a gender-specific mode.
A second report on woman of European Caucasian
descent with DLBCL, suggested the Mdm2SNP309
polymorphism has no impact on age of tumor onset,
even in premenopausal women (under the age 51) [36].
These results are at variance with those reported by
Bond et al, as Bittenbring and colleagues were unable
to detect a significant impact on DLBCL formation in
young women carrying two Mdm2SNP309G alleles. These
differing results highlight the complexity of
determining a functional outcome of an individual SNP
on a specific tumor type, especially a SNP in a
regulatory element such as Mdm2SNP309. In this report,
Bittenbring and colleagues suggest a potential cause for
these discordant observations may be due to ethnicity
differences between the two studies. This is a
potentially plausible explanation as Ashkenazi Jews are
more genetically isolated as compared to individuals
from Europe as a whole. Indeed, while approximately
25% of Ashkenazi Jews harbor two Mdm2SNP309G
alleles only 14% of central European women carried
this allele.
This increased prevalence in the
Mdm2SNP309G in the Ashkenazi Jewish community may
afford an invaluable opportunity to identify individuals
carrying this SNP, and therefore, to ascertain the
impact of such genetic variant in lymphomagenesis.
Additionally, the differing outcome may be a
consequence of a low number of Mdm2SNP309G/G
premenopausal samples used by Bittenbring et al (20
premenopausal female patient samples). This fact
would warrant that a more exhaustive study be
performed. Alternatively and of much more interest,
these different results may suggest that other currently
undescribed genetic modifiers (especially in the p53
pathway) may also influence the functionality of the
Mdm2SNP309G allele; such as the recently identified
SNPs in Mdm4, HAUSP, and/or p53 [40]. This notion
is quite plausible as it has been noted that Ashkenazi
Jews who are isolated genetically, may harbor
additional low penetrant modifiers that could
potentially either detract or augment the function of

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

unknown and may be different in genetically
heterogeneous individuals as compared to more
homogenous populations.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
To

definitely ascertain the impact of the
Mdm2
allele
on
leukemogenesis
and
lymphomagenesis, prospective analyses of large
cohorts of patients are warranted. Given the inherent
biases of all the retrospective studies above-described,
which undoubtedly account for the conflicting results,
the development of animal models carrying the
Mdm2SNP309 allele could certainly be of great interest.
Our laboratory has generated two complementary
humanized Mdm2SNP309 mouse models (Mdm2SNP309G
and Mdm2SNP309T) in order to examine the direct impact
of this SNP on tumor development [41]. Using these
mice we have shown that harboring two Mdm2SNP309G
alleles increases Mdm2 levels and subsequently
decreases p53 as compared to Mdm2SNP309T/T mice.
Furthermore, Mdm2SNP309G/G mice have an attenuated
p53 response following treatment with ionizing
radiation. More importantly, Mdm2SNP309G/G mice
(either carrying a p53 germline mutation or not) rapidly
develop tumors resulting in shorter survival as
compared to Mdm2SNP309T/T mice. Crossing these mice
with the previously reported TCL1 transgenic mouse
[42], an established B-CLL mouse model, or the BCL6
transgenic mouse, an established model that
recapitulated human DLBCL, may provide suitable
model systems to investigate the deregulation of the
p53 pathway induced by the Mdm2SNP309 allele and its
impact on leukemogenesis and lymphomagenesis while
prospective studies in patients with these hematological
malignancies are conducted.
