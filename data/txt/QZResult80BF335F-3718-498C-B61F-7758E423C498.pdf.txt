BACKGROUND: In a placebo-controlled, randomized phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01900743), regorafenib improved
progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with doxorubicin-pretreated advanced nonadipocytic sarcoma. A quality-adjusted time
without symptoms of progression or toxicity (Q-TWiST) post hoc exploratory analysis was applied to provide an integrated measure
of its clinical benefit. METHODS: In the base-case analysis, each patient’s overall survival (OS) was partitioned into 3 mutually exclusive health states: the time with a grade 3 or 4 adverse event (TOX), the time without symptoms of disease or grade 3 or 4 toxicity
from treatment, and the time after tumor progression or relapse. The time spent in each state was weighted with a health-state utility
associated with that state and was summed to calculate the Q-TWiST. The stability of the base-case analysis was explored with several sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In nonadipocytic sarcoma, the PFS was (4.0 months [2.6-5.5 months] with regorafenib vs 1.0 month
[0.9-1.8 months] with a placebo; hazard ratio, 0.36 [0.25-0.53]; P < .0001); the OS was 13.4 months (8.6-17.3 months) with regorafenib
and 9.0 months (6.8-12.5 months) with a placebo (hazard ratio, 0.67 [0.44-1.02]). With the classic definition of TOX (including all
grade 3 and 4 clinical adverse events), the Q-TWiSTs were 8.0 months (7.0-9.0 months) with regorafenib and 5.7 months (4.9-6.4
months) with a placebo (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with doxorubicin-pretreated soft-tissue sarcoma, regorafenib signifiC 2017 The Authors. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) accounts for approximately 2% of all adult cancers.1 Approximately 5% of patients with STS
present with metastases at diagnosis. Moreover, in cases of localized STS, despite large en bloc resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, a rate of relapse with metastases of approximately 40% is seen. At an advanced stage when it is not amenable to curative-intent surgery, STS remains a difficult disease to treat. The recommended first-line treatment for

advanced STS in 2016 is still doxorubicin or doxorubicin
and ifosfamide–based chemotherapy,2 which provides an
overall survival (OS) of approximately 18 months.3 In the
case of progression or intolerance of these major drugs,
there are different approved options, including dacarbazine,4 trabectedin, and pazopanib.2 Doxorubicinrefractory metastatic STS remains an unmet need. We
have conducted an international, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial assessing the activity and safety of regorafenib in doxorubicin-refractory
metastatic STS. Regorafenib significantly improved
progression-free survival (PFS) in 3 of the 4 cohorts: leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and other nonadipocytic
sarcomas. Regorafenib did not meet the primary objective
for liposarcoma patients.5
The primary aims of palliative systemic treatment in
this setting are as follows: 1) to alleviate symptoms related
to disease progression; 2) to slow down the tumor growth;
3) to maintain or, if possible, improve the quality of life;
and 4) to prolong OS with dignity and without major toxicity. However, data supporting the clinical benefit of palliative systemic treatment in advanced STS are sparse.68
In the current study, we analyzed the impact of regorafenib on quality of life with a modeling approach based on
the quality-adjusted time without symptoms of progression or toxicity (Q-TWiST).9,10 This method takes into
account the OS, PFS, and time without intolerable toxicity (among grade 3/4 toxicities) caused by treatment in 2
arms (here regorafenib and placebo arms). At the end, this
approach estimates a weighted sum of time spent without
treatment-related toxicity and without disease progression.
However, because the definition of an intolerable toxicity
is highly subjective, we interviewed 60 proxy patients to
set up the threshold defining such toxicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
REGOSARC Study

REGOrafenib in SARComa (REGOSARC) was an
international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial assessing the activity and safety of
regorafenib in 4 cohorts of patients: liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and other nonadipocytic
sarcomas.5 The stratification factors at randomization
were the country (Austria vs France) and prior exposure
to pazopanib. In both arms, treatment was administered
until 1 of the following events occurred: confirmed progressive disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.1),
unmanageable or unacceptable toxicity, a treatment

delay of more than 21 days for any reason, concurrent
serious illness, or a patient’s refusal of treatment or an
investigator’s decision to stop it. Patients allocated to the
placebo could receive regorafenib upon documented
progression (crossover). The tumor assessment was performed at the baseline, every month during the first 3
months, and every 3 months after that. A blinded, central radiological review was conducted to reduce the bias.
The primary endpoint was PFS according to RECIST
(version 1.1) and after a blinded, central radiological
reading. The study was approved by ethical and regulatory committees: the French ethics committee (French
North-West IV Ethics committee; date of approval,
March 21, 2013), the Austrian ethics committee (Ethics
committee of Vienna Medical University; No. 1376/
2013], and the French and Austrian drug agencies
(French Drug Agency; date of approval, March 8, 2013).
All study procedures were conducted in accordance with
the Harmonised Tripartite Guideline on Good Clinical
Practice of the International Conference on Harmonisation. Signed informed consent was obtained from all
study participants before registration. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01900743).5
Q-TWiST: Base-Case Analysis

The base-case analysis was a post hoc analysis of REGOSARC trial data using the classic definition of unacceptable toxicity. After the randomization, the toxicity state
or TOX was defined as the time spent with Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or 4
adverse events (AEs) before disease progression. In the
current analysis, we have taken into account related and
unrelated toxicity. The time spent with AEs was summed
for each patient, and a day with multiple events was
counted only once. TOX was determined as the time
spent with clinical AEs before crossover, regardless of
when the events occurred (biological AEs without clinical signs were excluded from the definition of TOX).
However, any AEs that occurred after disease progression
were excluded from the analysis. REL represents the time
spent without disease progression according to RECIST
(version 1.1) or death. TWiST represents the time spent
without toxicity or disease progression (see Fig. 1A). The
product-limit method was used to estimate the mean
amount of time in the following states: time with any
toxicity after randomization but before progression (ie,
TOX), time from randomization to progression or death
(ie, PFS), and time from randomization until death from
any cause (ie, OS). Survival curves that corresponded to
TOX, PFS, and OS were plotted on the same graph for

Figure 1. (A) Q-TWiST: base-case analysis of a placebo versus regorafenib. These graphs express the mean survival over time.
The upper survival curves represent overall survival. The middle survival curves represent progression-free survival. The lower survival curves represent survival without unacceptable treatment-related toxicity. Between the overall survival curves and the
progression-free survival curves, the black represents the mean time spent between documented disease progression and death.
Between the progression-free survival curves and the curves of survival without unacceptable treatment-related toxicity, the dark
gray represents the Q-TWiST. The light gray represents the mean time with unacceptable toxicity. (B) Threshold utility analysis.
This graph depicts a utility analysis in which the utility of disease progression and the utility of treatment-related toxicity vary
from 0 to 1. The time horizon has been set at 15.5 months, and the utility of toxicity is constant (ie, 1). The horizontal axis represents the different values of disease progression from 0 to 1. The vertical axis represents the different values of treatment-related
toxicity. The dark gray represents a scenario in which regorafenib is superior to the placebo. On the contrary, the light gray represents a different scenario in which there is no significant difference between the placebo and regorafenib. There is no scenario in
which the placebo is superior to regorafenib. (C) Difference in Q-TWiST between the 2 treatment groups according to the time
from randomization. This graph shows the difference in Q-TWiST between the 2 arms over time and its 95% confidence interval.
The horizontal axis represents the time spent from the date of randomization. The vertical axis represents the difference in QTWiST between the 2 arms. This difference constantly increases over time, and this demonstrates that the gain in Q-TWiST constantly increases with exposure to regorafenib. Q-TWiST indicates quality-adjusted time without symptoms of progression or toxicity; REL, time spent without disease progression; TOX, time with a grade 3 or 4 adverse event; TWiST, time spent without
toxicity or disease progression.

each treatment group. The areas between the curves represent the restricted mean durations of TWiST and REL
as follows:
Duration of TWiST5Mean PFS
2Mean time with toxicities
Duration of REL 5 Mean OS – Mean PFS
Q-TWiST analysis uses these different periods of
times, which are weighted by specific utilities. The mean
Q-TWiST for each treatment arm was calculated with the
following formula:
Q2TWiST 5 ðuTOX 3 TOXÞ
1 ðuTWiST 3 TWiSTÞ 1 ðuREL 3 RELÞ
where uREL is the utility for the period without disease
progression and is set to 0.5, uTOX is the utility for the
period of symptoms and is set to 0.5, and uTWIST is the
utility for the period without relapse and toxicity and is
set to 1. Differences between treatment groups (regorafenib vs placebo) in the mean Q-TWiST were calculated.
Bootstrapping with 1000 iterations was performed to
ensure accurate estimates of Q-TWiST. The areas under
the Q-TWiST curves in both arms were measured and
then compared.9,10
We conducted 2 classic sensitivity analyses. The
threshold sensitivity analysis explored different scenarios
in which the utility of disease progression and the utility
of treatment-related toxicity varied from 0 to 1 (see Fig.
1B). The difference in Q-TWiST between the 2 arms was
measured over the time from the date of randomization
(so-called gain-of-function analysis; see Fig. 1C).9,10
Definition of Intolerable Toxicity

In the base-case analysis and previously published analyses, the definition of TOX (ie, the time spent with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or
4 AEs before disease progression) was arbitrary. It is
likely that AEs differed in their impact on quality of life;
patients’ points of view were necessary to weigh these
AEs. As a result, we interviewed 2 groups of patients, not
included in the trial, to define an intolerable toxicity.
Interviewing patients enrolled in the REGOSARC trial
was not part of the study protocol, so we had to interview
proxy patients. The first group of patients (the tyrosine
kinase inhibitor [TKI] group) consisted of patients treated
with a TKI, whatever the primary tumor was. The second
group of patients (the STS group) consisted of STS
patients receiving systemic treatment (mainly

chemotherapy for metastatic disease). Patients assessed
the tolerability of the main toxicities of regorafenib (alopecia, anorexia, asthenia, diarrhea, arterial hypertension,
mucositis, and hand-foot skin reactions) according to the
grade (grades 2 and 3) and according to the duration of
the toxicity. For each scenario, we used the event/grade/
duration on a Likert-scale hetero-questionnaire with 4 values: acceptable, slightly unacceptable, unacceptable, and
totally unacceptable. Every patient was interviewed by the
same investigator (V.B.). The validity (reliability) of the
questionnaire was assessed with Cronbach’s a coefficient
(good reliability was defined as a > .7). Comparisons of
the points of view of the 2 groups (the STS and TKI
groups) were analyzed with a principal component
analysis.
Q-TWiST: Sensitivity Analysis Taking Into
Account the Patients’ Point of View

On the basis of the analysis of the hetero-questionnaires, 6
alternative definitions of intolerable toxicity were used: 1)
every toxicity regarded as at least slightly unacceptable by
at least 20% of interviewed patients, 2) every toxicity
regarded as at least slightly unacceptable by at least 33%
of interviewed patients, 3) every toxicity regarded as at
least slightly unacceptable by at least 50% of interviewed
patients, 4) every toxicity regarded as unacceptable or
totally unacceptable by at least 20% of interviewed
patients, 5) every toxicity regarded as unacceptable or
totally unacceptable by at least 33% of interviewed
patients, and 6) every toxicity regarded as unacceptable or
totally unacceptable by at least 50% of interviewed
patients. Q-TWiST was then recalculated with these 6
alternative definitions of TOX. In comparison with the
base-case analysis, the definitions of REL, TWiST, and
utilities remained unchanged.
RESULTS
Definition of Intolerable Toxicity According
to Interviewed Patients

From February 2015 to December 2015, 67 eligible
patients were invited to participate; 7 patients refused.
Thirty STS patients and 30 TKI patients were interviewed. The sex ratio was 2/1, and the mean age was
61 6 12 years. Most of the TKI patients were treated
with sunitinib (22 of 30).
The validity of the questionnaire was very good for
the following toxicities (Cronbach’s a coefficient > .7):
anorexia (.92), asthenia (.87), diarrhea (0.92), arterial
hypertension (.86), mucositis (.88), and hand-foot skin
reactions (.87). The validity was insufficient for alopecia

the assessments of toxicity tolerability were similar in the
2 groups of interviewed patients (data not shown). Table
1 summarizes the patients’ point of view.
REGOSARC Trial Results

The primary analysis of this trial has already been reported
elsewhere. Briefly, from August 2013 to November 2014,
182 patients were randomized across the 4 cohorts and
included in the final intent-to-treat analysis. At the cutoff
date (January 7, 2016), the number of required events was
reached for the 4 cohorts. The trial did not meet the primary endpoint of superiority for liposarcoma patients. In
nonadipocytic patients, regorafenib was associated with a
statistically and clinically significant improvement in PFS
(4.0 months [2.6-5.5 months] with regorafenib vs 1.0
month [0.9-1.8 months] with a placebo; hazard ratio,
0.36 [0.25-0.53]; P < .0001). A trend toward an improvement in OS was observed despite the high number
of patients who switched to regorafenib in the placebo
arm (13.4 months [8.6-17.3 months] with regorafenib vs
9.0 months [6.8-12.5 months] with a placebo; hazard
ratio, 0.67 [0.44-1.01]; P 5 .06).
Before crossover, the most common clinically significant grade 3 or higher AEs were arterial hypertension
(18% in the regorafenib arm vs 2% in the placebo arm),
hand-foot skin reactions (15% vs 0%), asthenia (13% vs
7%), diarrhea (4% vs 2%), mucositis (4% vs 0%), and
anorexia (3% vs 4%). Table 1 suggests larger differences
in TOX between the placebo and regorafenib arms for
toxicities deemed to be intolerable by a larger proportion
of patients.
2298

Q-TWiST: Base-Case Analysis

The Q-TWiST is illustrated in Figure 1A. The TWiST
was 2.01 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.432.58 months) and 4.80 months (95% CI, 3.77-6.00
months) in the placebo and regorafenib arms, respectively. The TOX was 0.22 months (95% CI, 0.11-0.33
months) and 1.14 months (95% CI, 0.49-1.78 months)
in the placebo and regorafenib arms, respectively. The QTWiST was 5.68 months (95% CI, 4.92-6.45 months)
and 7.97 months (95% CI, 6.96-8.97 months) in the placebo and regorafenib arms, respectively (Table 1). The
difference was significant (P < .0001) with an absolute
Q-TWiST gain of 2.28 months (95% CI, 1.02-3.55).
The threshold utility analysis showed that most of the utility values were associated with a significant improvement
in Q-TWiST with regorafenib (Fig. 1B). The Q-TWiST
gain of function according to time showed that the benefit
constantly increased with the duration of treatment
(Fig. 1C).
Sensitivity Analysis Taking Into Account
the Point of View of Interviewed Patients

Table 2 summarizes these analyses. Whatever the threshold defining TOX was, regorafenib was always associated
with a significant improvement in Q-TWiST.
DISCUSSION
The current study shows that the 2 groups of interviewed
patients similarly assessed the tolerability of 6 major AEs.
Whatever threshold was used for defining intolerable toxicity, in comparison with a placebo, regorafenib significantly improved the Q-TWiST by approximately 1.6
months. Despite the poor outcomes associated with

doxorubicin-refractory advanced STS and the occurrence
of AEs related to regorafenib, this Q-TWiST benefit
appears statistically and clinically significant.
In the palliative-care setting, the integration of quality of life into decision making and drug development is
critical. Symptom burden is a major issue for patients
with advanced sarcoma. Gough et al8 retrospectively
assessed the symptom burden in 81 patients with
advanced sarcoma; the median number of symptoms was
2 (range, 0-5) before first-line chemotherapy (n 5 50)
and 3 (range, 1-6) at the time of the exclusive palliative2300

care decision (n 5 48). The commonest symptoms were
pain and dyspnea. This justifies early supportive/palliative-care interventions. The data assessing the quality of
life of patients with advanced STS are sparse.5-8,11 The
evidence demonstrating that systemic treatment decreases
the symptom burden in patients with advanced sarcoma is
missing. In the Pazopanib Explored in Soft Tissue Sarcoma (PALETTE) trial (pazopanib vs placebo), quality of
life was assessed with a validated health-related self-questionnaire such as the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core
30.7,11 In general, the health-related quality of life

declined over time over a similar range in both arms.
Pazopanib was associated with a significant detrimental
impact on the quality of life because of diarrhea, anorexia,
nausea/vomiting, and asthenia.7,11 Pazopanib treatment
did not significantly reduce the symptom burden. In the
current study, we used an alternative approach, that is, the
Q-TWiST methodology, to examine all dimensions: OS,
PFS, and time without symptoms. Whatever method is
used, we think that an assessment of the quality of life is
necessary when the activity/safety of new options is being
evaluated in the palliative setting.
To our knowledge, there was no prior study of STS
patients and patients receiving regorafenib using QTWiST analysis. Q-TWiST analysis remains rarely used.
This approach was initially used for patients with breast
cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Q-TWiST has
been more recently used in the metastatic setting of different advanced solid tumors. We found 2 articles assessing
Q-TWiST in renal cell carcinoma patients receiving oral
TKIs. Patil et al9 compared Q-TWiSTs for patients receiving sunitinib and patients receiving interferon-a. TOX was
defined as every clinically significant grade 3 AE. Sunitinib
was associated with a longer Q-TWiST (5.8 vs 1.8
months), mainly because of significant improvements in
PFS (16 months). Beaumont et al10 compared the clinical
benefits of pazopanib and sunitinib. TOX was defined as
every grade 3 AE in their first approach and as every grade
2 AE in their second approach. There was no significant
difference in Q-TWiSTs with either of the approaches
because PFS was similar in the 2 arms, but pazopanib was
associated with a higher rate of AEs.
In the current study, we explored the impact of different definitions of TOX in a Q-TWiST analysis. We
used classic values of utilities (uTWiST 5 1, uTOX
0.5, and uREL 5 0.5). These values are largely used in
the literature, and we conducted sensitivity analyses demonstrating the stability of the results (Fig. 1B). The choice
of utility values has already been explored in prior studies.
Guest et al12 proposed different values of utilities: 0.30 in
the case of disease progression, 0.43 in the case of stable
disease, 0.51 in the case of a partial response, and 0.60 in
the case of a complete response after palliative chemotherapy. However, that study did not take into account toxicity. Shingler et al13 proposed different utilities in the case
of stable disease: 0.74 in the absence of toxicity, 0.50 in
the case of pain, 0.49 in the case of dyspnea, 0.47 in the
case of asthenia, 0.41 in the case of diarrhea, and 0.38 in
the case of nausea/vomiting. In these 2 last studies, utilities were defined after interviews of subjects from the general population and not cancer patients. Reichardt et al6

defined some utilities in STS and osseous sarcoma
patients experiencing stable disease during first-line treatment (u 0.72) where u is utility, stable disease during
second-line treatment (u 5 0.64), stable disease during
third-line treatment (u 5 0.77), stable disease during a
drug holiday (u 5 0.77), and disease progression
(u 5 0.56). In this last study, toxicity utilities were not
explored.
The current study has some limitations. First, we
were not able to interview patients enrolled in the REGOSARC trial because this study was an international multicenter study with 30 enrolling sites. The current study
required standardization and harmonization of patients’
interviews; every patient had to be interviewed by the same
investigator. As a result, we enrolled proxy patients affected
by advanced STS or being treated with TKIs. The principal
component analysis showed the convergence of the points
of view of both groups of patients. Second, we focused the
hetero-questionnaire on 6 clinically relevant major AEs,
and we did not integrate other AEs, such as myalgia, voice
changes, or dyspnea. As a result, we might hypothesize that
Q-TWiST was slightly overestimated because the list of
AEs entered into the model was not exhaustive. Some autoquestionnaires such as the patient-reported outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events could be useful for better and more objectively
defining intolerable toxicity from the patients’ perspective.
In the end, the presented results support the conclusion that compared with a placebo, regorafenib offers
improved clinical and quality-of-life outcomes for patients
with advanced/metastatic STS.
FUNDING SUPPORT
The REGOSARC trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01900743)
was fully funded by Bayer HealthCare SA; however, the current study
was conducted by the study coordinators (Nicolas Penel and Thomas
Brodowicz), their sponsor (the Oscar Lambret Cancer Center), and
their statisticians. Bayer HealthCare SA had no role in the collection,
analysis, or interpretation of data. The corresponding author had full
access to all of the data and the final responsibility for submitting the
manuscript for publication.
