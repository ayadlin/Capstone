Abstract
Diphenyl difluoroketone (EF24), a molecule having structural
similarity to curcumin, was reported to inhibit proliferation of
a variety of cancer cells in vitro. However, the efficacy and
in vivo mechanism of action of EF24 in gastrointestinal cancer
cells have not been investigated. Here, we assessed the in vivo
therapeutic effects of EF24 on colon cancer cells. Using
hexosaminidase assay, we determined that EF24 inhibits
proliferation of HCT-116 and HT-29 colon and AGS gastric
adenocarcinoma cells but not of mouse embryo fibroblasts.
Furthermore, the cancer cells showed increased levels of
activated caspase-3 and increased Bax to Bcl-2 and Bax to
Bcl-xL ratios, suggesting that the cells were undergoing
apoptosis. At the same time, cell cycle analysis showed that
there was an increased number of cells in the G2-M phase. To
determine the effects of EF24 in vivo, HCT-116 colon cancer
xenografts were established in nude mice and EF24 was given
i.p. EF24 significantly suppressed the growth of colon cancer
tumor xenografts. Immunostaining for CD31 showed that there
was a lower number of microvessels in the EF24-treated
animals coupled with decreased cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin8, and vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA and protein
expression. Western blot analyses also showed decreased
AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in
the tumors. Taken together, these data suggest that the novel
curcumin-related compound EF24 is a potent antitumor agent
that induces caspase-mediated apoptosis during mitosis and
has significant therapeutic potential for gastrointestinal
cancers. [Cancer Res 2008;68(6):1962–9]

Introduction
Colorectal carcinoma is the second leading cause of cancer
mortality in the United States with f55,000 deaths in 2006 (1–3).
Because conventional therapies, including surgical rejection,
chemotherapy, and radiation, are often inadequate at treating
the disease, the need for new treatment options has grown more
critical. Epidemiologic studies suggest that diet plays a major
role in the prevention of many cancers, and curcumin (a common

flavoring agent in the spice turmeric) may be a dietary component
responsible for lower rates of colorectal cancer in certain part
of India (4). Curcumin has also been used in Indian folk medicine
to treat several ailments, and recent preclinical and clinical studies
show that curcumin has several anticancer and antiangiogenic
properties (5, 6). Its antitumor properties include cancer growth
inhibition and apoptosis induction in a variety of cultured cancer
cell lines in vitro. Additionally, curcumin has shown the ability to
inhibit tumorigenesis in vivo (7–13). The use of curcumin in
antiangiogenesis includes the inhibition of vascular endothelial
cell proliferation in vitro and capillary tube formation and growth
in vivo (14, 15). The published report and our previous studies
showed that curcumin inhibits epidermal growth factor (EGF)mediated signaling and growth of intestinal adenomas in APCmin/+
mice (16). However, due to the low cancer-killing potency and poor
intestinal absorption characteristics of curcumin (17, 18), bioavailability of the compound has limited its use. Consequently,
analogues of curcumin with similar safety profiles but increased
anticancer activity and solubility have recently been developed
(13, 14, 19). One compound in particular, diphenyl difluoroketone
(EF24), is active in anticancer screens and has considerably less
toxic effect than the commonly used chemotherapeutic drug
cisplatin (17, 20). In this article, we show results of our in vitro
experiments showing that EF24 inhibits cell proliferation, prevents
colony formation, and promotes G2-M arrest of colon and gastric
cancer cells. Our in vivo studies with HCT-116 colon cancer cell
tumor xenografts in nude mice revealed that EF24 suppresses
cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis and induces cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis, coupled with the reduction of the expression
of colon cancer–promoting genes, including cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF).

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents. HCT-116, HT-29 colon, and AGS gastric adenocarcinoma cells (all from American Type Culture Collection) were grown in
DMEM and RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Sigma Chemical Co.) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution
(Mediatech, Inc.) at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Curcumin
was purchased from LKT Laboratories. EF24 was synthesized at the
Institute of Organic and Medicinal Chemistry, University of Pecs (Pecs,
Hungary).
Proliferation and apoptosis assays. To assess proliferation, cells were
seeded onto 96-well plates at a density of 1  103 per well and allowed to
adhere and grow overnight in 10% heat-inactivated FBS containing DMEM
or RPMI 1640. The cells were then treated with increasing doses of EF24 in
10% FBS containing DMEM or RPMI 1640. Analysis of cell proliferation was
performed by enzymatic assay as described above (21). For apoptosis,

EF24 and Anticancer Cancer Activity
caspase-3/7 activity was measured using the Apo-ONE Homogeneous
Caspase-3/7 Assay kit (Promega). Both floating and attached cells were
included in these analyses.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were plated at a density of 5  105 per well on
six-well plates. After treatment with EF24 for the indicated period, both
floating and attached cells were collected into flow cytometry tubes and
centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min to obtain cell pellets. The supernatant
was discarded, and the cells were washed with PBS and then recentrifuged.
The cells were resuspended in 100 AL PBS, 3 mL of 20jC ice-cold 70%
ethanol were added, and the cells were then incubated for 1 h at 4jC. The
cells were washed twice with PBS and 10 mg/mL RNase A was added.
Propidium iodide was added to the tubes at a final concentration of
0.05 mg/mL and incubated at 4jC for 30 min in the dark. Cell cycle analysis
was performed with a Becton Dickinson FACScan using an FL2 detector
with a bandpass filter at specifications of 585 F 21 nm. In each analysis,
10,000 events were recorded. Results were analyzed with ModFit LT software
(Verity Software House).
Colony formation assay. Briefly, six-well dishes were seeded with
500 viable cells in complete medium and allowed to grow for 24 h. The cells
were then incubated in the presence or absence of various concentrations
of EF24 for up to 48 h. The EF24-containing medium was then removed,
and the cells were washed in PBS and incubated for an additional 10 days in
complete medium. Each treatment was done in triplicate. The colonies
obtained were washed with PBS and fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min
at room temperature and then washed with PBS followed by staining with
hematoxylin. The colonies were counted and compared with untreated cells.
HCT-116 cell tumor xenograft in mice. Five-week-old male athymic
nude mice purchased from The Jackson Laboratory were used for in vivo
experiments; they were maintained with water and standard mouse chow
ad libitum and used in protocols approved by the University’s Animal
Studies Committee. Animals were injected with 1  106 HCT-116 cells in the
left and right flank and allowed to form xenograft. EF24 (200 Ag/kg body
weight) in 5% Na2HCO3 buffer alone was given i.p. daily for 23 days. Tumor
size was measured weekly. At the end of treatment, the animals were
sacrificed, and the tumors were removed and weighed for use in histology
(H&E, COX-2, VEGF, and CD31) and gene expression studies.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Total RNA isolated
from HCT-116 cells and tumor xenograft using Trizol reagent was reverse
transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase in the presence of
random hexanucleotide primers (all from Invitrogen). Complementary
DNAs were then used for real-time PCR using JumpStart Taq DNA
polymerase (Sigma Chemical) and SYBR Green nucleic acid stain (Molecular
Probes). Crossing threshold values for individual genes were normalized to
h2 microglobulin. Changes in mRNA expression were expressed as fold
change relative to control. Primers used in this study were as follows:
h2 microglobulin, 5¶-GAGTGCTGTCTCCATGTTTGATG-3¶ and 5¶-CTCTAAGTTGCCAGCCCTCCT-3¶; IL-8, 5¶-CTCTTGGCAGCCTTCCTGATT-3¶ and
5¶-TATGCACTGACATCTAAGTTCCTTTAGCA-3¶; COX-2, 5¶-GAATCATTCACCAGGCAAATTG-3¶ and 5¶-TCTGTACTGCGGGTGGAACA-3¶; and VEGF,
5¶-AGCGCAAGAAATCCCGGTA-3¶ and 5¶-TGCTTTCTCCGCTCTGAGC-3¶.
Western blot analysis. Cell lysates were subjected to PAGE and blotted
onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., and specific proteins were detected by the enhanced
chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
IL-8 ELISA. The HCT-116 cells were treated with EF24 for 24 h. The
cell-free supernatants and tumor xenograft proteins were measured by
IL-8 using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Pierce Biotechnology) using the
manufacturer’s suggested protocol.
Immunohistochemistry. Tissues embedded in paraffin were cut to a
section of 4 Am, deparaffinized, and treated with citrate buffer. Then, they
were blocked with avidin/biotin for 20 min. The slides were incubated with
anti–COX-2 or VEGF or CD31 for overnight at 4jC. Subsequently, the slides
were treated with secondary antibody with horseradish peroxidase goat
anti-rabbit for COX-2 or VEGF and goat anti-rat for CD31 staining for
1 h and developed with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich). Finally, the
slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.

Results
EF24 inhibits intestinal cancer cell proliferation. We first
determined the effect of EF24 and curcumin on cell proliferation in
a variety of cultured cancer cell lines (Fig. 1A). EF24 significantly
suppresses proliferation of colon cancer cell lines HCT-116 and
HT-29 and a gastric cancer cell line (AGS) within a 24-h period,
which continues to 72 h (Fig. 1B). More importantly, the effects
were observed at a dose of 1 Amol/L, a dose at which curcumin had
no significant effect on HCT-116 cell proliferation. Similar results
were observed with esophageal, lung, breast, pancreatic, and
cervical cancer cells (data not shown). In contrast, EF24 did not
affect the proliferation of normal mouse embryonic fibroblasts cells
treated with 5 Amol/L concentration, whereas hydrogen peroxide
significantly affected it (Fig. 1C), suggesting that EF24 is not toxic
to normal cells. To determine the long-term effect of EF24 treatment, cells were treated with 1 Amol/L EF24 for 24 h, following
which the cells were allowed to grow in normal medium. EF24
treatment suppresses colony formation in a dose-dependent manner in all three cell lines (Fig. 1D), suggesting that EF24 effects
on the cells are irreversible. Again, at this 1 Amol/L dose, curcumin
did not affect cell growth and colony formation (Fig. 1D).
EF24 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. At a sufficiently
high dose, curcumin is known to induce apoptosis of cancer cells.
Cell cycle analysis was performed to determine the mechanism by
which EF24 affects cancer cells. EF24 (1 Amol/L) induced growth
arrest of the HT-29 and AGS cells within 24 h at the G2-M stage and
subsequently at the G0 hypodiploid/fragmented DNA stage at
48 hours (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S1). Similar results were
observed in HCT-116 cells (data not shown). These data suggest
that the cells were undergoing apoptosis. Caspase-3 is a key
effector molecule in the apoptosis pathway involved in amplifying
the signal from initiator caspases, such as caspase-8 (22, 23).
Increased activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 was observed
within 24 h in HCT-116 and AGS cells treated with either 1 or
5 Amol/L of EF24 (Fig. 2B). However, whereas 1 Amol/L EF24 did
not induced caspase-3 and caspase-7 activity in HT-29 cells at
24 hours, 5 Amol/L EF24 did (Fig. 2B). These data further show that
EF24 was inducing apoptosis (Fig. 2B). Western blot analyses of
HCT-116 cell lysates showed a significant increase in the activated
caspase-3 in cells treated with 5 Amol/L EF24 (Fig. 2C). In addition, 5 Amol/L EF24 inhibited the expression of antiapoptotic
genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein but it had no detectable effect
on the expression levels of apoptosis-promoting total Bax protein
(Fig. 2D). This resulted in decreased Bcl-2 to Bax and Bcl-xL to Bax
protein ratios (Supplementary Fig. S2). These data suggest that
EF24 is a potent inducer of apoptosis even at low doses where no
such effect is observed with curcumin.
EF24 inhibits tumor growth. To evaluate the role of EF24 in
tumor proliferation in vivo, we examined the ability of EF24 to
suppress the growth of human cancer cell xenografts in nude mice.
Colon cancer cell–induced xenograft tumors were allowed to
develop and grow to a size of 500 mm3, following which EF24 was
given i.p. for 3 weeks daily. EF24 significantly inhibits the growth of
the tumor xenografts (Fig. 3A). The excised tumors from the EF24treated animals ranged from 200 to 300 mg, whereas those from
the control group weighed <120 mg (Fig. 3B and C). In addition,
tumor volumes were significantly decreased (Fig. 3D). Whereas the

inhibits proliferation of HCT-116, HT-29, and AGS cells. These cells were incubated with increasing doses of EF24 (0.01–10 Amol/L) for 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods
and analyzed for cell proliferation using hexosaminidase enzyme activity. EF24 treatment resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease in cell number in all
three cells when compared with untreated controls and curcumin. C, EF24 does not affect the proliferation of normal mouse embryonic fibroblast cells treated
with 5 Amol/L EF24 for 48 h using hexosaminidase enzyme activity. D, EF24 inhibits cell growth as indicated by colony formation assays using HCT-116, HT-29,
and AGS cells. These cells were incubated with 1 Amol/L EF24 or curcumin for 24 h and subsequently allowed to grow into colonies. As indicated by counts performed
10 d after incubation, EF24, but not curcumin, inhibits colony-forming units. Results are representative of three independent experiments.

control tumors continue to grow during the treatment period
reaching a size of 2,000 mm3, tumors in the EF24-treated animals
did not grow. No apparent toxicity effects were observed in the
EF24-treated animals (data not shown). Furthermore, tumors
began to regress in the EF24-treated animals that were allowed to
continue living past the 21-day period (data not shown). In our
tests, no control animals were allowed to remain alive after 21 days.
To evaluate whether EF24 administration affects normal physiology, we treated non–tumor-bearing mice weekly at exactly the
same 200 Ag/kg body weight dose for 3 weeks. There was no
apparent change in liver weight, spleen weight, or body weight in
the animals (data not shown). These data imply that EF24 is a
potential therapeutic for treatment of colon cancers and that it is
relatively nontoxic to mice.
EF24 inhibits the signaling of tumor cell survival. Survival
signals that originate from extracellular cues result in the
activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT
and/or the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. The PI3K pathway plays a

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (6). March 15, 2008

crucial role in the survival of various cell types (24). Activated AKT
phosphorylates numerous proteins that have been implicated in the
control of the cell cycle to ultimately stimulate cell growth and
inhibit apoptosis (25). Western blot analyses of HCT-116 cell lysates
showed a significant dose- and time-dependent decrease in the
EGF-mediated AKT phosphorylation in cells treated with EF24
(Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S3). MAPKs are also activated by a
range of extracellular signals via protein phosphorylation cascades
that relay mitogenic signals to the nucleus, thereby modulating the
activity of transcription factors (26–29). The two best-characterized
isoforms [p42mapk (ERK-2) and p44mapk (ERK-1)] are directly
activated by phosphorylation on specific tyrosine and threonine
residues by the dual-specificity ERK kinase. Western blot analyses of
HCT-116 cell lysates showed a significant dose-dependent decrease
in the EGF-mediated ERK phosphorylation in cells treated with
EF24 (Fig. 4B). In addition, EF24 significantly inhibited the tumor
xenograft AKT and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4C and D). These
data suggest that EF24 is a potent inhibitor of tumor cell survival
through suppression of PI3K and ERK-MAPK pathways.

EF24 and Anticancer Cancer Activity

EF24 inhibits expression of cancer-promoting genes and
angiogenesis. COX-2, a key rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin
production, is overexpressed at multiple stages of colon carcinogenesis (30–32). Knockdown of COX-2 activity by either nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs or by deletion of the COX-2 gene results in
the suppression of intestinal polyposis in APCmin/+ mice (30–32). Previous studies have shown increased levels of COX-2 mRNA in colorectal adenomas, adenocarcinomas, and colon cancer cell lines

(33, 34). Therefore, we next determined the effects of EF24 treatment on COX-2 expression. EF24 treatment reduced COX-2 mRNA
and protein levels in HCT-116 cells (Fig. 5A and B). Interestingly,
protein levels of both COX-2 and VEGF were rapidly reduced within 2
hour of treatment with EF24, suggesting the presence of posttranslational control mechanisms in regulating expression of these genes.
COX-2 expression was significantly lower in EF24-treated nude
mice tumor xenografts when compared with the control tumors

Figure 2. EF24 induces cancer cell apoptosis. A, DNA content (propidium iodide) and cell cycle analysis of EF24-treated cells. HT-29 cells were treated with
EF24 for 24 and 48 h. M1, sub-G1-G0 peak; M2, G1 phase; M3, S phase; M4, G2-M phase. Apoptosis was measured as the percentage of cells containing hypodiploid
amounts of DNA (sub-G1-G0 peak). EF24 treatment leads to increased number of cells in the G2-M phase after 24 h as indicated by the increase in M4 peaks
compared with control. Increase in M1 peaks at 48 h indicates that EF24 induces apoptosis after 48 h. Graphs are representative of data collected from at least
three experiments. B, EF24 treatment induces apoptosis in HCT-116, HT-29, and AGS cells. HCT-116, HT-29, and AGS cells incubated with 1 Amol/L (top ) and
5 Amol/L (bottom ) of EF24 were analyzed for apoptosis. EF24 treatment increased number of apoptotic cells compared with either curcumin-treated or untreated
control. *, P < 0.001. C, EF24 induces caspase-3, an apoptosis mediator. Lysates from HCT-116 cells incubated with 5 Amol/L EF24 were analyzed by Western blotting
for caspase-3 protein expression levels using rabbit anti–caspase-3 antibody. EF24-treated cells show cleaved (activated) caspase-3, whereas untreated cells have no
cleaved caspase-3. D, EF24 reduces expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in treated cells when compared with untreated cells. Lysates from HCT-116
cells incubated with 5 Amol/L EF24 were analyzed by Western blotting for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax protein expression levels. Whereas both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were
reduced, Bax expression was not affected by EF24 treatment.

xenograft growth in vivo. A and B, HCT-116

i.p. for up to 21 d. On day 22, tumors were
excised and subjected to further analyses.
Tumor volumes in EF24 given mice were

(Fig. 6A and C). Immunohistochemistry showed a diffused cytoplasmic staining for COX-2 in the epithelial cells in the control
tumors, and the expression was higher subepithelial myofibroblasts (Fig. 6D). However, COX-2 staining was significantly reduced
in both the epithelial cells and myofibroblasts in EF24-treated
tumors.
VEGF and IL-8 are potent inducers of capillary growth into the
tumor, and without angiogenesis, tumor growth normally stops at a
diameter of about 1 to 2 mm. Prostaglandins and the other tumorpromoting mediators are known to induce the expression of VEGF
and IL-8 in epithelial cells. Hence, we also determined the effect of
EF24 on expression of these two genes in colon cancer cells. Both
VEGF and IL-8 expression were significantly reduced in HCT-116
cells (Fig. 5A–C). Similarly, VEGF and IL-8 levels were significantly
reduced in the EF24-treated tumor xenografts (Fig. 6A–C). We also
determined the effect of EF24 on tumor vascularization by staining
for the endothelial-specific antigen CD31. As shown in Fig. 6D,
EF24 treatment leads to a significant reduction in CD31 staining
and to the obliteration of the normal vasculature that is associated
with tumor angiogenesis. We also calculated the microvessel
density and found it to be significantly decreased following EF24
treatment (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
Our results indicate that the novel curcumin analogue EF24
possesses great potential as a promising anti–colon therapeutic
agent. Colon cancer is a common malignancy in economically

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (6). March 15, 2008

developed countries, particularly in North America, Europe, and
Australia, and has emerged as one of the leading causes of cancerrelated deaths in the Western world. The significant morbidity
of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy for colon cancer has led
searches for less toxic alternative therapies. Many studies have
shown that curcumin suppresses the proliferation of a variety of
tumor cells, including breast, colon, oral, lung, melanoma, myeloma, leukemia, and prostate carcinoma (10, 11, 35–43). The data
presented in the article show that EF24 selectively inhibits the
proliferation of colon cancer cells, suppresses the formation of
colon cancer cell colonies, inhibits cell survival signaling, promotes
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and inhibits cancer-promoting
genes. In vivo, EF24 decreases tumor size, volume, and microvessel
density and suppresses mRNA expression and protein levels of the
colon cancer–promoting genes COX-2, IL-8, and VEGF.
Because curcumin is poorly absorbed through the intestine,
more potent and soluble curcumin analogues have been developed
(17). Furthermore, as shown in our studies, at low doses, curcumin
did not have a therapeutic effect. Similar results were observed in
studies on squamous cell carcinomas, where a dose of 3.75 Amol/L
curcumin did not affect growth of the cells (44). Consequently,
higher doses are required. Synthetic chemical analogues to molecularly targeted chemotherapeutic drugs and chemopreventative
photochemical confound a myriad of molecular events in host
and tumor tissues. These events include the acquisition of selfsufficient growth signals, insensitivity to signals that usually inhibit
proliferation, use of survival pathways to evade apoptosis, initiation of angiogenesis to ensure sufficient oxygen and nutrient

disrupting many of the characteristic cancer-promoting events
more effectively than curcumin. EF24 inhibits proliferation of

HCT-116 colon cancer cells, promotes apoptosis, prevents angiogenesis of tumors in mice xenografts, and decreases tumor growth.
In cell cycle analyses, EF24 was observed to increase the number

significantly higher levels of apoptosis. These data imply that EF24
treatment leads to mitotic catastrophe in which the proliferating
cancer cells undergo cell death but not necessarily an arrest in the
G2-M phase of the cell cycle. This was further supported through
our observation that the majority of cells were present in the subG0 phase at 48 h following treatment.
The effects of EF24 on in vivo activity are dependent on the
bioavailability of drug at the site of the tumor. Dietary curcumin
is poorly absorbed through the intestinal tract. This results in
good availability of the compound only to the surface epithelial
cells of the intestine and colon but significantly poor availability
of the compound to those cells that develop at the deeper tissue
locations in the intestine and colon or if the tumor is malignant
and is localized in other sites. This has led to the development of
analogue with better bioavailability. In our studies, we observed
marked suppression of tumor growth in mice xenograft with EF24
treatment. However, further studies are needed to confirm and
extend the present study to use EF24 as an effective therapy for
colorectal cancer. Absorption and pharmacokinetic properties of

preliminary studies indicate that EF24 seems to have low toxicity in
liver, kidney, and spleen and allows mice treated with EF24 to
maintain normal weight gain (19). In addition, EF24, like curcumin,
seems to mediate its actions through multiple molecular targets,
including COX-2, VEGF, and IL-8. Because COX-2 overexpression
during colon carcinogenesis causes resistance to apoptosis (46),
treatment of colon cancer cells with EF24 may potentially restore
susceptibility to apoptosis. Furthermore, IL-8 overexpression has
been correlated with the inflammation-related risk of sporadic
colorectal cancer (47), so treatment with EF24 may also potentially
ameliorate the inflammatory responses that are associated with the
development of cancer. Finally, VEGF is important in angiogenesis
and promotion of tumor growth, and the ability of EF24 to inhibit
VEGF expression is yet another molecular mechanism by which
EF24 may function to prevent colorectal cancer.
In this study, we have shown that EF24 suppressed EGF-mediated
signaling. However, colon cancer cells, including HCT-116 cells,
are known to express autocrine factors such as prostaglandins,

insulin-like growth factors, and progastrin, which activate many
cellular pathways (48–53). It would be interesting to determine
whether EF24 is equally potent in inhibiting these signal
transduction pathways.
In conclusion, our studies show that EF24 treatment of intestinal
cancer cells results in growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Our
in vitro and in vivo studies in combination with the observation
that EF24 does not affect proliferation of normal human fibroblasts strongly suggest that EF24 has promising potential for use
as a therapeutic or chemopreventative agent for intestinal cancer.
Similar to curcumin, EF24 also seems to have multiple molecular
targets and its enhanced potency in cancer cell lines and xenograft
