Abstract
Oxidative and electrophilic stresses are sensed by Keap1,
which activates Nrf2 to achieve cytoprotection by regulating
the expression of drug-metabolizing and antioxidative
stress enzymes/proteins. Because oxidative and electrophilic
stresses cause many diseases, including cancer, we hypothesized that an abnormality in the Nrf2-Keap1 system may
facilitate the growth of cancer cells. We sequenced the KEAP1
gene of 65 Japanese patients with lung cancer and identified
five nonsynonymous somatic mutations at a frequency of 8%.
We also identified two nonsynonymous somatic KEAP1 gene
mutations and two lung cancer cell lines expressing KEAP1 at
reduced levels. In lung cancer cells, low Keap1 activity (due to
mutations or low-level expression) led to nuclear localization
and constitutive activation of Nrf2. The latter resulted in
constitutive expression of cytoprotective genes encoding
multidrug resistance pumps, phase II detoxifying enzymes,
and antioxidative stress enzymes/proteins. Up-regulation of
these target genes in lung cancer cells led to cisplatin
resistance. Nrf2 activation also stimulated growth of lung
cancer–derived cell lines expressing KEAP1 at low levels and
in mutant cell lines and in Keap1-null mouse embryonic
fibroblasts under homeostatic conditions. Thus, inhibition of
NRF2 may provide new therapeutic approaches in lung
cancers with activation of Nrf2. [Cancer Res 2008;68(5):1303–9]

Introduction
Oxidative and electrophilic stresses provoke cellular adaptive
responses that induce the expression of genes that encode various
cytoprotective enzymes. This process is closely related to human
diseases, including cancer. Among the cytoprotective gene
products, phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes and antioxidative
stress enzymes/proteins are encoded by genes that are regulated by
a motif called the antioxidant/electrophile-responsive element
(1–3). The transcription factor Nrf2 forms a heterodimer with one
of the small Maf family proteins, and the complex binds to the
antioxidant-responsive element to activate transcription of these

cytoprotective genes (4). Keap1 is a newly identified Nrf2associated protein (5), containing BTB, IVR, and DGR domains
(6). These domains contribute to the dual function of Keap1. Keap1
interacts specifically with an adaptor protein, Cullin 3 (Cul3), and
forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase to render substrate Nrf2 susceptible
to rapid degradation/turnover (7). Keap1 also functions as a sensor
for electrophilic/oxidative stresses. In the absence of stress stimuli,
Nrf2 is rapidly degraded through the proteasome pathway using
ubiquitination by the Keap1-Cul3 E3 ligase (7). On exposure to
stress, Keap1 is modified, and Nrf2 is freed from the modified
Keap1, translocates into the nucleus, and activates the transcription of various cytoprotective genes (7). The rapid degradation of
Nrf2 by Keap1-Cul3 E3 ligase constitutes the molecular basis for
induction of cytoprotective enzymes in response to stress.
Nrf2-deficient mice are susceptible to electrophilic/oxidative
stresses due to impaired expression of cytoprotective enzymes/
proteins (8). This observation strongly supports the essential
contribution of Nrf2 to both basal and inducible expression of
cytoprotective enzymes and suggests new possibilities for environmental response studies (9). Similarly, Keap1-deficient mice
constitutively express cytoprotective and antioxidant enzymes/
proteins (10), indicating that the Nrf2-Keap1 system functions
physiologically for cytoprotection against environmental stresses.
The ubiquitin proteasome system using Cullin-type E3 ligases
shares a similar role in critical stress responses. For instance, the
transcription factors InB (11) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (12)
use Cul1 and Cul2, respectively, to form specific E3 ligases.
Inhibition of rapid turnover/repression is a common (and
evolutionarily ancient) strategy animals have acquired for rapid
responses to environmental changes.
To our surprise, however, we identified somatic mutations in the
KEAP1 gene of Japanese patients with lung cancer and in lung
cancer cell lines (13). These KEAP1 mutations affected the
repressive activity of Keap1, stimulated nuclear accumulation
of Nrf2, and induced constitutive expression of cytoprotective
enzymes within the cancer cells. More recently, somatic mutations
in KEAP1 were detected in 19% of Caucasian patients with lung
cancer (14). Collectively, these observations suggest that the Nrf2Keap1 pathway acts as a double-edged sword: it protects the body
from chemical carcinogenesis but aids the growth and development of cancer cells (13). To examine the characteristics of KEAP1
mutations further and to address whether they provide selective
advantages for cancer progression, we analyzed the expression and
mutation of the KEAP1 gene in samples from Japanese patients
with lung cancer and in established lung cancer cell lines. We

identified the molecular basis of these loss-of-function type
somatic mutations in patients with lung cancer and found that
they provided advantages to lung cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Tissue samples and cell lines. Tumor tissues were obtained with
informed consent from patients who received surgical treatment at the
National Cancer Center Hospital. Lung cancer cell lines SQ-19, H2126,
H1437, H1395, and A549 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection; II-18 was obtained from Riken Bio Resource Center; and RERFLC-MS was obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources
Cell Bank. All cell lines were maintained in DMEM with 10% calf serum, 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), or 20% FBS containing F-12 nutrient mixture.
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were prepared from individual embryos
at embryonic day 13.5. The head and internal organs were removed, and the
torso was minced and dispersed in 0.25% trypsin/EDTA. MEFs were
maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Briefly, MEFs at less than five
passages were used as early-passage primary MEFs. To immortalize MEFs,
the fibroblasts were cultured continuously until the fibroblasts started
growing rapidly. Immortalization of the primary MEFs was usually observed
after 25 passages.
Sequencing of KEAP1. DNAs extracted from cancer tissues and cell
lines were amplified according to a ligation-mediated PCR method using a
high-fidelity DNA polymerase, KOD Plus, and were used for sequencing (15).
PCR primers were designed to amplify every exon plus f100 bases flanking
each exon. Reference sequence of the KEAP1 gene was retrieved from public
database Genbank.8 Sequencing was performed using the following primer
sets: exon 2, 5¶-TGCAAATGGATTCTGCTTCACCTACTTTGCAGGAA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TGAGCCCAGAACCTCCTTTTTCTCCAGTTTC-3¶ (reverse);
exon 3, 5¶-TATTTGAATCCCCATTTAGCAGATAAGGAAGCTGA-3¶ ( forward)
and 5¶-TAGAACTCTCCAAGGAGCTTAGCTTCATCCTGAG-3¶ (reverse); exon
4, 5¶-ATGAGCCATCGCGCCGGATGAACCTGTCTCTTTAA-3¶ ( forward) and
5¶-CTCTATCAGAATCCAGGGCTTCTGTGGTTA-3¶ (reverse); exon 5, 5¶-TTCTGAGGGTGAGAAGGGAGAGGAGAGAGGAAA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-AGCTGGGCAACAGAGCGAGACCTTGTTTCTAA-3¶ (reverse); and exon 6, 5¶-TGCCTCAGCCCTGCAAAGTGCTAGGATTATAGG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-CTTTGGACTTCTTTTGAGATGTCATTTTAACACTG-3¶ (reverse).
Plasmid construction and reporter assay. Flag-tagged KEAP1 and its
mutations were inserted in pCMV-tag2A (Stratagene). Transfections of
expression vectors, the luciferase reporter pRBGP2 containing three copies
of Nrf2-binding element (16), and pRL-TK were carried out using
Lipofectamine Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). After 36 h of transfection, the
cells in 24-well plates were washed by PBS and analyzed for luciferase

activities in triplicate in each transfection experiment using Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega). All experiments were repeated at least
thrice.
Immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and in vivo ubiquitination assays. Immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence microscopy, and
in vivo ubiquitination assays were performed as described previously (7).
Real-time PCR. Total RNAs were isolated from cell lines by Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNAs were obtained from total RNA
(5 Ag) by SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Real-time
PCR was performed by ABI 7000 (Applied Biosystems) using the following
primer sets: KEAP1, 5¶-TACGATGTGGAAACAGAGACGTGGACTTTCGTA-3¶
( forward) and 5¶-TCAACAGGTACAGTTCTGGTCAATCTGCTT-3¶ (reverse);
NADPH dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1), 5¶-AGGAAGAGCTAATAAATCTCTTCTTTGCTG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TCATATTGCAGATGTACGGTGTGGATTTAT-3¶ (reverse); multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3), 5¶-GACCATCGCACACCGGCTTAACACTATCATGGA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TCAGTACTCCCATTTTTAATGGATTCAGGCAGCA-3¶ (reverse); and PRDX1, 5¶-AAGTGATTGGTGCTTCTGTGGATTCTCACT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TCACTTCTGCTTGGAGAAATATTCTTTGCTC-3¶ (reverse). GAPD gene was used
as an internal control. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed
using primer sets as same as real-time PCR.
Small interfering RNA and cell growth analysis. For the small
interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments, 20 nmol/L of control siRNA (Qiagen)
and NRF2-specific siRNA (SI03246950; Qiagen) were used. Transfection was
performed as described previously (17). RT-PCR was performed after 3 days
and cell numbers were counted after 7 days.

Results and Discussion
To explore somatic mutations in KEAP1 genes of lung cancer
patients, we designed a sequencing system for protein-coding

exons and exon-intron boundaries of the gene. Exploiting this
system, we sequenced KEAP1 genes of primary lung cancer
tissues from 65 Japanese patients, including 29 with adenocarcinoma, 26 with squamous cell carcinoma, 8 with small cell
carcinoma, and 2 with large cell carcinoma (Supplementary
Table S1). We identified five somatic mutations associated with
amino acid changes (Table 1; Fig. 1), indicating that f8% (5 of
65) of Japanese lung cancer patients had a somatic mutation in
the protein. In this analysis, we also found two somatic mutations
in the intron region (data not shown).
Mutations in the KEAP1 gene were detected frequently (10%; 3 of
29) in Japanese lung adenocarcinoma cases (Table 1). In a study of
Caucasian (14), KEAP1 somatic mutations were detected in 19%
(10 of 54) of all lung cancer cases and in 26% (9 of 35) of
adenocarcinoma cases. Thus, our present results indicate a high
incidence/frequency of KEAP1 somatic mutations in patients with
lung adenocarcinoma independent of the patients’ geographic
origin. Whereas the alterations in Caucasians were composed of
four missense point mutations and six deletion/insertion mutations, all of the mutations found in the current study were missense
mutations. Thus, the frequency of KEAP1 missense mutations in
Japanese lung adenocarcinoma cases (3 of 29) is very similar to that
in Caucasians (4 of 35). Because no deletion/insertion mutations in
KEAP1 were identified in Japanese lung adenocarcinoma cases,
further exploration of the KEAP1 mutations in Japanese lung
cancer cases is necessary. We also identified amino acid changes as

homozygous gene mutations in KEAP1 in one cancer tissue and in
two lung cancer–derived cell lines (Table 1). Microsatellite-based
genotyping of lung cancer tissues showed loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) at 19p13.2 (containing the KEAP1 gene locus) in 41% of
cases (14), suggesting that the homozygous gene mutations that we
identified (Table 1; Fig. 1B) might contain LOH at the KEAP1 gene
locus.
All of the mutations identified in this study were located within
the IVR and DGR domains of Keap1 (Table 1; Fig. 1A). The IVR
domain is responsible for the ubiquitination of Nrf2 (7), and the
DGR domain interacts with Nrf2 (5). To examine the molecular
defects caused by these mutations, we asked whether mutant
Keap1 has the ability to interact with Nrf2 and sequester it in the
cytoplasm. To this end, we transfected enhanced green fluorescent
protein (EGFP)-fused Nrf2 (Nrf2-GFP) with a Flag-tagged Keap1
mutant into NIH3T3 cells and examined the cellular localization of
GFP. We also used an immunohistochemical procedure with an
anti-Flag antibody. Nrf2-GFP accumulated in the cytoplasm in
wild-type (WT) Keap1 and Keap1 H200P mutant cells. In contrast,
Nrf2-GFP accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 2A) on cotransfection
with R415G or G430C mutants (13), indicating that the latter two
mutants lost their ability to bind and sequester Nrf2 in the
cytoplasm. In the case of the R272C mutant, Nrf2 resided both in
the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (Fig. 2A).
To elucidate whether these Keap1 mutants interacted physically
with Nrf2, we performed an immunoprecipitation analysis. When

A, Nrf2 degradation activity of Keap1 and its mutants.
Expression plasmid (100 ng) for HA-Nrf2 and Flag-Keap1
(lanes 1 and 2) or Keap1 mutants (lanes 3 and 4) was
transfected into NIH3T3 cell. Twenty-four hours after
transfection, cells were treated with (lanes 1 and 3) or
without (lanes 2 and 4) MG132 (2 Amol/L) for 12 h.
HA-Nrf2 and Flag-Keap1 or its mutants in whole-cell
lysates were examined by anti-HA (Nrf2) and anti-Flag
(Keap1) antibodies. B, association activity of Keap1 R272C
mutant with Cul3. Expression plasmid (100 ng) for HA-Cul3
and Flag-Keap1 (lane 1) or R272C mutant (lane 2)
was transfected into 293T cells. HA-Cul3 was
immunoprecipitated from whole-cell lysates (Input ) using
anti-HA antibody and precipitants were analyzed by
anti-Flag antibody M2-conjugated agarose (IP with a-HA ).
C, ubiquitination of Nrf2 by Keap1 and R272C mutant.
Expression plasmid (1 Ag) for HA-Nrf2 and Flag-Keap1 WT
(lane 1), Keap1 R272C mutant (lane 2 ), or empty vector
(lane 3) was transfected into 293T cells with His-tagged
ubiquitin (Ub ; 3 Ag). HA-Nrf2 was immunoprecipitated from
whole-cell lysates using anti-HA antibody and ubiquitinated
Nrf2 (Nrf2-Ub) was analyzed by anti-His antibody.
D, nuclear localization of Nrf2 in lung cancer cell line
with R272C mutation. Nrf2 in H2126 (R272C mutant) cells
was stained by anti-Nrf2 antibody. Nrf2 signals (green )
were observed within the nucleus and the cytoplasm.

Flag-tagged Keap1 or Keap1 mutants were transfected into NIH3T3
cells concomitant with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Nrf2, WT Keap1
and Keap1 H200P and R272C mutants (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3) were
immunoprecipitated with Nrf2 by an anti-Flag antibody. In
contrast, Nrf2 was not coimmunoprecipitated efficiently with
Keap1 R415G and G430C mutants (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). These
results are consistent with the subcellular localization analysis and
show that R415G and G430C mutants in the DGR domain impair
the association of Keap1 with Nrf2.
To examine how those Keap1 mutations affected the repressive
activity of Keap1 against Nrf2, we performed a reporter
cotransfection-transactivation analysis. Keap1 or individual Keap1
mutants were cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells with an Nrf2
expression plasmid and a luciferase reporter pRBGP2 (16).
Luciferase activity was repressed significantly when WT Keap1 or
the H200P mutant was transfected simultaneously (Fig. 2C, lanes 3
and 4). We did not detect any effects of the H200P mutant. In
contrast, cotransfection of R272C, R415G, or G430C mutants (Fig.
2C, lanes 5–7) had no effect on luciferase reporter activity,
suggesting that the latter three mutations affected the capacity of
Keap1 to repress Nrf2. Significantly, the loss of repressive activity in
R415G and G430C mutants correlated well with the loss of
interaction with Nrf2.
Because we identified R415G and G430C mutants as heterozygous gene mutations in lung cancer, we asked whether the Keap1
mutant affected WT Keap1 activity. Toward that end, pRBGP2
reporter activity was examined in NIH3T3 cells after cotransfection
with WT Keap1 and graded doses of the R415G or G430C mutants.
The repressive activity of WT Keap1 decreased with increments of

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (5). March 1, 2008

the R415G or G430C mutants (Fig. 2D, lanes 3–8 and 6–8),
suggesting that these mutants repressed WT Keap1 in a dominantnegative manner. Thus, heterozygous mutation of KEAP1 can also
activate Nrf2 through its dominant-negative function. In this
regard, it is interesting to note the recently proposed two-site
substrate recognition model for Keap1-Nrf2 interaction (18). In this
model, one Keap1 homodimer associates with two sites of Nrf2,
and this interaction is essential for ubiquitination of Nrf2. We
surmise that the R415G or G430C mutant dimerizes with WT
Keap1 to form a nonfunctional Keap1 heterodimer.
In contrast to the R415G and G430C mutants, the R272C mutant
retained binding activity to Nrf2 but lost Nrf2 repressive activity
(Fig. 2A–C). We hypothesized that this mutant in IVR might impair
Nrf2 degradation, as the IVR domain of KEAP1 is responsible
for the degradation of Nrf2 (7). To test this hypothesis, we
expressed Nrf2 and WT Keap1 or the R272C mutant in NIH3T3
cells, and the stability of Nrf2 protein was determined. Whereas the
Nrf2 level was very low in the cells cotransfected with WT Keap1,
treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 stabilized
the Nrf2 protein (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). The Nrf2 level in cells
cotransfected with the R272C mutant was very high and was not
induced effectively by MG132 (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). These results
indicate that the R272C mutant impaired Nrf2 degradation.
To determine whether the R272C mutant binds Cul3 in the cells,
we then performed an immunoprecipitation analysis. When Flagtagged Keap1 or the R272C mutant was transfected with HA-tagged
Cul3 into 293T cells, Cul3 was coimmunoprecipitated with both
the WT Keap1 and the R272C mutant (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2),
indicating that R272C binds to Cul3 as WT Keap1 does. We also

performed an in vivo ubiquitination analysis to determine how the
R272C-Cul3 complex contributed to ubiquitination of Nrf2. For this
purpose, either Flag-tagged WT Keap1 or the R272C mutant was
transfected into 293T cells concomitant with HA-tagged Nrf2 and
His-tagged ubiquitin, and HA-Nrf2 was immunoprecipitated by an
anti-HA antibody. Nrf2 ubiquitination was detected by immunoblot
analysis with an anti-histidine antibody. Nrf2 ubiquitination was
stimulated significantly by WT Keap1 (Fig. 3C, lane 1) but not by
the R272C mutant (Fig. 3C, lane 2). We previously found that Cys273
and Cys288 of Keap1 are essential for the ubiquitination of Nrf2
(7). Therefore, we speculated that the association between the
R272C mutant and Cul3 may be inadequate for the ubiquitination
of Nrf2.
The molecular basis by which the R272C mutant lost the
capacity to degrade Nrf2 is unclear. However, further studies in this
area should help elucidate the mechanism by which Keap1-Cul3 E3
ligase degrades Nrf2. In this regard, it is interesting to note that
endogenous Nrf2 is located in the nucleus of H2126 cells harboring
the R272C mutation, even in the absence of stress stimuli (Fig. 3D),
suggesting that the stabilized Nrf2 protein could enter the nucleus
in homeostatic conditions.
Next, we used real-time PCR to analyze the expression level of
the KEAP1 gene in primary lung cancer tissues and normal tissues
from adenocarcinoma patients. We found lower levels of expression of KEAP1 in cancer tissue (Fig. 4A, P#4). We next analyzed the

expression level of the KEAP1 gene in six lung cancer cell lines by
real-time PCR and found a reduction of KEAP1 gene expression in
two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, H1437 and II-18 (Fig. 4B, lanes
2 and 5). These observations imply that reduced expression of the
KEAP1 gene may occur frequently in lung cancer, as is the case for
the somatic mutations. To examine the subcellular localization of
Nrf2 in cells expressing lower levels of KEAP1, we identified
endogenous Nrf2 using confocal laser scanning microscopy. We
found that endogenous Nrf2 was localized in the nuclei of H1437,
II-18, and A549 (G333C; ref. 14) cells with the KEAP1 mutation
(Fig. 4C). However, it was not located in the nuclei of SQ-19 cells
with normal KEAP1 (Fig. 4C). Showing very good agreement,
high-level expression of the two target genes, NQO1 (19) and MRP3
(20), was detected by real-time PCR analysis in H1437, II-18, and
A549 cells but not in SQ-19 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). This
result correlated with the expression of the two target genes,
NQO1 and MRP3, in cancer tissues expressing KEAP1 at lower
levels (Supplementary Figs. S1A and S4A). Expression levels of
NQO1 and MRP3 were decreased by transfection of WT KEAP1
gene into II-18 and A549 cells (data not shown). These results show
that loss of Keap1 activity in these cells consistently enhanced the
nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and contributed to the increased
expression of cytoprotective enzymes/proteins.
Because Nrf2 induces detoxifying enzymes and multidrugresistant pumps, cell lines expressing lower levels of KEAP1

tissues and lung cancer tissues. The KEAP1 expression levels of normal lung tissues (N ) and lung cancer tissues (T ) from five Japanese patients with
adenocarcinomas (P#1 to P#5) were analyzed by real-time PCR. Level of KEAP1 gene expression in each normal tissue was set at 1.0. GAPD gene was used as an
internal control. B, expression of KEAP1 gene of six lung cancer cell lines. The expression levels of the cell lines RERF-LC-MS (lane 1), II-18 (lane 2 ), SQ-19 (lane 3),

GAPD gene was used as an internal control. C, nuclear localizations of Nrf2 in lung cancer cell lines with KEAP1 lower expression and mutation. Nrf2 in SQ-19 (normal
KEAP1 ), II-18 (low expression of KEAP1 ), H1437 (low expression of KEAP1 ), or A549 (C333A mutant of KEAP1 ) cells was stained by anti-Nrf2 antibody. Nrf2
signals (green ) were observed within the nucleus with a punctuate pattern and in regions with little blue 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole signal in II-18, H1437, and A549
cells but not in SQ-19 cells. D, Nrf2-mediated gene expression provides drug resistance in lung cancer cell lines. SQ-19, II-18, H1437, or A549 cells were exposed to
incremental amounts of cisplatin (0, 3, 6 and 12 Amol/L), and after 10 d, viable cells were determined. Data are presented as percentage of viable cells relative to
the DMSO-treated control cells.

Figure 5. The activated Nrf2 actually
provides growth advantages to the lung
cancer cells under homeostatic condition.
A, knockdown of NRF2 expression by
NRF2 -specific siRNA. The control siRNA
(lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 , and 17) or
the siRNA specific for NRF2 (lanes 2, 4, 6,
8, 10, 12, 14, 16 , and 18) was transfected
into SQ-19 (lanes 1, 2, 7, 8, 13, and 14),
II-18 (lanes 3, 4, 9, 10, 15 , and 16), and
A549 (lanes 5, 6, 11, 12, 17 , and 18 ) cells.
Three days after transfection, cells were
collected. The expression levels of NRF2,
NQO1 , and MRP3 in the cells were
analyzed by real-time PCR. B, knockdown
of NRF2 expression by NRF2 -specific
siRNA decreased the growth rate of KEAP1
mutation or lower-expression cells. The
control siRNA or the siRNA specific
for NRF2 was transfected into SQ-19
(lanes 1 and 2 ), II-18 (lanes 3 and 4),
and A549 (lanes 5 and 6) cells as same as
in A . Seven days after transfection, cells
were collected and counted. C, Keap1
deletion increases the growth rate of
immortalized MEF cells. Immortalized MEF
(KEAP1 +/+, Keap1 +/ , and Keap1 / )
cells were plated at 0.5  104 per 35-mm
dish and incubated. At the indicated time
points, the cells were removed from
the plates with trypsin and counted. The
average numbers of cells at each time
point were determined, and their standard
deviations were obtained and plotted.

should show resistance to chemotherapy reagents. To test this
possibility, we analyzed the sensitivity of these cell lines to
cisplatin. Cell viability was measured 10 days after exposure to
various concentrations of cisplatin. We found that cell lines
expressing lower levels of KEAP1 (H1437 and II-18) and KEAP1
mutant cells (A549) showed greater resistance to cisplatin than
SQ-19 cells with normal KEAP1 (Fig. 4D), indicating that
constitutive activation of Nrf2 enhances resistance to chemotherapy reagents.
Another intriguing possibility is that the constitutive activation
of Nrf2 in cancer cells may confer selective growth advantages to
cancer cells. Indeed, an Nrf2 target gene, PRDX1 (21), enhances cell
growth and radioresistance in the lung cancer cell line A549 (22),
which harbors a mutation in the KEAP1 gene (14). We therefore
used real-time PCR to determine the PRDX1 expression level in cell
lines expressing lower levels of KEAP1. We found that it was higher
in H1437, II-18, and A549 cells than in SQ-19 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). These results support the notion that some of the Nrf2
target genes in lung cancer cells may enhance cancer cell growth.
Therefore, to determine whether knockdown of NRF2 expression
affects the growth of cancer cells with KEAP1 mutation or reduced
expression, we analyzed cell growth for 7 days after transfection of
SQ-19 cells (KEAP1 normal), II-18 cells (low expression of KEAP1),
and A549 cells (KEAP1 mutation) with NRF2-specific siRNA. We
found that knockdown of NRF2 expression (Fig. 5A, lanes 1–6)

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (5). March 1, 2008

reduced expression of its target genes (Fig. 5A, lanes 9–12 and
15–18) and induced growth inhibition (Fig. 5B, lanes 3–6) of II-18
and A549 cells but not of SQ-19 cells [Fig. 5A, lanes 7, 8, 13 and B 1
and 2]. These results suggest that activation of Nrf2 through
reduced Keap1 activity, either through mutation or reduced
expression, provides growth advantages to lung cancer cells under
homeostatic conditions. To further examine the advantages of
cancer cells harboring the KEAP1 mutation, we studied the growth
of Keap1 / MEFs. Both KEAP1 +/+ and Keap1 / MEFs grew at
similar rate during the first few passages (Supplementary Fig. S2).
However, following spontaneous immortalization of MEF cells and
after several passages, Keap1 / cells grew faster than KEAP1 +/+
and Keap1 +/ cells (Fig. 5C). This result supports our contention
that reduced Keap1 activity facilitates cell growth. The molecular
basis of activated Nrf2-stimulated cell growth is unclear. Thus,
further exploration of Nrf2 activation and its effect on cancer cell
growth is necessary.
In summary, we identified somatic mutations of KEAP1 and lowlevel expressions of KEAP1 in lung cancer tissues and cell lines.
These results indicate a high incidence/frequent occurrence of loss
of Keap1 function in patients with lung cancer. The loss of Keap1
function enhanced the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and elevated
the expression of antioxidative and antixenobiotic stress enzymes
and drug efflux pumps, suggesting that cancer cells with weakened
Keap1 function acquire multiple advantages for proliferation.
