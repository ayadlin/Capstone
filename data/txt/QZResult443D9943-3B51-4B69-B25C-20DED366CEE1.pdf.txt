ABSTRACT
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common
and aggressive types of human cancers worldwide. Nearly a half of HNSCC patients
experience recurrence within five years of treatment and develop resistance to
chemotherapy. Thus, there is an urgent clinical need to develop safe and novel
anticancer therapies for HNSCC. Here, we investigate the possibility of repurposing
the anthelmintic drug mebendazole (MBZ) as an anti-HNSCC agent. Using the two
commonly-used human HNSCC lines CAL27 and SCC15, we demonstrate MBZ exerts
more potent anti-proliferation activity than cisplatin in human HNSCC cells. MBZ
effectively inhibits cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and cell migration, and
induces apoptosis of HNSCC cells. Mechanistically, MBZ can modulate the cancerassociated pathways including ELK1/SRF, AP1, STAT1/2, MYC/MAX, although the
regulatory outcomes are context-dependent. MBZ also synergizes with cisplatin
in suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis of human HNSCC cells.
Furthermore, MBZ is shown to promote the terminal differentiation of CAL27 cells
and keratinization of CAL27-derived xenograft tumors. Our results are the first to
demonstrate that MBZ may exert its anticancer activity by inhibiting proliferation
while promoting differentiation of certain HNSCC cancer cells. It’s conceivable the
anthelmintic drug MBZ can be repurposed as a safe and effective agent used in
combination with other frontline chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin in HNSCC
treatment.

INTRODUCTION

than SCC15 cells (Figure 1A ab vs. cd). When these
cells were treated with MBZ, CAL27 cell proliferation
was inhibited at 0.2 µM MBZ, or more pronouncedly at
0.4 µM (Figure 1B-ab), while SCC15 cells were markedly
inhibited at 0.5 µM MBZ (Figure 1B-cd). These in vitro
results demonstrate that MBZ exhibits more potent
anti-proliferation activity in HNSCC cells than that
of cisplatin’s. Furthermore, SCC15 cells were shown
relatively insensitive to cisplatin, but can be effectively
inhibited by MBZ at low concentrations, suggesting
that a combination of MBZ and cisplatin may act more
effectively on inhibiting HNSCC cell proliferation.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
is the sixth most common cancer by incidence worldwide
with an annual incidence of approximately 600,000 cases
[1–3]. The overall survivals at two and five years are 70%
and 55%, but the recurrence-free survivals at two and five
years are only 60% and 52%, respectively [3, 4]. Thus, it
is urgent to improve the five-year survival rate of HNSCC
patients. Clinically, cisplatin is used as one of the first-tier
chemotherapeutic drugs against human HNSCC although
its therapeutic effect has been less than satisfactory [5].
HNSCC patients receiving chemotherapy still proceed
to the advanced stage, cancer local recurrence, or
metastasizing to regional lymph nodes and/or distant
organs largely due to the development of resistance to
cisplatin and/or other agents [6, 7]. Therefore, there is
an urgent clinical need to develop novel and effective
anticancer agents for efficacious HNSCC treatment.
Repurposing previously approved drugs for cancer
treatment represents an attractive, safe and economical
strategy for cancer drug discovery. Mebendazole (MBZ)
has been one of the most successful antiparasitic drugs and
is used extensively in anthelmintic therapy as MBZ has
been approved by the US FDA to treat parasitic infections
and has a long track-record of safe profiles for human use
and in various animal models [8]. Several studies indicate
that MBZ and/or its derivative flubendazole exerted
anticancer activities in several types of human cancers
[8–20]. However, it is not clear if MBZ exhibits any
cytotoxicity in HNSCC cancer cells.
Here, we investigate whether MBZ exerts any
anticancer activity and synergizes with the chemotherapy
agent cisplatin in HNSCC cancer cells. Using the two
commonly-used HNSCC lines CAL27 and SCC15 [21–23],
we demonstrate that MBZ markedly inhibits cell
proliferation and induces apoptosis in HNSCC cells.
MBZ is shown to exhibit synergistic anticancer activity
with cisplatin. MBZ promotes the terminal differentiation
of CAL27 cells and keratinization of CAL27-derived
xenograft tumors.

MBZ effectively inhibits cell proliferation and
cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis of
human HNSCC cells
We further evaluated anti-proliferative effect of
MBZ using the more sensitive and quantitative WST-1
proliferation assay. When subconfluent CAL27 and
SCC15 cells were treated different concentrations of
MBZ, a significant inhibition of cell proliferation was
observed at concentrations as low as 0.4 μM MBZ in
CAL27 (p < 0.01) and 0.2 μ M MBZ in SCC15 (p < 0.05)
(Figure 2A-ab). The calculated IC50 values are 1.28 µM
and 2.64 µM for CAL27 and SCC15 cells, respectively
(Figure 2A). Thus, the WST-1 assay results are largely
consistent with that were obtained from the crystal violet
staining assay shown in Figure 1.
We also examined the effect of MBZ on cell cycle
progression. When CAL27 cells were treated 0.5  µM
or 0.8 µM MBZ, we found the percentage of cells
accumulated in sub-G0/G1 phases increased significantly
(p < 0.001) (Figure 2B-a). Similarly, MBZ treatment
of SCC15 cells at rather low concentrations (0.2 µM or
0.4 µM) even led to more significant accumulations of
sub-G0/G1 cells than that for CAL27 cells’ (Figure 2B-b).
These results suggest that MBZ-inhibited HNSCC cell
proliferation may at least in part cause by suppressing cell
cycle progression.
To understand the possible mechanism underlying
MBZ-induced inhibition of cell proliferation, we also
investigated the effect of MBZ on inducing apoptosis in
HNSCC cells. Treatment of CAL27 cells with 0.2 µM or
0.5 µM MBZ induced significant apoptosis (p < 0.001)
(Figure 2C-ab). SCC15 cells were even more sensitive and
MBZ induced significant apoptosis at low concentrations
(0.2 µM or 0.4 µM) (p < 0.001) (Figure 2C-cd). Thus,
these results demonstrate that MBZ is a potent apoptosis
inducer for HNSCC cells.

RESULTS
Mebendazole (MBZ) exerts more potent antiproliferation activity than cisplatin (CIS) in human head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells
We first compared the anti-proliferative effect of
mebendazole (MBZ) with that of the clinically used
chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin (CIS) in two commonlyused human HNSCC lines CAL27 and SCC15. When
these lines were treated with cisplatin, a dose-dependent
inhibition of cell proliferation was observed (Figure 1A)
and a significant inhibitory effect was seen at 20 µM
and 40 µM for CAL27 and SCC15 cells, respectively,
although CAL27 cells were more sensitive to cisplatin

We analyzed whether MBZ exerts any effect on
cell migration and wound healing in HNSCC cells. When

freshly confluent CAL27 monolayer cells were wounded
and treated with 0, 0.2 µM, 0.4 µM, or 0.6 µM MBZ, we
found the wound closure ratios were inversely correlated
with MBZ concentrations; and the wound gaps failed to
close in the presence of 0.4 µM and 0.6 µM MBZ even
at 36 h after wounding while the control group healed
completely (Figure 3-ab). Similar results were obtained
in MBZ-treated SCC15 monolayer cells, except that the
wound gaps failed to close even at lower concentrations
of MBZ (0.3 µM and 0.5 µM) (Figure 3-cd). These results
indicate that MBZ can inhibit cell wound healing and
migration of HNSCC cells in a dose-dependent fashion.

in CAL27 and SCC15 cells. These cancer-associated
pathways were previously characterized [24–26]. When
Gaussia luciferase reporters for the eight pathways were
transfected into CAL 27 cells and treated with 0, 0.2, 0.4
or 0.6 µM MBZ for 24 h, Gaussia luciferase activities
of ELK1/SRF, AP1, STAT1/2 and MYC/MAX reporters
were increased in a dose-dependent manner, while HIF1A,
NFKB, RBP-JK and TCF/LEF reporter activities were not
significantly affected (Figure 4A-a). We further extended
the reporter assay time points and found that ELK1/
SRF, AP1, STAT1/2 and MYC/MAX reporter activities
were significantly increased in CAL 27 cells in MBZtreated groups (0.2, 0.4 or 0.6 µM) in a dose-dependent
manner, compared to that of 0 µM MBZ control group’s
(Figure 4A-b). Interestingly, when the same set of four
pathway reporters was assessed in SCC15 cells, we found
MBZ effectively inhibited these reporter activities in a
dose-dependent fashion at most of the tested time points
(Figure 4B). These results suggest that MBZ may exert

pathways differently in CAL27 and SCC15 lines
To explore the possible mechanism underlying
MBZ’s antiproliferative activity, we tested the effect
of MBZ on eight cancer-related pathway reporters

its anticancer activity in a context-dependent manner
although the precise mechanism through which MBZ
suppresses cell proliferation of HNSCC cells remains to
be thoroughly investigated.

these results suggest that MBZ may serve synergy partner
with cisplatin in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation.
The synergistic effect between MBZ and cisplatin
was not only reflected in suppressing cell proliferation
but also shown to effectively induce apoptosis. Hoechst
33258 staining-based flow cytometry analysis indicated
a combination of lower concentration of 0.1 µM MBZ
and 40 µM cisplatin achieved a similar apoptotic effect
to that of a higher concentration of MBZ alone in CAL27
(Figure 6A). Similar synergistic pro-apoptotic effect was
found in SCC15 cells both in a combination of lower
concentration of 0.1 µM MBZ and 50 µM cisplatin and
higher concentration of 0.3 µM MBZ and 50 µM cisplatin
(Figure 6B). Thus, these results indicate that MBZ can
synergize with cisplatin in inhibiting proliferation and
inducing apoptosis of human HNSCC cells.

MBZ synergizes with cisplatin in suppressing
cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis of
human HNSCC cells
MBZ was shown more potent than cisplatin in
suppressing cell proliferation (Figure 1). Since cisplatin is
currently used as a front line treatment of HNSCC cancers,
we tested if MBZ and cisplatin would act synergistically
to inhibit cell proliferation. Crystal violet staining assay
indicated when CAL27 and SCC15 cells were treated
varied concentrations of MBZ and/or cisplatin, there was
a consistent trend showing more efficient inhibition of cell
proliferation when both MBZ and cisplatin were presented
(Figure 5A-ab). A more quantitative WST-1 assay revealed
similar results in both CAL27 cells (Figure 5B-a) and
SCC15 cells (Figure 5B-b). Furthermore, quantitative
calculations of the combination index (CI) using the
Chou-Talalay method [27] indicate that MBZ was shown
to synergize with cisplatin (i.e., CI < 1) in both CAL27
cells (Figure 5B-c) and SCC15 cells (Figure 5B-d). Thus,

MBZ inhibits cell proliferation and induces
keratinization of CAL27 cells in vivo
We next sought to test the in vivo anti-cancer
activity of MBZ in a xenograft tumor model of human
HNSCC line CAL27 cells. We chose CAL27 line because
this line exhibited rather unexpected activation of several
cancer-related pathways upon MBZ treatment (Figure 4).

When the firefly-luciferase-tagged CAL27 cells were
injected subcutaneously and treated with MBZ or vehicle
control, whole body bioluminescence imaging did not
show any significant difference in signal intensity at
both day 16 and day 31 after treatment (Figure 7A-a).
In fact, the total volume of the tumor masses retrieved
from the MBZ treatment group was shown larger than
that of the control group’s (Figure 7A-b). However,
histologic evaluation of the retrieved tumor samples
indicated that the MBZ-treated tumor samples exhibited
extensive keratinization and significantly less cellular,
compared with that of the control group’s (Figure 7B ab
vs. cd). Immunohistochemical staining further confirmed
that MBZ-treated tumor cells exhibited significantly
decreased or diminished expression of cell proliferation
marker PCNA, which was shown highly expressed in
the control group (Figure 7C). The in vivo data strongly
suggest that, even though the tumor sizes may not be
significantly reduced, MBZ may effectively inhibit tumor
cell proliferation and promote keratinization and terminal
differentiation of CAL27 cancer cells.
To confirm that MBZ can promote terminal
differentiation of CAL27 cancer cells, we examined the
expression of keratinocyte differentiation markers in
MBZ-treated cells and xenograft tumors. When CAL27

cells were treated with MBZ, we found the expression of
the differentiation markers, such as keratin 8, keratin 14,
keratin 18, keratin 19, RARα and RARγ, was significantly
up-regulated, compared with that of the control’s
(Figure 7D-a). Furthermore, we analyzed the expression
levels of these markers in the tumor samples retrieved from
MBZ or DMSO-treated animals, and found that except
keratin 14 all of the other markers expressed significantly
higher in MBZ-treated samples (Figure 7D-b).
Thus, these results demonstrate that MBZ exhibits a strong
differentiation-promoting activity in certain types of
HNSCC cells, such as CAL27. It would thus be interesting
to investigate the mechanism underlying MBZ-induced
differentiation-promoting anticancer activity.

DISCUSSION
HNSCC cancers are often associated with
locoregional recurrence and lymph node metastasis,
leading to a dismal 50% 5-year survival rate for the
patients with advanced disease [28]. The survival rate is
further compromised by the development of resistance
to the frontline chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin.
Thus, there is an urgent need to find novel and effective
therapies to combat HNSCC. We demonstrate two

commonly used HNSCC lines CAL27 and SCC15 are
relatively insensitive to cisplatin, and MBZ exhibits more
potent anti-proliferation activity than that of cisplatin’s
in HNSCC cell lines, suggesting MBZ may be explored
as a novel and efficacious anticancer agent for HNSCC
cancers.
As an anthelmintic drug, MBZ has a long
safety track record for its clinical use in children
[10]. Several studies indicate that MBZ and/or its
derivative flubendazole exerted anticancer activities in
adrenocortical carcinoma [9], glioblastoma multiform
[8], medulloblastoma [10], melanoma [11], leukemia
and myeloma [12], non-small cell lung cancer [13, 14],
cholangiocarcinoma [15], gastric cancer [16], colon cancer
[17], and breast cancer [18–20]. However, the antitumor
effect of MBZ in HNSCC has yet to be investigated.
Here, we demonstrate that MBZ effectively inhibits cell
proliferation and cell cycle progression, suppresses cell
migration and induces apoptosis in both HNSCC lines
CAL27 and SCC15. Our findings are supported by recent
studies about MBZ’s anticancer activity in several types
of cancers. It was shown that MBZ inhibited the growth
of adrenocortical carcinoma cells, as well as the invasion
and migration of cancer cells in vitro, and metastases
formation in vivo [9]. MBZ showed survival benefit in
two preclinical models of glioblastoma multiform [8].
It was postulated that the antitumor activity of MBZ in
medulloblastoma may be at least partially attributable
to the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis [10]. We found
that MBZ can effectively induce apoptosis and cause cell
arrested in sub-G0/G1 phase in a dose-dependent fashion.
These findings are consistent with other reports in which
MBZ was shown to induce mitotic arrest and apoptosis
by depolymerizing tubulin in non-small cell lung cancer
cells [9, 13].
Like other small molecule drugs, MBZ likely
exerts its functions by modulating multiple signaling
pathways and/or cellular processes. By using a panel
of previously well-characterized cancer-associated
pathway reporter analyses [25, 29–31], we found at least
four pathways, e.g., ELK1/SRF, AP1, STAT1/2, MYC/
MAX, are significantly affected. Interestingly, these four
pathways are modulated by MBZ differently in the two
HNSCC lines, activated in CAL27 cells but inhibited
in SCC15 cells. While it’s expected that MBZ would
inhibit these proliferation-related signaling pathways in
most cancer lines such as SCC15, it’s rather surprising to
find out these four pathway reporters are activated upon
MBZ treatment in CAL27. One possibility is that MBZ
may target certain cellular events downstream of these
pathways so these reporters can be feedback up-regulated
upon MBZ treatment. This phenomenon has been widely
reported for many targeted cancer therapies, such as for
the BRAF inhibitors that can induce high levels of BRAF
expression in BRAFi treated melanoma cells [32–34].
Nonetheless, it’s unclear why MBZ can exert opposite
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

effects on several signaling pathways in CAL27 and
SCC15 cell lines. According to the publically available
database on commonly used cancer cell lines canSAR
(http://cansar.icr.ac.uk) [35], rather distinctive and diverse
genomic changes among CAL27 and SCC15 lines were
found. For example, CAL27 line harbors more than 1,038
gene mutations, compared with 530 gene mutations for
SCC15 cells, while most of them are nonsense or missense
mutations (Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, the gene
copy number variations are also significantly different,
as CAL27 line has 184 genes with gain and 326 genes
with loss whereas SCC15 line has 244 genes with gain and
12 genes with loss. Furthermore, these two lines exhibit
quite different mutation profiles of the genes involved
in cell cycle control, apoptosis and cell proliferation
(Supplementary Table 2). Nonetheless, it remains to be
fully investigated about the exact mechanisms underlying
the opposite responses to MBZ in these two cell lines.
The CAL27 line was originally established in 1982
and is one of the most commonly used HNSCC cancer
lines [36]. In this study, we find that CAL27 cells exhibit
some interesting features in response to MBZ treatment.
As mentioned above, the reporters for ELK1/SRF, AP1,
STAT1/2, MYC/MAX were unexpectedly activated in
CAL27 cells upon MBZ treatment, suggesting that CAL27
cells may harbor certain unique molecular and genetic
features. When the CAL27-derived xenograft tumors
were treated with MBZ, we found that the tumors not only
did not shrink but also grew slightly larger, compared
with that of the control group’s. However, histologic
evaluation revealed the MBZ-treated tumors were largely
keratinized with low cellular components, suggesting
that MBZ may promote CAL27 cells to undergo terminal
differentiation. This possibility was further confirmed by
the MBZ-induced increased expression of keratinocyte
differentiation markers Keratin-8, Keratin-14, Keratin-18,
Keratin-19, RARα, and RARγ [37–39]. It was reported
that overexpression of RARα and RARγ  enhanced
retinoic acids’ ability to induce Keratin 19 expression
[40], and there was an inverse relationship between RARβ
expression and squamous differentiation or keratinization
[41, 42]. Thus, to the best of our knowledge our results are
the time to demonstrate that MBZ can promote terminal
differentiation of certain HNSCC cancer cells.Our results
indicate that MBZ may exert more potent cytotoxicity and
anticancer activity than that of the frontline chemotherapy
drug cisplatin in HNSCC cells. Nonetheless, any effective
clinical management of most cancers usually requires
combination therapies. We demonstrate that MBZ exhibits
a strong synergistic effect with cisplatin in inhibiting cell
proliferation and inducing apoptosis in HNSCC cancer
cells. Thus, it’s conceivable that MBZ can be explored as
a safe and efficacious agent to sensitize HNSCC cancers to
cisplatin in order to maximize the anticancer efficacy and
reduce the adverse effects of cisplatin, although thorough
preclinical and clinical studies are required.

In summary, we demonstrate that MBZ potently
inhibits cell proliferation and migration and induces
apoptosis in the two commonly-used HNSCC cell lines
CAL27 and SCC15. MBZ is shown to synergize anticancer
activity with cisplatin. Mechanistically, MBZ can modulate
several cancer-associated pathways, such as ELK1/SRF,
AP1, STAT1/2, MYC/MAX, although the regulatory
outcomes may be context-dependent. Furthermore, MBZ
promotes the terminal differentiation of CAL27 cells and
keratinization of CAL27-derived xenograft tumors. Our
findings are the first demonstration that MBZ may exert
its anticancer activity by inhibiting cell proliferation while
promoting differentiation of certain HNSCC cancer cells.
Thus, MBZ can be repurposed as a safe and effective agent
used in combination with other frontline chemotherapy
drugs such as cisplatin in HNSCC treatment.

37°C for 30 to 150 min and reading absorbance at 450 nm.
Each assay condition was done in triplicate.

Cell wounding/migration assay
Cell wounding and migration assay was performed
as described [52, 54]. Briefly, freshly confluent HNSCC
cells seeded in 35 mm cell culture dishes were wounded
with sterile micro-pipette tips. At various time points, the
wound healing status at the approximately same locations
was recorded under a bright field microscope. Each assay
condition was done in triplicate.

Apoptosis analysis (Hoechst 33258 staining)
As previously described [29, 54], exponentially
growing CAL27 and SCC15 cells were treated with
varied concentrations of mebendazole or DMSO. At
24 h or 48 h post treatment, cells were collected, fixed
and stained with the Magic Solution (10× stock: 0.5%
NP-40, 3.4% formaldehyde, 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in
PBS). Apoptotic cells were examined and recorded under
a fluorescence microscope. The results were repeated at
least in three independent batches of experiments. The
average numbers of apoptotic cells were calculated by
counting apparent apoptotic cells in at least 10 random
fields at 200× magnification for each assay condition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and chemicals
Human HNSCC lines CAL27 and SCC15 were
purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The cells were
maintained in complete Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 100 units of penicillin
and 100 μg of streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2 as
described [43–45], Unless indicated otherwise, all
chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO) or Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA).

Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle analysis was conducted as previously
described [29]. The exponentially growing CAL27 and
SCC15 cells were seeded in 60mm cell culture dishes
and treated with varied concentrations of mebendazole
or DMSO. At 24 h or 48 h post treatment, cells were
collected and stained with the Magic Solution for 30 min.
The stained cells were subjected to flow cytometry
analysis using BD FACSCalibur-HTS. The acquired flow
cytometry data were analyzed with FlowJo v10.0 software.
Each assay condition was done in triplicate.

Crystal violet cell viability assay
Crystal violet staining assay was conducted as
described [46–51]. Briefly, subconfluent CAL27 and
SCC15 cells were treated with varied concentrations of
cisplatin, mebendazole, or DMSO vehicle control. At
72 h after treatment, cells were gently washed with PBS
and stained with 0.5% crystal violet/formalin solution at
room temperature for 20–30 min. The stained cells were
further washed with tape water and air-dried for taking
macrographic images [52]. For quantitative measurement,
the stained cells were dissolved in 10% acetic acid at
room temperature for 20 min with shaking, followed by
measuring absorbance at 570 nm using the microplate
reader (BioTek EL800, Winooski, VT) [29, 53].

Cell transfection and pathway reporter assay
Gaussia luciferase reporter assay was carried
out as described [45, 55, 56]. The tested cancer-relate
signaling pathway reporters, which were previously
characterized, included HIF1A, ELK1/SRF, AP1, NFκB,
STAT1/2, RBP-Jκ, MYC/MAX and TCF/LEF reporters
[25, 29–31]. Experimentally, subconfluent CAL27 and
SCC15 cells were seeded in 60 mm cell culture dishes
and transfected with 5.0 µg/dish of each reporter plasmid
using PEI (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). At 24 h post
transfection, cells were replated in 24-well plates and
treated with various concentrations of mebendazole or
DMSO control. At 24, 48 or 72 h post treatment, culture
media were taken and subjected to Gaussia luciferase

WST-1 cell proliferation assay
Quantitative cell proliferation was assessed by
using the Premixed WST-1 Reagent (Clontech, Mountain
View, CA) as described [29, 53]. Briefly, subconfluent
CAL27 and SCC15 cells seeded in 96-well plates were
treated with mebendazole and/or cisplatin at the varied
concentrations for 24 h or 48 h. The Premixed WST-1
Reagent was added to each well, followed by incubating at

imaging using Xenogen IVIS 200 Imaging System at days
4, 16, and 31 after treatment. Mice were sacrificed at day
31 and subcutaneous tumor masses were retrieved for
histologic evaluation and qPCR analysis.

Total RNA isolation and touchdown-quantitative
real-time PCR (TqPCR) analysis

H & E staining and immunohistochemical (IHC)
staining of xenograft tumor samples

Subconfluent cells were treated with varied
concentrations of MBZ for 48 h and subjected to total RNA
isolation samples using TRIZOL Reagents (Invitrogen).
Total RNA was also isolated from the MBZ or DMSOtreated CAL27-derived xenograft tumor samples using
TRIZOL Reagents. The isolated RNA was subjected to
reverse transcription reactions with hexamer and M-MuLV
reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,
MA). The cDNA products were used as PCR templates.
The qPCR primers were designed by using Primer3
program [57], and used to amplify the genes of interest
(Supplementary Table 1). TqPCR was carried out by using
SYBR Green-based qPCR analysis on a CFX-Connect
unit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) as described
[29]. The qPCR reactions were done in triplicate. GAPDH
was used as a reference gene.

All retrieved tumor masses were fixed in formalin,
paraffin-embedded, and sectioned. The slides were
deparaffinized, rehydrated and subjected to H & E
staining [26, 59, 60]. IHC staining was performed as
described [61–63]. Briefly, the sections were subjected
to deparaffinization, followed by antigen retrieval and
immunostaining with an anti-PCNA antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). Control IgG and minus primary
antibodies were used as negative controls.

Statistical analysis
Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± standard
deviation. Statistical significance was evaluated by means
of SPSS (version 19.0, IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) [64]
using one-way, two-way, or repeated ANOVA. S-N-K
analysis between groups was also used when necessary. A
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Chou–Talalay drug CI analysis
The combination effects between mebendazole
and cisplatin were calculated by using the Chou–Talalay
method [27]. The dose-dependent curves of each drug
alone and in combination were obtained through WST-1
proliferation assay. These data were then analyzed with
the CompuSyn software (ComboSyn, Inc.). The calculated
combination index (CI) offers the quantitative definition
for additive effect (CI = 1), synergism (CI < 1), or
antagonism (CI > 1) in drug combinations [27].

Xenograft tumors of human CAL27 HNSCC cells
All animal experiments were carried out in
accordance with the approved guidelines approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. CAL27
cells were first stably transduced with firefly luciferaseexpressing piggBac transposon vector pMPB4-Fluc
[53, 58], resulting CAL27-FLuc. The high expression
level of firefly luciferase was verified by luciferase
assay using Promega’s Firefly Luciferase Assay System.
Eexponentially growing CAL27-Fluc cells were collected,
resuspended at 107 cells/ml and injected subcutaneously
into the flanks of athymic nude mice (Harlan Laboratories,
5–6 week old, male, 3 × 106 cells/injection, and 4~6
injections per mouse, 5 mice per group). The mice were
randomly divided into two groups (n = 5 per group). At
four days post injection, the animals were treated with
mebendazole (7.5 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle control
(DMSO) intraperitoneally once every two days. Tumor
growth was monitored by whole body bioluminescence
